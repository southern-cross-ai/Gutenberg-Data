<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>"The Forsyte Saga" was the title originally destined for that
part of it which is called "The Man of Property"; and to adopt it
for the collected chronicles of the Forsyte family has indulged the
Forsytean tenacity that is in all of us. The word Saga might be
objected to on the ground that it connotes the heroic and that
there is little heroism in these pages. But it is used with a
suitable irony; and, after all, this long tale, though it may deal
with folk in frock coats, furbelows, and a gilt-edged period, is
not devoid of the essential heat of conflict. Discounting for the
gigantic stature and blood-thirstiness of old days, as they have
come down to us in fairy-tale and legend, the folk of the old Sagas
were Forsytes, assuredly, in their possessive instincts, and as
little proof against the inroads of beauty and passion as Swithin,
Soames, or even Young Jolyon. And if heroic figures, in days that
never were, seem to startle out from their surroundings in fashion
unbecoming to a Forsyte of the Victorian era, we may be sure that
tribal instinct was even then the prime force, and that "family"
and the sense of home and property counted as they do to this day,
for all the recent efforts to "talk them out."</p>

<p>So many people have written and claimed that their families were
the originals of the Forsytes that one has been almost encouraged
to believe in the typicality of an imagined species. Manners change
and modes evolve, and "Timothy's on the Bayswater Road" becomes a
nest of the unbelievable in all except essentials; we shall not
look upon its like again, nor perhaps on such a one as James or Old
Jolyon. And yet the figures of Insurance Societies and the
utterances of Judges reassure us daily that our earthly paradise is
still a rich preserve, where the wild raiders, Beauty and Passion,
come stealing in, filching security from beneath our noses. As
surely as a dog will bark at a brass band, so will the essential
Soames in human nature ever rise up uneasily against the
dissolution which hovers round the folds of ownership.</p>

<p>"Let the dead Past bury its dead" would be a better saying if
the Past ever died. The persistence of the Past is one of those
tragi-comic blessings which each new age denies, coming cocksure on
to the stage to mouth its claim to a perfect novelty.</p>

<p>But no Age is so new as that! Human Nature, under its changing
pretensions and clothes, is and ever will be very much of a
Forsyte, and might, after all, be a much worse animal.</p>

<p>Looking back on the Victorian era, whose ripeness, decline, and
'fall-of' is in some sort pictured in "The Forsyte Saga," we see
now that we have but jumped out of a frying-pan into a fire. It
would be difficult to substantiate a claim that the case of England
was better in 1913 than it was in 1886, when the Forsytes assembled
at Old Jolyon's to celebrate the engagement of June to Philip
Bosinney. And in 1920, when again the clan gathered to bless the
marriage of Fleur with Michael Mont, the state of England is as
surely too molten and bankrupt as in the eighties it was too
congealed and low-percented. If these chronicles had been a really
scientific study of transition one would have dwelt probably on
such factors as the invention of bicycle, motor-car, and
flying-machine; the arrival of a cheap Press; the decline of
country life and increase of the towns; the birth of the Cinema.
Men are, in fact, quite unable to control their own inventions;
they at best develop adaptability to the new conditions those
inventions create.</p>

<p>But this long tale is no scientific study of a period; it is
rather an intimate incarnation of the disturbance that Beauty
effects in the lives of men.</p>

<p>The figure of Irene, never, as the reader may possibly have
observed, present, except through the senses of other characters,
is a concretion of disturbing Beauty impinging on a possessive
world.</p>

<p>One has noticed that readers, as they wade on through the salt
waters of the Saga, are inclined more and more to pity Soames, and
to think that in doing so they are in revolt against the mood of
his creator. Far from it! He, too, pities Soames, the tragedy of
whose life is the very simple, uncontrollable tragedy of being
unlovable, without quite a thick enough skin to be thoroughly
unconscious of the fact. Not even Fleur loves Soames as he feels he
ought to be loved. But in pitying Soames, readers incline, perhaps,
to animus against Irene: After all, they think, he wasn't a bad
fellow, it wasn't his fault; she ought to have forgiven him, and so
on!</p>

<p>And, taking sides, they lose perception of the simple truth,
which underlies the whole story, that where sex attraction is
utterly and definitely lacking in one partner to a union, no amount
of pity, or reason, or duty, or what not, can overcome a repulsion
implicit in Nature. Whether it ought to, or no, is beside the
point; because in fact it never does. And where Irene seems hard
and cruel, as in the Bois de Boulogne, or the Goupenor Gallery, she
is but wisely realistic&mdash;knowing that the least concession is
the inch which precedes the impossible, the repulsive ell.</p>

<p>A criticism one might pass on the last phase of the Saga is the
complaint that Irene and Jolyon those rebels against
property&mdash;claim spiritual property in their son Jon. But it
would be hypercriticism, as the tale is told. No father and mother
could have let the boy marry Fleur without knowledge of the facts;
and the facts determine Jon, not the persuasion of his parents.
Moreover, Jolyon's persuasion is not on his own account, but on
Irene's, and Irene's persuasion becomes a reiterated: "Don't think
of me, think of yourself!" That Jon, knowing the facts, can realise
his mother's feelings, will hardly with justice be held proof that
she is, after all, a Forsyte.</p>

<p>But though the impingement of Beauty and the claims of Freedom
on a possessive world are the main prepossessions of the Forsyte
Saga, it cannot be absolved from the charge of embalming the
upper-middle class. As the old Egyptians placed around their
mummies the necessaries of a future existence, so I have
endeavoured to lay beside the figures of Aunts Ann and Juley and
Hester, of Timothy and Swithin, of Old Jolyon and James, and of
their sons, that which shall guarantee them a little life
here-after, a little balm in the hurried Gilead of a dissolving
"Progress."</p>

<p>If the upper-middle class, with other classes, is destined to
"move on" into amorphism, here, pickled in these pages, it lies
under glass for strollers in the wide and ill-arranged museum of
Letters. Here it rests, preserved in its own juice: The Sense of
Property. 1922.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I&mdash;'AT HOME' AT OLD JOLYON'S</h3>

<p>Those privileged to be present at a family festival of the
Forsytes have seen that charming and instructive sight&mdash;an
upper middle-class family in full plumage. But whosoever of these
favoured persons has possessed the gift of psychological analysis
(a talent without monetary value and properly ignored by the
Forsytes), has witnessed a spectacle, not only delightful in
itself, but illustrative of an obscure human problem. In plainer
words, he has gleaned from a gathering of this family&mdash;no
branch of which had a liking for the other, between no three
members of whom existed anything worthy of the name of
sympathy&mdash;evidence of that mysterious concrete tenacity which
renders a family so formidable a unit of society, so clear a
reproduction of society in miniature. He has been admitted to a
vision of the dim roads of social progress, has understood
something of patriarchal life, of the swarmings of savage hordes,
of the rise and fall of nations. He is like one who, having watched
a tree grow from its planting&mdash;a paragon of tenacity,
insulation, and success, amidst the deaths of a hundred other
plants less fibrous, sappy, and persistent&mdash;one day will see
it flourishing with bland, full foliage, in an almost repugnant
prosperity, at the summit of its efflorescence.</p>

<p>On June 15, eighteen eighty-six, about four of the afternoon,
the observer who chanced to be present at the house of old Jolyon
Forsyte in Stanhope Gate, might have seen the highest efflorescence
of the Forsytes.</p>

<p>This was the occasion of an 'at home' to celebrate the
engagement of Miss June Forsyte, old Jolyon's granddaughter, to Mr.
Philip Bosinney. In the bravery of light gloves, buff waistcoats,
feathers and frocks, the family were present, even Aunt Ann, who
now but seldom left the corner of her brother Timothy's green
drawing-room, where, under the aegis of a plume of dyed pampas
grass in a light blue vase, she sat all day reading and knitting,
surrounded by the effigies of three generations of Forsytes. Even
Aunt Ann was there; her inflexible back, and the dignity of her
calm old face personifying the rigid possessiveness of the family
idea.</p>

<p>When a Forsyte was engaged, married, or born, the Forsytes were
present; when a Forsyte died&mdash;but no Forsyte had as yet died;
they did not die; death being contrary to their principles, they
took precautions against it, the instinctive precautions of highly
vitalized persons who resent encroachments on their property.</p>

<p>About the Forsytes mingling that day with the crowd of other
guests, there was a more than ordinarily groomed look, an alert,
inquisitive assurance, a brilliant respectability, as though they
were attired in defiance of something. The habitual sniff on the
face of Soames Forsyte had spread through their ranks; they were on
their guard.</p>

<p>The subconscious offensiveness of their attitude has constituted
old Jolyon's 'home' the psychological moment of the family history,
made it the prelude of their drama.</p>

<p>The Forsytes were resentful of something, not individually, but
as a family; this resentment expressed itself in an added
perfection of raiment, an exuberance of family cordiality, an
exaggeration of family importance, and&mdash;the sniff.
Danger&mdash;so indispensable in bringing out the fundamental
quality of any society, group, or individual&mdash;was what the
Forsytes scented; the premonition of danger put a burnish on their
armour. For the first time, as a family, they appeared to have an
instinct of being in contact, with some strange and unsafe
thing.</p>

<p>Over against the piano a man of bulk and stature was wearing two
waistcoats on his wide chest, two waistcoats and a ruby pin,
instead of the single satin waistcoat and diamond pin of more usual
occasions, and his shaven, square, old face, the colour of pale
leather, with pale eyes, had its most dignified look, above his
satin stock. This was Swithin Forsyte. Close to the window, where
he could get more than his fair share of fresh air, the other twin,
James&mdash;the fat and the lean of it, old Jolyon called these
brothers&mdash;like the bulky Swithin, over six feet in height, but
very lean, as though destined from his birth to strike a balance
and maintain an average, brooded over the scene with his permanent
stoop; his grey eyes had an air of fixed absorption in some secret
worry, broken at intervals by a rapid, shifting scrutiny of
surrounding facts; his cheeks, thinned by two parallel folds, and a
long, clean-shaven upper lip, were framed within Dundreary
whiskers. In his hands he turned and turned a piece of china. Not
far off, listening to a lady in brown, his only son Soames, pale
and well-shaved, dark-haired, rather bald, had poked his chin up
sideways, carrying his nose with that aforesaid appearance of
'sniff,' as though despising an egg which he knew he could not
digest. Behind him his cousin, the tall George, son of the fifth
Forsyte, Roger, had a Quilpish look on his fleshy face, pondering
one of his sardonic jests. Something inherent to the occasion had
affected them all.</p>

<p>Seated in a row close to one another were three
ladies&mdash;Aunts Ann, Hester (the two Forsyte maids), and Juley
(short for Julia), who not in first youth had so far forgotten
herself as to marry Septimus Small, a man of poor constitution. She
had survived him for many years. With her elder and younger sister
she lived now in the house of Timothy, her sixth and youngest
brother, on the Bayswater Road. Each of these ladies held fans in
their hands, and each with some touch of colour, some emphatic
feather or brooch, testified to the solemnity of the
opportunity.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room, under the chandelier, as became a
host, stood the head of the family, old Jolyon himself. Eighty
years of age, with his fine, white hair, his dome-like forehead,
his little, dark grey eyes, and an immense white moustache, which
drooped and spread below the level of his strong jaw, he had a
patriarchal look, and in spite of lean cheeks and hollows at his
temples, seemed master of perennial youth. He held himself
extremely upright, and his shrewd, steady eyes had lost none of
their clear shining. Thus he gave an impression of superiority to
the doubts and dislikes of smaller men. Having had his own way for
innumerable years, he had earned a prescriptive right to it. It
would never have occurred to old Jolyon that it was necessary to
wear a look of doubt or of defiance.</p>

<p>Between him and the four other brothers who were present, James,
Swithin, Nicholas, and Roger, there was much difference, much
similarity. In turn, each of these four brothers was very different
from the other, yet they, too, were alike.</p>

<p>Through the varying features and expression of those five faces
could be marked a certain steadfastness of chin, underlying surface
distinctions, marking a racial stamp, too prehistoric to trace, too
remote and permanent to discuss&mdash;the very hall-mark and
guarantee of the family fortunes.</p>

<p>Among the younger generation, in the tall, bull-like George, in
pallid strenuous Archibald, in young Nicholas with his sweet and
tentative obstinacy, in the grave and foppishly determined Eustace,
there was this same stamp&mdash;less meaningful perhaps, but
unmistakable&mdash;a sign of something ineradicable in the family
soul. At one time or another during the afternoon, all these faces,
so dissimilar and so alike, had worn an expression of distrust, the
object of which was undoubtedly the man whose acquaintance they
were thus assembled to make. Philip Bosinney was known to be a
young man without fortune, but Forsyte girls had become engaged to
such before, and had actually married them. It was not altogether
for this reason, therefore, that the minds of the Forsytes misgave
them. They could not have explained the origin of a misgiving
obscured by the mist of family gossip. A story was undoubtedly told
that he had paid his duty call to Aunts Ann, Juley, and Hester, in
a soft grey hat&mdash;a soft grey hat, not even a new one&mdash;a
dusty thing with a shapeless crown. "So, extraordinary, my
dear&mdash;so odd," Aunt Hester, passing through the little, dark
hall (she was rather short-sighted), had tried to 'shoo' it off a
chair, taking it for a strange, disreputable cat&mdash;Tommy had
such disgraceful friends! She was disturbed when it did not
move.</p>

<p>Like an artist for ever seeking to discover the significant
trifle which embodies the whole character of a scene, or place, or
person, so those unconscious artists&mdash;the Forsytes had
fastened by intuition on this hat; it was their significant trifle,
the detail in which was embedded the meaning of the whole matter;
for each had asked himself: "Come, now, should I have paid that
visit in that hat?" and each had answered "No!" and some, with more
imagination than others, had added: "It would never have come into
my head!"</p>

<p>George, on hearing the story, grinned. The hat had obviously
been worn as a practical joke! He himself was a connoisseur of
such. "Very haughty!" he said, "the wild Buccaneer."</p>

<p>And this mot, the 'Buccaneer,' was bandied from mouth to mouth,
till it became the favourite mode of alluding to Bosinney.</p>

<p>Her aunts reproached June afterwards about the hat.</p>

<p>"We don't think you ought to let him, dear!" they had said.</p>

<p>June had answered in her imperious brisk way, like the little
embodiment of will she was: "Oh! what does it matter? Phil never
knows what he's got on!"</p>

<p>No one had credited an answer so outrageous. A man not to know
what he had on? No, no! What indeed was this young man, who, in
becoming engaged to June, old Jolyon's acknowledged heiress, had
done so well for himself? He was an architect, not in itself a
sufficient reason for wearing such a hat. None of the Forsytes
happened to be architects, but one of them knew two architects who
would never have worn such a hat upon a call of ceremony in the
London season.</p>

<p>Dangerous&mdash;ah, dangerous! June, of course, had not seen
this, but, though not yet nineteen, she was notorious. Had she not
said to Mrs. Soames&mdash;who was always so beautifully
dressed&mdash;that feathers were vulgar? Mrs. Soames had actually
given up wearing feathers, so dreadfully downright was dear
June!</p>

<p>These misgivings, this disapproval, and perfectly genuine
distrust, did not prevent the Forsytes from gathering to old
Jolyon's invitation. An 'At Home' at Stanhope Gate was a great
rarity; none had been held for twelve years, not indeed, since old
Mrs. Jolyon had died.</p>

<p>Never had there been so full an assembly, for, mysteriously
united in spite of all their differences, they had taken arms
against a common peril. Like cattle when a dog comes into the
field, they stood head to head and shoulder to shoulder, prepared
to run upon and trample the invader to death. They had come, too,
no doubt, to get some notion of what sort of presents they would
ultimately be expected to give; for though the question of wedding
gifts was usually graduated in this way: 'What are you givin'?
Nicholas is givin' spoons!'&mdash;so very much depended on the
bridegroom. If he were sleek, well-brushed, prosperous-looking, it
was more necessary to give him nice things; he would expect them.
In the end each gave exactly what was right and proper, by a
species of family adjustment arrived at as prices are arrived at on
the Stock Exchange&mdash;the exact niceties being regulated at
Timothy's commodious, red-brick residence in Bayswater, overlooking
the Park, where dwelt Aunts Ann, Juley, and Hester.</p>

<p>The uneasiness of the Forsyte family has been justified by the
simple mention of the hat. How impossible and wrong would it have
been for any family, with the regard for appearances which should
ever characterize the great upper middle-class, to feel otherwise
than uneasy!</p>

<p>The author of the uneasiness stood talking to June by the
further door; his curly hair had a rumpled appearance, as though he
found what was going on around him unusual. He had an air, too, of
having a joke all to himself. George, speaking aside to his
brother, Eustace, said:</p>

<p>"Looks as if he might make a bolt of it&mdash;the dashing
Buccaneer!"</p>

<p>This 'very singular-looking man,' as Mrs. Small afterwards
called him, was of medium height and strong build, with a pale,
brown face, a dust-coloured moustache, very prominent cheek-bones,
and hollow checks. His forehead sloped back towards the crown of
his head, and bulged out in bumps over the eyes, like foreheads
seen in the Lion-house at the Zoo. He had sherry-coloured eyes,
disconcertingly inattentive at times. Old Jolyon's coachman, after
driving June and Bosinney to the theatre, had remarked to the
butler:</p>

<p>"I dunno what to make of 'im. Looks to me for all the world like
an 'alf-tame leopard." And every now and then a Forsyte would come
up, sidle round, and take a look at him.</p>

<p>June stood in front, fending off this idle curiosity&mdash;a
little bit of a thing, as somebody once said, 'all hair and
spirit,' with fearless blue eyes, a firm jaw, and a bright colour,
whose face and body seemed too slender for her crown of red-gold
hair.</p>

<p>A tall woman, with a beautiful figure, which some member of the
family had once compared to a heathen goddess, stood looking at
these two with a shadowy smile.</p>

<p>Her hands, gloved in French grey, were crossed one over the
other, her grave, charming face held to one side, and the eyes of
all men near were fastened on it. Her figure swayed, so balanced
that the very air seemed to set it moving. There was warmth, but
little colour, in her cheeks; her large, dark eyes were soft.</p>

<p>But it was at her lips&mdash;asking a question, giving an
answer, with that shadowy smile&mdash;that men looked; they were
sensitive lips, sensuous and sweet, and through them seemed to come
warmth and perfume like the warmth and perfume of a flower.</p>

<p>The engaged couple thus scrutinized were unconscious of this
passive goddess. It was Bosinney who first noticed her, and asked
her name.</p>

<p>June took her lover up to the woman with the beautiful
figure.</p>

<p>"Irene is my greatest chum," she said: "Please be good friends,
you two!"</p>

<p>At the little lady's command they all three smiled; and while
they were smiling, Soames Forsyte, silently appearing from behind
the woman with the beautiful figure, who was his wife, said:</p>

<p>"Ah! introduce me too!"</p>

<p>He was seldom, indeed, far from Irene's side at public
functions, and even when separated by the exigencies of social
intercourse, could be seen following her about with his eyes, in
which were strange expressions of watchfulness and longing.</p>

<p>At the window his father, James, was still scrutinizing the
marks on the piece of china.</p>

<p>"I wonder at Jolyon's allowing this engagement," he said to Aunt
Ann. "They tell me there's no chance of their getting married for
years. This young Bosinney" (he made the word a dactyl in
opposition to general usage of a short o) "has got nothing. When
Winifred married Dartie, I made him bring every penny into
settlement&mdash;lucky thing, too&mdash;they'd ha' had nothing by
this time!"</p>

<p>Aunt Ann looked up from her velvet chair. Grey curls banded her
forehead, curls that, unchanged for decades, had extinguished in
the family all sense of time. She made no reply, for she rarely
spoke, husbanding her aged voice; but to James, uneasy of
conscience, her look was as good as an answer.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I couldn't help Irene's having no money.
Soames was in such a hurry; he got quite thin dancing attendance on
her."</p>

<p>Putting the bowl pettishly down on the piano, he let his eyes
wander to the group by the door.</p>

<p>"It's my opinion," he said unexpectedly, "that it's just as well
as it is."</p>

<p>Aunt Ann did not ask him to explain this strange utterance. She
knew what he was thinking. If Irene had no money she would not be
so foolish as to do anything wrong; for they said&mdash;they
said&mdash;she had been asking for a separate room; but, of course,
Soames had not...</p>

<p>James interrupted her reverie:</p>

<p>"But where," he asked, "was Timothy? Hadn't he come with
them?"</p>

<p>Through Aunt Ann's compressed lips a tender smile forced its
way:</p>

<p>"No, he didn't think it wise, with so much of this diphtheria
about; and he so liable to take things."</p>

<p>James answered:</p>

<p>"Well, HE takes good care of himself. I can't afford to take the
care of myself that he does."</p>

<p>Nor was it easy to say which, of admiration, envy, or contempt,
was dominant in that remark.</p>

<p>Timothy, indeed, was seldom seen. The baby of the family, a
publisher by profession, he had some years before, when business
was at full tide, scented out the stagnation which, indeed, had not
yet come, but which ultimately, as all agreed, was bound to set in,
and, selling his share in a firm engaged mainly in the production
of religious books, had invested the quite conspicuous proceeds in
three per cent. consols. By this act he had at once assumed an
isolated position, no other Forsyte being content with less than
four per cent. for his money; and this isolation had slowly and
surely undermined a spirit perhaps better than commonly endowed
with caution. He had become almost a myth&mdash;a kind of
incarnation of security haunting the background of the Forsyte
universe. He had never committed the imprudence of marrying, or
encumbering himself in any way with children.</p>

<p>James resumed, tapping the piece of china:</p>

<p>"This isn't real old Worcester. I s'pose Jolyon's told you
something about the young man. From all I can learn, he's got no
business, no income, and no connection worth speaking of; but then,
I know nothing&mdash;nobody tells me anything."</p>

<p>Aunt Ann shook her head. Over her square-chinned, aquiline old
face a trembling passed; the spidery fingers of her hands pressed
against each other and interlaced, as though she were subtly
recharging her will.</p>

<p>The eldest by some years of all the Forsytes, she held a
peculiar position amongst them. Opportunists and egotists one and
all&mdash;though not, indeed, more so than their
neighbours&mdash;they quailed before her incorruptible figure, and,
when opportunities were too strong, what could they do but avoid
her!</p>

<p>Twisting his long, thin legs, James went on:</p>

<p>"Jolyon, he will have his own way. He's got no
children"&mdash;and stopped, recollecting the continued existence
of old Jolyon's son, young Jolyon, June's father, who had made such
a mess of it, and done for himself by deserting his wife and child
and running away with that foreign governess. "Well," he resumed
hastily, "if he likes to do these things, I s'pose he can afford
to. Now, what's he going to give her? I s'pose he'll give her a
thousand a year; he's got nobody else to leave his money to."</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand to meet that of a dapper, clean-shaven
man, with hardly a hair on his head, a long, broken nose, full
lips, and cold grey eyes under rectangular brows.</p>

<p>"Well, Nick," he muttered, "how are you?"</p>

<p>Nicholas Forsyte, with his bird-like rapidity and the look of a
preternaturally sage schoolboy (he had made a large fortune, quite
legitimately, out of the companies of which he was a director),
placed within that cold palm the tips of his still colder fingers
and hastily withdrew them.</p>

<p>"I'm bad," he said, pouting&mdash;"been bad all the week; don't
sleep at night. The doctor can't tell why. He's a clever fellow, or
I shouldn't have him, but I get nothing out of him but bills."</p>

<p>"Doctors!" said James, coming down sharp on his words: "I've had
all the doctors in London for one or another of us. There's no
satisfaction to be got out of them; they'll tell you anything.
There's Swithin, now. What good have they done him? There he is;
he's bigger than ever; he's enormous; they can't get his weight
down. Look at him!"</p>

<p>Swithin Forsyte, tall, square, and broad, with a chest like a
pouter pigeon's in its plumage of bright waistcoats, came strutting
towards them.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;how are you?" he said in his dandified way, aspirating
the 'h' strongly (this difficult letter was almost absolutely safe
in his keeping)&mdash;"how are you?"</p>

<p>Each brother wore an air of aggravation as he looked at the
other two, knowing by experience that they would try to eclipse his
ailments.</p>

<p>"We were just saying," said James, "that you don't get any
thinner."</p>

<p>Swithin protruded his pale round eyes with the effort of
hearing.</p>

<p>"Thinner? I'm in good case," he said, leaning a little forward,
"not one of your thread-papers like you!"</p>

<p>But, afraid of losing the expansion of his chest, he leaned back
again into a state of immobility, for he prized nothing so highly
as a distinguished appearance.</p>

<p>Aunt Ann turned her old eyes from one to the other. Indulgent
and severe was her look. In turn the three brothers looked at Ann.
She was getting shaky. Wonderful woman! Eighty-six if a day; might
live another ten years, and had never been strong. Swithin and
James, the twins, were only seventy-five, Nicholas a mere baby of
seventy or so. All were strong, and the inference was comforting.
Of all forms of property their respective healths naturally
concerned them most.</p>

<p>"I'm very well in myself," proceeded James, "but my nerves are
out of order. The least thing worries me to death. I shall have to
go to Bath."</p>

<p>"Bath!" said Nicholas. "I've tried Harrogate. That's no good.
What I want is sea air. There's nothing like Yarmouth. Now, when I
go there I sleep..."</p>

<p>"My liver's very bad," interrupted Swithin slowly. "Dreadful
pain here;" and he placed his hand on his right side.</p>

<p>"Want of exercise," muttered James, his eyes on the china. He
quickly added: "I get a pain there, too."</p>

<p>Swithin reddened, a resemblance to a turkey-cock coming upon his
old face.</p>

<p>"Exercise!" he said. "I take plenty: I never use the lift at the
Club."</p>

<p>"I didn't know," James hurried out. "I know nothing about
anybody; nobody tells me anything..."</p>

<p>Swithin fixed him with a stare:</p>

<p>"What do you do for a pain there?"</p>

<p>James brightened.</p>

<p>"I take a compound..."</p>

<p>"How are you, uncle?"</p>

<p>June stood before him, her resolute small face raised from her
little height to his great height, and her hand outheld.</p>

<p>The brightness faded from James's visage.</p>

<p>"How are you?" he said, brooding over her. "So you're going to
Wales to-morrow to visit your young man's aunts? You'll have a lot
of rain there. This isn't real old Worcester." He tapped the bowl.
"Now, that set I gave your mother when she married was the genuine
thing."</p>

<p>June shook hands one by one with her three great-uncles, and
turned to Aunt Ann. A very sweet look had come into the old lady's
face, she kissed the girl's check with trembling fervour.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," she said, "and so you're going for a whole
month!"</p>

<p>The girl passed on, and Aunt Ann looked after her slim little
figure. The old lady's round, steel grey eyes, over which a film
like a bird's was beginning to come, followed her wistfully amongst
the bustling crowd, for people were beginning to say good-bye; and
her finger-tips, pressing and pressing against each other, were
busy again with the recharging of her will against that inevitable
ultimate departure of her own.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she thought, 'everybody's been most kind; quite a lot of
people come to congratulate her. She ought to be very happy.'
Amongst the throng of people by the door, the well-dressed throng
drawn from the families of lawyers and doctors, from the Stock
Exchange, and all the innumerable avocations of the upper-middle
class&mdash;there were only some twenty percent of Forsytes; but to
Aunt Ann they seemed all Forsytes&mdash;and certainly there was not
much difference&mdash;she saw only her own flesh and blood. It was
her world, this family, and she knew no other, had never perhaps
known any other. All their little secrets, illnesses, engagements,
and marriages, how they were getting on, and whether they were
making money&mdash;all this was her property, her delight, her
life; beyond this only a vague, shadowy mist of facts and persons
of no real significance. This it was that she would have to lay
down when it came to her turn to die; this which gave to her that
importance, that secret self-importance, without which none of us
can bear to live; and to this she clung wistfully, with a greed
that grew each day! If life were slipping away from her, this she
would retain to the end.</p>

<p>She thought of June's father, young Jolyon, who had run away
with that foreign girl. And what a sad blow to his father and to
them all. Such a promising young fellow! A sad blow, though there
had been no public scandal, most fortunately, Jo's wife seeking for
no divorce! A long time ago! And when June's mother died, six years
ago, Jo had married that woman, and they had two children now, so
she had heard. Still, he had forfeited his right to be there, had
cheated her of the complete fulfilment of her family pride,
deprived her of the rightful pleasure of seeing and kissing him of
whom she had been so proud, such a promising young fellow! The
thought rankled with the bitterness of a long-inflicted injury in
her tenacious old heart. A little water stood in her eyes. With a
handkerchief of the finest lawn she wiped them stealthily.</p>

<p>"Well, Aunt Ann?" said a voice behind.</p>

<p>Soames Forsyte, flat-shouldered, clean-shaven, flat-cheeked,
flat-waisted, yet with something round and secret about his whole
appearance, looked downwards and aslant at Aunt Ann, as though
trying to see through the side of his own nose.</p>

<p>"And what do you think of the engagement?" he asked.</p>

<p>Aunt Ann's eyes rested on him proudly; of all the nephews since
young Jolyon's departure from the family nest, he was now her
favourite, for she recognised in him a sure trustee of the family
soul that must so soon slip beyond her keeping.</p>

<p>"Very nice for the young man," she said; "and he's a
good-looking young fellow; but I doubt if he's quite the right
lover for dear June."</p>

<p>Soames touched the edge of a gold-lacquered lustre.</p>

<p>"She'll tame him," he said, stealthily wetting his finger and
rubbing it on the knobby bulbs. "That's genuine old lacquer; you
can't get it nowadays. It'd do well in a sale at Jobson's." He
spoke with relish, as though he felt that he was cheering up his
old aunt. It was seldom he was so confidential. "I wouldn't mind
having it myself," he added; "you can always get your price for old
lacquer."</p>

<p>"You're so clever with all those things," said Aunt Ann. "And
how is dear Irene?"</p>

<p>Soames's smile died.</p>

<p>"Pretty well," he said. "Complains she can't sleep; she sleeps a
great deal better than I do," and he looked at his wife, who was
talking to Bosinney by the door.</p>

<p>Aunt Ann sighed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, "it will be just as well for her not to see
so much of June. She's such a decided character, dear June!"</p>

<p>Soames flushed; his flushes passed rapidly over his flat cheeks
and centered between his eyes, where they remained, the stamp of
disturbing thoughts.</p>

<p>"I don't know what she sees in that little flibbertigibbet," he
burst out, but noticing that they were no longer alone, he turned
and again began examining the lustre.</p>

<p>"They tell me Jolyon's bought another house," said his father's
voice close by; "he must have a lot of money&mdash;he must have
more money than he knows what to do with! Montpellier Square, they
say; close to Soames! They never told me, Irene never tells me
anything!"</p>

<p>"Capital position, not two minutes from me," said the voice of
Swithin, "and from my rooms I can drive to the Club in eight."</p>

<p>The position of their houses was of vital importance to the
Forsytes, nor was this remarkable, since the whole spirit of their
success was embodied therein.</p>

<p>Their father, of farming stock, had come from Dorsetshire near
the beginning of the century.</p>

<p>'Superior Dosset Forsyte, as he was called by his intimates, had
been a stonemason by trade, and risen to the position of a
master-builder.</p>

<p>Towards the end of his life he moved to London, where, building
on until he died, he was buried at Highgate. He left over thirty
thousand pounds between his ten children. Old Jolyon alluded to
him, if at all, as 'A hard, thick sort of man; not much refinement
about him.' The second generation of Forsytes felt indeed that he
was not greatly to their credit. The only aristocratic trait they
could find in his character was a habit of drinking Madeira.</p>

<p>Aunt Hester, an authority on family history, described him thus:
"I don't recollect that he ever did anything; at least, not in my
time. He was er&mdash;an owner of houses, my dear. His hair about
your Uncle Swithin's colour; rather a square build. Tall?
No&mdash;not very tall" (he had been five feet five, with a mottled
face); "a fresh-coloured man. I remember he used to drink Madeira;
but ask your Aunt Ann. What was his father? He&mdash;er&mdash;had
to do with the land down in Dorsetshire, by the sea."</p>

<p>James once went down to see for himself what sort of place this
was that they had come from. He found two old farms, with a cart
track rutted into the pink earth, leading down to a mill by the
beach; a little grey church with a buttressed outer wall, and a
smaller and greyer chapel. The stream which worked the mill came
bubbling down in a dozen rivulets, and pigs were hunting round that
estuary. A haze hovered over the prospect. Down this hollow, with
their feet deep in the mud and their faces towards the sea, it
appeared that the primeval Forsytes had been content to walk Sunday
after Sunday for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>Whether or no James had cherished hopes of an inheritance, or of
something rather distinguished to be found down there, he came back
to town in a poor way, and went about with a pathetic attempt at
making the best of a bad job.</p>

<p>"There's very little to be had out of that," he said; "regular
country little place, old as the hills..."</p>

<p>Its age was felt to be a comfort. Old Jolyon, in whom a
desperate honesty welled up at times, would allude to his ancestors
as: "Yeomen&mdash;I suppose very small beer." Yet he would repeat
the word 'yeomen' as if it afforded him consolation.</p>

<p>They had all done so well for themselves, these Forsytes, that
they were all what is called 'of a certain position.' They had
shares in all sorts of things, not as yet&mdash;with the exception
of Timothy&mdash;in consols, for they had no dread in life like
that of 3 per cent. for their money. They collected pictures, too,
and were supporters of such charitable institutions as might be
beneficial to their sick domestics. From their father, the builder,
they inherited a talent for bricks and mortar. Originally, perhaps,
members of some primitive sect, they were now in the natural course
of things members of the Church of England, and caused their wives
and children to attend with some regularity the more fashionable
churches of the Metropolis. To have doubted their Christianity
would have caused them both pain and surprise. Some of them paid
for pews, thus expressing in the most practical form their sympathy
with the teachings of Christ.</p>

<p>Their residences, placed at stated intervals round the park,
watched like sentinels, lest the fair heart of this London, where
their desires were fixed, should slip from their clutches, and
leave them lower in their own estimations.</p>

<p>There was old Jolyon in Stanhope Place; the Jameses in Park
Lane; Swithin in the lonely glory of orange and blue chambers in
Hyde Park Mansions&mdash;he had never married, not he&mdash;the
Soamses in their nest off Knightsbridge; the Rogers in Prince's
Gardens (Roger was that remarkable Forsyte who had conceived and
carried out the notion of bringing up his four sons to a new
profession. "Collect house property, nothing like it," he would
say; "I never did anything else").</p>

<p>The Haymans again&mdash;Mrs. Hayman was the one married Forsyte
sister&mdash;in a house high up on Campden Hill, shaped like a
giraffe, and so tall that it gave the observer a crick in the neck;
the Nicholases in Ladbroke Grove, a spacious abode and a great
bargain; and last, but not least, Timothy's on the Bayswater Road,
where Ann, and Juley, and Hester, lived under his protection.</p>

<p>But all this time James was musing, and now he inquired of his
host and brother what he had given for that house in Montpellier
Square. He himself had had his eye on a house there for the last
two years, but they wanted such a price.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon recounted the details of his purchase.</p>

<p>"Twenty-two years to run?" repeated James; "The very house I was
after&mdash;you've given too much for it!"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon frowned.</p>

<p>"It's not that I want it," said James hastily; "it wouldn't suit
my purpose at that price. Soames knows the house, well&mdash;he'll
tell you it's too dear&mdash;his opinion's worth having."</p>

<p>"I don't," said old Jolyon, "care a fig for his opinion."</p>

<p>"Well," murmured James, "you will have your own way&mdash;it's a
good opinion. Good-bye! We're going to drive down to Hurlingham.
They tell me June's going to Wales. You'll be lonely tomorrow.
What'll you do with yourself? You'd better come and dine with
us!"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon refused. He went down to the front door and saw them
into their barouche, and twinkled at them, having already forgotten
his spleen&mdash;Mrs. James facing the horses, tall and majestic
with auburn hair; on her left, Irene&mdash;the two husbands, father
and son, sitting forward, as though they expected something,
opposite their wives. Bobbing and bounding upon the spring
cushions, silent, swaying to each motion of their chariot, old
Jolyon watched them drive away under the sunlight.</p>

<p>During the drive the silence was broken by Mrs. James.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such a collection of rumty-too people?"</p>

<p>Soames, glancing at her beneath his eyelids, nodded, and he saw
Irene steal at him one of her unfathomable looks. It is likely
enough that each branch of the Forsyte family made that remark as
they drove away from old Jolyon's 'At Home!'</p>

<p>Amongst the last of the departing guests the fourth and fifth
brothers, Nicholas and Roger, walked away together, directing their
steps alongside Hyde Park towards the Praed Street Station of the
Underground. Like all other Forsytes of a certain age they kept
carriages of their own, and never took cabs if by any means they
could avoid it.</p>

<p>The day was bright, the trees of the Park in the full beauty of
mid-June foliage; the brothers did not seem to notice phenomena,
which contributed, nevertheless, to the jauntiness of promenade and
conversation.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Roger, "she's a good-lookin' woman, that wife of
Soames's. I'm told they don't get on."</p>

<p>This brother had a high forehead, and the freshest colour of any
of the Forsytes; his light grey eyes measured the street frontage
of the houses by the way, and now and then he would level his,
umbrella and take a 'lunar,' as he expressed it, of the varying
heights.</p>

<p>"She'd no money," replied Nicholas.</p>

<p>He himself had married a good deal of money, of which, it being
then the golden age before the Married Women's Property Act, he had
mercifully been enabled to make a successful use.</p>

<p>"What was her father?"</p>

<p>"Heron was his name, a Professor, so they tell me."</p>

<p>Roger shook his head.</p>

<p>"There's no money in that," he said.</p>

<p>"They say her mother's father was cement."</p>

<p>Roger's face brightened.</p>

<p>"But he went bankrupt," went on Nicholas.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Roger, "Soames will have trouble with her; you
mark my words, he'll have trouble&mdash;she's got a foreign
look."</p>

<p>Nicholas licked his lips.</p>

<p>"She's a pretty woman," and he waved aside a
crossing-sweeper.</p>

<p>"How did he get hold of her?" asked Roger presently. "She must
cost him a pretty penny in dress!"</p>

<p>"Ann tells me," replied Nicholas, "he was half-cracked about
her. She refused him five times. James, he's nervous about it, I
can see."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Roger again; "I'm sorry for James; he had trouble
with Dartie." His pleasant colour was heightened by exercise, he
swung his umbrella to the level of his eye more frequently than
ever. Nicholas's face also wore a pleasant look.</p>

<p>"Too pale for me," he said, "but her figures capital!"</p>

<p>Roger made no reply.</p>

<p>"I call her distinguished-looking," he said at last&mdash;it was
the highest praise in the Forsyte vocabulary. "That young Bosinney
will never do any good for himself. They say at Burkitt's he's one
of these artistic chaps&mdash;got an idea of improving English
architecture; there's no money in that! I should like to hear what
Timothy would say to it."</p>

<p>They entered the station.</p>

<p>"What class are you going? I go second."</p>

<p>"No second for me," said Nicholas;&mdash;"you never know what
you may catch."</p>

<p>He took a first-class ticket to Notting Hill Gate; Roger a
second to South Kensington. The train coming in a minute later, the
two brothers parted and entered their respective compartments. Each
felt aggrieved that the other had not modified his habits to secure
his society a little longer; but as Roger voiced it in his
thoughts:</p>

<p>'Always a stubborn beggar, Nick!'</p>

<p>And as Nicholas expressed it to himself:</p>

<p>'Cantankerous chap Roger&mdash;always was!'</p>

<p>There was little sentimentality about the Forsytes. In that
great London, which they had conquered and become merged in, what
time had they to be sentimental?</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER II&mdash;OLD JOLYON GOES TO THE OPERA</h3>

<p>At five o'clock the following day old Jolyon sat alone, a cigar
between his lips, and on a table by his side a cup of tea. He was
tired, and before he had finished his cigar he fell asleep. A fly
settled on his hair, his breathing sounded heavy in the drowsy
silence, his upper lip under the white moustache puffed in and out.
From between the fingers of his veined and wrinkled hand the cigar,
dropping on the empty hearth, burned itself out.</p>

<p>The gloomy little study, with windows of stained glass to
exclude the view, was full of dark green velvet and heavily-carved
mahogany&mdash;a suite of which old Jolyon was wont to say:
'Shouldn't wonder if it made a big price some day!'</p>

<p>It was pleasant to think that in the after life he could get
more for things than he had given.</p>

<p>In the rich brown atmosphere peculiar to back rooms in the
mansion of a Forsyte, the Rembrandtesque effect of his great head,
with its white hair, against the cushion of his high-backed seat,
was spoiled by the moustache, which imparted a somewhat military
look to his face. An old clock that had been with him since before
his marriage forty years ago kept with its ticking a jealous record
of the seconds slipping away forever from its old master.</p>

<p>He had never cared for this room, hardly going into it from one
year's end to another, except to take cigars from the Japanese
cabinet in the corner, and the room now had its revenge.</p>

<p>His temples, curving like thatches over the hollows beneath, his
cheek-bones and chin, all were sharpened in his sleep, and there
had come upon his face the confession that he was an old man.</p>

<p>He woke. June had gone! James had said he would be lonely. James
had always been a poor thing. He recollected with satisfaction that
he had bought that house over James's head.</p>

<p>Serve him right for sticking at the price; the only thing the
fellow thought of was money. Had he given too much, though? It
wanted a lot of doing to&mdash;He dared say he would want all his
money before he had done with this affair of June's. He ought never
to have allowed the engagement. She had met this Bosinney at the
house of Baynes, Baynes and Bildeboy, the architects. He believed
that Baynes, whom he knew&mdash;a bit of an old woman&mdash;was the
young man's uncle by marriage. After that she'd been always running
after him; and when she took a thing into her head there was no
stopping her. She was continually taking up with 'lame ducks' of
one sort or another. This fellow had no money, but she must needs
become engaged to him&mdash;a harumscarum, unpractical chap, who
would get himself into no end of difficulties.</p>

<p>She had come to him one day in her slap-dash way and told him;
and, as if it were any consolation, she had added:</p>

<p>"He's so splendid; he's often lived on cocoa for a week!"</p>

<p>"And he wants you to live on cocoa too?"</p>

<p>"Oh no; he is getting into the swim now."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon had taken his cigar from under his white moustaches,
stained by coffee at the edge, and looked at her, that little slip
of a thing who had got such a grip of his heart. He knew more about
'swims' than his granddaughter. But she, having clasped her hands
on his knees, rubbed her chin against him, making a sound like a
purring cat. And, knocking the ash off his cigar, he had exploded
in nervous desperation:</p>

<p>"You're all alike: you won't be satisfied till you've got what
you want. If you must come to grief, you must; I wash my hands of
it."</p>

<p>So, he had washed his hands of it, making the condition that
they should not marry until Bosinney had at least four hundred a
year.</p>

<p>"I shan't be able to give you very much," he had said, a formula
to which June was not unaccustomed. "Perhaps this What's-his-name
will provide the cocoa."</p>

<p>He had hardly seen anything of her since it began. A bad
business! He had no notion of giving her a lot of money to enable a
fellow he knew nothing about to live on in idleness. He had seen
that sort of thing before; no good ever came of it. Worst of all,
he had no hope of shaking her resolution; she was as obstinate as a
mule, always had been from a child. He didn't see where it was to
end. They must cut their coat according to their cloth. He would
not give way till he saw young Bosinney with an income of his own.
That June would have trouble with the fellow was as plain as a
pikestaff; he had no more idea of money than a cow. As to this
rushing down to Wales to visit the young man's aunts, he fully
expected they were old cats.</p>

<p>And, motionless, old Jolyon stared at the wall; but for his open
eyes, he might have been asleep...The idea of supposing that young
cub Soames could give him advice! He had always been a cub, with
his nose in the air! He would be setting up as a man of property
next, with a place in the country! A man of property! H'mph! Like
his father, he was always nosing out bargains, a cold-blooded young
beggar!</p>

<p>He rose, and, going to the cabinet, began methodically stocking
his cigar-case from a bundle fresh in. They were not bad at the
price, but you couldn't get a good cigar, nowadays, nothing to hold
a candle to those old Superfinos of Hanson and Bridger's. That was
a cigar!</p>

<p>The thought, like some stealing perfume, carried him back to
those wonderful nights at Richmond when after dinner he sat smoking
on the terrace of the Crown and Sceptre with Nicholas Treffry and
Traquair and Jack Herring and Anthony Thornworthy. How good his
cigars were then! Poor old Nick!&mdash;dead, and Jack
Herring&mdash;dead, and Traquair&mdash;dead of that wife of his,
and Thornworthy&mdash;awfully shaky (no wonder, with his
appetite).</p>

<p>Of all the company of those days he himself alone seemed left,
except Swithin, of course, and he so outrageously big there was no
doing anything with him.</p>

<p>Difficult to believe it was so long ago; he felt young still! Of
all his thoughts, as he stood there counting his cigars, this was
the most poignant, the most bitter. With his white head and his
loneliness he had remained young and green at heart. And those
Sunday afternoons on Hampstead Heath, when young Jolyon and he went
for a stretch along the Spaniard's Road to Highgate, to Child's
Hill, and back over the Heath again to dine at Jack Straw's
Castle&mdash;how delicious his cigars were then! And such weather!
There was no weather now.</p>

<p>When June was a toddler of five, and every other Sunday he took
her to the Zoo, away from the society of those two good women, her
mother and her grandmother, and at the top of the bear den baited
his umbrella with buns for her favourite bears, how sweet his
cigars were then!</p>

<p>Cigars! He had not even succeeded in out-living his
palate&mdash;the famous palate that in the fifties men swore by,
and speaking of him, said: "Forsyte's the best palate in London!"
The palate that in a sense had made his fortune&mdash;the fortune
of the celebrated tea men, Forsyte and Treffry, whose tea, like no
other man's tea, had a romantic aroma, the charm of a quite
singular genuineness. About the house of Forsyte and Treffry in the
City had clung an air of enterprise and mystery, of special
dealings in special ships, at special ports, with special
Orientals.</p>

<p>He had worked at that business! Men did work in those days!
these young pups hardly knew the meaning of the word. He had gone
into every detail, known everything that went on, sometimes sat up
all night over it. And he had always chosen his agents himself,
prided himself on it. His eye for men, he used to say, had been the
secret of his success, and the exercise of this masterful power of
selection had been the only part of it all that he had really
liked. Not a career for a man of his ability. Even now, when the
business had been turned into a Limited Liability Company, and was
declining (he had got out of his shares long ago), he felt a sharp
chagrin in thinking of that time. How much better he might have
done! He would have succeeded splendidly at the Bar! He had even
thought of standing for Parliament. How often had not Nicholas
Treffry said to him:</p>

<p>"You could do anything, Jo, if you weren't so d-damned careful
of yourself!" Dear old Nick! Such a good fellow, but a racketty
chap! The notorious Treffry! He had never taken any care of
himself. So he was dead. Old Jolyon counted his cigars with a
steady hand, and it came into his mind to wonder if perhaps he had
been too careful of himself.</p>

<p>He put the cigar-case in the breast of his coat, buttoned it in,
and walked up the long flights to his bedroom, leaning on one foot
and the other, and helping himself by the bannister. The house was
too big. After June was married, if she ever did marry this fellow,
as he supposed she would, he would let it and go into rooms. What
was the use of keeping half a dozen servants eating their heads
off?</p>

<p>The butler came to the ring of his bell&mdash;a large man with a
beard, a soft tread, and a peculiar capacity for silence. Old
Jolyon told him to put his dress clothes out; he was going to dine
at the Club.</p>

<p>How long had the carriage been back from taking Miss June to the
station? Since two? Then let him come round at half-past six!</p>

<p>The Club which old Jolyon entered on the stroke of seven was one
of those political institutions of the upper middle class which
have seen better days. In spite of being talked about, perhaps in
consequence of being talked about, it betrayed a disappointing
vitality. People had grown tired of saying that the 'Disunion' was
on its last legs. Old Jolyon would say it, too, yet disregarded the
fact in a manner truly irritating to well-constituted Clubmen.</p>

<p>"Why do you keep your name on?" Swithin often asked him with
profound vexation. "Why don't you join the 'Polyglot'? You can't
get a wine like our Heidsieck under twenty shillin' a bottle
anywhere in London;" and, dropping his voice, he added: "There's
only five hundred dozen left. I drink it every night of my
life."</p>

<p>"I'll think of it," old Jolyon would answer; but when he did
think of it there was always the question of fifty guineas entrance
fee, and it would take him four or five years to get in. He
continued to think of it.</p>

<p>He was too old to be a Liberal, had long ceased to believe in
the political doctrines of his Club, had even been known to allude
to them as 'wretched stuff,' and it afforded him pleasure to
continue a member in the teeth of principles so opposed to his own.
He had always had a contempt for the place, having joined it many
years ago when they refused to have him at the 'Hotch Potch' owing
to his being 'in trade.' As if he were not as good as any of them!
He naturally despised the Club that did take him. The members were
a poor lot, many of them in the City&mdash;stockbrokers,
solicitors, auctioneers&mdash;what not! Like most men of strong
character but not too much originality, old Jolyon set small store
by the class to which he belonged. Faithfully he followed their
customs, social and otherwise, and secretly he thought them 'a
common lot.'</p>

<p>Years and philosophy, of which he had his share, had dimmed the
recollection of his defeat at the 'Hotch Potch'; and now in his
thoughts it was enshrined as the Queen of Clubs. He would have been
a member all these years himself, but, owing to the slipshod way
his proposer, Jack Herring, had gone to work, they had not known
what they were doing in keeping him out. Why! they had taken his
son Jo at once, and he believed the boy was still a member; he had
received a letter dated from there eight years ago.</p>

<p>He had not been near the 'Disunion' for months, and the house
had undergone the piebald decoration which people bestow on old
houses and old ships when anxious to sell them.</p>

<p>'Beastly colour, the smoking-room!' he thought. 'The dining-room
is good!'</p>

<p>Its gloomy chocolate, picked out with light green, took his
fancy.</p>

<p>He ordered dinner, and sat down in the very corner, at the very
table perhaps! (things did not progress much at the 'Disunion,' a
Club of almost Radical principles) at which he and young Jolyon
used to sit twenty-five years ago, when he was taking the latter to
Drury Lane, during his holidays.</p>

<p>The boy had loved the theatre, and old Jolyon recalled how he
used to sit opposite, concealing his excitement under a careful but
transparent nonchalance.</p>

<p>He ordered himself, too, the very dinner the boy had always
chosen-soup, whitebait, cutlets, and a tart. Ah! if he were only
opposite now!</p>

<p>The two had not met for fourteen years. And not for the first
time during those fourteen years old Jolyon wondered whether he had
been a little to blame in the matter of his son. An unfortunate
love-affair with that precious flirt Danae Thornworthy (now Danae
Pellew), Anthony Thornworthy's daughter, had thrown him on the
rebound into the arms of June's mother. He ought perhaps to have
put a spoke in the wheel of their marriage; they were too young;
but after that experience of Jo's susceptibility he had been only
too anxious to see him married. And in four years the crash had
come! To have approved his son's conduct in that crash was, of
course, impossible; reason and training&mdash;that combination of
potent factors which stood for his principles&mdash;told him of
this impossibility, and his heart cried out. The grim
remorselessness of that business had no pity for hearts. There was
June, the atom with flaming hair, who had climbed all over him,
twined and twisted herself about him&mdash;about his heart that was
made to be the plaything and beloved resort of tiny, helpless
things. With characteristic insight he saw he must part with one or
with the other; no half-measures could serve in such a situation.
In that lay its tragedy. And the tiny, helpless thing prevailed. He
would not run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, and so to his
son he said good-bye.</p>

<p>That good-bye had lasted until now.</p>

<p>He had proposed to continue a reduced allowance to young Jolyon,
but this had been refused, and perhaps that refusal had hurt him
more than anything, for with it had gone the last outlet of his
penned-in affection; and there had come such tangible and solid
proof of rupture as only a transaction in property, a bestowal or
refusal of such, could supply.</p>

<p>His dinner tasted flat. His pint of champagne was dry and bitter
stuff, not like the Veuve Clicquots of old days.</p>

<p>Over his cup of coffee, he bethought him that he would go to the
opera. In the Times, therefore&mdash;he had a distrust of other
papers&mdash;he read the announcement for the evening. It was
'Fidelio.'</p>

<p>Mercifully not one of those new-fangled German pantomimes by
that fellow Wagner.</p>

<p>Putting on his ancient opera hat, which, with its brim flattened
by use, and huge capacity, looked like an emblem of greater days,
and, pulling out an old pair of very thin lavender kid gloves
smelling strongly of Russia leather, from habitual proximity to the
cigar-case in the pocket of his overcoat, he stepped into a
hansom.</p>

<p>The cab rattled gaily along the streets, and old Jolyon was
struck by their unwonted animation.</p>

<p>'The hotels must be doing a tremendous business,' he thought. A
few years ago there had been none of these big hotels. He made a
satisfactory reflection on some property he had in the
neighbourhood. It must be going up in value by leaps and bounds!
What traffic!</p>

<p>But from that he began indulging in one of those strange
impersonal speculations, so uncharacteristic of a Forsyte, wherein
lay, in part, the secret of his supremacy amongst them. What atoms
men were, and what a lot of them! And what would become of them
all?</p>

<p>He stumbled as he got out of the cab, gave the man his exact
fare, walked up to the ticket office to take his stall, and stood
there with his purse in his hand&mdash;he always carried his money
in a purse, never having approved of that habit of carrying it
loosely in the pockets, as so many young men did nowadays. The
official leaned out, like an old dog from a kennel.</p>

<p>"Why," he said in a surprised voice, "it's Mr. Jolyon Forsyte!
So it is! Haven't seen you, sir, for years. Dear me! Times aren't
what they were. Why! you and your brother, and that
auctioneer&mdash;Mr. Traquair, and Mr. Nicholas Treffry&mdash;you
used to have six or seven stalls here regular every season. And how
are you, sir? We don't get younger!"</p>

<p>The colour in old Jolyon's eyes deepened; he paid his guinea.
They had not forgotten him. He marched in, to the sounds of the
overture, like an old war-horse to battle.</p>

<p>Folding his opera hat, he sat down, drew out his lavender gloves
in the old way, and took up his glasses for a long look round the
house. Dropping them at last on his folded hat, he fixed his eyes
on the curtain. More poignantly than ever he felt that it was all
over and done with him. Where were all the women, the pretty women,
the house used to be so full of? Where was that old feeling in the
heart as he waited for one of those great singers? Where that
sensation of the intoxication of life and of his own power to enjoy
it all?</p>

<p>The greatest opera-goer of his day! There was no opera now! That
fellow Wagner had ruined everything; no melody left, nor any voices
to sing it. Ah! the wonderful singers! Gone! He sat watching the
old scenes acted, a numb feeling at his heart.</p>

<p>From the curl of silver over his ear to the pose of his foot in
its elastic-sided patent boot, there was nothing clumsy or weak
about old Jolyon. He was as upright&mdash;very nearly&mdash;as in
those old times when he came every night; his sight was as
good&mdash;almost as good. But what a feeling of weariness and
disillusion!</p>

<p>He had been in the habit all his life of enjoying things, even
imperfect things&mdash;and there had been many imperfect
things&mdash;he had enjoyed them all with moderation, so as to keep
himself young. But now he was deserted by his power of enjoyment,
by his philosophy, and left with this dreadful feeling that it was
all done with. Not even the Prisoners' Chorus, nor Florian's Song,
had the power to dispel the gloom of his loneliness.</p>

<p>If Jo were only with him! The boy must be forty by now. He had
wasted fourteen years out of the life of his only son. And Jo was
no longer a social pariah. He was married. Old Jolyon had been
unable to refrain from marking his appreciation of the action by
enclosing his son a cheque for L500. The cheque had been returned
in a letter from the 'Hotch Potch,' couched in these words.</p>

<blockquote>'MY DEAREST FATHER,<br>
<br>
'Your generous gift was welcome as a sign that you might think
worse of me. I return it, but should you think fit to invest it for
the benefit of the little chap (we call him Jolly), who bears our
Christian and, by courtesy, our surname, I shall be very glad.<br>
<br>
'I hope with all my heart that your health is as good as ever.<br>
<br>
'Your loving son,<br>
<br>
'Jo.'</blockquote>

<p>The letter was like the boy. He had always been an amiable chap.
Old Jolyon had sent this reply:</p>

<blockquote>'MY DEAR JO,<br>
<br>
'The sum (L500) stands in my books for the benefit of your boy,
under the name of Jolyon Forsyte, and will be duly-credited with
interest at 5 per cent. I hope that you are doing well. My health
remains good at present.<br>
<br>
'With love, I am,<br>
<br>
'Your affectionate Father,<br>
<br>
'JOLYON FORSYTE.'</blockquote>

<p>And every year on the 1st of January he had added a hundred and
the interest. The sum was mounting up&mdash;next New Year's Day it
would be fifteen hundred and odd pounds! And it is difficult to say
how much satisfaction he had got out of that yearly transaction.
But the correspondence had ended.</p>

<p>In spite of his love for his son, in spite of an instinct,
partly constitutional, partly the result, as in thousands of his
class, of the continual handling and watching of affairs, prompting
him to judge conduct by results rather than by principle, there was
at the bottom of his heart a sort of uneasiness. His son ought,
under the circumstances, to have gone to the dogs; that law was
laid down in all the novels, sermons, and plays he had ever read,
heard, or witnessed.</p>

<p>After receiving the cheque back there seemed to him to be
something wrong somewhere. Why had his son not gone to the dogs?
But, then, who could tell?</p>

<p>He had heard, of course&mdash;in fact, he had made it his
business to find out&mdash;that Jo lived in St. John's Wood, that
he had a little house in Wistaria Avenue with a garden, and took
his wife about with him into society&mdash;a queer sort of society,
no doubt&mdash;and that they had two children&mdash;the little chap
they called Jolly (considering the circumstances the name struck
him as cynical, and old Jolyon both feared and disliked cynicism),
and a girl called Holly, born since the marriage. Who could tell
what his son's circumstances really were? He had capitalized the
income he had inherited from his mother's father and joined Lloyd's
as an underwriter; he painted pictures, too&mdash;water-colours.
Old Jolyon knew this, for he had surreptitiously bought them from
time to time, after chancing to see his son's name signed at the
bottom of a representation of the river Thames in a dealer's
window. He thought them bad, and did not hang them because of the
signature; he kept them locked up in a drawer.</p>

<p>In the great opera-house a terrible yearning came on him to see
his son. He remembered the days when he had been wont to slide him,
in a brown holland suit, to and fro under the arch of his legs; the
times when he ran beside the boy's pony, teaching him to ride; the
day he first took him to school. He had been a loving, lovable
little chap! After he went to Eton he had acquired, perhaps, a
little too much of that desirable manner which old Jolyon knew was
only to be obtained at such places and at great expense; but he had
always been companionable. Always a companion, even after
Cambridge&mdash;a little far off, perhaps, owing to the advantages
he had received. Old Jolyon's feeling towards our public schools
and 'Varsities never wavered, and he retained touchingly his
attitude of admiration and mistrust towards a system appropriate to
the highest in the land, of which he had not himself been
privileged to partake...Now that June had gone and left, or as good
as left him, it would have been a comfort to see his son again.
Guilty of this treason to his family, his principles, his class,
old Jolyon fixed his eyes on the singer. A poor thing&mdash;a
wretched poor thing! And the Florian a perfect stick!</p>

<p>It was over. They were easily pleased nowadays!</p>

<p>In the crowded street he snapped up a cab under the very nose of
a stout and much younger gentleman, who had already assumed it to
be his own. His route lay through Pall Mall, and at the corner,
instead of going through the Green Park, the cabman turned to drive
up St. James's Street. Old Jolyon put his hand through the trap (he
could not bear being taken out of his way); in turning, however, he
found himself opposite the 'Hotch Potch,' and the yearning that had
been secretly with him the whole evening prevailed. He called to
the driver to stop. He would go in and ask if Jo still belonged
there.</p>

<p>He went in. The hall looked exactly as it did when he used to
dine there with Jack Herring, and they had the best cook in London;
and he looked round with the shrewd, straight glance that had
caused him all his life to be better served than most men.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jolyon Forsyte still a member here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; in the Club now, sir. What name?"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon was taken aback.</p>

<p>"His father," he said.</p>

<p>And having spoken, he took his stand, back to the fireplace.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon, on the point of leaving the Club, had put on his
hat, and was in the act of crossing the hall, as the porter met
him. He was no longer young, with hair going grey, and face&mdash;a
narrower replica of his father's, with the same large drooping
moustache&mdash;decidedly worn. He turned pale. This meeting was
terrible after all those years, for nothing in the world was so
terrible as a scene. They met and crossed hands without a word.
Then, with a quaver in his voice, the father said:</p>

<p>"How are you, my boy?"</p>

<p>The son answered:</p>

<p>"How are you, Dad?"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon's hand trembled in its thin lavender glove.</p>

<p>"If you're going my way," he said, "I can give you a lift."</p>

<p>And as though in the habit of taking each other home every night
they went out and stepped into the cab.</p>

<p>To old Jolyon it seemed that his son had grown. 'More of a man
altogether,' was his comment. Over the natural amiability of that
son's face had come a rather sardonic mask, as though he had found
in the circumstances of his life the necessity for armour. The
features were certainly those of a Forsyte, but the expression was
more the introspective look of a student or philosopher. He had no
doubt been obliged to look into himself a good deal in the course
of those fifteen years.</p>

<p>To young Jolyon the first sight of his father was undoubtedly a
shock&mdash;he looked so worn and old. But in the cab he seemed
hardly to have changed, still having the calm look so well
remembered, still being upright and keen-eyed.</p>

<p>"You look well, Dad."</p>

<p>"Middling," old Jolyon answered.</p>

<p>He was the prey of an anxiety that he found he must put into
words. Having got his son back like this, he felt he must know what
was his financial position.</p>

<p>"Jo," he said, "I should like to hear what sort of water you're
in. I suppose you're in debt?"</p>

<p>He put it this way that his son might find it easier to
confess.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon answered in his ironical voice:</p>

<p>"No! I'm not in debt!"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon saw that he was angry, and touched his hand. He had
run a risk. It was worth it, however, and Jo had never been sulky
with him. They drove on, without speaking again, to Stanhope Gate.
Old Jolyon invited him in, but young Jolyon shook his head.</p>

<p>"June's not here," said his father hastily: "went of to-day on a
visit. I suppose you know that she's engaged to be married?"</p>

<p>"Already?" murmured young Jolyon'.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon stepped out, and, in paying the cab fare, for the
first time in his life gave the driver a sovereign in mistake for a
shilling.</p>

<p>Placing the coin in his mouth, the cabman whipped his horse
secretly on the underneath and hurried away.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon turned the key softly in the lock, pushed open the
door, and beckoned. His son saw him gravely hanging up his coat,
with an expression on his face like that of a boy who intends to
steal cherries.</p>

<p>The door of the dining-room was open, the gas turned low; a
spirit-urn hissed on a tea-tray, and close to it a cynical looking
cat had fallen asleep on the dining-table. Old Jolyon 'shoo'd' her
off at once. The incident was a relief to his feelings; he rattled
his opera hat behind the animal.</p>

<p>"She's got fleas," he said, following her out of the room.
Through the door in the hall leading to the basement he called
"Hssst!" several times, as though assisting the cat's departure,
till by some strange coincidence the butler appeared below.</p>

<p>"You can go to bed, Parfitt," said old Jolyon. "I will lock up
and put out."</p>

<p>When he again entered the dining-room the cat unfortunately
preceded him, with her tail in the air, proclaiming that she had
seen through this manouevre for suppressing the butler from the
first...</p>

<p>A fatality had dogged old Jolyon's domestic stratagems all his
life.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon could not help smiling. He was very well versed in
irony, and everything that evening seemed to him ironical. The
episode of the cat; the announcement of his own daughter's
engagement. So he had no more part or parcel in her than he had in
the Puss! And the poetical justice of this appealed to him.</p>

<p>"What is June like now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She's a little thing," returned old Jolyon; "they say she's
like me, but that's their folly. She's more like your
mother&mdash;the same eyes and hair."</p>

<p>"Ah! and she is pretty?"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon was too much of a Forsyte to praise anything freely;
especially anything for which he had a genuine admiration.</p>

<p>"Not bad looking&mdash;a regular Forsyte chin. It'll be lonely
here when she's gone, Jo."</p>

<p>The look on his face again gave young Jolyon the shock he had
felt on first seeing his father.</p>

<p>"What will you do with yourself, Dad? I suppose she's wrapped up
in him?"</p>

<p>"Do with myself?" repeated old Jolyon with an angry break in his
voice. "It'll be miserable work living here alone. I don't know how
it's to end. I wish to goodness..." He checked himself, and added:
"The question is, what had I better do with this house?"</p>

<p>Young Jolyon looked round the room. It was peculiarly vast and
dreary, decorated with the enormous pictures of still life that he
remembered as a boy&mdash;sleeping dogs with their noses resting on
bunches of carrots, together with onions and grapes lying side by
side in mild surprise. The house was a white elephant, but he could
not conceive of his father living in a smaller place; and all the
more did it all seem ironical.</p>

<p>In his great chair with the book-rest sat old Jolyon, the
figurehead of his family and class and creed, with his white head
and dome-like forehead, the representative of moderation, and
order, and love of property. As lonely an old man as there was in
London.</p>

<p>There he sat in the gloomy comfort of the room, a puppet in the
power of great forces that cared nothing for family or class or
creed, but moved, machine-like, with dread processes to inscrutable
ends. This was how it struck young Jolyon, who had the impersonal
eye.</p>

<p>The poor old Dad! So this was the end, the purpose to which he
had lived with such magnificent moderation! To be lonely, and grow
older and older, yearning for a soul to speak to!</p>

<p>In his turn old Jolyon looked back at his son. He wanted to talk
about many things that he had been unable to talk about all these
years. It had been impossible to seriously confide in June his
conviction that property in the Soho quarter would go up in value;
his uneasiness about that tremendous silence of Pippin, the
superintendent of the New Colliery Company, of which he had so long
been chairman; his disgust at the steady fall in American
Golgothas, or even to discuss how, by some sort of settlement, he
could best avoid the payment of those death duties which would
follow his decease. Under the influence, however, of a cup of tea,
which he seemed to stir indefinitely, he began to speak at last. A
new vista of life was thus opened up, a promised land of talk,
where he could find a harbour against the waves of anticipation and
regret; where he could soothe his soul with the opium of devising
how to round off his property and make eternal the only part of him
that was to remain alive.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon was a good listener; it was his great quality. He
kept his eyes fixed on his father's face, putting a question now
and then.</p>

<p>The clock struck one before old Jolyon had finished, and at the
sound of its striking his principles came back. He took out his
watch with a look of surprise:</p>

<p>"I must go to bed, Jo," he said.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon rose and held out his hand to help his father up.
The old face looked worn and hollow again; the eyes were steadily
averted.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my boy; take care of yourself."</p>

<p>A moment passed, and young Jolyon, turning on his, heel, marched
out at the door. He could hardly see; his smile quavered. Never in
all the fifteen years since he had first found out that life was no
simple business, had he found it so singularly complicated.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER III&mdash;DINNER AT SWITHIN'S</h3>

<p>In Swithin's orange and light-blue dining-room, facing the Park,
the round table was laid for twelve.</p>

<p>A cut-glass chandelier filled with lighted candles hung like a
giant stalactite above its centre, radiating over large gilt-framed
mirrors, slabs of marble on the tops of side-tables, and heavy gold
chairs with crewel worked seats. Everything betokened that love of
beauty so deeply implanted in each family which has had its own way
to make into Society, out of the more vulgar heart of Nature.
Swithin had indeed an impatience of simplicity, a love of ormolu,
which had always stamped him amongst his associates as a man of
great, if somewhat luxurious taste; and out of the knowledge that
no one could possibly enter his rooms without perceiving him to be
a man of wealth, he had derived a solid and prolonged happiness
such as perhaps no other circumstance in life had afforded him.</p>

<p>Since his retirement from land agency, a profession deplorable
in his estimation, especially as to its auctioneering department,
he had abandoned himself to naturally aristocratic tastes.</p>

<p>The perfect luxury of his latter days had embedded him like a
fly in sugar; and his mind, where very little took place from
morning till night, was the junction of two curiously opposite
emotions, a lingering and sturdy satisfaction that he had made his
own way and his own fortune, and a sense that a man of his
distinction should never have been allowed to soil his mind with
work.</p>

<p>He stood at the sideboard in a white waistcoat with large gold
and onyx buttons, watching his valet screw the necks of three
champagne bottles deeper into ice-pails. Between the points of his
stand-up collar, which&mdash;though it hurt him to move&mdash;he
would on no account have had altered, the pale flesh of his under
chin remained immovable. His eyes roved from bottle to bottle. He
was debating, and he argued like this: Jolyon drinks a glass,
perhaps two, he's so careful of himself. James, he can't take his
wine nowadays. Nicholas&mdash;Fanny and he would swill water he
shouldn't wonder! Soames didn't count; these young
nephews&mdash;Soames was thirty-one&mdash;couldn't drink! But
Bosinney?</p>

<p>Encountering in the name of this stranger something outside the
range of his philosophy, Swithin paused. A misgiving arose within
him! It was impossible to tell! June was only a girl, in love too!
Emily (Mrs. James) liked a good glass of champagne. It was too dry
for Juley, poor old soul, she had no palate. As to Hatty Chessman!
The thought of this old friend caused a cloud of thought to obscure
the perfect glassiness of his eyes: He shouldn't wonder if she
drank half a bottle!</p>

<p>But in thinking of his remaining guest, an expression like that
of a cat who is just going to purr stole over his old face: Mrs.
Soames! She mightn't take much, but she would appreciate what she
drank; it was a pleasure to give her good wine! A pretty
woman&mdash;and sympathetic to him!</p>

<p>The thought of her was like champagne itself! A pleasure to give
a good wine to a young woman who looked so well, who knew how to
dress, with charming manners, quite distinguished&mdash;a pleasure
to entertain her. Between the points of his collar he gave his head
the first small, painful oscillation of the evening.</p>

<p>"Adolf!" he said. "Put in another bottle."</p>

<p>He himself might drink a good deal, for, thanks to that
prescription of Blight's, he found himself extremely well, and he
had been careful to take no lunch. He had not felt so well for
weeks. Puffing out his lower lip, he gave his last
instructions:</p>

<p>"Adolf, the least touch of the West India when you come to the
ham."</p>

<p>Passing into the anteroom, he sat down on the edge of a chair,
with his knees apart; and his tall, bulky form was wrapped at once
in an expectant, strange, primeval immobility. He was ready to rise
at a moment's notice. He had not given a dinner-party for months.
This dinner in honour of June's engagement had seemed a bore at
first (among Forsytes the custom of solemnizing engagements by
feasts was religiously observed), but the labours of sending
invitations and ordering the repast over, he felt pleasantly
stimulated.</p>

<p>And thus sitting, a watch in his hand, fat, and smooth, and
golden, like a flattened globe of butter, he thought of
nothing.</p>

<p>A long man, with side whiskers, who had once been in Swithin's
service, but was now a greengrocer, entered and proclaimed:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Chessman, Mrs. Septimus Small!"</p>

<p>Two ladies advanced. The one in front, habited entirely in red,
had large, settled patches of the same colour in her cheeks, and a
hard, dashing eye. She walked at Swithin, holding out a hand cased
in a long, primrose-coloured glove:</p>

<p>"Well! Swithin," she said, "I haven't seen you for ages. How are
you? Why, my dear boy, how stout you're getting!"</p>

<p>The fixity of Swithin's eye alone betrayed emotion. A dumb and
grumbling anger swelled his bosom. It was vulgar to be stout, to
talk of being stout; he had a chest, nothing more. Turning to his
sister, he grasped her hand, and said in a tone of command:</p>

<p>"Well, Juley."</p>

<p>Mrs. Septimus Small was the tallest of the four sisters; her
good, round old face had gone a little sour; an innumerable pout
clung all over it, as if it had been encased in an iron wire mask
up to that evening, which, being suddenly removed, left little
rolls of mutinous flesh all over her countenance. Even her eyes
were pouting. It was thus that she recorded her permanent
resentment at the loss of Septimus Small.</p>

<p>She had quite a reputation for saying the wrong thing, and,
tenacious like all her breed, she would hold to it when she had
said it, and add to it another wrong thing, and so on. With the
decease of her husband the family tenacity, the family
matter-of-factness, had gone sterile within her. A great talker,
when allowed, she would converse without the faintest animation for
hours together, relating, with epic monotony, the innumerable
occasions on which Fortune had misused her; nor did she ever
perceive that her hearers sympathized with Fortune, for her heart
was kind.</p>

<p>Having sat, poor soul, long by the bedside of Small (a man of
poor constitution), she had acquired, the habit, and there were
countless subsequent occasions when she had sat immense periods of
time to amuse sick people, children, and other helpless persons,
and she could never divest herself of the feeling that the world
was the most ungrateful place anybody could live in. Sunday after
Sunday she sat at the feet of that extremely witty preacher, the
Rev. Thomas Scoles, who exercised a great influence over her; but
she succeeded in convincing everybody that even this was a
misfortune. She had passed into a proverb in the family, and when
anybody was observed to be peculiarly distressing, he was known as
a regular 'Juley.' The habit of her mind would have killed anybody
but a Forsyte at forty; but she was seventy-two, and had never
looked better. And one felt that there were capacities for
enjoyment about her which might yet come out. She owned three
canaries, the cat Tommy, and half a parrot&mdash;in common with her
sister Hester;&mdash;and these poor creatures (kept carefully out
of Timothy's way&mdash;he was nervous about animals), unlike human
beings, recognising that she could not help being blighted,
attached themselves to her passionately.</p>

<p>She was sombrely magnificent this evening in black bombazine,
with a mauve front cut in a shy triangle, and crowned with a black
velvet ribbon round the base of her thin throat; black and mauve
for evening wear was esteemed very chaste by nearly every
Forsyte.</p>

<p>Pouting at Swithin, she said:</p>

<p>"Ann has been asking for you. You haven't been near us for an
age!"</p>

<p>Swithin put his thumbs within the armholes of his waistcoat, and
replied:</p>

<p>"Ann's getting very shaky; she ought to have a doctor!"</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. Nicholas Forsyte!"</p>

<p>Nicholas Forsyte, cocking his rectangular eyebrows, wore a
smile. He had succeeded during the day in bringing to fruition a
scheme for the employment of a tribe from Upper India in the
gold-mines of Ceylon. A pet plan, carried at last in the teeth of
great difficulties&mdash;he was justly pleased. It would double the
output of his mines, and, as he had often forcibly argued, all
experience tended to show that a man must die; and whether he died
of a miserable old age in his own country, or prematurely of damp
in the bottom of a foreign mine, was surely of little consequence,
provided that by a change in his mode of life he benefited the
British Empire.</p>

<p>His ability was undoubted. Raising his broken nose towards his
listener, he would add:</p>

<p>"For want of a few hundred of these fellows we haven't paid a
dividend for years, and look at the price of the shares. I can't
get ten shillings for them."</p>

<p>He had been at Yarmouth, too, and had come back feeling that he
had added at least ten years to his own life. He grasped Swithin's
hand, exclaiming in a jocular voice:</p>

<p>"Well, so here we are again!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Nicholas, an effete woman, smiled a smile of frightened
jollity behind his back.</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. James Forsyte! Mr. and Mrs. Soames Forsyte!"</p>

<p>Swithin drew his heels together, his deportment ever
admirable.</p>

<p>"Well, James, well Emily! How are you, Soames? How do you
do?"</p>

<p>His hand enclosed Irene's, and his eyes swelled. She was a
pretty woman&mdash;a little too pale, but her figure, her eyes, her
teeth! Too good for that chap Soames!</p>

<p>The gods had given Irene dark brown eyes and golden hair, that
strange combination, provocative of men's glances, which is said to
be the mark of a weak character. And the full, soft pallor of her
neck and shoulders, above a gold-coloured frock, gave to her
personality an alluring strangeness.</p>

<p>Soames stood behind, his eyes fastened on his wife's neck. The
hands of Swithin's watch, which he still held open in his hand, had
left eight behind; it was half an hour beyond his
dinner-time&mdash;he had had no lunch&mdash;and a strange primeval
impatience surged up within him.</p>

<p>"It's not like Jolyon to be late!" he said to Irene, with
uncontrollable vexation. "I suppose it'll be June keeping him!"</p>

<p>"People in love are always late," she answered.</p>

<p>Swithin stared at her; a dusky orange dyed his cheeks.</p>

<p>"They've no business to be. Some fashionable nonsense!"</p>

<p>And behind this outburst the inarticulate violence of primitive
generations seemed to mutter and grumble.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you think of my new star, Uncle Swithin," said
Irene softly.</p>

<p>Among the lace in the bosom of her dress was shining a
five-pointed star, made of eleven diamonds. Swithin looked at the
star. He had a pretty taste in stones; no question could have been
more sympathetically devised to distract his attention.</p>

<p>"Who gave you that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Soames."</p>

<p>There was no change in her face, but Swithin's pale eyes bulged
as though he might suddenly have been afflicted with insight.</p>

<p>"I dare say you're dull at home," he said. "Any day you like to
come and dine with me, I'll give you as good a bottle of wine as
you'll get in London."</p>

<p>"Miss June Forsyte&mdash;Mr. Jolyon Forsyte!... Mr.
Boswainey!..."</p>

<p>Swithin moved his arm, and said in a rumbling voice:</p>

<p>"Dinner, now&mdash;dinner!"</p>

<p>He took in Irene, on the ground that he had not entertained her
since she was a bride. June was the portion of Bosinney, who was
placed between Irene and his fiancee. On the other side of June was
James with Mrs. Nicholas, then old Jolyon with Mrs. James, Nicholas
with Hatty Chessman, Soames with Mrs. Small, completing, the circle
to Swithin again.</p>

<p>Family dinners of the Forsytes observe certain traditions. There
are, for instance, no hors d'oeuvre. The reason for this is
unknown. Theory among the younger members traces it to the
disgraceful price of oysters; it is more probably due to a desire
to come to the point, to a good practical sense deciding at once
that hors d'oeuvre are but poor things. The Jameses alone, unable
to withstand a custom almost universal in Park Lane, are now and
then unfaithful.</p>

<p>A silent, almost morose, inattention to each other succeeds to
the subsidence into their seats, lasting till well into the first
entree, but interspersed with remarks such as, "Tom's bad again; I
can't tell what's the matter with him!" "I suppose Ann doesn't come
down in the mornings?"&mdash;"What's the name of your doctor,
Fanny?" "Stubbs?" "He's a quack!"&mdash;"Winifred? She's got too
many children. Four, isn't it? She's as thin as a
lath!"&mdash;"What d'you give for this sherry, Swithin? Too dry for
me!"</p>

<p>With the second glass of champagne, a kind of hum makes itself
heard, which, when divested of casual accessories and resolved into
its primal element, is found to be James telling a story, and this
goes on for a long time, encroaching sometimes even upon what must
universally be recognised as the crowning point of a Forsyte
feast&mdash;'the saddle of mutton.'</p>

<p>No Forsyte has given a dinner without providing a saddle of
mutton. There is something in its succulent solidity which makes it
suitable to people 'of a certain position.' It is nourishing and
tasty; the sort of thing a man remembers eating. It has a past and
a future, like a deposit paid into a bank; and it is something that
can be argued about.</p>

<p>Each branch of the family tenaciously held to a particular
locality&mdash;old Jolyon swearing by Dartmoor, James by Welsh,
Swithin by Southdown, Nicholas maintaining that people might sneer,
but there was nothing like New Zealand! As for Roger, the
'original' of the brothers, he had been obliged to invent a
locality of his own, and with an ingenuity worthy of a man who had
devised a new profession for his sons, he had discovered a shop
where they sold German; on being remonstrated with, he had proved
his point by producing a butcher's bill, which showed that he paid
more than any of the others. It was on this occasion that old
Jolyon, turning to June, had said in one of his bursts of
philosophy:</p>

<p>"You may depend upon it, they're a cranky lot, the
Forsytes&mdash;and you'll find it out, as you grow older!"</p>

<p>Timothy alone held apart, for though he ate saddle of mutton
heartily, he was, he said, afraid of it.</p>

<p>To anyone interested psychologically in Forsytes, this great
saddle-of-mutton trait is of prime importance; not only does it
illustrate their tenacity, both collectively and as individuals,
but it marks them as belonging in fibre and instincts to that great
class which believes in nourishment and flavour, and yields to no
sentimental craving for beauty.</p>

<p>Younger members of the family indeed would have done without a
joint altogether, preferring guinea-fowl, or lobster
salad&mdash;something which appealed to the imagination, and had
less nourishment&mdash;but these were females; or, if not, had been
corrupted by their wives, or by mothers, who having been forced to
eat saddle of mutton throughout their married lives, had passed a
secret hostility towards it into the fibre of their sons.</p>

<p>The great saddle-of-mutton controversy at an end, a Tewkesbury
ham commenced, together with the least touch of West
Indian&mdash;Swithin was so long over this course that he caused a
block in the progress of the dinner. To devote himself to it with
better heart, he paused in his conversation.</p>

<p>From his seat by Mrs. Septimus Small Soames was watching. He had
a reason of his own connected with a pet building scheme, for
observing Bosinney. The architect might do for his purpose; he
looked clever, as he sat leaning back in his chair, moodily making
little ramparts with bread-crumbs. Soames noted his dress clothes
to be well cut, but too small, as though made many years ago.</p>

<p>He saw him turn to Irene and say something and her face sparkle
as he often saw it sparkle at other people&mdash;never at himself.
He tried to catch what they were saying, but Aunt Juley was
speaking.</p>

<p>Hadn't that always seemed very extraordinary to Soames? Only
last Sunday dear Mr. Scole, had been so witty in his sermon, so
sarcastic, "For what," he had said, "shall it profit a man if he
gain his own soul, but lose all his property?" That, he had said,
was the motto of the middle-class; now, what had he meant by that?
Of course, it might be what middle-class people believed&mdash;she
didn't know; what did Soames think?</p>

<p>He answered abstractedly: "How should I know? Scoles is a
humbug, though, isn't he?" For Bosinney was looking round the
table, as if pointing out the peculiarities of the guests, and
Soames wondered what he was saying. By her smile Irene was
evidently agreeing with his remarks. She seemed always to agree
with other people.</p>

<p>Her eyes were turned on himself; Soames dropped his glance at
once. The smile had died off her lips.</p>

<p>A humbug? But what did Soames mean? If Mr. Scoles was a humbug,
a clergyman&mdash;then anybody might be&mdash;it was frightful!</p>

<p>"Well, and so they are!" said Soames.</p>

<p>During Aunt Juley's momentary and horrified silence he caught
some words of Irene's that sounded like: 'Abandon hope, all ye who
enter here!'</p>

<p>But Swithin had finished his ham.</p>

<p>"Where do you go for your mushrooms?" he was saying to Irene in
a voice like a courtier's; "you ought to go to
Smileybob's&mdash;he'll give 'em you fresh. These little men, they
won't take the trouble!"</p>

<p>Irene turned to answer him, and Soames saw Bosinney watching her
and smiling to himself. A curious smile the fellow had. A
half-simple arrangement, like a child who smiles when he is
pleased. As for George's nickname&mdash;'The Buccaneer'&mdash;he
did not think much of that. And, seeing Bosinney turn to June,
Soames smiled too, but sardonically&mdash;he did not like June, who
was not looking too pleased.</p>

<p>This was not surprising, for she had just held the following
conversation with James:</p>

<p>"I stayed on the river on my way home, Uncle James, and saw a
beautiful site for a house."</p>

<p>James, a slow and thorough eater, stopped the process of
mastication.</p>

<p>"Eh?" he said. "Now, where was that?"</p>

<p>"Close to Pangbourne."</p>

<p>James placed a piece of ham in his mouth, and June waited.</p>

<p>"I suppose you wouldn't know whether the land about there was
freehold?" he asked at last. "You wouldn't know anything about the
price of land about there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said June; "I made inquiries." Her little resolute face
under its copper crown was suspiciously eager and aglow.</p>

<p>James regarded her with the air of an inquisitor.</p>

<p>"What? You're not thinking of buying land!" he ejaculated,
dropping his fork.</p>

<p>June was greatly encouraged by his interest. It had long been
her pet plan that her uncles should benefit themselves and Bosinney
by building country-houses.</p>

<p>"Of course not," she said. "I thought it would be such a
splendid place for&mdash;you or&mdash;someone to build a
country-house!"</p>

<p>James looked at her sideways, and placed a second piece of ham
in his mouth...</p>

<p>"Land ought to be very dear about there," he said.</p>

<p>What June had taken for personal interest was only the
impersonal excitement of every Forsyte who hears of something
eligible in danger of passing into other hands. But she refused to
see the disappearance of her chance, and continued to press her
point.</p>

<p>"You ought to go into the country, Uncle James. I wish I had a
lot of money, I wouldn't live another day in London."</p>

<p>James was stirred to the depths of his long thin figure; he had
no idea his niece held such downright views.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go into the country?" repeated June; "it would do
you a lot of good."</p>

<p>"Why?" began James in a fluster. "Buying land&mdash;what good
d'you suppose I can do buying land, building houses?&mdash;I
couldn't get four per cent. for my money!"</p>

<p>"What does that matter? You'd get fresh air."</p>

<p>"Fresh air!" exclaimed James; "what should I do with fresh
air,"</p>

<p>"I should have thought anybody liked to have fresh air," said
June scornfully.</p>

<p>James wiped his napkin all over his mouth.</p>

<p>"You don't know the value of money," he said, avoiding her
eye.</p>

<p>"No! and I hope I never shall!" and, biting her lip with
inexpressible mortification, poor June was silent.</p>

<p>Why were her own relations so rich, and Phil never knew where
the money was coming from for to-morrow's tobacco. Why couldn't
they do something for him? But they were so selfish. Why couldn't
they build country-houses? She had all that naive dogmatism which
is so pathetic, and sometimes achieves such great results.
Bosinney, to whom she turned in her discomfiture, was talking to
Irene, and a chill fell on June's spirit. Her eyes grew steady with
anger, like old Jolyon's when his will was crossed.</p>

<p>James, too, was much disturbed. He felt as though someone had
threatened his right to invest his money at five per cent. Jolyon
had spoiled her. None of his girls would have said such a thing.
James had always been exceedingly liberal to his children, and the
consciousness of this made him feel it all the more deeply. He
trifled moodily with his strawberries, then, deluging them with
cream, he ate them quickly; they, at all events, should not escape
him.</p>

<p>No wonder he was upset. Engaged for fifty-four years (he had
been admitted a solicitor on the earliest day sanctioned by the
law) in arranging mortgages, preserving investments at a dead level
of high and safe interest, conducting negotiations on the principle
of securing the utmost possible out of other people compatible with
safety to his clients and himself, in calculations as to the exact
pecuniary possibilities of all the relations of life, he had come
at last to think purely in terms of money. Money was now his light,
his medium for seeing, that without which he was really unable to
see, really not cognisant of phenomena; and to have this thing, "I
hope I shall never know the value of money!" said to his face,
saddened and exasperated him. He knew it to be nonsense, or it
would have frightened him. What was the world coming to! Suddenly
recollecting the story of young Jolyon, however, he felt a little
comforted, for what could you expect with a father like that! This
turned his thoughts into a channel still less pleasant. What was
all this talk about Soames and Irene?</p>

<p>As in all self-respecting families, an emporium had been
established where family secrets were bartered, and family stock
priced. It was known on Forsyte 'Change that Irene regretted her
marriage. Her regret was disapproved of. She ought to have known
her own mind; no dependable woman made these mistakes.</p>

<p>James reflected sourly that they had a nice house (rather small)
in an excellent position, no children, and no money troubles.
Soames was reserved about his affairs, but he must be getting a
very warm man. He had a capital income from the business&mdash;for
Soames, like his father, was a member of that well-known firm of
solicitors, Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte&mdash;and had always been
very careful. He had done quite unusually well with some mortgages
he had taken up, too&mdash;a little timely foreclosure&mdash;most
lucky hits!</p>

<p>There was no reason why Irene should not be happy, yet they said
she'd been asking for a separate room. He knew where that ended. It
wasn't as if Soames drank.</p>

<p>James looked at his daughter-in-law. That unseen glance of his
was cold and dubious. Appeal and fear were in it, and a sense of
personal grievance. Why should he be worried like this? It was very
likely all nonsense; women were funny things! They exaggerated so,
you didn't know what to believe; and then, nobody told him
anything, he had to find out everything for himself. Again he
looked furtively at Irene, and across from her to Soames. The
latter, listening to Aunt Juley, was looking up, under his brows in
the direction of Bosinney.</p>

<p>'He's fond of her, I know,' thought James. 'Look at the way he's
always giving her things.'</p>

<p>And the extraordinary unreasonableness of her disaffection
struck him with increased force.</p>

<p>It was a pity, too, she was a taking little thing, and he,
James, would be really quite fond of her if she'd only let him. She
had taken up lately with June; that was doing her no good, that was
certainly doing her no good. She was getting to have opinions of
her own. He didn't know what she wanted with anything of the sort.
She'd a good home, and everything she could wish for. He felt that
her friends ought to be chosen for her. To go on like this was
dangerous.</p>

<p>June, indeed, with her habit of championing the unfortunate, had
dragged from Irene a confession, and, in return, had preached the
necessity of facing the evil, by separation, if need be. But in the
face of these exhortations, Irene had kept a brooding silence, as
though she found terrible the thought of this struggle carried
through in cold blood. He would never give her up, she had said to
June.</p>

<p>"Who cares?" June cried; "let him do what he likes&mdash;you've
only to stick to it!" And she had not scrupled to say something of
this sort at Timothy's; James, when he heard of it, had felt a
natural indignation and horror.</p>

<p>What if Irene were to take it into her head to&mdash;he could
hardly frame the thought&mdash;to leave Soames? But he felt this
thought so unbearable that he at once put it away; the shady
visions it conjured up, the sound of family tongues buzzing in his
ears, the horror of the conspicuous happening so close to him, to
one of his own children! Luckily, she had no money&mdash;a beggarly
fifty pound a year! And he thought of the deceased Heron, who had
had nothing to leave her, with contempt. Brooding over his glass,
his long legs twisted under the table, he quite omitted to rise
when the ladies left the room. He would have to speak to
Soames&mdash;would have to put him on his guard; they could not go
on like this, now that such a contingency had occurred to him. And
he noticed with sour disfavour that June had left her wine-glasses
full of wine.</p>

<p>'That little, thing's at the bottom of it all,' he mused;
'Irene'd never have thought of it herself.' James was a man of
imagination.</p>

<p>The voice of Swithin roused him from his reverie.</p>

<p>"I gave four hundred pounds for it," he was saying. "Of course
it's a regular work of art."</p>

<p>"Four hundred! H'm! that's a lot of money!" chimed in
Nicholas.</p>

<p>The object alluded to was an elaborate group of statuary in
Italian marble, which, placed upon a lofty stand (also of marble),
diffused an atmosphere of culture throughout the room. The
subsidiary figures, of which there were six, female, nude, and of
highly ornate workmanship, were all pointing towards the central
figure, also nude, and female, who was pointing at herself; and all
this gave the observer a very pleasant sense of her extreme value.
Aunt Juley, nearly opposite, had had the greatest difficulty in not
looking at it all the evening.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon spoke; it was he who had started the discussion.</p>

<p>"Four hundred fiddlesticks! Don't tell me you gave four hundred
for that?"</p>

<p>Between the points of his collar Swithin's chin made the second
painful oscillatory movement of the evening.</p>

<p>"Four-hundred-pounds, of English money; not a farthing less. I
don't regret it. It's not common English&mdash;it's genuine modern
Italian!"</p>

<p>Soames raised the corner of his lip in a smile, and looked
across at Bosinney. The architect was grinning behind the fumes of
his cigarette. Now, indeed, he looked more like a buccaneer.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of work about it," remarked James hastily, who
was really moved by the size of the group. "It'd sell well at
Jobson's."</p>

<p>"The poor foreign dey-vil that made it," went on Swithin, "asked
me five hundred&mdash;I gave him four. It's worth eight. Looked
half-starved, poor dey-vil!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" chimed in Nicholas suddenly, "poor, seedy-lookin' chaps,
these artists; it's a wonder to me how they live. Now, there's
young Flageoletti, that Fanny and the girls are always hav'in' in,
to play the fiddle; if he makes a hundred a year it's as much as
ever he does!"</p>

<p>James shook his head. "Ah!" he said, "I don't know how they
live!"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon had risen, and, cigar in mouth, went to inspect the
group at close quarters.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't have given two for it!" he pronounced at last.</p>

<p>Soames saw his father and Nicholas glance at each other
anxiously; and, on the other side of Swithin, Bosinney, still
shrouded in smoke.</p>

<p>'I wonder what he thinks of it?' thought Soames, who knew well
enough that this group was hopelessly vieux jeu; hopelessly of the
last generation. There was no longer any sale at Jobson's for such
works of art.</p>

<p>Swithin's answer came at last. "You never knew anything about a
statue. You've got your pictures, and that's all!"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon walked back to his seat, puffing his cigar. It was
not likely that he was going to be drawn into an argument with an
obstinate beggar like Swithin, pig-headed as a mule, who had never
known a statue from a&mdash;straw hat.</p>

<p>"Stucco!" was all he said.</p>

<p>It had long been physically impossible for Swithin to start; his
fist came down on the table.</p>

<p>"Stucco! I should like to see anything you've got in your house
half as good!"</p>

<p>And behind his speech seemed to sound again that rumbling
violence of primitive generations.</p>

<p>It was James who saved the situation.</p>

<p>"Now, what do you say, Mr. Bosinney? You're an architect; you
ought to know all about statues and things!"</p>

<p>Every eye was turned upon Bosinney; all waited with a strange,
suspicious look for his answer.</p>

<p>And Soames, speaking for the first time, asked:</p>

<p>"Yes, Bosinney, what do you say?"</p>

<p>Bosinney replied coolly:</p>

<p>"The work is a remarkable one."</p>

<p>His words were addressed to Swithin, his eyes smiled slyly at
old Jolyon; only Soames remained unsatisfied.</p>

<p>"Remarkable for what?"</p>

<p>"For its naivete."</p>

<p>The answer was followed by an impressive silence; Swithin alone
was not sure whether a compliment was intended.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER IV&mdash;PROJECTION OF THE HOUSE</h3>

<p>Soames Forsyte walked out of his green-painted front door three
days after the dinner at Swithin's, and looking back from across
the Square, confirmed his impression that the house wanted
painting.</p>

<p>He had left his wife sitting on the sofa in the drawing-room,
her hands crossed in her lap, manifestly waiting for him to go out.
This was not unusual. It happened, in fact, every day.</p>

<p>He could not understand what she found wrong with him. It was
not as if he drank! Did he run into debt, or gamble, or swear; was
he violent; were his friends rackety; did he stay out at night? On
the contrary.</p>

<p>The profound, subdued aversion which he felt in his wife was a
mystery to him, and a source of the most terrible irritation. That
she had made a mistake, and did not love him, had tried to love him
and could not love him, was obviously no reason.</p>

<p>He that could imagine so outlandish a cause for his wife's not
getting on with him was certainly no Forsyte.</p>

<p>Soames was forced, therefore, to set the blame entirely down to
his wife. He had never met a woman so capable of inspiring
affection. They could not go anywhere without his seeing how all
the men were attracted by her; their looks, manners, voices,
betrayed it; her behaviour under this attention had been beyond
reproach. That she was one of those women&mdash;not too common in
the Anglo-Saxon race&mdash;born to be loved and to love, who when
not loving are not living, had certainly never even occurred to
him. Her power of attraction, he regarded as part of her value as
his property; but it made him, indeed, suspect that she could give
as well as receive; and she gave him nothing! 'Then why did she
marry me?' was his continual thought. He had, forgotten his
courtship; that year and a half when he had besieged and lain in
wait for her, devising schemes for her entertainment, giving her
presents, proposing to her periodically, and keeping her other
admirers away with his perpetual presence. He had forgotten the day
when, adroitly taking advantage of an acute phase of her dislike to
her home surroundings, he crowned his labours with success. If he
remembered anything, it was the dainty capriciousness with which
the gold-haired, dark-eyed girl had treated him. He certainly did
not remember the look on her face&mdash;strange, passive,
appealing&mdash;when suddenly one day she had yielded, and said
that she would marry him.</p>

<p>It had been one of those real devoted wooings which books and
people praise, when the lover is at length rewarded for hammering
the iron till it is malleable, and all must be happy ever after as
the wedding bells.</p>

<p>Soames walked eastwards, mousing doggedly along on the shady
side.</p>

<p>The house wanted doing, up, unless he decided to move into the
country, and build.</p>

<p>For the hundredth time that month he turned over this problem.
There was no use in rushing into things! He was very comfortably
off, with an increasing income getting on for three thousand a
year; but his invested capital was not perhaps so large as his
father believed&mdash;James had a tendency to expect that his
children should be better off than they were. 'I can manage eight
thousand easily enough,' he thought, 'without calling in either
Robertson's or Nicholl's.'</p>

<p>He had stopped to look in at a picture shop, for Soames was an
'amateur' of pictures, and had a little-room in No. 62, Montpellier
Square, full of canvases, stacked against the wall, which he had no
room to hang. He brought them home with him on his way back from
the City, generally after dark, and would enter this room on Sunday
afternoons, to spend hours turning the pictures to the light,
examining the marks on their backs, and occasionally making
notes.</p>

<p>They were nearly all landscapes with figures in the foreground,
a sign of some mysterious revolt against London, its tall houses,
its interminable streets, where his life and the lives of his breed
and class were passed. Every now and then he would take one or two
pictures away with him in a cab, and stop at Jobson's on his way
into the City.</p>

<p>He rarely showed them to anyone; Irene, whose opinion he
secretly respected and perhaps for that reason never solicited, had
only been into the room on rare occasions, in discharge of some
wifely duty. She was not asked to look at the pictures, and she
never did. To Soames this was another grievance. He hated that
pride of hers, and secretly dreaded it.</p>

<p>In the plate-glass window of the picture shop his image stood
and looked at him.</p>

<p>His sleek hair under the brim of the tall hat had a sheen like
the hat itself; his cheeks, pale and flat, the line of his
clean-shaven lips, his firm chin with its greyish shaven tinge, and
the buttoned strictness of his black cut-away coat, conveyed an
appearance of reserve and secrecy, of imperturbable, enforced
composure; but his eyes, cold,&mdash;grey, strained&mdash;looking,
with a line in the brow between them, examined him wistfully, as if
they knew of a secret weakness.</p>

<p>He noted the subjects of the pictures, the names of the
painters, made a calculation of their values, but without the
satisfaction he usually derived from this inward appraisement, and
walked on.</p>

<p>No. 62 would do well enough for another year, if he decided to
build! The times were good for building, money had not been so dear
for years; and the site he had seen at Robin Hill, when he had gone
down there in the spring to inspect the Nicholl mortgage&mdash;what
could be better! Within twelve miles of Hyde Park Corner, the value
of the land certain to go up, would always fetch more than he gave
for it; so that a house, if built in really good style, was a
first-class investment.</p>

<p>The notion of being the one member of his family with a country
house weighed but little with him; for to a true Forsyte,
sentiment, even the sentiment of social position, was a luxury only
to be indulged in after his appetite for more material pleasure had
been satisfied.</p>

<p>To get Irene out of London, away from opportunities of going
about and seeing people, away from her friends and those who put
ideas into her head! That was the thing! She was too thick with
June! June disliked him. He returned the sentiment. They were of
the same blood.</p>

<p>It would be everything to get Irene out of town. The house would
please her she would enjoy messing about with the decoration, she
was very artistic!</p>

<p>The house must be in good style, something that would always be
certain to command a price, something unique, like that last house
of Parkes, which had a tower; but Parkes had himself said that his
architect was ruinous. You never knew where you were with those
fellows; if they had a name they ran you into no end of expense and
were conceited into the bargain.</p>

<p>And a common architect was no good&mdash;the memory of Parkes'
tower precluded the employment of a common architect:</p>

<p>This was why he had thought of Bosinney. Since the dinner at
Swithin's he had made enquiries, the result of which had been
meagre, but encouraging: "One of the new school."</p>

<p>"Clever?"</p>

<p>"As clever as you like&mdash;a bit&mdash;a bit up in the
air!"</p>

<p>He had not been able to discover what houses Bosinney had built,
nor what his charges were. The impression he gathered was that he
would be able to make his own terms. The more he reflected on the
idea, the more he liked it. It would be keeping the thing in the
family, with Forsytes almost an instinct; and he would be able to
get 'favoured-nation,' if not nominal terms&mdash;only fair,
considering the chance to Bosinney of displaying his talents, for
this house must be no common edifice.</p>

<p>Soames reflected complacently on the work it would be sure to
bring the young man; for, like every Forsyte, he could be a
thorough optimist when there was anything to be had out of it.</p>

<p>Bosinney's office was in Sloane Street, close at, hand, so that
he would be able to keep his eye continually on the plans.</p>

<p>Again, Irene would not be to likely to object to leave London if
her greatest friend's lover were given the job. June's marriage
might depend on it. Irene could not decently stand in the way of
June's marriage; she would never do that, he knew her too well. And
June would be pleased; of this he saw the advantage.</p>

<p>Bosinney looked clever, but he had also&mdash;and&mdash;it was
one of his great attractions&mdash;an air as if he did not quite
know on which side his bread were buttered; he should be easy to
deal with in money matters. Soames made this reflection in no
defrauding spirit; it was the natural attitude of his mind&mdash;of
the mind of any good business man&mdash;of all those thousands of
good business men through whom he was threading his way up Ludgate
Hill.</p>

<p>Thus he fulfilled the inscrutable laws of his great
class&mdash;of human nature itself&mdash;when he reflected, with a
sense of comfort, that Bosinney would be easy to deal with in money
matters.</p>

<p>While he elbowed his way on, his eyes, which he usually kept
fixed on the ground before his feet, were attracted upwards by the
dome of St. Paul's. It had a peculiar fascination for him, that old
dome, and not once, but twice or three times a week, would he halt
in his daily pilgrimage to enter beneath and stop in the side
aisles for five or ten minutes, scrutinizing the names and epitaphs
on the monuments. The attraction for him of this great church was
inexplicable, unless it enabled him to concentrate his thoughts on
the business of the day. If any affair of particular moment, or
demanding peculiar acuteness, was weighing on his mind, he
invariably went in, to wander with mouse-like attention from
epitaph to epitaph. Then retiring in the same noiseless way, he
would hold steadily on up Cheapside, a thought more of dogged
purpose in his gait, as though he had seen something which he had
made up his mind to buy.</p>

<p>He went in this morning, but, instead of stealing from monument
to monument, turned his eyes upwards to the columns and spacings of
the walls, and remained motionless.</p>

<p>His uplifted face, with the awed and wistful look which faces
take on themselves in church, was whitened to a chalky hue in the
vast building. His gloved hands were clasped in front over the
handle of his umbrella. He lifted them. Some sacred inspiration
perhaps had come to him.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he thought, 'I must have room to hang my pictures.</p>

<p>That evening, on his return from the City, he called at
Bosinney's office. He found the architect in his shirt-sleeves,
smoking a pipe, and ruling off lines on a plan. Soames refused a
drink, and came at once to the point.</p>

<p>"If you've nothing better to do on Sunday, come down with me to
Robin Hill, and give me your opinion on a building site."</p>

<p>"Are you going to build?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Soames; "but don't speak of it. I just want your
opinion."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said the architect.</p>

<p>Soames peered about the room.</p>

<p>"You're rather high up here," he remarked.</p>

<p>Any information he could gather about the nature and scope of
Bosinney's business would be all to the good.</p>

<p>"It does well enough for me so far," answered the architect.
"You're accustomed to the swells."</p>

<p>He knocked out his pipe, but replaced it empty between his
teeth; it assisted him perhaps to carry on the conversation. Soames
noted a hollow in each cheek, made as it were by suction.</p>

<p>"What do you pay for an office like this?" said he.</p>

<p>"Fifty too much," replied Bosinney.</p>

<p>This answer impressed Soames favourably.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is dear," he said. "I'll call for you&mdash;on
Sunday about eleven."</p>

<p>The following Sunday therefore he called for Bosinney in a
hansom, and drove him to the station. On arriving at Robin Hill,
they found no cab, and started to walk the mile and a half to the
site.</p>

<p>It was the 1st of August&mdash;a perfect day, with a burning sun
and cloudless sky&mdash;and in the straight, narrow road leading up
the hill their feet kicked up a yellow dust.</p>

<p>"Gravel soil," remarked Soames, and sideways he glanced at the
coat Bosinney wore. Into the side-pockets of this coat were thrust
bundles of papers, and under one arm was carried a queer-looking
stick. Soames noted these and other peculiarities.</p>

<p>No one but a clever man, or, indeed, a buccaneer, would have
taken such liberties with his appearance; and though these
eccentricities were revolting to Soames, he derived a certain
satisfaction from them, as evidence of qualities by which he must
inevitably profit. If the fellow could build houses, what did his
clothes matter?</p>

<p>"I told you," he said, "that I want this house to be a surprise,
so don't say anything about it. I never talk of my affairs until
they're carried through."</p>

<p>Bosinney nodded.</p>

<p>"Let women into your plans," pursued Soames, "and you never know
where it'll end."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Said Bosinney, "women are the devil!"</p>

<p>This feeling had long been at the&mdash;bottom of Soames's
heart; he had never, however, put it into words.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he Muttered, "so you're beginning to..." He stopped, but
added, with an uncontrollable burst of spite: "June's got a temper
of her own&mdash;always had."</p>

<p>"A temper's not a bad thing in an angel."</p>

<p>Soames had never called Irene an angel. He could not so have
violated his best instincts, letting other people into the secret
of her value, and giving himself away. He made no reply.</p>

<p>They had struck into a half-made road across a warren. A
cart-track led at right-angles to a gravel pit, beyond which the
chimneys of a cottage rose amongst a clump of trees at the border
of a thick wood. Tussocks of feathery grass covered the rough
surface of the ground, and out of these the larks soared into the
hate of sunshine. On the far horizon, over a countless succession
of fields and hedges, rose a line of downs.</p>

<p>Soames led till they had crossed to the far side, and there he
stopped. It was the chosen site; but now that he was about to
divulge the spot to another he had become uneasy.</p>

<p>"The agent lives in that cottage," he said; "he'll give us some
lunch&mdash;we'd better have lunch before we go into this
matter."</p>

<p>He again took the lead to the cottage, where the agent, a tall
man named Oliver, with a heavy face and grizzled beard, welcomed
them. During lunch, which Soames hardly touched, he kept looking at
Bosinney, and once or twice passed his silk handkerchief stealthily
over his forehead. The meal came to an end at last, and Bosinney
rose.</p>

<p>"I dare say you've got business to talk over," he said; "I'll
just go and nose about a bit." Without waiting for a reply he
strolled out.</p>

<p>Soames was solicitor to this estate, and he spent nearly an hour
in the agent's company, looking at ground-plans and discussing the
Nicholl and other mortgages; it was as it were by an afterthought
that he brought up the question of the building site.</p>

<p>"Your people," he said, "ought to come down in their price to
me, considering that I shall be the first to build."</p>

<p>Oliver shook his head.</p>

<p>The site you've fixed on, Sir, he said, "is the cheapest we've
got. Sites at the top of the slope are dearer by a good bit."</p>

<p>"Mind," said Soames, "I've not decided; it's quite possible I
shan't build at all. The ground rent's very high."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Forsyte, I shall be sorry if you go off, and I think
you'll make a mistake, Sir. There's not a bit of land near London
with such a view as this, nor one that's cheaper, all things
considered; we've only to advertise, to get a mob of people after
it."</p>

<p>They looked at each other. Their faces said very plainly: 'I
respect you as a man of business; and you can't expect me to
believe a word you say.'</p>

<p>Well, repeated Soames, "I haven't made up my mind; the thing
will very likely go off!" With these words, taking up his umbrella,
he put his chilly hand into the agent's, withdrew it without the
faintest pressure, and went out into the sun.</p>

<p>He walked slowly back towards the site in deep thought. His
instinct told him that what the agent had said was true. A cheap
site. And the beauty of it was, that he knew the agent did not
really think it cheap; so that his own intuitive knowledge was a
victory over the agent's.</p>

<p>'Cheap or not, I mean to have it,' he thought.</p>

<p>The larks sprang up in front of his feet, the air was full of
butterflies, a sweet fragrance rose from the wild grasses. The
sappy scent of the bracken stole forth from the wood, where, hidden
in the depths, pigeons were cooing, and from afar on the warm
breeze, came the rhythmic chiming of church bells.</p>

<p>Soames walked with his eyes on the ground, his lips opening and
closing as though in anticipation of a delicious morsel. But when
he arrived at the site, Bosinney was nowhere to be seen. After
waiting some little time, he crossed the warren in the direction of
the slope. He would have shouted, but dreaded the sound of his
voice.</p>

<p>The warren was as lonely as a prairie, its silence only broken
by the rustle of rabbits bolting to their holes, and the song of
the larks.</p>

<p>Soames, the pioneer-leader of the great Forsyte army advancing
to the civilization of this wilderness, felt his spirit daunted by
the loneliness, by the invisible singing, and the hot, sweet air.
He had begun to retrace his steps when he at last caught sight of
Bosinney.</p>

<p>The architect was sprawling under a large oak tree, whose trunk,
with a huge spread of bough and foliage, ragged with age, stood on
the verge of the rise.</p>

<p>Soames had to touch him on the shoulder before he looked up.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Forsyte," he said, "I've found the very place for your
house! Look here!"</p>

<p>Soames stood and looked, then he said, coldly:</p>

<p>"You may be very clever, but this site will cost me half as much
again."</p>

<p>"Hang the cost, man. Look at the view!"</p>

<p>Almost from their feet stretched ripe corn, dipping to a small
dark copse beyond. A plain of fields and hedges spread to the
distant grey-bluedowns. In a silver streak to the right could be
seen the line of the river.</p>

<p>The sky was so blue, and the sun so bright, that an eternal
summer seemed to reign over this prospect. Thistledown floated
round them, enraptured by the serenity, of the ether. The heat
danced over the corn, and, pervading all, was a soft, insensible
hum, like the murmur of bright minutes holding revel between earth
and heaven.</p>

<p>Soames looked. In spite of himself, something swelled in his
breast. To live here in sight of all this, to be able to point it
out to his friends, to talk of it, to possess it! His cheeks
flushed. The warmth, the radiance, the glow, were sinking into his
senses as, four years before, Irene's beauty had sunk into his
senses and made him long for her. He stole a glance at Bosinney,
whose eyes, the eyes of the coachman's 'half-tame leopard,' seemed
running wild over the landscape. The sunlight had caught the
promontories of the fellow's face, the bumpy cheekbones, the point
of his chin, the vertical ridges above his brow; and Soames watched
this rugged, enthusiastic, careless face with an unpleasant
feeling.</p>

<p>A long, soft ripple of wind flowed over the corn, and brought a
puff of warm air into their faces.</p>

<p>"I could build you a teaser here," said Bosinney, breaking the
silence at last.</p>

<p>"I dare say," replied Soames, drily. "You haven't got to pay for
it."</p>

<p>"For about eight thousand I could build you a palace."</p>

<p>Soames had become very pale&mdash;a struggle was going on within
him. He dropped his eyes, and said stubbornly:</p>

<p>"I can't afford it."</p>

<p>And slowly, with his mousing walk, he led the way back to the
first site.</p>

<p>They spent some time there going into particulars of the
projected house, and then Soames returned to the agent's
cottage.</p>

<p>He came out in about half an hour, and, joining Bosinney,
started for the station.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, hardly opening his lips, "I've taken that site
of yours, after all."</p>

<p>And again he was silent, confusedly debating how it was that
this fellow, whom by habit he despised, should have overborne his
own decision.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER V&mdash;A FORSYTE MENAGE</h3>

<p>Like the enlightened thousands of his class and generation in
this great city of London, who no longer believe in red velvet
chairs, and know that groups of modern Italian marble are 'vieux
jeu,' Soames Forsyte inhabited a house which did what it could. It
owned a copper door knocker of individual design, windows which had
been altered to open outwards, hanging flower boxes filled with
fuchsias, and at the back (a great feature) a little court tiled
with jade-green tiles, and surrounded by pink hydrangeas in
peacock-blue tubs. Here, under a parchment-coloured Japanese
sunshade covering the whole end, inhabitants or visitors could be
screened from the eyes of the curious while they drank tea and
examined at their leisure the latest of Soames's little silver
boxes.</p>

<p>The inner decoration favoured the First Empire and William
Morris. For its size, the house was commodious; there were
countless nooks resembling birds' nests, and little things made of
silver were deposited like eggs.</p>

<p>In this general perfection two kinds of fastidiousness were at
war. There lived here a mistress who would have dwelt daintily on a
desert island; a master whose daintiness was, as it were, an
investment, cultivated by the owner for his advancement, in
accordance with the laws of competition. This competitive
daintiness had caused Soames in his Marlborough days to be the
first boy into white waistcoats in summer, and corduroy waistcoats
in winter, had prevented him from ever appearing in public with his
tie climbing up his collar, and induced him to dust his patent
leather boots before a great multitude assembled on Speech Day to
hear him recite Moliere.</p>

<p>Skin-like immaculateness had grown over Soames, as over many
Londoners; impossible to conceive of him with a hair out of place,
a tie deviating one-eighth of an inch from the perpendicular, a
collar unglossed! He would not have gone without a bath for
worlds&mdash;it was the fashion to take baths; and how bitter was
his scorn of people who omitted them!</p>

<p>But Irene could be imagined, like some nymph, bathing in wayside
streams, for the joy of the freshness and of seeing her own fair
body.</p>

<p>In this conflict throughout the house the woman had gone to the
wall. As in the struggle between Saxon and Celt still going on
within the nation, the more impressionable and receptive
temperament had had forced on it a conventional superstructure.</p>

<p>Thus the house had acquired a close resemblance to hundreds of
other houses with the same high aspirations, having become: 'That
very charming little house of the Soames Forsytes, quite
individual, my dear&mdash;really elegant.'</p>

<p>For Soames Forsyte&mdash;read James Peabody, Thomas Atkins, or
Emmanuel Spagnoletti, the name in fact of any upper-middle class
Englishman in London with any pretensions to taste; and though the
decoration be different, the phrase is just.</p>

<p>On the evening of August 8, a week after the expedition to Robin
Hill, in the dining-room of this house&mdash;'quite individual, my
dear&mdash;really elegant'&mdash;Soames and Irene were seated at
dinner. A hot dinner on Sundays was a little distinguishing
elegance common to this house and many others. Early in married
life Soames had laid down the rule: 'The servants must give us hot
dinner on Sundays&mdash;they've nothing to do but play the
concertina.'</p>

<p>The custom had produced no revolution. For&mdash;to Soames a
rather deplorable sign&mdash;servants were devoted to Irene, who,
in defiance of all safe tradition, appeared to recognise their
right to a share in the weaknesses of human nature.</p>

<p>The happy pair were seated, not opposite each other, but
rectangularly, at the handsome rosewood table; they dined without a
cloth&mdash;a distinguishing elegance&mdash;and so far had not
spoken a word.</p>

<p>Soames liked to talk during dinner about business, or what he
had been buying, and so long as he talked Irene's silence did not
distress him. This evening he had found it impossible to talk. The
decision to build had been weighing on his mind all the week, and
he had made up his mind to tell her.</p>

<p>His nervousness about this disclosure irritated him profoundly;
she had no business to make him feel like that&mdash;a wife and a
husband being one person. She had not looked at him once since they
sat down; and he wondered what on earth she had been thinking about
all the time. It was hard, when a man worked as he did, making
money for her&mdash;yes, and with an ache in his heart&mdash;that
she should sit there, looking&mdash;looking as if she saw the walls
of the room closing in. It was enough to make a man get up and
leave the table.</p>

<p>The light from the rose-shaded lamp fell on her neck and
arms&mdash;Soames liked her to dine in a low dress, it gave him an
inexpressible feeling of superiority to the majority of his
acquaintance, whose wives were contented with their best high
frocks or with tea-gowns, when they dined at home. Under that rosy
light her amber-coloured hair and fair skin made strange contrast
with her dark brown eyes.</p>

<p>Could a man own anything prettier than this dining-table with
its deep tints, the starry, soft-petalled roses, the ruby-coloured
glass, and quaint silver furnishing; could a man own anything
prettier than the woman who sat at it? Gratitude was no virtue
among Forsytes, who, competitive, and full of common-sense, had no
occasion for it; and Soames only experienced a sense of
exasperation amounting to pain, that he did not own her as it was
his right to own her, that he could not, as by stretching out his
hand to that rose, pluck her and sniff the very secrets of her
heart.</p>

<p>Out of his other property, out of all the things he had
collected, his silver, his pictures, his houses, his investments,
he got a secret and intimate feeling; out of her he got none.</p>

<p>In this house of his there was writing on every wall. His
business-like temperament protested against a mysterious warning
that she was not made for him. He had married this woman, conquered
her, made her his own, and it seemed to him contrary to the most
fundamental of all laws, the law of possession, that he could do no
more than own her body&mdash;if indeed he could do that, which he
was beginning to doubt. If any one had asked him if he wanted to
own her soul, the question would have seemed to him both ridiculous
and sentimental. But he did so want, and the writing said he never
would.</p>

<p>She was ever silent, passive, gracefully averse; as though
terrified lest by word, motion, or sign she might lead him to
believe that she was fond of him; and he asked himself: Must I
always go on like this?</p>

<p>Like most novel readers of his generation (and Soames was a
great novel reader), literature coloured his view of life; and he
had imbibed the belief that it was only a question of time.</p>

<p>In the end the husband always gained the affection of his wife.
Even in those cases&mdash;a class of book he was not very fond
of&mdash;which ended in tragedy, the wife always died with poignant
regrets on her lips, or if it were the husband who
died&mdash;unpleasant thought&mdash;threw herself on his body in an
agony of remorse.</p>

<p>He often took Irene to the theatre, instinctively choosing the
modern Society Plays with the modern Society conjugal problem, so
fortunately different from any conjugal problem in real life. He
found that they too always ended in the same way, even when there
was a lover in the case. While he was watching the play Soames
often sympathized with the lover; but before he reached home again,
driving with Irene in a hansom, he saw that this would not do, and
he was glad the play had ended as it had. There was one class of
husband that had just then come into fashion, the strong, rather
rough, but extremely sound man, who was peculiarly successful at
the end of the play; with this person Soames was really not in
sympathy, and had it not been for his own position, would have
expressed his disgust with the fellow. But he was so conscious of
how vital to himself was the necessity for being a successful, even
a 'strong,' husband, that he never spoke of a distaste born perhaps
by the perverse processes of Nature out of a secret fund of
brutality in himself.</p>

<p>But Irene's silence this evening was exceptional. He had never
before seen such an expression on her face. And since it is always
the unusual which alarms, Soames was alarmed. He ate his savoury,
and hurried the maid as she swept off the crumbs with the silver
sweeper. When she had left the room, he filled his glass with wine
and said:</p>

<p>"Anybody been here this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"June."</p>

<p>"What did she want?" It was an axiom with the Forsytes that
people did not go anywhere unless they wanted something. "Came to
talk about her lover, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Irene made no reply.</p>

<p>"It looks to me," continued Soames, "as if she were sweeter on
him than he is on her. She's always following him about."</p>

<p>Irene's eyes made him feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"You've no business to say such a thing!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Why not? Anybody can see it."</p>

<p>"They cannot. And if they could, it's disgraceful to say
so."</p>

<p>Soames's composure gave way.</p>

<p>"You're a pretty wife!" he said. But secretly he wondered at the
heat of her reply; it was unlike her. "You're cracked about June! I
can tell you one thing: now that she has the Buccaneer in tow, she
doesn't care twopence about you, and, you'll find it out. But you
won't see so much of her in future; we're going to live in the
country."</p>

<p>He had been glad to get his news out under cover of this burst
of irritation. He had expected a cry of dismay; the silence with
which his pronouncement was received alarmed him.</p>

<p>"You don't seem interested," he was obliged to add.</p>

<p>"I knew it already."</p>

<p>He looked at her sharply.</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"June."</p>

<p>"How did she know?"</p>

<p>Irene did not answer. Baffled and uncomfortable, he said:</p>

<p>"It's a fine thing for Bosinney, it'll be the making of him. I
suppose she's told you all about it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>There was another pause, and then Soames said:</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't want to, go?"</p>

<p>Irene made no reply.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't tell what you want. You never seem contented
here."</p>

<p>"Have my wishes anything to do with it?"</p>

<p>She took the vase of roses and left the room. Soames remained
seated. Was it for this that he had signed that contract? Was it
for this that he was going to spend some ten thousand pounds?
Bosinney's phrase came back to him: "Women are the devil!"</p>

<p>But presently he grew calmer. It might have, been worse. She
might have flared up. He had expected something more than this. It
was lucky, after all, that June had broken the ice for him. She
must have wormed it out of Bosinney; he might have known she
would.</p>

<p>He lighted his cigarette. After all, Irene had not made a scene!
She would come round&mdash;that was the best of her; she was cold,
but not sulky. And, puffing the cigarette smoke at a lady-bird on
the shining table, he plunged into a reverie about the house. It
was no good worrying; he would go and make it up presently. She
would be sitting out there in the dark, under the Japanese
sunshade, knitting. A beautiful, warm night...</p>

<p>In truth, June had come in that afternoon with shining eyes, and
the words: "Soames is a brick! It's splendid for Phil&mdash;the
very thing for him!"</p>

<p>Irene's face remaining dark and puzzled, she went on:</p>

<p>"Your new house at Robin Hill, of course. What? Don't you
know?"</p>

<p>Irene did not know.</p>

<p>"Oh! then, I suppose I oughtn't to have told you!" Looking
impatiently at her friend, she cried: "You look as if you didn't
care. Don't you see, it's what I've' been praying for&mdash;the
very chance he's been wanting all this time. Now you'll see what he
can do;" and thereupon she poured out the whole story.</p>

<p>Since her own engagement she had not seemed much interested in
her friend's position; the hours she spent with Irene were given to
confidences of her own; and at times, for all her affectionate
pity, it was impossible to keep out of her smile a trace of
compassionate contempt for the woman who had made such a mistake in
her life&mdash;such a vast, ridiculous mistake.</p>

<p>"He's to have all the decorations as well&mdash;a free hand.
It's perfect&mdash;" June broke into laughter, her little figure
quivered gleefully; she raised her hand, and struck a blow at a
muslin curtain. "Do you, know I even asked Uncle James..." But,
with a sudden dislike to mentioning that incident, she stopped; and
presently, finding her friend so unresponsive, went away. She
looked back from the pavement, and Irene was still standing in the
doorway. In response to her farewell wave, Irene put her hand to
her brow, and, turning slowly, shut the door...</p>

<p>Soames went to the drawing-room presently, and peered at her
through the window.</p>

<p>Out in the shadow of the Japanese sunshade she was sitting very
still, the lace on her white shoulders stirring with the soft rise
and fall of her bosom.</p>

<p>But about this silent creature sitting there so motionless, in
the dark, there seemed a warmth, a hidden fervour of feeling, as if
the whole of her being had been stirred, and some change were
taking place in its very depths.</p>

<p>He stole back to the dining-room unnoticed.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER VI&mdash;JAMES AT LARGE</h3>

<p>It was not long before Soames's determination to build went the
round of the family, and created the flutter that any decision
connected with property should make among Forsytes.</p>

<p>It was not his fault, for he had been determined that no one
should know. June, in the fulness of her heart, had told Mrs.
Small, giving her leave only to tell Aunt Ann&mdash;she thought it
would cheer her, the poor old sweet! for Aunt Ann had kept her room
now for many days.</p>

<p>Mrs. Small told Aunt Ann at once, who, smiling as she lay back
on her pillows, said in her distinct, trembling old voice:</p>

<p>"It's very nice for dear June; but I hope they will be
careful&mdash;it's rather dangerous!"</p>

<p>When she was left alone again, a frown, like a cloud presaging a
rainy morrow, crossed her face.</p>

<p>While she was lying there so many days the process of recharging
her will went on all the time; it spread to her face, too, and
tightening movements were always in action at the corners of her
lips.</p>

<p>The maid Smither, who had been in her service since girlhood,
and was spoken of as "Smither&mdash;a good girl&mdash;but so
slow!"&mdash;the maid Smither performed every morning with extreme
punctiliousness the crowning ceremony of that ancient toilet.
Taking from the recesses of their pure white band-box those flat,
grey curls, the insignia of personal dignity, she placed them
securely in her mistress's hands, and turned her back.</p>

<p>And every day Aunts Juley and Hester were required to come and
report on Timothy; what news there was of Nicholas; whether dear
June had succeeded in getting Jolyon to shorten the engagement, now
that Mr. Bosinney was building Soames a house; whether young
Roger's wife was really&mdash;expecting; how the operation on
Archie had succeeded; and what Swithin had done about that empty
house in Wigmore Street, where the tenant had lost all his money
and treated him so badly; above all, about Soames; was Irene
still&mdash;still asking for a separate room? And every morning
Smither was told: "I shall be coming down this afternoon, Smither,
about two o'clock. I shall want your arm, after all these days in
bed!"</p>

<p>After telling Aunt Ann, Mrs. Small had spoken of the house in
the strictest confidence to Mrs. Nicholas, who in her turn had
asked Winifred Dartie for confirmation, supposing, of course, that,
being Soames's sister, she would know all about it. Through her it
had in due course come round to the ears of James. He had been a
good deal agitated.</p>

<p>"Nobody," he said, "told him anything." And, rather than go
direct to Soames himself, of whose taciturnity he was afraid, he
took his umbrella and went round to Timothy's.</p>

<p>He found Mrs. Septimus and Hester (who had been told&mdash;she
was so safe, she found it tiring to talk) ready, and indeed eager,
to discuss the news. It was very good of dear Soames, they thought,
to employ Mr. Bosinney, but rather risky. What had George named
him? 'The Buccaneer' How droll! But George was always droll!
However, it would be all in the family they supposed they must
really look upon Mr. Bosinney as belonging to the family, though it
seemed strange.</p>

<p>James here broke in:</p>

<p>"Nobody knows anything about him. I don't see what Soames wants
with a young man like that. I shouldn't be surprised if Irene had
put her oar in. I shall speak to..."</p>

<p>"Soames," interposed Aunt Juley, "told Mr. Bosinney that he
didn't wish it mentioned. He wouldn't like it to be talked about,
I'm sure, and if Timothy knew he would be very vexed, I..."</p>

<p>James put his hand behind his ear:</p>

<p>"What?" he said. "I'm getting very deaf. I suppose I don't hear
people. Emily's got a bad toe. We shan't be able to start for Wales
till the end of the month. There's always something!" And, having
got what he wanted, he took his hat and went away.</p>

<p>It was a fine afternoon, and he walked across the Park towards
Soames's, where he intended to dine, for Emily's toe kept her in
bed, and Rachel and Cicely were on a visit to the country. He took
the slanting path from the Bayswater side of the Row to the
Knightsbridge Gate, across a pasture of short, burnt grass, dotted
with blackened sheep, strewn with seated couples and strange waifs;
lying prone on their faces, like corpses on a field over which the
wave of battle has rolled.</p>

<p>He walked rapidly, his head bent, looking neither to right nor,
left. The appearance of this park, the centre of his own
battle-field, where he had all his life been fighting, excited no
thought or speculation in his mind. These corpses flung down,
there, from out the press and turmoil of the struggle, these pairs
of lovers sitting cheek by jowl for an hour of idle Elysium
snatched from the monotony of their treadmill, awakened no fancies
in his mind; he had outlived that kind of imagination; his nose,
like the nose of a sheep, was fastened to the pastures on which he
browsed.</p>

<p>One of his tenants had lately shown a disposition to be
behind-hand in his rent, and it had become a grave question whether
he had not better turn him out at once, and so run the risk of not
re-letting before Christmas. Swithin had just been let in very
badly, but it had served him right&mdash;he had held on too
long.</p>

<p>He pondered this as he walked steadily, holding his umbrella
carefully by the wood, just below the crook of the handle, so as to
keep the ferule off the ground, and not fray the silk in the
middle. And, with his thin, high shoulders stooped, his long legs
moving with swift mechanical precision, this passage through the
Park, where the sun shone with a clear flame on so much
idleness&mdash;on so many human evidences of the remorseless battle
of Property, raging beyond its ring&mdash;was like the flight of
some land bird across the sea.</p>

<p>He felt a&mdash;touch on the arm as he came out at Albert
Gate.</p>

<p>It was Soames, who, crossing from the shady side of Piccadilly,
where he had been walking home from the office, had suddenly
appeared alongside.</p>

<p>"Your mother's in bed," said James; "I was, just coming to you,
but I suppose I shall be in the way."</p>

<p>The outward relations between James and his son were marked by a
lack of sentiment peculiarly Forsytean, but for all that the two
were by no means unattached. Perhaps they regarded one another as
an investment; certainly they were solicitous of each other's
welfare, glad of each other's company. They had never exchanged two
words upon the more intimate problems of life, or revealed in each
other's presence the existence of any deep feeling.</p>

<p>Something beyond the power of word-analysis bound them together,
something hidden deep in the fibre of nations and
families&mdash;for blood, they say, is thicker than water&mdash;and
neither of them was a cold-blooded man. Indeed, in James love of
his children was now the prime motive of his existence. To have
creatures who were parts of himself, to whom he might transmit the
money he saved, was at the root of his saving; and, at
seventy-five, what was left that could give him pleasure,
but&mdash;saving? The kernel of life was in this saving for his
children.</p>

<p>Than James Forsyte, notwithstanding all his 'Jonah-isms,' there
was no saner man (if the leading symptom of sanity, as we are told,
is self-preservation, though without doubt Timothy went too far) in
all this London, of which he owned so much, and loved with such a
dumb love, as the centre of his opportunities. He had the
marvellous instinctive sanity of the middle class. In
him&mdash;more than in Jolyon, with his masterful will and his
moments of tenderness and philosophy&mdash;more than in Swithin,
the martyr to crankiness&mdash;Nicholas, the sufferer from
ability&mdash;and Roger, the victim of enterprise&mdash;beat the
true pulse of compromise; of all the brothers he was least
remarkable in mind and person, and for that reason more likely to
live for ever.</p>

<p>To James, more than to any of the others, was "the family"
significant and dear. There had always been something primitive and
cosy in his attitude towards life; he loved the family hearth, he
loved gossip, and he loved grumbling. All his decisions were formed
of a cream which he skimmed off the family mind; and, through that
family, off the minds of thousands of other families of similar
fibre. Year after year, week after week, he went to Timothy's, and
in his brother's front drawing-room&mdash;his legs twisted, his
long white whiskers framing his clean-shaven mouth&mdash;would sit
watching the family pot simmer, the cream rising to the top; and he
would go away sheltered, refreshed, comforted, with an indefinable
sense of comfort.</p>

<p>Beneath the adamant of his self-preserving instinct there was
much real softness in James; a visit to Timothy's was like an hour
spent in the lap of a mother; and the deep craving he himself had
for the protection of the family wing reacted in turn on his
feelings towards his own children; it was a nightmare to him to
think of them exposed to the treatment of the world, in money,
health, or reputation. When his old friend John Street's son
volunteered for special service, he shook his head querulously, and
wondered what John Street was about to allow it; and when young
Street was assagaied, he took it so much to heart that he made a
point of calling everywhere with the special object of saying: He
knew how it would be&mdash;he'd no patience with them!</p>

<p>When his son-in-law Dartie had that financial crisis, due to
speculation in Oil Shares, James made himself ill worrying over it;
the knell of all prosperity seemed to have sounded. It took him
three months and a visit to Baden-Baden to get better; there was
something terrible in the idea that but for his, James's, money,
Dartie's name might have appeared in the Bankruptcy List.</p>

<p>Composed of a physiological mixture so sound that if he had an
earache he thought he was dying, he regarded the occasional
ailments of his wife and children as in the nature of personal
grievances, special interventions of Providence for the purpose of
destroying his peace of mind; but he did not believe at all in the
ailments of people outside his own immediate family, affirming them
in every case to be due to neglected liver.</p>

<p>His universal comment was: "What can they expect? I have it
myself, if I'm not careful!"</p>

<p>When he went to Soames's that evening he felt that life was hard
on him: There was Emily with a bad toe, and Rachel gadding about in
the country; he got no sympathy from anybody; and Ann, she was
ill&mdash;he did not believe she would last through the summer; he
had called there three times now without her being able to see him!
And this idea of Soames's, building a house, that would have to be
looked into. As to the trouble with Irene, he didn't know what was
to come of that&mdash;anything might come of it!</p>

<p>He entered 62, Montpellier Square with the fullest intentions of
being miserable. It was already half-past seven, and Irene, dressed
for dinner, was seated in the drawing-room. She was wearing her
gold-coloured frock&mdash;for, having been displayed at a
dinner-party, a soiree, and a dance, it was now to be worn at
home&mdash;and she had adorned the bosom with a cascade of lace, on
which James's eyes riveted themselves at once.</p>

<p>"Where do you get your things?" he said in an aggravated voice.
"I never see Rachel and Cicely looking half so well. That
rose-point, now&mdash;that's not real!"</p>

<p>Irene came close, to prove to him that he was in error.</p>

<p>And, in spite of himself, James felt the influence of her
deference, of the faint seductive perfume exhaling from her. No
self-respecting Forsyte surrendered at a blow; so he merely said:
He didn't know&mdash;he expected she was spending a pretty penny on
dress.</p>

<p>The gong sounded, and, putting her white arm within his, Irene
took him into the dining-room. She seated him in Soames's usual
place, round the corner on her left. The light fell softly there,
so that he would not be worried by the gradual dying of the day;
and she began to talk to him about himself.</p>

<p>Presently, over James came a change, like the mellowing that
steals upon a fruit in the sun; a sense of being caressed, and
praised, and petted, and all without the bestowal of a single
caress or word of praise. He felt that what he was eating was
agreeing with him; he could not get that feeling at home; he did
not know when he had enjoyed a glass of champagne so much, and, on
inquiring the brand and price, was surprised to find that it was
one of which he had a large stock himself, but could never drink;
he instantly formed the resolution to let his wine merchant know
that he had been swindled.</p>

<p>Looking up from his food, he remarked:</p>

<p>"You've a lot of nice things about the place. Now, what did you
give for that sugar-sifter? Shouldn't wonder if it was worth
money!"</p>

<p>He was particularly pleased with the appearance of a picture, on
the wall opposite, which he himself had given them:</p>

<p>"I'd no idea it was so good!" he said.</p>

<p>They rose to go into the drawing-room, and James followed Irene
closely.</p>

<p>"That's what I call a capital little dinner," he murmured,
breathing pleasantly down on her shoulder; "nothing heavy&mdash;and
not too Frenchified. But I can't get it at home. I pay my cook
sixty pounds a year, but she can't give me a dinner like that!"</p>

<p>He had as yet made no allusion to the building of the house, nor
did he when Soames, pleading the excuse of business, betook himself
to the room at the top, where he kept his pictures.</p>

<p>James was left alone with his daughter-in-law. The glow of the
wine, and of an excellent liqueur, was still within him. He felt
quite warm towards her. She was really a taking little thing; she
listened to you, and seemed to understand what you were saying;
and, while talking, he kept examining her figure, from her
bronze-coloured shoes to the waved gold of her hair. She was
leaning back in an Empire chair, her shoulders poised against the
top&mdash;her body, flexibly straight and unsupported from the
hips, swaying when she moved, as though giving to the arms of a
lover. Her lips were smiling, her eyes half-closed.</p>

<p>It may have been a recognition of danger in the very charm of
her attitude, or a twang of digestion, that caused a sudden
dumbness to fall on James. He did not remember ever having been
quite alone with Irene before. And, as he looked at her, an odd
feeling crept over him, as though he had come across something
strange and foreign.</p>

<p>Now what was she thinking about&mdash;sitting back like
that?</p>

<p>Thus when he spoke it was in a sharper voice, as if he had been
awakened from a pleasant dream.</p>

<p>"What d'you do with yourself all day?" he said. "You never come
round to Park Lane!"</p>

<p>She seemed to be making very lame excuses, and James did not
look at her. He did not want to believe that she was really
avoiding them&mdash;it would mean too much.</p>

<p>"I expect the fact is, you haven't time," he said; "You're
always about with June. I expect you're useful to her with her
young man, chaperoning, and one thing and another. They tell me
she's never at home now; your Uncle Jolyon he doesn't like it, I
fancy, being left so much alone as he is. They tell me she's always
hanging about for this young Bosinney; I suppose he comes here
every day. Now, what do you think of him? D'you think he knows his
own mind? He seems to me a poor thing. I should say the grey mare
was the better horse!"</p>

<p>The colour deepened in Irene's face; and James watched her
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't quite understand Mr. Bosinney," she said.</p>

<p>"Don't understand him!" James hummed out: "Why not?&mdash;you
can see he's one of these artistic chaps. They say he's
clever&mdash;they all think they're clever. You know more about him
than I do," he added; and again his suspicious glance rested on
her.</p>

<p>"He is designing a house for Soames," she said softly, evidently
trying to smooth things over.</p>

<p>"That brings me to what I was going to say," continued James; "I
don't know what Soames wants with a young man like that; why
doesn't he go to a first-rate man?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Bosinney is first-rate!"</p>

<p>James rose, and took a turn with bent head.</p>

<p>"That's it'," he said, "you young people, you all stick
together; you all think you know best!"</p>

<p>Halting his tall, lank figure before her, he raised a finger,
and levelled it at her bosom, as though bringing an indictment
against her beauty:</p>

<p>"All I can say is, these artistic people, or whatever they call
themselves, they're as unreliable as they can be; and my advice to
you is, don't you have too much to do with him!"</p>

<p>Irene smiled; and in the curve of her lips was a strange
provocation. She seemed to have lost her deference. Her breast rose
and fell as though with secret anger; she drew her hands inwards
from their rest on the arms of her chair until the tips of her
fingers met, and her dark eyes looked unfathomably at James.</p>

<p>The latter gloomily scrutinized the floor.</p>

<p>"I tell you my opinion," he said, "it's a pity you haven't got a
child to think about, and occupy you!"</p>

<p>A brooding look came instantly on Irene's face, and even James
became conscious of the rigidity that took possession of her whole
figure beneath the softness of its silk and lace clothing.</p>

<p>He was frightened by the effect he had produced, and like most
men with but little courage, he sought at once to justify himself
by bullying.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to care about going about. Why don't you drive
down to Hurlingham with us? And go to the theatre now and then. At
your time of life you ought to take an interest in things. You're a
young woman!"</p>

<p>The brooding look darkened on her face; he grew nervous.</p>

<p>"Well, I know nothing about it," he said; "nobody tells me
anything. Soames ought to be able to take care of himself. If he
can't take care of himself he mustn't look to me&mdash;that's
all."</p>

<p>Biting the corner of his forefinger he stole a cold, sharp look
at his daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>He encountered her eyes fixed on his own, so dark and deep, that
he stopped, and broke into a gentle perspiration.</p>

<p>"Well, I must be going," he said after a short pause, and a
minute later rose, with a slight appearance of surprise, as though
he had expected to be asked to stop. Giving his hand to Irene, he
allowed himself to be conducted to the door, and let out into the
street. He would not have a cab, he would walk, Irene was to say
good-night to Soames for him, and if she wanted a little gaiety,
well, he would drive her down to Richmond any day.</p>

<p>He walked home, and going upstairs, woke Emily out of the first
sleep she had had for four and twenty hours, to tell her that it
was his impression things were in a bad way at Soames's; on this
theme he descanted for half an hour, until at last, saying that he
would not sleep a wink, he turned on his side and instantly began
to snore.</p>

<p>In Montpellier Square Soames, who had come from the picture
room, stood invisible at the top of the stairs, watching Irene sort
the letters brought by the last post. She turned back into the
drawing-room; but in a minute came out, and stood as if listening.
Then she came stealing up the stairs, with a kitten in her arms. He
could see her face bent over the little beast, which was purring
against her neck. Why couldn't she look at him like that?</p>

<p>Suddenly she saw him, and her face changed.</p>

<p>"Any letters for me?" he said.</p>

<p>"Three."</p>

<p>He stood aside, and without another word she passed on into the
bedroom.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER VII&mdash;OLD JOLYON'S PECCADILLO</h3>

<p>Old Jolyon came out of Lord's cricket ground that same afternoon
with the intention of going home. He had not reached Hamilton
Terrace before he changed his mind, and hailing a cab, gave the
driver an address in Wistaria Avenue. He had taken a
resolution.</p>

<p>June had hardly been at home at all that week; she had given him
nothing of her company for a long time past, not, in fact, since
she had become engaged to Bosinney. He never asked her for her
company. It was not his habit to ask people for things! She had
just that one idea now&mdash;Bosinney and his affairs&mdash;and she
left him stranded in his great house, with a parcel of servants,
and not a soul to speak to from morning to night. His Club was
closed for cleaning; his Boards in recess; there was nothing,
therefore, to take him into the City. June had wanted him to go
away; she would not go herself, because Bosinney was in London.</p>

<p>But where was he to go by himself? He could not go abroad alone;
the sea upset his liver; he hated hotels. Roger went to a
hydropathic&mdash;he was not going to begin that at his time of
life, those new-fangled places we're all humbug!</p>

<p>With such formulas he clothed to himself the desolation of his
spirit; the lines down his face deepening, his eyes day by day
looking forth with the melancholy which sat so strangely on a face
wont to be strong and serene.</p>

<p>And so that afternoon he took this journey through St. John's
Wood, in the golden-light that sprinkled the rounded green bushes
of the acacia's before the little houses, in the summer sunshine
that seemed holding a revel over the little gardens; and he looked
about him with interest; for this was a district which no Forsyte
entered without open disapproval and secret curiosity.</p>

<p>His cab stopped in front of a small house of that peculiar buff
colour which implies a long immunity from paint. It had an outer
gate, and a rustic approach.</p>

<p>He stepped out, his bearing extremely composed; his massive
head, with its drooping moustache and wings of white hair, very
upright, under an excessively large top hat; his glance firm, a
little angry. He had been driven into this!</p>

<p>"Mrs. Jolyon Forsyte at home?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes sir!&mdash;what name shall I say, if you please,
sir?"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon could not help twinkling at the little maid as he
gave his name. She seemed to him such a funny little toad!</p>

<p>And he followed her through the dark hall, into a small double,
drawing-room, where the furniture was covered in chintz, and the
little maid placed him in a chair.</p>

<p>"They're all in the garden, sir; if you'll kindly take a seat,
I'll tell them."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon sat down in the chintz-covered chair, and looked
around him. The whole place seemed to him, as he would have
expressed it, pokey; there was a certain&mdash;he could not tell
exactly what&mdash;air of shabbiness, or rather of making two ends
meet, about everything. As far as he could see, not a single piece
of furniture was worth a five-pound note. The walls, distempered
rather a long time ago, were decorated with water-colour sketches;
across the ceiling meandered a long crack.</p>

<p>These little houses were all old, second-rate concerns; he
should hope the rent was under a hundred a year; it hurt him more
than he could have said, to think of a Forsyte&mdash;his own son
living in such a place.</p>

<p>The little maid came back. Would he please to go down into the
garden?</p>

<p>Old Jolyon marched out through the French windows. In descending
the steps he noticed that they wanted painting.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon, his wife, his two children, and his dog Balthasar,
were all out there under a pear-tree.</p>

<p>This walk towards them was the most courageous act of old
Jolyon's life; but no muscle of his face moved, no nervous gesture
betrayed him. He kept his deep-set eyes steadily on the enemy.</p>

<p>In those two minutes he demonstrated to perfection all that
unconscious soundness, balance, and vitality of fibre that made, of
him and so many others of his class the core of the nation. In the
unostentatious conduct of their own affairs, to the neglect of
everything else, they typified the essential individualism, born in
the Briton from the natural isolation of his country's life.</p>

<p>The dog Balthasar sniffed round the edges of his trousers; this
friendly and cynical mongrel&mdash;offspring of a liaison between a
Russian poodle and a fox-terrier&mdash;had a nose for the
unusual.</p>

<p>The strange greetings over, old Jolyon seated himself in a
wicker chair, and his two grandchildren, one on each side of his
knees, looked at him silently, never having seen so old a man.</p>

<p>They were unlike, as though recognising the difference set
between them by the circumstances of their births. Jolly, the child
of sin, pudgy-faced, with his tow-coloured hair brushed off his
forehead, and a dimple in his chin, had an air of stubborn
amiability, and the eyes of a Forsyte; little Holly, the child of
wedlock, was a dark-skinned, solemn soul, with her mother's, grey
and wistful eyes.</p>

<p>The dog Balthasar, having walked round the three small
flower-beds, to show his extreme contempt for things at large, had
also taken a seat in front of old Jolyon, and, oscillating a tail
curled by Nature tightly over his back, was staring up with eyes
that did not blink.</p>

<p>Even in the garden, that sense of things being pokey haunted old
Jolyon; the wicker chair creaked under his weight; the garden-beds
looked 'daverdy'; on the far side, under the smut-stained wall,
cats had made a path.</p>

<p>While he and his grandchildren thus regarded each other with the
peculiar scrutiny, curious yet trustful, that passes between the
very young and the very old, young Jolyon watched his wife.</p>

<p>The colour had deepened in her thin, oval face, with its
straight brows, and large, grey eyes. Her hair, brushed in fine,
high curves back from her forehead, was going grey, like his own,
and this greyness made the sudden vivid colour in her cheeks
painfully pathetic.</p>

<p>The look on her face, such as he had never seen there before,
such as she had always hidden from him, was full of secret
resentments, and longings, and fears. Her eyes, under their
twitching brows, stared painfully. And she was silent.</p>

<p>Jolly alone sustained the conversation; he had many possessions,
and was anxious that his unknown friend with extremely large
moustaches, and hands all covered with blue veins, who sat with
legs crossed like his own father (a habit he was himself trying to
acquire), should know it; but being a Forsyte, though not yet quite
eight years old, he made no mention of the thing at the moment
dearest to his heart&mdash;a camp of soldiers in a shop-window,
which his father had promised to buy. No doubt it seemed to him too
precious; a tempting of Providence to mention it yet.</p>

<p>And the sunlight played through the leaves on that little party
of the three generations grouped tranquilly under the pear-tree,
which had long borne no fruit.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon's furrowed face was reddening patchily, as old men's
faces redden in the sun. He took one of Jolly's hands in his own;
the boy climbed on to his knee; and little Holly, mesmerized by
this sight, crept up to them; the sound of the dog Balthasar's
scratching arose rhythmically.</p>

<p>Suddenly young Mrs. Jolyon got up and hurried indoors. A minute
later her husband muttered an excuse, and followed. Old Jolyon was
left alone with his grandchildren.</p>

<p>And Nature with her quaint irony began working in him one of her
strange revolutions, following her cyclic laws into the depths of
his heart. And that tenderness for little children, that passion
for the beginnings of life which had once made him forsake his son
and follow June, now worked in him to forsake June and follow these
littler things. Youth, like a flame, burned ever in his breast, and
to youth he turned, to the round little limbs, so reckless, that
wanted care, to the small round faces so unreasonably solemn or
bright, to the treble tongues, and the shrill, chuckling laughter,
to the insistent tugging hands, and the feel of small bodies
against his legs, to all that was young and young, and once more
young. And his eyes grew soft, his voice, and thin-veined hands
soft, and soft his heart within him. And to those small creatures
he became at once a place of pleasure, a place where they were
secure, and could talk and laugh and play; till, like sunshine,
there radiated from old Jolyon's wicker chair the perfect gaiety of
three hearts.</p>

<p>But with young Jolyon following to his wife's room it was
different.</p>

<p>He found her seated on a chair before her dressing-glass, with
her hands before her face.</p>

<p>Her shoulders were shaking with sobs. This passion of hers for
suffering was mysterious to him. He had been through a hundred of
these moods; how he had survived them he never knew, for he could
never believe they were moods, and that the last hour of his
partnership had not struck.</p>

<p>In the night she would be sure to throw her arms round his neck
and say: "Oh! Jo, how I make you suffer!" as she had done a hundred
times before.</p>

<p>He reached out his hand, and, unseen, slipped his razor-case
into his pocket. 'I cannot stay here,' he thought, 'I must go
down!' Without a word he left the room, and went back to the
lawn.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon had little Holly on his knee; she had taken
possession of his watch; Jolly, very red in the face, was trying to
show that he could stand on his head. The dog Balthasar, as close
as he might be to the tea-table, had fixed his eyes on the
cake.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon felt a malicious desire to cut their enjoyment
short.</p>

<p>What business had his father to come and upset his wife like
this? It was a shock, after all these years! He ought to have
known; he ought to have given them warning; but when did a Forsyte
ever imagine that his conduct could upset anybody! And in his
thoughts he did old Jolyon wrong.</p>

<p>He spoke sharply to the children, and told them to go in to
their tea. Greatly surprised, for they had never heard their father
speak sharply before, they went off, hand in hand, little Holly
looking back over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon poured out the tea.</p>

<p>"My wife's not the thing today," he said, but he knew well
enough that his father had penetrated the cause of that sudden
withdrawal, and almost hated the old man for sitting there so
calmly.</p>

<p>"You've got a nice little house here," said old Jolyon with a
shrewd look; "I suppose you've taken a lease of it!"</p>

<p>Young Jolyon nodded.</p>

<p>"I don't like the neighbourhood," said old Jolyon; "a ramshackle
lot."</p>

<p>Young Jolyon replied: "Yes, we're a ramshackle lot."'</p>

<p>The silence was now only broken by the sound of the dog
Balthasar's scratching.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon said simply: "I suppose I oughtn't to have come here,
Jo; but I get so lonely!"</p>

<p>At these words young Jolyon got up and put his hand on his
father's shoulder.</p>

<p>In the next house someone was playing over and over again: 'La
Donna mobile' on an untuned piano; and the little garden had fallen
into shade, the sun now only reached the wall at the end, whereon
basked a crouching cat, her yellow eyes turned sleepily down on the
dog Balthasar. There was a drowsy hum of very distant traffic; the
creepered trellis round the garden shut out everything but sky, and
house, and pear-tree, with its top branches still gilded by the
sun.</p>

<p>For some time they sat there, talking but little. Then old
Jolyon rose to go, and not a word was said about his coming
again.</p>

<p>He walked away very sadly. What a poor miserable place; and he
thought of the great, empty house in Stanhope Gate, fit residence
for a Forsyte, with its huge billiard-room and drawing-room that no
one entered from one week's end to another.</p>

<p>That woman, whose face he had rather liked, was too thin-skinned
by half; she gave Jo a bad time he knew! And those sweet children!
Ah! what a piece of awful folly!</p>

<p>He walked towards the Edgware Road, between rows of little
houses, all suggesting to him (erroneously no doubt, but the
prejudices of a Forsyte are sacred) shady histories of some sort or
kind.</p>

<p>Society, forsooth, the chattering hags and jackanapes&mdash;had
set themselves up to pass judgment on his flesh and blood! A parcel
of old women! He stumped his umbrella on the ground, as though to
drive it into the heart of that unfortunate body, which had dared
to ostracize his son and his son's son, in whom he could have lived
again!</p>

<p>He stumped his umbrella fiercely; yet he himself had followed
Society's behaviour for fifteen years&mdash;had only today been
false to it!</p>

<p>He thought of June, and her dead mother, and the whole story,
with all his old bitterness. A wretched business!</p>

<p>He was a long time reaching Stanhope Gate, for, with native
perversity, being extremely tired, he walked the whole way.</p>

<p>After washing his hands in the lavatory downstairs, he went to
the dining-room to wait for dinner, the only room he used when June
was out&mdash;it was less lonely so. The evening paper had not yet
come; he had finished the Times, there was therefore nothing to
do.</p>

<p>The room faced the backwater of traffic, and was very silent. He
disliked dogs, but a dog even would have been company. His gaze,
travelling round the walls, rested on a picture entitled: 'Group of
Dutch fishing boats at sunset'; the chef d'oeuvre of his
collection. It gave him no pleasure. He closed his eyes. He was
lonely! He oughtn't to complain, he knew, but he couldn't help it:
He was a poor thing&mdash;had always been a poor thing&mdash;no
pluck! Such was his thought.</p>

<p>The butler came to lay the table for dinner, and seeing his
master apparently asleep, exercised extreme caution in his
movements. This bearded man also wore a moustache, which had given
rise to grave doubts in the minds of many members&mdash;of the
family&mdash;, especially those who, like Soames, had been to
public schools, and were accustomed to niceness in such matters.
Could he really be considered a butler? Playful spirits alluded to
him as: 'Uncle Jolyon's Nonconformist'; George, the acknowledged
wag, had named him: 'Sankey.'</p>

<p>He moved to and fro between the great polished sideboard and the
great polished table inimitably sleek and soft.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon watched him, feigning sleep. The fellow was a
sneak&mdash;he had always thought so&mdash;who cared about nothing
but rattling through his work, and getting out to his betting or
his woman or goodness knew what! A slug! Fat too! And didn't care a
pin about his master!</p>

<p>But then against his will, came one of those moments of
philosophy which made old Jolyon different from other Forsytes:</p>

<p>After all why should the man care? He wasn't paid to care, and
why expect it? In this world people couldn't look for affection
unless they paid for it. It might be different in the next&mdash;he
didn't know&mdash;couldn't tell! And again he shut his eyes.</p>

<p>Relentless and stealthy, the butler pursued his labours, taking
things from the various compartments of the sideboard. His back
seemed always turned to old Jolyon; thus, he robbed his operations
of the unseemliness of being carried on in his master's presence;
now and then he furtively breathed on the silver, and wiped it with
a piece of chamois leather. He appeared to pore over the quantities
of wine in the decanters, which he carried carefully and rather
high, letting his heard droop over them protectingly. When he had
finished, he stood for over a minute watching his master, and in
his greenish eyes there was a look of contempt:</p>

<p>After all, this master of his was an old buffer, who hadn't much
left in him!</p>

<p>Soft as a tom-cat, he crossed the room to press the bell. His
orders were 'dinner at seven.' What if his master were asleep; he
would soon have him out of that; there was the night to sleep in!
He had himself to think of, for he was due at his Club at half-past
eight!</p>

<p>In answer to the ring, appeared a page boy with a silver soup
tureen. The butler took it from his hands and placed it on the
table, then, standing by the open door, as though about to usher
company into the room, he said in a solemn voice:</p>

<p>"Dinner is on the table, sir!"</p>

<p>Slowly old Jolyon got up out of his chair, and sat down at the
table to eat his dinner.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;PLANS OF THE HOUSE</h3>

<p>Forsytes, as is generally admitted, have shells, like that
extremely useful little animal which is made into Turkish delight,
in other words, they are never seen, or if seen would not be
recognised, without habitats, composed of circumstance, property,
acquaintances, and wives, which seem to move along with them in
their passage through a world composed of thousands of other
Forsytes with their habitats. Without a habitat a Forsyte is
inconceivable&mdash;he would be like a novel without a plot, which
is well-known to be an anomaly.</p>

<p>To Forsyte eyes Bosinney appeared to have no habitat, he seemed
one of those rare and unfortunate men who go through life
surrounded by circumstance, property, acquaintances, and wives that
do not belong to them.</p>

<p>His rooms in Sloane Street, on the top floor, outside which, on
a plate, was his name, 'Philip Baynes Bosinney, Architect,' were
not those of a Forsyte.&mdash;He had no sitting-room apart from his
office, but a large recess had been screened off to conceal the
necessaries of life&mdash;a couch, an easy chair, his pipes, spirit
case, novels and slippers. The business part of the room had the
usual furniture; an open cupboard with pigeon-holes, a round oak
table, a folding wash-stand, some hard chairs, a standing desk of
large dimensions covered with drawings and designs. June had twice
been to tea there under the chaperonage of his aunt.</p>

<p>He was believed to have a bedroom at the back.</p>

<p>As far as the family had been able to ascertain his income, it
consisted of two consulting appointments at twenty pounds a year,
together with an odd fee once in a way, and&mdash;more worthy
item&mdash;a private annuity under his father's will of one hundred
and fifty pounds a year.</p>

<p>What had transpired concerning that father was not so
reassuring. It appeared that he had been a Lincolnshire country
doctor of Cornish extraction, striking appearance, and Byronic
tendencies&mdash;a well-known figure, in fact, in his county.
Bosinney's uncle by marriage, Baynes, of Baynes and Bildeboy, a
Forsyte in instincts if not in name, had but little that was worthy
to relate of his brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"An odd fellow!' he would say: 'always spoke of his three eldest
boys as 'good creatures, but so dull'; they're all doing capitally
in the Indian Civil! Philip was the only one he liked. I've heard
him talk in the queerest way; he once said to me: 'My dear fellow,
never let your poor wife know what you're thinking of! But I didn't
follow his advice; not I! An eccentric man! He would say to Phil:
'Whether you live like a gentleman or not, my boy, be sure you die
like one! and he had himself embalmed in a frock coat suit, with a
satin cravat and a diamond pin. Oh, quite an original, I can assure
you!"</p>

<p>Of Bosinney himself Baynes would speak warmly, with a certain
compassion: "He's got a streak of his father's Byronism. Why, look
at the way he threw up his chances when he left my office; going
off like that for six months with a knapsack, and all for
what?&mdash;to study foreign architecture&mdash;foreign! What could
he expect? And there he is&mdash;a clever young
fellow&mdash;doesn't make his hundred a year! Now this engagement
is the best thing that could have happened&mdash;keep him steady;
he's one of those that go to bed all day and stay up all night,
simply because they've no method; but no vice about him&mdash;not
an ounce of vice. Old Forsyte's a rich man!"</p>

<p>Mr. Baynes made himself extremely pleasant to June, who
frequently visited his house in Lowndes Square at this period.</p>

<p>"This house of your cousin's&mdash;what a capital man of
business&mdash;is the very thing for Philip," he would say to her;
"you mustn't expect to see too much of him just now, my dear young
lady. The good cause&mdash;the good cause! The young man must make
his way. When I was his age I was at work day and night. My dear
wife used to say to me, 'Bobby, don't work too hard, think of your
health'; but I never spared myself!"</p>

<p>June had complained that her lover found no time to come to
Stanhope Gate.</p>

<p>The first time he came again they had not been together a
quarter of an hour before, by one of those coincidences of which
she was a mistress, Mrs. Septimus Small arrived. Thereon Bosinney
rose and hid himself, according to previous arrangement, in the
little study, to wait for her departure.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Aunt Juley, "how thin he is! I've often noticed
it with engaged people; but you mustn't let it get worse. There's
Barlow's extract of veal; it did your Uncle Swithin a lot of
good."</p>

<p>June, her little figure erect before the hearth, her small face
quivering grimly, for she regarded her aunt's untimely visit in the
light of a personal injury, replied with scorn:</p>

<p>"It's because he's busy; people who can do anything worth doing
are never fat!"</p>

<p>Aunt Juley pouted; she herself had always been thin, but the
only pleasure she derived from the fact was the opportunity of
longing to be stouter.</p>

<p>"I don't think," she said mournfully, "that you ought to let
them call him 'The Buccaneer'; people might think it odd, now that
he's going to build a house for Soames. I do hope he will be
careful; it's so important for him. Soames has such good
taste!"</p>

<p>"Taste!" cried June, flaring up at once; "wouldn't give that for
his taste, or any of the family's!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Small was taken aback.</p>

<p>"Your Uncle Swithin," she said, "always had beautiful taste! And
Soames's little house is lovely; you don't mean to say you don't
think so!"</p>

<p>"H'mph!" said June, "that's only because Irene's there!"</p>

<p>Aunt Juley tried to say something pleasant:</p>

<p>"And how will dear Irene like living in the country?"</p>

<p>June gazed at her intently, with a look in her eyes as if her
conscience had suddenly leaped up into them; it passed; and an even
more intent look took its place, as if she had stared that
conscience out of countenance. She replied imperiously:</p>

<p>"Of course she'll like it; why shouldn't she?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Small grew nervous.</p>

<p>"I didn't know," she said; "I thought she mightn't like to leave
her friends. Your Uncle James says she doesn't take enough interest
in life. We think&mdash;I mean Timothy thinks&mdash;she ought to go
out more. I expect you'll miss her very much!"</p>

<p>June clasped her hands behind her neck.</p>

<p>"I do wish," she cried, "Uncle Timothy wouldn't talk about what
doesn't concern him!"</p>

<p>Aunt Juley rose to the full height of her tall figure.</p>

<p>"He never talks about what doesn't concern him," she said.</p>

<p>June was instantly compunctious; she ran to her aunt and kissed
her.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, auntie; but I wish they'd let Irene alone."</p>

<p>Aunt Juley, unable to think of anything further on the subject
that would be suitable, was silent; she prepared for departure,
hooking her black silk cape across her chest, and, taking up her
green reticule:</p>

<p>"And how is your dear grandfather?" she asked in the hall, "I
expect he's very lonely now that all your time is taken up with Mr.
Bosinney."</p>

<p>She bent and kissed her niece hungrily, and with little, mincing
steps passed away.</p>

<p>The tears sprang up in June's eyes; running into the little
study, where Bosinney was sitting at the table drawing birds on the
back of an envelope, she sank down by his side and cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, Phil! it's all so horrid!" Her heart was as warm as the
colour of her hair.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday morning, while Soames was shaving, a
message was brought him to the effect that Mr. Bosinney was below,
and would be glad to see him. Opening the door into his wife's
room, he said:</p>

<p>"Bosinney's downstairs. Just go and entertain him while I finish
shaving. I'll be down in a minute. It's about the plans, I
expect."</p>

<p>Irene looked at him, without reply, put the finishing touch to
her dress and went downstairs. He could not make her out about this
house. She had said nothing against it, and, as far as Bosinney was
concerned, seemed friendly enough.</p>

<p>From the window of his dressing-room he could see them talking
together in the little court below. He hurried on with his shaving,
cutting his chin twice. He heard them laugh, and thought to
himself: "Well, they get on all right, anyway!"</p>

<p>As he expected, Bosinney had come round to fetch him to look at
the plans.</p>

<p>He took his hat and went over.</p>

<p>The plans were spread on the oak table in the architect's room;
and pale, imperturbable, inquiring, Soames bent over them for a
long time without speaking.</p>

<p>He said at last in a puzzled voice:</p>

<p>"It's an odd sort of house!"</p>

<p>A rectangular house of two stories was designed in a quadrangle
round a covered-in court. This court, encircled by a gallery on the
upper floor, was roofed with a glass roof, supported by eight
columns running up from the ground.</p>

<p>It was indeed, to Forsyte eyes, an odd house.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of room cut to waste," pursued Soames.</p>

<p>Bosinney began to walk about, and Soames did not like the
expression on his face.</p>

<p>"The principle of this house," said the architect, "was that you
should have room to breathe&mdash;like a gentleman!"</p>

<p>Soames extended his finger and thumb, as if measuring the extent
of the distinction he should acquire; and replied:</p>

<p>"Oh! yes; I see."</p>

<p>The peculiar look came into Bosinney's face which marked all his
enthusiasms.</p>

<p>"I've tried to plan you a house here with some self-respect of
its own. If you don't like it, you'd better say so. It's certainly
the last thing to be considered&mdash;who wants self-respect in a
house, when you can squeeze in an extra lavatory?" He put his
finger suddenly down on the left division of the centre oblong:
"You can swing a cat here. This is for your pictures, divided from
this court by curtains; draw them back and you'll have a space of
fifty-one by twenty-three six. This double-faced stove in the
centre, here, looks one way towards the court, one way towards the
picture room; this end wall is all window; You've a southeast light
from that, a north light from the court. The rest of your pictures
you can hang round the gallery upstairs, or in the other rooms.</p>

<p>"In architecture," he went on&mdash;and though looking at Soames
he did not seem to see him, which gave Soames an unpleasant
feeling&mdash;"as in life, you'll get no self-respect without
regularity. Fellows tell you that's old fashioned. It appears to be
peculiar any way; it never occurs to us to embody the main
principle of life in our buildings; we load our houses with
decoration, gimcracks, corners, anything to distract the eye. On
the contrary the eye should rest; get your effects with a few
strong lines. The whole thing is regularity there's no self-respect
without it."</p>

<p>Soames, the unconscious ironist, fixed his gaze on Bosinney's
tie, which was far from being in the perpendicular; he was unshaven
too, and his dress not remarkable for order. Architecture appeared
to have exhausted his regularity.</p>

<p>"Won't it look like a barrack?" he inquired.</p>

<p>He did not at once receive a reply.</p>

<p>"I can see what it is," said Bosinney, "you want one of
Littlemaster's houses&mdash;one of the pretty and commodious sort,
where the servants will live in garrets, and the front door be sunk
so that you may come up again. By all means try Littlemaster,
you'll find him a capital fellow, I've known him all my life!"</p>

<p>Soames was alarmed. He had really been struck by the plans, and
the concealment of his satisfaction had been merely instinctive. It
was difficult for him to pay a compliment. He despised people who
were lavish with their praises.</p>

<p>He found himself now in the embarrassing position of one who
must pay a compliment or run the risk of losing a good thing.
Bosinney was just the fellow who might tear up the plans and refuse
to act for him; a kind of grown-up child!</p>

<p>This grown-up childishness, to which he felt so superior,
exercised a peculiar and almost mesmeric effect on Soames, for he
had never felt anything like it in himself.</p>

<p>"Well," he stammered at last, "it's&mdash;it's, certainly
original."</p>

<p>He had such a private distrust and even dislike of the word
'original' that he felt he had not really given himself away by
this remark.</p>

<p>Bosinney seemed pleased. It was the sort of thing that would
please a fellow like that! And his success encouraged Soames.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;a big place," he said.</p>

<p>"Space, air, light," he heard Bosinney murmur, "you can't live
like a gentleman in one of Littlemaster's&mdash;he builds for
manufacturers."</p>

<p>Soames made a deprecating movement; he had been identified with
a gentleman; not for a good deal of money now would he be classed
with manufacturers. But his innate distrust of general principles
revived. What the deuce was the good of talking about regularity
and self-respect? It looked to him as if the house would be
cold.</p>

<p>"Irene can't stand the cold!" he said.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Bosinney sarcastically. "Your wife? She doesn't like
the cold? I'll see to that; she shan't be cold. Look here!" he
pointed, to four marks at regular intervals on the walls of the
court. "I've given you hot-water pipes in aluminium casings; you
can get them with very good designs."</p>

<p>Soames looked suspiciously at these marks.</p>

<p>"It's all very well, all this," he said, "but what's it going to
cost?"</p>

<p>The architect took a sheet of paper from his pocket:</p>

<p>"The house, of course, should be built entirely of stone, but,
as I thought you wouldn't stand that, I've compromised for a
facing. It ought to have a copper roof, but I've made it green
slate. As it is, including metal work, it'll cost you eight
thousand five hundred."</p>

<p>"Eight thousand five hundred?" said Soames. "Why, I gave you an
outside limit of eight!"</p>

<p>"Can't be done for a penny less," replied Bosinney coolly.</p>

<p>"You must take it or leave it!"</p>

<p>It was the only way, probably, that such a proposition could
have been made to Soames. He was nonplussed. Conscience told him to
throw the whole thing up. But the design was good, and he knew
it&mdash;there was completeness about it, and dignity; the
servants' apartments were excellent too. He would gain credit by
living in a house like that&mdash;with such individual features,
yet perfectly well-arranged.</p>

<p>He continued poring over the plans, while Bosinney went into his
bedroom to shave and dress.</p>

<p>The two walked back to Montpellier Square in silence, Soames
watching him out of the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>The Buccaneer was rather a good-looking fellow&mdash;so he
thought&mdash;when he was properly got up.</p>

<p>Irene was bending over her flowers when the two men came in.</p>

<p>She spoke of sending across the Park to fetch June.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Soames, "we've still got business to talk
over!"</p>

<p>At lunch he was almost cordial, and kept pressing Bosinney to
eat. He was pleased to see the architect in such high spirits, and
left him to spend the afternoon with Irene, while he stole off to
his pictures, after his Sunday habit. At tea-time he came down to
the drawing-room, and found them talking, as he expressed it,
nineteen to the dozen.</p>

<p>Unobserved in the doorway, he congratulated himself that things
were taking the right turn. It was lucky she and Bosinney got on;
she seemed to be falling into line with the idea of the new
house.</p>

<p>Quiet meditation among his pictures had decided him to spring
the five hundred if necessary; but he hoped that the afternoon
might have softened Bosinney's estimates. It was so purely a matter
which Bosinney could remedy if he liked; there must be a dozen ways
in which he could cheapen the production of a house without
spoiling the effect.</p>

<p>He awaited, therefore, his opportunity till Irene was handing
the architect his first cup of tea. A chink of sunshine through the
lace of the blinds warmed her cheek, shone in the gold of her hair,
and in her soft eyes. Possibly the same gleam deepened Bosinney's
colour, gave the rather startled look to his face.</p>

<p>Soames hated sunshine, and he at once got up, to draw the blind.
Then he took his own cup of tea from his wife, and said, more
coldly than he had intended:</p>

<p>"Can't you see your way to do it for eight thousand after all?
There must be a lot of little things you could alter."</p>

<p>Bosinney drank off his tea at a gulp, put down his cup, and
answered:</p>

<p>"Not one!"</p>

<p>Soames saw that his suggestion had touched some unintelligible
point of personal vanity.</p>

<p>"Well," he agreed, with sulky resignation; "you must have it
your own way, I suppose."</p>

<p>A few minutes later Bosinney rose to go, and Soames rose too, to
see him off the premises. The architect seemed in absurdly high
spirits. After watching him walk away at a swinging pace, Soames
returned moodily to the drawing-room, where Irene was putting away
the music, and, moved by an uncontrollable spasm of curiosity, he
asked:</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of 'The Buccaneer'?"</p>

<p>He looked at the carpet while waiting for her answer, and he had
to wait some time.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said at last.</p>

<p>"Do you think he's good-looking?"</p>

<p>Irene smiled. And it seemed to Soames that she was mocking
him.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered; "very."</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER IX&mdash;DEATH OF AUNT ANN</h3>

<p>There came a morning at the end of September when Aunt Ann was
unable to take from Smither's hands the insignia of personal
dignity. After one look at the old face, the doctor, hurriedly sent
for, announced that Miss Forsyte had passed away in her sleep.</p>

<p>Aunts Juley and Hester were overwhelmed by the shock. They had
never imagined such an ending. Indeed, it is doubtful whether they
had ever realized that an ending was bound to come. Secretly they
felt it unreasonable of Ann to have left them like this without a
word, without even a struggle. It was unlike her.</p>

<p>Perhaps what really affected them so profoundly was the thought
that a Forsyte should have let go her grasp on life. If one, then
why not all!</p>

<p>It was a full hour before they could make up their minds to tell
Timothy. If only it could be kept from him! If only it could be
broken to him by degrees!</p>

<p>And long they stood outside his door whispering together. And
when it was over they whispered together again.</p>

<p>He would feel it more, they were afraid, as time went on. Still,
he had taken it better than could have been expected. He would keep
his bed, of course!</p>

<p>They separated, crying quietly.</p>

<p>Aunt Juley stayed in her room, prostrated by the blow. Her face,
discoloured by tears, was divided into compartments by the little
ridges of pouting flesh which had swollen with emotion. It was
impossible to conceive of life without Ann, who had lived with her
for seventy-three years, broken only by the short interregnum of
her married life, which seemed now so unreal. At fixed intervals
she went to her drawer, and took from beneath the lavender bags a
fresh pocket-handkerchief. Her warm heart could not bear the
thought that Ann was lying there so cold.</p>

<p>Aunt Hester, the silent, the patient, that backwater of the
family energy, sat in the drawing-room, where the blinds were
drawn; and she, too, had wept at first, but quietly, without
visible effect. Her guiding principle, the conservation of energy,
did not abandon her in sorrow. She sat, slim, motionless, studying
the grate, her hands idle in the lap of her black silk dress. They
would want to rouse her into doing something, no doubt. As if there
were any good in that! Doing something would not bring back Ann!
Why worry her?</p>

<p>Five o'clock brought three of the brothers, Jolyon and James and
Swithin; Nicholas was at Yarmouth, and Roger had a bad attack of
gout. Mrs. Hayman had been by herself earlier in the day, and,
after seeing Ann, had gone away, leaving a message for
Timothy&mdash;which was kept from him&mdash;that she ought to have
been told sooner. In fact, there was a feeling amongst them all
that they ought to have been told sooner, as though they had missed
something; and James said:</p>

<p>"I knew how it'd be; I told you she wouldn't last through the
summer."</p>

<p>Aunt Hester made no reply; it was nearly October, but what was
the good of arguing; some people were never satisfied.</p>

<p>She sent up to tell her sister that the brothers were there.
Mrs. Small came down at once. She had bathed her face, which was
still swollen, and though she looked severely at Swithin's
trousers, for they were of light blue&mdash;he had come straight
from the club, where the news had reached him&mdash;she wore a more
cheerful expression than usual, the instinct for doing the wrong
thing being even now too strong for her.</p>

<p>Presently all five went up to look at the body. Under the pure
white sheet a quilted counter-pane had been placed, for now, more
than ever, Aunt Ann had need of warmth; and, the pillows removed,
her spine and head rested flat, with the semblance of their
life-long inflexibility; the coif banding the top of her brow was
drawn on either side to the level of the ears, and between it and
the sheet her face, almost as white, was turned with closed eyes to
the faces of her brothers and sisters. In its extraordinary peace
the face was stronger than ever, nearly all bone now under the
scarce-wrinkled parchment of skin&mdash;square jaw and chin,
cheekbones, forehead with hollow temples, chiselled nose&mdash;the
fortress of an unconquerable spirit that had yielded to death, and
in its upward sightlessness seemed trying to regain that spirit, to
regain the guardianship it had just laid down.</p>

<p>Swithin took but one look at the face, and left the room; the
sight, he said afterwards, made him very queer. He went downstairs
shaking the whole house, and, seizing his hat, clambered into his
brougham, without giving any directions to the coachman. He was
driven home, and all the evening sat in his chair without
moving.</p>

<p>He could take nothing for dinner but a partridge, with an
imperial pint of champagne...</p>

<p>Old Jolyon stood at the bottom of the bed, his hands folded in
front of him. He alone of those in the room remembered the death of
his mother, and though he looked at Ann, it was of that he was
thinking. Ann was an old woman, but death had come to her at
last&mdash;death came to all! His face did not move, his gaze
seemed travelling from very far.</p>

<p>Aunt Hester stood beside him. She did not cry now, tears were
exhausted&mdash;her nature refused to permit a further escape of
force; she twisted her hands, looking not at Ann, but from side to
side, seeking some way of escaping the effort of realization.</p>

<p>Of all the brothers and sisters James manifested the most
emotion. Tears rolled down the parallel furrows of his thin face;
where he should go now to tell his troubles he did not know; Juley
was no good, Hester worse than useless! He felt Ann's death more
than he had ever thought he should; this would upset him for
weeks!</p>

<p>Presently Aunt Hester stole out, and Aunt Juley began moving
about, doing 'what was necessary,' so that twice she knocked
against something. Old Jolyon, roused from his reverie, that
reverie of the long, long past, looked sternly at her, and went
away. James alone was left by the bedside; glancing stealthily
round, to see that he was not observed, he twisted his long body
down, placed a kiss on the dead forehead, then he, too, hastily
left the room. Encountering Smither in the hall, he began to ask
her about the funeral, and, finding that she knew nothing,
complained bitterly that, if they didn't take care, everything
would go wrong. She had better send for Mr. Soames&mdash;he knew
all about that sort of thing; her master was very much upset, he
supposed&mdash;he would want looking after; as for her mistresses,
they were no good&mdash;they had no gumption! They would be ill
too, he shouldn't wonder. She had better send for the doctor; it
was best to take things in time. He didn't think his sister Ann had
had the best opinion; if she'd had Blank she would have been alive
now. Smither might send to Park Lane any time she wanted advice. Of
course, his carriage was at their service for the funeral. He
supposed she hadn't such a thing as a glass of claret and a
biscuit&mdash;he had had no lunch!</p>

<p>The days before the funeral passed quietly. It had long been
known, of course, that Aunt Ann had left her little property to
Timothy. There was, therefore, no reason for the slightest
agitation. Soames, who was sole executor, took charge of all
arrangements, and in due course sent out the following invitation
to every male member of the family:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To...<br>
<br>
Your presence is requested at the funeral of Miss Ann Forsyte, in
Highgate Cemetery, at noon of Oct. 1st. Carriages will meet at "The
Bower," Bayswater Road, at 10.45. No flowers by request.
'R.S.V.P.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The morning came, cold, with a high, grey, London sky, and at
half-past ten the first carriage, that of James, drove up. It
contained James and his son-in-law Dartie, a fine man, with a
square chest, buttoned very tightly into a frock coat, and a
sallow, fattish face adorned with dark, well-curled moustaches, and
that incorrigible commencement of whisker which, eluding the
strictest attempts at shaving, seems the mark of something deeply
ingrained in the personality of the shaver, being especially
noticeable in men who speculate.</p>

<p>Soames, in his capacity of executor, received the guests, for
Timothy still kept his bed; he would get up after the funeral; and
Aunts Juley and Hester would not be coming down till all was over,
when it was understood there would be lunch for anyone who cared to
come back. The next to arrive was Roger, still limping from the
gout, and encircled by three of his sons&mdash;young Roger,
Eustace, and Thomas. George, the remaining son, arrived almost
immediately afterwards in a hansom, and paused in the hall to ask
Soames how he found undertaking pay.</p>

<p>They disliked each other.</p>

<p>Then came two Haymans&mdash;Giles and Jesse perfectly silent,
and very well dressed, with special creases down their evening
trousers. Then old Jolyon alone. Next, Nicholas, with a healthy
colour in his face, and a carefully veiled sprightliness in every
movement of his head and body. One of his sons followed him, meek
and subdued. Swithin Forsyte, and Bosinney arrived at the same
moment,&mdash;and stood&mdash;bowing precedence to each
other,&mdash;but on the door opening they tried to enter together;
they renewed their apologies in the hall, and, Swithin, settling
his stock, which had become disarranged in the struggle, very
slowly mounted the stairs. The other Hayman; two married sons of
Nicholas, together with Tweetyman, Spender, and Warry, the husbands
of married Forsyte and Hayman daughters. The company was then
complete, twenty-one in all, not a male member of the family being
absent but Timothy and young Jolyon.</p>

<p>Entering the scarlet and green drawing-room, whose apparel made
so vivid a setting for their unaccustomed costumes, each tried
nervously to find a seat, desirous of hiding the emphatic blackness
of his trousers. There seemed a sort of indecency in that blackness
and in the colour of their gloves&mdash;a sort of exaggeration of
the feelings; and many cast shocked looks of secret envy at 'the
Buccaneer,' who had no gloves, and was wearing grey trousers. A
subdued hum of conversation rose, no one speaking of the departed,
but each asking after the other, as though thereby casting an
indirect libation to this event, which they had come to honour.</p>

<p>And presently James said:</p>

<p>"Well, I think we ought to be starting."</p>

<p>They went downstairs, and, two and two, as they had been told
off in strict precedence, mounted the carriages.</p>

<p>The hearse started at a foot's pace; the carriages moved slowly
after. In the first went old Jolyon with Nicholas; in the second,
the twins, Swithin and James; in the third, Roger and young Roger;
Soames, young Nicholas, George, and Bosinney followed in the
fourth. Each of the other carriages, eight in all, held three or
four of the family; behind them came the doctor's brougham; then,
at a decent interval, cabs containing family clerks and servants;
and at the very end, one containing nobody at all, but bringing the
total cortege up to the number of thirteen.</p>

<p>So long as the procession kept to the highway of the Bayswater
Road, it retained the foot's-pace, but, turning into less important
thorough-fares, it soon broke into a trot, and so proceeded, with
intervals of walking in the more fashionable streets, until it
arrived. In the first carriage old Jolyon and Nicholas were talking
of their wills. In the second the twins, after a single attempt,
had lapsed into complete silence; both were rather deaf, and the
exertion of making themselves heard was too great. Only once James
broke this silence:</p>

<p>"I shall have to be looking about for some ground somewhere.
What arrangements have you made, Swithin?"</p>

<p>And Swithin, fixing him with a dreadful stare, answered:</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me about such things!"</p>

<p>In the third carriage a disjointed conversation was carried on
in the intervals of looking out to see how far they had got, George
remarking, "Well, it was really time that the poor old lady went."
He didn't believe in people living beyond seventy, Young Nicholas
replied mildly that the rule didn't seem to apply to the Forsytes.
George said he himself intended to commit suicide at sixty. Young
Nicholas, smiling and stroking a long chin, didn't think his father
would like that theory; he had made a lot of money since he was
sixty. Well, seventy was the outside limit; it was then time,
George said, for them to go and leave their money to their
children. Soames, hitherto silent, here joined in; he had not
forgotten the remark about the 'undertaking,' and, lifting his
eyelids almost imperceptibly, said it was all very well for people
who never made money to talk. He himself intended to live as long
as he could. This was a hit at George, who was notoriously hard up.
Bosinney muttered abstractedly "Hear, hear!" and, George yawning,
the conversation dropped.</p>

<p>Upon arriving, the coffin was borne into the chapel, and, two by
two, the mourners filed in behind it. This guard of men, all
attached to the dead by the bond of kinship, was an impressive and
singular sight in the great city of London, with its overwhelming
diversity of life, its innumerable vocations, pleasures, duties,
its terrible hardness, its terrible call to individualism.</p>

<p>The family had gathered to triumph over all this, to give a show
of tenacious unity, to illustrate gloriously that law of property
underlying the growth of their tree, by which it had thriven and
spread, trunk and branches, the sap flowing through all, the full
growth reached at the appointed time. The spirit of the old woman
lying in her last sleep had called them to this demonstration. It
was her final appeal to that unity which had been their
strength&mdash;it was her final triumph that she had died while the
tree was yet whole.</p>

<p>She was spared the watching of the branches jut out beyond the
point of balance. She could not look into the hearts of her
followers. The same law that had worked in her, bringing her up
from a tall, straight-backed slip of a girl to a woman strong and
grown, from a woman grown to a woman old, angular, feeble, almost
witchlike, with individuality all sharpened and sharpened, as all
rounding from the world's contact fell off from her&mdash;that same
law would work, was working, in the family she had watched like a
mother.</p>

<p>She had seen it young, and growing, she had seen it strong and
grown, and before her old eyes had time or strength to see any
more, she died. She would have tried, and who knows but she might
have kept it young and strong, with her old fingers, her trembling
kisses&mdash;a little longer; alas! not even Aunt Ann could fight
with Nature.</p>

<p>'Pride comes before a fall!' In accordance with this, the
greatest of Nature's ironies, the Forsyte family had gathered for a
last proud pageant before they fell. Their faces to right and left,
in single lines, were turned for the most part impassively toward
the ground, guardians of their thoughts; but here and there, one
looking upward, with a line between his brows, searched to see some
sight on the chapel walls too much for him, to be listening to
something that appalled. And the responses, low-muttered, in voices
through which rose the same tone, the same unseizable family ring,
sounded weird, as though murmured in hurried duplication by a
single person.</p>

<p>The service in the chapel over, the mourners filed up again to
guard the body to the tomb. The vault stood open, and, round it,
men in black were waiting.</p>

<p>From that high and sacred field, where thousands of the upper
middle class lay in their last sleep, the eyes of the Forsytes
travelled down across the flocks of graves. There&mdash;spreading
to the distance, lay London, with no sun over it, mourning the loss
of its daughter, mourning with this family, so dear, the loss of
her who was mother and guardian. A hundred thousand spires and
houses, blurred in the great grey web of property, lay there like
prostrate worshippers before the grave of this, the oldest Forsyte
of them all.</p>

<p>A few words, a sprinkle of earth, the thrusting of the coffin
home, and Aunt Ann had passed to her last rest.</p>

<p>Round the vault, trustees of that passing, the five brothers
stood, with white heads bowed; they would see that Ann was
comfortable where she was going. Her little property must stay
behind, but otherwise, all that could be should be done... Then
severally, each stood aside, and putting on his hat, turned back to
inspect the new inscription on the marble of the family vault:</p>

<blockquote>SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ANN FORSYTE, THE DAUGHTER OF
THE ABOVE JOLYON AND ANN FORSYTE, WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE THE 27TH
DAY OF SEPTEMBER, 1886, AGED EIGHTY-SEVEN YEARS AND FOUR
DAYS</blockquote>

<p>Soon perhaps, someone else would be wanting an inscription. It
was strange and intolerable, for they had not thought somehow, that
Forsytes could die. And one and all they had a longing to get away
from this painfulness, this ceremony which had reminded them of
things they could not bear to think about&mdash;to get away quickly
and go about their business and forget.</p>

<p>It was cold, too; the wind, like some slow, disintegrating
force, blowing up the hill over the graves, struck them with its
chilly breath; they began to split into groups, and as quickly as
possible to fill the waiting carriages.</p>

<p>Swithin said he should go back to lunch at Timothy's, and he
offered to take anybody with him in his brougham. It was considered
a doubtful privilege to drive with Swithin in his brougham, which
was not a large one; nobody accepted, and he went off alone. James
and Roger followed immediately after; they also would drop in to
lunch. The others gradually melted away, Old Jolyon taking three
nephews to fill up his carriage; he had a want of those young
faces.</p>

<p>Soames, who had to arrange some details in the cemetery office,
walked away with Bosinney. He had much to talk over with him, and,
having finished his business, they strolled to Hampstead, lunched
together at the Spaniard's Inn, and spent a long time in going into
practical details connected with the building of the house; they
then proceeded to the tram-line, and came as far as the Marble
Arch, where Bosinney went off to Stanhope Gate to see June.</p>

<p>Soames felt in excellent spirits when he arrived home, and
confided to Irene at dinner that he had had a good talk with
Bosinney, who really seemed a sensible fellow; they had had a
capital walk too, which had done his liver good&mdash;he had been
short of exercise for a long time&mdash;and altogether a very
satisfactory day. If only it hadn't been for poor Aunt Ann, he
would have taken her to the theatre; as it was, they must make the
best of an evening at home.</p>

<p>"The Buccaneer asked after you more than once," he said
suddenly. And moved by some inexplicable desire to assert his
proprietorship, he rose from his chair and planted a kiss on his
wife's shoulder.</p>

<hr>

<h2>PART II</h2>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER I&mdash;PROGRESS OF THE HOUSE</h3>

<p>The winter had been an open one. Things in the trade were slack;
and as Soames had reflected before making up his mind, it had been
a good time for building. The shell of the house at Robin Hill was
thus completed by the end of April.</p>

<p>Now that there was something to be seen for his money, he had
been coming down once, twice, even three times a week, and would
mouse about among the debris for hours, careful never to soil his
clothes, moving silently through the unfinished brickwork of
doorways, or circling round the columns in the central court.</p>

<p>And he would stand before them for minutes' together, as though
peering into the real quality of their substance.</p>

<p>On April 30 he had an appointment with Bosinney to go over the
accounts, and five minutes before the proper time he entered the
tent which the architect had pitched for himself close to the old
oak tree.</p>

<p>The accounts were already prepared on a folding table, and with
a nod Soames sat down to study them. It was some time before he
raised his head.</p>

<p>"I can't make them out," he said at last; "they come to nearly
seven hundred more than they ought."</p>

<p>After a glance at Bosinney's face he went on quickly:</p>

<p>"If you only make a firm stand against these builder chaps
you'll get them down. They stick you with everything if you don't
look sharp...Take ten per cent. off all round. I shan't mind it's
coming out a hundred or so over the mark!"</p>

<p>Bosinney shook his head:</p>

<p>"I've taken off every farthing I can!"</p>

<p>Soames pushed back the table with a movement of anger, which
sent the account sheets fluttering to the ground.</p>

<p>"Then all I can say is," he flustered out, "you've made a pretty
mess of it!"</p>

<p>"I've told you a dozen times," Bosinney answered sharply, "that
there'd be extras. I've pointed them out to you over and over
again!"</p>

<p>"I know that," growled Soames: "I shouldn't have objected to a
ten pound note here and there. How was I to know that by 'extras'
you meant seven hundred pounds?"</p>

<p>The qualities of both men had contributed to this
not-inconsiderable discrepancy. On the one hand, the architect's
devotion to his idea, to the image of a house which he had created
and believed in&mdash;had made him nervous of being stopped, or
forced to the use of makeshifts; on the other, Soames' not less
true and wholehearted devotion to the very best article that could
be obtained for the money, had rendered him averse to believing
that things worth thirteen shillings could not be bought with
twelve.</p>

<p>"I wish I'd never undertaken your house," said Bosinney
suddenly. "You come down here worrying me out of my life. You want
double the value for your money anybody else would, and now that
you've got a house that for its size is not to be beaten in the
county, you don't want to pay for it. If you're anxious to be off
your bargain, I daresay I can find the balance above the estimates
myself, but I'm d&mdash;&mdash;d if I do another stroke of work for
you!"</p>

<p>Soames regained his composure. Knowing that Bosinney had no
capital, he regarded this as a wild suggestion. He saw, too, that
he would be kept indefinitely out of this house on which he had set
his heart, and just at the crucial point when the architect's
personal care made all the difference. In the meantime there was
Irene to be thought of! She had been very queer lately. He really
believed it was only because she had taken to Bosinney that she
tolerated the idea of the house at all. It would not do to make an
open breach with her.</p>

<p>"You needn't get into a rage," he said. "If I'm willing to put
up with it, I suppose you needn't cry out. All I meant was that
when you tell me a thing is going to cost so much, I like
to&mdash;well, in fact, I&mdash;like to know where I am."</p>

<p>"Look here!" said Bosinney, and Soames was both annoyed and
surprised by the shrewdness of his glance. "You've got my services
dirt cheap. For the kind of work I've put into this house, and the
amount of time I've given to it, you'd have had to pay Littlemaster
or some other fool four times as much. What you want, in fact, is a
first-rate man for a fourth-rate fee, and that's exactly what
you've got!"</p>

<p>Soames saw that he really meant what he said, and, angry though
he was, the consequences of a row rose before him too vividly. He
saw his house unfinished, his wife rebellious, himself a
laughingstock.</p>

<p>"Let's go over it," he said sulkily, "and see how the money's
gone."</p>

<p>"Very well," assented Bosinney. "But we'll hurry up, if you
don't mind. I have to get back in time to take June to the
theatre."</p>

<p>Soames cast a stealthy look at him, and said: "Coming to our
place, I suppose to meet her?" He was always coming to their
place!</p>

<p>There had been rain the night before-a spring rain, and the
earth smelt of sap and wild grasses. The warm, soft breeze swung
the leaves and the golden buds of the old oak tree, and in the
sunshine the blackbirds were whistling their hearts out.</p>

<p>It was such a spring day as breathes into a man an ineffable
yearning, a painful sweetness, a longing that makes him stand
motionless, looking at the leaves or grass, and fling out his arms
to embrace he knows not what. The earth gave forth a fainting
warmth, stealing up through the chilly garment in which winter had
wrapped her. It was her long caress of invitation, to draw men down
to lie within her arms, to roll their bodies on her, and put their
lips to her breast.</p>

<p>On just such a day as this Soames had got from Irene the promise
he had asked her for so often. Seated on the fallen trunk of a
tree, he had promised for the twentieth time that if their marriage
were not a success, she should be as free as if she had never
married him!</p>

<p>"Do you swear it?" she had said. A few days back she had
reminded him of that oath. He had answered: "Nonsense! I couldn't
have sworn any such thing!" By some awkward fatality he remembered
it now. What queer things men would swear for the sake of women! He
would have sworn it at any time to gain her! He would swear it now,
if thereby he could touch her&mdash;but nobody could touch her, she
was cold-hearted!</p>

<p>And memories crowded on him with the fresh, sweet savour of the
spring wind-memories of his courtship.</p>

<p>In the spring of the year 1881 he was visiting his old
school-fellow and client, George Liversedge, of Branksome, who,
with the view of developing his pine-woods in the neighbourhood of
Bournemouth, had placed the formation of the company necessary to
the scheme in Soames's hands. Mrs. Liversedge, with a sense of the
fitness of things, had given a musical tea in his honour. Later in
the course of this function, which Soames, no musician, had
regarded as an unmitigated bore, his eye had been caught by the
face of a girl dressed in mourning, standing by herself. The lines
of her tall, as yet rather thin figure, showed through the wispy,
clinging stuff of her black dress, her black-gloved hands were
crossed in front of her, her lips slightly parted, and her large,
dark eyes wandered from face to face. Her hair, done low on her
neck, seemed to gleam above her black collar like coils of shining
metal. And as Soames stood looking at her, the sensation that most
men have felt at one time or another went stealing through
him&mdash;a peculiar satisfaction of the senses, a peculiar
certainty, which novelists and old ladies call love at first sight.
Still stealthily watching her, he at once made his way to his
hostess, and stood doggedly waiting for the music to cease.</p>

<p>"Who is that girl with yellow hair and dark eyes?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That&mdash;oh! Irene Heron. Her father, Professor Heron, died
this year. She lives with her stepmother. She's a nice girl, a
pretty girl, but no money!"</p>

<p>"Introduce me, please," said Soames.</p>

<p>It was very little that he found to say, nor did he find her
responsive to that little. But he went away with the resolution to
see her again. He effected his object by chance, meeting her on the
pier with her stepmother, who had the habit of walking there from
twelve to one of a forenoon. Soames made this lady's acquaintance
with alacrity, nor was it long before he perceived in her the ally
he was looking for. His keen scent for the commercial side of
family life soon told him that Irene cost her stepmother more than
the fifty pounds a year she brought her; it also told him that Mrs.
Heron, a woman yet in the prime of life, desired to be married
again. The strange ripening beauty of her stepdaughter stood in the
way of this desirable consummation. And Soames, in his stealthy
tenacity, laid his plans.</p>

<p>He left Bournemouth without having given himself away, but in a
month's time came back, and this time he spoke, not to the girl,
but to her stepmother. He had made up his mind, he said; he would
wait any time. And he had long to wait, watching Irene bloom, the
lines of her young figure softening, the stronger blood deepening
the gleam of her eyes, and warming her face to a creamy glow; and
at each visit he proposed to her, and when that visit was at an
end, took her refusal away with him, back to London, sore at heart,
but steadfast and silent as the grave. He tried to come at the
secret springs of her resistance; only once had he a gleam of
light. It was at one of those assembly dances, which afford the
only outlet to the passions of the population of seaside
watering-places. He was sitting with her in an embrasure, his
senses tingling with the contact of the waltz. She had looked at
him over her, slowly waving fan; and he had lost his head. Seizing
that moving wrist, he pressed his lips to the flesh of her arm. And
she had shuddered&mdash;to this day he had not forgotten that
shudder&mdash;nor the look so passionately averse she had given
him.</p>

<p>A year after that she had yielded. What had made her yield he
could never make out; and from Mrs. Heron, a woman of some
diplomatic talent, he learnt nothing. Once after they were married
he asked her, "What made you refuse me so often?" She had answered
by a strange silence. An enigma to him from the day that he first
saw her, she was an enigma to him still...</p>

<p>Bosinney was waiting for him at the door; and on his rugged,
good-looking, face was a queer, yearning, yet happy look, as though
he too saw a promise of bliss in the spring sky, sniffed a coming
happiness in the spring air. Soames looked at him waiting there.
What was the matter with the fellow that he looked so happy? What
was he waiting for with that smile on his lips and in his eyes?
Soames could not see that for which Bosinney was waiting as he
stood there drinking in the flower-scented wind. And once more he
felt baffled in the presence of this man whom by habit he despised.
He hastened on to the house.</p>

<p>"The only colour for those tiles," he heard Bosinney
say,&mdash;"is ruby with a grey tint in the stuff, to give a
transparent effect. I should like Irene's opinion. I'm ordering the
purple leather curtains for the doorway of this court; and if you
distemper the drawing-room ivory cream over paper, you'll get an
illusive look. You want to aim all through the decorations at what
I call charm."</p>

<p>Soames said: "You mean that my wife has charm!"</p>

<p>Bosinney evaded the question.</p>

<p>"You should have a clump of iris plants in the centre of that
court."</p>

<p>Soames smiled superciliously.</p>

<p>"I'll look into Beech's some time," he said, "and see what's
appropriate!"</p>

<p>They found little else to say to each other, but on the way to
the Station Soames asked:</p>

<p>"I suppose you find Irene very artistic."</p>

<p>"Yes." The abrupt answer was as distinct a snub as saying: "If
you want to discuss her you can do it with someone else!"</p>

<p>And the slow, sulky anger Soames had felt all the afternoon
burned the brighter within him.</p>

<p>Neither spoke again till they were close to the Station, then
Soames asked:</p>

<p>"When do you expect to have finished?"</p>

<p>"By the end of June, if you really wish me to decorate as
well."</p>

<p>Soames nodded. "But you quite understand," he said, "that the
house is costing me a lot beyond what I contemplated. I may as well
tell you that I should have thrown it up, only I'm not in the habit
of giving up what I've set my mind on."</p>

<p>Bosinney made no reply. And Soames gave him askance a look of
dogged dislike&mdash;for in spite of his fastidious air and that
supercilious, dandified taciturnity, Soames, with his set lips and
squared chin, was not unlike a bulldog...</p>

<p>When, at seven o'clock that evening, June arrived at 62,
Montpellier Square, the maid Bilson told her that Mr. Bosinney was
in the drawing-room; the mistress&mdash;she said&mdash;was
dressing, and would be down in a minute. She would tell her that
Miss June was here.</p>

<p>June stopped her at once.</p>

<p>"All right, Bilson," she said, "I'll just go in. You, needn't
hurry Mrs. Soames."</p>

<p>She took off her cloak, and Bilson, with an understanding look,
did not even open the drawing-room door for her, but ran
downstairs.</p>

<p>June paused for a moment to look at herself in the little
old-fashioned silver mirror above the oaken rug chest&mdash;a slim,
imperious young figure, with a small resolute face, in a white
frock, cut moon-shaped at the base of a neck too slender for her
crown of twisted red-gold hair.</p>

<p>She opened the drawing-room door softly, meaning to take him by
surprise. The room was filled with a sweet hot scent of flowering
azaleas.</p>

<p>She took a long breath of the perfume, and heard Bosinney's
voice, not in the room, but quite close, saying.</p>

<p>"Ah! there were such heaps of things I wanted to talk about, and
now we shan't have time!"</p>

<p>Irene's voice answered: "Why not at dinner?"</p>

<p>"How can one talk..."</p>

<p>June's first thought was to go away, but instead she crossed to
the long window opening on the little court. It was from there that
the scent of the azaleas came, and, standing with their backs to
her, their faces buried in the golden-pink blossoms, stood her
lover and Irene.</p>

<p>Silent but unashamed, with flaming cheeks and angry eyes, the
girl watched.</p>

<p>"Come on Sunday by yourself&mdash;We can go over the house
together."</p>

<p>June saw Irene look up at him through her screen of blossoms. It
was not the look of a coquette, but&mdash;far worse to the watching
girl&mdash;of a woman fearful lest that look should say too
much.</p>

<p>"I've promised to go for a drive with Uncle..."</p>

<p>"The big one! Make him bring you; it's only ten miles&mdash;the
very thing for his horses."</p>

<p>"Poor old Uncle Swithin!"</p>

<p>A wave of the azalea scent drifted into June's face; she felt
sick and dizzy.</p>

<p>"Do! ah! do!"</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"I must see you there&mdash;I thought you'd like to help
me..."</p>

<p>The answer seemed to the girl to come softly with a tremble from
amongst the blossoms: "So I do!"</p>

<p>And she stepped into the open space of the window.</p>

<p>"How stuffy it is here!" she said; "I can't bear this
scent!"</p>

<p>Her eyes, so angry and direct, swept both their faces.</p>

<p>"Were you talking about the house? I haven't seen it yet, you
know&mdash;shall we all go on Sunday?"'</p>

<p>From Irene's face the colour had flown.</p>

<p>"I am going for a drive that day with Uncle Swithin," she
answered.</p>

<p>"Uncle Swithin! What does he matter? You can throw him
over!"</p>

<p>"I am not in the habit of throwing people over!"</p>

<p>There was a sound of footsteps and June saw Soames standing just
behind her.</p>

<p>"Well! if you are all ready," said Irene, looking from one to
the other with a strange smile, "dinner is too!"</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER II&mdash;JUNE'S TREAT</h3>

<p>Dinner began in silence; the women facing one another, and the
men.</p>

<p>In silence the soup was finished&mdash;excellent, if a little
thick; and fish was brought. In silence it was handed.</p>

<p>Bosinney ventured: "It's the first spring day."</p>

<p>Irene echoed softly: "Yes&mdash;the first spring day."</p>

<p>"Spring!" said June: "there isn't a breath of air!" No one
replied.</p>

<p>The fish was taken away, a fine fresh sole from Dover. And
Bilson brought champagne, a bottle swathed around the neck with
white...</p>

<p>Soames said: "You'll find it dry."</p>

<p>Cutlets were handed, each pink-frilled about the legs. They were
refused by June, and silence fell.</p>

<p>Soames said: "You'd better take a cutlet, June; there's nothing
coming."</p>

<p>But June again refused, so they were borne away. And then Irene
asked: "Phil, have you heard my blackbird?"</p>

<p>Bosinney answered: "Rather&mdash;he's got a hunting-song. As I
came round I heard him in the Square."</p>

<p>"He's such a darling!"</p>

<p>"Salad, sir?" Spring chicken was removed.</p>

<p>But Soames was speaking: "The asparagus is very poor. Bosinney,
glass of sherry with your sweet? June, you're drinking
nothing!"</p>

<p>June said: "You know I never do. Wine's such horrid stuff!"</p>

<p>An apple charlotte came upon a silver dish, and smilingly Irene
said: "The azaleas are so wonderful this year!"</p>

<p>To this Bosinney murmured: "Wonderful! The scent's
extraordinary!"</p>

<p>June said: "How can you like the scent? Sugar, please,
Bilson."</p>

<p>Sugar was handed her, and Soames remarked: "This charlottes
good!"</p>

<p>The charlotte was removed. Long silence followed. Irene,
beckoning, said: "Take out the azalea, Bilson. Miss June can't bear
the scent."</p>

<p>"No; let it stay," said June.</p>

<p>Olives from France, with Russian caviare, were placed on little
plates. And Soames remarked: "Why can't we have the Spanish?" But
no one answered.</p>

<p>The olives were removed. Lifting her tumbler June demanded:
"Give me some water, please." Water was given her. A silver tray
was brought, with German plums. There was a lengthy pause. In
perfect harmony all were eating them.</p>

<p>Bosinney counted up the stones: "This year&mdash;next
year&mdash;some time."</p>

<p>Irene finished softly: "Never! There was such a glorious sunset.
The sky's all ruby still&mdash;so beautiful!"</p>

<p>He answered: "Underneath the dark."</p>

<p>Their eyes had met, and June cried scornfully: "A London
sunset!"</p>

<p>Egyptian cigarettes were handed in a silver box. Soames, taking
one, remarked: "What time's your play begin?"</p>

<p>No one replied, and Turkish coffee followed in enamelled
cups.</p>

<p>Irene, smiling quietly, said: "If only..."</p>

<p>"Only what?" said June.</p>

<p>"If only it could always be the spring!"</p>

<p>Brandy was handed; it was pale and old.</p>

<p>Soames said: "Bosinney, better take some brandy."</p>

<p>Bosinney took a glass; they all arose.</p>

<p>"You want a cab?" asked Soames.</p>

<p>June answered: "No! My cloaks please, Bilson." Her cloak was
brought.</p>

<p>Irene, from the window, murmured: "Such a lovely night! The
stars are coming out!"</p>

<p>Soames added: "Well, I hope you'll both enjoy yourselves."</p>

<p>From the door June answered: "Thanks. Come, Phil."</p>

<p>Bosinney cried: "I'm coming."</p>

<p>Soames smiled a sneering smile, and said: "I wish you luck!"</p>

<p>And at the door Irene watched them go.</p>

<p>Bosinney called: "Good night!"</p>

<p>"Good night!" she answered softly...</p>

<p>June made her lover take her on the top of a 'bus, saying she
wanted air, and there sat silent, with her face to the breeze.</p>

<p>The driver turned once or twice, with the intention of venturing
a remark, but thought better of it. They were a lively couple! The
spring had got into his blood, too; he felt the need for letting
steam escape, and clucked his tongue, flourishing his whip,
wheeling his horses, and even they, poor things, had smelled the
spring, and for a brief half-hour spurned the pavement with happy
hoofs.</p>

<p>The whole town was alive; the boughs, curled upward with their
decking of young leaves, awaited some gift the breeze could bring.
New-lighted lamps were gaining mastery, and the faces of the crowd
showed pale under that glare, while on high the great white clouds
slid swiftly, softly, over the purple sky.</p>

<p>Men in, evening dress had thrown back overcoats, stepping
jauntily up the steps of Clubs; working folk loitered; and
women&mdash;those women who at that time of night are
solitary&mdash;solitary and moving eastward in a stream&mdash;swung
slowly along, with expectation in their gait, dreaming of good wine
and a good supper, or&mdash;for an unwonted minute, of kisses given
for love.</p>

<p>Those countless figures, going their ways under the lamps and
the moving-sky, had one and all received some restless blessing
from the stir of spring. And one and all, like those clubmen with
their opened coats, had shed something of caste, and creed, and
custom, and by the cock of their hats, the pace of their walk,
their laughter, or their silence, revealed their common kinship
under the passionate heavens.</p>

<p>Bosinney and June entered the theatre in silence, and mounted to
their seats in the upper boxes. The piece had just begun, and the
half-darkened house, with its rows of creatures peering all one
way, resembled a great garden of flowers turning their faces to the
sun.</p>

<p>June had never before been in the upper boxes. From the age of
fifteen she had habitually accompanied her grandfather to the
stalls, and not common stalls, but the best seats in the house,
towards the centre of the third row, booked by old Jolyon, at
Grogan and Boyne's, on his way home from the City, long before the
day; carried in his overcoat pocket, together with his cigar-case
and his old kid gloves, and handed to June to keep till the
appointed night. And in those stalls&mdash;an erect old figure with
a serene white head, a little figure, strenuous and eager, with a
red-gold head&mdash;they would sit through every kind of play, and
on the way home old Jolyon would say of the principal actor: "Oh,
he's a poor stick! You should have seen little Bobson!"</p>

<p>She had looked forward to this evening with keen delight; it was
stolen, chaperone-less, undreamed of at Stanhope Gate, where she
was supposed to be at Soames'. She had expected reward for her
subterfuge, planned for her lover's sake; she had expected it to
break up the thick, chilly cloud, and make the relations between
them which of late had been so puzzling, so tormenting&mdash;sunny
and simple again as they had been before the winter. She had come
with the intention of saying something definite; and she looked at
the stage with a furrow between her brows, seeing nothing, her
hands squeezed together in her lap. A swarm of jealous suspicions
stung and stung her.</p>

<p>If Bosinney was conscious of her trouble he made no sign.</p>

<p>The curtain dropped. The first act had come to an end.</p>

<p>"It's awfully hot here!" said the girl; "I should like to go
out."</p>

<p>She was very white, and she knew&mdash;for with her nerves thus
sharpened she saw everything&mdash;that he was both uneasy and
compunctious.</p>

<p>At the back of the theatre an open balcony hung over the street;
she took possession of this, and stood leaning there without a
word, waiting for him to begin.</p>

<p>At last she could bear it no longer.</p>

<p>"I want to say something to you, Phil," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>The defensive tone of his voice brought the colour flying to her
cheek, the words flying to her lips: "You don't give me a chance to
be nice to you; you haven't for ages now!"</p>

<p>Bosinney stared down at the street. He made no answer...</p>

<p>June cried passionately: "You know I want to do everything for
you&mdash;that I want to be everything to you..."</p>

<p>A hum rose from the street, and, piercing it with a sharp
'ping,' the bell sounded for the raising of the curtain. June did
not stir. A desperate struggle was going on within her. Should she
put everything to the proof? Should she challenge directly that
influence, that attraction which was driving him away from her? It
was her nature to challenge, and she said: "Phil, take me to see
the house on Sunday!"</p>

<p>With a smile quivering and breaking on her lips, and trying, how
hard, not to show that she was watching, she searched his face, saw
it waver and hesitate, saw a troubled line come between his brows,
the blood rush into his face. He answered: "Not Sunday, dear; some
other day!"</p>

<p>"Why not Sunday? I shouldn't be in the way on Sunday."</p>

<p>He made an evident effort, and said: "I have an engagement."</p>

<p>"You are going to take..."</p>

<p>His eyes grew angry; he shrugged his shoulders, and answered:
"An engagement that will prevent my taking you to see the
house!"</p>

<p>June bit her lip till the blood came, and walked back to her
seat without another word, but she could not help the tears of rage
rolling down her face. The house had been mercifully darkened for a
crisis, and no one could see her trouble.</p>

<p>Yet in this world of Forsytes let no man think himself immune
from observation.</p>

<p>In the third row behind, Euphemia, Nicholas's youngest daughter,
with her married-sister, Mrs. Tweetyman, were watching.</p>

<p>They reported at Timothy's, how they had seen June and her
fiance at the theatre.</p>

<p>"In the stalls?"</p>

<p>"No, not in the..."</p>

<p>"Oh! in the dress circle, of course. That seemed to be quite
fashionable nowadays with young people!"</p>

<p>Well&mdash;not exactly. In the...Anyway, that engagement
wouldn't last long. They had never seen anyone look so thunder and
lightningy as that little June! With tears of enjoyment in their
eyes, they related how she had kicked a man's hat as she returned
to her seat in the middle of an act, and how the man had looked.
Euphemia had a noted, silent laugh, terminating most
disappointingly in squeaks; and when Mrs. Small, holding up her
hands, said: "My dear! Kicked a ha-at?" she let out such a number
of these that she had to be recovered with smelling-salts. As she
went away she said to Mrs. Tweetyman:</p>

<p>"Kicked a&mdash;ha-at! Oh! I shall die."</p>

<p>For 'that little June' this evening, that was to have been 'her
treat,' was the most miserable she had ever spent. God knows she
tried to stifle her pride, her suspicion, her jealousy!</p>

<p>She parted from Bosinney at old Jolyon's door without breaking
down; the feeling that her lover must be conquered was strong
enough to sustain her till his retiring footsteps brought home the
true extent of her wretchedness.</p>

<p>The noiseless 'Sankey' let her in. She would have slipped up to
her own room, but old Jolyon, who had heard her entrance, was in
the dining-room doorway.</p>

<p>"Come in and have your milk," he said. "It's been kept hot for
you. You're very late. Where have you been?"</p>

<p>June stood at the fireplace, with a foot on the fender and an
arm on the mantelpiece, as her grandfather had done when he came in
that night of the opera. She was too near a breakdown to care what
she told him.</p>

<p>"We dined at Soames's."</p>

<p>"H'm! the man of property! His wife there and Bosinney?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon's glance was fixed on her with the penetrating gaze
from which it was difficult to hide; but she was not looking at
him, and when she turned her face, he dropped his scrutiny at once.
He had seen enough, and too much. He bent down to lift the cup of
milk for her from the hearth, and, turning away, grumbled: "You
oughtn't to stay out so late; it makes you fit for nothing."</p>

<p>He was invisible now behind his paper, which he turned with a
vicious crackle; but when June came up to kiss him, he said:
"Good-night, my darling," in a tone so tremulous and unexpected,
that it was all the girl could do to get out of the room without
breaking into the fit of sobbing which lasted her well on into the
night.</p>

<p>When the door was closed, old Jolyon dropped his paper, and
stared long and anxiously in front of him.</p>

<p>'The beggar!' he thought. 'I always knew she'd have trouble with
him!'</p>

<p>Uneasy doubts and suspicions, the more poignant that he felt
himself powerless to check or control the march of events, came
crowding upon him.</p>

<p>Was the fellow going to jilt her? He longed to go and say to
him: "Look here, you sir! Are you going to jilt my grand-daughter?"
But how could he? Knowing little or nothing, he was yet certain,
with his unerring astuteness, that there was something going on. He
suspected Bosinney of being too much at Montpellier Square.</p>

<p>'This fellow,' he thought, 'may not be a scamp; his face is not
a bad one, but he's a queer fish. I don't know what to make of him.
I shall never know what to make of him! They tell me he works like
a nigger, but I see no good coming of it. He's unpractical, he has
no method. When he comes here, he sits as glum as a monkey. If I
ask him what wine he'll have, he says: "Thanks, any wine." If I
offer him a cigar, he smokes it as if it were a twopenny German
thing. I never see him looking at June as he ought to look at her;
and yet, he's not after her money. If she were to make a sign, he'd
be off his bargain to-morrow. But she won't&mdash;not she! She'll
stick to him! She's as obstinate as fate&mdash;She'll never let
go!'</p>

<p>Sighing deeply, he turned the paper; in its columns, perchance
he might find consolation.</p>

<p>And upstairs in her room June sat at her open window, where the
spring wind came, after its revel across the Park, to cool her hot
cheeks and burn her heart.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER III&mdash;DRIVE WITH SWITHIN</h3>

<p>Two lines of a certain song in a certain famous old school's
songbook run as follows:</p>

<p>'How the buttons on his blue frock shone, tra-la-la! How he
carolled and he sang, like a bird!...'</p>

<p>Swithin did not exactly carol and sing like a bird, but he felt
almost like endeavouring to hum a tune, as he stepped out of Hyde
Park Mansions, and contemplated his horses drawn up before the
door.</p>

<p>The afternoon was as balmy as a day in June, and to complete the
simile of the old song, he had put on a blue frock-coat, dispensing
with an overcoat, after sending Adolf down three times to make sure
that there was not the least suspicion of east in the wind; and the
frock-coat was buttoned so tightly around his personable form,
that, if the buttons did not shine, they might pardonably have done
so. Majestic on the pavement he fitted on a pair of dog-skin
gloves; with his large bell-shaped top hat, and his great stature
and bulk he looked too primeval for a Forsyte. His thick white
hair, on which Adolf had bestowed a touch of pomatum, exhaled the
fragrance of opoponax and cigars&mdash;the celebrated Swithin
brand, for which he paid one hundred and forty shillings the
hundred, and of which old Jolyon had unkindly said, he wouldn't
smoke them as a gift; they wanted the stomach of a horse!</p>

<p>"Adolf!"</p>

<p>"Sare!"</p>

<p>"The new plaid rug!"</p>

<p>He would never teach that fellow to look smart; and Mrs. Soames
he felt sure, had an eye!</p>

<p>"The phaeton hood down; I am
going&mdash;to&mdash;drive&mdash;a&mdash;lady!"</p>

<p>A pretty woman would want to show off her frock; and
well&mdash;he was going to drive a lady! It was like a new
beginning to the good old days.</p>

<p>Ages since he had driven a woman! The last time, if he
remembered, it had been Juley; the poor old soul had been as
nervous as a cat the whole time, and so put him out of patience
that, as he dropped her in the Bayswater Road, he had said: "Well
I'm d&mdash;&mdash;d if I ever drive you again!" And he never had,
not he!</p>

<p>Going up to his horses' heads, he examined their bits; not that
he knew anything about bits&mdash;he didn't pay his coachman sixty
pounds a year to do his work for him, that had never been his
principle. Indeed, his reputation as a horsey man rested mainly on
the fact that once, on Derby Day, he had been welshed by some
thimble-riggers. But someone at the Club, after seeing him drive
his greys up to the door&mdash;he always drove grey horses, you got
more style for the money, some thought&mdash;had called him
'Four-in-hand Forsyte.' The name having reached his ears through
that fellow Nicholas Treffry, old Jolyon's dead partner, the great
driving man notorious for more carriage accidents than any man in
the kingdom&mdash;Swithin had ever after conceived it right to act
up to it. The name had taken his fancy, not because he had ever
driven four-in-hand, or was ever likely to, but because of
something distinguished in the sound. Four-in-hand Forsyte! Not
bad! Born too soon, Swithin had missed his vocation. Coming upon
London twenty years later, he could not have failed to have become
a stockbroker, but at the time when he was obliged to select, this
great profession had not as yet became the chief glory of the
upper-middle class. He had literally been forced into land
agency.</p>

<p>Once in the driving seat, with the reins handed to him, and
blinking over his pale old cheeks in the full sunlight, he took a
slow look round&mdash;Adolf was already up behind; the cockaded
groom at the horses' heads stood ready to let go; everything was
prepared for the signal, and Swithin gave it. The equipage dashed
forward, and before you could say Jack Robinson, with a rattle and
flourish drew up at Soames' door.</p>

<p>Irene came out at once, and stepped in&mdash;he afterward
described it at Timothy's&mdash;"as light
as&mdash;er&mdash;Taglioni, no fuss about it, no wanting this or
wanting that;" and above all, Swithin dwelt on this, staring at
Mrs. Septimus in a way that disconcerted her a good deal, "no silly
nervousness!" To Aunt Hester he portrayed Irene's hat. "Not one of
your great flopping things, sprawling about, and catching the dust,
that women are so fond of nowadays, but a neat little&mdash;" he
made a circular motion of his hand, "white veil&mdash;capital
taste."</p>

<p>"What was it made of?" inquired Aunt Hester, who manifested a
languid but permanent excitement at any mention of dress.</p>

<p>"Made of?" returned Swithin; "now how should I know?"</p>

<p>He sank into silence so profound that Aunt Hester began to be
afraid he had fallen into a trance. She did not try to rouse him
herself, it not being her custom.</p>

<p>'I wish somebody would come,' she thought; 'I don't like the
look of him!'</p>

<p>But suddenly Swithin returned to life.</p>

<p>"Made of," he wheezed out slowly, "what should it be made
of?"</p>

<p>They had not gone four miles before Swithin received the
impression that Irene liked driving with him. Her face was so soft
behind that white veil, and her dark eyes shone so in the spring
light, and whenever he spoke she raised them to him and smiled.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning Soames had found her at her writing-table
with a note written to Swithin, putting him off. Why did she want
to put him off? he asked. She might put her own people off when she
liked, he would not have her putting off his people!</p>

<p>She had looked at him intently, had torn up the note, and said:
"Very well!"</p>

<p>And then she began writing another. He took a casual glance
presently, and saw that it was addressed to Bosinney.</p>

<p>"What are you writing to him about?" he asked.</p>

<p>Irene, looking at him again with that intent look, said quietly:
"Something he wanted me to do for him!"</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Soames,&mdash;"Commissions!"</p>

<p>"You'll have your work cut out if you begin that sort of thing!"
He said no more.</p>

<p>Swithin opened his eyes at the mention of Robin Hill; it was a
long way for his horses, and he always dined at half-past seven,
before the rush at the Club began; the new chef took more trouble
with an early dinner&mdash;a lazy rascal!</p>

<p>He would like to have a look at the house, however. A house
appealed to any Forsyte, and especially to one who had been an
auctioneer. After all he said the distance was nothing. When he was
a younger man he had had rooms at Richmond for many years, kept his
carriage and pair there, and drove them up and down to business
every day of his life.</p>

<p>Four-in-hand Forsyte they called him! His T-cart, his horses had
been known from Hyde Park Corner to the Star and Garter. The Duke
of Z&mdash;&mdash; wanted to get hold of them, would have given him
double the money, but he had kept them; know a good thing when you
have it, eh? A look of solemn pride came portentously on his shaven
square old face, he rolled his head in his stand-up collar, like a
turkey-cock preening himself.</p>

<p>She was really&mdash;a charming woman! He enlarged upon her
frock afterwards to Aunt Juley, who held up her hands at his way of
putting it.</p>

<p>Fitted her like a skin&mdash;tight as a drum; that was how he
liked 'em, all of a piece, none of your daverdy, scarecrow women!
He gazed at Mrs. Septimus Small, who took after James&mdash;long
and thin.</p>

<p>"There's style about her," he went on, "fit for a king! And
she's so quiet with it too!"</p>

<p>"She seems to have made quite a conquest of you, any way,"
drawled Aunt Hester from her corner.</p>

<p>Swithin heard extremely well when anybody attacked him.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he said. "I know a&mdash;pretty&mdash;woman when
I see one, and all I can say is, I don't see the young man about
that's fit for her; but perhaps&mdash;you&mdash;do, come,
perhaps&mdash;you-do!"</p>

<p>"Oh?" murmured Aunt Hester, "ask Juley!"</p>

<p>Long before they reached Robin Hill, however, the unaccustomed
airing had made him terribly sleepy; he drove with his eyes closed,
a life-time of deportment alone keeping his tall and bulky form
from falling askew.</p>

<p>Bosinney, who was watching, came out to meet them, and all three
entered the house together; Swithin in front making play with a
stout gold-mounted Malacca cane, put into his hand by Adolf, for
his knees were feeling the effects of their long stay in the same
position. He had assumed his fur coat, to guard against the
draughts of the unfinished house.</p>

<p>The staircase&mdash;he said&mdash;was handsome! the baronial
style! They would want some statuary about! He came to a standstill
between the columns of the doorway into the inner court, and held
out his cane inquiringly.</p>

<p>What was this to be&mdash;this vestibule, or whatever they
called it? But gazing at the skylight, inspiration came to him.</p>

<p>"Ah! the billiard-room!"</p>

<p>When told it was to be a tiled court with plants in the centre,
he turned to Irene:</p>

<p>"Waste this on plants? You take my advice and have a billiard
table here!"</p>

<p>Irene smiled. She had lifted her veil, banding it like a nun's
coif across her forehead, and the smile of her dark eyes below this
seemed to Swithin more charming than ever. He nodded. She would
take his advice he saw.</p>

<p>He had little to say of the drawing or dining-rooms, which he
described as "spacious"; but fell into such raptures as he
permitted to a man of his dignity, in the wine-cellar, to which he
descended by stone steps, Bosinney going first with a light.</p>

<p>"You'll have room here," he said, "for six or seven hundred
dozen&mdash;a very pooty little cellar!"</p>

<p>Bosinney having expressed the wish to show them the house from
the copse below, Swithin came to a stop.</p>

<p>"There's a fine view from here," he remarked; "you haven't such
a thing as a chair?"</p>

<p>A chair was brought him from Bosinney's tent.</p>

<p>"You go down," he said blandly; "you two! I'll sit here and look
at the view."</p>

<p>He sat down by the oak tree, in the sun; square and upright,
with one hand stretched out, resting on the nob of his cane, the
other planted on his knee; his fur coat thrown open, his hat,
roofing with its flat top the pale square of his face; his stare,
very blank, fixed on the landscape.</p>

<p>He nodded to them as they went off down through the fields. He
was, indeed, not sorry to be left thus for a quiet moment of
reflection. The air was balmy, not too much heat in the sun; the
prospect a fine one, a remarka...His head fell a little to one
side; he jerked it up and thought: Odd! He&mdash;ah! They were
waving to him from the bottom! He put up his hand, and moved it
more than once. They were active&mdash;the prospect was remar...His
head fell to the left, he jerked it up at once; it fell to the
right. It remained there; he was asleep.</p>

<p>And asleep, a sentinel on the&mdash;top of the rise, he appeared
to rule over this prospect&mdash;remarkable&mdash;like some image
blocked out by the special artist, of primeval Forsytes in pagan
days, to record the domination of mind over matter!</p>

<p>And all the unnumbered generations of his yeoman ancestors, wont
of a Sunday to stand akimbo surveying their little plots of land,
their grey unmoving eyes hiding their instinct with its hidden
roots of violence, their instinct for possession to the exclusion
of all the world&mdash;all these unnumbered generations seemed to
sit there with him on the top of the rise.</p>

<p>But from him, thus slumbering, his jealous Forsyte spirit
travelled far, into God-knows-what jungle of fancies; with those
two young people, to see what they were doing down there in the
copse&mdash;in the copse where the spring was running riot with the
scent of sap and bursting buds, the song of birds innumerable, a
carpet of bluebells and sweet growing things, and the sun caught
like gold in the tops of the trees; to see what they were doing,
walking along there so close together on the path that was too
narrow; walking along there so close that they were always
touching; to watch Irene's eyes, like dark thieves, stealing the
heart out of the spring. And a great unseen chaperon, his spirit
was there, stopping with them to look at the little furry corpse of
a mole, not dead an hour, with his mushroom-and-silver coat
untouched by the rain or dew; watching over Irene's bent head, and
the soft look of her pitying eyes; and over that young man's head,
gazing at her so hard, so strangely. Walking on with them, too,
across the open space where a wood-cutter had been at work, where
the bluebells were trampled down, and a trunk had swayed and
staggered down from its gashed stump. Climbing it with them, over,
and on to the very edge of the copse, whence there stretched an
undiscovered country, from far away in which came the sounds,
'Cuckoo-cuckoo!'</p>

<p>Silent, standing with them there, and uneasy at their silence!
Very queer, very strange!</p>

<p>Then back again, as though guilty, through the wood&mdash;back
to the cutting, still silent, amongst the songs of birds that never
ceased, and the wild scent&mdash;hum! what was it&mdash;like that
herb they put in&mdash;back to the log across the path...</p>

<p>And then unseen, uneasy, flapping above them, trying to make
noises, his Forsyte spirit watched her balanced on the log, her
pretty figure swaying, smiling down at that young man gazing up
with such strange, shining eyes, slipping now&mdash;a&mdash;ah!
falling, o&mdash;oh! sliding&mdash;down his breast; her soft, warm
body clutched, her head bent back from his lips; his kiss; her
recoil; his cry: "You must know&mdash;I love you!" Must
know&mdash;indeed, a pretty...? Love! Hah!</p>

<p>Swithin awoke; virtue had gone out of him. He had a taste in his
mouth. Where was he?</p>

<p>Damme! He had been asleep!</p>

<p>He had dreamed something about a new soup, with a taste of mint
in it.</p>

<p>Those young people&mdash;where had they got to? His left leg had
pins and needles.</p>

<p>"Adolf!" The rascal was not there; the rascal was asleep
somewhere.</p>

<p>He stood up, tall, square, bulky in his fur, looking anxiously
down over the fields, and presently he saw them coming.</p>

<p>Irene was in front; that young fellow&mdash;what had they
nicknamed him&mdash;'The Buccaneer?' looked precious hangdog there
behind her; had got a flea in his ear, he shouldn't wonder. Serve
him right, taking her down all that way to look at the house! The
proper place to look at a house from was the lawn.</p>

<p>They saw him. He extended his arm, and moved it spasmodically to
encourage them. But they had stopped. What were they standing there
for, talking&mdash;talking? They came on again. She had been,
giving him a rub, he had not the least doubt of it, and no wonder,
over a house like that&mdash;a great ugly thing, not the sort of
house he was accustomed to.</p>

<p>He looked intently at their faces, with his pale, immovable
stare. That young man looked very queer!</p>

<p>"You'll never make anything of this!" he said tartly, pointing
at the mansion;&mdash;"too newfangled!"</p>

<p>Bosinney gazed at him as though he had not heard; and Swithin
afterwards described him to Aunt Hester as "an extravagant sort of
fellow very odd way of looking at you&mdash;a bumpy beggar!"</p>

<p>What gave rise to this sudden piece of psychology he did not
state; possibly Bosinney's, prominent forehead and cheekbones and
chin, or something hungry in his face, which quarrelled with
Swithin's conception of the calm satiety that should characterize
the perfect gentleman.</p>

<p>He brightened up at the mention of tea. He had a contempt for
tea&mdash;his brother Jolyon had been in tea; made a lot of money
by it&mdash;but he was so thirsty, and had such a taste in his
mouth, that he was prepared to drink anything. He longed to inform
Irene of the taste in his mouth&mdash;she was so
sympathetic&mdash;but it would not be a distinguished thing to do;
he rolled his tongue round, and faintly smacked it against his
palate.</p>

<p>In a far corner of the tent Adolf was bending his cat-like
moustaches over a kettle. He left it at once to draw the cork of a
pint-bottle of champagne. Swithin smiled, and, nodding at Bosinney,
said: "Why, you're quite a Monte Cristo!" This celebrated
novel&mdash;one of the half-dozen he had read&mdash;had produced an
extraordinary impression on his mind.</p>

<p>Taking his glass from the table, he held it away from him to
scrutinize the colour; thirsty as he was, it was not likely that he
was going to drink trash! Then, placing it to his lips, he took a
sip.</p>

<p>"A very nice wine," he said at last, passing it before his nose;
"not the equal of my Heidsieck!"</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the idea came to him which he
afterwards imparted at Timothy's in this nutshell: "I shouldn't
wonder a bit if that architect chap were sweet upon Mrs.
Soames!"</p>

<p>And from this moment his pale, round eyes never ceased to bulge
with the interest of his discovery.</p>

<p>"The fellow," he said to Mrs. Septimus, "follows her about with
his eyes like a dog&mdash;the bumpy beggar! I don't wonder at
it&mdash;she's a very charming woman, and, I should say, the pink
of discretion!" A vague consciousness of perfume caging about
Irene, like that from a flower with half-closed petals and a
passionate heart, moved him to the creation of this image. "But I
wasn't sure of it," he said, "till I saw him pick up her
handkerchief."</p>

<p>Mrs. Small's eyes boiled with excitement.</p>

<p>"And did he give it her back?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Give it back?" said Swithin: "I saw him slobber on it when he
thought I wasn't looking!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Small gasped&mdash;too interested to speak.</p>

<p>"But she gave him no encouragement," went on Swithin; he
stopped, and stared for a minute or two in the way that alarmed
Aunt Hester so&mdash;he had suddenly recollected that, as they were
starting back in the phaeton, she had given Bosinney her hand a
second time, and let it stay there too...He had touched his horses
smartly with the whip, anxious to get her all to himself. But she
had looked back, and she had not answered his first question;
neither had he been able to see her face&mdash;she had kept it
hanging down.</p>

<p>There is somewhere a picture, which Swithin has not seen, of a
man sitting on a rock, and by him, immersed in the still, green
water, a sea-nymph lying on her back, with her hand on her naked
breast. She has a half-smile on her face&mdash;a smile of hopeless
surrender and of secret joy.</p>

<p>Seated by Swithin's side, Irene may have been smiling like
that.</p>

<p>When, warmed by champagne, he had her all to himself, he
unbosomed himself of his wrongs; of his smothered resentment
against the new chef at the club; his worry over the house in
Wigmore Street, where the rascally tenant had gone bankrupt through
helping his brother-in-law as if charity did not begin at home; of
his deafness, too, and that pain he sometimes got in his right
side. She listened, her eyes swimming under their lids. He thought
she was thinking deeply of his troubles, and pitied himself
terribly. Yet in his fur coat, with frogs across the breast, his
top hat aslant, driving this beautiful woman, he had never felt
more distinguished.</p>

<p>A coster, however, taking his girl for a Sunday airing, seemed
to have the same impression about himself. This person had flogged
his donkey into a gallop alongside, and sat, upright as a waxwork,
in his shallopy chariot, his chin settled pompously on a red
handkerchief, like Swithin's on his full cravat; while his girl,
with the ends of a fly-blown boa floating out behind, aped a woman
of fashion. Her swain moved a stick with a ragged bit of string
dangling from the end, reproducing with strange fidelity the
circular flourish of Swithin's whip, and rolled his head at his
lady with a leer that had a weird likeness to Swithin's primeval
stare.</p>

<p>Though for a time unconscious of the lowly ruffian's presence,
Swithin presently took it into his head that he was being guyed. He
laid his whip-lash across the mares flank. The two chariots,
however, by some unfortunate fatality continued abreast. Swithin's
yellow, puffy face grew red; he raised his whip to lash the
costermonger, but was saved from so far forgetting his dignity by a
special intervention of Providence. A carriage driving out through
a gate forced phaeton and donkey-cart into proximity; the wheels
grated, the lighter vehicle skidded, and was overturned.</p>

<p>Swithin did not look round. On no account would he have pulled
up to help the ruffian. Serve him right if he had broken his
neck!</p>

<p>But he could not if he would. The greys had taken alarm. The
phaeton swung from side to side, and people raised frightened faces
as they went dashing past. Swithin's great arms, stretched at full
length, tugged at the reins. His cheeks were puffed, his lips
compressed, his swollen face was of a dull, angry red.</p>

<p>Irene had her hand on the rail, and at every lurch she gripped
it tightly. Swithin heard her ask:</p>

<p>"Are we going to have an accident, Uncle Swithin?"</p>

<p>He gasped out between his pants: "It's nothing; a&mdash;little
fresh!"</p>

<p>"I've never been in an accident."</p>

<p>"Don't you move!" He took a look at her. She was smiling,
perfectly calm. "Sit still," he repeated. "Never fear, I'll get you
home!"</p>

<p>And in the midst of all his terrible efforts, he was surprised
to hear her answer in a voice not like her own:</p>

<p>"I don't care if I never get home!"</p>

<p>The carriage giving a terrific lurch, Swithin's exclamation was
jerked back into his throat. The horses, winded by the rise of a
hill, now steadied to a trot, and finally stopped of their own
accord.</p>

<p>"When"&mdash;Swithin described it at Timothy's&mdash;"I pulled
'em up, there she was as cool as myself. God bless my soul! she
behaved as if she didn't care whether she broke her neck or not!
What was it she said: 'I don't care if I never get home?" Leaning
over the handle of his cane, he wheezed out, to Mrs. Small's
terror: "And I'm not altogether surprised, with a finickin' feller
like young Soames for a husband!"</p>

<p>It did not occur to him to wonder what Bosinney had done after
they had left him there alone; whether he had gone wandering about
like the dog to which Swithin had compared him; wandering down to
that copse where the spring was still in riot, the cuckoo still
calling from afar; gone down there with her handkerchief pressed to
lips, its fragrance mingling with the scent of mint and thyme. Gone
down there with such a wild, exquisite pain in his heart that he
could have cried out among the trees. Or what, indeed, the fellow
had done. In fact, till he came to Timothy's, Swithin had forgotten
all about him.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER IV&mdash;JAMES GOES TO SEE FOR HIMSELF</h3>

<p>Those ignorant of Forsyte 'Change would not, perhaps, foresee
all the stir made by Irene's visit to the house.</p>

<p>After Swithin had related at Timothy's the full story of his
memorable drive, the same, with the least suspicion of curiosity,
the merest touch of malice, and a real desire to do good, was
passed on to June.</p>

<p>"And what a dreadful thing to say, my dear!" ended Aunt Juley;
"that about not going home. What did she mean?"</p>

<p>It was a strange recital for the girl. She heard it flushing
painfully, and, suddenly, with a curt handshake, took her
departure.</p>

<p>"Almost rude!" Mrs. Small said to Aunt Hester, when June was
gone.</p>

<p>The proper construction was put on her reception of the news.
She was upset. Something was therefore very wrong. Odd! She and
Irene had been such friends!</p>

<p>It all tallied too well with whispers and hints that had been
going about for some time past. Recollections of Euphemia's account
of the visit to the theatre&mdash;Mr. Bosinney always at Soames's?
Oh, indeed! Yes, of course, he would be about the house! Nothing
open. Only upon the greatest, the most important provocation was it
necessary to say anything open on Forsyte 'Change. This machine was
too nicely adjusted; a hint, the merest trifling expression of
regret or doubt, sufficed to set the family soul so
sympathetic&mdash;vibrating. No one desired that harm should come
of these vibrations&mdash;far from it; they were set in motion with
the best intentions, with the feeling, that each member of the
family had a stake in the family soul.</p>

<p>And much kindness lay at the bottom of the gossip; it would
frequently result in visits of condolence being made, in accordance
with the customs of Society, thereby conferring a real benefit upon
the sufferers, and affording consolation to the sound, who felt
pleasantly that someone at all events was suffering from that from
which they themselves were not suffering. In fact, it was simply a
desire to keep things well-aired, the desire which animates the
Public Press, that brought James, for instance, into communication
with Mrs. Septimus, Mrs. Septimus, with the little Nicholases, the
little Nicholases with who-knows-whom, and so on. That great class
to which they had risen, and now belonged, demanded a certain
candour, a still more certain reticence. This combination
guaranteed their membership.</p>

<p>Many of the younger Forsytes felt, very naturally, and would
openly declare, that they did not want their affairs pried into;
but so powerful was the invisible, magnetic current of family
gossip, that for the life of them they could not help knowing all
about everything. It was felt to be hopeless.</p>

<p>One of them (young Roger) had made an heroic attempt to free the
rising generation, by speaking of Timothy as an 'old cat.' The
effort had justly recoiled upon himself; the words, coming round in
the most delicate way to Aunt Juley's ears, were repeated by her in
a shocked voice to Mrs. Roger, whence they returned again to young
Roger.</p>

<p>And, after all, it was only the wrong-doers who suffered; as,
for instance, George, when he lost all that money playing
billiards; or young Roger himself, when he was so dreadfully near
to marrying the girl to whom, it was whispered, he was already
married by the laws of Nature; or again Irene, who was thought,
rather than said, to be in danger.</p>

<p>All this was not only pleasant but salutary. And it made so many
hours go lightly at Timothy's in the Bayswater Road; so many hours
that must otherwise have been sterile and heavy to those three who
lived there; and Timothy's was but one of hundreds of such homes in
this City of London&mdash;the homes of neutral persons of the
secure classes, who are out of the battle themselves, and must find
their reason for existing, in the battles of others.</p>

<p>But for the sweetness of family gossip, it must indeed have been
lonely there. Rumours and tales, reports, surmises&mdash;were they
not the children of the house, as dear and precious as the
prattling babes the brother and sisters had missed in their own
journey? To talk about them was as near as they could get to the
possession of all those children and grandchildren, after whom
their soft hearts yearned. For though it is doubtful whether
Timothy's heart yearned, it is indubitable that at the arrival of
each fresh Forsyte child he was quite upset.</p>

<p>Useless for young Roger to say, "Old cat!" for Euphemia to hold
up her hands and cry: "Oh! those three!" and break into her silent
laugh with the squeak at the end. Useless, and not too kind.</p>

<p>The situation which at this stage might seem, and especially to
Forsyte eyes, strange&mdash;not to say 'impossible'&mdash;was, in
view of certain facts, not so strange after all. Some things had
been lost sight of. And first, in the security bred of many
harmless marriages, it had been forgotten that Love is no hot-house
flower, but a wild plant, born of a wet night, born of an hour of
sunshine; sprung from wild seed, blown along the road by a wild
wind. A wild plant that, when it blooms by chance within the hedge
of our gardens, we call a flower; and when it blooms outside we
call a weed; but, flower or weed, whose scent and colour are
always, wild! And further&mdash;the facts and figures of their own
lives being against the perception of this truth&mdash;it was not
generally recognised by Forsytes that, where, this wild plant
springs, men and women are but moths around the pale, flame-like
blossom.</p>

<p>It was long since young Jolyon's escapade&mdash;there was danger
of a tradition again arising that people in their position never
cross the hedge to pluck that flower; that one could reckon on
having love, like measles, once in due season, and getting over it
comfortably for all time&mdash;as with measles, on a soothing
mixture of butter and honey&mdash;in the arms of wedlock.</p>

<p>Of all those whom this strange rumour about Bosinney and Mrs.
Soames reached, James was the most affected. He had long forgotten
how he had hovered, lanky and pale, in side whiskers of chestnut
hue, round Emily, in the days of his own courtship. He had long
forgotten the small house in the purlieus of Mayfair, where he had
spent the early days of his married life, or rather, he had long
forgotten the early days, not the small house,&mdash;a Forsyte
never forgot a house&mdash;he had afterwards sold it at a clear
profit of four hundred pounds.</p>

<p>He had long forgotten those days, with their hopes and fears and
doubts about the prudence of the match (for Emily, though pretty,
had nothing, and he himself at that time was making a bare thousand
a year), and that strange, irresistible attraction which had drawn
him on, till he felt he must die if he could not marry the girl
with the fair hair, looped so neatly back, the fair arms emerging
from a skin-tight bodice, the fair form decorously shielded by a
cage of really stupendous circumference.</p>

<p>James had passed through the fire, but he had passed also
through the river of years which washes out the fire; he had
experienced the saddest experience of all&mdash;forgetfulness of
what it was like to be in love.</p>

<p>Forgotten! Forgotten so long, that he had forgotten even that he
had forgotten.</p>

<p>And now this rumour had come upon him, this rumour about his
son's wife; very vague, a shadow dodging among the palpable,
straightforward appearances of things, unreal, unintelligible as a
ghost, but carrying with it, like a ghost, inexplicable terror.</p>

<p>He tried to bring it home to his mind, but it was no more use
than trying to apply to himself one of those tragedies he read of
daily in his evening paper. He simply could not. There could be
nothing in it. It was all their nonsense. She didn't get on with
Soames as well as she might, but she was a good little
thing&mdash;a good little thing!</p>

<p>Like the not inconsiderable majority of men, James relished a
nice little bit of scandal, and would say, in a matter-of-fact
tone, licking his lips, "Yes, yes&mdash;she and young Dyson; they
tell me they're living at Monte Carlo!"</p>

<p>But the significance of an affair of this sort&mdash;of its
past, its present, or its future&mdash;had never struck him. What
it meant, what torture and raptures had gone to its construction,
what slow, overmastering fate had lurked within the facts, very
naked, sometimes sordid, but generally spicy, presented to his
gaze. He was not in the habit of blaming, praising, drawing
deductions, or generalizing at all about such things; he simply
listened rather greedily, and repeated what he was told, finding
considerable benefit from the practice, as from the consumption of
a sherry and bitters before a meal.</p>

<p>Now, however, that such a thing&mdash;or rather the rumour, the
breath of it&mdash;had come near him personally, he felt as in a
fog, which filled his mouth full of a bad, thick flavour, and made
it difficult to draw breath.</p>

<p>A scandal! A possible scandal!</p>

<p>To repeat this word to himself thus was the only way in which he
could focus or make it thinkable. He had forgotten the sensations
necessary for understanding the progress, fate, or meaning of any
such business; he simply could no longer grasp the possibilities of
people running any risk for the sake of passion.</p>

<p>Amongst all those persons of his acquaintance, who went into the
City day after day and did their business there, whatever it was,
and in their leisure moments bought shares, and houses, and ate
dinners, and played games, as he was told, it would have seemed to
him ridiculous to suppose that there were any who would run risks
for the sake of anything so recondite, so figurative, as
passion.</p>

<p>Passion! He seemed, indeed, to have heard of it, and rules such
as 'A young man and a young woman ought never to be trusted
together' were fixed in his mind as the parallels of latitude are
fixed on a map (for all Forsytes, when it comes to 'bed-rock'
matters of fact, have quite a fine taste in realism); but as to
anything else&mdash;well, he could only appreciate it at all
through the catch-word 'scandal.'</p>

<p>Ah! but there was no truth in it&mdash;could not be. He was not
afraid; she was really a good little thing. But there it was when
you got a thing like that into your mind. And James was of a
nervous temperament&mdash;one of those men whom things will not
leave alone, who suffer tortures from anticipation and indecision.
For fear of letting something slip that he might otherwise secure,
he was physically unable to make up his mind until absolutely
certain that, by not making it up, he would suffer loss.</p>

<p>In life, however, there were many occasions when the business of
making up his mind did not even rest with himself, and this was one
of them.</p>

<p>What could he do? Talk it over with Soames? That would only make
matters worse. And, after all, there was nothing in it, he felt
sure.</p>

<p>It was all that house. He had mistrusted the idea from the
first. What did Soames want to go into the country for? And, if he
must go spending a lot of money building himself a house, why not
have a first-rate man, instead of this young Bosinney, whom nobody
knew anything about? He had told them how it would be. And he had
heard that the house was costing Soames a pretty penny beyond what
he had reckoned on spending.</p>

<p>This fact, more than any other, brought home to James the real
danger of the situation. It was always like this with these
'artistic' chaps; a sensible man should have nothing to say to
them. He had warned Irene, too. And see what had come of it!</p>

<p>And it suddenly sprang into James's mind that he ought to go and
see for himself. In the midst of that fog of uneasiness in which
his mind was enveloped the notion that he could go and look at the
house afforded him inexplicable satisfaction. It may have been
simply the decision to do something&mdash;more possibly the fact
that he was going to look at a house&mdash;that gave him relief. He
felt that in staring at an edifice of bricks and mortar, of wood
and stone, built by the suspected man himself, he would be looking
into the heart of that rumour about Irene.</p>

<p>Without saying a word, therefore, to anyone, he took a hansom to
the station and proceeded by train to Robin Hill;
thence&mdash;there being no 'flies,' in accordance with the custom
of the neighbourhood&mdash;he found himself obliged to walk.</p>

<p>He started slowly up the hill, his angular knees and high
shoulders bent complainingly, his eyes fixed on his feet, yet, neat
for all that, in his high hat and his frock-coat, on which was the
speckless gloss imparted by perfect superintendence. Emily saw to
that; that is, she did not, of course, see to it&mdash;people of
good position not seeing to each other's buttons, and Emily was of
good position&mdash;but she saw that the butler saw to it.</p>

<p>He had to ask his way three times; on each occasion he repeated
the directions given him, got the man to repeat them, then repeated
them a second time, for he was naturally of a talkative
disposition, and one could not be too careful in a new
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>He kept assuring them that it was a new house he was looking
for; it was only, however, when he was shown the roof through the
trees that he could feel really satisfied that he had not been
directed entirely wrong.</p>

<p>A heavy sky seemed to cover the world with the grey whiteness of
a whitewashed ceiling. There was no freshness or fragrance in the
air. On such a day even British workmen scarcely cared to do more
then they were obliged, and moved about their business without the
drone of talk which whiles away the pangs of labour.</p>

<p>Through spaces of the unfinished house, shirt-sleeved figures
worked slowly, and sounds arose&mdash;spasmodic knockings, the
scraping of metal, the sawing of wood, with the rumble of
wheelbarrows along boards; now and again the foreman's dog,
tethered by a string to an oaken beam, whimpered feebly, with a
sound like the singing of a kettle.</p>

<p>The fresh-fitted window-panes, daubed each with a white patch in
the centre, stared out at James like the eyes of a blind dog.</p>

<p>And the building chorus went on, strident and mirthless under
the grey-white sky. But the thrushes, hunting amongst the
fresh-turned earth for worms, were silent quite.</p>

<p>James picked his way among the heaps of gravel&mdash;the drive
was being laid&mdash;till he came opposite the porch. Here he
stopped and raised his eyes. There was but little to see from this
point of view, and that little he took in at once; but he stayed in
this position many minutes, and who shall know of what he
thought.</p>

<p>His china-blue eyes under white eyebrows that jutted out in
little horns, never stirred; the long upper lip of his wide mouth,
between the fine white whiskers, twitched once or twice; it was
easy to see from that anxious rapt expression, whence Soames
derived the handicapped look which sometimes came upon his face.
James might have been saying to himself: 'I don't know&mdash;life's
a tough job.'</p>

<p>In this position Bosinney surprised him.</p>

<p>James brought his eyes down from whatever bird's-nest they had
been looking for in the sky to Bosinney's face, on which was a kind
of humorous scorn.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Forsyte? Come down to see for yourself?"</p>

<p>It was exactly what James, as we know, had come for, and he was
made correspondingly uneasy. He held out his hand, however,
saying:</p>

<p>"How are you?" without looking at Bosinney.</p>

<p>The latter made way for him with an ironical smile.</p>

<p>James scented something suspicious in this courtesy. "I should
like to walk round the outside first," he said, "and see what
you've been doing!"</p>

<p>A flagged terrace of rounded stones with a list of two or three
inches to port had been laid round the south-east and south-west
sides of the house, and ran with a bevelled edge into mould, which
was in preparation for being turfed; along this terrace James led
the way.</p>

<p>"Now what did this cost?" he asked, when he saw the terrace
extending round the corner.</p>

<p>"What should you think?" inquired Bosinney.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" replied James somewhat nonplussed; "two or
three hundred, I dare say!"</p>

<p>"The exact sum!"</p>

<p>James gave him a sharp look, but the architect appeared
unconscious, and he put the answer down to mishearing.</p>

<p>On arriving at the garden entrance, he stopped to look at the
view.</p>

<p>"That ought to come down," he said, pointing to the
oak-tree.</p>

<p>"You think so? You think that with the tree there you don't get
enough view for your money."</p>

<p>Again James eyed him suspiciously&mdash;this young man had a
peculiar way of putting things: "Well!" he said, with a perplexed,
nervous, emphasis, "I don't see what you want with a tree."</p>

<p>"It shall come down to-morrow," said Bosinney.</p>

<p>James was alarmed. "Oh," he said, "don't go saying I said it was
to come down! I know nothing about it!"</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>James went on in a fluster: "Why, what should I know about it?
It's nothing to do with me! You do it on your own
responsibility."</p>

<p>"You'll allow me to mention your name?"</p>

<p>James grew more and more alarmed: "I don't know what you want
mentioning my name for," he muttered; "you'd better leave the tree
alone. It's not your tree!"</p>

<p>He took out a silk handkerchief and wiped his brow. They entered
the house. Like Swithin, James was impressed by the inner
court-yard.</p>

<p>"You must have spent a douce of a lot of money here," he said,
after staring at the columns and gallery for some time. "Now, what
did it cost to put up those columns?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you off-hand," thoughtfully answered Bosinney,
"but I know it was a deuce of a lot!"</p>

<p>"I should think so," said James. "I should..." He caught the
architect's eye, and broke off. And now, whenever he came to
anything of which he desired to know the cost, he stifled that
curiosity.</p>

<p>Bosinney appeared determined that he should see everything, and
had not James been of too 'noticing' a nature, he would certainly
have found himself going round the house a second time. He seemed
so anxious to be asked questions, too, that James felt he must be
on his guard. He began to suffer from his exertions, for, though
wiry enough for a man of his long build, he was seventy-five years
old.</p>

<p>He grew discouraged; he seemed no nearer to anything, had not
obtained from his inspection any of the knowledge he had vaguely
hoped for. He had merely increased his dislike and mistrust of this
young man, who had tired him out with his politeness, and in whose
manner he now certainly detected mockery.</p>

<p>The fellow was sharper than he had thought, and better-looking
than he had hoped. He had a&mdash;a 'don't care' appearance that
James, to whom risk was the most intolerable thing in life, did not
appreciate; a peculiar smile, too, coming when least expected; and
very queer eyes. He reminded James, as he said afterwards, of a
hungry cat. This was as near as he could get, in conversation with
Emily, to a description of the peculiar exasperation, velvetiness,
and mockery, of which Bosinney's manner had been composed.</p>

<p>At last, having seen all that was to be seen, he came out again
at the door where he had gone in; and now, feeling that he was
wasting time and strength and money, all for nothing, he took the
courage of a Forsyte in both hands, and, looking sharply at
Bosinney, said:</p>

<p>"I dare say you see a good deal of my daughter-in-law; now, what
does she think of the house? But she hasn't seen it, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>This he said, knowing all about Irene's visit not, of course,
that there was anything in the visit, except that extraordinary
remark she had made about 'not caring to get home'&mdash;and the
story of how June had taken the news!</p>

<p>He had determined, by this way of putting the question, to give
Bosinney a chance, as he said to himself.</p>

<p>The latter was long in answering, but kept his eyes with
uncomfortable steadiness on James.</p>

<p>"She has seen the house, but I can't tell you what she thinks of
it."</p>

<p>Nervous and baffled, James was constitutionally prevented from
letting the matter drop.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said, "she has seen it? Soames brought her down, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>Bosinney smilingly replied: "Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"What, did she come down alone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;who brought her?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know whether I ought to tell you who brought
her."</p>

<p>To James, who knew that it was Swithin, this answer appeared
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>"Why!" he stammered, "you know that..." but he stopped, suddenly
perceiving his danger.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "if you don't want to tell me I suppose you
won't! Nobody tells me anything."</p>

<p>Somewhat to his surprise Bosinney asked him a question.</p>

<p>"By the by," he said, "could you tell me if there are likely to
be any more of you coming down? I should like to be on the
spot!"</p>

<p>"Any more?" said James bewildered, "who should there be more? I
don't know of any more. Good-bye?"</p>

<p>Looking at the ground he held out his hand, crossed the palm of
it with Bosinney's, and taking his umbrella just above the silk,
walked away along the terrace.</p>

<p>Before he turned the corner he glanced back, and saw Bosinney
following him slowly&mdash;'slinking along the wall' as he put it
to himself, 'like a great cat.' He paid no attention when the young
fellow raised his hat.</p>

<p>Outside the drive, and out of sight, he slackened his pace still
more. Very slowly, more bent than when he came, lean, hungry, and
disheartened, he made his way back to the station.</p>

<p>The Buccaneer, watching him go so sadly home, felt sorry perhaps
for his behaviour to the old man.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V&mdash;SOAMES AND BOSINNEY CORRESPOND</h3>

<p>James said nothing to his son of this visit to the house; but,
having occasion to go to Timothy's on morning on a matter connected
with a drainage scheme which was being forced by the sanitary
authorities on his brother, he mentioned it there.</p>

<p>It was not, he said, a bad house. He could see that a good deal
could be made of it. The fellow was clever in his way, though what
it was going to cost Soames before it was done with he didn't
know.</p>

<p>Euphemia Forsyte, who happened to be in the room&mdash;she had
come round to borrow the Rev. Mr. Scoles' last novel, 'Passion and
Paregoric', which was having such a vogue&mdash;chimed in.</p>

<p>"I saw Irene yesterday at the Stores; she and Mr. Bosinney were
having a nice little chat in the Groceries."</p>

<p>It was thus, simply, that she recorded a scene which had really
made a deep and complicated impression on her. She had been
hurrying to the silk department of the Church and Commercial
Stores&mdash;that Institution than which, with its admirable
system, admitting only guaranteed persons on a basis of payment
before delivery, no emporium can be more highly recommended to
Forsytes&mdash;to match a piece of prunella silk for her mother,
who was waiting in the carriage outside.</p>

<p>Passing through the Groceries her eye was unpleasantly attracted
by the back view of a very beautiful figure. It was so charmingly
proportioned, so balanced, and so well clothed, that Euphemia's
instinctive propriety was at once alarmed; such figures, she knew,
by intuition rather than experience, were rarely connected with
virtue&mdash;certainly never in her mind, for her own back was
somewhat difficult to fit.</p>

<p>Her suspicions were fortunately confirmed. A young man coming
from the Drugs had snatched off his hat, and was accosting the lady
with the unknown back.</p>

<p>It was then that she saw with whom she had to deal; the lady was
undoubtedly Mrs. Soames, the young man Mr. Bosinney. Concealing
herself rapidly over the purchase of a box of Tunisian dates, for
she was impatient of awkwardly meeting people with parcels in her
hands, and at the busy time of the morning, she was quite
unintentionally an interested observer of their little
interview.</p>

<p>Mrs. Soames, usually somewhat pale, had a delightful colour in
her cheeks; and Mr. Bosinney's manner was strange, though
attractive (she thought him rather a distinguished-looking man, and
George's name for him, 'The Buccaneer'&mdash;about which there was
something romantic&mdash;quite charming). He seemed to be pleading.
Indeed, they talked so earnestly&mdash;or, rather, he talked so
earnestly, for Mrs. Soames did not say much&mdash;that they caused,
inconsiderately, an eddy in the traffic. One nice old General,
going towards Cigars, was obliged to step quite out of the way, and
chancing to look up and see Mrs. Soames' face, he actually took off
his hat, the old fool! So like a man!</p>

<p>But it was Mrs. Soames' eyes that worried Euphemia. She never
once looked at Mr. Bosinney until he moved on, and then she looked
after him. And, oh, that look!</p>

<p>On that look Euphemia had spent much anxious thought. It is not
too much to say that it had hurt her with its dark, lingering
softness, for all the world as though the woman wanted to drag him
back, and unsay something she had been saying.</p>

<p>Ah, well, she had had no time to go deeply into the matter just
then, with that prunella silk on her hands; but she was 'very
intriguee'&mdash;very! She had just nodded to Mrs. Soames, to show
her that she had seen; and, as she confided, in talking it over
afterwards, to her chum Francie (Roger's daughter), "Didn't she
look caught out just?..."</p>

<p>James, most averse at the first blush to accepting any news
confirmatory of his own poignant suspicions, took her up at
once.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "they'd be after wall-papers no doubt."</p>

<p>Euphemia smiled. "In the Groceries?" she said softly; and,
taking 'Passion and Paregoric' from the table, added: "And so
you'll lend me this, dear Auntie? Good-bye!" and went away.</p>

<p>James left almost immediately after; he was late as it was.</p>

<p>When he reached the office of Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte, he
found Soames, sitting in his revolving, chair, drawing up a
defence. The latter greeted his father with a curt good-morning,
and, taking an envelope from his pocket, said:</p>

<p>"It may interest you to look through this."</p>

<p>James read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>'309D, SLOANE STREET, May 15,<br>
<br>
'DEAR FORSYTE,<br>
<br>
'The construction of your house being now completed, my duties as
architect have come to an end. If I am to go on with the business
of decoration, which at your request I undertook, I should like you
to clearly understand that I must have a free hand.<br>
<br>
'You never come down without suggesting something that goes counter
to my scheme. I have here three letters from you, each of which
recommends an article I should never dream of putting in. I had
your father here yesterday afternoon, who made further valuable
suggestions.<br>
<br>
'Please make up your mind, therefore, whether you want me to
decorate for you, or to retire which on the whole I should prefer
to do.<br>
<br>
'But understand that, if I decorate, I decorate alone, without
interference of any sort.<br>
<br>
If I do the thing, I will do it thoroughly, but I must have a free
hand.<br>
<br>
'Yours truly,<br>
<br>
'PHILIP BOSINNEY.'</blockquote>

<p>The exact and immediate cause of this letter cannot, of course,
be told, though it is not improbable that Bosinney may have been
moved by some sudden revolt against his position towards
Soames&mdash;that eternal position of Art towards
Property&mdash;which is so admirably summed up, on the back of the
most indispensable of modern appliances, in a sentence comparable
to the very finest in Tacitus:</p>

<blockquote>THOS. T. SORROW, Inventor. BERT M. PADLAND,
Proprietor.</blockquote>

<p>"What are you going to say to him?" James asked.</p>

<p>Soames did not even turn his head. "I haven't made up my mind,"
he said, and went on with his defence.</p>

<p>A client of his, having put some buildings on a piece of ground
that did not belong to him, had been suddenly and most irritatingly
warned to take them off again. After carefully going into the
facts, however, Soames had seen his way to advise that his client
had what was known as a title by possession, and that, though
undoubtedly the ground did not belong to him, he was entitled to
keep it, and had better do so; and he was now following up this
advice by taking steps to&mdash;as the sailors say&mdash;'make it
so.'</p>

<p>He had a distinct reputation for sound advice; people saying of
him: "Go to young Forsyte&mdash;a long-headed fellow!" and he
prized this reputation highly.</p>

<p>His natural taciturnity was in his favour; nothing could be more
calculated to give people, especially people with property (Soames
had no other clients), the impression that he was a safe man. And
he was safe. Tradition, habit, education, inherited aptitude,
native caution, all joined to form a solid professional honesty,
superior to temptation&mdash;from the very fact that it was built
on an innate avoidance of risk. How could he fall, when his soul
abhorred circumstances which render a fall possible&mdash;a man
cannot fall off the floor!</p>

<p>And those countless Forsytes, who, in the course of innumerable
transactions concerned with property of all sorts (from wives to
water rights), had occasion for the services of a safe man, found
it both reposeful and profitable to confide in Soames. That slight
superciliousness of his, combined with an air of mousing amongst
precedents, was in his favour too&mdash;a man would not be
supercilious unless he knew!</p>

<p>He was really at the head of the business, for though James
still came nearly every day to, see for himself, he did little now
but sit in his chair, twist his legs, slightly confuse things
already decided, and presently go away again, and the other
partner, Bustard, was a poor thing, who did a great deal of work,
but whose opinion was never taken.</p>

<p>So Soames went steadily on with his defence. Yet it would be
idle to say that his mind was at ease. He was suffering from a
sense of impending trouble, that had haunted him for some time
past. He tried to think it physical&mdash;a condition of his
liver&mdash;but knew that it was not.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. In a quarter of an hour he was due at
the General Meeting of the New Colliery Company&mdash;one of Uncle
Jolyon's concerns; he should see Uncle Jolyon there, and say
something to him about Bosinney&mdash;he had not made up his mind
what, but something&mdash;in any case he should not answer this
letter until he had seen Uncle Jolyon. He got up and methodically
put away the draft of his defence. Going into a dark little
cupboard, he turned up the light, washed his hands with a piece of
brown Windsor soap, and dried them on a roller towel. Then he
brushed his hair, paying strict attention to the parting, turned
down the light, took his hat, and saying he would be back at
half-past two, stepped into the Poultry.</p>

<p>It was not far to the Offices of the New Colliery Company in
Ironmonger Lane, where, and not at the Cannon Street Hotel, in
accordance with the more ambitious practice of other companies, the
General Meeting was always held. Old Jolyon had from the first set
his face against the Press. What business&mdash;he said&mdash;had
the Public with his concerns!</p>

<p>Soames arrived on the stroke of time, and took his seat
alongside the Board, who, in a row, each Director behind his own
ink-pot, faced their Shareholders.</p>

<p>In the centre of this row old Jolyon, conspicuous in his black,
tightly-buttoned frock-coat and his white moustaches, was leaning
back with finger tips crossed on a copy of the Directors' report
and accounts.</p>

<p>On his right hand, always a little larger than life, sat the
Secretary, 'Down-by-the-starn' Hemmings; an all-too-sad sadness
beaming in his fine eyes; his iron-grey beard, in mourning like the
rest of him, giving the feeling of an all-too-black tie behind
it.</p>

<p>The occasion indeed was a melancholy one, only six weeks having
elapsed since that telegram had come from Scorrier, the mining
expert, on a private mission to the Mines, informing them that
Pippin, their Superintendent, had committed suicide in
endeavouring, after his extraordinary two years' silence, to write
a letter to his Board. That letter was on the table now; it would
be read to the Shareholders, who would of course be put into
possession of all the facts.</p>

<p>Hemmings had often said to Soames, standing with his coat-tails
divided before the fireplace:</p>

<p>"What our Shareholders don't know about our affairs isn't worth
knowing. You may take that from me, Mr. Soames."</p>

<p>On one occasion, old Jolyon being present, Soames recollected a
little unpleasantness. His uncle had looked up sharply and said:
"Don't talk nonsense, Hemmings! You mean that what they do know
isn't worth knowing!" Old Jolyon detested humbug.</p>

<p>Hemmings, angry-eyed, and wearing a smile like that of a trained
poodle, had replied in an outburst of artificial applause: "Come,
now, that's good, sir&mdash;that's very good. Your uncle will have
his joke!"</p>

<p>The next time he had seen Soames he had taken the opportunity of
saying to him: "The chairman's getting very old!&mdash;I can't get
him to understand things; and he's so wilful&mdash;but what can you
expect, with a chin like his?"</p>

<p>Soames had nodded.</p>

<p>Everyone knew that Uncle Jolyon's chin was a caution. He was
looking worried to-day, in spite of his General Meeting look; he
(Soames) should certainly speak to him about Bosinney.</p>

<p>Beyond old Jolyon on the left was little Mr. Booker, and he,
too, wore his General Meeting look, as though searching for some
particularly tender shareholder. And next him was the deaf
director, with a frown; and beyond the deaf director, again, was
old Mr. Bleedham, very bland, and having an air of conscious
virtue&mdash;as well he might, knowing that the brown-paper parcel
he always brought to the Board-room was concealed behind his hat
(one of that old-fashioned class, of flat-brimmed top-hats which go
with very large bow ties, clean-shaven lips, fresh cheeks, and neat
little, white whiskers).</p>

<p>Soames always attended the General Meeting; it was considered
better that he should do so, in case 'anything should arise!' He
glanced round with his close, supercilious air at the walls of the
room, where hung plans of the mine and harbour, together with a
large photograph of a shaft leading to a working which had proved
quite remarkably unprofitable. This photograph&mdash;a witness to
the eternal irony underlying commercial enterprise till retained
its position on the&mdash;wall, an effigy of the directors' pet,
but dead, lamb.</p>

<p>And now old Jolyon rose, to present the report and accounts.</p>

<p>Veiling under a Jove-like serenity that perpetual antagonism
deep-seated in the bosom of a director towards his shareholders, he
faced them calmly. Soames faced them too. He knew most of them by
sight. There was old Scrubsole, a tar man, who always came, as
Hemmings would say, 'to make himself nasty,' a cantankerous-looking
old fellow with a red face, a jowl, and an enormous low-crowned hat
reposing on his knee. And the Rev. Mr. Boms, who always proposed a
vote of thanks to the chairman, in which he invariably expressed
the hope that the Board would not forget to elevate their
employees, using the word with a double e, as being more vigorous
and Anglo-Saxon (he had the strong Imperialistic tendencies of his
cloth). It was his salutary custom to buttonhole a director
afterwards, and ask him whether he thought the coming year would be
good or bad; and, according to the trend of the answer, to buy or
sell three shares within the ensuing fortnight.</p>

<p>And there was that military man, Major O'Bally, who could not
help speaking, if only to second the re-election of the auditor,
and who sometimes caused serious consternation by taking
toasts&mdash;proposals rather&mdash;out of the hands of persons who
had been flattered with little slips of paper, entrusting the said
proposals to their care.</p>

<p>These made up the lot, together with four or five strong, silent
shareholders, with whom Soames could sympathize&mdash;men of
business, who liked to keep an eye on their affairs for themselves,
without being fussy&mdash;good, solid men, who came to the City
every day and went back in the evening to good, solid wives.</p>

<p>Good, solid wives! There was something in that thought which
roused the nameless uneasiness in Soames again.</p>

<p>What should he say to his uncle? What answer should he make to
this letter?</p>

<p>..."If any shareholder has any question to put, I shall be glad
to answer it."</p>

<p>A soft thump. Old Jolyon had let the report and accounts fall,
and stood twisting his tortoise-shell glasses between thumb and
forefinger.</p>

<p>The ghost of a smile appeared on Soames' face. They had better
hurry up with their questions! He well knew his uncle's method (the
ideal one) of at once saying: "I propose, then, that the report and
accounts be adopted!" Never let them get their
wind&mdash;shareholders were notoriously wasteful of time!</p>

<p>A tall, white-bearded man, with a gaunt, dissatisfied face,
arose:</p>

<p>"I believe I am in order, Mr. Chairman, in raising a question on
this figure of L5000 in the accounts. 'To the widow and family,"'
(he looked sourly round), "'of our late superintendent,' who
so&mdash;er&mdash;ill-advisedly (I say&mdash;ill-advisedly)
committed suicide, at a time when his services were of the utmost
value to this Company. You have stated that the agreement which he
has so unfortunately cut short with his own hand was for a period
of five years, of which one only had expired&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"I believe I am in order, Mr. Chairman&mdash;I ask whether this
amount paid, or proposed to be paid, by the Board to the
er&mdash;deceased&mdash;is for services which might have been
rendered to the Company&mdash;had he not committed suicide?"</p>

<p>"It is in recognition of past services, which we all
know&mdash;you as well as any of us&mdash;to have been of vital
value."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, all I have to say is that the services being past,
the amount is too much."</p>

<p>The shareholder sat down.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon waited a second and said: "I now propose that the
report and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The shareholder rose again: "May I ask if the Board realizes
that it is not their money which&mdash;I don't hesitate to say that
if it were their money..."</p>

<p>A second shareholder, with a round, dogged face, whom Soames
recognised as the late superintendent's brother-in-law, got up and
said warmly: "In my opinion, sir, the sum is not enough!"</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Boms now rose to his feet. "If I may venture to
express myself," he said, "I should say that the fact of
the&mdash;er&mdash;deceased having committed suicide should weigh
very heavily&mdash;very heavily with our worthy chairman. I have no
doubt it has weighed with him, for&mdash;I say this for myself and
I think for everyone present (hear, hear)&mdash;he enjoys our
confidence in a high degree. We all desire, I should hope, to be
charitable. But I feel sure," (he-looked severely at the late
superintendent's brother-in-law) "that he will in some way, by some
written expression, or better perhaps by reducing the amount,
record our grave disapproval that so promising and valuable a life
should have been thus impiously removed from a sphere where both
its own interests and&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;our interests so
imperatively demanded its continuance. We should not&mdash;nay, we
may not&mdash;countenance so grave a dereliction of all duty, both
human and divine."</p>

<p>The reverend gentleman resumed his seat. The late
superintendent's brother-in-law again rose: "What I have said I
stick to," he said; "the amount is not enough!"</p>

<p>The first shareholder struck in: "I challenge the legality of
the payment. In my opinion this payment is not legal. The Company's
solicitor is present; I believe I am in order in asking him the
question."</p>

<p>All eyes were now turned upon Soames. Something had arisen!</p>

<p>He stood up, close-lipped and cold; his nerves inwardly
fluttered, his attention tweaked away at last from contemplation of
that cloud looming on the horizon of his mind.</p>

<p>"The point," he said in a low, thin voice, "is by no means
clear. As there is no possibility of future consideration being
received, it is doubtful whether the payment is strictly legal. If
it is desired, the opinion of the court could be taken."</p>

<p>The superintendent's brother-in-law frowned, and said in a
meaning tone: "We have no doubt the opinion of the court could be
taken. May I ask the name of the gentleman who has given us that
striking piece of information? Mr. Soames Forsyte? Indeed!" He
looked from Soames to old Jolyon in a pointed manner.</p>

<p>A flush coloured Soames' pale cheeks, but his superciliousness
did not waver. Old Jolyon fixed his eyes on the speaker.</p>

<p>"If," he said, "the late superintendents brother-in-law has
nothing more to say, I propose that the report and accounts..."</p>

<p>At this moment, however, there rose one of those five silent,
stolid shareholders, who had excited Soames' sympathy. He said:</p>

<p>"I deprecate the proposal altogether. We are expected to give
charity to this man's wife and children, who, you tell us, were
dependent on him. They may have been; I do not care whether they
were or not. I object to the whole thing on principle. It is high
time a stand was made against this sentimental humanitarianism. The
country is eaten up with it. I object to my money being paid to
these people of whom I know nothing, who have done nothing to earn
it. I object in toto; it is not business. I now move that the
report and accounts be put back, and amended by striking out the
grant altogether."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon had remained standing while the strong, silent man
was speaking. The speech awoke an echo in all hearts, voicing, as
it did, the worship of strong men, the movement against generosity,
which had at that time already commenced among the saner members of
the community.</p>

<p>The words 'it is not business' had moved even the Board;
privately everyone felt that indeed it was not. But they knew also
the chairman's domineering temper and tenacity. He, too, at heart
must feel that it was not business; but he was committed to his own
proposition. Would he go back upon it? It was thought to be
unlikely.</p>

<p>All waited with interest. Old Jolyon held up his hand;
dark-rimmed glasses depending between his finger and thumb quivered
slightly with a suggestion of menace.</p>

<p>He addressed the strong, silent shareholder.</p>

<p>"Knowing, as you do, the efforts of our late superintendent upon
the occasion of the explosion at the mines, do you seriously wish
me to put that amendment, sir?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon put the amendment.</p>

<p>"Does anyone second this?" he asked, looking calmly round.</p>

<p>And it was then that Soames, looking at his uncle, felt the
power of will that was in that old man. No one stirred. Looking
straight into the eyes of the strong, silent shareholder, old
Jolyon said:</p>

<p>"I now move, 'That the report and accounts for the year 1886 be
received and adopted.' You second that? Those in favour signify the
same in the usual way. Contrary&mdash;no. Carried. The next
business, gentlemen..."</p>

<p>Soames smiled. Certainly Uncle Jolyon had a way with him!</p>

<p>But now his attention relapsed upon Bosinney.</p>

<p>Odd how that fellow haunted his thoughts, even in business
hours.</p>

<p>Irene's visit to the house&mdash;but there was nothing in that,
except that she might have told him; but then, again, she never did
tell him anything. She was more silent, more touchy, every day. He
wished to God the house were finished, and they were in it, away
from London. Town did not suit her; her nerves were not strong
enough. That nonsense of the separate room had cropped up
again!</p>

<p>The meeting was breaking up now. Underneath the photograph of
the lost shaft Hemmings was buttonholed by the Rev. Mr. Boms.
Little Mr. Booker, his bristling eyebrows wreathed in angry smiles,
was having a parting turn-up with old Scrubsole. The two hated each
other like poison. There was some matter of a tar-contract between
them, little Mr. Booker having secured it from the Board for a
nephew of his, over old Scrubsole's head. Soames had heard that
from Hemmings, who liked a gossip, more especially about his
directors, except, indeed, old Jolyon, of whom he was afraid.</p>

<p>Soames awaited his opportunity. The last shareholder was
vanishing through the door, when he approached his uncle, who was
putting on his hat.</p>

<p>"Can I speak to you for a minute, Uncle Jolyon?"</p>

<p>It is uncertain what Soames expected to get out of this
interview.</p>

<p>Apart from that somewhat mysterious awe in which Forsytes in
general held old Jolyon, due to his philosophic twist, or
perhaps&mdash;as Hemmings would doubtless have said&mdash;to his
chin, there was, and always had been, a subtle antagonism between
the younger man and the old. It had lurked under their dry manner
of greeting, under their non-committal allusions to each other, and
arose perhaps from old Jolyon's perception of the quiet tenacity
('obstinacy,' he rather naturally called it) of the young man, of a
secret doubt whether he could get his own way with him.</p>

<p>Both these Forsytes, wide asunder as the poles in many respects,
possessed in their different ways&mdash;to a greater degree than
the rest of the family&mdash;that essential quality of tenacious
and prudent insight into 'affairs,' which is the highwater mark of
their great class. Either of them, with a little luck and
opportunity, was equal to a lofty career; either of them would have
made a good financier, a great contractor, a statesman, though old
Jolyon, in certain of his moods when under the influence of a cigar
or of Nature&mdash;would have been capable of, not perhaps
despising, but certainly of questioning, his own high position,
while Soames, who never smoked cigars, would not.</p>

<p>Then, too, in old Jolyon's mind there was always the secret
ache, that the son of James&mdash;of James, whom he had always
thought such a poor thing, should be pursuing the paths of success,
while his own son...!</p>

<p>And last, not least&mdash;for he was no more outside the
radiation of family gossip than any other Forsyte&mdash;he had now
heard the sinister, indefinite, but none the less disturbing rumour
about Bosinney, and his pride was wounded to the quick.</p>

<p>Characteristically, his irritation turned not against Irene but
against Soames. The idea that his nephew's wife (why couldn't the
fellow take better care of her&mdash;Oh! quaint injustice! as
though Soames could possibly take more care!)&mdash;should be
drawing to herself June's lover, was intolerably humiliating. And
seeing the danger, he did not, like James, hide it away in sheer
nervousness, but owned with the dispassion of his broader outlook,
that it was not unlikely; there was something very attractive about
Irene!</p>

<p>He had a presentiment on the subject of Soames' communication as
they left the Board Room together, and went out into the noise and
hurry of Cheapside. They walked together a good minute without
speaking, Soames with his mousing, mincing step, and old Jolyon
upright and using his umbrella languidly as a walking-stick.</p>

<p>They turned presently into comparative quiet, for old Jolyon's
way to a second Board led him in the direction of Moorage
Street.</p>

<p>Then Soames, without lifting his eyes, began: "I've had this
letter from Bosinney. You see what he says; I thought I'd let you
know. I've spent a lot more than I intended on this house, and I
want the position to be clear."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon ran his eyes unwillingly over the letter: "What he
says is clear enough," he said.</p>

<p>"He talks about 'a free hand,'" replied Soames.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon looked at him. The long-suppressed irritation and
antagonism towards this young fellow, whose affairs were beginning
to intrude upon his own, burst from him.</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't trust him, why do you employ him?"</p>

<p>Soames stole a sideway look: "It's much too late to go into
that," he said, "I only want it to be quite understood that if I
give him a free hand, he doesn't let me in. I thought if you were
to speak to him, it would carry more weight!"</p>

<p>"No," said old Jolyon abruptly; "I'll have nothing to do with
it!"</p>

<p>The words of both uncle and nephew gave the impression of
unspoken meanings, far more important, behind. And the look they
interchanged was like a revelation of this consciousness.</p>

<p>"Well," said Soames; "I thought, for June's sake, I'd tell you,
that's all; I thought you'd better know I shan't stand any
nonsense!"</p>

<p>"What is that to me?" old Jolyon took him up.</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know," said Soames, and flurried by that sharp look
he was unable to say more. "Don't say I didn't tell you," he added
sulkily, recovering his composure.</p>

<p>"Tell me!" said old Jolyon; "I don't know what you mean. You
come worrying me about a thing like this. I don't want to hear
about your affairs; you must manage them yourself!"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Soames immovably, "I will!"</p>

<p>"Good-morning, then," said old Jolyon, and they parted.</p>

<p>Soames retraced his steps, and going into a celebrated
eating-house, asked for a plate of smoked salmon and a glass of
Chablis; he seldom ate much in the middle of the day, and generally
ate standing, finding the position beneficial to his liver, which
was very sound, but to which he desired to put down all his
troubles.</p>

<p>When he had finished he went slowly back to his office, with
bent head, taking no notice of the swarming thousands on the
pavements, who in their turn took no notice of him.</p>

<p>The evening post carried the following reply to Bosinney:</p>

<blockquote>'FORSYTE, BUSTARD AND FORSYTE,<br>
'Commissioners for Oaths,<br>
'92001, BRANCH LANE, POULTRY, E.C.,<br>
'May 17, 1887.<br>
<br>
'DEAR BOSINNEY,<br>
<br>
'I have, received your letter, the terms of which not a little
surprise me. I was under the impression that you had, and have had
all along, a "free hand"; for I do not recollect that any
suggestions I have been so unfortunate as to make have met with
your approval. In giving you, in accordance with your request, this
"free hand," I wish you to clearly understand that the total cost
of the house as handed over to me completely decorated, inclusive
of your fee (as arranged between us), must not exceed twelve
thousand pounds&mdash;L12,000. This gives you an ample margin, and,
as you know, is far more than I originally contemplated.<br>
<br>
'I am,<br>
'Yours truly,<br>
'SOAMES FORSYTE.'</blockquote>

<p>On the following day he received a note from Bosinney:</p>

<blockquote>'PHILIP BAYNES BOSINNEY,<br>
'Architect,<br>
'309D, SLOANE STREET, S.W.,<br>
'May 18.<br>
<br>
'DEAR FORSYTE,<br>
<br>
'If you think that in such a delicate matter as decoration I can
bind myself to the exact pound, I am afraid you are mistaken. I can
see that you are tired of the arrangement, and of me, and I had
better, therefore, resign.<br>
<br>
'Yours faithfully,<br>
'PHILIP BAYNES BOSINNEY.'</blockquote>

<p>Soames pondered long and painfully over his answer, and late at
night in the dining-room, when Irene had gone to bed, he composed
the following:</p>

<blockquote>'62, MONTPELLIER SQUARE, S.W.,<br>
'May 19, 1887.<br>
'DEAR BOSINNEY,<br>
<br>
'I think that in both our interests it would be extremely
undesirable that matters should be so left at this stage. I did not
mean to say that if you should exceed the sum named in my letter to
you by ten or twenty or even fifty pounds, there would be any
difficulty between us. This being so, I should like you to
reconsider your answer. You have a "free hand" in the terms of this
correspondence, and I hope you will see your way to completing the
decorations, in the matter of which I know it is difficult to be
absolutely exact.<br>
<br>
'Yours truly,<br>
'SOAMES FORSYTE.'</blockquote>

<p>Bosinney's answer, which came in the course of the next day,
was:</p>

<blockquote>'May 20.<br>
'DEAR FORSYTE,<br>
'Very well.<br>
'PH. BOSINNEY.'</blockquote>

<h3>CHAPTER VI&mdash;OLD JOLYON AT THE ZOO</h3>

<p>Old Jolyon disposed of his second Meeting&mdash;an ordinary
Board&mdash;summarily. He was so dictatorial that his fellow
directors were left in cabal over the increasing domineeringness of
old Forsyte, which they were far from intending to stand much
longer, they said.</p>

<p>He went out by Underground to Portland Road Station, whence he
took a cab and drove to the Zoo.</p>

<p>He had an assignation there, one of those assignations that had
lately been growing more frequent, to which his increasing
uneasiness about June and the 'change in her,' as he expressed it,
was driving him.</p>

<p>She buried herself away, and was growing thin; if he spoke to
her he got no answer, or had his head snapped off, or she looked as
if she would burst into tears. She was as changed as she could be,
all through this Bosinney. As for telling him about anything, not a
bit of it!</p>

<p>And he would sit for long spells brooding, his paper unread
before him, a cigar extinct between his lips. She had been such a
companion to him ever since she was three years old! And he loved
her so!</p>

<p>Forces regardless of family or class or custom were beating down
his guard; impending events over which he had no control threw
their shadows on his head. The irritation of one accustomed to have
his way was roused against he knew not what.</p>

<p>Chafing at the slowness of his cab, he reached the Zoo door;
but, with his sunny instinct for seizing the good of each moment,
he forgot his vexation as he walked towards the tryst.</p>

<p>From the stone terrace above the bear-pit his son and his two
grandchildren came hastening down when they saw old Jolyon coming,
and led him away towards the lion-house. They supported him on
either side, holding one to each of his hands,&mdash;whilst Jolly,
perverse like his father, carried his grandfather's umbrella in
such a way as to catch people's legs with the crutch of the
handle.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon followed.</p>

<p>It was as good as a play to see his father with the children,
but such a play as brings smiles with tears behind. An old man and
two small children walking together can be seen at any hour of the
day; but the sight of old Jolyon, with Jolly and Holly seemed to
young Jolyon a special peep-show of the things that lie at the
bottom of our hearts. The complete surrender of that erect old
figure to those little figures on either hand was too poignantly
tender, and, being a man of an habitual reflex action, young Jolyon
swore softly under his breath. The show affected him in a way
unbecoming to a Forsyte, who is nothing if not undemonstrative.</p>

<p>Thus they reached the lion-house.</p>

<p>There had been a morning fete at the Botanical Gardens, and a
large number of Forsy...'&mdash;that is, of well-dressed people who
kept carriages had brought them on to the Zoo, so as to have more,
if possible, for their money, before going back to Rutland Gate or
Bryanston Square.</p>

<p>"Let's go on to the Zoo," they had said to each other; "it'll be
great fun!" It was a shilling day; and there would not be all those
horrid common people.</p>

<p>In front of the long line of cages they were collected in rows,
watching the tawny, ravenous beasts behind the bars await their
only pleasure of the four-and-twenty hours. The hungrier the beast,
the greater the fascination. But whether because the spectators
envied his appetite, or, more humanely, because it was so soon to
be satisfied, young Jolyon could not tell. Remarks kept falling on
his ears: "That's a nasty-looking brute, that tiger!" "Oh, what a
love! Look at his little mouth!" "Yes, he's rather nice! Don't go
too near, mother."</p>

<p>And frequently, with little pats, one or another would clap
their hands to their pockets behind and look round, as though
expecting young Jolyon or some disinterested-looking person to
relieve them of the contents.</p>

<p>A well-fed man in a white waistcoat said slowly through his
teeth: "It's all greed; they can't be hungry. Why, they take no
exercise." At these words a tiger snatched a piece of bleeding
liver, and the fat man laughed. His wife, in a Paris model frock
and gold nose-nippers, reproved him: "How can you laugh, Harry?
Such a horrid sight!"</p>

<p>Young Jolyon frowned.</p>

<p>The circumstances of his life, though he had ceased to take a
too personal view of them, had left him subject to an intermittent
contempt; and the class to which he had belonged&mdash;the carriage
class&mdash;especially excited his sarcasm.</p>

<p>To shut up a lion or tiger in confinement was surely a horrible
barbarity. But no cultivated person would admit this.</p>

<p>The idea of its being barbarous to confine wild animals had
probably never even occurred to his father for instance; he
belonged to the old school, who considered it at once humanizing
and educational to confine baboons and panthers, holding the view,
no doubt, that in course of time they might induce these creatures
not so unreasonably to die of misery and heart-sickness against the
bars of their cages, and put the society to the expense of getting
others! In his eyes, as in the eyes of all Forsytes, the pleasure
of seeing these beautiful creatures in a state of captivity far
outweighed the inconvenience of imprisonment to beasts whom God had
so improvidently placed in a state of freedom! It was for the
animals good, removing them at once from the countless dangers of
open air and exercise, and enabling them to exercise their
functions in the guaranteed seclusion of a private compartment!
Indeed, it was doubtful what wild animals were made for but to be
shut up in cages!</p>

<p>But as young Jolyon had in his constitution the elements of
impartiality, he reflected that to stigmatize as barbarity that
which was merely lack of imagination must be wrong; for none who
held these views had been placed in a similar position to the
animals they caged, and could not, therefore, be expected to enter
into their sensations. It was not until they were leaving the
gardens&mdash;Jolly and Holly in a state of blissful
delirium&mdash;that old Jolyon found an opportunity of speaking to
his son on the matter next his heart. "I don't know what to make of
it," he said; "if she's to go on as she's going on now, I can't
tell what's to come. I wanted her to see the doctor, but she won't.
She's not a bit like me. She's your mother all over. Obstinate as a
mule! If she doesn't want to do a thing, she won't, and there's an
end of it!"</p>

<p>Young Jolyon smiled; his eyes had wandered to his father's chin.
'A pair of you,' he thought, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>"And then," went on old Jolyon, "there's this Bosinney. I should
like to punch the fellow's head, but I can't, I suppose,
though&mdash;I don't see why you shouldn't," he added
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"What has he done? Far better that it should come to an end, if
they don't hit it off!"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon looked at his son. Now they had actually come to
discuss a subject connected with the relations between the sexes he
felt distrustful. Jo would be sure to hold some loose view or
other.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know what you think," he said; "I dare say your
sympathy's with him&mdash;shouldn't be surprised; but I think he's
behaving precious badly, and if he comes my way I shall tell him
so." He dropped the subject.</p>

<p>It was impossible to discuss with his son the true nature and
meaning of Bosinney's defection. Had not his son done the very same
thing (worse, if possible) fifteen years ago? There seemed no end
to the consequences of that piece of folly.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon also was silent; he had quickly penetrated his
father's thought, for, dethroned from the high seat of an obvious
and uncomplicated view of things, he had become both perceptive and
subtle.</p>

<p>The attitude he had adopted towards sexual matters fifteen years
before, however, was too different from his father's. There was no
bridging the gulf.</p>

<p>He said coolly: "I suppose he's fallen in love with some other
woman?"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon gave him a dubious look: "I can't tell," he said;
"they say so!"</p>

<p>"Then, it's probably true," remarked young Jolyon unexpectedly;
"and I suppose they've told you who she is?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said old Jolyon, "Soames's wife!"</p>

<p>Young Jolyon did not whistle: The circumstances of his own life
had rendered him incapable of whistling on such a subject, but he
looked at his father, while the ghost of a smile hovered over his
face.</p>

<p>If old Jolyon saw, he took no notice.</p>

<p>"She and June were bosom friends!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Poor little June!" said young Jolyon softly. He thought of his
daughter still as a babe of three.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon came to a sudden halt.</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it," he said, "it's some old woman's
tale. Get me a cab, Jo, I'm tired to death!"</p>

<p>They stood at a corner to see if an empty cab would come along,
while carriage after carriage drove past, bearing Forsytes of all
descriptions from the Zoo. The harness, the liveries, the gloss on
the horses' coats, shone and glittered in the May sunlight, and
each equipage, landau, sociable, barouche, Victoria, or brougham,
seemed to roll out proudly from its wheels:</p>

<p>'I and my horses and my men you know,' Indeed the whole turn-out
have cost a pot. But we were worth it every penny. Look At Master
and at Missis now, the dawgs! Ease with security&mdash;ah! that's
the ticket!</p>

<p>And such, as everyone knows, is fit accompaniment for a
perambulating Forsyte.</p>

<p>Amongst these carriages was a barouche coming at a greater pace
than the others, drawn by a pair of bright bay horses. It swung on
its high springs, and the four people who filled it seemed rocked
as in a cradle.</p>

<p>This chariot attracted young Jolyon's attention; and suddenly,
on the back seat, he recognised his Uncle James, unmistakable in
spite of the increased whiteness of his whiskers; opposite, their
backs defended by sunshades, Rachel Forsyte and her elder but
married sister, Winifred Dartie, in irreproachable toilettes, had
posed their heads haughtily, like two of the birds they had been
seeing at the Zoo; while by James' side reclined Dartie, in a
brand-new frock-coat buttoned tight and square, with a large
expanse of carefully shot linen protruding below each
wristband.</p>

<p>An extra, if subdued, sparkle, an added touch of the best gloss
or varnish characterized this vehicle, and seemed to distinguish it
from all the others, as though by some happy
extravagance&mdash;like that which marks out the real 'work of art'
from the ordinary 'picture'&mdash;it were designated as the typical
car, the very throne of Forsytedom.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon did not see them pass; he was petting poor Holly who
was tired, but those in the carriage had taken in the little group;
the ladies' heads tilted suddenly, there was a spasmodic screening
movement of parasols; James' face protruded naively, like the head
of a long bird, his mouth slowly opening. The shield-like rounds of
the parasols grew smaller and smaller, and vanished.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon saw that he had been recognised, even by Winifred,
who could not have been more than fifteen when he had forfeited the
right to be considered a Forsyte.</p>

<p>There was not much change in them! He remembered the exact look
of their turn-out all that time ago: Horses, men,
carriage&mdash;all different now, no doubt&mdash;but of the precise
stamp of fifteen years before; the same neat display, the same
nicely calculated arrogance ease with security! The swing exact,
the pose of the sunshades exact, exact the spirit of the whole
thing.</p>

<p>And in the sunlight, defended by the haughty shields of
parasols, carriage after carriage went by.</p>

<p>"Uncle James has just passed, with his female folk," said young
Jolyon.</p>

<p>His father looked black. "Did your uncle see us? Yes? Hmph!
What's he want, coming down into these parts?"</p>

<p>An empty cab drove up at this moment, and old Jolyon stopped
it.</p>

<p>"I shall see you again before long, my boy!" he said. "Don't you
go paying any attention to what I've been saying about young
Bosinney&mdash;I don't believe a word of it!"</p>

<p>Kissing the children, who tried to detain him, he stepped in and
was borne away.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon, who had taken Holly up in his arms, stood
motionless at the corner, looking after the cab.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER VII&mdash;AFTERNOON AT TIMOTHY'S</h3>

<p>If old Jolyon, as he got into his cab, had said: 'I won't
believe a word of it!' he would more truthfully have expressed his
sentiments.</p>

<p>The notion that James and his womankind had seen him in the
company of his son had awakened in him not only the impatience he
always felt when crossed, but that secret hostility natural between
brothers, the roots of which&mdash;little nursery
rivalries&mdash;sometimes toughen and deepen as life goes on, and,
all hidden, support a plant capable of producing in season the
bitterest fruits.</p>

<p>Hitherto there had been between these six brothers no more
unfriendly feeling than that caused by the secret and natural doubt
that the others might be richer than themselves; a feeling
increased to the pitch of curiosity by the approach of
death&mdash;that end of all handicaps&mdash;and the great
'closeness' of their man of business, who, with some sagacity,
would profess to Nicholas ignorance of James' income, to James
ignorance of old Jolyon's, to Jolyon ignorance of Roger's, to Roger
ignorance of Swithin's, while to Swithin he would say most
irritatingly that Nicholas must be a rich man. Timothy alone was
exempt, being in gilt-edged securities.</p>

<p>But now, between two of them at least, had arisen a very
different sense of injury. From the moment when James had the
impertinence to pry into his affairs&mdash;as he put it&mdash;old
Jolyon no longer chose to credit this story about Bosinney. His
grand-daughter slighted through a member of 'that fellow's' family!
He made up his mind that Bosinney was maligned. There must be some
other reason for his defection.</p>

<p>June had flown out at him, or something; she was as touchy as
she could be!</p>

<p>He would, however, let Timothy have a bit of his mind, and see
if he would go on dropping hints! And he would not let the grass
grow under his feet either, he would go there at once, and take
very good care that he didn't have to go again on the same
errand.</p>

<p>He saw James' carriage blocking the pavement in front of 'The
Bower.' So they had got there before him&mdash;cackling about
having seen him, he dared say! And further on, Swithin's greys were
turning their noses towards the noses of James' bays, as though in
conclave over the family, while their coachmen were in conclave
above.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon, depositing his hat on the chair in the narrow hall,
where that hat of Bosinney's had so long ago been mistaken for a
cat, passed his thin hand grimly over his face with its great
drooping white moustaches, as though to remove all traces of
expression, and made his way upstairs.</p>

<p>He found the front drawing-room full. It was full enough at the
best of times&mdash;without visitors&mdash;without any one in
it&mdash;for Timothy and his sisters, following the tradition of
their generation, considered that a room was not quite 'nice'
unless it was 'properly' furnished. It held, therefore, eleven
chairs, a sofa, three tables, two cabinets, innumerable knicknacks,
and part of a large grand piano. And now, occupied by Mrs. Small,
Aunt Hester, by Swithin, James, Rachel, Winifred, Euphemia, who had
come in again to return 'Passion and Paregoric' which she had read
at lunch, and her chum Frances, Roger's daughter (the musical
Forsyte, the one who composed songs), there was only one chair left
unoccupied, except, of course, the two that nobody ever sat
on&mdash;and the only standing room was occupied by the cat, on
whom old Jolyon promptly stepped.</p>

<p>In these days it was by no means unusual for Timothy to have so
many visitors. The family had always, one and all, had a real
respect for Aunt Ann, and now that she was gone, they were coming
far more frequently to The Bower, and staying longer.</p>

<p>Swithin had been the first to arrive, and seated torpid in a red
satin chair with a gilt back, he gave every appearance of lasting
the others out. And symbolizing Bosinney's name 'the big one,' with
his great stature and bulk, his thick white hair, his puffy
immovable shaven face, he looked more primeval than ever in the
highly upholstered room.</p>

<p>His conversation, as usual of late, had turned at once upon
Irene, and he had lost no time in giving Aunts Juley and Hester his
opinion with regard to this rumour he heard was going about.
No&mdash;as he said&mdash;she might want a bit of
flirtation&mdash;a pretty woman must have her fling; but more than
that he did not believe. Nothing open; she had too much good sense,
too much proper appreciation of what was due to her position, and
to the family! No sc&mdash;, he was going to say 'scandal' but the
very idea was so preposterous that he waved his hand as though to
say&mdash;'but let that pass!'</p>

<p>Granted that Swithin took a bachelor's view of the
situation&mdash;still what indeed was not due to that family in
which so many had done so well for themselves, had attained a
certain position? If he had heard in dark, pessimistic moments the
words 'yeomen' and 'very small beer' used in connection with his
origin, did he believe them?</p>

<p>No! he cherished, hugging it pathetically to his bosom the
secret theory that there was something distinguished somewhere in
his ancestry.</p>

<p>"Must be," he once said to young Jolyon, before the latter went
to the bad. "Look at us, we've got on! There must be good blood in
us somewhere."</p>

<p>He had been fond of young Jolyon: the boy had been in a good set
at College, had known that old ruffian Sir Charles Fiste's
sons&mdash;a pretty rascal one of them had turned out, too; and
there was style about him&mdash;it was a thousand pities he had run
off with that half-foreign governess! If he must go off like that
why couldn't he have chosen someone who would have done them
credit! And what was he now?&mdash;an underwriter at Lloyd's; they
said he even painted pictures&mdash;pictures! Damme! he might have
ended as Sir Jolyon Forsyte, Bart., with a seat in Parliament, and
a place in the country!</p>

<p>It was Swithin who, following the impulse which sooner or later
urges thereto some member of every great family, went to the
Heralds' Office, where they assured him that he was undoubtedly of
the same family as the well-known Forsites with an 'i,' whose arms
were 'three dexter buckles on a sable ground gules,' hoping no
doubt to get him to take them up.</p>

<p>Swithin, however, did not do this, but having ascertained that
the crest was a 'pheasant proper,' and the motto 'For Forsite,' he
had the pheasant proper placed upon his carriage and the buttons of
his coachman, and both crest and motto on his writing-paper. The
arms he hugged to himself, partly because, not having paid for
them, he thought it would look ostentatious to put them on his
carriage, and he hated ostentation, and partly because he, like any
practical man all over the country, had a secret dislike and
contempt for things he could not understand he found it hard, as
anyone might, to swallow 'three dexter buckles on a sable ground
gules.'</p>

<p>He never forgot, however, their having told him that if he paid
for them he would be entitled to use them, and it strengthened his
conviction that he was a gentleman. Imperceptibly the rest of the
family absorbed the 'pheasant proper,' and some, more serious than
others, adopted the motto; old Jolyon, however, refused to use the
latter, saying that it was humbug meaning nothing, so far as he
could see.</p>

<p>Among the older generation it was perhaps known at bottom from
what great historical event they derived their crest; and if
pressed on the subject, sooner than tell a lie&mdash;they did not
like telling lies, having an impression that only Frenchmen and
Russians told them&mdash;they would confess hurriedly that Swithin
had got hold of it somehow.</p>

<p>Among the younger generation the matter was wrapped in a
discretion proper. They did not want to hurt the feelings of their
elders, nor to feel ridiculous themselves; they simply used the
crest...</p>

<p>"No," said Swithin, "he had had an opportunity of seeing for
himself, and what he should say was, that there was nothing in her
manner to that young Buccaneer or Bosinney or whatever his name
was, different from her manner to himself; in fact, he should
rather say..." But here the entrance of Frances and Euphemia put an
unfortunate stop to the conversation, for this was not a subject
which could be discussed before young people.</p>

<p>And though Swithin was somewhat upset at being stopped like this
on the point of saying something important, he soon recovered his
affability. He was rather fond of Frances&mdash;Francie, as she was
called in the family. She was so smart, and they told him she made
a pretty little pot of pin-money by her songs; he called it very
clever of her.</p>

<p>He rather prided himself indeed on a liberal attitude towards
women, not seeing any reason why they shouldn't paint pictures, or
write tunes, or books even, for the matter of that, especially if
they could turn a useful penny by it; not at all&mdash;kept them
out of mischief. It was not as if they were men!</p>

<p>'Little Francie,' as she was usually called with good-natured
contempt, was an important personage, if only as a standing
illustration of the attitude of Forsytes towards the Arts. She was
not really 'little,' but rather tall, with dark hair for a Forsyte,
which, together with a grey eye, gave her what was called 'a Celtic
appearance.' She wrote songs with titles like 'Breathing Sighs,' or
'Kiss me, Mother, ere I die,' with a refrain like an anthem:</p>

<blockquote>'Kiss me, Mother, ere I die;<br>
Kiss me-kiss me, Mother, ah!<br>
Kiss, ah! kiss me e-ere I&mdash;<br>
Kiss me, Mother, ere I d-d-die!'</blockquote>

<p>She wrote the words to them herself, and other poems. In lighter
moments she wrote waltzes, one of which, the 'Kensington Coil,' was
almost national to Kensington, having a sweet dip in it.</p>

<p>It was very original. Then there were her 'Songs for Little
People,' at once educational and witty, especially 'Gran'ma's
Porgie,' and that ditty, almost prophetically imbued with the
coming Imperial spirit, entitled 'Black Him In His Little Eye.'</p>

<p>Any publisher would take these, and reviews like 'High Living,'
and the 'Ladies' Genteel Guide' went into raptures over: 'Another
of Miss Francie Forsyte's spirited ditties, sparkling and pathetic.
We ourselves were moved to tears and laughter. Miss Forsyte should
go far.'</p>

<p>With the true instinct of her breed, Francie had made a point of
knowing the right people&mdash;people who would write about her,
and talk about her, and people in Society, too&mdash;keeping a
mental register of just where to exert her fascinations, and an eye
on that steady scale of rising prices, which in her mind's eye
represented the future. In this way she caused herself to be
universally respected.</p>

<p>Once, at a time when her emotions were whipped by an
attachment&mdash;for the tenor of Roger's life, with its
whole-hearted collection of house property, had induced in his only
daughter a tendency towards passion&mdash;she turned to great and
sincere work, choosing the sonata form, for the violin. This was
the only one of her productions that troubled the Forsytes. They
felt at once that it would not sell.</p>

<p>Roger, who liked having a clever daughter well enough, and often
alluded to the amount of pocket-money she made for herself, was
upset by this violin sonata.</p>

<p>"Rubbish like that!" he called it. Francie had borrowed young
Flageoletti from Euphemia, to play it in the drawing-room at
Prince's Gardens.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Roger was right. It was rubbish,
but&mdash;annoying! the sort of rubbish that wouldn't sell. As
every Forsyte knows, rubbish that sells is not rubbish at
all&mdash;far from it.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of the sound common sense which fixed the
worth of art at what it would fetch, some of the
Forsytes&mdash;Aunt Hester, for instance, who had always been
musical&mdash;could not help regretting that Francie's music was
not 'classical'; the same with her poems. But then, as Aunt Hester
said, they didn't see any poetry nowadays, all the poems were
'little light things.'</p>

<p>There was nobody who could write a poem like 'Paradise Lost,' or
'Childe Harold'; either of which made you feel that you really had
read something. Still, it was nice for Francie to have something to
occupy her; while other girls were spending money shopping she was
making it!</p>

<p>And both Aunt Hester and Aunt Juley were always ready to listen
to the latest story of how Francie had got her price increased.</p>

<p>They listened now, together with Swithin, who sat pretending not
to, for these young people talked so fast and mumbled so, he never
could catch what they said.</p>

<p>"And I can't think," said Mrs. Septimus, "how you do it. I
should never have the audacity!"</p>

<p>Francie smiled lightly. "I'd much rather deal with a man than a
woman. Women are so sharp!"</p>

<p>"My dear," cried Mrs. Small, "I'm sure we're not."</p>

<p>Euphemia went off into her silent laugh, and, ending with the
squeak, said, as though being strangled: "Oh, you'll kill me some
day, auntie."</p>

<p>Swithin saw no necessity to laugh; he detested people laughing
when he himself perceived no joke. Indeed, he detested Euphemia
altogether, to whom he always alluded as 'Nick's daughter, what's
she called&mdash;the pale one?' He had just missed being her
god-father&mdash;indeed, would have been, had he not taken a firm
stand against her outlandish name. He hated becoming a godfather.
Swithin then said to Francie with dignity: "It's a fine
day&mdash;er&mdash;for the time of year." But Euphemia, who knew
perfectly well that he had refused to be her godfather, turned to
Aunt Hester, and began telling her how she had seen
Irene&mdash;Mrs. Soames&mdash;at the Church and Commercial
Stores.</p>

<p>"And Soames was with her?" said Aunt Hester, to whom Mrs. Small
had as yet had no opportunity of relating the incident.</p>

<p>"Soames with her? Of course not!"</p>

<p>"But was she all alone in London?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; there was Mr. Bosinney with her. She was perfectly
dressed."</p>

<p>But Swithin, hearing the name Irene, looked severely at
Euphemia, who, it is true, never did look well in a dress, whatever
she may have done on other occasions, and said:</p>

<p>"Dressed like a lady, I've no doubt. It's a pleasure to see
her."</p>

<p>At this moment James and his daughters were announced. Dartie,
feeling badly in want of a drink, had pleaded an appointment with
his dentist, and, being put down at the Marble Arch, had got into a
hansom, and was already seated in the window of his club in
Piccadilly.</p>

<p>His wife, he told his cronies, had wanted to take him to pay
some calls. It was not in his line&mdash;not exactly. Haw!</p>

<p>Hailing the waiter, he sent him out to the hall to see what had
won the 4.30 race. He was dog-tired, he said, and that was a fact;
had been drivin' about with his wife to 'shows' all the afternoon.
Had put his foot down at last. A fellow must live his own life.</p>

<p>At this moment, glancing out of the bay window&mdash;for he
loved this seat whence he could see everybody pass&mdash;his eye
unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, chanced to light on the
figure of Soames, who was mousing across the road from the Green
Park-side, with the evident intention of coming in, for he, too,
belonged to 'The Iseeum.'</p>

<p>Dartie sprang to his feet; grasping his glass, he muttered
something about 'that 4.30 race,' and swiftly withdrew to the
card-room, where Soames never came. Here, in complete isolation and
a dim light, he lived his own life till half past seven, by which
hour he knew Soames must certainly have left the club.</p>

<p>It would not do, as he kept repeating to himself whenever he
felt the impulse to join the gossips in the bay-window getting too
strong for him&mdash;it absolutely would not do, with finances as
low as his, and the 'old man' (James) rusty ever since that
business over the oil shares, which was no fault of his, to risk a
row with Winifred.</p>

<p>If Soames were to see him in the club it would be sure to come
round to her that he wasn't at the dentist's at all. He never knew
a family where things 'came round' so. Uneasily, amongst the green
baize card-tables, a frown on his olive coloured face, his check
trousers crossed, and patent-leather boots shining through the
gloom, he sat biting his forefinger, and wondering where the deuce
he was to get the money if Erotic failed to win the Lancashire
Cup.</p>

<p>His thoughts turned gloomily to the Forsytes. What a set they
were! There was no getting anything out of them&mdash;at least, it
was a matter of extreme difficulty. They were so d&mdash;&mdash;d
particular about money matters; not a sportsman amongst the lot,
unless it were George. That fellow Soames, for instance, would have
a ft if you tried to borrow a tenner from him, or, if he didn't
have a fit, he looked at you with his cursed supercilious smile, as
if you were a lost soul because you were in want of money.</p>

<p>And that wife of his (Dartie's mouth watered involuntarily), he
had tried to be on good terms with her, as one naturally would with
any pretty sister-in-law, but he would be cursed if the (he
mentally used a coarse word)&mdash;would have anything to say to
him&mdash;she looked at him, indeed, as if he were dirt&mdash;and
yet she could go far enough, he wouldn't mind betting. He knew
women; they weren't made with soft eyes and figures like that for
nothing, as that fellow Soames would jolly soon find out, if there
were anything in what he had heard about this Buccaneer Johnny.</p>

<p>Rising from his chair, Dartie took a turn across the room,
ending in front of the looking-glass over the marble chimney-piece;
and there he stood for a long time contemplating in the glass the
reflection of his face. It had that look, peculiar to some men, of
having been steeped in linseed oil, with its waxed dark moustaches
and the little distinguished commencements of side whiskers; and
concernedly he felt the promise of a pimple on the side of his
slightly curved and fattish nose.</p>

<p>In the meantime old Jolyon had found the remaining chair in
Timothy's commodious drawing-room. His advent had obviously put a
stop to the conversation, decided awkwardness having set in. Aunt
Juley, with her well-known kindheartedness, hastened to set people
at their ease again.</p>

<p>"Yes, Jolyon," she said, "we were just saying that you haven't
been here for a long time; but we mustn't be surprised. You're
busy, of course? James was just saying what a busy time of
year..."</p>

<p>"Was he?" said old Jolyon, looking hard at James. "It wouldn't
be half so busy if everybody minded their own business."</p>

<p>James, brooding in a small chair from which his knees ran
uphill, shifted his feet uneasily, and put one of them down on the
cat, which had unwisely taken refuge from old Jolyon beside
him.</p>

<p>"Here, you've got a cat here," he said in an injured voice,
withdrawing his foot nervously as he felt it squeezing into the
soft, furry body.</p>

<p>"Several," said old Jolyon, looking at one face and another; "I
trod on one just now."</p>

<p>A silence followed.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Small, twisting her fingers and gazing round with
'pathetic calm', asked: "And how is dear June?"</p>

<p>A twinkle of humour shot through the sternness of old Jolyon's
eyes. Extraordinary old woman, Juley! No one quite like her for
saying the wrong thing!</p>

<p>"Bad!" he said; "London don't agree with her&mdash;too many
people about, too much clatter and chatter by half." He laid
emphasis on the words, and again looked James in the face.</p>

<p>Nobody spoke.</p>

<p>A feeling of its being too dangerous to take a step in any
direction, or hazard any remark, had fallen on them all. Something
of the sense of the impending, that comes over the spectator of a
Greek tragedy, had entered that upholstered room, filled with those
white-haired, frock-coated old men, and fashionably attired women,
who were all of the same blood, between all of whom existed an
unseizable resemblance.</p>

<p>Not that they were conscious of it&mdash;the visits of such
fateful, bitter spirits are only felt.</p>

<p>Then Swithin rose. He would not sit there, feeling like
that&mdash;he was not to be put down by anyone! And, manoeuvring
round the room with added pomp, he shook hands with each
separately.</p>

<p>"You tell Timothy from me," he said, "that he coddles himself
too much!" Then, turning to Francie, whom he considered 'smart,' he
added: "You come with me for a drive one of these days." But this
conjured up the vision of that other eventful drive which had been
so much talked about, and he stood quite still for a second, with
glassy eyes, as though waiting to catch up with the significance of
what he himself had said; then, suddenly recollecting that he
didn't care a damn, he turned to old Jolyon: "Well, good-bye,
Jolyon! You shouldn't go about without an overcoat; you'll be
getting sciatica or something!" And, kicking the cat slightly with
the pointed tip of his patent leather boot, he took his huge form
away.</p>

<p>When he had gone everyone looked secretly at the others, to see
how they had taken the mention of the word 'drive'&mdash;the word
which had become famous, and acquired an overwhelming importance,
as the only official&mdash;so to speak&mdash;news in connection
with the vague and sinister rumour clinging to the family
tongue.</p>

<p>Euphemia, yielding to an impulse, said with a short laugh: "I'm
glad Uncle Swithin doesn't ask me to go for drives."</p>

<p>Mrs. Small, to reassure her and smooth over any little
awkwardness the subject might have, replied: "My dear, he likes to
take somebody well dressed, who will do him a little credit. I
shall never forget the drive he took me. It was an experience!" And
her chubby round old face was spread for a moment with a strange
contentment; then broke into pouts, and tears came into her eyes.
She was thinking of that long ago driving tour she had once taken
with Septimus Small.</p>

<p>James, who had relapsed into his nervous brooding in the little
chair, suddenly roused himself: "He's a funny fellow, Swithin," he
said, but in a half-hearted way.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon's silence, his stern eyes, held them all in a kind of
paralysis. He was disconcerted himself by the effect of his own
words&mdash;an effect which seemed to deepen the importance of the
very rumour he had come to scotch; but he was still angry.</p>

<p>He had not done with them yet&mdash;No, no&mdash;he would give
them another rub or two.</p>

<p>He did not wish to rub his nieces, he had no quarrel with
them&mdash;a young and presentable female always appealed to old
Jolyon's clemency&mdash;but that fellow James, and, in a less
degree perhaps, those others, deserved all they would get. And he,
too, asked for Timothy.</p>

<p>As though feeling that some danger threatened her younger
brother, Aunt Juley suddenly offered him tea: "There it is," she
said, "all cold and nasty, waiting for you in the back drawing
room, but Smither shall make you some fresh."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon rose: "Thank you," he said, looking straight at
James, "but I've no time for tea, and&mdash;scandal, and the rest
of it! It's time I was at home. Good-bye, Julia; good-bye, Hester;
good-bye, Winifred."</p>

<p>Without more ceremonious adieux, he marched out.</p>

<p>Once again in his cab, his anger evaporated, for so it ever was
with his wrath&mdash;when he had rapped out, it was gone. Sadness
came over his spirit. He had stopped their mouths, maybe, but at
what a cost! At the cost of certain knowledge that the rumour he
had been resolved not to believe was true. June was abandoned, and
for the wife of that fellow's son! He felt it was true, and
hardened himself to treat it as if it were not; but the pain he hid
beneath this resolution began slowly, surely, to vent itself in a
blind resentment against James and his son.</p>

<p>The six women and one man left behind in the little drawing-room
began talking as easily as might be after such an occurrence, for
though each one of them knew for a fact that he or she never talked
scandal, each one of them also knew that the other six did; all
were therefore angry and at a loss. James only was silent,
disturbed, to the bottom of his soul.</p>

<p>Presently Francie said: "Do you know, I think Uncle Jolyon is
terribly changed this last year. What do you think, Aunt
Hester?"</p>

<p>Aunt Hester made a little movement of recoil: "Oh, ask your Aunt
Julia!" she said; "I know nothing about it."</p>

<p>No one else was afraid of assenting, and James muttered gloomily
at the floor: "He's not half the man he was."</p>

<p>"I've noticed it a long time," went on Francie; "he's aged
tremendously."</p>

<p>Aunt Juley shook her head; her face seemed suddenly to have
become one immense pout.</p>

<p>"Poor dear Jolyon," she said, "somebody ought to see to it for
him!"</p>

<p>There was again silence; then, as though in terror of being left
solitarily behind, all five visitors rose simultaneously, and took
their departure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Small, Aunt Hester, and their cat were left once more
alone, the sound of a door closing in the distance announced the
approach of Timothy.</p>

<p>That evening, when Aunt Hester had just got off to sleep in the
back bedroom that used to be Aunt Juley's before Aunt Juley took
Aunt Ann's, her door was opened, and Mrs. Small, in a pink
night-cap, a candle in her hand, entered: "Hester!" she said.
"Hester!"</p>

<p>Aunt Hester faintly rustled the sheet.</p>

<p>"Hester," repeated Aunt Juley, to make quite sure that she had
awakened her, "I am quite troubled about poor dear Jolyon. What,"
Aunt Juley dwelt on the word, "do you think ought to be done?"</p>

<p>Aunt Hester again rustled the sheet, her voice was heard faintly
pleading: "Done? How should I know?"</p>

<p>Aunt Juley turned away satisfied, and closing the door with
extra gentleness so as not to disturb dear Hester, let it slip
through her fingers and fall to with a 'crack.'</p>

<p>Back in her own room, she stood at the window gazing at the moon
over the trees in the Park, through a chink in the muslin curtains,
close drawn lest anyone should see. And there, with her face all
round and pouting in its pink cap, and her eyes wet, she thought of
'dear Jolyon,' so old and so lonely, and how she could be of some
use to him; and how he would come to love her, as she had never
been loved since&mdash;since poor Septimus went away.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;DANCE AT ROGER'S</h3>

<p>Roger's house in Prince's Gardens was brilliantly alight. Large
numbers of wax candles had been collected and placed in cut-glass
chandeliers, and the parquet floor of the long, double drawing-room
reflected these constellations. An appearance of real spaciousness
had been secured by moving out all the furniture on to the upper
landings, and enclosing the room with those strange appendages of
civilization known as 'rout' seats. In a remote corner, embowered
in palms, was a cottage piano, with a copy of the 'Kensington Coil'
open on the music-stand.</p>

<p>Roger had objected to a band. He didn't see in the least what
they wanted with a band; he wouldn't go to the expense, and there
was an end of it. Francie (her mother, whom Roger had long since
reduced to chronic dyspepsia, went to bed on such occasions), had
been obliged to content herself with supplementing the piano by a
young man who played the cornet, and she so arranged with palms
that anyone who did not look into the heart of things might imagine
there were several musicians secreted there. She made up her mind
to tell them to play loud&mdash;there was a lot of music in a
cornet, if the man would only put his soul into it.</p>

<p>In the more cultivated American tongue, she was 'through' at
last&mdash;through that tortuous labyrinth of make-shifts, which
must be traversed before fashionable display can be combined with
the sound economy of a Forsyte. Thin but brilliant, in her
maize-coloured frock with much tulle about the shoulders, she went
from place to place, fitting on her gloves, and casting her eye
over it all.</p>

<p>To the hired butler (for Roger only kept maids) she spoke about
the wine. Did he quite understand that Mr. Forsyte wished a dozen
bottles of the champagne from Whiteley's to be put out? But if that
were finished (she did not suppose it would be, most of the ladies
would drink water, no doubt), but if it were, there was the
champagne cup, and he must do the best he could with that.</p>

<p>She hated having to say this sort of thing to a butler, it was
so <i>infra dig.</i>; but what could you do with father? Roger,
indeed, after making himself consistently disagreeable about the
dance, would come down presently, with his fresh colour and bumpy
forehead, as though he had been its promoter; and he would smile,
and probably take the prettiest woman in to supper; and at two
o'clock, just as they were getting into the swing, he would go up
secretly to the musicians and tell them to play 'God Save the
Queen,' and go away.</p>

<p>Francie devoutly hoped he might soon get tired, and slip off to
bed.</p>

<p>The three or four devoted girl friends who were staying in the
house for this dance had partaken with her, in a small, abandoned
room upstairs, of tea and cold chicken-legs, hurriedly served; the
men had been sent out to dine at Eustace's Club, it being felt that
they must be fed up.</p>

<p>Punctually on the stroke of nine arrived Mrs. Small alone. She
made elaborate apologies for the absence of Timothy, omitting all
mention of Aunt Hester, who, at the last minute, had said she could
not be bothered. Francie received her effusively, and placed her on
a rout seat, where she left her, pouting and solitary in
lavender-coloured satin&mdash;the first time she had worn colour
since Aunt Ann's death.</p>

<p>The devoted maiden friends came now from their rooms, each by
magic arrangement in a differently coloured frock, but all with the
same liberal allowance of tulle on the shoulders and at the
bosom&mdash;for they were, by some fatality, lean to a girl. They
were all taken up to Mrs. Small. None stayed with her more than a
few seconds, but clustering together talked and twisted their
programmes, looking secretly at the door for the first appearance
of a man.</p>

<p>Then arrived in a group a number of Nicholases, always
punctual&mdash;the fashion up Ladbroke Grove way; and close behind
them Eustace and his men, gloomy and smelling rather of smoke.</p>

<p>Three or four of Francie's lovers now appeared, one after the
other; she had made each promise to come early. They were all
clean-shaven and sprightly, with that peculiar kind of young-man
sprightliness which had recently invaded Kensington; they did not
seem to mind each other's presence in the least, and wore their
ties bunching out at the ends, white waistcoats, and socks with
clocks. All had handkerchiefs concealed in their cuffs. They moved
buoyantly, each armoured in professional gaiety, as though he had
come to do great deeds. Their faces when they danced, far from
wearing the traditional solemn look of the dancing Englishman, were
irresponsible, charming, suave; they bounded, twirling their
partners at great pace, without pedantic attention to the rhythm of
the music.</p>

<p>At other dancers they looked with a kind of airy
scorn&mdash;they, the light brigade, the heroes of a hundred
Kensington 'hops'&mdash;from whom alone could the right manner and
smile and step be hoped.</p>

<p>After this the stream came fast; chaperones silting up along the
wall facing the entrance, the volatile element swelling the eddy in
the larger room.</p>

<p>Men were scarce, and wallflowers wore their peculiar, pathetic
expression, a patient, sourish smile which seemed to say: "Oh, no!
don't mistake me, I know you are not coming up to me. I can hardly
expect that!" And Francie would plead with one of her lovers, or
with some callow youth: "Now, to please me, do let me introduce you
to Miss Pink; such a nice girl, really!" and she would bring him
up, and say: "Miss Pink&mdash;Mr. Gathercole. Can you spare him a
dance?" Then Miss Pink, smiling her forced smile, colouring a
little, answered: "Oh! I think so!" and screening her empty card,
wrote on it the name of Gathercole, spelling it passionately in the
district that he proposed, about the second extra.</p>

<p>But when the youth had murmured that it was hot, and passed, she
relapsed into her attitude of hopeless expectation, into her
patient, sourish smile.</p>

<p>Mothers, slowly fanning their faces, watched their daughters,
and in their eyes could be read all the story of those daughters'
fortunes. As for themselves, to sit hour after hour, dead tired,
silent, or talking spasmodically&mdash;what did it matter, so long
as the girls were having a good time! But to see them neglected and
passed by! Ah! they smiled, but their eyes stabbed like the eyes of
an offended swan; they longed to pluck young Gathercole by the
slack of his dandified breeches, and drag him to their
daughters&mdash;the jackanapes!</p>

<p>And all the cruelties and hardness of life, its pathos and
unequal chances, its conceit, self-forgetfulness, and patience,
were presented on the battle-field of this Kensington
ball-room.</p>

<p>Here and there, too, lovers&mdash;not lovers like Francie's, a
peculiar breed, but simply lovers&mdash;trembling, blushing,
silent, sought each other by flying glances, sought to meet and
touch in the mazes of the dance, and now and again dancing
together, struck some beholder by the light in their eyes.</p>

<p>Not a second before ten o'clock came the Jameses&mdash;Emily,
Rachel, Winifred (Dartie had been left behind, having on a former
occasion drunk too much of Roger's champagne), and Cicely, the
youngest, making her debut; behind them, following in a hansom from
the paternal mansion where they had dined, Soames and Irene.</p>

<p>All these ladies had shoulder-straps and no tulle&mdash;thus
showing at once, by a bolder exposure of flesh, that they came from
the more fashionable side of the Park.</p>

<p>Soames, sidling back from the contact of the dancers, took up a
position against the wall. Guarding himself with his pale smile, he
stood watching. Waltz after waltz began and ended, couple after
couple brushed by with smiling lips, laughter, and snatches of
talk; or with set lips, and eyes searching the throng; or again,
with silent, parted lips, and eyes on each other. And the scent of
festivity, the odour of flowers, and hair, of essences that women
love, rose suffocatingly in the heat of the summer night.</p>

<p>Silent, with something of scorn in his smile, Soames seemed to
notice nothing; but now and again his eyes, finding that which they
sought, would fix themselves on a point in the shifting throng, and
the smile die off his lips.</p>

<p>He danced with no one. Some fellows danced with their wives; his
sense of 'form' had never permitted him to dance with Irene since
their marriage, and the God of the Forsytes alone can tell whether
this was a relief to him or not.</p>

<p>She passed, dancing with other men, her dress, iris-coloured,
floating away from her feet. She danced well; he was tired of
hearing women say with an acid smile: "How beautifully your wife
dances, Mr. Forsyte&mdash;it's quite a pleasure to watch her!"
Tired of answering them with his sidelong glance: "You think
so?"</p>

<p>A young couple close by flirted a fan by turns, making an
unpleasant draught. Francie and one of her lovers stood near. They
were talking of love.</p>

<p>He heard Roger's voice behind, giving an order about supper to a
servant. Everything was very second-class! He wished that he had
not come! He had asked Irene whether she wanted him; she had
answered with that maddening smile of hers "Oh, no!"</p>

<p>Why had he come? For the last quarter of an hour he had not even
seen her. Here was George advancing with his Quilpish face; it was
too late to get out of his way.</p>

<p>"Have you seen 'The Buccaneer'?" said this licensed wag; "he's
on the warpath&mdash;hair cut and everything!"</p>

<p>Soames said he had not, and crossing the room, half-empty in an
interval of the dance, he went out on the balcony, and looked down
into the street.</p>

<p>A carriage had driven up with late arrivals, and round the door
hung some of those patient watchers of the London streets who
spring up to the call of light or music; their faces, pale and
upturned above their black and rusty figures, had an air of stolid
watching that annoyed Soames. Why were they allowed to hang about;
why didn't the bobby move them on?</p>

<p>But the policeman took no notice of them; his feet were planted
apart on the strip of crimson carpet stretched across the pavement;
his face, under the helmet, wore the same stolid, watching look as
theirs.</p>

<p>Across the road, through the railings, Soames could see the
branches of trees shining, faintly stirring in the breeze, by the
gleam of the street lamps; beyond, again, the upper lights of the
houses on the other side, so many eyes looking down on the quiet
blackness of the garden; and over all, the sky, that wonderful
London sky, dusted with the innumerable reflection of countless
lamps; a dome woven over between its stars with the refraction of
human needs and human fancies&mdash;immense mirror of pomp and
misery that night after night stretches its kindly mocking over
miles of houses and gardens, mansions and squalor, over Forsytes,
policemen, and patient watchers in the streets.</p>

<p>Soames turned away, and, hidden in the recess, gazed into the
lighted room. It was cooler out there. He saw the new arrivals,
June and her grandfather, enter. What had made them so late? They
stood by the doorway. They looked fagged. Fancy Uncle Jolyon
turning out at this time of night! Why hadn't June come to Irene,
as she usually did, and it occurred to him suddenly that he had
seen nothing of June for a long time now.</p>

<p>Watching her face with idle malice, he saw it change, grow so
pale that he thought she would drop, then flame out crimson.
Turning to see at what she was looking, he saw his wife on
Bosinney's arm, coming from the conservatory at the end of the
room. Her eyes were raised to his, as though answering some
question he had asked, and he was gazing at her intently.</p>

<p>Soames looked again at June. Her hand rested on old Jolyon's
arm; she seemed to be making a request. He saw a surprised look on
his uncle's face; they turned and passed through the door out of
his sight.</p>

<p>The music began again&mdash;a waltz&mdash;and, still as a statue
in the recess of the window, his face unmoved, but no smile on his
lips, Soames waited. Presently, within a yard of the dark balcony,
his wife and Bosinney passed. He caught the perfume of the
gardenias that she wore, saw the rise and fall of her bosom, the
languor in her eyes, her parted lips, and a look on her face that
he did not know. To the slow, swinging measure they danced by, and
it seemed to him that they clung to each other; he saw her raise
her eyes, soft and dark, to Bosinney's, and drop them again.</p>

<p>Very white, he turned back to the balcony, and leaning on it,
gazed down on the Square; the figures were still there looking up
at the light with dull persistency, the policeman's face, too,
upturned, and staring, but he saw nothing of them. Below, a
carriage drew up, two figures got in, and drove away...</p>

<p>That evening June and old Jolyon sat down to dinner at the usual
hour. The girl was in her customary high-necked frock, old Jolyon
had not dressed.</p>

<p>At breakfast she had spoken of the dance at Uncle Roger's, she
wanted to go; she had been stupid enough, she said, not to think of
asking anyone to take her. It was too late now.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon lifted his keen eyes. June was used to go to dances
with Irene as a matter of course! and deliberately fixing his gaze
on her, he asked: "Why don't you get Irene?"</p>

<p>No! June did not want to ask Irene; she would only go
if&mdash;if her grandfather wouldn't mind just for once for a
little time!</p>

<p>At her look, so eager and so worn, old Jolyon had grumblingly
consented. He did not know what she wanted, he said, with going to
a dance like this, a poor affair, he would wager; and she no more
fit for it than a cat! What she wanted was sea air, and after his
general meeting of the Globular Gold Concessions he was ready to
take her. She didn't want to go away? Ah! she would knock herself
up! Stealing a mournful look at her, he went on with his
breakfast.</p>

<p>June went out early, and wandered restlessly about in the heat.
Her little light figure that lately had moved so languidly about
its business, was all on fire. She bought herself some flowers. She
wanted&mdash;she meant to look her best. He would be there! She
knew well enough that he had a card. She would show him that she
did not care. But deep down in her heart she resolved that evening
to win him back. She came in flushed, and talked brightly all
lunch; old Jolyon was there, and he was deceived.</p>

<p>In the afternoon she was overtaken by a desperate fit of
sobbing. She strangled the noise against the pillows of her bed,
but when at last it ceased she saw in the glass a swollen face with
reddened eyes, and violet circles round them. She stayed in the
darkened room till dinner time.</p>

<p>All through that silent meal the struggle went on within
her.</p>

<p>She looked so shadowy and exhausted that old Jolyon told
'Sankey' to countermand the carriage, he would not have her going
out...She was to go to bed! She made no resistance. She went up to
her room, and sat in the dark. At ten o'clock she rang for her
maid.</p>

<p>"Bring some hot water, and go down and tell Mr. Forsyte that I
feel perfectly rested. Say that if he's too tired I can go to the
dance by myself."</p>

<p>The maid looked askance, and June turned on her imperiously.
"Go," she said, "bring the hot water at once!"</p>

<p>Her ball-dress still lay on the sofa, and with a sort of fierce
care she arrayed herself, took the flowers in her hand, and went
down, her small face carried high under its burden of hair. She
could hear old Jolyon in his room as she passed.</p>

<p>Bewildered and vexed, he was dressing. It was past ten, they
would not get there till eleven; the girl was mad. But he dared not
cross her&mdash;the expression of her face at dinner haunted
him.</p>

<p>With great ebony brushes he smoothed his hair till it shone like
silver under the light; then he, too, came out on the gloomy
staircase.</p>

<p>June met him below, and, without a word, they went to the
carriage.</p>

<p>When, after that drive which seemed to last for ever, she
entered Roger's drawing-room, she disguised under a mask of
resolution a very torment of nervousness and emotion. The feeling
of shame at what might be called 'running after him' was smothered
by the dread that he might not be there, that she might not see him
after all, and by that dogged resolve&mdash;somehow, she did not
know how&mdash;to win him back.</p>

<p>The sight of the ballroom, with its gleaming floor, gave her a
feeling of joy, of triumph, for she loved dancing, and when dancing
she floated, so light was she, like a strenuous, eager little
spirit. He would surely ask her to dance, and if he danced with her
it would all be as it was before. She looked about her eagerly.</p>

<p>The sight of Bosinney coming with Irene from the conservatory,
with that strange look of utter absorption on his face, struck her
too suddenly. They had not seen&mdash;no one should see&mdash;her
distress, not even her grandfather.</p>

<p>She put her hand on Jolyon's arm, and said very low:</p>

<p>"I must go home, Gran; I feel ill."</p>

<p>He hurried her away, grumbling to himself that he had known how
it would be.</p>

<p>To her he said nothing; only when they were once more in the
carriage, which by some fortunate chance had lingered near the
door, he asked her: "What is it, my darling?"</p>

<p>Feeling her whole slender body shaken by sobs, he was terribly
alarmed. She must have Blank to-morrow. He would insist upon it. He
could not have her like this...There, there!</p>

<p>June mastered her sobs, and squeezing his hand feverishly, she
lay back in her corner, her face muffled in a shawl.</p>

<p>He could only see her eyes, fixed and staring in the dark, but
he did not cease to stroke her hand with his thin fingers.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER IX&mdash;EVENING AT RICHMOND</h3>

<p>Other eyes besides the eyes of June and of Soames had seen
'those two' (as Euphemia had already begun to call them) coming
from the conservatory; other eyes had noticed the look on
Bosinney's face.</p>

<p>There are moments when Nature reveals the passion hidden beneath
the careless calm of her ordinary moods&mdash;violent spring
flashing white on almond-blossom through the purple clouds; a
snowy, moonlit peak, with its single star, soaring up to the
passionate blue; or against the flames of sunset, an old yew-tree
standing dark guardian of some fiery secret.</p>

<p>There are moments, too, when in a picture-gallery, a work, noted
by the casual spectator as '...Titian&mdash;remarkably fine,'
breaks through the defences of some Forsyte better lunched perhaps
than his fellows, and holds him spellbound in a kind of ecstasy.
There are things, he feels&mdash;there are things here
which&mdash;well, which are things. Something unreasoning,
unreasonable, is upon him; when he tries to define it with the
precision of a practical man, it eludes him, slips away, as the
glow of the wine he has drunk is slipping away, leaving him cross,
and conscious of his liver. He feels that he has been extravagant,
prodigal of something; virtue has gone out of him. He did not
desire this glimpse of what lay under the three stars of his
catalogue. God forbid that he should know anything about the forces
of Nature! God forbid that he should admit for a moment that there
are such things! Once admit that, and where was he? One paid a
shilling for entrance, and another for the programme.</p>

<p>The look which June had seen, which other Forsytes had seen, was
like the sudden flashing of a candle through a hole in some
imaginary canvas, behind which it was being moved&mdash;the sudden
flaming-out of a vague, erratic glow, shadowy and enticing. It
brought home to onlookers the consciousness that dangerous forces
were at work. For a moment they noticed it with pleasure, with
interest, then felt they must not notice it at all.</p>

<p>It supplied, however, the reason of June's coming so late and
disappearing again without dancing, without even shaking hands with
her lover. She was ill, it was said, and no wonder.</p>

<p>But here they looked at each other guiltily. They had no desire
to spread scandal, no desire to be ill-natured. Who would have? And
to outsiders no word was breathed, unwritten law keeping them
silent.</p>

<p>Then came the news that June had gone to the seaside with old
Jolyon.</p>

<p>He had carried her off to Broadstairs, for which place there was
just then a feeling, Yarmouth having lost caste, in spite of
Nicholas, and no Forsyte going to the sea without intending to have
an air for his money such as would render him bilious in a week.
That fatally aristocratic tendency of the first Forsyte to drink
Madeira had left his descendants undoubtedly accessible.</p>

<p>So June went to the sea. The family awaited developments; there
was nothing else to do.</p>

<p>But how far&mdash;how far had 'those two' gone? How far were
they going to go? Could they really be going at all? Nothing could
surely come of it, for neither of them had any money. At the most a
flirtation, ending, as all such attachments should, at the proper
time.</p>

<p>Soames' sister, Winifred Dartie, who had imbibed with the
breezes of Mayfair&mdash;she lived in Green Street&mdash;more
fashionable principles in regard to matrimonial behaviour than were
current, for instance, in Ladbroke Grove, laughed at the idea of
there being anything in it. The 'little thing'&mdash;Irene was
taller than herself, and it was real testimony to the solid worth
of a Forsyte that she should always thus be a 'little
thing'&mdash;the little thing was bored. Why shouldn't she amuse
herself? Soames was rather tiring; and as to Mr.
Bosinney&mdash;only that buffoon George would have called him the
Buccaneer&mdash;she maintained that he was very chic.</p>

<p>This dictum&mdash;that Bosinney was chic&mdash;caused quit a
sensation. It failed to convince. That he was 'good-looking in a
way' they were prepared to admit, but that anyone could call a man
with his pronounced cheekbones, curious eyes, and soft felt hats
chic was only another instance of Winifred's extravagant way of
running after something new.</p>

<p>It was that famous summer when extravagance was fashionable,
when the very earth was extravagant, chestnut-trees spread with
blossom, and flowers drenched in perfume, as they had never been
before; when roses blew in every garden; and for the swarming stars
the nights had hardly space; when every day and all day long the
sun, in full armour, swung his brazen shield above the Park, and
people did strange things, lunching and dining in the open air.
Unprecedented was the tale of cabs and carriages that streamed
across the bridges of the shining river, bearing the upper-middle
class in thousands to the green glories of Bushey, Richmond, Kew,
and Hampton Court. Almost every family with any pretensions to be
of the carriage-class paid one visit that year to the
horse-chestnuts at Bushey, or took one drive amongst the Spanish
chestnuts of Richmond Park. Bowling smoothly, if dustily, along, in
a cloud of their own creation, they would stare fashionably at the
antlered heads which the great slow deer raised out of a forest of
bracken that promised to autumn lovers such cover as was never seen
before. And now and again, as the amorous perfume of chestnut
flowers and of fern was drifted too near, one would say to the
other: "My dear! What a peculiar scent!"</p>

<p>And the lime-flowers that year were of rare prime, near
honey-coloured. At the corners of London squares they gave out, as
the sun went down, a perfume sweeter than the honey bees had
taken&mdash;a perfume that stirred a yearning unnamable in the
hearts of Forsytes and their peers, taking the cool after dinner in
the precincts of those gardens to which they alone had keys.</p>

<p>And that yearning made them linger amidst the dim shapes of
flower-beds in the failing daylight, made them turn, and turn, and
turn again, as though lovers were waiting for them&mdash;waiting
for the last light to die away under the shadow of the
branches.</p>

<p>Some vague sympathy evoked by the scent of the limes, some
sisterly desire to see for herself, some idea of demonstrating the
soundness of her dictum that there was 'nothing in it'; or merely
the craving to drive down to Richmond, irresistible that summer,
moved the mother of the little Darties (of little Publius, of
Imogen, Maud, and Benedict) to write the following note to her
sister-in-law:</p>

<blockquote>'DEAR IRENE, 'June 30.<br>
<br>
'I hear that Soames is going to Henley tomorrow for the night. I
thought it would be great fun if we made up a little party and
drove down to, Richmond. Will you ask Mr. Bosinney, and I will get
young Flippard.<br>
<br>
'Emily (they called their mother Emily&mdash;it was so chic) will
lend us the carriage. I will call for you and your young man at
seven o'clock.<br>
<br>
'Your affectionate sister,<br>
'WINIFRED DARTIE.<br>
<br>
'Montague believes the dinner at the Crown and Sceptre to be quite
eatable.'</blockquote>

<p>Montague was Dartie's second and better known name&mdash;his
first being Moses; for he was nothing if not a man of the
world.</p>

<p>Her plan met with more opposition from Providence than so
benevolent a scheme deserved. In the first place young Flippard
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>'DEAR Mrs. DARTIE,<br>
<br>
'Awfully sorry. Engaged two deep.<br>
<br>
'Yours,<br>
'AUGUSTUS FLIPPARD.'</blockquote>

<p>It was late to send into the by-ways and hedges to remedy this
misfortune. With the promptitude and conduct of a mother, Winifred
fell back on her husband. She had, indeed, the decided but tolerant
temperament that goes with a good deal of profile, fair hair, and
greenish eyes. She was seldom or never at a loss; or if at a loss,
was always able to convert it into a gain.</p>

<p>Dartie, too, was in good feather. Erotic had failed to win the
Lancashire Cup. Indeed, that celebrated animal, owned as he was by
a pillar of the turf, who had secretly laid many thousands against
him, had not even started. The forty-eight hours that followed his
scratching were among the darkest in Dartie's life.</p>

<p>Visions of James haunted him day and night. Black thoughts about
Soames mingled with the faintest hopes. On the Friday night he got
drunk, so greatly was he affected. But on Saturday morning the true
Stock Exchange instinct triumphed within him. Owing some hundreds,
which by no possibility could he pay, he went into town and put
them all on Concertina for the Saltown Borough Handicap.</p>

<p>As he said to Major Scrotton, with whom he lunched at the
Iseeum: "That little Jew boy, Nathans, had given him the tip. He
didn't care a cursh. He wash in&mdash;a mucker. If it didn't come
up&mdash;well then, damme, the old man would have to pay!"</p>

<p>A bottle of Pol Roger to his own cheek had given him a new
contempt for James.</p>

<p>It came up. Concertina was squeezed home by her neck&mdash;a
terrible squeak! But, as Dartie said: There was nothing like
pluck!</p>

<p>He was by no means averse to the expedition to Richmond. He
would 'stand' it himself! He cherished an admiration for Irene, and
wished to be on more playful terms with her.</p>

<p>At half-past five the Park Lane footman came round to say: Mrs.
Forsyte was very sorry, but one of the horses was coughing!</p>

<p>Undaunted by this further blow, Winifred at once despatched
little Publius (now aged seven) with the nursery governess to
Montpellier Square.</p>

<p>They would go down in hansoms and meet at the Crown and Sceptre
at 7.45.</p>

<p>Dartie, on being told, was pleased enough. It was better than
going down with your back to the horses! He had no objection to
driving down with Irene. He supposed they would pick up the others
at Montpellier Square, and swop hansoms there?</p>

<p>Informed that the meet was at the Crown and Sceptre, and that he
would have to drive with his wife, he turned sulky, and said it was
d&mdash;&mdash;d slow!</p>

<p>At seven o'clock they started, Dartie offering to bet the driver
half-a-crown he didn't do it in the three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>Twice only did husband and wife exchange remarks on the way.</p>

<p>Dartie said: "It'll put Master Soames's nose out of joint to
hear his wife's been drivin' in a hansom with Master Bosinney!"</p>

<p>Winifred replied: "Don't talk such nonsense, Monty!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" repeated Dartie. "You don't know women, my fine
lady!"</p>

<p>On the other occasion he merely asked: "How am I looking? A bit
puffy about the gills? That fizz old George is so fond of is a
windy wine!"</p>

<p>He had been lunching with George Forsyte at the Haversnake.</p>

<p>Bosinney and Irene had arrived before them. They were standing
in one of the long French windows overlooking the river.</p>

<p>Windows that summer were open all day long, and all night too,
and day and night the scents of flowers and trees came in, the hot
scent of parching grass, and the cool scent of the heavy dews.</p>

<p>To the eye of the observant Dartie his two guests did not appear
to be making much running, standing there close together, without a
word. Bosinney was a hungry-looking creature&mdash;not much go
about him.</p>

<p>He left them to Winifred, however, and busied himself to order
the dinner.</p>

<p>A Forsyte will require good, if not delicate feeding, but a
Dartie will tax the resources of a Crown and Sceptre. Living as he
does, from hand to mouth, nothing is too good for him to eat; and
he will eat it. His drink, too, will need to be carefully provided;
there is much drink in this country 'not good enough' for a Dartie;
he will have the best. Paying for things vicariously, there is no
reason why he should stint himself. To stint yourself is the mark
of a fool, not of a Dartie.</p>

<p>The best of everything! No sounder principle on which a man can
base his life, whose father-in-law has a very considerable income,
and a partiality for his grandchildren.</p>

<p>With his not unable eye Dartie had spotted this weakness in
James the very first year after little Publius's arrival (an
error); he had profited by his perspicacity. Four little Darties
were now a sort of perpetual insurance.</p>

<p>The feature of the feast was unquestionably the red mullet. This
delectable fish, brought from a considerable distance in a state of
almost perfect preservation, was first fried, then boned, then
served in ice, with Madeira punch in place of sauce, according to a
recipe known to a few men of the world.</p>

<p>Nothing else calls for remark except the payment of the bill by
Dartie.</p>

<p>He had made himself extremely agreeable throughout the meal; his
bold, admiring stare seldom abandoning Irene's face and figure. As
he was obliged to confess to himself, he got no change out of
her&mdash;she was cool enough, as cool as her shoulders looked
under their veil of creamy lace. He expected to have caught her out
in some little game with Bosinney; but not a bit of it, she kept up
her end remarkably well. As for that architect chap, he was as glum
as a bear with a sore head&mdash;Winifred could barely get a word
out of him; he ate nothing, but he certainly took his liquor, and
his face kept getting whiter, and his eyes looked queer.</p>

<p>It was all very amusing.</p>

<p>For Dartie himself was in capital form, and talked freely, with
a certain poignancy, being no fool. He told two or three stories
verging on the improper, a concession to the company, for his
stories were not used to verging. He proposed Irene's health in a
mock speech. Nobody drank it, and Winifred said: "Don't be such a
clown, Monty!"</p>

<p>At her suggestion they went after dinner to the public terrace
overlooking the river.</p>

<p>"I should like to see the common people making love," she said,
"it's such fun!"</p>

<p>There were numbers of them walking in the cool, after the day's
heat, and the air was alive with the sound of voices, coarse and
loud, or soft as though murmuring secrets.</p>

<p>It was not long before Winifred's better sense&mdash;she was the
only Forsyte present&mdash;secured them an empty bench. They sat
down in a row. A heavy tree spread a thick canopy above their
heads, and the haze darkened slowly over the river.</p>

<p>Dartie sat at the end, next to him Irene, then Bosinney, then
Winifred. There was hardly room for four, and the man of the world
could feel Irene's arm crushed against his own; he knew that she
could not withdraw it without seeming rude, and this amused him; he
devised every now and again a movement that would bring her closer
still. He thought: 'That Buccaneer Johnny shan't have it all to
himself! It's a pretty tight fit, certainly!'</p>

<p>From far down below on the dark river came drifting the tinkle
of a mandoline, and voices singing the old round:</p>

<p>'A boat, a boat, unto the ferry, For we'll go over and be merry;
And laugh, and quaff, and drink brown sherry!'</p>

<p>And suddenly the moon appeared, young and tender, floating up on
her back from behind a tree; and as though she had breathed, the
air was cooler, but down that cooler air came always the warm odour
of the limes.</p>

<p>Over his cigar Dartie peered round at Bosinney, who was sitting
with his arms crossed, staring straight in front of him, and on his
face the look of a man being tortured.</p>

<p>And Dartie shot a glance at the face between, so veiled by the
overhanging shadow that it was but like a darker piece of the
darkness shaped and breathed on; soft, mysterious, enticing.</p>

<p>A hush had fallen on the noisy terrace, as if all the strollers
were thinking secrets too precious to be spoken.</p>

<p>And Dartie thought: 'Women!'</p>

<p>The glow died above the river, the singing ceased; the young
moon hid behind a tree, and all was dark. He pressed himself
against Irene.</p>

<p>He was not alarmed at the shuddering that ran through the limbs
he touched, or at the troubled, scornful look of her eyes. He felt
her trying to draw herself away, and smiled.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the man of the world had drunk quite
as much as was good for him.</p>

<p>With thick lips parted under his well-curled moustaches, and his
bold eyes aslant upon her, he had the malicious look of a
satyr.</p>

<p>Along the pathway of sky between the hedges of the tree tops the
stars clustered forth; like mortals beneath, they seemed to shift
and swarm and whisper. Then on the terrace the buzz broke out once
more, and Dartie thought: 'Ah! he's a poor, hungry-looking devil,
that Bosinney!' and again he pressed himself against Irene.</p>

<p>The movement deserved a better success. She rose, and they all
followed her.</p>

<p>The man of the world was more than ever determined to see what
she was made of. Along the terrace he kept close at her elbow. He
had within him much good wine. There was the long drive home, the
long drive and the warm dark and the pleasant closeness of the
hansom cab&mdash;with its insulation from the world devised by some
great and good man. That hungry architect chap might drive with his
wife&mdash;he wished him joy of her! And, conscious that his voice
was not too steady, he was careful not to speak; but a smile had
become fixed on his thick lips.</p>

<p>They strolled along toward the cabs awaiting them at the farther
end. His plan had the merit of all great plans, an almost brutal
simplicity he would merely keep at her elbow till she got in, and
get in quickly after her.</p>

<p>But when Irene reached the cab she did not get in; she slipped,
instead, to the horse's head. Dartie was not at the moment
sufficiently master of his legs to follow. She stood stroking the
horse's nose, and, to his annoyance, Bosinney was at her side
first. She turned and spoke to him rapidly, in a low voice; the
words 'That man' reached Dartie. He stood stubbornly by the cab
step, waiting for her to come back. He knew a trick worth two of
that!</p>

<p>Here, in the lamp-light, his figure (no more than medium
height), well squared in its white evening waistcoat, his light
overcoat flung over his arm, a pink flower in his button-hole, and
on his dark face that look of confident, good-humoured insolence,
he was at his best&mdash;a thorough man of the world.</p>

<p>Winifred was already in her cab. Dartie reflected that Bosinney
would have a poorish time in that cab if he didn't look sharp!
Suddenly he received a push which nearly overturned him in the
road. Bosinney's voice hissed in his ear: "I am taking Irene back;
do you understand?" He saw a face white with passion, and eyes that
glared at him like a wild cat's.</p>

<p>"Eh?" he stammered. "What? Not a bit. You take my wife!"</p>

<p>"Get away!" hissed Bosinney&mdash;"or I'll throw you into the
road!"</p>

<p>Dartie recoiled; he saw as plainly as possible that the fellow
meant it. In the space he made Irene had slipped by, her dress
brushed his legs. Bosinney stepped in after her.</p>

<p>"Go on!" he heard the Buccaneer cry. The cabman flicked his
horse. It sprang forward.</p>

<p>Dartie stood for a moment dumbfounded; then, dashing at the cab
where his wife sat, he scrambled in.</p>

<p>"Drive on!" he shouted to the driver, "and don't you lose sight
of that fellow in front!"</p>

<p>Seated by his wife's side, he burst into imprecations. Calming
himself at last with a supreme effort, he added: "A pretty mess
you've made of it, to let the Buccaneer drive home with her; why on
earth couldn't you keep hold of him? He's mad with love; any fool
can see that!"</p>

<p>He drowned Winifred's rejoinder with fresh calls to the
Almighty; nor was it until they reached Barnes that he ceased a
Jeremiad, in the course of which he had abused her, her father, her
brother, Irene, Bosinney, the name of Forsyte, his own children,
and cursed the day when he had ever married.</p>

<p>Winifred, a woman of strong character, let him have his say, at
the end of which he lapsed into sulky silence. His angry eyes never
deserted the back of that cab, which, like a lost chance, haunted
the darkness in front of him.</p>

<p>Fortunately he could not hear Bosinney's passionate
pleading&mdash;that pleading which the man of the world's conduct
had let loose like a flood; he could not see Irene shivering, as
though some garment had been torn from her, nor her eyes, black and
mournful, like the eyes of a beaten child. He could not hear
Bosinney entreating, entreating, always entreating; could not hear
her sudden, soft weeping, nor see that poor, hungry-looking devil,
awed and trembling, humbly touching her hand.</p>

<p>In Montpellier Square their cabman, following his instructions
to the letter, faithfully drew up behind the cab in front. The
Darties saw Bosinney spring out, and Irene follow, and hasten up
the steps with bent head. She evidently had her key in her hand,
for she disappeared at once. It was impossible to tell whether she
had turned to speak to Bosinney.</p>

<p>The latter came walking past their cab; both husband and wife
had an admirable view of his face in the light of a street lamp. It
was working with violent emotion.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Mr. Bosinney!" called Winifred.</p>

<p>Bosinney started, clawed off his hat, and hurried on. He had
obviously forgotten their existence.</p>

<p>"There!" said Dartie, "did you see the beast's face? What did I
say? Fine games!" He improved the occasion.</p>

<p>There had so clearly been a crisis in the cab that Winifred was
unable to defend her theory.</p>

<p>She said: "I shall say nothing about it. I don't see any use in
making a fuss!"</p>

<p>With that view Dartie at once concurred; looking upon James as a
private preserve, he disapproved of his being disturbed by the
troubles of others.</p>

<p>"Quite right," he said; "let Soames look after himself. He's
jolly well able to!"</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the Darties entered their habitat in Green
Street, the rent of which was paid by James, and sought a
well-earned rest. The hour was midnight, and no Forsytes remained
abroad in the streets to spy out Bosinney's wanderings; to see him
return and stand against the rails of the Square garden, back from
the glow of the street lamp; to see him stand there in the shadow
of trees, watching the house where in the dark was hidden she whom
he would have given the world to see for a single minute&mdash;she
who was now to him the breath of the lime-trees, the meaning of the
light and the darkness, the very beating of his own heart.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X&mdash;DIAGNOSIS OF A FORSYTE</h3>

<p>It is in the nature of a Forsyte to be ignorant that he is a
Forsyte; but young Jolyon was well aware of being one. He had not
known it till after the decisive step which had made him an
outcast; since then the knowledge had been with him continually. He
felt it throughout his alliance, throughout all his dealings with
his second wife, who was emphatically not a Forsyte.</p>

<p>He knew that if he had not possessed in great measure the eye
for what he wanted, the tenacity to hold on to it, the sense of the
folly of wasting that for which he had given so big a
price&mdash;in other words, the 'sense of property' he could never
have retained her (perhaps never would have desired to retain her)
with him through all the financial troubles, slights, and
misconstructions of those fifteen years; never have induced her to
marry him on the death of his first wife; never have lived it all
through, and come up, as it were, thin, but smiling.</p>

<p>He was one of those men who, seated cross-legged like miniature
Chinese idols in the cages of their own hearts, are ever smiling at
themselves a doubting smile. Not that this smile, so intimate and
eternal, interfered with his actions, which, like his chin and his
temperament, were quite a peculiar blend of softness and
determination.</p>

<p>He was conscious, too, of being a Forsyte in his work, that
painting of water-colours to which he devoted so much energy,
always with an eye on himself, as though he could not take so
unpractical a pursuit quite seriously, and always with a certain
queer uneasiness that he did not make more money at it.</p>

<p>It was, then, this consciousness of what it meant to be a
Forsyte, that made him receive the following letter from old
Jolyon, with a mixture of sympathy and disgust:</p>

<blockquote>'SHELDRAKE HOUSE,<br>
'BROADSTAIRS,<br>
'July 1. 'MY DEAR JO,'<br>
<br>
(The Dad's handwriting had altered very little in the thirty odd
years that he remembered it.)<br>
<br>
'We have been here now a fortnight, and have had good weather on
the whole. The air is bracing, but my liver is out of order, and I
shall be glad enough to get back to town. I cannot say much for
June, her health and spirits are very indifferent, and I don't see
what is to come of it. She says nothing, but it is clear that she
is harping on this engagement, which is an engagement and no
engagement, and&mdash;goodness knows what. I have grave doubts
whether she ought to be allowed to return to London in the present
state of affairs, but she is so self-willed that she might take it
into her head to come up at any moment. The fact is someone ought
to speak to Bosinney and ascertain what he means. I'm afraid of
this myself, for I should certainly rap him over the knuckles, but
I thought that you, knowing him at the Club, might put in a word,
and get to ascertain what the fellow is about. You will of course
in no way commit June. I shall be glad to hear from you in the
course of a few days whether you have succeeded in gaining any
information. The situation is very distressing to me, I worry about
it at night.<br>
<br>
With my love to Jolly and Holly.<br>
<br>
'I am,<br>
'Your affect. father,<br>
'JOLYON FORSYTE.'</blockquote>

<p>Young Jolyon pondered this letter so long and seriously that his
wife noticed his preoccupation, and asked him what was the matter.
He replied: "Nothing."</p>

<p>It was a fixed principle with him never to allude to June. She
might take alarm, he did not know what she might think; he
hastened, therefore, to banish from his manner all traces of
absorption, but in this he was about as successful as his father
would have been, for he had inherited all old Jolyon's transparency
in matters of domestic finesse; and young Mrs. Jolyon, busying
herself over the affairs of the house, went about with tightened
lips, stealing at him unfathomable looks.</p>

<p>He started for the Club in the afternoon with the letter in his
pocket, and without having made up his mind.</p>

<p>To sound a man as to 'his intentions' was peculiarly unpleasant
to him; nor did his own anomalous position diminish this
unpleasantness. It was so like his family, so like all the people
they knew and mixed with, to enforce what they called their rights
over a man, to bring him up to the mark; so like them to carry
their business principles into their private relations.</p>

<p>And how that phrase in the letter&mdash;'You will, of course, in
no way commit June'&mdash;gave the whole thing away.</p>

<p>Yet the letter, with the personal grievance, the concern for
June, the 'rap over the knuckles,' was all so natural. No wonder
his father wanted to know what Bosinney meant, no wonder he was
angry.</p>

<p>It was difficult to refuse! But why give the thing to him to do?
That was surely quite unbecoming; but so long as a Forsyte got what
he was after, he was not too particular about the means, provided
appearances were saved.</p>

<p>How should he set about it, or how refuse? Both seemed
impossible. So, young Jolyon!</p>

<p>He arrived at the Club at three o'clock, and the first person he
saw was Bosinney himself, seated in a corner, staring out of the
window.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon sat down not far off, and began nervously to
reconsider his position. He looked covertly at Bosinney sitting
there unconscious. He did not know him very well, and studied him
attentively for perhaps the first time; an unusual looking man,
unlike in dress, face, and manner to most of the other members of
the Club&mdash;young Jolyon himself, however different he had
become in mood and temper, had always retained the neat reticence
of Forsyte appearance. He alone among Forsytes was ignorant of
Bosinney's nickname. The man was unusual, not eccentric, but
unusual; he looked worn, too, haggard, hollow in the cheeks beneath
those broad, high cheekbones, though without any appearance of
ill-health, for he was strongly built, with curly hair that seemed
to show all the vitality of a fine constitution.</p>

<p>Something in his face and attitude touched young Jolyon. He knew
what suffering was like, and this man looked as if he were
suffering.</p>

<p>He got up and touched his arm.</p>

<p>Bosinney started, but exhibited no sign of embarrassment on
seeing who it was.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon sat down.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen you for a long time," he said. "How are you
getting on with my cousin's house?"</p>

<p>"It'll be finished in about a week."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you!"</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;I don't know that it's much of a subject for
congratulation."</p>

<p>"No?" queried young Jolyon; "I should have thought you'd be glad
to get a long job like that off your hands; but I suppose you feel
it much as I do when I part with a picture&mdash;a sort of
child?"</p>

<p>He looked kindly at Bosinney.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the latter more cordially, "it goes out from you and
there's an end of it. I didn't know you painted."</p>

<p>"Only water-colours; I can't say I believe in my work."</p>

<p>"Don't believe in it? There&mdash;how can you do it? Work's no
use unless you believe in it!"</p>

<p>"Good," said young Jolyon; "it's exactly what I've always said.
By-the-bye, have you noticed that whenever one says 'Good,' one
always adds 'it's exactly what I've always said'! But if you ask me
how I do it, I answer, because I'm a Forsyte."</p>

<p>"A Forsyte! I never thought of you as one!"</p>

<p>"A Forsyte," replied young Jolyon, "is not an uncommon animal.
There are hundreds among the members of this Club. Hundreds out
there in the streets; you meet them wherever you go!"</p>

<p>"And how do you tell them, may I ask?" said Bosinney.</p>

<p>"By their sense of property. A Forsyte takes a
practical&mdash;one might say a commonsense&mdash;view of things,
and a practical view of things is based fundamentally on a sense of
property. A Forsyte, you will notice, never gives himself
away."</p>

<p>"Joking?"</p>

<p>Young Jolyon's eye twinkled.</p>

<p>"Not much. As a Forsyte myself, I have no business to talk. But
I'm a kind of thoroughbred mongrel; now, there's no mistaking you:
You're as different from me as I am from my Uncle James, who is the
perfect specimen of a Forsyte. His sense of property is extreme,
while you have practically none. Without me in between, you would
seem like a different species. I'm the missing link. We are, of
course, all of us the slaves of property, and I admit that it's a
question of degree, but what I call a 'Forsyte' is a man who is
decidedly more than less a slave of property. He knows a good
thing, he knows a safe thing, and his grip on property&mdash;it
doesn't matter whether it be wives, houses, money, or
reputation&mdash;is his hall-mark."</p>

<p>"Ah!" murmured Bosinney. "You should patent the word."</p>

<p>"I should like," said young Jolyon, "to lecture on it:</p>

<p>"Properties and quality of a Forsyte: This little animal,
disturbed by the ridicule of his own sort, is unaffected in his
motions by the laughter of strange creatures (you or I).
Hereditarily disposed to myopia, he recognises only the persons of
his own species, amongst which he passes an existence of
competitive tranquillity."</p>

<p>"You talk of them," said Bosinney, "as if they were half
England."</p>

<p>"They are," repeated young Jolyon, "half England, and the better
half, too, the safe half, the three per cent. half, the half that
counts. It's their wealth and security that makes everything
possible; makes your art possible, makes literature, science, even
religion, possible. Without Forsytes, who believe in none of these
things, and habitats but turn them all to use, where should we be?
My dear sir, the Forsytes are the middlemen, the commercials, the
pillars of society, the cornerstones of convention; everything that
is admirable!"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I catch your drift," said Bosinney, "but I
fancy there are plenty of Forsytes, as you call them, in my
profession."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied young Jolyon. "The great majority of
architects, painters, or writers have no principles, like any other
Forsytes. Art, literature, religion, survive by virtue of the few
cranks who really believe in such things, and the many Forsytes who
make a commercial use of them. At a low estimate, three-fourths of
our Royal Academicians are Forsytes, seven-eighths of our
novelists, a large proportion of the press. Of science I can't
speak; they are magnificently represented in religion; in the House
of Commons perhaps more numerous than anywhere; the aristocracy
speaks for itself. But I'm not laughing. It is dangerous to go
against the majority and what a majority!" He fixed his eyes on
Bosinney: "It's dangerous to let anything carry you away&mdash;a
house, a picture, a&mdash;woman!"</p>

<p>They looked at each other.&mdash;And, as though he had done that
which no Forsyte did&mdash;given himself away, young Jolyon drew
into his shell. Bosinney broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Why do you take your own people as the type?" said he.</p>

<p>"My people," replied young Jolyon, "are not very extreme, and
they have their own private peculiarities, like every other family,
but they possess in a remarkable degree those two qualities which
are the real tests of a Forsyte&mdash;the power of never being able
to give yourself up to anything soul and body, and the 'sense of
property'."</p>

<p>Bosinney smiled: "How about the big one, for instance?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean Swithin?" asked young Jolyon. "Ah! in Swithin
there's something primeval still. The town and middle-class life
haven't digested him yet. All the old centuries of farm work and
brute force have settled in him, and there they've stuck, for all
he's so distinguished."</p>

<p>Bosinney seemed to ponder. "Well, you've hit your cousin Soames
off to the life," he said suddenly. "He'll never blow his brains
out."</p>

<p>Young Jolyon shot at him a penetrating glance.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "he won't. That's why he's to be reckoned with.
Look out for their grip! It's easy to laugh, but don't mistake me.
It doesn't do to despise a Forsyte; it doesn't do to disregard
them!"</p>

<p>"Yet you've done it yourself!"</p>

<p>Young Jolyon acknowledged the hit by losing his smile.</p>

<p>"You forget," he said with a queer pride, "I can hold on,
too&mdash;I'm a Forsyte myself. We're all in the path of great
forces. The man who leaves the shelter of the
wall&mdash;well&mdash;you know what I mean. I don't," he ended very
low, as though uttering a threat, "recommend every man
to-go-my-way. It depends."</p>

<p>The colour rushed into Bosinney's face, but soon receded,
leaving it sallow-brown as before. He gave a short laugh, that left
his lips fixed in a queer, fierce smile; his eyes mocked young
Jolyon.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said. "It's deuced kind of you. But you're not the
only chaps that can hold on." He rose.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon looked after him as he walked away, and, resting
his head on his hand, sighed.</p>

<p>In the drowsy, almost empty room the only sounds were the rustle
of newspapers, the scraping of matches being struck. He stayed a
long time without moving, living over again those days when he,
too, had sat long hours watching the clock, waiting for the minutes
to pass&mdash;long hours full of the torments of uncertainty, and
of a fierce, sweet aching; and the slow, delicious agony of that
season came back to him with its old poignancy. The sight of
Bosinney, with his haggard face, and his restless eyes always
wandering to the clock, had roused in him a pity, with which was
mingled strange, irresistible envy.</p>

<p>He knew the signs so well. Whither was he going&mdash;to what
sort of fate? What kind of woman was it who was drawing him to her
by that magnetic force which no consideration of honour, no
principle, no interest could withstand; from which the only escape
was flight.</p>

<p>Flight! But why should Bosinney fly? A man fled when he was in
danger of destroying hearth and home, when there were children,
when he felt himself trampling down ideals, breaking something. But
here, so he had heard, it was all broken to his hand.</p>

<p>He himself had not fled, nor would he fly if it were all to come
over again. Yet he had gone further than Bosinney, had broken up
his own unhappy home, not someone else's: And the old saying came
back to him: 'A man's fate lies in his own heart.'</p>

<p>In his own heart! The proof of the pudding was in the
eating&mdash;Bosinney had still to eat his pudding.</p>

<p>His thoughts passed to the woman, the woman whom he did not
know, but the outline of whose story he had heard.</p>

<p>An unhappy marriage! No ill-treatment&mdash;only that
indefinable malaise, that terrible blight which killed all
sweetness under Heaven; and so from day to day, from night to
night, from week to week, from year to year, till death should end
it.</p>

<p>But young Jolyon, the bitterness of whose own feelings time had
assuaged, saw Soames' side of the question too. Whence should a man
like his cousin, saturated with all the prejudices and beliefs of
his class, draw the insight or inspiration necessary to break up
this life? It was a question of imagination, of projecting himself
into the future beyond the unpleasant gossip, sneers, and tattle
that followed on such separations, beyond the passing pangs that
the lack of the sight of her would cause, beyond the grave
disapproval of the worthy. But few men, and especially few men of
Soames' class, had imagination enough for that. A deal of mortals
in this world, and not enough imagination to go round! And sweet
Heaven, what a difference between theory and practice; many a man,
perhaps even Soames, held chivalrous views on such matters, who
when the shoe pinched found a distinguishing factor that made of
himself an exception.</p>

<p>Then, too, he distrusted his judgment. He had been through the
experience himself, had tasted too the dregs the bitterness of an
unhappy marriage, and how could he take the wide and dispassionate
view of those who had never been within sound of the battle? His
evidence was too first-hand&mdash;like the evidence on military
matters of a soldier who has been through much active service,
against that of civilians who have not suffered the disadvantage of
seeing things too close. Most people would consider such a marriage
as that of Soames and Irene quite fairly successful; he had money,
she had beauty; it was a case for compromise. There was no reason
why they should not jog along, even if they hated each other. It
would not matter if they went their own ways a little so long as
the decencies were observed&mdash;the sanctity of the marriage tie,
of the common home, respected. Half the marriages of the upper
classes were conducted on these lines: Do not offend the
susceptibilities of Society; do not offend the susceptibilities of
the Church. To avoid offending these is worth the sacrifice of any
private feelings. The advantages of the stable home are visible,
tangible, so many pieces of property; there is no risk in the statu
quo. To break up a home is at the best a dangerous experiment, and
selfish into the bargain.</p>

<p>This was the case for the defence, and young Jolyon sighed.</p>

<p>'The core of it all,' he thought, 'is property, but there are
many people who would not like it put that way. To them it is "the
sanctity of the marriage tie"; but the sanctity of the marriage tie
is dependent on the sanctity of the family, and the sanctity of the
family is dependent on the sanctity of property. And yet I imagine
all these people are followers of One who never owned anything. It
is curious!</p>

<p>And again young Jolyon sighed.</p>

<p>'Am I going on my way home to ask any poor devils I meet to
share my dinner, which will then be too little for myself, or, at
all events, for my wife, who is necessary to my health and
happiness? It may be that after all Soames does well to exercise
his rights and support by his practice the sacred principle of
property which benefits us all, with the exception of those who
suffer by the process.'</p>

<p>And so he left his chair, threaded his way through the maze of
seats, took his hat, and languidly up the hot streets crowded with
carriages, reeking with dusty odours, wended his way home.</p>

<p>Before reaching Wistaria Avenue he removed old Jolyon's letter
from his pocket, and tearing it carefully into tiny pieces,
scattered them in the dust of the road.</p>

<p>He let himself in with his key, and called his wife's name. But
she had gone out, taking Jolly and Holly, and the house was empty;
alone in the garden the dog Balthasar lay in the shade snapping at
flies.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon took his seat there, too, under the pear-tree that
bore no fruit.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER XI&mdash;BOSINNEY ON PAROLE</h3>

<p>The day after the evening at Richmond Soames returned from
Henley by a morning train. Not constitutionally interested in
amphibious sports, his visit had been one of business rather than
pleasure, a client of some importance having asked him down.</p>

<p>He went straight to the City, but finding things slack, he left
at three o'clock, glad of this chance to get home quietly. Irene
did not expect him. Not that he had any desire to spy on her
actions, but there was no harm in thus unexpectedly surveying the
scene.</p>

<p>After changing to Park clothes he went into the drawing-room.
She was sitting idly in the corner of the sofa, her favourite seat;
and there were circles under her eyes, as though she had not
slept.</p>

<p>He asked: "How is it you're in? Are you expecting somebody?"</p>

<p>"Yes that is, not particularly."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Bosinney said he might come."</p>

<p>"Bosinney. He ought to be at work."</p>

<p>To this she made no answer.</p>

<p>"Well," said Soames, "I want you to come out to the Stores with
me, and after that we'll go to the Park."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go out; I have a headache."</p>

<p>Soames replied: "If ever I want you to do anything, you've
always got a headache. It'll do you good to come and sit under the
trees."</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>Soames was silent for some minutes; at last he said: "I don't
know what your idea of a wife's duty is. I never have known!"</p>

<p>He had not expected her to reply, but she did.</p>

<p>"I have tried to do what you want; it's not my fault that I
haven't been able to put my heart into it."</p>

<p>"Whose fault is it, then?" He watched her askance.</p>

<p>"Before we were married you promised to let me go if our
marriage was not a success. Is it a success?"</p>

<p>Soames frowned.</p>

<p>"Success," he stammered&mdash;"it would be a success if you
behaved yourself properly!"</p>

<p>"I have tried," said Irene. "Will you let me go?"</p>

<p>Soames turned away. Secretly alarmed, he took refuge in
bluster.</p>

<p>"Let you go? You don't know what you're talking about. Let you
go? How can I let you go? We're married, aren't we? Then, what are
you talking about? For God's sake, don't let's have any of this
sort of nonsense! Get your hat on, and come and sit in the
Park."</p>

<p>"Then, you won't let me go?"</p>

<p>He felt her eyes resting on him with a strange, touching
look.</p>

<p>"Let you go!" he said; "and what on earth would you do with
yourself if I did? You've got no money!"</p>

<p>"I could manage somehow."</p>

<p>He took a swift turn up and down the room; then came and stood
before her.</p>

<p>"Understand," he said, "once and for all, I won't have you say
this sort of thing. Go and get your hat on!"</p>

<p>She did not move.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Soames, "you don't want to miss Bosinney if he
comes!"</p>

<p>Irene got up slowly and left the room. She came down with her
hat on.</p>

<p>They went out.</p>

<p>In the Park, the motley hour of mid-afternoon, when foreigners
and other pathetic folk drive, thinking themselves to be in
fashion, had passed; the right, the proper, hour had come, was
nearly gone, before Soames and Irene seated themselves under the
Achilles statue.</p>

<p>It was some time since he had enjoyed her company in the Park.
That was one of the past delights of the first two seasons of his
married life, when to feel himself the possessor of this gracious
creature before all London had been his greatest, though secret,
pride. How many afternoons had he not sat beside her, extremely
neat, with light grey gloves and faint, supercilious smile, nodding
to acquaintances, and now and again removing his hat.</p>

<p>His light grey gloves were still on his hands, and on his lips
his smile sardonic, but where the feeling in his heart?</p>

<p>The seats were emptying fast, but still he kept her there,
silent and pale, as though to work out a secret punishment. Once or
twice he made some comment, and she bent her head, or answered
"Yes" with a tired smile.</p>

<p>Along the rails a man was walking so fast that people stared
after him when he passed.</p>

<p>"Look at that ass!" said Soames; "he must be mad to walk like
that in this heat!"</p>

<p>He turned; Irene had made a rapid movement.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he said: "it's our friend the Buccaneer!"</p>

<p>And he sat still, with his sneering smile, conscious that Irene
was sitting still, and smiling too.</p>

<p>"Will she bow to him?" he thought.</p>

<p>But she made no sign.</p>

<p>Bosinney reached the end of the rails, and came walking back
amongst the chairs, quartering his ground like a pointer. When he
saw them he stopped dead, and raised his hat.</p>

<p>The smile never left Soames' face; he also took off his hat.</p>

<p>Bosinney came up, looking exhausted, like a man after hard
physical exercise; the sweat stood in drops on his brow, and
Soames' smile seemed to say: "You've had a trying time, my
friend...What are you doing in the Park?" he asked. "We thought you
despised such frivolity!"</p>

<p>Bosinney did not seem to hear; he made his answer to Irene:
"I've been round to your place; I hoped I should find you in."</p>

<p>Somebody tapped Soames on the back, and spoke to him; and in the
exchange of those platitudes over his shoulder, he missed her
answer, and took a resolution.</p>

<p>"We're just going in," he said to Bosinney; "you'd better come
back to dinner with us." Into that invitation he put a strange
bravado, a stranger pathos: "You, can't deceive me," his look and
voice seemed saying, "but see&mdash;I trust you&mdash;I'm not
afraid of you!"</p>

<p>They started back to Montpellier Square together, Irene between
them. In the crowded streets Soames went on in front. He did not
listen to their conversation; the strange resolution of
trustfulness he had taken seemed to animate even his secret
conduct. Like a gambler, he said to himself: 'It's a card I dare
not throw away&mdash;I must play it for what it's worth. I have not
too many chances.'</p>

<p>He dressed slowly, heard her leave her room and go downstairs,
and, for full five minutes after, dawdled about in his
dressing-room. Then he went down, purposely shutting the door
loudly to show that he was coming. He found them standing by the
hearth, perhaps talking, perhaps not; he could not say.</p>

<p>He played his part out in the farce, the long evening
through&mdash;his manner to his guest more friendly than it had
ever been before; and when at last Bosinney went, he said: "You
must come again soon; Irene likes to have you to talk about the
house!" Again his voice had the strange bravado and the stranger
pathos; but his hand was cold as ice.</p>

<p>Loyal to his resolution, he turned away from their parting,
turned away from his wife as she stood under the hanging lamp to
say good-night&mdash;away from the sight of her golden head shining
so under the light, of her smiling mournful lips; away from the
sight of Bosinney's eyes looking at her, so like a dog's looking at
its master.</p>

<p>And he went to bed with the certainty that Bosinney was in love
with his wife.</p>

<p>The summer night was hot, so hot and still that through every
opened window came in but hotter air. For long hours he lay
listening to her breathing.</p>

<p>She could sleep, but he must lie awake. And, lying awake, he
hardened himself to play the part of the serene and trusting
husband.</p>

<p>In the small hours he slipped out of bed, and passing into his
dressing-room, leaned by the open window.</p>

<p>He could hardly breathe.</p>

<p>A night four years ago came back to him&mdash;the night but one
before his marriage; as hot and stifling as this.</p>

<p>He remembered how he had lain in a long cane chair in the window
of his sitting-room off Victoria Street. Down below in a side
street a man had banged at a door, a woman had cried out; he
remembered, as though it were now, the sound of the scuffle, the
slam of the door, the dead silence that followed. And then the
early water-cart, cleansing the reek of the streets, had approached
through the strange-seeming, useless lamp-light; he seemed to hear
again its rumble, nearer and nearer, till it passed and slowly died
away.</p>

<p>He leaned far out of the dressing-room window over the little
court below, and saw the first light spread. The outlines of dark
walls and roofs were blurred for a moment, then came out sharper
than before.</p>

<p>He remembered how that other night he had watched the lamps
paling all the length of Victoria Street; how he had hurried on his
clothes and gone down into the street, down past houses and
squares, to the street where she was staying, and there had stood
and looked at the front of the little house, as still and grey as
the face of a dead man.</p>

<p>And suddenly it shot through his mind; like a sick man's fancy:
What's he doing?&mdash;that fellow who haunts me, who was here this
evening, who's in love with my wife&mdash;prowling out there,
perhaps, looking for her as I know he was looking for her this
afternoon; watching my house now, for all I can tell!</p>

<p>He stole across the landing to the front of the house,
stealthily drew aside a blind, and raised a window.</p>

<p>The grey light clung about the trees of the square, as though
Night, like a great downy moth, had brushed them with her wings.
The lamps were still alight, all pale, but not a soul
stirred&mdash;no living thing in sight.</p>

<p>Yet suddenly, very faint, far off in the deathly stillness, he
heard a cry writhing, like the voice of some wandering soul barred
out of heaven, and crying for its happiness. There it was
again&mdash;again! Soames shut the window, shuddering.</p>

<p>Then he thought: 'Ah! it's only the peacocks, across the
water.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII&mdash;JUNE PAYS SOME CALLS</h3>

<p>Jolyon stood in the narrow hall at Broadstairs, inhaling that
odour of oilcloth and herrings which permeates all respectable
seaside lodging-houses. On a chair&mdash;a shiny leather chair,
displaying its horsehair through a hole in the top left-hand
corner&mdash;stood a black despatch case. This he was filling with
papers, with the Times, and a bottle of Eau-de Cologne. He had
meetings that day of the 'Globular Gold Concessions' and the 'New
Colliery Company, Limited,' to which he was going up, for he never
missed a Board; to 'miss a Board' would be one more piece of
evidence that he was growing old, and this his jealous Forsyte
spirit could not bear.</p>

<p>His eyes, as he filled that black despatch case, looked as if at
any moment they might blaze up with anger. So gleams the eye of a
schoolboy, baited by a ring of his companions; but he controls
himself, deterred by the fearful odds against him. And old Jolyon
controlled himself, keeping down, with his masterful restraint now
slowly wearing out, the irritation fostered in him by the
conditions of his life.</p>

<p>He had received from his son an unpractical letter, in which by
rambling generalities the boy seemed trying to get out of answering
a plain question. 'I've seen Bosinney,' he said; 'he is not a
criminal. The more I see of people the more I am convinced that
they are never good or bad&mdash;merely comic, or pathetic. You
probably don't agree with me!'</p>

<p>Old Jolyon did not; he considered it cynical to so express
oneself; he had not yet reached that point of old age when even
Forsytes, bereft of those illusions and principles which they have
cherished carefully for practical purposes but never believed in,
bereft of all corporeal enjoyment, stricken to the very heart by
having nothing left to hope for&mdash;break through the barriers of
reserve and say things they would never have believed themselves
capable of saying.</p>

<p>Perhaps he did not believe in 'goodness' and 'badness' any more
than his son; but as he would have said: He didn't
know&mdash;couldn't tell; there might be something in it; and why,
by an unnecessary expression of disbelief, deprive yourself of
possible advantage?</p>

<p>Accustomed to spend his holidays among the mountains, though
(like a true Forsyte) he had never attempted anything too
adventurous or too foolhardy, he had been passionately fond of
them. And when the wonderful view (mentioned in
Baedeker&mdash;'fatiguing but repaying')&mdash;was disclosed to him
after the effort of the climb, he had doubtless felt the existence
of some great, dignified principle crowning the chaotic strivings,
the petty precipices, and ironic little dark chasms of life. This
was as near to religion, perhaps, as his practical spirit had ever
gone.</p>

<p>But it was many years since he had been to the mountains. He had
taken June there two seasons running, after his wife died, and had
realized bitterly that his walking days were over.</p>

<p>To that old mountain&mdash;given confidence in a supreme order
of things he had long been a stranger.</p>

<p>He knew himself to be old, yet he felt young; and this troubled
him. It troubled and puzzled him, too, to think that he, who had
always been so careful, should be father and grandfather to such as
seemed born to disaster. He had nothing to say against Jo&mdash;who
could say anything against the boy, an amiable chap?&mdash;but his
position was deplorable, and this business of June's nearly as bad.
It seemed like a fatality, and a fatality was one of those things
no man of his character could either understand or put up with.</p>

<p>In writing to his son he did not really hope that anything would
come of it. Since the ball at Roger's he had seen too clearly how
the land lay&mdash;he could put two and two together quicker than
most men&mdash;and, with the example of his own son before his
eyes, knew better than any Forsyte of them all that the pale flame
singes men's wings whether they will or no.</p>

<p>In the days before June's engagement, when she and Mrs. Soames
were always together, he had seen enough of Irene to feel the spell
she cast over men. She was not a flirt, not even a
coquette&mdash;words dear to the heart of his generation, which
loved to define things by a good, broad, inadequate word&mdash;but
she was dangerous. He could not say why. Tell him of a quality
innate in some women&mdash;a seductive power beyond their own
control! He would but answer: 'Humbug!' She was dangerous, and
there was an end of it. He wanted to close his eyes to that affair.
If it was, it was; he did not want to hear any more about
it&mdash;he only wanted to save June's position and her peace of
mind. He still hoped she might once more become a comfort to
himself.</p>

<p>And so he had written. He got little enough out of the answer.
As to what young Jolyon had made of the interview, there was
practically only the queer sentence: 'I gather that he's in the
stream.' The stream! What stream? What was this new-fangled way of
talking?</p>

<p>He sighed, and folded the last of the papers under the flap of
the bag; he knew well enough what was meant.</p>

<p>June came out of the dining-room, and helped him on with his
summer coat. From her costume, and the expression of her little
resolute face, he saw at once what was coming.</p>

<p>"I'm going with you," she said.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my dear; I go straight into the City. I can't have
you racketting about!"</p>

<p>"I must see old Mrs. Smeech."</p>

<p>"Oh, your precious 'lame ducks!" grumbled out old Jolyon. He did
not believe her excuse, but ceased his opposition. There was no
doing anything with that pertinacity of hers.</p>

<p>At Victoria he put her into the carriage which had been ordered
for himself&mdash;a characteristic action, for he had no petty
selfishnesses.</p>

<p>"Now, don't you go tiring yourself, my darling," he said, and
took a cab on into the city.</p>

<p>June went first to a back-street in Paddington, where Mrs.
Smeech, her 'lame duck,' lived&mdash;an aged person, connected with
the charring interest; but after half an hour spent in hearing her
habitually lamentable recital, and dragooning her into temporary
comfort, she went on to Stanhope Gate. The great house was closed
and dark.</p>

<p>She had decided to learn something at all costs. It was better
to face the worst, and have it over. And this was her plan: To go
first to Phil's aunt, Mrs. Baynes, and, failing information there,
to Irene herself. She had no clear notion of what she would gain by
these visits.</p>

<p>At three o'clock she was in Lowndes Square. With a woman's
instinct when trouble is to be faced, she had put on her best
frock, and went to the battle with a glance as courageous as old
Jolyon's itself. Her tremors had passed into eagerness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baynes, Bosinney's aunt (Louisa was her name), was in her
kitchen when June was announced, organizing the cook, for she was
an excellent housewife, and, as Baynes always said, there was 'a
lot in a good dinner.' He did his best work after dinner. It was
Baynes who built that remarkably fine row of tall crimson houses in
Kensington which compete with so many others for the title of 'the
ugliest in London.'</p>

<p>On hearing June's name, she went hurriedly to her bedroom, and,
taking two large bracelets from a red morocco case in a locked
drawer, put them on her white wrists&mdash;for she possessed in a
remarkable degree that 'sense of property,' which, as we know, is
the touchstone of Forsyteism, and the foundation of good
morality.</p>

<p>Her figure, of medium height and broad build, with a tendency to
embonpoint, was reflected by the mirror of her whitewood wardrobe,
in a gown made under her own organization, of one of those
half-tints, reminiscent of the distempered walls of corridors in
large hotels. She raised her hands to her hair, which she wore a la
Princesse de Galles, and touched it here and there, settling it
more firmly on her head, and her eyes were full of an unconscious
realism, as though she were looking in the face one of life's
sordid facts, and making the best of it. In youth her cheeks had
been of cream and roses, but they were mottled now by middle-age,
and again that hard, ugly directness came into her eyes as she
dabbed a powder-puff across her forehead. Putting the puff down,
she stood quite still before the glass, arranging a smile over her
high, important nose, her, chin, (never large, and now growing
smaller with the increase of her neck), her thin-lipped,
down-drooping mouth. Quickly, not to lose the effect, she grasped
her skirts strongly in both hands, and went downstairs.</p>

<p>She had been hoping for this visit for some time past. Whispers
had reached her that things were not all right between her nephew
and his fiancee. Neither of them had been near her for weeks. She
had asked Phil to dinner many times; his invariable answer had been
'Too busy.'</p>

<p>Her instinct was alarmed, and the instinct in such matters of
this excellent woman was keen. She ought to have been a Forsyte; in
young Jolyon's sense of the word, she certainly had that privilege,
and merits description as such.</p>

<p>She had married off her three daughters in a way that people
said was beyond their deserts, for they had the professional
plainness only to be found, as a rule, among the female kind of the
more legal callings. Her name was upon the committees of numberless
charities connected with the Church-dances, theatricals, or
bazaars&mdash;and she never lent her name unless sure beforehand
that everything had been thoroughly organized.</p>

<p>She believed, as she often said, in putting things on a
commercial basis; the proper function of the Church, of charity,
indeed, of everything, was to strengthen the fabric of 'Society.'
Individual action, therefore, she considered immoral. Organization
was the only thing, for by organization alone could you feel sure
that you were getting a return for your money.
Organization&mdash;and again, organization! And there is no doubt
that she was what old Jolyon called her&mdash;"a 'dab' at
that"&mdash;he went further, he called her "a humbug."</p>

<p>The enterprises to which she lent her name were organized so
admirably that by the time the takings were handed over, they were
indeed skim milk divested of all cream of human kindness. But as
she often justly remarked, sentiment was to be deprecated. She was,
in fact, a little academic.</p>

<p>This great and good woman, so highly thought of in
ecclesiastical circles, was one of the principal priestesses in the
temple of Forsyteism, keeping alive day and night a sacred flame to
the God of Property, whose altar is inscribed with those inspiring
words: 'Nothing for nothing, and really remarkably little for
sixpence.'</p>

<p>When she entered a room it was felt that something substantial
had come in, which was probably the reason of her popularity as a
patroness. People liked something substantial when they had paid
money for it; and they would look at her&mdash;surrounded by her
staff in charity ballrooms, with her high nose and her broad,
square figure, attired in an uniform covered with sequins&mdash;as
though she were a general.</p>

<p>The only thing against her was that she had not a double name.
She was a power in upper middle-class society, with its hundred
sets and circles, all intersecting on the common battlefield of
charity functions, and on that battlefield brushing skirts so
pleasantly with the skirts of Society with the capital 'S.' She was
a power in society with the smaller 's,' that larger, more
significant, and more powerful body, where the commercially
Christian institutions, maxims, and 'principle,' which Mrs. Baynes
embodied, were real life-blood, circulating freely, real business
currency, not merely the sterilized imitation that flowed in the
veins of smaller Society with the larger 'S.' People who knew her
felt her to be sound&mdash;a sound woman, who never gave herself
away, nor anything else, if she could possibly help it.</p>

<p>She had been on the worst sort of terms with Bosinney's father,
who had not infrequently made her the object of an unpardonable
ridicule. She alluded to him now that he was gone as her 'poor,
dear, irreverend brother.'</p>

<p>She greeted June with the careful effusion of which she was a
mistress, a little afraid of her as far as a woman of her eminence
in the commercial and Christian world could be afraid&mdash;for so
slight a girl June had a great dignity, the fearlessness of her
eyes gave her that. And Mrs. Baynes, too, shrewdly recognized that
behind the uncompromising frankness of June's manner there was much
of the Forsyte. If the girl had been merely frank and courageous,
Mrs. Baynes would have thought her 'cranky,' and despised her; if
she had been merely a Forsyte, like Francie&mdash;let us
say&mdash;she would have patronized her from sheer weight of metal;
but June, small though she was&mdash;Mrs. Baynes habitually admired
quantity&mdash;gave her an uneasy feeling; and she placed her in a
chair opposite the light.</p>

<p>There was another reason for her respect which Mrs. Baynes, too
good a churchwoman to be worldly, would have been the last to
admit&mdash;she often heard her husband describe old Jolyon as
extremely well off, and was biassed towards his granddaughter for
the soundest of all reasons. To-day she felt the emotion with which
we read a novel describing a hero and an inheritance, nervously
anxious lest, by some frightful lapse of the novelist, the young
man should be left without it at the end.</p>

<p>Her manner was warm; she had never seen so clearly before how
distinguished and desirable a girl this was. She asked after old
Jolyon's health. A wonderful man for his age; so upright, and young
looking, and how old was he? Eighty-one! She would never have
thought it! They were at the sea! Very nice for them; she supposed
June heard from Phil every day? Her light grey eyes became more
prominent as she asked this question; but the girl met the glance
without flinching.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "he never writes!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baynes's eyes dropped; they had no intention of doing so,
but they did. They recovered immediately.</p>

<p>"Of course not. That's Phil all over&mdash;he was always like
that!"</p>

<p>"Was he?" said June.</p>

<p>The brevity of the answer caused Mrs. Baynes's bright smile a
moment's hesitation; she disguised it by a quick movement, and
spreading her skirts afresh, said: "Why, my dear&mdash;he's quite
the most harum-scarum person; one never pays the slightest
attention to what he does!"</p>

<p>The conviction came suddenly to June that she was wasting her
time; even were she to put a question point-blank, she would never
get anything out of this woman.</p>

<p>'Do you see him?' she asked, her face crimsoning.</p>

<p>The perspiration broke out on Mrs. Baynes' forehead beneath the
powder.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I don't remember when he was here last&mdash;indeed,
we haven't seen much of him lately. He's so busy with your cousin's
house; I'm told it'll be finished directly. We must organize a
little dinner to celebrate the event; do come and stay the night
with us!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said June. Again she thought: 'I'm only wasting my
time. This woman will tell me nothing.'</p>

<p>She got up to go. A change came over Mrs. Baynes. She rose too;
her lips twitched, she fidgeted her hands. Something was evidently
very wrong, and she did not dare to ask this girl, who stood there,
a slim, straight little figure, with her decided face, her set jaw,
and resentful eyes. She was not accustomed to be afraid of asking
question's&mdash;all organization was based on the asking of
questions!</p>

<p>But the issue was so grave that her nerve, normally strong, was
fairly shaken; only that morning her husband had said: "Old Mr.
Forsyte must be worth well over a hundred thousand pounds!"</p>

<p>And this girl stood there, holding out her hand&mdash;holding
out her hand!</p>

<p>The chance might be slipping away&mdash;she couldn't
tell&mdash;the chance of keeping her in the family, and yet she
dared not speak.</p>

<p>Her eyes followed June to the door.</p>

<p>It closed.</p>

<p>Then with an exclamation Mrs. Baynes ran forward, wobbling her
bulky frame from side to side, and opened it again.</p>

<p>Too late! She heard the front door click, and stood still, an
expression of real anger and mortification on her face.</p>

<p>June went along the Square with her bird-like quickness. She
detested that woman now whom in happier days she had been
accustomed to think so kind. Was she always to be put off thus, and
forced to undergo this torturing suspense?</p>

<p>She would go to Phil himself, and ask him what he meant. She had
the right to know. She hurried on down Sloane Street till she came
to Bosinney's number. Passing the swing-door at the bottom, she ran
up the stairs, her heart thumping painfully.</p>

<p>At the top of the third flight she paused for breath, and
holding on to the bannisters, stood listening. No sound came from
above.</p>

<p>With a very white face she mounted the last flight. She saw the
door, with his name on the plate. And the resolution that had
brought her so far evaporated.</p>

<p>The full meaning of her conduct came to her. She felt hot all
over; the palms of her hands were moist beneath the thin silk
covering of her gloves.</p>

<p>She drew back to the stairs, but did not descend. Leaning
against the rail she tried to get rid of a feeling of being choked;
and she gazed at the door with a sort of dreadful courage. No! she
refused to go down. Did it matter what people thought of her? They
would never know! No one would help her if she did not help
herself! She would go through with it.</p>

<p>Forcing herself, therefore, to leave the support of the wall,
she rang the bell. The door did not open, and all her shame and
fear suddenly abandoned her; she rang again and again, as though in
spite of its emptiness she could drag some response out of that
closed room, some recompense for the shame and fear that visit had
cost her. It did not open; she left off ringing, and, sitting down
at the top of the stairs, buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Presently she stole down, out into the air. She felt as though
she had passed through a bad illness, and had no desire now but to
get home as quickly as she could. The people she met seemed to know
where she had been, what she had been doing; and
suddenly&mdash;over on the opposite side, going towards his rooms
from the direction of Montpellier Square&mdash;she saw Bosinney
himself.</p>

<p>She made a movement to cross into the traffic. Their eyes met,
and he raised his hat. An omnibus passed, obscuring her view; then,
from the edge of the pavement, through a gap in the traffic, she
saw him walking on.</p>

<p>And June stood motionless, looking after him.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;PERFECTION OF THE HOUSE</h3>

<p>'One mockturtle, clear; one oxtail; two glasses of port.'</p>

<p>In the upper room at French's, where a Forsyte could still get
heavy English food, James and his son were sitting down to
lunch.</p>

<p>Of all eating-places James liked best to come here; there was
something unpretentious, well-flavoured, and filling about it, and
though he had been to a certain extent corrupted by the necessity
for being fashionable, and the trend of habits keeping pace with an
income that would increase, he still hankered in quiet City moments
after the tasty fleshpots of his earlier days. Here you were served
by hairy English waiters in aprons; there was sawdust on the floor,
and three round gilt looking-glasses hung just above the line of
sight. They had only recently done away with the cubicles, too, in
which you could have your chop, prime chump, with a floury-potato,
without seeing your neighbours, like a gentleman.</p>

<p>He tucked the top corner of his napkin behind the third button
of his waistcoat, a practice he had been obliged to abandon years
ago in the West End. He felt that he should relish his
soup&mdash;the entire morning had been given to winding up the
estate of an old friend.</p>

<p>After filling his mouth with household bread, stale, he at once
began: "How are you going down to Robin Hill? You going to take
Irene? You'd better take her. I should think there'll be a lot
that'll want seeing to."</p>

<p>Without looking up, Soames answered: "She won't go."</p>

<p>"Won't go? What's the meaning of that? She's going to live in
the house, isn't she?"</p>

<p>Soames made no reply.</p>

<p>"I don't know what's coming to women nowadays," mumbled James;
"I never used to have any trouble with them. She's had too much
liberty. She's spoiled..."</p>

<p>Soames lifted his eyes: "I won't have anything said against
her," he said unexpectedly.</p>

<p>The silence was only broken now by the supping of James's
soup.</p>

<p>The waiter brought the two glasses of port, but Soames stopped
him.</p>

<p>"That's not the way to serve port," he said; "take them away,
and bring the bottle."</p>

<p>Rousing himself from his reverie over the soup, James took one
of his rapid shifting surveys of surrounding facts.</p>

<p>"Your mother's in bed," he said; "you can have the carriage to
take you down. I should think Irene'd like the drive. This young
Bosinney'll be there, I suppose, to show you over."</p>

<p>Soames nodded.</p>

<p>"I should like to go and see for myself what sort of a job he's
made finishing off," pursued James. "I'll just drive round and pick
you both up."</p>

<p>"I am going down by train," replied Soames. "If you like to
drive round and see, Irene might go with you, I can't tell."</p>

<p>He signed to the waiter to bring the bill, which James paid.</p>

<p>They parted at St. Paul's, Soames branching off to the station,
James taking his omnibus westwards.</p>

<p>He had secured the corner seat next the conductor, where his
long legs made it difficult for anyone to get in, and at all who
passed him he looked resentfully, as if they had no business to be
using up his air.</p>

<p>He intended to take an opportunity this afternoon of speaking to
Irene. A word in time saved nine; and now that she was going to
live in the country there was a chance for her to turn over a new
leaf! He could see that Soames wouldn't stand very much more of her
goings on!</p>

<p>It did not occur to him to define what he meant by her 'goings
on'; the expression was wide, vague, and suited to a Forsyte. And
James had more than his common share of courage after lunch.</p>

<p>On reaching home, he ordered out the barouche, with special
instructions that the groom was to go too. He wished to be kind to
her, and to give her every chance.</p>

<p>When the door of No.62 was opened he could distinctly hear her
singing, and said so at once, to prevent any chance of being denied
entrance.</p>

<p>Yes, Mrs. Soames was in, but the maid did not know if she was
seeing people.</p>

<p>James, moving with the rapidity that ever astonished the
observers of his long figure and absorbed expression, went
forthwith into the drawing-room without permitting this to be
ascertained. He found Irene seated at the piano with her hands
arrested on the keys, evidently listening to the voices in the
hall. She greeted him without smiling.</p>

<p>"Your mother-in-law's in bed," he began, hoping at once to
enlist her sympathy. "I've got the carriage here. Now, be a good
girl, and put on your hat and come with me for a drive. It'll do
you good!"</p>

<p>Irene looked at him as though about to refuse, but, seeming to
change her mind, went upstairs, and came down again with her hat
on.</p>

<p>"Where are you going to take me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We'll just go down to Robin Hill," said James, spluttering out
his words very quick; "the horses want exercise, and I should like
to see what they've been doing down there."</p>

<p>Irene hung back, but again changed her mind, and went out to the
carriage, James brooding over her closely, to make quite sure.</p>

<p>It was not before he had got her more than half way that he
began: "Soames is very fond of you&mdash;he won't have anything
said against you; why don't you show him more affection?"</p>

<p>Irene flushed, and said in a low voice: "I can't show what I
haven't got."</p>

<p>James looked at her sharply; he felt that now he had her in his
own carriage, with his own horses and servants, he was really in
command of the situation. She could not put him off; nor would she
make a scene in public.</p>

<p>"I can't think what you're about," he said. "He's a very good
husband!"</p>

<p>Irene's answer was so low as to be almost inaudible among the
sounds of traffic. He caught the words: "You are not married to
him!"</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with it? He's given you everything you
want. He's always ready to take you anywhere, and now he's built
you this house in the country. It's not as if you had anything of
your own."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Again James looked at her; he could not make out the expression
on her face. She looked almost as if she were going to cry, and
yet...</p>

<p>"I'm sure," he muttered hastily, "we've all tried to be kind to
you."</p>

<p>Irene's lips quivered; to his dismay James saw a tear steal down
her cheek. He felt a choke rise in his own throat.</p>

<p>"We're all fond of you," he said, "if you'd only"&mdash;he was
going to say, "behave yourself," but changed it to&mdash;"if you'd
only be more of a wife to him."</p>

<p>Irene did not answer, and James, too, ceased speaking. There was
something in her silence which disconcerted him; it was not the
silence of obstinacy, rather that of acquiescence in all that he
could find to say. And yet he felt as if he had not had the last
word. He could not understand this.</p>

<p>He was unable, however, to long keep silence.</p>

<p>"I suppose that young Bosinney," he said, "will be getting
married to June now?"</p>

<p>Irene's face changed. "I don't know," she said; "you should ask
her."</p>

<p>"Does she write to you?" No.</p>

<p>"How's that?" said James. "I thought you and she were such great
friends."</p>

<p>Irene turned on him. "Again," she said, "you should ask
her!"</p>

<p>"Well," flustered James, frightened by her look, "it's very odd
that I can't get a plain answer to a plain question, but there it
is."</p>

<p>He sat ruminating over his rebuff, and burst out at last:</p>

<p>"Well, I've warned you. You won't look ahead. Soames he doesn't
say much, but I can see he won't stand a great deal more of this
sort of thing. You'll have nobody but yourself to blame, and,
what's more, you'll get no sympathy from anybody."</p>

<p>Irene bent her head with a little smiling bow. "I am very much
obliged to you."</p>

<p>James did not know what on earth to answer.</p>

<p>The bright hot morning had changed slowly to a grey, oppressive
afternoon; a heavy bank of clouds, with the yellow tinge of coming
thunder, had risen in the south, and was creeping up.</p>

<p>The branches of the trees dropped motionless across the road
without the smallest stir of foliage. A faint odour of glue from
the heated horses clung in the thick air; the coachman and groom,
rigid and unbending, exchanged stealthy murmurs on the box, without
ever turning their heads.</p>

<p>To James' great relief they reached the house at last; the
silence and impenetrability of this woman by his side, whom he had
always thought so soft and mild, alarmed him.</p>

<p>The carriage put them down at the door, and they entered.</p>

<p>The hall was cool, and so still that it was like passing into a
tomb; a shudder ran down James's spine. He quickly lifted the heavy
leather curtains between the columns into the inner court.</p>

<p>He could not restrain an exclamation of approval.</p>

<p>The decoration was really in excellent taste. The dull ruby
tiles that extended from the foot of the walls to the verge of a
circular clump of tall iris plants, surrounding in turn a sunken
basin of white marble filled with water, were obviously of the best
quality. He admired extremely the purple leather curtains drawn
along one entire side, framing a huge white-tiled stove. The
central partitions of the skylight had been slid back, and the warm
air from outside penetrated into the very heart of the house.</p>

<p>He stood, his hands behind him, his head bent back on his high,
narrow shoulders, spying the tracery on the columns and the pattern
of the frieze which ran round the ivory-coloured walls under the
gallery. Evidently, no pains had been spared. It was quite the
house of a gentleman. He went up to the curtains, and, having
discovered how they were worked, drew them asunder and disclosed
the picture-gallery, ending in a great window taking up the whole
end of the room. It had a black oak floor, and its walls, again,
were of ivory white. He went on throwing open doors, and peeping
in. Everything was in apple-pie order, ready for immediate
occupation.</p>

<p>He turned round at last to speak to Irene, and saw her standing
over in the garden entrance, with her husband and Bosinney.</p>

<p>Though not remarkable for sensibility, James felt at once that
something was wrong. He went up to them, and, vaguely alarmed,
ignorant of the nature of the trouble, made an attempt to smooth
things over.</p>

<p>"How are you, Mr. Bosinney?" he said, holding out his hand.
"You've been spending money pretty freely down here, I should
say!"</p>

<p>Soames turned his back, and walked away.</p>

<p>James looked from Bosinney's frowning face to Irene, and, in his
agitation, spoke his thoughts aloud: "Well, I can't tell what's the
matter. Nobody tells me anything!" And, making off after his son,
he heard Bosinney's short laugh, and his "Well, thank God! You look
so..." Most unfortunately he lost the rest.</p>

<p>What had happened? He glanced back. Irene was very close to the
architect, and her face not like the face he knew of her. He
hastened up to his son.</p>

<p>Soames was pacing the picture-gallery.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" said James. "What's all this?"</p>

<p>Soames looked at him with his supercilious calm unbroken, but
James knew well enough that he was violently angry.</p>

<p>"Our friend," he said, "has exceeded his instructions again,
that's all. So much the worse for him this time."</p>

<p>He turned round and walked back towards the door. James followed
hurriedly, edging himself in front. He saw Irene take her finger
from before her lips, heard her say something in her ordinary
voice, and began to speak before he reached them.</p>

<p>"There's a storm coming on. We'd better get home. We can't take
you, I suppose, Mr. Bosinney? No, I suppose not. Then, good-bye!"
He held out his hand. Bosinney did not take it, but, turning with a
laugh, said:</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Mr. Forsyte. Don't get caught in the storm!" and
walked away.</p>

<p>"Well," began James, "I don't know..."</p>

<p>But the 'sight of Irene's face stopped him. Taking hold of his
daughter-in-law by the elbow, he escorted her towards the carriage.
He felt certain, quite certain, they had been making some
appointment or other...</p>

<p>Nothing in this world is more sure to upset a Forsyte than the
discovery that something on which he has stipulated to spend a
certain sum has cost more. And this is reasonable, for upon the
accuracy of his estimates the whole policy of his life is ordered.
If he cannot rely on definite values of property, his compass is
amiss; he is adrift upon bitter waters without a helm.</p>

<p>After writing to Bosinney in the terms that have already been
chronicled, Soames had dismissed the cost of the house from his
mind. He believed that he had made the matter of the final cost so
very plain that the possibility of its being again exceeded had
really never entered his head. On hearing from Bosinney that his
limit of twelve thousand pounds would be exceeded by something like
four hundred, he had grown white with anger. His original estimate
of the cost of the house completed had been ten thousand pounds,
and he had often blamed himself severely for allowing himself to be
led into repeated excesses. Over this last expenditure, however,
Bosinney had put himself completely in the wrong. How on earth a
fellow could make such an ass of himself Soames could not conceive;
but he had done so, and all the rancour and hidden jealousy that
had been burning against him for so long was now focussed in rage
at this crowning piece of extravagance. The attitude of the
confident and friendly husband was gone. To preserve
property&mdash;his wife&mdash;he had assumed it, to preserve
property of another kind he lost it now.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he had said to Bosinney when he could speak, "and I
suppose you're perfectly contented with yourself. But I may as well
tell you that you've altogether mistaken your man!"</p>

<p>What he meant by those words he did not quite know at the time,
but after dinner he looked up the correspondence between himself
and Bosinney to make quite sure. There could be no two opinions
about it&mdash;the fellow had made himself liable for that extra
four hundred, or, at all events, for three hundred and fifty of it,
and he would have to make it good.</p>

<p>He was looking at his wife's face when he came to this
conclusion. Seated in her usual seat on the sofa, she was altering
the lace on a collar. She had not once spoken to him all the
evening.</p>

<p>He went up to the mantelpiece, and contemplating his face in the
mirror said: "Your friend the Buccaneer has made a fool of himself;
he will have to pay for it!"</p>

<p>She looked at him scornfully, and answered: "I don't know what
you are talking about!"</p>

<p>"You soon will. A mere trifle, quite beneath your
contempt&mdash;four hundred pounds."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you are going to make him pay that towards
this hateful, house?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"And you know he's got nothing?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you are meaner than I thought you."</p>

<p>Soames turned from the mirror, and unconsciously taking a china
cup from the mantelpiece, clasped his hands around it as though
praying. He saw her bosom rise and fall, her eyes darkening with
anger, and taking no notice of the taunt, he asked quietly:</p>

<p>"Are you carrying on a flirtation with Bosinney?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not!"</p>

<p>Her eyes met his, and he looked away. He neither believed nor
disbelieved her, but he knew that he had made a mistake in asking;
he never had known, never would know, what she was thinking. The
sight of her inscrutable face, the thought of all the hundreds of
evenings he had seen her sitting there like that soft and passive,
but unreadable, unknown, enraged him beyond measure.</p>

<p>"I believe you are made of stone," he said, clenching his
fingers so hard that he broke the fragile cup. The pieces fell into
the grate. And Irene smiled.</p>

<p>"You seem to forget," she said, "that cup is not!"</p>

<p>Soames gripped her arm. "A good beating," he said, "is the only
thing that would bring you to your senses," but turning on his
heel, he left the room.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;SOAMES SITS ON THE STAIRS</h3>

<p>Soames went upstairs that night that he had gone too far. He was
prepared to offer excuses for his words.</p>

<p>He turned out the gas still burning in the passage outside their
room. Pausing, with his hand on the knob of the door, he tried to
shape his apology, for he had no intention of letting her see that
he was nervous.</p>

<p>But the door did not open, nor when he pulled it and turned the
handle firmly. She must have locked it for some reason, and
forgotten.</p>

<p>Entering his dressing-room where the gas was also light and
burning low, he went quickly to the other door. That too was
locked. Then he noticed that the camp bed which he occasionally
used was prepared, and his sleeping-suit laid out upon it. He put
his hand up to his forehead, and brought it away wet. It dawned on
him that he was barred out.</p>

<p>He went back to the door, and rattling the handle stealthily,
called: "Unlock the door, do you hear? Unlock the door!"</p>

<p>There was a faint rustling, but no answer.</p>

<p>"Do you hear? Let me in at once&mdash;I insist on being let
in!"</p>

<p>He could catch the sound of her breathing close to the door,
like the breathing of a creature threatened by danger.</p>

<p>There was something terrifying in this inexorable silence, in
the impossibility of getting at her. He went back to the other
door, and putting his whole weight against it, tried to burst it
open. The door was a new one&mdash;he had had them renewed himself,
in readiness for their coming in after the honeymoon. In a rage he
lifted his foot to kick in the panel; the thought of the servants
restrained him, and he felt suddenly that he was beaten.</p>

<p>Flinging himself down in the dressing-room, he took up a
book.</p>

<p>But instead of the print he seemed to see his wife&mdash;with
her yellow hair flowing over her bare shoulders, and her great dark
eyes&mdash;standing like an animal at bay. And the whole meaning of
her act of revolt came to him. She meant it to be for good.</p>

<p>He could not sit still, and went to the door again. He could
still hear her, and he called: "Irene! Irene!"</p>

<p>He did not mean to make his voice pathetic.</p>

<p>In ominous answer, the faint sounds ceased. He stood with
clenched hands, thinking.</p>

<p>Presently he stole round on tiptoe, and running suddenly at the
other door, made a supreme effort to break it open. It creaked, but
did not yield. He sat down on the stairs and buried his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>For a long time he sat there in the dark, the moon through the
skylight above laying a pale smear which lengthened slowly towards
him down the stairway. He tried to be philosophical.</p>

<p>Since she had locked her doors she had no further claim as a
wife, and he would console himself with other women.</p>

<p>It was but a spectral journey he made among such
delights&mdash;he had no appetite for these exploits. He had never
had much, and he had lost the habit. He felt that he could never
recover it. His hunger could only be appeased by his wife,
inexorable and frightened, behind these shut doors. No other woman
could help him.</p>

<p>This conviction came to him with terrible force out there in the
dark.</p>

<p>His philosophy left him; and surly anger took its place. Her
conduct was immoral, inexcusable, worthy of any punishment within
his power. He desired no one but her, and she refused him!</p>

<p>She must really hate him, then! He had never believed it yet. He
did not believe it now. It seemed to him incredible. He felt as
though he had lost for ever his power of judgment. If she, so soft
and yielding as he had always judged her, could take this decided
step&mdash;what could not happen?</p>

<p>Then he asked himself again if she were carrying on an intrigue
with Bosinney. He did not believe that she was; he could not afford
to believe such a reason for her conduct&mdash;the thought was not
to be faced.</p>

<p>It would be unbearable to contemplate the necessity of making
his marital relations public property. Short of the most convincing
proofs he must still refuse to believe, for he did not wish to
punish himself. And all the time at heart&mdash;he did believe.</p>

<p>The moonlight cast a greyish tinge over his figure, hunched
against the staircase wall.</p>

<p>Bosinney was in love with her! He hated the fellow, and would
not spare him now. He could and would refuse to pay a penny piece
over twelve thousand and fifty pounds&mdash;the extreme limit fixed
in the correspondence; or rather he would pay, he would pay and sue
him for damages. He would go to Jobling and Boulter and put the
matter in their hands. He would ruin the impecunious beggar! And
suddenly&mdash;though what connection between the
thoughts?&mdash;he reflected that Irene had no money either. They
were both beggars. This gave him a strange satisfaction.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by a faint creaking through the wall. She
was going to bed at last. Ah! Joy and pleasant dreams! If she threw
the door open wide he would not go in now!</p>

<p>But his lips, that were twisted in a bitter smile, twitched; he
covered his eyes with his hands...</p>

<p>It was late the following afternoon when Soames stood in the
dining-room window gazing gloomily into the Square.</p>

<p>The sunlight still showered on the plane-trees, and in the
breeze their gay broad leaves shone and swung in rhyme to a barrel
organ at the corner. It was playing a waltz, an old waltz that was
out of fashion, with a fateful rhythm in the notes; and it went on
and on, though nothing indeed but leaves danced to the tune.</p>

<p>The woman did not look too gay, for she was tired; and from the
tall houses no one threw her down coppers. She moved the organ on,
and three doors off began again.</p>

<p>It was the waltz they had played at Roger's when Irene had
danced with Bosinney; and the perfume of the gardenias she had worn
came back to Soames, drifted by the malicious music, as it had been
drifted to him then, when she passed, her hair glistening, her eyes
so soft, drawing Bosinney on and on down an endless ballroom.</p>

<p>The organ woman plied her handle slowly; she had been grinding
her tune all day-grinding it in Sloane Street hard by, grinding it
perhaps to Bosinney himself.</p>

<p>Soames turned, took a cigarette from the carven box, and walked
back to the window. The tune had mesmerized him, and there came
into his view Irene, her sunshade furled, hastening homewards down
the Square, in a soft, rose-coloured blouse with drooping sleeves,
that he did not know. She stopped before the organ, took out her
purse, and gave the woman money.</p>

<p>Soames shrank back and stood where he could see into the
hall.</p>

<p>She came in with her latch-key, put down her sunshade, and stood
looking at herself in the glass. Her cheeks were flushed as if the
sun had burned them; her lips were parted in a smile. She stretched
her arms out as though to embrace herself, with a laugh that for
all the world was like a sob.</p>

<p>Soames stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Very-pretty!" he said.</p>

<p>But as though shot she spun round, and would have passed him up
the stairs. He barred the way.</p>

<p>"Why such a hurry?" he said, and his eyes fastened on a curl of
hair fallen loose across her ear...</p>

<p>He hardly recognised her. She seemed on fire, so deep and rich
the colour of her cheeks, her eyes, her lips, and of the unusual
blouse she wore.</p>

<p>She put up her hand and smoothed back the curl. She was
breathing fast and deep, as though she had been running, and with
every breath perfume seemed to come from her hair, and from her
body, like perfume from an opening flower.</p>

<p>"I don't like that blouse," he said slowly, "it's a soft,
shapeless thing!"</p>

<p>He lifted his finger towards her breast, but she dashed his hand
aside.</p>

<p>"Don't touch me!" she cried.</p>

<p>He caught her wrist; she wrenched it away.</p>

<p>"And where may you have been?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In heaven&mdash;out of this house!" With those words she fled
upstairs.</p>

<p>Outside&mdash;in thanksgiving&mdash;at the very door, the
organ-grinder was playing the waltz.</p>

<p>And Soames stood motionless. What prevented him from following
her?</p>

<p>Was it that, with the eyes of faith, he saw Bosinney looking
down from that high window in Sloane Street, straining his eyes for
yet another glimpse of Irene's vanished figure, cooling his flushed
face, dreaming of the moment when she flung herself on his
breast&mdash;the scent of her still in the air around, and the
sound of her laugh that was like a sob?</p>

<h2>PART III</h2>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER I&mdash;MRS. MACANDER'S EVIDENCE</h3>

<p>Many people, no doubt, including the editor of the 'Ultra
Vivisectionist,' then in the bloom of its first youth, would say
that Soames was less than a man not to have removed the locks from
his wife's doors, and, after beating her soundly, resumed wedded
happiness.</p>

<p>Brutality is not so deplorably diluted by humaneness as it used
to be, yet a sentimental segment of the population may still be
relieved to learn that he did none of these things. For active
brutality is not popular with Forsytes; they are too circumspect,
and, on the whole, too softhearted. And in Soames there was some
common pride, not sufficient to make him do a really generous
action, but enough to prevent his indulging in an extremely mean
one, except, perhaps, in very hot blood. Above all this a true
Forsyte refused to feel himself ridiculous. Short of actually
beating his wife, he perceived nothing to be done; he therefore
accepted the situation without another word.</p>

<p>Throughout the summer and autumn he continued to go to the
office, to sort his pictures, and ask his friends to dinner.</p>

<p>He did not leave town; Irene refused to go away. The house at
Robin Hill, finished though it was, remained empty and ownerless.
Soames had brought a suit against the Buccaneer, in which he
claimed from him the sum of three hundred and fifty pounds.</p>

<p>A firm of solicitors, Messrs. Freak and Able, had put in a
defence on Bosinney's behalf. Admitting the facts, they raised a
point on the correspondence which, divested of legal phraseology,
amounted to this: To speak of 'a free hand in the terms of this
correspondence' is an Irish bull.</p>

<p>By a chance, fortuitous but not improbable in the close borough
of legal circles, a good deal of information came to Soames' ear
anent this line of policy, the working partner in his firm,
Bustard, happening to sit next at dinner at Walmisley's, the Taxing
Master, to young Chankery, of the Common Law Bar.</p>

<p>The necessity for talking what is known as 'shop,' which comes
on all lawyers with the removal of the ladies, caused Chankery, a
young and promising advocate, to propound an impersonal conundrum
to his neighbour, whose name he did not know, for, seated as he
permanently was in the background, Bustard had practically no
name.</p>

<p>He had, said Chankery, a case coming on with a 'very nice
point.' He then explained, preserving every professional
discretion, the riddle in Soames' case. Everyone, he said, to whom
he had spoken, thought it a nice point. The issue was small
unfortunately, 'though d&mdash;&mdash;d serious for his client he
believed'&mdash;Walmisley's champagne was bad but plentiful. A
Judge would make short work of it, he was afraid. He intended to
make a big effort&mdash;the point was a nice one. What did his
neighbour say?</p>

<p>Bustard, a model of secrecy, said nothing. He related the
incident to Soames however with some malice, for this quiet man was
capable of human feeling, ending with his own opinion that the
point was 'a very nice one.'</p>

<p>In accordance with his resolve, our Forsyte had put his
interests into the hands of Jobling and Boulter. From the moment of
doing so he regretted that he had not acted for himself. On
receiving a copy of Bosinney's defence he went over to their
offices.</p>

<p>Boulter, who had the matter in hand, Jobling having died some
years before, told him that in his opinion it was rather a nice
point; he would like counsel's opinion on it.</p>

<p>Soames told him to go to a good man, and they went to Waterbuck,
Q.C., marking him ten and one, who kept the papers six weeks and
then wrote as follows:</p>

<p>'In my opinion the true interpretation of this correspondence
depends very much on the intention of the parties, and will turn
upon the evidence given at the trial. I am of opinion that an
attempt should be made to secure from the architect an admission
that he understood he was not to spend at the outside more than
twelve thousand and fifty pounds. With regard to the expression, "a
free hand in the terms of this correspondence," to which my
attention is directed, the point is a nice one; but I am of opinion
that upon the whole the ruling in "Boileau v. The Blasted Cement
Co., Ltd.," will apply.'</p>

<p>Upon this opinion they acted, administering interrogatories, but
to their annoyance Messrs. Freak and Able answered these in so
masterly a fashion that nothing whatever was admitted and that
without prejudice.</p>

<p>It was on October 1 that Soames read Waterbuck's opinion, in the
dining-room before dinner.</p>

<p>It made him nervous; not so much because of the case of 'Boileau
v. The Blasted Cement Co., Ltd.,' as that the point had lately
begun to seem to him, too, a nice one; there was about it just that
pleasant flavour of subtlety so attractive to the best legal
appetites. To have his own impression confirmed by Waterbuck, Q.C.,
would have disturbed any man.</p>

<p>He sat thinking it over, and staring at the empty grate, for
though autumn had come, the weather kept as gloriously fine that
jubilee year as if it were still high August. It was not pleasant
to be disturbed; he desired too passionately to set his foot on
Bosinney's neck.</p>

<p>Though he had not seen the architect since the last afternoon at
Robin Hill, he was never free from the sense of his
presence&mdash;never free from the memory of his worn face with its
high cheek bones and enthusiastic eyes. It would not be too much to
say that he had never got rid of the feeling of that night when he
heard the peacock's cry at dawn&mdash;the feeling that Bosinney
haunted the house. And every man's shape that he saw in the dark
evenings walking past, seemed that of him whom George had so
appropriately named the Buccaneer.</p>

<p>Irene still met him, he was certain; where, or how, he neither
knew, nor asked; deterred by a vague and secret dread of too much
knowledge. It all seemed subterranean nowadays.</p>

<p>Sometimes when he questioned his wife as to where she had been,
which he still made a point of doing, as every Forsyte should, she
looked very strange. Her self-possession was wonderful, but there
were moments when, behind the mask of her face, inscrutable as it
had always been to him, lurked an expression he had never been used
to see there.</p>

<p>She had taken to lunching out too; when he asked Bilson if her
mistress had been in to lunch, as often as not she would answer:
"No, sir."</p>

<p>He strongly disapproved of her gadding about by herself, and
told her so. But she took no notice. There was something that
angered, amazed, yet almost amused him about the calm way in which
she disregarded his wishes. It was really as if she were hugging to
herself the thought of a triumph over him.</p>

<p>He rose from the perusal of Waterbuck, Q.C.'s opinion, and,
going upstairs, entered her room, for she did not lock her doors
till bed-time&mdash;she had the decency, he found, to save the
feelings of the servants. She was brushing her hair, and turned to
him with strange fierceness.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she said. "Please leave my room!"</p>

<p>He answered: "I want to know how long this state of things
between us is to last? I have put up with it long enough."</p>

<p>"Will you please leave my room?"</p>

<p>"Will you treat me as your husband?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then, I shall take steps to make you."</p>

<p>"Do!"</p>

<p>He stared, amazed at the calmness of her answer. Her lips were
compressed in a thin line; her hair lay in fluffy masses on her
bare shoulders, in all its strange golden contrast to her dark
eyes&mdash;those eyes alive with the emotions of fear, hate,
contempt, and odd, haunting triumph.</p>

<p>"Now, please, will you leave my room?" He turned round, and went
sulkily out.</p>

<p>He knew very well that he had no intention of taking steps, and
he saw that she knew too&mdash;knew that he was afraid to.</p>

<p>It was a habit with him to tell her the doings of his day: how
such and such clients had called; how he had arranged a mortgage
for Parkes; how that long-standing suit of Fryer v. Forsyte was
getting on, which, arising in the preternaturally careful
disposition of his property by his great uncle Nicholas, who had
tied it up so that no one could get at it at all, seemed likely to
remain a source of income for several solicitors till the Day of
Judgment.</p>

<p>And how he had called in at Jobson's, and seen a Boucher sold,
which he had just missed buying of Talleyrand and Sons in Pall
Mall.</p>

<p>He had an admiration for Boucher, Watteau, and all that school.
It was a habit with him to tell her all these matters, and he
continued to do it even now, talking for long spells at dinner, as
though by the volubility of words he could conceal from himself the
ache in his heart.</p>

<p>Often, if they were alone, he made an attempt to kiss her when
she said good-night. He may have had some vague notion that some
night she would let him; or perhaps only the feeling that a husband
ought to kiss his wife. Even if she hated him, he at all events
ought not to put himself in the wrong by neglecting this ancient
rite.</p>

<p>And why did she hate him? Even now he could not altogether
believe it. It was strange to be hated!&mdash;the emotion was too
extreme; yet he hated Bosinney, that Buccaneer, that prowling
vagabond, that night-wanderer. For in his thoughts Soames always
saw him lying in wait&mdash;wandering. Ah, but he must be in very
low water! Young Burkitt, the architect, had seen him coming out of
a third-rate restaurant, looking terribly down in the mouth!</p>

<p>During all the hours he lay awake, thinking over the situation,
which seemed to have no end&mdash;unless she should suddenly come
to her senses&mdash;never once did the thought of separating from
his wife seriously enter his head...</p>

<p>And the Forsytes! What part did they play in this stage of
Soames' subterranean tragedy?</p>

<p>Truth to say, little or none, for they were at the sea.</p>

<p>From hotels, hydropathics, or lodging-houses, they were bathing
daily; laying in a stock of ozone to last them through the
winter.</p>

<p>Each section, in the vineyard of its own choosing, grew and
culled and pressed and bottled the grapes of a pet sea-air.</p>

<p>The end of September began to witness their several returns.</p>

<p>In rude health and small omnibuses, with considerable colour in
their cheeks, they arrived daily from the various termini. The
following morning saw them back at their vocations.</p>

<p>On the next Sunday Timothy's was thronged from lunch till
dinner.</p>

<p>Amongst other gossip, too numerous and interesting to relate,
Mrs. Septimus Small mentioned that Soames and Irene had not been
away.</p>

<p>It remained for a comparative outsider to supply the next
evidence of interest.</p>

<p>It chanced that one afternoon late in September, Mrs. MacAnder,
Winifred Dartie's greatest friend, taking a constitutional, with
young Augustus Flippard, on her bicycle in Richmond Park, passed
Irene and Bosinney walking from the bracken towards the Sheen
Gate.</p>

<p>Perhaps the poor little woman was thirsty, for she had ridden
long on a hard, dry road, and, as all London knows, to ride a
bicycle and talk to young Flippard will try the toughest
constitution; or perhaps the sight of the cool bracken grove,
whence 'those two' were coming down, excited her envy. The cool
bracken grove on the top of the hill, with the oak boughs for roof,
where the pigeons were raising an endless wedding hymn, and the
autumn, humming, whispered to the ears of lovers in the fern, while
the deer stole by. The bracken grove of irretrievable delights, of
golden minutes in the long marriage of heaven and earth! The
bracken grove, sacred to stags, to strange tree-stump fauns leaping
around the silver whiteness of a birch-tree nymph at summer
dusk.</p>

<p>This lady knew all the Forsytes, and having been at June's 'at
home,' was not at a loss to see with whom she had to deal. Her own
marriage, poor thing, had not been successful, but having had the
good sense and ability to force her husband into pronounced error,
she herself had passed through the necessary divorce proceedings
without incurring censure.</p>

<p>She was therefore a judge of all that sort of thing, and lived
in one of those large buildings, where in small sets of apartments,
are gathered incredible quantities of Forsytes, whose chief
recreation out of business hours is the discussion of each other's
affairs.</p>

<p>Poor little woman, perhaps she was thirsty, certainly she was
bored, for Flippard was a wit. To see 'those two' in so unlikely a
spot was quite a merciful 'pick-me-up.'</p>

<p>At the MacAnder, like all London, Time pauses.</p>

<p>This small but remarkable woman merits attention; her all-seeing
eye and shrewd tongue were inscrutably the means of furthering the
ends of Providence.</p>

<p>With an air of being in at the death, she had an almost
distressing power of taking care of herself. She had done more,
perhaps, in her way than any woman about town to destroy the sense
of chivalry which still clogs the wheel of civilization. So smart
she was, and spoken of endearingly as 'the little MacAnder!'</p>

<p>Dressing tightly and well, she belonged to a Woman's Club, but
was by no means the neurotic and dismal type of member who was
always thinking of her rights. She took her rights unconsciously,
they came natural to her, and she knew exactly how to make the most
of them without exciting anything but admiration amongst that great
class to whom she was affiliated, not precisely perhaps by manner,
but by birth, breeding, and the true, the secret gauge, a sense of
property.</p>

<p>The daughter of a Bedfordshire solicitor, by the daughter of a
clergyman, she had never, through all the painful experience of
being married to a very mild painter with a cranky love of Nature,
who had deserted her for an actress, lost touch with the
requirements, beliefs, and inner feeling of Society; and, on
attaining her liberty, she placed herself without effort in the
very van of Forsyteism.</p>

<p>Always in good spirits, and 'full of information,' she was
universally welcomed. She excited neither surprise nor
disapprobation when encountered on the Rhine or at Zermatt, either
alone, or travelling with a lady and two gentlemen; it was felt
that she was perfectly capable of taking care of herself; and the
hearts of all Forsytes warmed to that wonderful instinct, which
enabled her to enjoy everything without giving anything away. It
was generally felt that to such women as Mrs. MacAnder should we
look for the perpetuation and increase of our best type of woman.
She had never had any children.</p>

<p>If there was one thing more than another that she could not
stand it was one of those soft women with what men called 'charm'
about them, and for Mrs. Soames she always had an especial
dislike.</p>

<p>Obscurely, no doubt, she felt that if charm were once admitted
as the criterion, smartness and capability must go to the wall; and
she hated&mdash;with a hatred the deeper that at times this
so-called charm seemed to disturb all calculations&mdash;the subtle
seductiveness which she could not altogether overlook in Irene.</p>

<p>She said, however, that she could see nothing in the
woman&mdash;there was no 'go' about her&mdash;she would never be
able to stand up for herself&mdash;anyone could take advantage of
her, that was plain&mdash;she could not see in fact what men found
to admire!</p>

<p>She was not really ill-natured, but, in maintaining her position
after the trying circumstances of her married life, she had found
it so necessary to be 'full of information,' that the idea of
holding her tongue about 'those two' in the Park never occurred to
her.</p>

<p>And it so happened that she was dining that very evening at
Timothy's, where she went sometimes to 'cheer the old things up,'
as she was wont to put it. The same people were always asked to
meet her: Winifred Dartie and her husband; Francie, because she
belonged to the artistic circles, for Mrs. MacAnder was known to
contribute articles on dress to 'The Ladies Kingdom Come'; and for
her to flirt with, provided they could be obtained, two of the
Hayman boys, who, though they never said anything, were believed to
be fast and thoroughly intimate with all that was latest in smart
Society.</p>

<p>At twenty-five minutes past seven she turned out the electric
light in her little hall, and wrapped in her opera cloak with the
chinchilla collar, came out into the corridor, pausing a moment to
make sure she had her latch-key. These little self-contained flats
were convenient; to be sure, she had no light and no air, but she
could shut it up whenever she liked and go away. There was no
bother with servants, and she never felt tied as she used to when
poor, dear Fred was always about, in his mooney way. She retained
no rancour against poor, dear Fred, he was such a fool; but the
thought of that actress drew from her, even now, a little, bitter,
derisive smile.</p>

<p>Firmly snapping the door to, she crossed the corridor, with its
gloomy, yellow-ochre walls, and its infinite vista of brown,
numbered doors. The lift was going down; and wrapped to the ears in
the high cloak, with every one of her auburn hairs in its place,
she waited motionless for it to stop at her floor. The iron gates
clanked open; she entered. There were already three occupants, a
man in a great white waistcoat, with a large, smooth face like a
baby's, and two old ladies in black, with mittened hands.</p>

<p>Mrs. MacAnder smiled at them; she knew everybody; and all these
three, who had been admirably silent before, began to talk at once.
This was Mrs. MacAnder's successful secret. She provoked
conversation.</p>

<p>Throughout a descent of five stories the conversation continued,
the lift boy standing with his back turned, his cynical face
protruding through the bars.</p>

<p>At the bottom they separated, the man in the white waistcoat
sentimentally to the billiard room, the old ladies to dine and say
to each other: "A dear little woman!" "Such a rattle!" and Mrs.
MacAnder to her cab.</p>

<p>When Mrs. MacAnder dined at Timothy's, the conversation
(although Timothy himself could never be induced to be present)
took that wider, man-of-the-world tone current among Forsytes at
large, and this, no doubt, was what put her at a premium there.</p>

<p>Mrs. Small and Aunt Hester found it an exhilarating change. "If
only," they said, "Timothy would meet her!" It was felt that she
would do him good. She could tell you, for instance, the latest
story of Sir Charles Fiste's son at Monte Carlo; who was the real
heroine of Tynemouth Eddy's fashionable novel that everyone was
holding up their hands over, and what they were doing in Paris
about wearing bloomers. She was so sensible, too, knowing all about
that vexed question, whether to send young Nicholas' eldest into
the navy as his mother wished, or make him an accountant as his
father thought would be safer. She strongly deprecated the navy. If
you were not exceptionally brilliant or exceptionally well
connected, they passed you over so disgracefully, and what was it
after all to look forward to, even if you became an admiral&mdash;a
pittance! An accountant had many more chances, but let him be put
with a good firm, where there was no risk at starting!</p>

<p>Sometimes she would give them a tip on the Stock Exchange; not
that Mrs. Small or Aunt Hester ever took it. They had indeed no
money to invest; but it seemed to bring them into such exciting
touch with the realities of life. It was an event. They would ask
Timothy, they said. But they never did, knowing in advance that it
would upset him. Surreptitiously, however, for weeks after they
would look in that paper, which they took with respect on account
of its really fashionable proclivities, to see whether 'Bright's
Rubies' or 'The Woollen Mackintosh Company' were up or down.
Sometimes they could not find the name of the company at all; and
they would wait until James or Roger or even Swithin came in, and
ask them in voices trembling with curiosity how that 'Bolivia Lime
and Speltrate' was doing&mdash;they could not find it in the
paper.</p>

<p>And Roger would answer: "What do you want to know for? Some
trash! You'll go burning your fingers&mdash;investing your money in
lime, and things you know nothing about! Who told you?" and
ascertaining what they had been told, he would go away, and, making
inquiries in the City, would perhaps invest some of his own money
in the concern.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of dinner, just in fact as the saddle of
mutton had been brought in by Smither, that Mrs. MacAnder, looking
airily round, said: "Oh! and whom do you think I passed to-day in
Richmond Park? You'll never guess&mdash;Mrs. Soames and&mdash;Mr.
Bosinney. They must have been down to look at the house!"</p>

<p>Winifred Dartie coughed, and no one said a word. It was the
piece of evidence they had all unconsciously been waiting for.</p>

<p>To do Mrs. MacAnder justice, she had been to Switzerland and the
Italian lakes with a party of three, and had not heard of Soames'
rupture with his architect. She could not tell, therefore, the
profound impression her words would make.</p>

<p>Upright and a little flushed, she moved her small, shrewd eyes
from face to face, trying to gauge the effect of her words. On
either side of her a Hayman boy, his lean, taciturn, hungry face
turned towards his plate, ate his mutton steadily.</p>

<p>These two, Giles and Jesse, were so alike and so inseparable
that they were known as the Dromios. They never talked, and seemed
always completely occupied in doing nothing. It was popularly
supposed that they were cramming for an important examination. They
walked without hats for long hours in the Gardens attached to their
house, books in their hands, a fox-terrier at their heels, never
saying a word, and smoking all the time. Every morning, about fifty
yards apart, they trotted down Campden Hill on two lean hacks, with
legs as long as their own, and every morning about an hour later,
still fifty yards apart, they cantered up again. Every evening,
wherever they had dined, they might be observed about half-past
ten, leaning over the balustrade of the Alhambra promenade.</p>

<p>They were never seen otherwise than together; in this way
passing their lives, apparently perfectly content.</p>

<p>Inspired by some dumb stirring within them of the feelings of
gentlemen, they turned at this painful moment to Mrs. MacAnder, and
said in precisely the same voice: "Have you seen the...?"</p>

<p>Such was her surprise at being thus addressed that she put down
her fork; and Smither, who was passing, promptly removed her plate.
Mrs. MacAnder, however, with presence of mind, said instantly: "I
must have a little more of that nice mutton."</p>

<p>But afterwards in the drawing&mdash;room she sat down by Mrs.
Small, determined to get to the bottom of the matter. And she
began:</p>

<p>"What a charming woman, Mrs. Soames; such a sympathetic
temperament! Soames is a really lucky man!"</p>

<p>Her anxiety for information had not made sufficient allowance
for that inner Forsyte skin which refuses to share its troubles
with outsiders.</p>

<p>Mrs. Septimus Small, drawing herself up with a creak and rustle
of her whole person, said, shivering in her dignity:</p>

<p>"My dear, it is a subject we do not talk about!"</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER II&mdash;NIGHT IN THE PARK</h3>

<p>Although with her infallible instinct Mrs. Small had said the
very thing to make her guest 'more intriguee than ever,' it is
difficult to see how else she could truthfully have spoken.</p>

<p>It was not a subject which the Forsytes could talk about even
among themselves&mdash;to use the word Soames had invented to
characterize to himself the situation, it was 'subterranean.'</p>

<p>Yet, within a week of Mrs. MacAnder's encounter in Richmond
Park, to all of them&mdash;save Timothy, from whom it was carefully
kept&mdash;to James on his domestic beat from the Poultry to Park
Lane, to George the wild one, on his daily adventure from the bow
window at the Haversnake to the billiard room at the 'Red Pottle,'
was it known that 'those two' had gone to extremes.</p>

<p>George (it was he who invented many of those striking
expressions still current in fashionable circles) voiced the
sentiment more accurately than any one when he said to his brother
Eustace that 'the Buccaneer' was 'going it'; he expected Soames was
about 'fed up.'</p>

<p>It was felt that he must be, and yet, what could be done? He
ought perhaps to take steps; but to take steps would be
deplorable.</p>

<p>Without an open scandal which they could not see their way to
recommending, it was difficult to see what steps could be taken. In
this impasse, the only thing was to say nothing to Soames, and
nothing to each other; in fact, to pass it over.</p>

<p>By displaying towards Irene a dignified coldness, some
impression might be made upon her; but she was seldom now to be
seen, and there seemed a slight difficulty in seeking her out on
purpose to show her coldness. Sometimes in the privacy of his
bedroom James would reveal to Emily the real suffering that his
son's misfortune caused him.</p>

<p>"I can't tell," he would say; "it worries me out of my life.
There'll be a scandal, and that'll do him no good. I shan't say
anything to him. There might be nothing in it. What do you think?
She's very artistic, they tell me. What? Oh, you're a 'regular
Juley! Well, I don't know; I expect the worst. This is what comes
of having no children. I knew how it would be from the first. They
never told me they didn't mean to have any children&mdash;nobody
tells me anything!"</p>

<p>On his knees by the side of the bed, his eyes open and fixed
with worry, he would breathe into the counterpane. Clad in his
nightshirt, his neck poked forward, his back rounded, he resembled
some long white bird.</p>

<p>"Our Father-," he repeated, turning over and over again the
thought of this possible scandal.</p>

<p>Like old Jolyon, he, too, at the bottom of his heart set the
blame of the tragedy down to family interference. What business had
that lot&mdash;he began to think of the Stanhope Gate branch,
including young Jolyon and his daughter, as 'that lot'&mdash;to
introduce a person like this Bosinney into the family? (He had
heard George's soubriquet, 'The Buccaneer,' but he could make
nothing of that&mdash;the young man was an architect.)</p>

<p>He began to feel that his brother Jolyon, to whom he had always
looked up and on whose opinion he had relied, was not quite what he
had expected.</p>

<p>Not having his eldest brother's force of character, he was more
sad than angry. His great comfort was to go to Winifred's, and take
the little Darties in his carriage over to Kensington Gardens, and
there, by the Round Pond, he could often be seen walking with his
eyes fixed anxiously on little Publius Dartie's sailing-boat, which
he had himself freighted with a penny, as though convinced that it
would never again come to shore; while little Publius&mdash;who,
James delighted to say, was not a bit like his father skipping
along under his lee, would try to get him to bet another that it
never would, having found that it always did. And James would make
the bet; he always paid&mdash;sometimes as many as three or four
pennies in the afternoon, for the game seemed never to pall on
little Publius&mdash;and always in paying he said: "Now, that's for
your money-box. Why, you're getting quite a rich man!" The thought
of his little grandson's growing wealth was a real pleasure to him.
But little Publius knew a sweet-shop, and a trick worth two of
that.</p>

<p>And they would walk home across the Park, James' figure, with
high shoulders and absorbed and worried face, exercising its tall,
lean protectorship, pathetically unregarded, over the robust
child-figures of Imogen and little Publius.</p>

<p>But those Gardens and that Park were not sacred to James.
Forsytes and tramps, children and lovers, rested and wandered day
after day, night after night, seeking one and all some freedom from
labour, from the reek and turmoil of the streets.</p>

<p>The leaves browned slowly, lingering with the sun and
summer-like warmth of the nights.</p>

<p>On Saturday, October 5, the sky that had been blue all day
deepened after sunset to the bloom of purple grapes. There was no
moon, and a clear dark, like some velvety garment, was wrapped
around the trees, whose thinned branches, resembling plumes,
stirred not in the still, warm air. All London had poured into the
Park, draining the cup of summer to its dregs.</p>

<p>Couple after couple, from every gate, they streamed along the
paths and over the burnt grass, and one after another, silently out
of the lighted spaces, stole into the shelter of the feathery
trees, where, blotted against some trunk, or under the shadow of
shrubs, they were lost to all but themselves in the heart of the
soft darkness.</p>

<p>To fresh-comers along the paths, these forerunners formed but
part of that passionate dusk, whence only a strange murmur, like
the confused beating of hearts, came forth. But when that murmur
reached each couple in the lamp-light their voices wavered, and
ceased; their arms enlaced, their eyes began seeking, searching,
probing the blackness. Suddenly, as though drawn by invisible
hands, they, too, stepped over the railing, and, silent as shadows,
were gone from the light.</p>

<p>The stillness, enclosed in the far, inexorable roar of the town,
was alive with the myriad passions, hopes, and loves of multitudes
of struggling human atoms; for in spite of the disapproval of that
great body of Forsytes, the Municipal Council&mdash;to whom Love
had long been considered, next to the Sewage Question, the gravest
danger to the community&mdash;a process was going on that night in
the Park, and in a hundred other parks, without which the thousand
factories, churches, shops, taxes, and drains, of which they were
custodians, were as arteries without blood, a man without a
heart.</p>

<p>The instincts of self-forgetfulness, of passion, and of love,
hiding under the trees, away from the trustees of their remorseless
enemy, the 'sense of property,' were holding a stealthy revel, and
Soames, returning from Bayswater for he had been alone to dine at
Timothy's walking home along the water, with his mind upon that
coming lawsuit, had the blood driven from his heart by a low laugh
and the sound of kisses. He thought of writing to the Times the
next morning, to draw the attention of the Editor to the condition
of our parks. He did not, however, for he had a horror of seeing
his name in print.</p>

<p>But starved as he was, the whispered sounds in the stillness,
the half-seen forms in the dark, acted on him like some morbid
stimulant. He left the path along the water and stole under the
trees, along the deep shadow of little plantations, where the
boughs of chestnut trees hung their great leaves low, and there was
blacker refuge, shaping his course in circles which had for their
object a stealthy inspection of chairs side by side, against
tree-trunks, of enlaced lovers, who stirred at his approach.</p>

<p>Now he stood still on the rise overlooking the Serpentine,
where, in full lamp-light, black against the silver water, sat a
couple who never moved, the woman's face buried on the man's
neck&mdash;a single form, like a carved emblem of passion, silent
and unashamed.</p>

<p>And, stung by the sight, Soames hurried on deeper into the
shadow of the trees.</p>

<p>In this search, who knows what he thought and what he sought?
Bread for hunger&mdash;light in darkness? Who knows what he
expected to find&mdash;impersonal knowledge of the human
heart&mdash;the end of his private subterranean tragedy&mdash;for,
again, who knew, but that each dark couple, unnamed, unnameable,
might not be he and she?</p>

<p>But it could not be such knowledge as this that he was
seeking&mdash;the wife of Soames Forsyte sitting in the Park like a
common wench! Such thoughts were inconceivable; and from tree to
tree, with his noiseless step, he passed.</p>

<p>Once he was sworn at; once the whisper, "If only it could always
be like this!" sent the blood flying again from his heart, and he
waited there, patient and dogged, for the two to move. But it was
only a poor thin slip of a shop-girl in her draggled blouse who
passed him, clinging to her lover's arm.</p>

<p>A hundred other lovers too whispered that hope in the stillness
of the trees, a hundred other lovers clung to each other.</p>

<p>But shaking himself with sudden disgust, Soames returned to the
path, and left that seeking for he knew not what.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER III&mdash;MEETING AT THE BOTANICAL</h3>

<p>Young Jolyon, whose circumstances were not those of a Forsyte,
found at times a difficulty in sparing the money needful for those
country jaunts and researches into Nature, without having
prosecuted which no watercolour artist ever puts brush to
paper.</p>

<p>He was frequently, in fact, obliged to take his colour-box into
the Botanical Gardens, and there, on his stool, in the shade of a
monkey-puzzler or in the lee of some India-rubber plant, he would
spend long hours sketching.</p>

<p>An Art critic who had recently been looking at his work had
delivered himself as follows:</p>

<p>"In a way your drawings are very good; tone and colour, in some
of them certainly quite a feeling for Nature. But, you see, they're
so scattered; you'll never get the public to look at them. Now, if
you'd taken a definite subject, such as 'London by Night,' or 'The
Crystal Palace in the Spring,' and made a regular series, the
public would have known at once what they were looking at. I can't
lay too much stress upon that. All the men who are making great
names in Art, like Crum Stone or Bleeder, are making them by
avoiding the unexpected; by specializing and putting their works
all in the same pigeon-hole, so that the public know pat once where
to go. And this stands to reason, for if a man's a collector he
doesn't want people to smell at the canvas to find out whom his
pictures are by; he wants them to be able to say at once, 'A
capital Forsyte!' It is all the more important for you to be
careful to choose a subject that they can lay hold of on the spot,
since there's no very marked originality in your style."</p>

<p>Young Jolyon, standing by the little piano, where a bowl of
dried rose leaves, the only produce of the garden, was deposited on
a bit of faded damask, listened with his dim smile.</p>

<p>Turning to his wife, who was looking at the speaker with an
angry expression on her thin face, he said:</p>

<p>"You see, dear?"</p>

<p>"I do not," she answered in her staccato voice, that still had a
little foreign accent; "your style has originality."</p>

<p>The critic looked at her, smiled' deferentially, and said no
more. Like everyone else, he knew their history.</p>

<p>The words bore good fruit with young Jolyon; they were contrary
to all that he believed in, to all that he theoretically held good
in his Art, but some strange, deep instinct moved him against his
will to turn them to profit.</p>

<p>He discovered therefore one morning that an idea had come to him
for making a series of watercolour drawings of London. How the idea
had arisen he could not tell; and it was not till the following
year, when he had completed and sold them at a very fair price,
that in one of his impersonal moods, he found himself able to
recollect the Art critic, and to discover in his own achievement
another proof that he was a Forsyte.</p>

<p>He decided to commence with the Botanical Gardens, where he had
already made so many studies, and chose the little artificial pond,
sprinkled now with an autumn shower of red and yellow leaves, for
though the gardeners longed to sweep them off, they could not reach
them with their brooms. The rest of the gardens they swept bare
enough, removing every morning Nature's rain of leaves; piling them
in heaps, whence from slow fires rose the sweet, acrid smoke that,
like the cuckoo's note for spring, the scent of lime trees for the
summer, is the true emblem of the fall. The gardeners' tidy souls
could not abide the gold and green and russet pattern on the grass.
The gravel paths must lie unstained, ordered, methodical, without
knowledge of the realities of life, nor of that slow and beautiful
decay which flings crowns underfoot to star the earth with fallen
glories, whence, as the cycle rolls, will leap again wild
spring.</p>

<p>Thus each leaf that fell was marked from the moment when it
fluttered a good-bye and dropped, slow turning, from its twig.</p>

<p>But on that little pond the leaves floated in peace, and praised
Heaven with their hues, the sunlight haunting over them.</p>

<p>And so young Jolyon found them.</p>

<p>Coming there one morning in the middle of October, he was
disconcerted to find a bench about twenty paces from his stand
occupied, for he had a proper horror of anyone seeing him at
work.</p>

<p>A lady in a velvet jacket was sitting there, with her eyes fixed
on the ground. A flowering laurel, however, stood between, and,
taking shelter behind this, young Jolyon prepared his easel.</p>

<p>His preparations were leisurely; he caught, as every true artist
should, at anything that might delay for a moment the effort of his
work, and he found himself looking furtively at this unknown
dame.</p>

<p>Like his father before him, he had an eye for a face. This face
was charming!</p>

<p>He saw a rounded chin nestling in a cream ruffle, a delicate
face with large dark eyes and soft lips. A black 'picture' hat
concealed the hair; her figure was lightly poised against the back
of the bench, her knees were crossed; the tip of a patent-leather
shoe emerged beneath her skirt. There was something, indeed,
inexpressibly dainty about the person of this lady, but young
Jolyon's attention was chiefly riveted by the look on her face,
which reminded him of his wife. It was as though its owner had come
into contact with forces too strong for her. It troubled him,
arousing vague feelings of attraction and chivalry. Who was she?
And what doing there, alone?</p>

<p>Two young gentlemen of that peculiar breed, at once forward and
shy, found in the Regent's Park, came by on their way to lawn
tennis, and he noted with disapproval their furtive stares of
admiration. A loitering gardener halted to do something unnecessary
to a clump of pampas grass; he, too, wanted an excuse for peeping.
A gentleman, old, and, by his hat, a professor of horticulture,
passed three times to scrutinize her long and stealthily, a queer
expression about his lips.</p>

<p>With all these men young Jolyon felt the same vague irritation.
She looked at none of them, yet was he certain that every man who
passed would look at her like that.</p>

<p>Her face was not the face of a sorceress, who in every look
holds out to men the offer of pleasure; it had none of the 'devil's
beauty' so highly prized among the first Forsytes of the land;
neither was it of that type, no less adorable, associated with the
box of chocolate; it was not of the spiritually passionate, or
passionately spiritual order, peculiar to house-decoration and
modern poetry; nor did it seem to promise to the playwright
material for the production of the interesting and neurasthenic
figure, who commits suicide in the last act.</p>

<p>In shape and colouring, in its soft persuasive passivity, its
sensuous purity, this woman's face reminded him of Titian's
'Heavenly Love,' a reproduction of which hung over the sideboard in
his dining-room. And her attraction seemed to be in this soft
passivity, in the feeling she gave that to pressure she must
yield.</p>

<p>For what or whom was she waiting, in the silence, with the trees
dropping here and there a leaf, and the thrushes strutting close on
grass, touched with the sparkle of the autumn rime? Then her
charming face grew eager, and, glancing round, with almost a
lover's jealousy, young Jolyon saw Bosinney striding across the
grass.</p>

<p>Curiously he watched the meeting, the look in their eyes, the
long clasp of their hands. They sat down close together, linked for
all their outward discretion. He heard the rapid murmur of their
talk; but what they said he could not catch.</p>

<p>He had rowed in the galley himself! He knew the long hours of
waiting and the lean minutes of a half-public meeting; the tortures
of suspense that haunt the unhallowed lover.</p>

<p>It required, however, but a glance at their two faces to see
that this was none of those affairs of a season that distract men
and women about town; none of those sudden appetites that wake up
ravening, and are surfeited and asleep again in six weeks. This was
the real thing! This was what had happened to himself! Out of this
anything might come!</p>

<p>Bosinney was pleading, and she so quiet, so soft, yet immovable
in her passivity, sat looking over the grass.</p>

<p>Was he the man to carry her off, that tender, passive being, who
would never stir a step for herself? Who had given him all herself,
and would die for him, but perhaps would never run away with
him!</p>

<p>It seemed to young Jolyon that he could hear her saying: "But,
darling, it would ruin you!" For he himself had experienced to the
full the gnawing fear at the bottom of each woman's heart that she
is a drag on the man she loves.</p>

<p>And he peeped at them no more; but their soft, rapid talk came
to his ears, with the stuttering song of some bird who seemed
trying to remember the notes of spring: Joy&mdash;tragedy?
Which&mdash;which?</p>

<p>And gradually their talk ceased; long silence followed.</p>

<p>'And where does Soames come in?' young Jolyon thought. 'People
think she is concerned about the sin of deceiving her husband!
Little they know of women! She's eating, after
starvation&mdash;taking her revenge! And Heaven help her&mdash;for
he'll take his.'</p>

<p>He heard the swish of silk, and, spying round the laurel, saw
them walking away, their hands stealthily joined...</p>

<p>At the end of July old Jolyon had taken his grand-daughter to
the mountains; and on that visit (the last they ever paid) June
recovered to a great extent her health and spirits. In the hotels,
filled with British Forsytes&mdash;for old Jolyon could not bear a
'set of Germans,' as he called all foreigners&mdash;she was looked
upon with respect&mdash;the only grand-daughter of that
fine-looking, and evidently wealthy, old Mr. Forsyte. She did not
mix freely with people&mdash;to mix freely with people was not
June's habit&mdash;but she formed some friendships, and notably one
in the Rhone Valley, with a French girl who was dying of
consumption.</p>

<p>Determining at once that her friend should not die, she forgot,
in the institution of a campaign against Death, much of her own
trouble.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon watched the new intimacy with relief and disapproval;
for this additional proof that her life was to be passed amongst
'lame ducks' worried him. Would she never make a friendship or take
an interest in something that would be of real benefit to her?</p>

<p>'Taking up with a parcel of foreigners,' he called it. He often,
however, brought home grapes or roses, and presented them to
'Mam'zelle' with an ingratiating twinkle.</p>

<p>Towards the end of September, in spite of June's disapproval,
Mademoiselle Vigor breathed her last in the little hotel at St.
Luc, to which they had moved her; and June took her defeat so
deeply to heart that old Jolyon carried her away to Paris. Here, in
contemplation of the 'Venus de Milo' and the 'Madeleine,' she shook
off her depression, and when, towards the middle of October, they
returned to town, her grandfather believed that he had effected a
cure.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, had they established themselves in Stanhope
Gate than he perceived to his dismay a return of her old absorbed
and brooding manner. She would sit, staring in front of her, her
chin on her hand, like a little Norse spirit, grim and intent,
while all around in the electric light, then just installed, shone
the great, drawing-room brocaded up to the frieze, full of
furniture from Baple and Pullbred's. And in the huge gilt mirror
were reflected those Dresden china groups of young men in tight
knee breeches, at the feet of full-bosomed ladies nursing on their
laps pet lambs, which old Jolyon had bought when he was a bachelor
and thought so highly of in these days of degenerate taste. He was
a man of most open mind, who, more than any Forsyte of them all,
had moved with the times, but he could never forget that he had
bought these groups at Jobson's, and given a lot of money for them.
He often said to June, with a sort of disillusioned contempt:</p>

<p>"You don't care about them! They're not the gimcrack things you
and your friends like, but they cost me seventy pounds!" He was not
a man who allowed his taste to be warped when he knew for solid
reasons that it was sound.</p>

<p>One of the first things that June did on getting home was to go
round to Timothy's. She persuaded herself that it was her duty to
call there, and cheer him with an account of all her travels; but
in reality she went because she knew of no other place where, by
some random speech, or roundabout question, she could glean news of
Bosinney.</p>

<p>They received her most cordially: And how was her dear
grandfather? He had not been to see them since May. Her Uncle
Timothy was very poorly, he had had a lot of trouble with the
chimney-sweep in his bedroom; the stupid man had let the soot down
the chimney! It had quite upset her uncle.</p>

<p>June sat there a long time, dreading, yet passionately hoping,
that they would speak of Bosinney.</p>

<p>But paralyzed by unaccountable discretion, Mrs. Septimus Small
let fall no word, neither did she question June about him. In
desperation the girl asked at last whether Soames and Irene were in
town&mdash;she had not yet been to see anyone.</p>

<p>It was Aunt Hester who replied: Oh, yes, they were in town, they
had not been away at all. There was some little difficulty about
the house, she believed. June had heard, no doubt! She had better
ask her Aunt Juley!</p>

<p>June turned to Mrs. Small, who sat upright in her chair, her
hands clasped, her face covered with innumerable pouts. In answer
to the girl's look she maintained a strange silence, and when she
spoke it was to ask June whether she had worn night-socks up in
those high hotels where it must be so cold of a night.</p>

<p>June answered that she had not, she hated the stuffy things; and
rose to leave.</p>

<p>Mrs. Small's infallibly chosen silence was far more ominous to
her than anything that could have been said.</p>

<p>Before half an hour was over she had dragged the truth from Mrs.
Baynes in Lowndes Square, that Soames was bringing an action
against Bosinney over the decoration of the house.</p>

<p>Instead of disturbing her, the news had a strangely calming
effect; as though she saw in the prospect of this struggle new hope
for herself. She learnt that the case was expected to come on in
about a month, and there seemed little or no prospect of Bosinney's
success.</p>

<p>"And whatever he'll do I can't think," said Mrs. Baynes; "it's
very dreadful for him, you know&mdash;he's got no money&mdash;he's
very hard up. And we can't help him, I'm sure. I'm told the
money-lenders won't lend if you have no security, and he has
none&mdash;none at all."</p>

<p>Her embonpoint had increased of late; she was in the full swing
of autumn organization, her writing-table literally strewn with the
menus of charity functions. She looked meaningly at June, with her
round eyes of parrot-grey.</p>

<p>The sudden flush that rose on the girl's intent young
face&mdash;she must have seen spring up before her a great
hope&mdash;the sudden sweetness of her smile, often came back to
Lady Baynes in after years (Baynes was knighted when he built that
public Museum of Art which has given so much employment to
officials, and so little pleasure to those working classes for whom
it was designed).</p>

<p>The memory of that change, vivid and touching, like the breaking
open of a flower, or the first sun after long winter, the memory,
too, of all that came after, often intruded itself, unaccountably,
inopportunely on Lady Baynes, when her mind was set upon the most
important things.</p>

<p>This was the very afternoon of the day that young Jolyon
witnessed the meeting in the Botanical Gardens, and on this day,
too, old Jolyon paid a visit to his solicitors, Forsyte, Bustard,
and Forsyte, in the Poultry. Soames was not in, he had gone down to
Somerset House; Bustard was buried up to the hilt in papers and
that inaccessible apartment, where he was judiciously placed, in
order that he might do as much work as possible; but James was in
the front office, biting a finger, and lugubriously turning over
the pleadings in Forsyte v. Bosinney.</p>

<p>This sound lawyer had only a sort of luxurious dread of the
'nice point,' enough to set up a pleasurable feeling of fuss; for
his good practical sense told him that if he himself were on the
Bench he would not pay much attention to it. But he was afraid that
this Bosinney would go bankrupt and Soames would have to find the
money after all, and costs into the bargain. And behind this
tangible dread there was always that intangible trouble, lurking in
the background, intricate, dim, scandalous, like a bad dream, and
of which this action was but an outward and visible sign.</p>

<p>He raised his head as old Jolyon came in, and muttered: "How are
you, Jolyon? Haven't seen you for an age. You've been to
Switzerland, they tell me. This young Bosinney, he's got himself
into a mess. I knew how it would be!" He held out the papers,
regarding his elder brother with nervous gloom.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon read them in silence, and while he read them James
looked at the floor, biting his fingers the while.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon pitched them down at last, and they fell with a thump
amongst a mass of affidavits in 're Buncombe, deceased,' one of the
many branches of that parent and profitable tree, 'Fryer v.
Forsyte.'</p>

<p>"I don't know what Soames is about," he said, "to make a fuss
over a few hundred pounds. I thought he was a man of property."</p>

<p>James' long upper lip twitched angrily; he could not bear his
son to be attacked in such a spot.</p>

<p>"It's not the money," he began, but meeting his brother's
glance, direct, shrewd, judicial, he stopped.</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>"I've come in for my Will," said old Jolyon at last, tugging at
his moustache.</p>

<p>James' curiosity was roused at once. Perhaps nothing in this
life was more stimulating to him than a Will; it was the supreme
deal with property, the final inventory of a man's belongings, the
last word on what he was worth. He sounded the bell.</p>

<p>"Bring in Mr. Jolyon's Will," he said to an anxious, dark-haired
clerk.</p>

<p>"You going to make some alterations?" And through his mind there
flashed the thought: 'Now, am I worth as much as he?'</p>

<p>Old Jolyon put the Will in his breast pocket, and James twisted
his long legs regretfully.</p>

<p>"You've made some nice purchases lately, they tell me," he
said.</p>

<p>"I don't know where you get your information from," answered old
Jolyon sharply. "When's this action coming on? Next month? I can't
tell what you've got in your minds. You must manage your own
affairs; but if you take my advice, you'll settle it out of Court.
Good-bye!" With a cold handshake he was gone.</p>

<p>James, his fixed grey-blue eye corkscrewing round some secret
anxious image, began again to bite his finger.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon took his Will to the offices of the New Colliery
Company, and sat down in the empty Board Room to read it through.
He answered 'Down-by-the-starn' Hemmings so tartly when the latter,
seeing his Chairman seated there, entered with the new
Superintendent's first report, that the Secretary withdrew with
regretful dignity; and sending for the transfer clerk, blew him up
till the poor youth knew not where to look.</p>

<p>It was not&mdash;by George&mdash;as he (Down-by-the-starn) would
have him know, for a whippersnapper of a young fellow like him, to
come down to that office, and think that he was God Almighty. He
(Down-by-the-starn) had been head of that office for more years
than a boy like him could count, and if he thought that when he had
finished all his work, he could sit there doing nothing, he did not
know him, Hemmings (Down-by-the-starn), and so forth.</p>

<p>On the other side of the green baize door old Jolyon sat at the
long, mahogany-and-leather board table, his thick, loose-jointed,
tortoiseshell eye-glasses perched on the bridge of his nose, his
gold pencil moving down the clauses of his Will.</p>

<p>It was a simple affair, for there were none of those vexatious
little legacies and donations to charities, which fritter away a
man's possessions, and damage the majestic effect of that little
paragraph in the morning papers accorded to Forsytes who die with a
hundred thousand pounds.</p>

<p>A simple affair. Just a bequest to his son of twenty thousand,
and 'as to the residue of my property of whatsoever kind whether
realty or personalty, or partaking of the nature of
either&mdash;upon trust to pay the proceeds rents annual produce
dividends or interest thereof and thereon to my said grand-daughter
June Forsyte or her assigns during her life to be for her sole use
and benefit and without, etc... and from and after her death or
decease upon trust to convey assign transfer or make over the said
last-mentioned lands hereditaments premises trust moneys stocks
funds investments and securities or such as shall then stand for
and represent the same unto such person or persons whether one or
more for such intents purposes and uses and generally in such
manner way and form in all respects as the said June Forsyte
notwithstanding coverture shall by her last Will and Testament or
any writing or writings in the nature of a Will testament or
testamentary disposition to be by her duly made signed and
published direct appoint or make over give and dispose of the same
And in default etc...Provided always...' and so on, in seven folios
of brief and simple phraseology.</p>

<p>The Will had been drawn by James in his palmy days. He had
foreseen almost every contingency.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon sat a long time reading this Will; at last he took
half a sheet of paper from the rack, and made a prolonged pencil
note; then buttoning up the Will, he caused a cab to be called and
drove to the offices of Paramor and Herring, in Lincoln's Inn
Fields. Jack Herring was dead, but his nephew was still in the
firm, and old Jolyon was closeted with him for half an hour.</p>

<p>He had kept the hansom, and on coming out, gave the driver the
address&mdash;3, Wistaria Avenue.</p>

<p>He felt a strange, slow satisfaction, as though he had scored a
victory over James and the man of property. They should not poke
their noses into his affairs any more; he had just cancelled their
trusteeships of his Will; he would take the whole of his business
out of their hands, and put it into the hands of young Herring, and
he would move the business of his Companies too. If that young
Soames were such a man of property, he would never miss a thousand
a year or so; and under his great white moustache old Jolyon grimly
smiled. He felt that what he was doing was in the nature of
retributive justice, richly deserved.</p>

<p>Slowly, surely, with the secret inner process that works the
destruction of an old tree, the poison of the wounds to his
happiness, his will, his pride, had corroded the comely edifice of
his philosophy. Life had worn him down on one side, till, like that
family of which he was the head, he had lost balance.</p>

<p>To him, borne northwards towards his son's house, the thought of
the new disposition of property, which he had just set in motion,
appeared vaguely in the light of a stroke of punishment, levelled
at that family and that Society, of which James and his son seemed
to him the representatives. He had made a restitution to young
Jolyon, and restitution to young Jolyon satisfied his secret
craving for revenge-revenge against Time, sorrow, and interference,
against all that incalculable sum of disapproval that had been
bestowed by the world for fifteen years on his only son. It
presented itself as the one possible way of asserting once more the
domination of his will; of forcing James, and Soames, and the
family, and all those hidden masses of Forsytes&mdash;a great
stream rolling against the single dam of his obstinacy&mdash;to
recognise once and for all that he would be master. It was sweet to
think that at last he was going to make the boy a richer man by far
than that son of James, that 'man of property.' And it was sweet to
give to Jo, for he loved his son.</p>

<p>Neither young Jolyon nor his wife were in (young Jolyon indeed
was not back from the Botanical), but the little maid told him that
she expected the master at any moment:</p>

<p>"He's always at 'ome to tea, sir, to play with the
children."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon said he would wait; and sat down patiently enough in
the faded, shabby drawing room, where, now that the summer chintzes
were removed, the old chairs and sofas revealed all their
threadbare deficiencies. He longed to send for the children; to
have them there beside him, their supple bodies against his knees;
to hear Jolly's: "Hallo, Gran!" and see his rush; and feel Holly's
soft little hand stealing up against his cheek. But he would not.
There was solemnity in what he had come to do, and until it was
over he would not play. He amused himself by thinking how with two
strokes of his pen he was going to restore the look of caste so
conspicuously absent from everything in that little house; how he
could fill these rooms, or others in some larger mansion, with
triumphs of art from Baple and Pullbred's; how he could send little
Jolly to Harrow and Oxford (he no longer had faith in Eton and
Cambridge, for his son had been there); how he could procure little
Holly the best musical instruction, the child had a remarkable
aptitude.</p>

<p>As these visions crowded before him, causing emotion to swell
his heart, he rose, and stood at the window, looking down into the
little walled strip of garden, where the pear-tree, bare of leaves
before its time, stood with gaunt branches in the slow-gathering
mist of the autumn afternoon. The dog Balthasar, his tail curled
tightly over a piebald, furry back, was walking at the farther end,
sniffing at the plants, and at intervals placing his leg for
support against the wall.</p>

<p>And old Jolyon mused.</p>

<p>What pleasure was there left but to give? It was pleasant to
give, when you could find one who would be thankful for what you
gave&mdash;one of your own flesh and blood! There was no such
satisfaction to be had out of giving to those who did not belong to
you, to those who had no claim on you! Such giving as that was a
betrayal of the individualistic convictions and actions of his
life, of all his enterprise, his labour, and his moderation, of the
great and proud fact that, like tens of thousands of Forsytes
before him, tens of thousands in the present, tens of thousands in
the future, he had always made his own, and held his own, in the
world.</p>

<p>And, while he stood there looking down on the smut-covered
foliage of the laurels, the black-stained grass-plot, the progress
of the dog Balthasar, all the suffering of the fifteen years during
which he had been baulked of legitimate enjoyment mingled its gall
with the sweetness of the approaching moment.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon came at last, pleased with his work, and fresh from
long hours in the open air. On hearing that his father was in the
drawing room, he inquired hurriedly whether Mrs. Forsyte was at
home, and being informed that she was not, heaved a sigh of relief.
Then putting his painting materials carefully in the little
coat-closet out of sight, he went in.</p>

<p>With characteristic decision old Jolyon came at once to the
point. "I've been altering my arrangements, Jo," he said. "You can
cut your coat a bit longer in the future&mdash;I'm settling a
thousand a year on you at once. June will have fifty thousand at my
death; and you the rest. That dog of yours is spoiling the garden.
I shouldn't keep a dog, if I were you!"</p>

<p>The dog Balthasar, seated in the centre of the lawn, was
examining his tail.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon looked at the animal, but saw him dimly, for his
eyes were misty.</p>

<p>"Yours won't come short of a hundred thousand, my boy," said old
Jolyon; "I thought you'd better know. I haven't much longer to live
at my age. I shan't allude to it again. How's your wife?
And&mdash;give her my love."</p>

<p>Young Jolyon put his hand on his father's shoulder, and, as
neither spoke, the episode closed.</p>

<p>Having seen his father into a hansom, young Jolyon came back to
the drawing-room and stood, where old Jolyon had stood, looking
down on the little garden. He tried to realize all that this meant
to him, and, Forsyte that he was, vistas of property were opened
out in his brain; the years of half rations through which he had
passed had not sapped his natural instincts. In extremely practical
form, he thought of travel, of his wife's costume, the children's
education, a pony for Jolly, a thousand things; but in the midst of
all he thought, too, of Bosinney and his mistress, and the broken
song of the thrush. Joy&mdash;tragedy! Which? Which?</p>

<p>The old past&mdash;the poignant, suffering, passionate,
wonderful past, that no money could buy, that nothing could restore
in all its burning sweetness&mdash;had come back before him.</p>

<p>When his wife came in he went straight up to her and took her in
his arms; and for a long time he stood without speaking, his eyes
closed, pressing her to him, while she looked at him with a
wondering, adoring, doubting look in her eyes.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER IV&mdash;VOYAGE INTO THE INFERNO</h3>

<p>The morning after a certain night on which Soames at last
asserted his rights and acted like a man, he breakfasted alone.</p>

<p>He breakfasted by gaslight, the fog of late November wrapping
the town as in some monstrous blanket till the trees of the Square
even were barely visible from the dining-room window.</p>

<p>He ate steadily, but at times a sensation as though he could not
swallow attacked him. Had he been right to yield to his
overmastering hunger of the night before, and break down the
resistance which he had suffered now too long from this woman who
was his lawful and solemnly constituted helpmate?</p>

<p>He was strangely haunted by the recollection of her face, from
before which, to soothe her, he had tried to pull her
hands&mdash;of her terrible smothered sobbing, the like of which he
had never heard, and still seemed to hear; and he was still haunted
by the odd, intolerable feeling of remorse and shame he had felt,
as he stood looking at her by the flame of the single candle,
before silently slinking away.</p>

<p>And somehow, now that he had acted like this, he was surprised
at himself.</p>

<p>Two nights before, at Winifred Dartie's, he had taken Mrs.
MacAnder into dinner. She had said to him, looking in his face with
her sharp, greenish eyes: "And so your wife is a great friend of
that Mr. Bosinney's?"</p>

<p>Not deigning to ask what she meant, he had brooded over her
words.</p>

<p>They had roused in him a fierce jealousy, which, with the
peculiar perversion of this instinct, had turned to fiercer
desire.</p>

<p>Without the incentive of Mrs. MacAnder's words he might never
have done what he had done. Without their incentive and the
accident of finding his wife's door for once unlocked, which had
enabled him to steal upon her asleep.</p>

<p>Slumber had removed his doubts, but the morning brought them
again. One thought comforted him: No one would know&mdash;it was
not the sort of thing that she would speak about.</p>

<p>And, indeed, when the vehicle of his daily business life, which
needed so imperatively the grease of clear and practical thought,
started rolling once more with the reading of his letters, those
nightmare-like doubts began to assume less extravagant importance
at the back of his mind. The incident was really not of great
moment; women made a fuss about it in books; but in the cool
judgment of right-thinking men, of men of the world, of such as he
recollected often received praise in the Divorce Court, he had but
done his best to sustain the sanctity of marriage, to prevent her
from abandoning her duty, possibly, if she were still seeing
Bosinney, from...</p>

<p>No, he did not regret it.</p>

<p>Now that the first step towards reconciliation had been taken,
the rest would be comparatively&mdash;comparatively...</p>

<p>He, rose and walked to the window. His nerve had been shaken.
The sound of smothered sobbing was in his ears again. He could not
get rid of it.</p>

<p>He put on his fur coat, and went out into the fog; having to go
into the City, he took the underground railway from Sloane Square
station.</p>

<p>In his corner of the first-class compartment filled with City
men the smothered sobbing still haunted him, so he opened the Times
with the rich crackle that drowns all lesser sounds, and,
barricaded behind it, set himself steadily to con the news.</p>

<p>He read that a Recorder had charged a grand jury on the previous
day with a more than usually long list of offences. He read of
three murders, five manslaughters, seven arsons, and as many as
eleven rapes&mdash;a surprisingly high number&mdash;in addition to
many less conspicuous crimes, to be tried during a coming Sessions;
and from one piece of news he went on to another, keeping the paper
well before his face.</p>

<p>And still, inseparable from his reading, was the memory of
Irene's tear-stained face, and the sounds from her broken
heart.</p>

<p>The day was a busy one, including, in addition to the ordinary
affairs of his practice, a visit to his brokers, Messrs. Grin and
Grinning, to give them instructions to sell his shares in the New
Colliery Co., Ltd., whose business he suspected, rather than knew,
was stagnating (this enterprise afterwards slowly declined, and was
ultimately sold for a song to an American syndicate); and a long
conference at Waterbuck, Q.C.'s chambers, attended by Boulter, by
Fiske, the junior counsel, and Waterbuck, Q.C., himself.</p>

<p>The case of Forsyte v. Bosinney was expected to be reached on
the morrow, before Mr. Justice Bentham.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Bentham, a man of common-sense rather than too great
legal knowledge, was considered to be about the best man they could
have to try the action. He was a 'strong' Judge.</p>

<p>Waterbuck, Q.C., in pleasing conjunction with an almost rude
neglect of Boulter and Fiske paid to Soames a good deal of
attention, by instinct or the sounder evidence of rumour, feeling
him to be a man of property.</p>

<p>He held with remarkable consistency to the opinion he had
already expressed in writing, that the issue would depend to a
great extent on the evidence given at the trial, and in a few well
directed remarks he advised Soames not to be too careful in giving
that evidence. "A little bluffness, Mr. Forsyte," he said, "a
little bluffness," and after he had spoken he laughed firmly,
closed his lips tight, and scratched his head just below where he
had pushed his wig back, for all the world like the
gentleman-farmer for whom he loved to be taken. He was considered
perhaps the leading man in breach of promise cases.</p>

<p>Soames used the underground again in going home.</p>

<p>The fog was worse than ever at Sloane Square station. Through
the still, thick blur, men groped in and out; women, very few,
grasped their reticules to their bosoms and handkerchiefs to their
mouths; crowned with the weird excrescence of the driver, haloed by
a vague glow of lamp-light that seemed to drown in vapour before it
reached the pavement, cabs loomed dim-shaped ever and again, and
discharged citizens, bolting like rabbits to their burrows.</p>

<p>And these shadowy figures, wrapped each in his own little shroud
of fog, took no notice of each other. In the great warren, each
rabbit for himself, especially those clothed in the more expensive
fur, who, afraid of carriages on foggy days, are driven
underground.</p>

<p>One figure, however, not far from Soames, waited at the station
door.</p>

<p>Some buccaneer or lover, of whom each Forsyte thought: 'Poor
devil! looks as if he were having a bad time!' Their kind hearts
beat a stroke faster for that poor, waiting, anxious lover in the
fog; but they hurried by, well knowing that they had neither time
nor money to spare for any suffering but their own.</p>

<p>Only a policeman, patrolling slowly and at intervals, took an
interest in that waiting figure, the brim of whose slouch hat half
hid a face reddened by the cold, all thin, and haggard, over which
a hand stole now and again to smooth away anxiety, or renew the
resolution that kept him waiting there. But the waiting lover (if
lover he were) was used to policemen's scrutiny, or too absorbed in
his anxiety, for he never flinched. A hardened case, accustomed to
long trysts, to anxiety, and fog, and cold, if only his mistress
came at last. Foolish lover! Fogs last until the spring; there is
also snow and rain, no comfort anywhere; gnawing fear if you bring
her out, gnawing fear if you bid her stay at home!</p>

<p>"Serve him right; he should arrange his affairs better!"</p>

<p>So any respectable Forsyte. Yet, if that sounder citizen could
have listened at the waiting lover's heart, out there in the fog
and the cold, he would have said again: "Yes, poor devil he's
having a bad time!"</p>

<p>Soames got into his cab, and, with the glass down, crept along
Sloane Street, and so along the Brompton Road, and home. He reached
his house at five.</p>

<p>His wife was not in. She had gone out a quarter of an hour
before. Out at such a time of night, into this terrible fog! What
was the meaning of that?</p>

<p>He sat by the dining-room fire, with the door open, disturbed to
the soul, trying to read the evening paper. A book was no
good&mdash;in daily papers alone was any narcotic to such worry as
his. From the customary events recorded in the journal he drew some
comfort. 'Suicide of an actress'&mdash;'Grave indisposition of a
Statesman' (that chronic sufferer)&mdash;'Divorce of an army
officer'&mdash;'Fire in a colliery'&mdash;he read them all. They
helped him a little&mdash;prescribed by the greatest of all
doctors, our natural taste.</p>

<p>It was nearly seven when he heard her come in.</p>

<p>The incident of the night before had long lost its importance
under stress of anxiety at her strange sortie into the fog. But now
that Irene was home, the memory of her broken-hearted sobbing came
back to him, and he felt nervous at the thought of facing her.</p>

<p>She was already on the stairs; her grey fur coat hung to her
knees, its high collar almost hid her face, she wore a thick
veil.</p>

<p>She neither turned to look at him nor spoke. No ghost or
stranger could have passed more silently.</p>

<p>Bilson came to lay dinner, and told him that Mrs. Forsyte was
not coming down; she was having the soup in her room.</p>

<p>For once Soames did not 'change'; it was, perhaps, the first
time in his life that he had sat down to dinner with soiled cuffs,
and, not even noticing them, he brooded long over his wine. He sent
Bilson to light a fire in his picture-room, and presently went up
there himself.</p>

<p>Turning on the gas, he heaved a deep sigh, as though amongst
these treasures, the backs of which confronted him in stacks,
around the little room, he had found at length his peace of mind.
He went straight up to the greatest treasure of them all, an
undoubted Turner, and, carrying it to the easel, turned its face to
the light. There had been a movement in Turners, but he had not
been able to make up his mind to part with it. He stood for a long
time, his pale, clean-shaven face poked forward above his stand-up
collar, looking at the picture as though he were adding it up; a
wistful expression came into his eyes; he found, perhaps, that it
came to too little. He took it down from the easel to put it back
against the wall; but, in crossing the room, stopped, for he seemed
to hear sobbing.</p>

<p>It was nothing&mdash;only the sort of thing that had been
bothering him in the morning. And soon after, putting the high
guard before the blazing fire, he stole downstairs.</p>

<p>Fresh for the morrow! was his thought. It was long before he
went to sleep...</p>

<p>It is now to George Forsyte that the mind must turn for light on
the events of that fog-engulfed afternoon.</p>

<p>The wittiest and most sportsmanlike of the Forsytes had passed
the day reading a novel in the paternal mansion at Princes'
Gardens. Since a recent crisis in his financial affairs he had been
kept on parole by Roger, and compelled to reside 'at home.'</p>

<p>Towards five o'clock he went out, and took train at South
Kensington Station (for everyone to-day went Underground). His
intention was to dine, and pass the evening playing billiards at
the Red Pottle&mdash;that unique hostel, neither club, hotel, nor
good gilt restaurant.</p>

<p>He got out at Charing Cross, choosing it in preference to his
more usual St. James's Park, that he might reach Jermyn Street by
better lighted ways.</p>

<p>On the platform his eyes&mdash;for in combination with a
composed and fashionable appearance, George had sharp eyes, and was
always on the look-out for fillips to his sardonic humour&mdash;his
eyes were attracted by a man, who, leaping from a first-class
compartment, staggered rather than walked towards the exit.</p>

<p>'So ho, my bird!' said George to himself; 'why, it's "the
Buccaneer!"' and he put his big figure on the trail. Nothing
afforded him greater amusement than a drunken man.</p>

<p>Bosinney, who wore a slouch hat, stopped in front of him, spun
around, and rushed back towards the carriage he had just left. He
was too late. A porter caught him by the coat; the train was
already moving on.</p>

<p>George's practised glance caught sight of the face of a lady
clad in a grey fur coat at the carriage window. It was Mrs.
Soames&mdash;and George felt that this was interesting!</p>

<p>And now he followed Bosinney more closely than ever&mdash;up the
stairs, past the ticket collector into the street. In that
progress, however, his feelings underwent a change; no longer
merely curious and amused, he felt sorry for the poor fellow he was
shadowing. 'The Buccaneer' was not drunk, but seemed to be acting
under the stress of violent emotion; he was talking to himself, and
all that George could catch were the words "Oh, God!" Nor did he
appear to know what he was doing, or where going; but stared,
hesitated, moved like a man out of his mind; and from being merely
a joker in search of amusement, George felt that he must see the
poor chap through.</p>

<p>He had 'taken the knock'&mdash;'taken the knock!' And he
wondered what on earth Mrs. Soames had been saying, what on earth
she had been telling him in the railway carriage. She had looked
bad enough herself! It made George sorry to think of her travelling
on with her trouble all alone.</p>

<p>He followed close behind Bosinney's elbow&mdash;tall, burly
figure, saying nothing, dodging warily&mdash;and shadowed him out
into the fog.</p>

<p>There was something here beyond a jest! He kept his head
admirably, in spite of some excitement, for in addition to
compassion, the instincts of the chase were roused within him.</p>

<p>Bosinney walked right out into the thoroughfare&mdash;a vast
muffled blackness, where a man could not see six paces before him;
where, all around, voices or whistles mocked the sense of
direction; and sudden shapes came rolling slow upon them; and now
and then a light showed like a dim island in an infinite dark
sea.</p>

<p>And fast into this perilous gulf of night walked Bosinney, and
fast after him walked George. If the fellow meant to put his
'twopenny' under a 'bus, he would stop it if he could! Across the
street and back the hunted creature strode, not groping as other
men were groping in that gloom, but driven forward as though the
faithful George behind wielded a knout; and this chase after a
haunted man began to have for George the strangest fascination.</p>

<p>But it was now that the affair developed in a way which ever
afterwards caused it to remain green in his mind. Brought to a
stand-still in the fog, he heard words which threw a sudden light
on these proceedings. What Mrs. Soames had said to Bosinney in the
train was now no longer dark. George understood from those
mutterings that Soames had exercised his rights over an estranged
and unwilling wife in the greatest&mdash;the supreme act of
property.</p>

<p>His fancy wandered in the fields of this situation; it impressed
him; he guessed something of the anguish, the sexual confusion and
horror in Bosinney's heart. And he thought: 'Yes, it's a bit thick!
I don't wonder the poor fellow is half-cracked!'</p>

<p>He had run his quarry to earth on a bench under one of the lions
in Trafalgar Square, a monster sphynx astray like themselves in
that gulf of darkness. Here, rigid and silent, sat Bosinney, and
George, in whose patience was a touch of strange brotherliness,
took his stand behind. He was not lacking in a certain
delicacy&mdash;a sense of form&mdash;that did not permit him to
intrude upon this tragedy, and he waited, quiet as the lion above,
his fur collar hitched above his ears concealing the fleshy redness
of his cheeks, concealing all but his eyes with their sardonic,
compassionate stare. And men kept passing back from business on the
way to their clubs&mdash;men whose figures shrouded in cocoons of
fog came into view like spectres, and like spectres vanished. Then
even in his compassion George's Quilpish humour broke forth in a
sudden longing to pluck these spectres by the sleeve, and say:</p>

<p>"Hi, you Johnnies! You don't often see a show like this! Here's
a poor devil whose mistress has just been telling him a pretty
little story of her husband; walk up, walk up! He's taken the
knock, you see."</p>

<p>In fancy he saw them gaping round the tortured lover; and
grinned as he thought of some respectable, newly-married spectre
enabled by the state of his own affections to catch an inkling of
what was going on within Bosinney; he fancied he could see his
mouth getting wider and wider, and the fog going down and down. For
in George was all that contempt of the of the married
middle-class&mdash;peculiar to the wild and sportsmanlike spirits
in its ranks.</p>

<p>But he began to be bored. Waiting was not what he had bargained
for.</p>

<p>'After all,' he thought, 'the poor chap will get over it; not
the first time such a thing has happened in this little city!' But
now his quarry again began muttering words of violent hate and
anger. And following a sudden impulse George touched him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>Bosinney spun round.</p>

<p>"Who are you? What do you want?"</p>

<p>George could have stood it well enough in the light of the gas
lamps, in the light of that everyday world of which he was so hardy
a connoisseur; but in this fog, where all was gloomy and unreal,
where nothing had that matter-of-fact value associated by Forsytes
with earth, he was a victim to strange qualms, and as he tried to
stare back into the eyes of this maniac, he thought:</p>

<p>'If I see a bobby, I'll hand him over; he's not fit to be at
large.'</p>

<p>But waiting for no answer, Bosinney strode off into the fog, and
George followed, keeping perhaps a little further off, yet more
than ever set on tracking him down.</p>

<p>'He can't go on long like this,' he thought. 'It's God's own
miracle he's not been run over already.' He brooded no more on
policemen, a sportsman's sacred fire alive again within him.</p>

<p>Into a denser gloom than ever Bosinney held on at a furious
pace; but his pursuer perceived more method in his madness&mdash;he
was clearly making his way westwards.</p>

<p>'He's really going for Soames!' thought George. The idea was
attractive. It would be a sporting end to such a chase. He had
always disliked his cousin.</p>

<p>The shaft of a passing cab brushed against his shoulder and made
him leap aside. He did not intend to be killed for the Buccaneer,
or anyone. Yet, with hereditary tenacity, he stuck to the trail
through vapour that blotted out everything but the shadow of the
hunted man and the dim moon of the nearest lamp.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, with the instinct of a town-stroller, George knew
himself to be in Piccadilly. Here he could find his way blindfold;
and freed from the strain of geographical uncertainty, his mind
returned to Bosinney's trouble.</p>

<p>Down the long avenue of his man-about-town experience, bursting,
as it were, through a smirch of doubtful amours, there stalked to
him a memory of his youth. A memory, poignant still, that brought
the scent of hay, the gleam of moonlight, a summer magic, into the
reek and blackness of this London fog&mdash;the memory of a night
when in the darkest shadow of a lawn he had overheard from a
woman's lips that he was not her sole possessor. And for a moment
George walked no longer in black Piccadilly, but lay again, with
hell in his heart, and his face to the sweet-smelling, dewy grass,
in the long shadow of poplars that hid the moon.</p>

<p>A longing seized him to throw his arm round the Buccaneer, and
say, "Come, old boy. Time cures all. Let's go and drink it
off!"</p>

<p>But a voice yelled at him, and he started back. A cab rolled out
of blackness, and into blackness disappeared. And suddenly George
perceived that he had lost Bosinney. He ran forward and back, felt
his heart clutched by a sickening fear, the dark fear which lives
in the wings of the fog. Perspiration started out on his brow. He
stood quite still, listening with all his might.</p>

<p>"And then," as he confided to Dartie the same evening in the
course of a game of billiards at the Red Pottle, "I lost him."</p>

<p>Dartie twirled complacently at his dark moustache. He had just
put together a neat break of twenty-three,&mdash;failing at a
'Jenny.' "And who was she?" he asked.</p>

<p>George looked slowly at the 'man of the world's' fattish, sallow
face, and a little grim smile lurked about the curves of his cheeks
and his heavy-lidded eyes.</p>

<p>'No, no, my fine fellow,' he thought, 'I'm not going to tell
you.' For though he mixed with Dartie a good deal, he thought him a
bit of a cad.</p>

<p>"Oh, some little love-lady or other," he said, and chalked his
cue.</p>

<p>"A love-lady!" exclaimed Dartie&mdash;he used a more figurative
expression. "I made sure it was our friend Soa..."</p>

<p>"Did you?" said George curtly. "Then damme you've made an
error."</p>

<p>He missed his shot. He was careful not to allude to the subject
again till, towards eleven o'clock, having, in his poetic
phraseology, 'looked upon the drink when it was yellow,' he drew
aside the blind, and gazed out into the street. The murky blackness
of the fog was but faintly broken by the lamps of the 'Red Pottle,'
and no shape of mortal man or thing was in sight.</p>

<p>"I can't help thinking of that poor Buccaneer," he said. "He may
be wandering out there now in that fog. If he's not a corpse," he
added with strange dejection.</p>

<p>"Corpse!" said Dartie, in whom the recollection of his defeat at
Richmond flared up. "He's all right. Ten to one if he wasn't
tight!"</p>

<p>George turned on him, looking really formidable, with a sort of
savage gloom on his big face.</p>

<p>"Dry up!" he said. "Don't I tell you he's 'taken the
knock!"'</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER V&mdash;THE TRIAL</h3>

<p>In the morning of his case, which was second in the list, Soames
was again obliged to start without seeing Irene, and it was just as
well, for he had not as yet made up his mind what attitude to adopt
towards her.</p>

<p>He had been requested to be in court by half-past ten, to
provide against the event of the first action (a breach of promise)
collapsing, which however it did not, both sides showing a courage
that afforded Waterbuck, Q.C., an opportunity for improving his
already great reputation in this class of case. He was opposed by
Ram, the other celebrated breach of promise man. It was a battle of
giants.</p>

<p>The court delivered judgment just before the luncheon interval.
The jury left the box for good, and Soames went out to get
something to eat. He met James standing at the little luncheon-bar,
like a pelican in the wilderness of the galleries, bent over a
sandwich with a glass of sherry before him. The spacious emptiness
of the great central hall, over which father and son brooded as
they stood together, was marred now and then for a fleeting moment
by barristers in wig and gown hurriedly bolting across, by an
occasional old lady or rusty-coated man, looking up in a frightened
way, and by two persons, bolder than their generation, seated in an
embrasure arguing. The sound of their voices arose, together with a
scent as of neglected wells, which, mingling with the odour of the
galleries, combined to form the savour, like nothing but the
emanation of a refined cheese, so indissolubly connected with the
administration of British Justice.</p>

<p>It was not long before James addressed his son.</p>

<p>"When's your case coming on? I suppose it'll be on directly. I
shouldn't wonder if this Bosinney'd say anything; I should think
he'd have to. He'll go bankrupt if it goes against him." He took a
large bite at his sandwich and a mouthful of sherry. "Your mother,"
he said, "wants you and Irene to come and dine to-night."</p>

<p>A chill smile played round Soames' lips; he looked back at his
father. Anyone who had seen the look, cold and furtive, thus
interchanged, might have been pardoned for not appreciating the
real understanding between them. James finished his sherry at a
draught.</p>

<p>"How much?" he asked.</p>

<p>On returning to the court Soames took at once his rightful seat
on the front bench beside his solicitor. He ascertained where his
father was seated with a glance so sidelong as to commit
nobody.</p>

<p>James, sitting back with his hands clasped over the handle of
his umbrella, was brooding on the end of the bench immediately
behind counsel, whence he could get away at once when the case was
over. He considered Bosinney's conduct in every way outrageous, but
he did not wish to run up against him, feeling that the meeting
would be awkward.</p>

<p>Next to the Divorce Court, this court was, perhaps, the
favourite emporium of justice, libel, breach of promise, and other
commercial actions being frequently decided there. Quite a
sprinkling of persons unconnected with the law occupied the back
benches, and the hat of a woman or two could be seen in the
gallery.</p>

<p>The two rows of seats immediately in front of James were
gradually filled by barristers in wigs, who sat down to make pencil
notes, chat, and attend to their teeth; but his interest was soon
diverted from these lesser lights of justice by the entrance of
Waterbuck, Q.C., with the wings of his silk gown rustling, and his
red, capable face supported by two short, brown whiskers. The
famous Q.C. looked, as James freely admitted, the very picture of a
man who could heckle a witness.</p>

<p>For all his experience, it so happened that he had never seen
Waterbuck, Q.C., before, and, like many Forsytes in the lower
branch of the profession, he had an extreme admiration for a good
cross-examiner. The long, lugubrious folds in his cheeks relaxed
somewhat after seeing him, especially as he now perceived that
Soames alone was represented by silk.</p>

<p>Waterbuck, Q.C., had barely screwed round on his elbow to chat
with his Junior before Mr. Justice Bentham himself appeared&mdash;a
thin, rather hen-like man, with a little stoop, clean-shaven under
his snowy wig. Like all the rest of the court, Waterbuck rose, and
remained on his feet until the judge was seated. James rose but
slightly; he was already comfortable, and had no opinion of
Bentham, having sat next but one to him at dinner twice at the
Bumley Tomms'. Bumley Tomm was rather a poor thing, though he had
been so successful. James himself had given him his first brief. He
was excited, too, for he had just found out that Bosinney was not
in court.</p>

<p>'Now, what's he mean by that?' he kept on thinking.</p>

<p>The case having been called on, Waterbuck, Q.C., pushing back
his papers, hitched his gown on his shoulder, and, with a
semi-circular look around him, like a man who is going to bat,
arose and addressed the Court.</p>

<p>The facts, he said, were not in dispute, and all that his
Lordship would be asked was to interpret the correspondence which
had taken place between his client and the defendant, an architect,
with reference to the decoration of a house. He would, however,
submit that this correspondence could only mean one very plain
thing. After briefly reciting the history of the house at Robin
Hill, which he described as a mansion, and the actual facts of
expenditure, he went on as follows:</p>

<p>"My client, Mr. Soames Forsyte, is a gentleman, a man of
property, who would be the last to dispute any legitimate claim
that might be made against him, but he has met with such treatment
from his architect in the matter of this house, over which he has,
as your lordship has heard, already spent some twelve&mdash;some
twelve thousand pounds, a sum considerably in advance of the amount
he had originally contemplated, that as a matter of
principle&mdash;and this I cannot too strongly emphasize&mdash;as a
matter of principle, and in the interests of others, he has felt
himself compelled to bring this action. The point put forward in
defence by the architect I will suggest to your lordship is not
worthy of a moment's serious consideration." He then read the
correspondence.</p>

<p>His client, "a man of recognised position," was prepared to go
into the box, and to swear that he never did authorize, that it was
never in his mind to authorize, the expenditure of any money beyond
the extreme limit of twelve thousand and fifty pounds, which he had
clearly fixed; and not further to waste the time of the court, he
would at once call Mr. Forsyte.</p>

<p>Soames then went into the box. His whole appearance was striking
in its composure. His face, just supercilious enough, pale and
clean-shaven, with a little line between the eyes, and compressed
lips; his dress in unostentatious order, one hand neatly gloved,
the other bare. He answered the questions put to him in a somewhat
low, but distinct voice. His evidence under cross-examination
savoured of taciturnity.</p>

<p>Had he not used the expression, "a free hand"? No.</p>

<p>"Come, come!"</p>

<p>The expression he had used was 'a free hand in the terms of this
correspondence.'</p>

<p>"Would you tell the Court that that was English?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"What do you say it means?"</p>

<p>"What it says!"</p>

<p>"Are you prepared to deny that it is a contradiction in
terms?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are not an Irishman?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Are you a well-educated man?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And yet you persist in that statement?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Throughout this and much more cross-examination, which turned
again and again around the 'nice point,' James sat with his hand
behind his ear, his eyes fixed upon his son.</p>

<p>He was proud of him! He could not but feel that in similar
circumstances he himself would have been tempted to enlarge his
replies, but his instinct told him that this taciturnity was the
very thing. He sighed with relief, however, when Soames, slowly
turning, and without any change of expression, descended from the
box.</p>

<p>When it came to the turn of Bosinney's Counsel to address the
Judge, James redoubled his attention, and he searched the Court
again and again to see if Bosinney were not somewhere
concealed.</p>

<p>Young Chankery began nervously; he was placed by Bosinney's
absence in an awkward position. He therefore did his best to turn
that absence to account.</p>

<p>He could not but fear&mdash;he said&mdash;that his client had
met with an accident. He had fully expected him there to give
evidence; they had sent round that morning both to Mr. Bosinney's
office and to his rooms (though he knew they were one and the same,
he thought it was as well not to say so), but it was not known
where he was, and this he considered to be ominous, knowing how
anxious Mr. Bosinney had been to give his evidence. He had not,
however, been instructed to apply for an adjournment, and in
default of such instruction he conceived it his duty to go on. The
plea on which he somewhat confidently relied, and which his client,
had he not unfortunately been prevented in some way from attending,
would have supported by his evidence, was that such an expression
as a 'free hand' could not be limited, fettered, and rendered
unmeaning, by any verbiage which might follow it. He would go
further and say that the correspondence showed that whatever he
might have said in his evidence, Mr. Forsyte had in fact never
contemplated repudiating liability on any of the work ordered or
executed by his architect. The defendant had certainly never
contemplated such a contingency, or, as was demonstrated by his
letters, he would never have proceeded with the work&mdash;a work
of extreme delicacy, carried out with great care and efficiency, to
meet and satisfy the fastidious taste of a connoisseur, a rich man,
a man of property. He felt strongly on this point, and feeling
strongly he used, perhaps, rather strong words when he said that
this action was of a most unjustifiable, unexpected,
indeed&mdash;unprecedented character. If his Lordship had had the
opportunity that he himself had made it his duty to take, to go
over this very fine house and see the great delicacy and beauty of
the decorations executed by his client&mdash;an artist in his most
honourable profession&mdash;he felt convinced that not for one
moment would his Lordship tolerate this, he would use no stronger
word than daring attempt to evade legitimate responsibility.</p>

<p>Taking the text of Soames' letters, he lightly touched on
'Boileau v. The Blasted Cement Company, Limited.' "It is doubtful,"
he said, "what that authority has decided; in any case I would
submit that it is just as much in my favour as in my friend's." He
then argued the 'nice point' closely. With all due deference he
submitted that Mr. Forsyte's expression nullified itself. His
client not being a rich man, the matter was a serious one for him;
he was a very talented architect, whose professional reputation was
undoubtedly somewhat at stake. He concluded with a perhaps too
personal appeal to the Judge, as a lover of the arts, to show
himself the protector of artists, from what was
occasionally&mdash;he said occasionally&mdash;the too iron hand of
capital. "What," he said, "will be the position of the artistic
professions, if men of property like this Mr. Forsyte refuse, and
are allowed to refuse, to carry out the obligations of the
commissions which they have given." He would now call his client,
in case he should at the last moment have found himself able to be
present.</p>

<p>The name Philip Baynes Bosinney was called three times by the
Ushers, and the sound of the calling echoed with strange melancholy
throughout the Court and Galleries.</p>

<p>The crying of this name, to which no answer was returned, had
upon James a curious effect: it was like calling for your lost dog
about the streets. And the creepy feeling that it gave him, of a
man missing, grated on his sense of comfort and security-on his
cosiness. Though he could not have said why, it made him feel
uneasy.</p>

<p>He looked now at the clock&mdash;a quarter to three! It would be
all over in a quarter of an hour. Where could the young fellow
be?</p>

<p>It was only when Mr. Justice Bentham delivered judgment that he
got over the turn he had received.</p>

<p>Behind the wooden erection, by which he was fenced from more
ordinary mortals, the learned Judge leaned forward. The electric
light, just turned on above his head, fell on his face, and
mellowed it to an orange hue beneath the snowy crown of his wig;
the amplitude of his robes grew before the eye; his whole figure,
facing the comparative dusk of the Court, radiated like some
majestic and sacred body. He cleared his throat, took a sip of
water, broke the nib of a quill against the desk, and, folding his
bony hands before him, began.</p>

<p>To James he suddenly loomed much larger than he had ever thought
Bentham would loom. It was the majesty of the law; and a person
endowed with a nature far less matter-of-fact than that of James
might have been excused for failing to pierce this halo, and
disinter therefrom the somewhat ordinary Forsyte, who walked and
talked in every-day life under the name of Sir Walter Bentham.</p>

<p>He delivered judgment in the following words:</p>

<p>"The facts in this case are not in dispute. On May 15 last the
defendant wrote to the plaintiff, requesting to be allowed to
withdraw from his professional position in regard to the decoration
of the plaintiff's house, unless he were given 'a free hand.' The
plaintiff, on May 17, wrote back as follows: 'In giving you, in
accordance with your request, this free hand, I wish you to clearly
understand that the total cost of the house as handed over to me
completely decorated, inclusive of your fee (as arranged between
us) must not exceed twelve thousand pounds.' To this letter the
defendant replied on May 18: 'If you think that in such a delicate
matter as decoration I can bind myself to the exact pound, I am
afraid you are mistaken.' On May 19 the plaintiff wrote as follows:
'I did not mean to say that if you should exceed the sum named in
my letter to you by ten or twenty or even fifty pounds there would
be any difficulty between us. You have a free hand in the terms of
this correspondence, and I hope you will see your way to completing
the decorations.' On May 20 the defendant replied thus shortly:
'Very well.'</p>

<p>"In completing these decorations, the defendant incurred
liabilities and expenses which brought the total cost of this house
up to the sum of twelve thousand four hundred pounds, all of which
expenditure has been defrayed by the plaintiff. This action has
been brought by the plaintiff to recover from the defendant the sum
of three hundred and fifty pounds expended by him in excess of a
sum of twelve thousand and fifty pounds, alleged by the plaintiff
to have been fixed by this correspondence as the maximum sum that
the defendant had authority to expend.</p>

<p>"The question for me to decide is whether or no the defendant is
liable to refund to the plaintiff this sum. In my judgment he is so
liable.</p>

<p>"What in effect the plaintiff has said is this 'I give you a
free hand to complete these decorations, provided that you keep
within a total cost to me of twelve thousand pounds. If you exceed
that sum by as much as fifty pounds, I will not hold you
responsible; beyond that point you are no agent of mine, and I
shall repudiate liability.' It is not quite clear to me whether,
had the plaintiff in fact repudiated liability under his agent's
contracts, he would, under all the circumstances, have been
successful in so doing; but he has not adopted this course. He has
accepted liability, and fallen back upon his rights against the
defendant under the terms of the latter's engagement.</p>

<p>"In my judgment the plaintiff is entitled to recover this sum
from the defendant.</p>

<p>"It has been sought, on behalf of the defendant, to show that no
limit of expenditure was fixed or intended to be fixed by this
correspondence. If this were so, I can find no reason for the
plaintiff's importation into the correspondence of the figures of
twelve thousand pounds and subsequently of fifty pounds. The
defendant's contention would render these figures meaningless. It
is manifest to me that by his letter of May 20 he assented to a
very clear proposition, by the terms of which he must be held to be
bound.</p>

<p>"For these reasons there will be judgment for the plaintiff for
the amount claimed with costs."</p>

<p>James sighed, and stooping, picked up his umbrella which had
fallen with a rattle at the words 'importation into this
correspondence.'</p>

<p>Untangling his legs, he rapidly left the Court; without waiting
for his son, he snapped up a hansom cab (it was a clear, grey
afternoon) and drove straight to Timothy's where he found Swithin;
and to him, Mrs. Septimus Small, and Aunt Hester, he recounted the
whole proceedings, eating two muffins not altogether in the
intervals of speech.</p>

<p>"Soames did very well," he ended; "he's got his head screwed on
the right way. This won't please Jolyon. It's a bad business for
that young Bosinney; he'll go bankrupt, I shouldn't wonder," and
then after a long pause, during which he had stared disquietly into
the fire, he added:</p>

<p>"He wasn't there&mdash;now why?"</p>

<p>There was a sound of footsteps. The figure of a thick-set man,
with the ruddy brown face of robust health, was seen in the back
drawing-room. The forefinger of his upraised hand was outlined
against the black of his frock coat. He spoke in a grudging
voice.</p>

<p>"Well, James," he said, "I can't&mdash;I can't stop," and
turning round, he walked out.</p>

<p>It was Timothy.</p>

<p>James rose from his chair. "There!" he said, "there! I knew
there was something wro..." He checked himself, and was silent,
staring before him, as though he had seen a portent.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER VI&mdash;SOAMES BREAKS THE NEWS</h3>

<p>In leaving the Court Soames did not go straight home. He felt
disinclined for the City, and drawn by need for sympathy in his
triumph, he, too, made his way, but slowly and on foot, to
Timothy's in the Bayswater Road.</p>

<p>His father had just left; Mrs. Small and Aunt Hester, in
possession of the whole story, greeted him warmly. They were sure
he was hungry after all that evidence. Smither should toast him
some more muffins, his dear father had eaten them all. He must put
his legs up on the sofa; and he must have a glass of prune brandy
too. It was so strengthening.</p>

<p>Swithin was still present, having lingered later than his wont,
for he felt in want of exercise. On hearing this suggestion, he
'pished.' A pretty pass young men were coming to! His own liver was
out of order, and he could not bear the thought of anyone else
drinking prune brandy.</p>

<p>He went away almost immediately, saying to Soames: "And how's
your wife? You tell her from me that if she's dull, and likes to
come and dine with me quietly, I'll give her such a bottle of
champagne as she doesn't get every day." Staring down from his
height on Soames he contracted his thick, puffy, yellow hand as
though squeezing within it all this small fry, and throwing out his
chest he waddled slowly away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Small and Aunt Hester were left horrified. Swithin was so
droll!</p>

<p>They themselves were longing to ask Soames how Irene would take
the result, yet knew that they must not; he would perhaps say
something of his own accord, to throw some light on this, the
present burning question in their lives, the question that from
necessity of silence tortured them almost beyond bearing; for even
Timothy had now been told, and the effect on his health was little
short of alarming. And what, too, would June do? This, also, was a
most exciting, if dangerous speculation!</p>

<p>They had never forgotten old Jolyon's visit, since when he had
not once been to see them; they had never forgotten the feeling it
gave all who were present, that the family was no longer what it
had been&mdash;that the family was breaking up.</p>

<p>But Soames gave them no help, sitting with his knees crossed,
talking of the Barbizon school of painters, whom he had just
discovered. These were the coming men, he said; he should not
wonder if a lot of money were made over them; he had his eye on two
pictures by a man called Corot, charming things; if he could get
them at a reasonable price he was going to buy them&mdash;they
would, he thought, fetch a big price some day.</p>

<p>Interested as they could not but be, neither Mrs. Septimus Small
nor Aunt Hester could entirely acquiesce in being thus put off.</p>

<p>It was interesting&mdash;most interesting&mdash;and then Soames
was so clever that they were sure he would do something with those
pictures if anybody could; but what was his plan now that he had
won his case; was he going to leave London at once, and live in the
country, or what was he going to do?</p>

<p>Soames answered that he did not know, he thought they should be
moving soon. He rose and kissed his aunts.</p>

<p>No sooner had Aunt Juley received this emblem of departure than
a change came over her, as though she were being visited by
dreadful courage; every little roll of flesh on her face seemed
trying to escape from an invisible, confining mask.</p>

<p>She rose to the full extent of her more than medium height, and
said: "It has been on my mind a long time, dear, and if nobody else
will tell you, I have made up my mind that..."</p>

<p>Aunt Hester interrupted her: "Mind, Julia, you do it..." she
gasped&mdash;"on your own responsibility!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Small went on as though she had not heard: "I think you
ought to know, dear, that Mrs. MacAnder saw Irene walking in
Richmond Park with Mr. Bosinney."</p>

<p>Aunt Hester, who had also risen, sank back in her chair, and
turned her face away. Really Juley was too&mdash;she should not do
such things when she&mdash;Aunt Hester, was in the room; and,
breathless with anticipation, she waited for what Soames would
answer.</p>

<p>He had flushed the peculiar flush which always centred between
his eyes; lifting his hand, and, as it were, selecting a finger, he
bit a nail delicately; then, drawling it out between set lips, he
said: "Mrs. MacAnder is a cat!"</p>

<p>Without waiting for any reply, he left the room.</p>

<p>When he went into Timothy's he had made up his mind what course
to pursue on getting home. He would go up to Irene and say:</p>

<p>"Well, I've won my case, and there's an end of it! I don't want
to be hard on Bosinney; I'll see if we can't come to some
arrangement; he shan't be pressed. And now let's turn over a new
leaf! We'll let the house, and get out of these fogs. We'll go down
to Robin Hill at once. I&mdash;I never meant to be rough with you!
Let's shake hands&mdash;and&mdash;" Perhaps she would let him kiss
her, and forget!</p>

<p>When he came out of Timothy's his intentions were no longer so
simple. The smouldering jealousy and suspicion of months blazed up
within him. He would put an end to that sort of thing once and for
all; he would not have her drag his name in the dirt! If she could
not or would not love him, as was her duty and his right&mdash;she
should not play him tricks with anyone else! He would tax her with
it; threaten to divorce her! That would make her behave; she would
never face that. But&mdash;but&mdash;what if she did? He was
staggered; this had not occurred to him.</p>

<p>What if she did? What if she made him a confession? How would he
stand then? He would have to bring a divorce!</p>

<p>A divorce! Thus close, the word was paralyzing, so utterly at
variance with all the principles that had hitherto guided his life.
Its lack of compromise appalled him; he felt&mdash;like the captain
of a ship, going to the side of his vessel, and, with his own hands
throwing over the most precious of his bales. This jettisoning of
his property with his own hand seemed uncanny to Soames. It would
injure him in his profession: He would have to get rid of the house
at Robin Hill, on which he had spent so much money, so much
anticipation&mdash;and at a sacrifice. And she! She would no longer
belong to him, not even in name! She would pass out of his life,
and he&mdash;he should never see her again!</p>

<p>He traversed in the cab the length of a street without getting
beyond the thought that he should never see her again!</p>

<p>But perhaps there was nothing to confess, even now very likely
there was nothing to confess. Was it wise to push things so far?
Was it wise to put himself into a position where he might have to
eat his words? The result of this case would ruin Bosinney; a
ruined man was desperate, but&mdash;what could he do? He might go
abroad, ruined men always went abroad. What could they do&mdash;if
indeed it was 'they'&mdash;without money? It would be better to
wait and see how things turned out. If necessary, he could have her
watched. The agony of his jealousy (for all the world like the
crisis of an aching tooth) came on again; and he almost cried out.
But he must decide, fix on some course of action before he got
home. When the cab drew up at the door, he had decided nothing.</p>

<p>He entered, pale, his hands moist with perspiration, dreading to
meet her, burning to meet her, ignorant of what he was to say or
do.</p>

<p>The maid Bilson was in the hall, and in answer to his question:
"Where is your mistress?" told him that Mrs. Forsyte had left the
house about noon, taking with her a trunk and bag.</p>

<p>Snatching the sleeve of his fur coat away from her grasp, he
confronted her:</p>

<p>"What?" he exclaimed; "what's that you said?" Suddenly
recollecting that he must not betray emotion, he added: "What
message did she leave?" and noticed with secret terror the startled
look of the maid's eyes.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Forsyte left no message, sir."</p>

<p>"No message; very well, thank you, that will do. I shall be
dining out."</p>

<p>The maid went downstairs, leaving him still in his fur coat,
idly turning over the visiting cards in the porcelain bowl that
stood on the carved oak rug chest in the hall.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bareham Culcher. Mrs. Septimus Small. Mrs. Baynes.
Mr. Solomon Thornworthy. Lady Bellis. Miss Hermione Bellis. Miss
Winifred Bellis. Miss Ella Bellis.</p>

<p>Who the devil were all these people? He seemed to have forgotten
all familiar things. The words 'no message&mdash;a trunk, and a
bag,' played a hide-and-seek in his brain. It was incredible that
she had left no message, and, still in his fur coat, he ran
upstairs two steps at a time, as a young married man when he comes
home will run up to his wife's room.</p>

<p>Everything was dainty, fresh, sweet-smelling; everything in
perfect order. On the great bed with its lilac silk quilt, was the
bag she had made and embroidered with her own hands to hold her
sleeping things; her slippers ready at the foot; the sheets even
turned over at the head as though expecting her.</p>

<p>On the table stood the silver-mounted brushes and bottles from
her dressing bag, his own present. There must, then, be some
mistake. What bag had she taken? He went to the bell to summon
Bilson, but remembered in time that he must assume knowledge of
where Irene had gone, take it all as a matter of course, and grope
out the meaning for himself.</p>

<p>He locked the doors, and tried to think, but felt his brain
going round; and suddenly tears forced themselves into his
eyes.</p>

<p>Hurriedly pulling off his coat, he looked at himself in the
mirror.</p>

<p>He was too pale, a greyish tinge all over his face; he poured
out water, and began feverishly washing.</p>

<p>Her silver-mounted brushes smelt faintly of the perfumed lotion
she used for her hair; and at this scent the burning sickness of
his jealousy seized him again.</p>

<p>Struggling into his fur, he ran downstairs and out into the
street.</p>

<p>He had not lost all command of himself, however, and as he went
down Sloane Street he framed a story for use, in case he should not
find her at Bosinney's. But if he should? His power of decision
again failed; he reached the house without knowing what he should
do if he did find her there.</p>

<p>It was after office hours, and the street door was closed; the
woman who opened it could not say whether Mr. Bosinney were in or
no; she had not seen him that day, not for two or three days; she
did not attend to him now, nobody attended to him, he...</p>

<p>Soames interrupted her, he would go up and see for himself. He
went up with a dogged, white face.</p>

<p>The top floor was unlighted, the door closed, no one answered
his ringing, he could hear no sound. He was obliged to descend,
shivering under his fur, a chill at his heart. Hailing a cab, he
told the man to drive to Park Lane.</p>

<p>On the way he tried to recollect when he had last given her a
cheque; she could not have more than three or four pounds, but
there were her jewels; and with exquisite torture he remembered how
much money she could raise on these; enough to take them abroad;
enough for them to live on for months! He tried to calculate; the
cab stopped, and he got out with the calculation unmade.</p>

<p>The butler asked whether Mrs. Soames was in the cab, the master
had told him they were both expected to dinner.</p>

<p>Soames answered: "No. Mrs. Forsyte has a cold."</p>

<p>The butler was sorry.</p>

<p>Soames thought he was looking at him inquisitively, and
remembering that he was not in dress clothes, asked: "Anybody here
to dinner, Warmson?"</p>

<p>"Nobody but Mr. and Mrs. Dartie, sir."</p>

<p>Again it seemed to Soames that the butler was looking curiously
at him. His composure gave way.</p>

<p>"What are you looking at?" he said. "What's the matter with me,
eh?"</p>

<p>The butler blushed, hung up the fur coat, murmured something
that sounded like: "Nothing, sir, I'm sure, sir," and stealthily
withdrew.</p>

<p>Soames walked upstairs. Passing the drawing-room without a look,
he went straight up to his mother's and father's bedroom.</p>

<p>James, standing sideways, the concave lines of his tall, lean
figure displayed to advantage in shirt-sleeves and evening
waistcoat, his head bent, the end of his white tie peeping askew
from underneath one white Dundreary whisker, his eyes peering with
intense concentration, his lips pouting, was hooking the top hooks
of his wife's bodice. Soames stopped; he felt half-choked, whether
because he had come upstairs too fast, or for some other reason.
He&mdash;he himself had never&mdash;never been asked to...</p>

<p>He heard his father's voice, as though there were a pin in his
mouth, saying: "Who's that? Who's there? What d'you want?" His
mother's: "Here, Felice, come and hook this; your master'll never
get done."</p>

<p>He put his hand up to his throat, and said hoarsely:</p>

<p>"It's I&mdash;Soames!"</p>

<p>He noticed gratefully the affectionate surprise in Emily's:
"Well, my dear boy?" and James', as he dropped the hook: "What,
Soames! What's brought you up? Aren't you well?"</p>

<p>He answered mechanically: "I'm all right," and looked at them,
and it seemed impossible to bring out his news.</p>

<p>James, quick to take alarm, began: "You don't look well. I
expect you've taken a chill&mdash;it's liver, I shouldn't wonder.
Your mother'll give you..."</p>

<p>But Emily broke in quietly: "Have you brought Irene?"</p>

<p>Soames shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he stammered, "she&mdash;she's left me!"</p>

<p>Emily deserted the mirror before which she was standing. Her
tall, full figure lost its majesty and became very human as she
came running over to Soames.</p>

<p>"My dear boy! My dear boy!"</p>

<p>She put her lips to his forehead, and stroked his hand.</p>

<p>James, too, had turned full towards his son; his face looked
older.</p>

<p>"Left you?" he said. "What d'you mean&mdash;left you? You never
told me she was going to leave you."</p>

<p>Soames answered surlily: "How could I tell? What's to be
done?"</p>

<p>James began walking up and down; he looked strange and
stork-like without a coat. "What's to be done!" he muttered. "How
should I know what's to be done? What's the good of asking me?
Nobody tells me anything, and then they come and ask me what's to
be done; and I should like to know how I'm to tell them! Here's
your mother, there she stands; she doesn't say anything. What I
should say you've got to do is to follow her.."</p>

<p>Soames smiled; his peculiar, supercilious smile had never before
looked pitiable.</p>

<p>"I don't know where she's gone," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't know where she's gone!" said James. "How d'you mean,
don't know where she's gone? Where d'you suppose she's gone? She's
gone after that young Bosinney, that's where she's gone. I knew how
it would be."</p>

<p>Soames, in the long silence that followed, felt his mother
pressing his hand. And all that passed seemed to pass as though his
own power of thinking or doing had gone to sleep.</p>

<p>His father's face, dusky red, twitching as if he were going to
cry, and words breaking out that seemed rent from him by some spasm
in his soul.</p>

<p>"There'll be a scandal; I always said so." Then, no one saying
anything: "And there you stand, you and your mother!"</p>

<p>And Emily's voice, calm, rather contemptuous: "Come, now, James!
Soames will do all that he can."</p>

<p>And James, staring at the floor, a little brokenly: "Well, I
can't help you; I'm getting old. Don't you be in too great a hurry,
my boy."</p>

<p>And his mother's voice again: "Soames will do all he can to get
her back. We won't talk of it. It'll all come right, I dare
say."</p>

<p>And James: "Well, I can't see how it can come right. And if she
hasn't gone off with that young Bosinney, my advice to you is not
to listen to her, but to follow her and get her back."</p>

<p>Once more Soames felt his mother stroking his hand, in token of
her approval, and as though repeating some form of sacred oath, he
muttered between his teeth: "I will!"</p>

<p>All three went down to the drawing-room together. There, were
gathered the three girls and Dartie; had Irene been present, the
family circle would have been complete.</p>

<p>James sank into his armchair, and except for a word of cold
greeting to Dartie, whom he both despised and dreaded, as a man
likely to be always in want of money, he said nothing till dinner
was announced. Soames, too, was silent; Emily alone, a woman of
cool courage, maintained a conversation with Winifred on trivial
subjects. She was never more composed in her manner and
conversation than that evening.</p>

<p>A decision having been come to not to speak of Irene's flight,
no view was expressed by any other member of the family as to the
right course to be pursued; there can be little doubt, from the
general tone adopted in relation to events as they afterwards
turned out, that James's advice: "Don't you listen to her,
follow-her and get her back!" would, with here and there an
exception, have been regarded as sound, not only in Park Lane, but
amongst the Nicholases, the Rogers, and at Timothy's. Just as it
would surely have been endorsed by that wider body of Forsytes all
over London, who were merely excluded from judgment by ignorance of
the story.</p>

<p>In spite then of Emily's efforts, the dinner was served by
Warmson and the footman almost in silence. Dartie was sulky, and
drank all he could get; the girls seldom talked to each other at
any time. James asked once where June was, and what she was doing
with herself in these days. No one could tell him. He sank back
into gloom. Only when Winifred recounted how little Publius had
given his bad penny to a beggar, did he brighten up.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "that's a clever little chap. I don't know
what'll become of him, if he goes on like this. An intelligent
little chap, I call him!" But it was only a flash.</p>

<p>The courses succeeded one another solemnly, under the electric
light, which glared down onto the table, but barely reached the
principal ornament of the walls, a so-called 'Sea Piece by Turner,'
almost entirely composed of cordage and drowning men.</p>

<p>Champagne was handed, and then a bottle of James' prehistoric
port, but as by the chill hand of some skeleton.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock Soames left; twice in reply to questions, he had
said that Irene was not well; he felt he could no longer trust
himself. His mother kissed him with her large soft kiss, and he
pressed her hand, a flush of warmth in his cheeks. He walked away
in the cold wind, which whistled desolately round the corners of
the streets, under a sky of clear steel-blue, alive with stars; he
noticed neither their frosty greeting, nor the crackle of the
curled-up plane-leaves, nor the night-women hurrying in their
shabby furs, nor the pinched faces of vagabonds at street corners.
Winter was come! But Soames hastened home, oblivious; his hands
trembled as he took the late letters from the gilt wire cage into
which they had been thrust through the slit in the door.'</p>

<p>None from Irene!</p>

<p>He went into the dining-room; the fire was bright there, his
chair drawn up to it, slippers ready, spirit case, and carven
cigarette box on the table; but after staring at it all for a
minute or two, he turned out the light and went upstairs. There was
a fire too in his dressing-room, but her room was dark and cold. It
was into this room that Soames went.</p>

<p>He made a great illumination with candles, and for a long time
continued pacing up and down between the bed and the door. He could
not get used to the thought that she had really left him, and as
though still searching for some message, some reason, some reading
of all the mystery of his married life, he began opening every
recess and drawer.</p>

<p>There were her dresses; he had always liked, indeed insisted,
that she should be well-dressed&mdash;she had taken very few; two
or three at most, and drawer after drawer; full of linen and silk
things, was untouched.</p>

<p>Perhaps after all it was only a freak, and she had gone to the
seaside for a few days' change. If only that were so, and she were
really coming back, he would never again do as he had done that
fatal night before last, never again run that risk&mdash;though it
was her duty, her duty as a wife; though she did belong to
him&mdash;he would never again run that risk; she was evidently not
quite right in her head!</p>

<p>He stooped over the drawer where she kept her jewels; it was not
locked, and came open as he pulled; the jewel box had the key in
it. This surprised him until he remembered that it was sure to be
empty. He opened it.</p>

<p>It was far from empty. Divided, in little green velvet
compartments, were all the things he had given her, even her watch,
and stuck into the recess that contained&mdash;the watch was a
three-cornered note addressed 'Soames Forsyte,' in Irene's
handwriting:</p>

<p>'I think I have taken nothing that you or your people have given
me.' And that was all.</p>

<p>He looked at the clasps and bracelets of diamonds and pearls, at
the little flat gold watch with a great diamond set in sapphires,
at the chains and rings, each in its nest, and the tears rushed up
in his eyes and dropped upon them.</p>

<p>Nothing that she could have done, nothing that she had done,
brought home to him like this the inner significance of her act.
For the moment, perhaps, he understood nearly all there was to
understand&mdash;understood that she loathed him, that she had
loathed him for years, that for all intents and purposes they were
like people living in different worlds, that there was no hope for
him, never had been; even, that she had suffered&mdash;that she was
to be pitied.</p>

<p>In that moment of emotion he betrayed the Forsyte in
him&mdash;forgot himself, his interests, his property&mdash;was
capable of almost anything; was lifted into the pure ether of the
selfless and unpractical.</p>

<p>Such moments pass quickly.</p>

<p>And as though with the tears he had purged himself of weakness,
he got up, locked the box, and slowly, almost trembling, carried it
with him into the other room.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER VII&mdash;JUNE'S VICTORY</h3>

<p>June had waited for her chance, scanning the duller columns of
the journals, morning and evening with an assiduity which at first
puzzled old Jolyon; and when her chance came, she took it with all
the promptitude and resolute tenacity of her character.</p>

<p>She will always remember best in her life that morning when at
last she saw amongst the reliable Cause List of the Times
newspaper, under the heading of Court XIII, Mr. Justice Bentham,
the case of Forsyte v. Bosinney.</p>

<p>Like a gambler who stakes his last piece of money, she had
prepared to hazard her all upon this throw; it was not her nature
to contemplate defeat. How, unless with the instinct of a woman in
love, she knew that Bosinney's discomfiture in this action was
assured, cannot be told&mdash;on this assumption, however, she laid
her plans, as upon a certainty.</p>

<p>Half past eleven found her at watch in the gallery of Court
XIII., and there she remained till the case of Forsyte v. Bosinney
was over. Bosinney's absence did not disquiet her; she had felt
instinctively that he would not defend himself. At the end of the
judgment she hastened down, and took a cab to his rooms.</p>

<p>She passed the open street-door and the offices on the three
lower floors without attracting notice; not till she reached the
top did her difficulties begin.</p>

<p>Her ring was not answered; she had now to make up her mind
whether she would go down and ask the caretaker in the basement to
let her in to await Mr. Bosinney's return, or remain patiently
outside the door, trusting that no one would, come up. She decided
on the latter course.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour had passed in freezing vigil on the
landing, before it occurred to her that Bosinney had been used to
leave the key of his rooms under the door-mat. She looked and found
it there. For some minutes she could not decide to make use of it;
at last she let herself in and left the door open that anyone who
came might see she was there on business.</p>

<p>This was not the same June who had paid the trembling visit five
months ago; those months of suffering and restraint had made her
less sensitive; she had dwelt on this visit so long, with such
minuteness, that its terrors were discounted beforehand. She was
not there to fail this time, for if she failed no one could help
her.</p>

<p>Like some mother beast on the watch over her young, her little
quick figure never stood still in that room, but wandered from wall
to wall, from window to door, fingering now one thing, now another.
There was dust everywhere, the room could not have been cleaned for
weeks, and June, quick to catch at anything that should buoy up her
hope, saw in it a sign that he had been obliged, for economy's
sake, to give up his servant.</p>

<p>She looked into the bedroom; the bed was roughly made, as though
by the hand of man. Listening intently, she darted in, and peered
into his cupboards. A few shirts and collars, a pair of muddy
boots&mdash;the room was bare even of garments.</p>

<p>She stole back to the sitting-room, and now she noticed the
absence of all the little things he had set store by. The clock
that had been his mother's, the field-glasses that had hung over
the sofa; two really valuable old prints of Harrow, where his
father had been at school, and last, not least, the piece of
Japanese pottery she herself had given him. All were gone; and in
spite of the rage roused within her championing soul at the thought
that the world should treat him thus, their disappearance augured
happily for the success of her plan.</p>

<p>It was while looking at the spot where the piece of Japanese
pottery had stood that she felt a strange certainty of being
watched, and, turning, saw Irene in the open doorway.</p>

<p>The two stood gazing at each other for a minute in silence; then
June walked forward and held out her hand. Irene did not take
it.</p>

<p>When her hand was refused, June put it behind her. Her eyes grew
steady with anger; she waited for Irene to speak; and thus waiting,
took in, with who-knows-what rage of jealousy, suspicion, and
curiosity, every detail of her friend's face and dress and
figure.</p>

<p>Irene was clothed in her long grey fur; the travelling cap on
her head left a wave of gold hair visible above her forehead. The
soft fullness of the coat made her face as small as a child's.</p>

<p>Unlike June's cheeks, her cheeks had no colour in them, but were
ivory white and pinched as if with cold. Dark circles lay round her
eyes. In one hand she held a bunch of violets.</p>

<p>She looked back at June, no smile on her lips; and with those
great dark eyes fastened on her, the girl, for all her startled
anger, felt something of the old spell.</p>

<p>She spoke first, after all.</p>

<p>"What have you come for?" But the feeling that she herself was
being asked the same question, made her add: "This horrible case. I
came to tell him&mdash;he has lost it."</p>

<p>Irene did not speak, her eyes never moved from June's face, and
the girl cried:</p>

<p>"Don't stand there as if you were made of stone!"</p>

<p>Irene laughed: "I wish to God I were!"</p>

<p>But June turned away: "Stop!" she cried, "don't tell me! I don't
want to hear! I don't want to hear what you've come for. I don't
want to hear!" And like some uneasy spirit, she began swiftly
walking to and fro. Suddenly she broke out:</p>

<p>"I was here first. We can't both stay here together!"</p>

<p>On Irene's face a smile wandered up, and died out like a flicker
of firelight. She did not move. And then it was that June perceived
under the softness and immobility of this figure something
desperate and resolved; something not to be turned away, something
dangerous. She tore off her hat, and, putting both hands to her
brow, pressed back the bronze mass of her hair.</p>

<p>"You have no right here!" she cried defiantly.</p>

<p>Irene answered: "I have no right anywhere!</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I have left Soames. You always wanted me to!"</p>

<p>June put her hands over her ears.</p>

<p>"Don't! I don't want to hear anything&mdash;I don't want to know
anything. It's impossible to fight with you! What makes you stand
like that? Why don't you go?"</p>

<p>Irene's lips moved; she seemed to be saying: "Where should I
go?"</p>

<p>June turned to the window. She could see the face of a clock
down in the street. It was nearly four. At any moment he might
come! She looked back across her shoulder, and her face was
distorted with anger.</p>

<p>But Irene had not moved; in her gloved hands she ceaselessly
turned and twisted the little bunch of violets.</p>

<p>The tears of rage and disappointment rolled down June's
cheeks.</p>

<p>"How could you come?" she said. "You have been a false friend to
me!"</p>

<p>Again Irene laughed. June saw that she had played a wrong card,
and broke down.</p>

<p>"Why have you come?" she sobbed. "You've ruined my life, and now
you want to ruin his!"</p>

<p>Irene's mouth quivered; her eyes met June's with a look so
mournful that the girl cried out in the midst of her sobbing, "No,
no!"</p>

<p>But Irene's head bent till it touched her breast. She turned,
and went quickly out, hiding her lips with the little bunch of
violets.</p>

<p>June ran to the door. She heard the footsteps going down and
down. She called out: "Come back, Irene! Come back!"</p>

<p>The footsteps died away...</p>

<p>Bewildered and torn, the girl stood at the top of the stairs.
Why had Irene gone, leaving her mistress of the field? What did it
mean? Had she really given him up to her? Or had she...? And she
was the prey of a gnawing uncertainty...Bosinney did not
come...</p>

<p>About six o'clock that afternoon old Jolyon returned from
Wistaria Avenue, where now almost every day he spent some hours,
and asked if his grand-daughter were upstairs. On being told that
she had just come in, he sent up to her room to request her to come
down and speak to him.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind to tell her that he was reconciled with
her father. In future bygones must be bygones. He would no longer
live alone, or practically alone, in this great house; he was going
to give it up, and take one in the country for his son, where they
could all go and live together. If June did not like this, she
could have an allowance and live by herself. It wouldn't make much
difference to her, for it was a long time since she had shown him
any affection.</p>

<p>But when June came down, her face was pinched and piteous; there
was a strained, pathetic look in her eyes. She snuggled up in her
old attitude on the arm of his chair, and what he said compared but
poorly with the clear, authoritative, injured statement he had
thought out with much care. His heart felt sore, as the great heart
of a mother-bird feels sore when its youngling flies and bruises
its wing. His words halted, as though he were apologizing for
having at last deviated from the path of virtue, and succumbed, in
defiance of sounder principles, to his more natural instincts.</p>

<p>He seemed nervous lest, in thus announcing his intentions, he
should be setting his granddaughter a bad example; and now that he
came to the point, his way of putting the suggestion that, if she
didn't like it, she could live by herself and lump it, was delicate
in the extreme.'</p>

<p>"And if, by any chance, my darling," he said, "you found you
didn't get on&mdash;with them, why, I could make that all right.
You could have what you liked. We could find a little flat in
London where you could set up, and I could be running to
continually. But the children," he added, "are dear little
things!"</p>

<p>Then, in the midst of this grave, rather transparent,
explanation of changed policy, his eyes twinkled. "This'll astonish
Timothy's weak nerves. That precious young thing will have
something to say about this, or I'm a Dutchman!"</p>

<p>June had not yet spoken. Perched thus on the arm of his chair,
with her head above him, her face was invisible. But presently he
felt her warm cheek against his own, and knew that, at all events,
there was nothing very alarming in her attitude towards his news.
He began to take courage.</p>

<p>"You'll like your father," he said&mdash;"an amiable chap. Never
was much push about him, but easy to get on with. You'll find him
artistic and all that."</p>

<p>And old Jolyon bethought him of the dozen or so water-colour
drawings all carefully locked up in his bedroom; for now that his
son was going to become a man of property he did not think them
quite such poor things as heretofore.</p>

<p>"As to your&mdash;your stepmother," he said, using the word with
some little difficulty, "I call her a refined woman&mdash;a bit of
a Mrs. Gummidge, I shouldn't wonder&mdash;but very fond of Jo. And
the children," he repeated&mdash;indeed, this sentence ran like
music through all his solemn self-justification&mdash;"are sweet
little things!"</p>

<p>If June had known, those words but reincarnated that tender love
for little children, for the young and weak, which in the past had
made him desert his son for her tiny self, and now, as the cycle
rolled, was taking him from her.</p>

<p>But he began to get alarmed at her silence, and asked
impatiently: "Well, what do you say?"</p>

<p>June slid down to his knee, and she in her turn began her tale.
She thought it would all go splendidly; she did not see any
difficulty, and she did not care a bit what people thought.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon wriggled. H'm! then people would think! He had
thought that after all these years perhaps they wouldn't! Well, he
couldn't help it! Nevertheless, he could not approve of his
granddaughter's way of putting it&mdash;she ought to mind what
people thought!</p>

<p>Yet he said nothing. His feelings were too mixed, too
inconsistent for expression.</p>

<p>No&mdash;went on June he did not care; what business was it of
theirs? There was only one thing&mdash;and with her cheek pressing
against his knee, old Jolyon knew at once that this something was
no trifle: As he was going to buy a house in the country, would he
not&mdash;to please her&mdash;buy that splendid house of Soames' at
Robin Hill? It was finished, it was perfectly beautiful, and no one
would live in it now. They would all be so happy there.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon was on the alert at once. Wasn't the 'man of
property' going to live in his new house, then? He never alluded to
Soames now but under this title.</p>

<p>"No"&mdash;June said&mdash;"he was not; she knew that he was
not!"</p>

<p>How did she know?</p>

<p>She could not tell him, but she knew. She knew nearly for
certain! It was most unlikely; circumstances had changed! Irene's
words still rang in her head: "I have left Soames. Where should I
go?"</p>

<p>But she kept silence about that.</p>

<p>If her grandfather would only buy it and settle that wretched
claim that ought never to have been made on Phil! It would be the
very best thing for everybody, and everything&mdash;everything
might come straight.</p>

<p>And June put her lips to his forehead, and pressed them
close.</p>

<p>But old Jolyon freed himself from her caress, his face wore the
judicial look which came upon it when he dealt with affairs. He
asked: What did she mean? There was something behind all
this&mdash;had she been seeing Bosinney?</p>

<p>June answered: "No; but I have been to his rooms."</p>

<p>"Been to his rooms? Who took you there?"</p>

<p>June faced him steadily. "I went alone. He has lost that case. I
don't care whether it was right or wrong. I want to help him; and I
will!"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon asked again: "Have you seen him?" His glance seemed
to pierce right through the girl's eyes into her soul.</p>

<p>Again June answered: "No; he was not there. I waited, but he did
not come."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon made a movement of relief. She had risen and looked
down at him; so slight, and light, and young, but so fixed, and so
determined; and disturbed, vexed, as he was, he could not frown
away that fixed look. The feeling of being beaten, of the reins
having slipped, of being old and tired, mastered him.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said at last, "you'll get yourself into a mess one of
these days, I can see. You want your own way in everything."</p>

<p>Visited by one of his strange bursts of philosophy, he added:
"Like that you were born; and like that you'll stay until you
die!"</p>

<p>And he, who in his dealings with men of business, with Boards,
with Forsytes of all descriptions, with such as were not Forsytes,
had always had his own way, looked at his indomitable grandchild
sadly&mdash;for he felt in her that quality which above all others
he unconsciously admired.</p>

<p>"Do you know what they say is going on?" he said slowly.</p>

<p>June crimsoned.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no! I know&mdash;and I don't know&mdash;I don't
care!" and she stamped her foot.</p>

<p>"I believe," said old Jolyon, dropping his eyes, "that you'd
have him if he were dead!"</p>

<p>There was a long silence before he spoke again.</p>

<p>"But as to buying this house&mdash;you don't know what you're
talking about!"</p>

<p>June said that she did. She knew that he could get it if he
wanted. He would only have to give what it cost.</p>

<p>"What it cost! You know nothing about it. I won't go to
Soames&mdash;I'll have nothing more to do with that young man."</p>

<p>"But you needn't; you can go to Uncle James. If you can't buy
the house, will you pay his lawsuit claim? I know he is terribly
hard up&mdash;I've seen it. You can stop it out of my money!"</p>

<p>A twinkle came into old Jolyon's eyes.</p>

<p>"Stop it out of your money! A pretty way. And what will you do,
pray, without your money?"</p>

<p>But secretly, the idea of wresting the house from James and his
son had begun to take hold of him. He had heard on Forsyte 'Change
much comment, much rather doubtful praise of this house. It was
'too artistic,' but a fine place. To take from the 'man of
property' that on which he had set his heart, would be a crowning
triumph over James, practical proof that he was going to make a man
of property of Jo, to put him back in his proper position, and
there to keep him secure. Justice once for all on those who had
chosen to regard his son as a poor, penniless outcast.</p>

<p>He would see, he would see! It might be out of the question; he
was not going to pay a fancy price, but if it could be done, why,
perhaps he would do it!</p>

<p>And still more secretly he knew that he could not refuse
her.</p>

<p>But he did not commit himself. He would think it over&mdash;he
said to June.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;BOSINNEY'S DEPARTURE</h3>

<p>Old Jolyon was not given to hasty decisions; it is probable that
he would have continued to think over the purchase of the house at
Robin Hill, had not June's face told him that he would have no
peace until he acted.</p>

<p>At breakfast next morning she asked him what time she should
order the carriage.</p>

<p>"Carriage!" he said, with some appearance of innocence; "what
for? I'm not going out!"</p>

<p>She answered: "If you don't go early, you won't catch Uncle
James before he goes into the City."</p>

<p>"James! what about your Uncle James?"</p>

<p>"The house," she replied, in such a voice that he no longer
pretended ignorance.</p>

<p>"I've not made up my mind," he said.</p>

<p>"You must! You must! Oh! Gran&mdash;think of me!"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon grumbled out: "Think of you&mdash;I'm always thinking
of you, but you don't think of yourself; you don't think what
you're letting yourself in for. Well, order the carriage at
ten!"</p>

<p>At a quarter past he was placing his umbrella in the stand at
Park Lane&mdash;he did not choose to relinquish his hat and coat;
telling Warmson that he wanted to see his master, he went, without
being announced, into the study, and sat down.</p>

<p>James was still in the dining-room talking to Soames, who had
come round again before breakfast. On hearing who his visitor was,
he muttered nervously: "Now, what's he want, I wonder?"</p>

<p>He then got up.</p>

<p>"Well," he said to Soames, "don't you go doing anything in a
hurry. The first thing is to find out where she is&mdash;I should
go to Stainer's about it; they're the best men, if they can't find
her, nobody can." And suddenly moved to strange softness, he
muttered to himself, "Poor little thing, I can't tell what she was
thinking about!" and went out blowing his nose.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon did not rise on seeing his brother, but held out his
hand, and exchanged with him the clasp of a Forsyte.</p>

<p>James took another chair by the table, and leaned his head on
his hand.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "how are you? We don't see much of you
nowadays!"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon paid no attention to the remark.</p>

<p>"How's Emily?" he asked; and waiting for no reply, went on "I've
come to see you about this affair of young Bosinney's. I'm told
that new house of his is a white elephant."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about a white elephant," said James, "I
know he's lost his case, and I should say he'll go bankrupt."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon was not slow to seize the opportunity this gave
him.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder a bit!" he agreed; "and if he goes bankrupt,
the 'man of property'&mdash;that is, Soames'll be out of pocket.
Now, what I was thinking was this: If he's not going to live
there..."</p>

<p>Seeing both surprise and suspicion in James' eye, he quickly
went on: "I don't want to know anything; I suppose Irene's put her
foot down&mdash;it's not material to me. But I'm thinking of a
house in the country myself, not too far from London, and if it
suited me I don't say that I mightn't look at it, at a price."</p>

<p>James listened to this statement with a strange mixture of
doubt, suspicion, and relief, merging into a dread of something
behind, and tinged with the remains of his old undoubted reliance
upon his elder brother's good faith and judgment. There was
anxiety, too, as to what old Jolyon could have heard and how he had
heard it; and a sort of hopefulness arising from the thought that
if June's connection with Bosinney were completely at an end, her
grandfather would hardly seem anxious to help the young fellow.
Altogether he was puzzled; as he did not like either to show this,
or to commit himself in any way, he said:</p>

<p>"They tell me you're altering your Will in favour of your
son."</p>

<p>He had not been told this; he had merely added the fact of
having seen old Jolyon with his son and grandchildren to the fact
that he had taken his Will away from Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte.
The shot went home.</p>

<p>"Who told you that?" asked old Jolyon.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," said James; "I can't remember
names&mdash;I know somebody told me Soames spent a lot of money on
this house; he's not likely to part with it except at a good
price."</p>

<p>"Well," said old Jolyon, "if, he thinks I'm going to pay a fancy
price, he's mistaken. I've not got the money to throw away that he
seems to have. Let him try and sell it at a forced sale, and see
what he'll get. It's not every man's house, I hear!"</p>

<p>James, who was secretly also of this opinion, answered: "It's a
gentleman's house. Soames is here now if you'd like to see
him."</p>

<p>"No," said old Jolyon, "I haven't got as far as that; and I'm
not likely to, I can see that very well if I'm met in this
manner!"</p>

<p>James was a little cowed; when it came to the actual figures of
a commercial transaction he was sure of himself, for then he was
dealing with facts, not with men; but preliminary negotiations such
as these made him nervous&mdash;he never knew quite how far he
could go.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I know nothing about it. Soames, he tells me
nothing; I should think he'd entertain it&mdash;it's a question of
price."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said old Jolyon, "don't let him make a favour of it!" He
placed his hat on his head in dudgeon.</p>

<p>The door was opened and Soames came in.</p>

<p>"There's a policeman out here," he said with his half smile,
"for Uncle Jolyon."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon looked at him angrily, and James said: "A policeman?
I don't know anything about a policeman. But I suppose you know
something about him," he added to old Jolyon with a look of
suspicion: "I suppose you'd better see him!"</p>

<p>In the hall an Inspector of Police stood stolidly regarding with
heavy-lidded pale-blue eyes the fine old English furniture picked
up by James at the famous Mavrojano sale in Portman Square. "You'll
find my brother in there," said James.</p>

<p>The Inspector raised his fingers respectfully to his peaked cap,
and entered the study.</p>

<p>James saw him go in with a strange sensation.</p>

<p>"Well," he said to Soames, "I suppose we must wait and see what
he wants. Your uncle's been here about the house!"</p>

<p>He returned with Soames into the dining-room, but could not
rest.</p>

<p>"Now what does he want?" he murmured again.</p>

<p>"Who?" replied Soames: "the Inspector? They sent him round from
Stanhope Gate, that's all I know. That 'nonconformist' of Uncle
Jolyon's has been pilfering, I shouldn't wonder!"</p>

<p>But in spite of his calmness, he too was ill at ease.</p>

<p>At the end of ten minutes old Jolyon came in. He walked up to
the table, and stood there perfectly silent pulling at his long
white moustaches. James gazed up at him with opening mouth; he had
never seen his brother look like this.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon raised his hand, and said slowly:</p>

<p>"Young Bosinney has been run over in the fog and killed."</p>

<p>Then standing above his brother and his nephew, and looking down
at him with his deep eyes:</p>

<p>"There's&mdash;some&mdash;talk&mdash;of&mdash;suicide," he
said.</p>

<p>James' jaw dropped. "Suicide! What should he do that for?"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon answered sternly: "God knows, if you and your son
don't!"</p>

<p>But James did not reply.</p>

<p>For all men of great age, even for all Forsytes, life has had
bitter experiences. The passer-by, who sees them wrapped in cloaks
of custom, wealth, and comfort, would never suspect that such black
shadows had fallen on their roads. To every man of great
age&mdash;to Sir Walter Bentham himself&mdash;the idea of suicide
has once at least been present in the ante-room of his soul; on the
threshold, waiting to enter, held out from the inmost chamber by
some chance reality, some vague fear, some painful hope. To
Forsytes that final renunciation of property is hard. Oh! it is
hard! Seldom&mdash;perhaps never&mdash;can they achieve, it; and
yet, how near have they not sometimes been!</p>

<p>So even with James! Then in the medley of his thoughts, he broke
out: "Why I saw it in the paper yesterday: 'Run over in the fog!'
They didn't know his name!" He turned from one face to the other in
his confusion of soul; but instinctively all the time he was
rejecting that rumour of suicide. He dared not entertain this
thought, so against his interest, against the interest of his son,
of every Forsyte. He strove against it; and as his nature ever
unconsciously rejected that which it could not with safety accept,
so gradually he overcame this fear. It was an accident! It must
have been!</p>

<p>Old Jolyon broke in on his reverie.</p>

<p>"Death was instantaneous. He lay all day yesterday at the
hospital. There was nothing to tell them who he was. I am going
there now; you and your son had better come too."</p>

<p>No one opposing this command he led the way from the room.</p>

<p>The day was still and clear and bright, and driving over to Park
Lane from Stanhope Gate, old Jolyon had had the carriage open.
Sitting back on the padded cushions, finishing his cigar, he had
noticed with pleasure the keen crispness of the air, the bustle of
the cabs and people; the strange, almost Parisian, alacrity that
the first fine day will bring into London streets after a spell of
fog or rain. And he had felt so happy; he had not felt like it for
months. His confession to June was off his mind; he had the
prospect of his son's, above all, of his grandchildren's company in
the future&mdash;(he had appointed to meet young Jolyon at the
Hotch Potch that very manning to&mdash;discuss it again); and there
was the pleasurable excitement of a coming encounter, a coming
victory, over James and the 'man of property' in the matter of the
house.</p>

<p>He had the carriage closed now; he had no heart to look on
gaiety; nor was it right that Forsytes should be seen driving with
an Inspector of Police.</p>

<p>In that carriage the Inspector spoke again of the death:</p>

<p>"It was not so very thick&mdash;Just there. The driver says the
gentleman must have had time to see what he was about, he seemed to
walk right into it. It appears that he was very hard up, we found
several pawn tickets at his rooms, his account at the bank is
overdrawn, and there's this case in to-day's papers;" his cold blue
eyes travelled from one to another of the three Forsytes in the
carriage.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon watching from his corner saw his brother's face
change, and the brooding, worried, look deepen on it. At the
Inspector's words, indeed, all James' doubts and fears revived.
Hard-up&mdash;pawn-tickets&mdash;an overdrawn account! These words
that had all his life been a far-off nightmare to him, seemed to
make uncannily real that suspicion of suicide which must on no
account be entertained. He sought his son's eye; but lynx-eyed,
taciturn, immovable, Soames gave no answering look. And to old
Jolyon watching, divining the league of mutual defence between
them, there came an overmastering desire to have his own son at his
side, as though this visit to the dead man's body was a battle in
which otherwise he must single-handed meet those two. And the
thought of how to keep June's name out of the business kept
whirring in his brain. James had his son to support him! Why should
he not send for Jo?</p>

<p>Taking out his card-case, he pencilled the following
message:</p>

<p>'Come round at once. I've sent the carriage for you.'</p>

<p>On getting out he gave this card to his coachman, telling him to
drive&mdash;as fast as possible to the Hotch Potch Club, and if Mr.
Jolyon Forsyte were there to give him the card and bring him at
once. If not there yet, he was to wait till he came.</p>

<p>He followed the others slowly up the steps, leaning on his
umbrella, and stood a moment to get his breath. The Inspector said:
"This is the mortuary, sir. But take your time."</p>

<p>In the bare, white-walled room, empty of all but a streak of
sunshine smeared along the dustless floor, lay a form covered by a
sheet. With a huge steady hand the Inspector took the hem and
turned it back. A sightless face gazed up at them, and on either
side of that sightless defiant face the three Forsytes gazed down;
in each one of them the secret emotions, fears, and pity of his own
nature rose and fell like the rising, falling waves of life, whose
wish those white walls barred out now for ever from Bosinney. And
in each one of them the trend of his nature, the odd essential
spring, which moved him in fashions minutely, unalterably different
from those of every other human being, forced him to a different
attitude of thought. Far from the others, yet inscrutably close,
each stood thus, alone with death, silent, his eyes lowered.</p>

<p>The Inspector asked softly:</p>

<p>"You identify the gentleman, sir?"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon raised his head and nodded. He looked at his brother
opposite, at that long lean figure brooding over the dead man, with
face dusky red, and strained grey eyes; and at the figure of Soames
white and still by his father's side. And all that he had felt
against those two was gone like smoke in the long white presence of
Death. Whence comes it, how comes it&mdash;Death? Sudden reverse of
all that goes before; blind setting forth on a path that leads to
where? Dark quenching of the fire! The heavy, brutal
crushing&mdash;out that all men must go through, keeping their eyes
clear and brave unto the end! Small and of no import, insects
though they are! And across old Jolyon's face there flitted a
gleam, for Soames, murmuring to the Inspector, crept noiselessly
away.</p>

<p>Then suddenly James raised his eyes. There was a queer appeal in
that suspicious troubled look: "I know I'm no match for you," it
seemed to say. And, hunting for handkerchief he wiped his brow;
then, bending sorrowful and lank over the dead man, he too turned
and hurried out.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon stood, still as death, his eyes fixed on the body.
Who shall tell of what he was thinking? Of himself, when his hair
was brown like the hair of that young fellow dead before him? Of
himself, with his battle just beginning, the long, long battle he
had loved; the battle that was over for this young man almost
before it had begun? Of his grand-daughter, with her broken hopes?
Of that other woman? Of the strangeness, and the pity of it? And
the irony, inscrutable, and bitter of that end? Justice! There was
no justice for men, for they were ever in the dark!</p>

<p>Or perhaps in his philosophy he thought: Better to be out of, it
all! Better to have done with it, like this poor youth...</p>

<p>Some one touched him on the arm.</p>

<p>A tear started up and wetted his eyelash. "Well," he said, "I'm
no good here. I'd better be going. You'll come to me as soon as you
can, Jo," and with his head bowed he went away.</p>

<p>It was young Jolyon's turn to take his stand beside the dead
man, round whose fallen body he seemed to see all the Forsytes
breathless, and prostrated. The stroke had fallen too swiftly.</p>

<p>The forces underlying every tragedy&mdash;forces that take no
denial, working through cross currents to their ironical end, had
met and fused with a thunder-clap, flung out the victim, and
flattened to the ground all those that stood around.</p>

<p>Or so at all events young Jolyon seemed to see them, lying
around Bosinney's body.</p>

<p>He asked the Inspector to tell him what had happened, and the
latter, like a man who does not every day get such a chance, again
detailed such facts as were known.</p>

<p>"There's more here, sir, however," he said, "than meets the eye.
I don't believe in suicide, nor in pure accident, myself. It's more
likely I think that he was suffering under great stress of mind,
and took no notice of things about him. Perhaps you can throw some
light on these."</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a little packet and laid it on the
table. Carefully undoing it, he revealed a lady's handkerchief,
pinned through the folds with a pin of discoloured Venetian gold,
the stone of which had fallen from the socket. A scent of dried
violets rose to young Jolyon's nostrils.</p>

<p>"Found in his breast pocket," said the Inspector; "the name has
been cut away!"</p>

<p>Young Jolyon with difficulty answered: "I'm afraid I cannot help
you!" But vividly there rose before him the face he had seen light
up, so tremulous and glad, at Bosinney's coming! Of her he thought
more than of his own daughter, more than of them all&mdash;of her
with the dark, soft glance, the delicate passive face, waiting for
the dead man, waiting even at that moment, perhaps, still and
patient in the sunlight.</p>

<p>He walked sorrowfully away from the hospital towards his
father's house, reflecting that this death would break up the
Forsyte family. The stroke had indeed slipped past their defences
into the very wood of their tree. They might flourish to all
appearance as before, preserving a brave show before the eyes of
London, but the trunk was dead, withered by the same flash that had
stricken down Bosinney. And now the saplings would take its place,
each one a new custodian of the sense of property.</p>

<p>Good forest of Forsytes! thought young Jolyon&mdash;soundest
timber of our land!</p>

<p>Concerning the cause of this death&mdash;his family would
doubtless reject with vigour the suspicion of suicide, which was so
compromising! They would take it as an accident, a stroke of fate.
In their hearts they would even feel it an intervention of
Providence, a retribution&mdash;had not Bosinney endangered their
two most priceless possessions, the pocket and the hearth? And they
would talk of 'that unfortunate accident of young Bosinney's,' but
perhaps they would not talk&mdash;silence might be better!</p>

<p>As for himself, he regarded the bus-driver's account of the
accident as of very little value. For no one so madly in love
committed suicide for want of money; nor was Bosinney the sort of
fellow to set much store by a financial crisis. And so he too
rejected this theory of suicide, the dead man's face rose too
clearly before him. Gone in the heyday of his summer&mdash;and to
believe thus that an accident had cut Bosinney off in the full
sweep of his passion was more than ever pitiful to young
Jolyon.</p>

<p>Then came a vision of Soames' home as it now was, and must be
hereafter. The streak of lightning had flashed its clear uncanny
gleam on bare bones with grinning spaces between, the disguising
flesh was gone...</p>

<p>In the dining-room at Stanhope Gate old Jolyon was sitting alone
when his son came in. He looked very wan in his great armchair. And
his eyes travelling round the walls with their pictures of still
life, and the masterpiece 'Dutch fishing-boats at Sunset' seemed as
though passing their gaze over his life with its hopes, its gains,
its achievements.</p>

<p>"Ah! Jo!" he said, "is that you? I've told poor little June. But
that's not all of it. Are you going to Soames'? She's brought it on
herself, I suppose; but somehow I can't bear to think of her, shut
up there&mdash;and all alone." And holding up his thin, veined
hand, he clenched it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX&mdash;IRENE'S RETURN</h3>

<p>After leaving James and old Jolyon in the mortuary of the
hospital, Soames hurried aimlessly along the streets.</p>

<p>The tragic event of Bosinney's death altered the complexion of
everything. There was no longer the same feeling that to lose a
minute would be fatal, nor would he now risk communicating the fact
of his wife's flight to anyone till the inquest was over.</p>

<p>That morning he had risen early, before the postman came, had
taken the first-post letters from the box himself, and, though
there had been none from Irene, he had made an opportunity of
telling Bilson that her mistress was at the sea; he would probably,
he said, be going down himself from Saturday to Monday. This had
given him time to breathe, time to leave no stone unturned to find
her.</p>

<p>But now, cut off from taking steps by Bosinney's
death&mdash;that strange death, to think of which was like putting
a hot iron to his heart, like lifting a great weight from
it&mdash;he did not know how to pass his day; and he wandered here
and there through the streets, looking at every face he met,
devoured by a hundred anxieties.</p>

<p>And as he wandered, he thought of him who had finished his
wandering, his prowling, and would never haunt his house again.</p>

<p>Already in the afternoon he passed posters announcing the
identity of the dead man, and bought the papers to see what they
said. He would stop their mouths if he could, and he went into the
City, and was closeted with Boulter for a long time.</p>

<p>On his way home, passing the steps of Jobson's about half past
four, he met George Forsyte, who held out an evening paper to
Soames, saying:</p>

<p>"Here! Have you seen this about the poor Buccaneer?"</p>

<p>Soames answered stonily: "Yes."</p>

<p>George stared at him. He had never liked Soames; he now held him
responsible for Bosinney's death. Soames had done for
him&mdash;done for him by that act of property that had sent the
Buccaneer to run amok that fatal afternoon.</p>

<p>'The poor fellow,' he was thinking, 'was so cracked with
jealousy, so cracked for his vengeance, that he heard nothing of
the omnibus in that infernal fog.'</p>

<p>Soames had done for him! And this judgment was in George's
eyes.</p>

<p>"They talk of suicide here," he said at last. "That cat won't
jump."</p>

<p>Soames shook his head. "An accident," he muttered.</p>

<p>Clenching his fist on the paper, George crammed it into his
pocket. He could not resist a parting shot.</p>

<p>"H'mm! All flourishing at home? Any little Soameses yet?"</p>

<p>With a face as white as the steps of Jobson's, and a lip raised
as if snarling, Soames brushed past him and was gone...</p>

<p>On reaching home, and entering the little lighted hall with his
latchkey, the first thing that caught his eye was his wife's
gold-mounted umbrella lying on the rug chest. Flinging off his fur
coat, he hurried to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The curtains were drawn for the night, a bright fire of
cedar-logs burned in the grate, and by its light he saw Irene
sitting in her usual corner on the sofa. He shut the door softly,
and went towards her. She did not move, and did not seem to see
him.</p>

<p>"So you've come back?" he said. "Why are you sitting here in the
dark?"</p>

<p>Then he caught sight of her face, so white and motionless that
it seemed as though the blood must have stopped flowing in her
veins; and her eyes, that looked enormous, like the great, wide,
startled brown eyes of an owl.</p>

<p>Huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions, she had a
strange resemblance to a captive owl, bunched fir its soft feathers
against the wires of a cage. The supple erectness of her figure was
gone, as though she had been broken by cruel exercise; as though
there were no longer any reason for being beautiful, and supple,
and erect.</p>

<p>"So you've come back," he repeated.</p>

<p>She never looked up, and never spoke, the firelight playing over
her motionless figure.</p>

<p>Suddenly she tried to rise, but he prevented her; it was then
that he understood.</p>

<p>She had come back like an animal wounded to death, not knowing
where to turn, not knowing what she was doing. The sight of her
figure, huddled in the fur, was enough.</p>

<p>He knew then for certain that Bosinney had been her lover; knew
that she had seen the report of his death&mdash;perhaps, like
himself, had bought a paper at the draughty corner of a street, and
read it.</p>

<p>She had come back then of her own accord, to the cage she had
pined to be free of&mdash;and taking in all the tremendous
significance of this, he longed to cry: "Take your hated body, that
I love, out of my house! Take away that pitiful white face, so
cruel and soft&mdash;before I crush it. Get out of my sight; never
let me see you again!"</p>

<p>And, at those unspoken words, he seemed to see her rise and move
away, like a woman in a terrible dream, from which she was fighting
to awake&mdash;rise and go out into the dark and cold, without a
thought of him, without so much as the knowledge of his
presence.</p>

<p>Then he cried, contradicting what he had not yet spoken, "No;
stay there!" And turning away from her, he sat down in his
accustomed chair on the other side of the hearth.</p>

<p>They sat in silence.</p>

<p>And Soames thought: 'Why is all this? Why should I suffer so?
What have I done? It is not my fault!'</p>

<p>Again he looked at her, huddled like a bird that is shot and
dying, whose poor breast you see panting as the air is taken from
it, whose poor eyes look at you who have shot it, with a slow,
soft, unseeing look, taking farewell of all that is good&mdash;of
the sun, and the air, and its mate.</p>

<p>So they sat, by the firelight, in the silence, one on each side
of the hearth.</p>

<p>And the fume of the burning cedar logs, that he loved so well,
seemed to grip Soames by the throat till he could bear it no
longer. And going out into the hall he flung the door wide, to gulp
down the cold air that came in; then without hat or overcoat went
out into the Square.</p>

<p>Along the garden rails a half-starved cat came rubbing her way
towards him, and Soames thought: 'Suffering! when will it cease, my
suffering?'</p>

<p>At a front door across the way was a man of his acquaintance
named Rutter, scraping his boots, with an air of 'I am master
here.' And Soames walked on.</p>

<p>From far in the clear air the bells of the church where he and
Irene had been married were pealing in 'practice' for the advent of
Christ, the chimes ringing out above the sound of traffic. He felt
a craving for strong drink, to lull him to indifference, or rouse
him to fury. If only he could burst out of himself, out of this web
that for the first time in his life he felt around him. If only he
could surrender to the thought: 'Divorce her&mdash;turn her out!
She has forgotten you. Forget her!'</p>

<p>If only he could surrender to the thought: 'Let her go&mdash;she
has suffered enough!'</p>

<p>If only he could surrender to the desire: 'Make a slave of
her&mdash;she is in your power!'</p>

<p>If only even he could surrender to the sudden vision: 'What does
it all matter?' Forget himself for a minute, forget that it
mattered what he did, forget that whatever he did he must sacrifice
something.</p>

<p>If only he could act on an impulse!</p>

<p>He could forget nothing; surrender to no thought, vision, or
desire; it was all too serious; too close around him, an
unbreakable cage.</p>

<p>On the far side of the Square newspaper boys were calling their
evening wares, and the ghoulish cries mingled and jangled with the
sound of those church bells.</p>

<p>Soames covered his ears. The thought flashed across him that but
for a chance, he himself, and not Bosinney, might be lying dead,
and she, instead of crouching there like a shot bird with those
dying eyes...</p>

<p>Something soft touched his legs, the cat was rubbing herself
against them. And a sob that shook him from head to foot burst from
Soames' chest. Then all was still again in the dark, where the
houses seemed to stare at him, each with a master and mistress of
its own, and a secret story of happiness or sorrow.</p>

<p>And suddenly he saw that his own door was open, and black
against the light from the hall a man standing with his back
turned. Something slid too in his breast, and he stole up close
behind.</p>

<p>He could see his own fur coat flung across the carved oak chair;
the Persian rugs; the silver bowls, the rows of porcelain plates
arranged along the walls, and this unknown man who was standing
there.</p>

<p>And sharply he asked: "What is it you want, sir?"</p>

<p>The visitor turned. It was young Jolyon.</p>

<p>"The door was open," he said. "Might I see your wife for a
minute, I have a message for her?"</p>

<p>Soames gave him a strange, sidelong stare.</p>

<p>"My wife can see no one," he muttered doggedly.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon answered gently: "I shouldn't keep her a
minute."</p>

<p>Soames brushed by him and barred the way.</p>

<p>"She can see no one," he said again.</p>

<p>Young Jolyon's glance shot past him into the hall, and Soames
turned. There in the drawing-room doorway stood Irene, her eyes
were wild and eager, her lips were parted, her hands outstretched.
In the sight of both men that light vanished from her face; her
hands dropped to her sides; she stood like stone.</p>

<p>Soames spun round, and met his visitor's eyes, and at the look
he saw in them, a sound like a snarl escaped him. He drew his lips
back in the ghost of a smile.</p>

<p>"This is my house," he said; "I manage my own affairs. I've told
you once&mdash;I tell you again; we are not at home."</p>

<p>And in young Jolyon's face he slammed the door.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>In the last day of May in the early 'nineties, about six o'clock
of the evening, old Jolyon Forsyte sat under the oak tree below the
terrace of his house at Robin Hill. He was waiting for the midges
to bite him, before abandoning the glory of the afternoon. His thin
brown hand, where blue veins stood out, held the end of a cigar in
its tapering, long-nailed fingers&mdash;a pointed polished nail had
survived with him from those earlier Victorian days when to touch
nothing, even with the tips of the fingers, had been so
distinguished. His domed forehead, great white moustache, lean
cheeks, and long lean jaw were covered from the westering sunshine
by an old brown Panama hat. His legs were crossed; in all his
attitude was serenity and a kind of elegance, as of an old man who
every morning put eau de Cologne upon his silk handkerchief. At his
feet lay a woolly brown-and-white dog trying to be a
Pomeranian&mdash;the dog Balthasar between whom and old Jolyon
primal aversion had changed into attachment with the years. Close
to his chair was a swing, and on the swing was seated one of
Holly's dolls&mdash;called 'Duffer Alice'&mdash;with her body
fallen over her legs and her doleful nose buried in a black
petticoat. She was never out of disgrace, so it did not matter to
her how she sat. Below the oak tree the lawn dipped down a bank,
stretched to the fernery, and, beyond that refinement, became
fields, dropping to the pond, the coppice, and the
prospect&mdash;'Fine, remarkable'&mdash;at which Swithin Forsyte,
from under this very tree, had stared five years ago when he drove
down with Irene to look at the house. Old Jolyon had heard of his
brother's exploit&mdash;that drive which had become quite
celebrated on Forsyte 'Change. Swithin! And the fellow had gone and
died, last November, at the age of only seventy-nine, renewing the
doubt whether Forsytes could live for ever, which had first arisen
when Aunt Ann passed away. Died! and left only Jolyon and James,
Roger and Nicholas and Timothy, Julia, Hester, Susan! And old
Jolyon thought: 'Eighty-five! I don't feel it&mdash;except when I
get that pain.'</p>

<p>His memory went searching. He had not felt his age since he had
bought his nephew Soames' ill-starred house and settled into it
here at Robin Hill over three years ago. It was as if he had been
getting younger every spring, living in the country with his son
and his grandchildren&mdash;June, and the little ones of the second
marriage, Jolly and Holly; living down here out of the racket of
London and the cackle of Forsyte 'Change,' free of his boards, in a
delicious atmosphere of no work and all play, with plenty of
occupation in the perfecting and mellowing of the house and its
twenty acres, and in ministering to the whims of Holly and Jolly.
All the knots and crankiness, which had gathered in his heart
during that long and tragic business of June, Soames, Irene his
wife, and poor young Bosinney, had been smoothed out. Even June had
thrown off her melancholy at last&mdash;witness this travel in
Spain she was taking now with her father and her stepmother.
Curiously perfect peace was left by their departure; blissful, yet
blank, because his son was not there. Jo was never anything but a
comfort and a pleasure to him nowadays&mdash;an amiable chap; but
women, somehow&mdash;even the best&mdash;got a little on one's
nerves, unless of course one admired them.</p>

<p>Far-off a cuckoo called; a wood-pigeon was cooing from the first
elm-tree in the field, and how the daisies and buttercups had
sprung up after the last mowing! The wind had got into the sou'
west, too&mdash;a delicious air, sappy! He pushed his hat back and
let the sun fall on his chin and cheek. Somehow, to-day, he wanted
company&mdash;wanted a pretty face to look at. People treated the
old as if they wanted nothing. And with the un-Forsytean philosophy
which ever intruded on his soul, he thought: 'One's never had
enough. With a foot in the grave one'll want something, I shouldn't
be surprised!' Down here&mdash;away from the exigencies of
affairs&mdash;his grandchildren, and the flowers, trees, birds of
his little domain, to say nothing of sun and moon and stars above
them, said, 'Open, sesame,' to him day and night. And sesame had
opened&mdash;how much, perhaps, he did not know. He had always been
responsive to what they had begun to call 'Nature,' genuinely,
almost religiously responsive, though he had never lost his habit
of calling a sunset a sunset and a view a view, however deeply they
might move him. But nowadays Nature actually made him ache, he
appreciated it so. Every one of these calm, bright, lengthening
days, with Holly's hand in his, and the dog Balthasar in front
looking studiously for what he never found, he would stroll,
watching the roses open, fruit budding on the walls, sunlight
brightening the oak leaves and saplings in the coppice, watching
the water-lily leaves unfold and glisten, and the silvery young
corn of the one wheat field; listening to the starlings and
skylarks, and the Alderney cows chewing the cud, flicking slow
their tufted tails; and every one of these fine days he ached a
little from sheer love of it all, feeling perhaps, deep down, that
he had not very much longer to enjoy it. The thought that some
day&mdash;perhaps not ten years hence, perhaps not five&mdash;all
this world would be taken away from him, before he had exhausted
his powers of loving it, seemed to him in the nature of an
injustice brooding over his horizon. If anything came after this
life, it wouldn't be what he wanted; not Robin Hill, and flowers
and birds and pretty faces&mdash;too few, even now, of those about
him! With the years his dislike of humbug had increased; the
orthodoxy he had worn in the 'sixties, as he had worn side-whiskers
out of sheer exuberance, had long dropped off, leaving him reverent
before three things alone&mdash;beauty, upright conduct, and the
sense of property; and the greatest of these now was beauty. He had
always had wide interests, and, indeed could still read The Times,
but he was liable at any moment to put it down if he heard a
blackbird sing. Upright conduct, property&mdash;somehow, they were
tiring; the blackbirds and the sunsets never tired him, only gave
him an uneasy feeling that he could not get enough of them. Staring
into the stilly radiance of the early evening and at the little
gold and white flowers on the lawn, a thought came to him: This
weather was like the music of 'Orfeo,' which he had recently heard
at Covent Garden. A beautiful opera, not like Meyerbeer, nor even
quite Mozart, but, in its way, perhaps even more lovely; something
classical and of the Golden Age about it, chaste and mellow, and
the Ravogli 'almost worthy of the old days'&mdash;highest praise he
could bestow. The yearning of Orpheus for the beauty he was losing,
for his love going down to Hades, as in life love and beauty did
go&mdash;the yearning which sang and throbbed through the golden
music, stirred also in the lingering beauty of the world that
evening. And with the tip of his cork-soled, elastic-sided boot he
involuntarily stirred the ribs of the dog Balthasar, causing the
animal to wake and attack his fleas; for though he was supposed to
have none, nothing could persuade him of the fact. When he had
finished he rubbed the place he had been scratching against his
master's calf, and settled down again with his chin over the instep
of the disturbing boot. And into old Jolyon's mind came a sudden
recollection&mdash;a face he had seen at that opera three weeks
ago&mdash;Irene, the wife of his precious nephew Soames, that man
of property! Though he had not met her since the day of the 'At
Home' in his old house at Stanhope Gate, which celebrated his
granddaughter June's ill-starred engagement to young Bosinney, he
had remembered her at once, for he had always admired her&mdash;a
very pretty creature. After the death of young Bosinney, whose
mistress she had so reprehensibly become, he had heard that she had
left Soames at once. Goodness only knew what she had been doing
since. That sight of her face&mdash;a side view&mdash;in the row in
front, had been literally the only reminder these three years that
she was still alive. No one ever spoke of her. And yet Jo had told
him something once&mdash;something which had upset him completely.
The boy had got it from George Forsyte, he believed, who had seen
Bosinney in the fog the day he was run over&mdash;something which
explained the young fellow's distress&mdash;an act of Soames
towards his wife&mdash;a shocking act. Jo had seen her, too, that
afternoon, after the news was out, seen her for a moment, and his
description had always lingered in old Jolyon's mind&mdash;'wild
and lost' he had called her. And next day June had gone
there&mdash;bottled up her feelings and gone there, and the maid
had cried and told her how her mistress had slipped out in the
night and vanished. A tragic business altogether! One thing was
certain&mdash;Soames had never been able to lay hands on her again.
And he was living at Brighton, and journeying up and down&mdash;a
fitting fate, the man of property! For when he once took a dislike
to anyone&mdash;as he had to his nephew&mdash;old Jolyon never got
over it. He remembered still the sense of relief with which he had
heard the news of Irene's disappearance. It had been shocking to
think of her a prisoner in that house to which she must have
wandered back, when Jo saw her, wandered back for a
moment&mdash;like a wounded animal to its hole after seeing that
news, 'Tragic death of an Architect,' in the street. Her face had
struck him very much the other night&mdash;more beautiful than he
had remembered, but like a mask, with something going on beneath
it. A young woman still&mdash;twenty-eight perhaps. Ah, well! Very
likely she had another lover by now. But at this subversive
thought&mdash;for married women should never love: once, even, had
been too much&mdash;his instep rose, and with it the dog
Balthasar's head. The sagacious animal stood up and looked into old
Jolyon's face. 'Walk?' he seemed to say; and old Jolyon answered:
"Come on, old chap!"</p>

<p>Slowly, as was their wont, they crossed among the constellations
of buttercups and daisies, and entered the fernery. This feature,
where very little grew as yet, had been judiciously dropped below
the level of the lawn so that it might come up again on the level
of the other lawn and give the impression of irregularity, so
important in horticulture. Its rocks and earth were beloved of the
dog Balthasar, who sometimes found a mole there. Old Jolyon made a
point of passing through it because, though it was not beautiful,
he intended that it should be, some day, and he would think: 'I
must get Varr to come down and look at it; he's better than Beech.'
For plants, like houses and human complaints, required the best
expert consideration. It was inhabited by snails, and if
accompanied by his grandchildren, he would point to one and tell
them the story of the little boy who said: 'Have plummers got
leggers, Mother? 'No, sonny.' 'Then darned if I haven't been and
swallowed a snileybob.' And when they skipped and clutched his
hand, thinking of the snileybob going down the little boy's 'red
lane,' his eyes would twinkle. Emerging from the fernery, he opened
the wicket gate, which just there led into the first field, a large
and park-like area, out of which, within brick walls, the vegetable
garden had been carved. Old Jolyon avoided this, which did not suit
his mood, and made down the hill towards the pond. Balthasar, who
knew a water-rat or two, gambolled in front, at the gait which
marks an oldish dog who takes the same walk every day. Arrived at
the edge, old Jolyon stood, noting another water-lily opened since
yesterday; he would show it to Holly to-morrow, when 'his little
sweet' had got over the upset which had followed on her eating a
tomato at lunch&mdash;her little arrangements were very delicate.
Now that Jolly had gone to school&mdash;his first term&mdash;Holly
was with him nearly all day long, and he missed her badly. He felt
that pain too, which often bothered him now, a little dragging at
his left side. He looked back up the hill. Really, poor young
Bosinney had made an uncommonly good job of the house; he would
have done very well for himself if he had lived! And where was he
now? Perhaps, still haunting this, the site of his last work, of
his tragic love affair. Or was Philip Bosinney's spirit diffused in
the general? Who could say? That dog was getting his legs muddy!
And he moved towards the coppice. There had been the most
delightful lot of bluebells, and he knew where some still lingered
like little patches of sky fallen in between the trees, away out of
the sun. He passed the cow-houses and the hen-houses there
installed, and pursued a path into the thick of the saplings,
making for one of the bluebell plots. Balthasar, preceding him once
more, uttered a low growl. Old Jolyon stirred him with his foot,
but the dog remained motionless, just where there was no room to
pass, and the hair rose slowly along the centre of his woolly back.
Whether from the growl and the look of the dog's stivered hair, or
from the sensation which a man feels in a wood, old Jolyon also
felt something move along his spine. And then the path turned, and
there was an old mossy log, and on it a woman sitting. Her face was
turned away, and he had just time to think: 'She's
trespassing&mdash;I must have a board put up!' before she turned.
Powers above! The face he had seen at the opera&mdash;the very
woman he had just been thinking of! In that confused moment he saw
things blurred, as if a spirit&mdash;queer effect&mdash;the slant
of sunlight perhaps on her violet-grey frock! And then she rose and
stood smiling, her head a little to one side. Old Jolyon thought:
'How pretty she is!' She did not speak, neither did he; and he
realized why with a certain admiration. She was here no doubt
because of some memory, and did not mean to try and get out of it
by vulgar explanation.</p>

<p>"Don't let that dog touch your frock," he said; "he's got wet
feet. Come here, you!"</p>

<p>But the dog Balthasar went on towards the visitor, who put her
hand down and stroked his head. Old Jolyon said quickly:</p>

<p>"I saw you at the opera the other night; you didn't notice
me."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I did."</p>

<p>He felt a subtle flattery in that, as though she had added: 'Do
you think one could miss seeing you?'</p>

<p>"They're all in Spain," he remarked abruptly. "I'm alone; I
drove up for the opera. The Ravogli's good. Have you seen the
cow-houses?"</p>

<p>In a situation so charged with mystery and something very like
emotion he moved instinctively towards that bit of property, and
she moved beside him. Her figure swayed faintly, like the best kind
of French figures; her dress, too, was a sort of French grey. He
noticed two or three silver threads in her amber-coloured hair,
strange hair with those dark eyes of hers, and that creamy-pale
face. A sudden sidelong look from the velvety brown eyes disturbed
him. It seemed to come from deep and far, from another world
almost, or at all events from some one not living very much in
this. And he said mechanically:</p>

<p>"Where are you living now?"</p>

<p>"I have a little flat in Chelsea."</p>

<p>He did not want to hear what she was doing, did not want to hear
anything; but the perverse word came out:</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>She nodded. It was a relief to know that. And it came into his
mind that, but for a twist of fate, she would have been mistress of
this coppice, showing these cow-houses to him, a visitor.</p>

<p>"All Alderneys," he muttered; "they give the best milk. This
one's a pretty creature. Woa, Myrtle!"</p>

<p>The fawn-coloured cow, with eyes as soft and brown as Irene's
own, was standing absolutely still, not having long been milked.
She looked round at them out of the corner of those lustrous, mild,
cynical eyes, and from her grey lips a little dribble of saliva
threaded its way towards the straw. The scent of hay and vanilla
and ammonia rose in the dim light of the cool cow-house; and old
Jolyon said:</p>

<p>"You must come up and have some dinner with me. I'll send you
home in the carriage."</p>

<p>He perceived a struggle going on within her; natural, no doubt,
with her memories. But he wanted her company; a pretty face, a
charming figure, beauty! He had been alone all the afternoon.
Perhaps his eyes were wistful, for she answered: "Thank you, Uncle
Jolyon. I should like to."</p>

<p>He rubbed his hands, and said:</p>

<p>"Capital! Let's go up, then!" And, preceded by the dog
Balthasar, they ascended through the field. The sun was almost
level in their faces now, and he could see, not only those silver
threads, but little lines, just deep enough to stamp her beauty
with a coin-like fineness&mdash;the special look of life unshared
with others. "I'll take her in by the terrace," he thought: "I
won't make a common visitor of her."</p>

<p>"What do you do all day?" he said.</p>

<p>"Teach music; I have another interest, too."</p>

<p>"Work!" said old Jolyon, picking up the doll from off the swing,
and smoothing its black petticoat. "Nothing like it, is there? I
don't do any now. I'm getting on. What interest is that?"</p>

<p>"Trying to help women who've come to grief." Old Jolyon did not
quite understand. "To grief?" he repeated; then realised with a
shock that she meant exactly what he would have meant himself if he
had used that expression. Assisting the Magdalenes of London! What
a weird and terrifying interest! And, curiosity overcoming his
natural shrinking, he asked:</p>

<p>"Why? What do you do for them?"</p>

<p>"Not much. I've no money to spare. I can only give sympathy and
food sometimes."</p>

<p>Involuntarily old Jolyon's hand sought his purse. He said
hastily: "How d'you get hold of them?"</p>

<p>"I go to a hospital."</p>

<p>"A hospital! Phew!"</p>

<p>"What hurts me most is that once they nearly all had some sort
of beauty."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon straightened the doll. "Beauty!" he ejaculated: "Ha!
Yes! A sad business!" and he moved towards the house. Through a
French window, under sun-blinds not yet drawn up, he preceded her
into the room where he was wont to study The Times and the sheets
of an agricultural magazine, with huge illustrations of mangold
wurzels, and the like, which provided Holly with material for her
paint brush.</p>

<p>"Dinner's in half an hour. You'd like to wash your hands! I'll
take you to June's room."</p>

<p>He saw her looking round eagerly; what changes since she had
last visited this house with her husband, or her lover, or both
perhaps&mdash;he did not know, could not say! All that was dark,
and he wished to leave it so. But what changes! And in the hall he
said:</p>

<p>"My boy Jo's a painter, you know. He's got a lot of taste. It
isn't mine, of course, but I've let him have his way."</p>

<p>She was standing very still, her eyes roaming through the hall
and music room, as it now was&mdash;all thrown into one, under the
great skylight. Old Jolyon had an odd impression of her. Was she
trying to conjure somebody from the shades of that space where the
colouring was all pearl-grey and silver? He would have had gold
himself; more lively and solid. But Jo had French tastes, and it
had come out shadowy like that, with an effect as of the fume of
cigarettes the chap was always smoking, broken here and there by a
little blaze of blue or crimson colour. It was not his dream!
Mentally he had hung this space with those gold-framed masterpieces
of still and stiller life which he had bought in days when quantity
was precious. And now where were they? Sold for a song! That
something which made him, alone among Forsytes, move with the times
had warned him against the struggle to retain them. But in his
study he still had 'Dutch Fishing Boats at Sunset.'</p>

<p>He began to mount the stairs with her, slowly, for he felt his
side.</p>

<p>"These are the bathrooms," he said, "and other arrangements.
I've had them tiled. The nurseries are along there. And this is
Jo's and his wife's. They all communicate. But you remember, I
expect."</p>

<p>Irene nodded. They passed on, up the gallery and entered a large
room with a small bed, and several windows.</p>

<p>"This is mine," he said. The walls were covered with the
photographs of children and watercolour sketches, and he added
doubtfully:</p>

<p>"These are Jo's. The view's first-rate. You can see the Grand
Stand at Epsom in clear weather."</p>

<p>The sun was down now, behind the house, and over the 'prospect'
a luminous haze had settled, emanation of the long and prosperous
day. Few houses showed, but fields and trees faintly glistened,
away to a loom of downs.</p>

<p>"The country's changing," he said abruptly, "but there it'll be
when we're all gone. Look at those thrushes&mdash;the birds are
sweet here in the mornings. I'm glad to have washed my hands of
London."</p>

<p>Her face was close to the window pane, and he was struck by its
mournful look. 'Wish I could make her look happy!' he thought. 'A
pretty face, but sad!' And taking up his can of hot water he went
out into the gallery.</p>

<p>"This is June's room," he said, opening the next door and
putting the can down; "I think you'll find everything." And closing
the door behind her he went back to his own room. Brushing his hair
with his great ebony brushes, and dabbing his forehead with eau de
Cologne, he mused. She had come so strangely&mdash;a sort of
visitation; mysterious, even romantic, as if his desire for
company, for beauty, had been fulfilled by whatever it was which
fulfilled that sort of thing. And before the mirror he straightened
his still upright figure, passed the brushes over his great white
moustache, touched up his eyebrows with eau de Cologne, and rang
the bell.</p>

<p>"I forgot to let them know that I have a lady to dinner with me.
Let cook do something extra, and tell Beacon to have the landau and
pair at half-past ten to drive her back to Town to-night. Is Miss
Holly asleep?"</p>

<p>The maid thought not. And old Jolyon, passing down the gallery,
stole on tiptoe towards the nursery, and opened the door whose
hinges he kept specially oiled that he might slip in and out in the
evenings without being heard.</p>

<p>But Holly was asleep, and lay like a miniature Madonna, of that
type which the old painters could not tell from Venus, when they
had completed her. Her long dark lashes clung to her cheeks; on her
face was perfect peace&mdash;her little arrangements were evidently
all right again. And old Jolyon, in the twilight of the room, stood
adoring her! It was so charming, solemn, and loving&mdash;that
little face. He had more than his share of the blessed capacity of
living again in the young. They were to him his future
life&mdash;all of a future life that his fundamental pagan sanity
perhaps admitted. There she was with everything before her, and his
blood&mdash;some of it&mdash;in her tiny veins. There she was, his
little companion, to be made as happy as ever he could make her, so
that she knew nothing but love. His heart swelled, and he went out,
stilling the sound of his patent-leather boots. In the corridor an
eccentric notion attacked him: To think that children should come
to that which Irene had told him she was helping! Women who were
all, once, little things like this one sleeping there! 'I must give
her a cheque!' he mused; 'Can't bear to think of them!' They had
never borne reflecting on, those poor outcasts; wounding too deeply
the core of true refinement hidden under layers of conformity to
the sense of property&mdash;wounding too grievously the deepest
thing in him&mdash;a love of beauty which could give him, even now,
a flutter of the heart, thinking of his evening in the society of a
pretty woman. And he went downstairs, through the swinging doors,
to the back regions. There, in the wine-cellar, was a hock worth at
least two pounds a bottle, a Steinberg Cabinet, better than any
Johannisberg that ever went down throat; a wine of perfect bouquet,
sweet as a nectarine&mdash;nectar indeed! He got a bottle out,
handling it like a baby, and holding it level to the light, to
look. Enshrined in its coat of dust, that mellow coloured,
slender-necked bottle gave him deep pleasure. Three years to settle
down again since the move from Town&mdash;ought to be in prime
condition! Thirty-five years ago he had bought it&mdash;thank God
he had kept his palate, and earned the right to drink it. She would
appreciate this; not a spice of acidity in a dozen. He wiped the
bottle, drew the cork with his own hands, put his nose down,
inhaled its perfume, and went back to the music room.</p>

<p>Irene was standing by the piano; she had taken off her hat and a
lace scarf she had been wearing, so that her gold-coloured hair was
visible, and the pallor of her neck. In her grey frock she made a
pretty picture for old Jolyon, against the rosewood of the
piano.</p>

<p>He gave her his arm, and solemnly they went. The room, which had
been designed to enable twenty-four people to dine in comfort, held
now but a little round table. In his present solitude the big
dining-table oppressed old Jolyon; he had caused it to be removed
till his son came back. Here in the company of two really good
copies of Raphael Madonnas he was wont to dine alone. It was the
only disconsolate hour of his day, this summer weather. He had
never been a large eater, like that great chap Swithin, or Sylvanus
Heythorp, or Anthony Thornworthy, those cronies of past times; and
to dine alone, overlooked by the Madonnas, was to him but a
sorrowful occupation, which he got through quickly, that he might
come to the more spiritual enjoyment of his coffee and cigar. But
this evening was a different matter! His eyes twinkled at her
across the little table and he spoke of Italy and Switzerland,
telling her stories of his travels there, and other experiences
which he could no longer recount to his son and grand-daughter
because they knew them. This fresh audience was precious to him; he
had never become one of those old men who ramble round and round
the fields of reminiscence. Himself quickly fatigued by the
insensitive, he instinctively avoided fatiguing others, and his
natural flirtatiousness towards beauty guarded him specially in his
relations with a woman. He would have liked to draw her out, but
though she murmured and smiled and seemed to be enjoying what he
told her, he remained conscious of that mysterious remoteness which
constituted half her fascination. He could not bear women who threw
their shoulders and eyes at you, and chattered away; or
hard-mouthed women who laid down the law and knew more than you
did. There was only one quality in a woman that appealed to
him&mdash;charm; and the quieter it was, the more he liked it. And
this one had charm, shadowy as afternoon sunlight on those Italian
hills and valleys he had loved. The feeling, too, that she was, as
it were, apart, cloistered, made her seem nearer to himself, a
strangely desirable companion. When a man is very old and quite out
of the running, he loves to feel secure from the rivalries of
youth, for he would still be first in the heart of beauty. And he
drank his hock, and watched her lips, and felt nearly young. But
the dog Balthasar lay watching her lips too, and despising in his
heart the interruptions of their talk, and the tilting of those
greenish glasses full of a golden fluid which was distasteful to
him.</p>

<p>The light was just failing when they went back into the
music-room. And, cigar in mouth, old Jolyon said:</p>

<p>"Play me some Chopin."</p>

<p>By the cigars they smoke, and the composers they love, ye shall
know the texture of men's souls. Old Jolyon could not bear a strong
cigar or Wagner's music. He loved Beethoven and Mozart, Handel and
Gluck, and Schumann, and, for some occult reason, the operas of
Meyerbeer; but of late years he had been seduced by Chopin, just as
in painting he had succumbed to Botticelli. In yielding to these
tastes he had been conscious of divergence from the standard of the
Golden Age. Their poetry was not that of Milton and Byron and
Tennyson; of Raphael and Titian; Mozart and Beethoven. It was, as
it were, behind a veil; their poetry hit no one in the face, but
slipped its fingers under the ribs and turned and twisted, and
melted up the heart. And, never certain that this was healthy, he
did not care a rap so long as he could see the pictures of the one
or hear the music of the other.</p>

<p>Irene sat down at the piano under the electric lamp festooned
with pearl-grey, and old Jolyon, in an armchair, whence he could
see her, crossed his legs and drew slowly at his cigar. She sat a
few moments with her hands on the keys, evidently searching her
mind for what to give him. Then she began and within old Jolyon
there arose a sorrowful pleasure, not quite like anything else in
the world. He fell slowly into a trance, interrupted only by the
movements of taking the cigar out of his mouth at long intervals,
and replacing it. She was there, and the hock within him, and the
scent of tobacco; but there, too, was a world of sunshine lingering
into moonlight, and pools with storks upon them, and bluish trees
above, glowing with blurs of wine-red roses, and fields of lavender
where milk-white cows were grazing, and a woman all shadowy, with
dark eyes and a white neck, smiled, holding out her arms; and
through air which was like music a star dropped and was caught on a
cow's horn. He opened his eyes. Beautiful piece; she played
well&mdash;the touch of an angel! And he closed them again. He felt
miraculously sad and happy, as one does, standing under a lime-tree
in full honey flower. Not live one's own life again, but just stand
there and bask in the smile of a woman's eyes, and enjoy the
bouquet! And he jerked his hand; the dog Balthasar had reached up
and licked it.</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" He said: "Go on&mdash;more Chopin!"</p>

<p>She began to play again. This time the resemblance between her
and 'Chopin' struck him. The swaying he had noticed in her walk was
in her playing too, and the Nocturne she had chosen and the soft
darkness of her eyes, the light on her hair, as of moonlight from a
golden moon. Seductive, yes; but nothing of Delilah in her or in
that music. A long blue spiral from his cigar ascended and
dispersed. 'So we go out!' he thought. 'No more beauty!
Nothing?'</p>

<p>Again Irene stopped.</p>

<p>"Would you like some Gluck? He used to write his music in a
sunlit garden, with a bottle of Rhine wine beside him."</p>

<p>"Ah! yes. Let's have 'Orfeo.'" Round about him now were fields
of gold and silver flowers, white forms swaying in the sunlight,
bright birds flying to and fro. All was summer. Lingering waves of
sweetness and regret flooded his soul. Some cigar ash dropped, and
taking out a silk handkerchief to brush it off, he inhaled a
mingled scent as of snuff and eau de Cologne. 'Ah!' he thought,
'Indian summer&mdash;that's all!' and he said: "You haven't played
me 'Che faro.'"</p>

<p>She did not answer; did not move. He was conscious of
something&mdash;some strange upset. Suddenly he saw her rise and
turn away, and a pang of remorse shot through him. What a clumsy
chap! Like Orpheus, she of course&mdash;she too was looking for her
lost one in the hall of memory! And disturbed to the heart, he got
up from his chair. She had gone to the great window at the far end.
Gingerly he followed. Her hands were folded over her breast; he
could just see her cheek, very white. And, quite emotionalized, he
said:</p>

<p>"There, there, my love!" The words had escaped him mechanically,
for they were those he used to Holly when she had a pain, but their
effect was instantaneously distressing. She raised her arms,
covered her face with them, and wept.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon stood gazing at her with eyes very deep from age. The
passionate shame she seemed feeling at her abandonment, so unlike
the control and quietude of her whole presence was as if she had
never before broken down in the presence of another being.</p>

<p>"There, there&mdash;there, there!" he murmured, and putting his
hand out reverently, touched her. She turned, and leaned the arms
which covered her face against him. Old Jolyon stood very still,
keeping one thin hand on her shoulder. Let her cry her heart
out&mdash;it would do her good.</p>

<p>And the dog Balthasar, puzzled, sat down on his stern to examine
them.</p>

<p>The window was still open, the curtains had not been drawn, the
last of daylight from without mingled with faint intrusion from the
lamp within; there was a scent of new-mown grass. With the wisdom
of a long life old Jolyon did not speak. Even grief sobbed itself
out in time; only Time was good for sorrow&mdash;Time who saw the
passing of each mood, each emotion in turn; Time the layer-to-rest.
There came into his mind the words: 'As panteth the hart after
cooling streams'&mdash;but they were of no use to him. Then,
conscious of a scent of violets, he knew she was drying her eyes.
He put his chin forward, pressed his moustache against her
forehead, and felt her shake with a quivering of her whole body, as
of a tree which shakes itself free of raindrops. She put his hand
to her lips, as if saying: "All over now! Forgive me!"</p>

<p>The kiss filled him with a strange comfort; he led her back to
where she had been so upset. And the dog Balthasar, following, laid
the bone of one of the cutlets they had eaten at their feet.</p>

<p>Anxious to obliterate the memory of that emotion, he could think
of nothing better than china; and moving with her slowly from
cabinet to cabinet, he kept taking up bits of Dresden and Lowestoft
and Chelsea, turning them round and round with his thin, veined
hands, whose skin, faintly freckled, had such an aged look.</p>

<p>"I bought this at Jobson's," he would say; "cost me thirty
pounds. It's very old. That dog leaves his bones all over the
place. This old 'ship-bowl' I picked up at the sale when that
precious rip, the Marquis, came to grief. But you don't remember.
Here's a nice piece of Chelsea. Now, what would you say this was?"
And he was comforted, feeling that, with her taste, she was taking
a real interest in these things; for, after all, nothing better
composes the nerves than a doubtful piece of china.</p>

<p>When the crunch of the carriage wheels was heard at last, he
said:</p>

<p>"You must come again; you must come to lunch, then I can show
you these by daylight, and my little sweet&mdash;she's a dear
little thing. This dog seems to have taken a fancy to you."</p>

<p>For Balthasar, feeling that she was about to leave, was rubbing
his side against her leg. Going out under the porch with her, he
said:</p>

<p>"He'll get you up in an hour and a quarter. Take this for your
protegees," and he slipped a cheque for fifty pounds into her hand.
He saw her brightened eyes, and heard her murmur: "Oh! Uncle
Jolyon!" and a real throb of pleasure went through him. That meant
one or two poor creatures helped a little, and it meant that she
would come again. He put his hand in at the window and grasped hers
once more. The carriage rolled away. He stood looking at the moon
and the shadows of the trees, and thought: 'A sweet night!
She...!'</p>

<hr>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Two days of rain, and summer set in bland and sunny. Old Jolyon
walked and talked with Holly. At first he felt taller and full of a
new vigour; then he felt restless. Almost every afternoon they
would enter the coppice, and walk as far as the log. 'Well, she's
not there!' he would think, 'of course not!' And he would feel a
little shorter, and drag his feet walking up the hill home, with
his hand clapped to his left side. Now and then the thought would
move in him: 'Did she come&mdash;or did I dream it?' and he would
stare at space, while the dog Balthasar stared at him. Of course
she would not come again! He opened the letters from Spain with
less excitement. They were not returning till July; he felt, oddly,
that he could bear it. Every day at dinner he screwed up his eyes
and looked at where she had sat. She was not there, so he unscrewed
his eyes again.</p>

<p>On the seventh afternoon he thought: 'I must go up and get some
boots.' He ordered Beacon, and set out. Passing from Putney towards
Hyde Park he reflected: 'I might as well go to Chelsea and see
her.' And he called out: "Just drive me to where you took that lady
the other night." The coachman turned his broad red face, and his
juicy lips answered: "The lady in grey, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the lady in grey." What other ladies were there! Stodgy
chap!</p>

<p>The carriage stopped before a small three-storied block of
flats, standing a little back from the river. With a practised eye
old Jolyon saw that they were cheap. 'I should think about sixty
pound a year,' he mused; and entering, he looked at the name-board.
The name 'Forsyte' was not on it, but against 'First Floor, Flat C'
were the words: 'Mrs. Irene Heron.' Ah! She had taken her maiden
name again! And somehow this pleased him. He went upstairs slowly,
feeling his side a little. He stood a moment, before ringing, to
lose the feeling of drag and fluttering there. She would not be in!
And then&mdash;Boots! The thought was black. What did he want with
boots at his age? He could not wear out all those he had.</p>

<p>"Your mistress at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Say Mr. Jolyon Forsyte."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, will you come this way?"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon followed a very little maid&mdash;not more than
sixteen one would say&mdash;into a very small drawing-room where
the sun-blinds were drawn. It held a cottage piano and little else
save a vague fragrance and good taste. He stood in the middle, with
his top hat in his hand, and thought: 'I expect she's very badly
off!' There was a mirror above the fireplace, and he saw himself
reflected. An old-looking chap! He heard a rustle, and turned
round. She was so close that his moustache almost brushed her
forehead, just under her hair.</p>

<p>"I was driving up," he said. "Thought I'd look in on you, and
ask you how you got up the other night."</p>

<p>And, seeing her smile, he felt suddenly relieved. She was really
glad to see him, perhaps.</p>

<p>"Would you like to put on your hat and come for a drive in the
Park?"</p>

<p>But while she was gone to put her hat on, he frowned. The Park!
James and Emily! Mrs. Nicholas, or some other member of his
precious family would be there very likely, prancing up and down.
And they would go and wag their tongues about having seen him with
her, afterwards. Better not! He did not wish to revive the echoes
of the past on Forsyte 'Change. He removed a white hair from the
lapel of his closely-buttoned-up frock coat, and passed his hand
over his cheeks, moustache, and square chin. It felt very hollow
there under the cheekbones. He had not been eating much
lately&mdash;he had better get that little whippersnapper who
attended Holly to give him a tonic. But she had come back and when
they were in the carriage, he said:</p>

<p>"Suppose we go and sit in Kensington Gardens instead?" and added
with a twinkle: "No prancing up and down there," as if she had been
in the secret of his thoughts.</p>

<p>Leaving the carriage, they entered those select precincts, and
strolled towards the water.</p>

<p>"You've gone back to your maiden name, I see," he said: "I'm not
sorry."</p>

<p>She slipped her hand under his arm: "Has June forgiven me, Uncle
Jolyon?"</p>

<p>He answered gently: "Yes&mdash;yes; of course, why not?"</p>

<p>"And have you?"</p>

<p>"I? I forgave you as soon as I saw how the land really lay." And
perhaps he had; his instinct had always been to forgive the
beautiful.</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath. "I never regretted&mdash;I couldn't. Did
you ever love very deeply, Uncle Jolyon?"</p>

<p>At that strange question old Jolyon stared before him. Had he?
He did not seem to remember that he ever had. But he did not like
to say this to the young woman whose hand was touching his arm,
whose life was suspended, as it were, by memory of a tragic love.
And he thought: 'If I had met you when I was young I&mdash;I might
have made a fool of myself, perhaps.' And a longing to escape in
generalities beset him.</p>

<p>"Love's a queer thing," he said, "fatal thing often. It was the
Greeks&mdash;wasn't it?&mdash;made love into a goddess; they were
right, I dare say, but then they lived in the Golden Age."</p>

<p>"Phil adored them."</p>

<p>Phil! The word jarred him, for suddenly&mdash;with his power to
see all round a thing, he perceived why she was putting up with him
like this. She wanted to talk about her lover! Well! If it was any
pleasure to her! And he said: "Ah! There was a bit of the sculptor
in him, I fancy."</p>

<p>"Yes. He loved balance and symmetry; he loved the whole-hearted
way the Greeks gave themselves to art."</p>

<p>Balance! The chap had no balance at all, if he remembered; as
for symmetry&mdash;clean-built enough he was, no doubt; but those
queer eyes of his, and high cheek-bones&mdash;Symmetry?</p>

<p>"You're of the Golden Age, too, Uncle Jolyon."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon looked round at her. Was she chaffing him? No, her
eyes were soft as velvet. Was she flattering him? But if so, why?
There was nothing to be had out of an old chap like him.</p>

<p>"Phil thought so. He used to say: 'But I can never tell him that
I admire him.'"</p>

<p>Ah! There it was again. Her dead lover; her desire to talk of
him! And he pressed her arm, half resentful of those memories, half
grateful, as if he recognised what a link they were between herself
and him.</p>

<p>"He was a very talented young fellow," he murmured. "It's hot; I
feel the heat nowadays. Let's sit down."</p>

<p>They took two chairs beneath a chestnut tree whose broad leaves
covered them from the peaceful glory of the afternoon. A pleasure
to sit there and watch her, and feel that she liked to be with him.
And the wish to increase that liking, if he could, made him go
on:</p>

<p>"I expect he showed you a side of him I never saw. He'd be at
his best with you. His ideas of art were a little new&mdash;to me
"&mdash;he had stiffed the word 'fangled.'</p>

<p>"Yes: but he used to say you had a real sense of beauty." Old
Jolyon thought: 'The devil he did!' but answered with a twinkle:
"Well, I have, or I shouldn't be sitting here with you." She was
fascinating when she smiled with her eyes, like that!</p>

<p>"He thought you had one of those hearts that never grow old.
Phil had real insight."</p>

<p>He was not taken in by this flattery spoken out of the past, out
of a longing to talk of her dead lover&mdash;not a bit; and yet it
was precious to hear, because she pleased his eyes and heart
which&mdash;quite true!&mdash;had never grown old. Was that
because&mdash;unlike her and her dead lover, he had never loved to
desperation, had always kept his balance, his sense of symmetry.
Well! It had left him power, at eighty-four, to admire beauty. And
he thought, 'If I were a painter or a sculptor! But I'm an old
chap. Make hay while the sun shines.'</p>

<p>A couple with arms entwined crossed on the grass before them, at
the edge of the shadow from their tree. The sunlight fell cruelly
on their pale, squashed, unkempt young faces. "We're an ugly lot!"
said old Jolyon suddenly. "It amazes me to see how&mdash;love
triumphs over that."</p>

<p>"Love triumphs over everything!"</p>

<p>"The young think so," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Love has no age, no limit, and no death."</p>

<p>With that glow in her pale face, her breast heaving, her eyes so
large and dark and soft, she looked like Venus come to life! But
this extravagance brought instant reaction, and, twinkling, he
said: "Well, if it had limits, we shouldn't be born; for by George!
it's got a lot to put up with."</p>

<p>Then, removing his top hat, he brushed it round with a cuff. The
great clumsy thing heated his forehead; in these days he often got
a rush of blood to the head&mdash;his circulation was not what it
had been.</p>

<p>She still sat gazing straight before her, and suddenly she
murmured:</p>

<p>"It's strange enough that I'm alive."</p>

<p>Those words of Jo's 'Wild and lost' came back to him.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said: "my son saw you for a moment&mdash;that day."</p>

<p>"Was it your son? I heard a voice in the hall; I thought for a
second it was&mdash;Phil."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon saw her lips tremble. She put her hand over them,
took it away again, and went on calmly: "That night I went to the
Embankment; a woman caught me by the dress. She told me about
herself. When one knows that others suffer, one's ashamed."</p>

<p>"One of those?"</p>

<p>She nodded, and horror stirred within old Jolyon, the horror of
one who has never known a struggle with desperation. Almost against
his will he muttered: "Tell me, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't care whether I lived or died. When you're like that,
Fate ceases to want to kill you. She took care of me three
days&mdash;she never left me. I had no money. That's why I do what
I can for them, now."</p>

<p>But old Jolyon was thinking: 'No money!' What fate could compare
with that? Every other was involved in it.</p>

<p>"I wish you had come to me," he said. "Why didn't you?" But
Irene did not answer.</p>

<p>"Because my name was Forsyte, I suppose? Or was it June who kept
you away? How are you getting on now?" His eyes involuntarily swept
her body. Perhaps even now she was&mdash;! And yet she wasn't
thin&mdash;not really!</p>

<p>"Oh! with my fifty pounds a year, I make just enough." The
answer did not reassure him; he had lost confidence. And that
fellow Soames! But his sense of justice stifled condemnation. No,
she would certainly have died rather than take another penny from
him. Soft as she looked, there must be strength in her
somewhere&mdash;strength and fidelity. But what business had young
Bosinney to have got run over and left her stranded like this!</p>

<p>"Well, you must come to me now," he said, "for anything you
want, or I shall be quite cut up." And putting on his hat, he rose.
"Let's go and get some tea. I told that lazy chap to put the horses
up for an hour, and come for me at your place. We'll take a cab
presently; I can't walk as I used to."</p>

<p>He enjoyed that stroll to the Kensington end of the
gardens&mdash;the sound of her voice, the glancing of her eyes, the
subtle beauty of a charming form moving beside him. He enjoyed
their tea at Ruffel's in the High Street, and came out thence with
a great box of chocolates swung on his little finger. He enjoyed
the drive back to Chelsea in a hansom, smoking his cigar. She had
promised to come down next Sunday and play to him again, and
already in thought he was plucking carnations and early roses for
her to carry back to town. It was a pleasure to give her a little
pleasure, if it WERE pleasure from an old chap like him! The
carriage was already there when they arrived. Just like that
fellow, who was always late when he was wanted! Old Jolyon went in
for a minute to say good-bye. The little dark hall of the flat was
impregnated with a disagreeable odour of patchouli, and on a bench
against the wall&mdash;its only furniture&mdash;he saw a figure
sitting. He heard Irene say softly: "Just one minute." In the
little drawing-room when the door was shut, he asked gravely: "One
of your protegees?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Now thanks to you, I can do something for her."</p>

<p>He stood, staring, and stroking that chin whose strength had
frightened so many in its time. The idea of her thus actually in
contact with this outcast grieved and frightened him. What could
she do for them? Nothing. Only soil and make trouble for herself,
perhaps. And he said: "Take care, my dear! The world puts the worst
construction on everything."</p>

<p>"I know that."</p>

<p>He was abashed by her quiet smile. "Well then&mdash;Sunday," he
murmured: "Good-bye."</p>

<p>She put her cheek forward for him to kiss.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said again; "take care of yourself." And he went
out, not looking towards the figure on the bench. He drove home by
way of Hammersmith; that he might stop at a place he knew of and
tell them to send her in two dozen of their best Burgundy. She must
want picking-up sometimes! Only in Richmond Park did he remember
that he had gone up to order himself some boots, and was surprised
that he could have had so paltry an idea.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The little spirits of the past which throng an old man's days
had never pushed their faces up to his so seldom as in the seventy
hours elapsing before Sunday came. The spirit of the future, with
the charm of the unknown, put up her lips instead. Old Jolyon was
not restless now, and paid no visits to the log, because she was
coming to lunch. There is wonderful finality about a meal; it
removes a world of doubts, for no one misses meals except for
reasons beyond control. He played many games with Holly on the
lawn, pitching them up to her who was batting so as to be ready to
bowl to Jolly in the holidays. For she was not a Forsyte, but Jolly
was&mdash;and Forsytes always bat, until they have resigned and
reached the age of eighty-five. The dog Balthasar, in attendance,
lay on the ball as often as he could, and the page-boy fielded,
till his face was like the harvest moon. And because the time was
getting shorter, each day was longer and more golden than the last.
On Friday night he took a liver pill, his side hurt him rather, and
though it was not the liver side, there is no remedy like that.
Anyone telling him that he had found a new excitement in life and
that excitement was not good for him, would have been met by one of
those steady and rather defiant looks of his deep-set iron-grey
eyes, which seemed to say: 'I know my own business best.' He always
had and always would.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, when Holly had gone with her governess to
church, he visited the strawberry beds. There, accompanied by the
dog Balthasar, he examined the plants narrowly and succeeded in
finding at least two dozen berries which were really ripe. Stooping
was not good for him, and he became very dizzy and red in the
forehead. Having placed the strawberries in a dish on the
dining-table, he washed his hands and bathed his forehead with eau
de Cologne. There, before the mirror, it occurred to him that he
was thinner. What a 'threadpaper' he had been when he was young! It
was nice to be slim&mdash;he could not bear a fat chap; and yet
perhaps his cheeks were too thin! She was to arrive by train at
half-past twelve and walk up, entering from the road past Drage's
farm at the far end of the coppice. And, having looked into June's
room to see that there was hot water ready, he set forth to meet
her, leisurely, for his heart was beating. The air smelled sweet,
larks sang, and the Grand Stand at Epsom was visible. A perfect
day! On just such a one, no doubt, six years ago, Soames had
brought young Bosinney down with him to look at the site before
they began to build. It was Bosinney who had pitched on the exact
spot for the house&mdash;as June had often told him. In these days
he was thinking much about that young fellow, as if his spirit were
really haunting the field of his last work, on the chance of
seeing&mdash;her. Bosinney&mdash;the one man who had possessed her
heart, to whom she had given her whole self with rapture! At his
age one could not, of course, imagine such things, but there
stirred in him a queer vague aching&mdash;as it were the ghost of
an impersonal jealousy; and a feeling, too, more generous, of pity
for that love so early lost. All over in a few poor months! Well,
well! He looked at his watch before entering the coppice&mdash;only
a quarter past, twenty-five minutes to wait! And then, turning the
corner of the path, he saw her exactly where he had seen her the
first time, on the log; and realised that she must have come by the
earlier train to sit there alone for a couple of hours at least.
Two hours of her society missed! What memory could make that log so
dear to her? His face showed what he was thinking, for she said at
once:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Uncle Jolyon; it was here that I first knew."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; there it is for you whenever you like. You're looking
a little Londony; you're giving too many lessons."</p>

<p>That she should have to give lessons worried him. Lessons to a
parcel of young girls thumping out scales with their thick
fingers.</p>

<p>"Where do you go to give them?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They're mostly Jewish families, luckily."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon stared; to all Forsytes Jews seem strange and
doubtful.</p>

<p>"They love music, and they're very kind."</p>

<p>"They had better be, by George!" He took her arm&mdash;his side
always hurt him a little going uphill&mdash;and said:</p>

<p>"Did you ever see anything like those buttercups? They came like
that in a night."</p>

<p>Her eyes seemed really to fly over the field, like bees after
the flowers and the honey. "I wanted you to see them&mdash;wouldn't
let them turn the cows in yet." Then, remembering that she had come
to talk about Bosinney, he pointed to the clock-tower over the
stables:</p>

<p>"I expect he wouldn't have let me put that there&mdash;had no
notion of time, if I remember."</p>

<p>But, pressing his arm to her, she talked of flowers instead, and
he knew it was done that he might not feel she came because of her
dead lover.</p>

<p>"The best flower I can show you," he said, with a sort of
triumph, "is my little sweet. She'll be back from Church directly.
There's something about her which reminds me a little of you," and
it did not seem to him peculiar that he had put it thus, instead of
saying: "There's something about you which reminds me a little of
her." Ah! And here she was!</p>

<p>Holly, followed closely by her elderly French governess, whose
digestion had been ruined twenty-two years ago in the siege of
Strasbourg, came rushing towards them from under the oak tree. She
stopped about a dozen yards away, to pat Balthasar and pretend that
this was all she had in her mind. Old Jolyon, who knew better,
said:</p>

<p>"Well, my darling, here's the lady in grey I promised you."</p>

<p>Holly raised herself and looked up. He watched the two of them
with a twinkle, Irene smiling, Holly beginning with grave inquiry,
passing into a shy smile too, and then to something deeper. She had
a sense of beauty, that child&mdash;knew what was what! He enjoyed
the sight of the kiss between them.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Heron, Mam'zelle Beauce. Well, Mam'zelle&mdash;good
sermon?"</p>

<p>For, now that he had not much more time before him, the only
part of the service connected with this world absorbed what
interest in church remained to him. Mam'zelle Beauce stretched out
a spidery hand clad in a black kid glove&mdash;she had been in the
best families&mdash;and the rather sad eyes of her lean yellowish
face seemed to ask: "Are you well-brrred?" Whenever Holly or Jolly
did anything unpleasing to her&mdash;a not uncommon
occurrence&mdash;she would say to them: "The little Tayleurs never
did that&mdash;they were such well-brrred little children." Jolly
hated the little Tayleurs; Holly wondered dreadfully how it was she
fell so short of them. 'A thin rum little soul,' old Jolyon thought
her&mdash;Mam'zelle Beauce.</p>

<p>Luncheon was a successful meal, the mushrooms which he himself
had picked in the mushroom house, his chosen strawberries, and
another bottle of the Steinberg cabinet filled him with a certain
aromatic spirituality, and a conviction that he would have a touch
of eczema to-morrow.</p>

<p>After lunch they sat under the oak tree drinking Turkish coffee.
It was no matter of grief to him when Mademoiselle Beauce withdrew
to write her Sunday letter to her sister, whose future had been
endangered in the past by swallowing a pin&mdash;an event held up
daily in warning to the children to eat slowly and digest what they
had eaten. At the foot of the bank, on a carriage rug, Holly and
the dog Balthasar teased and loved each other, and in the shade old
Jolyon with his legs crossed and his cigar luxuriously savoured,
gazed at Irene sitting in the swing. A light, vaguely swaying, grey
figure with a fleck of sunlight here and there upon it, lips just
opened, eyes dark and soft under lids a little drooped. She looked
content; surely it did her good to come and see him! The
selfishness of age had not set its proper grip on him, for he could
still feel pleasure in the pleasure of others, realising that what
he wanted, though much, was not quite all that mattered.</p>

<p>"It's quiet here," he said; "you mustn't come down if you find
it dull. But it's a pleasure to see you. My little sweet is the
only face which gives me any pleasure, except yours."</p>

<p>From her smile he knew that she was not beyond liking to be
appreciated, and this reassured him. "That's not humbug," he said.
"I never told a woman I admired her when I didn't. In fact I don't
know when I've told a woman I admired her, except my wife in the
old days; and wives are funny." He was silent, but resumed
abruptly:</p>

<p>"She used to expect me to say it more often than I felt it, and
there we were." Her face looked mysteriously troubled, and, afraid
that he had said something painful, he hurried on: "When my little
sweet marries, I hope she'll find someone who knows what women
feel. I shan't be here to see it, but there's too much
topsy-turvydom in marriage; I don't want her to pitch up against
that." And, aware that he had made bad worse, he added: "That dog
will scratch."</p>

<p>A silence followed. Of what was she thinking, this pretty
creature whose life was spoiled; who had done with love, and yet
was made for love? Some day when he was gone, perhaps, she would
find another mate&mdash;not so disorderly as that young fellow who
had got himself run over. Ah! but her husband?</p>

<p>"Does Soames never trouble you?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head. Her face had closed up suddenly. For all her
softness there was something irreconcilable about her. And a
glimpse of light on the inexorable nature of sex antipathies
strayed into a brain which, belonging to early Victorian
civilisation&mdash;so much older than this of his old age&mdash;had
never thought about such primitive things.</p>

<p>"That's a comfort," he said. "You can see the Grand Stand
to-day. Shall we take a turn round?"</p>

<p>Through the flower and fruit garden, against whose high outer
walls peach trees and nectarines were trained to the sun, through
the stables, the vinery, the mushroom house, the asparagus beds,
the rosery, the summer-house, he conducted her&mdash;even into the
kitchen garden to see the tiny green peas which Holly loved to
scoop out of their pods with her finger, and lick up from the palm
of her little brown hand. Many delightful things he showed her,
while Holly and the dog Balthasar danced ahead, or came to them at
intervals for attention. It was one of the happiest afternoons he
had ever spent, but it tired him and he was glad to sit down in the
music room and let her give him tea. A special little friend of
Holly's had come in&mdash;a fair child with short hair like a
boy's. And the two sported in the distance, under the stairs, on
the stairs, and up in the gallery. Old Jolyon begged for Chopin.
She played studies, mazurkas, waltzes, till the two children,
creeping near, stood at the foot of the piano their dark and golden
heads bent forward, listening. Old Jolyon watched.</p>

<p>"Let's see you dance, you two!"</p>

<p>Shyly, with a false start, they began. Bobbing and circling,
earnest, not very adroit, they went past and past his chair to the
strains of that waltz. He watched them and the face of her who was
playing turned smiling towards those little dancers thinking:</p>

<p>'Sweetest picture I've seen for ages.'</p>

<p>A voice said:</p>

<p>"Hollee! Mais enfin&mdash;qu'est-ce que tu fais la&mdash;danser,
le dimanche! Viens, donc!"</p>

<p>But the children came close to old Jolyon, knowing that he would
save them, and gazed into a face which was decidedly 'caught
out.'</p>

<p>"Better the day, better the deed, Mam'zelle. It's all my doing.
Trot along, chicks, and have your tea."</p>

<p>And, when they were gone, followed by the dog Balthasar, who
took every meal, he looked at Irene with a twinkle and said:</p>

<p>"Well, there we are! Aren't they sweet? Have you any little ones
among your pupils?"</p>

<p>"Yes, three&mdash;two of them darlings."</p>

<p>"Pretty?"</p>

<p>"Lovely!"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon sighed; he had an insatiable appetite for the very
young. "My little sweet," he said, "is devoted to music; she'll be
a musician some day. You wouldn't give me your opinion of her
playing, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like&mdash;" but he stifled the words "to give her
lessons." The idea that she gave lessons was unpleasant to him; yet
it would mean that he would see her regularly. She left the piano
and came over to his chair.</p>

<p>"I would like, very much; but there is&mdash;June. When are they
coming back?"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon frowned. "Not till the middle of next month. What
does that matter?"</p>

<p>"You said June had forgiven me; but she could never forget,
Uncle Jolyon."</p>

<p>Forget! She must forget, if he wanted her to.</p>

<p>But as if answering, Irene shook her head. "You know she
couldn't; one doesn't forget."</p>

<p>Always that wretched past! And he said with a sort of vexed
finality:</p>

<p>"Well, we shall see."</p>

<p>He talked to her an hour or more, of the children, and a hundred
little things, till the carriage came round to take her home. And
when she had gone he went back to his chair, and sat there
smoothing his face and chin, dreaming over the day.</p>

<p>That evening after dinner he went to his study and took a sheet
of paper. He stayed for some minutes without writing, then rose and
stood under the masterpiece 'Dutch Fishing Boats at Sunset.' He was
not thinking of that picture, but of his life. He was going to
leave her something in his Will; nothing could so have stirred the
stilly deeps of thought and memory. He was going to leave her a
portion of his wealth, of his aspirations, deeds, qualities,
work&mdash;all that had made that wealth; going to leave her, too,
a part of all he had missed in life, by his sane and steady pursuit
of wealth. All! What had he missed? 'Dutch Fishing Boats' responded
blankly; he crossed to the French window, and drawing the curtain
aside, opened it. A wind had got up, and one of last year's oak
leaves which had somehow survived the gardener's brooms, was
dragging itself with a tiny clicking rustle along the stone terrace
in the twilight. Except for that it was very quiet out there, and
he could smell the heliotrope watered not long since. A bat went
by. A bird uttered its last 'cheep.' And right above the oak tree
the first star shone. Faust in the opera had bartered his soul for
some fresh years of youth. Morbid notion! No such bargain was
possible, that was real tragedy! No making oneself new again for
love or life or anything. Nothing left to do but enjoy beauty from
afar off while you could, and leave it something in your Will. But
how much? And, as if he could not make that calculation looking out
into the mild freedom of the country night, he turned back and went
up to the chimney-piece. There were his pet bronzes&mdash;a
Cleopatra with the asp at her breast; a Socrates; a greyhound
playing with her puppy; a strong man reining in some horses. 'They
last!' he thought, and a pang went through his heart. They had a
thousand years of life before them!</p>

<p>'How much?' Well! enough at all events to save her getting old
before her time, to keep the lines out of her face as long as
possible, and grey from soiling that bright hair. He might live
another five years. She would be well over thirty by then. 'How
much?' She had none of his blood in her! In loyalty to the tenor of
his life for forty years and more, ever since he married and
founded that mysterious thing, a family, came this warning
thought&mdash;None of his blood, no right to anything! It was a
luxury then, this notion. An extravagance, a petting of an old
man's whim, one of those things done in dotage. His real future was
vested in those who had his blood, in whom he would live on when he
was gone. He turned away from the bronzes and stood looking at the
old leather chair in which he had sat and smoked so many hundreds
of cigars. And suddenly he seemed to see her sitting there in her
grey dress, fragrant, soft, dark-eyed, graceful, looking up at him.
Why! She cared nothing for him, really; all she cared for was that
lost lover of hers. But she was there, whether she would or no,
giving him pleasure with her beauty and grace. One had no right to
inflict an old man's company, no right to ask her down to play to
him and let him look at her&mdash;for no reward! Pleasure must be
paid for in this world. 'How much?' After all, there was plenty;
his son and his three grandchildren would never miss that little
lump. He had made it himself, nearly every penny; he could leave it
where he liked, allow himself this little pleasure. He went back to
the bureau. 'Well, I'm going to,' he thought, 'let them think what
they like. I'm going to!' And he sat down.</p>

<p>'How much?' Ten thousand, twenty thousand&mdash;how much? If
only with his money he could buy one year, one month of youth. And
startled by that thought, he wrote quickly:</p>

<p>'DEAR HERRING,&mdash;Draw me a codicil to this effect: "I leave
to my niece Irene Forsyte, born Irene Heron, by which name she now
goes, fifteen thousand pounds free of legacy duty." 'Yours
faithfully, 'JOLYON FORSYTE.'</p>

<p>When he had sealed and stamped the envelope, he went back to the
window and drew in a long breath. It was dark, but many stars shone
now.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>He woke at half-past two, an hour which long experience had
taught him brings panic intensity to all awkward thoughts.
Experience had also taught him that a further waking at the proper
hour of eight showed the folly of such panic. On this particular
morning the thought which gathered rapid momentum was that if he
became ill, at his age not improbable, he would not see her. From
this it was but a step to realisation that he would be cut off,
too, when his son and June returned from Spain. How could he
justify desire for the company of one who had stolen&mdash;early
morning does not mince words&mdash;June's lover? That lover was
dead; but June was a stubborn little thing; warm-hearted, but
stubborn as wood, and&mdash;quite true&mdash;not one who forgot! By
the middle of next month they would be back. He had barely five
weeks left to enjoy the new interest which had come into what
remained of his life. Darkness showed up to him absurdly clear the
nature of his feeling. Admiration for beauty&mdash;a craving to see
that which delighted his eyes.</p>

<p>Preposterous, at his age! And yet&mdash;what other reason was
there for asking June to undergo such painful reminder, and how
prevent his son and his son's wife from thinking him very queer? He
would be reduced to sneaking up to London, which tired him; and the
least indisposition would cut him off even from that. He lay with
eyes open, setting his jaw against the prospect, and calling
himself an old fool, while his heart beat loudly, and then seemed
to stop beating altogether. He had seen the dawn lighting the
window chinks, heard the birds chirp and twitter, and the cocks
crow, before he fell asleep again, and awoke tired but sane. Five
weeks before he need bother, at his age an eternity! But that early
morning panic had left its mark, had slightly fevered the will of
one who had always had his own way. He would see her as often as he
wished! Why not go up to town and make that codicil at his
solicitor's instead of writing about it; she might like to go to
the opera! But, by train, for he would not have that fat chap
Beacon grinning behind his back. Servants were such fools; and, as
likely as not, they had known all the past history of Irene and
young Bosinney&mdash;servants knew everything, and suspected the
rest. He wrote to her that morning:</p>

<blockquote>"MY DEAR IRENE,&mdash;I have to be up in town
to-morrow. If you would like to have a look in at the opera, come
and dine with me quietly..."<br>
<br>
But where? It was decades since he had dined anywhere in London
save at his Club or at a private house. Ah! that new-fangled place
close to Covent Garden...<br>
<br>
"Let me have a line to-morrow morning to the Piedmont Hotel whether
to expect you there at 7 o'clock.<br>
<br>
"Yours affectionately,<br>
"JOLYON FORSYTE."</blockquote>

<p>She would understand that he just wanted to give her a little
pleasure; for the idea that she should guess he had this itch to
see her was instinctively unpleasant to him; it was not seemly that
one so old should go out of his way to see beauty, especially in a
woman.</p>

<p>The journey next day, short though it was, and the visit to his
lawyer's, tired him. It was hot too, and after dressing for dinner
he lay down on the sofa in his bedroom to rest a little. He must
have had a sort of fainting fit, for he came to himself feeling
very queer; and with some difficulty rose and rang the bell. Why!
it was past seven! And there he was and she would be waiting. But
suddenly the dizziness came on again, and he was obliged to relapse
on the sofa. He heard the maid's voice say:</p>

<p>"Did you ring, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, come here;" he could not see her clearly, for the cloud in
front of his eyes. "I'm not well, I want some sal volatile."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Her voice sounded frightened.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon made an effort.</p>

<p>"Don't go. Take this message to my niece&mdash;a lady waiting in
the hall&mdash;a lady in grey. Say Mr. Forsyte is not
well&mdash;the heat. He is very sorry; if he is not down directly,
she is not to wait dinner."</p>

<p>When she was gone, he thought feebly: 'Why did I say a lady in
grey&mdash;she may be in anything. Sal volatile!' He did not go off
again, yet was not conscious of how Irene came to be standing
beside him, holding smelling salts to his nose, and pushing a
pillow up behind his head. He heard her say anxiously: "Dear Uncle
Jolyon, what is it?" was dimly conscious of the soft pressure of
her lips on his hand; then drew a long breath of smelling salts,
suddenly discovered strength in them, and sneezed.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he said, "it's nothing. How did you get here? Go down and
dine&mdash;the tickets are on the dressing-table. I shall be all
right in a minute."</p>

<p>He felt her cool hand on his forehead, smelled violets, and sat
divided between a sort of pleasure and a determination to be all
right.</p>

<p>"Why! You are in grey!" he said. "Help me up." Once on his feet
he gave himself a shake.</p>

<p>"What business had I to go off like that!" And he moved very
slowly to the glass. What a cadaverous chap! Her voice, behind him,
murmured:</p>

<p>"You mustn't come down, Uncle; you must rest."</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks! A glass of champagne'll soon set me to rights. I
can't have you missing the opera."</p>

<p>But the journey down the corridor was troublesome. What carpets
they had in these newfangled places, so thick that you tripped up
in them at every step! In the lift he noticed how concerned she
looked, and said with the ghost of a twinkle:</p>

<p>"I'm a pretty host."</p>

<p>When the lift stopped he had to hold firmly to the seat to
prevent its slipping under him; but after soup and a glass of
champagne he felt much better, and began to enjoy an infirmity
which had brought such solicitude into her manner towards him.</p>

<p>"I should have liked you for a daughter," he said suddenly; and
watching the smile in her eyes, went on:</p>

<p>"You mustn't get wrapped up in the past at your time of life;
plenty of that when you get to my age. That's a nice dress&mdash;I
like the style."</p>

<p>"I made it myself."</p>

<p>Ah! A woman who could make herself a pretty frock had not lost
her interest in life.</p>

<p>"Make hay while the sun shines," he said; "and drink that up. I
want to see some colour in your cheeks. We mustn't waste life; it
doesn't do. There's a new Marguerite to-night; let's hope she won't
be fat. And Mephisto&mdash;anything more dreadful than a fat chap
playing the Devil I can't imagine."</p>

<p>But they did not go to the opera after all, for in getting up
from dinner the dizziness came over him again, and she insisted on
his staying quiet and going to bed early. When he parted from her
at the door of the hotel, having paid the cabman to drive her to
Chelsea, he sat down again for a moment to enjoy the memory of her
words: "You are such a darling to me, Uncle Jolyon!" Why! Who
wouldn't be! He would have liked to stay up another day and take
her to the Zoo, but two days running of him would bore her to
death. No, he must wait till next Sunday; she had promised to come
then. They would settle those lessons for Holly, if only for a
month. It would be something. That little Mam'zelle Beauce wouldn't
like it, but she would have to lump it. And crushing his old opera
hat against his chest he sought the lift.</p>

<p>He drove to Waterloo next morning, struggling with a desire to
say: 'Drive me to Chelsea.' But his sense of proportion was too
strong. Besides, he still felt shaky, and did not want to risk
another aberration like that of last night, away from home. Holly,
too, was expecting him, and what he had in his bag for her. Not
that there was any cupboard love in his little sweet&mdash;she was
a bundle of affection. Then, with the rather bitter cynicism of the
old, he wondered for a second whether it was not cupboard love
which made Irene put up with him. No, she was not that sort either.
She had, if anything, too little notion of how to butter her bread,
no sense of property, poor thing! Besides, he had not breathed a
word about that codicil, nor should he&mdash;sufficient unto the
day was the good thereof.</p>

<p>In the victoria which met him at the station Holly was
restraining the dog Balthasar, and their caresses made 'jubey' his
drive home. All the rest of that fine hot day and most of the next
he was content and peaceful, reposing in the shade, while the long
lingering sunshine showered gold on the lawns and the flowers. But
on Thursday evening at his lonely dinner he began to count the
hours; sixty-five till he would go down to meet her again in the
little coppice, and walk up through the fields at her side. He had
intended to consult the doctor about his fainting fit, but the
fellow would be sure to insist on quiet, no excitement and all
that; and he did not mean to be tied by the leg, did not want to be
told of an infirmity&mdash;if there were one, could not afford to
hear of it at his time of life, now that this new interest had
come. And he carefully avoided making any mention of it in a letter
to his son. It would only bring them back with a run! How far this
silence was due to consideration for their pleasure, how far to
regard for his own, he did not pause to consider.</p>

<p>That night in his study he had just finished his cigar and was
dozing off, when he heard the rustle of a gown, and was conscious
of a scent of violets. Opening his eyes he saw her, dressed in
grey, standing by the fireplace, holding out her arms. The odd
thing was that, though those arms seemed to hold nothing, they were
curved as if round someone's neck, and her own neck was bent back,
her lips open, her eyes closed. She vanished at once, and there
were the mantelpiece and his bronzes. But those bronzes and the
mantelpiece had not been there when she was, only the fireplace and
the wall! Shaken and troubled, he got up. 'I must take medicine,'
he thought; 'I can't be well.' His heart beat too fast, he had an
asthmatic feeling in the chest; and going to the window, he opened
it to get some air. A dog was barking far away, one of the dogs at
Gage's farm no doubt, beyond the coppice. A beautiful still night,
but dark. 'I dropped off,' he mused, 'that's it! And yet I'll swear
my eyes were open!' A sound like a sigh seemed to answer.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he said sharply, "who's there?"</p>

<p>Putting his hand to his side to still the beating of his heart,
he stepped out on the terrace. Something soft scurried by in the
dark. "Shoo!" It was that great grey cat. 'Young Bosinney was like
a great cat!' he thought. 'It was him in there, that she&mdash;that
she was&mdash;He's got her still!' He walked to the edge of the
terrace, and looked down into the darkness; he could just see the
powdering of the daisies on the unmown lawn. Here to-day and gone
to-morrow! And there came the moon, who saw all, young and old,
alive and dead, and didn't care a dump! His own turn soon. For a
single day of youth he would give what was left! And he turned
again towards the house. He could see the windows of the night
nursery up there. His little sweet would be asleep. 'Hope that dog
won't wake her!' he thought. 'What is it makes us love, and makes
us die! I must go to bed.'</p>

<p>And across the terrace stones, growing grey in the moonlight, he
passed back within.</p>

<p>How should an old man live his days if not in dreaming of his
well-spent past? In that, at all events, there is no agitating
warmth, only pale winter sunshine. The shell can withstand the
gentle beating of the dynamos of memory. The present he should
distrust; the future shun. From beneath thick shade he should watch
the sunlight creeping at his toes. If there be sun of summer, let
him not go out into it, mistaking it for the Indian-summer sun!
Thus peradventure he shall decline softly, slowly, imperceptibly,
until impatient Nature clutches his wind-pipe and he gasps away to
death some early morning before the world is aired, and they put on
his tombstone: 'In the fulness of years!' yea! If he preserve his
principles in perfect order, a Forsyte may live on long after he is
dead.</p>

<p>Old Jolyon was conscious of all this, and yet there was in him
that which transcended Forsyteism. For it is written that a Forsyte
shall not love beauty more than reason; nor his own way more than
his own health. And something beat within him in these days that
with each throb fretted at the thinning shell. His sagacity knew
this, but it knew too that he could not stop that beating, nor
would if he could. And yet, if you had told him he was living on
his capital, he would have stared you down. No, no; a man did not
live on his capital; it was not done! The shibboleths of the past
are ever more real than the actualities of the present. And he, to
whom living on one's capital had always been anathema, could not
have borne to have applied so gross a phrase to his own case.
Pleasure is healthful; beauty good to see; to live again in the
youth of the young&mdash;and what else on earth was he doing!</p>

<p>Methodically, as had been the way of his whole life, he now
arranged his time. On Tuesdays he journeyed up to town by train;
Irene came and dined with him. And they went to the opera. On
Thursdays he drove to town, and, putting that fat chap and his
horses up, met her in Kensington Gardens, picking up the carriage
after he had left her, and driving home again in time for dinner.
He threw out the casual formula that he had business in London on
those two days. On Wednesdays and Saturdays she came down to give
Holly music lessons. The greater the pleasure he took in her
society, the more scrupulously fastidious he became, just a
matter-of-fact and friendly uncle. Not even in feeling, really, was
he more&mdash;for, after all, there was his age. And yet, if she
were late he fidgeted himself to death. If she missed coming, which
happened twice, his eyes grew sad as an old dog's, and he failed to
sleep.</p>

<p>And so a month went by&mdash;a month of summer in the fields,
and in his heart, with summer's heat and the fatigue thereof. Who
could have believed a few weeks back that he would have looked
forward to his son's and his grand-daughter's return with something
like dread! There was such a delicious freedom, such recovery of
that independence a man enjoys before he founds a family, about
these weeks of lovely weather, and this new companionship with one
who demanded nothing, and remained always a little unknown,
retaining the fascination of mystery. It was like a draught of wine
to him who has been drinking water for so long that he has almost
forgotten the stir wine brings to his blood, the narcotic to his
brain. The flowers were coloured brighter, scents and music and the
sunlight had a living value&mdash;were no longer mere reminders of
past enjoyment. There was something now to live for which stirred
him continually to anticipation. He lived in that, not in
retrospection; the difference is considerable to any so old as he.
The pleasures of the table, never of much consequence to one
naturally abstemious, had lost all value. He ate little, without
knowing what he ate; and every day grew thinner and more worn to
look at. He was again a 'threadpaper'; and to this thinned form his
massive forehead, with hollows at the temples, gave more dignity
than ever. He was very well aware that he ought to see the doctor,
but liberty was too sweet. He could not afford to pet his frequent
shortness of breath and the pain in his side at the expense of
liberty. Return to the vegetable existence he had led among the
agricultural journals with the life-size mangold wurzels, before
this new attraction came into his life&mdash;no! He exceeded his
allowance of cigars. Two a day had always been his rule. Now he
smoked three and sometimes four&mdash;a man will when he is filled
with the creative spirit. But very often he thought: 'I must give
up smoking, and coffee; I must give up rattling up to town.' But he
did not; there was no one in any sort of authority to notice him,
and this was a priceless boon.</p>

<p>The servants perhaps wondered, but they were, naturally, dumb.
Mam'zelle Beauce was too concerned with her own digestion, and too
'wellbrrred' to make personal allusions. Holly had not as yet an
eye for the relative appearance of him who was her plaything and
her god. It was left for Irene herself to beg him to eat more, to
rest in the hot part of the day, to take a tonic, and so forth. But
she did not tell him that she was the a cause of his
thinness&mdash;for one cannot see the havoc oneself is working. A
man of eighty-five has no passions, but the Beauty which produces
passion works on in the old way, till death closes the eyes which
crave the sight of Her.</p>

<p>On the first day of the second week in July he received a letter
from his son in Paris to say that they would all be back on Friday.
This had always been more sure than Fate; but, with the pathetic
improvidence given to the old, that they may endure to the end, he
had never quite admitted it. Now he did, and something would have
to be done. He had ceased to be able to imagine life without this
new interest, but that which is not imagined sometimes exists, as
Forsytes are perpetually finding to their cost. He sat in his old
leather chair, doubling up the letter, and mumbling with his lips
the end of an unlighted cigar. After to-morrow his Tuesday
expeditions to town would have to be abandoned. He could still
drive up, perhaps, once a week, on the pretext of seeing his man of
business. But even that would be dependent on his health, for now
they would begin to fuss about him. The lessons! The lessons must
go on! She must swallow down her scruples, and June must put her
feelings in her pocket. She had done so once, on the day after the
news of Bosinney's death; what she had done then, she could surely
do again now. Four years since that injury was inflicted on
her&mdash;not Christian to keep the memory of old sores alive.
June's will was strong, but his was stronger, for his sands were
running out. Irene was soft, surely she would do this for him,
subdue her natural shrinking, sooner than give him pain! The
lessons must continue; for if they did, he was secure. And lighting
his cigar at last, he began trying to shape out how to put it to
them all, and explain this strange intimacy; how to veil and wrap
it away from the naked truth&mdash;that he could not bear to be
deprived of the sight of beauty. Ah! Holly! Holly was fond of her,
Holly liked her lessons. She would save him&mdash;his little sweet!
And with that happy thought he became serene, and wondered what he
had been worrying about so fearfully. He must not worry, it left
him always curiously weak, and as if but half present in his own
body.</p>

<p>That evening after dinner he had a return of the dizziness,
though he did not faint. He would not ring the bell, because he
knew it would mean a fuss, and make his going up on the morrow more
conspicuous. When one grew old, the whole world was in conspiracy
to limit freedom, and for what reason?&mdash;just to keep the
breath in him a little longer. He did not want it at such cost.
Only the dog Balthasar saw his lonely recovery from that weakness;
anxiously watched his master go to the sideboard and drink some
brandy, instead of giving him a biscuit. When at last old Jolyon
felt able to tackle the stairs he went up to bed. And, though still
shaky next morning, the thought of the evening sustained and
strengthened him. It was always such a pleasure to give her a good
dinner&mdash;he suspected her of undereating when she was alone;
and, at the opera to watch her eyes glow and brighten, the
unconscious smiling of her lips. She hadn't much pleasure, and this
was the last time he would be able to give her that treat. But when
he was packing his bag he caught himself wishing that he had not
the fatigue of dressing for dinner before him, and the exertion,
too, of telling her about June's return.</p>

<p>The opera that evening was 'Carmen,' and he chose the last
entr'acte to break the news, instinctively putting it off till the
latest moment.</p>

<p>She took it quietly, queerly; in fact, he did not know how she
had taken it before the wayward music lifted up again and silence
became necessary. The mask was down over her face, that mask behind
which so much went on that he could not see. She wanted time to
think it over, no doubt! He would not press her, for she would be
coming to give her lesson to-morrow afternoon, and he should see
her then when she had got used to the idea. In the cab he talked
only of the Carmen; he had seen better in the old days, but this
one was not bad at all. When he took her hand to say good-night,
she bent quickly forward and kissed his forehead.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, dear Uncle Jolyon, you have been so sweet to me."</p>

<p>"To-morrow then," he said. "Good-night. Sleep well." She echoed
softly: "Sleep well," and from the cab window, already moving away,
he saw her face screwed round towards him, and her hand put out in
a gesture which seemed to linger.</p>

<p>He sought his room slowly. They never gave him the same, and he
could not get used to these 'spick-and-spandy' bedrooms with new
furniture and grey-green carpets sprinkled all over with pink
roses. He was wakeful and that wretched Habanera kept throbbing in
his head.</p>

<p>His French had never been equal to its words, but its sense he
knew, if it had any sense, a gipsy thing&mdash;wild and
unaccountable. Well, there was in life something which upset all
your care and plans&mdash;something which made men and women dance
to its pipes. And he lay staring from deep-sunk eyes into the
darkness where the unaccountable held sway. You thought you had
hold of life, but it slipped away behind you, took you by the
scruff of the neck, forced you here and forced you there, and then,
likely as not, squeezed life out of you! It took the very stars
like that, he shouldn't wonder, rubbed their noses together and
flung them apart; it had never done playing its pranks. Five
million people in this great blunderbuss of a town, and all of them
at the mercy of that Life-Force, like a lot of little dried peas
hopping about on a board when you struck your fist on it. Ah, well!
Himself would not hop much longer&mdash;a good long sleep would do
him good!</p>

<p>How hot it was up here!&mdash;how noisy! His forehead burned;
she had kissed it just where he always worried; just there&mdash;as
if she had known the very place and wanted to kiss it all away for
him. But, instead, her lips left a patch of grievous uneasiness.
She had never spoken in quite that voice, had never before made
that lingering gesture or looked back at him as she drove away.</p>

<p>He got out of bed and pulled the curtains aside; his room faced
down over the river. There was little air, but the sight of that
breadth of water flowing by, calm, eternal, soothed him. 'The great
thing,' he thought 'is not to make myself a nuisance. I'll think of
my little sweet, and go to sleep.' But it was long before the heat
and throbbing of the London night died out into the short slumber
of the summer morning. And old Jolyon had but forty winks.</p>

<p>When he reached home next day he went out to the flower garden,
and with the help of Holly, who was very delicate with flowers,
gathered a great bunch of carnations. They were, he told her, for
'the lady in grey'&mdash;a name still bandied between them; and he
put them in a bowl in his study where he meant to tackle Irene the
moment she came, on the subject of June and future lessons. Their
fragrance and colour would help. After lunch he lay down, for he
felt very tired, and the carriage would not bring her from the
station till four o'clock. But as the hour approached he grew
restless, and sought the schoolroom, which overlooked the drive.
The sun-blinds were down, and Holly was there with Mademoiselle
Beauce, sheltered from the heat of a stifling July day, attending
to their silkworms. Old Jolyon had a natural antipathy to these
methodical creatures, whose heads and colour reminded him of
elephants; who nibbled such quantities of holes in nice green
leaves; and smelled, as he thought, horrid. He sat down on a
chintz-covered windowseat whence he could see the drive, and get
what air there was; and the dog Balthasar who appreciated chintz on
hot days, jumped up beside him. Over the cottage piano a violet
dust-sheet, faded almost to grey, was spread, and on it the first
lavender, whose scent filled the room. In spite of the coolness
here, perhaps because of that coolness the beat of life vehemently
impressed his ebbed-down senses. Each sunbeam which came through
the chinks had annoying brilliance; that dog smelled very strong;
the lavender perfume was overpowering; those silkworms heaving up
their grey-green backs seemed horribly alive; and Holly's dark head
bent over them had a wonderfully silky sheen. A marvellous cruelly
strong thing was life when you were old and weak; it seemed to mock
you with its multitude of forms and its beating vitality. He had
never, till those last few weeks, had this curious feeling of being
with one half of him eagerly borne along in the stream of life, and
with the other half left on the bank, watching that helpless
progress. Only when Irene was with him did he lose this double
consciousness.</p>

<p>Holly turned her head, pointed with her little brown fist to the
piano&mdash;for to point with a finger was not
'well-brrred'&mdash;and said slyly:</p>

<p>"Look at the 'lady in grey,' Gran; isn't she pretty to-day?"</p>

<p>Old Jolyon's heart gave a flutter, and for a second the room was
clouded; then it cleared, and he said with a twinkle:</p>

<p>"Who's been dressing her up?"</p>

<p>"Mam'zelle."</p>

<p>"Hollee! Don't be foolish!"</p>

<p>That prim little Frenchwoman! She hadn't yet got over the music
lessons being taken away from her. That wouldn't help. His little
sweet was the only friend they had. Well, they were her lessons.
And he shouldn't budge shouldn't budge for anything. He stroked the
warm wool on Balthasar's head, and heard Holly say: "When mother's
home, there won't be any changes, will there? She doesn't like
strangers, you know."</p>

<p>The child's words seemed to bring the chilly atmosphere of
opposition about old Jolyon, and disclose all the menace to his
new-found freedom. Ah! He would have to resign himself to being an
old man at the mercy of care and love, or fight to keep this new
and prized companionship; and to fight tired him to death. But his
thin, worn face hardened into resolution till it appeared all Jaw.
This was his house, and his affair; he should not budge! He looked
at his watch, old and thin like himself; he had owned it fifty
years. Past four already! And kissing the top of Holly's head in
passing, he went down to the hall. He wanted to get hold of her
before she went up to give her lesson. At the first sound of wheels
he stepped out into the porch, and saw at once that the victoria
was empty.</p>

<p>"The train's in, sir; but the lady 'asn't come."</p>

<p>Old Jolyon gave him a sharp upward look, his eyes seemed to push
away that fat chap's curiosity, and defy him to see the bitter
disappointment he was feeling.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, and turned back into the house. He went to
his study and sat down, quivering like a leaf. What did this mean?
She might have lost her train, but he knew well enough she hadn't.
'Good-bye, dear Uncle Jolyon.' Why 'Good-bye' and not 'Good-night'?
And that hand of hers lingering in the air. And her kiss. What did
it mean? Vehement alarm and irritation took possession of him. He
got up and began to pace the Turkey carpet, between window and
wall. She was going to give him up! He felt it for
certain&mdash;and he defenceless. An old man wanting to look on
beauty! It was ridiculous! Age closed his mouth, paralysed his
power to fight. He had no right to what was warm and living, no
right to anything but memories and sorrow. He could not plead with
her; even an old man has his dignity. Defenceless! For an hour,
lost to bodily fatigue, he paced up and down, past the bowl of
carnations he had plucked, which mocked him with its scent. Of all
things hard to bear, the prostration of will-power is hardest, for
one who has always had his way. Nature had got him in its net, and
like an unhappy fish he turned and swam at the meshes, here and
there, found no hole, no breaking point. They brought him tea at
five o'clock, and a letter. For a moment hope beat up in him. He
cut the envelope with the butter knife, and read:</p>

<blockquote>"DEAREST UNCLE JOLYON,&mdash;I can't bear to write
anything that may disappoint you, but I was too cowardly to tell
you last night. I feel I can't come down and give Holly any more
lessons, now that June is coming back. Some things go too deep to
be forgotten. It has been such a joy to see you and Holly. Perhaps
I shall still see you sometimes when you come up, though I'm sure
it's not good for you; I can see you are tiring yourself too much.
I believe you ought to rest quite quietly all this hot weather, and
now you have your son and June coming back you will be so happy.
Thank you a million times for all your sweetness to me.<br>
<br>
"Lovingly your IRENE."</blockquote>

<p>So, there it was! Not good for him to have pleasure and what he
chiefly cared about; to try and put off feeling the inevitable end
of all things, the approach of death with its stealthy, rustling
footsteps. Not good for him! Not even she could see how she was his
new lease of interest in life, the incarnation of all the beauty he
felt slipping from him.</p>

<p>His tea grew cold, his cigar remained unlit; and up and down he
paced, torn between his dignity and his hold on life. Intolerable
to be squeezed out slowly, without a say of your own, to live on
when your will was in the hands of others bent on weighing you to
the ground with care and love. Intolerable! He would see what
telling her the truth would do&mdash;the truth that he wanted the
sight of her more than just a lingering on. He sat down at his old
bureau and took a pen. But he could not write. There was something
revolting in having to plead like this; plead that she should warm
his eyes with her beauty. It was tantamount to confessing dotage.
He simply could not. And instead, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>"I had hoped that the memory of old sores would not be
allowed to stand in the way of what is a pleasure and a profit to
me and my little grand-daughter. But old men learn to forego their
whims; they are obliged to, even the whim to live must be foregone
sooner or later; and perhaps the sooner the better.<br>
<br>
"My love to you,<br>
<br>
"JOLYON FORSYTE."</blockquote>

<p>'Bitter,' he thought, 'but I can't help it. I'm tired.' He
sealed and dropped it into the box for the evening post, and
hearing it fall to the bottom, thought: 'There goes all I've looked
forward to!'</p>

<p>That evening after dinner which he scarcely touched, after his
cigar which he left half-smoked for it made him feel faint, he went
very slowly upstairs and stole into the night-nursery. He sat down
on the window-seat. A night-light was burning, and he could just
see Holly's face, with one hand underneath the cheek. An early
cockchafer buzzed in the Japanese paper with which they had filled
the grate, and one of the horses in the stable stamped restlessly.
To sleep like that child! He pressed apart two rungs of the
venetian blind and looked out. The moon was rising, blood-red. He
had never seen so red a moon. The woods and fields out there were
dropping to sleep too, in the last glimmer of the summer light. And
beauty, like a spirit, walked. 'I've had a long life,' he thought,
'the best of nearly everything. I'm an ungrateful chap; I've seen a
lot of beauty in my time. Poor young Bosinney said I had a sense of
beauty. There's a man in the moon to-night!' A moth went by,
another, another. 'Ladies in grey!' He closed his eyes. A feeling
that he would never open them again beset him; he let it grow, let
himself sink; then, with a shiver, dragged the lids up. There was
something wrong with him, no doubt, deeply wrong; he would have to
have the doctor after all. It didn't much matter now! Into that
coppice the moon-light would have crept; there would be shadows,
and those shadows would be the only things awake. No birds, beasts,
flowers, insects; Just the shadows &mdash;moving; 'Ladies in grey!'
Over that log they would climb; would whisper together. She and
Bosinney! Funny thought! And the frogs and little things would
whisper too! How the clock ticked, in here! It was all
eerie&mdash;out there in the light of that red moon; in here with
the little steady night-light and, the ticking clock and the
nurse's dressing-gown hanging from the edge of the screen, tall,
like a woman's figure. 'Lady in grey!' And a very odd thought beset
him: Did she exist? Had she ever come at all? Or was she but the
emanation of all the beauty he had loved and must leave so soon?
The violet-grey spirit with the dark eyes and the crown of amber
hair, who walks the dawn and the moonlight, and at blue-bell time?
What was she, who was she, did she exist? He rose and stood a
moment clutching the window-sill, to give him a sense of reality
again; then began tiptoeing towards the door. He stopped at the
foot of the bed; and Holly, as if conscious of his eyes fixed on
her, stirred, sighed, and curled up closer in defence. He tiptoed
on and passed out into the dark passage; reached his room,
undressed at once, and stood before a mirror in his night-shirt.
What a scarecrow&mdash;with temples fallen in, and thin legs! His
eyes resisted his own image, and a look of pride came on his face.
All was in league to pull him down, even his reflection in the
glass, but he was not down&mdash;yet! He got into bed, and lay a
long time without sleeping, trying to reach resignation, only too
well aware that fretting and disappointment were very bad for
him.</p>

<p>He woke in the morning so unrefreshed and strengthless that he
sent for the doctor. After sounding him, the fellow pulled a face
as long as your arm, and ordered him to stay in bed and give up
smoking. That was no hardship; there was nothing to get up for, and
when he felt ill, tobacco always lost its savour. He spent the
morning languidly with the sun-blinds down, turning and re-turning
The Times, not reading much, the dog Balthasar lying beside his
bed. With his lunch they brought him a telegram, running thus:</p>

<p>'Your letter received coming down this afternoon will be with
you at four-thirty. Irene.'</p>

<p>Coming down! After all! Then she did exist&mdash;and he was not
deserted. Coming down! A glow ran through his limbs; his cheeks and
forehead felt hot. He drank his soup, and pushed the tray-table
away, lying very quiet until they had removed lunch and left him
alone; but every now and then his eyes twinkled. Coming down! His
heart beat fast, and then did not seem to beat at all. At three
o'clock he got up and dressed deliberately, noiselessly. Holly and
Mam'zelle would be in the schoolroom, and the servants asleep after
their dinner, he shouldn't wonder. He opened his door cautiously,
and went downstairs. In the hall the dog Balthasar lay solitary,
and, followed by him, old Jolyon passed into his study and out into
the burning afternoon. He meant to go down and meet her in the
coppice, but felt at once he could not manage that in this heat. He
sat down instead under the oak tree by the swing, and the dog
Balthasar, who also felt the heat, lay down beside him. He sat
there smiling. What a revel of bright minutes! What a hum of
insects, and cooing of pigeons! It was the quintessence of a summer
day. Lovely! And he was happy&mdash;happy as a sand-boy, whatever
that might be. She was coming; she had not given him up! He had
everything in life he wanted&mdash;except a little more breath, and
less weight&mdash;just here! He would see her when she emerged from
the fernery, come swaying just a little, a violet-grey figure
passing over the daisies and dandelions and 'soldiers' on the
lawn&mdash;the soldiers with their flowery crowns. He would not
move, but she would come up to him and say: 'Dear Uncle Jolyon, I
am sorry!' and sit in the swing and let him look at her and tell
her that he had not been very well but was all right now; and that
dog would lick her hand. That dog knew his master was fond of her;
that dog was a good dog.</p>

<p>It was quite shady under the tree; the sun could not get at him,
only make the rest of the world bright so that he could see the
Grand Stand at Epsom away out there, very far, and the cows
cropping the clover in the field and swishing at the flies with
their tails. He smelled the scent of limes, and lavender. Ah! that
was why there was such a racket of bees. They were
excited&mdash;busy, as his heart was busy and excited. Drowsy, too,
drowsy and drugged on honey and happiness; as his heart was drugged
and drowsy. Summer&mdash;summer&mdash;they seemed saying; great
bees and little bees, and the flies too!</p>

<p>The stable clock struck four; in half an hour she would be here.
He would have just one tiny nap, because he had had so little sleep
of late; and then he would be fresh for her, fresh for youth and
beauty, coming towards him across the sunlit lawn&mdash;lady in
grey! And settling back in his chair he closed his eyes. Some
thistle-down came on what little air there was, and pitched on his
moustache more white than itself. He did not know; but his
breathing stirred it, caught there. A ray of sunlight struck
through and lodged on his boot. A bumble-bee alighted and strolled
on the crown of his Panama hat. And the delicious surge of slumber
reached the brain beneath that hat, and the head swayed forward and
rested on his breast. Summer&mdash;summer! So went the hum.</p>

<p>The stable clock struck the quarter past. The dog Balthasar
stretched and looked up at his master. The thistledown no longer
moved. The dog placed his chin over the sunlit foot. It did not
stir. The dog withdrew his chin quickly, rose, and leaped on old
Jolyon's lap, looked in his face, whined; then, leaping down, sat
on his haunches, gazing up. And suddenly he uttered a long, long
howl.</p>

<p>But the thistledown was still as death, and the face of his old
master.</p>

<p>Summer&mdash;summer&mdash;summer! The soundless footsteps on the
grass! 1917</p>

<h3>PART I</h3>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER I&mdash;AT TIMOTHY'S</h3>

<p>The possessive instinct never stands still. Through florescence
and feud, frosts and fires, it followed the laws of progression
even in the Forsyte family which had believed it fixed for ever.
Nor can it be dissociated from environment any more than the
quality of potato from the soil.</p>

<p>The historian of the English eighties and nineties will, in his
good time, depict the somewhat rapid progression from
self-contented and contained provincialism to still more
self-contented if less contained imperialism&mdash;in other words,
the 'possessive' instinct of the nation on the move. And so, as if
in conformity, was it with the Forsyte family. They were spreading
not merely on the surface, but within.</p>

<p>When, in 1895, Susan Hayman, the married Forsyte sister,
followed her husband at the ludicrously low age of seventy-four,
and was cremated, it made strangely little stir among the six old
Forsytes left. For this apathy there were three causes. First: the
almost surreptitious burial of old Jolyon in 1892 down at Robin
Hill&mdash;first of the Forsytes to desert the family grave at
Highgate. That burial, coming a year after Swithin's entirely
proper funeral, had occasioned a great deal of talk on Forsyte
'Change, the abode of Timothy Forsyte on the Bayswater Road,
London, which still collected and radiated family gossip. Opinions
ranged from the lamentation of Aunt Juley to the outspoken
assertion of Francie that it was 'a jolly good thing to stop all
that stuffy Highgate business.' Uncle Jolyon in his later
years&mdash;indeed, ever since the strange and lamentable affair
between his granddaughter June's lover, young Bosinney, and Irene,
his nephew Soames Forsyte's wife&mdash;had noticeably rapped the
family's knuckles; and that way of his own which he had always
taken had begun to seem to them a little wayward. The philosophic
vein in him, of course, had always been too liable to crop out of
the strata of pure Forsyteism, so they were in a way prepared for
his interment in a strange spot. But the whole thing was an odd
business, and when the contents of his Will became current coin on
Forsyte 'Change, a shiver had gone round the clan. Out of his
estate (L145,304 gross, with liabilities L35 7s. 4d.) he had
actually left L15,000 to "whomever do you think, my dear? To
Irene!" that runaway wife of his nephew Soames; Irene, a woman who
had almost disgraced the family, and&mdash;still more amazing was
to him no blood relation. Not out and out, of course; only a life
interest&mdash;only the income from it! Still, there it was; and
old Jolyon's claim to be the perfect Forsyte was ended once for
all. That, then, was the first reason why the burial of Susan
Hayman&mdash;at Woking&mdash;made little stir.</p>

<p>The second reason was altogether more expansive and imperial.
Besides the house on Campden Hill, Susan had a place (left her by
Hayman when he died) just over the border in Hants, where the
Hayman boys had learned to be such good shots and riders, as it was
believed, which was of course nice for them, and creditable to
everybody; and the fact of owning something really countrified
seemed somehow to excuse the dispersion of her remains&mdash;though
what could have put cremation into her head they could not think!
The usual invitations, however, had been issued, and Soames had
gone down and young Nicholas, and the Will had been quite
satisfactory so far as it went, for she had only had a life
interest; and everything had gone quite smoothly to the children in
equal shares.</p>

<p>The third reason why Susan's burial made little stir was the
most expansive of all. It was summed up daringly by Euphemia, the
pale, the thin: "Well, I think people have a right to their own
bodies, even when they're dead." Coming from a daughter of
Nicholas, a Liberal of the old school and most tyrannical, it was a
startling remark&mdash;showing in a flash what a lot of water had
run under bridges since the death of Aunt Ann in '86, just when the
proprietorship of Soames over his wife's body was acquiring the
uncertainty which had led to such disaster. Euphemia, of course,
spoke like a child, and had no experience; for though well over
thirty by now, her name was still Forsyte. But, making all
allowances, her remark did undoubtedly show expansion of the
principle of liberty, decentralisation and shift in the central
point of possession from others to oneself. When Nicholas heard his
daughter's remark from Aunt Hester he had rapped out: "Wives and
daughters! There's no end to their liberty in these days. I knew
that 'Jackson' case would lead to things&mdash;lugging in Habeas
Corpus like that!" He had, of course, never really forgiven the
Married Woman's Property Act, which would so have interfered with
him if he had not mercifully married before it was passed. But, in
truth, there was no denying the revolt among the younger Forsytes
against being owned by others; that, as it were, Colonial
disposition to own oneself, which is the paradoxical forerunner of
Imperialism, was making progress all the time. They were all now
married, except George, confirmed to the Turf and the Iseeum Club;
Francie, pursuing her musical career in a studio off the King's
Road, Chelsea, and still taking 'lovers' to dances; Euphemia,
living at home and complaining of Nicholas; and those two Dromios,
Giles and Jesse Hayman. Of the third generation there were not very
many&mdash;young Jolyon had three, Winifred Dartie four, young
Nicholas six already, young Roger had one, Marian Tweetyman one;
St. John Hayman two. But the rest of the sixteen
married&mdash;Soames, Rachel and Cicely of James' family; Eustace
and Thomas of Roger's; Ernest, Archibald and Florence of Nicholas';
Augustus and Annabel Spender of the Hayman's&mdash;were going down
the years unreproduced.</p>

<p>Thus, of the ten old Forsytes twenty-one young Forsytes had been
born; but of the twenty-one young Forsytes there were as yet only
seventeen descendants; and it already seemed unlikely that there
would be more than a further unconsidered trifle or so. A student
of statistics must have noticed that the birth rate had varied in
accordance with the rate of interest for your money. Grandfather
'Superior Dosset' Forsyte in the early nineteenth century had been
getting ten per cent. for his, hence ten children. Those ten,
leaving out the four who had not married, and Juley, whose husband
Septimus Small had, of course, died almost at once, had averaged
from four to five per cent. for theirs, and produced accordingly.
The twenty-one whom they produced were now getting barely three per
cent. in the Consols to which their father had mostly tied the
Settlements they made to avoid death duties, and the six of them
who had been reproduced had seventeen children, or just the proper
two and five-sixths per stem.</p>

<p>There were other reasons, too, for this mild reproduction. A
distrust of their earning powers, natural where a sufficiency is
guaranteed, together with the knowledge that their fathers did not
die, kept them cautious. If one had children and not much income,
the standard of taste and comfort must of necessity go down; what
was enough for two was not enough for four, and so on&mdash;it
would be better to wait and see what Father did. Besides, it was
nice to be able to take holidays unhampered. Sooner in fact than
own children, they preferred to concentrate on the ownership of
themselves, conforming to the growing tendency fin de siecle, as it
was called. In this way, little risk was run, and one would be able
to have a motor-car. Indeed, Eustace already had one, but it had
shaken him horribly, and broken one of his eye teeth; so that it
would be better to wait till they were a little safer. In the
meantime, no more children! Even young Nicholas was drawing in his
horns, and had made no addition to his six for quite three
years.</p>

<p>The corporate decay, however, of the Forsytes, their dispersion
rather, of which all this was symptomatic, had not advanced so far
as to prevent a rally when Roger Forsyte died in 1899. It had been
a glorious summer, and after holidays abroad and at the sea they
were practically all back in London, when Roger with a touch of his
old originality had suddenly breathed his last at his own house in
Princes Gardens. At Timothy's it was whispered sadly that poor
Roger had always been eccentric about his digestion&mdash;had he
not, for instance, preferred German mutton to all the other
brands?</p>

<p>Be that as it may, his funeral at Highgate had been perfect, and
coming away from it Soames Forsyte made almost mechanically for his
Uncle Timothy's in the Bayswater Road. The 'Old Things'&mdash;Aunt
Juley and Aunt Hester&mdash;would like to hear about it. His
father&mdash;James&mdash;at eighty-eight had not felt up to the
fatigue of the funeral; and Timothy himself, of course, had not
gone; so that Nicholas had been the only brother present. Still,
there had been a fair gathering; and it would cheer Aunts Juley and
Hester up to know. The kindly thought was not unmixed with the
inevitable longing to get something out of everything you do, which
is the chief characteristic of Forsytes, and indeed of the saner
elements in every nation. In this practice of taking family matters
to Timothy's in the Bayswater Road, Soames was but following in the
footsteps of his father, who had been in the habit of going at
least once a week to see his sisters at Timothy's, and had only
given it up when he lost his nerve at eighty-six, and could not go
out without Emily. To go with Emily was of no use, for who could
really talk to anyone in the presence of his own wife? Like James
in the old days, Soames found time to go there nearly every Sunday,
and sit in the little drawing-room into which, with his undoubted
taste, he had introduced a good deal of change and china not quite
up to his own fastidious mark, and at least two rather doubtful
Barbizon pictures, at Christmastides. He himself, who had done
extremely well with the Barbizons, had for some years past moved
towards the Marises, Israels, and Mauve, and was hoping to do
better. In the riverside house which he now inhabited near
Mapledurham he had a gallery, beautifully hung and lighted, to
which few London dealers were strangers. It served, too, as a
Sunday afternoon attraction in those week-end parties which his
sisters, Winifred or Rachel, occasionally organised for him. For
though he was but a taciturn showman, his quiet collected
determinism seldom failed to influence his guests, who knew that
his reputation was grounded not on mere aesthetic fancy, but on his
power of gauging the future of market values. When he went to
Timothy's he almost always had some little tale of triumph over a
dealer to unfold, and dearly he loved that coo of pride with which
his aunts would greet it. This afternoon, however, he was
differently animated, coming from Roger's funeral in his neat dark
clothes&mdash;not quite black, for after all an uncle was but an
uncle, and his soul abhorred excessive display of feeling. Leaning
back in a marqueterie chair and gazing down his uplifted nose at
the sky-blue walls plastered with gold frames, he was noticeably
silent. Whether because he had been to a funeral or not, the
peculiar Forsyte build of his face was seen to the best advantage
this afternoon&mdash;a face concave and long, with a jaw which
divested of flesh would have seemed extravagant: altogether a
chinny face though not at all ill-looking. He was feeling more
strongly than ever that Timothy's was hopelessly 'rum-ti-too' and
the souls of his aunts dismally mid-Victorian. The subject on which
alone he wanted to talk&mdash;his own undivorced position&mdash;was
unspeakable. And yet it occupied his mind to the exclusion of all
else. It was only since the Spring that this had been so and a new
feeling grown up which was egging him on towards what he knew might
well be folly in a Forsyte of forty-five. More and more of late he
had been conscious that he was 'getting on.' The fortune already
considerable when he conceived the house at Robin Hill which had
finally wrecked his marriage with Irene, had mounted with
surprising vigour in the twelve lonely years during which he had
devoted himself to little else. He was worth to-day well over a
hundred thousand pounds, and had no one to leave it to&mdash;no
real object for going on with what was his religion. Even if he
were to relax his efforts, money made money, and he felt that he
would have a hundred and fifty thousand before he knew where he
was. There had always been a strongly domestic, philoprogenitive
side to Soames; baulked and frustrated, it had hidden itself away,
but now had crept out again in this his 'prime of life.' Concreted
and focussed of late by the attraction of a girl's undoubted
beauty, it had become a veritable prepossession.</p>

<p>And this girl was French, not likely to lose her head, or accept
any unlegalised position. Moreover, Soames himself disliked the
thought of that. He had tasted of the sordid side of sex during
those long years of forced celibacy, secretively, and always with
disgust, for he was fastidious, and his sense of law and order
innate. He wanted no hole and corner liaison. A marriage at the
Embassy in Paris, a few months' travel, and he could bring Annette
back quite separated from a past which in truth was not too
distinguished, for she only kept the accounts in her mother's Soho
Restaurant; he could bring her back as something very new and chic
with her French taste and self-possession, to reign at 'The
Shelter' near Mapledurham. On Forsyte 'Change and among his
riverside friends it would be current that he had met a charming
French girl on his travels and married her. There would be the
flavour of romance, and a certain cachet about a French wife. No!
He was not at all afraid of that. It was only this cursed
undivorced condition of his, and&mdash;and the question whether
Annette would take him, which he dared not put to the touch until
he had a clear and even dazzling future to offer her.</p>

<p>In his aunts' drawing-room he heard with but muffled ears those
usual questions: How was his dear father? Not going out, of course,
now that the weather was turning chilly? Would Soames be sure to
tell him that Hester had found boiled holly leaves most comforting
for that pain in her side; a poultice every three hours, with red
flannel afterwards. And could he relish just a little pot of their
very best prune preserve&mdash;it was so delicious this year, and
had such a wonderful effect. Oh! and about the Darties&mdash;had
Soames heard that dear Winifred was having a most distressing time
with Montague? Timothy thought she really ought to have protection
It was said&mdash;but Soames mustn't take this for
certain&mdash;that he had given some of Winifred's jewellery to a
dreadful dancer. It was such a bad example for dear Val just as he
was going to college. Soames had not heard? Oh, but he must go and
see his sister and look into it at once! And did he think these
Boers were really going to resist? Timothy was in quite a stew
about it. The price of Consols was so high, and he had such a lot
of money in them. Did Soames think they must go down if there was a
war? Soames nodded. But it would be over very quickly. It would be
so bad for Timothy if it wasn't. And of course Soames' dear father
would feel it very much at his age. Luckily poor dear Roger had
been spared this dreadful anxiety. And Aunt Juley with a little
handkerchief wiped away the large tear trying to climb the
permanent pout on her now quite withered left cheek; she was
remembering dear Roger, and all his originality, and how he used to
stick pins into her when they were little together. Aunt Hester,
with her instinct for avoiding the unpleasant, here chimed in: Did
Soames think they would make Mr. Chamberlain Prime Minister at
once? He would settle it all so quickly. She would like to see that
old Kruger sent to St. Helena. She could remember so well the news
of Napoleon's death, and what a relief it had been to his
grandfather. Of course she and Juley&mdash;"We were in pantalettes
then, my dear"&mdash;had not felt it much at the time.</p>

<p>Soames took a cup of tea from her, drank it quickly, and ate
three of those macaroons for which Timothy's was famous. His faint,
pale, supercilious smile had deepened just a little. Really, his
family remained hopelessly provincial, however much of London they
might possess between them. In these go-ahead days their
provincialism stared out even more than it used to. Why, old
Nicholas was still a Free Trader, and a member of that antediluvian
home of Liberalism, the Remove Club&mdash;though, to be sure, the
members were pretty well all Conservatives now, or he himself could
not have joined; and Timothy, they said, still wore a nightcap.
Aunt Juley spoke again. Dear Soames was looking so well, hardly a
day older than he did when dear Ann died, and they were all there
together, dear Jolyon, and dear Swithin, and dear Roger. She paused
and caught the tear which had climbed the pout on her right cheek.
Did he&mdash;did he ever hear anything of Irene nowadays? Aunt
Hester visibly interposed her shoulder. Really, Juley was always
saying something! The smile left Soames' face, and he put his cup
down. Here was his subject broached for him, and for all his desire
to expand, he could not take advantage.</p>

<p>Aunt Juley went on rather hastily:</p>

<p>"They say dear Jolyon first left her that fifteen thousand out
and out; then of course he saw it would not be right, and made it
for her life only."</p>

<p>Had Soames heard that?</p>

<p>Soames nodded.</p>

<p>"Your cousin Jolyon is a widower now. He is her trustee; you
knew that, of course?"</p>

<p>Soames shook his head. He did know, but wished to show no
interest. Young Jolyon and he had not met since the day of
Bosinney's death.</p>

<p>"He must be quite middle-aged by now," went on Aunt Juley
dreamily. "Let me see, he was born when your dear uncle lived in
Mount Street; long before they went to Stanhope Gate in December.
Just before that dreadful Commune. Over fifty! Fancy that! Such a
pretty baby, and we were all so proud of him; the very first of you
all." Aunt Juley sighed, and a lock of not quite her own hair came
loose and straggled, so that Aunt Hester gave a little shiver.
Soames rose, he was experiencing a curious piece of self-discovery.
That old wound to his pride and self-esteem was not yet closed. He
had come thinking he could talk of it, even wanting to talk of his
fettered condition, and&mdash;behold! he was shrinking away from
this reminder by Aunt Juley, renowned for her Malapropisms.</p>

<p>Oh, Soames was not going already!</p>

<p>Soames smiled a little vindictively, and said:</p>

<p>"Yes. Good-bye. Remember me to Uncle Timothy!" And, leaving a
cold kiss on each forehead, whose wrinkles seemed to try and cling
to his lips as if longing to be kissed away, he left them looking
brightly after him&mdash;dear Soames, it had been so good of him to
come to-day, when they were not feeling very...!</p>

<p>With compunction tweaking at his chest Soames descended the
stairs, where was always that rather pleasant smell of camphor and
port wine, and house where draughts are not permitted. The poor old
things&mdash;he had not meant to be unkind! And in the street he
instantly forgot them, repossessed by the image of Annette and the
thought of the cursed coil around him. Why had he not pushed the
thing through and obtained divorce when that wretched Bosinney was
run over, and there was evidence galore for the asking! And he
turned towards his sister Winifred Dartie's residence in Green
Street, Mayfair.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II&mdash;EXIT A MAN OF THE WORLD</h3>

<p>That a man of the world so subject to the vicissitudes of
fortunes as Montague Dartie should still be living in a house he
had inhabited twenty years at least would have been more noticeable
if the rent, rates, taxes, and repairs of that house had not been
defrayed by his father-in-law. By that simple if wholesale device
James Forsyte had secured a certain stability in the lives of his
daughter and his grandchildren. After all, there is something
invaluable about a safe roof over the head of a sportsman so
dashing as Dartie. Until the events of the last few days he had
been almost-supernaturally steady all this year. The fact was he
had acquired a half share in a filly of George Forsyte's, who had
gone irreparably on the turf, to the horror of Roger, now stilled
by the grave. Sleeve-links, by Martyr, out of Shirt-on-fire, by
Suspender, was a bay filly, three years old, who for a variety of
reasons had never shown her true form. With half ownership of this
hopeful animal, all the idealism latent somewhere in Dartie, as in
every other man, had put up its head, and kept him quietly ardent
for months past. When a man has some thing good to live for it is
astonishing how sober he becomes; and what Dartie had was really
good&mdash;a three to one chance for an autumn handicap, publicly
assessed at twenty-five to one. The old-fashioned heaven was a poor
thing beside it, and his shirt was on the daughter of
Shirt-on-fire. But how much more than his shirt depended on this
granddaughter of Suspender! At that roving age of forty-five,
trying to Forsytes&mdash;and, though perhaps less distinguishable
from any other age, trying even to Darties&mdash;Montague had fixed
his current fancy on a dancer. It was no mean passion, but without
money, and a good deal of it, likely to remain a love as airy as
her skirts; and Dartie never had any money, subsisting miserably on
what he could beg or borrow from Winifred&mdash;a woman of
character, who kept him because he was the father of her children,
and from a lingering admiration for those now-dying Wardour Street
good looks which in their youth had fascinated her. She, together
with anyone else who would lend him anything, and his losses at
cards and on the turf (extraordinary how some men make a good thing
out of losses!) were his whole means of subsistence; for James was
now too old and nervous to approach, and Soames too formidably
adamant. It is not too much to say that Dartie had been living on
hope for months. He had never been fond of money for itself, had
always despised the Forsytes with their investing habits, though
careful to make such use of them as he could. What he liked about
money was what it bought&mdash;personal sensation.</p>

<p>"No real sportsman cares for money," he would say, borrowing a
'pony' if it was no use trying for a 'monkey.' There was something
delicious about Montague Dartie. He was, as George Forsyte said, a
'daisy.'</p>

<p>The morning of the Handicap dawned clear and bright, the last
day of September, and Dartie who had travelled to Newmarket the
night before, arrayed himself in spotless checks and walked to an
eminence to see his half of the filly take her final canter: If she
won he would be a cool three thou. in pocket&mdash;a poor enough
recompense for the sobriety and patience of these weeks of hope,
while they had been nursing her for this race. But he had not been
able to afford more. Should he 'lay it off' at the eight to one to
which she had advanced? This was his single thought while the larks
sang above him, and the grassy downs smelled sweet, and the pretty
filly passed, tossing her head and glowing like satin.</p>

<p>After all, if he lost it would not be he who paid, and to 'lay
it off' would reduce his winnings to some fifteen
hundred&mdash;hardly enough to purchase a dancer out and out. Even
more potent was the itch in the blood of all the Darties for a real
flutter. And turning to George he said: "She's a clipper. She'll
win hands down; I shall go the whole hog." George, who had laid off
every penny, and a few besides, and stood to win, however it came
out, grinned down on him from his bulky height, with the words: "So
ho, my wild one!" for after a chequered apprenticeship weathered
with the money of a deeply complaining Roger, his Forsyte blood was
beginning to stand him in good stead in the profession of
owner.</p>

<p>There are moments of disillusionment in the lives of men from
which the sensitive recorder shrinks. Suffice it to say that the
good thing fell down. Sleeve-links finished in the ruck. Dartie's
shirt was lost.</p>

<p>Between the passing of these things and the day when Soames
turned his face towards Green Street, what had not happened!</p>

<p>When a man with the constitution of Montague Dartie has
exercised self-control for months from religious motives, and
remains unrewarded, he does not curse God and die, he curses God
and lives, to the distress of his family.</p>

<p>Winifred&mdash;a plucky woman, if a little too
fashionable&mdash;who had borne the brunt of him for exactly
twenty-one years, had never really believed that he would do what
he now did. Like so many wives, she thought she knew the worst, but
she had not yet known him in his forty-fifth year, when he, like
other men, felt that it was now or never. Paying on the 2nd of
October a visit of inspection to her jewel case, she was horrified
to observe that her woman's crown and glory was gone&mdash;the
pearls which Montague had given her in '86, when Benedict was born,
and which James had been compelled to pay for in the spring of '87,
to save scandal. She consulted her husband at once. He
'pooh-poohed' the matter. They would turn up! Nor till she said
sharply: "Very well, then, Monty, I shall go down to Scotland Yard
myself," did he consent to take the matter in hand. Alas! that the
steady and resolved continuity of design necessary to the
accomplishment of sweeping operations should be liable to
interruption by drink. That night Dartie returned home without a
care in the world or a particle of reticence. Under normal
conditions Winifred would merely have locked her door and let him
sleep it off, but torturing suspense about her pearls had caused
her to wait up for him. Taking a small revolver from his pocket and
holding on to the dining table, he told her at once that he did not
care a cursh whether she lived s'long as she was quiet; but he
himself wash tired o' life. Winifred, holding onto the other side
of the dining table, answered:</p>

<p>"Don't be a clown, Monty. Have you been to Scotland Yard?"</p>

<p>Placing the revolver against his chest, Dartie had pulled the
trigger several times. It was not loaded. Dropping it with an
imprecation, he had muttered: "For shake o' the children," and sank
into a chair. Winifred, having picked up the revolver, gave him
some soda water. The liquor had a magical effect. Life had illused
him; Winifred had never 'unshtood'm.' If he hadn't the right to
take the pearls he had given her himself, who had? That Spanish
filly had got'm. If Winifred had any 'jection he w'd
cut&mdash;her&mdash;throat. What was the matter with that?
(Probably the first use of that celebrated phrase&mdash;so obscure
are the origins of even the most classical language!)</p>

<p>Winifred, who had learned self-containment in a hard school,
looked up at him, and said: "Spanish filly! Do you mean that girl
we saw dancing in the Pandemonium Ballet? Well, you are a thief and
a blackguard." It had been the last straw on a sorely loaded
consciousness; reaching up from his chair Dartie seized his wife's
arm, and recalling the achievements of his boyhood, twisted it.
Winifred endured the agony with tears in her eyes, but no murmur.
Watching for a moment of weakness, she wrenched it free; then
placing the dining table between them, said between her teeth: "You
are the limit, Monty." (Undoubtedly the inception of that
phrase&mdash;so is English formed under the stress of
circumstances.) Leaving Dartie with foam on his dark moustache she
went upstairs, and, after locking her door and bathing her arm in
hot water, lay awake all night, thinking of her pearls adorning the
neck of another, and of the consideration her husband had
presumably received therefor.</p>

<p>The man of the world awoke with a sense of being lost to that
world, and a dim recollection of having been called a 'limit.' He
sat for half an hour in the dawn and the armchair where he had
slept&mdash;perhaps the unhappiest half-hour he had ever spent, for
even to a Dartie there is something tragic about an end. And he
knew that he had reached it. Never again would he sleep in his
dining-room and wake with the light filtering through those
curtains bought by Winifred at Nickens and Jarveys with the money
of James. Never again eat a devilled kidney at that rose-wood
table, after a roll in the sheets and a hot bath. He took his note
case from his dress coat pocket. Four hundred pounds, in fives and
tens&mdash;the remainder of the proceeds of his half of
Sleeve-links, sold last night, cash down, to George Forsyte, who,
having won over the race, had not conceived the sudden dislike to
the animal which he himself now felt. The ballet was going to
Buenos Aires the day after to-morrow, and he was going too. Full
value for the pearls had not yet been received; he was only at the
soup.</p>

<p>He stole upstairs. Not daring to have a bath, or shave (besides,
the water would be cold), he changed his clothes and packed
stealthily all he could. It was hard to leave so many shining
boots, but one must sacrifice something. Then, carrying a valise in
either hand, he stepped out onto the landing. The house was very
quiet&mdash;that house where he had begotten his four children. It
was a curious moment, this, outside the room of his wife, once
admired, if not perhaps loved, who had called him 'the limit.' He
steeled himself with that phrase, and tiptoed on; but the next door
was harder to pass. It was the room his daughters slept in. Maud
was at school, but Imogen would be lying there; and moisture came
into Dartie's early morning eyes. She was the most like him of the
four, with her dark hair, and her luscious brown glance. Just
coming out, a pretty thing! He set down the two valises. This
almost formal abdication of fatherhood hurt him. The morning light
fell on a face which worked with real emotion. Nothing so false as
penitence moved him; but genuine paternal feeling, and that
melancholy of 'never again.' He moistened his lips; and complete
irresolution for a moment paralysed his legs in their check
trousers. It was hard&mdash;hard to be thus compelled to leave his
home! "D&mdash;&mdash;nit!" he muttered, "I never thought it would
come to this." Noises above warned him that the maids were
beginning to get up. And grasping the two valises, he tiptoed on
downstairs. His cheeks were wet, and the knowledge of that was
comforting, as though it guaranteed the genuineness of his
sacrifice. He lingered a little in the rooms below, to pack all the
cigars he had, some papers, a crush hat, a silver cigarette box, a
Ruff's Guide. Then, mixing himself a stiff whisky and soda, and
lighting a cigarette, he stood hesitating before a photograph of
his two girls, in a silver frame. It belonged to Winifred. 'Never
mind,' he thought; 'she can get another taken, and I can't!' He
slipped it into the valise. Then, putting on his hat and overcoat,
he took two others, his best malacca cane, an umbrella, and opened
the front door. Closing it softly behind him, he walked out,
burdened as he had never been in all his life, and made his way
round the corner to wait there for an early cab to come by.</p>

<p>Thus had passed Montague Dartie in the forty-fifth year of his
age from the house which he had called his own.</p>

<p>When Winifred came down, and realised that he was not in the
house, her first feeling was one of dull anger that he should thus
elude the reproaches she had carefully prepared in those long
wakeful hours. He had gone off to Newmarket or Brighton, with that
woman as likely as not. Disgusting! Forced to a complete reticence
before Imogen and the servants, and aware that her father's nerves
would never stand the disclosure, she had been unable to refrain
from going to Timothy's that afternoon, and pouring out the story
of the pearls to Aunts Juley and Hester in utter confidence. It was
only on the following morning that she noticed the disappearance of
that photograph. What did it mean? Careful examination of her
husband's relics prompted the thought that he had gone for good. As
that conclusion hardened she stood quite still in the middle of his
dressing-room, with all the drawers pulled out, to try and realise
what she was feeling. By no means easy! Though he was 'the limit'
he was yet her property, and for the life of her she could not but
feel the poorer. To be widowed yet not widowed at forty-two; with
four children; made conspicuous, an object of commiseration! Gone
to the arms of a Spanish Jade! Memories, feelings, which she had
thought quite dead, revived within her, painful, sullen, tenacious.
Mechanically she closed drawer after drawer, went to her bed, lay
on it, and buried her face in the pillows. She did not cry. What
was the use of that? When she got off her bed to go down to lunch
she felt as if only one thing could do her good, and that was to
have Val home. He&mdash;her eldest boy&mdash;who was to go to
Oxford next month at James' expense, was at Littlehampton taking
his final gallops with his trainer for Smalls, as he would have
phrased it following his father's diction. She caused a telegram to
be sent to him.</p>

<p>"I must see about his clothes," she said to Imogen; "I can't
have him going up to Oxford all anyhow. Those boys are so
particular."</p>

<p>"Val's got heaps of things," Imogen answered.</p>

<p>"I know; but they want overhauling. I hope he'll come."</p>

<p>"He'll come like a shot, Mother. But he'll probably skew his
Exam."</p>

<p>"I can't help that," said Winifred. "I want him."</p>

<p>With an innocent shrewd look at her mother's face, Imogen kept
silence. It was father, of course! Val did come 'like a shot' at
six o'clock.</p>

<p>Imagine a cross between a pickle and a Forsyte and you have
young Publius Valerius Dartie. A youth so named could hardly turn
out otherwise. When he was born, Winifred, in the heyday of
spirits, and the craving for distinction, had determined that her
children should have names such as no others had ever had. (It was
a mercy&mdash;she felt now&mdash;that she had just not named Imogen
Thisbe.) But it was to George Forsyte, always a wag, that Val's
christening was due. It so happened that Dartie, dining with him a
week after the birth of his son and heir, had mentioned this
aspiration of Winifred's.</p>

<p>"Call him Cato," said George, "it'll be damned piquant!" He had
just won a tenner on a horse of that name.</p>

<p>"Cato!" Dartie had replied&mdash;they were a little 'on' as the
phrase was even in those days&mdash;"it's not a Christian
name."</p>

<p>"Halo you!" George called to a waiter in knee breeches. "Bring
me the Encyc'pedia Brit. from the Library, letter C."</p>

<p>The waiter brought it.</p>

<p>"Here you are!" said George, pointing with his cigar: "Cato
Publius Valerius by Virgil out of Lydia. That's what you want.
Publius Valerius is Christian enough."</p>

<p>Dartie, on arriving home, had informed Winifred. She had been
charmed. It was so 'chic.' And Publius Valerius became the baby's
name, though it afterwards transpired that they had got hold of the
inferior Cato. In 1890, however, when little Publius was nearly
ten, the word 'chic' went out of fashion, and sobriety came in;
Winifred began to have doubts. They were confirmed by little
Publius himself who returned from his first term at school
complaining that life was a burden to him&mdash;they called him
Pubby. Winifred&mdash;a woman of real decision&mdash;promptly
changed his school and his name to Val, the Publius being dropped
even as an initial.</p>

<p>At nineteen he was a limber, freckled youth with a wide mouth,
light eyes, long dark lashes; a rather charming smile, considerable
knowledge of what he should not know, and no experience of what he
ought to do. Few boys had more narrowly escaped being
expelled&mdash;the engaging rascal. After kissing his mother and
pinching Imogen, he ran upstairs three at a time, and came down
four, dressed for dinner. He was awfully sorry, but his 'trainer,'
who had come up too, had asked him to dine at the Oxford and
Cambridge; it wouldn't do to miss&mdash;the old chap would be hurt.
Winifred let him go with an unhappy pride. She had wanted him at
home, but it was very nice to know that his tutor was so fond of
him. He went out with a wink at Imogen, saying: "I say, Mother,
could I have two plover's eggs when I come in?&mdash;cook's got
some. They top up so jolly well. Oh! and look here&mdash;have you
any money?&mdash;I had to borrow a fiver from old Snobby."</p>

<p>Winifred, looking at him with fond shrewdness, answered:</p>

<p>"My dear, you are naughty about money. But you shouldn't pay him
to-night, anyway; you're his guest. How nice and slim he looked in
his white waistcoat, and his dark thick lashes!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but we may go to the theatre, you see, Mother; and I think
I ought to stand the tickets; he's always hard up, you know."</p>

<p>Winifred produced a five-pound note, saying:</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you'd better pay him, but you mustn't stand the
tickets too."</p>

<p>Val pocketed the fiver.</p>

<p>"If I do, I can't," he said. "Good-night, Mum!"</p>

<p>He went out with his head up and his hat cocked joyously,
sniffing the air of Piccadilly like a young hound loosed into
covert. Jolly good biz! After that mouldy old slow hole down
there!</p>

<p>He found his 'tutor,' not indeed at the Oxford and Cambridge,
but at the Goat's Club. This 'tutor' was a year older than himself,
a good-looking youth, with fine brown eyes, and smooth dark hair, a
small mouth, an oval face, languid, immaculate, cool to a degree,
one of those young men who without effort establish moral
ascendancy over their companions. He had missed being expelled from
school a year before Val, had spent that year at Oxford, and Val
could almost see a halo round his head. His name was Crum, and no
one could get through money quicker. It seemed to be his only aim
in life&mdash;dazzling to young Val, in whom, however, the Forsyte
would stand apart, now and then, wondering where the value for that
money was.</p>

<p>They dined quietly, in style and taste; left the Club smoking
cigars, with just two bottles inside them, and dropped into stalls
at the Liberty. For Val the sound of comic songs, the sight of
lovely legs were fogged and interrupted by haunting fears that he
would never equal Crum's quiet dandyism. His idealism was roused;
and when that is so, one is never quite at ease. Surely he had too
wide a mouth, not the best cut of waistcoat, no braid on his
trousers, and his lavender gloves had no thin black stitchings down
the back. Besides, he laughed too much&mdash;Crum never laughed, he
only smiled, with his regular dark brows raised a little so that
they formed a gable over his just drooped lids. No! he would never
be Crum's equal. All the same it was a jolly good show, and Cynthia
Dark simply ripping. Between the acts Crum regaled him with
particulars of Cynthia's private life, and the awful knowledge
became Val's that, if he liked, Crum could go behind. He simply
longed to say: "I say, take me!" but dared not, because of his
deficiencies; and this made the last act or two almost miserable.
On coming out Crum said: "It's half an hour before they close;
let's go on to the Pandemonium." They took a hansom to travel the
hundred yards, and seats costing seven-and-six apiece because they
were going to stand, and walked into the Promenade. It was in these
little things, this utter negligence of money that Crum had such
engaging polish. The ballet was on its last legs and night, and the
traffic of the Promenade was suffering for the moment. Men and
women were crowded in three rows against the barrier. The whirl and
dazzle on the stage, the half dark, the mingled tobacco fumes and
women's scent, all that curious lure to promiscuity which belongs
to Promenades, began to free young Val from his idealism. He looked
admiringly in a young woman's face, saw she was not young, and
quickly looked away. Shades of Cynthia Dark! The young woman's arm
touched his unconsciously; there was a scent of musk and
mignonette. Val looked round the corner of his lashes. Perhaps she
was young, after all. Her foot trod on his; she begged his pardon.
He said:</p>

<p>"Not at all; jolly good ballet, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm tired of it; aren't you?"</p>

<p>Young Val smiled&mdash;his wide, rather charming smile. Beyond
that he did not go&mdash;not yet convinced. The Forsyte in him
stood out for greater certainty. And on the stage the ballet
whirled its kaleidoscope of snow-white, salmon-pink, and
emerald-green and violet and seemed suddenly to freeze into a
stilly spangled pyramid. Applause broke out, and it was over!
Maroon curtains had cut it off. The semi-circle of men and women
round the barrier broke up, the young woman's arm pressed his. A
little way off disturbance seemed centring round a man with a pink
carnation; Val stole another glance at the young woman, who was
looking towards it. Three men, unsteady, emerged, walking arm in
arm. The one in the centre wore the pink carnation, a white
waistcoat, a dark moustache; he reeled a little as he walked.
Crum's voice said slow and level: "Look at that bounder, he's
screwed!" Val turned to look. The 'bounder' had disengaged his arm,
and was pointing straight at them. Crum's voice, level as ever,
said:</p>

<p>"He seems to know you!" The 'bounder' spoke:</p>

<p>"H'llo!" he said. "You f'llows, look! There's my young rascal of
a son!"</p>

<p>Val saw. It was his father! He could have sunk into the crimson
carpet. It was not the meeting in this place, not even that his
father was 'screwed'; it was Crum's word 'bounder,' which, as by
heavenly revelation, he perceived at that moment to be true. Yes,
his father looked a bounder with his dark good looks, and his pink
carnation, and his square, self-assertive walk. And without a word
he ducked behind the young woman and slipped out of the Promenade.
He heard the word, "Val!" behind him, and ran down deep-carpeted
steps past the 'chuckersout,' into the Square.</p>

<p>To be ashamed of his own father is perhaps the bitterest
experience a young man can go through. It seemed to Val, hurrying
away, that his career had ended before it had begun. How could he
go up to Oxford now amongst all those chaps, those splendid friends
of Crum's, who would know that his father was a 'bounder'! And
suddenly he hated Crum. Who the devil was Crum, to say that? If
Crum had been beside him at that moment, he would certainly have
been jostled off the pavement. His own father&mdash;his own! A
choke came up in his throat, and he dashed his hands down deep into
his overcoat pockets. Damn Crum! He conceived the wild idea of
running back and fending his father, taking him by the arm and
walking about with him in front of Crum; but gave it up at once and
pursued his way down Piccadilly. A young woman planted herself
before him. "Not so angry, darling!" He shied, dodged her, and
suddenly became quite cool. If Crum ever said a word, he would
jolly well punch his head, and there would be an end of it. He
walked a hundred yards or more, contented with that thought, then
lost its comfort utterly. It wasn't simple like that! He remembered
how, at school, when some parent came down who did not pass the
standard, it just clung to the fellow afterwards. It was one of
those things nothing could remove. Why had his mother married his
father, if he was a 'bounder'? It was bitterly unfair&mdash;jolly
low-down on a fellow to give him a 'bounder' for father. The worst
of it was that now Crum had spoken the word, he realised that he
had long known subconsciously that his father was not 'the clean
potato.' It was the beastliest thing that had ever happened to
him&mdash;beastliest thing that had ever happened to any fellow!
And, down-hearted as he had never yet been, he came to Green
Street, and let himself in with a smuggled latch-key. In the
dining-room his plover's eggs were set invitingly, with some cut
bread and butter, and a little whisky at the bottom of a
decanter&mdash;just enough, as Winifred had thought, for him to
feel himself a man. It made him sick to look at them, and he went
upstairs.</p>

<p>Winifred heard him pass, and thought: 'The dear boy's in. Thank
goodness! If he takes after his father I don't know what I shall
do! But he won't he's like me. Dear Val!'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III&mdash;SOAMES PREPARES TO TAKE STEPS</h3>

<p>When Soames entered his sister's little Louis Quinze
drawing-room, with its small balcony, always flowered with hanging
geraniums in the summer, and now with pots of Lilium Auratum, he
was struck by the immutability of human affairs. It looked just the
same as on his first visit to the newly married Darties twenty-one
years ago. He had chosen the furniture himself, and so completely
that no subsequent purchase had ever been able to change the room's
atmosphere. Yes, he had founded his sister well, and she had wanted
it. Indeed, it said a great deal for Winifred that after all this
time with Dartie she remained well-founded. From the first Soames
had nosed out Dartie's nature from underneath the plausibility,
savoir faire, and good looks which had dazzled Winifred, her
mother, and even James, to the extent of permitting the fellow to
marry his daughter without bringing anything but shares of no value
into settlement.</p>

<p>Winifred, whom he noticed next to the furniture, was sitting at
her Buhl bureau with a letter in her hand. She rose and came
towards him. Tall as himself, strong in the cheekbones, well
tailored, something in her face disturbed Soames. She crumpled the
letter in her hand, but seemed to change her mind and held it out
to him. He was her lawyer as well as her brother.</p>

<p>Soames read, on Iseeum Club paper, these words:</p>

<blockquote>'You will not get chance to insult in my own again. I
am leaving country to-morrow. It's played out. I'm tired of being
insulted by you. You've brought on yourself. No self-respecting man
can stand it. I shall not ask you for anything again. Good-bye. I
took the photograph of the two girls. Give them my love. I don't
care what your family say. It's all their doing. I'm going to live
new life. 'M.D.'</blockquote>

<p>This after-dinner note had a splotch on it not yet quite dry. He
looked at Winifred&mdash;the splotch had clearly come from her; and
he checked the words: 'Good riddance!' Then it occurred to him that
with this letter she was entering that very state which he himself
so earnestly desired to quit&mdash;the state of a Forsyte who was
not divorced.</p>

<p>Winifred had turned away, and was taking a long sniff from a
little gold-topped bottle. A dull commiseration, together with a
vague sense of injury, crept about Soames' heart. He had come to
her to talk of his own position, and get sympathy, and here was she
in the same position, wanting of course to talk of it, and get
sympathy from him. It was always like that! Nobody ever seemed to
think that he had troubles and interests of his own. He folded up
the letter with the splotch inside, and said:</p>

<p>"What's it all about, now?"</p>

<p>Winifred recited the story of the pearls calmly.</p>

<p>"Do you think he's really gone, Soames? You see the state he was
in when he wrote that."</p>

<p>Soames who, when he desired a thing, placated Providence by
pretending that he did not think it likely to happen, answered:</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think so. I might find out at his Club."</p>

<p>"If George is there," said Winifred, "he would know."</p>

<p>"George?" said Soames; "I saw him at his father's funeral."</p>

<p>"Then he's sure to be there."</p>

<p>Soames, whose good sense applauded his sister's acumen, said
grudgingly: "Well, I'll go round. Have you said anything in Park
Lane?"</p>

<p>"I've told Emily," returned Winifred, who retained that 'chic'
way of describing her mother. "Father would have a fit."</p>

<p>Indeed, anything untoward was now sedulously kept from James.
With another look round at the furniture, as if to gauge his
sister's exact position, Soames went out towards Piccadilly. The
evening was drawing in&mdash;a touch of chill in the October haze.
He walked quickly, with his close and concentrated air. He must get
through, for he wished to dine in Soho. On hearing from the hall
porter at the Iseeum that Mr. Dartie had not been in to-day, he
looked at the trusty fellow and decided only to ask if Mr. George
Forsyte was in the Club. He was. Soames, who always looked askance
at his cousin George, as one inclined to jest at his expense,
followed the pageboy, slightly reassured by the thought that George
had just lost his father. He must have come in for about thirty
thousand, besides what he had under that settlement of Roger's,
which had avoided death duty. He found George in a bow-window,
staring out across a half-eaten plate of muffins. His tall, bulky,
black-clothed figure loomed almost threatening, though preserving
still the supernatural neatness of the racing man. With a faint
grin on his fleshy face, he said:</p>

<p>"Hallo, Soames! Have a muffin?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," murmured Soames; and, nursing his hat, with the
desire to say something suitable and sympathetic, added:</p>

<p>"How's your mother?"</p>

<p>"Thanks," said George; "so-so. Haven't seen you for ages. You
never go racing. How's the City?"</p>

<p>Soames, scenting the approach of a jest, closed up, and
answered:</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you about Dartie. I hear he's..."</p>

<p>"Flitted, made a bolt to Buenos Aires with the fair Lola. Good
for Winifred and the little Darties. He's a treat."</p>

<p>Soames nodded. Naturally inimical as these cousins were, Dartie
made them kin.</p>

<p>"Uncle James'll sleep in his bed now," resumed George; "I
suppose he's had a lot off you, too."</p>

<p>Soames smiled.</p>

<p>"Ah! You saw him further," said George amicably. "He's a real
rouser. Young Val will want a bit of looking after. I was always
sorry for Winifred. She's a plucky woman."</p>

<p>Again Soames nodded. "I must be getting back to her," he said;
"she just wanted to know for certain. We may have to take steps. I
suppose there's no mistake?"</p>

<p>"It's quite O.K.," said George&mdash;it was he who invented so
many of those quaint sayings which have been assigned to other
sources. "He was drunk as a lord last night; but he went off all
right this morning. His ship's the Tuscarora;" and, fishing out a
card, he read mockingly:</p>

<p>"'Mr. Montague Dartie, Poste Restante, Buenos Aires.' I should
hurry up with the steps, if I were you. He fairly fed me up last
night."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Soames; "but it's not always easy." Then, conscious
from George's eyes that he had roused reminiscence of his own
affair, he got up, and held out his hand. George rose too.</p>

<p>"Remember me to Winifred...You'll enter her for the Divorce
Stakes straight off if you ask me."</p>

<p>Soames took a sidelong look back at him from the doorway. George
had seated himself again and was staring before him; he looked big
and lonely in those black clothes. Soames had never known him so
subdued. 'I suppose he feels it in a way,' he thought. 'They must
have about fifty thousand each, all told. They ought to keep the
estate together. If there's a war, house property will go down.
Uncle Roger was a good judge, though.' And the face of Annette rose
before him in the darkening street; her brown hair and her blue
eyes with their dark lashes, her fresh lips and cheeks, dewy and
blooming in spite of London, her perfect French figure. 'Take
steps!' he thought. Re-entering Winifred's house he encountered
Val, and they went in together. An idea had occurred to Soames. His
cousin Jolyon was Irene's trustee, the first step would be to go
down and see him at Robin Hill. Robin Hill! The odd&mdash;the very
odd feeling those words brought back! Robin Hill&mdash;the house
Bosinney had built for him and Irene&mdash;the house they had never
lived in&mdash;the fatal house! And Jolyon lived there now! H'm!
And suddenly he thought: 'They say he's got a boy at Oxford! Why
not take young Val down and introduce them! It's an excuse! Less
bald&mdash;very much less bald!' So, as they went upstairs, he said
to Val:</p>

<p>"You've got a cousin at Oxford; you've never met him. I should
like to take you down with me to-morrow to where he lives and
introduce you. You'll find it useful."</p>

<p>Val, receiving the idea with but moderate transports, Soames
clinched it.</p>

<p>"I'll call for you after lunch. It's in the country&mdash;not
far; you'll enjoy it."</p>

<p>On the threshold of the drawing-room he recalled with an effort
that the steps he contemplated concerned Winifred at the moment,
not himself.</p>

<p>Winifred was still sitting at her Buhl bureau.</p>

<p>"It's quite true," he said; "he's gone to Buenos Aires, started
this morning&mdash;we'd better have him shadowed when he lands.
I'll cable at once. Otherwise we may have a lot of expense. The
sooner these things are done the better. I'm always regretting that
I didn't..." he stopped, and looked sidelong at the silent
Winifred. "By the way," he went on, "can you prove cruelty?"</p>

<p>Winifred said in a dull voice:</p>

<p>"I don't know. What is cruelty?"</p>

<p>"Well, has he struck you, or anything?"</p>

<p>Winifred shook herself, and her jaw grew square.</p>

<p>"He twisted my arm. Or would pointing a pistol count? Or being
too drunk to undress himself, or&mdash;No&mdash;I can't bring in
the children."</p>

<p>"No," said Soames; "no! I wonder! Of course, there's legal
separation&mdash;we can get that. But separation! Um!"</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" asked Winifred desolately.</p>

<p>"That he can't touch you, or you him; you're both of you married
and unmarried." And again he grunted. What was it, in fact, but his
own accursed position, legalised! No, he would not put her into
that!</p>

<p>"It must be divorce," he said decisively; "failing cruelty,
there's desertion. There's a way of shortening the two years, now.
We get the Court to give us restitution of conjugal rights. Then if
he doesn't obey, we can bring a suit for divorce in six months'
time. Of course you don't want him back. But they won't know that.
Still, there's the risk that he might come. I'd rather try
cruelty."</p>

<p>Winifred shook her head. "It's so beastly."</p>

<p>"Well," Soames murmured, "perhaps there isn't much risk so long
as he's infatuated and got money. Don't say anything to anybody,
and don't pay any of his debts."</p>

<p>Winifred sighed. In spite of all she had been through, the sense
of loss was heavy on her. And this idea of not paying his debts any
more brought it home to her as nothing else yet had. Some richness
seemed to have gone out of life. Without her husband, without her
pearls, without that intimate sense that she made a brave show
above the domestic whirlpool, she would now have to face the world.
She felt bereaved indeed.</p>

<p>And into the chilly kiss he placed on her forehead, Soames put
more than his usual warmth.</p>

<p>"I have to go down to Robin Hill to-morrow," he said, "to see
young Jolyon on business. He's got a boy at Oxford. I'd like to
take Val with me and introduce him. Come down to 'The Shelter' for
the week-end and bring the children. Oh! by the way, no, that won't
do; I've got some other people coming." So saying, he left her and
turned towards Soho.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER IV&mdash;SOHO</h3>

<p>Of all quarters in the queer adventurous amalgam called London,
Soho is perhaps least suited to the Forsyte spirit. 'So-ho, my wild
one!' George would have said if he had seen his cousin going there.
Untidy, full of Greeks, Ishmaelites, cats, Italians, tomatoes,
restaurants, organs, coloured stuffs, queer names, people looking
out of upper windows, it dwells remote from the British Body
Politic. Yet has it haphazard proprietary instincts of its own, and
a certain possessive prosperity which keeps its rents up when those
of other quarters go down. For long years Soames' acquaintanceship
with Soho had been confined to its Western bastion, Wardour Street.
Many bargains had he picked up there. Even during those seven years
at Brighton after Bosinney's death and Irene's flight, he had
bought treasures there sometimes, though he had no place to put
them; for when the conviction that his wife had gone for good at
last became firm within him, he had caused a board to be put up in
Montpellier Square:</p>

<blockquote>FOR SALE<br>
THE LEASE OF THIS DESIRABLE RESIDENCE<br>
<br>
Enquire of Messrs. Lesson and Tukes,<br>
Court Street, Belgravia.</blockquote>

<p>It had sold within a week&mdash;that desirable residence, in the
shadow of whose perfection a man and a woman had eaten their hearts
out.</p>

<p>Of a misty January evening, just before the board was taken
down, Soames had gone there once more, and stood against the Square
railings, looking at its unlighted windows, chewing the cud of
possessive memories which had turned so bitter in the mouth. Why
had she never loved him? Why? She had been given all she had
wanted, and in return had given him, for three long years, all he
had wanted&mdash;except, indeed, her heart. He had uttered a little
involuntary groan, and a passing policeman had glanced suspiciously
at him who no longer possessed the right to enter that green door
with the carved brass knocker beneath the board 'For Sale!' A
choking sensation had attacked his throat, and he had hurried away
into the mist. That evening he had gone to Brighton to live...</p>

<p>Approaching Malta Street, Soho, and the Restaurant Bretagne,
where Annette would be drooping her pretty shoulders over her
accounts, Soames thought with wonder of those seven years at
Brighton. How had he managed to go on so long in that town devoid
of the scent of sweetpeas, where he had not even space to put his
treasures? True, those had been years with no time at all for
looking at them&mdash;years of almost passionate money-making,
during which Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte had become solicitors to
more limited Companies than they could properly attend to. Up to
the City of a morning in a Pullman car, down from the City of an
evening in a Pullman car. Law papers again after dinner, then the
sleep of the tired, and up again next morning. Saturday to Monday
was spent at his Club in town&mdash;curious reversal of customary
procedure, based on the deep and careful instinct that while
working so hard he needed sea air to and from the station twice a
day, and while resting must indulge his domestic affections. The
Sunday visit to his family in Park Lane, to Timothy's, and to Green
Street; the occasional visits elsewhere had seemed to him as
necessary to health as sea air on weekdays. Even since his
migration to Mapledurham he had maintained those habits
until&mdash;he had known Annette.</p>

<p>Whether Annette had produced the revolution in his outlook, or
that outlook had produced Annette, he knew no more than we know
where a circle begins. It was intricate and deeply involved with
the growing consciousness that property without anyone to leave it
to is the negation of true Forsyteism. To have an heir, some
continuance of self, who would begin where he left
off&mdash;ensure, in fact, that he would not leave off&mdash;had
quite obsessed him for the last year and more. After buying a bit
of Wedgwood one evening in April, he had dropped into Malta Street
to look at a house of his father's which had been turned into a
restaurant&mdash;a risky proceeding, and one not quite in
accordance with the terms of the lease. He had stared for a little
at the outside painted a good cream colour, with two peacock-blue
tubs containing little bay-trees in a recessed doorway&mdash;and at
the words 'Restaurant Bretagne' above them in gold letters, rather
favourably impressed. Entering, he had noticed that several people
were already seated at little round green tables with little pots
of fresh flowers on them and Brittany-ware plates, and had asked of
a trim waitress to see the proprietor. They had shown him into a
back room, where a girl was sitting at a simple bureau covered with
papers, and a small round, table was laid for two. The impression
of cleanliness, order, and good taste was confirmed when the girl
got up, saying, "You wish to see Maman, Monsieur?" in a broken
accent.</p>

<p>"Yes," Soames had answered, "I represent your landlord; in fact,
I'm his son."</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, sir, please? Tell Maman to come to this
gentleman."</p>

<p>He was pleased that the girl seemed impressed, because it showed
business instinct; and suddenly he noticed that she was remarkably
pretty&mdash;so remarkably pretty that his eyes found a difficulty
in leaving her face. When she moved to put a chair for him, she
swayed in a curious subtle way, as if she had been put together by
someone with a special secret skill; and her face and neck, which
was a little bared, looked as fresh as if they had been sprayed
with dew. Probably at this moment Soames decided that the lease had
not been violated; though to himself and his father he based the
decision on the efficiency of those illicit adaptations in the
building, on the signs of prosperity, and the obvious business
capacity of Madame Lamotte. He did not, however, neglect to leave
certain matters to future consideration, which had necessitated
further visits, so that the little back room had become quite
accustomed to his spare, not unsolid, but unobtrusive figure, and
his pale, chinny face with clipped moustache and dark hair not yet
grizzling at the sides.</p>

<p>"Un Monsieur tres distingue," Madame Lamotte found him; and
presently, "Tres amical, tres gentil," watching his eyes upon her
daughter.</p>

<p>She was one of those generously built, fine-faced, dark-haired
Frenchwomen, whose every action and tone of voice inspire perfect
confidence in the thoroughness of their domestic tastes, their
knowledge of cooking, and the careful increase of their bank
balances.</p>

<p>After those visits to the Restaurant Bretagne began, other
visits ceased&mdash;without, indeed, any definite decision, for
Soames, like all Forsytes, and the great majority of their
countrymen, was a born empiricist. But it was this change in his
mode of life which had gradually made him so definitely conscious
that he desired to alter his condition from that of the unmarried
married man to that of the married man remarried.</p>

<p>Turning into Malta Street on this evening of early October,
1899, he bought a paper to see if there were any after-development
of the Dreyfus case&mdash;a question which he had always found
useful in making closer acquaintanceship with Madame Lamotte and
her daughter, who were Catholic and anti-Dreyfusard.</p>

<p>Scanning those columns, Soames found nothing French, but noticed
a general fall on the Stock Exchange and an ominous leader about
the Transvaal. He entered, thinking: 'War's a certainty. I shall
sell my consols.' Not that he had many, personally, the rate of
interest was too wretched; but he should advise his
Companies&mdash;consols would assuredly go down. A look, as he
passed the doorways of the restaurant, assured him that business
was good as ever, and this, which in April would have pleased him,
now gave him a certain uneasiness. If the steps which he had to
take ended in his marrying Annette, he would rather see her mother
safely back in France, a move to which the prosperity of the
Restaurant Bretagne might become an obstacle. He would have to buy
them out, of course, for French people only came to England to make
money; and it would mean a higher price. And then that peculiar
sweet sensation at the back of his throat, and a slight thumping
about the heart, which he always experienced at the door of the
little room, prevented his thinking how much it would cost.</p>

<p>Going in, he was conscious of an abundant black skirt vanishing
through the door into the restaurant, and of Annette with her hands
up to her hair. It was the attitude in which of all others he
admired her&mdash;so beautifully straight and rounded and supple.
And he said:</p>

<p>"I just came in to talk to your mother about pulling down that
partition. No, don't call her."</p>

<p>"Monsieur will have supper with us? It will be ready in ten
minutes." Soames, who still held her hand, was overcome by an
impulse which surprised him.</p>

<p>"You look so pretty to-night," he said, "so very pretty. Do you
know how pretty you look, Annette?"</p>

<p>Annette withdrew her hand, and blushed. "Monsieur is very
good."</p>

<p>"Not a bit good," said Soames, and sat down gloomily.</p>

<p>Annette made a little expressive gesture with her hands; a smile
was crinkling her red lips untouched by salve.</p>

<p>And, looking at those lips, Soames said:</p>

<p>"Are you happy over here, or do you want to go back to
France?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I like London. Paris, of course. But London is better than
Orleans, and the English country is so beautiful. I have been to
Richmond last Sunday."</p>

<p>Soames went through a moment of calculating struggle.
Mapledurham! Dared he? After all, dared he go so far as that, and
show her what there was to look forward to! Still! Down there one
could say things. In this room it was impossible.</p>

<p>"I want you and your mother," he said suddenly, "to come for the
afternoon next Sunday. My house is on the river, it's not too late
in this weather; and I can show you some good pictures. What do you
say?"</p>

<p>Annette clasped her hands.</p>

<p>"It will be lovelee. The river is so beautiful."</p>

<p>"That's understood, then. I'll ask Madame."</p>

<p>He need say no more to her this evening, and risk giving himself
away. But had he not already said too much? Did one ask restaurant
proprietors with pretty daughters down to one's country house
without design? Madame Lamotte would see, if Annette didn't. Well!
there was not much that Madame did not see. Besides, this was the
second time he had stayed to supper with them; he owed them
hospitality.</p>

<p>Walking home towards Park Lane&mdash;for he was staying at his
father's&mdash;with the impression of Annette's soft clever hand
within his own, his thoughts were pleasant, slightly sensual,
rather puzzled. Take steps! What steps? How? Dirty linen washed in
public? Pah! With his reputation for sagacity, for far-sightedness
and the clever extrication of others, he, who stood for proprietary
interests, to become the plaything of that Law of which he was a
pillar! There was something revolting in the thought! Winifred's
affair was bad enough! To have a double dose of publicity in the
family! Would not a liaison be better than that&mdash;a liaison,
and a son he could adopt? But dark, solid, watchful, Madame Lamotte
blocked the avenue of that vision. No! that would not work. It was
not as if Annette could have a real passion for him; one could not
expect that at his age. If her mother wished, if the worldly
advantage were manifestly great&mdash;perhaps! If not, refusal
would be certain. Besides, he thought: 'I'm not a villain. I don't
want to hurt her; and I don't want anything underhand. But I do
want her, and I want a son! There's nothing for it but
divorce&mdash;somehow&mdash;anyhow&mdash;divorce!' Under the shadow
of the plane-trees, in the lamplight, he passed slowly along the
railings of the Green Park. Mist clung there among the bluish tree
shapes, beyond range of the lamps. How many hundred times he had
walked past those trees from his father's house in Park Lane, when
he was quite a young man; or from his own house in Montpellier
Square in those four years of married life! And, to-night, making
up his mind to free himself if he could of that long useless
marriage tie, he took a fancy to walk on, in at Hyde Park Corner,
out at Knightsbridge Gate, just as he used to when going home to
Irene in the old days. What could she be like now?&mdash;how had
she passed the years since he last saw her, twelve years in all,
seven already since Uncle Jolyon left her that money? Was she still
beautiful? Would he know her if he saw her? 'I've not changed
much,' he thought; 'I expect she has. She made me suffer.' He
remembered suddenly one night, the first on which he went out to
dinner alone&mdash;an old Malburian dinner&mdash;the first year of
their marriage. With what eagerness he had hurried back; and,
entering softly as a cat, had heard her playing. Opening the
drawing-room door noiselessly, he had stood watching the expression
on her face, different from any he knew, so much more open, so
confiding, as though to her music she was giving a heart he had
never seen. And he remembered how she stopped and looked round, how
her face changed back to that which he did know, and what an icy
shiver had gone through him, for all that the next moment he was
fondling her shoulders. Yes, she had made him suffer! Divorce! It
seemed ridiculous, after all these years of utter separation! But
it would have to be. No other way! 'The question,' he thought with
sudden realism, 'is&mdash;which of us? She or me? She deserted me.
She ought to pay for it. There'll be someone, I suppose.'
Involuntarily he uttered a little snarling sound, and, turning,
made his way back to Park Lane.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V&mdash;JAMES SEES VISIONS</h3>

<p>The butler himself opened the door, and closing it softly,
detained Soames on the inner mat.</p>

<p>"The master's poorly, sir," he murmured. "He wouldn't go to bed
till you came in. He's still in the diningroom."</p>

<p>Soames responded in the hushed tone to which the house was now
accustomed.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with him, Warmson?"</p>

<p>"Nervous, sir, I think. Might be the funeral; might be Mrs.
Dartie's comin' round this afternoon. I think he overheard
something. I've took him in a negus. The mistress has just gone
up."</p>

<p>Soames hung his hat on a mahogany stag's-horn.</p>

<p>"All right, Warmson, you can go to bed; I'll take him up
myself." And he passed into the dining-room.</p>

<p>James was sitting before the fire, in a big armchair, with a
camel-hair shawl, very light and warm, over his frock-coated
shoulders, on to which his long white whiskers drooped. His white
hair, still fairly thick, glistened in the lamplight; a little
moisture from his fixed, light-grey eyes stained the cheeks, still
quite well coloured, and the long deep furrows running to the
corners of the clean-shaven lips, which moved as if mumbling
thoughts. His long legs, thin as a crow's, in shepherd's plaid
trousers, were bent at less than a right angle, and on one knee a
spindly hand moved continually, with fingers wide apart and
glistening tapered nails. Beside him, on a low stool, stood a
half-finished glass of negus, bedewed with beads of heat. There he
had been sitting, with intervals for meals, all day. At
eighty-eight he was still organically sound, but suffering terribly
from the thought that no one ever told him anything. It is, indeed,
doubtful how he had become aware that Roger was being buried that
day, for Emily had kept it from him. She was always keeping things
from him. Emily was only seventy! James had a grudge against his
wife's youth. He felt sometimes that he would never have married
her if he had known that she would have so many years before her,
when he had so few. It was not natural. She would live fifteen or
twenty years after he was gone, and might spend a lot of money; she
had always had extravagant tastes. For all he knew she might want
to buy one of these motor-cars. Cicely and Rachel and Imogen and
all the young people&mdash;they all rode those bicycles now and
went off Goodness knew where. And now Roger was gone. He didn't
know&mdash;couldn't tell! The family was breaking up. Soames would
know how much his uncle had left. Curiously he thought of Roger as
Soames' uncle not as his own brother. Soames! It was more and more
the one solid spot in a vanishing world. Soames was careful; he was
a warm man; but he had no one to leave his money to. There it was!
He didn't know! And there was that fellow Chamberlain! For James'
political principles had been fixed between '70 and '85 when 'that
rascally Radical' had been the chief thorn in the side of property
and he distrusted him to this day in spite of his conversion; he
would get the country into a mess and make money go down before he
had done with it. A stormy petrel of a chap! Where was Soames? He
had gone to the funeral of course which they had tried to keep from
him. He knew that perfectly well; he had seen his son's trousers.
Roger! Roger in his coffin! He remembered how, when they came up
from school together from the West, on the box seat of the old
Slowflyer in 1824, Roger had got into the 'boot' and gone to sleep.
James uttered a thin cackle. A funny fellow&mdash;Roger&mdash;an
original! He didn't know! Younger than himself, and in his coffin!
The family was breaking up. There was Val going to the university;
he never came to see him now. He would cost a pretty penny up
there. It was an extravagant age. And all the pretty pennies that
his four grandchildren would cost him danced before James' eyes. He
did not grudge them the money, but he grudged terribly the risk
which the spending of that money might bring on them; he grudged
the diminution of security. And now that Cicely had married, she
might be having children too. He didn't know&mdash;couldn't tell!
Nobody thought of anything but spending money in these days, and
racing about, and having what they called 'a good time.' A
motor-car went past the window. Ugly great lumbering thing, making
all that racket! But there it was, the country rattling to the
dogs! People in such a hurry that they couldn't even care for
style&mdash;a neat turnout like his barouche and bays was worth all
those new-fangled things. And consols at 116! There must be a lot
of money in the country. And now there was this old Kruger! They
had tried to keep old Kruger from him. But he knew better; there
would be a pretty kettle of fish out there! He had known how it
would be when that fellow Gladstone&mdash;dead now, thank God! made
such a mess of it after that dreadful business at Majuba. He
shouldn't wonder if the Empire split up and went to pot. And this
vision of the Empire going to pot filled a full quarter of an hour
with qualms of the most serious character. He had eaten a poor
lunch because of them. But it was after lunch that the real
disaster to his nerves occurred. He had been dozing when he became
aware of voices&mdash;low voices. Ah! they never told him anything!
Winifred's and her mother's. "Monty!" That fellow
Dartie&mdash;always that fellow Dartie! The voices had receded; and
James had been left alone, with his ears standing up like a hare's,
and fear creeping about his inwards. Why did they leave him alone?
Why didn't they come and tell him? And an awful thought, which
through long years had haunted him, concreted again swiftly in his
brain. Dartie had gone bankrupt&mdash;fraudulently bankrupt, and to
save Winifred and the children, he&mdash;James&mdash;would have to
pay! Could he&mdash;could Soames turn him into a limited company?
No, he couldn't! There it was! With every minute before Emily came
back the spectre fiercened. Why, it might be forgery! With eyes
fixed on the doubted Turner in the centre of the wall, James
suffered tortures. He saw Dartie in the dock, his grandchildren in
the gutter, and himself in bed. He saw the doubted Turner being
sold at Jobson's, and all the majestic edifice of property in rags.
He saw in fancy Winifred unfashionably dressed, and heard in fancy
Emily's voice saying: "Now, don't fuss, James!" She was always
saying: "Don't fuss!" She had no nerves; he ought never to have
married a woman eighteen years younger than himself. Then Emily's
real voice said:</p>

<p>"Have you had a nice nap, James?"</p>

<p>Nap! He was in torment, and she asked him that!</p>

<p>"What's this about Dartie?" he said, and his eyes glared at
her.</p>

<p>Emily's self-possession never deserted her.</p>

<p>"What have you been hearing?" she asked blandly.</p>

<p>"What's this about Dartie?" repeated James. "He's gone
bankrupt."</p>

<p>"Fiddle!"</p>

<p>James made a great effort, and rose to the full height of his
stork-like figure.</p>

<p>"You never tell me anything," he said; "he's gone bankrupt."</p>

<p>The destruction of that fixed idea seemed to Emily all that
mattered at the moment.</p>

<p>"He has not," she answered firmly. "He's gone to Buenos
Aires."</p>

<p>If she had said "He's gone to Mars" she could not have dealt
James a more stunning blow; his imagination, invested entirely in
British securities, could as little grasp one place as the
other.</p>

<p>"What's he gone there for?" he said. "He's got no money. What
did he take?"</p>

<p>Agitated within by Winifred's news, and goaded by the constant
reiteration of this jeremiad, Emily said calmly:</p>

<p>"He took Winifred's pearls and a dancer."</p>

<p>"What!" said James, and sat down.</p>

<p>His sudden collapse alarmed her, and smoothing his forehead, she
said:</p>

<p>"Now, don't fuss, James!"</p>

<p>A dusky red had spread over James' cheeks and forehead.</p>

<p>"I paid for them," he said tremblingly; "he's a thief! I&mdash;I
knew how it would be. He'll be the death of me; he..." Words failed
him and he sat quite still. Emily, who thought she knew him so
well, was alarmed, and went towards the sideboard where she kept
some sal volatile. She could not see the tenacious Forsyte spirit
working in that thin, tremulous shape against the extravagance of
the emotion called up by this outrage on Forsyte
principles&mdash;the Forsyte spirit deep in there, saying: 'You
mustn't get into a fantod, it'll never do. You won't digest your
lunch. You'll have a fit!' All unseen by her, it was doing better
work in James than sal volatile.</p>

<p>"Drink this," she said.</p>

<p>James waved it aside.</p>

<p>"What was Winifred about," he said, "to let him take her
pearls?" Emily perceived the crisis past.</p>

<p>"She can have mine," she said comfortably. "I never wear them.
She'd better get a divorce."</p>

<p>"There you go!" said James. "Divorce! We've never had a divorce
in the family. Where's Soames?"</p>

<p>"He'll be in directly."</p>

<p>"No, he won't," said James, almost fiercely; "he's at the
funeral. You think I know nothing."</p>

<p>"Well," said Emily with calm, "you shouldn't get into such
fusses when we tell you things." And plumping up his cushions, and
putting the sal volatile beside him, she left the room.</p>

<p>But James sat there seeing visions&mdash;of Winifred in the
Divorce Court, and the family name in the papers; of the earth
falling on Roger's coffin; of Val taking after his father; of the
pearls he had paid for and would never see again; of money back at
four per cent., and the country going to the dogs; and, as the
afternoon wore into evening, and tea-time passed, and dinnertime,
those visions became more and more mixed and menacing&mdash;of
being told nothing, till he had nothing left of all his wealth, and
they told him nothing of it. Where was Soames? Why didn't he come
in?...His hand grasped the glass of negus, he raised it to drink,
and saw his son standing there looking at him. A little sigh of
relief escaped his lips, and putting the glass down, he said:</p>

<p>"There you are! Dartie's gone to Buenos Aires."</p>

<p>Soames nodded. "That's all right," he said; "good riddance."</p>

<p>A wave of assuagement passed over James' brain. Soames knew.
Soames was the only one of them all who had sense. Why couldn't he
come and live at home? He had no son of his own. And he said
plaintively:</p>

<p>"At my age I get nervous. I wish you were more at home, my
boy."</p>

<p>Again Soames nodded; the mask of his countenance betrayed no
understanding, but he went closer, and as if by accident touched
his father's shoulder.</p>

<p>"They sent their love to you at Timothy's," he said. "It went
off all right. I've been to see Winifred. I'm going to take steps."
And he thought: 'Yes, and you mustn't hear of them.'</p>

<p>James looked up; his long white whiskers quivered, his thin
throat between the points of his collar looked very gristly and
naked.</p>

<p>"I've been very poorly all day," he said; "they never tell me
anything."</p>

<p>Soames' heart twitched.</p>

<p>"Well, it's all right. There's nothing to worry about. Will you
come up now?" and he put his hand under his father's arm.</p>

<p>James obediently and tremulously raised himself, and together
they went slowly across the room, which had a rich look in the
firelight, and out to the stairs. Very slowly they ascended.</p>

<p>"Good-night, my boy," said James at his bedroom door.</p>

<p>"Good-night, father," answered Soames. His hand stroked down the
sleeve beneath the shawl; it seemed to have almost nothing in it,
so thin was the arm. And, turning away from the light in the
opening doorway, he went up the extra flight to his own
bedroom.</p>

<p>'I want a son,' he thought, sitting on the edge of his bed; 'I
want a son.'</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER VI&mdash;NO-LONGER-YOUNG JOLYON AT HOME</h3>

<p>Trees take little account of time, and the old oak on the upper
lawn at Robin Hill looked no day older than when Bosinney sprawled
under it and said to Soames: "Forsyte, I've found the very place
for your house." Since then Swithin had dreamed, and old Jolyon
died, beneath its branches. And now, close to the swing,
no-longer-young Jolyon often painted there. Of all spots in the
world it was perhaps the most sacred to him, for he had loved his
father.</p>

<p>Contemplating its great girth&mdash;crinkled and a little
mossed, but not yet hollow&mdash;he would speculate on the passage
of time. That tree had seen, perhaps, all real English history; it
dated, he shouldn't wonder, from the days of Elizabeth at least.
His own fifty years were as nothing to its wood. When the house
behind it, which he now owned, was three hundred years of age
instead of twelve, that tree might still be standing there, vast
and hollow&mdash;for who would commit such sacrilege as to cut it
down? A Forsyte might perhaps still be living in that house, to
guard it jealously. And Jolyon would wonder what the house would
look like coated with such age. Wistaria was already about its
walls&mdash;the new look had gone. Would it hold its own and keep
the dignity Bosinney had bestowed on it, or would the giant London
have lapped it round and made it into an asylum in the midst of a
jerry-built wilderness? Often, within and without of it, he was
persuaded that Bosinney had been moved by the spirit when he built.
He had put his heart into that house, indeed! It might even become
one of the 'homes of England'&mdash;a rare achievement for a house
in these degenerate days of building. And the aesthetic spirit,
moving hand in hand with his Forsyte sense of possessive
continuity, dwelt with pride and pleasure on his ownership thereof.
There was the smack of reverence and ancestor-worship (if only for
one ancestor) in his desire to hand this house down to his son and
his son's son. His father had loved the house, had loved the view,
the grounds, that tree; his last years had been happy there, and no
one had lived there before him. These last eleven years at Robin
Hill had formed in Jolyon's life as a painter, the important period
of success. He was now in the very van of water-colour art, hanging
on the line everywhere. His drawings fetched high prices.
Specialising in that one medium with the tenacity of his breed, he
had 'arrived'&mdash;rather late, but not too late for a member of
the family which made a point of living for ever. His art had
really deepened and improved. In conformity with his position he
had grown a short fair beard, which was just beginning to grizzle,
and hid his Forsyte chin; his brown face had lost the warped
expression of his ostracised period&mdash;he looked, if anything,
younger. The loss of his wife in 1894 had been one of those
domestic tragedies which turn out in the end for the good of all.
He had, indeed, loved her to the last, for his was an affectionate
spirit, but she had become increasingly difficult: jealous of her
step-daughter June, jealous even of her own little daughter Holly,
and making ceaseless plaint that he could not love her, ill as she
was, and 'useless to everyone, and better dead.' He had mourned her
sincerely, but his face had looked younger since she died. If she
could only have believed that she made him happy, how much happier
would the twenty years of their companionship have been!</p>

<p>June had never really got on well with her who had reprehensibly
taken her own mother's place; and ever since old Jolyon died she
had been established in a sort of studio in London. But she had
come back to Robin Hill on her stepmother's death, and gathered the
reins there into her small decided hands. Jolly was then at Harrow;
Holly still learning from Mademoiselle Beauce. There had been
nothing to keep Jolyon at home, and he had removed his grief and
his paint-box abroad. There he had wandered, for the most part in
Brittany, and at last had fetched up in Paris. He had stayed there
several months, and come back with the younger face and the short
fair beard. Essentially a man who merely lodged in any house, it
had suited him perfectly that June should reign at Robin Hill, so
that he was free to go off with his easel where and when he liked.
She was inclined, it is true, to regard the house rather as an
asylum for her proteges! but his own outcast days had filled Jolyon
for ever with sympathy towards an outcast, and June's 'lame ducks'
about the place did not annoy him. By all means let her have them
down&mdash;and feed them up; and though his slightly cynical humour
perceived that they ministered to his daughter's love of domination
as well as moved her warm heart, he never ceased to admire her for
having so many ducks. He fell, indeed, year by year into a more and
more detached and brotherly attitude towards his own son and
daughters, treating them with a sort of whimsical equality. When he
went down to Harrow to see Jolly, he never quite knew which of them
was the elder, and would sit eating cherries with him out of one
paper bag, with an affectionate and ironical smile twisting up an
eyebrow and curling his lips a little. And he was always careful to
have money in his pocket, and to be modish in his dress, so that
his son need not blush for him. They were perfect friends, but
never seemed to have occasion for verbal confidences, both having
the competitive self-consciousness of Forsytes. They knew they
would stand by each other in scrapes, but there was no need to talk
about it. Jolyon had a striking horror&mdash;partly original sin,
but partly the result of his early immorality&mdash;of the moral
attitude. The most he could ever have said to his son would have
been:</p>

<p>"Look here, old man; don't forget you're a gentleman," and then
have wondered whimsically whether that was not a snobbish
sentiment. The great cricket match was perhaps the most searching
and awkward time they annually went through together, for Jolyon
had been at Eton. They would be particularly careful during that
match, continually saying: "Hooray! Oh! hard luck, old man!" or
"Hooray! Oh! bad luck, Dad!" to each other, when some disaster at
which their hearts bounded happened to the opposing school. And
Jolyon would wear a grey top hat, instead of his usual soft one, to
save his son's feelings, for a black top hat he could not stomach.
When Jolly went up to Oxford, Jolyon went up with him, amused,
humble, and a little anxious not to discredit his boy amongst all
these youths who seemed so much more assured and old than himself.
He often thought, 'Glad I'm a painter' for he had long dropped
under-writing at Lloyds&mdash;'it's so innocuous. You can't look
down on a painter&mdash;you can't take him seriously enough.' For
Jolly, who had a sort of natural lordliness, had passed at once
into a very small set, who secretly amused his father. The boy had
fair hair which curled a little, and his grandfather's deepset
iron-grey eyes. He was well-built and very upright, and always
pleased Jolyon's aesthetic sense, so that he was a tiny bit afraid
of him, as artists ever are of those of their own sex whom they
admire physically. On that occasion, however, he actually did screw
up his courage to give his son advice, and this was it:</p>

<p>"Look here, old man, you're bound to get into debt; mind you
come to me at once. Of course, I'll always pay them. But you might
remember that one respects oneself more afterwards if one pays
one's own way. And don't ever borrow, except from me, will
you?"</p>

<p>And Jolly had said:</p>

<p>"All right, Dad, I won't," and he never had.</p>

<p>"And there's just one other thing. I don't know much about
morality and that, but there is this: It's always worth while
before you do anything to consider whether it's going to hurt
another person more than is absolutely necessary."</p>

<p>Jolly had looked thoughtful, and nodded, and presently had
squeezed his father's hand. And Jolyon had thought: 'I wonder if I
had the right to say that?' He always had a sort of dread of losing
the dumb confidence they had in each other; remembering how for
long years he had lost his own father's, so that there had been
nothing between them but love at a great distance. He
under-estimated, no doubt, the change in the spirit of the age
since he himself went up to Cambridge in '65; and perhaps he
underestimated, too, his boy's power of understanding that he was
tolerant to the very bone. It was that tolerance of his, and
possibly his scepticism, which ever made his relations towards June
so queerly defensive. She was such a decided mortal; knew her own
mind so terribly well; wanted things so inexorably until she got
them&mdash;and then, indeed, often dropped them like a hot potato.
Her mother had been like that, whence had come all those tears. Not
that his incompatibility with his daughter was anything like what
it had been with the first Mrs. Young Jolyon. One could be amused
where a daughter was concerned; in a wife's case one could not be
amused. To see June set her heart and jaw on a thing until she got
it was all right, because it was never anything which interfered
fundamentally with Jolyon's liberty&mdash;the one thing on which
his jaw was also absolutely rigid, a considerable jaw, under that
short grizzling beard. Nor was there ever any necessity for real
heart-to-heart encounters. One could break away into irony&mdash;as
indeed he often had to. But the real trouble with June was that she
had never appealed to his aesthetic sense, though she might well
have, with her red-gold hair and her viking-coloured eyes, and that
touch of the Berserker in her spirit. It was very different with
Holly, soft and quiet, shy and affectionate, with a playful imp in
her somewhere. He watched this younger daughter of his through the
duckling stage with extraordinary interest. Would she come out a
swan? With her sallow oval face and her grey wistful eyes and those
long dark lashes, she might, or she might not. Only this last year
had he been able to guess. Yes, she would be a swan&mdash;rather a
dark one, always a shy one, but an authentic swan. She was eighteen
now, and Mademoiselle Beauce was gone&mdash;the excellent lady had
removed, after eleven years haunted by her continuous reminiscences
of the 'well-brrred little Tayleurs,' to another family whose bosom
would now be agitated by her reminiscences of the 'well-brrred
little Forsytes.' She had taught Holly to speak French like
herself.</p>

<p>Portraiture was not Jolyon's forte, but he had already drawn his
younger daughter three times, and was drawing her a fourth, on the
afternoon of October 4th, 1899, when a card was brought to him
which caused his eyebrows to go up:</p>

<blockquote>MR. SOAMES FORSYTE<br>
THE SHELTER, CONNOISSEURS CLUB, MAPLEDURHAM. ST.
JAMES'S.</blockquote>

<p>But here the Forsyte Saga must digress again...</p>

<p>To return from a long travel in Spain to a darkened house, to a
little daughter bewildered with tears, to the sight of a loved
father lying peaceful in his last sleep, had never been, was never
likely to be, forgotten by so impressionable and warm-hearted a man
as Jolyon. A sense as of mystery, too, clung to that sad day, and
about the end of one whose life had been so well-ordered, balanced,
and above-board. It seemed incredible that his father could thus
have vanished without, as it were, announcing his intention,
without last words to his son, and due farewells. And those
incoherent allusions of little Holly to 'the lady in grey,' of
Mademoiselle Beauce to a Madame Errant (as it sounded) involved all
things in a mist, lifted a little when he read his father's will
and the codicil thereto. It had been his duty as executor of that
will and codicil to inform Irene, wife of his cousin Soames, of her
life interest in fifteen thousand pounds. He had called on her to
explain that the existing investment in India Stock, ear-marked to
meet the charge, would produce for her the interesting net sum of
L430 odd a year, clear of income tax. This was but the third time
he had seen his cousin Soames' wife&mdash;if indeed she was still
his wife, of which he was not quite sure. He remembered having seen
her sitting in the Botanical Gardens waiting for Bosinney&mdash;a
passive, fascinating figure, reminding him of Titian's 'Heavenly
Love,' and again, when, charged by his father, he had gone to
Montpellier Square on the afternoon when Bosinney's death was
known. He still recalled vividly her sudden appearance in the
drawing-room doorway on that occasion&mdash;her beautiful face,
passing from wild eagerness of hope to stony despair; remembered
the compassion he had felt, Soames' snarling smile, his words, "We
are not at home!" and the slam of the front door.</p>

<p>This third time he saw a face and form more
beautiful&mdash;freed from that warp of wild hope and despair.
Looking at her, he thought: 'Yes, you are just what the Dad would
have admired!' And the strange story of his father's Indian summer
became slowly clear to him. She spoke of old Jolyon with reverence
and tears in her eyes. "He was so wonderfully kind to me; I don't
know why. He looked so beautiful and peaceful sitting in that chair
under the tree; it was I who first came on him sitting there, you
know. Such a lovely day. I don't think an end could have been
happier. We should all like to go out like that."</p>

<p>'Quite right!' he had thought. 'We should all a like to go out
in full summer with beauty stepping towards us across a lawn.' And
looking round the little, almost empty drawing-room, he had asked
her what she was going to do now. "I am going to live again a
little, Cousin Jolyon. It's wonderful to have money of one's own.
I've never had any. I shall keep this flat, I think; I'm used to
it; but I shall be able to go to Italy."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Jolyon had murmured, looking at her faintly smiling
lips; and he had gone away thinking: 'A fascinating woman! What a
waste! I'm glad the Dad left her that money.' He had not seen her
again, but every quarter he had signed her cheque, forwarding it to
her bank, with a note to the Chelsea flat to say that he had done
so; and always he had received a note in acknowledgment, generally
from the flat, but sometimes from Italy; so that her personality
had become embodied in slightly scented grey paper, an upright fine
handwriting, and the words, 'Dear Cousin Jolyon.' Man of property
that he now was, the slender cheque he signed often gave rise to
the thought: 'Well, I suppose she just manages'; sliding into a
vague wonder how she was faring otherwise in a world of men not
wont to let beauty go unpossessed. At first Holly had spoken of her
sometimes, but 'ladies in grey' soon fade from children's memories;
and the tightening of June's lips in those first weeks after her
grandfather's death whenever her former friend's name was
mentioned, had discouraged allusion. Only once, indeed, had June
spoken definitely: "I've forgiven her. I'm frightfully glad she's
independent now..."</p>

<p>On receiving Soames' card, Jolyon said to the maid&mdash;for he
could not abide butlers&mdash;"Show him into the study, please, and
say I'll be there in a minute;" and then he looked at Holly and
asked:</p>

<p>"Do you remember 'the lady in grey,' who used to give you
music-lessons?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, why? Has she come?"</p>

<p>Jolyon shook his head, and, changing his holland blouse for a
coat, was silent, perceiving suddenly that such history was not for
those young ears. His face, in fact, became whimsical perplexity
incarnate while he journeyed towards the study.</p>

<p>Standing by the french-window, looking out across the terrace at
the oak tree, were two figures, middle-aged and young, and he
thought: 'Who's that boy? Surely they never had a child.'</p>

<p>The elder figure turned. The meeting of those two Forsytes of
the second generation, so much more sophisticated than the first,
in the house built for the one and owned and occupied by the other,
was marked by subtle defensiveness beneath distinct attempt at
cordiality. 'Has he come about his wife?' Jolyon was thinking; and
Soames, 'How shall I begin?' while Val, brought to break the ice,
stood negligently scrutinising this 'bearded pard' from under his
dark, thick eyelashes.</p>

<p>"This is Val Dartie," said Soames, "my sister's son. He's just
going up to Oxford. I thought I'd like him to know your boy."</p>

<p>"Ah! I'm sorry Jolly's away. What college?"</p>

<p>"B.N.C.," replied Val.</p>

<p>"Jolly's at the 'House,' but he'll be delighted to look you
up."</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully."</p>

<p>"Holly's in&mdash;if you could put up with a female relation,
she'd show you round. You'll find her in the hall if you go through
the curtains. I was just painting her."</p>

<p>With another "Thanks, awfully!" Val vanished, leaving the two
cousins with the ice unbroken.</p>

<p>"I see you've some drawings at the 'Water Colours,'" said
Soames.</p>

<p>Jolyon winced. He had been out of touch with the Forsyte family
at large for twenty-six years, but they were connected in his mind
with Frith's 'Derby Day' and Landseer prints. He had heard from
June that Soames was a connoisseur, which made it worse. He had
become aware, too, of a curious sensation of repugnance.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen you for a long time," he said.</p>

<p>"No," answered Soames between close lips, "not since&mdash;as a
matter of fact, it's about that I've come. You're her trustee, I'm
told."</p>

<p>Jolyon nodded.</p>

<p>"Twelve years is a long time," said Soames rapidly: "I&mdash;I'm
tired of it."</p>

<p>Jolyon found no more appropriate answer than:</p>

<p>"Won't you smoke?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks."</p>

<p>Jolyon himself lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"I wish to be free," said Soames abruptly.</p>

<p>"I don't see her," murmured Jolyon through the fume of his
cigarette.</p>

<p>"But you know where she lives, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Jolyon nodded. He did not mean to give her address without
permission. Soames seemed to divine his thought.</p>

<p>"I don't want her address," he said; "I know it."</p>

<p>"What exactly do you want?"</p>

<p>"She deserted me. I want a divorce."</p>

<p>"Rather late in the day, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Soames. And there was a silence.</p>

<p>"I don't know much about these things&mdash;at least, I've
forgotten," said Jolyon with a wry smile. He himself had had to
wait for death to grant him a divorce from the first Mrs. Jolyon.
"Do you wish me to see her about it?"</p>

<p>Soames raised his eyes to his cousin's face. "I suppose there's
someone," he said.</p>

<p>A shrug moved Jolyon's shoulders.</p>

<p>"I don't know at all. I imagine you may have both lived as if
the other were dead. It's usual in these cases."</p>

<p>Soames turned to the window. A few early fallen oak-leaves
strewed the terrace already, and were rolling round in the wind.
Jolyon saw the figures of Holly and Val Dartie moving across the
lawn towards the stables. 'I'm not going to run with the hare and
hunt with the hounds,' he thought. 'I must act for her. The Dad
would have wished that.' And for a swift moment he seemed to see
his father's figure in the old armchair, just beyond Soames,
sitting with knees crossed, The Times in his hand. It vanished.</p>

<p>"My father was fond of her," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"Why he should have been I don't know," Soames answered without
looking round. "She brought trouble to your daughter June; she
brought trouble to everyone. I gave her all she wanted. I would
have given her even&mdash;forgiveness&mdash;but she chose to leave
me."</p>

<p>In Jolyon compassion was checked by the tone of that close
voice. What was there in the fellow that made it so difficult to be
sorry for him?</p>

<p>"I can go and see her, if you like," he said. "I suppose she
might be glad of a divorce, but I know nothing."</p>

<p>Soames nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, please go. As I say, I know her address; but I've no wish
to see her." His tongue was busy with his lips, as if they were
very dry.</p>

<p>"You'll have some tea?" said Jolyon, stifling the words: 'And
see the house.' And he led the way into the hall. When he had rung
the bell and ordered tea, he went to his easel to turn his drawing
to the wall. He could not bear, somehow, that his work should be
seen by Soames, who was standing there in the middle of the great
room which had been designed expressly to afford wall space for his
own pictures. In his cousin's face, with its unseizable family
likeness to himself, and its chinny, narrow, concentrated look,
Jolyon saw that which moved him to the thought: 'That chap could
never forget anything&mdash;nor ever give himself away. He's
pathetic!'</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE COLT AND THE FILLY</h3>

<p>When young Val left the presence of the last generation he was
thinking: 'This is jolly dull! Uncle Soames does take the bun. I
wonder what this filly's like?' He anticipated no pleasure from her
society; and suddenly he saw her standing there looking at him.
Why, she was pretty! What luck!</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you don't know me," he said. "My name's Val
Dartie&mdash;I'm once removed, second cousin, something like that,
you know. My mother's name was Forsyte."</p>

<p>Holly, whose slim brown hand remained in his because she was too
shy to withdraw it, said:</p>

<p>"I don't know any of my relations. Are there many?"</p>

<p>"Tons. They're awful&mdash;most of them. At least, I don't
know&mdash;some of them. One's relations always are, aren't
they?"</p>

<p>"I expect they think one awful too," said Holly.</p>

<p>"I don't know why they should. No one could think you awful, of
course."</p>

<p>Holly looked at him&mdash;the wistful candour in those grey eyes
gave young Val a sudden feeling that he must protect her.</p>

<p>"I mean there are people and people," he added astutely. "Your
dad looks awfully decent, for instance."</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" said Holly fervently; "he is."</p>

<p>A flush mounted in Val's cheeks&mdash;that scene in the
Pandemonium promenade&mdash;the dark man with the pink carnation
developing into his own father! "But you know what the Forsytes
are," he said almost viciously. "Oh! I forgot; you don't."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"Oh! fearfully careful; not sportsmen a bit. Look at Uncle
Soames!"</p>

<p>"I'd like to," said Holly.</p>

<p>Val resisted a desire to run his arm through hers. "Oh! no," he
said, "let's go out. You'll see him quite soon enough. What's your
brother like?"</p>

<p>Holly led the way on to the terrace and down to the lawn without
answering. How describe Jolly, who, ever since she remembered
anything, had been her lord, master, and ideal?</p>

<p>"Does he sit on you?" said Val shrewdly. "I shall be knowing him
at Oxford. Have you got any horses?"</p>

<p>Holly nodded. "Would you like to see the stables?"</p>

<p>"Rather!"</p>

<p>They passed under the oak tree, through a thin shrubbery, into
the stable-yard. There under a clock-tower lay a fluffy
brown-and-white dog, so old that he did not get up, but faintly
waved the tail curled over his back.</p>

<p>"That's Balthasar," said Holly; "he's so old&mdash;awfully old,
nearly as old as I am. Poor old boy! He's devoted to Dad."</p>

<p>"Balthasar! That's a rum name. He isn't purebred you know."</p>

<p>"No! but he's a darling," and she bent down to stroke the dog.
Gentle and supple, with dark covered head and slim browned neck and
hands, she seemed to Val strange and sweet, like a thing slipped
between him and all previous knowledge.</p>

<p>"When grandfather died," she said, "he wouldn't eat for two
days. He saw him die, you know."</p>

<p>"Was that old Uncle Jolyon? Mother always says he was a
topper."</p>

<p>"He was," said Holly simply, and opened the stable door.</p>

<p>In a loose-box stood a silver roan of about fifteen hands, with
a long black tail and mane. "This is mine&mdash;Fairy."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Val, "she's a jolly palfrey. But you ought to bang
her tail. She'd look much smarter." Then catching her wondering
look, he thought suddenly: 'I don't know&mdash;anything she likes!'
And he took a long sniff of the stable air. "Horses are ripping,
aren't they? My Dad..." he stopped.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Holly.</p>

<p>An impulse to unbosom himself almost overcame him&mdash;but not
quite. "Oh! I don't know he's often gone a mucker over them. I'm
jolly keen on them too&mdash;riding and hunting. I like racing
awfully, as well; I should like to be a gentleman rider." And
oblivious of the fact that he had but one more day in town, with
two engagements, he plumped out:</p>

<p>"I say, if I hire a gee to-morrow, will you come a ride in
Richmond Park?"</p>

<p>Holly clasped her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh yes! I simply love riding. But there's Jolly's horse; why
don't you ride him? Here he is. We could go after tea."</p>

<p>Val looked doubtfully at his trousered legs.</p>

<p>He had imagined them immaculate before her eyes in high brown
boots and Bedford cords.</p>

<p>"I don't much like riding his horse," he said. "He mightn't like
it. Besides, Uncle Soames wants to get back, I expect. Not that I
believe in buckling under to him, you know. You haven't got an
uncle, have you? This is rather a good beast," he added,
scrutinising Jolly's horse, a dark brown, which was showing the
whites of its eyes. "You haven't got any hunting here, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"No; I don't know that I want to hunt. It must be awfully
exciting, of course; but it's cruel, isn't it? June says so."</p>

<p>"Cruel?" ejaculated Val. "Oh! that's all rot. Who's June?"</p>

<p>"My sister&mdash;my half-sister, you know&mdash;much older than
me." She had put her hands up to both cheeks of Jolly's horse, and
was rubbing her nose against its nose with a gentle snuffling noise
which seemed to have an hypnotic effect on the animal. Val
contemplated her cheek resting against the horse's nose, and her
eyes gleaming round at him. 'She's really a duck,' he thought.</p>

<p>They returned to the house less talkative, followed this time by
the dog Balthasar, walking more slowly than anything on earth, and
clearly expecting them not to exceed his speed limit.</p>

<p>"This is a ripping place," said Val from under the oak tree,
where they had paused to allow the dog Balthasar to come up.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Holly, and sighed. "Of course I want to go
everywhere. I wish I were a gipsy."</p>

<p>"Yes, gipsies are jolly," replied Val, with a conviction which
had just come to him; "you're rather like one, you know."</p>

<p>Holly's face shone suddenly and deeply, like dark leaves gilded
by the sun.</p>

<p>"To go mad-rabbiting everywhere and see everything, and live in
the open&mdash;oh! wouldn't it be fun?"</p>

<p>"Let's do it!" said Val.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, let's!"</p>

<p>"It'd be grand sport, just you and I."</p>

<p>Then Holly perceived the quaintness and gushed.</p>

<p>"Well, we've got to do it," said Val obstinately, but reddening
too.</p>

<p>"I believe in doing things you want to do. What's down
there?"</p>

<p>"The kitchen-garden, and the pond and the coppice, and the
farm."</p>

<p>"Let's go down!"</p>

<p>Holly glanced back at the house.</p>

<p>"It's tea-time, I expect; there's Dad beckoning."</p>

<p>Val, uttering a growly sound, followed her towards the
house.</p>

<p>When they re-entered the hall gallery the sight of two
middle-aged Forsytes drinking tea together had its magical effect,
and they became quite silent. It was, indeed, an impressive
spectacle. The two were seated side by side on an arrangement in
marqueterie which looked like three silvery pink chairs made one,
with a low tea-table in front of them. They seemed to have taken up
that position, as far apart as the seat would permit, so that they
need not look at each other too much; and they were eating and
drinking rather than talking&mdash;Soames with his air of despising
the tea-cake as it disappeared, Jolyon of finding himself slightly
amusing. To the casual eye neither would have seemed greedy, but
both were getting through a good deal of sustenance. The two young
ones having been supplied with food, the process went on silent and
absorbative, till, with the advent of cigarettes, Jolyon said to
Soames:</p>

<p>"And how's Uncle James?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, very shaky."</p>

<p>"We're a wonderful family, aren't we? The other day I was
calculating the average age of the ten old Forsytes from my
father's family Bible. I make it eighty-four already, and five
still living. They ought to beat the record;" and looking
whimsically at Soames, he added:</p>

<p>"We aren't the men they were, you know."</p>

<p>Soames smiled. 'Do you really think I shall admit that I'm not
their equal'; he seemed to be saying, 'or that I've got to give up
anything, especially life?'</p>

<p>"We may live to their age, perhaps," pursued Jolyon, "but
self-consciousness is a handicap, you know, and that's the
difference between us. We've lost conviction. How and when
self-consciousness was born I never can make out. My father had a
little, but I don't believe any other of the old Forsytes ever had
a scrap. Never to see yourself as others see you, it's a wonderful
preservative. The whole history of the last century is in the
difference between us. And between us and you," he added, gazing
through a ring of smoke at Val and Holly, uncomfortable under his
quizzical regard, "there'll be&mdash;another difference. I wonder
what."</p>

<p>Soames took out his watch.</p>

<p>"We must go," he said, "if we're to catch our train."</p>

<p>"Uncle Soames never misses a train," muttered Val, with his
mouth full.</p>

<p>"Why should I?" Soames answered simply.</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know," grumbled Val, "other people do."</p>

<p>At the front door he gave Holly's slim brown hand a long and
surreptitious squeeze.</p>

<p>"Look out for me to-morrow," he whispered; "three o'clock. I'll
wait for you in the road; it'll save time. We'll have a ripping
ride." He gazed back at her from the lodge gate, and, but for the
principles of a man about town, would have waved his hand. He felt
in no mood to tolerate his uncle's conversation. But he was not in
danger. Soames preserved a perfect muteness, busy with far-away
thoughts.</p>

<p>The yellow leaves came down about those two walking the mile and
a half which Soames had traversed so often in those long-ago days
when he came down to watch with secret pride the building of the
house&mdash;that house which was to have been the home of him and
her from whom he was now going to seek release. He looked back
once, up that endless vista of autumn lane between the yellowing
hedges. What an age ago! "I don't want to see her," he had said to
Jolyon. Was that true? 'I may have to,' he thought; and he
shivered, seized by one of those queer shudderings that they say
mean footsteps on one's grave. A chilly world! A queer world! And
glancing sidelong at his nephew, he thought: 'Wish I were his age!
I wonder what she's like now!'</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;JOLYON PROSECUTES TRUSTEESHIP</h3>

<p>When those two were gone Jolyon did not return to his painting,
for daylight was failing, but went to the study, craving
unconsciously a revival of that momentary vision of his father
sitting in the old leather chair with his knees crossed and his
straight eyes gazing up from under the dome of his massive brow.
Often in this little room, cosiest in the house, Jolyon would catch
a moment of communion with his father. Not, indeed, that he had
definitely any faith in the persistence of the human
spirit&mdash;the feeling was not so logical&mdash;it was, rather,
an atmospheric impact, like a scent, or one of those strong
animistic impressions from forms, or effects of light, to which
those with the artist's eye are especially prone. Here
only&mdash;in this little unchanged room where his father had spent
the most of his waking hours&mdash;could be retrieved the feeling
that he was not quite gone, that the steady counsel of that old
spirit and the warmth of his masterful lovability endured.</p>

<p>What would his father be advising now, in this sudden
recrudescence of an old tragedy&mdash;what would he say to this
menace against her to whom he had taken such a fancy in the last
weeks of his life? 'I must do my best for her,' thought Jolyon; 'he
left her to me in his will. But what is the best?'</p>

<p>And as if seeking to regain the sapience, the balance and shrewd
common sense of that old Forsyte, he sat down in the ancient chair
and crossed his knees. But he felt a mere shadow sitting there; nor
did any inspiration come, while the fingers of the wind tapped on
the darkening panes of the french-window.</p>

<p>'Go and see her?' he thought, 'or ask her to come down here?
What's her life been? What is it now, I wonder? Beastly to rake up
things at this time of day.' Again the figure of his cousin
standing with a hand on a front door of a fine olive-green leaped
out, vivid, like one of those figures from old-fashioned clocks
when the hour strikes; and his words sounded in Jolyon's ears
clearer than any chime: "I manage my own affairs. I've told you
once, I tell you again: We are not at home." The repugnance he had
then felt for Soames&mdash;for his flat-cheeked, shaven face full
of spiritual bull-doggedness; for his spare, square, sleek figure
slightly crouched as it were over the bone he could not
digest&mdash;came now again, fresh as ever, nay, with an odd
increase. 'I dislike him,' he thought, 'I dislike him to the very
roots of me. And that's lucky; it'll make it easier for me to back
his wife.' Half-artist, and half-Forsyte, Jolyon was
constitutionally averse from what he termed 'ructions'; unless
angered, he conformed deeply to that classic description of the
she-dog, 'Er'd ruther run than fight.' A little smile became
settled in his beard. Ironical that Soames should come down
here&mdash;to this house, built for himself! How he had gazed and
gaped at this ruin of his past intention; furtively nosing at the
walls and stairway, appraising everything! And intuitively Jolyon
thought: 'I believe the fellow even now would like to be living
here. He could never leave off longing for what he once owned!
Well, I must act, somehow or other; but it's a bore&mdash;a great
bore.'</p>

<p>Late that evening he wrote to the Chelsea flat, asking if Irene
would see him.</p>

<p>The old century which had seen the plant of individualism flower
so wonderfully was setting in a sky orange with coming storms.
Rumours of war added to the briskness of a London turbulent at the
close of the summer holidays. And the streets to Jolyon, who was
not often up in town, had a feverish look, due to these new
motorcars and cabs, of which he disapproved aesthetically. He
counted these vehicles from his hansom, and made the proportion of
them one in twenty. 'They were one in thirty about a year ago,' he
thought; 'they've come to stay. Just so much more rattling round of
wheels and general stink'&mdash;for he was one of those rather rare
Liberals who object to anything new when it takes a material form;
and he instructed his driver to get down to the river quickly, out
of the traffic, desiring to look at the water through the mellowing
screen of plane-trees. At the little block of flats which stood
back some fifty yards from the Embankment, he told the cabman to
wait, and went up to the first floor.</p>

<p>Yes, Mrs. Heron was at home!</p>

<p>The effect of a settled if very modest income was at once
apparent to him remembering the threadbare refinement in that tiny
flat eight years ago when he announced her good fortune. Everything
was now fresh, dainty, and smelled of flowers. The general effect
was silvery with touches of black, hydrangea colour, and gold. 'A
woman of great taste,' he thought. Time had dealt gently with
Jolyon, for he was a Forsyte. But with Irene Time hardly seemed to
deal at all, or such was his impression. She appeared to him not a
day older, standing there in mole-coloured velvet corduroy, with
soft dark eyes and dark gold hair, with outstretched hand and a
little smile.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?"</p>

<p>He had probably never occupied a chair with a fuller sense of
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"You look absolutely unchanged," he said.</p>

<p>"And you look younger, Cousin Jolyon."</p>

<p>Jolyon ran his hands through his hair, whose thickness was still
a comfort to him.</p>

<p>"I'm ancient, but I don't feel it. That's one thing about
painting, it keeps you young. Titian lived to ninety-nine, and had
to have plague to kill him off. Do you know, the first time I ever
saw you I thought of a picture by him?"</p>

<p>"When did you see me for the first time?"</p>

<p>"In the Botanical Gardens."</p>

<p>"How did you know me, if you'd never seen me before?"</p>

<p>"By someone who came up to you." He was looking at her hardily,
but her face did not change; and she said quietly:</p>

<p>"Yes; many lives ago."</p>

<p>"What is your recipe for youth, Irene?"</p>

<p>"People who don't live are wonderfully preserved."</p>

<p>H'm! a bitter little saying! People who don't live! But an
opening, and he took it. "You remember my Cousin Soames?"</p>

<p>He saw her smile faintly at that whimsicality, and at once went
on:</p>

<p>"He came to see me the day before yesterday! He wants a divorce.
Do you?"</p>

<p>"I?" The word seemed startled out of her. "After twelve years?
It's rather late. Won't it be difficult?"</p>

<p>Jolyon looked hard into her face. "Unless..." he said.</p>

<p>"Unless I have a lover now. But I have never had one since."</p>

<p>What did he feel at the simplicity and candour of those words?
Relief, surprise, pity! Venus for twelve years without a lover!</p>

<p>"And yet," he said, "I suppose you would give a good deal to be
free, too?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. What does it matter, now?"</p>

<p>"But if you were to love again?"</p>

<p>"I should love." In that simple answer she seemed to sum up the
whole philosophy of one on whom the world had turned its back.</p>

<p>"Well! Is there anything you would like me to say to him?"</p>

<p>"Only that I'm sorry he's not free. He had his chance once. I
don't know why he didn't take it."</p>

<p>"Because he was a Forsyte; we never part with things, you know,
unless we want something in their place; and not always then."</p>

<p>Irene smiled. "Don't you, Cousin Jolyon?&mdash;I think you
do."</p>

<p>"Of course, I'm a bit of a mongrel&mdash;not quite a pure
Forsyte. I never take the halfpennies off my cheques, I put them
on," said Jolyon uneasily.</p>

<p>"Well, what does Soames want in place of me now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; perhaps children."</p>

<p>She was silent for a little, looking down.</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured; "it's hard. I would help him to be free if
I could."</p>

<p>Jolyon gazed into his hat, his embarrassment was increasing
fast; so was his admiration, his wonder, and his pity. She was so
lovely, and so lonely; and altogether it was such a coil!</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I shall have to see Soames. If there's
anything I can do for you I'm always at your service. You must
think of me as a wretched substitute for my father. At all events
I'll let you know what happens when I speak to Soames. He may
supply the material himself."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You see, he has a lot to lose; and I have nothing. I should
like him to be free; but I don't see what I can do."</p>

<p>"Nor I at the moment," said Jolyon, and soon after took his
leave. He went down to his hansom. Half-past three! Soames would be
at his office still.</p>

<p>"To the Poultry," he called through the trap. In front of the
Houses of Parliament and in Whitehall, newsvendors were calling,
"Grave situation in the Transvaal!" but the cries hardly roused
him, absorbed in recollection of that very beautiful figure, of her
soft dark glance, and the words: "I have never had one since." What
on earth did such a woman do with her life, back-watered like this?
Solitary, unprotected, with every man's hand against her or
rather&mdash;reaching out to grasp her at the least sign. And year
after year she went on like that!</p>

<p>The word 'Poultry' above the passing citizens brought him back
to reality.</p>

<p>'Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte,' in black letters on a ground the
colour of peasoup, spurred him to a sort of vigour, and he went up
the stone stairs muttering: "Fusty musty ownerships! Well, we
couldn't do without them!"</p>

<p>"I want Mr. Soames Forsyte," he said to the boy who opened the
door.</p>

<p>"What name?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Jolyon Forsyte."</p>

<p>The youth looked at him curiously, never having seen a Forsyte
with a beard, and vanished.</p>

<p>The offices of 'Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte' had slowly
absorbed the offices of 'Tooting and Bowles,' and occupied the
whole of the first floor.</p>

<p>The firm consisted now of nothing but Soames and a number of
managing and articled clerks. The complete retirement of James some
six years ago had accelerated business, to which the final touch of
speed had been imparted when Bustard dropped off, worn out, as many
believed, by the suit of 'Fryer versus Forsyte,' more in Chancery
than ever and less likely to benefit its beneficiaries. Soames,
with his saner grasp of actualities, had never permitted it to
worry him; on the contrary, he had long perceived that Providence
had presented him therein with L200 a year net in perpetuity,
and&mdash;why not?</p>

<p>When Jolyon entered, his cousin was drawing out a list of
holdings in Consols, which in view of the rumours of war he was
going to advise his companies to put on the market at once, before
other companies did the same. He looked round, sidelong, and
said:</p>

<p>"How are you? Just one minute. Sit down, won't you?" And having
entered three amounts, and set a ruler to keep his place, he turned
towards Jolyon, biting the side of his flat forefinger...</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said.</p>

<p>"I have seen her."</p>

<p>Soames frowned.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"She has remained faithful to memory."</p>

<p>Having said that, Jolyon was ashamed. His cousin had flushed a
dusky yellowish red. What had made him tease the poor brute!</p>

<p>"I was to tell you she is sorry you are not free. Twelve years
is a long time. You know your law, and what chance it gives you."
Soames uttered a curious little grunt, and the two remained a full
minute without speaking. 'Like wax!' thought Jolyon, watching that
close face, where the flush was fast subsiding. 'He'll never give
me a sign of what he's thinking, or going to do. Like wax!' And he
transferred his gaze to a plan of that flourishing town, 'By-Street
on Sea,' the future existence of which lay exposed on the wall to
the possessive instincts of the firm's clients. The whimsical
thought flashed through him: 'I wonder if I shall get a bill of
costs for this&mdash;"To attending Mr. Jolyon Forsyte in the matter
of my divorce, to receiving his account of his visit to my wife,
and to advising him to go and see her again, sixteen and
eightpence."'</p>

<p>Suddenly Soames said: "I can't go on like this. I tell you, I
can't go on like this." His eyes were shifting from side to side,
like an animal's when it looks for way of escape. 'He really
suffers,' thought Jolyon; 'I've no business to forget that, just
because I don't like him.'</p>

<p>"Surely," he said gently, "it lies with yourself. A man can
always put these things through if he'll take it on himself."</p>

<p>Soames turned square to him, with a sound which seemed to come
from somewhere very deep.</p>

<p>"Why should I suffer more than I've suffered already? Why should
I?"</p>

<p>Jolyon could only shrug his shoulders. His reason agreed, his
instinct rebelled; he could not have said why.</p>

<p>"Your father," went on Soames, "took an interest in
her&mdash;why, goodness knows! And I suppose you do too?" he gave
Jolyon a sharp look. "It seems to me that one only has to do
another person a wrong to get all the sympathy. I don't know in
what way I was to blame&mdash;I've never known. I always treated
her well. I gave her everything she could wish for. I wanted
her."</p>

<p>Again Jolyon's reason nodded; again his instinct shook its head.
'What is it?' he thought; 'there must be something wrong in me. Yet
if there is, I'd rather be wrong than right.'</p>

<p>"After all," said Soames with a sort of glum fierceness, "she
was my wife."</p>

<p>In a flash the thought went through his listener: 'There it is!
Ownerships! Well, we all own things. But&mdash;human beings!
Pah!'</p>

<p>"You have to look at facts," he said drily, "or rather the want
of them."</p>

<p>Soames gave him another quick suspicious look.</p>

<p>"The want of them?" he said. "Yes, but I am not so sure."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," replied Jolyon; "I've told you what she
said. It was explicit."</p>

<p>"My experience has not been one to promote blind confidence in
her word. We shall see."</p>

<p>Jolyon got up.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said curtly.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," returned Soames; and Jolyon went out trying to
understand the look, half-startled, half-menacing, on his cousin's
face. He sought Waterloo Station in a disturbed frame of mind, as
though the skin of his moral being had been scraped; and all the
way down in the train he thought of Irene in her lonely flat, and
of Soames in his lonely office, and of the strange paralysis of
life that lay on them both. 'In chancery!' he thought. 'Both their
necks in chancery&mdash;and her's so pretty!'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX&mdash;VAL HEARS THE NEWS</h3>

<p>The keeping of engagements had not as yet been a conspicuous
feature in the life of young Val Dartie, so that when he broke two
and kept one, it was the latter event which caused him, if
anything, the greater surprise, while jogging back to town from
Robin Hill after his ride with Holly. She had been even prettier
than he had thought her yesterday, on her silver-roan, long-tailed
'palfrey'; and it seemed to him, self-critical in the brumous
October gloaming and the outskirts of London, that only his boots
had shone throughout their two-hour companionship. He took out his
new gold 'hunter'&mdash;present from James&mdash;and looked not at
the time, but at sections of his face in the glittering back of its
opened case. He had a temporary spot over one eyebrow, and it
displeased him, for it must have displeased her. Crum never had any
spots. Together with Crum rose the scene in the promenade of the
Pandemonium. To-day he had not had the faintest desire to unbosom
himself to Holly about his father. His father lacked poetry, the
stirrings of which he was feeling for the first time in his
nineteen years. The Liberty, with Cynthia Dark, that almost
mythical embodiment of rapture; the Pandemonium, with the woman of
uncertain age&mdash;both seemed to Val completely 'off,' fresh from
communion with this new, shy, dark-haired young cousin of his. She
rode 'Jolly well,' too, so that it had been all the more flattering
that she had let him lead her where he would in the long gallops of
Richmond Park, though she knew them so much better than he did.
Looking back on it all, he was mystified by the barrenness of his
speech; he felt that he could say 'an awful lot of fetching things'
if he had but the chance again, and the thought that he must go
back to Littlehampton on the morrow, and to Oxford on the
twelfth&mdash;'to that beastly exam,' too&mdash;without the
faintest chance of first seeing her again, caused darkness to
settle on his spirit even more quickly than on the evening. He
should write to her, however, and she had promised to answer.
Perhaps, too, she would come up to Oxford to see her brother. That
thought was like the first star, which came out as he rode into
Padwick's livery stables in the purlieus of Sloane Square. He got
off and stretched himself luxuriously, for he had ridden some
twenty-five good miles. The Dartie within him made him chaffer for
five minutes with young Padwick concerning the favourite for the
Cambridgeshire; then with the words, "Put the gee down to my
account," he walked away, a little wide at the knees, and flipping
his boots with his knotty little cane. 'I don't feel a bit inclined
to go out,' he thought. 'I wonder if mother will stand fizz for my
last night!' With 'fizz' and recollection, he could well pass a
domestic evening.</p>

<p>When he came down, speckless after his bath, he found his mother
scrupulous in a low evening dress, and, to his annoyance, his Uncle
Soames. They stopped talking when he came in; then his uncle
said:</p>

<p>"He'd better be told."</p>

<p>At those words, which meant something about his father, of
course, Val's first thought was of Holly. Was it anything beastly?
His mother began speaking.</p>

<p>"Your father," she said in her fashionably appointed voice,
while her fingers plucked rather pitifully at sea-green brocade,
"your father, my dear boy, has&mdash;is not at Newmarket; he's on
his way to South America. He&mdash;he's left us."</p>

<p>Val looked from her to Soames. Left them! Was he sorry? Was he
fond of his father? It seemed to him that he did not know. Then,
suddenly&mdash;as at a whiff of gardenias and cigars&mdash;his
heart twitched within him, and he was sorry. One's father belonged
to one, could not go off in this fashion&mdash;it was not done! Nor
had he always been the 'bounder' of the Pandemonium promenade.
There were precious memories of tailors' shops and horses, tips at
school, and general lavish kindness, when in luck.</p>

<p>"But why?" he said. Then, as a sportsman himself, was sorry he
had asked. The mask of his mother's face was all disturbed; and he
burst out:</p>

<p>"All right, Mother, don't tell me! Only, what does it mean?"</p>

<p>"A divorce, Val, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>Val uttered a queer little grunt, and looked quickly at his
uncle&mdash;that uncle whom he had been taught to look on as a
guarantee against the consequences of having a father, even against
the Dartie blood in his own veins. The flat-checked visage seemed
to wince, and this upset him.</p>

<p>"It won't be public, will it?"</p>

<p>So vividly before him had come recollection of his own eyes
glued to the unsavoury details of many a divorce suit in the Public
Press.</p>

<p>"Can't it be done quietly somehow? It's so disgusting
for&mdash;for mother, and&mdash;and everybody."</p>

<p>"Everything will be done as quietly as it can, you may be
sure."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but, why is it necessary at all? Mother doesn't want
to marry again."</p>

<p>Himself, the girls, their name tarnished in the sight of his
schoolfellows and of Crum, of the men at Oxford, of&mdash;Holly!
Unbearable! What was to be gained by it?</p>

<p>"Do you, Mother?" he said sharply.</p>

<p>Thus brought face to face with so much of her own feeling by the
one she loved best in the world, Winifred rose from the Empire
chair in which she had been sitting. She saw that her son would be
against her unless he was told everything; and, yet, how could she
tell him? Thus, still plucking at the green brocade, she stared at
Soames. Val, too, stared at Soames. Surely this embodiment of
respectability and the sense of property could not wish to bring
such a slur on his own sister!</p>

<p>Soames slowly passed a little inlaid paperknife over the smooth
surface of a marqueterie table; then, without looking at his
nephew, he began:</p>

<p>"You don't understand what your mother has had to put up with
these twenty years. This is only the last straw, Val." And glancing
up sideways at Winifred, he added:</p>

<p>"Shall I tell him?"</p>

<p>Winifred was silent. If he were not told, he would be against
her! Yet, how dreadful to be told such things of his own father!
Clenching her lips, she nodded.</p>

<p>Soames spoke in a rapid, even voice:</p>

<p>"He has always been a burden round your mother's neck. She has
paid his debts over and over again; he has often been drunk, abused
and threatened her; and now he is gone to Buenos Aires with a
dancer." And, as if distrusting the efficacy of those words on the
boy, he went on quickly:</p>

<p>"He took your mother's pearls to give to her."</p>

<p>Val jerked up his hand, then. At that signal of distress
Winifred cried out:</p>

<p>"That'll do, Soames&mdash;stop!"</p>

<p>In the boy, the Dartie and the Forsyte were struggling. For
debts, drink, dancers, he had a certain sympathy; but the
pearls&mdash;no! That was too much! And suddenly he found his
mother's hand squeezing his.</p>

<p>"You see," he heard Soames say, "we can't have it all begin over
again. There's a limit; we must strike while the iron's hot."</p>

<p>Val freed his hand.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you're&mdash;never going to bring out that about the
pearls! I couldn't stand that&mdash;I simply couldn't!"</p>

<p>Winifred cried out:</p>

<p>"No, no, Val&mdash;oh no! That's only to show you how impossible
your father is!" And his uncle nodded. Somewhat assuaged, Val took
out a cigarette. His father had bought him that thin curved case.
Oh! it was unbearable&mdash;just as he was going up to Oxford!</p>

<p>"Can't mother be protected without?" he said. "I could look
after her. It could always be done later if it was really
necessary."</p>

<p>A smile played for a moment round Soames' lips, and became
bitter.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you're talking of; nothing's so fatal as
delay in such matters."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I tell you, boy, nothing's so fatal. I know from
experience."</p>

<p>His voice had the ring of exasperation. Val regarded him
round-eyed, never having known his uncle express any sort of
feeling. Oh! Yes&mdash;he remembered now&mdash;there had been an
Aunt Irene, and something had happened&mdash;something which people
kept dark; he had heard his father once use an unmentionable word
of her.</p>

<p>"I don't want to speak ill of your father," Soames went on
doggedly, "but I know him well enough to be sure that he'll be back
on your mother's hands before a year's over. You can imagine what
that will mean to her and to all of you after this. The only thing
is to cut the knot for good."</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Val was impressed; and, happening to look
at his mother's face, he got what was perhaps his first real
insight into the fact that his own feelings were not always what
mattered most.</p>

<p>"All right, mother," he said; "we'll back you up. Only I'd like
to know when it'll be. It's my first term, you know. I don't want
to be up there when it comes off."</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear boy," murmured Winifred, "it is a bore for you."
So, by habit, she phrased what, from the expression of her face,
was the most poignant regret. "When will it be, Soames?"</p>

<p>"Can't tell&mdash;not for months. We must get restitution
first."</p>

<p>'What the deuce is that?' thought Val. 'What silly brutes
lawyers are! Not for months! I know one thing: I'm not going to
dine in!' And he said:</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry, mother, I've got to go out to dinner now."</p>

<p>Though it was his last night, Winifred nodded almost gratefully;
they both felt that they had gone quite far enough in the
expression of feeling.</p>

<p>Val sought the misty freedom of Green Street, reckless and
depressed. And not till he reached Piccadilly did he discover that
he had only eighteen-pence. One couldn't dine off eighteen-pence,
and he was very hungry. He looked longingly at the windows of the
Iseeum Club, where he had often eaten of the best with his father!
Those pearls! There was no getting over them! But the more he
brooded and the further he walked the hungrier he naturally became.
Short of trailing home, there were only two places where he could
go&mdash;his grandfather's in Park Lane, and Timothy's in the
Bayswater Road. Which was the less deplorable? At his grandfather's
he would probably get a better dinner on the spur of the moment. At
Timothy's they gave you a jolly good feed when they expected you,
not otherwise. He decided on Park Lane, not unmoved by the thought
that to go up to Oxford without affording his grandfather a chance
to tip him was hardly fair to either of them. His mother would hear
he had been there, of course, and might think it funny; but he
couldn't help that. He rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Warmson, any dinner for me, d'you think?"</p>

<p>"They're just going in, Master Val. Mr. Forsyte will be very
glad to see you. He was saying at lunch that he never saw you
nowadays."</p>

<p>Val grinned.</p>

<p>"Well, here I am. Kill the fatted calf, Warmson, let's have
fizz."</p>

<p>Warmson smiled faintly&mdash;in his opinion Val was a young
limb.</p>

<p>"I will ask Mrs. Forsyte, Master Val."</p>

<p>"I say," Val grumbled, taking off his overcoat, "I'm not at
school any more, you know."</p>

<p>Warmson, not without a sense of humour, opened the door beyond
the stag's-horn coat stand, with the words:</p>

<p>"Mr. Valerus, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Confound him!" thought Val, entering.</p>

<p>A warm embrace, a "Well, Val!" from Emily, and a rather quavery
"So there you are at last!" from James, restored his sense of
dignity.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you let us know? There's only saddle of mutton.
Champagne, Warmson," said Emily. And they went in.</p>

<p>At the great dining-table, shortened to its utmost, under which
so many fashionable legs had rested, James sat at one end, Emily at
the other, Val half-way between them; and something of the
loneliness of his grandparents, now that all their four children
were flown, reached the boy's spirit. 'I hope I shall kick the
bucket long before I'm as old as grandfather,' he thought. 'Poor
old chap, he's as thin as a rail!' And lowering his voice while his
grandfather and Warmson were in discussion about sugar in the soup,
he said to Emily:</p>

<p>"It's pretty brutal at home, Granny. I suppose you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear boy."</p>

<p>"Uncle Soames was there when I left. I say, isn't there anything
to be done to prevent a divorce? Why is he so beastly keen on
it?"</p>

<p>"Hush, my dear!" murmured Emily; "we're keeping it from your
grandfather."</p>

<p>James' voice sounded from the other end.</p>

<p>"What's that? What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"About Val's college," returned Emily. "Young Pariser was there,
James; you remember&mdash;he nearly broke the Bank at Monte Carlo
afterwards."</p>

<p>James muttered that he did not know&mdash;Val must look after
himself up there, or he'd get into bad ways. And he looked at his
grandson with gloom, out of which affection distrustfully
glimmered.</p>

<p>"What I'm afraid of," said Val to his plate, "is of being hard
up, you know."</p>

<p>By instinct he knew that the weak spot in that old man was fear
of insecurity for his grandchildren.</p>

<p>"Well," said James, and the soup in his spoon dribbled over,
"you'll have a good allowance; but you must keep within it."</p>

<p>"Of course," murmured Val; "if it is good. How much will it be,
Grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Three hundred and fifty; it's too much. I had next to nothing
at your age."</p>

<p>Val sighed. He had hoped for four, and been afraid of three. "I
don't know what your young cousin has," said James; "he's up there.
His father's a rich man."</p>

<p>"Aren't you?" asked Val hardily.</p>

<p>"I?" replied James, flustered. "I've got so many expenses. Your
father..." and he was silent.</p>

<p>"Cousin Jolyon's got an awfully jolly place. I went down there
with Uncle Soames&mdash;ripping stables."</p>

<p>"Ah!" murmured James profoundly. "That house&mdash;I knew how it
would be!" And he lapsed into gloomy meditation over his
fish-bones. His son's tragedy, and the deep cleavage it had caused
in the Forsyte family, had still the power to draw him down into a
whirlpool of doubts and misgivings. Val, who hankered to talk of
Robin Hill, because Robin Hill meant Holly, turned to Emily and
said:</p>

<p>"Was that the house built for Uncle Soames?" And, receiving her
nod, went on: "I wish you'd tell me about him, Granny. What became
of Aunt Irene? Is she still going? He seems awfully worked-up about
something to-night."</p>

<p>Emily laid her finger on her lips, but the word Irene had caught
James' ear.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he said, staying a piece of mutton close to his
lips. "Who's been seeing her? I knew we hadn't heard the last of
that."</p>

<p>"Now, James," said Emily, "eat your dinner. Nobody's been seeing
anybody."</p>

<p>James put down his fork.</p>

<p>"There you go," he said. "I might die before you'd tell me of
it. Is Soames getting a divorce?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Emily with incomparable aplomb; "Soames is much
too sensible."</p>

<p>James had sought his own throat, gathering the long white
whiskers together on the skin and bone of it.</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she was always..." he said, and with that enigmatic
remark the conversation lapsed, for Warmson had returned. But
later, when the saddle of mutton had been succeeded by sweet,
savoury, and dessert, and Val had received a cheque for twenty
pounds and his grandfather's kiss&mdash;like no other kiss in the
world, from lips pushed out with a sort of fearful suddenness, as
if yielding to weakness&mdash;he returned to the charge in the
hall.</p>

<p>"Tell us about Uncle Soames, Granny. Why is he so keen on
mother's getting a divorce?"</p>

<p>"Your Uncle Soames," said Emily, and her voice had in it an
exaggerated assurance, "is a lawyer, my dear boy. He's sure to know
best."</p>

<p>"Is he?" muttered Val. "But what did become of Aunt Irene? I
remember she was jolly good-looking."</p>

<p>"She&mdash;er..." said Emily, "behaved very badly. We don't talk
about it."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want everybody at Oxford to know about our
affairs," ejaculated Val; "it's a brutal idea. Why couldn't father
be prevented without its being made public?"</p>

<p>Emily sighed. She had always lived rather in an atmosphere of
divorce, owing to her fashionable proclivities&mdash;so many of
those whose legs had been under her table having gained a certain
notoriety. When, however, it touched her own family, she liked it
no better than other people. But she was eminently practical, and a
woman of courage, who never pursued a shadow in preference to its
substance.</p>

<p>"Your mother," she said, "will be happier if she's quite free,
Val. Good-night, my dear boy; and don't wear loud waistcoats up at
Oxford, they're not the thing just now. Here's a little
present."</p>

<p>With another five pounds in his hand, and a little warmth in his
heart, for he was fond of his grandmother, he went out into Park
Lane. A wind had cleared the mist, the autumn leaves were rustling,
and the stars were shining. With all that money in his pocket an
impulse to 'see life' beset him; but he had not gone forty yards in
the direction of Piccadilly when Holly's shy face, and her eyes
with an imp dancing in their gravity, came up before him, and his
hand seemed to be tingling again from the pressure of her warm
gloved hand. 'No, dash it!' he thought, 'I'm going home!'</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER X&mdash;SOAMES ENTERTAINS THE FUTURE</h3>

<p>It was full late for the river, but the weather was lovely, and
summer lingered below the yellowing leaves. Soames took many looks
at the day from his riverside garden near Mapledurham that Sunday
morning.</p>

<p>With his own hands he put flowers about his little house-boat,
and equipped the punt, in which, after lunch, he proposed to take
them on the river. Placing those Chinese-looking cushions, he could
not tell whether or no he wished to take Annette alone. She was so
very pretty&mdash;could he trust himself not to say irrevocable
words, passing beyond the limits of discretion? Roses on the
veranda were still in bloom, and the hedges ever-green, so that
there was almost nothing of middle-aged autumn to chill the mood;
yet was he nervous, fidgety, strangely distrustful of his powers to
steer just the right course. This visit had been planned to produce
in Annette and her mother a due sense of his possessions, so that
they should be ready to receive with respect any overture he might
later be disposed to make. He dressed with great care, making
himself neither too young nor too old, very thankful that his hair
was still thick and smooth and had no grey in it. Three times he
went up to his picture-gallery. If they had any knowledge at all,
they must see at once that his collection alone was worth at least
thirty thousand pounds. He minutely inspected, too, the pretty
bedroom overlooking the river where they would take off their hats.
It would be her bedroom if&mdash;if the matter went through, and
she became his wife. Going up to the dressing-table he passed his
hand over the lilac-coloured pincushion, into which were stuck all
kinds of pins; a bowl of pot-pourri exhaled a scent that made his
head turn just a little. His wife! If only the whole thing could be
settled out of hand, and there was not the nightmare of this
divorce to be gone through first; and with gloom puckered on his
forehead, he looked out at the river shining beyond the roses and
the lawn. Madame Lamotte would never resist this prospect for her
child; Annette would never resist her mother. If only he were free!
He drove to the station to meet them. What taste Frenchwomen had!
Madame Lamotte was in black with touches of lilac colour, Annette
in greyish lilac linen, with cream coloured gloves and hat. Rather
pale she looked and Londony; and her blue eyes were demure. Waiting
for them to come down to lunch, Soames stood in the open
french-window of the diningroom moved by that sensuous delight in
sunshine and flowers and trees which only came to the full when
youth and beauty were there to share it with one. He had ordered
the lunch with intense consideration; the wine was a very special
Sauterne, the whole appointments of the meal perfect, the coffee
served on the veranda super-excellent. Madame Lamotte accepted
creme de menthe; Annette refused. Her manners were charming, with
just a suspicion of 'the conscious beauty' creeping into them.
'Yes,' thought Soames, 'another year of London and that sort of
life, and she'll be spoiled.'</p>

<p>Madame was in sedate French raptures. "Adorable! Le soleil est
si bon! How everything is chic, is it not, Annette? Monsieur is a
real Monte Cristo." Annette murmured assent, with a look up at
Soames which he could not read. He proposed a turn on the river.
But to punt two persons when one of them looked so ravishing on
those Chinese cushions was merely to suffer from a sense of lost
opportunity; so they went but a short way towards Pangbourne,
drifting slowly back, with every now and then an autumn leaf
dropping on Annette or on her mother's black amplitude. And Soames
was not happy, worried by the thought:
'How&mdash;when&mdash;where&mdash;can I say&mdash;what?' They did
not yet even know that he was married. To tell them he was married
might jeopardise his every chance; yet, if he did not definitely
make them understand that he wished for Annette's hand, it would be
dropping into some other clutch before he was free to claim it.</p>

<p>At tea, which they both took with lemon, Soames spoke of the
Transvaal.</p>

<p>"There'll be war," he said.</p>

<p>Madame Lamotte lamented.</p>

<p>"Ces pauvres gens bergers!" Could they not be left to
themselves?</p>

<p>Soames smiled&mdash;the question seemed to him absurd.</p>

<p>Surely as a woman of business she understood that the British
could not abandon their legitimate commercial interests.</p>

<p>"Ah! that!" But Madame Lamotte found that the English were a
little hypocrite. They were talking of justice and the Uitlanders,
not of business. Monsieur was the first who had spoken to her of
that.</p>

<p>"The Boers are only half-civilised," remarked Soames; "they
stand in the way of progress. It will never do to let our
suzerainty go."</p>

<p>"What does that mean to say? Suzerainty!"</p>

<p>"What a strange word!" Soames became eloquent, roused by these
threats to the principle of possession, and stimulated by Annette's
eyes fixed on him. He was delighted when presently she said:</p>

<p>"I think Monsieur is right. They should be taught a lesson." She
was sensible!</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, "we must act with moderation. I'm no
jingo. We must be firm without bullying. Will you come up and see
my pictures?" Moving from one to another of these treasures, he
soon perceived that they knew nothing. They passed his last Mauve,
that remarkable study of a 'Hay-cart going Home,' as if it were a
lithograph. He waited almost with awe to see how they would view
the jewel of his collection&mdash;an Israels whose price he had
watched ascending till he was now almost certain it had reached top
value, and would be better on the market again. They did not view
it at all. This was a shock; and yet to have in Annette a virgin
taste to form would be better than to have the silly, half-baked
predilections of the English middle-class to deal with. At the end
of the gallery was a Meissonier of which he was rather
ashamed&mdash;Meissonier was so steadily going down. Madame Lamotte
stopped before it.</p>

<p>"Meissonier! Ah! What a jewel!" Soames took advantage of that
moment. Very gently touching Annette's arm, he said:</p>

<p>"How do you like my place, Annette?"</p>

<p>She did not shrink, did not respond; she looked at him full,
looked down, and murmured:</p>

<p>"Who would not like it? It is so beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps some day&mdash;" Soames said, and stopped.</p>

<p>So pretty she was, so self-possessed&mdash;she frightened him.
Those cornflower-blue eyes, the turn of that creamy neck, her
delicate curves&mdash;she was a standing temptation to
indiscretion! No! No! One must be sure of one's ground&mdash;much
surer! 'If I hold off,' he thought, 'it will tantalise her.' And he
crossed over to Madame Lamotte, who was still in front of the
Meissonier.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's quite a good example of his later work. You must
come again, Madame, and see them lighted up. You must both come and
spend a night."</p>

<p>Enchanted, would it not be beautiful to see them lighted? By
moonlight too, the river must be ravishing!</p>

<p>Annette murmured:</p>

<p>"Thou art sentimental, Maman!"</p>

<p>Sentimental! That black-robed, comely, substantial Frenchwoman
of the world! And suddenly he was certain as he could be that there
was no sentiment in either of them. All the better. Of what use
sentiment? And yet...!</p>

<p>He drove to the station with them, and saw them into the train.
To the tightened pressure of his hand it seemed that Annette's
fingers responded just a little; her face smiled at him through the
dark.</p>

<p>He went back to the carriage, brooding. "Go on home, Jordan," he
said to the coachman; "I'll walk." And he strode out into the
darkening lanes, caution and the desire of possession playing
see-saw within him. 'Bon soir, monsieur!' How softly she had said
it. To know what was in her mind! The French&mdash;they were like
cats&mdash;one could tell nothing! But&mdash;how pretty! What a
perfect young thing to hold in one's arms! What a mother for his
heir! And he thought, with a smile, of his family and their
surprise at a French wife, and their curiosity, and of the way he
would play with it and buffet it confound them!</p>

<p>The poplars sighed in the darkness; an owl hooted. Shadows
deepened in the water. 'I will and must be free,' he thought. 'I
won't hang about any longer. I'll go and see Irene. If you want
things done, do them yourself. I must live again&mdash;live and
move and have my being.' And in echo to that queer biblicality
church-bells chimed the call to evening prayer.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER XI&mdash;AND VISITS THE PAST</h3>

<p>On a Tuesday evening after dining at his club Soames set out to
do what required more courage and perhaps less delicacy than
anything he had yet undertaken in his life&mdash;save perhaps his
birth, and one other action. He chose the evening, indeed, partly
because Irene was more likely to be in, but mainly because he had
failed to find sufficient resolution by daylight, had needed wine
to give him extra daring.</p>

<p>He left his hansom on the Embankment, and walked up to the Old
Church, uncertain of the block of flats where he knew she lived. He
found it hiding behind a much larger mansion; and having read the
name, 'Mrs. Irene Heron'&mdash;Heron, forsooth! Her maiden name: so
she used that again, did she?&mdash;he stepped back into the road
to look up at the windows of the first floor. Light was coming
through in the corner fiat, and he could hear a piano being played.
He had never had a love of music, had secretly borne it a grudge in
the old days when so often she had turned to her piano, making of
it a refuge place into which she knew he could not enter. Repulse!
The long repulse, at first restrained and secret, at last open!
Bitter memory came with that sound. It must be she playing, and
thus almost assured of seeing her, he stood more undecided than
ever. Shivers of anticipation ran through him; his tongue felt dry,
his heart beat fast. 'I have no cause to be afraid,' he thought.
And then the lawyer stirred within him. Was he doing a foolish
thing? Ought he not to have arranged a formal meeting in the
presence of her trustee? No! Not before that fellow Jolyon, who
sympathised with her! Never! He crossed back into the doorway, and,
slowly, to keep down the beating of his heart, mounted the single
flight of stairs and rang the bell. When the door was opened to him
his sensations were regulated by the scent which came&mdash;that
perfume&mdash;from away back in the past, bringing muffled
remembrance: fragrance of a drawing-room he used to enter, of a
house he used to own&mdash;perfume of dried rose-leaves and
honey!</p>

<p>"Say, Mr. Forsyte," he said, "your mistress will see me, I
know." He had thought this out; she would think it was Jolyon!</p>

<p>When the maid was gone and he was alone in the tiny hall, where
the light was dim from one pearly-shaded sconce, and walls, carpet,
everything was silvery, making the walled-in space all ghostly, he
could only think ridiculously: 'Shall I go in with my overcoat on,
or take it off?' The music ceased; the maid said from the
doorway:</p>

<p>"Will you walk in, sir?"</p>

<p>Soames walked in. He noted mechanically that all was still
silvery, and that the upright piano was of satinwood. She had risen
and stood recoiled against it; her hand, placed on the keys as if
groping for support, had struck a sudden discord, held for a
moment, and released. The light from the shaded piano-candle fell
on her neck, leaving her face rather in shadow. She was in a black
evening dress, with a sort of mantilla over her shoulders&mdash;he
did not remember ever having seen her in black, and the thought
passed through him: 'She dresses even when she's alone.'</p>

<p>"You!" he heard her whisper.</p>

<p>Many times Soames had rehearsed this scene in fancy. Rehearsal
served him not at all. He simply could not speak. He had never
thought that the sight of this woman whom he had once so
passionately desired, so completely owned, and whom he had not seen
for twelve years, could affect him in this way. He had imagined
himself speaking and acting, half as man of business, half as
judge. And now it was as if he were in the presence not of a mere
woman and erring wife, but of some force, subtle and elusive as
atmosphere itself within him and outside. A kind of defensive irony
welled up in him.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a queer visit! I hope you're well."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Will you sit down?"</p>

<p>She had moved away from the piano, and gone over to a
window-seat, sinking on to it, with her hands clasped in her lap.
Light fell on her there, so that Soames could see her face, eyes,
hair, strangely as he remembered them, strangely beautiful.</p>

<p>He sat down on the edge of a satinwood chair, upholstered with
silver-coloured stuff, close to where he was standing.</p>

<p>"You have not changed," he said.</p>

<p>"No? What have you come for?"</p>

<p>"To discuss things."</p>

<p>"I have heard what you want from your cousin."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I am willing. I have always been."</p>

<p>The sound of her voice, reserved and close, the sight of her
figure watchfully poised, defensive, was helping him now. A
thousand memories of her, ever on the watch against him, stirred,
and...</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will be good enough, then, to give me information
on which I can act. The law must be complied with."</p>

<p>"I have none to give you that you don't know of."</p>

<p>"Twelve years! Do you suppose I can believe that?"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you will believe anything I say; but it's the
truth."</p>

<p>Soames looked at her hard. He had said that she had not changed;
now he perceived that she had. Not in face, except that it was more
beautiful; not in form, except that it was a little
fuller&mdash;no! She had changed spiritually. There was more of
her, as it were, something of activity and daring, where there had
been sheer passive resistance. 'Ah!' he thought, 'that's her
independent income! Confound Uncle Jolyon!'</p>

<p>"I suppose you're comfortably off now?" he said.</p>

<p>"Thank you, yes."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you let me provide for you? I would have, in spite
of everything."</p>

<p>A faint smile came on her lips; but she did not answer.</p>

<p>"You are still my wife," said Soames. Why he said that, what he
meant by it, he knew neither when he spoke nor after. It was a
truism almost preposterous, but its effect was startling. She rose
from the window-seat, and stood for a moment perfectly still,
looking at him. He could see her bosom heaving. Then she turned to
the window and threw it open.</p>

<p>"Why do that?" he said sharply. "You'll catch cold in that
dress. I'm not dangerous." And he uttered a little sad laugh.</p>

<p>She echoed it&mdash;faintly, bitterly.</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;habit."</p>

<p>"Rather odd habit," said Soames as bitterly. "Shut the
window!"</p>

<p>She shut it and sat down again. She had developed power, this
woman&mdash;this&mdash;wife of his! He felt it issuing from her as
she sat there, in a sort of armour. And almost unconsciously he
rose and moved nearer; he wanted to see the expression on her face.
Her eyes met his unflinching. Heavens! how clear they were, and
what a dark brown against that white skin, and that burnt-amber
hair! And how white her shoulders.</p>

<p>Funny sensation this! He ought to hate her.</p>

<p>"You had better tell me," he said; "it's to your advantage to be
free as well as to mine. That old matter is too old."</p>

<p>"I have told you."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me there has been
nothing&mdash;nobody?"</p>

<p>"Nobody. You must go to your own life."</p>

<p>Stung by that retort, Soames moved towards the piano and back to
the hearth, to and fro, as he had been wont in the old days in
their drawing-room when his feelings were too much for him.</p>

<p>"That won't do," he said. "You deserted me. In common justice
it's for you..."</p>

<p>He saw her shrug those white shoulders, heard her murmur:</p>

<p>"Yes. Why didn't you divorce me then? Should I have cared?"</p>

<p>He stopped, and looked at her intently with a sort of curiosity.
What on earth did she do with herself, if she really lived quite
alone? And why had he not divorced her? The old feeling that she
had never understood him, never done him justice, bit him while he
stared at her.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you have made me a good wife?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes; it was a crime to marry you. I have paid for it. You will
find some way perhaps. You needn't mind my name, I have none to
lose. Now I think you had better go."</p>

<p>A sense of defeat&mdash;of being defrauded of his
self-justification, and of something else beyond power of
explanation to himself, beset Soames like the breath of a cold fog.
Mechanically he reached up, took from the mantel-shelf a little
china bowl, reversed it, and said:</p>

<p>"Lowestoft. Where did you get this? I bought its fellow at
Jobson's." And, visited by the sudden memory of how, those many
years ago, he and she had bought china together, he remained
staring at the little bowl, as if it contained all the past. Her
voice roused him.</p>

<p>"Take it. I don't want it."</p>

<p>Soames put it back on the shelf.</p>

<p>"Will you shake hands?" he said.</p>

<p>A faint smile curved her lips. She held out her hand. It was
cold to his rather feverish touch. 'She's made of ice,' he
thought&mdash;'she was always made of ice!' But even as that
thought darted through him, his senses were assailed by the perfume
of her dress and body, as though the warmth within her, which had
never been for him, were struggling to show its presence. And he
turned on his heel. He walked out and away, as if someone with a
whip were after him, not even looking for a cab, glad of the empty
Embankment and the cold river, and the thick-strewn shadows of the
plane-tree leaves&mdash;confused, flurried, sore at heart, and
vaguely disturbed, as though he had made some deep mistake whose
consequences he could not foresee. And the fantastic thought
suddenly assailed him if instead of, 'I think you had better go,'
she had said, 'I think you had better stay!' What should he have
felt, what would he have done? That cursed attraction of her was
there for him even now, after all these years of estrangement and
bitter thoughts. It was there, ready to mount to his head at a
sign, a touch. 'I was a fool to go!' he muttered. 'I've advanced
nothing. Who could imagine? I never thought!' Memory, flown back to
the first years of his marriage, played him torturing tricks. She
had not deserved to keep her beauty&mdash;the beauty he had owned
and known so well. And a kind of bitterness at the tenacity of his
own admiration welled up in him. Most men would have hated the
sight of her, as she had deserved. She had spoiled his life,
wounded his pride to death, defrauded him of a son. And yet the
mere sight of her, cold and resisting as ever, had this power to
upset him utterly! It was some damned magnetism she had! And no
wonder if, as she asserted; she had lived untouched these last
twelve years. So Bosinney&mdash;cursed be his memory!&mdash;had
lived on all this time with her! Soames could not tell whether he
was glad of that knowledge or no.</p>

<p>Nearing his Club at last he stopped to buy a paper. A headline
ran: 'Boers reported to repudiate suzerainty!' Suzerainty! 'Just
like her!' he thought: 'she always did. Suzerainty! I still have it
by rights. She must be awfully lonely in that wretched little
flat!'</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER XII&mdash;ON FORSYTE 'CHANGE</h3>

<p>Soames belonged to two clubs, 'The Connoisseurs,' which he put
on his cards and seldom visited, and 'The Remove,' which he did not
put on his cards and frequented. He had joined this Liberal
institution five years ago, having made sure that its members were
now nearly all sound Conservatives in heart and pocket, if not in
principle. Uncle Nicholas had put him up. The fine reading-room was
decorated in the Adam style.</p>

<p>On entering that evening he glanced at the tape for any news
about the Transvaal, and noted that Consols were down
seven-sixteenths since the morning. He was turning away to seek the
reading-room when a voice behind him said:</p>

<p>"Well, Soames, that went off all right."</p>

<p>It was Uncle Nicholas, in a frock-coat and his special cut-away
collar, with a black tie passed through a ring. Heavens! How young
and dapper he looked at eighty-two!</p>

<p>"I think Roger'd have been pleased," his uncle went on. "The
thing was very well done. Blackley's? I'll make a note of them.
Buxton's done me no good. These Boers are upsetting me&mdash;that
fellow Chamberlain's driving the country into war. What do you
think?"</p>

<p>"Bound to come," murmured Soames.</p>

<p>Nicholas passed his hand over his thin, clean-shaven cheeks,
very rosy after his summer cure; a slight pout had gathered on his
lips. This business had revived all his Liberal principles.</p>

<p>"I mistrust that chap; he's a stormy petrel. House-property will
go down if there's war. You'll have trouble with Roger's estate. I
often told him he ought to get out of some of his houses. He was an
opinionated beggar."</p>

<p>'There was a pair of you!' thought Soames. But he never argued
with an uncle, in that way preserving their opinion of him as 'a
long-headed chap,' and the legal care of their property.</p>

<p>"They tell me at Timothy's," said Nicholas, lowering his voice,
"that Dartie has gone off at last. That'll be a relief to your
father. He was a rotten egg."</p>

<p>Again Soames nodded. If there was a subject on which the
Forsytes really agreed, it was the character of Montague
Dartie.</p>

<p>"You take care," said Nicholas, "or he'll turn up again.
Winifred had better have the tooth out, I should say. No use
preserving what's gone bad."</p>

<p>Soames looked at him sideways. His nerves, exacerbated by the
interview he had just come through, disposed him to see a personal
allusion in those words.</p>

<p>"I'm advising her," he said shortly.</p>

<p>"Well," said Nicholas, "the brougham's waiting; I must get home.
I'm very poorly. Remember me to your father."</p>

<p>And having thus reconsecrated the ties of blood, he passed down
the steps at his youthful gait and was wrapped into his fur coat by
the junior porter.</p>

<p>'I've never known Uncle Nicholas other than "very poorly,"'
mused Soames, 'or seen him look other than everlasting. What a
family! Judging by him, I've got thirty-eight years of health
before me. Well, I'm not going to waste them.' And going over to a
mirror he stood looking at his face. Except for a line or two, and
three or four grey hairs in his little dark moustache, had he aged
any more than Irene? The prime of life&mdash;he and she in the very
prime of life! And a fantastic thought shot into his mind. Absurd!
Idiotic! But again it came. And genuinely alarmed by the
recurrence, as one is by the second fit of shivering which presages
a feverish cold, he sat down on the weighing machine. Eleven stone!
He had not varied two pounds in twenty years. What age was she?
Nearly thirty-seven&mdash;not too old to have a child&mdash;not at
all! Thirty-seven on the ninth of next month. He remembered her
birthday well&mdash;he had always observed it religiously, even
that last birthday so soon before she left him, when he was almost
certain she was faithless. Four birthdays in his house. He had
looked forward to them, because his gifts had meant a semblance of
gratitude, a certain attempt at warmth. Except, indeed, that last
birthday&mdash;which had tempted him to be too religious! And he
shied away in thought. Memory heaps dead leaves on corpse-like
deeds, from under which they do but vaguely offend the sense. And
then he thought suddenly: 'I could send her a present for her
birthday. After all, we're Christians! Couldn't!&mdash;couldn't we
join up again!' And he uttered a deep sigh sitting there. Annette!
Ah! but between him and Annette was the need for that wretched
divorce suit! And how?</p>

<p>"A man can always work these things, if he'll take it on
himself," Jolyon had said.</p>

<p>But why should he take the scandal on himself with his whole
career as a pillar of the law at stake? It was not fair! It was
quixotic! Twelve years' separation in which he had taken no steps
to free himself put out of court the possibility of using her
conduct with Bosinney as a ground for divorcing her. By doing
nothing to secure relief he had acquiesced, even if the evidence
could now be gathered, which was more than doubtful. Besides, his
own pride would never let him use that old incident, he had
suffered from it too much. No! Nothing but fresh misconduct on her
part&mdash;but she had denied it; and&mdash;almost&mdash;he had
believed her. Hung up! Utterly hung up!</p>

<p>He rose from the scooped-out red velvet seat with a feeling of
constriction about his vitals. He would never sleep with this going
on in him! And, taking coat and hat again, he went out, moving
eastward. In Trafalgar Square he became aware of some special
commotion travelling towards him out of the mouth of the Strand. It
materialised in newspaper men calling out so loudly that no words
whatever could be heard. He stopped to listen, and one came by.</p>

<p>"Payper! Special! Ultimatium by Krooger! Declaration of war!"
Soames bought the paper. There it was in the stop press...! His
first thought was: 'The Boers are committing suicide.' His second:
'Is there anything still I ought to sell?' If so he had missed the
chance&mdash;there would certainly be a slump in the city
to-morrow. He swallowed this thought with a nod of defiance. That
ultimatum was insolent&mdash;sooner than let it pass he was
prepared to lose money. They wanted a lesson, and they would get
it; but it would take three months at least to bring them to heel.
There weren't the troops out there; always behind time, the
Government! Confound those newspaper rats! What was the use of
waking everybody up? Breakfast to-morrow was quite soon enough. And
he thought with alarm of his father. They would cry it down Park
Lane. Hailing a hansom, he got in and told the man to drive
there.</p>

<p>James and Emily had just gone up to bed, and after communicating
the news to Warmson, Soames prepared to follow. He paused by
after-thought to say:</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, Warmson?"</p>

<p>The butler ceased passing a hat brush over the silk hat Soames
had taken off, and, inclining his face a little forward, said in a
low voice: "Well, sir, they 'aven't a chance, of course; but I'm
told they're very good shots. I've got a son in the
Inniskillings."</p>

<p>"You, Warmson? Why, I didn't know you were married."</p>

<p>"No, sir. I don't talk of it. I expect he'll be going out."</p>

<p>The slighter shock Soames had felt on discovering that he knew
so little of one whom he thought he knew so well was lost in the
slight shock of discovering that the war might touch one
personally. Born in the year of the Crimean War, he had only come
to consciousness by the time the Indian Mutiny was over; since then
the many little wars of the British Empire had been entirely
professional, quite unconnected with the Forsytes and all they
stood for in the body politic. This war would surely be no
exception. But his mind ran hastily over his family. Two of the
Haymans, he had heard, were in some Yeomanry or other&mdash;it had
always been a pleasant thought, there was a certain distinction
about the Yeomanry; they wore, or used to wear, a blue uniform with
silver about it, and rode horses. And Archibald, he remembered, had
once on a time joined the Militia, but had given it up because his
father, Nicholas, had made such a fuss about his 'wasting his time
peacocking about in a uniform.' Recently he had heard somewhere
that young Nicholas' eldest, very young Nicholas, had become a
Volunteer. 'No,' thought Soames, mounting the stairs slowly,
'there's nothing in that!'</p>

<p>He stood on the landing outside his parents' bed and dressing
rooms, debating whether or not to put his nose in and say a
reassuring word. Opening the landing window, he listened. The
rumble from Piccadilly was all the sound he heard, and with the
thought, 'If these motor-cars increase, it'll affect house
property,' he was about to pass on up to the room always kept ready
for him when he heard, distant as yet, the hoarse rushing call of a
newsvendor. There it was, and coming past the house! He knocked on
his mother's door and went in.</p>

<p>His father was sitting up in bed, with his ears pricked under
the white hair which Emily kept so beautifully cut. He looked pink,
and extraordinarily clean, in his setting of white sheet and
pillow, out of which the points of his high, thin, nightgowned
shoulders emerged in small peaks. His eyes alone, grey and
distrustful under their withered lids, were moving from the window
to Emily, who in a wrapper was walking up and down, squeezing a
rubber ball attached to a scent bottle. The room reeked faintly of
the eau-de-Cologne she was spraying.</p>

<p>"All right!" said Soames, "it's not a fire. The Boers have
declared war&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>Emily stopped her spraying.</p>

<p>"Oh!" was all she said, and looked at James.</p>

<p>Soames, too, looked at his father. He was taking it differently
from their expectation, as if some thought, strange to them, were
working in him.</p>

<p>"H'm!" he muttered suddenly, "I shan't live to see the end of
this."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, James! It'll be over by Christmas."</p>

<p>"What do you know about it?" James answered her with asperity.
"It's a pretty mess at this time of night, too!" He lapsed into
silence, and his wife and son, as if hypnotised, waited for him to
say: 'I can't tell&mdash;I don't know; I knew how it would be!' But
he did not. The grey eyes shifted, evidently seeing nothing in the
room; then movement occurred under the bedclothes, and the knees
were drawn up suddenly to a great height.</p>

<p>"They ought to send out Roberts. It all comes from that fellow
Gladstone and his Majuba."</p>

<p>The two listeners noted something beyond the usual in his voice,
something of real anxiety. It was as if he had said: 'I shall never
see the old country peaceful and safe again. I shall have to die
before I know she's won.' And in spite of the feeling that James
must not be encouraged to be fussy, they were touched. Soames went
up to the bedside and stroked his father's hand which had emerged
from under the bedclothes, long and wrinkled with veins.</p>

<p>"Mark my words!" said James, "consols will go to par. For all I
know, Val may go and enlist."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, James!" cried Emily, "you talk as if there were
danger."</p>

<p>Her comfortable voice seemed to soothe James for once.</p>

<p>"Well," he muttered, "I told you how it would be. I don't know,
I'm sure&mdash;nobody tells me anything. Are you sleeping here, my
boy?"</p>

<p>The crisis was past, he would now compose himself to his normal
degree of anxiety; and, assuring his father that he was sleeping in
the house, Soames pressed his hand, and went up to his room.</p>

<p>The following afternoon witnessed the greatest crowd Timothy's
had known for many a year. On national occasions, such as this, it
was, indeed, almost impossible to avoid going there. Not that there
was any danger or rather only just enough to make it necessary to
assure each other that there was none.</p>

<p>Nicholas was there early. He had seen Soames the night
before&mdash;Soames had said it was bound to come. This old Kruger
was in his dotage&mdash;why, he must be seventy-five if he was a
day!</p>

<p>(Nicholas was eighty-two.) What had Timothy said? He had had a
fit after Majuba. These Boers were a grasping lot! The dark-haired
Francie, who had arrived on his heels, with the contradictious
touch which became the free spirit of a daughter of Roger, chimed
in:</p>

<p>"Kettle and pot, Uncle Nicholas. What price the Uitlanders?"
What price, indeed! A new expression, and believed to be due to her
brother George.</p>

<p>Aunt Juley thought Francie ought not to say such a thing. Dear
Mrs. MacAnder's boy, Charlie MacAnder, was one, and no one could
call him grasping. At this Francie uttered one of her mots,
scandalising, and so frequently repeated:</p>

<p>"Well, his father's a Scotchman, and his mother's a cat."</p>

<p>Aunt Juley covered her ears, too late, but Aunt Hester smiled;
as for Nicholas, he pouted&mdash;witticism of which he was not the
author was hardly to his taste. Just then Marian Tweetyman arrived,
followed almost immediately by young Nicholas. On seeing his son,
Nicholas rose.</p>

<p>"Well, I must be going," he said, "Nick here will tell you
what'll win the race." And with this hit at his eldest, who, as a
pillar of accountancy, and director of an insurance company, was no
more addicted to sport than his father had ever been, he departed.
Dear Nicholas! What race was that? Or was it only one of his jokes?
He was a wonderful man for his age! How many lumps would dear
Marian take? And how were Giles and Jesse? Aunt Juley supposed
their Yeomanry would be very busy now, guarding the coast, though
of course the Boers had no ships. But one never knew what the
French might do if they had the chance, especially since that
dreadful Fashoda scare, which had upset Timothy so terribly that he
had made no investments for months afterwards. It was the
ingratitude of the Boers that was so dreadful, after everything had
been done for them&mdash;Dr. Jameson imprisoned, and he was so
nice, Mrs. MacAnder had always said. And Sir Alfred Milner sent out
to talk to them&mdash;such a clever man! She didn't know what they
wanted.</p>

<p>But at this moment occurred one of those sensations&mdash;so
precious at Timothy's&mdash;which great occasions sometimes bring
forth:</p>

<p>"Miss June Forsyte."</p>

<p>Aunts Juley and Hester were on their feet at once, trembling
from smothered resentment, and old affection bubbling up, and pride
at the return of a prodigal June! Well, this was a surprise! Dear
June&mdash;after all these years! And how well she was looking! Not
changed at all! It was almost on their lips to add, 'And how is
your dear grandfather?' forgetting in that giddy moment that poor
dear Jolyon had been in his grave for seven years now.</p>

<p>Ever the most courageous and downright of all the Forsytes,
June, with her decided chin and her spirited eyes and her hair like
flame, sat down, slight and short, on a gilt chair with a
bead-worked seat, for all the world as if ten years had not elapsed
since she had been to see them&mdash;ten years of travel and
independence and devotion to lame ducks. Those ducks of late had
been all definitely painters, etchers, or sculptors, so that her
impatience with the Forsytes and their hopelessly inartistic
outlook had become intense. Indeed, she had almost ceased to
believe that her family existed, and looked round her now with a
sort of challenging directness which brought exquisite discomfort
to the roomful. She had not expected to meet any of them but 'the
poor old things'; and why she had come to see them she hardly knew,
except that, while on her way from Oxford Street to a studio in
Latimer Road, she had suddenly remembered them with compunction as
two long-neglected old lame ducks.</p>

<p>Aunt Juley broke the hush again. "We've just been saying, dear,
how dreadful it is about these Boers! And what an impudent thing of
that old Kruger!"</p>

<p>"Impudent!" said June. "I think he's quite right. What business
have we to meddle with them? If he turned out all those wretched
Uitlanders it would serve them right. They're only after
money."</p>

<p>The silence of sensation was broken by Francie saying:</p>

<p>"What? Are you a pro-Boer?" (undoubtedly the first use of that
expression).</p>

<p>"Well! Why can't we leave them alone?" said June, just as, in
the open doorway, the maid said "Mr. Soames Forsyte." Sensation on
sensation! Greeting was almost held up by curiosity to see how June
and he would take this encounter, for it was shrewdly suspected, if
not quite known, that they had not met since that old and
lamentable affair of her fiance Bosinney with Soames' wife. They
were seen to just touch each other's hands, and look each at the
other's left eye only. Aunt Juley came at once to the rescue:</p>

<p>"Dear June is so original. Fancy, Soames, she thinks the Boers
are not to blame."</p>

<p>"They only want their independence," said June; "and why
shouldn't they have it?"</p>

<p>"Because," answered Soames, with his smile a little on one side,
"they happen to have agreed to our suzerainty."</p>

<p>"Suzerainty!" repeated June scornfully; "we shouldn't like
anyone's suzerainty over us."</p>

<p>"They got advantages in payment," replied Soames; "a contract is
a contract."</p>

<p>"Contracts are not always just," fumed out June, "and when
they're not, they ought to be broken. The Boers are much the
weaker. We could afford to be generous."</p>

<p>Soames sniffed. "That's mere sentiment," he said.</p>

<p>Aunt Hester, to whom nothing was more awful than any kind of
disagreement, here leaned forward and remarked decisively:</p>

<p>"What lovely weather it has been for the time of year?"</p>

<p>But June was not to be diverted.</p>

<p>"I don't know why sentiment should be sneered at. It's the best
thing in the world." She looked defiantly round, and Aunt Juley had
to intervene again:</p>

<p>"Have you bought any pictures lately, Soames?"</p>

<p>Her incomparable instinct for the wrong subject had not failed
her. Soames flushed. To disclose the name of his latest purchases
would be like walking into the jaws of disdain. For somehow they
all knew of June's predilection for 'genius' not yet on its legs,
and her contempt for 'success' unless she had had a finger in
securing it.</p>

<p>"One or two," he muttered.</p>

<p>But June's face had changed; the Forsyte within her was seeing
its chance. Why should not Soames buy some of the pictures of Eric
Cobbley&mdash;her last lame duck? And she promptly opened her
attack: Did Soames know his work? It was so wonderful. He was the
coming man.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, Soames knew his work. It was in his view 'splashy,' and
would never get hold of the public.</p>

<p>June blazed up.</p>

<p>"Of course it won't; that's the last thing one would wish for. I
thought you were a connoisseur, not a picture-dealer."</p>

<p>"Of course Soames is a connoisseur," Aunt Juley said hastily;
"he has wonderful taste&mdash;he can always tell beforehand what's
going to be successful."</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped June, and sprang up from the bead-covered chair, "I
hate that standard of success. Why can't people buy things because
they like them?"</p>

<p>"You mean," said Francie, "because you like them."</p>

<p>And in the slight pause young Nicholas was heard saying gently
that Violet (his fourth) was taking lessons in pastel, he didn't
know if they were any use.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, Auntie," said June; "I must get on," and
kissing her aunts, she looked defiantly round the room, said
"Good-bye" again, and went. A breeze seemed to pass out with her,
as if everyone had sighed.</p>

<p>The third sensation came before anyone had time to speak:</p>

<p>"Mr. James Forsyte."</p>

<p>James came in using a stick slightly and wrapped in a fur coat
which gave him a fictitious bulk.</p>

<p>Everyone stood up. James was so old; and he had not been at
Timothy's for nearly two years.</p>

<p>"It's hot in here," he said.</p>

<p>Soames divested him of his coat, and as he did so could not help
admiring the glossy way his father was turned out. James sat down,
all knees, elbows, frock-coat, and long white whiskers.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of that?" he said.</p>

<p>Though there was no apparent sense in his words, they all knew
that he was referring to June. His eyes searched his son's
face.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd come and see for myself. What have they answered
Kruger?"</p>

<p>Soames took out an evening paper, and read the headline.</p>

<p>"'Instant action by our Government&mdash;state of war
existing!'"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said James, and sighed. "I was afraid they'd cut and run
like old Gladstone. We shall finish with them this time."</p>

<p>All stared at him. James! Always fussy, nervous, anxious! James
with his continual, 'I told you how it would be!' and his
pessimism, and his cautious investments. There was something
uncanny about such resolution in this the oldest living
Forsyte.</p>

<p>"Where's Timothy?" said James. "He ought to pay attention to
this."</p>

<p>Aunt Juley said she didn't know; Timothy had not said much at
lunch to-day. Aunt Hester rose and threaded her way out of the
room, and Francie said rather maliciously:</p>

<p>"The Boers are a hard nut to crack, Uncle James."</p>

<p>"H'm!" muttered James. "Where do you get your information?
Nobody tells me."</p>

<p>Young Nicholas remarked in his mild voice that Nick (his eldest)
was now going to drill regularly.</p>

<p>"Ah!" muttered James, and stared before him&mdash;his thoughts
were on Val. "He's got to look after his mother," he said, "he's
got no time for drilling and that, with that father of his." This
cryptic saying produced silence, until he spoke again.</p>

<p>"What did June want here?" And his eyes rested with suspicion on
all of them in turn. "Her father's a rich man now." The
conversation turned on Jolyon, and when he had been seen last. It
was supposed that he went abroad and saw all sorts of people now
that his wife was dead; his water-colours were on the line, and he
was a successful man. Francie went so far as to say:</p>

<p>"I should like to see him again; he was rather a dear."</p>

<p>Aunt Juley recalled how he had gone to sleep on the sofa one
day, where James was sitting. He had always been very amiable; what
did Soames think?</p>

<p>Knowing that Jolyon was Irene's trustee, all felt the delicacy
of this question, and looked at Soames with interest. A faint pink
had come up in his cheeks.</p>

<p>"He's going grey," he said.</p>

<p>Indeed! Had Soames seen him? Soames nodded, and the pink
vanished.</p>

<p>James said suddenly: "Well&mdash;I don't know, I can't
tell."</p>

<p>It so exactly expressed the sentiment of everybody present that
there was something behind everything, that nobody responded. But
at this moment Aunt Hester returned.</p>

<p>"Timothy," she said in a low voice, "Timothy has bought a map,
and he's put in&mdash;he's put in three flags."</p>

<p>Timothy had...! A sigh went round the company.</p>

<p>If Timothy had indeed put in three flags already, well!&mdash;it
showed what the nation could do when it was roused. The war was as
good as over.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;JOLYON FINDS OUT WHERE HE IS</h3>

<p>Jolyon stood at the window in Holly's old night nursery,
converted into a studio, not because it had a north light, but for
its view over the prospect away to the Grand Stand at Epsom. He
shifted to the side window which overlooked the stableyard, and
whistled down to the dog Balthasar who lay for ever under the clock
tower. The old dog looked up and wagged his tail. 'Poor old boy!'
thought Jolyon, shifting back to the other window.</p>

<p>He had been restless all this week, since his attempt to
prosecute trusteeship, uneasy in his conscience which was ever
acute, disturbed in his sense of compassion which was easily
excited, and with a queer sensation as if his feeling for beauty
had received some definite embodiment. Autumn was getting hold of
the old oak-tree, its leaves were browning. Sunshine had been
plentiful and hot this summer. As with trees, so with men's lives!
'I ought to live long,' thought Jolyon; 'I'm getting mildewed for
want of heat. If I can't work, I shall be off to Paris.' But memory
of Paris gave him no pleasure. Besides, how could he go? He must
stay and see what Soames was going to do. 'I'm her trustee. I can't
leave her unprotected,' he thought. It had been striking him as
curious how very clearly he could still see Irene in her little
drawing-room which he had only twice entered. Her beauty must have
a sort of poignant harmony! No literal portrait would ever do her
justice; the essence of her was&mdash;ah I what?...The noise of
hoofs called him back to the other window. Holly was riding into
the yard on her long-tailed 'palfrey.' She looked up and he waved
to her. She had been rather silent lately; getting old, he
supposed, beginning to want her future, as they all
did&mdash;youngsters!</p>

<p>Time was certainly the devil! And with the feeling that to waste
this swift-travelling commodity was unforgivable folly, he took up
his brush. But it was no use; he could not concentrate his
eye&mdash;besides, the light was going. 'I'll go up to town,' he
thought. In the hall a servant met him.</p>

<p>"A lady to see you, sir; Mrs. Heron."</p>

<p>Extraordinary coincidence! Passing into the picture-gallery, as
it was still called, he saw Irene standing over by the window.</p>

<p>She came towards him saying:</p>

<p>"I've been trespassing; I came up through the coppice and
garden. I always used to come that way to see Uncle Jolyon."</p>

<p>"You couldn't trespass here," replied Jolyon; "history makes
that impossible. I was just thinking of you."</p>

<p>Irene smiled. And it was as if something shone through; not mere
spirituality&mdash;serener, completer, more alluring.</p>

<p>"History!" she answered; "I once told Uncle Jolyon that love was
for ever. Well, it isn't. Only aversion lasts."</p>

<p>Jolyon stared at her. Had she got over Bosinney at last?</p>

<p>"Yes!" he said, "aversion's deeper than love or hate because
it's a natural product of the nerves, and we don't change
them."</p>

<p>"I came to tell you that Soames has been to see me. He said a
thing that frightened me. He said: 'You are still my wife!'"</p>

<p>"What!" ejaculated Jolyon. "You ought not to live alone." And he
continued to stare at her, afflicted by the thought that where
Beauty was, nothing ever ran quite straight, which, no doubt, was
why so many people looked on it as immoral.</p>

<p>"What more?"</p>

<p>"He asked me to shake hands.</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. When he came in I'm sure he didn't want to; he changed
while he was there."</p>

<p>"Ah! you certainly ought not to go on living there alone."</p>

<p>"I know no woman I could ask; and I can't take a lover to order,
Cousin Jolyon."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" said Jolyon. "What a damnable position! Will
you stay to dinner? No? Well, let me see you back to town; I wanted
to go up this evening."</p>

<p>"Truly?"</p>

<p>"Truly. I'll be ready in five minutes."</p>

<p>On that walk to the station they talked of pictures and music,
contrasting the English and French characters and the difference in
their attitude to Art. But to Jolyon the colours in the hedges of
the long straight lane, the twittering of chaffinches who kept pace
with them, the perfume of weeds being already burned, the turn of
her neck, the fascination of those dark eyes bent on him now and
then, the lure of her whole figure, made a deeper impression than
the remarks they exchanged. Unconsciously he held himself
straighter, walked with a more elastic step.</p>

<p>In the train he put her through a sort of catechism as to what
she did with her days.</p>

<p>Made her dresses, shopped, visited a hospital, played her piano,
translated from the French.</p>

<p>She had regular work from a publisher, it seemed, which
supplemented her income a little. She seldom went out in the
evening. "I've been living alone so long, you see, that I don't
mind it a bit. I believe I'm naturally solitary."</p>

<p>"I don't believe that," said Jolyon. "Do you know many
people?"</p>

<p>"Very few."</p>

<p>At Waterloo they took a hansom, and he drove with her to the
door of her mansions. Squeezing her hand at parting, he said:</p>

<p>"You know, you could always come to us at Robin Hill; you must
let me know everything that happens. Good-bye, Irene."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she answered softly.</p>

<p>Jolyon climbed back into his cab, wondering why he had not asked
her to dine and go to the theatre with him. Solitary, starved,
hung-up life that she had! "Hotch Potch Club," he said through the
trap-door. As his hansom debouched on to the Embankment, a man in
top-hat and overcoat passed, walking quickly, so close to the wall
that he seemed to be scraping it.</p>

<p>'By Jove!' thought Jolyon; 'Soames himself! What's he up to
now?' And, stopping the cab round the corner, he got out and
retraced his steps to where he could see the entrance to the
mansions. Soames had halted in front of them, and was looking up at
the light in her windows. 'If he goes in,' thought Jolyon, 'what
shall I do? What have I the right to do?' What the fellow had said
was true. She was still his wife, absolutely without protection
from annoyance! 'Well, if he goes in,' he thought, 'I follow.' And
he began moving towards the mansions. Again Soames advanced; he was
in the very entrance now. But suddenly he stopped, spun round on
his heel, and came back towards the river. 'What now?' thought
Jolyon. 'In a dozen steps he'll recognise me.' And he turned tail.
His cousin's footsteps kept pace with his own. But he reached his
cab, and got in before Soames had turned the corner. "Go on!" he
said through the trap. Soames' figure ranged up alongside.</p>

<p>"Hansom!" he said. "Engaged? Hallo!"</p>

<p>"Hallo!" answered Jolyon. "You?"</p>

<p>The quick suspicion on his cousin's face, white in the
lamplight, decided him.</p>

<p>"I can give you a lift," he said, "if you're going West."</p>

<p>"Thanks," answered Soames, and got in.</p>

<p>"I've been seeing Irene," said Jolyon when the cab had
started.</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"You went to see her yesterday yourself, I understand."</p>

<p>"I did," said Soames; "she's my wife, you know."</p>

<p>The tone, the half-lifted sneering lip, roused sudden anger in
Jolyon; but he subdued it.</p>

<p>"You ought to know best," he said, "but if you want a divorce
it's not very wise to go seeing her, is it? One can't run with the
hare and hunt with the hounds?"</p>

<p>"You're very good to warn me," said Soames, "but I have not made
up my mind."</p>

<p>"She has," said Jolyon, looking straight before him; "you can't
take things up, you know, as they were twelve years ago."</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen."</p>

<p>"Look here!" said Jolyon, "she's in a damnable position, and I
am the only person with any legal say in her affairs."</p>

<p>"Except myself," retorted Soames, "who am also in a damnable
position. Hers is what she made for herself; mine what she made for
me. I am not at all sure that in her own interests I shan't require
her to return to me."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Jolyon; and a shiver went through his whole
body.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you may mean by 'what,'" answered Soames
coldly; "your say in her affairs is confined to paying out her
income; please bear that in mind. In choosing not to disgrace her
by a divorce, I retained my rights, and, as I say, I am not at all
sure that I shan't require to exercise them."</p>

<p>"My God!" ejaculated Jolyon, and he uttered a short laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Soames, and there was a deadly quality in his voice.
"I've not forgotten the nickname your father gave me, 'The man of
property'! I'm not called names for nothing."</p>

<p>"This is fantastic," murmured Jolyon. Well, the fellow couldn't
force his wife to live with him. Those days were past, anyway! And
he looked around at Soames with the thought: 'Is he real, this
man?' But Soames looked very real, sitting square yet almost
elegant with the clipped moustache on his pale face, and a tooth
showing where a lip was lifted in a fixed smile. There was a long
silence, while Jolyon thought: 'Instead of helping her, I've made
things worse.' Suddenly Soames said:</p>

<p>"It would be the best thing that could happen to her in many
ways."</p>

<p>At those words such a turmoil began taking place in Jolyon that
he could barely sit still in the cab. It was as if he were boxed up
with hundreds of thousands of his countrymen, boxed up with that
something in the national character which had always been to him
revolting, something which he knew to be extremely natural and yet
which seemed to him inexplicable&mdash;their intense belief in
contracts and vested rights, their complacent sense of virtue in
the exaction of those rights. Here beside him in the cab was the
very embodiment, the corporeal sum as it were, of the possessive
instinct&mdash;his own kinsman, too! It was uncanny and
intolerable! 'But there's something more in it than that!' he
thought with a sick feeling. 'The dog, they say, returns to his
vomit! The sight of her has reawakened something. Beauty! The
devil's in it!'</p>

<p>"As I say," said Soames, "I have not made up my mind. I shall be
obliged if you will kindly leave her quite alone."</p>

<p>Jolyon bit his lips; he who had always hated rows almost
welcomed the thought of one now.</p>

<p>"I can give you no such promise," he said shortly.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Soames, "then we know where we are. I'll get
down here." And stopping the cab he got out without word or sign of
farewell. Jolyon travelled on to his Club.</p>

<p>The first news of the war was being called in the streets, but
he paid no attention. What could he do to help her? If only his
father were alive! He could have done so much! But why could he not
do all that his father could have done? Was he not old
enough?&mdash;turned fifty and twice married, with grown-up
daughters and a son. 'Queer,' he thought. 'If she were plain I
shouldn't be thinking twice about it. Beauty is the devil, when
you're sensitive to it!' And into the Club reading-room he went
with a disturbed heart. In that very room he and Bosinney had
talked one summer afternoon; he well remembered even now the
disguised and secret lecture he had given that young man in the
interests of June, the diagnosis of the Forsytes he had hazarded;
and how he had wondered what sort of woman it was he was warning
him against. And now! He was almost in want of a warning himself.
'It's deuced funny!' he thought, 'really deuced funny!'</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;SOAMES DISCOVERS WHAT HE WANTS</h3>

<p>It is so much easier to say, "Then we know where we are," than
to mean anything particular by the words. And in saying them Soames
did but vent the jealous rankling of his instincts. He got out of
the cab in a state of wary anger&mdash;with himself for not having
seen Irene, with Jolyon for having seen her; and now with his
inability to tell exactly what he wanted.</p>

<p>He had abandoned the cab because he could not bear to remain
seated beside his cousin, and walking briskly eastwards he thought:
'I wouldn't trust that fellow Jolyon a yard. Once outcast, always
outcast!' The chap had a natural sympathy
with&mdash;with&mdash;laxity (he had shied at the word sin, because
it was too melodramatic for use by a Forsyte).</p>

<p>Indecision in desire was to him a new feeling. He was like a
child between a promised toy and an old one which had been taken
away from him; and he was astonished at himself. Only last Sunday
desire had seemed simple&mdash;just his freedom and Annette. 'I'll
go and dine there,' he thought. To see her might bring back his
singleness of intention, calm his exasperation, clear his mind.</p>

<p>The restaurant was fairly full&mdash;a good many foreigners and
folk whom, from their appearance, he took to be literary or
artistic. Scraps of conversation came his way through the clatter
of plates and glasses. He distinctly heard the Boers sympathised
with, the British Government blamed. 'Don't think much of their
clientele,' he thought. He went stolidly through his dinner and
special coffee without making his presence known, and when at last
he had finished, was careful not to be seen going towards the
sanctum of Madame Lamotte. They were, as he entered, having
supper&mdash;such a much nicer-looking supper than the dinner he
had eaten that he felt a kind of grief&mdash;and they greeted him
with a surprise so seemingly genuine that he thought with sudden
suspicion: 'I believe they knew I was here all the time.' He gave
Annette a look furtive and searching. So pretty, seemingly so
candid; could she be angling for him? He turned to Madame Lamotte
and said:</p>

<p>"I've been dining here."</p>

<p>Really! If she had only known! There were dishes she could have
recommended; what a pity! Soames was confirmed in his suspicion. 'I
must look out what I'm doing!' he thought sharply.</p>

<p>"Another little cup of very special coffee, monsieur; a liqueur,
Grand Marnier?" and Madame Lamotte rose to order these
delicacies.</p>

<p>Alone with Annette Soames said, "Well, Annette?" with a
defensive little smile about his lips.</p>

<p>The girl blushed. This, which last Sunday would have set his
nerves tingling, now gave him much the same feeling a man has when
a dog that he owns wriggles and looks at him. He had a curious
sense of power, as if he could have said to her, 'Come and kiss
me,' and she would have come. And yet&mdash;it was
strange&mdash;but there seemed another face and form in the room
too; and the itch in his nerves, was it for that&mdash;or for this?
He jerked his head towards the restaurant and said: "You have some
queer customers. Do you like this life?"</p>

<p>Annette looked up at him for a moment, looked down, and played
with her fork.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I do not like it."</p>

<p>'I've got her,' thought Soames, 'if I want her. But do I want
her?' She was graceful, she was pretty&mdash;very pretty; she was
fresh, she had taste of a kind. His eyes travelled round the little
room; but the eyes of his mind went another journey&mdash;a
half-light, and silvery walls, a satinwood piano, a woman standing
against it, reined back as it were from him&mdash;a woman with
white shoulders that he knew, and dark eyes that he had sought to
know, and hair like dull dark amber. And as in an artist who
strives for the unrealisable and is ever thirsty, so there rose in
him at that moment the thirst of the old passion he had never
satisfied.</p>

<p>"Well," he said calmly, "you're young. There's everything before
you."</p>

<p>Annette shook her head.</p>

<p>"I think sometimes there is nothing before me but hard work. I
am not so in love with work as mother."</p>

<p>"Your mother is a wonder," said Soames, faintly mocking; "she
will never let failure lodge in her house."</p>

<p>Annette sighed. "It must be wonderful to be rich."</p>

<p>"Oh! You'll be rich some day," answered Soames, still with that
faint mockery; "don't be afraid."</p>

<p>Annette shrugged her shoulders. "Monsieur is very kind." And
between her pouting lips she put a chocolate.</p>

<p>'Yes, my dear,' thought Soames, 'they're very pretty.'</p>

<p>Madame Lamotte, with coffee and liqueur, put an end to that
colloquy. Soames did not stay long.</p>

<p>Outside in the streets of Soho, which always gave him such a
feeling of property improperly owned, he mused. If only Irene had
given him a son, he wouldn't now be squirming after women! The
thought had jumped out of its little dark sentry-box in his inner
consciousness. A son&mdash;something to look forward to, something
to make the rest of life worth while, something to leave himself
to, some perpetuity of self. 'If I had a son,' he thought bitterly,
'a proper legal son, I could make shift to go on as I used. One
woman's much the same as another, after all.' But as he walked he
shook his head. No! One woman was not the same as another. Many a
time had he tried to think that in the old days of his thwarted
married life; and he had always failed. He was failing now. He was
trying to think Annette the same as that other. But she was not,
she had not the lure of that old passion. 'And Irene's my wife,' he
thought, 'my legal wife. I have done nothing to put her away from
me. Why shouldn't she come back to me? It's the right thing, the
lawful thing. It makes no scandal, no disturbance. If it's
disagreeable to her&mdash;but why should it be? I'm not a leper,
and she&mdash;she's no longer in love!' Why should he be put to the
shifts and the sordid disgraces and the lurking defeats of the
Divorce Court, when there she was like an empty house only waiting
to be retaken into use and possession by him who legally owned her?
To one so secretive as Soames the thought of reentry into quiet
possession of his own property with nothing given away to the world
was intensely alluring. 'No,' he mused, 'I'm glad I went to see
that girl. I know now what I want most. If only Irene will come
back I'll be as considerate as she wishes; she could live her own
life; but perhaps&mdash;perhaps she would come round to me.' There
was a lump in his throat. And doggedly along by the railings of the
Green Park, towards his father's house, he went, trying to tread on
his shadow walking before him in the brilliant moonlight.</p>

<h2>PART II</h2>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE THIRD GENERATION</h3>

<p>Jolly Forsyte was strolling down High Street, Oxford, on a
November afternoon; Val Dartie was strolling up. Jolly had just
changed out of boating flannels and was on his way to the
'Frying-pan,' to which he had recently been elected. Val had just
changed out of riding clothes and was on his way to the
fire&mdash;a bookmaker's in Cornmarket.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said Jolly.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" replied Val.</p>

<p>The cousins had met but twice, Jolly, the second-year man,
having invited the freshman to breakfast; and last evening they had
seen each other again under somewhat exotic circumstances.</p>

<p>Over a tailor's in the Cornmarket resided one of those
privileged young beings called minors, whose inheritances are
large, whose parents are dead, whose guardians are remote, and
whose instincts are vicious. At nineteen he had commenced one of
those careers attractive and inexplicable to ordinary mortals for
whom a single bankruptcy is good as a feast. Already famous for
having the only roulette table then to be found in Oxford, he was
anticipating his expectations at a dazzling rate. He out-crummed
Crum, though of a sanguine and rather beefy type which lacked the
latter's fascinating languor. For Val it had been in the nature of
baptism to be taken there to play roulette; in the nature of
confirmation to get back into college, after hours, through a
window whose bars were deceptive. Once, during that evening of
delight, glancing up from the seductive green before him, he had
caught sight, through a cloud of smoke, of his cousin standing
opposite. 'Rouge gagne, impair, et manque!' He had not seen him
again.</p>

<p>"Come in to the Frying-pan and have tea," said Jolly, and they
went in.</p>

<p>A stranger, seeing them together, would have noticed an
unseizable resemblance between these second cousins of the third
generations of Forsytes; the same bone formation in face, though
Jolly's eyes were darker grey, his hair lighter and more wavy.</p>

<p>"Tea and buttered buns, waiter, please," said Jolly.</p>

<p>"Have one of my cigarettes?" said Val. "I saw you last night.
How did you do?"</p>

<p>"I didn't play."</p>

<p>"I won fifteen quid."</p>

<p>Though desirous of repeating a whimsical comment on gambling he
had once heard his father make&mdash;'When you're fleeced you're
sick, and when you fleece you're sorry&mdash;Jolly contented
himself with:</p>

<p>"Rotten game, I think; I was at school with that chap. He's an
awful fool."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know," said Val, as one might speak in defence of a
disparaged god; "he's a pretty good sport."</p>

<p>They exchanged whiffs in silence.</p>

<p>"You met my people, didn't you?" said Jolly. "They're coming up
to-morrow."</p>

<p>Val grew a little red.</p>

<p>"Really! I can give you a rare good tip for the Manchester
November handicap."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I only take interest in the classic races."</p>

<p>"You can't make any money over them," said Val.</p>

<p>"I hate the ring," said Jolly; "there's such a row and stink. I
like the paddock."</p>

<p>"I like to back my judgment,"' answered Val.</p>

<p>Jolly smiled; his smile was like his father's.</p>

<p>"I haven't got any. I always lose money if I bet."</p>

<p>"You have to buy experience, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's all messed-up with doing people in the eye."</p>

<p>"Of course, or they'll do you&mdash;that's the excitement."</p>

<p>Jolly looked a little scornful.</p>

<p>"What do you do with yourself? Row?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;ride, and drive about. I'm going to play polo next
term, if I can get my granddad to stump up."</p>

<p>"That's old Uncle James, isn't it? What's he like?"</p>

<p>"Older than forty hills," said Val, "and always thinking he's
going to be ruined."</p>

<p>"I suppose my granddad and he were brothers."</p>

<p>"I don't believe any of that old lot were sportsmen," said Val;
"they must have worshipped money."</p>

<p>"Mine didn't!" said Jolly warmly.</p>

<p>Val flipped the ash off his cigarette.</p>

<p>"Money's only fit to spend," he said; "I wish the deuce I had
more."</p>

<p>Jolly gave him that direct upward look of judgment which he had
inherited from old Jolyon: One didn't talk about money! And again
there was silence, while they drank tea and ate the buttered
buns.</p>

<p>"Where are your people going to stay?" asked Val, elaborately
casual.</p>

<p>"'Rainbow.' What do you think of the war?"</p>

<p>"Rotten, so far. The Boers aren't sports a bit. Why don't they
come out into the open?"</p>

<p>"Why should they? They've got everything against them except
their way of fighting. I rather admire them."</p>

<p>"They can ride and shoot," admitted Val, "but they're a lousy
lot. Do you know Crum?"</p>

<p>"Of Merton? Only by sight. He's in that fast set too, isn't he?
Rather La-di-da and Brummagem."</p>

<p>Val said fixedly: "He's a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Oh! Sorry!" And they sat awkwardly staring past each other,
having pitched on their pet points of snobbery. For Jolly was
forming himself unconsciously on a set whose motto was:</p>

<p>'We defy you to bore us. Life isn't half long enough, and we're
going to talk faster and more crisply, do more and know more, and
dwell less on any subject than you can possibly imagine. We are
"the best"&mdash;made of wire and whipcord.' And Val was
unconsciously forming himself on a set whose motto was: 'We defy
you to interest or excite us. We have had every sensation, or if we
haven't, we pretend we have. We are so exhausted with living that
no hours are too small for us. We will lose our shirts with
equanimity. We have flown fast and are past everything. All is
cigarette smoke. Bismillah!' Competitive spirit, bone-deep in the
English, was obliging those two young Forsytes to have ideals; and
at the close of a century ideals are mixed. The aristocracy had
already in the main adopted the 'jumping-Jesus' principle; though
here and there one like Crum&mdash;who was an
'honourable'&mdash;stood starkly languid for that gambler's Nirvana
which had been the summum bonum of the old 'dandies' and of 'the
mashers' in the eighties. And round Crum were still gathered a
forlorn hope of blue-bloods with a plutocratic following.</p>

<p>But there was between the cousins another far less obvious
antipathy&mdash;coming from the unseizable family resemblance,
which each perhaps resented; or from some half-consciousness of
that old feud persisting still between their branches of the clan,
formed within them by odd words or half-hints dropped by their
elders. And Jolly, tinkling his teaspoon, was musing: 'His tie-pin
and his waistcoat and his drawl and his betting&mdash;good
Lord!'</p>

<p>And Val, finishing his bun, was thinking: 'He's rather a young
beast!'</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll be meeting your people?" he said, getting up.
"I wish you'd tell them I should like to show them over
B.N.C.&mdash;not that there's anything much there&mdash;if they'd
care to come."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I'll ask them."</p>

<p>"Would they lunch? I've got rather a decent scout."</p>

<p>Jolly doubted if they would have time.</p>

<p>"You'll ask them, though?"</p>

<p>"Very good of you," said Jolly, fully meaning that they should
not go; but, instinctively polite, he added: "You'd better come and
have dinner with us to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Rather. What time?"</p>

<p>"Seven-thirty."</p>

<p>"Dress?"</p>

<p>"No." And they parted, a subtle antagonism alive within
them.</p>

<p>Holly and her father arrived by a midday train. It was her first
visit to the city of spires and dreams, and she was very silent,
looking almost shyly at the brother who was part of this wonderful
place. After lunch she wandered, examining his household gods with
intense curiosity. Jolly's sitting-room was panelled, and Art
represented by a set of Bartolozzi prints which had belonged to old
Jolyon, and by college photographs&mdash;of young men, live young
men, a little heroic, and to be compared with her memories of Val.
Jolyon also scrutinised with care that evidence of his boy's
character and tastes.</p>

<p>Jolly was anxious that they should see him rowing, so they set
forth to the river. Holly, between her brother and her father, felt
elated when heads were turned and eyes rested on her. That they
might see him to the best advantage they left him at the Barge and
crossed the river to the towing-path. Slight in build&mdash;for of
all the Forsytes only old Swithin and George were beefy&mdash;Jolly
was rowing 'Two' in a trial eight. He looked very earnest and
strenuous. With pride Jolyon thought him the best-looking boy of
the lot; Holly, as became a sister, was more struck by one or two
of the others, but would not have said so for the world. The river
was bright that afternoon, the meadows lush, the trees still
beautiful with colour. Distinguished peace clung around the old
city; Jolyon promised himself a day's sketching if the weather
held. The Eight passed a second time, spurting home along the
Barges&mdash;Jolly's face was very set, so as not to show that he
was blown. They returned across the river and waited for him.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Jolly in the Christ Church meadows, "I had to ask
that chap Val Dartie to dine with us to-night. He wanted to give
you lunch and show you B.N.C., so I thought I'd better; then you
needn't go. I don't like him much."</p>

<p>Holly's rather sallow face had become suffused with pink.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know. He seems to me rather showy and bad form.
What are his people like, Dad? He's only a second cousin, isn't
he?"</p>

<p>Jolyon took refuge in a smile.</p>

<p>"Ask Holly," he said; "she saw his uncle."</p>

<p>"I liked Val," Holly answered, staring at the ground before her;
"his uncle looked&mdash;awfully different." She stole a glance at
Jolly from under her lashes.</p>

<p>"Did you ever," said Jolyon with whimsical intention, "hear our
family history, my dears? It's quite a fairy tale. The first Jolyon
Forsyte&mdash;at all events the first we know anything of, and that
would be your great-great-grandfather&mdash;dwelt in the land of
Dorset on the edge of the sea, being by profession an
'agriculturalist,' as your great-aunt put it, and the son of an
agriculturist&mdash;farmers, in fact; your grandfather used to call
them, 'Very small beer.'" He looked at Jolly to see how his
lordliness was standing it, and with the other eye noted Holly's
malicious pleasure in the slight drop of her brother's face.</p>

<p>"We may suppose him thick and sturdy, standing for England as it
was before the Industrial Era began. The second Jolyon
Forsyte&mdash;your great-grandfather, Jolly; better known as
Superior Dosset Forsyte&mdash;built houses, so the chronicle runs,
begat ten children, and migrated to London town. It is known that
he drank sherry. We may suppose him representing the England of
Napoleon's wars, and general unrest. The eldest of his six sons was
the third Jolyon, your grandfather, my dears&mdash;tea merchant and
chairman of companies, one of the soundest Englishmen who ever
lived&mdash;and to me the dearest." Jolyon's voice had lost its
irony, and his son and daughter gazed at him solemnly, "He was just
and tenacious, tender and young at heart. You remember him, and I
remember him. Pass to the others! Your great-uncle James, that's
young Val's grandfather, had a son called Soames&mdash;whereby
hangs a tale of no love lost, and I don't think I'll tell it you.
James and the other eight children of 'Superior Dosset,' of whom
there are still five alive, may be said to have represented
Victorian England, with its principles of trade and individualism
at five per cent. and your money back&mdash;if you know what that
means. At all events they've turned thirty thousand pounds into a
cool million between them in the course of their long lives. They
never did a wild thing&mdash;unless it was your great-uncle
Swithin, who I believe was once swindled at thimble-rig, and was
called 'Four-in-hand Forsyte' because he drove a pair. Their day is
passing, and their type, not altogether for the advantage of the
country. They were pedestrian, but they too were sound. I am the
fourth Jolyon Forsyte&mdash;a poor holder of the name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Dad," said Jolly, and Holly squeezed his hand.</p>

<p>"Yes," repeated Jolyon, "a poor specimen, representing, I'm
afraid, nothing but the end of the century, unearned income,
amateurism, and individual liberty&mdash;a different thing from
individualism, Jolly. You are the fifth Jolyon Forsyte, old man,
and you open the ball of the new century."</p>

<p>As he spoke they turned in through the college gates, and Holly
said: "It's fascinating, Dad."</p>

<p>None of them quite knew what she meant. Jolly was grave.</p>

<p>The Rainbow, distinguished, as only an Oxford hostel can be, for
lack of modernity, provided one small oak-panelled private
sitting-room, in which Holly sat to receive, white-frocked, shy,
and alone, when the only guest arrived. Rather as one would touch a
moth, Val took her hand. And wouldn't she wear this 'measly
flower'? It would look ripping in her hair. He removed a gardenia
from his coat.</p>

<p>"Oh! No, thank you&mdash;I couldn't!" But she took it and pinned
it at her neck, having suddenly remembered that word 'showy'! Val's
buttonhole would give offence; and she so much wanted Jolly to like
him. Did she realise that Val was at his best and quietest in her
presence, and was that, perhaps, half the secret of his attraction
for her?</p>

<p>"I never said anything about our ride, Val."</p>

<p>"Rather not! It's just between us."</p>

<p>By the uneasiness of his hands and the fidgeting of his feet he
was giving her a sense of power very delicious; a soft feeling
too&mdash;the wish to make him happy.</p>

<p>"Do tell me about Oxford. It must be ever so lovely."</p>

<p>Val admitted that it was frightfully decent to do what you
liked; the lectures were nothing; and there were some very good
chaps. "Only," he added, "of course I wish I was in town, and could
come down and see you."</p>

<p>Holly moved one hand shyly on her knee, and her glance
dropped.</p>

<p>"You haven't forgotten," he said, suddenly gathering courage,
"that we're going mad-rabbiting together?"</p>

<p>Holly smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh! That was only make-believe. One can't do that sort of thing
after one's grown up, you know."</p>

<p>"Dash it! cousins can," said Val. "Next Long Vac.&mdash;it
begins in June, you know, and goes on for ever&mdash;we'll watch
our chance."</p>

<p>But, though the thrill of conspiracy ran through her veins,
Holly shook her head. "It won't come off," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Won't it!" said Val fervently; "who's going to stop it? Not
your father or your brother."</p>

<p>At this moment Jolyon and Jolly came in; and romance fled into
Val's patent leather and Holly's white satin toes, where it itched
and tingled during an evening not conspicuous for
open-heartedness.</p>

<p>Sensitive to atmosphere, Jolyon soon felt the latent antagonism
between the boys, and was puzzled by Holly; so he became
unconsciously ironical, which is fatal to the expansiveness of
youth. A letter, handed to him after dinner, reduced him to a
silence hardly broken till Jolly and Val rose to go. He went out
with them, smoking his cigar, and walked with his son to the gates
of Christ Church. Turning back, he took out the letter and read it
again beneath a lamp.</p>

<blockquote>"DEAR JOLYON,<br>
<br>
"Soames came again to-night&mdash;my thirty-seventh birthday. You
were right, I mustn't stay here. I'm going to-morrow to the
Piedmont Hotel, but I won't go abroad without seeing you. I feel
lonely and down-hearted.<br>
<br>
"Yours affectionately,<br>
"IRENE."</blockquote>

<p>He folded the letter back into his pocket and walked on,
astonished at the violence of his feelings. What had the fellow
said or done?</p>

<p>He turned into High Street, down the Turf, and on among a maze
of spires and domes and long college fronts and walls, bright or
dark-shadowed in the strong moonlight. In this very heart of
England's gentility it was difficult to realise that a lonely woman
could be importuned or hunted, but what else could her letter mean?
Soames must have been pressing her to go back to him again, with
public opinion and the Law on his side, too!
'Eighteen-ninety-nine!,' he thought, gazing at the broken glass
shining on the top of a villa garden wall; 'but when it comes to
property we're still a heathen people! I'll go up to-morrow
morning. I dare say it'll be best for her to go abroad.' Yet the
thought displeased him. Why should Soames hunt her out of England!
Besides, he might follow, and out there she would be still more
helpless against the attentions of her own husband! 'I must tread
warily,' he thought; 'that fellow could make himself very nasty. I
didn't like his manner in the cab the other night.' His thoughts
turned to his daughter June. Could she help? Once on a time Irene
had been her greatest friend, and now she was a 'lame duck,' such
as must appeal to June's nature! He determined to wire to his
daughter to meet him at Paddington Station. Retracing his steps
towards the Rainbow he questioned his own sensations. Would he be
upsetting himself over every woman in like case? No! he would not.
The candour of this conclusion discomfited him; and, finding that
Holly had gone up to bed, he sought his own room. But he could not
sleep, and sat for a long time at his window, huddled in an
overcoat, watching the moonlight on the roofs.</p>

<p>Next door Holly too was awake, thinking of the lashes above and
below Val's eyes, especially below; and of what she could do to
make Jolly like him better. The scent of the gardenia was strong in
her little bedroom, and pleasant to her.</p>

<p>And Val, leaning out of his first-floor window in B.N.C., was
gazing at a moonlit quadrangle without seeing it at all, seeing
instead Holly, slim and white-frocked, as she sat beside the fire
when he first went in.</p>

<p>But Jolly, in his bedroom narrow as a ghost, lay with a hand
beneath his cheek and dreamed he was with Val in one boat, rowing a
race against him, while his father was calling from the towpath:
'Two! Get your hands away there, bless you!'</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER II&mdash;SOAMES PUTS IT TO THE TOUCH</h3>

<p>Of all those radiant firms which emblazon with their windows the
West End of London, Gaves and Cortegal were considered by Soames
the most 'attractive' word just coming into fashion. He had never
had his Uncle Swithin's taste in precious stones, and the
abandonment by Irene when she left his house in 1887 of all the
glittering things he had given her had disgusted him with this form
of investment. But he still knew a diamond when he saw one, and
during the week before her birthday he had taken occasion, on his
way into the Poultry or his way out therefrom, to dally a little
before the greater jewellers where one got, if not one's money's
worth, at least a certain cachet with the goods.</p>

<p>Constant cogitation since his drive with Jolyon had convinced
him more and more of the supreme importance of this moment in his
life, the supreme need for taking steps and those not wrong. And,
alongside the dry and reasoned sense that it was now or never with
his self-preservation, now or never if he were to range himself and
found a family, went the secret urge of his senses roused by the
sight of her who had once been a passionately desired wife, and the
conviction that it was a sin against common sense and the decent
secrecy of Forsytes to waste the wife he had.</p>

<p>In an opinion on Winifred's case, Dreamer, Q.C.&mdash;he would
much have preferred Waterbuck, but they had made him a judge (so
late in the day as to rouse the usual suspicion of a political
job)&mdash;had advised that they should go forward and obtain
restitution of conjugal rights, a point which to Soames had never
been in doubt. When they had obtained a decree to that effect they
must wait to see if it was obeyed. If not, it would constitute
legal desertion, and they should obtain evidence of misconduct and
file their petition for divorce. All of which Soames knew perfectly
well. They had marked him ten and one. This simplicity in his
sister's case only made him the more desperate about the difficulty
in his own. Everything, in fact, was driving him towards the simple
solution of Irene's return. If it were still against the grain with
her, had he not feelings to subdue, injury to forgive, pain to
forget? He at least had never injured her, and this was a world of
compromise! He could offer her so much more than she had now. He
would be prepared to make a liberal settlement on her which could
not be upset. He often scrutinised his image in these days. He had
never been a peacock like that fellow Dartie, or fancied himself a
woman's man, but he had a certain belief in his own
appearance&mdash;not unjustly, for it was well-coupled and
preserved, neat, healthy, pale, unblemished by drink or excess of
any kind. The Forsyte jaw and the concentration of his face were,
in his eyes, virtues. So far as he could tell there was no feature
of him which need inspire dislike.</p>

<p>Thoughts and yearnings, with which one lives daily, become
natural, even if far-fetched in their inception. If he could only
give tangible proof enough of his determination to let bygones be
bygones, and to do all in his power to please her, why should she
not come back to him?</p>

<p>He entered Gaves and Cortegal's therefore, on the morning of
November the 9th, to buy a certain diamond brooch. "Four
twenty-five and dirt cheap, sir, at the money. It's a lady's
brooch." There was that in his mood which made him accept without
demur. And he went on into the Poultry with the flat green morocco
case in his breast pocket. Several times that day he opened it to
look at the seven soft shining stones in their velvet oval
nest.</p>

<p>"If the lady doesn't like it, sir, happy to exchange it any
time. But there's no fear of that." If only there were not! He got
through a vast amount of work, only soother of the nerves he knew.
A cablegram came while he was in the office with details from the
agent in Buenos Aires, and the name and address of a stewardess who
would be prepared to swear to what was necessary. It was a timely
spur to Soames, with his rooted distaste for the washing of dirty
linen in public. And when he set forth by Underground to Victoria
Station he received a fresh impetus towards the renewal of his
married life from the account in his evening paper of a fashionable
divorce suit. The homing instinct of all true Forsytes in anxiety
and trouble, the corporate tendency which kept them strong and
solid, made him choose to dine at Park Lane. He neither could nor
would breath a word to his people of his intention&mdash;too
reticent and proud&mdash;but the thought that at least they would
be glad if they knew, and wish him luck, was heartening.</p>

<p>James was in lugubrious mood, for the fire which the impudence
of Kruger's ultimatum had lit in him had been cold-watered by the
poor success of the last month, and the exhortations to effort in
The Times. He didn't know where it would end. Soames sought to
cheer him by the continual use of the word Buller. But James
couldn't tell! There was Colley&mdash;and he got stuck on that
hill, and this Ladysmith was down in a hollow, and altogether it
looked to him a 'pretty kettle of fish'; he thought they ought to
be sending the sailors&mdash;they were the chaps, they did a lot of
good in the Crimea. Soames shifted the ground of consolation.
Winifred had heard from Val that there had been a 'rag' and a
bonfire on Guy Fawkes Day at Oxford, and that he had escaped
detection by blacking his face.</p>

<p>"Ah!" James muttered, "he's a clever little chap." But he shook
his head shortly afterwards and remarked that he didn't know what
would become of him, and looking wistfully at his son, murmured on
that Soames had never had a boy. He would have liked a grandson of
his own name. And now&mdash;well, there it was!</p>

<p>Soames flinched. He had not expected such a challenge to
disclose the secret in his heart. And Emily, who saw him wince,
said:</p>

<p>"Nonsense, James; don't talk like that!"</p>

<p>But James, not looking anyone in the face, muttered on. There
were Roger and Nicholas and Jolyon; they all had grandsons. And
Swithin and Timothy had never married. He had done his best; but he
would soon be gone now. And, as though he had uttered words of
profound consolation, he was silent, eating brains with a fork and
a piece of bread, and swallowing the bread.</p>

<p>Soames excused himself directly after dinner. It was not really
cold, but he put on his fur coat, which served to fortify him
against the fits of nervous shivering to which he had been subject
all day. Subconsciously, he knew that he looked better thus than in
an ordinary black overcoat. Then, feeling the morocco case flat
against his heart, he sallied forth. He was no smoker, but he lit a
cigarette, and smoked it gingerly as he walked along. He moved
slowly down the Row towards Knightsbridge, timing himself to get to
Chelsea at nine-fifteen. What did she do with herself evening after
evening in that little hole? How mysterious women were! One lived
alongside and knew nothing of them. What could she have seen in
that fellow Bosinney to send her mad? For there was madness after
all in what she had done&mdash;crazy moonstruck madness, in which
all sense of values had been lost, and her life and his life
ruined! And for a moment he was filled with a sort of exaltation,
as though he were a man read of in a story who, possessed by the
Christian spirit, would restore to her all the prizes of existence,
forgiving and forgetting, and becoming the godfather of her future.
Under a tree opposite Knightsbridge Barracks, where the moon-light
struck down clear and white, he took out once more the morocco
case, and let the beams draw colour from those stones. Yes, they
were of the first water! But, at the hard closing snap of the case,
another cold shiver ran through his nerves; and he walked on
faster, clenching his gloved hands in the pockets of his coat,
almost hoping she would not be in. The thought of how mysterious
she was again beset him. Dining alone there night after
night&mdash;in an evening dress, too, as if she were making believe
to be in society! Playing the piano&mdash;to herself! Not even a
dog or cat, so far as he had seen. And that reminded him suddenly
of the mare he kept for station work at Mapledurham. If ever he
went to the stable, there she was quite alone, half asleep, and
yet, on her home journeys going more freely than on her way out, as
if longing to be back and lonely in her stable! 'I would treat her
well,' he thought incoherently. 'I would be very careful.' And all
that capacity for home life of which a mocking Fate seemed for ever
to have deprived him swelled suddenly in Soames, so that he dreamed
dreams opposite South Kensington Station. In the King's Road a man
came slithering out of a public house playing a concertina. Soames
watched him for a moment dance crazily on the pavement to his own
drawling jagged sounds, then crossed over to avoid contact with
this piece of drunken foolery. A night in the lock-up! What asses
people were! But the man had noticed his movement of avoidance, and
streams of genial blasphemy followed him across the street. 'I hope
they'll run him in,' thought Soames viciously. 'To have ruffians
like that about, with women out alone!' A woman's figure in front
had induced this thought. Her walk seemed oddly familiar, and when
she turned the corner for which he was bound, his heart began to
beat. He hastened on to the corner to make certain. Yes! It was
Irene; he could not mistake her walk in that little drab street.
She threaded two more turnings, and from the last corner he saw her
enter her block of flats. To make sure of her now, he ran those few
paces, hurried up the stairs, and caught her standing at her door.
He heard the latchkey in the lock, and reached her side just as she
turned round, startled, in the open doorway.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed," he said, breathless. "I happened to see you.
Let me come in a minute."</p>

<p>She had put her hand up to her breast, her face was colourless,
her eyes widened by alarm. Then seeming to master herself, she
inclined her head, and said: "Very well."</p>

<p>Soames closed the door. He, too, had need to recover, and when
she had passed into the sitting-room, waited a full minute, taking
deep breaths to still the beating of his heart. At this moment, so
fraught with the future, to take out that morocco case seemed
crude. Yet, not to take it out left him there before her with no
preliminary excuse for coming. And in this dilemma he was seized
with impatience at all this paraphernalia of excuse and
justification. This was a scene&mdash;it could be nothing else, and
he must face it. He heard her voice, uncomfortably, pathetically
soft:</p>

<p>"Why have you come again? Didn't you understand that I would
rather you did not?"</p>

<p>He noticed her clothes&mdash;a dark brown velvet corduroy, a
sable boa, a small round toque of the same. They suited her
admirably. She had money to spare for dress, evidently! He said
abruptly:</p>

<p>"It's your birthday. I brought you this," and he held out to her
the green morocco case.</p>

<p>"Oh! No-no!"</p>

<p>Soames pressed the clasp; the seven stones gleamed out on the
pale grey velvet.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he said. "Just as a sign that you don't bear me
ill-feeling any longer."</p>

<p>"I couldn't."</p>

<p>Soames took it out of the case.</p>

<p>"Let me just see how it looks."</p>

<p>She shrank back.</p>

<p>He followed, thrusting his hand with the brooch in it against
the front of her dress. She shrank again.</p>

<p>Soames dropped his hand.</p>

<p>"Irene," he said, "let bygones be bygones. If I can, surely you
might. Let's begin again, as if nothing had been. Won't you?" His
voice was wistful, and his eyes, resting on her face, had in them a
sort of supplication.</p>

<p>She, who was standing literally with her back against the wall,
gave a little gulp, and that was all her answer. Soames went
on:</p>

<p>"Can you really want to live all your days half-dead in this
little hole? Come back to me, and I'll give you all you want. You
shall live your own life; I swear it."</p>

<p>He saw her face quiver ironically.</p>

<p>"Yes," he repeated, "but I mean it this time. I'll only ask one
thing. I just want&mdash;I just want a son. Don't look like that! I
want one. It's hard." His voice had grown hurried, so that he
hardly knew it for his own, and twice he jerked his head back as if
struggling for breath. It was the sight of her eyes fixed on him,
dark with a sort of fascinated fright, which pulled him together
and changed that painful incoherence to anger.</p>

<p>"Is it so very unnatural?" he said between his teeth, "Is it
unnatural to want a child from one's own wife? You wrecked our life
and put this blight on everything. We go on only half alive, and
without any future. Is it so very unflattering to you that in spite
of everything I&mdash;I still want you for my wife? Speak, for
Goodness' sake! do speak."</p>

<p>Irene seemed to try, but did not succeed.</p>

<p>"I don't want to frighten you," said Soames more gently. "Heaven
knows. I only want you to see that I can't go on like this. I want
you back. I want you."</p>

<p>Irene raised one hand and covered the lower part of her face,
but her eyes never moved from his, as though she trusted in them to
keep him at bay. And all those years, barren and bitter,
since&mdash;ah! when?&mdash;almost since he had first known her,
surged up in one great wave of recollection in Soames; and a spasm
that for his life he could not control constricted his face.</p>

<p>"It's not too late," he said; "it's not&mdash;if you'll only
believe it."</p>

<p>Irene uncovered her lips, and both her hands made a writhing
gesture in front of her breast. Soames seized them.</p>

<p>"Don't!" she said under her breath. But he stood holding on to
them, trying to stare into her eyes which did not waver. Then she
said quietly:</p>

<p>"I am alone here. You won't behave again as you once
behaved."</p>

<p>Dropping her hands as though they had been hot irons, he turned
away. Was it possible that there could be such relentless
unforgiveness! Could that one act of violent possession be still
alive within her? Did it bar him thus utterly? And doggedly he
said, without looking up:</p>

<p>"I am not going till you've answered me. I am offering what few
men would bring themselves to offer, I want a&mdash;a reasonable
answer."</p>

<p>And almost with surprise he heard her say:</p>

<p>"You can't have a reasonable answer. Reason has nothing to do
with it. You can only have the brutal truth: I would rather
die."</p>

<p>Soames stared at her.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said. And there intervened in him a sort of paralysis
of speech and movement, the kind of quivering which comes when a
man has received a deadly insult, and does not yet know how he is
going to take it, or rather what it is going to do with him.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said again, "as bad as that? Indeed! You would rather
die. That's pretty!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry. You wanted me to answer. I can't help the truth,
can I?"</p>

<p>At that queer spiritual appeal Soames turned for relief to
actuality. He snapped the brooch back into its case and put it in
his pocket.</p>

<p>"The truth!" he said; "there's no such thing with women. It's
nerves-nerves."</p>

<p>He heard the whisper:</p>

<p>"Yes; nerves don't lie. Haven't you discovered that?" He was
silent, obsessed by the thought: 'I will hate this woman. I will
hate her.' That was the trouble! If only he could! He shot a glance
at her who stood unmoving against the wall with her head up and her
hands clasped, for all the world as if she were going to be shot.
And he said quickly:</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it. You have a lover. If you hadn't,
you wouldn't be such a&mdash;such a little idiot." He was
conscious, before the expression in her eyes, that he had uttered
something of a non-sequitur, and dropped back too abruptly into the
verbal freedom of his connubial days. He turned away to the door.
But he could not go out. Something within him&mdash;that most deep
and secret Forsyte quality, the impossibility of letting go, the
impossibility of seeing the fantastic and forlorn nature of his own
tenacity&mdash;prevented him. He turned about again, and there
stood, with his back against the door, as hers was against the wall
opposite, quite unconscious of anything ridiculous in this
separation by the whole width of the room.</p>

<p>"Do you ever think of anybody but yourself?" he said.</p>

<p>Irene's lips quivered; then she answered slowly:</p>

<p>"Do you ever think that I found out my mistake&mdash;my
hopeless, terrible mistake&mdash;the very first week of our
marriage; that I went on trying three years&mdash;you know I went
on trying? Was it for myself?"</p>

<p>Soames gritted his teeth. "God knows what it was. I've never
understood you; I shall never understand you. You had everything
you wanted; and you can have it again, and more. What's the matter
with me? I ask you a plain question: What is it?" Unconscious of
the pathos in that enquiry, he went on passionately: "I'm not lame,
I'm not loathsome, I'm not a boor, I'm not a fool. What is it?
What's the mystery about me?"</p>

<p>Her answer was a long sigh.</p>

<p>He clasped his hands with a gesture that for him was strangely
full of expression. "When I came here to-night I was&mdash;I
hoped&mdash;I meant everything that I could to do away with the
past, and start fair again. And you meet me with 'nerves,' and
silence, and sighs. There's nothing tangible. It's like&mdash;it's
like a spider's web."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>That whisper from across the room maddened Soames afresh.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't choose to be in a spider's web. I'll cut it." He
walked straight up to her. "Now!" What he had gone up to her to do
he really did not know. But when he was close, the old familiar
scent of her clothes suddenly affected him. He put his hands on her
shoulders and bent forward to kiss her. He kissed not her lips, but
a little hard line where the lips had been drawn in; then his face
was pressed away by her hands; he heard her say: "Oh! No!" Shame,
compunction, sense of futility flooded his whole being, he turned
on his heel and went straight out.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III&mdash;VISIT TO IRENE</h3>

<p>Jolyon found June waiting on the platform at Paddington. She had
received his telegram while at breakfast. Her abode&mdash;a studio
and two bedrooms in a St. John's Wood garden&mdash;had been
selected by her for the complete independence which it guaranteed.
Unwatched by Mrs. Grundy, unhindered by permanent domestics, she
could receive lame ducks at any hour of day or night, and not
seldom had a duck without studio of its own made use of June's. She
enjoyed her freedom, and possessed herself with a sort of virginal
passion; the warmth which she would have lavished on Bosinney, and
of which&mdash;given her Forsyte tenacity&mdash;he must surely have
tired, she now expended in championship of the underdogs and
budding 'geniuses' of the artistic world. She lived, in fact, to
turn ducks into the swans she believed they were. The very fervour
of her protection warped her judgments. But she was loyal and
liberal; her small eager hand was ever against the oppressions of
academic and commercial opinion, and though her income was
considerable, her bank balance was often a minus quantity.</p>

<p>She had come to Paddington Station heated in her soul by a visit
to Eric Cobbley. A miserable Gallery had refused to let that
straight-haired genius have his one-man show after all. Its
impudent manager, after visiting his studio, had expressed the
opinion that it would only be a 'one-horse show from the selling
point of view.' This crowning example of commercial cowardice
towards her favourite lame duck&mdash;and he so hard up, with a
wife and two children, that he had caused her account to be
overdrawn&mdash;was still making the blood glow in her small,
resolute face, and her red-gold hair to shine more than ever. She
gave her father a hug, and got into a cab with him, having as many
fish to fry with him as he with her. It became at once a question
which would fry them first.</p>

<p>Jolyon had reached the words: "My dear, I want you to come with
me," when, glancing at her face, he perceived by her blue eyes
moving from side to side&mdash;like the tail of a preoccupied
cat&mdash;that she was not attending. "Dad, is it true that I
absolutely can't get at any of my money?"</p>

<p>"Only the income, fortunately, my love."</p>

<p>"How perfectly beastly! Can't it be done somehow? There must be
a way. I know I could buy a small Gallery for ten thousand
pounds."</p>

<p>"A small Gallery," murmured Jolyon, "seems a modest desire. But
your grandfather foresaw it."</p>

<p>"I think," cried June vigorously, "that all this care about
money is awful, when there's so much genius in the world simply
crushed out for want of a little. I shall never marry and have
children; why shouldn't I be able to do some good instead of having
it all tied up in case of things which will never come off?"</p>

<p>"Our name is Forsyte, my dear," replied Jolyon in the ironical
voice to which his impetuous daughter had never quite grown
accustomed; "and Forsytes, you know, are people who so settle their
property that their grandchildren, in case they should die before
their parents, have to make wills leaving the property that will
only come to themselves when their parents die. Do you follow that?
Nor do I, but it's a fact, anyway; we live by the principle that so
long as there is a possibility of keeping wealth in the family it
must not go out; if you die unmarried, your money goes to Jolly and
Holly and their children if they marry. Isn't it pleasant to know
that whatever you do you can none of you be destitute?"</p>

<p>"But can't I borrow the money?"</p>

<p>Jolyon shook his head. "You could rent a Gallery, no doubt, if
you could manage it out of your income."</p>

<p>June uttered a contemptuous sound.</p>

<p>"Yes; and have no income left to help anybody with."</p>

<p>"My dear child," murmured Jolyon, "wouldn't it come to the same
thing?"</p>

<p>"No," said June shrewdly, "I could buy for ten thousand; that
would only be four hundred a year. But I should have to pay a
thousand a year rent, and that would only leave me five hundred. If
I had the Gallery, Dad, think what I could do. I could make Eric
Cobbley's name in no time, and ever so many others."</p>

<p>"Names worth making make themselves in time."</p>

<p>"When they're dead."</p>

<p>"Did you ever know anybody living, my dear, improved by having
his name made?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you," said June, pressing his arm.</p>

<p>Jolyon started. 'I?' he thought. 'Oh! Ah! Now she's going to ask
me to do something. We take it out, we Forsytes, each in our
different ways.'</p>

<p>June came closer to him in the cab.</p>

<p>"Darling," she said, "you buy the Gallery, and I'll pay you four
hundred a year for it. Then neither of us will be any the worse
off. Besides, it's a splendid investment."</p>

<p>Jolyon wriggled. "Don't you think," he said, "that for an artist
to buy a Gallery is a bit dubious? Besides, ten thousand pounds is
a lump, and I'm not a commercial character."</p>

<p>June looked at him with admiring appraisement.</p>

<p>"Of course you're not, but you're awfully businesslike. And I'm
sure we could make it pay. It'll be a perfect way of scoring off
those wretched dealers and people." And again she squeezed her
father's arm.</p>

<p>Jolyon's face expressed quizzical despair.</p>

<p>"Where is this desirable Gallery? Splendidly situated, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Just off Cork Street."</p>

<p>'Ah!' thought Jolyon, 'I knew it was just off somewhere. Now for
what I want out of her!'</p>

<p>"Well, I'll think of it, but not just now. You remember Irene? I
want you to come with me and see her. Soames is after her again.
She might be safer if we could give her asylum somewhere."</p>

<p>The word asylum, which he had used by chance, was of all most
calculated to rouse June's interest.</p>

<p>"Irene! I haven't seen her since! Of course! I'd love to help
her."</p>

<p>It was Jolyon's turn to squeeze her arm, in warm admiration for
this spirited, generous-hearted little creature of his
begetting.</p>

<p>"Irene is proud," he said, with a sidelong glance, in sudden
doubt of June's discretion; "she's difficult to help. We must tread
gently. This is the place. I wired her to expect us. Let's send up
our cards."</p>

<p>"I can't bear Soames," said June as she got out; "he sneers at
everything that isn't successful."</p>

<p>Irene was in what was called the 'Ladies' drawing-room' of the
Piedmont Hotel.</p>

<p>Nothing if not morally courageous, June walked straight up to
her former friend, kissed her cheek, and the two settled down on a
sofa never sat on since the hotel's foundation. Jolyon could see
that Irene was deeply affected by this simple forgiveness.</p>

<p>"So Soames has been worrying you?" he said.</p>

<p>"I had a visit from him last night; he wants me to go back to
him."</p>

<p>"You're not going, of course?" cried June.</p>

<p>Irene smiled faintly and shook her head. "But his position is
horrible," she murmured.</p>

<p>"It's his own fault; he ought to have divorced you when he
could."</p>

<p>Jolyon remembered how fervently in the old days June had hoped
that no divorce would smirch her dead and faithless lover's
name.</p>

<p>"Let us hear what Irene is going to do," he said.</p>

<p>Irene's lips quivered, but she spoke calmly.</p>

<p>"I'd better give him fresh excuse to get rid of me."</p>

<p>"How horrible!" cried June.</p>

<p>"What else can I do?"</p>

<p>"Out of the question," said Jolyon very quietly, "sans
amour."</p>

<p>He thought she was going to cry; but, getting up quickly, she
half turned her back on them, and stood regaining control of
herself.</p>

<p>June said suddenly:</p>

<p>"Well, I shall go to Soames and tell him he must leave you
alone. What does he want at his age?"</p>

<p>"A child. It's not unnatural"</p>

<p>"A child!" cried June scornfully. "Of course! To leave his money
to. If he wants one badly enough let him take somebody and have
one; then you can divorce him, and he can marry her."</p>

<p>Jolyon perceived suddenly that he had made a mistake to bring
June&mdash;her violent partizanship was fighting Soames'
battle.</p>

<p>"It would be best for Irene to come quietly to us at Robin Hill,
and see how things shape."</p>

<p>"Of course," said June; "only..."</p>

<p>Irene looked full at Jolyon&mdash;in all his many attempts
afterwards to analyze that glance he never could succeed.</p>

<p>"No! I should only bring trouble on you all. I will go
abroad."</p>

<p>He knew from her voice that this was final. The irrelevant
thought flashed through him: 'Well, I could see her there.' But he
said:</p>

<p>"Don't you think you would be more helpless abroad, in case he
followed?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I can but try."</p>

<p>June sprang up and paced the room. "It's all horrible," she
said. "Why should people be tortured and kept miserable and
helpless year after year by this disgusting sanctimonious law?" But
someone had come into the room, and June came to a standstill.
Jolyon went up to Irene:</p>

<p>"Do you want money?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And would you like me to let your flat?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jolyon, please."</p>

<p>"When shall you be going?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"You won't go back there in the meantime, will you?" This he
said with an anxiety strange to himself.</p>

<p>"No; I've got all I want here."</p>

<p>"You'll send me your address?"</p>

<p>She put out her hand to him. "I feel you're a rock."</p>

<p>"Built on sand," answered Jolyon, pressing her hand hard; "but
it's a pleasure to do anything, at any time, remember that. And if
you change your mind...! Come along, June; say good-bye."</p>

<p>June came from the window and flung her arms round Irene.</p>

<p>"Don't think of him," she said under her breath; "enjoy
yourself, and bless you!"</p>

<p>With a memory of tears in Irene's eyes, and of a smile on her
lips, they went away extremely silent, passing the lady who had
interrupted the interview and was turning over the papers on the
table.</p>

<p>Opposite the National Gallery June exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Of all undignified beasts and horrible laws!"</p>

<p>But Jolyon did not respond. He had something of his father's
balance, and could see things impartially even when his emotions
were roused. Irene was right; Soames' position was as bad or worse
than her own. As for the law&mdash;it catered for a human nature of
which it took a naturally low view. And, feeling that if he stayed
in his daughter's company he would in one way or another commit an
indiscretion, he told her he must catch his train back to Oxford;
and hailing a cab, left her to Turner's water-colours, with the
promise that he would think over that Gallery.</p>

<p>But he thought over Irene instead. Pity, they said, was akin to
love! If so he was certainly in danger of loving her, for he pitied
her profoundly. To think of her drifting about Europe so
handicapped and lonely! 'I hope to goodness she'll keep her head!'
he thought; 'she might easily grow desperate.' In fact, now that
she had cut loose from her poor threads of occupation, he couldn't
imagine how she would go on&mdash;so beautiful a creature,
hopeless, and fair game for anyone! In his exasperation was more
than a little fear and jealousy. Women did strange things when they
were driven into corners. 'I wonder what Soames will do now!' he
thought. 'A rotten, idiotic state of things! And I suppose they
would say it was her own fault.' Very preoccupied and sore at
heart, he got into his train, mislaid his ticket, and on the
platform at Oxford took his hat off to a lady whose face he seemed
to remember without being able to put a name to her, not even when
he saw her having tea at the Rainbow.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER IV&mdash;WHERE FORSYTES FEAR TO TREAD</h3>

<p>Quivering from the defeat of his hopes, with the green morocco
case still flat against his heart, Soames revolved thoughts bitter
as death. A spider's web! Walking fast, and noting nothing in the
moonlight, he brooded over the scene he had been through, over the
memory of her figure rigid in his grasp. And the more he brooded,
the more certain he became that she had a lover&mdash;her words, 'I
would sooner die!' were ridiculous if she had not. Even if she had
never loved him, she had made no fuss until Bosinney came on the
scene. No; she was in love again, or she would not have made that
melodramatic answer to his proposal, which in all the circumstances
was reasonable! Very well! That simplified matters.</p>

<p>'I'll take steps to know where I am,' he thought; 'I'll go to
Polteed's the first thing tomorrow morning.'</p>

<p>But even in forming that resolution he knew he would have
trouble with himself. He had employed Polteed's agency several
times in the routine of his profession, even quite lately over
Dartie's case, but he had never thought it possible to employ them
to watch his own wife.</p>

<p>It was too insulting to himself!</p>

<p>He slept over that project and his wounded pride&mdash;or
rather, kept vigil. Only while shaving did he suddenly remember
that she called herself by her maiden name of Heron. Polteed would
not know, at first at all events, whose wife she was, would not
look at him obsequiously and leer behind his back. She would just
be the wife of one of his clients. And that would be true&mdash;for
was he not his own solicitor?</p>

<p>He was literally afraid not to put his design into execution at
the first possible moment, lest, after all, he might fail himself.
And making Warmson bring him an early cup of coffee; he stole out
of the house before the hour of breakfast. He walked rapidly to one
of those small West End streets where Polteed's and other firms
ministered to the virtues of the wealthier classes. Hitherto he had
always had Polteed to see him in the Poultry; but he well knew
their address, and reached it at the opening hour. In the outer
office, a room furnished so cosily that it might have been a
money-lender's, he was attended by a lady who might have been a
schoolmistress.</p>

<p>"I wish to see Mr. Claud Polteed. He knows me&mdash;never mind
my name."</p>

<p>To keep everybody from knowing that he, Soames Forsyte, was
reduced to having his wife spied on, was the overpowering
consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. Claud Polteed&mdash;so different from Mr. Lewis
Polteed&mdash;was one of those men with dark hair, slightly curved
noses, and quick brown eyes, who might be taken for Jews but are
really Phoenicians; he received Soames in a room hushed by
thickness of carpet and curtains. It was, in fact, confidentially
furnished, without trace of document anywhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Greeting Soames deferentially, he turned the key in the only
door with a certain ostentation.</p>

<p>"If a client sends for me," he was in the habit of saying, "he
takes what precaution he likes. If he comes here, we convince him
that we have no leakages. I may safely say we lead in security, if
in nothing else...Now, sir, what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>Soames' gorge had risen so that he could hardly speak. It was
absolutely necessary to hide from this man that he had any but
professional interest in the matter; and, mechanically, his face
assumed its sideway smile.</p>

<p>"I've come to you early like this because there's not an hour to
lose"&mdash;if he lost an hour he might fail himself yet! "Have you
a really trustworthy woman free?"</p>

<p>Mr. Polteed unlocked a drawer, produced a memorandum, ran his
eyes over it, and locked the drawer up again.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "the very woman."</p>

<p>Soames had seated himself and crossed his legs&mdash;nothing but
a faint flush, which might have been his normal complexion,
betrayed him.</p>

<p>"Send her off at once, then, to watch a Mrs. Irene Heron of Flat
C, Truro Mansions, Chelsea, till further notice."</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Mr. Polteed; "divorce, I presume?" and he blew
into a speaking-tube. "Mrs. Blanch in? I shall want to speak to her
in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"Deal with any reports yourself," resumed Soames, "and send them
to me personally, marked confidential, sealed and registered. My
client exacts the utmost secrecy."</p>

<p>Mr. Polteed smiled, as though saying, 'You are teaching your
grandmother, my dear sir;' and his eyes slid over Soames' face for
one unprofessional instant.</p>

<p>"Make his mind perfectly easy," he said. "Do you smoke?"</p>

<p>"No," said Soames. "Understand me: Nothing may come of this. If
a name gets out, or the watching is suspected, it may have very
serious consequences."</p>

<p>Mr. Polteed nodded. "I can put it into the cipher category.
Under that system a name is never mentioned; we work by
numbers."</p>

<p>He unlocked another drawer and took out two slips of paper,
wrote on them, and handed one to Soames.</p>

<p>"Keep that, sir; it's your key. I retain this duplicate. The
case we'll call 7x. The party watched will be 17; the watcher 19;
the Mansions 25; yourself&mdash;I should say, your firm&mdash;31;
my firm 32, myself 2. In case you should have to mention your
client in writing I have called him 43; any person we suspect will
be 47; a second person 51. Any special hint or instruction while
we're about it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Soames; "that is&mdash;every consideration
compatible."</p>

<p>Again Mr. Polteed nodded. "Expense?"</p>

<p>Soames shrugged. "In reason," he answered curtly, and got up.
"Keep it entirely in your own hands."</p>

<p>"Entirely," said Mr. Polteed, appearing suddenly between him and
the door. "I shall be seeing you in that other case before long.
Good morning, sir." His eyes slid unprofessionally over Soames once
more, and he unlocked the door.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Soames, looking neither to right nor
left.</p>

<p>Out in the street he swore deeply, quietly, to himself. A
spider's web, and to cut it he must use this spidery, secret,
unclean method, so utterly repugnant to one who regarded his
private life as his most sacred piece of property. But the die was
cast, he could not go back. And he went on into the Poultry, and
locked away the green morocco case and the key to that cipher
destined to make crystal-clear his domestic bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Odd that one whose life was spent in bringing to the public eye
all the private coils of property, the domestic disagreements of
others, should dread so utterly the public eye turned on his own;
and yet not odd, for who should know so well as he the whole
unfeeling process of legal regulation.</p>

<p>He worked hard all day. Winifred was due at four o'clock; he was
to take her down to a conference in the Temple with Dreamer Q.C.,
and waiting for her he re-read the letter he had caused her to
write the day of Dartie's departure, requiring him to return.</p>

<blockquote>"DEAR MONTAGUE,<br>
<br>
"I have received your letter with the news that you have left me
for ever and are on your way to Buenos Aires. It has naturally been
a great shock. I am taking this earliest opportunity of writing to
tell you that I am prepared to let bygones be bygones if you will
return to me at once. I beg you to do so. I am very much upset, and
will not say any more now. I am sending this letter registered to
the address you left at your Club. Please cable to me.<br>
<br>
"Your still affectionate wife,<br>
"WINIFRED DARTIE."</blockquote>

<p>Ugh! What bitter humbug! He remembered leaning over Winifred
while she copied what he had pencilled, and how she had said,
laying down her pen, "Suppose he comes, Soames!" in such a strange
tone of voice, as if she did not know her own mind. "He won't
come," he had answered, "till he's spent his money. That's why we
must act at once." Annexed to the copy of that letter was the
original of Dartie's drunken scrawl from the Iseeum Club. Soames
could have wished it had not been so manifestly penned in liquor.
Just the sort of thing the Court would pitch on. He seemed to hear
the Judge's voice say: "You took this seriously! Seriously enough
to write him as you did? Do you think he meant it?" Never mind! The
fact was clear that Dartie had sailed and had not returned. Annexed
also was his cabled answer: "Impossible return. Dartie." Soames
shook his head. If the whole thing were not disposed of within the
next few months the fellow would turn up again like a bad penny. It
saved a thousand a year at least to get rid of him, besides all the
worry to Winifred and his father. 'I must stiffen Dreamer's back,'
he thought; 'we must push it on.'</p>

<p>Winifred, who had adopted a kind of half-mourning which became
her fair hair and tall figure very well, arrived in James' barouche
drawn by James' pair. Soames had not seen it in the City since his
father retired from business five years ago, and its incongruity
gave him a shock. 'Times are changing,' he thought; 'one doesn't
know what'll go next!' Top hats even were scarcer. He enquired
after Val. Val, said Winifred, wrote that he was going to play polo
next term. She thought he was in a very good set. She added with
fashionably disguised anxiety: "Will there be much publicity about
my affair, Soames? Must it be in the papers? It's so bad for him,
and the girls."</p>

<p>With his own calamity all raw within him, Soames answered:</p>

<p>"The papers are a pushing lot; it's very difficult to keep
things out. They pretend to be guarding the public's morals, and
they corrupt them with their beastly reports. But we haven't got to
that yet. We're only seeing Dreamer to-day on the restitution
question. Of course he understands that it's to lead to a divorce;
but you must seem genuinely anxious to get Dartie back&mdash;you
might practice that attitude to-day."</p>

<p>Winifred sighed.</p>

<p>"Oh! What a clown Monty's been!" she said.</p>

<p>Soames gave her a sharp look. It was clear to him that she could
not take her Dartie seriously, and would go back on the whole thing
if given half a chance. His own instinct had been firm in this
matter from the first. To save a little scandal now would only
bring on his sister and her children real disgrace and perhaps ruin
later on if Dartie were allowed to hang on to them, going down-hill
and spending the money James would leave his daughter. Though it
was all tied up, that fellow would milk the settlements somehow,
and make his family pay through the nose to keep him out of
bankruptcy or even perhaps gaol! They left the shining carriage,
with the shining horses and the shining-hatted servants on the
Embankment, and walked up to Dreamer Q.C.'s Chambers in Crown
Office Row.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bellby is here, sir," said the clerk; "Mr. Dreamer will be
ten minutes."</p>

<p>Mr. Bellby, the junior&mdash;not as junior as he might have
been, for Soames only employed barristers of established
reputation; it was, indeed, something of a mystery to him how
barristers ever managed to establish that which made him employ
them&mdash;Mr. Bellby was seated, taking a final glance through his
papers. He had come from Court, and was in wig and gown, which
suited a nose jutting out like the handle of a tiny pump, his small
shrewd blue eyes, and rather protruding lower lip&mdash;no better
man to supplement and stiffen Dreamer.</p>

<p>The introduction to Winifred accomplished, they leaped the
weather and spoke of the war. Soames interrupted suddenly:</p>

<p>"If he doesn't comply we can't bring proceedings for six months.
I want to get on with the matter, Bellby."</p>

<p>Mr. Bellby, who had the ghost of an Irish brogue, smiled at
Winifred and murmured: "The Law's delays, Mrs. Dartie."</p>

<p>"Six months!" repeated Soames; "it'll drive it up to June! We
shan't get the suit on till after the long vacation. We must put
the screw on, Bellby"&mdash;he would have all his work cut out to
keep Winifred up to the scratch.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dreamer will see you now, sir."</p>

<p>They filed in, Mr. Bellby going first, and Soames escorting
Winifred after an interval of one minute by his watch.</p>

<p>Dreamer Q.C., in a gown but divested of wig, was standing before
the fire, as if this conference were in the nature of a treat; he
had the leathery, rather oily complexion which goes with great
learning, a considerable nose with glasses perched on it, and
little greyish whiskers; he luxuriated in the perpetual cocking of
one eye, and the concealment of his lower with his upper lip, which
gave a smothered turn to his speech. He had a way, too, of coming
suddenly round the corner on the person he was talking to; this,
with a disconcerting tone of voice, and a habit of growling before
he began to speak&mdash;had secured a reputation second in Probate
and Divorce to very few. Having listened, eye cocked, to Mr.
Bellby's breezy recapitulation of the facts, he growled, and
said:</p>

<p>"I know all that;" and coming round the corner at Winifred,
smothered the words:</p>

<p>"We want to get him back, don't we, Mrs. Dartie?"</p>

<p>Soames interposed sharply:</p>

<p>"My sister's position, of course, is intolerable."</p>

<p>Dreamer growled. "Exactly. Now, can we rely on the cabled
refusal, or must we wait till after Christmas to give him a chance
to have written&mdash;that's the point, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"The sooner..." Soames began.</p>

<p>"What do you say, Bellby?" said Dreamer, coming round his
corner.</p>

<p>Mr. Bellby seemed to sniff the air like a hound.</p>

<p>"We won't be on till the middle of December. We've no need to
give um more rope than that."</p>

<p>"No," said Soames, "why should my sister be incommoded by his
choosing to go..."</p>

<p>"To Jericho!" said Dreamer, again coming round his corner;
"quite so. People oughtn't to go to Jericho, ought they, Mrs.
Dartie?" And he raised his gown into a sort of fantail. "I agree.
We can go forward. Is there anything more?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at present," said Soames meaningly; "I wanted you to
see my sister."</p>

<p>Dreamer growled softly: "Delighted. Good evening!" And let fall
the protection of his gown.</p>

<p>They filed out. Winifred went down the stairs. Soames lingered.
In spite of himself he was impressed by Dreamer.</p>

<p>"The evidence is all right, I think," he said to Bellby.
"Between ourselves, if we don't get the thing through quick, we
never may. D'you think he understands that?"</p>

<p>"I'll make um," said Bellby. "Good man though&mdash;good
man."</p>

<p>Soames nodded and hastened after his sister. He found her in a
draught, biting her lips behind her veil, and at once said:</p>

<p>"The evidence of the stewardess will be very complete."</p>

<p>Winifred's face hardened; she drew herself up, and they walked
to the carriage. And, all through that silent drive back to Green
Street, the souls of both of them revolved a single thought: 'Why,
oh! why should I have to expose my misfortune to the public like
this? Why have to employ spies to peer into my private troubles?
They were not of my making.'</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER V&mdash;JOLLY SITS IN JUDGMENT</h3>

<p>The possessive instinct, which, so determinedly balked, was
animating two members of the Forsyte family towards riddance of
what they could no longer possess, was hardening daily in the
British body politic. Nicholas, originally so doubtful concerning a
war which must affect property, had been heard to say that these
Boers were a pig-headed lot; they were causing a lot of expense,
and the sooner they had their lesson the better. He would send out
Wolseley! Seeing always a little further than other
people&mdash;whence the most considerable fortune of all the
Forsytes&mdash;he had perceived already that Buller was not the
man&mdash;'a bull of a chap, who just went butting, and if they
didn't look out Ladysmith would fall.' This was early in December,
so that when Black Week came, he was enabled to say to everybody:
'I told you so.' During that week of gloom such as no Forsyte could
remember, very young Nicholas attended so many drills in his corps,
'The Devil's Own,' that young Nicholas consulted the family
physician about his son's health and was alarmed to find that he
was perfectly sound. The boy had only just eaten his dinners and
been called to the bar, at some expense, and it was in a way a
nightmare to his father and mother that he should be playing with
military efficiency at a time when military efficiency in the
civilian population might conceivably be wanted. His grandfather,
of course, pooh-poohed the notion, too thoroughly educated in the
feeling that no British war could be other than little and
professional, and profoundly distrustful of Imperial commitments,
by which, moreover, he stood to lose, for he owned De Beers, now
going down fast, more than a sufficient sacrifice on the part of
his grandson.</p>

<p>At Oxford, however, rather different sentiments prevailed. The
inherent effervescence of conglomerate youth had, during the two
months of the term before Black Week, been gradually crystallising
out into vivid oppositions. Normal adolescence, ever in England of
a conservative tendency though not taking things too seriously, was
vehement for a fight to a finish and a good licking for the Boers.
Of this larger faction Val Dartie was naturally a member. Radical
youth, on the other hand, a small but perhaps more vocal body, was
for stopping the war and giving the Boers autonomy. Until Black
Week, however, the groups were amorphous, without sharp edges, and
argument remained but academic. Jolly was one of those who knew not
where he stood. A streak of his grandfather old Jolyon's love of
justice prevented, him from seeing one side only. Moreover, in his
set of 'the best' there was a 'jumping-Jesus' of extremely advanced
opinions and some personal magnetism. Jolly wavered. His father,
too, seemed doubtful in his views. And though, as was proper at the
age of twenty, he kept a sharp eye on his father, watchful for
defects which might still be remedied, still that father had an
'air' which gave a sort of glamour to his creed of ironic
tolerance. Artists of course; were notoriously Hamlet-like, and to
this extent one must discount for one's father, even if one loved
him. But Jolyon's original view, that to 'put your nose in where
you aren't wanted' (as the Uitlanders had done) 'and then work the
oracle till you get on top is not being quite the clean potato,'
had, whether founded in fact or no, a certain attraction for his
son, who thought a deal about gentility. On the other hand Jolly
could not abide such as his set called 'cranks,' and Val's set
called 'smugs,' so that he was still balancing when the clock of
Black Week struck. One&mdash;two&mdash;three, came those ominous
repulses at Stormberg, Magersfontein, Colenso. The sturdy English
soul reacting after the first cried, 'Ah! but Methuen!' after the
second: 'Ah! but Buller!' then, in inspissated gloom, hardened. And
Jolly said to himself: 'No, damn it! We've got to lick the beggars
now; I don't care whether we're right or wrong.' And, if he had
known it, his father was thinking the same thought.</p>

<p>That next Sunday, last of the term, Jolly was bidden to wine
with 'one of the best.' After the second toast, 'Buller and
damnation to the Boers,' drunk&mdash;no heel taps&mdash;in the
college Burgundy, he noticed that Val Dartie, also a guest, was
looking at him with a grin and saying something to his neighbour.
He was sure it was disparaging. The last boy in the world to make
himself conspicuous or cause public disturbance, Jolly grew rather
red and shut his lips. The queer hostility he had always felt
towards his second-cousin was strongly and suddenly reinforced.
'All right!' he thought, 'you wait, my friend!' More wine than was
good for him, as the custom was, helped him to remember, when they
all trooped forth to a secluded spot, to touch Val on the arm.</p>

<p>"What did you say about me in there?"</p>

<p>"Mayn't I say what I like?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, I said you were a pro-Boer&mdash;and so you are!"</p>

<p>"You're a liar!"</p>

<p>"D'you want a row?"</p>

<p>"Of course, but not here; in the garden."</p>

<p>"All right. Come on."</p>

<p>They went, eyeing each other askance, unsteady, and unflinching;
they climbed the garden railings. The spikes on the top slightly
ripped Val's sleeve, and occupied his mind. Jolly's mind was
occupied by the thought that they were going to fight in the
precincts of a college foreign to them both. It was not the thing,
but never mind&mdash;the young beast!</p>

<p>They passed over the grass into very nearly darkness, and took
off their coats.</p>

<p>"You're not screwed, are you?" said Jolly suddenly. "I can't
fight you if you're screwed."</p>

<p>"No more than you."</p>

<p>"All right then."</p>

<p>Without shaking hands, they put themselves at once into postures
of defence. They had drunk too much for science, and so were
especially careful to assume correct attitudes, until Jolly smote
Val almost accidentally on the nose. After that it was all a dark
and ugly scrimmage in the deep shadow of the old trees, with no one
to call 'time,' till, battered and blown, they unclinched and
staggered back from each other, as a voice said:</p>

<p>"Your names, young gentlemen?"</p>

<p>At this bland query spoken from under the lamp at the garden
gate, like some demand of a god, their nerves gave way, and
snatching up their coats, they ran at the railings, shinned up
them, and made for the secluded spot whence they had issued to the
fight. Here, in dim light, they mopped their faces, and without a
word walked, ten paces apart, to the college gate. They went out
silently, Val going towards the Broad along the Brewery, Jolly down
the lane towards the High. His head, still fumed, was busy with
regret that he had not displayed more science, passing in review
the counters and knockout blows which he had not delivered. His
mind strayed on to an imagined combat, infinitely unlike that which
he had just been through, infinitely gallant, with sash and sword,
with thrust and parry, as if he were in the pages of his beloved
Dumas. He fancied himself La Mole, and Aramis, Bussy, Chicot, and
D'Artagnan rolled into one, but he quite failed to envisage Val as
Coconnas, Brissac, or Rochefort. The fellow was just a confounded
cousin who didn't come up to Cocker. Never mind! He had given him
one or two. 'Pro-Boer!' The word still rankled, and thoughts of
enlisting jostled his aching head; of riding over the veldt, firing
gallantly, while the Boers rolled over like rabbits. And, turning
up his smarting eyes, he saw the stars shining between the
housetops of the High, and himself lying out on the Karoo (whatever
that was) rolled in a blanket, with his rifle ready and his gaze
fixed on a glittering heaven.</p>

<p>He had a fearful 'head' next morning, which he doctored, as
became one of 'the best,' by soaking it in cold water, brewing
strong coffee which he could not drink, and only sipping a little
Hock at lunch. The legend that 'some fool' had run into him round a
corner accounted for a bruise on his cheek. He would on no account
have mentioned the fight, for, on second thoughts, it fell far
short of his standards.</p>

<p>The next day he went 'down,' and travelled through to Robin
Hill. Nobody was there but June and Holly, for his father had gone
to Paris. He spent a restless and unsettled Vacation, quite out of
touch with either of his sisters. June, indeed, was occupied with
lame ducks, whom, as a rule, Jolly could not stand, especially that
Eric Cobbley and his family, 'hopeless outsiders,' who were always
littering up the house in the Vacation. And between Holly and
himself there was a strange division, as if she were beginning to
have opinions of her own, which was so&mdash;unnecessary. He
punched viciously at a ball, rode furiously but alone in Richmond
Park, making a point of jumping the stiff, high hurdles put up to
close certain worn avenues of grass&mdash;keeping his nerve in, he
called it. Jolly was more afraid of being afraid than most boys
are. He bought a rifle, too, and put a range up in the home field,
shooting across the pond into the kitchen-garden wall, to the peril
of gardeners, with the thought that some day, perhaps, he would
enlist and save South Africa for his country. In fact, now that
they were appealing for Yeomanry recruits the boy was thoroughly
upset. Ought he to go? None of 'the best,' so far as he
knew&mdash;and he was in correspondence with several&mdash;were
thinking of joining. If they had been making a move he would have
gone at once&mdash;very competitive, and with a strong sense of
form, he could not bear to be left behind in anything&mdash;but to
do it off his own bat might look like 'swagger'; because of course
it wasn't really necessary. Besides, he did not want to go, for the
other side of this young Forsyte recoiled from leaping before he
looked. It was altogether mixed pickles within him, hot and sickly
pickles, and he became quite unlike his serene and rather lordly
self.</p>

<p>And then one day he saw that which moved him to uneasy
wrath&mdash;two riders, in a glade of the Park close to the Ham
Gate, of whom she on the left-hand was most assuredly Holly on her
silver roan, and he on the right-hand as assuredly that 'squirt'
Val Dartie. His first impulse was to urge on his own horse and
demand the meaning of this portent, tell the fellow to 'bunk,' and
take Holly home. His second&mdash;to feel that he would look a fool
if they refused. He reined his horse in behind a tree, then
perceived that it was equally impossible to spy on them. Nothing
for it but to go home and await her coming! Sneaking out with that
young bounder! He could not consult with June, because she had gone
up that morning in the train of Eric Cobbley and his lot. And his
father was still in 'that rotten Paris.' He felt that this was
emphatically one of those moments for which he had trained himself,
assiduously, at school, where he and a boy called Brent had
frequently set fire to newspapers and placed them in the centre of
their studies to accustom them to coolness in moments of danger. He
did not feel at all cool waiting in the stable-yard, idly stroking
the dog Balthasar, who queasy as an old fat monk, and sad in the
absence of his master, turned up his face, panting with gratitude
for this attention. It was half an hour before Holly came, flushed
and ever so much prettier than she had any right to look. He saw
her look at him quickly&mdash;guiltily of course&mdash;then
followed her in, and, taking her arm, conducted her into what had
been their grandfather's study. The room, not much used now, was
still vaguely haunted for them both by a presence with which they
associated tenderness, large drooping white moustaches, the scent
of cigar smoke, and laughter. Here Jolly, in the prime of his
youth, before he went to school at all, had been wont to wrestle
with his grandfather, who even at eighty had an irresistible habit
of crooking his leg. Here Holly, perched on the arm of the great
leather chair, had stroked hair curving silvery over an ear into
which she would whisper secrets. Through that window they had all
three sallied times without number to cricket on the lawn, and a
mysterious game called 'Wopsy-doozle,' not to be understood by
outsiders, which made old Jolyon very hot. Here once on a warm
night Holly had appeared in her 'nighty,' having had a bad dream,
to have the clutch of it released. And here Jolly, having begun the
day badly by introducing fizzy magnesia into Mademoiselle Beauce's
new-laid egg, and gone on to worse, had been sent down (in the
absence of his father) to the ensuing dialogue:</p>

<p>"Now, my boy, you mustn't go on like this."</p>

<p>"Well, she boxed my ears, Gran, so I only boxed hers, and then
she boxed mine again."</p>

<p>"Strike a lady? That'll never do! Have you begged her
pardon?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"Then you must go and do it at once. Come along."</p>

<p>"But she began it, Gran; and she had two to my one."</p>

<p>"My dear, it was an outrageous thing to do."</p>

<p>"Well, she lost her temper; and I didn't lose mine."</p>

<p>"Come along."</p>

<p>"You come too, then, Gran."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;this time only."</p>

<p>And they had gone hand in hand.</p>

<p>Here&mdash;where the Waverley novels and Byron's works and
Gibbon's Roman Empire and Humboldt's Cosmos, and the bronzes on the
mantelpiece, and that masterpiece of the oily school, 'Dutch
Fishing-Boats at Sunset,' were fixed as fate, and for all sign of
change old Jolyon might have been sitting there still, with legs
crossed, in the arm chair, and domed forehead and deep eyes grave
above The Times&mdash;here they came, those two grandchildren. And
Jolly said:</p>

<p>"I saw you and that fellow in the Park."</p>

<p>The sight of blood rushing into her cheeks gave him some
satisfaction; she ought to be ashamed!</p>

<p>"Well?" she said.</p>

<p>Jolly was surprised; he had expected more, or less.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said weightily, "that he called me a pro-Boer
last term? And I had to fight him."</p>

<p>"Who won?"</p>

<p>Jolly wished to answer: 'I should have,' but it seemed beneath
him.</p>

<p>"Look here!" he said, "what's the meaning of it? Without telling
anybody!"</p>

<p>"Why should I? Dad isn't here; why shouldn't I ride with
him?"</p>

<p>"You've got me to ride with. I think he's an awful young
rotter."</p>

<p>Holly went pale with anger.</p>

<p>"He isn't. It's your own fault for not liking him."</p>

<p>And slipping past her brother she went out, leaving him staring
at the bronze Venus sitting on a tortoise, which had been shielded
from him so far by his sister's dark head under her soft felt
riding hat. He felt queerly disturbed, shaken to his young
foundations. A lifelong domination lay shattered round his feet. He
went up to the Venus and mechanically inspected the tortoise.</p>

<p>Why didn't he like Val Dartie? He could not tell. Ignorant of
family history, barely aware of that vague feud which had started
thirteen years before with Bosinney's defection from June in favour
of Soames' wife, knowing really almost nothing about Val he was at
sea. He just did dislike him. The question, however, was: What
should he do? Val Dartie, it was true, was a second-cousin, but it
was not the thing for Holly to go about with him. And yet to 'tell'
of what he had chanced on was against his creed. In this dilemma he
went and sat in the old leather chair and crossed his legs. It grew
dark while he sat there staring out through the long window at the
old oak-tree, ample yet bare of leaves, becoming slowly just a
shape of deeper dark printed on the dusk.</p>

<p>'Grandfather!' he thought without sequence, and took out his
watch. He could not see the hands, but he set the repeater going.
'Five o'clock!' His grandfather's first gold hunter watch,
butter-smooth with age&mdash;all the milling worn from it, and
dented with the mark of many a fall. The chime was like a little
voice from out of that golden age, when they first came from St.
John's Wood, London, to this house&mdash;came driving with
grandfather in his carriage, and almost instantly took to the
trees. Trees to climb, and grandfather watering the geranium-beds
below! What was to be done? Tell Dad he must come home? Confide in
June?&mdash;only she was so&mdash;so sudden! Do nothing and trust
to luck? After all, the Vac. would soon be over. Go up and see Val
and warn him off? But how get his address? Holly wouldn't give it
him! A maze of paths, a cloud of possibilities! He lit a cigarette.
When he had smoked it halfway through his brow relaxed, almost as
if some thin old hand had been passed gently over it; and in his
ear something seemed to whisper: 'Do nothing; be nice to Holly, be
nice to her, my dear!' And Jolly heaved a sigh of contentment,
blowing smoke through his nostrils...</p>

<p>But up in her room, divested of her habit, Holly was still
frowning. 'He is not&mdash;he is not!' were the words which kept
forming on her lips.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER VI&mdash;JOLYON IN TWO MINDS</h3>

<p>A little private hotel over a well-known restaurant near the
Gare St. Lazare was Jolyon's haunt in Paris. He hated his fellow
Forsytes abroad&mdash;vapid as fish out of water in their
well-trodden runs, the Opera, Rue de Rivoli, and Moulin Rouge.
Their air of having come because they wanted to be somewhere else
as soon as possible annoyed him. But no other Forsyte came near
this haunt, where he had a wood fire in his bedroom and the coffee
was excellent. Paris was always to him more attractive in winter.
The acrid savour from woodsmoke and chestnut-roasting braziers, the
sharpness of the wintry sunshine on bright rays, the open cafes
defying keen-aired winter, the self-contained brisk boulevard
crowds, all informed him that in winter Paris possessed a soul
which, like a migrant bird, in high summer flew away.</p>

<p>He spoke French well, had some friends, knew little places where
pleasant dishes could be met with, queer types observed. He felt
philosophic in Paris, the edge of irony sharpened; life took on a
subtle, purposeless meaning, became a bunch of flavours tasted, a
darkness shot with shifting gleams of light.</p>

<p>When in the first week of December he decided to go to Paris, he
was far from admitting that Irene's presence was influencing him.
He had not been there two days before he owned that the wish to see
her had been more than half the reason. In England one did not
admit what was natural. He had thought it might be well to speak to
her about the letting of her flat and other matters, but in Paris
he at once knew better. There was a glamour over the city. On the
third day he wrote to her, and received an answer which procured
him a pleasurable shiver of the nerves:</p>

<blockquote>"MY DEAR JOLYON,<br>
<br>
"It will be a happiness for me to see you.<br>
<br>
"IRENE."</blockquote>

<p>He took his way to her hotel on a bright day with a feeling such
as he had often had going to visit an adored picture. No woman, so
far as he remembered, had ever inspired in him this special
sensuous and yet impersonal sensation. He was going to sit and
feast his eyes, and come away knowing her no better, but ready to
go and feast his eyes again to-morrow. Such was his feeling, when
in the tarnished and ornate little lounge of a quiet hotel near the
river she came to him preceded by a small page-boy who uttered the
word, "Madame," and vanished. Her face, her smile, the poise of her
figure, were just as he had pictured, and the expression of her
face said plainly: 'A friend!'</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "what news, poor exile?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Nothing from Soames?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"I have let the flat for you, and like a good steward I bring
you some money. How do you like Paris?"</p>

<p>While he put her through this catechism, it seemed to him that
he had never seen lips so fine and sensitive, the lower lip curving
just a little upwards, the upper touched at one corner by the least
conceivable dimple. It was like discovering a woman in what had
hitherto been a sort of soft and breathed-on statue, almost
impersonally admired. She owned that to be alone in Paris was a
little difficult; and yet, Paris was so full of its own life that
it was often, she confessed, as innocuous as a desert. Besides, the
English were not liked just now!</p>

<p>"That will hardly be your case," said Jolyon; "you should appeal
to the French."</p>

<p>"It has its disadvantages."</p>

<p>Jolyon nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, you must let me take you about while I'm here. We'll
start to-morrow. Come and dine at my pet restaurant; and we'll go
to the Opera-Comique."</p>

<p>It was the beginning of daily meetings.</p>

<p>Jolyon soon found that for those who desired a static condition
of the affections, Paris was at once the first and last place in
which to be friendly with a pretty woman. Revelation was alighting
like a bird in his heart, singing: 'Elle est ton reve! Elle est ton
reve! Sometimes this seemed natural, sometimes ludicrous&mdash;a
bad case of elderly rapture. Having once been ostracised by
Society, he had never since had any real regard for conventional
morality; but the idea of a love which she could never
return&mdash;and how could she at his age?&mdash;hardly mounted
beyond his subconscious mind. He was full, too, of resentment, at
the waste and loneliness of her life. Aware of being some comfort
to her, and of the pleasure she clearly took in their many little
outings, he was amiably desirous of doing and saying nothing to
destroy that pleasure. It was like watching a starved plant draw up
water, to see her drink in his companionship. So far as they could
tell, no one knew her address except himself; she was unknown in
Paris, and he but little known, so that discretion seemed
unnecessary in those walks, talks, visits to concerts,
picture-galleries, theatres, little dinners, expeditions to
Versailles, St. Cloud, even Fontainebleau. And time fled&mdash;one
of those full months without past to it or future. What in his
youth would certainly have been headlong passion, was now perhaps
as deep a feeling, but far gentler, tempered to protective
companionship by admiration, hopelessness, and a sense of
chivalry&mdash;arrested in his veins at least so long as she was
there, smiling and happy in their friendship, and always to him
more beautiful and spiritually responsive: for her philosophy of
life seemed to march in admirable step with his own, conditioned by
emotion more than by reason, ironically mistrustful, susceptible to
beauty, almost passionately humane and tolerant, yet subject to
instinctive rigidities of which as a mere man he was less capable.
And during all this companionable month he never quite lost that
feeling with which he had set out on the first day as if to visit
an adored work of art, a well-nigh impersonal desire. The
future&mdash;inexorable pendant to the present he took care not to
face, for fear of breaking up his untroubled manner; but he made
plans to renew this time in places still more delightful, where the
sun was hot and there were strange things to see and paint. The end
came swiftly on the 20th of January with a telegram:</p>

<p>"Have enlisted in Imperial Yeomanry. JOLLY."</p>

<p>Jolyon received it just as he was setting out to meet her at the
Louvre. It brought him up with a round turn. While he was
lotus-eating here, his boy, whose philosopher and guide he ought to
be, had taken this great step towards danger, hardship, perhaps
even death. He felt disturbed to the soul, realising suddenly how
Irene had twined herself round the roots of his being. Thus
threatened with severance, the tie between them&mdash;for it had
become a kind of tie&mdash;no longer had impersonal quality. The
tranquil enjoyment of things in common, Jolyon perceived, was gone
for ever. He saw his feeling as it was, in the nature of an
infatuation. Ridiculous, perhaps, but so real that sooner or later
it must disclose itself. And now, as it seemed to him, he could
not, must not, make any such disclosure. The news of Jolly stood
inexorably in the way. He was proud of this enlistment; proud of
his boy for going off to fight for the country; for on Jolyon's
pro-Boerism, too, Black Week had left its mark. And so the end was
reached before the beginning! Well, luckily he had never made a
sign!</p>

<p>When he came into the Gallery she was standing before the
'Virgin of the Rocks,' graceful, absorbed, smiling and unconscious.
'Have I to give up seeing that?' he thought. 'It's unnatural, so
long as she's willing that I should see her.' He stood, unnoticed,
watching her, storing up the image of her figure, envying the
picture on which she was bending that long scrutiny. Twice she
turned her head towards the entrance, and he thought: 'That's for
me!' At last he went forward.</p>

<p>"Look!" he said.</p>

<p>She read the telegram, and he heard her sigh.</p>

<p>That sigh, too, was for him! His position was really cruel! To
be loyal to his son he must just shake her hand and go. To be loyal
to the feeling in his heart he must at least tell her what that
feeling was. Could she, would she understand the silence in which
he was gazing at that picture?</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I must go home at once," he said at last. "I shall
miss all this awfully."</p>

<p>"So shall I; but, of course, you must go."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Jolyon holding out his hand.</p>

<p>Meeting her eyes, a flood of feeling nearly mastered him.</p>

<p>"Such is life!" he said. "Take care of yourself, my dear!"</p>

<p>He had a stumbling sensation in his legs and feet, as if his
brain refused to steer him away from her. From the doorway, he saw
her lift her hand and touch its fingers with her lips. He raised
his hat solemnly, and did not look back again.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII&mdash;DARTIE VERSUS DARTIE</h3>

<p>The suit&mdash;Dartie versus Dartie&mdash;for restitution of
those conjugal rights concerning which Winifred was at heart so
deeply undecided, followed the laws of subtraction towards day of
judgment. This was not reached before the Courts rose for
Christmas, but the case was third on the list when they sat again.
Winifred spent the Christmas holidays a thought more fashionably
than usual, with the matter locked up in her low-cut bosom. James
was particularly liberal to her that Christmas, expressing thereby
his sympathy, and relief, at the approaching dissolution of her
marriage with that 'precious rascal,' which his old heart felt but
his old lips could not utter.</p>

<p>The disappearance of Dartie made the fall in Consols a
comparatively small matter; and as to the scandal&mdash;the real
animus he felt against that fellow, and the increasing lead which
property was attaining over reputation in a true Forsyte about to
leave this world, served to drug a mind from which all allusions to
the matter (except his own) were studiously kept. What worried him
as a lawyer and a parent was the fear that Dartie might suddenly
turn up and obey the Order of the Court when made. That would be a
pretty how-de-do! The fear preyed on him in fact so much that, in
presenting Winifred with a large Christmas cheque, he said: "It's
chiefly for that chap out there; to keep him from coming back." It
was, of course, to pitch away good money, but all in the nature of
insurance against that bankruptcy which would no longer hang over
him if only the divorce went through; and he questioned Winifred
rigorously until she could assure him that the money had been sent.
Poor woman!&mdash;it cost her many a pang to send what must find
its way into the vanity-bag of 'that creature!' Soames, hearing of
it, shook his head. They were not dealing with a Forsyte,
reasonably tenacious of his purpose. It was very risky without
knowing how the land lay out there. Still, it would look well with
the Court; and he would see that Dreamer brought it out. "I
wonder," he said suddenly, "where that ballet goes after the
Argentine"; never omitting a chance of reminder; for he knew that
Winifred still had a weakness, if not for Dartie, at least for not
laundering him in public. Though not good at showing admiration, he
admitted that she was behaving extremely well, with all her
children at home gaping like young birds for news of their
father&mdash;Imogen just on the point of coming out, and Val very
restive about the whole thing. He felt that Val was the real heart
of the matter to Winifred, who certainly loved him beyond her other
children. The boy could spoke the wheel of this divorce yet if he
set his mind to it. And Soames was very careful to keep the
proximity of the preliminary proceedings from his nephew's ears. He
did more. He asked him to dine at the Remove, and over Val's cigar
introduced the subject which he knew to be nearest to his
heart.</p>

<p>"I hear," he said, "that you want to play polo up at
Oxford."</p>

<p>Val became less recumbent in his chair.</p>

<p>"Rather!" he said.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Soames, "that's a very expensive business.
Your grandfather isn't likely to consent to it unless he can make
sure that he's not got any other drain on him." And he paused to
see whether the boy understood his meaning.</p>

<p>Val's thick dark lashes concealed his eyes, but a slight grimace
appeared on his wide mouth, and he muttered:</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean my Dad!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Soames; "I'm afraid it depends on whether he
continues to be a drag or not;" and said no more, letting the boy
dream it over.</p>

<p>But Val was also dreaming in those days of a silver-roan palfrey
and a girl riding it. Though Crum was in town and an introduction
to Cynthia Dark to be had for the asking, Val did not ask; indeed,
he shunned Crum and lived a life strange even to himself, except in
so far as accounts with tailor and livery stable were concerned. To
his mother, his sisters, his young brother, he seemed to spend this
Vacation in 'seeing fellows,' and his evenings sleepily at home.
They could not propose anything in daylight that did not meet with
the one response: "Sorry; I've got to see a fellow"; and he was put
to extraordinary shifts to get in and out of the house unobserved
in riding clothes; until, being made a member of the Goat's Club,
he was able to transport them there, where he could change
unregarded and slip off on his hack to Richmond Park. He kept his
growing sentiment religiously to himself. Not for a world would he
breathe to the 'fellows,' whom he was not 'seeing,' anything so
ridiculous from the point of view of their creed and his. But he
could not help its destroying his other appetites. It was coming
between him and the legitimate pleasures of youth at last on its
own in a way which must, he knew, make him a milksop in the eyes of
Crum. All he cared for was to dress in his last-created riding
togs, and steal away to the Robin Hill Gate, where presently the
silver roan would come demurely sidling with its slim and
dark-haired rider, and in the glades bare of leaves they would go
off side by side, not talking very much, riding races sometimes,
and sometimes holding hands. More than once of an evening, in a
moment of expansion, he had been tempted to tell his mother how
this shy sweet cousin had stolen in upon him and wrecked his
'life.' But bitter experience, that all persons above thirty-five
were spoil-sports, prevented him. After all, he supposed he would
have to go through with College, and she would have to 'come out,'
before they could be married; so why complicate things, so long as
he could see her? Sisters were teasing and unsympathetic beings, a
brother worse, so there was no one to confide in. Ah! And this
beastly divorce business! What a misfortune to have a name which
other people hadn't! If only he had been called Gordon or Scott or
Howard or something fairly common! But Dartie&mdash;there wasn't
another in the directory! One might as well have been named Morkin
for all the covert it afforded! So matters went on, till one day in
the middle of January the silver-roan palfrey and its rider were
missing at the tryst. Lingering in the cold, he debated whether he
should ride on to the house: But Jolly might be there, and the
memory of their dark encounter was still fresh within him. One
could not be always fighting with her brother! So he returned
dismally to town and spent an evening plunged in gloom. At
breakfast next day he noticed that his mother had on an unfamiliar
dress and was wearing her hat. The dress was black with a glimpse
of peacock blue, the hat black and large&mdash;she looked
exceptionally well. But when after breakfast she said to him, "Come
in here, Val," and led the way to the drawing-room, he was at once
beset by qualms. Winifred carefully shut the door and passed her
handkerchief over her lips; inhaling the violette de Parme with
which it had been soaked, Val thought: 'Has she found out about
Holly?'</p>

<p>Her voice interrupted</p>

<p>"Are you going to be nice to me, dear boy?"</p>

<p>Val grinned doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Will you come with me this morning..."</p>

<p>"I've got to see..." began Val, but something in her face
stopped him. "I say," he said, "you don't mean..."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have to go to the Court this morning."
Already!&mdash;that d&mdash;&mdash;d business which he had almost
succeeded in forgetting, since nobody ever mentioned it. In
self-commiseration he stood picking little bits of skin off his
fingers. Then noticing that his mother's lips were all awry, he
said impulsively: "All right, mother; I'll come. The brutes!" What
brutes he did not know, but the expression exactly summed up their
joint feeling, and restored a measure of equanimity.</p>

<p>"I suppose I'd better change into a 'shooter,"' he muttered,
escaping to his room. He put on the 'shooter,' a higher collar, a
pearl pin, and his neatest grey spats, to a somewhat blasphemous
accompaniment. Looking at himself in the glass, he said, "Well, I'm
damned if I'm going to show anything!" and went down. He found his
grandfather's carriage at the door, and his mother in furs, with
the appearance of one going to a Mansion House Assembly. They
seated themselves side by side in the closed barouche, and all the
way to the Courts of Justice Val made but one allusion to the
business in hand. "There'll be nothing about those pearls, will
there?"</p>

<p>The little tufted white tails of Winifred's muff began to
shiver.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said, "it'll be quite harmless to-day. Your
grandmother wanted to come too, but I wouldn't let her. I thought
you could take care of me. You look so nice, Val. Just pull your
coat collar up a little more at the back&mdash;that's right."</p>

<p>"If they bully you..." began Val.</p>

<p>"Oh! they won't. I shall be very cool. It's the only way."</p>

<p>"They won't want me to give evidence or anything?"</p>

<p>"No, dear; it's all arranged." And she patted his hand. The
determined front she was putting on it stayed the turmoil in Val's
chest, and he busied himself in drawing his gloves off and on. He
had taken what he now saw was the wrong pair to go with his spats;
they should have been grey, but were deerskin of a dark tan;
whether to keep them on or not he could not decide. They arrived
soon after ten. It was his first visit to the Law Courts, and the
building struck him at once.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he said as they passed into the hall, "this'd make
four or five jolly good racket courts."</p>

<p>Soames was awaiting them at the foot of some stairs.</p>

<p>"Here you are!" he said, without shaking hands, as if the event
had made them too familiar for such formalities. "It's Happerly
Browne, Court I. We shall be on first."</p>

<p>A sensation such as he had known when going in to bat was
playing now in the top of Val's chest, but he followed his mother
and uncle doggedly, looking at no more than he could help, and
thinking that the place smelled 'fuggy.' People seemed to be
lurking everywhere, and he plucked Soames by the sleeve.</p>

<p>"I say, Uncle, you're not going to let those beastly papers in,
are you?"</p>

<p>Soames gave him the sideway look which had reduced many to
silence in its time.</p>

<p>"In here," he said. "You needn't take off your furs,
Winifred."</p>

<p>Val entered behind them, nettled and with his head up. In this
confounded hole everybody&mdash;and there were a good many of
them&mdash;seemed sitting on everybody else's knee, though really
divided from each other by pews; and Val had a feeling that they
might all slip down together into the well. This, however, was but
a momentary vision&mdash;of mahogany, and black gowns, and white
blobs of wigs and faces and papers, all rather secret and
whispery&mdash;before he was sitting next his mother in the front
row, with his back to it all, glad of her violette de Parme, and
taking off his gloves for the last time. His mother was looking at
him; he was suddenly conscious that she had really wanted him there
next to her, and that he counted for something in this
business.</p>

<p>All right! He would show them! Squaring his shoulders, he
crossed his legs and gazed inscrutably at his spats. But just then
an 'old Johnny' in a gown and long wig, looking awfully like a
funny raddled woman, came through a door into the high pew
opposite, and he had to uncross his legs hastily, and stand up with
everybody else.</p>

<p>'Dartie versus Dartie!'</p>

<p>It seemed to Val unspeakably disgusting to have one's name
called out like this in public! And, suddenly conscious that
someone nearly behind him had begun talking about his family, he
screwed his face round to see an old be-wigged buffer, who spoke as
if he were eating his own words&mdash;queer-looking old cuss, the
sort of man he had seen once or twice dining at Park Lane and
punishing the port; he knew now where they 'dug them up.' All the
same he found the old buffer quite fascinating, and would have
continued to stare if his mother had not touched his arm. Reduced
to gazing before him, he fixed his eyes on the Judge's face
instead. Why should that old 'sportsman' with his sarcastic mouth
and his quick-moving eyes have the power to meddle with their
private affairs&mdash;hadn't he affairs of his own, just as many,
and probably just as nasty? And there moved in Val, like an
illness, all the deep-seated individualism of his breed. The voice
behind him droned along: "Differences about money
matters&mdash;extravagance of the respondent" (What a word! Was
that his father?)&mdash;"strained situation&mdash;frequent absences
on the part of Mr. Dartie. My client, very rightly, your Ludship
will agree, was anxious to check a course&mdash;but lead to
ruin&mdash;remonstrated&mdash;gambling at cards and on the
racecourse&mdash;" ('That's right!' thought Val, 'pile it on!')
"Crisis early in October, when the respondent wrote her this letter
from his Club." Val sat up and his ears burned. "I propose to read
it with the emendations necessary to the epistle of a gentleman who
has been&mdash;shall we say dining, me Lud?"</p>

<p>'Old brute!' thought Val, flushing deeper; 'you're not paid to
make jokes!'</p>

<p>"'You will not get the chance to insult me again in my own
house. I am leaving the country to-morrow. It's played
out'&mdash;an expression, your Ludship, not unknown in the mouths
of those who have not met with conspicuous success."</p>

<p>'Sniggering owls!' thought Val, and his flush deepened.</p>

<p>"'I am tired of being insulted by you.' My client will tell your
Ludship that these so-called insults consisted in her calling him
'the limit',&mdash;a very mild expression, I venture to suggest, in
all the circumstances."</p>

<p>Val glanced sideways at his mother's impassive face, it had a
hunted look in the eyes. 'Poor mother,' he thought, and touched her
arm with his own. The voice behind droned on.</p>

<p>"'I am going to live a new life. M. D.'"</p>

<p>"And next day, me Lud, the respondent left by the steamship
Tuscarora for Buenos Aires. Since then we have nothing from him but
a cabled refusal in answer to the letter which my client wrote the
following day in great distress, begging him to return to her. With
your Ludship's permission. I shall now put Mrs. Dartie in the
box."</p>

<p>When his mother rose, Val had a tremendous impulse to rise too
and say: 'Look here! I'm going to see you jolly well treat her
decently.' He subdued it, however; heard her saying, 'the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,' and looked up. She
made a rich figure of it, in her furs and large hat, with a slight
flush on her cheek-bones, calm, matter-of-fact; and he felt proud
of her thus confronting all these 'confounded lawyers.' The
examination began. Knowing that this was only the preliminary to
divorce, Val followed with a certain glee the questions framed so
as to give the impression that she really wanted his father back.
It seemed to him that they were 'foxing Old Bagwigs finely.'</p>

<p>And he received a most unpleasant jar when the Judge said
suddenly:</p>

<p>"Now, why did your husband leave you&mdash;not because you
called him 'the limit,' you know?"</p>

<p>Val saw his uncle lift his eyes to the witness box, without
moving his face; heard a shuffle of papers behind him; and instinct
told him that the issue was in peril. Had Uncle Soames and the old
buffer behind made a mess of it? His mother was speaking with a
slight drawl.</p>

<p>"No, my Lord, but it had gone on a long time."</p>

<p>"What had gone on?"</p>

<p>"Our differences about money."</p>

<p>"But you supplied the money. Do you suggest that he left you to
better his position?"</p>

<p>'The brute! The old brute, and nothing but the brute!' thought
Val suddenly. 'He smells a rat he's trying to get at the pastry!'
And his heart stood still. If&mdash;if he did, then, of course, he
would know that his mother didn't really want his father back. His
mother spoke again, a thought more fashionably.</p>

<p>"No, my Lord, but you see I had refused to give him any more
money. It took him a long time to believe that, but he did at
last&mdash;and when he did..."</p>

<p>"I see, you had refused. But you've sent him some since."</p>

<p>"My Lord, I wanted him back."</p>

<p>"And you thought that would bring him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, my Lord, I acted on my father's advice."</p>

<p>Something in the Judge's face, in the sound of the papers behind
him, in the sudden crossing of his uncle's legs, told Val that she
had made just the right answer. 'Crafty!' he thought; 'by Jove,
what humbug it all is!'</p>

<p>The Judge was speaking:</p>

<p>"Just one more question, Mrs. Dartie. Are you still fond of your
husband?"</p>

<p>Val's hands, slack behind him, became fists. What business had
that Judge to make things human suddenly? To make his mother speak
out of her heart, and say what, perhaps, she didn't know herself,
before all these people! It wasn't decent. His mother answered,
rather low: "Yes, my Lord." Val saw the Judge nod. 'Wish I could
take a cock-shy at your head!' he thought irreverently, as his
mother came back to her seat beside him. Witnesses to his father's
departure and continued absence followed&mdash;one of their own
maids even, which struck Val as particularly beastly; there was
more talking, all humbug; and then the Judge pronounced the decree
for restitution, and they got up to go. Val walked out behind his
mother, chin squared, eyelids drooped, doing his level best to
despise everybody. His mother's voice in the corridor roused him
from an angry trance.</p>

<p>"You behaved beautifully, dear. It was such a comfort to have
you. Your uncle and I are going to lunch."</p>

<p>"All right," said Val; "I shall have time to go and see that
fellow." And, parting from them abruptly, he ran down the stairs
and out into the air. He bolted into a hansom, and drove to the
Goat's Club. His thoughts were on Holly and what he must do before
her brother showed her this thing in to-morrow's paper.</p>

<hr>

<p>When Val had left them Soames and Winifred made their way to the
Cheshire Cheese. He had suggested it as a meeting place with Mr.
Bellby. At that early hour of noon they would have it to
themselves, and Winifred had thought it would be 'amusing' to see
this far-famed hostelry. Having ordered a light repast, to the
consternation of the waiter, they awaited its arrival together with
that of Mr. Bellby, in silent reaction after the hour and a half's
suspense on the tenterhooks of publicity. Mr. Bellby entered
presently, preceded by his nose, as cheerful as they were glum.
Well! they had got the decree of restitution, and what was the
matter with that!</p>

<p>"Quite," said Soames in a suitably low voice, "but we shall have
to begin again to get evidence. He'll probably try the
divorce&mdash;it will look fishy if it comes out that we knew of
misconduct from the start. His questions showed well enough that he
doesn't like this restitution dodge."</p>

<p>"Pho!" said Mr. Bellby cheerily, "he'll forget! Why, man, he'll
have tried a hundred cases between now and then. Besides, he's
bound by precedent to give ye your divorce, if the evidence is
satisfactory. We won't let um know that Mrs. Dartie had knowledge
of the facts. Dreamer did it very nicely&mdash;he's got a fatherly
touch about um!"</p>

<p>Soames nodded.</p>

<p>"And I compliment ye, Mrs. Dartie," went on Mr. Bellby; "ye've a
natural gift for giving evidence. Steady as a rock."</p>

<p>Here the waiter arrived with three plates balanced on one arm,
and the remark: "I 'urried up the pudden, sir. You'll find plenty
o' lark in it to-day."</p>

<p>Mr. Bellby applauded his forethought with a dip of his nose. But
Soames and Winifred looked with dismay at their light lunch of
gravified brown masses, touching them gingerly with their forks in
the hope of distinguishing the bodies of the tasty little
song-givers. Having begun, however, they found they were hungrier
than they thought, and finished the lot, with a glass of port
apiece. Conversation turned on the war. Soames thought Ladysmith
would fall, and it might last a year. Bellby thought it would be
over by the summer. Both agreed that they wanted more men. There
was nothing for it but complete victory, since it was now a
question of prestige. Winifred brought things back to more solid
ground by saying that she did not want the divorce suit to come on
till after the summer holidays had begun at Oxford, then the boys
would have forgotten about it before Val had to go up again; the
London season too would be over. The lawyers reassured her, an
interval of six months was necessary&mdash;after that the earlier
the better. People were now beginning to come in, and they
parted&mdash;Soames to the city, Bellby to his chambers, Winifred
in a hansom to Park Lane to let her mother know how she had fared.
The issue had been so satisfactory on the whole that it was
considered advisable to tell James, who never failed to say day
after day that he didn't know about Winifred's affair, he couldn't
tell. As his sands ran out; the importance of mundane matters
became increasingly grave to him, as if he were feeling: 'I must
make the most of it, and worry well; I shall soon have nothing to
worry about.'</p>

<p>He received the report grudgingly. It was a new-fangled way of
going about things, and he didn't know! But he gave Winifred a
cheque, saying:</p>

<p>"I expect you'll have a lot of expense. That's a new hat you've
got on. Why doesn't Val come and see us?"</p>

<p>Winifred promised to bring him to dinner soon. And, going home,
she sought her bedroom where she could be alone. Now that her
husband had been ordered back into her custody with a view to
putting him away from her for ever, she would try once more to find
out from her sore and lonely heart what she really wanted.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE CHALLENGE</h3>

<p>The morning had been misty, verging on frost, but the sun came
out while Val was jogging towards the Roehampton Gate, whence he
would canter on to the usual tryst. His spirits were rising
rapidly. There had been nothing so very terrible in the morning's
proceedings beyond the general disgrace of violated privacy. 'If we
were engaged!' he thought, 'what happens wouldn't matter.' He felt,
indeed, like human society, which kicks and clamours at the results
of matrimony, and hastens to get married. And he galloped over the
winter-dried grass of Richmond Park, fearing to be late. But again
he was alone at the trysting spot, and this second defection on the
part of Holly upset him dreadfully. He could not go back without
seeing her to-day! Emerging from the Park, he proceeded towards
Robin Hill. He could not make up his mind for whom to ask. Suppose
her father were back, or her sister or brother were in! He decided
to gamble, and ask for them all first, so that if he were in luck
and they were not there, it would be quite natural in the end to
ask for Holly; while if any of them were in&mdash;an 'excuse for a
ride' must be his saving grace.</p>

<p>"Only Miss Holly is in, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh! thanks. Might I take my horse round to the stables? And
would you say&mdash;her cousin, Mr. Val Dartie."</p>

<p>When he returned she was in the hall, very flushed and shy. She
led him to the far end, and they sat down on a wide
window-seat.</p>

<p>"I've been awfully anxious," said Val in a low voice. "What's
the matter?"</p>

<p>"Jolly knows about our riding."</p>

<p>"Is he in?"</p>

<p>"No; but I expect he will be soon."</p>

<p>"Then!" cried Val, and diving forward, he seized her hand. She
tried to withdraw it, failed, gave up the attempt, and looked at
him wistfully.</p>

<p>"First of all," he said, "I want to tell you something about my
family. My Dad, you know, isn't altogether&mdash;I mean, he's left
my mother and they're trying to divorce him; so they've ordered him
to come back, you see. You'll see that in the paper to-morrow."</p>

<p>Her eyes deepened in colour and fearful interest; her hand
squeezed his. But the gambler in Val was roused now, and he hurried
on:</p>

<p>"Of course there's nothing very much at present, but there will
be, I expect, before it's over; divorce suits are beastly, you
know. I wanted to tell you, because&mdash;because&mdash;you ought
to know&mdash;if&mdash;" and he began to stammer, gazing at her
troubled eyes, "if&mdash;if you're going to be a darling and love
me, Holly. I love you&mdash;ever so; and I want to be engaged." He
had done it in a manner so inadequate that he could have punched
his own head; and dropping on his knees, he tried to get nearer to
that soft, troubled face. "You do love me&mdash;don't you? If you
don't I..." There was a moment of silence and suspense, so awful
that he could hear the sound of a mowing-machine far out on the
lawn pretending there was grass to cut. Then she swayed forward;
her free hand touched his hair, and he gasped: "Oh, Holly!"</p>

<p>Her answer was very soft: "Oh, Val!"</p>

<p>He had dreamed of this moment, but always in an imperative mood,
as the masterful young lover, and now he felt humble, touched,
trembly. He was afraid to stir off his knees lest he should break
the spell; lest, if he did, she should shrink and deny her own
surrender&mdash;so tremulous was she in his grasp, with her eyelids
closed and his lips nearing them. Her eyes opened, seemed to swim a
little; he pressed his lips to hers. Suddenly he sprang up; there
had been footsteps, a sort of startled grunt. He looked round. No
one! But the long curtains which barred off the outer hall were
quivering.</p>

<p>"My God! Who was that?"</p>

<p>Holly too was on her feet.</p>

<p>"Jolly, I expect," she whispered.</p>

<p>Val clenched fists and resolution.</p>

<p>"All right!" he said, "I don't care a bit now we're engaged,"
and striding towards the curtains, he drew them aside. There at the
fireplace in the hall stood Jolly, with his back elaborately
turned. Val went forward. Jolly faced round on him.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for hearing," he said.</p>

<p>With the best intentions in the world, Val could not help
admiring him at that moment; his face was clear, his voice quiet,
he looked somehow distinguished, as if acting up to principle.</p>

<p>"Well!" Val said abruptly, "it's nothing to you."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Jolly; "you come this way," and he crossed the hall.
Val followed. At the study door he felt a touch on his arm; Holly's
voice said:</p>

<p>"I'm coming too."</p>

<p>"No," said Jolly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Holly.</p>

<p>Jolly opened the door, and they all three went in. Once in the
little room, they stood in a sort of triangle on three corners of
the worn Turkey carpet; awkwardly upright, not looking at each
other, quite incapable of seeing any humour in the situation.</p>

<p>Val broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Holly and I are engaged."</p>

<p>Jolly stepped back and leaned against the lintel of the
window.</p>

<p>"This is our house," he said; "I'm not going to insult you in
it. But my father's away. I'm in charge of my sister. You've taken
advantage of me.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to," said Val hotly.</p>

<p>"I think you did," said Jolly. "If you hadn't meant to, you'd
have spoken to me, or waited for my father to come back."</p>

<p>"There were reasons," said Val.</p>

<p>"What reasons?"</p>

<p>"About my family&mdash;I've just told her. I wanted her to know
before things happen."</p>

<p>Jolly suddenly became less distinguished.</p>

<p>"You're kids," he said, "and you know you are.</p>

<p>"I am not a kid," said Val.</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;you're not twenty."</p>

<p>"Well, what are you?"</p>

<p>"I am twenty," said Jolly.</p>

<p>"Only just; anyway, I'm as good a man as you."</p>

<p>Jolly's face crimsoned, then clouded. Some struggle was
evidently taking place in him; and Val and Holly stared at him, so
clearly was that struggle marked; they could even hear him
breathing. Then his face cleared up and became oddly resolute.</p>

<p>"We'll see that," he said. "I dare you to do what I'm going to
do."</p>

<p>"Dare me?"</p>

<p>Jolly smiled. "Yes," he said, "dare you; and I know very well
you won't."</p>

<p>A stab of misgiving shot through Val; this was riding very
blind.</p>

<p>"I haven't forgotten that you're a fire-eater," said Jolly
slowly, "and I think that's about all you are; or that you called
me a pro-Boer."</p>

<p>Val heard a gasp above the sound of his own hard breathing, and
saw Holly's face poked a little forward, very pale, with big
eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Jolly with a sort of smile, "we shall soon see.
I'm going to join the Imperial Yeomanry, and I dare you to do the
same, Mr. Val Dartie."</p>

<p>Val's head jerked on its stem. It was like a blow between the
eyes, so utterly unthought of, so extreme and ugly in the midst of
his dreaming; and he looked at Holly with eyes grown suddenly,
touchingly haggard.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" said Jolly. "Take your time! Think it over well."
And he himself sat down on the arm of his grandfather's chair.</p>

<p>Val did not sit down; he stood with hands thrust deep into his
breeches' pockets-hands clenched and quivering. The full awfulness
of this decision one way or the other knocked at his mind with
double knocks as of an angry postman. If he did not take that
'dare' he was disgraced in Holly's eyes, and in the eyes of that
young enemy, her brute of a brother. Yet if he took it, ah! then
all would vanish&mdash;her face, her eyes, her hair, her kisses
just begun!</p>

<p>"Take your time," said Jolly again; "I don't want to be
unfair."</p>

<p>And they both looked at Holly. She had recoiled against the
bookshelves reaching to the ceiling; her dark head leaned against
Gibbon's Roman Empire, her eyes in a sort of soft grey agony were
fixed on Val. And he, who had not much gift of insight, had
suddenly a gleam of vision. She would be proud of her
brother&mdash;that enemy! She would be ashamed of him! His hands
came out of his pockets as if lifted by a spring.</p>

<p>"All right!" he said. "Done!"</p>

<p>Holly's face&mdash;oh! it was queer! He saw her flush, start
forward. He had done the right thing&mdash;her face was shining
with wistful admiration. Jolly stood up and made a little bow as
who should say: 'You've passed.'</p>

<p>"To-morrow, then," he said, "we'll go together."</p>

<p>Recovering from the impetus which had carried him to that
decision, Val looked at him maliciously from under his lashes. 'All
right,' he thought, 'one to you. I shall have to join&mdash;but
I'll get back on you somehow.' And he said with dignity: "I shall
be ready."</p>

<p>"We'll meet at the main Recruiting Office, then," said Jolly,
"at twelve o'clock." And, opening the window, he went out on to the
terrace, conforming to the creed which had made him retire when he
surprised them in the hall.</p>

<p>The confusion in the mind of Val thus left alone with her for
whom he had paid this sudden price was extreme. The mood of
'showing-off' was still, however, uppermost. One must do the
wretched thing with an air.</p>

<p>"We shall get plenty of riding and shooting, anyway," he said;
"that's one comfort." And it gave him a sort of grim pleasure to
hear the sigh which seemed to come from the bottom of her
heart.</p>

<p>"Oh! the war'll soon be over," he said; "perhaps we shan't even
have to go out. I don't care, except for you." He would be out of
the way of that beastly divorce. It was an ill-wind! He felt her
warm hand slip into his. Jolly thought he had stopped their loving
each other, did he? He held her tightly round the waist, looking at
her softly through his lashes, smiling to cheer her up, promising
to come down and see her soon, feeling somehow six inches taller
and much more in command of her than he had ever dared feel before.
Many times he kissed her before he mounted and rode back to town.
So, swiftly, on the least provocation, does the possessive instinct
flourish and grow.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX&mdash;DINNER AT JAMES'</h3>

<p>Dinner parties were not now given at James' in Park
Lane&mdash;to every house the moment comes when Master or Mistress
is no longer 'up to it'; no more can nine courses be served to
twenty mouths above twenty fine white expanses; nor does the
household cat any longer wonder why she is suddenly shut up.</p>

<p>So with something like excitement Emily&mdash;who at seventy
would still have liked a little feast and fashion now and
then&mdash;ordered dinner for six instead of two, herself wrote a
number of foreign words on cards, and arranged the
flowers&mdash;mimosa from the Riviera, and white Roman hyacinths
not from Rome. There would only be, of course, James and herself,
Soames, Winifred, Val, and Imogen&mdash;but she liked to pretend a
little and dally in imagination with the glory of the past. She so
dressed herself that James remarked:</p>

<p>"What are you putting on that thing for? You'll catch cold."</p>

<p>But Emily knew that the necks of women are protected by love of
shining, unto fourscore years, and she only answered:</p>

<p>"Let me put you on one of those dickies I got you, James; then
you'll only have to change your trousers, and put on your velvet
coat, and there you'll be. Val likes you to look nice."</p>

<p>"Dicky!" said James. "You're always wasting your money on
something."</p>

<p>But he suffered the change to be made till his neck also shone,
murmuring vaguely:</p>

<p>"He's an extravagant chap, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>A little brighter in the eye, with rather more colour than usual
in his cheeks, he took his seat in the drawing-room to wait for the
sound of the front-door bell.</p>

<p>"I've made it a proper dinner party," Emily said comfortably; "I
thought it would be good practice for Imogen&mdash;she must get
used to it now she's coming out."</p>

<p>James uttered an indeterminate sound, thinking of Imogen as she
used to climb about his knee or pull Christmas crackers with
him.</p>

<p>"She'll be pretty," he muttered, "I shouldn't wonder."</p>

<p>"She is pretty," said Emily; "she ought to make a good
match."</p>

<p>"There you go," murmured James; "she'd much better stay at home
and look after her mother." A second Dartie carrying off his pretty
granddaughter would finish him! He had never quite forgiven Emily
for having been as much taken in by Montague Dartie as he himself
had been.</p>

<p>"Where's Warmson?" he said suddenly. "I should like a glass of
Madeira to-night."</p>

<p>"There's champagne, James."</p>

<p>James shook his head. "No body," he said; "I can't get any good
out of it."</p>

<p>Emily reached forward on her side of the fire and rang the
bell.</p>

<p>"Your master would like a bottle of Madeira opened,
Warmson."</p>

<p>"No, no!" said James, the tips of his ears quivering with
vehemence, and his eyes fixed on an object seen by him alone. "Look
here, Warmson, you go to the inner cellar, and on the middle shelf
of the end bin on the left you'll see seven bottles; take the one
in the centre, and don't shake it. It's the last of the Madeira I
had from Mr. Jolyon when we came in here&mdash;never been moved; it
ought to be in prime condition still; but I don't know, I can't
tell."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," responded the withdrawing Warmson.</p>

<p>"I was keeping it for our golden wedding," said James suddenly,
"but I shan't live three years at my age."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, James," said Emily, "don't talk like that."</p>

<p>"I ought to have got it up myself," murmured James, "he'll shake
it as likely as not." And he sank into silent recollection of long
moments among the open gas-jets, the cobwebs and the good smell of
wine-soaked corks, which had been appetiser to so many feasts. In
the wine from that cellar was written the history of the forty odd
years since he had come to the Park Lane house with his young
bride, and of the many generations of friends and acquaintances who
had passed into the unknown; its depleted bins preserved the record
of family festivity&mdash;all the marriages, births, deaths of his
kith and kin. And when he was gone there it would be, and he didn't
know what would become of it. It'd be drunk or spoiled, he
shouldn't wonder!</p>

<p>From that deep reverie the entrance of his son dragged him,
followed very soon by that of Winifred and her two eldest.</p>

<p>They went down arm-in-arm&mdash;James with Imogen, the
debutante, because his pretty grandchild cheered him; Soames with
Winifred; Emily with Val, whose eyes lighting on the oysters
brightened. This was to be a proper full 'blowout' with 'fizz' and
port! And he felt in need of it, after what he had done that day,
as yet undivulged. After the first glass or two it became pleasant
to have this bombshell up his sleeve, this piece of sensational
patriotism, or example, rather, of personal daring, to
display&mdash;for his pleasure in what he had done for his Queen
and Country was so far entirely personal. He was now a 'blood,'
indissolubly connected with guns and horses; he had a right to
swagger&mdash;not, of course, that he was going to. He should just
announce it quietly, when there was a pause. And, glancing down the
menu, he determined on 'Bombe aux fraises' as the proper moment;
there would be a certain solemnity while they were eating that.
Once or twice before they reached that rosy summit of the dinner he
was attacked by remembrance that his grandfather was never told
anything! Still, the old boy was drinking Madeira, and looking
jolly fit! Besides, he ought to be pleased at this set-off to the
disgrace of the divorce. The sight of his uncle opposite, too, was
a sharp incentive. He was so far from being a sportsman that it
would be worth a lot to see his face. Besides, better to tell his
mother in this way than privately, which might upset them both! He
was sorry for her, but after all one couldn't be expected to feel
much for others when one had to part from Holly.</p>

<p>His grandfather's voice travelled to him thinly. "Val, try a
little of the Madeira with your ice. You won't get that up at
college."</p>

<p>Val watched the slow liquid filling his glass, the essential oil
of the old wine glazing the surface; inhaled its aroma, and
thought: 'Now for it!' It was a rich moment. He sipped, and a
gentle glow spread in his veins, already heated. With a rapid look
round, he said, "I joined the Imperial Yeomanry to-day, Granny,"
and emptied his glass as though drinking the health of his own
act.</p>

<p>"What!" It was his mother's desolate little word.</p>

<p>"Young Jolly Forsyte and I went down there together."</p>

<p>"You didn't sign?" from Uncle Soames.</p>

<p>"Rather! We go into camp on Monday."</p>

<p>"I say!" cried Imogen.</p>

<p>All looked at James. He was leaning forward with his hand behind
his ear.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he said. "What's he saying? I can't hear."</p>

<p>Emily reached forward to pat Val's hand.</p>

<p>"It's only that Val has joined the Yeomanry, James; it's very
nice for him. He'll look his best in uniform."</p>

<p>"Joined the&mdash;rubbish!" came from James, tremulously loud.
"You can't see two yards before your nose. He&mdash;he'll have to
go out there. Why! he'll be fighting before he knows where he
is."</p>

<p>Val saw Imogen's eyes admiring him, and his mother still and
fashionable with her handkerchief before her lips.</p>

<p>Suddenly his uncle spoke.</p>

<p>"You're under age."</p>

<p>"I thought of that," smiled Val; "I gave my age as
twenty-one."</p>

<p>He heard his grandmother's admiring, "Well, Val, that was plucky
of you;" was conscious of Warmson deferentially filling his
champagne glass; and of his grandfather's voice moaning: "I don't
know what'll become of you if you go on like this."</p>

<p>Imogen was patting his shoulder, his uncle looking at him
sidelong; only his mother sat unmoving, till, affected by her
stillness, Val said:</p>

<p>"It's all right, you know; we shall soon have them on the run. I
only hope I shall come in for something."</p>

<p>He felt elated, sorry, tremendously important all at once. This
would show Uncle Soames, and all the Forsytes, how to be sportsmen.
He had certainly done something heroic and exceptional in giving
his age as twenty-one.</p>

<p>Emily's voice brought him back to earth.</p>

<p>"You mustn't have a second glass, James. Warmson!"</p>

<p>"Won't they be astonished at Timothy's!" burst out Imogen. "I'd
give anything to see their faces. Do you have a sword, Val, or only
a popgun?"</p>

<p>"What made you?"</p>

<p>His uncle's voice produced a slight chill in the pit of Val's
stomach. Made him? How answer that? He was grateful for his
grandmother's comfortable:</p>

<p>"Well, I think it's very plucky of Val. I'm sure he'll make a
splendid soldier; he's just the figure for it. We shall all be
proud of him."</p>

<p>"What had young Jolly Forsyte to do with it? Why did you go
together?" pursued Soames, uncannily relentless. "I thought you
weren't friendly with him?"</p>

<p>"I'm not," mumbled Val, "but I wasn't going to be beaten by
him." He saw his uncle look at him quite differently, as if
approving. His grandfather was nodding too, his grandmother tossing
her head. They all approved of his not being beaten by that cousin
of his. There must be a reason! Val was dimly conscious of some
disturbing point outside his range of vision; as it might be, the
unlocated centre of a cyclone. And, staring at his uncle's face, he
had a quite unaccountable vision of a woman with dark eyes, gold
hair, and a white neck, who smelt nice, and had pretty silken
clothes which he had liked feeling when he was quite small. By
Jove, yes! Aunt Irene! She used to kiss him, and he had bitten her
arm once, playfully, because he liked it&mdash;so soft. His
grandfather was speaking:</p>

<p>"What's his father doing?"</p>

<p>"He's away in Paris," Val said, staring at the very queer
expression on his uncle's face, like&mdash;like that of a snarling
dog.</p>

<p>"Artists!" said James. The word coming from the very bottom of
his soul, broke up the dinner.</p>

<p>Opposite his mother in the cab going home, Val tasted the
after-fruits of heroism, like medlars over-ripe.</p>

<p>She only said, indeed, that he must go to his tailor's at once
and have his uniform properly made, and not just put up with what
they gave him. But he could feel that she was very much upset. It
was on his lips to console her with the spoken thought that he
would be out of the way of that beastly divorce, but the presence
of Imogen, and the knowledge that his mother would not be out of
the way, restrained him. He felt aggrieved that she did not seem
more proud of him. When Imogen had gone to bed, he risked the
emotional.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry to have to leave you, Mother."</p>

<p>"Well, I must make the best of it. We must try and get you a
commission as soon as we can; then you won't have to rough it so.
Do you know any drill, Val?"</p>

<p>"Not a scrap."</p>

<p>"I hope they won't worry you much. I must take you about to get
the things to-morrow. Good-night; kiss me."</p>

<p>With that kiss, soft and hot, between his eyes, and those words,
'I hope they won't worry you much,' in his ears, he sat down to a
cigarette, before a dying fire. The heat was out of him&mdash;the
glow of cutting a dash. It was all a damned heart-aching bore.
'I'll be even with that chap Jolly,' he thought, trailing up the
stairs, past the room where his mother was biting her pillow to
smother a sense of desolation which was trying to make her sob.</p>

<p>And soon only one of the diners at James' was
awake&mdash;Soames, in his bedroom above his father's.</p>

<p>So that fellow Jolyon was in Paris&mdash;what was he doing
there? Hanging round Irene! The last report from Polteed had hinted
that there might be something soon. Could it be this? That fellow,
with his beard and his cursed amused way of speaking&mdash;son of
the old man who had given him the nickname 'Man of Property,' and
bought the fatal house from him. Soames had ever resented having
had to sell the house at Robin Hill; never forgiven his uncle for
having bought it, or his cousin for living in it.</p>

<p>Reckless of the cold, he threw his window up and gazed out
across the Park. Bleak and dark the January night; little sound of
traffic; a frost coming; bare trees; a star or two. 'I'll see
Polteed to-morrow,' he thought. 'By God! I'm mad, I think, to want
her still. That fellow! If...? Um! No!'</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER X&mdash;DEATH OF THE DOG BALTHASAR</h3>

<p>Jolyon, who had crossed from Calais by night, arrived at Robin
Hill on Sunday morning. He had sent no word beforehand, so walked
up from the station, entering his domain by the coppice gate.
Coming to the log seat fashioned out of an old fallen trunk, he sat
down, first laying his overcoat on it.</p>

<p>'Lumbago!' he thought; 'that's what love ends in at my time of
life!' And suddenly Irene seemed very near, just as she had been
that day of rambling at Fontainebleau when they had sat on a log to
eat their lunch. Hauntingly near! Odour drawn out of fallen leaves
by the pale-filtering sunlight soaked his nostrils. 'I'm glad it
isn't spring,' he thought. With the scent of sap, and the song of
birds, and the bursting of the blossoms, it would have been
unbearable! 'I hope I shall be over it by then, old fool that I
am!' and picking up his coat, he walked on into the field. He
passed the pond and mounted the hill slowly.</p>

<p>Near the top a hoarse barking greeted him. Up on the lawn above
the fernery he could see his old dog Balthasar. The animal, whose
dim eyes took his master for a stranger, was warning the world
against him. Jolyon gave his special whistle. Even at that distance
of a hundred yards and more he could see the dawning recognition in
the obese brown-white body. The old dog got off his haunches, and
his tail, close-curled over his back, began a feeble, excited
fluttering; he came waddling forward, gathered momentum, and
disappeared over the edge of the fernery. Jolyon expected to meet
him at the wicket gate, but Balthasar was not there, and, rather
alarmed, he turned into the fernery. On his fat side, looking up
with eyes already glazing, the old dog lay.</p>

<p>"What is it, my poor old man?" cried Jolyon. Balthasar's curled
and fluffy tail just moved; his filming eyes seemed saying: "I
can't get up, master, but I'm glad to see you."</p>

<p>Jolyon knelt down; his eyes, very dimmed, could hardly see the
slowly ceasing heave of the dog's side. He raised the head a
little&mdash;very heavy.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear man? Where are you hurt?" The tail fluttered
once; the eyes lost the look of life. Jolyon passed his hands all
over the inert warm bulk. There was nothing&mdash;the heart had
simply failed in that obese body from the emotion of his master's
return. Jolyon could feel the muzzle, where a few whitish bristles
grew, cooling already against his lips. He stayed for some minutes
kneeling; with his hand beneath the stiffening head. The body was
very heavy when he bore it to the top of the field; leaves had
drifted there, and he strewed it with a covering of them; there was
no wind, and they would keep him from curious eyes until the
afternoon. 'I'll bury him myself,' he thought. Eighteen years had
gone since he first went into the St. John's Wood house with that
tiny puppy in his pocket. Strange that the old dog should die just
now! Was it an omen? He turned at the gate to look back at that
russet mound, then went slowly towards the house, very choky in the
throat.</p>

<p>June was at home; she had come down hotfoot on hearing the news
of Jolly's enlistment. His patriotism had conquered her feeling for
the Boers. The atmosphere of his house was strange and pocketty
when Jolyon came in and told them of the dog Balthasar's death. The
news had a unifying effect. A link with the past had
snapped&mdash;the dog Balthasar! Two of them could remember nothing
before his day; to June he represented the last years of her
grandfather; to Jolyon that life of domestic stress and aesthetic
struggle before he came again into the kingdom of his father's love
and wealth! And he was gone!</p>

<p>In the afternoon he and Jolly took picks and spades and went out
to the field. They chose a spot close to the russet mound, so that
they need not carry him far, and, carefully cutting off the surface
turf, began to dig. They dug in silence for ten minutes, and then
rested.</p>

<p>"Well, old man," said Jolyon, "so you thought you ought?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Jolly; "I don't want to a bit, of course."</p>

<p>How exactly those words represented Jolyon's own state of
mind</p>

<p>"I admire you for it, old boy. I don't believe I should have
done it at your age&mdash;too much of a Forsyte, I'm afraid. But I
suppose the type gets thinner with each generation. Your son, if
you have one, may be a pure altruist; who knows?"</p>

<p>"He won't be like me, then, Dad; I'm beastly selfish."</p>

<p>"No, my dear, that you clearly are not." Jolly shook his head,
and they dug again.</p>

<p>"Strange life a dog's," said Jolyon suddenly: "The only
four-footer with rudiments of altruism and a sense of God!"</p>

<p>Jolly looked at his father.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in God, Dad? I've never known."</p>

<p>At so searching a question from one to whom it was impossible to
make a light reply, Jolyon stood for a moment feeling his back
tried by the digging.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by God?" he said; "there are two
irreconcilable ideas of God. There's the Unknowable Creative
Principle&mdash;one believes in That. And there's the Sum of
altruism in man&mdash;naturally one believes in That."</p>

<p>"I see. That leaves out Christ, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>Jolyon stared. Christ, the link between those two ideas! Out of
the mouth of babes! Here was orthodoxy scientifically explained at
last! The sublime poem of the Christ life was man's attempt to join
those two irreconcilable conceptions of God. And since the Sum of
human altruism was as much a part of the Unknowable Creative
Principle as anything else in Nature and the Universe, a worse link
might have been chosen after all! Funny&mdash;how one went through
life without seeing it in that sort of way!</p>

<p>"What do you think, old man?" he said.</p>

<p>Jolly frowned. "Of course, my first year we talked a good bit
about that sort of thing. But in the second year one gives it up; I
don't know why&mdash;it's awfully interesting."</p>

<p>Jolyon remembered that he also had talked a good deal about it
his first year at Cambridge, and given it up in his second.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Jolly, "it's the second God, you mean, that
old Balthasar had a sense of."</p>

<p>"Yes, or he would never have burst his poor old heart because of
something outside himself."</p>

<p>"But wasn't that just selfish emotion, really?"</p>

<p>Jolyon shook his head. "No, dogs are not pure Forsytes, they
love something outside themselves."</p>

<p>Jolly smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, I think I'm one," he said. "You know, I only enlisted
because I dared Val Dartie to."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"We bar each other," said Jolly shortly.</p>

<p>"Ah!" muttered Jolyon. So the feud went on, unto the third
generation&mdash;this modern feud which had no overt
expression?</p>

<p>'Shall I tell the boy about it?' he thought. But to what
end&mdash;if he had to stop short of his own part?</p>

<p>And Jolly thought: 'It's for Holly to let him know about that
chap. If she doesn't, it means she doesn't want him told, and I
should be sneaking. Anyway, I've stopped it. I'd better leave well
alone!'</p>

<p>So they dug on in silence, till Jolyon said:</p>

<p>"Now, old man, I think it's big enough." And, resting on their
spades, they gazed down into the hole where a few leaves had
drifted already on a sunset wind.</p>

<p>"I can't bear this part of it," said Jolyon suddenly.</p>

<p>"Let me do it, Dad. He never cared much for me."</p>

<p>Jolyon shook his head.</p>

<p>"We'll lift him very gently, leaves and all. I'd rather not see
him again. I'll take his head. Now!"</p>

<p>With extreme care they raised the old dog's body, whose faded
tan and white showed here and there under the leaves stirred by the
wind. They laid it, heavy, cold, and unresponsive, in the grave,
and Jolly spread more leaves over it, while Jolyon, deeply afraid
to show emotion before his son, began quickly shovelling the earth
on to that still shape. There went the past! If only there were a
joyful future to look forward to! It was like stamping down earth
on one's own life. They replaced the turf carefully on the smooth
little mound, and, grateful that they had spared each other's
feelings, returned to the house arm-in-arm.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI&mdash;TIMOTHY STAYS THE ROT</h3>

<p>On Forsyte 'Change news of the enlistment spread fast, together
with the report that June, not to be outdone, was going to become a
Red Cross nurse. These events were so extreme, so subversive of
pure Forsyteism, as to have a binding effect upon the family, and
Timothy's was thronged next Sunday afternoon by members trying to
find out what they thought about it all, and exchange with each
other a sense of family credit. Giles and Jesse Hayman would no
longer defend the coast but go to South Africa quite soon; Jolly
and Val would be following in April; as to June&mdash;well, you
never knew what she would really do.</p>

<p>The retirement from Spion Kop and the absence of any good news
from the seat of war imparted an air of reality to all this,
clinched in startling fashion by Timothy. The youngest of the old
Forsytes&mdash;scarcely eighty, in fact popularly supposed to
resemble their father, 'Superior Dosset,' even in his best-known
characteristic of drinking Sherry&mdash;had been invisible for so
many years that he was almost mythical. A long generation had
elapsed since the risks of a publisher's business had worked on his
nerves at the age of forty, so that he had got out with a mere
thirty-five thousand pounds in the world, and started to make his
living by careful investment. Putting by every year, at compound
interest, he had doubled his capital in forty years without having
once known what it was like to shake in his shoes over money
matters. He was now putting aside some two thousand a year, and,
with the care he was taking of himself, expected, so Aunt Hester
said, to double his capital again before he died. What he would do
with it then, with his sisters dead and himself dead, was often
mockingly queried by free spirits such as Francie, Euphemia, or
young Nicholas' second, Christopher, whose spirit was so free that
he had actually said he was going on the stage. All admitted,
however, that this was best known to Timothy himself, and possibly
to Soames, who never divulged a secret.</p>

<p>Those few Forsytes who had seen him reported a man of thick and
robust appearance, not very tall, with a brown-red complexion, grey
hair, and little of the refinement of feature with which most of
the Forsytes had been endowed by 'Superior Dosset's' wife, a woman
of some beauty and a gentle temperament. It was known that he had
taken surprising interest in the war, sticking flags into a map
ever since it began, and there was uneasiness as to what would
happen if the English were driven into the sea, when it would be
almost impossible for him to put the flags in the right places. As
to his knowledge of family movements or his views about them,
little was known, save that Aunt Hester was always declaring that
he was very upset. It was, then, in the nature of a portent when
Forsytes, arriving on the Sunday after the evacuation of Spion Kop,
became conscious, one after the other, of a presence seated in the
only really comfortable armchair, back to the light, concealing the
lower part of his face with a large hand, and were greeted by the
awed voice of Aunt Hester:</p>

<p>"Your Uncle Timothy, my dear."</p>

<p>Timothy's greeting to them all was somewhat identical; and
rather, as it were, passed over by him than expressed:</p>

<p>"How de do? How de do? 'Xcuse me gettin' up!"</p>

<p>Francie was present, and Eustace had come in his car; Winifred
had brought Imogen, breaking the ice of the restitution proceedings
with the warmth of family appreciation at Val's enlistment; and
Marian Tweetyman with the last news of Giles and Jesse. These with
Aunt Juley and Hester, young Nicholas, Euphemia, and&mdash;of all
people!&mdash;George, who had come with Eustace in the car,
constituted an assembly worthy of the family's palmiest days. There
was not one chair vacant in the whole of the little drawing-room,
and anxiety was felt lest someone else should arrive.</p>

<p>The constraint caused by Timothy's presence having worn off a
little, conversation took a military turn. George asked Aunt Juley
when she was going out with the Red Cross, almost reducing her to a
state of gaiety; whereon he turned to Nicholas and said:</p>

<p>"Young Nick's a warrior bold, isn't he? When's he going to don
the wild khaki?"</p>

<p>Young Nicholas, smiling with a sort of sweet deprecation,
intimated that of course his mother was very anxious.</p>

<p>"The Dromios are off, I hear," said George, turning to Marian
Tweetyman; "we shall all be there soon. En avant, the Forsytes!
Roll, bowl, or pitch! Who's for a cooler?"</p>

<p>Aunt Juley gurgled, George was so droll! Should Hester get
Timothy's map? Then he could show them all where they were.</p>

<p>At a sound from Timothy, interpreted as assent, Aunt Hester left
the room.</p>

<p>George pursued his image of the Forsyte advance, addressing
Timothy as Field Marshal; and Imogen, whom he had noted at once for
'a pretty filly,'&mdash;as Vivandiere; and holding his top hat
between his knees, he began to beat it with imaginary drumsticks.
The reception accorded to his fantasy was mixed. All
laughed&mdash;George was licensed; but all felt that the family was
being 'rotted'; and this seemed to them unnatural, now that it was
going to give five of its members to the service of the Queen.
George might go too far; and there was relief when he got up,
offered his arm to Aunt Juley, marched up to Timothy, saluted him,
kissed his aunt with mock passion, said, "Oh! what a treat, dear
papa! Come on, Eustace!" and walked out, followed by the grave and
fastidious Eustace, who had never smiled.</p>

<p>Aunt Juley's bewildered, "Fancy not waiting for the map! You
mustn't mind him, Timothy. He's so droll!" broke the hush, and
Timothy removed the hand from his mouth.</p>

<p>"I don't know what things are comin' to," he was heard to say.
"What's all this about goin' out there? That's not the way to beat
those Boers."</p>

<p>Francie alone had the hardihood to observe: "What is, then,
Uncle Timothy?"</p>

<p>"All this new-fangled volunteerin' and expense&mdash;lettin'
money out of the country."</p>

<p>Just then Aunt Hester brought in the map, handling it like a
baby with eruptions. With the assistance of Euphemia it was laid on
the piano, a small Colwood grand, last played on, it was believed,
the summer before Aunt Ann died, thirteen years ago. Timothy rose.
He walked over to the piano, and stood looking at his map while
they all gathered round.</p>

<p>"There you are," he said; "that's the position up to date; and
very poor it is. H'm!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Francie, greatly daring, "but how are you going to
alter it, Uncle Timothy, without more men?"</p>

<p>"Men!" said Timothy; "you don't want men&mdash;wastin' the
country's money. You want a Napoleon, he'd settle it in a
month."</p>

<p>"But if you haven't got him, Uncle Timothy?"</p>

<p>"That's their business," replied Timothy. "What have we kept the
Army up for&mdash;to eat their heads off in time of peace! They
ought to be ashamed of themselves, comin' on the country to help
them like this! Let every man stick to his business, and we shall
get on."</p>

<p>And looking round him, he added almost angrily:</p>

<p>"Volunteerin', indeed! Throwin' good money after bad! We must
save! Conserve energy that's the only way." And with a prolonged
sound, not quite a sniff and not quite a snort, he trod on
Euphemia's toe, and went out, leaving a sensation and a faint scent
of barley-sugar behind him.</p>

<p>The effect of something said with conviction by one who has
evidently made a sacrifice to say it is ever considerable. And the
eight Forsytes left behind, all women except young Nicholas, were
silent for a moment round the map. Then Francie said:</p>

<p>"Really, I think he's right, you know. After all, what is the
Army for? They ought to have known. It's only encouraging
them."</p>

<p>"My dear!" cried Aunt Juley, "but they've been so progressive.
Think of their giving up their scarlet. They were always so proud
of it. And now they all look like convicts. Hester and I were
saying only yesterday we were sure they must feel it very much.
Fancy what the Iron Duke would have said!"</p>

<p>"The new colour's very smart," said Winifred; "Val looks quite
nice in his."</p>

<p>Aunt Juley sighed.</p>

<p>"I do so wonder what Jolyon's boy is like. To think we've never
seen him! His father must be so proud of him."</p>

<p>"His father's in Paris," said Winifred.</p>

<p>Aunt Hester's shoulder was seen to mount suddenly, as if to ward
off her sister's next remark, for Juley's crumpled cheeks had
gushed.</p>

<p>"We had dear little Mrs. MacAnder here yesterday, just back from
Paris. And whom d'you think she saw there in the street? You'll
never guess."</p>

<p>"We shan't try, Auntie," said Euphemia.</p>

<p>"Irene! Imagine! After all this time; walking with a fair
beard..."</p>

<p>"Auntie! you'll kill me! A fair beard..."</p>

<p>"I was going to say," said Aunt Juley severely, "a fair-bearded
gentleman. And not a day older; she was always so pretty," she
added, with a sort of lingering apology.</p>

<p>"Oh! tell us about her, Auntie," cried Imogen; "I can just
remember her. She's the skeleton in the family cupboard, isn't she?
And they're such fun."</p>

<p>Aunt Hester sat down. Really, Juley had done it now!</p>

<p>"She wasn't much of a skeleton as I remember her," murmured
Euphemia, "extremely well-covered."</p>

<p>"My dear!" said Aunt Juley, "what a peculiar way of putting
it&mdash;not very nice."</p>

<p>"No, but what was she like?" persisted Imogen.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, my child," said Francie; "a kind of modern
Venus, very well-dressed."</p>

<p>Euphemia said sharply: "Venus was never dressed, and she had
blue eyes of melting sapphire."</p>

<p>At this juncture Nicholas took his leave.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Nick is awfully strict," said Francie with a laugh.</p>

<p>"She has six children," said Aunt Juley; "it's very proper she
should be careful."</p>

<p>"Was Uncle Soames awfully fond of her?" pursued the inexorable
Imogen, moving her dark luscious eyes from face to face.</p>

<p>Aunt Hester made a gesture of despair, just as Aunt Juley
answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, your Uncle Soames was very much attached to her."</p>

<p>"I suppose she ran off with someone?"</p>

<p>"No, certainly not; that is&mdash;not precisely.'</p>

<p>"What did she do, then, Auntie?"</p>

<p>"Come along, Imogen," said Winifred, "we must be getting
back."</p>

<p>But Aunt Juley interjected resolutely: "She&mdash;she didn't
behave at all well."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother!" cried Imogen; "that's as far as I ever get."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," said Francie, "she had a love affair which
ended with the young man's death; and then she left your uncle. I
always rather liked her."</p>

<p>"She used to give me chocolates," murmured Imogen, "and smell
nice."</p>

<p>"Of course!" remarked Euphemia.</p>

<p>"Not of course at all!" replied Francie, who used a particularly
expensive essence of gillyflower herself.</p>

<p>"I can't think what we are about," said Aunt Juley, raising her
hands, "talking of such things!"</p>

<p>"Was she divorced?" asked Imogen from the door.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," cried Aunt Juley; "that is&mdash;certainly
not."</p>

<p>A sound was heard over by the far door. Timothy had re-entered
the back drawing-room. "I've come for my map," he said. "Who's been
divorced?"</p>

<p>"No one, Uncle," replied Francie with perfect truth.</p>

<p>Timothy took his map off the piano.</p>

<p>"Don't let's have anything of that sort in the family," he said.
"All this enlistin's bad enough. The country's breakin' up; I don't
know what we're comin' to." He shook a thick finger at the room:
"Too many women nowadays, and they don't know what they want."</p>

<p>So saying, he grasped the map firmly with both hands, and went
out as if afraid of being answered.</p>

<p>The seven women whom he had addressed broke into a subdued
murmur, out of which emerged Francie's, "Really, the Forsytes!" and
Aunt Juley's: "He must have his feet in mustard and hot water
to-night, Hester; will you tell Jane? The blood has gone to his
head again, I'm afraid..."</p>

<p>That evening, when she and Hester were sitting alone after
dinner, she dropped a stitch in her crochet, and looked up:</p>

<p>"Hester, I can't think where I've heard that dear Soames wants
Irene to come back to him again. Who was it told us that George had
made a funny drawing of him with the words, 'He won't be happy till
he gets it'?"</p>

<p>"Eustace," answered Aunt Hester from behind The Times; "he had
it in his pocket, but he wouldn't show it us."</p>

<p>Aunt Juley was silent, ruminating. The clock ticked, The Times
crackled, the fire sent forth its rustling purr. Aunt Juley dropped
another stitch.</p>

<p>"Hester," she said, "I have had such a dreadful thought."</p>

<p>"Then don't tell me," said Aunt Hester quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh! but I must. You can't think how dreadful!" Her voice sank
to a whisper:</p>

<p>"Jolyon&mdash;Jolyon, they say, has a&mdash;has a fair beard,
now."</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER XII&mdash;PROGRESS OF THE CHASE</h3>

<p>Two days after the dinner at James', Mr. Polteed provided Soames
with food for thought.</p>

<p>"A gentleman," he said, consulting the key concealed in his left
hand, "47 as we say, has been paying marked attention to 17 during
the last month in Paris. But at present there seems to have been
nothing very conclusive. The meetings have all been in public
places, without concealment&mdash;restaurants, the Opera, the
Comique, the Louvre, Luxembourg Gardens, lounge of the hotel, and
so forth. She has not yet been traced to his rooms, nor vice versa.
They went to Fontainebleau&mdash;but nothing of value. In short,
the situation is promising, but requires patience." And, looking up
suddenly, he added:</p>

<p>"One rather curious point&mdash;47 has the same name
as&mdash;er&mdash;31!"</p>

<p>'The fellow knows I'm her husband,' thought Soames.</p>

<p>"Christian name&mdash;an odd one&mdash;Jolyon," continued Mr.
Polteed. "We know his address in Paris and his residence here. We
don't wish, of course, to be running a wrong hare."</p>

<p>"Go on with it, but be careful," said Soames doggedly.</p>

<p>Instinctive certainty that this detective fellow had fathomed
his secret made him all the more reticent.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Mr. Polteed, "I'll just see if there's
anything fresh in."</p>

<p>He returned with some letters. Relocking the door, he glanced at
the envelopes.</p>

<p>"Yes, here's a personal one from 19 to myself."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Soames.</p>

<pre>
 "Um!" said Mr. Polteed, "she says: '47 left for England to-day.
Address on his baggage: Robin Hill. Parted from 17 in Louvre Gallery
at 3.30; nothing very striking. Thought it best to stay and continue
observation of 17. You will deal with 47 in England if you think
desirable, no doubt.'" And Mr. Polteed lifted an unprofessional glance
on Soames, as though he might be storing material for a book on human
nature after he had gone out of business. "Very intelligent woman, 19,
and a wonderful make-up. Not cheap, but earns her money well. There's
no suspicion of being shadowed so far. But after a time, as you know,
sensitive people are liable to get the feeling of it, without anything
definite to go on. I should rather advise letting-up on 17, and keeping
an eye on 47. We can't get at correspondence without great risk. I
hardly advise that at this stage. But you can tell your client that
it's looking up very well." And again his narrowed eyes gleamed at his
taciturn customer.
</pre>

<p>"No," said Soames suddenly, "I prefer that you should keep the
watch going discreetly in Paris, and not concern yourself with this
end."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Mr. Polteed, "we can do it."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what is the manner between them?"</p>

<p>"I'll read you what she says," said Mr. Polteed, unlocking a
bureau drawer and taking out a file of papers; "she sums it up
somewhere confidentially. Yes, here it is! '17 very
attractive&mdash;conclude 47, longer in the tooth' (slang for age,
you know)&mdash;'distinctly gone&mdash;waiting his time&mdash;17
perhaps holding off for terms, impossible to say without knowing
more. But inclined to think on the whole&mdash;doesn't know her
mind&mdash;likely to act on impulse some day. Both have
style.'"</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" said Soames between close lips.</p>

<p>"Well," murmured Mr. Polteed with a smile, showing many white
teeth, "an expression we use. In other words, it's not likely to be
a weekend business&mdash;they'll come together seriously or not at
all."</p>

<p>"H'm!" muttered Soames, "that's all, is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Polteed, "but quite promising."</p>

<p>'Spider!' thought Soames. "Good-day!"</p>

<p>He walked into the Green Park that he might cross to Victoria
Station and take the Underground into the City. For so late in
January it was warm; sunlight, through the haze, sparkled on the
frosty grass&mdash;an illumined cobweb of a day.</p>

<p>Little spiders&mdash;and great spiders! And the greatest spinner
of all, his own tenacity, for ever wrapping its cocoon of threads
round any clear way out. What was that fellow hanging round Irene
for? Was it really as Polteed suggested? Or was Jolyon but taking
compassion on her loneliness, as he would call it&mdash;sentimental
radical chap that he had always been? If it were, indeed, as
Polteed hinted! Soames stood still. It could not be! The fellow was
seven years older than himself, no better looking! No richer! What
attraction had he?</p>

<p>'Besides, he's come back,' he thought; 'that doesn't
look&mdash;I'll go and see him!' and, taking out a card, he
wrote:</p>

<p>"If you can spare half an hour some afternoon this week, I shall
be at the Connoisseurs any day between 5.30 and 6, or I could come
to the Hotch Potch if you prefer it. I want to see you.&mdash;S.
F."</p>

<p>He walked up St. James's Street and confided it to the porter at
the Hotch Potch.</p>

<p>"Give Mr. Jolyon Forsyte this as soon as he comes in," he said,
and took one of the new motor cabs into the City...</p>

<p>Jolyon received that card the same afternoon, and turned his
face towards the Connoisseurs. What did Soames want now? Had he got
wind of Paris? And stepping across St. James's Street, he
determined to make no secret of his visit. 'But it won't do,' he
thought, 'to let him know she's there, unless he knows already.' In
this complicated state of mind he was conducted to where Soames was
drinking tea in a small bay-window.</p>

<p>"No tea, thanks," said Jolyon, "but I'll go on smoking if I
may."</p>

<p>The curtains were not yet drawn, though the lamps outside were
lighted; the two cousins sat waiting on each other.</p>

<p>"You've been in Paris, I hear," said Soames at last.</p>

<p>"Yes; just back."</p>

<p>"Young Val told me; he and your boy are going off, then?" Jolyon
nodded.</p>

<p>"You didn't happen to see Irene, I suppose. It appears she's
abroad somewhere."</p>

<p>Jolyon wreathed himself in smoke before he answered: "Yes, I saw
her."</p>

<p>"How was she?"</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>There was another silence; then Soames roused himself in his
chair.</p>

<p>"When I saw you last," he said, "I was in two minds. We talked,
and you expressed your opinion. I don't wish to reopen that
discussion. I only wanted to say this: My position with her is
extremely difficult. I don't want you to go using your influence
against me. What happened is a very long time ago. I'm going to ask
her to let bygones be bygones."</p>

<p>"You have asked her, you know," murmured Jolyon.</p>

<p>"The idea was new to her then; it came as a shock. But the more
she thinks of it, the more she must see that it's the only way out
for both of us."</p>

<p>"That's not my impression of her state of mind," said Jolyon
with particular calm. "And, forgive my saying, you misconceive the
matter if you think reason comes into it at all."</p>

<p>He saw his cousin's pale face grow paler&mdash;he had used,
without knowing it, Irene's own words.</p>

<p>"Thanks," muttered Soames, "but I see things perhaps more
plainly than you think. I only want to be sure that you won't try
to influence her against me."</p>

<p>"I don't know what makes you think I have any influence," said
Jolyon; "but if I have I'm bound to use it in the direction of what
I think is her happiness. I am what they call a 'feminist,' I
believe."</p>

<p>"Feminist!" repeated Soames, as if seeking to gain time. "Does
that mean that you're against me?"</p>

<p>"Bluntly," said Jolyon, "I'm against any woman living with any
man whom she definitely dislikes. It appears to me rotten."</p>

<p>"And I suppose each time you see her you put your opinions into
her mind."</p>

<p>"I am not likely to be seeing her."</p>

<p>"Not going back to Paris?"</p>

<p>"Not so far as I know," said Jolyon, conscious of the intent
watchfulness in Soames' face.</p>

<p>"Well, that's all I had to say. Anyone who comes between man and
wife, you know, incurs heavy responsibility."</p>

<p>Jolyon rose and made him a slight bow.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said, and, without offering to shake hands, moved
away, leaving Soames staring after him. 'We Forsytes,' thought
Jolyon, hailing a cab, 'are very civilised. With simpler folk that
might have come to a row. If it weren't for my boy going to the
war...' The war! A gust of his old doubt swept over him. A precious
war! Domination of peoples or of women! Attempts to master and
possess those who did not want you! The negation of gentle decency!
Possession, vested rights; and anyone 'agin' 'em&mdash;outcast!
'Thank Heaven!' he thought, 'I always felt "agin" 'em, anyway!'
Yes! Even before his first disastrous marriage he could remember
fuming over the bludgeoning of Ireland, or the matrimonial suits of
women trying to be free of men they loathed. Parsons would have it
that freedom of soul and body were quite different things!
Pernicious doctrine! Body and soul could not thus be separated.
Free will was the strength of any tie, and not its weakness. 'I
ought to have told Soames,' he thought, 'that I think him comic.
Ah! but he's tragic, too!' Was there anything, indeed, more tragic
in the world than a man enslaved by his own possessive instinct,
who couldn't see the sky for it, or even enter fully into what
another person felt! 'I must write and warn her,' he thought; 'he's
going to have another try.' And all the way home to Robin Hill he
rebelled at the strength of that duty to his son which prevented
him from posting back to Paris...</p>

<p>But Soames sat long in his chair, the prey of a no less gnawing
ache&mdash;a jealous ache, as if it had been revealed to him that
this fellow held precedence of himself, and had spun fresh threads
of resistance to his way out. 'Does that mean that you're against
me?' he had got nothing out of that disingenuous question.
Feminist! Phrasey fellow! 'I mustn't rush things,' he thought. 'I
have some breathing space; he's not going back to Paris, unless he
was lying. I'll let the spring come!' Though how the spring could
serve him, save by adding to his ache, he could not tell. And
gazing down into the street, where figures were passing from pool
to pool of the light from the high lamps, he thought: 'Nothing
seems any good&mdash;nothing seems worth while. I'm
loney&mdash;that's the trouble.'</p>

<p>He closed his eyes; and at once he seemed to see Irene, in a
dark street below a church&mdash;passing, turning her neck so that
he caught the gleam of her eyes and her white forehead under a
little dark hat, which had gold spangles on it and a veil hanging
down behind. He opened his eyes&mdash;so vividly he had seen her! A
woman was passing below, but not she! Oh no, there was nothing
there!</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;'HERE WE ARE AGAIN!'</h3>

<p>Imogen's frocks for her first season exercised the judgment of
her mother and the purse of her grandfather all through the month
of March. With Forsyte tenacity Winifred quested for perfection. It
took her mind off the slowly approaching rite which would give her
a freedom but doubtfully desired; took her mind, too, off her boy
and his fast approaching departure for a war from which the news
remained disquieting. Like bees busy on summer flowers, or bright
gadflies hovering and darting over spiky autumn blossoms, she and
her 'little daughter,' tall nearly as herself and with a bust
measurement not far inferior, hovered in the shops of Regent
Street, the establishments of Hanover Square and of Bond Street,
lost in consideration and the feel of fabrics. Dozens of young
women of striking deportment and peculiar gait paraded before
Winifred and Imogen, draped in 'creations.' The models&mdash;'Very
new, modom; quite the latest thing&mdash;' which those two
reluctantly turned down, would have filled a museum; the models
which they were obliged to have nearly emptied James' bank. It was
no good doing things by halves, Winifred felt, in view of the need
for making this first and sole untarnished season a conspicuous
success. Their patience in trying the patience of those impersonal
creatures who swam about before them could alone have been
displayed by such as were moved by faith. It was for Winifred a
long prostration before her dear goddess Fashion, fervent as a
Catholic might make before the Virgin; for Imogen an experience by
no means too unpleasant&mdash;she often looked so nice, and
flattery was implicit everywhere: in a word it was 'amusing.'</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 20th of March, having, as it were,
gutted Skywards, they had sought refreshment over the way at
Caramel and Baker's, and, stored with chocolate frothed at the top
with cream, turned homewards through Berkeley Square of an evening
touched with spring. Opening the door&mdash;freshly painted a light
olive-green; nothing neglected that year to give Imogen a good
send-off&mdash;Winifred passed towards the silver basket to see if
anyone had called, and suddenly her nostrils twitched. What was
that scent?</p>

<p>Imogen had taken up a novel sent from the library, and stood
absorbed. Rather sharply, because of the queer feeling in her
breast, Winifred said:</p>

<p>"Take that up, dear, and have a rest before dinner."</p>

<p>Imogen, still reading, passed up the stairs. Winifred heard the
door of her room slammed to, and drew a long savouring breath. Was
it spring tickling her senses&mdash;whipping up nostalgia for her
'clown,' against all wisdom and outraged virtue? A male scent! A
faint reek of cigars and lavender-water not smelt since that early
autumn night six months ago, when she had called him 'the limit.'
Whence came it, or was it ghost of scent&mdash;sheer emanation from
memory? She looked round her. Nothing&mdash;not a thing, no tiniest
disturbance of her hall, nor of the diningroom. A little day-dream
of a scent&mdash;illusory, saddening, silly! In the silver basket
were new cards, two with 'Mr. and Mrs. Polegate Thom,' and one with
'Mr. Polegate Thom' thereon; she sniffed them, but they smelled
severe. 'I must be tired,' she thought, 'I'll go and lie down.'
Upstairs the drawing-room was darkened, waiting for some hand to
give it evening light; and she passed on up to her bedroom. This,
too, was half-curtained and dim, for it was six o'clock. Winifred
threw off her coat&mdash;that scent again!&mdash;then stood, as if
shot, transfixed against the bed-rail. Something dark had risen
from the sofa in the far corner. A word of horror&mdash;in her
family&mdash;escaped her: "God!"</p>

<p>"It's I&mdash;Monty," said a voice.</p>

<p>Clutching the bed-rail, Winifred reached up and turned the
switch of the light hanging above her dressing-table. He appeared
just on the rim of the light's circumference, emblazoned from the
absence of his watch-chain down to boots neat and sooty brown,
but&mdash;yes!&mdash;split at the toecap. His chest and face were
shadowy. Surely he was thin&mdash;or was it a trick of the light?
He advanced, lighted now from toe-cap to the top of his dark
head&mdash;surely a little grizzled! His complexion had darkened,
sallowed; his black moustache had lost boldness, become sardonic;
there were lines which she did not know about his face. There was
no pin in his tie. His suit&mdash;ah!&mdash;she knew that&mdash;but
how unpressed, unglossy! She stared again at the toe-cap of his
boot. Something big and relentless had been 'at him,' had turned
and twisted, raked and scraped him. And she stayed, not speaking,
motionless, staring at that crack across the toe.</p>

<p>"Well!" he said, "I got the order. I'm back."</p>

<p>Winifred's bosom began to heave. The nostalgia for her husband
which had rushed up with that scent was struggling with a deeper
jealousy than any she had felt yet. There he was&mdash;a dark, and
as if harried, shadow of his sleek and brazen self! What force had
done this to him&mdash;squeezed him like an orange to its dry rind!
That woman!</p>

<p>"I'm back," he said again. "I've had a beastly time. By God! I
came steerage. I've got nothing but what I stand up in, and that
bag."</p>

<p>"And who has the rest?" cried Winifred, suddenly alive. "How
dared you come? You knew it was just for divorce that you got that
order to come back. Don't touch me!"</p>

<p>They held each to the rail of the big bed where they had spent
so many years of nights together. Many times, yes&mdash;many times
she had wanted him back. But now that he had come she was filled
with this cold and deadly resentment. He put his hand up to his
moustache; but did not frizz and twist it in the old familiar way,
he just pulled it downwards.</p>

<p>"Gad!" he said: "If you knew the time I've had!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad I don't!"</p>

<p>"Are the kids all right?"</p>

<p>Winifred nodded. "How did you get in?"</p>

<p>"With my key."</p>

<p>"Then the maids don't know. You can't stay here, Monty."</p>

<p>He uttered a little sardonic laugh.</p>

<p>"Where then?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere."</p>

<p>"Well, look at me! That&mdash;that damned..."</p>

<p>"If you mention her," cried Winifred, "I go straight out to Park
Lane and I don't come back."</p>

<p>Suddenly he did a simple thing, but so uncharacteristic that it
moved her. He shut his eyes. It was as if he had said: 'All right!
I'm dead to the world!'</p>

<p>"You can have a room for the night," she said; "your things are
still here. Only Imogen is at home."</p>

<p>He leaned back against the bed-rail. "Well, it's in your hands,"
and his own made a writhing movement. "I've been through it. You
needn't hit too hard&mdash;it isn't worth while. I've been
frightened; I've been frightened, Freddie."</p>

<p>That old pet name, disused for years and years, sent a shiver
through Winifred.</p>

<p>'What am I to do with him?' she thought. 'What in God's name am
I to do with him?'</p>

<p>"Got a cigarette?"</p>

<p>She gave him one from a little box she kept up there for when
she couldn't sleep at night, and lighted it. With that action the
matter-of-fact side of her nature came to life again.</p>

<p>"Go and have a hot bath. I'll put some clothes out for you in
the dressing-room. We can talk later."</p>

<p>He nodded, and fixed his eyes on her&mdash;they looked
half-dead, or was it that the folds in the lids had become
heavier?</p>

<p>'He's not the same,' she thought. He would never be quite the
same again! But what would he be?</p>

<p>"All right!" he said, and went towards the door. He even moved
differently, like a man who has lost illusion and doubts whether it
is worth while to move at all.</p>

<p>When he was gone, and she heard the water in the bath running,
she put out a complete set of garments on the bed in his
dressing-room, then went downstairs and fetched up the biscuit box
and whisky. Putting on her coat again, and listening a moment at
the bathroom door, she went down and out. In the street she
hesitated. Past seven o'clock! Would Soames be at his Club or at
Park Lane? She turned towards the latter. Back!</p>

<p>Soames had always feared it&mdash;she had sometimes hoped
it...Back! So like him&mdash;clown that he was&mdash;with this:
'Here we are again!' to make fools of them all&mdash;of the Law, of
Soames, of herself!</p>

<p>Yet to have done with the Law, not to have that murky cloud
hanging over her and the children! What a relief! Ah! but how to
accept his return? That 'woman' had ravaged him, taken from him
passion such as he had never bestowed on herself, such as she had
not thought him capable of. There was the sting! That selfish,
blatant 'clown' of hers, whom she herself had never really stirred,
had been swept and ungarnished by another woman! Insulting! Too
insulting! Not right, not decent to take him back! And yet she had
asked for him; the Law perhaps would make her now! He was as much
her husband as ever&mdash;she had put herself out of court! And all
he wanted, no doubt, was money&mdash;to keep him in cigars and
lavender-water! That scent! 'After all, I'm not old,' she thought,
'not old yet!' But that woman who had reduced him to those words:
'I've been through it. I've been frightened&mdash;frightened,
Freddie!' She neared her father's house, driven this way and that,
while all the time the Forsyte undertow was drawing her to deep
conclusion that after all he was her property, to be held against a
robbing world. And so she came to James'.</p>

<p>"Mr. Soames? In his room? I'll go up; don't say I'm here."</p>

<p>Her brother was dressing. She found him before a mirror, tying a
black bow with an air of despising its ends.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he said, contemplating her in the glass; "what's
wrong?"</p>

<p>"Monty!" said Winifred stonily.</p>

<p>Soames spun round. "What!"</p>

<p>"Back!"</p>

<p>"Hoist," muttered Soames, "with our own petard. Why the deuce
didn't you let me try cruelty? I always knew it was too much risk
this way."</p>

<p>"Oh! Don't talk about that! What shall I do?"</p>

<p>Soames answered, with a deep, deep sound.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Winifred impatiently.</p>

<p>"What has he to say for himself?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. One of his boots is split across the toe."</p>

<p>Soames stared at her.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "of course! On his beam ends. So&mdash;it begins
again! This'll about finish father."</p>

<p>"Can't we keep it from him?"</p>

<p>"Impossible. He has an uncanny flair for anything that's
worrying."</p>

<p>And he brooded, with fingers hooked into his blue silk braces.
"There ought to be some way in law," he muttered, "to make him
safe."</p>

<p>"No," cried Winifred, "I won't be made a fool of again; I'd
sooner put up with him."</p>

<p>The two stared at each other. Their hearts were full of feeling,
but they could give it no expression&mdash;Forsytes that they
were.</p>

<p>"Where did you leave him?"</p>

<p>"In the bath," and Winifred gave a little bitter laugh. "The
only thing he's brought back is lavender-water."</p>

<p>"Steady!" said Soames, "you're thoroughly upset. I'll go back
with you."</p>

<p>"What's the use?"</p>

<p>"We ought to make terms with him."</p>

<p>"Terms! It'll always be the same. When he recovers&mdash;cards
and betting, drink and...!" She was silent, remembering the look on
her husband's face. The burnt child&mdash;the burnt child.
Perhaps...!</p>

<p>"Recovers?" replied Soames: "Is he ill?"</p>

<p>"No; burnt out; that's all."</p>

<p>Soames took his waistcoat from a chair and put it on, he took
his coat and got into it, he scented his handkerchief with
eau-de-Cologne, threaded his watch-chain, and said: "We haven't any
luck."</p>

<p>And in the midst of her own trouble Winifred was sorry for him,
as if in that little saying he had revealed deep trouble of his
own.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see mother," she said.</p>

<p>"She'll be with father in their room. Come down quietly to the
study. I'll get her."</p>

<p>Winifred stole down to the little dark study, chiefly remarkable
for a Canaletto too doubtful to be placed elsewhere, and a fine
collection of Law Reports unopened for many years. Here she stood,
with her back to maroon-coloured curtains close-drawn, staring at
the empty grate, till her mother came in followed by Soames.</p>

<p>"Oh! my poor dear!" said Emily: "How miserable you look in here!
This is too bad of him, really!"</p>

<p>As a family they had so guarded themselves from the expression
of all unfashionable emotion that it was impossible to go up and
give her daughter a good hug. But there was comfort in her
cushioned voice, and her still dimpled shoulders under some rare
black lace. Summoning pride and the desire not to distress her
mother, Winifred said in her most off-hand voice:</p>

<p>"It's all right, Mother; no good fussing."</p>

<p>"I don't see," said Emily, looking at Soames, "why Winifred
shouldn't tell him that she'll prosecute him if he doesn't keep off
the premises. He took her pearls; and if he's not brought them
back, that's quite enough."</p>

<p>Winifred smiled. They would all plunge about with suggestions of
this and that, but she knew already what she would be doing, and
that was&mdash;nothing. The feeling that, after all, she had won a
sort of victory, retained her property, was every moment gaining
ground in her. No! if she wanted to punish him, she could do it at
home without the world knowing.</p>

<p>"Well," said Emily, "come into the dining-room
comfortably&mdash;you must stay and have dinner with us. Leave it
to me to tell your father." And, as Winifred moved towards the
door, she turned out the light. Not till then did they see the
disaster in the corridor.</p>

<p>There, attracted by light from a room never lighted, James was
standing with his duncoloured camel-hair shawl folded about him, so
that his arms were not free and his silvered head looked cut off
from his fashionably trousered legs as if by an expanse of desert.
He stood, inimitably stork-like, with an expression as if he saw
before him a frog too large to swallow.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" he said. "Tell your father? You never tell me
anything."</p>

<p>The moment found Emily without reply. It was Winifred who went
up to him, and, laying one hand on each of his swathed, helpless
arms, said:</p>

<p>"Monty's not gone bankrupt, Father. He's only come back."</p>

<p>They all three expected something serious to happen, and were
glad she had kept that grip of his arms, but they did not know the
depth of root in that shadowy old Forsyte. Something wry occurred
about his shaven mouth and chin, something scratchy between those
long silvery whiskers. Then he said with a sort of dignity: "He'll
be the death of me. I knew how it would be."</p>

<p>"You mustn't worry, Father," said Winifred calmly. "I mean to
make him behave."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said James. "Here, take this thing off, I'm hot." They
unwound the shawl. He turned, and walked firmly to the
dining-room.</p>

<p>"I don't want any soup," he said to Warmson, and sat down in his
chair. They all sat down too, Winifred still in her hat, while
Warmson laid the fourth place. When he left the room, James said:
"What's he brought back?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Father."</p>

<p>James concentrated his eyes on his own image in a tablespoon.
"Divorce!" he muttered; "rubbish! What was I about? I ought to have
paid him an allowance to stay out of England. Soames you go and
propose it to him."</p>

<p>It seemed so right and simple a suggestion that even Winifred
was surprised when she said: "No, I'll keep him now he's back; he
must just behave&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>They all looked at her. It had always been known that Winifred
had pluck.</p>

<p>"Out there!" said James elliptically, "who knows what
cut-throats! You look for his revolver! Don't go to bed without.
You ought to have Warmson to sleep in the house. I'll see him
myself tomorrow."</p>

<p>They were touched by this declaration, and Emily said
comfortably: "That's right, James, we won't have any nonsense."</p>

<p>"Ah!" muttered James darkly, "I can't tell."</p>

<p>The advent of Warmson with fish diverted conversation.</p>

<p>When, directly after dinner, Winifred went over to kiss her
father good-night, he looked up with eyes so full of question and
distress that she put all the comfort she could into her voice.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Daddy, dear; don't worry. I shan't need
anyone&mdash;he's quite bland. I shall only be upset if you worry.
Good-night, bless you!"</p>

<p>James repeated the words, "Bless you!" as if he did not quite
know what they meant, and his eyes followed her to the door.</p>

<p>She reached home before nine, and went straight upstairs.</p>

<p>Dartie was lying on the bed in his dressing-room, fully
redressed in a blue serge suit and pumps; his arms were crossed
behind his head, and an extinct cigarette drooped from his
mouth.</p>

<p>Winifred remembered ridiculously the flowers in her window-boxes
after a blazing summer day; the way they lay, or rather
stood&mdash;parched, yet rested by the sun's retreat. It was as if
a little dew had come already on her burnt-up husband.</p>

<p>He said apathetically: "I suppose you've been to Park Lane.
How's the old man?"</p>

<p>Winifred could not help the bitter answer: "Not dead."</p>

<p>He winced, actually he winced.</p>

<p>"Understand, Monty," she said, "I will not have him worried. If
you aren't going to behave yourself, you may go back, you may go
anywhere. Have you had dinner?"</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>"Would you like some?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Imogen offered me some. I didn't want any."</p>

<p>Imogen! In the plenitude of emotion Winifred had forgotten
her.</p>

<p>"So you've seen her? What did she say?"</p>

<p>"She gave me a kiss."</p>

<p>With mortification Winifred saw his dark sardonic face relaxed.
'Yes!' she thought, 'he cares for her, not for me a bit.'</p>

<p>Dartie's eyes were moving from side to side.</p>

<p>"Does she know about me?" he said.</p>

<p>It flashed through Winifred that here was the weapon she needed.
He minded their knowing!</p>

<p>"No. Val knows. The others don't; they only know you went
away."</p>

<p>She heard him sigh with relief.</p>

<p>"But they shall know," she said firmly, "if you give me
cause."</p>

<p>"All right!" he muttered, "hit me! I'm down!"</p>

<p>Winifred went up to the bed. "Look here, Monty! I don't want to
hit you. I don't want to hurt you. I shan't allude to anything. I'm
not going to worry. What's the use?" She was silent a moment. "I
can't stand any more, though, and I won't! You'd better know.
You've made me suffer. But I used to be fond of you. For the sake
of that..." She met the heavy-lidded gaze of his brown eyes with
the downward stare of her green-grey eyes; touched his hand
suddenly, turned her back, and went into her room.</p>

<p>She sat there a long time before her glass, fingering her rings,
thinking of this subdued dark man, almost a stranger to her, on the
bed in the other room; resolutely not 'worrying,' but gnawed by
jealousy of what he had been through, and now and again just
visited by pity.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;OUTLANDISH NIGHT</h3>

<p>Soames doggedly let the spring come&mdash;no easy task for one
conscious that time was flying, his birds in the bush no nearer the
hand, no issue from the web anywhere visible. Mr. Polteed reported
nothing, except that his watch went on&mdash;costing a lot of
money. Val and his cousin were gone to the war, whence came news
more favourable; Dartie was behaving himself so far; James had
retained his health; business prospered almost terribly&mdash;there
was nothing to worry Soames except that he was 'held up,' could
make no step in any direction.</p>

<p>He did not exactly avoid Soho, for he could not afford to let
them think that he had 'piped off,' as James would have put
it&mdash;he might want to 'pipe on' again at any minute. But he had
to be so restrained and cautious that he would often pass the door
of the Restaurant Bretagne without going in, and wander out of the
purlieus of that region which always gave him the feeling of having
been possessively irregular.</p>

<p>He wandered thus one May night into Regent Street and the most
amazing crowd he had ever seen; a shrieking, whistling, dancing,
jostling, grotesque and formidably jovial crowd, with false noses
and mouth-organs, penny whistles and long feathers, every appanage
of idiocy, as it seemed to him. Mafeking! Of course, it had been
relieved! Good! But was that an excuse? Who were these people, what
were they, where had they come from into the West End? His face was
tickled, his ears whistled into. Girls cried: 'Keep your hair on,
stucco!' A youth so knocked off his top-hat that he recovered it
with difficulty. Crackers were exploding beneath his nose, between
his feet. He was bewildered, exasperated, offended. This stream of
people came from every quarter, as if impulse had unlocked
flood-gates, let flow waters of whose existence he had heard,
perhaps, but believed in never. This, then, was the populace, the
innumerable living negation of gentility and Forsyteism. This
was&mdash;egad!&mdash;Democracy! It stank, yelled, was hideous! In
the East End, or even Soho, perhaps&mdash;but here in Regent
Street, in Piccadilly! What were the police about! In 1900, Soames,
with his Forsyte thousands, had never seen the cauldron with the
lid off; and now looking into it, could hardly believe his
scorching eyes. The whole thing was unspeakable! These people had
no restraint, they seemed to think him funny; such swarms of them,
rude, coarse, laughing&mdash;and what laughter!</p>

<p>Nothing sacred to them! He shouldn't be surprised if they began
to break windows. In Pall Mall, past those august dwellings, to
enter which people paid sixty pounds, this shrieking, whistling,
dancing dervish of a crowd was swarming. From the Club windows his
own kind were looking out on them with regulated amusement. They
didn't realise! Why, this was serious&mdash;might come to anything!
The crowd was cheerful, but some day they would come in different
mood! He remembered there had been a mob in the late eighties, when
he was at Brighton; they had smashed things and made speeches. But
more than dread, he felt a deep surprise. They were
hysterical&mdash;it wasn't English! And all about the relief of a
little town as big as&mdash;Watford, six thousand miles away.
Restraint, reserve! Those qualities to him more dear almost than
life, those indispensable attributes of property and culture, where
were they? It wasn't English! No, it wasn't English! So Soames
brooded, threading his way on. It was as if he had suddenly caught
sight of someone cutting the covenant 'for quiet possession' out of
his legal documents; or of a monster lurking and stalking out in
the future, casting its shadow before. Their want of stolidity,
their want of reverence! It was like discovering that nine-tenths
of the people of England were foreigners. And if that were
so&mdash;then, anything might happen!</p>

<p>At Hyde Park Corner he ran into George Forsyte, very sunburnt
from racing, holding a false nose in his hand.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Soames!" he said, "have a nose!"</p>

<p>Soames responded with a pale smile.</p>

<p>"Got this from one of these sportsmen," went on George, who had
evidently been dining; "had to lay him out&mdash;for trying to bash
my hat. I say, one of these days we shall have to fight these
chaps, they're getting so damned cheeky&mdash;all radicals and
socialists. They want our goods. You tell Uncle James that, it'll
make him sleep."</p>

<p>'In vino veritas,' thought Soames, but he only nodded, and
passed on up Hamilton Place. There was but a trickle of roysterers
in Park Lane, not very noisy. And looking up at the houses he
thought: 'After all, we're the backbone of the country. They won't
upset us easily. Possession's nine points of the law.'</p>

<p>But, as he closed the door of his father's house behind him, all
that queer outlandish nightmare in the streets passed out of his
mind almost as completely as if, having dreamed it, he had awakened
in the warm clean morning comfort of his spring-mattressed bed.</p>

<p>Walking into the centre of the great empty drawing-room, he
stood still.</p>

<p>A wife! Somebody to talk things over with. One had a right! Damn
it! One had a right!</p>

<h2>PART III</h2>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER I&mdash;SOAMES IN PARIS</h3>

<p>Soames had travelled little. Aged nineteen he had made the
'petty tour' with his father, mother, and Winifred&mdash;Brussels,
the Rhine, Switzerland, and home by way of Paris. Aged
twenty-seven, just when he began to take interest in pictures, he
had spent five hot weeks in Italy, looking into the
Renaissance&mdash;not so much in it as he had been led to
expect&mdash;and a fortnight in Paris on his way back, looking into
himself, as became a Forsyte surrounded by people so strongly
self-centred and 'foreign' as the French. His knowledge of their
language being derived from his public school, he did not
understand them when they spoke. Silence he had found better for
all parties; one did not make a fool of oneself. He had disliked
the look of the men's clothes, the closed-in cabs, the theatres
which looked like bee-hives, the Galleries which smelled of
beeswax. He was too cautious and too shy to explore that side of
Paris supposed by Forsytes to constitute its attraction under the
rose; and as for a collector's bargain&mdash;not one to be had! As
Nicholas might have put it&mdash;they were a grasping lot. He had
come back uneasy, saying Paris was overrated.</p>

<p>When, therefore, in June of 1900 he went to Paris, it was but
his third attempt on the centre of civilisation. This time,
however, the mountain was going to Mahomet; for he felt by now more
deeply civilised than Paris, and perhaps he really was. Moreover,
he had a definite objective. This was no mere genuflexion to a
shrine of taste and immorality, but the prosecution of his own
legitimate affairs. He went, indeed, because things were getting
past a joke. The watch went on and on,
and&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing! Jolyon had never returned to
Paris, and no one else was 'suspect!' Busy with new and very
confidential matters, Soames was realising more than ever how
essential reputation is to a solicitor. But at night and in his
leisure moments he was ravaged by the thought that time was always
flying and money flowing in, and his own future as much 'in irons'
as ever. Since Mafeking night he had become aware that a 'young
fool of a doctor' was hanging round Annette. Twice he had come
across him&mdash;a cheerful young fool, not more than thirty.</p>

<p>Nothing annoyed Soames so much as cheerfulness&mdash;an
indecent, extravagant sort of quality, which had no relation to
facts. The mixture of his desires and hopes was, in a word,
becoming torture; and lately the thought had come to him that
perhaps Irene knew she was being shadowed: It was this which
finally decided him to go and see for himself; to go and once more
try to break down her repugnance, her refusal to make her own and
his path comparatively smooth once more. If he failed
again&mdash;well, he would see what she did with herself,
anyway!</p>

<p>He went to an hotel in the Rue Caumartin, highly recommended to
Forsytes, where practically nobody spoke French. He had formed no
plan. He did not want to startle her; yet must contrive that she
had no chance to evade him by flight. And next morning he set out
in bright weather.</p>

<p>Paris had an air of gaiety, a sparkle over its star-shape which
almost annoyed Soames. He stepped gravely, his nose lifted a little
sideways in real curiosity. He desired now to understand things
French. Was not Annette French? There was much to be got out of his
visit, if he could only get it. In this laudable mood and the Place
de la Concorde he was nearly run down three times. He came on the
'Cours la Reine,' where Irene's hotel was situated, almost too
suddenly, for he had not yet fixed on his procedure. Crossing over
to the river side, he noted the building, white and
cheerful-looking, with green sunblinds, seen through a screen of
plane-tree leaves. And, conscious that it would be far better to
meet her casually in some open place than to risk a call, he sat
down on a bench whence he could watch the entrance. It was not
quite eleven o'clock, and improbable that she had yet gone out.
Some pigeons were strutting and preening their feathers in the
pools of sunlight between the shadows of the plane-trees. A workman
in a blue blouse passed, and threw them crumbs from the paper which
contained his dinner. A 'bonne' coiffed with ribbon shepherded two
little girls with pig-tails and frilled drawers. A cab meandered
by, whose cocher wore a blue coat and a black-glazed hat. To Soames
a kind of affectation seemed to cling about it all, a sort of
picturesqueness which was out of date. A theatrical people, the
French! He lit one of his rare cigarettes, with a sense of injury
that Fate should be casting his life into outlandish waters. He
shouldn't wonder if Irene quite enjoyed this foreign life; she had
never been properly English&mdash;even to look at! And he began
considering which of those windows could be hers under the green
sunblinds. How could he word what he had come to say so that it
might pierce the defence of her proud obstinacy? He threw the
fag-end of his cigarette at a pigeon, with the thought: 'I can't
stay here for ever twiddling my thumbs. Better give it up and call
on her in the late afternoon.' But he still sat on, heard twelve
strike, and then half-past. 'I'll wait till one,' he thought,
'while I'm about it.' But just then he started up, and shrinkingly
sat down again. A woman had come out in a cream-coloured frock, and
was moving away under a fawn-coloured parasol. Irene herself! He
waited till she was too far away to recognise him, then set out
after her. She was strolling as though she had no particular
objective; moving, if he remembered rightly, toward the Bois de
Boulogne. For half an hour at least he kept his distance on the far
side of the way till she had passed into the Bois itself. Was she
going to meet someone after all? Some confounded
Frenchman&mdash;one of those 'Bel Ami' chaps, perhaps, who had
nothing to do but hang about women&mdash;for he had read that book
with difficulty and a sort of disgusted fascination. He followed
doggedly along a shady alley, losing sight of her now and then when
the path curved. And it came back to him how, long ago, one night
in Hyde Park he had slid and sneaked from tree to tree, from seat
to seat, hunting blindly, ridiculously, in burning jealousy for her
and young Bosinney. The path bent sharply, and, hurrying, he came
on her sitting in front of a small fountain&mdash;a little
green-bronze Niobe veiled in hair to her slender hips, gazing at
the pool she had wept: He came on her so suddenly that he was past
before he could turn and take off his hat. She did not start up.
She had always had great self-command&mdash;it was one of the
things he most admired in her, one of his greatest grievances
against her, because he had never been able to tell what she was
thinking. Had she realised that he was following? Her
self-possession made him angry; and, disdaining to explain his
presence, he pointed to the mournful little Niobe, and said:</p>

<p>"That's rather a good thing."</p>

<p>He could see, then, that she was struggling to preserve her
composure.</p>

<p>"I didn't want to startle you; is this one of your haunts?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A little lonely." As he spoke, a lady, strolling by, paused to
look at the fountain and passed on.</p>

<p>Irene's eyes followed her.</p>

<p>"No," she said, prodding the ground with her parasol, "never
lonely. One has always one's shadow."</p>

<p>Soames understood; and, looking at her hard, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well, it's your own fault. You can be free of it at any moment.
Irene, come back to me, and be free."</p>

<p>Irene laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't!" cried Soames, stamping his foot; "it's inhuman. Listen!
Is there any condition I can make which will bring you back to me?
If I promise you a separate house&mdash;and just a visit now and
then?"</p>

<p>Irene rose, something wild suddenly in her face and figure.</p>

<p>"None! None! None! You may hunt me to the grave. I will not
come."</p>

<p>Outraged and on edge, Soames recoiled.</p>

<p>"Don't make a scene!" he said sharply. And they both stood
motionless, staring at the little Niobe, whose greenish flesh the
sunlight was burnishing.</p>

<p>"That's your last word, then," muttered Soames, clenching his
hands; "you condemn us both."</p>

<p>Irene bent her head. "I can't come back. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>A feeling of monstrous injustice flared up in Soames.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he said, "and listen to me a moment. You gave me a
sacred vow&mdash;you came to me without a penny. You had all I
could give you. You broke that vow without cause, you made me a
by-word; you refused me a child; you've left me in prison;
you&mdash;you still move me so that I want you&mdash;I want you.
Well, what do you think of yourself?"</p>

<p>Irene turned, her face was deadly pale, her eyes burning
dark.</p>

<p>"God made me as I am," she said; "wicked if you like&mdash;but
not so wicked that I'll give myself again to a man I hate."</p>

<p>The sunlight gleamed on her hair as she moved away, and seemed
to lay a caress all down her clinging cream-coloured frock.</p>

<p>Soames could neither speak nor move. That word 'hate'&mdash;so
extreme, so primitive&mdash;made all the Forsyte in him tremble.
With a deep imprecation he strode away from where she had vanished,
and ran almost into the arms of the lady sauntering back&mdash;the
fool, the shadowing fool!</p>

<p>He was soon dripping with perspiration, in the depths of the
Bois.</p>

<p>'Well,' he thought, 'I need have no consideration for her now;
she has not a grain of it for me. I'll show her this very day that
she's my wife still.'</p>

<p>But on the way home to his hotel, he was forced to the
conclusion that he did not know what he meant. One could not make
scenes in public, and short of scenes in public what was there he
could do? He almost cursed his own thin-skinnedness. She might
deserve no consideration; but he&mdash;alas! deserved some at his
own hands. And sitting lunchless in the hall of his hotel, with
tourists passing every moment, Baedeker in hand, he was visited by
black dejection. In irons! His whole life, with every natural
instinct and every decent yearning gagged and fettered, and all
because Fate had driven him seventeen years ago to set his heart
upon this woman&mdash;so utterly, that even now he had no real
heart to set on any other! Cursed was the day he had met her, and
his eyes for seeing in her anything but the cruel Venus she was!
And yet, still seeing her with the sunlight on the clinging China
crepe of her gown, he uttered a little groan, so that a tourist who
was passing, thought: 'Man in pain! Let's see! what did I have for
lunch?'</p>

<p>Later, in front of a cafe near the Opera, over a glass of cold
tea with lemon and a straw in it, he took the malicious resolution
to go and dine at her hotel. If she were there, he would speak to
her; if she were not, he would leave a note. He dressed carefully,
and wrote as follows:</p>

<p>"Your idyll with that fellow Jolyon Forsyte is known to me at
all events. If you pursue it, understand that I will leave no stone
unturned to make things unbearable for him. 'S. F.'"</p>

<p>He sealed this note but did not address it, refusing to write
the maiden name which she had impudently resumed, or to put the
word Forsyte on the envelope lest she should tear it up unread.
Then he went out, and made his way through the glowing streets,
abandoned to evening pleasure-seekers. Entering her hotel, he took
his seat in a far corner of the dining-room whence he could see all
entrances and exits. She was not there. He ate little, quickly,
watchfully. She did not come. He lingered in the lounge over his
coffee, drank two liqueurs of brandy. But still she did not come.
He went over to the keyboard and examined the names. Number twelve,
on the first floor! And he determined to take the note up himself.
He mounted red-carpeted stairs, past a little salon;
eight-ten-twelve! Should he knock, push the note under, or...? He
looked furtively round and turned the handle. The door opened, but
into a little space leading to another door; he knocked on
that&mdash;no answer. The door was locked. It fitted very closely
to the floor; the note would not go under. He thrust it back into
his pocket, and stood a moment listening. He felt somehow certain
that she was not there. And suddenly he came away, passing the
little salon down the stairs. He stopped at the bureau and
said:</p>

<p>"Will you kindly see that Mrs. Heron has this note?"</p>

<p>"Madame Heron left to-day, Monsieur&mdash;suddenly, about three
o'clock. There was illness in her family."</p>

<p>Soames compressed his lips. "Oh!" he said; "do you know her
address?"</p>

<p>"Non, Monsieur. England, I think."</p>

<p>Soames put the note back into his pocket and went out. He hailed
an open horse-cab which was passing.</p>

<p>"Drive me anywhere!"</p>

<p>The man, who, obviously, did not understand, smiled, and waved
his whip. And Soames was borne along in that little yellow-wheeled
Victoria all over star-shaped Paris, with here and there a pause,
and the question, "C'est par ici, Monsieur?" "No, go on," till the
man gave it up in despair, and the yellow-wheeled chariot continued
to roll between the tall, flat-fronted shuttered houses and
plane-tree avenues&mdash;a little Flying Dutchman of a cab.</p>

<p>'Like my life,' thought Soames, 'without object, on and on!'</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER II&mdash;IN THE WEB</h3>

<p>Soames returned to England the following day, and on the third
morning received a visit from Mr. Polteed, who wore a flower and
carried a brown billycock hat. Soames motioned him to a seat.</p>

<p>"The news from the war is not so bad, is it?" said Mr. Polteed.
"I hope I see you well, sir."</p>

<p>"Thanks! quite."</p>

<p>Mr. Polteed leaned forward, smiled, opened his hand, looked into
it, and said softly:</p>

<p>"I think we've done your business for you at last."</p>

<p>"What?" ejaculated Soames.</p>

<p>"Nineteen reports quite suddenly what I think we shall be
justified in calling conclusive evidence," and Mr. Polteed
paused.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"On the 10th instant, after witnessing an interview between 17
and a party, earlier in the day, 19 can swear to having seen him
coming out of her bedroom in the hotel about ten o'clock in the
evening. With a little care in the giving of the evidence that will
be enough, especially as 17 has left Paris&mdash;no doubt with the
party in question. In fact, they both slipped off, and we haven't
got on to them again, yet; but we shall&mdash;we shall. She's
worked hard under very difficult circumstances, and I'm glad she's
brought it off at last." Mr. Polteed took out a cigarette, tapped
its end against the table, looked at Soames, and put it back. The
expression on his client's face was not encouraging.</p>

<p>"Who is this new person?" said Soames abruptly.</p>

<p>"That we don't know. She'll swear to the fact, and she's got his
appearance pat."</p>

<p>Mr. Polteed took out a letter, and began reading:</p>

<p>"'Middle-aged, medium height, blue dittoes in afternoon, evening
dress at night, pale, dark hair, small dark moustache, flat cheeks,
good chin, grey eyes, small feet, guilty look...'"</p>

<p>Soames rose and went to the window. He stood there in sardonic
fury. Congenital idiot&mdash;spidery congenital idiot! Seven months
at fifteen pounds a week&mdash;to be tracked down as his own wife's
lover! Guilty look! He threw the window open.</p>

<p>"It's hot," he said, and came back to his seat.</p>

<p>Crossing his knees, he bent a supercilious glance on Mr.
Polteed.</p>

<p>"I doubt if that's quite good enough," he said, drawling the
words, "with no name or address. I think you may let that lady have
a rest, and take up our friend 47 at this end." Whether Polteed had
spotted him he could not tell; but he had a mental vision of him in
the midst of his cronies dissolved in inextinguishable laughter.
'Guilty look!' Damnation!</p>

<p>Mr. Polteed said in a tone of urgency, almost of pathos: "I
assure you we have put it through sometimes on less than that. It's
Paris, you know. Attractive woman living alone. Why not risk it,
sir? We might screw it up a peg."</p>

<p>Soames had sudden insight. The fellow's professional zeal was
stirred: 'Greatest triumph of my career; got a man his divorce
through a visit to his own wife's bedroom! Something to talk of
there, when I retire!' And for one wild moment he thought: 'Why
not?' After all, hundreds of men of medium height had small feet
and a guilty look!</p>

<p>"I'm not authorised to take any risk!" he said shortly.</p>

<p>Mr. Polteed looked up.</p>

<p>"Pity," he said, "quite a pity! That other affair seemed very
costive."</p>

<p>Soames rose.</p>

<p>"Never mind that. Please watch 47, and take care not to find a
mare's nest. Good-morning!"</p>

<p>Mr. Polteed's eye glinted at the words 'mare's nest!'</p>

<p>"Very good. You shall be kept informed."</p>

<p>And Soames was alone again. The spidery, dirty, ridiculous
business! Laying his arms on the table, he leaned his forehead on
them. Full ten minutes he rested thus, till a managing clerk roused
him with the draft prospectus of a new issue of shares, very
desirable, in Manifold and Topping's. That afternoon he left work
early and made his way to the Restaurant Bretagne. Only Madame
Lamotte was in. Would Monsieur have tea with her?</p>

<p>Soames bowed.</p>

<p>When they were seated at right angles to each other in the
little room, he said abruptly:</p>

<p>"I want a talk with you, Madame."</p>

<p>The quick lift of her clear brown eyes told him that she had
long expected such words.</p>

<p>"I have to ask you something first: That young
doctor&mdash;what's his name? Is there anything between him and
Annette?"</p>

<p>Her whole personality had become, as it were, like
jet&mdash;clear-cut, black, hard, shining.</p>

<p>"Annette is young," she said; "so is monsieur le docteur.
Between young people things move quickly; but Annette is a good
daughter. Ah! what a jewel of a nature!"</p>

<p>The least little smile twisted Soames' lips.</p>

<p>"Nothing definite, then?"</p>

<p>"But definite&mdash;no, indeed! The young man is veree nice,
but&mdash;what would you? There is no money at present."</p>

<p>She raised her willow-patterned tea-cup; Soames did the same.
Their eyes met.</p>

<p>"I am a married man," he said, "living apart from my wife for
many years. I am seeking to divorce her."</p>

<p>Madame Lamotte put down her cup. Indeed! What tragic things
there were! The entire absence of sentiment in her inspired a queer
species of contempt in Soames.</p>

<p>"I am a rich man," he added, fully conscious that the remark was
not in good taste. "It is useless to say more at present, but I
think you understand."</p>

<p>Madame's eyes, so open that the whites showed above them, looked
at him very straight.</p>

<p>"Ah! ca&mdash;mais nous avons le temps!" was all she said.
"Another little cup?" Soames refused, and, taking his leave, walked
westward.</p>

<p>He had got that off his mind; she would not let Annette commit
herself with that cheerful young ass until...! But what chance of
his ever being able to say: 'I'm free.' What chance? The future had
lost all semblance of reality. He felt like a fly, entangled in
cobweb filaments, watching the desirable freedom of the air with
pitiful eyes.</p>

<p>He was short of exercise, and wandered on to Kensington Gardens,
and down Queen's Gate towards Chelsea. Perhaps she had gone back to
her flat. That at all events he could find out. For since that last
and most ignominious repulse his wounded self-respect had taken
refuge again in the feeling that she must have a lover. He arrived
before the little Mansions at the dinner-hour. No need to enquire!
A grey-haired lady was watering the flower-boxes in her window. It
was evidently let. And he walked slowly past again, along the
river&mdash;an evening of clear, quiet beauty, all harmony and
comfort, except within his heart.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER III&mdash;RICHMOND PARK</h3>

<p>On the afternoon that Soames crossed to France a cablegram was
received by Jolyon at Robin Hill:</p>

<p>"Your son down with enteric no immediate danger will cable
again."</p>

<p>It reached a household already agitated by the imminent
departure of June, whose berth was booked for the following day.
She was, indeed, in the act of confiding Eric Cobbley and his
family to her father's care when the message arrived.</p>

<p>The resolution to become a Red Cross nurse, taken under stimulus
of Jolly's enlistment, had been loyally fulfilled with the
irritation and regret which all Forsytes feel at what curtails
their individual liberties. Enthusiastic at first about the
'wonderfulness' of the work, she had begun after a month to feel
that she could train herself so much better than others could train
her. And if Holly had not insisted on following her example, and
being trained too, she must inevitably have 'cried off.' The
departure of Jolly and Val with their troop in April had further
stiffened her failing resolve. But now, on the point of departure,
the thought of leaving Eric Cobbley, with a wife and two children,
adrift in the cold waters of an unappreciative world weighed on her
so that she was still in danger of backing out. The reading of that
cablegram, with its disquieting reality, clinched the matter. She
saw herself already nursing Jolly&mdash;for of course they would
let her nurse her own brother! Jolyon&mdash;ever wide and
doubtful&mdash;had no such hope. Poor June!</p>

<p>Could any Forsyte of her generation grasp how rude and brutal
life was? Ever since he knew of his boy's arrival at Cape Town the
thought of him had been a kind of recurrent sickness in Jolyon. He
could not get reconciled to the feeling that Jolly was in danger
all the time. The cablegram, grave though it was, was almost a
relief. He was now safe from bullets, anyway. And yet&mdash;this
enteric was a virulent disease! The Times was full of deaths
therefrom. Why could he not be lying out there in that up-country
hospital, and his boy safe at home? The un-Forsytean self-sacrifice
of his three children, indeed, had quite bewildered Jolyon. He
would eagerly change places with Jolly, because he loved his boy;
but no such personal motive was influencing them. He could only
think that it marked the decline of the Forsyte type.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon Holly came out to him under the old
oak-tree. She had grown up very much during these last months of
hospital training away from home. And, seeing her approach, he
thought: 'She has more sense than June, child though she is; more
wisdom. Thank God she isn't going out.' She had seated herself in
the swing, very silent and still. 'She feels this,' thought Jolyon,
'as much as I' and, seeing her eyes fixed on him, he said: "Don't
take it to heart too much, my child. If he weren't ill, he might be
in much greater danger."</p>

<p>Holly got out of the swing.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you something, Dad. It was through me that Jolly
enlisted and went out."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"When you were away in Paris, Val Dartie and I fell in love. We
used to ride in Richmond Park; we got engaged. Jolly found it out,
and thought he ought to stop it; so he dared Val to enlist. It was
all my fault, Dad; and I want to go out too. Because if anything
happens to either of them I should feel awful. Besides, I'm just as
much trained as June."</p>

<p>Jolyon gazed at her in a stupefaction that was tinged with
irony. So this was the answer to the riddle he had been asking
himself; and his three children were Forsytes after all. Surely
Holly might have told him all this before! But he smothered the
sarcastic sayings on his lips. Tenderness to the young was perhaps
the most sacred article of his belief. He had got, no doubt, what
he deserved. Engaged! So this was why he had so lost touch with
her! And to young Val Dartie&mdash;nephew of Soames&mdash;in the
other camp! It was all terribly distasteful. He closed his easel,
and set his drawing against the tree.</p>

<p>"Have you told June?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she says she'll get me into her cabin somehow. It's a
single cabin; but one of us could sleep on the floor. If you
consent, she'll go up now and get permission."</p>

<p>'Consent?' thought Jolyon. 'Rather late in the day to ask for
that!' But again he checked himself.</p>

<p>"You're too young, my dear; they won't let you."</p>

<p>"June knows some people that she helped to go to Cape Town. If
they won't let me nurse yet, I could stay with them and go on
training there. Let me go, Dad!"</p>

<p>Jolyon smiled because he could have cried.</p>

<p>"I never stop anyone from doing anything," he said.</p>

<p>Holly flung her arms round his neck.</p>

<p>"Oh! Dad, you are the best in the world."</p>

<p>'That means the worst,' thought Jolyon. If he had ever doubted
his creed of tolerance he did so then.</p>

<p>"I'm not friendly with Val's family," he said, "and I don't know
Val, but Jolly didn't like him."</p>

<p>Holly looked at the distance and said:</p>

<p>"I love him."</p>

<p>"That settles it," said Jolyon dryly, then catching the
expression on her face, he kissed her, with the thought: 'Is
anything more pathetic than the faith of the young?' Unless he
actually forbade her going it was obvious that he must make the
best of it, so he went up to town with June. Whether due to her
persistence, or the fact that the official they saw was an old
school friend of Jolyon's, they obtained permission for Holly to
share the single cabin. He took them to Surbiton station the
following evening, and they duly slid away from him, provided with
money, invalid foods, and those letters of credit without which
Forsytes do not travel.</p>

<p>He drove back to Robin Hill under a brilliant sky to his late
dinner, served with an added care by servants trying to show him
that they sympathised, eaten with an added scrupulousness to show
them that he appreciated their sympathy. But it was a real relief
to get to his cigar on the terrace of flag-stones&mdash;cunningly
chosen by young Bosinney for shape and colour&mdash;with night
closing in around him, so beautiful a night, hardly whispering in
the trees, and smelling so sweet that it made him ache. The grass
was drenched with dew, and he kept to those flagstones, up and
down, till presently it began to seem to him that he was one of
three, not wheeling, but turning right about at each end, so that
his father was always nearest to the house, and his son always
nearest to the terrace edge. Each had an arm lightly within his
arm; he dared not lift his hand to his cigar lest he should disturb
them, and it burned away, dripping ash on him, till it dropped from
his lips, at last, which were getting hot. They left him then, and
his arms felt chilly. Three Jolyons in one Jolyon they had
walked.</p>

<p>He stood still, counting the sounds&mdash;a carriage passing on
the highroad, a distant train, the dog at Gage's farm, the
whispering trees, the groom playing on his penny whistle. A
multitude of stars up there&mdash;bright and silent, so far off! No
moon as yet! Just enough light to show him the dark flags and
swords of the iris flowers along the terrace edge&mdash;his
favourite flower that had the night's own colour on its curving
crumpled petals. He turned round to the house. Big, unlighted, not
a soul beside himself to live in all that part of it. Stark
loneliness! He could not go on living here alone. And yet, so long
as there was beauty, why should a man feel lonely? The
answer&mdash;as to some idiot's riddle&mdash;was: Because he did.
The greater the beauty, the greater the loneliness, for at the back
of beauty was harmony, and at the back of harmony was&mdash;union.
Beauty could not comfort if the soul were out of it. The night,
maddeningly lovely, with bloom of grapes on it in starshine, and
the breath of grass and honey coming from it, he could not enjoy,
while she who was to him the life of beauty, its embodiment and
essence, was cut off from him, utterly cut off now, he felt, by
honourable decency.</p>

<p>He made a poor fist of sleeping, striving too hard after that
resignation which Forsytes find difficult to reach, bred to their
own way and left so comfortably off by their fathers. But after
dawn he dozed off, and soon was dreaming a strange dream.</p>

<p>He was on a stage with immensely high rich curtains&mdash;high
as the very stars&mdash;stretching in a semi-circle from footlights
to footlights. He himself was very small, a little black restless
figure roaming up and down; and the odd thing was that he was not
altogether himself, but Soames as well, so that he was not only
experiencing but watching. This figure of himself and Soames was
trying to find a way out through the curtains, which, heavy and
dark, kept him in. Several times he had crossed in front of them
before he saw with delight a sudden narrow rift&mdash;a tall chink
of beauty the colour of iris flowers, like a glimpse of Paradise,
remote, ineffable. Stepping quickly forward to pass into it, he
found the curtains closing before him. Bitterly disappointed
he&mdash;or was it Soames?&mdash;moved on, and there was the chink
again through the parted curtains, which again closed too soon.
This went on and on and he never got through till he woke with the
word "Irene" on his lips. The dream disturbed him badly, especially
that identification of himself with Soames.</p>

<p>Next morning, finding it impossible to work, he spent hours
riding Jolly's horse in search of fatigue. And on the second day he
made up his mind to move to London and see if he could not get
permission to follow his daughters to South Africa. He had just
begun to pack the following morning when he received this
letter:</p>

<blockquote>"GREEN HOTEL,<br>
"June 13.<br>
"RICHMOND.<br>
<br>
"MY DEAR JOLYON,<br>
<br>
"You will be surprised to see how near I am to you. Paris became
impossible&mdash;and I have come here to be within reach of your
advice. I would so love to see you again. Since you left Paris I
don't think I have met anyone I could really talk to. Is all well
with you and with your boy? No one knows, I think, that I am here
at present.<br>
<br>
"Always your friend,<br>
"IRENE."</blockquote>

<p>Irene within three miles of him!&mdash;and again in flight! He
stood with a very queer smile on his lips. This was more than he
had bargained for!</p>

<p>About noon he set out on foot across Richmond Park, and as he
went along, he thought: 'Richmond Park! By Jove, it suits us
Forsytes!' Not that Forsytes lived there&mdash;nobody lived there
save royalty, rangers, and the deer&mdash;but in Richmond Park
Nature was allowed to go so far and no further, putting up a brave
show of being natural, seeming to say: 'Look at my
instincts&mdash;they are almost passions, very nearly out of hand,
but not quite, of course; the very hub of possession is to possess
oneself.' Yes! Richmond Park possessed itself, even on that bright
day of June, with arrowy cuckoos shifting the tree-points of their
calls, and the wood doves announcing high summer.</p>

<p>The Green Hotel, which Jolyon entered at one o'clock, stood
nearly opposite that more famous hostelry, the Crown and Sceptre;
it was modest, highly respectable, never out of cold beef,
gooseberry tart, and a dowager or two, so that a carriage and pair
was almost always standing before the door.</p>

<p>In a room draped in chintz so slippery as to forbid all emotion,
Irene was sitting on a piano stool covered with crewel work,
playing 'Hansel and Gretel' out of an old score. Above her on a
wall, not yet Morris-papered, was a print of the Queen on a pony,
amongst deer-hounds, Scotch caps, and slain stags; beside her in a
pot on the window-sill was a white and rosy fuchsia. The
Victorianism of the room almost talked; and in her clinging frock
Irene seemed to Jolyon like Venus emerging from the shell of the
past century.</p>

<p>"If the proprietor had eyes," he said, "he would show you the
door; you have broken through his decorations." Thus lightly he
smothered up an emotional moment. Having eaten cold beef, pickled
walnut, gooseberry tart, and drunk stone-bottle ginger-beer, they
walked into the Park, and light talk was succeeded by the silence
Jolyon had dreaded.</p>

<p>"You haven't told me about Paris," he said at last.</p>

<p>"No. I've been shadowed for a long time; one gets used to that.
But then Soames came. By the little Niobe&mdash;the same story;
would I go back to him?"</p>

<p>"Incredible!"</p>

<p>She had spoken without raising her eyes, but she looked up now.
Those dark eyes clinging to his said as no words could have: 'I
have come to an end; if you want me, here I am.'</p>

<p>For sheer emotional intensity had he ever&mdash;old as he
was&mdash;passed through such a moment?</p>

<p>The words: 'Irene, I adore you!' almost escaped him. Then, with
a clearness of which he would not have believed mental vision
capable, he saw Jolly lying with a white face turned to a white
wall.</p>

<p>"My boy is very ill out there," he said quietly.</p>

<p>Irene slipped her arm through his.</p>

<p>"Let's walk on; I understand."</p>

<p>No miserable explanation to attempt! She had understood! And
they walked on among the bracken, knee-high already, between the
rabbit-holes and the oak-trees, talking of Jolly. He left her two
hours later at the Richmond Hill Gate, and turned towards home.</p>

<p>'She knows of my feeling for her, then,' he thought. Of course!
One could not keep knowledge of that from such a woman!</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER IV&mdash;OVER THE RIVER</h3>

<p>Jolly was tired to death of dreams. They had left him now too
wan and weak to dream again; left him to lie torpid, faintly
remembering far-off things; just able to turn his eyes and gaze
through the window near his cot at the trickle of river running by
in the sands, at the straggling milk-bush of the Karoo beyond. He
knew what the Karoo was now, even if he had not seen a Boer roll
over like a rabbit, or heard the whine of flying bullets. This
pestilence had sneaked on him before he had smelled powder. A
thirsty day and a rash drink, or perhaps a tainted fruit&mdash;who
knew? Not he, who had not even strength left to grudge the evil
thing its victory&mdash;just enough to know that there were many
lying here with him, that he was sore with frenzied dreaming; just
enough to watch that thread of river and be able to remember
faintly those far-away things...</p>

<p>The sun was nearly down. It would be cooler soon. He would have
liked to know the time&mdash;to feel his old watch, so
butter-smooth, to hear the repeater strike. It would have been
friendly, home-like. He had not even strength to remember that the
old watch was last wound the day he began to lie here. The pulse of
his brain beat so feebly that faces which came and went, nurse's,
doctor's, orderly's, were indistinguishable, just one indifferent
face; and the words spoken about him meant all the same thing, and
that almost nothing. Those things he used to do, though far and
faint, were more distinct&mdash;walking past the foot of the old
steps at Harrow 'bill'&mdash;'Here, sir! Here, sir!'&mdash;wrapping
boots in the Westminster Gazette, greenish paper, shining
boots&mdash;grandfather coming from somewhere dark&mdash;a smell of
earth&mdash;the mushroom house! Robin Hill! Burying poor old
Balthasar in the leaves! Dad! Home...</p>

<p>Consciousness came again with noticing that the river had no
water in it&mdash;someone was speaking too. Want anything? No. What
could one want? Too weak to want&mdash;only to hear his watch
strike...</p>

<p>Holly! She wouldn't bowl properly. Oh! Pitch them up! Not
sneaks!... 'Back her, Two and Bow!' He was Two!...Consciousness
came once more with a sense of the violet dusk outside, and a
rising blood-red crescent moon. His eyes rested on it fascinated;
in the long minutes of brain-nothingness it went moving up and
up...</p>

<p>"He's going, doctor!" Not pack boots again? Never? 'Mind your
form, Two!' Don't cry! Go quietly&mdash;over the
river&mdash;sleep!...Dark? If somebody
would&mdash;strike&mdash;his&mdash;watch!...</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER V&mdash;SOAMES ACTS</h3>

<p>A sealed letter in the handwriting of Mr. Polteed remained
unopened in Soames' pocket throughout two hours of sustained
attention to the affairs of the 'New Colliery Company,' which,
declining almost from the moment of old Jolyon's retirement from
the Chairmanship, had lately run down so fast that there was now
nothing for it but a 'winding-up.' He took the letter out to lunch
at his City Club, sacred to him for the meals he had eaten there
with his father in the early seventies, when James used to like him
to come and see for himself the nature of his future life.</p>

<p>Here in a remote corner before a plate of roast mutton and
mashed potato, he read:</p>

<blockquote>"DEAR SIR,<br>
<br>
"In accordance with your suggestion we have duly taken the matter
up at the other end with gratifying results. Observation of 47 has
enabled us to locate 17 at the Green Hotel, Richmond. The two have
been observed to meet daily during the past week in Richmond Park.
Nothing absolutely crucial has so far been notified. But in
conjunction with what we had from Paris at the beginning of the
year, I am confident we could now satisfy the Court. We shall, of
course, continue to watch the matter until we hear from you.<br>
<br>
"Very faithfully yours,<br>
"CLAUD POLTEED."</blockquote>

<p>Soames read it through twice and beckoned to the waiter:</p>

<p>"Take this away; it's cold."</p>

<p>"Shall I bring you some more, sir?"</p>

<p>"No. Get me some coffee in the other room."</p>

<p>And, paying for what he had not eaten, he went out, passing two
acquaintances without sign of recognition.</p>

<p>'Satisfy the Court!' he thought, sitting at a little round
marble table with the coffee before him. That fellow Jolyon! He
poured out his coffee, sweetened and drank it. He would disgrace
him in the eyes of his own children! And rising, with that
resolution hot within him, he found for the first time the
inconvenience of being his own solicitor. He could not treat this
scandalous matter in his own office. He must commit the soul of his
private dignity to a stranger, some other professional dealer in
family dishonour. Who was there he could go to? Linkman and Laver
in Budge Row, perhaps&mdash;reliable, not too conspicuous, only
nodding acquaintances. But before he saw them he must see Polteed
again. But at this thought Soames had a moment of sheer weakness.
To part with his secret? How find the words? How subject himself to
contempt and secret laughter? Yet, after all, the fellow knew
already&mdash;oh yes, he knew! And, feeling that he must finish
with it now, he took a cab into the West End.</p>

<p>In this hot weather the window of Mr. Polteed's room was
positively open, and the only precaution was a wire gauze,
preventing the intrusion of flies. Two or three had tried to come
in, and been caught, so that they seemed to be clinging there with
the intention of being devoured presently. Mr. Polteed, following
the direction of his client's eye, rose apologetically and closed
the window.</p>

<p>'Posing ass!' thought Soames. Like all who fundamentally believe
in themselves he was rising to the occasion, and, with his little
sideway smile, he said: "I've had your letter. I'm going to act. I
suppose you know who the lady you've been watching really is?" Mr.
Polteed's expression at that moment was a masterpiece. It so
clearly said: 'Well, what do you think? But mere professional
knowledge, I assure you&mdash;pray forgive it!' He made a little
half airy movement with his hand, as who should say: 'Such
things&mdash;such things will happen to us all!'</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Soames, moistening his lips: "there's no
need to say more. I'm instructing Linkman and Laver of Budge Row to
act for me. I don't want to hear your evidence, but kindly make
your report to them at five o'clock, and continue to observe the
utmost secrecy."</p>

<p>Mr. Polteed half closed his eyes, as if to comply at once. "My
dear sir," he said.</p>

<p>"Are you convinced," asked Soames with sudden energy, "that
there is enough?"</p>

<p>The faintest movement occurred to Mr. Polteed's shoulders.</p>

<p>"You can risk it," he murmured; "with what we have, and human
nature, you can risk it."</p>

<p>Soames rose. "You will ask for Mr. Linkman. Thanks; don't get
up." He could not bear Mr. Polteed to slide as usual between him
and the door. In the sunlight of Piccadilly he wiped his forehead.
This had been the worst of it&mdash;he could stand the strangers
better. And he went back into the City to do what still lay before
him.</p>

<p>That evening in Park Lane, watching his father dine, he was
overwhelmed by his old longing for a son&mdash;a son, to watch him
eat as he went down the years, to be taken on his knee as James on
a time had been wont to take him; a son of his own begetting, who
could understand him because he was the same flesh and
blood&mdash;understand, and comfort him, and become more rich and
cultured than himself because he would start even better off. To
get old&mdash;like that thin, grey wiry-frail figure sitting
there&mdash;and be quite alone with possessions heaping up around
him; to take no interest in anything because it had no future and
must pass away from him to hands and mouths and eyes for whom he
cared no jot! No! He would force it through now, and be free to
marry, and have a son to care for him before he grew to be like the
old old man his father, wistfully watching now his sweetbread, now
his son.</p>

<p>In that mood he went up to bed. But, lying warm between those
fine linen sheets of Emily's providing, he was visited by memories
and torture. Visions of Irene, almost the solid feeling of her
body, beset him. Why had he ever been fool enough to see her again,
and let this flood back on him so that it was pain to think of her
with that fellow&mdash;that stealing fellow.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER VI&mdash;A SUMMER DAY</h3>

<p>His boy was seldom absent from Jolyon's mind in the days which
followed the first walk with Irene in Richmond Park. No further
news had come; enquiries at the War Office elicited nothing; nor
could he expect to hear from June and Holly for three weeks at
least. In these days he felt how insufficient were his memories of
Jolly, and what an amateur of a father he had been. There was not a
single memory in which anger played a part; not one reconciliation,
because there had never been a rupture; nor one heart-to-heart
confidence, not even when Jolly's mother died. Nothing but
half-ironical affection. He had been too afraid of committing
himself in any direction, for fear of losing his liberty, or
interfering with that of his boy.</p>

<p>Only in Irene's presence had he relief, highly complicated by
the ever-growing perception of how divided he was between her and
his son. With Jolly was bound up all that sense of continuity and
social creed of which he had drunk deeply in his youth and again
during his boy's public school and varsity life&mdash;all that
sense of not going back on what father and son expected of each
other. With Irene was bound up all his delight in beauty and in
Nature. And he seemed to know less and less which was the stronger
within him. From such sentimental paralysis he was rudely awakened,
however, one afternoon, just as he was starting off to Richmond, by
a young man with a bicycle and a face oddly familiar, who came
forward faintly smiling.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jolyon Forsyte? Thank you!" Placing an envelope in Jolyon's
hand he wheeled off the path and rode away. Bewildered, Jolyon
opened it.</p>

<p>"Admiralty Probate and Divorce, Forsyte v. Forsyte and
Forsyte!"</p>

<p>A sensation of shame and disgust was followed by the instant
reaction 'Why, here's the very thing you want, and you don't like
it!' But she must have had one too; and he must go to her at once.
He turned things over as he went along. It was an ironical
business. For, whatever the Scriptures said about the heart, it
took more than mere longings to satisfy the law. They could
perfectly well defend this suit, or at least in good faith try to.
But the idea of doing so revolted Jolyon. If not her lover in deed
he was in desire, and he knew that she was ready to come to him.
Her face had told him so. Not that he exaggerated her feeling for
him. She had had her grand passion, and he could not expect another
from her at his age. But she had trust in him, affection for him,
and must feel that he would be a refuge. Surely she would not ask
him to defend the suit, knowing that he adored her! Thank Heaven
she had not that maddening British conscientiousness which refused
happiness for the sake of refusing! She must rejoice at this chance
of being free after seventeen years of death in life! As to
publicity, the fat was in the fire! To defend the suit would not
take away the slur. Jolyon had all the proper feeling of a Forsyte
whose privacy is threatened: If he was to be hung by the Law, by
all means let it be for a sheep! Moreover the notion of standing in
a witness box and swearing to the truth that no gesture, not even a
word of love had passed between them seemed to him more degrading
than to take the tacit stigma of being an adulterer&mdash;more
truly degrading, considering the feeling in his heart, and just as
bad and painful for his children. The thought of explaining away,
if he could, before a judge and twelve average Englishmen, their
meetings in Paris, and the walks in Richmond Park, horrified him.
The brutality and hypocritical censoriousness of the whole process;
the probability that they would not be believed&mdash;the mere
vision of her, whom he looked on as the embodiment of Nature and of
Beauty, standing there before all those suspicious, gloating eyes
was hideous to him. No, no! To defend a suit only made a London
holiday, and sold the newspapers. A thousand times better accept
what Soames and the gods had sent!</p>

<p>'Besides,' he thought honestly, 'who knows whether, even for my
boy's sake, I could have stood this state of things much longer?
Anyway, her neck will be out of chancery at last!' Thus absorbed,
he was hardly conscious of the heavy heat. The sky had become
overcast, purplish with little streaks of white. A heavy heat-drop
plashed a little star pattern in the dust of the road as he entered
the Park. 'Phew!' he thought, 'thunder! I hope she's not come to
meet me; there's a ducking up there!' But at that very minute he
saw Irene coming towards the Gate. 'We must scuttle back to Robin
Hill,' he thought.</p>

<hr>

<p>The storm had passed over the Poultry at four o'clock, bringing
welcome distraction to the clerks in every office. Soames was
drinking a cup of tea when a note was brought in to him:</p>

<blockquote>"DEAR SIR,<br>
<br>
"Forsyte v. Forsyte and Forsyte<br>
<br>
"In accordance with your instructions, we beg to inform you that we
personally served the respondent and co-respondent in this suit
to-day, at Richmond, and Robin Hill, respectively.<br>
<br>
"Faithfully yours,<br>
"LINKMAN AND LAVER."</blockquote>

<p>For some minutes Soames stared at that note. Ever since he had
given those instructions he had been tempted to annul them. It was
so scandalous, such a general disgrace! The evidence, too, what he
had heard of it, had never seemed to him conclusive; somehow, he
believed less and less that those two had gone all lengths. But
this, of course, would drive them to it; and he suffered from the
thought. That fellow to have her love, where he had failed! Was it
too late? Now that they had been brought up sharp by service of
this petition, had he not a lever with which he could force them
apart? 'But if I don't act at once,' he thought, 'it will be too
late, now they've had this thing. I'll go and see him; I'll go
down!'</p>

<p>And, sick with nervous anxiety, he sent out for one of the
'new-fangled' motor-cabs. It might take a long time to run that
fellow to ground, and Goodness knew what decision they might come
to after such a shock! 'If I were a theatrical ass,' he thought, 'I
suppose I should be taking a horse-whip or a pistol or something!'
He took instead a bundle of papers in the case of 'Magentie versus
Wake,' intending to read them on the way down. He did not even open
them, but sat quite still, jolted and jarred, unconscious of the
draught down the back of his neck, or the smell of petrol. He must
be guided by the fellow's attitude; the great thing was to keep his
head!</p>

<p>London had already begun to disgorge its workers as he neared
Putney Bridge; the ant-heap was on the move outwards. What a lot of
ants, all with a living to get, holding on by their eyelids in the
great scramble! Perhaps for the first time in his life Soames
thought: 'I could let go if I liked! Nothing could touch me; I
could snap my fingers, live as I wished&mdash;enjoy myself!' No!
One could not live as he had and just drop it all&mdash;settle down
in Capua, to spend the money and reputation he had made. A man's
life was what he possessed and sought to possess. Only fools
thought otherwise&mdash;fools, and socialists, and libertines!</p>

<p>The cab was passing villas now, going a great pace. 'Fifteen
miles an hour, I should think!' he mused; 'this'll take people out
of town to live!' and he thought of its bearing on the portions of
London owned by his father&mdash;he himself had never taken to that
form of investment, the gambler in him having all the outlet needed
in his pictures. And the cab sped on, down the hill past Wimbledon
Common. This interview! Surely a man of fifty-two with grown-up
children, and hung on the line, would not be reckless. 'He won't
want to disgrace the family,' he thought; 'he was as fond of his
father as I am of mine, and they were brothers. That woman brings
destruction&mdash;what is it in her? I've never known.' The cab
branched off, along the side of a wood, and he heard a late cuckoo
calling, almost the first he had heard that year. He was now almost
opposite the site he had originally chosen for his house, and which
had been so unceremoniously rejected by Bosinney in favour of his
own choice. He began passing his handkerchief over his face and
hands, taking deep breaths to give him steadiness. 'Keep one's
head,' he thought, 'keep one's head!'</p>

<p>The cab turned in at the drive which might have been his own,
and the sound of music met him. He had forgotten the fellow's
daughters.</p>

<p>"I may be out again directly," he said to the driver, "or I may
be kept some time"; and he rang the bell.</p>

<p>Following the maid through the curtains into the inner hall, he
felt relieved that the impact of this meeting would be broken by
June or Holly, whichever was playing in there, so that with
complete surprise he saw Irene at the piano, and Jolyon sitting in
an armchair listening. They both stood up. Blood surged into
Soames' brain, and all his resolution to be guided by this or that
left him utterly. The look of his farmer forbears&mdash;dogged
Forsytes down by the sea, from 'Superior Dosset' back&mdash;grinned
out of his face.</p>

<p>"Very pretty!" he said.</p>

<p>He heard the fellow murmur:</p>

<p>"This is hardly the place&mdash;we'll go to the study, if you
don't mind." And they both passed him through the curtain opening.
In the little room to which he followed them, Irene stood by the
open window, and the 'fellow' close to her by a big chair. Soames
pulled the door to behind him with a slam; the sound carried him
back all those years to the day when he had shut out
Jolyon&mdash;shut him out for meddling with his affairs.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "what have you to say for yourselves?"</p>

<p>The fellow had the effrontery to smile.</p>

<p>"What we have received to-day has taken away your right to ask.
I should imagine you will be glad to have your neck out of
chancery."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Soames; "you think so! I came to tell you that I'll
divorce her with every circumstance of disgrace to you both, unless
you swear to keep clear of each other from now on."</p>

<p>He was astonished at his fluency, because his mind was
stammering and his hands twitching. Neither of them answered; but
their faces seemed to him as if contemptuous.</p>

<p>"Well," he said; "you&mdash;Irene?"</p>

<p>Her lips moved, but Jolyon laid his hand on her arm.</p>

<p>"Let her alone!" said Soames furiously. "Irene, will you swear
it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Oh! and you?"</p>

<p>"Still less."</p>

<p>"So then you're guilty, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, guilty." It was Irene speaking in that serene voice, with
that unreached air which had maddened him so often; and, carried
beyond himself, he cried:</p>

<p>"You are a devil"</p>

<p>"Go out! Leave this house, or I'll do you an injury."</p>

<p>That fellow to talk of injuries! Did he know how near his throat
was to being scragged?</p>

<p>"A trustee," he said, "embezzling trust property! A thief,
stealing his cousin's wife."</p>

<p>"Call me what you like. You have chosen your part, we have
chosen ours. Go out!"</p>

<p>If he had brought a weapon Soames might have used it at that
moment.</p>

<p>"I'll make you pay!" he said.</p>

<p>"I shall be very happy."</p>

<p>At that deadly turning of the meaning of his speech by the son
of him who had nicknamed him 'the man of property,' Soames stood
glaring. It was ridiculous!</p>

<p>There they were, kept from violence by some secret force. No
blow possible, no words to meet the case. But he could not, did not
know how to turn and go away. His eyes fastened on Irene's
face&mdash;the last time he would ever see that fatal
face&mdash;the last time, no doubt!</p>

<p>"You," he said suddenly, "I hope you'll treat him as you treated
me&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>He saw her wince, and with a sensation not quite triumph, not
quite relief, he wrenched open the door, passed out through the
hall, and got into his cab. He lolled against the cushion with his
eyes shut. Never in his life had he been so near to murderous
violence, never so thrown away the restraint which was his second
nature. He had a stripped and naked feeling, as if all virtue had
gone out of him&mdash;life meaningless, mind-striking work.
Sunlight streamed in on him, but he felt cold. The scene he had
passed through had gone from him already, what was before him would
not materialise, he could catch on to nothing; and he felt
frightened, as if he had been hanging over the edge of a precipice,
as if with another turn of the screw sanity would have failed him.
'I'm not fit for it,' he thought; 'I mustn't&mdash;I'm not fit for
it.' The cab sped on, and in mechanical procession trees, houses,
people passed, but had no significance. 'I feel very queer,' he
thought; 'I'll take a Turkish bath.&mdash;I've been very near to
something. It won't do.' The cab whirred its way back over the
bridge, up the Fulham Road, along the Park.</p>

<p>"To the Hammam," said Soames.</p>

<p>Curious that on so warm a summer day, heat should be so
comforting! Crossing into the hot room he met George Forsyte coming
out, red and glistening.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said George; "what are you training for? You've not got
much superfluous."</p>

<p>Buffoon! Soames passed him with his sideway smile. Lying back,
rubbing his skin uneasily for the first signs of perspiration, he
thought: 'Let them laugh! I won't feel anything! I can't stand
violence! It's not good for me!'</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER VII&mdash;A SUMMER NIGHT</h3>

<p>Soames left dead silence in the little study. "Thank you for
that good lie," said Jolyon suddenly. "Come out&mdash;the air in
here is not what it was!"</p>

<p>In front of a long high southerly wall on which were trained
peach-trees the two walked up and down in silence. Old Jolyon had
planted some cupressus-trees, at intervals, between this grassy
terrace and the dipping meadow full of buttercups and ox-eyed
daisies; for twelve years they had flourished, till their dark
spiral shapes had quite a look of Italy. Birds fluttered softly in
the wet shrubbery; the swallows swooped past, with a steel-blue
sheen on their swift little bodies; the grass felt springy beneath
the feet, its green refreshed; butterflies chased each other. After
that painful scene the quiet of Nature was wonderfully poignant.
Under the sun-soaked wall ran a narrow strip of garden-bed full of
mignonette and pansies, and from the bees came a low hum in which
all other sounds were set&mdash;the mooing of a cow deprived of her
calf, the calling of a cuckoo from an elm-tree at the bottom of the
meadow. Who would have thought that behind them, within ten miles,
London began&mdash;that London of the Forsytes, with its wealth,
its misery; its dirt and noise; its jumbled stone isles of beauty,
its grey sea of hideous brick and stucco? That London which had
seen Irene's early tragedy, and Jolyon's own hard days; that web;
that princely workhouse of the possessive instinct!</p>

<p>And while they walked Jolyon pondered those words: 'I hope
you'll treat him as you treated me.' That would depend on himself.
Could he trust himself? Did Nature permit a Forsyte not to make a
slave of what he adored? Could beauty be confided to him? Or should
she not be just a visitor, coming when she would, possessed for
moments which passed, to return only at her own choosing? 'We are a
breed of spoilers!' thought Jolyon, 'close and greedy; the bloom of
life is not safe with us. Let her come to me as she will, when she
will, not at all if she will not. Let me be just her stand-by, her
perching-place; never-never her cage!'</p>

<p>She was the chink of beauty in his dream. Was he to pass through
the curtains now and reach her? Was the rich stuff of many
possessions, the close encircling fabric of the possessive instinct
walling in that little black figure of himself, and
Soames&mdash;was it to be rent so that he could pass through into
his vision, find there something not of the senses only? 'Let me,'
he thought, 'ah! let me only know how not to grasp and
destroy!'</p>

<p>But at dinner there were plans to be made. To-night she would go
back to the hotel, but tomorrow he would take her up to London. He
must instruct his solicitor&mdash;Jack Herring. Not a finger must
be raised to hinder the process of the Law. Damages exemplary,
judicial strictures, costs, what they liked&mdash;let it go through
at the first moment, so that her neck might be out of chancery at
last! To-morrow he would see Herring&mdash;they would go and see
him together. And then&mdash;abroad, leaving no doubt, no
difficulty about evidence, making the lie she had told into the
truth. He looked round at her; and it seemed to his adoring eyes
that more than a woman was sitting there. The spirit of universal
beauty, deep, mysterious, which the old painters, Titian,
Giorgione, Botticelli, had known how to capture and transfer to the
faces of their women&mdash;this flying beauty seemed to him
imprinted on her brow, her hair, her lips, and in her eyes.</p>

<p>'And this is to be mine!' he thought. 'It frightens me!'</p>

<p>After dinner they went out on to the terrace to have coffee.
They sat there long, the evening was so lovely, watching the summer
night come very slowly on. It was still warm and the air smelled of
lime blossom&mdash;early this summer. Two bats were flighting with
the faint mysterious little noise they make. He had placed the
chairs in front of the study window, and moths flew past to visit
the discreet light in there. There was no wind, and not a whisper
in the old oak-tree twenty yards away! The moon rose from behind
the copse, nearly full; and the two lights struggled, till
moonlight conquered, changing the colour and quality of all the
garden, stealing along the flagstones, reaching their feet,
climbing up, changing their faces.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jolyon at last, "you'll be tired, dear; we'd better
start. The maid will show you Holly's room," and he rang the study
bell. The maid who came handed him a telegram. Watching her take
Irene away, he thought: 'This must have come an hour or more ago,
and she didn't bring it out to us! That shows! Well, we'll be hung
for a sheep soon!' And, opening the telegram, he read:</p>

<p>"JOLYON FORSYTE, Robin Hill.&mdash;Your son passed painlessly
away on June 20th. Deep sympathy"&mdash;some name unknown to
him.</p>

<p>He dropped it, spun round, stood motionless. The moon shone in
on him; a moth flew in his face. The first day of all that he had
not thought almost ceaselessly of Jolly. He went blindly towards
the window, struck against the old armchair&mdash;his
father's&mdash;and sank down on to the arm of it. He sat there
huddled' forward, staring into the night. Gone out like a candle
flame; far from home, from love, all by himself, in the dark! His
boy! From a little chap always so good to him&mdash;so friendly!
Twenty years old, and cut down like grass&mdash;to have no life at
all! 'I didn't really know him,' he thought, 'and he didn't know
me; but we loved each other. It's only love that matters.'</p>

<p>To die out there&mdash;lonely&mdash;wanting them&mdash;wanting
home! This seemed to his Forsyte heart more painful, more pitiful
than death itself. No shelter, no protection, no love at the last!
And all the deeply rooted clanship in him, the family feeling and
essential clinging to his own flesh and blood which had been so
strong in old Jolyon was so strong in all the Forsytes&mdash;felt
outraged, cut, and torn by his boy's lonely passing. Better far if
he had died in battle, without time to long for them to come to
him, to call out for them, perhaps, in his delirium!</p>

<p>The moon had passed behind the oak-tree now, endowing it with
uncanny life, so that it seemed watching him&mdash;the oak-tree his
boy had been so fond of climbing, out of which he had once fallen
and hurt himself, and hadn't cried!</p>

<p>The door creaked. He saw Irene come in, pick up the telegram and
read it. He heard the faint rustle of her dress. She sank on her
knees close to him, and he forced himself to smile at her. She
stretched up her arms and drew his head down on her shoulder. The
perfume and warmth of her encircled him; her presence gained slowly
his whole being.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;JAMES IN WAITING</h3>

<p>Sweated to serenity, Soames dined at the Remove and turned his
face toward Park Lane. His father had been unwell lately. This
would have to be kept from him! Never till that moment had he
realised how much the dread of bringing James' grey hairs down with
sorrow to the grave had counted with him; how intimately it was
bound up with his own shrinking from scandal. His affection for his
father, always deep, had increased of late years with the knowledge
that James looked on him as the real prop of his decline. It seemed
pitiful that one who had been so careful all his life and done so
much for the family name&mdash;so that it was almost a byword for
solid, wealthy respectability&mdash;should at his last gasp have to
see it in all the newspapers. This was like lending a hand to
Death, that final enemy of Forsytes. 'I must tell mother,' he
thought, 'and when it comes on, we must keep the papers from him
somehow. He sees hardly anyone.' Letting himself in with his
latchkey, he was beginning to ascend he stairs when he became
conscious of commotion on the second-floor landing. His mother's
voice was saying:</p>

<p>"Now, James, you'll catch cold. Why can't you wait quietly?"</p>

<p>His father's answering</p>

<p>"Wait? I'm always waiting. Why doesn't he come in?"</p>

<p>"You can speak to him to-morrow morning, instead of making a guy
of yourself on the landing."</p>

<p>"He'll go up to bed, I shouldn't wonder. I shan't sleep."</p>

<p>"Now come back to bed, James."</p>

<p>"Um! I might die before to-morrow morning for all you can
tell."</p>

<p>"You shan't have to wait till to-morrow morning; I'll go down
and bring him up. Don't fuss!"</p>

<p>"There you go&mdash;always so cock-a-hoop. He mayn't come in at
all."</p>

<p>"Well, if he doesn't come in you won't catch him by standing out
here in your dressing-gown."</p>

<p>Soames rounded the last bend and came in sight of his father's
tall figure wrapped in a brown silk quilted gown, stooping over the
balustrade above. Light fell on his silvery hair and whiskers,
investing his head with, a sort of halo.</p>

<p>"Here he is!" he heard him say in a voice which sounded injured,
and his mother's comfortable answer from the bedroom door:</p>

<p>"That's all right. Come in, and I'll brush your hair." James
extended a thin, crooked finger, oddly like the beckoning of a
skeleton, and passed through the doorway of his bedroom.</p>

<p>'What is it?' thought Soames. 'What has he got hold of now?'</p>

<p>His father was sitting before the dressing-table sideways to the
mirror, while Emily slowly passed two silver-backed brushes through
and through his hair. She would do this several times a day, for it
had on him something of the effect produced on a cat by scratching
between its ears.</p>

<p>"There you are!" he said. "I've been waiting."</p>

<p>Soames stroked his shoulder, and, taking up a silver
button-hook, examined the mark on it.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "you're looking better."</p>

<p>James shook his head.</p>

<p>"I want to say something. Your mother hasn't heard." He
announced Emily's ignorance of what he hadn't told her, as if it
were a grievance.</p>

<p>"Your father's been in a great state all the evening. I'm sure I
don't know what about."</p>

<p>The faint 'whisk-whisk' of the brushes continued the soothing of
her voice.</p>

<p>"No! you know nothing," said James. "Soames can tell me." And,
fixing his grey eyes, in which there was a look of strain,
uncomfortable to watch, on his son, he muttered:</p>

<p>"I'm getting on, Soames. At my age I can't tell. I might die any
time. There'll be a lot of money. There's Rachel and Cicely got no
children; and Val's out there&mdash;that chap his father will get
hold of all he can. And somebody'll pick up Imogen, I shouldn't
wonder."</p>

<p>Soames listened vaguely&mdash;he had heard all this before.
Whish-whish! went the brushes.</p>

<p>"If that's all!" said Emily.</p>

<p>"All!" cried James; "it's nothing. I'm coming to that." And
again his eyes strained pitifully at Soames.</p>

<p>"It's you, my boy," he said suddenly; "you ought to get a
divorce."</p>

<p>That word, from those of all lips, was almost too much for
Soames' composure. His eyes reconcentrated themselves quickly on
the buttonhook, and as if in apology James hurried on:</p>

<p>"I don't know what's become of her&mdash;they say she's abroad.
Your Uncle Swithin used to admire her&mdash;he was a funny fellow."
(So he always alluded to his dead twin-'The Stout and the Lean of
it,' they had been called.) "She wouldn't be alone, I should say."
And with that summing-up of the effect of beauty on human nature,
he was silent, watching his son with eyes doubting as a bird's.
Soames, too, was silent. Whish-whish went the brushes.</p>

<p>"Come, James! Soames knows best. It's his 'business."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said James, and the word came from deep down; "but there's
all my money, and there's his&mdash;who's it to go to? And when he
dies the name goes out."</p>

<p>Soames replaced the button-hook on the lace and pink silk of the
dressing-table coverlet.</p>

<p>"The name?" said Emily, "there are all the other Forsytes."</p>

<p>"As if that helped me," muttered James. "I shall be in my grave,
and there'll be nobody, unless he marries again."</p>

<p>"You're quite right," said Soames quietly; "I'm getting a
divorce."</p>

<p>James' eyes almost started from his head.</p>

<p>"What?" he cried. "There! nobody tells me anything."</p>

<p>"Well," said Emily, "who would have imagined you wanted it? My
dear boy, that is a surprise, after all these years."</p>

<p>"It'll be a scandal," muttered James, as if to himself; "but I
can't help that. Don't brush so hard. When'll it come on?"</p>

<p>"Before the Long Vacation; it's not defended."</p>

<p>James' lips moved in secret calculation. "I shan't live to see
my grandson," he muttered.</p>

<p>Emily ceased brushing. "Of course you will, James. Soames will
be as quick as he can."</p>

<p>There was a long silence, till James reached out his arm.</p>

<p>"Here! let's have the eau-de-Cologne," and, putting it to his
nose, he moved his forehead in the direction of his son. Soames
bent over and kissed that brow just where the hair began. A
relaxing quiver passed over James' face, as though the wheels of
anxiety within were running down.</p>

<p>"I'll get to bed," he said; "I shan't want to see the papers
when that comes. They're a morbid lot; I can't pay attention to
them, I'm too old."</p>

<p>Queerly affected, Soames went to the door; he heard his father
say:</p>

<p>"Here, I'm tired. I'll say a prayer in bed."</p>

<p>And his mother answering</p>

<p>"That's right, James; it'll be ever so much more comfy."</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER IX&mdash;OUT OF THE WEB</h3>

<p>On Forsyte 'Change the announcement of Jolly's death, among a
batch of troopers, caused mixed sensation. Strange to read that
Jolyon Forsyte (fifth of the name in direct descent) had died of
disease in the service of his country, and not be able to feel it
personally. It revived the old grudge against his father for having
estranged himself. For such was still the prestige of old Jolyon
that the other Forsytes could never quite feel, as might have been
expected, that it was they who had cut off his descendants for
irregularity. The news increased, of course, the interest and
anxiety about Val; but then Val's name was Dartie, and even if he
were killed in battle or got the Victoria Cross, it would not be at
all the same as if his name were Forsyte. Not even casualty or
glory to the Haymans would be really satisfactory. Family pride
felt defrauded.</p>

<p>How the rumour arose, then, that 'something very dreadful, my
dear,' was pending, no one, least of all Soames, could tell, secret
as he kept everything. Possibly some eye had seen 'Forsyte v.
Forsyte and Forsyte,' in the cause list; and had added it to 'Irene
in Paris with a fair beard.' Possibly some wall at Park Lane had
ears. The fact remained that it was known&mdash;whispered among the
old, discussed among the young&mdash;that family pride must soon
receive a blow.</p>

<p>Soames, paying one, of his Sunday visits to
Timothy's&mdash;paying it with the feeling that after the suit came
on he would be paying no more&mdash;felt knowledge in the air as he
came in. Nobody, of course, dared speak of it before him, but each
of the four other Forsytes present held their breath, aware that
nothing could prevent Aunt Juley from making them all
uncomfortable. She looked so piteously at Soames, she checked
herself on the point of speech so often, that Aunt Hester excused
herself and said she must go and bathe Timothy's eye&mdash;he had a
sty coming. Soames, impassive, slightly supercilious, did not stay
long. He went out with a curse stifled behind his pale, just
smiling lips.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the peace of his mind, cruelly tortured by the
coming scandal, he was kept busy day and night with plans for his
retirement&mdash;for he had come to that grim conclusion. To go on
seeing all those people who had known him as a 'long-headed chap,'
an astute adviser&mdash;after that&mdash;no! The fastidiousness and
pride which was so strangely, so inextricably blended in him with
possessive obtuseness, revolted against the thought. He would
retire, live privately, go on buying pictures, make a great name as
a collector&mdash;after all, his heart was more in that than it had
ever been in Law. In pursuance of this now fixed resolve, he had to
get ready to amalgamate his business with another firm without
letting people know, for that would excite curiosity and make
humiliation cast its shadow before. He had pitched on the firm of
Cuthcott, Holliday and Kingson, two of whom were dead. The full
name after the amalgamation would therefore be Cuthcott, Holliday,
Kingson, Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte. But after debate as to which
of the dead still had any influence with the living, it was decided
to reduce the title to Cuthcott, Kingson and Forsyte, of whom
Kingson would be the active and Soames the sleeping partner. For
leaving his name, prestige, and clients behind him, Soames would
receive considerable value.</p>

<p>One night, as befitted a man who had arrived at so important a
stage of his career, he made a calculation of what he was worth,
and after writing off liberally for depreciation by the war, found
his value to be some hundred and thirty thousand pounds. At his
father's death, which could not, alas, be delayed much longer, he
must come into at least another fifty thousand, and his yearly
expenditure at present just reached two. Standing among his
pictures, he saw before him a future full of bargains earned by the
trained faculty of knowing better than other people. Selling what
was about to decline, keeping what was still going up, and
exercising judicious insight into future taste, he would make a
unique collection, which at his death would pass to the nation
under the title 'Forsyte Bequest.'</p>

<p>If the divorce went through, he had determined on his line with
Madame Lamotte. She had, he knew, but one real ambition&mdash;to
live on her 'renter' in Paris near her grandchildren. He would buy
the goodwill of the Restaurant Bretagne at a fancy price. Madame
would live like a Queen-Mother in Paris on the interest, invested
as she would know how. (Incidentally Soames meant to put a capable
manager in her place, and make the restaurant pay good interest on
his money. There were great possibilities in Soho.) On Annette he
would promise to settle fifteen thousand pounds (whether designedly
or not), precisely the sum old Jolyon had settled on 'that
woman.'</p>

<p>A letter from Jolyon's solicitor to his own had disclosed the
fact that 'those two' were in Italy. And an opportunity had been
duly given for noting that they had first stayed at an hotel in
London. The matter was clear as daylight, and would be disposed of
in half an hour or so; but during that half-hour he, Soames, would
go down to hell; and after that half-hour all bearers of the
Forsyte name would feel the bloom was off the rose. He had no
illusions like Shakespeare that roses by any other name would smell
as sweet. The name was a possession, a concrete, unstained piece of
property, the value of which would be reduced some twenty per cent.
at least. Unless it were Roger, who had once refused to stand for
Parliament, and&mdash;oh, irony!&mdash;Jolyon, hung on the line,
there had never been a distinguished Forsyte. But that very lack of
distinction was the name's greatest asset. It was a private name,
intensely individual, and his own property; it had never been
exploited for good or evil by intrusive report. He and each member
of his family owned it wholly, sanely, secretly, without any more
interference from the public than had been necessitated by their
births, their marriages, their deaths. And during these weeks of
waiting and preparing to drop the Law, he conceived for that Law a
bitter distaste, so deeply did he resent its coming violation of
his name, forced on him by the need he felt to perpetuate that name
in a lawful manner. The monstrous injustice of the whole thing
excited in him a perpetual suppressed fury. He had asked no better
than to live in spotless domesticity, and now he must go into the
witness box, after all these futile, barren years, and proclaim his
failure to keep his wife&mdash;incur the pity, the amusement, the
contempt of his kind. It was all upside down. She and that fellow
ought to be the sufferers, and they&mdash;were in Italy! In these
weeks the Law he had served so faithfully, looked on so reverently
as the guardian of all property, seemed to him quite pitiful. What
could be more insane than to tell a man that he owned his wife, and
punish him when someone unlawfully took her away from him? Did the
Law not know that a man's name was to him the apple of his eye,
that it was far harder to be regarded as cuckold than as seducer?
He actually envied Jolyon the reputation of succeeding where he,
Soames, had failed. The question of damages worried him, too. He
wanted to make that fellow suffer, but he remembered his cousin's
words, "I shall be very happy," with the uneasy feeling that to
claim damages would make not Jolyon but himself suffer; he felt
uncannily that Jolyon would rather like to pay them&mdash;the chap
was so loose. Besides, to claim damages was not the thing to do.
The claim, indeed, had been made almost mechanically; and as the
hour drew near Soames saw in it just another dodge of this
insensitive and topsy-turvy Law to make him ridiculous; so that
people might sneer and say: "Oh, yes, he got quite a good price for
her!" And he gave instructions that his Counsel should state that
the money would be given to a Home for Fallen Women. He was a long
time hitting off exactly the right charity; but, having pitched on
it, he used to wake up in the night and think: 'It won't do, too
lurid; it'll draw attention. Something quieter&mdash;better taste.'
He did not care for dogs, or he would have named them; and it was
in desperation at last&mdash;for his knowledge of charities was
limited&mdash;that he decided on the blind. That could not be
inappropriate, and it would make the Jury assess the damages
high.</p>

<p>A good many suits were dropping out of the list, which happened
to be exceptionally thin that summer, so that his case would be
reached before August. As the day grew nearer, Winifred was his
only comfort. She showed the fellow-feeling of one who had been
through the mill, and was the 'femme-sole' in whom he confided,
well knowing that she would not let Dartie into her confidence.
That ruffian would be only too rejoiced! At the end of July, on the
afternoon before the case, he went in to see her. They had not yet
been able to leave town, because Dartie had already spent their
summer holiday, and Winifred dared not go to her father for more
money while he was waiting not to be told anything about this
affair of Soames.</p>

<p>Soames found her with a letter in her hand.</p>

<p>"That from Val," he asked gloomily. "What does he say?"</p>

<p>"He says he's married," said Winifred.</p>

<p>"Whom to, for Goodness' sake?"</p>

<p>Winifred looked up at him.</p>

<p>"To Holly Forsyte, Jolyon's daughter."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"He got leave and did it. I didn't even know he knew her.
Awkward, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Soames uttered a short laugh at that characteristic
minimisation.</p>

<p>"Awkward! Well, I don't suppose they'll hear about this till
they come back. They'd better stay out there. That fellow will give
her money."</p>

<p>"But I want Val back," said Winifred almost piteously; "I miss
him, he helps me to get on."</p>

<p>"I know," murmured Soames. "How's Dartie behaving now?"</p>

<p>"It might be worse; but it's always money. Would you like me to
come down to the Court to-morrow, Soames?"</p>

<p>Soames stretched out his hand for hers. The gesture so betrayed
the loneliness in him that she pressed it between her two.</p>

<p>"Never mind, old boy. You'll feel ever so much better when it's
all over."</p>

<p>"I don't know what I've done," said Soames huskily; "I never
have. It's all upside down. I was fond of her; I've always
been."</p>

<p>Winifred saw a drop of blood ooze out of his lip, and the sight
stirred her profoundly.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, "it's been too bad of her all along! But
what shall I do about this marriage of Val's, Soames? I don't know
how to write to him, with this coming on. You've seen that child.
Is she pretty?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she's pretty," said Soames. "Dark&mdash;lady-like
enough."</p>

<p>'That doesn't sound so bad,' thought Winifred. 'Jolyon had
style.'</p>

<p>"It is a coil," she said. "What will father say?</p>

<p>"Mustn't be told," said Soames. "The war'll soon be over now,
you'd better let Val take to farming out there."</p>

<p>It was tantamount to saying that his nephew was lost.</p>

<p>"I haven't told Monty," Winifred murmured desolately.</p>

<p>The case was reached before noon next day, and was over in
little more than half an hour. Soames&mdash;pale, spruce, sad-eyed
in the witness-box&mdash;had suffered so much beforehand that he
took it all like one dead. The moment the decree nisi was
pronounced he left the Courts of Justice.</p>

<p>Four hours until he became public property! 'Solicitor's divorce
suit!' A surly, dogged anger replaced that dead feeling within him.
'Damn them all!' he thought; 'I won't run away. I'll act as if
nothing had happened.' And in the sweltering heat of Fleet Street
and Ludgate Hill he walked all the way to his City Club, lunched,
and went back to his office. He worked there stolidly throughout
the afternoon.</p>

<p>On his way out he saw that his clerks knew, and answered their
involuntary glances with a look so sardonic that they were
immediately withdrawn. In front of St. Paul's, he stopped to buy
the most gentlemanly of the evening papers. Yes! there he was!
'Well-known solicitor's divorce. Cousin co-respondent. Damages
given to the blind'&mdash;so, they had got that in! At every other
face, he thought: 'I wonder if you know!' And suddenly he felt
queer, as if something were racing round in his head.</p>

<p>What was this? He was letting it get hold of him! He mustn't! He
would be ill. He mustn't think! He would get down to the river and
row about, and fish. 'I'm not going to be laid up,' he thought.</p>

<p>It flashed across him that he had something of importance to do
before he went out of town. Madame Lamotte! He must explain the
Law. Another six months before he was really free! Only he did not
want to see Annette! And he passed his hand over the top of his
head&mdash;it was very hot.</p>

<p>He branched off through Covent Garden. On this sultry day of
late July the garbage-tainted air of the old market offended him,
and Soho seemed more than ever the disenchanted home of
rapscallionism. Alone, the Restaurant Bretagne, neat, daintily
painted, with its blue tubs and the dwarf trees therein, retained
an aloof and Frenchified self-respect. It was the slack hour, and
pale trim waitresses were preparing the little tables for dinner.
Soames went through into the private part. To his discomfiture
Annette answered his knock. She, too, looked pale and dragged down
by the heat.</p>

<p>"You are quite a stranger," she said languidly.</p>

<p>Soames smiled.</p>

<p>"I haven't wished to be; I've been busy."</p>

<p>"Where's your mother, Annette? I've got some news for her."</p>

<p>"Mother is not in."</p>

<p>It seemed to Soames that she looked at him in a queer way. What
did she know? How much had her mother told her? The worry of trying
to make that out gave him an alarming feeling in the head. He
gripped the edge of the table, and dizzily saw Annette come
forward, her eyes clear with surprise. He shut his own and
said:</p>

<p>"It's all right. I've had a touch of the sun, I think." The sun!
What he had was a touch of 'darkness! Annette's voice, French and
composed, said:</p>

<p>"Sit down, it will pass, then." Her hand pressed his shoulder,
and Soames sank into a chair. When the dark feeling dispersed, and
he opened his eyes, she was looking down at him. What an
inscrutable and odd expression for a girl of twenty!</p>

<p>"Do you feel better?"</p>

<p>"It's nothing," said Soames. Instinct told him that to be feeble
before her was not helping him&mdash;age was enough handicap
without that. Will-power was his fortune with Annette, he had lost
ground these latter months from indecision&mdash;he could not
afford to lose any more. He got up, and said:</p>

<p>"I'll write to your mother. I'm going down to my river house for
a long holiday. I want you both to come there presently and stay.
It's just at its best. You will, won't you?"</p>

<p>"It will be veree nice." A pretty little roll of that 'r' but no
enthusiasm. And rather sadly he added:</p>

<p>"You're feeling the heat; too, aren't you, Annette? It'll do you
good to be on the river. Good-night." Annette swayed forward. There
was a sort of compunction in the movement.</p>

<p>"Are you fit to go? Shall I give you some coffee?"</p>

<p>"No," said Soames firmly. "Give me your hand."</p>

<p>She held out her hand, and Soames raised it to his lips. When he
looked up, her face wore again that strange expression. 'I can't
tell,' he thought, as he went out; 'but I mustn't think&mdash;I
mustn't worry:</p>

<p>But worry he did, walking toward Pall Mall. English, not of her
religion, middle-aged, scarred as it were by domestic tragedy, what
had he to give her? Only wealth, social position, leisure,
admiration! It was much, but was it enough for a beautiful girl of
twenty? He felt so ignorant about Annette. He had, too, a curious
fear of the French nature of her mother and herself. They knew so
well what they wanted. They were almost Forsytes. They would never
grasp a shadow and miss a substance.</p>

<p>The tremendous effort it was to write a simple note to Madame
Lamotte when he reached his Club warned him still further that he
was at the end of his tether.</p>

<blockquote>"MY DEAR MADAME (he said),<br>
<br>
"You will see by the enclosed newspaper cutting that I obtained my
decree of divorce to-day. By the English Law I shall not, however,
be free to marry again till the decree is confirmed six months
hence. In the meanwhile I have the honor to ask to be considered a
formal suitor for the hand of your daughter. I shall write again in
a few days and beg you both to come and stay at my river house.<br>
<br>
"I am, dear Madame,<br>
"Sincerely yours,<br>
"SOAMES FORSYTE."</blockquote>

<p>Having sealed and posted this letter, he went into the
dining-room. Three mouthfuls of soup convinced him that he could
not eat; and, causing a cab to be summoned, he drove to Paddington
Station and took the first train to Reading. He reached his house
just as the sun went down, and wandered out on to the lawn. The air
was drenched with the scent of pinks and picotees in his
flower-borders. A stealing coolness came off the river.</p>

<p>Rest-peace! Let a poor fellow rest! Let not worry and shame and
anger chase like evil night-birds in his head! Like those doves
perched half-sleeping on their dovecot, like the furry creatures in
the woods on the far side, and the simple folk in their cottages,
like the trees and the river itself, whitening fast in twilight,
like the darkening cornflower-blue sky where stars were coming
up&mdash;let him cease from himself, and rest!</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER X&mdash;PASSING OF AN AGE</h3>

<p>The marriage of Soames with Annette took place in Paris on the
last day of January, 1901, with such privacy that not even Emily
was told until it was accomplished.</p>

<p>The day after the wedding he brought her to one of those quiet
hotels in London where greater expense can be incurred for less
result than anywhere else under heaven. Her beauty in the best
Parisian frocks was giving him more satisfaction than if he had
collected a perfect bit of china, or a jewel of a picture; he
looked forward to the moment when he would exhibit her in Park
Lane, in Green Street, and at Timothy's.</p>

<p>If some one had asked him in those days, "In
confidence&mdash;are you in love with this girl?" he would have
replied: "In love? What is love? If you mean do I feel to her as I
did towards Irene in those old days when I first met her and she
would not have me; when I sighed and starved after her and couldn't
rest a minute until she yielded&mdash;no! If you mean do I admire
her youth and prettiness, do my senses ache a little when I see her
moving about&mdash;yes! Do I think she will keep me straight, make
me a creditable wife and a good mother for my
children?&mdash;again, yes!"</p>

<p>"What more do I need? and what more do three-quarters of the
women who are married get from the men who marry them?" And if the
enquirer had pursued his query, "And do you think it was fair to
have tempted this girl to give herself to you for life unless you
have really touched her heart?" he would have answered: "The French
see these things differently from us. They look at marriage from
the point of view of establishments and children; and, from my own
experience, I am not at all sure that theirs is not the sensible
view. I shall not expect this time more than I can get, or she can
give. Years hence I shouldn't be surprised if I have trouble with
her; but I shall be getting old, I shall have children by then. I
shall shut my eyes. I have had my great passion; hers is perhaps to
come&mdash;I don't suppose it will be for me. I offer her a great
deal, and I don't expect much in return, except children, or at
least a son. But one thing I am sure of&mdash;she has very good
sense!"</p>

<p>And if, insatiate, the enquirer had gone on, "You do not look,
then, for spiritual union in this marriage?" Soames would have
lifted his sideway smile, and rejoined: "That's as it may be. If I
get satisfaction for my senses, perpetuation of myself; good taste
and good humour in the house; it is all I can expect at my age. I
am not likely to be going out of my way towards any far-fetched
sentimentalism." Whereon, the enquirer must in good taste have
ceased enquiry.</p>

<p>The Queen was dead, and the air of the greatest city upon earth
grey with unshed tears. Fur-coated and top-hatted, with Annette
beside him in dark furs, Soames crossed Park Lane on the morning of
the funeral procession, to the rails in Hyde Park. Little moved
though he ever was by public matters, this event, supremely
symbolical, this summing-up of a long rich period, impressed his
fancy. In '37, when she came to the throne, 'Superior Dosset' was
still building houses to make London hideous; and James, a
stripling of twenty-six, just laying the foundations of his
practice in the Law. Coaches still ran; men wore stocks, shaved
their upper lips, ate oysters out of barrels; 'tigers' swung behind
cabriolets; women said, 'La!' and owned no property; there were
manners in the land, and pigsties for the poor; unhappy devils were
hanged for little crimes, and Dickens had but just begun to write.
Well-nigh two generations had slipped by&mdash;of steamboats,
railways, telegraphs, bicycles, electric light, telephones, and now
these motorcars&mdash;of such accumulated wealth, that eight per
cent. had become three, and Forsytes were numbered by the thousand!
Morals had changed, manners had changed, men had become monkeys
twice-removed, God had become Mammon&mdash;Mammon so respectable as
to deceive himself: Sixty-four years that favoured property, and
had made the upper middle class; buttressed, chiselled, polished
it, till it was almost indistinguishable in manners, morals,
speech, appearance, habit, and soul from the nobility. An epoch
which had gilded individual liberty so that if a man had money, he
was free in law and fact, and if he had not money he was free in
law and not in fact. An era which had canonised hypocrisy, so that
to seem to be respectable was to be. A great Age, whose transmuting
influence nothing had escaped save the nature of man and the nature
of the Universe.</p>

<p>And to witness the passing of this Age, London&mdash;its pet and
fancy&mdash;was pouring forth her citizens through every gate into
Hyde Park, hub of Victorianism, happy hunting-ground of Forsytes.
Under the grey heavens, whose drizzle just kept off, the dark
concourse gathered to see the show. The 'good old' Queen, full of
years and virtue, had emerged from her seclusion for the last time
to make a London holiday. From Houndsditch, Acton, Ealing,
Hampstead, Islington, and Bethnal Green; from Hackney, Hornsey,
Leytonstone, Battersea, and Fulham; and from those green pastures
where Forsytes flourish&mdash;Mayfair and Kensington, St. James'
and Belgravia, Bayswater and Chelsea and the Regent's Park, the
people swarmed down on to the roads where death would presently
pass with dusky pomp and pageantry. Never again would a Queen reign
so long, or people have a chance to see so much history buried for
their money. A pity the war dragged on, and that the Wreath of
Victory could not be laid upon her coffin! All else would be there
to follow and commemorate&mdash;soldiers, sailors, foreign princes,
half-masted bunting, tolling bells, and above all the surging,
great, dark-coated crowd, with perhaps a simple sadness here and
there deep in hearts beneath black clothes put on by regulation.
After all, more than a Queen was going to her rest, a woman who had
braved sorrow, lived well and wisely according to her lights.</p>

<p>Out in the crowd against the railings, with his arm hooked in
Annette's, Soames waited. Yes! the Age was passing! What with this
Trade Unionism, and Labour fellows in the House of Commons, with
continental fiction, and something in the general feel of
everything, not to be expressed in words, things were very
different; he recalled the crowd on Mafeking night, and George
Forsyte saying: "They're all socialists, they want our goods." Like
James, Soames didn't know, he couldn't tell&mdash;with Edward on
the throne! Things would never be as safe again as under good old
Viccy! Convulsively he pressed his young wife's arm. There, at any
rate, was something substantially his own, domestically certain
again at last; something which made property worth while&mdash;a
real thing once more. Pressed close against her and trying to ward
others off, Soames was content. The crowd swayed round them, ate
sandwiches and dropped crumbs; boys who had climbed the plane-trees
chattered above like monkeys, threw twigs and orange-peel. It was
past time; they should be coming soon! And, suddenly, a little
behind them to the left, he saw a tallish man with a soft hat and
short grizzling beard, and a tallish woman in a little round fur
cap and veil. Jolyon and Irene talking, smiling at each other,
close together like Annette and himself! They had not seen him; and
stealthily, with a very queer feeling in his heart, Soames watched
those two. They looked happy! What had they come here
for&mdash;inherently illicit creatures, rebels from the Victorian
ideal? What business had they in this crowd? Each of them twice
exiled by morality&mdash;making a boast, as it were, of love and
laxity! He watched them fascinated; admitting grudgingly even with
his arm thrust through Annette's that&mdash;that
she&mdash;Irene&mdash;No! he would not admit it; and he turned his
eyes away. He would not see them, and let the old bitterness, the
old longing rise up within him! And then Annette turned to him and
said: "Those two people, Soames; they know you, I am sure. Who are
they?"</p>

<p>Soames nosed sideways.</p>

<p>"What people?"</p>

<p>"There, you see them; just turning away. They know you."</p>

<p>"No," Soames answered; "a mistake, my dear."</p>

<p>"A lovely face! And how she walk! Elle est tres distinguee!"</p>

<p>Soames looked then. Into his life, out of his life she had
walked like that swaying and erect, remote, unseizable; ever
eluding the contact of his soul! He turned abruptly from that
receding vision of the past.</p>

<p>"You'd better attend," he said, "they're coming now!"</p>

<p>But while he stood, grasping her arm, seemingly intent on the
head of the procession, he was quivering with the sense of always
missing something, with instinctive regret that he had not got them
both.</p>

<p>Slow came the music and the march, till, in silence, the long
line wound in through the Park gate. He heard Annette whisper, "How
sad it is and beautiful!" felt the clutch of her hand as she stood
up on tiptoe; and the crowd's emotion gripped him. There it
was&mdash;the bier of the Queen, coffin of the Age slow passing!
And as it went by there came a murmuring groan from all the long
line of those who watched, a sound such as Soames had never heard,
so unconscious, primitive, deep and wild, that neither he nor any
knew whether they had joined in uttering it. Strange sound, indeed!
Tribute of an Age to its own death...Ah! Ah!...The hold on life had
slipped. That which had seemed eternal was gone! The
Queen&mdash;God bless her!</p>

<p>It moved on with the bier, that travelling groan, as a fire
moves on over grass in a thin line; it kept step, and marched
alongside down the dense crowds mile after mile. It was a human
sound, and yet inhuman, pushed out by animal subconsciousness, by
intimate knowledge of universal death and change. None of
us&mdash;none of us can hold on for ever!</p>

<p>It left silence for a little&mdash;a very little time, till
tongues began, eager to retrieve interest in the show. Soames
lingered just long enough to gratify Annette, then took her out of
the Park to lunch at his father's in Park Lane...</p>

<p>James had spent the morning gazing out of his bedroom window.
The last show he would see, last of so many! So she was gone! Well,
she was getting an old woman. Swithin and he had seen her
crowned&mdash;slim slip of a girl, not so old as Imogen! She had
got very stout of late. Jolyon and he had seen her married to that
German chap, her husband&mdash;he had turned out all right before
he died, and left her with that son of his. And he remembered the
many evenings he and his brothers and their cronies had wagged
their heads over their wine and walnuts and that fellow in his
salad days. And now he had come to the throne. They said he had
steadied down&mdash;he didn't know&mdash;couldn't tell! He'd make
the money fly still, he shouldn't wonder. What a lot of people out
there! It didn't seem so very long since he and Swithin stood in
the crowd outside Westminster Abbey when she was crowned, and
Swithin had taken him to Cremorne afterwards&mdash;racketty chap,
Swithin; no, it didn't seem much longer ago than Jubilee Year, when
he had joined with Roger in renting a balcony in Piccadilly.</p>

<p>Jolyon, Swithin, Roger all gone, and he would be ninety in
August! And there was Soames married again to a French girl. The
French were a queer lot, but they made good mothers, he had heard.
Things changed! They said this German Emperor was here for the
funeral, his telegram to old Kruger had been in shocking taste. He
should not be surprised if that chap made trouble some day. Change!
H'm! Well, they must look after themselves when he was gone: he
didn't know where he'd be! And now Emily had asked Dartie to lunch,
with Winifred and Imogen, to meet Soames' wife&mdash;she was always
doing something. And there was Irene living with that fellow
Jolyon, they said. He'd marry her now, he supposed.</p>

<p>'My brother Jolyon,' he thought, 'what would he have said to it
all?' And somehow the utter impossibility of knowing what his elder
brother, once so looked up to, would have said, so worried James
that he got up from his chair by the window, and began slowly,
feebly to pace the room.</p>

<p>'She was a pretty thing, too,' he thought; 'I was fond of her.
Perhaps Soames didn't suit her&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I can't
tell. We never had any trouble with our wives.' Women had changed
everything had changed! And now the Queen was dead&mdash;well,
there it was! A movement in the crowd brought him to a standstill
at the window, his nose touching the pane and whitening from the
chill of it. They had got her as far as Hyde Park Corner&mdash;they
were passing now! Why didn't Emily come up here where she could
see, instead of fussing about lunch. He missed her at that
moment&mdash;missed her! Through the bare branches of the
plane-trees he could just see the procession, could see the hats
coming off the people's heads&mdash;a lot of them would catch
colds, he shouldn't wonder! A voice behind him said:</p>

<p>"You've got a capital view here, James!"</p>

<p>"There you are!" muttered James; "why didn't you come before?
You might have missed it!"</p>

<p>And he was silent, staring with all his might.</p>

<p>"What's the noise?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"There's no noise," returned Emily; "what are you thinking
of?&mdash;they wouldn't cheer."</p>

<p>"I can hear it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, James!"</p>

<p>No sound came through those double panes; what James heard was
the groaning in his own heart at sight of his Age passing.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever tell me where I'm buried," he said suddenly. "I
shan't want to know." And he turned from the window. There she
went, the old Queen; she'd had a lot of anxiety&mdash;she'd be glad
to be out of it, he should think!</p>

<p>Emily took up the hair-brushes.</p>

<p>"There'll be just time to brush your head," she said, "before
they come. You must look your best, James."</p>

<p>"Ah!" muttered James; "they say she's pretty."</p>

<p>The meeting with his new daughter-in-law took place in the
dining-room. James was seated by the fire when she was brought in.
He placed, his hands on the arms of the chair and slowly raised
himself. Stooping and immaculate in his frock-coat, thin as a line
in Euclid, he received Annette's hand in his; and the anxious eyes
of his furrowed face, which had lost its colour now, doubted above
her. A little warmth came into them and into his cheeks, refracted
from her bloom.</p>

<p>"How are you?" he said. "You've been to see the Queen, I
suppose? Did you have a good crossing?"</p>

<p>In this way he greeted her from whom he hoped for a grandson of
his name.</p>

<p>Gazing at him, so old, thin, white, and spotless, Annette
murmured something in French which James did not understand.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said, "you want your lunch, I expect. Soames,
ring the bell; we won't wait for that chap Dartie." But just then
they arrived. Dartie had refused to go out of his way to see 'the
old girl.' With an early cocktail beside him, he had taken a
'squint' from the smoking-room of the Iseeum, so that Winifred and
Imogen had been obliged to come back from the Park to fetch him
thence. His brown eyes rested on Annette with a stare of almost
startled satisfaction. The second beauty that fellow Soames had
picked up! What women could see in him! Well, she would play him
the same trick as the other, no doubt; but in the meantime he was a
lucky devil! And he brushed up his moustache, having in nine months
of Green Street domesticity regained almost all his flesh and his
assurance. Despite the comfortable efforts of Emily, Winifred's
composure, Imogen's enquiring friendliness, Dartie's showing-off,
and James' solicitude about her food, it was not, Soames felt, a
successful lunch for his bride. He took her away very soon.</p>

<p>"That Monsieur Dartie," said Annette in the cab, "je n'aime pas
ce type-la!"</p>

<p>"No, by George!" said Soames.</p>

<p>"Your sister is veree amiable, and the girl is pretty. Your
father is veree old. I think your mother has trouble with him; I
should not like to be her."</p>

<p>Soames nodded at the shrewdness, the clear hard judgment in his
young wife; but it disquieted him a little. The thought may have
just flashed through him, too: 'When I'm eighty she'll be
fifty-five, having trouble with me!'</p>

<p>"There's just one other house of my relations I must take you
to," he said; "you'll find it funny, but we must get it over; and
then we'll dine and go to the theatre."</p>

<p>In this way he prepared her for Timothy's. But Timothy's was
different. They were delighted to see dear Soames after this long
long time; and so this was Annette!</p>

<p>"You are so pretty, my dear; almost too young and pretty for
dear Soames, aren't you? But he's very attentive and
careful&mdash;such a good hush..." Aunt Juley checked herself, and
placed her lips just under each of Annette's eyes&mdash;she
afterwards described them to Francie, who dropped in, as:
"Cornflower-blue, so pretty, I quite wanted to kiss them. I must
say dear Soames is a perfect connoisseur. In her French way, and
not so very French either, I think she's as pretty&mdash;though not
so distinguished, not so alluring&mdash;as Irene. Because she was
alluring, wasn't she? with that white skin and those dark eyes, and
that hair, couleur de&mdash;what was it? I always forget."</p>

<p>"Feuille morte," Francie prompted.</p>

<p>"Of course, dead leaves&mdash;so strange. I remember when I was
a girl, before we came to London, we had a foxhound puppy&mdash;to
'walk' it was called then; it had a tan top to its head and a white
chest, and beautiful dark brown eyes, and it was a lady."</p>

<p>"Yes, auntie," said Francie, "but I don't see the
connection."</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied Aunt Juley, rather flustered, "it was so alluring,
and her eyes and hair, you know..." She was silent, as if surprised
in some indelicacy. "Feuille morte," she added suddenly;
"Hester&mdash;do remember that!"...</p>

<p>Considerable debate took place between the two sisters whether
Timothy should or should not be summoned to see Annette.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother!" said Soames.</p>

<p>"But it's no trouble, only of course Annette's being French
might upset him a little. He was so scared about Fashoda. I think
perhaps we had better not run the risk, Hester. It's nice to have
her all to ourselves, isn't it? And how are you, Soames? Have you
quite got over your..."</p>

<p>Hester interposed hurriedly:</p>

<p>"What do you think of London, Annette?"</p>

<p>Soames, disquieted, awaited the reply. It came, sensible,
composed: "Oh! I know London. I have visited before."</p>

<p>He had never ventured to speak to her on the subject of the
restaurant. The French had different notions about gentility, and
to shrink from connection with it might seem to her ridiculous; he
had waited to be married before mentioning it; and now he wished he
hadn't.</p>

<p>"And what part do you know best?" said Aunt Juley.</p>

<p>"Soho," said Annette simply.</p>

<p>Soames snapped his jaw.</p>

<p>"Soho?" repeated Aunt Juley; "Soho?"</p>

<p>'That'll go round the family,' thought Soames.</p>

<p>"It's very French, and interesting," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Aunt Juley, "your Uncle Roger had some houses
there once; he was always having to turn the tenants out, I
remember."</p>

<p>Soames changed the subject to Mapledurham.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Aunt Juley, "you will be going down there soon
to settle in. We are all so looking forward to the time when
Annette has a dear little..."</p>

<p>"Juley!" cried Aunt Hester desperately, "ring tea!"</p>

<p>Soames dared not wait for tea, and took Annette away.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't mention Soho if I were you," he said in the cab.
"It's rather a shady part of London; and you're altogether above
that restaurant business now; I mean," he added, "I want you to
know nice people, and the English are fearful snobs."</p>

<p>Annette's clear eyes opened; a little smile came on her
lips.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she said.</p>

<p>'H'm!' thought Soames, 'that's meant for me!' and he looked at
her hard. 'She's got good business instincts,' he thought. 'I must
make her grasp it once for all!'</p>

<p>"Look here, Annette! it's very simple, only it wants
understanding. Our professional and leisured classes still think
themselves a cut above our business classes, except of course the
very rich. It may be stupid, but there it is, you see. It isn't
advisable in England to let people know that you ran a restaurant
or kept a shop or were in any kind of trade. It may have been
extremely creditable, but it puts a sort of label on you; you don't
have such a good time, or meet such nice people&mdash;that's
all."</p>

<p>"I see," said Annette; "it is the same in France."</p>

<p>"Oh!" murmured Soames, at once relieved and taken aback. "Of
course, class is everything, really."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Annette; "comme vous etes sage."</p>

<p>'That's all right,' thought Soames, watching her lips, 'only
she's pretty cynical.' His knowledge of French was not yet such as
to make him grieve that she had not said 'tu.' He slipped his arm
round her, and murmured with an effort:</p>

<p>"Et vous etes ma belle femme."</p>

<p>Annette went off into a little fit of laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, non!" she said. "Oh, non! ne parlez pas Francais, Soames.
What is that old lady, your aunt, looking forward to?"</p>

<p>Soames bit his lip. "God knows!" he said; "she's always saying
something;" but he knew better than God.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI&mdash;SUSPENDED ANIMATION</h3>

<p>The war dragged on. Nicholas had been heard to say that it would
cost three hundred millions if it cost a penny before they'd done
with it! The income-tax was seriously threatened. Still, there
would be South Africa for their money, once for all. And though the
possessive instinct felt badly shaken at three o'clock in the
morning, it recovered by breakfast-time with the recollection that
one gets nothing in this world without paying for it. So, on the
whole, people went about their business much as if there were no
war, no concentration camps, no slippery de Wet, no feeling on the
Continent, no anything unpleasant. Indeed, the attitude of the
nation was typified by Timothy's map, whose animation was
suspended&mdash;for Timothy no longer moved the flags, and they
could not move themselves, not even backwards and forwards as they
should have done.</p>

<p>Suspended animation went further; it invaded Forsyte 'Change,
and produced a general uncertainty as to what was going to happen
next. The announcement in the marriage column of The Times, 'Jolyon
Forsyte to Irene, only daughter of the late Professor Heron,' had
occasioned doubt whether Irene had been justly described. And yet,
on the whole, relief was felt that she had not been entered as
'Irene, late the wife,' or 'the divorced wife,' 'of Soames
Forsyte.' Altogether, there had been a kind of sublimity from the
first about the way the family had taken that 'affair.' As James
had phrased it, 'There it was!' No use to fuss! Nothing to be had
out of admitting that it had been a 'nasty jar'&mdash;in the
phraseology of the day.</p>

<p>But what would happen now that both Soames and Jolyon were
married again? That was very intriguing. George was known to have
laid Eustace six to four on a little Jolyon before a little Soames.
George was so droll! It was rumoured, too, that he and Dartie had a
bet as to whether James would attain the age of ninety, though
which of them had backed James no one knew.</p>

<p>Early in May, Winifred came round to say that Val had been
wounded in the leg by a spent bullet, and was to be discharged. His
wife was nursing him. He would have a little limp&mdash;nothing to
speak of. He wanted his grandfather to buy him a farm out there
where he could breed horses. Her father was giving Holly eight
hundred a year, so they could be quite comfortable, because his
grandfather would give Val five, he had said; but as to the farm,
he didn't know&mdash;couldn't tell: he didn't want Val to go
throwing away his money.</p>

<p>"But you know," said Winifred, "he must do something."</p>

<p>Aunt Hester thought that perhaps his dear grandfather was wise,
because if he didn't buy a farm it couldn't turn out badly.</p>

<p>"But Val loves horses," said Winifred. "It'd be such an
occupation for him."</p>

<p>Aunt Juley thought that horses were very uncertain, had not
Montague found them so?</p>

<p>"Val's different," said Winifred; "he takes after me."</p>

<p>Aunt Juley was sure that dear Val was very clever. "I always
remember," she added, "how he gave his bad penny to a beggar. His
dear grandfather was so pleased. He thought it showed such presence
of mind. I remember his saying that he ought to go into the
Navy."</p>

<p>Aunt Hester chimed in: Did not Winifred think that it was much
better for the young people to be secure and not run any risk at
their age?</p>

<p>"Well," said Winifred, "if they were in London, perhaps; in
London it's amusing to do nothing. But out there, of course, he'll
simply get bored to death."</p>

<p>Aunt Hester thought that it would be nice for him to work, if he
were quite sure not to lose by it. It was not as if they had no
money. Timothy, of course, had done so well by retiring. Aunt Juley
wanted to know what Montague had said.</p>

<p>Winifred did not tell her, for Montague had merely remarked:
"Wait till the old man dies."</p>

<p>At this moment Francie was announced. Her eyes were brimming
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "what do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"Of what, dear?"</p>

<p>"In The Times this morning."</p>

<p>"We haven't seen it, we always read it after dinner; Timothy has
it till then."</p>

<p>Francie rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you think you ought to tell us?" said Aunt Juley. "What was
it?"</p>

<p>"Irene's had a son at Robin Hill."</p>

<p>Aunt Juley drew in her breath. "But," she said, "they were only
married in March!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Auntie; isn't it interesting?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Winifred, "I'm glad. I was sorry for Jolyon losing
his boy. It might have been Val."</p>

<p>Aunt Juley seemed to go into a sort of dream. "I wonder," she
murmured, "what dear Soames will think? He has so wanted to have a
son himself. A little bird has always told me that."</p>

<p>"Well," said Winifred, "he's going to&mdash;bar accidents."</p>

<p>Gladness trickled out of Aunt Juley's eyes.</p>

<p>"How delightful!" she said. "When?"</p>

<p>"November."</p>

<p>Such a lucky month! But she did wish it could be sooner. It was
a long time for James to wait, at his age!</p>

<p>To wait! They dreaded it for James, but they were used to it
themselves. Indeed, it was their great distraction. To wait! For
The Times to read; for one or other of their nieces or nephews to
come in and cheer them up; for news of Nicholas' health; for that
decision of Christopher's about going on the stage; for information
concerning the mine of Mrs. MacAnder's nephew; for the doctor to
come about Hester's inclination to wake up early in the morning;
for books from the library which were always out; for Timothy to
have a cold; for a nice quiet warm day, not too hot, when they
could take a turn in Kensington Gardens. To wait, one on each side
of the hearth in the drawing-room, for the clock between them to
strike; their thin, veined, knuckled hands plying knitting-needles
and crochet-hooks, their hair ordered to stop&mdash;like Canute's
waves&mdash;from any further advance in colour. To wait in their
black silks or satins for the Court to say that Hester might wear
her dark green, and Juley her darker maroon. To wait, slowly
turning over and over, in their old minds the little joys and
sorrows, events and expectancies, of their little family world, as
cows chew patient cuds in a familiar field. And this new event was
so well worth waiting for. Soames had always been their pet, with
his tendency to give them pictures, and his almost weekly visits
which they missed so much, and his need for their sympathy evoked
by the wreck of his first marriage. This new event&mdash;the birth
of an heir to Soames&mdash;was so important for him, and for his
dear father, too, that James might not have to die without some
certainty about things. James did so dislike uncertainty; and with
Montague, of course, he could not feel really satisfied to leave no
grand-children but the young Darties. After all, one's own name did
count! And as James' ninetieth birthday neared they wondered what
precautions he was taking. He would be the first of the Forsytes to
reach that age, and set, as it were, a new standard in holding on
to life. That was so important, they felt, at their ages
eighty-seven and eighty-five; though they did not want to think of
themselves when they had Timothy, who was not yet eighty-two, to
think of. There was, of course, a better world. 'In my Father's
house are many mansions' was one of Aunt Juley's favourite
sayings&mdash;it always comforted her, with its suggestion of house
property, which had made the fortune of dear Roger. The Bible was,
indeed, a great resource, and on very fine Sundays there was church
in the morning; and sometimes Juley would steal into Timothy's
study when she was sure he was out, and just put an open New
Testament casually among the books on his little table&mdash;he was
a great reader, of course, having been a publisher. But she had
noticed that Timothy was always cross at dinner afterwards. And
Smither had told her more than once that she had picked books off
the floor in doing the room. Still, with all that, they did feel
that heaven could not be quite so cosy as the rooms in which they
and Timothy had been waiting so long. Aunt Hester, especially,
could not bear the thought of the exertion. Any change, or rather
the thought of a change&mdash;for there never was any&mdash;always
upset her very much. Aunt Juley, who had more spirit, sometimes
thought it would be quite exciting; she had so enjoyed that visit
to Brighton the year dear Susan died. But then Brighton one knew
was nice, and it was so difficult to tell what heaven would be
like, so on the whole she was more than content to wait.</p>

<p>On the morning of James' birthday, August the 5th, they felt
extraordinary animation, and little notes passed between them by
the hand of Smither while they were having breakfast in their beds.
Smither must go round and take their love and little presents and
find out how Mr. James was, and whether he had passed a good night
with all the excitement. And on the way back would Smither call in
at Green Street&mdash;it was a little out of her way, but she could
take the bus up Bond Street afterwards; it would be a nice little
change for her&mdash;and ask dear Mrs. Dartie to be sure and look
in before she went out of town.</p>

<p>All this Smither did&mdash;an undeniable servant trained many
years ago under Aunt Ann to a perfection not now procurable. Mr.
James, so Mrs. James said, had passed an excellent night, he sent
his love; Mrs. James had said he was very funny and had complained
that he didn't know what all the fuss was about. Oh! and Mrs.
Dartie sent her love, and she would come to tea.</p>

<p>Aunts Juley and Hester, rather hurt that their presents had not
received special mention&mdash;they forgot every year that James
could not bear to receive presents, 'throwing away their money on
him,' as he always called it&mdash;were 'delighted'; it showed that
James was in good spirits, and that was so important for him. And
they began to wait for Winifred. She came at four, bringing Imogen,
and Maud, just back from school, and 'getting such a pretty girl,
too,' so that it was extremely difficult to ask for news about
Annette. Aunt Juley, however, summoned courage to enquire whether
Winifred had heard anything, and if Soames was anxious.</p>

<p>"Uncle Soames is always anxious, Auntie," interrupted Imogen;
"he can't be happy now he's got it."</p>

<p>The words struck familiarly on Aunt Juley's ears. Ah! yes; that
funny drawing of George's, which had not been shown them! But what
did Imogen mean? That her uncle always wanted more than he could
have? It was not at all nice to think like that.</p>

<p>Imogen's voice rose clear and clipped:</p>

<p>"Imagine! Annette's only two years older than me; it must be
awful for her, married to Uncle Soames."</p>

<p>Aunt Juley lifted her hands in horror.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said, "you don't know what you're talking about.
Your Uncle Soames is a match for anybody. He's a very clever man,
and good-looking and wealthy, and most considerate and careful, and
not at all old, considering everything."</p>

<p>Imogen, turning her luscious glance from one to the other of the
'old dears,' only smiled.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Aunt Juley quite severely, "that you will marry
as good a man."</p>

<p>"I shan't marry a good man, Auntie," murmured Imogen; "they're
dull."</p>

<p>"If you go on like this," replied Aunt Juley, still very much
upset, "you won't marry anybody. We'd better not pursue the
subject;" and turning to Winifred, she said: "How is Montague?"</p>

<p>That evening, while they were waiting for dinner, she
murmured:</p>

<p>"I've told Smither to get up half a bottle of the sweet
champagne, Hester. I think we ought to drink dear James' health,
and&mdash;and the health of Soames' wife; only, let's keep that
quite secret. I'll Just say like this, 'And you know, Hester!' and
then we'll drink. It might upset Timothy."</p>

<p>"It's more likely to upset us," said Aunt Nester. "But we must,
I suppose; for such an occasion."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Aunt Juley rapturously, "it is an occasion! Only
fancy if he has a dear little boy, to carry the family on! I do
feel it so important, now that Irene has had a son. Winifred says
George is calling Jolyon 'The Three-Decker,' because of his three
families, you know! George is droll. And fancy! Irene is living
after all in the house Soames had built for them both. It does seem
hard on dear Soames; and he's always been so regular."</p>

<p>That night in bed, excited and a little flushed still by her
glass of wine and the secrecy of the second toast, she lay with her
prayer-book opened flat, and her eyes fixed on a ceiling yellowed
by the light from her reading-lamp. Young things! It was so nice
for them all! And she would be so happy if she could see dear
Soames happy. But, of course, he must be now, in spite of what
Imogen had said. He would have all that he wanted: property, and
wife, and children! And he would live to a green old age, like his
dear father, and forget all about Irene and that dreadful case. If
only she herself could be here to buy his children their first
rocking-horse! Smither should choose it for her at the stores, nice
and dappled. Ah! how Roger used to rock her until she fell off! Oh
dear! that was a long time ago! It was! 'In my Father's house are
many mansions&mdash;'A little scrattling noise caught her
ear&mdash;'but no mice!' she thought mechanically. The noise
increased. There! it was a mouse! How naughty of Smither to say
there wasn't! It would be eating through the wainscot before they
knew where they were, and they would have to have the builders in.
They were such destructive things! And she lay, with her eyes just
moving, following in her mind that little scrattling sound, and
waiting for sleep to release her from it.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER XII&mdash;BIRTH OF A FORSYTE</h3>

<p>Soames walked out of the garden door, crossed the lawn, stood on
the path above the river, turned round and walked back to the
garden door, without having realised that he had moved. The sound
of wheels crunching the drive convinced him that time had passed,
and the doctor gone. What, exactly, had he said?</p>

<p>"This is the position, Mr. Forsyte. I can make pretty certain of
her life if I operate, but the baby will be born dead. If I don't
operate, the baby will most probably be born alive, but it's a
great risk for the mother&mdash;a great risk. In either case I
don't think she can ever have another child. In her state she
obviously can't decide for herself, and we can't wait for her
mother. It's for you to make the decision, while I'm getting what's
necessary. I shall be back within the hour."</p>

<p>The decision! What a decision! No time to get a specialist down!
No time for anything!</p>

<p>The sound of wheels died away, but Soames still stood intent;
then, suddenly covering his ears, he walked back to the river. To
come before its time like this, with no chance to foresee anything,
not even to get her mother here! It was for her mother to make that
decision, and she couldn't arrive from Paris till to-night! If only
he could have understood the doctor's jargon, the medical niceties,
so as to be sure he was weighing the chances properly; but they
were Greek to him&mdash;like a legal problem to a layman. And yet
he must decide! He brought his hand away from his brow wet, though
the air was chilly. These sounds which came from her room! To go
back there would only make it more difficult. He must be calm,
clear. On the one hand life, nearly certain, of his young wife,
death quite certain, of his child; and&mdash;no more children
afterwards! On the other, death perhaps of his wife, nearly certain
life for the child; and&mdash;no more children afterwards! Which to
choose?... It had rained this last fortnight&mdash;the river was
very full, and in the water, collected round the little house-boat
moored by his landing-stage, were many leaves from the woods above,
brought off by a frost. Leaves fell, lives drifted
down&mdash;Death! To decide about death! And no one to give him a
hand. Life lost was lost for good. Let nothing go that you could
keep; for, if it went, you couldn't get it back. It left you bare,
like those trees when they lost their leaves; barer and barer until
you, too, withered and came down. And, by a queer somersault of
thought, he seemed to see not Annette lying up there behind that
window-pane on which the sun was shining, but Irene lying in their
bedroom in Montpellier Square, as it might conceivably have been
her fate to lie, sixteen years ago. Would he have hesitated then?
Not a moment! Operate, operate! Make certain of her life! No
decision&mdash;a mere instinctive cry for help, in spite of his
knowledge, even then, that she did not love him! But this! Ah!
there was nothing overmastering in his feeling for Annette! Many
times these last months, especially since she had been growing
frightened, he had wondered. She had a will of her own, was selfish
in her French way. And yet&mdash;so pretty! What would she
wish&mdash;to take the risk. 'I know she wants the child,' he
thought. 'If it's born dead, and no more chance
afterwards&mdash;it'll upset her terribly. No more chance! All for
nothing! Married life with her for years and years without a child.
Nothing to steady her! She's too young. Nothing to look forward to,
for her&mdash;for me! For me!' He struck his hands against his
chest! Why couldn't he think without bringing himself in&mdash;get
out of himself and see what he ought to do? The thought hurt him,
then lost edge, as if it had come in contact with a breastplate.
Out of oneself! Impossible! Out into soundless, scentless,
touchless, sightless space! The very idea was ghastly, futile! And
touching there the bedrock of reality, the bottom of his Forsyte
spirit, Soames rested for a moment. When one ceased, all ceased; it
might go on, but there'd be nothing in it!</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. In half an hour the doctor would be
back. He must decide! If against the operation and she died, how
face her mother and the doctor afterwards? How face his own
conscience? It was his child that she was having. If for the
operation&mdash;then he condemned them both to childlessness. And
for what else had he married her but to have a lawful heir? And his
father&mdash;at death's door, waiting for the news! 'It's cruel!'
he thought; 'I ought never to have such a thing to settle! It's
cruel!' He turned towards the house. Some deep, simple way of
deciding! He took out a coin, and put it back. If he spun it, he
knew he would not abide by what came up! He went into the
dining-room, furthest away from that room whence the sounds issued.
The doctor had said there was a chance. In here that chance seemed
greater; the river did not flow, nor the leaves fall. A fire was
burning. Soames unlocked the tantalus. He hardly ever touched
spirits, but now&mdash;he poured himself out some whisky and drank
it neat, craving a faster flow of blood. 'That fellow Jolyon,' he
thought; 'he had children already. He has the woman I really loved;
and now a son by her! And I&mdash;I'm asked to destroy my only
child! Annette can't die; it's not possible. She's strong!'</p>

<p>He was still standing sullenly at the sideboard when he heard
the doctor's carriage, and went out to him. He had to wait for him
to come downstairs.</p>

<p>"Well, doctor?"</p>

<p>"The situation's the same. Have you decided?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Soames; "don't operate!"</p>

<p>"Not? You understand&mdash;the risk's great?"</p>

<p>In Soames' set face nothing moved but the lips.</p>

<p>"You said there was a chance?"</p>

<p>"A chance, yes; not much of one."</p>

<p>"You say the baby must be born dead if you do?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you still think that in any case she can't have
another?"</p>

<p>"One can't be absolutely sure, but it's most unlikely."</p>

<p>"She's strong," said Soames; "we'll take the risk."</p>

<p>The doctor looked at him very gravely. "It's on your shoulders,"
he said; "with my own wife, I couldn't."</p>

<p>Soames' chin jerked up as if someone had hit him.</p>

<p>"Am I of any use up there?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No; keep away."</p>

<p>"I shall be in my picture-gallery, then; you know where."</p>

<p>The doctor nodded, and went upstairs.</p>

<p>Soames continued to stand, listening. 'By this time to-morrow,'
he thought, 'I may have her death on my hands.' No! it was
unfair&mdash;monstrous, to put it that way! Sullenness dropped on
him again, and he went up to the gallery. He stood at the window.
The wind was in the north; it was cold, clear; very blue sky, heavy
ragged white clouds chasing across; the river blue, too, through
the screen of goldening trees; the woods all rich with colour,
glowing, burnished-an early autumn. If it were his own life, would
he be taking that risk? 'But she'd take the risk of losing me,' he
thought, 'sooner than lose her child! She doesn't really love me!'
What could one expect&mdash;a girl and French? The one thing really
vital to them both, vital to their marriage and their futures, was
a child! 'I've been through a lot for this,' he thought, 'I'll hold
on&mdash;hold on. There's a chance of keeping both&mdash;a chance!'
One kept till things were taken&mdash;one naturally kept! He began
walking round the gallery. He had made one purchase lately which he
knew was a fortune in itself, and he halted before it&mdash;a girl
with dull gold hair which looked like filaments of metal gazing at
a little golden monster she was holding in her hand. Even at this
tortured moment he could just feel the extraordinary nature of the
bargain he had made&mdash;admire the quality of the table, the
floor, the chair, the girl's figure, the absorbed expression on her
face, the dull gold filaments of her hair, the bright gold of the
little monster. Collecting pictures; growing richer, richer! What
use, if...! He turned his back abruptly on the picture, and went to
the window. Some of his doves had flown up from their perches round
the dovecot, and were stretching their wings in the wind. In the
clear sharp sunlight their whiteness almost flashed. They flew far,
making a flung-up hieroglyphic against the sky. Annette fed the
doves; it was pretty to see her. They took it out of her hand; they
knew she was matter-of-fact. A choking sensation came into his
throat. She would not&mdash;could nod die! She was too&mdash;too
sensible; and she was strong, really strong, like her mother, in
spite of her fair prettiness.</p>

<p>It was already growing dark when at last he opened the door, and
stood listening. Not a sound! A milky twilight crept about the
stairway and the landings below. He had turned back when a sound
caught his ear. Peering down, he saw a black shape moving, and his
heart stood still. What was it? Death? The shape of Death coming
from her door? No! only a maid without cap or apron. She came to
the foot of his flight of stairs and said breathlessly:</p>

<p>"The doctor wants to see you, sir."</p>

<p>He ran down. She stood flat against the wall to let him pass,
and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, Sir! it's over."</p>

<p>"Over?" said Soames, with a sort of menace; "what d'you
mean?"</p>

<p>"It's born, sir."</p>

<p>He dashed up the four steps in front of him, and came suddenly
on the doctor in the dim passage. The man was wiping his brow.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said; "quick!"</p>

<p>"Both living; it's all right, I think."</p>

<p>Soames stood quite still, covering his eyes.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you," he heard the doctor say; "it was touch and
go."</p>

<p>Soames let fall the hand which was covering his face.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said; "thanks very much. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Daughter&mdash;luckily; a son would have killed her&mdash;the
head."</p>

<p>A daughter!</p>

<p>"The utmost care of both," he hearts the doctor say, "and we
shall do. When does the mother come?"</p>

<p>"To-night, between nine and ten, I hope."</p>

<p>"I'll stay till then. Do you want to see them?"</p>

<p>"Not now," said Soames; "before you go. I'll have dinner sent up
to you." And he went downstairs.</p>

<p>Relief unspeakable, and yet&mdash;a daughter! It seemed to him
unfair. To have taken that risk&mdash;to have been through this
agony&mdash;and what agony!&mdash;for a daughter! He stood before
the blazing fire of wood logs in the hall, touching it with his toe
and trying to readjust himself. 'My father!' he thought. A bitter
disappointment, no disguising it! One never got all one wanted in
this life! And there was no other&mdash;at least, if there was, it
was no use!</p>

<p>While he was standing there, a telegram was brought him.</p>

<p>"Come up at once, your father sinking fast.&mdash;MOTHER."</p>

<p>He read it with a choking sensation. One would have thought he
couldn't feel anything after these last hours, but he felt this.
Half-past seven, a train from Reading at nine, and madame's train,
if she had caught it, came in at eight-forty&mdash;he would meet
that, and go on. He ordered the carriage, ate some dinner
mechanically, and went upstairs. The doctor came out to him.</p>

<p>"They're sleeping."</p>

<p>"I won't go in," said Soames with relief. "My father's dying; I
have to&mdash;go up. Is it all right?"</p>

<p>The doctor's face expressed a kind of doubting admiration. 'If
they were all as unemotional' he might have been saying.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you may go with an easy mind. You'll be down
soon?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said Soames. "Here's the address."</p>

<p>The doctor seemed to hover on the verge of sympathy.</p>

<p>"Good-night!" said Soames abruptly, and turned away. He put on
his fur coat. Death! It was a chilly business. He smoked a
cigarette in the carriage&mdash;one of his rare cigarettes. The
night was windy and flew on black wings; the carriage lights had to
search out the way. His father! That old, old man! A comfortless
night&mdash;to die!</p>

<p>The London train came in just as he reached the station, and
Madame Lamotte, substantial, dark-clothed, very yellow in the
lamplight, came towards the exit with a dressing-bag.</p>

<p>"This all you have?" asked Soames.</p>

<p>"But yes; I had not the time. How is my little one?"</p>

<p>"Doing well&mdash;both. A girl!"</p>

<p>"A girl! What joy! I had a frightful crossing!"</p>

<p>Her black bulk, solid, unreduced by the frightful crossing,
climbed into the brougham.</p>

<p>"And you, mon cher?"</p>

<p>"My father's dying," said Soames between his teeth. "I'm going
up. Give my love to Annette."</p>

<p>"Tiens!" murmured Madame Lamotte; "quel malheur!"</p>

<p>Soames took his hat off, and moved towards his train. 'The
French!' he thought.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;JAMES IS TOLD</h3>

<p>A simple cold, caught in the room with double windows, where the
air and the people who saw him were filtered, as it were, the room
he had not left since the middle of September&mdash;and James was
in deep waters. A little cold, passing his little strength and
flying quickly to his lungs. "He mustn't catch cold," the doctor
had declared, and he had gone and caught it. When he first felt it
in his throat he had said to his nurse&mdash;for he had one
now&mdash;"There, I knew how it would be, airing the room like
that!" For a whole day he was highly nervous about himself and went
in advance of all precautions and remedies; drawing every breath
with extreme care and having his temperature taken every hour.
Emily was not alarmed.</p>

<p>But next morning when she went in the nurse whispered: "He won't
have his temperature taken."</p>

<p>Emily crossed to the side of the bed where he was lying, and
said softly, "How do you feel, James?" holding the thermometer to
his lips. James looked up at her.</p>

<p>"What's the good of that?" he murmured huskily; "I don't want to
know."</p>

<p>Then she was alarmed. He breathed with difficulty, he looked
terribly frail, white, with faint red discolorations. She had 'had
trouble' with him, Goodness knew; but he was James, had been James
for nearly fifty years; she couldn't remember or imagine life
without James&mdash;James, behind all his fussiness, his pessimism,
his crusty shell, deeply affectionate, really kind and generous to
them all!</p>

<p>All that day and the next he hardly uttered a word, but there
was in his eyes a noticing of everything done for him, a look on
his face which told her he was fighting; and she did not lose hope.
His very stillness, the way he conserved every little scrap of
energy, showed the tenacity with which he was fighting. It touched
her deeply; and though her face was composed and comfortable in the
sick-room, tears ran down her cheeks when she was out of it.</p>

<p>About tea-time on the third day&mdash;she had just changed her
dress, keeping her appearance so as not to alarm him, because he
noticed everything&mdash;she saw a difference. 'It's no use; I'm
tired,' was written plainly across that white face, and when she
went up to him, he muttered: "Send for Soames."</p>

<p>"Yes, James," she said comfortably; "all right&mdash;at once."
And she kissed his forehead. A tear dropped there, and as she wiped
it off she saw that his eyes looked grateful. Much upset, and
without hope now, she sent Soames the telegram.</p>

<p>When he entered out of the black windy night, the big house was
still as a grave. Warmson's broad face looked almost narrow; he
took the fur coat with a sort of added care, saying:</p>

<p>"Will you have a glass of wine, sir?"</p>

<p>Soames shook his head, and his eyebrows made enquiry.</p>

<p>Warmson's lips twitched. "He's asking for you, sir;" and
suddenly he blew his nose. "It's a long time, sir," he said, "that
I've been with Mr. Forsyte&mdash;a long time."</p>

<p>Soames left him folding the coat, and began to mount the stairs.
This house, where he had been born and sheltered, had never seemed
to him so warm, and rich, and cosy, as during this last pilgrimage
to his father's room. It was not his taste; but in its own
substantial, lincrusta way it was the acme of comfort and security.
And the night was so dark and windy; the grave so cold and
lonely!</p>

<p>He paused outside the door. No sound came from within. He turned
the handle softly and was in the room before he was perceived. The
light was shaded. His mother and Winifred were sitting on the far
side of the bed; the nurse was moving away from the near side where
was an empty chair. 'For me!' thought Soames. As he moved from the
door his mother and sister rose, but he signed with his hand and
they sat down again. He went up to the chair and stood looking at
his father. James' breathing was as if strangled; his eyes were
closed. And in Soames, looking on his father so worn and white and
wasted, listening to his strangled breathing, there rose a
passionate vehemence of anger against Nature, cruel, inexorable
Nature, kneeling on the chest of that wisp of a body, slowly
pressing out the breath, pressing out the life of the being who was
dearest to him in the world. His father, of all men, had lived a
careful life, moderate, abstemious, and this was his
reward&mdash;to have life slowly, painfully squeezed out of him!
And, without knowing that he spoke, he said: "It's cruel!"</p>

<p>He saw his mother cover her eyes and Winifred bow her face
towards the bed. Women! They put up with things so much better than
men. He took a step nearer to his father. For three days James had
not been shaved, and his lips and chin were covered with hair,
hardly more snowy than his forehead. It softened his face, gave it
a queer look already not of this world. His eyes opened. Soames
went quite close and bent over. The lips moved.</p>

<p>"Here I am, Father:"</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;what&mdash;what news? They never tell..." the voice
died, and a flood of emotion made Soames' face work so that he
could not speak. Tell him?&mdash;yes. But what? He made a great
effort, got his lips together, and said:</p>

<p>"Good news, dear, good&mdash;Annette, a son."</p>

<p>"Ah!" It was the queerest sound, ugly, relieved, pitiful,
triumphant&mdash;like the noise a baby makes getting what it wants.
The eyes closed, and that strangled sound of breathing began again.
Soames recoiled to the chair and stonily sat down. The lie he had
told, based, as it were, on some deep, temperamental instinct that
after death James would not know the truth, had taken away all
power of feeling for the moment. His arm brushed against something.
It was his father's naked foot. In the struggle to breathe he had
pushed it out from under the clothes. Soames took it in his hand, a
cold foot, light and thin, white, very cold. What use to put it
back, to wrap up that which must be colder soon! He warmed it
mechanically with his hand, listening to his father's laboured
breathing; while the power of feeling rose again within him. A
little sob, quickly smothered, came from Winifred, but his mother
sat unmoving with her eyes fixed on James. Soames signed to the
nurse.</p>

<p>"Where's the doctor?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"He's been sent for."</p>

<p>"Can't you do anything to ease his breathing?"</p>

<p>"Only an injection; and he can't stand it. The doctor said,
while he was fighting..."</p>

<p>"He's not fighting," whispered Soames, "he's being slowly
smothered. It's awful."</p>

<p>James stirred uneasily, as if he knew what they were saying.
Soames rose and bent over him. James feebly moved his two hands,
and Soames took them.</p>

<p>"He wants to be pulled up," whispered the nurse.</p>

<p>Soames pulled. He thought he pulled gently, but a look almost of
anger passed over James' face. The nurse plumped the pillows.
Soames laid the hands down, and bending over kissed his father's
forehead. As he was raising himself again, James' eyes bent on him
a look which seemed to come from the very depths of what was left
within. 'I'm done, my boy,' it seemed to say, 'take care of them,
take care of yourself; take care&mdash;I leave it all to you.'</p>

<p>"Yes, Yes," Soames whispered, "yes, yes."</p>

<p>Behind him the nurse did he knew, not what, for his father made
a tiny movement of repulsion as if resenting that interference; and
almost at once his breathing eased away, became quiet; he lay very
still. The strained expression on his face passed, a curious white
tranquillity took its place. His eyelids quivered, rested; the
whole face rested; at ease. Only by the faint puffing of his lips
could they tell that he was breathing. Soames sank back on his
chair, and fell to cherishing the foot again. He heard the nurse
quietly crying over there by the fire; curious that she, a
stranger, should be the only one of them who cried! He heard the
quiet lick and flutter of the fire flames. One more old Forsyte
going to his long rest&mdash;wonderful, they were!&mdash;wonderful
how he had held on! His mother and Winifred were leaning forward,
hanging on the sight of James' lips. But Soames bent sideways over
the feet, warming them both; they gave him comfort, colder and
colder though they grew. Suddenly he started up; a sound, a
dreadful sound such as he had never heard, was coming from his
father's lips, as if an outraged heart had broken with a long moan.
What a strong heart, to have uttered that farewell! It ceased.
Soames looked into the face. No motion; no breath! Dead! He kissed
the brow, turned round and went out of the room. He ran upstairs to
the bedroom, his old bedroom, still kept for him; flung himself
face down on the bed, and broke into sobs which he stilled with the
pillow...</p>

<p>A little later he went downstairs and passed into the room.
James lay alone, wonderfully calm, free from shadow and anxiety,
with the gravity on his ravaged face which underlies great age, the
worn fine gravity of old coins.</p>

<p>Soames looked steadily at that face, at the fire, at all the
room with windows thrown open to the London night.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" he whispered, and went out.</p>

<hr>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;HIS</h3>

<p>He had much to see to, that night and all next day. A telegram
at breakfast reassured him about Annette, and he only caught the
last train back to Reading, with Emily's kiss on his forehead and
in his ears her words:</p>

<p>"I don't know what I should have done without you, my dear
boy."</p>

<p>He reached his house at midnight. The weather had changed, was
mild again, as though, having finished its work and sent a Forsyte
to his last account, it could relax. A second telegram, received at
dinner-time, had confirmed the good news of Annette, and, instead
of going in, Soames passed down through the garden in the moonlight
to his houseboat. He could sleep there quite well. Bitterly tired,
he lay down on the sofa in his fur coat and fell asleep. He woke
soon after dawn and went on deck. He stood against the rail,
looking west where the river swept round in a wide curve under the
woods. In Soames, appreciation of natural beauty was curiously like
that of his farmer ancestors, a sense of grievance if it wasn't
there, sharpened, no doubt, and civilised, by his researches among
landscape painting. But dawn has power to fertilise the most
matter-of-fact vision, and he was stirred. It was another world
from the river he knew, under that remote cool light; a world into
which man had not entered, an unreal world, like some strange shore
sighted by discovery. Its colour was not the colour of convention,
was hardly colour at all; its shapes were brooding yet distinct;
its silence stunning; it had no scent. Why it should move him he
could not tell, unless it were that he felt so alone in it, bare of
all relationship and all possessions. Into such a world his father
might be voyaging, for all resemblance it had to the world he had
left. And Soames took refuge from it in wondering what painter
could have done it justice. The white-grey water was
like&mdash;like the belly of a fish! Was it possible that this
world on which he looked was all private property, except the
water&mdash;and even that was tapped! No tree, no shrub, not a
blade of grass, not a bird or beast, not even a fish that was not
owned. And once on a time all this was jungle and marsh and water,
and weird creatures roamed and sported without human cognizance to
give them names; rotting luxuriance had rioted where those tall,
carefully planted woods came down to the water, and marsh-misted
reeds on that far side had covered all the pasture. Well! they had
got it under, kennelled it all up, labelled it, and stowed it in
lawyers' offices. And a good thing too! But once in a way, as now,
the ghost of the past came out to haunt and brood and whisper to
any human who chanced to be awake: 'Out of my unowned loneliness
you all came, into it some day you will all return.'</p>

<p>And Soames, who felt the chill and the eeriness of that
world-new to him and so very old: the world, unowned, visiting the
scene of its past&mdash;went down and made himself tea on a
spirit-lamp. When he had drunk it, he took out writing materials
and wrote two paragraphs:</p>

<p>"On the 20th instant at his residence in Park Lane, James
Forsyte, in his ninety-first year. Funeral at noon on the 24th at
Highgate. No flowers by request."</p>

<p>"On the 20th instant at The Shelter; Mapledurham, Annette, wife
of Soames Forsyte, of a daughter." And underneath on the
blottingpaper he traced the word "son."</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock in an ordinary autumn world when he went
across to the house. Bushes across the river stood round and
bright-coloured out of a milky haze; the wood-smoke went up blue
and straight; and his doves cooed, preening their feathers in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>He stole up to his dressing-room, bathed, shaved, put on fresh
linen and dark clothes.</p>

<p>Madame Lamotte was beginning her breakfast when he went
down.</p>

<p>She looked at his clothes, said, "Don't tell me!" and pressed
his hand. "Annette is prettee well. But the doctor say she can
never have no more children. You knew that?" Soames nodded. "It's a
pity. Mais la petite est adorable. Du cafe?"</p>

<p>Soames got away from her as soon as he could. She offended
him&mdash;solid, matter-of-fact, quick, clear&mdash;French. He
could not bear her vowels, her 'r's'; he resented the way she had
looked at him, as if it were his fault that Annette could never
bear him a son! His fault! He even resented her cheap adoration of
the daughter he had not yet seen.</p>

<p>Curious how he jibbed away from sight of his wife and child!</p>

<p>One would have thought he must have rushed up at the first
moment. On the contrary, he had a sort of physical shrinking from
it&mdash;fastidious possessor that he was. He was afraid of what
Annette was thinking of him, author of her agonies, afraid of the
look of the baby, afraid of showing his disappointment with the
present and&mdash;the future.</p>

<p>He spent an hour walking up and down the drawing-room before he
could screw his courage up to mount the stairs and knock on the
door of their room.</p>

<p>Madame Lamotte opened it.</p>

<p>"Ah! At last you come! Elle vous attend!" She passed him, and
Soames went in with his noiseless step, his jaw firmly set, his
eyes furtive.</p>

<p>Annette was very pale and very pretty lying there. The baby was
hidden away somewhere; he could not see it. He went up to the bed,
and with sudden emotion bent and kissed her forehead.</p>

<p>"Here you are then, Soames," she said. "I am not so bad now. But
I suffered terribly, terribly. I am glad I cannot have any more.
Oh! how I suffered!"</p>

<p>Soames stood silent, stroking her hand; words of endearment, of
sympathy, absolutely would not come; the thought passed through
him: 'An English girl wouldn't have said that!' At this moment he
knew with certainty that he would never be near to her in spirit
and in truth, nor she to him. He had collected her&mdash;that was
all! And Jolyon's words came rushing into his mind: "I should
imagine you will be glad to have your neck out of chancery." Well,
he had got it out! Had he got it in again?</p>

<p>"We must feed you up," he said, "you'll soon be strong."</p>

<p>"Don't you want to see baby, Soames? She is asleep."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Soames, "very much."</p>

<p>He passed round the foot of the bed to the other side and stood
staring. For the first moment what he saw was much what he had
expected to see&mdash;a baby. But as he stared and the baby
breathed and made little sleeping movements with its tiny features,
it seemed to assume an individual shape, grew to be like a picture,
a thing he would know again; not repulsive, strangely bud-like and
touching. It had dark hair. He touched it with his finger, he
wanted to see its eyes. They opened, they were dark&mdash;whether
blue or brown he could not tell. The eyes winked, stared, they had
a sort of sleepy depth in them. And suddenly his heart felt queer,
warm, as if elated.</p>

<p>"Ma petite fleur!" Annette said softly.</p>

<p>"Fleur," repeated Soames: "Fleur! we'll call her that."</p>

<p>The sense of triumph and renewed possession swelled within
him.</p>

<p>By God! this&mdash;this thing was his! By God! this&mdash;this
thing was his!</p>

<p class="cp"><b>TO CHARLES SCRIBNER</b>
</p>

<p>Through the massive skylight illuminating the hall at Robin
Hill, the July sunlight at five o'clock fell just where the broad
stairway turned; and in that radiant streak little Jon Forsyte
stood, blue-linen-suited. His hair was shining, and his eyes, from
beneath a frown, for he was considering how to go downstairs, this
last of innumerable times, before the car brought his father and
mother home. Four at a time, and five at the bottom? Stale! Down
the banisters? But in which fashion? On his face, feet foremost?
Very stale. On his stomach, sideways? Paltry! On his back, with his
arms stretched down on both sides? Forbidden! Or on his face, head
foremost, in a manner unknown as yet to any but himself? Such was
the cause of the frown on the illuminated face of little Jon...</p>

<p>In that Summer of 1909 the simple souls who even then desired to
simplify the English tongue, had, of course, no cognizance of
little Jon, or they would have claimed him for a disciple. But one
can be too simple in this life, for his real name was Jolyon, and
his living father and dead half-brother had usurped of old the
other shortenings, Jo and Jolly. As a fact little Jon had done his
best to conform to convention and spell himself first Jhon, then
John; not till his father had explained the sheer necessity, had he
spelled his name Jon.</p>

<p>Up till now that father had possessed what was left of his heart
by the groom, Bob, who played the concertina, and his nurse "Da,"
who wore the violet dress on Sundays, and enjoyed the name of
Spraggins in that private life lived at odd moments even by
domestic servants. His mother had only appeared to him, as it were
in dreams, smelling delicious, smoothing his forehead just before
he fell asleep, and sometimes docking his hair, of a golden brown
colour. When he cut his head open against the nursery fender she
was there to be bled over; and when he had nightmare she would sit
on his bed and cuddle his head against her neck. She was precious
but remote, because "Da" was so near, and there is hardly room for
more than one woman at a time in a man's heart. With his father,
too, of course, he had special bonds of union; for little Jon also
meant to be a painter when he grew up&mdash;with the one small
difference, that his father painted pictures, and little Jon
intended to paint ceilings and walls, standing on a board between
two step-ladders, in a dirty-white apron, and a lovely smell of
whitewash. His father also took him riding in Richmond Park, on his
pony, Mouse, so-called because it was so-coloured.</p>

<p>Little Jon had been born with a silver spoon in a mouth which
was rather curly and large. He had never heard his father or his
mother speak in an angry voice, either to each other, himself, or
anybody else; the groom, Bob, Cook, Jane, Bella and the other
servants, even "Da," who alone restrained him in his courses, had
special voices when they talked to him. He was therefore of opinion
that the world was a place of perfect and perpetual gentility and
freedom.</p>

<p>A child of 1901, he had come to consciousness when his country,
just over that bad attack of scarlet fever, the Boer War, was
preparing for the Liberal revival of 1906. Coercion was unpopular,
parents had exalted notions of giving their offspring a good time.
They spoiled their rods, spared their children, and anticipated the
results with enthusiasm. In choosing, moreover, for his father an
amiable man of fifty-two, who had already lost an only son, and for
his mother a woman of thirty-eight, whose first and only child he
was, little Jon had done well and wisely. What had saved him from
becoming a cross between a lap dog and a little prig, had been his
father's adoration of his mother, for even little Jon could see
that she was not merely just his mother, and that he played second
fiddle to her in his father's heart: What he played in his mother's
heart he knew not yet. As for "Auntie" June, his half-sister (but
so old that she had grown out of the relationship) she loved him,
of course, but was too sudden. His devoted "Da," too, had a Spartan
touch. His bath was cold and his knees were bare; he was not
encouraged to be sorry for himself. As to the vexed question of his
education, little Jon shared the theory of those who considered
that children should not be forced. He rather liked the
Mademoiselle who came for two hours every morning to teach him her
language, together with history, geography and sums; nor were the
piano lessons which his mother gave him disagreeable, for she had a
way of luring him from tune to tune, never making him practise one
which did not give him pleasure, so that he remained eager to
convert ten thumbs into eight fingers. Under his father he learned
to draw pleasure-pigs and other animals. He was not a highly
educated little boy. Yet, on the whole, the silver spoon stayed in
his mouth without spoiling it, though "Da" sometimes said that
other children would do him a "world of good."</p>

<p>It was a disillusionment, then, when at the age of nearly seven
she held him down on his back, because he wanted to do something of
which she did not approve. This first interference with the free
individualism of a Forsyte drove him almost frantic. There was
something appalling in the utter helplessness of that position, and
the uncertainty as to whether it would ever come to an end. Suppose
she never let him get up any more! He suffered torture at the top
of his voice for fifty seconds. Worse than anything was his
perception that "Da" had taken all that time to realise the agony
of fear he was enduring. Thus, dreadfully, was revealed to him the
lack of imagination in the human being.</p>

<p>When he was let up he remained convinced that "Da" had done a
dreadful thing. Though he did not wish to bear witness against her,
he had been compelled, by fear of repetition, to seek his mother
and say: "Mum, don't let 'Da' hold me down on my back again."</p>

<p>His mother, her hands held up over her head, and in them two
plaits of hair&mdash;"couleur de feuille morte," as little Jon had
not yet learned to call it&mdash;had looked at him with eyes like
little bits of his brown velvet tunic, and answered:</p>

<p>"No, darling, I won't."</p>

<p>She, being in the nature of a goddess, little Jon was satisfied;
especially when, from under the dining-table at breakfast, where he
happened to be waiting for a mushroom, he had overheard her say to
his father:</p>

<p>"Then, will you tell 'Da,' dear, or shall I? She's so devoted to
him"; and his father's answer:</p>

<p>"Well, she mustn't show it that way. I know exactly what it
feels like to be held down on one's back. No Forsyte can stand it
for a minute."</p>

<p>Conscious that they did not know him to be under the table,
little Jon was visited by the quite new feeling of embarrassment,
and stayed where he was, ravaged by desire for the mushroom.</p>

<p>Such had been his first dip into the dark abysses of existence.
Nothing much had been revealed to him after that, till one day,
having gone down to the cow-house for his drink of milk fresh from
the cow, after Garratt had finished milking, he had seen Clover's
calf, dead. Inconsolable, and followed by an upset Garratt, he had
sought "Da"; but suddenly aware that she was not the person he
wanted, had rushed away to find his father, and had run into the
arms of his mother.</p>

<p>"Clover's calf's dead! Oh! Oh! It looked so soft!"</p>

<p>His mother's clasp, and her:</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, there, there!" had stayed his sobbing. But if
Clover's calf could die, anything could&mdash;not only bees, flies,
beetles and chickens&mdash;and look soft like that! This was
appalling&mdash;and soon forgotten!</p>

<p>The next thing had been to sit on a bumble bee, a poignant
experience, which his mother had understood much better than "Da";
and nothing of vital importance had happened after that till the
year turned; when, following a day of utter wretchedness, he had
enjoyed a disease composed of little spots, bed, honey in a spoon,
and many Tangerine oranges. It was then that the world had
flowered. To "Auntie" June he owed that flowering, for no sooner
was he a little lame duck than she came rushing down from London,
bringing with her the books which had nurtured her own Berserker
spirit, born in the noted year of 1869. Aged, and of many colours,
they were stored with the most formidable happenings. Of these she
read to little Jon, till he was allowed to read to himself;
whereupon she whisked back to London and left them with him in a
heap. Those books cooked his fancy, till he thought and dreamed of
nothing but midshipmen and dhows, pirates, rafts, sandal-wood
traders, iron horses, sharks, battles, Tartars, Red Indians,
balloons, North Poles and other extravagant delights. The moment he
was suffered to get up, he rigged his bed fore and aft, and set out
from it in a narrow bath across green seas of carpet, to a rock,
which he climbed by means of its mahogany drawer knobs, to sweep
the horizon with his drinking tumbler screwed to his eye, in search
of rescuing sails. He made a daily raft out of the towel stand, the
tea tray, and his pillows. He saved the juice from his French
plums, bottled it in an empty medicine bottle, and provisioned the
raft with the rum that it became; also with pemmican made out of
little saved-up bits of chicken sat on and dried at the fire; and
with lime juice against scurvy, extracted from the peel of his
oranges and a little economised juice. He made a North Pole one
morning from the whole of his bedclothes except the bolster, and
reached it in a birch-bark canoe (in private life the fender),
after a terrible encounter with a polar bear fashioned from the
bolster and four skittles dressed up in "Da's" nightgown. After
that, his father, seeking to steady his imagination, brought him
Ivanboe, Bevis, a book about King Arthur, and Tom Brown's
Schooldays. He read the first, and for three days built, defended
and stormed Front de Boeuf's castle, taking every part in the piece
except those of Rebecca and Rowena; with piercing cries of: "En
avant, de Bracy!" and similar utterances. After reading the book
about King Arthur he became almost exclusively Sir Lamorac de
Galis, because, though there was very little about him, he
preferred his name to that of any other knight; and he rode his old
rocking-horse to death, armed with a long bamboo. Bevis he found
tame; besides, it required woods and animals, of which he had none
in his nursery, except his two cats, Fitz and Puck Forsyte, who
permitted no liberties. For Tom Brown he was as yet too young.
There was relief in the house when, after the fourth week, he was
permitted to go down and out.</p>

<p>The month being March the trees were exceptionally like the
masts of ships, and for little Jon that was a wonderful Spring,
extremely hard on his knees, suits, and the patience of "Da," who
had the washing and reparation of his clothes. Every morning the
moment his breakfast was over, he could be viewed by his mother and
father, whose windows looked out that way, coming from the study,
crossing the terrace, climbing the old oak tree, his face resolute
and his hair bright. He began the day thus because there was not
time to go far afield before his lessons. The old tree's variety
never staled; it had mainmast, foremast, top-gallant mast, and he
could always come down by the halyards&mdash;or ropes of the swing.
After his lessons, completed by eleven, he would go to the kitchen
for a thin piece of cheese, a biscuit and two French
plums&mdash;provision enough for a jolly-boat at least&mdash;and
eat it in some imaginative way; then, armed to the teeth with gun,
pistols, and sword, he would begin the serious climbing of the
morning, encountering by the way innumerable slavers, Indians,
pirates, leopards, and bears. He was seldom seen at that hour of
the day without a cutlass in his teeth (like Dick Needham) amid the
rapid explosion of copper caps. And many were the gardeners he
brought down with yellow peas shot out of his little gun. He lived
a life of the most violent action.</p>

<p>"Jon," said his father to his mother, under the oak tree, "is
terrible. I'm afraid he's going to turn out a sailor, or something
hopeless. Do you see any sign of his appreciating beauty?"</p>

<p>"Not the faintest."</p>

<p>"Well, thank heaven he's no turn for wheels or engines! I can
bear anything but that. But I wish he'd take more interest in
Nature."</p>

<p>"He's imaginative, Jolyon."</p>

<p>"Yes, in a sanguinary way. Does he love anyone just now?"</p>

<p>"No; only everyone. There never was anyone born more loving or
more lovable than Jon."</p>

<p>"Being your boy, Irene."</p>

<p>At this moment little Jon, lying along a branch high above them,
brought them down with two peas; but that fragment of talk lodged,
thick, in his small gizzard. Loving, lovable, imaginative,
sanguinary!</p>

<p>The leaves also were thick by now, and it was time for his
birthday, which, occurring every year on the twelfth of May, was
always memorable for his chosen dinner of sweetbread, mushrooms,
macaroons, and ginger beer.</p>

<p>Between that eighth birthday, however, and the afternoon when he
stood in the July radiance at the turning of the stairway, several
important things had happened.</p>

<p>"Da," worn out by washing his knees, or moved by that mysterious
instinct which forces even nurses to desert their nurslings, left
the very day after his birthday in floods of tears "to be
married"&mdash;of all things&mdash;"to a man." Little Jon, from
whom it had been kept, was inconsolable for an afternoon. It ought
not to have been kept from him! Two large boxes of soldiers and
some artillery, together with The Young Buglers, which had been
among his birthday presents, cooperated with his grief in a sort of
conversion, and instead of seeking adventures in person and risking
his own life, he began to play imaginative games, in which he
risked the lives of countless tin soldiers, marbles, stones and
beans. Of these forms of "chair a canon" he made collections, and,
using them alternately, fought the Peninsular, the Seven Years, the
Thirty Years, and other wars, about which he had been reading of
late in a big History of Europe which had been his grandfather's.
He altered them to suit his genius, and fought them all over the
floor in his day nursery, so that nobody could come in, for fearing
of disturbing Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, or treading on an
army of Austrians. Because of the sound of the word he was
passionately addicted to the Austrians, and finding there were so
few battles in which they were successful he had to invent them in
his games. His favourite generals were Prince Eugene, the Archduke
Charles and Wallenstein. Tilly and Mack ("music-hall turns" he
heard his father call them one day, whatever that might mean) one
really could not love very much, Austrian though they were. For
euphonic reasons, too, he doted on Turenne.</p>

<p>This phase, which caused his parents anxiety, because it kept
him indoors when he ought to have been out, lasted through May and
half of June, till his father killed it by bringing home to him Tom
Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. When he read those books something
happened in him, and he went out of doors again in passionate quest
of a river. There being none on the premises at Robin Hill, he had
to make one out of the pond, which fortunately had water lilies,
dragonflies, gnats, bullrushes, and three small willow trees. On
this pond, after his father and Garratt had ascertained by sounding
that it had a reliable bottom and was nowhere more than two feet
deep, he was allowed a little collapsible canoe, in which he spent
hours and hours paddling, and lying down out of sight of Indian Joe
and other enemies. On the shore of the pond, too, he built himself
a wigwam about four feet square, of old biscuit tins, roofed in by
boughs. In this he would make little fires, and cook the birds he
had not shot with his gun, hunting in the coppice and fields, or
the fish he did not catch in the pond because there were none. This
occupied the rest of June and that July, when his father and mother
were away in Ireland. He led a lonely life of "make believe" during
those five weeks of summer weather, with gun, wigwam, water and
canoe; and, however hard his active little brain tried to keep the
sense of beauty away, she did creep in on him for a second now and
then, perching on the wing of a dragon-fly, glistening on the water
lilies, or brushing his eyes with her blue as he Jay on his back in
ambush.</p>

<p>"Auntie" June, who had been left in charge, had a "grown-up" in
the house, with a cough and a large piece of putty which he was
making into a face; so she hardly ever came down to see him in the
pond. Once, however, she brought with her two other "grown-ups."
Little Jon, who happened to have painted his naked self bright blue
and yellow in stripes out of his father's water-colour box, and put
some duck's feathers in his hair, saw them coming,
and&mdash;ambushed himself among the willows. As he had foreseen,
they came at once to his wigwam and knelt down to look inside, so
that with a blood-curdling yell he was able to take the scalps of
"Auntie" June and the woman "grown-up" in an almost complete manner
before they kissed him. The names of the two grown-ups were
"Auntie" Holly and "Uncle" Val, who had a brown face and a little
limp, and laughed at him terribly. He took a fancy to "Auntie"
Holly, who seemed to be a sister too; but they both went away the
same afternoon and he did not see them again. Three days before his
father and mother were to come home "Auntie" June also went off in
a great hurry, taking the "grown-up" who coughed and his piece of
putty; and Mademoiselle said: "Poor man, he was veree ill. I forbid
you to go into his room, Jon." Little Jon, who rarely did things
merely because he was told not to, refrained from going, though he
was bored and lonely. In truth the day of the pond was past, and he
was filled to the brim of his soul with restlessness and the want
of something&mdash;not a tree, not a gun&mdash;something soft.
Those last two days had seemed months in spite of Cast Up by the
Sea, wherein he was reading about Mother Lee and her terrible
wrecking bonfire. He had gone up and down the stairs perhaps a
hundred times in those two days, and often from the day nursery,
where he slept now, had stolen into his mother's room, looked at
everything, without touching, and on into the dressing-room; and
standing on one leg beside the bath, like Slingsby, had
whispered:</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho! Dog my cats!" mysteriously, to bring luck. Then,
stealing back, he had opened his mother's wardrobe, and taken a
long sniff which seemed to bring him nearer to&mdash;he didn't know
what.</p>

<p>He had done this just before he stood in the streak of sunlight,
debating in which of the several ways he should slide down the
banisters. They all seemed silly, and in a sudden languor he began
descending the steps one by one. During that descent he could
remember his father quite distinctly&mdash;the short grey beard,
the deep eyes twinkling, the furrow between them, the funny smile,
the thin figure which always seemed so tall to little Jon; but his
mother he couldn't see. All that represented her was something
swaying with two dark eyes looking back at him; and the scent of
her wardrobe.</p>

<p>Bella was in the hall, drawing aside the big curtains, and
opening the front door. Little Jon said, wheedling:</p>

<p>"Bella!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Master Jon."</p>

<p>"Do let's have tea under the oak tree when they come; I know
they'd like it best."</p>

<p>"You mean you'd like it best."</p>

<p>Little Jon considered.</p>

<p>"No, they would, to please me."</p>

<p>Bella smiled. "Very well, I'll take it out if you'll stay quiet
here and not get into mischief before they come."</p>

<p>Little Jon sat down on the bottom step, and nodded. Bella came
close, and looked him over.</p>

<p>"Get up!" she said.</p>

<p>Little Jon got up. She scrutinized him behind; he was not green,
and his knees seemed clean.</p>

<p>"All right!" she said. "My! Aren't you brown? Give me a
kiss!"</p>

<p>And little Jon received a peck on his hair.</p>

<p>"What jam?" he asked. "I'm so tired of waiting."</p>

<p>"Gooseberry and strawberry."</p>

<p>Num! They were his favourites!</p>

<p>When she was gone he sat still for quite a minute. It was quiet
in the big hall open to its East end so that he could see one of
his trees, a brig sailing very slowly across the upper lawn. In the
outer hall shadows were slanting from the pillars. Little Jon got
up, jumped one of them, and walked round the clump of iris plants
which filled the pool of grey-white marble in the centre. The
flowers were pretty, but only smelled a very little. He stood in
the open doorway and looked out. Suppose!&mdash;suppose they didn't
come! He had waited so long that he felt he could not bear that,
and his attention slid at once from such finality to the dust motes
in the bluish sunlight coming in: Thrusting his hand up, he tried
to catch some. Bella ought to have dusted that piece of air! But
perhaps they weren't dust&mdash;only what sunlight was made of, and
he looked to see whether the sunlight out of doors was the same. It
was not. He had said he would stay quiet in the hall, but he simply
couldn't any more; and crossing the gravel of the drive he lay down
on the grass beyond. Pulling six daisies he named them carefully,
Sir Lamorac, Sir Tristram, Sir Lancelot, Sir Palimedes, Sir Bors,
Sir Gawain, and fought them in couples till only Sir Lamorac, whom
he had selected for a specially stout stalk, had his head on, and
even he, after three encounters, looked worn and waggly. A beetle
was moving slowly in the grass, which almost wanted cutting. Every
blade was a small tree, round whose trunk the beetle had to glide.
Little Jon stretched out Sir Lamorac, feet foremost, and stirred
the creature up. It scuttled painfully. Little Jon laughed, lost
interest, and sighed. His heart felt empty. He turned over and lay
on his back. There was a scent of honey from the lime trees in
flower, and in the sky the blue was beautiful, with a few white
clouds which looked and perhaps tasted like lemon ice. He could
hear Bob playing: "Way down upon de Suwannee ribber" on his
concertina, and it made him nice and sad. He turned over again and
put his ear to the ground&mdash;Indians could hear things coming
ever so far&mdash;but he could hear nothing&mdash;only the
concertina! And almost instantly he did hear a grinding sound, a
faint toot. Yes! it was a car&mdash;coming&mdash;coming! Up he
jumped. Should he wait in the porch, or rush upstairs, and as they
came in, shout: "Look!" and slide slowly down the banisters, head
foremost? Should he? The car turned in at the drive. It was too
late! And he only waited, jumping up and down in his excitement.
The car came quickly, whirred, and stopped. His father got out,
exactly like life. He bent down and little Jon bobbed up&mdash;they
bumped. His father said:</p>

<p>"Bless us! Well, old man, you are brown!" Just as he would; and
the sense of expectation&mdash;of something wanted&mdash;bubbled
unextinguished in little Jon. Then, with a long, shy look he saw
his mother, in a blue dress, with a blue motor scarf over her cap
and hair, smiling. He jumped as high as ever he could, twined his
legs behind her back, and hugged. He heard her gasp, and felt her
hugging back. His eyes, very dark blue just then, looked into hers,
very dark brown, till her lips closed on his eyebrow, and,
squeezing with all his might, he heard her creak and laugh, and
say:</p>

<p>"You are strong, Jon!"</p>

<p>He slid down at that, and rushed into the hall, dragging her by
the hand.</p>

<p>While he was eating his jam beneath the oak tree, he noticed
things about his mother that he had never seemed to see before, her
cheeks for instance were creamy, there were silver threads in her
dark goldy hair, her throat had no knob in it like Bella's, and she
went in and out softly. He noticed, too, some little lines running
away from the corners of her eyes, and a nice darkness under them.
She was ever so beautiful, more beautiful than "Da" or
Mademoiselle, or "Auntie" June or even "Auntie" Holly, to whom he
had taken a fancy; even more beautiful than Bella, who had pink
cheeks and came out too suddenly in places. This new beautifulness
of his mother had a kind of particular importance, and he ate less
than he had expected to.</p>

<p>When tea was over his father wanted him to walk round the
gardens. He had a long conversation with his father about things in
general, avoiding his private life&mdash;Sir Lamorac, the
Austrians, and the emptiness he had felt these last three days, now
so suddenly filled up. His father told him of a place called
Glensofantrim, where he and his mother had been; and of the little
people who came out of the ground there when it was very quiet.
Little Jon came to a halt, with his heels apart.</p>

<p>"Do you really believe they do, Daddy?"</p>

<p>"No, Jon, but I thought you might."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You're younger than I; and they're fairies." Little Jon squared
the dimple in his chin.</p>

<p>"I don't believe in fairies. I never see any."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said his father.</p>

<p>"Does Mum?"</p>

<p>His father smiled his funny smile.</p>

<p>"No; she only sees Pan."</p>

<p>"What's Pan?"</p>

<p>"The Goaty God who skips about in wild and beautiful
places."</p>

<p>"Was he in Glensofantrim?"</p>

<p>"Mum said so."</p>

<p>Little Jon took his heels up, and led on.</p>

<p>"Did you see him?"</p>

<p>"No; I only saw Venus Anadyomene."</p>

<p>Little Jon reflected; Venus was in his book about the Greeks and
Trojans. Then Anna was her Christian and Dyomene her surname?</p>

<p>But it appeared, on inquiry, that it was one word, which meant
rising from the foam.</p>

<p>"Did she rise from the foam in Glensofantrim?"</p>

<p>"Yes; every day."</p>

<p>"What is she like, Daddy?"</p>

<p>"Like Mum."</p>

<p>"Oh! Then she must be..." but he stopped at that, rushed at a
wall, scrambled up, and promptly scrambled down again. The
discovery that his mother was beautiful was one which he felt must
absolutely be kept to himself. His father's cigar, however, took so
long to smoke, that at last he was compelled to say:</p>

<p>"I want to see what Mum's brought home. Do you mind, Daddy?"</p>

<p>He pitched the motive low, to absolve him from unmanliness, and
was a little disconcerted when his father looked at him right
through, heaved an important sigh, and answered:</p>

<p>"All right, old man, you go and love her."</p>

<p>He went, with a pretence of slowness, and then rushed, to make
up. He entered her bedroom from his own, the door being open. She
was still kneeling before a trunk, and he stood close to her, quite
still.</p>

<p>She knelt up straight, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, Jon?"</p>

<p>"I thought I'd just come and see."</p>

<p>Having given and received another hug, he mounted the
window-seat, and tucking his legs up under him watched her unpack.
He derived a pleasure from the operation such as he had not yet
known, partly because she was taking out things which looked
suspicious, and partly because he liked to look at her. She moved
differently from anybody else, especially from Bella; she was
certainly the refinedest-looking person he had ever seen. She
finished the trunk at last, and knelt down in front of him.</p>

<p>"Have you missed us, Jon?"</p>

<p>Little Jon nodded, and having thus admitted his feelings,
continued to nod.</p>

<p>"But you had 'Auntie' June?"</p>

<p>"Oh! she had a man with a cough."</p>

<p>His mother's face changed, and looked almost angry. He added
hastily:</p>

<p>"He was a poor man, Mum; he coughed awfully; I&mdash;I liked
him."</p>

<p>His mother put her hands behind his waist.</p>

<p>"You like everybody, Jon?"</p>

<p>Little Jon considered.</p>

<p>"Up to a point," he said: "Auntie June took me to church one
Sunday."</p>

<p>"To church? Oh!"</p>

<p>"She wanted to see how it would affect me."</p>

<p>"And did it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I came over all funny, so she took me home again very
quick. I wasn't sick after all. I went to bed and had hot brandy
and water, and read The Boys of Beechwood. It was scrumptious."</p>

<p>His mother bit her lip.</p>

<p>"When was that?"</p>

<p>"Oh! about&mdash;a long time ago&mdash;I wanted her to take me
again, but she wouldn't. You and Daddy never go to church, do
you?"</p>

<p>"No, we don't."</p>

<p>"Why don't you?"</p>

<p>His mother smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, dear, we both of us went when we were little. Perhaps we
went when we were too little."</p>

<p>"I see," said little Jon, "it's dangerous."</p>

<p>"You shall judge for yourself about all those things as you grow
up."</p>

<p>Little Jon replied in a calculating manner:</p>

<p>"I don't want to grow up, much. I don't want to go to school." A
sudden overwhelming desire to say something more, to say what he
really felt, turned him red. "I&mdash;I want to stay with you, and
be your lover, Mum."</p>

<p>Then with an instinct to improve the situation, he added quickly
"I don't want to go to bed to-night, either. I'm simply tired of
going to bed, every night."</p>

<p>"Have you had any more nightmares?"</p>

<p>"Only about one. May I leave the door open into your room
to-night, Mum?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just a little." Little Jon heaved a sigh of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"What did you see in Glensofantrim?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but beauty, darling."</p>

<p>"What exactly is beauty?"</p>

<p>"What exactly is&mdash;Oh! Jon, that's a poser."</p>

<p>"Can I see it, for instance?" His mother got up, and sat beside
him. "You do, every day. The sky is beautiful, the stars, and
moonlit nights, and then the birds, the flowers, the
trees&mdash;they're all beautiful. Look out of the
window&mdash;there's beauty for you, Jon."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, that's the view. Is that all?"</p>

<p>"All? no. The sea is wonderfully beautiful, and the waves, with
their foam flying back."</p>

<p>"Did you rise from it every day, Mum?"</p>

<p>His mother smiled. "Well, we bathed."</p>

<p>Little Jon suddenly reached out and caught her neck in his
hands.</p>

<p>"I know," he said mysteriously, "you're it, really, and all the
rest is make-believe."</p>

<p>She sighed, laughed, said: "Oh! Jon!"</p>

<p>Little Jon said critically:</p>

<p>"Do you think Bella beautiful, for instance? I hardly do."</p>

<p>"Bella is young; that's something."</p>

<p>"But you look younger, Mum. If you bump against Bella she
hurts."</p>

<p>"I don't believe 'Da' was beautiful, when I come to think of it;
and Mademoiselle's almost ugly."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle has a very nice face."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes; nice. I love your little rays, Mum."</p>

<p>"Rays?"</p>

<p>Little Jon put his finger to the outer corner of her eye.</p>

<p>"Oh! Those? But they're a sign of age."</p>

<p>"They come when you smile."</p>

<p>"But they usen't to."</p>

<p>"Oh! well, I like them. Do you love me, Mum?"</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;I do love you, darling."</p>

<p>"Ever so?"</p>

<p>"Ever so!"</p>

<p>"More than I thought you did?"</p>

<p>"Much&mdash;much more."</p>

<p>"Well, so do I; so that makes it even."</p>

<p>Conscious that he had never in his life so given himself away,
he felt a sudden reaction to the manliness of Sir Lamorac, Dick
Needham, Huck Finn, and other heroes.</p>

<p>"Shall I show you a thing or two?" he said; and slipping out of
her arms, he stood on his head. Then, fired by her obvious
admiration, he mounted the bed, and threw himself head foremost
from his feet on to his back, without touching anything with his
hands. He did this several times.</p>

<p>That evening, having inspected what they had brought, he stayed
up to dinner, sitting between them at the little round table they
used when they were alone. He was extremely excited. His mother
wore a French-grey dress, with creamy lace made out of little
scriggly roses, round her neck, which was browner than the lace. He
kept looking at her, till at last his father's funny smile made him
suddenly attentive to his slice of pineapple. It was later than he
had ever stayed up, when he went to bed. His mother went up with
him, and he undressed very slowly so as to keep her there. When at
last he had nothing on but his pyjamas, he said:</p>

<p>"Promise you won't go while I say my prayers!"</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>Kneeling down and plunging his face into the bed, little Jon
hurried up, under his breath, opening one eye now and then, to see
her standing perfectly still with a smile on her face. "Our
Father"&mdash;so went his last prayer, "which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy Mum, thy Kingdom Mum&mdash;on Earth as it is in
heaven, give us this day our daily Mum and forgive us our
trespasses on earth as it is in heaven and trespass against us, for
thine is the evil the power and the glory for ever and ever. Amum!
Look out!" He sprang, and for a long minute remained in her arms.
Once in bed, he continued to hold her hand.</p>

<p>"You won't shut the door any more than that, will you? Are you
going to be long, Mum?"</p>

<p>"I must go down and play to Daddy."</p>

<p>"Oh! well, I shall hear you."</p>

<p>"I hope not; you must go to sleep."</p>

<p>"I can sleep any night."</p>

<p>"Well, this is just a night like any other."</p>

<p>"Oh! no&mdash;it's extra special."</p>

<p>"On extra special nights one always sleeps soundest."</p>

<p>"But if I go to sleep, Mum, I shan't hear you come up."</p>

<p>"Well, when I do, I'll come in and give you a kiss, then if
you're awake you'll know, and if you're not you'll still know
you've had one."</p>

<p>Little Jon sighed, "All right!" he said: "I suppose I must put
up with that. Mum?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"What was her name that Daddy believes in? Venus Anna
Diomedes?"</p>

<p>"Oh! my angel! Anadyomene."</p>

<p>"Yes! but I like my name for you much better."</p>

<p>"What is yours, Jon?"</p>

<p>Little Jon answered shyly:</p>

<p>"Guinevere! it's out of the Round Table&mdash;I've only just
thought of it, only of course her hair was down."</p>

<p>His mother's eyes, looking past him, seemed to float.</p>

<p>"You won't forget to come, Mum?"</p>

<p>"Not if you'll go to sleep."</p>

<p>"That's a bargain, then." And little Jon screwed up his
eyes.</p>

<p>He felt her lips on his forehead, heard her footsteps; opened
his eyes to see her gliding through the doorway, and, sighing,
screwed them up again.</p>

<p>Then Time began.</p>

<p>For some ten minutes of it he tried loyally to sleep, counting a
great number of thistles in a row, "Da's" old recipe for bringing
slumber. He seemed to have been hours counting. It must, he
thought, be nearly time for her to come up now. He threw the
bedclothes back. "I'm hot!" he said, and his voice sounded funny in
the darkness, like someone else's. Why didn't she come? He sat up.
He must look! He got out of bed, went to the window and pulled the
curtain a slice aside. It wasn't dark, but he couldn't tell whether
because of daylight or the moon, which was very big. It had a
funny, wicked face, as if laughing at him, and he did not want to
look at it. Then, remembering that his mother had said moonlit
nights were beautiful, he continued to stare out in a general way.
The trees threw thick shadows, the lawn looked like spilt milk, and
a long, long way he could see; oh! very far; right over the world,
and it all looked different and swimmy. There was a lovely smell,
too, in his open window.</p>

<p>'I wish I had a dove like Noah!' he thought.</p>

<p>"The moony moon was round and bright, It shone and shone and
made it light."</p>

<p>After that rhyme, which came into his head all at once, he
became conscious of music, very soft-lovely! Mum playing! He
bethought himself of a macaroon he had, laid up in his chest of
drawers, and, getting it, came back to the window. He leaned out,
now munching, now holding his jaws to hear the music better. "Da"
used to say that angels played on harps in heaven; but it wasn't
half so lovely as Mum playing in the moony night, with him eating a
macaroon. A cockchafer buzzed by, a moth flew in his face, the
music stopped, and little Jon drew his head in. She must be coming!
He didn't want to be found awake. He got back into bed and pulled
the clothes nearly over his head; but he had left a streak of
moonlight coming in. It fell across the floor, near the foot of the
bed, and he watched it moving ever so slowly towards him, as if it
were alive. The music began again, but he could only just hear it
now; sleepy music,
pretty&mdash;sleepy&mdash;music&mdash;sleepy&mdash;slee....</p>

<p>And time slipped by, the music rose, fell, ceased; the moonbeam
crept towards his face. Little Jon turned in his sleep till he lay
on his back, with one brown fist still grasping the bedclothes. The
corners of his eyes twitched&mdash;he had begun to dream. He
dreamed he was drinking milk out of a pan that was the moon,
opposite a great black cat which watched him with a funny smile
like his father's. He heard it whisper: "Don't drink too much!" It
was the cat's milk, of course, and he put out his hand amicably to
stroke the creature; but it was no longer there; the pan had become
a bed, in which he was lying, and when he tried to get out he
couldn't find the edge; he couldn't find
it&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;couldn't get out! It was dreadful!</p>

<p>He whimpered in his sleep. The bed had begun to go round too; it
was outside him and inside him; going round and round, and getting
fiery, and Mother Lee out of Cast up by the Sea was stirring it!
Oh! so horrible she looked! Faster and faster!&mdash;till he and
the bed and Mother Lee and the moon and the cat were all one wheel
going round and round and up and
up&mdash;awful&mdash;awful&mdash;awful!</p>

<p>He shrieked.</p>

<p>A voice saying: "Darling, darling!" got through the wheel, and
he awoke, standing on his bed, with his eyes wide open.</p>

<p>There was his mother, with her hair like Guinevere's, and,
clutching her, he buried his face in it.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!"</p>

<p>"It's all right, treasure. You're awake now. There! There! It's
nothing!"</p>

<p>But little Jon continued to say: "Oh! oh!"</p>

<p>Her voice went on, velvety in his ear:</p>

<p>"It was the moonlight, sweetheart, coming on your face."</p>

<p>Little Jon burbled into her nightgown</p>

<p>"You said it was beautiful. Oh!"</p>

<p>"Not to sleep in, Jon. Who let it in? Did you draw the
curtains?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to see the time; I&mdash;I looked out, I&mdash;I heard
you playing, Mum; I&mdash;I ate my macaroon." But he was growing
slowly comforted; and the instinct to excuse his fear revived
within him.</p>

<p>"Mother Lee went round in me and got all fiery," he mumbled.</p>

<p>"Well, Jon, what can you expect if you eat macaroons after
you've gone to bed?"</p>

<p>"Only one, Mum; it made the music ever so more beautiful. I was
waiting for you&mdash;I nearly thought it was to-morrow."</p>

<p>"My ducky, it's only just eleven now."</p>

<p>Little Jon was silent, rubbing his nose on her neck.</p>

<p>"Mum, is Daddy in your room?"</p>

<p>"Not to-night."</p>

<p>"Can I come?"</p>

<p>"If you wish, my precious."</p>

<p>Half himself again, little Jon drew back.</p>

<p>"You look different, Mum; ever so younger."</p>

<p>"It's my hair, darling."</p>

<p>Little Jon laid hold of it, thick, dark gold, with a few silver
threads.</p>

<p>"I like it," he said: "I like you best of all like this."</p>

<p>Taking her hand, he had begun dragging her towards the door. He
shut it as they passed, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Which side of the bed do you like, Mum?"</p>

<p>"The left side."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>Wasting no time, giving her no chance to change her mind, little
Jon got into the bed, which seemed much softer than his own. He
heaved another sigh, screwed his head into the pillow and lay
examining the battle of chariots and swords and spears which always
went on outside blankets, where the little hairs stood up against
the light.</p>

<p>"It wasn't anything, really, was it?" he said.</p>

<p>From before her glass his mother answered:</p>

<p>"Nothing but the moon and your imagination heated up. You
mustn't get so excited, Jon."</p>

<p>But, still not quite in possession of his nerves, little Jon
answered boastfully:</p>

<p>"I wasn't afraid, really, of course!" And again he lay watching
the spears and chariots. It all seemed very long.</p>

<p>"Oh! Mum, do hurry up!"</p>

<p>"Darling, I have to plait my hair."</p>

<p>"Oh! not to-night. You'll only have to unplait it again
to-morrow. I'm sleepy now; if you don't come, I shan't be sleepy
soon."</p>

<p>His mother stood up white and flowey before the winged mirror:
he could see three of her, with her neck turned and her hair bright
under the light, and her dark eyes smiling. It was unnecessary, and
he said:</p>

<p>"Do come, Mum; I'm waiting."</p>

<p>"Very well, my love, I'll come."</p>

<p>Little Jon closed his eyes. Everything was turning out most
satisfactory, only she must hurry up! He felt the bed shake, she
was getting in. And, still with his eyes closed, he said sleepily:
"It's nice, isn't it?"</p>

<p>He heard her voice say something, felt her lips touching his
nose, and, snuggling up beside her who lay awake and loved him with
her thoughts, he fell into the dreamless sleep, which rounded off
his past.</p>

<h3>PART I</h3>

<hr>

<h3>I.&mdash;ENCOUNTER</h3>

<p>Soames Forsyte emerged from the Knightsbridge Hotel, where he
was staying, in the afternoon of the 12th of May, 1920, with the
intention of visiting a collection of pictures in a Gallery off
Cork Street, and looking into the Future. He walked. Since the War
he never took a cab if he could help it. Their drivers were, in his
view, an uncivil lot, though now that the War was over and supply
beginning to exceed demand again, getting more civil in accordance
with the custom of human nature. Still, he had not forgiven them,
deeply identifying them with gloomy memories, and now, dimly, like
all members, of their class, with revolution. The considerable
anxiety he had passed through during the War, and the more
considerable anxiety he had since undergone in the Peace, had
produced psychological consequences in a tenacious nature. He had,
mentally, so frequently experienced ruin, that he had ceased to
believe in its material probability. Paying away four thousand a
year in income and super tax, one could not very well be worse off!
A fortune of a quarter of a million, encumbered only by a wife and
one daughter, and very diversely invested, afforded substantial
guarantee even against that "wildcat notion" a levy on capital. And
as to confiscation of war profits, he was entirely in favour of it,
for he had none, and "serve the beggars right!" The price of
pictures, moreover, had, if anything, gone up, and he had done
better with his collection since the War began than ever before.
Air-raids, also, had acted beneficially on a spirit congenitally
cautious, and hardened a character already dogged. To be in danger
of being entirely dispersed inclined one to be less apprehensive of
the more partial dispersions involved in levies and taxation, while
the habit of condemning the impudence of the Germans had led
naturally to condemning that of Labour, if not openly at least in
the sanctuary of his soul.</p>

<p>He walked. There was, moreover, time to spare, for Fleur was to
meet him at the Gallery at four o'clock, and it was as yet but
half-past two. It was good for him to walk&mdash;his liver was a
little constricted, and his nerves rather on edge. His wife was
always out when she was in Town, and his daughter would
flibberty-gibbet all over the place like most young women since the
War. Still, he must be thankful that she had been too young to do
anything in that War itself. Not, of course, that he had not
supported the War from its inception, with all his soul, but
between that and supporting it with the bodies of his wife and
daughter, there had been a gap fixed by something old-fashioned
within him which abhorred emotional extravagance. He had, for
instance, strongly objected to Annette, so attractive, and in 1914
only thirty-four, going to her native France, her "chere patrie"
as, under the stimulus of war, she had begun to call it, to nurse
her "braves poilus," forsooth! Ruining her health and her looks! As
if she were really a nurse! He had put a stopper on it. Let her do
needlework for them at home, or knit! She had not gone, therefore,
and had never been quite the same woman since. A bad tendency of
hers to mock at him, not openly, but in continual little ways, had
grown. As for Fleur, the War had resolved the vexed problem whether
or not she should go to school. She was better away from her mother
in her war mood, from the chance of air-raids, and the impetus to
do extravagant things; so he had placed her in a seminary as far
West as had seemed to him compatible with excellence, and had
missed her horribly. Fleur! He had never regretted the somewhat
outlandish name by which at her birth he had decided so suddenly to
call her&mdash;marked concession though it had been to the French.
Fleur! A pretty name&mdash;a pretty child! But restless&mdash;too
restless; and wilful! Knowing her power too over her father! Soames
often reflected on the mistake it was to dote on his daughter. To
get old and dote! Sixty-five! He was getting on; but he didn't feel
it, for, fortunately perhaps, considering Annette's youth and good
looks, his second marriage had turned out a cool affair. He had
known but one real passion in his life&mdash;for that first wife of
his&mdash;Irene. Yes, and that fellow, his cousin Jolyon, who had
gone off with her, was looking very shaky, they said. No wonder, at
seventy-two, after twenty years of a third marriage!</p>

<p>Soames paused a moment in his march to lean over the railings of
the Row. A suitable spot for reminiscence, half-way between that
house in Park Lane which had seen his birth and his parents'
deaths, and the little house in Montpellier Square where
thirty-five years ago he had enjoyed his first edition of
matrimony. Now, after twenty years of his second edition, that old
tragedy seemed to him like a previous existence&mdash;which had
ended when Fleur was born in place of the son he had hoped for. For
many years he had ceased regretting, even vaguely, the son who had
not been born; Fleur filled the bill in his heart. After all, she
bore his name; and he was not looking forward at all to the time
when she would change it. Indeed, if he ever thought of such a
calamity, it was seasoned by the vague feeling that he could make
her rich enough to purchase perhaps and extinguish the name of the
fellow who married her&mdash;why not, since, as it seemed, women
were equal to men nowadays? And Soames, secretly convinced that
they were not, passed his curved hand over his face vigorously,
till it reached the comfort of his chin. Thanks to abstemious
habits, he had not grown fat and gabby; his nose was pale and thin,
his grey moustache close-clipped, his eyesight unimpaired. A slight
stoop closened and corrected the expansion given to his face by the
heightening of his forehead in the recession of his grey hair.
Little change had Time wrought in the "warmest" of the young
Forsytes, as the last of the old Forsytes&mdash;Timothy-now in his
hundred and first year, would have phrased it.</p>

<p>The shade from the plane-trees fell on his neat Homburg hat; he
had given up top hats&mdash;it was no use attracting attention to
wealth in days like these. Plane-trees! His thoughts travelled
sharply to Madrid&mdash;the Easter before the War, when, having to
make up his mind about that Goya picture, he had taken a voyage of
discovery to study the painter on his spot. The fellow had
impressed him&mdash;great range, real genius! Highly as the chap
ranked, he would rank even higher before they had finished with
him. The second Goya craze would be greater even than the first;
oh, yes! And he had bought. On that visit he had&mdash;as never
before&mdash;commissioned a copy of a fresco painting called "La
Vendimia," wherein was the figure of a girl with an arm akimbo, who
had reminded him of his daughter. He had it now in the Gallery at
Mapledurham, and rather poor it was&mdash;you couldn't copy Goya.
He would still look at it, however, if his daughter were not there,
for the sake of something irresistibly reminiscent in the light,
erect balance of the figure, the width between the arching
eyebrows, the eager dreaming of the dark eyes. Curious that Fleur
should have dark eyes, when his own were grey&mdash;no pure Forsyte
had brown eyes&mdash;and her mother's blue! But of course her
grandmother Lamotte's eyes were dark as treacle!</p>

<p>He began to walk on again toward Hyde Park Corner. No greater
change in all England than in the Row! Born almost within hail of
it, he could remember it from 1860 on. Brought there as a child
between the crinolines to stare at tight-trousered dandies in
whiskers, riding with a cavalry seat; to watch the doffing of
curly-brimmed and white top hats; the leisurely air of it all, and
the little bow-legged man in a long red waistcoat who used to come
among the fashion with dogs on several strings, and try to sell one
to his mother: King Charles spaniels, Italian greyhounds,
affectionate to her crinoline&mdash;you never saw them now. You saw
no quality of any sort, indeed, just working people sitting in dull
rows with nothing to stare at but a few young bouncing females in
pot hats, riding astride, or desultory Colonials charging up and
down on dismal-looking hacks; with, here and there, little girls on
ponies, or old gentlemen jogging their livers, or an orderly trying
a great galumphing cavalry horse; no thoroughbreds, no grooms, no
bowing, no scraping, no gossip&mdash;nothing; only the trees the
same&mdash;the trees in&mdash;different to the generations and
declensions of mankind. A democratic England&mdash;dishevelled,
hurried, noisy, and seemingly without an apex. And that something
fastidious in the soul of Soames turned over within him. Gone
forever, the close borough of rank and polish! Wealth there
was&mdash;oh, yes! wealth&mdash;he himself was a richer man than
his father had ever been; but manners, flavour, quality, all gone,
engulfed in one vast, ugly, shoulder-rubbing, petrol-smelling
Cheerio. Little half-beaten pockets of gentility and caste lurking
here and there, dispersed and chetif, as Annette would say; but
nothing ever again firm and coherent to look up to. And into this
new hurly-burly of bad manners and loose morals his
daughter&mdash;flower of his life&mdash;was flung! And when those
Labour chaps got power&mdash;if they ever did&mdash;the worst was
yet to come.</p>

<p>He passed out under the archway, at last no longer&mdash;thank
goodness!&mdash;disfigured by the gungrey of its search-light.
'They'd better put a search-light on to where they're all going,'
he thought, 'and light up their precious democracy!' And he
directed his steps along the Club fronts of Piccadilly. George
Forsyte, of course, would be sitting in the bay window of the
Iseeum. The chap was so big now that he was there nearly all his
time, like some immovable, sardonic, humorous eye noting the
decline of men and things. And Soames hurried, ever
constitutionally uneasy beneath his cousin's glance. George, who,
as he had heard, had written a letter signed "Patriot" in the
middle of the War, complaining of the Government's hysteria in
docking the oats of race-horses. Yes, there he was, tall,
ponderous, neat, clean-shaven, with his smooth hair, hardly
thinned, smelling, no doubt, of the best hair-wash, and a pink
paper in his hand. Well, he didn't change! And for perhaps the
first time in his life Soames felt a kind of sympathy tapping in
his waistcoat for that sardonic kinsman. With his weight, his
perfectly parted hair, and bull-like gaze, he was a guarantee that
the old order would take some shifting yet. He saw George move the
pink paper as if inviting him to ascend&mdash;the chap must want to
ask something about his property. It was still under Soames'
control; for in the adoption of a sleeping partnership at that
painful period twenty years back when he had divorced Irene, Soames
had found himself almost insensibly retaining control of all purely
Forsyte affairs.</p>

<p>Hesitating for just a moment, he nodded and went in. Since the
death of his brother-in-law Montague Dartie, in Paris, which no one
had quite known what to make of, except that it was certainly not
suicide&mdash;the Iseeum Club had seemed more respectable to
Soames. George, too, he knew, had sown the last of his wild oats,
and was committed definitely to the joys of the table, eating only
of the very best so as to keep his weight down, and owning, as he
said, "just one or two old screws to give me an interest in life."
He joined his cousin, therefore, in the bay window without the
embarrassing sense of indiscretion he had been used to feel up
there. George put out a well-kept hand.</p>

<p>"Haven't seen you since the War," he said. "How's your
wife?"</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Soames coldly, "well enough."</p>

<p>Some hidden jest curved, for a moment, George's fleshy face, and
gloated from his eye.</p>

<p>"That Belgian chap, Profond," he said, "is a member here now.
He's a rum customer."</p>

<p>"Quite!" muttered Soames. "What did you want to see me
about?"</p>

<p>"Old Timothy; he might go off the hooks at any moment. I suppose
he's made his Will."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, you or somebody ought to give him a look up&mdash;last of
the old lot; he's a hundred, you know. They say he's like a rummy.
Where are you goin' to put him? He ought to have a pyramid by
rights."</p>

<p>Soames shook his head. "Highgate, the family vault."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose the old girls would miss him, if he was
anywhere else. They say he still takes an interest in food. He
might last on, you know. Don't we get anything for the old
Forsytes? Ten of them&mdash;average age eighty-eight&mdash;I worked
it out. That ought to be equal to triplets."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said Soames, "I must be getting on."</p>

<p>'You unsociable devil,' George's eyes seemed to answer. "Yes,
that's all: Look him up in his mausoleum&mdash;the old chap might
want to prophesy." The grin died on the rich curves of his face,
and he added: "Haven't you attorneys invented a way yet of dodging
this damned income tax? It hits the fixed inherited income like the
very deuce. I used to have two thousand five hundred a year; now
I've got a beggarly fifteen hundred, and the price of living
doubled."</p>

<p>"Ah!" murmured Soames, "the turf's in danger."</p>

<p>Over George's face moved a gleam of sardonic self-defence.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "they brought me up to do nothing, and here I
am in the sear and yellow, getting poorer every day. These Labour
chaps mean to have the lot before they've done. What are you going
to do for a living when it comes? I shall work a six-hour day
teaching politicians how to see a joke. Take my tip, Soames; go
into Parliament, make sure of your four hundred&mdash;and employ
me."</p>

<p>And, as Soames retired, he resumed his seat in the bay
window.</p>

<p>Soames moved along Piccadilly deep in reflections excited by his
cousin's words. He himself had always been a worker and a saver,
George always a drone and a spender; and yet, if confiscation once
began, it was he&mdash;the worker and the saver&mdash;who would be
looted! That was the negation of all virtue, the overturning of all
Forsyte principles. Could civilization be built on any other? He
did not think so. Well, they wouldn't confiscate his pictures, for
they wouldn't know their worth. But what would they be worth, if
these maniacs once began to milk capital? A drug on the market. 'I
don't care about myself,' he thought; 'I could live on five hundred
a year, and never know the difference, at my age.' But Fleur! This
fortune, so widely invested, these treasures so carefully chosen
and amassed, were all for&mdash;her. And if it should turn out that
he couldn't give or leave them to her&mdash;well, life had no
meaning, and what was the use of going in to look at this crazy,
futuristic stuff with the view of seeing whether it had any
future?</p>

<p>Arriving at the Gallery off Cork Street, however, he paid his
shilling, picked up a catalogue, and entered. Some ten persons were
prowling round. Soames took steps and came on what looked to him
like a lamp-post bent by collision with a motor omnibus. It was
advanced some three paces from the wall, and was described in his
catalogue as "Jupiter." He examined it with curiosity, having
recently turned some of his attention to sculpture. 'If that's
Jupiter,' he thought, 'I wonder what Juno's like.' And suddenly he
saw her, opposite. She appeared to him like nothing so much as a
pump with two handles, lightly clad in snow. He was still gazing at
her, when two of the prowlers halted on his left. "Epatant!" he
heard one say.</p>

<p>"Jargon!" growled Soames to himself.</p>

<p>The other's boyish voice replied</p>

<p>"Missed it, old bean; he's pulling your leg. When Jove and Juno
created he them, he was saying: 'I'll see how much these fools will
swallow.' And they've lapped up the lot."</p>

<p>"You young duffer! Vospovitch is an innovator. Don't you see
that he's brought satire into sculpture? The future of plastic art,
of music, painting, and even architecture, has set in satiric. It
was bound to. People are tired&mdash;the bottom's tumbled out of
sentiment."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm quite equal to taking a little interest in beauty. I
was through the War. You've dropped your handkerchief, sir."</p>

<p>Soames saw a handkerchief held out in front of him. He took it
with some natural suspicion, and approached it to his nose. It had
the right scent&mdash;of distant Eau de Cologne&mdash;and his
initials in a corner. Slightly reassured, he raised his eyes to the
young man's face. It had rather fawn-like ears, a laughing mouth,
with half a toothbrush growing out of it on each side, and small
lively eyes, above a normally dressed appearance.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said; and moved by a sort of irritation, added:
"Glad to hear you like beauty; that's rare, nowadays."</p>

<p>"I dote on it," said the young man; "but you and I are the last
of the old guard, sir."</p>

<p>Soames smiled.</p>

<p>"If you really care for pictures," he said, "here's my card. I
can show you some quite good ones any Sunday, if you're down the
river and care to look in."</p>

<p>"Awfully nice of you, sir. I'll drop in like a bird. My name's
Mont-Michael." And he took off his hat.</p>

<p>Soames, already regretting his impulse, raised his own slightly
in response, with a downward look at the young man's companion, who
had a purple tie, dreadful little sluglike whiskers, and a scornful
look&mdash;as if he were a poet!</p>

<p>It was the first indiscretion he had committed for so long that
he went and sat down in an alcove. What had possessed him to give
his card to a rackety young fellow, who went about with a thing
like that? And Fleur, always at the back of his thoughts, started
out like a filigree figure from a clock when the hour strikes. On
the screen opposite the alcove was a large canvas with a great many
square tomato-coloured blobs on it, and nothing else, so far as
Soames could see from where he sat. He looked at his catalogue:
"No. 32 'The Future Town'&mdash;Paul Post." 'I suppose that's
satiric too,' he thought. 'What a thing!' But his second impulse
was more cautious. It did not do to condemn hurriedly. There had
been those stripey, streaky creations of Monet's, which had turned
out such trumps; and then the stippled school; and Gauguin. Why,
even since the Post-Impressionists there had been one or two
painters not to be sneezed at. During the thirty-eight years of his
connoisseur's life, indeed, he had marked so many "movements," seen
the tides of taste and technique so ebb and flow, that there was
really no telling anything except that there was money to be made
out of every change of fashion. This too might quite well be a case
where one must subdue primordial instinct, or lose the market. He
got up and stood before the picture, trying hard to see it with the
eyes of other people. Above the tomato blobs was what he took to be
a sunset, till some one passing said: "He's got the airplanes
wonderfully, don't you think!" Below the tomato blobs was a band of
white with vertical black stripes, to which he could assign no
meaning whatever, till some one else came by, murmuring: "What
expression he gets with his foreground!" Expression? Of what?
Soames went back to his seat. The thing was "rich," as his father
would have said, and he wouldn't give a damn for it. Expression!
Ah! they were all Expressionists now, he had heard, on the
Continent. So it was coming here too, was it? He remembered the
first wave of influenza in 1887&mdash;or '8&mdash;hatched in China,
so they said. He wondered where this&mdash;this Expressionism had
been hatched. The thing was a regular disease!</p>

<p>He had become conscious of a woman and a youth standing between
him and the "Future Town." Their backs were turned; but very
suddenly Soames put his catalogue before his face, and drawing his
hat forward, gazed through the slit between. No mistaking that
back, elegant as ever though the hair above had gone grey. Irene!
His divorced wife&mdash;Irene! And this, no doubt, was&mdash;her
son&mdash;by that fellow Jolyon Forsyte&mdash;their boy, six months
older than his own girl! And mumbling over in his mind the bitter
days of his divorce, he rose to get out of sight, but quickly sat
down again. She had turned her head to speak to her boy; her
profile was still so youthful that it made her grey hair seem
powdery, as if fancy-dressed; and her lips were smiling as Soames,
first possessor of them, had never seen them smile. Grudgingly he
admitted her still beautiful and in figure almost as young as ever.
And how that boy smiled back at her! Emotion squeezed Soames'
heart. The sight infringed his sense of justice. He grudged her
that boy's smile&mdash;it went beyond what Fleur gave him, and it
was undeserved. Their son might have been his son; Fleur might have
been her daughter, if she had kept straight! He lowered his
catalogue. If she saw him, all the better! A reminder of her
conduct in the presence of her son, who probably knew nothing of
it, would be a salutary touch from the finger of that Nemesis which
surely must soon or late visit her! Then, half-conscious that such
a thought was extravagant for a Forsyte of his age, Soames took out
his watch. Past four! Fleur was late. She had gone to his niece
Imogen Cardigan's, and there they would keep her smoking cigarettes
and gossiping, and that. He heard the boy laugh, and say eagerly:
"I say, Mum, is this by one of Auntie June's lame ducks?"</p>

<p>"Paul Post&mdash;I believe it is, darling."</p>

<p>The word produced a little shock in Soames; he had never heard
her use it. And then she saw him. His eyes must have had in them
something of George Forsyte's sardonic look; for her gloved hand
crisped the folds of her frock, her eyebrows rose, her face went
stony. She moved on.</p>

<p>"It is a caution," said the boy, catching her arm again.</p>

<p>Soames stared after them. That boy was good-looking, with a
Forsyte chin, and eyes deep-grey, deep in; but with something
sunny, like a glass of old sherry spilled over him; his smile
perhaps, his hair. Better than they deserved&mdash;those two! They
passed from his view into the next room, and Soames continued to
regard the Future Town, but saw it not. A little smile snarled up
his lips. He was despising the vehemence of his own feelings after
all these years. Ghosts! And yet as one grew old&mdash;was there
anything but what was ghost-like left? Yes, there was Fleur! He
fixed his eyes on the entrance. She was due; but she would keep him
waiting, of course! And suddenly he became aware of a sort of human
breeze&mdash;a short, slight form clad in a sea-green djibbah with
a metal belt and a fillet binding unruly red-gold hair all streaked
with grey. She was talking to the Gallery attendants, and something
familiar riveted his gaze&mdash;in her eyes, her chin, her hair,
her spirit&mdash;something which suggested a thin Skye terrier just
before its dinner. Surely June Forsyte! His cousin June&mdash;and
coming straight to his recess! She sat down beside him, deep in
thought, took out a tablet, and made a pencil note. Soames sat
unmoving. A confounded thing, cousinship! "Disgusting!" he heard
her murmur; then, as if resenting the presence of an overhearing
stranger, she looked at him. The worst had happened.</p>

<p>"Soames!"</p>

<p>Soames turned his head a very little.</p>

<p>"How are you?" he said. "Haven't seen you for twenty years."</p>

<p>"No. Whatever made you come here?"</p>

<p>"My sins," said Soames. "What stuff!"</p>

<p>"Stuff? Oh, yes&mdash;of course; it hasn't arrived yet.</p>

<p>"It never will," said Soames; "it must be making a dead
loss."</p>

<p>"Of course it is."</p>

<p>"How d'you know?"</p>

<p>"It's my Gallery."</p>

<p>Soames sniffed from sheer surprise.</p>

<p>"Yours? What on earth makes you run a show like this?"</p>

<p>"I don't treat Art as if it were grocery."</p>

<p>Soames pointed to the Future Town. "Look at that! Who's going to
live in a town like that, or with it on his walls?"</p>

<p>June contemplated the picture for a moment.</p>

<p>"It's a vision," she said.</p>

<p>"The deuce!"</p>

<p>There was silence, then June rose. 'Crazylooking creature!' he
thought.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "you'll find your young stepbrother here with a
woman I used to know. If you take my advice, you'll close this
exhibition."</p>

<p>June looked back at him. "Oh! You Forsyte!" she said, and moved
on. About her light, fly-away figure, passing so suddenly away, was
a look of dangerous decisions. Forsyte! Of course, he was a
Forsyte! And so was she! But from the time when, as a mere girl,
she brought Bosinney into his life to wreck it, he had never hit it
off with June and never would! And here she was, unmarried to this
day, owning a Gallery!...And suddenly it came to Soames how little
he knew now of his own family. The old aunts at Timothy's had been
dead so many years; there was no clearing-house for news. What had
they all done in the War? Young Roger's boy had been wounded, St.
John Hayman's second son killed; young Nicholas' eldest had got an
O. B. E., or whatever they gave them. They had all joined up
somehow, he believed. That boy of Jolyon's and Irene's, he
supposed, had been too young; his own generation, of course, too
old, though Giles Hayman had driven a car for the Red
Cross&mdash;and Jesse Hayman been a special constable&mdash;those
"Dromios" had always been of a sporting type! As for himself, he
had given a motor ambulance, read the papers till he was sick of
them, passed through much anxiety, bought no clothes, lost seven
pounds in weight; he didn't know what more he could have done at
his age. Indeed, thinking it over, it struck him that he and his
family had taken this war very differently to that affair with the
Boers, which had been supposed to tax all the resources of the
Empire. In that old war, of course, his nephew Val Dartie had been
wounded, that fellow Jolyon's first son had died of enteric, "the
Dromios" had gone out on horses, and June had been a nurse; but all
that had seemed in the nature of a portent, while in this war
everybody had done "their bit," so far as he could make out, as a
matter of course. It seemed to show the growth of something or
other&mdash;or perhaps the decline of something else. Had the
Forsytes become less individual, or more Imperial, or less
provincial? Or was it simply that one hated Germans?...Why didn't
Fleur come, so that he could get away? He saw those three return
together from the other room and pass back along the far side of
the screen. The boy was standing before the Juno now. And,
suddenly, on the other side of her, Soames saw&mdash;his daughter,
with eyebrows raised, as well they might be. He could see her eyes
glint sideways at the boy, and the boy look back at her. Then Irene
slipped her hand through his arm, and drew him on. Soames saw him
glancing round, and Fleur looking after them as the three went
out.</p>

<p>A voice said cheerfully: "Bit thick, isn't it, sir?"</p>

<p>The young man who had handed him his handkerchief was again
passing. Soames nodded.</p>

<p>"I don't know what we're coming to."</p>

<p>"Oh! That's all right, sir," answered the young man cheerfully;
"they don't either."</p>

<p>Fleur's voice said: "Hallo, Father! Here you are!" precisely as
if he had been keeping her waiting.</p>

<p>The young man, snatching off his hat, passed on.</p>

<p>"Well," said Soames, looking her up and down, "you're a punctual
sort of young woman!"</p>

<p>This treasured possession of his life was of medium height and
colour, with short, dark chestnut hair; her wide-apart brown eyes
were set in whites so clear that they glinted when they moved, and
yet in repose were almost dreamy under very white, black-lashed
lids, held over them in a sort of suspense. She had a charming
profile, and nothing of her father in her face save a decided chin.
Aware that his expression was softening as he looked at her, Soames
frowned to preserve the unemotionalism proper to a Forsyte. He knew
she was only too inclined to take advantage of his weakness.</p>

<p>Slipping her hand under his arm, she said:</p>

<p>"Who was that?"</p>

<p>"He picked up my handkerchief. We talked about the
pictures."</p>

<p>"You're not going to buy that, Father?"</p>

<p>"No," said Soames grimly; "nor that Juno you've been looking
at."</p>

<p>Fleur dragged at his arm. "Oh! Let's go! It's a ghastly
show."</p>

<p>In the doorway they passed the young man called Mont and his
partner. But Soames had hung out a board marked "Trespassers will
be prosecuted," and he barely acknowledged the young fellow's
salute.</p>

<p>"Well," he said in the street, "whom did you meet at
Imogen's?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Winifred, and that Monsieur Profond."</p>

<p>"Oh!" muttered Soames; "that chap! What does your aunt see in
him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He looks pretty deep&mdash;mother says she likes
him."</p>

<p>Soames grunted.</p>

<p>"Cousin Val and his wife were there, too."</p>

<p>"What!" said Soames. "I thought they were back in South
Africa."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! They've sold their farm. Cousin Val is going to train
race-horses on the Sussex Downs. They've got a jolly old
manor-house; they asked me down there."</p>

<p>Soames coughed: the news was distasteful to him. "What's his
wife like now?"</p>

<p>"Very quiet, but nice, I think."</p>

<p>Soames coughed again. "He's a rackety chap, your Cousin
Val."</p>

<p>"Oh! no, Father; they're awfully devoted. I promised to
go&mdash;Saturday to Wednesday next."</p>

<p>"Training race-horses!" said Soames. It was extravagant, but not
the reason for his distaste. Why the deuce couldn't his nephew have
stayed out in South Africa? His own divorce had been bad enough,
without his nephew's marriage to the daughter of the co-respondent;
a half-sister too of June, and of that boy whom Fleur had just been
looking at from under the pump-handle. If he didn't look out, she
would come to know all about that old disgrace! Unpleasant things!
They were round him this afternoon like a swarm of bees!</p>

<p>"I don't like it!" he said.</p>

<p>"I want to see the race-horses," murmured Fleur; "and they've
promised I shall ride. Cousin Val can't walk much, you know; but he
can ride perfectly. He's going to show me their gallops."</p>

<p>"Racing!" said Soames. "It's a pity the War didn't knock that on
the head. He's taking after his father, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about his father."</p>

<p>"No," said Soames, grimly. "He took an interest in horses and
broke his neck in Paris, walking down-stairs. Good riddance for
your aunt." He frowned, recollecting the inquiry into those stairs
which he had attended in Paris six years ago, because Montague
Dartie could not attend it himself&mdash;perfectly normal stairs in
a house where they played baccarat. Either his winnings or the way
he had celebrated them had gone to his brother-in-law's head. The
French procedure had been very loose; he had had a lot of trouble
with it.</p>

<p>A sound from Fleur distracted his attention. "Look! The people
who were in the Gallery with us."</p>

<p>"What people?" muttered Soames, who knew perfectly well.</p>

<p>"I think that woman's beautiful."</p>

<p>"Come into this pastry-cook's," said Soames abruptly, and
tightening his grip on her arm he turned into a confectioner's. It
was&mdash;for him&mdash;a surprising thing to do, and he said
rather anxiously: "What will you have?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't want anything. I had a cocktail and a tremendous
lunch."</p>

<p>"We must have something now we're here," muttered Soames,
keeping hold of her arm.</p>

<p>"Two teas," he said; "and two of those nougat things."</p>

<p>But no sooner was his body seated than his soul sprang up. Those
three&mdash;those three were coming in! He heard Irene say
something to her boy, and his answer:</p>

<p>"Oh! no, Mum; this place is all right. My stunt." And the three
sat down.</p>

<p>At that moment, most awkward of his existence, crowded with
ghosts and shadows from his past, in presence of the only two women
he had ever loved&mdash;his divorced wife and his daughter by her
successor&mdash;Soames was not so much afraid of them as of his
cousin June. She might make a scene&mdash;she might introduce those
two children&mdash;she was capable of anything. He bit too hastily
at the nougat, and it stuck to his plate. Working at it with his
finger, he glanced at Fleur. She was masticating dreamily, but her
eyes were on the boy. The Forsyte in him said: "Think, feel, and
you're done for!" And he wiggled his finger desperately. Plate! Did
Jolyon wear a plate? Did that woman wear a plate? Time had been
when he had seen her wearing nothing! That was something, anyway,
which had never been stolen from him. And she knew it, though she
might sit there calm and self-possessed, as if she had never been
his wife. An acid humour stirred in his Forsyte blood; a subtle
pain divided by hair's breadth from pleasure. If only June did not
suddenly bring her hornets about his ears! The boy was talking.</p>

<p>"Of course, Auntie June"&mdash;so he called his half-sister
"Auntie," did he?&mdash;well, she must be fifty, if she was a
day!&mdash;"it's jolly good of you to encourage them.
Only&mdash;hang it all!" Soames stole a glance. Irene's startled
eyes were bent watchfully on her boy. She&mdash;she had these
devotions&mdash;for Bosinney&mdash;for that boy's father&mdash;for
this boy! He touched Fleur's arm, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, have you had enough?"</p>

<p>"One more, Father, please."</p>

<p>She would be sick! He went to the counter to pay. When he turned
round again he saw Fleur standing near the door, holding a
handkerchief which the boy had evidently just handed to her.</p>

<p>"F. F.," he heard her say. "Fleur Forsyte&mdash;it's mine all
right. Thank you ever so."</p>

<p>Good God! She had caught the trick from what he'd told her in
the Gallery&mdash;monkey!</p>

<p>"Forsyte? Why&mdash;that's my name too. Perhaps we're
cousins."</p>

<p>"Really! We must be. There aren't any others. I live at
Mapledurham; where do you?"</p>

<p>"Robin Hill."</p>

<p>Question and answer had been so rapid that all was over before
he could lift a finger. He saw Irene's face alive with startled
feeling, gave the slightest shake of his head, and slipped his arm
through Fleur's.</p>

<p>"Come along!" he said.</p>

<p>She did not move.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear, Father? Isn't it queer&mdash;our name's the
same. Are we cousins?"</p>

<p>"What's that?" he said. "Forsyte? Distant, perhaps."</p>

<p>"My name's Jolyon, sir. Jon, for short."</p>

<p>"Oh! Ah!" said Soames. "Yes. Distant. How are you? Very good of
you. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>He moved on.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully," Fleur was saying. "Au revoir!"</p>

<p>"Au revoir!" he heard the boy reply.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.&mdash;FINE FLEUR FORSYTE</h3>

<p>Emerging from the "pastry-cook's," Soames' first impulse was to
vent his nerves by saying to his daughter: 'Dropping your
hand-kerchief!' to which her reply might well be: 'I picked that up
from you!' His second impulse therefore was to let sleeping dogs
lie. But she would surely question him. He gave her a sidelong
look, and found she was giving him the same. She said softly:</p>

<p>"Why don't you like those cousins, Father?" Soames lifted the
corner of his lip.</p>

<p>"What made you think that?"</p>

<p>"Cela se voit."</p>

<p>'That sees itself!' What a way of putting it! After twenty years
of a French wife Soames had still little sympathy with her
language; a theatrical affair and connected in his mind with all
the refinements of domestic irony.</p>

<p>"How?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You must know them; and you didn't make a sign. I saw them
looking at you."</p>

<p>"I've never seen the boy in my life," replied Soames with
perfect truth.</p>

<p>"No; but you've seen the others, dear."</p>

<p>Soames gave her another look. What had she picked up? Had her
Aunt Winifred, or Imogen, or Val Dartie and his wife, been talking?
Every breath of the old scandal had been carefully kept from her at
home, and Winifred warned many times that he wouldn't have a
whisper of it reach her for the world. So far as she ought to know,
he had never been married before. But her dark eyes, whose southern
glint and clearness often almost frightened him, met his with
perfect innocence.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "your grandfather and his brother had a
quarrel. The two families don't know each other."</p>

<p>"How romantic!"</p>

<p>'Now, what does she mean by that?' he thought. The word was to
him extravagant and dangerous&mdash;it was as if she had said: "How
jolly!"</p>

<p>"And they'll continue not to know each, other," he added, but
instantly regretted the challenge in those words. Fleur was
smiling. In this age, when young people prided themselves on going
their own ways and paying no attention to any sort of decent
prejudice, he had said the very thing to excite her wilfulness.
Then, recollecting the expression on Irene's face, he breathed
again.</p>

<p>"What sort of a quarrel?" he heard Fleur say.</p>

<p>"About a house. It's ancient history for you. Your grandfather
died the day you were born. He was ninety."</p>

<p>"Ninety? Are there many Forsytes besides those in the Red
Book?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Soames. "They're all dispersed now. The old
ones are dead, except Timothy."</p>

<p>Fleur clasped her hands.</p>

<p>"Timothy? Isn't that delicious?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Soames. It offended him that she should think
"Timothy" delicious&mdash;a kind of insult to his breed. This new
generation mocked at anything solid and tenacious. "You go and see
the old boy. He might want to prophesy." Ah! If Timothy could see
the disquiet England of his great-nephews and great-nieces, he
would certainly give tongue. And involuntarily he glanced up at the
Iseeum; yes&mdash;George was still in the window, with the same
pink paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"Where is Robin Hill, Father?"</p>

<p>Robin Hill! Robin Hill, round which all that tragedy had
centred! What did she want to know for?</p>

<p>"In Surrey," he muttered; "not far from Richmond. Why?"</p>

<p>"Is the house there?"</p>

<p>"What house?"</p>

<p>"That they quarrelled about."</p>

<p>"Yes. But what's all that to do with you? We're going home
to-morrow&mdash;you'd better be thinking about your frocks."</p>

<p>"Bless you! They're all thought about. A family feud? It's like
the Bible, or Mark Twain&mdash;awfully exciting. What did you do in
the feud, Father?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind."</p>

<p>"Oh! But if I'm to keep it up?"</p>

<p>"Who said you were to keep it up?"</p>

<p>"You, darling."</p>

<p>"I? I said it had nothing to do with you."</p>

<p>"Just what I think, you know; so that's all right."</p>

<p>She was too sharp for him; fine, as Annette sometimes called
her. Nothing for it but to distract her attention.</p>

<p>"There's a bit of rosaline point in here," he said, stopping
before a shop, "that I thought you might like."</p>

<p>When he had paid for it and they had resumed their progress,
Fleur said:</p>

<p>"Don't you think that boy's mother is the most beautiful woman
of her age you've ever seen?"</p>

<p>Soames shivered. Uncanny, the way she stuck to it!</p>

<p>"I don't know that I noticed her."</p>

<p>"Dear, I saw the corner of your eye."</p>

<p>"You see everything&mdash;and a great deal more, it seems to
me!"</p>

<p>"What's her husband like? He must be your first cousin, if your
fathers were brothers."</p>

<p>"Dead, for all I know," said Soames, with sudden vehemence. "I
haven't seen him for twenty years."</p>

<p>"What was he?"</p>

<p>"A painter."</p>

<p>"That's quite jolly."</p>

<p>The words: "If you want to please me you'll put those people out
of your head," sprang to Soames' lips, but he choked them
back&mdash;he must not let her see his feelings.</p>

<p>"He once insulted me," he said.</p>

<p>Her quick eyes rested on his face.</p>

<p>"I see! You didn't avenge it, and it rankles. Poor Father! You
let me have a go!"</p>

<p>It was really like lying in the dark with a mosquito hovering
above his face. Such pertinacity in Fleur was new to him, and, as
they reached the hotel, he said grimly:</p>

<p>"I did my best. And that's enough about these people. I'm going
up till dinner."</p>

<p>"I shall sit here."</p>

<p>With a parting look at her extended in a chair&mdash;a look
half-resentful, half-adoring&mdash;Soames moved into the lift and
was transported to their suite on the fourth floor. He stood by the
window of the sitting-room which gave view over Hyde Park, and
drummed a finger on its pane. His feelings were confused, tetchy,
troubled. The throb of that old wound, scarred over by Time and new
interests, was mingled with displeasure and anxiety, and a slight
pain in his chest where that nougat stuff had disagreed. Had
Annette come in? Not that she was any good to him in such a
difficulty. Whenever she had questioned him about his first
marriage, he had always shut her up; she knew nothing of it, save
that it had been the great passion of his life, and his marriage
with herself but domestic makeshift. She had always kept the grudge
of that up her sleeve, as it were, and used it commercially. He
listened. A sound&mdash;the vague murmur of a woman's
movements&mdash;was coming through the door. She was in. He
tapped.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"I," said Soames.</p>

<p>She had been changing her frock, and was still imperfectly
clothed; a striking figure before her glass. There was a certain
magnificence about her arms, shoulders, hair, which had darkened
since he first knew her, about the turn of her neck, the silkiness
of her garments, her dark-lashed, greyblue eyes&mdash;she was
certainly as handsome at forty as she had ever been. A fine
possession, an excellent housekeeper, a sensible and affectionate
enough mother. If only she weren't always so frankly cynical about
the relations between them! Soames, who had no more real affection
for her than she had for him, suffered from a kind of English
grievance in that she had never dropped even the thinnest veil of
sentiment over their partnership. Like most of his countrymen and
women, he held the view that marriage should be based on mutual
love, but that when from a marriage love had disappeared, or, been
found never to have really existed&mdash;so that it was manifestly
not based on love&mdash;you must not admit it. There it was, and
the love was not&mdash;but there you were, and must continue to be!
Thus you had it both ways, and were not tarred with cynicism,
realism, and immorality like the French. Moreover, it was necessary
in the interests of property. He knew that she knew that they both
knew there was no love between them, but he still expected her not
to admit in words or conduct such a thing, and he could never
understand what she meant when she talked of the hypocrisy of the
English. He said:</p>

<p>"Whom have you got at 'The Shelter' next week?"</p>

<p>Annette went on touching her lips delicately with salve&mdash;he
always wished she wouldn't do that.</p>

<p>"Your sister Winifred, and the Car-r-digans"&mdash;she took up a
tiny stick of black&mdash;"and Prosper Profond."</p>

<p>"That Belgian chap? Why him?"</p>

<p>Annette turned her neck lazily, touched one eyelash, and
said:</p>

<p>"He amuses Winifred."</p>

<p>"I want some one to amuse Fleur; she's restive."</p>

<p>"R-restive?" repeated Annette. "Is it the first time you see
that, my friend? She was born r-restive, as you call it."</p>

<p>Would she never get that affected roll out of her r's?</p>

<p>He touched the dress she had taken off, and asked:</p>

<p>"What have you been doing?"</p>

<p>Annette looked at him, reflected in her glass. Her
just-brightened lips smiled, rather full, rather ironical.</p>

<p>"Enjoying myself," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh!" answered Soames glumly. "Ribbandry, I suppose."</p>

<p>It was his word for all that incomprehensible running in and out
of shops that women went in for. "Has Fleur got her summer
dresses?"</p>

<p>"You don't ask if I have mine."</p>

<p>"You don't care whether I do or not."</p>

<p>"Quite right. Well, she has; and I have mine&mdash;terribly
expensive."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Soames. "What does that chap Profond do in
England?"</p>

<p>Annette raised the eyebrows she had just finished.</p>

<p>"He yachts."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Soames; "he's a sleepy chap."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," answered Annette, and her face had a sort of quiet
enjoyment. "But sometimes very amusing."</p>

<p>"He's got a touch of the tar-brush about him."</p>

<p>Annette stretched herself.</p>

<p>"Tar-brush?" she said. "What is that? His mother was
Armenienne."</p>

<p>"That's it, then," muttered Soames. "Does he know anything about
pictures?"</p>

<p>"He knows about everything&mdash;a man of the world."</p>

<p>"Well, get some one for Fleur. I want to distract her. She's
going off on Saturday to Val Dartie and his wife; I don't like
it."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>Since the reason could not be explained without going into
family history, Soames merely answered:</p>

<p>"Racketing about. There's too much of it."</p>

<p>"I like that little Mrs. Val; she is very quiet and clever."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of her except&mdash;This thing's new." And
Soames took up a creation from the bed.</p>

<p>Annette received it from him.</p>

<p>"Would you hook me?" she said.</p>

<p>Soames hooked. Glancing once over her shoulder into the glass,
he saw the expression on her face, faintly amused, faintly
contemptuous, as much as to say: "Thanks! You will never learn!"
No, thank God, he wasn't a Frenchman! He finished with a jerk, and
the words: "It's too low here." And he went to the door, with the
wish to get away from her and go down to Fleur again.</p>

<p>Annette stayed a powder-puff, and said with startling
suddenness</p>

<p>"Que to es grossier!"</p>

<p>He knew the expression&mdash;he had reason to. The first time
she had used it he had thought it meant "What a grocer you are!"
and had not known whether to be relieved or not when better
informed. He resented the word&mdash;he was not coarse! If he was
coarse, what was that chap in the room beyond his, who made those
horrible noises in the morning when he cleared his throat, or those
people in the Lounge who thought it well-bred to say nothing but
what the whole world could hear at the top of their
voices&mdash;quacking inanity! Coarse, because he had said her
dress was low! Well, so it was! He went out without reply.</p>

<p>Coming into the Lounge from the far end, he at once saw Fleur
where he had left her. She sat with crossed knees, slowly balancing
a foot in silk stocking and grey shoe, sure sign that she was
dreaming. Her eyes showed it too&mdash;they went off like that
sometimes. And then, in a moment, she would come to life, and be as
quick and restless as a monkey. And she knew so much, so
self-assured, and not yet nineteen. What was that odious word?
Flapper! Dreadful young creatures&mdash;squealing and squawking and
showing their legs! The worst of them bad dreams, the best of them
powdered angels! Fleur was not a flapper, not one of those slangy,
ill-bred young females. And yet she was frighteningly self-willed,
and full of life, and determined to enjoy it. Enjoy! The word
brought no puritan terror to Soames; but it brought the terror
suited to his temperament. He had always been afraid to enjoy
to-day for fear he might not enjoy tomorrow so much. And it was
terrifying to feel that his daughter was divested of that
safeguard. The very way she sat in that chair showed it&mdash;lost
in her dream. He had never been lost in a dream himself&mdash;there
was nothing to be had out of it; and where she got it from he did
not know! Certainly not from Annette! And yet Annette, as a young
girl, when he was hanging about her, had once had a flowery look.
Well, she had lost it now!</p>

<p>Fleur rose from her chair-swiftly, restlessly; and flung herself
down at a writing-table. Seizing ink and writing paper, she began
to write as if she had not time to breathe before she got her
letter written. And suddenly she saw him. The air of desperate
absorption vanished, she smiled, waved a kiss, made a pretty face
as if she were a little puzzled and a little bored.</p>

<p>Ah! She was "fine"&mdash;"fine!"</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.&mdash;AT ROBIN HILL</h3>

<p>Jolyon Forsyte had spent his boy's nineteenth birthday at Robin
Hill, quietly going into his affairs. He did everything quietly
now, because his heart was in a poor way, and, like all his family,
he disliked the idea of dying. He had never realised how much till
one day, two years ago, he had gone to his doctor about certain
symptoms, and been told:</p>

<p>"At any moment, on any overstrain."</p>

<p>He had taken it with a smile&mdash;the natural Forsyte reaction
against an unpleasant truth. But with an increase of symptoms in
the train on the way home, he had realised to the full the sentence
hanging over him. To leave Irene, his boy, his home, his
work&mdash;though he did little enough work now! To leave them for
unknown darkness, for the unimaginable state, for such nothingness
that he would not even be conscious of wind stirring leaves above
his grave, nor of the scent of earth and grass. Of such nothingness
that, however hard he might try to conceive it, he never could, and
must still hover on the hope that he might see again those he
loved! To realise this was to endure very poignant spiritual
anguish. Before he reached home that day he had determined to keep
it from Irene. He would have to be more careful than man had ever
been, for the least thing would give it away and make her as
wretched as himself, almost. His doctor had passed him sound in
other respects, and seventy was nothing of an age&mdash;he would
last a long time yet, if he could.</p>

<p>Such a conclusion, followed out for nearly two years, develops
to the full the subtler side of character. Naturally not abrupt,
except when nervously excited, Jolyon had become control incarnate.
The sad patience of old people who cannot exert themselves was
masked by a smile which his lips preserved even in private. He
devised continually all manner of cover to conceal his enforced
lack of exertion.</p>

<p>Mocking himself for so doing, he counterfeited conversion to the
Simple Life; gave up wine and cigars, drank a special kind of
coffee with no coffee in it. In short, he made himself as safe as a
Forsyte in his condition could, under the rose of his mild irony.
Secure from discovery, since his wife and son had gone up to Town,
he had spent the fine May day quietly arranging his papers, that he
might die to-morrow without inconveniencing any one, giving in fact
a final polish to his terrestrial state. Having docketed and
enclosed it in his father's old Chinese cabinet, he put the key
into an envelope, wrote the words outside: "Key of the Chinese
cabinet, wherein will be found the exact state of me, J. F.," and
put it in his breast-pocket, where it would be always about him, in
case of accident. Then, ringing for tea, he went out to have it
under the old oak-tree.</p>

<p>All are under sentence of death; Jolyon, whose sentence was but
a little more precise and pressing, had become so used to it that
he thought habitually, like other people, of other things. He
thought of his son now.</p>

<p>Jon was nineteen that day, and Jon had come of late to a
decision. Educated neither at Eton like his father, nor at Harrow,
like his dead half-brother, but at one of those establishments
which, designed to avoid the evil and contain the good of the
Public School system, may or may not contain the evil and avoid the
good, Jon had left in April perfectly ignorant of whit he wanted to
become. The War, which had promised to go on for ever, had ended
just as he was about to join the Army, six months before his time.
It had taken him ever since to get used to the idea that he could
now choose for himself. He had held with his father several
discussions, from which, under a cheery show of being ready for
anything&mdash;except, of course, the Church, Army, Law, Stage,
Stock Exchange, Medicine, Business, and Engineering&mdash;Jolyon
had gathered rather clearly that Jon wanted to go in for nothing.
He himself had felt exactly like that at the same age. With him
that pleasant vacuity had soon been ended by an early marriage, and
its unhappy consequences. Forced to become an underwriter at
Lloyd's, he had regained prosperity before his artistic talent had
outcropped. But having&mdash;as the simple say&mdash;"learned" his
boy to draw pigs and other animals, he knew that Jon would never be
a painter, and inclined to the conclusion that his aversion from
everything else meant that he was going to be a writer. Holding,
however, the view that experience was necessary even for that
profession, there seemed to Jolyon nothing in the meantime, for
Jon, but University, travel, and perhaps the eating of dinners for
the Bar. After that one would see, or more probably one would not.
In face of these proffered allurements, however, Jon had remained
undecided.</p>

<p>Such discussions with his son had confirmed in Jolyon a doubt
whether the world had really changed. People said that it was a new
age. With the profundity of one not too long for any age, Jolyon
perceived that under slightly different surfaces the era was
precisely what it had been. Mankind was still divided into two
species: The few who had "speculation" in their souls, and the many
who had none, with a belt of hybrids like himself in the middle.
Jon appeared to have speculation; it seemed to his father a bad
lookout.</p>

<p>With something deeper, therefore, than his usual smile, he had
heard the boy say, a fortnight ago: "I should like to try farming,
Dad; if it won't cost you too much. It seems to be about the only
sort of life that doesn't hurt anybody; except art, and of course
that's out of the question for me."</p>

<p>Jolyon subdued his smile, and answered:</p>

<p>"All right; you shall skip back to where we were under the first
Jolyon in 1760. It'll prove the cycle theory, and incidentally, no
doubt, you may grow a better turnip than he did."</p>

<p>A little dashed, Jon had answered:</p>

<p>"But don't you think it's a good scheme, Dad?"</p>

<p>"'Twill serve, my dear; and if you should really take to it,
you'll do more good than most men, which is little enough."</p>

<p>To himself, however, he had said: 'But he won't take to it. I
give him four years. Still, it's healthy, and harmless.'</p>

<p>After turning the matter over and consulting with Irene, he
wrote to his daughter, Mrs. Val Dartie, asking if they knew of a
farmer near them on the Downs who would take Jon as an apprentice.
Holly's answer had been enthusiastic. There was an excellent man
quite close; she and Val would love Jon to live with them.</p>

<p>The boy was due to go to-morrow.</p>

<p>Sipping weak tea with lemon in it, Jolyon gazed through the
leaves of the old oak-tree at that view which had appeared to him
desirable for thirty-two years. The tree beneath which he sat
seemed not a day older! So young, the little leaves of brownish
gold; so old, the whitey-grey-green of its thick rough trunk. A
tree of memories, which would live on hundreds of years yet, unless
some barbarian cut it down&mdash;would see old England out at the
pace things were going! He remembered a night three years before,
when, looking from his window, with his arm close round Irene, he
had watched a German aeroplane hovering, it seemed, right over the
old tree. Next day they had found a bomb hole in a field on Gage's
farm. That was before he knew that he was under sentence of death.
He could almost have wished the bomb had finished him. It would
have saved a lot of hanging about, many hours of cold fear in the
pit of his stomach. He had counted on living to the normal Forsyte
age of eighty-five or more, when Irene would be seventy. As it was,
she would miss him. Still there was Jon, more important in her life
than himself; Jon, who adored his mother.</p>

<p>Under that tree, where old Jolyon&mdash;waiting for Irene to
come to him across the lawn&mdash;had breathed his last, Jolyon
wondered, whimsically, whether, having put everything in such
perfect order, he had not better close his own eyes and drift away.
There was something undignified in o parasitically clinging on to
the effortless close of a life wherein he regretted two things
only&mdash;the long division between his father and himself when he
was young, and the lateness of his union o with Irene.</p>

<p>From where he sat he could see a cluster of apple-trees in
blossom. Nothing in Nature moved him so much as fruit-trees in
blossom; and his heart ached suddenly because he might never see
them flower again. Spring! Decidedly no man ought to have to die
while his heart was still young enough to love beauty! Blackbirds
sang recklessly in the shrubbery, swallows were flying high, the
leaves above him glistened; and over the fields was every
imaginable tint of early foliage, burnished by the level sunlight,
away to where the distant "smoke-bush" blue was trailed along the
horizon. Irene's flowers in their narrow beds had startling
individuality that evening, little deep assertions of gay life.
Only Chinese and Japanese painters, and perhaps Leonardo, had known
how to get that startling little ego into each painted flower, and
bird, and beast&mdash;the ego, yet the sense of species, the
universality of life as well. They were the fellows! 'I've made
nothing that will live!' thought Jolyon; 'I've been an
amateur&mdash;a mere lover, not a creator. Still, I shall leave Jon
behind me when I go.' What luck that the boy had not been caught by
that ghastly war! He might so easily have been killed, like poor
Jolly twenty years ago out in the Transvaal. Jon would do something
some day&mdash;if the Age didn't spoil him&mdash;an imaginative
chap! His whim to take up farming was but a bit of sentiment, and
about as likely to last. And just then he saw them coming up the
field: Irene and the boy; walking from the station, with their arms
linked. And getting up, he strolled down through the new rose
garden to meet them...</p>

<p>Irene came into his room that night and sat down by the window.
She sat there without speaking till he said:</p>

<p>"What is it, my love?"</p>

<p>"We had an encounter to-day."</p>

<p>"With whom?"</p>

<p>"Soames."</p>

<p>Soames! He had kept that name out of his thoughts these last two
years; conscious that it was bad for him. And, now, his heart moved
in a disconcerting manner, as if it had side-slipped within his
chest.</p>

<p>Irene went on quietly:</p>

<p>"He and his daughter were in the Gallery, and afterward at the
confectioner's where we had tea."</p>

<p>Jolyon went over and put his hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"How did he look?"</p>

<p>"Grey; but otherwise much the same."</p>

<p>"And the daughter?"</p>

<p>"Pretty. At least, Jon thought so."</p>

<p>Jolyon's heart side-slipped again. His wife's face had a
strained and puzzled look.</p>

<p>"You didn't-?" he began.</p>

<p>"No; but Jon knows their name. The girl dropped her handkerchief
and he picked it up."</p>

<p>Jolyon sat down on his bed. An evil chance!</p>

<p>"June was with you. Did she put her foot into it?"</p>

<p>"No; but it was all very queer and strained, and Jon could see
it was."</p>

<p>Jolyon drew a long breath, and said:</p>

<p>"I've often wondered whether we've been right to keep it from
him. He'll find out some day."</p>

<p>"The later the better, Jolyon; the young have such cheap, hard
judgment. When you were nineteen what would you have thought of
your mother if she had done what I have?"</p>

<p>Yes! There it was! Jon worshipped his mother; and knew nothing
of the tragedies, the inexorable necessities of life, nothing of
the prisoned grief in an unhappy marriage, nothing of jealousy or
passion&mdash;knew nothing at all, as yet!</p>

<p>"What have you told him?" he said at last.</p>

<p>"That they were relations, but we didn't know them; that you had
never cared much for your family, or they for you. I expect he will
be asking you."</p>

<p>Jolyon smiled. "This promises to take the place of air-raids,"
he said. "After all, one misses them."</p>

<p>Irene looked up at him.</p>

<p>"We've known it would come some day."</p>

<p>He answered her with sudden energy:</p>

<p>"I could never stand seeing Jon blame you. He shan't do that,
even in thought. He has imagination; and he'll understand if it's
put to him properly. I think I had better tell him before he gets
to know otherwise."</p>

<p>"Not yet, Jolyon."</p>

<p>That was like her&mdash;she had no foresight, and never went to
meet trouble. Still&mdash;who knew?&mdash;she might be right. It
was ill going against a mother's instinct. It might be well to let
the boy go on, if possible, till experience had given him some
touchstone by which he could judge the values of that old tragedy;
till love, jealousy, longing, had deepened his charity. All the
same, one must take precautions&mdash;every precaution possible!
And, long after Irene had left him, he lay awake turning over those
precautions. He must write to Holly, telling her that Jon knew
nothing as yet of family history. Holly was discreet, she would
make sure of her husband, she would see to it! Jon could take the
letter with him when he went to-morrow.</p>

<p>And so the day on which he had put the polish on his material
estate died out with the chiming of the stable clock; and another
began for Jolyon in the shadow of a spiritual disorder which could
not be so rounded off and polished...</p>

<p>But Jon, whose room had once been his day nursery, lay awake
too, the prey of a sensation disputed by those who have never known
it, "love at first sight!" He had felt it beginning in him with the
glint of those dark eyes gazing into his athwart the Juno&mdash;a
conviction that this was his 'dream'; so that what followed had
seemed to him at once natural and miraculous. Fleur! Her name alone
was almost enough for one who was terribly susceptible to the charm
of words. In a homoeopathic Age, when boys and girls were
co-educated, and mixed up in early life till sex was almost
abolished, Jon was singularly old-fashioned. His modern school took
boys only, and his holidays had been spent at Robin Hill with boy
friends, or his parents alone. He had never, therefore, been
inoculated against the germs of love by small doses of the poison.
And now in the dark his temperature was mounting fast. He lay
awake, featuring Fleur&mdash;as they called it&mdash;recalling her
words, especially that "Au revoir!" so soft and sprightly.</p>

<p>He was still so wide awake at dawn that he got up, slipped on
tennis shoes, trousers, and a sweater, and in silence crept
downstairs and out through the study window. It was just light;
there was a smell of grass. 'Fleur!' he thought; 'Fleur!' It was
mysteriously white out of doors, with nothing awake except the
birds just beginning to chirp. 'I'll go down into the coppice,' he
thought. He ran down through the fields, reached the pond just as
the sun rose, and passed into the coppice. Bluebells carpeted the
ground there; among the larch-trees there was mystery&mdash;the
air, as it were, composed of that romantic quality. Jon sniffed its
freshness, and stared at the bluebells in the sharpening light.
Fleur! It rhymed with her! And she lived at Mapleduram&mdash;a
jolly name, too, on the river somewhere. He could find it in the
atlas presently. He would write to her. But would she answer? Oh!
She must. She had said "Au revoir!" Not good-bye! What luck that
she had dropped her handkerchief! He would never have known her but
for that. And the more he thought of that handkerchief, the more
amazing his luck seemed. Fleur! It certainly rhymed with her!
Rhythm thronged his head; words jostled to be joined together; he
was on the verge of a poem.</p>

<p>Jon remained in this condition for more than half an hour, then
returned to the house, and getting a ladder, climbed in at his
bedroom window out of sheer exhilaration. Then, remembering that
the study window was open, he went down and shut it, first removing
the ladder, so as to obliterate all traces of his feeling. The
thing was too deep to be revealed to mortal soul-even-to his
mother.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.&mdash;THE MAUSOLEUM</h3>

<p>There are houses whose souls have passed into the limbo of Time,
leaving their bodies in the limbo of London. Such was not quite the
condition of "Timothy's" on the Bayswater Road, for Timothy's soul
still had one foot in Timothy Forsyte's body, and Smither kept the
atmosphere unchanging, of camphor and port wine and house whose
windows are only opened to air it twice a day.</p>

<p>To Forsyte imagination that house was now a sort of Chinese
pill-box, a series of layers in the last of which was Timothy. One
did not reach him, or so it was reported by members of the family
who, out of old-time habit or absentmindedness, would drive up once
in a blue moon and ask after their surviving uncle. Such were
Francie, now quite emancipated from God (she frankly avowed
atheism), Euphemia, emancipated from old Nicholas, and Winifred
Dartie from her "man of the world." But, after all, everybody was
emancipated now, or said they were&mdash;perhaps not quite the same
thing!</p>

<p>When Soames, therefore, took it on his way to Paddington station
on the morning after that encounter, it was hardly with the
expectation of seeing Timothy in the flesh. His heart made a faint
demonstration within him while he stood in full south sunlight on
the newly whitened doorstep of that little house where four
Forsytes had once lived, and now but one dwelt on like a winter
fly; the house into which Soames had come and out of which he had
gone times without number, divested of, or burdened with, fardels
of family gossip; the house of the "old people" of another century,
another age.</p>

<p>The sight of Smither&mdash;still corseted up to the armpits
because the new fashion which came in as they were going out about
1903 had never been considered "nice" by Aunts Juley and
Hester&mdash;brought a pale friendliness to Soames' lips; Smither,
still faithfully arranged to old pattern in every detail, an
invaluable servant&mdash;none such left&mdash;smiling back at him,
with the words: "Why! it's Mr. Soames, after all this time! And how
are you, sir? Mr. Timothy will be so pleased to know you've
been."</p>

<p>"How is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh! he keeps fairly bobbish for his age, sir; but of course
he's a wonderful man. As I said to Mrs. Dartie when she was here
last: It would please Miss Forsyte and Mrs. Juley and Miss Hester
to see how he relishes a baked apple still. But he's quite deaf.
And a mercy, I always think. For what we should have done with him
in the air-raids, I don't know."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Soames. "What did you do with him?"</p>

<p>"We just left him in his bed, and had the bell run down into the
cellar, so that Cook and I could hear him if he rang. It would
never have done to let him know there was a war on. As I said to
Cook, 'If Mr. Timothy rings, they may do what they like&mdash;I'm
going up. My dear mistresses would have a fit if they could see him
ringing and nobody going to him.' But he slept through them all
beautiful. And the one in the daytime he was having his bath. It
was a mercy, because he might have noticed the people in the street
all looking up&mdash;he often looks out of the window."</p>

<p>"Quite!" murmured Soames. Smither was getting garrulous! "I just
want to look round and see if there's anything to be done."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I don't think there's anything except a smell of mice
in the dining-room that we don't know how to get rid of. It's funny
they should be there, and not a crumb, since Mr. Timothy took to
not coming down, just before the War. But they're nasty little
things; you never know where they'll take you next."</p>

<p>"Does he leave his bed?"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, sir; he takes nice exercise between his bed and the
window in the morning, not to risk a change of air. And he's quite
comfortable in himself; has his Will out every day regular. It's a
great consolation to him&mdash;that."</p>

<p>"Well, Smither, I want to see him, if I can; in case he has
anything to say to me."</p>

<p>Smither coloured up above her corsets.</p>

<p>"It will be an occasion!" she said. "Shall I take you round the
house, sir, while I send Cook to break it to him?"</p>

<p>"No, you go to him," said Soames. "I can go round the house by
myself."</p>

<p>One could not confess to sentiment before another, and Soames
felt that he was going to be sentimental nosing round those rooms
so saturated with the past. When Smither, creaking with excitement,
had left him, Soames entered the dining-room and sniffed. In his
opinion it wasn't mice, but incipient wood-rot, and he examined the
panelling. Whether it was worth a coat of paint, at Timothy's age,
he was not sure. The room had always been the most modern in the
house; and only a faint smile curled Soames' lips and nostrils.
Walls of a rich green surmounted the oak dado; a heavy metal
chandelier hung by a chain from a ceiling divided by imitation
beams. The pictures had been bought by Timothy, a bargain, one day
at Jobson's sixty years ago&mdash;three Snyder "still lifes," two
faintly coloured drawings of a boy and a girl, rather charming,
which bore the initials "J. R."&mdash;Timothy had always believed
they might turn out to be Joshua Reynolds, but Soames, who admired
them, had discovered that they were only John Robinson; and a
doubtful Morland of a white pony being shod. Deep-red plush
curtains, ten high-backed dark mahogany chairs with deep-red plush
seats, a Turkey carpet, and a mahogany dining-table as large as the
room was small, such was an apartment which Soames could remember
unchanged in soul or body since he was four years old. He looked
especially at the two drawings, and thought: 'I shall buy those at
the sale.'</p>

<p>From the dining-room he passed into Timothy's study. He did not
remember ever having been in that room. It was lined from floor to
ceiling with volumes, and he looked at them with curiosity. One
wall seemed devoted to educational books, which Timothy's firm had
published two generations back-sometimes as many as twenty copies
of one book. Soames read their titles and shuddered. The middle
wall had precisely the same books as used to be in the library at
his own father's in Park Lane, from which he deduced the fancy that
James and his youngest brother had gone out together one day and
bought a brace of small libraries. The third wall he approached
with more excitement. Here, surely, Timothy's own taste would be
found. It was. The books were dummies. The fourth wall was all
heavily curtained window. And turned toward it was a large chair
with a mahogany reading-stand attached, on which a yellowish and
folded copy of The Times, dated July 6, 1914, the day Timothy first
failed to come down, as if in preparation for the War, seemed
waiting for him still. In a corner stood a large globe of that
world never visited by Timothy, deeply convinced of the unreality
of everything but England, and permanently upset by the sea, on
which he had been very sick one Sunday afternoon in 1836, out of a
pleasure boat off the pier at Brighton, with Juley and Hester,
Swithin and Hatty Chessman; all due to Swithin, who was always
taking things into his head, and who, thank goodness, had been sick
too. Soames knew all about it, having heard the tale fifty times at
least from one or other of them. He went up to the globe, and gave
it a spin; it emitted a faint creak and moved about an inch,
bringing into his purview a daddy-long-legs which had died on it in
latitude 44.</p>

<p>'Mausoleum!' he thought. 'George was right!' And he went out and
up the stairs. On the half-landing he stopped before the case of
stuffed humming-birds which had delighted his childhood. They
looked not a day older, suspended on wires above pampas-grass. If
the case were opened the birds would not begin to hum, but the
whole thing would crumble, he suspected. It wouldn't be worth
putting that into the sale! And suddenly he was caught by a memory
of Aunt Ann&mdash;dear old Aunt Ann&mdash;holding him by the hand
in front of that case and saying: "Look, Soamey! Aren't they bright
and pretty, dear little humming-birds!" Soames remembered his own
answer: "They don't hum, Auntie." He must have been six, in a black
velveteen suit with a light-blue collar-he remembered that suit
well! Aunt Ann with her ringlets, and her spidery kind hands, and
her grave old aquiline smile&mdash;a fine old lady, Aunt Ann! He
moved on up to the drawing-room door. There on each side of it were
the groups of miniatures. Those he would certainly buy in! The
miniatures of his four aunts, one of his Uncle Swithin adolescent,
and one of his Uncle Nicholas as a boy. They had all been painted
by a young lady friend of the family at a time, 1830, about, when
miniatures were considered very genteel, and lasting too, painted
as they were on ivory. Many a time had he heard the tale of that
young lady: "Very talented, my dear; she had quite a weakness for
Swithin, and very soon after she went into a consumption and died:
so like Keats&mdash;we often spoke of it."</p>

<p>Well, there they were! Ann, Juley, Hester, Susan&mdash;quite a
small child; Swithin, with sky-blue eyes, pink cheeks, yellow
curls, white waistcoat-large as life; and Nicholas, like Cupid with
an eye on heaven. Now he came to think of it, Uncle Nick had always
been rather like that&mdash;a wonderful man to the last. Yes, she
must have had talent, and miniatures always had a certain
back-watered cachet of their own, little subject to the currents of
competition on aesthetic Change. Soames opened the drawing-room
door. The room was dusted, the furniture uncovered, the curtains
drawn back, precisely as if his aunts still dwelt there patiently
waiting. And a thought came to him: When Timothy died&mdash;why
not? Would it not be almost a duty to preserve this
house&mdash;like Carlyle's&mdash;and put up a tablet, and show it?
"Specimen of mid-Victorian abode&mdash;entrance, one shilling, with
catalogue." After all, it was the completest thing, and perhaps the
deadest in the London of to-day. Perfect in its special taste and
culture, if, that is, he took down and carried over to his own
collection the four Barbizon pictures he had given them. The still
sky-blue walls, tile green curtains patterned with red flowers and
ferns; the crewel-worked fire-screen before the cast-iron grate;
the mahogany cupboard with glass windows, full of little
knickknacks; the beaded footstools; Keats, Shelley, Southey,
Cowper, Coleridge, Byron's Corsair (but nothing else), and the
Victorian poets in a bookshelf row; the marqueterie cabinet lined
with dim red plush, full of family relics: Hester's first fan; the
buckles of their mother's father's shoes; three bottled scorpions;
and one very yellow elephant's tusk, sent home from India by
Great-uncle Edgar Forsyte, who had been in jute; a yellow bit of
paper propped up, with spidery writing on it, recording God knew
what! And the pictures crowding on the walls&mdash;all
water-colours save those four Barbizons looking like the foreigners
they were, and doubtful customers at that&mdash;pictures bright and
illustrative, "Telling the Bees," "Hey for the Ferry!" and two in
the style of Frith, all thimblerig and crinolines, given them by
Swithin. Oh! many, many pictures at which Soames had gazed a
thousand times in supercilious fascination; a marvellous collection
of bright, smooth gilt frames.</p>

<p>And the boudoir-grand piano, beautifully dusted, hermetically
sealed as ever; and Aunt Juley's album of pressed seaweed on it.
And the gilt-legged chairs, stronger than they looked. And on one
side of the fireplace the sofa of crimson silk, where Aunt Ann, and
after her Aunt Juley, had been wont to sit, facing the light and
bolt upright. And on the other side of the fire the one really easy
chair, back to the light, for Aunt Hester. Soames screwed up his
eyes; he seemed to see them sitting there. Ah! and the
atmosphere&mdash;even now, of too many stuffs and washed lace
curtains, lavender in bags, and dried bees' wings. 'No,' he
thought, 'there's nothing like it left; it ought to be preserved.'
And, by George, they might laugh at it, but for a standard of
gentle life never departed from, for fastidiousness of skin and eye
and nose and feeling, it beat to-day hollow&mdash;to-day with its
Tubes and cars, its perpetual smoking, its cross-legged,
bare-necked girls visible up to the knees and down to the waist if
you took the trouble (agreeable to the satyr within each Forsyte
but hardly his idea of a lady), with their feet, too, screwed round
the legs of their chairs while they ate, and their "So longs," and
their "Old Beans," and their laughter&mdash;girls who gave him the
shudders whenever he thought of Fleur in contact with them; and the
hard-eyed, capable, older women who managed life and gave him the
shudders too. No! his old aunts, if they never opened their minds,
their eyes, or very much their windows, at least had manners, and a
standard, and reverence for past and future.</p>

<p>With rather a choky feeling he closed the door and went
tiptoeing upstairs. He looked in at a place on the way: H'm! in
perfect order of the eighties, with a sort of yellow oilskin paper
on the walls. At the top of the stairs he hesitated between four
doors. Which of them was Timothy's? And he listened. A sound, as of
a child slowly dragging a hobby-horse about, came to his ears. That
must be Timothy! He tapped, and a door was opened by Smither, very
red in the face.</p>

<p>Mr. Timothy was taking his walk, and she had not been able to
get him to attend. If Mr. Soames would come into the back-room, he
could see him through the door.</p>

<p>Soames went into the back-room and stood watching.</p>

<p>The last of the old Forsytes was on his feet, moving with the
most impressive slowness, and an air of perfect concentration on
his own affairs, backward and forward between the foot of his bed
and the window, a distance of some twelve feet. The lower part of
his square face, no longer clean-shaven, was covered with snowy
beard clipped as short as it could be, and his chin looked as broad
as his brow where the hair was also quite white, while nose and
cheeks and brow were a good yellow. One hand held a stout stick,
and the other grasped the skirt of his Jaeger dressing-gown, from
under which could be seen his bed-socked ankles and feet thrust
into Jaeger slippers. The expression on his face was that of a
crossed child, intent on something that he has not got. Each time
he turned he stumped the stick, and then dragged it, as if to show
that he could do without it:</p>

<p>"He still looks strong," said Soames under his breath.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, sir. You should see him take his bath&mdash;it's
wonderful; he does enjoy it so."</p>

<p>Those quite loud words gave Soames an insight. Timothy had
resumed his babyhood.</p>

<p>"Does he take any interest in things generally?" he said, also
loud.</p>

<p>"Oh I yes, sir; his food and his Will. It's quite a sight to see
him turn it over and over, not to read it, of course; and every now
and then he asks the price of Consols, and I write it on a slate
for him&mdash;very large. Of course, I always write the same, what
they were when he last took notice, in 1914. We got the doctor to
forbid him to read the paper when the War broke out. Oh! he did
take on about that at first. But he soon came round, because he
knew it tired him; and he's a wonder to conserve energy as he used
to call it when my dear mistresses were alive, bless their hearts!
How he did go on at them about that; they were always so active, if
you remember, Mr. Soames."</p>

<p>"What would happen if I were to go in?" asked Soames: "Would he
remember me? I made his Will, you know, after Miss Hester died in
1907."</p>

<p>"Oh! that, sir," replied Smither doubtfully, "I couldn't take on
me to say. I think he might; he really is a wonderful man for his
age."</p>

<p>Soames moved into the doorway, and waiting for Timothy to turn,
said in a loud voice: "Uncle Timothy!"</p>

<p>Timothy trailed back half-way, and halted.</p>

<p>"Eh?" he said.</p>

<p>"Soames," cried Soames at the top of his voice, holding out his
hand, "Soames Forsyte!"</p>

<p>"No!" said Timothy, and stumping his stick loudly on the floor,
he continued his walk.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem to work," said Soames.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Smither, rather crestfallen; "you see, he
hasn't finished his walk. It always was one thing at a time with
him. I expect he'll ask me this afternoon if you came about the
gas, and a pretty job I shall have to make him understand."</p>

<p>"Do you think he ought to have a man about him?"</p>

<p>Smither held up her hands. "A man! Oh! no. Cook and me can
manage perfectly. A strange man about would send him crazy in no
time. And my mistresses wouldn't like the idea of a man in the
house. Besides, we're so&mdash;proud of him."</p>

<p>"I suppose the doctor comes?"</p>

<p>"Every morning. He makes special terms for such a quantity, and
Mr. Timothy's so used, he doesn't take a bit of notice, except to
put out his tongue."</p>

<p>"Well," said Soames, turning away, "it's rather sad and painful
to me."</p>

<p>"Oh! sir," returned Smither anxiously, "you mustn't think that.
Now that he can't worry about things, he quite enjoys his life,
really he does. As I say to Cook, Mr. Timothy is more of a man than
he ever was. You see, when he's not walkin', or takin' his bath,
he's eatin', and when he's not eatin', he's sleepin'; and there it
is. There isn't an ache or a care about him anywhere."</p>

<p>"Well," said Soames, "there's something in that. I'll go down.
By the way, let me see his Will."</p>

<p>"I should have to take my time about that, sir; he keeps it
under his pillow, and he'd see me, while he's active."</p>

<p>"I only want to know if it's the one I made," said Soames; "you
take a look at its date some time, and let me know."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but I'm sure it's the same, because me and Cook
witnessed, you remember, and there's our names on it still, and
we've only done it once."</p>

<p>"Quite," said Soames. He did remember. Smither and Jane had been
proper witnesses, having been left nothing in the Will that they
might have no interest in Timothy's death. It had been&mdash;he
fully admitted&mdash;an almost improper precaution, but Timothy had
wished it, and, after all, Aunt Hester had provided for them
amply.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said; "good-bye, Smither. Look after him, and if
he should say anything at any time, put it down, and let me
know."</p>

<p>"Oh I yes, Mr. Soames; I'll be sure to do that. It's been such a
pleasant change to see you. Cook will be quite excited when I tell
her."</p>

<p>Soames shook her hand and went down-stairs. He stood for fully
two minutes by the hat-stand whereon he had hung his hat so many
times. 'So it all passes,' he was thinking; 'passes and begins
again. Poor old chap!' And he listened, if perchance the sound of
Timothy trailing his hobby-horse might come down the well of the
stairs; or some ghost of an old face show over the bannisters, and
an old voice say: 'Why, it's dear Soames, and we were only saying
that we hadn't seen him for a week!'</p>

<p>Nothing&mdash;nothing! Just the scent of camphor, and dust-motes
in a sunbeam through the fanlight over the door. The little old
house! A mausoleum! And, turning on his heel, he went out, and
caught his train.</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.&mdash;THE NATIVE HEATH</h3>

<blockquote>"His foot's upon his native heath,<br>
His name's&mdash;Val Dartie."</blockquote>

<p>With some such feeling did Val Dartie, in the fortieth year of
his age, set out that same Thursday morning very early from the old
manor-house he had taken on the north side of the Sussex Downs. His
destination was Newmarket, and he had not been there since the
autumn of 1899, when he stole over from Oxford for the
Cambridgeshire. He paused at the door to give his wife a kiss, and
put a flask of port into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Don't overtire your leg, Val, and don't bet too much."</p>

<p>With the pressure of her chest against his own, and her eyes
looking into his, Val felt both leg and pocket safe. He should be
moderate; Holly was always right&mdash;she had a natural aptitude.
It did not seem so remarkable to him, perhaps, as it might to
others, that&mdash;half Dartie as he was&mdash;he should have been
perfectly faithful to his young first cousin during the twenty
years since he married her romantically out in the Boer War; and
faithful without any feeling of sacrifice or boredom&mdash;she was
so quick, so slyly always a little in front of his mood. Being
first cousins they had decided, rather needlessly, to have no
children; and, though a little sallower, she had kept her looks,
her slimness, and the colour of her dark hair. Val particularly
admired the life of her own she carried on, besides carrying on
his, and riding better every year. She kept up her music, she read
an awful lot&mdash;novels, poetry, all sorts of stuff. Out on their
farm in Cape colony she had looked after all the "nigger" babies
and women in a miraculous manner. She was, in fact, clever; yet
made no fuss about it, and had no "side." Though not remarkable for
humility, Val had come to have the feeling that she was his
superior, and he did not grudge it&mdash;a great tribute. It might
be noted that he never looked at Holly without her knowing of it,
but that she looked at him sometimes unawares.</p>

<p>He had kissed her in the porch because he should not be doing so
on the platform, though she was going to the station with him, to
drive the car back. Tanned and wrinkled by Colonial weather and the
wiles inseparable from horses, and handicapped by the leg which,
weakened in the Boer War, had probably saved his life in the War
just past, Val was still much as he had been in the days of his
courtship; his smile as wide and charming, his eyelashes, if
anything, thicker and darker, his eyes screwed up under them, as
bright a grey, his freckles rather deeper, his hair a little
grizzled at the sides. He gave the impression of one who has lived
actively with horses in a sunny climate.</p>

<p>Twisting the car sharp round at the gate, he said:</p>

<p>"When is young Jon coming?"</p>

<p>"To-day."</p>

<p>"Is there anything you want for him? I could bring it down on
Saturday."</p>

<p>"No; but you might come by the same train as
Fleur&mdash;one-forty."</p>

<p>Val gave the Ford full rein; he still drove like a man in a new
country on bad roads, who refuses to compromise, and expects heaven
at every hole.</p>

<p>"That's a young woman who knows her way about," he said. "I say,
has it struck you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Holly.</p>

<p>"Uncle Soames and your Dad&mdash;bit awkward, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"She won't know, and he won't know, and nothing must be said, of
course. It's only for five days, Val."</p>

<p>"Stable secret! Righto!" If Holly thought it safe, it was.
Glancing slyly round at him, she said: "Did you notice how
beautifully she asked herself?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Well, she did. What do you think of her, Val?"</p>

<p>"Pretty and clever; but she might run out at any corner if she
got her monkey up, I should say."</p>

<p>"I'm wondering," Holly murmured, "whether she is the modern
young woman. One feels at sea coming home into all this."</p>

<p>"You? You get the hang of things so quick."</p>

<p>Holly slid her hand into his coat-pocket.</p>

<p>"You keep one in the know," said Val encouraged. "What do you
think of that Belgian fellow, Profond?"</p>

<p>"I think he's rather 'a good devil.'"</p>

<p>Val grinned.</p>

<p>"He seems to me a queer fish for a friend of our family. In
fact, our family is in pretty queer waters, with Uncle Soames
marrying a Frenchwoman, and your Dad marrying Soames's first. Our
grandfathers would have had fits!"</p>

<p>"So would anybody's, my dear."</p>

<p>"This car," Val said suddenly, "wants rousing; she doesn't get
her hind legs under her uphill. I shall have to give her her head
on the slope if I'm to catch that train."</p>

<p>There was that about horses which had prevented him from ever
really sympathising with a car, and the running of the Ford under
his guidance compared with its running under that of Holly was
always noticeable. He caught the train.</p>

<p>"Take care going home; she'll throw you down if she can.
Good-bye, darling."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," called Holly, and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>In the train, after quarter of an hour's indecision between
thoughts of Holly, his morning paper, the look of the bright day,
and his dim memory of Newmarket, Val plunged into the recesses of a
small square book, all names, pedigrees, tap-roots, and notes about
the make and shape of horses. The Forsyte in him was bent on the
acquisition of a certain strain of blood, and he was subduing
resolutely as yet the Dartie hankering for a Nutter. On getting
back to England, after the profitable sale of his South African
farm and stud, and observing that the sun seldom shone, Val had
said to himself: "I've absolutely got to have an interest in life,
or this country will give me the blues. Hunting's not enough, I'll
breed and I'll train." With just that extra pinch of shrewdness and
decision imparted by long residence in a new country, Val had seen
the weak point of modern breeding. They were all hypnotised by
fashion and high price. He should buy for looks, and let names go
hang! And here he was already, hypnotised by the prestige of a
certain strain of blood! Half-consciously, he thought: 'There's
something in this damned climate which makes one go round in a
ring. All the same, I must have a strain of Mayfly blood.'</p>

<p>In this mood he reached the Mecca of his hopes. It was one of
those quiet meetings favourable to such as wish to look into
horses, rather than into the mouths of bookmakers; and Val clung to
the paddock. His twenty years of Colonial life, divesting him of
the dandyism in which he had been bred, had left him the essential
neatness of the horseman, and given him a queer and rather
blighting eye over what he called "the silly haw-haw" of some
Englishmen, the "flapping cockatoory" of some
English-women&mdash;Holly had none of that and Holly was his model.
Observant, quick, resourceful, Val went straight to the heart of a
transaction, a horse, a drink; and he was on his way to the heart
of a Mayfly filly, when a slow voice said at his elbow:</p>

<p>"Mr. Val Dartie? How's Mrs. Val Dartie? She's well, I hope." And
he saw beside him the Belgian he had met at his sister
Imogen's.</p>

<p>"Prosper Profond&mdash;I met you at lunch," said the voice.</p>

<p>"How are you?" murmured Val.</p>

<p>"I'm very well," replied Monsieur Profond, smiling with a
certain inimitable slowness. "A good devil," Holly had called him.
Well! He looked a little like a devil, with his dark, clipped,
pointed beard; a sleepy one though, and good-humoured, with fine
eyes, unexpectedly intelligent.</p>

<p>"Here's a gentleman wants to know you&mdash;cousin of
yours&mdash;Mr. George Forsyde."</p>

<p>Val saw a large form, and a face clean-shaven, bull-like, a
little lowering, with sardonic humour bubbling behind a full grey
eye; he remembered it dimly from old days when he would dine with
his father at the Iseeum Club.</p>

<p>"I used to go racing with your father," George was saying:
"How's the stud? Like to buy one of my screws?"</p>

<p>Val grinned, to hide the sudden feeling that the bottom had
fallen out of breeding. They believed in nothing over here, not
even in horses. George Forsyte, Prosper Profond! The devil himself
was not more disillusioned than those two.</p>

<p>"Didn't know you were a racing man," he said to Monsieur
Profond.</p>

<p>"I'm not. I don't care for it. I'm a yachtin' man. I don't care
for yachtin' either, but I like to see my friends. I've got some
lunch, Mr. Val Dartie, just a small lunch, if you'd like to 'ave
some; not much&mdash;just a small one&mdash;in my car."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Val; "very good of you. I'll come along in about
quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>"Over there. Mr. Forsyde's comin'," and Monsieur Profond
"poinded" with a yellow-gloved finger; "small car, with a small
lunch"; he moved on, groomed, sleepy, and remote, George Forsyte
following, neat, huge, and with his jesting air.</p>

<p>Val remained gazing at the Mayfly filly. George Forsyte, of
course, was an old chap, but this Profond might be about his own
age; Val felt extremely young, as if the Mayfly filly were a toy at
which those two had laughed. The animal had lost reality.</p>

<p>"That 'small' mare"&mdash;he seemed to hear the voice of
Monsieur Profond&mdash;"what do you see in her?&mdash;we must all
die!"</p>

<p>And George Forsyte, crony of his father, racing still! The
Mayfly strain&mdash;was it any better than any other? He might just
as well have a flutter with his money instead.</p>

<p>"No, by gum!" he muttered suddenly, "if it's no good breeding
horses, it's no good doing anything. What did I come for? I'll buy
her."</p>

<p>He stood back and watched the ebb of the paddock visitors toward
the stand. Natty old chips, shrewd portly fellows, Jews, trainers
looking as if they had never been guilty of seeing a horse in their
lives; tall, flapping, languid women, or brisk, loud-voiced women;
young men with an air as if trying to take it seriously&mdash;two
or three of them with only one arm.</p>

<p>'Life over here's a game!' thought Val. 'Muffin bell rings,
horses run, money changes hands; ring again, run again, money
changes back.'</p>

<p>But, alarmed at his own philosophy, he went to the paddock gate
to watch the Mayfly filly canter down. She moved well; and he made
his way over to the "small" car. The "small" lunch was the sort a
man dreams of but seldom gets; and when it was concluded Monsieur
Profond walked back with him to the paddock.</p>

<p>"Your wife's a nice woman," was his surprising remark.</p>

<p>"Nicest woman I know," returned Val dryly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Monsieur Profond; "she has a nice face. I admire
nice women."</p>

<p>Val looked at him suspiciously, but something kindly and direct
in the heavy diabolism of his companion disarmed him for the
moment.</p>

<p>"Any time you like to come on my yacht, I'll give her a small
cruise."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Val, in arms again, "she hates the sea."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Monsieur Profond.</p>

<p>"Then why do you yacht?"</p>

<p>The Belgian's eyes smiled. "Oh! I don't know. I've done
everything; it's the last thing I'm doin'."</p>

<p>"It must be d&mdash;&mdash;d expensive. I should want more
reason than that."</p>

<p>Monsieur Prosper Profond raised his eyebrows, and puffed out a
heavy lower lip.</p>

<p>"I'm an easy-goin' man," he said.</p>

<p>"Were you in the War?" asked Val.</p>

<p>"Ye-es. I've done that too. I was gassed; it was a small bit
unpleasant." He smiled with a deep and sleepy air of prosperity, as
if he had caught it from his name.</p>

<p>Whether his saying "small" when he ought to have said "little"
was genuine mistake or affectation Val could not decide; the fellow
was evidently capable of anything.</p>

<p>Among the ring of buyers round the Mayfly filly who had won her
race, Monsieur Profond said:</p>

<p>"You goin' to bid?"</p>

<p>Val nodded. With this sleepy Satan at his elbow, he felt in need
of faith. Though placed above the ultimate blows of Providence by
the forethought of a grand-father who had tied him up a thousand a
year to which was added the thousand a year tied up for Holly by
her grand-father, Val was not flush of capital that he could touch,
having spent most of what he had realised from his South African
farm on his establishment in Sussex. And very soon he was thinking:
'Dash it! she's going beyond me!' His limit-six hundred-was
exceeded; he dropped out of the bidding. The Mayfly filly passed
under the hammer at seven hundred and fifty guineas. He was turning
away vexed when the slow voice of Monsieur Profond said in his
ear:</p>

<p>"Well, I've bought that small filly, but I don't want her; you
take her and give her to your wife."</p>

<p>Val looked at the fellow with renewed suspicion, but the good
humour in his eyes was such that he really could not take
offence.</p>

<p>"I made a small lot of money in the War," began Monsieur Profond
in answer to that look. "I 'ad armament shares. I like to give it
away. I'm always makin' money. I want very small lot myself. I like
my friends to 'ave it."</p>

<p>"I'll buy her of you at the price you gave," said Val with
sudden resolution.</p>

<p>"No," said Monsieur Profond. "You take her. I don' want
her."</p>

<p>"Hang it! one doesn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why not?" smiled Monsieur Profond. "I'm a friend of your
family."</p>

<p>"Seven hundred and fifty guineas is not a box of cigars," said
Val impatiently.</p>

<p>"All right; you keep her for me till I want her, and do what you
like with her."</p>

<p>"So long as she's yours," said Val. "I don't mind that."</p>

<p>"That's all right," murmured Monsieur Profond, and moved
away.</p>

<p>Val watched; he might be "a good devil," but then again he might
not. He saw him rejoin George Forsyte, and thereafter saw him no
more.</p>

<p>He spent those nights after racing at his mother's house in
Green Street.</p>

<p>Winifred Dartie at sixty-two was marvellously preserved,
considering the three-and-thirty years during which she had put up
with Montague Dartie, till almost happily released by a French
staircase. It was to her a vehement satisfaction to have her
favourite son back from South Africa after all this time, to feel
him so little changed, and to have taken a fancy to his wife.
Winifred, who in the late seventies, before her marriage, had been
in the vanguard of freedom, pleasure, and fashion, confessed her
youth outclassed by the donzellas of the day. They seemed, for
instance, to regard marriage as an incident, and Winifred sometimes
regretted that she had not done the same; a second, third, fourth
incident might have secured her a partner of less dazzling
inebriety; though, after all, he had left her Val, Imogen, Maud,
Benedict (almost a colonel and unharmed by the War)&mdash;none of
whom had been divorced as yet. The steadiness of her children often
amazed one who remembered their father; but, as she was fond of
believing, they were really all Forsytes, favouring herself, with
the exception, perhaps, of Imogen. Her brother's "little girl"
Fleur frankly puzzled Winifred. The child was as restless as any of
these modern young women&mdash;"She's a small flame in a draught,"
Prosper Profond had said one day after dinner&mdash;but she did not
flop, or talk at the top of her voice. The steady Forsyteism in
Winifred's own character instinctively resented the feeling in the
air, the modern girl's habits and her motto: "All's much of a
muchness! Spend, to-morrow we shall be poor!" She found it a saving
grace in Fleur that, having set her heart on a thing, she had no
change of heart until she got it&mdash;though&mdash;what happened
after, Fleur was, of course, too young to have made evident. The
child was a "very pretty little thing," too, and quite a credit to
take about, with her mother's French taste and gift for wearing
clothes; everybody turned to look at Fleur&mdash;great
consideration to Winifred, a lover of the style and distinction
which had so cruelly deceived her in the case of Montague
Dartie.</p>

<p>In discussing her with Val, at breakfast on Saturday morning,
Winifred dwelt on the family skeleton.</p>

<p>"That little affair of your father-in-law and your Aunt Irene,
Val&mdash;it's old as the hills, of course, Fleur need know nothing
about it&mdash;making a fuss. Your Uncle Soames is very particular
about that. So you'll be careful."</p>

<p>"Yes! But it's dashed awkward&mdash;Holly's young half-brother
is coming to live with us while he learns farming. He's there
already."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Winifred. "That is a gaff! What is he like?"</p>

<p>"Only saw him once&mdash;at Robin Hill, when we were home in
1909; he was naked and painted blue and yellow in stripes&mdash;a
jolly little chap."</p>

<p>Winifred thought that "rather nice," and added comfortably:
"Well, Holly's sensible; she'll know how to deal with it. I shan't
tell your uncle. It'll only bother him. It's a great comfort to
have you back, my dear boy, now that I'm getting on."</p>

<p>"Getting on! Why! you're as young as ever. That chap Profond,
Mother, is he all right?"</p>

<p>"Prosper Profond! Oh! the most amusing man I know."</p>

<p>Val grunted, and recounted the story of the Mayfly filly.</p>

<p>"That's so like him," murmured Winifred. "He does all sorts of
things."</p>

<p>"Well," said Val shrewdly, "our family haven't been too lucky
with that kind of cattle; they're too light-hearted for us."</p>

<p>It was true, and Winifred's blue study lasted a full minute
before she answered:</p>

<p>"Oh! well! He's a foreigner, Val; one must make allowances."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll use his filly and make it up to him,
somehow."</p>

<p>And soon after he gave her his blessing, received a kiss, and
left her for his bookmaker's, the Iseeum Club, and Victoria
station.</p>

<h3>VI.&mdash;JON</h3>

<p>Mrs. Val Dartie, after twenty years of South Africa, had fallen
deeply in love, fortunately with something of her own, for the
object of her passion was the prospect in front of her windows, the
cool clear light on the green Downs. It was England again, at last!
England more beautiful than she had dreamed. Chance had, in fact,
guided the Val Darties to a spot where the South Downs had real
charm when the sun shone. Holly had enough of her father's eye to
apprehend the rare quality of their outlines and chalky radiance;
to go up there by the ravine-like lane and wander along toward
Chanctonbury or Amberley, was still a delight which she hardly
attempted to share with Val, whose admiration of Nature was
confused by a Forsyte's instinct for getting something out of it,
such as the condition of the turf for his horses' exercise.</p>

<p>Driving the Ford home with a certain humouring, smoothness, she
promised herself that the first use she would make of Jon would be
to take him up there, and show him "the view" under this May-day
sky.</p>

<p>She was looking forward to her young half-brother with a
motherliness not exhausted by Val. A three-day visit to Robin Hill,
soon after their arrival home, had yielded no sight of him&mdash;he
was still at school; so that her recollection, like Val's, was of a
little sunny-haired boy, striped blue and yellow, down by the
pond.</p>

<p>Those three days at Robin Hill had been exciting, sad,
embarrassing. Memories of her dead brother, memories of Val's
courtship; the ageing of her father, not seen for twenty years,
something funereal in his ironic gentleness which did not escape
one who had much subtle instinct; above all, the presence of her
stepmother, whom she could still vaguely remember as the "lady in
grey" of days when she was little and grandfather alive and
Mademoiselle Beauce so cross because that intruder gave her music
lessons&mdash;all these confused and tantalised a spirit which had
longed to find Robin Hill untroubled. But Holly was adept at
keeping things to herself, and all had seemed to go quite well.</p>

<p>Her father had kissed her when she left him, with lips which she
was sure had trembled.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," he said, "the War hasn't changed Robin Hill,
has it? If only you could have brought Jolly back with you! I say,
can you stand this spiritualistic racket? When the oak-tree dies,
it dies, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>From the warmth of her embrace he probably divined that he had
let the cat out of the bag, for he rode off at once on irony.</p>

<p>"Spiritualism&mdash;queer word, when the more they manifest the
more they prove that they've got hold of matter."</p>

<p>"How?" said Holly.</p>

<p>"Why! Look at their photographs of auric presences. You must
have something material for light and shade to fall on before you
can take a photograph. No, it'll end in our calling all matter
spirit, or all spirit matter&mdash;I don't know which."</p>

<p>"But don't you believe in survival, Dad?"</p>

<p>Jolyon had looked at her, and the sad whimsicality of his face
impressed her deeply.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, I should like to get something out of death.
I've been looking into it a bit. But for the life of me I can't
find anything that telepathy, sub-consciousness, and emanation from
the storehouse of this world can't account for just as well. Wish I
could! Wishes father thought but they don't breed evidence." Holly
had pressed her lips again to his forehead with the feeling that it
confirmed his theory that all matter was becoming spirit&mdash;his
brow felt, somehow, so insubstantial.</p>

<p>But the most poignant memory of that little visit had been
watching, unobserved, her stepmother reading to herself a letter
from Jon. It was&mdash;she decided&mdash;the prettiest sight she
had ever seen. Irene, lost as it were in the letter of her boy,
stood at a window where the light fell on her face and her fine
grey hair; her lips were moving, smiling, her dark eyes laughing,
dancing, and the hand which did not hold the letter was pressed
against her breast. Holly withdrew as from a vision of perfect
love, convinced that Jon must be nice.</p>

<p>When she saw him coming out of the station with a kit-bag in
either hand, she was confirmed in her predisposition. He was a
little like Jolly, that long-lost idol of her childhood, but
eager-looking and less formal, with deeper eyes and
brighter-coloured hair, for he wore no hat; altogether a very
interesting "little" brother!</p>

<p>His tentative politeness charmed one who was accustomed to
assurance in the youthful manner; he was disturbed because she was
to drive him home, instead of his driving her. Shouldn't he have a
shot? They hadn't a car at Robin Hill since the War, of course, and
he had only driven once, and landed up a bank, so she oughtn't to
mind his trying. His laugh, soft and infectious, was very
attractive, though that word, she had heard, was now quite
old-fashioned. When they reached the house he pulled out a crumpled
letter which she read while he was washing&mdash;a quite short
letter, which must have cost her father many a pang to write.</p>

<blockquote>"MY DEAR,<br>
<br>
"You and Val will not forget, I trust, that Jon knows nothing of
family history. His mother and I think he is too young at present.
The boy is very dear, and the apple of her eye. Verbum
sapientibus,<br>
<br>
"Your loving father,<br>
"J. F."</blockquote>

<p>That was all; but it renewed in Holly an uneasy regret that
Fleur was coming.</p>

<p>After tea she fulfilled that promise to herself and took Jon up
the hill. They had a long talk, sitting above an old chalk-pit
grown over with brambles and goosepenny. Milkwort and liverwort
starred the green slope, the larks sang, and thrushes in the brake,
and now and then a gull flighting inland would wheel very white
against the paling sky, where the vague moon was coming up.
Delicious fragrance came to them, as if little invisible creatures
were running and treading scent out of the blades of grass.</p>

<p>Jon, who had fallen silent, said rather suddenly:</p>

<p>"I say, this is wonderful! There's no fat on it at all. Gull's
flight and sheep-bells."</p>

<p>"'Gull's flight and sheep-bells'! You're a poet, my dear!"</p>

<p>Jon sighed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Golly! No go!"</p>

<p>"Try! I used to at your age."</p>

<p>"Did you? Mother says 'try' too; but I'm so rotten. Have you any
of yours for me to see?"</p>

<p>"My dear," Holly murmured, "I've been married nineteen years. I
only wrote verses when I wanted to be."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Jon, and turned over on his face: the one cheek she
could see was a charming colour. Was Jon "touched in the wind,"
then, as Val would have called it? Already? But, if so, all the
better, he would take no notice of young Fleur. Besides, on Monday
he would begin his farming. And she smiled. Was it Burns who
followed the plough, or only Piers Plowman? Nearly every young man
and most young women seemed to be poets now, judging from the
number of their books she had read out in South Africa, importing
them from Hatchus and Bumphards; and quite good&mdash;oh! quite;
much better than she had been herself! But then poetry had only
really come in since her day&mdash;with motor-cars. Another long
talk after dinner over a wood fire in the low hall, and there
seemed little left to know about Jon except anything of real
importance. Holly parted from him at his bedroom door, having seen
twice over that he had everything, with the conviction that she
would love him, and Val would like him. He was eager, but did not
gush; he was a splendid listener, sympathetic, reticent about
himself. He evidently loved their father, and adored his mother. He
liked riding, rowing, and fencing better than games. He saved moths
from candles, and couldn't bear spiders, but put them out of doors
in screws of paper sooner than kill them. In a word, he was
amiable. She went to sleep, thinking that he would suffer horribly
if anybody hurt him; but who would hurt him?</p>

<p>Jon, on the other hand, sat awake at his window with a bit of
paper and a pencil, writing his first "real poem" by the light of a
candle because there was not enough moon to see by, only enough to
make the night seem fluttery and as if engraved on silver. Just the
night for Fleur to walk, and turn her eyes, and lead on-over the
hills and far away. And Jon, deeply furrowed in his ingenuous brow,
made marks on the paper and rubbed them out and wrote them in
again, and did all that was necessary for the completion of a work
of art; and he had a feeling such as the winds of Spring must have,
trying their first songs among the coming blossom. Jon was one of
those boys (not many) in whom a home-trained love of beauty had
survived school life. He had had to keep it to himself, of course,
so that not even the drawing-master knew of it; but it was there,
fastidious and clear within him. And his poem seemed to him as lame
and stilted as the night was winged. But he kept it, all the same.
It was a "beast," but better than nothing as an expression of the
inexpressible. And he thought with a sort of discomfiture: 'I
shan't be able to show it to Mother.' He slept terribly well, when
he did sleep, overwhelmed by novelty.</p>

<hr>

<h3>VII.&mdash;FLEUR</h3>

<p>To avoid the awkwardness of questions which could not be
answered, all that had been told Jon was:</p>

<p>"There's a girl coming down with Val for the week-end."</p>

<p>For the same reason, all that had been told Fleur was: "We've
got a youngster staying with us."</p>

<p>The two yearlings, as Val called them in his thoughts, met
therefore in a manner which for unpreparedness left nothing to be
desired. They were thus introduced by Holly:</p>

<p>"This is Jon, my little brother; Fleur's a cousin of ours,
Jon."</p>

<p>Jon, who was coming in through a French window out of strong
sunlight, was so confounded by the providential nature of this
miracle, that he had time to hear Fleur say calmly: "Oh, how do you
do?" as if he had never seen her, and to understand dimly from the
quickest imaginable little movement of her head that he never had
seen her. He bowed therefore over her hand in an intoxicated
manner, and became more silent than the grave. He knew better than
to speak. Once in his early life, surprised reading by a
nightlight, he had said fatuously "I was just turning over the
leaves, Mum," and his mother had replied: "Jon, never tell stories,
because of your face nobody will ever believe them."</p>

<p>The saying had permanently undermined the confidence necessary
to the success of spoken untruth. He listened therefore to Fleur's
swift and rapt allusions to the jolliness of everything, plied her
with scones and jam, and got away as soon as might be. They say
that in delirium tremens you see a fixed object, preferably dark,
which suddenly changes shape and position. Jon saw the fixed
object; it had dark eyes and passably dark hair, and changed its
position, but never its shape. The knowledge that between him and
that object there was already a secret understanding (however
impossible to understand) thrilled him so that he waited
feverishly, and began to copy out his poem&mdash;which of course he
would never dare to&mdash;show her&mdash;till the sound of horses'
hoofs roused him, and, leaning from his window, he saw her riding
forth with Val. It was clear that she wasted no time, but the sight
filled him with grief. He wasted his. If he had not bolted, in his
fearful ecstasy, he might have been asked to go too. And from his
window he sat and watched them disappear, appear again in the chine
of the road, vanish, and emerge once more for a minute clear on the
outline of the Down. 'Silly brute!' he thought; 'I always miss my
chances.'</p>

<p>Why couldn't he be self-confident and ready? And, leaning his
chin on his hands, he imagined the ride he might have had with her.
A week-end was but a week-end, and he had missed three hours of it.
Did he know any one except himself who would have been such a flat?
He did not.</p>

<p>He dressed for dinner early, and was first down. He would miss
no more. But he missed Fleur, who came down last. He sat opposite
her at dinner, and it was terrible&mdash;impossible to say anything
for fear of saying the wrong thing, impossible to keep his eyes
fixed on her in the only natural way; in sum, impossible to treat
normally one with whom in fancy he had already been over the hills
and far away; conscious, too, all the time, that he must seem to
her, to all of them, a dumb gawk. Yes, it was terrible! And she was
talking so well&mdash;swooping with swift wing this way and that.
Wonderful how she had learned an art which he found so disgustingly
difficult. She must think him hopeless indeed!</p>

<p>His sister's eyes, fixed on him with a certain astonishment,
obliged him at last to look at Fleur; but instantly her eyes, very
wide and eager, seeming to say, "Oh! for goodness' sake!" obliged
him to look at Val, where a grin obliged him to look at his
cutlet&mdash;that, at least, had no eyes, and no grin, and he ate
it hastily.</p>

<p>"Jon is going to be a farmer," he heard Holly say; "a farmer and
a poet."</p>

<p>He glanced up reproachfully, caught the comic lift of her
eyebrow just like their father's, laughed, and felt better.</p>

<p>Val recounted the incident of Monsieur Prosper Profond; nothing
could have been more favourable, for, in relating it, he regarded
Holly, who in turn regarded him, while Fleur seemed to be regarding
with a slight frown some thought of her own, and Jon was really
free to look at her at last. She had on a white frock, very simple
and well made; her arms were bare, and her hair had a white rose in
it. In just that swift moment of free vision, after such intense
discomfort, Jon saw her sublimated, as one sees in the dark a
slender white fruit-tree; caught her like a verse of poetry flashed
before the eyes of the mind, or a tune which floats out in the
distance and dies. He wondered giddily how old she was&mdash;she
seemed so much more self-possessed and experienced than himself.
Why mustn't he say they had met? He remembered suddenly his
mother's face; puzzled, hurt-looking, when she answered: "Yes,
they're relations, but we don't know them." Impossible that his
mother, who loved beauty, should not admire Fleur if she did know
her.</p>

<p>Alone with Val after dinner, he sipped port deferentially and
answered the advances of this new-found brother-in-law. As to
riding (always the first consideration with Val) he could have the
young chestnut, saddle and unsaddle it himself, and generally look
after it when he brought it in. Jon said he was accustomed to all
that at home, and saw that he had gone up one in his host's
estimation.</p>

<p>"Fleur," said Val, "can't ride much yet, but she's keen. Of
course, her father doesn't know a horse from a cart-wheel. Does
your Dad ride?"</p>

<p>"He used to; but now he's&mdash;you know, he's&mdash;" He
stopped, so hating the word "old." His father was old, and yet not
old; no&mdash;never!</p>

<p>"Quite," muttered Val. "I used to know your brother up at
Oxford, ages ago, the one who died in the Boer War. We had a fight
in New College Gardens. That was a queer business," he added,
musing; "a good deal came out of it."</p>

<p>Jon's eyes opened wide; all was pushing him toward historical
research, when his sister's voice said gently from the doorway:</p>

<p>"Come along, you two," and he rose, his heart pushing him toward
something far more modern.</p>

<p>Fleur having declared that it was "simply too wonderful to stay
indoors," they all went out. Moonlight was frosting the dew, and an
old sundial threw a long shadow. Two box hedges at right angles,
dark and square, barred off the orchard. Fleur turned through that
angled opening.</p>

<p>"Come on!" she called. Jon glanced at the others, and followed.
She was running among the trees like a ghost. All was lovely and
foamlike above her, and there was a scent of old trunks, and of
nettles. She vanished. He thought he had lost her, then almost ran
into her standing quite still.</p>

<p>"Isn't it jolly?" she cried, and Jon answered:</p>

<p>"Rather!"</p>

<p>She reached up, twisted off a blossom and, twirling it in her
fingers, said:</p>

<p>"I suppose I can call you Jon?"</p>

<p>"I should think so just."</p>

<p>"All right! But you know there's a feud between our
families?"</p>

<p>Jon stammered: "Feud? Why?"</p>

<p>"It's ever so romantic and silly. That's why I pretended we
hadn't met. Shall we get up early to-morrow morning and go for a
walk before breakfast and have it out? I hate being slow about
things, don't you?"</p>

<p>Jon murmured a rapturous assent.</p>

<p>"Six o'clock, then. I think your mother's beautiful"</p>

<p>Jon said fervently: "Yes, she is."</p>

<p>"I love all kinds of beauty," went on Fleur, "when it's
exciting. I don't like Greek things a bit."</p>

<p>"What! Not Euripides?"</p>

<p>"Euripides? Oh! no, I can't bear Greek plays; they're so long. I
think beauty's always swift. I like to look at one picture, for
instance, and then run off. I can't bear a lot of things together.
Look!" She held up her blossom in the moonlight. "That's better
than all the orchard, I think."</p>

<p>And, suddenly, with her other hand she caught Jon's.</p>

<p>"Of all things in the world, don't you think caution's the most
awful? Smell the moonlight!"</p>

<p>She thrust the blossom against his face; Jon agreed giddily that
of all things in the world caution was the worst, and bending over,
kissed the hand which held his.</p>

<p>"That's nice and old-fashioned," said Fleur calmly. "You're
frightfully silent, Jon. Still I like silence when it's swift." She
let go his hand. "Did you think I dropped my handkerchief on
purpose?"</p>

<p>"No!" cried Jon, intensely shocked.</p>

<p>"Well, I did, of course. Let's get back, or they'll think we're
doing this on purpose too." And again she ran like a ghost among
the trees. Jon followed, with love in his heart, Spring in his
heart, and over all the moonlit white unearthly blossom. They came
out where they had gone in, Fleur walking demurely.</p>

<p>"It's quite wonderful in there," she said dreamily to Holly.</p>

<p>Jon preserved silence, hoping against hope that she might be
thinking it swift.</p>

<p>She bade him a casual and demure good-night, which made him
think he had been dreaming...</p>

<p>In her bedroom Fleur had flung off her gown, and, wrapped in a
shapeless garment, with the white flower still in her hair, she
looked like a mousme, sitting cross-legged on her bed, writing by
candlelight.</p>

<blockquote>"DEAREST CHERRY,<br>
"I believe I'm in love. I've got it in the neck, only the feeling
is really lower down. He's a second cousin-such a child, about six
months older and ten years younger than I am. Boys always fall in
love with their seniors, and girls with their juniors or with old
men of forty. Don't laugh, but his eyes are the truest things I
ever saw; and he's quite divinely silent! We had a most romantic
first meeting in London under the Vospovitch Juno. And now he's
sleeping in the next room and the moonlight's on the blossom; and
to-morrow morning, before anybody's awake, we're going to walk off
into Down fairyland. There's a feud between our families, which
makes it really exciting. Yes! and I may have to use subterfuge and
come on you for invitations&mdash;if so, you'll know why! My father
doesn't want us to know each other, but I can't help that. Life's
too short. He's got the most beautiful mother, with lovely silvery
hair and a young face with dark eyes. I'm staying with his
sister&mdash;who married my cousin; it's all mixed up, but I mean
to pump her to-morrow. We've often talked about love being a
spoil-sport; well, that's all tosh, it's the beginning of sport,
and the sooner you feel it, my dear, the better for you.<br>
<br>
"Jon (not simplified spelling, but short for Jolyon, which is a
name in my family, they say) is the sort that lights up and goes
out; about five feet ten, still growing, and I believe he's going
to be a poet. If you laugh at me I've done with you forever. I
perceive all sorts of difficulties, but you know when I really want
a thing I get it. One of the chief effects of love is that you see
the air sort of inhabited, like seeing a face in the moon; and you
feel&mdash;you feel dancey and soft at the same time, with a funny
sensation&mdash;like a continual first sniff of
orange&mdash;blossom&mdash;Just above your stays. This is my first,
and I feel as if it were going to be my last, which is absurd, of
course, by all the laws of Nature and morality. If you mock me I
will smite you, and if you tell anybody I will never forgive you.
So much so, that I almost don't think I'll send this letter.
Anyway, I'll sleep over it. So good-night, my Cherry&mdash;oh!<br>
<br>
"Your,<br>
"FLEUR."</blockquote>

<h3>VIII.&mdash;IDYLL ON GRASS</h3>

<p>When those two young Forsytes emerged from the chine lane, and
set their faces east toward the sun, there was not a cloud in
heaven, and the Downs were dewy. They had come at a good bat up the
slope and were a little out of breath; if they had anything to say
they did not say it, but marched in the early awkwardness of
unbreakfasted morning under the songs of the larks. The stealing
out had been fun, but with the freedom of the tops the sense of
conspiracy ceased, and gave place to dumbness.</p>

<p>"We've made one blooming error," said Fleur, when they had gone
half a mile. "I'm hungry."</p>

<p>Jon produced a stick of chocolate. They shared it and their
tongues were loosened. They discussed the nature of their homes and
previous existences, which had a kind of fascinating unreality up
on that lonely height. There remained but one thing solid in Jon's
past&mdash;his mother; but one thing solid in Fleur's&mdash;her
father; and of these figures, as though seen in the distance with
disapproving faces, they spoke little.</p>

<p>The Down dipped and rose again toward Chanctonbury Ring; a
sparkle of far sea came into view, a sparrow-hawk hovered in the
sun's eye so that the blood-nourished brown of his wings gleamed
nearly red. Jon had a passion for birds, and an aptitude for
sitting very still to watch them; keen-sighted, and with a memory
for what interested him, on birds he was almost worth listening to.
But in Chanctonbury Ring there were none&mdash;its great beech
temple was empty of life, and almost chilly at this early hour;
they came out willingly again into the sun on the far side. It was
Fleur's turn now. She spoke of dogs, and the way people treated
them. It was wicked to keep them on chains! She would like to flog
people who did that. Jon was astonished to find her so
humanitarian. She knew a dog, it seemed, which some farmer near her
home kept chained up at the end of his chicken run, in all
weathers, till it had almost lost its voice from barking!</p>

<p>"And the misery is," she said vehemently, "that if the poor
thing didn't bark at every one who passes it wouldn't be kept
there. I do think men are cunning brutes. I've let it go twice, on
the sly; it's nearly bitten me both times, and then it goes simply
mad with joy; but it always runs back home at last, and they chain
it up again. If I had my way, I'd chain that man up." Jon saw her
teeth and her eyes gleam. "I'd brand him on his forehead with the
word 'Brute'; that would teach him!"</p>

<p>Jon agreed that it would be a good remedy.</p>

<p>"It's their sense of property," he said, "which makes people
chain things. The last generation thought of nothing but property;
and that's why there was the War."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Fleur, "I never thought of that. Your people and mine
quarrelled about property. And anyway we've all got it&mdash;at
least, I suppose your people have."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, luckily; I don't suppose I shall be any good at making
money."</p>

<p>"If you were, I don't believe I should like you."</p>

<p>Jon slipped his hand tremulously under her arm. Fleur looked
straight before her and chanted:</p>

<p>"Jon, Jon, the farmer's son, Stole a pig, and away he run!"</p>

<p>Jon's arm crept round her waist.</p>

<p>"This is rather sudden," said Fleur calmly; "do you often do
it?"</p>

<p>Jon dropped his arm. But when she laughed his arm stole back
again; and Fleur began to sing:</p>

<p>"O who will oer the downs so free, O who will with me ride? O
who will up and follow me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sing, Jon!"</p>

<p>Jon sang. The larks joined in, sheep-bells, and an early morning
church far away over in Steyning. They went on from tune to tune,
till Fleur said:</p>

<p>"My God! I am hungry now!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I am sorry!"</p>

<p>She looked round into his face.</p>

<p>"Jon, you're rather a darling."</p>

<p>And she pressed his hand against her waist. Jon almost reeled
from happiness. A yellow-and-white dog coursing a hare startled
them apart. They watched the two vanish down the slope, till Fleur
said with a sigh: "He'll never catch it, thank goodness! What's the
time? Mine's stopped. I never wound it."</p>

<p>Jon looked at his watch. "By Jove!" he said, "mine's stopped;
too."</p>

<p>They walked on again, but only hand in hand.</p>

<p>"If the grass is dry," said Fleur, "let's sit down for half a
minute."</p>

<p>Jon took off his coat, and they shared it.</p>

<p>"Smell! Actually wild thyme!"</p>

<p>With his arm round her waist again, they sat some minutes in
silence.</p>

<p>"We are goats!" cried Fleur, jumping up; "we shall be most
fearfully late, and look so silly, and put them on their guard.
Look here, Jon We only came out to get an appetite for breakfast,
and lost our way. See?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jon.</p>

<p>"It's serious; there'll be a stopper put on us. Are you a good
liar?"</p>

<p>"I believe not very; but I can try."</p>

<p>Fleur frowned.</p>

<p>"You know," she said, "I realize that they don't mean us to be
friends."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I told you why."</p>

<p>"But that's silly."</p>

<p>"Yes; but you don't know my father!"</p>

<p>"I suppose he's fearfully fond of you."</p>

<p>"You see, I'm an only child. And so are you&mdash;of your
mother. Isn't it a bore? There's so much expected of one. By the
time they've done expecting, one's as good as dead."</p>

<p>"Yes," muttered Jon, "life's beastly short. One wants to live
forever, and know everything."</p>

<p>"And love everybody?"</p>

<p>"No," cried Jon; "I only want to love once&mdash;you."</p>

<p>"Indeed! You're coming on! Oh! Look! There's the chalk-pit; we
can't be very far now. Let's run."</p>

<p>Jon followed, wondering fearfully if he had offended her.</p>

<p>The chalk-pit was full of sunshine and the murmuration of bees.
Fleur flung back her hair.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "in case of accidents, you may give me one
kiss, Jon," and she pushed her cheek forward. With ecstasy he
kissed that hot soft cheek.</p>

<p>"Now, remember! We lost our way; and leave it to me as much as
you can. I'm going to be rather beastly to you; it's safer; try and
be beastly to me!"</p>

<p>Jon shook his head. "That's impossible."</p>

<p>"Just to please me; till five o'clock, at all events."</p>

<p>"Anybody will be able to see through it," said Jon gloomily.</p>

<p>"Well, do your best. Look! There they are! Wave your hat! Oh!
you haven't got one. Well, I'll cooee! Get a little away from me,
and look sulky."</p>

<p>Five minutes later, entering the house and doing his utmost to
look sulky, Jon heard her clear voice in the dining-room:</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm simply ravenous! He's going to be a farmer&mdash;and he
loses his way! The boy's an idiot!"</p>

<h3>IX. GOYA</h3>

<p>Lunch was over and Soames mounted to the picture-gallery in his
house near Mapleduram. He had what Annette called "a grief." Fleur
was not yet home. She had been expected on Wednesday; had wired
that it would be Friday; and again on Friday that it would be
Sunday afternoon; and here were her aunt, and her cousins the
Cardigans, and this fellow Profond, and everything flat as a
pancake for the want of her. He stood before his
Gauguin&mdash;sorest point of his collection. He had bought the
ugly great thing with two early Matisses before the War, because
there was such a fuss about those Post-Impressionist chaps. He was
wondering whether Profond would take them off his hands&mdash;the
fellow seemed not to know what to do with his money&mdash;when he
heard his sister's voice say: "I think that's a horrid thing,
Soames," and saw that Winifred had followed him up.</p>

<p>"Oh! you do?" he said dryly; "I gave five hundred for it."</p>

<p>"Fancy! Women aren't made like that even if they are black."</p>

<p>Soames uttered a glum laugh. "You didn't come up to tell me
that."</p>

<p>"No. Do you know that Jolyon's boy is staying with Val and his
wife?"</p>

<p>Soames spun round.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Yes," drawled Winifred; "he's gone to live with them there
while he learns farming."</p>

<p>Soames had turned away, but her voice pursued him as he walked
up and down. "I warned Val that neither of them was to be spoken to
about old matters."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me before?"</p>

<p>Winifred shrugged her substantial shoulders.</p>

<p>"Fleur does what she likes. You've always spoiled her. Besides,
my dear boy, what's the harm?"</p>

<p>"The harm!" muttered Soames. "Why, she&mdash;" he checked
himself. The Juno, the handkerchief, Fleur's eyes, her questions,
and now this delay in her return&mdash;the symptoms seemed to him
so sinister that, faithful to his nature, he could not part with
them.</p>

<p>"I think you take too much care," said Winifred. "If I were you,
I should tell her of that old matter. It's no good thinking that
girls in these days are as they used to be. Where they pick up
their knowledge I can't tell, but they seem to know
everything."</p>

<p>Over Soames' face, closely composed, passed a sort of spasm, and
Winifred added hastily:</p>

<p>"If you don't like to speak of it, I could for you."</p>

<p>Soames shook his head. Unless there was absolute necessity the
thought that his adored daughter should learn of that old scandal
hurt his pride too much.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "not yet. Never if I can help it.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my dear. Think what people are!"</p>

<p>"Twenty years is a long time," muttered Soames. "Outside our
family, who's likely to remember?"</p>

<p>Winifred was silenced. She inclined more and more to that peace
and quietness of which Montague Dartie had deprived her in her
youth. And, since pictures always depressed her, she soon went down
again.</p>

<p>Soames passed into the corner where, side by side, hung his real
Goya and the copy of the fresco "La Vendimia." His acquisition of
the real Goya rather beautifully illustrated the cobweb of vested
interests and passions which mesh the bright-winged fly of human
life. The real Goya's noble owner's ancestor had come into
possession of it during some Spanish war&mdash;it was in a word
loot. The noble owner had remained in ignorance of its value until
in the nineties an enterprising critic discovered that a Spanish
painter named Goya was a genius. It was only a fair Goya, but
almost unique in England, and the noble owner became a marked man.
Having many possessions and that aristocratic culture which,
independent of mere sensuous enjoyment, is founded on the sounder
principle that one must know everything and be fearfully interested
in life, he had fully intended to keep an article which contributed
to his reputation while he was alive, and to leave it to the nation
after he was dead. Fortunately for Soames, the House of Lords was
violently attacked in 1909, and the noble owner became alarmed and
angry. 'If,' he said to himself, 'they think they can have it both
ways they are very much mistaken. So long as they leave me in quiet
enjoyment the nation can have some of my pictures at my death. But
if the nation is going to bait me, and rob me like this, I'm damned
if I won't sell the lot. They can't have my private property and my
public spirit-both.' He brooded in this fashion for several months
till one morning, after reading the speech of a certain statesman,
he telegraphed to his agent to come down and bring Bodkin. On going
over the collection Bodkin, than whose opinion on market values
none was more sought, pronounced that with a free hand to sell to
America, Germany, and other places where there was an interest in
art, a lot more money could be made than by selling in England. The
noble owner's public spirit&mdash;he said&mdash;was well known but
the pictures were unique. The noble owner put this opinion in his
pipe and smoked it for a year. At the end of that time he read
another speech by the same statesman, and telegraphed to his
agents: "Give Bodkin a free hand." It was at this juncture that
Bodkin conceived the idea which salved the Goya and two other
unique pictures for the native country of the noble owner. With one
hand Bodkin proffered the pictures to the foreign market, with the
other he formed a list of private British collectors. Having
obtained what he considered the highest possible bids from across
the seas, he submitted pictures and bids to the private British
collectors, and invited them, of their public spirit, to outbid. In
three instances (including the Goya) out of twenty-one he was
successful. And why? One of the private collectors made
buttons&mdash;he had made so many that he desired that his wife
should be called Lady "Buttons." He therefore bought a unique
picture at great cost, and gave it to the nation. It was "part,"
his friends said, "of his general game." The second of the private
collectors was an Americophobe, and bought an unique picture to
"spite the damned Yanks." The third of the private collectors was
Soames, who&mdash;more sober than either of the others&mdash;bought
after a visit to Madrid, because he was certain that Goya was still
on the up grade. Goya was not booming at the moment, but he would
come again; and, looking at that portrait, Hogarthian, Manetesque
in its directness, but with its own queer sharp beauty of paint, he
was perfectly satisfied still that he had made no error, heavy
though the price had been&mdash;heaviest he had ever paid. And next
to it was hanging the copy of "La Vendimia." There she
was&mdash;the little wretch-looking back at him in her dreamy mood,
the mood he loved best because he felt so much safer when she
looked like that.</p>

<p>He was still gazing when the scent of a cigar impinged on his
nostrils, and a voice said:</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Forsyde, what you goin' to do with this small
lot?"</p>

<p>That Belgian chap, whose mother-as if Flemish blood were not
enough&mdash;had been Armenian! Subduing a natural irritation, he
said:</p>

<p>"Are you a judge of pictures?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've got a few myself."</p>

<p>"Any Post-Impressionists?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es, I rather like them."</p>

<p>"What do you think of this?" said Soames, pointing to the
Gauguin.</p>

<p>Monsieur Profond protruded his lower lip and short pointed
beard.</p>

<p>"Rather fine, I think," he said; "do you want to sell it?"</p>

<p>Soames checked his instinctive "Not particularly"&mdash;he would
not chaffer with this alien.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"What do you want for it?"</p>

<p>"What I gave."</p>

<p>"All right," said Monsieur Profond. "I'll be glad to take that
small picture. Post-Impressionists&mdash;they're awful dead, but
they're amusin'. I don' care for pictures much, but I've got some,
just a small lot."</p>

<p>"What do you care for?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Profond shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Life's awful like a lot of monkeys scramblin' for empty
nuts."</p>

<p>"You're young," said Soames. If the fellow must make a
generalization, he needn't suggest that the forms of property
lacked solidity!</p>

<p>"I don' worry," replied Monsieur Profond smiling; "we're born,
and we die. Half the world's starvin'. I feed a small lot of babies
out in my mother's country; but what's the use? Might as well throw
my money in the river."</p>

<p>Soames looked at him, and turned back toward his Goya. He didn't
know what the fellow wanted.</p>

<p>"What shall I make my cheque for?" pursued Monsieur Profond.</p>

<p>"Five hundred," said Soames shortly; "but I don't want you to
take it if you don't care for it more than that."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Monsieur Profond; "I'll be 'appy to
'ave that picture."</p>

<p>He wrote a cheque with a fountain-pen heavily chased with gold.
Soames watched the process uneasily. How on earth had the fellow
known that he wanted to sell that picture? Monsieur Profond held
out the cheque.</p>

<p>"The English are awful funny about pictures," he said. "So are
the French, so are my people. They're all awful funny."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," said Soames stiffly.</p>

<p>"It's like hats," said Monsieur Profond enigmatically, "small or
large, turnin' up or down&mdash;just the fashion. Awful funny."
And, smiling, he drifted out of the gallery again, blue and solid
like the smoke of his excellent cigar.</p>

<p>Soames had taken the cheque, feeling as if the intrinsic value
of ownership had been called in question. 'He's a cosmopolitan,' he
thought, watching Profond emerge from under the verandah with
Annette, and saunter down the lawn toward the river. What his wife
saw in the fellow he didn't know, unless it was that he could speak
her language; and there passed in Soames what Monsieur Profond
would have called a "small doubt" whether Annette was not too
handsome to be walking with any one so "cosmopolitan." Even at that
distance he could see the blue fumes from Profond's cigar wreath
out in the quiet sunlight; and his grey buckskin shoes, and his
grey hat&mdash;the fellow was a dandy! And he could see the quick
turn of his wife's head, so very straight on her desirable neck and
shoulders. That turn of her neck always seemed to him a little too
showy, and in the "Queen of all I survey" manner&mdash;not quite
distinguished. He watched them walk along the path at the bottom of
the garden. A young man in flannels joined them down there&mdash;a
Sunday caller no doubt, from up the river. He went back to his
Goya. He was still staring at that replica of Fleur, and worrying
over Winifred's news, when his wife's voice said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Michael Mont, Soames. You invited him to see your
pictures."</p>

<p>There was the cheerful young man of the Gallery off Cork
Street!</p>

<p>"Turned up, you see, sir; I live only four miles from
Pangbourne. Jolly day, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Confronted with the results of his expansiveness, Soames
scrutinized his visitor. The young man's mouth was excessively
large and curly&mdash;he seemed always grinning. Why didn't he grow
the rest of those idiotic little moustaches, which made him look
like a music-hall buffoon? What on earth were young men about,
deliberately lowering their class with these tooth-brushes, or
little slug whiskers? Ugh! Affected young idiots! In other respects
he was presentable, and his flannels very clean.</p>

<p>"Happy to see you!" he said.</p>

<p>The young man, who had been turning his head from side to side,
became transfixed. "I say!" he said, "'some' picture!"</p>

<p>Soames saw, with mixed sensations, that he had addressed the
remark to the Goya copy.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said dryly, "that's not a Goya. It's a copy. I had it
painted because it reminded me of my daughter."</p>

<p>"By Jove! I thought I knew the face, sir. Is she here?"</p>

<p>The frankness of his interest almost disarmed Soames.</p>

<p>"She'll be in after tea," he said. "Shall we go round the
pictures?"</p>

<p>And Soames began that round which never tired him. He had not
anticipated much intelligence from one who had mistaken a copy for
an original, but as they passed from section to section, period to
period, he was startled by the young man's frank and relevant
remarks. Natively shrewd himself, and even sensuous beneath his
mask, Soames had not spent thirty-eight years over his one hobby
without knowing something more about pictures than their market
values. He was, as it were, the missing link between the artist and
the commercial public. Art for art's sake and all that, of course,
was cant. But aesthetics and good taste were necessary. The
appreciation of enough persons of good taste was what gave a work
of art its permanent market value, or in other words made it "a
work of art." There was no real cleavage. And he was sufficiently
accustomed to sheep-like and unseeing visitors, to be intrigued by
one who did not hesitate to say of Mauve: "Good old haystacks!" or
of James Maris: "Didn't he just paint and paper 'em! Mathew was the
real swell, sir; you could dig into his surfaces!" It was after the
young man had whistled before a Whistler, with the words, "D'you
think he ever really saw a naked woman, sir?" that Soames
remarked:</p>

<p>"What are you, Mr. Mont, if I may ask?"</p>

<p>"I, sir? I was going to be a painter, but the War knocked that.
Then in the trenches, you know, I used to dream of the Stock
Exchange, snug and warm and just noisy enough. But the Peace
knocked that, shares seem off, don't they? I've only been demobbed
about a year. What do you recommend, sir?"</p>

<p>"Have you got money?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered the young man, "I've got a father; I kept him
alive during the War, so he's bound to keep me alive now. Though,
of course, there's the question whether he ought to be allowed to
hang on to his property. What do you think about that, sir?"</p>

<p>Soames, pale and defensive, smiled.</p>

<p>"The old man has fits when I tell him he may have to work yet.
He's got land, you know; it's a fatal disease."</p>

<p>"This is my real Goya," said Soames dryly.</p>

<p>"By George! He was a swell. I saw a Goya in Munich once that
bowled me middle stump. A most evil-looking old woman in the most
gorgeous lace. He made no compromise with the public taste. That
old boy was 'some' explosive; he must have smashed up a lot of
convention in his day. Couldn't he just paint! He makes Velasquez
stiff, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"I have no Velasquez," said Soames.</p>

<p>The young man stared. "No," he said; "only nations or profiteers
can afford him, I suppose. I say, why shouldn't all the bankrupt
nations sell their Velasquez and Titians and other swells to the
profiteers by force, and then pass a law that any one who holds a
picture by an Old Master&mdash;see schedule&mdash;must hang it in a
public gallery? There seems something in that."</p>

<p>"Shall we go down to tea?" said Soames.</p>

<p>The young man's ears seemed to droop on his skull. 'He's not
dense,' thought Soames, following him off the premises.</p>

<p>Goya, with his satiric and surpassing precision, his original
"line," and the daring of his light and shade, could have
reproduced to admiration the group assembled round Annette's
tea-tray in the inglenook below. He alone, perhaps, of painters
would have done justice to the sunlight filtering through a screen
of creeper, to the lovely pallor of brass, the old cut glasses, the
thin slices of lemon in pale amber tea; justice to Annette in her
black lacey dress; there was something of the fair Spaniard in her
beauty, though it lacked the spirituality of that rare type; to
Winifred's grey-haired, corseted solidity; to Soames, of a certain
grey and flat-cheeked distinction; to the vivacious Michael Mont,
pointed in ear and eye; to Imogen, dark, luscious of glance,
growing a little stout; to Prosper Profond, with his expression as
who should say, "Well, Mr. Goya, what's the use of paintin' this
small party?" finally, to Jack Cardigan, with his shining stare and
tanned sanguinity betraying the moving principle: "I'm English, and
I live to be fit."</p>

<p>Curious, by the way, that Imogen, who as a girl had declared
solemnly one day at Timothy's that she would never marry a good
man&mdash;they were so dull&mdash;should have married Jack
Cardigan, in whom health had so destroyed all traces of original
sin, that she might have retired to rest with ten thousand other
Englishmen without knowing the difference from the one she had
chosen to repose beside. "Oh!" she would say of him, in her
"amusing" way, "Jack keeps himself so fearfully fit; he's never had
a day's illness in his life. He went right through the War without
a finger-ache. You really can't imagine how fit he is!" Indeed, he
was so "fit" that he couldn't see when she was flirting, which was
such a comfort in a way. All the same she was quite fond of him, so
far as one could be of a sports-machine, and of the two little
Cardigans made after his pattern. Her eyes just then were comparing
him maliciously with Prosper Profond. There was no "small" sport or
game which Monsieur Profond had not played at too, it seemed, from
skittles to tarpon-fishing, and worn out every one. Imogen would
sometimes wish that they had worn out Jack, who continued to play
at them and talk of them with the simple zeal of a school-girl
learning hockey; at the age of Great-uncle Timothy she well knew
that Jack would be playing carpet golf in her bedroom, and "wiping
somebody's eye."</p>

<p>He was telling them now how he had "pipped the pro&mdash;a
charmin' fellow, playin' a very good game," at the last hole this
morning; and how he had pulled down to Caversham since lunch, and
trying to incite Prosper Profond to play him a set of tennis after
tea&mdash;do him good&mdash;"keep him fit.</p>

<p>"But what's the use of keepin' fit?" said Monsieur Profond.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," murmured Michael Mont, "what do you keep fit
for?"</p>

<p>"Jack," cried Imogen, enchanted, "what do you keep fit for?"</p>

<p>Jack Cardigan stared with all his health. The questions were
like the buzz of a mosquito, and he put up his hand to wipe them
away. During the War, of course, he had kept fit to kill Germans;
now that it was over he either did not know, or shrank in delicacy
from explanation of his moving principle.</p>

<p>"But he's right," said Monsieur Profond unexpectedly, "there's
nothin' left but keepin' fit."</p>

<p>The saying, too deep for Sunday afternoon, would have passed
unanswered, but for the mercurial nature of young Mont.</p>

<p>"Good!" he cried. "That's the great discovery of the War. We all
thought we were progressing&mdash;now we know we're only
changing."</p>

<p>"For the worse," said Monsieur Profond genially.</p>

<p>"How you are cheerful, Prosper!" murmured Annette.</p>

<p>"You come and play tennis!" said Jack Cardigan; "you've got the
hump. We'll soon take that down. D'you play, Mr. Mont?"</p>

<p>"I hit the ball about, sir."</p>

<p>At this juncture Soames rose, ruffled in that deep instinct of
preparation for the future which guided his existence.</p>

<p>"When Fleur comes&mdash;" he heard Jack Cardigan say.</p>

<p>Ah! and why didn't she come? He passed through drawing-room,
hall, and porch out on to the drive, and stood there listening for
the car. All was still and Sundayfied; the lilacs in full flower
scented the air. There were white clouds, like the feathers of
ducks gilded by the sunlight. Memory of the day when Fleur was
born, and he had waited in such agony with her life and her
mother's balanced in his hands, came to him sharply. He had saved
her then, to be the flower of his life. And now! was she going to
give him trouble&mdash;pain&mdash;give him trouble? He did not like
the look of things! A blackbird broke in on his reverie with an
evening song&mdash;a great big fellow up in that acacia-tree.
Soames had taken quite an interest in his birds of late years; he
and Fleur would walk round and watch them; her eyes were sharp as
needles, and she knew every nest. He saw her dog, a retriever,
lying on the drive in a patch of sunlight, and called to him.
"Hallo, old fellow-waiting for her too!" The dog came slowly with a
grudging tail, and Soames mechanically laid a pat on his head. The
dog, the bird, the lilac, all were part of Fleur for him; no more,
no less. 'Too fond of her!' he thought, 'too fond!' He was like a
man uninsured, with his ships at sea. Uninsured again&mdash;as in
that other time, so long ago, when he would wander dumb and jealous
in the wilderness of London, longing for that woman&mdash;his first
wife&mdash;the mother of this infernal boy. Ah! There was the car
at last! It drew up, it had luggage, but no Fleur.</p>

<p>"Miss Fleur is walking up, sir, by the towing-path."</p>

<p>Walking all those miles? Soames stared. The man's face had the
beginning of a smile on it. What was he grinning at? And very
quickly he turned, saying, "All right, Sims!" and went into the
house. He mounted to the picture-gallery once more. He had from
there a view of the river bank, and stood with his eyes fixed on
it, oblivious of the fact that it would be an hour at least before
her figure showed there. Walking up! And that fellow's grin! The
boy&mdash;! He turned abruptly from the window. He couldn't spy on
her. If she wanted to keep things from him&mdash;she must; he could
not spy on her. His heart felt empty, and bitterness mounted from
it into his very mouth. The staccato shouts of Jack Cardigan
pursuing the ball, the laugh of young Mont rose in the stillness
and came in. He hoped they were making that chap Profond run. And
the girl in "La Vendimia" stood with her arm akimbo and her dreamy
eyes looking past him. 'I've done all I could for you,' he thought,
'since you were no higher than my knee. You aren't going
to&mdash;to&mdash;hurt me, are you?'</p>

<p>But the Goya copy answered not, brilliant in colour just
beginning to tone down. 'There's no real life in it,' thought
Soames. 'Why doesn't she come?'</p>

<h3>X.&mdash;TRIO</h3>

<p>Among those four Forsytes of the third, and, as one might say,
fourth generation, at Wansdon under the Downs, a week-end prolonged
unto the ninth day had stretched the crossing threads of tenacity
almost to snapping-point. Never had Fleur been so "fine," Holly so
watchful, Val so stable-secretive, Jon so silent and disturbed.
What he learned of farming in that week might have been balanced on
the point of a penknife and puffed off. He, whose nature was
essentially averse from intrigue, and whose adoration of Fleur
disposed him to think that any need for concealing it was
"skittles," chafed and fretted, yet obeyed, taking what relief he
could in the few moments when they were alone. On Thursday, while
they were standing in the bay window of the drawing-room, dressed
for dinner, she said to him:</p>

<p>"Jon, I'm going home on Sunday by the 3.40 from Paddington; if
you were to go home on Saturday you could come up on Sunday and
take me down, and just get back here by the last train, after. You
were going home anyway, weren't you?"</p>

<p>Jon nodded.</p>

<p>"Anything to be with you," he said; "only why need I
pretend&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fleur slipped her little finger into his palm:</p>

<p>"You have no instinct, Jon; you must leave things to me. It's
serious about our people. We've simply got to be secret at present,
if we want to be together." The door was opened, and she added
loudly: "You are a duffer, Jon."</p>

<p>Something turned over within Jon; he could not bear this
subterfuge about a feeling so natural, so overwhelming, and so
sweet.</p>

<p>On Friday night about eleven he had packed his bag, and was
leaning out of his window, half miserable, and half lost in a dream
of Paddington station, when he heard a tiny sound, as of a
finger-nail tapping on his door. He rushed to it and listened.
Again the sound. It was a nail. He opened. Oh! What a lovely thing
came in!</p>

<p>"I wanted to show you my fancy dress," it said, and struck an
attitude at the foot of his bed.</p>

<p>Jon drew a long breath and leaned against the door. The
apparition wore white muslin on its head, a fichu round its bare
neck over a wine-coloured dress, fulled out below its slender
waist.</p>

<p>It held one arm akimbo, and the other raised, right-angled,
holding a fan which touched its head.</p>

<p>"This ought to be a basket of grapes," it whispered, "but I
haven't got it here. It's my Goya dress. And this is the attitude
in the picture. Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"It's a dream."</p>

<p>The apparition pirouetted. "Touch it, and see."</p>

<p>Jon knelt down and took the skirt reverently.</p>

<p>"Grape colour," came the whisper, "all grapes&mdash;La
Vendimia&mdash;the vintage."</p>

<p>Jon's fingers scarcely touched each side of the waist; he looked
up, with adoring eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh! Jon," it whispered; bent, kissed his forehead, pirouetted
again, and, gliding out, was gone.</p>

<p>Jon stayed on his knees, and his head fell forward against the
bed. How long he stayed like that he did not know. The little
noises&mdash;of the tapping nail, the feet, the skirts
rustling&mdash;as in a dream&mdash;went on about him; and before
his closed eyes the figure stood and smiled and whispered, a faint
perfume of narcissus lingering in the air. And his forehead where
it had been kissed had a little cool place between the brows, like
the imprint of a flower. Love filled his soul, that love of boy for
girl which knows so little, hopes so much, would not brush the down
off for the world, and must become in time a fragrant
memory&mdash;a searing passion&mdash;a humdrum mateship&mdash;or,
once in many times, vintage full and sweet with sunset colour on
the grapes.</p>

<p>Enough has been said about Jon Forsyte here and in another place
to show what long marches lay between him and his
great-great-grandfather, the first Jolyon, in Dorset down by the
sea. Jon was sensitive as a girl, more sensitive than nine out of
ten girls of the day; imaginative as one of his half-sister June's
"lame duck" painters; affectionate as a son of his father and his
mother naturally would be. And yet, in his inner tissue, there was
something of the old founder of his family, a secret tenacity of
soul, a dread of showing his feelings, a determination not to know
when he was beaten. Sensitive, imaginative, affectionate boys get a
bad time at school, but Jon had instinctively kept his nature dark,
and been but normally unhappy there. Only with his mother had he,
up till then, been absolutely frank and natural; and when he went
home to Robin Hill that Saturday his heart was heavy because Fleur
had said that he must not be frank and natural with her from whom
he had never yet kept anything, must not even tell her that they
had met again, unless he found that she knew already. So
intolerable did this seem to him that he was very near to
telegraphing an excuse and staying up in London. And the first
thing his mother said to him was:</p>

<p>"So you've had our little friend of the confectioner's there,
Jon. What is she like on second thoughts?"</p>

<p>With relief, and a high colour, Jon answered:</p>

<p>"Oh! awfully jolly, Mum."</p>

<p>Her arm pressed his.</p>

<p>Jon had never loved her so much as in that minute which seemed
to falsify Fleur's fears and to release his soul. He turned to look
at her, but something in her smiling face&mdash;something which
only he perhaps would have caught&mdash;stopped the words bubbling
up in him. Could fear go with a smile? If so, there was fear in her
face. And out of Jon tumbled quite other words, about farming,
Holly, and the Downs. Talking fast, he waited for her to come back
to Fleur. But she did not. Nor did his father mention her, though
of course he, too, must know. What deprivation, and killing of
reality was in his silence about Fleur&mdash;when he was so full of
her; when his mother was so full of Jon, and his father so full of
his mother! And so the trio spent the evening of that Saturday.</p>

<p>After dinner his mother played; she seemed to play all the
things he liked best, and he sat with one knee clasped, and his
hair standing up where his fingers had run through it. He gazed at
his mother while she played, but he saw Fleur&mdash;Fleur in the
moonlit orchard, Fleur in the sunlit gravel-pit, Fleur in that
fancy dress, swaying, whispering, stooping, kissing his forehead.
Once, while he listened, he forgot himself and glanced at his
father in that other easy chair. What was Dad looking like that
for? The expression on his face was so sad and puzzling. It filled
him with a sort of remorse, so that he got up and went and sat on
the arm of his father's chair. From there he could not see his
face; and again he saw Fleur&mdash;in his mother's hands, slim and
white on the keys, in the profile of her face and her powdery hair;
and down the long room in the open window where the May night
walked outside.</p>

<p>When he went up to bed his mother came into his room. She stood
at the window, and said:</p>

<p>"Those cypresses your grandfather planted down there have done
wonderfully. I always think they look beautiful under a dropping
moon. I wish you had known your grandfather, Jon."</p>

<p>"Were you married to father when he was alive?" asked Jon
suddenly.</p>

<p>"No, dear; he died in '92&mdash;very old&mdash;eighty-five, I
think."</p>

<p>"Is Father like him?"</p>

<p>"A little, but more subtle, and not quite so solid."</p>

<p>"I know, from grandfather's portrait; who painted that?"</p>

<p>"One of June's 'lame ducks.' But it's quite good."</p>

<p>Jon slipped his hand through his mother's arm. "Tell me about
the family quarrel, Mum."</p>

<p>He felt her arm quivering. "No, dear; that's for your Father
some day, if he thinks fit."</p>

<p>"Then it was serious," said Jon, with a catch in his breath.</p>

<p>"Yes." And there was a silence, during which neither knew
whether the arm or the hand within it were quivering most.</p>

<p>"Some people," said Irene softly, "think the moon on her back is
evil; to me she's always lovely. Look at those cypress shadows!
Jon, Father says we may go to Italy, you and I, for two months.
Would you like?"</p>

<p>Jon took his hand from under her arm; his sensation was so sharp
and so confused. Italy with his mother! A fortnight ago it would
have been perfection; now it filled him with dismay; he felt that
the sudden suggestion had to do with Fleur. He stammered out:</p>

<p>"Oh! yes; only&mdash;I don't know. Ought I&mdash;now I've just
begun? I'd like to think it over."</p>

<p>Her voice answered, cool and gentle:</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; think it over. But better now than when you've begun
farming seriously. Italy with you! It would be nice!"</p>

<p>Jon put his arm round her waist, still slim and firm as a
girl's.</p>

<p>"Do you think you ought to leave Father?" he said feebly,
feeling very mean.</p>

<p>"Father suggested it; he thinks you ought to see Italy at least
before you settle down to anything."</p>

<p>The sense of meanness died in Jon; he knew, yes&mdash;he
knew&mdash;that his father and his mother were not speaking
frankly, no more than he himself. They wanted to keep him from
Fleur. His heart hardened. And, as if she felt that process going
on, his mother said:</p>

<p>"Good-night, darling. Have a good sleep and think it over. But
it would be lovely!"</p>

<p>She pressed him to her so quickly that he did not see her face.
Jon stood feeling exactly as he used to when he was a naughty
little boy; sore because he was not loving, and because he was
justified in his own eyes.</p>

<p>But Irene, after she had stood a moment in her own room, passed
through the dressing-room between it and her husband's.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"He will think it over, Jolyon."</p>

<p>Watching her lips that wore a little drawn smile, Jolyon said
quietly:</p>

<p>"You had better let me tell him, and have done with it. After
all, Jon has the instincts of a gentleman. He has only to
understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only! He can't understand; that's impossible."</p>

<p>"I believe I could have at his age."</p>

<p>Irene caught his hand. "You were always more of a realist than
Jon; and never so innocent."</p>

<p>"That's true," said Jolyon. "It's queer, isn't it? You and I
would tell our stories to the world without a particle of shame;
but our own boy stumps us."</p>

<p>"We've never cared whether the world approves or not."</p>

<p>"Jon would not disapprove of us!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Jolyon, yes. He's in love, I feel he's in love. And he'd
say: 'My mother once married without love! How could she have!'
It'll seem to him a crime! And so it was!"</p>

<p>Jolyon took her hand, and said with a wry smile:</p>

<p>"Ah! why on earth are we born young? Now, if only we were born
old and grew younger year by year, we should understand how things
happen, and drop all our cursed intolerance. But you know if the
boy is really in love, he won't forget, even if he goes to Italy.
We're a tenacious breed; and he'll know by instinct why he's being
sent. Nothing will really cure him but the shock of being
told."</p>

<p>"Let me try, anyway."</p>

<p>Jolyon stood a moment without speaking. Between this devil and
this deep sea&mdash;the pain of a dreaded disclosure and the grief
of losing his wife for two months&mdash;he secretly hoped for the
devil; yet if she wished for the deep sea he must put up with it.
After all, it would be training for that departure from which there
would be no return. And, taking her in his arms, he kissed her
eyes, and said:</p>

<p>"As you will, my love."</p>

<hr>

<h3>XI.&mdash;DUET</h3>

<p>That "small" emotion, love, grows amazingly when threatened with
extinction. Jon reached Paddington station half an hour before his
time and a full week after, as it seemed to him. He stood at the
appointed bookstall, amid a crowd of Sunday travellers, in a Harris
tweed suit exhaling, as it were, the emotion of his thumping heart.
He read the names of the novels on the book-stall, and bought one
at last, to avoid being regarded with suspicion by the book-stall
clerk. It was called "The Heart of the Trail!" which must mean
something, though it did not seem to. He also bought "The Lady's
Mirror" and "The Landsman." Every minute was an hour long, and full
of horrid imaginings. After nineteen had passed, he saw her with a
bag and a porter wheeling her luggage. She came swiftly; she came
cool. She greeted him as if he were a brother.</p>

<p>"First class," she said to the porter, "corner seats;
opposite."</p>

<p>Jon admired her frightful self-possession.</p>

<p>"Can't we get a carriage to ourselves," he whispered.</p>

<p>"No good; it's a stopping train. After Maidenhead perhaps. Look
natural, Jon."</p>

<p>Jon screwed his features into a scowl. They got in&mdash;with
two other beasts!&mdash;oh! heaven! He tipped the porter
unnaturally, in his confusion. The brute deserved nothing for
putting them in there, and looking as if he knew all about it into
the bargain.</p>

<p>Fleur hid herself behind "The Lady's Mirror." Jon imitated her
behind "The Landsman." The train started. Fleur let "The Lady's
Mirror" fall and leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said.</p>

<p>"It's seemed about fifteen days."</p>

<p>She nodded, and Jon's face lighted up at once.</p>

<p>"Look natural," murmured Fleur, and went off into a bubble of
laughter. It hurt him. How could he look natural with Italy hanging
over him? He had meant to break it to her gently, but now he
blurted it out.</p>

<p>"They want me to go to Italy with Mother for two months."</p>

<p>Fleur drooped her eyelids; turned a little pale, and bit her
lips. "Oh!" she said. It was all, but it was much.</p>

<p>That "Oh!" was like the quick drawback of the wrist in fencing
ready for riposte. It came.</p>

<p>"You must go!"</p>

<p>"Go?" said Jon in a strangled voice.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;two months&mdash;it's ghastly."</p>

<p>"No," said Fleur, "six weeks. You'll have forgotten me by then.
We'll meet in the National Gallery the day after you get back."</p>

<p>Jon laughed.</p>

<p>"But suppose you've forgotten me," he muttered into the noise of
the train.</p>

<p>Fleur shook her head.</p>

<p>"Some other beast&mdash;" murmured Jon.</p>

<p>Her foot touched his.</p>

<p>"No other beast," she said, lifting "The Lady's Mirror."</p>

<p>The train stopped; two passengers got out, and one got in.</p>

<p>'I shall die,' thought Jon, 'if we're not alone at all.'</p>

<p>The train went on; and again Fleur leaned forward.</p>

<p>"I never let go," she said; "do you?"</p>

<p>Jon shook his head vehemently.</p>

<p>"Never!" he said. "Will you write to me?"</p>

<p>"No; but you can&mdash;to my Club."</p>

<p>She had a Club; she was wonderful!</p>

<p>"Did you pump Holly?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I got nothing. I didn't dare pump hard."</p>

<p>"What can it be?" cried Jon.</p>

<p>"I shall find out all right."</p>

<p>A long silence followed till Fleur said: "This is Maidenhead;
stand by, Jon!"</p>

<p>The train stopped. The remaining passenger got out. Fleur drew
down her blind.</p>

<p>"Quick!" she cried. "Hang out! Look as much of a beast as you
can."</p>

<p>Jon blew his nose, and scowled; never in all his life had he
scowled like that! An old lady recoiled, a young one tried the
handle. It turned, but the door would not open. The train moved,
the young lady darted to another carriage.</p>

<p>"What luck!" cried Jon. "It Jammed."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fleur; "I was holding it."</p>

<p>The train moved out, and Jon fell on his knees.</p>

<p>"Look out for the corridor," she whispered;
"and&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>Her lips met his. And though their kiss only lasted perhaps ten
seconds, Jon's soul left his body and went so far beyond, that,
when he was again sitting opposite that demure figure, he was pale
as death. He heard her sigh, and the sound seemed to him the most
precious he had ever heard&mdash;an exquisite declaration that he
meant something to her.</p>

<p>"Six weeks isn't really long," she said; "and you can easily
make it six if you keep your head out there, and never seem to
think of me."</p>

<p>Jon gasped.</p>

<p>"This is just what's really wanted, Jon, to convince them, don't
you see? If we're just as bad when you come back they'll stop being
ridiculous about it. Only, I'm sorry it's not Spain; there's a girl
in a Goya picture at Madrid who's like me, Father says. Only she
isn't&mdash;we've got a copy of her."</p>

<p>It was to Jon like a ray of sunshine piercing through a fog.
"I'll make it Spain," he said, "Mother won't mind; she's never been
there. And my Father thinks a lot of Goya."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, he's a painter&mdash;isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Only water-colour," said Jon, with honesty.</p>

<p>"When we come to Reading, Jon, get out first and go down to
Caversham lock and wait for me. I'll send the car home and we'll
walk by the towing-path."</p>

<p>Jon seized her hand in gratitude, and they sat silent, with the
world well lost, and one eye on the corridor. But the train seemed
to run twice as fast now, and its sound was almost lost in that of
Jon's sighing.</p>

<p>"We're getting near," said Fleur; "the towing-path's awfully
exposed. One more! Oh! Jon, don't forget me."</p>

<p>Jon answered with his kiss. And very soon, a flushed,
distracted-looking youth could have been seen&mdash;as they
say&mdash;leaping from the train and hurrying along the platform,
searching his pockets for his ticket.</p>

<p>When at last she rejoined him on the towing-path a little beyond
Caversham lock he had made an effort, and regained some measure of
equanimity. If they had to part, he would not make a scene! A
breeze by the bright river threw the white side of the willow
leaves up into the sunlight, and followed those two with its faint
rustle.</p>

<p>"I told our chauffeur that I was train-giddy," said Fleur. "Did
you look pretty natural as you went out?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. What is natural?"</p>

<p>"It's natural to you to look seriously happy. When I first saw
you I thought you weren't a bit like other people."</p>

<p>"Exactly what I thought when I saw you. I knew at once I should
never love anybody else."</p>

<p>Fleur laughed.</p>

<p>"We're absurdly young. And love's young dream is out of date,
Jon. Besides, it's awfully wasteful. Think of all the fun you might
have. You haven't begun, even; it's a shame, really. And there's
me. I wonder!"</p>

<p>Confusion came on Jon's spirit. How could she say such things
just as they were going to part?</p>

<p>"If you feel like that," he said, "I can't go. I shall tell
Mother that I ought to try and work. There's always the condition
of the world!"</p>

<p>"The condition of the world!"</p>

<p>Jon thrust his hands deep into his pockets.</p>

<p>"But there is," he said; "think of the people starving!"</p>

<p>Fleur shook her head. "No, no, I never, never will make myself
miserable for nothing."</p>

<p>"Nothing! But there's an awful state of things, and of course
one ought to help."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, I know all that. But you can't help people, Jon;
they're hopeless. When you pull them out they only get into another
hole. Look at them, still fighting and plotting and struggling,
though they're dying in heaps all the time. Idiots!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you sorry for them?"</p>

<p>"Oh! sorry&mdash;yes, but I'm not going to make myself unhappy
about it; that's no good."</p>

<p>And they were silent, disturbed by this first glimpse of each
other's natures.</p>

<p>"I think people are brutes and idiots," said Fleur
stubbornly.</p>

<p>"I think they're poor wretches," said Jon. It was as if they had
quarrelled&mdash;and at this supreme and awful moment, with parting
visible out there in that last gap of the willows!</p>

<p>"Well, go and help your poor wretches, and don't think of
me."</p>

<p>Jon stood still. Sweat broke out on his forehead, and his limbs
trembled. Fleur too had stopped, and was frowning at the river.</p>

<p>"I must believe in things," said Jon with a sort of agony;
"we're all meant to enjoy life."</p>

<p>Fleur laughed. "Yes; and that's what you won't do, if you don't
take care. But perhaps your idea of enjoyment is to make yourself
wretched. There are lots of people like that, of course."</p>

<p>She was pale, her eyes had darkened, her lips had thinned. Was
it Fleur thus staring at the water? Jon had an unreal feeling as if
he were passing through the scene in a book where the lover has to
choose between love and duty. But just then she looked round at
him. Never was anything so intoxicating as that vivacious look. It
acted on him exactly as the tug of a chain acts on a
dog&mdash;brought him up to her with his tail wagging and his
tongue out.</p>

<p>"Don't let's be silly," she said, "time's too short. Look, Jon,
you can just see where I've got to cross the river. There, round
the bend, where the woods begin."</p>

<p>Jon saw a gable, a chimney or two, a patch of wall through the
trees&mdash;and felt his heart sink.</p>

<p>"I mustn't dawdle any more. It's no good going beyond the next
hedge, it gets all open. Let's get on to it and say good-bye."</p>

<p>They went side by side, hand in hand, silently toward the hedge,
where the may-flower, both pink and white, was in full bloom.</p>

<p>"My Club's the 'Talisman,' Stratton Street, Piccadilly. Letters
there will be quite safe, and I'm almost always up once a
week."</p>

<p>Jon nodded. His face had become extremely set, his eyes stared
straight before him.</p>

<p>"To-day's the twenty-third of May," said Fleur; "on the ninth of
July I shall be in front of the 'Bacchus and Ariadne' at three
o'clock; will you?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"If you feel as bad as I it's all right. Let those people
pass!"</p>

<p>A man and woman airing their children went by strung out in
Sunday fashion.</p>

<p>The last of them passed the wicket gate.</p>

<p>"Domesticity!" said Fleur, and blotted herself against the
hawthorn hedge. The blossom sprayed out above her head, and one
pink cluster brushed her cheek. Jon put up his hand jealously to
keep it off.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Jon." For a second they stood with hands hard
clasped. Then their lips met for the third time, and when they
parted Fleur broke away and fled through the wicket gate. Jon stood
where she had left him, with his forehead against that pink
cluster. Gone! For an eternity&mdash;for seven weeks all but two
days! And here he was, wasting the last sight of her! He rushed to
the gate. She was walking swiftly on the heels of the straggling
children. She turned her head, he saw her hand make a little
flitting gesture; then she sped on, and the trailing family blotted
her out from his view.</p>

<p>The words of a comic song&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Paddington groan-worst ever known<br>
He gave a sepulchral Paddington groan&mdash;"</blockquote>

<p>came into his head, and he sped incontinently back to Reading
station. All the way up to London and down to Wansdon he sat with
"The Heart of the Trail" open on his knee, knitting in his head a
poem so full of feeling that it would not rhyme.</p>

<hr>

<h3>XII.&mdash;CAPRICE</h3>

<p>Fleur sped on. She had need of rapid motion; she was late, and
wanted all her wits about her when she got in. She passed the
islands, the station, and hotel, and was about to take the ferry,
when she saw a skiff with a young man standing up in it, and
holding to the bushes.</p>

<p>"Miss Forsyte," he said; "let me put you across. I've come on
purpose."</p>

<p>She looked at him in blank amazement.</p>

<p>"It's all right, I've been having tea with your people. I
thought I'd save you the last bit. It's on my way, I'm just off
back to Pangbourne. My name's Mont. I saw you at the
picture-gallery&mdash;you remember&mdash;when your father invited
me to see his pictures."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Fleur; "yes&mdash;the handkerchief."</p>

<p>To this young man she owed Jon; and, taking his hand, she
stepped down into the skiff. Still emotional, and a little out of
breath, she sat silent; not so the young man. She had never heard
any one say so much in so short a time. He told her his age,
twenty-four; his weight, ten stone eleven; his place of residence,
not far away; described his sensations under fire, and what it felt
like to be gassed; criticized the Juno, mentioned his own
conception of that goddess; commented on the Goya copy, said Fleur
was not too awfully like it; sketched in rapidly the condition of
England; spoke of Monsieur Profond&mdash;or whatever his name
was&mdash;as "an awful sport"; thought her father had some
"ripping" pictures and some rather "dug-up"; hoped he might row
down again and take her on the river because he was quite
trustworthy; inquired her opinion of Tchekov, gave her his own;
wished they could go to the Russian ballet together some
time&mdash;considered the name Fleur Forsyte simply topping; cursed
his people for giving him the name of Michael on the top of Mont;
outlined his father, and said that if she wanted a good book she
should read "Job"; his father was rather like Job while Job still
had land.</p>

<p>"But Job didn't have land," Fleur murmured; "he only had flocks
and herds and moved on."</p>

<p>"Ah!" answered Michael Mont, "I wish my gov'nor would move on.
Not that I want his land. Land's an awful bore in these days, don't
you think?"</p>

<p>"We never have it in my family," said Fleur. "We have everything
else. I believe one of my great-uncles once had a sentimental farm
in Dorset, because we came from there originally, but it cost him
more than it made him happy."</p>

<p>"Did he sell it?"</p>

<p>"No; he kept it."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because nobody would buy it."</p>

<p>"Good for the old boy!"</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't good for him. Father says it soured him. His name
was Swithin."</p>

<p>"What a corking name!"</p>

<p>"Do you know that we're getting farther off, not nearer? This
river flows."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" cried Mont, dipping his sculls vaguely; "it's good
to meet a girl who's got wit."</p>

<p>"But better to meet a young man who's got it in the plural."</p>

<p>Young Mont raised a hand to tear his hair.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried Fleur. "Your scull!"</p>

<p>"All right! It's thick enough to bear a scratch."</p>

<p>"Do you mind sculling?" said Fleur severely. "I want to get
in."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mont; "but when you get in, you see, I shan't see you
any more to-day. Fini, as the French girl said when she jumped on
her bed after saying her prayers. Don't you bless the day that gave
you a French mother, and a name like yours?"</p>

<p>"I like my name, but Father gave it me. Mother wanted me called
Marguerite."</p>

<p>"Which is absurd. Do you mind calling me M. M. and letting me
call you F. F.? It's in the spirit of the age."</p>

<p>"I don't mind anything, so long as I get in."</p>

<p>Mont caught a little crab, and answered: "That was a nasty
one!"</p>

<p>"Please row."</p>

<p>"I am." And he did for several strokes, looking at her with
rueful eagerness. "Of course, you know," he ejaculated, pausing,
"that I came to see you, not your father's pictures."</p>

<p>Fleur rose.</p>

<p>"If you don't row, I shall get out and swim."</p>

<p>"Really and truly? Then I could come in after you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Mont, I'm late and tired; please put me on shore at
once."</p>

<p>When she stepped out on to the garden landing-stage he rose, and
grasping his hair with both hands, looked at her.</p>

<p>Fleur smiled.</p>

<p>"Don't!" cried the irrepressible Mont. "I know you're going to
say: 'Out, damned hair!'"</p>

<p>Fleur whisked round, threw him a wave of her hand. "Good-bye,
Mr. M.M.!" she called, and was gone among the rose-trees. She
looked at her wrist-watch and the windows of the house. It struck
her as curiously uninhabited. Past six! The pigeons were just
gathering to roost, and sunlight slanted on the dovecot, on their
snowy feathers, and beyond in a shower on the top boughs of the
woods. The click of billiard-balls came from the
ingle-nook&mdash;Jack Cardigan, no doubt; a faint rustling, too,
from an eucalyptus-tree, startling Southerner in this old English
garden. She reached the verandah and was passing in, but stopped at
the sound of voices from the drawing-room to her left. Mother!
Monsieur Profond! From behind the verandah screen which fenced the
ingle-nook she heard these words:</p>

<p>"I don't, Annette."</p>

<p>Did Father know that he called her mother "Annette"? Always on
the side of her Father&mdash;as children are ever on one side or
the other in houses where relations are a little strained&mdash;she
stood, uncertain. Her mother was speaking in her low, pleasing,
slightly metallic voice&mdash;one word she caught: "Demain." And
Profond's answer: "All right." Fleur frowned. A little sound came
out into the stillness. Then Profond's voice: "I'm takin' a small
stroll."</p>

<p>Fleur darted through the window into the morning-room. There he
came from the drawing-room, crossing the verandah, down the lawn;
and the click of billiard-balls which, in listening for other
sounds, she had ceased to hear, began again. She shook herself,
passed into the hall, and opened the drawing-room door. Her mother
was sitting on the sofa between the windows, her knees crossed, her
head resting on a cushion, her lips half parted, her eyes half
closed. She looked extraordinarily handsome.</p>

<p>"Ah! Here you are, Fleur! Your father is beginning to fuss."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"In the picture-gallery. Go up!"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do to-morrow, Mother?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow? I go up to London with your aunt."</p>

<p>"I thought you might be. Will you get me a quite plain
parasol?"</p>

<p>"What colour?"</p>

<p>"Green. They're all going back, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, all; you will console your father. Kiss me, then."</p>

<p>Fleur crossed the room, stooped, received a kiss on her
forehead, and went out past the impress of a form on the
sofa-cushions in the other corner. She ran up-stairs.</p>

<p>Fleur was by no means the old-fashioned daughter who demands the
regulation of her parents' lives in accordance with the standard
imposed upon herself. She claimed to regulate her own life, not
those of others; besides, an unerring instinct for what was likely
to advantage her own case was already at work. In a disturbed
domestic atmosphere the heart she had set on Jon would have a
better chance. None the less was she offended, as a flower by a
crisping wind. If that man had really been kissing her mother it
was&mdash;serious, and her father ought to know. "Demain!" "All
right!" And her mother going up to Town! She turned into her
bedroom and hung out of the window to cool her face, which had
suddenly grown very hot. Jon must be at the station by now! What
did her father know about Jon? Probably everything&mdash;pretty
nearly!</p>

<p>She changed her dress, so as to look as if she had been in some
time, and ran up to the gallery.</p>

<p>Soames was standing stubbornly still before his Alfred
Stevens&mdash;the picture he loved best. He did not turn at the
sound of the door, but she knew he had heard, and she knew he was
hurt. She came up softly behind him, put her arms round his neck,
and poked her face over his shoulder till her cheek lay against
his. It was an advance which had never yet failed, but it failed
her now, and she augured the worst. "Well," he said stonily, "so
you've come!"</p>

<p>"Is that all," murmured Fleur, "from a bad parent?" And she
rubbed her cheek against his.</p>

<p>Soames shook his head so far as that was possible.</p>

<p>"Why do you keep me on tenterhooks like this, putting me off and
off?"</p>

<p>"Darling, it was very harmless."</p>

<p>"Harmless! Much you know what's harmless and what isn't."</p>

<p>Fleur dropped her arms.</p>

<p>"Well, then, dear, suppose you tell me; and be quite frank about
it."</p>

<p>And she went over to the window-seat.</p>

<p>Her father had turned from his picture, and was staring at his
feet. He looked very grey. 'He has nice small feet,' she thought,
catching his eye, at once averted from her.</p>

<p>"You're my only comfort," said Soames suddenly, "and you go on
like this."</p>

<p>Fleur's heart began to beat.</p>

<p>"Like what, dear?"</p>

<p>Again Soames gave her a look which, but for the affection in it,
might have been called furtive.</p>

<p>"You know what I told you," he said. "I don't choose to have
anything to do with that branch of our family."</p>

<p>"Yes, ducky, but I don't know why I shouldn't."</p>

<p>Soames turned on his heel.</p>

<p>"I'm not going into the reasons," he said; "you ought to trust
me, Fleur!"</p>

<p>The way he spoke those words affected Fleur, but she thought of
Jon, and was silent, tapping her foot against the wainscot.
Unconsciously she had assumed a modern attitude, with one leg
twisted in and out of the other, with her chin on one bent wrist,
her other arm across her chest, and its hand hugging her elbow;
there was not a line of her that was not involuted, and
yet&mdash;in spite of all&mdash;she retained a certain grace.</p>

<p>"You knew my wishes," Soames went on, "and yet you stayed on
there four days. And I suppose that boy came with you to-day."</p>

<p>Fleur kept her eyes on him.</p>

<p>"I don't ask you anything," said Soames; "I make no inquisition
where you're concerned."</p>

<p>Fleur suddenly stood up, leaning out at the window with her chin
on her hands. The sun had sunk behind trees, the pigeons were
perched, quite still, on the edge of the dove-cot; the click of the
billiard-balls mounted, and a faint radiance shone out below where
Jack Cardigan had turned the light up.</p>

<p>"Will it make you any happier," she said suddenly, "if I promise
you not to see him for say&mdash;the next six weeks?" She was not
prepared for a sort of tremble in the blankness of his voice.</p>

<p>"Six weeks? Six years&mdash;sixty years more like. Don't delude
yourself, Fleur; don't delude yourself!"</p>

<p>Fleur turned in alarm.</p>

<p>"Father, what is it?"</p>

<p>Soames came close enough to see her face.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me," he said, "that you're foolish enough to have
any feeling beyond caprice. That would be too much!" And he
laughed.</p>

<p>Fleur, who had never heard him laugh like that, thought: 'Then
it is deep! Oh! what is it?' And putting her hand through his arm
she said lightly:</p>

<p>"No, of course; caprice. Only, I like my caprices and I don't
like yours, dear."</p>

<p>"Mine!" said Soames bitterly, and turned away.</p>

<p>The light outside had chilled, and threw a chalky whiteness on
the river. The trees had lost all gaiety of colour. She felt a
sudden hunger for Jon's face, for his hands, and the feel of his
lips again on hers. And pressing her arms tight across her breast
she forced out a little light laugh.</p>

<p>"O la! la! What a small fuss! as Profond would say. Father, I
don't like that man."</p>

<p>She saw him stop, and take something out of his breast
pocket.</p>

<p>"You don't?" he said. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," murmured Fleur; "just caprice!"</p>

<p>"No," said Soames; "not caprice!" And he tore what was in his
hands across. "You're right. I don't like him either!"</p>

<p>"Look!" said Fleur softly. "There he goes! I hate his shoes;
they don't make any noise."</p>

<p>Down in the failing light Prosper Profond moved, his hands in
his side pockets, whistling softly in his beard; he stopped, and
glanced up at the sky, as if saying: "I don't think much of that
small moon."</p>

<p>Fleur drew back. "Isn't he a great cat?" she whispered; and the
sharp click of the billiard-balls rose, as if Jack Cardigan had
capped the cat, the moon, caprice, and tragedy with: "In off the
red!"</p>

<p>Monsieur Profond had resumed his stroll, to a teasing little
tune in his beard. What was it? Oh! yes, from "Rigoletto": "Donna a
mobile." Just what he would think! She squeezed her father's
arm.</p>

<p>"Prowling!" she muttered, as he turned the corner of the house.
It was past that disillusioned moment which divides the day and
night-still and lingering and warm, with hawthorn scent and lilac
scent clinging on the riverside air. A blackbird suddenly burst
out. Jon would be in London by now; in the Park perhaps, crossing
the Serpentine, thinking of her! A little sound beside her made her
turn her eyes; her father was again tearing the paper in his hands.
Fleur saw it was a cheque.</p>

<p>"I shan't sell him my Gauguin," he said. "I don't know what your
aunt and Imogen see in him."</p>

<p>"Or Mother."</p>

<p>"Your mother!" said Soames.</p>

<p>'Poor Father!' she thought. 'He never looks happy&mdash;not
really happy. I don't want to make him worse, but of course I shall
have to, when Jon comes back. Oh! well, sufficient unto the
night!'</p>

<p>"I'm going to dress," she said.</p>

<p>In her room she had a fancy to put on her "freak" dress. It was
of gold tissue with little trousers of the same, tightly drawn in
at the ankles, a page's cape slung from the shoulders, little gold
shoes, and a gold-winged Mercury helmet; and all over her were tiny
gold bells, especially on the helmet; so that if she shook her head
she pealed. When she was dressed she felt quite sick because Jon
could not see her; it even seemed a pity that the sprightly young
man Michael Mont would not have a view. But the gong had sounded,
and she went down.</p>

<p>She made a sensation in the drawing-room. Winifred thought it
"Most amusing." Imogen was enraptured. Jack Cardigan called it
"stunning," "ripping," "topping," and "corking."</p>

<p>Monsieur Profond, smiling with his eyes, said: "That's a nice
small dress!" Her mother, very handsome in black, sat looking at
her, and said nothing. It remained for her father to apply the test
of common sense. "What did you put on that thing for? You're not
going to dance."</p>

<p>Fleur spun round, and the bells pealed.</p>

<p>"Caprice!"</p>

<p>Soames stared at her, and, turning away, gave his arm to
Winifred. Jack Cardigan took her mother. Prosper Profond took
Imogen. Fleur went in by herself, with her bells jingling...</p>

<p>The "small" moon had soon dropped down, and May night had fallen
soft and warm, enwrapping with its grape-bloom colour and its
scents the billion caprices, intrigues, passions, longings, and
regrets of men and women. Happy was Jack Cardigan who snored into
Imogen's white shoulder, fit as a flea; or Timothy in his
"mausoleum," too old for anything but baby's slumber. For so many
lay awake, or dreamed, teased by the criss-cross of the world.</p>

<p>The dew fell and the flowers closed; cattle grazed on in the
river meadows, feeling with their tongues for the grass they could
not see; and the sheep on the Downs lay quiet as stones. Pheasants
in the tall trees of the Pangbourne woods, larks on their grassy
nests above the gravel-pit at Wansdon, swallows in the eaves at
Robin Hill, and the sparrows of Mayfair, all made a dreamless night
of it, soothed by the lack of wind. The Mayfly filly, hardly
accustomed to her new quarters, scraped at her straw a little; and
the few night-flitting things&mdash;bats, moths, owls&mdash;were
vigorous in the warm darkness; but the peace of night lay in the
brain of all day-time Nature, colourless and still. Men and women,
alone, riding the hobby-horses of anxiety or love, burned their
wavering tapers of dream and thought into the lonely hours.</p>

<p>Fleur, leaning out of her window, heard the hall clock's muffled
chime of twelve, the tiny splash of a fish, the sudden shaking of
an aspen's leaves in the puffs of breeze that rose along the river,
the distant rumble of a night train, and time and again the sounds
which none can put a name to in the darkness, soft obscure
expressions of uncatalogued emotions from man and beast, bird and
machine, or, maybe, from departed Forsytes, Darties, Cardigans,
taking night strolls back into a world which had once suited their
embodied spirits. But Fleur heeded not these sounds; her spirit,
far from disembodied, fled with swift wing from railway-carriage to
flowery hedge, straining after Jon, tenacious of his forbidden
image, and the sound of his voice, which was taboo. And she
crinkled her nose, retrieving from the perfume of the riverside
night that moment when his hand slipped between the mayflowers and
her cheek. Long she leaned out in her freak dress, keen to burn her
wings at life's candle; while the moths brushed her cheeks on their
pilgrimage to the lamp on her dressing-table, ignorant that in a
Forsyte's house there is no open flame. But at last even she felt
sleepy, and, forgetting her bells, drew quickly in.</p>

<p>Through the open window of his room, alongside Annette's,
Soames, wakeful too, heard their thin faint tinkle, as it might be
shaken from stars, or the dewdrops falling from a flower, if one
could hear such sounds.</p>

<p>'Caprice!' he thought. 'I can't tell. She's wilful. What shall I
do? Fleur!'</p>

<p>And long into the "small" night he brooded.</p>

<hr>

<h3>PART II</h3>

<hr>

<h3>I.&mdash;MOTHER AND SON</h3>

<p>To say that Jon Forsyte accompanied his mother to Spain
unwillingly would scarcely have been adequate. He went as a
well-natured dog goes for a walk with its mistress, leaving a
choice mutton-bone on the lawn. He went looking back at it.
Forsytes deprived of their mutton-bones are wont to sulk. But Jon
had little sulkiness in his composition. He adored his mother, and
it was his first travel. Spain had become Italy by his simply
saying: "I'd rather go to Spain, Mum; you've been to Italy so many
times; I'd like it new to both of us."</p>

<p>The fellow was subtle besides being naive. He never forgot that
he was going to shorten the proposed two months into six weeks, and
must therefore show no sign of wishing to do so. For one with so
enticing a mutton-bone and so fixed an idea, he made a good enough
travelling companion, indifferent to where or when he arrived,
superior to food, and thoroughly appreciative of a country strange
to the most travelled Englishman. Fleur's wisdom in refusing to
write to him was profound, for he reached each new place entirely
without hope or fever, and could concentrate immediate attention on
the donkeys and tumbling bells, the priests, patios, beggars,
children, crowing cocks, sombreros, cactus-hedges, old high white
villages, goats, olive-trees, greening plains, singing birds in
tiny cages, watersellers, sunsets, melons, mules, great churches,
pictures, and swimming grey-brown mountains of a fascinating
land.</p>

<p>It was already hot, and they enjoyed an absence of their
compatriots. Jon, who, so far as he knew, had no blood in him which
was not English, was often innately unhappy in the presence of his
own countrymen. He felt they had no nonsense about them, and took a
more practical view of things than himself. He confided to his
mother that he must be an unsociable beast&mdash;it was jolly to be
away from everybody who could talk about the things people did talk
about. To which Irene had replied simply:</p>

<p>"Yes, Jon, I know."</p>

<p>In this isolation he had unparalleled opportunities of
appreciating what few sons can apprehend, the whole-heartedness of
a mother's love. Knowledge of something kept from her made him, no
doubt, unduly sensitive; and a Southern people stimulated his
admiration for her type of beauty, which he had been accustomed to
hear called Spanish, but which he now perceived to be no such
thing. Her beauty was neither English, French, Spanish, nor
Italian&mdash;it was special! He appreciated, too, as never before,
his mother's subtlety of instinct. He could not tell, for instance,
whether she had noticed his absorption in that Goya picture, "La
Vendimia," or whether she knew that he had slipped back there after
lunch and again next morning, to stand before it full half an hour,
a second and third time. It was not Fleur, of course, but like
enough to give him heartache&mdash;so dear to
lovers&mdash;remembering her standing at the foot of his bed with
her hand held above her head. To keep a postcard reproduction of
this picture in his pocket and slip it out to look at became for
Jon one of those bad habits which soon or late disclose themselves
to eyes sharpened by love, fear, or jealousy. And his mother's were
sharpened by all three. In Granada he was fairly caught, sitting on
a sun-warmed stone bench in a little battlemented garden on the
Alhambra hill, whence he ought to have been looking at the view.
His mother, he had thought, was examining the potted stocks between
the polled acacias, when her voice said:</p>

<p>"Is that your favourite Goya, Jon?"</p>

<p>He checked, too late, a movement such as he might have made at
school to conceal some surreptitious document, and answered:
"Yes."</p>

<p>"It certainly is most charming; but I think I prefer the
'Quitasol' Your father would go crazy about Goya; I don't believe
he saw them when he was in Spain in '92."</p>

<p>In '92&mdash;nine years before he had been born! What had been
the previous existences of his father and his mother? If they had a
right to share in his future, surely he had a right to share in
their pasts. He looked up at her. But something in her face&mdash;a
look of life hard-lived, the mysterious impress of emotions,
experience, and suffering-seemed, with its incalculable depth, its
purchased sanctity, to make curiosity impertinent. His mother must
have had a wonderfully interesting life; she was so beautiful, and
so&mdash;so&mdash;but he could not frame what he felt about her. He
got up, and stood gazing down at the town, at the plain all green
with crops, and the ring of mountains glamorous in sinking
sunlight. Her life was like the past of this old Moorish city,
full, deep, remote&mdash;his own life as yet such a baby of a
thing, hopelessly ignorant and innocent! They said that in those
mountains to the West, which rose sheer from the blue-green plain,
as if out of a sea, Phoenicians had dwelt&mdash;a dark, strange,
secret race, above the land! His mother's life was as unknown to
him, as secret, as that Phoenician past was to the town down there,
whose cocks crowed and whose children played and clamoured so
gaily, day in, day out. He felt aggrieved that she should know all
about him and he nothing about her except that she loved him and
his father, and was beautiful. His callow ignorance&mdash;he had
not even had the advantage of the War, like nearly everybody
else!&mdash;made him small in his own eyes.</p>

<p>That night, from the balcony of his bedroom, he gazed down on
the roof of the town&mdash;as if inlaid with honeycomb of jet,
ivory, and gold; and, long after, he lay awake, listening to the
cry of the sentry as the hours struck, and forming in his head
these lines:</p>

<blockquote>"Voice in the night crying, down in the old
sleeping<br>
Spanish city darkened under her white stars!<br>
<br>
"What says the voice-its clear-lingering anguish?<br>
Just the watchman, telling his dateless tale of safety?<br>
Just a road-man, flinging to the moon his song?<br>
<br>
"No! Tis one deprived, whose lover's heart is weeping,<br>
Just his cry: 'How long?'"</blockquote>

<p>The word "deprived" seemed to him cold and unsatisfactory, but
"bereaved" was too final, and no other word of two syllables
short-long came to him, which would enable him to keep "whose
lover's heart is weeping." It was past two by the time he had
finished it, and past three before he went to sleep, having said it
over to himself at least twenty-four times. Next day he wrote it
out and enclosed it in one of those letters to Fleur which he
always finished before he went down, so as to have his mind free
and companionable.</p>

<p>About noon that same day, on the tiled terrace of their hotel,
he felt a sudden dull pain in the back of his head, a queer
sensation in the eyes, and sickness. The sun had touched him too
affectionately. The next three days were passed in semi-darkness,
and a dulled, aching indifference to all except the feel of ice on
his forehead and his mother's smile. She never moved from his room,
never relaxed her noiseless vigilance, which seemed to Jon angelic.
But there were moments when he was extremely sorry for himself, and
wished terribly that Fleur could see him. Several times he took a
poignant imaginary leave of her and of the earth, tears oozing out
of his eyes. He even prepared the message he would send to her by
his mother&mdash;who would regret to her dying day that she had
ever sought to separate them&mdash;his poor mother! He was not
slow, however, in perceiving that he had now his excuse for going
home.</p>

<p>Toward half-past six each evening came a "gasgacha" of
bells&mdash;a cascade of tumbling chimes, mounting from the city
below and falling back chime on chime. After listening to them on
the fourth day he said suddenly:</p>

<p>"I'd like to be back in England, Mum, the sun's too hot."</p>

<p>"Very well, darling. As soon as you're fit to travel" And at
once he felt better, and&mdash;meaner.</p>

<p>They had been out five weeks when they turned toward home. Jon's
head was restored to its pristine clarity, but he was confined to a
hat lined by his mother with many layers of orange and green silk
and he still walked from choice in the shade. As the long struggle
of discretion between them drew to its close, he wondered more and
more whether she could see his eagerness to get back to that which
she had brought him away from. Condemned by Spanish Providence to
spend a day in Madrid between their trains, it was but natural to
go again to the Prado. Jon was elaborately casual this time before
his Goya girl. Now that he was going back to her, he could afford a
lesser scrutiny. It was his mother who lingered before the picture,
saying:</p>

<p>"The face and the figure of the girl are exquisite."</p>

<p>Jon heard her uneasily. Did she understand? But he felt once
more that he was no match for her in self-control and subtlety. She
could, in some supersensitive way, of which he had not the secret,
feel the pulse of his thoughts; she knew by instinct what he hoped
and feared and wished. It made him terribly uncomfortable and
guilty, having, beyond most boys, a conscience. He wished she would
be frank with him, he almost hoped for an open struggle. But none
came, and steadily, silently, they travelled north. Thus did he
first learn how much better than men women play a waiting game. In
Paris they had again to pause for a day. Jon was grieved because it
lasted two, owing to certain matters in connection with a
dressmaker; as if his mother, who looked beautiful in anything, had
any need of dresses! The happiest moment of his travel was that
when he stepped on to the Folkestone boat.</p>

<p>Standing by the bulwark rail, with her arm in his, she said</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you haven't enjoyed it much, Jon. But you've been
very sweet to me."</p>

<p>Jon squeezed her arm.</p>

<p>"Oh I yes, I've enjoyed it awfully-except for my head
lately."</p>

<p>And now that the end had come, he really had, feeling a sort of
glamour over the past weeks&mdash;a kind of painful pleasure, such
as he had tried to screw into those lines about the voice in the
night crying; a feeling such as he had known as a small boy
listening avidly to Chopin, yet wanting to cry. And he wondered why
it was that he couldn't say to her quite simply what she had said
to him:</p>

<p>"You were very sweet to me." Odd&mdash;one never could be nice
and natural like that! He substituted the words: "I expect we shall
be sick."</p>

<p>They were, and reached London somewhat attenuated, having been
away six weeks and two days, without a single allusion to the
subject which had hardly ever ceased to occupy their minds.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.&mdash;FATHERS AND DAUGHTERS</h3>

<p>Deprived of his wife and son by the Spanish adventure, Jolyon
found the solitude at Robin Hill intolerable. A philosopher when he
has all that he wants is different from a philosopher when he has
not. Accustomed, however, to the idea, if not to the reality of
resignation, he would perhaps have faced it out but for his
daughter June. He was a "lame duck" now, and on her conscience.
Having achieved&mdash;momentarily&mdash;the rescue of an etcher in
low circumstances, which she happened to have in hand, she appeared
at Robin Hill a fortnight after Irene and Jon had gone. June was
living now in a tiny house with a big studio at Chiswick. A Forsyte
of the best period, so far as the lack of responsibility was
concerned, she had overcome the difficulty of a reduced income in a
manner satisfactory to herself and her father. The rent of the
Gallery off Cork Street which he had bought for her and her
increased income tax happening to balance, it had been quite
simpl&mdash;she no longer paid him the rent. The Gallery might be
expected now at any time, after eighteen years of barren usufruct,
to pay its way, so that she was sure her father would not feel it.
Through this device she still had twelve hundred a year, and by
reducing what she ate, and, in place of two Belgians in a poor way,
employing one Austrian in a poorer, practically the same surplus
for the relief of genius. After three days at Robin Hill she
carried her father back with her to Town. In those three days she
had stumbled on the secret he had kept for two years, and had
instantly decided to cure him. She knew, in fact, the very man. He
had done wonders with. Paul Post&mdash;that painter a little in
advance of Futurism; and she was impatient with her father because
his eyebrows would go up, and because he had heard of neither. Of
course, if he hadn't "faith" he would never get well! It was absurd
not to have faith in the man who had healed Paul Post so that he
had only just relapsed, from having overworked, or overlived,
himself again. The great thing about this healer was that he relied
on Nature. He had made a special study of the symptoms of
Nature&mdash;when his patient failed in any natural symptom he
supplied the poison which caused it&mdash;and there you were! She
was extremely hopeful. Her father had clearly not been living a
natural life at Robin Hill, and she intended to provide the
symptoms. He was&mdash;she felt&mdash;out of touch with the times,
which was not natural; his heart wanted stimulating. In the little
Chiswick house she and the Austrian&mdash;a grateful soul, so
devoted to June for rescuing her that she was in danger of decease
from overwork&mdash;stimulated Jolyon in all sorts of ways,
preparing him for his cure. But they could not keep his eyebrows
down; as, for example, when the Austrian woke him at eight o'clock
just as he was going to sleep, or June took The Times away from
him, because it was unnatural to read "that stuff" when he ought to
be taking an interest in "life." He never failed, indeed, to be
astonished at her resource, especially in the evenings. For his
benefit, as she declared, though he suspected that she also got
something out of it, she assembled the Age so far as it was
satellite to genius; and with some solemnity it would move up and
down the studio before him in the Fox-trot, and that more mental
form of dancing&mdash;the One-step&mdash;which so pulled against
the music, that Jolyon's eyebrows would be almost lost in his hair
from wonder at the strain it must impose on the dancer's
will-power. Aware that, hung on the line in the Water Colour
Society, he was a back number to those with any pretension to be
called artists, he would sit in the darkest corner he could find,
and wonder about rhythm, on which so long ago he had been raised.
And when June brought some girl or young man up to him, he would
rise humbly to their level so far as that was possible, and think:
'Dear me! This is very dull for them!' Having his father's
perennial sympathy with Youth, he used to get very tired from
entering into their points of view. But it was all stimulating, and
he never failed in admiration of his daughter's indomitable spirit.
Even genius itself attended these gatherings now and then, with its
nose on one side; and June always introduced it to her father.
This, she felt, was exceptionally good for him, for genius was a
natural symptom he had never had&mdash;fond as she was of him.</p>

<p>Certain as a man can be that she was his own daughter, he often
wondered whence she got herself&mdash;her red-gold hair, now greyed
into a special colour; her direct, spirited face, so different from
his own rather folded and subtilised countenance, her little lithe
figure, when he and most of the Forsytes were tall. And he would
dwell on the origin of species, and debate whether she might be
Danish or Celtic. Celtic, he thought, from her pugnacity, and her
taste in fillets and djibbahs. It was not too much to say that he
preferred her to the Age with which she was surrounded, youthful
though, for the greater part, it was. She took, however, too much
interest in his teeth, for he still had some of those natural
symptoms. Her dentist at once found "Staphylococcus aureus present
in pure culture" (which might cause boils, of course), and wanted
to take out all the teeth he had and supply him with two complete
sets of unnatural symptoms. Jolyon's native tenacity was roused,
and in the studio that evening he developed his objections. He had
never had any boils, and his own teeth would last his time. Of
course&mdash;June admitted&mdash;they would last his time if he
didn't have them out! But if he had more teeth he would have a
better heart and his time would be longer. His
recalcitrance&mdash;she said&mdash;was a symptom of his whole
attitude; he was taking it lying down. He ought to be fighting.
When was he going to see the man who had cured Paul Post? Jolyon
was very sorry, but the fact was he was not going to see him. June
chafed. Pondridge&mdash;she said&mdash;the healer, was such a fine
man, and he had such difficulty in making two ends meet, and
getting his theories recognised. It was just such indifference and
prejudice as her father manifested which was keeping him back. It
would be so splendid for both of them!</p>

<p>"I perceive," said Jolyon, "that you are trying to kill two
birds with one stone."</p>

<p>"To cure, you mean!" cried June.</p>

<p>"My dear, it's the same thing."</p>

<p>June protested. It was unfair to say that without a trial.</p>

<p>Jolyon thought he might not have the chance, of saying it
after.</p>

<p>"Dad!" cried June, "you're hopeless."</p>

<p>"That," said Jolyon, "is a fact, but I wish to remain hopeless
as long as possible. I shall let sleeping dogs lie, my child. They
are quiet at present."</p>

<p>"That's not giving science a chance," cried June. "You've no
idea how devoted Pondridge is. He puts his science before
everything."</p>

<p>"Just," replied Jolyon, puffing the mild cigarette to which he
was reduced, "as Mr. Paul Post puts his art, eh? Art for Art's
sake&mdash;Science for the sake of Science. I know those
enthusiastic egomaniac gentry. They vivisect you without blinking.
I'm enough of a Forsyte to give them the go-by, June."</p>

<p>"Dad," said June, "if you only knew how old-fashioned that
sounds! Nobody can afford to be half-hearted nowadays."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," murmured Jolyon, with his smile, "that's the only
natural symptom with which Mr. Pondridge need not supply me. We are
born to be extreme or to be moderate, my dear; though, if you'll
forgive my saying so, half the people nowadays who believe they're
extreme are really very moderate. I'm getting on as well as I can
expect, and I must leave it at that."</p>

<p>June was silent, having experienced in her time the inexorable
character of her father's amiable obstinacy so far as his own
freedom of action was concerned.</p>

<p>How he came to let her know why Irene had taken Jon to Spain
puzzled Jolyon, for he had little confidence in her discretion.
After she had brooded on the news, it brought a rather sharp
discussion, during which he perceived to the full the fundamental
opposition between her active temperament and his wife's passivity.
He even gathered that a little soreness still remained from that
generation-old struggle between them over the body of Philip
Bosinney, in which the passive had so signally triumphed over the
active principle.</p>

<p>According to June, it was foolish and even cowardly to hide the
past from Jon. Sheer opportunism, she called it.</p>

<p>"Which," Jolyon put in mildly, "is the working principle of real
life, my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried June, "you don't really defend her for not telling
Jon, Dad. If it were left to you, you would."</p>

<p>"I might, but simply because I know he must find out, which will
be worse than if we told him."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you tell him? It's just sleeping dogs
again."</p>

<p>"My dear," said Jolyon, "I wouldn't for the world go against
Irene's instinct. He's her boy."</p>

<p>"Yours too," cried June.</p>

<p>"What is a man's instinct compared with a mother's?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think it's very weak of you."</p>

<p>"I dare say," said Jolyon, "I dare say."</p>

<p>And that was all she got from him; but the matter rankled in her
brain. She could not bear sleeping dogs. And there stirred in her a
tortuous impulse to push the matter toward decision. Jon ought to
be told, so that either his feeling might be nipped in the bud, or,
flowering in spite of the past, come to fruition. And she
determined to see Fleur, and judge for herself. When June
determined on anything, delicacy became a somewhat minor
consideration. After all, she was Soames' cousin, and they were
both interested in pictures. She would go and tell him that he
ought to buy a Paul Post, or perhaps a piece of sculpture by Boris
Strumolowski, and of course she would say nothing to her father.
She went on the following Sunday, looking so determined that she
had some difficulty in getting a cab at Reading station. The river
country was lovely in those days of her own month, and June ached
at its loveliness. She who had passed through this life without
knowing what union was had a love of natural beauty which was
almost madness. And when she came to that choice spot where Soames
had pitched his tent, she dismissed her cab, because, business
over, she wanted to revel in the bright water and the woods. She
appeared at his front door, therefore, as a mere pedestrian, and
sent in her card. It was in June's character to know that when her
nerves were fluttering she was doing something worth while. If
one's nerves did not flutter, she was taking the line of least
resistance, and knew that nobleness was not obliging her. She was
conducted to a drawing-room, which, though not in her style, showed
every mark of fastidious elegance. Thinking, 'Too much
taste&mdash;too many knick-knacks,' she saw in an old
lacquer-framed mirror the figure of a girl coming in from the
verandah. Clothed in white, and holding some white roses in her
hand, she had, reflected in that silvery-grey pool of glass, a
vision-like appearance, as if a pretty ghost had come out of the
green garden.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said June, turning round. "I'm a cousin of your
father's."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I saw you in that confectioner's."</p>

<p>"With my young stepbrother. Is your father in?"</p>

<p>"He will be directly. He's only gone for a little walk."</p>

<p>June slightly narrowed her blue eyes, and lifted her decided
chin.</p>

<p>"Your name's Fleur, isn't it? I've heard of you from Holly. What
do you think of Jon?"</p>

<p>The girl lifted the roses in her hand, looked at them, and
answered calmly:</p>

<p>"He's quite a nice boy."</p>

<p>"Not a bit like Holly or me, is he?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit."</p>

<p>'She's cool,' thought June.</p>

<p>And suddenly the girl said: "I wish you'd tell me why our
families don't get on?"</p>

<p>Confronted with the question she had advised her father to
answer, June was silent; whether because this girl was trying to
get something out of her, or simply because what one would do
theoretically is not always what one will do when it comes to the
point.</p>

<p>"You know," said the girl, "the surest way to make people find
out the worst is to keep them ignorant. My father's told me it was
a quarrel about property. But I don't believe it; we've both got
heaps. They wouldn't have been so bourgeois as all that."</p>

<p>June flushed. The word applied to her grandfather and father
offended her.</p>

<p>"My grandfather," she said, "was very generous, and my father
is, too; neither of them was in the least bourgeois."</p>

<p>"Well, what was it then?" repeated the girl: Conscious that this
young Forsyte meant having what she wanted, June at once determined
to prevent her, and to get something for herself instead.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to know?"</p>

<p>The girl smelled at her roses. "I only want to know because they
won't tell me."</p>

<p>"Well, it was about property, but there's more than one
kind."</p>

<p>"That makes it worse. Now I really must know."</p>

<p>June's small and resolute face quivered. She was wearing a round
cap, and her hair had fluffed out under it. She looked quite young
at that moment, rejuvenated by encounter.</p>

<p>"You know," she said, "I saw you drop your handkerchief. Is
there anything between you and Jon? Because, if so, you'd better
drop that too."</p>

<p>The girl grew paler, but she smiled.</p>

<p>"If there were, that isn't the way to make me."</p>

<p>At the gallantry of that reply, June held out her hand.</p>

<p>"I like you; but I don't like your father; I never have. We may
as well be frank."</p>

<p>"Did you come down to tell him that?"</p>

<p>June laughed. "No; I came down to see you."</p>

<p>"How delightful of you."</p>

<p>This girl could fence.</p>

<p>"I'm two and a half times your age," said June, "but I quite
sympathize. It's horrid not to have one's own way."</p>

<p>The girl smiled again. "I really think you might tell me."</p>

<p>How the child stuck to her point</p>

<p>"It's not my secret. But I'll see what I can do, because I think
both you and Jon ought to be told. And now I'll say good-bye."</p>

<p>"Won't you wait and see Father?"</p>

<p>June shook her head. "How can I get over to the other side?"</p>

<p>"I'll row you across."</p>

<p>"Look!" said June impulsively, "next time you're in London, come
and see me. This is where I live. I generally have young people in
the evening. But I shouldn't tell your father that you're
coming."</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>Watching her scull the skiff across, June thought: 'She's
awfully pretty and well made. I never thought Soames would have a
daughter as pretty as this. She and Jon would make a lovely
couple.</p>

<p>The instinct to couple, starved within herself, was always at
work in June. She stood watching Fleur row back; the girl took her
hand off a scull to wave farewell, and June walked languidly on
between the meadows and the river, with an ache in her heart. Youth
to youth, like the dragon-flies chasing each other, and love like
the sun warming them through and through. Her youth! So long
ago&mdash;when Phil and she&mdash;And since? Nothing&mdash;no one
had been quite what she had wanted. And so she had missed it all.
But what a coil was round those two young things, if they really
were in love, as Holly would have it&mdash;as her father, and
Irene, and Soames himself seemed to dread. What a coil, and what a
barrier! And the itch for the future, the contempt, as it were, for
what was overpast, which forms the active principle, moved in the
heart of one who ever believed that what one wanted was more
important than what other people did not want. From the bank,
awhile, in the warm summer stillness, she watched the water-lily
plants and willow leaves, the fishes rising; sniffed the scent of
grass and meadow-sweet, wondering how she could force everybody to
be happy. Jon and Fleur! Two little lame ducks&mdash;charming
callow yellow little ducks! A great pity! Surely something could be
done! One must not take such situations lying down. She walked on,
and reached a station, hot and cross.</p>

<p>That evening, faithful to the impulse toward direct action,
which made many people avoid her, she said to her father:</p>

<p>"Dad, I've been down to see young Fleur. I think she's very
attractive. It's no good hiding our heads under our wings, is
it?"</p>

<p>The startled Jolyon set down his barley-water, and began
crumbling his bread.</p>

<p>"It's what you appear to be doing," he said. "Do you realise
whose daughter she is?"</p>

<p>"Can't the dead past bury its dead?"</p>

<p>Jolyon rose.</p>

<p>"Certain things can never be buried."</p>

<p>"I disagree," said June. "It's that which stands in the way of
all happiness and progress. You don't understand the Age, Dad. It's
got no use for outgrown things. Why do you think it matters so
terribly that Jon should know about his mother? Who pays any
attention to that sort of thing now? The marriage laws are just as
they were when Soames and Irene couldn't get a divorce, and you had
to come in. We've moved, and they haven't. So nobody cares.
Marriage without a decent chance of relief is only a sort of
slave-owning; people oughtn't to own each other. Everybody sees
that now. If Irene broke such laws, what does it matter?"</p>

<p>"It's not for me to disagree there," said Jolyon; "but that's
all quite beside the mark. This is a matter of human feeling."</p>

<p>"Of course it is," cried June, "the human feeling of those two
young things."</p>

<p>"My dear," said Jolyon with gentle exasperation; "you're talking
nonsense."</p>

<p>"I'm not. If they prove to be really fond of each other, why
should they be made unhappy because of the past?"</p>

<p>"You haven't lived that past. I have&mdash;through the feelings
of my wife; through my own nerves and my imagination, as only one
who is devoted can."</p>

<p>June, too, rose, and began to wander restlessly.</p>

<p>"If," she said suddenly, "she were the daughter of Philip
Bosinney, I could understand you better. Irene loved him, she never
loved Soames."</p>

<p>Jolyon uttered a deep sound-the sort of noise an Italian peasant
woman utters to her mule. His heart had begun beating furiously,
but he paid no attention to it, quite carried away by his
feelings.</p>

<p>"That shows how little you understand. Neither I nor Jon, if I
know him, would mind a love-past. It's the brutality of a union
without love. This girl is the daughter of the man who once owned
Jon's mother as a negro-slave was owned. You can't lay that ghost;
don't try to, June! It's asking us to see Jon joined to the flesh
and blood of the man who possessed Jon's mother against her will.
It's no good mincing words; I want it clear once for all. And now I
mustn't talk any more, or I shall have to sit up with this all
night." And, putting his hand over his heart, Jolyon turned his
back on his daughter and stood looking at the river Thames.</p>

<p>June, who by nature never saw a hornet's nest until she had put
her head into it, was seriously alarmed. She came and slipped her
arm through his. Not convinced that he was right, and she herself
wrong, because that was not natural to her, she was yet profoundly
impressed by the obvious fact that the subject was very bad for
him. She rubbed her cheek against his shoulder, and said
nothing.</p>

<p>After taking her elderly cousin across, Fleur did not land at
once, but pulled in among the reeds, into the sunshine. The
peaceful beauty of the afternoon seduced for a little one not much
given to the vague and poetic. In the field beyond the bank where
her skiff lay up, a machine drawn by a grey horse was turning an
early field of hay. She watched the grass cascading over and behind
the light wheels with fascination&mdash;it looked so cool and
fresh. The click and swish blended with the rustle of the willows
and the poplars, and the cooing of a wood-pigeon, in a true river
song. Alongside, in the deep green water, weeds, like yellow
snakes, were writhing and nosing with the current; pied cattle on
the farther side stood in the shade lazily swishing their tails. It
was an afternoon to dream. And she took out Jon's letters&mdash;not
flowery effusions, but haunted in their recital of things seen and
done by a longing very agreeable to her, and all ending "Your
devoted J." Fleur was not sentimental, her desires were ever
concrete and concentrated, but what poetry there was in the
daughter of Soames and Annette had certainly in those weeks of
waiting gathered round her memories of Jon. They all belonged to
grass and blossom, flowers and running water. She enjoyed him in
the scents absorbed by her crinkling nose. The stars could persuade
her that she was standing beside him in the centre of the map of
Spain; and of an early morning the dewy cobwebs, the hazy sparkle
and promise of the day down in the garden, were Jon personified to
her.</p>

<p>Two white swans came majestically by, while she was reading his
letters, followed by their brood of six young swans in a line, with
just so much water between each tail and head, a flotilla of grey
destroyers. Fleur thrust her letters back, got out her sculls, and
pulled up to the landing-stage. Crossing the lawn, she wondered
whether she should tell her father of June's visit. If he learned
of it from the butler, he might think it odd if she did not. It
gave her, too, another chance to startle out of him the reason of
the feud. She went, therefore, up the road to meet him.</p>

<p>Soames had gone to look at a patch of ground on which the Local
Authorities were proposing to erect a Sanatorium for people with
weak lungs. Faithful to his native individualism, he took no part
in local affairs, content to pay the rates which were always going
up. He could not, however, remain indifferent to this new and
dangerous scheme. The site was not half a mile from his own house.
He was quite of opinion that the country should stamp out
tuberculosis; but this was not the place. It should be done farther
away. He took, indeed, an attitude common to all true Forsytes,
that disability of any sort in other people was not his affair, and
the State should do its business without prejudicing in any way the
natural advantages which he had acquired or inherited. Francie, the
most free-spirited Forsyte of his generation (except perhaps that
fellow Jolyon) had once asked him in her malicious way: "Did you
ever see the name Forsyte in a subscription list, Soames?" That was
as it might be, but a Sanatorium would depreciate the
neighbourhood, and he should certainly sign the petition which was
being got up against it. Returning with this decision fresh within
him, he saw Fleur coming.</p>

<p>She was showing him more affection of late, and the quiet time
down here with her in this summer weather had been making him feel
quite young; Annette was always running up to Town for one thing or
another, so that he had Fleur to himself almost as much as he could
wish. To be sure, young Mont had formed a habit of appearing on his
motor-cycle almost every other day. Thank goodness, the young
fellow had shaved off his half-toothbrushes, and no longer looked
like a mountebank! With a girl friend of Fleur's who was staying in
the house, and a neighbouring youth or so, they made two couples
after dinner, in the hall, to the music of the electric pianola,
which performed Fox-trots unassisted, with a surprised shine on its
expressive surface. Annette, even, now and then passed gracefully
up and down in the arms of one or other of the young men. And
Soames, coming to the drawing-room door, would lift his nose a
little sideways, and watch them, waiting to catch a smile from
Fleur; then move back to his chair by the drawing-room hearth, to
peruse The Times or some other collector's price list. To his
ever-anxious eyes Fleur showed no signs of remembering that caprice
of hers.</p>

<p>When she reached him on the dusty road, he slipped his hand
within her arm.</p>

<p>"Who, do you think, has been to see you, Dad? She couldn't wait!
Guess!"</p>

<p>"I never guess," said Soames uneasily. "Who?"</p>

<p>"Your cousin, June Forsyte."</p>

<p>Quite unconsciously Soames gripped her arm. "What did she
want?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But it was rather breaking through the feud,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Feud? What feud?"</p>

<p>"The one that exists in your imagination, dear."</p>

<p>Soames dropped her arm. Was she mocking, or trying to draw him
on?</p>

<p>"I suppose she wanted me to buy a picture," he said at last.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. Perhaps it was just family affection."</p>

<p>"She's only a first cousin once removed," muttered Soames.</p>

<p>"And the daughter of your enemy."</p>

<p>"What d'you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, dear; I thought he was."</p>

<p>"Enemy!" repeated Soames. "It's ancient history. I don't know
where you get your notions."</p>

<p>"From June Forsyte."</p>

<p>It had come to her as an inspiration that if he thought she
knew, or were on the edge of knowledge, he would tell her.</p>

<p>Soames was startled, but she had underrated his caution and
tenacity.</p>

<p>"If you know," he said coldly, "why do you plague me?"</p>

<p>Fleur saw that she had overreached herself.</p>

<p>"I don't want to plague you, darling. As you say, why want to
know more? Why want to know anything of that 'small'
mystery&mdash;Je m'en fiche, as Profond says?"</p>

<p>"That chap!" said Soames profoundly.</p>

<p>That chap, indeed, played a considerable, if invisible, part
this summer&mdash;for he had not turned up again. Ever since the
Sunday when Fleur had drawn attention to him prowling on the lawn,
Soames had thought of him a good deal, and always in connection
with Annette, for no reason, except that she was looking handsomer
than for some time past. His possessive instinct, subtle, less
formal, more elastic since the War, kept all misgiving underground.
As one looks on some American river, quiet and pleasant, knowing
that an alligator perhaps is lying in the mud with his snout just
raised and indistinguishable from a snag of wood&mdash;so Soames
looked on the river of his own existence, subconscious of Monsieur
Profond, refusing to see more than the suspicion of his snout. He
had at this epoch in his life practically all he wanted, and was as
nearly happy as his nature would permit. His senses were at rest;
his affections found all the vent they needed in his daughter; his
collection was well known, his money well invested; his health
excellent, save for a touch of liver now and again; he had not yet
begun to worry seriously about what would happen after death,
inclining to think that nothing would happen. He resembled one of
his own gilt-edged securities, and to knock the gilt off by seeing
anything he could avoid seeing would be, he felt instinctively,
perverse and retrogressive. Those two crumpled rose-leaves, Fleur's
caprice and Monsieur Profond's snout, would level away if he lay on
them industriously.</p>

<p>That evening Chance, which visits the lives of even the
best-invested Forsytes, put a clue into Fleur's hands. Her father
came down to dinner without a handkerchief, and had occasion to
blow his nose.</p>

<p>"I'll get you one, dear," she had said, and ran upstairs. In the
sachet where she sought for it&mdash;an old sachet of very faded
silk&mdash;there were two compartments: one held handkerchiefs; the
other was buttoned, and contained something flat and hard. By some
childish impulse Fleur unbuttoned it. There was a frame and in it a
photograph of herself as a little girl. She gazed at it,
fascinated, as one is by one's own presentment. It slipped under
her fidgeting thumb, and she saw that another photograph was
behind. She pressed her own down further, and perceived a face,
which she seemed to know, of a young woman, very good-looking, in a
very old style of evening dress. Slipping her own photograph up
over it again, she took out a handkerchief and went down. Only on
the stairs did she identify that face. Surely&mdash;surely Jon's
mother! The conviction came as a shock. And she stood still in a
flurry of thought. Why, of course! Jon's father had married the
woman her father had wanted to marry, had cheated him out of her,
perhaps. Then, afraid of showing by her manner that she had lighted
on his secret, she refused to think further, and, shaking out the
silk handkerchief, entered the dining-room.</p>

<p>"I chose the softest, Father."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Soames; "I only use those after a cold. Never
mind!"</p>

<p>That evening passed for Fleur in putting two and two together;
recalling the look on her father's face in the confectioner's
shop&mdash;a look strange and coldly intimate, a queer look. He
must have loved that woman very much to have kept her photograph
all this time, in spite of having lost her. Unsparing and
matter-of-fact, her mind darted to his relations with her own
mother. Had he ever really loved her? She thought not. Jon was the
son of the woman he had really loved. Surely, then, he ought not to
mind his daughter loving him; it only wanted getting used to. And a
sigh of sheer relief was caught in the folds of her nightgown
slipping over her head.</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.&mdash;MEETINGS</h3>

<p>Youth only recognises Age by fits and starts. Jon, for one, had
never really seen his father's age till he came back from Spain.
The face of the fourth Jolyon, worn by waiting, gave him quite a
shock&mdash;it looked so wan and old. His father's mask had been
forced awry by the emotion of the meeting, so that the boy suddenly
realised how much he must have felt their absence. He summoned to
his aid the thought: 'Well, I didn't want to go!' It was out of
date for Youth to defer to Age. But Jon was by no means typically
modern. His father had always been "so jolly" to him, and to feel
that one meant to begin again at once the conduct which his father
had suffered six weeks' loneliness to cure was not agreeable.</p>

<p>At the question, "Well, old man, how did the great Goya strike
you?" his conscience pricked him badly. The great Goya only existed
because he had created a face which resembled Fleur's.</p>

<p>On the night of their return, he went to bed full of
compunction; but awoke full of anticipation. It was only the fifth
of July, and no meeting was fixed with Fleur until the ninth. He
was to have three days at home before going back to farm. Somehow
he must contrive to see her!</p>

<p>In the lives of men an inexorable rhythm, caused by the need for
trousers, not even the fondest parents can deny. On the second day,
therefore, Jon went to Town, and having satisfied his conscience by
ordering what was indispensable in Conduit Street, turned his face
toward Piccadilly. Stratton Street, where her Club was, adjoined
Devonshire House. It would be the merest chance that she should be
at her Club. But he dawdled down Bond Street with a beating heart,
noticing the superiority of all other young men to himself. They
wore their clothes with such an air; they had assurance; they were
old. He was suddenly overwhelmed by the conviction that Fleur must
have forgotten him. Absorbed in his own feeling for her all these
weeks, he had mislaid that possibility. The corners of his mouth
drooped, his hands felt clammy. Fleur with the pick of youth at the
beck of her smile-Fleur incomparable! It was an evil moment. Jon,
however, had a great idea that one must be able to face anything.
And he braced himself with that dour refection in front of a
bric-a-brac shop. At this high-water mark of what was once the
London season, there was nothing to mark it out from any other
except a grey top hat or two, and the sun. Jon moved on, and
turning the corner into Piccadilly, ran into Val Dartie moving
toward the Iseeum Club, to which he had just been elected.</p>

<p>"Hallo! young man! Where are you off to?"</p>

<p>Jon gushed. "I've just been to my tailor's."</p>

<p>Val looked him up and down. "That's good! I'm going in here to
order some cigarettes; then come and have some lunch."</p>

<p>Jon thanked him. He might get news of her from Val!</p>

<p>The condition of England, that nightmare of its Press and Public
men, was seen in different perspective within the tobacconist's
which they now entered.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; precisely the cigarette I used to supply your father
with. Bless me! Mr. Montague Dartie was a customer here
from&mdash;let me see&mdash;the year Melton won the Derby. One of
my very best customers he was." A faint smile illumined the
tobacconist's face. "Many's the tip he's given me, to be sure! I
suppose he took a couple of hundred of these every week, year in,
year out, and never changed his cigarette. Very affable gentleman,
brought me a lot of custom. I was sorry he met with that accident.
One misses an old customer like him."</p>

<p>Val smiled. His father's decease had closed an account which had
been running longer, probably, than any other; and in a ring of
smoke puffed out from that time-honoured cigarette he seemed to see
again his father's face, dark, good-looking, moustachioed, a little
puffy, in the only halo it had earned. His father had his fame
here, anyway&mdash;a man who smoked two hundred cigarettes a week,
who could give tips, and run accounts for ever! To his tobacconist
a hero! Even that was some distinction to inherit!</p>

<p>"I pay cash," he said; "how much?"</p>

<p>"To his son, sir, and cash&mdash;ten and six. I shall never
forget Mr. Montague Dartie. I've known him stand talkin' to me half
an hour. We don't get many like him now, with everybody in such a
hurry. The War was bad for manners, sir&mdash;it was bad for
manners. You were in it, I see."</p>

<p>"No," said Val, tapping his knee, "I got this in the war before.
Saved my life, I expect. Do you want any cigarettes, Jon?"</p>

<p>Rather ashamed, Jon murmured, "I don't smoke, you know," and saw
the tobacconist's lips twisted, as if uncertain whether to say
"Good God!" or "Now's your chance, sir!"</p>

<p>"That's right," said Val; "keep off it while you can. You'll
want it when you take a knock. This is really the same tobacco,
then?"</p>

<p>"Identical, sir; a little dearer, that's all. Wonderful staying
power&mdash;the British Empire, I always say."</p>

<p>"Send me down a hundred a week to this address, and invoice it
monthly. Come on, Jon."</p>

<p>Jon entered the Iseeum with curiosity. Except to lunch now and
then at the Hotch-Potch with his father, he had never been in a
London Club. The Iseeum, comfortable and unpretentious, did not
move, could not, so long as George Forsyte sat on its Committee,
where his culinary acumen was almost the controlling force. The
Club had made a stand against the newly rich, and it had taken all
George Forsyte's prestige, and praise of him as a "good sportsman,"
to bring in Prosper Profond.</p>

<p>The two were lunching together when the half-brothers-in-law
entered the dining-room, and attracted by George's forefinger, sat
down at their table, Val with his shrewd eyes and charming smile,
Jon with solemn lips and an attractive shyness in his glance. There
was an air of privilege around that corner table, as though past
masters were eating there. Jon was fascinated by the hypnotic
atmosphere. The waiter, lean in the chaps, pervaded with such
free-masonical deference. He seemed to hang on George Forsyte's
lips, to watch the gloat in his eye with a kind of sympathy, to
follow the movements of the heavy club-marked silver fondly. His
liveried arm and confidential voice alarmed Jon, they came so
secretly over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Except for George's "Your grandfather tipped me once; he was a
deuced good judge of a cigar!" neither he nor the other past master
took any notice of him, and he was grateful for this. The talk was
all about the breeding, points, and prices of horses, and he
listened to it vaguely at first, wondering how it was possible to
retain so much knowledge in a head. He could not take his eyes off
the dark past master&mdash;what he said was so deliberate and
discouraging&mdash;such heavy, queer, smiled-out words. Jon was
thinking of butterflies, when he heard him say:</p>

<p>"I want to see Mr. Soames Forsyde take an interest in
'orses."</p>

<p>"Old Soames! He's too dry a file!"</p>

<p>With all his might Jon tried not to grow red, while the dark
past master went on.</p>

<p>"His daughter's an attractive small girl. Mr. Soames Forsyde is
a bit old-fashioned. I want to see him have a pleasure some day."
George Forsyte grinned.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry; he's not so miserable as he looks. He'll never
show he's enjoying anything&mdash;they might try and take it from
him. Old Soames! Once bit, twice shy!"</p>

<p>"Well, Jon," said Val, hastily, "if you've finished, we'll go
and have coffee."</p>

<p>"Who were those?" Jon asked, on the stairs. "I didn't
quite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Old George Forsyte is a first cousin of your father's and of my
Uncle Soames. He's always been here. The other chap, Profond, is a
queer fish. I think he's hanging round Soames' wife, if you ask
me!"</p>

<p>Jon looked at him, startled. "But that's awful," he said: "I
mean&mdash;for Fleur."</p>

<p>"Don't suppose Fleur cares very much; she's very
up-to-date."</p>

<p>"Her mother!"</p>

<p>"You're very green, Jon."</p>

<p>Jon grew red. "Mothers," he stammered angrily, "are
different."</p>

<p>"You're right," said Val suddenly; "but things aren't what they
were when I was your age. There's a 'To-morrow we die' feeling.
That's what old George meant about my Uncle Soames. He doesn't mean
to die to-morrow."</p>

<p>Jon said, quickly: "What's the matter between him and my
father?"</p>

<p>"Stable secret, Jon. Take my advice, and bottle up. You'll do no
good by knowing. Have a liqueur?"</p>

<p>Jon shook his head.</p>

<p>"I hate the way people keep things from one," he muttered, "and
then sneer at one for being green."</p>

<p>"Well, you can ask Holly. If she won't tell you, you'll believe
it's for your own good, I suppose."</p>

<p>Jon got up. "I must go now; thanks awfully for the lunch."</p>

<p>Val smiled up at him half-sorry, and yet amused. The boy looked
so upset.</p>

<p>"All right! See you on Friday."</p>

<p>"I don't know," murmured Jon.</p>

<p>And he did not. This conspiracy of silence made him desperate.
It was humiliating to be treated like a child! He retraced his
moody steps to Stratton Street. But he would go to her Club now,
and find out the worst! To his enquiry the reply was that Miss
Forsyte was not in the Club. She might be in perhaps later. She was
often in on Monday&mdash;they could not say. Jon said he would call
again, and, crossing into the Green Park, flung himself down under
a tree. The sun was bright, and a breeze fluttered the leaves of
the young lime-tree beneath which he lay; but his heart ached. Such
darkness seemed gathered round his happiness. He heard Big Ben
chime "Three" above the traffic. The sound moved something in him,
and, taking out a piece of paper, he began to scribble on it with a
pencil. He had jotted a stanza, and was searching the grass for
another verse, when something hard touched his shoulder-a green
parasol. There above him stood Fleur!</p>

<p>"They told me you'd been, and were coming back. So I thought you
might be out here; and you are&mdash;it's rather wonderful!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Fleur! I thought you'd have forgotten me."</p>

<p>"When I told you that I shouldn't!"</p>

<p>Jon seized her arm.</p>

<p>"It's too much luck! Let's get away from this side." He almost
dragged her on through that too thoughtfully regulated Park, to
find some cover where they could sit and hold each other's
hands.</p>

<p>"Hasn't anybody cut in?" he said, gazing round at her lashes, in
suspense above her cheeks.</p>

<p>"There is a young idiot, but he doesn't count."</p>

<p>Jon felt a twitch of compassion for the-young idiot.</p>

<p>"You know I've had sunstroke; I didn't tell you."</p>

<p>"Really! Was it interesting?"</p>

<p>"No. Mother was an angel. Has anything happened to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Except that I think I've found out what's wrong
between our families, Jon."</p>

<p>His heart began beating very fast.</p>

<p>"I believe my father wanted to marry your mother, and your
father got her instead."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"I came on a photo of her; it was in a frame behind a photo of
me. Of course, if he was very fond of her, that would have made him
pretty mad, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>Jon thought for a minute. "Not if she loved my father best."</p>

<p>"But suppose they were engaged?"</p>

<p>"If we were engaged, and you found you loved somebody better, I
might go cracked, but I shouldn't grudge it you."</p>

<p>"I should. You mustn't ever do that with me, Jon.</p>

<p>"My God! Not much!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe that he's ever really cared for my mother."</p>

<p>Jon was silent. Val's words&mdash;the two past masters in the
Club!</p>

<p>"You see, we don't know," went on Fleur; "it may have been a
great shock. She may have behaved badly to him. People do."</p>

<p>"My mother wouldn't."</p>

<p>Fleur shrugged her shoulders. "I don't think we know much about
our fathers and mothers. We just see them in the light of the way
they treat us; but they've treated other people, you know, before
we were born-plenty, I expect. You see, they're both old. Look at
your father, with three separate families!"</p>

<p>"Isn't there any place," cried Jon, "in all this beastly London
where we can be alone?"</p>

<p>"Only a taxi."</p>

<p>"Let's get one, then."</p>

<p>When they were installed, Fleur asked suddenly: "Are you going
back to Robin Hill? I should like to see where you live, Jon. I'm
staying with my aunt for the night, but I could get back in time
for dinner. I wouldn't come to the house, of course."</p>

<p>Jon gazed at her enraptured.</p>

<p>"Splendid! I can show it you from the copse, we shan't meet
anybody. There's a train at four."</p>

<p>The god of property and his Forsytes great and small, leisured,
official, commercial, or professional, like the working classes,
still worked their seven hours a day, so that those two of the
fourth generation travelled down to Robin Hill in an empty
first-class carriage, dusty and sun-warmed, of that too early
train. They travelled in blissful silence, holding each other's
hands.</p>

<p>At the station they saw no one except porters, and a villager or
two unknown to Jon, and walked out up the lane, which smelled of
dust and honeysuckle.</p>

<p>For Jon&mdash;sure of her now, and without separation before
him&mdash;it was a miraculous dawdle, more wonderful than those on
the Downs, or along the river Thames. It was
love-in-a-mist&mdash;one of those illumined pages of Life, where
every word and smile, and every light touch they gave each other
were as little gold and red and blue butterflies and flowers and
birds scrolled in among the text&mdash;a happy communing, without
afterthought, which lasted thirty-seven minutes. They reached the
coppice at the milking hour. Jon would not take her as far as the
farmyard; only to where she could see the field leading up to the
gardens, and the house beyond. They turned in among the larches,
and suddenly, at the winding of the path, came on Irene, sitting on
an old log seat.</p>

<p>There are various kinds of shocks: to the vertebrae; to the
nerves; to moral sensibility; and, more potent and permanent, to
personal dignity. This last was the shock Jon received, coming thus
on his mother. He became suddenly conscious that he was doing an
indelicate thing. To have brought Fleur down openly&mdash;yes! But
to sneak her in like this! Consumed with shame, he put on a front
as brazen as his nature would permit.</p>

<p>Fleur was smiling, a little defiantly; his mother's startled
face was changing quickly to the impersonal and gracious. It was
she who uttered the first words:</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to see you. It was nice of Jon to think of
bringing you down to us."</p>

<p>"We weren't coming to the house," Jon blurted out. "I just
wanted Fleur to see where I lived."</p>

<p>His mother said quietly:</p>

<p>"Won't you come up and have tea?"</p>

<p>Feeling that he had but aggravated his breach of breeding, he
heard Fleur answer:</p>

<p>"Thanks very much; I have to get back to dinner. I met Jon by
accident, and we thought it would be rather jolly just to see his
home."</p>

<p>How self-possessed she was!</p>

<p>"Of course; but you must have tea. We'll send you down to the
station. My husband will enjoy seeing you."</p>

<p>The expression of his mother's eyes, resting on him for a
moment, cast Jon down level with the ground&mdash;a true worm. Then
she led on, and Fleur followed her. He felt like a child, trailing
after those two, who were talking so easily about Spain and
Wansdon, and the house up there beyond the trees and the grassy
slope. He watched the fencing of their eyes, taking each other
in&mdash;the two beings he loved most in the world.</p>

<p>He could see his father sitting under the oaktree; and suffered
in advance all the loss of caste he must go through in the eyes of
that tranquil figure, with his knees crossed, thin, old, and
elegant; already he could feel the faint irony which would come
into his voice and smile.</p>

<p>"This is Fleur Forsyte, Jolyon; Jon brought her down to see the
house. Let's have tea at once&mdash;she has to catch a train. Jon,
tell them, dear, and telephone to the Dragon for a car."</p>

<p>To leave her alone with them was strange, and yet, as no doubt
his mother had foreseen, the least of evils at the moment; so he
ran up into the house. Now he would not see Fleur alone
again&mdash;not for a minute, and they had arranged no further
meeting! When he returned under cover of the maids and teapots,
there was not a trace of awkwardness beneath the tree; it was all
within himself, but not the less for that. They were talking of the
Gallery off Cork Street.</p>

<p>"We back numbers," his father was saying, "are awfully anxious
to find out why we can't appreciate the new stuff; you and Jon must
tell us."</p>

<p>"It's supposed to be satiric, isn't it?" said Fleur.</p>

<p>He saw his father's smile.</p>

<p>"Satiric? Oh! I think it's more than that. What do you say,
Jon?"</p>

<p>"I don't know at all," stammered Jon. His father's face had a
sudden grimness.</p>

<p>"The young are tired of us, our gods and our ideals. Off with
their heads, they say&mdash;smash their idols! And let's get back
to-nothing! And, by Jove, they've done it! Jon's a poet. He'll be
going in, too, and stamping on what's left of us. Property, beauty,
sentiment&mdash;all smoke. We mustn't own anything nowadays, not
even our feelings. They stand in the way of&mdash;Nothing."</p>

<p>Jon listened, bewildered, almost outraged by his father's words,
behind which he felt a meaning that he could not reach. He didn't
want to stamp on anything!</p>

<p>"Nothing's the god of to-day," continued Jolyon; "we're back
where the Russians were sixty years ago, when they started
Nihilism."</p>

<p>"No, Dad," cried Jon suddenly, "we only want to live, and we
don't know how, because of the Past&mdash;that's all!"</p>

<p>"By George!" said Jolyon, "that's profound, Jon. Is it your own?
The Past! Old ownerships, old passions, and their aftermath. Let's
have cigarettes."</p>

<p>Conscious that his mother had lifted her hand to her lips,
quickly, as if to hush something, Jon handed the cigarettes. He
lighted his father's and Fleur's, then one for himself. Had he
taken the knock that Val had spoken of? The smoke was blue when he
had not puffed, grey when he had; he liked the sensation in his
nose, and the sense of equality it gave him. He was glad no one
said: "So you've begun!" He felt less young.</p>

<p>Fleur looked at her watch, and rose. His mother went with her
into the house. Jon stayed with his father, puffing at the
cigarette.</p>

<p>"See her into the car, old man," said Jolyon; "and when she's
gone, ask your mother to come back to me."</p>

<p>Jon went. He waited in the hall. He saw her into the car. There
was no chance for any word; hardly for a pressure of the hand. He
waited all that evening for something to be said to him. Nothing
was said. Nothing might have happened. He went up to bed, and in
the mirror on his dressing-table met himself. He did not speak, nor
did the image; but both looked as if they thought the more.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV.&mdash;IN GREEN STREET</h3>

<p>Uncertain whether the impression that Prosper Profond was
dangerous should be traced to his attempt to give Val the Mayfly
filly; to a remark of Fleur's: "He's like the hosts of
Midian&mdash;he prowls and prowls around"; to his preposterous
inquiry of Jack Cardigan: "What's the use of keepin' fit?" or, more
simply, to the fact that he was a foreigner, or alien as it was now
called. Certain, that Annette was looking particularly handsome,
and that Soames&mdash;had sold him a Gauguin and then torn up the
cheque, so that Monsieur Profond himself had said: "I didn't get
that small picture I bought from Mr. Forsyde."</p>

<p>However suspiciously regarded, he still frequented Winifred's
evergreen little house in Green Street, with a good-natured
obtuseness which no one mistook for naivete, a word hardly
applicable to Monsieur Prosper Profond. Winifred still found him
"amusing," and would write him little notes saying: "Come and have
a 'jolly' with us"&mdash;it was breath of life to her to keep up
with the phrases of the day.</p>

<p>The mystery, with which all felt him to be surrounded, was due
to his having done, seen, heard, and known everything, and found
nothing in it&mdash;which was unnatural. The English type of
disillusionment was familiar enough to Winifred, who had always
moved in fashionable circles. It gave a certain cachet or
distinction, so that one got something out of it. But to see
nothing in anything, not as a pose, but because there was nothing
in anything, was not English; and that which was not English one
could not help secretly feeling dangerous, if not precisely bad
form. It was like having the mood which the War had left,
seated&mdash;dark, heavy, smiling, indifferent&mdash;in your Empire
chair; it was like listening to that mood talking through thick
pink lips above a little diabolic beard. It was, as Jack Cardigan
expressed it&mdash;for the English character at large&mdash;"a bit
too thick"&mdash;for if nothing was really worth getting excited
about, there were always games, and one could make it so! Even
Winifred, ever a Forsyte at heart, felt that there was nothing to
be had out of such a mood of disillusionment, so that it really
ought not to be there. Monsieur Profond, in fact, made the mood too
plain in a country which decently veiled such realities.</p>

<p>When Fleur, after her hurried return from Robin Hill, came down
to dinner that evening, the mood was standing at the window of
Winifred's little drawing-room, looking out into Green Street, with
an air of seeing nothing in it. And Fleur gazed promptly into the
fireplace with an air of seeing a fire which was not there.</p>

<p>Monsieur Profond came from the window. He was in full fig, with
a white waistcoat and a white flower in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Forsyde," he said, "I'm awful pleased to see you.
Mr. Forsyde well? I was sayin' to-day I want to see him have some
pleasure. He worries."</p>

<p>"You think so?" said Fleur shortly.</p>

<p>"Worries," repeated Monsieur Profond, burring the r's.</p>

<p>Fleur spun round. "Shall I tell you," she said, "what would give
him pleasure?" But the words, "To hear that you had cleared out,"
died at the expression on his face. All his fine white teeth were
showing.</p>

<p>"I was hearin' at the Club to-day about his old trouble." Fleur
opened her eyes. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Profond moved his sleek head as if to minimize his
statement.</p>

<p>"Before you were born," he said; "that small business."</p>

<p>Though conscious that he had cleverly diverted her from his own
share in her father's worry, Fleur was unable to withstand a rush
of nervous curiosity. "Tell me what you heard."</p>

<p>"Why!" murmured Monsieur Profond, "you know all that."</p>

<p>"I expect I do. But I should like to know that you haven't heard
it all wrong."</p>

<p>"His first wife," murmured Monsieur Profond.</p>

<p>Choking back the words, "He was never married before," she said:
"Well, what about her?"</p>

<p>"Mr. George Forsyde was tellin' me about your father's first
wife marryin' his cousin Jolyon afterward. It was a small bit
unpleasant, I should think. I saw their boy&mdash;nice boy!"</p>

<p>Fleur looked up. Monsieur Profond was swimming, heavily
diabolical, before her. That&mdash;the reason! With the most heroic
effort of her life so far, she managed to arrest that swimming
figure. She could not tell whether he had noticed. And just then
Winifred came in.</p>

<p>"Oh! here you both are already; Imogen and I have had the most
amusing afternoon at the Babies' bazaar."</p>

<p>"What babies?" said Fleur mechanically.</p>

<p>"The 'Save the Babies.' I got such a bargain, my dear. A piece
of old Armenian work&mdash;from before the Flood. I want your
opinion on it, Prosper."</p>

<p>"Auntie," whispered Fleur suddenly.</p>

<p>At the tone in the girl's voice Winifred closed in on her.'</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Aren't you well?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Profond had withdrawn into the window, where he was
practically out of hearing.</p>

<p>"Auntie, he-he told me that father has been married before. Is
it true that he divorced her, and she married Jon Forsyte's
father?"</p>

<p>Never in all the life of the mother of four little Darties had
Winifred felt more seriously embarrassed. Her niece's face was so
pale, her eyes so dark, her voice so whispery and strained.</p>

<p>"Your father didn't wish you to hear," she said, with all the
aplomb she could muster. "These things will happen. I've often told
him he ought to let you know."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Fleur, and that was all, but it made Winifred pat her
shoulder&mdash;a firm little shoulder, nice and white! She never
could help an appraising eye and touch in the matter of her niece,
who would have to be married, of course&mdash;though not to that
boy Jon.</p>

<p>"We've forgotten all about it years and years ago," she said
comfortably. "Come and have dinner!"</p>

<p>"No, Auntie. I don't feel very well. May I go upstairs?"</p>

<p>"My dear!" murmured Winifred, concerned, "you're not taking this
to heart? Why, you haven't properly come out yet! That boy's a
child!"</p>

<p>"What boy? I've only got a headache. But I can't stand that man
to-night."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Winifred, "go and lie down. I'll send you
some bromide, and I shall talk to Prosper Profond. What business
had he to gossip? Though I must say I think it's much better you
should know."</p>

<p>Fleur smiled. "Yes," she said, and slipped from the room.</p>

<p>She went up with her head whirling, a dry sensation in her
throat, a guttered frightened feeling in her breast. Never in her
life as yet had she suffered from even momentary fear that she
would not get what she had set her heart on. The sensations of the
afternoon had been full and poignant, and this gruesome discovery
coming on the top of them had really made her head ache. No wonder
her father had hidden that photograph, so secretly behind her
own-ashamed of having kept it! But could he hate Jon's mother and
yet keep her photograph? She pressed her hands over her forehead,
trying to see things clearly. Had they told Jon&mdash;had her visit
to Robin Hill forced them to tell him? Everything now turned on
that! She knew, they all knew, except&mdash;perhaps&mdash;Jon!</p>

<p>She walked up and down, biting her lip and thinking desperately
hard. Jon loved his mother. If they had told him, what would he do?
She could not tell. But if they had not told him, should she
not&mdash;could she not get him for herself&mdash;get married to
him, before he knew? She searched her memories of Robin Hill. His
mother's face so passive&mdash;with its dark eyes and as if
powdered hair, its reserve, its smile&mdash;baffled her; and his
father's&mdash;kindly, sunken, ironic. Instinctively she felt they
would shrink from telling Jon, even now, shrink from hurting
him&mdash;for of course it would hurt him awfully to know!</p>

<p>Her aunt must be made not to tell her father that she knew. So
long as neither she herself nor Jon were supposed to know, there
was still a chance&mdash;freedom to cover one's tracks, and get
what her heart was set on. But she was almost overwhelmed by her
isolation. Every one's hand was against her&mdash;every one's! It
was as Jon had said&mdash;he and she just wanted to live and the
past was in their way, a past they hadn't shared in, and didn't
understand! Oh! What a shame! And suddenly she thought of June.
Would she help them? For somehow June had left on her the
impression that she would be sympathetic with their love, impatient
of obstacle. Then, instinctively, she thought: 'I won't give
anything away, though, even to her. I daren't. I mean to have Jon;
against them all.'</p>

<p>Soup was brought up to her, and one of Winifred's pet headache
cachets. She swallowed both. Then Winifred herself appeared. Fleur
opened her campaign with the words:</p>

<p>"You know, Auntie, I do wish people wouldn't think I'm in love
with that boy. Why, I've hardly seen him!"</p>

<p>Winifred, though experienced, was not "fine." She accepted the
remark with considerable relief. Of course, it was not pleasant for
the girl to hear of the family scandal, and she set herself to
minimise the matter, a task for which she was eminently qualified,
"raised" fashionably under a comfortable mother and a father whose
nerves might not be shaken, and for many years the wife of Montague
Dartie. Her description was a masterpiece of understatement.
Fleur's father's first wife had been very foolish. There had been a
young man who had got run over, and she had left Fleur's father.
Then, years after, when it might all have come&mdash;right again,
she had taken up with their cousin Jolyon; and, of course, her
father had been obliged to have a divorce. Nobody remembered
anything of it now, except just the family. And, perhaps, it had
all turned out for the best; her father had Fleur; and Jolyon and
Irene had been quite happy, they said, and their boy was a nice
boy. "Val having Holly, too, is a sort of plaster, don't you know?"
With these soothing words, Winifred patted her niece's shoulder;
thought: 'She's a nice, plump little thing!' and went back to
Prosper Profond, who, in spite of his indiscretion, was very
"amusing" this evening.</p>

<p>For some minutes after her aunt had gone Fleur remained under
influence of bromide material and spiritual. But then reality came
back. Her aunt had left out all that mattered&mdash;all the
feeling, the hate, the love, the unforgivingness of passionate
hearts. She, who knew so little of life, and had touched only the
fringe of love, was yet aware by instinct that words have as little
relation to fact and feeling as coin to the bread it buys. 'Poor
Father!' she thought. 'Poor me! Poor Jon! But I don't care, I mean
to have him!' From the window of her darkened room she saw "that
man" issue from the door below and "prowl" away. If he and her
mother&mdash;how would that affect her chance? Surely it must make
her father cling to her more closely, so that he would consent in
the end to anything she wanted, or become reconciled the sooner to
what she did without his knowledge.</p>

<p>She took some earth from the flower-box in the window, and with
all her might flung it after that disappearing figure. It fell
short, but the action did her good.</p>

<p>And a little puff of air came up from Green Street, smelling of
petrol, not sweet.</p>

<h3>V.&mdash;PURELY FORSYTE AFFAIRS</h3>

<p>Soames, coming up to the City, with the intention of calling in
at Green Street at the end of his day and taking Fleur back home
with him, suffered from rumination. Sleeping partner that he was,
he seldom visited the City now, but he still had a room of his own
at Cuthcott, Kingson and Forsyte's, and one special clerk and a
half assigned to the management of purely Forsyte affairs. They
were somewhat in flux just now&mdash;an auspicious moment for the
disposal of house property. And Soames was unloading the estates of
his father and Uncle Roger, and to some extent of his Uncle
Nicholas. His shrewd and matter-of-course probity in all money
concerns had made him something of an autocrat in connection with
these trusts. If Soames thought this or thought that, one had
better save oneself the bother of thinking too. He guaranteed, as
it were, irresponsibility to numerous Forsytes of the third and
fourth generations. His fellow trustees, such as his cousins Roger
or Nicholas, his cousins-in-law Tweetyman and Spender, or his
sister Cicely's husband, all trusted him; he signed first, and
where he signed first they signed after, and nobody was a penny the
worse. Just now they were all a good many pennies the better, and
Soames was beginning to see the close of certain trusts, except for
distribution of the income from securities as gilt-edged as was
compatible with the period.</p>

<p>Passing the more feverish parts of the City toward the most
perfect backwater in London, he ruminated. Money was
extraordinarily tight; and morality extraordinarily loose! The War
had done it. Banks were not lending; people breaking contracts all
over the place. There was a feeling in the air and a look on faces
that he did not like. The country seemed in for a spell of gambling
and bankruptcies. There was satisfaction in the thought that
neither he nor his trusts had an investment which could be affected
by anything less maniacal than national repudiation or a levy on
capital. If Soames had faith, it was in what he called "English
common sense"&mdash;or the power to have things, if not one way
then another. He might&mdash;like his father James before
him&mdash;say he didn't know what things were coming to, but he
never in his heart believed they were. If it rested with him, they
wouldn't&mdash;and, after all, he was only an Englishman like any
other, so quietly tenacious of what he had that he knew he would
never really part with it without something more or less equivalent
in exchange. His mind was essentially equilibristic in material
matters, and his way of putting the national situation difficult to
refute in a world composed of human beings. Take his own case, for
example! He was well off. Did that do anybody harm? He did not eat
ten meals a day; he ate no more than, perhaps not so much as, a
poor man. He spent no money on vice; breathed no more air, used no
more water to speak of than the mechanic or the porter. He
certainly had pretty things about him, but they had given
employment in the making, and somebody must use them. He bought
pictures, but Art must be encouraged. He was, in fact, an
accidental channel through which money flowed, employing labour.
What was there objectionable in that? In his charge money was in
quicker and more useful flux than it would be in charge of the
State and a lot of slow-fly money-sucking officials. And as to what
he saved each year&mdash;it was just as much in flux as what he
didn't save, going into Water Board or Council Stocks, or something
sound and useful. The State paid him no salary for being trustee of
his own or other people's money he did all that for nothing.
Therein lay the whole case against nationalisation&mdash;owners of
private property were unpaid, and yet had every incentive to
quicken up the flux. Under nationalisation&mdash;just the opposite!
In a country smarting from officialism he felt that he had a strong
case.</p>

<p>It particularly annoyed him, entering that backwater of perfect
peace, to think that a lot of unscrupulous Trusts and Combinations
had been cornering the market in goods of all kinds, and keeping
prices at an artificial height. Such abusers of the individualistic
system were the ruffians who caused all the trouble, and it was
some satisfaction to see them getting into a stew at fast lest the
whole thing might come down with a run&mdash;and land them in the
soup.</p>

<p>The offices of Cuthcott, Kingson and Forsyte occupied the ground
and first floors of a house on the right-hand side; and, ascending
to his room, Soames thought: 'Time we had a coat of paint.'</p>

<p>His old clerk Gradman was seated, where he always was, at a huge
bureau with countless pigeonholes. Half-the-clerk stood beside him,
with a broker's note recording investment of the proceeds from sale
of the Bryanston Square house, in Roger Forsyte's estate. Soames
took it, and said:</p>

<p>"Vancouver City Stock. H'm. It's down today!"</p>

<p>With a sort of grating ingratiation old Gradman answered
him:</p>

<p>"Ye-es; but everything's down, Mr. Soames." And half-the-clerk
withdrew.</p>

<p>Soames skewered the document on to a number of other papers and
hung up his hat.</p>

<p>"I want to look at my Will and Marriage Settlement,
Gradman."</p>

<p>Old Gradman, moving to the limit of his swivel chair, drew out
two drafts from the bottom lefthand drawer. Recovering his body, he
raised his grizzle-haired face, very red from stooping.</p>

<p>"Copies, Sir."</p>

<p>Soames took them. It struck him suddenly how like Gradman was to
the stout brindled yard dog they had been wont to keep on his chain
at The Shelter, till one day Fleur had come and insisted it should
be let loose, so that it had at once bitten the cook and been
destroyed. If you let Gradman off his chain, would he bite the
cook?</p>

<p>Checking this frivolous fancy, Soames unfolded his Marriage
Settlement. He had not looked at it for over eighteen years, not
since he remade his Will when his father died and Fleur was born.
He wanted to see whether the words "during coverture" were in. Yes,
they were&mdash;odd expression, when you thought of it, and derived
perhaps from horse-breeding! Interest on fifteen thousand pounds
(which he paid her without deducting income tax) so long as she
remained his wife, and afterward during widowhood "dum
casta"&mdash;old-fashioned and rather pointed words, put in to
insure the conduct of Fleur's mother. His Will made it up to an
annuity of a thousand under the same conditions. All right! He
returned the copies to Gradman, who took them without looking up,
swung the chair, restored the papers to their drawer, and went on
casting up.</p>

<p>"Gradman! I don't like the condition of the country; there are a
lot of people about without any common sense. I want to find a way
by which I can safeguard Miss Fleur against anything which might
arise."</p>

<p>Gradman wrote the figure "2" on his blotting-paper.</p>

<p>"Ye-es," he said; "there's a nahsty spirit."</p>

<p>"The ordinary restraint against anticipation doesn't meet the
case."</p>

<p>"Nao," said Gradman.</p>

<p>"Suppose those Labour fellows come in, or worse! It's these
people with fixed ideas who are the danger. Look at Ireland!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Gradman.</p>

<p>"Suppose I were to make a settlement on her at once with myself
as beneficiary for life, they couldn't take anything but the
interest from me, unless of course they alter the law."</p>

<p>Gradman moved his head and smiled.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "they wouldn't do tha-at!"</p>

<p>"I don't know," muttered Soames; "I don't trust them."</p>

<p>"It'll take two years, sir, to be valid against death
duties."</p>

<p>Soames sniffed. Two years! He was only sixty-five!</p>

<p>"That's not the point. Draw a form of settlement that passes all
my property to Miss Fleur's children in equal shares, with
antecedent life-interests first to myself and then to her without
power of anticipation, and add a clause that in the event of
anything happening to divert her life-interest, that interest
passes to the trustees, to apply for her benefit, in their absolute
discretion."</p>

<p>Gradman grated: "Rather extreme at your age, sir; you lose
control."</p>

<p>"That's my business," said Soames sharply.</p>

<p>Gradman wrote on a piece of paper:
"Life-interest&mdash;anticipation&mdash;divert
interest&mdash;absolute discretion..." and said:</p>

<p>"What trustees? There's young Mr. Kingson; he's a nice steady
young fellow."</p>

<p>"Yes, he might do for one. I must have three. There isn't a
Forsyte now who appeals to me."</p>

<p>"Not young Mr. Nicholas? He's at the Bar. We've given 'im
briefs."</p>

<p>"He'll never set the Thames on fire," said Soames.</p>

<p>A smile oozed out on Gradman's face, greasy from countless
mutton-chops, the smile of a man who sits all day.</p>

<p>"You can't expect it, at his age, Mr. Soames."</p>

<p>"Why? What is he? Forty?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es, quite a young fellow."</p>

<p>"Well, put him in; but I want somebody who'll take a personal
interest. There's no one that I can see."</p>

<p>"What about Mr. Valerius, now he's come home?"</p>

<p>"Val Dartie? With that father?"</p>

<p>"We-ell," murmured Gradman, "he's been dead seven
years&mdash;the Statute runs against him."</p>

<p>"No," said Soames. "I don't like the connection." He rose.
Gradman said suddenly:</p>

<p>"If they were makin' a levy on capital, they could come on the
trustees, sir. So there you'd be just the same. I'd think it over,
if I were you."</p>

<p>"That's true," said Soames. "I will. What have you done about
that dilapidation notice in Vere Street?"</p>

<p>"I 'aven't served it yet. The party's very old. She won't want
to go out at her age."</p>

<p>"I don't know. This spirit of unrest touches every one."</p>

<p>"Still, I'm lookin' at things broadly, sir. She's
eighty-one."</p>

<p>"Better serve it," said Soames, "and see what she says. Oh! and
Mr. Timothy? Is everything in order in case of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've got the inventory of his estate all ready; had the
furniture and pictures valued so that we know what reserves to put
on. I shall be sorry when he goes, though. Dear me! It is a time
since I first saw Mr. Timothy!"</p>

<p>"We can't live for ever," said Soames, taking down his hat.</p>

<p>"Nao," said Gradman; "but it'll be a pity&mdash;the last of the
old family! Shall I take up the matter of that nuisance in Old
Compton Street? Those organs&mdash;they're nahsty things."</p>

<p>"Do. I must call for Miss Fleur and catch the four o'clock.
Good-day, Gradman."</p>

<p>"Good-day, Mr. Soames. I hope Miss Fleur&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well enough, but gads about too much."</p>

<p>"Ye-es," grated Gradman; "she's young."</p>

<p>Soames went out, musing: "Old Gradman! If he were younger I'd
put him in the trust. There's nobody I can depend on to take a real
interest."</p>

<p>Leaving the bilious and mathematical exactitude, the
preposterous peace of that backwater, he thought suddenly: 'During
coverture! Why can't they exclude fellows like Profond, instead of
a lot of hard-working Germans?' and was surprised at the depth of
uneasiness which could provoke so unpatriotic a thought. But there
it was! One never got a moment of real peace. There was always
something at the back of everything! And he made his way toward
Green Street.</p>

<p>Two hours later by his watch, Thomas Gradman, stirring in his
swivel chair, closed the last drawer of his bureau, and putting
into his waistcoat pocket a bunch of keys so fat that they gave him
a protuberance on the liver side, brushed his old top hat round
with his sleeve, took his umbrella, and descended. Thick, short,
and buttoned closely into his old frock coat, he walked toward
Covent Garden market. He never missed that daily promenade to the
Tube for Highgate, and seldom some critical transaction on the way
in connection with vegetables and fruit. Generations might be born,
and hats might change, wars be fought, and Forsytes fade away, but
Thomas Gradman, faithful and grey, would take his daily walk and
buy his daily vegetable. Times were not what they were, and his son
had lost a leg, and they never gave him those nice little plaited
baskets to carry the stuff in now, and these Tubes were convenient
things&mdash;still he mustn't complain; his health was good
considering his time of life, and after fifty-four years in the Law
he was getting a round eight hundred a year and a little worried of
late, because it was mostly collector's commission on the rents,
and with all this conversion of Forsyte property going on, it
looked like drying up, and the price of living still so high; but
it was no good worrying&mdash;"The good God made us all"&mdash;as
he was in the habit of saying; still, house property in
London&mdash;he didn't know what Mr. Roger or Mr. James would say
if they could see it being sold like this&mdash;seemed to show a
lack of faith; but Mr. Soames&mdash;he worried. Life and lives in
being and twenty-one years after&mdash;beyond that you couldn't go;
still, he kept his health wonderfully&mdash;and Miss Fleur was a
pretty little thing&mdash;she was; she'd marry; but lots of people
had no children nowadays&mdash;he had had his first child at
twenty-two; and Mr. Jolyon, married while he was at Cambridge, had
his child the same year&mdash;gracious Peter! That was back in '69,
a long time before old Mr. Jolyon&mdash;fine judge of
property&mdash;had taken his Will away from Mr. James&mdash;dear,
yes! Those were the days when they were buyin' property right and
left, and none of this khaki and fallin' over one another to get
out of things; and cucumbers at twopence; and a melon&mdash;the old
melons, that made your mouth water! Fifty years since he went into
Mr. James' office, and Mr. James had said to him: "Now, Gradman,
you're only a shaver&mdash;you pay attention, and you'll make your
five hundred a year before you've done." And he had, and feared
God, and served the Forsytes, and kept a vegetable diet at night.
And, buying a copy of John Bull&mdash;not that he approved of it,
an extravagant affair&mdash;he entered the Tube elevator with his
mere brown-paper parcel, and was borne down into the bowels of the
earth.</p>

<h3>VI.&mdash;SOAMES' PRIVATE LIFE</h3>

<p>On his way to Green Street it occurred to Soames that he ought
to go into Dumetrius' in Suffolk Street about the possibility of
the Bolderby Old Crome. Almost worth while to have fought the war
to have the Bolderby Old Crome, as it were, in flux! Old Bolderby
had died, his son and grandson had been killed&mdash;a cousin was
coming into the estate, who meant to sell it, some said because of
the condition of England, others said because he had asthma.</p>

<p>If Dumetrius once got hold of it the price would become
prohibitive; it was necessary for Soames to find out whether
Dumetrius had got it, before he tried to get it himself. He
therefore confined himself to discussing with Dumetrius whether
Monticellis would come again now that it was the fashion for a
picture to be anything except a picture; and the future of Johns,
with a side-slip into Buxton Knights. It was only when leaving that
he added: "So they're not selling the Bolderby Old Crome, after
all?" In sheer pride of racial superiority, as he had calculated
would be the case, Dumetrius replied:</p>

<p>"Oh! I shall get it, Mr. Forsyte, sir!"</p>

<p>The flutter of his eyelid fortified Soames in a resolution to
write direct to the new Bolderby, suggesting that the only
dignified way of dealing with an Old Crome was to avoid dealers. He
therefore said, "Well, good-day!" and went, leaving Dumetrius the
wiser.</p>

<p>At Green Street he found that Fleur was out and would be all the
evening; she was staying one more night in London. He cabbed on
dejectedly, and caught his train.</p>

<p>He reached his house about six o'clock. The air was heavy,
midges biting, thunder about. Taking his letters he went up to his
dressing-room to cleanse himself of London.</p>

<p>An uninteresting post. A receipt, a bill for purchases on behalf
of Fleur. A circular about an exhibition of etchings. A letter
beginning:</p>

<blockquote>"SIR,<br>
<br>
"I feel it my duty..."</blockquote>

<p>That would be an appeal or something unpleasant. He looked at
once for the signature. There was none! Incredulously he turned the
page over and examined each corner. Not being a public man, Soames
had never yet had an anonymous letter, and his first impulse was to
tear it up, as a dangerous thing; his second to read it, as a thing
still more dangerous.</p>

<blockquote>"SIR,<br>
<br>
"I feel it my duty to inform you that having no interest in the
matter your lady is carrying on with a
foreigner&mdash;"</blockquote>

<p>Reaching that word Soames stopped mechanically and examined the
postmark. So far as he could pierce the impenetrable disguise in
which the Post Office had wrapped it, there was something with a
"sea" at the end and a "t" in it. Chelsea? No! Battersea? Perhaps!
He read on.</p>

<blockquote>"These foreigners are all the same. Sack the lot. This
one meets your lady twice a week. I know it of my own
knowledge&mdash;and to see an Englishman put on goes against the
grain. You watch it and see if what I say isn't true. I shouldn't
meddle if it wasn't a dirty foreigner that's in it.<br>
<br>
"Yours obedient."</blockquote>

<p>The sensation with which Soames dropped the letter was similar
to that he would have had entering his bedroom and finding it full
of black-beetles. The meanness of anonymity gave a shuddering
obscenity to the moment. And the worst of it was that this shadow
had been at the back of his mind ever since the Sunday evening when
Fleur had pointed down at Prosper Profond strolling on the lawn,
and said: "Prowling cat!" Had he not in connection therewith, this
very day, perused his Will and Marriage Settlement? And now this
anonymous ruffian, with nothing to gain, apparently, save the
venting of his spite against foreigners, had wrenched it out of the
obscurity in which he had hoped and wished it would remain. To have
such knowledge forced on him, at his time of life, about Fleur's
mother I He picked the letter up from the carpet, tore it across,
and then, when it hung together by just the fold at the back,
stopped tearing, and reread it. He was taking at that moment one of
the decisive resolutions of his life. He would not be forced into
another scandal. No! However he decided to deal with this
matter&mdash;and it required the most far-sighted and careful
consideration he would do nothing that might injure Fleur. That
resolution taken, his mind answered the helm again, and he made his
ablutions. His hands trembled as he dried them. Scandal he would
not have, but something must be done to stop this sort of thing! He
went into his wife's room and stood looking around him. The idea of
searching for anything which would incriminate, and entitle him to
hold a menace over her, did not even come to him. There would be
nothing&mdash;she was much too practical. The idea of having her
watched had been dismissed before it came&mdash;too well he
remembered his previous experience of that. No! He had nothing but
this torn-up letter from some anonymous ruffian, whose impudent
intrusion into his private life he so violently resented. It was
repugnant to him to make use of it, but he might have to. What a
mercy Fleur was not at home to-night! A tap on the door broke up
his painful cogitations.</p>

<p>"Mr. Michael Mont, sir, is in the drawing-room. Will you see
him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Soames; "yes. I'll come down."</p>

<p>Anything that would take his mind off for a few minutes!</p>

<p>Michael Mont in flannels stood on the verandah smoking a
cigarette. He threw it away as Soames came up, and ran his hand
through his hair.</p>

<p>Soames' feeling toward this young man was singular. He was no
doubt a rackety, irresponsible young fellow according to old
standards, yet somehow likeable, with his extraordinarily cheerful
way of blurting out his opinions.</p>

<p>"Come in," he said; "have you had tea?"</p>

<p>Mont came in.</p>

<p>"I thought Fleur would have been back, sir; but I'm glad she
isn't. The fact is, I&mdash;I'm fearfully gone on her; so fearfully
gone that I thought you'd better know. It's old-fashioned, of
course, coming to fathers first, but I thought you'd forgive that.
I went to my own Dad, and he says if I settle down he'll see me
through. He rather cottons to the idea, in fact. I told him about
your Goya."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Soames, inexpressibly dry. "He rather cottons?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; do you?"</p>

<p>Soames smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"You see," resumed Mont, twiddling his straw hat, while his
hair, ears, eyebrows, all seemed to stand up from excitement, "when
you've been through the War you can't help being in a hurry."</p>

<p>"To get married; and unmarried afterward," said Soames
slowly.</p>

<p>"Not from Fleur, sir. Imagine, if you were me!"</p>

<p>Soames cleared his throat. That way of putting it was forcible
enough.</p>

<p>"Fleur's too young," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, sir. We're awfully old nowadays. My Dad seems to me a
perfect babe; his thinking apparatus hasn't turned a hair. But he's
a Baronight, of course; that keeps him back."</p>

<p>"Baronight," repeated Soames; "what may that be?"</p>

<p>"Bart, sir. I shall be a Bart some day. But I shall live it
down, you know."</p>

<p>"Go away and live this down," said Soames.</p>

<p>Young Mont said imploringly: "Oh! no, sir. I simply must hang
around, or I shouldn't have a dog's chance. You'll let Fleur do
what she likes, I suppose, anyway. Madame passes me."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Soames frigidly.</p>

<p>"You don't really bar me, do you?" and the young man looked so
doleful that Soames smiled.</p>

<p>"You may think you're very old," he said; "but you strike me as
extremely young. To rattle ahead of everything is not a proof of
maturity."</p>

<p>"All right, sir; I give you our age. But to show you I mean
business&mdash;I've got a job."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it."</p>

<p>"Joined a publisher; my governor is putting up the stakes."</p>

<p>Soames put his hand over his mouth&mdash;he had so very nearly
said: "God help the publisher!" His grey eyes scrutinised the
agitated young man.</p>

<p>"I don't dislike you, Mr. Mont, but Fleur is everything to me:
Everything&mdash;do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I know; but so she is to me."</p>

<p>"That's as may be. I'm glad you've told me, however. And now I
think there's nothing more to be said."</p>

<p>"I know it rests with her, sir."</p>

<p>"It will rest with her a long time, I hope."</p>

<p>"You aren't cheering," said Mont suddenly.</p>

<p>"No," said Soames, "my experience of life has not made me
anxious to couple people in a hurry. Good-night, Mr. Mont. I shan't
tell Fleur what you've said."</p>

<p>"Oh!" murmured Mont blankly; "I really could knock my brains out
for want of her. She knows that perfectly well."</p>

<p>"I dare say." And Soames held out his hand. A distracted
squeeze, a heavy sigh, and soon after sounds from the young man's
motor-cycle called up visions of flying dust and broken bones.</p>

<p>'The younger generation!' he thought heavily, and went out on to
the lawn. The gardeners had been mowing, and there was still the
smell of fresh-cut grass&mdash;the thundery air kept all scents
close to earth. The sky was of a purplish hue&mdash;the poplars
black. Two or three boats passed on the river, scuttling, as it
were, for shelter before the storm. 'Three days' fine weather,'
thought Soames, 'and then a storm!' Where was Annette? With that
chap, for all he knew&mdash;she was a young woman! Impressed with
the queer charity of that thought, he entered the summerhouse and
sat down. The fact was&mdash;and he admitted it&mdash;Fleur was so
much to him that his wife was very little&mdash;very little;
French&mdash;had never been much more than a mistress, and he was
getting indifferent to that side of things! It was odd how, with
all this ingrained care for moderation and secure investment,
Soames ever put his emotional eggs into one basket. First
Irene&mdash;now Fleur. He was dimly conscious of it, sitting there,
conscious of its odd dangerousness. It had brought him to wreck and
scandal once, but now&mdash;now it should save him! He cared so
much for Fleur that he would have no further scandal. If only he
could get at that anonymous letter-writer, he would teach him not
to meddle and stir up mud at the bottom of water which he wished
should remain stagnant!...A distant flash, a low rumble, and large
drops of rain spattered on the thatch above him. He remained
indifferent, tracing a pattern with his finger on the dusty surface
of a little rustic table. Fleur's future! 'I want fair sailing for
her,' he thought. 'Nothing else matters at my time of life.' A
lonely business&mdash;life! What you had you never could keep to
yourself! As you warned one off, you let another in. One could make
sure of nothing! He reached up and pulled a red rambler rose from a
cluster which blocked the window. Flowers grew and
dropped&mdash;Nature was a queer thing! The thunder rumbled and
crashed, travelling east along a river, the paling flashes flicked
his eyes; the poplar tops showed sharp and dense against the sky, a
heavy shower rustled and rattled and veiled in the little house
wherein he sat, indifferent, thinking.</p>

<p>When the storm was over, he left his retreat and went down the
wet path to the river bank.</p>

<p>Two swans had come, sheltering in among the reeds. He knew the
birds well, and stood watching the dignity in the curve of those
white necks and formidable snake-like heads. 'Not
dignified&mdash;what I have to do!' he thought. And yet it must be
tackled, lest worse befell. Annette must be back by now from
wherever she had gone, for it was nearly dinner-time, and as the
moment for seeing her approached, the difficulty of knowing what to
say and how to say it had increased. A new and scaring thought
occurred to him. Suppose she wanted her liberty to marry this
fellow! Well, if she did, she couldn't have it. He had not married
her for that. The image of Prosper Profond dawdled before him
reassuringly. Not a marrying man! No, no! Anger replaced that
momentary scare. 'He had better not come my way,' he thought. The
mongrel represented&mdash;! But what did Prosper Profond represent?
Nothing that mattered surely. And yet something real enough in the
world&mdash;unmorality let off its chain, disillusionment on the
prowl! That expression Annette had caught from him: "Je m'en
fiche!" A fatalistic chap! A continental&mdash;a
cosmopolitan&mdash;a product of the age! If there were condemnation
more complete, Soames felt that he did not know it.</p>

<p>The swans had turned their heads, and were looking past him into
some distance of their own. One of them uttered a little hiss,
wagged its tail, turned as if answering to a rudder, and swam away.
The other followed. Their white bodies, their stately necks, passed
out of his sight, and he went toward the house.</p>

<p>Annette was in the drawing-room, dressed for dinner, and he
thought as he went up-stairs 'Handsome is as handsome does.'
Handsome! Except for remarks about the curtains in the
drawing-room, and the storm, there was practically no conversation
during a meal distinguished by exactitude of quantity and
perfection of quality. Soames drank nothing. He followed her into
the drawing-room afterward, and found her smoking a cigarette on
the sofa between the two French windows. She was leaning back,
almost upright, in a low black frock, with her knees crossed and
her blue eyes half-closed; grey-blue smoke issued from her red,
rather full lips, a fillet bound her chestnut hair, she wore the
thinnest silk stockings, and shoes with very high heels showing off
her instep. A fine piece in any room! Soames, who held that torn
letter in a hand thrust deep into the side-pocket of his
dinner-jacket, said:</p>

<p>"I'm going to shut the window; the damp's lifting in."</p>

<p>He did so, and stood looking at a David Cox adorning the
cream-panelled wall close by.</p>

<p>What was she thinking of? He had never understood a woman in his
life&mdash;except Fleur&mdash;and Fleur not always! His heart beat
fast. But if he meant to do it, now was the moment. Turning from
the David Cox, he took out the torn letter.</p>

<p>"I've had this."</p>

<p>Her eyes widened, stared at him, and hardened.</p>

<p>Soames handed her the letter.</p>

<p>"It's torn, but you can read it." And he turned back to the
David Cox&mdash;a sea-piece, of good tone&mdash;but without
movement enough. 'I wonder what that chap's doing at this moment?'
he thought. 'I'll astonish him yet.' Out of the corner of his eye
he saw Annette holding the letter rigidly; her eyes moved from side
to side under her darkened lashes and frowning darkened eyes. She
dropped the letter, gave a little shiver, smiled, and said:</p>

<p>"Dirrty!"</p>

<p>"I quite agree," said Soames; "degrading. Is it true?"</p>

<p>A tooth fastened on her red lower lip. "And what if it
were?"</p>

<p>She was brazen!</p>

<p>"Is that all you have to say?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, speak out!"</p>

<p>"What is the good of talking?"</p>

<p>Soames said icily: "So you admit it?"</p>

<p>"I admit nothing. You are a fool to ask. A man like you should
not ask. It is dangerous."</p>

<p>Soames made a tour of the room, to subdue his rising anger.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," he said, halting in front of her, "what you
were when I married you? Working at accounts in a restaurant."</p>

<p>"Do you remember that I was not half your age?"</p>

<p>Soames broke off the hard encounter of their eyes, and went back
to the David Cox.</p>

<p>"I am not going to bandy words. I require you to give up
this&mdash;friendship. I think of the matter entirely as it affects
Fleur."</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;Fleur!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Soames stubbornly; "Fleur. She is your child as well
as mine."</p>

<p>"It is kind to admit that!"</p>

<p>"Are you going to do what I say?"</p>

<p>"I refuse to tell you."</p>

<p>"Then I must make you."</p>

<p>Annette smiled.</p>

<p>"No, Soames," she said. "You are helpless. Do not say things
that you will regret."</p>

<p>Anger swelled the veins on his forehead. He opened his mouth to
vent that emotion, and could not. Annette went on:</p>

<p>"There shall be no more such letters, I promise you. That is
enough."</p>

<p>Soames writhed. He had a sense of being treated like a child by
this woman who had deserved he did not know what.</p>

<p>"When two people have married, and lived like us, Soames, they
had better be quiet about each other. There are things one does not
drag up into the light for people to laugh at. You will be quiet,
then; not for my sake for your own. You are getting old; I am not,
yet. You have made me ver-ry practical."</p>

<p>Soames, who had passed through all the sensations of being
choked, repeated dully:</p>

<p>"I require you to give up this friendship."</p>

<p>"And if I do not?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then I will cut you out of my Will."</p>

<p>Somehow it did not seem to meet the case. Annette laughed.</p>

<p>"You will live a long time, Soames."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you are a bad woman," said Soames suddenly.</p>

<p>Annette shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I do not think so. Living with you has killed things in me, it
is true; but I am not a bad woman. I am sensible&mdash;that is all.
And so will you be when you have thought it over."</p>

<p>"I shall see this man," said Soames sullenly, "and warn him
off."</p>

<p>"Mon cher, you are funny. You do not want me, you have as much
of me as you want; and you wish the rest of me to be dead. I admit
nothing, but I am not going to be dead, Soames, at my age; so you
had better be quiet, I tell you. I myself will make no scandal;
none. Now, I am not saying any more, whatever you do."</p>

<p>She reached out, took a French novel off a little table, and
opened it. Soames watched her, silenced by the tumult of his
feelings. The thought of that man was almost making him want her,
and this was a revelation of their relationship, startling to one
little given to introspective philosophy. Without saying another
word he went out and up to the picture-gallery. This came of
marrying a Frenchwoman! And yet, without her there would have been
no Fleur! She had served her purpose.</p>

<p>'She's right,' he thought; 'I can do nothing. I don't even know
that there's anything in it.' The instinct of self-preservation
warned him to batten down his hatches, to smother the fire with
want of air. Unless one believed there was something in a thing,
there wasn't.</p>

<p>That night he went into her room. She received him in the most
matter-of-fact way, as if there had been no scene between them. And
he returned to his own room with a curious sense of peace. If one
didn't choose to see, one needn't. And he did not choose&mdash;in
future he did not choose. There was nothing to be gained by
it&mdash;nothing! Opening the drawer he took from the sachet a
handkerchief, and the framed photograph of Fleur. When he had
looked at it a little he slipped it down, and there was that other
one&mdash;that old one of Irene. An owl hooted while he stood in
his window gazing at it. The owl hooted, the red climbing roses
seemed to deepen in colour, there came a scent of lime-blossom.
God! That had been a different thing! Passion&mdash;Memory!
Dust!</p>

<h3>VII.&mdash;JUNE TAKES A HAND</h3>

<p>One who was a sculptor, a Slav, a sometime resident in New York,
an egoist, and impecunious, was to be found of an evening in June
Forsyte's studio on the bank of the Thames at Chiswick. On the
evening of July 6, Boris Strumolowski&mdash;several of whose works
were on show there because they were as yet too advanced to be on
show anywhere else&mdash;had begun well, with that aloof and rather
Christ-like silence which admirably suited his youthful, round,
broad cheek-boned countenance framed in bright hair banged like a
girl's. June had known him three weeks, and he still seemed to her
the principal embodiment of genius, and hope of the future; a sort
of Star of the East which had strayed into an unappreciative West.
Until that evening he had conversationally confined himself to
recording his impressions of the United States, whose dust he had
just shaken from off his feet&mdash;a country, in his opinion, so
barbarous in every way that he had sold practically nothing there,
and become an object of suspicion to the police; a country, as he
said, without a race of its own, without liberty, equality, or
fraternity, without principles, traditions, taste, without&mdash;in
a word&mdash;a soul. He had left it for his own good, and come to
the only other country where he could live well. June had dwelt
unhappily on him in her lonely moments, standing before his
creations&mdash;frightening, but powerful and symbolic once they
had been explained! That he, haloed by bright hair like an early
Italian painting, and absorbed in his genius to the exclusion of
all else&mdash;the only sign of course by which real genius could
be told&mdash;should still be a "lame duck" agitated her warm heart
almost to the exclusion of Paul Post. And she had begun to take
steps to clear her Gallery, in order to fill it with Strumolowski
masterpieces. She had at once encountered trouble. Paul Post had
kicked; Vospovitch had stung. With all the emphasis of a genius
which she did not as yet deny them, they had demanded another six
weeks at least of her Gallery. The American stream, still flowing
in, would soon be flowing out. The American stream was their right,
their only hope, their salvation&mdash;since nobody in this
"beastly" country cared for Art. June had yielded to the
demonstration. After all Boris would not mind their having the full
benefit of an American stream, which he himself so violently
despised.</p>

<p>This evening she had put that to Boris with nobody else present,
except Hannah Hobdey, the mediaeval black-and-whitist, and Jimmy
Portugal, editor of the Neo-Artist. She had put it to him with that
sudden confidence which continual contact with the neo-artistic
world had never been able to dry up in her warm and generous
nature. He had not broken his Christ-like silence, however, for
more than two minutes before she began to move her blue eyes from
side to side, as a cat moves its tail. This&mdash;he said&mdash;was
characteristic of England, the most selfish country in the world;
the country which sucked the blood of other countries; destroyed
the brains and hearts of Irishmen, Hindus, Egyptians, Boers, and
Burmese, all the best races in the world; bullying, hypocritical
England! This was what he had expected, coming to, such a country,
where the climate was all fog, and the people all tradesmen
perfectly blind to Art, and sunk in profiteering and the grossest
materialism. Conscious that Hannah Hobdey was murmuring, "Hear,
hear!" and Jimmy Portugal sniggering, June grew crimson, and
suddenly rapped out:</p>

<p>"Then why did you ever come? We didn't ask you."</p>

<p>The remark was so singularly at variance with all she had led
him to expect from her, that Strumolowski stretched out his hand
and took a cigarette.</p>

<p>"England never wants an idealist," he said.</p>

<p>But in June something primitively English was thoroughly upset;
old Jolyon's sense of justice had risen, as it were, from bed. "You
come and sponge on us," she said, "and then abuse us. If you think
that's playing the game, I don't."</p>

<p>She now discovered that which others had discovered before
her&mdash;the thickness of hide beneath which the sensibility of
genius is sometimes veiled. Strumolowski's young and ingenuous face
became the incarnation of a sneer.</p>

<p>"Sponge, one does not sponge, one takes what is owing&mdash;a
tenth part of what is owing. You will repent to say that, Miss
Forsyte."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said June, "I shan't."</p>

<p>"Ah! We know very well, we artists&mdash;you take us to get what
you can out of us. I want nothing from you"&mdash;and he blew out a
cloud of June's smoke.</p>

<p>Decision rose in an icy puff from the turmoil of insulted shame
within her. "Very well, then, you can take your things away."</p>

<p>And, almost in the same moment, she thought: 'Poor boy! He's
only got a garret, and probably not a taxi fare. In front of these
people, too; it's positively disgusting!'</p>

<p>Young Strumolowski shook his head violently; his hair, thick,
smooth, close as a golden plate, did not fall off.</p>

<p>"I can live on nothing," he said shrilly; "I have often had to
for the sake of my Art. It is you bourgeois who force us to spend
money."</p>

<p>The words hit June like a pebble, in the ribs. After all she had
done for Art, all her identification with its troubles and lame
ducks. She was struggling for adequate words when the door was
opened, and her Austrian murmured:</p>

<p>"A young lady, gnadiges Fraulein."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In the little meal-room."</p>

<p>With a glance at Boris Strumolowski, at Hannah Hobdey, at Jimmy
Portugal, June said nothing, and went out, devoid of equanimity.
Entering the "little meal-room," she perceived the young lady to be
Fleur&mdash;looking very pretty, if pale. At this disenchanted
moment a little lame duck of her own breed was welcome to June, so
homoeopathic by instinct.</p>

<p>The girl must have come, of course, because of Jon; or, if not,
at least to get something out of her. And June felt just then that
to assist somebody was the only bearable thing.</p>

<p>"So you've remembered to come," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes. What a jolly little duck of a house! But please don't let
me bother you, if you've got people."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said June. "I want to let them stew in their own
juice for a bit. Have you come about Jon?"</p>

<p>"You said you thought we ought to be told. Well, I've found
out."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said June blankly. "Not nice, is it?"</p>

<p>They were standing one on each side of the little bare table at
which June took her meals. A vase on it was full of Iceland
poppies; the girl raised her hand and touched them with a gloved
finger. To her new-fangled dress, frilly about the hips and tight
below the knees, June took a sudden liking&mdash;a charming colour,
flax-blue.</p>

<p>'She makes a picture,' thought June. Her little room, with its
whitewashed walls, its floor and hearth of old pink brick, its
black paint, and latticed window athwart which the last of the
sunlight was shining, had never looked so charming, set off by this
young figure, with the creamy, slightly frowning face. She
remembered with sudden vividness how nice she herself had looked in
those old days when her heart was set on Philip Bosinney, that dead
lover, who had broken from her to destroy for ever Irene's
allegiance to this girl's father. Did Fleur know of that, too?</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>It was some seconds before Fleur answered.</p>

<p>"I don't want Jon to suffer. I must see him once more to put an
end to it."</p>

<p>"You're going to put an end to it!"</p>

<p>"What else is there to do?"</p>

<p>The girl seemed to June, suddenly, intolerably spiritless.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're right," she muttered. "I know my father thinks
so; but&mdash;I should never have done it myself. I can't take
things lying down."</p>

<p>How poised and watchful that girl looked; how unemotional her
voice sounded!</p>

<p>"People will assume that I'm in love."</p>

<p>"Well, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Fleur shrugged her shoulders. 'I might have known it,' thought
June; 'she's Soames' daughter&mdash;fish! And yet&mdash;he!'</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do then?" she said with a sort of
disgust.</p>

<p>"Could I see Jon here to-morrow on his way down to Holly's? He'd
come if you sent him a line to-night. And perhaps afterward you'd
let them know quietly at Robin Hill that it's all over, and that
they needn't tell Jon about his mother."</p>

<p>"All right!" said June abruptly. "I'll write now, and you can
post it. Half-past two tomorrow. I shan't be in, myself."</p>

<p>She sat down at the tiny bureau which filled one corner. When
she looked round with the finished note Fleur was still touching
the poppies with her gloved finger.</p>

<p>June licked a stamp. "Well, here it is. If you're not in love,
of course, there's no more to be said. Jon's lucky."</p>

<p>Fleur took the note. "Thanks awfully!"</p>

<p>'Cold-blooded little baggage!' thought June. Jon, son of her
father, to love, and not to be loved by the daughter
of&mdash;Soames! It was humiliating!</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>Fleur nodded; her frills shook and trembled as she swayed toward
the door.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye!...Little piece of fashion!" muttered June, closing
the door. "That family!" And she marched back toward her studio.
Boris Strumolowski had regained his Christ-like silence and Jimmy
Portugal was damning everybody, except the group in whose behalf he
ran the Neo-Artist. Among the condemned were Eric Cobbley, and
several other "lame-duck" genii who at one time or another had held
first place in the repertoire of June's aid and adoration. She
experienced a sense of futility and disgust, and went to the window
to let the river-wind blow those squeaky words away.</p>

<p>But when at length Jimmy Portugal had finished, and gone with
Hannah Hobdey, she sat down and mothered young Strumolowski for
half an hour, promising him a month, at least, of the American
stream; so that he went away with his halo in perfect order. 'In
spite of all,' June thought, 'Boris is wonderful.'</p>

<hr>

<h3>VIII.&mdash;THE BIT BETWEEN THE TEETH</h3>

<p>To know that your hand is against every one's is&mdash;for some
natures&mdash;to experience a sense of moral release. Fleur felt no
remorse when she left June's house. Reading condemnatory resentment
in her little kinswoman's blue eyes-she was glad that she had
fooled her, despising June because that elderly idealist had not
seen what she was after.</p>

<p>End it, forsooth! She would soon show them all that she was only
just beginning. And she smiled to herself on the top of the bus
which carried her back to Mayfair. But the smile died, squeezed out
by spasms of anticipation and anxiety. Would she be able to manage
Jon? She had taken the bit between her teeth, but could she make
him take it too? She knew the truth and the real danger of
delay&mdash;he knew neither; therein lay all the difference in the
world.</p>

<p>'Suppose I tell him,' she thought; 'wouldn't it really be
safer?' This hideous luck had no right to spoil their love; he must
see that! They could not let it! People always accepted an
accomplished fact in time! From that piece of
philosophy&mdash;profound enough at her age&mdash;she passed to
another consideration less philosophic. If she persuaded Jon to a
quick and secret marriage, and he found out afterward that she had
known the truth. What then? Jon hated subterfuge. Again, then,
would it not be better to tell him? But the memory of his mother's
face kept intruding on that impulse. Fleur was afraid. His mother
had power over him; more power perhaps than she herself. Who could
tell? It was too great a risk. Deep-sunk in these instinctive
calculations she was carried on past Green Street as far as the
Ritz Hotel. She got down there, and walked back on the Green Park
side. The storm had washed every tree; they still dripped. Heavy
drops fell on to her frills, and to avoid them she crossed over
under the eyes of the Iseeum Club. Chancing to look up she saw
Monsieur Profond with a tall stout man in the bay window. Turning
into Green Street she heard her name called, and saw "that prowler"
coming up. He took off his hat&mdash;a glossy "bowler" such as she
particularly detested.</p>

<p>"Good evenin'! Miss Forsyde. Isn't there a small thing I can do
for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, pass by on the other side."</p>

<p>"I say! Why do you dislike me?"</p>

<p>"Do I?"</p>

<p>"It looks like it."</p>

<p>"Well, then, because you make me feel life isn't worth
living."</p>

<p>Monsieur Profond smiled.</p>

<p>"Look here, Miss Forsyde, don't worry. It'll be all right.
Nothing lasts."</p>

<p>"Things do last," cried Fleur; "with me anyhow&mdash;especially
likes and dislikes."</p>

<p>"Well, that makes me a bit un'appy."</p>

<p>"I should have thought nothing could ever make you happy or
unhappy."</p>

<p>"I don't like to annoy other people. I'm goin' on my yacht."</p>

<p>Fleur looked at him, startled.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Small voyage to the South Seas or somewhere," said Monsieur
Profond.</p>

<p>Fleur suffered relief and a sense of insult. Clearly he meant to
convey that he was breaking with her mother. How dared he have
anything to break, and yet how dared he break it?</p>

<p>"Good-night, Miss Forsyde! Remember me to Mrs. Dartie. I'm not
so bad really. Good-night!" Fleur left him standing there with his
hat raised. Stealing a look round, she saw him
stroll&mdash;immaculate and heavy&mdash;back toward his Club.</p>

<p>'He can't even love with conviction,' she thought. 'What will
Mother do?'</p>

<p>Her dreams that night were endless and uneasy; she rose heavy
and unrested, and went at once to the study of Whitaker's Almanac.
A Forsyte is instinctively aware that facts are the real crux of
any situation. She might conquer Jon's prejudice, but without exact
machinery to complete their desperate resolve, nothing would
happen. From the invaluable tome she learned that they must each be
twenty-one; or some one's consent would be necessary, which of
course was unobtainable; then she became lost in directions
concerning licenses, certificates, notices, districts, coming
finally to the word "perjury." But that was nonsense! Who would
really mind their giving wrong ages in order to be married for
love! She ate hardly any breakfast, and went back to Whitaker. The
more she studied the less sure she became; till, idly turning the
pages, she came to Scotland. People could be married there without
any of this nonsense. She had only to go and stay there twenty-one
days, then Jon could come, and in front of two people they could
declare themselves married. And what was more&mdash;they would be!
It was far the best way; and at once she ran over her
schoolfellows. There was Mary Lambe who lived in Edinburgh and was
"quite a sport!"</p>

<p>She had a brother too. She could stay with Mary Lambe, who with
her brother would serve for witnesses. She well knew that some
girls would think all this unnecessary, and that all she and Jon
need do was to go away together for a weekend and then say to their
people: "We are married by Nature, we must now be married by Law."
But Fleur was Forsyte enough to feel such a proceeding dubious, and
to dread her father's face when he heard of it. Besides, she did
not believe that Jon would do it; he had an opinion of her such as
she could not bear to diminish. No! Mary Lambe was preferable, and
it was just the time of year to go to Scotland. More at ease now
she packed, avoided her aunt, and took a bus to Chiswick. She was
too early, and went on to Kew Gardens. She found no peace among its
flower-beds, labelled trees, and broad green spaces, and having
lunched off anchovy-paste sandwiches and coffee, returned to
Chiswick and rang June's bell. The Austrian admitted her to the
"little meal-room." Now that she knew what she and Jon were up
against, her longing for him had increased tenfold, as if he were a
toy with sharp edges or dangerous paint such as they had tried to
take from her as a child. If she could not have her way, and get
Jon for good and all, she felt like dying of privation. By hook or
crook she must and would get him! A round dim mirror of very old
glass hung over the pink brick hearth. She stood looking at herself
reflected in it, pale, and rather dark under the eyes; little
shudders kept passing through her nerves. Then she heard the bell
ring, and, stealing to the window, saw him standing on the doorstep
smoothing his hair and lips, as if he too were trying to subdue the
fluttering of his nerves.</p>

<p>She was sitting on one of the two rush-seated chairs, with her
back to the door, when he came in, and she said at once&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sit down, Jon, I want to talk seriously."</p>

<p>Jon sat on the table by her side, and without looking at him she
went on:</p>

<p>"If you don't want to lose me, we must get married."</p>

<p>Jon gasped.</p>

<p>"Why? Is there anything new?"</p>

<p>"No, but I felt it at Robin Hill, and among my people."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" stammered Jon, "at Robin Hill&mdash;it was all
smooth&mdash;and they've said nothing to me."</p>

<p>"But they mean to stop us. Your mother's face was enough. And my
father's."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him since?"</p>

<p>Fleur nodded. What mattered a few supplementary lies?</p>

<p>"But," said Jon eagerly, "I can't see how they can feel like
that after all these years."</p>

<p>Fleur looked up at him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't love me enough."</p>

<p>"Not love you enough! Why&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Then make sure of me."</p>

<p>"Without telling them?"</p>

<p>"Not till after."</p>

<p>Jon was silent. How much older he looked than on that day,
barely two months ago, when she first saw him&mdash;quite two years
older!</p>

<p>"It would hurt Mother awfully," he said.</p>

<p>Fleur drew her hand away.</p>

<p>"You've got to choose."</p>

<p>Jon slid off the table on to his knees.</p>

<p>"But why not tell them? They can't really stop us, Fleur!"</p>

<p>"They can! I tell you, they can."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"We're utterly dependent&mdash;by putting money pressure, and
all sorts of other pressure. I'm not patient, Jon."</p>

<p>"But it's deceiving them."</p>

<p>Fleur got up.</p>

<p>"You can't really love me, or you wouldn't hesitate. 'He either
fears his fate too much!'"</p>

<p>Lifting his hands to her waist, Jon forced her to sit down
again. She hurried on:</p>

<p>"I've planned it all out. We've only to go to Scotland. When
we're married they'll soon come round. People always come round to
facts. Don't you see, Jon?"</p>

<p>"But to hurt them so awfully!"</p>

<p>So he would rather hurt her than those people of his! "All
right, then; let me go!"</p>

<p>Jon got up and put his back against the door.</p>

<p>"I expect you're right," he said slowly; "but I want to think it
over."</p>

<p>She could see that he was seething with feelings he wanted to
express; but she did not mean to help him. She hated herself at
this moment and almost hated him. Why had she to do all the work to
secure their love? It wasn't fair. And then she saw his eyes,
adoring and distressed.</p>

<p>"Don't look like that! I only don't want to lose you, Jon."</p>

<p>"You can't lose me so long as you want me."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I can."</p>

<p>Jon put his hands on her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Fleur, do you know anything you haven't told me?"</p>

<p>It was the point-blank question she had dreaded. She looked
straight at him, and answered: "No." She had burnt her boats; but
what did it matter, if she got him? He would forgive her. And
throwing her arms round his neck, she kissed him on the lips. She
was winning! She felt it in the beating of his heart against her,
in the closing of his eyes. "I want to make sure! I want to make
sure!" she whispered. "Promise!"</p>

<p>Jon did not answer. His face had the stillness of extreme
trouble. At last he said:</p>

<p>"It's like hitting them. I must think a little, Fleur. I really
must."</p>

<p>Fleur slipped out of his arms.</p>

<p>"Oh! Very well!" And suddenly she burst into tears of
disappointment, shame, and overstrain. Followed five minutes of
acute misery. Jon's remorse and tenderness knew no bounds; but he
did not promise. Despite her will to cry, "Very well, then, if you
don't love me enough-goodbye!" she dared not. From birth accustomed
to her own way, this check from one so young, so tender, so
devoted, baffled and surprised her. She wanted to push him away
from her, to try what anger and coldness would do, and again she
dared not. The knowledge that she was scheming to rush him
blindfold into the irrevocable weakened everything&mdash;weakened
the sincerity of pique, and the sincerity of passion; even her
kisses had not the lure she wished for them. That stormy little
meeting ended inconclusively.</p>

<p>"Will you some tea, gnadiges Fraulein?"</p>

<p>Pushing Jon from her, she cried out:</p>

<p>"No-no, thank you! I'm just going."</p>

<p>And before he could prevent her she was gone.</p>

<p>She went stealthily, mopping her gushed, stained cheeks,
frightened, angry, very miserable. She had stirred Jon up so
fearfully, yet nothing definite was promised or arranged! But the
more uncertain and hazardous the future, the more "the will to
have" worked its tentacles into the flesh of her heart&mdash;like
some burrowing tick!</p>

<p>No one was at Green Street. Winifred had gone with Imogen to see
a play which some said was allegorical, and others "very exciting,
don't you know." It was because of what others said that Winifred
and Imogen had gone. Fleur went on to Paddington. Through the
carriage the air from the brick-kilns of West Drayton and the late
hayfields fanned her still gushed cheeks. Flowers had seemed to be
had for the picking; now they were all thorned and prickled. But
the golden flower within the crown of spikes seemed to her
tenacious spirit all the fairer and more desirable.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IX.&mdash;THE FAT IN THE FIRE</h3>

<p>On reaching home Fleur found an atmosphere so peculiar that it
penetrated even the perplexed aura of her own private life. Her
mother was inaccessibly entrenched in a brown study; her father
contemplating fate in the vinery. Neither of them had a word to
throw to a dog. 'Is it because of me?' thought Fleur. 'Or because
of Profond?' To her mother she said:</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Father?"</p>

<p>Her mother answered with a shrug of her shoulders.</p>

<p>To her father:</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Mother?"</p>

<p>Her father answered:</p>

<p>"Matter? What should be the matter?" and gave her a sharp
look.</p>

<p>"By the way," murmured Fleur, "Monsieur Profond is going a
'small' voyage on his yacht, to the South Seas."</p>

<p>Soames examined a branch on which no grapes were growing.</p>

<p>"This vine's a failure," he said. "I've had young Mont here. He
asked me something about you."</p>

<p>"Oh! How do you like him, Father?"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he's a product&mdash;like all these young people."</p>

<p>"What were you at his age, dear?"</p>

<p>Soames smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"We went to work, and didn't play about&mdash;flying and
motoring, and making love."</p>

<p>"Didn't you ever make love?"</p>

<p>She avoided looking at him while she said that, but she saw him
well enough. His pale face had reddened, his eyebrows, where
darkness was still mingled with the grey, had come close
together.</p>

<p>"I had no time or inclination to philander."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had a grand passion."</p>

<p>Soames looked at her intently.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if you want to know&mdash;and much good it did me."
He moved away, along by the hot-water pipes. Fleur tiptoed silently
after him.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it, Father!"</p>

<p>Soames became very still.</p>

<p>"What should you want to know about such things, at your
age?"</p>

<p>"Is she alive?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"And married?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It's Jon Forsyte's mother, isn't it? And she was your wife
first."</p>

<p>It was said in a flash of intuition. Surely his opposition came
from his anxiety that she should not know of that old wound to his
pride. But she was startled. To see some one so old and calm wince
as if struck, to hear so sharp a note of pain in his voice!</p>

<p>"Who told you that? If your aunt! I can't bear the affair talked
of."</p>

<p>"But, darling," said Fleur, softly, "it's so long ago."</p>

<p>"Long ago or not, I..."</p>

<p>Fleur stood stroking his arm.</p>

<p>"I've tried to forget," he said suddenly; "I don't wish to be
reminded." And then, as if venting some long and secret irritation,
he added: "In these days people don't understand. Grand passion,
indeed! No one knows what it is."</p>

<p>"I do," said Fleur, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>Soames, who had turned his back on her, spun round.</p>

<p>"What are you talking of&mdash;a child like you!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I've inherited it, Father."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"For her son, you see."</p>

<p>He was pale as a sheet, and she knew that she was as bad. They
stood staring at each other in the steamy heat, redolent of the
mushy scent of earth, of potted geranium, and of vines coming along
fast.</p>

<p>"This is crazy," said Soames at last, between dry lips.</p>

<p>Scarcely moving her own, she murmured:</p>

<p>"Don't be angry, Father. I can't help it."</p>

<p>But she could see he wasn't angry; only scared, deeply
scared.</p>

<p>"I thought that foolishness," he stammered, "was all
forgotten."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! It's ten times what it was."</p>

<p>Soames kicked at the hot-water pipe. The hapless movement
touched her, who had no fear of her father&mdash;none.</p>

<p>"Dearest!" she said. "What must be, must, you know."</p>

<p>"Must!" repeated Soames. "You don't know what you're talking of.
Has that boy been told?"</p>

<p>The blood rushed into her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>He had turned from her again, and, with one shoulder a little
raised, stood staring fixedly at a joint in the pipes.</p>

<p>"It's most distasteful to me," he said suddenly; "nothing could
be more so. Son of that fellow!
It's&mdash;it's&mdash;perverse!"</p>

<p>She had noted, almost unconsciously, that he did not say "son of
that woman," and again her intuition began working.</p>

<p>Did the ghost of that grand passion linger in some corner of his
heart?</p>

<p>She slipped her hand under his arm.</p>

<p>"Jon's father is quite ill and old; I saw him."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I went there with Jon; I saw them both."</p>

<p>"Well, and what did they say to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. They were very polite."</p>

<p>"They would be." He resumed his contemplation of the pipe-joint,
and then said suddenly:</p>

<p>"I must think this over&mdash;I'll speak to you again
to-night."</p>

<p>She knew this was final for the moment, and stole away, leaving
him still looking at the pipe-joint. She wandered into the
fruit-garden, among the raspberry and currant bushes, without
impetus to pick and eat. Two months ago&mdash;she was
light-hearted! Even two days ago&mdash;light-hearted, before
Prosper Profond told her. Now she felt tangled in a web-of
passions, vested rights, oppressions and revolts, the ties of love
and hate. At this dark moment of discouragement there seemed, even
to her hold-fast nature, no way out. How deal with it&mdash;how
sway and bend things to her will, and get her heart's desire? And,
suddenly, round the corner of the high box hedge, she came plump on
her mother, walking swiftly, with an open letter in her hand. Her
bosom was heaving, her eyes dilated, her cheeks flushed. Instantly
Fleur thought: 'The yacht! Poor Mother!'</p>

<p>Annette gave her a wide startled look, and said:</p>

<p>"J'ai la migraine."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry, Mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! you and your father&mdash;sorry!"</p>

<p>"But, Mother&mdash;I am. I know what it feels like."</p>

<p>Annette's startled eyes grew wide, till the whites showed above
them.</p>

<p>"Poor innocent!" she said.</p>

<p>Her mother&mdash;so self-possessed, and commonsensical&mdash;to
look and speak like this! It was all frightening! Her father, her
mother, herself! And only two months back they had seemed to have
everything they wanted in this world.</p>

<p>Annette crumpled the letter in her hand. Fleur knew that she
must ignore the sight.</p>

<p>"Can't I do anything for your head, Mother?"</p>

<p>Annette shook that head and walked on, swaying her hips.</p>

<p>'It's cruel,' thought Fleur, 'and I was glad! That man! What do
men come prowling for, disturbing everything! I suppose he's tired
of her. What business has he to be tired of my mother? What
business!' And at that thought, so natural and so peculiar, she
uttered a little choked laugh.</p>

<p>She ought, of course, to be delighted, but what was there to be
delighted at? Her father didn't really care! Her mother did,
perhaps? She entered the orchard, and sat down under a cherry-tree.
A breeze sighed in the higher boughs; the sky seen through their
green was very blue and very white in cloud&mdash;those heavy white
clouds almost always present in river landscape. Bees, sheltering
out of the wind, hummed softly, and over the lush grass fell the
thick shade from those fruit-trees planted by her father
five-and-twenty, years ago. Birds were almost silent, the cuckoos
had ceased to sing, but wood-pigeons were cooing. The breath and
drone and cooing of high summer were not for long a sedative to her
excited nerves. Crouched over her knees she began to scheme. Her
father must be made to back her up. Why should he mind so long as
she was happy? She had not lived for nearly nineteen years without
knowing that her future was all he really cared about. She had,
then, only to convince him that her future could not be happy
without Jon. He thought it a mad fancy. How foolish the old were,
thinking they could tell what the young felt! Had not he confessed
that he&mdash;when young&mdash;had loved with a grand passion? He
ought to understand! 'He piles up his money for me,' she thought;
'but what's the use, if I'm not going to be happy?' Money, and all
it bought, did not bring happiness. Love only brought that. The
ox-eyed daisies in this orchard, which gave it such a moony look
sometimes, grew wild and happy, and had their hour. 'They oughtn't
to have called me Fleur,' she mused, 'if they didn't mean me to
have my hour, and be happy while it lasts.' Nothing real stood in
the way, like poverty, or disease&mdash;sentiment only, a ghost
from the unhappy past! Jon was right. They wouldn't let you live,
these old people! They made mistakes, committed crimes, and wanted
their children to go on paying! The breeze died away; midges began
to bite. She got up, plucked a piece of honeysuckle, and went
in.</p>

<p>It was hot that night. Both she and her mother had put on thin,
pale low frocks. The dinner flowers were pale. Fleur was struck
with the pale look of everything; her father's face, her mother's
shoulders; the pale panelled walls, the pale grey velvety carpet,
the lamp-shade, even the soup was pale. There was not one spot of
colour in the room, not even wine in the pale glasses, for no one
drank it. What was not pale was black&mdash;her father's clothes,
the butler's clothes, her retriever stretched out exhausted in the
window, the curtains black with a cream pattern. A moth came in,
and that was pale. And silent was that half-mourning dinner in the
heat.</p>

<p>Her father called her back as she was following her mother
out.</p>

<p>She sat down beside him at the table, and, unpinning the pale
honeysuckle, put it to her nose.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear?"</p>

<p>"It's extremely painful for me to talk, but there's no help for
it. I don't know if you understand how much you are to me I've
never spoken of it, I didn't think it necessary; but&mdash;but
you're everything. Your mother&mdash;" he paused, staring at his
finger-bowl of Venetian glass.</p>

<p>"Yes?"'</p>

<p>"I've only you to look to. I've never had&mdash;never wanted
anything else, since you were born."</p>

<p>"I know," Fleur murmured.</p>

<p>Soames moistened his lips.</p>

<p>"You may think this a matter I can smooth over and arrange for
you. You're mistaken. I'm helpless."</p>

<p>Fleur did not speak.</p>

<p>"Quite apart from my own feelings," went on Soames with more
resolution, "those two are not amenable to anything I can say.
They&mdash;they hate me, as people always hate those whom they have
injured."</p>

<p>"But he&mdash;Jon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's their flesh and blood, her only child. Probably he means
to her what you mean to me. It's a deadlock."</p>

<p>"No," cried Fleur, "no, Father!"</p>

<p>Soames leaned back, the image of pale patience, as if resolved
on the betrayal of no emotion.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he said. "You're putting the feelings of two
months&mdash;two months&mdash;against the feelings of thirty-five
years! What chance do you think you have? Two months&mdash;your
very first love affair, a matter of half a dozen meetings, a few
walks and talks, a few kisses&mdash;against, against what you can't
imagine, what no one could who hasn't been through it. Come, be
reasonable, Fleur! It's midsummer madness!"</p>

<p>Fleur tore the honeysuckle into little, slow bits.</p>

<p>"The madness is in letting the past spoil it all.</p>

<p>"What do we care about the past? It's our lives, not yours."</p>

<p>Soames raised his hand to his forehead, where suddenly she saw
moisture shining.</p>

<p>"Whose child are you?" he said. "Whose child is he? The present
is linked with the past, the future with both. There's no getting
away from that."</p>

<p>She had never heard philosophy pass those lips before. Impressed
even in her agitation, she leaned her elbows on the table, her chin
on her hands.</p>

<p>"But, Father, consider it practically. We want each other.
There's ever so much money, and nothing whatever in the way but
sentiment. Let's bury the past, Father."</p>

<p>His answer was a sigh.</p>

<p>"Besides," said Fleur gently, "you can't prevent us."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose," said Soames, "that if left to myself I should
try to prevent you; I must put up with things, I know, to keep your
affection. But it's not I who control this matter. That's what I
want you to realise before it's too late. If you go on thinking you
can get your way and encourage this feeling, the blow will be much
heavier when you find you can't."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Fleur, "help me, Father; you can help me, you
know."</p>

<p>Soames made a startled movement of negation. "I?" he said
bitterly. "Help? I am the impediment&mdash;the just cause and
impediment&mdash;isn't that the jargon? You have my blood in your
veins."</p>

<p>He rose.</p>

<p>"Well, the fat's in the fire. If you persist in your wilfulness
you'll have yourself to blame. Come! Don't be foolish, my
child&mdash;my only child!"</p>

<p>Fleur laid her forehead against his shoulder.</p>

<p>All was in such turmoil within her. But no good to show it! No
good at all! She broke away from him, and went out into the
twilight, distraught, but unconvinced. All was indeterminate and
vague within her, like the shapes and shadows in the garden,
except&mdash;her will to have. A poplar pierced up into the
dark-blue sky and touched a white star there. The dew wetted her
shoes, and chilled her bare shoulders. She went down to the river
bank, and stood gazing at a moonstreak on the darkening water.
Suddenly she smelled tobacco smoke, and a white figure emerged as
if created by the moon. It was young Mont in flannels, standing in
his boat. She heard the tiny hiss of his cigarette extinguished in
the water.</p>

<p>"Fleur," came his voice, "don't be hard on a poor devil! I've
been waiting hours."</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"Come in my boat!"</p>

<p>"Not I."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I'm not a water-nymph."</p>

<p>"Haven't you any romance in you? Don't be modern, Fleur!"</p>

<p>He appeared on the path within a yard of her.</p>

<p>"Go away!"</p>

<p>"Fleur, I love you. Fleur!"</p>

<p>Fleur uttered a short laugh.</p>

<p>"Come again," she said, "when I haven't got my wish."</p>

<p>"What is your wish?"</p>

<p>"Ask another."</p>

<p>"Fleur," said Mont, and his voice sounded strange, "don't mock
me! Even vivisected dogs are worth decent treatment before they're
cut up for good."</p>

<p>Fleur shook her head; but her lips were trembling.</p>

<p>"Well, you shouldn't make me jump. Give me a cigarette."</p>

<p>Mont gave her one, lighted it, and another for himself.</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk rot," he said, "but please imagine all the
rot that all the lovers that ever were have talked, and all my
special rot thrown in."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I have imagined it. Good-night!" They stood for a
moment facing each other in the shadow of an acacia-tree with very
moonlit blossoms, and the smoke from their cigarettes mingled in
the air between them.</p>

<p>"Also ran: 'Michael Mont'?" he said. Fleur turned abruptly
toward the house. On the lawn she stopped to look back. Michael
Mont was whirling his arms above him; she could see them dashing at
his head; then waving at the moonlit blossoms of the acacia. His
voice just reached her. "Jolly-jolly!" Fleur shook herself. She
couldn't help him, she had too much trouble of her own! On the
verandah she stopped very suddenly again. Her mother was sitting in
the drawing-room at her writing bureau, quite alone. There was
nothing remarkable in the expression of her face except its utter
immobility. But she looked desolate! Fleur went upstairs. At the
door of her room she paused. She could hear her father walking up
and down, up and down the picture-gallery.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she thought, jolly! Oh, Jon!'</p>

<hr>

<h3>X.&mdash;DECISION</h3>

<p>When Fleur left him Jon stared at the Austrian. She was a thin
woman with a dark face and the concerned expression of one who has
watched every little good that life once had slip from her, one by
one. "No tea?" she said.</p>

<p>Susceptible to the disappointment in her voice, Jon
murmured:</p>

<p>"No, really; thanks."</p>

<p>"A lil cup&mdash;it ready. A lil cup and cigarette."</p>

<p>Fleur was gone! Hours of remorse and indecision lay before him!
And with a heavy sense of disproportion he smiled, and said:</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;thank you!"</p>

<p>She brought in a little pot of tea with two little cups, and a
silver box of cigarettes on a little tray.</p>

<p>"Sugar? Miss Forsyte has much sugar&mdash;she buy my sugar, my
friend's sugar also. Miss Forsyte is a veree kind lady. I am happy
to serve her. You her brother?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jon, beginning to puff the second cigarette of his
life.</p>

<p>"Very young brother," said the Austrian, with a little anxious
smile, which reminded him of the wag of a dog's tail.</p>

<p>"May I give you some?" he said. "And won't you sit down,
please?"</p>

<p>The Austrian shook her head.</p>

<p>"Your father a very nice old man&mdash;the most nice old man I
ever see. Miss Forsyte tell me all about him. Is he better?"</p>

<p>Her words fell on Jon like a reproach. "Oh Yes, I think he's all
right."</p>

<p>"I like to see him again," said the Austrian, putting a hand on
her heart; "he have veree kind heart."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jon. And again her words seemed to him a
reproach.</p>

<p>"He never give no trouble to no one, and smile so gentle."</p>

<p>"Yes, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"He look at Miss Forsyte so funny sometimes. I tell him all my
story; he so sympatisch. Your mother&mdash;she nice and well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very."</p>

<p>"He have her photograph on his dressing-table. Veree
beautiful"</p>

<p>Jon gulped down his tea. This woman, with her concerned face and
her reminding words, was like the first and second murderers.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said; "I must go now. May&mdash;may I leave this
with you?"</p>

<p>He put a ten-shilling note on the tray with a doubting hand and
gained the door. He heard the Austrian gasp, and hurried out. He
had just time to catch his train, and all the way to Victoria
looked at every face that passed, as lovers will, hoping against
hope. On reaching Worthing he put his luggage into the local train,
and set out across the Downs for Wansdon, trying to walk off his
aching irresolution. So long as he went full bat, he could enjoy
the beauty of those green slopes, stopping now and again to sprawl
on the grass, admire the perfection of a wild rose or listen to a
lark's song. But the war of motives within him was but
postponed&mdash;the longing for Fleur, and the hatred of deception.
He came to the old chalk-pit above Wansdon with his mind no more
made up than when he started. To see both sides of a question
vigorously was at once Jon's strength and weakness. He tramped in,
just as the first dinner-bell rang. His things had already been
brought up. He had a hurried bath and came down to find Holly
alone&mdash;Val had gone to Town and would not be back till the
last train.</p>

<p>Since Val's advice to him to ask his sister what was the matter
between the two families, so much had happened&mdash;Fleur's
disclosure in the Green Park, her visit to Robin Hill, to-day's
meeting&mdash;that there seemed nothing to ask. He talked of Spain,
his sunstroke, Val's horses, their father's health. Holly startled
him by saying that she thought their father not at all well. She
had been twice to Robin Hill for the week-end. He had seemed
fearfully languid, sometimes even in pain, but had always refused
to talk about himself.</p>

<p>"He's awfully dear and unselfish&mdash;don't you think,
Jon?"</p>

<p>Feeling far from dear and unselfish himself, Jon answered:
"Rather!"</p>

<p>"I think, he's been a simply perfect father, so long as I can
remember."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Jon, very subdued.</p>

<p>"He's never interfered, and he's always seemed to understand. I
shall never forget his letting me go to South Africa in the Boer
War when I was in love with Val."</p>

<p>"That was before he married Mother, wasn't it?" said Jon
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing. Only, wasn't she engaged to Fleur's father
first?"</p>

<p>Holly put down the spoon she was using, and raised her eyes. Her
stare was circumspect. What did the boy know? Enough to make it
better to tell him? She could not decide. He looked strained and
worried, altogether older, but that might be the sunstroke.</p>

<p>"There was something," she said. "Of course we were out there,
and got no news of anything." She could not take the risk.</p>

<p>It was not her secret. Besides, she was in the dark about his
feelings now. Before Spain she had made sure he was in love; but
boys were boys; that was seven weeks ago, and all Spain
between.</p>

<p>She saw that he knew she was putting him off, and added:</p>

<p>"Have you heard anything of Fleur?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>His face told her, then, more than the most elaborate
explanations. So he had not forgotten!</p>

<p>She said very quietly: "Fleur is awfully attractive, Jon, but
you know&mdash;Val and I don't really like her very much."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"We think she's got rather a 'having' nature."</p>

<p>"'Having'? I don't know what you mean. She&mdash;she&mdash;" he
pushed his dessert plate away, got up, and went to the window.</p>

<p>Holly, too, got up, and put her arm round his waist.</p>

<p>"Don't be angry, Jon dear. We can't all see people in the same
light, can we? You know, I believe each of us only has about one or
two people who can see the best that's in us, and bring it out. For
you I think it's your mother. I once saw her looking at a letter of
yours; it was wonderful to see her face. I think she's the most
beautiful woman I ever saw&mdash;Age doesn't seem to touch
her."</p>

<p>Jon's face softened; then again became tense.
Everybody&mdash;everybody was against him and Fleur! It all
strengthened the appeal of her words: "Make sure of me&mdash;marry
me, Jon!"</p>

<p>Here, where he had passed that wonderful week with her&mdash;the
tug of her enchantment, the ache in his heart increased with every
minute that she was not there to make the room, the garden, the
very air magical. Would he ever be able to live down here, not
seeing her? And he closed up utterly, going early to bed. It would
not make him healthy, wealthy, and wise, but it closeted him with
memory of Fleur in her fancy frock. He heard Val's
arrival&mdash;the Ford discharging cargo, then the stillness of the
summer night stole back&mdash;with only the bleating of very
distant sheep, and a night-Jar's harsh purring. He leaned far out.
Cold moon&mdash;warm air&mdash;the Downs like silver! Small wings,
a stream bubbling, the rambler roses! God&mdash;how empty all of it
without her! In the Bible it was written: Thou shalt leave father
and mother and cleave to&mdash;Fleur!</p>

<p>Let him have pluck, and go and tell them! They couldn't stop him
marrying her&mdash;they wouldn't want to stop him when they knew
how he felt. Yes! He would go! Bold and open&mdash;Fleur was
wrong!</p>

<p>The night-jar ceased, the sheep were silent; the only sound in
the darkness was the bubbling of the stream. And Jon in his bed
slept, freed from the worst of life's evils&mdash;indecision.</p>

<hr>

<h3>XI.&mdash;TIMOTHY PROPHESIES</h3>

<p>On the day of the cancelled meeting at the National Gallery
began the second anniversary of the resurrection of England's pride
and glory&mdash;or, more shortly, the top hat. "Lord's"&mdash;that
festival which the War had driven from the field&mdash;raised its
light and dark blue flags for the second time, displaying almost
every feature of a glorious past. Here, in the luncheon interval,
were all species of female and one species of male hat, protecting
the multiple types of face associated with "the classes." The
observing Forsyte might discern in the free or unconsidered seats a
certain number of the squash-hatted, but they hardly ventured on
the grass; the old school&mdash;or schools&mdash;could still
rejoice that the proletariat was not yet paying the necessary
half-crown. Here was still a close borough, the only one left on a
large scale&mdash;for the papers were about to estimate the
attendance at ten thousand. And the ten thousand, all animated by
one hope, were asking each other one question: "Where are you
lunching?" Something wonderfully uplifting and reassuring in that
query and the sight of so many people like themselves voicing it!
What reserve power in the British realm&mdash;enough pigeons,
lobsters, lamb, salmon mayonnaise, strawberries, and bottles of
champagne to feed the lot! No miracle in prospect&mdash;no case of
seven loaves and a few fishes&mdash;faith rested on surer
foundations. Six thousand top hats, four thousand parasols would be
doffed and furled, ten thousand mouths all speaking the same
English would be filled. There was life in the old dog yet!
Tradition! And again Tradition! How strong and how elastic! Wars
might rage, taxation prey, Trades Unions take toll, and Europe
perish of starvation; but the ten thousand would be fed; and,
within their ring fence, stroll upon green turf, wear their top
hats, and meet&mdash;themselves. The heart was sound, the pulse
still regular. E-ton! E-ton! Har-r-o-o-o-w!</p>

<p>Among the many Forsytes, present on a hunting-ground theirs, by
personal prescriptive right, or proxy, was Soames with his wife and
daughter. He had not been at either school, he took no interest in
cricket, but he wanted Fleur to show her frock, and he wanted to
wear his top hat parade it again in peace and plenty among his
peers. He walked sedately with Fleur between him and Annette. No
women equalled them, so far as he could see. They could walk, and
hold themselves up; there was substance in their good looks; the
modern woman had no build, no chest, no anything! He remembered
suddenly with what intoxication of pride he had walked round with
Irene in the first years of his first marriage. And how they used
to lunch on the drag which his mother would make his father have,
because it was so "chic"&mdash;all drags and carriages in those
days, not these lumbering great Stands! And how consistently
Montague Dartie had drunk too much. He supposed that people drank
too much still, but there was not the scope for it there used to
be. He remembered George Forsyte&mdash;whose brothers Roger and
Eustace had been at Harrow and Eton&mdash;towering up on the top of
the drag waving a light-blue flag with one hand and a dark-blue
flag with the other, and shouting "Etroow-Harrton!" Just when
everybody was silent, like the buffoon he had always been; and
Eustace got up to the nines below, too dandified to wear any colour
or take any notice. H'm! Old days, and Irene in grey silk shot with
palest green. He looked, sideways, at Fleur's face. Rather
colourless-no light, no eagerness! That love affair was preying on
her&mdash;a bad business! He looked beyond, at his wife's face,
rather more touched up than usual, a little disdainful&mdash;not
that she had any business to disdain, so far as he could see. She
was taking Profond's defection with curious quietude; or was his
"small" voyage just a blind? If so, he should refuse to see it!
Having promenaded round the pitch and in front of the pavilion,
they sought Winifred's table in the Bedouin Club tent. This
Club&mdash;a new "cock and hen"&mdash;had been founded in the
interests of travel, and of a gentleman with an old Scottish name,
whose father had somewhat strangely been called Levi. Winifred had
joined, not because she had travelled, but because instinct told
her that a Club with such a name and such a founder was bound to go
far; if one didn't join at once one might never have the chance.
Its tent, with a text from the Koran on an orange ground, and a
small green camel embroidered over the entrance, was the most
striking on the ground. Outside it they found Jack Cardigan in a
dark blue tie (he had once played for Harrow), batting with a
Malacca cane to show how that fellow ought to have hit that ball.
He piloted them in. Assembled in Winifred's corner were Imogen,
Benedict with his young wife, Val Dartie without Holly, Maud and
her husband, and, after Soames and his two were seated, one empty
place.</p>

<p>"I'm expecting Prosper," said Winifred, "but he's so busy with
his yacht."</p>

<p>Soames stole a glance. No movement in his wife's face! Whether
that fellow were coming or not, she evidently knew all about it. It
did not escape him that Fleur, too, looked at her mother. If
Annette didn't respect his feelings, she might think of Fleur's!
The conversation, very desultory, was syncopated by Jack Cardigan
talking about "mid-off." He cited all the "great mid-offs" from the
beginning of time, as if they had been a definite racial entity in
the composition of the British people. Soames had finished his
lobster, and was beginning on pigeon-pie, when he heard the words,
"I'm a small bit late, Mrs. Dartie," and saw that there was no
longer any empty place. That fellow was sitting between Annette and
Imogen. Soames ate steadily on, with an occasional word to Maud and
Winifred. Conversation buzzed around him. He heard the voice of
Profond say:</p>

<p>"I think you're mistaken, Mrs. Forsyde; I'll&mdash;I'll bet Miss
Forsyde agrees with me."</p>

<p>"In what?" came Fleur's clear voice across the table.</p>

<p>"I was sayin', young gurls are much the same as they always
were&mdash;there's very small difference."</p>

<p>"Do you know so much about them?"</p>

<p>That sharp reply caught the ears of all, and Soames moved
uneasily on his thin green chair.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know, I think they want their own small way, and
I think they always did."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but&mdash;Prosper," Winifred interjected comfortably, "the
girls in the streets&mdash;the girls who've been in munitions, the
little flappers in the shops; their manners now really quite hit
you in the eye."</p>

<p>At the word "hit" Jack Cardigan stopped his disquisition; and in
the silence Monsieur Profond said:</p>

<p>"It was inside before, now it's outside; that's all."</p>

<p>"But their morals!" cried Imogen.</p>

<p>"Just as moral as they ever were, Mrs. Cardigan, but they've got
more opportunity."</p>

<p>The saying, so cryptically cynical, received a little laugh from
Imogen, a slight opening of Jack Cardigan's mouth, and a creak from
Soames' chair.</p>

<p>Winifred said: "That's too bad, Prosper."</p>

<p>"What do you say, Mrs. Forsyde; don't you think human nature's
always the same?"</p>

<p>Soames subdued a sudden longing to get up and kick the fellow.
He heard his wife reply:</p>

<p>"Human nature is not the same in England as anywhere else." That
was her confounded mockery!</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know much about this small country"&mdash;'No,
thank God!' thought Soames&mdash;"but I should say the pot was
boilin' under the lid everywhere. We all want pleasure, and we
always did."</p>

<p>Damn the fellow! His cynicism was&mdash;was outrageous!</p>

<p>When lunch was over they broke up into couples for the digestive
promenade. Too proud to notice, Soames knew perfectly that Annette
and that fellow had gone prowling round together. Fleur was with
Val; she had chosen him, no doubt, because he knew that boy. He
himself had Winifred for partner. They walked in the bright,
circling stream, a little flushed and sated, for some minutes, till
Winifred sighed:</p>

<p>"I wish we were back forty years, old boy!"</p>

<p>Before the eyes of her spirit an interminable procession of her
own "Lord's" frocks was passing, paid for with the money of her
father, to save a recurrent crisis. "It's been very amusing, after
all. Sometimes I even wish Monty was back. What do you think of
people nowadays, Soames?"</p>

<p>"Precious little style. The thing began to go to pieces with
bicycles and motor-cars; the War has finished it."</p>

<p>"I wonder what's coming?" said Winifred in a voice dreamy from
pigeon-pie. "I'm not at all sure we shan't go back to crinolines
and pegtops. Look at that dress!"</p>

<p>Soames shook his head.</p>

<p>"There's money, but no faith in things. We don't lay by for the
future. These youngsters&mdash;it's all a short life and a merry
one with them."</p>

<p>"There's a hat!" said Winifred. "I don't know&mdash;when you
come to think of the people killed and all that in the War, it's
rather wonderful, I think. There's no other country&mdash;Prosper
says the rest are all bankrupt, except America; and of course her
men always took their style in dress from us."</p>

<p>"Is that chap," said Soames, "really going to the South
Seas?"</p>

<p>"Oh! one never knows where Prosper's going!"</p>

<p>"He's a sign of the times," muttered Soames, "if you like."</p>

<p>Winifred's hand gripped his arm.</p>

<p>"Don't turn your head," she said in a low voice, "but look to
your right in the front row of the Stand."</p>

<p>Soames looked as best he could under that limitation. A man in a
grey top hat, grey-bearded, with thin brown, folded cheeks, and a
certain elegance of posture, sat there with a woman in a
lawn-coloured frock, whose dark eyes were fixed on himself. Soames
looked quickly at his feet. How funnily feet moved, one after the
other like that! Winifred's voice said in his ear:</p>

<p>"Jolyon looks very ill; but he always had style. She doesn't
change&mdash;except her hair."</p>

<p>"Why did you tell Fleur about that business?"</p>

<p>"I didn't; she picked it up. I always knew she would."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a mess. She's set her heart upon their boy."</p>

<p>"The little wretch," murmured Winifred. "She tried to take me in
about that. What shall you do, Soames?"</p>

<p>"Be guided by events."</p>

<p>They moved on, silent, in the almost solid crowd.</p>

<p>"Really," said Winifred suddenly; "it almost seems like Fate.
Only that's so old-fashioned. Look! there are George and
Eustace!"</p>

<p>George Forsyte's lofty bulk had halted before them.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Soames!" he said. "Just met Profond and your wife.
You'll catch 'em if you put on pace. Did you ever go to see old
Timothy?"</p>

<p>Soames nodded, and the streams forced them apart.</p>

<p>"I always liked old George," said Winifred. "He's so droll."</p>

<p>"I never did," said Soames. "Where's your seat? I shall go to
mine. Fleur may be back there."</p>

<p>Having seen Winifred to her seat, he regained his own, conscious
of small, white, distant figures running, the click of the bat, the
cheers and counter-cheers. No Fleur, and no Annette! You could
expect nothing of women nowadays! They had the vote. They were
"emancipated," and much good it was doing them! So Winifred would
go back, would she, and put up with Dartie all over again? To have
the past once more&mdash;to be sitting here as he had sat in '83
and '84, before he was certain that his marriage with Irene had
gone all wrong, before her antagonism had become so glaring that
with the best will in the world he could not overlook it. The sight
of her with that fellow had brought all memory back. Even now he
could not understand why she had been so impracticable. She could
love other men; she had it in her! To himself, the one person she
ought to have loved, she had chosen to refuse her heart. It seemed
to him, fantastically, as he looked back, that all this modern
relaxation of marriage&mdash;though its forms and laws were the
same as when he married her&mdash;that all this modern looseness
had come out of her revolt; it seemed to him, fantastically, that
she had started it, till all decent ownership of anything had gone,
or was on the point of going. All came from her! And now&mdash;a
pretty state of things! Homes! How could you have them without
mutual ownership? Not that he had ever had a real home! But had
that been his fault? He had done his best. And his rewards
were&mdash;those two sitting in that Stand, and this affair of
Fleur's!</p>

<p>And overcome by loneliness he thought: 'Shan't wait any longer!
They must find their own way back to the hotel&mdash;if they mean
to come!' Hailing a cab outside the ground, he said:</p>

<p>"Drive me to the Bayswater Road." His old aunts had never failed
him. To them he had meant an ever-welcome visitor. Though they were
gone, there, still, was Timothy!</p>

<p>Smither was standing in the open doorway.</p>

<p>"Mr. Soames! I was just taking the air. Cook will be so
pleased."</p>

<p>"How is Mr. Timothy?"</p>

<p>"Not himself at all these last few days, sir; he's been talking
a great deal. Only this morning he was saying: 'My brother James,
he's getting old.' His mind wanders, Mr. Soames, and then he will
talk of them. He troubles about their investments. The other day he
said: 'There's my brother Jolyon won't look at Consols'&mdash;he
seemed quite down about it. Come in, Mr. Soames, come in! It's such
a pleasant change!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Soames, "just for a few minutes."</p>

<p>"No," murmured Smither in the hall, where the air had the
singular freshness of the outside day, "we haven't been very
satisfied with him, not all this week. He's always been one to
leave a titbit to the end; but ever since Monday he's been eating
it first. If you notice a dog, Mr. Soames, at its dinner, it eats
the meat first. We've always thought it such a good sign of Mr.
Timothy at his age to leave it to the last, but now he seems to
have lost all his self-control; and, of course, it makes him leave
the rest. The doctor doesn't make anything of it,
but"&mdash;Smither shook her head&mdash;"he seems to think he's got
to eat it first, in case he shouldn't get to it. That and his
talking makes us anxious."</p>

<p>"Has he said anything important?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like to say that, Mr. Soames; but he's turned
against his Will. He gets quite pettish&mdash;and after having had
it out every morning for years, it does seem funny. He said the
other day: 'They want my money.' It gave me such a turn, because,
as I said to him, nobody wants his money, I'm sure. And it does
seem a pity he should be thinking about money at his time of life.
I took my courage in my 'ands. 'You know, Mr. Timothy,' I said, 'my
dear mistress'&mdash;that's Miss Forsyte, Mr. Soames, Miss Ann that
trained me&mdash;'she never thought about money,' I said, 'it was
all character with her.' He looked at me, I can't tell you how
funny, and he said quite dry: 'Nobody wants my character.' Think of
his saying a thing like that! But sometimes he'll say something as
sharp and sensible as anything."</p>

<p>Soames, who had been staring at an old print by the hat-rack,
thinking, 'That's got value!' murmured: "I'll go up and see him,
Smither."</p>

<p>"Cook's with him," answered Smither above her corsets; "she will
be pleased to see you."</p>

<p>He mounted slowly, with the thought: 'Shan't care to live to be
that age.'</p>

<p>On the second floor, he paused, and tapped. The door was opened,
and he saw the round homely face of a woman about sixty.</p>

<p>"Mr. Soames!" she said: "Why! Mr. Soames!"</p>

<p>Soames nodded. "All right, Cook!" and entered.</p>

<p>Timothy was propped up in bed, with his hands joined before his
chest, and his eyes fixed on the ceiling, where a fly was standing
upside down. Soames stood at the foot of the bed, facing him.</p>

<p>"Uncle Timothy," he said, raising his voice. "Uncle
Timothy!"</p>

<p>Timothy's eyes left the fly, and levelled themselves on his
visitor. Soames could see his pale tongue passing over his darkish
lips.</p>

<p>"Uncle Timothy," he said again, "is there anything I can do for
you? Is there anything you'd like to say?"</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Timothy.</p>

<p>"I've come to look you up and see that everything's all
right."</p>

<p>Timothy nodded. He seemed trying to get used to the apparition
before him.</p>

<p>"Have you got everything you want?"</p>

<p>"No," said Timothy.</p>

<p>"Can I get you anything?"</p>

<p>"No," said Timothy.</p>

<p>"I'm Soames, you know; your nephew, Soames Forsyte. Your brother
James' son."</p>

<p>Timothy nodded.</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted to do anything I can for you."</p>

<p>Timothy beckoned. Soames went close to him:</p>

<p>"You&mdash;" said Timothy in a voice which seemed to have
outlived tone, "you tell them all from me&mdash;you tell them
all&mdash;" and his finger tapped on Soames' arm, "to hold
on&mdash;hold on&mdash;Consols are goin' up," and he nodded
thrice.</p>

<p>"All right!" said Soames; "I will."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Timothy, and, fixing his eyes again on the ceiling,
he added: "That fly!"</p>

<p>Strangely moved, Soames looked at the Cook's pleasant fattish
face, all little puckers from staring at fires.</p>

<p>"That'll do him a world of good, sir," she said.</p>

<p>A mutter came from Timothy, but he was clearly speaking to
himself, and Soames went out with the cook.</p>

<p>"I wish I could make you a pink cream, Mr. Soames, like in old
days; you did so relish them. Good-bye, sir; it has been a
pleasure."</p>

<p>"Take care of him, Cook, he is old."</p>

<p>And, shaking her crumpled hand, he went down-stairs. Smither was
still taking the air in the doorway.</p>

<p>"What do you think of him, Mr. Soames?"</p>

<p>"H'm!" Soames murmured: "He's lost touch."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Smither, "I was afraid you'd think that coming fresh
out of the world to see him like."</p>

<p>"Smither," said Soames, "we're all indebted to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mr. Soames, don't say that! It's a pleasure&mdash;he's
such a wonderful man."</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye!" said Soames, and got into his taxi.</p>

<p>'Going up!' he thought; 'going up!'</p>

<p>Reaching the hotel at Knightsbridge he went to their
sitting-room, and rang for tea. Neither of them were in. And again
that sense of loneliness came over him. These hotels. What
monstrous great places they were now! He could remember when there
was nothing bigger than Long's or Brown's, Morley's or the
Tavistock, and the heads that were shaken over the Langham and the
Grand. Hotels and Clubs&mdash;Clubs and Hotels; no end to them now!
And Soames, who had just been watching at Lord's a miracle of
tradition and continuity, fell into reverie over the changes in
that London where he had been born five-and-sixty years before.
Whether Consols were going up or not, London had become a terrific
property. No such property in the world, unless it were New York!
There was a lot of hysteria in the papers nowadays; but any one
who, like himself, could remember London sixty years ago, and see
it now, realised the fecundity and elasticity of wealth. They had
only to keep their heads, and go at it steadily. Why! he remembered
cobblestones, and stinking straw on the floor of your cab. And old
Timothy&mdash;what could he not have told them, if he had kept his
memory! Things were unsettled, people in a funk or in a hurry, but
here were London and the Thames, and out there the British Empire,
and the ends of the earth. "Consols are goin' up!" He shouldn't be
a bit surprised. It was the breed that counted. And all that was
bull-dogged in Soames stared for a moment out of his grey eyes,
till diverted by the print of a Victorian picture on the walls. The
hotel had bought three dozen of that little lot! The old hunting or
"Rake's Progress" prints in the old inns were worth looking
at&mdash;but this sentimental stuff&mdash;well, Victorianism had
gone! "Tell them to hold on!" old Timothy had said. But to what
were they to hold on in this modern welter of the "democratic
principle"? Why, even privacy was threatened! And at the thought
that privacy might perish, Soames pushed back his teacup and went
to the window. Fancy owning no more of Nature than the crowd out
there owned of the flowers and trees and waters of Hyde Park! No,
no! Private possession underlay everything worth having. The world
had slipped its sanity a bit, as dogs now and again at full moon
slipped theirs and went off for a night's rabbiting; but the world,
like the dog, knew where its bread was buttered and its bed warm,
and would come back sure enough to the only home worth
having&mdash;to private ownership. The world was in its second
childhood for the moment, like old Timothy&mdash;eating its titbit
first!</p>

<p>He heard a sound behind him, and saw that his wife and daughter
had come in.</p>

<p>"So you're back!" he said.</p>

<p>Fleur did not answer; she stood for a moment looking at him and
her mother, then passed into her bedroom. Annette poured herself
out a cup of tea.</p>

<p>"I am going to Paris, to my mother, Soames."</p>

<p>"Oh! To your mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"For how long?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"And when are you going?"</p>

<p>"On Monday."</p>

<p>Was she really going to her mother? Odd, how indifferent he
felt! Odd, how clearly she had perceived the indifference he would
feel so long as there was no scandal. And suddenly between her and
himself he saw distinctly the face he had seen that
afternoon&mdash;Irene's.</p>

<p>"Will you want money?"</p>

<p>"Thank you; I have enough."</p>

<p>"Very well. Let us know when you are coming back."</p>

<p>Annette put down the cake she was fingering, and, looking up
through darkened lashes, said:</p>

<p>"Shall I give Maman any message?"</p>

<p>"My regards."</p>

<p>Annette stretched herself, her hands on her waist, and said in
French:</p>

<p>"What luck that you have never loved me, Soames!" Then rising,
she too left the room. Soames was glad she had spoken it in
French&mdash;it seemed to require no dealing with. Again that other
face&mdash;pale, dark-eyed, beautiful still! And there stirred far
down within him the ghost of warmth, as from sparks lingering
beneath a mound of flaky ash. And Fleur infatuated with her boy!
Queer chance! Yet, was there such a thing as chance? A man went
down a street, a brick fell on his head. Ah! that was chance, no
doubt. But this! "Inherited," his girl had said. She&mdash;she was
"holding on"!</p>

<hr>

<h3>PART III</h3>

<hr>

<h3>I.&mdash;OLD JOLYON WALKS</h3>

<p>Twofold impulse had made Jolyon say to his wife at breakfast
"Let's go up to Lord's!"</p>

<p>"Wanted"&mdash;something to abate the anxiety in which those two
had lived during the sixty hours since Jon had brought Fleur down.
"Wanted"&mdash;too, that which might assuage the pangs of memory in
one who knew he might lose them any day!</p>

<p>Fifty-eight years ago Jolyon had become an Eton boy, for old
Jolyon's whim had been that he should be canonised at the greatest
possible expense. Year after year he had gone to Lord's from
Stanhope Gate with a father whose youth in the eighteen-twenties
had been passed without polish in the game of cricket. Old Jolyon
would speak quite openly of swipes, full tosses, half and
three-quarter balls; and young Jolyon with the guileless snobbery
of youth had trembled lest his sire should be overheard. Only in
this supreme matter of cricket he had been nervous, for his
father&mdash;in Crimean whiskers then&mdash;had ever impressed him
as the beau ideal. Though never canonised himself, Old Jolyon's
natural fastidiousness and balance had saved him from the errors of
the vulgar. How delicious, after howling in a top hat and a
sweltering heat, to go home with his father in a hansom cab, bathe,
dress, and forth to the "Disunion" Club, to dine off white bait,
cutlets, and a tart, and go&mdash;two "swells," old and young, in
lavender kid gloves&mdash;to the opera or play. And on Sunday, when
the match was over, and his top hat duly broken, down with his
father in a special hansom to the "Crown and Sceptre," and the
terrace above the river&mdash;the golden sixties when the world was
simple, dandies glamorous, Democracy not born, and the books of
Whyte Melville coming thick and fast.</p>

<p>A generation later, with his own boy, Jolly, Harrow-buttonholed
with corn-flowers&mdash;by old Jolyon's whim his grandson had been
canonised at a trifle less expense&mdash;again Jolyon had
experienced the heat and counter-passions of the day, and come back
to the cool and the strawberry beds of Robin Hill, and billiards
after dinner, his boy making the most heart-breaking flukes and
trying to seem languid and grown-up. Those two days each year he
and his son had been alone together in the world, one on each
side&mdash;and Democracy just born!</p>

<p>And so, he had unearthed a grey top hat, borrowed a tiny bit of
light-blue ribbon from Irene, and gingerly, keeping cool, by car
and train and taxi, had reached Lord's Ground. There, beside her in
a lawn-coloured frock with narrow black edges, he had watched the
game, and felt the old thrill stir within him.</p>

<p>When Soames passed, the day was spoiled. Irene's face was
distorted by compression of the lips. No good to go on sitting here
with Soames or perhaps his daughter recurring in front of them,
like decimals. And he said:</p>

<p>"Well, dear, if you've had enough&mdash;let's go!"</p>

<p>That evening Jolyon felt exhausted. Not wanting her to see him
thus, he waited till she had begun to play, and stole off to the
little study. He opened the long window for air, and the door, that
he might still hear her music drifting in; and, settled in his
father's old armchair, closed his eyes, with his head against the
worn brown leather. Like that passage of the Cesar Franck
Sonata&mdash;so had been his life with her, a divine third
movement. And now this business of Jon's&mdash;this bad business!
Drifted to the edge of consciousness, he hardly knew if it were in
sleep that he smelled the scent of a cigar, and seemed to see his
father in the blackness before his closed eyes. That shape formed,
went, and formed again; as if in the very chair where he himself
was sitting, he saw his father, black-coated, with knees crossed,
glasses balanced between thumb and finger; saw the big white
moustaches, and the deep eyes looking up below a dome of forehead
and seeming to search his own, seeming to speak. "Are you facing
it, Jo? It's for you to decide. She's only a woman!" Ah! how well
he knew his father in that phrase; how all the Victorian Age came
up with it! And his answer "No, I've funked it&mdash;funked hurting
her and Jon and myself. I've got a heart; I've funked it." But the
old eyes, so much older, so much younger than his own, kept at it;
"It's your wife, your son; your past. Tackle it, my boy!" Was it a
message from walking spirit; or but the instinct of his sire living
on within him? And again came that scent of cigar smoke-from the
old saturated leather. Well! he would tackle it, write to Jon, and
put the whole thing down in black and white! And suddenly he
breathed with difficulty, with a sense of suffocation, as if his
heart were swollen. He got up and went out into the air. The stars
were very bright. He passed along the terrace round the corner of
the house, till, through the window of the music-room, he could see
Irene at the piano, with lamp-light falling on her powdery hair;
withdrawn into herself she seemed, her dark eyes staring straight
before her, her hands idle. Jolyon saw her raise those hands and
clasp them over her breast. 'It's Jon, with her,' he thought; 'all
Jon! I'm dying out of her&mdash;it's natural!'</p>

<p>And, careful not to be seen, he stole back.</p>

<p>Next day, after a bad night, he sat down to his task. He wrote
with difficulty and many erasures.</p>

<blockquote>"MY DEAREST BOY,<br>
<br>
"You are old enough to understand how very difficult it is for
elders to give themselves away to their young. Especially
when&mdash;like your mother and myself, though I shall never think
of her as anything but young&mdash;their hearts are altogether set
on him to whom they must confess. I cannot say we are conscious of
having sinned exactly&mdash;people in real life very seldom are, I
believe&mdash;but most persons would say we had, and at all events
our conduct, righteous or not, has found us out. The truth is, my
dear, we both have pasts, which it is now my task to make known to
you, because they so grievously and deeply affect your future.
Many, very many years ago, as far back indeed as 1883, when she was
only twenty, your mother had the great and lasting misfortune to
make an unhappy marriage&mdash;no, not with me, Jon. Without money
of her own, and with only a stepmother&mdash;closely related to
Jezebel&mdash;she was very unhappy in her home life. It was Fleur's
father that she married, my cousin Soames Forsyte. He had pursued
her very tenaciously and to do him justice was deeply in love with
her. Within a week she knew the fearful mistake she had made. It
was not his fault; it was her error of judgment&mdash;her
misfortune."</blockquote>

<p>So far Jolyon had kept some semblance of irony, but now his
subject carried him away.</p>

<blockquote>"Jon, I want to explain to you if I can&mdash;and it's
very hard&mdash;how it is that an unhappy marriage such as this can
so easily come about. You will of course say: 'If she didn't really
love him how could she ever have married him?' You would be right
if it were not for one or two rather terrible considerations. From
this initial mistake of hers all the subsequent trouble, sorrow,
and tragedy have come, and so I must make it clear to you if I can.
You see, Jon, in those days and even to this day&mdash;indeed, I
don't see, for all the talk of enlightenment, how it can well be
otherwise&mdash;most girls are married ignorant of the sexual side
of life. Even if they know what it means they have not experienced
it. That's the crux. It is this actual lack of experience, whatever
verbal knowledge they have, which makes all the difference and all
the trouble. In a vast number of marriages-and your mother's was
one&mdash;girls are not and cannot be certain whether they love the
man they marry or not; they do not know until after that act of
union which makes the reality of marriage. Now, in many, perhaps in
most doubtful cases, this act cements and strengthens the
attachment, but in other cases, and your mother's was one, it is a
revelation of mistake, a destruction of such attraction as there
was. There is nothing more tragic in a woman's life than such a
revelation, growing daily, nightly clearer. Coarse-grained and
unthinking people are apt to laugh at such a mistake, and say,
'What a fuss about nothing!' Narrow and self-righteous people, only
capable of judging the lives of others by their own, are apt to
condemn those who make this tragic error, to condemn them for life
to the dungeons they have made for themselves. You know the
expression: 'She has made her bed, she must lie on it!' It is a
hard-mouthed saying, quite unworthy of a gentleman or lady in the
best sense of those words; and I can use no stronger condemnation.
I have not been what is called a moral man, but I wish to use no
words to you, my dear, which will make you think lightly of ties or
contracts into which you enter. Heaven forbid! But with the
experience of a life behind me I do say that those who condemn the
victims of these tragic mistakes, condemn them and hold out no
hands to help them, are inhuman, or rather they would be if they
had the understanding to know what they are doing. But they
haven't! Let them go! They are as much anathema to me as I, no
doubt, am to them. I have had to say all this, because I am going
to put you into a position to judge your mother, and you are very
young, without experience of what life is. To go on with the story.
After three years of effort to subdue her shrinking&mdash;I was
going to say her loathing and it's not too strong a word, for
shrinking soon becomes loathing under such
circumstances&mdash;three years of what to a sensitive,
beauty-loving nature like your mother's, Jon, was torment, she met
a young man who fell in love with her. He was the architect of this
very house that we live in now, he was building it for her and
Fleur's father to live in, a new prison to hold her, in place of
the one she inhabited with him in London. Perhaps that fact played
some part in what came of it. But in any case she, too, fell in
love with him. I know it's not necessary to explain to you that one
does not precisely choose with whom one will fall in love. It
comes. Very well! It came. I can imagine&mdash;though she never
said much to me about it&mdash;the struggle that then took place in
her, because, Jon, she was brought up strictly and was not light in
her ideas&mdash;not at all. However, this was an overwhelming
feeling, and it came to pass that they loved in deed as well as in
thought. Then came a fearful tragedy. I must tell you of it because
if I don't you will never understand the real situation that you
have now to face. The man whom she had married&mdash;Soames
Forsyte, the father of Fleur one night, at the height of her
passion for this young man, forcibly reasserted his rights over
her. The next day she met her lover and told him of it. Whether he
committed suicide or whether he was accidentally run over in his
distraction, we never knew; but so it was. Think of your mother as
she was that evening when she heard of his death. I happened to see
her. Your grandfather sent me to help her if I could. I only just
saw her, before the door was shut against me by her husband. But I
have never forgotten her face, I can see it now. I was not in love
with her then, not for twelve years after, but I have never for
gotten. My dear boy&mdash;it is not easy to write like this. But
you see, I must. Your mother is wrapped up in you, utterly,
devotedly. I don't wish to write harshly of Soames Forsyte. I don't
think harshly of him. I have long been sorry for him; perhaps I was
sorry even then. As the world judges she was in error, he within
his rights. He loved her&mdash;in his way. She was his property.
That is the view he holds of life&mdash;of human feelings and
hearts&mdash;property. It's not his fault&mdash;so was he born. To
me it is a view that has always been abhorrent&mdash;so was I born!
Knowing you as I do, I feel it cannot be otherwise than abhorrent
to you. Let me go on with the story. Your mother fled from his
house that night; for twelve years she lived quietly alone without
companionship of any sort, until in 1899 her husband&mdash;you see,
he was still her husband, for he did not attempt to divorce her,
and she of course had no right to divorce him&mdash;became
conscious, it seems, of the want of children, and commenced a long
attempt to induce her to go back to him and give him a child. I was
her trustee then, under your Grandfather's Will, and I watched this
going on. While watching, I became attached to her, devotedly
attached. His pressure increased, till one day she came to me here
and practically put herself under my protection. Her husband, who
was kept informed of all her movements, attempted to force us apart
by bringing a divorce suit, or possibly he really meant it, I don't
know; but anyway our names were publicly joined. That decided us,
and we became united in fact. She was divorced, married me, and you
were born. We have lived in perfect happiness, at least I have, and
I believe your mother also. Soames, soon after the divorce, married
Fleur's mother, and she was born. That is the story, Jon. I have
told it you, because by the affection which we see you have formed
for this man's daughter you are blindly moving toward what must
utterly destroy your mother's happiness, if not your own. I don't
wish to speak of myself, because at my age there's no use supposing
I shall cumber the ground much longer, besides, what I should
suffer would be mainly on her account, and on yours. But what I
want you to realise is that feelings of horror and aversion such as
those can never be buried or forgotten. They are alive in her
to-day. Only yesterday at Lord's we happened to see Soames Forsyte.
Her face, if you had seen it, would have convinced you. The idea
that you should marry his daughter is a nightmare to her, Jon. I
have nothing to say against Fleur save that she is his daughter.
But your children, if you married her, would be the grandchildren
of Soames, as much as of your mother, of a man who once owned your
mother as a man might own a slave. Think what that would mean. By
such a marriage you enter the camp which held your mother prisoner
and wherein she ate her heart out. You are just on the threshold of
life, you have only known this girl two months, and however deeply
you think you love her, I appeal to you to break it off at once.
Don't give your mother this rankling pain and humiliation during
the rest of her life. Young though she will always seem to me, she
is fifty-seven. Except for us two she has no one in the world. She
will soon have only you. Pluck up your spirit, Jon, and break away.
Don't put this cloud and barrier between you. Don't break her
heart! Bless you, my dear boy, and again forgive me for all the
pain this letter must bring you&mdash;we tried to spare it you, but
Spain&mdash;it seems&mdash;was no good.<br>
<br>
"Ever your devoted father,<br>
<br>
"JOLYON FORSYTE."</blockquote>

<p>Having finished his confession, Jolyon sat with a thin cheek on
his hand, re-reading. There were things in it which hurt him so
much, when he thought of Jon reading them, that he nearly tore the
letter up. To speak of such things at all to a boy&mdash;his own
boy&mdash;to speak of them in relation to his own wife and the
boy's own mother, seemed dreadful to the reticence of his Forsyte
soul. And yet without speaking of them how make Jon understand the
reality, the deep cleavage, the ineffaceable scar? Without them,
how justify this stiffing of the boy's love? He might just as well
not write at all!</p>

<p>He folded the confession, and put it in his pocket. It
was&mdash;thank Heaven!&mdash;Saturday; he had till Sunday evening
to think it over; for even if posted now it could not reach Jon
till Monday. He felt a curious relief at this delay, and at the
fact that, whether sent or not, it was written.</p>

<p>In the rose garden, which had taken the place of the old
fernery, he could see Irene snipping and pruning, with a little
basket on her arm. She was never idle, it seemed to him, and he
envied her now that he himself was idle nearly all his time. He
went down to her. She held up a stained glove and smiled. A piece
of lace tied under her chin concealed her hair, and her oval face
with its still dark brows looked very young.</p>

<p>"The green-fly are awful this year, and yet it's cold. You look
tired, Jolyon."</p>

<p>Jolyon took the confession from his pocket. "I've been writing
this. I think you ought to see it?"</p>

<p>"To Jon?" Her whole face had changed, in that instant, becoming
almost haggard.</p>

<p>"Yes; the murder's out."</p>

<p>He gave it to her, and walked away among the roses. Presently,
seeing that she had finished reading and was standing quite still
with the sheets of the letter against her skirt, he came back to
her.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"It's wonderfully put. I don't see how it could be put better.
Thank you, dear."</p>

<p>"Is there anything you would like left out?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"No; he must know all, if he's to understand."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought, but&mdash;I hate it!"</p>

<p>He had the feeling that he hated it more than she&mdash;to him
sex was so much easier to mention between man and woman than
between man and man; and she had always been more natural and
frank, not deeply secretive like his Forsyte self.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he will understand, even now, Jolyon? He's so
young; and he shrinks from the physical."</p>

<p>"He gets that shrinking from my father, he was as fastidious as
a girl in all such matters. Would it be better to rewrite the whole
thing, and just say you hated Soames?"</p>

<p>Irene shook her head.</p>

<p>"Hate's only a word. It conveys nothing. No, better as it
is."</p>

<p>"Very well. It shall go to-morrow."</p>

<p>She raised her face to his, and in sight of the big house's many
creepered windows, he kissed her.</p>

<hr>

<h3>II.&mdash;CONFESSION</h3>

<p>Late that same afternoon, Jolyon had a nap in the old armchair.
Face down on his knee was La Rotisserie de la Refine Pedauque, and
just before he fell asleep he had been thinking: 'As a people shall
we ever really like the French? Will they ever really like us!' He
himself had always liked the French, feeling at home with their
wit, their taste, their cooking. Irene and he had paid many visits
to France before the War, when Jon had been at his private school.
His romance with her had begun in Paris&mdash;his last and most
enduring romance. But the French&mdash;no Englishman could like
them who could not see them in some sort with the detached
aesthetic eye! And with that melancholy conclusion he had nodded
off.</p>

<p>When he woke he saw Jon standing between him and the window. The
boy had evidently come in from the garden and was waiting for him
to wake. Jolyon smiled, still half asleep. How nice the chap
looked&mdash;sensitive, affectionate, straight! Then his heart gave
a nasty jump; and a quaking sensation overcame him. Jon! That
confession! He controlled himself with an effort. "Why, Jon, where
did you spring from?"</p>

<p>Jon bent over and kissed his forehead.</p>

<p>Only then he noticed the look on the boy's face.</p>

<p>"I came home to tell you something, Dad."</p>

<p>With all his might Jolyon tried to get the better of the
jumping, gurgling sensations within his chest.</p>

<p>"Well, sit down, old man. Have you seen your mother?"</p>

<p>"No." The boy's flushed look gave place to pallor; he sat down
on the arm of the old chair, as, in old days, Jolyon himself used
to sit beside his own father, installed in its recesses. Right up
to the time of the rupture in their relations he had been wont to
perch there&mdash;had he now reached such a moment with his own
son? All his life he had hated scenes like poison, avoided rows,
gone on his own way quietly and let others go on theirs. But
now&mdash;it seemed&mdash;at the very end of things, he had a scene
before him more painful than any he had avoided. He drew a visor
down over his emotion, and waited for his son to speak.</p>

<p>"Father," said Jon slowly, "Fleur and I are engaged."</p>

<p>'Exactly!' thought Jolyon, breathing with difficulty.</p>

<p>"I know that you and Mother don't like the idea. Fleur says that
Mother was engaged to her father before you married her. Of course
I don't know what happened, but it must be ages ago. I'm devoted to
her, Dad, and she says she is to me."</p>

<p>Jolyon uttered a queer sound, half laugh, half groan.</p>

<p>"You are nineteen, Jon, and I am seventy-two. How are we to
understand each other in a matter like this, eh?"</p>

<p>"You love Mother, Dad; you must know what we feel. It isn't fair
to us to let old things spoil our happiness, is it?"</p>

<p>Brought face to face with his confession, Jolyon resolved to do
without it if by any means he could. He laid his hand on the boy's
arm.</p>

<p>"Look, Jon! I might put you off with talk about your both being
too young and not knowing your own minds, and all that, but you
wouldn't listen, besides, it doesn't meet the case&mdash;Youth,
unfortunately, cures itself. You talk lightly about 'old things
like that,' knowing nothing&mdash;as you say truly&mdash;of what
happened. Now, have I ever given you reason to doubt my love for
you, or my word?"</p>

<p>At a less anxious moment he might have been amused by the
conflict his words aroused&mdash;the boy's eager clasp, to reassure
him on these points, the dread on his face of what that reassurance
would bring forth; but he could only feel grateful for the
squeeze.</p>

<p>"Very well, you can believe what I tell you. If you don't give
up this love affair, you will make Mother wretched to the end of
her days. Believe me, my dear, the past, whatever it was, can't be
buried&mdash;it can't indeed."</p>

<p>Jon got off the arm of the chair.</p>

<p>'The girl'&mdash;thought Jolyon&mdash;'there she
goes&mdash;starting up before him&mdash;life itself&mdash;eager,
pretty, loving!'</p>

<p>"I can't, Father; how can I&mdash;just because you say that? Of
course, I can't!"</p>

<p>"Jon, if you knew the story you would give this up without
hesitation; you would have to! Can't you believe me?"</p>

<p>"How can you tell what I should think? Father, I love her better
than anything in the world."</p>

<p>Jolyon's face twitched, and he said with painful slowness:</p>

<p>"Better than your mother, Jon?"</p>

<p>From the boy's face, and his clenched fists Jolyon realised the
stress and struggle he was going through.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he burst out, "I don't know! But to give Fleur
up for nothing&mdash;for something I don't understand, for
something that I don't believe can really matter half so much, will
make me&mdash;make me..."</p>

<p>"Make you feel us unjust, put a barrier&mdash;yes. But that's
better than going on with this."</p>

<p>"I can't. Fleur loves me, and I love her. You want me to trust
you; why don't you trust me, Father? We wouldn't want to know
anything&mdash;we wouldn't let it make any difference. It'll only
make us both love you and Mother all the more."</p>

<p>Jolyon put his hand into his breast pocket, but brought it out
again empty, and sat, clucking his tongue against his teeth.</p>

<p>"Think what your mother's been to you, Jon! She has nothing but
you; I shan't last much longer."</p>

<p>"Why not? It isn't fair to&mdash;Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jolyon, rather coldly, "because the doctors tell me
I shan't; that's all."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dad!" cried Jon, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>This downbreak of his son, whom he had not seen cry since he was
ten, moved Jolyon terribly. He recognised to the full how fearfully
soft the boy's heart was, how much he would suffer in this
business, and in life generally. And he reached out his hand
helplessly&mdash;not wishing, indeed not daring to get up.</p>

<p>"Dear man," he said, "don't&mdash;or you'll make me!"</p>

<p>Jon smothered down his paroxysm, and stood with face averted,
very still.</p>

<p>'What now?' thought Jolyon. 'What can I say to move him?'</p>

<p>"By the way, don't speak of that to Mother," he said; "she has
enough to frighten her with this affair of yours. I know how you
feel. But, Jon, you know her and me well enough to be sure we
wouldn't wish to spoil your happiness lightly. Why, my dear boy, we
don't care for anything but your happiness&mdash;at least, with me
it's just yours and Mother's and with her just yours. It's all the
future for you both that's at stake."</p>

<p>Jon turned. His face was deadly pale; his eyes, deep in his
head, seemed to burn.</p>

<p>"What is it? What is it? Don't keep me like this!"</p>

<p>Jolyon, who knew that he was beaten, thrust his hand again into
his breast pocket, and sat for a full minute, breathing with
difficulty, his eyes closed. The thought passed through his mind:
'I've had a good long innings&mdash;some pretty bitter
moments&mdash;this is the worst!' Then he brought his hand out with
the letter, and said with a sort of fatigue: "Well, Jon, if you
hadn't come to-day, I was going to send you this. I wanted to spare
you&mdash;I wanted to spare your mother and myself, but I see it's
no good. Read it, and I think I'll go into the garden." He reached
forward to get up.</p>

<p>Jon, who had taken the letter, said quickly, "No, I'll go"; and
was gone.</p>

<p>Jolyon sank back in his chair. A blue-bottle chose that moment
to come buzzing round him with a sort of fury; the sound was
homely, better than nothing...Where had the boy gone to read his
letter? The wretched letter&mdash;the wretched story! A cruel
business&mdash;cruel to her&mdash;to Soames&mdash;to those two
children&mdash;to himself!...His heart thumped and pained him.
Life&mdash;its loves&mdash;its work&mdash;its beauty&mdash;its
aching, and&mdash;its end! A good time; a fine time in spite of
all; until&mdash;you regretted that you had ever been born.
Life&mdash;it wore you down, yet did not make you want to
die&mdash;that was the cunning evil! Mistake to have a heart! Again
the blue-bottle came buzzing&mdash;bringing in all the heat and hum
and scent of summer&mdash;yes, even the scent&mdash;as of ripe
fruits, dried grasses, sappy shrubs, and the vanilla breath of
cows. And out there somewhere in the fragrance Jon would be reading
that letter, turning and twisting its pages in his trouble, his
bewilderment and trouble&mdash;breaking his heart about it! The
thought made Jolyon acutely miserable. Jon was such a
tender-hearted chap, affectionate to his bones, and conscientious,
too&mdash;it was so unfair, so damned unfair! He remembered Irene
saying to him once: "Never was any one born more loving and lovable
than Jon." Poor little Jon! His world gone up the spout, all of a
summer afternoon! Youth took things so hard! And stirred, tormented
by that vision of Youth taking things hard, Jolyon got out of his
chair, and went to the window. The boy was nowhere visible. And he
passed out. If one could take any help to him now&mdash;one
must!</p>

<p>He traversed the shrubbery, glanced into the walled
garden&mdash;no Jon! Nor where the peaches and the apricots were
beginning to swell and colour. He passed the Cupressus trees, dark
and spiral, into the meadow. Where had the boy got to? Had he
rushed down to the coppice&mdash;his old hunting-ground? Jolyon
crossed the rows of hay. They would cock it on Monday and be
carrying the day after, if rain held off. Often they had crossed
this field together&mdash;hand in hand, when Jon was a little chap.
Dash it! The golden age was over by the time one was ten! He came
to the pond, where flies and gnats were dancing over a bright reedy
surface; and on into the coppice. It was cool there, fragrant of
larches. Still no Jon! He called. No answer! On the log seat he sat
down, nervous, anxious, forgetting his own physical sensations. He
had been wrong to let the boy get away with that letter; he ought
to have kept him under his eye from the start! Greatly troubled, he
got up to retrace his steps. At the farm-buildings he called again,
and looked into the dark cow-house. There in the cool, and the
scent of vanilla and ammonia, away from flies, the three Alderneys
were chewing the quiet cud; just milked, waiting for evening, to be
turned out again into the lower field. One turned a lazy head, a
lustrous eye; Jolyon could see the slobber on its grey lower lip.
He saw everything with passionate clearness, in the agitation of
his nerves&mdash;all that in his time he had adored and tried to
paint&mdash;wonder of light and shade and colour. No wonder the
legend put Christ into a manger&mdash;what more devotional than the
eyes and moon-white horns of a chewing cow in the warm dusk! He
called again. No answer! And he hurried away out of the coppice,
past the pond, up the hill. Oddly ironical&mdash;now he came to
think of it&mdash;if Jon had taken the gruel of his discovery down
in the coppice where his mother and Bosinney in those old days had
made the plunge of acknowledging their love. Where he himself, on
the log seat the Sunday morning he came back from Paris, had
realised to the full that Irene had become the world to him. That
would have been the place for Irony to tear the veil from before
the eyes of Irene's boy! But he was not here! Where had he got to?
One must find the poor chap!</p>

<p>A gleam of sun had come, sharpening to his hurrying senses all
the beauty of the afternoon, of the tall trees and lengthening
shadows, of the blue, and the white clouds, the scent of the hay,
and the cooing of the pigeons; and the flower shapes standing tall.
He came to the rosery, and the beauty of the roses in that sudden
sunlight seemed to him unearthly. "Rose, you Spaniard!" Wonderful
three words! There she had stood by that bush of dark red roses;
had stood to read and decide that Jon must know it all! He knew all
now! Had she chosen wrong? He bent and sniffed a rose, its petals
brushed his nose and trembling lips; nothing so soft as a
rose-leaf's velvet, except her neck&mdash;Irene! On across the lawn
he went, up the slope, to the oak-tree. Its top alone was
glistening, for the sudden sun was away over the house; the lower
shade was thick, blessedly cool&mdash;he was greatly overheated. He
paused a minute with his hand on the rope of the swing&mdash;Jolly,
Holly&mdash;Jon! The old swing! And suddenly, he felt
horribly&mdash;deadly ill. 'I've over done it!' he thought: 'by
Jove! I've overdone it&mdash;after all!' He staggered up toward the
terrace, dragged himself up the steps, and fell against the wall of
the house. He leaned there gasping, his face buried in the
honey-suckle that he and she had taken such trouble with that it
might sweeten the air which drifted in. Its fragrance mingled with
awful pain. 'My love!' he thought; 'the boy!' And with a great
effort he tottered in through the long window, and sank into old
Jolyon's chair. The book was there, a pencil in it; he caught it
up, scribbled a word on the open page...His hand dropped...So it
was like this&mdash;was it?...</p>

<p>There was a great wrench; and darkness...</p>

<hr>

<h3>III.&mdash;IRENE</h3>

<p>When Jon rushed away with the letter in his hand, he ran along
the terrace and round the corner of the house, in fear and
confusion. Leaning against the creepered wall he tore open the
letter. It was long&mdash;very long! This added to his fear, and he
began reading. When he came to the words: "It was Fleur's father
that she married," everything seemed to spin before him. He was
close to a window, and entering by it, he passed, through
music-room and hall, up to his bedroom. Dipping his face in cold
water, he sat on his bed, and went on reading, dropping each
finished page on the bed beside him. His father's writing was easy
to read&mdash;he knew it so well, though he had never had a letter
from him one quarter so long. He read with a dull
feeling&mdash;imagination only half at work. He best grasped, on
that first reading, the pain his father must have had in writing
such a letter. He let the last sheet fall, and in a sort of mental,
moral helplessness began to read the first again. It all seemed to
him disgusting&mdash;dead and disgusting. Then, suddenly, a hot
wave of horrified emotion tingled through him. He buried his face
in his hands. His mother! Fleur's father! He took up the letter
again, and read on mechanically. And again came the feeling that it
was all dead and disgusting; his own love so different! This letter
said his mother&mdash;and her father! An awful letter!</p>

<p>Property! Could there be men who looked on women as their
property? Faces seen in street and countryside came thronging up
before him&mdash;red, stock-fish faces; hard, dull faces; prim, dry
faces; violent faces; hundreds, thousands of them! How could he
know what men who had such faces thought and did? He held his head
in his hands and groaned. His mother! He caught up the letter and
read on again: "horror and aversion-alive in her to-day...your
children...grandchildren...of a man who once owned your mother as a
man might own a slave..." He got up from his bed. This cruel
shadowy past, lurking there to murder his love and Fleur's, was
true, or his father could never have written it. 'Why didn't they
tell me the first thing,' he thought, 'the day I first saw Fleur?
They knew I'd seen her. They were afraid,
and&mdash;now&mdash;I've&mdash;got it!' Overcome by misery too
acute for thought or reason, he crept into a dusky corner of the
room and sat down on the floor. He sat there, like some unhappy
little animal. There was comfort in dusk, and the floor&mdash;as if
he were back in those days when he played his battles sprawling all
over it. He sat there huddled, his hair ruffled, his hands clasped
round his knees, for how long he did not know. He was wrenched from
his blank wretchedness by the sound of the door opening from his
mother's room. The blinds were down over the windows of his room,
shut up in his absence, and from where he sat he could only hear a
rustle, her footsteps crossing, till beyond the bed he saw her
standing before his dressing-table. She had something in her hand.
He hardly breathed, hoping she would not see him, and go away. He
saw her touch things on the table as if they had some virtue in
them, then face the window-grey from head to foot like a ghost. The
least turn of her head, and she must see him! Her lips moved: "Oh!
Jon!" She was speaking to herself; the tone of her voice troubled
Jon's heart. He saw in her hand a little photograph. She held it
toward the light, looking at it&mdash;very small. He knew
it&mdash;one of himself as a tiny boy, which she always kept in her
bag. His heart beat fast. And, suddenly as if she had heard it, she
turned her eyes and saw him. At the gasp she gave, and the movement
of her hands pressing the photograph against her breast, he
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me."</p>

<p>She moved over to the bed, and sat down on it, quite close to
him, her hands still clasping her breast, her feet among the sheets
of the letter which had slipped to the floor. She saw them, and her
hands grasped the edge of the bed. She sat very upright, her dark
eyes fixed on him. At last she spoke.</p>

<p>"Well, Jon, you know, I see."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You've seen Father?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>There was a long silence, till she said:</p>

<p>"Oh! my darling!"</p>

<p>"It's all right." The emotions in him were so, violent and so
mixed that he dared not move&mdash;resentment, despair, and yet a
strange yearning for the comfort of her hand on his forehead.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>There was another long silence, then she got up. She stood a
moment, very still, made a little movement with her hand, and said:
"My darling boy, my most darling boy, don't think of me&mdash;think
of yourself," and, passing round the foot of the bed, went back
into her room.</p>

<p>Jon turned&mdash;curled into a sort of ball, as might a
hedgehog&mdash;into the corner made by the two walls.</p>

<p>He must have been twenty minutes there before a cry roused him.
It came from the terrace below. He got up, scared. Again came the
cry: "Jon!" His mother was calling! He ran out and down the stairs,
through the empty dining-room into the study. She was kneeling
before the old armchair, and his father was lying back quite white,
his head on his breast, one of his hands resting on an open book,
with a pencil clutched in it&mdash;more strangely still than
anything he had ever seen. She looked round wildly, and said:</p>

<p>"Oh! Jon&mdash;he's dead&mdash;he's dead!"</p>

<p>Jon flung himself down, and reaching over the arm of the chair,
where he had lately been sitting, put his lips to the forehead. Icy
cold! How could&mdash;how could Dad be dead, when only an hour
ago&mdash;! His mother's arms were round the knees; pressing her
breast against them. "Why&mdash;why wasn't I with him?" he heard
her whisper. Then he saw the tottering word "Irene" pencilled on
the open page, and broke down himself. It was his first sight of
human death, and its unutterable stillness blotted from him all
other emotion; all else, then, was but preliminary to this! All
love and life, and joy, anxiety, and sorrow, all movement, light
and beauty, but a beginning to this terrible white stillness. It
made a dreadful mark on him; all seemed suddenly little, futile,
short. He mastered himself at last, got up, and raised her.</p>

<p>"Mother! don't cry&mdash;Mother!"</p>

<p>Some hours later, when all was done that had to be, and his
mother was lying down, he saw his father alone, on the bed, covered
with a white sheet. He stood for a long time gazing at that face
which had never looked angry&mdash;always whimsical, and kind. "To
be kind and keep your end up&mdash;there's nothing else in it," he
had once heard his father say. How wonderfully Dad had acted up to
that philosophy! He understood now that his father had known for a
long time past that this would come suddenly&mdash;known, and not
said a word. He gazed with an awed and passionate reverence. The
loneliness of it&mdash;just to spare his mother and himself! His
own trouble seemed small while he was looking at that face. The
word scribbled on the page! The farewell word! Now his mother had
no one but himself! He went up close to the dead face&mdash;not
changed at all, and yet completely changed. He had heard his father
say once that he did not believe in consciousness surviving death,
or that if it did it might be just survival till the natural age
limit of the body had been reached&mdash;the natural term of its
inherent vitality; so that if the body were broken by accident,
excess, violent disease, consciousness might still persist till, in
the course of Nature uninterfered with, it would naturally have
faded out. It had struck him because he had never heard any one
else suggest it. When the heart failed like this&mdash;surely it
was not quite natural! Perhaps his father's consciousness was in
the room with him. Above the bed hung a picture of his father's
father. Perhaps his consciousness, too, was still alive; and his
brother's&mdash;his half-brother, who had died in the Transvaal.
Were they all gathered round this bed? Jon kissed the forehead, and
stole back to his own room. The door between it and his mother's
was ajar; she had evidently been in&mdash;everything was ready for
him, even some biscuits and hot milk, and the letter no longer on
the floor. He ate and drank, watching the last light fade. He did
not try to see into the future&mdash;just stared at the dark
branches of the oak-tree, level with his window, and felt as if
life had stopped. Once in the night, turning in his heavy sleep, he
was conscious of something white and still, beside his bed, and
started up.</p>

<p>His mother's voice said:</p>

<p>"It's only I, Jon dear!" Her hand pressed his forehead gently
back; her white figure disappeared.</p>

<p>Alone! He fell heavily asleep again, and dreamed he saw his
mother's name crawling on his bed.</p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;SOAMES COGITATES</h3>

<p>The announcement in The Times of his cousin Jolyon's death
affected Soames quite simply. So that chap was gone! There had
never been a time in their two lives when love had not been lost
between them. That quick-blooded sentiment hatred had run its
course long since in Soames' heart, and he had refused to allow any
recrudescence, but he considered this early decease a piece of
poetic justice. For twenty years the fellow had enjoyed the
reversion of his wife and house, and&mdash;he was dead! The
obituary notice, which appeared a little later, paid
Jolyon&mdash;he thought&mdash;too much attention. It spoke of that
"diligent and agreeable painter whose work we have come to look on
as typical of the best late-Victorian water-colour art." Soames,
who had almost mechanically preferred Mole, Morpin, and Caswell
Baye, and had always sniffed quite audibly when he came to one of
his cousin's on the line, turned The Times with a crackle.</p>

<p>He had to go up to Town that morning on Forsyte affairs, and was
fully conscious of Gradman's glance sidelong over his spectacles.
The old clerk had about him an aura of regretful congratulation. He
smelled, as it were, of old days. One could almost hear him
thinking: "Mr. Jolyon, ye-es&mdash;just my age, and
gone&mdash;dear, dear! I dare say she feels it. She was a
mice-lookin' woman. Flesh is flesh! They've given 'im a notice in
the papers. Fancy!" His atmosphere in fact caused Soames to handle
certain leases and conversions with exceptional swiftness.</p>

<p>"About that settlement on Miss Fleur, Mr. Soames?"</p>

<p>"I've thought better of that," answered Soames shortly.</p>

<p>"Ah! I'm glad of that. I thought you were a little hasty. The
times do change."</p>

<p>How this death would affect Fleur had begun to trouble Soames.
He was not certain that she knew of it&mdash;she seldom looked at
the paper, never at the births, marriages, and deaths.</p>

<p>He pressed matters on, and made his way to Green Street for
lunch. Winifred was almost doleful. Jack Cardigan had broken a
splashboard, so far as one could make out, and would not be "fit"
for some time. She could not get used to the idea.</p>

<p>"Did Profond ever get off?" he said suddenly.</p>

<p>"He got off," replied Winifred, "but where&mdash;I don't
know."</p>

<p>Yes, there it was&mdash;impossible to tell anything! Not that he
wanted to know. Letters from Annette were coming from Dieppe, where
she and her mother were staying.</p>

<p>"You saw that fellow's death, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Winifred. "I'm sorry for&mdash;for his children. He
was very amiable." Soames uttered a rather queer sound. A suspicion
of the old deep truth&mdash;that men were judged in this world
rather by what they were than by what they did&mdash;crept and
knocked resentfully at the back doors of his mind.</p>

<p>"I know there was a superstition to that effect," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"One must do him justice now he's dead."</p>

<p>"I should like to have done him justice before," said Soames;
"but I never had the chance. Have you got a 'Baronetage' here?"</p>

<p>"Yes; in that bottom row."</p>

<p>Soames took out a fat red book, and ran over the leaves.</p>

<p>"Mont-Sir Lawrence, 9th Bt., cr. 1620, e. s. of Geoffrey, 8th
Bt., and Lavinia, daur. of Sir Charles Muskham, Bt., of Muskham
Hall, Shrops: marr. 1890 Emily, daur. of Conway Charwell, Esq., of
Condaford Grange, co. Oxon; 1 son, heir Michael Conway, b. 1895, 2
daurs. Residence: Lippinghall Manor, Folwell, Bucks. Clubs:
Snooks': Coffee House: Aeroplane. See Bidicott."</p>

<p>"H'm!" he said. "Did you ever know a publisher?"</p>

<p>"Uncle Timothy."</p>

<p>"Alive, I mean."</p>

<p>"Monty knew one at his Club. He brought him here to dinner once.
Monty was always thinking of writing a book, you know, about how to
make money on the turf. He tried to interest that man."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"He put him on to a horse&mdash;for the Two Thousand. We didn't
see him again. He was rather smart, if I remember."</p>

<p>"Did it win?"</p>

<p>"No; it ran last, I think. You know Monty really was quite
clever in his way."</p>

<p>"Was he?" said Soames. "Can you see any connection between a
sucking baronet and publishing?"</p>

<p>"People do all sorts of things nowadays," replied Winifred. "The
great stunt seems not to be idle&mdash;so different from our time.
To do nothing was the thing then. But I suppose it'll come
again."</p>

<p>"This young Mont that I'm speaking of is very sweet on Fleur. If
it would put an end to that other affair I might encourage it."</p>

<p>"Has he got style?" asked Winifred.</p>

<p>"He's no beauty; pleasant enough, with some scattered brains.
There's a good deal of land, I believe. He seems genuinely
attached. But I don't know."</p>

<p>"No," murmured Winifred; "it's&mdash;very difficult. I always
found it best to do nothing. It is such a bore about Jack; now we
shan't get away till after Bank Holiday. Well, the people are
always amusing, I shall go into the Park and watch them."</p>

<p>"If I were you," said Soames, "I should have a country cottage,
and be out of the way of holidays and strikes when you want."</p>

<p>"The country bores me," answered Winifred, "and I found the
railway strike quite exciting."</p>

<p>Winifred had always been noted for sang-froid.</p>

<p>Soames took his leave. All the way down to Reading he debated
whether he should tell Fleur of that boy's father's death. It did
not alter the situation except that he would be independent now,
and only have his mother's opposition to encounter. He would come
into a lot of money, no doubt, and perhaps the house&mdash;the
house built for Irene and himself&mdash;the house whose architect
had wrought his domestic ruin. His daughter&mdash;mistress of that
house! That would be poetic justice! Soames uttered a little
mirthless laugh. He had designed that house to re-establish his
failing union, meant it for the seat of his descendants, if he
could have induced Irene to give him one! Her son and Fleur! Their
children would be, in some sort, offspring of the union between
himself and her!</p>

<p>The theatricality in that thought was repulsive to his sober
sense. And yet&mdash;it would be the easiest and wealthiest way out
of the impasse, now that Jolyon was gone. The juncture of two
Forsyte fortunes had a kind of conservative charm. And
she&mdash;Irene-would be linked to him once more. Nonsense! Absurd!
He put the notion from his head.</p>

<p>On arriving home he heard the click of billiard-balls, and
through the window saw young Mont sprawling over the table. Fleur,
with her cue akimbo, was watching with a smile. How pretty she
looked! No wonder that young fellow was out of his mind about her.
A title&mdash;land! There was little enough in land, these days;
perhaps less in a title. The old Forsytes had always had a kind of
contempt for titles, rather remote and artificial things&mdash;not
worth the money they cost, and having to do with the Court. They
had all had that feeling in differing measure&mdash;Soames
remembered. Swithin, indeed, in his most expansive days had once
attended a Levee. He had come away saying he shouldn't go
again&mdash;"all that small fry." It was suspected that he had
looked too big in knee-breeches. Soames remembered how his own
mother had wished to be presented because of the fashionable nature
of the performance, and how his father had put his foot down with
unwonted decision. What did she want with that
peacocking&mdash;wasting time and money; there was nothing in
it!</p>

<p>The instinct which had made and kept the English Commons the
chief power in the State, a feeling that their own world was good
enough and a little better than any other because it was their
world, had kept the old Forsytes singularly free of "flummery," as
Nicholas had been wont to call it when he had the gout. Soames'
generation, more self-conscious and ironical, had been saved by a
sense of Swithin in knee-breeches. While the third and the fourth
generation, as it seemed to him, laughed at everything.</p>

<p>However, there was no harm in the young fellow's being heir to a
title and estate&mdash;a thing one couldn't help. He entered
quietly, as Mont missed his shot. He noted the young man's eyes,
fixed on Fleur bending over in her turn; and the adoration in them
almost touched him.</p>

<p>She paused with the cue poised on the bridge of her slim hand,
and shook her crop of short dark chestnut hair.</p>

<p>"I shall never do it."</p>

<p>"'Nothing venture.'"</p>

<p>"All right." The cue struck, the ball rolled. "There!"</p>

<p>"Bad luck! Never mind!"</p>

<p>Then they saw him, and Soames said:</p>

<p>"I'll mark for you."</p>

<p>He sat down on the raised seat beneath the marker, trim and
tired, furtively studying those two young faces. When the game was
over Mont came up to him.</p>

<p>"I've started in, sir. Rum game, business, isn't it? I suppose
you saw a lot of human nature as a solicitor."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you what I've noticed: People are quite on the
wrong tack in offering less than they can afford to give; they
ought to offer more, and work backward."</p>

<p>Soames raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Suppose the more is accepted?"</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter a little bit," said Mont; "it's much more
paying to abate a price than to increase it. For instance, say we
offer an author good terms&mdash;he naturally takes them. Then we
go into it, find we can't publish at a decent profit and tell him
so. He's got confidence in us because we've been generous to him,
and he comes down like a lamb, and bears us no malice. But if we
offer him poor terms at the start, he doesn't take them, so we have
to advance them to get him, and he thinks us damned screws into the
bargain.</p>

<p>"Try buying pictures on that system," said Soames; "an offer
accepted is a contract&mdash;haven't you learned that?"</p>

<p>Young Mont turned his head to where Fleur was standing in the
window.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I wish I had. Then there's another thing. Always
let a man off a bargain if he wants to be let off."</p>

<p>"As advertisement?" said Soames dryly.</p>

<p>"Of course it is; but I meant on principle."</p>

<p>"Does your firm work on those lines?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Mont, "but it'll come."</p>

<p>"And they will go."</p>

<p>"No, really, sir. I'm making any number of observations, and
they all confirm my theory. Human nature is consistently underrated
in business, people do themselves out of an awful lot of pleasure
and profit by that. Of course, you must be perfectly genuine and
open, but that's easy if you feel it. The more human and generous
you are the better chance you've got in business."</p>

<p>Soames rose.</p>

<p>"Are you a partner?"</p>

<p>"Not for six months, yet."</p>

<p>"The rest of the firm had better make haste and retire."</p>

<p>Mont laughed.</p>

<p>"You'll see," he said. "There's going to be a big change. The
possessive principle has got its shutters up."</p>

<p>"What?" said Soames.</p>

<p>"The house is to let! Good-bye, sir; I'm off now."</p>

<p>Soames watched his daughter give her hand, saw her wince at the
squeeze it received, and distinctly heard the young man's sigh as
he passed out. Then she came from the window, trailing her finger
along the mahogany edge of the billiard-table. Watching her, Soames
knew that she was going to ask him something. Her finger felt round
the last pocket, and she looked up.</p>

<p>"Have you done anything to stop Jon writing to me, Father?"</p>

<p>Soames shook his head.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen, then?" he said. "His father died just a week
ago to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>In her startled, frowning face he saw the instant struggle to
apprehend what this would mean.</p>

<p>"Poor Jon! Why didn't you tell me, Father?"</p>

<p>"I never know!" said Soames slowly; "you don't confide in
me."</p>

<p>"I would, if you'd help me, dear."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall."</p>

<p>Fleur clasped her hands. "Oh! darling&mdash;when one wants a
thing fearfully, one doesn't think of other people. Don't be angry
with me."</p>

<p>Soames put out his hand, as if pushing away an aspersion.</p>

<p>"I'm cogitating," he said. What on earth had made him use a word
like that! "Has young Mont been bothering you again?"</p>

<p>Fleur smiled. "Oh! Michael! He's always bothering; but he's such
a good sort&mdash;I don't mind him."</p>

<p>"Well," said Soames, "I'm tired; I shall go and have a nap
before dinner."</p>

<p>He went up to his picture-gallery, lay down on the couch there,
and closed his eyes. A terrible responsibility this girl of
his&mdash;whose mother was&mdash;ah! what was she? A terrible
responsibility! Help her&mdash;how could he help her? He could not
alter the fact that he was her father. Or that Irene&mdash;! What
was it young Mont had said&mdash;some nonsense about the possessive
instinct&mdash;shutters up&mdash;To let? Silly!</p>

<p>The sultry air, charged with a scent of meadow-sweet, of river
and roses, closed on his senses, drowsing them.</p>

<hr>

<h3>V.&mdash;THE FIXED IDEA</h3>

<p>"The fixed idea," which has outrun more constables than any
other form of human disorder, has never more speed and stamina than
when it takes the avid guise of love. To hedges and ditches, and
doors, to humans without ideas fixed or otherwise, to perambulators
and the contents sucking their fixed ideas, even to the other
sufferers from this fast malady&mdash;the fixed idea of love pays
no attention. It runs with eyes turned inward to its own light,
oblivious of all other stars. Those with the fixed ideas that human
happiness depends on their art, on vivisecting dogs, on hating
foreigners, on paying supertax, on remaining Ministers, on making
wheels go round, on preventing their neighbours from being
divorced, on conscientious objection, Greek roots, Church dogma,
paradox and superiority to everybody else, with other forms of
ego-mania&mdash;all are unstable compared with him or her whose
fixed idea is the possession of some her or him. And though Fleur,
those chilly summer days, pursued the scattered life of a little
Forsyte whose frocks are paid for, and whose business is pleasure,
she was&mdash;as Winifred would have said in the latest fashion of
speech&mdash;"honest to God" indifferent to it all. She wished and
wished for the moon, which sailed in cold skies above the river or
the Green Park when she went to Town. She even kept Jon's letters,
covered with pink silk, on her heart, than which in days when
corsets were so low, sentiment so despised, and chests so out of
fashion, there could, perhaps, have been no greater proof of the
fixity of her idea.</p>

<p>After hearing of his father's death, she wrote to Jon, and
received his answer three days later on her return from a river
picnic. It was his first letter since their meeting at June's. She
opened it with misgiving, and read it with dismay.</p>

<p>"Since I saw you I've heard everything about the past. I won't
tell it you&mdash;I think you knew when we met at June's. She says
you did. If you did, Fleur, you ought to have told me. I expect you
only heard your father's side of it. I have heard my mother's. It's
dreadful. Now that she's so sad I can't do anything to hurt her
more. Of course, I long for you all day, but I don't believe now
that we shall ever come together&mdash;there's something too strong
pulling us apart."</p>

<p>So! Her deception had found her out. But Jon&mdash;she
felt&mdash;had forgiven that. It was what he said of his mother
which caused the guttering in her heart and the weak sensation in
her legs.</p>

<p>Her first impulse was to reply&mdash;her second, not to reply.
These impulses were constantly renewed in the days which followed,
while desperation grew within her. She was not her father's child
for nothing. The tenacity which had at once made and undone Soames
was her backbone, too, frilled and embroidered by French grace and
quickness. Instinctively she conjugated the verb "to have" always
with the pronoun "I." She concealed, however, all signs of her
growing desperation, and pursued such river pleasures as the winds
and rain of a disagreeable July permitted, as if she had no care in
the world; nor did any "sucking baronet" ever neglect the business
of a publisher more consistently than her attendant spirit, Michael
Mont.</p>

<p>To Soames she was a puzzle. He was almost deceived by this
careless gaiety. Almost&mdash;because he did not fail to mark her
eyes often fixed on nothing, and the film of light shining from her
bedroom window late at night. What was she thinking and brooding
over into small hours when she ought to have been asleep? But he
dared not ask what was in her mind; and, since that one little talk
in the billiard-room, she said nothing to him.</p>

<p>In this taciturn condition of affairs it chanced that Winifred
invited them to lunch and to go afterward to "a most amusing little
play, 'The Beggar's Opera'" and would they bring a man to make
four? Soames, whose attitude toward theatres was to go to nothing,
accepted, because Fleur's attitude was to go to everything. They
motored up, taking Michael Mont, who, being in his seventh heaven,
was found by Winifred "very amusing." "The Beggar's Opera" puzzled
Soames. The people were very unpleasant, the whole thing very
cynical. Winifred was "intrigued"&mdash;by the dresses. The music,
too, did not displease her. At the Opera, the night before, she had
arrived too early for the Russian Ballet, and found the stage
occupied by singers, for a whole hour pale or apoplectic from
terror lest by some dreadful inadvertence they might drop into a
tune. Michael Mont was enraptured with the whole thing. And all
three wondered what Fleur was thinking of it. But Fleur was not
thinking of it. Her fixed idea stood on the stage and sang with
Polly Peachum, mimed with Filch, danced with Jenny Diver, postured
with Lucy Lockit, kissed, trolled, and cuddled with Macheath. Her
lips might smile, her hands applaud, but the comic old masterpiece
made no more impression on her than if it had been pathetic, like a
modern "Revue." When they embarked in the car to return, she ached
because Jon was not sitting next her instead of Michael Mont. When,
at some jolt, the young man's arm touched hers as if by accident,
she only thought: 'If that were Jon's arm!' When his cheerful
voice, tempered by her proximity, murmured above the sound of the
car's progress, she smiled and answered, thinking: 'If that were
Jon's voice!' and when once he said, "Fleur, you look a perfect
angel in that dress!" she answered, "Oh, do you like it?" thinking,
'If only Jon could see it!'</p>

<p>During this drive she took a resolution. She would go to Robin
Hill and see him&mdash;alone; she would take the car, without word
beforehand to him or to her father. It was nine days since his
letter, and she could wait no longer. On Monday she would go! The
decision made her well disposed toward young Mont. With something
to look forward to she could afford to tolerate and respond. He
might stay to dinner; propose to her as usual; dance with her,
press her hand, sigh&mdash;do what he liked. He was only a nuisance
when he interfered with her fixed idea. She was even sorry for him
so far as it was possible to be sorry for anybody but herself just
now. At dinner he seemed to talk more wildly than usual about what
he called "the death of the close borough"&mdash;she paid little
attention, but her father seemed paying a good deal, with the smile
on his face which meant opposition, if not anger.</p>

<p>"The younger generation doesn't think as you do, sir; does it,
Fleur?"</p>

<p>Fleur shrugged her shoulders&mdash;the younger generation was
just Jon, and she did not know what he was thinking.</p>

<p>"Young people will think as I do when they're my age, Mr. Mont.
Human nature doesn't change."</p>

<p>"I admit that, sir; but the forms of thought change with the
times. The pursuit of self-interest is a form of thought that's
going out."</p>

<p>"Indeed! To mind one's own business is not a form of thought,
Mr. Mont, it's an instinct."</p>

<p>Yes, when Jon was the business!</p>

<p>"But what is one's business, sir? That's the point. Everybody's
business is going to be one's business. Isn't it, Fleur?"</p>

<p>Fleur only smiled.</p>

<p>"If not," added young Mont, "there'll be blood."</p>

<p>"People have talked like that from time immemorial"</p>

<p>"But you'll admit, sir, that the sense of property is dying
out?"</p>

<p>"I should say increasing among those who have none."</p>

<p>"Well, look at me! I'm heir to an entailed estate. I don't want
the thing; I'd cut the entail to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You're not married, and you don't know what you're talking
about."</p>

<p>Fleur saw the young man's eyes turn rather piteously upon
her.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean that marriage&mdash;?" he began.</p>

<p>"Society is built on marriage," came from between her father's
close lips; "marriage and its consequences. Do you want to do away
with it?"</p>

<p>Young Mont made a distracted gesture. Silence brooded over the
dinner table, covered with spoons bearing the Forsyte crest&mdash;a
pheasant proper&mdash;under the electric light in an alabaster
globe. And outside, the river evening darkened, charged with heavy
moisture and sweet scents.</p>

<p>'Monday,' thought Fleur; 'Monday!'</p>

<hr>

<h3>VI.&mdash;DESPERATE</h3>

<p>The weeks which followed the death of his father were sad and
empty to the only Jolyon Forsyte left. The necessary forms and
ceremonies&mdash;the reading of the Will, valuation of the estate,
distribution of the legacies&mdash;were enacted over the head, as
it were, of one not yet of age. Jolyon was cremated. By his special
wish no one attended that ceremony, or wore black for him. The
succession of his property, controlled to some extent by old
Jolyon's Will, left his widow in possession of Robin Hill, with two
thousand five hundred pounds a year for life. Apart from this the
two Wills worked together in some complicated way to insure that
each of Jolyon's three children should have an equal share in their
grandfather's and father's property in the future as in the
present, save only that Jon, by virtue of his sex, would have
control of his capital when he was twenty-one, while June and Holly
would only have the spirit of theirs, in order that their children
might have the body after them. If they had no children, it would
all come to Jon if he outlived them; and since June was fifty, and
Holly nearly forty, it was considered in Lincoln's Inn Fields that
but for the cruelty of income tax, young Jon would be as warm a man
as his grandfather when he died. All this was nothing to Jon, and
little enough to his mother. It was June who did everything needful
for one who had left his affairs in perfect order. When she had
gone, and those two were alone again in the great house, alone with
death drawing them together, and love driving them apart, Jon
passed very painful days secretly disgusted and disappointed with
himself. His mother would look at him with such a patient sadness
which yet had in it an instinctive pride, as if she were reserving
her defence. If she smiled he was angry that his answering smile
should be so grudging and unnatural. He did not judge or condemn
her; that was all too remote&mdash;indeed, the idea of doing so had
never come to him. No! he was grudging and unnatural because he
couldn't have what he wanted be cause of her. There was one
alleviation&mdash;much to do in connection with his father's
career, which could not be safely entrusted to June, though she had
offered to undertake it. Both Jon and his mother had felt that if
she took his portfolios, unexhibited drawings and unfinished
matter, away with her, the work would encounter such icy blasts
from Paul Post and other frequenters of her studio, that it would
soon be frozen out even of her warm heart. On its old-fashioned
plane and of its kind the work was good, and they could not bear
the thought of its subjection to ridicule. A one-man exhibition of
his work was the least testimony they could pay to one they had
loved; and on preparation for this they spent many hours together.
Jon came to have a curiously increased respect for his father. The
quiet tenacity with which he had converted a mediocre talent into
something really individual was disclosed by these researches.
There was a great mass of work with a rare continuity of growth in
depth and reach of vision. Nothing certainly went very deep, or
reached very high&mdash;but such as the work was, it was thorough,
conscientious, and complete. And, remembering his father's utter
absence of "side" or self-assertion, the chaffing humility with
which he had always spoken of his own efforts, ever calling himself
"an amateur," Jon could not help feeling that he had never really
known his father. To take himself seriously, yet never that he did
so, seemed to have been his ruling principle. There was something
in this which appealed to the boy, and made him heartily endorse
his mother's comment: "He had true refinement; he couldn't help
thinking of others, whatever he did. And when he took a resolution
which went counter, he did it with the minimum of
defiance&mdash;not like the Age, is it? Twice in his life he had to
go against everything; and yet it never made him bitter." Jon saw
tears running down her face, which she at once turned away from
him. She was so quiet about her loss that sometimes he had thought
she didn't feel it much. Now, as he looked at her, he felt how far
he fell short of the reserve power and dignity in both his father
and his mother. And, stealing up to her, he put his arm round her
waist. She kissed him swiftly, but with a sort of passion, and went
out of the room.</p>

<p>The studio, where they had been sorting and labelling, had once
been Holly's schoolroom, devoted to her silkworms, dried lavender,
music, and other forms of instruction. Now, at the end of July,
despite its northern and eastern aspects, a warm and slumberous air
came in between the long-faded lilac linen curtains. To redeem a
little the departed glory, as of a field that is golden and gone,
clinging to a room which its master has left, Irene had placed on
the paint-stained table a bowl of red roses. This, and Jolyon's
favourite cat, who still clung to the deserted habitat, were the
pleasant spots in that dishevelled, sad workroom. Jon, at the north
window, sniffing air mysteriously scented with warm strawberries,
heard a car drive up. The lawyers again about some nonsense! Why
did that scent so make one ache? And where did it come
from&mdash;there were no strawberry beds on this side of the house.
Instinctively he took a crumpled sheet of paper from his pocket,
and wrote down some broken words. A warmth began spreading in his
chest; he rubbed the palms of his hands together. Presently he had
jotted this:</p>

<p>"If I could make a little song A little song to soothe my heart!
I'd make it all of little things The plash of water, rub of wings,
The puffing-off of dandies crown, The hiss of raindrop spilling
down, The purr of cat, the trill of bird, And ev'ry whispering I've
heard From willy wind in leaves and grass, And all the distant
drones that pass. A song as tender and as light As flower, or
butterfly in flight; And when I saw it opening, I'd let it fly and
sing!"</p>

<p>He was still muttering it over to himself at the window, when he
heard his name called, and, turning round, saw Fleur. At that
amazing apparition, he made at first no movement and no sound,
while her clear vivid glance ravished his heart. Then he went
forward to the table, saying, "How nice of you to come!" and saw
her flinch as if he had thrown something at her.</p>

<p>"I asked for you," she said, "and they showed me up here. But I
can go away again."</p>

<p>Jon clutched the paint-stained table. Her face and figure in its
frilly frock photographed itself with such startling vividness upon
his eyes, that if she had sunk through the floor he must still have
seen her.</p>

<p>"I know I told you a lie, Jon. But I told it out of love."</p>

<p>"Yes, oh! yes! That's nothing!"</p>

<p>"I didn't answer your letter. What was the use&mdash;there
wasn't anything to answer. I wanted to see you instead." She held
out both her hands, and Jon grasped them across the table. He tried
to say something, but all his attention was given to trying not to
hurt her hands. His own felt so hard and hers so soft. She said
almost defiantly:</p>

<p>"That old story&mdash;was it so very dreadful?"</p>

<p>"Yes." In his voice, too, there was a note of defiance.</p>

<p>She dragged her hands away. "I didn't think in these days boys
were tied to their mothers' apron-strings."</p>

<p>Jon's chin went up as if he had been struck.</p>

<p>"Oh! I didn't mean it, Jon. What a horrible thing to say!"
Swiftly she came close to him. "Jon, dear; I didn't mean it."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>She had put her two hands on his shoulder, and her forehead down
on them; the brim of her hat touched his neck, and he felt it
quivering. But, in a sort of paralysis, he made no response. She
let go of his shoulder and drew away.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go, if you don't want me. But I never thought you'd
have given me up."</p>

<p>"I haven't," cried Jon, coming suddenly to life. "I can't. I'll
try again."</p>

<p>Her eyes gleamed, she swayed toward him. "Jon&mdash;I love you!
Don't give me up! If you do, I don't know what&mdash;I feel so
desperate. What does it matter&mdash;all that past-compared with
this?"</p>

<p>She clung to him. He kissed her eyes, her cheeks, her lips. But
while he kissed her he saw, the sheets of that letter fallen down
on the floor of his bedroom&mdash;his father's white dead
face&mdash;his mother kneeling before it. Fleur's whispered, "Make
her! Promise! Oh! Jon, try!" seemed childish in his ear. He felt
curiously old.</p>

<p>"I promise!" he muttered. "Only, you don't understand."</p>

<p>"She wants to spoil our lives, just because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, of what?"</p>

<p>Again that challenge in his voice, and she did not answer. Her
arms tightened round him, and he returned her kisses; but even
while he yielded, the poison worked in him, the poison of the
letter. Fleur did not know, she did not understand&mdash;she
misjudged his mother; she came from the enemy's camp! So lovely,
and he loved her so&mdash;yet, even in her embrace, he could not
help the memory of Holly's words: "I think she has a 'having'
nature," and his mother's "My darling boy, don't think of
me&mdash;think of yourself!"</p>

<p>When she was gone like a passionate dream, leaving her image on
his eyes, her kisses on his lips, such an ache in his heart, Jon
leaned in the window, listening to the car bearing her away. Still
the scent as of warm strawberries, still the little summer sounds
that should make his song; still all the promise of youth and
happiness in sighing, floating, fluttering July&mdash;and his heart
torn; yearning strong in him; hope high in him yet with its eyes
cast down, as if ashamed. The miserable task before him! If Fleur
was desperate, so was he&mdash;watching the poplars swaying, the
white clouds passing, the sunlight on the grass.</p>

<p>He waited till evening, till after their almost silent dinner,
till his mother had played to him and still he waited, feeling that
she knew what he was waiting to say. She kissed him and went
up-stairs, and still he lingered, watching the moonlight and the
moths, and that unreality of colouring which steals along and
stains a summer night. And he would have given anything to be back
again in the past&mdash;barely three months back; or away forward,
years, in the future. The present with this dark cruelty of a
decision, one way or the other, seemed impossible. He realised now
so much more keenly what his mother felt than he had at first; as
if the story in that letter had been a poisonous germ producing a
kind of fever of partisanship, so that he really felt there were
two camps, his mother's and his&mdash;Fleur's and her father's. It
might be a dead thing, that old tragic ownership and enmity, but
dead things were poisonous till time had cleaned them away. Even
his love felt tainted, less illusioned, more of the earth, and with
a treacherous lurking doubt lest Fleur, like her father, might want
to own; not articulate, just a stealing haunt, horribly unworthy,
which crept in and about the ardour of his memories, touched with
its tarnishing breath the vividness and grace of that charmed face
and figure&mdash;a doubt, not real enough to convince him of its
presence, just real enough to deflower a perfect faith. And perfect
faith, to Jon, not yet twenty, was essential. He still had Youth's
eagerness to give with both hands, to take with neither&mdash;to
give lovingly to one who had his own impulsive generosity. Surely
she had! He got up from the window-seat and roamed in the big grey
ghostly room, whose walls were hung with silvered canvas. This
house his father said in that death-bed letter&mdash;had been built
for his mother to live in&mdash;with Fleur's father! He put out his
hand in the half-dark, as if to grasp the shadowy hand of the dead.
He clenched, trying to feel the thin vanished fingers of his
father; to squeeze them, and reassure him that he&mdash;he was on
his father's side. Tears, prisoned within him, made his eyes feel
dry and hot. He went back to the window. It was warmer, not so
eerie, more comforting outside, where the moon hung golden, three
days off full; the freedom of the night was comforting. If only
Fleur and he had met on some desert island without a past&mdash;and
Nature for their house! Jon had still his high regard for desert
islands, where breadfruit grew, and the water was blue above the
coral. The night was deep, was free&mdash;there was enticement in
it; a lure, a promise, a refuge from entanglement, and love!
Milksop tied to his mother's...! His cheeks burned. He shut the
window, drew curtains over it, switched off the lighted sconce, and
went up-stairs.</p>

<p>The door of his room was open, the light turned up; his mother,
still in her evening gown, was standing at the window. She turned
and said:</p>

<p>"Sit down, Jon; let's talk." She sat down on the window-seat,
Jon on his bed. She had her profile turned to him, and the beauty
and grace of her figure, the delicate line of the brow, the nose,
the neck, the strange and as it were remote refinement of her,
moved him. His mother never belonged to her surroundings. She came
into them from somewhere&mdash;as it were! What was she going to
say to him, who had in his heart such things to say to her?</p>

<p>"I know Fleur came to-day. I'm not surprised." It was as though
she had added: "She is her father's daughter!" And Jon's heart
hardened. Irene went on quietly:</p>

<p>"I have Father's letter. I picked it up that night and kept it.
Would you like it back, dear?"</p>

<p>Jon shook his head.</p>

<p>"I had read it, of course, before he gave it to you. It didn't
quite do justice to my criminality."</p>

<p>"Mother!" burst from Jon's lips.</p>

<p>"He put it very sweetly, but I know that in marrying Fleur's
father without love I did a dreadful thing. An unhappy marriage,
Jon, can play such havoc with other lives besides one's own. You
are fearfully young, my darling, and fearfully loving. Do you think
you can possibly be happy with this girl?"</p>

<p>Staring at her dark eyes, darker now from pain, Jon answered</p>

<p>"Yes; oh! yes&mdash;if you could be."</p>

<p>Irene smiled.</p>

<p>"Admiration of beauty and longing for possession are not love.
If yours were another case like mine, Jon&mdash;where the deepest
things are stifled; the flesh joined, and the spirit at war!"</p>

<p>"Why should it, Mother? You think she must be like her father,
but she's not. I've seen him."</p>

<p>Again the smile came on Irene's lips, and in Jon something
wavered; there was such irony and experience in that smile.</p>

<p>"You are a giver, Jon; she is a taker."</p>

<p>That unworthy doubt, that haunting uncertainty again! He said
with vehemence:</p>

<p>"She isn't&mdash;she isn't. It's only because I can't bear to
make you unhappy, Mother, now that Father&mdash;" He thrust his
fists against his forehead.</p>

<p>Irene got up.</p>

<p>"I told you that night, dear, not to mind me. I meant it. Think
of yourself and your own happiness! I can stand what's
left&mdash;I've brought it on myself."</p>

<p>Again the word "Mother!" burst from Jon's lips.</p>

<p>She came over to him and put her hands over his.</p>

<p>"Do you feel your head, darling?"</p>

<p>Jon shook it. What he felt was in his chest&mdash;a sort of
tearing asunder of the tissue there, by the two loves.</p>

<p>"I shall always love you the same, Jon, whatever you do. You
won't lose anything." She smoothed his hair gently, and walked
away.</p>

<p>He heard the door shut; and, rolling over on the bed, lay,
stifling his breath, with an awful held-up feeling within him.</p>

<hr>

<h3>VII.&mdash;EMBASSY</h3>

<p>Enquiring for her at tea time Soames learned that Fleur had been
out in the car since two. Three hours! Where had she gone? Up to
London without a word to him? He had never become quite reconciled
with cars. He had embraced them in principle&mdash;like the born
empiricist, or Forsyte, that he was&mdash;adopting each symptom of
progress as it came along with: "Well, we couldn't do without them
now." But in fact he found them tearing, great, smelly things.
Obliged by Annette to have one&mdash;a Rollhard with pearl-grey
cushions, electric light, little mirrors, trays for the ashes of
cigarettes, flower vases&mdash;all smelling of petrol and
stephanotis&mdash;he regarded it much as he used to regard his
brother-in-law, Montague Dartie. The thing typified all that was
fast, insecure, and subcutaneously oily in modern life. As modern
life became faster, looser, younger, Soames was becoming older,
slower, tighter, more and more in thought and language like his
father James before him. He was almost aware of it himself. Pace
and progress pleased him less and less; there was an ostentation,
too, about a car which he considered provocative in the prevailing
mood of Labour. On one occasion that fellow Sims had driven over
the only vested interest of a working man. Soames had not forgotten
the behaviour of its master, when not many people would have
stopped to put up with it. He had been sorry for the dog, and quite
prepared to take its part against the car, if that ruffian hadn't
been so outrageous. With four hours fast becoming five, and still
no Fleur, all the old car-wise feelings he had experienced in
person and by proxy balled within him, and sinking sensations
troubled the pit of his stomach. At seven he telephoned to Winifred
by trunk call. No! Fleur had not been to Green Street. Then where
was she? Visions of his beloved daughter rolled up in her pretty
frills, all blood and dust-stained, in some hideous catastrophe,
began to haunt him. He went to her room and spied among her things.
She had taken nothing&mdash;no dressing-case, no Jewellery. And
this, a relief in one sense, increased his fears of an accident.
Terrible to be helpless when his loved one was missing, especially
when he couldn't bear fuss or publicity of any kind! What should he
do if she were not back by nightfall?</p>

<p>At a quarter to eight he heard the car. A great weight lifted
from off his heart; he hurried down. She was getting out&mdash;pale
and tired-looking, but nothing wrong. He met her in the hall.</p>

<p>"You've frightened me. Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"To Robin Hill. I'm sorry, dear. I had to go; I'll tell you
afterward." And, with a flying kiss, she ran up-stairs.</p>

<p>Soames waited in the drawing-room. To Robin Hill! What did that
portend?</p>

<p>It was not a subject they could discuss at
dinner&mdash;consecrated to the susceptibilities of the butler. The
agony of nerves Soames had been through, the relief he felt at her
safety, softened his power to condemn what she had done, or resist
what she was going to do; he waited in a relaxed stupor for her
revelation. Life was a queer business. There he was at sixty-five
and no more in command of things than if he had not spent forty
years in building up security-always something one couldn't get on
terms with! In the pocket of his dinner-jacket was a letter from
Annette. She was coming back in a fortnight. He knew nothing of
what she had been doing out there. And he was glad that he did not.
Her absence had been a relief. Out of sight was out of mind! And
now she was coming back. Another worry! And the Bolderby Old Crome
was gone&mdash;Dumetrius had got it&mdash;all because that
anonymous letter had put it out of his thoughts. He furtively
remarked the strained look on his daughter's face, as if she too
were gazing at a picture that she couldn't buy. He almost wished
the War back. Worries didn't seem, then, quite so worrying. From
the caress in her voice, the look on her face, he became certain
that she wanted something from him, uncertain whether it would be
wise of him to give it her. He pushed his savoury away uneaten, and
even joined her in a cigarette.</p>

<p>After dinner she set the electric piano-player going. And he
augured the worst when she sat down on a cushion footstool at his
knee, and put her hand on his.</p>

<p>"Darling, be nice to me. I had to see Jon&mdash;he wrote to me.
He's going to try what he can do with his mother. But I've been
thinking. It's really in your hands, Father. If you'd persuade her
that it doesn't mean renewing the past in any way! That I shall
stay yours, and Jon will stay hers; that you need never see him or
her, and she need never see you or me! Only you could persuade her,
dear, because only you could promise. One can't promise for other
people. Surely it wouldn't be too awkward for you to see her just
this once now that Jon's father is dead?"</p>

<p>"Too awkward?" Soames repeated. "The whole thing's
preposterous."</p>

<p>"You know," said Fleur, without looking up, "you wouldn't mind
seeing her, really."</p>

<p>Soames was silent. Her words had expressed a truth too deep for
him to admit. She slipped her fingers between his own&mdash;hot,
slim, eager, they clung there. This child of his would corkscrew
her way into a brick wall!</p>

<p>"What am I to do if you won't, Father?" she said very
softly.</p>

<p>"I'll do anything for your happiness," said Soanies; "but this
isn't for your happiness."</p>

<p>"Oh! it is; it is!"</p>

<p>"It'll only stir things up," he said grimly.</p>

<p>"But they are stirred up. The thing is to quiet them. To make
her feel that this is just our lives, and has nothing to do with
yours or hers. You can do it, Father, I know you can."</p>

<p>"You know a great deal, then," was Soames' glum answer.</p>

<p>"If you will, Jon and I will wait a year&mdash;two years if you
like."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," murmured Soames, "that you care nothing about
what I feel."</p>

<p>Fleur pressed his hand against her cheek.</p>

<p>"I do, darling. But you wouldn't like me to be awfully
miserable."</p>

<p>How she wheedled to get her ends! And trying with all his might
to think she really cared for him&mdash;he was not sure&mdash;not
sure. All she cared for was this boy! Why should he help her to get
this boy, who was killing her affection for himself? Why should he?
By the laws of the Forsytes it was foolish! There was nothing to be
had out of it&mdash;nothing! To give her to that boy! To pass her
into the enemy's camp, under the influence of the woman who had
injured him so deeply! Slowly&mdash;inevitably&mdash;he would lose
this flower of his life! And suddenly he was conscious that his
hand was wet. His heart gave a little painful jump. He couldn't
bear her to cry. He put his other hand quickly over hers, and a
tear dropped on that, too. He couldn't go on like this! "Well,
well," he said, "I'll think it over, and do what I can. Come,
come!" If she must have it for her happiness&mdash;she must; he
couldn't refuse to help her. And lest she should begin to thank him
he got out of his chair and went up to the
piano-player&mdash;making that noise! It ran down, as he reached
it, with a faint buzz. That musical box of his nursery days: "The
Harmonious Blacksmith," "Glorious Port"&mdash;the thing had always
made him miserable when his mother set it going on Sunday
afternoons. Here it was again&mdash;the same thing, only larger,
more expensive, and now it played "The Wild, Wild Women," and "The
Policeman's Holiday," and he was no longer in black velvet with a
sky blue collar. 'Profond's right,' he thought, 'there's nothing in
it! We're all progressing to the grave!' And with that surprising
mental comment he walked out.</p>

<p>He did not see Fleur again that night. But, at breakfast, her
eyes followed him about with an appeal he could not
escape&mdash;not that he intended to try. No! He had made up his
mind to the nerve-racking business. He would go to Robin
Hill&mdash;to that house of memories. Pleasant memory&mdash;the
last! Of going down to keep that boy's father and Irene apart by
threatening divorce. He had often thought, since, that it had
clinched their union. And, now, he was going to clinch the union of
that boy with his girl. 'I don't know what I've done,' he thought,
'to have such things thrust on me!' He went up by train and down by
train, and from the station walked by the long rising lane, still
very much as he remembered it over thirty years ago. Funny&mdash;so
near London! Some one evidently was holding on to the land there.
This speculation soothed him, moving between the high hedges
slowly, so as not to get overheated, though the day was chill
enough. After all was said and done there was something real about
land, it didn't shift. Land, and good pictures! The values might
fluctuate a bit, but on the whole they were always going
up&mdash;worth holding on to, in a world where there was such a lot
of unreality, cheap building, changing fashions, such a "Here
to-day and gone to-morrow" spirit. The French were right, perhaps,
with their peasant proprietorship, though he had no opinion of the
French. One's bit of land! Something solid in it! He had heard
peasant proprietors described as a pig-headed lot; had heard young
Mont call his father a pigheaded Morning Poster&mdash;disrespectful
young devil. Well, there were worse things than being pig-headed or
reading the Morning Post. There was Profond and his tribe, and all
these Labour chaps, and loud-mouthed politicians and 'wild, wild
women'! A lot of worse things! And suddenly Soames became conscious
of feeling weak, and hot, and shaky. Sheer nerves at the meeting
before him! As Aunt Juley might have said&mdash;quoting "Superior
Dosset"&mdash;his nerves were "in a proper fautigue." He could see
the house now among its trees, the house he had watched being
built, intending it for himself and this woman, who, by such
strange fate, had lived in it with another after all! He began to
think of Dumetrius, Local Loans, and other forms of investment. He
could not afford to meet her with his nerves all shaking; he who
represented the Day of Judgment for her on earth as it was in
heaven; he, legal ownership, personified, meeting lawless beauty,
incarnate. His dignity demanded impassivity during this embassy
designed to link their offspring, who, if she had behaved herself,
would have been brother and sister. That wretched tune, "The Wild,
Wild Women," kept running in his head, perversely, for tunes did
not run there as a rule. Passing the poplars in front of the house,
he thought: 'How they've grown; I had them planted!' A maid
answered his ring.</p>

<p>"Will you say&mdash;Mr. Forsyte, on a very special matter."</p>

<p>If she realised who he was, quite probably she would not see
him. 'By George!' he thought, hardening as the tug came. 'It's a
topsy-turvy affair!'</p>

<p>The maid came back. "Would the gentleman state his business,
please?"</p>

<p>"Say it concerns Mr. Jon," said Soames.</p>

<p>And once more he was alone in that hall with the pool of
grey-white marble designed by her first lover. Ah! she had been a
bad lot&mdash;had loved two men, and not himself! He must remember
that when he came face to face with her once more. And suddenly he
saw her in the opening chink between the long heavy purple
curtains, swaying, as if in hesitation; the old perfect poise and
line, the old startled dark-eyed gravity, the old calm defensive
voice: "Will you come in, please?"</p>

<p>He passed through that opening. As in the picture-gallery and
the confectioner's shop, she seemed to him still beautiful. And
this was the first time&mdash;the very first&mdash;since he married
her seven-and-thirty years ago, that he was speaking to her without
the legal right to call her his. She was not wearing
black&mdash;one of that fellow's radical notions, he supposed.</p>

<p>"I apologise for coming," he said glumly; "but this business
must be settled one way or the other."</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>Anger at his false position, impatience of ceremony between
them, mastered him, and words came tumbling out:</p>

<p>"It's an infernal mischance; I've done my best to discourage it.
I consider my daughter crazy, but I've got into the habit of
indulging her; that's why I'm here. I suppose you're fond of your
son."</p>

<p>"Devotedly."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"It rests with him."</p>

<p>He had a sense of being met and baffled. Always&mdash;always she
had baffled him, even in those old first married days.</p>

<p>"It's a mad notion," he said.</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"If you had only&mdash;! Well&mdash;they might have been&mdash;"
he did not finish that sentence "brother and sister and all this
saved," but he saw her shudder as if he had, and stung by the sight
he crossed over to the window. Out there the trees had not
grown&mdash;they couldn't, they were old!</p>

<p>"So far as I'm concerned," he said, "you may make your mind
easy. I desire to see neither you nor your son if this marriage
comes about. Young people in these days are&mdash;are
unaccountable. But I can't bear to see my daughter unhappy. What am
I to say to her when I go back?"</p>

<p>"Please say to her as I said to you, that it rests with
Jon."</p>

<p>"You don't oppose it?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart; not with my lips."</p>

<p>Soames stood, biting his finger.</p>

<p>"I remember an evening&mdash;" he said suddenly; and was silent.
What was there&mdash;what was there in this woman that would not
fit into the four corners of his hate or condemnation? "Where is
he&mdash;your son?"</p>

<p>"Up in his father's studio, I think."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd have him down."</p>

<p>He watched her ring the bell, he watched the maid come in.</p>

<p>"Please tell Mr. Jon that I want him."</p>

<p>"If it rests with him," said Soames hurriedly, when the maid was
gone, "I suppose I may take it for granted that this unnatural
marriage will take place; in that case there'll be formalities.
Whom do I deal with&mdash;Herring's?"</p>

<p>Irene nodded.</p>

<p>"You don't propose to live with them?"</p>

<p>Irene shook her head.</p>

<p>"What happens to this house?"</p>

<p>"It will be as Jon wishes."</p>

<p>"This house," said Soames suddenly: "I had hopes when I began
it. If they live in it&mdash;their children! They say there's such
a thing as Nemesis. Do you believe in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh! You do!"</p>

<p>He had come back from the window, and was standing close to her,
who, in the curve of her grand piano, was, as it were, embayed.</p>

<p>"I'm not likely to see you again," he said slowly. "Will you
shake hands"&mdash;his lip quivered, the words came out
jerkily&mdash;"and let the past die." He held out his hand. Her
pale face grew paler, her eyes so dark, rested immovably on his,
her hands remained clasped in front of her. He heard a sound and
turned. That boy was standing in the opening of the curtains. Very
queer he looked, hardly recognisable as the young fellow he had
seen in the Gallery off Cork Street&mdash;very queer; much older,
no youth in the face at all&mdash;haggard, rigid, his hair ruffled,
his eyes deep in his head. Soames made an effort, and said with a
lift of his lip, not quite a smile nor quite a sneer:</p>

<p>"Well, young man! I'm here for my daughter; it rests with you,
it seems&mdash;this matter. Your mother leaves it in your
hands."</p>

<p>The boy continued staring at his mother's face, and made no
answer.</p>

<p>"For my daughter's sake I've brought myself to come," said
Soames. "What am I to say to her when I go back?"</p>

<p>Still looking at his mother, the boy said, quietly:</p>

<p>"Tell Fleur that it's no good, please; I must do as my father
wished before he died."</p>

<p>"Jon!"</p>

<p>"It's all right, Mother."</p>

<p>In a kind of stupefaction Soames looked from one to the other;
then, taking up hat and umbrella which he had put down on a chair,
he walked toward the curtains. The boy stood aside for him to go
by. He passed through and heard the grate of the rings as the
curtains were drawn behind him. The sound liberated something in
his chest.</p>

<p>'So that's that!' he thought, and passed out of the front
door.</p>

<hr>

<h3>VIII.&mdash;THE DARK TUNE</h3>

<p>As Soames walked away from the house at Robin Hill the sun broke
through the grey of that chill afternoon, in smoky radiance. So
absorbed in landscape painting that he seldom looked seriously for
effects of Nature out of doors&mdash;he was struck by that moody
effulgence&mdash;it mourned with a triumph suited to his own
feeling. Victory in defeat. His embassy had come to naught. But he
was rid of those people, had regained his daughter at the expense
of&mdash;her happiness. What would Fleur say to him? Would she
believe he had done his best? And under that sunlight faring on the
elms, hazels, hollies of the lane and those unexploited fields,
Soames felt dread. She would be terribly upset! He must appeal to
her pride. That boy had given her up, declared part and lot with
the woman who so long ago had given her father up! Soames clenched
his hands. Given him up, and why? What had been wrong with him? And
once more he felt the malaise of one who contemplates himself as
seen by another&mdash;like a dog who chances on his refection in a
mirror and is intrigued and anxious at the unseizable thing.</p>

<p>Not in a hurry to get home, he dined in town at the
Connoisseurs. While eating a pear it suddenly occurred to him that,
if he had not gone down to Robin Hill, the boy might not have so
decided. He remembered the expression on his face while his mother
was refusing the hand he had held out. A strange, an awkward
thought! Had Fleur cooked her own goose by trying to make too
sure?</p>

<p>He reached home at half-past nine. While the car was passing in
at one drive gate he heard the grinding sputter of a motor-cycle
passing out by the other. Young Mont, no doubt, so Fleur had not
been lonely. But he went in with a sinking heart. In the
cream-panelled drawing-room she was sitting with her elbows on her
knees, and her chin on her clasped hands, in front of a white
camellia plant which filled the fireplace. That glance at her
before she saw him renewed his dread. What was she seeing among
those white camellias?</p>

<p>"Well, Father!"</p>

<p>Soames shook his head. His tongue failed him. This was murderous
work! He saw her eyes dilate, her lips quivering.</p>

<p>"What? What? Quick, Father!"</p>

<p>"My dear," said Soames, "I&mdash;I did my best, but&mdash;" And
again he shook his head.</p>

<p>Fleur ran to him, and put a hand on each of his shoulders.</p>

<p>"She?"</p>

<p>"No," muttered Soames; "he. I was to tell you that it was no
use; he must do what his father wished before he died." He caught
her by the waist. "Come, child, don't let them hurt you. They're
not worth your little finger."</p>

<p>Fleur tore herself from his grasp.</p>

<p>"You didn't you&mdash;couldn't have tried. You&mdash;you
betrayed me, Father!"</p>

<p>Bitterly wounded, Soames gazed at her passionate figure writhing
there in front of him.</p>

<p>"You didn't try&mdash;you didn't&mdash;I was a fool! Iwon't
believe he could&mdash;he ever could! Only yesterday he&mdash;! Oh!
why did I ask you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Soames, quietly, "why did you? I swallowed my
feelings; I did my best for you, against my judgment&mdash;and this
is my reward. Good-night!"</p>

<p>With every nerve in his body twitching he went toward the
door.</p>

<p>Fleur darted after him.</p>

<p>"He gives me up? You mean that? Father!"</p>

<p>Soames turned and forced himself to answer:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Fleur. "What did you&mdash;what could you have done
in those old days?"</p>

<p>The breathless sense of really monstrous injustice cut the power
of speech in Soames' throat. What had he done! What had they done
to him!</p>

<p>And with quite unconscious dignity he put his hand on his
breast, and looked at her.</p>

<p>"It's a shame!" cried Fleur passionately.</p>

<p>Soames went out. He mounted, slow and icy, to his picture
gallery, and paced among his treasures. Outrageous! Oh! Outrageous!
She was spoiled! Ah! and who had spoiled her? He stood still before
the Goya copy. Accustomed to her own way in everything. Flower of
his life! And now that she couldn't have it! He turned to the
window for some air. Daylight was dying, the moon rising, gold
behind the poplars! What sound was that? Why! That piano thing! A
dark tune, with a thrum and a throb! She had set it
going&mdash;what comfort could she get from that? His eyes caught
movement down there beyond the lawn, under the trellis of rambler
roses and young acacia-trees, where the moonlight fell. There she
was, roaming up and down. His heart gave a little sickening jump.
What would she do under this blow? How could he tell? What did he
know of her&mdash;he had only loved her all his life&mdash;looked
on her as the apple of his eye! He knew nothing&mdash;had no
notion. There she was&mdash;and that dark tune&mdash;and the river
gleaming in the moonlight!</p>

<p>'I must go out,' he thought.</p>

<p>He hastened down to the drawing-room, lighted just as he had
left it, with the piano thrumming out that waltz, or fox-trot, or
whatever they called it in these days, and passed through on to the
verandah.</p>

<p>Where could he watch, without her seeing him? And he stole down
through the fruit garden to the boat-house. He was between her and
the river now, and his heart felt lighter. She was his daughter,
and Annette's&mdash;she wouldn't do anything foolish; but there it
was&mdash;he didn't know! From the boat house window he could see
the last acacia and the spin of her skirt when she turned in her
restless march. That tune had run down at last&mdash;thank
goodness! He crossed the floor and looked through the farther
window at the water slow-flowing past the lilies. It made little
bubbles against them, bright where a moon-streak fell. He
remembered suddenly that early morning when he had slept on the
house-boat after his father died, and she had just been
born&mdash;nearly nineteen years ago! Even now he recalled the
unaccustomed world when he woke up, the strange feeling it had
given him. That day the second passion of his life began&mdash;for
this girl of his, roaming under the acacias. What a comfort she had
been to him! And all the soreness and sense of outrage left him. If
he could make her happy again, he didn't care! An owl flew,
queeking, queeking; a bat flitted by; the moonlight brightened and
broadened on the water. How long was she going to roam about like
this! He went back to the window, and suddenly saw her coming down
to the bank. She stood quite close, on the landing-stage. And
Soames watched, clenching his hands. Should he speak to her? His
excitement was intense. The stillness of her figure, its youth, its
absorption in despair, in longing, in&mdash;itself. He would always
remember it, moonlit like that; and the faint sweet reek of the
river and the shivering of the willow leaves. She had everything in
the world that he could give her, except the one thing that she
could not have because of him! The perversity of things hurt him at
that moment, as might a fish-bone in his throat.</p>

<p>Then, with an infinite relief, he saw her turn back toward the
house. What could he give her to make amends? Pearls, travel,
horses, other young men&mdash;anything she wanted&mdash;that he
might lose the memory of her young figure lonely by the water!
There! She had set that tune going again! Why&mdash;it was a mania!
Dark, thrumming, faint, travelling from the house. It was as though
she had said: "If I can't have something to keep me going, I shall
die of this!" Soames dimly understood. Well, if it helped her, let
her keep it thrumming on all night! And, mousing back through the
fruit garden, he regained the verandah. Though he meant to go in
and speak to her now, he still hesitated, not knowing what to say,
trying hard to recall how it felt to be thwarted in love. He ought
to know, ought to remember&mdash;and he could not! Gone&mdash;all
real recollection; except that it had hurt him horribly. In this
blankness he stood passing his handkerchief over hands and lips,
which were very dry. By craning his head he could just see Fleur,
standing with her back to that piano still grinding out its tune,
her arms tight crossed on her breast, a lighted cigarette between
her lips, whose smoke half veiled her face. The expression on it
was strange to Soames, the eyes shone and stared, and every feature
was alive with a sort of wretched scorn and anger. Once or twice he
had seen Annette look like that&mdash;the face was too vivid, too
naked, not his daughter's at that moment. And he dared not go in,
realising the futility of any attempt at consolation. He sat down
in the shadow of the ingle-nook.</p>

<p>Monstrous trick, that Fate had played him! Nemesis! That old
unhappy marriage! And in God's name-why? How was he to know, when
he wanted Irene so violently, and she consented to be his, that she
would never love him? The tune died and was renewed, and died
again, and still Soames sat in the shadow, waiting for he knew not
what. The fag of Fleur's cigarette, flung through the window, fell
on the grass; he watched it glowing, burning itself out. The moon
had freed herself above the poplars, and poured her unreality on
the garden. Comfortless light, mysterious, withdrawn&mdash;like the
beauty of that woman who had never loved him&mdash;dappling the
nemesias and the stocks with a vesture not of earth. Flowers! And
his flower so unhappy! Ah! Why could one not put happiness into
Local Loans, gild its edges, insure it against going down?</p>

<p>Light had ceased to flow out now from the drawing-room window.
All was silent and dark in there. Had she gone up? He rose, and,
tiptoeing, peered in. It seemed so! He entered. The verandah kept
the moonlight out; and at first he could see nothing but the
outlines of furniture blacker than the darkness. He groped toward
the farther window to shut it. His foot struck a chair, and he
heard a gasp. There she was, curled and crushed into the corner of
the sofa! His hand hovered. Did she want his consolation? He stood,
gazing at that ball of crushed frills and hair and graceful youth,
trying to burrow its way out of sorrow. How leave her there? At
last he touched her hair, and said:</p>

<p>"Come, darling, better go to bed. I'll make it up to you,
somehow." How fatuous! But what could he have said?</p>

<hr>

<h3>IX.&mdash;UNDER THE OAK-TREE</h3>

<p>When their visitor had disappeared Jon and his mother stood
without speaking, till he said suddenly:</p>

<p>"I ought to have seen him out."</p>

<p>But Soames was already walking down the drive, and Jon went
upstairs to his father's studio, not trusting himself to go
back.</p>

<p>The expression on his mother's face confronting the man she had
once been married to, had sealed a resolution growing within him
ever since she left him the night before. It had put the finishing
touch of reality. To marry Fleur would be to hit his mother in the
face; to betray his dead father! It was no good! Jon had the least
resentful of natures. He bore his parents no grudge in this hour of
his distress. For one so young there was a rather strange power in
him of seeing things in some sort of proportion. It was worse for
Fleur, worse for his mother even, than it was for him. Harder than
to give up was to be given up, or to be the cause of some one you
loved giving up for you. He must not, would not behave grudgingly!
While he stood watching the tardy sunlight, he had again that
sudden vision of the world which had come to him the night before.
Sea on sea, country on country, millions on millions of people, all
with their own lives, energies, joys, griefs, and
suffering&mdash;all with things they had to give up, and separate
struggles for existence. Even though he might be willing to give up
all else for the one thing he couldn't have, he would be a fool to
think his feelings mattered much in so vast a world, and to behave
like a cry-baby or a cad. He pictured the people who had
nothing&mdash;the millions who had given up life in the War, the
millions whom the War had left with life and little else; the
hungry children he had read of, the shattered men; people in
prison, every kind of unfortunate. And&mdash;they did not help him
much. If one had to miss a meal, what comfort in the knowledge that
many others had to miss it too? There was more distraction in the
thought of getting away out into this vast world of which he knew
nothing yet. He could not go on staying here, walled in and
sheltered, with everything so slick and comfortable, and nothing to
do but brood and think what might have been. He could not go back
to Wansdon, and the memories of Fleur. If he saw her again he could
not trust himself; and if he stayed here or went back there, he
would surely see her. While they were within reach of each other
that must happen. To go far away and quickly was the only thing to
do. But, however much he loved his mother, he did not want to go
away with her. Then feeling that was brutal, he made up his mind
desperately to propose that they should go to Italy. For two hours
in that melancholy room he tried to master himself, then dressed
solemnly for dinner.</p>

<p>His mother had done the same. They ate little, at some length,
and talked of his father's catalogue. The show was arranged for
October, and beyond clerical detail there was nothing more to
do.</p>

<p>After dinner she put on a cloak and they went out; walked a
little, talked a little, till they were standing silent at last
beneath the oak-tree. Ruled by the thought: 'If I show anything, I
show all,' Jon put his arm through hers and said quite
casually:</p>

<p>"Mother, let's go to Italy."</p>

<p>Irene pressed his arm, and said as casually:</p>

<p>"It would be very nice; but I've been thinking you ought to see
and do more than you would if I were with you."</p>

<p>"But then you'd be alone."</p>

<p>"I was once alone for more than twelve years. Besides, I should
like to be here for the opening of Father's show."</p>

<p>Jon's grip tightened round her arm; he was not deceived.</p>

<p>"You couldn't stay here all by yourself; it's too big."</p>

<p>"Not here, perhaps. In London, and I might go to Paris, after
the show opens. You ought to have a year at least, Jon, and see the
world."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'd like to see the world and rough it. But I don't want
to leave you all alone."</p>

<p>"My dear, I owe you that at least. If it's for your good, it'll
be for mine. Why not start tomorrow? You've got your passport."</p>

<p>"Yes; if I'm going it had better be at once.
Only&mdash;Mother&mdash;if&mdash;if I wanted to stay out
somewhere&mdash;America or anywhere, would you mind coming
presently?"</p>

<p>"Wherever and whenever you send for me. But don't send until you
really want me."</p>

<p>Jon drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"I feel England's choky."</p>

<p>They stood a few minutes longer under the oak-tree&mdash;looking
out to where the grand stand at Epsom was veiled in evening. The
branches kept the moonlight from them, so that it only fell
everywhere else&mdash;over the fields and far away, and on the
windows of the creepered house behind, which soon would be to
let.</p>

<h3>X.&mdash;FLEUR'S WEDDING</h3>

<p>The October paragraphs describing the wedding of Fleur Forsyte
to Michael Mont hardly conveyed the symbolic significance of this
event. In the union of the great-granddaughter of "Superior Dosset"
with the heir of a ninth baronet was the outward and visible sign
of that merger of class in class which buttresses the political
stability of a realm. The time had come when the Forsytes might
resign their natural resentment against a "flummery" not theirs by
birth, and accept it as the still more natural due of their
possessive instincts. Besides, they had to mount to make room for
all those so much more newly rich. In that quiet but tasteful
ceremony in Hanover Square, and afterward among the furniture in
Green Street, it had been impossible for those not in the know to
distinguish the Forsyte troop from the Mont contingent&mdash;so far
away was "Superior Dosset" now. Was there, in the crease of his
trousers, the expression of his moustache, his accent, or the shine
on his top-hat, a pin to choose between Soames and the ninth
baronet himself? Was not Fleur as self-possessed, quick, glancing,
pretty, and hard as the likeliest Muskham, Mont, or Charwell filly
present? If anything, the Forsytes had it in dress and looks and
manners. They had become "upper class" and now their name would be
formally recorded in the Stud Book, their money joined to land.
Whether this was a little late in the day, and those rewards of the
possessive instinct, lands and money, destined for the
melting-pot&mdash;was still a question so moot that it was not
mooted. After all, Timothy had said Consols were goin' up. Timothy,
the last, the missing link; Timothy, in extremis on the Bayswater
Road&mdash;so Francie had reported. It was whispered, too, that
this young Mont was a sort of socialist&mdash;strangely wise of
him, and in the nature of insurance, considering the days they
lived in. There was no uneasiness on that score. The landed classes
produced that sort of amiable foolishness at times, turned to safe
uses and confined to theory. As George remarked to his sister
Francie: "They'll soon be having puppies&mdash;that'll give him
pause."</p>

<p>The church with white flowers and something blue in the middle
of the East window looked extremely chaste, as though endeavouring
to counteract the somewhat lurid phraseology of a Service
calculated to keep the thoughts of all on puppies. Forsytes,
Haymans, Tweetymans, sat in the left aisle; Monts, Charwells;
Muskhams in the right; while a sprinkling of Fleur's
fellow-sufferers at school, and of Mont's fellow-sufferers in, the
War, gaped indiscriminately from either side, and three maiden
ladies, who had dropped in on their way from Skyward's brought up
the rear, together with two Mont retainers and Fleur's old nurse.
In the unsettled state of the country as full a house as could be
expected.</p>

<p>Mrs. Val Dartie, who sat with her husband in the third row,
squeezed his hand more than once during the performance. To her,
who knew the plot of this tragi-comedy, its most dramatic moment
was well-nigh painful. 'I wonder if Jon knows by instinct,' she
thought&mdash;Jon, out in British Columbia. She had received a
letter from him only that morning which had made her smile and
say:</p>

<p>"Jon's in British Columbia, Val, because he wants to be in
California. He thinks it's too nice there."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Val, "so he's beginning to see a joke again."</p>

<p>"He's bought some land and sent for his mother."</p>

<p>"What on earth will she do out there?"</p>

<p>"All she cares about is Jon. Do you still think it a happy
release?"</p>

<p>Val's shrewd eyes narrowed to grey pin-points between their dark
lashes.</p>

<p>"Fleur wouldn't have suited him a bit. She's not bred
right."</p>

<p>"Poor little Fleur!" sighed Holly. Ah! it was strange&mdash;this
marriage. The young man, Mont, had caught her on the rebound, of
course, in the reckless mood of one whose ship has just gone down.
Such a plunge could not but be&mdash;as Val put it&mdash;an outside
chance. There was little to be told from the back view of her young
cousin's veil, and Holly's eyes reviewed the general aspect of this
Christian wedding. She, who had made a love-match which had been
successful, had a horror of unhappy marriages. This might not be
one in the end&mdash;but it was clearly a toss-up; and to
consecrate a toss-up in this fashion with manufactured unction
before a crowd of fashionable free-thinkers&mdash;for who thought
otherwise than freely, or not at all, when they were "dolled"
up&mdash;seemed to her as near a sin as one could find in an age
which had abolished them. Her eyes wandered from the prelate in his
robes (a Charwell-the Forsytes had not as yet produced a prelate)
to Val, beside her, thinking&mdash;she was certain&mdash;of the
Mayfly filly at fifteen to one for the Cambridgeshire. They passed
on and caught the profile of the ninth baronet, in counterfeitment
of the kneeling process. She could just see the neat ruck above his
knees where he had pulled his trousers up, and thought: 'Val's
forgotten to pull up his!' Her eyes passed to the pew in front of
her, where Winifred's substantial form was gowned with passion, and
on again to Soames and Annette kneeling side by side. A little
smile came on her lips&mdash;Prosper Profond, back from the South
Seas of the Channel, would be kneeling too, about six rows behind.
Yes! This was a funny "small" business, however it turned out;
still it was in a proper church and would be in the proper papers
to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>They had begun a hymn; she could hear the ninth baronet across
the aisle, singing of the hosts of Midian. Her little finger
touched Val's thumb&mdash;they were holding the same
hymn-book&mdash;and a tiny thrill passed through her,
preserved&mdash;from twenty years ago. He stooped and
whispered:</p>

<p>"I say, d'you remember the rat?" The rat at their wedding in
Cape Colony, which had cleaned its whiskers behind the table at the
Registrar's! And between her little and third forgers she squeezed
his thumb hard.</p>

<p>The hymn was over, the prelate had begun to deliver his
discourse. He told them of the dangerous times they lived in, and
the awful conduct of the House of Lords in connection with divorce.
They were all soldiers&mdash;he said&mdash;in the trenches under
the poisonous gas of the Prince of Darkness, and must be manful.
The purpose of marriage was children, not mere sinful
happiness.</p>

<p>An imp danced in Holly's eyes&mdash;Val's eyelashes were
meeting. Whatever happened; he must not snore. Her finger and thumb
closed on his thigh till he stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>The discourse was over, the danger past. They were signing in
the vestry; and general relaxation had set in.</p>

<p>A voice behind her said:</p>

<p>"Will she stay the course?"</p>

<p>"Who's that?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Old George Forsyte!"</p>

<p>Holly demurely scrutinized one of whom she had often heard.
Fresh from South Africa, and ignorant of her kith and kin, she
never saw one without an almost childish curiosity. He was very
big, and very dapper; his eyes gave her a funny feeling of having
no particular clothes.</p>

<p>"They're off!" she heard him say.</p>

<p>They came, stepping from the chancel. Holly looked first in
young Mont's face. His lips and ears were twitching, his eyes,
shifting from his feet to the hand within his arm, stared suddenly
before them as if to face a firing party. He gave Holly the feeling
that he was spiritually intoxicated. But Fleur! Ah! That was
different. The girl was perfectly composed, prettier than ever, in
her white robes and veil over her banged dark chestnut hair; her
eyelids hovered demure over her dark hazel eyes. Outwardly, she
seemed all there. But inwardly, where was she? As those two passed,
Fleur raised her eyelids&mdash;the restless glint of those clear
whites remained on Holly's vision as might the flutter of caged
bird's wings.</p>

<p>In Green Street Winifred stood to receive, just a little less
composed than usual. Soames' request for the use of her house had
come on her at a deeply psychological moment. Under the influence
of a remark of Prosper Profond, she had begun to exchange her
Empire for Expressionistic furniture. There were the most amusing
arrangements, with violet, green, and orange blobs and scriggles,
to be had at Mealard's. Another month and the change would have
been complete. Just now, the very "intriguing" recruits she had
enlisted, did not march too well with the old guard. It was as if
her regiment were half in khaki, half in scarlet and bearskins. But
her strong and comfortable character made the best of it in a
drawing-room which typified, perhaps, more perfectly than she
imagined, the semi-bolshevized imperialism of her country. After
all, this was a day of merger, and you couldn't have too much of
it! Her eyes travelled indulgently among her guests. Soames had
gripped the back of a buhl chair; young Mont was behind that
"awfully amusing" screen, which no one as yet had been able to
explain to her. The ninth baronet had shied violently at a round
scarlet table, inlaid under glass with blue Australian butteries'
wings, and was clinging to her Louis-Quinze cabinet; Francie
Forsyte had seized the new mantel-board, finely carved with little
purple grotesques on an ebony ground; George, over by the old
spinet, was holding a little sky-blue book as if about to enter
bets; Prosper Profond was twiddling the knob of the open door,
black with peacock-blue panels; and Annette's hands, close by, were
grasping her own waist; two Muskhams clung to the balcony among the
plants, as if feeling ill; Lady Mont, thin and brave-looking, had
taken up her long-handled glasses and was gazing at the central
light shade, of ivory and orange dashed with deep magenta, as if
the heavens had opened. Everybody, in fact, seemed holding on to
something. Only Fleur, still in her bridal dress, was detached from
all support, flinging her words and glances to left and right.</p>

<p>The room was full of the bubble and the squeak of conversation.
Nobody could hear anything that anybody said; which seemed of
little consequence, since no one waited for anything so slow as an
answer. Modern conversation seemed to Winifred so different from
the days of her prime, when a drawl was all the vogue. Still it was
"amusing," which, of course, was all that mattered. Even the
Forsytes were talking with extreme rapidity&mdash;Fleur and
Christopher, and Imogen, and young Nicholas's youngest, Patrick.
Soames, of course, was silent; but George, by the spinet, kept up a
running commentary, and Francie, by her mantel-shelf. Winifred drew
nearer to the ninth baronet. He seemed to promise a certain repose;
his nose was fine and drooped a little, his grey moustaches too;
and she said, drawling through her smile:</p>

<p>"It's rather nice, isn't it?"</p>

<p>His reply shot out of his smile like a snipped bread pellet</p>

<p>"D'you remember, in Frazer, the tribe that buries the bride up
to the waist?"</p>

<p>He spoke as fast as anybody! He had dark lively little eyes,
too, all crinkled round like a Catholic priest's. Winifred felt
suddenly he might say things she would regret.</p>

<p>"They're always so amusing&mdash;weddings," she murmured, and
moved on to Soames. He was curiously still, and Winifred saw at
once what was dictating his immobility. To his right was George
Forsyte, to his left Annette and Prosper Profond. He could not move
without either seeing those two together, or the reflection of them
in George Forsyte's japing eyes. He was quite right not to be
taking notice.</p>

<p>"They say Timothy's sinking;" he said glumly.</p>

<p>"Where will you put him, Soames?"</p>

<p>"Highgate." He counted on his fingers. "It'll make twelve of
them there, including wives. How do you think Fleur looks?"</p>

<p>"Remarkably well."</p>

<p>Soames nodded. He had never seen her look prettier, yet he could
not rid himself of the impression that this business was
unnatural&mdash;remembering still that crushed figure burrowing
into the corner of the sofa. From that night to this day he had
received from her no confidences. He knew from his chauffeur that
she had made one more attempt on Robin Hill and drawn
blank&mdash;an empty house, no one at home. He knew that she had
received a letter, but not what was in it, except that it had made
her hide herself and cry. He had remarked that she looked at him
sometimes when she thought he wasn't noticing, as if she were
wondering still what he had done&mdash;forsooth&mdash;to make those
people hate him so. Well, there it was! Annette had come back, and
things had worn on through the summer&mdash;very miserable, till
suddenly Fleur had said she was going to marry young Mont. She had
shown him a little more affection when she told him that. And he
had yielded&mdash;what was the good of opposing it? God knew that
he had never wished to thwart her in anything! And the young man
seemed quite delirious about her. No doubt she was in a reckless
mood, and she was young, absurdly young. But if he opposed her, he
didn't know what she would do; for all he could tell she might want
to take up a profession, become a doctor or solicitor, some
nonsense. She had no aptitude for painting, writing, music, in his
view the legitimate occupations of unmarried women, if they must do
something in these days. On the whole, she was safer married, for
he could see too well how feverish and restless she was at home.
Annette, too, had been in favour of it&mdash;Annette, from behind
the veil of his refusal to know what she was about, if she was
about anything. Annette had said: "Let her marry this young man. He
is a nice boy&mdash;not so highty-flighty as he seems." Where she
got her expressions, he didn't know&mdash;but her opinion soothed
his doubts. His wife, whatever her conduct, had clear eyes and an
almost depressing amount of common sense. He had settled fifty
thousand on Fleur, taking care that there was no cross settlement
in case it didn't turn out well. Could it turn out well? She had
not got over that other boy&mdash;he knew. They were to go to Spain
for the honeymoon. He would be even lonelier when she was gone. But
later, perhaps, she would forget, and turn to him again! Winifred's
voice broke on his reverie.</p>

<p>"Why! Of all wonders-June!"</p>

<p>There, in a djibbah&mdash;what things she wore!&mdash;with her
hair straying from under a fillet, Soames saw his cousin, and Fleur
going forward to greet her. The two passed from their view out on
to the stairway.</p>

<p>"Really," said Winifred, "she does the most impossible things!
Fancy her coming!"</p>

<p>"What made you ask her?" muttered Soames.</p>

<p>"Because I thought she wouldn't accept, of course."</p>

<p>Winifred had forgotten that behind conduct lies the main trend
of character; or, in other words, omitted to remember that Fleur
was now a "lame duck."</p>

<p>On receiving her invitation, June had first thought, 'I wouldn't
go near them for the world!' and then, one morning, had awakened
from a dream of Fleur waving to her from a boat with a wild unhappy
gesture. And she had changed her mind.</p>

<p>When Fleur came forward and said to her, "Do come up while I'm
changing my dress," she had followed up the stairs. The girl led
the way into Imogen's old bedroom, set ready for her toilet.</p>

<p>June sat down on the bed, thin and upright, like a little spirit
in the sear and yellow. Fleur locked the door.</p>

<p>The girl stood before her divested of her wedding dress. What a
pretty thing she was!</p>

<p>"I suppose you think me a fool," she said, with quivering lips,
"when it was to have been Jon. But what does it matter? Michael
wants me, and I don't care. It'll get me away from home." Diving
her hand into the frills on her breast, she brought out a letter.
"Jon wrote me this."</p>

<p>June read: "Lake Okanagen, British Columbia. I'm not coming back
to England. Bless you always. Jon."</p>

<p>"She's made safe, you see," said Fleur.</p>

<p>June handed back the letter.</p>

<p>"That's not fair to Irene," she said, "she always told Jon he
could do as he wished."</p>

<p>Fleur smiled bitterly. "Tell me, didn't she spoil your life
too?" June looked up. "Nobody can spoil a life, my dear. That's
nonsense. Things happen, but we bob up."</p>

<p>With a sort of terror she saw the girl sink on her knees and
bury her face in the djibbah. A strangled sob mounted to June's
ears.</p>

<p>"It's all right&mdash;all right," she murmured, "Don't! There,
there!"</p>

<p>But the point of the girl's chin was pressed ever closer into
her thigh, and the sound was dreadful of her sobbing.</p>

<p>Well, well! It had to come. She would feel better afterward!
June stroked the short hair of that shapely head; and all the
scattered mother-sense in her focussed itself and passed through
the tips of her fingers into the girl's brain.</p>

<p>"Don't sit down under it, my dear," she said at last. "We can't
control life, but we can fight it. Make the best of things. I've
had to. I held on, like you; and I cried, as you're crying now. And
look at me!"</p>

<p>Fleur raised her head; a sob merged suddenly into a little
choked laugh. In truth it was a thin and rather wild and wasted
spirit she was looking at, but it had brave eyes.</p>

<p>"All right!" she said. "I'm sorry. I shall forget him, I
suppose, if I fly fast and far enough."</p>

<p>And, scrambling to her feet, she went over to the
wash-stand.</p>

<p>June watched her removing with cold water the traces of emotion.
Save for a little becoming pinkness there was nothing left when she
stood before the mirror. June got off the bed and took a
pin-cushion in her hand. To put two pins into the wrong places was
all the vent she found for sympathy.</p>

<p>"Give me a kiss," she said when Fleur was ready, and dug her
chin into the girl's warm cheek.</p>

<p>"I want a whiff," said Fleur; "don't wait."</p>

<p>June left her, sitting on the bed with a cigarette between her
lips and her eyes half closed, and went down-stairs. In the doorway
of the drawing-room stood Soames as if unquiet at his daughter's
tardiness. June tossed her head and passed down on to the
half-landing. Her cousin Francie was standing there.</p>

<p>"Look!" said June, pointing with her chin at Soames. "That man's
fatal!"</p>

<p>"How do you mean," said Francie, "fatal?"</p>

<p>June did not answer her. "I shan't wait to see them off," she
said. "Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" said Francie, and her eyes, of a Celtic grey,
goggled. That old feud! Really, it was quite romantic!</p>

<p>Soames, moving to the well of the staircase, saw June go, and
drew a breath of satisfaction. Why didn't Fleur come? They would
miss their train. That train would bear her away from him, yet he
could not help fidgeting at the thought that they would lose it.
And then she did come, running down in her tan-coloured frock and
black velvet cap, and passed him into the drawing-room. He saw her
kiss her mother, her aunt, Val's wife, Imogen, and then come forth,
quick and pretty as ever. How would she treat him at this last
moment of her girlhood? He couldn't hope for much!</p>

<p>Her lips pressed the middle of his cheek.</p>

<p>"Daddy!" she said, and was past and gone! Daddy! She hadn't
called him that for years. He drew a long breath and followed
slowly down. There was all the folly with that confetti stuff and
the rest of it to go through with yet. But he would like just to
catch her smile, if she leaned out, though they would hit her in
the eye with the shoe, if they didn't take care. Young Mont's voice
said fervently in his ear:</p>

<p>"Good-bye, sir; and thank you! I'm so fearfully bucked."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said; "don't miss your train."</p>

<p>He stood on the bottom step but three, whence he could see above
the heads&mdash;the silly hats and heads. They were in the car now;
and there was that stuff, showering, and there went the shoe. A
flood of something welled up in Soames, and&mdash;he didn't
know&mdash;he couldn't see!</p>

<h3>XI.&mdash;THE LAST OF THE OLD FORSYTES</h3>

<p>When they came to prepare that terrific symbol Timothy
Forsyte&mdash;the one pure individualist left, the only man who
hadn't heard of the Great War&mdash;they found him
wonderful&mdash;not even death had undermined his soundness.</p>

<p>To Smither and Cook that preparation came like final evidence of
what they had never believed possible&mdash;the end of the old
Forsyte family on earth. Poor Mr. Timothy must now take a harp and
sing in the company of Miss Forsyte, Mrs. Julia, Miss Hester; with
Mr. Jolyon, Mr. Swithin, Mr. James, Mr. Roger, and Mr. Nicholas of
the party. Whether Mrs. Hayman would be there was more doubtful,
seeing that she had been cremated. Secretly Cook thought that Mr.
Timothy would be upset&mdash;he had always been so set against
barrel organs. How many times had she not said: "Drat the thing!
There it is again! Smither, you'd better run up and see what you
can do." And in her heart she would so have enjoyed the tunes, if
she hadn't known that Mr. Timothy would ring the bell in a minute
and say: "Here, take him a halfpenny and tell him to move on."
Often they had been obliged to add threepence of their own before
the man would go&mdash;Timothy had ever underrated the value of
emotion. Luckily he had taken the organs for blue-bottles in his
last years, which had been a comfort, and they had been able to
enjoy the tunes. But a harp! Cook wondered. It was a change! And
Mr. Timothy had never liked change. But she did not speak of this
to Smither, who did so take a line of her own in regard to heaven
that it quite put one about sometimes.</p>

<p>She cried while Timothy was being prepared, and they all had
sherry afterward out of the yearly Christmas bottle, which would
not be needed now. Ah! dear! She had been there five-and-forty
years and Smither three-and-forty! And now they would be going to a
tiny house in Tooting, to live on their savings and what Miss
Hester had so kindly left them&mdash;for to take fresh service
after the glorious past&mdash;No! But they would like just to see
Mr. Soames again, and Mrs. Dartie, and Miss Francie, and Miss
Euphemia. And even if they had to take their own cab, they felt
they must go to the funeral. For six years Mr. Timothy had been
their baby, getting younger and younger every day, till at last he
had been too young to live.</p>

<p>They spent the regulation hours of waiting in polishing and
dusting, in catching the one mouse left, and asphyxiating the last
beetle so as to leave it nice, discussing with each other what they
would buy at the sale. Miss Ann's workbox; Miss Juley's (that is
Mrs. Julia's) seaweed album; the fire-screen Miss Hester had
crewelled; and Mr. Timothy's hair&mdash;little golden curls, glued
into a black frame. Oh! they must have those&mdash;only the price
of things had gone up so!</p>

<p>It fell to Soames to issue invitations for the funeral. He had
them drawn up by Gradman in his office&mdash;only blood relations,
and no flowers. Six carriages were ordered. The Will would be read
afterward at the house.</p>

<p>He arrived at eleven o'clock to see that all was ready. At a
quarter past old Gradman came in black gloves and crape on his hat.
He and Soames stood in the drawing-room waiting. At half-past
eleven the carriages drew up in a long row. But no one else
appeared. Gradman said:</p>

<p>"It surprises me, Mr. Soames. I posted them myself."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Soames; "he'd lost touch with the family."
Soames had often noticed in old days how much more neighbourly his
family were to the dead than to the living. But, now, the way they
had flocked to Fleur's wedding and abstained from Timothy's
funeral, seemed to show some vital change. There might, of course,
be another reason; for Soames felt that if he had not known the
contents of Timothy's Will, he might have stayed away himself
through delicacy. Timothy had left a lot of money, with nobody in
particular to leave it to. They mightn't like to seem to expect
something.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock the procession left the door; Timothy alone in
the first carriage under glass. Then Soames alone; then Gradman
alone; then Cook and Smither together. They started at a walk, but
were soon trotting under a bright sky. At the entrance to Highgate
Cemetery they were delayed by service in the Chapel. Soames would
have liked to stay outside in the sunshine. He didn't believe a
word of it; on the other hand, it was a form of insurance which
could not safely be neglected, in case there might be something in
it after all.</p>

<p>They walked up two and two&mdash;he and Gradman, Cook and
Smither&mdash;to the family vault. It was not very distinguished
for the funeral of the last old Forsyte.</p>

<p>He took Gradman into his carriage on the way back to the
Bayswater Road with a certain glow in his heart. He had a surprise
in pickle for the old chap who had served the Forsytes
four-and-fifty years-a treat that was entirely his doing. How well
he remembered saying to Timothy the day&mdash;after Aunt Hester's
funeral: "Well; Uncle Timothy, there's Gradman. He's taken a lot of
trouble for the family. What do you say to leaving him five
thousand?" and his surprise, seeing the difficulty there had been
in getting Timothy to leave anything, when Timothy had nodded. And
now the old chap would be as pleased as Punch, for Mrs. Gradman, he
knew, had a weak heart, and their son had lost a leg in the War. It
was extraordinarily gratifying to Soames to have left him five
thousand pounds of Timothy's money. They sat down together in the
little drawing-room, whose walls&mdash;like a vision of
heaven&mdash;were sky-blue and gold with every picture-frame
unnaturally bright, and every speck of dust removed from every
piece of furniture, to read that little masterpiece&mdash;the Will
of Timothy. With his back to the light in Aunt Hester's chair,
Soames faced Gradman with his face to the light, on Aunt Ann's
sofa; and, crossing his legs, began:</p>

<p>"This is the last Will and Testament of me Timothy Forsyte of
The Bower Bayswater Road, London I appoint my nephew Soames Forsyte
of The Shelter Mapleduram and Thomas Gradman of 159 Folly Road
Highgate (hereinafter called my Trustees) to be the trustees and
executors of this my Will To the said Soames Forsyte I leave the
sum of one thousand pounds free of legacy duty and to the said
Thomas Gradman I leave the sum of five thousand pounds free of
legacy duty."</p>

<p>Soames paused. Old Gradman was leaning forward, convulsively
gripping a stout black knee with each of his thick hands; his mouth
had fallen open so that the gold fillings of three teeth gleamed;
his eyes were blinking, two tears rolled slowly out of them. Soames
read hastily on.</p>

<p>"All the rest of my property of whatsoever description I
bequeath to my Trustees upon Trust to convert and hold the same
upon the following trusts namely To pay thereout all my debts
funeral expenses and outgoings of any kind in connection with my
Will and to hold the residue thereof in trust for that male lineal
descendant of my father Jolyon Forsyte by his marriage with Ann
Pierce who after the decease of all lineal descendants whether male
or female of my said father by his said marriage in being at the
time of my death shall last attain the age of twenty-one years
absolutely it being my desire that my property shall be nursed to
the extreme limit permitted by the laws of England for the benefit
of such male lineal descendant as aforesaid."</p>

<p>Soames read the investment and attestation clauses, and,
ceasing, looked at Gradman. The old fellow was wiping his brow with
a large handkerchief, whose brilliant colour supplied a sudden
festive tinge to the proceedings.</p>

<p>"My word, Mr. Soames!" he said, and it was clear that the lawyer
in him had utterly wiped out the man: "My word! Why, there are two
babies now, and some quite young children&mdash;if one of them
lives to be eighty&mdash;it's not a great age&mdash;and add
twenty-one&mdash;that's a hundred years; and Mr. Timothy worth a
hundred and fifty thousand pound net if he's worth a penny.
Compound interest at five per cent. doubles you in fourteen years.
In fourteen years three hundred thousand-six hundred thousand in
twenty-eight&mdash;twelve hundred thousand in
forty-two&mdash;twenty-four hundred thousand in
fifty-six&mdash;four million eight hundred thousand in
seventy&mdash;nine million six hundred thousand in
eighty-four&mdash;Why, in a hundred years it'll be twenty million!
And we shan't live to use it! It is a Will!"</p>

<p>Soames said dryly: "Anything may happen. The State might take
the lot; they're capable of anything in these days."</p>

<p>"And carry five," said Gradman to himself. "I forgot&mdash;Mr.
Timothy's in Consols; we shan't get more than two per cent. with
this income tax. To be on the safe side, say eight millions. Still,
that's a pretty penny."</p>

<p>Soames rose and handed him the Will. "You're going into the
City. Take care of that, and do what's necessary. Advertise; but
there are no debts. When's the sale?"</p>

<p>"Tuesday week," said Gradman. "Life or lives in bein' and
twenty-one years afterward&mdash;it's a long way off. But I'm glad
he's left it in the family..."</p>

<p>The sale&mdash;not at Jobson's, in view of the Victorian nature
of the effects&mdash;was far more freely attended than the funeral,
though not by Cook and Smither, for Soames had taken it on himself
to give them their heart's desires. Winifred was present, Euphemia,
and Francie, and Eustace had come in his car. The miniatures,
Barbizons, and J. R. drawings had been bought in by Soames; and
relics of no marketable value were set aside in an off-room for
members of the family who cared to have mementoes. These were the
only restrictions upon bidding characterised by an almost tragic
languor. Not one piece of furniture, no picture or porcelain figure
appealed to modern taste. The humming birds had fallen like autumn
leaves when taken from where they had not hummed for sixty years.
It was painful to Soames to see the chairs his aunts had sat on,
the little grand piano they had practically never played, the books
whose outsides they had gazed at, the china they had dusted, the
curtains they had drawn, the hearth-rug which had warmed their
feet; above all, the beds they had lain and died in&mdash;sold to
little dealers, and the housewives of Fulham. And yet&mdash;what
could one do? Buy them and stick them in a lumber-room? No; they
had to go the way of all flesh and furniture, and be worn out. But
when they put up Aunt Ann's sofa and were going to knock it down
for thirty shillings, he cried out, suddenly: "Five pounds!" The
sensation was considerable, and the sofa his.</p>

<p>When that little sale was over in the fusty saleroom, and those
Victorian ashes scattered, he went out into the misty October
sunshine feeling as if cosiness had died out of the world, and the
board "To Let" was up, indeed. Revolutions on the horizon; Fleur in
Spain; no comfort in Annette; no Timothy's on the Bayswater Road.
In the irritable desolation of his soul he went into the Goupenor
Gallery. That chap Jolyon's watercolours were on view there. He
went in to look down his nose at them&mdash;it might give him some
faint satisfaction. The news had trickled through from June to
Val's wife, from her to Val, from Val to his mother, from her to
Soames, that the house&mdash;the fatal house at Robin
Hill&mdash;was for sale, and Irene going to join her boy out in
British Columbia, or some such place. For one wild moment the
thought had come to Soames: 'Why shouldn't I buy it back? I meant
it for my&mdash;!' No sooner come than gone. Too lugubrious a
triumph; with too many humiliating memories for himself and Fleur.
She would never live there after what had happened. No, the place
must go its way to some peer or profiteer. It had been a bone of
contention from the first, the shell of the feud; and with the
woman gone, it was an empty shell. "For Sale or To Let." With his
mind's eye he could see that board raised high above the ivied wall
which he had built.</p>

<p>He passed through the first of the two rooms in the Gallery.
There was certainly a body of work! And now that the fellow was
dead it did not seem so trivial. The drawings were pleasing enough,
with quite a sense of atmosphere, and something individual in the
brush work. 'His father and my father; he and I; his child and
mine!' thought Soames. So it had gone on! And all about that woman!
Softened by the events of the past week, affected by the melancholy
beauty of the autumn day, Soames came nearer than he had ever been
to realisation of that truth&mdash;passing the understanding of a
Forsyte pure&mdash;that the body of Beauty has a spiritual essence,
uncapturable save by a devotion which thinks not of self. After
all, he was near that truth in his devotion to his daughter;
perhaps that made him understand a little how he had missed the
prize. And there, among the drawings of his kinsman, who had
attained to that which he had found beyond his reach, he thought of
him and her with a tolerance which surprised him. But he did not
buy a drawing.</p>

<p>Just as he passed the seat of custom on his return to the outer
air he met with a contingency which had not been entirely absent
from his mind when he went into the Gallery&mdash;Irene, herself,
coming in. So she had not gone yet, and was still paying farewell
visits to that fellow's remains! He subdued the little involuntary
leap of his subconsciousness, the mechanical reaction of his senses
to the charm of this once-owned woman, and passed her with averted
eyes. But when he had gone by he could not for the life of him help
looking back. This, then, was finality&mdash;the heat and stress of
his life, the madness and the longing thereof, the only defeat he
had known, would be over when she faded from his view this time;
even such memories had their own queer aching value.</p>

<p>She, too, was looking back. Suddenly she lifted her gloved hand,
her lips smiled faintly, her dark eyes seemed to speak. It was the
turn of Soames to make no answer to that smile and that little
farewell wave; he went out into the fashionable street quivering
from head to foot. He knew what she had meant to say: "Now that I
am going for ever out of the reach of you and yours&mdash;forgive
me; I wish you well." That was the meaning; last sign of that
terrible reality&mdash;passing morality, duty, common
sense&mdash;her aversion from him who had owned her body, but had
never touched her spirit or her heart. It hurt; yes&mdash;more than
if she had kept her mask unmoved, her hand unlifted.</p>

<p>Three days later, in that fast-yellowing October, Soames took a
taxi-cab to Highgate Cemetery and mounted through its white forest
to the Forsyte vault. Close to the cedar, above catacombs and
columbaria, tall, ugly, and individual, it looked like an apex of
the competitive system. He could remember a discussion wherein
Swithin had advocated the addition to its face of the pheasant
proper. The proposal had been rejected in favour of a wreath in
stone, above the stark words: "The family vault of Jolyon Forsyte:
1850." It was in good order. All trace of the recent interment had
been removed, and its sober grey gloomed reposefully in the
sunshine. The whole family lay there now, except old Jolyon's wife,
who had gone back under a contract to her own family vault in
Suffolk; old Jolyon himself lying at Robin Hill; and Susan Hayman,
cremated so that none knew where she might be. Soames gazed at it
with satisfaction&mdash;massive, needing little attention; and this
was important, for he was well aware that no one would attend to it
when he himself was gone, and he would have to be looking out for
lodgings soon. He might have twenty years before him, but one never
knew. Twenty years without an aunt or uncle, with a wife of whom
one had better not know anything, with a daughter gone from home.
His mood inclined to melancholy and retrospection.</p>

<p>This cemetery was full, they said&mdash;of people with
extraordinary names, buried in extraordinary taste. Still, they had
a fine view up here, right over London. Annette had once given him
a story to read by that Frenchman, Maupassant, most lugubrious
concern, where all the skeletons emerged from their graves one
night, and all the pious inscriptions on the stones were altered to
descriptions of their sins. Not a true story at all. He didn't know
about the French, but there was not much real harm in English
people except their teeth and their taste, which was certainly
deplorable. "The family vault of Jolyon Forsyte: 1850." A lot of
people had been buried here since then&mdash;a lot of English life
crumbled to mould and dust! The boom of an airplane passing under
the gold-tinted clouds caused him to lift his eyes. The deuce of a
lot of expansion had gone on. But it all came back to a
cemetery&mdash;to a name and a date on a tomb. And he thought with
a curious pride that he and his family had done little or nothing
to help this feverish expansion. Good solid middlemen, they had
gone to work with dignity to manage and possess. "Superior Dosset,"
indeed, had built in a dreadful, and Jolyon painted in a doubtful,
period, but so far as he remembered not another of them all had
soiled his hands by creating anything&mdash;unless you counted Val
Dartie and his horse-breeding. Collectors, solicitors, barristers,
merchants, publishers, accountants, directors, land agents, even
soldiers&mdash;there they had been! The country had expanded, as it
were, in spite of them. They had checked, controlled, defended, and
taken advantage of the process and when you considered how
"Superior Dosset" had begun life with next to nothing, and his
lineal descendants already owned what old Gradman estimated at
between a million and a million and a half, it was not so bad! And
yet he sometimes felt as if the family bolt was shot, their
possessive instinct dying out. They seemed unable to make
money&mdash;this fourth generation; they were going into art,
literature, farming, or the army; or just living on what was left
them&mdash;they had no push and no tenacity. They would die out if
they didn't take care.</p>

<p>Soames turned from the vault and faced toward the breeze. The
air up here would be delicious if only he could rid his nerves of
the feeling that mortality was in it. He gazed restlessly at the
crosses and the urns, the angels, the "immortelles," the flowers,
gaudy or withering; and suddenly he noticed a spot which seemed so
different from anything else up there that he was obliged to walk
the few necessary yards and look at it. A sober corner, with a
massive queer-shaped cross of grey rough-hewn granite, guarded by
four dark yew-trees. The spot was free from the pressure of the
other graves, having a little box-hedged garden on the far side,
and in front a goldening birch-tree. This oasis in the desert of
conventional graves appealed to the aesthetic sense of Soames, and
he sat down there in the sunshine. Through those trembling gold
birch leaves he gazed out at London, and yielded to the waves of
memory. He thought of Irene in Montpellier Square, when her hair
was rusty-golden and her white shoulders his&mdash;Irene, the prize
of his love-passion, resistant to his ownership. He saw Bosinney's
body lying in that white mortuary, and Irene sitting on the sofa
looking at space with the eyes of a dying bird. Again he thought of
her by the little green Niobe in the Bois de Boulogne, once more
rejecting him. His fancy took him on beside his drifting river on
the November day when Fleur was to be born, took him to the dead
leaves floating on the green-tinged water and the snake-headed weed
for ever swaying and nosing, sinuous, blind, tethered. And on again
to the window opened to the cold starry night above Hyde Park, with
his father lying dead. His fancy darted to that picture of "the
future town," to that boy's and Fleur's first meeting; to the
bluish trail of Prosper Profond's cigar, and Fleur in the window
pointing down to where the fellow prowled. To the sight of Irene
and that dead fellow sitting side by side in the stand at Lord's.
To her and that boy at Robin Hill. To the sofa, where Fleur lay
crushed up in the corner; to her lips pressed into his cheek, and
her farewell "Daddy." And suddenly he saw again Irene's grey-gloved
hand waving its last gesture of release.</p>

<p>He sat there a long time dreaming his career, faithful to the
scut of his possessive instinct, warming himself even with its
failures.</p>

<p>"To Let"&mdash;the Forsyte age and way of life, when a man owned
his soul, his investments, and his woman, without check or
question. And now the State had, or would have, his investments,
his woman had herself, and God knew who had his soul. "To
Let"&mdash;that sane and simple creed!</p>

<p>The waters of change were foaming in, carrying the promise of
new forms only when their destructive flood should have passed its
full. He sat there, subconscious of them, but with his thoughts
resolutely set on the past&mdash;as a man might ride into a wild
night with his face to the tail of his galloping horse. Athwart the
Victorian dykes the waters were rolling on property, manners, and
morals, on melody and the old forms of art&mdash;waters bringing to
his mouth a salt taste as of blood, lapping to the foot of this
Highgate Hill where Victorianism lay buried. And sitting there,
high up on its most individual spot, Soames&mdash;like a figure of
Investment&mdash;refused their restless sounds. Instinctively he
would not fight them&mdash;there was in him too much primeval
wisdom, of Man the possessive animal. They would quiet down when
they had fulfilled their tidal fever of dispossessing and
destroying; when the creations and the properties of others were
sufficiently broken and defected&mdash;they would lapse and ebb,
and fresh forms would rise based on an instinct older than the
fever of change&mdash;the instinct of Home.</p>

<p>"Je m'en fiche," said Prosper Profond. Soames did not say "Je
m'en fiche"&mdash;it was French, and the fellow was a thorn in his
side&mdash;but deep down he knew that change was only the interval
of death between two forms of life, destruction necessary to make
room for fresher property. What though the board was up, and
cosiness to let?&mdash;some one would come along and take it again
some day.</p>

<p>And only one thing really troubled him, sitting there&mdash;the
melancholy craving in his heart&mdash;because the sun was like
enchantment on his face and on the clouds and on the golden birch
leaves, and the wind's rustle was so gentle, and the yewtree green
so dark, and the sickle of a moon pale in the sky.</p>

<p>He might wish and wish and never get it&mdash;the beauty and the
loving in the world!</p>
