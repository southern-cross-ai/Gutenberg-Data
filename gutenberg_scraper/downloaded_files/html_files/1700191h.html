  <h2><a name="ch-01"
     id="ch-01"></a>I. &mdash; REUNION</h2>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">ANN SHERBORNE gazed at the ringed date in her pocket-diary.
  It was the fourteenth of November, 1941.</p>

  <p>"After all these years," she thought, "it has come at last. I can't
  believe it. It's <i>to-night</i>..."</p>

  <p>Seven years ago, on a wild November evening, high up in a turret-room
  which seemed to sway in the wind, this reunion had been arranged.
  Richard&mdash;their host&mdash;handed to each guest a card of typed
  instructions, reflecting his peculiar humour which specialised in
  insult.</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">Reunion of THE SULLIED SOULS at Ganges, November the
  fourteenth, 1941. According to custom, the tower-door will be left
  open&mdash;trustfully and without prejudice to character&mdash;from eight to
  twelve. Bring this card for purpose of identification. In seven years we
  shall all be changed and inevitably for the worst. Do not fail to keep this
  appointment, dead or alive, but preferably if dead. You will be livelier
  company."</p><br>

  <p>At the time of their last meeting, Ann only anticipated a temporary
  separation from her companions. Within forty-eight hours, however, she was on
  her way to Burma, with her parents. Her father was a brilliant
  engineer&mdash;as well as an intermittent drunkard&mdash;so that his wife had
  to work overtime to keep him anywhere near dry-level.</p>

  <p>The quiet little woman was responsible&mdash;indirectly&mdash;for some
  fine constructional work. When she died, she kept the contract in the family
  by passing on her job to Ann.</p>

  <p>During the weeks and months spent in exile, Ann never forgot the reunion.
  At the beginning of each fresh year, she drew a circle round the date in her
  pocket-diary. She used to stare at the enchanted numeral in a passion of
  longing. Richard's card of admission grew grimed and limp from being read in
  many a different scene and climate&mdash;high up in boulder-blocked mountains
  and besides sliding brown tropical rivers; above the snow-line and in the
  glare of the desert.</p>

  <p>As the years passed, her first doubts began to sharpen into fear. War
  broke out and her father decided not to return to England. When he signed a
  contract with a water corporation in Florida, she gave up hope of keeping her
  appointment in the flesh.</p>

  <p>"There's only one way," she told herself. "Get a monkey's paw, mail it to
  Richard and pass out. He'll attend to the rest."</p>

  <p>Near the end of October, 1941, her father died suddenly. At the time it
  seemed too late for her to return as all the odds were against her...But on
  the evening of the fourteenth, she was in a hotel in the heart of London,
  waiting for the minutes to pass before she set out for the place of
  reunion.</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">She sat at a small table in the crowded lounge, wedged in
  her place by a pack of occupied seats, while a continuous procession of
  people streamed past in search of a vacancy. Beside her was an elderly man
  who had come down from Lancashire on business. A keen judge of values, he had
  noticed her at breakfast and was struck by the force of character evident in
  her steadfast eyes and resolute lips.</p>

  <p>He was engaged in reading through his list of future engagements and he
  snapped the band around his book at the same moment as Ann closed her diary.
  Their eyes met and they smiled at the duplicated action. He had noticed
  previously that to her, a stranger was just another human-being and not a
  possible plague-contact, so he risked speaking to her.</p>

  <p>"We both seem to be checking-up on our dates. Are you in business?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated because the reunion was her secret; but since the shadow of
  the tremendous event was beginning to sag over her, she looked at his shrewd
  kindly face and was tempted to talk.</p>

  <p>"My date isn't business. I'm meeting people I've not seen for ages."</p>

  <p>"Friends?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No...It's queer, but really I know nothing about their private lives. I
  can't think how we ever got together. We were students at a college in London
  and we attended the same biology lectures."</p>

  <p>"Did you form a club?"</p>

  <p>His interest was so kindly that it redeemed his questions from curiosity
  and Ann was encouraged to expand.</p>

  <p>"It was more like a cult. Richard wanted devil-worship but no one would
  back him up. So we used to meet secretly and discuss world affairs. Richard
  was always planning purges and he kept a list of victims. He called us 'THE
  SEVEN SULLIED SOULS.'"</p>

  <p>"And were you sullied?" asked the Manchester man, smiling at the pompous
  title.</p>

  <p>"I can only speak for myself," Ann told him. "I was sixteen and very pure.
  But I kept quiet about my age and all that. As a matter of fact, I can't
  believe that anything could happen to either James or Victoria. James was one
  of those vague people you forget and Victoria was wrapped up in her work. But
  John and Isabella were so glamorous that I don't think they could stop
  affairs...And I could believe anything of Richard."</p>

  <p>Even in the heat of the lounge, she shivered at the recollection of his
  face&mdash;intermittently revealed in the leaping firelight&mdash;as they sat
  in the darkened tower-room. Deep lines gashed it from his
  extravagantly-arched nostrils to his mouth. She remembered too the
  corpse-like pallor of his skin, the shining black hair and the sinister
  upward slant of his brows.</p>

  <p>"We were all of us rather afraid of Richard," she confessed. "He was older
  than the rest of us and not a regular student. He was just rubbing up biology
  and he used to sneer at the lecturer. He thought it funny to say hurtful
  things."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you kick him out?"</p>

  <p>"Because, in a way, he helped to make the thrill. He seemed a sort of
  distorted genius. Besides, to be honest, we wanted to meet at his house. He
  lived with a wealthy uncle and there were always refreshments and
  drinks."</p>

  <p>The marble pillars and gilded walls of the hotel lounge faded out as Ann
  thought of the last session in the tower-room. She remembered the roaring
  wind and the trails of ivy which tapped on the window-panes.</p>

  <p>"We'll hold a reunion here, seven years from to-night," declared Richard.
  "By then, my old uncle should be hanged and I shall be lord of the manor.
  Possibly one of you may be successful, and damned, but I promise the rest of
  you jobs. Something in the Hercules tradition."</p>

  <p>"I bar elephant-stables," said one of them. "Otherwise, count me in.
  Already I feel a man with a future."</p>

  <p>Of course it was Stephen who spoke&mdash;Stephen who was merely amused by
  Richard and whose laughter could extract the sting from the most envenomed
  remark.</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">As Ann lapsed into silence, the Manchester man's interest
  deepened into a vague sense of responsibility. The hotel was large, central,
  and gave excellent value. It was termed "cheap and popular," so it attracted
  a mixed collection of guests, among whom were some cheap and popular
  gentlemen. The Manchester man had noticed that while some of these had tried
  to get acquainted with Ann, she seemed unaware of them, as though she were
  preoccupied with an exclusive interest.</p>

  <p>"Have you kept in touch with any of 'THE SULLIED SOULS'?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied. "I've been abroad and lost touch. My father died at the
  end of October."</p>

  <p>"How very sad," he said, shocked by so recent a loss.</p>

  <p>"Not for him." Her voice was level. "It was one of those illnesses you're
  thankful to be out of...At the time, it seemed impossible to keep my date.
  Every one told me so. But I went on trying and haunting agencies and bribing
  people. And then, almost at the last moment, I got a cancellation in an
  air-liner. A palmist had told the man there would be a terrible
  accident."</p>

  <p>"So you're not superstitious?"</p>

  <p>"But I <i>am</i>. I was expecting the crash, all the way, but I just hoped
  I might be lucky."</p>

  <p>"Used to flying, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No, it was my first trip. It was awful. Whenever we dropped, I left my
  stomach behind me, up in the air...But it was worth it for it was quick. I
  made London with time in hand."</p>

  <p>Again the Manchester man wondered what object had exacted such furious
  drive and fixity of purpose. Then he calculated the girl's age as
  twenty-three while he counted the number of the "Sullied Souls."</p>

  <p>"You've mentioned five names," he said casually. "You make six. Wasn't
  there a seventh member of your club?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Stephen."</p>

  <p>The radiance of her face told the Manchester man why she had flown to
  England.</p>

  <p>"Stephen was wonderful," she declared. "He had everything. And he gave out
  all he had."</p>

  <p>Then she looked at her watch, pressed out her cigarette and began to
  collect her belongings.</p>

  <p>"Nearly time to dress," she said in a different voice. "I've been boring
  you but you asked for it. I thought talking about it would help me to realise
  it, but I can't. I <i>can't</i> believe that in a short time we shall all be
  together again, after seven years."</p>

  <p>"Don't go," urged the Manchester man. "Wait for the postscript."</p>

  <p>His kindly face had grown grave as he fumbled for words.</p>

  <p>"Suppose&mdash;Are you sure the others will remember the date?"</p>

  <p>"Of course." Her voice was confident. "They couldn't forget."</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear, I'm John Blunt. And I'm a grandfather. Will you take some
  advice from an old-stager? Just ring up this Richard and make sure that it is
  a date. Remember, you're not used to the black-out."</p>

  <p>Ann's face was thoughtful as she considered the advice.</p>

  <p>"I can't ring up," she said. "It's unlikely that Richard would answer the
  phone and I can't leave a message. No one must know of our meetings. Secrecy
  was one of our vows."</p>

  <p>"Hum. What's the address?"</p>

  <p>"Ganges, Yellow-forge, Surrey. The house is right out in the country, at
  the end of the Tube. A local bus passes the gates."</p>

  <p>While the Manchester man was jotting down the details, he asked another
  question.</p>

  <p>"What time do you expect to be back?"</p>

  <p>"Not much later than one-thirty. We used to catch the last train."</p>

  <p>"Well, I warn you, if you don't show up, I shall make inquiries about you.
  I don't like to see a young girl running risks."</p>

  <p>"What risk?"</p>

  <p>"The risk of a big disappointment, to begin with. You've not seen these
  folks for years. They're bound to be changed and you may be
  disillusioned."</p>

  <p>"I know...But it's my chance. I've got to get in touch with someone again.
  This is the only way."</p>

  <p>Pushing back her chair, Ann rose from the table.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," she said. "Thank you for everything."</p>

  <p>The Manchester man watched her progress through the lounge. She seemed to
  steer a way amid the crowd by instinct, for she looked ahead as though she
  were seeing one face only, smiling at her at the end of a long road.</p>

  <p>He grunted and then slumped back in his chair as he began to revise his
  engagement list. Presently he was joined by his wife&mdash;a massive woman
  with a pleasant face. She had accompanied him to London for the trip and also
  to keep an eye upon him.</p>

  <p>According to custom, he told her dutifully about his promise to Ann. His
  story got the usual reception, while she hid her pride in his unselfish
  character.</p>

  <p>"Just like you, Will. Even more daft than usual. I've no patience with
  headstrong girls who run into scrapes and expect other people to get them
  out. You've a heavy day to-morrow and you need the sleep you can get. You
  might consider you owe your loyalty to me and the girls. Besides what you
  propose is utterly useless."</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because if she runs into danger, by the time you could take any sort of
  action, it would be too late to save her."</p>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">Ann's heart beat fast as she rose in the lift up to the
  fifth floor. It was difficult to believe that somewhere in the blackness of
  the countryside was the dark pile of Ganges&mdash;the focal point for six
  sentimental pilgrims. Her search through a postal directory had established
  its existence and also the fact that its owner was still Sir Benjamin
  Watson.</p>

  <p>"No stable jobs for us," she chuckled. "I'm glad Richard has not
  cashed-in."</p>

  <p>When she reached her room, it was still too early to start, so she lay on
  her bed and smoked while she recalled the journey out to Ganges. The Sullied
  Souls always met at Piccadilly Circus Underground Station, where&mdash;after
  a race down the escalators&mdash;they crowded into the first train. Every one
  talked and nobody listened as they shouted across the carriage, swaying from
  straphangers and treading on the toes of other passengers.</p>

  <p>Afterwards came the interlude of the bus ride through dark lonely country
  lanes&mdash;so dimly visible in the rush of light from their window, that
  they seemed to be on a ship, ploughing through cold still waters in search of
  adventure.</p>

  <p>High up in her hotel room, Ann watched the smoke curling from her
  cigarette as she thought of her companions. All had one thing in
  common&mdash;the name of an English king or queen. Isabella was doubly royal,
  since her first name was "Mary."</p>

  <p>"Stephen, Richard, Victoria, Ann, Isabella, James and John," recited
  Ann.</p>

  <p>James was pale, rather fleshy and smooth-haired. He wore thick glasses and
  in spite of his youth, his clothes suggested a prosperous professional man.
  Victoria had an oval expressionless face, black almond eyes and a straight
  fringe. Her hands were strong with square-tipped fingers which repelled Ann
  because of Victoria's passion for dissection.</p>

  <p>These were the two students who always got the highest marks in
  examinations, but Ann credited them only with brains which could register
  degrees like a gas-cooker. Their useful glow was incomparable with the
  brilliant fire of other Souls. She regarded Isabella as a genius, even while
  she chose perversely to concentrate on the development of her
  personality.</p>

  <p>She reminded Ann of a picture she had seen of a fatal light which lured
  benighted travellers into a bog. Behind the flame was lightly sketched a face
  of unearthly beauty and allure. Isabella had similar delicate
  features&mdash;the same fastidious lips and elfin gleam in her eyes. She was
  provocative, impersonal and elusive&mdash;attracting masculine homage only to
  reject it.</p>

  <p>John was her opposite number&mdash;an arrogant golden youth, fair,
  fascinating and unstable. He assumed the devilry of a Mayfair playboy and
  dissipated his talents in versatility; but Ann was too dazzled by his
  personality to be critical. In her deep humility, she worshipped both John
  and Isabella with the gaping admiration of a tourist in a hall of immortal
  statues. She expected no notice from them and she received none, but their
  indifference could not hurt her because she was deeply in love with
  Stephen.</p>

  <p>At the age of sixteen, she concentrated upon him the force of a strong and
  steadfast nature. Sitting silent at the meetings, she used to watch his face
  and treasure his words. She retained vivid memories of the way his hair grew
  and the clean-cut corners of his mouth. Unhappily, she felt so sure that he
  must be in her life forever, that she never dreamed of any parting.</p>

  <p>The news of the family departure to Burma left her stunned with shock. At
  the time, she was too bewildered with the rush and too modest and doubtful of
  his interest in her, even to write him a note of farewell. Her only
  consolation was the prospect of her return to England and the hope of meeting
  him again.</p>

  <p>As years passed and she remained in exile, she tried to obtain his
  address, only to meet with repeated disappointments. Letter after letter
  returned to her with a faithful instinct which rivalled her own loyalty. But
  whenever she felt loneliest, she looked at the ringed figures in her
  calendar...Every thought and every action led up to a date.</p>

  <p>And that date was to-night.</p>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">She jumped off her bed, drew a fur coat over her suit and
  pulled a discouraging little hat&mdash;sold to her as the latest
  fashion&mdash;over one eye. A few minutes later she was on her way to the
  reunion, sinking downward in the lift and pushing through the crowded
  vestibule. She carried a gas-mask and a pocket-torch, but in spite of their
  reminds of war conditions, she had not realised the completeness of the
  black-out.</p>

  <p>When she had passed through the revolving-doors, the light gradually
  dimmed until she swung round to face a wall of darkness. While her eyes were
  still dazzled from the illumination of the lounge, it seemed an absolute
  eclipse. Presently, however, she distinguished faint gleams from passing
  traffic and circles mottling the pavement, thrown downward by electric
  torches. She could see no pedestrians while she heard voices and footsteps,
  as though the city were inhabited by an invisible race; but as she lingered
  in the entrance, she collided with a solid body.</p>

  <p>Someone wished to enter the hotel. Stepping aside, she stared before her,
  when she became aware gradually of blurred shapes passing by. They were so
  dim and formless that they suggested survivors from a prehistoric race,
  groping in their eternal midnight. But as her eyes adapted themselves to the
  black-out the scene became more normal.</p>

  <p>As she watched it she had a sense of being cheated. When she had looked
  forward to this moment, she had visualised a pre-war London&mdash;the
  brilliant street lights, the changing colours of advertisement signs and the
  glowing façades of theatres and cinemas. It was a keen disappointment and
  made her apprehensive of the future.</p>

  <p>"I expect they are all waiting for me in the Underground," she thought
  hopefully.</p>

  <p>The station was only a few yards from the hotel and she crossed the narrow
  street in a reckless rush. As she was stumbling down the steps of the nearest
  entrance she saw the light of the booking-hall around the corner, as though
  in fulfilment of her dreams. Instantly the years were forgotten and it seemed
  only yesterday that she hurried down the subway in her eagerness to meet her
  companions.</p>

  <p>Breaking into a run, she burst into the hall, expecting to hear her name
  called by a familiar voice. When no one claimed her, she paused to look
  around her. After years spent in solitude, she got an impression of confusion
  and haste. Every one appeared to be in a hurry to get home. On that evening,
  there were only a few loiterers and there seemed to be no friendly
  reunions.</p>

  <p>Standing in their usual place she looked at the clock.</p>

  <p>"It's the time we always met," she reflected. "I'd better stay put."</p>

  <p>As the minutes passed, she grew too impatient to stand and watch the
  constant stream of passengers, so she went in search of the others. After she
  had completed the round of the booking-hall without meeting any one who
  resembled a Sullied Soul, she felt chilled with fresh disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we've passed without recognising each other," she thought. "I
  wonder if I've changed much."</p>

  <p>She tried to stare impersonally into a strip of mirror at the back of a
  shop window. It reflected a tall slender girl, wearing a closely-fitting
  nigger-brown suit under an open fur coat. Her dark hair waved to her
  shoulders and her eyes glowed with excitement in a pale anxious face.</p>

  <p>"Actually I look younger," she decided. "It's the short skirt and the kid
  hair style. I've lost weight too. But really there's nothing to it. I ought
  to recognise them."</p>

  <p>She told herself that in the course of seven years, no one would grow bald
  or acquire a stomach of the first magnitude. A girl might change the colour
  of her hair or a man might grow a beard, but the salient features would
  remain. She was trying to pierce problematic disguises when she noticed that
  the hands of the clock pointed to a quarter to seven.</p>

  <p>It was the accustomed signal to wait no longer for stragglers but to dash
  down to the train. Since she had committed herself to a time-table which
  covered the hours of eight to twelve, it was important to keep to
  schedule.</p>

  <p>Her face dulled as she stood on the descending escalator, since there was
  no rival Atlanta to race down the steps. Boarding a train in dignity, she
  managed to procure a seat. In spite of these improved conditions, the
  carriage appeared a dull place minus Genius and Beauty, to proclaim their
  opinions, without deference to the corns or ear-drums of the Public.</p>

  <p>As she looked around her, the various uniforms reminded her that she
  intended to get into one of the Services as soon as possible. Crediting her
  companions with her own patriotism, she considered an ominous explanation for
  their absence.</p>

  <p>"Of course, they've all joined up and can't get leave. Actually I'd
  forgotten the war. And the war's too big for me to fight. What's the good of
  going on?"</p>

  <p>Even as she weakened, she recalled her dominant purpose.</p>

  <p>"I <i>must</i> go on or I'll never see Stephen again. It's my only chance.
  Ganges is all that matters. If Richard isn't there to open the door. I must
  get inside the tower-room somehow. I must stay there from eight to twelve, on
  the chance that Stephen might come to the reunion. If he doesn't come,
  someone else must remember the date. That person may tell me where to find
  Stephen."</p>

  <p>Then the light returned to her eyes at a further reflection.</p>

  <p>"What a mug. I expected them to meet at Piccadilly Circus, when they are
  all scattered. They will be coming from different stations. One of them might
  even be coming on this train."</p>

  <p>She thought of them set at various points in a circle and gradually
  drawing together, like the spokes of a wheel, until they met at Ganges. As
  she smiled, a man&mdash;hatless and wearing a belted camel-coat&mdash;stared
  at her as though he interpreted her smile as an overture, but lacked energy
  to follow it up. He was tall and heavily-built, with a gross handsome face
  and dull eyes devoid of a spark of spirit.</p>

  <p>Ann could not understand her instinctive recoil, until she got a clue from
  his hair, gleaming under a light. It was very fair and had a strong natural
  wave. She knew that she disliked him because it was too easy to imagine him
  as a slender blond youth with a clear-cut arrogant face and sparkling blue
  eyes&mdash;a golden youth who might resemble John.</p>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">She fought the suggestion.</p>

  <p>"<i>No</i>. I won't believe it. It's not John. He couldn't have changed so
  much in seven years...Besides, he doesn't know me. That proves he is a
  stranger."</p>

  <p>She was grateful when the train ran into the open and the reduced lighting
  of the carriage made it impossible for her to see him clearly; but she was
  vaguely disturbed by the fact that&mdash;while the train grew emptier at
  every station&mdash;he did not leave his seat. When the terminus was reached,
  as she climbed the stairs, she could distinguish the blur of his light coat
  in front of her.</p>

  <p>After she passed through the screens of the booking-hall, she came out in
  what appeared to be total blackness. With the exception of some stars, the
  night was clouded and unusually dark. As she waited, she saw moving lights,
  rather like the coals of a dying fire, and realised they were the dimmed
  lamps of motor traffic.</p>

  <p>She felt both bewildered and nervous as she remembered that she had to
  cross the road to reach the bus stop. She was further worried by the
  recollection that the buses to Yellow-forge ran infrequently and that the
  Souls used to sprint to make their connection. Although she knew that the
  timetable was probably altered, she dared not linger outside the tube
  station.</p>

  <p>When she tried to reach the other side, she found that she had lost her
  traffic-sense completely. After deciding that some feeble oncoming lights
  were still safely distant, she was about to dash in front of them, when she
  was arrested by the finding of brakes and a burst of profanity from the
  driver. At the same time, someone gripped her arm and dragged her back to the
  pavement. She thought instinctively of the man with the debased face, so it
  was a relief to hear a woman's voice.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know better than to cross against the lights?" it asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Ann frankly, "I don't."</p>

  <p>When she explained the circumstances, her rescuer grew friendly.</p>

  <p>"I'm from the Dominions myself," she said. "Australia."</p>

  <p>"How lovely," said Ann enviously. "It's daylight there."</p>

  <p>"And real sunshine. I'm in the A.T.S. I'll see you across Jordan. Look,
  there's the amber. The lights are going to change. <i>Now</i>."</p>

  <p>Armed by the friendly Australian, Ann crossed the road safely and was
  steered to a darkened vehicle which was on the point of starting.</p>

  <p>"Yellow-forge bus," said the uniformed girl, pushing Ann up the steps.
  "Good-bye. Happy landing."</p>

  <p>As the bus moved on, Ann congratulated herself on her progress. The most
  difficult part of her journey was over as she would alight just outside the
  gates of Ganges. When the conductress came to collect her fare, she
  remembered the name of the stage&mdash;King William the Fourth&mdash;a small
  public-house.</p>

  <p>After she received her ticket she was able to relax. Her watch told her
  that she had time in hand, even if she had some difficulty in locating the
  tower-door in the black-out. She could see nothing of the countryside, but
  there was the old sense of adventure&mdash;of being on a mystery cruise over
  some fabulous sea&mdash;as the darkness flowed past.</p>

  <p>"Every yard, every second is taking me nearer to Stephen," she
  thought.</p>

  <p>Conscious that she was growing sleepy from the strain of peering through
  the gummed muslin which protected the window, she looked down the dimly-lit
  vehicle.</p>

  <p>To her dismay, the seat in front of her was occupied by the big fat man
  who was a caricature of a mature John. She stared at the roll of fat on his
  neck and his thick wavy hair while she tried to subdue her panic.</p>

  <p>"It's <i>not</i> John. He's not going to Ganges. It's just coincidence
  he's on the Yellow-forge bus."</p>

  <p>Unfortunately the shock of seeing him had awakened all the latent fears
  which the kindly Manchester man had sown in her mind. She began to wonder
  whether Ganges existed only within the pages of the telephone directory.
  After every blitz, houses remained listed, although they were reduced to
  rubble. Presently she could endure the suspense no longer and appealed to the
  conductress.</p>

  <p>"I want to get out at Ganges. Will you please tell me when we come to
  it."</p>

  <p>"Ganges?" repeated the girl doubtfully. "Do you mean the Zoo?"</p>

  <p>A submerged memory returned to Ann. Although she had never seen Ganges by
  daylight, Richard had boasted about his uncle's collection of wild animals.
  It was a modest one, comprising varieties of deer, a small cat house, a
  monkey colony and a penguin pool, yet it was a source of heavy
  expenditure.</p>

  <p>"Big Ben's spending a fortune on the blighters," grumbled Richard. "He's
  trying to reproduce their natural surroundings, to kid them they're not in
  captivity. It suits me as I've got my hoof well in. There's a tribe of
  relatives&mdash;pedigree and mongrels&mdash;but I'm the only blighter that's
  up in zoology. The idea is I'm Big Ben's heir, on condition I keep on the
  Zoo."</p>

  <p>As she remembered the explanation, Ann accepted the existence of the Zoo
  as comforting proof of the survival of Ganges.</p>

  <p>"So the Zoo's still there?" she remarked as a feeler.</p>

  <p>She realised that she had introduced a controversial subject when a big
  shapeless woman who resembled Mrs. Noah, spoke sharply.</p>

  <p>"Yes, still here, but it wouldn't be if it wasn't a rich man's hobby. It's
  a proper scandal and it didn't ought to be winked at."</p>

  <p>"Hush, Ma," said a girl's voice. "It's no business of ours."</p>

  <p>"Maybe not, but I speak for others. What about young Perce?"</p>

  <p>An invisible man, sitting further down the bus, defended the Zoo.</p>

  <p>"Sir Benjamin's all right. Hasn't he promised to give a Spitfire? He can
  spend his money as he likes. Young Perce had no business to climb railings.
  He was trespassing."</p>

  <p>"The poor lad said he lost his way in the dark&mdash;and he had to
  deliver."</p>

  <p>"He should have delivered his groceries by daylight. He was a darn fool to
  go wandering about the grounds in the black-out."</p>

  <p>"You're telling me," agreed the matron. "You wouldn't catch me in there,
  not if the king asked me to meet him. You might stumble against
  <i>anything</i> in the dark."</p>

  <p>The conductress interrupted the discussion by ringing her bell.</p>

  <p>"Ganges," she announced. "Take care, miss."</p>

  <p>As she got up Ann glanced apprehensively at the back of the big fair man,
  but to her great relief, he did not rise from his seat. Evidently Ganges
  meant nothing to him. He was still motionless when she looked after the bus,
  rolling again on its way.</p>

  <p>"Thank goodness," she muttered. "That's the end of him."</p>

  <p>Snapping on her torch, she saw before her the familiar entrance to Ganges,
  where stone pillars were crowned with roughly-carved elephants. On one post a
  notice was displayed&mdash;"WARNING. PRIVATE ZOO. KEEP TO PATH."</p>

  <p>She felt a thrill when she pushed open one heavy wrought-iron gate,
  Stephen was only just around the bend. But even as she exulted, she started
  at a low noise. It was distant&mdash;yet it seemed to stir the air&mdash;a
  heavy sawing sound with a shattering quality&mdash;like a snarl imprisoned in
  a roll of thunder. For a moment she thought it was a train coughing in a
  tunnel, but as it was repeated she recognised it.</p>

  <p>It was the roar of a lion.</p>

  <h3>VII.</h3>

  <p class="first">In that moment, her courage died and she turned to run. The
  gossip in the bus acquired a double-edge as she realised that the Zoo was no
  longer the Garden of Eden of seven years before. It contained savage beasts
  which were controlled by human agency...And it was admitted that the personal
  element is fallible.</p>

  <p>A few steps across the road would bring her flush with the little public
  house which was a fare stage. Common sense urged her to catch the next bus
  back to the tube terminus. It would stop by the station entrance and from
  there, it was almost a straight run back into her bedroom at the hotel.</p>

  <p>As she hesitated, she remembered one of the rare occasions in the past
  when Stephen had seemed aware of her existence.</p>

  <p>"Promise me you'll never meet Richard alone, or go to Ganges without the
  gang," he said earnestly.</p>

  <p>"But you're pally with him," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Different for me. I cultivate him because he's such a clever devil. He's
  a sadist and he talks a lot of smut, but when I've chucked out the husks, I
  can usually get a grain of something useful from him."</p>

  <p>He added abruptly, "Don't be impressed by the parrot-talk you hear at
  Ganges. There's nothing to it. The monkeys at the Zoo can put on a better
  show."</p>

  <p>At that moment she felt the force of his warning. But the memory had
  reminded her too vividly of Stephen. After waiting seven years for this
  evening, it would be contemptible cowardice to turn back. All she had to do
  was to obey instructions&mdash;"KEEP TO PATH"&mdash;and she would be
  safe.</p>

  <p>When she flashed her torch before her, she was relieved to see that the
  way was marked with whitened stones. She was surprised to find it
  unchanged&mdash;going uphill and into hollows&mdash;because the gossip in the
  bus had led her to expect altered conditions. When she left England, Sir
  Benjamin Watson was not only wealthy but he had expectations from a
  millionaire uncle who was being kept alive, in spite of the total loss of his
  faculties from senile decay.</p>

  <p>The fact that Sir Benjamin had given a Spitfire to the nation seemed to
  prove that he had come into his inheritance and was now a very rich man. In
  the circumstances, it seemed strange to find no improvements in the property.
  Ganges was built on rough rising ground and its natural features were
  preserved without any attempt at landscape-gardening. There was a ravine, a
  wood, a lake and a hillock, while the house was reached by a path which
  climbed a humpy pasture.</p>

  <p>Soon Ann began to regret the absence of a properly-made drive. Whoever was
  responsible for blazing out the trail had apparently assumed that strangers
  were as familiar with the scene as himself. In places the number of stones
  was skimped and the white paint had worn off so many that it became difficult
  to keep to the path. She felt ruts underfoot and blundered into a bush which
  blocked her way, only to find on the other side a field of coarse grass,
  unbroken by any track.</p>

  <p>As she stopped to plot her course she thought of the unlucky errand-boy
  who had lost his way also. Her presence was unauthorised&mdash;even as
  his&mdash;and she must accept any consequence of trespassing on forbidden
  territory.</p>

  <p>"Go on?" she asked herself. "Or go back and try to find where I went
  wrong? But Perce climbed palings, so the big idea would be to avoid
  short-cuts...I'll go on."</p>

  <p>She had hardly made the decision when she found her way blocked by a
  strong stockade.</p>

  <p>"Palings," she said. "Definitely this is where I go back."</p>

  <p>While she stood there she heard voices on the other side of the enclosure.
  They were too far away for successful listening-in, but she got the
  impression of an argument. One voice sounded so blurred and stupid as to be
  unhuman; it seemed to protest against some course while the other voice urged
  encouragement.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she managed to distinguish words. "All right...Come on, old
  man...Sleep it off...Soon be all right."</p>

  <p>"Well," she reflected, "if one of them is Caliban, the other appears to be
  civilised. If I could make him hear he might direct me to the tower
  door."</p>

  <p>Before she could cup her mouth something blotted out the stars in the
  patch of sky before her&mdash;something long and sinuous that writhed in the
  air like a serpent.</p>

  <p>She recognised it as an elephant's trunk and turned to run. Had it been
  daylight, she would have felt no fear, but the darkness turned any encounter
  into a risk of being crushed. Mrs. Noah, in the bus, had declared that you
  might stumble upon anything. She realised that the country people were
  strongly opposed to the Zoo and that probably they had good reason for their
  indignation.</p>

  <p>Although the monster was on the other side of the palings, those blurred
  voices had destroyed her confidence. If a keeper were drunk, he might leave a
  gate open, so that the animals could wander over the pasture. Flashing her
  torch before her she stumbled wildly down a slope, until the light shone on a
  line of uneven white stones.</p>

  <p>In her fright she had forgotten the reunion and the tower-room. With a
  shock of surprise she found herself in a small paved courtyard which seemed
  familiar. There was a sundial in the centre and a damp flagged path led up to
  a small lancet-shaped wooden door.</p>

  <p>It was the entrance to the tower-room. When she turned the handle she
  discovered that it was unlocked, as though in expectation of guests. She
  entered a dark lobby and stood at the foot of the winding stone stair,
  listening for the sound of voices from above. In the old days one always
  heard the excited hum, like grasshoppers on a hot day. But now the only sound
  was a distant elephant's trumpet&mdash;high and thin as though it were
  calling a retreat.</p>

  <p>A rush of questions hurtled in her mind. Was any one waiting up in the
  tower? <i>Who</i> would it be? Stephen&mdash;or Richard, against whom she had
  been warned? When she remembered the myriad times she had looked forward to
  that moment, it seemed ironic that she actually feared to mount the steps. At
  last she found the courage and crept upwards, straining her ears for any
  sound that might warn her of danger.</p>

  <p>As she reached the last spiral she saw a beam of electric light shining
  from the tower-room. This was contrary to precedent, for their meetings were
  lit only by the flames from a coal fire. As she saw the place distinctly for
  the first time, its glamour was destroyed with its loss of mystery. It was
  smaller than she had imagined, with blacked-out windows set high in the
  walls. There were the same shabby divan and chairs which were never occupied,
  since they preferred to sprawl upon cushions piled before the fire. The table
  at the back which used to be crowded with bottles and heaped plates now held
  only a decanter. The grate was empty and its coals replaced with
  electric-current.</p>

  <p>Someone was sitting slumped in one of the deep chairs. He rose as she
  entered and held out an unsteady hand. It was a big fair man&mdash;her
  fellow-passenger in the train and bus.</p>

  <p>"Hallo," he said. "Who are you? I am John."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-02"
     id="ch-02"></a>II. &mdash; "SULLIED SOULS"</h2>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">THE shock of the encounter was so heavy that it left Ann
  stunned and incredulous. She felt she was in a nightmare where the dreamer
  has only to dread something to make it happen. If she had not traced a
  debased likeness to John in her fellow-passenger, this impostor would not
  have crashed his way to the reunion.</p>

  <p>Her confusion was increased by the fact that she could not account for his
  presence. The last time she had seen him, he was half-asleep in the bus,
  rolling on towards Yellow-forge. She was positive that no one had followed
  her through the gates of Ganges. Yet the litter of cigarette ash upon the
  table was proof that he had been smoking in the tower-room for some time
  before her own arrival.</p>

  <p>He typified the unwelcome change which the Manchester man had warned her
  to expect. Since she had begun her journey everything had been different. She
  had met with new features, each of which held a certain degree of horror; the
  black-out, the roar of a lion, a drunken mumble of protest&mdash;all these
  led up to this crowning disappointment.</p>

  <p>It was in vain that she tried to thrill at the knowledge that she was
  actually inside the tower-room&mdash;the scene of her happiest memories. Only
  by closing her eyes could she see it again in the leaping firelight which lit
  up youthful faces and accentuated the mystery of the shadowed
  background...Now it was stripped of glamour as the crude light glared down on
  it, exposing its bare discomfort and revealing the inflamed face of the fair
  stranger.</p>

  <p>Instead of answering his question she unzipped her bag and drew out a
  dog-eared grubby card which she laid on the table.</p>

  <p>"There's some mistake," she said coldly. "You are a stranger to me. I've
  come here for a reunion. Here's proof of my identity."</p>

  <p>Instead of showing signs of confusion, a slow smile spread over the
  impostor's face. After fumbling in his wallet, he slapped down a similar card
  over hers, like a child playing "Snap."</p>

  <p>"This is wizard," he said. "Someone's remembered the jolly old reunion.
  But who the hell are you?"</p>

  <p>She gazed steadily into his dull eyes.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't remember me," she told him, "because you are not a member of
  our secret society. You don't know our names and you never knew them. So it
  can mean nothing to you if I tell you I am 'Ann.'"</p>

  <p>"Ann?" he repeated stupidly. "Ann was the silent kid who never giggled or
  flirted. No, <i>you'</i>re not Ann. You're trying to put a fast one over me
  because I'm tight. But I've seen you somewhere before...Give me time.
  Something's going to click here."</p>

  <p>He touched his head and then snapped his fingers.</p>

  <p>"I know. You're the girl in the train. You tried to get off with me. Sorry
  I couldn't follow it up, my dear. Another engagement. This...But you've no
  business here. I know you are not Ann."</p>

  <p>"And I know you've stolen John's card. What have you done to him?"</p>

  <p>The man ignored the charge as he stared at her with puzzled eyes.</p>

  <p>"Actually I believe it <i>is</i> Ann," he said after a pause. "I'm
  beginning to recognise bits and pieces. It's Ann grown into a beautiful lady
  like the advertisement...What soap is it? I forget...But it's our Ann. Come
  to my heart."</p>

  <p>Before she could protest, he crushed her in his arms and began to dance
  but after a few staggering revolutions, he released her and dropped into a
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he apologised, "can't keep an even keel. Room's too small...Ann,
  I've always wanted to meet you again, to ask you something. It's been biting
  me all these years...Remember our last night when I kissed you in the bus.
  Instead of biffing me, like you used to, you let me. It was like kissing cold
  fish...Now that was out of character&mdash;and I've often wondered
  <i>why</i>."</p>

  <p>Ann dared not trust her voice to speak. In that memory John had given her
  positive proof of his identity.</p>

  <p>She remembered how she had hoped that Stephen would sit beside her in the
  bus, on their homeward way, but John was first to slip into the vacant seat.
  Her disappointment was so keen that she was dead to sensation and had been
  scarcely conscious of the kiss.</p>

  <p>As she remained silent, John picked up his card and began to re-read
  it.</p>

  <p>"Insulting tripe," he said. "Typical of Richard. Remember his stable jobs?
  Joke is, they've got elephants now. Actually they have everything. The old
  man's potty on his zoo. Gives the animals a home from home, on the model of a
  happy Christian family; mister, missus and <i>Tertium Quid</i>."</p>

  <p>"I wonder Richard isn't here," remarked Ann dully. "Perhaps he's
  forgotten."</p>

  <p>"He had forgotten all right and so had Isabella. I was the faithful hound
  who remembered. Touching, but I loved those old days. But when I reminded
  Richard of the reunion he was quite keen. Hopes to gloat over our failures.
  Remember this register?"</p>

  <p>He fumbled under his evening paper which was thrown upon the table and
  produced a double sheet of stiff paper. It was yellow with age and bore seven
  signatures.</p>

  <p>"It's the roll call he made us sign our last evening," explained John.
  "His idea is we all sign on again. Evidence of attendance at his reunion, in
  black and white...Now watch me sign on the dotted line. Darling, which of
  them is the dotted line? Just guide my hand to the starting-post."</p>

  <p>While he was scrawling with an unsteady hand, Ann looked over his shoulder
  at the list of names. At the sight of one signature, she forgot her first
  disappointment and was glad of John's presence. She realised that he might be
  able to give her news about Stephen; but because she dreaded his ridicule,
  she made an oblique approach.</p>

  <p>"Have you kept in touch with any of the Sullied Souls, John?"</p>

  <p>"All of them," he replied.</p>

  <p>"<i>Oh</i>. Have they changed much?"</p>

  <p>"Only in spots. Richard and Isabella are the same&mdash;only more so."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad Isabella is still beautiful. Did she have a career?"</p>

  <p>"Someone else's. She married and scoops in the dough. Victoria is a
  doctor. Got a practice up north. She had an Old Age Pension, looking after
  Big Ben's old uncle&mdash;but he died on her...Poor devil. Fancy having to
  die, looking at <i>that</i>."</p>

  <p>Ann's heart beat faster. She was getting nearer to Stephen's name. Only
  one other Sullied Soul blocked the way.</p>

  <p>"James?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"He's a prosperous bloke. Lectures and coaches in biology, plus
  sidelines."</p>

  <p>"And Stephen?"</p>

  <p>"Who's he? Never heard of the chap."</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">The check was so unexpected that Ann felt as though she had
  run into a brick wall.</p>

  <p>"You must remember Stephen," she insisted. "He was leader."</p>

  <p>"No," corrected John. "Richard was leader."</p>

  <p>"But Stephen was leader of the opposition. He never let Richard get away
  with anything."</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>that</i> blighter." John blew out his cheeks. "I'd clean forgotten
  him. He was a dirty spoilsport. He never let any of us make a pass at
  you."</p>

  <p>Ann was sidetracked by her own astonishment. Her inferiority complex had
  caused her to worship her companions in silence, but she had no idea of the
  attraction of her youthful gravity, founded on experience. While the others
  shouted their views on those subjects which are dealt with adequately in
  realistic novels, she, alone, had first-hand knowledge of poverty, alcoholism
  and the symptoms of certain unadvertised illnesses.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe you," she said. "No one would want to make a pass at me.
  I was so stupidly young."</p>

  <p>"That was the attraction," chuckled John. "You were young. We only had the
  other girls to get you."</p>

  <p>Although she felt sure that he was lying, it thrilled Ann to hear that
  Stephen had acted as her guardian angel.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you heard <i>anything</i> about Stephen?" she persisted.</p>

  <p>"No," replied John. "He just dropped out. While we are waiting, what about
  a spot?"</p>

  <p>It did not need a specialised knowledge to tell her that John had already
  drunk more than he could carry. She caught his arm before his fingers closed
  around the decanter.</p>

  <p>"We must wait for Richard," she said. "If we don't we are giving him a
  swell chance to insult us...Tell me about yourself. What's your work?"</p>

  <p>To her relief he swallowed the bait of her assumed interest.</p>

  <p>"I'm a journalist," he replied.</p>

  <p>"That's brainy. Are you married?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you can call it that. I've certain matrimonial privileges. I feed
  a lady with expensive tastes and I pay her dress bills. Another chap gets all
  the rest. That's modern marriage...Ann, I could kill that other chap."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Because I can never keep track of him. He's always a different
  chap...Ann, I'm going to ask you something and I want a straight answer...Why
  didn't you recognise me?"</p>

  <p>"If it comes to that, why didn't you recognise me?"</p>

  <p>"Because you've grown into a glamour girl. But I can't see how I've
  changed. I look the same in the glass. Filled out a bit, of course, but my
  hair's still thick and I don't give at the knees. Last time you saw me what
  was I like?"</p>

  <p>"Like a young Greek god."</p>

  <p>Directly she spoke, Ann regretted her words because of the misery in
  John's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Don't know any gods," he said with a forced laugh. "They're not in my
  street. But I get the idea. No pubs in Elysium. That what you
  mean?...Actually, I can't write unless I'm boozed and I have an expensive
  wife. Disgusted?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not." Ann felt a rush of sympathy. "I'm only sorry. Can't you
  shake out of it?"</p>

  <p>"Actually, I could. Nobody would believe this, but really I am a domestic
  chap. I want a home and kids. And I could have them, even now. There's the
  right sort of girl in my life&mdash;a girl who would pick up my bits and make
  them into a man. None of your cock-eyed gods."</p>

  <p>It was characteristic of Ann to go to the point.</p>

  <p>"Can you get a divorce from your wife?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Definitely," John assured her. "Any number of them. Actually I'm too weak
  to make the break. I've got her under my skin. That kind of hold."</p>

  <p>"Still, I wish you could. I'd like to think of you with a happy ending,
  John, because of those old days."</p>

  <p>She realised that her sympathy was a mistake when John began to gulp. To
  stop him from becoming maudlin, she asked him a question.</p>

  <p>"How did you get here before me? I left you in the bus."</p>

  <p>"I baled out about half a mile further on. There's a new entrance
  now&mdash;a short-cut to the house, all uphill and up steps."</p>

  <p>As he explained, John drummed with his fingers on the table and glanced
  pointedly at the decanter.</p>

  <p>"What do we do now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I stay here until twelve," Ann told him. "I want to meet the others."</p>

  <p>"If I hunt round I might produce Richard and Isabella. You can wash out
  the rest. Too far for Victoria to come out of sentiment, for she's got none.
  And there's no money in it for James."</p>

  <p>"There's still Stephen."</p>

  <p>"That bloke again? He's dead. Must be. There's a war on. He's either one
  of the Few or one of the Great Majority. Same thing in the end."</p>

  <p>"No, he's not dead. I know he's alive. He must be."</p>

  <p>John stopped drumming the table and looked at her with troubled eyes.</p>

  <p>"It's getting plain to me why you've come," he said. "Ann, do believe me.
  It's a hundred to one chance you will meet him here. Take my tip and
  go&mdash;at once&mdash;while the going's good."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"You may well ask. Do you remember Richard's hooded look?"</p>

  <p>Ann nodded as she remembered how occasionally Richard seemed to withdraw
  himself completely behind the shutter of leaden drooped lids. At such moments
  she felt acutely apprehensive and prayed that she might never see his eyes
  lest they revealed too much. She still felt chilled as John went on
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"I bumped into Richard outside, on my way up. He was running like
  hell&mdash;and he had his hooded look...That means it's not safe to hang
  around. It means that things are going to happen. And when things happen he
  doesn't want people there to see them happen. If they did catch on, well, it
  might be too bad for them...Got the idea?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You're trying to make me windy. But it's childish. If Richard were a
  criminal lunatic, he'd be certified. Besides why should he pick on me to
  attack, especially here with people round? He has no interest in me, one way
  or the other."</p>

  <p>After a struggle, John managed to rise from his chair. He lurched to the
  door&mdash;listened&mdash;and then closed it.</p>

  <p>"You've forgotten one thing," he said. "Richard is in control of this
  outfit and he's got a queer sense of humour. He's got us to come here on the
  Q.T. Don't you think a Zoo rather a loaded toy for him to play about
  with?"</p>

  <p>Although Ann remembered her fright when she blundered up against the
  elephant-house, she summoned her common sense.</p>

  <p>"The animals are all safe in cages," she said. "Are they specially
  savage?"</p>

  <p>"Good grief, no. Tame as kittens. Richard and the old man take them about
  on leads, like dogs. They're bred in captivity and used to private baths and
  bedside telephones. But my point is this. They can be frightened. Suppose any
  one threw a lighted cracker when Big Ben was passing with one of his kittens,
  what price his control then?...Ann, go back before you meet Richard again.
  He's out of your life. For the love of Mike don't let him in again."</p>

  <p>Ann smiled at him as she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"John, you're rather sweet," she told him. "But get a load of this. I've
  come to the reunion. That stands."</p>

  <p>He looked at her firm lips and his own trembled as though he regretted the
  contrast. Seeking consolation his hand moved towards the decanter but he drew
  it back again.</p>

  <p>"If it's like that with you," he said, "I'll find the others."</p>

  <p>She guessed his objective was to find a drink elsewhere, but she watched
  him go with a tolerant smile. While she felt she was unqualified to judge him
  without knowledge of the facts, she was filled with anger when she thought of
  the woman who had exploited his weakness.</p>

  <p>"If ever I meet his wife," she thought, "I'm bound to tell her she's a
  stinker."</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">It was a relief to be alone and without John's presence as a
  reminder of destructive change. As she looked around the tower-room, she
  decided that some of its past charm could be restored.</p>

  <p>"Actually it's the same except for the fire," she reflected. "I never saw
  it properly before, so I imagined it. That's all there is to it. I'll fix
  it."</p>

  <p>Zealous as an A.R.P. warden, she mounted a chair and drew down a shade of
  dark-blue crinkled paper which had been rolled back. It shrouded the bulb and
  reduced the illumination to a funereal gloom, only relieved by the radiance
  of the electric fire. Once again there was shadowed mystery as the walls
  shrank into invisibility, like pimpernels closing before the threat of
  rain.</p>

  <p>Brooding alone in the warmth, Ann recaptured some of the spell of the
  past. It seemed to her rather like a miracle to be actually back inside the
  tower-room. All that had happened that evening was but the prelude to the
  real adventure. A few false notes had been struck and the limiting had been
  too strong&mdash;but such slight hitches would be forgotten when the curtain
  rose.</p>

  <p>Her tranquillity was suddenly shattered by a low rasping sound. It was not
  a roar, but rather like a purr which thickened intermittently to a snarl, as
  though in hint of underlying menace. She could not locate it, but it seemed
  to be everywhere at the same time&mdash;above, below and all around
  her&mdash;throbbing on the air like a fevered pulse or a distant gong.</p>

  <p>"It's near," she thought. "Close to the house. Or even inside."</p>

  <p>In the silence that followed, her imagination broke loose from her control
  and ran wild. She had a horrible suspicion that Richard was indulging his
  cankered sense of humour and unleashing a tigress to act as lady-receptionist
  at the reunion.</p>

  <p>"He always hated Stephen," she thought. "Suppose he's planning for him to
  walk into a trap."</p>

  <p>Without care for her own safety, she opened the door and stood on the
  small landing, gazing down into the well of the circular stair. It was too
  dark for her to see the lobby at the bottom but she heard someone coming up
  the steps. Her heart beat faster as she listened, because the footsteps were
  those of a man. They were too steady to be John's, while Richard was unlikely
  to use the outside entrance when a door on the landing led to the main
  staircase of the house.</p>

  <p>The inference was a choice between James and Stephen&mdash;a fifty-fifty
  chance.</p>

  <p>Hope flared up&mdash;to be killed by bitterest disappointment. As she
  threw the light of her torch downwards, it gleamed on black shiny hair on a
  flat head which reminded her vaguely of a snake...Once started, the reunion
  was continuing to function. Within a few seconds she would be linked up again
  with its sinister promotor&mdash;Richard.</p>

  <p>While she waited she grew conscious of miserable seeping fear. It was
  inexplicable in the light of past experience, when her father had
  declared&mdash;in hackneyed phrase&mdash;that she had not a nerve in her
  body. Although she was not so immune as he boasted, during some narrow
  escapes, she had contrived the impression of thumbing her nose at danger.</p>

  <p>As she stood on the landing, she realised that she was missing the
  stimulus of motion. When she was chased by a grizzly&mdash;and when her canoe
  was drawn into rapids, thundering towards the lip of an abyss&mdash;she had
  been sustained by the heat of excitement. She had to run&mdash;to fight; but
  it was a cold-blooded business to wait and listen while the footsteps wound
  around the spiral.</p>

  <p>With an instinct to protect herself, she flashed the light in Richard's
  face when he was a few steps below her. It was evident that he mistook her
  for someone else, for he whispered with savage exultation:</p>

  <p>"It's all right. By now&mdash;he must be dead."</p>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">With an instinctive dread of turning her back upon him, Ann
  receded before his advance into the tower-room.</p>

  <p>"Why this dimness?" he asked harshly. "It seems someone has a sense of
  dramatic values...Stop flashing that light in my eyes. I know you are not
  Isabella. Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Guess," said Ann, snapping off her torch.</p>

  <p>As she looked at him under the shaded bulb, her first impression was that
  he had kept a tally of the years in his face. It was so seamed that, in the
  dim light, he was not unlike a painted brave. She noticed too that he was
  possessed by some violent excitement. His pallid skin glistened and there was
  a curious greenish glare at the back of his eyes. He carried with him a
  strong sweet perfume as of a funeral wreath.</p>

  <p>"You must be Ann," he said, changing his corncrake note to his most
  charming accent. "And a very lovely Ann. Growing-up has suited you better
  than some of us. Do you remember how you used to call John a golden boy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she agreed. "He and Isabella made a perfect pair. A golden girl and
  a golden boy. I used to hate you when you would quote that bit about them
  turning to dust like chimney-sweepers."</p>

  <p>"Actually I was prophetic. But I haven't welcomed you to our reunion,
  Ann."</p>

  <p>As he held both her hands within his moist palms, the artifice of his
  stiff grin made his face resemble a vulpine mask.</p>

  <p>"I hoped you would come," he said, "to renew old contacts and happy
  memories. It will be instructive for you to realise what time can do to us.
  You really must meet John."</p>

  <p>"I have," she said curtly.</p>

  <p>"Then I am sorry I was not there to <i>re</i>-introduce you. I think that
  covers everything."</p>

  <p>In the old days Ann had been too overawed by her brilliant company to
  challenge any statement of Richard's. Therefore it was tonic to her
  self-respect to realise that, in her case, the years had brought courage with
  clearer vision.</p>

  <p>"He seems to have been unlucky in his wife," she remarked.</p>

  <p>Richard cackled softly as he picked up the register from the table.</p>

  <p>"I see John's characteristic signature is here," he said. "Will you sign,
  please. I don't want to think I have dreamed you when I wake up
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>When she returned the paper, Ann was ashamed of her scrawl which was as
  shaky as John's. Conscious of Richard's smile, she tried to explain her
  nervousness.</p>

  <p>"Any one would think I was a hard drinker. Actually I'm so terribly
  excited about the reunion."</p>

  <p>He glanced at her keenly before he spoke in his grand manner.</p>

  <p>"I am flattered that my wish to reassemble you all has met with so much
  response. You must admit I fed and wined my disciples in lavish style. It is
  natural for me to retain my interest in them now they have passed from my
  control. Of course, there will not be a full muster. With Isabella, we are
  four. The betting is no one else will come. But even if one other person
  turns up, there is bound to be one absentee and probably two."</p>

  <p>"That sounds like you," said Ann boldly, forcing her laugh. "You want to
  crab the reunion in advance. But I am counting to meet <i>every
  one</i>&mdash;or our meeting will be spoilt."</p>

  <p>"The faithful heart in real life. Very touching...Where have you been all
  this time and what have you done?"</p>

  <p>"Abroad. The unusual things."</p>

  <p>"You've developed some definite character, Ann. I am looking forward to
  your meeting with Isabella. She's used to playing lead. She&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off when he discovered that she was not listening to him.</p>

  <p>"You appear to have extra keen ears," he remarked. "Can you hear any one
  on the stairs?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." The glow faded from Ann's eyes, "But it's a woman."</p>

  <p>"Then it's probably Isabella. I must warn her about my uncle. He is very
  seriously ill."</p>

  <p>Richard delayed his return for a little time. Straining her ears with
  natural curiosity, Ann caught the sound of a woman's voice cut off in a
  question. As she listened to the buzz of whispers, she wondered whether
  Isabella were married to Richard. Her presence at Ganges, while Sir Benjamin
  was so ill, seemed to point to the fact that she was a resident. Ann
  remembered too that, in the past, she used to annoy Richard by an assumption
  of ownership.</p>

  <p>There seemed no doubt of the identity of their present interests. When the
  pair entered the tower-room, the same unholy fire burned in Isabella's eyes,
  as though to welcome a deferred death.</p>

  <p>"Are they waiting for Sir Benjamin to die to get his money?" she wondered.
  A second thought&mdash;darkly dramatic&mdash;was instantly crushed. "Are they
  planning to murder him to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Meet little Ann," said Richard with a theatrical wave.</p>

  <p>Isabella came forward with outstretched hands. She brought with her light,
  excitement and glamour. The waves of her blonde hair and her silver lamé gown
  gleamed under the veiled pendant. At first glance she appeared to have grown
  more beautiful but as Ann looked closely she felt a sense of loss.</p>

  <p>The faerie gleam had vanished from Isabella's eyes. Now they were pure
  wanton while the lines of her beautiful lips were hard. Gone, too, was her
  mystery and the fugitive quality of her smile. While she might still blind
  and bewilder belated travellers, they would no longer confuse her with the
  Flame which lured them into the bog.</p>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">"Ann," she cried, "how you've changed. You used to be
  adorably dignified and reserved&mdash;unlike any one else. But now you're
  typed. You've developed herd-instinct...Darling, it's divine to see you again
  but I could slay you for spoiling yourself."</p>

  <p>As she listened to the ungenerous greeting, Ann felt the surge of her old
  inferiority complex; but as she continued to look at Isabella she realised
  that life was repaying its debt. For the first time she faced Isabella on
  equal terms.</p>

  <p>"If I followed my crowd," she said, "I should be wearing a bearskin or a
  string of beads. But I never went native, although I have lived in some very
  rough places."</p>

  <p>"The country, I suppose? Wales?"</p>

  <p>"Alaska, Brazil, Africa, America. And the rest."</p>

  <p>"How foul. Didn't you loathe it?"</p>

  <p>"Loved it. I got ingrained dirt in my knees. It made me feel so
  manly."</p>

  <p>Richard's neighing laugh was tribute to Ann's nonchalance.</p>

  <p>"Ann makes us appear quite small town," he remarked to Isabella. "By the
  way, she had met our John Cumberland, Esquire. And now she wants to meet his
  wife. Could it be arranged?"</p>

  <p>"Meet her is the last thing I wish to do," flashed Ann. "I couldn't be too
  far away from her. I've seen what she has done to John."</p>

  <p>Isabella's cheeks suddenly flamed under her rouge and her eyes were
  hostile as she glared at the girl.</p>

  <p>"I reserve my sympathy for his wife," she said.</p>

  <p>"This is where I come in," put in Richard. "Sorry, Ann dear. I forgot to
  tell you that Isabella is Mrs. John Cumberland."</p>

  <p>The news tested Ann's acquired poise severely and made her feel very young
  and inexperienced. Her lips trembled as she realised fully the shoddy shrines
  before which she had worshipped. It was difficult to realise that two hours
  before she was telling the Manchester man about the glory that was
  Ganges.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she murmured.</p>

  <p>Isabella acknowledged her apology with a shrug as she spoke to
  Richard.</p>

  <p>"Cigarette."</p>

  <p>Ann noticed that she could not demonstrate her unconcern without the aid
  of smoke. After blowing a ring, she asked Ann a languid question.</p>

  <p>"What about you? Married?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Ann.</p>

  <p>"Living with a man?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"No personal experience. Good grief, how dull."</p>

  <p>Although the shock of meeting Isabella had hurt her more than the change
  in John, Ann suddenly faced up to reality. She admitted that the brilliant
  company of the Seven Sullied Souls existed only in her imagination. They were
  ordinary clever students whom she had sprinkled with star-dust, glorifying
  charm to beauty and talent to genius.</p>

  <p>"Stephen knew," she thought. "He told me not to be taken in by them
  because they belonged to the monkey-house. They've not changed. They've
  always been a rotten lot. I've been a sucker. But I've lost nothing, for I
  never had it."</p>

  <p>It was a tribute to Stephen's judgment that he had seen always through
  their pose of glib phrases&mdash;garnished with cheap malicious wit and
  lacking ideas or human kindness.</p>

  <p>"I'm safe now," she told herself jubilantly. "I can't be hurt again.
  Stephen is the one that matters. I came to meet <i>him</i>."</p>

  <p>Richard seemed to read her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"I'm not expecting either Dr. Pybus or Professor Short," he said.
  "Victoria and James to you. They are so professional they would shy at
  writing 'Zoo-man' in their engagement-book...That is how they visualise
  me&mdash;with a fork and straw&mdash;perpetually bedding-down beasts...But I
  feel sure Stephen will show up."</p>

  <p>Although she knew her rising colour would betray her secret to Richard,
  Ann asked him an eager question.</p>

  <p>"How do you know? Have you seen him recently?"</p>

  <p>"Very recently," replied Richard. "He looked very fit and all that. R.A.F,
  uniform, of course. They call him 'Lucky Pardon.' He'll come though."</p>

  <p>"Did you mention the reunion?"</p>

  <p>"No, but he did. He talked about you. Asked questions and so on. Of
  course, I couldn't answer them then. But he is hoping to meet you here
  to-night."</p>

  <p>Ann was too dazed with happiness to notice that Isabella was looking at
  Richard through narrowed lids while her lips formed a soundless
  word&mdash;"Liar." Then to her surprise Richard held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I am so glad to have met you again, Ann," he said in his most charming
  voice. "When the war is over we must have a real reunion, with a banquet and
  champagne. But&mdash;as things are&mdash;I have to ask you to go. We are
  expecting my uncle's death at any minute. I should be with him now.
  Good-bye."</p>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">THE blow was so unexpected that Ann was staggered. She had
  been prepared for difficulties and even for danger, but not for a bland
  announcement&mdash;"Not at home."</p>

  <p>The door was slammed in her face.</p>

  <p>"But, Richard," she pleaded, "may I stay up here? I've waited for this
  reunion for so many years. I've been cut off from every one&mdash;and it
  means everything to me. I&mdash;I can't explain. Please, <i>please.</i> I
  won't make a sound. No one will know I'm here."</p>

  <p>"Trust the servants to know," said Isabella. "And trust them to have a
  perfectly good dirty explanation. At a time like this one can't be too
  careful. Richard's the heir&mdash;and his relatives are in the house."</p>

  <p>"Isabella understands," commented Richard. "All sorts of rumours might fly
  around. I can't risk people saying I was entertaining a pretty lady in the
  tower-room, while my poor old uncle was passing out alone."</p>

  <p>"But Isabella's here," persisted Ann.</p>

  <p>"Isabella is such an old friend that she counts as family."</p>

  <p>Ann made a last effort.</p>

  <p>"The others will be coming to the reunion," she argued. "If I stay up
  here, I can explain what has happened and send them away."</p>

  <p>"Stephen is the only one who is likely to come," said Richard. "Give me
  your address and I'll ask him to get in touch with you."</p>

  <p>The request sounded reasonable but Ann was suspicious. Although all she
  wanted was to make contact with Stephen, she knew she could not trust any
  promise made by Richard. In spite of her simplicity, she got the impression
  that he and Isabella were playing the same game&mdash;and one without rules
  and referee. Something evil was being planned and the reunion was an
  unwelcome complication.</p>

  <p>She realised too that she had ruined her chance of remaining in the
  tower-room by letting Richard see her desperate eagerness. He and Stephen had
  always been antagonistic, so he would welcome a chance to score over a rival.
  Yet although he lauded deceit as a mental accomplishment and despised honesty
  as a brainless blundering instinct, he had betrayed himself to Ann by his two
  different voices. When he disguised his natural grating note with honied
  accents, he practically advertised the fact that he was telling a lie.</p>

  <p>Although her instinct was always to charge out into the open and take on
  more than her fighting weight, she knew that she must use guile, if she were
  to meet Stephen again. Even while she hated the necessity she plotted
  rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Pretend to go. Then slip back and wait in the downstair lobby. It's dark
  there."</p>

  <p>To her surprise she discovered that she was a natural liar as she looked
  at Richard with convincingly steady eyes.</p>

  <p>"I haven't an address," she told him. "I don't know how long I shall be at
  my hotel. Will you ask Stephen for his address. I'll ring you up to-morrow
  and get it. Good-night."</p>

  <p>"Yes, do please ring me up. Allow me."</p>

  <p>Isabella stood aloof while Richard helped Ann to put on her coat but her
  glance was scornful as she appraised the quality of the fur. Then to Ann's
  astonishment Richard drew from his pocket a creased white scarf. As he opened
  his light coat she noticed, for the first time, that he was wearing shabby
  evening-clothes.</p>

  <p>It was so unusual that he should dress for dinner, in the circumstances,
  that her suspicions flared up again. But she forgot them as she discovered
  the source of the perfume which she had connected with a death-chamber. In
  the buttonhole of Richard's coat was a crushed white hyacinth.</p>

  <p>He noticed her stare.</p>

  <p>"Picked it up from the greenhouse floor," he explained. "I'm going to see
  you off the premises. A zoo is not the safest place if you should lose your
  way in the black-out."</p>

  <p>"No," she protested. "I can follow the white stones. Your uncle might want
  you."</p>

  <p>"I'll risk him. He's taking his time about dying. But I might get into
  trouble with the coroner if I risked you."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Ann thought of Stephen&mdash;probably pressed for time and
  steering a correct course to Ganges by the stars. She remembered one occasion
  when they caught their last train back to London, only through his flair in
  finding a short-cut to the station.</p>

  <p>Fear for his safety made her confess that she had trespassed.</p>

  <p>"I wandered round before I reached the tower-room and I found myself by
  the elephant-house. I heard voices. I don't want to make mischief but one of
  them sounded drunk. I hope it wasn't a keeper."</p>

  <p>She missed the glance which flashed between Richard and Isabella.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Richard. "I must look into it. I've taken on a heavy
  responsibility...Come on, Ann. Back in a few minutes, Isabella."</p>

  <p>Guided by Richard's fingers around her elbow&mdash;and eager to get rid of
  her escort&mdash;Ann ran down the spiral stair. Directly the tower door was
  closed behind them she stopped with a cry of dismay.</p>

  <p>"It's like the catacombs," she said. "Stop while I get out my torch."</p>

  <p>Richard laughed as he took her arm and dragged her on.</p>

  <p>"You won't need a torch with me," he told her. "I can see in the dark.
  Besides I know my way about blindfolded...Just trust yourself to me."</p>

  <h3>VII.</h3>

  <p class="first">She wished he had not used the words which were spoken in
  his softest voice. They made her realise that she was deeply distrustful of
  her guide. She was completely at his mercy as she blundered along blindly,
  obeying the pressure of his arm.</p>

  <p>"I like the dark," he said. "It gives me a sense of power. I feel like the
  Invisible Man, because I can see others and they cannot see me. But it's a
  pity you are in partial eclipse, Ann. Of course, you know you've grown
  beautiful."</p>

  <p>His last words were spoken so tenderly that his voice might have been that
  of a romantic lover. Ann reflected what a shock it would be&mdash;after being
  wooed by Richard in the blackness&mdash;when his dark scored face was
  revealed in a beam of light.</p>

  <p>As he went on talking, she made a disturbing discovery. Although they had
  crossed the flagged courtyard, they were not walking over the beaten earth of
  the main path. Instead, her feet first crunched gravel and then stumbled over
  rough grass.</p>

  <p>"Where are you taking me?" she asked. "I know this is not the right
  way."</p>

  <p>"It's a short-cut," he replied. "You haven't been here before."</p>

  <p>His fingers tightened on her arm and he whispered in her ear.</p>

  <p>"Of course you noticed that Isabella was jealous as hell. You have made a
  great comeback. In future I'm going to see a lot of you. What do you say to
  that?"</p>

  <p>Feeling that some response was expected, Ann spoke without thought.</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking about something else, Richard. You were expecting us to meet
  here to-night. The door was open and the tower-room was lit. You made a
  register. So what made you change your mind about the reunion?"</p>

  <p>"Because, to quote Browning more or less, 'the net hath caught the fish.'
  I wanted the reunion to pull in one person only. <i>You.</i> Don't you know
  I've always been crazy about you? Now listen..."</p>

  <p>Although his face was touching hers, Ann did not shrink from him. All her
  attention was gripped by the threat of a new peril.</p>

  <p>The path which had been sloping downhill gradually, had become a steep
  incline. As the gradient grew sharper, she had somewhat the sensation of
  slipping down a chute. She was forced to quicken her pace to keep her
  footing, while every fresh step into the darkness seemed to be leading down
  to the mouth of a shaft. Soon she must run&mdash;run faster and ever
  faster&mdash;until her feet shot out into vacancy and she crashed down into
  blackness. A hideous suspicion flashing across her mind made her scream:</p>

  <p>"Stop, stop. You are taking me down to the bear-pit."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a little fool," cackled Richard. "I may pay a bear but I do my
  own hugging." His arm tightened around her as though to illustrate his words.
  "Now you must trust yourself entirely to me. We are coming to a steep flight
  of steps. Feel with your feet...That's right. I won't let you fall."</p>

  <p>As she was bumped down the treads of an invisible stone stair, Ann began
  to feel ashamed of herself. Her father's praise&mdash;"Not a nerve in her
  body"&mdash;reproached her with cowardice. She felt that even the grizzly was
  qualified to sneer at her, for allowing herself to be lugged about like a
  parcel.</p>

  <p>"I've made a complete fool of myself," she confessed when they reached
  level ground. "I felt so helpless, not being able to see."</p>

  <p>"I understand," Richard assured her suavely. "Besides, you took a bit of a
  jolt about Stephen. Too bad missing him...Now we are coming out on the
  road."</p>

  <p>Ann heard the clang of an iron gate closing behind them.</p>

  <p>"What luck," remarked Richard. "There's a bus coming in the right
  direction. Can you see its lights?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I can hear it coming."</p>

  <p>"Then it's 'Good-bye,'" His voice changed. "We won't kiss, my sweet.
  You've been putting on an excellent act but you didn't fool me. You made your
  mistake when you let me make love to you while you are all out for Stephen.
  Not like you, Ann, and most revealing. It told me all I wanted to
  know...Here's your Black Maria."</p>

  <p>He snapped on his torch for the first time, throwing its light down as he
  hailed the driver. As he helped Ann into the dim interior of the bus, he
  spoke in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Don't try to come back. You will find the tower door locked."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>III. &mdash; A SAGACIOUS BEAST</h2>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">AS Ann slumped down in her seat and watched the darkness
  flicker past the window, she was filled with the bitterness of defeat. In
  spite of obstacles, she had succeeded in getting inside the tower-room; but
  now she was outside again&mdash;back at her beginnings. To make matters
  worse, the situation had deteriorated, since there was no longer an open
  door.</p>

  <p>Yet when she remembered his warped nature, Richard's hostile attitude was
  not inexplicable. While he extracted unnatural pleasure from her
  disappointment, there was no reason for her to imagine a dark mystery. The
  inference was that the reunion had clashed with a more important date.</p>

  <p>"I'm meant to meet Stephen," she told herself, "or I wouldn't have got
  that eleventh-hour reservation in the plane. It's up to me to try again."</p>

  <p>She appealed to the conductor&mdash;no charming girl in grey and blue
  uniform&mdash;but a soured elderly man.</p>

  <p>"I want to get off at Ganges. How much?"</p>

  <p>"I took you on at Ganges," he objected.</p>

  <p>"But I want the main entrance. Please put me down there."</p>

  <p>The man punched a ticket, counted some coppers into her palm and then
  climbed to the upper-deck. Relieved of the responsibility of immediate
  action, Ann closed her lids. She got no relief&mdash;for sections of faces
  whirled before her eyes like the fragments of a bombed picture gallery;
  Richard, seamed and malignant&mdash;Isabella, in her debased
  beauty&mdash;John, a pathetic wreck. She saw them from every
  angle&mdash;profile, full-face and three-quarter&mdash;passing and
  repassing...</p>

  <p>When the conductor came down the stairs, he looked at her suspiciously
  over his spectacles.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you want Ganges?" he asked. "We've passed it. I stopped the bus
  for you."</p>

  <p>Ann remembered the tinkle of a bell, followed by a brief halt, but she had
  not connected the signal with herself. Instantly she was plunged into
  panic.</p>

  <p>"Stop the bus," she called.</p>

  <p>As she jumped from her seat a passenger disagreed with the conductor.</p>

  <p>"We haven't come to Ganges yet. Not the main gates. New to the route,
  aren't you, mate?"</p>

  <p>"Not so new as to want you to teach me my business. That was Ganges we
  passed."</p>

  <p>While the men argued Ann did not know which of them to believe. No one
  else in the bus appeared to have local knowledge, or sufficient interest to
  give a casting vote. All she knew was that while she awaited conviction the
  bus was rolling steadily back towards the tube terminus.</p>

  <p>"Put me out, please," she said to the conductor.</p>

  <p>Feeling that he had scored his point, the man rang the bell instantly and
  helped her down with a caution, "Mind how you cross, miss."</p>

  <p>There was no traffic and she reached the other side of the road in safety;
  but instead of the stone wall which encircled the grounds of Ganges, she saw
  a high bank, topped with fenced bushes and trees. They seemed proof that she
  had overshot her mark, so she turned and began to retrace her steps, in order
  to reach the main entrance gates.</p>

  <p>After a while she grew worried about the feeble gleam cast by her torch
  and doubtful about its battery. If it failed completely she knew that she had
  no chance of finding her way back to the tower-room. To conserve it, she
  snapped off the light and guided herself by touch, walking briskly and hoping
  to feel the gritty surface of stone, instead of sodden vegetation.</p>

  <p>It seemed to her that the bank stretched out endlessly. Brambles caught
  her fur sleeve, while her fingers grew cold and grimed from contact with
  docks, fallen leaves and snail-slimed ivy-trails. Presently the darkness made
  her grow nervous. It seemed strange that&mdash;after braving the dangers of
  savage places&mdash;she had come back to the safety of the English
  countryside to learn the meaning of fear. Yet even while she tried to
  concentrate on thoughts of Stephen she felt afraid.</p>

  <p>She found herself thinking of Hare and Burke, who used to spring on their
  victims from behind and press pitch-plasters over their mouths. It was a
  numbing sensation to reflect that&mdash;even then&mdash;someone might be
  following her. Richard might enjoy the thrill of stalking human quarry. At
  any moment, she might feel the grip of hands around her throat...</p>

  <p>She forgot her imaginary terrors at the sound of a clock striking in the
  distance. The three chimes told her that it was a quarter to nine. At the
  reminder that precious time was running to waste, the tower-room seemed very
  far away. It was possible that while she was following the course of the
  bank, Stephen had arrived at Ganges. He could come and go without meeting
  her. And they would never meet, for Richard and Isabella would assure him
  that she too had gone and left no address.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she realised that she was walking in the wrong direction. She had
  believed the conductor when he told her that they had passed Ganges, whereas
  the man who contradicted him had been right. Now that it was too late, she
  remembered that the main gates of the zoo were opposite William the Fourth.
  The inn was a recognised halt, so the bus would have stopped there as a
  matter of course, instead of merely slowing down at the tinkle of a bell.</p>

  <p>The inference was that she had got out at some intermediate point and was
  now skirting another part of the grounds&mdash;thus working back to the new
  short-cut, where she had parted from Richard. It maddened her to reflect
  that&mdash;instead of making progress&mdash;she was farther from her goal,
  since she had to cover the same ground twice. Although she was probably
  nearer to the steps, she dared not risk trying to reach the house by an
  unfamiliar route.</p>

  <p>Setting her lips she turned and guided herself back by the touch of her
  right hand sweeping the bank. As she ran she began to wonder what Stephen
  would do when he found that the door of the tower-room was locked, contrary
  to the promise of entry. She was positive that he would not come so far
  without making an effort to get inside. Probably he would ring at the front
  door in defiance of the secrecy rule.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for her to do the same, since Richard would warn the
  servants to turn her away. In any case, the question of admission involved a
  delicate problem if it were true that someone in the house was seriously ill.
  She remembered Richard's excitement when he mistook her for Isabella and how
  he had given her a bulletin "Must be dead by now." The inference was that he
  was speaking the truth and that his uncle was on his death-bed...</p>

  <p>Suddenly her fingertips scraped on stone. At last she had reached the wall
  which enclosed the humpy meadow. She followed its course until her hand
  touched an iron grille. After travelling in a wasteful circle, she was back
  at the main entrance of Ganges.</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">When she snapped on her torch she saw the stone elephants on
  the pillars and read the warning not to trespass. She was only too anxious to
  obey as she concentrated on tracking the whitened stones. While she
  alternately climbed uphill and dipped down into dells, she realised the
  maiming quality of the black-out on her faculties. In happier times the
  blazing windows of Ganges would have guided her as effectively as a
  lighthouse. Stumbling through the darkness she began to think of her letters
  to Stephen. After her failure to obtain his address, she continued to write
  to him, so as not to break the link. Those love-letters&mdash;which would
  have made Juliet turn in her vault&mdash;were a form of diary, recording
  daily events, the weather and even meals. Yet each contained one assurance to
  justify it. "I love you." "I love you more every day." "I shall love you to
  the end of my life."</p>

  <p>She posted them in various ways. She shredded the paper and let the wind
  whirl away the scraps. She watched them shrivel to ash in the heart of a
  bonfire. She sent them spinning down the current of a river...But always she
  had a confused conviction that although Stephen could not receive
  them&mdash;somehow&mdash;they must carry her love to him.</p>

  <p>She felt ashamed of her folly, even while she tried to justify it.</p>

  <p>"Actually childish. But there must be something in absent treatment. I'm
  sure he <i>knows.</i> So he will come to-night."</p>

  <p>She was straining her eyes to pick up the nebulous path when she heard
  footsteps in the distance. Her first panic instinct&mdash;to snap off her
  fight and run away into the darkness&mdash;was followed by the reminder that
  she had had one experience of being lost in the grounds of a zoo and did not
  wish to repeat it. While she stood listening she saw a glow-worm gleam
  bobbing about, apparently up in the sky. As the person grew nearer, he was
  evidently coming downhill, for as the ray dropped lower, it grew stronger.
  Then a sudden glare thrown upon her face made her blink.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" asked a voice, whose resonant gong-like quality
  made Ann understand how sound can shatter matter.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to find my way up to the house," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Coming to see me?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know who you are."</p>

  <p>"My name's Watson. This is my place. I own the zoo."</p>

  <p>Ann had always pictured Big Ben as a giant, whereas he appeared to be
  under average height. She realised then that it was his voice which had
  gained him the title of the famous Westminster clock. She also reflected that
  it was not surprising he was so long over dying, since he took time off for
  evening strolls.</p>

  <p>Necessity made her an opportunist. She knew that if she could make a good
  impression on Sir Benjamin, he could grant her entry into Ganges.</p>

  <p>"I've heard the zoo is wonderful," she said. "I've never seen it although
  I've been here before. I used to know your nephew Richard at college. My name
  is Ann Sherborne."</p>

  <p>"Sherborne. Any relation to the engineer?"</p>

  <p>"My father."</p>

  <p>"That so? I used to know him when we were much younger. We called him
  'Manuscript,' because of his initials&mdash;M.S.S. I forget what they stood
  for."</p>

  <p>"Mark Scudamore Sherborne," replied Ann, who knew perfectly well that he
  was testing her claim. "He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off as the roar of a lion suddenly shattered the silence.</p>

  <p>"Startled you?" asked Sir Benjamin.</p>

  <p>"It shouldn't," she replied. "I got used to hearing them in Africa. And
  there were no bars there between us."</p>

  <p>"Ever shot a lion?"</p>

  <p>Ann knew instinctively that it was another test-question and she was
  afraid that she would fail to qualify for admission to Ganges. It seemed
  probable that Sir Benjamin had been a big-game hunter in his time, since
  humanitarianism was so often allied with sport.</p>

  <p>"Only with a camera," she confessed. "The modern way. Does it sound
  terribly feeble to you?"</p>

  <p>To her surprise, Sir Benjamin held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to Ganges," he said. "I'm pleasantly surprised to find that
  Richard has such a charming friend. Sherborne's girl, too. I've people to
  dinner. Neighbours. Sorry the meal is over. But I propose to steal you from
  Richard for the rest of the evening. What about it?"</p>

  <p>Ann could hardly believe in her good fortune. Instead of having to sneak
  inside Ganges, she was going in the dignity of an invited guest, with its
  owner to escort her. As he threw the light of his torch on the path before
  her, he talked about his zoo.</p>

  <p>"Wild animals have always been a passion with me. I ran away from Eton to
  join a travelling circus. I was officially lost for four years. Explains why
  I've got no education. But I was always sick at heart because these
  beautiful, graceful wild creatures get such a raw deal. Free or caged,
  they're up against the cruelty of Nature or man. So I had a dream of
  collecting a limited number under as nearly perfect conditions as I could
  contrive."</p>

  <p>"You are lucky to make a dream come true," said Ann. "Is it a fact that
  you take lions about on leads, like dogs?"</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul, yes." Sir Benjamin began to chuckle. "I gave one of my
  guests a scare this evening. My favourite leopardess&mdash;Delia&mdash;has a
  cold, so I have her with me in the library for most of the day. Keep her from
  getting bored, you know. My beautiful lady resented being taken back to her
  own house and she told me what she thought of me when we were crossing the
  hall. I heard one of the fool women in the drawing-room let out a scream. I
  must pull her leg about it."</p>

  <p>Ann smiled as she noticed his distinction between a lady and a
  woman...This then, was the explanation of the snarl which had shaken the air
  inside the tower-room.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," said Sir Benjamin. "Welcome to Ganges."</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">As she mounted the steps Ann got an impression of a stately
  terraced mansion with a pillared portico. Directly she was inside the door
  she looked at her host. He was spare and slender with a scar on one cheek, as
  though one of his "beautiful ladies" had slapped him in the face. His mouth
  was bitter although his brown eyes were mournful and even tender. Like his
  nephew, his face was a map of lines, but in his case it was no
  enemy-territory. She noticed also that he too wore disreputable dinner
  clothes.</p>

  <p>Then she reminded herself that she was there only to wait for Stephen in
  the tower-room. For that reason it was necessary to make herself familiar
  with the house. Looking around her she noticed that the hall was unusually
  large and paved with black and white marble squares. There were enormous pots
  of pink azaleas as ornament but the temperature was that of an ice-house
  rather than a conservatory.</p>

  <p>What interested her most was the fine staircase which swept around up to a
  broad gallery. She was wondering how to locate the door which connected the
  house with the tower, when Sir Benjamin raised his astounding voice.</p>

  <p>"Richard," he boomed. "Come down here. I've a surprise for you."</p>

  <p>Richard appeared on the landing and leaned over the rail to look down into
  the hall. When he saw Ann he recoiled a pace as though in momentary doubt.
  With acute anxiety she watched him walk slowly down the stairs. If he
  declared that she was an adventuress Sir Benjamin would naturally believe his
  nephew's story.</p>

  <p>She went to meet him boldly, her hand outstretched.</p>

  <p>"Richard," she cried. "Are you surprised to see me&mdash;again?"</p>

  <p>His face showed no sign of recognition</p>

  <p>"You are making a mistake," he said. "I've never seen you before."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps John and Isabella can refresh your memory."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you know the names of my friends. But&mdash;do I know you?"</p>

  <p>Ann felt her face burn as Sir Benjamin looked at her keenly. Her heart
  hammered while she awaited his judgment.</p>

  <p>"If this is your idea of humour, Richard," he said, "we are not amused. If
  Miss Sherborne did not know you, she would not be here...Now I want you to go
  to the lion-house and get the latest bulletin on Delia."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>Richard obeyed as meekly as a lower school boy in the presence of his
  Head.</p>

  <p>When he had gone Ann inspected her grimy hands with an ostentatious
  sigh.</p>

  <p>"I seem to have collected the black-out," she said. "May I go upstairs to
  wash? Don't trouble to call a maid. I'll find the way."</p>

  <p>She was moving briskly towards the staircase when she was recalled by Sir
  Benjamin's voice.</p>

  <p>"You need not go up. Here's a cloakroom."</p>

  <p>To her disappointment he opened a door and switched on the light in a
  large modern lavatory, walled with primrose tiles. When she was inside, she
  grimaced at her reflection in the mirror.</p>

  <p>"Every luxury. I might be one of his civilised lions."</p>

  <p>It was some consolation to splash in hot water and to comb out the loose
  wave of her dark hair. Her complexion was tanned as brown as a California
  surf bather and needed no powder. Shy hung up her fur coat, applied scarlet
  lipstick and went out into the hall.</p>

  <p>Her hope of another chance to steal upstairs was frustrated by the sight
  of Sir Benjamin waiting outside the door.</p>

  <p>"Fresh as paint," he said approvingly. "As you have noticed, I'm
  unconventional. Say what I like&mdash;do what I like&mdash;know what I like.
  And I like you&mdash;because you are civilised as well as charming. Come and
  meet my guests."</p>

  <p>He slipped his arm through hers as they crossed the glacial hall.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. John Cumberland is here," he explained. "She's a lovely. And her
  husband should be around somewhere. Then there are my
  neighbours&mdash;Professor and Mrs. Blake and Sir Oswald and Lady Peacock.
  Peacock manufactures cosmetics, but his factories are turned over to war
  production...Now what do you think of my drawing-room?"</p>

  <p>Ann gazed around her in amazement. The vast apartment did not look like
  the room of a man whose pets were lions. It was cold and brittle, without
  solid furniture or padded comfort. The walls were white, decorated with
  panels of dark-blue watered silk. The carpet too was white and the gilded
  suite upholstered in blue brocade. There was also a gilded cabinet and
  numerous mirrors in gilt frames.</p>

  <p>"Like it?" asked Sir Benjamin eagerly. "I chose the scheme myself. Know
  how? I gave the firm a tea-cup and said, 'Match that.'...Come and meet the
  folks."</p>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">Still bewildered by the events of the evening and buffeted
  by repeated shocks&mdash;Ann vaguely expected to meet a collection of mild
  lunatics. It braced her nerves to discover that the guests&mdash;with one
  exception&mdash;conformed to pleasant conventional pattern. One couple
  appeared to be of such stressed that she identified them as Professor and
  Mrs. Blake, man was tall, thin and elderly, with hollow cheeks, a domed
  forehead and austere lips. His voice was frigid&mdash;his manner formal. His
  lady had severely dressed silver hair and chilly blue eyes shielded by
  pince-nez. She wore an obviously expensive black evening-gown, partially
  covered by a fur cape.</p>

  <p>In contrast with them the younger couple seemed to possess ultra warmth
  and colour. The husband was big, burly and genial, with a red clean-shaven
  face, polished black hair and horn-rimmed glasses. His wife was pretty, vivid
  and artificial. Her hair had been red and was red still; but in spite of dye
  and reckless rouge, her dark eyes sparkled with such friendly interest that
  Ann felt a mutual attraction.</p>

  <p>It was rather a jolt to her preconceived ideas when the introduction
  established the academic couple as Sir Oswald and Lady Peacock&mdash;the
  cosmetic manufacturer and his wife. Then Sir Benjamin turned to the
  professor's lively wife and pinched her chin.</p>

  <p>"Kitty," he said, "I want you to look after my best girl."</p>

  <p>"Another?" asked Mrs. Blake.</p>

  <p>He beamed like a schoolboy as he joined the men.</p>

  <p>"It's worth being cheap to make Big Ben grin," remarked Mrs. Blake. "Those
  sad eyes of his...Will you have coffee or a drink?"</p>

  <p>Feeling that&mdash;later&mdash;she might need the aid of stimulant, Ann
  chose gin and lime. While she was drinking it, her acting-hostess spoke
  passionately.</p>

  <p>"I envy you above all women."</p>

  <p>For a whirling second Ann thought that Mrs. Blake must have news for her
  from Stephen.</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Because you are wearing a suit."</p>

  <p>For the first time Ann noticed that Mrs. Blake had hung a matching coat
  over her green dinner-frock.</p>

  <p>"One has to look like a bundle of clothes in these icy rooms," complained
  the professor's wife. "Most of the coal goes in central-heating for the
  animals. I often wish Big Ben would throw his parties in the lions' cage.
  Have you seen the zoo?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"It's marvellous. Big Ben has spent a fortune on it and then some. The
  lions' den is made out of the ravine. Of course, there are sun-houses and
  out-door cages in front, but at the back there are entrances to caves and
  passages cut in the earth and leading down to the ravine. There's a railing
  around it, but you can see the lions prowling about at the bottom."</p>

  <p>She stopped to laugh.</p>

  <p>"The joke is, the beasts are so sophisticated that they want to see the
  public instead of reverting to the quiet of their natural state."</p>

  <p>As she listened to the chatter it seemed to Ann that the eerie element was
  draining out of the situation.</p>

  <p>"Are you nervous of coming here?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Heavens, no. I'm used to the animals. Big Ben consults me on delicate
  nursery matters, as I have a young family. I've sat up at night nursing cubs.
  That's a real sacrifice for a woman of my age to make. When I'm blear-eyed, I
  have to breakfast opposite a husband who's full of beans and the dangerous
  age."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you have breakfast in bed?"</p>

  <p>"Because that man of mine couldn't even chop off the top of his egg."</p>

  <p>Ann smiled at Kitty as she wondered wistfully whether she would ever meet
  Stephen early, in conjunction with boiled eggs...When she gazed around her
  she could hardly believe that the scene was real. She had had occasional dips
  back into civilisation&mdash;between contracts&mdash;but this was her first
  experience of social life. Sir Oswald and Lady Peacock reassured her as they
  made the usual remarks about the usual things in impersonal well-bred voices.
  She was further entertained by Lady Peacock's determination to get the chair
  nearest the fire, in a ladylike and legitimate manner. She strolled
  about&mdash;chatting while she sipped her coffee&mdash;while she regulated
  her progress so that she drained her cup in time to place it on the marble
  mantelpiece. After that her next move, naturally, was to sink into the
  coveted chair.</p>

  <p>Ann watched the comedy while she listened to Mrs. Blake's confidences.</p>

  <p>"My real name is 'Susannah,' but my husband calls me 'Kitty.' People seem
  to expect something silly from me. They think I've been on the stage. That's
  my meretricious hair. You can't get a natural red dye...As a matter of fact,
  I trained to be a teacher and I was the professor's star pupil. He always
  makes me vet his stuff before he lectures. If I can spot a bloomer he stands
  me a Guinness."</p>

  <p>Ann's attention had begun to wander. She was trying to think of some way
  to get back into the tower-room, when Mrs. Blake lowered her voice.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see anything so debased as Big Ben's dinner-jacket?
  Richard's is the same. Those men look as if they slept in the stables. It's
  because they're always popping off to the animal-houses. I'm sorry for my
  poor dear Richard."</p>

  <p>"You can't <i>like</i> him?" gasped Ann.</p>

  <p>"Well, he might consider that a liberty. But he has a charming voice and
  my husband considers him clever. He's good to the animals. He's always
  lamenting there are no Christians on the market for him to feed to the lions.
  I believe he means it. He can't help having a face like my crocodile-skin
  shoes...Here comes my rival."</p>

  <p>Ann's mouth hardened and her eyes grew older than her years as Isabella
  came into the drawing-room. She looked beautiful as a golden butterfly,
  spreading her wings in the sunshine while her companions remained in the
  chrysalis stage. The effect was contrived by the fact that she wore no
  concealing wrap over her low-cut silver lamé gown.</p>

  <p>"That woman can't be human," whispered Kitty wrathfully. "She could stand
  in an ice-pail and drink a quart of champagne, without getting a red nose.
  Now just watch her pull in the men."</p>

  <p>Isabella crossed to Sir Benjamin, flung one bare arm around his neck and
  kissed him.</p>

  <p>"Hallo, darling," she said.</p>

  <p>Within a few seconds Sir Oswald and the professor had joined the pair.</p>

  <p>"She's got the Circe touch," muttered Kitty. "I hate to see my husband
  talking to her. I always think of swine...And I promised to honour the
  man."</p>

  <p>"What about her husband?" asked Ann, as she thought of the homely girl who
  was listed as John's salvation.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely lost. He's got her in his hair."</p>

  <p>Ann noticed the fatuous look on Sir Benjamin's face as Isabella laid her
  cool scented cheek against his. Looking over his shoulder at the
  women&mdash;with insolent lack of interest&mdash;she saw Ann. From her start
  it was evident that Richard had not been able to prepare her for the shock of
  meeting the extra guest&mdash;although her recovery was swift.</p>

  <p>"Is it actually Ann?" she drawled.</p>

  <p>Sir Benjamin threw his arm around her as he led her to Ann.</p>

  <p>"Miss Sherborne, meet my best girl," he said.</p>

  <p>"The only occasion I can think of, when the comparative outclasses the
  superlative, is when a best girl meets a better woman," said Kitty
  sweetly.</p>

  <p>Her remark spurred Ann to accept the challenge. She knew that she was in a
  dangerous position, since Isabella possessed the personal influence over Sir
  Benjamin which Richard lacked.</p>

  <p>"She'll think up something and I'll be thrown out on my ear," she told
  herself. "I've got to move fast."</p>

  <p>While Isabella was still glaring at Kitty Blake the professor tried to
  distract her with a question.</p>

  <p>"Where's your big husband?"</p>

  <p>"Big?" repeated Sir Benjamin scornfully. "That's a ridiculous claim for
  any human. But if you want to know how small John is, just pop him in my
  elephant-house."</p>

  <p>Ann alone saw the change which swept over Isabella's face. A flicker of
  real emotion chased away the wanton gleam in her eyes. For a
  moment&mdash;before her expression was veiled again with
  nonchalance&mdash;she looked starkly afraid.</p>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">Although Ann was conscious of an unwelcome impression, she
  had no time for speculation. She knew that she must take a chance; and while
  she dared not entrust so talkative a lady with the secret of the tower-room,
  she turned impulsively to Kitty.</p>

  <p>"May I be terribly unconventional?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Do," urged Mrs. Blake. "I hate people who talk like timetables."</p>

  <p>"I want to go upstairs."</p>

  <p>"There's a cloakroom&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know. But I want a bedroom. I'm not going to steal bags. I want
  to&mdash;to meet someone."</p>

  <p>"In a bedroom? Sounds promising. Of course, I'll help&mdash;and I'm asking
  no questions. Here I go."</p>

  <p>Ann was filled with gratitude, even while she was amazed at Mrs. Blake's
  indiscretion. Although the professor's wife knew nothing of her private life
  or character, she slipped her bag between the loose cushions of her chair
  before she raised her voice in a general appeal.</p>

  <p>"I've left my bag in the bedroom. Who wants to fetch it?"</p>

  <p>As Ann jumped up, resolved to be first away and outdistance the field,
  Kitty reassured her in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. None of the men are going to hear me so long as they have
  the use of their ears."</p>

  <p>That she knew her company was evident when Sir Oswald dutifully joined his
  wife by the fire, while the other men broke into loud laughter as a tribute
  to Isabella's wit. Taking advantage of their distracted attention Ann stole
  across the room and slipped into the hall. Fearing every moment that Isabella
  would guess her purpose and follow her, she rushed up the stairs and reached
  the corridor.</p>

  <p>She felt cheap as the meanest hotel-thief as she cautiously opened door
  after door, only to see empty bedrooms or bathrooms. When she heard a sound
  of footsteps coming down a branching passage her nerves began to flutter in a
  demoralising manner. She feared that Richard had returned from the
  lion-house, so it was a relief to see a housemaid whose extreme youth
  reflected the war-time shortage of domestic labour.</p>

  <p>She challenged Ann with her suspicious stare and Ann looked at her
  defensively. Each waited for the other to speak before Ann blurted out an
  explanation of her presence.</p>

  <p>"Which is the room where the ladies took off their coats? One of them
  wants her bag."</p>

  <p>Without a word the girl opened a door and jerked her thumb in the
  direction of a bed on which a fur coat had been thrown.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," muttered Ann. "Oh, by the way, is any one ill in the house?"</p>

  <p>"Not as I know of," replied the girl. "But I've got the headache chronic.
  Smoking makes it better but I've no fags."</p>

  <p>"What about mine," said Ann, acknowledging the touch. "Take several while
  you are about it." As she opened her case, she asked a casual question,
  "Which is the way to the tower-room?"</p>

  <p>"You mean Richard's room?" corrected the girl, grinning for the first
  time. "Down there."</p>

  <p>She pointed to an insignificant door which Ann had passed by in the belief
  that it was a housemaids' cupboard. As she pocketed her cigarettes she
  remarked in a meaning voice, "I've just shown a gentleman up there."</p>

  <p>"A gentleman?" echoed Ann.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman," said the girl. "From the front door. He had fallen down and
  got all mucky, but he spoke like a gentleman and he gave me half a
  crown."</p>

  <p>Ann's hopes soared as she hurried down a narrow passage and opened the
  door at its end. It led out to the top landing of the tower. Below her was
  the shaft of the circular stair. Light still streamed from the tower-room and
  she heard some one moving about inside.</p>

  <p>"Stephen," she cried.</p>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">It was not Stephen who rose from the chair, but a youngish
  man of dishevelled appearance. He was stout, very pale, and in a distressed
  state; he blew through his lips and his eyes appeared dazed behind his thick
  glasses. But in spite of dusty clothes and the wisp of hay which clung to his
  trousers, he managed to suggest a pompous and even a professional man.</p>

  <p>"Is it James?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I hope it is," replied the man in a blurred voice which ill-matched his
  precise phrasing. "I am beginning to doubt my identity. However&mdash;that is
  a digression. I have just been looking at the register and your signature has
  given me a clue regarding yourself. You must be Ann."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He shook her hand formally with cold limp fingers.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to meet you again," he said. "I should not have recognised you.
  So you too remembered the date of our reunion?"</p>

  <p>He removed his glasses and began to polish their lenses with a soiled
  handkerchief. She noticed that his hands were shaking but he preserved his
  surface calm.</p>

  <p>"It has often amused me to recall our sessions," he remarked. "We talked
  amazing nonsense. Sheer adolescent folly. You were the only silent member.
  Was it ignorance or wisdom?"</p>

  <p>"Admiration," Ann told him. "I thought you were all wonderful. Sometimes I
  knew when any one slipped up. Victoria got the symptoms of cirrhosis of the
  liver wrong. I nursed someone who had it, so I knew."</p>

  <p>"Yet you did not correct her. Admirable restraint. What have you done
  during these past seven years?"</p>

  <p>For the first time Ann appreciated the nebulous James as he listened with
  apparent interest to the story of her travels. He asked intelligent questions
  and was sympathetic when he heard of her father's death. Suddenly, however,
  she could restrain her curiosity no longer.</p>

  <p>"Have you had an accident?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Hardly an accident," he replied. "I've had an amazing and very unpleasant
  experience. I'm still in such a state of mental confusion that I hardly know
  how to regard it. Either I've been the victim of a criminal practical joke,
  or there's been a deliberate attempt on my life."</p>

  <p>"Why should any one want to kill you?" asked Ann. "Have you enemies?"</p>

  <p>"None to my knowledge. I'm quiet and set in my habits. And I am most
  abstemious. I must beg you to believe that."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you are...What happened?"</p>

  <p>"I was on my way to the reunion and picking up the trail of the whitened
  stones. My sight is not good, so I was relieved to meet Richard. He told me I
  had blundered off the path and as we were near a laboratory he invited me to
  come inside. I was interested in some of his slides. Then he offered me a
  drink and I accepted it. To my horror, my head began to swim and I felt
  myself going under. It is true I am not used to liquor, but its effect was so
  instantaneous that I am beginning to wonder whether I were drugged. At the
  time, however, I was so ashamed that I was glad to accept Richard's offer to
  sleep off the effects in an adjacent conservatory, where I could be warm. The
  rest is very blurred, but I know we reached the greenhouse because I remember
  the scent of forced flowers."</p>

  <p>Ann caught her lip between her teeth as she thought of the hyacinth which
  Richard had worn in his coat. A horrible suspicion flickered across her mind
  while she listened to James's pedantic voice.</p>

  <p>"I awoke to find myself lying upon straw in a stable&mdash;with an
  elephant's forefoot close to my head."</p>

  <p>He paused, awaiting her comment. As she remained silent he went on
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"From childhood I have been taught to regard the elephant as a sagacious
  beast. Like Providence he realises the helpless condition of children and
  drunks and he respects it. When they are present he treads around them so
  delicately that not a hair of their head is harmed...But&mdash;should a
  certain condition be present he would lose his self-control and plunge about
  in sheer terror."</p>

  <p>James stopped and mopped his brow.</p>

  <p>"That complication was introduced," he said. "Just before I lost
  consciousness I heard the elephant trumpet and begin to stamp, at the same
  moment as I felt a peculiar light movement under my spine...gave myself up
  for lost and commended my soul to God. When I awoke I was unhurt and the
  elephant was standing over me, like a statue, on guard. Then, when I picked
  up something which was lying underneath me, I realised that my life had been
  saved by my weight."</p>

  <p>James stooped to pick up his disreputable hat. He tried to brush it feebly
  while he looked at its condition with bewildered eyes.</p>

  <p>"Since then," he said, "I incline to the belief that the fiasco was a plot
  of devilish cunning. The combination of special circumstances was too grossly
  fortuitous not to be planned."</p>

  <p>"But <i>who</i> would want to kill you?" persisted Ann.</p>

  <p>"No one. Of course, the obvious suspect would be Richard. He met me in the
  grounds, gave me the fateful drink and led me to the greenhouse. But he could
  have no motive for killing me. We have not met for years. Our interests have
  never clashed. In the past our personal relations were tepid....suppose you
  haven't a clothes brush?"</p>

  <p>As he looked around him helplessly Ann came to his aid&mdash;putting his
  tie and collar straight and rubbing some of the mud from his suit with her
  handkerchief. She welcomed the occupation as a chance to hide her face when
  she asked a question.</p>

  <p>"Do you think Richard may be a criminal lunatic?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied James. "He is&mdash;and always has been coldly sane. Of
  course, he is not normal...Thank you, Ann. I feel rather less like a
  scarecrow. Now I must sign."</p>

  <p>He unclipped his fountain-pen and wrote upon the register in a small
  crabbed script&mdash;"James."</p>

  <p>"You are very brave to carry on after what happened," said Ann.</p>

  <p>"Habit," he explained. "Although I'm still young I am set in my ways. I
  always keep an engagement. If I had returned to the tube terminus I should
  not sleep to-night. I must finish whatever I begin. So here I am. I've
  signed. I've met you. And now I can go."</p>

  <p>"Won't you wait to see Richard? He may be able to explain."</p>

  <p>"His explanation would not satisfy me. He would say, 'My dear fellow, I
  left you sleeping in the greenhouse. I know nothing of the facts, but I
  conjecture that you wandered into the elephant-house. You were perfectly safe
  in there. The elephant is a sagacious beast and he respects drunken
  professors.'"</p>

  <p>James went to the door and then held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Ann," he said. "Now that we have met we must meet again."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to," she told him. "Oh, James, did you go first to the
  tower-door?"</p>

  <p>"I did," he replied, "but it was locked. It was contrary to the conditions
  of the reunion. In fact, so much has been different. Ann, won't you return
  with me? I can escort you to the gates and I will ring up for a taxi from the
  William the Fourth."</p>

  <p>Ann felt so shaken by his experience and so apprehensive of the future
  that she was tempted to accept his offer. The fact that Richard had locked
  the tower-door warned her that he was capable of raising other obstacles.
  Moreover, James had proved not only kind and sympathetic, but brave.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to come with you," she said. "But I've started something too. I
  want to meet the others."</p>

  <p>"Only two to come," commented James, glancing at the register. "I doubt if
  Dr. Pybus will make such a long journey."</p>

  <p>"But there's Stephen."</p>

  <p>"No. He is dead."</p>

  <h3>VII.</h3>

  <p class="first"><i>Dead</i>. Suddenly it seemed to Ann that the light went
  out, leaving her in a frozen darkness. She had the sensation of dropping into
  space, as though she were falling into a bottomless abyss, ringed with dead
  stars. Then her heart gave a violent leap and she regained her breath in a
  sob. She was back in the tower-room but even her brain felt numbed. It
  functioned only to remind her that any statement made by James used to be
  accepted by the others, because he never imparted information unless he was
  sure of his facts. Remembering this, it seemed hopeless to query the truth of
  his news.</p>

  <p>"When did he die?" she asked dully.</p>

  <p>"The sixteenth of last month," replied James. "He was killed in a car
  accident when he was on leave from the R.A.F. I read it in <i>The Times</i>
  and noticed the uncommon name&mdash;'Stephen Pardou.'"</p>

  <p>"But Stephen's name was 'Pardon.'"</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" James displayed interest. "You are telling me something I
  never knew before. Of course, we always used our Christian names because of
  their Royal flavour. I realise now that when he signed his name an 'n' could
  resemble a 'u.' It is not uncommon to slur the final letter...So I think we
  can conclude that the unfortunate man was not our special Stephen...Once
  again&mdash;Good-bye."</p>

  <p>Ann smiled faintly as she remarked that James was still too engrossed in
  his own condition to realise her distress. At the door he paused to draw from
  his pocket a small parcel, wrapped in some pages torn from his note-book.</p>

  <p>"Kindly give that to Richard," he said. "Tell him I thought it might
  interest him."</p>

  <p>When he had gone Ann undid the coverings, to reveal a small mouse which
  had been crushed to death.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>IV. &mdash; A LOST HAND</h2>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">FEELING limp as a jointed doll whose elastic has perished,
  Ann sank into a chair after James had gone. Her shaky legs and torpid brain
  reminded her somewhat of the after-effects of malaria. The false report of
  Stephen's death had reduced her to a condition of shock when she felt she was
  incapable of making an effort.</p>

  <p>"I can't stay up here much longer," she reminded herself. "They'll wonder
  where I am."</p>

  <p>Although she was too set in her purpose to pay homage to convention, she
  realised that she was in a delicate position. She had crashed her way into
  Ganges on false pretences. She knew instinctively that this was a house where
  two gongs sounded for meals&mdash;where dinner-jackets were the
  rule&mdash;and where distinctive family features and names were reproduced in
  every generation. No smoking-room story would be permitted in the chill blue
  and white drawing-room. Even if the professor and his lively wife possessed a
  more elastic code, when they were in Ganges they would conform to the
  standard set by Sir Oswald and Lady Peacock.</p>

  <p>She heard the door on the landing open but she did not stir. After
  repeated disappointment she was too discouraged to expect Stephen;
  but&mdash;when Richard entered&mdash;she shrank from him because this was
  their first meeting since he had repudiated her. Driven to the defence of
  attack, she asked the first question.</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten me&mdash;again?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her with a disagreeable smile.</p>

  <p>"No. Up here my memory functions. It was meeting you in the marble halls
  of my ancestors which upset its mechanism. As a matter of fact I expected to
  find you here. But what a lot of trouble you take for so little result."</p>

  <p>"Is it so little? I am <i>here</i>. That's something, isn't it? And I've
  met your uncle. That's something too. I'm glad he made such a quick recovery.
  You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off to stare at Richard. His attention was concentrated on the
  register which lay on the table. So rigid were his facial muscles that his
  features again appeared locked in a stiff vulpine mask. He pointed to the
  last entry with a shaking forefinger.</p>

  <p>"What's this?"</p>

  <p>"James's signature," Ann told him. "You must have missed him on the
  stairs. He's not gone long."</p>

  <p>"James? Here? Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I am. We had a talk."</p>

  <p>After a pause Richard asked another question.</p>

  <p>"How was he?"</p>

  <p>"In rather bad shape. He seemed to think he'd been Shanghaied and dumped
  in the elephant-house."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary delusion." Richard mopped his yellowed waxen forehead which
  glistened under the light. "This is what actually happened. I met him
  staggering about the grounds&mdash;drunk as a lord. I gave him a drink to
  pull him round, but he passed right out...So I lugged him to a hothouse to
  sleep it off. The snag is&mdash;I clean forgot all about him after that."</p>

  <p>"But how did he get inside the elephant-house?" asked Ann.</p>

  <p>"How can I tell? Blundered there in a dazed state, or imagined the whole
  thing. But he was quite safe. Jupiter's quiet as a lamb."</p>

  <p>The explanation appeared more rational to Ann than James's motiveless
  suspicions. It was only because she wanted to lay her own hideous fancies
  entirely that she persisted.</p>

  <p>"Elephants are terrified of mice, aren't they? There was one in the
  elephant-house. Luckily it ran under James and he rolled on it and killed it.
  He left it behind for you."</p>

  <p>Richard's face grew dark with anger as he unrolled the limp paper parcel.
  Taking the dead mouse by its tail he hurled it into a corner of the room.</p>

  <p>"What the hell does he mean by dumping his filthy salvage on me?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>When Ann remained silent he spoke to her persuasively:</p>

  <p>"You and I must come to some understanding, Ann. I don't want any clash of
  interests to-night. In confidence, some financial trouble has broken and I'm
  rather on the spot. I ought to have called the reunion off. But I was curious
  to know if any of you remembered the date&mdash;and also to meet <i>you</i>.
  And now I should like to hear your plans."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to stay up here until the last moment," said Ann.</p>

  <p>"In this room? I thought you were my uncle's guest. Do you owe him no
  courtesy?"</p>

  <p>"I've thought of that&mdash;and I've decided to tell him all about the
  reunion."</p>

  <p>Richard broke into a high neighing laugh.</p>

  <p>"Do that&mdash;and you'll find yourself politely put outside the front
  door. The old boy's a Puritan and a bit simple. He will ask <i>why</i> a
  bunch of strangers used to meet in his house, without his permission. He's a
  stickler for permission. Then I shall explain what we all had in common."</p>

  <p>"Our Royal names?"</p>

  <p>"No. The name of our society&mdash;'Seven Sullied Souls.' The word
  <i>'Sullied'</i> and all that it implies. Isabella and John will back me up.
  He'll think that we met to indulge in orgies."</p>

  <p>Ann frowned as she recalled her own reckless words to Kitty Blake. She had
  told the professor's wife that she wished to meet someone in a bedroom. She
  had been a fool to disregard convention after she had been warned. When she
  remembered the torchlight thrown upon her face as Sir Benjamin asked her the
  test-question about her father's name, it was plain that he was taking no
  chance of admitting some attractive but meretricious stranger.</p>

  <p>She dragged herself wearily up from her chair.</p>

  <p>"You win," she said to Richard. "I'm going back to the drawing-room."</p>

  <p>"I'll come with you," he offered. "You are so elusive&mdash;and I never
  take my eye off the ball at golf."</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Ann felt as though they were playing in the finale of a
  pantomime as they walked slowly, side by side, down the broad staircase. The
  expanse of marble flooring and the massed pink azaleas made the hall resemble
  a stage-setting. But the music and applause was missing&mdash;to hearten her
  after another check&mdash;as she entered the drawing-room with a sinking
  sense of failure.</p>

  <p>In her absence the guests were re-grouped. Posed on the rug before the
  fire, Isabella gazed into the flames, ignoring the professor's efforts to
  interest her. The remaining four were seated around a bridge table. Sir
  Benjamin partnered Lady Peacock while Sir Oswald played with Kitty Blake who
  was transformed by large horn-rimmed glasses. From her conversation, Ann had
  credited the professor's wife with a mosquito mind; but now her face was set
  in the agonised rigour of an Indian brave under torture, while she scooped up
  her tricks with the snap of a shark.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Blake looks grim," she remarked to Richard.</p>

  <p>"She makes rings round the rest of them," he explained.</p>

  <p>Absorbed in their game, the card players took no notice of Ann's re-entry;
  but Isabella sprang up from the rug and darted towards Richard in a swift and
  glittering streak, like a shooting-star. Taking his hand she pulled him
  across to the coolest part of the room&mdash;the huge window recess.
  Deserted&mdash;Ann was watching the two heads pressed together, when the
  professor spoke to her.</p>

  <p>"They look very secret," he remarked, glancing towards the bay. "Certainly
  no one is likely to disturb their Arctic idyll. Suppose we go back to the
  fire?"</p>

  <p>In other circumstances Ann would have enjoyed the professor's
  conversation. Although he had an excellent brain he confined himself to
  gossip which sounded indiscreet but betrayed no actual confidence. Presently
  he mentioned their host.</p>

  <p>"Big Ben is a grand character. Of course, his zoo may be the result of
  arrested development. He's had no education. His passion for felines is
  rather uncomfortable. Reminds me of that French classic short
  story&mdash;<i>Passion in the Desert</i>. Big Ben cried over its end...In
  fact, the whole situation distresses us because of the danger to him. If the
  zoo should be closed, I doubt if he would survive. Either the shock will kill
  him or he'll commit suicide."</p>

  <p>"Is there any danger of its being closed?" asked Ann.</p>

  <p>"A very grave one. There is strong local prejudice against it, especially
  since the blitz, although no bombs have been dropped here. Lately there have
  been public meetings to protest against the renewal of his licence. The
  trouble is, there have been accidents at the zoo. To start with a lion
  escaped and killed a sheep before Sir Benjamin led it away on a lead."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Ann recalled the conversation in the bus.</p>

  <p>"What happened to a boy called Perce?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Percy Marshall? He climbed an enclosure and got a very mild
  electric-shock from a live wire which is there to protect the animals from
  interference. He developed mild St. Vitus' Dance which yielded to treatment
  directly after Big Ben had stumped up handsomely. But he is conscientious and
  still shakes in public, to show that he is earning his money."</p>

  <p>Ann looked across to the bridge table. As dummy, Sir Benjamin was
  apparently engrossed in watching the play of the hand; but whenever he stared
  into vacancy, his eyes looked haunted by the threat of loss. While she could
  not decide whether he was a menace to the community or a victim of prejudice,
  she was sure of two facts; she liked him and she felt deep compassion for
  him.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it is a racket to get money from Sir Benjamin?" she asked.
  "People know he is rich and will pay up to avoid trouble. It may be a form of
  blackmail."</p>

  <p>"No," said the professor. "The last accident was really nasty. An employee
  got his hand mauled by a lion and it had to be amputated. I doubt if any one
  would sacrifice his hand for less than a fortune...Just look over to the
  window."</p>

  <p>An expression of amused curiosity on his big red face, the professor
  nodded towards Isabella and Richard.</p>

  <p>"Suggests <i>Faust,</i>" he remarked. "Mephistopheles trying to corrupt
  Marguerite. Unfortunately the lady is too beautiful to be described as
  sea-green."</p>

  <p>Ann stared at the pair who were too engrossed to notice her interest.
  Richard's face was Satanic as he whispered into Isabella's ear. That his
  suggestion was monstrous was evident from the horror in her eyes. She
  appeared to protest vehemently while he continued to press his demand.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what's the nature of the proposal," murmured the professor. "It
  must be something fairly strong to arouse the lady's opposition. It cannot be
  an assault on her innocence&mdash;for she boasts that she has none. And I
  should not credit her with many scruples."</p>

  <p>As they watched the duel, Ann noticed that Isabella's lips were growing
  slack and her eyes were blurring, in token of surrender.</p>

  <p>"She's weakening," remarked the professor. "That fellow has a sort of
  snakelike fascination. My wife's a clever woman, but she looks a complete
  fool when he coos into her ear. I always want to take a running kick at
  him."</p>

  <p>Ann remembered Kitty's remark about Isabella's effect on her husband as
  the professor went on talking.</p>

  <p>"Richard is handicapped by his appearance. He looks too complete a villain
  to be successful in the part. He'd be the obvious suspect. It would be a more
  interesting proposition if Sir Oswald were the sinister master-mind. Hasn't
  he a fine head?"</p>

  <p>Ann looked at Sir Oswald's silver hair and clear-cut
  features&mdash;blocked against a dark-blue panel&mdash;rather after the
  fashion of a transposed silhouette. Hitherto, she had seen his profile
  against the white walls, which had nibbled away its outline.</p>

  <p>Yet even as she murmured agreement she wondered whether the professor's
  geniality would be a more effective disguise for a dark purpose.</p>

  <p>"Richard and Isabella seem close friends," she remarked. "What does John
  think about it?"</p>

  <p>"You are meant to believe he notices nothing," replied the professor. "Of
  course, he must know that his wife is exclusively interested in Richard. She
  makes no secret of it. Her kind of woman is a law to herself. But every one
  regards Richard as invulnerable to women. That turns the drama to a dialogue
  play without action."</p>

  <p>"If she feels like that about Richard, she shouldn't have married John,"
  declared Ann. "There's a telephone ringing. I do wish someone would answer
  it."</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">A minute later another very youthful maid&mdash;whose curls
  and musical-comedy apron marked her as different rank from the
  housemaid&mdash;shouted a message from the open door.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gold wants you on the phone, sir."</p>

  <p>Apparently the name had significance for others besides Sir Benjamin. He
  threw down his cards and hurried from the room while Richard and Isabella
  watched him with robot faces. The bridge-players took the opportunity to
  relax from an uneven game. Lady Peacock had been losing steadily, through her
  partner's blunders, but without loss of composure. She refused to make any
  comment when Kitty Blake burst into impulsive sympathy.</p>

  <p>"Big Ben's play was criminal. I felt a sweep to take advantage of it. But
  I'm like old Sarah Battle&mdash;I <i>must</i> play the game. I expect he is
  worried stiff about his licence. These cowardly attacks on him make me
  boil."</p>

  <p>"I can't agree with you," remarked Sir Oswald. "I've been frank and open
  with him. I've told him I consider the Zoo is unpatriotic self-indulgence.
  The cost of upkeep must be stupendous. No wonder his nephew looks worried if
  he has to maintain all this extravagant expenditure after his uncle's
  death."</p>

  <p>"He's not dead yet," Kitty reminded him. "And it's his own money. If he
  plunged on the stock exchange, or ran a pretty lady, no one would bat an
  eyelid. All this ill-feeling is because he loves animals rather unwisely and
  too well."</p>

  <p>Lady Peacock's smile was superior as she patted Kitty's arm.</p>

  <p>"You're talking like a sentimental schoolgirl," she said. "Think of all
  that new land Sir Benjamin has just bought. It may be too barren and rough
  for cultivation, but my husband would erect factories on it, to increase the
  national effort."</p>

  <p>"He just beat me to it," confided Sir Oswald. "Frankly, I admit that I
  didn't realise the value of the land, in time. I've had it out with him. I've
  told him that if he will re-sell&mdash;at a reasonable profit to
  himself&mdash;I will withdraw all my opposition to the Zoo."</p>

  <p>To demonstrate his frankness&mdash;which Ann was beginning to recognise as
  his long suit&mdash;he did not lower his voice as his host returned. Sir
  Benjamin was flushed and excited from good news.</p>

  <p>"Just fixed up the extensions," he told them, almost shouting in his
  triumph. "Gold's just given me a final estimate which is in line with my
  figure. I sign on the dotted line tomorrow&mdash;and then it will be full
  speed ahead."</p>

  <p>"Is that wise, Watson?" asked Sir Oswald. "You are not too secure. Another
  accident would put you in the soup. Frankly, you've had your last warning
  from the council."</p>

  <p>The defiance in Sir Benjamin's eyes was a challenge to Fate.</p>

  <p>"There will be no more accidents," he said. "In future, no outsider will
  be admitted to the Zoo."</p>

  <p>Ann&mdash;who was watching Isabella and Richard&mdash;received the
  impression of a sudden violent repercussion to the verdict. It happened so
  swiftly that she wondered whether had imagined it; yet it seemed to her that
  Richard used force to push Isabella forward&mdash;as though he were freeing
  some evil agency, disguised with fatal beauty&mdash;which was projected
  against its own volition. Isabella's movements were so mechanical and her
  eyes so devoid of spirit, that she might have been the dried sheath of a
  lovely woman as she sat on the arm of Sir Benjamin's chair.</p>

  <p>"You mean the public, don't you, darling?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No, Isabella," replied Sir Benjamin, "the rule applies to my friends. I
  can't risk these beautiful creatures being sacrificed by some clumsy
  fool."</p>

  <p>Taking his face between her hands, she forced him to look at her. "I love
  them too," she whispered. "And they love me. You <i>know</i>."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're a witch." Glancing around, Sir Benjamin singled out Ann to
  receive his tribute to Isabella's courage. "Isabella goes into the lions'
  cage and strokes them. Of course, they are tame as kittens, but if she showed
  the least sign of fear, they would resent it and then they would resent her.
  When they're nervous they could be dangerous."</p>

  <p>As Ann listened, she began to agree with Kitty that Isabella must possess
  a freak circulation. Just as her blood seemed unable to register temperature,
  so her nerves were immune to the formic-acid of fear.</p>

  <p>"I must wish them 'Good-bye,'" persisted Isabella. "Let us all go
  together. For the last time. Promise."</p>

  <p>Ann did not understand her own terror at the prospect of a visit to the
  lion-house. The animals were reputed to be tame and were safely caged, while
  Sir Benjamin would be in control. Yet she could not shed her latent dread of
  treachery as she realised the lethal possibilities of the Zoo. John had first
  stirred her imagination and later, James had infected her with his suspicions
  of a monstrous plot.</p>

  <p>She saw the fatal signs of weakness on Sir Benjamin's face. Then&mdash;to
  her relief&mdash;he pushed Isabella away roughly and almost shouted his
  refusal. "<i>No</i>."</p>

  <p>Isabella accepted the rebuff with nonchalance.</p>

  <p>"I really believe he means it," she said with a shrug. "Well, I've done my
  best."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, my dear, you can do better than that," remarked Richard.</p>

  <p>Rebellion flickered in Isabella's eyes, but before she could speak, the
  juvenile parlour-maid appeared at the door.</p>

  <p>"The doctor's here, sir," she said. "In the hall."</p>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">But Dr. Hogarth was already striding into the drawing-room.
  He seemed to have discovered the secret of perpetual motion, for Ann never
  saw him entirely still. Even when he was sitting down, his face worked and he
  snapped his fingers.</p>

  <p>Slightly underhung, his jutting jaw combined with dark eager eyes to
  create an impression of youthful vigour. He wore the uniform of the
  R.A.M.C.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to see you, Watson," he said, gripping Sir Benjamin's hand and
  shaking back a red cowlick of persistent tendency. "You must forgive me
  thrusting in among your guests, but it's intentional. The larger audience I
  have for my story, the wider it will spread. And I want it to go into
  circulation...So it's up to you, ladies."</p>

  <p>His words compelled the attention of every one in the room. Even Ann
  forgot her own problem as the doctor went on speaking in slurred rapid
  accents.</p>

  <p>"I'm wondering whether you are the victim of a plot, Watson. I'm back on
  leave and have just heard of the accident in the lion-house. To me, it
  stinks."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Sir Benjamin.</p>

  <p>"Because no one seems to have heard about a previous accident to the same
  hand. These are the facts. Your employee&mdash;Browning&mdash;came to my
  surgery just as I was leaving to join up. He insisted on showing me his hand.
  I barely examined it but as it was in a shocking state of gangrene I warned
  him it would have to come off and told him he must see my
  partner&mdash;Ellis&mdash;at once. Apparently he had been shovelling manure
  after cutting his finger and had picked up a malignant germ."</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul," remarked Sir Benjamin. "I knew nothing of this. Did you,
  Richard?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Richard. "I shouldn't have believed it, if I had. Browning's
  an inspired liar."</p>

  <p>"His hand didn't lie," snapped the doctor. "This is the sequel. He seems a
  stoical bloke, for he went home to his dinner instead of waiting for my
  partner. Not long afterwards he was teasing a lion when it caught his hand.
  He told a fellow-worker it was nothing and he bound it up with a filthy
  handkerchief. When eventually he went to the surgery, Ellis condemned the
  hand. He explained 'A lion done it,' so Ellis naturally accepted the gangrene
  as the result of a neglected bite. It was so evident that he never inquired
  the date of the accident, especially as he had to arrange for a rush
  operation."</p>

  <p>The doctor shook back his cowlick and sawed the air with his forefinger.
  Looking around her, it struck Ann that while Sir Benjamin showed excited
  interest, the others seemed to be on guard. Sir Oswald's eyes narrowed
  defensively when the doctor appealed to him.</p>

  <p>"How does this business strike you, Peacock? Remember, it's not the time
  to be cautious. You are not making a statement to the Press. I want you to
  speak openly, as a friend of Watson's."</p>

  <p>"The inference is obvious," said Sir Oswald acidly. "Speaking without
  prejudice, I should say the man thought he could soak Watson for heavier
  damages than he would get in compensation for an accident."</p>

  <p>"Surely it would need superhuman nerve to engineer the second accident,"
  protested the professor.</p>

  <p>"Not in Browning's case," said Sir Benjamin. "He's a sort of lumpish
  half-wit. Very useful with the more dangerous animals as he does not know the
  meaning of fear. But he has not the intelligence to think out such a
  scheme."</p>

  <p>"My point exactly," nodded the doctor. "It bears the mark of a different
  order of brain. A brain that was swift to see the possibilities of the first
  accident and make capital out of it. It was quick work. Browning was a lion
  casualty less than two hours after I told him he must lose his hand. Does
  that suggest anything to you, Peacock?"</p>

  <p>"It looks as though he was got at by someone on the spot," replied Sir
  Oswald.</p>

  <p>The doctor's eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>"If you think the same, Watson," he said, "Browning is still in hospital,
  but well enough to be interviewed. Make him talk. You could give him the
  works, but if pressure fails, he is bound to respond to bribery. Don't forget
  there may be other attempts. It's up to you to find out <i>who</i> is behind
  it all...Good-night. Give my love to the children, Mrs. Blake."</p>

  <p>The doctor included every one in a general nod of farewell. He was
  striding towards the door when Sir Oswald recalled him sharply.</p>

  <p>"Stop, Hogarth, please. The cap you have presented is of specially
  unbecoming design, but I would like to be first to try it on. First, I'll
  come out into the open and say that I am frankly opposed to the Zoo. I
  consider you a good friend but a bad patriot, Watson."</p>

  <p>"Hang it." Sir Benjamin's voice was aggrieved. "I bought a whole blinking
  Spitfire."</p>

  <p>"That gesture was suspiciously like a bribe in the grand manner. But in
  spite of my private prejudices, I need hardly say I dissociate myself from an
  alliance with one of your employees. Apart from its mean and disgusting
  nature, I have to consider <i>my</i> reputation. That is as much to me as
  your Zoo is to you."</p>

  <p>The angry flush on Sir Oswald's face and the blue fire in his eyes made
  him appear so forcefully handsome that Ann could understand his wife's gaze
  of admiration. Then Richard spoke with gentle insinuation.</p>

  <p>"A statement from you will be unnecessary, Professor. It stands to reason
  that you could not afford to risk the future of your charming wife and
  enchanting family."</p>

  <p>His words made Kitty feel both uncomfortable and guilty as she remembered
  her imprudent collaboration with Ann. Dr. Hogarth had bred an atmosphere of
  general suspicion. She reminded herself that this charming girl&mdash;in
  spite of her surface candour&mdash;might be an adventuress and the accomplice
  of some unknown person.</p>

  <p>"How did she get here?" she asked herself. "Big Ben didn't expect her. He
  just went out and brought her in. Like that. Found her under the gooseberry
  bush. Men are such fools."</p>

  <p>"Well, Hogarth," said Sir Benjamin, "I can't thank you enough. I'll follow
  up your suggestion and turn the heat on Browning. If I can produce a signed
  statement from him there'll be a swing of the pendulum back to me. The
  British public is always out to see justice and fair play. Bless it."</p>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">Sir Benjamin was in a highly emotional state as he took Dr.
  Hogarth's arm and walked with him out into the hall. When the door was
  closed, Lady Peacock exploded in ladylike bursts, like a geyser inadequately
  soaped.</p>

  <p>"<i>Well</i>. Of all the&mdash;The marvel is that man has a single
  patient."</p>

  <p>"They flock to him because he knows his onions," explained the professor,
  who used slang as an antidote to the meticulous English of his lectures.</p>

  <p>"I adore him," said Kitty. "He thought&mdash;he spoke. No second
  thoughts."</p>

  <p>Ann felt suddenly cold as she crossed over to the fire. There seemed to be
  an actual foundation for her fear of a hideous conspiracy. Two attempts had
  been made to turn harmless animals into executioners. A tame lion was baited
  to attack its keeper&mdash;and a good-natured elephant maddened to terror by
  a most opportune mouse.</p>

  <p>"Thank heaven I'm not involved," she thought. "This is too dangerous a
  place."</p>

  <p>Then&mdash;as was natural to youth&mdash;she began to think about her
  private affairs. Inaction was making her grow desperate because of her
  enforced absence from the tower-room and the difficulty of keeping a watch.
  While she tried to comfort herself by the argument that any latecomer would
  wait upstairs on the chance of meeting the other reunionists, she became
  aware of a distracting possibility. If Stephen read her signature in
  Richard's register, he would conclude that she had come and gone. So he would
  not wait for her.</p>

  <p>"I must rub it out at once," she thought.</p>

  <p>Fortunately it was written in pencil so that she only required
  india-rubber and another chance to escape. As she gazed around her, Kitty
  Blake seemed to be the only person she could trust.</p>

  <p>The professor's wife had taken advantage of a temporary vacancy to occupy
  Lady Peacock's fireside chair. Her green slippers were stretched to the blaze
  as she smoked a cigarette with enjoyment. When she glanced at the girl across
  the wide expanse of white rug&mdash;which rather resembled a soiled
  snowdrift&mdash;her beautiful eyes looked sepia-brown and still as pools of
  peat-water, shaming the artificial red of her hair.</p>

  <p>Ann crossed over to her and spoke persuasively.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe you are really 'Susannah.'"</p>

  <p>"Ask the Elders to put you wise," said Kitty impishly. "How did the
  bedroom drama shape?"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't a bedroom. I want to tell you about it."</p>

  <p>In a rapid undertone, she confided the story of the society and its
  reunion. It was not until she had finished that she realised the stiffness of
  Kitty's flexible face.</p>

  <p>"You had better tell this to Sir Benjamin," she advised. "You are a guest
  in his house."</p>

  <p>"I can't," wailed Ann. "Richard thoughtfully made that clear to me."</p>

  <p>Kitty's eyes clouded with deeper doubt when the girl explained the slur on
  her character, implied by the term&mdash;"Sullied Soul."</p>

  <p>"Why are you unloading on me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Because I want to get back to the tower-room&mdash;and you helped to
  cover me before."</p>

  <p>"But I thought then you were up to some practical joke. An apple-pie bed
  or a booby-trap for Richard. I've played the fool myself in my youth....must
  confess Dr. Hogarth has made me feel very uncomfortable. I wonder whether one
  can trust any one. There are big financial interests at stake over the sale
  of this new property. And men will do anything for money."</p>

  <p>"But what have I to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;except that you are such a lady of mystery with all your
  comings and goings. I can have nothing to do with mysteries. I've loved
  meeting you, but you <i>are</i> a stranger. Sir Benjamin is my friend.
  Naturally he comes first."</p>

  <p>Ann realised that she had made a grave mistake in her second appeal to
  Mrs. Blake, yet she could neither blame nor dislike her. She felt sure that
  Kitty would never grudge service to others, while she owed her loyalty to her
  family and her friends. This very quality would turn her into a kind of enemy
  agent, on the watch for any suspicious action.</p>

  <p>"It's worse than ever," she thought. "I've got her against me now.
  Well&mdash;I must depend on myself."</p>

  <p>"Do you know Sir Benjamin well?" asked Kitty suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I never saw him before to-night," replied Ann defiantly. "I give you that
  fact on a plate. In return could you lend me a pencil-eraser? Or is it too
  compromising?"</p>

  <p>"I deserved that...Of course. Keep my seat."</p>

  <p>Kitty crossed to her husband and made him turn out his pockets, in spite
  of his protests. When he reluctantly fished up a pencil in an india-rubber
  fitted holder, she grabbed it and bore it back to Ann.</p>

  <p>"Cherish it," she said. "It's his ewe-lamb. Until it's returned, he'll be
  like the C.I.D. on your track...Oh, thank you for the chair, Miss
  Sherborne."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for the rubber, Mrs. Blake."</p>

  <p>They grinned feebly at each other, like friends greeting across a gulf.
  Then Ann turned away from the fire and wandered into the Arctic Zone of the
  window-recess, where she knew she would be undisturbed. She wanted to think
  out some method of reaching the tower-room without putting Mrs. Blake on her
  trail. She realised that the professor's wife could make a suggestion which
  would ruin all her hope of meeting Stephen. If she happened to think of it,
  she could advise Richard to lock the door which connected their place of
  reunion with the house.</p>

  <p>"There may not be a key," she thought. "Oh, pray there isn't."</p>

  <p>Her petitions were interrupted by Isabella raising her voice.</p>

  <p>"People. I've lost a husband. Has any one seen my John? And how, when and
  where?"</p>

  <p>"Your husband was in the smoking-room last time I was dummy," said Sir
  Oswald.</p>

  <p>"And <i>how</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Apparently asleep," snapped Sir Oswald, resenting the brazen
  question.</p>

  <p>"Then it's time he woke up. The poor sweet has been sitting up all night
  over his miserable work. Naturally he has to sleep in the day-time. But I'm
  told it's brilliant stuff. I'm so proud of him."</p>

  <p>"Shall I wake him up with a kiss?" asked Richard.</p>

  <p>"No. That is a wife's privilege."</p>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">When Richard followed Isabella to the hall, Ann wondered
  uneasily what fresh development would be planned between them. She could not
  forget the horror in Isabella's eyes when Richard poured his venom into her
  ears. As she was in love, however, her suspicions was of secondary interest
  compared with her own drama. Suddenly she realised that a general visit to
  the Zoo would give her the chance of going up to the tower-room, if she could
  contrive to be left behind.</p>

  <p>"They can't force me to go," she reasoned. "They may think me
  yellow&mdash;and welcome."</p>

  <p>A burst of noisy laughter heralded Sir Benjamin's return with the
  Cumberlands. The three were linked together and John was in the middle.</p>

  <p>"Isn't John Cumberland handsome?" murmured Kitty. "Pity he drinks. He's
  not sober unless he's really drunk."</p>

  <p>The remark made Ann understand that John could still appeal to a certain
  type of woman as a fine man. His broad shoulders were thrown back, his blue
  eyes had grown brighter and the thick wave of his hair glittered under the
  light. Afraid that he might blurt out too much in his surprise at seeing her
  again, she went to meet him.</p>

  <p>"Hallo, John," she said casually.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he asked, staring at her without recognition. "I know I've
  seen you before but I can't place you."</p>

  <p>"I'm the girl in the train," she replied boldly. "I smiled at you but you
  didn't remember me. I'm Ann&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, <i>Ann</i>. What are you doing here? I must talk to you. Very
  urgent."</p>

  <p>John broke loose from his supporters&mdash;swerved to the right&mdash;when
  he stopped to chart a fresh course and reached her finally, after passing her
  on his trial-trip.</p>

  <p>"Blood-pressure," he explained with dignity. "Makes me giddy. Ann..."</p>

  <p>She saw a submerged memory struggle to the surface as he stared at her
  with distressed eyes.</p>

  <p>"Don't stay," he whispered. "Bad show. Damn bad show."</p>

  <p>She could only smile to reassure him, for Isabella flitted forward and
  took his arm.</p>

  <p>"No poaching," she said. "He's my husband and my most precious possession.
  If you wanted him, you should have married him."</p>

  <p>"Actually she was only a little girl then," John reminded her. "I don't
  rob chicken-coops."</p>

  <p>It was an ambitious sentence but he reeled it off glibly. As though to
  reward him Isabella pressed a finger to her lips and touched his cheek. He
  responded with a glance of slavish devotion that told Ann that any hope of
  domestic happiness was but another pipe dream.</p>

  <p>She listened eagerly to Isabella's next words.</p>

  <p>"John, my sweet, try and influence Big Ben. I've failed. I want to say
  'Good-bye' to the lions."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye?" shouted John. "Do you mean they are going to close the Zoo.
  <i>No</i>. I won't stand for that. Lions are noble. They are real pals. They
  don't get you drunk and steal your wife. You're safer in a lion's den than
  you are at a cocktail-party...But I'm not fit company for the lions. Lions
  are noble&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Steady," interrupted Sir Benjamin, as John was beginning to go through
  his oration again. "Bless the boy, it's not as bad as that. We're only
  closing to the public."</p>

  <p>"But you'll let poor old John say 'Good-bye' to the lions?" pleaded
  Isabella. "John and me. All of us."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Sir Benjamin weakened. It was evident that John's outburst had
  affected him deeply for he patted his arm.</p>

  <p>"All right, John," he said. "But on certain conditions. You must all place
  yourselves under my orders and obey them implicitly. Get your coats and
  torches and assemble in the hall."</p>

  <p>Ann thought rapidly as every one moved towards the door. She wondered
  whether she had better slip away in the confusion, or tell her host boldly
  that she wished to be left behind. Before she could decide, Kitty came out of
  the cloakroom. She wore a shabby fur coat and carried another over her
  arm.</p>

  <p>"This yours?" she asked Ann.</p>

  <p>To save argument, Ann slipped it on, while she listened to Sir Benjamin's
  instructions.</p>

  <p>"We must form a procession through the grounds. We shall be going past
  some enclosures, so none of you must lag or stray. It is easy to get lost in
  the black-out. I shall lead the way and Richard will bring up the rear. All
  go in pairs. Now&mdash;ladies to the centre and pick your partners."</p>

  <p>As they hesitated, Lady Peacock gave them a lead by taking her husband's
  arm. Obeying the signal of Kitty's eye, the professor dutifully linked
  himself with his wife. Richard approached Isabella, only to be repulsed.</p>

  <p>"No, thanks, Richard. Not while I've a perfectly good husband of my
  own."</p>

  <p>The dazzled look in John's eyes showed that he was floundering deeper in
  the bog&mdash;following a flame in the gleam of faerie eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are odd man out, Richard," said Sir Benjamin. "I claim the privilege
  of escorting Miss Sherborne."</p>

  <p>It was Ann's chance and she jumped at it.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you. I don't want to go."</p>

  <p>"Not go?" repeated Sir Benjamin. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"I hate to see caged animals."</p>

  <p>When she played her trump card Ann lost the game.</p>

  <p>"That settles it," exclaimed Sir Benjamin triumphantly. "Now you
  positively must come. You've got to see how I have solved the problem. It
  will make you happy to see <i>my</i> lions."</p>

  <p>Further protest was useless. Her arm was gripped and she was marched
  through the open door and out into the darkness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-05"
     id="ch-05"></a>V. &mdash; "TIGER BURNING BRIGHT"</h2>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">AS her host guided her down the terrace steps, Ann had the
  impression of being caught up in the grip of some inexorable mechanism. The
  iron pressure of his fingers suggested a robot-hand which feeds machinery,
  rather than flesh and blood. To increase her uneasiness, he was wearing an
  old tweed greatcoat, which had caught&mdash;and held&mdash;a pungent odour.
  Sir Benjamin felt like metal and smelt like a lion; and this composite force
  was propelling her on through the darkness to some unknown peril.</p>

  <p>Although her thoughts were confused, she had an elemental premonition of
  disaster, connected with the Zoo. Her ideas on the subject of captive animals
  were definite. She believed that the lions she had heard roaring in the
  wilderness were happier in fulfilling their nature under Jungle law and that,
  in spite of steam-heated luxury and super-rations, their imprisoned brothers
  must resent the agency which provided manicure and dental attention for red
  claw and fang.</p>

  <p>She told herself that on one side of the bars was a savage and revengeful
  instinct&mdash;awaiting its chance&mdash;and on the other, a conspiracy
  infinitely more cruel and treacherous. If the two combined, they must
  precipitate some terrible tragedy.</p>

  <p>As Sir Benjamin pulled her on through the darkness, her knees shook with
  sudden weakness. It was a reminder that she had missed her dinner and that,
  when she asked hopefully for poached eggs in the grill, she had been told
  that they were off the menu. As a consequence of unfamiliar food-rationing,
  her light meal had been in the feather-weight class and insufficient to
  fortify her against the fatigue and disappointment of the evening.</p>

  <p>But exhaustion and frayed nerves were little compared with the threat of
  frustrated purpose. Until then she had not known the full strength of her
  desire, nurtured through years of silence and solitude. It possessed her so
  entirely that it was agony to think of any life apart from Stephen.</p>

  <p>"What's the good of kicking?" she asked herself numbly. "I'll have to go
  through with it. Years and years. Others do. If they can bear it, I can."</p>

  <p>Hopeful of gleaning some crumb of comfort, she appealed to Sir
  Benjamin.</p>

  <p>"How long will it take to visit the lions?"</p>

  <p>Unfortunately he took it for granted that she was hoping for a prolonged
  entertainment. His voice was apologetic when be explained:</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't guarantee any time or even anything. The lions run
  their own show. But I promise you I'll do my best not to rush you."</p>

  <p>Although he was making her kiss the scourge, she managed to mumble her
  thanks.</p>

  <p>"They'll probably be prowling about in the underground passages," went on
  Sir Benjamin. "But they have an uncanny way of smelling out the public. They
  like visitors...'Ware barbed wire. We are going through a gate."</p>

  <p>The words chilled Ann because they seemed to indicate a definite stage in
  the journey.</p>

  <p>"Are the animals roaming about free?" she asked nervously.</p>

  <p>"Mainly," Sir Benjamin told her. "But there have to be certain
  enclosures."</p>

  <p>Ann strained her eyes, trying to see her surroundings. She had vaguely
  noticed that instead of following the main path away from the house, they had
  turned to the right. The night was dark and windless and only a few stars
  were visible. She picked out some of the largest shining from shrouded
  constellations&mdash;Aldebaran, Capella, the Twins and the Square of
  Pegasus&mdash;while she listened to the excited chatter from the procession
  straggling behind them. She recognised Kitty's laugh and John's high-pitched
  voice; but they seemed to be manufacturing thrills.</p>

  <p>"Did I hear Lady Peacock scream?" asked Sir Benjamin. "I know her devoted
  husband is squeaking like a bat to keep her company."</p>

  <p>"But <i>can</i> you hear a bat squeak?" queried Ann, trying to force an
  interest.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;and that's why you can't hear him. But he's squealing all right.
  He's a funk. I'd like to see them in a raid, except for the Zoo, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you take precautions."</p>

  <p>"Yes, worse luck. Bound to, under regulations. Richard, two of the keepers
  and I form the execution squad. Although I've never hunted, I'm a crack shot,
  and Richard doesn't miss too often...Is that you, Professor? Anything
  wrong?"</p>

  <p>A burly form had charged forward through the darkness. Waving his torch
  with a majestic gesture he halted the procession like a policeman, while he
  drew Sir Benjamin aside. After an argument, conducted in whispers, Sir
  Benjamin went ahead, leaving Ann with the professor.</p>

  <p>"Lead on, Skipper," he shouted, before he spoke to Ann in a low voice.
  "Hope you don't mind. I've just rammed it home to Big Ben that he is
  responsible for the safety of the party, so he must be entirely free. Sorry.
  I know you are very much a modern but it had to be that way."</p>

  <p>Although it was a relief to feel the pressure of a well-padded arm, Ann
  became suspicious.</p>

  <p>"Did your wife send you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"She did," replied the professor. "She was giving me a break. She knows
  how susceptible I am. When my boys are older, I shall warn them against women
  like Isabella; but when I see her, I fall for her every time."</p>

  <p>"And did your wife tell you I am an adventuress? Is that my special
  lure?"</p>

  <p>"To be tactless, she merely thought you looked scared."</p>

  <p>Ann was too truthful to protest although cowardice was anathema in her
  code. Her keen ear kept catching distant intermittent noises&mdash;strange
  hideous sounds which would have been merely a natural feature of a zoo during
  daylight hours. She heard snarls and growls, challenging their approach. She
  was chilled by a maniac laugh as though some invisible watcher knew that they
  were being led into an ambush. Once she was startled by a horrible parody of
  a human voice.</p>

  <p>"You're shivering," said the professor. "Are you cold?"</p>

  <p>"No," she admitted. "It's funk. But I shouldn't. I'm used to this sort of
  thing."</p>

  <p>In spite of her discomfort, she acquired some spurious courage by giving
  the professor a brief summary of her past seven years.</p>

  <p>"Amazing record," he remarked. "But why are you so jittery now, Miss
  Livingstone?"</p>

  <p>"Because my next journey may be to the moon. I'm scared of Richard. It's
  like all of us going through a gunpowder shed with safety torches while he
  has a naked light. But it's everything&mdash;the darkness, all these queer
  noises, and Sir Benjamin. He scares me."</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">"Why?" asked the professor. "He may seem an oddity to you
  but actually he is one of those simple souls who are bewildered by the world
  they find themselves in. He can't understand all the cracks in our
  civilisation to which we appear blind. But I can tell you this. He has not a
  mean thought and he would not do a mean action. All his friends love him. At
  the risk of sounding melodramatic I'll tell&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His words were lost in a violent crash as though a barrier were being
  demolished by a battering-ram. The blows were repeated in a succession of
  thunderous cracks which sounded so near to her that Ann flinched, in
  momentary expectation of attack.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Sounds like Gentle Georgie," replied the professor. "A rhinoceros with an
  evil temper. But I was going to tell you about Big Ben."</p>

  <p>Ann was not listening for, with every nerve aquiver, she was waiting for
  the next assault. The rhinoceros seemed to be keeping pace with them on his
  side of the barrier...Suddenly she was chilled by a horrible possibility.
  Richard knew all the animals' habits and could arrange for an open gate or a
  weak spot in the stockade. She pictured that great armoured shape with its
  deadly horn, charging them in the darkness, like a tank in battle, while she
  heard Sir Benjamin's voice speaking with the pride of the showman.</p>

  <p>"That's Gee-Gee. Tame as a kitten. He knows my step."</p>

  <p>"The Zoo is certainly a weird place at night," commented the professor.
  "Have you heard what I was telling you?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word," admitted Ann.</p>

  <p>"I thought not. Well, you shall do the talking for a change. As a
  stranger, how does the situation here strike you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not a stranger." Ann dared to speak recklessly. "And I know that
  Richard used to talk about inheriting his uncle's money seven years ago."</p>

  <p>"That's enough to go on with. In strict confidence, some of Big Ben's
  special friends have no illusions about the character of his nephew. So we've
  banded ourselves into a sort of C.I.D. We are very zealous and far from
  subtle. The idea is to let Richard understand that we are very much on his
  track. I'll give you an example."</p>

  <p>The professor began to chuckle before he explained.</p>

  <p>"When Big Ben had tummy-pains, Hogarth sent up specimens for immediate
  analysis. And he let Richard know what he had done."</p>

  <p>"Did they find poison?" asked Ann.</p>

  <p>"No. It was straight gastritis."</p>

  <p>"But you can't spend your lives hanging around the Zoo. That is the danger
  spot. Richard could fix up an accident."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards? He would have to get away with it and that's not easy. He
  is the obvious suspect. Besides I think a zoo-murder here would be a
  particularly difficult proposition. The animals are tame and Big Ben has
  apparent control over them, while his strength is abnormal."</p>

  <p>"I can believe that," said Ann grimly, thinking of the iron grip on her
  arm.</p>

  <p>"In one way his power is a drawback," went on the professor. "He and
  Richard are both exhibitionists and they show off one against the other. Big
  Ben scores over the great snakes. He winds them round him and vows he can
  flex his muscles so that they cannot crush him. Richard is very jealous but
  his uncle has warned him off the boas and pythons. Altogether childish."</p>

  <p>"Insane, I think. Imagine any one wanting to go around draped with
  snakes."</p>

  <p>"It's the spirit of emulation. Big Ben has a full house to-night, and I am
  afraid he will want to show off before his audience. He is very excited over
  Hogarth's news. If he can prove conspiracy over these accidents it would put
  him in the clear."</p>

  <p>There was no longer need to whisper since the noisier element in the
  procession had begun to sing "There'll always be an England."</p>

  <p>Torches were flashed on either side of the track, revealing the metallic
  glitter of wire-mesh and dim shapes galloping away through the shadows.</p>

  <p>"Stop singing," roared Sir Benjamin. "And keep your lights down. You'll
  stampede the animals."</p>

  <p>The words reminded Ann of the elephant-house. But for the accident of his
  roll, the unconscious James would have been trampled into eternal oblivion.
  This furtive chuckling darkness held more than danger. While some were
  playing the fool, Death had passed by and touched his victim.</p>

  <p>In a flash from the future Ann knew that one of them was doomed to die
  that night.</p>

  <p>Then Lady Peacock gave a piercing shriek.</p>

  <p>"There's a face in the sky," she screamed.</p>

  <p>Disobeying the order someone had flashed a torch upwards, when the thin
  finger of light, feeling its way through the air, had caught and held a white
  blurred face&mdash;strange and unearthly&mdash;which appeared to be hanging
  in space.</p>

  <p>As the apparition vanished the professor explained it to Ann.</p>

  <p>"Only a giraffe. You must have seen herds of them in Africa. What's the
  matter?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she replied, "except I wish we were going back, instead of
  being nearly there."</p>

  <p>"Now, listen. Like pain, fear can be a valuable emotion, provided we use
  it to localise a danger. But you're flopping about&mdash;afraid of this,
  afraid of that. Try and find out exactly what you dread."</p>

  <p>"I can't. I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Suppose I help you? You are thinking of the expression in Isabella's eyes
  when Richard whispered some suggestion to her. Her look of horror may mean
  dirty business. Correct?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You're wizard. What a comfort to know. I just went into a flap."</p>

  <p>"Fine. Now I shall rope you in with us to watch Richard and Isabella.
  Kitty is already on the job&mdash;hence this change of partners. She had
  hooked herself to Richard and he'll have the dickens of a job getting out of
  her clutches. In confidence, my wife is a very clever woman, although she
  does her best not to be recognised as one. She'd rather be a syren. Feminine
  vanity."</p>

  <p>Again the procession was halted at Sir Benjamin's command.</p>

  <p>"I want complete silence now. We are getting near the cages. Every one
  must go in single file and keep the line, so as not to get near the bars.
  There is a chance one of the lions might be on the look-out."</p>

  <p>"Look out for what?" demanded Lady Peacock.</p>

  <p>"Well, he might hook someone through the bars," Richard answered for his
  uncle. "Just to attract attention, you know. The lions are definitely
  matey."</p>

  <p>"Sir Benjamin," called Lady Peacock shrilly. "Before I take another step I
  want to know exactly where you are leading us."</p>

  <p>"To the inner cages," replied her host. "We use them at feeding time."</p>

  <p>Again the procession moved on slowly through the darkness, while Sir
  Benjamin, with the instinct of a showman, exploited his sense of the
  dramatic. Creeping on his toes he directed them in whispers as he led them
  flush with a barrier.</p>

  <p>"Keep single-file through the screens. I'm going ahead to turn on the
  light."</p>

  <p>There was one effect he could not have stage-managed. As Ann was squeezing
  through the flaps of the doorway a lion roared. In the confined space the
  noise was so tremendous that she felt almost blasted, as though through the
  shock of an explosion.</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">"Hannibal's on guard," shouted Sir Benjamin jubilantly.
  "Stout fellow. He's challenging us. Friends, faithful Hannibal."</p>

  <p>Again the lion roared&mdash;created the shattering effect of a fall of
  coal in a mine.</p>

  <p>"He says 'Pass, friends,'" interpreted Sir Benjamin.</p>

  <p>After the darkness Ann's eyes were dazzled by the light, even though it
  was dimmed. The party was crowded in a corridor between large cages which
  were empty with one exception. But while the almost deserted house&mdash;with
  its promise of a speedy return&mdash;raised Ann's spirits, it appeared to be
  a general disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Where are Romulus and Remus?" asked the professor. "They are the star
  turns."</p>

  <p>"<i>My</i> cubs," explained Kitty proudly.</p>

  <p>While it struck Ann that the lions might have been named by a schoolboy,
  Richard underlined the fact with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"You'd never guess it, but Hannibal's cage is called 'The Alps.' By the
  way, he's a killer."</p>

  <p>"I won't have that said." Sir Benjamin's voice was stern. "It was an
  accident. He was a trifle too rough."</p>

  <p>"It was only his wife," explained Richard. "And 'Each man kills the thing
  he loves.' How have you managed to survive, Isabella?"</p>

  <p>As Ann looked at the wife-killer, she was reminded of his resemblance to a
  mid-Victorian relative in the family album. He was an enormous beast with a
  bushy black mane and a self-righteous expression. When Sir Benjamin extended
  his hand through the bars of his cage, he seized it between his teeth and
  then contemptuously rejected it, as though it were imported meat and not up
  to his standard.</p>

  <p>"He's kissing me," explained Sir Benjamin.</p>

  <p>Immediately Richard seized the lion's jaws and forced them apart.</p>

  <p>"Like to see his teeth?" he asked nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>Ann noticed that John watched him with an expression of shrinking
  fascination, while he laughed loudly when the lion shook himself free.
  Stalking to a corner of his cage, as far as possible from Richard's polluting
  touch, he lay down with his corpulent back pointedly turned towards his
  visitors.</p>

  <p>"Thank goodness," whispered Lady Peacock to Ann. "That lion's got the most
  sense of the lot. Let's hope we can go back now. Frankly, I'm terrified of
  lions. Aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," replied Ann. "They remind me too much of cats. But
  perhaps you are frightened of cats too. Some people are."</p>

  <p>"Please don't mention Lord Roberts to <i>me</i>. I am very fond of cats.
  We have three. My husband frequently gives up his meat ration to feed them.
  He says you can't explain to them that there's a war on."</p>

  <p>For the first time Ann felt herself in sympathy with the Peacocks. Until
  then she had regarded them chiefly as types of vested interests. With a
  belated appreciation of Lady Peacock's admirable self-control at bridge, she
  listened with respect to her whisper.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid there may be an accident. There are too many of us here and
  Mr. Cumberland is drunk. Suppose we make a move? My husband will back us
  up."</p>

  <p>Linked together in strange comradeship, Lady Peacock and Ann walked
  towards the door. As they reached it they were recalled by Kitty's cry of
  triumph.</p>

  <p>"Come back. They're here."</p>

  <p>Reluctantly Ann returned to a cage where two magnificent lions, with tawny
  manes, were leaping about in a state of pleased excitement. They reminded her
  of stage favourites responding to the welcome of their public and playing up
  to it.</p>

  <p>"Miss Sherborne," shouted Sir Benjamin, "meet Romulus and Remus. Shake
  hands, Remus."</p>

  <p>Ann noticed that Remus had anticipated the request. An enormous paw with
  curving claws was already thrust through the bars and clawing the air. Making
  a feeble attempt to carry on the comedy, she smiled and bowed to the
  lion.</p>

  <p>"Actually it's not etiquette to shake hands when introduced," she told
  him.</p>

  <p>"Idiotic trick to teach them," murmured Lady Peacock. "This corridor is
  too narrow for that sort of thing. You'd only be safe in the middle, if there
  were beasts on the other side too, and they all tried to hook you."</p>

  <p>Ann began to think that Lady Peacock's common sense was superior to
  Kitty's alleged brain. The professor's wife was talking baby language to the
  other lion who was trying out the effect of a little intimidation.</p>

  <p>"Don't make that ugly face at me, you great bully," she told him. "You're
  only the measly cub I used to take on my knee and dose with oil. You've heard
  some frank talk from me, my lad." She broke off to enthuse about the lions to
  Ann. "Aren't they divine? A perfect pair. In spite of their size, they're
  only babes."</p>

  <p>As though she considered the preliminary turns on the bill were over,
  Isabella sauntered towards the cage.</p>

  <p>"Hold my coat," she said to her husband. "It's stifling here."</p>

  <p>A spectacular silver figure, she fearlessly stretched a bare arm through
  the bars. Ann watched her with unwilling admiration as her slim fingers
  stroked the lion under his chin. Revealing his open throat he threw back his
  great head before he lowered it again as an invitation for her to tickle his
  ears. It was merely cat technique on a grand scale but Ann became conscious
  of growing discomfort. The house was hot and reeked of the pungent odour
  which clung to Sir Benjamin's coat; but in spite of the torrid temperature
  she felt a chill of premonition.</p>

  <p>She glanced at John who was holding Isabella's discarded
  coat&mdash;bunched up in a bundle. He had managed to free one hand and was
  snapping his fingers timidly, to invite the other lion to notice him. Somehow
  she was reminded of a small boy who longed to take part in the game of his
  superiors but lacked the courage. There was envy as well as admiration in his
  eyes when Isabella crooned to the lions.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, sweethearts. Don't forget Isabella."</p>

  <p>"Go inside and have a kissing party," shouted Sir Benjamin.</p>

  <p>Instead of responding Isabella glanced swiftly at Richard.</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "Not to-night."</p>

  <p>"But they expect you. You always go in. You can't let them down."</p>

  <p>Isabella laid her cheek against Sir Benjamin's face.</p>

  <p>"Can't you guess why I'm not going inside?" she asked. "They will know
  that I'm upset. I dare not risk an accident for their sakes&mdash;and
  yours."</p>

  <p>"Really, I'm touched," muttered Sir Benjamin, his face working with
  emotion.</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> touching," sneered Richard. "You take indirect risks while
  she takes direct risks. Same results. The curtain rings down."</p>

  <p>As she listened Ann became sure that Isabella had lied. Her nerve had
  broken and she dared not venture inside the cage because she feared the man
  who dominated her will.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't get a wrong impression," Sir Benjamin explained to Ann.
  "Romulus and Remus would never turn on a friend. I'll show you how safe it
  is."</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear," groaned Lady Peacock, "when will this pantomime end?"</p>

  <p>Sir Benjamin went through a door at the end of the corridor and reappeared
  at the back of the lions' cage.</p>

  <p>"Romulus. Remus."</p>

  <p>At the sound of his tolling voice, both lions bounded at him and their
  combined weight threw him to the ground. As he fell they leaped upon him and
  the three rolled over and over, while the beasts growled and Sir Benjamin
  shouted. The performance appeared so savagely realistic that Ann thought Sir
  Benjamin was being mauled, until she noticed that the other spectators were
  trying to disguise their boredom at a too-familiar display. It ended in a
  pleasant demonstration of affection when Sir Benjamin rose to his feet; one
  lion placed his huge paws upon his shoulder and licked his face, while the
  other rubbed against his leg.</p>

  <p>"Great show," shouted John. "Shall we chuck coppers?"</p>

  <p>"For mercy's sake, <i>don't</i>," cried Lady Peacock. "You might irritate
  them."</p>

  <p>"I seem to recollect a poem about King Francis and the lions," remarked
  Sir Oswald. "I used to recite it when I was a lad."</p>

  <p>"At parties," said his wife. "I was a small girl and I used to admire you
  so when you shouted the last line."</p>

  <p>Sir Oswald responded to her flattery by expanding his chest and clearing
  his throat.</p>

  <p>"'He threw the glove&mdash;but not with love&mdash;right in the lady's
  face,'" he declaimed.</p>

  <p>"Quite a juicy test of marital affection," remarked Richard. "Mrs. Blake,
  do you think the professor would jump into a lion's den if you dropped your
  glove?"</p>

  <p>"He jolly well would, with gloves the price they are," Kitty told him.
  "You wouldn't believe how mean that man is. But I wouldn't want him to be
  such a darned fool."</p>

  <p>"Yet it was the flower of chivalry," said Lady Peacock. "In these days
  when women swear and smoke, I should like to think that <i>my</i> husband
  thought me worth the risk of his life."</p>

  <p>"My dear, don't forget the lines about the test being decreed by vanity
  and not love," her husband reminded her hastily.</p>

  <p>"Would John jump for Isabella?" persisted Richard.</p>

  <p>"Of course he would." Isabella answered for her husband. "When he's roused
  John has the courage of the devil."</p>

  <p>"I believe you. I'd put my shirt on John when it came to action."</p>

  <p>Ann heard the sound of voices while her ears failed to register the words.
  Her attention was gripped by a movement in the opposite cage against which
  John was leaning. Something glowed in the shadow&mdash;something like twin
  green flames.</p>

  <p>"Tiger, tiger, burning bright&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As the lines shot through her brain, she saw the lowered mask of a large
  tiger&mdash;a dazzle of orange, black and snowy-white&mdash;crawling across
  the cage.</p>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">It was advancing imperceptibly, after the fashion of a cat
  stalking a bird. John's back was turned towards it as he stood, sucking in
  unaccustomed flattery, but apparently it was visible both to Richard and
  Isabella. Expecting that they would pull John away from the bars, Ann waited
  in acute suspense.</p>

  <p>To her bewilderment no one moved or uttered a word of warning. Every
  second the tiger was creeping nearer to John and she dared not delay too
  long. Rushing towards the cage she gripped John's arm and dragged him to the
  centre of the corridor, just as the tiger sprang at the bars.</p>

  <p>Instead of thanks she received general criticism.</p>

  <p>"That was a very dangerous thing to do," said Richard. "You might have
  alarmed Togo. He's quite tame."</p>

  <p>"Tame as a kitten," declared Sir Benjamin. "Now you've rattled the poor
  chap."</p>

  <p>"Personally, I don't consider that kittens are tame," remarked the
  professor. "They've often drawn my blood. They are quite gentle until you
  take your hand away and then they give you all they have."</p>

  <p>"And John might have moved, too," said Ann defensively.</p>

  <p>As though to prove his nonchalance John snapped his fingers at the
  tiger.</p>

  <p>"Going to scratch my back, were you, old chap?" he asked. "Definitely
  matey&mdash;but the custom went out with the eighteenth century. I bath every
  Saturday night. Another old English custom."</p>

  <p>"He's not so drunk as he was," thought Ann.</p>

  <p>It seemed to her that his foolish blurred expression was fading as he
  frowned in an effort to disentangle the threads of a problem.</p>

  <p>"Miss Sherborne," boomed Sir Benjamin, "I am going to put my head in the
  tiger's mouth for your special benefit. I promised you a good show."</p>

  <p>With a pang of dismay Ann realised that&mdash;subconsciously&mdash;she had
  been dreading this moment. Sir Benjamin was going to put himself at the
  mercy&mdash;not of the tiger&mdash;but of those who were waiting for his
  death. She knew that it was useless for her to protest, while her brain was
  too numb to formulate any plan. It was an occasion for lightning resource but
  she could think of only the stale trick of pretending to faint.</p>

  <p>"Hopeless," she reflected. "Lady Peacock would jump at the chance to haul
  me outside&mdash;but the show would go on."</p>

  <p>Sir Benjamin was like an excited boy at the circus&mdash;the more so
  because the circus was himself. As long as he had any audience, he would not
  cancel his last performance. Producing a large silk square he explained its
  purpose to Ann.</p>

  <p>"I keep it here for covering my hair. When I was a boy, I heard a story
  about a woman tamer who used to put her head inside a lion's mouth. One night
  a single hair got loose and tickled his throat. He just gulped...The poor
  fellow pined away from grief...Now who's going to tie me up? Ah, thanks,
  Isabella."</p>

  <p>"Too late on the draw," Ann told herself as Isabella began to wind the
  scarf expertly around Sir Benjamin's head. It might have been due to the
  overhead light but her face appeared a ghastly green. She was like an
  implacable automaton, wound up to perform inevitable movements.</p>

  <p>"Why did the others let her get in first?" she wondered. "They should have
  known this would happen."</p>

  <p>She looked at the C.I.D., which, according to the professor, was always on
  guard. To her dismay they appeared too preoccupied to notice that a
  loosely-wound scarf would give the conspiracy its chance. The professor was
  showing his new lighter to Sir Oswald while his wife jeered at his failures
  to produce a flame.</p>

  <p>Isabella finished her work by kissing the top of Sir Benjamin's head. Sir
  Benjamin turned towards the door and Ann watching him go with a leaden sense
  of destiny. A landslide was tearing away the side of a mountain and hurling
  it down upon him&mdash;and she could do nothing. But even as her heart
  pounded, Kitty darted forward.</p>

  <p>"That fold looks loose," she said, pulling at Sir Benjamin's turban with
  destructive fingers. "Sorry, Mrs. Cumberland, for an unfounded reflection.
  Well, since I've done the damage, it's up to me to put it right."</p>

  <p>She rewound the silk with such vigour that Sir Benjamin groaned.</p>

  <p>"You've certainly made a job of it," he complained. "It feels as if my
  scalp was shrinking, like those shrivelled heads they sell to tourists.
  Thanks, Kitty. See you all on the other side."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Blake looked at Ann and winked in token of mutual understanding. The
  girl noticed that she had attached herself brazenly to Richard while her
  husband talked to Isabella. In spite of their vigilance, however, she felt
  far from reassured when Sir Benjamin entered the tiger's cage through the
  door in its back.</p>

  <p>Unlike the lions the tiger gave him no welcome. He took no notice of his
  owner but appeared too conscious of his spectators. Apparently he resented
  them, for he lashed his tail as he paced his cage restlessly.</p>

  <p>"Good Togo," said Sir Benjamin. "Shut your eyes and open your mouth and
  see what Lord Woolton sends you."</p>

  <p>He prised open the animal's jaws and then paused&mdash;as though to
  heighten the thrill.</p>

  <p>"These preliminaries," he explained, "should be done to slow music,
  working up to a climax. Louder&mdash;louder. Now the roll of drums. Suddenly
  they stop. Dead silence. And then I put my head&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was over in a second. He opened the tiger's jaws wider, inserted a
  portion of his head between the teeth, withdrew it and then bowed to his
  audience. Patting the tiger's head he left the cage.</p>

  <p>Ann released her breath in a sob which was heard by Lady Peacock.</p>

  <p>"I agree with you," she said. "I found it a great strain. But the poor man
  enjoyed it. I suppose we will be allowed to go back to our bridge now that
  the performance is over. Even the lions have gone."</p>

  <p>"I think we might go," said Ann gratefully. "Some of the others are
  starting."</p>

  <p>She noticed that John was struggling unsuccessfully to guide Isabella's
  arms into the sleeves of her coat. Richard finished the job for him and then
  the three walked softly towards the door. There was a suggestion of secrecy
  in their haste which filled her with distrust. Outside stretched the Zoo with
  its lethal possibilities and in this dangerous darkness a semi-drunk John
  would be at the mercy of unscrupulous persons. Although her suspicions were
  confused she spoke impulsively.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"To the ravine," Richard told her. "We might get a peep of the lions being
  pure and simple in their natural state. They look rather impressive roaming
  about below. You might imagine they were kings of the forest and not merely
  performing fleas."</p>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">Ann looked around at the C.I.D., but the Blakes were
  definitely off-duty as they chatted to the Peacocks. While it was proof that
  they believed the danger to Sir Benjamin to be over, she was not so
  confident. But if he remembered some fresh trick to perform with the animals
  he was bound to be discouraged by the withdrawal of part of his audience.</p>

  <p>"Is it far to go?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Only a few yards," said Richard. "Coming?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then come on ahead with me. The Cumberlands will follow my light. Did you
  hear&mdash;Cumberlands?"</p>

  <p>Ann hoped he did not notice her instinctive recoil when he took her arm
  and drew her out into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"For the second time to-night we are united," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"And after you thought you had got rid of me. Too bad."</p>

  <p>"I under-rated your intelligence, my dear. Now I know you better which is
  to my advantage...We have only to pass the outdoor cages and the solaria.
  Solariums to you...Here we are."</p>

  <p>Ann gazed around her with wonder. As far as she could see in the light
  from their torches, the rim of the ravine was encircled with a low wall,
  topped with a railing, for the protection of spectators. Its rocky sides were
  left in their natural state and were a tangle of briars, bushes and rough
  grass slopes. Hanging over the bottom was a pool of strange diffused light.
  Although it was so faint it enabled her to see a dark shape stealing amid the
  boulders.</p>

  <p>"Are you allowed to show that light?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It cannot be seen from the air," explained Richard acidly. "It is
  something of the sort of thing suggested for street-illumination but rejected
  on account of the cost. I need hardly say expense is no obstacle where our
  lions are concerned. We give them our drawing-room heat&mdash;and all that we
  have is theirs, including our visitors."</p>

  <p>"Don't they prefer darkness?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know as I am not a lion. Perhaps curiosity has brought them out.
  Hopeful beasts. One day someone may lean over too far...Cumberlands, get
  down."</p>

  <p>The warning was needed for John was standing on the top of the wall and
  leaning over the railings.</p>

  <p>"Look," he shouted. "One, two. By gum, there are three of them. Don't they
  look fine lurking among the rocks?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly Ann became aware of a disturbing possibility as she flashed her
  torch over the sides of the ravine.</p>

  <p>"Are we safe?" she asked. "It's only a gentle slope. What's to stop them
  climbing up to us?"</p>

  <p>She was reassured when Richard told her that the sides were built up into
  a sheer wall at the bottom and further guarded by an overhang of rock.</p>

  <p>"It is rather on the principle of a bottle-neck," he said. "No lion could
  possibly jump clear of it...Well, Isabella, have you seen enough of your
  beloved felines?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "I'm coming. I only want to find my lipstick...<i>Oh</i>,
  I've dropped my bag over the wall." She flashed her torch below and added, "I
  can see it. It's not rolled far. Get it, Richard."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," he promised. "It's a daylight job."</p>

  <p>"But I value it. My John gave it to me. It will be ruined if it lies out
  in the damp all night. If you won't get it, I must find someone who will.
  Someone not yellow."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> will," offered John.</p>

  <p>"No, sweetheart, not you," said Isabella. "You're another personal
  treasure. I value you too much to risk you."</p>

  <p>"She means you're too tight," translated Richard. "I suppose I'm the
  unwilling victim. Curse the bag. Let me see exactly where it is. Every
  one&mdash;lights."</p>

  <p>As the concentrated beam from their torches was thrown down the sides of
  the ravine, it picked up a flash of silver and displayed the bag lying on a
  bank of grass overgrown with briars. Ann knew that she could recover it
  easily, but she doubted whether a drunken man could keep his footing. To her
  dismay, however, John was fired by his wife's rare tenderness, for when
  Richard began to climb the wall, he dragged him back to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Stay out of this," he shouted. "No business of yours. She's my wife, in
  case you forget it&mdash;again."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," urged Isabella. "I won't let you go. It's
  manslaughter."</p>

  <p>As she flung her arms around John, Richard swung himself over the railings
  and began to climb down the slope. Breaking loose, John pushed his wife back
  and before either girl could stop him had scrambled clumsily over the
  barrier. He put on a reckless spurt to try and overtake Richard, and reached
  the bag just as Richard stretched out his hand. In the scuffle which
  followed, when both men tried to clutch it, it was pushed free of the briars
  and&mdash;dropping over a ledge&mdash;disappeared from sight.</p>

  <p>"John, come back," called Isabella. "Richard, <i>make</i> him come
  back."</p>

  <p>"He'd better not try anything," shouted John.</p>

  <p>"Don't start anything here, you fool," said Richard. "We shall both of us
  end up among the lions."</p>

  <p>Although she felt it was hopeless Ann appealed to Isabella.</p>

  <p>"Make them both come back," she urged.</p>

  <p>"I can't control them," said Isabella tonelessly. "Besides, the slope is
  easy."</p>

  <p>"Not for John."</p>

  <p>As she watched the two men sliding down the banks of the ravine, Ann began
  to fear treachery. She was not convinced that the bag's second fall was
  accidental, since it had shot forward in a silver streak, as though someone
  had thrown it. In the wavering beam of her torch she saw it far below on the
  lip of the rocky ledge which formed part of the overhang. Richard was
  crabbing towards it cautiously while John was descending with the fury of an
  avalanche, bringing with him fragments of the ravine. Amid the constant
  rattle of dislodged stones, they could hear the slide of his boots over rock
  whenever he slipped.</p>

  <p>He was first to reach the bag&mdash;when he appeared to lose his footing.
  His legs shout out and he hung over the ledge, suspended by his hands.
  Flinging himself down Richard gripped his wrists.</p>

  <p>"Hang on," he shouted. "I've got you."</p>

  <p>Instead of obeying the advice, John kicked against the side of the rock
  and swung violently outwards. The jerk was too severe for Richard's wrists.
  His fingers flexed and John dropped down into the ravine.</p>

  <p>Ann saw the flash of a tawny form as the first lion leaped...</p>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">Unable to watch the tragedy she seized Isabella's arm.</p>

  <p>"Get Sir Benjamin," she screamed.</p>

  <p>Isabella's limbs were rigid from shock and her feet dragged over the
  ground as Ann pulled her through the darkness, steering by the cages.</p>

  <p>"It's hopeless," she repeated calmly, as though she were discussing an
  impersonal problem. "It's always best to let the lions finish them. They feel
  nothing. But they suffer if you try to help them. And it's never any
  good."</p>

  <p>Although she was almost a dead weight Ann reached the lion-house just as
  she heard the beating of Richard's feet behind her. Instead of dropping down
  to the ravine, in an attempt to control the lions, he obviously believed any
  rescue to be impossible.</p>

  <p>When Ann squeezed through the screens, Sir Benjamin was fondling a
  leopardess. He looked up sharply when the girl ran down the corridor.</p>

  <p>"John has fallen into the lions' den," she gasped.</p>

  <p>For a moment she thought Sir Benjamin was going to have a stroke. His face
  turned almost black from a rush of colour which ebbed swiftly&mdash;leaving
  it ashen and streaked with faint purple threads.</p>

  <p>"Richard," he shouted as his nephew entered with Isabella, "get
  Farquharson. Bring rifles and follow me down."</p>

  <p>"Can we help?" asked the professor.</p>

  <p>"No. Go back to the house."</p>

  <p>As Sir Benjamin and Richard dashed through the inner door leading to the
  subterranean passages Sir Oswald took command.</p>

  <p>"Come with me, Mrs. Cumberland," he said, taking Isabella's arm. "A stiff
  drink will do you good. Look on the bright side. The worst is not
  certain...Who knows the way back?"</p>

  <p>"I do," said Kitty. "I've often been here at night, to nurse the cubs.
  Come with us, Miss Sherborne. I'll lead."</p>

  <p>As Ann went with the Blakes out into the darkness she heard the roaring of
  the lions...</p>

  <p>The sound revived a memory she had done her utmost to forget. When she was
  in Africa she had seen a bearer killed by a lion. Although she had been
  appalled, the accident had been vaguely redeemed by its savage setting. The
  humans were trespassers in the wilds and she had witnessed a terrible episode
  of jungle law in operation.</p>

  <p>But the catastrophe in the ravine filled her with the sick horror of a
  witness to an execution scene in a civilised country. It seemed
  obscene&mdash;outside the decencies of ordinary life and an outrage on the
  domestic etiquette of the eight o'clock breakfast-hour.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she realised that the heavy rumbling thunder had ceased.</p>

  <p>"He's dead," she told herself. "Thank God, it is over."</p>

  <p>She was conscious of being in a hideous nightmare as she stumbled through
  the darkness with the aid of the professor's arm, but the knowledge that John
  could suffer no more was an unconscious relief. Presently Kitty spoke to her
  in a matter-of-fact voice.</p>

  <p>"That's better. Relax. You've been as rigid as a poker...Now you're more
  normal I want to ask questions. To begin with, was any one to blame?"</p>

  <p>Ann began to experience some of the traditional comfort of holding an
  inquest.</p>

  <p>"It's difficult to say," she explained. "It was all dark and confused.
  Isabella dropped her bag but it was easy for any one with an average head to
  reach it. Isabella asked Richard, but John insisted."</p>

  <p>"Then you think it was his own fault?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. Richard tried to save him. But they kept saying all the
  things which would egg him on."</p>

  <p>"I know...Well, this means Big Ben will lose his beloved Zoo. The news of
  this accident will go round with the morning milk and there's a meeting
  to-morrow to decide about the renewal of the licence....could weep. But I
  suppose it's worse for poor John...Here we are. Mind the steps."</p>

  <p>When Ann re-entered the drawing-room she looked around her with a feeling
  of incredulity. Here&mdash;where white walls, blue upholstery and gilt chairs
  combined to create an effect of chill elegance and tranquillity&mdash;it was
  impossible to realise the recent tragedy. Standing on the snowdrift rug
  before the fire, she tried to get warm while she watched Isabella.</p>

  <p>Lady Peacock placed her in a chair and Sir Oswald persuaded her to drink
  from the glass he held. In their opinion the tragic widow was behaving very
  well&mdash;which was another way of saying that she was quiet. To encourage
  her to maintain her glassy-eyed rigour, they yearned over her with pats of
  approval.</p>

  <p>"Splendid, my dear," applauded Sir Oswald. "You are behaving like an
  Englishwoman."</p>

  <p>"A war-time Englishwoman," said Lady Peacock to improve the compliment.
  "Come. One more drop."</p>

  <p>Isabella swallowed mechanically and then suddenly pushed away the glass so
  that the brandy was spilt. Sight had returned to her eyes&mdash;understanding
  to her mind. With a look of horror&mdash;as though a grave had split open in
  the drawing-room, she stared at the open door.</p>

  <p>Sir Benjamin stood on the threshold, one arm thrown around John. They were
  so dusty and dilapidated that they suggested a pair of music-hall artistes
  about to perform a comic tramp bicycle act. Both were flushed and beaming
  with jubilation although one side of John's face was streaked with blood.</p>

  <p>Limping as he walked he advanced to the middle of the
  room&mdash;bowed&mdash;and then shook hands with himself after the fashion of
  a popular pugilist.</p>

  <p>"Little Daniel returned from the lions' den," he announced. "Now, people,
  don't get me wrong. Any personal damage is solely the result of falling
  downstairs into the lions' dump."</p>

  <p>"It was Romulus and Remus," shouted Sir Benjamin. "Never touched him. I'm
  proud of them."</p>

  <p>"<i>My</i> cubs," cried Kitty. "I'm proud too. Husbands and wives, look
  the other way. I may be an abandoned woman but I've simply got to kiss little
  Daniel...Ah, Richard, you're just in time for drinks."</p>

  <p>The professor's tribute to his wife's brain made Ann understand the reason
  for Kitty's impulsive gush. It covered up the gap of an ugly omission. While
  Isabella seemed incapable of speaking to her husband, he made no movement
  towards her. Keeping his position in the centre of the group, he gripped the
  professor's hand.</p>

  <p>"This is the bloke who saved my life indirectly," he said. "See this?" He
  tapped Blake's skull. "He keeps some grey stuff inside the box. And when I
  was falling my own brain did a spot of work. I remembered his remarks about
  kittens and I realised that the wheeze was to treat the lions like kittens. I
  said to myself, 'You're safe, old man, as long as no one tries to rescue
  you.' But my noble friend&mdash;Richard&mdash;was risking his life to do
  exactly that. He had me by the wrists and was dangling me as a nice juicy
  titbit just over their heads. And here he is to take his bow."</p>

  <p>He broke off to salute Richard who had strolled into the room.</p>

  <p>"I knew," continued John, "that if you waggle anything over a kitten it
  springs up to get it. Therefore it seemed indicated that the lions would leap
  up to claw me down. So I kicked myself loose and dropped down to the bottom.
  Luckily I fell soft in a mud patch and there I lay without moving a
  finger...And the lions knew I was plastered. They behaved like perfect
  gentlemen. Just sampled my breath and asked me the name of my wine merchant.
  I want to drink to them."</p>

  <p>"We'll all drink to them," declared Kitty, still forcing the note of
  excitement. "Sir Oswald, doubles for John and the rescue party. They've
  earned it."</p>

  <p>After John had gulped down his drink he looked at his wife for the first
  time.</p>

  <p>"I've forgotten the lady's glove," he said. "Only it happens to be a
  bag."</p>

  <p>From under his coat he produced a grimy silver article.</p>

  <p>"The book of words says I should chuck it in the lady's face," he
  remarked. "But I might mark it. Here&mdash;catch."</p>

  <h3>VII.</h3>

  <p class="first">He pitched the bag with casual contempt so that it missed
  Isabella's lap and fell on the floor. Biting her lip in an effort at
  self-control she contrived to reproach her husband.</p>

  <p>"Oh, John, why did you? It was terrible of you. I&mdash;I can't talk about
  it. I've been absolutely broken."</p>

  <p>Again Kitty drew attention to herself by clapping her hands.</p>

  <p>"We are all of us shaky and ridiculous," she declared. "Nothing like
  bridge to steady the nerves. Big Ben, suppose we play in the library and
  leave the young people together."</p>

  <p>As though to indicate that "young people" was but another name for a
  newly-united couple, she beckoned to Richard and Ann.</p>

  <p>"Come along," she invited. "You can cut in."</p>

  <p>"No," said John. "I want Ann to stay here. You, too, Richard."</p>

  <p>"What's the big idea?" asked Richard when the elder people had gone. "I'd
  take things easily for a bit if I were you, old man."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. I don't need advice."</p>

  <p>John's voice was curt and he impressed Ann as being much older, as though
  the tense moments when he lay in the lions' den had acted as a forcing
  temperature on his mental growth. For the first time since she met him he
  dominated the situation without theatrical aid.</p>

  <p>"I want to ask all of you a question," he said. "Am I sober?"</p>

  <p>"It would make no odds," jeered. Richard. "Drunk or sober, you can look
  after your own interests."</p>

  <p>"You know I'm cold sober. And it's a horrible sensation. I'd forgotten
  what it was like. Things keep hitting me in the eye. Isabella, you wanted to
  see me down with the lions, but you didn't want to see me come up again. That
  sticks out."</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd," said Isabella. "If you take that tone you can hardly
  expect me to go into raptures over you now. I am honest&mdash;even if you do
  arrange for an audience to give you Dutch courage when you want to throw a
  scene."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ann knows all about us. I want her to hear too. Mary Isabella
  Cumberland, I give you notice that I am going to divorce you. You know
  there'll be no trouble about evidence. You've never paid me the compliment of
  trying to deceive me. I could stand for anything."</p>

  <p>The silence that followed was broken by Isabella's laugh.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, John. You know you can't live without me."</p>

  <p>"That was true until to-night," John told her. "But when I saw you chuck
  your bag over and I knew you wanted to get me killed, so that you could marry
  Richard, I meant to finish it your way. And then, when I was lying down there
  with the lions prowling around me, suddenly I remembered that I wanted to
  live. Ann knows why."</p>

  <p>"Of course, darling. I want you to live too."</p>

  <p>As Isabella attempted to throw her arm around him John stiffened and
  pushed her away.</p>

  <p>"Stop that," he said. "It's old stuff. I am going to marry another woman.
  I ought to thank you for to-night. You've set me free. Come, Ann."</p>

  <p>Isabella stared incredulously as he took Ann's hand and they walked
  together from the room. When they reached the hall, Ann spoke
  breathlessly:</p>

  <p>"John, you must go straight to that nice girl. At once. Before you weaken.
  Before you see <i>her</i> again."</p>

  <p>"I know," he agreed. "Directly I've washed the blood from my face."</p>

  <p>"No, don't wait for that. The gore will help to make her understand. Let
  her do it for you. She is safe to want to. And remember you must make her see
  you to-night. Once you've fixed things with her, you'll be safe. She'll never
  let you go."</p>

  <p>"No, she won't," agreed John with a chuckle. "Janie's a sticker. I'll do
  it. Thank you, Ann. Thanks for everything. Give me a kiss for luck."</p>

  <p>When the front door slammed behind John, Ann felt the glow of a happy
  ending. If she had seen him fallen from his pedestal and lying prostrate in
  the mud, she had also witnessed his first steps towards re-establishment. The
  fact that he was headed towards a normal happy life took the sting from a
  wretched situation.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she realised that it was her chance to visit the tower-room.</p>

  <p>"I've been forgetting Stephen," she thought. "When you are waiting for
  people, they always come when you least expect them. He'll be there. I know
  he's there."</p>

  <p>Confident and expectant&mdash;she ran softly upstairs and down the narrow
  passage. The light glowed in an empty room&mdash;but in her absence something
  had happened. Under her own name in the register was scrawled a small
  characteristic signature.</p>

  <p class="cp"><i><b>"Stephen."</b></i></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>VI. &mdash; A MAN WHO WASN'T THERE</h2>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">AS she gazed at the signature Ann felt a flood of
  exultation. It was proof that Stephen had actually been within those
  walls&mdash;that his hand had held the pen. Her faith was justified.</p>

  <p>Until that moment he had not been entirely real. The trouble was that the
  years of separation had been so long and she had thought of him too
  continuously. Because she saw his face everywhere in the wilderness, it had
  acquired something of the quality of a mirage&mdash;sifting like desert sand
  through the net of memory. It was this dormant sense of unreality which had
  made her protest so fiercely when John was unable to remember Stephen. Since
  then, every one appeared to grudge him any existence, while James had even
  put him in the obituary column of <i>The Times</i>.</p>

  <p>"It's true," she whispered. "He's here."</p>

  <p>Her eyes shone as she looked at the forceful signature. The letters were
  small but boldly black, with vine-like tendrils at the beginning and end of
  the capitals. It was an admittedly self-conscious effort, as Stephen had been
  ready to acknowledge.</p>

  <p>"Publicity stunt. People will say, 'Pardon? Isn't he the bloke with all
  the squiggles?' They'll fix me by them."</p>

  <p>Richard had sneered as usual.</p>

  <p>"Easy to forge," he remarked. "You are practically giving every crook an
  open cheque."</p>

  <p>For the first time Ann understood that Richard had been bitter because he
  knew he lacked the ability ever to laugh at himself. Therefore, the absurd
  signature made Stephen his superior...</p>

  <p>One moment Ann stood and smiled&mdash;the next she staggered, as though
  someone had dealt her an actual blow. Stephen had come, but he had gone
  again, while she had missed him for the childish reason of a visit to the
  Zoo.</p>

  <p>She felt outraged by the cruelty of such an inadequate end. In a sudden
  blinding light she realised the futility of those seven years of intense
  longing and deep purpose, when she had sacrificed the present for the future.
  In spite of her youth she could have been a wife and mother, if she had not
  wasted her life&mdash;keeping her eyes fixed only on the horizon.</p>

  <p>She clenched her hands in an effort to keep back her tears.</p>

  <p>"It's not true," she whispered. "God couldn't be so cruel."</p>

  <p>Her creed was her protection in the jungle, for had she not believed in
  Ultimate Good, her spirit would have been crushed by the constant
  manifestation of evil power in the wilds, where only strength or treachery
  prevailed. And now in her dark moment in the tower-room&mdash;this belief
  consoled her.</p>

  <p>"No, not God," she declared. "But man can be cruel. Richard said this
  signature would be easy to forge."</p>

  <p>She examined the name closely but without a specimen for comparison it was
  impossible to decide whether it were genuine. There was a strong case for
  forgery, since Richard had been trying persistently to get rid of her. If,
  therefore, he could fool her into believing that Stephen had visited the
  tower-room and been discouraged by its emptiness, the inference was that she
  would accept defeat.</p>

  <p>"Only it works both ways," reflected. "If Stephen really came, he is sure
  to be rushed and he wouldn't have time to hang on and wait. He would think
  that no one had turned up to the reunion, or that we had all gone...If only I
  knew <i>which</i>."</p>

  <p>While she rubbed her cheek in miserable uncertainty, a sudden possibility
  galvanised her into activity. If Stephen had only just gone there might be
  time for her to overtake him. Without pausing to think, she rushed down the
  dark shaft of the circular stair to the lobby. Its door was fitted with a
  Yale lock which snapped on being slammed, so she pushed back the catch before
  she closed it softly behind her.</p>

  <p>It gave her a faint ray of hope to know that now the door was officially
  unlocked again. As long as a Sullied Soul could still enter the reunion was
  not over.</p>

  <p>She stood for a little time looking out into the surrounding darkness and
  listening to every stir and rustle; but her super-keen sense could hear no
  sound of footsteps in the distance. With a recollection of her father's
  advice, never to get lured from the safety of a base, she turned back and
  toiled up the stairs again. With each step she felt conscious of a draining
  flatness&mdash;as though the present was not worth the effort of living and
  the future a blank.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure something terrible is going to happen," she told herself. "I've
  had my warnings. John advised me to go and so did James. Even Richard had
  been trying to make me clear out. And I believe Mark is trying to get through
  to me."</p>

  <p>As she thought of her dead father, she felt suddenly forlorn&mdash;without
  relatives or roots&mdash;and craving reassurance from some friendly human
  being. The Blakes were kind but they were too deliberately unconventional and
  she had no use for freaks. In that unstable moment of emotional stress, she
  wanted the support of someone solid and static&mdash;like Lady Peacock.</p>

  <p>"I'll get my coat and go back," she decided.</p>

  <p>Half-way down the staircase she turned giddy and had to clutch the rail to
  save a fall. The pots of pink azaleas below her began to revolve and the
  black and white marble floor-blocks started to melt one into another. As a
  rush of darkness swept past her she had a moment of sheer fright, until she
  remembered the source of her symptoms.</p>

  <p>It was an empty stomach.</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">"Fool," she scolded herself. "I'll crash the kitchen. I
  can't disturb the bridge."</p>

  <p>Although she steered a slightly unsteady course across the hall, she was
  reassured by the triumph of her common sense. Within the next minute,
  however, it suffered a further lapse. There were two doors in the back wall
  and she opened the first&mdash;only to recoil in vague distrust.</p>

  <p>Before her stretched the darkness of a long passage whose atmosphere
  registered a change of temperature. The air was damply warm and tainted with
  some faint unpleasant odour which she could not identify.</p>

  <p>Shutting the door quickly she turned the next handle and burst into the
  kitchen. The room was so spacious that it did not appear crowded although the
  entire staff of six females was in residence. It was both comfortable and
  pleasant with a hand-made wool rug before the large modern cooking-range and
  a shabby green tablecloth. A grandfather's clock ticked in a corner and a
  large tabby cat was coiled up in a basket as an additional domestic note.</p>

  <p>Ann's first glance at the staff told her that it reflected a labour
  situation due to the war. Among three girls who appeared to be of school age,
  she picked out the housemaid and the decorative parlour-maid. A third child
  wore a white overall and was apparently on the kitchen strength.</p>

  <p>A gulf of two generations stretched between them and the other three
  helpers. The women all looked over sixty and wore wedding-rings and glasses.
  Two were lean, with lined faces and gnarled hands, but the third was a stout
  dignified grandmother with a certain resemblance to the portraits of Queen
  Victoria.</p>

  <p>"Real honest-to-goodness human-beings," exulted Ann, with a friendship
  born of her loneliness. But when she smiled a welcome, they all rose to their
  feet in a general movement and stood respectfully staring at her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, please sit down," she cried. "I'm not used to palaver. I've been
  living where all whites are equal."</p>

  <p>As though they sensed that she was not telling the actual truth, they
  remained standing until she flopped down on the nearest chair. Then the
  grandmotherly cook asked her a question.</p>

  <p>"Do you require anything, miss?"</p>

  <p>"I've come to cadge food," she confessed. "I missed dinner and I'm
  starving."</p>

  <p>"Rebecca." The cook spoke to the child in the overall. "Cut some
  sandwiches for the lady. Use the ham."</p>

  <p>As she waited Ann looked around her. Every one was knitting for the Forces
  with true village-school dexterity. Their needles flashed swiftly in and out
  of khaki or navy-blue wool, while they kept their eyes fixed upon their
  visitor. As no one spoke, she began to plug her travels.</p>

  <p>"The last time I was really hungry was when I was bushed."</p>

  <p>When no one displayed any interest she began to praise the kitchen
  pet.</p>

  <p>"What a fine cat."</p>

  <p>"Leopard cub," corrected the cook bitterly. "There are no civilised
  animals here. Orphan. Leastways, it's got a no-good mother. Soon that Delia
  will live in the house altogether. She'll be coming into my kitchen and
  ordering her own food."</p>

  <p>Ann felt the allusion was rather too pointed so she spoke quickly:</p>

  <p>"Is Delia the beautiful leopardess?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The master is sloppy over her because she's got it all outside."</p>

  <p>Again Ann registered the personal touch. Instead of the flow of mutual
  sympathy for which she was longing, there seemed to be a wall built up
  between her and her fellow human-beings. Presently the constant flash and
  click of the knitting-needles made her feel dizzy again.</p>

  <p>"The room's so warm," she thought. "I feel all queer and unreal&mdash;just
  as if I wasn't here....wish that girl would hurry with my 'eats' and let me
  get away."</p>

  <p>As her eyes began to play fresh tricks upon her, blotting out portions of
  the red-brick linoleum with a swirl of black patches, she suddenly remembered
  why the faint odour in the passage was familiar.</p>

  <p>It reminded her of a tropical swamp.</p>

  <p>At that moment the girl in the overall brought her a plate of sandwiches
  and she began to eat them ravenously. After several bites her abnormal
  sensations gradually faded, so that by the time she had finished the pile her
  hands were steady again and her brain clear.</p>

  <p>"Did any one call when we were in the grounds?" she asked the cook. "A
  young man who wanted to go up to the tower-room?"</p>

  <p>"No, miss," replied the stout grandmother. "The front door hasn't rung
  since the doctor."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he didn't ring. He might have walked inside."</p>

  <p>"He couldn't. The door was locked after you all went out."</p>

  <p>Ann looked around the circle of faces.</p>

  <p>"You are sure no one let him in?" she persisted.</p>

  <p>"No, miss," said the cook, interpreting the silence. "No one."</p>

  <p>"Well, thanks for the sandwiches." Ann opened her case and then remembered
  the scarcity of tobacco. "Does any one smoke?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No, miss," said the cook. "If women didn't smoke, there's be more fags
  for our soldiers and sailors."</p>

  <p>Feeling reproved Ann went out of the kitchen. Apart from her loot her
  visit had been a success. She had established the fact that Stephen had not
  entered through the front entrance, while James had told her that the
  tower-door was locked. Therefore, the signature on the register was proved to
  be a forgery.</p>

  <p>Although she was not fanciful, suddenly she saw a picture of herself
  carrying a lighted candle out into a windy night. At any moment the flame
  might be beaten out by a gust; but as long as the flicker endured, she could
  still hope on.</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">She told herself that everything hung, on the time element.
  Fortunately Kitty had demanded bridge and some good rubbers could hold the
  party together until midnight. Crossing the hall to listen outside the
  library door, she was further encouraged by the silence. As she was turning
  away she was startled by Isabella's voice:</p>

  <p>"Ann."</p>

  <p>Ann had forgotten Isabella since the scene in the drawing-room; but when
  she considered the peculiar horror of John's charge she expected the guilty
  wife to be broken by disgrace. Yet&mdash;instead of stealing away into the
  darkness&mdash;Isabella had used the time to repair both her appearance and
  her nerves. As she leaned against the door&mdash;an arm stretched above her
  head&mdash;she looked beautiful and completely composed.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you gone?" asked Ann bluntly.</p>

  <p>"How?" Isabella's voice was cool. "John's probably pinched the car.
  Besides, the longer he has to wait for me, the more steamed-up he'll be. Do
  him good. Really, Ann, I must apologise to you. It's too bad of him to get
  tight and throw a scene."</p>

  <p>Ann opened her lips angrily, only to close them again. She was well served
  by her self-control; although she wanted to blaze away at Isabella, she
  realised that a high-explosive scene between two women might be good dramatic
  fireworks, but would not be helpful.</p>

  <p>"It must be nice to feel so sure of yourself," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"No competition. John's only girl-friend is a newspaper tough with a
  Scotch conscience. I'm not afraid of an affair with her."</p>

  <p>Isabella missed the sudden gleam in Ann's eye as she decided that Janie
  would be certain to swing the events of the night to her advantage, since it
  included John's future happiness.</p>

  <p>"Why did you call me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I was going to warn you to say nothing to Big Ben about John's
  performance in the drawing-room. They are seasonal and don't mean a
  thing...But I see now I've been playing you too low. You won't tell him."</p>

  <p>"Why should I? It's not my affair. I'm merely wondering where you left
  your car."</p>

  <p>"In the garage&mdash;just inside the main-entrance gates. You wouldn't
  notice it in the black-out."</p>

  <p>"Then how will you get back to London if John's taken it?"</p>

  <p>"One of the locals&mdash;Peacock or Blake&mdash;will give me a lift to the
  tube terminus. You too&mdash;although I wouldn't advise <i>you</i> to
  stay."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>Isabella did not reply at once. As she looked at the girl a change swept
  over her face. Her shallow eyes seemed to reflect some furtive horror from
  which she shrank.</p>

  <p>"I'm older than you, Ann," she said in a low voice. "Three years. In
  another three years I shall be thirty, so I've reached an age when every year
  counts. But you're still a babe in experience. Do take my advice and don't
  interfere."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Don't get up against Richard. Don't try to raise him. You will see his
  hand only too soon...Coming in to bridge?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Isabella pushed open the library door while Ann ran up the staircase. As
  she mounted she was reminded of some lines of classic nonsense.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"As I was going up the stair,<br>
  I met a man who wasn't there..."</p><br>

  <p>She too was haunted by "a man who wasn't there." In addition she was badly
  shaken by Isabella's warning. When she burst into the tower-room and saw
  Richard bending over the register, she had an impulse to run away.</p>

  <p>"Seen this?" he asked. "I am afraid your visit to the Zoo has cost you
  more than a tanner. You seem to have missed Friend Stephen."</p>

  <p>She made a pretence of examining the signature while her heart beat
  faster.</p>

  <p>"Is it genuine?" she asked. "I remember you told him it would be easy to
  forge."</p>

  <p>"My dear Ann, you have the memory of a mud-dredger," he remarked with
  characteristic offensive comparison. "Sit down and chat about old times. Have
  a spot of whisky. Genuine Old Black Market."</p>

  <p>Ann refused the drink while she took a cigarette. As she smoked it slowly
  she reminded herself that every minute she remained in the room was gain. She
  had to hold Richard's attention and make him forget that she was an unwelcome
  guest.</p>

  <p>As though he could read her thoughts, he spoke:</p>

  <p>"What a one-man girl you are. So you mean to wait up here until the party
  breaks up. For your information, the time will depend on Kitty Blake. If the
  Peacocks left the Blakes would stay on, but when our Kitty makes a move,
  every one goes. She's definitely meretricious but she does possess a certain
  vitality and animal magnetism."</p>

  <p>Ann tried to smile as she looked at his dark seamed face.</p>

  <p>"And now," she said, "I suppose you are going to cheer me up by telling me
  she is an early bird."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, my dear. Any excuse to stay away from her own family.
  Besides it is policy for her to suck up to the old boy, with all this sitting
  up at night to nurse the cubs. Nothing I could not do better&mdash;only I am
  not a mother. She doesn't do it for love or counters. She's down in his Will
  for a fat legacy."</p>

  <p>"You mean, that leaves less for the heir?"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't notice it." Richard laughed scornfully. "A windfall to her is
  chicken-feed to me. I shall inherit a seven-figure fortune soon."</p>

  <p>"Soon?"</p>

  <p>"Sooner than that. You saw my uncle's face when he heard about John and
  the lions. I thought he was going to throw a fit. How do you think he'll
  stand up to losing the entire Zoo?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he won't." Ann spoke absently. As she stared into the steady glow
  of the fire she frowned in sudden doubt. "Richard," she said abruptly, "it's
  plain I am unwelcome. If you didn't want the reunion why did you open the
  tower-door?"</p>

  <p>"I told you that before. I did it on the chance of meeting you. The girls
  were both jealous of you because the chaps were crazy about you."</p>

  <p>"I was a lump of sixteen," said Ann sceptically.</p>

  <p>"Girls of sixteen are women in some parts of the globe. You were developed
  too. It used to give me a kick to reflect 'That kid knows the finer points of
  dee-tees.' But no one could guess it from your face. You used to sit and
  stare at Stephen with saucer eyes&mdash;just like dear Kitty must have looked
  when she was snaring her professor. I was attracted by your reserve and your
  experience. Living with your old man must have been Zola with the
  trimmings."</p>

  <p>Ann's colour rose with anger.</p>

  <p>"How dare you talk of Mark as if he was a common soak?" she demanded. "He
  had the loveliest nature and he was always a fine engineer."</p>

  <p>"Pipe down. If you like them that way, why not? But since we are talking
  about the past, I'll tell you something which may amuse you. After our
  farewell meeting, Stephen came back when the rest of you had cleared out and
  told me not to make a pass at you. The idea was he wanted to marry you when
  you were older. Naturally it put me on my mettle, but you faded out, so the
  matter never came up again."</p>

  <p>As Ann listened the story explained her bitterest memory. After John sat
  beside her in the local bus, she still cherished a hope that Stephen might
  arrange to meet her again when they said "Good-bye" at Piccadilly Underground
  Station. However, instead of travelling back to London with the party,
  directly they reached the tube terminus he sprang out and boarded the
  Yellow-forge bus. She remembered John's remark:</p>

  <p>"Maybe missed his wallet and thinks Richard pinched it."</p>

  <p>"Stephen cared for me," she exulted. "It wasn't only I. It was both of
  us."</p>

  <p>Even as she thrilled with belated happiness Richard clarified the
  situation.</p>

  <p>"You and Stephen seem fated to miss each other in 'Evangeline' tradition.
  It's happened again to-night. In case you think I forged that signature I'll
  show you an old chit he sent me about a specimen-slide. I always keep copies
  of people's handwriting, on principle...Here it is. For Madame's comparison,
  please."</p>

  <p>He opened a drawer at one end of the table and, after flicking through a
  bundle of papers, he picked out a creased letter stamped with the college
  address. It was signed "Stephen Pardon" and the Christian name was identical
  with the handwriting upon the register.</p>

  <p>Ann looked at it closely before she spoke.</p>

  <p>"How did he get up here? The maids say the front door bell never
  rang."</p>

  <p>"Then he probably knocked at the back and bribed one of those village kids
  we are forced to employ to show him up the servants' stair....suppose now you
  have no object for staying on?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Good. Give me a ring some time."</p>

  <p>"Never." Ann walked to the door where she halted. "Richard," she said in a
  low steady voice, "I know you despise the truth, but I believe you <i>are</i>
  telling it now. You want me to know how much I've missed. You want to be
  hurtful...Well, all I have to say is 'Thank you.' I used to doubt myself
  sometimes&mdash;wonder if I wasn't just a silly hysterical girl. But now I
  <i>know</i> I'm justified in everything because he feels the same for
  me."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do about it?" asked Richard.</p>

  <p>"Find him&mdash;if I have to rake through every Record office."</p>

  <p>"My poor fool, I doubt if he is in one of the Services. His line was
  research. He's probably tucked away among the anonymous brains who are
  inventing the secret weapon to win the war."</p>

  <p>"Good. I'll find him."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you will&mdash;if you are alive. Nowadays life is so
  uncertain."</p>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">She recognised the implied threat as she turned down the
  narrow passage which connected with the grand staircase. As she reached the
  landing she heard the patter of footsteps and a girl bolted into the
  guest-room where Lady Peacock had parked her coat. It was the young housemaid
  whom she had bribed with cigarettes.</p>

  <p>"Just popping in to see if her ladyship has left something under the
  plate," explained the girl, grinning guiltily at Ann. "Yes&mdash;good old
  girl."</p>

  <p>She fished up a coin from the toilet-table, kissed it and twisted it in
  the top of her stocking.</p>

  <p>"My luck's something chronic," she confided. "I heard the other bloke
  scratching at the back door when I was in the scullery. He was in a chronic
  hurry. I showed him the back stairs and he was up in Richard's room and out
  again before I got up myself. He was swearing something chronic."</p>

  <p>"What did he say?" asked Ann breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Asked where the folks was. I said out and he said hell, he couldn't wait
  but he'd try to come back. He was in and out in two shakes of a lamb's
  tail."</p>

  <p>"What uniform did he wear?"</p>

  <p>"He was in civvies and all mucky. And his knees were torn, like as he'd
  been climbing walls." At the sound of a shrill call the girl stopped and
  cupped her lips. "Coming," she yelled. "Oh, miss, I couldn't let out about
  smoking before that old bitch&mdash;Oh, thank you, miss."</p>

  <p>The story left Ann shaken and almost dizzy. Someone had actually see
  Stephen&mdash;spoken to him&mdash;heard his voice. She wanted to hang on to
  this witness who was a link between them, but the girl snatched a cigarette
  and fled.</p>

  <p>Left alone she went over the points of the story. It seemed probable that
  Stephen had dashed away from some factory or laboratory, intending to stay
  just long enough to arrange a future meeting. The danger was that he would
  not realise the importance of a first-hand contact.</p>

  <p>"If he can't get away again to-night, he'll ring up Richard and ask for my
  address," she reasoned. "Richard will tell him I didn't give it&mdash;and we
  shall be lost to each other again."</p>

  <p>It was a jolt to learn that Stephen was not in any regiment, when she
  might have exploited her famous nuisance-value. In the circumstances, all she
  could do was to hang on until midnight.</p>

  <p>It took courage to face Richard when he joined her in the gallery.</p>

  <p>"Going?" he asked smoothly, accompanying her down the stairs. "Allow me to
  escort Madame to the cloakroom."</p>

  <p>"Bear up." She forced a laugh. "I'm staying on. Stephen <i>might</i> come
  back. Sorry, but I've got used to being thick-skinned. When they saw me
  coming all the shipping office clerks used to say, 'Here's Trouble back
  again.'"</p>

  <p>As Richard made no comment Ann looked at him uneasily. His eyes were
  concealed by his heavy lids&mdash;which reminded her vaguely of lead-hued
  pottery. He was wearing what John had described as his "hooded" look. It
  still had power to alarm her and she started when he spoke in his softest
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Since you are here&mdash;as my uncle's guest&mdash;I must entertain you.
  Would you like to see the new Saurian Lounge? Lizards to you."</p>

  <p>It was the last place she wanted to visit in his company but she dared not
  refuse.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean crocodiles?" she asked. "Frankly they're no novelty to
  me."</p>

  <p>"Of course not. I suppose you used to feed the pretty pets?"</p>

  <p>"I did. At least, I used to chuck scraps in the river. I swanked they
  wouldn't touch me if I fell in, but I was jolly careful not to test my
  pals."</p>

  <p>"Ann, you are amazing. Can anything ruffle you?...Now why don't you chuck
  Stephen and take me on?"</p>

  <p>To her surprise and dismay she recognised the note of sincerity in his
  voice. He appeared actually human and no longer outside nature. As she was
  often the only woman in a camp, she had received proposals of marriage from
  uncongenial men and had always stamped out their hopes ruthlessly; but
  instinct told her that it was as dangerous to repulse Richard as to try and
  crush the head of a poisonous snake with dance-sandals. Determined to be
  honest, however, she tried to soften her words with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Thanks. If I wanted to be insulted every hour of every day, I would say,
  'Yes, thank you, master.'"</p>

  <p>"Think it over."</p>

  <p>"No. I am sorry."</p>

  <p>"Certainly you <i>will</i> be sorry. I offered you a partnership. Since
  you are not with me, you are now merely one of the crowd. I warn you, I use
  every one. I may use you."</p>

  <p>"Not against my will."</p>

  <p>"But against your knowledge. When I use you, you will not be in a position
  to know it or protest...Suppose we go?"</p>

  <p>"I'll get my coat," she said recklessly, only eager to end the
  episode.</p>

  <p>"It won't be needed," Richard told her. "This way."</p>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">Crossing the hall he opened the door she had mistaken for
  that of the kitchen. Snapping on the light he enabled her to see the length
  of a long narrow passage, with dampish rubber flooring and dark-green painted
  metal walls.</p>

  <p>As she followed Richard, the air grew more suggestive of steam-heating,
  reminding her of a prospecting trip in the Tropics. The scheme had been
  abandoned on account of the difficulties, but not before every one went down
  with fever. It might have been the circumstances which made Ann hate the
  fierce passion of growth which the sun drew out of corrupting
  undergrowth&mdash;the beauty hiding the slime&mdash;the creeping horror of
  life, both animal and vegetable.</p>

  <p>Earlier in the evening she had felt uneasy at the distant thunder of a
  lion's roar and grateful for the distance which divided the house from the
  Zoo. Now at the inauspicious moment, after a clash with Richard, she learned
  that the reptile-house was only the length of a passage away.</p>

  <p>"It smells rather like a greenhouse," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," explained Richard. "We have a marvellous conservatory&mdash;a
  sort of Kew affair, only better&mdash;attached to the house. The crocs used
  to be there, but in spite of protective grating, lovers never lingered there.
  Their pool was too cramped, so Big Ben built them a new tank. A consignment
  of tropical monkeys and birds are due here&mdash;and they don't mix with
  crocs."</p>

  <p>"I should like to see the conservatory," said Ann eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you there after you've called on David. Needless to say, there
  was also a 'Jonathan,' but David slaughtered his pal. Don't mention it to my
  uncle and change the subject if it crops up. Now that David can offer her a
  home such as her father accustomed her to, he is going to have a lady-friend
  in exchange for Jonathan. Touched by my simple Nature story?"</p>

  <p>"I expect you are pulling my leg," said Ann, trying to treat the subject
  lightly. Although Richard had told her an apparently straight yarn, she had
  an uneasy sense of some evil underlying purpose. Every nerve quivered as he
  remarked casually, "We have the big snakes on the other side of the
  conservatory."</p>

  <p>"Then the conservatory's definitely off," she said. "I loathe snakes."</p>

  <p>"And I adore them." Richard stopped and leaned against the passage wall.
  "The old man will let no one handle them but himself. Stinking jealousy plus
  putrid vanity."</p>

  <p>"Well, it beats me why any one should want to handle them."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you can't understand the exquisite thrill of their contact. They seem
  to be plucking at every nerve and spreading a glorious sensation through you
  in wave upon wave. And then&mdash;suddenly&mdash;the pressure tightens. You
  feel a throb of exultation at the call on your resistance. You exert all your
  strength&mdash;you struggle with them&mdash;you conquer them. It's power.
  <i>Power</i>."</p>

  <p>His voice rose in a crack and the muscles of his face worked in his
  violent excitement. As he drew the back of his hand across his beaded
  forehead, Ann felt suddenly sorry for him. She wished she could draw near
  enough to him to let him share her own soundness and sanity; and because
  Stephen always laughed, she tried to do the same.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand your craving for power," she said. "Personally, I'd
  swop all the power in the world for a firm touch with a mango."</p>

  <p>He took no notice of her words as he looked at her with a crafty
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Confidentially," he said softly, "I have a second key to the snake-house.
  The old man thinks he can keep me out. But I control every situation and
  every door is open to me."</p>

  <p>His boast increased Ann's uneasiness as they turned at right-angles into a
  shorter passage and afterwards into a second long passage, where Richard
  paused.</p>

  <p>"I must go in alone," he said. "There's no protection for the public. They
  watch through the grating. Wait and I will put on the light."</p>

  <p>"Won't it be seen?" protested Ann feebly.</p>

  <p>"No. The glass is painted green and the sliding-roof is closed at night.
  Stay here."</p>

  <p>He unbolted an iron panel and disappeared through the aperture. As she
  waited alone, Ann began to feel limp from the stifling humidity of equatorial
  heat. The floor of the passage was wet and the walls were streaming, while
  the odour of musk mingled with a strong heavy perfume. Suddenly she quivered
  with fear as she realised that Richard could play a lethal trick upon
  herself; if he freed a giant snake, she would have no chance of escape in the
  restricted space.</p>

  <p>As she turned to run a faint light glowed on the other side of the wall,
  and she looked through the grating down on an enormous tank. In an attempt to
  reproduce natural surroundings, its edges were hidden by coarse
  vegetation&mdash;feathery rushes, small yellow marsh-lilies and plantain
  leaves which gleamed like wet green enamel plates. It was a tolerably
  realistic imitation of an African swamp except that the water reflected a
  pale gleam of artificial light instead of the furnace of the sun.</p>

  <p>"Where's David?" she called.</p>

  <p>The next second Richard appeared within her range of sight as he climbed
  some iron steps leading to a platform.</p>

  <p>"Look out. I'm going to bait him," he shouted, flinging a lump of
  repulsive meat into the pool.</p>

  <p>Instantly there was a rush as of a submerged torpedo across the
  tank&mdash;a swirl of yellow-brown water&mdash;a snap of enormous jaws. Ann
  had a fractional glimpse of the head of a huge crocodile before it sank down
  into the shadowed mud with its prey.</p>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">The light went out and Richard joined her in the
  passage.</p>

  <p>"Impressed?" he asked. "Of course, David would have put up a better show
  if you had swum with him in his pool. You boast of being matey with
  crocs."</p>

  <p>Ann laughed in relief as she realised that she had terrified herself with
  morbid fancies. There had been no personal risk and no protracted ordeal.
  Unlike his uncle, Richard had done the job and was leading the way back.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Blake vows you'd like to feed your visitors to the lions," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"You flatter yourself. I might feed the crocodiles but I would not risk
  the lions. They're particular about what they eat."</p>

  <p>The characteristic insult told her that Richard was his normal self and no
  longer to be feared for that soft insincerity which might cloak a dark
  design. As they turned the last right-angled corner, the air was so much
  cooler that she felt refreshed. When they reached the hall Richard looked
  around him.</p>

  <p>"Where is the lady in distress?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"If you mean Isabella, she's in the library," said Ann.</p>

  <p>"Amusing little domestic comedy. Hats off to you, you packed the inebriate
  off very neatly. Force of practice, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"No, Richard, it was hateful. No man deserves that sort of deal."</p>

  <p>"The fool likes it. He asked for it and he'll have to put up with it. He's
  her meal-ticket and she'll never let him go."</p>

  <p>Once again Ann's secret knowledge of Janie gave her not only comfort but a
  sense of triumph. Even a cat&mdash;playing with a mouse&mdash;can
  miscalculate the margin of safety and let its victim crawl too near to its
  hole. While Richard and Isabella believed that John was waiting humbly for
  readmission to his prison, he had already taken the first steps towards
  safety.</p>

  <p>"Are they playing bridge in the library?" asked Richard.</p>

  <p>"They were when I left them," said Ann.</p>

  <p>"That looks definitely hopeful for you. When Kitty is well set, only one
  thing could draw her from the card-table. A telephone message to say one of
  her children was ill."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he winked at Ann. Accepting his challenge she deliberately
  returned his wink.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it could be contrived," she said. "Of course, I should know what to
  do about it."</p>

  <p>"You would advise her to verify the call? Very simple and effective.
  Unfortunately for you that would be impossible. To guard against being
  worried with messages from the college, the professor has arranged only for
  out-going telephone calls."</p>

  <p>"Still I know my story and I shall stick to it," persisted Ann.</p>

  <p>Richard smiled as he took her arm and drew her nearer to the library
  door.</p>

  <p>"Good luck to you," he said. "You'll need it. Listen to that. It sounds as
  though the bridge is finished without any aid from me."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-07"
     id="ch-07"></a>VII. &mdash; SEEING SNAKES</h2>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">IN comparison with the drawing-room the library appeared
  small although its proportions were good. It was one of those courtesy-titled
  rooms which retained its name, to correspond with the bell-indicator in the
  kitchen hall. As a concession to literary pretension there were tall narrow
  shelves of books, most of them legacies from another generation&mdash;English
  classics and Victorian novels, while the new volumes were mainly thrillers
  and books of travel.</p>

  <p>Only one green-shaded lamp was turned on, but Ann got an impression of
  comfort from padded scarlet-leather upholstery and ultra-thick carpet. Her
  next glance confirmed Richard's words that the bridge party had broken up.
  Chairs were pushed back and cards thrown down on the table as the players
  stood engaged in general conversation.</p>

  <p>The cause of the interruption was a visitor&mdash;a woman posed directly
  under the light and thus forming the centre of the group. She was apparently
  in the early thirties, under average height, strongly-built and compact, with
  dark expressionless eyes which showed no upper-lid and a pale full oval face.
  A coat of Russian sables was thrown back to reveal a tight black suit and a
  black turban cap hid every wisp of hair. Ann noticed the war-time luxury of
  silk stockings on her thick legs and also the large single-pearl
  ear-rings.</p>

  <p>"Recognise her?" whispered Richard.</p>

  <p>"She's vaguely familiar," replied Ann. "Someone I don't like. Who is
  she?"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Pybus. The great Dr. Pybus. Victoria to you."</p>

  <p>Ann gasped with astonishment as she recalled the shabby student&mdash;her
  gluttony for text-book knowledge, her glue-pot memory and her amazing
  capacity for work. Although her transformation could be a logical sequel to
  those years of slavery, her rise appeared to be unusually rapid. As she
  glanced at the square-tipped fingers which held a cigarette, she felt a
  backwash of her old antipathy.</p>

  <p>"She looks terribly prosperous," she whispered. "How was it done?"</p>

  <p>"She took the short-cut," grinned Richard.</p>

  <p>"You mean, a man staked her?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I don't mean what you do. You have a corrupt mind, Ann, and it
  refreshes me. And now, as heir to the Ganges fortune, I must do what is
  expected of me."</p>

  <p>Richard swaggered into the circle of light&mdash;his hand
  outstretched.</p>

  <p>"This is indeed unexpected," he said.</p>

  <p>"I am surprised to find myself here," said Victoria in a low, forceful
  voice. "I've just been explaining the circumstances to Sir Benjamin. I was up
  in London for a conference and as I was driving back to St. Albans I
  recognised the gates of Ganges. It seemed a chance to renew our acquaintance,
  especially when one remembers past mutual interests."</p>

  <p>"I am under a debt of gratitude to Dr. Pybus," explained Sir Benjamin. "My
  poor old uncle was her patient."</p>

  <p>"That poor old uncle was a plum in the profession," cut in Richard. "Every
  doctor's Old Age Pension. But our Dr. Pybus was unlucky. She lost him."</p>

  <p>"I consider myself lucky&mdash;or skilful&mdash;to have kept him alive for
  nearly three years," corrected Victoria acidly. "Your great-uncle was
  ninety-eight and less alive than any vegetable organism which shrinks if you
  touch it. He was unable even to register contact."</p>

  <p>"Then there was no reason why he should not have lived on indefinitely if
  he was merely a collection of cells."</p>

  <p>"Certainly it would have paid me better."</p>

  <p>"Frankly," remarked Sir Oswald, "it sounds rather like a case for
  mercy-killing."</p>

  <p>Ann noticed that Lady Peacock's eyes approved the quality of the skins in
  Victoria's coat as she asked a question.</p>

  <p>"Won't you be very late getting to St. Albans, Dr. Pybus?"</p>

  <p>Victoria blew out a mouthful of smoke as she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"In my profession you get used to driving at all hours of the night.
  Especially since the war when so many doctors are called up. I'm rushed from
  morning to night and from night to morning."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you have a partner?" asked Sir Oswald. He added archly, "I
  understand that many doctors find it works well to marry fellow-doctors."</p>

  <p>"It has its points," conceded Victoria. "But I'll never pool the results
  of my years of work until I can find a brain that is equal to my own. Of
  course, I don't claim to be unique. I only say that the average medical
  standard is mediocre."</p>

  <p>Although she was prejudiced against Victoria, Ann acknowledged that her
  tone was too impersonal for vanity. She appeared merely to state a fact. As
  she stood and smoked she seemed to dominate the scene through sheer strength
  and success. There was not a sagging line visible in her face&mdash;not a
  wrinkle in her suit. The thin black arch of her brows and the pale coral-red
  of her small mouth might have been painted with the flawless skill of a
  Japanese artist on an enamel surface.</p>

  <p>From the obscurity of the shadowed background Ann studied the scene. It
  was obvious that Sir Oswald was interested in Victoria while Lady Peacock was
  definitely attracted to her. Probably their attitude was the reason why Kitty
  Blake resented the newcomers who had wiped her off the map. She was no longer
  a social force, decreeing the length of a party&mdash;or a vital bond,
  holding people together. She had not spoken since Ann entered the library but
  stood watching Dr. Pybus with a blend of unwilling respect and hostile
  criticism.</p>

  <p>Isabella, too, was silent as she crouched on the rug before the
  fire&mdash;in a beautiful pose, rigidly held; yet Ann was sure that she was
  listening to Victoria's every word. Sir Benjamin moved about&mdash;restless
  as one of his lions. Apparently Professor Blake was the only person to take
  advantage of the break. He lay back in a deep chair&mdash;a cigar between his
  thick lips and a glass beside him&mdash;absorbed in the enjoyment of the
  moment and his freedom from social obligations.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Richard swooped down on Ann and drew her into the circle of
  light.</p>

  <p>"Victoria, do you remember little Ann?" he asked.</p>

  <p>For the first time Victoria was shaken out of her self-possession as she
  stared aggressively at the girl's vivid face. Although her own meticulous
  neatness reproached Ann's flowing hair and creased suit, her expression
  betrayed her jealousy.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I remember Sherborne," she said grudgingly. "How are you, Ann?
  I thought you had faded from the scene."</p>

  <p>"I've staged a comeback," Ann told her. "May I congratulate you on your
  success, Victoria? You are wonderful."</p>

  <p>"Thanks."</p>

  <p>"Were you girls at school together?" asked Lady Peacock.</p>

  <p>Victoria was displeased at the suggestion of equality.</p>

  <p>"We attended the same lectures at college," she explained coldly before
  she turned to Sir Benjamin.</p>

  <p>"I left my car in your garage," she told him. "If I had known there was
  still no proper drive I doubt whether I should have broken my journey.
  Certainly you don't encourage visitors."</p>

  <p>"I confess I don't," admitted Sir Benjamin. "But I will escort you back to
  the garage. I always take visitors to the main gates so that I can be sure
  that they are locked after them. That is one thing I allow no one to do but
  myself. Richard is only responsible for the small door by the steps."</p>

  <p>"One of the 'boy's' little jobs," explained Richard, twisting his lip.
  Catching Ann's eye, he added, "Now you know."</p>

  <p>Ann understood...</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Once the entrance gates were locked there would be no
  readmittance. The Zoo became a fortress where no one could enter or leave;
  and since she could not expect Stephen to return until nearly
  midnight&mdash;in view of his double journey&mdash;the inference was that he
  would find himself locked out.</p>

  <p>"He may take a short-cut and climb a wall," she reasoned. "He was mad on
  short-cuts and trespassing. It seems hopeless trying to meet him outside. I
  shall have to go with the others and they will insist on driving me to the
  tube terminus. They're all so darned decent."</p>

  <p>Once before she had been swept off to visit the Zoo against her wishes, so
  she had learned to respect the general willpower where herd instinct was
  involved. It stood to reason that every one must do the same thing because it
  was the only correct course.</p>

  <p>As she turned away, making a pretence of examining the books, Sir Benjamin
  joined her.</p>

  <p>"Have you found the 'Alice' books?" he asked eagerly. "I've the 'Jungle'
  books too."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you study books on zoology?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No. Why should I? I talk to the animals. They understand me, for they are
  my brothers. Of course we have books of reference. Richard keeps himself
  up-to-date&mdash;and I keep Richard."</p>

  <p>At the moment Ann felt she understood the source of the warped and
  ingrowing passion for possession which gripped Richard&mdash;but even as she
  pitied him she remembered that his reward would be rich. Then&mdash;as Kitty
  began to show signs of fatal restlessness&mdash;she crossed to her side in
  the hope distracting her attention.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of our Dr. Pybus?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Amazing, isn't she?" commented Kitty, pushing back a fiery curl. "I'm
  betting her hair is cropped like a man's and plastered flat with
  Brilliantine. She could get away with it. She has only 'C-minus' looks, yet
  she makes me feel like a wet string-bag that's begun to unravel. By the way,
  after my frank remarks, I hope she's not a specially dear friend of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>"Anything but that," replied Ann.</p>

  <p>Instantly Kitty pulled the girl down to the arm of her chair.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, darling, and talk. We seem to have something in common. Tell
  me, why do you dislike her? Have you anything on her?"</p>

  <p>"No, merely instinct&mdash;and I've learned to distrust that. I remember a
  terrible little man&mdash;a society scientist who visited our
  camp&mdash;lecturing me on the lessons we could learn from the wild animals
  and primitive tribes. He kept pawing me and saying, 'Always follow your
  instinct.' But if I had, I'd have blacked his eye."</p>

  <p>"Apparently he'd been trying to follow his own instinct," remarked Kitty
  absently.</p>

  <p>She had listened to the anecdote with assumed interest, for her attention
  was gripped by Victoria whom the Peacocks were feeding with questions.</p>

  <p>"Are you staying with friends at St. Albans, Dr. Pybus?" asked Lady
  Peacock.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Victoria, "I am putting up at an hotel."</p>

  <p>"Have you a reservation?" asked Sir Oswald.</p>

  <p>"No. I can always get accommodation&mdash;any place, any time. There's
  always the local equivalent for the Royal Suite which is usually
  unoccupied."</p>

  <p>"How nice to be rich," said Kitty in a high-strained voice.</p>

  <p>"I'm not rich," explained Victoria. "Too many drains. But things are going
  to be altered very soon."</p>

  <p>To Ann's imagination the words sounded like a challenge. She was wondering
  whether they were addressed to any one when she became conscious of Kitty's
  vicious whisper.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm <i>one</i> thing that blessed woman is not. I am a mother. I'm
  going home to my kids."</p>

  <p>Crossing to the card-table she picked up a scoring block.</p>

  <p>"Suppose we add up and settle as best we can," she suggested. "It's
  growing late for family people."</p>

  <p>"My dear," said Sir Oswald, rising from his chair and looking at his
  wife.</p>

  <p>Richard's malicious glance at Ann was a reminder of his claim that Kitty
  had power to break up a party; but even as he grinned, there came an
  unexpected protest as Lady Peacock sat down in her former place at the
  card-table.</p>

  <p>"Suppose we finish our rubber?" she suggested to her host. "All these
  young people seem to have come from the same school. I remember my own school
  reunions. I'm sure they must want to talk over old times in private."</p>

  <p>Ann gratefully registered another reprieve even while she was astonished
  that it was Lady Peacock who connected certain chance encounters with a
  common goal of Ganges. Then&mdash;like the others&mdash;she waited for
  Victoria's decision. Before the doctor spoke, she glanced at her watch and
  compared it with the library clock, as a reminder that her time was
  valuable.</p>

  <p>"Have you still a room in the tower?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Richard, "my den. We all live in dens here, except the
  lions. Shall we go up there?"</p>

  <p>As they crossed the hall Victoria gave a shiver.</p>

  <p>"It's Arctic here," she complained. "Fetch my coat, please."</p>

  <p>When Richard had gone back to the library she stood and gazed fixedly at
  Isabella's bare arms and back.</p>

  <p>"Why are you staring?" asked Isabella petulantly. "Do you see me stretched
  out on the dissecting slab?"</p>

  <p>"I was thinking," remarked Victoria viciously, "that I would like to put
  you into high woollen combinations."</p>

  <p>"Help. I'd rather face death on your operating table."</p>

  <p>"That would depend on the nature of the operation. The chances are
  calculated by statistics. I am always out to beat those chances. When I
  operate I expect my patient to pull through for the sake of my prestige. Ah,
  here's my coat, thank goodness."</p>

  <p>As Victoria walked to meet Richard, Isabella gripped Ann's arm and began
  to hurry up the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Ann," she said rapidly, "I know you've hating me&mdash;because of John.
  But you <i>must</i> believe this. Nothing has ever happened before
  like&mdash;like to-night. When you're in love with a man, as I am in love
  with Richard, you don't belong to yourself. I own I let poor old John
  drift...But now I'm terrified. I'm terrified to my very bones."</p>

  <p>"What of?" asked Ann. "Can't you come into the open? It's all this
  guessing and suspecting that's getting me down."</p>

  <p>"No, I dare not betray Richard. Besides I know nothing for certain.
  To-night, Richard told me to do something. It only seemed a little thing but
  I hate myself for doing it. Ann, I'm in hell. I must be loyal to
  Richard&mdash;but I want to save you. You've done nothing to deserve
  this."</p>

  <p>Isabella's lovely face was so close to Ann's cheek that her hair brushed
  her temples. As she listened to the husky appealing voice, she fell under the
  old spell when Isabella was the brilliant golden girl who had combined beauty
  with genius. She tried to force her former hostility but found her
  accusations blunted as she reminded herself that she had no proof that
  Isabella had lured her husband to risk his life among the lions. The actual
  facts were that she had tried to hold him back and that she had personal
  proof of their tameness, since she was used to enter their cage.</p>

  <p>As they crossed the gallery Isabella again spoke urgently.</p>

  <p>"You <i>must</i> go, Ann. Every minute you stay you're in danger."</p>

  <p>Go? With the tower-room only the length of the passage away? Ann shook her
  head with a smile, even as she noticed that Isabella's beautiful eyes had
  lost their faerie gleam and were haunted with the human misery of any woman
  whose man is threatened.</p>

  <p>"I'm staying on," said Ann. "You know why. Stephen. I've got to meet him
  again. But if you can give me his address or tell me how to get in touch with
  him, I'll go at once. And grateful to go!"</p>

  <p>Isabella shook her head helplessly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know where he is," she admitted. "Neither does Richard. We lost
  touch with him years ago. Only one person could tell you. Victoria. She was
  always crazy about him and she'd get on his trail like a bloodhound. Nothing
  and no one escapes her."</p>

  <p>Ann felt that&mdash;in her turn&mdash;her own eyes must betray her
  desperate anxiety. As they neared the door at the end of the passage,
  Isabella made a last attempt to influence the girl.</p>

  <p>"I know that something terrible will happen to-night," she whispered. "I
  can't expect you to listen to me after what has happened, but remember this.
  Whatever I've done, I am human. Victoria is inhuman."</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">They reached the landing above the dark well of the spiral
  stair. Before them was the empty room&mdash;the fire brilliant in the
  semi-darkness. And because she told herself that there would be a time when
  she would see Stephen in the vacant chair&mdash;and because she associated
  him only with sanity and cheer&mdash;Ann began to laugh.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked Isabella.</p>

  <p>"Victoria. She was frightfully funny over your combinations."</p>

  <p>When Victoria entered the room Ann noticed that her face clouded with
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>"No one here," she complained. "Not much of a compliment to your precious
  reunion, Richard."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, we're a full muster," he told her triumphantly. "Will
  you read the register?"</p>

  <p>Victoria almost snatched the paper from him, only to throw it down on the
  table after a swift glance.</p>

  <p>"Stephen told me he couldn't possibly make it earlier than eleven-thirty,"
  she said. "When did he come?"</p>

  <p>"No one knows when," replied Richard. "Or even <i>how</i>. We assume
  survival on the evidence of his signature. But under the conditions to my
  reunion I invited the dead as well as the quick."</p>

  <p>"Personally, I think he has been quick," murmured Isabella. "Too quick for
  Victoria."</p>

  <p>Victoria took no notice of the remark.</p>

  <p>"Most annoying," she said. "Why can't people realise the value of
  punctuality? I have every minute filled. When I rang him to remind him of
  this reunion date, I arranged the time."</p>

  <p>Although she was conscious of Richard's mockery, Ann broke in eagerly:</p>

  <p>"Victoria, will you please give me Stephen's telephone number?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know it," said Victoria quickly. "My secretary gets all my
  numbers."</p>

  <p>"Then it's in the directory?"</p>

  <p>"No, he's not on the phone. My secretary rings his place of business. I
  cannot tell you what it is&mdash;or where&mdash;as it would amount to
  careless talk. It's very hush-hush, while I've lost touch with you. For all I
  know you may be engaged to a German."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Richard began to assume the character of host&mdash;pulling
  forward the divan and chairs and producing glasses.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he invited, "and have a spot while we hold our inquest over
  the past. The whisky is unfit for human consumption. I can recommend it to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Still the same peculiar humour, Richard," remarked Victoria calmly,
  holding out her glass to be filled first. Then she picked up the register and
  began to read the names aloud.</p>

  <p>"'John.' Pretty boy, but too mobile. No concentration. What's his
  record?"</p>

  <p>"He is Nature's nobleman," remarked Richard. "Always drunk as a lord."</p>

  <p>"He's a brilliant journalist," said Ann quickly.</p>

  <p>"Also my husband," drawled Isabella.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations. I noticed your ring and wondered if it meant
  anything...'James.' I've kept in touch with him. He's done moderately well.
  Are there no candidates for your stable, Richard? Oh, I forgot Ann. What is
  your success-story, Ann?"</p>

  <p>"It's obvious," said Isabella, speaking for Ann. "Our infant has grown
  beautiful. That is every woman's real success, Victoria&mdash;and you know
  it."</p>

  <p>"Oh dear," yawned Victoria. "Are we to degenerate to a discussion of
  features? I prefer organs...And now only our host is left. Any progress to
  report, Richard?"</p>

  <p>Richard spoke harshly from the background:</p>

  <p>"Seven years. My uncle is seven years nearer to his ancestors. And I am
  now his sole heir."</p>

  <p>"Not so good," remarked Victoria. "The death duties will mop up most of
  the estate."</p>

  <p>"You forget the residue. What a residue. And the war cuts both ways. It
  presents me with a chance to make an excellent sale of property."</p>

  <p>No one was impressed by the familiar boast. Victoria did not hide her
  sceptical smile as she drew out her fountain-pen and bent over the
  register.</p>

  <p>"Here's my signature," she said. "And now I suppose the reunion is
  over."</p>

  <p>"<i>No</i>," protested Ann. "Not till twelve. Richard gave us till twelve.
  It's on the card."</p>

  <p>"The credulous Ann thinks Stephen will pay us a second visit," explained
  Richard.</p>

  <p>Ann felt Victoria's eyes playing on her face like black limelight.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that?" she asked. "If you are in touch with Stephen,
  why did you ask for his address? Have you heard from him?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Ann. "Just a hunch."</p>

  <p>"The infant was always a dark horse," chuckled Richard. "The fact is she's
  been going native and can read the future."</p>

  <p>Victoria continued to watch Ann with an impersonal yet concentrated
  expression, as though she were counting the beats of a pulse, or estimating
  the remaining minutes of life. As Ann remembered the tenacity of purpose with
  which Victoria countered opposition, she moved uneasily under the
  scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"She'll get the better of me," she thought. "If she can't, then she'll
  wipe me out. But she'll get Stephen&mdash;somehow."</p>

  <p>Her experience had made her familiar with only one side of the picture.
  She knew why men left home&mdash;but hard-luck stories confided to her over
  campfires had taught her to regard man as the eternal gull.</p>

  <p>Sitting on a cushion in a corner where she could see only the reflected
  glow of the fire upon the walls, she sipped her whisky with a dreamy sense of
  warmth and well-being. It affected her pleasantly and potently, like the
  spirit she was ordered to drink in malarial districts, when the tropical
  landscape appeared a coloured transparency&mdash;seen through a shimmering
  mist of heat&mdash;and nothing appeared to have substance or reality.</p>

  <p>"Look at that little boozer mopping it up," said Richard.</p>

  <p>Victoria stressed her lack of interest by turning to Isabella.</p>

  <p>"You're very silent."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that is another way of saying you are talkative," said
  Isabella.</p>

  <p>"You mean I'm monopolising the conversation. Sorry. I am so used to
  lecturing an audience. At present, in addition to my usual routine, I am
  instructing Civil Defence workers in first aid. Voluntary, of course."</p>

  <p>Victoria put her pen back in her expensive bag and, drawing out her
  mirror, examined the pallor of her enamel-like face. Apparently satisfied
  that there was no need of extra powder, she walked to the door.</p>

  <p>"Before I go, Richard," she said, "I would like to talk to you privately.
  I'm experimenting with venom-serum, so I am interested in snakes. Can you
  show me your collection?"</p>

  <p>As Ann listened a shudder ran through her, as though a myriad-legged
  insect had crawled over her bare arm.</p>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">She wondered fearfully whether Victoria's departure would
  break up the party as she walked down the staircase by the side of Isabella.
  Both girls were thoughtful, but although there was no friendly feeling to
  link them, each felt the pull of a common dislike for Victoria.</p>

  <p>"She's got cold blood," said Isabella suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Ann. "Like a snake."</p>

  <p>Again she shuddered at the thought of that narrow steamy passage which
  connected the hall with the reptile-house. She glanced at its door nervously
  as they crossed the expanse of marble flooring and entered the
  drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Richard said the natives had taught me to read the future," she said. "I
  only wish I knew what would happen in the next hour."</p>

  <p>"Don't," cried Isabella sharply. "Ann, you're shivering. Are you
  cold?"</p>

  <p>"Not outside cold. I'm chilled inside. Shall we sit by the fire?"</p>

  <p>As they stood together on the thick white rug&mdash;now trodden into
  lumps&mdash;Ann noticed that Isabella kept glancing towards the window-recess
  where Richard and Victoria were talking in undertones. She placed a cigarette
  between her lips but her hand was so unsteady that the flame of her lighter
  swayed and went out.</p>

  <p>"Let me," said Ann, supporting her fingers.</p>

  <p>Isabella seemed unconscious of her help.</p>

  <p>"What are they saying?" she asked. "Ann, can't you catch any words?"</p>

  <p>Instead of replying, Ann asked a question. She realised that Isabella was
  strung up to a pitch when her replies would be automatic and might release
  the truth.</p>

  <p>"Isabella," she said softly, "Richard mistook me for you when I first met
  him. I've just remembered what he said. Is anything planned for
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. No. I don't know. Richard never tells the whole."</p>

  <p>"But you've been afraid all the evening. You must know something."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be a fool. Can't you see how it is? Big Ben is throwing away a
  fortune a day. That money is Richard's. There's a meeting to-morrow about the
  Zoo. Sir Oswald frankly wants to buy in that rough land. There's a time-limit
  to his offer. Is that enough for a start? It's all boiling up&mdash;and
  there's only to-night between us and to-morrow."</p>

  <p>There was a tortured gleam in Isabella's wanton eyes as she looked again
  towards the window before she threw her unsmoked cigarette on the fire.</p>

  <p>"And now Victoria is here," she said. "That's the limit."</p>

  <p>"But she's only come to the reunion."</p>

  <p>"Of course, my darling daughter, she's come all this way from the north
  just for a girlish chat...Ann, I know you've been trying to suck my brains.
  This cursed whisky makes me talk. I never could take it...But I will tell you
  this of my own free will. I won't work in with Richard if it means working in
  with <i>her</i>. I draw the line at murder."</p>

  <p>"Whose murder?" asked Ann.</p>

  <p>"Hush. Not before the children. They're coming back."</p>

  <p>Raised voices and bursts of laughter proclaimed that the returning bridge
  players were in high spirits. Kitty was the herald&mdash;her eyes shining as
  she patted her bag.</p>

  <p>"My plunder," she said to Ann. "Whatever you do, never marry a clever man.
  Academically, I mean. They can't commercialise their brains&mdash;and this
  business of life takes money. Sometimes I feel I would do anything for
  money."</p>

  <p>"All the same, I thought you sank rather too low when you robbed the
  baby's money-box," said her husband facetiously.</p>

  <p>His attempt at a joke was a failure for his wife spoke frigidly.</p>

  <p>"Not funny, because I did&mdash;and I've never been the same height since.
  I want to crawl on my belly like a snake...What's the time? The dear doctor
  seems to be saying 'Good-bye.' Personally, I can endure the parting."</p>

  <p>Ann also glanced at the clock with a sense of finality; soon the party
  would be melting away like snow. But instead of speeding his guest Sir
  Benjamin made an unexpected suggestion.</p>

  <p>"You'll be very late getting to St. Albans, Doctor," he said. "Can I
  persuade you to spend the night here?"</p>

  <p>Victoria hesitated in characteristic manner. She opened her bag, took out
  her engagement book and flicked over its pages.</p>

  <p>"It means some adjusting and telephoning," she said. "But I think it might
  be done." She added as an afterthought, "Thanks, I was just going with
  Richard to inspect the snakes. Now I shan't be rushed."</p>

  <p>"We'll all go and see them," said Sir Benjamin.</p>

  <p>Again Arm shuddered with repulsion. Another reprieve had been granted but
  she felt that its price might be heavy. She could not understand, her
  shrinking, since&mdash;in the absence of any dangerous encounters with
  snakes&mdash;she did not fear them. In her experience, they were furtive and
  unassuming creatures who shrank from publicity. If you followed the natives'
  instructions to stand still and close your eyes, when you opened the lids,
  the snake had always disappeared.</p>

  <p>It was the feeling of general menace and the absence of any definite
  pointer to attack which sharpened her senses. She had escaped the blitz of
  1940, when people used to listen for a faint drumming of heels, like muffled
  tap-dancing in the room above&mdash;knowing that it would swell to the
  thunder of the guns. In a similar manner, however, she strained her ears to
  catch any muted growl or faint roar from the distant Zoo.</p>

  <p>Kitty who was still jubilant over her winnings, patted her host's
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You're the man to show them off," she said.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you the big fellers," he said, beaming at her suggestion. "I'm
  the only one who can handle them."</p>

  <p>"Shall I go ahead and dope them?" asked Richard ironically.</p>

  <p>Ann remembered the strong emotion in which he revealed his passion for
  snakes; she glanced at him apprehensively, but with the exception of dilated
  nostrils his expression was normal.</p>

  <p>"Richard hasn't the right grip," went on Sir Benjamin. "His touch annoys
  them. Besides he hasn't the strength to master them. My own muscular
  development is unique."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to test your claim," said Victoria. "Take off your coat."</p>

  <p>As Sir Benjamin stripped off his dinner-jacket, Ann crossed over to Lady
  Peacock who had commandeered the fireside seat.</p>

  <p>"I've only had one small drink," she said. "I didn't think I should see
  snakes."</p>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">"Indeed, no," sympathised Lady Peacock. "What an uncivilised
  evening. I shall be glad to get home to a domestic hearth with three cats on
  the rug."</p>

  <p>"Hasn't this been the usual kind of evening?" asked Ann curiously.</p>

  <p>Lady Peacock frowned thoughtfully as she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied. "To-night, I feel there is something I don't
  understand. And I distrust everything I don't understand."</p>

  <p>"But that must be such a lot of things," said Ann tactlessly.</p>

  <p>"Quite a number," conceded Lady Peacock handsomely. "I don't claim to
  understand anything unless I have experienced it. But I'm used to reunions. I
  hope you young people have enjoyed yours. So often there is
  disappointment."</p>

  <p>"I think you are very clever to have spotted it. It's meant to be a
  secret."</p>

  <p>"They always are. That's why I knew it was a reunion, because no one else
  knew. Besides, how could Dr. Pybus see the gates of Ganges in the black-out,
  unless she was looking out for them? And now I'm afraid Mrs. Blake wants to
  dig us out of our cosy nest."</p>

  <p>Kitty advanced clapping her hands to attract attention. In making an
  effort to recapture her supremacy she was rather overdoing her efforts.</p>

  <p>"Big Ben is ready to do his stuff," she said. "Come, for pity's sake, or
  we shall be here all night. When I do get home, I expect to find my baby has
  grown a moustache."</p>

  <p>"What was Dr. Pybus doing to Sir Benjamin?" asked Lady Peacock.</p>

  <p>"Tossing off an impromptu lecture on anatomy, illustrated by cuts at Big
  Ben. She's damnably clever. My ears didn't want to listen, but my brain
  insisted...Come on."</p>

  <p>When Ann pleaded to be spared the exhibition, she caught hold of her hands
  and dragged her to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Big Ben will be disappointed if you don't show up," she insisted. "He
  loves an audience. There's no danger. We watch him through glass."</p>

  <p>For the sake of moral support Ann remained by Lady Peacock's side as they
  crossed the hall and joined the procession already filing down the narrow
  passage. Instead of following its length, Kitty&mdash;who had run on ahead to
  lead them&mdash;stopped about a third of its way down and opened a door which
  looked like a panel in the painted metallic wall. They entered an enormous
  glass-house, filled with tropical plants and trees, and then walked across a
  broad rubber-paved pathway to a door on its opposite side.</p>

  <p>The lighting was too dim to allow Ann to see much of the
  building&mdash;which seemed to stretch out endlessly on either side, into a
  tangled green distance&mdash;but she caught the gleam of watery surfaces and
  wished she could explore the place. It was built on a colossal scale for
  private ownership and made her understand Richard's anxiety over his uncle's
  expenditure.</p>

  <p>The rest of the party had already passed through the end door and was
  streaming out into a passage which was broader than that on the opposite
  side. Directly facing them was another glass-house. Its panes were misted but
  an expanse had been wiped recently to allow the party to peer into a
  creeper-bound twilight, striped with the trunks of tropical trees. It seemed
  another ambitious attempt to reproduce natural surroundings and was
  sufficiently realistic to make her appreciate Sir Benjamin's daring.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he emerged from the background as a dim white posturing figure.
  He had taken off his coat and trousers&mdash;probably as a concession to the
  prejudices of the snakes&mdash;and wore only a shirt and short pants.
  Although he was overdressed compared with any circus performer, Lady Peacock
  snorted with disgust.</p>

  <p>"Really. Oswald, are you going to allow it? He should not do it before
  girls."</p>

  <p>"I hope you will remember I am a doctor," said Victoria.</p>

  <p>"If it comes to that," said Ann, "I grew used to natives in the buff."</p>

  <p>"Hush."</p>

  <p>The authority in the professor's voice enforced silence and Ann listened
  to his warning with respect.</p>

  <p>"I need not ask you to be perfectly silent, since you all possess
  intelligence and self-control. You know you must neither laugh nor talk.
  Above all, don't cry out if you feel nervous."</p>

  <p>"Can the snakes hear?" asked Lady Peacock in a whisper. "There is glass
  between us."</p>

  <p>"They might be startled by a shrill or loud sound. We dare not expose Sir
  Benjamin to any risk. Safety first."</p>

  <p><i>"Look,"</i> said Isabella in a low throbbing voice.</p>

  <p>Sir Benjamin had finished his stretching exercises and walked up to a
  shadowed corner. He stood on his toes and stretched out his hands as though
  he was straining to pluck fruit. The next second he came back under the
  light, with a huge tree-python draped loosely around his neck&mdash;much as a
  woman wears her fur in hot weather.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to watch," Ann told herself firmly as she stared at Sir
  Benjamin with a fascinated gaze. She did not remove her eyes from him when he
  proceeded to stretch and stroke the reptile&mdash;encouraging it to coil
  around his trunk, his head, his limbs&mdash;in a piece of living drapery. His
  movements were so flexible and rhythmic and his touch so sure that she was
  fascinated by the spectacle.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Kitty gave a horrified gasp...From the far end of the
  snake-house, Richard was forcing his way through a curtain of matted
  creepers. In the dim light his seamed face looked like scorched rind and his
  eyes were blazing with triumph as he grappled with the coils of a large
  boa.</p>

  <p>A woman screamed&mdash;a high shrill shriek which was cut off as sharply
  as a pistol crack.</p>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">Ann shut her eyes tightly so that she might be spared any
  scene or horror but her imagination constructed a tragedy from Kitty's gasps
  of terrified excitement. One of the men was breathing heavily and Lady
  Peacock clicked continually after the fashion of old ladies at a Cinema
  during a war-atrocity newsreel. Then suddenly she heard Kitty's voice
  strangled by a sob.</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank God, that's over. Let's all get back before they come out. I
  want to be spared an affectionate family row."</p>

  <p>Ann opened her eyes and stared at the darkened snake-house.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It was a marvellous thrill," Kitty told her. "Now it's over, I wouldn't
  have missed it. Big Ben just unzipped his snake and hung it on a peg, so to
  speak, and then he wrestled with Richard's snake. It was quite out of
  control. They had a terrific fight. You could see it tightening its coils and
  Richard sweating and biting his lips&mdash;but Big Ben mastered it and got it
  all unwound."</p>

  <p>"The old devil loved every second of it," chuckled the professor. "What a
  humiliation for poor Richard."</p>

  <p>"That reminds me," said Sir Oswald. "<i>Who</i> screamed?"</p>

  <p>As the silence remained unbroken the professor spoke:</p>

  <p>"I propose no inquests. There are five ladies here to share the
  reproach&mdash;if any. Personally, I consider it was very charming and
  feminine. Let's get out of this. Kitty, lead on."</p>

  <p>After they had crossed the large glass-house and were getting near to the
  hall, Ann spoke to him in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"I believe you know who screamed."</p>

  <p>"I do," he told her. "Actually I had to put in some rough work with the
  lady. But she got the idea directly I started to throttle her and she dried
  up immediately. If I tell you who she was, will you keep it a secret?"</p>

  <p>"I swear. After that, I suppose it was your wife?"</p>

  <p>"Wrong. It was the cool professional Dr. Pybus."</p>

  <p>"Victoria? But she wouldn't lose her head...Did she do it on purpose?"</p>

  <p>"That's a question I'm asking myself," said the professor. "But the answer
  doesn't make sense."</p>

     id="ch-08"></a>VIII. &mdash; AMBUSH</h2>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">THE explanation did not satisfy Ann, because she saw no
  reason why the professor should confide in her. She knew that he had not
  drunk enough to be in an expansive mood, while she was a stranger to him. The
  inference was that&mdash;in order to shield someone else&mdash;he was trying
  to put her off the scent and that he had selected purposely the most unlikely
  person.</p>

  <p>"It's got to be an outsider," she reflected. "And he'll tell Victoria, in
  strict confidence, that it was me."</p>

  <p>When they reached the hall she murmured an excuse and ran
  upstairs&mdash;covering three shallow treads at each spring. Although it was
  too early to expect Stephen, she wanted to be alone for a short time, to
  relax and try to clear her brain, lighting a cigarette, she curled up before
  the fire, while she concentrated on the possible source of the scream.</p>

  <p>"It's most likely to have been nerves pure and simple," she told herself.
  "But in that case, why did the professor try to cover up? Of course, it might
  be someone who cares for Richard and only realised his immediate danger. That
  could only be Isabella. Or it might be someone who hates him and who screamed
  purposely to startle the snake. Well, I don't know these people well enough
  to guess who that might be...Or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her face grew graver as she considered the accident from a fresh angle. It
  was possible that Richard was merely incidental to the plot and that, in
  reality, it was directed against Sir Benjamin. In spite of his strength the
  odds were against him, for if the conflict had been a public exhibition,
  nearly every one in the audience would have put his money on the snake.</p>

  <p>Ann frowned as she stubbed out her cigarette and rose to her feet. She
  felt reluctant to go back to the drawing-room but she knew that she must not
  be absent too long, since she would have to return intermittently to the
  tower-room. On her way downstairs she suddenly wearied of the cumulative
  strain of a situation where she was doomed to the fate of a Wandering
  Jew&mdash;upstairs and downstairs and in the tower-room&mdash;while the
  future held no definite promise.</p>

  <p>"He won't come back," she told herself hopelessly.</p>

  <p>Even as she weakened she had a clear vision of the hotel&mdash;its lights
  and its super-luxury&mdash;judged by her unsophisticated standard. At that
  moment she might be lying in a comfortable bed, a telephone beside her and a
  private bath near her. In the morning she could arrange to join one of the
  Services, and, with the youth of the nation in uniform, she was assured of
  companionship and probably romance.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I hadn't come to the reunion," she thought. "To-night's a
  fork."</p>

  <p>She remembered a prospecting trip when they had blazed a trail, only to be
  confused ultimately by an intersection of tracks. At that moment she might be
  following the wrong path. Then she reflected that if someone was marked out
  as victim of a plot&mdash;as a stranger she would be in no danger as long as
  she did not interfere deliberately.</p>

  <p>Directly she entered the drawing-room she was aware of the lack of
  party-spirit. The Peacocks stood over the fire&mdash;the Blakes were seated
  at a gilt table in a corner. Midway between the two was Victoria, reading
  what appeared to be a pamphlet. As she seemed engrossed, and the Blakes were
  talking together in low tones, Ann approached the Peacocks. She noticed that
  Sir Oswald's fine face was flushed while he spoke to his wife with
  emphasis.</p>

  <p>"<i>Nothing</i>. Say nothing. I never explain or justify myself when I am
  attacked."</p>

  <p>"But business integrity is not the same as personal reputation," argued
  his wife. "Sharp practice is allowed and even expected in business. You
  yourself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off as the girl approached and explained the cause of her
  agitation.</p>

  <p>"I know every one thinks <i>I</i> screamed, because of what happened
  before you came. Sir Benjamin had a leopardess in the house&mdash;a not
  uncommon practice according to the Blakes&mdash;but I'm not intimate here. It
  stands to reason that if you hear a savage growl outside the drawing-room
  door, you wonder <i>who</i> is standing outside. Before I could control
  myself I screamed...And again, when we were going through the grounds, I was
  startled by that face right up in the sky. Giraffes look so peculiar."</p>

  <p>"And now," summed up Sir Oswald, "my wife is sensitive of being accused of
  endangering life."</p>

  <p>"But every one must know it wasn't <i>you</i>, Lady Peacock," said Ann.
  "If it was, you'd be first to own up."</p>

  <p>Lady Peacock sucked in the corners of her mouth with gratified pride.</p>

  <p>"It's true," she said, "that I went to a school with a very high
  reputation. I don't say a pupil never told a lie; but I do say no one was
  ever convicted of telling one."</p>

  <p>Then she lowered her voice.</p>

  <p>"Personally, I suspect Mrs. Blake. She is so excitable. Besides, her
  standard is different from mine. While I could never take any advantage at
  cards, she has another code."</p>

  <p>As she glanced across at the professor's wife, Ann had an unpleasant
  experience of the poison generated by a slanderous statement. She remembered
  Richard's remark that Mrs. Blake would inherit a legacy at Sir Benjamin's
  death and she connected it with Kitty's own statement that she would do
  anything for money. Apparently the Blakes had a moderate income to meet
  expensive tastes and the needs of a family. In such circumstances, it was
  possible to understand the strength of a lightning temptation.</p>

  <p>As she looked at her, owing to a trick of the overhanging electric
  candles, Kitty's reflection in the mirror was not attractive. Her face
  appeared drawn and crafty, so that it was easy to believe anything to her
  discredit. Then the professor caught Ann's eye and beckoned to her to join
  them and her doubts faded away.</p>

  <p>"Look at the doctor," whispered Kitty. "She thinks she's
  Malta&mdash;impregnable and splendidly isolated. I bet she's reading
  <i>Susie's Sunshine Stories</i>."</p>

  <p>"Where are the others?" asked Ann.</p>

  <p>"Isabella is probably consoling her Richard," said the professor. "Poor
  old Peacock looks sour. He's quite a humane bloke but all the same, he
  wouldn't object to getting hold of some of Big Ben's property by an Act of
  God."</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Ann recognised a well-known practice known as passing the
  buck. Suddenly she sickened of a situation where the atmosphere was so
  charged with suspicion that it was expedient to walk warily and trust no one.
  She had an uneasy sense of an ambush where danger was disguised by familiar
  trappings and where the next step might release the springs of a trap. Her
  feeling was so destructive to morale that when Sir Benjamin came into the
  drawing-room, she went impulsively to meet him.</p>

  <p>As he smiled bashfully at her, he reminded her of an overgrown schoolboy
  who had sung a solo at his school concert. She knew that he was longing for
  her to mention his performance, since modesty would not allow him to allude
  to it.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations," she said. "I've never seen anything like the way you
  manipulated those coils. They rippled almost like music or flowing
  water."</p>

  <p>"That's sympathy," he explained, his face lighting up with pleasure. "Kaa
  was working in with me. We understand each other and he enjoys my handling
  him...What did you think of the fight?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't watch it."</p>

  <p>"Oh." Sir Benjamin's voice was disappointed. Then his bitter lips relaxed
  in a smile which touched his face with momentary beauty. "I'm glad," he said.
  "It hurts me to conquer a friend. You remember Browning's poem of the man who
  let a horse-thief get away with his favourite mare, rather than have her
  beaten in speed?" His eyes were moist as he quoted, "'You never have loved my
  Pearl.'"</p>

  <p>In contraction of his words, he flushed with gratified vanity when Kitty
  caught his eye and gave him a Nazi salute.</p>

  <p>"<i>Heil</i>," she called. "I never knew you were quite so strong, Big
  Ben. As a wife-beater you'd be a sensation."</p>

  <p>Ann thought rapidly, for she knew that Sir Benjamin was straining to
  listen to Kitty's praise. She distrusted their meeting&mdash;since it was but
  a biological step from a wife to a mother&mdash;and at any moment Mrs. Blake
  might remember her family and insist on going home. Suddenly she thought of a
  refuge where she might hide away from officious offers of escort.</p>

  <p>"Sir Benjamin," she asked, "might I go through that marvellous
  conservatory of yours?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he agreed, "I'll tell Richard to show you round."</p>

  <p>"Please don't. I'd rather explore on my own."</p>

  <p>"No. Someone must go with you. It's my rule."</p>

  <p>"Why? There's no danger, is there?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not." Sir Benjamin spoke harshly. "There is no danger anywhere
  in my Zoo. I protect the public against all risks. Accidents can happen only
  if they deliberately disobey my precautions and then they have only
  themselves to blame...I'll tell Richard."</p>

  <p>Sir Benjamin went out of the room and Ann heard his gong-like voice
  booming out his nephew's name. The Peacock's had joined the Blakes, while
  Victoria&mdash;with a belated sense of her position as a guest&mdash;was
  putting the pamphlet back into her bag. As Sir Benjamin returned to the
  drawing-room Ann stole out into the hall.</p>

  <p>As she hesitated she was startled by a hail of rapid footsteps upon the
  stairs. Isabella was rushing downwards with a reckless speed suggestive of
  panic flight. Her eyes were wild&mdash;her lips parted&mdash;while every look
  and movement expressed urgency and haste. Gripping Ann's arm, she spoke in a
  rapid whisper.</p>

  <p>"Ann, you can save yourself. Say 'Yes' to Richard. It's only for to-night.
  You can break it off to-morrow. Say 'Yes.'...Hush, he's coming."</p>

  <p>Like a silver streak Isabella shot across the hall and disappeared into
  the library, while Ann watched her go with distrustful eyes. Her face wore
  the wary expression of a wild creature that scents a trap. Every instinct of
  self-preservation warned her to steer clear of entanglements, especially as
  it seemed to her that Isabella was trying to rush her into joining some
  conspiracy.</p>

  <p>"I must keep neutral," she reminded herself as Richard appeared on the
  landing. When he reached the hall he bowed to her with stressed humility.</p>

  <p>"At your service," he said. "My uncle has ordered me to show you the
  Tropical House. For your information, the staff is not allowed to receive
  tips."</p>

  <p>Ann managed to force a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Not a hope," she told him. "It's the other way round. I should expect a
  tip from the future lord of the manor. But honestly, Richard, I'd much rather
  wander round alone."</p>

  <p>"Of course you would. Unluckily for you, my poor sap, you are public and
  one of my jobs is to see the public doesn't pinch the flowers."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. I've seen too many orchids growing wild to feel tempted. But I
  suppose you have some choice blooms here. This place must have cost a
  fortune."</p>

  <p>"A fortune to you. Quite a slice out of my inheritance for me. One of my
  odd jobs as 'boy' and zoologist, is to make out the cheques for my uncle to
  sign&mdash;so I know to a hundred what it cost...Remind me to tell you
  something funny about making out cheques...This way, Madam."</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">Richard opened the connecting-door and led the way down the
  narrow dampish passage. Ann followed him with restored confidence, since his
  insult told her he was normal and therefore, unlikely to make any demand or
  request. She forgot Isabella's warning in a thrill of admiration when they
  entered the great glass-house. The lighting was faint and gave her the
  impression that a tropical jungle had broken in and spread out over every
  surface, respecting only the broad central path.</p>

  <p>That wide strip of rubber was civilisation triumphant in the midst of
  Nature's anarchy. There were walls of choked greenery on either side, hung
  with creepers and brilliant flowers, while the floor seemed to be composed of
  shallow tanks or tray, intersected with stone copings. She paused beside a
  blackish pool where dripping green leaves&mdash;the size of small
  umbrellas&mdash;hung over floating yellow lilies.</p>

  <p>"It's like a water-maze," she said.</p>

  <p>"It practically is," explained Richard. "There are flagstones for the
  gardeners to walk on, but it's a damp awkward place for a stroll round. You
  want to see it from above. This way up."</p>

  <p>A narrow spiral stair of green-painted ironwork was almost hidden in
  masses of foliage. The structure swayed slightly as Ann climbed up after
  Richard, winding higher until she reached a small shaky platform from which
  she looked down upon the tree-tops. The giant fronds of a palm spread out
  below her in an emerald fountain, amid thickets of bamboos and a veil of
  fern, so fine that it looked like swirls of green smoke.</p>

  <p>Suddenly her pleasure was flawed by a low-toned remark from Richard.</p>

  <p>"Your lips are like fresh wet cherries."</p>

  <p>"Lipstick," she snapped.</p>

  <p>"I wonder. Are they as cool as they appear? Only one way to find out."</p>

  <p>As he kissed her, Ann raised her hand instinctively. Contrary to Christian
  ethics, it was her custom to return an uninvited kiss with a blow. Yet as she
  looked into the dark gleaming eyes, she was overcome with nausea mingled with
  fear.</p>

  <p>He sucked in a deep breath as her hand dropped limply to her side.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you smack my face?" he challenged her. "The playful way you
  used to biff John."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be a fool," she murmured feebly.</p>

  <p>"Thanks. I know now you really have no use for me. You won't even touch
  me. And I know too exactly where I stand...It's still Stephen with you, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>At that moment Ann could almost see Isabella's beautiful lips and catch a
  faint echo of her plea. "Say 'yes.' You can save yourself."</p>

  <p>"Stephen will always be first," she told Richard, "because he is the only
  one."</p>

  <p>"Good." Although his laugh had an unpleasant neighing note, he spoke in a
  natural voice. "It's a relief to return to the impersonal standpoint where
  people are merely cyphers. Since you'll have nothing closer, come on, Cypher,
  and I'll show you the sights. How much do you weigh?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know I was weighed for the plane but I've forgotten."</p>

  <p>"Never mind. I expect the ironmongery will bear our combined weights. It's
  not often used and it's out of repair. Follow me."</p>

  <p>Ann forgot the incident of the kiss in the excitement of walking over the
  shaky narrow strips of ironwork which encircled the building. There were many
  flights of steps, leading up and down to different levels while many of the
  beauty spots were spanned by frail bridges from which visitors could admire
  the special floral features. She had her first touch of foreboding when the
  steps dropped down to a sluggish brown stream, rather like a very narrow
  canal, whose water was almost covered with blue lilies. Their thick slimy
  stems&mdash;branching under the water and swaying in the slight
  current&mdash;made her feel suddenly suspicious.</p>

  <p>"Are there water-snakes here?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Any animal life is innocuous," Richard assured her. "Use your brain. The
  gardeners come here to do their stuff."</p>

  <p>"But you used to keep crocodiles here."</p>

  <p>"Their pool has a protective grating. Difficult to fall in and impossible
  to get out. Besides, as you saw for yourself, David is in his new house."</p>

  <p>In spite of their reassurance, the words did not carry conviction. Ann
  began to feel a pulse beating in her temple and a familiar rasping of her
  skin. Once again there crept around her the uneasy consciousness of
  encircling danger. She took a cigarette from her case, but before she could
  light it Richard stopped her.</p>

  <p>"Smoking's not allowed. Have some gum. It's a filthy habit, so probably
  you're an addict."</p>

  <p>Ann accepted the packet, grateful to give her jaws some definite work
  which would stop any tendency to chattering teeth. Chewing steadily, she
  listened with keen interest when Richard mentioned Victoria.</p>

  <p>"How old is Victoria?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know her exact age," replied Ann. "But she must be under thirty.
  She's gone fax in a short time."</p>

  <p>"My dear Ann, you are overlooking an important person in the case. Why
  will you always forget <i>me</i>?"</p>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">Richard neighed as he scooped up the thick water with his
  fingers in a dash to catch a minute frog.</p>

  <p>"Here's the inside story," he said. "Discreditable but amusing. A few
  years ago Victoria called at Ganges in very different circumstances. She was
  shabby, poor and dishonest. Told us that she was qualified and had put her
  plate up at Abbotsbury. Then to her surprise and quite by chance, she
  discovered that my senile great-uncle was in a nursing-home there. So she
  produced her certificate and asked Big Ben if she could have him as a private
  patient. He turned her down flat. But he had a monkey-bite which wasn't doing
  too well. Victoria suggested fresh treatment and when the wound healed the
  old boy was so bucked that he had old Uncle packed up in brown paper and
  delivered to clever Dr. Pybus. Very useful financial help when she was
  feeling her way."</p>

  <p>Ann listened absently as she gazed at a belt of pink begonias which
  fringed one border of the stream. The air was hot and heavily drenched with
  perfume which seemed to steam up from the flowers. Although Richard seemed to
  be telling her a straight story, she had an uneasy feeling that soon she
  would feel its sting.</p>

  <p>"Cool but hardly criminal," she said. "Was that all?"</p>

  <p>"Far from it. But do you appreciate Victoria's extraordinary luck in a
  time-bomb of fortuitous circumstances? She came to Ganges at the right moment
  to ask for Great-Uncle and when Big Ben had a monkey-bite. But that was
  nothing compared with the second chapter of coincidences."</p>

  <p>Ann bit upon her gum harder.</p>

  <p>"I'm no longer interested," she said. "I don't like murky tales&mdash;and
  I don't like Victoria. But I think she ought to be here and know what's being
  said."</p>

  <p>"She'll get a chance to defend herself later," sneered Richard. "In the
  dock, or otherwise, according to circumstances. But you're throbbing with
  pure girlish curiosity to hear the rest...Victoria worked hard but the old
  doctor who was there already had the cream of the sick-list. Abbotsbury is an
  old cathedral city and the inhabitants would rather die of a disease which
  killed their ancestors than be cured of a new one by a newcomer. Then to make
  bad luck worse, the old uncle she was living on went and died."</p>

  <p>"That was a bad break for her." Ann tried to force her sympathy. "But it
  was a release for the poor old man. And must dish it out to Sir Benjamin that
  he's getting a real kick out of spending the money. No hoarding for him."</p>

  <p>"Ann, you have a sensitive imagination. As you've hinted, when we got the
  sad news of Great-Uncle's death, we celebrated. When were were both tight.
  Big Ben said Victoria must have a compassionate gift. He ordered me to make
  out the cheque at once, lest he changed his mind. When I asked the amount, he
  started by saying 'One.' Then he kept raising the figure until I&mdash;as the
  heir with a reversionary interest&mdash;staggered from the room at 'Five.' I
  came back with the cheque, the old boy managed to sign it, Victoria paid it
  in and then invested it in a partnership with the leading Abbotsbury doctor.
  He was getting old and slack and glad of the extra capital. She's clever and
  a driver and the war's helped her. Now she's tops."</p>

  <p>The silence was broken only by the sound of water&mdash;slow, heavy drops
  falling from a height and the spatter of spray. Then Richard began to
  neigh.</p>

  <p>"Now for the joke," he said. "When the auditors went through our books,
  the next quarter, they asked a conventional question about a cheque for five
  thousand pounds drawn to Victoria Pybus. The old chap went up into the air.
  He'd meant Victoria to have five hundred pounds while I was thinking in
  thousands. I offered to try and get Victoria to repay in instalments, but he
  wouldn't hear of it. Said she'd helped him indirectly to get a six-figure
  fortune&mdash;so good luck to her."</p>

  <p>"It certainly was," agreed Ann uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"And so opportune. Big Ben inherits his fortune and Dr. Pybus gets her
  essential capital. Any one with a dirty mind might wonder if it was a put-up
  job between them."</p>

  <p>As Richard spoke, it seemed to Ann that the gloom of the building was
  deepening to darkness.</p>

  <p>"It couldn't be that," she protested. "Victoria wouldn't kill off her best
  patient for a lump sum of five hundred. That was what your uncle told you to
  make out the cheque for. The five thousand was your mistake."</p>

  <p>"<i>My</i> mistake." Richard cackled. "I told you I control people and
  events. Does it occur to you I could make Victoria's name mud in
  Abbotsbury?"</p>

  <p>"You could prove nothing."</p>

  <p>"But I could raise a hell of a stink if I started a whispering-campaign.
  People who remember my great-uncle would put two and two together. A doctor's
  reputation can't stand smut and Pybus stock would crash."</p>

  <p>"But you couldn't do it without injuring your uncle."</p>

  <p>Before he spoke again Richard churned up the water with his hand so
  vigorously that it grew thick with sediment. The semi-obscured lily
  stems&mdash;twisting in green ropes beneath the clouded surface, as though in
  mimicry of snakish life&mdash;increased Ann's discomfort vaguely. When he
  broke the silence his voice held a note of gloating.</p>

  <p>"As you may have noticed, here at Ganges I am only 'the boy.' 'Do this. Do
  that. Go there.' Now you know the truth. You know that every one is in my
  power."</p>

  <p>The boast made Ann suspect that he was playing on her credulity to impress
  her.</p>

  <p>"You're pulling my leg," she said. "If you really knew any dark secrets,
  you wouldn't spill them to me. Mark&mdash;my father&mdash;said that a
  <i>big</i> man never tells, not even when he's drunk. He said that was the
  test."</p>

  <p>"Then your drunken oracle overlooked one important fact. Some people make
  safe confidants. You are safe, Ann. <i>You won't talk</i>."</p>

  <p>The menace in his voice made Ann realise her mistake. Richard had been
  serious when he claimed moral superiority and he resented her ridicule. She
  tried to introduce a light note as she scrambled to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Gosh, there's a run in my knee from kneeling on these stones. But it's a
  romantic spot and worth a ladder. I suppose it's time to bale out."</p>

  <p>He made no effort to induce her to stay.</p>

  <p>"Kitty Blake will welcome you," he remarked. "She'll be frothing at the
  mouth to get back to her family. She's such a womanly woman."</p>

  <p>His words reminded Ann of the peril. Every minute that she could remain in
  hiding brought her so much nearer to reunion with Stephen. And then she
  realised that she shrank from returning to the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to meet Victoria just yet," she said. "I shall keep thinking
  of what you've said about her and wondering if it is true. If it
  is&mdash;Victoria is a <i>murderess</i>."</p>

  <p>"Nothing to her. Merely a medical incident. The old man was just another
  guinea-pig."</p>

  <p>"That's what makes it so horrible. I could almost forgive her if it was a
  mercy-killing, or even to help science. But a cold-blooded killing for money
  is utterly repulsive."</p>

  <p>"Forget her...If you want to make the grand tour of the Tropical House,
  you've still some way to go. Do you prefer to stay on the floor-level? It's
  damp and the place looks merely like a super-conservatory. But viewed from
  above, it's a masterpiece of trickery."</p>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">Ann appreciated Richard's claim after she had climbed behind
  him up another spiral stair on the opposite side of the building. It was even
  shakier than the first and more densely shaded with creepers which hung down
  in matted curtains. When she looked through them she could imagine she was
  back in an African jungle. Seen from a comparative height, the brown stream
  looked like a sluggish river instead of a shallow trough of artificial water.
  She missed only the quivering sheet of mosquitoes, hanging over the surface
  like a mesh of copper gauze.</p>

  <p>Every artifice of the Japanese landscape-gardener had been exploited to
  conceal the limitations of space. Narrow strips of crazy-pavement skirted
  ponds&mdash;only to be blocked by flowering shrubs or clumps of bamboo.
  Misted by the dim glow of the diffused lighting, the place resembled a
  tropical swamp, where the foliage of giant palms stood out in magnified black
  silhouettes against the bluish haze. Trees dripped their branches over a maze
  of pools and lilies glimmered palely amid a green gloom.</p>

  <p>Ann forgot her own problem in delighted wonder.</p>

  <p>"I can believe I'm back in the Tropics," she exclaimed. "Only there are no
  bugs or filthy rotten smells."</p>

  <p>"Apparently Madame is satisfied with our poor efforts to entertain her,"
  remarked Richard.</p>

  <p>He seemed unduly exhilarated by her praise which he accepted as a personal
  tribute. She could almost imagine that he crackled with the violent
  excitement which was a feature of his character. When he chanced to touch
  her, she had a feeling that he was shaken by the pressure of overdriven
  emotions.</p>

  <p>"Wait until you've seen the central fountain," he said. "Big Ben's supreme
  contribution to the nation's Art. It's in the same class as the Albert
  Memorial."</p>

  <p>A little farther on he stopped before a clearing in the foliage where the
  creepers had been trained back as though to frame a window. Below them rose
  the fountain&mdash;a massive erection of black and white marble. At spaced
  intervals around the basin were four elephants whose trunks were upraised as
  though in salute.</p>

  <p>"Wait till I turn on the water," said Richard.</p>

  <p>When she was left alone she could hear his footsteps clattering over metal
  and feel the strong vibrations of the structure. His desertion made her feel
  nervous and suspicious as each shake quivered through her like a punctured
  nerve. It trembled to a stop after the sound of his feet had died away.</p>

  <p>"I can't trust him," she thought. "Is he going to play some trick upon me?
  <i>What?</i>"</p>

  <p>At that moment there was a curious rushing sound, as of a tropical
  rainstorm, and four shafts of water shot out from the elephants' trunks.
  Finer jets were also released&mdash;crossing and interlacing&mdash;until the
  air was a smother of spray. Bubbles floated on the water in the
  basin&mdash;drops flashed and fell from every leaf. The light flickered on
  the elephants' streaming backs&mdash;simulating the ripple of muscles and
  lending them an illusion of movement.</p>

  <p>While she was watching the display, fresh vibrations through the staging
  told her that Richard was coming back. A few seconds later she heard him
  panting beside her.</p>

  <p>"Just a few drops," he said grandly. "But they are all yours. Ready to
  move on?"</p>

  <p>As she followed him she noticed that there were no steps leading to
  different levels on that side of the building, and that the perforated iron
  walk ran in a straight line parallel with an invisible wall. The trees were
  not only taller and denser but were almost obscured by a tangle of creepers.
  These masses of foliage suggested a kind of Peter Pan hiding-place to
  Ann.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if I could manage to stay in here until it's time to go to the
  tower-room," she thought. "I ought to be back there about a quarter-to-twelve
  and stay there until twelve."</p>

  <p>Suddenly she noticed that Richard had snapped on his pocket torch and was
  flashing it over an orange tree, revealing the golden-green balls of unripe
  fruit.</p>

  <p>"What are you looking for?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he replied. "It's all right."</p>

  <p>The reassurance made her feel uneasy because it was unnecessary. Her heart
  began to beat faster as she pushed aside the branches which now overgrew the
  staging, although she could admit no foundation for fear. Then again Richard
  flashed on his torch&mdash;keeping the beam focused on the branch of a
  muffled tree.</p>

  <p>"See that creeper?" he remarked. "The one like a dangling rope. For a
  moment it had me guessing."</p>

  <p>"Guessing <i>what?</i>"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter." Richard snapped off his torch and began to talk about
  the Tropical House. "I think Big Ben pinched the idea from Kew but, of
  course, he had to go one better than the nation. This side is rather too
  overgrown at present. Can't get labour. I'd like to take you back on the
  ground-level as you'd be able to see the fish ponds. But you would have to
  cross the old crocodile pool and the bridge is not too safe...<i>Ah!</i>"</p>

  <p>As he flashed on his light Ann spoke sharply.</p>

  <p>"You're making me jumpy. I hate not knowing. <i>What</i> are you looking
  for?"</p>

  <p>"I'm merely checking up. Matter of routine."</p>

  <p>"Liar."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, since your girlish curiosity must be satisfied, Big Ben's
  memory is beginning to leak. Thanks to him, I had an amusing experience up
  here last week. I was pushing back these creepers when, suddenly, a creeper
  shot up into the air and made a pass at me. It was a tree-python."</p>

  <p>"How could it get up here?" asked Ann tremulously.</p>

  <p>"Nothing easier. The Snake House is only across the narrow passage, as you
  saw for yourself. Just a matter of forgetting to shut doors. A snake could
  nip in here and lose himself before you could turn round. Of course, Big Ben
  keeps the doors locked...He swore it would never happen again and I don't
  believe it will...<i>Look out!</i>"</p>

  <p>Ann screamed as something damp and heavy&mdash;like a length of rubber
  tubing&mdash;swung towards her and dropped with a dull thud upon her
  shoulder. She screamed again as she felt it stir. Every inch of skin began to
  crawl before she was reassured by Richard's neighing laugh.</p>

  <p>"Sorry. I was holding back a vine and I let it go too soon. Did I startle
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least. I merely thought it was a snake. How much farther have
  we to go?"</p>

  <p>"Nearly there."</p>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">Ann chewed her gum steadily in an effort to calm her nerves.
  So strong was the power of suggestion that her idea of hiding in the Tropical
  House was slain by distrust of the dangling creepers. Although she exposed
  herself to Richard's ridicule, she resolved not to return by the upper
  staging, but to risk a highly-problematic ducking. It was a relief when they
  came clear of the leafy tunnel and stood on a narrow platform which hung over
  a large oval pool.</p>

  <p>Unlike the new Saurian House, there was no attempt to disguise its
  function. It was encircled by a broad grille with curved projecting teeth, so
  that it would be difficult for any one to fall in and impossible for any
  creature to crawl out, even as Richard had claimed. A few steep iron steps
  led down to a narrow metal bridge which spanned the tank. Although it had no
  hand-rail it was only about five feet above the water, so there was no danger
  of vertigo.</p>

  <p>"The public fed the crocs from here," explained Richard. "But, of course,
  Big Ben performed from the bridge. No danger except to the crocs. His bite is
  worse than his bark."</p>

  <p>Ann looked across the pool to where a few steps led temptingly to the
  floor. Farther away, a cloud of spray rising above the greenery, located the
  central fountain.</p>

  <p>"That's my way back," she told Richard. "No more snake-preserves for
  me."</p>

  <p>"I was only fooling you," he said. "Of course there are no snakes. They
  are guarded too preciously. Seriously, I wouldn't advise you to cross the
  pool. The iron is rusting and one step has gone west."</p>

  <p>He pointed to a gap in the narrow stair before he asked her a
  question.</p>

  <p>"Can you swim?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Then you won't drown. And you won't catch cold as the water is warm. But
  I warn you, you won't smell fragrant afterwards. All sorts of things go into
  that pool&mdash;and they don't come out."</p>

  <p>"Then I won't add to the collection. Good-bye, Richard. You take the high
  road and I'll take the low road and I'll be at the entrance door before
  you."</p>

  <p>Ann laughed as she crabbed down the steps and walked lightly across the
  bridge. The Structure appeared to be perfectly firm under her feet, for she
  heard no ominous creak and felt no warning sway. When she reached the middle
  she paused to look down into the muddy depths. The water was unpleasantly
  foul and stagnant, while underneath the grating a shadow seemed to be
  moving...</p>

  <p>Suddenly a tremor ran through her frame. She felt an infinitesimal
  vibration&mdash;faint and remote as the first stir which heralds an
  earthquake...Her response was elemental&mdash;instinctive obedience to the
  signals of panic. Before she realised her action she had covered the
  remaining half of the bridge in a couple of bounds.</p>

  <p>Just as she reached the steps she heard the clang of metal and turned her
  head in time to see the section of the bridge&mdash;where she had been
  standings&mdash;dropping down into the water, like a distant shot of a
  railway accident on a film.</p>

  <p>Her chief feeling was that of guilt, since the damage was due to her
  persistency. Waving to Richard&mdash;who was now cut off from her by the
  malodorous pool&mdash;she began to follow the winding track of
  stepping-stones. It was a fascinating journey, leading her past pools hung
  with maidenhair-fern, where multi-coloured fish glittered in dark clear water
  and bushes bloomed with flowers which looked like butterflies or birds.</p>

  <p>When she reached the central fountain the elephants were still trumpeting
  at full pressure; even though she rushed past them, laughing and ducking her
  head, she did not escape a shower-bath. A few yards farther on she reached
  the brown stream where Richard had poisoned her mind with his story about
  Victoria. She traced the water to its source of a camouflaged drainpipe and
  soon afterwards reached the strip of rubber flooring&mdash;which represented
  civilisation.</p>

  <p>When she heard Richard coming down the iron spiral stair she called to him
  with stressed cheerfulness.</p>

  <p>"I said I'd be in Scotland before you...I'm terribly sorry about that
  little accident."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," he muttered.</p>

  <p>She was struck by the change in him. His eyes were half-hidden by heavy
  lids&mdash;his mouth sagged&mdash;his whole frame seemed drained of energy
  and empty as a blown eggshell. When she contrasted his lethargy with his
  former excitement, she wondered whether he were a victim to drugs.</p>

  <p>"I'm going back," he said tonelessly. He added, as though he had no
  further interest in her, "And you?"</p>

  <p>"Back, too, I suppose."</p>

  <p>She noticed that be turned the key in the lock of the iron panel-door
  before he led the way down the narrow passage, where she shivered after the
  temperature of the Tropical House. When they entered the hall, it appeared
  ultra-civilised after the floral wilderness, even though its effects were
  based mainly upon illusion.</p>

  <p>Apparently Sir Benjamin heard their footsteps crossing the marble flags,
  for he shouted to them to come into the drawing-room. As Ann entered he came
  to meet her.</p>

  <p>"How did you like it?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"The most marvellous place," she replied. "I felt like Mrs. Tarzan up in
  the tree-tops."</p>

  <p>Sir Oswald, who was playing solitaire, looked up from his cards.</p>

  <p>"Did you have much trouble moving the crocodiles to their new house?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," admitted Sir Benjamin, "David threw a scene. As he's apt to be
  quarrelsome when he is upset, we are allowing him a few days on his own and
  to get the feel of the new pool before we shift Jonathan."</p>

  <p>"Jonathan?" queried Sir Oswald.</p>

  <p>"The other crocodile," explained Sir Benjamin. "He is still in the old
  pool."</p>

  <p>Ann remembered the curving teeth of a safety-trap&mdash;the thick dark
  water&mdash;and a moving shadow, as she dropped down into the nearest
  chair.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-09"
     id="ch-09"></a>IX. &mdash; THE MONKEY AND THE SNAKE</h2>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">AFTER the first shock had spent itself Ann's brain grew
  suddenly clear. She realised that she had been mistaken when she suspected
  that an attempt would be made upon Sir Benjamin's life that night. While it
  was certain that Richard intended to murder his uncle, he proposed to do it
  by indirect means.</p>

  <p>In order to destroy Sir Benjamin he had first to destroy the Zoo. Sir
  Benjamin lived solely for his collection of wild animals and he would not
  survive long after the motive power of his life was cut off.</p>

  <p>As she thought over the events of the evening, Ann could appreciate how
  completely the years of frustration had corrupted Richard's mind. James had
  declared that he was sane, but normal&mdash;and she too could detect no
  wavering flame of homicidal mania in his plans. Thinking along the same lines
  as the professor, he shied from the difficulty of getting away with a
  murder&mdash;since he would be the obvious suspect. He recognised the fact
  that a manufactured alibi, by virtue of its nature, was capable of being
  unmade again; moreover, a mishap to his uncle at the Zoo would need the
  co-operation of the animals&mdash;and Ann had proof of three attempts which
  had failed in one evening.</p>

  <p>What made her heart knock unevenly and her skin grow clammy, was the
  knowledge that a run of bad luck could be broken...If he persisted he was
  bound to be successful in the end...</p>

  <p>She did not under-rate the patience and malignant cunning of his
  preliminary scheming. He had begun by making the Zoo unpopular in the
  neighbourhood and infecting the residents with a fear of personal danger.
  Undoubtedly he had liberated the lion&mdash;which had merely forestalled the
  butcher by killing a sheep&mdash;while it was his brain which had seized on
  the imminent amputation of the employee's hand to fake another alleged lion
  incident.</p>

  <p>It seemed to her that scales were peeling from her eyes as she began to
  understand the puzzle of the reunion. Richard had no personal interest in the
  students who were all younger than himself and he was unlikely to concern
  himself with them because he had freakishly fixed a meeting seven years
  before. As regarded herself&mdash;while he could appreciate certain of her
  qualities&mdash;she knew that he asked her to marry him chiefly to score over
  Stephen whom he had always hated.</p>

  <p>With her new clarity of vision, she told herself that Richard did not
  cancel the reunion&mdash;by locking the tower-door and denying admission to
  the "Souls"&mdash;because his guests provided him with a bag of unsuspecting
  victims. One of them was scheduled to die and it did not matter to him who it
  was. The original plan was to intercept one of them with a drugged drink and
  let the elephant act as executioner. Chance had chosen James&mdash;but, to
  even things, he was also saved by an accident.</p>

  <p>For some time, however, Richard believed that James had been killed, so
  since the reunion had served its purpose, it could be rubbed out. According
  he had taken trouble to clear her off the premises and to stop the others
  from entering. This policy was reversed by his initial failure which forced
  him to make other attempts&mdash;hastily planned and carried through with
  impersonal ruthlessness.</p>

  <p>He was flogged on by the time-element, since the morrow's meeting would
  decide that question of renewing the Zoo's licence. There were other
  factors&mdash;Sir Oswald's offer to buy the land, and lastly, Dr. Hogarth's
  advice to find out whether the man, Browning, had been bribed. If a
  conspiracy were proved, only a fatal accident would convince the committee
  that the Zoo was a public danger.</p>

  <p>As she reviewed the events of the evening Ann had to acknowledge that
  Richard had made good his boast of being able to control a situation by using
  people as counters. She had been practically forced to cross the sabotaged
  bridge by his skill in playing on her fear of snakes. A shiver ran through
  her at the memory of his terrible excitement in the Tropical House when he
  thought that a crocodile would play the last trick for him and win the game.
  His collapse afterwards was some indication of the fury which had driven him
  on to murder.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't think of that pool," Ann reasoned. "I've had narrow squeaks
  before and I didn't keep on getting goose-flesh...But he is bound to try
  again. Who will it be? Is it any one here?"</p>

  <p>As she looked around her the scene appeared to her as one of glitter and
  splendour. She had not been back in England long enough to adjust herself to
  civilisation, and her taste was still crude and plastic. The blue-and-white
  drawing-room&mdash;which was copied from a gilt-rimmed teacup&mdash;was
  brilliantly lit and its temperature had lost some of its chill. There was a
  faint blue haze of tobacco smoke hanging in the air and the aroma of good
  cigars.</p>

  <p>It was a new experience to Ann to find herself intimidated by a social
  atmosphere. She realised that she would be up against a wall of prejudice if
  she tried to make these people believe in their danger. Even the fact that
  they wore evening-dress in war-time was proof of an inflexible standard.</p>

  <p>For the first time since her return to the drawing-room, she dared to look
  at Victoria. There was no doubt that her mind was poisoned by Richard's
  story, for the doctor's face repelled her. There was no sign of weakness or
  tenderness in her inscrutable black eyes and her small tight mouth.</p>

  <p>"Did she kill the old man?" she wondered.</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">The professor met her eye and gave her a half-wink although
  he was unconscious of his action. He had been enjoying his host's whisky and
  was in a comfortably expansive mood when he wished merely to establish an
  understanding between himself and a pretty girl. Acting on impulse Ann
  crossed the room and seated herself beside him.</p>

  <p>"I was hoping you'd read my thoughts," he said. "You look very serious. Is
  anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Ann, "I've just escaped a murky end."</p>

  <p>The professor waved his cigar as he smiled at her.</p>

  <p>"Another?" he asked indulgently.</p>

  <p>The fact that he was humouring her warned Ann of a hopeless position but
  she persisted in trying to convince him.</p>

  <p>"It's no joke&mdash;not to me, anyway. I was crossing the narrow bridge
  over the crocodile's pool in the Tropical House, when it collapsed. If I
  hadn't jumped clear, the creature would have pulled me under."</p>

  <p>The professor looked genuinely concerned as he sympathised with her.</p>

  <p>"That was indeed a shock to your nerves. But why did you cross the bridge?
  Surely Richard warned you it was unsafe?"</p>

  <p>"He did," admitted Ann. "But he never told me there was a crocodile there.
  Actually he led me to think the opposite."</p>

  <p>"Then I think I can explain his motive. My wife is like you&mdash;adorable
  but inclined to be fanciful. She and Lady Peacock never cared to walk through
  the Tropical House because they declared they could not forget the
  crocodiles. Probably Richard did not want to spoil your pleasure, so he
  purposely misled you."</p>

  <p>"Can you imagine <i>Richard</i> wishing to spare any one's feelings?"
  asked Ann bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I can imagine him wanting to spare yours." The professor's smiled faded
  as he added, "You must be careful about making loose statements. From the way
  you phrased it any one might think that you were the victim of a fiendish
  plot...But what I don't understand is why Richard did not prevent you from
  crossing the bridge."</p>

  <p>"I jumped down the steps before he could stop me," confessed Ann.</p>

  <p>The professor continued to look at her with approving eyes which did not
  match his voice.</p>

  <p>"You've only just returned to England after an absence of years," he said
  pompously. "Doubtless you've forgotten some of the obligations of our social
  system. You are Sir Benjamin's guest&mdash;and apparently a favoured guest.
  I'm sure you don't wish to repay him with 'careless talk'&mdash;to borrow a
  topical phrase."</p>

  <p>"Of course not." Ann added resentfully, "But why did you tell me about
  your C.I.D. to watch over Sir Benjamin's safety? Were you making a fool of
  me?"</p>

  <p>The professor experienced natural annoyance at being reminded of an
  imprudent remark, made in an emotional mood&mdash;created by the combination
  of starlight and a pretty girl beside him in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"I was pulling your leg," he said. "Very inelegant&mdash;but the truth is
  my wife is inordinately fond of Sir Benjamin which makes her mentally
  unstable where he is concerned. I regard her as repressed merely in the sense
  that she should have had a career, to satisfy that keen brain of hers. So I
  make every allowance for her freaks and even encourage them as outlets."</p>

  <p>"How well you understand women," said Ann who was still smarting from the
  unjust charge of hysteria. "I wonder your wife hasn't murdered you."</p>

  <p>"Apparently she hasn't thought of it. Please don't put the idea in her
  head."</p>

  <p>Ann managed to return his smile before she looked around the room, where
  nearly every one was gathered round a card-table. The exception was Richard
  who was slumped in a deep chair, with an empty glass on the table beside him.
  She noticed that he looked no longer like a bundle of clothes held together
  by the Invisible Man but rather resembled a scarecrow which was coming to
  life. Alarmed by the signs of returning animation, she spoke urgently to the
  professor.</p>

  <p>"Richard doesn't know that I know about the crocs. Please don't put him
  wise."</p>

  <p>"I won't," promised the professor. "And I am glad you agree with me that
  there is a rational explanation of his conduct." He stopped to chuckle.
  "They're playing poker over there," he explained. "For the first time in
  living memory my wife is taking a beating. Confidentially, I am filled with
  unholy joy. I've no card-sense and she always rubs in my mistakes. Now I'm
  going to stand by her, like a devoted husband, presumably to support her but
  really to gloat...Coming?"</p>

  <p>"No, thanks. No money."</p>

  <p>As Ann watched the progress of the game, from a distance, she soon
  discovered that Kitty was being outclassed mainly by Victoria. The doctor's
  expressionless face served her well while her acumen surpassed Kitty's skill.
  Her eyes glittered with triumph which was mixed with malice, since the
  professor's wife was proving a bad loser. Unimpressed by the fortunes of the
  game, Lady Peacock was complaining to Sir Benjamin about a servant's
  insolence.</p>

  <p>"Nothing she actually said. It was her manner. She let me know what she
  was <i>thinking</i>."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what the world is coming to," remarked her host as seriously
  as though he was talking about the war.</p>

  <p>Ann noticed that he had discarded his schoolboy capers and was acting the
  part of a courteous host in his own drawing-room. Then she chanced to meet
  Isabella's eyes. Instantly Isabella stared at her as though challenging her
  to claim any understanding between them.</p>

  <p>"They're all showing me what I'm up against," reflected Ann. "It's
  hopeless."</p>

  <p>Against her will she looked again at Richard and saw that he was rubbing
  the loose skin of his face over his cheekbones as though he were
  concentrating on a train of thought. As she watched him she surprised the
  birth of a smile which spurted up in his eyes but died before his lips could
  relax.</p>

  <p>"He's plotting," she told herself. "He's thought of another trick."</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">In order to appear unconscious of his treachery she crossed
  boldly over to him.</p>

  <p>"Richard," she said. "I feel terrible."</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"Breaking the bridge, of course. I suppose I must come clean about it.
  When's the best time to approach your uncle?"</p>

  <p>"You can leave that to me," said Richard grandly. "It's nothing new. We're
  used to the stinking carelessness of the public...By the way, I've just been
  thinking about the mystery of Stephen's signature. Like to hear what I make
  of it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's obvious that our hero shirked the army and is working in some
  safe area within a reasonable radius. He couldn't get leave for
  to-night&mdash;but he must have taken advantage of a hold-up, or else got
  some mug to carry on for him&mdash;just long enough to dash over and contact
  <i>you</i>. It's plain he was in too great a hurry to wait, but he's not the
  sort of chap to accept total loss...My bet is he's gone back to his factory
  or laboratory and is working at frantic pressure, so as to clear his plate in
  time to show up again before zero-hour...To put it in simple language, to
  suit your intelligence, I think we might expect him about five to twelve. He
  always cut it fine. Do you agree with me?"</p>

  <p>"I agree with everything except your sneer about military service."</p>

  <p>"What's the odds?" Richard did not attempt to hide his yawn. "It's getting
  stuffy in here. As it's verboten to open windows in the black-out, what about
  a spot of fresh air? Shall we go for a short stroll, Ann?"</p>

  <p>"<i>No</i>."</p>

  <p>The voice was so clear that Ann almost believed that the word had been
  actually spoken instead of ringing inside her head. Instantly she connected
  her fancy with her dead father.</p>

  <p>"Mark's warning me not to go."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact no supernatural caution was needed, for she still
  remembered the helpless terror of groping through the darkness with Richard
  in control. Those fears could be duplicated with the difference of reality
  instead of imagination. She pressed her lips firmly together in her
  resolution to resist him&mdash;even while his next words told her that he was
  indulging in his favourite sport of using people as pawns.</p>

  <p>"The modern lover is a cold-blooded fish," he sneered. "If you ever read
  Tennyson, you would know how they used to put themselves through it. But I
  thought <i>you</i> would jump at a chance to meet Stephen."</p>

  <p>"We are not likely to meet him," she said.</p>

  <p>"Why not? I know the exact spot where he'll trespass with his usual
  courteous disregard of private property. In the old days, his lordship was
  too impatient to follow the path through the meadow. If he didn't come with
  the rest of you, he always climbed the wall at the point nearest to the
  house. He's rushed for time to-night, so he'll use his short-cut."</p>

  <p>Aim remembered that the little housemaid had told her that the knees of
  Stephen's trousers were torn. Although the girl's words seemed to confirm
  Richard's forecast, she determined not to be stampeded.</p>

  <p>"I haven't got to protect Stephen," she thought. "If it came to a fight,
  he'd lick the pants off Richard."</p>

  <p>"<i>Afraid</i> to come with me?" asked Richard softly.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she asked. "Last time I went out with you, I found myself in a
  bus, going back to London."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, Ann, that's unworthy of your imagination. Last time, you thought
  I was going to throw you down into the bear-pit. What debased fancies you
  have. If Stephen should meet with an accident, remember <i>you</i> thought of
  it first."</p>

  <p>"I'm not worrying about him. He's a tough guy and he can look after
  himself."</p>

  <p>"Admittedly&mdash;but remember the special circumstances. When he commits
  a felony, he puts himself outside the law. One of our keepers is a regular
  thug, and itching to use his cosh again. He's got to respect the animals
  because <i>they</i> are valuable, but he'd think nothing of putting a human
  to sleep. I've only to hint that someone might be breaking in to-night, at
  such and such a spot, for him to be waiting at the bottom of the wall...And
  if he hit too hard&mdash;remembering the recent accidents at the Zoo&mdash;he
  could avoid the charge of manslaughter by dumping the body in a restricted
  space, occupied by a dangerous beast, and then goading the brute to vent his
  rage on the nearest object...What about that for a theory?"</p>

  <p>Ann began to feel the familiar ice creeping through her veins. Richard's
  tactics reminded her of how the great snake in the Jungle Book hypnotised the
  monkeys&mdash;making them advance towards him although they knew their fate.
  He was hinting at his own murderous intention if she failed to deputise for
  Stephen.</p>

  <p>"He wants to make <i>me</i> come," she thought, "because I'd be easier to
  knock out and lighter to carry&mdash;afterwards. But I won't go. I won't take
  one step towards his trap with my eyes open."</p>

  <p>"Well?" prodded Richard.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't Stephen be rather heavy for you to carry to the Zoo?" she asked
  recklessly.</p>

  <p>"I mentioned the keeper, didn't I? But if ever I was too zealous in
  defending my uncle's property and found myself with a body on my hands, I
  should use a wheelbarrow...Think it over."</p>

  <p>The advice was superfluous for Ann could not control her racing brain. As
  she reviewed the past hours, it seemed impossible to believe that so much
  could have happened since she sat in the hotel, waiting for the time to pass.
  Looking back at it, the lounge appeared a haven of light and cheer&mdash;with
  its drifting crowd to emphasise the truism of "Safety in numbers"&mdash;while
  the reunion was before her, still unspoilt.</p>

  <p>It was only in retrospect that she could estimate how steadily the
  situation had deteriorated. Her first ordeal of travelling in the black-out
  had been crowded out by disappointments and problems connected with the
  tower-room. At the time, she had been strained merely to keep a footing in
  Ganges; and since then, she had felt the horror of personal danger. But even
  this was incomparable with the threat of peril to Stephen.</p>

  <p>She looked up sharply at Richard in time to see a smile flickering over
  his lips.</p>

  <p>"He's just a fourflusher, trying to bluff me," she told herself.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to let me meet Stephen alone?" he asked. "You are very
  trusting. I shall have fun with him. I shall tell him you have grown fat and
  can talk of nothing but your twins. The betting is he'll call the reunion off
  and climb back over his little wall again."</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't believe you," she said. "He's nobody's fool. Besides you
  can't blame me for preferring to stay safe indoors. You must admit this isn't
  the ordinary country-house with lions and unicorns on top of the gates, in
  their proper place. You let yours range loose."</p>

  <p>"Not on your life. There are barricades and enclosures to protect
  <i>them</i> from the public. But even if one managed to slip through, he'd
  keep out of your way."</p>

  <p>The explanation sounded so reasonable that, in other circumstances, Ann
  would have exchanged gladly the confinement of the house for the liberty of
  the grounds. Indoors, she was kept in continual suspense lest the party
  should break up; but if Kitty suddenly decreed its end, they would have to
  wait for her to return to the house before a general exodus of guests.</p>

  <p>"It might be just those extra minutes which might bring Stephen and me
  together," she thought. "Who knows?"</p>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">While she was frowning in doubt, she vaguely noticed that
  Isabella kept looking in her direction. Suddenly she sprang up from the
  poker-table and crossed over to them. Again she ignored Ann but the girl
  believed she understood the reason. Like herself, Isabella had tried to give
  a warning of danger and was smarting with natural resentment at being
  ridiculed.</p>

  <p>"Winning, Isabella?" she asked, trying to appear natural.</p>

  <p>"No one is winning but Victoria," replied Isabella. "She can't lose
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"She hasn't played against <i>me</i> yet," remarked Richard softly.</p>

  <p>Isabella leaned forward across Ann, as though she did not see the girl
  although she lowered her voice instinctively.</p>

  <p>"I saw you with her," she said. "What were you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"This and that," replied Richard. "Just a girlish chat."</p>

  <p>"You're holding out on me."</p>

  <p>"Obviously. My affairs are no business of yours."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I know more about them than you think. She's bucked about
  something and she's in a deadly mood. Sure of herself as if she held all the
  cards...Did she force some sort of ultimatum and did you give in to her?"</p>

  <p>"I did not give in to her. Our conversation ended in deadlock. For your
  information, it will be resumed later."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, to Ann's amazement, Isabella's hard voice softened to a tender
  note. Unlike the professional wheedling of a Circe enchanting swine, it
  betrayed the passionate love of a woman for her man.</p>

  <p>"Call it off, darling. For my sake...If anything happened to you, I
  couldn't take it. Don't see her again. She'll get the better of you."</p>

  <p>"She can try," said Richard. "No one can threaten me and get away with
  it."</p>

  <p>Ann did not doubt his boast as he lowered his heavy lids which always
  reminded her of leaden coffin-lids. They dismayed her especially because she
  was growing uneasy about her decision. She told herself that Isabella was
  trying to shield Richard from danger while she was exposing Stephen to a
  treacherous attack, without going to his aid. The strongest and most
  resourceful man could hardly expect an unknown enemy to strike him down at
  the foot of a wall on the other side of a country road.</p>

  <p>"Big Ben is whispering to you," remarked Richard as Sir Benjamin's
  clock-like voice tolled through the room.</p>

  <p>"Isabella, come back and sit by me. Perhaps you'll bring me luck."</p>

  <p>There was no question of disobeying the command and Isabella went back
  reluctantly to the card-table. When she had gone, Richard lit a cigarette
  before he spoke to Ann.</p>

  <p>"Take your time."</p>

  <p>She knew that she had gone one step forward to an unknown fate, when she
  studied him critically. She had proof of his muscular strength when he
  carried her down the steps and also when he wrestled with the boa&mdash;but
  she did not consider that he looked healthy. His chest was contracted, while
  the unnatural colour of his skin might have resulted from organic
  disease.</p>

  <p>"Is the Zoo a reserved occupation?" she asked.</p>

  <p>His hostile glance told her that he resented the question.</p>

  <p>"If you want to know why I'm not in the army," he said, "it is because my
  uncle believed my brain too valuable to be spattered wholesale by high
  explosive. As lord of the manor, he arranged that the medical board should
  grant me exemption."</p>

  <p>"That means you are physically unfit," translated Ann mentally. "If it
  came to a scrap I might hold my own. It's worth the risk."</p>

  <p>As she considered the chances of Stephen being manhandled for trespassing,
  she began to counter-plot. If she could induce Richard to show her the
  vulnerable part of the wall, where it could be scaled, she might steal out
  later and wait for him to come. In the worse case, she could cry out to warn
  him of an attack&mdash;or if Richard were only bluffing&mdash;she would be
  there to welcome him. That would be journey's end for both of them and their
  real reunion.</p>

  <p>"Even if we find the main gates locked," she thought, "we could climb the
  wall. Stephen should find short-cuts to the tube terminus...Oh, what
  fun."</p>

  <p>The attempt involved a personal risk but she had safeguards&mdash;her
  pocket-torch, abnormally keen hearing and the fact that she was suspicious of
  treachery. Feeling confident that she would be a match for Richard, she tried
  to draw him out.</p>

  <p>"You may like to know you were right about Stephen climbing the wall," she
  said. "That's exactly the way he came. One of your maids told me he knocked
  at the scullery door and she took him up by the back stairs."</p>

  <p>"He's not changed his habits, curse him," remarked Richard. "Whenever he
  climbed the wall he used to come in through the back. It's the direct way up
  to the house, so naturally Lord Stephen never had the elementary manners to
  go round to the tower-door. Light may bend&mdash;but <i>he</i> has to go in a
  straight line."</p>

  <p>Ann snapped at the admission that, if she started out from the back of the
  house and followed her nose downwards, she would reach the wall near the
  point where Stephen used to climb it. Remember his flair for blazing out a
  trail and his dislike of obstacles, she was satisfied that Richard was
  speaking the truth. What disconcerted her was his candour which told her that
  he did not consider her worth the effort of a lie. She was merely one of his
  counters, to be pushed about and then scrapped.</p>

  <p>"For the last time," he said, "are you coming?"</p>

  <p>"Actually, I am," she told him. "It's so morbidly stuffy in here. But I
  insist on carrying my torch. It's humiliating to be led around, when I'm
  white, free and over twenty-one."</p>

  <p>Richard's short laugh was more like a bark of triumph.</p>

  <p>"You may carry a searchlight, if you like," he said. "I'm the A.R.P.
  warden for this outfit and I make my own rules. Just one more little job
  wished on 'the boy' by the patriotic Sir Benjamin Watson."</p>

  <p>It cost Ann an actual effort to commit herself to action as she rose from
  her chair. She was another step nearer to the snake.</p>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">"I must go to the cloakroom and get my coat," she said.</p>

  <p>To her relief, although it was only a temporary shrift, he pushed her back
  again.</p>

  <p>"Better not go out of the room together," he said. "Isabella will make
  something of it and throw a scene. She's edgy to-night. That fool John upset
  her."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," commented Ann acidly. "I understand he is her
  meal-ticket."</p>

  <p>"Ann, you have a mind like the counsel for the prosecution&mdash;all
  daisies and dewdrops. It's your chief attraction...I'll wait on the portico
  just outside the front door. Join me there in ten minutes."</p>

  <p>Although Ann realised that the interval would allow him time to set a
  trap, she welcomed the extra minutes of grace, because there was something
  she had to do. She dared not venture out into the darkness without a
  safeguard. Her father had warned her never to leave her base without
  preparing for an attack. In the safety of the camp she had laughed at
  him&mdash;comparing him with a boy playing at Indians&mdash;but now she was
  going to try out his advice in the English countryside.</p>

  <p>She intended to leave behind her a note for Sir Benjamin and use it to
  force Richard to bring her back unharmed. At the present, her difficulty was
  to get it delivered at exactly the right time.</p>

  <p>"If he gets it too early&mdash;and I come back safely&mdash;he'll be
  furious," she reasoned. "I've written it, so it is a criminal libel."</p>

  <p>She looked around the room, wondering if she could trust it to any of the
  guests. There was a chance of private explanation as the game was being held
  up while Lady Peacock tried to restrain Kitty from plunging further.</p>

  <p>"Cut your losses like I do," she advised.</p>

  <p>"You've hardly lost a bean," said Kitty scornfully. "You've been so
  cautious."</p>

  <p>Lady Peacock defended herself with spirit.</p>

  <p>"I can hold my own at bridge but poker is so peculiar. Too much like
  telling lies for my taste. Besides, I'm proud of being cautious. I'm laughed
  at because I always leave my coat in an upstairs room, but I've known cases
  of valuable furs being stolen from a ground-floor cloakroom. Any one can slip
  in if the door is not quite secure."</p>

  <p>"Cloakroom," thought Ann. "Shall I leave the note there?...No. People are
  coming and going all the time. It would be found too soon."</p>

  <p>Again she looked around her but decided that she could count on no one's
  discretion.</p>

  <p>"If I give it to any one here," she reasoned, "and said, 'Give this to Sir
  Benjamin if I'm not back in half an hour,' they'd suspect a mystery and
  refuse to be mixed up in it. Besides, I couldn't put it past them to peep
  inside. I can't seal it because I've no envelope. If they read that I'm
  accusing Richard of plotting to murder me, they'll be all steamed-up and I'd
  be flung out of Ganges for good and all&mdash;before I could contact
  Stephen...My best bet is to bribe one of the maids to give it to him. They
  don't seem a curious lot in the kitchen. Not enough intelligence."</p>

  <p>She peeled a leaf off a bridge scoring-block and fumbled in her pocket for
  the professor's precious pencil which she had forgotten to return. After
  scrawling a few lines, she folded the paper and printed Sir Benjamin's name
  in large letters outside. Then she strolled over to the poker-table and
  slipped the pencil inside the professor's hand.</p>

  <p>He smiled at her and made a pretence of kissing it before he put it in his
  pocket...Ann watched him&mdash;knowing nothing of the gruesome business in
  which it would be next used...</p>

  <p>As she walked to the door Sir Benjamin roared a question.</p>

  <p>"Is Richard looking after you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied. "We are just going for a stroll."</p>

  <p>"Good. If you feel hungry you'll find 'eats' in the kitchen Frigidaire.
  The maids all go early to bed and it's 'help yourself,' after that."</p>

  <p>Ann was too dashed by the news to notice that Isabella was glaring at her
  with smouldering eyes. When she reached the hall she stood there, racked with
  miserable uncertainty. As she lingered, however, something clicked in her
  brain and her face cleared.</p>

  <p>"I'll put it <i>there</i>," she decided...</p>

  <p>Not long afterwards she opened the front door and looked out into what
  seemed to be a coal mine. As the silence remained unbroken, she whistled
  softly and threw the beam of her torch around. It picked out Richard's
  figure&mdash;motionless and magnified by the night-mist, so that it looked
  like an ebony statue. As he came forward, he gave a contemptuous laugh.</p>

  <p>"I knew you'd come," he said. "What a little fool you are...But since you
  will concern yourself with my business, it's up to you. Come out through the
  back to save time."</p>

  <p>They entered the house and Ann followed Richard across the hall and into
  the kitchen, where the fire was damped-down in proof that the maids had gone
  to bed. After leading her through several domestic offices, he opened a door
  and flashed his torch over a damp red-brick path.</p>

  <p>"The Tropical House and the Reptile House are to the right," he explained.
  "They look like the Albert Hall by daylight. I won't offer my arm, since you
  flinch from my touch, so follow me. It's straight on and downhill all the
  way."</p>

  <p>Before she moved Ann looked up at the sky which, although starlit, was too
  cloudy for steering a course. The Plough was dropping out of sight behind a
  wall of tall trees but she recognised Capella overhead.</p>

  <p>"Something to go on with," she reflected.</p>

  <p>At first they went through a kitchen-garden where she smelt rotten apples
  and dead leaves and saw the blue bloom of a bed of pickling cabbages in the
  light from her torch. The autumnal odours of chrysanthemums and bonfires were
  a pleasant reminder of her home garden at Highgate before went abroad. And
  then, suddenly, her mind slipped back to a muddy pool and a dark shadow
  spreading out below the surface.</p>

  <p>The memory she had crowded out of her mind returned in all its horror. She
  was putting herself in the power of a man who had planned a ghastly
  death...</p>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">For a moment she fought the temptation to rush through the
  garden back to the house. Then Richard opened a rustic gate and she followed
  him with the shrinking fascination of a monkey lured to its fate.</p>

  <p>It was rough going as she stumbled over tufts of coarse meadow-grass and
  caught her feet in ground-briars. The gradient soon became steep and, as they
  dropped lower, she shivered in a pocket of chill air collected in a fold of
  the landscape. Whenever she flashed her torch around her, she saw dwarfed and
  contorted trees of Old England&mdash;oak, ash and thorn&mdash;their trunks
  braced back and their branches wildly outspread, as though they were trying
  to save themselves from sliding down into the hollow.</p>

  <p>Presently Richard broke the uncomfortable silence:</p>

  <p>"The short-cut to Ganges is built up in steps to avoid the steepness of
  the slope," he explained. "Now you had better forget your girlish shrinking
  and take my arm. We've got to go through a covert."</p>

  <p>"I thought you said it was a direct drop down," she objected. "Why are we
  bearing to the right?"</p>

  <p>"You are observant. A regular little girl guide. For your information, we
  have to avoid some trenches which were dug for air shelters and are full of
  water. I don't recommend a dip as there is no steam-heating as in the
  Tropical House pool."</p>

  <p>"Any crocodiles there?"</p>

  <p>The words were no sooner spoken than Ann realised her blunder. She had
  meant to keep Richard ignorant of how much she knew. She could estimate his
  fury at being duped by her professed unconsciousness, from the roughness with
  which he seized her arm. Linked together, they forced a passage through a
  closely-grown grove of bushes and smallish trees. She caught her foot in a
  rabbit hole and was reminded of "Alice in Wonderland," but her sense of
  phantasy swiftly change to a nightmare. Naked twigs tried to poke black
  fingers in her eyes; they swished her face and flogged her shoulders.
  Whenever she stumbled Richard neighed with laughter.</p>

  <p>"Do loose my arm," she cried. "It's like being in a chain-gang."</p>

  <p>"Right," he said nonchalantly, taking away his hand. "Actually we are
  arrived. We are close to Stephen's Lover's Leap."</p>

  <p>Even as he spoke, they came up flush with a wall which was at the bottom
  of a slippery grass bank. Ann glanced at the bushes&mdash;subconsciously
  marking them as future cover&mdash;while all her faculties were suddenly
  strained to meet an attack. Then the silence was broken by a sound of distant
  long-drawn howling.</p>

  <p>"Wolves," said Richard. "They're ranging. Always hungry, even when fed.
  We're close to part of their property."</p>

  <p>He turned and began to climb back up the hill while Ann followed him. As
  she slipped and panted with exertion she tried to get inside his mind. She
  reasoned that he would not be likely to kill her until they reached level
  ground. Otherwise he would be forced to carry a heavy body all the way up the
  hill and into the zoo grounds, for "the finishing touches." He had taken her
  down to the wall, by way of the thicket, so that she might present an
  appearance of having wandered, when lost&mdash;pushing through obstacles in
  the hope of finding her way back, until she climbed unsuspectingly into the
  fatal enclosure.</p>

  <p>She noticed that Richard did not continue his fiction of avoiding
  rain-filled trenches but stuck to a straight line up the hill. It was a
  grilling climb and soon both were out of breath; but Ann knew that it was
  chiefly fear which was pumping her blood and beating in her
  temples&mdash;while Richard was gripped again by the terrible excitement of
  murder.</p>

  <p>"How long is it safe for me to wait?" she wondered, as the slope grew
  easier. Flashing her torch around her, suddenly she felt suffocated by the
  racing of her heart.</p>

  <p>About twenty yards distant, near a gate opening into a wired enclosure,
  stood a large wheelbarrow.</p>

  <p><i>"Now,"</i> she told herself.</p>

  <p>In that moment she realised that she had under-rated her danger. She had
  been counting on an elemental fight where she could use her feet and nails;
  but as she listened to Richard's broken breathing, she knew that his attack
  would be made with sudden and swift treachery&mdash;a wire noose slung over
  her head or pepper in her eyes. Instinctively she put her hands around her
  throat to protect it as she licked her dry lips.</p>

  <p>"Richard," she said. "You say I have a dirty mind. Now that I'm safely
  back, I'll confess I was so suspicious of you that I left a note behind for
  your uncle."</p>

  <p>"What was in it?" he asked harshly.</p>

  <p>"Enough to hang you. I told him that if either Stephen or I were found,
  apparently killed by a wild animal, it would not be accident but murder."</p>

  <p>"He'll believe you." Richard laughed scornfully. "What a hope."</p>

  <p>"He must believe me. You've missed the important point. If I really met
  with an accident, I should not have left a note. No one can foretell an
  accident. It is something that happens by chance."</p>

  <p>In the silence that followed she heard the howling of the wolves but it
  affected her no more than the barking of a house-dog. She had the sense of
  facing a human wolf, ready to spring at her throat if self-interest decreed
  her death.</p>

  <p>"Where did you leave this note?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Where you will never find it," she replied.</p>

  <p>"You fool. If I cannot find it, no one else can."</p>

  <p>"I've arranged for that. It will be found only if I do not come back."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;assuming you come back&mdash;when my uncle reads it, he'll
  throw you out of Ganges as a poison-tongue lunatic."</p>

  <p>"He won't read it unless I am dead. If you don't want to be hanged, you
  will see that it does not get into his hands. Of course, I shall destroy it
  directly I get back to the house. It is not meant as a charge against
  you&mdash;only as a safety-measure."</p>

  <p>Then followed another pause when she looked fearfully around
  her&mdash;noting the tangle of stars seen through the branches of a cedar.
  She told herself that, if she survived, she would always remember how the
  glittering points seemed to flicker and dip in the dark spaces between the
  boughs, as though they were reflected in a pool which was stirred by the
  wind. Then Richard spoke again.</p>

  <p>"How do I know you are not lying?"</p>

  <p>"There's only one way to find out."</p>

  <p>"Tell me where you've hidden the note."</p>

  <p>"If I do, what's to stop you from killing me and then destroying it?"</p>

  <p>Although she was used to the profanity of navvies and had learned some of
  their words, Ann was chilled by the malignity of his curse.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, swiftly gaining control over his tongue, "you
  win."</p>

  <h3>VII.</h3>

  <p class="first">As Ann followed him back to the house she felt almost sick
  with suspense, fearing her note had been discovered prematurely. She had
  noticed that the men of the party who were credited with infallible masculine
  instinct, had not accepted her socially. In spite of his kindness, Sir
  Benjamin seemed vaguely uneasy about the attractive stranger who had crashed
  his hospitality, for he stressed his unconventionality. The professor plainly
  regarded her as attractive forbidden fruit, while&mdash;most significant of
  all&mdash;Sir Oswald had avoided her persistently.</p>

  <p>Directly they reached the back door, she broke away from Richard and
  rushed across the hall. She could hear his footsteps behind her on the stairs
  as she tore into the first bedroom off the gallery. He entered in time to see
  her snatch Lady Peacock's fur coat from the bed and pick up a folded paper
  which had been lying underneath it. She thrust it down the neck of her
  high-neck jumper and then faced him defiantly.</p>

  <p>"If you touch me I'll scream the place down."</p>

  <p>He glowered like a wild beast which had sprung at its prey&mdash;only to
  find a sheet of plate-glass between them.</p>

  <p>"Bedroom drama never appealed to me," he sneered. "But I am disappointed
  in your secret hiding-place. I expected something subtle."</p>

  <p>"It's subtle because it is simple," explained Ann. "Every one uses the
  cloakroom. But I knew Lady Peacock had left her coat up here and that it
  wouldn't be touched until she was going home."</p>

  <p>Her triumph was restrained by the hatred in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I've no more time to waste on you or your precious Stephen," he said.
  "You can get married for all I care...But I shall use the power of my wealth
  to break him. He'll never keep a job. I'll wait until you have children, so
  that you can starve in the gutter, '<i>en famille</i>.'"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-10"
     id="ch-10"></a>X. &mdash; ONE CAME BACK</h2>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">ANN tried to laugh but her defiance died under Richard's
  baleful glare. She felt the superstitious dread of a native whose sinews were
  withered by a hypothetical spell. At that moment there seemed to be neither
  hope nor future for herself and Stephen and she told herself that it would be
  better for him if they never met again. Although the pressure on her brain
  relaxed slightly after Richard sloped from the room, her heart was still so
  heavy that she went down the passage to the tower mechanically and with no
  expectation of seeing Stephen.</p>

  <p>It was almost a relief to find the room unoccupied; but even as she walked
  down the central staircase, the old disappointment returned. As her common
  sense revived she began to laugh at the melodrama of the threat.</p>

  <p>"Before he can even try to begin to ruin Stephen he has to come into his
  money," she reasoned. "Sir Benjamin is tough and may live for ever. His old
  uncle was rising a hundred and he might be living still if he hadn't been put
  in Victoria's nursing-home...But that might be one of Richard's lies. I
  mustn't believe it without proof."</p>

  <p>When she reached the cloakroom and saw her reflection in the mirror she
  was glad that she had met no one on her way.</p>

  <p>"I look just like James," she thought. "Poor old James. What a shocking
  mess he was."</p>

  <p>Fortunately she had means of repair&mdash;hot water, soap and
  clothes-brushes. The light shone down on the primrose tiles and chromium
  fittings and her spirits began to rise. It gave her pleasure to wash the
  grime from the golden-tan of her skin and to comb out the tangles of her
  hair. After she had pressed it into a finger-wave, she tried to mend her torn
  suit. There were needles and cottons in a box in a drawer but she dared not
  stay too long away from the drawing-room. When she had cobbled up a torn
  sleeve, she decided to leave the ladder in her stocking, since such an
  accident in the course of an evening ranked with "an act of God."</p>

  <p>Feeling conspicuous and self-conscious she entered the drawing-room, but
  only two persons appeared to notice her. Isabella stared at
  her&mdash;suspicion in the wild magnificence of her eyes&mdash;while the
  professor came to meet her. His smile was ironic as he asked her a
  question.</p>

  <p>"Did you enjoy your stroll with Richard?"</p>

  <p>"I was glad to get some fresh air," she replied. "And now I'd like to
  rest. I'm not used to your black-out."</p>

  <p>Although she walked away from him towards an isolated seat, he picked up a
  frail gilt chair and followed her.</p>

  <p>"When I saw you go out with Richard," he said, "I was naturally surprised.
  You must have either a very confiding nature or a short memory...Any more
  exciting adventures&mdash;or broken bridges?"</p>

  <p>"No," snapped Ann, glaring at the professor as he touched her sleeve.</p>

  <p>"You've torn your coat," he said.</p>

  <p>"And there's a button loose. <i>And</i> there's a run in my stocking.
  Don't miss anything."</p>

  <p>"Certainly the total is impressive. What have you two been doing?"</p>

  <p>"Dancing in a fairy ring. You may believe that."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I can. From your appearance, you might have been
  'straight down the crooked lane and all round the square."</p>

  <p>"You've guessed it. Actually I've been looking for a man who isn't
  there."</p>

  <p>The professor bowed in the stately manner decreed by a double-chin.</p>

  <p>"My Lady of Mystery," he murmured, "don't carry it too far. We are only
  simple people here."</p>

  <p>"Then you should recognise the truth. It's this. I've begun
  something&mdash;and I mean to <i>finish</i> it."</p>

  <p>Again the professor bent his head in homage before he rose from the
  protesting chair and strolled over to the card-table. His wife greeted him by
  making the Victory sign.</p>

  <p>"My luck is turning," she said. "I shall do the Victory Roll going
  home."</p>

  <p>"Too bad," remarked Victoria. "I cannot give you your revenge. I must have
  a professional talk with Sir Benjamin's nephew."</p>

  <p>As she listened, Kitty seemed actually to swell with indignation&mdash;an
  allusion created by her flooding colour and stiffened muscles.</p>

  <p>"You can't do it," she protested in a choked voice. "It's against the
  ethics of card-playing. They're built up on a code of honour. The most
  unscrupulous swindler will redeem his IOU." She added, as though to clinch
  her argument, "It's not done."</p>

  <p>"All the same, it's going to be done," said Victoria. "I make my own
  traditions. I can't stay up too late as I have to start early to-morrow. A
  major operation counts more with me than helping you to balance your domestic
  budget. I'm sure your husband will agree."</p>

  <p>The professor had no option but to incline his head, although he too was
  shocked by Victoria's violation of fair play.</p>

  <p>"I agree with you that a successful operation&mdash;even if you lose the
  patient&mdash;is of paramount importance," he said. "But I would like to
  submit that my wife is within her rights to claim a gambler's privilege.
  Can't we compromise? Is it absolutely necessary for you to consult with
  Richard?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. I have a point to clear and he is usually informative."</p>

  <p>"Then why not play on until he shows up. By the way, where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," cried Isabella, turning to Ann, "where is he? You were with him
  last."</p>

  <p>As they looked at her Ann felt that her torn coat was the target for all
  eyes. She told herself that she could not have felt guiltier if she had
  actually murdered Richard in self-defence.</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">"He left me when we got back to the house," she said,
  suppressing the episode of the bedroom.</p>

  <p>"I can tell you where he is," remarked Sir Benjamin, glancing at the
  clock. "He's making a final round of the Houses. He'll soon be back. You can
  play on till then, Dr. Pybus."</p>

  <p>Victoria plainly resented being forced and took her revenge by looking at
  her hands.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," she said. "I must go to the cloakroom."</p>

  <p>"Well, be quick," implored Kitty. "You're immaculate, so don't stop to
  make running-repairs."</p>

  <p>Ann watched Victoria walk out of the room at a slow and measured pace.
  There was something in her extreme hauteur which reminded the girl of an
  aristocrat going to the guillotine. The next second she remembered
  that&mdash;if her morbid suspicion was correct&mdash;Victoria was unconscious
  of doom.</p>

  <p>"Kitty's luck has turned," she thought. "Richard's luck may turn too. One
  of his shots in the dark may come off."</p>

  <p>She waited for a few minutes before she stole out of the room and crossed
  the hall to the cloakroom. As she opened the door softly, she realised that
  Victoria did not expect interruption, for there were no sounds of splashing
  or running water. Instead of washing, Victoria was examining a small object
  which she held under the light. When she heard Ann she hid it swiftly inside
  her bag before she spoke to the girl. Her eyes and lips remained
  expressionless but her voice betrayed cold anger.</p>

  <p>"Why do you follow me? Surely I have a right to personal privacy?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly Ann felt too battered by prejudice to try to justify her
  interference.</p>

  <p>"I only came to warn you," she said baldly.</p>

  <p>"Warn <i>me</i>? What do you mean? Are you daring to threaten me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be silly. I only want to put you on your guard."</p>

  <p>"Very kind. And who am I to guard against?"</p>

  <p>"Richard."</p>

  <p>As Ann turned towards the door Victoria shouted a command.</p>

  <p>"Come back. Has Richard been talking to you about me? Did he tell you
  anything about my affairs?"</p>

  <p>"I'm answering no questions," replied Ann.</p>

  <p>She almost ran back to the drawing-room where Kitty was quivering with
  impatience.</p>

  <p>"What's the sporting doctor doing to waste time?" she asked. "Is she
  taking a shower? Tell her we can always change to strip-poker."</p>

  <p>"She won't be long," promised Ann.</p>

  <p>A little later Victoria strolled back and seated herself at the card-table
  without any apology for holding up the game. Her break seemed to have
  ruptured her luck, for she lost oftener than she won; but as Ann watched the
  fall of the cards, she decided that the doctor had lost the power to
  concentrate.</p>

  <p>"I've got her guessing," she thought triumphantly.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she started at the sound of the front-door bell.</p>

  <p>"Shall I see who it is?" she asked, her thoughts flying to Stephen.</p>

  <p>"Thank you&mdash;no," replied Sir Benjamin. "Richard will do that. You are
  my guest."</p>

  <p>As no footsteps were heard in the hall he began to maltreat the corners of
  his cards.</p>

  <p>"Why doesn't the boy go?" he muttered. "He should be back by now. He knows
  the maids are all in bed. It might be Hogarth."</p>

  <p>"No, it's John." Isabella's voice was triumphant. "He has come for me. He
  knows I loathe driving in the black-out. My eyes are too big and somehow they
  seem to swallow the light....knew he'd come. I've been calling to him,
  calling, calling. Wherever he is and whatever he is doing, he always hears
  me."</p>

  <p>"Might be awkward at times," remarked Kitty.</p>

  <p>Ann missed the comedy as Isabella veiled her gleam of conquest with the
  sweep of her long lashes. She looked mysterious and withdrawn&mdash;an
  enchantress with power to draw the souls of men. It pained Ann to remember
  poor John&mdash;with unwashed blood-streaked face&mdash;rushing from the
  house in hope of future salvation.</p>

  <p>"I must let him in," said Isabella. "He will expect to see <i>me</i>
  waiting for him at the door."</p>

  <p>As the bell rang again Ann forestalled Isabella by a swift
  counter-move.</p>

  <p>"Don't stop the game," she cried, running from the room.</p>

  <p>On her way across the hall she felt keen disappointment at John's lapse
  into slavery. She told herself that he was past help and stinging words of
  reproach were on her lips as she opened the door. They dried up at the sight
  of the man who was waiting outside.</p>

  <p>He was pale, shortish and stout&mdash;considering his comparative
  youth&mdash;while he wore thick glasses and carried an immaculately-rolled
  umbrella. She noticed that he was unusually well-dressed and presented a
  professional appearance.</p>

  <p>"<i>James</i>," she cried. "Am I glad to see you? Come in."</p>

  <p>James followed her into the hall where he stood blinking at the
  lights.</p>

  <p>"Quite a palatial interior," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"They are very palatial people," said Ann. "And so are you. You look
  terribly smart and prosperous."</p>

  <p>"I hope to blot out your last impression of me," explained James, beaming
  with modest pride. "I was never so ashamed in my life when I got home and saw
  my reflection in the glass."</p>

  <p>As they smiled at one another, James was gratified by her welcome and Ann
  felt the assurance of solid backing. With James's weight behind her, she was
  protected from danger, while she knew that his respectability would appeal to
  Sir Benjamin and his guests. He was not only an umbrella&mdash;he was also
  social whitewash.</p>

  <p>"You'll never know what it means to me to have you here," she told
  him.</p>

  <p>"Good." He beamed again. "I was afraid you might think I was intruding.
  But I felt anxious about your safety. While I was in my bath my brain
  cleared, and I grew convinced that there was malice behind my unpleasant
  experience. The chemist I went to suspected some drug."</p>

  <p>As Ann said nothing he stared at her with the concentration of short
  sight.</p>

  <p>"You look different," he said. "You're paler and you've torn your
  suit...Ann, have you too had some unpleasant accident?"</p>

  <p>Instantly she realised the need for caution. She remembered that
  opposition used to act as a magnet to James&mdash;drawing him on to
  attack&mdash;and that it was impossible to deflect him from his purpose if he
  was convinced that action was necessary.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly," she said. "One or two odd things happened but they could be
  explained away. All the same, once I'm out of this house I never want to
  enter it again."</p>

  <p>"Excellent. We'll start at once. But before we go, you must introduce me
  to Sir Benjamin so that I can explain the situation to him. I wish to proceed
  in the proper way. Otherwise, this might appear an abduction...Will you
  kindly get your hat and coat as quickly as possible?"</p>

  <p>"But, James," protested Ann, "you've forgotten the reunion. It's over at
  twelve. I must stay to the end."</p>

  <p>"Out of the question," said James. "I'm pressed for time and I cannot
  waste an unnecessary minute."</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">His pompous voice was his shield against embarrassment. As a
  matter of fact, his prosperous appearance was misleading, for in spite of his
  industry his means were moderate. Consequently his expenditure was on terms
  of dangerous equality with his income, instead of the prudent lag,
  recommended by Dickens.</p>

  <p>At the present time, he was not sure that he had enough ready money to pay
  for the taxi which was waiting for him outside the main-entrance gates of the
  Zoo. As he had been doubtful of picking up a cab at the tube terminus, he was
  forced to hire one at a large station further down the line, while it was
  necessary to promise the driver the return fare in order to engage him.</p>

  <p>He stiffened in self-protection as Ann placed her hand on his arm.
  "Angel-lamb," she said. "Please stay."</p>

  <p>"Impossible," he told her. "You must come back with me, Ann. You've hinted
  that you're uneasy about the state of affairs here. Of course, I can't insist
  on your return but for your own sake I beg it."</p>

  <p>"But I can't leave yet. I want to meet Stephen."</p>

  <p>Ann was too overwrought to realise the tactlessness of her admission until
  James gave a mirthless laugh.</p>

  <p>"I'm concerned with your safety," he said, "but I cannot undertake to help
  you in your love affairs. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>"Hush,"</i> whispered Ann.</p>

  <p>As she realised that the drawing-room door was opening she grew conscious
  of a new danger. The reliable and conscientious James&mdash;by virtue of his
  qualities&mdash;might prove a dangerous obstacle to her reunion with Stephen.
  She knew that every male on the premises would welcome her removal in his
  safe company. It was a novel situation to her, since she had been used to
  masculine homage, owing to woman famine in the camps.</p>

  <p>She felt the regret of rejecting his protection when she appealed to him
  in an urgent whisper.</p>

  <p>"If you won't stay, please go at once. I don't want Sir Benjamin to think
  I'm entertaining a strange man."</p>

  <p>Unfortunately she used the wrong argument, for James coloured with
  indignation.</p>

  <p>"That would be a reflection on both of us," he said. "I will make a point
  of explaining my presence to him."</p>

  <p>"<i>No</i>. You must go at once."</p>

  <p>Ann's intervention came too late for, as she tried to drag James towards
  the front door, Sir Oswald strolled out of the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Are you Sir Benjamin Watson?" asked James, advancing to meet him.</p>

  <p>"No, that's a guest," said Ann, tugging at his sleeve. "Come, James."</p>

  <p>To her dismay James refused to be side-tracked.</p>

  <p>"Apparently I must introduce myself," he said. "Professor Short. I wish to
  apologise to Sir Benjamin for this intrusion. I am an old friend of Miss
  Sherborne's and as she is unused to the black-out I called for her, in order
  to see her safely back to her hotel. I have a taxi waiting in the road."</p>

  <p>His solid appearance and pedantic voice appealed to Sir Oswald. He was
  afraid that he might be called on to escort Ann to the tube terminus and he
  disliked the idea of being saddled with the responsibility of any one so
  attractive and mobile. Moreover, he had noticed the damage to Ann's suit
  and&mdash;as a man of the world&mdash;he had summed it up as the result of a
  romp with Richard. The idea was repugnant, since he liked the ladies whose
  protection he safeguarded to be worthy of the tested purity of the
  ingredients he used in the manufacture of his toilet preparations.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell Sir Benjamin you are here," he said heartily.</p>

  <p>Before he could reach the drawing-room, Sir Benjamin&mdash;attracted by
  the sound of voices&mdash;came into the hall.</p>

  <p>"Does any one want to see me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said James. "I do. Please introduce me, Ann."</p>

  <p>When James had repeated the explanation of his visit, Sir Benjamin beamed
  with approval.</p>

  <p>"Very thoughtful of you," he said. "I'll get my nephew to go with you to
  the main gates. The path winds and a stranger might find it tricky. Peacock,
  give the professor a drink in the library while Miss Sherborne is putting on
  her things."</p>

  <p>Ann felt the pull of three strong wills dragging at her like the suction
  of a rip-tide as Sir Benjamin gripped her arm and marched with her to the
  cloakroom. As she shut the door she heard the sound of his voice calling to
  his nephew. Then she looked around her with no hope of finding a way of
  escape, in the absence of windows or a second exit. She only knew that if she
  were escorted from Ganges in James's guardianship, she would never be
  permitted to enter its gates again. The process was inexorable&mdash;final
  and formal as expulsion from college.</p>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">"I must hide," she reasoned. "If James is in a hurry, he
  won't stop for them to find me. But I can't stay here. They'll send Lady
  Peacock or Mrs. Blake to dig me out."</p>

  <p>From the muted sound of Sir Benjamin's shouts, she concluded that he was
  walking down the passage towards the Tropical House, Sir Oswald and James
  were presumably in the library, whose open door commanded a view of both the
  dining-room and the staircase. Only two doors were out of their range of
  vision&mdash;those of the cloakroom and kitchen.</p>

  <p>Her only chance was to try her luck in the kitchen. She remembered that
  the housemaid had mentioned a back staircase by which Stephen had reached the
  turret. Although the tower-room would be a trap, she could go down the spiral
  stair to the dark lobby which had an outlet to the courtyard. There was an
  alternative choice&mdash;the back way out which led to the kitchen
  garden.</p>

  <p>Straining her ears, she slipped out of the cloakroom and crept towards the
  kitchen. She could hear voices from the drawing-room and the library, as well
  as the faint rumble of Sir Benjamin's thunder. The air seemed full of sound
  and she prayed she was unseen by any invisible witness when she closed the
  kitchen door behind her.</p>

  <p>The big room seemed darker and to have lost its comfort now that the glow
  from the range had died down. She noticed that the leopard cub was still in
  its basket&mdash;a bowl of milk beside it&mdash;and she felt grateful that it
  was not a puppy, endowed with the watch-dog instinct and eager to try out its
  voice. Stealing through a second kitchen&mdash;equipped with a gas-stove and
  Frigidaire&mdash;she hurried through the scullery to the back door.</p>

  <p>To her dismay it was not only securely fastened but the key was removed
  from the lock. As she stood staring at it, she remembered vaguely that
  Richard had stopped to unlock it before they went out into the grounds. It
  was evident that he was taking no chance of a maid slipping out to meet a
  sweetheart. The precaution seemed absurd and extreme until she connected it
  with the leopard cub. Undoubtedly it was valuable and Richard had to guard
  against its being stolen during the night.</p>

  <p>It was futile to wait there longer, so she began to look for the back
  stairs. She felt too harried and confused to make a systematic search
  and&mdash;in her impatience&mdash;she often opened a door twice, only to
  reveal coals or mops. At last, around a bend of a short crooked passage which
  she had mistaken for a dead-end, she stumbled on a flight of wooden steps
  covered with narrow linoleum.</p>

  <p>She began to mount them cautiously until she reached the fifth tread, when
  she stiffened and stopped to listen...Someone was coming down the stairs
  towards her...He was much higher up the flight, but she recognised a very
  slight drag in the footsteps which was characteristic of Richard.</p>

  <p>At first she stood as though petrified while her brain began to spin like
  a record, reeling off the odds against escape. If she went on climbing, she
  was bound to meet him, unless a miracle happened and he branched off into the
  main staircase. It was futile to hide in a closet, because a search would be
  made of the domestic offices, in an attempt to solve the mystery of her
  "Mistletoe-Bough" disappearance. Flight too seemed hopeless; Richard was
  coming down the back stairs and his uncle might enter the kitchen at any
  moment, when she would be caught between them.</p>

  <p>"I know now what they mean by a pincers-movement," she thought bitterly as
  she caught a new sound from the hall&mdash;a knocking upon wood.</p>

  <p>"Miss Sherborne," shouted Sir Benjamin. "Are you ready? Professor Short
  wants to start at once."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps she's not there," suggested James after a pause. "It's strange
  she does not answer."</p>

  <p>"She may be unwell," said Sir Oswald. "I'll fetch my wife."</p>

  <p>The hunt was out and Ann rushed back to the kitchen in a vain hope of
  finding a refuge. As she looked around her she noticed the kitchen-maid's
  white overall hanging from a peg. It was the work of a few seconds to slip it
  on and to tuck her mane of hair inside the neck. She was just in time to flop
  down on her knees beside the cub's basket before Sir Benjamin and Richard
  entered the kitchen simultaneously from different ends.</p>

  <p>"Were you calling me, sir?" asked Richard with insolent servility.</p>

  <p>"Yes," grunted Sir Benjamin. "Where the devil have you been? I want you to
  accompany Miss Sherborne and a friend of hers to the main gates. The chap is
  in a hurry&mdash;and now I've found you, I can't find her."</p>

  <p>"A chap?" asked Richard sharply.</p>

  <p>"A professor of sorts." Reminded of his existence, Sir Benjamin raised his
  voice. "Sorry, Professor, she doesn't seem to be here. I'll get my nephew to
  see if she's hiding anywhere for a lark."</p>

  <p>"It's a game that would appeal to her sense of humour," grinned Richard.
  "I'll take over, sir. If she's anywhere at the back, you may trust me to
  flush her."</p>

  <p>Ann listened in an agony of suspense lest notice should be taken of her.
  She was afraid that the cub might be awakened by the noise and she knew that
  a whimper from it would attract Sir Benjamin to its basket. As it began to
  stir restlessly, she tried to soothe it back to sleep. Fortunately it
  approved her touch, for, after a wriggle, it curled up in its former
  position. She realised, however, that Sir Benjamin was likely to assure
  himself of its well-being and her heart beat with sickening irregularity
  until Richard returned from his search.</p>

  <p>"Nowhere there," he announced. "Rebecca, has a young lady come through the
  kitchen?"</p>

  <p>At first Ann did not grasp the fact that he was speaking to her, and when
  she did so she could not pluck up her courage to reply.</p>

  <p>"Speak up and stop making noises like a goldfish," said Richard
  roughly.</p>

  <p>"<i>Richard</i>." Sir Benjamin spoke sternly. "I will tolerate rudeness to
  no one in my house." His own voice softened as he tried to encourage the back
  of a white overall which was all he could see of Ann. "Don't be afraid,
  Rebecca. Have you seen the young lady anywhere?"</p>

  <p>Ann realised that she had been saved from giving herself away by her
  attack of nerves. Otherwise she would have replied briskly and politely, in
  the manner of a well-trained maid&mdash;instead of reproducing the
  tongue-tied uncouthness of Rebecca. Grateful for the darkness of the recess,
  she shook her head vigorously.</p>

  <p>"No," she muttered.</p>

  <p>The footsteps of a new arrival saved her from further inquisition.</p>

  <p>"Forgive my following you, sir," said James. "I've come to say I cannot
  wait any longer. Please express my regret to Miss Sherborne and explain I
  have an urgent engagement."</p>

  <p>"At this time of night?" remarked Richard. "Lucky dog."</p>

  <p>"<i>Richard</i>." For the second time Sir Benjamin reproved his nephew.
  "This is Professor Short."</p>

  <p>"'James' to me," corrected Richard. "He's an old Borstal pal. How are you,
  James? You look a prosperous bloke. Have you given up your round of
  refuse-bins?"</p>

  <p>"Quite fit, thanks," was the frigid reply. "Good-night."</p>

  <p>"Wait. My uncle has ordered me to come to the gates with you."</p>

  <p>"No, thanks. I shall require no further help from <i>you</i>." James
  turned to Sir Benjamin when his cold voice melted. "Thank you for your
  hospitality. I have not tasted such excellent whisky for years. Good-night,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"I'll see you down the steps," said Sir Benjamin hospitably.</p>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">Ann strained her ears, waiting for her opportunity to
  escape. After Richard had followed his uncle to the hall, she could make a
  second attempt to reach the tower-room by the back stairs. She heard the slam
  of the front door and then located the directions of the distinctive
  footsteps&mdash;Sir Benjamin's back to the drawing-room and Richard's down
  the passage leading to the Tropical House.</p>

  <p>She gave the cub a final pat and was about to rise when it clawed her
  sleeve to show her that it was awake. Staring at her with burning golden
  eyes, it climbed out of its basket and began to knead her overall with its
  claws.</p>

  <p>"Cut it," she implored it. "I can't play with you now, buddy. Night life
  is definitely out. Back you go."</p>

  <p>The cub allowed her to make it comfortable in its basket, but when she
  turned to go it jumped out and began to follow her. After the performance had
  been repeated several times she grew desperate. Her sense of responsibility
  was too strong for her to leave it alone, lest it should leap on the hot
  stove or injure itself in some other way.</p>

  <p>"Darn the lot of them," she thought angrily. "An infant like this
  shouldn't be left."</p>

  <p>She was too engrossed chasing the cub to realise that her complaint was
  receiving prompt attention. This time she did not hear the sound of bedroom
  slippers as a girl entered the kitchen. Her short dark hair was rough and she
  wore a grey woollen dressing-gown.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Ann she started and clapped her hands over her mouth to
  suppress a scream before indignation drove her to the attack.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mine</i>," she said, pointing to Ann's overall with an accusing
  finger.</p>

  <p>"Rebecca," gasped Ann. "What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"I've come to fetch Gloria. She always sleeps with me. She thinks I'm her
  mother."</p>

  <p>As she remembered the cub's relationship to the beautiful
  leopardess&mdash;Delia&mdash;Ann considered that its intelligence had been
  slandered.</p>

  <p>"Over to you," she said, thrusting it into the girl's arms. "Actually,
  she's rather too matey."</p>

  <p>"She smells me," said Rebecca, pointing to the overall. "That is
  <i>mine</i>. She thinks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ann was standing with her back to the door, but its opening creak,
  together with the alarm on Rebecca's face, made her leap to the shadow of the
  recess. Then she saw Sir Benjamin stare in astonishment at the little
  kitchen-maid's bare ankles.</p>

  <p>"That's a quick change," he said, pointing to the nightdress visible under
  her short dressing-gown. "Regular Protean act. What are you doing with
  Gloria?"</p>

  <p>He laughed when he heard the confused explanation.</p>

  <p>"So Cook doesn't know," he chuckled. "Good for you. Bless you, I've
  sneaked enough cats to bed with me in my time...Be off with you&mdash;the
  pair of you. Young hussies."</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands and laughed again as Rebecca scuffled from the
  kitchen&mdash;leaving a slipper behind her but clasping the cub in her arms.
  Then he turned to Ann and the smile left his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I would like an explanation of this." He touched the white overall.
  "Didn't you hear me calling you? I didn't do it merely to exercise my
  voice."</p>

  <p>"I know," faltered Ann. "It was terrible of me. But I didn't want to go
  with James and leave the party. You must understand that."</p>

  <p>"Why? I never went to parties. I was a circus kid," said Sir Benjamin
  pathetically, apparently forgetting his pre-Eton childhood. He added briskly,
  "The party will soon break up. For the sake of a few extra minutes you've
  lost the chance of a personal escort back to your hotel."</p>

  <p>"I'll be all right," Ann assured him. "I've only got to catch a bus...But
  you don't know what this evening means to me. I've not been in a civilised
  house for years. And I shall never be here again."</p>

  <p>"What makes you say that?" he asked reproachfully, although his face
  brightened.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to join the army and I shall try to get drafted abroad. I may
  want to&mdash;to forget."</p>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">Sir Benjamin smiled at her as he offered her his arm.</p>

  <p>"I'm honoured," he said. "Please stay."</p>

  <p>In spite of his invitation, Ann felt that she had been taken into custody
  when he marched her into the drawing-room. Too many accidents had happened
  recently for him to take more chances on an attractive stranger. He pushed
  her into a chair at the table and sat beside her.</p>

  <p>"Ever played poker?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied. "But I haven't a chip."</p>

  <p>"I'll stake you. I'm used to staking pretty ladies&mdash;all of them
  felines."</p>

  <p>Ann felt a flare of rebellion before she yielded to superior pressure. The
  inner voice which she called "Mark" was silent and no prescience told her of
  her good fortune. She did not know that&mdash;whatever the fluctuations of
  the game and whether she won or lost, it was to her personal advantage to
  remain in the drawing-room with the other guests.</p>

  <p>She soon became aware that she was not the only uneasy player. Isabella
  made no pretence of an intelligent interest in her cards. A dummy wound up to
  perform certain movements would have put over a better show. Victoria
  appeared to be annoyed by her losses. Her luck seemed to be completely out
  and presently she rose from the table.</p>

  <p>"Where's Richard?" she asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Here," said a harsh voice from the doorway. "At your service, Madam."</p>

  <p>Directly she glanced at him Ann was chilled by his quivering
  lips&mdash;his glistening skin and gleaming eyes. She clenched her hands to
  subdue her nerves as Victoria asked him a question.</p>

  <p>"Have you found those slides I want to see?"</p>

  <p>"I have," replied Richard. "All is ready for the inspection of the famous
  doctor."</p>

  <p>"Good. I'll come now."</p>

  <p>"But you haven't given me my revenge," protested Kitty.</p>

  <p>Victoria glanced at her watch as though she considered it the only
  reliable timepiece.</p>

  <p>"When I come back I'll play for another ten minutes," she said. "You could
  win a fortune&mdash;or lose one&mdash;in that time."</p>

  <p>Ann watched Victoria and Richard go from the room with a baffled sense of
  helplessness. She wanted to shout a warning to Victoria&mdash;but she did not
  know what she feared...</p>

  <p>She only knew that two had gone out of the room&mdash;and only one would
  return...</p>

  <p>Although the game went on the life had died out of it. Even Kitty seemed
  to have lost interest in her winnings.</p>

  <p>"I don't want anybody's money here," she confessed. "I'm only playing to
  keep my luck warm. When the doctor comes back I'm going to raise her to the
  ceiling. And when I say 'ceiling,' I mean the R.A.F. one."</p>

  <p>Presently Isabella pushed her hands distractedly through the waves of her
  blonde hair.</p>

  <p>"Big Ben," she asked, "do you mind if I ring up my John? He's not
  come&mdash;and I'm worried about him. He may be suffering from the results of
  his fall. Concussion&mdash;or anything."</p>

  <p>As she hurried from the room, she presented a picturesque type of anxious
  wife which deceived nobody who knew her. Then the game limped on again, while
  Kitty grew still more impatient.</p>

  <p>"What ages she is," she groaned, looking at the clock. "We'll be terribly
  late getting home, but I'm set on having my revenge." She broke off to
  exclaim at Ann's tense face. "How spooky you look. What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Can you hear anything?" asked Ann.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"I can. It sounds like dull footsteps a long way off. Someone's running
  down the passage from the Tropical House."</p>

  <p>"Imagination," said Sir Benjamin.</p>

  <p>"No." Lady Peacock spoke with authority. "I heard the slam of a door.
  Someone's in a hurry. I hope nothing's wrong."</p>

  <p>All eyes were fixed upon the door as the card-players sat motionless at
  the table&mdash;listening...</p>

  <p>Listening.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-11"
     id="ch-11"></a>XI. &mdash; TWELVE GOOD MEN AND TRUE</h2>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">THEY heard footsteps crossing the hall&mdash;pelting down
  over the marble flags as though someone were in desperate haste. The door was
  pushed open and Victoria stood on the threshold. She waited there for a few
  seconds to regain her calm, before she crossed to Sir Benjamin and spoke to
  him in the quiet professional voice of a doctor announcing a death.</p>

  <p>"You must be brave. I've bad news for you."</p>

  <p>Ann saw the panic leap into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"What?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"It's Richard. There's been an accident." Victoria paused before she
  added, "A fatal accident."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"The Snake House."</p>

  <p>Sir Benjamin's face looked the colour of a black plum from a sudden rush
  of blood.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible," he said. "He couldn't get in. I keep the keys."</p>

  <p>"He told me he had a duplicate," quavered Ann, fearing to hold back any
  evidence.</p>

  <p>Sir Benjamin still stared at Victoria with dazed and incredulous eyes.</p>

  <p>"But I warned him off them," he said. "I forbade him to touch them. Are
  you sure he is&mdash;dead?"</p>

  <p>"There's no doubt about that," said Victoria. "The rawest medical student
  would know that life is extinct. But if you would like a second opinion, may
  I ring up your own doctor?"</p>

  <p>"No, no. You know your job."</p>

  <p>Once again Ann watched the backwash of blood in a ghastly ebb which left
  his face ashen and streaked with minute purple veins. His lips quivered and
  his eyes looked blurred as he put out his hand, groping as though he were
  blind. Instantly Kitty took it and began to chafe his fingers gently, before
  she put her arm around him and soothed him as though he were one of her
  children.</p>

  <p>"There, there," she murmured. "It will all come right."</p>

  <p>At that moment Ann saw her stripped of her meretricious and grasping
  qualities&mdash;a compassionate woman and a loyal friend.</p>

  <p>"Kitty," whispered Sir Benjamin. "You know what this means. It's the end
  of everything. I've lost it. I've lost my Zoo...How shall I tell my
  friends?"</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry about them," said Sir Oswald. "I will see that a
  discreet version of the accident is circulated. I am sure you will meet with
  universal sympathy and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Oswald," interrupted his wife. "Sir Benjamin is talking
  about his poor animals."</p>

  <p>At that moment Ann felt that Sir Benjamin's tragedy eclipsed her own
  menaced hopes. She was playing for a high stake&mdash;her future
  happiness&mdash;but he was seeing the end of the game....boy in a
  circus&mdash;loving wild animals with passion&mdash;had dreamed a dream which
  came true; and now he was waking up to the misery of a grey rain-spattered
  day...</p>

  <p>"Kitty," he said, "I have to make a bitter decision. I have to ask myself
  whether it is kinder to destroy or sell. And you know the answer."</p>

  <p>"Yes." Her voice was choked. "The other way would be too cruel after all
  they've had. But you must shoot them yourself. Romulus and Remus&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As Kitty broke down her husband spoke for the first time.</p>

  <p>"It may not come to that. We'll all rally round and make a hell of a fight
  for it."</p>

  <p>"Thanks." Sir Benjamin brightened up like a child who has been promised a
  treat. "Peacock," he said abruptly, "you want that new land for a factory. If
  the Zoo is saved, I'll make a present of it to the nation. I'll only keep a
  belt of rough between it and the Zoo."</p>

  <p>Ann recognised that he was offering the ancient sacrifice in propitiation
  to the Fates, even while Sir Oswald registered a business bargain.</p>

  <p>"Very generous of you, Watson," he said. "As things are, it looks as if
  the land would be useless to you, so you'll be forced to throw it on the
  market. Frankly, your offer is another Spitfire bribe; but as I'm among
  friends, I'll admit I am open to corruption."</p>

  <p>Then his smile faded and he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The snag is," he said, "I'm doubtful now of being able to swing it after
  such a specially nasty accident. Snakes are definitely
  unpleasant&mdash;whether you're drunk or sober. All I can promise is to do my
  best for you at the meeting."</p>

  <p>"It's no good, Peacock. You're right. I knew it all along. My Zoo is
  doomed."</p>

  <p>Sir Benjamin covered his eyes with his hand, but after a few moments
  regained mastery over his emotions.</p>

  <p>"I must see Richard," he said to Victoria. "Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"I left him there in the Snake House," she told him. "I shut the door for
  safety."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Quite right. I'll go to him. But first, I must ask you all to leave
  at once."</p>

  <p>There was a general movement as the guests rose from their
  seats&mdash;each conveying the impression of relief at the end of a harrowing
  scene. Only Ann stood as though her muscles were locked. Her face was pale
  and her eyes were dark with despair as she gazed at the clock. The last
  half-hour had been broken and only a margin of minutes now divided her from
  midnight.</p>

  <p>She was beaten by the time-factor. In the new and tragic circumstances,
  she could not plot to hide or ask for permission to stay. Decency demanded
  her departure since Sir Benjamin had made it plain that he wanted to be alone
  with his tragedy.</p>

  <p>"Richard will see you to the gates," he said. "Oh...forgot....shall miss
  the boy. He had his faults but he knew his job."</p>

  <p>Even in her dark minute, Ann was struck by the redeeming phrase which
  covered up a cankered character&mdash;"He knew his job." Then she remembered
  that. Isabella too would be broken by Richard's death. It seemed a heavy
  moment of total loss. Sir Benjamin had lost his Zoo&mdash;Isabella had lost
  Richard&mdash;she had lost Stephen...As she lingered, Victoria&mdash;who had
  gone out of the room&mdash;returned holding a glass.</p>

  <p>"Drink this," she said to Sir Benjamin. "It will steady your nerves.
  Afterwards you can see your nephew. As I'm a doctor, would you like me to
  stay on?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he muttered, swallowing the draught mechanically. "But the others
  must go."</p>

  <p>"We're all going now," Kitty assured him. "I'll be over early
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>She kissed Sir Benjamin and the professor patted his shoulder, while the
  Peacocks murmured conventional expressions of condolence. Sir Benjamin
  appeared to be unconscious of them all as he stared into vacancy. Then Kitty
  gripped Ann's arm and drew her towards the door.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad that doctor thing is staying with him," she whispered. "He can't
  stand much more. I'm terribly anxious about him."</p>

  <p>As she spoke Sir Benjamin struggled to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I will see you to the gates as usual," he said. "I must be sure that the
  Zoo is safely shut up for the night. Get your coats and be quick."</p>

  <p>When they reached the hall Ann spoke to Lady Peacock.</p>

  <p>"I'll get your coat for you."</p>

  <p>She had never run faster as she dashed up the stairs and into the
  guest-room where she snatched up the fur coat from the bed. Throwing it over
  one shoulder, she sprinted down the connecting passage and burst into the
  tower-room. It was still empty and her smile was bitter as she gazed around
  her.</p>

  <p>"The end of seven years," she said.</p>

  <p>As she snapped off the light and plunged the place into darkness, her
  action seemed symbolic. Her sun had been swallowed by the Snake which is
  supposed to ring the Globe.</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">The Peacocks came to meet her in the hall and Lady Peacock
  received her coat with gracious thanks.</p>

  <p>"How thoughtful of you to get it and how quick you've been. Your legs are
  younger than mine. Are we all here? Yes, the Blakes are with Sir Benjamin.
  But where is Mrs. Cumberland?"</p>

  <p>"Isabella?" asked Sir Benjamin vaguely. "Isn't she here? I'll call
  her."</p>

  <p>He raised his voice in the familiar boom but Isabella did not appear. He
  shouted again, when in the following pause the passage-door which connected
  with the Tropical House was opened and she entered the hall. It was plain
  that she knew about the tragedy for Ann was shocked by the transformation in
  her appearance, caused by the violence of her grief. Her large eyes were
  reduced to slits by swollen lids and her face was puffed and wet with tears.
  When she spoke, however, her voice was controlled.</p>

  <p>"You," she said curtly to Victoria. "I've some questions to ask you. I
  have just seen Richard. I want to know exactly what happened."</p>

  <p>Victoria ignored her and spoke pointedly to Sir Benjamin.</p>

  <p>"I was going to give you the details in private," she said.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter now?" asked Sir Benjamin heavily. "He's dead. Let
  them hear what happened. In a few hours it will be everybody's secret."</p>

  <p>He staggered as he spoke and Isabella took his arm and led him back to the
  drawing-room, while the others followed them. She guided him to a chair and
  stood behind him; then&mdash;putting her arms around his neck&mdash;she
  pressed her fingers, over his lips. It was no longer the gesture of a siren,
  but a measure of precaution to prevent him from speaking.</p>

  <p>"You're a doctor, Victoria," she said. "Were you able to diagnose the
  cause of Richard's death?"</p>

  <p>"Of course." Victoria shrugged contemptuously. "Sir Benjamin will confirm
  it the moment he sees his nephew. Richard died from snake-venom."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;poison? Was he bitten by the snakes?"</p>

  <p>"Obviously."</p>

  <p>Ann was startled by the sudden light which flared up in Sir Benjamin's
  eyes. Isabella still pressed her fingers over his lips while she looked
  across at the Blakes. Although Kitty seemed puzzled, she plainly scented a
  development, for her face grew suddenly acute as she whispered to her
  husband. He responded by picking up a spare scoring-block which had been left
  behind them by the bridge players when they went to the library. Sitting
  behind Victoria, so that she could not see what he was doing, he drew from
  his pocket his cherished pencil, in readiness to take down her statement.</p>

  <p>As she watched the scene, Ann sensed a change in the atmosphere of the
  room. She had a curious feeling of the presence of an invisible audience. She
  fancied that a shadowy company of "twelve good men and true"&mdash;butcher,
  baker and candlestick-maker&mdash;were seated in a ring around Victoria,
  listening to her with impartial justice and waiting for her to make a fatal
  admission...Then Sir Benjamin removed Isabella's fingers from his lips and
  spoke in a steady voice.</p>

  <p>"It seems I've been mistaken. I was under the impression that my nephew
  had been interfering with the big snakes and that they had crushed him to
  death."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> never told you that," said Victoria suspiciously as though she
  scented a trap. "The others heard what I said. He's been poisoned."</p>

  <p>Suddenly a belated memory caused Kitty to gasp with excitement even while
  it seemed to Ann that the dim circle of twelve men had moved closer to
  Victoria.</p>

  <p>"I would like to hear exactly what happened," said Sir Benjamin. "I want
  my friends to hear it too. Leave out nothing. Don't spare my feelings."</p>

  <p>Victoria snapped her black eyes over her audience and became instantly at
  her ease. Accustomed to lecturing, she appreciated especially those classes
  where no member was in a position to challenge her statements or ask awkward
  questions.</p>

  <p>"Richard came with me to the Snake House at my request," she said. "I'm
  experimenting with the curative properties of venom, so naturally, I'm
  interested in the fountain-head&mdash;the snake itself. As we were going
  there, I was struck by his bad colour. As a matter of fact, I diagnosed heart
  trouble with liver complication. When we reached the Snake House, he told me
  to wait in the passage while he went on alone, to be sure that all the cages
  were securely closed. It seemed an unnecessary precaution but he was
  insistent that there must not be another accident for the sake of his
  uncle."</p>

  <p>The statement about Richard's anxiety rang false and the ring of shadowy
  jurymen tightened around Victoria.</p>

  <p>"I waited for some time," she went on, "and then I grew uneasy. I wondered
  whether he had fainted as the temperature was so high. So I went into the
  Snake House. Richard was stretched out on the floor and his body was
  contorted into an arched posture, while the door of the poison-snake cage was
  wide open. I stamped to frighten the creatures away and then made a hasty
  examination. There was not the least doubt that he had been bitten fatally.
  His face was cyanosed and he was rigid." She turned to Sir Benjamin and
  added, "He must have fainted before he was attacked, so he did not
  suffer."</p>

  <p>In the silence which followed, Ann was amazed by the change in Sir
  Benjamin. The unnatural pallor had left his face and his eyes were bright
  with interest. He nodded when Isabella whispered in his ear, and then he
  spoke in a strong vibrant voice.</p>

  <p>"I have only one more question. Did he linger or was he killed by a
  virulent poison?"</p>

  <p>"I have already told you that." Victoria's voice was impatient. "His death
  was probably a matter of seconds."</p>

  <p>Again Sir Benjamin's voice rang through the room.</p>

  <p>"No one is to leave the house. This is <i>not</i> an accident. It is
  murder."</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">"Not an accident," cried Kitty jubilantly. "Then Romulus and
  Remus are saved."</p>

  <p>Ann too felt a surge of joy at her eleventh-hour reprieve. There still
  seemed a chance for her to keep her appointment with Stephen. Then she
  noticed that the Peacocks were seriously disturbed by Sir Benjamin's words.
  Lady Peacock's face was flushed with indignation and she took her husband's
  arm as though for protection. He patted her hand to reassure her but his own
  colour was high as he challenged Sir Benjamin.</p>

  <p>"You must explain exactly what you mean, Watson. You cannot level a vague
  charge of murder and leave it there. As your guest, I speak for my
  fellow-guests. I demand to know if any one of us&mdash;or all of us&mdash;are
  suspected. And on what grounds?"</p>

  <p>"Pipe down, Peacock," said Sir Benjamin. "I'll make it clear and simple.
  Dr. Pybus has just told us that Richard was poisoned by venom which acted
  very swiftly. Now I say he was murdered. So the inference is that he was
  poisoned by the last person who was with him. Is that correct?"</p>

  <p>"Correct," said the professor while the Peacocks nodded agreement.</p>

  <p>"I protest," declared Victoria. "<i>I</i> was the last person to see him.
  The autopsy will confirm my diagnosis that he was poisoned by snake-venom. I
  have been sparing you, Sir Benjamin, but you force me to tell you something
  rather horrible. After I left the Snake House, I looked through the glass and
  saw that the snakes were crawling over your nephew."</p>

  <p>"I believe you," said Sir Benjamin. "You counted on the snakes covering-up
  for you. That was possible for when they're scared they get angry. Even one
  puncture could account for the presence of poison."</p>

  <p>It was evident that Victoria accepted his admission as weakness. Her eyes
  gleamed as she spoke in a threatening voice.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean by 'covering.' But I warn you that you have
  slandered me indirectly before witnesses. I could bring an action and claim
  heavy damages. It is fortunate for you that I value my professional
  reputation too highly to risk even the suspicion of smut which might stick if
  I took the matter into court."</p>

  <p>"The matter will come into court, whether you wish it or not," Sir
  Benjamin told her. "You know a lot&mdash;but not quite enough. You don't know
  that there is not a single poisonous snake left in my collection."</p>

  <p>As she listened, all the life went out of Victoria's face, so that Ann was
  reminded of a death-mask; only her eyes glittered with the fury of a trapped
  creature. Sir Benjamin pointed at her with a shaking finger as he pressed
  home his charge.</p>

  <p>"You killed my unfortunate nephew with a shot of virulent poison. You
  either induced him to swallow it by trickery or you jabbed him with a syringe
  when his attention was distracted. Then you opened the large poison-snake
  cage&mdash;but you were misled by the old label...On the outbreak of war, I
  was obliged to take the precaution of having every venomous snake destroyed
  in case of air raids."</p>

  <p>As though exhausted by his emotions, Sir Benjamin lay back in his chair
  and closed his eyes. It was Sir Oswald's chance to take command and clarify
  the points of the situation.</p>

  <p>"Medical evidence has been supplied by Dr. Pybus that the deceased has
  been poisoned. Since the snakes have been proved impotent, it follows that he
  was killed by human agency. I would like to point out that&mdash;with the
  exception of one person&mdash;we were all in the drawing-room, so our alibis
  are established. The exception is Dr. Pybus. In fairness to her, we would
  like to hear if she has anything to say."</p>

  <p>Victoria laughed contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"It's utterly fantastic," she said. "Even supposing I had opportunity,
  what motive could I have for killing a man I hardly know?"</p>

  <p>In the silence which followed, Ann again looked around her. She found it
  difficult to believe in the reality of the scene because it reminded her of a
  stage play which was ceasing to grip her interest. She had the familiar
  sensations of a playgoer, towards the end of the third act, when the outside
  world was beginning to distract her attention with the problems of weather
  and transport. Therefore she felt no thrill of excitement when Isabella made
  a dramatic charge.</p>

  <p>"You killed him, Victoria, because he was blackmailing you. You were doing
  too well out of your bargain and he wanted some of the loot. I don't want to
  damn his memory now he's dead&mdash;but he wouldn't be dead except for
  you&mdash;so you're going to take the rap...Listen&mdash;all of you."</p>

  <p>Isabella stood under a strong light which shone down on her shimmering
  gown but shaded her face&mdash;making it appear semi-invisible&mdash;so that
  she seemed less human than an accusing justice, speaking through the metallic
  lips of a silver image...Again Ann listened to the story of the sordid pact
  which she had heard first in the Tropical House. She noticed that Kitty
  occasionally whispered to the Peacocks, so she was not surprised when Sir
  Oswald asked a question.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Pybus," he asked mildly, "why should Richard tempt you to forestall
  Nature and murder so old a man as Sir Benjamin's uncle? Surely his death was
  only a matter of a short time?"</p>

  <p>Victoria acknowledged the elementary attempt to trap her with a scornful
  smile.</p>

  <p>"As this is the first time I've heard of it," she said, "you had better
  ask Isabella. It's her story."</p>

  <p>"Can't you work it out for yourself?" asked Isabella impatiently.
  "Actually the old uncle could go on existing for centuries while Big Ben
  could stop a bomb, or get measles, or anything. Big Ben was Great-Uncle's
  sole heir. The ancient relative was incapable of making a fresh will, if Big
  Ben pegged out first, so his wealth would be divided among a host of
  relatives. But Richard was also Big Ben's sole heir, so he would scoop in the
  lot if the ancestor died first."</p>

  <p>"If he was waiting for dead men's shoes, the chances were he would wait
  the dickens of a time for mine," snapped Sir Benjamin. "I am not an old
  man."</p>

  <p>Isabella hesitated before she spoke.</p>

  <p>"I'm terribly sorry, Big Ben, but you've got it coming to you. Richard
  reckoned you'd break up if you lost your Zoo. He was behind all the
  accidents."</p>

  <p>Sir Oswald walked towards the door.</p>

  <p>"At last we can take action," he said briskly. "Your first step, Watson,
  is to establish the fact of a conspiracy. Once that is proved, any other
  charge which might be brought"&mdash;he stressed his words&mdash;"would have
  little chance of success. With your permission, I will ring up Hogarth and
  get him to fix the earliest possible interview with the man Browning, at the
  hospital. He'll probably be still up. It's not yet twelve."</p>

  <p>His words seemed to ring a bell in Ann's brain. Before she could obey its
  summons, Sir Oswald spoke again.</p>

  <p>"After I've dated Hogarth I will ring up the police."</p>

  <p>"The police?" cried Victoria.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Dr. Pybus. It will be your chance to explain."</p>

  <p>Victoria turned on Sir Benjamin and spoke viciously.</p>

  <p>"If I explain, you'll be sorry you started this. When Richard promised me
  five thousand, he pointed out that I was safeguarded, because <i>you</i>
  signed the cheque. He knew he could work it when you were half-drunk. So you
  see, you can't rub me out without getting rubbed out yourself, as the other
  partner in the conspiracy...Of course, I shall deny everything."</p>

  <p>"So you admit to a plot with Richard," said Sir Oswald triumphantly. "As
  to denying what you've said, Professor Blake has been putting it on record
  and we shall all be prepared to testify that it is the truth. I need hardly
  add that Professor Blake and I both bear characters of proven integrity."</p>

  <p>Ann noticed Lady Peacock's proud smile as she gazed at her husband but the
  others were watching Victoria whose eyes were dark as dead stars in her white
  face...Then she looked at the clock and saw that it was seven minutes to
  twelve.</p>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">Suddenly she realised that, after Victoria's admission,
  there was no question of her being a suspect and that she was free to leave
  the house. With a foretaste of liberation, she told herself joyously that
  within a few minutes, she would have broken free from every complication and
  gone forward into her own future...She tried to attract Sir Benjamin's
  attention but he was engrossed in the drama being played out within his four
  walls. As Victoria was still the central figure, holding the eyes of her
  audience, Ann lingered in the doorway and bid them all a mute farewell.
  Isabella&mdash;the jovial professor and his vivacious wife&mdash;the stately
  Peacocks&mdash;Sir Benjamin with his gigantic voice and wistful
  eyes&mdash;all these would soon be only memories.</p>

  <p>She closed the drawing-room door softly while she saw her own pathway
  stretching out before her and was filled with a surety of coming joy.
  Terrified lest someone should try to bring her back again, she stole into the
  cloakroom and drew on her fur coat and hat with nervous haste. When she
  reached the hall, she hurried to the foot of the stairs&mdash;only to turn
  away.</p>

  <p>That grand sweep of staircase had led to so many disappointments that she
  was superstitious about risking a last crowning one. She told herself that
  the right way to the tower-room was through the turret door...Creeping
  through the hall, she reached the front door safely and then stopped to look
  back at the theatrical hall and the pink azaleas.</p>

  <p>She heard the faint sound of voices from the drawing-room but already the
  people inside were fading to shadows and she was glad to get rid of them,
  just as she was grateful to have reached the end of a perilous adventure. She
  never wanted to return to Ganges or see any of her late companions
  again&mdash;even while she knew that something of the evening would remain
  with her always.</p>

  <p>As she stood on the portico, waiting for her eyes to get accustomed to the
  darkness, she was conscious that there would be times when a policeman on
  point duty would remind her oddly of a friendly elephant on guard, just as
  she was sure that she would rush to perform trifling services to
  severely-correct elderly women. She knew too that she would hurry past
  posters advertising circuses and zoos; she would never see dyed red hair
  without a queer wistful pang of affection; she would never read in the
  newspaper that a murderer had been hanged at eight o'clock, without shrinking
  from a memory of dead black eyes in a white enamel face.</p>

  <p>Blowing a kiss to Kitty, she stared out into the night. The stars had
  changed their course and those which had swung high were now dipping towards
  the horizon; but although the Guards were blotted out by clouds, she managed
  to find the dim pinprick of the Pole Star.</p>

  <p>When she reached the bottom of the flight of steps, she stopped to plan
  her journey. At the back of the house and towards the left of it her way
  would be blocked by the huge outcrop of the Tropical House and the other
  buildings&mdash;so she turned to the right. The wall of the house seemed to
  stretch on for a long way before her heels no longer sank into damp turf but
  struck on a hard surface.</p>

  <p>She thrilled to realise that she was back at the beginning of her
  wanderings&mdash;in a familiar paved courtyard with a sundial in the middle
  and a flagged path leading up to a lancet-shaped wooden door. As she turned
  its handle, an elephant trumpeted in the distance&mdash;a high jubilant
  note&mdash;as though sounding the charge. It rang in her ears as she obeyed
  its signal and plunged into the darkness of the lobby, where she
  stood&mdash;listening.</p>

  <p>She had completed the circle and was dipped again into a moment she had
  looked forward to for seven years...Suddenly she heard a movement from above
  as though someone was growing impatient of delay and she looked upwards, to
  see a faint glow from the top of the stairs.</p>

  <p>Someone had turned on the light again. At the sight of it, she began to
  rush up the stone steps, her heart hammering with hope and suspense. When she
  turned the last spiral, the open door revealed the tower-room and she knew
  that at long last she had reached the reunion.</p>

  <p>Smiling at her was a face which she had pictured so often during her years
  of exile. It had grown thinner and stronger but the hair grew in the familiar
  way and there were the same clear-cut corners to the mouth&mdash;the same
  laughter in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"Stephen!" she cried.</p>
