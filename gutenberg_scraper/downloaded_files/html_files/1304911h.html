  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">"THOMAS!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, m'lord."</p>

  <p>Thomas the footman waited, a look of concentrated interest on his
  unprepossessing face, whilst the pale man behind the big library desk sorted
  out a small pile of Treasury notes.</p>

  <p>The battered steel box from which they were taken was full to the brim
  with Bank and Treasury notes of all denominations in hopeless confusion.</p>

  <p>"Thomas!" absently.</p>

  <p>"Yes, m'lord."</p>

  <p>"Put this money in that envelope&mdash;not that one, you fool, the grey
  one. Is it addressed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, m'lord. 'Herr Lubitz, Frankfurterstrasse 35, Leipzig,' m'lord."</p>

  <p>"Lick it down, take it to the post office and register it. Is Mr Richard
  in his study?"</p>

  <p>"No, m'lord, he went out an hour ago."</p>

  <p>Harry Alford, 18th Earl of Chelford, sighed. He was on the right side of
  thirty, thin of face and pale as students are, his jet-black hair emphasising
  the pallor of his skin. The library in which he worked was a high-roofed
  building, the walls bisected by a gallery that ran round three sides of the
  room and was reached by a circular iron staircase in one corner of the
  apartment. From the roof to the floor every inch of wall space was covered
  with bookshelves, with this notable exception. Over the great stone fireplace
  was a full-length painting of a beautiful woman. None who had seen his
  lordship could make any mistake as to the relationship which existed between
  himself and that wild-eyed beauty. It was his mother; she had the same
  delicate features, the same raven hair and dark, fathomless eyes. Lady
  Chelford had been the most famous debutante of her time, and her tragic end
  had been the sensation of the early 'nineties. There was no other picture in
  the room.</p>

  <p>His eyes strayed to the portrait now. To Harry Alford, Fossaway Manor, for
  all its beauty and charm, was a poor casket for such a jewel.</p>

  <p>The footman in his sober black livery, his hair powdered white,
  lingered.</p>

  <p>"Is that all, m'lord?"</p>

  <p>"That is all," said his lordship gravely. Yet when the man had moved
  noiselessly to the door&mdash;"Thomas!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, m'lord."</p>

  <p>"I heard something by accident as you passed my window this morning with
  Filling the groom&mdash;er&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"He was telling me about the Black Abbot, m'lord." The pale face twitched
  spasmodically. Even in broad daylight, with the sun streaming through the
  stained windows and marking the parquet with arabesques of crimson and blue
  and amethyst, the very mention of the Black Abbot set his heart beating
  faster.</p>

  <p>"Any man in my employ who discusses the Black Abbot will be instantly
  dismissed. Will you tell your fellow-servants that, Thomas? A ghost! Great
  God! Are you all mad?"</p>

  <p>His face was red now, little veins swelled at his temples, and under the
  stream of anger his dark eyes seemed to recede into his head.</p>

  <p>"Not a word! You understand? It is a lie! A mischievous wicked lie to say
  that Fossaway is haunted! It is a trick played by some of the louts about the
  place. That will do!"</p>

  <p>He waved the bowing man from his presence and resumed his study of the
  black-lettered book that had arrived from Germany that morning.</p>

  <p>Once outside the library door, Thomas could afford to twist his sallow
  features to a grin. Only for a second, and then he became serious again.
  There must be nearly a thousand pounds in that cash-box, and Thomas had once
  served a three-year sentence for a tenth of that sum. Even Mr Richard Alford,
  who knew most things, was unaware of this interesting fact.</p>

  <p>Thomas had a letter to write, for he maintained a lucrative correspondence
  with one who had an especial interest in Fossaway Manor, but first he had to
  report the gist of the conversation to Mr Glover, the butler.</p>

  <p>"I don't care what his lordship says (and why he should tell a footman and
  not me, I don't know); there's a ghost, and all sorts of people have seen it!
  I wouldn't walk down Elm Drive alone at night for fifty million pounds!" This
  portly man shook a head that the years had silvered.</p>

  <p>"And his lordship believes it too. I wish he was married, that's what I
  wish. He'll be more sensible then!"</p>

  <p>"And we'd get rid of Mr Blooming Alford&mdash;eh, Mr Glover."</p>

  <p>The butler sniffed.</p>

  <p>"There's them that likes him and them that don't," said the oracle. "We've
  never had a cross word, Thomas&mdash;there's somebody at the door."</p>

  <p>Thomas hurried to the hall entrance and opened the big door. A girl was
  standing under the portico. She was pretty in a bold way, red of lips and
  bright of eye and dressed expensively.</p>

  <p>Thomas gave her a grin of recognition.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Miss Wenner&mdash;this is a bit of a surprise!"</p>

  <p>"Is his lordship in, Thomas?"</p>

  <p>The footman pursed his lips dubiously.</p>

  <p>"He is in, miss, but I'm afraid I can't take you in to him. Don't blame
  me, miss, it's Mr Alford's orders."</p>

  <p>"Mr Alford!" she sneered. "Do you mean to tell me that I've come all the
  way from London and can't see Lord Chelford?"</p>

  <p>But Thomas kept his hand on the door. He liked the girl, who, when she had
  been his lordship's secretary, had never given herself airs (the unpardonable
  sin of the servants' hall), and who always had a smile for the meanest of the
  domestic staff. He would gladly have admitted her and felt that his lordship
  would have been pleased to see her, but in the background somewhere hovered
  Dick Alford, a man of curt speech, who was not only capable of showing him
  the door but kicking him through it.</p>

  <p>"I'm very sorry, miss; but orders is orders, as you know."</p>

  <p>"I see!" she nodded ominously. "I'm to be turned away from what might have
  been my own door, Thomas."</p>

  <p>He tried to look his sympathy and succeeded in assuming an expression of
  imbecility. She smiled at him, shook hands with him graciously and turned
  away from the portico.</p>

  <p>"Miss Wenner," reported Thomas, "her that Alford fired because he thought
  his lordship was getting sweet on her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The library bell rang at that moment and Thomas hastened to answer the
  call.</p>

  <p>"Who was that lady&mdash;I saw her through the window?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Wenner, m'lord."</p>

  <p>A cloud passed over Harry Alford's face.</p>

  <p>"Did you&mdash;ask her to come in?"</p>

  <p>"No, m'lord; Mr Alford gave orders&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;yes. I had forgotten. Perhaps it is just as well. Thank
  you."</p>

  <p>He pulled down the green shade over his eyes, for even in the day he
  worked by artificial light, such was the gloom of the library, and resumed
  his study of the book.</p>

  <p>Yet his mind was not wholly concentrated on the work. Once he rose and
  walked up and down the library, his hands clasped before him, his chin on his
  breast. He stopped before the picture of his mother, sighed and walked back
  to the writing-table. There was a Press paragraph which he had cut out of a
  London newspaper, and this he read for the third time, not ill-pleased with
  the unaccustomed experience of finding himself the subject of newspaper
  comment, and yet irritated by the subject on which the paragraph was
  based.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">Chelfordbury, a sleepy Sussex village, is engaged in the thrilling sport
  of ghost-hunting. The Black Abbot of Fossaway has, after a period of
  quiescence, again made his appearance. The legend is that seven hundred years
  ago, Hubert of Redruth, Abbot of Chelfordbury, was assassinated by order of
  the second Earl of Chelford. Since then, from time to time, his "ghost" has
  been seen. During the past few years horrific stories of an Unseen Being that
  shrieked and howled demoniacally have been current in the county, but the
  noisy spook was not actually seen until last week.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">Fossaway Manor has other romances besides ghosts. Four hundred years ago a
  great treasure of gold was, according to legend, hidden somewhere on the
  estate; so effectively, in fact, that it has never been discovered since,
  although successive Earls of Chelford have searched diligently for the
  ancestral hoard.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">The present Earl of Chelford, who, by the way, is engaged to be married to
  Miss Leslie Gine, the only sister of Mr Arthur Gine, the well-known
  solicitor, informed our local representative that he had no doubt that the
  apparition of the Black Abbot was a practical joke in very doubtful taste on
  the part of the foolish youth of the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>He made as though to tear the paper, but thought better of it and put the
  cutting under a paper-weight.</p>

  <p>That reference to the practical jokers of the village was reassuring and
  might be a comfort when the night came and he needed encouragement.</p>

  <p>For Lord Chelford believed in the Black Abbot as religiously as he
  proclaimed his scepticism.</p>

  <p>His restless hand moved to the bell-push on his table.</p>

  <p>"Has Mr Richard returned?"</p>

  <p>"No, m'lord."</p>

  <p>Lord Chelford struck the table pettishly with his palm.</p>

  <p>"Where on earth does he get to in the mornings?" he asked querulously.</p>

  <p>Thomas, very wisely, pretended not to hear.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">THE reapers had laid low the last of the golden heads, and
  the sheaves stood like yellow tombstones on Racket Field. Beyond the field
  was Chelfordbury, where the grey old spire of the church came up from a
  velvety knoll of trees; beyond again, the green and white downs of Sussex,
  along the feet of which the railway runs.</p>

  <p>Dick Alford sat on a stile on the top of a little hillock and could see
  across the weald for fifteen miles. He could turn his head and take in the
  home farm and the green roofs and cupolas of Fossaway Manor, with its broad
  lawns and its clipped yew hedges. Neither cornfield nor down, manor-house nor
  pleasaunce, interested him for the moment. His eyes were fixed and his mind
  centred upon the girl who was walking quickly up the winding path that would
  bring her presently to where he sat.</p>

  <p>She was singing as she walked, the riding crop she carried whirling round
  and round like a drum-major's baton. His lips twitched to the ghost of a
  smile. Presently she would see him, and he wondered if she would be annoyed.
  He had never seen Leslie Gine except in such circumstances that her face was
  a pleasant mask and her manner conventionally charming. She had been nicely
  brought up and taught that all things are permissible except one: to make
  your equal feel foolish.</p>

  <p>The song ceased. She had seen him, but she did not check her pace and came
  quickly up the hill path, slashing at a nettle as she walked.</p>

  <p>"Peeping Tom!" she greeted him reproachfully.</p>

  <p>She was not so tall as the average English girl, but her slimness gave her
  height, and the supple movement of her hinted at greater strength than her
  slight figure suggested. Her face, delicately modelled, had the subtle
  refinement of her class. Small, beautiful hands and feet, a head finely
  poised, eyes of a deep grey, and a red mouth that smiled easily, Leslie Gine
  in rags would have been unmistakably a beautiful lady.</p>

  <p>Dick had seen her riding; she gripped the withers with her knees, jockey
  fashion, and was part of the horse. He had seen her on the polished dancing
  floor; there was lissom grace in every line. When he danced with her, he held
  in his arms a fragrant something that had more substance and character than
  he had thought. The hand on his shoulder was definitely placed, the body
  which his arm encircled was firm; he could feel the tiny muscles ripple under
  his hand.</p>

  <p>She stood now, her little black riding hat askew, her figure clad in neat
  black relieved by the lawn collar. Her neatly booted legs were planted
  stubbornly apart, one gloved hand holding her waist, the other swinging the
  crop. In her grey eyes was an imp of mischief that gleamed and danced all the
  merrier for the studied solemnity of every other feature.</p>

  <p>Dick Alford, from his vantage place on the top rail of the stile, chewed a
  blade of toddy grass between his white teeth and surveyed her
  approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Been riding, Leslie?"</p>

  <p>"I have been riding," she said gravely, and added: "a horse."</p>

  <p>He looked round innocently.</p>

  <p>"Where is the favoured animal?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>She looked at him suspiciously, but not a muscle of the tanned, lean face
  so much as twitched.</p>

  <p>"I dismounted to pick wild flowers and the beastie ran away. You saw him!"
  she accused.</p>

  <p>"I saw something that looked like a horse running towards Willow House,"
  he confessed calmly. "I thought he had thrown you."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"For that prevarication you can go and find him&mdash;I'll wait here," she
  said, and, when he got down from the stile with a groan: "I meant you to do
  that, anyway. The moment I saw you I said to myself: 'There's a lazy man who
  wants exercise!' Sisters-in-law-to-be have privileges."</p>

  <p>He winced a little at this. She may have noticed the cloud that came
  momentarily to his face, for she put out her hand and checked him.</p>

  <p>"One of the grooms can find him, Dick. He is such a hungry pig that he is
  certain to make for his stable. No, I don't mean the groom. Sit down; I want
  to talk to you."</p>

  <p>She swung up to the stile and took the place he had vacated.</p>

  <p>"Richard Alford, I don't think you are enjoying the prospect of my being
  the mistress of Fossaway House?"</p>

  <p>"Manor," he corrected.</p>

  <p>"Don't quibble&mdash;are you?"</p>

  <p>"I count the days," he said lightly.</p>

  <p>"Are you?"</p>

  <p>He took a battered silver case from his hip pocket, selected a cigarette
  and lit it.</p>

  <p>"My dear Leslie&mdash;" he began, but she shook her head. She was very
  serious now.</p>

  <p>"You think I will&mdash;interfere with things? With the management of the
  estate&mdash;I know poor Harry couldn't manage a small
  holding&mdash;with&mdash;oh, with all sorts of things, but I think you are
  wrong."</p>

  <p>He blew three smoke rings into the air before he answered.</p>

  <p>"I wish you would manage the estate," he said quietly. "It would be a
  blessing to me. No, I'm not worried about that. With your money&mdash;forgive
  the brutality&mdash;the estate will not count. A bailiff could manage it as
  well as any second son!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">HE spoke without bitterness, without a hint of self-pity,
  and she was silent. He was a child of a second marriage, and that had made it
  worse for him. When old Lord Chelford followed Dick's mother to the grave,
  the second son's portion was his. The estate, the title, the very car he had
  used as his own, passed from him. A tiny estate in Hertfordshire that brought
  two hundred a year, some old jewellery of his mother's and a thousand pounds
  came the way of the second son. And the thousand pounds had never been paid.
  In some mysterious fashion it had been swallowed up.</p>

  <p>Mr Arthur Gine had settled the estate. In all the circumstances Dick felt
  happier when he did not think of that thousand pounds. Yet, for some reason
  or other, he thought of it now, and as though she read his thoughts dimly,
  and associated his reserve with her brother, she asked:</p>

  <p>"You don't like Arthur, do you?"</p>

  <p>"What makes you say that?" he said, in genuine surprise. He had never
  betrayed his aversion to the dandified lawyer.</p>

  <p>"I know," she nodded wisely. "He exasperates me sometimes, and I can well
  imagine that a man like you would hate him."</p>

  <p>Dick smiled.</p>

  <p>"Harry doesn't hate him anyway, and he is the person who counts."</p>

  <p>She looked round at him, swinging the crop idly.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem real to me that I'm to be married at all&mdash;it was
  such a funny proposal, Dick, so polite, so formal, so&mdash;unreal! I think
  if it had come in any other way&mdash;" She shook her head.</p>

  <p>Dick wondered a little drearily how his brother would propose. Harry was
  something of a novice at the love game; once he had had a pretty secretary,
  and on a warm June afternoon Dick had interrupted what was tantamount to a
  proposal from the enterprising young lady. And the flustered Harry would have
  agreed to her matrimonial suggestions, only Dick had happened along&mdash;and
  the calculating Miss Wenner had left Fossaway Manor rather hurriedly. He
  remembered this happening.</p>

  <p>"I suppose if he had proposed in the conventional way you wouldn't have
  accepted him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said dubiously. "But it was quaint and&mdash;queer. I
  like Harry awfully. I have often wondered if he would like me if&mdash;" She
  did not finish her sentence.</p>

  <p>"If you weren't so horribly rich?" smiled Dick. "You're not paying him a
  very high compliment." She held out her arms and he lifted her down, though
  there seemed no necessity for it, as she was a very agile young person as a
  rule.</p>

  <p>"Dick," she said, as he crossed the stile and they walked side by side
  towards the main road, "what am I to do?"</p>

  <p>"About what?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"About Harry and everything."</p>

  <p>He had no answer to this.</p>

  <p>"Arthur is very keen on my marrying him," she said. "And really, I'm not
  averse&mdash;at least, I don't think so."</p>

  <p>"That is the worst of being a great heiress," he bantered.</p>

  <p>"I wonder?" Her brow wrinkled in a frown. "And am I a great heiress?"</p>

  <p>He stopped and looked at her in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you?"</p>

  <p>He seemed so shocked that she laughed.</p>

  <p>"I don't know; my uncle left me a lot of money years and years ago. I
  don't know how much&mdash;Arthur has managed my estate for years. I have all
  the money I need."</p>

  <p>"Then don't grouse!" he said crudely, and she laughed again.</p>

  <p>"I suppose most girls in my position have their marriages arranged in the
  way mine has been arranged, and until quite recently I have accepted the idea
  as part of the inevitable."</p>

  <p>"And why have you changed your mind now?" he asked bluntly, and saw the
  pink come into her face.</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>Her answer was very short, almost brusque.</p>

  <p>And then she saw the look in his eyes&mdash;the infinite yearning, the
  hopelessness of them. And in a flash there came to her a knowledge of
  herself.</p>

  <p>For some reason which she could not understand she became of a sudden
  breathless, and almost found a difficulty in speaking. She felt that the
  thump and thud of her heart must be audible to his ears, and strove
  desperately to recover her balance. Vividly before her eyes came the picture
  of her fiancé, the thin, irritable young man&mdash;the weakling with all that
  man needed in his hands, save manhood. A pitiable, nerve-racked creature, now
  pleading, now bullying&mdash;oblivious of the impression he made on the woman
  who was to share his life. And from this mental figure of him her eyes moved
  mechanically to the man by her side; calm, serene, radiant in his strength
  and self-reliance.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later she was walking back to Willow House, and in her heart
  she struggled with a problem that seemed well-nigh insoluble.</p>

  <p>Dick Alford, making his slow progress homeward, saw the lank figure of his
  brother waiting at the end of the elm drive.</p>

  <p>The wind flapped the skirts of his long frock-coat; standing, he stooped
  slightly and had a trick of thrusting forward his head, which gave him the
  appearance of a big, ungainly bird. His face was dark with anger, Dick saw as
  he came up with him.</p>

  <p>"I deputise many duties to you, Richard, but I'll do my own love-making,
  understand that!"</p>

  <p>The blood came into Dick Alford's face, but he showed no other sign of his
  hurt or anger.</p>

  <p>"I will not have it&mdash;you understand?" Lord Chelford's voice was
  shrill with childish fury. "I will not have you interfering in my private
  affairs. You sent one girl away from me, you shall not take Leslie!"</p>

  <p>"I am not&mdash;" began his brother hotly.</p>

  <p>"You are&mdash;you are! You don't want me to marry! I am not a fool, Dick!
  You stand next in the line of succession! I am going to marry Leslie Gine
  &mdash; understand that! You shall not break that engagement."</p>

  <p>For a moment the brutality, the injustice of the accusation, left the
  younger man white and shaking, and then, with a supreme effort, he laughed.
  Scenes such as this were of almost daily occurrence, but never before had
  Harry Alford gone so far. In ten minutes the storm would pass, and Harry
  would be his old lovable self, but for the moment it was bitterly hard to
  bear.</p>

  <p>"Why do you say such horrible things?" he said. "I got rid of Wenner
  because she was not the wife for you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You didn't want me to marry! You are waiting for my shoes, a dead man's
  shoes!" almost screamed the elder son. "The last thing in the world you want
  to see is a new Countess of Chelford. You know it, you know it!"</p>

  <p>Dick Alford was silent. God knew his brother spoke the truth! It would be
  a woeful day for him when Harry Alford brought a wife to this great house to
  share the dreadful secret which hung like a cloud over Fossaway Manor.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">DICK ALFORD was in the little study where he usually worked,
  a business-like room filled with filing cabinets and deed-boxes. The French
  windows giving to the lawn were open, for though it was September the night
  was warm, and he was working in his shirt-sleeves, a pipe gripped between his
  teeth, his eyes protected from the overhead light by a big green shade that
  he wore affixed by a band to his head. If there was a resemblance between
  Lord Chelford and his mother, not even the keenest observer could trace in
  Dick Alford the slightest likeness to his half-brother. He was a creature of
  the open, a six-foot athlete, broad of shoulder and slim of flank, and his
  tanned face spoke of a life spent on the windy downs. His blue eyes surveyed
  the footman with a quizzical smile as he pushed his battered old typewriter
  aside, relit his pipe and stretched himself.</p>

  <p>"Black Abbot? Good lord! Have you seen him, Thomas?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I have not seen him. But Mr Cartwright, the grocer down in
  Chelford village&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He gave a graphic narrative of Mr Cartwright's horror, amazement and
  confusion.</p>

  <p>"They telephoned up from the 'Red Lion' to ask if his lordship had heard
  anything about it." Even Thomas, who believed in nothing except Thomas,
  shivered. "It is the first time he has been seen for years according to all
  accounts, though he has been heard howling and moaning. Nobody knows who set
  fire to the vicarage when the parson was away at the seaside&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That will do, Thomas. As to Cartwright, he was drunk," said Dick
  cheerily, "or else he saw a shadow."</p>

  <p>He glanced out at the lawn, bathed in the blue-white rays of a full
  moon.</p>

  <p>"You can see things in the moonlight that never were on land or sea. I
  understood that his lordship said that the Black Abbot was not to be
  discussed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then shut up!" said Dick.</p>

  <p>Pipe in mouth, he strolled across the hall into the dimly lit library.</p>

  <p>The three electroliers that hung from the roof were dark. Only the two
  green-shaded reading-lamps that flanked each side of the desk were alight,
  and these intensified the gloom. Dick closed the door behind him and lounged
  over towards the desk, pulling a chair behind him.</p>

  <p>Chelford frowned at the sight of his brother.</p>

  <p>"Really, Dick," he said irritably. "I wish to heaven you wouldn't loaf
  about the place in shirt and breeches. It looks fearfully bad."</p>

  <p>"It feels fearfully cool," said Dick, sitting down. "Will your nerves
  sustain the smell of a bit of honest 'baccy?"</p>

  <p>Lord Chelford moved uncomfortably in his chair. Then, reaching out his
  hand, he snicked open a gold box and took out a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"My pipe against your stinkers for a hundred pounds!" said Dick, with a
  cheery smile. "Cigarettes I can stand, but scented cigarettes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you don't like them, Dick, you can go out," grumbled his lordship
  fretfully. And then in his abrupt way: "Did you see this newspaper
  cutting?"</p>

  <p>He pulled the paper from under the crystal weight and Dick skimmed the
  lines.</p>

  <p>"We are getting into the public eye, Harry," he said, "but there is
  nothing about me, which is unkind."</p>

  <p>"Don't be stupid. How did that get into the papers?"</p>

  <p>"How does anything get into the papers?" asked Dick lazily. "Our spook is
  almost as useful as a Press agent."</p>

  <p>Harry snapped round on him.</p>

  <p>"Can't you take this seriously? Don't you see that it is worrying me to
  death? You know the state of my nerves&mdash;you have no sympathy, Dick,
  you're just as hard as rock! Everybody seems to hate the sight of you."</p>

  <p>Dick pulled at his pipe glumly.</p>

  <p>"That is my unfortunate character. I am afraid I am getting efficient.
  That is the only way I can account for my unpopularity. It keeps me awake at
  nights&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't fool, for heaven's sake!"</p>

  <p>"I'm serious now," murmured Dick, closing his eyes; "try me with a
  hymn!"</p>

  <p>Harry Chelford turned away with a gesture of utter weariness, fingered the
  manuscript at his hand and gazed from his brother to the door. It was a
  gesture of dismissal and Dick rose.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think you've done enough work for tonight, Harry?" Dick asked
  gently. "You look absolutely all in."</p>

  <p>"I never felt better in my life," said the other emphatically.</p>

  <p>Dick slewed round his head to read the printed page from which his elder
  brother had been copying, and saw at once that his effort was in vain; the
  book was written in Old German, and Dick's linguistic abilities ended at a
  mastery of restaurant French. Lord Chelford put down the book with a sigh and
  sat back in his padded chair.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think I'm a fool wasting my time on this"&mdash;he raised
  his hand towards the serried shelves&mdash;"when I could be having a very
  amusing time with Leslie?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think you might be more profitably employed out of doors. Really,
  for a bridegroom-to-be, you're the worst slacker I've ever struck."</p>

  <p>There was a superiority in Harry Chelford's smile.</p>

  <p>"Happily, Leslie knows she is marrying a bookworm and not an athlete," he
  said, and, rising, walked over to where Dick was sitting and dropped his hand
  on his shoulder. "What would you say if I told you that I was halfway to
  discovering the real Chelford treasure?"</p>

  <p>Dick knew exactly what he would say, but replied diplomatically.</p>

  <p>"I should say you were three parts on the way to discovering the
  philosopher's stone," he said.</p>

  <p>But his brother was serious. He paced up and down the long library, his
  hands behind him, his chin on his breast.</p>

  <p>"I expected you to say that," he said. "I should have been rather
  surprised if you hadn't. But the Chelford treasure has an existence, Dick,
  and somewhere with it is the greatest treasure of all!"</p>

  <p>His brother listened patiently. He knew by heart the story of the thousand
  bars of pure gold, each bar weighing thirty-five pounds. The legend of the
  Chelford treasure was inseparable from the Chelford estate.</p>

  <p>Harry walked quickly to his desk, pulled open a drawer and took out a
  small vellum-covered book. The pages were yellow with age and covered with
  writing that had faded to a pale green.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said, and began reading.</p>

  <p>"On the fifteenth of the month, the same being the feast day of St James,
  came Sir Walter Hythe Kt from his cruise in the Spanish seas, for the cost of
  which I raised first three thousand eight hundred pounds and eight thousand
  pounds from Bellitti the Lombard, and Sir Walter Hythe brought with him on
  ten wagons one thousand ingots of gold each of thirty-five pounds weight
  which he had taken from the two Spanish ships Esperanza and Escurial, and
  these ingots he shall put away in the safe place if yet the weather be dry
  and the drought continue, though rain is near at hand, to judge by the
  portents, deeming it wise not to inform my lord Burleigh of the gold because
  of the Queen's Majesty and her covetousness. Also he brought the crystal
  flask of Life Water which was given to Don Cortes by the priest of the Aztec
  people, a drop of which upon the tongue will revive even the dead, this being
  sworn to by Fra Pedro of Sevilla. This I shall hide with great care in the
  secret place where the gold will be stored. To Sir Walter Hythe Kt I had
  given permission that he keep for himself one hundred bars of like weight,
  and this he did, thanking me civilly and sailed off from Chichester in his
  ship the Good Father, which ship was wrecked on the Kentish coast, Sir Walter
  Hythe, his shipmaster and all his company perishing. Such was his terrible
  misfortune. As for myself, being in some danger because of the part I have
  taken in promoting the welfare of my true sovereign lady, Mary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lord Chelford looked up and met the steady eyes of his brother.</p>

  <p>"The writing ends there," he said. "I am certain that he was not
  interrupted by the arrival of Elizabeth's soldiers to arrest him for his
  share in the conspiracy to put Mary on the throne. He must have had time to
  secrete the treasure. Where is the crystal flask?"</p>

  <p>"Where rather is the gold?" asked the practical Dick. "If I know anything
  about Queen Elizabeth, she bagged it! Nobody ever found it&mdash;for four
  hundred years our respected forefathers have been searching for this
  gold&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lord Chelford made an angry gesture.</p>

  <p>"Gold&mdash;gold&mdash;gold! You think of nothing else! Curse the gold!
  Find it and keep it. It is the flask I want!" His voice sank to a whisper,
  his face had grown suddenly moist. "Dick, I'm afraid of death! God! You don't
  know how afraid! The fear of it haunts me day and night&mdash;I sit here
  counting the hours, wondering at which my spirit will go from me! You'll
  laugh&mdash;at that&mdash;laugh, laugh!"</p>

  <p>But Dick Alford's face was set, unsmiling.</p>

  <p>"I do not laugh&mdash;but can't you see, Harry, that such a thing as an
  elixir of life is preposterous?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" Lord Chelford's eyes were shining. "Why shouldn't this discovery
  have been made by the ancient civilisations? Why is it more wonderful than
  wireless telegraphy or the disintegration of atoms? Thirty years ago flying
  was regarded as a miracle. The flask&mdash;I want the flask of Life Water!
  The gold&mdash;throw it into the road&mdash;let the poor devils take it who
  want it. I want life&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;life and the end of
  fear."</p>

  <p>He dropped heavily into his chair and wiped his streaming forehead.</p>

  <p>"The End of Fear!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>Dick listened, his eyes never leaving his brother's face. And this was to
  be Leslie Gine's husband. He shivered at the thought.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">IF the Honourable Richard Fallington Alford had been
  regarded by the compilers of such volumes as being sufficiently important to
  have his biography enshrined in a popular work of reference, his life's work,
  his hobby and his recreation would be described as "looking after the
  Chelford estate." His bailiffs said he knew every blade of grass; the tenant
  farmers swore he could price a standing crop to the last penny of its worth.
  He knew Fossaway Manor, its strength and weakness, better than the estate
  architect&mdash;could point out where the foundations were scamped by the
  Elizabethan builders. He could trace the walls of the old castle which
  Richard of York had burnt and razed, beheading the fourth earl for his
  treachery under the great archway, one crumbling pier of which still showed
  its grey and battered head above the roses that now surrounded it. He gave to
  the broad lands of Chelford a loyal and passionate devotion which any
  mistress might envy.</p>

  <p>In the chill of an autumnal morning, when mist blanketed the hollows and a
  pale sun was struggling through thin clouds, he strolled across the park
  towards the abbey ruins. There was little of them left. A truncated tower
  wrecked by lightning; a high, arched space where an oriel window had once
  flamed; mounds of scattered stones left where Cromwell's soldiers had
  overturned them; and, under the carpet of grass, a "feel" of solid
  pavement.</p>

  <p>He drew at his pipe as he stepped out, and the tobacco smelt sweet and
  wholesome in the cold air.</p>

  <p>He was on his way to the home farm, and his errand was a prosaic one. A
  cow had died in the night, and his cowman had reported symptoms of cattle
  fever.</p>

  <p>The familiar ruins showed up ahead, the half-arch, like a huge question
  mark, arrested his eye and raised again the well-argued problem of
  restoration. Some day, when the Chelford ship came home; when that coal vein
  was proved, or when Harry had a rich wife.</p>

  <p>This was an unpleasant thought. His lips curled in a grimace of
  distaste.</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>A figure was walking amongst the ruins&mdash;a woman. Her back was towards
  him and she was obviously unaware of his presence. Something about her figure
  seemed familiar&mdash;Dick turned from the path and walked towards her.</p>

  <p>Evidently she did not hear him, for when he spoke she started, uttered a
  little scream and turned a frightened face to him.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Miss Wenner," he said politely. "You are up and about very
  early."</p>

  <p>There was no need for him to wonder whether this girl had ever forgiven
  him for the very painful interview that had preceded her retirement.
  Recognising him, her eyes blazed with hate.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr Alford." She was civil enough. "I'm staying in the
  village and I thought I would like to come up and see the old place."</p>

  <p>He nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"You had a similar thought yesterday," he said, "and tried to see my
  brother."</p>

  <p>"Well?" defiantly.</p>

  <p>"I gave you to understand, Miss Wenner, that we should all be much happier
  if you never again passed the lodge gates," he said quietly. "I hate saying
  this to any woman, but you ought to be the first to recognise how very
  uncomfortable you make me feel. I thought you would apprehend this."</p>

  <p>"Apprehend" was a stilted word, but he could think of no other.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" The colour had deepened in her face.
  "Is&mdash;that&mdash;so?"</p>

  <p>"That is so," he nodded.</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a while and her lips curved.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I've annoyed the family chaperon," she sneered.</p>

  <p>He could admire, in a detached way, her wholesome good looks; could even
  admire her courage. Her wrathful eyes were fixed on his, the break in her
  voice betrayed the fury she strove to conceal. As for Dick Alford, he felt a
  brute.</p>

  <p>"I'm extremely sorry if you don't like my calling," she said, her voice
  razor-sharp and tremulous, "but I think the least Lord Chelford could have
  done was to see me, considering I've worked for him for three years, and
  after all that has passed between us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The only thing that passed between you, Miss Wenner, was your weekly
  wages," said Dick, with maddening calmness.</p>

  <p>But now he had taxed her to the limit of endurance.</p>

  <p>"He asked me to marry him, and I would have married him if you hadn't put
  your spoke in!" she said shrilly. "I could get thousands and thousands out of
  him for breach of promise if I wasn't a lady! You second sons and hangers-on
  poisoned his mind against me! You ought to be downright ashamed of yourself,
  you good-for-nothing penniless pauper!"</p>

  <p>Dick was faintly amused at the redundancy.</p>

  <p>"You've wrecked and ruined my life," the pretty virago went on, "with your
  interference, and after all the work I've done! After all them&mdash;I mean
  those hours I've spent with his lordship workin' at the Treasure, an' he told
  me I was the most helpful secretary he'd ever had&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He let her talk herself to a sobbing incoherence.</p>

  <p>"All this may be true," he said soothingly, "and probably is. The point
  is, your presence here is a little&mdash;indelicate."</p>

  <p>Seeing her look round over her shoulder as she was talking, he had taken a
  quick survey of the ruins, expecting to discover that she had a companion.
  But there was nobody in sight. The ground sloped steeply from where he stood
  to the little Ravensrill, the broad brook which had for a thousand years
  marked the boundary of the manor. Unless somebody was concealed behind the
  fallen masonry she was alone.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you want me to clear out now," she gulped, and he inclined his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I will walk with you to Fontwell Cutting&mdash;that is the nearest way to
  the village," he said, and she was too much occupied with her manufactured
  misery to resent his offer.</p>

  <p>What had she been doing in the abbey ruins so early in the morning? He
  knew that it was useless to ask her.</p>

  <p>As they passed down the steep path to the road she spoke over her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't marry him for a million pounds!" she said viciously. "He is
  going to marry Leslie Gine, isn't he? I wish him joy!"</p>

  <p>"I will convey your kind message," he said ironically, an indiscreet
  rejoinder, for it roused the devil in her.</p>

  <p>"Mind he doesn't lose her, that's all!" she screamed. "I know! Everybody
  knows! You want her money too&mdash;the second son's in love with her &mdash;
  that's a nice look-out for Harry Alford!"</p>

  <p>He sat swinging his legs over the edge of the bluff, watching her till she
  was out of sight.</p>

  <p>Everybody knew that he loved Leslie Gine! And he only knew it himself at
  that moment!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">IN all the city of London there was perhaps no office more
  elegant than that in which Mr Arthur Gine spent his leisurely business hours.
  It was a large room, panelled in white wood, with pink-shaded wall brackets
  of frosted silver. Its floor was covered with a deep rose carpet into which
  the feet sank as into an old lawn; and such furnishing as the room held was
  of the most costly description. Visitors and clients who had business with
  this dainty lawyer were warned not to smoke in his sacred presence. The
  windows were doubled to keep out the noises of Holborn; there were exterior
  sun-blinds to exclude the fugitive rays of pale sunlight which occasionally
  bathed the City; and long velvet curtains, in harmony with the carpet, to
  shut out the horrid world that roared and palpitated outside Mr Gine's
  exquisite chamber. In this room was a faint aroma of roses&mdash;he was
  partial to the more expensive varieties of perfume, and had a standing order
  with the best of the Grasse houses.</p>

  <p>He was a fair man with an unblemished skin and a small yellow moustache; a
  credit to his hosier and shirt-maker. His wasp-waisted morning coat fitted
  him without the suspicion of a wrinkle; his grey waistcoat, the severe dark
  trousers with the thinnest of white stripes, the patent shoes, the exact
  cravat, were all parts of a sartorial symmetry.</p>

  <p>Mr Gine seldom appeared in the courts. His head clerk, a grey hard man of
  fifty, who was generally supposed by Mr Gine's brother solicitors to be the
  brains of the business, prepared most of the briefs, interviewed the majority
  of clients, leaving to his employer the most important.</p>

  <p>On a bright morning in the early days of September, Mr Gine's big Rolls
  glided noiselessly to the kerb, the youthful footman seated by the side of
  the driver sprang out and opened the door, and Arthur Gine stepped daintily
  forth. There was a small white rose in his buttonhole, and the passer-by who
  saw him, noting the perfect shine of his silk hat, the glitter of his patent
  shoes, and the ebony stick that he carried in his gloved hand, thought he was
  a bridegroom stopping on his way to church.</p>

  <p>He entered the tiny electric lift and was whisked up to the first floor. A
  porter opened his door with a little bow and Arthur walked in, followed by
  the servitor, who took his hat, gloves and cane, and disappeared with them to
  an inner room. Mr Gine sat down at his desk, glanced at the letters that had
  been left opened for his inspection, and pushed them aside. He pressed an
  onyx bell-push twice, and in a few seconds his hard-faced managing clerk came
  in, carrying a wad of papers in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Close the door, Gilder. What are these?"</p>

  <p>Gilder threw the papers on the polished table.</p>

  <p>"Mostly writs," he said curtly.</p>

  <p>"For me?"</p>

  <p>Gilder nodded, and Arthur Gine turned over the papers idly.</p>

  <p>"There is going to be trouble if they give judgment against you for some
  of these," said Gilder. "Up to now I've managed to keep them out of court,
  but there are at least three of these which must be paid. I haven't had a
  chance of speaking to you since I came back from my holidays. Did you lose
  much at Goodwood?"</p>

  <p>"Eight or nine thousand," said Arthur Gine lightly. "It may have been more
  or less."</p>

  <p>"That means you don't know because you haven't paid," said Gilder
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>"I paid a few&mdash;the more pressing," the other hastened to assure him.
  "What are these?"</p>

  <p>He fingered the writs again with his beautifully manicured hand.</p>

  <p>"One of them is very serious indeed," said Gilder, picking it out from the
  rest. "The trustees of the Wellman estate are suing you for three thousand
  pounds&mdash;the loan you had from Wellman."</p>

  <p>"Can't you fix them?"</p>

  <p>Gilder shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I can't fix trustees&mdash;you know that. This is going to look ugly if
  it comes into court."</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing ugly about a loan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You were Wellman's lawyer," interrupted Gilder.</p>

  <p>"And he was not capable of managing his affairs. I tell you that will look
  ugly, and the Law Society will be asking questions. You'll have to raise
  money to settle this case out of court."</p>

  <p>"What are the others?" asked Arthur Gine sulkily.</p>

  <p>"There's one for twelve hundred pounds, furniture supplied to Willow
  House, and another from the vendor of Willow House for balance of purchase-
  money unpaid."</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine leaned back in his chair, took out a gold toothpick and chewed
  it.</p>

  <p>"What is the full amount?"</p>

  <p>"About six thousand pounds," said Gilder, gathering up the writs. "Can't
  you raise it?"</p>

  <p>His employer shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A bill?"</p>

  <p>"Who is going to back it?" asked the lawyer, looking up.</p>

  <p>Gilder scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"What about Lord Chelford?" he asked.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">ARTHUR GINE laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"And what do you imagine Chelford would say if I went to him with such a
  proposal? You seem to forget, my dear fellow, that to Chelford I am the
  brother of a young lady who on her twenty-fifth birthday inherits the greater
  part of a million pounds. I'm not only the brother, but I am her trustee.
  Besides which, I am managing his mother's estate. What would he think if I
  tried? Chelford's a fool, but he's not such a fool as that, and I would
  remind you that all his business affairs are in the hands of the Second
  Son."</p>

  <p>"You mean Alford&mdash;why do you call him that?"</p>

  <p>"He's always been known as the Second Son since he was a child," said the
  other impatiently. "He is a shrewd devil, never forget that, Gilder. I don't
  know whether or not he suspects that I'm a fake, and that Leslie's fortune is
  a myth, but there have been times when he has asked some deucedly
  uncomfortable questions."</p>

  <p>"Is the fortune a myth?" asked Gilder, and his companion looked at him
  slyly.</p>

  <p>"You ought to know, my friend," he said. "We have been living on it for
  eight years! The croupiers of Monte Carlo have raked into their treasury
  quite a lot of it&mdash;various bookmakers I could mention have built
  handsome villas out of it. A myth. It wasn't a myth ten years ago. It was two
  hundred thousand pounds short of a myth? But today&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He spread out his hands and eyed the writs with a whimsical smile.</p>

  <p>"What do you expect to get from Chelford&mdash;he has no money?" asked
  Gilder.</p>

  <p>Mr Gine chuckled.</p>

  <p>"You may be sure that before I went to the expense and trouble of
  buying&mdash;or nearly buying&mdash;a house adjoining Chelford's place, and
  before I took the trouble to bring Leslie and him into touch, I took the
  elementary precaution of sizing up his position. He is comparatively poor,
  because that brother of his will sell none of the estates. He has the family
  obsession &mdash; their motto is 'Hold Fast.' Harry Chelford is realisable at
  a quarter of a million&mdash;apart from the buried treasure!"</p>

  <p>They both laughed at this.</p>

  <p>"You've been lucky up to a point," said Gilder seriously. "It was luck to
  inherit his legal business&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A clerk came in with some letters to sign at this moment, and, after he
  was gone: "Does your sister still think she is an heiress?" asked Gilder.</p>

  <p>"She has that illusion," replied the other coolly. "Of course she thinks
  so! You don't imagine Leslie would lend herself to that kind of ramp, do
  you?"</p>

  <p>He took a pen from the silver tray before him, dipped it into the ink,
  and, drawing a sheet of paper towards him, scribbled down the figures.</p>

  <p>"Six thousand pounds is a lot of money," he said. "I lost three times that
  amount when Black Satin was beaten a short head in the Drayton Handicap. The
  only thing to do is to rush the wedding."</p>

  <p>"What about the Yorkshire property?" suggested the managing clerk.</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"I put a man in to buy it. I could have made twenty thousand profit on
  that. There's coal in abundance; that I have proved. But the Second Son was
  on the job, damn him!"</p>

  <p>There was a long silence.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" asked Gilder.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I'm at my wits' end." Arthur Gine threw down the pen. "The
  position is exquisite torture to a man of my sensibility. Can't you suggest
  anything?"</p>

  <p>"Give me five minutes," said Gilder, and went out.</p>

  <p>As Gilder was making his way to his own office, a clerk handed him a
  letter. It was addressed to him personally, in an illiterate hand. Behind the
  door of his office bureau he opened the envelope.</p>

  <p>The letter began without any preliminary.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">His lordship is still working on the Treasure. He had an
  old book sent to him from Germany last Tuesday, written by a German who was
  in this country hundreds of years ago. I cannot read the title because of the
  funny printing, which is like Old English. His lordship has also had a plan
  sent to him from a London bookseller of Fossaway Manor. His lordship's
  brother, Mr Alford, has sold Red Farm to Mr Leonard for £3500 (here Mr Gilder
  smiled). Miss Gine came to tea yesterday with his lordship and Mr Alford, and
  afterwards Miss Gine and his lordship went for a walk in the home park. There
  is some talk about the Black Abbot having been seen near the old abbey. He
  was seen by Thomas Elwin, the half-witted son of Elwin, his lordship's
  cowman, but nobody takes any notice of this. He has now been seen by Mr
  Cartwright, the grocer. His lordship has had an offer for his Yorkshire
  estate, but I heard Mr Alford advise him not to sell, as he was sure there
  was coal on it.</p><br>

  <p>Gilder nodded, understanding just how his employer's plan had fallen
  through.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">...When I was taking tea into the library I heard his
  lordship say that he wanted the wedding to take place in October, but Miss
  Gine said she would like it after Christmas. His lordship said that he didn't
  mind because he was so busy. Mr Alford said he thought that the marriage
  settlement should be fixed by Sampson &amp; Howard, who were the old Lord
  Chelford's solicitors, but his lordship said that he thought the settlement
  had better be in Mr Gine's hands. I did not hear any more because Mr Alford
  told me to get out. Miss Wenner, who used to be his lordship's secretary,
  came down from London yesterday, but Mr Alford has given orders that she is
  not to be admitted. His lordship did not see her&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>Mr Fabrian Gilder's spy reported other minor matters which were less
  interesting. He read the letter again, put it in his pocket and was busy at
  his desk for five minutes.</p>

  <p>He came back to find his employer leaning over his desk, his head between
  his hands, and laid a slip of paper before him.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" asked Gine, startled.</p>

  <p>"A six-months bill for seven thousand pounds. I've put an extra thousand
  in for luck," said Gilder coolly.</p>

  <p>Gine read the document quickly. It was a bill, and required only his
  signature and that of Harry, Earl of Chelford, to make it convertible into
  solid cash.</p>

  <p>"I dare not do it&mdash;I simply dare not do it!"</p>

  <p>"Why tell him it's a bill at all?" asked Gilder. "You can get him by
  himself, spin a yarn&mdash;you have a fertile imagination&mdash;but I suggest
  to you that you tell him you need his signature to release some of your
  sister's property, and once his name is on the back of the bill&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine looked up sharply. Was it a coincidence that this excuse
  should be suggested? There was nothing in the head clerk's face to suggest
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>"But when it comes due?" he asked irresolutely, as he turned the document
  over and over in his hands.</p>

  <p>"In six months' time he'll be married, and if things aren't better with
  you, he'll either have to meet the bill or hush the matter up."</p>

  <p>The eyes of the two men met.</p>

  <p>"You're on the edge of ruin, my young friend," said Gilder, "and I'm
  rather concerned. If you go down, my livelihood disappears."</p>

  <p>How true this was, Arthur learnt one bitter day.</p>

  <p>"You make a deuced sight more out of it than I do," he grumbled, as he
  wrote the name of a bank across the face of the bill.</p>

  <p>"I spend less than you, and when I get money I know how to keep it."</p>

  <p>"You might even raise the sum yourself," said his employer, with a feeble
  attempt at jocularity.</p>

  <p>"I might," said Gilder grimly, "but, as I said before, I know how to take
  care of my own, and lending money to you is not my notion of a good
  investment."</p>

  <p>He had been out of the room only a few minutes when he came back and,
  closing the door carefully behind him: "Do you know a Miss Wenner?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Mr Gine frowned.</p>

  <p>"Yes. What does she want?"</p>

  <p>"She says she must see you on an urgent personal matter. Is she one of
  your&mdash;friends?"</p>

  <p>Arthur shook his head.</p>

  <p>"N-no&mdash;I have met her. She was Chelford's secretary. Can't you find
  out what she wants?"</p>

  <p>"I've tried, but it is a matter personal to you. Do you want to see
  her?&mdash;I can easily stall her."</p>

  <p>Arthur thought for a while. She might have something important to tell
  him.</p>

  <p>"Ask her to come in," he said.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later Mary Wenner came into the room and greeted him with a
  familiar nod.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear, this is an unexpected pleasure. You are getting prettier
  every time I see you."</p>

  <p>She accepted the flattery as her right, and sat on the edge of his
  desk.</p>

  <p>"I've been down to Fossaway, Arthur," she said.</p>

  <p>"Silly girl," he smiled. "But I thought that affair was all over and done
  with. You've got to be good, Mary. Chelford is going to marry my sister."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that grand! And I'm not surprised. I saw you working when I was at
  Fossaway."</p>

  <p>She slipped down from the desk and dropped both her hands on his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Arthur, I'm tired of stenogging! And I want like sin to get back on that
  cold-blooded hound Dick Alford. I've been fired out once for proposing to a
  man&mdash;I'm going to take a second chance. We've been good pals,
  Arthur."</p>

  <p>He murmured something in his alarm.</p>

  <p>"Listen&mdash;don't turn down a good thing. You can marry me and I'll
  bring you a bigger dowry than your sister will take to Harry Alford."</p>

  <p>He stared at her.</p>

  <p>"You? Dowry?" he stammered.</p>

  <p>She nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"Marry me, and I'll take you to the place where you can lay your hands on
  fifteen tons of Spanish gold&mdash;the Chelford treasure! Two and a half
  million pounds!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">FIFTEEN tons of gold! Two and a half millions sterling!</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine stared at the girl incredulously. But she was making no idle
  statement, and that she at least believed what she said was clear from her
  flushed face and shining eyes. For a second he was speechless.</p>

  <p>"Fifteen tons of gold?" He frowned and smiled at the same time. "You're
  mad, Mary!"</p>

  <p>"Mad, am I?" She nodded vigorously. "Oh, indeed, I daresay you think so,
  but you won't be thinking that very long! I have found the Chelford treasure,
  I tell you."</p>

  <p>He sat down heavily in his chair, his startled eyes still fixed upon hers.
  He was for the moment inarticulate.</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" he managed to say at last. "There is no Chelford treasure!
  Living so long in the same house with Harry Alford has made you as mad as
  he!"</p>

  <p>She walked slowly to the desk and, with her palms on the ledge, leant down
  over him.</p>

  <p>"You think that, do you?" she asked in a steady voice. "I was three years
  Lord Chelford's secretary, and it's true I had this treasure stuff dinned
  into me from morning till night. The sight of a black-lettered book makes me
  ill even now, and the plans of Fossaway Manor that I've studied&mdash;well, I
  don't like to think of them! I've lived with this treasure for three years,
  Arthur, and there have been times when I could have screamed when it was
  mentioned. I got so that I came to like Dick Alford just because he never
  spoke to me about it. And then one day there came a bundle of plans from
  London&mdash;Harry had a standing order with an old bookseller to send him
  anything he could find about Chelfordbury or Fossaway Manor. Harry had gone
  up to town that morning and I had no other work to do, so I went through
  these dusty old sheets to index them. And on the third sheet I found
  something that made me open my eyes."</p>

  <p>"What was it?" asked Arthur carelessly.</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a quiet smile.</p>

  <p>"A lot has to happen before I tell you that," she said. "Arthur, if I give
  you this, or your share of this, will you marry me?"</p>

  <p>Arthur looked at her steadily.</p>

  <p>"If you can put me next to a million, or half a million," he said slowly,
  "I would marry you if you were the plainest woman on the face of the earth!
  instead of being the bonniest, prettiest little angel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can keep that stuff for later," she said practically. She opened her
  handbag and took out a paper, and he watched with fascinated interest. If he
  expected the secret of the Chelford treasure to be laid before him in
  writing, he was to be disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I'm not much of a lawyer," said Mary, as she smoothed out the paper and
  laid it on his blotting-pad, "but I think this is binding on both sides."</p>

  <p>He took up the paper with a wry face and read it.</p>

  <p>In consideration of receiving one-half of the Chelford treasure, I, Arthur
  Gine, of Willow House, Chelfordbury, Sussex, agree to bind myself to Mary
  Agnes Wenner in the bonds of holy matrimony within one month of the treasure
  being found and divided.</p>

  <p>"Is that in order?" she asked, watching his face.</p>

  <p>He put the paper down.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl&mdash;" he began, in his suavest manner.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Arthur." She perched herself on the edge of the desk. "This is
  the time for 'yes's' and 'no's,' for 'I will's' and 'I won't's'! I'm not in
  love with you and you're not in love with me. But I want a home and a
  position. I may not be a lady, but I am ladylike, and I have lived long
  enough with swagger people to make no mistakes. Is it yes or is it no?"</p>

  <p>Arthur looked at the paper again.</p>

  <p>"Does it strike you," he said, "that the Chelford treasure is not yours or
  mine to divide? That it belongs to Lord Chelford, his heirs and his
  successors?"</p>

  <p>"It is treasure trove," she said startlingly. "I know the law of the
  country, because I've talked this thing over with Harry times without number.
  Treasure found hidden after hundreds of years has to be divided between the
  State and the finder."</p>

  <p>He shook his head with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Our Mary is a lawyer!" he bantered. "You're wrong, my dear. That is only
  the case if the owner of the money cannot be found. In the present instance
  there is no doubt whatever that the treasure would belong to Chelford."</p>

  <p>He saw her face fall and went on.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that that is going to inconvenience us seriously," he said,
  looking her straight in the eyes. "You cannot lose what you never had,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>She drew a deep sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"It is Harry's, I suppose, but after the way he has treated me, and all
  that I've done for him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," he said soothingly. "We needn't worry about Harry. The only
  question is, have you found the treasure?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"You've actually seen it?"</p>

  <p>"No," she hesitated, "I haven't seen it. I hadn't time. But I saw the
  boxes through the grating. The door was locked, and I was so excited that I
  had to come out and walk around. And then Dick Alford saw me."</p>

  <p>Arthur was puzzled. He knew this girl well enough; they had been good
  friends in the days when she was Chelford's secretary, and she had been a
  most useful agent of his.</p>

  <p>"Now let's get down to brass tacks," he said brusquely. "Where did you see
  this treasure and when?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you when. I saw it two days ago," she said, to his surprise,
  for he had thought she was talking about some experience she had had when she
  was an inmate of Fossaway Manor.</p>

  <p>"Two days ago?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"Two days ago," she affirmed. "And as to where, well, there's another
  matter to be settled before we get as far as that, Arthur. Will you sign that
  agreement?"</p>

  <p>He looked at the paper again. His training in the law, his natural
  instincts against putting his name under any document which bound him, urged
  him to temporise.</p>

  <p>"It is yes or no," she said, as though she read his mind. "I'm not going
  to fool around with you unless you mean business. I'll take it to Harry, and
  maybe, if I put him in possession of this gold, he'll do the right thing by
  me."</p>

  <p>And, seeing that he made no move, she took up the paper, folded it
  determinedly and put it in her little satchel.</p>

  <p>"What's the hurry?" he said, in alarm. "Mary, you're mad to expect me to
  take a big decision like this without giving the matter a moment's thought.
  Don't you realise what you're asking me to do? You're proposing an act of
  sheer robbery and you're asking me to become an accomplice. After all&mdash;"
  He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"If your conscience is hurting you," she said, "we'll leave it. I'm not
  the sort of girl who'd throw herself at any man's head. I'll take it along to
  Harry and see if his conscience is busy."</p>

  <p>She turned to go, but before she reached the door he had intercepted
  her.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly and don't be unreasonable." He was more than a little
  agitated. "It's a big thing you're asking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's a big thing I'm giving," she said impatiently. "Two million and a
  half pounds&mdash;there's nothing mean about that."</p>

  <p>He took her by the arm and forcibly drew her back. "Sit down and don't be
  a fool," he said. "I've told you already I'll marry you tomorrow, and I'll go
  farther and say that there never was a time when money was sweeter to me than
  it is at the moment."</p>

  <p>"Will you sign that note?"</p>

  <p>He skimmed it through quickly, making sure that he was under no obligation
  if the treasure did not materialise, and, picking up a pen, he made a little
  correction, she watching suspiciously, and signed with a flourish.</p>

  <p>"What is that you've put into the paper?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"An exit for Arthur Gine," he said with a whimsical smile. "The document
  reads, 'In consideration of receiving on behalf of my client, Lord Chelford,'
  etcetera, etcetera."</p>

  <p>At first she did not understand, and then a slow smile dawned on her
  face.</p>

  <p>"I see," she nodded. "That means that if anything comes out, you're acting
  for him and not for yourself. Arthur, there are times when I think you're
  clever!"</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine smiled as he put his arm about her and led her to the window.
  Below, thick streams of road traffic were passing east and west. A great
  lorry was under his eyes; he saw an inscription on its side, "5 tons." It
  would require three such lorries to move the Chelford treasure, he thought,
  and for a moment his head reeled.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you how clever I am when I handle the first bar of the Chelford
  treasure. And you'll know how clever you are when I've dealt with the last.
  There's two millions in this. Now tell me, where is this gold?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a second, and then, lowering her voice:</p>

  <p>"In the vaults of Chelford Abbey," she said.</p>

  <p>For a second neither spoke, and then: "Will you see your sister, Mr Gine?
  She has just arrived."</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine spun round, an oath on his lips. Gilder had come noiselessly
  into the room, his inscrutable eyes fixed upon his employer. Not a muscle of
  his face betrayed whether or not he had overheard the last words.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">LESLIE GINE'S occupations at Willow House were well defined.
  Though her brother did not maintain a very expensive or elaborate
  establishment, he lived in a style consonant with the position he held in the
  county. There were little dinner-parties, an occasional dance, and, in the
  winter, Arthur, who was a good man to hounds and was ambitious to be master
  of the local pack, entertained on a lavish scale the more prominent members
  of the Hunt. In these amenities Leslie acted as hostess for her brother, and
  at all times was the real housekeeper of the establishment. For all his
  extravagance he was a careful and grudging house-master, required that the
  necessities of life should be bought in the cheapest markets, that the best
  at the lowest price should be found upon his table.</p>

  <p>The resolve to go to town that morning had been born of a sudden impulse.
  The day was her own and she could do as she liked with it. For some reason
  the idea of lunching alone did not appeal to her. She had a wild thought of
  going on to Fossaway Manor, but remembered that Wednesday was a day that Dick
  Alford gave up entirely to visiting his tenant farmers. She did not attempt
  to explain to herself why the prospect of lunching tête-à-tête with her
  fiancé was even more distasteful than lunching alone. She had got beyond the
  point of finding excuses for herself; she felt a certain recklessness; was
  conscious that her manner and attitude of mind were defiant. Against what and
  whom?</p>

  <p>With a lift of her pretty shoulders she shrugged the matter out of
  consideration. All that she knew was that the preoccupation of Dick Alford
  and the unlikelihood of seeing him made a visit to Fossaway Manor not only
  undesirable but out of the question.</p>

  <p>She would go to town: the decision was taken in an instant, and she went
  upstairs and dressed hurriedly, whilst the gardener wheeled her little
  two-seater to the drive before the house. Five minutes later she was spinning
  along the straight road towards the railway station. She had plenty of time;
  indeed there was a certainty that she would arrive at the station at least
  half an hour before the train left, even if it was punctual.</p>

  <p>As she entered Fontwell Cutting she thought she saw a familiar form
  crossing the field towards the road a quarter of a mile away, and her heart
  jumped for no known reason. The high walls of the cut road shut out her view,
  but when she emerged and slid down the steep little hill to the village road,
  she discovered that she had not been mistaken, and brought her car to a halt
  as Dick Alford opened a field gate and came out.</p>

  <p>He greeted her with a wave of his hand and a smile, and, to her
  consternation, would have passed on had she not called him back.</p>

  <p>"You are very jumpy and cross this morning," she said, and to her surprise
  he admitted that fault, though she had seen nothing in his manner to deserve
  the challenge she had made.</p>

  <p>"I am very annoyed indeed. If there is one thing I don't want to see, it
  is our good farms turned into little residential estates for the City gentry!
  I sold Red Farm to Mr Leonard last week, under the impression that the
  old"&mdash;he checked a naughty word&mdash;"gentleman wanted to extend his
  holding, though why on earth he should want to buy Red Farm, which is the
  poorest land around here, I couldn't guess."</p>

  <p>"And what has he done?"</p>

  <p>Dick was indeed very much annoyed, she noticed now, and was secretly
  amused. She had a woman's satisfaction in seeing the man she liked thrown
  momentarily off his balance and revealing himself in a light that was new to
  her.</p>

  <p>"And what has the old&mdash;gentleman done?" she mocked him.</p>

  <p>"He has resold the farm to a wretched man in London&mdash;though the
  purchaser is not aware that such a sale is invalid without my signature."</p>

  <p>"A stranger?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes; though he has been living in the neighbourhood all summer. He has a
  cottage somewhere about here."</p>

  <p>"On the Ravensrill?" she asked, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"That is the fellow," he nodded. "I've never seen him, but I understood he
  was only staying here for a few months. And now I find that the beggar's
  bought Red Farm and intends putting up something in stucco with bow windows!
  And I daresay he will dig an artificial pond, start a rosery, and turn God's
  productive acres into a forcing house for sickly flowers!"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't he?" she asked coolly, and he stared at her. "After all,
  you said this was the poorest land round here, and if it cannot be useful it
  may as well be beautiful. I rather like artificial ponds and roseries."</p>

  <p>In spite of his annoyance he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Then probably you'll go to Mr Gilder's house-warming," he said.</p>

  <p>She started.</p>

  <p>"Who?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Mr Gilder. He's something in the City&mdash;probably a deuce of a swell
  in his own way, but I wish he'd gone somewhere else. And as to Leonard, I've
  already told him that I shall not go to his funeral."</p>

  <p>"Dick, you ought to be ashamed of yourself!" she said indignantly. "Poor
  old man!" Then, in a different voice: "You don't know his Christian
  name?"</p>

  <p>"Whose&mdash;Leonard's?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be stupid&mdash;Mr Gilder's."</p>

  <p>Dick frowned.</p>

  <p>"Fabrian," he said at last. "What a name! It sounds like a secret
  society!"</p>

  <p>She wondered if Arthur knew of this enterprise of his clerk: it was hardly
  likely that Mr Gilder would buy property in the neighbourhood without
  consulting his chief. For the moment she deemed it prudent to turn the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"If you were nice and kind and brotherly," she said, "you would come along
  with me to the station and garage my car like a nice man."</p>

  <p>He stood irresolutely, and for a moment she went hot at the implied
  rebuff. And then: "I'm wasting my master's time," he said, "but there are
  occasions when pleasure must interfere with duty, and this is one of them. Do
  you mind if I drive? I have no faith in women drivers."</p>

  <p>"You are very rude," she said, but nevertheless moved aside to let him
  take the wheel.</p>

  <p>"How is Harry this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Fine," he said sardonically. And then, heartily ashamed of himself:
  "Harry is trying a new patent medicine. You've never been in his bedroom?
  That is an indelicate question to ask, but have you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, the hint of laughter in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"There are about eight hundred and forty-five varieties of patent
  medicines in Harry's bedroom," he said grimly. "Once every three months we
  have a spring-clean and chuck 'em out! Really there isn't very much wrong
  with Harry, and if he did not read patent medicine advertisements he would be
  a happier man. Just now he's trying something for his nerves, and if there's
  anything left in the bottle at the end of the week I shall take it
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Poor Harry!" she said softly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm a brute to grouse," he said, almost gruffly, and seemed to imply
  in some subtle fashion that she was a provocative party to his brutality.</p>

  <p>It occurred to her as strange that he never spoke about the time when she
  would be mistress of Fossaway Manor. It would have been natural in him to
  say, "When you're married I hope you'll cure Harry of that nonsense," but he
  had made no such reference. That was the strange thing about Dick, that he
  never even suggested or hinted of a coming time when she would be Countess of
  Chelford. In one way she was glad he did not&mdash;especially now.</p>

  <p>They wound slowly through the leafy lanes, passed a little wood, all
  olive, russet and purple with the decay of autumn, and came to the station
  ten minutes ahead of time.</p>

  <p>"You have had no further visit from your Black Abbot?" she asked, as they
  strolled on to the station platform.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No; the police came last night to make inquiries. I don't suppose it will
  go much farther. You read about it in the newspaper, of course?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Servants talk," she said.</p>

  <p>"I really don't believe in this Black Abbot," he went on. "It is queer
  that Harry is scared of this spook. He never goes outside the house when the
  old Abbot is reported in the neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"You don't believe either?"</p>

  <p>He pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>"When I see a ghost I shall believe it. Until then I am politely
  sceptical."</p>

  <p>As the train drew out of the station she put her head out of the window
  and looked back. He was standing stock-still upon the platform where she had
  left him; and although she could not see his face, she felt that he was
  gazing after her, and thought she detected a certain tenseness in his very
  attitude&mdash;all of which was very pleasing to Miss Leslie Gine.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">STRANGE as it may seem, she had never visited her brother's
  office in High Holborn before she left her taxi at the door and came up in
  the elevator to his magnificent suite. Her appearance had a prosaic cause.
  She had left the country without a penny: a fact she did not realise till the
  ticket collector, working through the train, came into her compartment and
  aroused her from a daydream to the realisation that she had neither ticket
  nor money to pay for it. She gave the man her card, and a taxi brought her to
  Holborn.</p>

  <p>She was to have another novel experience. A tall, thickset man, with
  iron-grey hair and a strong, attractive face, had come into the waiting-room
  to meet her. She remembered him as the solitary fisherman who had sat fishing
  for hours on the bank of Ravensrill without, apparently, catching anything.
  So this was the redoubtable Mr Gilder of whom Arthur had so often spoken. She
  was not especially curious about him. He was a head clerk, and, by Arthur's
  account, a clever man at his work; but now that she saw him she was
  impressed. He was distinctive&mdash;outside of type. The average of humanity
  you may pass in the street without noticing. It would be impossible to have
  seen Fabrian Gilder once without recognising him instantly after the passage
  of years. The jaw was almost square, his big mouth was so tightly drawn that
  he seemed to be lipless; a powerful nose, a pair of penetrating grey eyes,
  under straggly, uneven eyebrows; this, and the breadth of his shoulders,
  conveyed an imponderable impression of power.</p>

  <p>"You are Miss Gine, of course?" he said. "I would have recognised your
  relationship with your brother even if I had not known your name."</p>

  <p>It was a little shock to Leslie that she in any way resembled Arthur, for
  Arthur's good looks were of a variety which she neither envied nor
  admired.</p>

  <p>"He is engaged at the moment. If you'll sit down I'll go along and tell
  him."</p>

  <p>His eyes did not leave her face. She had often seen in stories the word
  "devour" applied to an intensity of gaze, and she thought that fictional
  characters must look somehow as Mr Gilder was looking. He was not staring; it
  was the concentration, the probing investigation of those bright grey eyes,
  that made her writhe inside. If he had been impertinent it would have been an
  easy matter to have dealt with him, but he was respect itself. His attitude
  was deferential, his general manner was friendly. He was dressed very well
  and carefully, she thought, and wondered whether Arthur's preciosity in the
  matter of clothing influenced his staff. The grey homespun, the rather solid
  shoes, were set off by the expensiveness of his linen. With a woman's eye she
  saw that in his way this man was something of a dandy too.</p>

  <p>"I hear you are going to live near us, Mr Gilder?" she said, and he was
  obviously taken aback.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;yes," he said awkwardly. "I've bought a little place near your
  house. I love that part of the country."</p>

  <p>"We shall be neighbours," she said with a smile, but felt no pleasure in
  the prospect.</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;yes. I suppose we shall be, Miss Gine," he agreed.</p>

  <p>"It will be very nice for Arthur. I suppose it was his suggestion that you
  should come down?"</p>

  <p>He had a nervous little trick of stroking an invisible moustache, for he
  was clean-shaven.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;no," he said. "I haven't told Mr Gine yet that I have bought
  the property. I thought another time would be more opportune. I bought it for
  a song&mdash;thirty-five hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>She looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>"That is an expensive song," she said, before she realised an error of
  taste.</p>

  <p>This time he was visibly disconcerted.</p>

  <p>"Yes; I borrowed the money," he said.</p>

  <p>She had a feeling that he was going to ask her a favour, and guessed what
  the favour would be: Leslie had the uncanny gift of reading people's minds
  and gathering their surface thoughts, and in those moments when Fabrian
  Gilder dropped his mask he was rather easy. He opened his lips to speak,
  thought better of it, meeting perhaps the chill atmosphere of a refusal
  before it was given, and then: "I'll see if your brother is disengaged," he
  said, and went into the room to Arthur Gine, his head reeling with the vision
  which had emerged through the grey fog of his drab life.</p>

  <p>Day after day he had watched her, and she had never known. He had left his
  rod and line to steal behind trees that he might see her pass. She was
  romance in excelsis&mdash;the perfect realisation of thirty years of
  dreaming.</p>

  <p>It took him a second to compose himself before he turned the handle and
  walked in, and then he stood stricken dumb by the words that came to him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">"MY SISTER?" said Arthur quickly. He looked from Gilder to
  Mary Wenner. "Come and see me later," he said in a lower voice. "Gilder, show
  Miss Wenner out through the side door."</p>

  <p>Gilder opened the private door and followed the girl into the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>"Where are you living?" he asked.</p>

  <p>There was such a note of authority in his voice that for the moment the
  girl was taken off her guard.</p>

  <p>"37, Cranston Mansions. Why?" she asked, with a certain archness that
  indicated resentment but invited a further offence.</p>

  <p>"Because I want to see you," said Gilder. "May I come round to your flat
  some evening?"</p>

  <p>Miss Wenner was shocked a little at this. There were moments when her
  sense of propriety was easily outraged. She was curious too: so far from
  resenting his commanding address, she rather liked it.</p>

  <p>"Yes, any evening you wish, if you will let me know that you are coming. I
  will ask a young lady friend to keep me company."</p>

  <p>Gilder's hard lips curled.</p>

  <p>"Unless you particularly want a chaperone don't get one," he said. "I have
  much to say to you that I don't want anybody else to hear."</p>

  <p>He accompanied her to the elevator, and on the way extracted a promise to
  receive him alone. Miss Wenner was almost as curious to know the object of
  that visit as Mr Gilder was to discover what was behind the amazing statement
  he had heard. He passed the closed door of Arthur's room and heard voices. He
  would have given a lot for an excuse to interrupt brother and sister, but
  something told him that it would be wiser if he kept out of his employer's
  way until he was absolutely certain that the girl had not betrayed the very
  carefully hidden transaction which had made him the proprietor of Red
  Farm.</p>

  <p><br>
  "You're a little goose to come up to town without money," said Arthur, as he
  skinned three notes from his pocket-book. "Here is enough to keep you happy
  for the rest of your life."</p>

  <p>"Would fifteen pounds do that?" she laughed, and was going, when she
  remembered.</p>

  <p>Arthur listened in amazement to the news she had to give.</p>

  <p>"Gilder has bought a house at Chelfordbury? Impossible!" he said. "He
  would have told me. Why the dickens does he want a house?&mdash;besides, he
  has no money."</p>

  <p>"Hasn't he?" she asked, in surprise.</p>

  <p>Arthur scratched his chin irritably.</p>

  <p>"I suppose the beggar has; but a house at Chelfordbury&mdash;that is
  extraordinary! I wasn't even aware that he knew the place."</p>

  <p>"He is the man who has been staying at Ravensrill Cottage all the summer,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"The fisherman!" He whistled. "What a close bird he is! Of course," he
  went on quickly, "there is nothing wrong in a man wanting to live at
  Chelfordbury, and there's no reason in life why he shouldn't buy a house. But
  what a sly old fox!"</p>

  <p>He was troubled; she saw that he was trying to hide it behind a flippancy
  which was transparent to her.</p>

  <p>"I knew, of course, that somebody had rented the fisherman's cottage, as
  they call it, and to think that he's been down all these months and never
  once given himself away!"</p>

  <p>"He has a car, if he's the same man who was living at the cottage," she
  nodded. "Dick Alford is furious!"</p>

  <p>Arthur chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Dick!" he said good-humouredly. "He loathes this residential
  idea, and when I put forward a scheme to cut up one of his northern estates
  into residential properties, he nearly bit my head off. Harry would have done
  it like a shot, and I hope, my dear, when you're married you'll persuade
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He waited expectantly.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;when I am married," she said, and her tone made him glance at
  her keenly. But he was wise enough to skim over that subject.</p>

  <p>"Dick, of course, is a fool," he said, with good-natured contempt. "He has
  a blind faith in the future of agriculture in this country, and grudges every
  acre that's taken out of cultivation. And yet, if you were to put up a scheme
  to build huge blocks of cottages to relieve the slum congestion, or something
  equally quixotic and unprofitable, he would jump at the idea. I can well
  understand that the mere thought of a successful lawyer's clerk setting
  himself up as a country gentleman would make Dick foam at the mouth!"</p>

  <p>"He wasn't foaming when I left him," she said dryly.</p>

  <p>"When you left him?" He was quick to take a point.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he came down to   the station with me." And she could not account
  for her momentary feeling of embarrassment.</p>

  <p>He was still searching her face, and then, laying his hands on her
  shoulders, he shook her gently.</p>

  <p>"Old girl," he said, "keep your mind off the second son! He's a good-
  looking fellow, and side by side with his brother there's no question of
  choice! But he's a second son, which means that he's next door to being
  broke. And you can't live on good looks or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes slowly to his.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;I can't live on good looks?" she said
  deliberately. "Why do you emphasise the fact that Dick Alford is poor? Aren't
  I an heiress?"</p>

  <p>He did not speak, and then, with a little laugh, dropped his hands.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course, chick!" he said lightly. "Only&mdash;well, I want you to
  do something for yourself. Make a name in the country. It will be something
  to have the position which Harry can offer you. Dick is quite a good
  fellow&mdash;one of the best, although he doesn't get on very well with me.
  But there's nothing to it with him, Leslie. You might as well marry some
  poverty-stricken gentleman farmer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped under the steady gaze that met him.</p>

  <p>"'Poverty-stricken' again, Arthur. Without suggesting that I would rather
  marry Dick Alford, I wonder why the question of his poverty interests you so
  much. If you had called him a commoner and a nobody, I could have understood,
  but you insist upon the question of my possible fiancé's wealth, and that
  seems strange to me."</p>

  <p>He laughed long and loudly, but his merriment seemed, to her sensitive
  ear, lacking in sincerity.</p>

  <p>"You ought to be a lawyer, Leslie! Upon my word, I've a good mind to have
  you coached for an examination! You'd look simply topping in a wig and gown!
  And now, my little girl, you must run away, because I've a tremendous lot of
  work to do."</p>

  <p>He put his arm round her shoulders and walked with her to the door, and
  breathed a sigh of relief when he heard the whine of the elevator carrying
  her down. Closing the door behind him, he rang the bell, and, to the clerk
  who came:</p>

  <p>"Ask Mr Gilder to come in, will you, please?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Gilder had this message he knew that the girl had told
  her brother; and although he had his fair share of moral courage, it needed a
  conscious effort on his part to answer the summons.</p>

  <p>"Gilder, what is this story of you buying Red Farm?" asked Arthur
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"Why should I not buy Red Farm?" replied Gilder coolly.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason in the world why you shouldn't," said Arthur, after a
  moment's thought; "but it is rather curious you never told me."</p>

  <p>"I thought you might object," said Gilder. "Business men hate their
  workaday associates living anywhere near them. It was stupid of me not to
  tell you. I've been living in a cottage at Chelfordbury for three
  months&mdash;was that in itself objectionable? You will forgive me for saying
  so, but although I have always regarded you with the respect that is due to
  an employer, I have never quite looked upon you as my feudal lord!"</p>

  <p>Arthur grinned for a second.</p>

  <p>"Once or twice I thought of coming over to see you," Gilder went on, "but
  I've always had what I think to be a natural reluctance to intrude myself in
  a social capacity upon my chief. If you had ever invited me to come and stay
  a weekend at your place I would have come, and you would have known all about
  my presence in the neighbourhood. As it was, I felt very much in the position
  of a servant enjoying himself in his own independent way and feeling no need
  to consult his employer as to how he should employ his spare time&mdash;and
  money."</p>

  <p>"And money," repeated Arthur. "I didn't know you were so well off,
  Gilder?"</p>

  <p>Mr Gilder inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"I have already hinted to you that I have made considerable sums. There,
  again, it has never seemed necessary that I should keep you acquainted with
  my bank balance."</p>

  <p>"You have had a moderate salary," said Arthur significantly. "Not a
  generous amount, I agree; certainly not an amount from which a man could save
  a sum sufficient to buy and rebuild Red Farm and maintain it."</p>

  <p>For answer Gilder put his hand in his pocket and, taking out a little
  Russia-leather note-case, laid it on the table. The name in gold letters upon
  the cover was that of a bookmaker who carried one of his employer's biggest
  accounts. With this firm Arthur had lost his largest bets, for Trumans had
  offered him facilities which other houses had denied to him.</p>

  <p>"Truman?" He frowned. "What has that to do with it? Have you been backing
  horses?"</p>

  <p>Gilder shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said simply. "I am Truman."</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine gaped at him. Truman! The bookmaker to whom for weeks in
  succession he had been paying thousands upon thousands of pounds!</p>

  <p>"Then the money you have&mdash;is my money!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"Your money?" said the other quietly. "If Trumans had not taken it, some
  other bookmaker would have done so. When you won you were paid&mdash;have you
  any complaints?"</p>

  <p>"My money!" muttered Arthur.</p>

  <p>Gilder replaced the book in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"You remember five years ago complaining to me that you couldn't find
  bookmakers who would take big bets by telegram within a few minutes of the
  race? That little talk gave me an idea. I knew you lost steadily, that you
  were one of those&mdash;unfortunate people&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say 'fools'&mdash;that was the word on your lips."</p>

  <p>"'Mug' was the word," said Mr Gilder, with great calmness. "I knew you
  were one of those people who couldn't stop betting. So Trumans came into
  existence. Their book of rules was sent to you, featuring the important
  concession that you could wire big sums of money up to within a few minutes
  of a race. Do you know how much you've lost in the last five years?"</p>

  <p>Arthur was pale with fury, but, mastering himself, shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You have lost sixty-three thousand pounds to Truman alone," said the
  other slowly. "And I have won it!"</p>

  <p>The colour came and went in Arthur Gine's face. He knew all the time that
  his rage and resentment were unreasonable. Hitherto Truman had been a name on
  a telegraph form, an address somewhere in the West End to which his
  unprofitable telegrams were sent. Who they were he neither knew nor cared;
  they might have been people infinitely more objectionable than Gilder.</p>

  <p>But there was a suggestion of duplicity in the man's confession. Arthur
  Gine felt that be bad been tricked by a servant he trusted, and he was
  helpless in face of sixty-three thousand facts, all of which balanced on the
  side of the hard-faced man before him.</p>

  <p>"You are not Rathburn &amp; Co., I suppose?" he asked, mentioning another
  bookmaking firm that had drawn heavily upon his resources.</p>

  <p>To his amazement, Gilder nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am Rathburn &amp; Company. I am also Burton &amp; Smith. I am, in fact,
  the three bookmakers to whom you have been losing money at the rate of thirty
  thousand a year for the past five years. There is no sense in looking like
  that, Gine. I have been guilty of no crime. On the few occasions when you
  have won money, you have been paid. Your losses would not have been so
  distasteful if they had been made to an unknown man. I took the risk&mdash;my
  luck against yours. When I started, I staked my little fortune&mdash;three
  thousand pounds, won through the years by scrimping and saving. If you had
  been lucky, I should have been ruined."</p>

  <p>"Instead of which you were lucky&mdash;and I am ruined," said Arthur Gine
  huskily. He was shaken from his accustomed calm. "You are quite right, though
  it is a little&mdash;bewildering."</p>

  <p>He looked curiously at the inscrutable face of his managing clerk,
  striving to readjust his estimate of a man whom he had looked upon as little
  more than a superior servant. Then the humour of the position struck him and
  he laughed.</p>

  <p>"If I'm not careful I shall be sorry for myself, and I should hate that,
  Gilder! So you're a rich man, eh? What are you going to do with your
  money?"</p>

  <p>Gilder's eyes did not leave his face.</p>

  <p>"I am going to settle down in the country," he said, "and I am going to
  marry."</p>

  <p>"Splendid!" There was a note of irony in Arthur Gine's tone. "And who is
  the fortunate lady?"</p>

  <p>It was a long time before the other replied. He stared open-eyed at his
  sometime master, and then, very deliberately and slowly: "It is my desire and
  intention to marry Miss Leslie Gine," he said.</p>

  <p>Not a muscle of Arthur Gine's face moved; his colour did not change. But
  into his eyes came a glare which was malign and devilish. For a second the
  imperturbable Gilder was scared. Had he gone too far? Both men were learning
  something that day. Gilder had a momentary view of something that was very
  ugly and menacing, and then the curtains were drawn and the inner self of
  Arthur Gine vanished in an enigmatic smile.</p>

  <p>"That is very interesting and very&mdash;enterprising of you, Gilder!
  Unfortunately, I have other plans."</p>

  <p>He rose leisurely from his chair, walked round the desk and confronted the
  other, his hands thrust into his pockets.</p>

  <p>"What are you prepared to pay for the privilege of being my brother-in-
  law?" he bantered.</p>

  <p>Fabrian Gilder took up the challenge.</p>

  <p>"The return of half your betting losses for the past five years," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Arthur shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not enough," he smiled.</p>

  <p>"The cancellation of four bills," said Gilder deliberately, "drawn and
  accepted by Lord Chelford, the acceptance in each case being forged by
  you."</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine staggered back to his desk, his face white and drawn, and
  Gilder pursued the advantage.</p>

  <p>"You didn't think it was an accident that I suggested you should get
  Chelford to back a bill for you, did you? Seventy-five thousand pounds isn't
  enough for you, eh? I'll give you this alternative: five years in
  Dartmoor!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">LESLIE had spent rather a boring afternoon, and not once but
  many times she regretted that she had promised to return to Arthur's office.
  He was driving her down to Willow House, and but for this arrangement she
  would have returned to Chelfordbury by an early train, for her shopping did
  not occupy more than an hour.</p>

  <p>She rang up her brother to suggest this plan, never doubting that he would
  agree, but, to her surprise: "I think you'd better return with me, girl. Come
  along to the office about half past four instead of five. By the way, Gilder
  wants us to go home to his flat to tea. You don't mind, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Mr Gilder?" she said, in surprise, and he went on hastily:</p>

  <p>"We ought to be civil to him. He's going to be a neighbour of ours, and
  he&mdash;he's not a bad sort of fellow."</p>

  <p>Her inclination was to plead a headache and be excused an experience
  which, to state the matter mildly, was not wholly to her taste. But Arthur
  seldom asked a favour of her, and it was apparent from his tone that he was
  anxious she should show this act of civility to his head clerk; somewhat
  unwillingly she agreed.</p>

  <p>If he detected her reluctance he made no comment upon it and seemed in a
  hurry to ring off. There was no reason in the world why the projected call
  should make her uneasy, and yet, for some obscure reason, this coming
  experience hung like a cloud over her for the rest of the afternoon. This
  time, when she returned to the office, she entered by Arthur's private door.
  He was alone, sitting at his desk in a familiar attitude, his head between
  his hands, his gloomy eyes fixed upon the blotting-pad. She thought his face
  had less colour than usual; and in his eyes there was a haggard, hunted
  expression which was startling. He forced a smile to greet her, but she was
  not deceived.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you well, Arthur?" she asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Fit as a fiddle," he laughed; "only I have had a pretty heavy day. I
  suppose I look a little washed out."</p>

  <p>He did not seem very anxious to discuss himself, but plunged straight into
  the subject of the surprising call they were to make.</p>

  <p>"Gilder has a flat off Regent's Park," he said. "Be as nice to him as you
  can, Leslie. He's been a pretty useful man. By the way," he said awkwardly,
  "he is a bachelor."</p>

  <p>She smiled at this; in her wildest dreams she would not have imagined that
  this statement had any particular interest for herself.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea he was such a&mdash;that he was so prosperous," she said.
  "No, I don't mean that bachelorhood is a sign of poverty, but his estate at
  Chelfordbury, and his flat in Regent's Park, are not exactly what one would
  have expected."</p>

  <p>"He isn't a bad fellow," repeated Arthur, as he rang the bell. "I think
  you'll like him: he is rather&mdash;amusing."</p>

  <p>"Amusing" was not the word he would have used in all truth, but it was the
  only word he could think of at the moment. As though he were waiting for this
  summons, Mr Gilder came in answer to the bell. He carried a light coat over
  his arm and a spotless grey felt hat in his hand. Again Leslie was
  uncomfortably conscious of the man's scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"You know Mr Gilder, Leslie?"</p>

  <p>His uneasiness and apprehension were communicating themselves to her. Try
  as she did, she could not succeed in shaking off her sensation of
  disquietude. The atmosphere was electric; she would have been dull indeed if
  she had not responded to the strain.</p>

  <p>Throughout the journey Mr Gilder talked almost without interruption. He
  had a deep but pleasant voice, and was an easy conversationalist. Arthur was
  beginning to know something about the man with whom he had worked side by
  side all these years, and to regard him in a new light. Hitherto Gilder had
  been a cipher&mdash;a familiar figure that had appeared from heaven knew
  where in the morning and had disappeared at the end of a day's work into the
  blue. As though unconscious of his employer's wonder and speculation, Gilder
  chatted on.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, Leslie catalogued the subjects which were discussed so
  one-sidedly during that drive. He talked of aviation, of wireless, of books he
  had read&mdash;Dumas was his favourite&mdash;of the war, of Russia, of
  Italy's renaissance, of American writers, of the weather, polo&mdash;of
  almost every subject that occupied public attention. She knew that he was
  trying to impress her, and saw in this no more than the natural desire of a
  man to look well in the eyes of a woman.</p>

  <p>The flat was bigger than she had expected, and was one of many in the most
  exclusive apartment house on the Outer Circle. Arthur viewed its expensive
  appointments with a glum face. One black week of his at Ascot must have
  furnished three such flats as this, he thought, and the little devil of
  resentment and loathing grew stronger in his heart.</p>

  <p>Tea was served by two trimly uniformed maids, and Mr Gilder acted the part
  of host to perfection. He had a library of rare old books which she must see,
  and he took them to a room the walls of which were fitted with bookshelves
  and reminded Leslie, though there was no resemblance between the two
  apartments, of the hall wherein her fiancé spent most of his time.</p>

  <p>Gilder was showing the girl a rare first edition when a surprising thing
  happened.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I run out for five minutes, Leslie? I want to see a fellow
  who lives on the other side of the Park."</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine's voice was husky, his assumption of ease a miserable failure.
  The girl looked at him in astonishment, and then examined the face of the
  little watch on her wrist.</p>

  <p>"If you want to be back at Willow House in time for dinner&mdash;" she
  began.</p>

  <p>"I shan't be gone more than a quarter of an hour," he said desperately.
  "If you don't mind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Before she could utter a word he had vanished. It was all so unexpected,
  so strange, that she could not quite realise what had happened, and the last
  thought in the world she could have had, was that Arthur was deliberately
  leaving her alone with this grey man.</p>

  <p>On one point her mind was made up: she did not like Mr Gilder, and was
  fairly certain that her antipathy was shared by her brother. His strange
  manner in the presence of the man, his awkwardness, and, most convincing
  proof of all, his silence, puzzled her. Arthur was intensely selfish, would
  not go a step out of his way either for courtesy's sake or to save the
  feelings of those whom he regarded as his dependents. And this sudden desire
  to oblige his head clerk was contradictory to her knowledge of him. Yet she
  felt neither alarm nor annoyance, finding herself in that little library
  alone with this square-jawed clerk.</p>

  <p>As the door closed upon her brother, Fabrian Gilder carefully replaced on
  the shelf the book he had been examining.</p>

  <p>"I shall be in my new home by the spring," he said, "and I hope I shall
  see more of you, Miss Gine."</p>

  <p>She made a conventionally polite reply.</p>

  <p>"My ambition has always been to settle in the country and to follow my two
  hobbies, which are fishing and reading," he went on. "Happily, I am in the
  position of being able to retire from my profession&mdash;your brother has
  probably told you that I am a fairly wealthy man."</p>

  <p>Something in his tone focussed her attention. Her heart beat a little
  faster, and for the first time she was conscious of being alone with him.</p>

  <p>"I am not an old man&mdash;fifty I regard as the prime of life&mdash;and I
  think I have the capacity for making any woman happy."</p>

  <p>She met his eyes steadily.</p>

  <p>"I hope we shall have the pleasure of meeting your wife," she said.</p>

  <p>He made no reply to this, and she grew hot and cold under the scrutiny of
  those merciless grey eyes. And then, before she realised what was happening,
  his two big hands had closed about her arms and he was holding her away from
  him, peering into her face.</p>

  <p>"There is one woman in the world for me," he said, and his voice was husky
  with emotion; "one face that fills my eyes day and night! Leslie, all these
  months you have not been out of my sight or mind!"</p>

  <p>"Let me go!" she cried, struggling to free herself.</p>

  <p>"I want you! I've worked for you, I've schemed for you! Leslie, I love you
  as you will never be loved again! I want you&mdash;I want you!"</p>

  <p>He was drawing her nearer and nearer, his eyes like coals of fire;
  fascinating her to a queer listlessness that was almost quiescence. She found
  no reserve to combat him, and could only stare helplessly at the hard
  face.</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. He pushed her aside, his face convulsed
  with rage.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" he asked harshly, and the voice of the maid replied:</p>

  <p>"Mr Richard Alford to see you, sir!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">DICK ALFORD, waiting in the pretty drawing-room and
  wondering exactly how he should introduce what promised to be a very
  unpleasant discussion, saw the door flung open and a white-faced girl run
  in.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dick, Dick!" she sobbed.</p>

  <p>In a moment she was in his arms, her face against his breast.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, what has happened? How did you come here?" he asked,
  bewildered.</p>

  <p>Before she could reply, the big figure of Fabrian Gilder filled the
  doorway. The man did not speak, but the smouldering rage in his eyes was
  eloquent.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you want?" he boomed.</p>

  <p>Dick put the girl gently from him.</p>

  <p>"Why are you here, Leslie?"</p>

  <p>"Arthur brought me," she gasped. "I'm awfully sorry to make such a fool of
  myself, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dick looked from the girl to the man in the doorway and began dimly to
  understand.</p>

  <p>"Arthur brought you here?" he said slowly. "And left you alone&mdash;with
  this man?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Is he a friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I only met him today."</p>

  <p>Gradually the explanation of her distress was beginning to dawn upon him,
  and a cold rage filled his heart. An unfortunate moment for Arthur Gine to
  return. Dick heard the tinkle of a bell, quick footsteps in the hall, and saw
  the white face of the lawyer, made hideous by the smile he forced.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, old girl! What's the trouble?" he asked.</p>

  <p>He did not look at his host, Dick noticed with gathering fury.</p>

  <p>"I think you had better take Leslie home," he said. "I have a little
  business to do with Mr Gilder."</p>

  <p>Gilder had recovered something of his command of himself and his feelings;
  the situation, awkward as it was, had brought him violently into the circle
  about which so far he had revolved. It were better to be considered as an
  undesirable suitor than to be denied consideration as a factor at all in
  Leslie Gine's life.</p>

  <p>"May I ask by what right you dispose of my guests?" he demanded, but Dick
  took no notice of him.</p>

  <p>"Look after your sister, Gine," he said, and there was a scarcely veiled
  menace in the words. "I will give myself the pleasure of calling on you this
  evening."</p>

  <p>He took the girl's hand in his; she was still white and shaking, but
  smiled into his face.</p>

  <p>"I've made myself rather ridiculous, haven't I?" she said, in a low tone
  that only he could hear. "Dicky&mdash;perhaps I'm getting a little jumpy, and
  I may have taken offence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He patted her hand gently and walked with her past Gilder into the hall,
  Arthur following. It was Dick who opened the door, and stood patiently until
  they had gone, then he turned to face the enraged owner of the flat.</p>

  <p>"I had some real business to do with you, Gilder, but that can wait. First
  of all, I would like to ask, what have you said to Miss Gine?"</p>

  <p>"That is entirely my business," said Gilder. His gaze was steady; again he
  was completely master of himself, if not of the situation.</p>

  <p>"My business also," said Dick, without heat. "You are aware that Miss Gine
  is engaged to my brother?"</p>

  <p>Gilder licked his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't really interest me," he said. And then, after a second's
  thought: "I'm going to be frank with you, Alford&mdash;we may as well clear
  the air. I have asked Miss Gine to be my wife."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed?" said Dick softly. "And what had Miss Gine to say to
  that?"</p>

  <p>"You didn't give her an opportunity of replying," said the other, "but I
  rather think that there will be no difficulty in the matter."</p>

  <p>Dick did not conceal his smile. A shrewd judge of men, he had rightly
  understood the situation when he had seen Arthur's face on his return to the
  flat.</p>

  <p>"You mean there will be no difficulty so far as Mr Gine is concerned? I
  admit you have an historical precedent. You are not the first lawyer who
  wished to marry into his master's family."</p>

  <p>If Dick had not been angry he would not have said this; immediately the
  words were out he was sorry. But Gilder took up the point quickly.</p>

  <p>"I am not an Uriah Heep," he said, with a grim smile. "I am neither humble
  nor lowly."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, but really I don't think that matters very much, Gilder.
  Whatever Mr Gine's attitude may be, there will be a considerable difficulty
  in respect to Miss Gine&mdash;and to me."</p>

  <p>"To you?" Gilder's eyebrows went up and his lips curled. "Are you the
  lady's&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not engaged to Miss Gine, but my brother is," said Dick evenly. "But
  that is not the point. I am a friend of Leslie Gine's, and even if she
  changed her mind about marrying into my family, that would not affect the
  issue."</p>

  <p>Gilder was about to speak, but Dick went on: "I don't know what pull you
  have with Gine, or what dire threats you are holding over his head."</p>

  <p>He saw the man start, and laughed.</p>

  <p>"That went very near the mark?" he said. "But whatever influence you have,
  Gilder, you are not going to marry Leslie Gine."</p>

  <p>Gilder's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Is that a threat?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You can take it as a threat or as a pleasant compliment, or any old way
  you choose," said Dick, with that impish smile of his. "And now, if you don't
  mind, we'll come to business. You've bought a property of ours&mdash;Red
  Farm. You've paid thirty-five hundred pounds to Leonard. I have come to ask
  you to call off your bargain and to take five hundred profit."</p>

  <p>"In other words, you want to buy it back, eh? Well, there's nothing
  doing!" said Gilder harshly. "I intend living at Red Farm, and there isn't a
  law in the land that can stop me. You may not like my presence, but that is
  neither here nor there. I am not living at Chelfordbury for the pleasure of
  seeing you every day of my life."</p>

  <p>Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"I wondered why you wanted to live there at all, but now I think I
  understand," he said. "The offer I have made to you is without prejudice to
  any action I may take. Unfortunately for you, Leonard has no power to
  retransfer the property without my brother's consent&mdash;which means my
  consent, for I hold his power of attorney. Leonard may hold the property, but
  you cannot. You're a lawyer and it is not necessary for me to explain the
  intricacies of a copyhold lease, and that was all Leonard was buying. If you
  decide to fight the case, I'll take you into court, and you know that I shall
  get a verdict against you. I am offering you a chance of settling the matter
  amicably."</p>

  <p>"Which I refuse," said the other promptly.</p>

  <p>Dick inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"Very good. You will probably, on considering the matter in a calmer
  atmosphere, take a different view."</p>

  <p>He walked from the room, swinging his hat. In the doorway he turned.</p>

  <p>"As for Miss Leslie Gine, you will be well advised to reconsider that
  question also."</p>

  <p>"And suppose I don't?"</p>

  <p>Again that unfathomable smile.</p>

  <p>"You are going to be sorry," said Dick cryptically.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">NOT a word did Leslie say about her interview with Gilder,
  and her brother seemed just as anxious to avoid the topic as she. They drove
  down from town, and all the time he kept up a ceaseless flow of talk about
  affairs which he thought might interest her. He was nervous, and once, when
  she woke him from a reverie with a question, he started and turned red.</p>

  <p>"Sorry!" he stammered. "I was thinking of something."</p>

  <p>"And something unpleasant, Arthur," she said gently.</p>

  <p>He was staring straight ahead of him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, something damnably unpleasant!"</p>

  <p>They were nearing Chelfordbury now, and she put the question that had
  trembled on her lips throughout that long journey.</p>

  <p>"Arthur, do you know what Mr Gilder asked me?" And, when he did not reply:
  "He proposed to me," she said.</p>

  <p>Still he avoided her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Did he?" he asked awkwardly. "Well, that's an extraordinary thing for him
  to do!"</p>

  <p>"Arthur, did you know he was going to propose to me when you left us
  alone?"</p>

  <p>"He isn't a bad fellow," said Arthur Gine lamely. "Of course the idea is
  preposterous. But, after all, it is no sin for a fellow to fall in love with
  a girl and want to marry her&mdash;I mean, one can see his point of
  view."</p>

  <p>Leslie was a little shocked; she was more than a little angry. But she
  kept a tight rein on her tongue.</p>

  <p>"But, Arthur, you wouldn't agree to that? You know I am engaged to Harry.
  Why, you told me that it was the dream of your life to see me wearing a
  coronet! Not that I want to wear the beastly thing, but that was what you
  said."</p>

  <p>Ordinarily, Arthur Gine was possessed of a ready tongue and a nimble wit.
  He had lied his way out of many an embarrassing situation with more
  worldly-wise people than Leslie. But, somehow, in her presence his brain
  refused to function, and his witticisms were banal and vulgar even to
  himself.</p>

  <p>"My dear little girl," he said, with an attempt at cheerfulness, "it
  really doesn't matter to me whom you marry so long as you're happy. Gilder is
  a very solid man; he has a considerable private fortune."</p>

  <p>This time she swung round on her seat and faced him.</p>

  <p>"Arthur, why do you insist upon the fortune? Where is my money?"</p>

  <p>The question came point-blank and was not to be fenced with. He roused
  himself to meet a situation which had never before arisen.</p>

  <p>"Your money? Why, invested, of course!"</p>

  <p>He tried very hard, but he could not produce that convincing note which
  was so necessary.</p>

  <p>"Your fortune is in all sorts of shares and bonds. What a queer question
  to ask me, girlie!"</p>

  <p>"How much money have I?" she demanded ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>"About a quarter of a million&mdash;a little more or a little less. For
  goodness' sake don't talk about money, my dear."</p>

  <p>"But I will talk about it," she said. "Arthur, have I any at all?"</p>

  <p>His laughter did not carry conviction. And usually people accepted his
  word. Harry Chelford had asked him only a week before in what stocks his late
  mother's fortune was invested. And Arthur had replied glibly enough. It was
  the Miriam Chelford Trust that had occupied his mind through the journey.
  Something must be done there. Dick Alford had started to ask questions, and
  Dick had a memory like a recording machine. As for Leslie and her tiresome
  questions: "What a silly kid you are! Of course you've got money! I wish to
  heaven I had half your wad! You're a very rich little girl, and you ought to
  be a very happy little girl."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I have a penny," she said, and his heart sank.</p>

  <p>With a tremendous effort of will he met her questioning eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;in a way I hope I'm poor. I know I had money left me,
  because you showed me the will a long time ago. But you've been handling it,
  Arthur, and I've an idea that things haven't been going too well with
  you."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean I've stolen your fortune?" he asked loudly, and she
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't accuse you of that. I think it is possible you may have
  invested my fortune&mdash;unwisely! And it is quite possible that that
  quarter of a million has dwindled and dwindled until it has disappeared. Is
  that so?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?"</p>

  <p>"I wish to God you wouldn't ask such stupid questions," he said irritably.
  "Of course it isn't so!"</p>

  <p>For one wild moment he had the impulse to tell her the truth; but vanity,
  a shrinking from the possible effect the news would have upon the one person
  in the world for whom he had a grain of affection, inhibited the
  confession.</p>

  <p>Back he came naturally to the one thought present in his mind as he
  chattered and as he brooded. His last hope lay in the discovery of the
  Chelford treasure. If that were found, he could snap his fingers at Gilder,
  could restore the wasted fortune of his sister, and establish himself beyond
  assail. Gilder would never dare bring his story of the four bills to a court
  of law, and if he did, backed by the Chelford fortune Arthur could face the
  storm, confident that, if he made restitution to the man he had robbed, no
  evil consequences would follow. He was grasping at a straw, and knew it. But
  Mary Wenner was a shrewd little devil, not the kind of girl who, for the sake
  of making a sensation, would come to him with a cock-and-bull story. She
  might have been mistaken; on the other hand, she was so brimful of confidence
  that he could not believe the story was altogether without foundation.</p>

  <p>The road to Willow House skirted the grounds of Fossaway Manor, and he saw
  the crumbling arch, red in the setting sun, standing like a fiery question
  mark that attuned with his mood of doubt and hope.</p>

  <p>Arrived at his home, he went up to his room to bath and change before
  dinner, and it was with a positive sense of freedom that he found himself
  alone. He was a fool not to have told her the truth, he thought. After dinner
  he would get her in a softer mood, and make a clean breast of it. And then,
  at the tail of this decision, came the recollection of his interview with
  Mary Wenner. Suppose she had told the truth? Suppose he found these millions
  of pounds that had lain for centuries in the ground? He formed yet another
  plan.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">TO his unspeakable relief, Leslie was in her most cheerful
  mood throughout dinner, and the thought of Fabrian Gilder seemed to have been
  effectively banished.</p>

  <p>"Leslie," he asked, after the coffee had been served, "I want you to do me
  a great favour."</p>

  <p>She looked at him across the table, doubt in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember Mary Wenner, who used to be Harry's secretary?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Dick doesn't like her very much; he was telling me the other
  day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind what Dick likes or dislikes," he said testily. "Great heavens!
  are our lives to be run according to his fancies? I'm very sorry," he
  apologised with a laugh, "but you'll have to forgive me&mdash;I'm rather
  nervy tonight."</p>

  <p>"What about Mary Wenner?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I was wondering whether you would like to ask her down here to stay a
  weekend? I shall have a lot of work to do, and she's a very excellent
  stenographer. But I'll be perfectly frank with you, and tell you that that is
  not the only reason I'd like you to invite her. She's been in some kind of
  scrape and I want to help her through."</p>

  <p>Leslie Gine was not curious, or she might have questioned him more about
  this mythical trouble.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why she shouldn't come," she said. "If you'll give me her
  address I will write to her. I rather fancy that Dick's main objection to her
  is that she had some sort of attachment for Harry."</p>

  <p>"She's almost forgotten Harry," smiled her brother. "To be perfectly
  candid, I like the girl. She's not a lady, of course, but 'lady' nowadays is
  a vague and meaningless term. And there was really nothing in her affair with
  Harry. I mean it was not serious."</p>

  <p>"I've never thought so," said the girl, and thereupon the question of Mary
  Wenner was dismissed.</p>

  <p>He had, he said, some work to do that night, and left her alone in the
  drawing-room, and for once she did not find time hanging very heavily upon
  her hands. Ordinarily the prospect of an evening spent alone would have
  seemed intolerably dull, but she had so much to think about, so many
  perspectives to adjust, that she rather welcomed her solitude.</p>

  <p>Even at so short a distance of time, her experience with Fabrian Gilder
  seemed grotesquely unreal. Perhaps she was still numb from the shock of it,
  for, going over that unpleasant feature incident by incident, she could be
  neither angry nor amused. Perhaps she was a little afraid&mdash;she still
  felt the pressure of his strong hands upon her, still saw the grey fires that
  burnt in his eyes. And Dick! how natural it had been to go to him&mdash;how
  safe she had felt! Would it have been the same if Harry Chelford had
  providentially arrived? She was sure in her mind that she would not have run
  to Harry, or found comfort in his encircling arms.</p>

  <p>She looked at the clock; it was ten minutes past nine. Dick would be back
  at Fossaway Manor by now, and she went out into the hall and, taking off the
  receiver of the telephone, gave a number.</p>

  <p>Arthur's study door opened into the hall, and he came out.</p>

  <p>"To whom are you telephoning?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I'm calling up Fossaway Manor," she said.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to invite Dick Alford over, are you?" he demanded
  resentfully.</p>

  <p>Before she could reply, he heard the ring of a bell in the servants'
  quarters and she ran to the door. Through the glass panel she saw the gleam
  of a white shirt-front on the unlighted porch, and switched on the lights. It
  was Dick, and, with an oath, Arthur Gine flung back into his room and slammed
  the door. He had hoped that Dick had forgotten his threat to call that
  night.</p>

  <p>"Enter Richard of Chelford!" said the girl dramatically, as she threw open
  the door. "I was just phoning to you. I'm bored to extinction and I want
  amusing."</p>

  <p>Which was not true.</p>

  <p>"I don't feel at all amusing," said Dick, as he closed the door and hung
  up his cap on the hat-rack.</p>

  <p>She took him by the arm and led him into the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Arthur is invisible tonight; he is working very hard. He doesn't approve
  of you, and you hardly approve of him, so we shan't be interrupted. Dick, it
  was lovely of you to arrive as you did this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Gilder proposed to you, I understand?" said Dick quietly.</p>

  <p>"Did he tell you?" She fetched a long sigh. "Yes; I was amazed. I suppose
  it was very complimentary, but why did he do it in such a great hurry, do you
  think?"</p>

  <p>Dick took a cigarette from the box she offered him and lit it before he
  replied.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I've come to discover," he said. "I feel rather like
  a grand inquisitor, but I must know."</p>

  <p>"And I can't tell you."</p>

  <p>She was acting. He knew that her one object was to turn him from an
  interview with her brother, and she in turn knew that her efforts would be in
  vain.</p>

  <p>"You had no hint of this precious proposal in advance? Arthur told you
  nothing?"</p>

  <p>"No; Arthur couldn't possibly have known. He told me that Mr Gilder wanted
  us to see his new flat, and although it was a great bore going out to tea
  with somebody one doesn't know, I went&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To oblige Arthur, of course?"</p>

  <p>"No," she insisted; "you must credit me with a reasonable amount of
  feminine curiosity. Bachelors' establishments intrigue me. Your one drawback,
  from my point of view, is that you've only a poky little office and, I
  presume, a wretched little servant's bedroom."</p>

  <p>"For a second son I'm rather well off," said Dick with a quizzical smile.
  "You are sure Arthur didn't give you any forewarning of this proposal?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely sure. He was as much astonished as I was."</p>

  <p>"Have you discussed it with him?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I spoke about it in the car on the way down, and Arthur was
  rather&mdash;astonished."</p>

  <p>"Only astonished&mdash;not furious?"</p>

  <p>"He may have been furious too. Arthur doesn't carry his heart on his
  sleeve."</p>

  <p>"I should imagine not," said Dick dryly, and then: "Will you ask him if I
  can see him for five minutes?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him with troubled eyes.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to quarrel, are you, Dick?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm going to ask him a question or two. You realise that I'm entitled
  to know."</p>

  <p>"Why are you 'entitled'?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you think I am?" he asked gently.</p>

  <p>Her eyes went up to his for a second, and then dropped, as she read
  something there that thrilled and hurt her. Without a word she went out into
  the hall and knocked at Arthur's door.</p>

  <p>"What does he want? I can't be bothered tonight," said Arthur Gine
  fretfully. "What a fellow he is for interrupting people when they're
  busy!"</p>

  <p>"I think you'd better see him, Arthur," she said, and added: "And get it
  over."</p>

  <p>He shot a quick glance at her.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;get what over?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Whatever there is to get over," said Leslie quietly.</p>

  <p>Arthur looked down at the picturesque confusion of papers that covered his
  library table.</p>

  <p>"All right, shoot him in," he said ungraciously.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">HE did not attempt to rise from his chair when Dick entered,
  closing the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, will you, Alford? Leslie tells me you want to see me."</p>

  <p>"Leslie need not have given you that message. I'd already told you this
  afternoon that I would come to you for an explanation."</p>

  <p>"Of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of the unpleasant happening at Gilder's flat. This man proposed to your
  sister&mdash;you know that?"</p>

  <p>"Leslie told me," said the other, after a moment's silence.</p>

  <p>"And you were annoyed, one supposes? You will dismiss this clerk of yours
  tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>The other leaned back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why I should," he said coolly. "After all, it's no crime for
  any man to propose to a pretty girl. Of course he's not the sort of fellow I
  should choose for a brother-in-law, but if brothers had to choose husbands
  for their sisters, you know, Alford, there would be some very queer
  marriages!"</p>

  <p>"What is his pull?" asked Dick quietly.</p>

  <p>"I don't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is his hold on you?"</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Just what I say. You would never tolerate a man like Gilder paying
  attentions to your sister, apart from the insult he offered to a prospective
  Countess of Chelford, unless he had such a grip on you that all your natural
  indignation was crushed by the fear of some consequence he held over your
  head."</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine found it difficult to control his voice.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, how very melodramatic!" he scoffed. "'Hold over me!' You
  must have been studying the latest Drury Lane play! Naturally I would rather
  see Leslie married to your brother, but I certainly would put no obstacle in
  her way if her heart was set elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"On Gilder, in fact?"</p>

  <p>"On Gilder," nodded Arthur gravely, as though the matter had been the
  subject of deep thought and much self-communion.</p>

  <p>And then Dick Alford asked a question that brought the man to his feet,
  white and shaking.</p>

  <p>"Is it the question of the bills?"</p>

  <p>"The&mdash;the what?" faltered the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"The four bills which were supposed to be backed by my brother&mdash;the
  signatures being forgeries. I thought you knew that I had seen them. They
  were shown to me at the bank, and fortunately I did not disclaim
  them&mdash;fortunately for you, I mean. When I went to see them again they
  were taken up. I presume Mr Fabrian Gilder redeemed them. That would have
  cost him a little over five thousand pounds, and I presume he did not do
  that out of sheer altruism."</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine's mouth was dry; he could scarcely articulate.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know until today," he muttered. "Harry was ill at the time. The
  money was due to me for&mdash;for&mdash;legal costs. I went down to the bank
  to take them up and found they had been honoured."</p>

  <p>"Was that the pull?"</p>

  <p>He did not meet the steady gaze that was fixed on him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was the pull, if you want to know. You don't suppose I'd allow
  Leslie to marry a swine like Gilder unless&mdash;unless he had something on
  me, do you? Can't you understand my position, Alford? I'm ruined! That fellow
  could send me to gaol&mdash;he still can."</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Fire him tomorrow," he said. "If he produces the bills I will undertake
  that Harry will acknowledge the signatures."</p>

  <p>The pink came back to the colourless face of the lawyer. "You'll do this?"
  he said eagerly. "My God! you don't know what a weight you've lifted off my
  mind. You're a brick, by Jove! I'll fire him tomorrow."</p>

  <p>He held out an eager hand, and Dick took it with some hesitation. At the
  best of times Arthur Gine did not impress him; at this moment, almost
  incoherent with relief, he seemed a pitiful coward.</p>

  <p>"I will pay Harry every penny. I have something on the stocks now that
  will bring me in a fortune, that will wipe out all my debts and put me on my
  feet again."</p>

  <p>There was humour in the situation; for the thing which was to rehabilitate
  his fortunes was no less than the barefaced robbery of Harry Chelford's
  inheritance! But Arthur was not conscious of the irony of the position. He
  would deal with Gilder in the morning. Thank God he had not gone still deeper
  into the mire! The knowledge that in his pocket-book was another bill as yet
  unuttered did not cool the glow of virtue he was experiencing. Henceforth he
  would walk the straight way.</p>

  <p>"There's one thing you could do for me, Alford&mdash;hurry along that
  marriage. Fix it for next month if you can. Leslie is just a foolish girl,
  she is trying to put off the inevitable, but that's natural, isn't it? Can't
  you buck up Harry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dick Alford looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"The matter must be left entirely to Leslie," he said, and there was
  something very definite and final in those words.</p>

  <p>They came out of the library together; Leslie, waiting, a little fearful,
  saw the smile on her brother's face and breathed a sigh of thankfulness.</p>

  <p>"You're not going?" Dick was reaching for his cap.</p>

  <p>"I have to get back to the house," he said, and, seeing her look of
  disappointment, he stood irresolutely.</p>

  <p>"Come along in and play mah-jong. I am in a mah-jong mood," said Arthur,
  almost jovially.</p>

  <p>If there was one thing that Dick could not endure that night it was to sit
  vis-à-vis with Arthur Gine. He would like to have stayed with the girl, but
  for the moment her brother seemed an inevitable third. And he was terribly
  informative. Arthur was in his most expansive mood.</p>

  <p>"Here is something that will interest you!"</p>

  <p>He pointed to the wall. Hanging against a dark wooden shield was an iron
  dagger&mdash;black and sinister, the handle worn smooth, the long blade
  notched and jagged. Dick had seen it before.</p>

  <p>"That should be at your place, Alford. The veritable dagger of the
  veritable Black Abbot's slayer&mdash;Hubert of Redruth! Look at his arms on
  the hilt."</p>

  <p>"I have seen it," said Dick shortly. "Put on your coat and come for a
  walk, Leslie," he suggested, and the obliging Arthur, who would have been
  agreeable to any scheme he propounded, seconded the suggestion.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE night was cool and dark. There was a full moon, visible
  at intervals through the drift of the clouds. Leslie slipped her arm through
  his as they walked down the dark avenue towards the road.</p>

  <p>"Did you quarrel?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"N-no, we didn't quarrel," said Dick. "There was a little plain speaking,
  but I think it cleared the air, and, after all, that was what I came for. He
  is dismissing Gilder tomorrow."</p>

  <p>She was silent at this, and did not speak again until they were on the
  road.</p>

  <p>"Is that wise?" she asked. "I'm a little afraid of the man. I feel he
  would be a very bad enemy."</p>

  <p>She heard his soft laugh and felt reassured.</p>

  <p>"He's that all right," said Dick; "the worst enemy any man could have, I
  should imagine. But an enemy is only dangerous in ratio to his hurting power.
  I don't think Mr Gilder will hurt anybody."</p>

  <p>"Not Arthur?" she asked. "Not Arthur, and certainly not you."</p>

  <p>She squeezed his arm in hers. "You'd be a wonderful brother," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"I am," he said curtly, and she smiled in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Your handsome relative asked me to persuade you to marry next month, and
  I told him point-blank that I would do nothing of the kind. Leslie, do you
  know that you never see Harry from one weekend to another?"</p>

  <p>She had realised that for a long time, and it was a constant subject for
  self-reproach that she had less and less desire for her fiancé's society.</p>

  <p>"He is really not interested in me, Dick," she said. "Harry is so absorbed
  in his treasure hunt and his queer chase after the elixir of life&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's told you that, has he?" asked Dick quickly.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course!" she scoffed. "Do you know, Dick, he has almost
  convinced me that there is something in his idea?"</p>

  <p>She waited for him to reply.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think so?"</p>

  <p>"In the Life Water&mdash;perhaps there is."</p>

  <p>"And in the treasure?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Maybe. Generations of Chelfords have hunted for that wretched gold, and I
  suppose in the past four hundred years almost as much money has been spent in
  the search as the treasure is worth! I'm perfectly sure in my own mind that
  Good Queen Bess of pious memory bagged every bar of it!"</p>

  <p>"And I'm perfectly sure she didn't," was the surprising reply. "I've been
  reading Elizabethan history very carefully, and the year that your ancestor
  hid his gold was the year that the Queen was so hard pressed for money that
  she had to borrow from the Lombards."</p>

  <p>He stopped.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. And if you weren't such a sceptic and would read a little
  more, you would know what any schoolchild could tell you, that in 1582 the
  Queen was broke. Do you object to that vulgar word?"</p>

  <p>"It is a familiar one, at any rate," he laughed.</p>

  <p>They had reached the deep cutting, and he turned to the left, opened a
  gate, and they walked up a little path towards the ruins of Chelford
  Abbey.</p>

  <p>The moon was showing through a rift in the clouds.</p>

  <p>"You ought to see the abbey by moonlight, if you've never seen it. It's
  rather beautiful," he said, as he gave her a hand to assist her up the steep
  path.</p>

  <p>As they came in sight of the broken walls and towers of this ancient place
  of peace, something of the solemnity of the scene entered her heart, and she
  stood still, looking spellbound upon the wreckage of a once great abbey. The
  abbey ruins stood on the broadest surface of what was locally known as "The
  Mound"&mdash;the high embankment which ran almost from Fossaway Manor to the
  road, following the course of the little Ravensrill. Here, if tradition spoke
  the truth, a place of sacrifice had stood, before the English church had
  risen in flint, before the Norman monks laid chisel to stone on their great
  abbey.</p>

  <p>The moon softened and idealised the broken stonework, and in her mind she
  went back through the years to those ancient times when the black-robed
  figures of the monks moved where she now stood. Below, to the left, she could
  see the fret of sparkling silver where the moon was reflected in the
  Ravensrill. Here they had sat, these ancient men, with their fishing-rods,
  discussing the little events of their narrow world. They had passed into
  dust, and this great abbey, the pride of their eyes and the work of their
  hands, was crumbling rapidly into like nothingness.</p>

  <p>"It is wonderful!" she breathed.</p>

  <p>Were her eyes deceiving her? She could have sworn she saw something moving
  in the shadow of the old tower. He heard the quick intake of her breath.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;my imagination, I think. I thought I saw somebody
  moving there."</p>

  <p>He followed the direction of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"There would be nobody here at this time of the night, unless it is the
  Black Abbot," he said jocularly, "and we're not scared of him, are we?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not for one," she said, with a firmness that she was far from
  feeling.</p>

  <p>At that moment she heard something&mdash;something that turned her blood
  to water. It was a low moan of anguish, a sobbing diminuendo of sound that
  began on a high note and wailed down the scale until it was inaudible.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" she asked, grasping his arm.</p>

  <p>He did not speak; he was straining his eyes towards the shadows.</p>

  <p>Again the sound, this time a wail that ended in a scream. He caught the
  girl by the shoulder. At that moment he had seen a figure moving away from
  the abbey towards the river. A tall, black figure that showed clearly in the
  moonlight. She saw it too.</p>

  <p>"Don't leave me, Dick!" she begged, as she felt him strain away from
  her.</p>

  <p>Then of a sudden she felt his tension relax.</p>

  <p>"Let him go," he said, half to himself.</p>

  <p>She clung to him desperately, frantically, as the figure stumbled and
  staggered towards the trees that would presently engulf him. The dreadful
  Thing ran on, stopping now and again to turn and gibber and mouth at the man
  and the woman who stood motionless on the edge of the cutting. Waving wild
  arms, now howling in dreadful glee, now screaming in senseless fear, it
  vanished in the dark of the wood&mdash;an obscene, uncleanly thing that
  belonged to bad dreams and the horrid imaginings of madness. Far away in the
  distance came the howl of him, and then the night swallowed him up.</p>

  <p>"How dreadful!"</p>

  <p>And then her knees gave under her and she remembered no more.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p class="first">LESLIE opened her eyes and frowned up into the face that was
  bent over her. She was lying on the verge of the road, for Dick had carried
  her down into the cutting and a hundred yards towards Willow House.</p>

  <p>"Oh, how awful!" she shuddered, and closed her eyes. "It was the Black
  Abbot?"</p>

  <p>Dick Alford did not reply for a while. His anxiety for the girl was such
  that all other interests had passed from his mind.</p>

  <p>"I am all right now," she said, and, with his assistance, stood shakily on
  her feet. "I told you I was a fool. This is my crazy day! Dick, what was
  it?"</p>

  <p>"He was too far away from me to see," said Dick; "probably one of our
  stupid villagers under the influence of drink."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, it was not that, Dick! It was&mdash;" She shuddered again. "I think
  I'd better go home."</p>

  <p>"I think you'd be wise," he said gravely. "I wish I hadn't brought you out
  now."</p>

  <p>She laughed a little shakily and clung to him tighter.</p>

  <p>"In a way I'm glad you did," she said, as they walked slowly towards her
  home. "Dick, I had all sorts of queer dreams: just before I woke up I felt
  somebody kiss me. It was so convincing that I can still feel the lips on my
  cheek."</p>

  <p>"I kissed you," he said, without shame. "I thought the shock would bring
  you to life!"</p>

  <p>Her laughter was almost hysterical, for Leslie's nerves were jangled and
  on edge.</p>

  <p>"You might at least have denied that," she said. "Dick, you have no
  subtlety!"</p>

  <p>As they walked slowly towards the house, she noticed that he looked back
  once or twice.</p>

  <p>"You're not expecting that&mdash;that thing to follow us, are you?" she
  asked, her teeth chattering.</p>

  <p>"No, I thought I heard a car" (which was true). "I'll swear I saw a haze
  of light over the crest of the road, but I must have been mistaken."</p>

  <p>He was not mistaken, and knew it. A car had been following them, had been
  slowly ascending the hill to the cutting; he had seen the reflected rays from
  the lamps distinctly, and had heard the soft purr of the engine. What was
  more certain than anything else, the car could not have turned in that narrow
  road, so that the only explanation was that the unknown driver had switched
  off his lights and stopped his machine.</p>

  <p>"Let me look at you." He turned her to the moonlight and lifted her face.
  "I don't know whether you're horribly pale or whether it's a trick of the
  moon," he said, "but you look mighty ill! You had better go straight to bed,
  preferably without seeing your brother."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I don't want this spook story to get around, for one thing," he said.
  "And for another&mdash;oh, well, the other doesn't matter."</p>

  <p>Leslie realised that she was walking at a much slower pace than her
  physical weakness justified. She was still a little shaky, but in every sense
  had recovered from the shock. Too sane to believe in ghosts, she had
  nevertheless been shaken by the terrible experience. She leaned heavily on
  Dick's arm as they paced up the avenue to the house, turning on to the grass
  so that Arthur should not hear their footsteps and come out to give them a
  boisterous welcome. Presently, with a sigh, she dropped his arm.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad I went out," she said, in a low voice. "And I'm rather
  glad&mdash;" She did not finish the sentence.</p>

  <p>The silence that followed was a little disturbing for both of them.
  Suddenly she faced him.</p>

  <p>"Dick, do you want me to marry your brother?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Do you&mdash;really?"</p>

  <p>She heard his sigh in the dark. She could not see his face, for they stood
  in the shadow of a great cedar immediately before the house.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said. There was a bleakness in his voice she had heard
  once before. "It isn't a question of my liking. I can offer you no reason why
  you should not marry him. You must do what you want, Leslie. The decision
  must rest entirely with you&mdash;and if I were a praying man, I would spend
  the night praying that you did right."</p>

  <p>"Do you wish me to marry him?" she asked again.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you." His voice was hard, and there swept over her a wave
  of unreasonable anger and resentment against his detachment.</p>

  <p>"I won't ask you that question again," she said, her voice trembling.
  "Good night, Dick."</p>

  <p>She ran into the hall and up to her room, and long after she had gone, he
  stood where she had left him, looking wistfully at the door which had closed
  upon her.</p>

  <p>With something like despair at his heart, Dick Alford walked quickly along
  the road towards Fontwell Cutting. He had something to distract his mind for
  the moment.</p>

  <p>There was no sign of the car, and, instead of passing through the cutting
  gates, he continued over the brow of the hill.</p>

  <p>When he went out at night he invariably carried a small flash-lamp (he
  kept a stock of them at the house, for his electric supply had a trick of
  failing at inconvenient moments), and this he took from his pocket, and,
  switching it on, threw the light on the road, sweeping the beam from side to
  side. This was not a main thoroughfare, and, except for his own and Gine's
  car, and an occasional tradesman's Ford, there was little traffic. He saw the
  diamond-shaped impress of Arthur Gine's Rolls, could pick out his own little
  machine, and presently he saw a new track: the track of tyres with an arrow-
  shaped tread. He could distinguish the exact spot at which it had stopped.
  Apparently the driver had made no attempt to turn, but had gone backwards
  some distance. He followed the trail till it curved round, apparently into an
  open field. The wagon gate was closed, but on the loamy earth the mark of
  wheels was very apparent.</p>

  <p>Red Farm, thought Dick, and, opening the gate, he went into the field. His
  search was a very short one, for the deserted car was parked close under the
  hedge parallel with the road. All the lights were out, but the radiator was
  still hot. He examined the machine carefully; it bore a London number and was
  new; an American touring car, replete with all the gadgets of its kind. He
  made a careful note of the number and, walking back to the gate, sat on the
  top rail and waited.</p>

  <p>His vigil was not a protracted one. From where he sat he could see over
  the swelling hill the top curve of the abbey arch, and five minutes after he
  had taken up his position he saw a figure silhouetted against the skyline
  cross the brow and descend the hill towards him.</p>

  <p>Fossaway Park was enclosed in a large-meshed wire-net fence, which offered
  no obstacle to any person who wished to surmount it; but the stranger had
  evidently not reconnoitred the ground very thoroughly, for Dick heard the
  clang of the wire as some heavy object struck against it, a curse, and
  presently he could discern a figure climbing over the wide mesh and dropping
  into the road.</p>

  <p>For a few seconds it was out of sight, and then he saw it again,
  silhouetted against the white of the road. Nearer and nearer it came.</p>

  <p>"Good-evening, Mr Gilder," said Dick politely. "Are you seeing the sights
  of Chelfordbury?"</p>

  <p>Gilder started violently and almost dropped the heavy stick he was
  carrying.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he stammered. "Who the dickens are you?"</p>

  <p>A beam of light shot suddenly from his hand and focussed the
  questioner.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you!" said Gilder, taking a long breath. "Gosh! you scared me! I was
  just admiring your old ruins by moonlight. They're rather fine."</p>

  <p>"On behalf of the ruins I thank you," said Dick, with elaborate courtesy.
  "Any nice things that you can say about Chelford Abbey are deeply appreciated
  by its present owner."</p>

  <p>The man was disconcerted and obviously ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"I left my car in the field; I thought it might get in the way of
  traffic&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"The traffic around here between ten and midnight is not very numerous,"
  said Dick; "but if you have the illusion that Red Farm is your property, it
  is quite understandable that your car should be parked there. What is the
  game, Gilder?"</p>

  <p>He was conscious that the man's eyes were peering at him.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean by 'game.' Is it unlawful to admire a
  moonlight view?"</p>

  <p>"It is unlawful to trespass on my brother's property," said Dick. "May I
  repeat my question: what is the game?"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you. Do you mind letting me get through that gate? I
  am going home."</p>

  <p>Dick Alford descended from the gate slowly and pushed it open.</p>

  <p>"You are a suspicious character, Gilder."</p>

  <p>The man snapped round at him.</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Just what I say. You are a suspicious character. It is very suspicious to
  find you loafing around Fossaway Park at this hour of the night, particularly
  after certain things which have happened recently."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I am the Black Abbot?" sneered the man, and Dick's chuckle
  came from the darkness.</p>

  <p>"There are many interesting possibilities about you, Gilder. What did you
  expect to find in the abbey?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you I was merely admiring the view by moonlight. If that is an
  offence you can bring me before a bench of magistrates."</p>

  <p>Dick, his hands in his pockets, stood watching the man as he switched on
  the lights of the car and started her up.</p>

  <p>"The place to admire the ruins is from the crest of the hill, not from the
  ruin itself," he said. "If you had been a normal admirer you would never have
  been out of sight. May I also suggest that it wasn't necessary to switch off
  your lights or to hide your car&mdash;the best view of the abbey is from the
  upper road. Gilder, you had better be careful."</p>

  <p>"Is that a threat?"</p>

  <p>"It is a warning," said Dick. "And a man as clever as you would not
  lightly despise such a warning. By the way, my solicitors are starting an
  action tomorrow to set aside your agreement with Farmer Leonard. I am hoping
  that you will not involve yourself in the expense of defending the
  action."</p>

  <p>"That is a matter that I shall discuss with your lawyers," said Gilder, as
  he started the car.</p>

  <p>Dick watched the machine as it waddled over the furrows and turned on to
  the road, and followed it out, closing the gate behind it.</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything about racing, Gilder?"</p>

  <p>Gilder turned with a jerk. Was this man privy to his secrets?</p>

  <p>"I know a little&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know what a warning-off notice is?"</p>

  <p>Gilder stared at him open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is a notice issued by the Jockey Club warning people off
  Newmarket Heath."</p>

  <p>"Splendid!" said Dick. "Will you take a warning-off notice from me? I warn
  you off Willow House and all that is contained therein!"</p>

  <p>"And if I don't accept the warning?"</p>

  <p>"You'll be sorry, as I've remarked before," said Dick.</p>

  <p>Gilder jammed in his clutch and the car jerked forward with a whine, and
  soon its tail lights had disappeared round the bend of the road.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <p class="first">THE second son climbed the fence, though the gate was near
  enough, and, passing the abbey ruins, walked briskly towards Fossaway Manor.
  His way brought him past the wing of the house in which his brother's library
  was situated. One of the big leaded windows was open and he caught a glimpse
  of Harry at his desk, sitting in the half-light, his head on his hands, a
  book before him. Dick sighed and continued on his way.</p>

  <p>Thomas, the footman, answered the bell he rang.</p>

  <p>"Get me some coffee and biscuits. I shall be working late," he said.</p>

  <p>When the man had gone, he went to his desk and unlocked the post-bag that
  had come up from the station that night and shook out a heap of letters. He
  sorted them over carefully, and, selecting one, opened it. The letter bore
  the Royal crest and the plain address "New Scotland Yard," and was from an
  old school friend of his.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Dick,</p>

  <p class="letter">Thank you for your rather extraordinary letter, but I am
  afraid we can do nothing for you officially. Private detectives, of course,
  are punk for your purpose, and the best I can do for you is as follows. We
  have a detective sergeant at headquarters named Puttler&mdash;you may have
  seen his name in connection with the Hatton Garden robbery. He's a very
  efficient man and marked for promotion, but rather a weird-looking bird. At
  the Yard we call him 'Monkey Puttler,' though he is universally liked in
  spite of this unflattering sobriquet. Puttler never takes any kind of
  holiday, and is generally supposed to spend his spare time in criminal
  investigation and to sleep in an odd corner of the Yard. He is entitled to
  six weeks' holiday leave. Of course, in ordinary circumstances he would never
  dream of taking six minutes, but I have had a talk with him, and with the
  complete approval of our chief (it was necessary to tell him what you wanted)
  Puttler will spend his holiday at Fossaway Manor. As I said before, he is
  rather a queer-looking creature, a rabid teetotaller, a strong churchman,
  with violent views on church music. You can rely absolutely upon his
  discretion. I've told him that you will pay him ten pounds a week and all his
  expenses. I only wish I could let you have him permanently, but I trust that
  in six weeks your trouble will be cleared up.</p><br>

  <p>Dick put the letter carefully in his inside pocket, and walking across the
  hall, went into the library. Lord Chelford heard the door close and looked
  up.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Dick!" he said, quite amiably. "What is the news?"</p>

  <p>Before he answered, Dick Alford walked to the window through which he had
  seen his brother, pulled it close and fastened the lock.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong?" growled Chelford.</p>

  <p>"Our monkish friend has been seen," he said, "and I think it advisable
  that your window should be kept closed."</p>

  <p>Harry Chelford's hand went up to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Can't we do anything with that fellow?" he asked fretfully. "Where are
  the police? What do we pay them for? It's monstrous that the countryside
  should be terrified by&mdash;Really, Dick, couldn't you do something?"</p>

  <p>"I'm getting a man down tomorrow to make a few investigations," said
  Dick.</p>

  <p>He charged his pipe carefully and lit it with a match which he took from a
  silver container on Harry's table.</p>

  <p>"I've been over to see Leslie," he said. "Put away that infernal book and
  talk."</p>

  <p>With evident reluctance Lord Chelford closed the thick tome over which he
  had been poring and leaned back in his chair with an air of resignation.</p>

  <p>"Leslie? I don't see very much of her," he said. "She's a very intelligent
  girl and knows how busy I am. Not every woman would show so much
  understanding. Did you see Arthur?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"I had a phone message saying that he was coming over in the morning. He
  wants me to sign some documents in connection with Leslie's estate. Good
  fellow, Arthur."</p>

  <p>"Very," said Dick, without a trace of sarcasm in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I owe a lot to Arthur." Harry looked up through his horn-rimmed
  spectacles and nodded as he spoke. "I shouldn't have met Leslie, and
  certainly I shouldn't have had any idea of marrying," he went on naïvely,
  "but Arthur was very keen to get a husband for her who wasn't a
  fortune-hunter. And, of course, the money will be useful."</p>

  <p>Dick listened patiently to this disjointed excuse for the forthcoming
  marriage. He had heard it before in identically the same terms.</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to marry money at all?" he asked. "We're not
  paupers."</p>

  <p>Harry Chelford shrugged his thin shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I suppose we're not," he said indifferently. "I never bother about the
  money side. You're such a clever old bird, Dick, that I'm spared that. By
  heavens, I don't know where I should be if it wasn't for you. Do you get all
  you want yourself, Dicky?"</p>

  <p>Dick Alford nodded.</p>

  <p>"A nice girl," his brother went on, "and, as I say, a sensible girl. I
  wish you'd get her over to dinner one night; there are several things I want
  to talk about to Arthur. There's the Doncaster estate, for example. I had a
  letter from somebody the other day, saying that they were willing to pay a
  very big price for Creethorpes. I don't see any reason in the world why we
  shouldn't sell."</p>

  <p>"But I do," said Dick, puffing slowly at his pipe. "I also have had the
  offer, and when I get one that approximates in my eyes as being near the
  Creethorpes value, we may sell. But the price that has been offered is
  ludicrous."</p>

  <p>"A hundred and twenty thousand pounds?" murmured Lord Chelford, shaking
  his head disparagingly. "I don't see how you can improve on that, Dick."</p>

  <p>"We can try," said Dick.</p>

  <p>His eyes were roaming the desk, and after a while he saw a book which was
  seldom far away from his brother's hand, and, getting up, he reached over and
  took it, Chelford watching with a triumphant smile.</p>

  <p>"It's got you, has it, old man?" he asked. "I thought it would sooner or
  later. You're too sensible to dismiss the Chelford treasure as a myth."</p>

  <p>Dick turned the old pages covered with pale writing: the diary of that
  Lord of Chelford who had suffered for his disloyalty at the hands of the
  common headsman.</p>

  <p>The idea had come to him in the middle of the previous night, and all that
  day the old diary had been in and out of his mind at odd and incongruous
  moments. Whilst it was not true that he had been won over to his brother's
  faith in the existence of the treasure, his curiosity had been piqued by a
  vague recollection of one line in the diary. He turned it up now and
  read:</p>

  <p>These ingots he shall put away in the safe place if yet the weather be dry
  and the drought continue, though rain is near at hand.</p>

  <p>"I am only wondering," he said, as he handed back the book, "what effect
  the drought had upon the hiding place; why rain would have spoilt his plan,
  as apparently it would."</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha!" said his lordship, almost boisterously. "The poison is working,
  Richard! You will become as ardent a treasure-hunter as I. Shall I tell you
  where the gold was hidden?" He leaned forward, his elbows on the table, his
  eyes gleaming. "In a cave, or an underground chamber of some kind. There are
  three references in this diary to a chesil." He turned the pages rapidly.
  "Listen, here is one," he said, and read:</p>

  <p>"This day Tom Goodman brought me the chesil from Brighthelmstone."</p>

  <p>"Which is Brighton, I presume?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>His brother nodded, turning the pages.</p>

  <p>"Here is another reference," he said.</p>

  <p>"The new chesil has come. I have left it near the place, and those dull
  wights who see it will know little of its value to me."</p>

  <p>Dick smiled.</p>

  <p>"It must have been something remarkable in the way of chesils," he said.
  "It doesn't mention its size or its shape."</p>

  <p>"Nowhere; I have searched the diary for that."</p>

  <p>There came a tap at the door; it was Thomas.</p>

  <p>"Will you have your coffee here, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No, put it in my room."</p>

  <p>"Are you working tonight, Dick?" asked Chelford.</p>

  <p>"After you've gone to bed, Harry," said Dick, with a laugh, "and I think
  it is about time you went. One of these days you'll have a breakdown and I'll
  have to call in your pet abomination."</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" shivered Chelford. "Never bring a doctor into this house&mdash;I
  loathe them!"</p>

  <p>He got up, stretched himself with a yawn, and Dick followed him out of the
  room.</p>

  <p>"I shall sleep well tonight," said his lordship, pushing back his long
  black hair with a characteristic gesture. "If I'd only known of that stuff
  before!"</p>

  <p>"What stuff is this?" asked Dick good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>Never a day passed that some new patent medicine did not come into the
  house, some cure-all, accompanied by pages of closely printed literature.
  Lord Chelford's patent medicine habit was a vicious circle. The literature of
  one cure-all revealed symptoms of which he had never been conscious before.
  No sooner had he settled upon a miraculous nostrum than it was superseded by
  one even more dazzling in its promises.</p>

  <p>Dick followed him up the stairs into the long room where he spent the few
  hours he could tear himself away from his library. A four-poster bed, an old
  dressing-chest, a deep closet in which his scanty wardrobe hung, and a very
  long table, the surface of which was literally covered with bottles and small
  boxes, comprised the furniture of his room, with the exception of a battered
  armchair before the fireplace. There must have been over a hundred boxes and
  packages on the table. Some of these came in consequence of standing orders
  given years before, and never countermanded: these had never been opened.
  There were cures for asthma, for bronchitis, for rheumatism, marvellous
  liniments, amazing sleep-inducers, nerve tonics&mdash;every disease to which
  the human system is liable had its antidote in that collection.</p>

  <p>By the side of his bed on a small table was a jug of hot water and a
  glass. Chelford opened a tin chosen from the medley of bottles and boxes,
  took out two small white pellets and dropped them into a glass, covering them
  with water. He stirred them till they were dissolved, Dick watching, half
  amused, half pitiful.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Chelford put down the glass. "That's the stuff! No drugs, Dick
  &mdash; just a mixture of natural elements that bring rest to the tired brain
  and sleep to weary eyes!"</p>

  <p>"I guess you're quoting the label," said Dick, with a laugh. "Even cocaine
  is a natural element. And there's nothing nearer to nature than morphia.
  You're an old goop, Harry, and if I had my way I'd take all these infernal
  bottles and dump them into the round pond."</p>

  <p>"I should probably be dead in a month," said Harry with a smile, as he
  began to undress, "and you'd have to stand your trial for wilful murder!"</p>

  <p>Dick closed the door behind him, waited till he heard the bolt shot home,
  then went downstairs to his own room. His coffee was waiting and he began his
  three-hour task: the opening and answering of letters, the examination of
  leaflets and the inspection of bills. There were cheques to be signed,
  envelopes to be addressed, and it was nearly three o'clock before he rose
  stiffly, and, pushing open the door of the French windows, walked out upon
  the lawn.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a sign of dawn in the sky. The air was sweet and
  pure and he drew great breaths of nature's champagne before he lit his pipe
  and strolled noiselessly along the lawn, keeping parallel with the face of
  the house.</p>

  <p>He had never felt less sleepy, and he was debating in his mind whether he
  should take a cold bath and go on with some work that he had left unfinished
  on the previous day, when he saw, only for a second, a pin-point of light in
  the distance. It was a white, star-like flicker that dawned and disappeared
  almost instantly.</p>

  <p>"If that isn't a flash-lamp I'm a Dutchman," he muttered, went back into
  his room, and, taking down a shotgun, slipped a handful of cartridges into
  the pocket of his dinner jacket.</p>

  <p>There had been a number of poaching affrays in the neighbourhood, and the
  unknown poachers were a desperate gang who had never hesitated to shoot. Dick
  felt it best to be on the safe side, and, with the gun under his arm and two
  shells rammed home into the breech, he strolled across to where he had seen
  the light.</p>

  <p>It is a fact that Dick Alford had no constitutional objection to poachers.
  His views on the subject had shocked many a hoary-headed country justice, for
  Dick held to the line that it was pardonable for any man to "shoot for the
  cooking-pot," and to him poaching was a mild joke.</p>

  <p>The house and surrounding trees obstructed his view, but a five minutes'
  walk brought him through a thin plantation to the Priory fields. Now he saw,
  unless his judgement was at fault, that the light must have come from the
  direction of the abbey ruins. He stood for ten minutes in the shadow of a
  wood, but no light showed. And then, as his foot was raised to walk forward,
  he saw it again&mdash;just a momentary flicker, and this time there was no
  doubt that it came from the abbey. No intelligent poacher would waste five
  minutes on that part of the estate, though there were trout in the
  Ravensrill, and the burrows of a few rabbits in its banks.</p>

  <p>He moved forward steadily up the slope of the Mound, and soon he could
  distinguish the chaos of stone and crumbling walls. The intruder was no
  expert burglar, for again the light flickered. Was it Gilder, he wondered, as
  he followed the course of the little river. Had that sinister man returned to
  admire the view of the abbey by moonlight? The east was turning grey; the
  cold morning wind had freshened; but though he wore only a thin dinner suit,
  Dick did not feel the cold. Stealthily he climbed to the top of the Mound,
  pausing to take observation.</p>

  <p>Again the light, this time not fifty yards away, and he could make out the
  figure of a man moving slowly amidst the broken walls. He was searching the
  ground diligently, his lamp waving to and fro.</p>

  <p>"Lost anything?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>The visitor spun round with a startled cry.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! Who are you?" he asked hoarsely, and Dick recognised the
  voice.</p>

  <p>It was Arthur Gine!</p>

  <p>A painful and embarrassing moment for Arthur Gine!</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he said awkwardly. "I couldn't sleep."</p>

  <p>"Were you looking for an opiate?" asked Dick politely. "You should have
  come up to the house; my brother has a small drug store, and we might have
  been able to find you something for your insomnia."</p>

  <p>"Don't be amusing," growled Arthur, thrown off his balance. "What I meant
  was, I couldn't sleep, so I came out for a walk. This place interests
  me."</p>

  <p>"I did not know you were an archaeologist, and a midnight archaeologist at
  that! The country simply swarms with 'em!" said the ironical young man. "Or
  perhaps you're a moth-hunter? Or did you come out to hear the nightingale?
  It's rather late in the season."</p>

  <p>"See here, Alford, I don't want you to get funny at my expense. I tell you
  I came out for a walk. You're not going to suggest I'm trespassing, are you?
  If it comes to that, what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>He heard Dick chuckle and went hot under the collar.</p>

  <p>"I am attached to the estate: I thought you knew that," said Dick at last;
  "and one of my jobs is to challenge suspicious-looking individuals at
  whatever hour they show themselves or their flash-lamps."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you saw the light, did you? I thought somebody would." Arthur was
  himself again. "The truth is, Dick, I had a horrible dream that woke me up. I
  dreamt I saw that wretched Black Abbot, and the dream was so vivid that I
  resolved to come along and have a look at the place. It was on the edge of
  the cutting that he was last seen."</p>

  <p>"Oh, a ghost-hunter!" murmured Dick. "That, of course, explains
  everything. You came armed, I see? Very wise!"</p>

  <p>Arthur had been praying that this objectionable man would not notice the
  steel crowbar he carried, but the eyes of the other were peculiarly sharp,
  and there was just enough dawn light to reveal the nature of the instrument
  he carried.</p>

  <p>"You didn't see the Black Abbot, I suppose?" said Dick, in his polite
  conversational way. "No? I shouldn't imagine you would. It's rather late for
  him. Our family ghosts keep early hours. They are a respectable lot, and the
  Abbot, as you probably know, was a highly respectable and even a religious
  man, though not, I believe, untouched by the horrid voice of scandal."</p>

  <p>He was walking by Arthur's side to the cut road as he spoke, and the light
  was not good enough for him to see the dull flush that came to that good-
  looking man's face, but he could guess it.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to quarrel with you, Alford, but I have the greatest
  objection to your being sarcastic at my expense. I don't know why I should
  explain anything to you, but you've been a good friend of mine tonight and
  I'm telling you the truth. And, really, it's hardly playing the game to doubt
  my word."</p>

  <p>Dick said nothing to this, but poised himself watchfully on the edge of
  the cutting until the ruffled man had disappeared from sight. What was the
  meaning of all this? he wondered. What attraction had the abbey ruins for
  these strangely assorted people? First Mary Wenner, then Gilder, and now
  Arthur Gine. What was there about these ancient stones which would bring the
  fastidious lawyer from his bed to make an early morning search? He knew
  Arthur rather well, much better, in fact, than he guessed. He hated
  discomfort of all sorts, but here he was, at four o'clock in the morning,
  absurdly but suitably attired in a golf suit of irreproachable pattern, a
  crowbar in one hand and an electric torch in the other, turning over the
  rubbish of the abbey and seeking&mdash;what? The treasure!</p>

  <p>Not till that moment did the solution flash upon Dick Alford, and he was
  so overcome that he sat down on the nearest sandstone block and laughed till
  the tears came into his eyes.</p>

  <p>The treasure! Harry had infected these prosaic people with his obsession.
  But how? Obviously, Mary Wenner was the connecting link. There was a time, he
  remembered, when she was an enthusiastic seconder to Harry's efforts, and
  believed as implicitly in the existence of this mythical gold as did her
  employer. Arthur was a friend of hers: he had heard them "Arthur" and "Mary"
  one another; and, through Arthur, Gilder must have come into the knowledge.
  So that was the explanation! And the Chelford treasure was obviously the
  windfall that Arthur Gine expected.</p>

  <p>He was smiling to himself all the way back to the house, until a thought
  came into his mind that turned the joke of it. Suppose they were right and he
  was wrong? Suppose there was a treasure to be found? No sooner did the
  thought occur than he had laughed it out of his mind. These people merely
  reflected Harry's enthusiasm and faith.</p>

  <p>He fastened the door of his study and went up to the room that overlooked
  the gardens of Fossaway Manor. Immediately opposite his door was a narrow
  passageway ending in stairs as narrow that led to the servants' quarters. As
  his step sounded on the grand stairway, a shadowy figure that had been
  prowling about the corridor slipped into the narrow entrance and crouched
  down. Thomas, the footman, saw Dick go into his room and close the door, and
  he breathed more freely. He waited, but he could hear no movement.</p>

  <p>Silence reigned in Fossaway Manor. No sound came from the world outside.
  In five minutes Dick was lying in a profound slumber. He had drawn down the
  blinds that the light should not break his rest, and the room was in almost
  complete darkness.</p>

  <p>Ordinarily he would have heard a sound, the sound of the floor-boards
  creaking outside his door, and would have been awake instantly. Twice the
  planks creaked under a heavy weight, but he did not stir. And then the handle
  of his door turned slowly and the door itself moved the fraction of an inch.
  The thing outside listened, showing its white teeth in a grin. The sound of
  Dick Alford's regular breathing came out to him and he pushed the door open a
  little farther, and, crouching, moved stealthily towards the bed, feeling for
  the brass rail at the foot.</p>

  <p>Not a sound came from the intruder, and yet he was shaking with laughter.
  He fumbled in his pocket and took out a long-bladed clasp knife and opened it
  carefully, testing the edge with his thumb. Then, slowly, his long fingers
  went out to locate the position of the body. The Angel of Death hovered in
  that second above the sleeping man.</p>

  <p>From the hall below came a woman's voice&mdash;distraught&mdash;beside
  herself with fear.</p>

  <p>"Dick&mdash;Dick, for God's sake!"</p>

  <p>Dick turned uneasily in his sleep and half opened his eyes.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <p class="first">"DICK!"</p>

  <p>It was a girl's voice, sharp with fear, that came from the hall below.</p>

  <p>"Dick!"</p>

  <p>The thing with the knife dropped the weapon and, cringing back towards the
  door, hesitated a second, and slipped out.</p>

  <p>"Dick!"</p>

  <p>Again the voice, and Dick woke. Was he dreaming? Slipping out of bed, he
  threw open the door and walked on to the landing.</p>

  <p>"Who's calling?" he asked, husky with sleep.</p>

  <p>"It is I&mdash;Leslie! Dick, I want you."</p>

  <p>He went back to his bedroom, pulled a dressing-gown from a hook and raced
  down the stairs, dressing as he went. She was standing in the gloom of the
  hall, a slim figure. She had no hat; her bare feet were thrust into slippers,
  and she wore an overcoat over what was evidently a hastily assumed skirt.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, dear?"</p>

  <p>He pushed open the door of his study and led her in. She was trembling
  from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Something dreadful has happened," she gasped. "I thought my
  car would wake you&mdash;didn't you hear it?"</p>

  <p>"Something dreadful has happened? What?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I suppose I've got everything out of proportion&mdash;I saw
  Arthur fighting with a man on the lawn. It was dreadful. I thought I must
  have been mistaken and went to his room, but the bed was empty and had not
  been slept in. By the time I could get downstairs on to the lawn, they had
  disappeared. Oh, Dick, what can have happened?"</p>

  <p>"Fighting?" He was incredulous. "I saw Arthur&mdash;I don't know how long
  ago; it may have been an hour or two. I don't know how long I've been
  sleeping."</p>

  <p>It was daylight now; the clock over the mantelpiece showed it to be a
  quarter past five.</p>

  <p>"Just wait a moment. I'll be with you in a jiffy."</p>

  <p>He ran up the stairs and in five minutes rejoined her, dressed, and,
  lifting her into the car, he sent the little machine flying down the
  drive.</p>

  <p>"How did you get into the house?"</p>

  <p>"I came through your study. I rang the bell at the door, but nobody
  answered me. And then I tried your French windows and they were open."</p>

  <p>"I'm always forgetting to lock them. I'm glad I did. And they will never
  be locked in the future," said Dick. "Now just tell me what happened?"</p>

  <p>She told her story coherently. Her very association with this man had
  restored her failing courage. And as she grew calmer she became penitent.</p>

  <p>"What a scare-cat you will think I am!" she said ruefully. "I don't know
  what time it was&mdash;about half an hour ago, I think&mdash;but I was
  sleeping when I heard voices. I went to the window and looked out. It was
  still rather dark; there are an awful lot of trees before the house; but I
  could see two men, and I wouldn't have known one of them was Arthur, only I
  heard him speaking angrily."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear anything he said?"</p>

  <p>"No, they were too far away. They were near the laurels that hide the
  house from the road. And then I saw Arthur strike the man, and they began to
  struggle, and that is all I saw. By the time I'd got downstairs they had
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>"But you say you saw him? How could you?"</p>

  <p>Dick gave a version of his encounter with the lawyer that was more
  flattering to Arthur than was deserved.</p>

  <p>"But that couldn't be true!" she said, in perplexity. "He hadn't been to
  bed at all. What is the meaning of it, Dick?"</p>

  <p>"The Lord knows!" said Dick piously. "I wish my friend Puttler was
  here."</p>

  <p>The car ran through the cutting and took the long, straight road to Willow
  House; they were turning into the drive when Dick saw a man walking in front
  of him.</p>

  <p>"There's your Arthur," he said, and she uttered a little cry of
  thankfulness.</p>

  <p>It was Arthur with a difference. His nose had been bleeding, one of his
  eyes was slightly discoloured. In other circumstances Dick would have
  laughed, but the girl was so concerned with her brother's injuries that it
  would have been brutal even to find anything amusing in the discomfiture of
  this dandified young lawyer.</p>

  <p>"It was nothing," he said gruffly. "I met a poacher and had a slight
  argument with him."</p>

  <p>The knees of his new golfing knickers were soiled and torn; the knuckles
  of his hand were red and bleeding. Dick felt that it was not the moment to
  ask him questions, and followed the brother and sister into the house, an
  interested and cautious observer of events.</p>

  <p>The servants had been roused and one of them brought some coffee, and
  Dick, who had been half dead from sleepiness, accepted the steaming cup
  gratefully.</p>

  <p>"What do you think has happened, Dick?" she asked, when Arthur had gone up
  to his room to treat his injuries, having refused all the assistance she
  offered.</p>

  <p>"I think he has told us what has happened. He had trouble with a poacher.
  In other words, he had a vulgar fight. It is one of those distressing
  happenings that the best of men cannot always avoid."</p>

  <p>She shot a suspicious glance at him.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that, Dick. And it couldn't have been a poacher. I'm
  perfectly sure it was Mr Gilder."</p>

  <p>Dick was not prepared to contest this point of view. The probability of
  Arthur's assailant being his head clerk was one that had occurred to him. But
  why should Gilder be in the vicinity of Willow House at that hour of the
  morning? At a suitable opportunity he would ask Arthur Gine for the
  truth.</p>

  <p>He was conscious that she was looking at him, and, meeting her eyes, he
  saw something that made him catch his breath.</p>

  <p>"What shall I ever do without you?" she asked, with a gesture of
  helplessness. "I run to you crying every time I am hurt, and you appear by
  magic whenever I'm in trouble! Dick, one of these days I'm going to be a
  disgrace to my sex!"</p>

  <p>"I hope not, Leslie," he smiled. "What particularly outrageous thing have
  you in mind?"</p>

  <p>She nodded wisely.</p>

  <p>"You will see," she said. "I also can be mysterious!"</p>

  <p>He declined the loan of her car and returned on foot to the house. Unless
  Harry's sleeping draught had taken effect, he would have heard the car, for
  his room faced the drive. But no sound came from the King's Chamber, as his
  sleeping apartment was magniloquently termed, and Dick went to his room and
  took off his clothes.</p>

  <p>He was getting into bed when his foot touched something hard and shiny,
  and, stooping, he picked it up.</p>

  <p>"Moses!" said Dick under his breath, and switched on the light.</p>

  <p>The knife was a new one, its edge razor-sharp. He turned it over and over
  in his hand and frowned. Then, walking to the door, he locked it; and Dick
  did not usually sleep behind a locked door. But he realised that the twenty-
  four hours through which he was passing were pregnant with unpleasant
  possibilities.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE office of Gine &amp; Gine was thrown into some disorder
  the next morning by a most unexpected occurrence. Mr Fabrian Gilder, for the
  first time in his twenty-five years' association with the business, did not
  put in an appearance. Instead came a note to the senior clerk, asking that a
  certain drawer in his desk should be opened and the contents thereof sent by
  special messenger to Mr Gilder's house in Regent's Park. There was a
  postscript to the note.</p>

  <p>It is unlikely that I shall return to the business. I have handed my
  resignation to Mr Gine, and intend to devote my time to the development of my
  private affairs.</p>

  <p>A wire from Arthur Gine appointed the senior clerk to take the place of
  the retired Gilder: an arrangement not altogether to the satisfaction of the
  senior clerk, for there were unpleasant whisperings about Gine &amp; Gine,
  hints of dire developments to come that made the older members of the staff
  quake in their shoes.</p>

  <p>Arthur did not appear that day, nor the next, and the mystery of Gilder's
  resignation remained unsolved, for the confidential messenger who carried his
  papers to his flat, and who expected to hear from him the reason for his
  sudden departure, was not admitted. Mr Gilder was in bed; he had come up from
  the country early in the morning and had met with a slight accident whilst
  getting out of his car. Apparently he had remained awake long enough to write
  his letter to the office, but was now sleeping, so the servant said. And she
  spoke the truth, though he did not sleep as soundly as he might have done had
  his lips not been cut and his shoulder slightly strained. You cannot indulge
  in fisticuffs in the uncertain light of dawn without incurring a certain
  amount of damage.</p>

  <p>Curiosity was not the besetting vice of Dick Alford; even if it had been,
  he would not have spared the time to make a call at Gine &amp; Gine's to
  discover the extent of Mr Gilder's damage. He had his bath and shaved just
  before lunch, and came downstairs to find that the noon train had brought him
  a visitor.</p>

  <p>Sergeant Puttler he recognised, though he had never seen him before, from
  the description that his friend had sent him. He was a tall, gaunt man of
  forty. The tired-looking brown eyes that gazed with gentle melancholy from
  their deep sockets reminded Dick of a sick and sorrowful chimpanzee he had
  once seen. His forehead was low, his upper lip long, and his arms reached
  almost to his knees. These features, added to a constitutional stoop,
  contributed to his unprepossessing appearance. Poor Mr Puttler was not
  unaware of the simian mould in which his frame was cast, and it was,
  apparently, a matter which alternately depressed and pleased him.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, how do you like me?" he said without a smile, though there was
  a twinkle of malicious joy in his brown eyes. "I've known people to faint the
  first time they've seen me, especially romantical people."</p>

  <p>"I shan't faint," smiled Dick, "possibly because I'm not romantical."</p>

  <p>The footman came in at that moment, and evidently romance tinged his soul,
  for at the sight of the strange, long-armed man he visibly staggered and
  blinked.</p>

  <p>"Take Mr Puttler up to his room. Afterwards, Puttler, come and dine and I
  have something to tell you."</p>

  <p>The dazed Thomas led the way up the stairs to a room next door to that
  occupied by Dick. The housekeeper had been warned of his coming and the room
  was ready. He deposited his suitcase and took stock of his rather handsome
  surroundings.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything further I can do, sir?" asked Thomas.</p>

  <p>Sergeant Puttler blinked at him.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, thank you." And, as Thomas was going: "What do you call yourself
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Me, sir&mdash;my name is Thomas Luck."</p>

  <p>Puttler shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"Thomas Bad Luck," he said; "William Hard Lines or Henry Too Bad. Does
  your master know that your name is Sleisser and that you've done a stretch in
  Dartmoor?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the man sullenly.</p>

  <p>"He will, Thomas&mdash;he will," said the detective gently, and with
  murder in his eyes the footman slunk out of the room.</p>

  <p>Mr Puttler came downstairs purring with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that is my room, Mr Alford?" he asked. "Not expecting the
  Prince of Wales, are you? I've always been ambitious to sleep in a four-
  poster bed. Now, Mr Alford."</p>

  <p>"First of all, I must introduce you to my brother. By the way, he is
  rather of a nervous disposition, and I've told him that you're a member of an
  accountancy firm who has come down to help me with my books."</p>

  <p>Mr Puttler expressed his agreement with this mild form of deception. He
  was taken to the big library and formally introduced. Harry Chelford was so
  used to the advent of Dick's extraordinary guests that he saw nothing unusual
  in the appearance of the simian Puttler. Happily, he was near-sighted, and
  though it was a startling experience to find himself shaking hands across a
  very broad desk, which an ordinary man could not have spanned, he did not
  realise the cause of the phenomenon.</p>

  <p>Dick entertained accountants, land agents, an occasional bailiff or two,
  so that there was no novelty in the invitation. Learned-looking strangers
  came to his table from time to time and were introduced and passed out of his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"He will be staying six weeks," Dick had told him, "and you mustn't object
  to his prowling round the place, because I want to get a true valuation of
  the estate, and he has his own peculiar methods."</p>

  <p>"You might get him to price the Black Abbot," said Harry, half dourly,
  half amused. "What we want, Dick, is not so much a valuer as a good
  policeman."</p>

  <p>Dick Alford thought that the guest might fulfil both functions, but he did
  not say so.</p>

  <p>He ushered his visitor back to his own little office, carefully closed the
  door and sat down at his desk.</p>

  <p>"Now make yourself comfortable. Do you smoke?"</p>

  <p>Mr Puttler fumbled in his pocket and produced a black pipe.</p>

  <p>"It's not very aristocratic," he apologised, "but I prefer 'bacca to
  cigars and cigarettes."</p>

  <p>"I'll join you," said Dick.</p>

  <p>His study had two doors: one that opened into the hall and one into a side
  corridor running back to the housekeeper's room. The two men had been talking
  for ten minutes, though, as far as Mr Puttler was concerned, his contribution
  to the discourse was limited to an occasional question, when Thomas came
  noiselessly down the side corridor, peeped into the hall and walked back to
  the study door. There was a look of apprehension upon his lean and shapeless
  face which was not without cause. Stooping, he put his eye to the keyhole. He
  could just see the end of the settee and the head and shoulders of the
  strange visitor. He was holding something in his hand&mdash;a white-handled
  knife&mdash;and was examining it with curiosity. Thomas bent his head and
  pressed his ear against the hole.</p>

  <p>Dick's back was to the door and he was speaking in a lower tone than
  usual, and this reacted to the disadvantage of the eavesdropper, for only a
  few distinct and intelligible sentences came to him.</p>

  <p>"...might have been somebody admitted to the house by one of the
  servants," was the first thing he heard. A few minutes later, Mr Puttler,
  whose voice was distinct, asked: "Was the window in the library open?" And he
  heard Dick say "Yes," and add something which he could not catch.</p>

  <p>The soles and heels of Thomas' boots were of rubber. He passed into the
  hall and made another reconnaissance, then returned to his listening post, in
  time to hear Dick say: "My brother hasn't an enemy in the world. I am afraid
  I can't say the same&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Once the listener caught the word "treasure," and once he heard the name
  of "Arthur Gine," but in what association he could not learn. Again Thomas
  visited the hall. He could not take the risk of being seen listening at the
  door. He was free from observation so far as he knew. The old Chelford butler
  was in the servants' hall. Dick and his brother did not lunch till two, an
  unholy hour from the point of view of servants, but very suitable for Dick
  and his peculiar occupation.</p>

  <p>He squinted through the keyhole again. The detective still had the knife
  in his hand and was looking at it intently. He heard him say, "This is new,"
  and then Dick entered upon a long and apparently explanatory statement, not a
  word of which came to the disgusted man who was listening. He was most
  anxious to hear some reference to himself, but, if it was made, he did not
  overhear his name.</p>

  <p>Soon after, however, a familiar phrase caught his ear. Dick Alford was
  talking about the Black Abbot, and he heard rather a sketchy description of
  that spook. Then his voice dropped again, and coincident with this Thomas
  heard the stately footsteps of the butler, slipped back to the housekeeper's
  room and was busy in the pantry when the stout Mr Glover found him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

  <p class="first">THE luncheon was not a genial meal. Harry had acquired the
  disgraceful habit of bringing a book to his meals, and he was utterly
  absorbed in the volume, and left Dick and his visitor to carry on a
  conversation as though he were not present.</p>

  <p>Mr Puttler, who was a man of wide experience, was neither embarrassed by
  his magnificent surroundings&mdash;for Lord Chelford lived in a princely
  style, three footmen and a butler waiting upon them&mdash;nor did he feel it
  necessary to live up to the state in which he found himself. He was
  altogether unaffected, had a fund of anecdotes and could tell funny stories
  without apparently enjoying them himself, which is the art of amusement. Only
  once did Dick interrupt his brother's reading.</p>

  <p>"Leslie is coming to tea," he said. "She phoned over just before
  lunch."</p>

  <p>Harry Alford looked up and his face fell.</p>

  <p>"That is very unfortunate," he said. "I had promised myself an
  uninterrupted afternoon with Fra Hiekler. I've just had a facsimile edition
  sent to me from Leipzig. Hiekler, you remember, Dick, was a cloistered monk
  in the days of Elizabeth, our abbey being one of the few that was not
  interfered with by Henry the Eighth or by Elizabeth either; partly, I think,
  because our particular order of monks were antagonistic to the Jesuits."</p>

  <p>Dick listened patiently, and when his brother had exhausted the history of
  the Black Fathers of Chelfordbury:"You'll have to be civil and come to tea,
  and after that I've no doubt Leslie will not object to your going back to Fra
  Hiekler, who was a German, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"He was a German," said Harry gravely. "And the circumstances which
  brought him to Chelfordbury were rather peculiar."</p>

  <p>"The best German I ever read about"&mdash;it was Mr Puttler who
  interrupted&mdash;"was Robinson Crusoe."</p>

  <p>Dick thought it was a crude jest on the part of his guest, but, if it was
  so, Mr Puttler was unconscious of his humour. Harry stared at the
  "accountant." He took such statements as these very seriously indeed.</p>

  <p>"I am not well acquainted with Robinson Crusoe," he said, "but surely you
  are wrong in saying that he was a German? I have always regarded such
  characters as typically English."</p>

  <p>"He was a German," said Mr Puttler firmly, "though few people are aware of
  the fact. If you look at the first page of the story you'll see these words:
  'My father was a merchant of Bremen,' and Bremen's in Germany, or I'm a
  Dutchman. And if his father was a German, he was a German, because there was
  no such thing as naturalisation in those days."</p>

  <p>Having dropped his literary thunderbolt, Puttler was prepared to take up
  the subject which Dick had interrupted by his question.</p>

  <p>"The trouble with church music, Mr Alford, is that it's a little too
  sugary. It appeals to the senses. I've had many an argument with my brother
  churchwardens&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are you a churchwarden?" asked Dick, in surprise.</p>

  <p>Again the gleam of laughter in the man's deep-set eyes.</p>

  <p>"It's hard to believe," he said modestly, "but I am."</p>

  <p>Soon after this, Harry left the table, and was gone five minutes, when he
  returned with a fat volume under his arm.</p>

  <p>"You're right, Mr&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Puttler," suggested Dick.</p>

  <p>"You're right about Robinson Crusoe. What an extraordinary fact, to think
  that one has lived all one's life under such a mistaken impression!"</p>

  <p>This evidence of literary skill on the part of the visitor brought a
  remarkable change in Harry's attitude. Before, Puttler might have had no
  existence. He was one with the milkman, the grocer and the village
  postman.</p>

  <p>He took Puttler affectionately by the arm, and led him into the library,
  and there Dick left them, knowing exactly the course of instruction that Mr
  Puttler would receive; for Harry's first act was to unlock his desk and take
  out the Diary. Dick was relieved to have Puttler off his hands for an hour or
  two. That day he was experiencing a sense of unbelievable relief. A great
  burden had been lifted from his shoulders, and one of his more pressing and
  secret troubles had been half dissipated.</p>

  <p>He ran halfway down the drive to meet Leslie's car, and leapt on the
  running-board while the car was moving.</p>

  <p>"Practising for a tram-conductor," he said cheerily. "I've decided on my
  profession, when you arrive at Fossaway Manor, mistress of all these
  demesnes."</p>

  <p>"When will that be, Dick?" she asked, looking steadily ahead.</p>

  <p>"Never, I hope."</p>

  <p>In his lightness of heart he had not kept that usual guard on his tongue,
  and the words were out before he could stop them. Twice he had been taken off
  his guard, and he would have given anything to unsay his words.</p>

  <p>Apparently she did not attach any great significance to them, for she did
  not turn her head, sending the car spinning to the broad gravelled place
  before the old porch. He jumped down when she stopped the machine and helped
  her alight.</p>

  <p>"I have to prepare you for a curious bird," he said, and described Mr
  Puttler with more truth than flattery.</p>

  <p>"What is he, Dick?"</p>

  <p>"He's an accountant," said Dick glibly. "He's also quite an amusing fellow
  and full of weird information. I'm going to try a little on you. Do you know
  that Robinson Crusoe was a German?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course, his father lived in Bremen," she said, and he was still
  laughing when he took her into the library.</p>

  <p>In the presence of his fiancée Lord Chelford exhibited a nervousness and a
  gaucherie which might have been understandable if he were meeting her for the
  first time. He had never quite overcome the novelty of his engagement, and
  his attitude towards her was one of awe rather than of reverence.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Leslie?"</p>

  <p>He had never kissed her in his life; now he held her hand for a fraction
  of a second and dropped it as though it burnt him.</p>

  <p>"Do you know Mr Tuttler?"</p>

  <p>"Puttler," said the other, and Leslie looked into the melancholy eyes and
  read something in them that Dick had missed, and possibly Mr Puttler's
  closest associate had not seen.</p>

  <p>She did not pay him the poor compliment of feeling sorry for him, though
  she read in those quick-lighting deeps a craving for woman's sympathy which
  Nature, by her cruel handiwork, had repelled in advance.</p>

  <p>"Glad to know you, Miss Gine. I know your brother&mdash;Mr Arthur Gine,
  the solicitor, isn't it? I thought so."</p>

  <p>"Has Arthur come?" asked Harry.</p>

  <p>"No," said Dick. "We're going to have tea in the drawing-room. Will you
  come along, Harry?"</p>

  <p>"Surely, surely," he said hastily. "You'll excuse me, dear." It was an
  effort to employ even so banal an expression of affection.</p>

  <p>When they reached the beautiful drawing-room, with its windows open to the
  terrace, and a riot of gorgeous sulphur chrysanthemums showing above the
  stone balustrade, they found they were alone. Mr Puttler had melted away as
  they were passing through the hall. He explained afterwards that he wanted to
  stroll through the gardens, but the girl knew that the man's uncanny instinct
  had told him that, of all the people in the world, these two were satisfied
  best with one another's company.</p>

  <p>"Did you sleep?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I didn't get up till lunch time," he said. "And you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I couldn't sleep. Poor Arthur!"</p>

  <p>"Did you try beefsteak?" he asked brutally. "Really, the most incongruous
  company I can imagine is a black eye and Arthur Gine!"</p>

  <p>"He is awfully shaken," she said seriously. "I have never known him to be
  so upset. It was Mr Gilder."</p>

  <p>"I knew," said Dick, "or, at least, I guessed. Did you find out the cause
  of the quarrel?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I don't know; I think it was something to do with me."</p>

  <p>"What was Gilder doing at your house?"</p>

  <p>"Arthur didn't tell me," she replied. "From what he said I gather that Mr
  Gilder had been watching Arthur and had followed him somewhere."</p>

  <p>"To the abbey ruins&mdash;yes, that is quite possible. And of course your
  brother objected to that, naturally. Why are they watching one another?"</p>

  <p>"Is Arthur watching Gilder?" she asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"It almost looks like it. Leslie, I want to tell you something that nobody
  else knows, not even Harry. It may bring a little ease to your mind in the
  dark hours of the night. Puttler is a detective, a Scotland Yard man."</p>

  <p>She stared at him.</p>

  <p>"A detective? Why on earth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Things have been happening that I don't very much like," said Dick. "I've
  been worried nearly sick about them, and though I'm quite capable of dealing
  with most contingencies, the Lord has ordained that I should take seven
  hours' rest in every twenty-four, and there must be somebody awake when I'm
  asleep."</p>

  <p>"The Black Abbot&mdash;is that what is worrying you?"</p>

  <p>He bit his lip thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes and no. Some aspects of the Black Abbot's activities trouble me more
  than I should like to confess. Leslie, do you believe in the treasure?"</p>

  <p>"The Chelford treasure?" she asked, in surprise. "And what do you mean by
  believing in it? It is true that the gold was brought to Fossaway Manor in
  olden times, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly true," said Dick, "and perfectly true, I should imagine, that
  it was taken away. But do you believe that it has any existence, that it can
  be found? Suppose one dug up every square inch of the park, pulled down this
  old house of ours, probed into the bowels of the earth, do you think it is
  possible that the gold could be found? Because, if you don't, there are other
  people who do besides Harry."</p>

  <p>"Do you believe?" she challenged.</p>

  <p>He heaved a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows, I'm ready to believe anything! And I thought I should never
  drag down my lofty intelligence to such deeps. But, Leslie, my dear, I am
  getting&mdash;" He paused for a word.</p>

  <p>"Convinced?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly convinced, but shaken in my obstinacy. I've become a doubter
  of my own scepticism, and that's the worst mental condition a man can
  reach&mdash;or almost the worst," he added.</p>

  <p>"Does Harry know you are a convert?" Her fine eyes twinkled with
  mischief.</p>

  <p>"He suspects me," said Dick gloomily. "If I thought the money was
  here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She regarded him steadily.</p>

  <p>"Would it make a big difference to you, Dick?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Me personally?" He shook his head. "Lord, no! It would make a difference
  to the&mdash;" He paused. "To Harry. I was going to say the estate. The
  estate, to me, is something distinct from any personality. It stands for the
  agglomeration of dead men's efforts, the cumulative sum of all their
  strivings."</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a long time in wonder. She loved him in this serious
  mood of his.</p>

  <p>"You've made rather a fetish of Fossaway Manor and the Chelford estates,
  haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"Have I?" He was genuinely surprised. "I wonder&mdash;" And then he
  laughed. "It isn't a bad line for a second son to exalt the estates to which
  he will never succeed, above the personality of the man who will get them! It
  makes him rather superior to the real heir. Put my fetish worship down to
  vanity, for the Lord knows I have my share of that."</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," she said quietly. "Come out on to the terrace. Your flowers
  are lovely."</p>

  <p>"Everything in the garden&mdash;" he began, but she checked him with a
  warning finger.</p>

  <p>"If you get vulgar I shall go in and find Puttler."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

  <p class="first">SHE leaned on the grey stone balustrade and looked down upon
  the wind-stirred tresses of great golden chrysanthemums, each as big as a
  large-sized saucer. They were not all gold; there were deep red blooms and
  snowy white and flaming orange, and beyond them a huge bed of late-flowering
  roses; even from this distance she could sniff the delicate fragrance of
  them.</p>

  <p>"It's a beautiful old place," she said in a hushed voice. "I don't wonder
  that you love it. How long has your family owned this estate, Dick?"</p>

  <p>"Eight hundred years," he said. "The first of the Chelfords sliced off the
  head of the original owner and stole the property. Successive generations of
  Chelfords, whose own heads were cut off with monotonous regularity, enclosed
  a few thousand acres of common-land belonging to the people&mdash;and there
  you are!"</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"You have very few illusions, have you?"</p>

  <p>"None," was his curt reply, and somehow the answer hurt her.</p>

  <p>They had to send twice for Harry before he put in an appearance, and he
  seemed disappointed to find that Puttler was not there.</p>

  <p>"That is quite an intelligent fellow, Dick," he said, delicately spearing
  a cucumber sandwich. "He has an extraordinary knowledge of history,
  particularly English history. Unfortunately, he doesn't read German" (Harry
  read German as well as he read English, French or Italian), "but I have
  persuaded him to take up the study. Have you everything you want,
  Leslie?"</p>

  <p>He had helped her to nothing, and was happy to find that her requirements
  had been supplied. Only twice he spoke to her: once to ask about Arthur, and
  the other time when he made an oblique reference to his forthcoming
  marriage.</p>

  <p>"Marriage ceremonies and the pomp of them are a little indelicate, I
  think. It is a barbarous custom, these veils and bridesmaids and barbaric
  orange-blossoms. Now in America I am told that it is quite the usual thing to
  be married in a drawing-room. I'm sure that could be arranged, couldn't it,
  Dick? The bishop is quite an obliging old gentleman."</p>

  <p>"Turn Puttler on him: he's an authority on church ritual," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"The man is an authority on most things," said Harry, with unaccustomed
  enthusiasm. "He was telling me that possibly there was some cryptogram in
  existence which would give a direct clue as to the treasure." And then,
  seeing the half-smile on the girl's face, he gave one of his rare boyish
  laughs. "We are still chasing shadows, Leslie, but it is a very substantial
  shadow, believe me. Now, Puttler thinks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They listened without comment to Puttler's views, which in this case were
  neither informative nor particularly brilliant.</p>

  <p>"Puttler's mind apparently runs to dungeons, and there are dungeons to
  this place," said Harry vigorously. "I am going to have a look round
  tomorrow. There are probably secret places under the floor which might be
  profitably examined."</p>

  <p>"The dungeons, as you call them, are wine-cellars," said Dick ominously;
  "and if Puttler goes fooling around my port there will be trouble! Besides
  which, Harry, I don't suppose there has been a single ancestor of ours who
  hasn't dug up the floor of that unfortunate dungeon&mdash;one of them in the
  days of the Regency had the walls stripped, and the beggar never replaced the
  stone. It cost our father the best part of a thousand pounds to repair the
  damage done by this old gold-hound!"</p>

  <p>Dick noticed that whilst Harry was present the girl's manner was just a
  little strained and unreal, and she was nervous too, started when she was
  addressed and was content to listen without including herself in the
  conversation. It was not until Harry had gone, with a lame apology, back to
  the library that she became her real self again, and the old Leslie crept
  forth from its hiding-place. Once, whilst Dick and his brother were
  discussing the affair of the dungeons, she had walked on to the terrace, and
  out of the corner of his eye he saw her in profile, a slim, frail-looking
  girl, with her delicate face and her glorious hair, and in the setting she
  looked almost ethereal. It was as though some old masterpiece of Botticelli
  had come to life.</p>

  <p>When the door had closed on Harry she came back and sat down with a little
  grimace.</p>

  <p>"Was it very rude of me to go out? Dicky, I can't work up any interest in
  the things that really fascinate Harry! Whatever will he talk about when the
  treasure is found?"</p>

  <p>"The treasure? Oh, you mean the gold? He will probably talk about
  you."</p>

  <p>She made a little moue.</p>

  <p>"I'm too young to be interesting to Harry, three hundred years too young,"
  she said. "Now tell me about your detective. I liked what I saw of him. He is
  to be your little guardian angel? And, Dick, will he have a beat&mdash;is
  that the word? Because, if he has, I do hope he'll take in Willow House. I'll
  even lend him my car."</p>

  <p>"Are you really frightened?"</p>

  <p>She thought for a while before she replied.</p>

  <p>"I think I am," she said. "When I was a child the first air-raids
  fascinated me, the second were interesting, but after the third or fourth
  they became&mdash;just air-raids. And the Black Abbot&mdash;well, he's very
  picturesque, Dick, but he's rather terrifying. Didn't you tell me that Harry
  feared him?"</p>

  <p>"He does a little."</p>

  <p>"Why, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>"Harry is naturally of a nervous temperament," said Dick. "People are born
  that way, and it is absurd to talk of 'cowardice' where they are concerned.
  Now I was born without the knowledge of nerves, and I daresay if you saw me
  chasing the Black Abbot you would think I was terribly brave. As a matter of
  fact, it is simply because I've no imagination."</p>

  <p>"That isn't true," she said. "Why do you always belittle yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Because I am by nature excessively modest," he said gravely, and at that
  moment they caught sight of Mr Puttler strolling through the long lines of
  rose trees that ran parallel with the eastern wing. Together they went down
  the terrace steps and intercepted him.</p>

  <p>"It is a lovely place," said Mr Puttler, shaking his head in admiration.
  "I've never seen so many roses together in my life, except at Covent Garden
  market, and they're not roses, they're just merchandise."</p>

  <p>"I've told Miss Gine that you're a detective, Puttler."</p>

  <p>Puttler frowned at this.</p>

  <p>"You know Miss Gine better than I do," he said good-humouredly. "Speaking
  for myself, I find that life is much easier to live if you keep your mouth
  shut. Not," he added hastily, "that I want to be offensive. That's only my
  way of reasoning and my way of talking. There used to be an officer in our
  division who rose from the rank of plain police constable to superintendent
  by the simple process of never saying anything to anybody. If he was asked
  for his opinion on a matter he used to shake his head and say there was much
  to be said on both sides, but he had his own private opinion, and even when
  he was called into a case he'd say nothing, but listen to what everybody else
  said and smile. That smile was worth a thousand a year to him."</p>

  <p>They crossed the rose garden and were strolling across the lawn. Under a
  huge elm Mr Puttler stopped to continue a story which was fated never to be
  finished.</p>

  <p>"One day the superintendent said to this man, whose name was Carter,
  'Carter,' he said, 'I can't understand&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A bullet snicked past the detective's face, struck the bole of the tree
  and sent the bark splintering. From a clump of rhododendron bushes two
  hundred yards away floated a pale blue cloud.</p>

  <p>"Down on your face!" said Dick hoarsely, and dragged the girl to the
  ground, only just in time.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The second bullet struck a little lower. A splinter of bark hummed past
  the girl's ear.</p>

  <p>"There's someone in those bushes who doesn't like me," said Mr
  Puttler.</p>

  <p>Pulling a long-barrelled Browning from his pocket, and bending low, he
  sprinted towards the bushes, zigzagging as he ran.</p>

  <p>A third shot rang out and the running man pitched forward on his face and
  lay still.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

  <p class="first">DICK flew forward to the prostrate figure, and, kneeling by
  his side, turned him on his back. His eyelids were working spasmodically, but
  there was no sign of injury, except a bruise on the side of his face which
  had been caused by his coming violently into contact with the ground. And
  then Dick saw the man's right boot. The sole had been ripped off and there
  was a patch of blood showing on the toe of the sock. At the sound of a
  rustling skirt Dick turned his head. The girl was coming towards them.</p>

  <p>"Go back behind that tree and don't move," he shouted authoritatively, but
  for once she did not obey him.</p>

  <p>She was rather pale, but there was no other evidence of fear as she knelt
  by his side and began to unfasten the collar of the stricken man.</p>

  <p>"He's stunned. I don't think it's anything worse than that," said Dick. "I
  thought at first he was finished&mdash;look at his boot!"</p>

  <p>He was pulling it off gingerly, and the operation must have hurt a little,
  because the detective winced and opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! What has happened?" he asked, looking round. "Did that bird shoot
  me?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think he's hurt you very much." Dick was looking at the foot. The
  bullet had ricocheted, cutting a shallow gash on the man's instep, but there
  was no other injury.</p>

  <p>"Do you feel fit enough to look after Miss Gine?" said Dick.</p>

  <p>The detective reached round for the gun he had dropped and humped himself
  to his feet. Without another word, Dick raced across the grassland to the
  bushes, and the girl watched him in terror, expecting every second to hear
  the fourth and the fatal shot.</p>

  <p>After five minutes he emerged from the bushes, holding something in his
  hand which he was examining curiously as he walked towards them.</p>

  <p>"A Lee-Enfield rifle, Army pattern," he said. "I found these cases."</p>

  <p>He put them into the detective's hand. Puttler examined the exploded
  cartridges carefully.</p>

  <p>"You didn't see him, of course?" he said.</p>

  <p>"No, I think he must have got round to the back of the house. The bushes
  run practically from the west wing of Fossaway Manor to the end of the Mound.
  He might, of course, be still hidden in the bushes, but the probability is
  that he made his escape as soon as he saw you fall," said Dick. "I think we'd
  better go inside and I will find you a pair of shoes, unless you have a spare
  supply."</p>

  <p>They were halfway to the house when they met Lord Chelford.</p>

  <p>"Who was that shooting?" he asked irritably. "Dick, I told you that I did
  not want rabbit shooting or any other kind of shooting within half a mile of
  the house. It gets on my nerves terribly. Really, I think, you must show a
  little more consideration."</p>

  <p>The girl had opened her lips to explain when Dick caught her eye, and with
  splendid mendacity she invented a hurried but effective excuse.</p>

  <p>"My fault, Harry. I saw a stoat, and I hate stoats." The fact that they
  had not so much as an air-gun between the three of them was unnoticed by
  Harry.</p>

  <p>"Well, of course." He was obviously taken aback by her championship. "If
  that's the case it can't be helped. Only in future, Dick, old boy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He walked rapidly back to the house.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't he be told?" asked Leslie; then, realising the foolishness
  of the question, she was all penitence. "There is no reason why he should be,
  of course. I was silly to suggest it. But, Dick, who did such a terrible
  thing? It couldn't have been an accident."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't an accident: of that I can assure you," said Mr Puttler,
  nursing his injury. "The first two shots that were fired hit the tree within
  three inches of one another. Are you going to notify the local police, Mr
  Alford?"</p>

  <p>Dick thought for a moment, then decided against that course, and to
  Leslie's surprise the detective approved.</p>

  <p>"I think you're right," said Puttler. "Where is the nearest rifle
  range?"</p>

  <p>"About fifteen miles away," said Dick sardonically. "You needn't follow
  that line of thought."</p>

  <p>"I'm not following any line of thought," said the detective. "I'm only
  foreseeing possible alibis. I spend my life standing in front of alibis and
  waving a red flag."</p>

  <p>Through the tan, Dick's face was grey. He seemed suddenly to have gone
  old, and Leslie looked at him anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Dick, at whom were they shooting?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that they were shooting at anybody," he said wearily. "They
  just loosed off a few rounds to scare us."</p>

  <p>And then he laughed; it was a fierce, hard little laugh, and she winced at
  the sound of it.</p>

  <p>"I am thinking of Harry and his nerves, and the stoat and every damned
  ridiculous&mdash;I beg your pardon, Leslie; I'm afraid I'm getting
  rattled."</p>

  <p>She smiled at this.</p>

  <p>"Dick, will you say goodbye to Harry for me? I promised my brother I would
  come home early. No, really, you need not take me. I'm not at all afraid of
  being held up by armed desperadoes!"</p>

  <p>"Neither am I," said Dick, "but I don't fancy you overmuch as a
  driver."</p>

  <p>And in her annoyance at this false accusation she forgot to resist his
  escort.</p>

  <p>By the time he had returned to the house, Puttler had secured a dressing
  for his foot. The injury was so slight that he could resume his shoes, and
  pooh-poohed the suggestion that he had better lie up that night.</p>

  <p>"It was a narrow escape," he said, "but I'm rather glad I got that bullet,
  and that it didn't go where it was intended."</p>

  <p>Dick looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"For whom was it intended?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation came the reply.</p>

  <p>"For Miss Leslie Gine: I thought you knew that."</p>

  <p>Dick could find no answer, but in his heart of hearts he knew that Puttler
  was speaking the truth.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. FABRIAN GILDER sometime head clerk to the firm of Gine
  &amp; Gine, and now a gentleman of leisure, was in one sense a hard man. He
  did not forgive even slight injuries, and in the past had gone a long way out
  of his path to get even with those who had the misfortune to affront him. And
  Arthur Gine had offended beyond hope of forgiveness. A few days before,
  Gilder would have thought it a very simple matter to be revenged upon his
  enemy; but now the simple process of laying an information and of preferring
  a charge of forgery was contingent upon four bills which were in his
  possession being repudiated by the man who was alleged to have backed
  them.</p>

  <p>He could do no more than present those interesting documents, and this he
  did through his bank. Dick had already made arrangements for their
  redemption. It was not entirely an act of philanthropy on his part, for he
  was a business man, and took over from the frankly reluctant Mr Gine the
  choice of a number of unsaleable shares which Dick regarded as having a
  certain value. The bills which had been renewed from time to time were met,
  and that ended Mr Gilder's chance of carrying his threat into execution.</p>

  <p>He was the type of man who thrived on opposition. Though it would be true
  to say that he had fallen in love with Leslie Gine the first time he had seen
  her, which was months before that unpleasant scene at his flat, his desire
  for her grew as his chance of winning her receded farther and farther into
  the background.</p>

  <p>On the night that Dick had found him examining the ruins of the abbey, Mr
  Gilder had returned to the cut road when he thought the coast was clear and
  had discovered yet another in quest of the treasure. He had witnessed the
  interview between the two men and had followed Arthur back to Willow House
  with no other intention than to offer his help, for a consideration, in
  discovering this mythical fortune. For Mr Gilder had heard quite enough, that
  day he surprised his employer with Mary Wenner, to know that somewhere under
  the abbey lay either the fortune or its key. He had overtaken Arthur on the
  drive, and Arthur was in an unpleasant mood; hot with the man at the
  interruption of his search, smarting under the sting of Dick Alford's
  sarcasm.</p>

  <p>At first, startled by the unexpected apparition of his head clerk, Arthur
  had snarled round on him, and there and then discharged him from his service
  and defied him to do his worst. It was Gilder who had struck the first
  blow.</p>

  <p>When Arthur was in his more unpleasant moods he said things that no
  self-respecting man could endure, and the black eye which the lawyer nursed
  was an advertisement of his indiscretion.</p>

  <p>Gilder might be a bookmaker, but he was not a thief. At least, "thief" was
  rather an extravagant description of his duplicity. He came back to London
  half crazy with rage, but a day in bed restored his mental equilibrium and he
  sat down to plan how best he could frustrate any plans which his late
  employer had formed for gaining possession of the treasure. By this time
  Gilder too was convinced: his last doubts were removed. He had been sceptical
  as to the treasure's existence, but he knew such things had happened, and he
  had a natural desire to be in any scheme which produced immediately and
  without great labour a vast, undreamed-of sum.</p>

  <p>His cut lip healed in a few hours, though it was still swollen, and
  towards the evening of the second day after his retirement from the firm of
  Gine &amp; Gine, he dressed himself with great care, and, calling a taxi,
  drove to an address he had once scribbled on his white shirt-cuff.</p>

  <p>Mary Wenner occupied a tiny flat, every compartment of which might have
  been contained in one large-sized room. It was perched on the top floor of a
  block near Baker Street. She enjoyed an uninterrupted view of the
  Metropolitan Railway and such shunting operations as are carried out in that
  busy centre, and she was as a rule free from callers; for there were no
  elevators in the block, and to climb up four steep flights of stairs was
  something of an undertaking.</p>

  <p>Mr Gilder was not strong for physical exertion and cursed the parsimonious
  builder who had neglected to put in this easy method of transportation.
  Nevertheless he climbed, and presently was ringing at the polished bell of
  No. 37.</p>

  <p>Mary had a daily servant, who was a charwoman in the morning, a
  parlourmaid in the afternoon and her own natural self after six, at which
  hour she left for the night. This aged woman, with her dingy white cap askew,
  opened the door and took the card in to her mistress, leaving Mr Gilder on
  the mat. She came back with an ingratiating smile, and pointed to the room
  where Mary was to be found.</p>

  <p>"This is an unexpected pleasure, Mr Gilder," said Miss Wenner
  conventionally. "I'm sure I never thought that you would be as good as your
  word. Sit down, won't you?"</p>

  <p>She really was pretty, he observed; in her plain house dress she was
  prettier than in a more elaborate attire. The flat, though small, was well
  but not expensively furnished. It left him with the impression that she had
  bought everything with her own money, and he had rather a nice feeling
  towards her in consequence. For Fabrian Gilder was a queer mixture of Puritan
  and adventurer. Later, Mary had her flat to thank for certain pleasant
  developments.</p>

  <p>There was only one chair on which be could sit, and this he took.</p>

  <p>"You'd like a cup of tea? I'm just going to have mine," said Miss Wenner.
  "I've been out all day shopping and everything."</p>

  <p>"Are you&mdash;er&mdash;working?" asked Gilder delicately.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not in business," replied Miss Wenner, more correctly. "Only
  common people 'work': the gentility "go to business."</p>

  <p>She went out, disappearing in a mysterious cupboard, which had just enough
  room for a tiny kitchen table and a gas-stove, and he heard the rattle of cup
  against saucer, the "plomp!" of a gas ring being lighted, and after a while
  she came back, a little flushed and apologetic.</p>

  <p>"Maids are so stupid, aren't they?" she asked. "You can never trust these
  common daily people. I had an awfully nice maid, but she went away and got
  married, the stupid child!"</p>

  <p>She received very few visitors, she told him. Her "sewing woman" came
  twice a week. She had a very dear friend&mdash;a girl, she hastened to assure
  him &mdash; who spent Tuesday evenings with her and sometimes slept in the
  flat. But a male visitor was the rarest of phenomena.</p>

  <p>"You can't be too careful," said Miss Wenner primly. "A girl's character
  is her principal asset&mdash;don't you agree, Mr Gilder?"</p>

  <p>Mr Gilder agreed.</p>

  <p>"That is what I have always said about my work with Harry&mdash;excuse me,
  I mean Lord Chelford, only we were such awfully good friends that I've never
  dreamt of calling him by anything but his Christian name."</p>

  <p>"And did you call Richard Alford by his Christian name?" asked Mr Gilder,
  not without malice.</p>

  <p>Her nose went up in the air.</p>

  <p>"Him!" she said contemptuously. "I don't take any more notice of him than
  I do of any of the other upper servants! He's educated and all
  that&mdash;went to Eton and Harrow" (even Mr Gilder winced at this), "but you
  judge a man by his manners and not by his education. There's no doubt at all
  that Dick Alford has the manners of a pig!"</p>

  <p>She said this with feeling and no little vehemence. Mr Gilder, who knew
  something of the circumstances, understood and almost sympathised.</p>

  <p>"I was going to say that down at Fossaway I often felt that it wasn't
  right to be in that big house with no lady there except the housekeeper, who,
  of course, is a servant, and&mdash;Oh! here you are, Gladys!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">SHE rose as Gladys brought in the tea-tray and laid it
  carefully on the table. Gladys was sixty, toothless and more or less
  chinless. She wore most of her hair in a bun, which overflowed, drooping over
  her neck in picturesque confusion. Gladys had the smile of one who enjoyed
  the privilege of entertaining a visitor. She smiled at the girl, smiled at Mr
  Gilder and smiled herself out of the room. Fabrian Gilder thought he had
  never seen a more ghastly exhibition.</p>

  <p>"You're a good friend of Gine's, aren't you?" he asked, as he sipped his
  tea.</p>

  <p>She dropped her eyes in maidenly embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"We are rather good friends, but no more. We may be something closer
  &mdash; who knows? He has always behaved like a perfect gentleman and treated
  me like a lady. I must say that for Arthur. But he's a little trying; don't
  you find him so?" she asked, with a girlish naïveté that was a little
  overdone.</p>

  <p>"I have left him," said Mr Gilder briefly. "He and I disagreed over a
  question of policy and I retired. In fact, we had a very bad row and came to
  blows&mdash;I tell you this because you'll probably learn the facts from him
  sooner or later."</p>

  <p>Mary was shocked; and when Mary was shocked she covered her rather
  generous mouth with her two small, white hands.</p>

  <p>"You don't tell me!" she said in a hushed voice. "Blows! Is that it?" She
  nodded her head to his lip.</p>

  <p>"That's it," said Gilder shortly.</p>

  <p>"Blows!" repeated Mary Wenner. "How perfectly disgusting and vulgar!"</p>

  <p>"I wanted to talk to you about Arthur Gine," Gilder broke in upon her
  horrified wonder. "We're not good friends, but that doesn't mean I bear him
  any malice. But naturally, as we are parted, I don't feel called upon to
  protect him and stand between him and his dupes"&mdash;he emphasised the last
  word&mdash;"as I have done in the past. You know him as well as I do," he
  went on, as she was about to speak. "You know his vanity; you know how
  perfectly unreliable and insincere he is; you know too that he'd get out of
  any promise he ever made, even if it was in black and white."</p>

  <p>He was watching her narrowly all the time he spoke, and now he saw her
  eyebrows arch.</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" she said coldly. "I don't know anything about the law, but I
  can't see how a gentleman, or a common man for the matter of that, could get
  out of&mdash;what is the expression&mdash;legal obligations?"</p>

  <p>"Then you don't know Arthur Gine as well as I do," he said. "But that is
  beside the point. I haven't come here to blackguard him or to make him look
  smaller in your eyes. Not that I could," he said, anticipating her protest a
  little ambiguously. "But I believe in a girl having a square deal, especially
  a working girl who may have nobody in the world to look after her interests.
  And I tell you that that fellow couldn't go straight if he was fired from a
  gun. Now what about the Chelford treasure?"</p>

  <p>At the words she sat bolt upright, and a look of blank astonishment came
  to her face.</p>

  <p>"Do you know?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Of course I know! You're going to help him find the gold, and in
  return&mdash;" He paused.</p>

  <p>That was exactly what he had come to find out. What obligation had Arthur
  undertaken in return for the information she would give him? And he was
  pretty sure of his ground. He knew the girl; had had some dealings with her
  when she was with Chelford; and since he lived on his knowledge of human
  beings, he had analysed her with more or less accuracy. He knew her vanity,
  her ambition; had heard something of her summary discharge from Fossaway
  Manor. There was only one reward that Arthur Gine could offer.</p>

  <p>"He has promised to marry you," he said, and he was not altogether drawing
  a bow at a venture.</p>

  <p>"Did he tell you that?" she said, with a little catch in her voice. "I
  hope you don't think, Mr Gilder, that I've thrown myself at his head? That I
  wouldn't do for the best man in the world." She looked at him thoughtfully,
  and added: "Old or young. I trust Arthur as a gentleman to fulfil any promise
  he has made. I am going to do something for him that will make all the
  difference in the world&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"When is he going to marry you? After the treasure is discovered, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"He will have to marry me then," she said.</p>

  <p>"I realise that. You're a girl that has to make her way in the world
  without influence, and possibly without friends." Mr Gilder knew he was on
  the right tack here. "He can offer you a position and you can offer him
  money. After all, that is exactly what his sister is doing, and nobody thinks
  any worse of her for that."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," murmured Miss Wenner, who had never seen the matter in that
  light before.</p>

  <p>"The point I want to make is this," he went on. "What bond has he given
  you?"</p>

  <p>"His word of honour," said Miss Wenner dramatically.</p>

  <p>"I daresay. But what valuable bond has he given you?"</p>

  <p>"I'll show you."</p>

  <p>She went into the next room, which was evidently her bedroom, and,
  returning with her bag, placed it on her knee, opened the flap and took out,
  amongst other things, a slip of paper, which she passed across to Mr Gilder.
  He read it at a glance, noted the careful emendation which Arthur had made,
  and passed it back.</p>

  <p>"That is valueless," he said, and her face fell. "What is to prevent his
  going to Chelford and striking a bargain with him? Where do you come in then?
  Besides, this is what is known in law as a promise under duress&mdash;that is
  to say, under compulsion. If he is acting in the interests of his client, he
  can plead that he had to make this promise in order to secure information
  which you were illegally withholding."</p>

  <p>She stared at him.</p>

  <p>"It's not illegal to know and not to tell?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"To know of the existence of hidden treasure and to withhold your
  information is a crime in some countries, and I daresay it is in England. But
  that's beside the point. Where do you come in, Miss Wenner?"</p>

  <p>She bit her lip thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I never saw it in that way," she confessed. "What can I do, Mr
  Gilder?"</p>

  <p>"Get him to marry you first." He felt inclined to offer the obvious
  solution, but changed his mind. Mary Wenner married would be a useless
  ally.</p>

  <p>At the back of his mind he was certain that this rather vulgar girl
  &mdash; for he had a nice and finicking taste in the matter of
  women&mdash;had discovered the Chelford millions. If he had not had this
  belief he would not have made his call. He believed that by some accident, or
  by reason of her close association with Harry Alford, she had unveiled the
  mystery of the lost gold; and his object now was to discover how far his
  theory was justified by facts.</p>

  <p>"Is there no way of making that agreement more binding, Mr Gilder?" she
  asked. "You're a lawyer&mdash;couldn't you draw up something he wouldn't
  wriggle out of? Naturally, I'm too much of a lady to want any man to marry me
  if he doesn't want to marry me. If he just hinted as much I should tell him
  to go&mdash;I should simply say, 'Oh, very well, I'm not at all anxious to
  marry, thank you very much.' I think a girl who throws herself at a man's
  head is despicable, don't you, Mr Gilder?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer this query.</p>

  <p>"I could draw you up an agreement that would be legally binding, but I
  doubt if even that would help you. Why trust him at all?" he asked
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>She dropped her eyes at this.</p>

  <p>"Who, or whom, could I trust?" she asked, and took an invisible crumb off
  her dress. "This is such an awful world, and men are so very deceitful, Mr
  Gilder. The young ones are the worst, of course, but they haven't experience.
  I do think that a man isn't in the prime of life till he's about forty-five."
  She waited. "Or fifty. He's sort of settled down and sowed his wild oats, and
  he doesn't want to go out at nights and all that. And I'll admit that Arthur
  is flighty. I wouldn't tell it to anybody but you, but he tried to kiss me
  any number of times, and he once said the most terrible thing to me at
  Fossaway Manor. I said to him: 'Arthur, you seem to forget that you're
  speaking to a lady,' and he just curled up and died, if you understand me. I
  don't mean that he actually perished&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I understand what you mean," said Gilder, and went on to make his most
  startling revelation. "Now listen, Miss Wenner. You're a sensible girl and I
  can talk to you as I could talk to very few people."</p>

  <p>This cliché of intensive flattery, which so seldom fails even when
  employed upon intelligent people, produced in Miss Wenner the strained
  attentiveness which was called for.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I tell you," said Fabrian Gilder darkly, "that Gine is already
  trying to anticipate your discovery?"</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon?" Mary Wenner was not very strong on the more flowery
  expressions of speech.</p>

  <p>"Suppose he's trying to get ahead of you&mdash;trying to find the gold
  without your assistance?"</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't dare!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>Mr Gilder nodded very slowly, very deliberately.</p>

  <p>"He has already tried," he said. "Two nights ago I was watching him,
  suspecting his plan. He went at three o'clock in the morning to the ruins of
  Chelford Abbey, and he took with him a crowbar&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Whilst he was speaking, the red in her face deepened and the wide-opened
  eyes grew brighter.</p>

  <p>"The hound!" she breathed. "The twisting, double-faced monkey!"</p>

  <p>It was not a ladylike expression, but for the moment she was superior to
  sham.</p>

  <p>"The dirty, thieving, twisting sneak! To the abbey, with a crowbar? I'll
  take my oath on a Bible that I never breathed a word of where it was hid
  &mdash; I mean hidden. Let him go with his crowbar&mdash;ha, ha!" She laughed
  shrilly, but gave no other evidence of supreme amusement. "I'll crowbar him!
  Let him search and scrape and dig and see what he can find."</p>

  <p>He tried to soothe her, but for the moment her soul was breaking in
  tumultuous waves upon the muddy flats of Arthur's duplicity.</p>

  <p>"He has deceived me! I don't mean in an unladylike way&mdash;I
  mean&mdash;you know what I mean, Mr Gilder? I trusted that man. I gave him
  all my heart." The sob came naturally, but it was largely due to intensified
  annoyance. "I gave him all that a woman could give a man&mdash;information I
  mean, Mr Gilder&mdash;I don't want you to get any wrong ideas about me,
  because I've always behaved like a lady, and nobody can point their fingers
  of scorn at me."</p>

  <p>She grew calm after a while.</p>

  <p>"Who can you trust?" she asked bitterly.
  "Who&mdash;can&mdash;you&mdash;trust?"</p>

  <p>"You can trust me." Fabrian Gilder's voice was very gentle, almost
  pleading.</p>

  <p>He was rather a good-looking man, she observed; his grey hair gave him
  distinction.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't want a legal document from me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I would," she said obstinately. "I don't trust men."</p>

  <p>"You shall have any document you wish. I will even go as far as
  compromising myself hopelessly."</p>

  <p>She coughed.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I should go quite as far as that," she said,
  misunderstanding him.</p>

  <p>"I mean that I would take the risk of detection, without safeguarding
  myself as Arthur Gine has done."</p>

  <p>She dabbed her eyes with her pocket-handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Of course, Mr Gilder, I don't know you very well, but I'm not going to
  say that I don't like you. I've always said to Agatha&mdash;my Tuesday
  friend, as I call her&mdash;'Mr Gilder's a perfect gentleman.' In fact,
  I'm&mdash;Mr Gilder, what is your Christian name?"</p>

  <p>"Fabrian," he said.</p>

  <p>She lingered tenderly over the word and smiled, a wistful sideways
  smile.</p>

  <p>"I should call you Fabe, I suppose? It's a perfectly lovely name. As I was
  saying, I don't want to throw myself at any man's head."</p>

  <p>"Let us go down tonight."</p>

  <p>Her face changed.</p>

  <p>"To the abbey&mdash;tonight?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"My car will get us down in an hour and a half, and we can wait till it's
  dark; and unless there's a lot of digging to be done&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no digging," she said. "But tonight?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he demanded. "My cottage is less than a mile from the abbey. If
  the gold is there and reachable, we could get away with enough to make us
  rich for life."</p>

  <p>She pondered this, and then:</p>

  <p>"I know you'll think it horrid of me, Mr Gilder&mdash;Fabe&mdash;that does
  sound familiar, doesn't it?&mdash;but I would like something in black and
  white."</p>

  <p>There and then Mr Fabrian Gilder produced a document that was enough, as
  he observed jocularly, to hang him, and, reading it, even Mary Wenner, with
  her keen instinct for safeguards, was impressed. He wrote the agreement with
  his own fountain pen, on paper which he provided, and he had brought along
  that pen in his pocket with a view to such a contingency. It was a new pen,
  filled with an ink that he had purchased at a novelty store in Wardour
  Street, and which was guaranteed to fade within six hours of writing.</p>

  <p>Miss Wenner read it through, folded it and put it into her bag, and
  disappeared into her bedroom. She came back with the bag, but he guessed that
  the agreement was disposed in some safe place.</p>

  <p>"Now, Fabe, what time do you want to start?"</p>

  <p>"At nine-thirty?" he suggested, and she nodded.</p>

  <p>"And don't trouble to bring a crowbar," she said a little viciously, as
  she remembered Arthur Gine's rank treachery. "I'll carry all the tools we
  want in my bag."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

  <p class="first">THE weather had changed that afternoon. Big black clouds had
  come up from the west; a steady drizzle of rain had set in when Fabrian
  Gilder brought his car to the rendezvous in Marylebone Road. He had pulled up
  the hood, and, as a matter of precaution, he had cleared out every portable
  thing from the tonneau. If there was gold he must find room for it, and he
  made a careful calculation as to the weight he could carry on each
  journey.</p>

  <p>He was surprised at himself that he had accepted as a fact so readily that
  there was gold to be taken. From the girl he learned for the first time the
  extent of the treasure. He had inquired casually of his garage man the amount
  of strain the back axle would stand. That was unnecessary, for he had once
  driven four fairly heavy men a considerable journey. Supposing they weighed
  170 pounds, that would be the equivalent of twenty bars of gold.</p>

  <p>It was nearly ten before the girl appeared. She was wearing a long
  raincoat and stepped into the seat by his side with a voluble apology.</p>

  <p>"I nearly didn't come," she said. "I only just remembered after you'd gone
  that awful Black Abbot."</p>

  <p>He was a little amused.</p>

  <p>"You don't believe in that kind of hokum, do you?" he asked, as the car
  went swiftly down Baker Street.</p>

  <p>"I don't know." She was dubious. "He did appear once or twice when I was
  at the Manor, but we used to believe that these were villagers' stories.
  According to the newspapers they've seen more of him lately&mdash;ugh!" She
  shivered.</p>

  <p>He tapped his pocket significantly with his hand.</p>

  <p>"I've got something here that's mighty bad for abbots black or white!" he
  said. "Don't you worry, little girl."</p>

  <p>"No, Fabe," she said meekly.</p>

  <p>Very delicately he suggested that she might call him by the Christian name
  his parents had given him. There was no diminutive, he explained, and excused
  his correction by telling her that there was a possibility that she might
  address him and he would not know to whom she was speaking.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe in long engagements, do you?" she went off at a
  tangent.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't. They should be short&mdash;and sweet!"</p>

  <p>They both laughed together, and were in excellent humour by the time they
  reached the deserted streets of Dorking.</p>

  <p>"I only have one anxiety," he told her. "Mr Richard Alford has got a habit
  of prowling round at odd hours. On a night like this he'll hardly leave his
  comfortable apartment."</p>

  <p>"Comfortable apartment!" she scoffed. "Why, he's only got a tiny little
  office, and his bedroom's not much bigger than mine. I simply detest the man.
  He gives himself more airs in a day than dear Harry gives himself in ten
  years&mdash;you don't mind me saying dear Harry? You're not jealous, are
  you?"</p>

  <p>He assured her he was not at all jealous.</p>

  <p>"I should have married Harry if it hadn't been for him. Harry was simply
  crazy about me, but Dick hated me&mdash;how that man hated me! Mind you, I've
  always snubbed him when he got a little too fresh. I don't say that he was
  chasing me&mdash;I hate girls who think every man is after them&mdash;but he
  was certainly very attentive once or twice. After lunch or dinner he'd get up
  and open the door for me, and that's a thing that Harry never did. But of
  course I saw through it. It was all deceit and artfulness."</p>

  <p>She chattered at rare intervals, except during the five miles of driving
  rain that forced its way under the cover and lashed her face.</p>

  <p>"It's a horrible night," she complained.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, it's one of the best nights I could have chosen even if
  I had the ordering of the weather," said Mr Gilder.</p>

  <p>When they reached the secondary road that led to Chelfordbury he proceeded
  with greater caution, extinguishing the flaming head-lamps and relying upon
  the two small lights that were placed on the front mudguard. He knew the road
  so well that there was no danger of mishap; his chief anxiety was that he
  should not, by the reflected rays of the bigger headlights, be
  recognised.</p>

  <p>A mile from Fossaway Manor he switched out the remaining two lights, for
  he had a shrewd idea that this section of the road was visible from Lord
  Chelford's house. To the nervous girl riding at his side, it seemed that they
  were in imminent danger every minute of colliding with one of the telegraph
  posts which ran along the side of the road. Happily she was not aware that
  the smaller lamps had been extinguished.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry," he assured her. "I know every inch of this road; I've
  driven up it a hundred times. My cottage lies just beyond Willow House."</p>

  <p>The car, which had been moving silently and smoothly, began to slow as it
  went up the hill that led to Fontwell Cutting. He switched off the engine,
  and, jamming on the brakes, got out and opened the gate into Red Farm field.
  Then, walking alongside the car, he released the brakes and guided it to the
  place where Dick had found the machine a few nights before.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," he said.</p>

  <p>He took her arm; she was shivering, and when she spoke he heard the
  chatter of her teeth.</p>

  <p>"I wish I hadn't come," she said, started, and pointed into the dark.
  "What is that over there?" she whispered fearfully.</p>

  <p>"A pollard willow," he said. "Really there's nothing to be afraid of
  &mdash; Mary."</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that," she quavered. "Don't let go of my arm, will
  you? Have you got a pistol?"</p>

  <p>He assured her that he had.</p>

  <p>Through the little gate, which he knew was unlocked, up the steep and
  slippery slope, and immediately ahead of them in the darkness were the solemn
  ruins.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather not show a light," he said in a low voice. "That was how Gine
  was discovered. Do you know your way?"</p>

  <p>"If I can see the tower," she suggested.</p>

  <p>Stooping down to get an artificial skyline, he saw the bulk of the ruined
  tower and guided her forward. Once she stumbled over a heap of stones, and
  would have screamed if his hand had not covered her mouth.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake be careful!" he urged. "Now how do we get to the
  vault?"</p>

  <p>"Wait." She released his arm and went towards the wall of the tower. He
  saw her once more, when she was groping her way round. Presently she
  whispered: "Come along."</p>

  <p>He followed her, and reaching out her hand she took his.</p>

  <p>"There's a step down," she whispered.</p>

  <p>They were going into the tower, although he did not remember having seen
  any opening. He heard a rusty squeak.</p>

  <p>"It's very narrow; you'll have to squeeze through."</p>

  <p>The opening, he judged, was about a foot wide, and he had some trouble to
  pass the obstacle.</p>

  <p>"It's a big corner stone," she said, in a low voice. "It swings round and
  opens like a door. It's the way the old Abbot used to go out when he carried
  on with Lady Chelford&mdash;you've heard that bit of scandal, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>The "bit of scandal" was some eight hundred years old and was news to
  him.</p>

  <p>"If you've got a lamp you can put it on."</p>

  <p>He pulled out his torch and turned the switch. They were in a tiny stone
  chamber at the top of a circular flight of moss-grown stairs. Above was a
  vaulted roof, which seemed to be cut out of one piece of stone, as it might
  well be, for the interior measurements of the tower could not have been much
  more than four by five. The thickness of the walls he could judge; they had
  been built in the days when walls had other functions than to support a
  roof.</p>

  <p>"Come along." She led the way, stepping gingerly on the slithery moss.</p>

  <p>He counted twenty-five steps, and then they were in a large stone chamber,
  so weather-worn that it seemed to be a natural cave. Walls and roof had lost
  their symmetry, and only the square of it told him that it was the work of
  man's hands.</p>

  <p>"Have you got the key?"</p>

  <p>He nodded. Many years before, Gine &amp; Gine had defended a famous
  burglar and had secured his acquittal on a technical error in the indictment.
  In reward he had presented to his lawyer a key which he claimed would open
  any door, big or small. It was a curious contrivance, consisting of a steel
  rod into the end of which strangely shaped projections could be screwed.
  Arthur had given it to his head clerk as a souvenir, having no interest in
  such matters himself, and rather scandalised that the firm was engaged in so
  discreditable a business as defending a burglar. This souvenir had now become
  an instrument of providence.</p>

  <p>"Here is the place." She still spoke in a whisper, though it was hardly
  likely they could be overheard.</p>

  <p>In each corner of the room, facing them as they turned from the foot of
  the stairs, was a small, narrow door, deeply recessed. They reminded Mr
  Gilder of the cell doors in Dartmoor, and there was a further likeness in
  another respect. Near the top of the left-hand door was a tiny iron grille,
  consisting of three rusted bars.</p>

  <p>"Look!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>He flashed the light of the lamp inside, where a deep, narrow cavern
  showed, along two sides of which ran a stone bench, and on the bench were
  innumerable cylinders of significant shape. He inspected the nearest; there
  was a curious seal at one end.</p>

  <p>Fabrian Gilder's heart beat faster. The girl's hand that held his arm
  tightly was trembling.</p>

  <p>"I'm so frightened," she whimpered.</p>

  <p>"What are you frightened about?"</p>

  <p>"I'm so afraid of that awful Black Abbot." She was on the verge of
  hysterical breakdown. He must work quickly.</p>

  <p>He was fitting one of the accessories to the rod, and he pushed it in the
  big keyhole and turned. There was a grind and a click, but when he pulled the
  door it was fast. Again he tried, fitting another steel accessory, and on the
  third attempt the key turned with a horrible squeak, and he pulled the door
  open.</p>

  <p>As he did so, the girl gripped his arm frenziedly.</p>

  <p>"Look! Oh, my God! Look!" she screamed, and he turned.</p>

  <p>Standing at the foot of the stairs was a figure in black, his face hidden
  under a long cowl. Two eyes they saw, gleaming feverishly upon them.
  Terrible, menacing, the Black Abbot was coldly surveying them!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

  <p class="first">WITH an oath, Gilder whipped a pistol from his pocket, but
  in doing so the beam of his lamp fell for a second. When he brought it up
  again, pistol extended, the figure had vanished.</p>

  <p>"Don't go, don't go!" she shrieked, gripping his arm. "Oh, Mr Gilder! Oh,
  Fabrian, don't leave me!"</p>

  <p>He thrust her aside and ran to the foot of the winding stairs and went
  cautiously up. He heard the sobbing breath of the girl coming behind him.</p>

  <p>"Don't leave me! Don't leave me in the dark!" she sobbed.</p>

  <p>Higher, higher, cautious, watchful, but no sign of a black habit. The
  little room above was as they had left it; the tiny slit of a door was
  open.</p>

  <p>Brushing past him, the girl stumbled and staggered into the open air and
  collapsed on to her knees.</p>

  <p>"Take me away! Take me away!" she raved. "I wish I had never come!"</p>

  <p>Gilder turned with a curse and swung the stone door closed, then, half-
  carrying, half-dragging her, beside himself with fury, in which was mingled
  no little fear, he brought her to the road and to the car.</p>

  <p>The rain was pouring down. He pushed back the hood of the car savagely, so
  that the full force of the storm should beat upon her&mdash;he dare not allow
  himself to be burdened with a fainting girl. He would take her back to her
  flat and leave her&mdash;there would be plenty of time for him to return and
  investigate those cylinders.</p>

  <p>As for the Black Abbot&mdash;He breathed a little more quickly when he
  thought of that terrifying appearance. Whoever it was&mdash;and that it was
  human he did not doubt&mdash;they would live to regret their interference. By
  the time they reached Horsham, the girl, drenched to the skin, cold and
  shivering, had got back a little of her balance. Her teeth were chattering,
  but not with fear. She was inclined to be garrulous, but he answered in
  monosyllables or not at all.</p>

  <p>"I wonder I didn't die," she said. "I've never seen anything so perfectly
  horribly ghastly! Did you see the way his eyes glared? They looked as if they
  were alight, didn't they, Fabe?"</p>

  <p>"Fabrian," he snapped.</p>

  <p>"I never saw anything like it, not even in the pictures," said Miss
  Wenner. "Couldn't we have the hood up, Fabe&mdash;Fabrian?"</p>

  <p>He stopped the car with a jerk, pulled up the hood and fastened it.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I'm taking you home. We'll make another attempt tomorrow night. By the
  way, how did you get that stone corner piece to turn?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you that, Fabrian," she said firmly and truly. "That's my
  only hold over you."</p>

  <p>"Don't be stupid. You used a bodkin or something, didn't you? I noticed
  there was a space between two stones which looked to be artificial."</p>

  <p>"A pair of scissors," she said. "There's an iron catch inside that
  slit&mdash;I only found it by accident."</p>

  <p>He knew all he wanted to know now; could dispense with her for the rest of
  the night, forever, as it happened. He declined her invitation to come
  upstairs for a drink and no sooner was she out of sight than he was flying
  back into Sussex.</p>

  <p>Halfway between Dorking and Leatherhead, his petrol gave out, and he had
  to wait on the charity of a passing motorist, and it was not a night when
  traffic was very thick. At last he found a Good Samaritan who gave him enough
  to take the machine to the nearest filling station, and at Dorking, with his
  tank replenished and a few extra tins against emergency, he went on
  confidently.</p>

  <p>Two o'clock showed on the illuminated dial of his watch when he backed the
  car into the field and mounted the slope to the ruins. From here onward he
  moved noiselessly, one step at a time, stopping every few paces to listen.
  But there was no sign or sound of the masked man.</p>

  <p>He found the corner of the tower, with his penknife pressed back the
  catch, and, pulling at the rough stone, the edges of which crumbled in his
  hand, he opened the door.</p>

  <p>Stopping only to examine the upper chamber, he went slowly down the
  stairs, his pistol in one hand, his lamp in the other. There was no sign of
  the intruder, but&mdash;</p>

  <p>The door of the treasure-house was closed. He pulled, and it swung open.
  Flashing his lamp into the long, narrow cell, he saw something that sent the
  blood from his face. The "ingots" had disappeared, every one of them! Neither
  the bench to the left nor right held a single cylinder. Beads of perspiration
  were running down his face as he turned, and it would have been death to any
  human spook who opposed him, for his heart was bitter against whoever it was
  had checked his enterprise.</p>

  <p>He made another inspection of the underground chamber. Unlike its fellow,
  the second door in the opposite corner of the room was solid. Neither
  peep-hole nor grating gave a view into the room it guarded. He guessed that
  behind the nail-studded portal was a similar room to that in which the
  cylinders had been stored. Trying his key on the lock, he could produce no
  result. He put his shoulder to the oaken face, but the door did not budge by
  so much as a fraction of an inch.</p>

  <p>Before this room the flooring consisted of a long slab of stone that ran
  without a break to the centre of the apartment, and was the exact width of
  the narrow doorway. Had this any significance? Kneeling, he examined the
  stone carefully. It was different from the rest of the paving. The broken
  stones that formed the floor of the room were worn smooth by the passage of
  generations of men; this oblong strip was rough-dressed, more like the
  underside of a paving-stone than its chiselled surface. He stamped on one
  end and felt it give ever so slightly; stamped on the other end and had a
  like experience. In the middle ran a staple, balancing the stone, and beneath
  there was a hollow space. Some day or night he would come along and conduct a
  more careful inspection.</p>

  <p>He came into the upper room to confront a more urgent problem. Just as he
  was about to extinguish his lamp preparatory to passing through the opening,
  he saw the stone move. Before he could spring forward it had thudded into its
  place. From somewhere outside he heard an unearthly chuckle of laughter.</p>

  <p>Trapped! He pushed at the door, but it was inflexible. Inch by inch he
  examined its surface. There must be an opening somewhere, he thought. He
  remembered the story of the amorous Abbot and his clandestine excursions. It
  was certain that a means existed for opening the door from the inside.</p>

  <p>He searched the wall; nothing appeared. And then it occurred to him to
  send his light slowly along the floor, which was made up of broken
  flagstones. One, smaller than the others, attracted his attention, because it
  lay at a truer level than the rest, and he tugged at its end, and, with great
  effort, pulled it up. Beneath he saw a great iron ring, so rusted that it was
  almost razor-thin. With his handkerchief he gripped it and pulled. It gave a
  little, and, as it did so, he saw the door move. Again he strained at the
  handle, and slowly it came up; although the door had moved only an inch he
  knew it was clear of the invisible catch which held it. Running to the stone,
  he pressed with all his might. It swung open and he came staggering out into
  the eerie light of dawn.</p>

  <p>The storm had passed; overhead, the stars were shining in the paling sky.
  Far away to his left a wisp of smoke curled up from the twisted chimneys of
  Fossaway Manor. Fabrian Gilder wiped his hot face and strove to overcome the
  bitterness of his defeat. And then, at his feet, he saw something and,
  stooping with a cry, picked it up. It was one of the cylinders, heavy and
  laden, that had been dropped by those who had cleared the vault. It was not
  heavy enough for gold. He knew that at once. The cover was of lead. He tore
  away the seal, expecting to find an opening, but the cylinder had been sealed
  at both ends. He carried it quickly down the slope, and in the shelter of the
  cut road he took out his knife and slit the thin lead end, and pulled out a
  tightly rolled sheet of parchment. He opened it and stared. It was an ancient
  missal, beautifully painted and, as a work of art, priceless, but a poor
  substitute for thirty-five pounds weight of solid gold!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

  <p class="first">AND that was all the other cylinders contained, he thought,
  with a gleam of satisfaction. Whoever had watched him&mdash;and he suspected
  Arthur Gine naturally&mdash;had had the same disappointment.</p>

  <p>It was in this room that the old monks had stored their ancient music;
  there was a certain grim humour in the thought of how he had spent his night
  and the reward for it.</p>

  <p>He crossed the road, opened the gate and went into the field where he had
  left his car, and stood stockstill, petrified with amazement. The car had
  disappeared!</p>

  <p>The tracks were plainly visible. They led through the cutting, along the
  road towards Willow House. There was nothing to do but to tramp after them. A
  mile beyond Arthur Gine's residence was Ravensrill Cottage, his own property,
  he thought with some satisfaction, and a snug retreat where a man could get a
  hot bath in an hour and a steaming cup of tea in a quarter. The prospect was
  cheering, for he was wet through, weary and footsore.</p>

  <p>The tracks passed the entrance of Willow House and continued on the way to
  the cottage; and when at last he turned the bend of the road that brought his
  little country home into view, he saw the car standing before the door. There
  was no sign of any living creature. He went round the house, searched the
  tiny plantation to the left, and even descended to the banks of the stream,
  before he opened the door of his cottage and went in.</p>

  <p>He put the key in the lock and, to his surprise, on the pressure of his
  hand, the door opened. The door which opened into his little dining-room
  yielded to his pressure before he could turn the key. He gazed, stricken dumb
  with amazement. A small fire was burning in the grate, on which a kettle was
  steaming. An open teapot was on the hearth, and somebody had broken open a
  tin of biscuits. He heard a footstep in the next room and swung round to meet
  the intruder; and at the sight of him he dropped the point of his levelled
  Browning.</p>

  <p>"Thomas!" he said, unable to believe his eyes. "What the devil are you
  doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Fired this morning," said the ex-footman curtly.</p>

  <p>"This morning? Why, it's hardly daylight!"</p>

  <p>Thomas nodded.</p>

  <p>"Alford found me wandering about the house when I ought to have been in
  bed and asleep," he said, "and he hoofed me out."</p>

  <p>"But why?"</p>

  <p>The man was uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"How do I know why?" he demanded. "That dog never liked me. I think he
  suspected me of writing to you."</p>

  <p>Gilder knew that this story was a lie, designed to show him under an
  obligation to this ex-servant. Thomas had been a useful correspondent of his:
  all that went on at Fossaway Manor had been faithfully recorded for his
  information.</p>

  <p>"You are in trouble. What have you been doing?"</p>

  <p>The man pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>"Well," he hesitated, "I may as well tell you the truth. Have you ever
  heard of Monkey Puttler? Wait a minute, I'll make the tea."</p>

  <p>He picked up the steaming kettle and filled the pot, and not till he had
  put it back on the hob did he continue his narrative.</p>

  <p>"Monkey Puttler's a 'busy.' Every crook in London knows him, and I know
  him as well as anybody because he got me three years for a job I did at the
  Westinghouse Hotel."</p>

  <p>"Burglary?" asked the other, to whom this was news.</p>

  <p>"An inside job," said
  Thomas tersely. "You can call it burglary if it gives you any pleasure.
  Anyway, Monkey caught me and pushed me over the Alps for three long and weary
  ones. When I came out I got this job. There were pickings to it too. Chelford
  isn't a man who counts his change, and Alford doesn't dare ask him what he's
  done with his money when he comes for more."</p>

  <p>"An ex-convict, eh?" Gilder was slightly shocked and regarded the man from
  a new angle. "I didn't know that or I should never have employed you!"</p>

  <p>"I had to kid a bit," confessed Thomas, with a grin. "You kidded me all
  right!" replied Gilder. "Well, I didn't exactly kid you," said the other,
  amused. "But that day when I went to your office and you started cross-
  examining me about how things were at the Manor with Gine, I didn't see why I
  shouldn't earn a few honest dollars."</p>

  <p>"Well? Go on about your friend Monkey&mdash;what is his name?"</p>

  <p>"Puttler. He came yesterday."</p>

  <p>"To Chelford's house?" asked Gilder in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes," nodded Thomas. "Alford pretended he is an accountant, but he's a
  busy all right; I knew him the moment I saw him, and, what's worse, he knew
  me. I'd come to Chelford's service on a false character and I knew my number
  was up as soon as I saw his ugly phiz. Sure enough, last night Alford gave me
  notice, told me to clear out today. I'll catch that bird one of these days,"
  he said, with an ugly look in his face.</p>

  <p>"But why this morning?" asked Gilder.</p>

  <p>"I was going to tell you," said the other impatiently. "Chelford keeps a
  cash-box in his library; it's in the second left-hand drawer, and he's
  generally got a wad of stuff there. He's childish in the matter of money. I
  knew if I could get my hooks into the stuff I could lift enough to be happy,
  and leave enough behind so that Chelford couldn't swear whether I'd had it or
  not. I got into the library about four this morning, and was going upstairs
  when Alford spotted me, told me to go up and dress and clear, which I did.
  He's got something on his mind, that fellow, he never sleeps!"</p>

  <p>"He caught you with the money?" asked Gilder in disgust.</p>

  <p>"Not he&mdash;I shoved that out of the library window as soon as I got it.
  I picked it up later."</p>

  <p>"What was Mr Alford doing, wandering about the house at that hour?"</p>

  <p>The man made a grimace.</p>

  <p>"You never know when that bird is around," he said. "He's not human; I
  tell you he doesn't want sleep!"</p>

  <p>Though Gilder was certain he was telling the truth, yet he was equally
  sure that the man was concealing something. There seemed to him to be gaps in
  his story, which he bridged readily enough. Wisely he decided that it was not
  the moment to cross-examine him. On one point he made up his mind. This man
  and he must part company, and soon.</p>

  <p>"Why did you come here?"</p>

  <p>"Thought you were in London," said the other coolly. "I've been here
  before to see you, and I didn't think you'd mind my using your house for a
  day or two&mdash;maybe a week or two," he added, his eyes fixed on the
  other's face.</p>

  <p>Gilder scratched his chin thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that it will do me much good if it's known that you're an
  ex-convict."</p>

  <p>"They needn't know; why should they?" said the other.</p>

  <p>"Did you bring my car here?"</p>

  <p>Thomas nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was going over to Red Farm first; there's a groom there who's a friend
  of mine. Then I saw your car and thought something had happened to you. I
  waited for a time, and when you didn't turn up I brought it along."</p>

  <p>"Did anybody see you?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody. It was nearly dark."</p>

  <p>What was the man concealing? The impression that Gilder had&mdash;and he
  was a skilful reader of minds&mdash;was that Thomas was bursting with some
  vital information. Once or twice it had been at the end of his tongue, and he
  had inhibited the sensation.</p>

  <p>"You can stay here if you like; I'm going to town. If I get a letter from
  the local police saying you're living in the house, I shall write saying that
  you have no authority. You understand that I must protect myself?"</p>

  <p>"I can understand that, guv'nor."</p>

  <p>Again his lips moved to speak, and again he checked himself.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to tell me?"</p>

  <p>"It's too big to tell. I am going to keep it. Maybe if you come down later
  I'll spin you a story that's worth a million dollars."</p>

  <p>Thomas had once spent twelve months in a Canadian penitentiary, and it was
  his favourite pose that he was an American crook.</p>

  <p>"A million dollars&mdash;yep!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

  <p class="first">GILDER poured out the tea, helped himself to biscuits, and,
  his hunger appeased, went into his room, and from a bureau took a complete
  change of clothes. The water was too cold for a bath, and he had a rub down
  with a rough towel as a substitute. He felt another man when shaved and clean
  and warm. He came back to Thomas, who was smoking a short briar pipe, peering
  into the fire.</p>

  <p>"When you've decided to talk, you had better send me a wire&mdash;not from
  Chelfordbury, but from Horsham."</p>

  <p>He wrote his address on a page of his notebook, tore it out and gave it to
  the man, then, cranking up his car, he went back through the dull morning to
  London.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock he was roused from a heavy sleep to answer the telephone.
  It was Mary Wenner, and he cursed her under his breath.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Fabe? I've been so worried about you all night, my dear. You
  didn't go back to that awful place?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come and see you this afternoon," he interrupted. "Don't talk on the
  telephone: people can hear."</p>

  <p>"Fabe, dear"&mdash;there was a note of real anxiety in her
  voice&mdash;"you didn't go back and get any of that gold, did you? I know
  you're awfully brave, but I wouldn't have you risk your life for the
  world."</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't get any gold," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she replied, and in that "Oh!" was disappointment and annoyance. "It
  wasn't so bad for you, a man," she said, with some asperity in her tone.
  "Here I've been laying in bed all night thinking of you, and worrying about
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will see you this afternoon," he rasped, and hung up the receiver.</p>

  <p>He had no intention of seeing her that afternoon or any other afternoon,
  but in this matter his will was not the determining factor. Soon after tea,
  when he was preparing to go out, she walked into his dining-room unannounced.
  What she had told his servants, he shuddered to think. She passed swiftly
  across to him, stooped and kissed him chastely on the brow, and then seated
  herself by his side.</p>

  <p>"Dear," she said, and he closed his eyes patiently, "do you mind if I do
  something that seems a teeny-weeny bit deceitful?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mind&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"But this is something which affects your honour, dear." Her sober eyes
  were fixed on his. "You must never think I'm not faithful to you and all that
  sort of thing, but he's written to me such a pleading letter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who has written?" he asked, suddenly interested.</p>

  <p>"Arthur. I've also had a letter from his sister; she wants me to go down
  and spend the weekend with them, and of course I'd much rather stay up here
  with you. But I feel I ought to have it out with Arthur and let him know that
  my affections are no longer his. After all, even if we didn't get the
  fortune, I know that I'm dealing with a gentleman who doesn't want me for my
  money alone. And you're not exactly a pauper, are you, dear? I went and asked
  a young gentleman I know at Stubbs' Agency, and they told me that you were
  worth at least a hundred thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Gilder groaned.</p>

  <p>"And I have your promise, in writing."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you've got everything, my dear Mary," he said wearily.</p>

  <p>"And, Fabe, dear, such a curious thing happened about that paper. When I
  took it from under my pillow this morning, what do you think? All the writing
  had disappeared! You could have knocked me down with a feather."</p>

  <p>He stirred uneasily in his chair.</p>

  <p>"That is most extraordinary," he found words to say. "I was so upset about
  it that I took it to a gentleman friend of mine, who's in the conjuring
  business. You've probably seen him: he takes rabbits out of paper bags, and
  he says that you must have used invisible ink, and he showed me how to bring
  the writing back and make it permanent."</p>

  <p>"And did you?" asked Gilder hollowly.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course I did, dear. You just squeeze a lemon, rub it over the
  paper and hold it in front of the fire."</p>

  <p>Gilder's head reeled. All he could say was "Oh!" This was awkward &mdash;
  very awkward; but it was a difficulty that might easily be surmounted. At the
  worst he could buy her off for a thousand, and the promise of marriage was
  contingent. Still, it was a very unpleasant document to be produced even in a
  breach of promise case; for, strong in the faith of the invisible quality of
  his ink, he had made an agreement which was very damaging to himself.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to stay with the Gines?"</p>

  <p>"I think so, dear." The hesitation was assumed, he knew; she had already
  made up her mind. "I really think that I ought to go. Arthur, of course, is a
  very old friend, and although he's nothing to me, any more than the dirt
  beneath my feet, and I should no more think of throwing myself at his head
  than I should of flying to the moon, well, I feel I ought to go."</p>

  <p>"Then for heaven's sake go!" he said curtly, and she murmured her thanks,
  and would have lingered on, but he accompanied her to the door and opened it
  very pointedly.</p>

  <p>He gathered that, whilst she held him to his promise, she had not
  altogether lost hope of bringing Arthur Gine to heel.</p>

  <p>She had hardly left the place before a telegraph boy arrived. Gilder was
  expecting a wire from one of his bookmaking businesses, now in process of
  liquidation, since their only client had passed from active operations. The
  telegram was addressed from a village five miles from Chelfordbury and
  ran:</p>

  <p class="telegram">GET DOWN HERE AS FAST AS YOU CAN. BIG NEWS FOR YOU.</p>

  <p>It was signed "T."</p>

  <p>Would Thomas talk? And what had he to say?</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE groom who brought Dick Alford's horse to the door had a
  report to make.</p>

  <p>"That fellow was seen last night, sir."</p>

  <p>"Which fellow is this?" asked Dick, as he swung into the saddle.</p>

  <p>"The Black Abbot, sir. Gill, the gamekeeper up at Long Meadow Cottage, saw
  him at four o'clock this morning walking through the Long Meadow. By the time
  Gill got his gun he'd vanished."</p>

  <p>"And what was the Black Abbot doing in the Long Meadow?" asked Dick
  sardonically. "Picking buttercups?"</p>

  <p>"It's rather late for buttercups, sir," said the unimaginative groom. "But
  Gill says that if he'd had his gun he'd have taken a pot at him."</p>

  <p>"And there would have been an inquest, and the best Gill could hope for
  would be a verdict of justifiable homicide. You can tell Gill from me that
  the Black Abbot is to be tackled&mdash;by hand! A live ghost will tell us a
  lot, but a dead ghost is practically useless as an information bureau."</p>

  <p>He cantered through the home meadows, behind the house, and, avoiding the
  abbey ruins, rejoined the winding Ravensrill. Setting his horse at a walk, he
  followed the bank of the stream, his mind so completely occupied by the
  events of the past twenty-four hours that he would have passed unnoticed the
  girl who was lying face downward on the opposite bank.</p>

  <p>It was a glorious morning, warm and sunny. The sky was an unblemished
  blue, the world was bathed in yellow radiance. Overhead, a flight of
  migratory birds were moving southward, and the faint chatter of them came
  down to him.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Sir Galahad!"</p>

  <p>He reined in his horse and looked round in bewilderment. Presently he saw
  her.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Guinevere!" he said, and, turning his horse's head to the
  stream, he came gingerly down the slope and sent the reluctant hack into the
  water.</p>

  <p>"Be careful!"</p>

  <p>"There's a ford here," he said. "In fact," as he emerged with his horse's
  girth dripping, "this is the original Chelford. Knights in armour, and
  probably Britons in feathers and woad, have crossed Ravensrill at this spot.
  What on earth are you doing?"</p>

  <p>He slipped to the ground, dropping the reins, and allowed his mount to
  forage at will. She was lying now at full length, but resting on her elbows.
  Immediately beneath her face was a slab of rock in the centre of which a hole
  some eighteen inches in diameter had been worn. When he saw this he laughed
  softly.</p>

  <p>"Leslie, what questions have you to ask the Wishing Well?"</p>

  <p>Why it was called the Wishing Well he had never learnt&mdash;no water had
  ever risen from that deep cavity, which, by some freak of nature, extended to
  unplumbed depths. Yet here, generations of country swains had come to
  prostrate themselves and bellow into the cavity the burden of their hearts'
  desire. And tradition had it that the well answered them clearly and
  intelligibly.</p>

  <p>"I'm asking about me." Her face was pink, probably from her unusual
  posture.</p>

  <p>"And what said the well?" he mocked.</p>

  <p>She scrambled to her knees and pushed back the hair from her forehead.</p>

  <p>"I'll not tell you&mdash;ask something!"</p>

  <p>With a growl and a groan he stretched himself on the warm grass and,
  hollowing his hands, roared into the crevice: "What is going to happen to
  Leslie?"</p>

  <p>They waited, and then the echo came back, queerly distorted yet
  distinct.</p>

  <p>"Marry her!"</p>

  <p>They laughed together. It was the trick of some hollow place below that
  through the ages had sent back the same reply to every question.</p>

  <p>He got up to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't wander around without my escort," he said seriously,
  and she laughed.</p>

  <p>Never had he seen her looking more beautiful than that morning. She was a
  thing of air and sunlight, a baffling unreality that did not belong to the
  sordid world in which he was living.</p>

  <p>"I got up early and was bored, so I went walking, and then I thought of
  the well and wondered whether it had learnt any new tricks. Arthur's very
  conscious of his eye and he won't go out until his face is normal. Poor
  Arthur!" She hesitated, looking at him. "You haven't found&mdash;" She did
  not finish the sentence.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman who did the shooting? No, but we have a pretty shrewd idea.
  By the way, I have fired Thomas. You remember that hangdog footman who was
  always near at hand when he shouldn't have been."</p>

  <p>"What has he done?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing particular. He is an ex-convict: Puttler recognised him as soon
  as he arrived; and I found him at three o'clock this morning coming out of
  the library and made him turn out his pockets. He had no very considerable
  sum of money in his possession, but the chances are that he had cashed it.
  Poor old Harry is such a slacker in the matter of keeping accounts that it
  will be almost impossible to secure a conviction. Of course, Thomas swore the
  money I found&mdash;not a large amount&mdash;was his, and as it meant a fuss
  in waking up Harry, who I am perfectly sure could have given me no
  information, I allowed the brute to get away with it."</p>

  <p>"Where is he now?"</p>

  <p>"Thomas? I expect he caught the first train for London. I don't suppose
  he'll be applying for a job in the neighbourhood, but to be on the safe side
  you had better tell your brother."</p>

  <p>There was a moment of silence, then she asked: "Did you find the
  rifle?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It was an Army rifle, but there isn't such a thing at Fossaway Manor,
  though there are plenty in the village. In fact, nearly a dozen of our people
  working on the estate are Territorials. Puttler says that a poacher's gang
  was responsible."</p>

  <p>Dick was a poor liar, but Leslie suspected nothing and did not question
  this theory. If she had, she might have pointed out that poachers use
  shotguns and snares, and that the rifle as an instrument for the destruction
  of game was about as valuable as a steam-hammer for tacking down carpets.</p>

  <p>They walked across the field towards Willow House, Dick leading his
  horse.</p>

  <p>"I want you to make me a promise, Leslie," he said. "What is it?" she
  asked, knowing before he spoke what it would be.</p>

  <p>"I want you to promise me not to take these early morning walks, to use
  your car and to keep to the roads."</p>

  <p>Her eyebrows rose.</p>

  <p>"Why? Surely there is no danger? You're not afraid of the Black
  Abbot?"</p>

  <p>But he did not answer her smile.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "I'm not afraid especially of the Black Abbot, but I'm very
  much afraid of the something that is behind the Black Abbot."</p>

  <p>She knew that he did not wish to be questioned further, and changed the
  subject. She had a visitor coming, she told him, and only when she told him
  who it was did his eyes twinkle.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! That lady? I suppose you realise you're harbouring a dangerous
  rival?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be horrid, Dick. The poor girl was very fond of Harry, and in the
  letter she wrote to me she told me that she hoped I wouldn't be embarrassed
  by her coming&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She would say that," said Dick grimly.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and that she had almost forgotten Harry's stupid infatuation."</p>

  <p>Dick stopped to laugh.</p>

  <p>"Can you beat that?" he asked, with tears in his eyes. "Jumping snakes!
  'Harry's stupid infatuation!' Well, I won't be ungenerous."</p>

  <p>"Don't," she warned him. "I'm rather sorry for the girl."</p>

  <p>"Don't," he mimicked. "You need never be sorry for Mary. If you keep her
  off the subject of me, you'll have a very pleasant weekend. But in the matter
  of Richard Alford she is a fanatic. I won't tell you the horrid things she
  says of me, because it would prejudice you against her."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" she challenged. "Quite a number of people say horrid
  things about Richard Alford."</p>

  <p>"Not to you," he said quietly, and she flushed, and again changed the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I'm up so early; I didn't go to bed till two."</p>

  <p>"It was ten minutes past two when your light went out," he said promptly,
  and she stared at him.</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I happened to be passing your house."</p>

  <p>He was in such a hurry to explain that she was suspicious.</p>

  <p>"The Black Abbot was about last night. Puttler and I did a little
  ghost-hunting."</p>

  <p>"Did you see him?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Nobody saw him except a terrified gamekeeper."</p>

  <p>Suddenly she turned to him with a little gasp of surprise.</p>

  <p>"It was you!" she accused.</p>

  <p>"What was me?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure I saw somebody at the lower end of the drive. You were smoking
  a cigar: I could see the little red glow; and at first I thought it was
  Harry, and this morning I found the end of the cigar near the lodge gates.
  Richard Alford, do you ever sleep?"</p>

  <p>"Frequently," he said, with a smile, and put his arm round her shoulder.
  "I'm being brotherly: take no alarm," he mocked her. "Leslie, dear, will you
  promise?"</p>

  <p>"What?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Not to wander through the fields at odd hours. I don't want to alarm
  you&mdash;I feel a brute as it is&mdash;but there may be real danger for the
  next day or two. Please don't ask me what it is, because I can't tell you;
  I'm not so sure that I know."</p>

  <p>She turned this over in her mind for a long time.</p>

  <p>"Has it to do with the Chelford treasure?" she asked, and, to her
  surprise, he nodded.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

  <p class="first">IN sight of her house he left her, and, remounting his
  horse, cantered away. She watched him until a bend of the road hid him from
  view, and then with a little sigh she walked slowly towards her home.</p>

  <p>What was the mystery? She had never taken the Black Abbot very seriously,
  believing that the apparition had its origin in a stupid practical joke
  carried out by a villager with an histrionic bent. The legend she knew: Dick
  had told her, and Harry, who kept alive all the legends of the family, had
  described in detail the eight-hundred-year-old murder. But how was the Black
  Abbot affecting her? And what was the meaning of this close guard that Dick
  Alford was keeping on her? She had no doubt that it was he who was watching
  the house in the early hours of the morning.</p>

  <p>In the night she had reached a momentous decision. It had been made after
  long thought and heart-searching, and she would have given everything to have
  had the courage to have told Dick that morning. But in that bright, sunlit
  world she was averse from hurting him. But would he be hurt? Her life's
  future hung on that question.</p>

  <p>She had been dimly conscious that a man was standing before the gate of
  Willow House. She had seen him when she was some distance away, and now, as
  she drew near, she had a feeling that he was waiting to speak to her. He was
  tall and wearing an ill-fitting grey suit and a golf cap; from his lips
  drooped a limp cigarette. He took his hands out of his pockets as she came
  near and touched his cap, and then she recognised the ill-favoured Thomas,
  the ex-footman.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, miss," he said.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Thomas."</p>

  <p>She viewed with more interest than she had done heretofore the lank,
  awkwardly made man.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if I can have a word with you, miss?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I can do nothing for you, Thomas," she said. "Mr Alford tells
  me he has discharged you."</p>

  <p>He forced a grin.</p>

  <p>"Mr Alford never did like me, miss," he said. "I've been falsely accused,
  and I'm going to see my lawyer when I get to town. One minute, miss," he said
  hastily, as she was opening the gate. "I could tell you something that would
  be worth a lot to you."</p>

  <p>Her grey eyes fixed him in a steady stare.</p>

  <p>"You can tell me nothing that would be of the slightest value,
  Thomas&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"Oh, couldn't I!" His head went up and down in a succession of nods. He
  was ludicrously like a nodding mandarin she had on her writing-table. "You
  don't know what I know. I could tell you something, and I could tell Mr Gine
  something, that nobody don't know. People talk about the Chelford treasure
  &mdash; "</p>

  <p>"I don't want to hear any more," she said, and, turning, walked up the
  drive.</p>

  <p>For a moment he glared after her as though he contemplated following, but
  thought better of it, and, lighting the cigarette, which had gone out, he
  slouched back to his borrowed home. And then an idea occurred to him. Beyond
  the low wooden fence was a thick belt of laurels. If one of his plans were
  carried out and he had to make a quick exit from Chelfordbury, it might be
  worth while to reconnoitre this house. He jumped over the fence and made a
  cautious progress through the bushes.</p>

  <p>"Who's that you were speaking to, Leslie?" Arthur Gine was lying in a
  deck chair on the lawn, his eye covered with a piece of white lint.</p>

  <p>"Thomas," she said.</p>

  <p>"The footman from Fossaway? What did he bring&mdash;a message?"</p>

  <p>"No, he's been discharged," she said as she passed him. "Dick suspects him
  of stealing, and he sent him about his business this morning."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Dick, then?" he asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I met him; he was riding over to see the miller." She lingered at
  the back of the chair.</p>

  <p>"You always seem to be meeting that fellow," he mused, with a frown. "It
  is 'Dick this' and 'Dick that.' Do you think it's wise, Leslie, playing with
  fire and all that sort of thing? You never tell me you meet Harry."</p>

  <p>"Harry never comes out of his library," she said with a smile, "and it's
  difficult to miss Dick if you're out of doors. Not that I've ever tried to
  miss him."</p>

  <p>He took out his cigarette and looked at it thoughtfully, his lips
  pursed.</p>

  <p>"Dick's a good fellow," he said again, "but it is unnecessary for me to
  remind you that he is a second son, and as poor as a church mouse. Yes,
  Leslie, I'm going to insist on that poverty. After all, you're not marrying a
  pauper in Harry. And I tell you frankly that it is necessary that you should
  marry a rich man!"</p>

  <p>The truth was coming&mdash;she braced herself to meet it. "Who will also
  take my fortune on trust," she said quietly. "If I married Dick, who is a
  business man, he might ask to see my bonds and shares."</p>

  <p>A tense moment of silence, then: "There are no bonds or shares!"</p>

  <p>He had to set his teeth to make his confession. He could not see her face;
  he dared not look round or meet her eyes.</p>

  <p>"There are no bonds or shares?" she repeated slowly. "Then what I said in
  the car was right? I am penniless!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

  <p class="first">THE truth was out. Leslie stood rigidly behind her brother,
  looking down on him.</p>

  <p>"I am penniless?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He had to wet his dry lips before he could speak. "I've been trying to
  work up courage to tell you this for a long time," he said. "I'm a
  coward&mdash;a cur! You have a few thousand pounds that I couldn't handle,
  but every other penny of your fortune I have spent." His voice was hoarse,
  scarcely recognisable. "You'll have to know this sooner or later; you might
  as well know it now. I don't know what you'll think of me. I'd like to say
  that I didn't care, but that wouldn't be the truth. I've gambled away a
  quarter of a million, and I'm as near to bankruptcy and ruin as makes no
  difference."</p>

  <p>He pulled the lint bandage from his eye and got up and faced her. Save for
  the discoloration of his cheek, he was white as chalk.</p>

  <p>"I'd no intention of telling you," he said in a low voice, "but you piqued
  me into it, and I'm glad it's over."</p>

  <p>Raising his eyes to hers, he did not see the look of condemnation he
  expected. There was neither contempt nor consternation in her face. The red
  lips were curved in a half-smile, and in her eyes was nothing but kindliness
  and pity.</p>

  <p>"Thank God!" she said in a low voice, and he could not understand her.</p>

  <p>"This means, of course, that Chelford will have to take you without a
  fortune," he said.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I have already written to Harry, breaking off my engagement," she
  answered him. And then her arm slipped through his. "Let us go in to
  breakfast," she said. "This is one of the happiest days of my life."</p>

  <p>The letter came to Harry Alford, Earl of Chelford, with two or three other
  personal letters; his main correspondence was with London booksellers, for he
  was a restless collector of ancient tomes. He looked at the letter,
  recognising the handwriting, frowned and turned it over. Then, with some
  evidence of annoyance, he slit the flap.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Harry,</p>

  <p class="letter">I have thought for a long time that we have so little in
  common that a marriage between us could not possibly lead to happiness for
  either of us. I suppose the correct thing to do would be to send back my
  engagement ring, but fortunately, or unfortunately, you forgot to present me
  with this token! I wish you every happiness, and I hope that we shall still
  be good friends.</p><br>

  <p>Harry read the letter, rubbed his forehead in perplexity, then, rising
  from his chair, almost ran from the library. Dick was on the lawn, playing
  with his dog, when his brother burst into the little study.</p>

  <p>"I say, look at this! What do you think of it?"</p>

  <p>Dick read the letter with a troubled face.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said.</p>

  <p>"Sorry!" said Harry shrilly. "It's disgraceful! I shall look a perfect
  fool! Leslie's treated me very badly indeed&mdash;but that reference to the
  engagement ring is in shocking bad taste."</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd given her one," said the patient Dick. "Didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"It is a barbarous and stupid practice. I never dreamt of giving her a
  ring. Why should I? She had a ring, a beautiful one. You must have seen
  it&mdash;a diamond that she always wears. What is the sense of it? The
  reference is in very bad taste&mdash;shocking!"</p>

  <p>And yet, in spite of his agitation and anger, Dick thought he detected
  relief in his brother's voice. But his vanity had been hurt, and that is a
  sore place with many men of greater calibre than Lord Chelford.</p>

  <p>"Without any warning. She was here yesterday, but said not a word about
  it!"</p>

  <p>"You hardly gave her a chance," said Dick. "You scarcely spoke to her, and
  really, Harry, you took no trouble to entertain her. Be reasonable."</p>

  <p>Harry fondled his chin and glared through the thick lenses of his horn-
  rimmed spectacles.</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," he said, with sudden mildness. "But really, I'm not a
  marrying man. I want no more than my books and my mission. But I'm going to
  look a fool over this business, Dick." His anger was rising again. "Everybody
  in the county knows we're engaged, and they'll come prying around to discover
  what is wrong. We shall have those beastly newspaper men sitting on the front
  step, and that is more than I can endure!"</p>

  <p>"Then let them come to me," said Dick. "I'll give them all the explanation
  they need, and they'll be sorry they asked. As for newspaper men, I eat 'em
  alive!"</p>

  <p>Still his brother was not wholly mollified.</p>

  <p>"What made her do it? Do you think she's found somebody else she likes
  better?" He peered at Dick in his short-sighted way. "That would make it even
  worse. I'm very annoyed with Arthur Gine. He threw this girl at me."</p>

  <p>"Don't let us talk about it," said Dick sharply. "It isn't a very
  dignified attitude to take."</p>

  <p>His brother looked at the letter dubiously.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do?"</p>

  <p>"Write a charming letter, freeing her," said Dick. "You can do no
  less."</p>

  <p>"But do you think she's got another man in her eye?" demanded Harry.</p>

  <p>"She has probably a dozen," said the other brutally. "Do as I tell you,
  Harry."</p>

  <p>And Harry Alford went grumbling back to the library.</p>

  <p>So she had done it! Dick hardly knew whether to be elated or depressed. A
  week ago he would have been the happiest man in England; today &mdash; he
  shrugged his broad shoulders, pulled his pipe from his pocket and savagely
  stuffed tobacco into the bowl. This would mean a break, for a time at any
  rate, between the Gines and Harry, and there arose an alarming thought.
  Suppose Harry transferred his legal business to another firm? That would mean
  ruin for Arthur Gine. Dick had so far been able to cover up the defalcations
  of Leslie Gine's brother, and in a few months he could have obliterated all
  trace without hurt to the estate. But at this stage, if Harry
  insisted&mdash;</p>

  <p>"His lordship would like to see you, sir." The second footman had come up
  unnoticed behind him.</p>

  <p>Dick steeled himself for the interview and went in. His brother was
  sitting at his desk, his head in his hands, his hair rumpled and an angry
  frown puckering the white skin of his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Dick, I'm going to cut out these Gines," he said. "I want you to ask your
  lawyers to take over from Arthur, and tell them to be deuced careful and
  check every item. That fellow handles my mother's estate, and roughly I think
  he must have nearly fifty thousand pounds in securities. If there's a penny
  missing, Dick, I'll prosecute the fellow&mdash;I will, by God! He's made a
  fool of me before all the county, and if I get half a chance I'm going to get
  back on him."</p>

  <p>Dick's heart sank.</p>

  <p>"What lawyers do you suggest?"</p>

  <p>"Sampson &amp; Howard. They're good people and they're not too friendly
  with Arthur. Will you take that in hand, Dick?"</p>

  <p>Dick Alford nodded. As soon as he could escape from his brother's
  presence, he went round to the garage and, taking out his car, drove to
  Willow House. Arthur was still on the lawn, walking up and down, and from his
  attitude of depression Dick gathered that something unusual had happened.
  Possibly he had been told about the breaking off of the engagement. But here
  he attributed the wrong cause.</p>

  <p>"I want to see you, Gine."</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine started and turned at the sound of the voice.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he said awkwardly. "Does Harry know?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"And he's very angry, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"He is rather furious. That's what I've come to see you about. Where is
  Leslie?"</p>

  <p>"She's in the house. Do you want her?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Dick quietly. "I want to talk with you. Come for a walk with
  me."</p>

  <p>They strolled out of all possibility of earshot from the house, and then:
  "Harry has decided to take the legal management of the estate out of your
  hands, Gine," he said. "He spoke to me this morning of some funds that you're
  handling&mdash;about fifty thousand pounds' worth of stock from the late Lady
  Chelford's estate. Is that money intact?"</p>

  <p>Arthur did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Is that money intact?" asked Dick again.</p>

  <p>"No," said the other huskily; "not a penny of it."</p>

  <p>Dick stared at the man in horror.</p>

  <p>"You mean the money is lost?"</p>

  <p>Arthur nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was persuaded to put it into an oilfield in Texas. The shares are
  not worth two cents a thousand."</p>

  <p>Dick groaned.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you fool, you cussed fool!" he muttered. "Don't you realise what this
  means? I can't cover you up now, not even for Leslie's sake. You madman!"</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine passed his hand wearily over his eyes.</p>

  <p>"What is the use of ragging me?" he asked plaintively. "I've been
  expecting this trouble, and have lived under the shadow of it for years. I'll
  have to take my medicine."</p>

  <p>"And Leslie?" asked Dick sternly. "What of her? Has she to take your
  medicine too?"</p>

  <p>The man's pallid face was distorted painfully.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk about Leslie, for God's sake!" he said. "That's the worst of
  it. I'm not scared of Dartmoor or bankruptcy or anything. Leslie's the only
  fear I have."</p>

  <p>"Can you raise the money?"</p>

  <p>Arthur gave a harsh little laugh.</p>

  <p>"Raise it? How do you think I can raise fifty thousand?"</p>

  <p>"You have no friends?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer's lips curled.</p>

  <p>"Not fifty thousand pounds' worth," he said curtly. "No, I'm afraid,
  Alford, I've got to go through with it. I've been a blackguard, a vain,
  stupid fool&mdash;I've asked for all that is coming to me and I shall not
  squeal."</p>

  <p>Dick was silent, going over the problem that this horrible situation
  presented. Arthur could go to prison and stay there for the rest of his life,
  for all he cared; but Leslie: this would break her heart.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I want you to promise me," he began, as he foresaw one
  possible solution which might present itself to Arthur's mind.</p>

  <p>The lawyer smiled and nodded.</p>

  <p>"You can trust me," he said. "I've got some sort of religion tucked away
  inside my system. Self-destruction is not my idea of a gentleman's solution.
  I tell you I'll stand up to anything that comes, and I'm not going to blow my
  brains out and leave a coroner's jury of yokels and carpenters to discuss my
  private affairs and probe into my iniquities. When will the transfer take
  place?"</p>

  <p>"We've got a week yet," said Dick. "I can hold it up for that long; but
  once the papers are in the hands of the other lawyers, nothing can save
  you."</p>

  <p>A week! Arthur Gine pinched his lower lip in meditation. Seven days. So
  far as he was concerned, if he had seven years to make reparation he could
  not see daylight.</p>

  <p>"And get out of your mind that you're going to find the Chelford
  treasure," said Dick, and the shock made the man jump.</p>

  <p>"Why, how do you know&mdash;" he stammered.</p>

  <p>"I know all about that. I tell you that you can cut it out. That isn't a
  solution. It's only robbing Peter to pay Peter; for if there is any gold
  &mdash; and heaven knows I doubt it&mdash;it belongs to Harry, and must go to
  Harry. What about Leslie's fortune? Of course that is non-existent. Does she
  know?"</p>

  <p>"I told her this morning," said the man, and now Dick understood his
  depression. "She took it like a brick; in fact, she seemed almost happy about
  it. And why, I can't for the life of me understand. Women are queer
  things."</p>

  <p>"I know one woman who is the most wonderful thing in the world," said Dick
  softly.</p>

  <p>He did not wait to see Leslie, but left as hurriedly as he came, and the
  man who had been lying at full length beneath the laurel bushes waited till
  the two men had disappeared, and then crawled painfully and carefully back to
  the road, mounted the wall and stepped out for the nearest telegraph office
  to send his news.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. GILDER arrived at his cottage in the evening and found
  his "tenant" sitting on the doorstep smoking a pipe. Fortunately, the cottage
  was in the middle of a thin plantation of trees, and the river at the back
  made an approach from that direction impossible. Nevertheless, Mr Gilder was
  alarmed at the lack of precaution the man showed.</p>

  <p>"If you're going to stay here you've got to keep inside the house. I tell
  you I don't want people to know that you're living here. Now, what is the big
  news?"</p>

  <p>"Come inside," said Thomas, with a grin, and his host felt that the
  invitation into his own house was a little superfluous.</p>

  <p>Thomas was not a good story-teller, and it was with many "You see what I
  means," and at inordinate length, that he unravelled his tangled
  narrative.</p>

  <p>"I'd been hanging round the house all the morning. I wanted to have a talk
  with the young lady."</p>

  <p>"What about?" demanded the other.</p>

  <p>"About a certain thing."</p>

  <p>"Now see here, Thomas: you're not to speak to Miss Gine&mdash;do you
  understand? You're not to approach her, and you're not to go anywhere near
  the house."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's not a bad thing that I was there this morning," grinned
  Thomas. "Because I heard something that will make you jump!"</p>

  <p>It took half an hour for him to repeat, with more or less accuracy, the
  conversation he had heard on the lawn. When he came to the vital point, Mr
  Gilder whistled.</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine had managed the Chelford estate without his assistance, and
  Gilder was as ignorant of the particulars of the property as if it were in
  some other office.</p>

  <p>"Fifty thousand, eh?" he mused. "Well, that's more than Arthur Gine will
  collect in a hurry."</p>

  <p>"That's what he said himself," said Thomas. "He said to Alford: 'Friends?
  Well, I haven't got fifty thousand pounds' worth'&mdash;those were his very
  words. He said, 'I'll go to Dartmoor, and that doesn't worry me. What worries
  me is Leslie.'"</p>

  <p>"Did you hear when the transfer was to be complete&mdash;I mean, when the
  stocks were to be handed over to the other lawyers?"</p>

  <p>"In a week," said Thomas. "Mr Alford said, 'I can hold it up for a week,
  but I can't keep it any longer. And once those papers are in the other
  bloke's hands, your name is mud.'"</p>

  <p>Fifty thousand pounds! Gilder paced up and down the narrow room, his hands
  behind him.</p>

  <p>"You say that the engagement with his lordship is broken off?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't say so," said the man, "but that's how I took it. He said, 'Was
  Harry very annoyed?' That's his lordship. And Alford said, 'Yes, and he's
  going to change his lawyers.' And he said, 'What about Leslie's
  fortune?'"</p>

  <p>"Call her Miss Gine, will you?" interrupted Gilder roughly.</p>

  <p>"He didn't say Miss Gine, he said 'Leslie.' But to oblige you I'll say
  Miss Gine," said Thomas. "He said, 'What about Miss Gine's fortune? Is that
  gone?' And Gine said, 'Yes, every penny.'"</p>

  <p>This was no news to Gilder&mdash;Arthur had told him as much.</p>

  <p>"And here, Mr Gilder&mdash;the Black Abbot was around last night. I've got
  an idea about him! His lordship's scared to death of the Black Abbot. Did you
  know that?"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk to me about the Black Abbot!" snapped the man. He wanted to
  work this thing out, and the chatter of his guest disturbed him. "You keep
  inside and out of sight. I think you'd better go to London tonight. You've
  got money?"</p>

  <p>"I've got a bit of money. I was a fool! There's an old-fashioned diary in
  that library that his lordship would give a couple of thousand pounds to get
  back, and I had it in my hand! That is the thing I ought to have
  pinched."</p>

  <p>"And if it was found on you, you'd have been in prison. As it was, you had
  taken money and you got away with it."</p>

  <p>This point of view had not struck the ex-convict before.</p>

  <p>"That's true," he agreed. "Lord! what a headpiece you've got, Mr Gilder!
  If I had your brains&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Mr Gilder was not in a mood for flattery.</p>

  <p>"I've got an idea," Thomas went on, unconscious of the distraction he was
  causing. "Let me go up to London tonight and come down tomorrow."</p>

  <p>But Gilder did not hear him. Fifty thousand pounds! And for that price he
  could buy&mdash;Leslie Gine! His pulse quickened at the thought. There were
  no "ifs" or "buts." She would gladly make that sacrifice for her brother's
  sake. This time he had them all in the hollow of his hand: Leslie, Arthur
  Gine, and last, but not least in dislike, Dick Alford.</p>

  <p>Mentally he reviewed his financial position. He had considerably over a
  hundred thousand pounds in gilt-edged securities, which were easily
  realisable&mdash;or transferable. He had house property in the north of
  London, and a fairly large fluid balance at the bank. And he was fifty. There
  were fifteen years of life ahead of him&mdash;fifteen happy years. How could
  he better use his money than in buying happiness? The life companionship of
  that fragrant thing, and afterwards a will whereby she lost all interest in
  his property if she married again&mdash;Mr Gilder thought a long way ahead.
  And his marriage would be a knife in the heart of the second son, for he
  guessed Dick Alford's secret.</p>

  <p>He saw his way now; the plan was fool-proof and invincible. Nothing stood
  between him and the realisation of what had once been a wild and foolish
  hope.</p>

  <p>"A week? You're sure of that?"</p>

  <p>Thomas nodded. His cunning eyes had not left Gilder's face. Unconscious of
  the curious scrutiny, Fabrian asked: "Why do you think this news is
  interesting to me?"</p>

  <p>The man grinned and closed his right eye in a significant wink.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you ask me to tell you how often the young lady went to Fossaway
  Manor? Didn't you tell me to write everything that happened between her and
  his lordship?"</p>

  <p>Gilder was silent.</p>

  <p>It was not a comfortable thought that he had employed such a man as this
  to watch the girl he loved.</p>

  <p>"You'd better keep close here," he said. "I don't want you to be seen by
  the villagers or by the people from Fossaway Manor. Does anybody know you're
  here?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. Not even Miss Gine: she never asked&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gilder interrupted him brusquely.</p>

  <p>"If you're going to town, go by night, and come back by night. I'm not so
  sure that it won't be a good idea to stay here after all."</p>

  <p>He got back to London late in the evening and spent the night in a strict
  examination of his finances. He had dismissed from his mind all thoughts of
  the Chelford treasure. Mary Wenner had certainly justification for her
  confidence. He himself had been deceived when he had looked through the
  grating and seen those cylinders neatly arranged on the stone bench. Who had
  moved them &mdash; the Black Abbot? There must be some explanation for him.
  But he had his own ideas on the subject, and the moment had not yet arrived
  when he could test his theory.</p>

  <p>The next morning he spent in the City and at Somerset House, examining the
  will of the late Lady Chelford. Her legacies were set forth in detail, and
  the character of the shares and stocks with which Arthur Gine had been
  entrusted were particularised, and John Henry Gine, Arthur's uncle, named as
  trustee. A search of the court files failed to reveal any successor to
  Arthur's uncle, and apparently no trustee had been appointed, the stocks
  being left in Arthur's care. He would, of course, have authority to sell and
  reinvest, and there would be no trouble if shares of a corresponding value
  were handed over to Harry Alford's new solicitors.</p>

  <p>Arthur Gine had spent a very busy day in the seclusion of his study. His
  task was not a pleasant one: he was putting in order the chaos of his
  affairs, and as the list of his liabilities grew, he himself seemed to grow
  older.</p>

  <p>He had only interrupted his work to lunch with his sister, and Leslie, who
  thought that the cause of his distress was her vanished fortune, did her best
  to cheer him. His first act had been to gather on paper the remnants of her
  vanished quarter of a million, and the remnant was pitiably small, amounting
  to less than two thousand pounds. He told her this at lunch.</p>

  <p>"But that's really a much larger amount than I expected, Arthur," she
  smiled. "We shall be able to live for two years on that."</p>

  <p>It was in his mind to say that he would possibly be living for five years
  on less, but he wanted to avert that news until it was inevitable that she
  should know.</p>

  <p>At five o'clock she was having tea in solitary state when the maid brought
  her a card. She had not heard the arrival of the visitor's motorcar, for the
  drawing-room was at the back of the house. She took the card and read it.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I want to see this gentleman," she said. "Will you ask Mr
  Gine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And then she remembered the struggle on the lawn and Arthur's damaged
  eye.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'll see him," she said. "Ask him to come in."</p>

  <p>Gilder was dressed as for an official visit. He carried a glossy silk hat,
  an incongruous sight in the country, in his gloved hand; his morning coat
  sported a large yellow rose; his patent shoes shone violently. Before he came
  to Willow House he had called at his own cottage to refresh his memory on one
  or two points, but the house was empty. Thomas had evidently gone up to town,
  as he had said he would. At first he was annoyed, but later he was glad that
  the man was not there. After all, he knew enough, more than enough for the
  comfort of Leslie Gine.</p>

  <p>She met him with a distant little bow.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you will not regard me as a welcome visitor, Miss Gine," he
  said; "but I have a little business to discuss with you, and I should be
  grateful if you would give me a few minutes of your time."</p>

  <p>"Will you sit down, please?" she said coldly.</p>

  <p>He was gazing at her with that queer, hungry look she had seen in his face
  before.</p>

  <p>"I understand your engagement with Lord Chelford is broken off?" And, when
  she did not answer: "It was partly that which brought me here, and partly
  something much more serious; something," he said, with distinct deliberation,
  "which affects you very closely, Miss Gine."</p>

  <p>He paused, expecting a reply, but received none. She sat bolt upright in
  one of the deep chairs that abounded in the room, her hands folded lightly on
  her lap, her gaze fixed on his.</p>

  <p>"I was, as you probably know, for many years your brother's right-hand
  man. In consequence, I have a very intimate knowledge of his affairs; and not
  only his affairs, but the affairs of his clients. I know, for example, that
  your large fortune is mythical."</p>

  <p>If he had expected to shock her he was disappointed. She nodded
  slightly.</p>

  <p>"I know that also, Mr Gilder," she said. "I hope you haven't made this
  long journey to tell me this?"</p>

  <p>For a second he was staggered. He had expected his announcement to be the
  first of two tremendous sensations; she saw the disappointment in his face
  and could have smiled.</p>

  <p>"There is another matter," he said, recovering himself, "which does not
  directly affect you. Your brother administered the estate of the late Lady
  Chelford, in the sense that he had in his charge stocks and bonds to the
  value of fifty-one thousand pounds. That is quite usual in an old-fashioned
  lawyer's business, but today, of course, the stocks would be in the hands of
  the bank, and the dividends automatically credited."</p>

  <p>Her heart nearly stopped beating. He saw the colour fade from her face and
  was very sure of himself.</p>

  <p>"My brother has&mdash;that money?" she said.</p>

  <p>"He had it." He emphasised the word. "I understand that the present Lord
  Chelford is changing his lawyers, and in a week's time those stocks are to be
  handed over to another firm."</p>

  <p>She was speechless, knowing that he was telling the truth, understanding
  only too well just all that this narrative implied.</p>

  <p>"Fifty thousand pounds is a lot of money," Gilder went on suavely; "a very
  difficult sum to raise in a week. And in a week that money must be in your
  brother's hands."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes, and, seeing the pain in them, he was almost sorry for
  her.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;that the money&mdash;that Arthur hasn't those stocks to
  transfer?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure of this?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely sure."</p>

  <p>A long silence, when the ticking of the little French clock came so loudly
  to their ears that instinctively both glanced at the mantelpiece
  together.</p>

  <p>"Why do you tell me all this?"</p>

  <p>He cleared his voice.</p>

  <p>"A few days ago I told you, rather uncouthly, I am afraid, that I loved
  you," he said. "You may not credit me with the&mdash;the affectionate
  reverence I have for you&mdash;but I love you! There is nothing in the world
  I would not do for you, no price that I would not pay."</p>

  <p>Her eyes did not waver; she seemed to be reading his very soul.</p>

  <p>"Even to the extent of providing fifty thousand pounds in a week?" she
  said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Even to that extent," he answered.</p>

  <p>She rose slowly to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Will you write down your address?"</p>

  <p>So calm was her voice that she might have been discussing an ordinary
  matter of business.</p>

  <p>"I know where you live, but I have forgotten the name of the building and
  the number."</p>

  <p>He wrote it down with an unsteady hand and left the paper where she had
  placed it.</p>

  <p>"I must know tomorrow," he said, "yes or no."</p>

  <p>She dropped her head.</p>

  <p>"You shall know tomorrow," she said. "If I tell you I will marry you, you
  can make the arrangement about the money&mdash;I will not fail you."</p>

  <p>Without another word, he walked to the door, turned and favoured her with
  a deep bow, and went out into the hall. She heard the whirr of his car grow
  fainter and fainter. But still she did not move.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE door opened. It was Arthur.</p>

  <p>"Was that Gilder who came?" he asked, and, when she nodded:</p>

  <p>"The brute! Why didn't you send for me?"</p>

  <p>He saw her face, and, quickly: "Is anything wrong, Leslie?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, and marvelled herself at the evenness of her tone. "He
  came about some money that was in your care&mdash;a part of the estate of
  Lady Chelford."</p>

  <p>She saw from the quick change in his face that all that Gilder had said
  was true; but then, she had never doubted that.</p>

  <p>"Does Dick know?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he knows. I wonder what you think of me?" he asked huskily.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Does it matter, Arthur, what I think? What will happen if the money isn't
  found?"</p>

  <p>"I've got a week yet," he said. "How did he come to know?"</p>

  <p>"Can you get the money?"</p>

  <p>It was a useless question.</p>

  <p>"Dick said he will do his best."</p>

  <p>"Nothing can be done with Harry, I suppose?" she asked. "No, that's too
  impossible to think about. What will happen when the truth comes out?"</p>

  <p>He drew a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"I don't know; imprisonment, I suppose. It's horribly rough on you,
  Leslie. I've said that before, but words mean very little, and I am at the
  end of words."</p>

  <p>His voice broke for a second, but he caught hold of his weakness in time,
  and, seeing the fight he was making, there came a look of admiration to her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"You poor soul!" she said softly.</p>

  <p>Another long pause.</p>

  <p>"What did Gilder want&mdash;just to tell you that?"</p>

  <p>"Partly that."</p>

  <p>"And to make you an offer?" There was just a hint of eagerness in his
  tone; the drowning man was gripping hard on a straw. It made her heart ache
  to think that, even at that moment, when he knew he deserved nothing but her
  loathing, he could contemplate yet another sacrifice upon her part without
  protest.</p>

  <p>"He made me an offer&mdash;yes," she said. "And I don't know what I shall
  do. I'm going to see Dick."</p>

  <p>"Is that necessary?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>She nodded. "I'm going to see Dick," she said. "I will phone him."</p>

  <p>She moved to the instrument and lifted the receiver from the hook, when he
  caught her arm.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be guided&mdash;too much by Dick," he said breathlessly.
  "Gilder's a brute, but you might be happier with him than with Harry."</p>

  <p>She shook off his arm and gave a number. The servant who replied told her
  that Dick was out, that he had gone to London that afternoon, and would not
  be back until late at night. She hung up the instrument, went back to the
  drawing-room, and took up the paper on which Gilder had written his
  address.</p>

  <p>"You have six days, Arthur," she said. "I have less than twenty-four
  hours. I don't know whose case is the worse, but I rather fancy it is
  mine."</p>

  <p>He heard her go up to her room, and after a while followed and tried the
  door. It was locked.</p>

  <p>"Leslie!" he called anxiously, but she did not hear him.</p>

  <p>With her face buried in the pillow, she was saying goodbye to Dick Alford,
  and her heart was breaking.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch38"
     name="ch38"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">PASSING down Wardour Street that afternoon, Dick Alford had
  seen a familiar face. A man came out of a shop with a bundle under his arm,
  and, recognising the young man, turned on his tracks and walked rapidly away.
  Dick grinned; there was no mistaking Thomas, and he wondered what was the
  nature of his purchase.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the window of the store and was puzzled; for Thomas did not
  seem the kind of man who would indulge in the frivolities which were
  exhibited behind the plate-glass.</p>

  <p>Dick was not in any very good spirits. He had made two calls, and on each
  occasion had suffered a gentle rebuff. He was going now to see his last hope.
  The big City bank was closed when he arrived, but a porter admitted him to
  the presence of the old man who had been his father's best friend. The war
  had turned plain Mr Jarvis, a country banker of the eighties, into Lord
  Clanfield, the head of the greatest banking corporation in Europe.</p>

  <p>He gave Dick a hearty welcome, for the boy had been a favourite of
  his.</p>

  <p>"Sit ye down, Dick. What has brought you to this square mile of
  trouble?"</p>

  <p>Plainly and briefly Dick stated his business, and Lord Clanfield
  frowned.</p>

  <p>"Fifty thousand pounds, my dear boy! Do you want it for yourself?"</p>

  <p>"No, I want it for a very dear friend of mine." It required an effort to
  describe Arthur in these flattering terms. "He has got into a scrape."</p>

  <p>His lordship shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It couldn't be done, Dick. If it was for you, to get you out of a
  scrape&mdash;but then, you're not the kind of lad who'd ever get into
  one&mdash;I'd give it to you out of my own pocket."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't lend it to me on my personal security?"</p>

  <p>The banker smiled.</p>

  <p>"Lending it to you, Dick, would be giving it to you! What chance have you
  of repaying fifty thousand pounds? A second son! Harry is marrying this year,
  and there will be an heir to the estate next year! No, no, old boy, it would
  be impossible."</p>

  <p>Then, in his desperation, Dick Alford told the story, suppressing only the
  names. The old man listened with a grave face.</p>

  <p>"He has got to go through with it, Dick," he said. "If you get him out of
  this trouble he'll probably get into worse. The poor little girl&mdash;I'm
  sorry for her. Of course you're speaking about Gine? No, no, you needn't be
  afraid, I shan't say a word. But I've had my suspicions for a long time. Let
  him take his medicine, Dick, and do what you can for the girl. Once that
  fellow is behind bars and the whole wretched trouble is at an end, come to me
  for any money you want&mdash;for the girl. I knew her father and her uncle,
  and the great-uncle who left her a lot of money, which I suppose has gone up
  in smoke with the rest, and I'm willing to go a long way to help her. But you
  mustn't pledge your credit, Dick, for that worthless man."</p>

  <p>Dick came away from the City weary and sick at heart, too dispirited even
  to interview the fourth man he had intended seeing. His only hope now was his
  brother, and he knew Harry's obstinacy too well to expect help from that
  quarter, which could not even be asked for, except by betraying as the
  borrower the man for whom he had conceived an unreasoning hatred.</p>

  <p>Monkey Puttler met him at the station, and had a piece of news to
  impart.</p>

  <p>"That bird Thomas is still in the neighbourhood," he said. "He's been
  living in Gilder's cottage."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" said Dick. He was really not concerned with Thomas or Gilder or
  anything in the wide world except the heartbreak that awaited Leslie
  Gine.</p>

  <p>"Gilder's been down today. Ascot's all over, isn't it? Anyway, he was
  dressed like a doctor in new clothes&mdash;top hat and everything."</p>

  <p>"Where has he been?" asked Dick, with sudden interest.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I guess he went to call on Mr Gine. I saw his car coming
  out of the drive, and he looked very pleased with himself. And I've found the
  rifle."</p>

  <p>"Where did you find it?" asked Dick quickly.</p>

  <p>"Up against the river. Someone must have thrown it in, but didn't throw
  hard enough. There were three or four cartridges still in the magazine
  &mdash; a sporting Lee-Enfield. They've tried the knife and they've tried the
  gun; I wonder what new one they'll put out on us."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Harry?"</p>

  <p>"Saw him this afternoon," said the cheerful Puttler. "He worked that
  chesil gag on me, but I didn't give him my views."</p>

  <p>In spite of his anxiety, Dick smiled.</p>

  <p>"Have you any views on chesils?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the other confidently. "He thinks chesil is an
  instrument. He doesn't seem to realise that in Elizabethan times 'chesil'
  meant 'gravel' or 'shingle.'"</p>

  <p>Dick stopped and stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Ever heard of a place called Chelsea?" said the informative Mr Puttler.
  "Do you know what 'Chelsea' means? It means 'Chesil Ey' or Shingle Island.
  Why, the word isn't even obsolete; you'll find it in any dictionary. The new
  'chesil' that is spoken of in the diary is a load of shingle he got from
  Brighthelstone. That's Brighton. Now why did the old bird want shingle?
  Obviously to put in some kind of concrete or mortar."</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake don't start on the treasure, or I shall go mad!"
  groaned Dick. "At any rate, you don't believe in its existence, thank
  goodness!"</p>

  <p>"I do," said the surprising man emphatically. "I'm as sure that those
  thousand bars of gold are in existence as I'm certain you and I are walking
  up this road. Your brother's got a book down that shows all Queen Elizabeth's
  private accounts; there's the million she stole from the Spanish ships that
  put into an English port when they were on their way to Holland; there's the
  money she got from Drake and the other seagoing burglars; but there's not a
  hint of the Chelford gold."</p>

  <p>"Then where is it?" asked Dick in exasperation.</p>

  <p>"Ask me before I go," replied the other cryptically.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch39"
     name="ch39"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>

  <p class="first">A DOZEN letters were written and burnt in the fireplace of
  her bedroom before Leslie composed the one that was eventually placed in an
  envelope and addressed to "Fabrian Gilder, Esq., 35, Regency Mansions,
  London."</p>

  <p><i>Dear Mr Gilder,</i> she wrote,</p>

  <p class="letter">I agree to your terms. The money or equivalent shares must
  be deposited in the Horsham branch of the Southern &amp; Midland Bank, in the
  name of Leslie Gilder, so that I may have control of the account from the
  moment I am married. I do not expect you to trust the word of one of my
  family, and I presume that you will wish the marriage to take place in the
  next few days. Will you please make arrangements for the ceremony, and tell
  me when and where I am to meet you? I expect it to be at a registrar's office
  by special licence. I can only say that, although this marriage is not of my
  seeking, you may trust me to be a loyal wife.</p>

  <p class="letter">Very sincerely,</p>

  <p class="letter">Leslie Gine.</p><br>

  <p>The last post was collected by a motor-cyclist postman at ten o'clock from
  a little wall box not a hundred yards from the house. There was an earlier
  collection, but somehow she could not bring herself to post the letter until
  the very last moment. Ten o'clock was an unusually late hour for a country
  collection, but it was the last box on the postman's route and was an
  especially convenient arrangement, not only for the inhabitants of Fossaway
  Manor, but for the tenant farmers who wished to notify their daily
  consignments.</p>

  <p>She saw Arthur at dinner after the letter was written, but beyond the
  exchange of a few commonplaces they did not speak. He went back to his study,
  carrying his coffee with him, and she was left alone to the contemplation of
  the dark future. She wished she had seen Dick before she wrote, but it was
  too late now. Gilder had asked her to give him his answer that night, and she
  had promised.</p>

  <p>What would Dick say? She screwed up her eyes tightly as though to hide the
  vision of him, and her lips trembled.</p>

  <p>"No weakness, Danton!" It was a favourite quotation of her childhood, and
  had been the slogan at all moments when tears were near at hand.</p>

  <p>She took the letter from her bag and looked at it. Stamped, addressed, she
  had but to drop this into the little letter box, and thereafter the angle of
  life was twisted to a new prospect: the bleakest, dreariest prospect that any
  woman had faced.</p>

  <p>And it had to be done. The hands of the clock moved slowly and inexorably
  round. Nine o'clock&mdash;a quarter past&mdash;twenty minutes to ten; she set
  her teeth and got up from the little table where she had been trying in vain
  to concentrate her mind upon a game of patience, went upstairs and put on her
  hat and coat, and, with the letter tightly gripped in her hand, stole down
  across the hall, opened the door and went out.</p>

  <p>It was very dark; she could scarcely see her way down the drive. Clear of
  the overhanging trees, her eyes, grown accustomed to the darkness, made out
  the road. She thought that she saw somebody on the road ahead and heard
  footsteps, but she was nervy, she told herself. Nevertheless, she stopped and
  listened. She heard nothing and went on.</p>

  <p>A few minutes' walk brought her to the pillar box, and here she waited. A
  big spot of rain fell upon her hand; she heard the sough of the wind through
  the trees; and then, far away, she saw a tiny star of light and heard the
  faint clank of the postman's cycle. She thrust the letter into the box and
  turned to retrace her steps.</p>

  <p>Then it occurred to her that the postman would pass her, and she did not
  wish to see him. Which way should she go? Her heart and inclination beckoned
  to Fossaway Manor. Dick&mdash;she must see Dick. She fought against the
  madness; the postman's light grew brighter. Then she ran, down towards the
  cut road, through the gate and up the slope to the abbey. There she sat down
  to recover her breath, and presently she saw the reflection of a lamp, heard
  the thunder of the postman's motor cycle as it passed.</p>

  <p>There went fate, on that dark road, noisily, bumpily. The red light faded
  from sight, and she got up, walked leisurely past the abbey ruins, without
  one thought of ghosts or haunting spirits, and took the lower and shorter
  path to the Manor.</p>

  <p>She was halfway across the Long Meadow when she stopped. Fear was
  clutching at her heart; she could feel the flesh creep on her neck, and,
  turning, looked back. Somebody was following her. Consciously she had heard
  no sound, but to her heart flashed a warning signal that set it racing. She
  could see nobody. It must be her imagination, she told herself; yet here,
  reason and instinct were at variance, and instinct won. She knew there was
  somebody immediately behind her, less than twenty yards away.</p>

  <p>She could intercept the long drive to Fossaway Manor before she could
  reach the house. She decided to make the longer journey, and, turning
  abruptly, walked with quick strides across the velvety grass-land in the
  direction of the elms which flanked the drive. Once she looked back, and
  thought she saw a moving shape. She quickened her steps, broke into a gentle
  run. She must not allow blind panic to overcome her, she told herself.</p>

  <p>Again she looked back but saw nothing, and, ashamed of her fear, she
  slowed to a walk and reached the elms and the drive with heartfelt
  thankfulness. Exactly how she should break in upon Dick she did not know. She
  hoped he would be in his study, and that she could call him out from the
  lawn.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer she came to the house, and then, of a sudden, she
  whipped round. Somebody was behind her: she was sure of it now. She heard
  their feet upon the gravelled road.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" she called.</p>

  <p>There was no answer, but the footsteps stopped. They might be walking on
  the grassy verge, she thought, and, turning, ran up the drive. Whoever
  followed was running too. She heard a sibilant whisper and her blood turned
  cold. Then, as she emerged from the trees, she saw a figure against the grey
  sheen of the round pond, saw the shape of it&mdash;the long habit and the
  heavy cowl. With a scream she flew.</p>

  <p>The drive continuing past the window would bring her to Dick's study. She
  saw with a gasp of relief that the door was open and a light shining inside.
  Over her shoulder she saw the queer shape again, and screamed. In an instant
  Dick was out of the study and had caught her in his arms.</p>

  <p>He listened to her breathless story, then almost carrying her to his room,
  he put her in a chair and ran out into the night. In a few minutes he came
  back.</p>

  <p>"I saw nothing," he said. "It was the Black Abbot, you say?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know; something in a cowl and habit: I'm sure of that."</p>

  <p>It was a bad introduction to the story she had to tell; indeed, in her
  terror, she almost forgot the object of her visit.</p>

  <p>"Did Arthur come with you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Dick, I know," were the first words she said when she had recovered her
  breath.</p>

  <p>"You know what?"</p>

  <p>"About Lady Chelford's money."</p>

  <p>She saw his face change.</p>

  <p>"Did he tell you?" he asked, the red coming into his face.</p>

  <p>"Not Arthur, no. It was Gilder."</p>

  <p>"Mr Gilder told you? I knew he had been and I knew he had called. Was that
  why he came?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"For nothing else?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; he came to offer me the money."</p>

  <p>She saw his eyes narrow.</p>

  <p>"He did? At a price, of course?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you&mdash;what did you say?"</p>

  <p>She found a difficulty in breathing; speech for the moment was impossible
  without making a fool of herself.</p>

  <p>"You agreed?"</p>

  <p>She nodded again.</p>

  <p>"I have just posted the letter to him," she said.</p>

  <p>She saw him bite his lip, and a red spot of blood showed. If he had
  stormed at her, cursed her, she could have borne it; but he did no more than
  look at her. There was nothing in his gaze that was uncharitable.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dick, Dick!" She was sobbing on his breast and his arms were about
  her, comforting her.</p>

  <p>"You can't do it, my dear. Anything is better than that."</p>

  <p>She shook her head, incapable of speech.</p>

  <p>"I tell you anything is better than that." His voice was hard,
  uncompromising. "Better Arthur go down for five years than that you should
  live in hell all your life! I know that man&mdash;I know his kind&mdash;it
  isn't his years, it's his mind and his evil heart. If he were twenty I would
  say, 'No, you can't do it, Leslie.'"</p>

  <p>She pushed herself gently away from him and dried her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I must, Dick; I have given my word. I cannot trick him. The last thing I
  said to him was, 'If I tell you I will marry you, you can make the
  arrangements about the money&mdash;I will not fail you.' I cannot fail him; I
  cannot fail myself."</p>

  <p>His face was drawn and haggard.</p>

  <p>"This can't be!" he said. "Something will happen. I don't know
  what&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" she gasped, terrified.</p>

  <p>From somewhere in the grounds came a shrill shriek that was hardly human.
  Again it came: a sobbing, blubbering shriek that turned her heart to ice.</p>

  <p>"Stay here," said Dick, as he made for the open window, but she flung
  herself upon him.</p>

  <p>"You shan't go! You mustn't go!" she cried wildly. "Dick, something
  dreadful is happening. Oh, God! listen, Dick!"</p>

  <p>This time the shriek was shriller, and died away into a thin wail of
  sound.</p>

  <p>He pushed her aside and ran out on to the lawn.</p>

  <p>"From which way did it come, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"Over there." She pointed ahead to the drive.</p>

  <p>"Let me come with you&mdash;do, please do!" she begged. "I dare not be
  left alone."</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said roughly, and took her arm with a grip that made her
  wince.</p>

  <p>Together they ran towards Elm Drive, and then he stopped.</p>

  <p>"Go back and get my hand-lamp. It's on my writing-table," he said. "I will
  wait here for you."</p>

  <p>She fled back to the room, took up the lamp with fingers that trembled so
  violently that she could scarcely hold it, and rejoined him.</p>

  <p>"It was over there. I heard something a second ago. If I hadn't promised
  to wait&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He turned on the light, swinging its rays over the ground before him, and
  going ahead of her. Presently she saw him stop, and a circle of light
  focussed on something brown that lay huddled on the grass.</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are," he commanded, "and turn your back."</p>

  <p>A voice hailed him in the distance: it was Puttler, and, guided by the
  lamp, he came on the scene.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Dick in a low voice.</p>

  <p>At his feet was the huddled figure of a man. He was lying on his face, and
  was attired from head to foot in a long black habit around which a rope was
  girdled.</p>

  <p>"The Black Abbot?" said Puttler incredulously. "Is he dead?"</p>

  <p>"Look," said Dick, and pointed to the wet shoulder and the horror of the
  throat.</p>

  <p>Puttler knelt down, and, putting his arms under the figure, turned it on
  its back.</p>

  <p>The face was covered by a black cowl, and this he gently raised.</p>

  <p>"Merciful God!" said Dick, in a hushed voice. He was looking into the grey
  face of Thomas, the footman.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch40"
     name="ch40"></a>CHAPTER XL</h2>

  <p class="first">"THOMAS&mdash;the Black Abbot!"</p>

  <p>Dick looked at the pitiable thing, bewildered; and then he remembered the
  girl and, with a low word of instruction to Puttler, went back to her.</p>

  <p>"Is he&mdash;dead?" she asked fearfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm afraid he is."</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;who is it?"</p>

  <p>"One of the servants," he said evasively.</p>

  <p>"Not Thomas?"</p>

  <p>Why she should think it was Thomas she could not for the life of her
  tell.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Thomas."</p>

  <p>She made no further inquiries, and they walked back without a word to his
  room. He rang the bell, and, to the footman who answered: "Ask Mr Glover to
  come to me," he said.</p>

  <p>The old butler came apprehensively. All the servants had heard the scream
  in the park.</p>

  <p>"Where is his lordship?"</p>

  <p>"He went up to bed about five minutes ago, Mr Alford."</p>

  <p>"Had he heard&mdash;anything?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. He's so particular about our talking of the Black
  Abbot&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How do you know it was the Black Abbot?" asked Dick sharply, and the
  butler explained that somebody had seen the figure in the grounds.</p>

  <p>"He was trying to open a window. One of the maids looking out of her
  window saw him walking on the paved path below, and raised an alarm. Has he
  hurt anybody, Mr Richard?"</p>

  <p>"No, he has hurt nobody," said Dick.</p>

  <p>He drew the butler out into the hall and closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"A man has been found in the grounds in the dress of a black abbot &mdash;
  and he is dead&mdash;murdered!"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, sir!" said the startled servant. "Is it anybody we know?"</p>

  <p>"Thomas," said Dick laconically, and the old man staggered back against
  the panelled wall.</p>

  <p>"Not our Thomas? Thomas Luck, the man who was dismissed?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"Get the servants to bed. Tell them that the scream came from somebody who
  was skylarking and that we caught him&mdash;anything you like." Then,
  catching a glimpse of the man's ashen face: "First of all you'd better go
  down into the dining-room and help yourself to a good stiff glass of brandy
  and water; you look a corpse, man!"</p>

  <p>"Thomas!" muttered the old man. "It's terrible! Do you think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dick cut short his question.</p>

  <p>"Do as I tell you; get the servants to bed. The police will be up here
  soon enough, but I'll arrange that your staff are not questioned till the
  morning."</p>

  <p>He went back to the girl.</p>

  <p>"As for you, young lady," he said, with a grim smile, "I seem to spend my
  life taking you back to your home."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't I stay?" she asked timidly.</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to call in the police, and I want to keep your name out of
  the business. Arthur is at home?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Arthur is at home," she said listlessly.</p>

  <p>At that moment the telephone bell rang and he took up the instrument.</p>

  <p>"Is that Lord Chelford's house?" said an unfamiliar voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Dick shortly.</p>

  <p>"I'm speaking from the sub post-office. That isn't Lord Chelford
  speaking?"</p>

  <p>"No, it's Mr Alford," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"Well, listen, Mr Alford. Have you sent anything very important from the
  local postbox?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Dick quickly.</p>

  <p>"Because our roundsman reported that the box had been tampered with. He
  couldn't get in his key, so the letters that had been posted between six and
  ten have not yet been collected."</p>

  <p>Dick uttered an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Right! When it's cleared, will you ask the postman to bring the letters
  up to the Manor? There are one or two that I want to withdraw."</p>

  <p>The man at the other end of the wire hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Why, in the special circumstances, yes," he said, and Dick hung up the
  receiver and turned slowly to the girl.</p>

  <p>"The letter box hasn't been cleared."</p>

  <p>Slowly the significance of the words dawned upon her.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Give me authority to withdraw your letter to Gilder. There are six more
  days."</p>

  <p>She held her breath. For a second a vision of her brother in convict's
  garb came to her eyes, and then she looked at the man before her. Something
  of his vitality, his confidence, passed to her soul.</p>

  <p>"I will do as you tell me," she said, in a voice little above a whisper.
  "But, Dick, what will happen?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to do my duty," said Dick.</p>

  <p>And all that sleepless night, as she tossed from side to side in her bed,
  she pondered those words but could find no solution to their mystery.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch41"
     name="ch41"></a>CHAPTER XLI</h2>

  <p class="first">PUTTLER, unshaven and weary-eyed, dragged himself to the
  study and poured out a large cup of tea that the butler had brought in, and
  drank it at a gulp.</p>

  <p>"Scotland Yard has given me charge of this case, for which you may thank
  your stars!" he said. "Considering we've had to do all our work between
  eleven and four, I think I've set up a record in investigation. Thomas'
  monkish attire was hired, as you thought, from a theatrical costumier's in
  Wardour Street&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I saw him coming out with a bundle under his arm, and wondered what use
  he could find for fancy dress," interrupted Dick.</p>

  <p>"That is fact No. 1," counted Puttler. "Fact No. 2 is that he was making
  ready for an escape. He even tried to open your local letter box, probably
  earlier in the evening. Do you send money by post?"</p>

  <p>"My brother does, frequently. It's a habit I've tried to cure, without
  success."</p>

  <p>"That is fact No. 2," said Puttler. "He couldn't open the box, but we
  found the key on him. He had moved everything of value from Gilder's house. I
  found his portmanteau packed and cached in the field where you say Gilder
  parks his car. And obviously he was coming to relieve your brother of any
  loose cash he might find in the library. I found his tools scattered on the
  flower bed under one of the library windows."</p>

  <p>"How was he killed?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>Puttler scratched his head.</p>

  <p>"By a regiment of soldiers, to judge from the appearance of him!"</p>

  <p>They talked till the sleepy-eyed Mr Glover staggered in and asked
  permission to go to bed, and then they walked out into the cold morning and
  joined the party of police that were searching the grounds.</p>

  <p>"I suppose the best thing we can do is to go to bed also," said Dick, and
  at that instant Puttler stooped and picked something from the long grass.</p>

  <p>It was a long dagger, its steel hilt black with age, the blade coated with
  something that was still wet. They looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"Do you know this?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded mutely.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Puttler.</p>

  <p>"It is the dagger that once belonged to Hubert of Redruth&mdash;the Black
  Abbot!" said Dick.</p>

  <p>The man's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"Where does it come from?"</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The last time I saw it," he said slowly, "it was hanging in the hall of
  Arthur Gine's house."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch42"
     name="ch42"></a>CHAPTER XLII</h2>

  <p class="first">"CURIOUSER and curiouser," said Puttler, who had literary
  leanings.</p>

  <p>Dick heard his name shouted in an agitated voice, and, looking round, saw
  the butler running towards him, no longer sleepy-eyed, but very alert and
  white.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, Glover?"</p>

  <p>"The maid&mdash;foolish girl only just told me&mdash;frightened!" gasped
  the old man, and pointed to the open study windows.</p>

  <p>Dick walked quickly back, followed by Puttler. Drooping in his study chair
  was a plain-looking girl, wearing over her coarse nightdress a man's
  overcoat; her lank hair falling over her shoulders, she presented a sight
  which at any other time would have moved Dick Alford to laughter.</p>

  <p>"Now, Alice, tell Mr Alford what you told me," said the old butler, beside
  himself with anxiety.</p>

  <p>It was some time before she could speak coherently, and then she told her
  amazing story. She had gone to bed in the servants' quarters soon after
  eleven, with a sick headache. She had heard nothing of the scream, but at
  some time, which she placed with accuracy, having an alarm clock with a
  phosphorescent dial by her bedside, at 1.45, she heard "a terrible commotion"
  downstairs. Her room was immediately above Lord Chelford's. She heard shouts
  and screams, the smashing of glass and the sounds of a struggle.</p>

  <p>"Hurry, hurry, woman!" said Dick, frantic with anxiety. "Downstairs, in
  his lordship's room&mdash;are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," whimpered the girl. "I simply dared not get up for fear I was
  murdered. I simply laid there and fainted and come to again."</p>

  <p>Before she had finished, Dick was across the hall and running up the
  stairs two at a time. He tried the door of Harry's room, but it was bolted.
  He called him by name, and hammered on the panels, but there was no
  answer.</p>

  <p>"We'd better break in the door," said Puttler. "Have you got an axe?"</p>

  <p>Mr Glover went downstairs in search of the tool and returned with an axe
  and a case-opener. In a second the panel of the door was smashed and Dick
  peered in.</p>

  <p>All the blinds save one were drawn, and the exception admitted sufficient
  light to enable him to examine the room. He gave one glance and his heart
  sank. The room was in hopeless confusion; the bedclothes were thrown on the
  floor, two mirrors, one a cheval glass, had been smashed; the uncurtained
  window was open. Dick put his hand through the hole in the panel and unbolted
  the door, and the two men rushed in.</p>

  <p>There were signs as of a terrible struggle. The wreckage of two chairs lay
  scattered about the floor. The table which had held the medicines was
  overturned and the floor was littered with broken glass, and wet with the
  spilt medicines.</p>

  <p>Puttler walked over to the bed. The mattress had been half dragged to the
  floor, but the pillows were still in their place, and one of these and a part
  of the under sheet were smothered with blood.</p>

  <p>Dick examined the open window. Three or four of the leaded panes were
  broken, and the steel rod that kept the windows open was bent as though a
  heavy weight had rested upon it. The ground was about fifteen feet below, and
  immediately under the window a large rhododendron bush had been broken as
  though by some heavy weight dropped upon it. Without hesitation, Dick threw
  his legs across the window sill, poised himself a moment and dropped to the
  ground. There was blood on the leaves of the bush; he could find no
  footprints. Searching the ground, he came upon a smudge of blood against one
  of the buttresses of the wall.</p>

  <p>By this time Puttler, who had chosen a more sedate method of descent, had
  joined him, and the two men went on, keeping to the paved path, and searched
  the ground for a further trail.</p>

  <p>"This happened when we were in the grounds with the local police," said
  Puttler.</p>

  <p>He had been full of self-reproaches all night, and now Dick silenced
  him.</p>

  <p>"It can't be helped," he said. "The fault is as much mine as yours. I
  ought to have expected this, after the killing of Thomas. Knowing what I
  know, I should have gone up to his room and stayed there with him, or at
  least outside. Poor old Harry! Poor old boy!"</p>

  <p>His voice broke, and for a second there were tears in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"What is this?"</p>

  <p>The paving ended abruptly and was continued by a rolled gravel path, and
  there were marks here of something heavy being dragged along. These ceased as
  suddenly as the paving.</p>

  <p>"Wait," said Dick, as the solution dawned upon him.</p>

  <p>He ran back along the wall of the wing, turned the corner, and stopped
  before the first of the library windows. It was open, and, drawing himself
  up, he dropped into the darkened room and pulled back the curtains. So far he
  had not examined the library; his practised eye, familiar with almost every
  book on the shelves, told him that somebody had been here. One section of the
  shelves had been almost cleared. A drawer in Harry's desk had been broken
  open, and on the floor he found an empty cash-box.</p>

  <p>He made a brief and hurried survey, and, returning to the open by the
  window, he rejoined the detective and told him of his discovery.</p>

  <p>Beyond the gravelled path and the dragging marks, all trace of Harry was
  lost. Ahead of them, at a distance of four or five hundred yards, was the
  river. To the left, and at this point out of sight, were the abbey ruins.</p>

  <p>An hour's search brought them no nearer to discovery, and Dick went back
  to his room to find the first of the dishevelled reporters stepping from his
  hired car.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch43"
     name="ch43"></a>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. GILDER rose at six o'clock that morning. He had spent a
  restless night and welcomed the dawn. The first post did not arrive until
  eight o'clock, and he met the postman at the door. There were half a dozen
  letters for him, and he carried them into his room and examined them eagerly.
  Only one bore a familiar postmark, and that was in a hand which he
  recognised. He tore it open and found a few scrawled lines.</p>

  <p>If I don't see you again, thank you for your kindness, and don't think too
  badly of your old friend.</p>

  <p>So Thomas had gone! With a curse he threw the letter into the fireplace
  and went back, accosting the postman as he descended from the upper floors of
  the apartments.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, there's no other letter." The man went through his bundle
  carefully. "There is another post at half past nine. The country post doesn't
  usually get into town in time for the first delivery."</p>

  <p>Gilder slammed the door and went back to sulk in his room. By this time
  his servants were about. At nine o'clock they called him to breakfast, but a
  glance at the contents of the dishes did not tempt him.</p>

  <p>His newspapers were placed folded at his hand. He opened the first, and on
  the centre page a paragraph arrested his eye.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">STRANGE HAPPENING AT HAUNTED MANOR HOUSE</p>

  <p class="newspaper">By telephone, Chelfordbury, 2 a.m.<br>
  There has been a tragic sequel to the appearance of the Black Abbot in the
  grounds of Fossaway Manor. At eleven o'clock last night, Mr Richard Alford,
  hearing screams, ran out from the house and discovered the dead body of a man
  in the habit of a monk. He had been terribly injured, there being no less
  than nine wounds. The man has been identified as Thomas Luck, a former
  footman in the employ of the Earl of Chelford.</p>

  <p>Gilder uttered an exclamation and put down the paper. Thomas! His first
  thought was for himself. Suppose it were known that this man was staying at
  his cottage, he would be dragged into the affair; inquiries would be made,
  and he would figure at a coroner's inquest, if not in a murder trial.
  Cold-bloodedly he cursed the dead man for his folly.</p>

  <p>Gilder had no doubt in his mind what had occurred. Thomas had gone back to
  Fossaway Manor to get the remainder of the cash out of the box in Lord
  Chelford's room. And then&mdash;was Thomas the Black Abbot after all? It was
  quite possible that he had used this disguise on other occasions, and he was
  in a position very favourable to such a masquerade.</p>

  <p>It was nine o'clock; the early editions would be out in an hour. He could,
  if he wished, have called up a tradesman he knew in Chelfordbury, but that
  would associate his name with the crime, and these villagers gossiped.</p>

  <p>For the time being, all thought of the expected letter went out of his
  mind. But as the tragedy became familiar to him, his thoughts came back to
  Leslie Gine. The country post would bring the letter, and he would act
  generously, munificently. There should be no haggling, no bargaining, no
  balancing of accounts to the last penny. Her word would be sufficient.
  Overnight he had written his letter, prepared the grand gesture which should
  break down the last barrier of mental resistance; and, with his knowledge of
  women, he did not doubt what form the reaction would take.</p>

  <p>He went into the little library where he did his work, opened a
  combination wall safe and took out the letter. He had read it again and again
  after it had been written, and with every reading he had the warm glow of
  complacency which men derive from the contemplation of their own
  generosity.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">My Dear Leslie,</p>

  <p class="letter">Thank you for your letter. I did not doubt that you would
  keep your word. My answer you will find enclosed herewith&mdash;a blank
  cheque. I make no stipulations, I extract no conditions. Draw the cheque for
  as much money as your brother requires to clear himself from his dreadful
  situation. I have given instructions to the bank that the cheque is to be
  honoured without question.</p>

  <p class="letter">Fabrian.</p><br>

  <p>It was characteristic of the man, who kept three banking accounts, that
  the cheque was drawn on a branch where his balance was exactly the amount
  required to liquidate Arthur Gine's liability. It would have been a simple
  matter to have filled in the form for the amount required, but there was a
  certain nobility, a magnificence, in the blank cheque. It was a carte blanche
  upon his fortune. He replaced the letter in the envelope, put it back in the
  safe and pushed the door closed as the telephone bell rang.</p>

  <p>The caller was the man who had taken his place at the office. Had he heard
  anything about Gine?</p>

  <p>"We haven't seen anything of him since you left, and the letters we have
  sent down for him to sign haven't been returned."</p>

  <p>Gilder comforted the anxious man with the assurance that Arthur would put
  in an appearance some day that week. At the back of his mind there was still
  a great uneasiness about the tragedy at Chelfordbury. He sent a maid out to
  get a copy of the sporting editions, but they had not arrived at Regent's
  Park, and he decided to take a taxi to Piccadilly Circus, and, if necessary,
  to Fleet Street, to get an early copy. Such a journey would serve the purpose
  of filling in the time until the country post arrived.</p>

  <p>It was at Oxford Circus that he saw the first newspaper contents bill. The
  first said "Terrible Tragedy in Sussex Village"; the second made him sit bolt
  upright in the car: "Well-known Earl Kidnapped and Murdered."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch44"
     name="ch44"></a>CHAPTER XLIV</h2>

  <p class="first">GILDER stopped the taxi and, springing out, grabbed at a
  paper. A flaring headline met his eye.</p>

  <p>"LORD CHELFORD CARRIED OFF BY UN-KNOWN MURDERER. FEARED DOUBLE TRAGEDY IN
  A SUSSEX VILLAGE."</p>

  <p>There were other sub-headings, but his eye ran down to the story.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">At eleven o'clock last night screams were heard in the grounds of Fossaway
  Manor, the fine old Tudor mansion which has been the country seat of the
  Earls of Chelford for hundreds of years. The Hon. Richard Alford, the only
  brother of Lord Chelford, ran out, accompanied by Detective-Sergeant Puttler,
  who was staying at the Manor as Mr Alford's guest. They were horrified to
  discover, lying on the grass, the dead body of a man dressed in the habit of
  the famous Black Abbot. The local police were immediately called in, and
  hardly had their investigations begun when, unknown to them, a second tragedy
  occurred. A maid in the employ of the Earl of Chelford, Alice Barter, who
  sleeps in a room over that occupied by Lord Chelford, states that at one
  o'clock in the morning she heard sounds of a struggle in his lordship's room.
  In terror, she did not report the occurrence till four o'clock in the
  morning. Lord Chelford's door was broken open and a dreadful scene met the
  eyes of the police officers. The room was in confusion; mirrors and furniture
  were smashed; and it was evident from the indications that a terrible
  struggle had taken place, and, either stunned or killed, Lord Chelford was
  pulled to the window and thrown out. A search of the grounds left no doubt
  that his body was dragged for some distance along the ground. At the moment
  of telephoning, says our correspondent, no trace of the body has been found,
  but from certain indications there can be little doubt that the unfortunate
  peer has been a victim of foul play. Certain of his property is missing,
  whilst a cash-box which he kept in the drawer of a desk in his library has
  been found empty. Detective-Sergeant Puttler of Scotland Yard is in charge of
  the case.</p>

  <p>The newsboy was still waiting for payment. Mr Gilder put his hand in his
  pocket mechanically and, giving him a shilling, re-entered the cab.</p>

  <p>"Drive me round the Outer Circle," he said. He wanted time to think.</p>

  <p>In a dim, uneasy way he realised how deeply he was involved in this
  tragedy. Fabrian Gilder had a lawyer's mind. He saw the connection between
  Thomas, himself and Chelford. Thomas, a known thief, harboured in his
  cottage, goes out, with or without associates, and is killed. Chelford,
  lately engaged to the girl whom Gilder himself was pursuing, disappears in
  circumstances which leave no doubt as to his death.</p>

  <p>Round and round the Regent's Park Circle the cab moved slowly, and all the
  time he was piecing together a version which would sound plausible. He had
  known Thomas; was aware that the man was dismissed, but did not know his
  criminal connections. The man had asked for shelter for a few days, and in
  charity Gilder had given it to him. He himself was in London when the crime
  was committed; had unchallengeable alibis if necessary.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he was exaggerating the seriousness of the situation, he thought.
  Putting his head out of the window, he directed the driver to take him to
  Regency Mansions. He had forgotten his key; had to ring the bell, and the
  maid who opened the door handed him the post, which had arrived a few minutes
  before. He examined the three letters carefully: none was from Leslie. But at
  the moment he was too occupied with the happenings at Chelfordbury to be
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>And then came a thunderbolt.</p>

  <p>"Mr Arthur Gine is waiting for you in the library," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Mr Gine!" he said in astonishment. "When did he come?"</p>

  <p>"Ten minutes ago, sir."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Gilder blankly.</p>

  <p>Had she sent her brother instead of a letter? Had she told him? Well, it
  was a situation that had to be faced.</p>

  <p>He walked carelessly into the little library and found Arthur Gine sitting
  in one of the easiest chairs, a book in his hand, a half-smoked cigar between
  his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Gilder."</p>

  <p>His voice was cheerful and almost amiable, and for a moment Mr Gilder's
  heart leapt. This was a friendly ambassador sent by the girl to make the
  necessary arrangements.</p>

  <p>"I think we'd better forget all that's passed," said Arthur. "We both lost
  our tempers, and there's no sense in keeping the old trouble alive. You don't
  mind my smoking?"</p>

  <p>He replaced the book he had taken from one of the shelves, dusted his
  knees carefully and then laughed.</p>

  <p>"You're thinking of marrying Leslie, I understand?"</p>

  <p>Gilder nodded, watching his visitor closely.</p>

  <p>"Expecting a letter from her? Well, I'm afraid you won't get it."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked the other, with a sudden tightening at his heart.</p>

  <p>"Because friend Thomas, who spent the evening in wholesale robbery &mdash;
  incidentally, he stole a very ancient dagger from my hall, a silver teapot
  and a few other etceteras&mdash;added to his infamy by attempting to rob a
  letter box. He didn't succeed in opening the box, but he put the lock out of
  order."</p>

  <p>Gilder breathed again. "So there was no collection, eh?" he said huskily.
  "Well, that is rather a relief."</p>

  <p>There was a quizzical smile in Arthur Gine's eyes; the discoloration on
  the left cheek had faded to a pale green.</p>

  <p>"I understand you're going to help me?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to get you out of your trouble, yes."</p>

  <p>"It occurred to me"&mdash;Arthur leaned sideways and very carefully dusted
  the ash of his cigar into a silver tray on the library table&mdash;"it
  occurred to me that you might care to give me proof and evidence of your good
  feeling."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you," said Gilder.</p>

  <p>Arthur hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I wondered whether you would write me a letter, to the effect that you
  are lending me this very large sum. You see, Gilder, although you plan to
  marry my sister, I am vain enough to wish that it should not be regarded as a
  gift or the price&mdash;the price of her marriage&mdash;but as a loan to me."
  He laughed. "Don't look at me like that, my dear fellow. I am not asking you
  for money, I am seeking a salve to my conscience. I don't want people to say,
  'Leslie Gine was sold for fifty thousand pounds.' I want to produce evidence
  that you did no more than lend me the money."</p>

  <p>A slow smile dawned on Gilder's face.</p>

  <p>"There's no objection to that," he said. "I'll give it to you now, if you
  like. Do you mind if I address you as 'Dear&mdash;Arthur'?"</p>

  <p>"Charmed," murmured Arthur.</p>

  <p>"One has to keep up the pretence of friendliness," said Gilder as he wrote
  rapidly; "and really I've no strong feeling against you, Gine. You've been a
  useful man to me."</p>

  <p>"Damned useful," said Arthur, without heat.</p>

  <p>The man blotted the letter, brought it across, and Arthur Gine read it
  carefully.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said, folded and put it into his pocket. "You may think
  I'm rather weak&mdash;which of course I am&mdash;and vain: I'm afraid there's
  no doubt about that! You will hear from Leslie when the mailbox is
  cleared&mdash;that is, if the letters are intact. There is some suspicion
  that our friend Thomas, baffled in his attempt to open the box, and inspired
  with that instinct for destruction which is one of the characteristics of the
  unbalanced criminal, threw in a couple of lighted matches. I had the
  curiosity to smell at the letter slot, and I think it is very likely that the
  police theory is correct."</p>

  <p>He rose, took up his silk hat and stifled a yawn.</p>

  <p>"We've had rather an exciting night in my part of the world. You've
  probably read all about it in the newspapers?"</p>

  <p>"Has Lord Chelford been found?"</p>

  <p>Arthur shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not at the time I left," he said. "Unfortunately Leslie was a witness, if
  not to the murder, to the finding of the first body. The poor little girl was
  knocked all to pieces. Don't bother her for a day or two&mdash;do you
  mind?"</p>

  <p>He held out his hand and Gilder took the soft, cool palm in his.</p>

  <p>"I think we shall get on together, Gine."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure we shall," said Arthur. "Do you mind showing me the way out?
  Your flat is rather like a box of tricks, and I'm never sure which is a door
  and which is a cupboard."</p>

  <p>Arthur dispensed with his car. A taxicab took him into the City, and
  another cab to a small flat in Gray's Inn where he slept when he was in town.
  He changed into a plain blue suit, carefully and reluctantly shaved off his
  moustache, and took from his pocket a pair of newly purchased horn-rimmed
  pince-nez. Surveying himself in the glass with a certain amount of
  satisfaction, he sat down and wrote a letter to his sister, then, taking a
  final survey of the little flat where he had spent many a happy bachelor
  evening, he locked the door, went out and posted the letter in the Holborn
  post office.</p>

  <p>Another taxicab took him to Croydon aerodrome, where he arrived in the
  early afternoon. He showed the officer his brand new passport.</p>

  <p>"That's in order, Mr Steele," said the official. "Your taxi is
  waiting."</p>

  <p>His "taxi" was a sturdy two-seater aeroplane. Five minutes after his
  arrival he was zooming up to the blue, and was soon a speck in the hazy sky,
  heading for France, possibly for Genoa, as likely as not, by an Italian
  liner, for Rio de Janeiro. Everything depended on how Mr Fabrian Gilder
  swallowed the pill which Arthur had administered.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch45"
     name="ch45"></a>CHAPTER XLV</h2>

  <p class="first">"BURNT," said Dick, with considerable satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"The poor brute did some good in his life&mdash;heaven forgive me for
  speaking ill of him. Where is your Arthur?"</p>

  <p>"My Arthur went to town very early," said Leslie. "There is no news of
  Harry?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"None," he said.</p>

  <p>He looked dreadfully tired and broken, she thought.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry!"</p>

  <p>He took her hand and patted it.</p>

  <p>"I wish you would go away somewhere, Leslie," he said. "Couldn't you take
  a long voyage?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I want you out of the way. I don't exactly know why, but I'm rather
  worried about you. Get Arthur&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped. It was quite possible that Arthur would not be a free agent at
  the end of the week; and, reading his thoughts, she smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do about Mr Gilder?"</p>

  <p>"Let him write. He is hardly likely to leave you in peace. But you
  understand, of course, that until Harry is found there is no danger to your
  brother. Until he appears, no action can be taken."</p>

  <p>She looked at him pityingly.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he is alive?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied shortly. "Puttler doesn't think so, but I do. We are
  dragging the Ravensrill today, but it is not deep enough to hide&mdash;a
  body."</p>

  <p>He covered his face with his hands.</p>

  <p>"I wish I were a million miles away, perched on some solitary star," he
  said wearily.</p>

  <p>She slipped her hand through the crook of his arm.</p>

  <p>"You'd be very hot," she said, with a pathetic attempt at gaiety, "unless
  I have forgotten all my astronomy."</p>

  <p>He put his arm about her shoulder and hugged her. It was an affectionate
  brotherly hug, and no more.</p>

  <p>"You've got to go away, my dear. What about the prosaic Bournemouth? Or
  the vulgar but wholesome Margate?"</p>

  <p>Again she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Or London, which I am told is a health resort?"</p>

  <p>"You're very anxious for me to go, really?"</p>

  <p>"Very," he said, with an emphasis that betrayed his concern.</p>

  <p>She drew back from him and faced him.</p>

  <p>"Dick, will you tell me something without any evasion?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that I am in any personal danger?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it," he said. "It would be cruel not to tell you the truth.
  The shot that was fired the other day was intended for you. It was fired by a
  man who is as brilliant a shot as any in England, and the height of the
  bullet mark told us that it was aimed directly at your heart."</p>

  <p>She listened, stupefied, unbelieving.</p>

  <p>"But why?" she asked, bewildered. "I have no enemies, Dick; I have wronged
  nobody. Who could do such a wicked thing?"</p>

  <p>"If I told you, you would perhaps be no wiser," he said. "There is a man
  in this world who hates you and hates me, and has good reason from his point
  of view. Now that I've told you the truth, will you go?"</p>

  <p>She thought a while.</p>

  <p>"I'll wait until Arthur comes back," she said, "and ask him to take me to
  London."</p>

  <p>And with that he was satisfied.</p>

  <p>He was leaving the house when Puttler's cycle swung into the drive.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong?" asked Dick quickly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Look at this."</p>

  <p>He took from his pocket a large sheet of foolscap paper; roughly printed
  in pencil were the words: "Lord Chelford is safe. Don't search for him, or he
  will be killed. The Black Abot."</p>

  <p>The word "Abbot" was printed with one "b." The placard had been found
  hanging from the twig of a tree, the jagged hole at the top showing where the
  mystery man had threaded the paper.</p>

  <p>"We found it halfway between the ruins and the house," said Puttler.
  "Curiously enough, we had been searching that part of the grounds only a
  quarter of an hour before."</p>

  <p>Dick handed the warning back to him.</p>

  <p>"Is that a bad joke or do you believe this paper?" asked Leslie anxiously.
  "And, Dick, couldn't I be some help? I know Fossaway Manor so well, and I am
  sure there must be places where the police haven't looked. Do you know there
  are tiny caves in the banks of the Ravensrill?"</p>

  <p>"They've all been searched, and they're not big enough to hold a large-
  sized dog," said Dick. "If you want to be helpful you can come up to the
  Manor and put my correspondence in order. I am afraid it has been neglected
  in these days, and there are a lot of bills and things to be entered up."</p>

  <p>He had no real need for her, he thought, but whilst she was in the
  neighbourhood he was anxious that she should be under his eye. She may have
  suspected something of this, but she gratefully accepted the offer.</p>

  <p>"Drive up," he warned her; "keep to the main road and the main drive.
  Don't stop for anybody, however well you know them, and take no notice if you
  hear somebody shout at you."</p>

  <p>In spite of her anxiety she laughed.</p>

  <p>"How very alarming that sounds!"</p>

  <p>After he had gone she busied herself with the affairs of the house,
  arranged the dinner for that night, and was on the point of leaving, when
  somebody rang the front-door bell. She was putting on her hat before the
  mirror in her bedroom when the maid came up.</p>

  <p>"Miss Wenner?" cried Leslie, aghast, and only then did she remember that
  at Arthur's request she had written inviting the girl to spend the weekend
  with them.</p>

  <p>Here was a complication she had not foreseen. And yet, in the space
  between her room and the hall, she had made up her mind that, if there was
  one thing she welcomed at this moment, it was the society of a woman.</p>

  <p>Mary Wenner was in the hall and greeted her as effusively as if they had
  been bosom friends, though in truth Leslie scarcely knew the girl.</p>

  <p>"My dear, I'm so glad to be back in this lovely old country!" she said. "I
  couldn't help thinking, as I was driving past dear old Fossaway Manor, how
  perfectly peaceful everything is!"</p>

  <p>Leslie could have screamed! Peaceful!</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it isn't quite as peaceful as it looks, Miss Wenner," she said
  dryly.</p>

  <p>"Call me Mary," begged the girl. "I do so dislike formalism and
  standoffishness! It will be so awkward if Arthur calls me by my name and you
  call me Miss&mdash;I mean&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll call you Mary with pleasure," said Leslie. "I think you know
  my name?"</p>

  <p>"A beautiful name," said the ecstatic Miss Wenner. "The only thing against
  it is, you can't tell whether it's a boy's or a girl's, can you? Don't you
  sometimes find that very embarrassing?"</p>

  <p>"I've never found it so yet," said the girl, leading the way up to her
  room.</p>

  <p>She waited till Mary had taken off her hat before she gave her news.</p>

  <p>"Arthur is in town, but he'll be back tonight," she said. "Have you seen
  the newspapers?"</p>

  <p>Miss Wenner shook her head vigorously.</p>

  <p>"I never read the newspapers," she said, reprovingly. "They're always full
  of lies, and after the way they roasted me over my breach&mdash;" She
  coughed.</p>

  <p>For a moment Leslie had a wild idea that the reference was an indelicate
  one, and then the truth came to her.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever have a breach of promise action?" she asked, in
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>Mary was very red, and her embarrassment was painful to witness.</p>

  <p>"I did have a little trouble with a young gentleman I went to business
  with," she admitted. "I was a mere girl at the time, young and silly as it
  were, and I must say that I felt that I had to stand up for my rights. A lot
  of people think it was unladylike, but I say that a girl who is an orphan
  without parents must look after herself. I got fifty pounds, and it wasn't
  worth the trouble and the nuisance."</p>

  <p>There was something about the girl that Leslie liked. Unconsciously she
  was amusing, but there was a sterling value in her, she thought, and Leslie
  had an uncanny knowledge of women.</p>

  <p>"No, I never read the papers, Leslie. After being told by the Daily
  Megaphone that I had a curious mentality&mdash;I shall never forget those
  words &mdash; I've given up the papers."</p>

  <p>"Then you haven't heard what has happened at Fossaway Manor?" asked
  Leslie.</p>

  <p>The startled girl listened, her mouth an O of amazement and horror.</p>

  <p>"Thomas? Why, I was talking with him only the other day! You don't think
  Harry is killed?"</p>

  <p>Leslie shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to think. Mr Alford is very confident that he is still
  alive, and they have just received a strange message which seems to bear that
  out."</p>

  <p>The girl was shocked, and Leslie could not help feeling that she was hurt
  too.</p>

  <p>"Harry Alford was the best fellow in the world," said Mary quietly. "He
  was a little irritable and difficult to get on with&mdash;you don't mind me
  talking about him?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Leslie. "You probably do not know that our engagement was
  broken off?"</p>

  <p>This seemed to be a greater shock still.</p>

  <p>"Broken off? I'll bet that was Dick Alford's doing."</p>

  <p>"Mr Alford had nothing to do with it," said Leslie, and Mary made a rapid
  re-estimation of Dick Alford's character; and she was eminently
  adjustable.</p>

  <p>"Dick Alford is not a bad fellow really," she said diplomatically. "There
  is a great deal about him that I like. And he is so good-looking!"</p>

  <p>She was a shrewd, discerning gamine, who had won through by her ability to
  adjust her views at a moment's notice. And in a fraction of a second she had
  realised that perfect harmony with Arthur Gine's sister could only be ensured
  if her views on Richard Alford underwent a very thorough reorganisation.</p>

  <p>"I didn't get on very well with him; I used to think he was a bit
  overbearing. But it must have been rather a trial for him, poor fellow!" A
  pause, and then: "I seem to have come at a pretty bad time,
  Miss&mdash;Leslie. Would you like me to go back to London?"</p>

  <p>"Wait," said her hostess, and, running downstairs, called Dick on the
  phone. He had just returned to the house as she rang.</p>

  <p>"Surely," he said. "Bring her up. I think that would be rather a good
  idea. And, Leslie, perhaps you would like to stay here the night. Arthur can
  come along too&mdash;you might leave him a note or wire him."</p>

  <p>The idea was so appealing that she put no obstacles in the way, and
  returned to carry Dick's invitation to her guest. Miss Wenner accepted with
  an alacrity that was almost indelicate.</p>

  <p>"I may be able to be of some help," she said. "I know the ins and outs of
  that place, and all the nooks and crannies. It is the treasure that's done it
  all, Leslie! He was always after that silly Life Water, and I shouldn't be
  surprised if he hasn't got into bad company."</p>

  <p>"But Harry never went out."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, he did," was the surprising reply. "He often slipped off to
  London when Mr Alford was away. And there was something queer about it,
  because Harry made me promise I would never tell Mr Richard, as he called
  him."</p>

  <p>"How often did that happen?" asked Leslie.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes once a month, sometimes twice or three times a month. He never
  went to the front drive; he followed the field path through the cutting, and
  I used to arrange for a Horsham motor cab to meet him. He used to go from
  Horsham and come back the same way, and I've known him to ring me up before
  he came back, to ask me if Mr Richard had returned."</p>

  <p>Leslie wondered if Dick knew this.</p>

  <p>"I've known him to go as many as three times a week when Mr Richard was up
  in Yorkshire, looking after the Doncaster estate," added Mary, and,
  virtuously: "I hope I have not let any cats out of the bag: all young men are
  a bit wild."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch46"
     name="ch46"></a>CHAPTER XLVI</h2>

  <p class="first">THE adaptability of Miss Wenner was never more strikingly
  illustrated than in her greeting of Dick Alford. There was a coyness, a shy
  friendliness, in her glance which might have deceived an uninitiated
  spectator into believing that they were old lovers, parted by cruel
  circumstances and meeting after an absence of years. Dick, weary and
  heartbroken as he was, found in her the first cause for amusement he had had
  in twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p>He had had rooms prepared for them in the east wing, which was opposite to
  that in which his own room and Harry's were situated. There were two small
  apartments with a connecting door, which he had assigned to Leslie and her
  guest. The next room had been prepared for Arthur.</p>

  <p>"I've moved Puttler to this wing, too," he explained, "though I don't
  suppose the poor fellow will get very much sleep for a night or two."</p>

  <p>After he had shown them the rooms he took his departure, and Leslie
  followed him along the corridor and overtook him at the head of the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>"There is really nothing I can do, I suppose, Dick?" For she had accepted
  the story of the disordered accounts as being a plausible excuse on his part
  to get her to Fossaway Manor.</p>

  <p>To her surprise he said "Yes," and took her below to the study.</p>

  <p>"Here are the estate accounts. I haven't touched them for three or four
  days. Do you know anything about figures?"</p>

  <p>She nodded wisely.</p>

  <p>"Will you start by checking these wages sheets? You'll find the books on
  the shelf, and you will be able to get the hang of my rather simple
  system."</p>

  <p>He gave her instructions how to deal with the bills that had accumulated,
  and left her very contented. It was half an hour before she remembered that
  she had left Mary Wenner in her room, and hurried upstairs to apologise. She
  was to find Mary a very capable assistant, for not only was the girl
  efficient in her work, but she knew all the domestic mysteries of Fossaway
  Manor.</p>

  <p>The two girls lunched alone, for Dick had sent a message to say that he
  would not be back in time.</p>

  <p>"The place gives me the creeps," said Mary with a shudder, and her
  nervousness was not affectation. "The whole thing is frightful! Poor Thomas
  killed, and Harry taken away heaven knows where&mdash;oh!" She sprang to her
  feet, and her face had gone pale. "I know where Harry is," she said,
  quivering with excitement. "I know, I know!"</p>

  <p>"Where?" asked the wondering Leslie.</p>

  <p>The girl ran out of the room into the hall.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mr Alford?" she asked quickly. "I must see him at once."</p>

  <p>"He telephoned from Red Farm," said Leslie, who had followed her. "Perhaps
  we can get him."</p>

  <p>She turned the handle of the old-fashioned instrument and gave the Red
  Farm number.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Dick? How lucky!"</p>

  <p>"I expected it was you. Is anything wrong?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"No; Mary Wenner has something she wants to tell you." She lowered her
  voice. "She thinks she knows where Harry is hidden."</p>

  <p>There was a silence at the other end.</p>

  <p>"She's not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no, no." With Mary within earshot, it was impossible to assure Dick
  that the girl was not trying to make a sensation.</p>

  <p>"I'll come over right away," he said.</p>

  <p>They went out to the head of the drive to meet him, and Mary offered her
  theory.</p>

  <p>"I must have been mad not to have told you about this before. I don't know
  where my wits have gone," she said. "After all my treasure-hunting and the
  horrible experience I had that night with Gilder, and not to think of it now,
  when I practically came down to show Mr Gine the place&mdash;well, I'm
  surprised at myself!"</p>

  <p>Dick listened with growing impatience to this preliminary.</p>

  <p>"Where do you think my brother is?"</p>

  <p>"Where?" said Miss Wenner triumphantly. "Why under the abbey&mdash;that's
  where. I'll show you."</p>

  <p>They walked side by side across the meadow, and as they went Miss Wenner
  related the startling story of her adventures after treasure.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I always knew that it didn't belong to me, even if I found
  it," she said virtuously; "but Mr Gilder was so very pressing that I couldn't
  very well refuse him, especially after what he'd written in vanishing ink,
  though I've got the ink back again, as he'll find out one of these days."</p>

  <p>Leslie listened, scarcely crediting her ears. Yet, unless Mary Wenner had
  an imagination of a particularly inventive nature, it was hardly likely that
  she could have made the story up.</p>

  <p>Dick examined the great corner-stone of the tower. He stood by, watching
  curiously, whilst, with a pair of scissors which she took from her bag, the
  girl pressed back the catch and sent the corner-stone turning noisily on its
  invisible hinge.</p>

  <p>The opening was between twelve and fifteen inches wide. A stout man could
  never have entered by that way, as Dick pointed out.</p>

  <p>"You had better stay here; I'll go down," he said.</p>

  <p>"You'll want a light," warned Mary.</p>

  <p>There was a lamp in his pocket. He had spent the morning peering into
  impossible dark places. In a second he had disappeared down the moss-grown
  stairs, and Leslie waited with palpitating heart for his reappearance.
  Presently they heard his voice.</p>

  <p>"Come down."</p>

  <p>"Not me," said Mary hastily. "I've been there once, thank you!"</p>

  <p>And Leslie went alone, guided by the light he showed from step to
  step.</p>

  <p>Now she was standing with him in the vaulted room. He tried first one and
  then the other of the two doors leading from the antechamber, but neither
  yielded to his touch. It was pitch dark save for the fan-shaped ray of the
  lamp. He swept the light along wall and floor, and presently she saw the
  focus halt upon a broken flagstone.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he said quickly. He had moved the light to the narrow entrance
  of the room. "Up you go; there is nothing here but mice and memories. I have
  always known there were underground vaults in the abbey. In fact, I think
  there was a report on them by one of my recent forbears."</p>

  <p>Although he was immediately behind her, his voice seemed to come from a
  distance. She was walking, and he gave her no help with his lamp, so that she
  had to feel her way up. Turning her head, she saw that he was ascending the
  stairs backwards, keeping the light covering the stairs below.</p>

  <p>"Hurry," he said tersely, and she stumbled up the remaining steps and
  emerged into the blessed daylight.</p>

  <p>It was some time before he joined them, and when he came out she saw that
  he was white to the lips.</p>

  <p>"What did you see, Dick?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he said, and slammed the stone door tight.</p>

  <p>Of the little party, only Miss Wenner was unaffected by the atmosphere
  which Dick Alford brought from that vaulted room.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;so far as Mr Gilder said&mdash;and I don't trust the man entirely,
  as you can well understand, Leslie&mdash;there were only pieces of music in
  lead cylinders&mdash;that was the word, 'cylinders.' To me they looked rather
  more like rolls. And this Black Abbot must have cleared them out whilst we
  had gone. Mr Gilder was disappointed. In fact, he was quite rude to me over
  the telephone. I do think a gentleman should keep his temper in all
  circumstances, don't you, dear?"</p>

  <p>Leslie agreed mechanically.</p>

  <p>What had Dick seen? What object was it that showed for a second in the
  light of his lamp?</p>

  <p>Near to the house he made an excuse to them. He had to go back to Red Farm
  to finish his interview with the obstinate Mr Leonard; but he did not take
  his car. He said he would take the short cut, and Leslie thought it was not
  the moment to question him. She watched him until he disappeared in a fold of
  the ground. He was heading for the abbey. The other girl had gone in to
  finish her lunch, and Leslie hesitated. The thought of his going back to that
  dark room again filled her with blind panic. She wanted to call out to him
  and bring him back, but he was out of hearing now, and she obeyed an impulse
  and went after him.</p>

  <p>He was not in sight until she climbed the second of the gentle slopes.
  Here she stopped; he might resent being overlooked, and she lay down on the
  grass, watching him. She saw him come to the square tower, pause at the
  corner, and disappear apparently into space. From such a distance the effect
  of his entry was eerie. The entrance was so small that he seemed to melt into
  the solid stonework. Ten minutes passed, a quarter of an hour, and then a
  long, interminable wait; she heard the village clock strike two. A lark in
  the blue was singing his passionate song; over by Red Farm a donkey was
  braying&mdash;a ludicrous accompaniment to what might be stark tragedy.</p>

  <p>She was on the point of rising and running across to the ruins, to follow
  him into the depths, when he appeared again. He came slowly forth, turned and
  closed the stone door and leaned against it, his head on his arm, a picture
  of tragic despair.</p>

  <p>She stopped and sank down on her knees, the better to escape observation,
  and presently he walked slowly away, and it was the gait of a broken man.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch47"
     name="ch47"></a>CHAPTER XLVII</h2>

  <p class="first">HURRYING back the way she had come, she joined Mary in the
  study. Puttler she had not seen since the early morning, when he cycled to
  Willow House to bring the notice he had found.</p>

  <p>"My dear," said Mary, "I'm not so sure I shall stay here tonight. This
  place is full of shocks! I'd like to see your brother very much indeed, but
  you can tell him all about the room under the abbey, can't you? That's where
  the gold is&mdash;you mark my words!"</p>

  <p>"The gold?" Leslie for a moment did not understand. "Oh, you mean the
  Chelford treasure?"</p>

  <p>The horrible thing! It was behind all this misery; behind the killing of
  Thomas and the disappearance of Harry. She said as much, and Miss Wenner, not
  pausing in her typewriting, calmly expressed the view that it was very
  likely.</p>

  <p>Shock followed shock indeed! At half past four Leslie's maid brought a
  letter which had come by special delivery. It was in Arthur's writing; she
  tore it open and read:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Leslie,</p>

  <p class="letter">You are under no circumstances to marry Gilder. I refuse to
  allow you to sacrifice yourself for me, now or at any time. I am going away
  to France for a few months, and will return when things have blown
  over.</p><br>

  <p>Ordinarily quick-witted, it was a long time before Leslie could understand
  the significance of this message. When she did, she took the letter to Dick,
  and he read it without comment and handed it back to her.</p>

  <p>"What does that mean, Dick?"</p>

  <p>"It means that Arthur has taken the line of least resistance," he said.
  "To put it vulgarly, he has bolted!"</p>

  <p>Her heart sank, and in that moment she felt terribly alone. As if he read
  her thoughts, he went on:</p>

  <p>"He has certainly precipitated the crisis, but I don't see exactly how it
  will affect you. There was nothing else in the letter?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head and opened the envelope, and then saw a slip of paper
  which she had overlooked. It was an authority to sell his business, drawn up
  in legal form, and had evidently been added as an afterthought.</p>

  <p>"If there are no further defalcations, that ought to be worth something,"
  said Dick. "I'll see what I can do."</p>

  <p>But on this point she was firm.</p>

  <p>"I think you've enough trouble without mine," she said quietly. "Did you
  find anything in the ruins?"</p>

  <p>He started.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;no," he said, a little unconvincingly. "Did you see me go
  back?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I spied on you," she said, with a pathetic little smile.
  "Dick, I'm so worried about you; I wish you wouldn't go into these places
  alone."</p>

  <p>"There was nothing to fear," he said. "I thought I saw something on the
  floor which gave me a clue to Harry's fate, but it was nothing &mdash;
  nothing."</p>

  <p>He changed the subject abruptly. She had a feeling that he was not telling
  her all that he had seen.</p>

  <p>Mary and she had dinner alone, and Mr Glover, the butler, free from the
  restraining presence of Dick Alford, was inclined to be talkative.</p>

  <p>"There's no doubt Mr Alford looks after the policemen. I have had to get a
  food basket ready&mdash;thermos flask and everything the heart can desire.
  Personally, miss, I don't believe in pampering the police. They're only
  dissatisfied when they go back to their own homes. He won't have anybody take
  the basket down to them either. 'No,' he said, 'I'll take it myself. You have
  it ready at nine o'clock, put it just outside the servant's door.' My own
  opinion is that they'd be much more pleased with bread and cheese and a
  bottle of beer. What's the good of making chicken sandwiches for policemen?
  And having a bottle of the best wine up from the cellar! It's a waste of good
  food!"</p>

  <p>Leslie listened, petrified. Now she understood!</p>

  <p>The food was not for the police&mdash;it was for Harry! Harry, held
  prisoner in Chelford Abbey&mdash;by whom?</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch48"
     name="ch48"></a>CHAPTER XLVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE bane of life that day had been the London reporters. The
  Red Lion Inn at Chelfordbury was already filled with them, and not an hour
  passed that one did not make his way to the house in a vain endeavour to
  interview the second son. One intercepted him in Elm Drive, and to him, as to
  the rest, he gave the same reply.</p>

  <p>"You boys can't expect me to tell you any more than I already know," he
  said, at bay. "My brother has disappeared, but I believe he is still
  alive."</p>

  <p>"Who do you think is responsible for these outrages, Mr Alford?" asked the
  reporter.</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If I knew, it isn't reasonable to suppose that I should be discussing the
  matter with you."</p>

  <p>"Is it the Black Abbot?"</p>

  <p>"The Black Abbot has nothing whatever to do with this crime," said Dick
  shortly. "Unless I credit you with being so foolish as to believe in ghosts,
  it is unnecessary for me to tell you that there is no such thing as a Black
  Abbot, and the figure that has been seen in these grounds was somebody
  masquerading for his own purpose."</p>

  <p>"A practical joke?" suggested the newspaper man.</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it was a practical joke; indeed, I am sure there is
  something very serious behind it. But I can't tell you any more."</p>

  <p>"Mr Alford," said the reporter, "I'm going to ask you a very delicate
  question, and I hope you won't think it an impertinence. If your brother is
  dead, then the title comes to you, does it not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"You won't be offended if I tell you that there is a little talk in the
  village of some antagonism between your brother and you. I am told there have
  been frequent quarrels."</p>

  <p>Dick mastered his anger with a great effort, realising that the reporter
  was not intending to be impertinent, but simply epitomising the gossip of the
  countryside.</p>

  <p>"My brother was very nervous and quick-tempered," he said, "but I've never
  had a serious quarrel with him in my life."</p>

  <p>"Is it true that Lord Chelford's fiancée, Miss Leslie Gine, recently broke
  off her engagement with your brother?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly true," said Dick, stifling his impatience.</p>

  <p>"And yet she is staying at Fossaway Manor as your guest?" The keen eyes of
  the reporter were watching him closely. He saw the blood mount to his
  victim's cheeks and hastened to add: "I'm merely telling you what other
  people will tell you, Mr Alford. I have a much wider experience than you have
  of the uncharity and suspicion that surrounds every man associated with a
  crime like this. If you are annoyed with me I can understand it, but I can
  assure you that I only want to help you."</p>

  <p>"That I quite believe," said Dick with a smile. "But you can understand
  just how embarrassing your questions are. I will tell you the truth and you
  may put it into your paper. I am satisfied there is a very terrible danger
  overhanging Miss Leslie Gine, and it is for that reason, and that reason
  alone, I have asked her to stay at the Manor, which is under police
  protection and where I know she will be safe. Her brother has gone abroad,
  and I cannot allow her to stay at Willow House alone."</p>

  <p>"You mean she is in danger from the same person as killed Thomas the
  footman, and who is responsible for the disappearance of Lord Chelford?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded, and the newspaper man made a mental note.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said. "You will find that this little talk has cleared the
  air. In cases like this, if you clear up the minor mysteries as you go along,
  it makes for everybody's comfort."</p>

  <p>Dick, who had been trembling with anger through the interview, had to
  agree, in the calm moments which followed, that the reporter had taken a sane
  view of the matter. When he met Leslie a few minutes later, he told her of
  the interview. She was in the study alone, and had just finished writing a
  letter, which lay face downward on the blotting-pad. She saw him glance at
  the envelope and turned it up. It was addressed to Fabrian Gilder.</p>

  <p>"What have you said?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I've told him that I've considered the matter, and I've decided that I
  could not marry him&mdash;in any circumstances it would be impossible now, so
  soon after Harry's disappearance."</p>

  <p>He picked up the letter and, taking out his pocket-case, tore off a stamp
  and affixed it.</p>

  <p>"I'll see that this goes," he said grimly. Then, seeing her tired face:
  "Poor old girl, you're having a bad time."</p>

  <p>The pressure of her hand, the love and sympathy in her voice, were almost
  too much for him, and he had to set his teeth or he would have taken her in
  his arms and, in that place of tragedy and horror, told her of the love that
  was shaking him, and which had added a new and fearful burden to his
  overstrung nerves.</p>

  <p>"Go to bed early," he said, with an effort at gaiety, "and rise with the
  dawn. I shall be busy till very late."</p>

  <p>"The butler was telling me that you have ordered a basket of food for the
  policemen."</p>

  <p>Not a muscle of his face moved.</p>

  <p>"That is so; one or two men who are patrolling the cutting need a little
  light refreshment. They cannot get to the house and we haven't men to relieve
  them."</p>

  <p>She was sensible enough not to pursue the subject.</p>

  <p>It was only on her earnest entreaty that, as the night drew on, Mary
  Wenner remained. The girl was a bundle of nerves, started at every sound,
  paled and flushed with the opening of a door, and the sound of a falling
  plate in the servery whilst they were at dinner had made her scream.</p>

  <p>"I can't help it, my dear; I'm naturally temperamental," she explained.
  "And this house has got me shivering! I can't leave another young lady
  without a chaperone, or I'd fly off to London before it got dark."</p>

  <p>She had been in the library that afternoon, she told Leslie, and the sight
  of that familiar room with its empty chair had been almost the last
  straw.</p>

  <p>"I had to have a good cry," she confessed, "and I'm not ashamed of it.
  Harry was one of the best&mdash;you don't mind me calling him Harry, do you,
  dear?" And, when Leslie shook her head: "I can't say that I was fond of him
  as a young girl ought to be fond of a man she loves, but he was very nice. He
  had his tempers, the same as the rest of us, but they were only his high
  spirits. I could never understand why he hated Mr Alford."</p>

  <p>Leslie looked at her incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Hated Mr Alford?" she repeated. "Surely you're mistaken? They were very
  good friends."</p>

  <p>Mary shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, they weren't," she said. "It all arose out of her ladyship's
  picture."</p>

  <p>"The late Lady Chelford?"</p>

  <p>"That was the lady," nodded Mary. "It happened three years ago. Dick
  Alford suggested that the portrait should be moved to the gallery. I think he
  was silly to say it, knowing how Harry adored his mother, and when he said
  the picture was depressing&mdash;and that was the silliest thing of
  all&mdash;Harry got right up in the air! It was dreadful, the things he said
  to Mr Alford&mdash;and before me too! Dick Alford realised his mistake: I
  could see that, and he tried to pacify Harry, but for a fortnight they didn't
  speak."</p>

  <p>Leslie was silent. Slowly the inner life of Fossaway Manor was beginning
  to reveal itself to her; she had seen nothing of these cross-currents, had
  not suspected, even dimly, the conflicting antagonism which must have been
  visible to Harry Alford's secretary.</p>

  <p>"They were very friendly sometimes. You'd think that Harry was fond of
  him, and I think he was," Mary continued; "but the quarrels used to break out
  every now and then, once because Dick always stood with his back to the
  picture, and never looked at it at all. He hated it, I'm sure of that. Of
  course he never took me into his confidence. We were not what you might term
  good friends. I suppose it was foolish of me to take up Harry's quarrel, but
  I never liked Dick&mdash;you don't mind me calling him Dick?&mdash;after
  that."</p>

  <p>She glanced nervously through the window. The sun had set, and dusk was
  creeping over the great park.</p>

  <p>"If I get any sleep tonight I'll be lucky," she said. "Do you mind if I
  leave my door open and keep a light burning?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course not," smiled Leslie.</p>

  <p>"There is a lock on the door, and I asked Glover to find me the key," Miss
  Wenner went on. "And I'll tell you frankly, Leslie, that if he hadn't found
  it I wouldn't have stayed, not for all the money in the world."</p>

  <p>Leslie felt that it would be indiscreet to offer encouragement to a
  further discussion of this subject, for she was as reluctant to spend the
  night under that roof as her newfound friend.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch49"
     name="ch49"></a>CHAPTER XLIX</h2>

  <p class="first">THOUGH she waited up till nearly eleven, she did not see
  Dick, and, in response to the repeated hints of the other girl, they went
  upstairs together.</p>

  <p>The Manor was lighted by a power plant which was accommodated in a small
  shed midway between the house and the Ravensrill, and owed its installation
  to Dick's enterprise.</p>

  <p>Harry always had candles in his room, Mary told her, but accepted the
  lighting of his library as a compromise.</p>

  <p>"It's a very strange thing," said Mary from her inner room, "but Harry was
  afraid of electricity. In thunderstorms he always went down into the cellar
  and stayed there until they were over. He used to have a bed which was made
  every day in the summer, in case of a storm coming on in the night,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At that moment all the lights in the room went out.</p>

  <p>"Have you turned the lights off?" asked Mary's anxious voice.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't been near the switch; I expect a fuse has gone," said the
  girl.</p>

  <p>There were matches and candles on the dressing-table, she remembered, and,
  groping her way to the table, she lit the two candles. Mary was standing in
  the doorway, very pale and wide-eyed.</p>

  <p>"What was the meaning of that?" she asked, her voice sharp with fear,
  which was beginning to communicate itself to Leslie.</p>

  <p>She forced a smile.</p>

  <p>"That happens in the best-regulated houses," she said, with spurious
  gaiety. "The door is locked, so there's nothing to be afraid of."</p>

  <p>And then she heard footsteps in the corridor; there was a knock at the
  door that made Mary jump.</p>

  <p>"Are you there, Leslie?" It was Dick's voice. "Something has gone wrong
  with the lighting arrangements; we'll put it right in a minute or two."</p>

  <p>"Are the lights out everywhere?" asked Mary, but he was gone.</p>

  <p>Twenty minutes passed and again Leslie heard his footsteps
  approaching.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we shan't be able to fix up the lights till the morning. Have
  you candles? Did Glover put a flashlight for you?"</p>

  <p>"We've everything we want," said Leslie. "Don't worry about us: we shall
  be asleep in ten minutes."</p>

  <p>"Not me," murmured Miss Wenner tremulously. "I shan't sleep a wink!"</p>

  <p>By the light of her candle she had replaced most of the garments she had
  discarded when the lights went out.</p>

  <p>"I knew I oughtn't to have stayed&mdash;there's somebody coming along the
  corridor!"</p>

  <p>"It is only Mr Alford."</p>

  <p>But her ears caught the sound of two pairs of feet, and presently Dick's
  voice spoke.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I leave one of Puttler's men outside your door?" he asked.
  "Don't be alarmed if you hear him walking about in the night."</p>

  <p>"Is anything wrong, Dick?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, nothing wrong; only I knew Miss Wenner was rather nervous."</p>

  <p>"I am," quavered Miss Wenner loudly. "It's very good of you, Mr
  Alford."</p>

  <p>"You had better keep your windows fastened," said Dick. "There is a system
  of ventilation in the rooms, so you needn't be afraid of waking with a
  headache. Good night."</p>

  <p>When he had gone, Mary Wenner looked solemnly at her companion.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear what he said about keeping the windows shut?" she asked
  hollowly. "My Gawd!"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, Mary."</p>

  <p>The girl was past feeling comfortable, but she had need to set an
  example.</p>

  <p>"Come along, I'll help you fasten the windows."</p>

  <p>"'Keep the windows fastened,'" repeated Mary Wenner. "There's something
  doing!"</p>

  <p>They went from one to the other of the leaded windows, closed them and
  pressed down the catches. Suddenly Mary clutched the girl's arm fiercely.</p>

  <p>"There's a man under my bed!" she gasped, staring wildly at the drooping
  counterpane.</p>

  <p>With a fluttering heart Leslie lifted the cover, and pulled out a pair of
  riding boots, the soles of which the frightened girl had seen, and they both
  laughed hysterically.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could bring my bed into your room." Mary looked helplessly at
  the heavy four-poster to which she had been assigned.</p>

  <p>"You can come and sleep with me," said Leslie. "I've got a big bed." And
  this offer was most gratefully accepted.</p>

  <p>"Have a look under your bed first," said Miss Wenner nervously, and not
  till this ritual had been observed did she commence very slowly to
  undress.</p>

  <p>Down below in the library, Dick was in consultation with Puttler, who had
  just returned from a hasty visit to Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"The batteries were smashed, and an attempt had been made to cut the main
  cable," reported Dick. "I got to the power house just after it happened, but
  I saw nobody."</p>

  <p>Puttler pulled at his comic little nose and there was a look of trouble in
  his brown eyes.</p>

  <p>"The Commissioner thinks you ought to have a dozen men down here and make
  a clean-up," he said. "I've brought three, and I think they all ought to be
  inside the house. One we've got in the east wing, another in the west, and a
  patrol in the hall. That will leave you and me and the local 'flatties' for
  the grounds. Though I think we might as well stay here&mdash;you want a
  battalion to patrol the estate properly. By the way, when I was looking round
  early this morning I found a great mound of earth in the north-east corner of
  the estate, near the river. One of your gamekeepers told me it was called
  Chelford Greed. What is the idea?"</p>

  <p>Dick was not in an archaeological mood, but he explained.</p>

  <p>"One of my ancestors&mdash;I don't know which one&mdash;planned and
  carried out a big steal. You probably know that the charter by which we
  received these lands from King Henry confines the northern boundary of the
  estate to the course of the Ravensrill, and the ingenious Chelford of the
  times had the idea of changing the course of the Ravensrill so that the
  estate would embrace another thousand acres. The Chelford Greed was the dam
  he built. The natural course of the Ravensrill runs through the Long Meadow.
  It was one of those clever little pieces of robbery that has made us landed
  proprietors what we are! As I say, I don't know which of the Chelfords
  planned this piece of larceny, because there is no written record, and the
  legend has come down from mouth to mouth, so to speak."</p>

  <p>He looked up at the big portrait above the fireplace and shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"Lady," he said softly, "you've given me a lot of trouble!"</p>

  <p>Puttler was interested.</p>

  <p>"As how?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you one of these days," said Dick. "I wonder if those girls are
  asleep?"</p>

  <p>He stole quietly up the stairs. The man on duty in the corridor flashed a
  lamp upon him as he approached.</p>

  <p>"No sound," he whispered, and Dick crept downstairs again.</p>

  <p>It was arranged that he and Puttler should snatch a few hours' sleep in
  turn, the other patrolling round and round the block of buildings. At two
  o'clock in the morning Dick was aroused from a deep slumber to feel Puttler
  gently shaking at his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Nothing has happened," said the detective, eyeing with a friendly look
  the sofa from which Dick struggled. "I've warmed up some grub for you."</p>

  <p>A spirit stove was burning on the desk and the kettle above was steaming.
  Dick poured the black coffee into a cup and scalded himself to
  wakefulness.</p>

  <p>"One of the local men thought he saw somebody moving and challenged,"
  reported Puttler, settling himself down with a luxurious sigh. "But it was
  probably only a bush. These birds are jumpy&mdash;they see a Black Abbot in
  every shadow!"</p>

  <p>Dick sipped at the boiling fluid and broke a biscuit with his disengaged
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Thank God this can't go on much longer!" he said. "By the way, did you
  bring those papers from London?"</p>

  <p>"I gave them to you in the library: they were in the blue envelope."</p>

  <p>Dick put down the glass.</p>

  <p>"I'd better keep them in my safe," he said. "I don't want the servants to
  see them."</p>

  <p>He crossed the hall, unlocked the door of the library and went in,
  mechanically switching on the light, and only then remembering that for the
  time being Fossaway Manor was denied the service of the little power house.
  He went back to the study and got his lamp and picked his way across the room
  to the desk. The envelope was where he had put it, and he slipped this into
  his pocket. As he did so, he was aware that a cold wind was blowing. He sent
  his light along the windows. That at the end was open; one of the curtains,
  which had been drawn across, lay in a heap on the floor.</p>

  <p>He went to the door and called Puttler softly and the detective joined
  him.</p>

  <p>"Somebody has been here," he said, and pointed to the curtain and the
  twisted pole that had supported it.</p>

  <p>It was easy to see how the intruder had made his way into the library. Two
  of the panes near the iron handle which fastened one leaf of the window had
  been broken, and evidently the midnight visitor, in entering, must have
  fallen and, catching hold of the curtain to save himself, brought it to the
  ground, breaking away the pole, which was hanging drunkenly.</p>

  <p>"I passed here ten minutes ago, and the window was shut then," said
  Puttler.</p>

  <p>"He may have been inside at the moment," replied Dick thoughtfully. "I
  wonder what has been taken?"</p>

  <p>He examined the desk. Evidently the intruder had not opened any of the
  drawers, though, if he had done so, his labours would have been in vain,
  since Dick had cleared every document out of the room early in the day. As
  they circled the room, Puttler stumbled over something.</p>

  <p>"Where did this come from?" he asked.</p>

  <p>It was a light ladder, and Dick recognised it as one of two that were part
  of the library furniture, and were employed to reach books from the top shelf
  of the lower tier.</p>

  <p>"When I saw this last it was standing at the end of the room," he
  said.</p>

  <p>He flashed his lamp up on to the shelves, looking for a gap in the long
  line of books. So doing, his lamp swept across that space intervening between
  the shelves which was covered by the portrait of the late Lady Chelford. He
  could see the big gold frame, caught a glimpse of one white hand hanging
  gracefully, and then something brought his lamp back. He heard the
  churchwarden detective swear softly. Himself, he was speechless. The light of
  his lamp focussed on the place where the woman's face had been, and where now
  was a black emptiness.</p>

  <p>The face and shoulders of the picture had been cut from the frame, and the
  ragged strands of canvas told him that it had been cut by an unskilful
  hand.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch50"
     name="ch50"></a>CHAPTER L</h2>

  <p class="first">NEITHER man spoke until they were back in the little study,
  and then Puttler looked gloomily at his companion.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of that?"</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows!" groaned Dick.</p>

  <p>The study door was closed, and he had pulled across a dark curtain which
  had been hung that day for the purpose.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I'd better get out, though I don't suppose I shall find
  anything."</p>

  <p>"Wait until I've had the remainder of your coffee and I'll come with you,"
  said Puttler. "No, Mr Alford, I never felt less like sleep. We shall have
  daylight in a couple of hours. Wait."</p>

  <p>He turned down the oil lamp which had been requisitioned from the kitchen,
  blew down the glass chimney and the room was in darkness.</p>

  <p>"Now you can pull open those curtains and go out," he said, "if that is
  your way."</p>

  <p>Dick moved the curtains slightly and looked out. The world lay peaceful,
  silent, in the pallid light of the moon, and as he opened the door, the sweet
  scent of the earth and the cold morn greeted him fragrantly.</p>

  <p>His foot was raised to step across the threshold when Puttler's big hand
  closed round his arm.</p>

  <p>"Wait," he whispered again.</p>

  <p>Dick stood motionless.</p>

  <p>"I see nothing," he said in the same tone.</p>

  <p>Still Puttler held him, his head bent, listening.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, released his grip and stepped out on to the little
  terrace before Dick.</p>

  <p>He gave a swift glance left and right.</p>

  <p>"What was it?" asked Dick, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Somebody breathing," was Puttler's astonishing reply. "You won't believe
  that I could hear a man breathing a dozen yards away, but I can. It's one of
  my many animal qualities."</p>

  <p>He took a little run, cleared the gravel path in a bound and went
  noiselessly along the grass to the left. Presently Dick saw him returning at
  a jog-trot. The detective went past him and disappeared round the wing of the
  block. In a few minutes he returned.</p>

  <p>"Hearing and scent are my two qualities. Can you smell anything?"</p>

  <p>Dick sniffed the morning air.</p>

  <p>"No," he confessed.</p>

  <p>"Come along with me."</p>

  <p>This time he walked softly across the path, explaining that he was afraid
  of waking the girls, who slept almost immediately above them.</p>

  <p>They went to the end of the wing, and then the sergeant halted.</p>

  <p>"Now do you smell anything?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Dick sniffed again. There was a sweet odour in the air, the scent of some
  exotic flower that seemed familiar to him.</p>

  <p>"Does anybody in this house smoke scented cigarettes?" asked the
  detective, and Dick went suddenly cold.</p>

  <p>"Harry!"</p>

  <p>"Your brother, eh?" Puttler's deep-set eyes surveyed him in the half-
  light. "That doesn't necessarily mean that he is smoking them. Where were
  they kept?"</p>

  <p>"In the library as a rule."</p>

  <p>Puttler began searching the ground with the aid of his lamp. He had not
  gone far before he saw something and picked it up. It was a half-smoked
  cigarette with a rose-leaf tip.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" muttered Puttler, and continued his search&mdash;a search which
  yielded no further evidence.</p>

  <p>Retracing their steps, they passed the study door, and Puttler, who was
  walking a little ahead, stumbled over something, and put his light to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"You keep rather a lot of ladders about here, Mr Alford," he said, in a
  low voice. "A library ladder outside? What's the great idea?"</p>

  <p>The ladder was lying parallel with the gravel drive, and Puttler examined
  it rung by rung.</p>

  <p>"That wasn't here last night, I'll take my oath," he said.</p>

  <p>"No," said Dick, puzzled; "it usually hangs on two pegs near the
  garage."</p>

  <p>He lifted it up. It was a long, light, triangular ladder tapering to a
  point at the top, and used by the staff for outside window cleaning.</p>

  <p>"You had better have it chained up," was all Puttler said after he had
  finished his inspection. "The man who brought this here was the man who cut
  off your light supply, and, incidentally&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Far away in the grounds came the faint sound of a man's voice, challenging
  in military fashion.</p>

  <p>"Halt! Who goes there?"</p>

  <p>"That's Renwick, a local man," said Puttler immediately.</p>

  <p>They ran towards the sound of the voice, and presently saw the flicker of
  his lantern; and it was a badly scared man who challenged them a few minutes
  later. He had seen nothing, he said, but he had heard voices.</p>

  <p>"One of them was laughing. I thought at first it was you, sergeant, but
  when I heard it again it was so wild that I got a little nervous."</p>

  <p>"Did anybody answer your challenge?"</p>

  <p>"No, but the voices stopped. I couldn't hear the woman's voice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The woman's voice?" said Dick quickly. "Was it a woman? Surely you're
  mistaken?"</p>

  <p>"I could swear to it," said the watcher. "It was the woman's voice I heard
  first, and the man who laughed. I think the voices must have stopped as soon
  as I put my lamp on."</p>

  <p>"In what direction?"</p>

  <p>The policeman pointed across Long Meadow, the shallow, valley-like
  depression which ran parallel with the rising ground on which the abbey
  stood. To the left there were a number of cottages, occupied in the main by
  people working on the estate, two gamekeepers, a carter and a groom. It was
  from one of these cottages that the Black Abbot had been seen and reported by
  a terrified gamekeeper.</p>

  <p>"They sounded as if they were walking away from you over the Mound to the
  river&mdash;or to the ruins?" suggested Puttler.</p>

  <p>"Well," confessed the man, "they might have been going that way: I can't
  be sure."</p>

  <p>"That certainly beats the band," said the sergeant, as they were moving in
  the direction the man had indicated.</p>

  <p>"He must have been mistaken," said Dick with emphasis. "They were walking
  away from him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They," repeated Puttler significantly. "I don't think he was wrong at
  all."</p>

  <p>"There is another possible solution," said Dick. "Sometimes the people at
  Chelfordbury avail themselves of a short cut across the park to a
  neighbouring village."</p>

  <p>"At three o'clock in the morning?"</p>

  <p>"There may have been a dance," suggested Dick lamely.</p>

  <p>"A short cut through a park that's known to be haunted and where a murder
  was committed two nights ago?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer to this.</p>

  <p>They reached the bank and followed along the top till they were parallel
  with the abbey, but there was no sign of man or woman, and they turned back.
  In spite of his protestations of wakefulness, Sergeant Puttler did not resist
  the suggestion that he should take his sleep. Dick was left alone to his
  vigil.</p>

  <p>By the time daylight came he was a very weary man. Twice in the night he
  had visited the two men posted in the corridors above, found them awake, but
  in each case with nothing to report.</p>

  <p>"Thank goodness at any rate somebody's had some sleep!" he muttered, as he
  passed under the girls' window and glanced up.</p>

  <p>The morning wind which stirred the trees and filled the world with the
  pleasant music of rustling leaves moved also the casement window of the room
  which he had assigned to Mary Wenner. The window swayed to and fro slowly,
  and he inwardly condemned the girl for not carrying out his instructions.</p>

  <p>By six o'clock the first of the servants was stirring; smoke was crawling
  lazily from one of the big twisted chimneys. He was sitting in envious
  contemplation of Sergeant Puttler when the door of the study burst violently
  open and Mary Wenner came in. She was in her dressing gown; her untidy hair
  floated over her face.</p>

  <p>"Mr Alford," she asked agitatedly, "have you seen Leslie?"</p>

  <p>He was on his feet in an instant, and the movement woke the sleeping
  detective.</p>

  <p>"No; she's with you, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"We went to bed together," said the girl, in a tremulous tone, "but when I
  woke up just now she was not in the room. I waited a while, thinking she was
  taking her bath, and then I went outside and asked the man you put there. He
  said she hadn't come out of the room!"</p>

  <p>Puttler, listening, dragged himself erect.</p>

  <p>"The ladder!" he said simply, and Dick reeled under the blow.</p>

  <p>The Black Terror of Fossaway Manor had in his grip the woman for whom he
  would have given his soul and counted it no heavy price.</p>

  <p>Running out on to the lawn, Puttler searched beneath the window. Yes,
  there were the marks of the ladder in the mould of a garden bed, and on the
  ladder itself he found confirmatory proof. Lifting it against the wall, he
  scrambled up, and came breast-high to the window sill on its topmost rung.
  Drawing himself up, he sprang into the room and looked round for some clue.
  By this time Mary Wenner, followed by Dick, had come through the door.</p>

  <p>"Her dressing-gown isn't gone!" whimpered Mary, pointing to the hook where
  it hung. "But her shoes are. She must have dressed, and I didn't hear."</p>

  <p>The tired man at the door had heard no sound in the night. A thick carpet
  covered the floor. Mary said that, when she woke, the door which communicated
  between the two rooms was closed.</p>

  <p>She had heard no sound at all, and claimed that she was a light sleeper,
  which, in fact, she was not. When she had gone to sleep the candle was
  burning. Examining this, Dick saw that it could not have been alight for more
  than an hour. There were two burnt matches in the tray, which meant that the
  candle had been extinguished once and relit again.</p>

  <p>"I wonder she didn't wake me; I'm usually a light sleeper."</p>

  <p>Dick left the girl explaining to the watcher who had been on guard outside
  the door.</p>

  <p>"It was her voice, of course, that the patrol man heard in the dark. I
  blame myself that I didn't jump at that idea."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to keep all the blame!" said Dick bitterly. "Oh, God! it doesn't
  bear thinking about!"</p>

  <p>He went away on a solitary search; none saw him slip through the back of
  the house, and he moved under cover of the river bank. When he returned,
  after an absence of two hours, Puttler told him that there was a message from
  the Home Office awaiting him. That institution had rung up twice. Dick got
  through after a wait, and learned that he was talking to an important under-
  secretary.</p>

  <p>"Could you run up to London for an hour?"</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary?" asked Dick, and he explained with all rapidity the
  happenings of the night.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you had better see us as soon as you possibly can. In view of
  all the circumstances you cannot come too soon."</p>

  <p>With a curse Dick hung up the receiver, and this time he took Harry's big
  two-seater, a car that his brother had only used a dozen times, but the use
  of which he had steadfastly refused to anybody else.</p>

  <p>Just as he was leaving he recalled a resolution he had made in the night;
  he ran upstairs into his room, and, bolting the door, opened a locked drawer
  of his dressing chest and took out something which he put carefully in his
  bag. That must be removed from Fossaway Manor as soon as possible, he
  thought. He put the bag in the boot of the car and sent the machine flying
  down the drive.</p>

  <p>Midway between Horsham and Dorking, a motorist, coming from the opposite
  direction by another route, shot at a fast pace from a forked road right
  across his path. Dick jammed on the brakes and the big car skidded halfway
  round, striking the concrete kerb with a thud, but no damage was done, and he
  went on, with a glare at the goggled driver of the machine at fault that was
  murderous.</p>

  <p>He did not hear the cover of the dickey snap open, nor did he see the
  brown bag leap up and roll over on to the pavement. But the man in the other
  car saw all this through his big goggles, and, restarting his machine,
  brought it to the kerb.</p>

  <p>And there and then, Fabrian Gilder discovered the secret of the Black
  Abbot!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch51"
     name="ch51"></a>CHAPTER LI</h2>

  <p class="first">AT nine o'clock that morning Mr Fabrian Gilder had risen
  intending to make a hurried visit to his country cottage. The newspapers had
  been full of the Chelford tragedy, but no mention had been made of the fact
  that Thomas had been Mr Gilder's guest. Such a happening, he realised, being
  an intelligent man, must necessarily upset all arrangements and plans that
  the girl had made.</p>

  <p>There was a lot about Fabrian Gilder that was admirable. To his servants
  he was a kind master; to all who knew him superficially, an excellent and
  even a generous friend. He was in truth no worse than the average man in
  point of desires, a little better in his fairness of dealing. Arthur Gine had
  been legitimate prey, but he had, he thought, treated him with scrupulous
  fairness. He had succeeded, by the exploitation of the lawyer's weakness, in
  amassing a very considerable fortune; but then, the city of London, and, for
  the matter of that, the city of New York, were filled with rich men who had
  founded their houses upon the cupidity or folly of men who were now almost
  penniless.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the morning papers. There was nothing new reported from
  Chelford, except the little interview that one reporter had had with Dick,
  and that paragraph was, in many ways, very comforting to Gilder, for it
  explained why the girl&mdash;and then his eye caught sight of a line.</p>

  <p class="note">Mr Alford said he had asked Miss Leslie Gine to stay at
  Fossaway Manor whilst her brother was abroad...</p>

  <p>Abroad? He frowned. If Arthur Gine had gone abroad he must have left very
  suddenly. He had seen him only a day or two before. But perhaps that was one
  of Dick Alford's lies to save the girl's face. Still, it was disquieting.</p>

  <p>He was pondering this matter when the maid brought him his morning
  letters, and the first he saw was one in a well-known hand. It was from
  Leslie. He tore it open with trembling fingers, took out the half-sheet of
  paper and read the few lines. He read it not once but many times. So that was
  that! She had changed her mind.</p>

  <p>It did not occur to him that she had not made any promise, but he was so
  sure of her, so satisfied in his mind that she would agree to his proposal,
  that he felt he had been tricked.</p>

  <p>When the shock had worn off, his anger and resentment grew. Very well: if
  she could not keep her promise, he at least would keep his. He understood
  now, he thought. Arthur had bolted, and there was no necessity for the girl
  to make her sacrifice. He had been fooled, tricked. He pushed the chair back
  from the table, leaving his breakfast untouched, and, going into his library,
  turned the handle of the combination and pulled open the door of the safe
  with a savage jerk. There was the letter, all ready to post, and at the sight
  of it his heart grew hard and sour.</p>

  <p>He took out the letter, made to tear it into fragments, and then
  remembered that inside was a blank cheque. He pulled out the sheet of
  notepaper and felt for the little pink slip that in his magnificence he had
  signed with a complacent flourish. It was not there!</p>

  <p>Gilder peered into the envelope with a frown. Gone! He searched the safe:
  it might have fallen out, though how, he could not imagine; but there was no
  sign of the cheque. He unlocked his drawer and took out his cheque-book.
  There was the counterfoil, and, written across it, "For Leslie&mdash;" He had
  intended showing her that counterfoil one of these days, when she felt more
  kindly towards him.</p>

  <p>With his head in his hands he tried to remember when he had last seen the
  cheque, and then he recalled that it was on the morning Arthur Gine had
  called to see him. At that thought he went white. Surely he had closed the
  safe? Again he struggled to remember, minute by minute, that fateful morning.
  He had been looking at the letter, he had put it away, he had closed the
  door, and then&mdash;the telephone bell had rung and he had forgotten to
  fasten the safe!</p>

  <p>He pulled the phone towards him now and called furiously for a number. It
  was twenty past nine; most of the staff of the bank would be there. When the
  call was answered: "I am Mr Gilder," he said quickly. "Is the manager
  there?&mdash;No? Then the assistant manager will do. It is very urgent."</p>

  <p>He waited whilst the clerk went to investigate. Presently he heard the
  voice of a man he knew&mdash;the manager himself.</p>

  <p>"I just came in at this moment. Is anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Fletcher, do you remember my telling you that I should be sending down a
  cheque for fifty thousand pounds and asking you to honour it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I honoured it."</p>

  <p>For a second Gilder was speechless.</p>

  <p>"You honoured it? Who presented the cheque?"</p>

  <p>"Arthur Gine&mdash;it was made out in his favour&mdash;payable to bearer.
  I notified you last night; didn't you get my letter?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't opened all my post yet," said Gilder steadily. "Thank you."</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver, breathing heavily. For now he remembered clearly
  every event of the morning: the coming of Arthur Gine, and his seemingly
  absurd proposal, that Gilder should write a note expressing his willingness
  to lend the money. That was the trick of it! Not only had Arthur got the
  fifty thousand, but with that letter he had a complete answer to any charge
  of fraud.</p>

  <p>He sat with clasped hands, every vein on his forehead swollen, and murder
  in his heart. Tricked! And she should know. She had been a party to the
  fraud&mdash;unwittingly perhaps, but nevertheless a party. She must have told
  him of this money.</p>

  <p>Whatever else he was, Fabrian Gilder had the gift of clear thinking. Five
  minutes' riotous fury, and he was his cold self again. Of course she couldn't
  have helped in the fraud. It was the accident of leaving the safe unlocked,
  and Arthur Gine's known inquisitiveness&mdash;he could never resist reading
  even Gilder's private letters; Arthur had no sense of other people's
  privacy.</p>

  <p>What could he do now? He thought the matter out. He must tell the girl,
  and perhaps she would regard herself as being under an obligation to him. If
  she had any sense of honour she must fulfil her promise, whatever she had
  written in her letter that morning.</p>

  <p>He telephoned for his car to be brought round from the garage, and came
  back to his breakfast table and made an attempt to eat.</p>

  <p>He would try Leslie first, telling her nothing about the letter he had
  given to her brother, and threaten him with a warrant for fraud. Perhaps this
  strengthened rather than weakened his position. He grew cheerful as the
  thought took shape.</p>

  <p>He passed slowly out of London, for all the streets in the metropolis
  seemed to be "up," and at last struck the open country, avoiding the main
  roads and taking a more circuitous route which would bring him to the main
  Sussex road between Dorking and Horsham. With a clear road before him, he
  sent his car at full speed. He was not well acquainted with the road, but he
  knew that it joined the old Roman "street" at a gentle angle, and he did not
  slow down as he approached the principal thoroughfare.</p>

  <p>Left of him, on the London side, the road was clear; to the right, the
  view was a little obstructed. He sounded his klaxon and came out on to the
  main thoroughfare at thirty miles an hour.</p>

  <p>He saw the car just in time, jammed on his brakes and threw the machine
  into reverse. The big car ahead of him skidded round; he caught one
  malevolent gleam from Dick Alford's eyes, and then he saw the bag and,
  driving to the side of the road, picked it up. His first inclination was to
  leave it; he had no particular desire to help the second son; but there are
  certain innate decencies to be observed by motorists, even though they loathe
  each other, and he picked the little bag from the pavement and threw it into
  the back of his car.</p>

  <p>As he did so, it opened, and, turning to fasten it, he saw something that
  made him change his mind. Getting out of the car, he lifted the bag to the
  pavement, opened it wide and pulled out&mdash;the sombre habit and cowl of
  the Black Abbot!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch52"
     name="ch52"></a>CHAPTER LII</h2>

  <p class="first">SO Dick Alford was the Black Abbot! It was unbelievable; he
  could hardly credit the importance of his find. Here, then, was the greatest
  lever of all. Beside this, the threat of a charge against Leslie Gine's
  brother faded to unimportance. He snapped the lock, put the bag carefully
  back in the car, and, restarting his engine, moved at a slower pace towards
  Chelfordbury.</p>

  <p>He stopped in the village, where he was recognised, and heard at first
  hand from the innkeeper the story of the strange happenings at the "big
  house."</p>

  <p>"They do say that something's happened to the young lady from Willow
  House."</p>

  <p>"What!" Gilder almost shouted the word. "You don't mean Miss Gine?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss Gine," nodded the landlord. "I haven't got the rights of it
  yet, it's only a rumour down here, but, Lord bless your heart, Mr Gilder,
  there's never been so many rumours in this village since I came to live here
  forty-eight years ago. Some say that his lordship's been murdered"&mdash;he
  lowered his voice and looked round&mdash;"by his brother! Mr Alford is a very
  hard man, though the people who work for him have got nothing to say against
  him, but that doesn't seem possible to me."</p>

  <p>Gilder's mind was in a whirl. He did not want to know anything about Dick
  Alford or his reputation.</p>

  <p>"Who told you this story about Miss Gine?" he asked, and the landlord,
  looking round the group that had formed outside the Red Lion, pointed to a
  man.</p>

  <p>"He's a carter up at the big house," he said.</p>

  <p>"Fetch him here," said Gilder.</p>

  <p>When the carter arrived: "What is this story about Miss Gine?"</p>

  <p>The man looked a little sheepish to find himself the centre of
  interest.</p>

  <p>"I don't know nowt about it," he said. "It's only what I heerd that
  monkey-faced gentleman saying to Mr Richard. He says, 'I don't think any
  harm's come to her.' And one of the maids says that that young lady who used
  to be his lordship's secretary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Miss Wenner? Is she there?" asked Gilder quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she come up last night."</p>

  <p>"What about her?" asked Gilder.</p>

  <p>"They say she's been crying her eyes out all the morning. That's all I
  know about it. They do say something bad happened to the young lady early
  this morning, and the way Mr Richard has been running about and him looking
  as ill as death&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I hope something's going to be done about this Black Abbot," interjected
  the innkeeper. "My womenfolk are so frightened they want to sit up half the
  night."</p>

  <p>Gilder looked at him with a queer expression.</p>

  <p>"You needn't be afraid of the Black Abbot," he said. "I am going to lay
  that ghost today."</p>

  <p>"You, Mr Gilder?" said the man, in surprise.</p>

  <p>But it was not the occasion for confidences, and Gilder, getting back into
  his car, turned it about and went up the road till he came to the lodge
  gates. Here a policeman on duty would have barred his progress, but
  fortunately he was a local man who knew the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"Mr Alford's away, sir. Do you want to see Sergeant Puttler?"</p>

  <p>"Is that the man who has been staying at the Manor? What is he&mdash;a
  policeman?"</p>

  <p>"A Scotland Yard man, sir," said the Sussex policeman, with a certain
  pride. "Though I don't know they're much better than our own detectives.
  You'll tell him you saw me, will you, and I asked you not to go to the house
  unless you had business?"</p>

  <p>Evidently these were the policeman's instructions; Gilder promised
  faithfully to supply this exoneration, and continued up the drive. There was
  nobody to meet him when he pulled up before the old carved porch, but he had
  hardly alighted when a long-armed, queer-faced man came from nowhere.</p>

  <p>"Good morning," said the visitor.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr Gilder," said Puttler. "Mr Alford has had to go to
  town."</p>

  <p>"I want to see Miss Gine," said Gilder, watching the man closely.</p>

  <p>If he had expected an experienced detective-sergeant to betray himself, he
  was to be disappointed. Puttler did no more than fix him with his melancholy
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Want to see Miss Gine, do you? I'm afraid she's not at home either."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps I could see Miss Wenner?"</p>

  <p>The sergeant scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"She's not very well," he said; "in fact, she's lying down, and the doctor
  says she's not to be disturbed."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything wrong with her?"</p>

  <p>"No, there's nothing very much wrong with her. At the same time," said
  Puttler juridically, "there's nothing very much right with her! It has rather
  got on her nerves sleeping in this place, and I can't very well blame
  her."</p>

  <p>"Do you know where Miss Gine has gone?"</p>

  <p>Puttler shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, truthfully, "I can't tell you that; she didn't tell
  me."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will answer this question," said the exasperated man: "has
  anything happened to her?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I know," said the imperturbable officer, "nothing whatever has
  happened to her. Are you a friend of hers?"</p>

  <p>"I am her fiancé," said Gilder, on the spur of the moment.</p>

  <p>Here he had the satisfaction of seeing that the sergeant was startled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, of course, you're the gentleman she isn't going to marry."</p>

  <p>It was said in all innocence, without any trace of impertinence, but Mr
  Gilder went red and white.</p>

  <p>"You see, Mr Gilder," the sergeant went on, "I've heard quite a lot
  about&mdash;affairs in this neighbourhood; in fact, I'm an authority upon all
  the gossip and scandal for the past twenty years. And I'm very glad you came,
  because there are one or two questions I wanted to ask you. For example, I
  wanted to know how it came about that you placed your cottage at the disposal
  of an ex-convict, Thomas Luck&mdash;so called."</p>

  <p>But here Gilder was ready with his answer.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea the man was an ex-convict," he said. "He told me he had
  been discharged from the Manor, and as I wanted a caretaker, and he offered
  to come for a very small sum, I employed him. I was terribly surprised and
  shocked to hear of his death, but even more shocked to learn of his
  character."</p>

  <p>Puttler was politely interested. But if he thought that he was going to
  get rid of Gilder so easily, it was because he did not know the man's
  pertinacity.</p>

  <p>"I think I must see Miss Wenner before I go," he said. "At any rate, I'd
  be glad if you'd send up my name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Puttler shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It can't be done, Mr Gilder," he said, almost cheerfully. "Just now I'm a
  combination of the Earl of Chelford and the family doctor. In other words,
  I'm in charge during Mr Alford's absence. If you care to wait until he comes
  back, the drawing-room is at your disposal, but you understand, Mr Gilder,
  that you are not in any circumstances to question the servants. I am a great
  admirer of amateur detectives in my leisure moments, but this is one of my
  busy days, and I can't afford to have any interference in this case, however
  well-meant it may be."</p>

  <p>Gilder had to accept this invitation. He was determined not to leave the
  house until he had learned the truth about Leslie Gine. The detective
  conducted him to the drawing-room, the long windows of which were open.</p>

  <p>"I'll ask you not to leave here until Mr Alford arrives," he said. "If you
  require anything, perhaps you will ring?" And, seeing the light in Gilder's
  eyes, he added: "One of my men, who is a first-class footman, will attend to
  you."</p>

  <p>He had not long to wait, as it happened. Dick, who had torn up to town,
  breaking every speed rule, and so intent upon the object of his visit that he
  had forgotten even that he had put the bag in the dickey, was lucky enough to
  get through with his interview in a quarter of an hour. It was a very
  important interview: one on which his own future very largely depended; and
  there were too many things to think about for him to give a thought to the
  bag and its contents. His car, white with dust, sped up the drive and came to
  a halt in the wide space before the porch. He identified the other car and
  recognised it as the machine that had nearly brought about a nasty accident
  that morning.</p>

  <p>"Gilder, is it?" he said, as he got down.</p>

  <p>"Gilder it is, and full of interrogation marks. You saw the
  Secretary?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He was very kind, but rather vague. He has given me twelve hours to
  find Harry, dead or alive."</p>

  <p>"Did you tell him about Miss Gine?"</p>

  <p>"He wasn't even interested," said Dick, with a hard laugh. "Harry, the
  estate, the title&mdash;everything except Leslie! That was the burden of his
  conversation. In twelve hours I must find him&mdash;and believe me, Puttler,
  in twelve hours I will!"</p>

  <p>He went into the drawing-room and greeted Gilder curtly.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to see me?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted to know what has happened to Leslie Gine," said Gilder.</p>

  <p>"I wish to God I knew!" said Dick.</p>

  <p>The man stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Nothing bad has happened?" he asked in a low voice, and Dick forgave him
  everything for the sincerity of his concern.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it is something very unpleasant," he said, and told the
  story.</p>

  <p>As he did so, he saw the man's face change and a sceptical smile curved
  his lips.</p>

  <p>"I've got something to say to you, and I'd like to say it before a
  witness, Alford."</p>

  <p>"To me?" said Dick, in surprise, and called over his shoulder to Puttler,
  who was passing the door. "Mr Gilder has something he wants to say&mdash;I
  presume it's something of an unpleasant character," he said. "Perhaps you had
  better listen to this, Puttler."</p>

  <p>"Alford has just told me that Miss Gine has disappeared, and the inference
  is, of course, that the Black Abbot has spirited her away. I think that is
  extremely likely, because the Black Abbot has every interest in holding fast
  to that young lady."</p>

  <p>"Sensation," murmured the detective, but Gilder did not notice the
  interruption.</p>

  <p>"For some time past there's been a queer spook haunting this countryside,
  an object of terror to Lord Chelford, designed, if anything, to cover the
  series of outrages which have recently been committed. Chelford's a
  weakling&mdash;you know that, Alford&mdash;but weaklings have children, and
  once a child is born to Harry Alford your hope of succession would go like
  that!" He snapped his fingers.</p>

  <p>"What are you suggesting?" asked Dick steadily.</p>

  <p>"I'm suggesting that you are the Black Abbot!"</p>

  <p>Not by so much as a flicker of his eyelid did Dick betray himself.</p>

  <p>"I not only suggest it, but I'm prepared to prove it. On your way to town
  this morning you nearly collided with my car. As you skidded, your bag fell
  out of the dickey. I picked it up, threw it in the car and found it was open.
  In that bag was the robe of the Black Abbot, well worn, often used! Do you
  deny that?"</p>

  <p>"You've got to bring proof of this." It was Puttler who spoke.</p>

  <p>"Proof!" cried the other triumphantly. "I'll give you proof!"</p>

  <p>He walked rapidly through the hall to where his car was, the two men
  following him. He had left the bag under a rug at the back of the car.</p>

  <p>"There is the bag," he said, as he pulled the rug from its place. "And
  here"&mdash;he snapped open the bag&mdash;</p>

  <p>It was empty!</p>

  <p>"And here?" said Puttler encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"It was there a few minutes ago. I saw it before I came into the grounds.
  Somebody has taken it. You!" he accused Dick.</p>

  <p>Dick smiled.</p>

  <p>"Sergeant Puttler will testify that I came straight from my car into your
  august presence," he said sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you accuse me?" asked Puttler. "I was out here all the
  time."</p>

  <p>The baffled man looked from one to the other. It was impossible to believe
  that these two were in league. He knew Puttler by name to be one of the best
  officers Scotland Yard had ever had. He shrugged his shoulders and dropped
  his hands to his sides.</p>

  <p>"You've beaten me, Alford," he said, "for the time being. But I'm
  satisfied the girl is within a mile of this house, and I'm not going to rest
  until she is found. Heaven knows why you've done it&mdash;she's fond of you,
  and there was no need&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Gilder," said Dick roughly. "If you want to help, help!
  But you're not going to help by thinking that I've raised my hand against
  Leslie Gine. I don't care whether you're a friend or whether you're an enemy,
  but if you can help us to bring her back safely I will go on my knees to
  you!"</p>

  <p>Dick's voice was trembling, vibrant; there was a look in his eyes which
  not even Gilder, for all his prejudice, could mistake. He held out his hand
  and Dick Alford took it in a grip that made him wince.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch53"
     name="ch53"></a>CHAPTER LIII</h2>

  <p class="first">DESPITE all her gloomy prognostications as to her sleepless
  night, the head of Miss Wenner had hardly touched the pillow than her
  breathing became regular and even noticeable. Leslie Gine smiled to herself
  as she turned over and stealthily extinguished the candle. She had not been
  lying ten minutes before she realised, from past experience, that many a
  weary hour would pass before her eyes closed in sleep.</p>

  <p>She had the alternative of relighting the candle and reading, or counting
  myriads of sheep, and the first plan was somewhat hampered in its achievement
  by the fact that there was nothing in the room to read, and she dare not
  disturb the sentry, because that would probably wake Mary. So she lay
  perfectly still, overcoming a mad desire to turn every few minutes, trying to
  make her mind an absolute blank.</p>

  <p>With so much to occupy her thoughts, with the past twenty-four hours and
  all the terrible shocks they had brought, her effort to turn her mind into a
  cabbage was a hopeless failure.</p>

  <p>She heard a distant village clock striking the half-hours and the hours,
  and was grateful when one o'clock chimed, for she felt she had turned the
  hill of the night and was approaching the blessed day. There were queer
  creaks and noises in this old house; strange, stealthy footsteps that seemed
  very real; fingers brushing along wainscotings, queer little chatterings as
  of laughter. In spite of her courage, Leslie got up and lit the candle again
  and felt happier.</p>

  <p>She lay on her back, gazing at the ceiling, striving to concentrate upon
  one little crack that ran from corner to corner; and it seemed as though, as
  she looked, the room went perceptibly darker, and was filled with a strange
  unearthly light.</p>

  <p>And then she saw behind the door a great steel clothes hook that she did
  not remember having seen before; and attached was a cord and a shapeless
  something that hung with terrible limpness&mdash;a woman! She opened her eyes
  wide, almost screamed, but put her hand before her mouth in time.</p>

  <p>She had been dreaming, she realised, and she reached out for her
  handkerchief to wipe her damp face. There was no hook behind the door &mdash;
  nothing. She shivered and turned on her side, looked for the twentieth time
  at her watch. Twenty-five minutes past one.</p>

  <p><i>Tap, tap!</i></p>

  <p>That was distinct enough. It came from the room which Mary Wenner was to
  have occupied.</p>

  <p>A silence, and then the unmistakable sound of gravel being thrown against
  a window. Perhaps it was Dick and he wanted to see her. She slipped out of
  bed, pulled a dressing-gown about her, opened the door of the dark room and
  went in. The windows were closed, but as she entered the room she was
  startled by a third handful of gravel that sounded with terrifying
  distinctness.</p>

  <p>With trembling hands she pulled up the catch and pushed the casement open.
  A man was standing down below, and for a second she did not recognise him.
  And then everything went round; she had to grip the window ledge for
  support.</p>

  <p>It was Harry Alford!</p>

  <p>"Is that you, my dear?" His voice was little above a whisper, but
  remarkably clear.</p>

  <p>She managed to answer: "Yes."</p>

  <p>She was so dumbfounded that she could not ask one of the thousand
  questions which crowded to her lips.</p>

  <p>Harry! And alive!</p>

  <p>"You are in terrible danger," he said. "Will you come down? I can get a
  ladder."</p>

  <p>Before she could answer he had disappeared, and presently he came back,
  carrying a triangular-shaped ladder, and planted it against the side of the
  house. The top came within a foot of the window ledge.</p>

  <p>"I can't come, Harry; I'm not dressed. Besides, Miss Wenner is here."</p>

  <p>He raised his finger to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Don't wake her," he said.</p>

  <p>He had a little roll of something in his hand, and she noticed that he was
  bareheaded.</p>

  <p>"Can't you dress? I must see you."</p>

  <p>"Shall I call Dick?"</p>

  <p>"No, no." In his energy he almost raised his voice, and looked back over
  his shoulder. "That would spoil everything, and it would endanger his life.
  Dress quickly, my dear."</p>

  <p>What should she do? Her first instinct was to run to the door and tell the
  guard what she had seen; her second was to obey him. His earnestness and the
  terror in his voice made her yield to his suggestion.</p>

  <p>Quickly she dressed by candlelight, hoping and praying that Mary Wenner
  would wake up. Once she knocked against the bed, but Miss Wenner slept
  peacefully, a seraphic smile on her good-looking face, and the only notice
  she took of the disturbance was to murmur "Dick!"</p>

  <p>It needed that ludicrous interlude to restore Leslie's courage; for she
  could not be amused and afraid at the same time.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Dick was waiting below, she thought, and, swinging herself over
  the sill, she reached out her foot, found the top rung of the ladder and came
  down. Harry was standing on the grass-plot, curiously alert and watchful.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Harry?" she asked in a low voice, but he put his finger to
  his lips again and led her, not, as she expected, towards the front of the
  house, but by a wide circuit, keeping to the shadow of the trees, until they
  went past the rosery and near to the stables.</p>

  <p>A dog barked as they passed in silence.</p>

  <p>"I can't go any farther, Harry."</p>

  <p>"You must, you must!" His voice was urgent, compelling. "I tell you that
  not only my life, but your own is in danger."</p>

  <p>"But what of Miss Wenner?" She drew back.</p>

  <p>"They will not touch her. My mother's spirit will watch that poor girl
  &mdash; she died in that room."</p>

  <p>Leslie gasped.</p>

  <p>"Your mother?" she asked, in an awe-stricken whisper.</p>

  <p>"Come!" He was impatient, caught her by the arm and led her farther down,
  until she saw near at hand the gleam of the Ravensrill.</p>

  <p>"But, Harry, I can't go any farther." She stopped resolutely. "I'm sure
  you're mistaken. Where have you been all this time? Everybody has been
  looking for you, and Dick has been terribly worried."</p>

  <p>He laughed. (It was the laugh that the policeman heard.)</p>

  <p>"Dick is worried? That is rich!"</p>

  <p>And now, as the challenge of a distant voice came to her, she saw his face
  in the moonlight. He was unshaven, unkempt, grimy of face and hands; he wore
  no collar, and stood a collarless man in a long frock-coat with a wild
  appearance. Slowly she drew back, dread and fear on her face, and then he
  clutched her by the wrists.</p>

  <p>"If you scream I will throw you into the river and kneel on you until you
  are dead," he whispered in so calm and matter-of-fact a tone that she could
  not believe he was serious.</p>

  <p>And yet she had an extra sense which told her that he was not only
  serious, but that she was in deadly peril. He kept hold of her wrist, or she
  would have taken to flight, though she would have had little chance of
  escaping one who in his schooldays was a noted sprinter.</p>

  <p>She remembered something else now and felt sick. Harry Alford had
  captained his public school team at Bisley and had carried everything before
  him. This pale anaemic youth was the greatest shot of his time.</p>

  <p>The greatest shot! She remembered the bullet that was meant for her, and
  he felt her dragging on his hand, but said no word. She must not lose her
  nerve at this moment of crisis.</p>

  <p>They were making for the ruins. Near the edge of the cutting, Puttler had
  told her, were stationed two men; they must see her soon. But Harry went no
  farther than the broken tower, and here he paused and pulled the block of
  stone aside.</p>

  <p>Now she knew; they were going down to that dreadful underground cavern
  where Dick had taken her. Dick Alford knew his brother was there! She knew
  this long before she saw the basket, still filled with food, that stood at
  the bottom of the steps.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch54"
     name="ch54"></a>CHAPTER LIV</h2>

  <p class="first">HARRY had lit a candle, and, guided by this, she went down
  the steep circular stairway.</p>

  <p>"He brought me that food&mdash;the devil!" He pointed his shaking finger
  to the basket.</p>

  <p>"Dick brought it?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Poisoned," he said. "But he didn't catch me. Poisoned, every bit of
  it!"</p>

  <p>He carefully unwrapped a white napkin and showed a dainty pile of
  sandwiches, took one and opened it.</p>

  <p>"You can see the crystals glittering on the meat," he said, in so calm and
  matter-of-fact a tone that she almost thought she saw something glitter on
  the white flesh.</p>

  <p>Then he lifted the bottle and looked at it with a smile. "It was too
  childish. Nobody but a fool would have dreamt I could be deceived." He put
  the bottle and sandwiches back again carefully and covered them with the
  napkin that had been over the basket.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, and they went farther into the apartment.</p>

  <p>She saw a big gap in the floor and a stone standing straight up from the
  centre.</p>

  <p>"I have a lamp below. I prepared this place a very long time ago against
  such an emergency. Light and food&mdash;and all the water you want. Will you
  go first?"</p>

  <p>He was very courteous and polite, took her hand to guide her, and held the
  light so that she could see the stairs, and came down immediately after,
  stopping to swing the stone into place.</p>

  <p>"Will you hold the candle?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She was trembling so violently that her fingers were soon covered with hot
  grease, but she did not feel the smart of the boiling wax; her eyes were
  fixed upon the man, fascinated.</p>

  <p>He was lighting a new storm lantern which burnt, she guessed, paraffin
  gas, and it took some time before a brilliant bright light illuminated the
  room in which she found herself. It was twice the size of the apartment
  above, and neither the walls nor the floor had fallen into decay. It was
  almost as new-looking as it had been when the Norman builders had handed it
  to the Black Fathers of Chelfordbury.</p>

  <p>The first unusual things she saw were two sporting rifles that stood in a
  corner of the room. Following her eyes, he smiled.</p>

  <p>"I shall not sell my life without a struggle," he said firmly.</p>

  <p>The furniture consisted of a very old refectory table, the top of which
  must have been at least four inches in thickness, a long form and a high
  chair that looked like a bishop's throne. There were no visible windows, but
  the ceiling did not quite reach the wall, and there seemed a space all round
  the room where air was admitted.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," he said.</p>

  <p>He took the thing he had been carrying, unrolled it, and, to her
  astonishment, kissed it passionately before he carried it to a truckle bed
  that she had not noticed before, and tacked it to a beam which showed between
  the stone courses and was in truth the only wood she had seen in the
  building.</p>

  <p>She looked in amazement, and knew the picture instantly. It was the head
  of his mother.</p>

  <p>"How lovely!" he sighed. "How wonderful! Do you know, I feel that nothing
  matters now, Leslie!"</p>

  <p>He smiled at her, and looked at that moment so happy that she could have
  cried.</p>

  <p>"Richard hated her," he went on. "He never lost an opportunity of speaking
  ill of her. I am told that in my absence he used to bring the servants into
  the library, and together they would laugh and gibe at this beautiful
  martyr."</p>

  <p>"How absurd, Harry! You know Dick would do no such thing," she said,
  stirred to his defence.</p>

  <p>But he was neither angry nor did he show any resentment at her
  championship.</p>

  <p>"You don't know Dick," he said simply. "Dick, of course, is the Black
  Abbot. I only found it out a week or two ago, when I went into his room and
  discovered the costume in a box. He had forgotten to put it away."</p>

  <p>She did not believe the only truth he had told her so far, but she felt
  that it would be undiplomatic, to say the least, to argue with him.</p>

  <p>"Harry, I can't stay here, you know," she said. "There is only one room,
  and I have a weakness for a daily bath&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He walked across the room and pulled aside a sacking that hid one corner,
  and pointed dramatically.</p>

  <p>"You will find everything you require here," he said. "This room is yours.
  I shall sleep upstairs, only coming below at the first hint of danger, either
  to you or to me. The position calls for courage and patience, and I know that
  my wife-to-be has those qualities to excess."</p>

  <p>He was his old, smiling, genial self.</p>

  <p>"By the way, there are plenty of books to read&mdash;I brought some away
  from the house. They were rather heavy and I had to drag them a little bit,
  but thank heaven I got just what I wanted."</p>

  <p>She noticed them now for the first time, piled at one end of the refectory
  table. He took up a volume and turned the leaves lovingly.</p>

  <p>"You do not read German? I think you told me that before. It is a pity,
  because this is a very fascinating narrative, told by an outsider, of the
  Chelfords of the period. You will be pleased to learn that I have located the
  treasure. It was not difficult. I knew all the time that it was behind the
  second door in the room above."</p>

  <p>"Have you known this place for long?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"For six years," he said. "I found it on the twenty-first anniversary of
  my dear mother's death. I think I ought to say 'murder,' for there is no
  doubt that my father, who had all the worst qualities of Dick, killed her
  &mdash; hanged her."</p>

  <p>Her face contorted with horror.</p>

  <p>"In that room?" she said, in a strained voice. "Behind the door?"</p>

  <p>He nodded. "The thing was hushed up. My clever father was too great a man
  to be put on trial for his life, and the story was circulated that she had
  died by her own hand."</p>

  <p>Every word he said was a lie, as she knew, but he believed it. He
  explained quite rationally how the light was worked; showed her the little
  wash-place with the stream of water running from the raw rock through a
  cavity into some invisible deeps; even gave her a short résumé of the history
  of the place. It had been built by the Black Abbot himself for his own
  especial purpose.</p>

  <p>"My first idea was that there was another exit here, or rather an entrance
  for those peculiar friends of his, but that I have failed to discover."</p>

  <p>He took up one of the rifles, shot back the bolt with the air of an
  expert, and, going up two steps, unfastened the heavy oaken bar that kept the
  stone in place.</p>

  <p>The slab pivoted round, and she had a wild idea that when it was closed
  she would fasten it; but he was evidently prepared for this, for she heard
  him drag a paving-stone to the edge of the hole and place it so that the trap
  could not close.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Leslie," he said, peering down at her through his spectacles.
  "You will not mind my light? I want to read a chapter before I sleep."</p>

  <p>For a quarter of an hour no sound broke the silence. She sat on the bed,
  her hands clasped on her knees. And then she heard him move and her breath
  came faster, but he had only a question to ask.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Leslie, did Thomas leave any relations? I should like to provide
  for them. The man annoyed me, and I really do not regret killing him. But I
  should not like to feel that his relatives were suffering through my act of
  justice."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said, and it did not seem to be her voice.</p>

  <p class="first">IT seemed an interminable time before his light went out.
  Was he sleeping? Should she attempt to escape past him? From where she sat
  she could see his hand, which lay over the edge of the pit, and she
  remembered Dick telling her how light a sleeper he was. Systematically, and
  without moving, she searched the place with her eyes, foot by foot. In one
  corner of the room square tins of every shape were piled. She supposed they
  were preserved provisions and she wondered how he got rid of the debris. She
  examined the wash-place, cupped her hands and drank of the cool, refreshing
  water, afterwards bathing her face. The touch of the cold spring water
  refreshed and invigorated her.</p>

  <p>How long she sat there motionless she could not tell. She was in a kind of
  coma, paralysed by a sense of helplessness. It must have been hours before
  she heard him move and, his blanket over his arm and rifle in hand, he crept
  down the steps and fastened the slab.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Don't speak&mdash;it is he!" he whispered, and sat down by her side, his
  hand on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>She heard the sound of footsteps above.</p>

  <p>Dick!</p>

  <p>She had to bite her lip to prevent the cry that came. Harry was watching
  her&mdash;a scream and she would be dead. Dick could never break open that
  trap in time, even if he could locate the sound. Presently the footsteps went
  away and she felt the hand on her shoulder relax.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to disturb you."</p>

  <p>He picked up blanket and rifle and ascended the steps; she watched him
  pull the paving-stone forward, and after a while there was quietness.</p>

  <p>There must be some exit, if the legend of the disreputable Black Abbot was
  true. She took off her shoes and walked noiselessly over the even floor,
  examining it stone by stone. The walls were obviously impenetrable; the
  vaulted ceiling was decorated with the lines of a St Andrew's Cross that met
  in a great stone rosette in the centre.</p>

  <p>He had left a box of matches and a candle on the table. This she lit and
  carried it into the tiny cavern where the water ran. She could see no roof;
  she guessed it stretched up the full height of the tower, and that somewhere
  above was the edge of the circular staircase that had brought her down to the
  first cavern.</p>

  <p>Holding the light above her head, she strained her eyes upward, and
  presently she saw great iron D-shaped projections fixed at intervals of a
  foot; they reached to the top, and, most blessed sight of all, she saw above
  her head a star.</p>

  <p>And yet she was puzzled. The Abbot had a reputation for gallantry, and it
  was hardly likely that the visitors who shared his solitude would make their
  entrance by so precarious a means. She reached up, but her hand was three
  feet from the nearest rung, and there was nothing in the room on which she
  could stand. She went back to her bed noiselessly and pulled out one of the
  sheets; she took the remaining rifle and, by dint of great exertion, managed
  to push one end of the sheet through the nearest rung. After ten minutes'
  work the end came down and she had a rope. She knotted together the sheets at
  the end, and tested her weight. The staple held, and, springing up, she
  climbed hand over hand to the lowest rung. Her arms were almost pulled from
  their sockets; she was breathless, but she held on, and, reaching up, caught
  the third rung and pulled herself up until her feet rested on the first. She
  waited a little while to gain breath and began to climb. Higher and higher,
  and then her heart sank. Above her she saw a steel grille, fixed immovably
  across the exit. It was impossible even to put her arm through, the meshes
  were so small, and with a bitter sense of disappointment she descended again
  and slid down the sheet to the floor.</p>

  <p>There was no escape this way. She unknotted the sheet and replaced it in
  her bed, stained with rust and torn at the edges. She brought the rifle back
  with her. She was an enthusiastic miniature target shot and knew the
  mechanism of the weapon. Pulling out the magazine, she found it loaded to its
  full capacity. Here, then, was something; her confidence grew, though she
  prayed she might never have to use this weapon upon the madman who slept so
  quietly above. The rifle might be used to terrify him in an emergency.</p>

  <p>She went back to the wash-place and looked up. Day was breaking, and she
  took a sudden resolve. The man had been almost his normal self, as she had
  known him, and she guessed that this was but an interlude and that there were
  periods when she must shoot to save her life. Stealthily she crept up the
  stairs, rifle in hand, and she heard him stir, and presently his shrill voice
  asked: "Where are you going? Stay where you are, you vixen!"</p>

  <p>She brought up the butt of the rifle and smashed past the paving-stone
  that prevented the trap from closing. The stone thudded down, and instantly
  she swung round the heavy bar that kept it in place. She heard him stamping
  and screaming above; heard, with a shivering horror, the threats that, as she
  thought, no human tongue could frame; staggering down the steps, she
  fell.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch56"
     name="ch56"></a>CHAPTER LVI</h2>

  <p class="first">A HIGH official from Scotland Yard had arrived and was
  interviewing Dick in the library.</p>

  <p>"I am wholly responsible. I have always known my brother was queer, and
  about a year ago I was certain that the horrible taint of madness which his
  poor mother transmitted to him was developing in a way which could only have
  one end. I begged of him to see a medical man, but he hated doctors. I
  brought down the best alienists from London in various guises, sometimes as
  bailiffs, and occasionally as prospective buyers of our property, but in
  their presence he behaved so rationally that it was impossible that I could
  get a certificate.</p>

  <p>"My own position was a very delicate one. I am, as you know, the heir to
  the property. Any step I took meant that the estate came into my hands, and
  that eventually, when poor Harry died, as one doctor told me he must die in a
  few years, I should be branded with the stigma of having put him away, and I
  was anxious to save the family name. My chief anxiety was that he should
  never marry."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it easy enough to take the girl into your confidence?"</p>

  <p>Dick was silent for a while.</p>

  <p>"Not in this case. There were reasons why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And the official, dimly understanding, changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"Then you were the Black Abbot?"</p>

  <p>"Mostly," confessed Dick. "My brother was terrified of the Abbot and would
  never go out if there was a rumour that the Black Abbot was about. I was
  especially anxious to keep him in the house, where, under my eye, there was
  no chance for him to indulge in these extraordinary paroxysms that have
  really alarmed the countryside. The man whom the villagers feared and whom
  they call the Black Abbot is really Harry. I was a very silent Black Abbot,"
  he smiled faintly, "and I had no other purpose than to keep Harry indoors.
  I'm going to say I did not always succeed."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the truth will have to come out now," said the official,
  shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"I wish it had come out last week," replied Dick bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Do you think your brother is responsible for the disappearance of Miss
  Gine?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly. He must have attracted her to the window, and persuaded her
  to come down into the grounds. He was very plausible; no man would dream that
  he was not sane, only I, who have seen"&mdash;he drew a long
  breath&mdash;"what I have seen. I'll tell you this, Colonel," he said, with
  sudden vehemence, "not all the lordship of Chelford, not all the estates, not
  even the Chelford treasure, would make me live again my life of the past five
  years! There are times," he said, his voice trembling with passion, "when I
  feel I would like to dig up the abbey and scatter its stones in the dust,
  raze this house to the ground, and turn the place into a public park." He
  laughed at his own excess. "I am talking like an idiot. This place belongs to
  a family that knows not Harry. He is just a terrible accident. My dear mother
  often told me how worried my father was about Harry, his queer, secretive
  ways. And yet in a way he is a sportsman, one of the best shots in England as
  a boy, a great runner, and a wonderful fellow over the country, until about
  eight years ago, when this treasure bug got into his brain and he shut
  himself away from us all and gave his mind and his soul to this wild
  chase."</p>

  <p>"The gold?"</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "If it were only the gold, that would have been an
  intelligent interest in life."</p>

  <p>He described Harry's search for the elixir, the famous Life Water of which
  the ancient Chelford had written in his diary.</p>

  <p>"It is probably no more than a flask of a native wine&mdash;arrack or the
  like," said Dick. "Poor Harry!"</p>

  <p>Miss Wenner had intended leaving by the early morning train but had
  changed her mind. Possibly the arrival of Fabrian Gilder had been a factor.
  She had one solution for Leslie's disappearance.</p>

  <p>"Have you searched the abbey?" she asked, not once but a dozen times.</p>

  <p>Dick was weary; the abbey had been his first thought. He had suspected
  this was Harry's hiding-place, and with his own hands had taken a basket of
  provisions for him, but this, he saw, was untouched.</p>

  <p>There was one possibility about the underground cavern, and that was the
  second door, and he had ordered the blacksmith and his assistant to be at the
  stone tower at two o'clock that afternoon with instruments, one of which had
  to be procured from London.</p>

  <p>The presence of Miss Wenner was not as distasteful to Gilder as he thought
  it would have been. To use a phrase of childhood, she was "on his side." In
  very truth, Miss Wenner was on anybody's side if they happened to be
  agreeable to her.</p>

  <p>They were walking through the rosery before lunch, and certainly the trend
  of Mary Wenner's remarks was very comforting to a man who had been so badly
  rebuffed.</p>

  <p>"If I had my way, Fabrian dear" (she assumed all the rights and privileges
  of an engagement which was somewhat illusory, and he made only a feeble
  resistance), "if I had my way I'd put you in charge of this case. After all,
  you are the very man to solve this mystery, and I must say you could have
  knocked me down with a feather when you told me you were fifty&mdash;you
  don't look a day more than thirty&mdash;and you've got experience, you're a
  lawyer, you're up to all kinds of artfulness."</p>

  <p>"Not to all kinds," said Gilder, with a grim recollection of a certain
  blank cheque.</p>

  <p>"Well, to most kinds," conceded Miss Wenner. "And what are they all doing?
  This Dick Alford and this so-called detective? They're just standing around,
  scratching their heads, whilst you could go, as it were, to the real heart of
  the mystery. Don't deny it&mdash;I'm sure you could, Fabe."</p>

  <p>"Don't call me Fabe, Mary," he asked gently. "If you want to call me by my
  Christian name, let us have all the three syllables."</p>

  <p>"You're a man of the world, Fabrian" (she accentuated the word as she
  would have done "Mary Ann"). "You understand the ins and outs of everything.
  Why don't they come to you like men and say, 'Mr Gilder, what is your opinion
  of this mystery?' Instead of which, they don't so much as ask you if you've
  got a mouth!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they know that," said Gilder in good humour. He lifted his head
  suddenly, a frown on his face. He had heard a shot; more than a shot, the
  whirr and whine of a bullet.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Something fell at his feet with a "plop!" He saw a little hole, and,
  stooping, dug out a bullet with his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Where on earth did that come from?"</p>

  <p>He looked up at the sky, but the aeroplane which was later to make an
  appearance, and which had nothing to do with this mysterious shooting, was
  not yet in sight.</p>

  <p>Dick had heard the shot and was running across the lawn.</p>

  <p>"Did you&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>They heard it again, and presently Dick saw leaves fall from a laurel bush
  and heard the thud of an impact. One of the police who were still patrolling
  the grounds shouted to him, but he could not hear what he was saying, and
  raced across to him. Nearer at hand he saw that the man was pointing to the
  ruins.</p>

  <p>"It came from there," shouted the constable, and Dick changed
  direction.</p>

  <p>He was flying up the slope when the third shot sounded, and this time he
  located it with fair accuracy. Somebody was shooting from the tower.</p>

  <p>Happily he had made preparations for the blacksmith's visit, and there was
  an assortment of lanterns near the entrance. He stopped long enough to light
  one, and, slipping back the catch with his knife, he pushed aside the stone
  corner-piece and ran down the stairs. The room was empty. He tried the
  mystery door; that too was closed. Somebody shouted his name from the landing
  above and he answered: "Come down, Gilder. There's nobody here."</p>

  <p>Gilder descended the steps gingerly and looked round with his keen, shrewd
  eyes. And then he remembered and pointed to the slab.</p>

  <p>"Have you tried that? I meant to tell you before."</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, but I rather think that the stone turns on a pivot. If that
  is the case, there are pretty stout supports underneath that will want
  cutting through."</p>

  <p>Gilder sprawled flat on the floor, his ear to the crack.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing there that is audible," he said. "Can't you smell
  anything?"</p>

  <p>He put his nose to the crack.</p>

  <p>"There's a petrol light burning down there, or else it has been burning
  recently."</p>

  <p>Flat on his face, Dick sniffed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, and called: "Leslie!"</p>

  <p>There was no answer. He called again, with a like result.</p>

  <p>Gilder went up the stairs and searched amongst the tools that had been
  brought in readiness for the afternoon's investigation. He selected two saws
  and a second lantern, and, lighting this, he descended to Dick's side.</p>

  <p>"It is pretty sure to be an oaken support; these old builders seldom used
  iron," he said.</p>

  <p>Throwing off his coat, he rolled up his sleeves. The thin blade of the saw
  worked down between the stones, and after a while he began sawing
  gingerly.</p>

  <p>"It's wood," he said. "You'll find yours is the same."</p>

  <p>They both worked at one end, for, as he pointed out, there would be only
  one bar, the other end of the stone being bevelled to meet the edge of the
  floor. The wood was like rock, and both men were perspiring before they had
  sawn half through the support. Presently Dick drew out his saw. It had gone
  through the oak and he had heard the loose end fall below. A few seconds
  later, Gilder's saw passed through the last obstruction. Gingerly he put his
  foot on the edge and pressed down, and the stone trap swung open.</p>

  <p>They looked down into a dark vault; and now the smell of the burning lamp
  was very pungent. Dick lowered the lantern and peered down. He could see no
  sign of human life. He caught a view of the end of a bed, a table, and, on
  the floor, a rifle. He reached the bottom and, swinging his lantern round,
  called:"Leslie!"</p>

  <p>A mocking echo came back to him from the little cavern at the far end of
  the apartment. The place was empty; the man and woman who, five minutes
  before, had fought in a grim struggle had disappeared.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch57"
     name="ch57"></a>CHAPTER LVII</h2>

  <p class="first">"LESLIE!"</p>

  <p>He called again, his voice hoarse with anxiety. He had seen two little
  shoes by the side of the bed. Her hat was on the floor, crushed into a
  shapeless mass. Picking up the rifle, he felt the barrel; it was still warm,
  and under the tower there were four empty cartridge cases. And then, holding
  his lantern high, he saw the rungs in the rough face of the wall, and jumped
  to the conclusion that she had escaped that way. Within a minute he leapt up,
  caught the lower rung and ran up the ladder to the top, oblivious to one or
  two ominous cracks as his weight came upon the old ironwork. The grille at
  the top stopped him. He had seen it, but thought it might be movable.</p>

  <p>"They couldn't have gone that way," he said breathlessly as he came down
  to the ground.</p>

  <p>Gilder rubbed his grey hair.</p>

  <p>"Then where on earth have they gone?" he asked irritably.</p>

  <p>They searched every inch of the long room, pulled the bed from the wall,
  but beneath was solid stone pavement. The table seemed fastened to the floor;
  they could not move it.</p>

  <p>"Do you notice anything about this floor?" Gilder asked suddenly. "It is
  not level."</p>

  <p>And when Dick looked, he saw this was true. The floor sloped gradually
  down from the wash cavern to the wall behind the steps. Gilder went in search
  of a hammer, and the two, now reinforced by Puttler and the Scotland Yard
  man, went over every inch of the wall and flooring, tapping and sounding.
  They struck no hollow place. The four men took hold of the side of the table
  and tried to drag it from its foundations, but they might as well have tried
  to move the wall itself. It had a thick oaken base, from which ran three
  pillars supporting the enormously heavy top.</p>

  <p>It was very clear to Dick what had happened. The girl had been attacked,
  and, having discovered this opening to the sky, had procured a rifle by some
  means and had fired up the shaft to attract attention. Then she had been
  overcome and&mdash;what?</p>

  <p>The water ran down through a crevice in the solid rock about six or eight
  inches wide. It was impossible that any human being could have gone down that
  narrow slit, but, to make sure, he had the edges of the water-worn rock
  broken away. The blacksmith by this time was waiting above. Dick had asked
  him to bring his tools; the second door might yield some sort of
  solution.</p>

  <p>For half an hour they worked with jacks and levers, and presently, with a
  deafening crack, the lock parted and the door was pushed open. There was
  revealed a room similar in shape and size to that which Mary Wenner had
  discovered; with this exception, that there were no stone benches, and in the
  centre of the apartment was a circular hole. Dick knelt by the side and held
  down his lantern; he heard the faint "clug" of water, and saw the light
  reflected at a considerable depth.</p>

  <p>"A well," he said. "All these old places have an interior well. There's
  one in the Tower of London, in the centre of the dungeon."</p>

  <p>This room had been used as a prison at a distant period. At intervals
  along the walls hung rusted chains, with leg-irons attached. In one corner he
  saw a heap of rags, glimpsed a milk-white bone and shuddered. What was the
  history of this poor wretch who had been shut away from the light of God's
  sunshine, to die miserably in this dark and dreadful place?</p>

  <p>"Well, there's nothing there," said Gilder, peering over. Dick tied his
  lantern to the end of a cord and let it slowly down to the depths. Thirty
  feet below, as near as he could judge, the bottom of the lantern touched
  water. The old builders had built splendidly. The green, weed-grown sides of
  the well seemed intact. And then his heart almost stood still. A hand was
  thrust out, seemingly from the solid brickwork of the well, a white hand on
  which flashed and sparkled a single diamond that he knew well. And from below
  he heard a muffled voice; and in his agitation the cord which held the
  lantern slipped from his hand into the water.</p>

  <p>He cursed aloud in his rage at his own criminal carelessness.</p>

  <p>"Give me the other lantern!" he called, and pulling the other hand over
  hand, he untied it and flung it aside, fastening in its place the lighted
  storm lamp that Puttler handed to him. "And get a rope&mdash;quickly."</p>

  <p>But there was no rope nearer than Fossaway Manor, and he fumed in his
  impatience and would have made an attempt to slip down the treacherous sides
  of the well if Puttler had not restrained him.</p>

  <p>After an eternity one of the detectives came running back carrying a rope,
  and, dropping one end, they fastened the other to a crowbar and placed this
  across the open doorway. Dick slipped down the rope, the handle of the
  lantern between his teeth. The sides were wet and slimy, and presently he
  came to the place where he had seen the girl's hand.</p>

  <p>It was a small air-hole about six inches by four. He tried to look through
  with the aid of his lamp, but he could see nothing but a rough rock wall. He
  called the girl by name, but no answer came, and the word "Leslie" came
  echoing back from the interior.</p>

  <p>And now he saw that these little apertures occurred at regular intervals.
  The first two were hidden by overhanging water weeds, but from below they
  were visible. Some sort of natural stone gallery existed on the other side of
  this stonework, and he remembered having heard at some remote period that the
  abbey had been built upon an early English catacomb. In all probability each
  of those apertures represented a distinct "landing," or a place where some
  natural winding staircase touched the wall in its revolutions.</p>

  <p>He had made a rough loop for his foot, and they passed him down a crowbar
  at the end of a cord. With this he attacked the hole in the wall, but found
  himself engaged in an impossible task. Nothing short of an explosive could
  blow these holes larger. He was almost exhausted by his efforts, and they had
  to haul him to the top for a rest. Puttler was anxious to go down, but Dick
  insisted upon being lowered again. This time he took with him a rod, to the
  end of which a small electric bulb had been attached. The flex ran along the
  rod, which was a bamboo cane, and terminated in a small battery in his
  pocket. He switched on the light and pushed the bulb through the opening. He
  could see now that the wall, which he had thought was natural rock, had been
  roughly hewn, but he could not see the floor nor more than a foot in either
  direction. Withdrawing the rod, he put in his hand and felt around, but could
  touch nothing but the outer facing of the well.</p>

  <p>"Look out!"</p>

  <p>The warning shout was Gilder's and came from above. He drew out his hand
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"Away from the wall&mdash;push with your feet!" yelled Gilder.</p>

  <p>He had a glimpse of a grimy hand thrust out from one of the square air-
  holes, saw the flicker of steel and felt the rope giving as strand after
  strand was slashed. Then, with a crack, the rope parted, and he went down,
  down, until the bitterly cold waters engulfed him.</p>

  <p>He struck the bottom with his feet and paddled up to the surface again. He
  was instantly chilled to the marrow. He saw the lantern come down towards
  him, and heard Gilder say: "Hold to the cord just enough to keep you
  afloat."</p>

  <p>Dumbly he obeyed. His eyes were fixed on the air-hole. So too were the
  eyes of Puttler, who, flat on the ground, his head and shoulders over the
  edge, covered with his revolver the place where the hand had emerged.</p>

  <p>The cut end of the rope was passed down to him. By reaching up he could
  just grip it, but not sufficiently to obtain a sure purchase. Cramp had
  attacked his legs. The paralysing coldness of the water was astounding, and
  in one moment of fear it seemed that his life was to end miserably in this
  dark hole. There was no foothold on either side, and unless help came quickly
  he knew he could no longer keep his senses.</p>

  <p>Almost within reach was the lowest of the small apertures, but it did not
  seem worthwhile to reach for that. The cord of the lantern served to keep him
  afloat, the warmth of the burning wick was the only comfort he had.</p>

  <p>"Dick!" He heard his name whispered with a fierce intensity. "Dick, take
  my hand!"</p>

  <p>It came out of the lower air-hole, and with an effort he reached and found
  his wrist gripped. And then his senses left him.</p>

  <p>When he came to himself he was lying in the open air; the warmth of the
  sun's rays made him sleepy.</p>

  <p>"Where is Leslie?" he asked, struggling up on his elbow. They looked at
  him blankly, thinking that he was in a delirium.</p>

  <p>"How did I get out?"</p>

  <p>"Gilder went down for you when he saw you drop."</p>

  <p>"But Leslie caught me by the wrist," he said wildly. "She was there
  &mdash; didn't you see her, Puttler?"</p>

  <p>Puttler shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I saw you holding on to the side just as the new rope came, and Gilder
  went down for you."</p>

  <p>Dick was ghastly.</p>

  <p>"You didn't see her? You didn't hear her?" Struggling to his feet, he
  passed his hand wearily across his forehead. Had he been dreaming? Was that
  part of the delirium of the death that nearly overtook him? But he was sure,
  as positive as of any human experience he had had. Leslie's hand had come out
  from the wall and caught him by the wrist. He had seen the diamond
  scintillate in the light of the lantern and then he could remember nothing
  more. But it had been Leslie. He could still feel the pressure of her fingers
  about his wrist. He had not been dreaming. Somewhere in the deeps of the
  earth was the woman he loved, and he was helpless to save her. He covered his
  face with his hands and for a while his shoulders heaved.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch58"
     name="ch58"></a>CHAPTER LVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">LESLIE had no doubt that the wooden bar would hold. She
  could afford to sit, covering her ears to shut out the hideous noise above,
  until his paroxysm had subsided. It must have been in such a mad fury as
  this, after the killing of Thomas, that he had wreaked destruction upon his
  room before, in a sudden fit of panic, he had got out of the window and,
  taking his books from the library (she saw the torn and soiled pillowcase in
  which he had packed them), had escaped to this lair of his. She took her hand
  from her ears; he was moaning dreadfully, but somehow she could endure that.
  Fortunately, she had put on her wristwatch when she dressed, and this marked
  the passage of the hours. Noon came; there would be people about the estate
  now, though it was not likely that Dick would come again to the ruins unless
  he was attracted there.</p>

  <p>The plan she had made she now proceeded to put into execution. Standing
  under the shaft, she fired a round into the air. The third shot struck the
  iron grille, and ricocheted with an angry buzz that sounded like the drone of
  a bee. No sound came from the room above. If she could only attract Dick to
  the ruins, she could indicate her position. But Harry had a rifle! She went
  cold at the thought. She may have lured him to his death.</p>

  <p>For one mad moment she thought of opening the trap and forcing her way out
  at the point of the rifle. But it was too late now. And then she heard his
  voice, sounding hollowly and faintly.</p>

  <p>"Leslie!"</p>

  <p>She went up one of the steps so that she could hear him better.</p>

  <p>"They're coming, Leslie. You will tell them I haven't hurt you, won't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," she replied eagerly.</p>

  <p>He said nothing after that, until there came a shuffling and stamping of
  feet above her head, and then she heard him say:</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Dick, old man! I hope I haven't given you any trouble."</p>

  <p>From below she heard a deep rumble of sound which might have been a voice,
  but in her eagerness she was tugging at the oaken support, and in another
  second the stone fell behind her and she scrambled up through the trap. She
  could see nothing; the place was in darkness.</p>

  <p>"Dick!" she called.</p>

  <p>And then a hand gripped her, and she realised with horror that all the
  shufflings of feet and the conversation had been so much acting on his
  part.</p>

  <p>She was still holding the rifle, but before she could raise it he had
  gripped the stock and wrenched it from her hand. She heard it fall with a
  clatter on the stone floor below.</p>

  <p>Half swooning in her fear and terror, her struggles grew weaker. He was
  holding her in his arms, and his strength was surprising.</p>

  <p>"We are going below, my sweet," he whispered in her ear. "At last I know
  the truth! So it was Dick you wanted! Dear Dick!"</p>

  <p>He was chuckling softly to himself as he carried her to the top of the
  steps.</p>

  <p>"Will you walk down, or must I throw you?" he asked, in a tone so even and
  rational that he might have been uttering some commonplace of everyday
  life.</p>

  <p>With trembling knees she walked down the steps into the lighted room, and
  he followed, pausing to close the trap and secure it firmly.</p>

  <p>"Sit down." He pointed to the settle by the table and immediately she sat
  down. Her face was ghastly; her last reserves of courage were almost sapped.
  "You have hurt me beyond forgiveness, Leslie," he said, his solemn eyes fixed
  on hers. "Do you realise what you have done? You have treated with contempt
  Harry Alford, eighteenth Earl of Chelford, Viscount of Carberry, Baron
  Alford."</p>

  <p>With the solemnity of a child reciting a lesson he repeated the titles he
  held, even to a remote barony of Aquitaine which the Chelfords had held in
  the dim past. She had a queer feeling that she was standing before a judge,
  listening to an indictment of some hideous crime she had committed.</p>

  <p>"You have attempted to endanger my life; you have conspired with those who
  hate me; you have treacherously held communication with and given comfort to
  my enemies."</p>

  <p>There were other charges, that would have sounded ludicrous at other
  times, would have roused her to fury, but she listened now, husbanding all
  her strength for the coming struggle.</p>

  <p>His rifle leant against the steps, but he barred her way effectively.
  Looking round for some weapon, she saw nothing but the lamp, and that was too
  heavy for use.</p>

  <p>"For you," he said, in tones of deepest gravity, "there can be only one
  punishment&mdash;death!"</p>

  <p>His voice trembled. She felt that, in his queer, crazy way, he was sorry
  for her, and regretted the necessity. She tried to rise, but her limbs
  refused her office. She put out an appealing hand and then, with a sudden
  leap, he was on her. His hand closed about her throat, strangling the scream.
  And then, up above, there was the unmistakable sound of footsteps and a deep
  voice. It was Dick. She tried to call out, but he held her tight. With one
  hand he reached over and extinguished the lamp; and now, in a final
  desperation of fear, she threw him backward and for a second he released his
  hold.</p>

  <p>But before her tortured throat could utter a sound he was at her again,
  pressing her back against the edge of the table. She tore at his hand, but it
  was immovable. This was death! A loud ringing in her ears, a fiery light
  before her eyes; she was losing consciousness. And then she felt the table
  move, at first slowly and then so rapidly that she lost her balance. The big
  refectory table was sliding lengthways towards the end wall. His grip
  relaxed, and in that instant he dropped away from her, and, reaching out her
  hand, she could feel nothing. She heard a thud and a groan and stepped
  forward&mdash;into space. She did not see the yawning cavern before her. One
  desperate effort she made to recover her balance, caught at the hard edge of
  the floor as she fell and went slipping and sliding down stairs that cracked
  and broke beneath her, until her feet struck something soft and yielding.
  Overhead there was a deep rumbling sound, a soft thud, and silence.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch59"
     name="ch59"></a>CHAPTER LIX</h2>

  <p class="first">HARRY was unconscious. She felt his face, and her fingers
  touched something warm and wet.</p>

  <p>She could see nothing; the darkness was impenetrable. No sound came from
  the room from which she had fallen. The floor was thick, the heavy oaken base
  of the refectory table gliding&mdash;she guessed on rollers that worked as
  truly as they had when, hundreds of years before, the Black Abbot found this
  exit so valuable&mdash;had slipped back into its place. If she only had some
  sort of light! It occurred to her to search the unfortunate Harry. Presently
  she found a silver box containing matches. She struck one and looked around.
  They were lying at the foot of what had once been a wooden stair. The treads
  were broken, the heavily carved handrail had rotted, leaving two wide gaps.
  Half the treads had vanished, the other half were now broken by her fall.</p>

  <p>Harry was lying in a recess carved from the solid rock, and left and right
  ran a narrow passage streaming with water. She left the alcove and struck
  another match. The passage curved and twisted so that only a few feet in
  either direction were visible. Pools of still water filled the hollows of the
  floor; long bunches of grey fungus, grape-like in its formation, hung from
  the roof. Yet the air was sweet enough. She felt a gentle draught coming from
  the left-hand passage, but as yet she could not explore and she returned to
  Harry.</p>

  <p>His eyes were closed, his lips bloodless, and through the grime his face
  was grey. With a gasp of horror she thought he was dead, but when she put her
  hand under his waistcoat she could feel the faint flutter of his heart. He
  had an electric torch somewhere in his pocket, he had told her, and she began
  to search. It necessitated moving him slightly, and as she did so he groaned.
  The lamp was in the tail pocket of his frock-coat, a square, flat lamp, of a
  type usually to be found in every room of Fossaway Manor.</p>

  <p>She thought at first that the unconscious man carried two, but found that
  the second package was a spare battery. Switching on the light, she examined
  the roof above the broken stairs. She saw it was the underside of a slab of
  wood. From here she could see the rollers on which the table ran; stout
  things of wood. Near the head of the stairs two large wooden grips projected
  downwards, rather like the butts of huge Browning pistols, and she guessed
  that by this means the table was drawn back from below.</p>

  <p>When she looked at Harry again he was staring upward with wondering
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We must have fallen through a trap," she said. "Do you think you could
  reach those handles?" She pointed to them.</p>

  <p>He rose unsteadily to his feet, replaced his spectacles, which had been
  knocked off in his fall, and looked at the butts. Only two of the treads
  remained intact. He tried one, but it broke under his feet and the supporting
  posts were sagging.</p>

  <p>"I can't reach that," he said. "It must be twelve feet high."</p>

  <p>Then she noticed his wound and made him sit down while she dressed it with
  a strip of silk torn from her skirt.</p>

  <p>"How on earth did we get into this beastly place?" he asked, wondering.
  "Where are we?"</p>

  <p>"We're under the abbey," she said, and his frown ended in a grimace of
  pain.</p>

  <p>"Where is Dick?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He is up there, I think," she said.</p>

  <p>And yet why should Dick be there? He would not know his way into the lower
  chamber, she thought, with a sinking heart.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you can walk?"</p>

  <p>He looked round in dismay.</p>

  <p>"I can walk all right, but whither?"</p>

  <p>"Let us try the left-hand passage first," she suggested, and he was
  agreeable.</p>

  <p>The left-hand passage, they found, was a steep ascent which turned
  continuously to the left. It was like one of those corkscrew tunnels through
  which she had travelled in Switzerland, where the train burrows its way
  upwards in the heart of the solid rock. Was it above Montreux or on Pilatus?
  She was too tired to think.</p>

  <p>At the first turn she stopped. She had seen a glimmer of light, and,
  making an inspection, she found a square hole, cut apparently in the rock;
  the further end was covered with hanging weeds, and through these she saw the
  light distinctly, a faint yellow glow. They continued their climb, and
  presently came to another small opening. Here, then, was one of the sources
  of air supply, though little came this way, for when she lit a match before
  it the flame scarcely wavered.</p>

  <p>"How much farther are we going?" asked Harry faintly. "I'm nearly all
  in."</p>

  <p>"We must go on," she said. "This probably brings us to the open air
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>He put his hand on her shoulder, and, walking slowly, they made another
  complete turn of the winding passage, and this time they found an air-hole
  that was not weed-covered. The light was stronger now, and, looking through,
  she thought she saw a swaying cord. And she heard something too &mdash;
  voices. It was not an illusion; somebody was talking at an immense distance
  away, it seemed. She looked again. The cord seemed very near, but when she
  thrust her hand through the opening and tried to grasp it, she knew that she
  had been the victim of an optical illusion. She called out, but there was no
  answer. She must have imagined the voices.</p>

  <p>And then she heard a faint shout and the yellow light which had shone
  through the entrance went out.</p>

  <p>"I can't go any farther." Harry collapsed against the wall and slid down
  into a sitting position, his head on his breast.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I leave you in the dark?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head wearily, and, leaving him, she continued the climb, and
  presently found herself in a straight, narrow passage. At some period an
  attempt had been made to dress the sides with stone slabs. The wall was
  littered with crumbling fragments of stone, and gaps showed where age and the
  action of the damp had detached the dressing from the walls. As near as she
  could judge, she was moving away from the abbey in the direction of Fossaway
  Manor.</p>

  <p>This latter was a guess. It was impossible that it could lead towards the
  cut road to the north of the estate. Then the explanation came to her; she
  was passing under the Mound, the high bank that fringed the Ravensrill. What
  light feet had trodden this way? she wondered. What fears or hopes, desire or
  despair, had sped along this rough stone floor? Unconsciously she was
  reconstructing an ancient cause and effect. The effect brought her to a
  standstill. Right across the passage a wall had been built; a solid barrier
  of masonry which checked all further progress.</p>

  <p>Though she did not know and could not guess, here was the obstacle that
  the revengeful Lord of Chelford had set up after his assassin had gone forth
  to slay the man who had dishonoured him. No more would the light steps of
  frail womanhood trip along this secret passage, and since Yvonne of Chelford
  had died of a broken heart no woman's foot had stirred this dust.</p>

  <p>Leslie turned back, her courage failing. Approaching the spot where she
  had left Harry, she heard his soft chuckle and her skin crept.</p>

  <p>"Leslie, Leslie!" he whispered eagerly. "You have no idea what a bit of
  good luck I've had!"</p>

  <p>And when he came into the light of her lamp he was his old exalted
  self.</p>

  <p>"What do you think happened?"</p>

  <p>She was conscious now of voices. She heard somebody shout and a faint
  answer, but faint as it was, she recognised the voice. It was Dick's.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?' she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>He doubled up with silent laughter and could not speak for a minute, and
  then he showed her a knife.</p>

  <p>"With that," he said complacently. "I saw him go down&mdash;and then the
  rope came near&mdash;I could have touched it. Then I remembered I had my
  knife, and I reached through, and before they could pull it away I'd cut
  it."</p>

  <p>She gazed at him in horror.</p>

  <p>"Was somebody on the rope?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>He nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"The arch-enemy of the human race," he said in a sober tone. "Richard
  Alford."</p>

  <p>Petrified with terror, she put her ear to the hole and heard Dick
  speaking. Then without a word she fled down the slope. Round and round the
  circular passage she went until she was almost dizzy. Presently she reached
  the lower air-hole, put through her hand and tore away the veiling weeds.</p>

  <p>"Dick, Dick!" she called.</p>

  <p>She could see him now for the air-hole was just above water level. His
  face was grey and drawn.</p>

  <p>"Dick!"</p>

  <p>She thrust out her hand and presently closed it about his ice-cold wrist,
  and at that moment Harry's hand fell on her shoulder and she was dragged
  backwards. She felt the wrist slip, she heard the splash of water as Dick
  Alford fell, and fainted.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch60"
     name="ch60"></a>CHAPTER LX</h2>

  <p class="first">SHE woke, and it was so dark she could not believe her eyes
  were open until she felt the lids. There was no sound. She was lying on the
  hard, uneven floor where she had fallen, she thought, but when she put out
  her hand to feel for the air-hole, her fingers touched rough rock. Groping
  round for the flash-lamp, she found nothing. Presently, however, she touched
  a smooth, cold surface. It was Harry's knife, a long-bladed clasp knife.</p>

  <p>And then she remembered clearly. Dick was in the water, drowning. She
  struggled to her feet, trembling in every limb.</p>

  <p>Dead perhaps. She staggered blindly forward and came in contact with the
  wall. Gripping her hands till the nails cut the palms she strove to regain
  her self-control. He would be rescued; there were men with him, she told
  herself, and became calmer and again sat down, so that her back was to the
  wall, and waited, the open knife on her lap. Feeling in her pocket for a
  handkerchief, her hand touched the matchbox, and she took it out with a sense
  of gratitude.</p>

  <p>She was weary to the point of exhaustion. The rough flooring had slashed
  the soles of her silk stockings to ribbons and her feet were terribly sore.
  She waited for some time before she struck her first match, for the box was
  already half empty. She saw that she was in a part of this underground system
  which was unfamiliar to her. The roof was higher; the walls bulged in like
  the sides of an hourglass, and the floor had been roughly paved. At intervals
  there seemed to be niches, alcoves in the wall, and again she thought of the
  Swiss tunnels with their safety niches. There was no sign of the lamp;
  evidently Harry had carried that with him when he had gone off. It was not
  like him to leave her; even in his delirium he would not have done that, she
  thought.</p>

  <p>As the match burnt out she heard halting footsteps re-echoing down the
  passage, and, closing the knife, she slipped it into her jacket pocket and
  waited. He must have been a long way from her when she first heard him; the
  passage acting as a huge speaking-tube.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right, Leslie?" He was normal again. "I'm sorry I had to
  leave you, but this place rather rattles me, and I had to go along and see if
  I could find an exit."</p>

  <p>"Where are we?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I carried you down that wretched circular arrangement, and
  you were fearfully heavy," he added, so naïvely that the girl laughed for the
  first time in that period of horror. "Do you know, Leslie"&mdash;he squatted
  down on the floor by her side&mdash;"I have an idea. Do you remember those
  holes we looked through?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember them," she said, wondering what was coming next.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that they are placed in the side of a well of some kind?"</p>

  <p>Not a word about Dick. He had forgotten the rope-cutting and the horror
  that followed.</p>

  <p>"Has it occurred to you," he went on, "that the treasure may be at the
  bottom of that well? It only struck me a few minutes ago. If we could get out
  and have a talk with Dick, he's such an ingenious devil that I'm sure he
  would find the opening of the well, which may be inside the old abbey itself.
  Most of these mediaeval buildings had a well in the centre and kept their
  water supply enclosed."</p>

  <p>"You didn't find an exit?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "I got into a sort of labyrinth and I thought I should
  never get out again. Good heavens! Look at your feet!"</p>

  <p>They were indeed in a sorry plight, swollen and bleeding. In an instant he
  had pulled off his own shoes.</p>

  <p>"Put them on," he said authoritatively, and when she demurred, he seized
  her foot and slipped her toes into the shoe. "I was a great runner in my
  day," he said, with a hint of pride, "and barefooted running was my
  speciality &mdash; to use a horrible theatrical word."</p>

  <p>The shoes were much too big for her, but the comfort of them after walking
  barefooted on that rough floor!</p>

  <p>"There's one place I haven't explored, and that is the little side passage
  to the left. There has been some sort of a fall there and the rock looks
  rotten. I didn't like to attempt an exploration. By the way, what made you
  faint?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;nerves, I suppose," she said.</p>

  <p>It was useless and even dangerous to tell him of what had happened by the
  wall of the well.</p>

  <p>"I thought it might be that," he said. "If you feel fitter now we'll go
  along."</p>

  <p>He walked ahead, switching his lamp on and off at intervals. He wanted to
  economise his batteries, he told her, which had shown signs of running out.
  All the time he kept up an incessant chatter. He had plans about the future
  of the abbey and grew enthusiastic when he expounded his scheme.</p>

  <p>"This is not even a Saxon-English burrow, but probably goes back to the
  days of the original inhabitants of Britain," he said. "We are walking in
  paths that were originally cut by cavemen. Doesn't that thrill you,
  Leslie?"</p>

  <p>"Terribly," she said, with unconscious irony.</p>

  <p>"I'll have the place wired and lit; it will be necessary to increase the
  electric supply, but Dick will see to that. I may present it to the nation or
  to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners&mdash;I'm not certain which. There is no
  doubt from an archaeological point of view&mdash;"</p>

  <p>So he talked on and she followed him, sometimes listening, sometimes her
  mind occupied with the agony of thought. Was Dick safe? She was sure that he
  was not alone; there were men at the top of the well, and they would save
  him. It was not possible that Dick Alford should die in that dark place, that
  his splendid life should be ended so tragically. The walking was tiring, for
  they were climbing all the time.</p>

  <p>They must have covered about a quarter of a mile when he stopped.</p>

  <p>"Here is the side passage," he said, and warned her: "Don't go into it;
  the stones are still falling."</p>

  <p>He put his light into the hole&mdash;it was no more&mdash;and she saw a
  great heap of fallen rock in the middle of the path. There was just room
  between the top of the heap and the roof to crawl through. But what she
  noticed instantly was the strong current of air that fanned her cheeks when
  she stopped to look through the aperture.</p>

  <p>"This must be the way, Harry," she said instantly; "can't you feel the
  air?"</p>

  <p>"I noticed that," he agreed, but was reluctant to enter this unpromising
  byway.</p>

  <p>"We must go, Harry. There's no other way out," she said. "We are getting
  farther and farther down, away from the abbey, and, as you say, beyond here
  is only a labyrinth that brings you back to the place from where you
  started."</p>

  <p>"All right," he agreed, with evident distaste. "I had better go
  first."</p>

  <p>He crawled gingerly over the pile of stones and slid down on the other
  side.</p>

  <p>She heard his voice.</p>

  <p>"It is all right here," he said, and then the light of his lamp showed and
  she followed him.</p>

  <p>The passage was very high; it was a natural fissure in the rock. Yet the
  hand of man must have been here, for the floor had been levelled, and there
  was evidence of animal life. A long black shape scudded across the path and
  disappeared through a hole. The girl gave a little scream and shrank
  back.</p>

  <p>"It is only a weasel," said Harry calmly. "Where a weasel can get, we can
  get."</p>

  <p>The passage had widened, and now the work of man became evident. They were
  in a square chamber: the roof was of vaulted stone that seemed to bulge
  downwards, as if it supported a weight beyond its capacity, but this was
  hidden by the long stalactites that flashed in the light of the lantern. And
  she shivered. It was extraordinarily cold, almost as if they had come into an
  ice-house.</p>

  <p>"No door and no doorway. I wonder what the idea of this place was."</p>

  <p>It was the first man-made chamber they had seen. The walls were running
  with water, wet and shining; the roof dripped incessantly, but only one small
  pool of water gathered on the floor; the rest ran off in a central chamber
  and apparently into the solid rock.</p>

  <p>"The dripping of water wears away stone," quoted Harry, and pointed to the
  floor with its tiny saucer-shaped depression.</p>

  <p>There was no sign of a door at either entrance, and he went ahead of her
  through the arched entrance, covered a few yards, and stopped, looking
  upwards.</p>

  <p>"Daylight!" he said.</p>

  <p>The first thing of which she was conscious was that, away from the little
  room, she was warm again.</p>

  <p>The shaft that worked upwards was a natural fissure. They could see the
  rough edges of rock jutting out at intervals. In some places it was wide
  enough to hold a full-sized man; in other places it was so narrow that only
  an arm could have reached through. But there it was, the clear, uninterrupted
  view of the sky, and the girl beheld a phenomenon with which miners are
  familiar, the view of a white, winking star, in broad daylight.</p>

  <p>"That is where the air comes from," said Harry. "Now we'll try where this
  passage leads."</p>

  <p>It led to a blank wall of solid rock, he found. They stared at one another
  in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"We must try back," said Harry.</p>

  <p>Hardly were the words out of his mouth than there was a distant rumble and
  roar, the ground beneath their feet shook, and down the passageway through
  which they had reached the Cold Room swept a cloud of flying dust.</p>

  <p>"Wait," he said, and flew along the passage.</p>

  <p>He was gone a few minutes before he returned. She could not see his face
  except from the reflected light he threw upon the floor to guide him on his
  way.</p>

  <p>"The roof has fallen in," he said, and there was a tremor in his voice. "I
  am afraid, Leslie, we are finished!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch61"
     name="ch61"></a>CHAPTER LXI</h2>

  <p class="first">A HOT bath and a meal, though every morsel seemed to choke
  him, restored Dick Alford to something like himself. There was
  hope&mdash;faint indeed, but still hope. He had despatched his bailiff in
  search of explosives, but explosives cannot be bought over the counter like
  cheese and bacon. He had a telephone message from the man to say that he was
  on his way to London and would return with the necessary apparatus. Dick's
  plan was simple; even then a derrick was being rigged over the well; his plan
  was to dynamite the wall of the well and to get into the gallery.</p>

  <p>"For a long time I've been suspicious that the rock on which the abbey was
  built was honeycombed with passages. My father told me something about it,
  and I've seen an old plan that shows an elaborate system of corridors, though
  the family has always thought this was largely imaginative on the part of the
  artist."</p>

  <p>"Have you the plan now?" asked Gilder.</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Harry took everything of that nature away with him the night he left the
  house."</p>

  <p>"It is not amongst the books you found in the underground room?" said
  Puttler, and a search was made of the library, but without success.</p>

  <p>They were on their way to the ruins when Puttler saw the aeroplane in the
  sky. It circled twice and then began to dip steeply.</p>

  <p>"I believe that fellow is coming here," he said.</p>

  <p>And so it proved. The machine roared its progress for a hundred yards or
  more, and then dropped. Presently they saw a man get down. Though he wore an
  airman's helmet, Dick recognised him. It was Arthur Gine.</p>

  <p>He met Gilder's scowl with a little laugh.</p>

  <p>"I've got some money of yours, Gilder," he said, and dragged with some
  difficulty a huge packet from the pocket of his leather coat. "That is more
  or less the amount I owe you, unless the franc has depreciated in value since
  I left Paris. And now you can do your damnedest!"</p>

  <p>Gilder took the packet without a word and Arthur turned to Dick
  Alford.</p>

  <p>"I read about Leslie in the French papers," he said simply, "and so I came
  back. Has she been found?"</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea where she is?"</p>

  <p>Dick told him all that had happened that afternoon, and Arthur Gine
  listened in silence. When Dick came to speak of his plan, he shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I had my early training as an engineer before I went into the law," he
  said, "and I tell you, from my elementary knowledge of the science, that
  you're likely to blow in the whole well, and if there's anybody on the other
  side, God help them!"</p>

  <p>He accompanied them to the lower room and was swung down on the derrick to
  make an inspection. When he returned to the surface his report was not very
  promising.</p>

  <p>"So far as I can see," he said, "whilst you may enlarge the opening of any
  of these air-holes, you may also bring about a fall of the rock inside.
  You're dealing with surfaces which have been exposed to the chemical action
  of the air."</p>

  <p>He went down and made an inspection of the lower room, which was new to
  him, and, as they had done, tried to pull the table aside. And then he did
  what they had not attempted; he pushed at the table at one end and felt it
  move, at first slowly and then quickly, as though he had set in motion a
  counterweight. He had just time to swing himself on the table and grip its
  edge when the aperture appeared under his feet.</p>

  <p>Dick saw the broken stair, and, sitting on the edge of the hole, dropped
  through to the rocky floor just as the table slid into its place. They pushed
  it back again and propped it, and Arthur and Gilder joined him below,
  carrying lanterns. He saw a piece of something dark on the floor and picked
  it up. It was a strip of silk.</p>

  <p>"This is the way," he said quietly. "I'll work to the left; you go to the
  right, Gilder."</p>

  <p>Arthur made a rapid mental calculation.</p>

  <p>"The left passage will lead you to the well, and unless I'm very much
  mistaken you will find the air-holes on your right-hand side. If you don't
  mind, I'll go with you."</p>

  <p>The men ascended the treacherous slope and came to the first of the
  air-holes, continued up until they reached the straight passage down which
  Leslie had made her fruitless journey. They too were brought to a halt by the
  wall barrier, and returned the way they had come. There was no sign of Leslie
  or Harry, but when Dick passed the alcove down which he had dropped from the
  Abbot's room he found a burnt match-stalk.</p>

  <p>He ascended again, a long, steady climb.</p>

  <p>"We're near the surface of the ground," said Arthur.</p>

  <p>Ahead of them the star lamp of Gilder showed. He was coming back to meet
  them.</p>

  <p>"This passage ends in a sort of maze," he reported. "There is a side
  passage, but that's entirely blocked by stone."</p>

  <p>They went back with him to the place and Arthur Gine examined the
  debris.</p>

  <p>"The roof has fallen in here," he said. "How long ago it is impossible to
  tell. This stone is old, but I should think that the fall has been going on
  for years."</p>

  <p>They returned dispirited, and accompanied Gilder on his exploration of the
  maze. Though they tried passage after passage, they invariably found
  themselves back at the place where they had started. Dick made another
  inspection of the fallen roof. It had collapsed a few feet from the entrance;
  and, though he did not know this, there were twenty yards of crumbled rock
  between him and the little chamber where Leslie Gine was waiting for
  death.</p>

  <p>Dick came out into the light of the setting sun, his haggard face white
  with dust. Arthur sat on a stone, his head in his hands, the picture of
  despair. Even Gilder was shaken from his habitual calm, could do no more than
  stare tragically at the ruin which hid so much. The broken arch of the
  window, red in the light of the setting sun, was more than ever like a query
  mark. There was something devilish about it, something which epitomised the
  spirit that leered and mocked at them.</p>

  <p>"Come back to the house," said Dick steadily, and, to the bailiff who
  approached him: "No, I shan't want the dynamite&mdash;yet."</p>

  <p>They walked dispiritedly along the Mound, Arthur Gine, the most dejected
  of all, walking in the rear. Suddenly they heard him shout and turned. He was
  pointing across the river.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Dick, hurrying back to him.</p>

  <p>"The wishing well&mdash;have you thought of that?" gasped Arthur.</p>

  <p>"The wishing well?"</p>

  <p>And then Dick remembered that rendezvous of the country swains, the
  unfathomable crevice in the earth down which, as a boy, he had dropped
  stones, listening to hear them strike from rock to rock until they grew
  fainter.</p>

  <p>"That reaches somewhere," said Arthur excitedly. "We can but try it."</p>

  <p>Dick ran down to the bank, plunged into the water and waded through to the
  other side. The two men followed him, and something whispered in Dick
  Alford's heart that this was his last hope.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch62"
     name="ch62"></a>CHAPTER LXII</h2>

  <p class="first">"WHAT time is it?" asked Harry.</p>

  <p>He had not spoken for two hours, but had sat, clasping his knees, his head
  thrust forward, engaged with his wild thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Lend me the lantern."</p>

  <p>She passed the lamp back to him.</p>

  <p>"A quarter to seven," she said. "Harry I feel so hungry."</p>

  <p>"Do you?" he asked in surprise. "I don't feel hungry. I feel&mdash;I don't
  know."</p>

  <p>Presently he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"How did we get here?" he asked. "I know the roof fell in, but how did we
  come into this beastly place?"</p>

  <p>"You've been very ill," she said gently. "You came here whilst you were
  sick."</p>

  <p>"Did I really?" He seemed amazed at her reply and did not speak again for
  fully five minutes. "I seem to remember now that I have been ill. I sleep so
  badly and have such horrible dreams. Poor old Dick was always ragging me
  about my patent medicines&mdash;queer bird, old Dick, but one of the very
  best."</p>

  <p>He spoke so heartily, with such enthusiasm, that her heart ached for some
  unknown reason.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to get out of here," he said.</p>

  <p>She did not answer him.</p>

  <p>For the tenth time he turned on the light of his lamp and examined the
  roof.</p>

  <p>"It is vaulted," he muttered. "I hope nothing happens here."</p>

  <p>She felt him shivering.</p>

  <p>"Nothing is going to happen, Harry," she said soothingly. "We're going to
  get out and we're going to have a big dinner to celebrate our rescue."</p>

  <p>He chuckled softly.</p>

  <p>"We shall never get out of here," he said cheerfully. "This is the end of
  the House of Chelford." He thought a while. "By Jove, no! Of course, Dick
  will inherit the estate. Isn't it queer, Leslie, that he never wanted me to
  marry? That's the only thing about Dick I cannot understand, because he's not
  a jealous man or an envious man, but a good, big-hearted fellow&mdash;and yet
  he didn't want me to marry. Doesn't that seem strange to you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think you're right, Harry," she temporised. "Only he didn't want
  you to marry the wrong woman."</p>

  <p>"But he didn't want me to marry you," said Harry in a tone of indignation.
  "And if there's a better girl in the world than you, I'd like to find her! Of
  course I'm a terrible slacker, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hullo!"</p>

  <p>The booming voice seemed to come from somebody in the chamber. She felt
  him start, and again his frail body quavered in a fit of trembling.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" he asked huskily.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!"</p>

  <p>The voice came again. She seized the lamp from his hand and ran out of the
  cavern to the place where she had seen daylight.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Dick?" she called at the top of her voice, and heard a husky
  "Thank God!"</p>

  <p>And then from the Cold Room came a burst of demoniacal laughter. There was
  yet the gravest danger of all to overcome. She was alone with a madman!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch63"
     name="ch63"></a>CHAPTER LXIII</h2>

  <p class="first">SHE could see no daylight, and thought that night must have
  fallen, until a patch of golden red appeared high above her.</p>

  <p>"Is Harry with you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied. "One moment."</p>

  <p>She went back to find him cowering against the wall, and gripped him by
  the shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Harry," she said pleadingly, "they have found us!"</p>

  <p>He scowled up at her.</p>

  <p>"Who have found us?"</p>

  <p>"Dick&mdash;everybody. We shan't have long to wait now."</p>

  <p>He licked his lips.</p>

  <p>"Dick and everybody," he said dully. "That is strange&mdash;found us!"</p>

  <p>She flew back to the little shaft.</p>

  <p>"Are you hungry?" boomed the voice. "Very," she answered. "But that
  doesn't matter&mdash;I can live without food for another twelve hours. We're
  in a sort of underground room. The roof of the passage has fallen in."</p>

  <p>"How long is the passage?" asked Dick quickly.</p>

  <p>She thought a moment.</p>

  <p>"About forty yards, I think. It cannot be much less."</p>

  <p>"How far from your end is it blocked?" and when she told him, she heard
  him groan.</p>

  <p>"Leslie."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sending something down to you at the end of a string. It is a pocket
  compass. Will you tell me exactly the bearings?"</p>

  <p>It reached her at last, battered, its glass broken. She put the little
  instrument on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Put it where I can see it," he said. "Have you a light?"</p>

  <p>She flashed the lamp upon it.</p>

  <p>"Where is the north? Just touch the place with your finger. Wait, I will
  send for field-glasses."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes passed, and then he said again: "Now show me." And when she
  had indicated the north, he asked her where the cavern was.</p>

  <p>"Exactly west," she said with tremulous triumph. "Will it be a long time
  before you reach us?"</p>

  <p>He made no answer to this.</p>

  <p>"Tell me how many paces you are from the compass," and when she had paced
  it off and had told him, he groaned.</p>

  <p>By this time the consulting engineer to whom he had telephoned in the
  afternoon was on the spot.</p>

  <p>"The cavern is exactly under the bed of the river," said that
  official.</p>

  <p>"Could we enlarge this hole?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>The surveyor shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Impossible. It would take you the best part of a month to blast a way
  down. There's a long fault in the rock here which accounts for the river's
  course," he added. "Both banks are solid; I can assure you on that point,
  because my predecessor bored for water for your respected father."</p>

  <p>Dick groaned. He could keep the girl alive for a month, but the strain of
  it would kill her. Then there flashed simultaneously to two minds a
  solution.</p>

  <p>"Why not break the dam of the Ravensrill?" he said, and Puttler, who had
  the words on his lips, nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's the idea," he said. "Undo the work of your ancestor! Turn the
  course of the river to the Long Meadow&mdash;there's a natural bed for
  it!"</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later the telephone at Fossaway Manor was busy, and here Mary
  Wenner was a heaven-sent helper. Every great contractor within twenty miles
  had his instructions, and within an hour charabancs, motorcars, omnibuses,
  crowded with horny-handed workmen, were lumbering up the drive. Car succeeded
  car, and disgorged the fustian-clad navvies. They had been taken from
  ale-houses, from their homes, from workmen's clubs, drawn even from the
  cinemas of distant Brighton, and every hour the number swelled, until there
  were a thousand men working by the light of naphtha flares on the great dump
  behind Fossaway Manor.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock the omnibuses and lorries were still rolling up the drive;
  trolleys laden with wheelbarrows and tools were being rapidly unloaded at the
  side of the dump. All southern Sussex worked to cut the dam of the
  Ravensrill, and the big dump grew smaller and smaller. Presently, as the
  water rose, it spilled into the bed that it had left for hundreds of years
  and flowed its irregular course, sweeping aside barns that had been hastily
  evacuated, lapping the walls of one cottage, the inhabitants of which had
  been removed in time. Little by little the water in the old bed sank and sank
  until it was a dark mass of weeds and silvery shapes that leapt up and down
  in extremis. Water voles, trout, pike were shovelled to the bank, and the bed
  of the river attacked by men who worked at fever pace, being relieved every
  half-hour.</p>

  <p>"If there is rock there," said the surveyor, "we are dished! My own belief
  is that there's nothing but sand."</p>

  <p>"And shingle?" suggested Puttler.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, there's no shingle. It is a curious fact that we've never found
  shingle in the Ravensrill. They've struck the sand now," he said, looking
  down into the hole, which the men were shoring with logs of timber. "And I'm
  glad there is no shingle&mdash;sand is much easier to work."</p>

  <p>He had hardly spoken the words before the foreman shouted: "We've struck
  shingle here, governor!"</p>

  <p>"Shingle?" The surveyor went down the ladder into the hole.</p>

  <p>"It is only a layer," he said when he came back, "but even that is rather
  surprising. It opens up all sorts of possibilities."</p>

  <p>Dick did not listen. The value of shingle to a county surveyor was of no
  more interest to him than the value of sand to a grocer.</p>

  <p>The work was now heavier. A derrick and windlass had to be rigged to move
  the heavy loads from the cutting, and that took a considerable time, during
  which he paid frequent visits to the "wishing well."</p>

  <p>It was after the shingle had been discovered that Harry's voice answered
  him.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Dick? What are you fellows doing up there?"</p>

  <p>The voice held all the old irritation and fretfulness. Briefly Dick
  described what was happening.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you send me something down so that I could work below?" asked
  Harry. "I'm perfectly sure I could make it much easier for you."</p>

  <p>To humour him, Dick Alford found a light crowbar and with great difficulty
  lowered it. Because of its shape and size, the operation was a painfully slow
  one, and Harry fretted and fumed below.</p>

  <p>"Hurry, for heaven's sake," he shouted. "You don't suppose I want to stay
  down here, do you? I've a tremendous lot of work to do&mdash;you know that,
  Dick, very well."</p>

  <p>Dick did not answer, but his anxiety increased. He knew Harry and his
  symptoms all too well to be under any illusion as to what would follow if his
  irritation grew beyond the power of restraint, and it was with a sigh of
  thankfulness that he felt the crowbar caught in the eager hands of his
  brother.</p>

  <p>"Be very careful how you use this," he called. "The men are working from
  above and you may have a fall unless you take the greatest care."</p>

  <p>But he was talking to the air. Harry had gone and it was Leslie who
  answered him.</p>

  <p>"How long will you be, Dick?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, my dear. A few hours, not longer. Are you all right?"</p>

  <p>A little hesitation.m</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm all right."</p>

  <p>"Is Harry?"</p>

  <p>A longer pause.</p>

  <p>"I think so. Is it possible to send something down that he could
  take?"</p>

  <p>Earlier in the evening Dick had tried to pass the end of a thin rubber
  tube to the imprisoned pair, but the attempt had been futile.</p>

  <p>"I'll try," he said, and went in search of one of the two doctors who had
  been summoned.</p>

  <p>From him he obtained two small brown pellets, and these, wrapped in paper
  and weighted, were dropped into the wishing well.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said her low voice. "I don't know how I can use them, and for
  the moment he is very busy."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch64"
     name="ch64"></a>CHAPTER LXIV</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was no question as to Harry's activity. He had rolled
  a heavy boulder from the debris in the passage, and, placing it in the centre
  of the floor, he could reach the stone roof, which was in six petal-shaped
  sectors. The lens of his lamp had been removed so that the light was
  diffused, and Leslie had a better view of the room.</p>

  <p>There were little holes at intervals that looked as if they had once held
  hat-pegs, though why anybody should come into these depths to hang up their
  hats she could not imagine. And then the real value of this peculiar chamber
  occurred to her. She found against the wall a long, rusty hook, so thin that
  she could break it. This had been the meat store of the abbey, the mediaeval
  equivalent to a refrigerator. The atmosphere was deathly cold. It seemed a
  very long way from the abbey, but in reality it was not more than a hundred
  and fifty yards. The old monks had found this cavern, had dressed and
  strengthened it, had lined and converted it to their own use. That explained
  why this chamber, so far distant from the main building, had received the
  ancient architects' attention.</p>

  <p>Harry was in his shirtsleeves, which were rolled up, revealing his thin
  but sinewy arms. He had managed to get the claw of the crowbar between two of
  the stones, and was working at them gradually, talking the while to himself
  in an undertone. Her anxiety increased. The paroxysm, when it came, would be
  short, but what would be the end of it? Her mouth went dry and she felt for
  the knife she had put in her pocket, and stealthily opening the blade, thrust
  it through the lining to keep it in place.</p>

  <p>Presently Harry paused, wiped the perspiration from his forehead with his
  arm and looked down at her. His horn-rimmed spectacles had slipped down his
  nose and he stopped to adjust them.</p>

  <p>"Dick has no intention whatever of rescuing us. I think that you ought to
  know that."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you're mistaken, Harry," she said.</p>

  <p>But opposition only made him worse and he snapped down at her: "You're a
  fool! All women are fools! I tell you it is a plot. Dick has no more
  intention of rescuing us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly and passed his hand across his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I wish I had brought the picture," he muttered, and glared at her. "But
  for you I should have taken it with me, and now I've left it behind for that
  swine to jeer at!"</p>

  <p>She looked up at the roof.</p>

  <p>"You're doing splendidly, Harry," and, his attention distracted, he
  attacked the roof again.</p>

  <p>"You can trust me, Leslie," he said. "I am the only person in the world
  you can trust. You have no enemies. The Black Abbot is dead! I killed him,
  and I am very proud of the fact. Every Chelford should kill at least one
  Black Abbot, and I have had the approval of my illustrious ancestor."</p>

  <p>By this time the claw of the crowbar had been worked deep into the crevice
  he had made, and he began to lever slowly. As she watched him she saw the
  stone move. It dropped suddenly an eighth of an inch, and he raised an
  excited shout.</p>

  <p>"You see, you see!" he said, in his shrill voice. "Dick never dreamt I
  would be able to do that, or he would not have allowed me to use this
  crowbar."</p>

  <p>He got down from the stone, scooped up two handfuls of water from the worn
  channel and drank, dashing the remainder of the water into his face before he
  leapt again on the stone and went to work with renewed vigour. Backward and
  forward he levered the crowbar, and again the stone dropped, until it was
  perceptibly out of place.</p>

  <p>"You must be careful Harry," she warned him. "That may come down with a
  rush and hurt you."</p>

  <p>He was sensible enough to see this, changed the position of the stone and
  worked from the other angle. And then, without warning, all that she had
  predicted happened. He leapt aside into the open doorway as with a crash the
  sector fell and broke into fragments on the stone pavement.</p>

  <p>"You see, you see!" he screamed. "I've done it!"</p>

  <p>A steady shower of shingle was falling. He struck upwards with the point
  of his crowbar, and the shower increased until it made a heap on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>And then he saw the edge of a box.</p>

  <p>"Look, look, look!"</p>

  <p>His trembling hands could scarcely hold the tool. With the energy of
  dementia he dug away at the shingle beneath it, and presently, gripping it by
  the edge, he pulled it clear. It was a tin chest, a miniature of those she
  had seen at Fossaway Manor, six inches, in length, four inches broad and as
  deep. With his crowbar he prised open the lid and the rusted iron hasp parted
  with a snap. Inside was what appeared to be a bundle of discoloured cloth. He
  lifted it out.</p>

  <p>"There's something heavy here," he said hoarsely, and his hands shook so
  that in pity she came forward and helped unwrap the thing that the box held.
  Presently it came to light; a long flask containing a colourless fluid. The
  bottle was heavily sealed at the top.</p>

  <p>He snatched it from her hand, a frenzied gleam in the staring eyes.</p>

  <p>"The Elixir!" he croaked. "The Life Water! Oh, God be thanked!"</p>

  <p>She tried to take it from him, but he snarled round on her like an angry
  dog.</p>

  <p>"You devil!" he screamed. "You're in league with Dick! You're trying to
  rob me of life! But you shan't, you shan't!"</p>

  <p>The flask was corked with a piece of wood that had swollen. He dragged at
  it with his teeth and presently extracted the stopper.</p>

  <p>"I shall live eternally! But you shall die! He shall find you here dead,
  and realise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He put the flask to his lips and drank. She covered her eyes with her
  hands, then, as he moved, gripped the knife.</p>

  <p>And then she heard something drop with a heavy crash to the floor and
  looked. The shingle was still sliding down like sand in an hour-glass, but
  now something big and heavy thudded to the ground. It looked ludicrously like
  a yellow candle, but its weight was such that the first bar struck the
  pavement and the impact bent it hook-shaped. Another followed. She watched,
  fascinated as they came, first slowly, then in a stream, from the triangular
  space in the roof&mdash;scores, hundreds of yellow candles thundering down in
  twos and threes amidst the flow of shingle.</p>

  <p>"The gold, the gold!" screamed Harry. "But he shall never have it!"</p>

  <p>He lifted the lamp, but as his arm rose she stooped swiftly. The crash of
  the lamp as it struck the wall came to her and she crouched back towards the
  wishing well. She heard a loud crash in the chamber; a sector of the roof had
  given under the strain, and now, with a hiss and a rush, shingle and ingots
  were falling until they almost filled the room. They flowed about her feet
  like a heavy stream. She struggled to get it underfoot and became more and
  more engulfed.</p>

  <p>"Dick, Dick!" she screamed, but he did not hear her.</p>

  <p>He had reached the broken roof of the Cold Room and was slipping and
  sliding down the heap of shingle under which lay a man who was dead before
  the torrent of stone was loosened. Later they found him, gripping a crystal
  flask in his hand. What it had contained no man ever knew.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch65"
     name="ch65"></a>CHAPTER LXV</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Leslie Gine woke, the sunlight was peeping round the
  edges of the drawn blinds. She sat up suddenly and her head went round and
  round. And then she remembered and her eyes closed, as if to shut out some
  horrible sight.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are awake?" said Mary Wenner, bustling in. "Dick sent me up to
  see how you were. Everybody's most fearfully anxious about you&mdash;even
  Fab, though I'm not of a jealous disposition, as everybody knows."</p>

  <p>"What is the time?"</p>

  <p>Then, with a shiver she remembered that somebody else had asked her that.
  How long ago? An eternity!</p>

  <p>"Twelve thirty-five," said Miss Wenner, consulting her watch. "I've been
  out looking at the workmen. Really, my dear, it's more like a Desirable
  Residential Estate than the grounds of Fossaway Manor. Wheelbarrows and
  navvies and goodness knows what! They say it's cost his lordship twenty
  thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Leslie looked at her in wonder.</p>

  <p>"His lordship?" she said in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>"I mean Dick," said the calm Miss Wenner. "The King is dead, long live the
  King! That's my motto every time." And then, in a more sober tone&mdash;and
  rather ashamed of herself for her heartlessness: "Poor boy! It was a mercy
  for him. Fabe's gone back to London."</p>

  <p>"Who is Fabe? Oh, Mr Gilder!" said the girl, smiling faintly.</p>

  <p>Miss Wenner dropped her eyes modestly.</p>

  <p>"We are engaged. It was all his idea, because, as you know, Leslie
  darling, I'm not the sort of girl to throw myself at any man's head. But he's
  persuaded me." She sighed heavily. "I suppose I'd better. I'm getting on in
  years, and a girl can't always be pretty."</p>

  <p>Leslie brought her feet to the floor and stood up. She was still a little
  unsteady, and the pain in her feet was atrocious, in spite of the dressing
  that the doctor had applied.</p>

  <p>"I must say that Arthur took it very well," said Miss Wenner as she
  assisted the girl to dress. "It was naturally a great blow to him."</p>

  <p>"What was?" Leslie was a little dazed.</p>

  <p>"My engagement," said Mary. "You didn't know." She sighed. "Arthur was
  very fond of me, I'll admit it. But in the circumstances I don't think it
  would be nice to marry a gentleman who's bad friends with my fiancé; do you,
  Leslie?"</p>

  <p>"I had no idea that there was anything between Arthur and you," said
  Leslie truthfully.</p>

  <p>Again Miss Wenner sighed.</p>

  <p>"Very few people knew anything about it. Perhaps it is all for the best.
  Arthur thinks so. It isn't as though I'd thrown myself at him, so there's no
  harm done one way or the other."</p>

  <p>Leslie was wearing a pair of men's slippers when she came down the broad
  stairs. Dick's study door was open, and she saw him sitting in a deep cane
  chair on the lawn outside, a pipe between his teeth, a heap of documents on
  his knees which he was examining slowly one by one. He looked round, rising
  from his chair at the sound of her voice. She saw his face and was
  shocked.</p>

  <p>"Dick, you look a hundred years old!"</p>

  <p>"I feel a thousand," he said, and guided her to the chair. "Sit down.
  Well, that's the end, Leslie&mdash;and the beginning."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think we've managed to keep the ugliest part of it out of the
  newspapers. Poor old Harry!" There were tears in his eyes which he did not
  attempt to hide. "Poor old victim!"</p>

  <p>"Victim of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of his mother," said Dick. "There never was a time when she was sane. My
  poor father did not discover this until after the child was born, and her
  death removed one of the greatest sorrows from his life. The other
  was&mdash;Harry! Well, now you know the secrets of us all, what do you think,
  Leslie?"</p>

  <p>"Who was the Black Abbot?" she asked, and then, to her amazement:</p>

<p>"I was," he replied quietly, and told her all he had told the high official
from Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"The queer thing was that he must have seen the gold before he died. What
  fools we were! The diary told us as plainly as anything could that the old
  Lord Chelford who hid his treasure chose the bed of the river. It was a year
  of drought, the river was quite dry, and probably he found a deep hole in its
  bed, hid the gold and covered it with shingle that would not wash away."</p>

  <p>"You are very rich now, Dick?"</p>

  <p>He nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I suppose I am. There are a few minor trials and troubles for
  us, Leslie dear," he said, "but when those are all over and everything is
  settled we will go abroad for a year and forget all about these ghastly days
  and nights."</p>

  <p>She took his hand between her two palms.</p>
