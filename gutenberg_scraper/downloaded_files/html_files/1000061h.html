  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">The towers of Zenith aspired above the morning mist; austere
  towers of steel and cement and limestone, sturdy as cliffs and delicate as
  silver rods. They were neither citadels nor churches, but frankly and
  beautifully office-buildings.</p>

  <p>The mist took pity on the fretted structures of earlier generations: the
  Post Office with its shingle-tortured mansard, the red brick minarets of
  hulking old houses, factories with stingy and sooted windows, wooden
  tenements colored like mud. The city was full of such grotesqueries, but the
  clean towers were thrusting them from the business center, and on the farther
  hills were shining new houses, homes&mdash;they seemed&mdash;for laughter and
  tranquillity.</p>

  <p>Over a concrete bridge fled a limousine of long sleek hood and noiseless
  engine. These people in evening clothes were returning from an all-night
  rehearsal of a Little Theater play, an artistic adventure considerably
  illuminated by champagne. Below the bridge curved a railroad, a maze of green
  and crimson lights. The New York Flyer boomed past, and twenty lines of
  polished steel leaped into the glare.</p>

  <p>In one of the skyscrapers the wires of the Associated Press were closing
  down. The telegraph operators wearily raised their celluloid eye-shades after
  a night of talking with Paris and Peking. Through the building crawled the
  scrubwomen, yawning, their old shoes slapping. The dawn mist spun away. Cues
  of men with lunch-boxes clumped toward the immensity of new factories, sheets
  of glass and hollow tile, glittering shops where five thousand men worked
  beneath one roof, pouring out the honest wares that would be sold up the
  Euphrates and across the veldt. The whistles rolled out in greeting a chorus
  cheerful as the April dawn; the song of labor in a city built&mdash;it
  seemed&mdash;for giants.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">There was nothing of the giant in the aspect of the man who
  was beginning to awaken on the sleeping-porch of a Dutch Colonial house in
  that residential district of Zenith known as Floral Heights.</p>

  <p>His name was George F. Babbitt. He was forty-six years old now, in April,
  1920, and he made nothing in particular, neither butter nor shoes nor poetry,
  but he was nimble in the calling of selling houses for more than people could
  afford to pay.</p>

  <p>His large head was pink, his brown hair thin and dry. His face was babyish
  in slumber, despite his wrinkles and the red spectacle-dents on the slopes of
  his nose. He was not fat but he was exceedingly well fed; his cheeks were
  pads, and the unroughened hand which lay helpless upon the khaki-colored
  blanket was slightly puffy. He seemed prosperous, extremely married and
  unromantic; and altogether unromantic appeared this sleeping-porch, which
  looked on one sizable elm, two respectable grass-plots, a cement driveway,
  and a corrugated iron garage. Yet Babbitt was again dreaming of the fairy
  child, a dream more romantic than scarlet pagodas by a silver sea.</p>

  <p>For years the fairy child had come to him. Where others saw but Georgie
  Babbitt, she discerned gallant youth. She waited for him, in the darkness
  beyond mysterious groves. When at last he could slip away from the crowded
  house he darted to her. His wife, his clamoring friends, sought to follow,
  but he escaped, the girl fleet beside him, and they crouched together on a
  shadowy hillside. She was so slim, so white, so eager! She cried that he was
  gay and valiant, that she would wait for him, that they would sail&mdash;</p>

  <p>Rumble and bang of the milk-truck.</p>

  <p>Babbitt moaned; turned over; struggled back toward his dream. He could see
  only her face now, beyond misty waters. The furnace-man slammed the basement
  door. A dog barked in the next yard. As Babbitt sank blissfully into a dim
  warm tide, the paper-carrier went by whistling, and the rolled-up
  <i>Advocate</i> thumped the front door. Babbitt roused, his stomach
  constricted with alarm. As he relaxed, he was pierced by the familiar and
  irritating rattle of some one cranking a Ford: snap-ah-ah, snap-ah-ah,
  snap-ah-ah. Himself a pious motorist, Babbitt cranked with the unseen driver,
  with him waited through taut hours for the roar of the starting engine, with
  him agonized as the roar ceased and again began the infernal patient
  snap-ah-ah&mdash;a round, flat sound, a shivering cold-morning sound, a sound
  infuriating and inescapable. Not till the rising voice of the motor told him
  that the Ford was moving was he released from the panting tension. He glanced
  once at his favorite tree, elm twigs against the gold patina of sky, and
  fumbled for sleep as for a drug. He who had been a boy very credulous of life
  was no longer greatly interested in the possible and improbable adventures of
  each new day.</p>

  <p>He escaped from reality till the alarm-clock rang, at seven-twenty.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">It was the best of nationally advertised and quantitatively
  produced alarm-clocks, with all modern attachments, including cathedral
  chime, intermittent alarm, and a phosphorescent dial. Babbitt was proud of
  being awakened by such a rich device. Socially it was almost as creditable as
  buying expensive cord tires.</p>

  <p>He sulkily admitted now that there was no more escape, but he lay and
  detested the grind of the real-estate business, and disliked his family, and
  disliked himself for disliking them. The evening before, he had played poker
  at Vergil Gunch's till midnight, and after such holidays he was irritable
  before breakfast. It may have been the tremendous home-brewed beer of the
  prohibition-era and the cigars to which that beer enticed him; it may have
  been resentment of return from this fine, bold man-world to a restricted
  region of wives and stenographers, and of suggestions not to smoke so
  much.</p>

  <p>From the bedroom beside the sleeping-porch, his wife's detestably cheerful
  "Time to get up, Georgie boy," and the itchy sound, the brisk and scratchy
  sound, of combing hairs out of a stiff brush.</p>

  <p>He grunted; he dragged his thick legs, in faded baby-blue pajamas, from
  under the khaki blanket; he sat on the edge of the cot, running his fingers
  through his wild hair, while his plump feet mechanically felt for his
  slippers. He looked regretfully at the blanket&mdash;forever a suggestion to
  him of freedom and heroism. He had bought it for a camping trip which had
  never come off. It symbolized gorgeous loafing, gorgeous cursing, virile
  flannel shirts.</p>

  <p>He creaked to his feet, groaning at the waves of pain which passed behind
  his eyeballs. Though he waited for their scorching recurrence, he looked
  blurrily out at the yard. It delighted him, as always; it was the neat yard
  of a successful business man of Zenith, that is, it was perfection, and made
  him also perfect. He regarded the corrugated iron garage. For the
  three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth time in a year he reflected, "No class to that
  tin shack. Have to build me a frame garage. But by golly it's the only thing
  on the place that isn't up-to-date!" While he stared he thought of a
  community garage for his acreage development, Glen Oriole. He stopped puffing
  and jiggling. His arms were akimbo. His petulant, sleep-swollen face was set
  in harder lines. He suddenly seemed capable, an official, a man to contrive,
  to direct, to get things done.</p>

  <p>On the vigor of his idea he was carried down the hard, dean,
  unused-looking hall into the bathroom.</p>

  <p>Though the house was not large it had, like all houses on Floral Heights,
  an altogether royal bathroom of porcelain and glazed tile and metal sleek as
  silver. The towel-rack was a rod of clear glass set in nickel. The tub was
  long enough for a Prussian Guard, and above the set bowl was a sensational
  exhibit of tooth-brush holder, shaving-brush holder, soap-dish, sponge-dish,
  and medicine-cabinet, so glittering and so ingenious that they resembled an
  electrical instrument-board. But the Babbitt whose god was Modern Appliances
  was not pleased. The air of the bathroom was thick with the smell of a
  heathen toothpaste. "Verona been at it again! 'Stead of sticking to Lilidol,
  like I've re-peat-ed-ly asked her, she's gone and gotten some confounded
  stinkum stuff that makes you sick!"</p>

  <p>The bath-mat was wrinkled and the floor was wet. (His daughter Verona
  eccentrically took baths in the morning, now and then.) He slipped on the
  mat, and slid against the tub. He said "Damn!" Furiously he snatched up his
  tube of shaving-cream, furiously he lathered, with a belligerent slapping of
  the unctuous brush, furiously he raked his plump cheeks with a safety-razor.
  It pulled. The blade was dull. He said, "Damn&mdash;oh&mdash;oh&mdash;damn
  it!"</p>

  <p>He hunted through the medicine-cabinet for a packet of new razor-blades
  (reflecting, as invariably, "Be cheaper to buy one of these dinguses and
  strop your own blades,") and when he discovered the packet, behind the round
  box of bicarbonate of soda, he thought ill of his wife for putting it there
  and very well of himself for not saying "Damn." But he did say it,
  immediately afterward, when with wet and soap-slippery fingers he tried to
  remove the horrible little envelope and crisp clinging oiled paper from the
  new blade. Then there was the problem, oft-pondered, never solved, of what to
  do with the old blade, which might imperil the fingers of his young. As
  usual, he tossed it on top of the medicine-cabinet, with a mental note that
  some day he must remove the fifty or sixty other blades that were also
  temporarily, piled up there. He finished his shaving in a growing testiness
  increased by his spinning headache and by the emptiness in his stomach. When
  he was done, his round face smooth and streamy and his eyes stinging from
  soapy water, he reached for a towel. The family towels were wet, wet and
  clammy and vile, all of them wet, he found, as he blindly snatched
  them&mdash;his own face-towel, his wife's, Verona's, Ted's, Tinka's, and the
  lone bath-towel with the huge welt of initial. Then George F. Babbitt did a
  dismaying thing. He wiped his face on the guest-towel! It was a
  pansy-embroidered trifle which always hung there to indicate that the
  Babbitts were in the best Floral Heights society. No one had ever used it. No
  guest had ever dared to. Guests secretively took a corner of the nearest
  regular towel.</p>

  <p>He was raging, "By golly, here they go and use up all the towels, every
  doggone one of 'em, and they use 'em and get 'em all wet and sopping, and
  never put out a dry one for me&mdash;of course, I'm the goat!&mdash;and then
  I want one and&mdash;I'm the only person in the doggone house that's got the
  slightest doggone bit of consideration for other people and thoughtfulness
  and consider there may be others that may want to use the doggone bathroom
  after me and consider&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was pitching the chill abominations into the bath-tub, pleased by the
  vindictiveness of that desolate flapping sound; and in the midst his wife
  serenely trotted in, observed serenely, "Why Georgie dear, what are you
  doing? Are you going to wash out the towels? Why, you needn't wash out the
  towels. Oh, Georgie, you didn't go and use the guest-towel, did you?"</p>

  <p>It is not recorded that he was able to answer.</p>

  <p>For the first time in weeks he was sufficiently roused by his wife to look
  at her.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">Myra Babbitt&mdash;Mrs. George F. Babbitt&mdash;was
  definitely mature. She had creases from the corners of her mouth to the
  bottom of her chin, and her plump neck bagged. But the thing that marked her
  as having passed the line was that she no longer had reticences before her
  husband, and no longer worried about not having reticences. She was in a
  petticoat now, and corsets which bulged, and unaware of being seen in bulgy
  corsets. She had become so dully habituated to married life that in her full
  matronliness she was as sexless as an anemic nun. She was a good woman, a
  kind woman, a diligent woman, but no one, save perhaps Tinka her
  ten-year-old, was at all interested in her or entirely aware that she was
  alive.</p>

  <p>After a rather thorough discussion of all the domestic and social aspects
  of towels she apologized to Babbitt for his having an alcoholic headache; and
  he recovered enough to endure the search for a B.V.D. undershirt which had,
  he pointed out, malevolently been concealed among his clean pajamas.</p>

  <p>He was fairly amiable in the conference on the brown suit.</p>

  <p>"What do you think, Myra?" He pawed at the clothes hunched on a chair in
  their bedroom, while she moved about mysteriously adjusting and patting her
  petticoat and, to his jaundiced eye, never seeming to get on with her
  dressing. "How about it? Shall I wear the brown suit another day?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it looks awfully nice on you."</p>

  <p>"I know, but gosh, it needs pressing."</p>

  <p>"That's so. Perhaps it does."</p>

  <p>"It certainly could stand being pressed, all right."</p>

  <p>"Yes, perhaps it wouldn't hurt it to be pressed."</p>

  <p>"But gee, the coat doesn't need pressing. No sense in having the whole
  darn suit pressed, when the coat doesn't need it."</p>

  <p>"That's so."</p>

  <p>"But the pants certainly need it, all right. Look at them&mdash;look at
  those wrinkles&mdash;the pants certainly do need pressing."</p>

  <p>"That's so. Oh, Georgie, why couldn't you wear the brown coat with the
  blue trousers we were wondering what we'd do with them?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! Did you ever in all my life know me to wear the coat of one
  suit and the pants of another? What do you think I am? A busted
  bookkeeper?"</p>

  <p>"Well, why don't you put on the dark gray suit to-day, and stop in at the
  tailor and leave the brown trousers?"</p>

  <p>"Well, they certainly need&mdash;Now where the devil is that gray suit?
  Oh, yes, here we are."</p>

  <p>He was able to get through the other crises of dressing with comparative
  resoluteness and calm.</p>

  <p>His first adornment was the sleeveless dimity B.V.D. undershirt, in which
  he resembled a small boy humorlessly wearing a cheesecloth tabard at a civic
  pageant. He never put on B.V.D.'s without thanking the God of Progress that
  he didn't wear tight, long, old-fashioned undergarments, like his
  father-in-law and partner, Henry Thompson. His second embellishment was
  combing and slicking back his hair. It gave him a tremendous forehead,
  arching up two inches beyond the former hair-line. But most wonder-working of
  all was the donning of his spectacles.</p>

  <p>There is character in spectacles&mdash;the pretentious tortoiseshell, the
  meek pince-nez of the school teacher, the twisted silver-framed glasses of
  the old villager. Babbitt's spectacles had huge, circular, frameless lenses
  of the very best glass; the ear-pieces were thin bars of gold. In them he was
  the modern business man; one who gave orders to clerks and drove a car and
  played occasional golf and was scholarly in regard to Salesmanship. His head
  suddenly appeared not babyish but weighty, and you noted his heavy, blunt
  nose, his straight mouth and thick, long upper lip, his chin over fleshy but
  strong; with respect you beheld him put on the rest of his uniform as a Solid
  Citizen.</p>

  <p>The gray suit was well cut, well made, and completely undistinguished. It
  was a standard suit. White piping on the V of the vest added a flavor of law
  and learning. His shoes were black laced boots, good boots, honest boots,
  standard boots, extraordinarily uninteresting boots. The only frivolity was
  in his purple knitted scarf. With considerable comment on the matter to Mrs.
  Babbitt (who, acrobatically fastening the back of her blouse to her skirt
  with a safety-pin, did not hear a word he said), he chose between the purple
  scarf and a tapestry effect with stringless brown harps among blown palms,
  and into it he thrust a snake-head pin with opal eyes.</p>

  <p>A sensational event was changing from the brown suit to the gray the
  contents of his pockets. He was earnest about these objects. They were of
  eternal importance, like baseball or the Republican Party. They included a
  fountain pen and a silver pencil (always lacking a supply of new leads) which
  belonged in the right hand upper vest pocket. Without them he would have felt
  naked. On his watch-chain were a gold penknife, silver cigar-cutter, seven
  keys (the use of two of which he had forgotten), and incidentally a good
  watch. Depending from the chain was a large, yellowish
  elk's-tooth-proclamation of his membership in the Brotherly and Protective
  Order of Elks. Most significant of all was his loose-leaf pocket note-book,
  that modern and efficient note-book which contained the addresses of people
  whom he had forgotten, prudent memoranda of postal money-orders which had
  reached their destinations months ago, stamps which had lost their mucilage,
  clippings of verses by T. Cholmondeley Frink and of the newspaper editorials
  from which Babbitt got his opinions and his polysyllables, notes to be sure
  and do things which he did not intend to do, and one curious
  inscription&mdash;D.S.S. D.M.Y.P.D.F.</p>

  <p>But he had no cigarette-case. No one had ever happened to give him one, so
  he hadn't the habit, and people who carried cigarette-cases he regarded as
  effeminate.</p>

  <p>Last, he stuck in his lapel the Boosters' Club button. With the
  conciseness of great art the button displayed two words: "Boosters-Pep!" It
  made Babbitt feel loyal and important. It associated him with Good Fellows,
  with men who were nice and human, and important in business circles. It was
  his V.C., his Legion of Honor ribbon, his Phi Beta Kappa key.</p>

  <p>With the subtleties of dressing ran other complex worries. "I feel kind of
  punk this morning," he said. "I think I had too much dinner last evening. You
  oughtn't to serve those heavy banana fritters."</p>

  <p>"But you asked me to have some."</p>

  <p>"I know, but&mdash;I tell you, when a fellow gets past forty he has to
  look after his digestion. There's a lot of fellows that don't take proper
  care of themselves. I tell you at forty a man's a fool or his doctor&mdash;I
  mean, his own doctor. Folks don't give enough attention to this matter of
  dieting. Now I think&mdash;Course a man ought to have a good meal after the
  day's work, but it would be a good thing for both of us if we took lighter
  lunches."</p>

  <p>"But Georgie, here at home I always do have a light lunch."</p>

  <p>"Mean to imply I make a hog of myself, eating down-town? Yes, sure! You'd
  have a swell time if you had to eat the truck that new steward hands out to
  us at the Athletic Club! But I certainly do feel out of sorts, this morning.
  Funny, got a pain down here on the left side&mdash;but no, that wouldn't be
  appendicitis, would it? Last night, when I was driving over to Verg Gunch's,
  I felt a pain in my stomach, too. Right here it was&mdash;kind of a sharp
  shooting pain. I&mdash;Where'd that dime go to? Why don't you serve more
  prunes at breakfast? Of course I eat an apple every evening&mdash;an apple a
  day keeps the doctor away&mdash;but still, you ought to have more prunes, and
  not all these fancy doodads."</p>

  <p>"The last time I had prunes you didn't eat them."</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't feel like eating 'em, I suppose. Matter of fact, I think I
  did eat some of 'em. Anyway&mdash;I tell you it's mighty important to&mdash;I
  was saying to Verg Gunch, just last evening, most people don't take
  sufficient care of their diges&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shall we have the Gunches for our dinner, next week?"</p>

  <p>"Why sure; you bet."</p>

  <p>"Now see here, George: I want you to put on your nice dinner-jacket that
  evening."</p>

  <p>"Rats! The rest of 'em won't want to dress."</p>

  <p>"Of course they will. You remember when you didn't dress for the
  Littlefields' supper-party, and all the rest did, and how embarrassed you
  were."</p>

  <p>"Embarrassed, hell! I wasn't embarrassed. Everybody knows I can put on as
  expensive a Tux. as anybody else, and I should worry if I don't happen to
  have it on sometimes. All a darn nuisance, anyway. All right for a woman,
  that stays around the house all the time, but when a fellow's worked like the
  dickens all day, he doesn't want to go and hustle his head off getting into
  the soup-and-fish for a lot of folks that he's seen in just reg'lar ordinary
  clothes that same day."</p>

  <p>"You know you enjoy being seen in one. The other evening you admitted you
  were glad I'd insisted on your dressing. You said you felt a lot better for
  it. And oh, Georgie, I do wish you wouldn't say 'Tux.' It's
  'dinner-jacket.'"</p>

  <p>"Rats, what's the odds?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's what all the nice folks say. Suppose Lucile McKelvey heard you
  calling it a 'Tux.'"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all right now! Lucile McKelvey can't pull anything on me!
  Her folks are common as mud, even if her husband and her dad are
  millionaires! I suppose you're trying to rub in your exalted social position!
  Well, let me tell you that your revered paternal ancestor, Henry T., doesn't
  even call it a 'Tux.'! He calls it a 'bobtail jacket for a ringtail monkey,'
  and you couldn't get him into one unless you chloroformed him!"</p>

  <p>"Now don't be horrid, George."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't want to be horrid, but Lord! you're getting as fussy as
  Verona. Ever since she got out of college she's been too rambunctious to live
  with&mdash;doesn't know what she wants&mdash;well, I know what she
  wants!&mdash;all she wants is to marry a millionaire, and live in Europe, and
  hold some preacher's hand, and simultaneously at the same time stay right
  here in Zenith and be some blooming kind of a socialist agitator or boss
  charity-worker or some damn thing! Lord, and Ted is just as bad! He wants to
  go to college, and he doesn't want to go to college. Only one of the three
  that knows her own mind is Tinka. Simply can't understand how I ever came to
  have a pair of shills children like Rone and Ted. I may not be any
  Rockefeller or James J. Shakespeare, but I certainly do know my own mind, and
  I do keep right on plugging along in the office and&mdash;Do you know the
  latest? Far as I can figure out, Ted's new bee is he'd like to be a movie
  actor and&mdash;And here I've told him a hundred times, if he'll go to
  college and law-school and make good, I'll set him up in business
  and&mdash;Verona just exactly as bad. Doesn't know what she wants. Well,
  well, come on! Aren't you ready yet? The girl rang the bell three minutes
  ago."</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">Before he followed his wife, Babbitt stood at the
  westernmost window of their room. This residential settlement, Floral
  Heights, was on a rise; and though the center of the city was three miles
  away&mdash;Zenith had between three and four hundred thousand inhabitants
  now&mdash;he could see the top of the Second National Tower, an Indiana
  limestone building of thirty-five stories.</p>

  <p>Its shining walls rose against April sky to a simple cornice like a streak
  of white fire. Integrity was in the tower, and decision. It bore its strength
  lightly as a tall soldier. As Babbitt stared, the nervousness was soothed
  from his face, his slack chin lifted in reverence. All he articulated was
  "That's one lovely sight!" but he was inspired by the rhythm of the city; his
  love of it renewed. He beheld the tower as a temple-spire of the religion of
  business, a faith passionate, exalted, surpassing common men; and as he
  clumped down to breakfast he whistled the ballad "Oh, by gee, by gosh, by
  jingo" as though it were a hymn melancholy and noble.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">Relieved of Babbitt's bumbling and the soft grunts with
  which his wife expressed the sympathy she was too experienced to feel and
  much too experienced not to show, their bedroom settled instantly into
  impersonality.</p>

  <p>It gave on the sleeping-porch. It served both of them as dressing-room,
  and on the coldest nights Babbitt luxuriously gave up the duty of being manly
  and retreated to the bed inside, to curl his toes in the warmth and laugh at
  the January gale.</p>

  <p>The room displayed a modest and pleasant color-scheme, after one of the
  best standard designs of the decorator who "did the interiors" for most of
  the speculative-builders' houses in Zenith. The walls were gray, the woodwork
  white, the rug a serene blue; and very much like mahogany was the
  furniture&mdash;the bureau with its great clear mirror, Mrs. Babbitt's
  dressing-table with toilet-articles of almost solid silver, the plain twin
  beds, between them a small table holding a standard electric bedside lamp, a
  glass for water, and a standard bedside book with colored
  illustrations&mdash;what particular book it was cannot be ascertained, since
  no one had ever opened it. The mattresses were firm but not hard, triumphant
  modern mattresses which had cost a great deal of money; the hot-water
  radiator was of exactly the proper scientific surface for the cubic contents
  of the room. The windows were large and easily opened, with the best catches
  and cords, and Holland roller-shades guaranteed not to crack. It was a
  masterpiece among bedrooms, right out of Cheerful Modern Houses for Medium
  Incomes. Only it had nothing to do with the Babbitts, nor with any one else.
  If people had ever lived and loved here, read thrillers at midnight and lain
  in beautiful indolence on a Sunday morning, there were no signs of it. It had
  the air of being a very good room in a very good hotel. One expected the
  chambermaid to come in and make it ready for people who would stay but one
  night, go without looking back, and never think of it again.</p>

  <p>Every second house in Floral Heights had a bedroom precisely like
  this.</p>

  <p>The Babbitts' house was five years old. It was all as competent and glossy
  as this bedroom. It had the best of taste, the best of inexpensive rugs, a
  simple and laudable architecture, and the latest conveniences. Throughout,
  electricity took the place of candles and slatternly hearth-fires. Along the
  bedroom baseboard were three plugs for electric lamps, concealed by little
  brass doors. In the halls were plugs for the vacuum cleaner, and in the
  living-room plugs for the piano lamp, for the electric fan. The trim
  dining-room (with its admirable oak buffet, its leaded-glass cupboard, its
  creamy plaster walls, its modest scene of a salmon expiring upon a pile of
  oysters) had plugs which supplied the electric percolator and the electric
  toaster.</p>

  <p>In fact there was but one thing wrong with the Babbitt house: It was not a
  home.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Often of a morning Babbitt came bouncing and jesting in to
  breakfast. But things were mysteriously awry to-day. As he pontifically tread
  the upper hall he looked into Verona's bedroom and protested, "What's the use
  of giving the family a high-class house when they don't appreciate it and
  tend to business and get down to brass tacks?"</p>

  <p>He marched upon them: Verona, a dumpy brown-haired girl of twenty-two,
  just out of Bryn Mawr, given to solicitudes about duty and sex and God and
  the unconquerable bagginess of the gray sports-suit she was now wearing.
  Ted&mdash;Theodore Roosevelt Babbitt&mdash;a decorative boy of seventeen.
  Tinka&mdash;Katherine&mdash;still a baby at ten, with radiant red hair and a
  thin skin which hinted of too much candy and too many ice cream sodas.
  Babbitt did not show his vague irritation as he tramped in. He really
  disliked being a family tyrant, and his nagging was as meaningless as it was
  frequent. He shouted at Tinka, "Well, kittiedoolie!" It was the only pet name
  in his vocabulary, except the "dear" and "hon." with which he recognized his
  wife, and he flung it at Tinka every morning.</p>

  <p>He gulped a cup of coffee in the hope of pacifying his stomach and his
  soul. His stomach ceased to feel as though it did not belong to him, but
  Verona began to be conscientious and annoying, and abruptly there returned to
  Babbitt the doubts regarding life and families and business which had clawed
  at him when his dream-life and the slim fairy girl had fled.</p>

  <p>Verona had for six months been filing-clerk at the Gruensberg Leather
  Company offices, with a prospect of becoming secretary to Mr. Gruensberg and
  thus, as Babbitt defined it, "getting some good out of your expensive college
  education till you're ready to marry and settle down."</p>

  <p>But now said Verona: "Father! I was talking to a classmate of mine that's
  working for the Associated Charities&mdash;oh, Dad, there's the sweetest
  little babies that come to the milk-station there!&mdash;and I feel as though
  I ought to be doing something worth while like that."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean 'worth while'? If you get to be Gruensberg's
  secretary&mdash;and maybe you would, if you kept up your shorthand and didn't
  go sneaking off to concerts and talkfests every evening&mdash;I guess you'll
  find thirty-five or forty bones a week worth while!"</p>

  <p>"I know, but&mdash;oh, I want to&mdash;contribute&mdash;I wish I were
  working in a settlement-house. I wonder if I could get one of the
  department-stores to let me put in a welfare-department with a nice rest-room
  and chintzes and wicker chairs and so on and so forth. Or I could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now you look here! The first thing you got to understand is that all this
  uplift and flipflop and settlement-work and recreation is nothing in God's
  world but the entering wedge for socialism. The sooner a man learns he isn't
  going to be coddled, and he needn't expect a lot of free grub and, uh, all
  these free classes and flipflop and doodads for his kids unless he earns 'em,
  why, the sooner he'll get on the job and produce&mdash;produce&mdash;produce!
  That's what the country needs, and not all this fancy stuff that just
  enfeebles the will-power of the working man and gives his kids a lot of
  notions above their class. And you&mdash;if you'd tend to business instead of
  fooling and fussing&mdash;All the time! When I was a young man I made up my
  mind what I wanted to do, and stuck to it through thick and thin, and that's
  why I'm where I am to-day, and&mdash;Myra! What do you let the girl chop the
  toast up into these dinky little chunks for? Can't get your fist onto 'em.
  Half cold, anyway!"</p>

  <p>Ted Babbitt, junior in the great East Side High School, had been making
  hiccup-like sounds of interruption. He blurted now, "Say, Rone, you going
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Verona whirled. "Ted! Will you kindly not interrupt us when we're talking
  about serious matters!"</p>

  <p>"Aw punk," said Ted judicially. "Ever since somebody slipped up and let
  you out of college, Ammonia, you been pulling these nut conversations about
  what-nots and so-on-and-so-forths. Are you going to&mdash;I want to use the
  car tonight."</p>

  <p>Babbitt snorted, "Oh, you do! May want it myself!" Verona protested, "Oh,
  you do, Mr. Smarty! I'm going to take it myself!" Tinka wailed, "Oh, papa,
  you said maybe you'd drive us down to Rosedale!" and Mrs. Babbitt, "Careful,
  Tinka, your sleeve is in the butter." They glared, and Verona hurled, "Ted,
  you're a perfect pig about the car!"</p>

  <p>"Course you're not! Not a-tall!" Ted could be maddeningly bland. "You just
  want to grab it off, right after dinner, and leave it in front of some
  skirt's house all evening while you sit and gas about lite'ature and the
  highbrows you're going to marry&mdash;if they only propose!"</p>

  <p>"Well, Dad oughtn't to <i>ever</i> let you have it! You and those beastly
  Jones boys drive like maniacs. The idea of your taking the turn on Chautauqua
  Place at forty miles an hour!"</p>

  <p>"Aw, where do you get that stuff! You're so darn scared of the car that
  you drive up-hill with the emergency brake on!"</p>

  <p>"I do not! And you&mdash;Always talking about how much you know about
  motors, and Eunice Littlefield told me you said the battery fed the
  generator!"</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;why, my good woman, you don't know a generator from a
  differential." Not unreasonably was Ted lofty with her. He was a natural
  mechanic, a maker and tinkerer of machines; he lisped in blueprints for the
  blueprints came.</p>

  <p>"That'll do now!" Babbitt flung in mechanically, as he lighted the
  gloriously satisfying first cigar of the day and tasted the exhilarating drug
  of the <i>Advocate-Times</i> headlines.</p>

  <p>Ted negotiated: "Gee, honest, Rone, I don't want to take the old boat, but
  I promised couple o' girls in my class I'd drive 'em down to the rehearsal of
  the school chorus, and, gee, I don't want to, but a gentleman's got to keep
  his social engagements."</p>

  <p>"Well, upon my word! You and your social engagements! In high school!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, ain't we select since we went to that hen college! Let me tell you
  there isn't a private school in the state that's got as swell a bunch as we
  got in Gamma Digamma this year. There's two fellows that their dads are
  millionaires. Say, gee, I ought to have a car of my own, like lots of the
  fellows." Babbitt almost rose. "A car of your own! Don't you want a yacht,
  and a house and lot? That pretty nearly takes the cake! A boy that can't pass
  his Latin examinations, like any other boy ought to, and he expects me to
  give him a motor-car, and I suppose a chauffeur, and an aeroplane maybe, as a
  reward for the hard work he puts in going to the movies with Eunice
  Littlefield! Well, when you see me giving you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Somewhat later, after diplomacies, Ted persuaded Verona to admit that she
  was merely going to the Armory, that evening, to see the dog and cat show.
  She was then, Ted planned, to park the car in front of the candy-store across
  from the Armory and he would pick it up. There were masterly arrangements
  regarding leaving the key, and having the gasoline tank filled; and
  passionately, devotees of the Great God Motor, they hymned the patch on the
  spare inner-tube, and the lost jack-handle.</p>

  <p>Their truce dissolving, Ted observed that her friends were "a scream of a
  bunch-stuck-up gabby four-flushers." His friends, she indicated, were
  "disgusting imitation sports, and horrid little shrieking ignorant girls."
  Further: "It's disgusting of you to smoke cigarettes, and so on and so forth,
  and those clothes you've got on this morning, they're too utterly
  ridiculous&mdash;honestly, simply disgusting."</p>

  <p>Ted balanced over to the low beveled mirror in the buffet, regarded his
  charms, and smirked. His suit, the latest thing in Old Eli Togs, was
  skin-tight, with skimpy trousers to the tops of his glaring tan boots, a
  chorus-man waistline, pattern of an agitated check, and across the back a
  belt which belted nothing. His scarf was an enormous black silk wad. His
  flaxen hair was ice-smooth, pasted back without parting. When he went to
  school he would add a cap with a long vizor like a shovel-blade. Proudest of
  all was his waistcoat, saved for, begged for, plotted for; a real Fancy Vest
  of fawn with polka dots of a decayed red, the points astoundingly long. On
  the lower edge of it he wore a high-school button, a class button, and a
  fraternity pin.</p>

  <p>And none of it mattered. He was supple and swift and flushed; his eyes
  (which he believed to be cynical) were candidly eager. But he was not
  over-gentle. He waved his hand at poor dumpy Verona and drawled: "Yes, I
  guess we're pretty ridiculous and disgusticulus, and I rather guess our new
  necktie is some smear!"</p>

  <p>Babbitt barked: "It is! And while you're admiring yourself, let me tell
  you it might add to your manly beauty if you wiped some of that egg off your
  mouth!"</p>

  <p>Verona giggled, momentary victor in the greatest of Great Wars, which is
  the family war. Ted looked at her hopelessly, then shrieked at Tinka: "For
  the love o' Pete, quit pouring the whole sugar bowl on your corn flakes!"</p>

  <p>When Verona and Ted were gone and Tinka upstairs, Babbitt groaned to his
  wife: "Nice family, I must say! I don't pretend to be any baa-lamb, and maybe
  I'm a little cross-grained at breakfast sometimes, but the way they go on
  jab-jab-jabbering, I simply can't stand it. I swear, I feel like going off
  some place where I can get a little peace. I do think after a man's spent his
  lifetime trying to give his kids a chance and a decent education, it's pretty
  discouraging to hear them all the time scrapping like a bunch of hyenas and
  never&mdash;and never&mdash;Curious; here in the paper it says&mdash;Never
  silent for one mom&mdash;Seen the morning paper yet?"</p>

  <p>"No, dear." In twenty-three years of married life, Mrs. Babbitt had seen
  the paper before her husband just sixty-seven times.</p>

  <p>"Lots of news. Terrible big tornado in the South. Hard luck, all right.
  But this, say, this is corking! Beginning of the end for those fellows! New
  York Assembly has passed some bills that ought to completely outlaw the
  socialists! And there's an elevator-runners' strike in New York and a lot of
  college boys are taking their places. That's the stuff! And a mass-meeting in
  Birmingham's demanded that this Mick agitator, this fellow De Valera, be
  deported. Dead right, by golly! All these agitators paid with German gold
  anyway. And we got no business interfering with the Irish or any other
  foreign government. Keep our hands strictly off. And there's another
  well-authenticated rumor from Russia that Lenin is dead. That's fine. It's
  beyond me why we don't just step in there and kick those Bolshevik cusses
  out."</p>

  <p>"That's so," said Mrs. Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"And it says here a fellow was inaugurated mayor in overalls&mdash;a
  preacher, too! What do you think of that!"</p>

  <p>"Humph! Well!"</p>

  <p>He searched for an attitude, but neither as a Republican, a Presbyterian,
  an Elk, nor a real-estate broker did he have any doctrine about
  preacher-mayors laid down for him, so he grunted and went on. She looked
  sympathetic and did not hear a word. Later she would read the headlines, the
  society columns, and the department-store advertisements.</p>

  <p>"What do you know about this! Charley McKelvey still doing the sassiety
  stunt as heavy as ever. Here's what that gushy woman reporter says about last
  night:"</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Never is Society with the big, big S more flattered than
  when they are bidden to partake of good cheer at the distinguished and
  hospitable residence of Mr. and Mrs. Charles L. McKelvey as they were last
  night. Set in its spacious lawns and landscaping, one of the notable sights
  crowning Royal Ridge, but merry and homelike despite its mighty stone walls
  and its vast rooms famed for their decoration, their home was thrown open
  last night for a dance in honor of Mrs. McKelvey's notable guest, Miss J.
  Sneeth of Washington. The wide hall is so generous in its proportions that it
  made a perfect ballroom, its hardwood floor reflecting the charming pageant
  above its polished surface. Even the delights of dancing paled before the
  alluring opportunities for tete-a-tetes that invited the soul to loaf in the
  long library before the baronial fireplace, or in the drawing-room with its
  deep comfy armchairs, its shaded lamps just made for a sly whisper of pretty
  nothings all a <i>deux</i>; or even in the billiard room where one could take
  a cue and show a prowess at still another game than that sponsored by Cupid
  and Terpsichore.</p><br>

  <p>There was more, a great deal more, in the best urban journalistic style of
  Miss Elnora Pearl Bates, the popular society editor of the
  <i>Advocate-Times</i>. But Babbitt could not abide it. He grunted. He
  wrinkled the newspaper. He protested: "Can you beat it! I'm willing to hand a
  lot of credit to Charley McKelvey. When we were in college together, he was
  just as hard up as any of us, and he's made a million good bucks out of
  contracting and hasn't been any dishonester or bought any more city councils
  than was necessary. And that's a good house of his&mdash;though it ain't any
  'mighty stone walls' and it ain't worth the ninety thousand it cost him. But
  when it comes to talking as though Charley McKelvey and all that
  booze-hoisting set of his are any blooming bunch of of, of Vanderbilts, why,
  it makes me tired!"</p>

  <p>Timidly from Mrs. Babbitt: "I would like to see the inside of their house
  though. It must be lovely. I've never been inside."</p>

  <p>"Well, I have! Lots of&mdash;couple of times. To see Chaz about business
  deals, in the evening. It's not so much. I wouldn't <i>want</i> to go there
  to dinner with that gang of, of high-binders. And I'll bet I make a whole lot
  more money than some of those tin-horns that spend all they got on
  dress-suits and haven't got a decent suit of underwear to their name! Hey!
  What do you think of this!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Babbitt was strangely unmoved by the tidings from the Real Estate and
  Building column of the <i>Advocate-Times:</i></p><br>

  <p class="cp">Ashtabula Street, 496&mdash;J. K. Dawson to<br>
  Thomas Mullally, April 17, 15.7 X 112.2,<br>
  mtg. $4000..........Nom</p><br>

  <p>And this morning Babbitt was too disquieted to entertain her with items
  from Mechanics' Liens, Mortgages Recorded, and Contracts Awarded. He rose. As
  he looked at her his eyebrows seemed shaggier than usual. Suddenly:</p>

  <p>"Yes, maybe&mdash;Kind of shame to not keep in touch with folks like the
  McKelveys. We might try inviting them to dinner, some evening. Oh, thunder,
  let's not waste our good time thinking about 'em! Our little bunch has a lot
  liver times than all those plutes. Just compare a real human like you with
  these neurotic birds like Lucile McKelvey&mdash;all highbrow talk and dressed
  up like a plush horse! You're a great old girl, hon.!"</p>

  <p>He covered his betrayal of softness with a complaining: "Say, don't let
  Tinka go and eat any more of that poison nut fudge. For Heaven's sake, try to
  keep her from ruining her digestion. I tell you, most folks don't appreciate
  how important it is to have a good digestion and regular habits. Be back
  'bout usual time, I guess."</p>

  <p>He kissed her&mdash;he didn't quite kiss her&mdash;he laid unmoving lips
  against her unflushing cheek. He hurried out to the garage, muttering: "Lord,
  what a family! And now Myra is going to get pathetic on me because we don't
  train with this millionaire outfit. Oh, Lord, sometimes I'd like to quit the
  whole game. And the office worry and detail just as bad. And I act cranky
  and&mdash;I don't mean to, but I get&mdash;So darn tired!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">To George F. Babbitt, as to most prosperous citizens of
  Zenith, his motor car was poetry and tragedy, love and heroism. The office
  was his pirate ship but the car his perilous excursion ashore.</p>

  <p>Among the tremendous crises of each day none was more dramatic than
  starting the engine. It was slow on cold mornings; there was the long,
  anxious whirr of the starter; and sometimes he had to drip ether into the
  cocks of the cylinders, which was so very interesting that at lunch he would
  chronicle it drop by drop, and orally calculate how much each drop had cost
  him.</p>

  <p>This morning he was darkly prepared to find something wrong, and he felt
  belittled when the mixture exploded sweet and strong, and the car didn't even
  brush the door-jamb, gouged and splintery with many bruisings by fenders, as
  he backed out of the garage. He was confused. He shouted "Morning!" to Sam
  Doppelbrau with more cordiality than he had intended.</p>

  <p>Babbitt's green and white Dutch Colonial house was one of three in that
  block on Chatham Road. To the left of it was the residence of Mr. Samuel
  Doppelbrau, secretary of an excellent firm of bathroom-fixture jobbers. His
  was a comfortable house with no architectural manners whatever; a large
  wooden box with a squat tower, a broad porch, and glossy paint yellow as a
  yolk. Babbitt disapproved of Mr. and Mrs. Doppelbrau as "Bohemian." From
  their house came midnight music and obscene laughter; there were neighborhood
  rumors of bootlegged whisky and fast motor rides. They furnished Babbitt with
  many happy evenings of discussion, during which he announced firmly, "I'm not
  strait-laced, and I don't mind seeing a fellow throw in a drink once in a
  while, but when it comes to deliberately trying to get away with a lot of
  hell-raising all the while like the Doppelbraus do, it's too rich for my
  blood!"</p>

  <p>On the other side of Babbitt lived Howard Littlefield, Ph.D., in a
  strictly modern house whereof the lower part was dark red tapestry brick,
  with a leaded oriel, the upper part of pale stucco like spattered clay, and
  the roof red-tiled. Littlefield was the Great Scholar of the neighborhood;
  the authority on everything in the world except babies, cooking, and motors.
  He was a Bachelor of Arts of Blodgett College, and a Doctor of Philosophy in
  economics of Yale. He was the employment-manager and publicity-counsel of the
  Zenith Street Traction Company. He could, on ten hours' notice, appear before
  the board of aldermen or the state legislature and prove, absolutely, with
  figures all in rows and with precedents from Poland and New Zealand, that the
  street-car company loved the Public and yearned over its employees; that all
  its stock was owned by Widows and Orphans; and that whatever it desired to do
  would benefit property-owners by increasing rental values, and help the poor
  by lowering rents. All his acquaintances turned to Littlefield when they
  desired to know the date of the battle of Saragossa, the definition of the
  word "sabotage," the future of the German mark, the translation of "<i>hinc
  illae lachrimae</i>," or the number of products of coal tar. He awed Babbitt
  by confessing that he often sat up till midnight reading the figures and
  footnotes in Government reports, or skimming (with amusement at the author's
  mistakes) the latest volumes of chemistry, archeology, and ichthyology.</p>

  <p>But Littlefield's great value was as a spiritual example. Despite his
  strange learnings he was as strict a Presbyterian and as firm a Republican as
  George F. Babbitt. He confirmed the business men in the faith. Where they
  knew only by passionate instinct that their system of industry and manners
  was perfect, Dr. Howard Littlefield proved it to them, out of history,
  economics, and the confessions of reformed radicals.</p>

  <p>Babbitt had a good deal of honest pride in being the neighbor of such a
  savant, and in Ted's intimacy with Eunice Littlefield. At sixteen Eunice was
  interested in no statistics save those regarding the ages and salaries of
  motion-picture stars, but&mdash;as Babbitt definitively put it&mdash;"she was
  her father's daughter."</p>

  <p>The difference between a light man like Sam Doppelbrau and a really fine
  character like Littlefield was revealed in their appearances. Doppelbrau was
  disturbingly young for a man of forty-eight. He wore his derby on the back of
  his head, and his red face was wrinkled with meaningless laughter. But
  Littlefield was old for a man of forty-two. He was tall, broad, thick; his
  gold-rimmed spectacles were engulfed in the folds of his long face; his hair
  was a tossed mass of greasy blackness; he puffed and rumbled as he talked;
  his Phi Beta Kappa key shone against a spotty black vest; he smelled of old
  pipes; he was altogether funereal and archidiaconal; and to real-estate
  brokerage and the jobbing of bathroom-fixtures he added an aroma of
  sanctity.</p>

  <p>This morning he was in front of his house, inspecting the grass parking
  between the curb and the broad cement sidewalk. Babbitt stopped his car and
  leaned out to shout "Mornin'!" Littlefield lumbered over and stood with one
  foot up on the running-board.</p>

  <p>"Fine morning," said Babbitt, lighting&mdash;illegally early&mdash;his
  second cigar of the day.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's a mighty fine morning," said Littlefield.</p>

  <p>"Spring coming along fast now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's real spring now, all right," said Littlefield.</p>

  <p>"Still cold nights, though. Had to have a couple blankets, on the
  sleeping-porch last night."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it wasn't any too warm last night," said Littlefield.</p>

  <p>"But I don't anticipate we'll have any more real cold weather now."</p>

  <p>"No, but still, there was snow at Tiflis, Montana, yesterday," said the
  Scholar, "and you remember the blizzard they had out West three days
  ago&mdash;thirty inches of snow at Greeley, Colorado&mdash;and two years ago
  we had a snow-squall right here in Zenith on the twenty-fifth of April."</p>

  <p>"Is that a fact! Say, old man, what do you think about the Republican
  candidate? Who'll they nominate for president? Don't you think it's about
  time we had a real business administration?"</p>

  <p>"In my opinion, what the country needs, first and foremost, is a good,
  sound, business-like conduct of its affairs. What we need is&mdash;a business
  administration!" said Littlefield.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to hear you say that! I certainly am glad to hear you say that!
  I didn't know how you'd feel about it, with all your associations with
  colleges and so on, and I'm glad you feel that way. What the country
  needs&mdash;just at this present juncture&mdash;is neither a college
  president nor a lot of monkeying with foreign affairs, but a good&mdash;sound
  economical&mdash;business&mdash;administration, that will give us a chance to
  have something like a decent turnover."</p>

  <p>"Yes. It isn't generally realized that even in China the schoolmen are
  giving way to more practical men, and of course you can see what that
  implies."</p>

  <p>"Is that a fact! Well, well!" breathed Babbitt, feeling much calmer, and
  much happier about the way things were going in the world. "Well, it's been
  nice to stop and parleyvoo a second. Guess I'll have to get down to the
  office now and sting a few clients. Well, so long, old man. See you tonight.
  So long."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">They had labored, these solid citizens. Twenty years before,
  the hill on which Floral Heights was spread, with its bright roofs and
  immaculate turf and amazing comfort, had been a wilderness of rank
  second-growth elms and oaks and maples. Along the precise streets were still
  a few wooded vacant lots, and the fragment of an old orchard. It was
  brilliant to-day; the apple boughs were lit with fresh leaves like torches of
  green fire. The first white of cherry blossoms flickered down a gully, and
  robins clamored.</p>

  <p>Babbitt sniffed the earth, chuckled at the hysteric robins as he would
  have chuckled at kittens or at a comic movie. He was, to the eye, the perfect
  office-going executive&mdash;a well-fed man in a correct brown soft hat and
  frameless spectacles, smoking a large cigar, driving a good motor along a
  semi-suburban parkway. But in him was some genius of authentic love for his
  neighborhood, his city, his clan. The winter was over; the time was come for
  the building, the visible growth, which to him was glory. He lost his dawn
  depression; he was ruddily cheerful when he stopped on Smith Street to leave
  the brown trousers, and to have the gasoline-tank filled.</p>

  <p>The familiarity of the rite fortified him: the sight of the tall red iron
  gasoline-pump, the hollow-tile and terra-cotta garage, the window full of the
  most agreeable accessories&mdash;shiny casings, spark-plugs with immaculate
  porcelain jackets tire-chains of gold and silver. He was flattered by the
  friendliness with which Sylvester Moon, dirtiest and most skilled of motor
  mechanics, came out to serve him. "Mornin', Mr. Babbitt!" said Moon, and
  Babbitt felt himself a person of importance, one whose name even busy
  garagemen remembered&mdash;not one of these cheap-sports flying around in
  flivvers. He admired the ingenuity of the automatic dial, clicking off gallon
  by gallon; admired the smartness of the sign: "A fill in time saves getting
  stuck&mdash;gas to-day 31 cents"; admired the rhythmic gurgle of the gasoline
  as it flowed into the tank, and the mechanical regularity with which Moon
  turned the handle.</p>

  <p>"How much we takin' to-day?" asked Moon, in a manner which combined the
  independence of the great specialist, the friendliness of a familiar gossip,
  and respect for a man of weight in the community, like George F. Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"Fill 'er up."</p>

  <p>"Who you rootin' for for Republican candidate, Mr. Babbitt?"</p>

  <p>"It's too early to make any predictions yet. After all, there's still a
  good month and two weeks&mdash;no, three weeks&mdash;must be almost three
  weeks&mdash;well, there's more than six weeks in all before the Republican
  convention, and I feel a fellow ought to keep an open mind and give all the
  candidates a show&mdash;look 'em all over and size 'em up, and then decide
  carefully."</p>

  <p>"That's a fact, Mr. Babbitt."</p>

  <p>"But I'll tell you&mdash;and my stand on this is just the same as it was
  four years ago, and eight years ago, and it'll be my stand four years from
  now&mdash;yes, and eight years from now! What I tell everybody, and it can't
  be too generally understood, is that what we need first, last, and all the
  time is a good, sound business administration!"</p>

  <p>"By golly, that's right!"</p>

  <p>"How do those front tires look to you?"</p>

  <p>"Fine! Fine! Wouldn't be much work for garages if everybody looked after
  their car the way you do."</p>

  <p>"Well, I do try and have some sense about it." Babbitt paid his bill, said
  adequately, "Oh, keep the change," and drove off in an ecstasy of honest
  self-appreciation. It was with the manner of a Good Samaritan that he shouted
  at a respectable-looking man who was waiting for a trolley car, "Have a
  lift?" As the man climbed in Babbitt condescended, "Going clear down-town?
  Whenever I see a fellow waiting for a trolley, I always make it a practice to
  give him a lift&mdash;unless, of course, he looks like a bum."</p>

  <p>"Wish there were more folks that were so generous with their machines,"
  dutifully said the victim of benevolence. "Oh, no, 'tain't a question of
  generosity, hardly. Fact, I always feel&mdash;I was saying to my son just the
  other night&mdash;it's a fellow's duty to share the good things of this world
  with his neighbors, and it gets my goat when a fellow gets stuck on himself
  and goes around tooting his horn merely because he's charitable."</p>

  <p>The victim seemed unable to find the right answer. Babbitt boomed on:</p>

  <p>"Pretty punk service the Company giving us on these car-lines. Nonsense to
  only run the Portland Road cars once every seven minutes. Fellow gets mighty
  cold on a winter morning, waiting on a street corner with the wind nipping at
  his ankles."</p>

  <p>"That's right. The Street Car Company don't care a damn what kind of a
  deal they give us. Something ought to happen to 'em."</p>

  <p>Babbitt was alarmed. "But still, of course it won't do to just keep
  knocking the Traction Company and not realize the difficulties they're
  operating under, like these cranks that want municipal ownership. The way
  these workmen hold up the Company for high wages is simply a crime, and of
  course the burden falls on you and me that have to pay a seven-cent fare!
  Fact, there's remarkable service on all their lines&mdash;considering."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;" uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Darn fine morning," Babbitt explained. "Spring coming along fast."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's real spring now."</p>

  <p>The victim had no originality, no wit, and Babbitt fell into a great
  silence and devoted himself to the game of beating trolley cars to the
  corner: a spurt, a tail-chase, nervous speeding between the huge yellow side
  of the trolley and the jagged row of parked motors, shooting past just as the
  trolley stopped&mdash;a rare game and valiant.</p>

  <p>And all the while he was conscious of the loveliness of Zenith. For weeks
  together he noticed nothing but clients and the vexing To Rent signs of rival
  brokers. To-day, in mysterious malaise, he raged or rejoiced with equal
  nervous swiftness, and to-day the light of spring was so winsome that he
  lifted his head and saw.</p>

  <p>He admired each district along his familiar route to the office: The
  bungalows and shrubs and winding irregular drive ways of Floral Heights. The
  one-story shops on Smith Street, a glare of plate-glass and new yellow brick;
  groceries and laundries and drug-stores to supply the more immediate needs of
  East Side housewives. The market gardens in Dutch Hollow, their shanties
  patched with corrugated iron and stolen doors. Billboards with crimson
  goddesses nine feet tall advertising cinema films, pipe tobacco, and talcum
  powder. The old "mansions" along Ninth Street, S. E., like aged dandies in
  filthy linen; wooden castles turned into boarding-houses, with muddy walks
  and rusty hedges, jostled by fast-intruding garages, cheap apartment-houses,
  and fruit-stands conducted by bland, sleek Athenians. Across the belt of
  railroad-tracks, factories with high-perched water-tanks and tall
  stacks-factories producing condensed milk, paper boxes, lighting-fixtures,
  motor cars. Then the business center, the thickening darting traffic, the
  crammed trolleys unloading, and high doorways of marble and polished
  granite.</p>

  <p>It was big&mdash;and Babbitt respected bigness in anything; in mountains,
  jewels, muscles, wealth, or words. He was, for a spring-enchanted moment, the
  lyric and almost unselfish lover of Zenith. He thought of the outlying
  factory suburbs; of the Chaloosa River with its strangely eroded banks; of
  the orchard-dappled Tonawanda Hills to the North, and all the fat dairy land
  and big barns and comfortable herds. As he dropped his passenger he cried,
  "Gosh, I feel pretty good this morning!"</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Epochal as starting the car was the drama of parking it
  before he entered his office. As he turned from Oberlin Avenue round the
  corner into Third Street, N.E., he peered ahead for a space in the line of
  parked cars. He angrily just missed a space as a rival driver slid into it.
  Ahead, another car was leaving the curb, and Babbitt slowed up, holding out
  his hand to the cars pressing on him from behind, agitatedly motioning an old
  woman to go ahead, avoiding a truck which bore down on him from one side.
  With front wheels nicking the wrought-steel bumper of the car in front, he
  stopped, feverishly cramped his steering-wheel, slid back into the vacant
  space and, with eighteen inches of room, manoeuvred to bring the car level
  with the curb. It was a virile adventure masterfully executed. With
  satisfaction he locked a thief-proof steel wedge on the front wheel, and
  crossed the street to his real-estate office on the ground floor of the
  Reeves Building.</p>

  <p>The Reeves Building was as fireproof as a rock and as efficient as a
  typewriter; fourteen stories of yellow pressed brick, with clean, upright,
  unornamented lines. It was filled with the offices of lawyers, doctors,
  agents for machinery, for emery wheels, for wire fencing, for mining-stock.
  Their gold signs shone on the windows. The entrance was too modern to be
  flamboyant with pillars; it was quiet, shrewd, neat. Along the Third Street
  side were a Western Union Telegraph Office, the Blue Delft Candy Shop,
  Shotwell's Stationery Shop, and the Babbitt-Thompson Realty Company.</p>

  <p>Babbitt could have entered his office from the street, as customers did,
  but it made him feel an insider to go through the corridor of the building
  and enter by the back door. Thus he was greeted by the villagers.</p>

  <p>The little unknown people who inhabited the Reeves Building
  corridors&mdash;elevator-runners, starter, engineers, superintendent, and the
  doubtful-looking lame man who conducted the news and cigar stand&mdash;were
  in no way city-dwellers. They were rustics, living in a constricted valley,
  interested only in one another and in The Building. Their Main Street was the
  entrance hall, with its stone floor, severe marble ceiling, and the inner
  windows of the shops. The liveliest place on the street was the Reeves
  Building Barber Shop, but this was also Babbitt's one embarrassment. Himself,
  he patronized the glittering Pompeian Barber Shop in the Hotel Thornleigh,
  and every time he passed the Reeves shop&mdash;ten times a day, a hundred
  times&mdash;he felt untrue to his own village.</p>

  <p>Now, as one of the squirearchy, greeted with honorable salutations by the
  villagers, he marched into his office, and peace and dignity were upon him,
  and the morning's dissonances all unheard.</p>

  <p>They were heard again, immediately.</p>

  <p>Stanley Graff, the outside salesman, was talking on the telephone with
  tragic lack of that firm manner which disciplines clients: "Say, uh, I think
  I got just the house that would suit you&mdash;the Percival House, in
  Linton...Oh, you've seen it. Well, how'd it strike you?...Huh?...Oh,"
  irresolutely, "oh, I see."</p>

  <p>As Babbitt marched into his private room, a coop with semi-partition of
  oak and frosted glass, at the back of the office, he reflected how hard it
  was to find employees who had his own faith that he was going to make
  sales.</p>

  <p>There were nine members of the staff, besides Babbitt and his partner and
  father-in-law, Henry Thompson, who rarely came to the office. The nine were
  Stanley Graff, the outside salesman&mdash;a youngish man given to cigarettes
  and the playing of pool; old Mat Penniman, general utility man, collector of
  rents and salesman of insurance&mdash;broken, silent, gray; a mystery,
  reputed to have been a "crack" real-estate man with a firm of his own in
  haughty Brooklyn; Chester Kirby Laylock, resident salesman out at the Glen
  Oriole acreage development&mdash;an enthusiastic person with a silky mustache
  and much family; Miss Theresa McGoun, the swift and rather pretty
  stenographer; Miss Wilberta Bannigan, the thick, slow, laborious accountant
  and file-clerk; and four freelance part-time commission salesmen.</p>

  <p>As he looked from his own cage into the main room Babbitt mourned,
  "McGoun's a good stenog., smart's a whip, but Stan Graff and all those
  bums&mdash;" The zest of the spring morning was smothered in the stale office
  air.</p>

  <p>Normally he admired the office, with a pleased surprise that he should
  have created this sure lovely thing; normally he was stimulated by the clean
  newness of it and the air of bustle; but to-day it seemed flat&mdash;the
  tiled floor, like a bathroom, the ocher-colored metal ceiling, the faded maps
  on the hard plaster walls, the chairs of varnished pale oak, the desks and
  filing-cabinets of steel painted in olive drab. It was a vault, a steel
  chapel where loafing and laughter were raw sin.</p>

  <p>He hadn't even any satisfaction in the new water-cooler! And it was the
  very best of water-coolers, up-to-date, scientific, and right-thinking. It
  had cost a great deal of money (in itself a virtue). It possessed a
  non-conducting fiber ice-container, a porcelain water-jar (guaranteed
  hygienic), a drip-less non-clogging sanitary faucet, and machine-painted
  decorations in two tones of gold. He looked down the relentless stretch of
  tiled floor at the water-cooler, and assured himself that no tenant of the
  Reeves Building had a more expensive one, but he could not recapture the
  feeling of social superiority it had given him. He astoundingly grunted, "I'd
  like to beat it off to the woods right now. And loaf all day. And go to
  Gunch's again to-night, and play poker, and cuss as much as I feel like, and
  drink a hundred and nine-thousand bottles of beer."</p>

  <p>He sighed; he read through his mail; he shouted "Msgoun," which meant
  "Miss McGoun"; and began to dictate.</p>

  <p>This was his own version of his first letter:</p>

  <p>"Omar Gribble, send it to his office, Miss McGoun, yours of twentieth to
  hand and in reply would say look here, Gribble, I'm awfully afraid if we go
  on shilly-shallying like this we'll just naturally lose the Allen sale, I had
  Allen up on carpet day before yesterday and got right down to cases and think
  I can assure you&mdash;uh, uh, no, change that: all my experience indicates
  he is all right, means to do business, looked into his financial record which
  is fine&mdash;that sentence seems to be a little balled up, Miss McGoun; make
  a couple sentences out of it if you have to, period, new paragraph.</p>

  <p>"He is perfectly willing to pro rate the special assessment and strikes
  me, am dead sure there will be no difficulty in getting him to pay for title
  insurance, so now for heaven's sake let's get busy&mdash;no, make that: so
  now let's go to it and get down&mdash;no, that's enough&mdash;you can tie
  those sentences up a little better when you type 'em, Miss McGoun&mdash;your
  sincerely, etcetera."</p>

  <p>This is the version of his letter which he received, typed, from Miss
  McGoun that afternoon:</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">BABBITT-THOMPSON REALTY CO.<br>
  Homes for Folks<br>
  Reeves Bldg., Oberlin Avenue &amp; 3d St., N.E.<br>
  Zenith</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">Omar Gribble, Esq.,<br>
  376 North American Building,<br>
  Zenith.</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">Dear Mr. Gribble:</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Your letter of the twentieth to hand. I must say I'm
  awfully afraid that if we go on shilly-shallying like this we'll just
  naturally lose the Allen sale. I had Allen up on the carpet day before
  yesterday, and got right down to cases. All my experience indicates that he
  means to do business. I have also looked into his financial record, which is
  fine.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">He is perfectly willing to pro rate the special
  assessment and there will be no difficulty in getting him to pay for title
  insurance.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">So let's go!</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Yours sincerely,</p>

  <p><br>
  As he read and signed it, in his correct flowing business-college hand,
  Babbitt reflected, "Now that's a good, strong letter, and clear's a bell. Now
  what the&mdash;I never told McGoun to make a third paragraph there! Wish
  she'd quit trying to improve on my dictation! But what I can't understand is:
  why can't Stan Graff or Chet Laylock write a letter like that? With punch!
  With a kick!"</p>

  <p>The most important thing he dictated that morning was the fortnightly
  form-letter, to be mimeographed and sent out to a thousand "prospects." It
  was diligently imitative of the best literary models of the day; of
  heart-to-heart-talk advertisements, "sales-pulling" letters, discourses on
  the "development of Will-power," and hand-shaking house-organs, as richly
  poured forth by the new school of Poets of Business. He had painfully written
  out a first draft, and he intoned it now like a poet delicate and
  distrait:</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">SAY, OLD MAN!</p>

  <p class="typewriter">I just want to know can I do you a whaleuva favor?
  Honest! No kidding! I know you're interested in getting a house, not merely a
  place where you hang up the old bonnet but a love-nest for the wife and
  kiddies&mdash;and maybe for the flivver out beyant (be sure and spell that
  b-e-y-a-n-t, Miss McGoun) the spud garden. Say, did you ever stop to think
  that we're here to save you trouble? That's how we make a living&mdash;folks
  don't pay us for our lovely beauty! Now take a look:</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Sit right down at the handsome carved mahogany
  escritoire and shoot us in a line telling us just what you want, and if we
  can find it we'll come hopping down your lane with the good tidings, and if
  we can't, we won't bother you. To save your time, just fill out the blank
  enclosed. On request will also send blank regarding store properties in
  Floral Heights, Silver Grove, Linton, Bellevue, and all East Side residential
  districts.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Yours for service,</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">P.S.&mdash;Just a hint of some plums we can pick for
  you&mdash;some genuine bargains that came in to-day:</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">SILVER GROVE.&mdash;Cute four-room California bungalow,
  a.m.i., garage, dandy shade tree, swell neighborhood, handy car line. $3700,
  $780 down and balance liberal, Babbitt-Thompson terms, cheaper than
  rent.</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">DORCHESTER.&mdash;A corker! Artistic two-family house,
  all oak trim, parquet floors, lovely gas log, big porches, colonial, HEATED
  ALL-WEATHER GARAGE, a bargain at $11,250.</p>

  <p><br>
  Dictation over, with its need of sitting and thinking instead of bustling
  around and making a noise and really doing something, Babbitt sat creakily
  back in his revolving desk-chair and beamed on Miss McGoun. He was conscious
  of her as a girl, of black bobbed hair against demure cheeks. A longing which
  was indistinguishable from loneliness enfeebled him. While she waited,
  tapping a long, precise pencil-point on the desk-tablet, he half identified
  her with the fairy girl of his dreams. He imagined their eyes meeting with
  terrifying recognition; imagined touching her lips with frightened reverence
  and&mdash;She was chirping, "Any more, Mist' Babbitt?" He grunted, "That
  winds it up, I guess," and turned heavily away.</p>

  <p>For all his wandering thoughts, they had never been more intimate than
  this. He often reflected, "Nev' forget how old Jake Offutt said a wise bird
  never goes love-making in his own office or his own home. Start trouble.
  Sure. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In twenty-three years of married life he had peered uneasily at every
  graceful ankle, every soft shoulder; in thought he had treasured them; but
  not once had he hazarded respectability by adventuring. Now, as he calculated
  the cost of repapering the Styles house, he was restless again, discontented
  about nothing and everything, ashamed of his discontentment, and lonely for
  the fairy girl.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">It was a morning of artistic creation. Fifteen minutes after
  the purple prose of Babbitt's form-letter, Chester Kirby Laylock, the
  resident salesman at Glen Oriole, came in to report a sale and submit an
  advertisement. Babbitt disapproved of Laylock, who sang in choirs and was
  merry at home over games of Hearts and Old Maid. He had a tenor voice, wavy
  chestnut hair, and a mustache like a camel's-hair brush. Babbitt considered
  it excusable in a family-man to growl, "Seen this new picture of the
  kid&mdash;husky little devil, eh?" but Laylock's domestic confidences were as
  bubbling as a girl's.</p>

  <p>"Say, I think I got a peach of an ad for the Glen, Mr. Babbitt. Why don't
  we try something in poetry? Honest, it'd have wonderful pulling-power.
  Listen:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Mid pleasures and palaces,<br>
  Wherever you may roam,<br>
  You just provide the little bride<br>
  And we'll provide the home.</p><br>

  <p>"Do you get it? See&mdash;like 'Home Sweet Home.' Don't you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, yes, hell yes, of course I get it. But&mdash;Oh, I think we'd
  better use something more dignified and forceful, like 'We lead, others
  follow,' or 'Eventually, why not now?' Course I believe in using poetry and
  humor and all that junk when it turns the trick, but with a high-class
  restricted development like the Glen we better stick to the more dignified
  approach, see how I mean? Well, I guess that's all, this morning, Chet."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">By a tragedy familiar to the world of art, the April
  enthusiasm of Chet Laylock served only to stimulate the talent of the older
  craftsman, George F. Babbitt. He grumbled to Stanley Graff, "That tan-colored
  voice of Chet's gets on my nerves," yet he was aroused and in one swoop he
  wrote:</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">DO YOU RESPECT YOUR LOVED ONES?</p>

  <p class="typewriter">When the last sad rites of bereavement are over, do you
  know for certain that you have done your best for the Departed? You haven't
  unless they lie in the Cemetery Beautiful,</p>

  <p class="typewriter"
     style="text-align:center">LINDEN LANE</p>

  <p class="typewriter">the only strictly up-to-date burial place in or near
  Zenith, where exquisitely gardened plots look from daisy-dotted hill-slopes
  across the smiling fields of Dorchester.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Sole agents<br>
  BABBITT-THOMPSON REALTY COMPANY<br>
  Reeves Building</p>

  <p><br>
  He rejoiced, "I guess that'll show Chan Mott and his weedy old Wildwood
  Cemetery something about modern merchandizing!"</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">He sent Mat Penniman to the recorder's office to dig out the
  names of the owners of houses which were displaying For Rent signs of other
  brokers; he talked to a man who desired to lease a store-building for a
  pool-room; he ran over the list of home-leases which were about to expire; he
  sent Thomas Bywaters, a street-car conductor who played at real estate in
  spare time, to call on side-street "prospects" who were unworthy the
  strategies of Stanley Graff. But he had spent his credulous excitement of
  creation, and these routine details annoyed him. One moment of heroism he
  had, in discovering a new way of stopping smoking.</p>

  <p>He stopped smoking at least once a month. He went through with it like the
  solid citizen he was: admitted the evils of tobacco, courageously made
  resolves, laid out plans to check the vice, tapered off his allowance of
  cigars, and expounded the pleasures of virtuousness to every one he met. He
  did everything, in fact, except stop smoking.</p>

  <p>Two months before, by ruling out a schedule, noting down the hour and
  minute of each smoke, and ecstatically increasing the intervals between
  smokes, he had brought himself down to three cigars a day. Then he had lost
  the schedule.</p>

  <p>A week ago he had invented a system of leaving his cigar-case and
  cigarette-box in an unused drawer at the bottom of the correspondence-file,
  in the outer office. "I'll just naturally be ashamed to go poking in there
  all day long, making a fool of myself before my own employees!" he reasoned.
  By the end of three days he was trained to leave his desk, walk to the file,
  take out and light a cigar, without knowing that he was doing it.</p>

  <p>This morning it was revealed to him that it had been too easy to open the
  file. Lock it, that was the thing! Inspired, he rushed out and locked up his
  cigars, his cigarettes, and even his box of safety matches; and the key to
  the file drawer he hid in his desk. But the crusading passion of it made him
  so tobacco-hungry that he immediately recovered the key, walked with
  forbidding dignity to the file, took out a cigar and a match&mdash;"but only
  one match; if ole cigar goes out, it'll by golly have to stay out!" Later,
  when the cigar did go out, he took one more match from the file, and when a
  buyer and a seller came in for a conference at eleven-thirty, naturally he
  had to offer them cigars. His conscience protested, "Why, you're smoking with
  them!" but he bullied it, "Oh, shut up! I'm busy now. Of course
  by-and-by&mdash;" There was no by-and-by, yet his belief that he had crushed
  the unclean habit made him feel noble and very happy. When he called up Paul
  Riesling he was, in his moral splendor, unusually eager.</p>

  <p>He was fonder of Paul Riesling than of any one on earth except himself and
  his daughter Tinka. They had been classmates, roommates, in the State
  University, but always he thought of Paul Riesling, with his dark slimness,
  his precisely parted hair, his nose-glasses, his hesitant speech, his
  moodiness, his love of music, as a younger brother, to be petted and
  protected. Paul had gone into his father's business, after graduation; he was
  now a wholesaler and small manufacturer of prepared-paper roofing. But
  Babbitt strenuously believed and lengthily announced to the world of Good
  Fellows that Paul could have been a great violinist or painter or writer.
  "Why say, the letters that boy sent me on his trip to the Canadian Rockies,
  they just absolutely make you see the place as if you were standing there.
  Believe me, he could have given any of these bloomin' authors a whale of a
  run for their money!"</p>

  <p>Yet on the telephone they said only:</p>

  <p>"South 343. No, no, no! I said SOUTH&mdash;South 343. Say, operator, what
  the dickens is the trouble? Can't you get me South 343? Why certainly they'll
  answer. Oh, Hello, 343? Wanta speak Mist' Riesling, Mist' Babbitt
  talking...'Lo, Paul?"</p>

  <p>"Yuh."</p>

  <p>"'S George speaking."</p>

  <p>"Yuh."</p>

  <p>"How's old socks?"</p>

  <p>"Fair to middlin'. How 're you?"</p>

  <p>"Fine, Paulibus. Well, what do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing much."</p>

  <p>"Where you been keepin' yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, just stickin' round. What's up, Georgie?"</p>

  <p>"How 'bout lil lunch 's noon?"</p>

  <p>"Be all right with me, I guess. Club?'</p>

  <p>"Yuh. Meet you there twelve-thirty."</p>

  <p>"A' right. Twelve-thirty. S' long, Georgie."</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">His morning was not sharply marked into divisions.
  Interwoven with correspondence and advertisement-writing were a thousand
  nervous details: calls from clerks who were incessantly and hopefully seeking
  five furnished rooms and bath at sixty dollars a month; advice to Mat
  Penniman on getting money out of tenants who had no money.</p>

  <p>Babbitt's virtues as a real-estate broker&mdash;as the servant of society
  in the department of finding homes for families and shops for distributors of
  food&mdash;were steadiness and diligence. He was conventionally honest, he
  kept his records of buyers and sellers complete, he had experience with
  leases and titles and an excellent memory for prices. His shoulders were
  broad enough, his voice deep enough, his relish of hearty humor strong
  enough, to establish him as one of the ruling caste of Good Fellows. Yet his
  eventual importance to mankind was perhaps lessened by his large and
  complacent ignorance of all architecture save the types of houses turned out
  by speculative builders; all landscape gardening save the use of curving
  roads, grass, and six ordinary shrubs; and all the commonest axioms of
  economics. He serenely believed that the one purpose of the real-estate
  business was to make money for George F. Babbitt. True, it was a good
  advertisement at Boosters' Club lunches, and all the varieties of Annual
  Banquets to which Good Fellows were invited, to speak sonorously of Unselfish
  Public Service, the Broker's Obligation to Keep Inviolate the Trust of His
  Clients, and a thing called Ethics, whose nature was confusing but if you had
  it you were a High-class Realtor and if you hadn't you were a shyster, a
  piker, and a fly-by-night. These virtues awakened Confidence, and enabled you
  to handle Bigger Propositions. But they didn't imply that you were to be
  impractical and refuse to take twice the value of a house if a buyer was such
  an idiot that he didn't jew you down on the asking-price.</p>

  <p>Babbitt spoke well&mdash;and often&mdash;at these orgies of commercial
  righteousness about the "realtor's function as a seer of the future
  development of the community, and as a prophetic engineer clearing the
  pathway for inevitable changes"&mdash;which meant that a real-estate broker
  could make money by guessing which way the town would grow. This guessing he
  called Vision.</p>

  <p>In an address at the Boosters' Club he had admitted, "It is at once the
  duty and the privilege of the realtor to know everything about his own city
  and its environs. Where a surgeon is a specialist on every vein and
  mysterious cell of the human body, and the engineer upon electricity in all
  its phases, or every bolt of some great bridge majestically arching o'er a
  mighty flood, the realtor must know his city, inch by inch, and all its
  faults and virtues."</p>

  <p>Though he did know the market-price, inch by inch, of certain districts of
  Zenith, he did not know whether the police force was too large or too small,
  or whether it was in alliance with gambling and prostitution. He knew the
  means of fire-proofing buildings and the relation of insurance-rates to
  fire-proofing, but he did not know how many firemen there were in the city,
  how they were trained and paid, or how complete their apparatus. He sang
  eloquently the advantages of proximity of school-buildings to rentable homes,
  but he did not know&mdash;he did not know that it was worth while to
  know&mdash;whether the city schoolrooms were properly heated, lighted,
  ventilated, furnished; he did not know how the teachers were chosen; and
  though he chanted "One of the boasts of Zenith is that we pay our teachers
  adequately," that was because he had read the statement in the
  <i>Advocate-Times</i>. Himself, he could not have given the average salary of
  teachers in Zenith or anywhere else.</p>

  <p>He had heard it said that "conditions" in the County Jail and the Zenith
  City Prison were not very "scientific;" he had, with indignation at the
  criticism of Zenith, skimmed through a report in which the notorious
  pessimist Seneca Doane, the radical lawyer, asserted that to throw boys and
  young girls into a bull-pen crammed with men suffering from syphilis,
  delirium tremens, and insanity was not the perfect way of educating them. He
  had controverted the report by growling, "Folks that think a jail ought to be
  a bloomin' Hotel Thornleigh make me sick. If people don't like a jail, let
  'em behave 'emselves and keep out of it. Besides, these reform cranks always
  exaggerate." That was the beginning and quite completely the end of his
  investigations into Zenith's charities and corrections; and as to the "vice
  districts" he brightly expressed it, "Those are things that no decent man
  monkeys with. Besides, smatter fact, I'll tell you confidentially: it's a
  protection to our daughters and to decent women to have a district where
  tough nuts can raise cain. Keeps 'em away from our own homes."</p>

  <p>As to industrial conditions, however, Babbitt had thought a great deal,
  and his opinions may be coordinated as follows:</p>

  <p>"A good labor union is of value because it keeps out radical unions, which
  would destroy property. No one ought to be forced to belong to a union,
  however. All labor agitators who try to force men to join a union should be
  hanged. In fact, just between ourselves, there oughtn't to be any unions
  allowed at all; and as it's the best way of fighting the unions, every
  business man ought to belong to an employers'-association and to the Chamber
  of Commerce. In union there is strength. So any selfish hog who doesn't join
  the Chamber of Commerce ought to be forced to."</p>

  <p>In nothing&mdash;as the expert on whose advice families moved to new
  neighborhoods to live there for a generation&mdash;was Babbitt more
  splendidly innocent than in the science of sanitation. He did not know a
  malaria-bearing mosquito from a bat; he knew nothing about tests of drinking
  water; and in the matters of plumbing and sewage he was as unlearned as he
  was voluble. He often referred to the excellence of the bathrooms in the
  houses he sold. He was fond of explaining why it was that no European ever
  bathed. Some one had told him, when he was twenty-two, that all cesspools
  were unhealthy, and he still denounced them. If a client impertinently wanted
  him to sell a house which had a cesspool, Babbitt always spoke about
  it&mdash;before accepting the house and selling it.</p>

  <p>When he laid out the Glen Oriole acreage development, when he ironed
  woodland and dipping meadow into a glenless, orioleless, sunburnt flat
  prickly with small boards displaying the names of imaginary streets, he
  righteously put in a complete sewage-system. It made him feel superior; it
  enabled him to sneer privily at the Martin Lumsen development, Avonlea, which
  had a cesspool; and it provided a chorus for the full-page advertisements in
  which he announced the beauty, convenience, cheapness, and supererogatory
  healthfulness of Glen Oriole. The only flaw was that the Glen Oriole sewers
  had insufficient outlet, so that waste remained in them, not very agreeably,
  while the Avonlea cesspool was a Waring septic tank.</p>

  <p>The whole of the Glen Oriole project was a suggestion that Babbitt, though
  he really did hate men recognized as swindlers, was not too unreasonably
  honest. Operators and buyers prefer that brokers should not be in competition
  with them as operators and buyers themselves, but attend to their clients'
  interests only. It was supposed that the Babbitt-Thompson Company were merely
  agents for Glen Oriole, serving the real owner, Jake Offutt, but the fact was
  that Babbitt and Thompson owned sixty-two per cent. of the Glen, the
  president and purchasing agent of the Zenith Street Traction Company owned
  twenty-eight per cent., and Jake Offutt (a gang-politician, a small
  manufacturer, a tobacco-chewing old farceur who enjoyed dirty politics,
  business diplomacy, and cheating at poker) had only ten per cent., which
  Babbitt and the Traction officials had given to him for "fixing" health
  inspectors and fire inspectors and a member of the State Transportation
  Commission.</p>

  <p>But Babbitt was virtuous. He advocated, though he did not practise, the
  prohibition of alcohol; he praised, though he did not obey, the laws against
  motor-speeding; he paid his debts; he contributed to the church, the Red
  Cross, and the Y. M. C. A.; he followed the custom of his clan and cheated
  only as it was sanctified by precedent; and he never descended to
  trickery&mdash;though, as he explained to Paul Riesling:</p>

  <p>"Course I don't mean to say that every ad I write is literally true or
  that I always believe everything I say when I give some buyer a good strong
  selling-spiel. You see&mdash;you see it's like this: In the first place,
  maybe the owner of the property exaggerated when he put it into my hands, and
  it certainly isn't my place to go proving my principal a liar! And then most
  folks are so darn crooked themselves that they expect a fellow to do a little
  lying, so if I was fool enough to never whoop the ante I'd get the credit for
  lying anyway! In self-defense I got to toot my own horn, like a lawyer
  defending a client&mdash;his bounden duty, ain't it, to bring out the poor
  dub's good points? Why, the Judge himself would bawl out a lawyer that
  didn't, even if they both knew the guy was guilty! But even so, I don't pad
  out the truth like Cecil Rountree or Thayer or the rest of these realtors.
  Fact, I think a fellow that's willing to deliberately up and profit by lying
  ought to be shot!"</p>

  <p>Babbitt's value to his clients was rarely better shown than this morning,
  in the conference at eleven-thirty between himself, Conrad Lyte, and
  Archibald Purdy.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">Conrad Lyte was a real-estate speculator. He was a nervous
  speculator. Before he gambled he consulted bankers, lawyers, architects,
  contracting builders, and all of their clerks and stenographers who were
  willing to be cornered and give him advice. He was a bold entrepreneur, and
  he desired nothing more than complete safety in his investments, freedom from
  attention to details, and the thirty or forty per cent. profit which,
  according to all authorities, a pioneer deserves for his risks and foresight.
  He was a stubby man with a cap-like mass of short gray curls and clothes
  which, no matter how well cut, seemed shaggy. Below his eyes were
  semicircular hollows, as though silver dollars had been pressed against them
  and had left an imprint.</p>

  <p>Particularly and always Lyte consulted Babbitt, and trusted in his slow
  cautiousness.</p>

  <p>Six months ago Babbitt had learned that one Archibald Purdy, a grocer in
  the indecisive residential district known as Linton, was talking of opening a
  butcher shop beside his grocery. Looking up the ownership of adjoining
  parcels of land, Babbitt found that Purdy owned his present shop but did not
  own the one available lot adjoining. He advised Conrad Lyte to purchase this
  lot, for eleven thousand dollars, though an appraisal on a basis of rents did
  not indicate its value as above nine thousand. The rents, declared Babbitt,
  were too low; and by waiting they could make Purdy come to their price. (This
  was Vision.) He had to bully Lyte into buying. His first act as agent for
  Lyte was to increase the rent of the battered store-building on the lot. The
  tenant said a number of rude things, but he paid.</p>

  <p>Now, Purdy seemed ready to buy, and his delay was going to cost him ten
  thousand extra dollars&mdash;the reward paid by the community to Mr. Conrad
  Lyte for the virtue of employing a broker who had Vision and who understood
  Talking Points, Strategic Values, Key Situations, Under appraisals, and the
  Psychology of Salesmanship.</p>

  <p>Lyte came to the conference exultantly. He was fond of Babbitt, this
  morning, and called him "old hoss." Purdy, the grocer, a long-nosed man and
  solemn, seemed to care less for Babbitt and for Vision, but Babbitt met him
  at the street door of the office and guided him toward the private room with
  affectionate little cries of "This way, Brother Purdy!" He took from the
  correspondence-file the entire box of cigars and forced them on his guests.
  He pushed their chairs two inches forward and three inches back, which gave
  an hospitable note, then leaned back in his desk-chair and looked plump and
  jolly. But he spoke to the weakling grocer with firmness.</p>

  <p>"Well, Brother Purdy, we been having some pretty tempting offers from
  butchers and a slew of other folks for that lot next to your store, but I
  persuaded Brother Lyte that we ought to give you a shot at the property
  first. I said to Lyte, 'It'd be a rotten shame,' I said, 'if somebody went
  and opened a combination grocery and meat market right next door and ruined
  Purdy's nice little business.' Especially&mdash;" Babbitt leaned forward, and
  his voice was harsh, "&mdash;it would be hard luck if one of these
  cash-and-carry chain-stores got in there and started cutting prices below
  cost till they got rid of competition and forced you to the wall!"</p>

  <p>Purdy snatched his thin hands from his pockets, pulled up his trousers,
  thrust his hands back into his pockets, tilted in the heavy oak chair, and
  tried to look amused, as he struggled:</p>

  <p>"Yes, they're bad competition. But I guess you don't realize the Pulling
  Power that Personality has in a neighborhood business."</p>

  <p>The great Babbitt smiled. "That's so. Just as you feel, old man. We
  thought we'd give you first chance. All right then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now look here!" Purdy wailed. "I know f'r a fact that a piece of property
  'bout same size, right near, sold for less 'n eighty-five hundred, 'twa'n't
  two years ago, and here you fellows are asking me twenty-four thousand
  dollars! Why, I'd have to mortgage&mdash;I wouldn't mind so much paying
  twelve thousand but&mdash;Why good God, Mr. Babbitt, you're asking more 'n
  twice its value! And threatening to ruin me if I don't take it!"</p>

  <p>"Purdy, I don't like your way of talking! I don't like it one little bit!
  Supposing Lyte and I were stinking enough to want to ruin any fellow human,
  don't you suppose we know it's to our own selfish interest to have everybody
  in Zenith prosperous? But all this is beside the point. Tell you what we'll
  do: We'll come down to twenty-three thousand-five thousand down and the rest
  on mortgage&mdash;and if you want to wreck the old shack and rebuild, I guess
  I can get Lyte here to loosen up for a building-mortgage on good liberal
  terms. Heavens, man, we'd be glad to oblige you! We don't like these foreign
  grocery trusts any better 'n you do! But it isn't reasonable to expect us to
  sacrifice eleven thousand or more just for neighborliness, <i>is</i> it! How
  about it, Lyte? You willing to come down?"</p>

  <p>By warmly taking Purdy's part, Babbitt persuaded the benevolent Mr. Lyte
  to reduce his price to twenty-one thousand dollars. At the right moment
  Babbitt snatched from a drawer the agreement he had had Miss McGoun type out
  a week ago and thrust it into Purdy's hands. He genially shook his fountain
  pen to make certain that it was flowing, handed it to Purdy, and approvingly
  watched him sign.</p>

  <p>The work of the world was being done. Lyte had made something over nine
  thousand dollars, Babbitt had made a four-hundred-and-fifty dollar
  commission, Purdy had, by the sensitive mechanism of modern finance, been
  provided with a business-building, and soon the happy inhabitants of Linton
  would have meat lavished upon them at prices only a little higher than those
  down-town.</p>

  <p>It had been a manly battle, but after it Babbitt drooped. This was the
  only really amusing contest he had been planning. There was nothing ahead
  save details of leases, appraisals, mortgages.</p>

  <p>He muttered, "Makes me sick to think of Lyte carrying off most of the
  profit when I did all the work, the old skinflint! And&mdash;What else have I
  got to do to-day?...Like to take a good long vacation. Motor trip.
  Something." He sprang up, rekindled by the thought of lunching with Paul
  Riesling.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">Babbitt's preparations for leaving the office to its feeble
  self during the hour and a half of his lunch-period were somewhat less
  elaborate than the plans for a general European war.</p>

  <p>He fretted to Miss McGoun, "What time you going to lunch? Well, make sure
  Miss Bannigan is in then. Explain to her that if Wiedenfeldt calls up, she's
  to tell him I'm already having the title traced. And oh, b' the way, remind
  me to-morrow to have Penniman trace it. Now if anybody comes in looking for a
  cheap house, remember we got to shove that Bangor Road place off onto
  somebody. If you need me, I'll be at the Athletic Club.
  And&mdash;uh&mdash;And&mdash;uh&mdash;I'll be back by two."</p>

  <p>He dusted the cigar-ashes off his vest. He placed a difficult unanswered
  letter on the pile of unfinished work, that he might not fail to attend to it
  that afternoon. (For three noons, now, he had placed the same letter on the
  unfinished pile.) He scrawled on a sheet of yellow backing-paper the
  memorandum: "See abt apt h drs," which gave him an agreeable feeling of
  having already seen about the apartment-house doors.</p>

  <p>He discovered that he was smoking another cigar. He threw it away,
  protesting, "Darn it, I thought you'd quit this darn smoking!" He
  courageously returned the cigar-box to the correspondence-file, locked it up,
  hid the key in a more difficult place, and raged, "Ought to take care of
  myself. And need more exercise&mdash;walk to the club, every single
  noon&mdash;just what I'll do&mdash;every noon-cut out this motoring all the
  time."</p>

  <p>The resolution made him feel exemplary. Immediately after it he decided
  that this noon it was too late to walk.</p>

  <p>It took but little more time to start his car and edge it into the traffic
  than it would have taken to walk the three and a half blocks to the club.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">As he drove he glanced with the fondness of familiarity at
  the buildings.</p>

  <p>A stranger suddenly dropped into the business-center of Zenith could not
  have told whether he was in a city of Oregon or Georgia, Ohio or Maine,
  Oklahoma or Manitoba. But to Babbitt every inch was individual and stirring.
  As always he noted that the California Building across the way was three
  stories lower, therefore three stories less beautiful, than his own Reeves
  Building. As always when he passed the Parthenon Shoe Shine Parlor, a
  one-story hut which beside the granite and red-brick ponderousness of the old
  California Building resembled a bath-house under a cliff, he commented,
  "Gosh, ought to get my shoes shined this afternoon. Keep forgetting it." At
  the Simplex Office Furniture Shop, the National Cash Register Agency, he
  yearned for a dictaphone, for a typewriter which would add and multiply, as a
  poet yearns for quartos or a physician for radium.</p>

  <p>At the Nobby Men's Wear Shop he took his left hand off the steering-wheel
  to touch his scarf, and thought well of himself as one who bought expensive
  ties "and could pay cash for 'em, too, by golly;" and at the United Cigar
  Store, with its crimson and gold alertness, he reflected, "Wonder if I need
  some cigars&mdash;idiot&mdash;plumb forgot&mdash;going t' cut down my fool
  smoking." He looked at his bank, the Miners' and Drovers' National, and
  considered how clever and solid he was to bank with so marbled an
  establishment. His high moment came in the clash of traffic when he was
  halted at the corner beneath the lofty Second National Tower. His car was
  banked with four others in a line of steel restless as cavalry, while the
  cross town traffic, limousines and enormous moving-vans and insistent
  motor-cycles, poured by; on the farther corner, pneumatic riveters rang on
  the sun-plated skeleton of a new building; and out of this tornado flashed
  the inspiration of a familiar face, and a fellow Booster shouted, "H' are
  you, George!" Babbitt waved in neighborly affection, and slid on with the
  traffic as the policeman lifted his hand. He noted how quickly his car picked
  up. He felt superior and powerful, like a shuttle of polished steel darting
  in a vast machine.</p>

  <p>As always he ignored the next two blocks, decayed blocks not yet reclaimed
  from the grime and shabbiness of the Zenith of 1885. While he was passing the
  five-and-ten-cent store, the Dakota Lodging House, Concordia Hall with its
  lodge-rooms and the offices of fortune-tellers and chiropractors, he thought
  of how much money he made, and he boasted a little and worried a little and
  did old familiar sums:</p>

  <p>"Four hundred fifty plunks this morning from the Lyte deal. But taxes due.
  Let's see: I ought to pull out eight thousand net this year, and save fifteen
  hundred of that&mdash;no, not if I put up garage and&mdash;Let's see: six
  hundred and forty clear last month, and twelve times six-forty
  makes&mdash;makes&mdash;let see: six times twelve is seventy-two hundred
  and&mdash;Oh rats, anyway, I'll make eight thousand&mdash;gee now, that's not
  so bad; mighty few fellows pulling down eight thousand dollars a
  year&mdash;eight thousand good hard iron dollars&mdash;bet there isn't more
  than five per cent. of the people in the whole United States that make more
  than Uncle George does, by golly! Right up at the top of the heap!
  But&mdash;Way expenses are&mdash;Family wasting gasoline, and always dressed
  like millionaires, and sending that eighty a month to Mother&mdash;And all
  these stenographers and salesmen gouging me for every cent they can
  get&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The effect of his scientific budget-planning was that he felt at once
  triumphantly wealthy and perilously poor, and in the midst of these
  dissertations he stopped his car, rushed into a small news-and-miscellany
  shop, and bought the electric cigar-lighter which he had coveted for a week.
  He dodged his conscience by being jerky and noisy, and by shouting at the
  clerk, "Guess this will prett' near pay for itself in matches, eh?"</p>

  <p>It was a pretty thing, a nickeled cylinder with an almost silvery socket,
  to be attached to the dashboard of his car. It was not only, as the placard
  on the counter observed, "a dandy little refinement, lending the last touch
  of class to a gentleman's auto," but a priceless time-saver. By freeing him
  from halting the car to light a match, it would in a month or two easily save
  ten minutes.</p>

  <p>As he drove on he glanced at it. "Pretty nice. Always wanted one," he said
  wistfully. "The one thing a smoker needs, too."</p>

  <p>Then he remembered that he had given up smoking.</p>

  <p>"Darn it!" he mourned. "Oh well, I suppose I'll hit a cigar once in a
  while. And&mdash;Be a great convenience for other folks. Might make just the
  difference in getting chummy with some fellow that would put over a sale.
  And&mdash;Certainly looks nice there. Certainly is a mighty clever little
  jigger. Gives the last touch of refinement and class. I&mdash;By golly, I
  guess I can afford it if I want to! Not going to be the only member of this
  family that never has a single doggone luxury!"</p>

  <p>Thus, laden with treasure, after three and a half blocks of romantic
  adventure, he drove up to the club.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">The Zenith Athletic Club is not athletic and it isn't
  exactly a club, but it is Zenith in perfection. It has an active and
  smoke-misted billiard room, it is represented by baseball and football teams,
  and in the pool and the gymnasium a tenth of the members sporadically try to
  reduce. But most of its three thousand members use it as a cafe in which to
  lunch, play cards, tell stories, meet customers, and entertain out-of town
  uncles at dinner. It is the largest club in the city, and its chief hatred is
  the conservative Union Club, which all sound members of the Athletic call "a
  rotten, snobbish, dull, expensive old hole&mdash;not one Good Mixer in the
  place&mdash;you couldn't hire me to join." Statistics show that no member of
  the Athletic has ever refused election to the Union, and of those who are
  elected, sixty-seven per cent. resign from the Athletic and are thereafter
  heard to say, in the drowsy sanctity of the Union lounge, "The Athletic would
  be a pretty good hotel, if it were more exclusive."</p>

  <p>The Athletic Club building is nine stories high, yellow brick with glassy
  roof-garden above and portico of huge limestone columns below. The lobby,
  with its thick pillars of porous Caen stone, its pointed vaulting, and a
  brown glazed-tile floor like well-baked bread-crust, is a combination of
  cathedral-crypt and rathskellar. The members rush into the lobby as though
  they were shopping and hadn't much time for it. Thus did Babbitt enter, and
  to the group standing by the cigar-counter he whooped, "How's the boys? How's
  the boys? Well, well, fine day!"</p>

  <p>Jovially they whooped back&mdash;Vergil Gunch, the coal-dealer, Sidney
  Finkelstein, the ladies'-ready-to-wear buyer for Parcher &amp; Stein's
  department-store, and Professor Joseph K. Pumphrey, owner of the Riteway
  Business College and instructor in Public Speaking, Business English,
  Scenario Writing, and Commercial Law. Though Babbitt admired this savant, and
  appreciated Sidney Finkelstein as "a mighty smart buyer and a good liberal
  spender," it was to Vergil Gunch that he turned with enthusiasm. Mr. Gunch
  was president of the Boosters' Club, a weekly lunch-club, local chapter of a
  national organization which promoted sound business and friendliness among
  Regular Fellows. He was also no less an official than Esteemed Leading Knight
  in the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, and it was rumored that at
  the next election he would be a candidate for Exalted Ruler. He was a jolly
  man, given to oratory and to chumminess with the arts. He called on the
  famous actors and vaudeville artists when they came to town, gave them
  cigars, addressed them by their first names,
  and&mdash;sometimes&mdash;succeeded in bringing them to the Boosters' lunches
  to give The Boys a Free Entertainment. He was a large man with hair <i>en
  brosse</i>, and he knew the latest jokes, but he played poker close to the
  chest. It was at his party that Babbitt had sucked in the virus of to-day's
  restlessness.</p>

  <p>Gunch shouted, "How's the old Bolsheviki? How do you feel, the morning
  after the night before?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, boy! Some head! That was a regular party you threw, Verg! Hope you
  haven't forgotten I took that last cute little jack-pot!" Babbitt bellowed.
  (He was three feet from Gunch.)</p>

  <p>"That's all right now! What I'll hand you next time, Georgie! Say, juh
  notice in the paper the way the New York Assembly stood up to the Reds?"</p>

  <p>"You bet I did. That was fine, eh? Nice day to-day."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's one mighty fine spring day, but nights still cold."</p>

  <p>"Yeh, you're right they are! Had to have coupla blankets last night, out
  on the sleeping-porch. Say, Sid," Babbitt turned to Finkelstein, the buyer,
  "got something wanta ask you about. I went out and bought me an electric
  cigar-lighter for the car, this noon, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good hunch!" said Finkelstein, while even the learned Professor Pumphrey,
  a bulbous man with a pepper-and-salt cutaway and a pipe-organ voice,
  commented, "That makes a dandy accessory. Cigar-lighter gives tone to the
  dashboard."</p>

  <p>"Yep, finally decided I'd buy me one. Got the best on the market, the
  clerk said it was. Paid five bucks for it. Just wondering if I got stuck.
  What do they charge for 'em at the store, Sid?"</p>

  <p>Finkelstein asserted that five dollars was not too great a sum, not for a
  really high-class lighter which was suitably nickeled and provided with
  connections of the very best quality. "I always say&mdash;and believe me, I
  base it on a pretty fairly extensive mercantile experience&mdash;the best is
  the cheapest in the long run. Of course if a fellow wants to be a Jew about
  it, he can get cheap junk, but in the long <i>run</i>, the cheapest thing
  is&mdash;the best you can get! Now you take here just th' other day: I got a
  new top for my old boat and some upholstery, and I paid out a hundred and
  twenty-six fifty, and of course a lot of fellows would say that was too
  much&mdash;Lord, if the Old Folks&mdash;they live in one of these hick towns
  up-state and they simply can't get onto the way a city fellow's mind works,
  and then, of course, they're Jews, and they'd lie right down and die if they
  knew Sid had anted up a hundred and twenty-six bones. But I don't figure I
  was stuck, George, not a bit. Machine looks brand new now&mdash;not that it's
  so darned old, of course; had it less 'n three years, but I give it hard
  service; never drive less 'n a hundred miles on Sunday and, uh&mdash;Oh, I
  don't really think you got stuck, George. In the <i>long</i> run, the best
  is, you might say, it's unquestionably the cheapest."</p>

  <p>"That's right," said Vergil Gunch. "That's the way I look at it. If a
  fellow is keyed up to what you might call intensive living, the way you get
  it here in Zenith&mdash;all the hustle and mental activity that's going on
  with a bunch of live-wires like the Boosters and here in the Z.A.C., why,
  he's got to save his nerves by having the best."</p>

  <p>Babbitt nodded his head at every fifth word in the roaring rhythm; and by
  the conclusion, in Gunch's renowned humorous vein, he was enchanted:</p>

  <p>"Still, at that, George, don't know's you can afford it. I've heard your
  business has been kind of under the eye of the gov'ment since you stole the
  tail of Eathorne Park and sold it!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're a great little josher, Verg. But when it comes to kidding, how
  about this report that you stole the black marble steps off the post-office
  and sold 'em for high-grade coal!" In delight Babbitt patted Gunch's back,
  stroked his arm.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, but what I want to know is: who's the real-estate shark
  that bought that coal for his apartment-houses?"</p>

  <p>"I guess that'll hold you for a while, George!" said Finkelstein. "I'll
  tell you, though, boys, what I did hear: George's missus went into the gents'
  wear department at Parcher's to buy him some collars, and before she could
  give his neck-size the clerk slips her some thirteens. 'How juh know the
  size?' says Mrs. Babbitt, and the clerk says, 'Men that let their wives buy
  collars for 'em always wear thirteen, madam.' How's that! That's pretty good,
  eh? How's that, eh? I guess that'll about fix you, George!"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;" Babbitt sought for amiable insults in answer. He
  stopped, stared at the door. Paul Riesling was coming in. Babbitt cried, "See
  you later, boys," and hastened across the lobby. He was, just then, neither
  the sulky child of the sleeping-porch, the domestic tyrant of the breakfast
  table, the crafty money-changer of the Lyte-Purdy conference, nor the blaring
  Good Fellow, the Josher and Regular Guy, of the Athletic Club. He was an
  older brother to Paul Riesling, swift to defend him, admiring him with a
  proud and credulous love passing the love of women. Paul and he shook hands
  solemnly; they smiled as shyly as though they had been parted three years,
  not three days&mdash;and they said:</p>

  <p>"How's the old horse-thief?"</p>

  <p>"All right, I guess. How're you, you poor shrimp?"</p>

  <p>"I'm first-rate, you second-hand hunk o' cheese."</p>

  <p>Reassured thus of their high fondness, Babbitt grunted, "You're a fine
  guy, you are! Ten minutes late!" Riesling snapped, "Well, you're lucky to
  have a chance to lunch with a gentleman!" They grinned and went into the
  Neronian washroom, where a line of men bent over the bowls inset along a
  prodigious slab of marble as in religious prostration before their own images
  in the massy mirror. Voices thick, satisfied, authoritative, hurtled along
  the marble walls, bounded from the ceiling of lavender-bordered milky tiles,
  while the lords of the city, the barons of insurance and law and fertilizers
  and motor tires, laid down the law for Zenith; announced that the day was
  warm-indeed, indisputably of spring; that wages were too high and the
  interest on mortgages too low; that Babe Ruth, the eminent player of
  baseball, was a noble man; and that "those two nuts at the Climax Vaudeville
  Theater this week certainly are a slick pair of actors." Babbitt, though
  ordinarily his voice was the surest and most episcopal of all, was silent. In
  the presence of the slight dark reticence of Paul Riesling, he was awkward,
  he desired to be quiet and firm and deft.</p>

  <p>The entrance lobby of the Athletic Club was Gothic, the washroom Roman
  Imperial, the lounge Spanish Mission, and the reading-room in Chinese
  Chippendale, but the gem of the club was the dining-room, the masterpiece of
  Ferdinand Reitman, Zenith's busiest architect. It was lofty and
  half-timbered, with Tudor leaded casements, an oriel, a somewhat musicianless
  musicians'-gallery, and tapestries believed to illustrate the granting of
  Magna Charta. The open beams had been hand-adzed at Jake Offutt's car-body
  works, the hinge; were of hand-wrought iron, the wainscot studded with
  handmade wooden pegs, and at one end of the room was a heraldic and hooded
  stone fireplace which the club's advertising-pamphlet asserted to be not only
  larger than any of the fireplaces in European castles but of a draught
  incomparably more scientific. It was also much cleaner, as no fire had ever
  been built in it.</p>

  <p>Half of the tables were mammoth slabs which seated twenty or thirty men.
  Babbitt usually sat at the one near the door, with a group including Gunch,
  Finkelstein, Professor Pumphrey, Howard Littlefield, his neighbor, T.
  Cholmondeley Frink, the poet and advertising-agent, and Orville Jones, whose
  laundry was in many ways the best in Zenith. They composed a club within the
  club, and merrily called themselves "The Roughnecks." To-day as he passed
  their table the Roughnecks greeted him, "Come on, sit in! You 'n' Paul too
  proud to feed with poor folks? Afraid somebody might stick you for a bottle
  of Bevo, George? Strikes me you swells are getting awful darn exclusive!"</p>

  <p>He thundered, "You bet! We can't afford to have our reps ruined by being
  seen with you tightwads!" and guided Paul to one of the small tables beneath
  the musicians'-gallery. He felt guilty. At the Zenith Athletic Club, privacy
  was very bad form. But he wanted Paul to himself.</p>

  <p>That morning he had advocated lighter lunches and now he ordered nothing
  but English mutton chop, radishes, peas, deep-dish apple pie, a bit of
  cheese, and a pot of coffee with cream, adding, as he did invariably, "And
  uh&mdash;Oh, and you might give me an order of French fried potatoes." When
  the chop came he vigorously peppered it and salted it. He always peppered and
  salted his meat, and vigorously, before tasting it.</p>

  <p>Paul and he took up the spring-like quality of the spring, the virtues of
  the electric cigar-lighter, and the action of the New York State Assembly. It
  was not till Babbitt was thick and disconsolate with mutton grease that he
  flung out:</p>

  <p>"I wound up a nice little deal with Conrad Lyte this morning that put five
  hundred good round plunks in my pocket. Pretty nice&mdash;pretty nice! And
  yet&mdash;I don't know what's the matter with me to-day. Maybe it's an attack
  of spring fever, or staying up too late at Verg Gunch's, or maybe it's just
  the winter's work piling up, but I've felt kind of down in the mouth all day
  long. Course I wouldn't beef about it to the fellows at the Roughnecks' Table
  there, but you&mdash;Ever feel that way, Paul? Kind of comes over me: here
  I've pretty much done all the things I ought to; supported my family, and got
  a good house and a six-cylinder car, and built up a nice little business, and
  I haven't any vices 'specially, except smoking&mdash;and I'm practically
  cutting that out, by the way. And I belong to the church, and play enough
  golf to keep in trim, and I only associate with good decent fellows. And yet,
  even so, I don't know that I'm entirely satisfied!"</p>

  <p>It was drawled out, broken by shouts from the neighboring tables, by
  mechanical love-making to the waitress, by stertorous grunts as the coffee
  filled him with dizziness and indigestion. He was apologetic and doubtful,
  and it was Paul, with his thin voice, who pierced the fog:</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, George, you don't suppose it's any novelty to me to find that
  we hustlers, that think we're so all-fired successful, aren't getting much
  out of it? You look as if you expected me to report you as seditious! You
  know what my own life's been."</p>

  <p>"I know, old man."</p>

  <p>"I ought to have been a fiddler, and I'm a pedler of tar-roofing! And
  Zilla&mdash;Oh, I don't want to squeal, but you know as well as I do about
  how inspiring a wife she is...Typical instance last evening: We went to the
  movies. There was a big crowd waiting in the lobby, us at the tail-end. She
  began to push right through it with her 'Sir, how dare you?'
  manner&mdash;Honestly, sometimes when I look at her and see how she's always
  so made up and stinking of perfume and looking for trouble and kind of always
  yelping, 'I tell yuh I'm a lady, damn yuh!'&mdash;why, I want to kill her!
  Well, she keeps elbowing through the crowd, me after her, feeling good and
  ashamed, till she's almost up to the velvet rope and ready to be the next let
  in. But there was a little squirt of a man there&mdash;probably been waiting
  half an hour&mdash;I kind of admired the little cuss&mdash;and he turns on
  Zilla and says, perfectly polite, 'Madam, why are you trying to push past
  me?' And she simply&mdash;God, I was so ashamed!&mdash;she rips out at him,
  'You're no gentleman,' and she drags me into it and hollers, 'Paul, this
  person insulted me!' and the poor skate he got ready to fight.</p>

  <p>"I made out I hadn't heard them&mdash;sure! same as you wouldn't hear a
  boiler-factory!&mdash;and I tried to look away&mdash;I can tell you exactly
  how every tile looks in the ceiling of that lobby; there's one with brown
  spots on it like the face of the devil&mdash;and all the time the people
  there&mdash;they were packed in like sardines&mdash;they kept making remarks
  about us, and Zilla went right on talking about the little chap, and
  screeching that 'folks like him oughtn't to be admitted in a place that's
  <i>supposed</i> to be for ladies and gentlemen,' and 'Paul, will you kindly
  call the manager, so I can report this dirty rat?' and&mdash;Oof! Maybe I
  wasn't glad when I could sneak inside and hide in the dark!</p>

  <p>"After twenty-four years of that kind of thing, you don't expect me to
  fall down and foam at the mouth when you hint that this sweet, clean,
  respectable, moral life isn't all it's cracked up to be, do you? I can't even
  talk about it, except to you, because anybody else would think I was yellow.
  Maybe I am. Don't care any longer...Gosh, you've had to stand a lot of
  whining from me, first and last, Georgie!"</p>

  <p>"Rats, now, Paul, you've never really what you could call whined.
  Sometimes&mdash;I'm always blowing to Myra and the kids about what a whale of
  a realtor I am, and yet sometimes I get a sneaking idea I'm not such a
  Pierpont Morgan as I let on to be. But if I ever do help by jollying you
  along, old Paulski, I guess maybe Saint Pete may let me in after all!"</p>

  <p>"Yuh, you're an old blow-hard, Georgie, you cheerful cut-throat, but
  you've certainly kept me going."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you divorce Zilla?"</p>

  <p>"Why don't I! If I only could! If she'd just give me the chance! You
  couldn't hire her to divorce me, no, nor desert me. She's too fond of her
  three squares and a few pounds of nut-center chocolates in between. If she'd
  only be what they call unfaithful to me! George, I don't want to be too much
  of a stinker; back in college I'd 've thought a man who could say that ought
  to be shot at sunrise. But honestly, I'd be tickled to death if she'd really
  go making love with somebody. Fat chance! Of course she'll flirt with
  anything&mdash;you know how she holds hands and laughs&mdash;that
  laugh&mdash;that horrible brassy laugh&mdash;the way she yaps, 'You naughty
  man, you better be careful or my big husband will be after you!'&mdash;and
  the guy looking me over and thinking, 'Why, you cute little thing, you run
  away now or I'll spank you!' And she'll let him go just far enough so she
  gets some excitement out of it and then she'll begin to do the injured
  innocent and have a beautiful time wailing, 'I didn't think you were that
  kind of a person.' They talk about these demi-vierges in stories&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"These <i>whats</i>?"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;but the wise, hard, corseted, old married women like Zilla are
  worse than any bobbed-haired girl that ever went boldly out into this-here
  storm of life&mdash;and kept her umbrella slid up her sleeve! But rats, you
  know what Zilla is. How she nags&mdash;nags&mdash;nags. How she wants
  everything I can buy her, and a lot that I can't, and how absolutely
  unreasonable she is, and when I get sore and try to have it out with her she
  plays the Perfect Lady so well that even I get fooled and get all tangled up
  in a lot of 'Why did you say's' and 'I didn't mean's.' I'll tell you,
  Georgie: You know my tastes are pretty fairly simple&mdash;in the matter of
  food, at least. Course, as you're always complaining, I do like decent
  cigars&mdash;not those Flor de Cabagos you're smoking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's all right now! That's a good two-for. By the way, Paul, did I tell
  you I decided to practically cut out smok&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes you&mdash;At the same time, if I can't get what I like, why, I can do
  without it. I don't mind sitting down to burnt steak, with canned peaches and
  store cake for a thrilling little dessert afterwards, but I do draw the line
  at having to sympathize with Zilla because she's so rotten bad-tempered that
  the cook has quit, and she's been so busy sitting in a dirty lace negligee
  all afternoon, reading about some brave manly Western hero, that she hasn't
  had time to do any cooking. You're always talking about
  'morals'&mdash;meaning monogamy, I suppose. You've been the rock of ages to
  me, all right, but you're essentially a simp. You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where d' you get that 'simp,' little man? Let me tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;love to look earnest and inform the world that it's the 'duty of
  responsible business men to be strictly moral, as an example to the
  community.' In fact you're so earnest about morality, old Georgie, that I
  hate to think how essentially immoral you must be underneath. All right, you
  can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait now! What's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;talk about morals all you want to, old thing, but believe me, if
  it hadn't been for you and an occasional evening playing the violin to
  Terrill O'Farrell's 'cello, and three or four darling girls that let me
  forget this beastly joke they call 'respectable life,' I'd 've killed myself
  years ago.</p>

  <p>"And business! The roofing business! Roofs for cowsheds! Oh, I don't mean
  I haven't had a lot of fun out of the Game; out of putting it over on the
  labor unions, and seeing a big check coming in, and the business increasing.
  But what's the use of it? You know, my business isn't distributing
  roofing&mdash;it's principally keeping my competitors from distributing
  roofing. Same with you. All we do is cut each other's throats and make the
  public pay for it!"</p>

  <p>"Look here now, Paul! You're pretty darn near talking socialism!"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, of course I don't really exactly mean that&mdash;I s'pose.
  Course&mdash;competition&mdash;brings out the best&mdash;survival of the
  fittest&mdash;but&mdash;But I mean: Take all these fellows we know, the kind
  right here in the club now, that seem to be perfectly content with their
  home-life and their businesses, and that boost Zenith and the Chamber of
  Commerce and holler for a million population. I bet if you could cut into
  their heads you'd find that one-third of 'em are sure-enough satisfied with
  their wives and kids and friends and their offices; and one-third feel kind
  of restless but won't admit it; and one-third are miserable and know it. They
  hate the whole peppy, boosting, go-ahead game, and they're bored by their
  wives and think their families are fools&mdash;at least when they come to
  forty or forty-five they're bored&mdash;and they hate business, and they'd
  go&mdash;Why do you suppose there's so many 'mysterious' suicides? Why do you
  suppose so many Substantial Citizens jumped right into the war? Think it was
  all patriotism?"</p>

  <p>Babbitt snorted, "What do you expect? Think we were sent into the world to
  have a soft time and&mdash;what is it?&mdash;'float on flowery beds of ease'?
  Think Man was just made to be happy?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? Though I've never discovered anybody that knew what the deuce
  Man really was made for!"</p>

  <p>"Well we know&mdash;not just in the Bible alone, but it stands to
  reason&mdash;a man who doesn't buckle down and do his duty, even if it does
  bore him sometimes, is nothing but a&mdash;well, he's simply a weakling.
  Mollycoddle, in fact! And what do you advocate? Come down to cases! If a man
  is bored by his wife, do you seriously mean he has a right to chuck her and
  take a sneak, or even kill himself?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, I don't know what 'rights' a man has! And I don't know the
  solution of boredom. If I did, I'd be the one philosopher that had the cure
  for living. But I do know that about ten times as many people find their
  lives dull, and unnecessarily dull, as ever admit it; and I do believe that
  if we busted out and admitted it sometimes, instead of being nice and patient
  and loyal for sixty years, and then nice and patient and dead for the rest of
  eternity, why, maybe, possibly, we might make life more fun."</p>

  <p>They drifted into a maze of speculation. Babbitt was elephantishly uneasy.
  Paul was bold, but not quite sure about what he was being bold. Now and then
  Babbitt suddenly agreed with Paul in an admission which contradicted all his
  defense of duty and Christian patience, and at each admission he had a
  curious reckless joy. He said at last:</p>

  <p>"Look here, old Paul, you do a lot of talking about kicking things in the
  face, but you never kick. Why don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody does. Habit too strong. But&mdash;Georgie, I've been thinking of
  one mild bat&mdash;oh, don't worry, old pillar of monogamy; it's highly
  proper. It seems to be settled now, isn't it&mdash;though of course Zilla
  keeps rooting for a nice expensive vacation in New York and Atlantic City,
  with the bright lights and the bootlegged cocktails and a bunch of
  lounge-lizards to dance with&mdash;but the Babbitts and the Rieslings are
  sure-enough going to Lake Sunasquam, aren't we? Why couldn't you and I make
  some excuse&mdash;say business in New York&mdash;and get up to Maine four or
  five days before they do, and just loaf by ourselves and smoke and cuss and
  be natural?"</p>

  <p>"Great! Great idea!" Babbitt admired.</p>

  <p>Not for fourteen years had he taken a holiday without his wife, and
  neither of them quite believed they could commit this audacity. Many members
  of the Athletic Club did go camping without their wives, but they were
  officially dedicated to fishing and hunting, whereas the sacred and
  unchangeable sports of Babbitt and Paul Riesling were golfing, motoring, and
  bridge. For either the fishermen or the golfers to have changed their habits
  would have been an infraction of their self-imposed discipline which would
  have shocked all right-thinking and regularized citizens.</p>

  <p>Babbitt blustered, "Why don't we just put our foot down and say, 'We're
  going on ahead of you, and that's all there is to it!' Nothing criminal in
  it. Simply say to Zilla&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't say anything to Zilla simply. Why, Georgie, she's almost as
  much of a moralist as you are, and if I told her the truth she'd believe we
  were going to meet some dames in New York. And even Myra&mdash;she never nags
  you, the way Zilla does, but she'd worry. She'd say, 'Don't you <i>want</i>
  me to go to Maine with you? I shouldn't dream of going unless you wanted me;'
  and you'd give in to save her feelings. Oh, the devil! Let's have a shot at
  duck-pins."</p>

  <p>During the game of duck-pins, a juvenile form of bowling, Paul was silent.
  As they came down the steps of the club, not more than half an hour after the
  time at which Babbitt had sternly told Miss McGoun he would be back, Paul
  sighed, "Look here, old man, oughtn't to talked about Zilla way I did."</p>

  <p>"Rats, old man, it lets off steam."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know! After spending all noon sneering at the conventional stuff,
  I'm conventional enough to be ashamed of saving my life by busting out with
  my fool troubles!"</p>

  <p>"Old Paul, your nerves are kind of on the bum. I'm going to take you away.
  I'm going to rig this thing. I'm going to have an important deal in New York
  and&mdash;and sure, of course!&mdash;I'll need you to advise me on the roof
  of the building! And the ole deal will fall through, and there'll be nothing
  for us but to go on ahead to Maine. I&mdash;Paul, when it comes right down to
  it, I don't care whether you bust loose or not. I do like having a rep for
  being one of the Bunch, but if you ever needed me I'd chuck it and come out
  for you every time! Not of course but what you're&mdash;course I don't mean
  you'd ever do anything that would put&mdash;that would put a decent position
  on the fritz but&mdash;See how I mean? I'm kind of a clumsy old codger, and I
  need your fine Eyetalian hand. We&mdash;Oh, hell, I can't stand here gassing
  all day! On the job! S' long! Don't take any wooden money, Paulibus! See you
  soon! S' long!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">He forgot Paul Riesling in an afternoon of not unagreeable
  details. After a return to his office, which seemed to have staggered on
  without him, he drove a "prospect" out to view a four-flat tenement in the
  Linton district. He was inspired by the customer's admiration of the new
  cigar-lighter. Thrice its novelty made him use it, and thrice he hurled
  half-smoked cigarettes from the car, protesting, "I <i>got</i> to quit
  smoking so blame much!"</p>

  <p>Their ample discussion of every detail of the cigar-lighter led them to
  speak of electric flat-irons and bed-warmers. Babbitt apologized for being so
  shabbily old-fashioned as still to use a hot-water bottle, and he announced
  that he would have the sleeping-porch wired at once. He had enormous and
  poetic admiration, though very little understanding, of all mechanical
  devices. They were his symbols of truth and beauty. Regarding each new
  intricate mechanism&mdash;metal lathe, two-jet carburetor, machine gun,
  oxyacetylene welder&mdash;he learned one good realistic-sounding phrase, and
  used it over and over, with a delightful feeling of being technical and
  initiated.</p>

  <p>The customer joined him in the worship of machinery, and they came
  buoyantly up to the tenement and began that examination of plastic slate
  roof, kalamein doors, and seven-eighths-inch blind-nailed flooring, began
  those diplomacies of hurt surprise and readiness to be persuaded to do
  something they had already decided to do, which would some day result in a
  sale.</p>

  <p>On the way back Babbitt picked up his partner and father-in-law, Henry T.
  Thompson, at his kitchen-cabinet works, and they drove through South Zenith,
  a high-colored, banging, exciting region: new factories of hollow tile with
  gigantic wire-glass windows, surly old red-brick factories stained with tar,
  high-perched water-tanks, big red trucks like locomotives, and, on a score of
  hectic side-tracks, far-wandering freight-cars from the New York Central and
  apple orchards, the Great Northern and wheat-plateaus, the Southern Pacific
  and orange groves.</p>

  <p>They talked to the secretary of the Zenith Foundry Company about an
  interesting artistic project&mdash;a cast-iron fence for Linden Lane
  Cemetery. They drove on to the Zeeco Motor Company and interviewed the
  sales-manager, Noel Ryland, about a discount on a Zeeco car for Thompson.
  Babbitt and Ryland were fellow-members of the Boosters' Club, and no Booster
  felt right if he bought anything from another Booster without receiving a
  discount. But Henry Thompson growled, "Oh, t' hell with 'em! I'm not going to
  crawl around mooching discounts, not from nobody." It was one of the
  differences between Thompson, the old-fashioned, lean Yankee, rugged,
  traditional, stage type of American business man, and Babbitt, the plump,
  smooth, efficient, up-to-the-minute and otherwise perfected modern. Whenever
  Thompson twanged, "Put your John Hancock on that line," Babbitt was as much
  amused by the antiquated provincialism as any proper Englishman by any
  American. He knew himself to be of a breeding altogether more esthetic and
  sensitive than Thompson's. He was a college graduate, he played golf, he
  often smoked cigarettes instead of cigars, and when he went to Chicago he
  took a room with a private bath. "The whole thing is," he explained to Paul
  Riesling, "these old codgers lack the subtlety that you got to have
  to-day."</p>

  <p>This advance in civilization could be carried too far, Babbitt perceived.
  Noel Ryland, sales-manager of the Zeeco, was a frivolous graduate of
  Princeton, while Babbitt was a sound and standard ware from that great
  department-store, the State University. Ryland wore spats, he wrote long
  letters about City Planning and Community Singing, and, though he was a
  Booster, he was known to carry in his pocket small volumes of poetry in a
  foreign language. All this was going too far. Henry Thompson was the extreme
  of insularity, and Noel Ryland the extreme of frothiness, while between them,
  supporting the state, defending the evangelical churches and domestic
  brightness and sound business, were Babbitt and his friends.</p>

  <p>With this just estimate of himself&mdash;and with the promise of a
  discount on Thompson's car&mdash;he returned to his office in triumph.</p>

  <p>But as he went through the corridor of the Reeves Building he sighed,
  "Poor old Paul! I got to&mdash;Oh, damn Noel Ryland! Damn Charley McKelvey!
  Just because they make more money than I do, they think they're so superior.
  I wouldn't be found dead in their stuffy old Union Club! I&mdash;Somehow,
  to-day, I don't feel like going back to work. Oh well&mdash;"</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">He answered telephone calls, he read the four o'clock mail,
  he signed his morning's letters, he talked to a tenant about repairs, he
  fought with Stanley Graff.</p>

  <p>Young Graff, the outside salesman, was always hinting that he deserved an
  increase of commission, and to-day he complained, "I think I ought to get a
  bonus if I put through the Heiler sale. I'm chasing around and working on it
  every single evening, almost."</p>

  <p>Babbitt frequently remarked to his wife that it was better to "con your
  office-help along and keep 'em happy 'stead of jumping on 'em and poking 'em
  up&mdash;get more work out of 'em that way," but this unexampled lack of
  appreciation hurt him, and he turned on Graff:</p>

  <p>"Look here, Stan; let's get this clear. You've got an idea somehow that
  it's you that do all the selling. Where d' you get that stuff? Where d' you
  think you'd be if it wasn't for our capital behind you, and our lists of
  properties, and all the prospects we find for you? All you got to do is
  follow up our tips and close the deal. The hall-porter could sell
  Babbitt-Thompson listings! You say you're engaged to a girl, but have to put
  in your evenings chasing after buyers. Well, why the devil shouldn't you?
  What do you want to do? Sit around holding her hand? Let me tell you, Stan,
  if your girl is worth her salt, she'll be glad to know you're out hustling,
  making some money to furnish the home-nest, instead of doing the lovey-dovey.
  The kind of fellow that kicks about working overtime, that wants to spend his
  evenings reading trashy novels or spooning and exchanging a lot of nonsense
  and foolishness with some girl, he ain't the kind of upstanding, energetic
  young man, with a future&mdash;and with Vision!&mdash;that we want here. How
  about it? What's your Ideal, anyway? Do you want to make money and be a
  responsible member of the community, or do you want to be a loafer, with no
  Inspiration or Pep?"</p>

  <p>Graff was not so amenable to Vision and Ideals as usual. "You bet I want
  to make money! That's why I want that bonus! Honest, Mr. Babbitt, I don't
  want to get fresh, but this Heiler house is a terror. Nobody'll fall for it.
  The flooring is rotten and the walls are full of cracks."</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what I mean! To a salesman with a love for his profession,
  it's hard problems like that that inspire him to do his best. Besides,
  Stan&mdash;Matter o' fact, Thompson and I are against bonuses, as a matter of
  principle. We like you, and we want to help you so you can get married, but
  we can't be unfair to the others on the staff. If we start giving you
  bonuses, don't you see we're going to hurt the feeling and be unjust to
  Penniman and Laylock? Right's right, and discrimination is unfair, and there
  ain't going to be any of it in this office! Don't get the idea, Stan, that
  because during the war salesmen were hard to hire, now, when there's a lot of
  men out of work, there aren't a slew of bright young fellows that would be
  glad to step in and enjoy your opportunities, and not act as if Thompson and
  I were his enemies and not do any work except for bonuses. How about it, heh?
  How about it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;gee&mdash;of course&mdash;" sighed Graff, as he went
  out, crabwise.</p>

  <p>Babbitt did not often squabble with his employees. He liked to like the
  people about him; he was dismayed when they did not like him. It was only
  when they attacked the sacred purse that he was frightened into fury, but
  then, being a man given to oratory and high principles, he enjoyed the sound
  of his own vocabulary and the warmth of his own virtue. Today he had so
  passionately indulged in self-approval that he wondered whether he had been
  entirely just:</p>

  <p>"After all, Stan isn't a boy any more. Oughtn't to call him so hard. But
  rats, got to haul folks over the coals now and then for their own good.
  Unpleasant duty, but&mdash;I wonder if Stan is sore? What's he saying to
  McGoun out there?"</p>

  <p>So chill a wind of hatred blew from the outer office that the normal
  comfort of his evening home-going was ruined. He was distressed by losing
  that approval of his employees to which an executive is always slave.
  Ordinarily he left the office with a thousand enjoyable fussy directions to
  the effect that there would undoubtedly be important tasks to-morrow, and
  Miss McGoun and Miss Bannigan would do well to be there early, and for
  heaven's sake remind him to call up Conrad Lyte soon 's he came in. To-night
  he departed with feigned and apologetic liveliness. He was as afraid of his
  still-faced clerks&mdash;of the eyes focused on him, Miss McGoun staring with
  head lifted from her typing, Miss Bannigan looking over her ledger, Mat
  Penniman craning around at his desk in the dark alcove, Stanley Graff
  sullenly expressionless&mdash;as a parvenu before the bleak propriety of his
  butler. He hated to expose his back to their laughter, and in his effort to
  be casually merry he stammered and was raucously friendly and oozed
  wretchedly out of the door.</p>

  <p>But he forgot his misery when he saw from Smith Street the charms of
  Floral Heights; the roofs of red tile and green slate, the shining new
  sun-parlors, and the stainless walls.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">He stopped to inform Howard Littlefield, his scholarly
  neighbor, that though the day had been springlike the evening might be cold.
  He went in to shout "Where are you?" at his wife, with no very definite
  desire to know where she was. He examined the lawn to see whether the
  furnace-man had raked it properly. With some satisfaction and a good deal of
  discussion of the matter with Mrs. Babbitt, Ted, and Howard Littlefield, he
  concluded that the furnace-man had not raked it properly. He cut two tufts of
  wild grass with his wife's largest dressmaking-scissors; he informed Ted that
  it was all nonsense having a furnace-man&mdash;"big husky fellow like you
  ought to do all the work around the house;" and privately he meditated that
  it was agreeable to have it known throughout the neighborhood that he was so
  prosperous that his son never worked around the house.</p>

  <p>He stood on the sleeping-porch and did his day's exercises: arms out
  sidewise for two minutes, up for two minutes, while he muttered, "Ought take
  more exercise; keep in shape;" then went in to see whether his collar needed
  changing before dinner. As usual it apparently did not.</p>

  <p>The Lettish-Croat maid, a powerful woman, beat the dinner-gong.</p>

  <p>The roast of beef, roasted potatoes, and string beans were excellent this
  evening and, after an adequate sketch of the day's progressive
  weather-states, his four-hundred-and-fifty-dollar fee, his lunch with Paul
  Riesling, and the proven merits of the new cigar-lighter, he was moved to a
  benign, "Sort o' thinking about buyin, a new car. Don't believe we'll get one
  till next year, but still we might."</p>

  <p>Verona, the older daughter, cried, "Oh, Dad, if you do, why don't you get
  a sedan? That would be perfectly slick! A closed car is so much more comfy
  than an open one."</p>

  <p>"Well now, I don't know about that. I kind of like an open car. You get
  more fresh air that way."</p>

  <p>"Oh, shoot, that's just because you never tried a sedan. Let's get one.
  It's got a lot more class," said Ted.</p>

  <p>"A closed car does keep the clothes nicer," from Mrs. Babbitt; "You don't
  get your hair blown all to pieces," from Verona; "It's a lot sportier," from
  Ted; and from Tinka, the youngest, "Oh, let's have a sedan! Mary Ellen's
  father has got one." Ted wound up, "Oh, everybody's got a closed car now,
  except us!"</p>

  <p>Babbitt faced them: "I guess you got nothing very terrible to complain
  about! Anyway, I don't keep a car just to enable you children to look like
  millionaires! And I like an open car, so you can put the top down on summer
  evenings and go out for a drive and get some good fresh air. Besides&mdash;A
  closed car costs more money."</p>

  <p>"Aw, gee whiz, if the Doppelbraus can afford a closed car, I guess we
  can!" prodded Ted.</p>

  <p>"Humph! I make eight thousand a year to his seven! But I don't blow it all
  in and waste it and throw it around, the way he does! Don't believe in this
  business of going and spending a whole lot of money to show off
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They went, with ardor and some thoroughness, into the matters of
  streamline bodies, hill-climbing power, wire wheels, chrome steel, ignition
  systems, and body colors. It was much more than a study of transportation. It
  was an aspiration for knightly rank. In the city of Zenith, in the barbarous
  twentieth century, a family's motor indicated its social rank as precisely as
  the grades of the peerage determined the rank of an English
  family&mdash;indeed, more precisely, considering the opinion of old county
  families upon newly created brewery barons and woolen-mill viscounts. The
  details of precedence were never officially determined. There was no court to
  decide whether the second son of a Pierce Arrow limousine should go in to
  dinner before the first son of a Buick roadster, but of their respective
  social importance there was no doubt; and where Babbitt as a boy had aspired
  to the presidency, his son Ted aspired to a Packard twin-six and an
  established position in the motored gentry.</p>

  <p>The favor which Babbitt had won from his family by speaking of a new car
  evaporated as they realized that he didn't intend to buy one this year. Ted
  lamented, "Oh, punk! The old boat looks as if it'd had fleas and been
  scratching its varnish off." Mrs. Babbitt said abstractedly, "Snoway talkcher
  father." Babbitt raged, "If you're too much of a high-class gentleman, and
  you belong to the bon ton and so on, why, you needn't take the car out this
  evening." Ted explained, "I didn't mean&mdash;" and dinner dragged on with
  normal domestic delight to the inevitable point at which Babbitt protested,
  "Come, come now, we can't sit here all evening. Give the girl a chance to
  clear away the table."</p>

  <p>He was fretting, "What a family! I don't know how we all get to scrapping
  this way. Like to go off some place and be able to hear myself
  think...Paul...Maine...Wear old pants, and loaf, and cuss." He said
  cautiously to his wife, "I've been in correspondence with a man in New
  York&mdash;wants me to see him about a real-estate trade&mdash;may not come
  off till summer. Hope it doesn't break just when we and the Rieslings get
  ready to go to Maine. Be a shame if we couldn't make the trip there together.
  Well, no use worrying now."</p>

  <p>Verona escaped, immediately after dinner, with no discussion save an
  automatic "Why don't you ever stay home?" from Babbitt.</p>

  <p>In the living-room, in a corner of the davenport, Ted settled down to his
  Home Study; plain geometry, Cicero, and the agonizing metaphors of Comus.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why they give us this old-fashioned junk by Milton and
  Shakespeare and Wordsworth and all these has-beens," he protested. "Oh, I
  guess I could stand it to see a show by Shakespeare, if they had swell
  scenery and put on a lot of dog, but to sit down in cold blood and
  <i>read</i> 'em&mdash;These teachers&mdash;how do they get that way?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Babbitt, darning socks, speculated, "Yes, I wonder why. Of course I
  don't want to fly in the face of the professors and everybody, but I do think
  there's things in Shakespeare&mdash;not that I read him much, but when I was
  young the girls used to show me passages that weren't, really, they weren't
  at all nice."</p>

  <p>Babbitt looked up irritably from the comic strips in the <i>Evening
  Advocate</i>. They composed his favorite literature and art, these
  illustrated chronicles in which Mr. Mutt hit Mr. Jeff with a rotten egg, and
  Mother corrected Father's vulgarisms by means of a rolling-pin. With the
  solemn face of a devotee, breathing heavily through his open mouth, he
  plodded nightly through every picture, and during the rite he detested
  interruptions. Furthermore, he felt that on the subject of Shakespeare he
  wasn't really an authority. Neither the <i>Advocate-Times</i>, the <i>Evening
  Advocate</i>, nor the <i>Bulletin of the Zenith Chamber of Commerce</i> had
  ever had an editorial on the matter, and until one of them had spoken he
  found it hard to form an original opinion. But even at risk of floundering in
  strange bogs, he could not keep out of an open controversy.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you why you have to study Shakespeare and those. It's because
  they're required for college entrance, and that's all there is to it!
  Personally, I don't see myself why they stuck 'em into an up-to-date
  high-school system like we have in this state. Be a good deal better if you
  took Business English, and learned how to write an ad, or letters that would
  pull. But there it is, and there's no tall, argument, or discussion about it!
  Trouble with you, Ted, is you always want to do something different! If
  you're going to law-school&mdash;and you are!&mdash;I never had a chance to,
  but I'll see that you do&mdash;why, you'll want to lay in all the English and
  Latin you can get."</p>

  <p>"Oh punk. I don't see what's the use of law-school&mdash;or even finishing
  high school. I don't want to go to college 'specially. Honest, there's lot of
  fellows that have graduated from colleges that don't begin to make as much
  money as fellows that went to work early. Old Shimmy Peters, that teaches
  Latin in the High, he's a what-is-it from Columbia and he sits up all night
  reading a lot of greasy books and he's always spieling about the 'value of
  languages,' and the poor soak doesn't make but eighteen hundred a year, and
  no traveling salesman would think of working for that. I know what I'd like
  to do. I'd like to be an aviator, or own a corking big garage, or
  else&mdash;a fellow was telling me about it yesterday&mdash;I'd like to be
  one of these fellows that the Standard Oil Company sends out to China, and
  you live in a compound and don't have to do any work, and you get to see the
  world and pagodas and the ocean and everything! And then I could take up
  correspondence-courses. That's the real stuff! You don't have to recite to
  some frosty-faced old dame that's trying to show off to the principal, and
  you can study any subject you want to. Just listen to these! I clipped out
  the ads of some swell courses."</p>

  <p>He snatched from the back of his geometry half a hundred advertisements of
  those home-study courses which the energy and foresight of American commerce
  have contributed to the science of education. The first displayed the
  portrait of a young man with a pure brow, an iron jaw, silk socks, and hair
  like patent leather. Standing with one hand in his trousers-pocket and the
  other extended with chiding forefinger, he was bewitching an audience of men
  with gray beards, paunches, bald heads, and every other sign of wisdom and
  prosperity. Above the picture was an inspiring educational symbol&mdash;no
  antiquated lamp or torch or owl of Minerva, but a row of dollar signs. The
  text ran:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Who do you think I ran into the other evening at the De Luxe
  Restaurant? Why, old Freddy Durkee, that used to be a dead or-alive shipping
  clerk in my old place&mdash;Mr. Mouse-Man we used to laughingly call the dear
  fellow. One time he was so timid he was plumb scared of the Super, and never
  got credit for the dandy work he did. Him at the De Luxe! And if he wasn't
  ordering a tony feed with all the 'fixings' from celery to nuts! And instead
  of being embarrassed by the waiters, like he used to be at the little dump
  where we lunched in Old Lang Syne, he was bossing them around like he was a
  millionaire!</p>

  <p class="quote">I cautiously asked him what he was doing. Freddy laughed and
  said, 'Say, old chum, I guess you're wondering what's come over me. You'll be

  <p class="quote">"Here's how it happened. I ran across an ad of a course that
  claimed to teach people how to talk easily and on their feet, how to answer
  complaints, how to lay a proposition before the Boss, how to hit a bank for a
  loan, how to hold a big audience spellbound with wit, humor, anecdote,
  inspiration, etc. It was compiled by the Master Orator, Prof. Waldo F. Peet.
  I was skeptical, too, but I wrote (<i>just on a postcard</i>, with name and
  address) to the publisher for the lessons&mdash;sent On Trial, money back if
  you are not absolutely satisfied. There were eight simple lessons in plain
  language anybody could understand, and I studied them just a few hours a
  night, then started practising on the wife. Soon found I could talk right up
  to the Super and get due credit for all the good work I did. They began to
  appreciate me and advance me fast, and say, old doggo, what do you think
  they're paying me now? $6,500 per year! And say, I find I can keep a big
  audience fascinated, speaking on any topic. As a friend, old boy, I advise
  you to send for circular (no obligation) and valuable free Art Picture

  Babbitt was again without a canon which would enable him to speak with
  authority. Nothing in motoring or real estate had indicated what a Solid
  Citizen and Regular Fellow ought to think about culture by mail. He began
  with hesitation:</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;sounds as if it covered the ground. It certainly is a fine
  thing to be able to orate. I've sometimes thought I had a little talent that
  way myself, and I know darn well that one reason why a fourflushing old
  back-number like Chan Mott can get away with it in real estate is just
  because he can make a good talk, even when he hasn't got a doggone thing to
  say! And it certainly is pretty cute the way they get out all these courses
  on various topics and subjects nowadays. I'll tell you, though: No need to
  blow in a lot of good money on this stuff when you can get a first-rate
  course in eloquence and English and all that right in your own
  school&mdash;and one of the biggest school buildings in the entire
  country!"</p>

  <p>"That's so," said Mrs. Babbitt comfortably, while Ted complained:</p>

  <p>"Yuh, but Dad, they just teach a lot of old junk that isn't any practical
  use&mdash;except the manual training and typewriting and basketball and
  dancing&mdash;and in these correspondence-courses, gee, you can get all kinds
  of stuff that would come in handy. Say, listen to this one:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">'CAN YOU PLAY A MAN'S PART?</p>

  <p class="quote">'If you are walking with your mother, sister or best girl
  and some one passes a slighting remark or uses improper language, won't you
  be ashamed if you can't take her part? Well, can you?</p>

  <p class="quote">'We teach boxing and self-defense by mail. Many pupils have
  written saying that after a few lessons they've outboxed bigger and heavier
  opponents. The lessons start with simple movements practised before your
  mirror&mdash;holding out your hand for a coin, the breast-stroke in swimming,
  etc. Before you realize it you are striking scientifically, ducking, guarding
  and feinting, just as if you had a real opponent before you.'</p><br>

  <p>"Oh, baby, maybe I wouldn't like that!" Ted chanted. "I'll tell the world!
  Gosh, I'd like to take one fellow I know in school that's always shooting off
  his mouth, and catch him alone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! The idea! Most useless thing I ever heard of!" Babbitt
  fulminated.</p>

  <p>"Well, just suppose I was walking with Mama or Rone, and somebody passed a
  slighting remark or used improper language. What would I do?"</p>

  <p>"Why, you'd probably bust the record for the hundred-yard dash!"</p>

  <p>"I <i>would</i> not! I'd stand right up to any mucker that passed a
  slighting remark on <i>my</i> sister and I'd show him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look here, young Dempsey! If I ever catch you fighting I'll whale the
  everlasting daylights out of you&mdash;and I'll do it without practising
  holding out my hand for a coin before the mirror, too!"</p>

  <p>"Why, Ted dear," Mrs. Babbitt said placidly, "it's not at all nice, your
  talking of fighting this way!"</p>

  <p>"Well, gosh almighty, that's a fine way to appreciate&mdash;And then
  suppose I was walking with <i>you</i>, Ma, and somebody passed a slighting
  remark&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nobody's going to pass no slighting remarks on nobody," Babbitt observed,
  "not if they stay home and study their geometry and mind their own affairs
  instead of hanging around a lot of poolrooms and soda-fountains and places
  where nobody's got any business to be!"</p>

  <p>"But gooooooosh, Dad, if they DID!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Babbitt chirped, "Well, if they did, I wouldn't do them the honor of
  paying any attention to them! Besides, they never do. You always hear about
  these women that get followed and insulted and all, but I don't believe a
  word of it, or it's their own fault, the way some women look at a person. I
  certainly never 've been insulted by&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw shoot. Mother, just suppose you <i>were</i> sometime! Just
  <i>suppose</i>! Can't you suppose something? Can't you imagine things?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly I can imagine things! The idea!"</p>

  <p>"Certainly your mother can imagine things&mdash;and suppose things! Think
  you're the only member of this household that's got an imagination?" Babbitt
  demanded. "But what's the use of a lot of supposing? Supposing never gets you
  anywhere. No sense supposing when there's a lot of real facts to take into
  considera&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look here, Dad. Suppose&mdash;I mean, just&mdash;just suppose you were in
  your office and some rival real-estate man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Realtor!"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;some realtor that you hated came in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't hate any realtor."</p>

  <p>"But suppose you <i>did</i>!"</p>

  <p>"I don't intend to suppose anything of the kind! There's plenty of fellows
  in my profession that stoop and hate their competitors, but if you were a
  little older and understood business, instead of always going to the movies
  and running around with a lot of fool girls with their dresses up to their
  knees and powdered and painted and rouged and God knows what all as if they
  were chorus-girls, then you'd know&mdash;and you'd suppose&mdash;that if
  there's any one thing that I stand for in the real-estate circles of Zenith,
  it is that we ought to always speak of each other only in the friendliest
  terms and institute a spirit of brotherhood and cooperation, and so I
  certainly can't suppose and I can't imagine my hating any realtor, not even
  that dirty, fourflushing society sneak, Cecil Rountree!"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And there's no If, And or But about it! But if I <i>were</i> going to
  lambaste somebody, I wouldn't require any fancy ducks or swimming-strokes
  before a mirror, or any of these doodads and flipflops! Suppose you were out
  some place and a fellow called you vile names. Think you'd want to box and
  jump around like a dancing-master? You'd just lay him out cold (at least I
  certainly hope any son of mine would!) and then you'd dust off your hands and
  go on about your business, and that's all there is to it, and you aren't
  going to have any boxing-lessons by mail, either!"</p>

  <p>"Well but&mdash;Yes&mdash;I just wanted to show how many different kinds
  of correspondence-courses there are, instead of all the camembert they teach
  us in the High."</p>

  <p>"But I thought they taught boxing in the school gymnasium."</p>

  <p>"That's different. They stick you up there and some big stiff amuses
  himself pounding the stuffin's out of you before you have a chance to learn.
  Hunka! Not any! But anyway&mdash;Listen to some of these others."</p>

  <p>The advertisements were truly philanthropic. One of them bore the rousing
  headline: "Money! Money!! Money!!!" The second announced that "Mr. P. R.,
  formerly making only eighteen a week in a barber shop, writes to us that
  since taking our course he is now pulling down $5,000 as an Osteo-vitalic
  Physician;" and the third that "Miss J. L., recently a wrapper in a store, is
  now getting Ten Real Dollars a day teaching our Hindu System of Vibratory
  Breathing and Mental Control."</p>

  <p>Ted had collected fifty or sixty announcements, from annual
  reference-books, from Sunday School periodicals, fiction-magazines, and
  journals of discussion. One benefactor implored, "Don't be a
  Wallflower&mdash;Be More Popular and Make More Money&mdash;<i>You</i> Can
  Ukulele or Sing Yourself into Society! By the secret principles of a Newly
  Discovered System of Music Teaching, any one&mdash;man, lady or
  child&mdash;can, without tiresome exercises, special training or long drawn
  out study, and without waste of time, money or energy, learn to play by note,
  piano, banjo, cornet, clarinet, saxophone, violin or drum, and learn
  sight-singing."</p>

  <p>The next, under the wistful appeal "Finger Print Detectives
  Wanted&mdash;Big Incomes!" confided: "<i>You</i> red-blooded men and
  women&mdash;this is the <i>profession</i> you have been looking for. There's
  <i>money</i> in it, <i>big</i> money, and that rapid change of scene, that
  entrancing and compelling interest and fascination, which your active mind
  and adventurous spirit crave. Think of being the chief figure and directing
  factor in solving strange mysteries and baffling crimes. This wonderful
  profession brings you into contact with influential men on the basis of
  equality, and often calls upon you to travel everywhere, maybe to distant
  lands&mdash;all expenses paid. NO SPECIAL EDUCATION REQUIRED."</p>

  <p>"Oh, boy! I guess that wins the fire-brick necklace! Wouldn't it be swell
  to travel everywhere and nab some famous crook!" whooped Ted.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't think much of that. Doggone likely to get hurt. Still, that
  music-study stunt might be pretty fair, though. There's no reason why, if
  efficiency-experts put their minds to it the way they have to routing
  products in a factory, they couldn't figure out some scheme so a person
  wouldn't have to monkey with all this practising and exercises that you get
  in music." Babbitt was impressed, and he had a delightful parental feeling
  that they two, the men of the family, understood each other.</p>

  <p>He listened to the notices of mail-box universities which taught
  Short-story Writing and Improving the Memory, Motion-picture-acting and
  Developing the Soul-power, Banking and Spanish, Chiropody and Photography,
  Electrical Engineering and Window-trimming, Poultry-raising and
  Chemistry.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;" Babbitt sought for adequate expression of his
  admiration. "I'm a son of a gun! I knew this correspondence-school business
  had become a mighty profitable game&mdash;makes suburban real-estate look
  like two cents!&mdash;but I didn't realize it'd got to be such a reg'lar
  key-industry! Must rank right up with groceries and movies. Always figured
  somebody'd come along with the brains to not leave education to a lot of
  bookworms and impractical theorists but make a big thing out of it. Yes, I
  can see how a lot of these courses might interest you. I must ask the fellows
  at the Athletic if they ever realized&mdash;But same time, Ted, you know how
  advertisers, I means some advertisers, exaggerate. I don't know as they'd be
  able to jam you through these courses as fast as they claim they can."</p>

  <p>"Oh sure, Dad; of course." Ted had the immense and joyful maturity of a
  boy who is respectfully listened to by his elders. Babbitt concentrated on
  him with grateful affection:</p>

  <p>"I can see what an influence these courses might have on the whole
  educational works. Course I'd never admit it publicly&mdash;fellow like
  myself, a State U. graduate, it's only decent and patriotic for him to blow
  his horn and boost the Alma Mater&mdash;but smatter of fact, there's a whole
  lot of valuable time lost even at the U., studying poetry and French and
  subjects that never brought in anybody a cent. I don't know but what maybe
  these correspondence-courses might prove to be one of the most important
  American inventions.</p>

  <p>"Trouble with a lot of folks is: they're so blame material; they don't see
  the spiritual and mental side of American supremacy; they think that
  inventions like the telephone and the areoplane and wireless&mdash;no, that
  was a Wop invention, but anyway: they think these mechanical improvements are
  all that we stand for; whereas to a real thinker, he sees that spiritual and,
  uh, dominating movements like Efficiency, and Rotarianism, and Prohibition,
  and Democracy are what compose our deepest and truest wealth. And maybe this
  new principle in education-at-home may be another&mdash;may be another
  factor. I tell you, Ted, we've got to have Vision&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think those correspondence-courses are terrible!"</p>

  <p>The philosophers gasped. It was Mrs. Babbitt who had made this discord in
  their spiritual harmony, and one of Mrs. Babbitt's virtues was that, except
  during dinner-parties, when she was transformed into a raging hostess, she
  took care of the house and didn't bother the males by thinking. She went on
  firmly:</p>

  <p>"It sounds awful to me, the way they coax those poor young folks to think
  they're learning something, and nobody 'round to help them and&mdash;You two
  learn so quick, but me, I always was slow. But just the same&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Babbitt attended to her: "Nonsense! Get just as much, studying at home.
  You don't think a fellow learns any more because he blows in his father's
  hard-earned money and sits around in Morris chairs in a swell Harvard
  dormitory with pictures and shields and table-covers and those doodads, do
  you? I tell you, I'm a college man&mdash;I <i>know</i>! There is one
  objection you might make though. I certainly do protest against any effort to
  get a lot of fellows out of barber shops and factories into the professions.
  They're too crowded already, and what'll we do for workmen if all those
  fellows go and get educated?"</p>

  <p>Ted was leaning back, smoking a cigarette without reproof. He was, for the
  moment, sharing the high thin air of Babbitt's speculation as though he were
  Paul Riesling or even Dr. Howard Littlefield. He hinted:</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think then, Dad? Wouldn't it be a good idea if I could
  go off to China or some peppy place, and study engineering or something by
  mail?"</p>

  <p>"No, and I'll tell you why, son. I've found out it's a mighty nice thing
  to be able to say you're a B.A. Some client that doesn't know what you are
  and thinks you're just a plug business man, he gets to shooting off his mouth
  about economics or literature or foreign trade conditions, and you just ease
  in something like, 'When I was in college&mdash;course I got my B.A. in
  sociology and all that junk&mdash;' Oh, it puts an awful crimp in their
  style! But there wouldn't be any class to saying 'I got the degree of
  Stamp-licker from the Bezuzus Mail-order University!' You see&mdash;My dad
  was a pretty good old coot, but he never had much style to him, and I had to
  work darn hard to earn my way through college. Well, it's been worth it, to
  be able to associate with the finest gentlemen in Zenith, at the clubs and so
  on, and I wouldn't want you to drop out of the gentlemen class&mdash;the
  class that are just as red-blooded as the Common People but still have power
  and personality. It would kind of hurt me if you did that, old man!"</p>

  <p>"I know, Dad! Sure! All right. I'll stick to it. Say! Gosh! Gee whiz! I
  forgot all about those kids I was going to take to the chorus rehearsal. I'll
  have to duck!"</p>

  <p>"But you haven't done all your home-work."</p>

  <p>"Do it first thing in the morning."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Six times in the past sixty days Babbitt had stormed, "You will not 'do it
  first thing in the morning'! You'll do it right now!" but to-night he said,
  "Well, better hustle," and his smile was the rare shy radiance he kept for
  Paul Riesling.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">"Ted's a good boy," he said to Mrs. Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he is!"</p>

  <p>"Who's these girls he's going to pick up? Are they nice decent girls?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Oh dear, Ted never tells me anything any more. I don't
  understand what's come over the children of this generation. I used to have
  to tell Papa and Mama everything, but seems like the children to-day have
  just slipped away from all control."</p>

  <p>"I hope they're decent girls. Course Ted's no longer a kid, and I wouldn't
  want him to, uh, get mixed up and everything."</p>

  <p>"George: I wonder if you oughtn't to take him aside and tell him
  about&mdash;Things!" She blushed and lowered her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know. Way I figure it, Myra, no sense suggesting a lot of
  Things to a boy's mind. Think up enough devilment by himself. But I
  wonder&mdash;It's kind of a hard question. Wonder what Littlefield thinks
  about it?"</p>

  <p>"Course Papa agrees with you. He says all this&mdash;Instruction
  is&mdash;He says 'tisn't decent."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he does, does he! Well, let me tell you that whatever Henry T.
  Thompson thinks&mdash;about morals, I mean, though course you can't beat the
  old duffer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why, what a way to talk of Papa!"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;simply can't beat him at getting in on the ground floor of a deal,
  but let me tell you whenever he springs any ideas about higher things and
  education, then I know I think just the opposite. You may not regard me as
  any great brain-shark, but believe me, I'm a regular college president,
  compared with Henry T.! Yes sir, by golly, I'm going to take Ted aside and
  tell him why I lead a strictly moral life."</p>

  <p>"Oh, will you? When?"</p>

  <p>"When? When? What's the use of trying to pin me down to When and Why and
  Where and How and When? That's the trouble with women, that's why they don't
  make high-class executives; they haven't any sense of diplomacy. When the
  proper opportunity and occasion arises so it just comes in natural, why then
  I'll have a friendly little talk with him and&mdash;and&mdash;Was that Tinka
  hollering up-stairs? She ought to been asleep, long ago."</p>

  <p>He prowled through the living-room, and stood in the sun-parlor, that
  glass-walled room of wicker chairs and swinging couch in which they loafed on
  Sunday afternoons. Outside only the lights of Doppelbrau's house and the dim
  presence of Babbitt's favorite elm broke the softness of April night.</p>

  <p>"Good visit with the boy. Getting over feeling cranky, way I did this
  morning. And restless. Though, by golly, I will have a few days alone with
  Paul in Maine!...That devil Zilla!...But...Ted's all right. Whole family all
  right. And good business. Not many fellows make four hundred and fifty bucks,
  practically half of a thousand dollars easy as I did to-day! Maybe when we
  all get to rowing it's just as much my fault as it is theirs. Oughtn't to get
  grouchy like I do. But&mdash;Wish I'd been a pioneer, same as my grand-dad.
  But then, wouldn't have a house like this. I&mdash;Oh, gosh, I DON'T
  KNOW!"</p>

  <p>He thought moodily of Paul Riesling, of their youth together, of the girls
  they had known.</p>

  <p>When Babbitt had graduated from the State University, twenty-four years
  ago, he had intended to be a lawyer. He had been a ponderous debater in
  college; he felt that he was an orator; he saw himself becoming governor of
  the state. While he read law he worked as a real-estate salesman. He saved
  money, lived in a boarding-house, supped on poached egg on hash. The lively
  Paul Riesling (who was certainly going off to Europe to study violin, next
  month or next year) was his refuge till Paul was bespelled by Zilla Colbeck,
  who laughed and danced and drew men after her plump and gaily wagging
  finger.</p>

  <p>Babbitt's evenings were barren then, and he found comfort only in Paul's
  second cousin, Myra Thompson, a sleek and gentle girl who showed her capacity
  by agreeing with the ardent young Babbitt that of course he was going to be
  governor some day. Where Zilla mocked him as a country boy, Myra said
  indignantly that he was ever so much solider than the young dandies who had
  been born in the great city of Zenith&mdash;an ancient settlement in 1897,
  one hundred and five years old, with two hundred thousand population, the
  queen and wonder of all the state and, to the Catawba boy, George Babbitt, so
  vast and thunderous and luxurious that he was flattered to know a girl
  ennobled by birth in Zenith.</p>

  <p>Of love there was no talk between them. He knew that if he was to study
  law he could not marry for years; and Myra was distinctly a Nice
  Girl&mdash;one didn't kiss her, one didn't "think about her that way at all"
  unless one was going to marry her. But she was a dependable companion. She
  was always ready to go skating, walking; always content to hear his
  discourses on the great things he was going to do, the distressed poor whom
  he would defend against the Unjust Rich, the speeches he would make at
  Banquets, the inexactitudes of popular thought which he would correct.</p>

  <p>One evening when he was weary and soft-minded, he saw that she had been
  weeping. She had been left out of a party given by Zilla. Somehow her head
  was on his shoulder and he was kissing away the tears&mdash;and she raised
  her head to say trustingly, "Now that we're engaged, shall we be married soon
  or shall we wait?"</p>

  <p>Engaged? It was his first hint of it. His affection for this brown tender
  woman thing went cold and fearful, but he could not hurt her, could not abuse
  her trust. He mumbled something about waiting, and escaped. He walked for an
  hour, trying to find a way of telling her that it was a mistake. Often, in
  the month after, he got near to telling her, but it was pleasant to have a
  girl in his arms, and less and less could he insult her by blurting that he
  didn't love her. He himself had no doubt. The evening before his marriage was
  an agony, and the morning wild with the desire to flee.</p>

  <p>She made him what is known as a Good Wife. She was loyal, industrious, and
  at rare times merry. She passed from a feeble disgust at their closer
  relations into what promised to be ardent affection, but it drooped into
  bored routine. Yet she existed only for him and for the children, and she was
  as sorry, as worried as himself, when he gave up the law and trudged on in a
  rut of listing real estate.</p>

  <p>"Poor kid, she hasn't had much better time than I have," Babbitt
  reflected, standing in the dark sun-parlor. "But&mdash;I wish I could 've had
  a whirl at law and politics. Seen what I could do. Well&mdash;Maybe I've made
  more money as it is."</p>

  <p>He returned to the living-room but before he settled down he smoothed his
  wife's hair, and she glanced up, happy and somewhat surprised.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">He solemnly finished the last copy of the <i>American
  Magazine</i>, while his wife sighed, laid away her darning, and looked
  enviously at the lingerie designs in a women's magazine. The room was very
  still.</p>

  <p>It was a room which observed the best Floral Heights standards. The gray
  walls were divided into artificial paneling by strips of white-enameled pine.
  From the Babbitts' former house had come two much-carved rocking-chairs, but
  the other chairs were new, very deep and restful, upholstered in blue and
  gold-striped velvet. A blue velvet davenport faced the fireplace, and behind
  it was a cherrywood table and a tall piano-lamp with a shade of golden silk.
  (Two out of every three houses in Floral Heights had before the fireplace a
  davenport, a mahogany table real or imitation, and a piano-lamp or a
  reading-lamp with a shade of yellow or rose silk.)</p>

  <p>On the table was a runner of gold-threaded Chinese fabric, four magazines,
  a silver box containing cigarette-crumbs, and three "gift-books"&mdash;large,
  expensive editions of fairy-tales illustrated by English artists and as yet
  unread by any Babbitt save Tinka.</p>

  <p>In a corner by the front windows was a large cabinet Victrola. (Eight out
  of every nine Floral Heights houses had a cabinet phonograph.)</p>

  <p>Among the pictures, hung in the exact center of each gray panel, were a
  red and black imitation English hunting-print, an anemic imitation
  boudoir-print with a French caption of whose morality Babbitt had always been
  rather suspicious, and a "hand-colored" photograph of a Colonial
  room&mdash;rag rug, maiden spinning, cat demure before a white fireplace.
  (Nineteen out of every twenty houses in Floral Heights had either a
  hunting-print, a <i>Madame Feit la Toilette</i> print, a colored photograph
  of a New England house, a photograph of a Rocky Mountain, or all four.)</p>

  <p>It was a room as superior in comfort to the "parlor" of Babbitt's boyhood
  as his motor was superior to his father's buggy. Though there was nothing in
  the room that was interesting, there was nothing that was offensive. It was
  as neat, and as negative, as a block of artificial ice. The fireplace was
  unsoftened by downy ashes or by sooty brick; the brass fire-irons were of
  immaculate polish; and the grenadier andirons were like samples in a shop,
  desolate, unwanted, lifeless things of commerce.</p>

  <p>Against the wall was a piano, with another piano-lamp, but no one used it
  save Tinka. The hard briskness of the phonograph contented them; their store
  of jazz records made them feel wealthy and cultured; and all they knew of
  creating music was the nice adjustment of a bamboo needle. The books on the
  table were unspotted and laid in rigid parallels; not one corner of the
  carpet-rug was curled; and nowhere was there a hockey-stick, a torn
  picture-book, an old cap, or a gregarious and disorganizing dog.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">At home, Babbitt never read with absorption. He was
  concentrated enough at the office but here he crossed his legs and fidgeted.
  When his story was interesting he read the best, that is the funniest,
  paragraphs to his wife; when it did not hold him he coughed, scratched his
  ankles and his right ear, thrust his left thumb into his vest pocket, jingled
  his silver, whirled the cigar-cutter and the keys on one end of his watch
  chain, yawned, rubbed his nose, and found errands to do. He went upstairs to
  put on his slippers&mdash;his elegant slippers of seal-brown, shaped like
  medieval shoes. He brought up an apple from the barrel which stood by the
  trunk-closet in the basement.</p>

  <p>"An apple a day keeps the doctor away," he enlightened Mrs. Babbitt, for
  quite the first time in fourteen hours.</p>

  <p>"That's so."</p>

  <p>"An apple is Nature's best regulator."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Trouble with women is, they never have sense enough to form regular
  habits."</p>

  <p>"Well, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Always nibbling and eating between meals."</p>

  <p>"George!" She looked up from her reading. "Did you have a light lunch
  to-day, like you were going to? I did!"</p>

  <p>This malicious and unprovoked attack astounded him. "Well, maybe it wasn't
  as light as&mdash;Went to lunch with Paul and didn't have much chance to
  diet. Oh, you needn't to grin like a chessy cat! If it wasn't for me watching
  out and keeping an eye on our diet&mdash;I'm the only member of this family
  that appreciates the value of oatmeal for breakfast. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stooped over her story while he piously sliced and gulped down the
  apple, discoursing:</p>

  <p>"One thing I've done: cut down my smoking.</p>

  <p>"Had kind of a run-in with Graff in the office. He's getting too darn
  fresh. I'll stand for a good deal, but once in a while I got to assert my
  authority, and I jumped him. 'Stan,' I said&mdash;Well, I told him just
  exactly where he got off.</p>

  <p>"Funny kind of a day. Makes you feel restless.</p>

  <p>"Wellllllllll, uh&mdash;" That sleepiest sound in the world, the terminal
  yawn. Mrs. Babbitt yawned with it, and looked grateful as he droned, "How
  about going to bed, eh? Don't suppose Rone and Ted will be in till all hours.
  Yep, funny kind of a day; not terribly warm but yet&mdash;Gosh, I'd
  like&mdash;Some day I'm going to take a long motor trip."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we'd enjoy that," she yawned.</p>

  <p>He looked away from her as he realized that he did not wish to have her go
  with him. As he locked doors and tried windows and set the heat regulator so
  that the furnace-drafts would open automatically in the morning, he sighed a
  little, heavy with a lonely feeling which perplexed and frightened him. So
  absent-minded was he that he could not remember which window-catches he had
  inspected, and through the darkness, fumbling at unseen perilous chairs, he
  crept back to try them all over again. His feet were loud on the steps as he
  clumped upstairs at the end of this great and treacherous day of veiled
  rebellions.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Before breakfast he always reverted to up-state village
  boyhood, and shrank from the complex urban demands of shaving, bathing,
  deciding whether the current shirt was clean enough for another day. Whenever
  he stayed home in the evening he went to bed early, and thriftily got ahead
  in those dismal duties. It was his luxurious custom to shave while sitting
  snugly in a tubful of hot water. He may be viewed to-night as a plump,
  smooth, pink, baldish, podgy goodman, robbed of the importance of spectacles,
  squatting in breast-high water, scraping his lather-smeared cheeks with a
  safety-razor like a tiny lawn-mower, and with melancholy dignity clawing
  through the water to recover a slippery and active piece of soap.</p>

  <p>He was lulled to dreaming by the caressing warmth. The light fell on the
  inner surface of the tub in a pattern of delicate wrinkled lines which
  slipped with a green sparkle over the curving porcelain as the clear water
  trembled. Babbitt lazily watched it; noted that along the silhouette of his
  legs against the radiance on the bottom of the tub, the shadows of the
  air-bubbles clinging to the hairs were reproduced as strange jungle mosses.
  He patted the water, and the reflected light capsized and leaped and
  volleyed. He was content and childish. He played. He shaved a swath down the
  calf of one plump leg.</p>

  <p>The drain-pipe was dripping, a dulcet and lively song: drippety drip drip
  dribble, drippety drip drip drip. He was enchanted by it. He looked at the
  solid tub, the beautiful nickel taps, the tiled walls of the room, and felt
  virtuous in the possession of this splendor.</p>

  <p>He roused himself and spoke gruffly to his bath-things. "Come here! You've
  done enough fooling!" he reproved the treacherous soap, and defied the
  scratchy nail-brush with "Oh, you would, would you!" He soaped himself, and
  rinsed himself, and austerely rubbed himself; he noted a hole in the Turkish
  towel, and meditatively thrust a finger through it, and marched back to the
  bedroom, a grave and unbending citizen.</p>

  <p>There was a moment of gorgeous abandon, a flash of melodrama such as he
  found in traffic-driving, when he laid out a clean collar, discovered that it
  was frayed in front, and tore it up with a magnificent yeeeeeing sound.</p>

  <p>Most important of all was the preparation of his bed and the
  sleeping-porch.</p>

  <p>It is not known whether he enjoyed his sleeping-porch because of the fresh
  air or because it was the standard thing to have a sleeping-porch.</p>

  <p>Just as he was an Elk, a Booster, and a member of the Chamber of Commerce,
  just as the priests of the Presbyterian Church determined his every religious
  belief and the senators who controlled the Republican Party decided in little
  smoky rooms in Washington what he should think about disarmament, tariff, and
  Germany, so did the large national advertisers fix the surface of his life,
  fix what he believed to be his individuality. These standard advertised
  wares&mdash;toothpastes, socks, tires, cameras, instantaneous hot-water
  heaters&mdash;were his symbols and proofs of excellence; at first the signs,
  then the substitutes, for joy and passion and wisdom.</p>

  <p>But none of these advertised tokens of financial and social success was
  more significant than a sleeping-porch with a sun-parlor below.</p>

  <p>The rites of preparing for bed were elaborate and unchanging. The blankets
  had to be tucked in at the foot of his cot. (Also, the reason why the maid
  hadn't tucked in the blankets had to be discussed with Mrs. Babbitt.) The rag
  rug was adjusted so that his bare feet would strike it when he arose in the
  morning. The alarm clock was wound. The hot-water bottle was filled and
  placed precisely two feet from the bottom of the cot.</p>

  <p>These tremendous undertakings yielded to his determination; one by one
  they were announced to Mrs. Babbitt and smashed through to accomplishment. At
  last his brow cleared, and in his "Gnight!" rang virile power. But there was
  yet need of courage. As he sank into sleep, just at the first exquisite
  relaxation, the Doppelbrau car came home. He bounced into wakefulness,
  lamenting, "Why the devil can't some people never get to bed at a reasonable
  hour?" So familiar was he with the process of putting up his own car that he
  awaited each step like an able executioner condemned to his own rack.</p>

  <p>The car insultingly cheerful on the driveway. The car door opened and
  banged shut, then the garage door slid open, grating on the sill, and the car
  door again. The motor raced for the climb up into the garage and raced once
  more, explosively, before it was shut off. A final opening and slamming of
  the car door. Silence then, a horrible silence filled with waiting, till the
  leisurely Mr. Doppelbrau had examined the state of his tires and had at last
  shut the garage door. Instantly, for Babbitt, a blessed state of
  oblivion.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">At that moment In the city of Zenith, Horace Updike was
  making love to Lucile McKelvey in her mauve drawing-room on Royal Ridge,
  after their return from a lecture by an eminent English novelist. Updike was
  Zenith's professional bachelor; a slim-waisted man of forty-six with an
  effeminate voice and taste in flowers, cretonnes, and flappers. Mrs. McKelvey
  was red-haired, creamy, discontented, exquisite, rude, and honest. Updike
  tried his invariable first maneuver&mdash;touching her nervous wrist.</p>

  <p>"Don't be an idiot!" she said.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind awfully?"</p>

  <p>"No! That's what I mind!"</p>

  <p>He changed to conversation. He was famous at conversation. He spoke
  reasonably of psychoanalysis, Long Island polo, and the Ming platter he had
  found in Vancouver. She promised to meet him in Deauville, the coming summer,
  "though," she sighed, "it's becoming too dreadfully banal; nothing but
  Americans and frowsy English baronesses."</p>

  <p>And at that moment in Zenith, a cocaine-runner and a prostitute were
  drinking cocktails in Healey Hanson's saloon on Front Street. Since national
  prohibition was now in force, and since Zenith was notoriously law-abiding,
  they were compelled to keep the cocktails innocent by drinking them out of
  tea-cups. The lady threw her cup at the cocaine-runner's head. He worked his
  revolver out of the pocket in his sleeve, and casually murdered her.</p>

  <p>At that moment in Zenith, two men sat in a laboratory. For thirty-seven
  hours now they had been working on a report of their investigations of
  synthetic rubber.</p>

  <p>At that moment in Zenith, there was a conference of four union officials
  as to whether the twelve thousand coal-miners within a hundred miles of the
  city should strike. Of these men one resembled a testy and prosperous grocer,
  one a Yankee carpenter, one a soda-clerk, and one a Russian Jewish actor The
  Russian Jew quoted Kautsky, Gene Debs, and Abraham Lincoln.</p>

  <p>At that moment a G. A. R. veteran was dying. He had come from the Civil
  War straight to a farm which, though it was officially within the city-limits
  of Zenith, was primitive as the backwoods. He had never ridden in a motor
  car, never seen a bath-tub, never read any book save the Bible, McGuffey's
  readers, and religious tracts; and he believed that the earth is flat, that
  the English are the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel, and that the United States is
  a democracy.</p>

  <p>At that moment the steel and cement town which composed the factory of the
  Pullmore Tractor Company of Zenith was running on night shift to fill an
  order of tractors for the Polish army. It hummed like a million bees, glared
  through its wide windows like a volcano. Along the high wire fences,
  searchlights played on cinder-lined yards, switch-tracks, and armed guards on
  patrol.</p>

  <p>At that moment Mike Monday was finishing a meeting. Mr. Monday, the
  distinguished evangelist, the best-known Protestant pontiff in America, had
  once been a prize-fighter. Satan had not dealt justly with him. As a
  prize-fighter he gained nothing but his crooked nose, his celebrated
  vocabulary, and his stage-presence. The service of the Lord had been more
  profitable. He was about to retire with a fortune. It had been well earned,
  for, to quote his last report, "Rev. Mr. Monday, the Prophet with a Punch,
  has shown that he is the world's greatest salesman of salvation, and that by
  efficient organization the overhead of spiritual regeneration may be kept
  down to an unprecedented rock-bottom basis. He has converted over two hundred
  thousand lost and priceless souls at an average cost of less than ten dollars
  a head."</p>

  <p>Of the larger cities of the land, only Zenith had hesitated to submit its
  vices to Mike Monday and his expert reclamation corps. The more enterprising
  organizations of the city had voted to invite him&mdash;Mr. George F. Babbitt
  had once praised him in a speech at the Boosters' Club. But there was
  opposition from certain Episcopalian and Congregationalist ministers, those
  renegades whom Mr. Monday so finely called "a bunch of gospel-pushers with
  dish-water instead of blood, a gang of squealers that need more dust on the
  knees of their pants and more hair on their skinny old chests." This
  opposition had been crushed when the secretary of the Chamber of Commerce had
  reported to a committee of manufacturers that in every city where he had
  appeared, Mr. Monday had turned the minds of workmen from wages and hours to
  higher things, and thus averted strikes. He was immediately invited.</p>

  <p>An expense fund of forty thousand dollars had been underwritten; out on
  the County Fair Grounds a Mike Monday Tabernacle had been erected, to seat
  fifteen thousand people. In it the prophet was at this moment concluding his
  message:</p>

  <p>"There's a lot of smart college professors and tea-guzzling slobs in this
  burg that say I'm a roughneck and a never-wuzzer and my knowledge of history
  is not-yet. Oh, there's a gang of woolly-whiskered book-lice that think they
  know more than Almighty God, and prefer a lot of Hun science and smutty
  German criticism to the straight and simple Word of God. Oh, there's a swell
  bunch of Lizzie boys and lemon-suckers and pie-faces and infidels and
  beer-bloated scribblers that love to fire off their filthy mouths and yip
  that Mike Monday is vulgar and full of mush. Those pups are saying now that I
  hog the gospel-show, that I'm in it for the coin. Well, now listen, folks!
  I'm going to give those birds a chance! They can stand right up here and tell
  me to my face that I'm a galoot and a liar and a hick! Only if they
  do&mdash;if they do!&mdash;don't faint with surprise if some of those
  rum-dumm liars get one good swift poke from Mike, with all the kick of God's
  Flaming Righteousness behind the wallop! Well, come on, folks! Who says it?
  Who says Mike Monday is a fourflush and a yahoo? Huh? Don't I see anybody
  standing up? Well, there you are! Now I guess the folks in this man's town
  will quit listening to all this kyoodling from behind the fence; I guess
  you'll quit listening to the guys that pan and roast and kick and beef, and
  vomit out filthy atheism; and all of you 'll come in, with every grain of pep
  and reverence you got, and boost all together for Jesus Christ and his
  everlasting mercy and tenderness!"</p>

  <p class="first">At that moment Seneca Doane, the radical lawyer, and Dr.
  Kurt Yavitch, the histologist (whose report on the destruction of epithelial
  cells under radium had made the name of Zenith known in Munich, Prague, and
  Rome), were talking in Doane's library.</p>

  <p>"Zenith's a city with gigantic power&mdash;gigantic buildings, gigantic
  machines, gigantic transportation," meditated Doane.</p>

  <p>"I hate your city. It has standardized all the beauty out of life. It is
  one big railroad station&mdash;with all the people taking tickets for the
  best cemeteries," Dr. Yavitch said placidly.</p>

  <p>Doane roused. "I'm hanged if it is! You make me sick, Kurt, with your
  perpetual whine about 'standardization.' Don't you suppose any other nation
  is 'standardized?' Is anything more standardized than England, with every
  house that can afford it having the same muffins at the same tea-hour, and
  every retired general going to exactly the same evensong at the same gray
  stone church with a square tower, and every golfing prig in Harris tweeds
  saying 'Right you are!' to every other prosperous ass? Yet I love England.
  And for standardization&mdash;just look at the sidewalk cafes in France and
  the love-making in Italy!</p>

  <p>"Standardization is excellent, <i>per se</i>. When I buy an Ingersoll
  watch or a Ford, I get a better tool for less money, and I know precisely
  what I'm getting, and that leaves me more time and energy to be individual
  in. And&mdash;I remember once in London I saw a picture of an American
  suburb, in a toothpaste ad on the back of the <i>Saturday Evening
  Post</i>&mdash;an elm-lined snowy street of these new houses, Georgian some
  of 'em, or with low raking roofs and&mdash;The kind of street you'd find here
  in Zenith, say in Floral Heights. Open. Trees. Grass. And I was homesick!
  There's no other country in the world that has such pleasant houses. And I
  don't care if they <i>are</i> standardized. It's a corking standard!</p>

  <p>"No, what I fight in Zenith is standardization of thought, and, of course,
  the traditions of competition. The real villains of the piece are the clean,
  kind, industrious Family Men who use every known brand of trickery and
  cruelty to insure the prosperity of their cubs. The worst thing about these
  fellows is that they're so good and, in their work at least, so intelligent.
  You can't hate them properly, and yet their standardized minds are the
  enemy.</p>

  <p>"Then this boosting&mdash;Sneakingly I have a notion that Zenith is a
  better place to live in than Manchester or Glasgow or Lyons or Berlin or
  Turin&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is not, and I have lift in most of them," murmured Dr. Yavitch.</p>

  <p>"Well, matter of taste. Personally, I prefer a city with a future so
  unknown that it excites my imagination. But what I particularly
  want&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You," said Dr. Yavitch, "are a middle-road liberal, and you haven't the
  slightest idea what you want. I, being a revolutionist, know exactly what I
  want&mdash;and what I want now is a drink."</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">At that moment in Zenith, Jake Offutt, the politician, and
  Henry T. Thompson were in conference. Offutt suggested, "The thing to do is
  to get your fool son-in-law, Babbitt, to put it over. He's one of these
  patriotic guys. When he grabs a piece of property for the gang, he makes it
  look like we were dyin' of love for the dear peepul, and I do love to buy
  respectability&mdash;reasonable. Wonder how long we can keep it up, Hank?
  We're safe as long as the good little boys like George Babbitt and all the
  nice respectable labor-leaders think you and me are rugged patriots. There's
  swell pickings for an honest politician here, Hank: a whole city working to
  provide cigars and fried chicken and dry martinis for us, and rallying to our
  banner with indignation, oh, fierce indignation, whenever some squealer like
  this fellow Seneca Doane comes along! Honest, Hank, a smart codger like me
  ought to be ashamed of himself if he didn't milk cattle like them, when they
  come around mooing for it! But the Traction gang can't get away with grand
  larceny like it used to. I wonder when&mdash;Hank, I wish we could fix some
  way to run this fellow Seneca Doane out of town. It's him or us!"</p>

  <p>At that moment in Zenith, three hundred and forty or fifty thousand
  Ordinary People were asleep, a vast unpenetrated shadow. In the slum beyond
  the railroad tracks, a young man who for six months had sought work turned on
  the gas and killed himself and his wife.</p>

  <p>At that moment Lloyd Mallam, the poet, owner of the Hafiz Book Shop, was
  finishing a rondeau to show how diverting was life amid the feuds of medieval
  Florence, but how dull it was in so obvious a place as Zenith.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>And at that moment George F. Babbitt turned ponderously in bed&mdash;the
  last turn, signifying that he'd had enough of this worried business of
  falling asleep and was about it in earnest.</p>

  <p>Instantly he was in the magic dream. He was somewhere among unknown people
  who laughed at him. He slipped away, ran down the paths of a midnight garden,
  and at the gate the fairy child was waiting. Her dear and tranquil hand
  caressed his cheek. He was gallant and wise and well-beloved; warm ivory were
  her arms; and beyond perilous moors the brave sea glittered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">The great events of Babbitt's spring were the secret buying
  of real-estate options in Linton for certain street-traction officials,
  before the public announcement that the Linton Avenue Car Line would be
  extended, and a dinner which was, as he rejoiced to his wife, not only "a
  regular society spread but a real sure-enough highbrow affair, with some of
  the keenest intellects and the brightest bunch of little women in town." It
  was so absorbing an occasion that he almost forgot his desire to run off to
  Maine with Paul Riesling.</p>

  <p>Though he had been born in the village of Catawba, Babbitt had risen to
  that metropolitan social plane on which hosts have as many as four people at
  dinner without planning it for more than an evening or two. But a dinner of
  twelve, with flowers from the florist's and all the cut-glass out, staggered
  even the Babbitts.</p>

  <p>For two weeks they studied, debated, and arbitrated the list of
  guests.</p>

  <p>Babbitt marveled, "Of course we're up-to-date ourselves, but still, think
  of us entertaining a famous poet like Chum Frink, a fellow that on nothing
  but a poem or so every day and just writing a few advertisements pulls down
  fifteen thousand berries a year!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and Howard Littlefield. Do you know, the other evening Eunice told
  me her papa speaks three languages!" said Mrs. Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"Huh! That's nothing! So do I&mdash;American, baseball, and poker!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think it's nice to be funny about a matter like that. Think how
  wonderful it must be to speak three languages, and so useful and&mdash;And
  with people like that, I don't see why we invite the Orville Joneses."</p>

  <p>"Well now, Orville is a mighty up-and-coming fellow!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know, but&mdash;A laundry!"</p>

  <p>"I'll admit a laundry hasn't got the class of poetry or real estate, but
  just the same, Orvy is mighty deep. Ever start him spieling about gardening?
  Say, that fellow can tell you the name of every kind of tree, and some of
  their Greek and Latin names too! Besides, we owe the Joneses a dinner.
  Besides, gosh, we got to have some boob for audience, when a bunch of hot-air
  artists like Frink and Littlefield get going."</p>

  <p>"Well, dear&mdash;I meant to speak of this&mdash;I do think that as host
  you ought to sit back and listen, and let your guests have a chance to talk
  once in a while!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you do, do you! Sure! I talk all the time! And I'm just a business
  man&mdash;oh sure!&mdash;I'm no Ph.D. like Littlefield, and no poet, and I
  haven't anything to spring! Well, let me tell you, just the other day your
  darn Chum Frink comes up to me at the club begging to know what I thought
  about the Springfield school-bond issue. And who told him? I did! You bet
  your life I told him! Little me! I certainly did! He came up and asked me,
  and I told him all about it! You bet! And he was darn glad to listen to me
  and&mdash;Duty as a host! I guess I know my duty as a host and let me tell
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In fact, the Orville Joneses were invited.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">On the morning of the dinner, Mrs. Babbitt was restive.</p>

  <p>"Now, George, I want you to be sure and be home early tonight. Remember,
  you have to dress."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh. I see by the <i>Advocate</i> that the Presbyterian General
  Assembly has voted to quit the Interchurch World Movement. That&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"George! Did you hear what I said? You must be home in time to dress
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"Dress? Hell! I'm dressed now! Think I'm going down to the office in my
  B.V.D.'s?"</p>

  <p>"I will not have you talking indecently before the children! And you do
  have to put on your dinner-jacket!"</p>

  <p>"I guess you mean my Tux. I tell you, of all the doggone nonsensical
  nuisances that was ever invented&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Three minutes later, after Babbitt had wailed, "Well, I don't know whether
  I'm going to dress or <i>not</i>" in a manner which showed that he was going
  to dress, the discussion moved on.</p>

  <p>"Now, George, you mustn't forget to call in at Vecchia's on the way home
  and get the ice cream. Their delivery-wagon is broken down, and I don't want
  to trust them to send it by&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right! You told me that before breakfast!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't want you to forget. I'll be working my head off all day
  long, training the girl that's to help with the dinner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All nonsense, anyway, hiring an extra girl for the feed. Matilda could
  perfectly well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and I have to go out and buy the flowers, and fix them, and set
  the table, and order the salted almonds, and look at the chickens, and
  arrange for the children to have their supper upstairs and&mdash;And I simply
  must depend on you to go to Vecchia's for the ice cream."</p>

  <p>"All riiiiiight! Gosh, I'm going to get it!"</p>

  <p>"All you have to do is to go in and say you want the ice cream that Mrs.
  Babbitt ordered yesterday by 'phone, and it will be all ready for you."</p>

  <p>At ten-thirty she telephoned to him not to forget the ice cream from
  Vecchia's.</p>

  <p>He was surprised and blasted then by a thought. He wondered whether Floral
  Heights dinners were worth the hideous toil involved. But he repented the
  sacrilege in the excitement of buying the materials for cocktails.</p>

  <p>Now this was the manner of obtaining alcohol under the reign of
  righteousness and prohibition:</p>

  <p>He drove from the severe rectangular streets of the modern business center
  into the tangled byways of Old Town&mdash;jagged blocks filled with sooty
  warehouses and lofts; on into The Arbor, once a pleasant orchard but now a
  morass of lodging-houses, tenements, and brothels. Exquisite shivers chilled
  his spine and stomach, and he looked at every policeman with intense
  innocence, as one who loved the law, and admired the Force, and longed to
  stop and play with them. He parked his car a block from Healey Hanson's
  saloon, worrying, "Well, rats, if anybody did see me, they'd think I was here
  on business."</p>

  <p>He entered a place curiously like the saloons of ante-prohibition days,
  with a long greasy bar with sawdust in front and streaky mirror behind, a
  pine table at which a dirty old man dreamed over a glass of something which
  resembled whisky, and with two men at the bar, drinking something which
  resembled beer, and giving that impression of forming a large crowd which two
  men always give in a saloon. The bartender, a tall pale Swede with a diamond
  in his lilac scarf, stared at Babbitt as he stalked plumply up to the bar and
  whispered, "I'd, uh&mdash;Friend of Hanson's sent me here. Like to get some
  gin."</p>

  <p>The bartender gazed down on him in the manner of an outraged bishop. "I
  guess you got the wrong place, my friend. We sell nothing but soft drinks
  here." He cleaned the bar with a rag which would itself have done with a
  little cleaning, and glared across his mechanically moving elbow.</p>

  <p>The old dreamer at the table petitioned the bartender, "Say, Oscar,
  listen."</p>

  <p>Oscar did not listen.</p>

  <p>"Aw, say, Oscar, listen, will yuh? Say, lis-sen!"</p>

  <p>The decayed and drowsy voice of the loafer, the agreeable stink of
  beer-dregs, threw a spell of inanition over Babbitt. The bartender moved
  grimly toward the crowd of two men. Babbitt followed him as delicately as a
  cat, and wheedled, "Say, Oscar, I want to speak to Mr. Hanson."</p>

  <p>"Whajuh wanta see him for?"</p>

  <p>"I just want to talk to him. Here's my card."</p>

  <p>It was a beautiful card, an engraved card, a card in the blackest black
  and the sharpest red, announcing that Mr. George F. Babbitt was Estates,
  Insurance, Rents. The bartender held it as though it weighed ten pounds, and
  read it as though it were a hundred words long. He did not bend from his
  episcopal dignity, but he growled, "I'll see if he's around."</p>

  <p>From the back room he brought an immensely old young man, a quiet
  sharp-eyed man, in tan silk shirt, checked vest hanging open, and burning
  brown trousers&mdash;Mr. Healey Hanson. Mr. Hanson said only "Yuh?" but his
  implacable and contemptuous eyes queried Babbitt's soul, and he seemed not at
  all impressed by the new dark-gray suit for which (as he had admitted to
  every acquaintance at the Athletic Club) Babbitt had paid a hundred and
  twenty-five dollars.</p>

  <p>"Glad meet you, Mr. Hanson. Say, uh&mdash;I'm George Babbitt of the
  Babbitt-Thompson Realty Company. I'm a great friend of Jake Offutt's."</p>

  <p>"Well, what of it?"</p>

  <p>"Say, uh, I'm going to have a party, and Jake told me you'd be able to fix
  me up with a little gin." In alarm, in obsequiousness, as Hanson's eyes grew
  more bored, "You telephone to Jake about me, if you want to."</p>

  <p>Hanson answered by jerking his head to indicate the entrance to the back
  room, and strolled away. Babbitt melodramatically crept into an apartment
  containing four round tables, eleven chairs, a brewery calendar, and a smell.
  He waited. Thrice he saw Healey Hanson saunter through, humming, hands in
  pockets, ignoring him.</p>

  <p>By this time Babbitt had modified his valiant morning vow, "I won't pay
  one cent over seven dollars a quart" to "I might pay ten." On Hanson's next
  weary entrance he besought "Could you fix that up?" Hanson scowled, and
  grated, "Just a minute&mdash;Pete's sake&mdash;just a min-ute!" In growing
  meekness Babbitt went on waiting till Hanson casually reappeared with a quart
  of gin&mdash;what is euphemistically known as a quart&mdash;in his disdainful
  long white hands.</p>

  <p>"Twelve bucks," he snapped.</p>

  <p>"Say, uh, but say, cap'n, Jake thought you'd be able to fix me up for
  eight or nine a bottle."</p>

  <p>"Nup. Twelve. This is the real stuff, smuggled from Canada. This is none
  o' your neutral spirits with a drop of juniper extract," the honest merchant
  said virtuously. "Twelve bones&mdash;if you want it. Course y' understand I'm
  just doing this anyway as a friend of Jake's."</p>

  <p>"Sure! Sure! I understand!" Babbitt gratefully held out twelve dollars. He
  felt honored by contact with greatness as Hanson yawned, stuffed the bills,
  uncounted, into his radiant vest, and swaggered away.</p>

  <p>He had a number of titillations out of concealing the gin-bottle under his
  coat and out of hiding it in his desk. All afternoon he snorted and chuckled
  and gurgled over his ability to "give the Boys a real shot in the arm
  to-night." He was, in fact, so exhilarated that he was within a block of his
  house before he remembered that there was a certain matter, mentioned by his
  wife, of fetching ice cream from Vecchia's. He explained, "Well, darn
  it&mdash;" and drove back.</p>

  <p>Vecchia was not a caterer, he was The Caterer of Zenith. Most coming-out
  parties were held in the white and gold ballroom of the Maison Vecchia; at
  all nice teas the guests recognized the five kinds of Vecchia sandwiches and
  the seven kinds of Vecchia cakes; and all really smart dinners ended, as on a
  resolving chord, in Vecchia Neapolitan ice cream in one of the three reliable
  molds&mdash;the melon mold, the round mold like a layer cake, and the long
  brick.</p>

  <p>Vecchia's shop had pale blue woodwork, tracery of plaster roses,
  attendants in frilled aprons, and glass shelves of "kisses" with all the
  refinement that inheres in whites of eggs. Babbitt felt heavy and thick amid
  this professional daintiness, and as he waited for the ice cream he decided,
  with hot prickles at the back of his neck, that a girl customer was giggling
  at him. He went home in a touchy temper. The first thing he heard was his
  wife's agitated:</p>

  <p>"George! <i>Did</i> you remember to go to Vecchia's and get the ice
  cream?"</p>

  <p>"Say! Look here! Do I ever forget to do things?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! Often!"</p>

  <p>"Well now, it's darn seldom I do, and it certainly makes me tired, after
  going into a pink-tea joint like Vecchia's and having to stand around looking
  at a lot of half-naked young girls, all rouged up like they were sixty and
  eating a lot of stuff that simply ruins their stomachs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's too bad about you! I've noticed how you hate to look at pretty
  girls!"</p>

  <p>With a jar Babbitt realized that his wife was too busy to be impressed by
  that moral indignation with which males rule the world, and he went humbly
  up-stairs to dress. He had an impression of a glorified dining-room, of
  cut-glass, candles, polished wood, lace, silver, roses. With the awed
  swelling of the heart suitable to so grave a business as giving a dinner, he
  slew the temptation to wear his plaited dress-shirt for a fourth time, took
  out an entirely fresh one, tightened his black bow, and rubbed his
  patent-leather pumps with a handkerchief. He glanced with pleasure at his
  garnet and silver studs. He smoothed and patted his ankles, transformed by
  silk socks from the sturdy shanks of George Babbitt to the elegant limbs of
  what is called a Clubman. He stood before the pier-glass, viewing his trim
  dinner-coat, his beautiful triple-braided trousers; and murmured in lyric
  beatitude, "By golly, I don't look so bad. I certainly don't look like
  Catawba. If the hicks back home could see me in this rig, they'd have a
  fit!"</p>

  <p>He moved majestically down to mix the cocktails. As he chipped ice, as he
  squeezed oranges, as he collected vast stores of bottles, glasses, and spoons
  at the sink in the pantry, he felt as authoritative as the bartender at
  Healey Hanson's saloon. True, Mrs. Babbitt said he was under foot, and
  Matilda and the maid hired for the evening brushed by him, elbowed him,
  shrieked "Pleasopn door," as they tottered through with trays, but in this
  high moment he ignored them.</p>

  <p>Besides the new bottle of gin, his cellar consisted of one half-bottle of
  Bourbon whisky, a quarter of a bottle of Italian vermouth, and approximately
  one hundred drops of orange bitters. He did not possess a cocktail-shaker. A
  shaker was proof of dissipation, the symbol of a Drinker, and Babbitt
  disliked being known as a Drinker even more than he liked a Drink. He mixed
  by pouring from an ancient gravy-boat into a handleless pitcher; he poured
  with a noble dignity, holding his alembics high beneath the powerful Mazda
  globe, his face hot, his shirt-front a glaring white, the copper sink a
  scoured red-gold.</p>

  <p>He tasted the sacred essence. "Now, by golly, if that isn't pretty near
  one fine old cocktail! Kind of a Bronx, and yet like a Manhattan. Ummmmmm!
  Hey, Myra, want a little nip before the folks come?"</p>

  <p>Bustling into the dining-room, moving each glass a quarter of an inch,
  rushing back with resolution implacable on her face her gray and silver-lace
  party frock protected by a denim towel, Mrs. Babbitt glared at him, and
  rebuked him, "Certainly not!"</p>

  <p>"Well," in a loose, jocose manner, "I think the old man will!"</p>

  <p>The cocktail filled him with a whirling exhilaration behind which he was
  aware of devastating desires&mdash;to rush places in fast motors, to kiss
  girls, to sing, to be witty. He sought to regain his lost dignity by
  announcing to Matilda:</p>

  <p>"I'm going to stick this pitcher of cocktails in the refrigerator. Be sure
  you don't upset any of 'em."</p>

  <p>"Yeh."</p>

  <p>"Well, be sure now. Don't go putting anything on this top shelf."</p>

  <p>"Yeh."</p>

  <p>"Well, be&mdash;" He was dizzy. His voice was thin and distant. "Whee!"
  With enormous impressiveness he commanded, "Well, be sure now," and minced
  into the safety of the living-room. He wondered whether he could persuade "as
  slow a bunch as Myra and the Littlefields to go some place aft' dinner and
  raise Cain and maybe dig up smore booze." He perceived that he had gifts of
  profligacy which had been neglected.</p>

  <p>By the time the guests had come, including the inevitable late couple for
  whom the others waited with painful amiability, a great gray emptiness had
  replaced the purple swirling in Babbitt's head, and he had to force the
  tumultuous greetings suitable to a host on Floral Heights.</p>

  <p>The guests were Howard Littlefield, the doctor of philosophy who furnished
  publicity and comforting economics to the Street Traction Company; Vergil
  Gunch, the coal-dealer, equally powerful in the Elks and in the Boosters'
  Club; Eddie Swanson the agent for the Javelin Motor Car, who lived across the
  street; and Orville Jones, owner of the Lily White Laundry, which justly
  announced itself "the biggest, busiest, bulliest cleanerie shoppe in Zenith."
  But, naturally, the most distinguished of all was T. Cholmondeley Frink, who
  was not only the author of "Poemulations," which, syndicated daily in
  sixty-seven leading newspapers, gave him one of the largest audiences of any
  poet in the world, but also an optimistic lecturer and the creator of "Ads
  that Add." Despite the searching philosophy and high morality of his verses,
  they were humorous and easily understood by any child of twelve; and it added
  a neat air of pleasantry to them that they were set not as verse but as
  prose. Mr. Frink was known from Coast to Coast as "Chum."</p>

  <p>With them were six wives, more or less&mdash;it was hard to tell, so early
  in the evening, as at first glance they all looked alike, and as they all
  said, "Oh, <i>isn't</i> this nice!" in the same tone of determined
  liveliness. To the eye, the men were less similar: Littlefield, a
  hedge-scholar, tall and horse-faced; Chum Frink, a trifle of a man with soft
  and mouse-like hair, advertising his profession as poet by a silk cord on his
  eye-glasses; Vergil Gunch, broad, with coarse black hair en brosse; Eddie
  Swanson, a bald and bouncing young man who showed his taste for elegance by
  an evening waistcoat of figured black silk with glass buttons; Orville Jones,
  a steady-looking, stubby, not very memorable person, with a hemp-colored
  toothbrush mustache. Yet they were all so well fed and clean, they all
  shouted "'Evenin', Georgie!" with such robustness, that they seemed to be
  cousins, and the strange thing is that the longer one knew the women, the
  less alike they seemed; while the longer one knew the men, the more alike
  their bold patterns appeared.</p>

  <p>The drinking of the cocktails was as canonical a rite as the mixing. The
  company waited, uneasily, hopefully, agreeing in a strained manner that the
  weather had been rather warm and slightly cold, but still Babbitt said
  nothing about drinks. They became despondent. But when the late couple (the
  Swansons) had arrived, Babbitt hinted, "Well, folks, do you think you could
  stand breaking the law a little?"</p>

  <p>They looked at Chum Frink, the recognized lord of language. Frink pulled
  at his eye-glass cord as at a bell-rope, he cleared his throat and said that
  which was the custom:</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you, George: I'm a law-abiding man, but they do say Verg Gunch
  is a regular yegg, and of course he's bigger 'n I am, and I just can't figure
  out what I'd do if he tried to force me into anything criminal!"</p>

  <p>Gunch was roaring, "Well, I'll take a chance&mdash;" when Frink held up
  his hand and went on, "So if Verg and you insist, Georgie, I'll park my car
  on the wrong side of the street, because I take it for granted that's the
  crime you're hinting at!"</p>

  <p>There was a great deal of laughter. Mrs. Jones asserted, "Mr. Frink is
  simply too killing! You'd think he was so innocent!"</p>

  <p>Babbitt clamored, "How did you guess it, Chum? Well, you-all just wait a
  moment while I go out and get the&mdash;keys to your cars!" Through a froth
  of merriment he brought the shining promise, the mighty tray of glasses with
  the cloudy yellow cocktails in the glass pitcher in the center. The men
  babbled, "Oh, gosh, have a look!" and "This gets me right where I live!" and
  "Let me at it!" But Chum Frink, a traveled man and not unused to woes, was
  stricken by the thought that the potion might be merely fruit-juice with a
  little neutral spirits. He looked timorous as Babbitt, a moist and ecstatic
  almoner, held out a glass, but as he tasted it he piped, "Oh, man, let me
  dream on! It ain't true, but don't waken me! Jus' lemme slumber!"</p>

  <p>Two hours before, Frink had completed a newspaper lyric beginning:</p>

  <p><i>I sat alone and groused and thunk, and scratched my head and sighed and
  wunk, and groaned, "There still are boobs, alack, who'd like the old-time
  gin-mill back; that den that makes a sage a loon, the vile and smelly old
  saloon!" I'll never miss their poison booze, whilst I the bubbling spring can
  use, that leaves my head at merry morn as clear as any babe new-born!</i></p>

  <p>Babbitt drank with the others; his moment's depression was gone; he
  perceived that these were the best fellows in the world; he wanted to give
  them a thousand cocktails. "Think you could stand another?" he cried. The
  wives refused, with giggles, but the men, speaking in a wide, elaborate,
  enjoyable manner, gloated, "Well, sooner than have you get sore at me,
  Georgie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You got a little dividend coming," said Babbitt to each of them, and each
  intoned, "Squeeze it, Georgie, squeeze it!"</p>

  <p>When, beyond hope, the pitcher was empty, they stood and talked about
  prohibition. The men leaned back on their heels, put their hands in their
  trousers-pockets, and proclaimed their views with the booming profundity of a
  prosperous male repeating a thoroughly hackneyed statement about a matter of
  which he knows nothing whatever.</p>

  <p>"Now, I'll tell you," said Vergil Gunch; "way I figure it is this, and I
  can speak by the book, because I've talked to a lot of doctors and fellows
  that ought to know, and the way I see it is that it's a good thing to get rid
  of the saloon, but they ought to let a fellow have beer and light wines."</p>

  <p>Howard Littlefield observed, "What isn't generally realized is that it's a
  dangerous prop'sition to invade the rights of personal liberty. Now, take
  this for instance: The King of&mdash;Bavaria? I think it was
  Bavaria&mdash;yes, Bavaria, it was&mdash;in 1862, March, 1862, he issued a
  proclamation against public grazing of live-stock. The peasantry had stood
  for overtaxation without the slightest complaint, but when this proclamation
  came out, they rebelled. Or it may have been Saxony. But it just goes to show
  the dangers of invading the rights of personal liberty."</p>

  <p>"That's it&mdash;no one got a right to invade personal liberty," said
  Orville Jones.</p>

  <p>"Just the same, you don't want to forget prohibition is a mighty good
  thing for the working-classes. Keeps 'em from wasting their money and
  lowering their productiveness," said Vergil Gunch.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's so. But the trouble is the manner of enforcement," insisted
  Howard Littlefield. "Congress didn't understand the right system. Now, if I'd
  been running the thing, I'd have arranged it so that the drinker himself was
  licensed, and then we could have taken care of the shiftless
  workman&mdash;kept him from drinking&mdash;and yet not 've interfered with
  the rights&mdash;with the personal liberty&mdash;of fellows like
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>They bobbed their heads, looked admiringly at one another, and stated,
  "That's so, that would be the stunt."</p>

  <p>"The thing that worries me is that a lot of these guys will take to
  cocaine," sighed Eddie Swanson.</p>

  <p>They bobbed more violently, and groaned, "That's so, there is a danger of
  that."</p>

  <p>Chum Frink chanted, "Oh, say, I got hold of a swell new receipt for
  home-made beer the other day. You take&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gunch interrupted, "Wait! Let me tell you mine!" Littlefield snorted,
  "Beer! Rats! Thing to do is to ferment cider!" Jones insisted, "I've got the
  receipt that does the business!" Swanson begged, "Oh, say, lemme tell you the
  story&mdash;" But Frink went on resolutely, "You take and save the shells
  from peas, and pour six gallons of water on a bushel of shells and boil the
  mixture till&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Babbitt turned toward them with yearning sweetness; Frink hastened to
  finish even his best beer-recipe; and she said gaily, "Dinner is served."</p>

  <p>There was a good deal of friendly argument among the men as to which
  should go in last, and while they were crossing the hall from the living-room
  to the dining-room Vergil Gunch made them laugh by thundering, "If I can't
  sit next to Myra Babbitt and hold her hand under the table, I won't
  play&mdash;I'm goin' home." In the dining-room they stood embarrassed while
  Mrs. Babbitt fluttered, "Now, let me see&mdash;Oh, I was going to have some
  nice hand-painted place-cards for you but&mdash;Oh, let me see; Mr. Frink,
  you sit there."</p>

  <p>The dinner was in the best style of women's-magazine art, whereby the
  salad was served in hollowed apples, and everything but the invincible fried
  chicken resembled something else. Ordinarily the men found it hard to talk to
  the women; flirtation was an art unknown on Floral Heights, and the realms of
  offices and of kitchens had no alliances. But under the inspiration of the
  cocktails, conversation was violent. Each of the men still had a number of
  important things to say about prohibition, and now that each had a loyal
  listener in his dinner-partner he burst out:</p>

  <p>"I found a place where I can get all the hootch I want at eight a
  quart&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did you read about this fellow that went and paid a thousand dollars for
  ten cases of red-eye that proved to be nothing but water? Seems this fellow
  was standing on the corner and fellow comes up to him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They say there's a whole raft of stuff being smuggled across at
  Detroit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What I always say is&mdash;what a lot of folks don't realize about
  prohibition&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And then you get all this awful poison stuff&mdash;wood alcohol and
  everything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Course I believe in it on principle, but I don't propose to have anybody
  telling me what I got to think and do. No American 'll ever stand for
  that!"</p>

  <p>But they all felt that it was rather in bad taste for Orville
  Jones&mdash;and he not recognized as one of the wits of the occasion
  anyway&mdash;to say, "In fact, the whole thing about prohibition is this: it
  isn't the initial cost, it's the humidity."</p>

  <p>Not till the one required topic had been dealt with did the conversation
  become general.</p>

  <p>It was often and admiringly said of Vergil Gunch, "Gee, that fellow can
  get away with murder! Why, he can pull a Raw One in mixed company and all the
  ladies 'll laugh their heads off, but me, gosh, if I crack anything that's
  just the least bit off color I get the razz for fair!" Now Gunch delighted
  them by crying to Mrs. Eddie Swanson, youngest of the women, "Louetta! I
  managed to pinch Eddie's doorkey out of his pocket, and what say you and me
  sneak across the street when the folks aren't looking? Got something," with a
  gorgeous leer, "awful important to tell you!"</p>

  <p>The women wriggled, and Babbitt was stirred to like naughtiness. "Say,
  folks, I wished I dared show you a book I borrowed from Doc Patten!"</p>

  <p>"Now, George! The idea!" Mrs. Babbitt warned him.</p>

  <p>"This book&mdash;racy isn't the word! It's some kind of an anthropological
  report about&mdash;about Customs, in the South Seas, and what it doesn't
  <i>say</i>! It's a book you can't buy. Verg, I'll lend it to you."</p>

  <p>"Me first!" insisted Eddie Swanson. "Sounds spicy!"</p>

  <p>Orville Jones announced, "Say, I heard a Good One the other day about a
  coupla Swedes and their wives," and, in the best Jewish accent, he resolutely
  carried the Good One to a slightly disinfected ending. Gunch capped it. But
  the cocktails waned, the seekers dropped back into cautious reality.</p>

  <p>Chum Frink had recently been on a lecture-tour among the small towns, and
  he chuckled, "Awful good to get back to civilization! I certainly been seeing
  some hick towns! I mean&mdash;Course the folks there are the best on earth,
  but, gee whiz, those Main Street burgs are slow, and you fellows can't hardly
  appreciate what it means to be here with a bunch of live ones!"</p>

  <p>"You bet!" exulted Orville Jones. "They're the best folks on earth, those
  small-town folks, but, oh, mama! what conversation! Why, say, they can't talk
  about anything but the weather and the ne-oo Ford, by heckalorum!"</p>

  <p>"That's right. They all talk about just the same things," said Eddie
  Swanson.</p>

  <p>"Don't they, though! They just say the same things over and over," said
  Vergil Gunch.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's really remarkable. They seem to lack all power of looking at
  things impersonally. They simply go over and over the same talk about Fords
  and the weather and so on." said Howard Littlefield.</p>

  <p>"Still, at that, you can't blame 'em. They haven't got any intellectual
  stimulus such as you get up here in the city," said Chum Frink.</p>

  <p>"Gosh, that's right," said Babbitt. "I don't want you highbrows to get
  stuck on yourselves but I must say it keeps a fellow right up on his toes to
  sit in with a poet and with Howard, the guy that put the con in economics!
  But these small-town boobs, with nobody but each other to talk to, no wonder
  they get so sloppy and uncultured in their speech, and so balled-up in their
  thinking!"</p>

  <p>Orville Jones commented, "And, then take our other advantages&mdash;the
  movies, frinstance. These Yapville sports think they're all-get-out if they
  have one change of bill a week, where here in the city you got your choice of
  a dozen diff'rent movies any evening you want to name!"</p>

  <p>"Sure, and the inspiration we get from rubbing up against high-class
  hustlers every day and getting jam full of ginger," said Eddie Swanson.</p>

  <p>"Same time," said Babbitt, "no sense excusing these rube burgs too easy.
  Fellow's own fault if he doesn't show the initiative to up and beat it to the
  city, like we done&mdash;did. And, just speaking in confidence among friends,
  they're jealous as the devil of a city man. Every time I go up to Catawba I
  have to go around apologizing to the fellows I was brought up with because
  I've more or less succeeded and they haven't. And if you talk natural to 'em,
  way we do here, and show finesse and what you might call a broad point of
  view, why, they think you're putting on side. There's my own half-brother
  Martin&mdash;runs the little ole general store my Dad used to keep. Say, I'll
  bet he don't know there is such a thing as a Tux&mdash;as a dinner-jacket. If
  he was to come in here now, he'd think we were a bunch of&mdash;of&mdash;Why,
  gosh, I swear, he wouldn't know what to think! Yes, sir, they're
  jealous!"</p>

  <p>Chum Frink agreed, "That's so. But what I mind is their lack of culture
  and appreciation of the Beautiful&mdash;if you'll excuse me for being
  highbrow. Now, I like to give a high-class lecture, and read some of my best
  poetry&mdash;not the newspaper stuff but the magazine things. But say, when I
  get out in the tall grass, there's nothing will take but a lot of cheesy old
  stories and slang and junk that if any of us were to indulge in it here, he'd
  get the gate so fast it would make his head swim."</p>

  <p>Vergil Gunch summed it up: "Fact is, we're mighty lucky to be living among
  a bunch of city-folks, that recognize artistic things and business-punch
  equally. We'd feel pretty glum if we got stuck in some Main Street burg and
  tried to wise up the old codgers to the kind of life we're used to here. But,
  by golly, there's this you got to say for 'em: Every small American town is
  trying to get population and modern ideals. And darn if a lot of 'em don't
  put it across! Somebody starts panning a rube crossroads, telling how he was
  there in 1900 and it consisted of one muddy street, count 'em, one, and nine
  hundred human clams. Well, you go back there in 1920, and you find pavements
  and a swell little hotel and a first-class ladies' ready-to-wear shop-real
  perfection, in fact! You don't want to just look at what these small towns
  are, you want to look at what they're aiming to become, and they all got an
  ambition that in the long run is going to make 'em the finest spots on
  earth&mdash;they all want to be just like Zenith!"</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">However intimate they might be with T. Cholmondeley Frink as
  a neighbor, as a borrower of lawn-mowers and monkey-wrenches, they knew that
  he was also a Famous Poet and a distinguished advertising-agent; that behind
  his easiness were sultry literary mysteries which they could not penetrate.
  But to-night, in the gin-evolved confidence, he admitted them to the
  arcanum:</p>

  <p>"I've got a literary problem that's worrying me to death. I'm doing a
  series of ads for the Zeeco Car and I want to make each of 'em a real little
  gem&mdash;reg'lar stylistic stuff. I'm all for this theory that perfection is
  the stunt, or nothing at all, and these are as tough things as I ever
  tackled. You might think it'd be harder to do my poems&mdash;all these Heart
  Topics: home and fireside and happiness&mdash;but they're cinches. You can't
  go wrong on 'em; you know what sentiments any decent go-ahead fellow must
  have if he plays the game, and you stick right to 'em. But the poetry of
  industrialism, now there's a literary line where you got to open up new
  territory. Do you know the fellow who's really <i>the</i> American genius?
  The fellow who you don't know his name and I don't either, but his work ought
  to be preserved so's future generations can judge our American thought and
  originality to-day? Why, the fellow that writes the Prince Albert Tobacco
  ads! Just listen to this:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"It's P.A. that jams such joy in jimmy pipes. Say&mdash;bet
  you've often bent-an-ear to that spill-of-speech about hopping from five to
  f-i-f-t-y p-e-r by "stepping on her a bit!" Guess that's going some, all
  right&mdash;BUT&mdash;just among ourselves, you better start a rapidwhiz
  system to keep tabs as to how fast you'll buzz from low smoke spirits to
  <i>tip-top-high</i>&mdash;once you line up behind a jimmy pipe that's all
  aglow with that peach-of-a-pal, Prince Albert.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Prince Albert is john-on-the-job&mdash;always joy'usly
  more-<i>ish</i> in flavor; always delightfully cool and fragrant! For a fact,
  you never hooked such double-decked, copper-riveted, two-fisted smoke
  enjoyment!</p>

  <p class="quote">"Go to a pipe&mdash;speed-o-quick like you light on a good
  thing! Why&mdash;packed with Prince Albert you can play a joy'us jimmy
  straight across the boards! And you know what that means!"</p><br>

  <p>"Now that," caroled the motor agent, Eddie Swanson, "that's what I call
  he-literature! That Prince Albert fellow&mdash;though, gosh, there can't be
  just one fellow that writes 'em; must be a big board of classy ink-slingers
  in conference, but anyway: now, him, he doesn't write for long-haired pikers,
  he writes for Regular Guys, he writes for <i>me</i>, and I tip my benny to
  him! The only thing is: I wonder if it sells the goods? Course, like all
  these poets, this Prince Albert fellow lets his idea run away with him. It
  makes elegant reading, but it don't say nothing. I'd never go out and buy
  Prince Albert Tobacco after reading it, because it doesn't tell me anything
  about the stuff. It's just a bunch of fluff."</p>

  <p>Frink faced him: "Oh, you're crazy! Have I got to sell you the idea of
  Style? Anyway that's the kind of stuff I'd like to do for the Zeeco. But I
  simply can't. So I decided to stick to the straight poetic, and I took a shot
  at a highbrow ad for the Zeeco. How do you like this:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"The long white trail is calling&mdash;calling-and it's over
  the hills and far away for every man or woman that has red blood in his veins
  and on his lips the ancient song of the buccaneers. It's away with dull
  drudging, and a fig for care. Speed&mdash;glorious Speed&mdash;it's more than
  just a moment's exhilaration&mdash;it's Life for you and me! This great new
  truth the makers of the Zeeco Car have considered as much as price and style.
  It's fleet as the antelope, smooth as the glide of a swallow, yet powerful as
  the charge of a bull-elephant. Class breathes in every line. Listen, brother!
  You'll never know what the high art of hiking is till you TRY LIFE'S
  ZIPPINGEST ZEST&mdash;THE ZEECO!"</p><br>

  <p>"Yes," Frink mused, "that's got an elegant color to it, if I do say so,
  but it ain't got the originality of 'spill-of-speech!'" The whole company
  sighed with sympathy and admiration.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">Babbitt was fond of his friends, he loved the importance of
  being host and shouting, "Certainly, you're going to have smore
  chicken&mdash;the idea!" and he appreciated the genius of T. Cholmondeley
  Frink, but the vigor of the cocktails was gone, and the more he ate the less
  joyful he felt. Then the amity of the dinner was destroyed by the nagging of
  the Swansons.</p>

  <p>In Floral Heights and the other prosperous sections of Zenith, especially
  in the "young married set," there were many women who had nothing to do.
  Though they had few servants, yet with gas stoves, electric ranges and
  dish-washers and vacuum cleaners, and tiled kitchen walls, their houses were
  so convenient that they had little housework, and much of their food came
  from bakeries and delicatessens. They had but two, one, or no children; and
  despite the myth that the Great War had made work respectable, their husbands
  objected to their "wasting time and getting a lot of crank ideas" in unpaid
  social work, and still more to their causing a rumor, by earning money, that
  they were not adequately supported. They worked perhaps two hours a day, and
  the rest of the time they ate chocolates, went to the motion-pictures, went
  window-shopping, went in gossiping twos and threes to card-parties, read
  magazines, thought timorously of the lovers who never appeared, and
  accumulated a splendid restlessness which they got rid of by nagging their
  husbands. The husbands nagged back.</p>

  <p>Of these naggers the Swansons were perfect specimens.</p>

  <p>Throughout the dinner Eddie Swanson had been complaining, publicly, about
  his wife's new frock. It was, he submitted, too short, too low, too
  immodestly thin, and much too expensive. He appealed to Babbitt:</p>

  <p>"Honest, George, what do you think of that rag Louetta went and bought?
  Don't you think it's the limit?"</p>

  <p>"What's eating you, Eddie? I call it a swell little dress."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is, Mr. Swanson. It's a sweet frock," Mrs. Babbitt protested.</p>

  <p>"There now, do you see, smarty! You're such an authority on clothes!"
  Louetta raged, while the guests ruminated and peeped at her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That's all right now," said Swanson. "I'm authority enough so I know it
  was a waste of money, and it makes me tired to see you not wearing out a
  whole closetful of clothes you got already. I've expressed my idea about this
  before, and you know good and well you didn't pay the least bit of attention.
  I have to camp on your trail to get you to do anything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was much more of it, and they all assisted, all but Babbitt.
  Everything about him was dim except his stomach, and that was a bright
  scarlet disturbance. "Had too much grub; oughtn't to eat this stuff," he
  groaned&mdash;while he went on eating, while he gulped down a chill and
  glutinous slice of the ice-cream brick, and cocoanut cake as oozy as
  shaving-cream. He felt as though he had been stuffed with clay; his body was
  bursting, his throat was bursting, his brain was hot mud; and only with agony
  did he continue to smile and shout as became a host on Floral Heights.</p>

  <p>He would, except for his guests, have fled outdoors and walked off the
  intoxication of food, but in the haze which filled the room they sat forever,
  talking, talking, while he agonized, "Darn fool to be eating all
  this&mdash;not 'nother mouthful," and discovered that he was again tasting
  the sickly welter of melted ice cream on his plate. There was no magic in his
  friends; he was not uplifted when Howard Littlefield produced from his
  treasure-house of scholarship the information that the chemical symbol for
  raw rubber is C10H16, which turns into isoprene, or 2C5H8. Suddenly, without
  precedent, Babbitt was not merely bored but admitting that he was bored. It
  was ecstasy to escape from the table, from the torture of a straight chair,
  and loll on the davenport in the living-room.</p>

  <p>The others, from their fitful unconvincing talk, their expressions of
  being slowly and painfully smothered, seemed to be suffering from the toil of
  social life and the horror of good food as much as himself. All of them
  accepted with relief the suggestion of bridge.</p>

  <p>Babbitt recovered from the feeling of being boiled. He won at bridge. He
  was again able to endure Vergil Gunch's inexorable heartiness. But he
  pictured loafing with Paul Riesling beside a lake in Maine. It was as
  overpowering and imaginative as homesickness. He had never seen Maine, yet he
  beheld the shrouded mountains, the tranquil lake of evening. "That boy Paul's
  worth all these ballyhooing highbrows put together," he muttered; and, "I'd
  like to get away from&mdash;everything."</p>

  <p>Even Louetta Swanson did not rouse him.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Swanson was pretty and pliant. Babbitt was not an analyst of women,
  except as to their tastes in Furnished Houses to Rent. He divided them into
  Real Ladies, Working Women, Old Cranks, and Fly Chickens. He mooned over
  their charms but he was of opinion that all of them (save the women of his
  own family) were "different" and "mysterious." Yet he had known by instinct
  that Louetta Swanson could be approached. Her eyes and lips were moist. Her
  face tapered from a broad forehead to a pointed chin, her mouth was thin but
  strong and avid, and between her brows were two outcurving and passionate
  wrinkles. She was thirty, perhaps, or younger. Gossip had never touched her,
  but every man naturally and instantly rose to flirtatiousness when he spoke
  to her, and every woman watched her with stilled blankness.</p>

  <p>Between games, sitting on the davenport, Babbitt spoke to her with the
  requisite gallantry, that sonorous Floral Heights gallantry which is not
  flirtation but a terrified flight from it: "You're looking like a new
  soda-fountain to night, Louetta."</p>

  <p>"Am I?"</p>

  <p>"Ole Eddie kind of on the rampage."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I get so sick of it."</p>

  <p>"Well, when you get tired of hubby, you can run off with Uncle
  George."</p>

  <p>"If I ran away&mdash;Oh, well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Anybody ever tell you your hands are awful pretty?"</p>

  <p>She looked down at them, she pulled the lace of her sleeves over them, but
  otherwise she did not heed him. She was lost in unexpressed imaginings.</p>

  <p>Babbitt was too languid this evening to pursue his duty of being a
  captivating (though strictly moral) male. He ambled back to the
  bridge-tables. He was not much thrilled when Mrs. Frink, a small twittering
  woman, proposed that they "try and do some spiritualism and
  table-tipping&mdash;you know Chum can make the spirits come&mdash;honest, he
  just scares me!"</p>

  <p>The ladies of the party had not emerged all evening, but now, as the sex
  given to things of the spirit while the men warred against base things
  material, they took command and cried, "Oh, let's!" In the dimness the men
  were rather solemn and foolish, but the goodwives quivered and adored as they
  sat about the table. They laughed, "Now, you be good or I'll tell!" when the
  men took their hands in the circle.</p>

  <p>Babbitt tingled with a slight return of interest in life as Louetta
  Swanson's hand closed on his with quiet firmness.</p>

  <p>All of them hunched over, intent. They startled as some one drew a
  strained breath. In the dusty light from the hall they looked unreal, they
  felt disembodied. Mrs. Gunch squeaked, and they jumped with unnatural
  jocularity, but at Frink's hiss they sank into subdued awe. Suddenly,
  incredibly, they heard a knocking. They stared at Frink's half-revealed hands
  and found them lying still. They wriggled, and pretended not to be
  impressed.</p>

  <p>Frink spoke with gravity: "Is some one there?" A thud. "Is one knock to be
  the sign for 'yes'?" A thud. "And two for 'no'?" A thud.</p>

  <p>"Now, ladies and gentlemen, shall we ask the guide to put us into
  communication with the spirit of some great one passed over?" Frink
  mumbled.</p>

  <p>Mrs Orville Jones begged, "Oh, let's talk to Dante! We studied him at the
  Reading Circle. You know who he was, Orvy."</p>

  <p>"Certainly I know who he was! The Wop poet. Where do you think I was
  raised?" from her insulted husband.</p>

  <p>"Sure&mdash;the fellow that took the Cook's Tour to Hell. I've never waded
  through his po'try, but we learned about him in the U.," said Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"Page Mr. Dannnnnty!" intoned Eddie Swanson.</p>

  <p>"You ought to get him easy, Mr. Frink, you and he being fellow-poets,"
  said Louetta Swanson.</p>

  <p>"Fellow-poets, rats! Where d' you get that stuff?" protested Vergil Gunch.
  "I suppose Dante showed a lot of speed for an old-timer&mdash;not that I've
  actually read him, of course&mdash;but to come right down to hard facts, he
  wouldn't stand one-two-three if he had to buckle down to practical literature
  and turn out a poem for the newspaper-syndicate every day, like Chum
  does!"</p>

  <p>"That's so," from Eddie Swanson. "Those old birds could take their time.
  Judas Priest, I could write poetry myself if I had a whole year for it, and
  just wrote about that old-fashioned junk like Dante wrote about."</p>

  <p>Frink demanded, "Hush, now! I'll call him...O, Laughing Eyes, emerge forth
  into the, uh, the ultimates and bring hither the spirit of Dante, that we
  mortals may list to his words of wisdom."</p>

  <p>"You forgot to give um the address: 1658 Brimstone Avenue, Fiery Heights,
  Hell," Gunch chuckled, but the others felt that this was irreligious. And
  besides&mdash;"probably it was just Chum making the knocks, but still, if
  there did happen to be something to all this, be exciting to talk to an old
  fellow belonging to&mdash;way back in early times&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A thud. The spirit of Dante had come to the parlor of George F.
  Babbitt.</p>

  <p>He was, it seemed, quite ready to answer their questions. He was "glad to
  be with them, this evening."</p>

  <p>Frink spelled out the messages by running through the alphabet till the
  spirit interpreter knocked at the right letter.</p>

  <p>Littlefield asked, in a learned tone, "Do you like it in the Paradiso,
  Messire?"</p>

  <p>"We are very happy on the higher plane, Signor. We are glad that you are
  studying this great truth of spiritualism," Dante replied.</p>

  <p>The circle moved with an awed creaking of stays and shirt-fronts.
  "Suppose&mdash;suppose there were something to this?"</p>

  <p>Babbitt had a different worry. "Suppose Chum Frink was really one of these
  spiritualists! Chum had, for a literary fellow, always seemed to be a Regular
  Guy; he belonged to the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church and went to the
  Boosters' lunches and liked cigars and motors and racy stories. But suppose
  that secretly&mdash;After all, you never could tell about these darn
  highbrows; and to be an out-and-out spiritualist would be almost like being a
  socialist!"</p>

  <p>No one could long be serious in the presence of Vergil Gunch. "Ask Dant'
  how Jack Shakespeare and old Verg'&mdash;the guy they named after
  me&mdash;are gettin' along, and don't they wish they could get into the movie
  game!" he blared, and instantly all was mirth. Mrs. Jones shrieked, and Eddie
  Swanson desired to know whether Dante didn't catch cold with nothing on but
  his wreath.</p>

  <p>The pleased Dante made humble answer.</p>

  <p>But Babbitt&mdash;the curst discontent was torturing him again, and
  heavily, in the impersonal darkness, he pondered, "I don't&mdash;We're all so
  flip and think we're so smart. There'd be&mdash;A fellow like Dante&mdash;I
  wish I'd read some of his pieces. I don't suppose I ever will, now."</p>

  <p>He had, without explanation, the impression of a slaggy cliff and on it,
  in silhouette against menacing clouds, a lone and austere figure. He was
  dismayed by a sudden contempt for his surest friends. He grasped Louetta
  Swanson's hand, and found the comfort of human warmth. Habit came, a veteran
  warrior; and he shook himself. "What the deuce is the matter with me, this
  evening?"</p>

  <p>He patted Louetta's hand, to indicate that he hadn't meant anything
  improper by squeezing it, and demanded of Frink, "Say, see if you can get old
  Dant' to spiel us some of his poetry. Talk up to him. Tell him, '<i>Buena
  giorna, se&ntilde;or, com sa va, wie geht's? Keskersaykersa</i> a little pome,
  <i>se&ntilde;or?</i>'"</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">The lights were switched on; the women sat on the fronts of
  their chairs in that determined suspense whereby a wife indicates that as
  soon as the present speaker has finished, she is going to remark brightly to
  her husband, "Well, dear, I think per-<i>haps</i> it's about time for us to
  be saying good-night." For once Babbitt did not break out in blustering
  efforts to keep the party going. He had&mdash;there was something he wished
  to think out&mdash;But the psychical research had started them off again.
  ("Why didn't they go home! Why didn't they go home!") Though he was impressed
  by the profundity of the statement, he was only half-enthusiastic when Howard
  Littlefield lectured, "The United States is the only nation in which the
  government is a Moral Ideal and not just a social arrangement."
  ("True&mdash;true&mdash;weren't they <i>ever</i> going home?") He was usually
  delighted to have an "inside view" of the momentous world of motors but
  to-night he scarcely listened to Eddie Swanson's revelation: "If you want to
  go above the Javelin class, the Zeeco is a mighty good buy. Couple weeks ago,
  and mind you, this was a fair, square test, they took a Zeeco stock
  touring-car and they slid up the Tonawanda hill on high, and fellow told
  me&mdash;" ("Zeeco good boat but&mdash;Were they planning to stay all
  night?")</p>

  <p>They really were going, with a flutter of "We did have the best time!"</p>

  <p>Most aggressively friendly of all was Babbitt, yet as he burbled he was
  reflecting, "I got through it, but for a while there I didn't hardly think
  I'd last out." He prepared to taste that most delicate pleasure of the host:
  making fun of his guests in the relaxation of midnight. As the door closed he
  yawned voluptuously, chest out, shoulders wriggling, and turned cynically to
  his wife.</p>

  <p>She was beaming. "Oh, it was nice, wasn't it! I know they enjoyed every
  minute of it. Don't you think so?"</p>

  <p>He couldn't do it. He couldn't mock. It would have been like sneering at a
  happy child. He lied ponderously: "You bet! Best party this year, by a long
  shot."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't the dinner good! And honestly I thought the fried chicken was
  delicious!"</p>

  <p>"You bet! Fried to the Queen's taste. Best fried chicken I've tasted for a
  coon's age."</p>

  <p>"Didn't Matilda fry it beautifully! And don't you think the soup was
  simply delicious?"</p>

  <p>"It certainly was! It was corking! Best soup I've tasted since Heck was a
  pup!" But his voice was seeping away. They stood in the hall, under the
  electric light in its square box-like shade of red glass bound with nickel.
  She stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Why, George, you don't sound&mdash;you sound as if you hadn't really
  enjoyed it."</p>

  <p>"Sure I did! Course I did!"</p>

  <p>"George! What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm kind of tired, I guess. Been pounding pretty hard at the office.
  Need to get away and rest up a little."</p>

  <p>"Well, we're going to Maine in just a few weeks now, dear." "Yuh&mdash;"
  Then he was pouring it out nakedly, robbed of reticence. "Myra: I think it'd
  be a good thing for me to get up there early."</p>

  <p>"But you have this man you have to meet in New York about business."</p>

  <p>"What man? Oh, sure. Him. Oh, that's all off. But I want to hit Maine
  early&mdash;get in a little fishing, catch me a big trout, by golly!" A
  nervous, artificial laugh.</p>

  <p>"Well, why don't we do it? Verona and Matilda can run the house between
  them, and you and I can go any time, if you think we can afford it."</p>

  <p>"But that's&mdash;I've been feeling so jumpy lately, I thought maybe it
  might be a good thing if I kind of got off by myself and sweat it out of
  me."</p>

  <p>"George! Don't you <i>want</i> me to go along?" She was too wretchedly in
  earnest to be tragic, or gloriously insulted, or anything save dumpy and
  defenseless and flushed to the red steaminess of a boiled beet.</p>

  <p>"Of course I do! I just meant&mdash;" Remembering that Paul Riesling had
  predicted this, he was as desperate as she. "I mean, sometimes it's a good
  thing for an old grouch like me to go off and get it out of his system." He
  tried to sound paternal. "Then when you and the kids arrive&mdash;I figured
  maybe I might skip up to Maine just a few days ahead of you&mdash;I'd be
  ready for a real bat, see how I mean?" He coaxed her with large booming
  sounds, with affable smiles, like a popular preacher blessing an Easter
  congregation, like a humorous lecturer completing his stint of eloquence,
  like all perpetrators of masculine wiles.</p>

  <p>She stared at him, the joy of festival drained from her face. "Do I bother
  you when we go on vacations? Don't I add anything to your fun?"</p>

  <p>He broke. Suddenly, dreadfully, he was hysterical, he was a yelping baby.
  "Yes, yes, yes! Hell, yes! But can't you understand I'm shot to pieces? I'm
  all in! I got to take care of myself! I tell you, I got to&mdash;I'm sick of
  everything and everybody! I got to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was she who was mature and protective now. "Why, of course! You shall
  run off by yourself! Why don't you get Paul to go along, and you boys just
  fish and have a good time?" She patted his shoulder&mdash;reaching up to
  it&mdash;while he shook with palsied helplessness, and in that moment was not
  merely by habit fond of her but clung to her strength.</p>

  <p>She cried cheerily, "Now up-stairs you go, and pop into bed. We'll fix it
  all up. I'll see to the doors. Now skip!"</p>

  <p>For many minutes, for many hours, for a bleak eternity, he lay awake,
  shivering, reduced to primitive terror, comprehending that he had won
  freedom, and wondering what he could do with anything so unknown and so
  embarrassing as freedom.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">No apartment-house in Zenith had more resolutely
  experimented in condensation than the Revelstoke Arms, in which Paul and
  Zilla Riesling had a flat. By sliding the beds into low closets the bedrooms
  were converted into living-rooms. The kitchens were cupboards each containing
  an electric range, a copper sink, a glass refrigerator, and, very
  intermittently, a Balkan maid. Everything about the Arms was excessively
  modern, and everything was compressed&mdash;except the garages.</p>

  <p>The Babbitts were calling on the Rieslings at the Arms. It was a
  speculative venture to call on the Rieslings; interesting and sometimes
  disconcerting. Zilla was an active, strident, full-blown, high-bosomed
  blonde. When she condescended to be good-humored she was nervously amusing.
  Her comments on people were saltily satiric and penetrative of accepted
  hypocrisies. "That's so!" you said, and looked sheepish. She danced wildly,
  and called on the world to be merry, but in the midst of it she would turn
  indignant. She was always becoming indignant. Life was a plot against her and
  she exposed it furiously.</p>

  <p>She was affable to-night. She merely hinted that Orville Jones wore a
  toupe, that Mrs. T. Cholmondeley Frink's singing resembled a Ford going into
  high, and that the Hon. Otis Deeble, mayor of Zenith and candidate for
  Congress, was a flatulent fool (which was quite true). The Babbitts and
  Rieslings sat doubtfully on stone-hard brocade chairs in the small
  living-room of the flat, with its mantel unprovided with a fireplace, and its
  strip of heavy gilt fabric upon a glaring new player-piano, till Mrs.
  Riesling shrieked, "Come on! Let's put some pep in it! Get out your fiddle,
  Paul, and I'll try to make Georgie dance decently."</p>

  <p>The Babbitts were in earnest. They were plotting for the escape to Maine.
  But when Mrs. Babbitt hinted with plump smilingness, "Does Paul get as tired
  after the winter's work as Georgie does?" then Zilla remembered an injury;
  and when Zilla Riesling remembered an injury the world stopped till something
  had been done about it.</p>

  <p>"Does he get tired? No, he doesn't get tired, he just goes crazy, that's
  all! You think Paul is so reasonable, oh, yes, and he loves to make out he's
  a little lamb, but he's stubborn as a mule. Oh, if you had to live with
  him&mdash;! You'd find out how sweet he is! He just pretends to be meek so he
  can have his own way. And me, I get the credit for being a terrible old
  crank, but if I didn't blow up once in a while and get something started,
  we'd die of dry-rot. He never wants to go any place and&mdash;Why, last
  evening, just because the car was out of order&mdash;and that was his fault,
  too, because he ought to have taken it to the service-station and had the
  battery looked at&mdash;and he didn't want to go down to the movies on the
  trolley. But we went, and then there was one of those impudent conductors,
  and Paul wouldn't do a thing.</p>

  <p>"I was standing on the platform waiting for the people to let me into the
  car, and this beast, this conductor, hollered at me, 'Come on, you, move up!'
  Why, I've never had anybody speak to me that way in all my life! I was so
  astonished I just turned to him and said&mdash;I thought there must be some
  mistake, and so I said to him, perfectly pleasant, 'Were you speaking to me?'
  and he went on and bellowed at me, 'Yes, I was! You're keeping the whole car
  from starting!' he said, and then I saw he was one of these dirty ill-bred
  hogs that kindness is wasted on, and so I stopped and looked right at him,
  and I said, 'I&mdash;beg&mdash;your&mdash;pardon, I am not doing anything of
  the kind,' I said, 'it's the people ahead of me, who won't move up,' I said,
  'and furthermore, let me tell you, young man, that you're a low-down,
  foul-mouthed, impertinent skunk,' I said, 'and you're no gentleman! I
  certainly intend to report you, and we'll see,' I said, 'whether a lady is to
  be insulted by any drunken bum that chooses to put on a ragged uniform, and
  I'd thank you,' I said, 'to keep your filthy abuse to yourself.' And then I
  waited for Paul to show he was half a man and come to my defense, and he just
  stood there and pretended he hadn't heard a word, and so I said to him,
  'Well,' I said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, cut it, cut it, Zill!" Paul groaned. "We all know I'm a mollycoddle,
  and you're a tender bud, and let's let it go at that."</p>

  <p>"Let it go?" Zilla's face was wrinkled like the Medusa, her voice was a
  dagger of corroded brass. She was full of the joy of righteousness and bad
  temper. She was a crusader and, like every crusader, she exulted in the
  opportunity to be vicious in the name of virtue. "Let it go? If people knew
  how many things I've let go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, quit being such a bully."</p>

  <p>"Yes, a fine figure you'd cut if I didn't bully you! You'd lie abed till
  noon and play your idiotic fiddle till midnight! You're born lazy, and you're
  born shiftless, and you're born cowardly, Paul Riesling&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, now, don't say that, Zilla; you don't mean a word of it!" protested
  Mrs. Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"I will say that, and I mean every single last word of it!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, now, Zilla, the idea!" Mrs. Babbitt was maternal and fussy. She was
  no older than Zilla, but she seemed so&mdash;at first. She was placid and
  puffy and mature, where Zilla, at forty-five, was so bleached and
  tight-corseted that you knew only that she was older than she looked. "The
  idea of talking to poor Paul like that!"</p>

  <p>"Poor Paul is right! We'd both be poor, we'd be in the poorhouse, if I
  didn't jazz him up!"</p>

  <p>"Why, now, Zilla, Georgie and I were just saying how hard Paul's been
  working all year, and we were thinking it would be lovely if the Boys could
  run off by themselves. I've been coaxing George to go up to Maine ahead of
  the rest of us, and get the tired out of his system before we come, and I
  think it would be lovely if Paul could manage to get away and join him."</p>

  <p>At this exposure of his plot to escape, Paul was startled out of
  impassivity. He rubbed his fingers. His hands twitched.</p>

  <p>Zilla bayed, "Yes! You're lucky! You can let George go, and not have to
  watch him. Fat old Georgie! Never peeps at another woman! Hasn't got the
  spunk!"</p>

  <p>"The hell I haven't!" Babbitt was fervently defending his priceless
  immorality when Paul interrupted him&mdash;and Paul looked dangerous. He rose
  quickly; he said gently to Zilla:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you imply I have a lot of sweethearts."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do!"</p>

  <p>"Well, then, my dear, since you ask for it&mdash;There hasn't been a time
  in the last ten years when I haven't found some nice little girl to comfort
  me, and as long as you continue your amiability I shall probably continue to
  deceive you. It isn't hard. You're so stupid."</p>

  <p>Zilla gibbered; she howled; words could not be distinguished in her slaver
  of abuse.</p>

  <p>Then the bland George F. Babbitt was transformed. If Paul was dangerous,
  if Zilla was a snake-locked fury, if the neat emotions suitable to the
  Revelstoke Arms had been slashed into raw hatreds, it was Babbitt who was the
  most formidable. He leaped up. He seemed very large. He seized Zilla's
  shoulder. The cautions of the broker were wiped from his face, and his voice
  was cruel:</p>

  <p>"I've had enough of all this damn nonsense! I've known you for twenty-five
  years, Zil, and I never knew you to miss a chance to take your
  disappointments out on Paul. You're not wicked. You're worse. You're a fool.
  And let me tell you that Paul is the finest boy God ever made. Every decent
  person is sick and tired of your taking advantage of being a woman and
  springing every mean innuendo you can think of. Who the hell are you that a
  person like Paul should have to ask your <i>permission</i> to go with me? You
  act like you were a combination of Queen Victoria and Cleopatra. You fool,
  can't you see how people snicker at you, and sneer at you?"</p>

  <p>Zilla was sobbing, "I've never&mdash;I've never&mdash;nobody ever talked
  to me like this in all my life!"</p>

  <p>"No, but that's the way they talk behind your back! Always! They say
  you're a scolding old woman. Old, by God!"</p>

  <p>That cowardly attack broke her. Her eyes were blank. She wept. But Babbitt
  glared stolidly. He felt that he was the all-powerful official in charge;
  that Paul and Mrs. Babbitt looked on him with awe; that he alone could handle
  this case.</p>

  <p>Zilla writhed. She begged, "Oh, they don't!"</p>

  <p>"They certainly do!"</p>

  <p>"I've been a bad woman! I'm terribly sorry! I'll kill myself! I'll do
  anything. Oh, I'll&mdash;What do you want?"</p>

  <p>She abased herself completely. Also, she enjoyed it. To the connoisseur of
  scenes, nothing is more enjoyable than a thorough, melodramatic, egoistic
  humility.</p>

  <p>"I want you to let Paul beat it off to Maine with me," Babbitt
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"How can I help his going? You've just said I was an idiot and nobody paid
  any attention to me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you can help it, all right, all right! What you got to do is to cut
  out hinting that the minute he gets out of your sight, he'll go chasing after
  some petticoat. Matter fact, that's the way you start the boy off wrong. You
  ought to have more sense&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I will, honestly, I will, George. I know I was bad. Oh, forgive me,
  all of you, forgive me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She enjoyed it.</p>

  <p>So did Babbitt. He condemned magnificently and forgave piously, and as he
  went parading out with his wife he was grandly explanatory to her:</p>

  <p>"Kind of a shame to bully Zilla, but course it was the only way to handle
  her. Gosh, I certainly did have her crawling!"</p>

  <p>She said calmly, "Yes. You were horrid. You were showing off. You were
  having a lovely time thinking what a great fine person you were!"</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly! Can you beat it! Of course I might of expected you to not
  stand by me! I might of expected you'd stick up for your own sex!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Poor Zilla, she's so unhappy. She takes it out on Paul. She hasn't a
  single thing to do, in that little flat. And she broods too much. And she
  used to be so pretty and gay, and she resents losing it. And you were just as
  nasty and mean as you could be. I'm not a bit proud of you&mdash;or of Paul,
  boasting about his horrid love-affairs!"</p>

  <p>He was sulkily silent; he maintained his bad temper at a high level of
  outraged nobility all the four blocks home. At the door he left her, in
  self-approving haughtiness, and tramped the lawn.</p>

  <p>With a shock it was revealed to him: "Gosh, I wonder if she was
  right&mdash;if she was partly right?" Overwork must have flayed him to
  abnormal sensitiveness; it was one of the few times in his life when he had
  queried his eternal excellence; and he perceived the summer night, smelled
  the wet grass. Then: "I don't care! I've pulled it off. We're going to have
  our spree. And for Paul, I'd do anything."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">They were buying their Maine tackle at Ijams Brothers', the
  Sporting Goods Mart, with the help of Willis Ijams, fellow member of the
  Boosters' Club. Babbitt was completely mad. He trumpeted and danced. He
  muttered to Paul, "Say, this is pretty good, eh? To be buying the stuff, eh?
  And good old Willis Ijams himself coming down on the floor to wait on us!
  Say, if those fellows that are getting their kit for the North Lakes knew we
  were going clear up to Maine, they'd have a fit, eh?...Well, come on, Brother
  Ijams&mdash;Willis, I mean. Here's your chance! We're a couple of easy marks!
  Whee! Let me at it! I'm going to buy out the store!"</p>

  <p>He gloated on fly-rods and gorgeous rubber hip-boots, on tents with
  celluloid windows and folding chairs and ice-boxes. He simple-heartedly
  wanted to buy all of them. It was the Paul whom he was always vaguely
  protecting who kept him from his drunken desires.</p>

  <p>But even Paul lightened when Willis Ijams, a salesman with poetry and
  diplomacy, discussed flies. "Now, of course, you boys know." he said, "the
  great scrap is between dry flies and wet flies. Personally, I'm for dry
  flies. More sporting."</p>

  <p>"That's so. Lots more sporting," fulminated Babbitt, who knew very little
  about flies either wet or dry.</p>

  <p>"Now if you'll take my advice, Georgie, you'll stock up well on these pale
  evening dims, and silver sedges, and red ants. Oh, boy, there's a fly, that
  red ant!"</p>

  <p>"You bet! That's what it is&mdash;a fly!" rejoiced Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, that red ant," said Ijams, "is a real honest-to-God
  <i>fly</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I guess ole Mr. Trout won't come a-hustling when I drop one of those
  red ants on the water!" asserted Babbitt, and his thick wrists made a
  rapturous motion of casting.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and the landlocked salmon will take it, too," said Ijams, who had
  never seen a landlocked salmon.</p>

  <p>"Salmon! Trout! Say, Paul, can you see Uncle George with his khaki pants
  on haulin' 'em in, some morning 'bout seven? Whee!"</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">They were on the New York express, incredibly bound for
  Maine, incredibly without their families. They were free, in a man's world,
  in the smoking-compartment of the Pullman.</p>

  <p>Outside the car window was a glaze of darkness stippled with the gold of
  infrequent mysterious lights. Babbitt was immensely conscious, in the sway
  and authoritative clatter of the train, of going, of going on. Leaning toward
  Paul he grunted, "Gosh, pretty nice to be hiking, eh?"</p>

  <p>The small room, with its walls of ocher-colored steel, was filled mostly
  with the sort of men he classified as the Best Fellows You'll Ever
  Meet&mdash;Real Good Mixers. There were four of them on the long seat; a fat
  man with a shrewd fat face, a knife-edged man in a green velour hat, a very
  young young man with an imitation amber cigarette-holder, and Babbitt. Facing
  them, on two movable leather chairs, were Paul and a lanky, old-fashioned
  man, very cunning, with wrinkles bracketing his mouth. They all read
  newspapers or trade journals, boot-and-shoe journals, crockery journals, and
  waited for the joys of conversation. It was the very young man, now making
  his first journey by Pullman, who began it.</p>

  <p>"Say, gee, I had a wild old time in Zenith!" he gloried. "Say, if a fellow
  knows the ropes there he can have as wild a time as he can in New York!"</p>

  <p>"Yuh, I bet you simply raised the old Ned. I figured you were a bad man
  when I saw you get on the train!" chuckled the fat one.</p>

  <p>The others delightedly laid down their papers.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all right now! I guess I seen some things in the Arbor you
  never seen!" complained the boy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll bet you did! I bet you lapped up the malted milk like a reg'lar
  little devil!"</p>

  <p>Then, the boy having served as introduction, they ignored him and charged
  into real talk. Only Paul, sitting by himself, reading at a serial story in a
  newspaper, failed to join them and all but Babbitt regarded him as a snob, an
  eccentric, a person of no spirit.</p>

  <p>Which of them said which has never been determined, and does not matter,
  since they all had the same ideas and expressed them always with the same
  ponderous and brassy assurance. If it was not Babbitt who was delivering any
  given verdict, at least he was beaming on the chancellor who did deliver
  it.</p>

  <p>"At that, though," announced the first "they're selling quite some booze
  in Zenith. Guess they are everywhere. I don't know how you fellows feel about
  prohibition, but the way it strikes me is that it's a mighty beneficial thing
  for the poor zob that hasn't got any will-power but for fellows like us, it's
  an infringement of personal liberty."</p>

  <p>"That's a fact. Congress has got no right to interfere with a fellow's
  personal liberty," contended the second.</p>

  <p>A man came in from the car, but as all the seats were full he stood up
  while he smoked his cigarette. He was an Outsider; he was not one of the Old
  Families of the smoking-compartment. They looked upon him bleakly and, after
  trying to appear at ease by examining his chin in the mirror, he gave it up
  and went out in silence.</p>

  <p>"Just been making a trip through the South. Business conditions not very
  good down there," said one of the council.</p>

  <p>"Is that a fact! Not very good, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No, didn't strike me they were up to normal."</p>

  <p>"Not up to normal, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No, I wouldn't hardly say they were."</p>

  <p>The whole council nodded sagely and decided, "Yump, not hardly up to
  snuff."</p>

  <p>"Well, business conditions ain't what they ought to be out West, neither,
  not by a long shot."</p>

  <p>"That's a fact. And I guess the hotel business feels it. That's one good
  thing, though: these hotels that've been charging five bucks a day&mdash;yes,
  and maybe six&mdash;seven!&mdash;for a rotten room are going to be darn glad
  to get four, and maybe give you a little service."</p>

  <p>"That's a fact. Say, uh, speaknubout hotels, I hit the St. Francis at San
  Francisco for the first time, the other day, and, say, it certainly is a
  first-class place."</p>

  <p>"You're right, brother! The St. Francis is a swell place&mdash;absolutely
  A1."</p>

  <p>"That's a fact. I'm right with you. It's a first-class place."</p>

  <p>"Yuh, but say, any of you fellows ever stay at the Rippleton, in Chicago?
  I don't want to knock&mdash;I believe in boosting wherever you can&mdash;but
  say, of all the rotten dumps that pass 'emselves off as first-class hotels,
  that's the worst. I'm going to get those guys, one of these days, and I told
  'em so. You know how I am&mdash;well, maybe you don't know, but I'm
  accustomed to first-class accommodations, and I'm perfectly willing to pay a
  reasonable price. I got into Chicago late the other night, and the
  Rippleton's near the station&mdash;I'd never been there before, but I says to
  the taxi-driver&mdash;I always believe in taking a taxi when you get in late;
  may cost a little more money, but, gosh, it's worth it when you got to be up
  early next morning and out selling a lot of crabs&mdash;and I said to him,
  'Oh, just drive me over to the Rippleton.'</p>

  <p>"Well, we got there, and I breezed up to the desk and said to the clerk,
  'Well, brother, got a nice room with bath for Cousin Bill?' Saaaay! You'd 'a'
  thought I'd sold him a second, or asked him to work on Yom Kippur! He hands
  me the cold-boiled stare and yaps, 'I dunno, friend, I'll see,' and he ducks
  behind the rigamajig they keep track of the rooms on. Well, I guess he called
  up the Credit Association and the American Security League to see if I was
  all right&mdash;he certainly took long enough&mdash;or maybe he just went to
  sleep; but finally he comes out and looks at me like it hurts him, and
  croaks, 'I think I can let you have a room with bath.' 'Well, that's awful
  nice of you&mdash;sorry to trouble you&mdash;how much 'll it set me back?' I
  says, real sweet. 'It'll cost you seven bucks a day, friend,' he says.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was late, and anyway, it went down on my
  expense-account&mdash;gosh, if I'd been paying it instead of the firm, I'd
  'a' tramped the streets all night before I'd 'a' let any hick tavern stick me
  seven great big round dollars, believe me! So I lets it go at that. Well, the
  clerk wakes a nice young bell hop&mdash;fine lad&mdash;not a day over
  seventy-nine years old&mdash;fought at the Battle of Gettysburg and doesn't
  know it's over yet&mdash;thought I was one of the Confederates, I guess, from
  the way he looked at me&mdash;and Rip van Winkle took me up to
  something&mdash;I found out afterwards they called it a room, but first I
  thought there'd been some mistake&mdash;I thought they were putting me in the
  Salvation Army collection-box! At seven per each and every diem! Gosh!"</p>

  <p>"Yuh, I've heard the Rippleton was pretty cheesy. Now, when I go to
  Chicago I always stay at the Blackstone or the La Salle&mdash;first-class
  places."</p>

  <p>"Say, any of you fellows ever stay at the Birchdale at Terre Haute? How is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the Birchdale is a first-class hotel."</p>

  <p>(Twelve minutes of conference on the state of hotels in South Bend, Flint,
  Dayton, Tulsa, Wichita, Fort Worth, Winona, Erie, Fargo, and Moose Jaw.)</p>

  <p>"Speaknubout prices," the man in the velour hat observed, fingering the
  elk-tooth on his heavy watch-chain, "I'd like to know where they get this
  stuff about clothes coming down. Now, you take this suit I got on." He
  pinched his trousers-leg. "Four years ago I paid forty-two fifty for it, and
  it was real sure-'nough value. Well, here the other day I went into a store
  back home and asked to see a suit, and the fellow yanks out some
  hand-me-downs that, honest, I wouldn't put on a hired man. Just out of
  curiosity I asks him, 'What you charging for that junk?' 'Junk,' he says,
  'what d' you mean junk? That's a swell piece of goods, all wool&mdash;' Like
  hell! It was nice vegetable wool, right off the Ole Plantation! 'It's all
  wool,' he says, 'and we get sixty-seven ninety for it.' 'Oh, you do, do you!'
  I says. 'Not from me you don't,' I says, and I walks right out on him. You
  bet! I says to the wife, 'Well,' I said, 'as long as your strength holds out
  and you can go on putting a few more patches on papa's pants, we'll just pass
  up buying clothes."'</p>

  <p>"That's right, brother. And just look at collars, frinstance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hey! Wait!" the fat man protested. "What's the matter with collars? I'm
  selling collars! D' you realize the cost of labor on collars is still two
  hundred and seven per cent. above&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They voted that if their old friend the fat man sold collars, then the
  price of collars was exactly what it should be; but all other clothing was
  tragically too expensive. They admired and loved one another now. They went
  profoundly into the science of business, and indicated that the purpose of
  manufacturing a plow or a brick was so that it might be sold. To them, the
  Romantic Hero was no longer the knight, the wandering poet, the cowpuncher,
  the aviator, nor the brave young district attorney, but the great
  sales-manager, who had an Analysis of Merchandizing Problems on his
  glass-topped desk, whose title of nobility was "Go-getter," and who devoted
  himself and all his young samurai to the cosmic purpose of Selling&mdash;not
  of selling anything in particular, for or to anybody in particular, but pure
  Selling.</p>

  <p>The shop-talk roused Paul Riesling. Though he was a player of violins and
  an interestingly unhappy husband, he was also a very able salesman of
  tar-roofing. He listened to the fat man's remarks on "the value of
  house-organs and bulletins as a method of jazzing-up the Boys out on the
  road;" and he himself offered one or two excellent thoughts on the use of
  two-cent stamps on circulars. Then he committed an offense against the holy
  law of the Clan of Good Fellows. He became highbrow.</p>

  <p>They were entering a city. On the outskirts they passed a steel-mill which
  flared in scarlet and orange flame that licked at the cadaverous stacks, at
  the iron-sheathed walls and sullen converters.</p>

  <p>"My Lord, look at that&mdash;beautiful!" said Paul.</p>

  <p>"You bet it's beautiful, friend. That's the Shelling-Horton Steel Plant,
  and they tell me old John Shelling made a good three million bones out of
  munitions during the war!" the man with the velour hat said reverently.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean&mdash;I mean it's lovely the way the light pulls that
  picturesque yard, all littered with junk, right out of the darkness," said
  Paul.</p>

  <p>They stared at him, while Babbitt crowed, "Paul there has certainly got
  one great little eye for picturesque places and quaint sights and all that
  stuff. 'D of been an author or something if he hadn't gone into the roofing
  line."</p>

  <p>Paul looked annoyed. (Babbitt sometimes wondered if Paul appreciated his
  loyal boosting.) The man in the velour hat grunted, "Well, personally, I
  think Shelling-Horton keep their works awful dirty. Bum routing. But I don't
  suppose there's any law against calling 'em 'picturesque' if it gets you that
  way!"</p>

  <p>Paul sulkily returned to his newspaper and the conversation logically
  moved on to trains.</p>

  <p>"What time do we get into Pittsburg?" asked Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"Pittsburg? I think we get in at&mdash;no, that was last year's
  schedule&mdash;wait a minute&mdash;let's see&mdash;got a time-table right
  here."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if we're on time?"</p>

  <p>"Yuh, sure, we must be just about on time."</p>

  <p>"No, we aren't&mdash;we were seven minutes late, last station."</p>

  <p>"Were we? Straight? Why, gosh, I thought we were right on time."</p>

  <p>"No, we're about seven minutes late."</p>

  <p>"Yuh, that's right; seven minutes late."</p>

  <p>The porter entered&mdash;a negro in white jacket with brass buttons.</p>

  <p>"How late are we, George?" growled the fat man.</p>

  <p>"'Deed, I don't know, sir. I think we're about on time," said the porter,
  folding towels and deftly tossing them up on the rack above the washbowls.
  The council stared at him gloomily and when he was gone they wailed:</p>

  <p>"I don't know what's come over these niggers, nowadays. They never give
  you a civil answer."</p>

  <p>"That's a fact. They're getting so they don't have a single bit of respect
  for you. The old-fashioned coon was a fine old cuss&mdash;he knew his
  place&mdash;but these young dinges don't want to be porters or
  cotton-pickers. Oh, no! They got to be lawyers and professors and Lord knows
  what all! I tell you, it's becoming a pretty serious problem. We ought to get
  together and show the black man, yes, and the yellow man, his place. Now, I
  haven't got one particle of race-prejudice. I'm the first to be glad when a
  nigger succeeds&mdash;so long as he stays where he belongs and doesn't try to
  usurp the rightful authority and business ability of the white man."</p>

  <p>"That's the i.! And another thing we got to do," said the man with the
  velour hat (whose name was Koplinsky), "is to keep these damn foreigners out
  of the country. Thank the Lord, we're putting a limit on immigration. These
  Dagoes and Hunkies have got to learn that this is a white man's country, and
  they ain't wanted here. When we've assimilated the foreigners we got here now
  and learned 'em the principles of Americanism and turned 'em into regular
  folks, why then maybe we'll let in a few more."</p>

  <p>"You bet. That's a fact," they observed, and passed on to lighter topics.
  They rapidly reviewed motor-car prices, tire-mileage, oil-stocks, fishing,
  and the prospects for the wheat-crop in Dakota.</p>

  <p>But the fat man was impatient at this waste of time. He was a veteran
  traveler and free of illusions. Already he had asserted that he was "an old
  he-one." He leaned forward, gathered in their attention by his expression of
  sly humor, and grumbled, "Oh, hell, boys, let's cut out the formality and get
  down to the stories!"</p>

  <p>They became very lively and intimate.</p>

  <p>Paul and the boy vanished. The others slid forward on the long seat,
  unbuttoned their vests, thrust their feet up on the chairs, pulled the
  stately brass cuspidors nearer, and ran the green window-shade down on its
  little trolley, to shut them in from the uncomfortable strangeness of night.
  After each bark of laughter they cried, "Say, jever hear the one
  about&mdash;" Babbitt was expansive and virile. When the train stopped at an
  important station, the four men walked up and down the cement platform, under
  the vast smoky train-shed roof, like a stormy sky, under the elevated
  footways, beside crates of ducks and sides of beef, in the mystery of an
  unknown city. They strolled abreast, old friends and well content. At the
  long-drawn "Alllll aboarrrrrd"&mdash;like a mountain call at dusk&mdash;they
  hastened back into the smoking-compartment, and till two of the morning
  continued the droll tales, their eyes damp with cigar-smoke and laughter.
  When they parted they shook hands, and chuckled, "Well, sir, it's been a
  great session. Sorry to bust it up. Mighty glad to met you."</p>

  <p>Babbitt lay awake in the close hot tomb of his Pullman berth, shaking with
  remembrance of the fat man's limerick about the lady who wished to be wild.
  He raised the shade; he lay with a puffy arm tucked between his head and the
  skimpy pillow, looking out on the sliding silhouettes of trees, and village
  lamps like exclamation-points. He was very happy.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">They had four hours in New York between trains. The one
  thing Babbitt wished to see was the Pennsylvania Hotel, which had been built
  since his last visit. He stared up at it, muttering, "Twenty-two hundred
  rooms and twenty-two hundred baths! That's got everything in the world beat.
  Lord, their turnover must be&mdash;well, suppose price of rooms is four to
  eight dollars a day, and I suppose maybe some ten and&mdash;four times
  twenty-two hundred-say six times twenty-two hundred&mdash;well, anyway, with
  restaurants and everything, say summers between eight and fifteen thousand a
  day. Every day! I never thought I'd see a thing like that! Some town! Of
  course the average fellow in Zenith has got more Individual Initiative than
  the fourflushers here, but I got to hand it to New York. Yes, sir, town,
  you're all right&mdash;some ways. Well, old Paulski, I guess we've seen
  everything that's worth while. How'll we kill the rest of the time?
  Movie?"</p>

  <p>But Paul desired to see a liner. "Always wanted to go to Europe&mdash;and,
  by thunder, I will, too, some day before I past out," he sighed.</p>

  <p>From a rough wharf on the North River they stared at the stern of the
  Aquitania and her stacks and wireless antenna lifted above the dock-house
  which shut her in.</p>

  <p>"By golly," Babbitt droned, "wouldn't be so bad to go over to the Old
  Country and take a squint at all these ruins, and the place where Shakespeare
  was born. And think of being able to order a drink whenever you wanted one!
  Just range up to a bar and holler out loud, 'Gimme a cocktail, and darn the
  police!' Not bad at all. What juh like to see, over there, Paulibus?"</p>

  <p>Paul did not answer. Babbitt turned. Paul was standing with clenched
  fists, head drooping, staring at the liner as in terror. His thin body, seen
  against the summer-glaring planks of the wharf, was childishly meager.</p>

  <p>Again, "What would you hit for on the other side, Paul?"</p>

  <p>Scowling at the steamer, his breast heaving, Paul whispered, "Oh, my God!"
  While Babbitt watched him anxiously he snapped, "Come on, let's get out of
  this," and hastened down the wharf, not looking back.</p>

  <p>"That's funny," considered Babbitt. "The boy didn't care for seeing the
  ocean boats after all. I thought he'd be interested in 'em."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Though he exulted, and made sage speculations about
  locomotive horse-power, as their train climbed the Maine mountain-ridge and
  from the summit he looked down the shining way among the pines; though he
  remarked, "Well, by golly!" when he discovered that the station at
  Katadumcook, the end of the line, was an aged freight-car; Babbitt's moment
  of impassioned release came when they sat on a tiny wharf on Lake Sunasquam,
  awaiting the launch from the hotel. A raft had floated down the lake; between
  the logs and the shore, the water was transparent, thin-looking, flashing
  with minnows. A guide in black felt hat with trout-flies in the band, and
  flannel shirt of a peculiarly daring blue, sat on a log and whittled and was
  silent. A dog, a good country dog, black and woolly gray, a dog rich in
  leisure and in meditation, scratched and grunted and slept. The thick
  sunlight was lavish on the bright water, on the rim of gold-green balsam
  boughs, the silver birches and tropic ferns, and across the lake it burned on
  the sturdy shoulders of the mountains. Over everything was a holy peace.</p>

  <p>Silent, they loafed on the edge of the wharf, swinging their legs above
  the water. The immense tenderness of the place sank into Babbitt, and he
  murmured, "I'd just like to sit here&mdash;the rest of my life&mdash;and
  whittle&mdash;and sit. And never hear a typewriter. Or Stan Graff fussing in
  the 'phone. Or Rone and Ted scrapping. Just sit. Gosh!"</p>

  <p>He patted Paul's shoulder. "How does it strike you, old snoozer?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's darn good, Georgie. There's something sort of eternal about
  it."</p>

  <p>For once, Babbitt understood him.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Their launch rounded the bend; at the head of the lake,
  under a mountain slope, they saw the little central dining-shack of their
  hotel and the crescent of squat log cottages which served as bedrooms. They
  landed, and endured the critical examination of the habitues who had been at
  the hotel for a whole week. In their cottage, with its high stone fireplace,
  they hastened, as Babbitt expressed it, to "get into some regular he-togs."
  They came out; Paul in an old gray suit and soft white shirt; Babbitt in
  khaki shirt and vast and flapping khaki trousers. It was excessively new
  khaki; his rimless spectacles belonged to a city office; and his face was not
  tanned but a city pink. He made a discordant noise in the place. But with
  infinite satisfaction he slapped his legs and crowed, "Say, this is getting
  back home, eh?"</p>

  <p>They stood on the wharf before the hotel. He winked at Paul and drew from
  his back pocket a plug of chewing-tobacco, a vulgarism forbidden in the
  Babbitt home. He took a chew, beaming and wagging his head as he tugged at
  it. "Um! Um! Maybe I haven't been hungry for a wad of eating-tobacco! Have
  some?"</p>

  <p>They looked at each other in a grin of understanding. Paul took the plug,
  gnawed at it. They stood quiet, their jaws working. They solemnly spat, one
  after the other, into the placid water. They stretched voluptuously, with
  lifted arms and arched backs. From beyond the mountains came the shuffling
  sound of a far-off train. A trout leaped, and fell back in a silver circle.
  They sighed together.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">They had a week before their families came. Each evening
  they planned to get up early and fish before breakfast. Each morning they lay
  abed till the breakfast-bell, pleasantly conscious that there were no
  efficient wives to rouse them. The mornings were cold; the fire was kindly as
  they dressed.</p>

  <p>Paul was distressingly clean, but Babbitt reveled in a good sound
  dirtiness, in not having to shave till his spirit was moved to it. He
  treasured every grease spot and fish-scale on his new khaki trousers.</p>

  <p>All morning they fished unenergetically, or tramped the dim and
  aqueous-lighted trails among rank ferns and moss sprinkled with crimson
  bells. They slept all afternoon, and till midnight played stud-poker with the
  guides. Poker was a serious business to the guides. They did not gossip; they
  shuffled the thick greasy cards with a deft ferocity menacing to the
  "sports;" and Joe Paradise, king of guides, was sarcastic to loiterers who
  halted the game even to scratch.</p>

  <p>At midnight, as Paul and he blundered to their cottage over the pungent
  wet grass, and pine-roots confusing in the darkness, Babbitt rejoiced that he
  did not have to explain to his wife where he had been all evening.</p>

  <p>They did not talk much. The nervous loquacity and opinionation of the
  Zenith Athletic Club dropped from them. But when they did talk they slipped
  into the naive intimacy of college days. Once they drew their canoe up to the
  bank of Sunasquam Water, a stream walled in by the dense green of the
  hardhack. The sun roared on the green jungle but in the shade was sleepy
  peace, and the water was golden and rippling. Babbitt drew his hand through
  the cool flood, and mused:</p>

  <p>"We never thought we'd come to Maine together!"</p>

  <p>"No. We've never done anything the way we thought we would. I expected to
  live in Germany with my granddad's people, and study the fiddle."</p>

  <p>"That's so. And remember how I wanted to be a lawyer and go into politics?
  I still think I might have made a go of it. I've kind of got the gift of the
  gab&mdash;anyway, I can think on my feet, and make some kind of a spiel on
  most anything, and of course that's the thing you need in politics. By golly,
  Ted's going to law-school, even if I didn't! Well&mdash;I guess it's worked
  out all right. Myra's been a fine wife. And Zilla means well, Paulibus."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Up here, I figure out all sorts of plans to keep her amused. I kind
  of feel life is going to be different, now that we're getting a good rest and
  can go back and start over again."</p>

  <p>"I hope so, old boy." Shyly: "Say, gosh, it's been awful nice to sit
  around and loaf and gamble and act regular, with you along, you old
  horse-thief!"</p>

  <p>"Well, you know what it means to me, Georgie. Saved my life."</p>

  <p>The shame of emotion overpowered them; they cursed a little, to prove they
  were good rough fellows; and in a mellow silence, Babbitt whistling while
  Paul hummed, they paddled back to the hotel.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">Though it was Paul who had seemed overwrought, Babbitt who
  had been the protecting big brother, Paul became clear-eyed and merry, while
  Babbitt sank into irritability. He uncovered layer on layer of hidden
  weariness. At first he had played nimble jester to Paul and for him sought
  amusements; by the end of the week Paul was nurse, and Babbitt accepted
  favors with the condescension one always shows a patient nurse.</p>

  <p>The day before their families arrived, the women guests at the hotel
  bubbled, "Oh, isn't it nice! You must be so excited;" and the proprieties
  compelled Babbitt and Paul to look excited. But they went to bed early and
  grumpy.</p>

  <p>When Myra appeared she said at once, "Now, we want you boys to go on
  playing around just as if we weren't here."</p>

  <p>The first evening, he stayed out for poker with the guides, and she said
  in placid merriment, "My! You're a regular bad one!" The second evening, she
  groaned sleepily, "Good heavens, are you going to be out every single night?"
  The third evening, he didn't play poker.</p>

  <p>He was tired now in every cell. "Funny! Vacation doesn't seem to have done
  me a bit of good," he lamented. "Paul's frisky as a colt, but I swear, I'm
  crankier and nervouser than when I came up here."</p>

  <p>He had three weeks of Maine. At the end of the second week he began to
  feel calm, and interested in life. He planned an expedition to climb Sachem
  Mountain, and wanted to camp overnight at Box Car Pond. He was curiously
  weak, yet cheerful, as though he had cleansed his veins of poisonous energy
  and was filling them with wholesome blood.</p>

  <p>He ceased to be irritated by Ted's infatuation with a waitress (his
  seventh tragic affair this year); he played catch with Ted, and with pride
  taught him to cast a fly in the pine-shadowed silence of Skowtuit Pond.</p>

  <p>At the end he sighed, "Hang it, I'm just beginning to enjoy my vacation.
  But, well, I feel a lot better. And it's going to be one great year! Maybe
  the Real Estate Board will elect me president, instead of some fuzzy
  old-fashioned faker like Chan Mott."</p>

  <p>On the way home, whenever he went into the smoking-compartment he felt
  guilty at deserting his wife and angry at being expected to feel guilty, but
  each time he triumphed, "Oh, this is going to be a great year, a great old
  year!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">All the way home from Maine, Babbitt was certain that he was
  a changed man. He was converted to serenity. He was going to cease worrying
  about business. He was going to have more "interests"&mdash;theaters, public
  affairs, reading. And suddenly, as he finished an especially heavy cigar, he
  was going to stop smoking.</p>

  <p>He invented a new and perfect method. He would buy no tobacco; he would
  depend on borrowing it; and, of course, he would be ashamed to borrow often.
  In a spasm of righteousness he flung his cigar-case out of the
  smoking-compartment window. He went back and was kind to his wife about
  nothing in particular; he admired his own purity, and decided, "Absolutely
  simple. Just a matter of will-power." He started a magazine serial about a
  scientific detective. Ten miles on, he was conscious that he desired to
  smoke. He ducked his head, like a turtle going into its shell; he appeared
  uneasy; he skipped two pages in his story and didn't know it. Five miles
  later, he leaped up and sought the porter. "Say, uh, George, have you got
  a&mdash;" The porter looked patient. "Have you got a time-table?" Babbitt
  finished. At the next stop he went out and bought a cigar. Since it was to be
  his last before he reached Zenith, he finished it down to an inch stub.</p>

  <p>Four days later he again remembered that he had stopped smoking, but he
  was too busy catching up with his office-work to keep it remembered.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Baseball, he determined, would be an excellent hobby. "No
  sense a man's working his fool head off. I'm going out to the Game three
  times a week. Besides, fellow ought to support the home team."</p>

  <p>He did go and support the team, and enhance the glory of Zenith, by
  yelling "Attaboy!" and "Rotten!" He performed the rite scrupulously. He wore
  a cotton handkerchief about his collar; he became sweaty; he opened his mouth
  in a wide loose grin; and drank lemon soda out of a bottle. He went to the
  Game three times a week, for one week. Then he compromised on watching the
  <i>Advocate-Times</i> bulletin-board. He stood in the thickest and steamiest
  of the crowd, and as the boy up on the lofty platform recorded the
  achievements of Big Bill Bostwick, the pitcher, Babbitt remarked to complete
  strangers, "Pretty nice! Good work!" and hastened back to the office.</p>

  <p>He honestly believed that he loved baseball. It is true that he hadn't, in
  twenty-five years, himself played any baseball except back-lot catch with
  Ted&mdash;very gentle, and strictly limited to ten minutes. But the game was
  a custom of his clan, and it gave outlet for the homicidal and sides-taking
  instincts which Babbitt called "patriotism" and "love of sport."</p>

  <p>As he approached the office he walked faster and faster, muttering, "Guess
  better hustle." All about him the city was hustling, for hustling's sake. Men
  in motors were hustling to pass one another in the hustling traffic. Men were
  hustling to catch trolleys, with another trolley a minute behind, and to leap
  from the trolleys, to gallop across the sidewalk, to hurl themselves into
  buildings, into hustling express elevators. Men in dairy lunches were
  hustling to gulp down the food which cooks had hustled to fry. Men in barber
  shops were snapping, "Jus' shave me once over. Gotta hustle." Men were
  feverishly getting rid of visitors in offices adorned with the signs, "This
  Is My Busy Day" and "The Lord Created the World in Six Days&mdash;You Can
  Spiel All You Got to Say in Six Minutes." Men who had made five thousand,
  year before last, and ten thousand last year, were urging on nerve-yelping
  bodies and parched brains so that they might make twenty thousand this year;
  and the men who had broken down immediately after making their twenty
  thousand dollars were hustling to catch trains, to hustle through the
  vacations which the hustling doctors had ordered.</p>

  <p>Among them Babbitt hustled back to his office, to sit down with nothing
  much to do except see that the staff looked as though they were hustling.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Every Saturday afternoon he hustled out to his country club
  and hustled through nine holes of golf as a rest after the week's hustle.</p>

  <p>In Zenith it was as necessary for a Successful Man to belong to a country
  club as it was to wear a linen collar. Babbitt's was the Outing Golf and
  Country Club, a pleasant gray-shingled building with a broad porch, on a
  daisy-starred cliff above Lake Kennepoose. There was another, the Tonawanda
  Country Club, to which belonged Charles McKelvey, Horace Updike, and the
  other rich men who lunched not at the Athletic but at the Union Club. Babbitt
  explained with frequency, "You couldn't hire me to join the Tonawanda, even
  if I did have a hundred and eighty bucks to throw away on the initiation fee.
  At the Outing we've got a bunch of real human fellows, and the finest lot of
  little women in town&mdash;just as good at joshing as the men&mdash;but at
  the Tonawanda there's nothing but these would-be's in New York get-ups,
  drinking tea! Too much dog altogether. Why, I wouldn't join the Tonawanda
  even if they&mdash;I wouldn't join it on a bet!"</p>

  <p>When he had played four or five holes, he relaxed a bit, his
  tobacco-fluttering heart beat more normally, and his voice slowed to the
  drawling of his hundred generations of peasant ancestors.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">At least once a week Mr. and Mrs. Babbitt and Tinka went to
  the movies. Their favorite motion-picture theater was the Chateau, which held
  three thousand spectators and had an orchestra of fifty pieces which played
  Arrangements from the Operas and suites portraying a Day on the Farm, or a
  Four-alarm Fire. In the stone rotunda, decorated with crown-embroidered
  velvet chairs and almost medieval tapestries, parrakeets sat on gilded lotos
  columns.</p>

  <p>With exclamations of "Well, by golly!" and "You got to go some to beat
  this dump!" Babbitt admired the Chateau. As he stared across the thousands of
  heads, a gray plain in the dimness, as he smelled good clothes and mild
  perfume and chewing-gum, he felt as when he had first seen a mountain and
  realized how very, very much earth and rock there was in it.</p>

  <p>He liked three kinds of films: pretty bathing girls with bare legs;
  policemen or cowboys and an industrious shooting of revolvers; and funny fat
  men who ate spaghetti. He chuckled with immense, moist-eyed sentimentality at
  interludes portraying puppies, kittens, and chubby babies; and he wept at
  deathbeds and old mothers being patient in mortgaged cottages. Mrs. Babbitt
  preferred the pictures in which handsome young women in elaborate frocks
  moved through sets ticketed as the drawing-rooms of New York millionaires. As
  for Tinka, she preferred, or was believed to prefer, whatever her parents
  told her to.</p>

  <p>All his relaxations&mdash;baseball, golf, movies, bridge, motoring, long
  talks with Paul at the Athletic Club, or at the Good Red Beef and Old English
  Chop House&mdash;were necessary to Babbitt, for he was entering a year of
  such activity as he had never known.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">It was by accident that Babbitt had his opportunity to
  address the S. A. R. E. B.</p>

  <p>The S. A. R. E. B., as its members called it, with the universal passion
  for mysterious and important-sounding initials, was the State Association of
  Real Estate Boards; the organization of brokers and operators. It was to hold
  its annual convention at Monarch, Zenith's chief rival among the cities of
  the state. Babbitt was an official delegate; another was Cecil Rountree, whom
  Babbitt admired for his picaresque speculative building, and hated for his
  social position, for being present at the smartest dances on Royal Ridge.
  Rountree was chairman of the convention program-committee.</p>

  <p>Babbitt had growled to him, "Makes me tired the way these doctors and
  profs and preachers put on lugs about being 'professional men.' A good
  realtor has to have more knowledge and finesse than any of 'em."</p>

  <p>"Right you are! I say: Why don't you put that into a paper, and give it at
  the S. A. R. E. B.?" suggested Rountree.</p>

  <p>"Well, if it would help you in making up the program&mdash;Tell you: the
  way I look at it is this: First place, we ought to insist that folks call us
  'realtors' and not 'real-estate men.' Sounds more like a reg'lar profession.
  Second place&mdash;What is it distinguishes a profession from a mere trade,
  business, or occupation? What is it? Why, it's the public service and the
  skill, the trained skill, and the knowledge and, uh, all that, whereas a
  fellow that merely goes out for the jack, he never considers the-public
  service and trained skill and so on. Now as a professional&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rather! That's perfectly bully! Perfectly corking! Now you write it in a
  paper," said Rountree, as he rapidly and firmly moved away.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">However accustomed to the literary labors of advertisements
  and correspondence, Babbitt was dismayed on the evening when he sat down to
  prepare a paper which would take a whole ten minutes to read.</p>

  <p>He laid out a new fifteen-cent school exercise-book on his wife's
  collapsible sewing-table, set up for the event in the living-room. The
  household had been bullied into silence; Verona and Ted requested to
  disappear, and Tinka threatened with "If I hear one sound out of you&mdash;if
  you holler for a glass of water one single solitary time&mdash;You better
  not, that's all!" Mrs. Babbitt sat over by the piano, making a nightgown and
  gazing with respect while Babbitt wrote in the exercise-book, to the
  rhythmical wiggling and squeaking of the sewing-table.</p>

  <p>When he rose, damp and jumpy, and his throat dusty from cigarettes, she
  marveled, "I don't see how you can just sit down and make up things right out
  of your own head!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's the training in constructive imagination that a fellow gets in
  modern business life."</p>

  <p>He had written seven pages, whereof the first page set forth:</p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1000061h-images/Babbitt-1.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The other six pages were rather like the first.</p>

  <p>For a week he went about looking important. Every morning, as he dressed,
  he thought aloud: "Jever stop to consider, Myra, that before a town can have
  buildings or prosperity or any of those things, some realtor has got to sell
  'em the land? All civilization starts with him. Jever realize that?" At the
  Athletic Club he led unwilling men aside to inquire, "Say, if you had to read
  a paper before a big convention, would you start in with the funny stories or
  just kind of scatter 'em all through?" He asked Howard Littlefield for a "set
  of statistics about real-estate sales; something good and impressive," and
  Littlefield provided something exceedingly good and impressive.</p>

  <p>But it was to T. Cholmondeley Frink that Babbitt most often turned. He
  caught Frink at the club every noon, and demanded, while Frink looked hunted
  and evasive, "Say, Chum&mdash;you're a shark on this writing stuff&mdash;how
  would you put this sentence, see here in my manuscript&mdash;manuscript now
  where the deuce is that?&mdash;oh, yes, here. Would you say 'We ought not
  also to alone think?' or 'We ought also not to think alone?' or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>One evening when his wife was away and he had no one to impress, Babbitt
  forgot about Style, Order, and the other mysteries, and scrawled off what he
  really thought about the real-estate business and about himself, and he found
  the paper written. When he read it to his wife she yearned, "Why, dear, it's
  splendid; beautifully written, and so clear and interesting, and such
  splendid ideas! Why, it's just&mdash;it's just splendid!"</p>

  <p>Next day he cornered Chum Frink and crowed, "Well, old son, I finished it
  last evening! Just lammed it out! I used to think you writing-guys must have
  a hard job making up pieces, but Lord, it's a cinch. Pretty soft for you
  fellows; you certainly earn your money easy! Some day when I get ready to
  retire, guess I'll take to writing and show you boys how to do it. I always
  used to think I could write better stuff, and more punch and originality,
  than all this stuff you see printed, and now I'm doggone sure of it!"</p>

  <p>He had four copies of the paper typed in black with a gorgeous red title,
  had them bound in pale blue manilla, and affably presented one to old Ira
  Runyon, the managing editor of the <i>Advocate-Times</i>, who said yes,
  indeed yes, he was very glad to have it, and he certainly would read it all
  through&mdash;as soon as he could find time.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Babbitt could not go to Monarch. She had a women's-club meeting.
  Babbitt said that he was very sorry.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Besides the five official delegates to the
  convention&mdash;Babbitt, Rountree, W. A. Rogers, Alvin Thayer, and Elbert
  Wing&mdash;there were fifty unofficial delegates, most of them with their
  wives.</p>

  <p>They met at the Union Station for the midnight train to Monarch. All of
  them, save Cecil Rountree, who was such a snob that he never wore badges,
  displayed celluloid buttons the size of dollars and lettered "We zoom for
  Zenith." The official delegates were magnificent with silver and magenta
  ribbons. Martin Lumsen's little boy Willy carried a tasseled banner inscribed
  "Zenith the Zip City&mdash;Zeal, Zest and Zowie&mdash;1,000,000 in 1935." As
  the delegates arrived, not in taxicabs but in the family automobile driven by
  the oldest son or by Cousin Fred, they formed impromptu processions through
  the station waiting-room.</p>

  <p>It was a new and enormous waiting-room, with marble pilasters, and
  frescoes depicting the exploration of the Chaloosa River Valley by Pere Emile
  Fauthoux in 1740. The benches were shelves of ponderous mahogany; the
  news-stand a marble kiosk with a brass grill. Down the echoing spaces of the
  hall the delegates paraded after Willy Lumsen's banner, the men waving their
  cigars, the women conscious of their new frocks and strings of beads, all
  singing to the tune of Auld Lang Syne the official City Song, written by Chum
  Frink:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Good old Zenith,<br>
  Our kin and kith,<br>
  Wherever we may be,<br>
  Hats in the ring,<br>
  We blithely sing<br>
  Of thy Prosperity.</p>

  <p><br>
  Warren Whitby, the broker, who had a gift of verse for banquets and
  birthdays, had added to Frink's City Song a special verse for the realtors'
  convention:</p>

  <p class="verse">Oh, here we come,<br>
  The fellows from<br>
  Zenith, the Zip Citee.<br>
  We wish to state<br>
  In real estate<br>
  There's none so live as we.</p>

  <p><br>
  Babbitt was stirred to hysteric patriotism. He leaped on a bench, shouting to
  the crowd:</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with Zenith?"</p>

  <p>"She's all right!"</p>

  <p>"What's best ole town in the U. S. A.?"</p>

  <p>"Zeeeeeen-ith!"</p>

  <p>The patient poor people waiting for the midnight train stared in unenvious
  wonder&mdash;Italian women with shawls, old weary men with broken shoes,
  roving road-wise boys in suits which had been flashy when they were new but
  which were faded now and wrinkled.</p>

  <p>Babbitt perceived that as an official delegate he must be more dignified.
  With Wing and Rogers he tramped up and down the cement platform beside the
  waiting Pullmans. Motor-driven baggage-trucks and red-capped porters carrying
  bags sped down the platform with an agreeable effect of activity. Arc-lights
  glared and stammered overhead. The glossy yellow sleeping-cars shone
  impressively. Babbitt made his voice to be measured and lordly; he thrust out
  his abdomen and rumbled, "We got to see to it that the convention lets the
  Legislature understand just where they get off in this matter of taxing
  realty transfers." Wing uttered approving grunts and Babbitt
  swelled&mdash;gloated.</p>

  <p>The blind of a Pullman compartment was raised, and Babbitt looked into an
  unfamiliar world. The occupant of the compartment was Lucile McKelvey, the
  pretty wife of the millionaire contractor. Possibly, Babbitt thrilled, she
  was going to Europe! On the seat beside her was a bunch of orchids and
  violets, and a yellow paper-bound book which seemed foreign. While he stared,
  she picked up the book, then glanced out of the window as though she was
  bored. She must have looked straight at him, and he had met her, but she gave
  no sign. She languidly pulled down the blind, and he stood still, a cold
  feeling of insignificance in his heart.</p>

  <p>But on the train his pride was restored by meeting delegates from Sparta,
  Pioneer, and other smaller cities of the state, who listened respectfully
  when, as a magnifico from the metropolis of Zenith, he explained politics and
  the value of a Good Sound Business Administration. They fell joyfully into
  shop-talk, the purest and most rapturous form of conversation:</p>

  <p>"How'd this fellow Rountree make out with this big apartment-hotel he was
  going to put up? Whadde do? Get out bonds to finance it?" asked a Sparta
  broker.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you," said Babbitt. "Now if I'd been handling
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So," Elbert Wing was droning, "I hired this shop-window for a week, and
  put up a big sign, 'Toy Town for Tiny Tots,' and stuck in a lot of doll
  houses and some dinky little trees, and then down at the bottom, 'Baby Likes
  This Dollydale, but Papa and Mama Will Prefer Our Beautiful Bungalows,' and
  you know, that certainly got folks talking, and first week we
  sold&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The trucks sang "lickety-lick, lickety-lick" as the train ran through the
  factory district. Furnaces spurted flame, and power-hammers were clanging.
  Red lights, green lights, furious white lights rushed past, and Babbitt was
  important again, and eager.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">He did a voluptuous thing: he had his clothes pressed on the
  train. In the morning, half an hour before they reached Monarch, the porter
  came to his berth and whispered, "There's a drawing-room vacant, sir. I put
  your suit in there." In tan autumn overcoat over his pajamas, Babbitt slipped
  down the green-curtain-lined aisle to the glory of his first private
  compartment. The porter indicated that he knew Babbitt was used to a
  man-servant; he held the ends of Babbitt's trousers, that the beautifully
  sponged garment might not be soiled, filled the bowl in the private washroom,
  and waited with a towel.</p>

  <p>To have a private washroom was luxurious. However enlivening a Pullman
  smoking-compartment was by night, even to Babbitt it was depressing in the
  morning, when it was jammed with fat men in woolen undershirts, every hook
  filled with wrinkled cottony shirts, the leather seat piled with dingy
  toilet-kits, and the air nauseating with the smell of soap and toothpaste.
  Babbitt did not ordinarily think much of privacy, but now he reveled in it,
  reveled in his valet, and purred with pleasure as he gave the man a tip of a
  dollar and a half.</p>

  <p>He rather hoped that he was being noticed as, in his newly pressed
  clothes, with the adoring porter carrying his suit-case, he disembarked at
  Monarch.</p>

  <p>He was to share a room at the Hotel Sedgwick with W. A. Rogers, that
  shrewd, rustic-looking Zenith dealer in farm-lands. Together they had a noble
  breakfast, with waffles, and coffee not in exiguous cups but in large pots.
  Babbitt grew expansive, and told Rogers about the art of writing; he gave a
  bellboy a quarter to fetch a morning newspaper from the lobby, and sent to
  Tinka a post-card: "Papa wishes you were here to bat round with him."</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">The meetings of the convention were held in the ballroom of
  the Allen House. In an anteroom was the office of the chairman of the
  executive committee. He was the busiest man in the convention; he was so busy
  that he got nothing done whatever. He sat at a marquetry table, in a room
  littered with crumpled paper and, all day long, town-boosters and lobbyists
  and orators who wished to lead debates came and whispered to him, whereupon
  he looked vague, and said rapidly, "Yes, yes, that's a fine idea; we'll do
  that," and instantly forgot all about it, lighted a cigar and forgot that
  too, while the telephone rang mercilessly and about him men kept beseeching,
  "Say, Mr. Chairman&mdash;say, Mr. Chairman!" without penetrating his
  exhausted hearing.</p>

  <p>In the exhibit-room were plans of the new suburbs of Sparta, pictures of
  the new state capitol, at Galop de Vache, and large ears of corn with the
  label, "Nature's Gold, from Shelby County, the Garden Spot of God's Own
  Country."</p>

  <p>The real convention consisted of men muttering in hotel bedrooms or in
  groups amid the badge-spotted crowd in the hotel-lobby, but there was a show
  of public meetings.</p>

  <p>The first of them opened with a welcome by the mayor of Monarch. The
  pastor of the First Christian Church of Monarch, a large man with a long damp
  frontal lock, informed God that the real-estate men were here now.</p>

  <p>The venerable Minnemagantic realtor, Major Carlton Tuke, read a paper in
  which he denounced cooperative stores. William A. Larkin of Eureka gave a
  comforting prognosis of "The Prospects for Increased Construction," and
  reminded them that plate-glass prices were two points lower.</p>

  <p>The convention was on.</p>

  <p>The delegates were entertained, incessantly and firmly. The Monarch
  Chamber of Commerce gave them a banquet, and the Manufacturers' Association
  an afternoon reception, at which a chrysanthemum was presented to each of the
  ladies, and to each of the men a leather bill-fold inscribed "From Monarch
  the Mighty Motor Mart."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Crosby Knowlton, wife of the manufacturer of Fleetwing Automobiles,
  opened her celebrated Italian garden and served tea. Six hundred real-estate
  men and wives ambled down the autumnal paths. Perhaps three hundred of them
  were quietly inconspicuous; perhaps three hundred vigorously exclaimed, "This
  is pretty slick, eh?" surreptitiously picked the late asters and concealed
  them in their pockets, and tried to get near enough to Mrs. Knowlton to shake
  her lovely hand. Without request, the Zenith delegates (except Rountree)
  gathered round a marble dancing nymph and sang "Here we come, the fellows
  from Zenith, the Zip Citee."</p>

  <p>It chanced that all the delegates from Pioneer belonged to the Brotherly
  and Protective Order of Elks, and they produced an enormous banner lettered:
  "B. P. O. E.&mdash;Best People on Earth&mdash;Boost Pioneer, Oh Eddie." Nor
  was Galop de Vache, the state capital, to be slighted. The leader of the
  Galop de Vache delegation was a large, reddish, roundish man, but active. He
  took off his coat, hurled his broad black felt hat on the ground, rolled up
  his sleeves, climbed upon the sundial, spat, and bellowed:</p>

  <p>"We'll tell the world, and the good lady who's giving the show this
  afternoon, that the bonniest burg in this man's state is Galop de Vache. You
  boys can talk about your zip, but jus' lemme murmur that old Galop has the
  largest proportion of home-owning citizens in the state; and when folks own
  their homes, they ain't starting labor-troubles, and they're raising kids
  instead of raising hell! Galop de Vache! The town for homey folks! The town
  that eats 'em alive oh, Bosco! We'll&mdash;tell&mdash;the&mdash;world!"</p>

  <p>The guests drove off; the garden shivered into quiet. But Mrs. Crosby
  Knowlton sighed as she looked at a marble seat warm from five hundred summers
  of Amalfi. On the face of a winged sphinx which supported it some one had
  drawn a mustache in lead-pencil. Crumpled paper napkins were dumped among the
  Michaelmas daisies. On the walk, like shredded lovely flesh, were the petals
  of the last gallant rose. Cigarette stubs floated in the goldfish pool,
  trailing an evil stain as they swelled and disintegrated, and beneath the
  marble seat, the fragments carefully put together, was a smashed teacup.</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">As he rode back to the hotel Babbitt reflected, "Myra would
  have enjoyed all this social agony." For himself he cared less for the garden
  party than for the motor tours which the Monarch Chamber of Commerce had
  arranged. Indefatigably he viewed water-reservoirs, suburban
  trolley-stations, and tanneries. He devoured the statistics which were given
  to him, and marveled to his roommate, W. A. Rogers, "Of course this town
  isn't a patch on Zenith; it hasn't got our outlook and natural resources; but
  did you know&mdash;I nev' did till to-day&mdash;that they manufactured seven
  hundred and sixty-three million feet of lumber last year? What d' you think
  of that!"</p>

  <p>He was nervous as the time for reading his paper approached. When he stood
  on the low platform before the convention, he trembled and saw only a purple
  haze. But he was in earnest, and when he had finished the formal paper he
  talked to them, his hands in his pockets, his spectacled face a flashing
  disk, like a plate set up on edge in the lamplight. They shouted "That's the
  stuff!" and in the discussion afterward they referred with impressiveness to
  "our friend and brother, Mr. George F. Babbitt." He had in fifteen minutes
  changed from a minor delegate to a personage almost as well known as that
  diplomat of business, Cecil Rountree. After the meeting, delegates from all
  over the state said, "Hower you, Brother Babbitt?" Sixteen complete strangers
  called him "George," and three men took him into corners to confide, "Mighty
  glad you had the courage to stand up and give the Profession a real boost.
  Now I've always maintained&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Next morning, with tremendous casualness, Babbitt asked the girl at the
  hotel news-stand for the newspapers from Zenith. There was nothing in the
  Press, but in the <i>Advocate-Times</i>, on the third page&mdash;He gasped.
  They had printed his picture and a half-column account. The heading was
  "Sensation at Annual Land-men's Convention. G. F. Babbitt, Prominent Ziptown
  Realtor, Keynoter in Fine Address."</p>

  <p>He murmured reverently, "I guess some of the folks on Floral Heights will
  sit up and take notice now, and pay a little attention to old Georgie!"</p>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p class="first">It was the last meeting. The delegations were presenting the
  claims of their several cities to the next year's convention. Orators were
  announcing that "Galop de Vache, the Capital City, the site of Kremer College
  and of the Upholtz Knitting Works, is the recognized center of culture and
  high-class enterprise;" and that "Hamburg, the Big Little City with the
  Logical Location, where every man is open-handed and every woman a
  heaven-born hostess, throws wide to you her hospitable gates."</p>

  <p>In the midst of these more diffident invitations, the golden doors of the
  ballroom opened with a blatting of trumpets, and a circus parade rolled in.
  It was composed of the Zenith brokers, dressed as cowpunchers, bareback
  riders, Japanese jugglers. At the head was big Warren Whitby, in the bearskin
  and gold-and-crimson coat of a drum-major. Behind him, as a clown, beating a
  bass drum, extraordinarily happy and noisy, was Babbitt.</p>

  <p>Warren Whitby leaped on the platform, made merry play with his baton, and
  observed, "Boyses and girlses, the time has came to get down to cases. A
  dyed-in-the-wool Zenithite sure loves his neighbors, but we've made up our
  minds to grab this convention off our neighbor burgs like we've grabbed the
  condensed-milk business and the paper-box business and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>J. Harry Barmhill, the convention chairman, hinted, "We're grateful to
  you, Mr. Uh, but you must give the other boys a chance to hand in their bids
  now."</p>

  <p>A fog-horn voice blared, "In Eureka we'll promise free motor rides through
  the prettiest country&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Running down the aisle, clapping his hands, a lean bald young man cried,
  "I'm from Sparta! Our Chamber of Commerce has wired me they've set aside
  eight thousand dollars, in real money, for the entertainment of the
  convention!"</p>

  <p>A clerical-looking man rose to clamor, "Money talks! Move we accept the
  bid from Sparta!"</p>

  <p>It was accepted.</p>

  <h3>VIII</h3>

  <p class="first">The Committee on Resolutions was reporting. They said that
  Whereas Almighty God in his beneficent mercy had seen fit to remove to a
  sphere of higher usefulness some thirty-six realtors of the state the past
  year, Therefore it was the sentiment of this convention assembled that they
  were sorry God had done it, and the secretary should be, and hereby was,
  instructed to spread these resolutions on the minutes, and to console the
  bereaved families by sending them each a copy.</p>

  <p>A second resolution authorized the president of the S.A.R.E.B. to spend
  fifteen thousand dollars in lobbying for sane tax measures in the State
  Legislature. This resolution had a good deal to say about Menaces to Sound
  Business and clearing the Wheels of Progress from ill-advised and
  shortsighted obstacles.</p>

  <p>The Committee on Committees reported, and with startled awe Babbitt
  learned that he had been appointed a member of the Committee on Torrens
  Titles.</p>

  <p>He rejoiced, "I said it was going to be a great year! Georgie, old son,
  you got big things ahead of you! You're a natural-born orator and a good
  mixer and&mdash;Zowie!"</p>

  <h3>IX</h3>

  <p class="first">There was no formal entertainment provided for the last
  evening. Babbitt had planned to go home, but that afternoon the Jered
  Sassburgers of Pioneer suggested that Babbitt and W. A. Rogers have tea with
  them at the Catalpa Inn.</p>

  <p>Teas were not unknown to Babbitt&mdash;his wife and he earnestly attended
  them at least twice a year&mdash;but they were sufficiently exotic to make
  him feel important. He sat at a glass-covered table in the Art Room of the
  Inn, with its painted rabbits, mottoes lettered on birch bark, and waitresses
  being artistic in Dutch caps; he ate insufficient lettuce sandwiches, and was
  lively and naughty with Mrs. Sassburger, who was as smooth and large-eyed as
  a cloak-model. Sassburger and he had met two days before, so they were
  calling each other "Georgie" and "Sassy."</p>

  <p>Sassburger said prayerfully, "Say, boys, before you go, seeing this is the
  last chance, I've <i>got it</i>, up in my room, and Miriam here is the best
  little mixelogist in the Stati Unidos like us Italians say."</p>

  <p>With wide flowing gestures, Babbitt and Rogers followed the Sassburgers to
  their room. Mrs. Sassburger shrieked, "Oh, how terrible!" when she saw that
  she had left a chemise of sheer lavender crepe on the bed. She tucked it into
  a bag, while Babbitt giggled, "Don't mind us; we're a couple o' little
  divvils!"</p>

  <p>Sassburger telephoned for ice, and the bell-boy who brought it said,
  prosaically and unprompted, "Highball glasses or cocktail?" Miriam Sassburger
  mixed the cocktails in one of those dismal, nakedly white water-pitchers
  which exist only in hotels. When they had finished the first round she proved
  by intoning "Think you boys could stand another&mdash;you got a dividend
  coming" that, though she was but a woman, she knew the complete and perfect
  rite of cocktail-drinking.</p>

  <p>Outside, Babbitt hinted to Rogers, "Say, W. A., old rooster, it comes over
  me that I could stand it if we didn't go back to the lovin' wives, this
  handsome <i>Abend</i>, but just kind of stayed in Monarch and threw a party,
  heh?"</p>

  <p>"George, you speak with the tongue of wisdom and sagashiteriferousness. El
  Wing's wife has gone on to Pittsburg. Let's see if we can't gather him
  in."</p>

  <p>At half-past seven they sat in their room, with Elbert Wing and two
  up-state delegates. Their coats were off, their vests open, their faces red,
  their voices emphatic. They were finishing a bottle of corrosive bootlegged
  whisky and imploring the bell-boy, "Say, son, can you get us some more of
  this embalming fluid?" They were smoking large cigars and dropping ashes and
  stubs on the carpet. With windy guffaws they were telling stories. They were,
  in fact, males in a happy state of nature.</p>

  <p>Babbitt sighed, "I don't know how it strikes you hellions, but personally
  I like this busting loose for a change, and kicking over a couple of
  mountains and climbing up on the North Pole and waving the aurora borealis
  around."</p>

  <p>The man from Sparta, a grave, intense youngster, babbled, "Say! I guess
  I'm as good a husband as the run of the mill, but God, I do get so tired of
  going home every evening, and nothing to see but the movies. That's why I go
  out and drill with the National Guard. I guess I got the nicest little wife
  in my burg, but&mdash;Say! Know what I wanted to do as a kid? Know what I
  wanted to do? Wanted to be a big chemist. Tha's what I wanted to do. But Dad
  chased me out on the road selling kitchenware, and here I'm settled
  down&mdash;settled for <i>life</i>&mdash;not a chance! Oh, who the devil
  started this funeral talk? How 'bout 'nother lil drink? 'And a-noth-er drink
  wouldn' do 's 'ny harmmmmmmm.'"</p>

  <p>"Yea. Cut the sob-stuff," said W. A. Rogers genially. "You boys know I'm
  the village songster? Come on now&mdash;sing up:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Said the old Obadiah to the young Obadiah,<br>
  'I am dry, Obadiah, I am dry.'<br>
  Said the young Obadiah to the old Obadiah,<br>
  'So am I, Obadiah, so am I.'"</p><br>

  <h3>X</h3>

  <p class="first">They had dinner in the Moorish Grillroom of the Hotel
  Sedgwick. Somewhere, somehow, they seemed to have gathered in two other
  comrades: a manufacturer of fly-paper and a dentist. They all drank whisky
  from tea-cups, and they were humorous, and never listened to one another,
  except when W. A. Rogers "kidded" the Italian waiter.</p>

  <p>"Say, Gooseppy," he said innocently, "I want a couple o' fried elephants'
  ears."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, sir, we haven't any."</p>

  <p>"Huh? No elephants' ears? What do you know about that!" Rogers turned to
  Babbitt. "Pedro says the elephants' ears are all out!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be switched!" said the man from Sparta, with difficulty hiding
  his laughter.</p>

  <p>"Well, in that case, Carlo, just bring me a hunk o' steak and a couple o'
  bushels o' French fried potatoes and some peas," Rogers went on. "I suppose
  back in dear old sunny It' the Eyetalians get their fresh garden peas out of
  the can."</p>

  <p>"No, sir, we have very nice peas in Italy."</p>

  <p>"Is that a fact! Georgie, do you hear that? They get their fresh garden
  peas out of the garden, in Italy! By golly, you live and learn, don't you,
  Antonio, you certainly do live and learn, if you live long enough and keep
  your strength. All right, Garibaldi, just shoot me in that steak, with about
  two printers'-reams of French fried spuds on the promenade deck,
  <i>comprehenez-vous</i>, Michelovitch Angeloni?"</p>

  <p>Afterward Elbert Wing admired, "Gee, you certainly did have that poor Dago
  going, W. A. He couldn't make you out at all!"</p>

  <p>In the <i>Monarch Herald</i>, Babbitt found an advertisement which he read
  aloud, to applause and laughter:</p><br>

  <p>"Sounds like a juicy show to me. Let's all take it in," said Babbitt.</p>

  <p>But they put off departure as long as they could. They were safe while
  they sat here, legs firmly crossed under the table, but they felt unsteady;
  they were afraid of navigating the long and slippery floor of the grillroom
  under the eyes of the other guests and the too-attentive waiters.</p>

  <p>When they did venture, tables got in their way, and they sought to cover
  embarrassment by heavy jocularity at the coatroom. As the girl handed out
  their hats, they smiled at her, and hoped that she, a cool and expert judge,
  would feel that they were gentlemen. They croaked at one another, "Who owns
  the bum lid?" and "You take a good one, George; I'll take what's left," and
  to the check-girl they stammered, "Better come along, sister! High, wide, and
  fancy evening ahead!" All of them tried to tip her, urging one another, "No!
  Wait! Here! I got it right here!" Among them, they gave her three
  dollars.</p>

  <h3>XI</h3>

  <p class="first">Flamboyantly smoking cigars they sat in a box at the
  burlesque show, their feet up on the rail, while a chorus of twenty daubed,
  worried, and inextinguishably respectable grandams swung their legs in the
  more elementary chorus-evolutions, and a Jewish comedian made vicious fun of
  Jews. In the entr'actes they met other lone delegates. A dozen of them went
  in taxicabs out to Bright Blossom Inn, where the blossoms were made of dusty
  paper festooned along a room low and stinking, like a cow-stable no longer
  wisely used.</p>

  <p>Here, whisky was served openly, in glasses. Two or three clerks, who on
  pay-day longed to be taken for millionaires, sheepishly danced with
  telephone-girls and manicure-girls in the narrow space between the tables.
  Fantastically whirled the professionals, a young man in sleek evening-clothes
  and a slim mad girl in emerald silk, with amber hair flung up as jaggedly as
  flames. Babbitt tried to dance with her. He shuffled along the floor, too
  bulky to be guided, his steps unrelated to the rhythm of the jungle music,
  and in his staggering he would have fallen, had she not held him with supple
  kindly strength. He was blind and deaf from prohibition-era alcohol; he could
  not see the tables, the faces. But he was overwhelmed by the girl and her
  young pliant warmth.</p>

  <p>When she had firmly returned him to his group, he remembered, by a
  connection quite untraceable, that his mother's mother had been Scotch, and
  with head thrown back, eyes closed, wide mouth indicating ecstasy, he sang,
  very slowly and richly, "Loch Lomond."</p>

  <p>But that was the last of his mellowness and jolly companionship. The man
  from Sparta said he was a "bum singer," and for ten minutes Babbitt quarreled
  with him, in a loud, unsteady, heroic indignation. They called for drinks
  till the manager insisted that the place was closed. All the while Babbitt
  felt a hot raw desire for more brutal amusements. When W. A. Rogers drawled,
  "What say we go down the line and look over the girls?" he agreed savagely.
  Before they went, three of them secretly made appointments with the
  professional dancing girl, who agreed "Yes, yes, sure, darling" to everything
  they said, and amiably forgot them.</p>

  <p>As they drove back through the outskirts of Monarch, down streets of small
  brown wooden cottages of workmen, characterless as cells, as they rattled
  across warehouse-districts which by drunken night seemed vast and perilous,
  as they were borne toward the red lights and violent automatic pianos and the
  stocky women who simpered, Babbitt was frightened. He wanted to leap from the
  taxicab, but all his body was a murky fire, and he groaned, "Too late to quit
  now," and knew that he did not want to quit.</p>

  <p>There was, they felt, one very humorous incident on the way. A broker from
  Minnemagantic said, "Monarch is a lot sportier than Zenith. You Zenith
  tightwads haven't got any joints like these here." Babbitt raged, "That's a
  dirty lie! Snothin' you can't find in Zenith. Believe me, we got more houses
  and hootch-parlors an' all kinds o' dives than any burg in the state."</p>

  <p>He realized they were laughing at him; he desired to fight; and forgot it
  in such musty unsatisfying experiments as he had not known since college.</p>

  <p>In the morning, when he returned to Zenith, his desire for rebellion was
  partly satisfied. He had retrograded to a shamefaced contentment. He was
  irritable. He did not smile when W. A. Rogers complained, "Ow, what a head! I
  certainly do feel like the wrath of God this morning. Say! I know what was
  the trouble! Somebody went and put alcohol in my booze last night."</p>

  <p>Babbitt's excursion was never known to his family, nor to any one in
  Zenith save Rogers and Wing. It was not officially recognized even by
  himself. If it had any consequences, they have not been discovered.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">This autumn a Mr. W. G. Harding, of Marion, Ohio, was
  appointed President of the United States, but Zenith was less interested in
  the national campaign than in the local election. Seneca Doane, though he was
  a lawyer and a graduate of the State University, was candidate for mayor of
  Zenith on an alarming labor ticket. To oppose him the Democrats and
  Republicans united on Lucas Prout, a mattress-manufacturer with a perfect
  record for sanity. Mr. Prout was supported by the banks, the Chamber of
  Commerce, all the decent newspapers, and George F. Babbitt.</p>

  <p>Babbitt was precinct-leader on Floral Heights, but his district was safe
  and he longed for stouter battling. His convention paper had given him the
  beginning of a reputation for oratory, so the Republican-Democratic Central
  Committee sent him to the Seventh Ward and South Zenith, to address small
  audiences of workmen and clerks, and wives uneasy with their new votes. He
  acquired a fame enduring for weeks. Now and then a reporter was present at
  one of his meetings, and the headlines (though they were not very large)
  indicated that George F. Babbitt had addressed Cheering Throng, and
  Distinguished Man of Affairs had pointed out the Fallacies of Doane. Once, in
  the rotogravure section of the Sunday <i>Advocate-Times</i>, there was a
  photograph of Babbitt and a dozen other business men, with the caption
  "Leaders of Zenith Finance and Commerce Who Back Prout."</p>

  <p>He deserved his glory. He was an excellent campaigner. He had faith; he
  was certain that if Lincoln were alive, he would be electioneering for Mr. W.
  G. Harding&mdash;unless he came to Zenith and electioneered for Lucas Prout.
  He did not confuse audiences by silly subtleties; Prout represented honest
  industry, Seneca Doane represented whining laziness, and you could take your
  choice. With his broad shoulders and vigorous voice, he was obviously a Good
  Fellow; and, rarest of all, he really liked people. He almost liked common
  workmen. He wanted them to be well paid, and able to afford high
  rents&mdash;though, naturally, they must not interfere with the reasonable
  profits of stockholders. Thus nobly endowed, and keyed high by the discovery
  that he was a natural orator, he was popular with audiences, and he raged
  through the campaign, renowned not only in the Seventh and Eighth Wards but
  even in parts of the Sixteenth.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Crowded in his car, they came driving up to Turnverein Hall,
  South Zenith&mdash;Babbitt, his wife, Verona, Ted, and Paul and Zilla
  Riesling. The hall was over a delicatessen shop, in a street banging with
  trolleys and smelling of onions and gasoline and fried fish. A new
  appreciation of Babbitt filled all of them, including Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"Don't know how you keep it up, talking to three bunches in one evening.
  Wish I had your strength," said Paul; and Ted exclaimed to Verona, "The old
  man certainly does know how to kid these roughnecks along!"</p>

  <p>Men in black sateen shirts, their faces new-washed but with a hint of
  grime under their eyes, were loitering on the broad stairs up to the hall.
  Babbitt's party politely edged through them and into the whitewashed room, at
  the front of which was a dais with a red-plush throne and a pine altar
  painted watery blue, as used nightly by the Grand Masters and Supreme
  Potentates of innumerable lodges. The hall was full. As Babbitt pushed
  through the fringe standing at the back, he heard the precious tribute,
  "That's him!" The chairman bustled down the center aisle with an impressive,
  "The speaker? All ready, sir! Uh&mdash;let's see&mdash;what was the name,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>Then Babbitt slid into a sea of eloquence:</p>

  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen of the Sixteenth Ward, there is one who cannot be
  with us here to-night, a man than whom there is no more stalwart Trojan in
  all the political arena&mdash;I refer to our leader, the Honorable Lucas
  Prout, standard-bearer of the city and county of Zenith. Since he is not
  here, I trust that you will bear with me if, as a friend and neighbor, as one
  who is proud to share with you the common blessing of being a resident of the
  great city of Zenith, I tell you in all candor, honesty, and sincerity how
  the issues of this critical campaign appear to one plain man of
  business&mdash;to one who, brought up to the blessings of poverty and of
  manual labor, has, even when Fate condemned him to sit at a desk, yet never
  forgotten how it feels, by heck, to be up at five-thirty and at the factory
  with the ole dinner-pail in his hardened mitt when the whistle blew at seven,
  unless the owner sneaked in ten minutes on us and blew it early! (Laughter.)
  To come down to the basic and fundamental issues of this campaign, the great
  error, insincerely promulgated by Seneca Doane&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There were workmen who jeered&mdash;young cynical workmen, for the most
  part foreigners, Jews, Swedes, Irishmen, Italians&mdash;but the older men,
  the patient, bleached, stooped carpenters and mechanics, cheered him; and
  when he worked up to his anecdote of Lincoln their eyes were wet.</p>

  <p>Modestly, busily, he hurried out of the hall on delicious applause, and
  sped off to his third audience of the evening. "Ted, you better drive," he
  said. "Kind of all in after that spiel. Well, Paul, how'd it go? Did I get
  'em?"</p>

  <p>"Bully! Corking! You had a lot of pep."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Babbitt worshiped, "Oh, it was fine! So clear and interesting, and
  such nice ideas. When I hear you orating I realize I don't appreciate how
  profoundly you think and what a splendid brain and vocabulary you have.
  Just&mdash;splendid." But Verona was irritating. "Dad," she worried, "how do
  you know that public ownership of utilities and so on and so forth will
  always be a failure?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Babbitt reproved, "Rone, I should think you could see and realize
  that when your father's all worn out with orating, it's no time to expect him
  to explain these complicated subjects. I'm sure when he's rested he'll be
  glad to explain it to you. Now let's all be quiet and give Papa a chance to
  get ready for his next speech. Just think! Right now they're gathering in
  Maccabee Temple, and <i>waiting</i> for us!"</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Lucas Prout and Sound Business defeated Mr. Seneca Doane
  and Class Rule, and Zenith was again saved. Babbitt was offered several minor
  appointments to distribute among poor relations, but he preferred advance
  information about the extension of paved highways, and this a grateful
  administration gave to him. Also, he was one of only nineteen speakers at the
  dinner with which the Chamber of Commerce celebrated the victory of
  righteousness.</p>

  <p>His reputation for oratory established, at the dinner of the Zenith Real
  Estate Board he made the Annual Address. The <i>Advocate-Times</i> reported
  this speech with unusual fullness:</p>

  <p>"One of the livest banquets that has recently been pulled off occurred
  last night in the annual Get-Together Fest of the Zenith Real Estate Board,
  held in the Venetian Ball Room of the O'Hearn House. Mine host Gil O'Hearn
  had as usual done himself proud and those assembled feasted on such an
  assemblage of plates as could be rivaled nowhere west of New York, if there,
  and washed down the plenteous feed with the cup which inspired but did not
  inebriate in the shape of cider from the farm of Chandler Mott, president of
  the board and who acted as witty and efficient chairman.</p>

  <p>"As Mr. Mott was suffering from slight infection and sore throat, G. F.
  Babbitt made the principal talk. Besides outlining the progress of Torrensing
  real estate titles, Mr. Babbitt spoke in part as follows:</p>

  <p>"'In rising to address you, with my impromptu speech carefully tucked into
  my vest pocket, I am reminded of the story of the two Irishmen, Mike and Pat,
  who were riding on the Pullman. Both of them, I forgot to say, were sailors
  in the Navy. It seems Mike had the lower berth and by and by he heard a
  terrible racket from the upper, and when he yelled up to find out what the
  trouble was, Pat answered, "Shure an' bedad an' how can I ever get a night's
  sleep at all, at all? I been trying to get into this darned little hammock
  ever since eight bells!"</p>

  <p>"'Now, gentlemen, standing up here before you, I feel a good deal like
  Pat, and maybe after I've spieled along for a while, I may feel so darn small
  that I'll be able to crawl into a Pullman hammock with no trouble at all, at
  all!</p>

  <p>"'Gentlemen, it strikes me that each year at this annual occasion when
  friend and foe get together and lay down the battle-ax and let the waves of
  good-fellowship waft them up the flowery slopes of amity, it behooves us,
  standing together eye to eye and shoulder to shoulder as fellow-citizens of
  the best city in the world, to consider where we are both as regards
  ourselves and the common weal.</p>

  <p>"'It is true that even with our 361,000, or practically 362,000,
  population, there are, by the last census, almost a score of larger cities in
  the United States. But, gentlemen, if by the next census we do not stand at
  least tenth, then I'll be the first to request any knocker to remove my shirt
  and to eat the same, with the compliments of G. F. Babbitt, Esquire! It may
  be true that New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia will continue to keep ahead
  of us in size. But aside from these three cities, which are notoriously so
  overgrown that no decent white man, nobody who loves his wife and kiddies and
  God's good out-o'doors and likes to shake the hand of his neighbor in
  greeting, would want to live in them&mdash;and let me tell you right here and
  now, I wouldn't trade a high-class Zenith acreage development for the whole
  length and breadth of Broadway or State Street!&mdash;aside from these three,
  it's evident to any one with a head for facts that Zenith is the finest
  example of American life and prosperity to be found anywhere.</p>

  <p>"'I don't mean to say we're perfect. We've got a lot to do in the way of
  extending the paving of motor boulevards, for, believe me, it's the fellow
  with four to ten thousand a year, say, and an automobile and a nice little
  family in a bungalow on the edge of town, that makes the wheels of progress
  go round!</p>

  <p>"'That's the type of fellow that's ruling America to-day; in fact, it's
  the ideal type to which the entire world must tend, if there's to be a
  decent, well-balanced, Christian, go-ahead future for this little old planet!
  Once in a while I just naturally sit back and size up this Solid American
  Citizen, with a whale of a lot of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"'Our Ideal Citizen&mdash;I picture him first and foremost as being busier
  than a bird-dog, not wasting a lot of good time in day-dreaming or going to
  sassiety teas or kicking about things that are none of his business, but
  putting the zip into some store or profession or art. At night he lights up a
  good cigar, and climbs into the little old 'bus, and maybe cusses the
  carburetor, and shoots out home. He mows the lawn, or sneaks in some practice
  putting, and then he's ready for dinner. After dinner he tells the kiddies a
  story, or takes the family to the movies, or plays a few fists of bridge, or
  reads the evening paper, and a chapter or two of some good lively Western
  novel if he has a taste for literature, and maybe the folks next-door drop in
  and they sit and visit about their friends and the topics of the day. Then he
  goes happily to bed, his conscience clear, having contributed his mite to the
  prosperity of the city and to his own bank-account.</p>

  <p>"'In politics and religion this Sane Citizen is the canniest man on earth;
  and in the arts he invariably has a natural taste which makes him pick out
  the best, every time. In no country in the world will you find so many
  reproductions of the Old Masters and of well-known paintings on parlor walls
  as in these United States. No country has anything like our number of
  phonographs, with not only dance records and comic but also the best operas,
  such as Verdi, rendered by the world's highest-paid singers.</p>

  <p>"'In other countries, art and literature are left to a lot of shabby bums
  living in attics and feeding on booze and spaghetti, but in America the
  successful writer or picture-painter is indistinguishable from any other
  decent business man; and I, for one, am only too glad that the man who has
  the rare skill to season his message with interesting reading matter and who
  shows both purpose and pep in handling his literary wares has a chance to
  drag down his fifty thousand bucks a year, to mingle with the biggest
  executives on terms of perfect equality, and to show as big a house and as
  swell a car as any Captain of Industry! But, mind you, it's the appreciation
  of the Regular Guy who I have been depicting which has made this possible,
  and you got to hand as much credit to him as to the authors themselves.</p>

  <p>"'Finally, but most important, our Standardized Citizen, even if he is a
  bachelor, is a lover of the Little Ones, a supporter of the hearthstone which
  is the basic foundation of our civilization, first, last, and all the time,
  and the thing that most distinguishes us from the decayed nations of
  Europe.</p>

  <p>"'I have never yet toured Europe&mdash;and as a matter of fact, I don't
  know that I care to such an awful lot, as long as there's our own mighty
  cities and mountains to be seen&mdash;but, the way I figure it out, there
  must be a good many of our own sort of folks abroad. Indeed, one of the most
  enthusiastic Rotarians I ever met boosted the tenets of one-hundred-per-cent
  pep in a burr that smacked o' bonny Scutlond and all ye bonny braes o' Bobby
  Burns. But same time, one thing that distinguishes us from our good brothers,
  the hustlers over there, is that they're willing to take a lot off the snobs
  and journalists and politicians, while the modern American business man knows
  how to talk right up for himself, knows how to make it good and plenty clear
  that he intends to run the works. He doesn't have to call in some highbrow
  hired-man when it's necessary for him to answer the crooked critics of the
  sane and efficient life. He's not dumb, like the old-fashioned merchant. He's
  got a vocabulary and a punch.</p>

  <p>"'With all modesty, I want to stand up here as a representative business
  man and gently whisper, "Here's our kind of folks! Here's the specifications
  of the Standardized American Citizen! Here's the new generation of Americans:
  fellows with hair on their chests and smiles in their eyes and
  adding-machines in their offices. We're not doing any boasting, but we like
  ourselves first-rate, and if you don't like us, look out&mdash;better get
  under cover before the cyclone hits town!"</p>

  <p>"'So! In my clumsy way I have tried to sketch the Real He-man, the fellow
  with Zip and Bang. And it's because Zenith has so large a proportion of such
  men that it's the most stable, the greatest of our cities. New York also has
  its thousands of Real Folks, but New York is cursed with unnumbered
  foreigners. So are Chicago and San Francisco. Oh, we have a golden roster of
  cities&mdash;Detroit and Cleveland with their renowned factories, Cincinnati
  with its great machine-tool and soap products, Pittsburg and Birmingham with
  their steel, Kansas City and Minneapolis and Omaha that open their bountiful
  gates on the bosom of the ocean-like wheatlands, and countless other
  magnificent sister-cities, for, by the last census, there were no less than
  sixty-eight glorious American burgs with a population of over one hundred
  thousand! And all these cities stand together for power and purity, and
  against foreign ideas and communism&mdash;Atlanta with Hartford, Rochester
  with Denver, Milwaukee with Indianapolis, Los Angeles with Scranton,
  Portland, Maine, with Portland, Oregon. A good live wire from Baltimore or
  Seattle or Duluth is the twin-brother of every like fellow booster from
  Buffalo or Akron, Fort Worth or Oskaloosa!</p>

  <p>"'But it's here in Zenith, the home for manly men and womanly women and
  bright kids, that you find the largest proportion of these Regular Guys, and
  that's what sets it in a class by itself; that's why Zenith will be
  remembered in history as having set the pace for a civilization that shall
  endure when the old time-killing ways are gone forever and the day of earnest
  efficient endeavor shall have dawned all round the world!</p>

  <p>"'Some time I hope folks will quit handing all the credit to a lot of
  moth-eaten, mildewed, out-of-date, old, European dumps, and give proper
  credit to the famous Zenith spirit, that clean fighting determination to win
  Success that has made the little old Zip City celebrated in every land and
  clime, wherever condensed milk and pasteboard cartons are known! Believe me,
  the world has fallen too long for these worn-out countries that aren't
  producing anything but bootblacks and scenery and booze, that haven't got one
  bathroom per hundred people, and that don't know a loose-leaf ledger from a
  slip-cover; and it's just about time for some Zenithite to get his back up
  and holler for a show-down!</p>

  <p>"'I tell you, Zenith and her sister-cities are producing a new type of
  civilization. There are many resemblances between Zenith and these other
  burgs, and I'm darn glad of it! The extraordinary, growing, and sane
  standardization of stores, offices, streets, hotels, clothes, and newspapers
  throughout the United States shows how strong and enduring a type is
  ours.</p>

  <p>"'I always like to remember a piece that Chum Frink wrote for the
  newspapers about his lecture-tours. It is doubtless familiar to many of you,
  but if you will permit me, I'll take a chance and read it. It's one of the
  classic poems, like "If" by Kipling, or Ella Wheeler Wilcox's "The Man Worth
  While"; and I always carry this clipping of it in my note-book:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">When I am out upon the road,<br>
  a poet with a pedler's load<br>
  I mostly sing a hearty song,<br>
  and take a chew and hike along,<br>
  a-handing out my samples fine<br>
  of Cheero Brand of sweet sunshine,<br>
  and peddling optimistic pokes<br>
  and stable lines of japes and jokes<br>
  to Lyceums and other folks,<br>
  to Rotarys, Kiwanis' Clubs,<br>
  and feel I ain't like other dubs.</p>

  <p class="verse">And then old Major Silas Satan,<br>
  a brainy cuss who's always waitin',<br>
  he gives his tail a lively quirk,<br>
  and gets in quick his dirty work.</p>

  <p class="verse">He fills me up with mullygrubs;<br>
  my hair the backward way he rubs;<br>
  he makes me lonelier than a hound,<br>
  on Sunday when the folks ain't round.</p>

  <p class="verse">And then b' gosh, I would prefer<br>
  to never be a lecturer,<br>
  a-ridin' round in classy cars<br>
  and smoking fifty-cent cigars,<br>
  and never more I want to roam;<br>
  I simply want to be back home,<br>
  a-eatin' flap jacks, hash, and ham,<br>
  with folks who savvy whom I am!</p>

  <p class="verse">But when I get that lonely spell,<br>
  I simply seek the best hotel,<br>
  no matter in what town I be&mdash;<br>
  St. Paul, Toledo, or K.C.,<br>
  in Washington, Schenectady,<br>
  in Louisville or Albany.<br>
  And at that inn it hits my dome<br>
  that I again am right at home.</p>

  <p class="verse">If I should stand a lengthy spell<br>
  in front of that first-class hotel,<br>
  that to the drummers loves to cater,<br>
  across from some big film theayter;<br>
  if I should look around and buzz,<br>
  and wonder in what town I was,<br>
  I swear that I could never tell.</p>

  <p class="verse">For all the crowd would be so swell,<br>
  in just the same fine sort of jeans<br>
  they wear at home, and all the queens<br>
  with spiffy bonnets on their beans,<br>
  and all the fellows standing round<br>
  a-talkin' always, I'll be bound,<br>
  the same good jolly kind of guff,<br>
  'bout autos, politics and stuff<br>
  and baseball players of renown<br>
  that Nice Guys talk in my home town!</p>

  <p class="verse">Then when I entered that hotel,<br>
  I'd look around and say, "Well, well!"<br>
  For there would be the same news-stand,<br>
  same magazines and candies grand,<br>
  same smokes of famous standard brand,<br>
  I'd find at home, I'll tell!</p>

  <p class="verse">And when I saw the jolly bunch<br>
  come waltzing in for eats at lunch,<br>
  and squaring up in natty duds<br>
  to platters large of French Fried spuds,<br>
  why then I'd stand right up and bawl,<br>
  "I've never left my home at all!"</p>

  <p class="verse">And all replete I'd sit me down<br>
  beside some guy in derby brown<br>
  upon a lobby chair of plush,<br>
  and murmur to him in a rush,<br>
  "Hello, Bill, tell me, good old scout,<br>
  how is your stock a-holdin' out?"</p>

  <p class="verse">Then we'd be off, two solid pals,<br>
  a-chatterin' like giddy gals<br>
  of flivvers, weather, home, and wives,<br>
  lodge-brothers then for all our lives!</p>

  <p class="verse">So when Sam Satan makes you blue,<br>
  good friend, that's what I'd up and do,<br>
  for in these States where'er you roam,<br>
  you never leave your home sweet home.</p><br>

  <p>"'Yes, sir, these other burgs are our true partners in the great game of
  vital living. But let's not have any mistake about this. I claim that Zenith
  is the best partner and the fastest-growing partner of the whole caboodle. I
  trust I may be pardoned if I give a few statistics to back up my claims. If
  they are old stuff to any of you, yet the tidings of prosperity, like the
  good news of the Bible, never become tedious to the ears of a real hustler,
  no matter how oft the sweet story is told! Every intelligent person knows
  that Zenith manufactures more condensed milk and evaporated cream, more paper
  boxes, and more lighting-fixtures, than any other city in the United States,
  if not in the world. But it is not so universally known that we also stand
  second in the manufacture of package-butter, sixth in the giant realm of
  motors and automobiles, and somewhere about third in cheese, leather
  findings, tar roofing, breakfast food, and overalls!</p>

  <p>"'Our greatness, however, lies not alone in punchful prosperity but
  equally in that public spirit, that forward-looking idealism and brotherhood,
  which has marked Zenith ever since its foundation by the Fathers. We have a
  right, indeed we have a duty toward our fair city, to announce broadcast the
  facts about our high schools, characterized by their complete plants and the
  finest school-ventilating systems in the country, bar none; our magnificent
  new hotels and banks and the paintings and carved marble in their lobbies;
  and the Second National Tower, the second highest business building in any
  inland city in the entire country. When I add that we have an unparalleled
  number of miles of paved streets, bathrooms vacuum cleaners, and all the
  other signs of civilization; that our library and art museum are well
  supported and housed in convenient and roomy buildings; that our park-system
  is more than up to par, with its handsome driveways adorned with grass,
  shrubs, and statuary, then I give but a hint of the all round unlimited
  greatness of Zenith!</p>

  <p>"'I believe, however, in keeping the best to the last. When I remind you
  that we have one motor car for every five and seven-eighths persons in the
  city, then I give a rock-ribbed practical indication of the kind of progress
  and braininess which is synonymous with the name Zenith!</p>

  <p>"'But the way of the righteous is not all roses. Before I close I must
  call your attention to a problem we have to face, this coming year. The worst
  menace to sound government is not the avowed socialists but a lot of cowards
  who work under cover&mdash;the long-haired gentry who call themselves
  "liberals" and "radicals" and "non-partisan" and "intelligentsia" and God
  only knows how many other trick names! Irresponsible teachers and professors
  constitute the worst of this whole gang, and I am ashamed to say that several
  of them are on the faculty of our great State University! The U. is my own
  Alma Mater, and I am proud to be known as an alumni, but there are certain
  instructors there who seem to think we ought to turn the conduct of the
  nation over to hoboes and roustabouts.</p>

  <p>"'Those profs are the snakes to be scotched&mdash;they and all their
  milk-and-water ilk! The American business man is generous to a fault. But one
  thing he does demand of all teachers and lecturers and journalists: if we're
  going to pay them our good money, they've got to help us by selling
  efficiency and whooping it up for rational prosperity! And when it comes to
  these blab-mouth, fault-finding, pessimistic, cynical University teachers,
  let me tell you that during this golden coming year it's just as much our
  duty to bring influence to have those cusses fired as it is to sell all the
  real estate and gather in all the good shekels we can.</p>

  <p>"'Not till that is done will our sons and daughters see that the ideal of
  American manhood and culture isn't a lot of cranks sitting around chewing the
  rag about their Rights and their Wrongs, but a God-fearing, hustling,
  successful, two-fisted Regular Guy, who belongs to some church with pep and
  piety to it, who belongs to the Boosters or the Rotarians or the Kiwanis, to
  the Elks or Moose or Red Men or Knights of Columbus or any one of a score of
  organizations of good, jolly, kidding, laughing, sweating, upstanding,
  lend-a-handing Royal Good Fellows, who plays hard and works hard, and whose
  answer to his critics is a square-toed boot that'll teach the grouches and
  smart alecks to respect the He-man and get out and root for Uncle Samuel,
  U.S.A.!'"</p>

  <p class="first">Babbitt promised to become a recognized orator. He
  entertained a Smoker of the Men's Club of the Chatham Road presbyterian
  Church with Irish, Jewish, and Chinese dialect stories.</p>

  <p>But in nothing was he more clearly revealed as the Prominent Citizen than
  in his lecture on "Brass Tacks Facts on Real Estate," as delivered before the
  class in Sales Methods at the Zenith Y.M.C.A.</p>

  <p>The <i>Advocate-Times</i> reported the lecture so fully that Vergil Gunch
  said to Babbitt, "You're getting to be one of the classiest spellbinders in
  town. Seems 's if I couldn't pick up a paper without reading about your
  well-known eloquence. All this guff ought to bring a lot of business into
  your office. Good work! Keep it up!"</p>

  <p>"Go on, quit your kidding," said Babbitt feebly, but at this tribute from
  Gunch, himself a man of no mean oratorical fame, he expanded with delight and
  wondered how, before his vacation, he could have questioned the joys of being
  a solid citizen.</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">His march to greatness was not without disastrous
  stumbling.</p>

  <p>Fame did not bring the social advancement which the Babbitts deserved.
  They were not asked to join the Tonawanda Country Club nor invited to the
  dances at the Union. Himself, Babbitt fretted, he didn't "care a fat hoot for
  all these highrollers, but the wife would kind of like to be Among Those
  Present." He nervously awaited his university class-dinner and an evening of
  furious intimacy with such social leaders as Charles McKelvey the millionaire
  contractor, Max Kruger the banker, Irving Tate the tool-manufacturer, and
  Adelbert Dobson the fashionable interior decorator. Theoretically he was
  their friend, as he had been in college, and when he encountered them they
  still called him "Georgie," but he didn't seem to encounter them often, and
  they never invited him to dinner (with champagne and a butler) at their
  houses on Royal Ridge.</p>

  <p>All the week before the class-dinner he thought of them. "No reason why we
  shouldn't become real chummy now!"</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Like all true American diversions and spiritual outpourings,
  the dinner of the men of the Class of 1896 was thoroughly organized. The
  dinner-committee hammered like a sales-corporation. Once a week they sent out
  reminders:</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter"
     style="text-align:center">TICKLER NO. 3</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Old man, are you going to be with us at the livest
  Friendship Feed the alumni of the good old U have ever known? The alumnae of
  '08 turned out 60% strong. Are we boys going to be beaten by a bunch of
  skirts? Come on, fellows, let's work up some real genuine enthusiasm and all
  boost together for the snappiest dinner yet! Elegant eats, short
  ginger-talks, and memories shared together of the brightest, gladdest days of
  life.</p>

  <p><br>
  The dinner was held in a private room at the Union Club. The club was a dingy
  building, three pretentious old dwellings knocked together, and the
  entrance-hall resembled a potato cellar, yet the Babbitt who was free of the
  magnificence of the Athletic Club entered with embarrassment. He nodded to
  the doorman, an ancient proud negro with brass buttons and a blue tail-coat,
  and paraded through the hall, trying to look like a member.</p>

  <p>Sixty men had come to the dinner. They made islands and eddies in the
  hall; they packed the elevator and the corners of the private dining-room.
  They tried to be intimate and enthusiastic. They appeared to one another
  exactly as they had in college&mdash;as raw youngsters whose present
  mustaches, baldnesses, paunches, and wrinkles were but jovial disguises put
  on for the evening. "You haven't changed a particle!" they marveled. The men
  whom they could not recall they addressed, "Well, well, great to see you
  again, old man. What are you&mdash;Still doing the same thing?"</p>

  <p>Some one was always starting a cheer or a college song, and it was always
  thinning into silence. Despite their resolution to be democratic they divided
  into two sets: the men with dress-clothes and the men without. Babbitt
  (extremely in dress-clothes) went from one group to the other. Though he was,
  almost frankly, out for social conquest, he sought Paul Riesling first. He
  found him alone, neat and silent.</p>

  <p>Paul sighed, "I'm no good at this handshaking and 'well, look who's here'
  bunk."</p>

  <p>"Rats now, Paulibus, loosen up and be a mixer! Finest bunch of boys on
  earth! Say, you seem kind of glum. What's matter?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the usual. Run-in with Zilla."</p>

  <p>"Come on! Let's wade in and forget our troubles."</p>

  <p>He kept Paul beside him, but worked toward the spot where Charles McKelvey
  stood warming his admirers like a furnace.</p>

  <p>McKelvey had been the hero of the Class of '96; not only football captain
  and hammer-thrower but debater, and passable in what the State University
  considered scholarship. He had gone on, had captured the construction-company
  once owned by the Dodsworths, best-known pioneer family of Zenith. He built
  state capitols, skyscrapers, railway terminals. He was a heavy-shouldered,
  big-chested man, but not sluggish. There was a quiet humor in his eyes, a
  syrup-smooth quickness in his speech, which intimidated politicians and
  warned reporters; and in his presence the most intelligent scientist or the
  most sensitive artist felt thin-blooded, unworldly, and a little shabby. He
  was, particularly when he was influencing legislatures or hiring labor-spies,
  very easy and lovable and gorgeous. He was baronial; he was a peer in the
  rapidly crystallizing American aristocracy, inferior only to the haughty Old
  Families. (In Zenith, an Old Family is one which came to town before 1840.)
  His power was the greater because he was not hindered by scruples, by either
  the vice or the virtue of the older Puritan tradition.</p>

  <p>McKelvey was being placidly merry now with the great, the manufacturers
  and bankers, the land-owners and lawyers and surgeons who had chauffeurs and
  went to Europe. Babbitt squeezed among them. He liked McKelvey's smile as
  much as the social advancement to be had from his favor. If in Paul's company
  he felt ponderous and protective, with McKelvey he felt slight and
  adoring.</p>

  <p>He heard McKelvey say to Max Kruger, the banker, "Yes, we'll put up Sir
  Gerald Doak." Babbitt's democratic love for titles became a rich relish. "You
  know, he's one of the biggest iron-men in England, Max. Horribly
  well-off...Why, hello, old Georgie! Say, Max, George Babbitt is getting
  fatter than I am!"</p>

  <p>The chairman shouted, "Take your seats, fellows!"</p>

  <p>"Shall we make a move, Charley?" Babbitt said casually to McKelvey.</p>

  <p>"Right. Hello, Paul! How's the old fiddler? Planning to sit anywhere
  special, George? Come on, let's grab some seats. Come on, Max. Georgie, I
  read about your speeches in the campaign. Bully work!"</p>

  <p>After that, Babbitt would have followed him through fire. He was
  enormously busy during the dinner, now bumblingly cheering Paul, now
  approaching McKelvey with "Hear, you're going to build some piers in
  Brooklyn," now noting how enviously the failures of the class, sitting by
  themselves in a weedy group, looked up to him in his association with the
  nobility, now warming himself in the Society Talk of McKelvey and Max Kruger.
  They spoke of a "jungle dance" for which Mona Dodsworth had decorated her
  house with thousands of orchids. They spoke, with an excellent imitation of
  casualness, of a dinner in Washington at which McKelvey had met a Senator, a
  Balkan princess, and an English major-general. McKelvey called the princess
  "Jenny," and let it be known that he had danced with her.</p>

  <p>Babbitt was thrilled, but not so weighted with awe as to be silent. If he
  was not invited by them to dinner, he was yet accustomed to talking with
  bank-presidents, congressmen, and clubwomen who entertained poets. He was
  bright and referential with McKelvey:</p>

  <p>"Say, Charley, juh remember in Junior year how we chartered a sea-going
  hack and chased down to Riverdale, to the big show Madame Brown used to put
  on? Remember how you beat up that hick constabule that tried to run us in,
  and we pinched the pants-pressing sign and took and hung it on Prof.
  Morrison's door? Oh, gosh, those were the days!"</p>

  <p>Those, McKelvey agreed, were the days.</p>

  <p>Babbitt had reached "It isn't the books you study in college but the
  friendships you make that counts" when the men at head of the table broke
  into song. He attacked McKelvey:</p>

  <p>"It's a shame, uh, shame to drift apart because our, uh, business
  activities lie in different fields. I've enjoyed talking over the good old
  days. You and Mrs. McKelvey must come to dinner some night."</p>

  <p>Vaguely, "Yes, indeed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Like to talk to you about the growth of real estate out beyond your
  Grantsville warehouse. I might be able to tip you off to a thing or two,
  possibly."</p>

  <p>"Splendid! We must have dinner together, Georgie. Just let me know. And it
  will be a great pleasure to have your wife and you at the house," said
  McKelvey, much less vaguely.</p>

  <p>Then the chairman's voice, that prodigious voice which once had roused
  them to cheer defiance at rooters from Ohio or Michigan or Indiana, whooped,
  "Come on, you wombats! All together in the long yell!" Babbitt felt that life
  would never be sweeter than now, when he joined with Paul Riesling and the
  newly recovered hero, McKelvey, in:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Baaaaaattle-ax<br>
  Get an ax,<br>
  Bal-ax,<br>
  Get-nax, Who, who? The U.!<br>
  Hooroo!</p><br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">The Babbitts invited the McKelveys to dinner, in early
  December, and the McKelveys not only accepted but, after changing the date
  once or twice, actually came.</p>

  <p>The Babbitts somewhat thoroughly discussed the details of the dinner, from
  the purchase of a bottle of champagne to the number of salted almonds to be
  placed before each person. Especially did they mention the matter of the
  other guests. To the last Babbitt held out for giving Paul Riesling the
  benefit of being with the McKelveys. "Good old Charley would like Paul and
  Verg Gunch better than some highfalutin' Willy boy," he insisted, but Mrs.
  Babbitt interrupted his observations with, "Yes&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I think
  I'll try to get some Lynnhaven oysters," and when she was quite ready she
  invited Dr. J. T. Angus, the oculist, and a dismally respectable lawyer named
  Maxwell, with their glittering wives.</p>

  <p>Neither Angus nor Maxwell belonged to the Elks or to the Athletic Club;
  neither of them had ever called Babbitt "brother" or asked his opinions on
  carburetors. The only "human people" whom she invited, Babbitt raged, were
  the Littlefields; and Howard Littlefield at times became so statistical that
  Babbitt longed for the refreshment of Gunch's, "Well, old lemon-pie-face,
  what's the good word?"</p>

  <p>Immediately after lunch Mrs. Babbitt began to set the table for the
  seven-thirty dinner to the McKelveys, and Babbitt was, by order, home at
  four. But they didn't find anything for him to do, and three times Mrs.
  Babbitt scolded, "Do please try to keep out of the way!" He stood in the door
  of the garage, his lips drooping, and wished that Littlefield or Sam
  Doppelbrau or somebody would come along and talk to him. He saw Ted sneaking
  about the corner of the house.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, old man?" said Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, thin, owld one? Gee, Ma certainly is on the warpath! I told
  her Rone and I would jus' soon not be let in on the fiesta to-night, and she
  bit me. She says I got to take a bath, too. But, say, the Babbitt men will be
  some lookers to-night! Little Theodore in a dress-suit!"</p>

  <p>"The Babbitt men!" Babbitt liked the sound of it. He put his arm about the
  boy's shoulder. He wished that Paul Riesling had a daughter, so that Ted
  might marry her. "Yes, your mother is kind of rouncing round, all right," he
  said, and they laughed together, and sighed together, and dutifully went in
  to dress.</p>

  <p>The McKelveys were less than fifteen minutes late.</p>

  <p>Babbitt hoped that the Doppelbraus would see the McKelveys' limousine, and
  their uniformed chauffeur, waiting in front.</p>

  <p>The dinner was well cooked and incredibly plentiful, and Mrs. Babbitt had
  brought out her grandmother's silver candlesticks. Babbitt worked hard. He
  was good. He told none of the jokes he wanted to tell. He listened to the
  others. He started Maxwell off with a resounding, "Let's hear about your trip
  to the Yellowstone." He was laudatory, extremely laudatory. He found
  opportunities to remark that Dr. Angus was a benefactor to humanity, Maxwell
  and Howard Littlefield profound scholars, Charles McKelvey an inspiration to
  ambitious youth, and Mrs. McKelvey an adornment to the social circles of
  Zenith, Washington, New York, Paris, and numbers of other places.</p>

  <p>But he could not stir them. It was a dinner without a soul. For no reason
  that was clear to Babbitt, heaviness was over them and they spoke laboriously
  and unwillingly.</p>

  <p>He concentrated on Lucille McKelvey, carefully not looking at her blanched
  lovely shoulder and the tawny silken bared which supported her frock.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'll be going to Europe pretty soon again, won't you?" he
  invited.</p>

  <p>"I'd like awfully to run over to Rome for a few weeks."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you see a lot of pictures and music and curios and everything
  there."</p>

  <p>"No, what I really go for is: there's a little trattoria on the Via della
  Scrofa where you get the best fettuccine in the world."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I&mdash;Yes. That must be nice to try that. Yes."</p>

  <p>At a quarter to ten McKelvey discovered with profound regret that his wife
  had a headache. He said blithely, as Babbitt helped him with his coat, "We
  must lunch together some time, and talk over the old days."</p>

  <p>When the others had labored out, at half-past ten, Babbitt turned to his
  wife, pleading, "Charley said he had a corking time and we must
  lunch&mdash;said they wanted to have us up to the house for dinner before
  long."</p>

  <p>She achieved, "Oh, it's just been one of those quiet evenings that are
  often so much more enjoyable than noisy parties where everybody talks at once
  and doesn't really settle down to-nice quiet enjoyment."</p>

  <p>But from his cot on the sleeping-porch he heard her weeping, slowly,
  without hope.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">For a month they watched the social columns, and waited for
  a return dinner-invitation.</p>

  <p>As the hosts of Sir Gerald Doak, the McKelveys were headlined all the week
  after the Babbitts' dinner. Zenith ardently received Sir Gerald (who had come
  to America to buy coal). The newspapers interviewed him on prohibition,
  Ireland, unemployment, naval aviation, the rate of exchange, tea-drinking
  versus whisky-drinking, the psychology of American women, and daily life as
  lived by English county families. Sir Gerald seemed to have heard of all
  those topics. The McKelveys gave him a Singhalese dinner, and Miss Elnora
  Pearl Bates, society editor of the <i>Advocate-Times</i>, rose to her highest
  lark-note. Babbitt read aloud at breakfast-table:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">'Twixt the original and Oriental decorations, the strange
  and delicious food, and the personalities both of the distinguished guests,
  the charming hostess and the noted host, never has Zenith seen a more
  recherche affair than the Ceylon dinner-dance given last evening by Mr. and
  Mrs. Charles McKelvey to Sir Gerald Doak. Methought as we&mdash;fortunate
  one!&mdash;were privileged to view that fairy and foreign scene, nothing at
  Monte Carlo or the choicest ambassadorial sets of foreign capitals could be
  more lovely. It is not for nothing that Zenith is in matters social rapidly
  becoming known as the choosiest inland city in the country.</p>

  <p class="quote">Though he is too modest to admit it, Lord Doak gives a
  cachet to our smart quartier such as it has not received since the
  ever-memorable visit of the Earl of Sittingbourne. Not only is he of the
  British peerage, but he is also, on dit, a leader of the British metal
  industries. As he comes from Nottingham, a favorite haunt of Robin Hood,
  though now, we are informed by Lord Doak, a live modern city of 275,573
  inhabitants, and important lace as well as other industries, we like to think
  that perhaps through his veins runs some of the blood, both virile red and
  bonny blue, of that earlier lord o' the good greenwood, the roguish
  Robin.</p>

  <p class="quote">The lovely Mrs. McKelvey never was more fascinating than
  last evening in her black net gown relieved by dainty bands of silver and at
  her exquisite waist a glowing cluster of Aaron Ward roses.</p>

  <p><br>
  Babbitt said bravely, "I hope they don't invite us to meet this Lord Doak
  guy. Darn sight rather just have a nice quiet little dinner with Charley and
  the Missus."</p>

  <p>At the Zenith Athletic Club they discussed it amply. "I s'pose we'll have
  to call McKelvey 'Lord Chaz' from now on," said Sidney Finkelstein.</p>

  <p>"It beats all get-out," meditated that man of data, Howard Littlefield,
  "how hard it is for some people to get things straight. Here they call this
  fellow 'Lord Doak' when it ought to be 'Sir Gerald.'"</p>

  <p>Babbitt marvelled, "Is that a fact! Well, well! 'Sir Gerald,' eh? That's
  what you call um, eh? Well, sir, I'm glad to know that."</p>

  <p>Later he informed his salesmen, "It's funnier 'n a goat the way some folks
  that, just because they happen to lay up a big wad, go entertaining famous
  foreigners, don't have any more idea 'n a rabbit how to address 'em so's to
  make 'em feel at home!"</p>

  <p>That evening, as he was driving home, he passed McKelvey's limousine and
  saw Sir Gerald, a large, ruddy, pop-eyed, Teutonic Englishman whose dribble
  of yellow mustache gave him an aspect sad and doubtful. Babbitt drove on
  slowly, oppressed by futility. He had a sudden, unexplained, and horrible
  conviction that the McKelveys were laughing at him.</p>

  <p>He betrayed his depression by the violence with which he informed his
  wife, "Folks that really tend to business haven't got the time to waste on a
  bunch like the McKelveys. This society stuff is like any other hobby; if you
  devote yourself to it, you get on. But I like to have a chance to visit with
  you and the children instead of all this idiotic chasing round."</p>

  <p>They did not speak of the McKelveys again.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">It was a shame, at this worried time, to have to think about
  the Overbrooks.</p>

  <p>Ed Overbrook was a classmate of Babbitt who had been a failure. He had a
  large family and a feeble insurance business out in the suburb of Dorchester.
  He was gray and thin and unimportant. He had always been gray and thin and
  unimportant. He was the person whom, in any group, you forgot to introduce,
  then introduced with extra enthusiasm. He had admired Babbitt's
  good-fellowship in college, had admired ever since his power in real estate,
  his beautiful house and wonderful clothes. It pleased Babbitt, though it
  bothered him with a sense of responsibility. At the class-dinner he had seen
  poor Overbrook, in a shiny blue serge business-suit, being diffident in a
  corner with three other failures. He had gone over and been cordial: "Why,
  hello, young Ed! I hear you're writing all the insurance in Dorchester now.
  Bully work!"</p>

  <p>They recalled the good old days when Overbrook used to write poetry.
  Overbrook embarrassed him by blurting, "Say, Georgie, I hate to think of how
  we been drifting apart. I wish you and Mrs. Babbitt would come to dinner some
  night."</p>

  <p>Babbitt boomed, "Fine! Sure! Just let me know. And the wife and I want to
  have you at the house." He forgot it, but unfortunately Ed Overbrook did not.
  Repeatedly he telephoned to Babbitt, inviting him to dinner. "Might as well
  go and get it over," Babbitt groaned to his wife. "But don't it simply amaze
  you the way the poor fish doesn't know the first thing about social
  etiquette? Think of him 'phoning me, instead of his wife sitting down and
  writing us a regular bid! Well, I guess we're stuck for it. That's the
  trouble with all this class-brother hooptedoodle."</p>

  <p>He accepted Overbrook's next plaintive invitation, for an evening two
  weeks off. A dinner two weeks off, even a family dinner, never seems so
  appalling, till the two weeks have astoundingly disappeared and one comes
  dismayed to the ambushed hour. They had to change the date, because of their
  own dinner to the McKelveys, but at last they gloomily drove out to the
  Overbrooks' house in Dorchester.</p>

  <p>It was miserable from the beginning. The Overbrooks had dinner at
  six-thirty, while the Babbitts never dined before seven. Babbitt permitted
  himself to be ten minutes late. "Let's make it as short as possible. I think
  we'll duck out quick. I'll say I have to be at the office extra early
  to-morrow," he planned.</p>

  <p>The Overbrook house was depressing. It was the second story of a wooden
  two-family dwelling; a place of baby-carriages, old hats hung in the hall,
  cabbage-smell, and a Family Bible on the parlor table. Ed Overbrook and his
  wife were as awkward and threadbare as usual, and the other guests were two
  dreadful families whose names Babbitt never caught and never desired to
  catch. But he was touched, and disconcerted, by the tactless way in which
  Overbrook praised him: "We're mighty proud to have old George here to-night!
  Of course you've all read about his speeches and oratory in the
  papers&mdash;and the boy's good-looking, too, eh?&mdash;but what I always
  think of is back in college, and what a great old mixer he was, and one of
  the best swimmers in the class."</p>

  <p>Babbitt tried to be jovial; he worked at it; but he could find nothing to
  interest him in Overbrook's timorousness, the blankness of the other guests,
  or the drained stupidity of Mrs. Overbrook, with her spectacles, drab skin,
  and tight-drawn hair. He told his best Irish story, but it sank like soggy
  cake. Most bleary moment of all was when Mrs. Overbrook, peering out of her
  fog of nursing eight children and cooking and scrubbing, tried to be
  conversational.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you go to Chicago and New York right along, Mr. Babbitt," she
  prodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, I get to Chicago fairly often."</p>

  <p>"It must be awfully interesting. I suppose you take in all the
  theaters."</p>

  <p>"Well, to tell the truth, Mrs. Overbrook, thing that hits me best is a
  great big beefsteak at a Dutch restaurant in the Loop!"</p>

  <p>They had nothing more to say. Babbitt was sorry, but there was no hope;
  the dinner was a failure. At ten, rousing out of the stupor of meaningless
  talk, he said as cheerily as he could, "'Fraid we got to be starting, Ed.
  I've got a fellow coming to see me early to-morrow." As Overbrook helped him
  with his coat, Babbitt said, "Nice to rub up on the old days! We must have
  lunch together, P.D.Q."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Babbitt sighed, on their drive home, "It was pretty terrible. But how
  Mr. Overbrook does admire you!"</p>

  <p>"Yep. Poor cuss! Seems to think I'm a little tin archangel, and the
  best-looking man in Zenith."</p>

  <p>"Well, you're certainly not that but&mdash;Oh, Georgie, you don't suppose
  we have to invite them to dinner at our house now, do we?"</p>

  <p>"Ouch! Gaw, I hope not!"</p>

  <p>"See here, now, George! You didn't say anything about it to Mr. Overbrook,
  did you?"</p>

  <p>"No! Gee! No! Honest, I didn't! Just made a bluff about having him to
  lunch some time."</p>

  <p>"Well...Oh, dear...I don't want to hurt their feelings. But I don't see
  how I could stand another evening like this one. And suppose somebody like
  Dr. and Mrs. Angus came in when we had the Overbrooks there, and thought they
  were friends of ours!"</p>

  <p>For a week they worried, "We really ought to invite Ed and his wife, poor
  devils!" But as they never saw the Overbrooks, they forgot them, and after a
  month or two they said, "That really was the best way, just to let it slide.
  It wouldn't be kind to <i>them</i> to have them here. They'd feel so out of
  place and hard-up in our home."</p>

  <p>They did not speak of the Overbrooks again.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">The certainty that he was not going to be accepted by the
  McKelveys made Babbitt feel guilty and a little absurd. But he went more
  regularly to the Elks; at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon he was oratorical
  regarding the wickedness of strikes; and again he saw himself as a Prominent
  Citizen.</p>

  <p>His clubs and associations were food comfortable to his spirit.</p>

  <p>Of a decent man in Zenith it was required that he should belong to one,
  preferably two or three, of the innumerous "lodges" and prosperity-boosting
  lunch-clubs; to the Rotarians, the Kiwanis, or the Boosters; to the
  Oddfellows, Moose, Masons, Red Men, Woodmen, Owls, Eagles, Maccabees, Knights
  of Pythias, Knights of Columbus, and other secret orders characterized by a
  high degree of heartiness, sound morals, and reverence for the Constitution.
  There were four reasons for joining these orders: It was the thing to do. It
  was good for business, since lodge-brothers frequently became customers. It
  gave to Americans unable to become Geheimrate or Commendatori such unctuous
  honorifics as High Worthy Recording Scribe and Grand Hoogow to add to the
  commonplace distinctions of Colonel, Judge, and Professor. And it permitted
  the swaddled American husband to stay away from home for one evening a week.
  The lodge was his piazza, his pavement cafe. He could shoot pool and talk
  man-talk and be obscene and valiant.</p>

  <p>Babbitt was what he called a "joiner" for all these reasons.</p>

  <p>Behind the gold and scarlet banner of his public achievements was the dun
  background of office-routine: leases, sales-contracts, lists of properties to
  rent. The evenings of oratory and committees and lodges stimulated him like
  brandy, but every morning he was sandy-tongued. Week by week he accumulated
  nervousness. He was in open disagreement with his outside salesman, Stanley
  Graff; and once, though her charms had always kept him nickeringly polite to
  her, he snarled at Miss McGoun for changing his letters.</p>

  <p>But in the presence of Paul Riesling he relaxed. At least once a week they
  fled from maturity. On Saturday they played golf, jeering, "As a golfer,
  you're a fine tennis-player," or they motored all Sunday afternoon, stopping
  at village lunchrooms to sit on high stools at a counter and drink coffee
  from thick cups. Sometimes Paul came over in the evening with his violin, and
  even Zilla was silent as the lonely man who had lost his way and forever
  crept down unfamiliar roads spun out his dark soul in music.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Nothing gave Babbitt more purification and publicity than
  his labors for the Sunday School.</p>

  <p>His church, the Chatham Road Presbyterian, was one of the largest and
  richest, one of the most oaken and velvety, in Zenith. The pastor was the
  Reverend John Jennison Drew, M.A., D.D., LL.D. (The M.A. and the D.D. were
  from Elbert University, Nebraska, the LL.D. from Waterbury College,
  Oklahoma.) He was eloquent, efficient, and versatile. He presided at meetings
  for the denunciation of unions or the elevation of domestic service, and
  confided to the audiences that as a poor boy he had carried newspapers. For
  the Saturday edition of the <i>Evening Advocate</i> he wrote editorials on
  "The Manly Man's Religion" and "The Dollars and Sense Value of Christianity,"
  which were printed in bold type surrounded by a wiggly border. He often said
  that he was "proud to be known as primarily a business man" and that he
  certainly was not going to "permit the old Satan to monopolize all the pep
  and punch." He was a thin, rustic-faced young man with gold spectacles and a
  bang of dull brown hair, but when he hurled himself into oratory he glowed
  with power. He admitted that he was too much the scholar and poet to imitate
  the evangelist, Mike Monday, yet he had once awakened his fold to new life,
  and to larger collections, by the challenge, "My brethren, the real cheap
  skate is the man who won't lend to the Lord!"</p>

  <p>He had made his church a true community center. It contained everything
  but a bar. It had a nursery, a Thursday evening supper with a short bright
  missionary lecture afterward, a gymnasium, a fortnightly motion-picture show,
  a library of technical books for young workmen&mdash;though, unfortunately,
  no young workman ever entered the church except to wash the windows or repair
  the furnace&mdash;and a sewing-circle which made short little pants for the
  children of the poor while Mrs. Drew read aloud from earnest novels.</p>

  <p>Though Dr. Drew's theology was Presbyterian, his church-building was
  gracefully Episcopalian. As he said, it had the "most perdurable features of
  those noble ecclesiastical monuments of grand Old England which stand as
  symbols of the eternity of faith, religious and civil." It was built of
  cheery iron-spot brick in an improved Gothic style, and the main auditorium
  had indirect lighting from electric globes in lavish alabaster bowls.</p>

  <p>On a December morning when the Babbitts went to church, Dr. John Jennison
  Drew was unusually eloquent. The crowd was immense. Ten brisk young ushers,
  in morning coats with white roses, were bringing folding chairs up from the
  basement. There was an impressive musical program, conducted by Sheldon
  Smeeth, educational director of the Y.M.C.A., who also sang the offertory.
  Babbitt cared less for this, because some misguided person had taught young
  Mr. Smeeth to smile, smile, smile while he was singing, but with all the
  appreciation of a fellow-orator he admired Dr. Drew's sermon. It had the
  intellectual quality which distinguished the Chatham Road congregation from
  the grubby chapels on Smith Street.</p>

  <p>"At this abundant harvest-time of all the year," Dr. Drew chanted, "when,
  though stormy the sky and laborious the path to the drudging wayfarer, yet
  the hovering and bodiless spirit swoops back o'er all the labors and desires
  of the past twelve months, oh, then it seems to me there sounds behind all
  our apparent failures the golden chorus of greeting from those passed happily
  on; and lo! on the dim horizon we see behind dolorous clouds the mighty mass
  of mountains&mdash;mountains of melody, mountains of mirth, mountains of
  might!"</p>

  <p>"I certainly do like a sermon with culture and thought in it," meditated
  Babbitt.</p>

  <p>At the end of the service he was delighted when the pastor, actively
  shaking hands at the door, twittered, "Oh, Brother Babbitt, can you wait a
  jiffy? Want your advice."</p>

  <p>"Sure, doctor! You bet!"</p>

  <p>"Drop into my office. I think you'll like the cigars there." Babbitt did
  like the cigars. He also liked the office, which was distinguished from other
  offices only by the spirited change of the familiar wall-placard to "This is
  the Lord's Busy Day." Chum Frink came in, then William W. Eathorne.</p>

  <p>Mr. Eathorne was the seventy-year-old president of the First State Bank of
  Zenith. He still wore the delicate patches of side-whiskers which had been
  the uniform of bankers in 1870. If Babbitt was envious of the Smart Set of
  the McKelveys, before William Washington Eathorne he was reverent. Mr.
  Eathorne had nothing to do with the Smart Set. He was above it. He was the
  great-grandson of one of the five men who founded Zenith, in 1792, and he was
  of the third generation of bankers. He could examine credits, make loans,
  promote or injure a man's business. In his presence Babbitt breathed quickly
  and felt young.</p>

  <p>The Reverend Dr. Drew bounced into the room and flowered into speech:</p>

  <p>"I've asked you gentlemen to stay so I can put a proposition before you.
  The Sunday School needs bucking up. It's the fourth largest in Zenith, but
  there's no reason why we should take anybody's dust. We ought to be first. I
  want to request you, if you will, to form a committee of advice and publicity
  for the Sunday School; look it over and make any suggestions for its
  betterment, and then, perhaps, see that the press gives us some
  attention&mdash;give the public some really helpful and constructive news
  instead of all these murders and divorces."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," said the banker.</p>

  <p>Babbitt and Frink were enchanted to join him.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">If you had asked Babbitt what his religion was, he would
  have answered in sonorous Boosters'-Club rhetoric, "My religion is to serve
  my fellow men, to honor my brother as myself, and to do my bit to make life
  happier for one and all." If you had pressed him for more detail, he would
  have announced, "I'm a member of the Presbyterian Church, and naturally, I
  accept its doctrines." If you had been so brutal as to go on, he would have
  protested, "There's no use discussing and arguing about religion; it just
  stirs up bad feeling."</p>

  <p>Actually, the content of his theology was that there was a supreme being
  who had tried to make us perfect, but presumably had failed; that if one was
  a Good Man he would go to a place called Heaven (Babbitt unconsciously
  pictured it as rather like an excellent hotel with a private garden), but if
  one was a Bad Man, that is, if he murdered or committed burglary or used
  cocaine or had mistresses or sold non-existent real estate, he would be
  punished. Babbitt was uncertain, however, about what he called "this business
  of Hell." He explained to Ted, "Of course I'm pretty liberal; I don't exactly
  believe in a fire-and-brimstone Hell. Stands to reason, though, that a fellow
  can't get away with all sorts of Vice and not get nicked for it, see how I
  mean?"</p>

  <p>Upon this theology he rarely pondered. The kernel of his practical
  religion was that it was respectable, and beneficial to one's business, to be
  seen going to services; that the church kept the Worst Elements from being
  still worse; and that the pastor's sermons, however dull they might seem at
  the time of taking, yet had a voodooistic power which "did a fellow
  good&mdash;kept him in touch with Higher Things."</p>

  <p>His first investigations for the Sunday School Advisory Committee did not
  inspire him.</p>

  <p>He liked the Busy Folks' Bible Class, composed of mature men and women and
  addressed by the old-school physician, Dr. T. Atkins Jordan, in a sparkling
  style comparable to that of the more refined humorous after-dinner speakers,
  but when he went down to the junior classes he was disconcerted. He heard
  Sheldon Smeeth, educational director of the Y.M.C.A. and leader of the
  church-choir, a pale but strenuous young man with curly hair and a smile,
  teaching a class of sixteen-year-old boys. Smeeth lovingly admonished them,
  "Now, fellows, I'm going to have a Heart to Heart Talk Evening at my house
  next Thursday. We'll get off by ourselves and be frank about our Secret
  Worries. You can just tell old Sheldy anything, like all the fellows do at
  the Y. I'm going to explain frankly about the horrible practises a kiddy
  falls into unless he's guided by a Big Brother, and about the perils and
  glory of Sex." Old Sheldy beamed damply; the boys looked ashamed; and Babbitt
  didn't know which way to turn his embarrassed eyes.</p>

  <p>Less annoying but also much duller were the minor classes which were being
  instructed in philosophy and Oriental ethnology by earnest spinsters. Most of
  them met in the highly varnished Sunday School room, but there was an
  overflow to the basement, which was decorated with varicose water-pipes and
  lighted by small windows high up in the oozing wall. What Babbitt saw,
  however, was the First Congregational Church of Catawba. He was back in the
  Sunday School of his boyhood. He smelled again that polite stuffiness to be
  found only in church parlors; he recalled the case of drab Sunday School
  books: "Hetty, a Humble Heroine" and "Josephus, a Lad of Palestine;" he
  thumbed once more the high-colored text-cards which no boy wanted but no boy
  liked to throw away, because they were somehow sacred; he was tortured by the
  stumbling rote of thirty-five years ago, as in the vast Zenith church he
  listened to:</p>

  <p>"Now, Edgar, you read the next verse. What does it mean when it says it's
  easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye? What does this teach us?
  Clarence! Please don't wiggle so! If you had studied your lesson you wouldn't
  be so fidgety. Now, Earl, what is the lesson Jesus was trying to teach his
  disciples? The one thing I want you to especially remember, boys, is the
  words, 'With God all things are possible.' Just think of that
  always&mdash;Clarence, <i>please</i> pay attention&mdash;just say 'With God
  all things are possible' whenever you feel discouraged, and, Alec, will you
  read the next verse; if you'd pay attention you wouldn't lose your
  place!"</p>

  <p>Drone&mdash;drone&mdash;drone&mdash;gigantic bees that boomed in a cavern
  of drowsiness&mdash;</p>

  <p>Babbitt started from his open-eyed nap, thanked the teacher for "the
  privilege of listening to her splendid teaching," and staggered on to the
  next circle.</p>

  <p>After two weeks of this he had no suggestions whatever for the Reverend
  Dr. Drew.</p>

  <p>Then he discovered a world of Sunday School journals, an enormous and busy
  domain of weeklies and monthlies which were as technical, as practical and
  forward-looking, as the real-estate columns or the shoe-trade magazines. He
  bought half a dozen of them at a religious book-shop and till after midnight
  he read them and admired.</p>

  <p>He found many lucrative tips on "Focusing Appeals," "Scouting for New
  Members," and "Getting Prospects to Sign up with the Sunday School." He
  particularly liked the word "prospects," and he was moved by the rubric:</p>

  <p>"The moral springs of the community's life lie deep in its Sunday
  Schools&mdash;its schools of religious instruction and inspiration. Neglect
  now means loss of spiritual vigor and moral power in years to come...Facts
  like the above, followed by a straight-arm appeal, will reach folks who can
  never be laughed or jollied into doing their part."</p>

  <p>Babbitt admitted, "That's so. I used to skin out of the ole Sunday School
  at Catawba every chance I got, but same time, I wouldn't be where I am
  to-day, maybe, if it hadn't been for its training in&mdash;in moral power.
  And all about the Bible. (Great literature. Have to read some of it again,
  one of these days)."</p>

  <p>How scientifically the Sunday School could be organized he learned from an
  article in the Westminster Adult Bible Class:</p>

  <p>"The second vice-president looks after the fellowship of the class. She
  chooses a group to help her. These become ushers. Every one who comes gets a
  glad hand. No one goes away a stranger. One member of the group stands on the
  doorstep and invites passers-by to come in."</p>

  <p>Perhaps most of all Babbitt appreciated the remarks by William H. Ridgway
  in the <i>Sunday School Times</i>:</p>

  <p>"If you have a Sunday School class without any pep and get-up-and-go in
  it, that is, without interest, that is uncertain in attendance, that acts
  like a fellow with the spring fever, let old Dr. Ridgway write you a
  prescription. Rx. Invite the Bunch for Supper."</p>

  <p>The Sunday School journals were as well rounded as they were practical.
  They neglected none of the arts. As to music the <i>Sunday School Times</i>
  advertised that C. Harold Lowden, "known to thousands through his sacred
  compositions," had written a new masterpiece, "entitled 'Yearning for You.'
  The poem, by Harry D. Kerr, is one of the daintiest you could imagine and the
  music is indescribably beautiful. Critics are agreed that it will sweep the
  country. May be made into a charming sacred song by substituting the hymn
  words, 'I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say.'"</p>

  <p>Even manual training was adequately considered. Babbitt noted an ingenious
  way of illustrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</p>

  <p>"Model for Pupils to Make. Tomb with Rolling Door.&mdash;Use a square
  covered box turned upside down. Pull the cover forward a little to form a
  groove at the bottom. Cut a square door, also cut a circle of cardboard to
  more than cover the door. Cover the circular door and the tomb thickly with
  stiff mixture of sand, flour and water and let it dry. It was the heavy
  circular stone over the door the women found 'rolled away' on Easter morning.
  This is the story we are to 'Go-tell.'"</p>

  <p>In their advertisements the Sunday School journals were thoroughly
  efficient. Babbitt was interested in a preparation which "takes the place of
  exercise for sedentary men by building up depleted nerve tissue, nourishing
  the brain and the digestive system." He was edified to learn that the selling
  of Bibles was a hustling and strictly competitive industry, and as an expert
  on hygiene he was pleased by the Sanitary Communion Outfit Company's
  announcement of "an improved and satisfactory outfit throughout, including
  highly polished beautiful mahogany tray. This tray eliminates all noise, is
  lighter and more easily handled than others and is more in keeping with the
  furniture of the church than a tray of any other material."</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">He dropped the pile of Sunday School journals.</p>

  <p>He pondered, "Now, there's a real he-world. Corking!</p>

  <p>"Ashamed I haven't sat in more. Fellow that's an influence in the
  community&mdash;shame if he doesn't take part in a real virile hustling
  religion. Sort of Christianity Incorporated, you might say.</p>

  <p>"But with all reverence.</p>

  <p>"Some folks might claim these Sunday School fans are undignified and
  unspiritual and so on. Sure! Always some skunk to spring things like that!
  Knocking and sneering and tearing-down&mdash;so much easier than building up.
  But me, I certainly hand it to these magazines. They've brought ole George F.
  Babbitt into camp, and that's the answer to the critics!</p>

  <p>"The more manly and practical a fellow is, the more he ought to lead the
  enterprising Christian life. Me for it! Cut out this carelessness and boozing
  and&mdash;Rone! Where the devil you been? This is a fine time o' night to be
  coming in!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">There are but three or four old houses in Floral Heights,
  and in Floral Heights an old house is one which was built before 1880. The
  largest of these is the residence of William Washington Eathorne, president
  of the First State Bank.</p>

  <p>The Eathorne Mansion preserves the memory of the "nice parts" of Zenith as
  they appeared from 1860 to 1900. It is a red brick immensity with gray
  sandstone lintels and a roof of slate in courses of red, green, and dyspeptic
  yellow. There are two anemic towers, one roofed with copper, the other
  crowned with castiron ferns. The porch is like an open tomb; it is supported
  by squat granite pillars above which hang frozen cascades of brick. At one
  side of the house is a huge stained-glass window in the shape of a
  keyhole.</p>

  <p>But the house has an effect not at all humorous. It embodies the heavy
  dignity of those Victorian financiers who ruled the generation between the
  pioneers and the brisk "sales-engineers" and created a somber oligarchy by
  gaining control of banks, mills, land, railroads, mines. Out of the dozen
  contradictory Zeniths which together make up the true and complete Zenith,
  none is so powerful and enduring yet none so unfamiliar to the citizens as
  the small, still, dry, polite, cruel Zenith of the William Eathornes; and for
  that tiny hierarchy the other Zeniths unwittingly labor and insignificantly
  die.</p>

  <p>Most of the castles of the testy Victorian tetrarchs are gone now or
  decayed into boarding-houses, but the Eathorne Mansion remains virtuous and
  aloof, reminiscent of London, Back Bay, Rittenhouse Square. Its marble steps
  are scrubbed daily, the brass plate is reverently polished, and the lace
  curtains are as prim and superior as William Washington Eathorne himself.</p>

  <p>With a certain awe Babbitt and Chum Frink called on Eathorne for a meeting
  of the Sunday School Advisory Committee; with uneasy stillness they followed
  a uniformed maid through catacombs of reception-rooms to the library. It was
  as unmistakably the library of a solid old banker as Eathorne's side-whiskers
  were the side-whiskers of a solid old banker. The books were most of them
  Standard Sets, with the correct and traditional touch of dim blue, dim gold,
  and glossy calf-skin. The fire was exactly correct and traditional; a small,
  quiet, steady fire, reflected by polished fire-irons. The oak desk was dark
  and old and altogether perfect; the chairs were gently supercilious.</p>

  <p>Eathorne's inquiries as to the healths of Mrs. Babbitt, Miss Babbitt, and
  the Other Children were softly paternal, but Babbitt had nothing with which
  to answer him. It was indecent to think of using the "How's tricks, ole
  socks?" which gratified Vergil Gunch and Frink and Howard
  Littlefield&mdash;men who till now had seemed successful and urbane. Babbitt
  and Frink sat politely, and politely did Eathorne observe, opening his thin
  lips just wide enough to dismiss the words, "Gentlemen, before we begin our
  conference&mdash;you may have felt the cold in coming here&mdash;so good of
  you to save an old man the journey&mdash;shall we perhaps have a whisky
  toddy?"</p>

  <p>So well trained was Babbitt in all the conversation that befits a Good
  Fellow that he almost disgraced himself with "Rather than make trouble, and
  always providin' there ain't any enforcement officers hiding in the
  waste-basket&mdash;" The words died choking in his throat. He bowed in
  flustered obedience. So did Chum Frink.</p>

  <p>Eathorne rang for the maid.</p>

  <p>The modern and luxurious Babbitt had never seen any one ring for a servant
  in a private house, except during meals. Himself, in hotels, had rung for
  bell-boys, but in the house you didn't hurt Matilda's feelings; you went out
  in the hall and shouted for her. Nor had he, since prohibition, known any one
  to be casual about drinking. It was extraordinary merely to sip his toddy and
  not cry, "Oh, maaaaan, this hits me right where I live!" And always, with the
  ecstasy of youth meeting greatness, he marveled, "That little fuzzy-face
  there, why, he could make me or break me! If he told my banker to call my
  loans&mdash;! Gosh! That quarter-sized squirt! And looking like he hadn't got
  a single bit of hustle to him! I wonder&mdash;Do we Boosters throw too many
  fits about pep?"</p>

  <p>From this thought he shuddered away, and listened devoutly to Eathorne's
  ideas on the advancement of the Sunday School, which were very clear and very
  bad.</p>

  <p>Diffidently Babbitt outlined his own suggestions:</p>

  <p>"I think if you analyze the needs of the school, in fact, going right at
  it as if it was a merchandizing problem, of course the one basic and
  fundamental need is growth. I presume we're all agreed we won't be satisfied
  till we build up the biggest darn Sunday School in the whole state, so the
  Chatham Road Presbyterian won't have to take anything off anybody. Now about
  jazzing up the campaign for prospects: they've already used contesting teams,
  and given prizes to the kids that bring in the most members. And they made a
  mistake there: the prizes were a lot of folderols and doodads like poetry
  books and illustrated Testaments, instead of something a real live kid would
  want to work for, like real cash or a speedometer for his motor cycle. Course
  I suppose it's all fine and dandy to illustrate the lessons with these
  decorated book-marks and blackboard drawings and so on, but when it comes
  down to real he-hustling, getting out and drumming up customers&mdash;or
  members, I mean, why, you got to make it worth a fellow's while.</p>

  <p>"Now, I want to propose two stunts: First, divide the Sunday School into
  four armies, depending on age. Everybody gets a military rank in his own army
  according to how many members he brings in, and the duffers that lie down on
  us and don't bring in any, they remain privates. The pastor and
  superintendent rank as generals. And everybody has got to give salutes and
  all the rest of that junk, just like a regular army, to make 'em feel it's
  worth while to get rank.</p>

  <p>"Then, second: Course the school has its advertising committee, but, Lord,
  nobody ever really works good&mdash;nobody works well just for the love of
  it. The thing to do is to be practical and up-to-date, and hire a real paid
  press-agent for the Sunday School&mdash;some newspaper fellow who can give
  part of his time."</p>

  <p>"Sure, you bet!" said Chum Frink.</p>

  <p>"Think of the nice juicy bits he could get in!" Babbitt crowed. "Not only
  the big, salient, vital facts, about how fast the Sunday School&mdash;and the
  collection&mdash;is growing, but a lot of humorous gossip and kidding: about
  how some blowhard fell down on his pledge to get new members, or the good
  time the Sacred Trinity class of girls had at their wieniewurst party. And on
  the side, if he had time, the press-agent might even boost the lessons
  themselves&mdash;do a little advertising for all the Sunday Schools in town,
  in fact. No use being hoggish toward the rest of 'em, providing we can keep
  the bulge on 'em in membership. Frinstance, he might get the papers
  to&mdash;Course I haven't got a literary training like Frink here, and I'm
  just guessing how the pieces ought to be written, but take frinstance,
  suppose the week's lesson is about Jacob; well, the press-agent might get in
  something that would have a fine moral, and yet with a trick headline that'd
  get folks to read it&mdash;say like: <i>Jake Fools the Old Man; Makes Getaway
  with Girl and Bankroll</i>. See how I mean? That'd get their interest! Now,
  course, Mr. Eathorne, you're conservative, and maybe you feel these stunts
  would be undignified, but honestly, I believe they'd bring home the
  bacon."</p>

  <p>Eathorne folded his hands on his comfortable little belly and purred like
  an aged pussy:</p>

  <p>"May I say, first, that I have been very much pleased by your analysis of
  the situation, Mr. Babbitt. As you surmise, it's necessary in My Position to
  be conservative, and perhaps endeavor to maintain a certain standard of
  dignity. Yet I think you'll find me somewhat progressive. In our bank, for
  example, I hope I may say that we have as modern a method of publicity and
  advertising as any in the city. Yes, I fancy you'll find us oldsters quite
  cognizant of the shifting spiritual values of the age. Yes, oh yes. And so,
  in fact, it pleases me to be able to say that though personally I might
  prefer the sterner Presbyterianism of an earlier era&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Babbitt finally gathered that Eathorne was willing.</p>

  <p>Chum Frink suggested as part-time press-agent one Kenneth Escott, reporter
  on the <i>Advocate-Times</i>.</p>

  <p>They parted on a high plane of amity and Christian helpfulness.</p>

  <p>Babbitt did not drive home, but toward the center of the city. He wished
  to be by himself and exult over the beauty of intimacy with William
  Washington Eathorne.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">A snow-blanched evening of ringing pavements and eager
  lights.</p>

  <p>Great golden lights of trolley-cars sliding along the packed snow of the
  roadway. Demure lights of little houses. The belching glare of a distant
  foundry, wiping out the sharp-edged stars. Lights of neighborhood drug stores
  where friends gossiped, well pleased, after the day's work.</p>

  <p>The green light of a police-station, and greener radiance on the snow; the
  drama of a patrol-wagon&mdash;gong beating like a terrified heart, headlights
  scorching the crystal-sparkling street, driver not a chauffeur but a
  policeman proud in uniform, another policeman perilously dangling on the step
  at the back, and a glimpse of the prisoner. A murderer, a burglar, a coiner
  cleverly trapped?</p>

  <p>An enormous graystone church with a rigid spire; dim light in the Parlors,
  and cheerful droning of choir-practise. The quivering green mercury-vapor
  light of a photo-engraver's loft. Then the storming lights of down-town;
  parked cars with ruby tail-lights; white arched entrances to movie theaters,
  like frosty mouths of winter caves; electric signs&mdash;serpents and little
  dancing men of fire; pink-shaded globes and scarlet jazz music in a cheap
  up-stairs dance-hall; lights of Chinese restaurants, lanterns painted with
  cherry-blossoms and with pagodas, hung against lattices of lustrous gold and
  black. Small dirty lamps in small stinking lunchrooms. The smart
  shopping-district, with rich and quiet light on crystal pendants and furs and
  suave surfaces of polished wood in velvet-hung reticent windows. High above
  the street, an unexpected square hanging in the darkness, the window of an
  office where some one was working late, for a reason unknown and stimulating.
  A man meshed in bankruptcy, an ambitious boy, an oil-man suddenly become
  rich?</p>

  <p>The air was shrewd, the snow was deep in uncleared alleys, and beyond the
  city, Babbitt knew, were hillsides of snow-drift among wintry oaks, and the
  curving ice-enchanted river.</p>

  <p>He loved his city with passionate wonder. He lost the accumulated
  weariness of business&mdash;worry and expansive oratory; he felt young and
  potential. He was ambitious. It was not enough to be a Vergil Gunch, an
  Orville Jones. No. "They're bully fellows, simply lovely, but they haven't
  got any finesse." No. He was going to be an Eathorne; delicately rigorous,
  coldly powerful.</p>

  <p>"That's the stuff. The wallop in the velvet mitt. Not let anybody get
  fresh with you. Been getting careless about my diction. Slang. Colloquial.
  Cut it out. I was first-rate at rhetoric in college. Themes on&mdash;Anyway,
  not bad. Had too much of this hooptedoodle and good-fellow stuff. I&mdash;Why
  couldn't I organize a bank of my own some day? And Ted succeed me!"</p>

  <p>He drove happily home, and to Mrs. Babbitt he was a William Washington
  Eathorne, but she did not notice it.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Young Kenneth Escott, reporter on the <i>Advocate-Times</i>
  was appointed press-agent of the Chatham Road Presbyterian Sunday School. He
  gave six hours a week to it. At least he was paid for giving six hours a
  week. He had friends on the Press and the Gazette and he was not (officially)
  known as a press-agent. He procured a trickle of insinuating items about
  neighborliness and the Bible, about class-suppers, jolly but educational, and
  the value of the Prayer-life in attaining financial success.</p>

  <p>The Sunday School adopted Babbitt's system of military ranks. Quickened by
  this spiritual refreshment, it had a boom. It did not become the largest
  school in Zenith&mdash;the Central Methodist Church kept ahead of it by
  methods which Dr. Drew scored as "unfair, undignified, un-American,
  ungentlemanly, and unchristian"&mdash;but it climbed from fourth place to
  second, and there was rejoicing in heaven, or at least in that portion of
  heaven included in the parsonage of Dr. Drew, while Babbitt had much praise
  and good repute.</p>

  <p>He had received the rank of colonel on the general staff of the school. He
  was plumply pleased by salutes on the street from unknown small boys; his
  ears were tickled to ruddy ecstasy by hearing himself called "Colonel;" and
  if he did not attend Sunday School merely to be thus exalted, certainly he
  thought about it all the way there.</p>

  <p>He was particularly pleasant to the press-agent, Kenneth Escott; he took
  him to lunch at the Athletic Club and had him at the house for dinner.</p>

  <p>Like many of the cocksure young men who forage about cities in apparent
  contentment and who express their cynicism in supercilious slang, Escott was
  shy and lonely. His shrewd starveling face broadened with joy at dinner, and
  he blurted, "Gee whillikins, Mrs. Babbitt, if you knew how good it is to have
  home eats again!"</p>

  <p>Escott and Verona liked each other. All evening they "talked about ideas."
  They discovered that they were Radicals. True, they were sensible about it.
  They agreed that all communists were criminals; that this vers libre was
  tommy-rot; and that while there ought to be universal disarmament, of course
  Great Britain and the United States must, on behalf of oppressed small
  nations, keep a navy equal to the tonnage of all the rest of the world. But
  they were so revolutionary that they predicted (to Babbitt's irritation) that
  there would some day be a Third Party which would give trouble to the
  Republicans and Democrats.</p>

  <p>Escott shook hands with Babbitt three times, at parting.</p>

  <p>Babbitt mentioned his extreme fondness for Eathorne.</p>

  <p>Within a week three newspapers presented accounts of Babbitt's sterling
  labors for religion, and all of them tactfully mentioned William Washington
  Eathorne as his collaborator.</p>

  <p>Nothing had brought Babbitt quite so much credit at the Elks, the Athletic
  Club, and the Boosters'. His friends had always congratulated him on his
  oratory, but in their praise was doubt, for even in speeches advertising the
  city there was something highbrow and degenerate, like writing poetry. But
  now Orville Jones shouted across the Athletic dining-room, "Here's the new
  director of the First State Bank!" Grover Butterbaugh, the eminent wholesaler
  of plumbers' supplies, chuckled, "Wonder you mix with common folks, after
  holding Eathorne's hand!" And Emil Wengert, the jeweler, was at last willing
  to discuss buying a house in Dorchester.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">When the Sunday School campaign was finished, Babbitt
  suggested to Kenneth Escott, "Say, how about doing a little boosting for Doc
  Drew personally?"</p>

  <p>Escott grinned. "You trust the doc to do a little boosting for himself,
  Mr. Babbitt! There's hardly a week goes by without his ringing up the paper
  to say if we'll chase a reporter up to his Study, he'll let us in on the
  story about the swell sermon he's going to preach on the wickedness of short
  skirts, or the authorship of the Pentateuch. Don't you worry about him.
  There's just one better publicity-grabber in town, and that's this Dora
  Gibson Tucker that runs the Child Welfare and the Americanization League, and
  the only reason she's got Drew beaten is because she has got <i>some</i>
  brains!"</p>

  <p>"Well, now Kenneth, I don't think you ought to talk that way about the
  doctor. A preacher has to watch his interests, hasn't he? You remember that
  in the Bible about&mdash;about being diligent in the Lord's business, or
  something?"</p>

  <p>"All right, I'll get something in if you want me to, Mr. Babbitt, but I'll
  have to wait till the managing editor is out of town, and then blackjack the
  city editor."</p>

  <p>Thus it came to pass that in the Sunday <i>Advocate-Times</i>, under a
  picture of Dr. Drew at his earnestest, with eyes alert, jaw as granite, and
  rustic lock flamboyant, appeared an inscription&mdash;a wood-pulp tablet
  conferring twenty-four hours' immortality:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">The Rev. Dr. John Jennison Drew, M.A., pastor of the
  beautiful Chatham Road Presbyterian Church in lovely Floral Heights, is a
  wizard soul-winner. He holds the local record for conversions. During his
  shepherdhood an average of almost a hundred sin-weary persons per year have
  declared their resolve to lead a new life and have found a harbor of refuge
  and peace.</p>

  <p class="quote">Everything zips at the Chatham Road Church. The subsidiary
  organizations are keyed to the top-notch of efficiency. Dr. Drew is
  especially keen on good congregational singing. Bright cheerful hymns are
  used at every meeting, and the special Sing Services attract lovers of music
  and professionals from all parts of the city.</p>

  <p class="quote">On the popular lecture platform as well as in the pulpit Dr.
  Drew is a renowned word-painter, and during the course of the year he
  receives literally scores of invitations to speak at varied functions both
  here and elsewhere.</p><br>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">Babbitt let Dr. Drew know that he was responsible for this
  tribute. Dr. Drew called him "brother," and shook his hand a great many
  times.</p>

  <p>During the meetings of the Advisory Committee, Babbitt had hinted that he
  would be charmed to invite Eathorne to dinner, but Eathorne had murmured, "So
  nice of you&mdash;old man, now&mdash;almost never go out." Surely Eathorne
  would not refuse his own pastor. Babbitt said boyishly to Drew:</p>

  <p>"Say, doctor, now we've put this thing over, strikes me it's up to the
  dominie to blow the three of us to a dinner!"</p>

  <p>"Bully! You bet! Delighted!" cried Dr. Drew, in his manliest way. (Some
  one had once told him that he talked like the late President Roosevelt.)</p>

  <p>"And, uh, say, doctor, be sure and get Mr. Eathorne to come. Insist on it.
  It's, uh&mdash;I think he sticks around home too much for his own
  health."</p>

  <p>Eathorne came.</p>

  <p>It was a friendly dinner. Babbitt spoke gracefully of the stabilizing and
  educational value of bankers to the community. They were, he said, the
  pastors of the fold of commerce. For the first time Eathorne departed from
  the topic of Sunday Schools, and asked Babbitt about the progress of his
  business. Babbitt answered modestly, almost filially.</p>

  <p>A few months later, when he had a chance to take part in the Street
  Traction Company's terminal deal, Babbitt did not care to go to his own bank
  for a loan. It was rather a quiet sort of deal and, if it had come out, the
  Public might not have understood. He went to his friend Mr. Eathorne; he was
  welcomed, and received the loan as a private venture; and they both profited
  in their pleasant new association.</p>

  <p>After that, Babbitt went to church regularly, except on spring Sunday
  mornings which were obviously meant for motoring. He announced to Ted, "I
  tell you, boy, there's no stronger bulwark of sound conservatism than the
  evangelical church, and no better place to make friends who'll help you to
  gain your rightful place in the community than in your own church-home!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">Though he saw them twice daily, though he knew and amply
  discussed every detail of their expenditures, yet for weeks together Babbitt
  was no more conscious of his children than of the buttons on his
  coat-sleeves.</p>

  <p>The admiration of Kenneth Escott made him aware of Verona.</p>

  <p>She had become secretary to Mr. Gruensberg of the Gruensberg Leather
  Company; she did her work with the thoroughness of a mind which reveres
  details and never quite understands them; but she was one of the people who
  give an agitating impression of being on the point of doing something
  desperate&mdash;of leaving a job or a husband&mdash;without ever doing it.
  Babbitt was so hopeful about Escott's hesitant ardors that he became the
  playful parent. When he returned from the Elks he peered coyly into the
  living-room and gurgled, "Has our Kenny been here to-night?" He never
  credited Verona's protest, "Why, Ken and I are just good friends, and we only
  talk about Ideas. I won't have all this sentimental nonsense, that would
  spoil everything."</p>

  <p>It was Ted who most worried Babbitt.</p>

  <p>With conditions in Latin and English but with a triumphant record in
  manual training, basket-ball, and the organization of dances, Ted was
  struggling through his Senior year in the East Side High School. At home he
  was interested only when he was asked to trace some subtle ill in the
  ignition system of the car. He repeated to his tut-tutting father that he did
  not wish to go to college or law-school, and Babbitt was equally disturbed by
  this "shiftlessness" and by Ted's relations with Eunice Littlefield, next
  door.</p>

  <p>Though she was the daughter of Howard Littlefield, that wrought-iron
  fact-mill, that horse-faced priest of private ownership, Eunice was a midge
  in the sun. She danced into the house, she flung herself into Babbitt's lap
  when he was reading, she crumpled his paper, and laughed at him when he
  adequately explained that he hated a crumpled newspaper as he hated a broken
  sales-contract. She was seventeen now. Her ambition was to be a cinema
  actress. She did not merely attend the showing of every "feature film;" she
  also read the motion-picture magazines, those extraordinary symptoms of the
  Age of Pep-monthlies and weeklies gorgeously illustrated with portraits of
  young women who had recently been manicure girls, not very skilful manicure
  girls, and who, unless their every grimace had been arranged by a director,
  could not have acted in the Easter cantata of the Central Methodist Church;
  magazines reporting, quite seriously, in "interviews" plastered with pictures
  of riding-breeches and California bungalows, the views on sculpture and
  international politics of blankly beautiful, suspiciously beautiful young
  men; outlining the plots of films about pure prostitutes and kind-hearted
  train-robbers; and giving directions for making bootblacks into Celebrated
  Scenario Authors overnight.</p>

  <p>These authorities Eunice studied. She could, she frequently did, tell
  whether it was in November or December, 1905, that Mack Harker? the renowned
  screen cowpuncher and badman, began his public career as chorus man in "Oh,
  You Naughty Girlie." On the wall of her room, her father reported, she had
  pinned up twenty-one photographs of actors. But the signed portrait of the
  most graceful of the movie heroes she carried in her young bosom.</p>

  <p>Babbitt was bewildered by this worship of new gods, and he suspected that
  Eunice smoked cigarettes. He smelled the cloying reek from up-stairs, and
  heard her giggling with Ted. He never inquired. The agreeable child dismayed
  him. Her thin and charming face was sharpened by bobbed hair; her skirts were
  short, her stockings were rolled, and, as she flew after Ted, above the
  caressing silk were glimpses of soft knees which made Babbitt uneasy, and
  wretched that she should consider him old. Sometimes, in the veiled life of
  his dreams, when the fairy child came running to him she took on the
  semblance of Eunice Littlefield.</p>

  <p>Ted was motor-mad as Eunice was movie-mad.</p>

  <p>A thousand sarcastic refusals did not check his teasing for a car of his
  own. However lax he might be about early rising and the prosody of Vergil, he
  was tireless in tinkering. With three other boys he bought a rheumatic Ford
  chassis, built an amazing racer-body out of tin and pine, went skidding round
  corners in the perilous craft, and sold it at a profit. Babbitt gave him a
  motor-cycle, and every Saturday afternoon, with seven sandwiches and a bottle
  of Coca-Cola in his pockets, and Eunice perched eerily on the rumble seat, he
  went roaring off to distant towns.</p>

  <p>Usually Eunice and he were merely neighborhood chums, and quarreled with a
  wholesome and violent lack of delicacy; but now and then, after the color and
  scent of a dance, they were silent together and a little furtive, and Babbitt
  was worried.</p>

  <p>Babbitt was an average father. He was affectionate, bullying, opinionated,
  ignorant, and rather wistful. Like most parents, he enjoyed the game of
  waiting till the victim was clearly wrong, then virtuously pouncing. He
  justified himself by croaking, "Well, Ted's mother spoils him. Got to be
  somebody who tells him what's what, and me, I'm elected the goat. Because I
  try to bring him up to be a real, decent, human being and not one of these
  sapheads and lounge-lizards, of course they all call me a grouch!"</p>

  <p>Throughout, with the eternal human genius for arriving by the worst
  possible routes at surprisingly tolerable goals, Babbitt loved his son and
  warmed to his companionship and would have sacrificed everything for
  him&mdash;if he could have been sure of proper credit.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Ted was planning a party for his set in the Senior
  Class.</p>

  <p>Babbitt meant to be helpful and jolly about it. From his memory of
  high-school pleasures back in Catawba he suggested the nicest games: Going to
  Boston, and charades with stew-pans for helmets, and word-games in which you
  were an Adjective or a Quality. When he was most enthusiastic he discovered
  that they weren't paying attention; they were only tolerating him. As for the
  party, it was as fixed and standardized as a Union Club Hop. There was to be
  dancing in the living-room, a noble collation in the dining-room, and in the
  hall two tables of bridge for what Ted called "the poor old dumb-bells that
  you can't get to dance hardly more 'n half the time."</p>

  <p>Every breakfast was monopolized by conferences on the affair. No one
  listened to Babbitt's bulletins about the February weather or to his
  throat-clearing comments on the headlines. He said furiously, "If I may be
  <i>permitted</i> to interrupt your engrossing private
  <i>conversation</i>&mdash;Juh hear what I <i>said</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be a spoiled baby! Ted and I have just as much right to talk as
  you have!" flared Mrs. Babbitt.</p>

  <p>On the night of the party he was permitted to look on, when he was not
  helping Matilda with the Vecchia ice cream and the <i>petits fours</i>. He
  was deeply disquieted. Eight years ago, when Verona had given a high-school
  party, the children had been featureless gabies. Now they were men and women
  of the world, very supercilious men and women; the boys condescended to
  Babbitt, they wore evening-clothes, and with hauteur they accepted cigarettes
  from silver cases. Babbitt had heard stories of what the Athletic Club called
  "goings on" at young parties; of girls "parking" their corsets in the
  dressing-room, of "cuddling" and "petting," and a presumable increase in what
  was known as Immorality. To-night he believed the stories. These children
  seemed bold to him, and cold. The girls wore misty chiffon, coral velvet, or
  cloth of gold, and around their dipping bobbed hair were shining wreaths. He
  had it, upon urgent and secret inquiry, that no corsets were known to be
  parked upstairs; but certainly these eager bodies were not stiff with steel.
  Their stockings were of lustrous silk, their slippers costly and unnatural,
  their lips carmined and their eyebrows penciled. They danced cheek to cheek
  with the boys, and Babbitt sickened with apprehension and unconscious
  envy.</p>

  <p>Worst of them all was Eunice Littlefield, and maddest of all the boys was
  Ted. Eunice was a flying demon. She slid the length of the room; her tender
  shoulders swayed; her feet were deft as a weaver's shuttle; she laughed, and
  enticed Babbitt to dance with her.</p>

  <p>Then he discovered the annex to the party.</p>

  <p>The boys and girls disappeared occasionally, and he remembered rumors of
  their drinking together from hip-pocket flasks. He tiptoed round the house,
  and in each of the dozen cars waiting in the street he saw the points of
  light from cigarettes, from each of them heard high giggles. He wanted to
  denounce them but (standing in the snow, peering round the dark corner) he
  did not dare. He tried to be tactful. When he had returned to the front hall
  he coaxed the boys, "Say, if any of you fellows are thirsty, there's some
  dandy ginger ale."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Thanks!" they condescended.</p>

  <p>He sought his wife, in the pantry, and exploded, "I'd like to go in there
  and throw some of those young pups out of the house! They talk down to me
  like I was the butler! I'd like to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know," she sighed; "only everybody says, all the mothers tell me,
  unless you stand for them, if you get angry because they go out to their cars
  to have a drink, they won't come to your house any more, and we wouldn't want
  Ted left out of things, would we?"</p>

  <p>He announced that he would be enchanted to have Ted left out of things,
  and hurried in to be polite, lest Ted be left out of things.</p>

  <p>But, he resolved, if he found that the boys were drinking, he
  would&mdash;well, he'd "hand 'em something that would surprise 'em." While he
  was trying to be agreeable to large-shouldered young bullies he was earnestly
  sniffing at them Twice he caught the reek of prohibition-time whisky, but
  then, it was only twice&mdash;</p>

  <p>Dr. Howard Littlefield lumbered in.</p>

  <p>He had come, in a mood of solemn parental patronage, to look on. Ted and
  Eunice were dancing, moving together like one body. Littlefield gasped. He
  called Eunice. There was a whispered duologue, and Littlefield explained to
  Babbitt that Eunice's mother had a headache and needed her. She went off in
  tears. Babbitt looked after them furiously. "That little devil! Getting Ted
  into trouble! And Littlefield, the conceited old gas-bag, acting like it was
  Ted that was the bad influence!"</p>

  <p>Later he smelled whisky on Ted's breath.</p>

  <p>After the civil farewell to the guests, the row was terrific, a thorough
  Family Scene, like an avalanche, devastating and without reticences. Babbitt
  thundered, Mrs. Babbitt wept, Ted was unconvincingly defiant, and Verona in
  confusion as to whose side she was taking.</p>

  <p>For several months there was coolness between the Babbitts and the
  Littlefields, each family sheltering their lamb from the wolf-cub next door.
  Babbitt and Littlefield still spoke in pontifical periods about motors and
  the senate, but they kept bleakly away from mention of their families.
  Whenever Eunice came to the house she discussed with pleasant intimacy the
  fact that she had been forbidden to come to the house; and Babbitt tried,
  with no success whatever, to be fatherly and advisory with her.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">"Gosh all fishhooks!" Ted wailed to Eunice, as they wolfed
  hot chocolate, lumps of nougat, and an assortment of glace nuts, in the
  mosaic splendor of the Royal Drug Store, "it gets me why Dad doesn't just
  pass out from being so poky. Every evening he sits there, about half-asleep,
  and if Rone or I say, 'Oh, come on, let's do something,' he doesn't even take
  the trouble to think about it. He just yawns and says, 'Naw, this suits me
  right here.' He doesn't know there's any fun going on anywhere. I suppose he
  must do some thinking, same as you and I do, but gosh, there's no way of
  telling it. I don't believe that outside of the office and playing a little
  bum golf on Saturday he knows there's anything in the world to do except just
  keep sitting there-sitting there every night&mdash;not wanting to go
  anywhere&mdash;not wanting to do anything&mdash;thinking us kids are
  crazy&mdash;sitting there&mdash;Lord!"</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">If he was frightened by Ted's slackness, Babbitt was not
  sufficiently frightened by Verona. She was too safe. She lived too much in
  the neat little airless room of her mind. Kenneth Escott and she were always
  under foot. When they were not at home, conducting their cautiously radical
  courtship over sheets of statistics, they were trudging off to lectures by
  authors and Hindu philosophers and Swedish lieutenants.</p>

  <p>"Gosh," Babbitt wailed to his wife, as they walked home from the Fogartys'
  bridge-party, "it gets me how Rone and that fellow can be so poky. They sit
  there night after night, whenever he isn't working, and they don't know
  there's any fun in the world. All talk and discussion&mdash;Lord! Sitting
  there&mdash;sitting there&mdash;night after night&mdash;not wanting to do
  anything&mdash;thinking I'm crazy because I like to go out and play a fist of
  cards&mdash;sitting there&mdash;gosh!"</p>

  <p>Then round the swimmer, bored by struggling through the perpetual surf of
  family life, new combers swelled.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">Babbitt's father- and mother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Henry T.
  Thompson, rented their old house in the Bellevue district and moved to the
  Hotel Hatton, that glorified boarding-house filled with widows, red-plush
  furniture, and the sound of ice-water pitchers. They were lonely there, and
  every other Sunday evening the Babbitts had to dine with them, on fricasseed
  chicken, discouraged celery, and cornstarch ice cream, and afterward sit,
  polite and restrained, in the hotel lounge, while a young woman violinist
  played songs from the German via Broadway.</p>

  <p>Then Babbitt's own mother came down from Catawba to spend three weeks.</p>

  <p>She was a kind woman and magnificently uncomprehending. She congratulated
  the convention-defying Verona on being a "nice, loyal home-body without all
  these Ideas that so many girls seem to have nowadays;" and when Ted filled
  the differential with grease, out of pure love of mechanics and filthiness,
  she rejoiced that he was "so handy around the house&mdash;and helping his
  father and all, and not going out with the girls all the time and trying to
  pretend he was a society fellow."</p>

  <p>Babbitt loved his mother, and sometimes he rather liked her, but he was
  annoyed by her Christian Patience, and he was reduced to pulpiness when she
  discoursed about a quite mythical hero called "Your Father":</p>

  <p>"You won't remember it, Georgie, you were such a little fellow at the
  time&mdash;my, I remember just how you looked that day, with your goldy brown
  curls and your lace collar, you always were such a dainty child, and kind of
  puny and sickly, and you loved pretty things so much and the red tassels on
  your little bootees and all&mdash;and Your Father was taking us to church and
  a man stopped us and said 'Major'&mdash;so many of the neighbors used to call
  Your Father 'Major;' of course he was only a private in The War but everybody
  knew that was because of the jealousy of his captain and he ought to have
  been a high-ranking officer, he had that natural ability to command that so
  very, very few men have&mdash;and this man came out into the road and held up
  his hand and stopped the buggy and said, 'Major,' he said, 'there's a lot of
  the folks around here that have decided to support Colonel Scanell for
  congress, and we want you to join us. Meeting people the way you do in the
  store, you could help us a lot.'</p>

  <p>"Well, Your Father just looked at him and said, 'I certainly shall do
  nothing of the sort. I don't like his politics,' he said. Well, the
  man&mdash;Captain Smith they used to call him, and heaven only knows why,
  because he hadn't the shadow or vestige of a right to be called 'Captain' or
  any other title&mdash;this Captain Smith said, 'We'll make it hot for you if
  you don't stick by your friends, Major.' Well, you know how Your Father was,
  and this Smith knew it too; he knew what a Real Man he was, and he knew Your
  Father knew the political situation from A to Z, and he ought to have seen
  that here was one man he couldn't impose on, but he went on trying to and
  hinting and trying till Your Father spoke up and said to him, 'Captain
  Smith,' he said, 'I have a reputation around these parts for being one who is
  amply qualified to mind his own business and let other folks mind theirs!'
  and with that he drove on and left the fellow standing there in the road like
  a bump on a log!"</p>

  <p>Babbitt was most exasperated when she revealed his boyhood to the
  children. He had, it seemed, been fond of barley-sugar; had worn the
  "loveliest little pink bow in his curls" and corrupted his own name to
  "Goo-goo." He heard (though he did not officially hear) Ted admonishing
  Tinka, "Come on now, kid; stick the lovely pink bow in your curls and beat it
  down to breakfast, or Goo-goo will jaw your head off."</p>

  <p>Babbitt's half-brother, Martin, with his wife and youngest baby, came down
  from Catawba for two days. Martin bred cattle and ran the dusty
  general-store. He was proud of being a freeborn independent American of the
  good old Yankee stock; he was proud of being honest, blunt, ugly, and
  disagreeable. His favorite remark was "How much did you pay for that?" He
  regarded Verona's books, Babbitt's silver pencil, and flowers on the table as
  citified extravagances, and said so. Babbitt would have quarreled with him
  but for his gawky wife and the baby, whom Babbitt teased and poked fingers at
  and addressed:</p>

  <p>"I think this baby's a bum, yes, sir, I think this little baby's a bum,
  he's a bum, yes, sir, he's a bum, that's what he is, he's a bum, this baby's
  a bum, he's nothing but an old bum, that's what he is&mdash;a bum!"</p>

  <p>All the while Verona and Kenneth Escott held long inquiries into
  epistemology; Ted was a disgraced rebel; and Tinka, aged eleven, was
  demanding that she be allowed to go to the movies thrice a week, "like all
  the girls."</p>

  <p>Babbitt raged, "I'm sick of it! Having to carry three generations. Whole
  damn bunch lean on me. Pay half of mother's income, listen to Henry T.,
  listen to Myra's worrying, be polite to Mart, and get called an old grouch
  for trying to help the children. All of 'em depending on me and picking on me
  and not a damn one of 'em grateful! No relief, and no credit, and no help
  from anybody. And to keep it up for&mdash;good Lord, how long?"</p>

  <p>He enjoyed being sick in February; he was delighted by their consternation
  that he, the rock, should give way.</p>

  <p>He had eaten a questionable clam. For two days he was languorous and
  petted and esteemed. He was allowed to snarl "Oh, let me alone!" without
  reprisals. He lay on the sleeping-porch and watched the winter sun slide
  along the taut curtains, turning their ruddy khaki to pale blood red. The
  shadow of the draw-rope was dense black, in an enticing ripple on the canvas.
  He found pleasure in the curve of it, sighed as the fading light blurred it.
  He was conscious of life, and a little sad. With no Vergil Gunches before
  whom to set his face in resolute optimism, he beheld, and half admitted that
  he beheld, his way of life as incredibly mechanical. Mechanical
  business&mdash;a brisk selling of badly built houses. Mechanical
  religion&mdash;a dry, hard church, shut off from the real life of the
  streets, inhumanly respectable as a top-hat. Mechanical golf and
  dinner-parties and bridge and conversation. Save with Paul Riesling,
  mechanical friendships&mdash;back-slapping and jocular, never daring to essay
  the test of quietness.</p>

  <p>He turned uneasily in bed.</p>

  <p>He saw the years, the brilliant winter days and all the long sweet
  afternoons which were meant for summery meadows, lost in such brittle
  pretentiousness. He thought of telephoning about leases, of cajoling men he
  hated, of making business calls and waiting in dirty anterooms&mdash;hat on
  knee, yawning at fly-specked calendars, being polite to office-boys.</p>

  <p>"I don't hardly want to go back to work," he prayed. "I'd like to&mdash;I
  don't know."</p>

  <p>But he was back next day, busy and of doubtful temper.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">The Zenith Street Traction Company planned to build
  car-repair shops in the suburb of Dorchester, but when they came to buy the
  land they found it held, on options, by the Babbitt-Thompson Realty Company.
  The purchasing-agent, the first vice-president, and even the president of the
  Traction Company protested against the Babbitt price. They mentioned their
  duty toward stockholders, they threatened an appeal to the courts, though
  somehow the appeal to the courts was never carried out and the officials
  found it wiser to compromise with Babbitt. Carbon copies of the
  correspondence are in the company's files, where they may be viewed by any
  public commission.</p>

  <p>Just after this Babbitt deposited three thousand dollars in the bank, the
  purchasing-agent of the Street Traction Company bought a five thousand dollar
  car, he first vice-president built a home in Devon Woods, and the president
  was appointed minister to a foreign country.</p>

  <p>To obtain the options, to tie up one man's land without letting his
  neighbor know, had been an unusual strain on Babbitt. It was necessary to
  introduce rumors about planning garages and stores, to pretend that he wasn't
  taking any more options, to wait and look as bored as a poker-player at a
  time when the failure to secure a key-lot threatened his whole plan. To all
  this was added a nerve-jabbing quarrel with his secret associates in the
  deal. They did not wish Babbitt and Thompson to have any share in the deal
  except as brokers. Babbitt rather agreed. "Ethics of the business-broker
  ought to strictly represent his principles and not get in on the buying," he
  said to Thompson.</p>

  <p>"Ethics, rats! Think I'm going to see that bunch of holy grafters get away
  with the swag and us not climb in?" snorted old Henry.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't like to do it. Kind of double-crossing."</p>

  <p>"It ain't. It's triple-crossing. It's the public that gets double-crossed.
  Well, now we've been ethical and got it out of our systems, the question is
  where we can raise a loan to handle some of the property for ourselves, on
  the Q. T. We can't go to our bank for it. Might come out."</p>

  <p>"I could see old Eathorne. He's close as the tomb."</p>

  <p>"That's the stuff."</p>

  <p>Eathorne was glad, he said, to "invest in character," to make Babbitt the
  loan and see to it that the loan did not appear on the books of the bank.
  Thus certain of the options which Babbitt and Thompson obtained were on
  parcels of real estate which they themselves owned, though the property did
  not appear in their names.</p>

  <p>In the midst of closing this splendid deal, which stimulated business and
  public confidence by giving an example of increased real-estate activity,
  Babbitt was overwhelmed to find that he had a dishonest person working for
  him.</p>

  <p>The dishonest one was Stanley Graff, the outside salesman.</p>

  <p>For some time Babbitt had been worried about Graff. He did not keep his
  word to tenants. In order to rent a house he would promise repairs which the
  owner had not authorized. It was suspected that he juggled inventories of
  furnished houses so that when the tenant left he had to pay for articles
  which had never been in the house and the price of which Graff put into his
  pocket. Babbitt had not been able to prove these suspicions, and though he
  had rather planned to discharge Graff he had never quite found time for
  it.</p>

  <p>Now into Babbitt's private room charged a red-faced man, panting, "Look
  here! I've come to raise particular merry hell, and unless you have that
  fellow pinched, I will!" "What's&mdash;Calm down, o' man. What's
  trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Trouble! Huh! Here's the trouble&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sit down and take it easy! They can hear you all over the building!"</p>

  <p>"This fellow Graff you got working for you, he leases me a house. I was in
  yesterday and signs the lease, all O.K., and he was to get the owner's
  signature and mail me the lease last night. Well, and he did. This morning I
  comes down to breakfast and the girl says a fellow had come to the house
  right after the early delivery and told her he wanted an envelope that had
  been mailed by mistake, big long envelope with 'Babbitt-Thompson' in the
  corner of it. Sure enough, there it was, so she lets him have it. And she
  describes the fellow to me, and it was this Graff. So I 'phones to him and
  he, the poor fool, he admits it! He says after my lease was all signed he got
  a better offer from another fellow and he wanted my lease back. Now what you
  going to do about it?"</p>

  <p>"Your name is&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"William Varney&mdash;W. K. Varney."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. That was the Garrison house." Babbitt sounded the buzzer. When
  Miss McGoun came in, he demanded, "Graff gone out?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Will you look through his desk and see if there is a lease made out to
  Mr. Varney on the Garrison house?" To Varney: "Can't tell you how sorry I am
  this happened. Needless to say, I'll fire Graff the minute he comes in. And
  of course your lease stands. But there's one other thing I'd like to do. I'll
  tell the owner not to pay us the commission but apply it to your rent. No!
  Straight! I want to. To be frank, this thing shakes me up bad. I suppose I've
  always been a Practical Business Man. Probably I've told one or two fairy
  stories in my time, when the occasion called for it&mdash;you know: sometimes
  you have to lay things on thick, to impress boneheads. But this is the first
  time I've ever had to accuse one of my own employees of anything more
  dishonest than pinching a few stamps. Honest, it would hurt me if we profited
  by it. So you'll let me hand you the commission? Good!"</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">He walked through the February city, where trucks flung up a
  spattering of slush and the sky was dark above dark brick cornices. He came
  back miserable. He, who respected the law, had broken it by concealing the
  Federal crime of interception of the mails. But he could not see Graff go to
  jail and his wife suffer. Worse, he had to discharge Graff and this was a
  part of office routine which he feared. He liked people so much, he so much
  wanted them to like him that he could not bear insulting them.</p>

  <p>Miss McGoun dashed in to whisper, with the excitement of an approaching
  scene, "He's here!"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Graff? Ask him to come in."</p>

  <p>He tried to make himself heavy and calm in his chair, and to keep his eyes
  expressionless. Graff stalked in&mdash;a man of thirty-five, dapper,
  eye-glassed, with a foppish mustache.</p>

  <p>"Want me?" said Graff.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Sit down."</p>

  <p>Graff continued to stand, grunting, "I suppose that old nut Varney has
  been in to see you. Let me explain about him. He's a regular tightwad, and he
  sticks out for every cent, and he practically lied to me about his ability to
  pay the rent&mdash;I found that out just after we signed up. And then another
  fellow comes along with a better offer for the house, and I felt it was my
  duty to the firm to get rid of Varney, and I was so worried about it I skun
  up there and got back the lease. Honest, Mr. Babbitt, I didn't intend to pull
  anything crooked. I just wanted the firm to have all the commis&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait now, Stan. This may all be true, but I've been having a lot of
  complaints about you. Now I don't s'pose you ever mean to do wrong, and I
  think if you just get a good lesson that'll jog you up a little, you'll turn
  out a first-class realtor yet. But I don't see how I can keep you on."</p>

  <p>Graff leaned against the filing-cabinet, his hands in his pockets, and
  laughed. "So I'm fired! Well, old Vision and Ethics, I'm tickled to death!
  But I don't want you to think you can get away with any holier-than-thou
  stuff. Sure I've pulled some raw stuff&mdash;a little of it&mdash;but how
  could I help it, in this office?"</p>

  <p>"Now, by God, young man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut! Keep the naughty temper down, and don't holler, because
  everybody in the outside office will hear you. They're probably listening
  right now. Babbitt, old dear, you're crooked in the first place and a damn
  skinflint in the second. If you paid me a decent salary I wouldn't have to
  steal pennies off a blind man to keep my wife from starving. Us married just
  five months, and her the nicest girl living, and you keeping us flat broke
  all the time, you damned old thief, so you can put money away for your
  saphead of a son and your wishywashy fool of a daughter! Wait, now! You'll by
  God take it, or I'll bellow so the whole office will hear it! And
  crooked&mdash;Say, if I told the prosecuting attorney what I know about this
  last Street Traction option steal, both you and me would go to jail, along
  with some nice, clean, pious, high-up traction guns!"</p>

  <p>"Well, Stan, looks like we were coming down to cases. That
  deal&mdash;There was nothing crooked about it. The only way you can get
  progress is for the broad-gauged men to get things done; and they got to be
  rewarded&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for Pete's sake, don't get virtuous on me! As I gather it, I'm fired.
  All right. It's a good thing for me. And if I catch you knocking me to any
  other firm, I'll squeal all I know about you and Henry T. and the dirty
  little lickspittle deals that you corporals of industry pull off for the
  bigger and brainier crooks, and you'll get chased out of town. And
  me&mdash;you're right, Babbitt, I've been going crooked, but now I'm going
  straight, and the first step will be to get a job in some office where the
  boss doesn't talk about Ideals. Bad luck, old dear, and you can stick your
  job up the sewer!"</p>

  <p>Babbitt sat for a long time, alternately raging, "I'll have him arrested,"
  and yearning "I wonder&mdash;No, I've never done anything that wasn't
  necessary to keep the Wheels of Progress moving."</p>

  <p>Next day he hired in Graff's place Fritz Weilinger, the salesman of his
  most injurious rival, the East Side Homes and Development Company, and thus
  at once annoyed his competitor and acquired an excellent man. Young Fritz was
  a curly-headed, merry, tennis-playing youngster. He made customers welcome to
  the office. Babbitt thought of him as a son, and in him had much comfort.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">An abandoned race-track on the outskirts of Chicago, a plot
  excellent for factory sites, was to be sold, and Jake Offut asked Babbitt to
  bid on it for him. The strain of the Street Traction deal and his
  disappointment in Stanley Graff had so shaken Babbitt that he found it hard
  to sit at his desk and concentrate. He proposed to his family, "Look here,
  folks! Do you know who's going to trot up to Chicago for a couple of
  days&mdash;just week-end; won't lose but one day of school&mdash;know who's
  going with that celebrated business-ambassador, George F. Babbitt? Why, Mr.
  Theodore Roosevelt Babbitt!"</p>

  <p>"Hurray!" Ted shouted, and "Oh, maybe the Babbitt men won't paint that lil
  ole town red!"</p>

  <p>And, once away from the familiar implications of home, they were two men
  together. Ted was young only in his assumption of oldness, and the only
  realms, apparently, in which Babbitt had a larger and more grown-up knowledge
  than Ted's were the details of real estate and the phrases of politics. When
  the other sages of the Pullman smoking-compartment had left them to
  themselves, Babbitt's voice did not drop into the playful and otherwise
  offensive tone in which one addresses children but continued its overwhelming
  and monotonous rumble, and Ted tried to imitate it in his strident tenor:</p>

  <p>"Gee, dad, you certainly did show up that poor boot when he got flip about
  the League of Nations!"</p>

  <p>"Well, the trouble with a lot of these fellows is, they simply don't know
  what they're talking about. They don't get down to facts...What do you think
  of Ken Escott?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you, dad: it strikes me Ken is a nice lad; no special faults
  except he smokes too much; but slow, Lord! Why, if we don't give him a shove
  the poor dumb-bell never will propose! And Rone just as bad. Slow."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I guess you're right. They're slow. They haven't either one of 'em
  got our pep."</p>

  <p>"That's right. They're slow. I swear, dad, I don't know how Rone got into
  our family! I'll bet, if the truth were known, you were a bad old egg when
  you were a kid!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I wasn't so slow!"</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you weren't! I'll bet you didn't miss many tricks!"</p>

  <p>"Well, when I was out with the girls I didn't spend all the time telling
  'em about the strike in the knitting industry!"</p>

  <p>They roared together, and together lighted cigars.</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do with 'em?" Babbitt consulted.</p>

  <p>"Gosh, I don't know. I swear, sometimes I feel like taking Ken aside and
  putting him over the jumps and saying to him, 'Young fella me lad, are you
  going to marry young Rone, or are you going to talk her to death? Here you
  are getting on toward thirty, and you're only making twenty or twenty-five a
  week. When you going to develop a sense of responsibility and get a raise? If
  there's anything that George F. or I can do to help you, call on us, but show
  a little speed, anyway!'"</p>

  <p>"Well, at that, it might not be so bad if you or I talked to him, except
  he might not understand. He's one of these high brows. He can't come down to
  cases and lay his cards on the table and talk straight out from the shoulder,
  like you or I can."</p>

  <p>"That's right, he's like all these highbrows."</p>

  <p>"That's so, like all of 'em."</p>

  <p>"That's a fact."</p>

  <p>They sighed, and were silent and thoughtful and happy.</p>

  <p>The conductor came in. He had once called at Babbitt's office, to ask
  about houses. "H' are you, Mr. Babbitt! We going to have you with us to
  Chicago? This your boy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, this is my son Ted."</p>

  <p>"Well now, what do you know about that! Here I been thinking you were a
  youngster yourself, not a day over forty, hardly, and you with this great big
  fellow!"</p>

  <p>"Forty? Why, brother, I'll never see forty-five again!"</p>

  <p>"Is that a fact! Wouldn't hardly 'a' thought it!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, it's a bad give-away for the old man when he has to travel with
  a young whale like Ted here!"</p>

  <p>"You're right, it is." To Ted: "I suppose you're in college now?"</p>

  <p>Proudly, "No, not till next fall. I'm just kind of giving the diff'rent
  colleges the once-over now."</p>

  <p>As the conductor went on his affable way, huge watch-chain jingling
  against his blue chest, Babbitt and Ted gravely considered colleges. They
  arrived at Chicago late at night; they lay abed in the morning, rejoicing,
  "Pretty nice not to have to get up and get down to breakfast, heh?" They were
  staying at the modest Eden Hotel, because Zenith business men always stayed
  at the Eden, but they had dinner in the brocade and crystal Versailles Room
  of the Regency Hotel. Babbitt ordered Blue Point oysters with cocktail sauce,
  a tremendous steak with a tremendous platter of French fried potatoes, two
  pots of coffee, apple pie with ice cream for both of them and, for Ted, an
  extra piece of mince pie.</p>

  <p>"Hot stuff! Some feed, young fella!" Ted admired.</p>

  <p>"Huh! You stick around with me, old man, and I'll show you a good
  time!"</p>

  <p>They went to a musical comedy and nudged each other at the matrimonial
  jokes and the prohibition jokes; they paraded the lobby, arm in arm, between
  acts, and in the glee of his first release from the shame which dissevers
  fathers and sons Ted chuckled, "Dad, did you ever hear the one about the
  three milliners and the judge?"</p>

  <p>When Ted had returned to Zenith, Babbitt was lonely. As he was trying to
  make alliance between Offutt and certain Milwaukee interests which wanted the
  race-track plot, most of his time was taken up in waiting for telephone
  calls...Sitting on the edge of his bed, holding the portable telephone,
  asking wearily, "Mr. Sagen not in yet? Didn' he leave any message for me? All
  right, I'll hold the wire." Staring at a stain on the wall, reflecting that
  it resembled a shoe, and being bored by this twentieth discovery that it
  resembled a shoe. Lighting a cigarette; then, bound to the telephone with no
  ashtray in reach, wondering what to do with this burning menace and anxiously
  trying to toss it into the tiled bathroom. At last, on the telephone, "No
  message, eh? All right, I'll call up again."</p>

  <p>One afternoon he wandered through snow-rutted streets of which he had
  never heard, streets of small tenements and two-family houses and marooned
  cottages. It came to him that he had nothing to do, that there was nothing he
  wanted to do. He was bleakly lonely in the evening, when he dined by himself
  at the Regency Hotel. He sat in the lobby afterward, in a plush chair
  bedecked with the Saxe-Coburg arms, lighting a cigar and looking for some one
  who would come and play with him and save him from thinking. In the chair
  next to him (showing the arms of Lithuania) was a half-familiar man, a large
  red-faced man with pop eyes and a deficient yellow mustache. He seemed kind
  and insignificant, and as lonely as Babbitt himself. He wore a tweed suit and
  a reluctant orange tie.</p>

  <p>It came to Babbitt with a pyrotechnic crash. The melancholy stranger was
  Sir Gerald Doak.</p>

  <p>Instinctively Babbitt rose, bumbling, "How 're you, Sir Gerald? 'Member we
  met in Zenith, at Charley McKelvey's? Babbitt's my name&mdash;real
  estate."</p>

  <p>"Oh! How d' you do." Sir Gerald shook hands flabbily.</p>

  <p>Embarrassed, standing, wondering how he could retreat, Babbitt maundered,
  "Well, I suppose you been having a great trip since we saw you in
  Zenith."</p>

  <p>"Quite. British Columbia and California and all over the place," he said
  doubtfully, looking at Babbitt lifelessly.</p>

  <p>"How did you find business conditions in British Columbia? Or I suppose
  maybe you didn't look into 'em. Scenery and sport and so on?"</p>

  <p>"Scenery? Oh, capital. But business conditions&mdash;You know, Mr.
  Babbitt, they're having almost as much unemployment as we are." Sir Gerald
  was speaking warmly now.</p>

  <p>"So? Business conditions not so doggone good, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No, business conditions weren't at all what I'd hoped to find them."</p>

  <p>"Not good, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No, not&mdash;not really good."</p>

  <p>"That's a darn shame. Well&mdash;I suppose you're waiting for somebody to
  take you out to some big shindig, Sir Gerald."</p>

  <p>"Shindig? Oh. Shindig. No, to tell you the truth, I was wondering what the
  deuce I could do this evening. Don't know a soul in Tchicahgo. I wonder if
  you happen to know whether there's a good theater in this city?"</p>

  <p>"Good? Why say, they're running grand opera right now! I guess maybe you'd
  like that."</p>

  <p>"Eh? Eh? Went to the opera once in London. Covent Garden sort of thing.
  Shocking! No, I was wondering if there was a good cinema-movie."</p>

  <p>Babbitt was sitting down, hitching his chair over, shouting, "Movie? Say,
  Sir Gerald, I supposed of course you had a raft of dames waiting to lead you
  out to some soiree&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"God forbid!"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;but if you haven't, what do you say you and me go to a movie?
  There's a peach of a film at the Grantham: Bill Hart in a bandit
  picture."</p>

  <p>"Right-o! Just a moment while I get my coat."</p>

  <p>Swollen with greatness, slightly afraid lest the noble blood of Nottingham
  change its mind and leave him at any street corner, Babbitt paraded with Sir
  Gerald Doak to the movie palace and in silent bliss sat beside him, trying
  not to be too enthusiastic, lest the knight despise his adoration of
  six-shooters and broncos. At the end Sir Gerald murmured, "Jolly good
  picture, this. So awfully decent of you to take me. Haven't enjoyed myself so
  much for weeks. All these Hostesses&mdash;they never let you go to the
  cinema!"</p>

  <p>"The devil you say!" Babbitt's speech had lost the delicate refinement and
  all the broad A's with which he had adorned it, and become hearty and
  natural. "Well, I'm tickled to death you liked it, Sir Gerald."</p>

  <p>They crawled past the knees of fat women into the aisle; they stood in the
  lobby waving their arms in the rite of putting on overcoats. Babbitt hinted,
  "Say, how about a little something to eat? I know a place where we could get
  a swell rarebit, and we might dig up a little drink&mdash;that is, if you
  ever touch the stuff."</p>

  <p>"Rather! But why don't you come to my room? I've some Scotch&mdash;not
  half bad."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't want to use up all your hootch. It's darn nice of you,
  but&mdash;You probably want to hit the hay."</p>

  <p>Sir Gerald was transformed. He was beefily yearning. "Oh really, now; I
  haven't had a decent evening for so long! Having to go to all these dances.
  No chance to discuss business and that sort of thing. Do be a good chap and
  come along. Won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Will I? You bet! I just thought maybe&mdash;Say, by golly, it does do a
  fellow good, don't it, to sit and visit about business conditions, after he's
  been to these balls and masquerades and banquets and all that society stuff.
  I often feel that way in Zenith. Sure, you bet I'll come."</p>

  <p>"That's awfully nice of you." They beamed along the street. "Look here,
  old chap, can you tell me, do American cities always keep up this dreadful
  social pace? All these magnificent parties?"</p>

  <p>"Go on now, quit your kidding! Gosh, you with court balls and functions
  and everything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, really, old chap! Mother and I&mdash;Lady Doak, I should say, we
  usually play a hand of bezique and go to bed at ten. Bless my soul, I
  couldn't keep up your beastly pace! And talking! All your American women,
  they know so much&mdash;culture and that sort of thing. This Mrs.
  McKelvey&mdash;your friend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yuh, old Lucile. Good kid."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;she asked me which of the galleries I liked best in Florence. Or
  was it in Firenze? Never been in Italy in my life! And primitives. Did I like
  primitives. Do you know what the deuce a primitive is?"</p>

  <p>"Me? I should say not! But I know what a discount for cash is."</p>

  <p>"Rather! So do I, by George! But primitives!"</p>

  <p>"Yuh! Primitives!"</p>

  <p>They laughed with the sound of a Boosters' luncheon.</p>

  <p>Sir Gerald's room was, except for his ponderous and durable English bags,
  very much like the room of George F. Babbitt; and quite in the manner of
  Babbitt he disclosed a huge whisky flask, looked proud and hospitable, and
  chuckled, "Say, when, old chap."</p>

  <p>It was after the third drink that Sir Gerald proclaimed, "How do you
  Yankees get the notion that writing chaps like Bertrand Shaw and this Wells
  represent us? The real business England, we think those chaps are traitors.
  Both our countries have their comic Old Aristocracy&mdash;you know, old
  county families, hunting people and all that sort of thing&mdash;and we both
  have our wretched labor leaders, but we both have a backbone of sound
  business men who run the whole show."</p>

  <p>"You bet. Here's to the real guys!"</p>

  <p>"I'm with you! Here's to ourselves!"</p>

  <p>It was after the fourth drink that Sir Gerald asked humbly, "What do you
  think of North Dakota mortgages?" but it was not till after the fifth that
  Babbitt began to call him "Jerry," and Sir Gerald confided, "I say, do you
  mind if I pull off my boots?" and ecstatically stretched his knightly feet,
  his poor, tired, hot, swollen feet out on the bed.</p>

  <p>After the sixth, Babbitt irregularly arose. "Well, I better be hiking
  along. Jerry, you're a regular human being! I wish to thunder we'd been
  better acquainted in Zenith. Lookit. Can't you come back and stay with me a
  while?"</p>

  <p>"So sorry&mdash;must go to New York to-morrow. Most awfully sorry, old
  boy. I haven't enjoyed an evening so much since I've been in the States. Real
  talk. Not all this social rot. I'd never have let them give me the beastly
  title&mdash;and I didn't get it for nothing, eh?&mdash;if I'd thought I'd
  have to talk to women about primitives and polo! Goodish thing to have in
  Nottingham, though; annoyed the mayor most frightfully when I got it; and of
  course the missus likes it. But nobody calls me 'Jerry' now&mdash;" He was
  almost weeping. "&mdash;and nobody in the States has treated me like a friend
  till to-night! Good-by, old chap, good-by! Thanks awfully!"</p>

  <p>"Don't mention it, Jerry. And remember whenever you get to Zenith, the
  latch-string is always out."</p>

  <p>"And don't forget, old boy, if you ever come to Nottingham, Mother and I
  will be frightfully glad to see you. I shall tell the fellows in Nottingham
  your ideas about Visions and Real Guys&mdash;at our next Rotary Club
  luncheon."</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">Babbitt lay abed at his hotel, imagining the Zenith Athletic
  Club asking him, "What kind of a time d'you have in Chicago?" and his
  answering, "Oh, fair; ran around with Sir Gerald Doak a lot;" picturing
  himself meeting Lucile McKelvey and admonishing her, "You're all right, Mrs.
  Mac, when you aren't trying to pull this highbrow pose. It's just as Gerald
  Doak says to me in Chicago&mdash;oh, yes, Jerry's an old friend of
  mine&mdash;the wife and I are thinking of running over to England to stay
  with Jerry in his castle, next year&mdash;and he said to me, 'Georgie, old
  bean, I like Lucile first-rate, but you and me, George, we got to make her
  get over this highty-tighty hooptediddle way she's got."</p>

  <p>But that evening a thing happened which wrecked his pride.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">At the Regency Hotel cigar-counter he fell to talking with a
  salesman of pianos, and they dined together. Babbitt was filled with
  friendliness and well-being. He enjoyed the gorgeousness of the dining-room:
  the chandeliers, the looped brocade curtains, the portraits of French kings
  against panels of gilded oak. He enjoyed the crowd: pretty women, good solid
  fellows who were "liberal spenders."</p>

  <p>He gasped. He stared, and turned away, and stared again. Three tables off,
  with a doubtful sort of woman, a woman at once coy and withered, was Paul
  Riesling, and Paul was supposed to be in Akron, selling tar-roofing. The
  woman was tapping his hand, mooning at him and giggling. Babbitt felt that he
  had encountered something involved and harmful. Paul was talking with the
  rapt eagerness of a man who is telling his troubles. He was concentrated on
  the woman's faded eyes. Once he held her hand and once, blind to the other
  guests, he puckered his lips as though he was pretending to kiss her. Babbitt
  had so strong an impulse to go to Paul that he could feel his body uncoiling,
  his shoulders moving, but he felt, desperately, that he must be diplomatic,
  and not till he saw Paul paying the check did he bluster to the
  piano-salesman, "By golly-friend of mine over there&mdash;'scuse me
  second&mdash;just say hello to him."</p>

  <p>He touched Paul's shoulder, and cried, "Well, when did you hit town?"</p>

  <p>Paul glared up at him, face hardening. "Oh, hello, George. Thought you'd
  gone back to Zenith." He did not introduce his companion. Babbitt peeped at
  her. She was a flabbily pretty, weakly flirtatious woman of forty-two or
  three, in an atrocious flowery hat. Her rouging was thorough but
  unskilful.</p>

  <p>"Where you staying, Paulibus?"</p>

  <p>The woman turned, yawned, examined her nails. She seemed accustomed to not
  being introduced.</p>

  <p>Paul grumbled, "Campbell Inn, on the South Side."</p>

  <p>"Alone?" It sounded insinuating.</p>

  <p>"Yes! Unfortunately!" Furiously Paul turned toward the woman, smiling with
  a fondness sickening to Babbitt. "May! Want to introduce you. Mrs. Arnold,
  this is my old-acquaintance, George Babbitt."</p>

  <p>"Pleasmeech," growled Babbitt, while she gurgled, "Oh, I'm very pleased to
  meet any friend of Mr. Riesling's, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>Babbitt demanded, "Be back there later this evening, Paul? I'll drop down
  and see you."</p>

  <p>"No, better&mdash;We better lunch together to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"All right, but I'll see you to-night, too, Paul. I'll go down to your
  hotel, and I'll wait for you!"</p>

     name="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">He sat smoking with the piano-salesman, clinging to the warm
  refuge of gossip, afraid to venture into thoughts of Paul. He was the more
  affable on the surface as secretly he became more apprehensive, felt more
  hollow. He was certain that Paul was in Chicago without Zilla's knowledge,
  and that he was doing things not at all moral and secure. When the salesman
  yawned that he had to write up his orders, Babbitt left him, left the hotel,
  in leisurely calm. But savagely he said "Campbell Inn!" to the taxi-driver.
  He sat agitated on the slippery leather seat, in that chill dimness which
  smelled of dust and perfume and Turkish cigarettes. He did not heed the snowy
  lake-front, the dark spaces and sudden bright corners in the unknown land
  south of the Loop.</p>

  <p>The office of the Campbell Inn was hard, bright, new; the night clerk
  harder and brighter. "Yep?" he said to Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Paul Riesling registered here?"</p>

  <p>"Yep."</p>

  <p>"Is he in now?"</p>

  <p>"Nope."</p>

  <p>"Then if you'll give me his key, I'll wait for him."</p>

  <p>"Can't do that, brother. Wait down here if you wanna."</p>

  <p>Babbitt had spoken with the deference which all the Clan of Good Fellows
  give to hotel clerks. Now he said with snarling abruptness:</p>

  <p>"I may have to wait some time. I'm Riesling's brother-in-law. I'll go up
  to his room. D' I look like a sneak-thief?"</p>

  <p>His voice was low and not pleasant. With considerable haste the clerk took
  down the key, protesting, "I never said you looked like a sneak-thief. Just
  rules of the hotel. But if you want to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>On his way up in the elevator Babbitt wondered why he was here. Why
  shouldn't Paul be dining with a respectable married woman? Why had he lied to
  the clerk about being Paul's brother-in-law? He had acted like a child. He
  must be careful not to say foolish dramatic things to Paul. As he settled
  down he tried to look pompous and placid. Then the thought&mdash;Suicide.
  He'd been dreading that, without knowing it. Paul would be just the person to
  do something like that. He must be out of his head or he wouldn't be
  confiding in that&mdash;that dried-up hag.</p>

  <p>Zilla (oh, damn Zilla! how gladly he'd throttle that nagging fiend of a
  woman!)&mdash;she'd probably succeeded at last, and driven Paul crazy.</p>

  <p>Suicide. Out there in the lake, way out, beyond the piled ice along the
  shore. It would be ghastly cold to drop into the water to-night.</p>

  <p>Or&mdash;throat cut&mdash;in the bathroom&mdash;</p>

  <p>Babbitt flung into Paul's bathroom. It was empty. He smiled, feebly.</p>

  <p>He pulled at his choking collar, looked at his watch, opened the window to
  stare down at the street, looked at his watch, tried to read the evening
  paper lying on the glass-topped bureau, looked again at his watch. Three
  minutes had gone by since he had first looked at it.</p>

  <p>And he waited for three hours.</p>

  <p>He was sitting fixed, chilled, when the doorknob turned. Paul came in
  glowering.</p>

  <p>"Hello," Paul said. "Been waiting?"</p>

  <p>"Yuh, little while."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Well what? Just thought I'd drop in to see how you made out in
  Akron."</p>

  <p>"I did all right. What difference does it make?"</p>

  <p>"Why, gosh, Paul, what are you sore about?"</p>

  <p>"What are you butting into my affairs for?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Paul, that's no way to talk! I'm not butting into nothing. I was so
  glad to see your ugly old phiz that I just dropped in to say howdy."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not going to have anybody following me around and trying to
  boss me. I've had all of that I'm going to stand!"</p>

  <p>"Well, gosh, I'm not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I didn't like the way you looked at May Arnold, or the snooty way you
  talked."</p>

  <p>"Well, all right then! If you think I'm a buttinsky, then I'll just butt
  in! I don't know who your May Arnold is, but I know doggone good and well
  that you and her weren't talking about tar-roofing, no, nor about playing the
  violin, neither! If you haven't got any moral consideration for yourself, you
  ought to have some for your position in the community. The idea of your going
  around places gawping into a female's eyes like a love-sick pup! I can
  understand a fellow slipping once, but I don't propose to see a fellow that's
  been as chummy with me as you have getting started on the downward path and
  sneaking off from his wife, even as cranky a one as Zilla, to go
  woman-chasing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're a perfectly moral little husband!"</p>

  <p>"I am, by God! I've never looked at any woman except Myra since I've been
  married&mdash;practically&mdash;and I never will! I tell you there's nothing
  to immorality. It don't pay. Can't you see, old man, it just makes Zilla
  still crankier?"</p>

  <p>Slight of resolution as he was of body, Paul threw his snow-beaded
  overcoat on the floor and crouched on a flimsy cane chair. "Oh, you're an old
  blowhard, and you know less about morality than Tinka, but you're all right,
  Georgie. But you can't understand that&mdash;I'm through. I can't go Zilla's
  hammering any longer. She's made up her mind that I'm a devil,
  and&mdash;Reg'lar Inquisition. Torture. She enjoys it. It's a game to see how
  sore she can make me. And me, either it's find a little comfort, any comfort,
  anywhere, or else do something a lot worse. Now this Mrs. Arnold, she's not
  so young, but she's a fine woman and she understands a fellow, and she's had
  her own troubles."</p>

  <p>"Yea! I suppose she's one of these hens whose husband 'doesn't understand
  her'!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Maybe. He was killed in the war."</p>

  <p>Babbitt lumbered up, stood beside Paul patting his shoulder, making soft
  apologetic noises.</p>

  <p>"Honest, George, she's a fine woman, and she's had one hell of a time. We
  manage to jolly each other up a lot. We tell each other we're the dandiest
  pair on earth. Maybe we don't believe it, but it helps a lot to have somebody
  with whom you can be perfectly simple, and not all this
  discussing&mdash;explaining&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And that's as far as you go?"</p>

  <p>"It is not! Go on! Say it!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't&mdash;I can't say I like it, but&mdash;" With a burst which
  left him feeling large and shining with generosity, "it's none of my darn
  business! I'll do anything I can for you, if there's anything I can do."</p>

  <p>"There might be. I judge from Zilla's letters that 've been forwarded from
  Akron that she's getting suspicious about my staying away so long. She'd be
  perfectly capable of having me shadowed, and of coming to Chicago and busting
  into a hotel dining-room and bawling me out before everybody."</p>

  <p>"I'll take care of Zilla. I'll hand her a good fairy-story when I get back
  to Zenith."</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;I don't think you better try it. You're a good fellow.
  but I don't know that diplomacy is your strong point." Babbitt looked hurt,
  then irritated. "I mean with women! With women, I mean. Course they got to go
  some to beat you in business diplomacy, but I just mean with women. Zilla may
  do a lot of rough talking, but she's pretty shrewd. She'd have the story out
  of you in no time."</p>

  <p>"Well, all right, but&mdash;" Babbitt was still pathetic at not being
  allowed to play Secret Agent. Paul soothed:</p>

  <p>"Course maybe you might tell her you'd been in Akron and seen me
  there."</p>

  <p>"Why, sure, you bet! Don't I have to go look at that candy-store property
  in Akron? Don't I? Ain't it a shame I have to stop off there when I'm so
  anxious to get home? Ain't it a regular shame? I'll say it is! I'll say it's
  a doggone shame!"</p>

  <p>"Fine. But for glory hallelujah's sake don't go putting any fancy fixings
  on the story. When men lie they always try to make it too artistic, and
  that's why women get suspicious. And&mdash;Let's have a drink, Georgie. I've
  got some gin and a little vermouth."</p>

  <p>The Paul who normally refused a second cocktail took a second now, and a
  third. He became red-eyed and thick-tongued. He was embarrassingly jocular
  and salacious.</p>

  <p>In the taxicab Babbitt incredulously found tears crowding into his
  eyes.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">He had not told Paul of his plan but he did stop at Akron,
  between trains, for the one purpose of sending to Zilla a postcard with "Had
  to come here for the day, ran into Paul." In Zenith he called on her. If for
  public appearances Zilla was over-coiffed, over-painted, and resolutely
  corseted, for private misery she wore a filthy blue dressing-gown and torn
  stockings thrust into streaky pink satin mules. Her face was sunken. She
  seemed to have but half as much hair as Babbitt remembered, and that half was
  stringy. She sat in a rocker amid a debris of candy-boxes and cheap
  magazines, and she sounded dolorous when she did not sound derisive. But
  Babbitt was exceedingly breezy:</p>

  <p>"Well, well, Zil, old dear, having a good loaf while hubby's away? That's
  the ideal I'll bet a hat Myra never got up till ten, while I was in Chicago.
  Say, could I borrow your thermos&mdash;just dropped in to see if I could
  borrow your thermos bottle. We're going to have a toboggan party&mdash;want
  to take some coffee mit. Oh, did you get my card from Akron, saying I'd run
  into Paul?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. What was he doing?"</p>

  <p>"How do you mean?" He unbuttoned his overcoat, sat tentatively on the arm
  of a chair.</p>

  <p>"You know how I mean!" She slapped the pages of a magazine with an
  irritable clatter. "I suppose he was trying to make love to some hotel
  waitress or manicure girl or somebody."</p>

  <p>"Hang it, you're always letting on that Paul goes round chasing skirts. He
  doesn't, in the first place, and if he did, it would prob'ly be because you
  keep hinting at him and dinging at him so much. I hadn't meant to, Zilla, but
  since Paul is away, in Akron&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He really is in Akron? I know he has some horrible woman that he writes
  to in Chicago."</p>

  <p>"Didn't I tell you I saw him in Akron? What 're you trying to do? Make me
  out a liar?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I just&mdash;I get so worried."</p>

  <p>"Now, there you are! That's what gets me! Here you love Paul, and yet you
  plague him and cuss him out as if you hated him. I simply can't understand
  why it is that the more some folks love people, the harder they try to make
  'em miserable."</p>

  <p>"You love Ted and Rone&mdash;I suppose&mdash;and yet you nag them."</p>

  <p>"Oh. Well. That. That's different. Besides, I don't nag 'em. Not what
  you'd call nagging. But zize saying: Now, here's Paul, the nicest, most
  sensitive critter on God's green earth. You ought to be ashamed of yourself
  the way you pan him. Why, you talk to him like a washerwoman. I'm surprised
  you can act so doggone common, Zilla!"</p>

  <p>She brooded over her linked fingers. "Oh, I know. I do go and get mean
  sometimes, and I'm sorry afterwards. But, oh, Georgie, Paul is so
  aggravating! Honestly, I've tried awfully hard, these last few years, to be
  nice to him, but just because I used to be spiteful&mdash;or I seemed so; I
  wasn't, really, but I used to speak up and say anything that came into my
  head&mdash;and so he made up his mind that everything was my fault.
  Everything can't always be my fault, can it? And now if I get to fussing, he
  just turns silent, oh, so dreadfully silent, and he won't look at me&mdash;he
  just ignores me. He simply isn't human! And he deliberately keeps it up till
  I bust out and say a lot of things I don't mean. So silent&mdash;Oh, you
  righteous men! How wicked you are! How rotten wicked!"</p>

  <p>They thrashed things over and over for half an hour. At the end, weeping
  drably, Zilla promised to restrain herself.</p>

  <p>Paul returned four days later, and the Babbitts and Rieslings went
  festively to the movies and had chop suey at a Chinese restaurant. As they
  walked to the restaurant through a street of tailor shops and barber shops,
  the two wives in front, chattering about cooks, Babbitt murmured to Paul,
  "Zil seems a lot nicer now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, she has been, except once or twice. But it's too late now. I
  just&mdash;I'm not going to discuss it, but I'm afraid of her. There's
  nothing left. I don't ever want to see her. Some day I'm going to break away
  from her. Somehow."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">The International Organization of Boosters' Clubs has be
  come a world-force for optimism, manly pleasantry, and good business.
  Chapters are to be found now in thirty countries. Nine hundred and twenty of
  the thousand chapters, however, are in the United States.</p>

  <p>None of these is more ardent than the Zenith Boosters' Club.</p>

  <p>The second March lunch of the Zenith Boosters was the most important of
  the year, as it was to be followed by the annual election of officers. There
  was agitation abroad. The lunch was held in the ballroom of the O'Hearn
  House. As each of the four hundred Boosters entered he took from a wall-board
  a huge celluloid button announcing his name, his nick name, and his business.
  There was a fine of ten cents for calling a Fellow Booster by anything but
  his nickname at a lunch, and as Babbitt jovially checked his hat the air was
  radiant with shouts of "Hello, Chet!" and "How're you, Shorty!" and "Top o'
  the mornin', Mac!"</p>

  <p>They sat at friendly tables for eight, choosing places by lot. Babbitt was
  with Albert Boos the merchant tailor, Hector Seybolt of the Little Sweetheart
  Condensed Milk Company, Emil Wengert the jeweler, Professor Pumphrey of the
  Riteway Business College, Dr. Walter Gorbutt, Roy Teegarten the photographer,
  and Ben Berkey the photo-engraver. One of the merits of the Boosters' Club
  was that only two persons from each department of business were permitted to
  join, so that you at once encountered the Ideals of other occupations, and
  realized the metaphysical oneness of all occupations&mdash;plumbing and
  portrait-painting, medicine and the manufacture of chewing-gum.</p>

  <p>Babbitt's table was particularly happy to-day, because Professor Pumphrey
  had just had a birthday, and was therefore open to teasing.</p>

  <p>"Let's pump Pump about how old he is!" said Emil Wengert.</p>

  <p>"No, let's paddle him with a dancing-pump!" said Ben Berkey.</p>

  <p>But it was Babbitt who had the applause, with "Don't talk about pumps to
  that guy! The only pump he knows is a bottle! Honest, they tell me he's
  starting a class in home-brewing at the ole college!"</p>

  <p>At each place was the Boosters' Club booklet, listing the members. Though
  the object of the club was good-fellowship, yet they never lost sight of the
  importance of doing a little more business. After each name was the member's
  occupation. There were scores of advertisements in the booklet, and on one
  page the admonition: "There's no rule that you have to trade with your Fellow
  Boosters, but get wise, boy&mdash;what's the use of letting all this good
  money get outside of our happy fambly?" And at each place, to-day, there was
  a present; a card printed in artistic red and black:</p><br>

  <p class="sign">SERVICE AND BOOSTERISM</p>

  <p class="quote">Service finds its finest opportunity and development only in
  its broadest and deepest application and the consideration of its perpetual
  action upon reaction. I believe the highest type of Service, like the most
  progressive tenets of ethics, senses unceasingly and is motived by active
  adherence and loyalty to that which is the essential principle of
  Boosterism&mdash;Good Citizenship in all its factors and aspects.</p>

  <p class="quote">DAD PETERSEN.</p>

  <p class="quote">Compliments of Dadbury Petersen Advertising Corp.</p>

  <p class="sign">"Ads, not Fads, at Dad's"</p>

  <p><br>
  The Boosters all read Mr. Peterson's aphorism and said they understood it
  perfectly.</p>

  <p>The meeting opened with the regular weekly "stunts." Retiring President
  Vergil Gunch was in the chair, his stiff hair like a hedge, his voice like a
  brazen gong of festival. Members who had brought guests introduced them
  publicly. "This tall red-headed piece of misinformation is the sporting
  editor of the <i>Press</i>," said Willis Ijams; and H. H. Hazen, the
  druggist, chanted, "Boys, when you're on a long motor tour and finally get to
  a romantic spot or scene and draw up and remark to the wife, 'This is
  certainly a romantic place,' it sends a glow right up and down your
  vertebrae. Well, my guest to-day is from such a place, Harper's Ferry,
  Virginia, in the beautiful Southland, with memories of good old General
  Robert E. Lee and of that brave soul, John Brown who, like every good
  Booster, goes marching on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There were two especially distinguished guests: the leading man of the
  "Bird of Paradise" company, playing this week at the Dodsworth Theater, and
  the mayor of Zenith, the Hon. Lucas Prout.</p>

  <p>Vergil Gunch thundered, "When we manage to grab this celebrated Thespian
  off his lovely aggregation of beautiful actresses&mdash;and I got to admit I
  butted right into his dressing-room and told him how the Boosters appreciated
  the high-class artistic performance he's giving us&mdash;and don't forget
  that the treasurer of the Dodsworth is a Booster and will appreciate our
  patronage&mdash;and when on top of that we yank Hizzonor out of his
  multifarious duties at City Hall, then I feel we've done ourselves proud, and
  Mr. Prout will now say a few words about the problems and duties&mdash;"</p>

  <p>By rising vote the Boosters decided which was the handsomest and which the
  ugliest guest, and to each of them was given a bunch of carnations, donated,
  President Gunch noted, by Brother Booster H. G. Yeager, the Jennifer Avenue
  florist.</p>

  <p>Each week, in rotation, four Boosters were privileged to obtain the
  pleasures of generosity and of publicity by donating goods or services to
  four fellow-members, chosen by lot. There was laughter, this week, when it
  was announced that one of the contributors was Barnabas Joy, the undertaker.
  Everybody whispered, "I can think of a coupla good guys to be buried if his
  donation is a free funeral!"</p>

  <p>Through all these diversions the Boosters were lunching on chicken
  croquettes, peas, fried potatoes, coffee, apple pie, and American cheese.
  Gunch did not lump the speeches. Presently he called on the visiting
  secretary of the Zenith Rotary Club, a rival organization. The secretary had
  the distinction of possessing State Motor Car License Number 5.</p>

  <p>The Rotary secretary laughingly admitted that wherever he drove in the
  state so low a number created a sensation, and "though it was pretty nice to
  have the honor, yet traffic cops remembered it only too darn well, and
  sometimes he didn't know but what he'd almost as soon have just plain B56,876
  or something like that. Only let any doggone Booster try to get Number 5 away
  from a live Rotarian next year, and watch the fur fly! And if they'd permit
  him, he'd wind up by calling for a cheer for the Boosters and Rotarians and
  the Kiwanis all together!"</p>

  <p>Babbitt sighed to Professor Pumphrey, "Be pretty nice to have as low a
  number as that! Everybody 'd say, 'He must be an important guy!' Wonder how
  he got it? I'll bet he wined and dined the superintendent of the Motor
  License Bureau to a fare-you-well!"</p>

  <p>Then Chum Frink addressed them:</p>

  <p>"Some of you may feel that it's out of place here to talk on a strictly
  highbrow and artistic subject, but I want to come out flatfooted and ask you
  boys to O.K. the proposition of a Symphony Orchestra for Zenith. Now, where a
  lot of you make your mistake is in assuming that if you don't like classical
  music and all that junk, you ought to oppose it. Now, I want to confess that,
  though I'm a literary guy by profession, I don't care a rap for all this
  long-haired music. I'd rather listen to a good jazz band any time than to
  some piece by Beethoven that hasn't any more tune to it than a bunch of
  fighting cats, and you couldn't whistle it to save your life! But that isn't
  the point. Culture has become as necessary an adornment and advertisement for
  a city to-day as pavements or bank-clearances. It's Culture, in theaters and
  art-galleries and so on, that brings thousands of visitors to New York every
  year and, to be frank, for all our splendid attainments we haven't yet got
  the Culture of a New York or Chicago or Boston&mdash;or at least we don't get
  the credit for it. The thing to do then, as a live bunch of go-getters, is to
  <i>capitalize Culture</i>; to go right out and grab it.</p>

  <p>"Pictures and books are fine for those that have the time to study 'em,
  but they don't shoot out on the road and holler 'This is what little old
  Zenith can put up in the way of Culture.' That's precisely what a Symphony
  Orchestra does do. Look at the credit Minneapolis and Cincinnati get. An
  orchestra with first-class musickers and a swell conductor&mdash;and I
  believe we ought to do the thing up brown and get one of the highest-paid
  conductors on the market, providing he ain't a Hun&mdash;it goes right into
  Beantown and New York and Washington; it plays at the best theaters to the
  most cultured and moneyed people; it gives such class-advertising as a town
  can get in no other way; and the guy who is so short-sighted as to crab this
  orchestra proposition is passing up the chance to impress the glorious name
  of Zenith on some big New York millionaire that might-that might establish a
  branch factory here!</p>

  <p>"I could also go into the fact that for our daughters who show an interest
  in highbrow music and may want to teach it, having an A1 local organization
  is of great benefit, but let's keep this on a practical basis, and I call on
  you good brothers to whoop it up for Culture and a World-beating Symphony
  Orchestra!"</p>

  <p>They applauded.</p>

  <p>To a rustle of excitement President Gunch proclaimed, "Gentlemen, we will
  now proceed to the annual election of officers." For each of the six offices,
  three candidates had been chosen by a committee. The second name among the
  candidates for vice-president was Babbitt's.</p>

  <p>He was surprised. He looked self-conscious. His heart pounded. He was
  still more agitated when the ballots were counted and Gunch said, "It's a
  pleasure to announce that Georgie Babbitt will be the next assistant
  gavel-wielder. I know of no man who stands more stanchly for common sense and
  enterprise than good old George. Come on, let's give him our best long
  yell!"</p>

  <p>As they adjourned, a hundred men crushed in to slap his back. He had never
  known a higher moment. He drove away in a blur of wonder. He lunged into his
  office, chuckling to Miss McGoun, "Well, I guess you better congratulate your
  boss! Been elected vice-president of the Boosters!"</p>

  <p>He was disappointed. She answered only, "Yes&mdash;Oh, Mrs. Babbitt's been
  trying to get you on the 'phone." But the new salesman, Fritz Weilinger,
  said, "By golly, chief, say, that's great, that's perfectly great! I'm
  tickled to death! Congratulations!"</p>

  <p>Babbitt called the house, and crowed to his wife, "Heard you were trying
  to get me, Myra. Say, you got to hand it to little Georgie, this time! Better
  talk careful! You are now addressing the vice-president of the Boosters'
  Club!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Georgie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pretty nice, huh? Willis Ijams is the new president, but when he's away,
  little ole Georgie takes the gavel and whoops 'em up and introduces the
  speakers&mdash;no matter if they're the governor
  himself&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"George! Listen!"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;It puts him in solid with big men like Doc Dilling and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"George! Paul Riesling&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sure, I'll 'phone Paul and let him know about it right away."</p>

  <p>"Georgie! <i>Listen</i>! Paul's in jail. He shot his wife, he shot Zilla,
  this noon. She may not live."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">He drove to the City Prison, not blindly, but with unusual
  fussy care at corners, the fussiness of an old woman potting plants. It kept
  him from facing the obscenity of fate.</p>

  <p>The attendant said, "Naw, you can't see any of the prisoners till
  three-thirty&mdash;visiting-hour."</p>

  <p>It was three. For half an hour Babbitt sat looking at a calendar and a
  clock on a whitewashed wall. The chair was hard and mean and creaky. People
  went through the office and, he thought, stared at him. He felt a belligerent
  defiance which broke into a wincing fear of this machine which was grinding
  Paul&mdash;Paul&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>Exactly at half-past three he sent in his name.</p>

  <p>The attendant returned with "Riesling says he don't want to see you."</p>

  <p>"You're crazy! You didn't give him my name! Tell him it's George wants to
  see him, George Babbitt."</p>

  <p>"Yuh, I told him, all right, all right! He said he didn't want to see
  you."</p>

  <p>"Then take me in anyway."</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing. If you ain't his lawyer, if he don't want to see you,
  that's all there is to it."</p>

  <p>"But, my <i>God</i>&mdash;Say, let me see the warden."</p>

  <p>"He's busy. Come on, now, you&mdash;" Babbitt reared over him. The
  attendant hastily changed to a coaxing "You can come back and try to-morrow.
  Probably the poor guy is off his nut."</p>

  <p>Babbitt drove, not at all carefully or fussily, sliding viciously past
  trucks, ignoring the truckmen's curses, to the City Hall; he stopped with a
  grind of wheels against the curb, and ran up the marble steps to the office
  of the Hon. Mr. Lucas Prout, the mayor. He bribed the mayor's doorman with a
  dollar; he was instantly inside, demanding, "You remember me, Mr. Prout?
  Babbitt&mdash;vice-president of the Boosters&mdash;campaigned for you? Say,
  have you heard about poor Riesling? Well, I want an order on the warden or
  whatever you call um of the City Prison to take me back and see him. Good.
  Thanks."</p>

  <p>In fifteen minutes he was pounding down the prison corridor to a cage
  where Paul Riesling sat on a cot, twisted like an old beggar, legs crossed,
  arms in a knot, biting at his clenched fist.</p>

  <p>Paul looked up blankly as the keeper unlocked the cell, admitted Babbitt,
  and left them together. He spoke slowly: "Go on! Be moral!"</p>

  <p>Babbitt plumped on the couch beside him. "I'm not going to be moral! I
  don't care what happened! I just want to do anything I can. I'm glad Zilla
  got what was coming to her."</p>

  <p>Paul said argumentatively, "Now, don't go jumping on Zilla. I've been
  thinking; maybe she hasn't had any too easy a time. Just after I shot
  her&mdash;I didn't hardly mean to, but she got to deviling me so I went
  crazy, just for a second, and pulled out that old revolver you and I used to
  shoot rabbits with, and took a crack at her. Didn't hardly mean
  to&mdash;After that, when I was trying to stop the blood&mdash;It was
  terrible what it did to her shoulder, and she had beautiful skin&mdash;Maybe
  she won't die. I hope it won't leave her skin all scarred. But just
  afterward, when I was hunting through the bathroom for some cotton to stop
  the blood, I ran onto a little fuzzy yellow duck we hung on the tree one
  Christmas, and I remembered she and I'd been awfully happy then&mdash;Hell. I
  can't hardly believe it's me here." As Babbitt's arm tightened about his
  shoulder, Paul sighed, "I'm glad you came. But I thought maybe you'd lecture
  me, and when you've committed a murder, and been brought here and
  everything&mdash;there was a big crowd outside the apartment house, all
  staring, and the cops took me through it&mdash;Oh, I'm not going to talk
  about it any more."</p>

  <p>But he went on, in a monotonous, terrified insane mumble. To divert him
  Babbitt said, "Why, you got a scar on your cheek."</p>

  <p>"Yes. That's where the cop hit me. I suppose cops get a lot of fun out of
  lecturing murderers, too. He was a big fellow. And they wouldn't let me help
  carry Zilla down to the ambulance."</p>

  <p>"Paul! Quit it! Listen: she won't die, and when it's all over you and I'll
  go off to Maine again. And maybe we can get that May Arnold to go along. I'll
  go up to Chicago and ask her. Good woman, by golly. And afterwards I'll see
  that you get started in business out West somewhere, maybe Seattle&mdash;they
  say that's a lovely city."</p>

  <p>Paul was half smiling. It was Babbitt who rambled now. He could not tell
  whether Paul was heeding, but he droned on till the coming of Paul's lawyer,
  P. J. Maxwell, a thin, busy, unfriendly man who nodded at Babbitt and hinted,
  "If Riesling and I could be alone for a moment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Babbitt wrung Paul's hands, and waited in the office till Maxwell came
  pattering out. "Look, old man, what can I do?" he begged.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Not a thing. Not just now," said Maxwell. "Sorry. Got to hurry.
  And don't try to see him. I've had the doctor give him a shot of morphine, so
  he'll sleep."</p>

  <p>It seemed somehow wicked to return to the office. Babbitt felt as though
  he had just come from a funeral. He drifted out to the City Hospital to
  inquire about Zilla. She was not likely to die, he learned. The bullet from
  Paul's huge old .44 army revolver had smashed her shoulder and torn upward
  and out.</p>

  <p>He wandered home and found his wife radiant with the horified interest we
  have in the tragedies of our friends. "Of course Paul isn't altogether to
  blame, but this is what comes of his chasing after other women instead of
  bearing his cross in a Christian way," she exulted.</p>

  <p>He was too languid to respond as he desired. He said what was to be said
  about the Christian bearing of crosses, and went out to clean the car. Dully,
  patiently, he scraped linty grease from the drip-pan, gouged at the mud caked
  on the wheels. He used up many minutes in washing his hands; scoured them
  with gritty kitchen soap; rejoiced in hurting his plump knuckles. "Damn soft
  hands&mdash;like a woman's. Aah!"</p>

  <p>At dinner, when his wife began the inevitable, he bellowed, "I forbid any
  of you to say a word about Paul! I'll 'tend to all the talking about this
  that's necessary, hear me? There's going to be one house in this
  scandal-mongering town to-night that isn't going to spring the
  holier-than-thou. And throw those filthy evening papers out of the
  house!"</p>

  <p>But he himself read the papers, after dinner.</p>

  <p>Before nine he set out for the house of Lawyer Maxwell. He was received
  without cordiality. "Well?" said Maxwell.</p>

  <p>"I want to offer my services in the trial. I've got an idea. Why couldn't
  I go on the stand and swear I was there, and she pulled the gun first and he
  wrestled with her and the gun went off accidentally?"</p>

  <p>"And perjure yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Huh? Yes, I suppose it would be perjury. Oh&mdash;Would it help?"</p>

  <p>"But, my dear fellow! Perjury!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be a fool! Excuse me, Maxwell; I didn't mean to get your goat.
  I just mean: I've known and you've known many and many a case of perjury,
  just to annex some rotten little piece of real estate, and here where it's a
  case of saving Paul from going to prison, I'd perjure myself black in the
  face."</p>

  <p>"No. Aside from the ethics of the matter, I'm afraid it isn't practicable.
  The prosecutor would tear your testimony to pieces. It's known that only
  Riesling and his wife were there at the time."</p>

  <p>"Then, look here! Let me go on the stand and swear&mdash;and this would be
  the God's truth&mdash;that she pestered him till he kind of went crazy."</p>

  <p>"No. Sorry. Riesling absolutely refuses to have any testimony reflecting
  on his wife. He insists on pleading guilty."</p>

  <p>"Then let me get up and testify something&mdash;whatever you say. Let me
  do <i>something</i>!"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Babbitt, but the best thing you can do&mdash;I hate to say it,
  but you could help us most by keeping strictly out of it."</p>

  <p>Babbitt, revolving his hat like a defaulting poor tenant, winced so
  visibly that Maxwell condescended:</p>

  <p>"I don't like to hurt your feelings, but you see we both want to do our
  best for Riesling, and we mustn't consider any other factor. The trouble with
  you, Babbitt, is that you're one of these fellows who talk too readily. You
  like to hear your own voice. If there were anything for which I could put you
  in the witness-box, you'd get going and give the whole show away. Sorry. Now
  I must look over some papers&mdash;So sorry."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">He spent most of the next morning nerving himself to face
  the garrulous world of the Athletic Club. They would talk about Paul; they
  would be lip-licking and rotten. But at the Roughnecks' Table they did not
  mention Paul. They spoke with zeal of the coming baseball season. He loved
  them as he never had before.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">He had, doubtless from some story-book, pictured Paul's
  trial as a long struggle, with bitter arguments, a taut crowd, and sudden and
  overwhelming new testimony. Actually, the trial occupied less than fifteen
  minutes, largely filled with the evidence of doctors that Zilla would recover
  and that Paul must have been temporarily insane. Next day Paul was sentenced
  to three years in the State Penitentiary and taken off&mdash;quite
  undramatically, not handcuffed, merely plodding in a tired way beside a
  cheerful deputy sheriff&mdash;and after saying good-by to him at the station
  Babbitt returned to his office to realize that he faced a world which,
  without Paul, was meaningless.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">He was busy, from March to June. He kept himself from the
  bewilderment of thinking. His wife and the neighbors were generous. Every
  evening he played bridge or attended the movies, and the days were blank of
  face and silent.</p>

  <p>In June, Mrs. Babbitt and Tinka went East, to stay with relatives, and
  Babbitt was free to do&mdash;he was not quite sure what.</p>

  <p>All day long after their departure he thought of the emancipated house in
  which he could, if he desired, go mad and curse the gods without having to
  keep up a husbandly front. He considered, "I could have a reg'lar party
  to-night; stay out till two and not do any explaining afterwards. Cheers!" He
  telephoned to Vergil Gunch, to Eddie Swanson. Both of them were engaged for
  the evening, and suddenly he was bored by having to take so much trouble to
  be riotous.</p>

  <p>He was silent at dinner, unusually kindly to Ted and Verona, hesitating
  but not disapproving when Verona stated her opinion of Kenneth Escott's
  opinion of Dr. John Jennison Drew's opinion of the opinions of the
  evolutionists. Ted was working in a garage through the summer vacation, and
  he related his daily triumphs: how he had found a cracked ball-race, what he
  had said to the Old Grouch, what he had said to the foreman about the future
  of wireless telephony.</p>

  <p>Ted and Verona went to a dance after dinner. Even the maid was out. Rarely
  had Babbitt been alone in the house for an entire evening. He was restless.
  He vaguely wanted something more diverting than the newspaper comic strips to
  read. He ambled up to Verona's room, sat on her maidenly blue and white bed,
  humming and grunting in a solid-citizen manner as he examined her books:
  Conrad's "Rescue," a volume strangely named "Figures of Earth," poetry (quite
  irregular poetry, Babbitt thought) by Vachel Lindsay, and essays by H. L.
  Mencken&mdash;highly improper essays, making fun of the church and all the
  decencies. He liked none of the books. In them he felt a spirit of rebellion
  against niceness and solid-citizenship. These authors&mdash;and he supposed
  they were famous ones, too&mdash;did not seem to care about telling a good
  story which would enable a fellow to forget his troubles. He sighed. He noted
  a book, "The Three Black Pennies," by Joseph Hergesheimer. Ah, that was
  something like it! It would be an adventure story, maybe about
  counterfeiting&mdash;detectives sneaking up on the old house at night. He
  tucked the book under his arm, he clumped down-stairs and solemnly began to
  read, under the piano-lamp:</p>

  <p>"A twilight like blue dust sifted into the shallow fold of the thickly
  wooded hills. It was early October, but a crisping frost had already stamped
  the maple trees with gold, the Spanish oaks were hung with patches of wine
  red, the sumach was brilliant in the darkening underbrush. A pattern of wild
  geese, flying low and unconcerned above the hills, wavered against the serene
  ashen evening. Howat Penny, standing in the comparative clearing of a road,
  decided that the shifting regular flight would not come close enough for a
  shot...He had no intention of hunting the geese. With the drooping of day his
  keenness had evaporated; an habitual indifference strengthened, permeating
  him..."</p>

  <p>There it was again: discontent with the good common ways. Babbitt laid
  down the book and listened to the stillness. The inner doors of the house
  were open. He heard from the kitchen the steady drip of the refrigerator, a
  rhythm demanding and disquieting. He roamed to the window. The summer evening
  was foggy and, seen through the wire screen, the street lamps were crosses of
  pale fire. The whole world was abnormal. While he brooded, Verona and Ted
  came in and went up to bed. Silence thickened in the sleeping house. He put
  on his hat, his respectable derby, lighted a cigar, and walked up and down
  before the house, a portly, worthy, unimaginative figure, humming "Silver
  Threads among the Gold." He casually considered, "Might call up Paul." Then
  he remembered. He saw Paul in a jailbird's uniform, but while he agonized he
  didn't believe the tale. It was part of the unreality of this fog-enchanted
  evening.</p>

  <p>If she were here Myra would be hinting, "Isn't it late, Georgie?" He
  tramped in forlorn and unwanted freedom. Fog hid the house now. The world was
  uncreated, a chaos without turmoil or desire.</p>

  <p>Through the mist came a man at so feverish a pace that he seemed to dance
  with fury as he entered the orb of glow from a street-lamp. At each step he
  brandished his stick and brought it down with a crash. His glasses on their
  broad pretentious ribbon banged against his stomach. Babbitt incredulously
  saw that it was Chum Frink.</p>

  <p>Frink stopped, focused his vision, and spoke with gravity:</p>

  <p>"There's another fool. George Babbitt. Lives for renting
  howshes&mdash;houses. Know who I am? I'm traitor to poetry. I'm drunk. I'm
  talking too much. I don't care. Know what I could 've been? I could 've been
  a Gene Field or a James Whitcomb Riley. Maybe a Stevenson. I could 've.
  Whimsies. 'Magination. Lissen. Lissen to this. Just made it up:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Glittering summery meadowy noise<br>
  Of beetles and bums and respectable boys.</p><br>

  <p>Hear that? Whimzh&mdash;whimsy. I made that up. I don't know what it
  means! Beginning good verse. Chile's Garden Verses. And whadi write? Tripe!
  Cheer-up poems. All tripe! Could have written&mdash;Too late!"</p>

  <p>He darted on with an alarming plunge, seeming always to pitch forward yet
  never quite falling. Babbitt would have been no more astonished and no less
  had a ghost skipped out of the fog carrying his head. He accepted Frink with
  vast apathy; he grunted, "Poor boob!" and straightway forgot him.</p>

  <p>He plodded into the house, deliberately went to the refrigerator and
  rifled it. When Mrs. Babbitt was at home, this was one of the major household
  crimes. He stood before the covered laundry tubs, eating a chicken leg and
  half a saucer of raspberry jelly, and grumbling over a clammy cold boiled
  potato. He was thinking. It was coming to him that perhaps all life as he
  knew it and vigorously practised it was futile; that heaven as portrayed by
  the Reverend Dr. John Jennison Drew was neither probable nor very
  interesting; that he hadn't much pleasure out of making money; that it was of
  doubtful worth to rear children merely that they might rear children who
  would rear children. What was it all about? What did he want?</p>

  <p>He blundered into the living-room, lay on the davenport, hands behind his
  head.</p>

  <p>What did he want? Wealth? Social position? Travel? Servants? Yes, but only
  incidentally.</p>

  <p>"I give it up," he sighed.</p>

  <p>But he did know that he wanted the presence of Paul Riesling; and from
  that he stumbled into the admission that he wanted the fairy girl&mdash;in
  the flesh. If there had been a woman whom he loved, he would have fled to
  her, humbled his forehead on her knees.</p>

  <p>He thought of his stenographer, Miss McGoun. He thought of the prettiest
  of the manicure girls at the Hotel Thornleigh barber shop. As he fell asleep
  on the davenport he felt that he had found something in life, and that he had
  made a terrifying, thrilling break with everything that was decent and
  normal.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">He had forgotten, next morning, that he was a conscious
  rebel, but he was irritable in the office and at the eleven o'clock drive of
  telephone calls and visitors he did something he had often desired and never
  dared: he left the office without excuses to those stave-drivers his
  employees, and went to the movies. He enjoyed the right to be alone. He came
  out with a vicious determination to do what he pleased.</p>

  <p>As he approached the Roughnecks' Table at the club, everybody laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, here's the millionaire!" said Sidney Finkelstein.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw him in his Locomobile!" said Professor Pumphrey.</p>

  <p>"Gosh, it must be great to be a smart guy like Georgie!" moaned Vergil
  Gunch. "He's probably stolen all of Dorchester. I'd hate to leave a poor
  little defenseless piece of property lying around where he could get his
  hooks on it!"</p>

  <p>They had, Babbitt perceived, "something on him." Also, they "had their
  kidding clothes on." Ordinarily he would have been delighted at the honor
  implied in being chaffed, but he was suddenly touchy. He grunted, "Yuh, sure;
  maybe I'll take you guys on as office boys!" He was impatient as the jest
  elaborately rolled on to its denouement.</p>

  <p>"Of course he may have been meeting a girl," they said, and "No, I think
  he was waiting for his old roommate, Sir Jerusalem Doak."</p>

  <p>He exploded, "Oh, spring it, spring it, you boneheads! What's the great
  joke?"</p>

  <p>"Hurray! George is peeved!" snickered Sidney Finkelstein, while a grin
  went round the table. Gunch revealed the shocking truth: He had seen Babbitt
  coming out of a motion-picture theater&mdash;at noon!</p>

  <p>They kept it up. With a hundred variations, a hundred guffaws, they said
  that he had gone to the movies during business-hours. He didn't so much mind
  Gunch, but he was annoyed by Sidney Finkelstein, that brisk, lean, red-headed
  explainer of jokes. He was bothered, too, by the lump of ice in his glass of
  water. It was too large; it spun round and burned his nose when he tried to
  drink. He raged that Finkelstein was like that lump of ice. But he won
  through; he kept up his banter till they grew tired of the superlative jest
  and turned to the great problems of the day.</p>

  <p>He reflected, "What's the matter with me to-day? Seems like I've got an
  awful grouch. Only they talk so darn much. But I better steer careful and
  keep my mouth shut."</p>

  <p>As they lighted their cigars he mumbled, "Got to get back," and on a
  chorus of "If you <i>will</i> go spending your mornings with lady ushers at
  the movies!" he escaped. He heard them giggling. He was embarrassed. While he
  was most bombastically agreeing with the coat-man that the weather was warm,
  he was conscious that he was longing to run childishly with his troubles to
  the comfort of the fairy child.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">He kept Miss McGoun after he had finished dictating. He
  searched for a topic which would warm her office impersonality into
  friendliness.</p>

  <p>"Where you going on your vacation?" he purred.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll go up-state to a farm do you want me to have the Siddons
  lease copied this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no hurry about it...I suppose you have a great time when you get away
  from us cranks in the office."</p>

  <p>She rose and gathered her pencils. "Oh, nobody's cranky here I think I can
  get it copied after I do the letters."</p>

  <p>She was gone. Babbitt utterly repudiated the view that he had been trying
  to discover how approachable was Miss McGoun. "Course! knew there was nothing
  doing!" he said.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">Eddie Swanson, the motor-car agent who lived across the
  street from Babbitt, was giving a Sunday supper. His wife Louetta, young
  Louetta who loved jazz in music and in clothes and laughter, was at her
  wildest. She cried, "We'll have a real party!" as she received the guests.
  Babbitt had uneasily felt that to many men she might be alluring; now he
  admitted that to himself she was overwhelmingly alluring. Mrs. Babbitt had
  never quite approved of Louetta; Babbitt was glad that she was not here this
  evening.</p>

  <p>He insisted on helping Louetta in the kitchen: taking the chicken
  croquettes from the warming-oven, the lettuce sandwiches from the ice-box. He
  held her hand, once, and she depressingly didn't notice it. She caroled,
  "You're a good little mother's-helper, Georgie. Now trot in with the tray and
  leave it on the side-table."</p>

  <p>He wished that Eddie Swanson would give them cocktails; that Louetta would
  have one. He wanted&mdash;Oh, he wanted to be one of these Bohemians you read
  about. Studio parties. Wild lovely girls who were independent. Not
  necessarily bad. Certainly not! But not tame, like Floral Heights. How he'd
  ever stood it all these years&mdash;</p>

  <p>Eddie did not give them cocktails. True, they supped with mirth, and with
  several repetitions by Orville Jones of "Any time Louetta wants to come sit
  on my lap I'll tell this sandwich to beat it!" but they were respectable, as
  befitted Sunday evening. Babbitt had discreetly preempted a place beside
  Louetta on the piano bench. While he talked about motors, while he listened
  with a fixed smile to her account of the film she had seen last Wednesday,
  while he hoped that she would hurry up and finish her description of the
  plot, the beauty of the leading man, and the luxury of the setting, he
  studied her. Slim waist girdled with raw silk, strong brows, ardent eyes,
  hair parted above a broad forehead&mdash;she meant youth to him and a charm
  which saddened. He thought of how valiant a companion she would be on a long
  motor tour, exploring mountains, picnicking in a pine grove high above a
  valley. Her frailness touched him; he was angry at Eddie Swanson for the
  incessant family bickering. All at once he identified Louetta with the fairy
  girl. He was startled by the conviction that they had always had a romantic
  attraction for each other.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're leading a simply terrible life, now you're a widower,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"You bet! I'm a bad little fellow and proud of it. Some evening you slip
  Eddie some dope in his coffee and sneak across the road and I'll show you how
  to mix a cocktail," he roared.</p>

  <p>"Well, now, I might do it! You never can tell!"</p>

  <p>"Well, whenever you're ready, you just hang a towel out of the attic
  window and I'll jump for the gin!"</p>

  <p>Every one giggled at this naughtiness. In a pleased way Eddie Swanson
  stated that he would have a physician analyze his coffee daily. The others
  were diverted to a discussion of the more agreeable recent murders, but
  Babbitt drew Louetta back to personal things:</p>

  <p>"That's the prettiest dress I ever saw in my life."</p>

  <p>"Do you honestly like it?"</p>

  <p>"Like it? Why, say, I'm going to have Kenneth Escott put a piece in the
  paper saying that the swellest dressed woman in the U. S. is Mrs. E. Louetta
  Swanson."</p>

  <p>"Now, you stop teasing me!" But she beamed. "Let's dance a little. George,
  you've got to dance with me."</p>

  <p>Even as he protested, "Oh, you know what a rotten dancer I am!" he was
  lumbering to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I'll teach you. I can teach anybody."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were moist, her voice was jagged with excitement. He was
  convinced that he had won her. He clasped her, conscious of her smooth
  warmth, and solemnly he circled in a heavy version of the one-step. He bumped
  into only one or two people. "Gosh, I'm not doing so bad; hittin' 'em up like
  a regular stage dancer!" he gloated; and she answered busily,
  "Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I told you I could teach anybody&mdash;<i>don't take
  such long steps</i>!"</p>

  <p>For a moment he was robbed of confidence; with fearful concentration he
  sought to keep time to the music. But he was enveloped again by her
  enchantment. "She's got to like me; I'll make her!" he vowed. He tried to
  kiss the lock beside her ear. She mechanically moved her head to avoid it,
  and mechanically she murmured, "Don't!"</p>

  <p>For a moment he hated her, but after the moment he was as urgent as ever.
  He danced with Mrs. Orville Jones, but he watched Louetta swooping down the
  length of the room with her husband. "Careful! You're getting foolish!" he
  cautioned himself, the while he hopped and bent his solid knees in dalliance
  with Mrs. Jones, and to that worthy lady rumbled, "Gee, it's hot!" Without
  reason, he thought of Paul in that shadowy place where men never dance. "I'm
  crazy to-night; better go home," he worried, but he left Mrs. Jones and
  dashed to Louetta's lovely side, demanding, "The next is mine."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm so hot; I'm not going to dance this one."</p>

  <p>"Then," boldly, "come out and sit on the porch and get all nice and
  cool."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In the tender darkness, with the clamor in the house behind them, he
  resolutely took her hand. She squeezed his once, then relaxed.</p>

  <p>"Louetta! I think you're the nicest thing I know!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I think you're very nice."</p>

  <p>"Do you? You got to like me! I'm so lonely!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you'll be all right when your wife comes home."</p>

  <p>"No, I'm always lonely."</p>

  <p>She clasped her hands under her chin, so that he dared not touch her. He
  sighed:</p>

  <p>"When I feel punk and&mdash;" He was about to bring in the tragedy of
  Paul, but that was too sacred even for the diplomacy of love. "&mdash;when I
  get tired out at the office and everything, I like to look across the street
  and think of you. Do you know I dreamed of you, one time!"</p>

  <p>"Was it a nice dream?"</p>

  <p>"Lovely!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, they say dreams go by opposites! Now I must run in."</p>

  <p>She was on her feet.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't go in yet! Please, Louetta!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I must. Have to look out for my guests."</p>

  <p>"Let 'em look out for 'emselves!"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't do that." She carelessly tapped his shoulder and slipped
  away.</p>

  <p>But after two minutes of shamed and childish longing to sneak home he was
  snorting, "Certainly I wasn't trying to get chummy with her! Knew there was
  nothing doing, all the time!" and he ambled in to dance with Mrs. Orville
  Jones, and to avoid Louetta, virtuously and conspicuously.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">His visit to Paul was as unreal as his night of fog and
  questioning. Unseeing he went through prison corridors stinking of carbolic
  acid to a room lined with pale yellow settees pierced in rosettes, like the
  shoe-store benches he had known as a boy. The guard led in Paul. Above his
  uniform of linty gray, Paul's face was pale and without expression. He moved
  timorously in response to the guard's commands; he meekly pushed Babbitt's
  gifts of tobacco and magazines across the table to the guard for examination.
  He had nothing to say but "Oh, I'm getting used to it" and "I'm working in
  the tailor shop; the stuff hurts my fingers."</p>

  <p>Babbitt knew that in this place of death Paul was already dead. And as he
  pondered on the train home something in his own self seemed to have died: a
  loyal and vigorous faith in the goodness of the world, a fear of public
  disfavor, a pride in success. He was glad that his wife was away. He admitted
  it without justifying it. He did not care.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Her card read "Mrs. Daniel Judique." Babbitt knew of her as
  the widow of a wholesale paper-dealer. She must have been forty or forty-two
  but he thought her younger when he saw her in the office, that afternoon. She
  had come to inquire about renting an apartment, and he took her away from the
  unskilled girl accountant. He was nervously attracted by her smartness. She
  was a slender woman, in a black Swiss frock dotted with white, a cool-looking
  graceful frock. A broad black hat shaded her face. Her eyes were lustrous,
  her soft chin of an agreeable plumpness, and her cheeks an even rose. Babbitt
  wondered afterward if she was made up, but no man living knew less of such
  arts.</p>

  <p>She sat revolving her violet parasol. Her voice was appealing without
  being coy. "I wonder if you can help me?"</p>

  <p>"Be delighted."</p>

  <p>"I've looked everywhere and&mdash;I want a little flat, just a bedroom, or
  perhaps two, and sitting-room and kitchenette and bath, but I want one that
  really has some charm to it, not these dingy places or these new ones with
  terrible gaudy chandeliers. And I can't pay so dreadfully much. My name's
  Tanis Judique."</p>

  <p>"I think maybe I've got just the thing for you. Would you like to chase
  around and look at it now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have a couple of hours."</p>

  <p>In the new Cavendish Apartments, Babbitt had a flat which he had been
  holding for Sidney Finkelstein, but at the thought of driving beside this
  agreeable woman he threw over his friend Finkelstein, and with a note of
  gallantry he proclaimed, "I'll let you see what I can do!"</p>

  <p>He dusted the seat of the car for her, and twice he risked death in
  showing off his driving.</p>

  <p>"You do know how to handle a car!" she said.</p>

  <p>He liked her voice. There was, he thought, music in it and a hint of
  culture, not a bouncing giggle like Louetta Swanson's.</p>

  <p>He boasted, "You know, there's a lot of these fellows that are so scared
  and drive so slow that they get in everybody's way. The safest driver is a
  fellow that knows how to handle his machine and yet isn't scared to speed up
  when it's necessary, don't you think so?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes!"</p>

  <p>"I bet you drive like a wiz."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;I mean&mdash;not really. Of course, we had a car&mdash;I
  mean, before my husband passed on&mdash;and I used to make believe drive it,
  but I don't think any woman ever learns to drive like a man."</p>

  <p>"Well, now, there's some mighty good woman drivers."</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course, these women that try to imitate men, and play golf and
  everything, and ruin their complexions and spoil their hands!"</p>

  <p>"That's so. I never did like these mannish females."</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;of course, I admire them, dreadfully, and I feel so weak and
  useless beside them."</p>

  <p>"Oh, rats now! I bet you play the piano like a wiz."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;I mean&mdash;not really."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll bet you do!" He glanced at her smooth hands, her diamond and
  ruby rings. She caught the glance, snuggled her hands together with a
  kittenish curving of slim white fingers which delighted him, and yearned:</p>

  <p>"I do love to play&mdash;I mean&mdash;I like to drum on the piano, but I
  haven't had any real training. Mr. Judique used to say I would 've been a
  good pianist if I'd had any training, but then, I guess he was just
  flattering me."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet he wasn't! I'll bet you've got temperament."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;Do you like music, Mr Babbitt?"</p>

  <p>"You bet I do! Only I don't know 's I care so much for all this classical
  stuff."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I do! I just love Chopin and all those."</p>

  <p>"Do you, honest? Well, of course, I go to lots of these highbrow concerts,
  but I do like a good jazz orchestra, right up on its toes, with the fellow
  that plays the bass fiddle spinning it around and beating it up with the
  bow."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know. I do love good dance music. I love to dance, don't you, Mr.
  Babbitt?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, you bet. Not that I'm very darn good at it, though."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm sure you are. You ought to let me teach you. I can teach anybody
  to dance."</p>

  <p>"Would you give me a lesson some time?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I would."</p>

  <p>"Better be careful, or I'll be taking you up on that proposition. I'll be
  coming up to your flat and making you give me that lesson."</p>

  <p>"Ye-es." She was not offended, but she was non-committal. He warned
  himself, "Have some sense now, you chump! Don't go making a fool of yourself
  again!" and with loftiness he discoursed:</p>

  <p>"I wish I could dance like some of these young fellows, but I'll tell you:
  I feel it's a man's place to take a full, you might say, a creative share in
  the world's work and mold conditions and have something to show for his life,
  don't you think so?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I do!"</p>

  <p>"And so I have to sacrifice some of the things I might like to tackle,
  though I do, by golly, play about as good a game of golf as the next
  fellow!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm sure you do...Are you married?"</p>

  <p>"Uh&mdash;yes...And, uh, of course official duties I'm the vice-president
  of the Boosters' Club, and I'm running one of the committees of the State
  Association of Real Estate Boards, and that means a lot of work and
  responsibility&mdash;and practically no gratitude for it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know! Public men never do get proper credit."</p>

  <p>They looked at each other with a high degree of mutual respect, and at the
  Cavendish Apartments he helped her out in a courtly manner, waved his hand at
  the house as though he were presenting it to her, and ponderously ordered the
  elevator boy to "hustle and get the keys." She stood close to him in the
  elevator, and he was stirred but cautious.</p>

  <p>It was a pretty flat, of white woodwork and soft blue walls. Mrs. Judique
  gushed with pleasure as she agreed to take it, and as they walked down the
  hall to the elevator she touched his sleeve, caroling, "Oh, I'm so glad I
  went to you! It's such a privilege to meet a man who really Understands. Oh!
  The flats <i>some</i> people have showed me!"</p>

  <p>He had a sharp instinctive belief that he could put his arm around her,
  but he rebuked himself and with excessive politeness he saw her to the car,
  drove her home. All the way back to his office he raged:</p>

  <p>"Glad I had some sense for once...Curse it, I wish I'd tried. She's a
  darling! A corker! A reg'lar charmer! Lovely eyes and darling lips and that
  trim waist&mdash;never get sloppy, like some women...No, no, no! She's a real
  cultured lady. One of the brightest little women I've met these many moons.
  Understands about Public Topics and&mdash;But, darn it, why didn't I
  try?...Tanis!"</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">He was harassed and puzzled by it, but he found that he was
  turning toward youth, as youth. The girl who especially disturbed
  him&mdash;though he had never spoken to her&mdash;was the last manicure girl
  on the right in the Pompeian Barber Shop. She was small, swift, black-haired,
  smiling. She was nineteen, perhaps, or twenty. She wore thin salmon-colored
  blouses which exhibited her shoulders and her black-ribboned camisoles.</p>

  <p>He went to the Pompeian for his fortnightly hair-trim. As always, he felt
  disloyal at deserting his neighbor, the Reeves Building Barber Shop. Then,
  for the first time, he overthrew his sense of guilt. "Doggone it, I don't
  have to go here if I don't want to! I don't own the Reeves Building! These
  barbers got nothing on me! I'll doggone well get my hair cut where I doggone
  well want to! Don't want to hear anything more about it! I'm through standing
  by people&mdash;unless I want to. It doesn't get you anywhere. I'm
  through!"</p>

  <p>The Pompeian Barber Shop was in the basement of the Hotel Thornleigh,
  largest and most dynamically modern hotel in Zenith. Curving marble steps
  with a rail of polished brass led from the hotel-lobby down to the barber
  shop. The interior was of black and white and crimson tiles, with a
  sensational ceiling of burnished gold, and a fountain in which a massive
  nymph forever emptied a scarlet cornucopia. Forty barbers and nine manicure
  girls worked desperately, and at the door six colored porters lurked to greet
  the customers, to care reverently for their hats and collars, to lead them to
  a place of waiting where, on a carpet like a tropic isle in the stretch of
  white stone floor, were a dozen leather chairs and a table heaped with
  magazines.</p>

  <p>Babbitt's porter was an obsequious gray-haired negro who did him an honor
  highly esteemed in the land of Zenith&mdash;greeted him by name. Yet Babbitt
  was unhappy. His bright particular manicure girl was engaged. She was doing
  the nails of an overdressed man and giggling with him. Babbitt hated him. He
  thought of waiting, but to stop the powerful system of the Pompeian was
  inconceivable, and he was instantly wafted into a chair.</p>

  <p>About him was luxury, rich and delicate. One votary was having a
  violet-ray facial treatment, the next an oil shampoo. Boys wheeled about
  miraculous electrical massage-machines. The barbers snatched steaming towels
  from a machine like a howitzer of polished nickel and disdainfully flung them
  away after a second's use. On the vast marble shelf facing the chairs were
  hundreds of tonics, amber and ruby and emerald. It was flattering to Babbitt
  to have two personal slaves at once&mdash;the barber and the bootblack. He
  would have been completely happy if he could also have had the manicure girl.
  The barber snipped at his hair and asked his opinion of the Havre de Grace
  races, the baseball season, and Mayor Prout. The young negro bootblack hummed
  "The Camp Meeting Blues" and polished in rhythm to his tune, drawing the
  shiny shoe-rag so taut at each stroke that it snapped like a banjo string.
  The barber was an excellent salesman. He made Babbitt feel rich and important
  by his manner of inquiring, "What is your favorite tonic, sir? Have you time
  to-day, sir, for a facial massage? Your scalp is a little tight; shall I give
  you a scalp massage?"</p>

  <p>Babbitt's best thrill was in the shampoo. The barber made his hair creamy
  with thick soap, then (as Babbitt bent over the bowl, muffled in towels)
  drenched it with hot water which prickled along his scalp, and at last ran
  the water ice-cold. At the shock, the sudden burning cold on his skull,
  Babbitt's heart thumped, his chest heaved, and his spine was an electric
  wire. It was a sensation which broke the monotony of life. He looked grandly
  about the shop as he sat up. The barber obsequiously rubbed his wet hair and
  bound it in a towel as in a turban, so that Babbitt resembled a plump pink
  calif on an ingenious and adjustable throne. The barber begged (in the manner
  of one who was a good fellow yet was overwhelmed by the splendors of the
  calif), "How about a little Eldorado Oil Rub, sir? Very beneficial to the
  scalp, sir. Didn't I give you one the last time?"</p>

  <p>He hadn't, but Babbitt agreed, "Well, all right."</p>

  <p>With quaking eagerness he saw that his manicure girl was free.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, I guess I'll have a manicure after all," he droned, and
  excitedly watched her coming, dark-haired, smiling, tender, little. The
  manicuring would have to be finished at her table, and he would be able to
  talk to her without the barber listening. He waited contentedly, not trying
  to peep at her, while she filed his nails and the barber shaved him and
  smeared on his burning cheeks all the interesting mixtures which the pleasant
  minds of barbers have devised through the revolving ages. When the barber was
  done and he sat opposite the girl at her table, he admired the marble slab of
  it, admired the sunken set bowl with its tiny silver taps, and admired
  himself for being able to frequent so costly a place. When she withdrew his
  wet hand from the bowl, it was so sensitive from the warm soapy water that he
  was abnormally aware of the clasp of her firm little paw. He delighted in the
  pinkness and glossiness of her nails. Her hands seemed to him more adorable
  than Mrs. Judique's thin fingers, and more elegant. He had a certain ecstasy
  in the pain when she gnawed at the cuticle of his nails with a sharp knife.
  He struggled not to look at the outline of her young bosom and her shoulders,
  the more apparent under a film of pink chiffon. He was conscious of her as an
  exquisite thing, and when he tried to impress his personality on her he spoke
  as awkwardly as a country boy at his first party:</p>

  <p>"Well, kinda hot to be working to-day."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, it is hot. You cut your own nails, last time, didn't you!"</p>

  <p>"Ye-es, guess I must 've."</p>

  <p>"You always ought to go to a manicure."</p>

  <p>"Yes, maybe that's so. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's nothing looks so nice as nails that are looked after good. I
  always think that's the best way to spot a real gent. There was an auto
  salesman in here yesterday that claimed you could always tell a fellow's
  class by the car he drove, but I says to him, 'Don't be silly,' I says; 'the
  wisenheimers grab a look at a fellow's nails when they want to tell if he's a
  tin-horn or a real gent!"'</p>

  <p>"Yes, maybe there's something to that. Course, that is&mdash;with a pretty
  kiddy like you, a man can't help coming to get his mitts done."</p>

  <p>"Yeh, I may be a kid, but I'm a wise bird, and I know nice folks when I
  see um&mdash;I can read character at a glance&mdash;and I'd never talk so
  frank with a fellow if I couldn't see he was a nice fellow."</p>

  <p>She smiled. Her eyes seemed to him as gentle as April pools. With great
  seriousness he informed himself that "there were some roughnecks who would
  think that just because a girl was a manicure girl and maybe not awful well
  educated, she was no good, but as for him, he was a democrat, and understood
  people," and he stood by the assertion that this was a fine girl, a good
  girl&mdash;but not too uncomfortably good. He inquired in a voice quick with
  sympathy:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have a lot of fellows who try to get fresh with you."</p>

  <p>"Say, gee, do I! Say, listen, there's some of these cigar-store sports
  that think because a girl's working in a barber shop, they can get away with
  anything. The things they saaaaaay! But, believe me, I know how to hop those
  birds! I just give um the north and south and ask um, 'Say, who do you think
  you're talking to?' and they fade away like love's young nightmare and oh,
  don't you want a box of nail-paste? It will keep the nails as shiny as when
  first manicured, harmless to apply and lasts for days."</p>

  <p>"Sure, I'll try some. Say&mdash;Say, it's funny; I've been coming here
  ever since the shop opened and&mdash;" With arch surprise. "&mdash;I don't
  believe I know your name!"</p>

  <p>"Don't you? My, that's funny! I don't know yours!"</p>

  <p>"Now you quit kidding me! What's the nice little name?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it ain't so darn nice. I guess it's kind of kike. But my folks ain't
  kikes. My papa's papa was a nobleman in Poland, and there was a gentleman in
  here one day, he was kind of a count or something&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Kind of a no-account, I guess you mean!"</p>

  <p>"Who's telling this, smarty? And he said he knew my papa's papa's folks in
  Poland and they had a dandy big house. Right on a lake!" Doubtfully, "Maybe
  you don't believe it?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. No. Really. Sure I do. Why not? Don't think I'm kidding you, honey,
  but every time I've noticed you I've said to myself, 'That kid has Blue Blood
  in her veins!'"</p>

  <p>"Did you, honest?"</p>

  <p>"Honest I did. Well, well, come on&mdash;now we're friends&mdash;what's
  the darling little name?"</p>

  <p>"Ida Putiak. It ain't so much-a-much of a name. I always say to Ma, I say,
  'Ma, why didn't you name me Doloress or something with some class to
  it?'"</p>

  <p>"Well, now, I think it's a scrumptious name. Ida!"</p>

  <p>"I bet I know your name!"</p>

  <p>"Well, now, not necessarily. Of course&mdash;Oh, it isn't so specially
  well known."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you Mr. Sondheim that travels for the Krackajack Kitchen Kutlery
  Ko.?"</p>

  <p>"I am not! I'm Mr. Babbitt, the real-estate broker!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, excuse me! Oh, of course. You mean here in Zenith."</p>

  <p>"Yep." With the briskness of one whose feelings have been hurt.</p>

  <p>"Oh, sure. I've read your ads. They're swell."</p>

  <p>"Um, well&mdash;You might have read about my speeches."</p>

  <p>"Course I have! I don't get much time to read but&mdash;I guess you think
  I'm an awfully silly little nit!"</p>

  <p>"I think you're a little darling!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;There's one nice thing about this job. It gives a girl a
  chance to meet some awfully nice gentlemen and improve her mind with
  conversation, and you get so you can read a guy's character at the first
  glance."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Ida; please don't think I'm getting fresh&mdash;" He was hotly
  reflecting that it would be humiliating to be rejected by this child, and
  dangerous to be accepted. If he took her to dinner, if he were seen by
  censorious friends&mdash;But he went on ardently: "Don't think I'm getting
  fresh if I suggest it would be nice for us to go out and have a little dinner
  together some evening."</p>

  <p>"I don't know as I ought to but&mdash;My gentleman-friend's always wanting
  to take me out. But maybe I could to-night."</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">There was no reason, he assured himself, why he shouldn't
  have a quiet dinner with a poor girl who would benefit by association with an
  educated and mature person like himself. But, lest some one see them and not
  understand, he would take her to Biddlemeier's Inn, on the outskirts of the
  city. They would have a pleasant drive, this hot lonely evening, and he might
  hold her hand&mdash;no, he wouldn't even do that. Ida was complaisant; her
  bare shoulders showed it only too clearly; but he'd be hanged if he'd make
  love to her merely because she expected it.</p>

  <p>Then his car broke down; something had happened to the ignition. And he
  <i>had</i> to have the car this evening! Furiously he tested the spark-plugs,
  stared at the commutator. His angriest glower did not seem to stir the sulky
  car, and in disgrace it was hauled off to a garage. With a renewed thrill he
  thought of a taxicab. There was something at once wealthy and interestingly
  wicked about a taxicab.</p>

  <p>But when he met her, on a corner two blocks from the Hotel Thornleigh, she
  said, "A taxi? Why, I thought you owned a car!"</p>

  <p>"I do. Of course I do! But it's out of commission to-night."</p>

  <p>"Oh," she remarked, as one who had heard that tale before.</p>

  <p>All the way out to Biddlemeier's Inn he tried to talk as an old friend,
  but he could not pierce the wall of her words. With interminable indignation
  she narrated her retorts to "that fresh head-barber" and the drastic things
  she would do to him if he persisted in saying that she was "better at gassing
  than at hoof-paring."</p>

  <p>At Biddlemeier's Inn they were unable to get anything to drink. The
  head-waiter refused to understand who George F. Babbitt was. They sat
  steaming before a vast mixed grill, and made conversation about baseball.
  When he tried to hold Ida's hand she said with bright friendliness, "Careful!
  That fresh waiter is rubbering." But they came out into a treacherous summer
  night, the air lazy and a little moon above transfigured maples.</p>

  <p>"Let's drive some other place, where we can get a drink and dance!" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"Sure, some other night. But I promised Ma I'd be home early
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"Rats! It's too nice to go home."</p>

  <p>"I'd just love to, but Ma would give me fits."</p>

  <p>He was trembling. She was everything that was young and exquisite. He put
  his arm about her. She snuggled against his shoulder, unafraid, and he was
  triumphant. Then she ran down the steps of the Inn, singing, "Come on,
  Georgie, we'll have a nice drive and get cool."</p>

  <p>It was a night of lovers. All along the highway into Zenith, under the low
  and gentle moon, motors were parked and dim figures were clasped in revery.
  He held out hungry hands to Ida, and when she patted them he was grateful.
  There was no sense of struggle and transition; he kissed her and simply she
  responded to his kiss, they two behind the stolid back of the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>Her hat fell off, and she broke from his embrace to reach for it.</p>

  <p>"Oh, let it be!" he implored.</p>

  <p>"Huh? My hat? Not a chance!"</p>

  <p>He waited till she had pinned it on, then his arm sank about her. She drew
  away from it, and said with maternal soothing, "Now, don't be a silly boy!
  Mustn't make Ittle Mama scold! Just sit back, dearie, and see what a swell
  night it is. If you're a good boy, maybe I'll kiss you when we say
  nighty-night. Now give me a cigarette."</p>

  <p>He was solicitous about lighting her cigarette and inquiring as to her
  comfort. Then he sat as far from her as possible. He was cold with failure.
  No one could have told Babbitt that he was a fool with more vigor, precision,
  and intelligence than he himself displayed. He reflected that from the
  standpoint of the Rev. Dr. John Jennison Drew he was a wicked man, and from
  the standpoint of Miss Ida Putiak, an old bore who had to be endured as the
  penalty attached to eating a large dinner.</p>

  <p>"Dearie, you aren't going to go and get peevish, are you?"</p>

  <p>She spoke pertly. He wanted to spank her. He brooded, "I don't have to
  take anything off this gutter-pup! Darn immigrant! Well, let's get it over as
  quick as we can, and sneak home and kick ourselves for the rest of the
  night."</p>

  <p>He snorted, "Huh? Me peevish? Why, you baby, why should I be peevish? Now,
  listen, Ida; listen to Uncle George. I want to put you wise about this
  scrapping with your head-barber all the time. I've had a lot of experience
  with employees, and let me tell you it doesn't pay to antagonize&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At the drab wooden house in which she lived he said good-night briefly and
  amiably, but as the taxicab drove off he was praying "Oh, my God!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">He awoke to stretch cheerfully as he listened to the
  sparrows, then to remember that everything was wrong; that he was determined
  to go astray, and not in the least enjoying the process. Why, he wondered,
  should he be in rebellion? What was it all about? "Why not be sensible; stop
  all this idiotic running around, and enjoy himself with his family, his
  business, the fellows at the club?" What was he getting out of rebellion?
  Misery and shame&mdash;the shame of being treated as an offensive small boy
  by a ragamuffin like Ida Putiak! And yet&mdash;Always he came back to "And
  yet." Whatever the misery, he could not regain contentment with a world
  which, once doubted, became absurd.</p>

  <p>Only, he assured himself, he was "through with this chasing after
  girls."</p>

  <p>By noontime he was not so sure even of that. If in Miss McGoun, Louetta
  Swanson, and Ida he had failed to find the lady kind and lovely, it did not
  prove that she did not exist. He was hunted by the ancient thought that
  somewhere must exist the not impossible she who would understand him, value
  him, and make him happy.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Babbitt returned in August.</p>

  <p>On her previous absences he had missed her reassuring buzz and of her
  arrival he had made a fete. Now, though he dared not hurt her by letting a
  hint of it appear in his letters, he was sorry that she was coming before he
  had found himself, and he was embarrassed by the need of meeting her and
  looking joyful.</p>

  <p>He loitered down to the station; he studied the summer-resort posters,
  lest he have to speak to acquaintances and expose his uneasiness. But he was
  well trained. When the train clanked in he was out on the cement platform,
  peering into the chair-cars, and as he saw her in the line of passengers
  moving toward the vestibule he waved his hat. At the door he embraced her,
  and announced, "Well, well, well, well, by golly, you look fine, you look
  fine." Then he was aware of Tinka. Here was something, this child with her
  absurd little nose and lively eyes, that loved him, believed him great, and
  as he clasped her, lifted and held her till she squealed, he was for the
  moment come back to his old steady self.</p>

  <p>Tinka sat beside him in the car, with one hand on the steering-wheel,
  pretending to help him drive, and he shouted back to his wife, "I'll bet the
  kid will be the best chuffer in the family! She holds the wheel like an old
  professional!"</p>

  <p>All the while he was dreading the moment when he would be alone with his
  wife and she would patiently expect him to be ardent.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">There was about the house an unofficial theory that he was
  to take his vacation alone, to spend a week or ten days in Catawba, but he
  was nagged by the memory that a year ago he had been with Paul in Maine. He
  saw himself returning; finding peace there, and the presence of Paul, in a
  life primitive and heroic. Like a shock came the thought that he actually
  could go. Only, he couldn't, really; he couldn't leave his business, and
  "Myra would think it sort of funny, his going way off there alone. Course
  he'd decided to do whatever he darned pleased, from now on, but
  still&mdash;to go way off to Maine!"</p>

  <p>He went, after lengthy meditations.</p>

  <p>With his wife, since it was inconceivable to explain that he was going to
  seek Paul's spirit in the wilderness, he frugally employed the lie prepared
  over a year ago and scarcely used at all. He said that he had to see a man in
  New York on business. He could not have explained even to himself why he drew
  from the bank several hundred dollars more than he needed, nor why he kissed
  Tinka so tenderly, and cried, "God bless you, baby!" From the train he waved
  to her till she was but a scarlet spot beside the brown bulkier presence of
  Mrs. Babbitt, at the end of a steel and cement aisle ending in vast barred
  gates. With melancholy he looked back at the last suburb of Zenith.</p>

  <p>All the way north he pictured the Maine guides: simple and strong and
  daring, jolly as they played stud-poker in their unceiled shack, wise in
  woodcraft as they tramped the forest and shot the rapids. He particularly
  remembered Joe Paradise, half Yankee, half Indian. If he could but take up a
  backwoods claim with a man like Joe, work hard with his hands, be free and
  noisy in a flannel shirt, and never come back to this dull decency!</p>

  <p>Or, like a trapper in a Northern Canada movie, plunge through the forest,
  make camp in the Rockies, a grim and wordless caveman! Why not? He
  <i>could</i> do it! There'd be enough money at home for the family to live on
  till Verona was married and Ted self-supporting. Old Henry T. would look out
  for them. Honestly! Why <i>not</i>? Really <i>live</i>&mdash;</p>

  <p>He longed for it, admitted that he longed for it, then almost believed
  that he was going lo do it. Whenever common sense snorted, "Nonsense! Folks
  don't run away from decent families and partners; just simply don't do it,
  that's all!" then Babbitt answered pleadingly, "Well, it wouldn't take any
  more nerve than for Paul to go to jail and&mdash;Lord, how I'd' like to do
  it! Moccasins-six-gun-frontier town-gamblers&mdash;sleep under the
  stars&mdash;be a regular man, with he-men like Joe Paradise&mdash;gosh!"</p>

  <p>So he came to Maine, again stood on the wharf before the camp-hotel, again
  spat heroically into the delicate and shivering water, while the pines
  rustled, the mountains glowed, and a trout leaped and fell in a sliding
  circle. He hurried to the guides' shack as to his real home, his real
  friends, long missed. They would be glad to see him. They would stand up and
  shout? "Why, here's Mr. Babbitt! He ain't one of these ordinary sports! He's
  a real guy!"</p>

  <p>In their boarded and rather littered cabin the guides sat about the greasy
  table playing stud-poker with greasy cards: half a dozen wrinkled men in old
  trousers and easy old felt hats. They glanced up and nodded. Joe Paradise,
  the swart aging man with the big mustache, grunted, "How do. Back again?"</p>

  <p>Silence, except for the clatter of chips.</p>

  <p>Babbitt stood beside them, very lonely. He hinted, after a period of
  highly concentrated playing, "Guess I might take a hand, Joe."</p>

  <p>"Sure. Sit in. How many chips you want? Let's see; you were here with your
  wife, last year, wa'n't you?" said Joe Paradise.</p>

  <p>That was all of Babbitt's welcome to the old home.</p>

  <p>He played for half an hour before he spoke again. His head was reeking
  with the smoke of pipes and cheap cigars, and he was weary of pairs and
  four-flushes, resentful of the way in which they ignored him. He flung at
  Joe:</p>

  <p>"Working now?"</p>

  <p>"Nope."</p>

  <p>"Like to guide me for a few days?"</p>

  <p>"Well, jus' soon. I ain't engaged till next week."</p>

  <p>Only thus did Joe recognize the friendship Babbitt was offering him.
  Babbitt paid up his losses and left the shack rather childishly. Joe raised
  his head from the coils of smoke like a seal rising from surf, grunted, "I'll
  come 'round t'morrow," and dived down to his three aces.</p>

  <p>Neither in his voiceless cabin, fragrant with planks of new-cut pine, nor
  along the lake, nor in the sunset clouds which presently eddied behind the
  lavender-misted mountains, could Babbitt find the spirit of Paul as a
  reassuring presence. He was so lonely that after supper he stopped to talk
  with an ancient old lady, a gasping and steadily discoursing old lady, by the
  stove in the hotel-office. He told her of Ted's presumable future triumphs in
  the State University and of Tinka's remarkable vocabulary till he was
  homesick for the home he had left forever.</p>

  <p>Through the darkness, through that Northern pine-walled silence, he
  blundered down to the lake-front and found a canoe. There were no paddles in
  it but with a board, sitting awkwardly amidships and poking at the water
  rather than paddling, he made his way far out on the lake. The lights of the
  hotel and the cottages became yellow dots, a cluster of glow-worms at the
  base of Sachem Mountain. Larger and ever more imperturbable was the mountain
  in the star-filtered darkness, and the lake a limitless pavement of black
  marble. He was dwarfed and dumb and a little awed, but that insignificance
  freed him from the pomposities of being Mr. George F. Babbitt of Zenith;
  saddened and freed his heart. Now he was conscious of the presence of Paul,
  fancied him (rescued from prison, from Zilla and the brisk exactitudes of the
  tar-roofing business) playing his violin at the end of the canoe. He vowed,
  "I will go on! I'll never go back! Now that Paul's out of it, I don't want to
  see any of those damn people again! I was a fool to get sore because Joe
  Paradise didn't jump up and hug me. He's one of these woodsmen; too wise to
  go yelping and talking your arm off like a cityman. But get him back in the
  mountains, out on the trail&mdash;! That's real living!"</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">Joe reported at Babbitt's cabin at nine the next morning.
  Babbitt greeted him as a fellow caveman:</p>

  <p>"Well, Joe, how d' you feel about hitting the trail, and getting away from
  these darn soft summerites and these women and all?"</p>

  <p>"All right, Mr. Babbitt."</p>

  <p>"What do you say we go over to Box Car Pond&mdash;they tell me the shack
  there isn't being used&mdash;and camp out?"</p>

  <p>"Well, all right, Mr. Babbitt, but it's nearer to Skowtuit Pond, and you
  can get just about as good fishing there."</p>

  <p>"No, I want to get into the real wilds."</p>

  <p>"Well, all right."</p>

  <p>"We'll put the old packs on our backs and get into the woods and really
  hike."</p>

  <p>"I think maybe it would be easier to go by water, through Lake Chogue. We
  can go all the way by motor boat&mdash;flat-bottom boat with an
  Evinrude."</p>

  <p>"No, sir! Bust up the quiet with a chugging motor? Not on your life! You
  just throw a pair of socks in the old pack, and tell 'em what you want for
  eats. I'll be ready soon 's you are."</p>

  <p>"Most of the sports go by boat, Mr. Babbitt. It's a long walk.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Joe: are you objecting to walking?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, I guess I can do it. But I haven't tramped that far for sixteen
  years. Most of the sports go by boat. But I can do it if you say so&mdash;I
  guess." Joe walked away in sadness.</p>

  <p>Babbitt had recovered from his touchy wrath before Joe returned. He
  pictured him as warming up and telling the most entertaining stories. But Joe
  had not yet warmed up when they took the trail. He persistently kept behind
  Babbitt, and however much his shoulders ached from the pack, however sorely
  he panted, Babbitt could hear his guide panting equally. But the trail was
  satisfying: a path brown with pine-needles and rough with roots, among the
  balsams, the ferns, the sudden groves of white birch. He became credulous
  again, and rejoiced in sweating. When he stopped to rest he chuckled, "Guess
  we're hitting it up pretty good for a couple o' old birds, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh," admitted Joe.</p>

  <p>"This is a mighty pretty place. Look, you can see the lake down through
  the trees. I tell you, Joe, you don't appreciate how lucky you are to live in
  woods like this, instead of a city with trolleys grinding and typewriters
  clacking and people bothering the life out of you all the time! I wish I knew
  the woods like you do. Say, what's the name of that little red flower?"</p>

  <p>Rubbing his back, Joe regarded the flower resentfully "Well, some folks
  call it one thing and some calls it another I always just call it Pink
  Flower."</p>

  <p>Babbitt blessedly ceased thinking as tramping turned into blind plodding.
  He was submerged in weariness. His plump legs seemed to go on by themselves,
  without guidance, and he mechanically wiped away the sweat which stung his
  eyes. He was too tired to be consciously glad as, after a sun-scourged mile
  of corduroy tote-road through a swamp where flies hovered over a hot waste of
  brush, they reached the cool shore of Box Car Pond. When he lifted the pack
  from his back he staggered from the change in balance, and for a moment could
  not stand erect. He lay beneath an ample-bosomed maple tree near the
  guest-shack, and joyously felt sleep running through his veins.</p>

  <p>He awoke toward dusk, to find Joe efficiently cooking bacon and eggs and
  flapjacks for supper, and his admiration of the woodsman returned. He sat on
  a stump and felt virile.</p>

  <p>"Joe, what would you do if you had a lot of money? Would you stick to
  guiding, or would you take a claim 'way back in the woods and be independent
  of people?"</p>

  <p>For the first time Joe brightened. He chewed his cud a second, and
  bubbled, "I've often thought of that! If I had the money, I'd go down to
  Tinker's Falls and open a swell shoe store."</p>

  <p>After supper Joe proposed a game of stud-poker but Babbitt refused with
  brevity, and Joe contentedly went to bed at eight. Babbitt sat on the stump,
  facing the dark pond, slapping mosquitos. Save the snoring guide, there was
  no other human being within ten miles. He was lonelier than he had ever been
  in his life. Then he was in Zenith.</p>

  <p>He was worrying as to whether Miss McGoun wasn't paying too much for
  carbon paper. He was at once resenting and missing the persistent teasing at
  the Roughnecks' Table. He was wondering what Zilla Riesling was doing now. He
  was wondering whether, after the summer's maturity of being a garageman, Ted
  would "get busy" in the university. He was thinking of his wife. "If she
  would only&mdash;if she wouldn't be so darn satisfied with just settling
  down&mdash;No! I won't! I won't go back! I'll be fifty in three years. Sixty
  in thirteen years. I'm going to have some fun before it's too late. I don't
  care! I will!"</p>

  <p>He thought of Ida Putiak, of Louetta Swanson, of that nice
  widow&mdash;what was her name?&mdash;Tanis Judique?&mdash;the one for whom
  he'd found the flat. He was enmeshed in imaginary conversations. Then:</p>

  <p>"Gee, I can't seem to get away from thinking about folks!"</p>

  <p>Thus it came to him merely to run away was folly, because he could never
  run away from himself.</p>

  <p>That moment he started for Zenith. In his journey there was no appearance
  of flight, but he was fleeing, and four days afterward he was on the Zenith
  train. He knew that he was slinking back not because it was what he longed to
  do but because it was all he could do. He scanned again his discovery that he
  could never run away from Zenith and family and office, because in his own
  brain he bore the office and the family and every street and disquiet and
  illusion of Zenith.</p>

  <p>"But I'm going to&mdash;oh, I'm going to start something!" he vowed, and
  he tried to make it valiant.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">As he walked through the train, looking for familiar faces,
  he saw only one person whom he knew, and that was Seneca Doane, the lawyer
  who, after the blessings of being in Babbitt's own class at college and of
  becoming a corporation-counsel, had turned crank, had headed farmer-labor
  tickets and fraternized with admitted socialists. Though he was in rebellion,
  naturally Babbitt did not care to be seen talking with such a fanatic, but in
  all the Pullmans he could find no other acquaintance, and reluctantly he
  halted. Seneca Doane was a slight, thin-haired man, rather like Chum Frink
  except that he hadn't Frink's grin. He was reading a book called "The Way of
  All Flesh." It looked religious to Babbitt, and he wondered if Doane could
  possibly have been converted and turned decent and patriotic.</p>

  <p>"Why, hello, Doane," he said.</p>

  <p>Doane looked up. His voice was curiously kind. "Oh! How do, Babbitt."</p>

  <p>"Been away, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've been in Washington."</p>

  <p>"Washington, eh? How's the old Government making out?"</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;Won't you sit down?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks. Don't care if I do. Well, well! Been quite a while since I've had
  a good chance to talk to you, Doane. I was, uh&mdash;Sorry you didn't turn up
  at the last class-dinner."</p>

  <p>"Oh-thanks."</p>

  <p>"How's the unions coming? Going to run for mayor again?" Doane seemed
  restless. He was fingering the pages of his book. He said "I might" as though
  it didn't mean anything in particular, and he smiled.</p>

  <p>Babbitt liked that smile, and hunted for conversation: "Saw a bang-up
  cabaret in New York: the 'Good-Morning Cutie' bunch at the Hotel Minton."</p>

  <p>"Yes, they're pretty girls. I danced there one evening."</p>

  <p>"Oh. Like dancing?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally. I like dancing and pretty women and good food better than
  anything else in the world. Most men do."</p>

  <p>"But gosh, Doane, I thought you fellows wanted to take all the good eats
  and everything away from us."</p>

  <p>"No. Not at all. What I'd like to see is the meetings of the Garment
  Workers held at the Ritz, with a dance afterward. Isn't that reasonable?"</p>

  <p>"Yuh, might be good idea, all right. Well&mdash;Shame I haven't seen more
  of you, recent years. Oh, say, hope you haven't held it against me, my
  bucking you as mayor, going on the stump for Prout. You see, I'm an
  organization Republican, and I kind of felt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's no reason why you shouldn't fight me. I have no doubt you're good
  for the Organization. I remember&mdash;in college you were an unusually
  liberal, sensitive chap. I can still recall your saying to me that you were
  going to be a lawyer, and take the cases of the poor for nothing, and fight
  the rich. And I remember I said I was going to be one of the rich myself, and
  buy paintings and live at Newport. I'm sure you inspired us all."</p>

  <p>"Well...Well...I've always aimed to be liberal." Babbitt was enormously
  shy and proud and self-conscious; he tried to look like the boy he had been a
  quarter-century ago, and he shone upon his old friend Seneca Doane as he
  rumbled, "Trouble with a lot of these fellows, even the live wires and some
  of 'em that think they're forward-looking, is they aren't broad-minded and
  liberal. Now, I always believe in giving the other fellow a chance, and
  listening to his ideas."</p>

  <p>"That's fine."</p>

  <p>"Tell you how I figure it: A little opposition is good for all of us, so a
  fellow, especially if he's a business man and engaged in doing the work of
  the world, ought to be liberal."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I always say a fellow ought to have Vision and Ideals. I guess some of
  the fellows in my business think I'm pretty visionary, but I just let 'em
  think what they want to and go right on&mdash;same as you do...By golly, this
  is nice to have a chance to sit and visit and kind of, you might say, brush
  up on our ideals."</p>

  <p>"But of course we visionaries do rather get beaten. Doesn't it bother
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit! Nobody can dictate to me what I think!"</p>

  <p>"You're the man I want to help me. I want you to talk to some of the
  business men and try to make them a little more liberal in their attitude
  toward poor Beecher Ingram."</p>

  <p>"Ingram? But, why, he's this nut preacher that got kicked out of the
  Congregationalist Church, isn't he, and preaches free love and sedition?"</p>

  <p>This, Doane explained, was indeed the general conception of Beecher
  Ingram, but he himself saw Beecher Ingram as a priest of the brotherhood of
  man, of which Babbitt was notoriously an upholder. So would Babbitt keep his
  acquaintances from hounding Ingram and his forlorn little church?</p>

  <p>"You bet! I'll call down any of the boys I hear getting funny about
  Ingram," Babbitt said affectionately to his dear friend Doane.</p>

  <p>Doane warmed up and became reminiscent. He spoke of student days in
  Germany, of lobbying for single tax in Washington, of international labor
  conferences. He mentioned his friends, Lord Wycombe, Colonel Wedgwood,
  Professor Piccoli. Babbitt had always supposed that Doane associated only
  with the I. W. W., but now he nodded gravely, as one who knew Lord Wycombes
  by the score, and he got in two references to Sir Gerald Doak. He felt daring
  and idealistic and cosmopolitan.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, in his new spiritual grandeur, he was sorry for Zilla Riesling,
  and understood her as these ordinary fellows at the Boosters' Club never
  could.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Five hours after he had arrived in Zenith and told his wife
  how hot it was in New York, he went to call on Zilla. He was buzzing with
  ideas and forgiveness. He'd get Paul released; he'd do things, vague but
  highly benevolent things, for Zilla; he'd be as generous as his friend Seneca
  Doane.</p>

  <p>He had not seen Zilla since Paul had shot her, and he still pictured her
  as buxom, high-colored, lively, and a little blowsy. As he drove up to her
  boarding-house, in a depressing back street below the wholesale district, he
  stopped in discomfort. At an upper window, leaning on her elbow, was a woman
  with the features of Zilla, but she was bloodless and aged, like a yellowed
  wad of old paper crumpled into wrinkles. Where Zilla had bounced and jiggled,
  this woman was dreadfully still.</p>

  <p>He waited half an hour before she came into the boarding-house parlor.
  Fifty times he opened the book of photographs of the Chicago World's Fair of
  1893, fifty times he looked at the picture of the Court of Honor.</p>

  <p>He was startled to find Zilla in the room. She wore a black streaky gown
  which she had tried to brighten with a girdle of crimson ribbon. The ribbon
  had been torn and patiently mended. He noted this carefully, because he did
  not wish to look at her shoulders. One shoulder was lower than the other; one
  arm she carried in contorted fashion, as though it were paralyzed; and behind
  a high collar of cheap lace there was a gouge in the anemic neck which had
  once been shining and softly plump.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, old Zilla! By golly, it's good to see you again!"</p>

  <p>"He can send his messages through a lawyer."</p>

  <p>"Why, rats, Zilla, I didn't come just because of him. Came as an old
  friend."</p>

  <p>"You waited long enough!"</p>

  <p>"Well, you know how it is. Figured you wouldn't want to see a friend of
  his for quite some time and&mdash;Sit down, honey! Let's be sensible. We've
  all of us done a bunch of things that we hadn't ought to, but maybe we can
  sort of start over again. Honest, Zilla, I'd like to do something to make you
  both happy. Know what I thought to-day? Mind you, Paul doesn't know a thing
  about this&mdash;doesn't know I was going to come see you. I got to thinking:
  Zilla's a fine? big-hearted woman, and she'll understand that, uh, Paul's had
  his lesson now. Why wouldn't it be a fine idea if you asked the governor to
  pardon him? Believe he would, if it came from you. No! Wait! Just think how
  good you'd feel if you were generous."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I wish to be generous." She was sitting primly, speaking icily. "For
  that reason I wish to keep him in prison, as an example to evil-doers. I've
  gotten religion, George, since the terrible thing that man did to me.
  Sometimes I used to be unkind, and I wished for worldly pleasures, for
  dancing and the theater. But when I was in the hospital the pastor of the
  Pentecostal Communion Faith used to come to see me, and he showed me, right
  from the prophecies written in the Word of God, that the Day of Judgment is
  coming and all the members of the older churches are going straight to
  eternal damnation, because they only do lip-service and swallow the world,
  the flesh, and the devil&mdash;"</p>

  <p>For fifteen wild minutes she talked, pouring out admonitions to flee the
  wrath to come, and her face flushed, her dead voice recaptured something of
  the shrill energy of the old Zilla. She wound up with a furious:</p>

  <p>"It's the blessing of God himself that Paul should be in prison now, and
  torn and humbled by punishment, so that he may yet save his soul, and so
  other wicked men, these horrible chasers after women and lust, may have an
  example."</p>

  <p>Babbitt had itched and twisted. As in church he dared not move during the
  sermon so now he felt that he must seem attentive, though her screeching
  denunciations flew past him like carrion birds.</p>

  <p>He sought to be calm and brotherly:</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know, Zilla. But gosh, it certainly is the essence of religion to
  be charitable, isn't it? Let me tell you how I figure it: What we need in the
  world is liberalism, liberality, if we're going to get anywhere. I've always
  believed in being broad-minded and liberal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You? Liberal?" It was very much the old Zilla. "Why, George Babbitt,
  you're about as broad-minded and liberal as a razor-blade!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am, am I! Well, just let me tell you, just&mdash;let
  me&mdash;tell&mdash;you, I'm as by golly liberal as you are religious,
  anyway! <i>You religious</i>!"</p>

  <p>"I am so! Our pastor says I sustain him in the faith!"</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you do! With Paul's money! But just to show you how liberal I
  am, I'm going to send a check for ten bucks to this Beecher Ingram, because a
  lot of fellows are saying the poor cuss preaches sedition and free love, and
  they're trying to run him out of town."</p>

  <p>"And they're right! They ought to run him out of town! Why, he
  preaches&mdash;if you can call it preaching&mdash;in a theater, in the House
  of Satan! You don't know what it is to find God, to find peace, to behold the
  snares that the devil spreads out for our feet. Oh, I'm so glad to see the
  mysterious purposes of God in having Paul harm me and stop my
  wickedness&mdash;and Paul's getting his, good and plenty, for the cruel
  things he did to me, and I hope he <i>dies</i> in prison!"</p>

  <p>Babbitt was up, hat in hand, growling, "Well, if that's what you call
  being at peace, for heaven's sake just warn me before you go to war, will
  you?"</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Vast is the power of cities to reclaim the wanderer. More
  than mountains or the shore-devouring sea, a city retains its character,
  imperturbable, cynical, holding behind apparent changes its essential
  purpose. Though Babbitt had deserted his family and dwelt with Joe Paradise
  in the wilderness, though he had become a liberal, though he had been quite
  sure, on the night before he reached Zenith, that neither he nor the city
  would be the same again, ten days after his return he could not believe that
  he had ever been away. Nor was it at all evident to his acquaintances that
  there was a new George F. Babbitt, save that he was more irritable under the
  incessant chaffing at the Athletic Club, and once, when Vergil Gunch observed
  that Seneca Doane ought to be hanged, Babbitt snorted, "Oh, rats, he's not so
  bad."</p>

  <p>At home he grunted "Eh?" across the newspaper to his commentatory wife,
  and was delighted by Tinka's new red tam o'shanter, and announced, "No class
  to that corrugated iron garage. Have to build me a nice frame one."</p>

  <p>Verona and Kenneth Escott appeared really to be engaged. In his newspaper
  Escott had conducted a pure-food crusade against commission-houses. As a
  result he had been given an excellent job in a commission-house, and he was
  making a salary on which he could marry, and denouncing irresponsible
  reporters who wrote stories criticizing commission-houses without knowing
  what they were talking about.</p>

  <p>This September Ted had entered the State University as a freshman in the
  College of Arts and Sciences. The university was at Mohalis only fifteen
  miles from Zenith, and Ted often came down for the week-end. Babbitt was
  worried. Ted was "going in for" everything but books. He had tried to "make"
  the football team as a light half-back, he was looking forward to the
  basket-ball season, he was on the committee for the Freshman Hop, and (as a
  Zenithite, an aristocrat among the yokels) he was being "rushed" by two
  fraternities. But of his studies Babbitt could learn nothing save a mumbled,
  "Oh, gosh, these old stiffs of teachers just give you a lot of junk about
  literature and economics."</p>

  <p>One week-end Ted proposed, "Say, Dad, why can't I transfer over from the
  College to the School of Engineering and take mechanical engineering? You
  always holler that I never study, but honest, I would study there."</p>

  <p>"No, the Engineering School hasn't got the standing the College has,"
  fretted Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know how it hasn't! The Engineers can play on any of the
  teams!"</p>

  <p>There was much explanation of the "dollars-and-cents value of being known
  as a college man when you go into the law," and a truly oratorical account of
  the lawyer's life. Before he was through with it, Babbitt had Ted a United
  States Senator.</p>

  <p>Among the great lawyers whom he mentioned was Seneca Doane.</p>

  <p>"But, gee whiz," Ted marveled, "I thought you always said this Doane was a
  reg'lar nut!"</p>

  <p>"That's no way to speak of a great man! Doane's always been a good friend
  of mine&mdash;fact I helped him in college&mdash;I started him out and you
  might say inspired him. Just because he's sympathetic with the aims of Labor,
  a lot of chumps that lack liberality and broad-mindedness think he's a crank,
  but let me tell you there's mighty few of 'em that rake in the fees he does,
  and he's a friend of some of the strongest; most conservative men in the
  world&mdash;like Lord Wycombe, this, uh, this big English nobleman that's so
  well known. And you now, which would you rather do: be in with a lot of
  greasy mechanics and laboring-men, or chum up to a real fellow like Lord
  Wycombe, and get invited to his house for parties?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;gosh," sighed Ted.</p>

  <p>The next week-end he came in joyously with, "Say, Dad, why couldn't I take
  mining engineering instead of the academic course? You talk about
  standing&mdash;maybe there isn't much in mechanical engineering, but the
  Miners, gee, they got seven out of eleven in the new elections to Nu Tau
  Tau!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">The strike which turned Zenith into two belligerent camps;
  white and red, began late in September with a walk-out of telephone girls and
  linemen, in protest against a reduction of wages. The newly formed union of
  dairy-products workers went out, partly in sympathy and partly in demand for
  a forty-four hour week. They were followed by the truck-drivers' union.
  Industry was tied up, and the whole city was nervous with talk of a trolley
  strike, a printers' strike, a general strike. Furious citizens, trying to get
  telephone calls through strike-breaking girls, danced helplessly. Every truck
  that made its way from the factories to the freight-stations was guarded by a
  policeman, trying to look stoical beside the scab driver. A line of fifty
  trucks from the Zenith Steel and Machinery Company was attacked by
  strikers-rushing out from the sidewalk, pulling drivers from the seats,
  smashing carburetors and commutators, while telephone girls cheered from the
  walk, and small boys heaved bricks.</p>

  <p>The National Guard was ordered out. Colonel Nixon, who in private life was
  Mr. Caleb Nixon, secretary of the Pullmore Tractor Company, put on a long
  khaki coat and stalked through crowds, a .44 automatic in hand. Even
  Babbitt's friend, Clarence Drum the shoe merchant&mdash;a round and merry man
  who told stories at the Athletic Club, and who strangely resembled a
  Victorian pug-dog&mdash;was to be seen as a waddling but ferocious captain,
  with his belt tight about his comfortable little belly, and his round little
  mouth petulant as he piped to chattering groups on corners. "Move on there
  now! I can't have any of this loitering!"</p>

  <p>Every newspaper in the city, save one, was against the strikers. When mobs
  raided the news-stands, at each was stationed a militiaman, a young,
  embarrassed citizen-soldier with eye-glasses, bookkeeper or grocery-clerk in
  private life, trying to look dangerous while small boys yelped, "Get onto de
  tin soldier!" and striking truck-drivers inquired tenderly, "Say, Joe, when I
  was fighting in France, was you in camp in the States or was you doing Swede
  exercises in the Y. M. C. A.? Be careful of that bayonet, now, or you'll cut
  yourself!"</p>

  <p>There was no one in Zenith who talked of anything but the strike, and no
  one who did not take sides. You were either a courageous friend of Labor, or
  you were a fearless supporter of the Rights of Property; and in either case
  you were belligerent, and ready to disown any friend who did not hate the
  enemy.</p>

  <p>A condensed-milk plant was set afire&mdash;each side charged it to the
  other&mdash;and the city was hysterical.</p>

  <p>And Babbitt chose this time to be publicly liberal.</p>

  <p>He belonged to the sound, sane, right-thinking wing, and at first he
  agreed that the Crooked Agitators ought to be shot. He was sorry when his
  friend, Seneca Doane, defended arrested strikers, and he thought of going to
  Doane and explaining about these agitators, but when he read a broadside
  alleging that even on their former wages the telephone girls had been hungry,
  he was troubled. "All lies and fake figures," he said, but in a doubtful
  croak.</p>

  <p>For the Sunday after, the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church announced a
  sermon by Dr. John Jennison Drew on "How the Saviour Would End Strikes."
  Babbitt had been negligent about church-going lately, but he went to the
  service, hopeful that Dr. Drew really did have the information as to what the
  divine powers thought about strikes. Beside Babbitt in the large, curving,
  glossy, velvet-upholstered pew was Chum Frink.</p>

  <p>Frink whispered, "Hope the doc gives the strikers hell! Ordinarily, I
  don't believe in a preacher butting into political matters&mdash;let him
  stick to straight religion and save souls, and not stir up a lot of
  discussion&mdash;but at a time like this, I do think he ought to stand right
  up and bawl out those plug-uglies to a fare-you-well!"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;well&mdash;" said Babbitt.</p>

  <p>The Rev. Dr. Drew, his rustic bang flopping with the intensity of his
  poetic and sociologic ardor, trumpeted:</p>

  <p>"During the untoward series of industrial dislocations which
  have&mdash;let us be courageous and admit it boldly&mdash;throttled the
  business life of our fair city these past days, there has been a great deal
  of loose talk about scientific prevention of
  scientific&mdash;<i>scientific</i>! Now, let me tell you that the most
  unscientific thing in the world is science! Take the attacks on the
  established fundamentals of the Christian creed which were so popular with
  the 'scientists' a generation ago. Oh, yes, they were mighty fellows, and
  great poo-bahs of criticism! They were going to destroy the church; they were
  going to prove the world was created and has been brought to its
  extraordinary level of morality and civilization by blind chance. Yet the
  church stands just as firmly to-day as ever, and the only answer a Christian
  pastor needs make to the long-haired opponents of his simple faith is just a
  pitying smile!</p>

  <p>"And now these same 'scientists' want to replace the natural condition of
  free competition by crazy systems which, no matter by what high-sounding
  names they are called, are nothing but a despotic paternalism. Naturally, I'm
  not criticizing labor courts, injunctions against men proven to be striking
  unjustly, or those excellent unions in which the men and the boss get
  together. But I certainly am criticizing the systems in which the free and
  fluid motivation of independent labor is to be replaced by cooked-up
  wage-scales and minimum salaries and government commissions and labor
  federations and all that poppycock.</p>

  <p>"What is not generally understood is that this whole industrial matter
  isn't a question of economics. It's essentially and only a matter of Love,
  and of the practical application of the Christian religion! Imagine a
  factory&mdash;instead of committees of workmen alienating the boss, the boss
  goes among them smiling, and they smile back, the elder brother and the
  younger. Brothers, that's what they must be, loving brothers, and then
  strikes would be as inconceivable as hatred in the home!"</p>

  <p>It was at this point that Babbitt muttered, "Oh, rot!"</p>

  <p>"Huh?" said Chum Frink.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't know what he's talking about. It's just as clear as mud. It
  doesn't mean a darn thing."</p>

  <p>"Maybe, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Frink looked at him doubtfully, through all the service kept glancing at
  him doubtfully, till Babbitt was nervous.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">The strikers had announced a parade for Tuesday morning, but
  Colonel Nixon had forbidden it, the newspapers said. When Babbitt drove west
  from his office at ten that morning he saw a drove of shabby men heading
  toward the tangled, dirty district beyond Court House Square. He hated them,
  because they were poor, because they made him feel insecure "Damn loafers!
  Wouldn't be common workmen if they had any pep," he complained. He wondered
  if there was going to be a riot. He drove toward the starting-point of the
  parade, a triangle of limp and faded grass known as Moore Street Park, and
  halted his car.</p>

  <p>The park and streets were buzzing with strikers, young men in blue denim
  shirts, old men with caps. Through them, keeping them stirred like a boiling
  pot, moved the militiamen. Babbitt could hear the soldiers' monotonous
  orders: "Keep moving&mdash;move on, 'bo&mdash;keep your feet warm!" Babbitt
  admired their stolid good temper. The crowd shouted, "Tin soldiers," and
  "Dirty dogs&mdash;servants of the capitalists!" but the militiamen grinned
  and answered only, "Sure, that's right. Keep moving, Billy!"</p>

  <p>Babbitt thrilled over the citizen-soldiers, hated the scoundrels who were
  obstructing the pleasant ways of prosperity, admired Colonel Nixon's striding
  contempt for the crowd; and as Captain Clarence Drum, that rather puffing
  shoe-dealer, came raging by, Babbitt respectfully clamored, "Great work,
  Captain! Don't let 'em march!" He watched the strikers filing from the park.
  Many of them bore posters with "They can't stop our peacefully walking." The
  militiamen tore away the posters, but the strikers fell in behind their
  leaders and straggled off, a thin unimpressive trickle between steel-glinting
  lines of soldiers. Babbitt saw with disappointment that there wasn't going to
  be any violence, nothing interesting at all. Then he gasped.</p>

  <p>Among the marchers, beside a bulky young workman, was Seneca Doane,
  smiling, content. In front of him was Professor Brockbank, head of the
  history department in the State University, an old man and white-bearded,
  known to come from a distinguished Massachusetts family.</p>

  <p>"Why, gosh," Babbitt marveled, "a swell like him in with the strikers? And
  good ole Senny Doane! They're fools to get mixed up with this bunch. They're
  parlor socialists! But they have got nerve. And nothing in it for them, not a
  cent! And&mdash;I don't know 's <i>all</i> the strikers look like such tough
  nuts. Look just about like anybody else to me!"</p>

  <p>The militiamen were turning the parade down a side street.</p>

  <p>"They got just as much right to march as anybody else! They own the
  streets as much as Clarence Drum or the American Legion does!" Babbitt
  grumbled. "Of course, they're&mdash;they're a bad element, but&mdash;Oh,
  rats!"</p>

  <p>At the Athletic Club, Babbitt was silent during lunch, while the others
  fretted, "I don't know what the world's coming to," or solaced their spirits
  with "kidding."</p>

  <p>Captain Clarence Drum came swinging by, splendid in khaki.</p>

  <p>"How's it going, Captain?" inquired Vergil Gunch.</p>

  <p>"Oh, we got 'em stopped. We worked 'em off on side streets and separated
  'em and they got discouraged and went home."</p>

  <p>"Fine work. No violence."</p>

  <p>"Fine work nothing!" groaned Mr. Drum. "If I had my way, there'd be a
  whole lot of violence, and I'd start it, and then the whole thing would be
  over. I don't believe in standing back and wet-nursing these fellows and
  letting the disturbances drag on. I tell you these strikers are nothing in
  God's world but a lot of bomb-throwing socialists and thugs, and the only way
  to handle 'em is with a club! That's what I'd do; beat up the whole lot of
  'em!"</p>

  <p>Babbitt heard himself saying, "Oh, rats, Clarence, they look just about
  like you and me, and I certainly didn't notice any bombs."</p>

  <p>Drum complained, "Oh, you didn't, eh? Well, maybe you'd like to take
  charge of the strike! Just tell Colonel Nixon what innocents the strikers
  are! He'd be glad to hear about it!" Drum strode on, while all the table
  stared at Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"What's the idea? Do you want us to give those hell-hounds love and
  kisses, or what?" said Orville Jones.</p>

  <p>"Do you defend a lot of hoodlums that are trying to take the bread and
  butter away from our families?" raged Professor Pumphrey.</p>

  <p>Vergil Gunch intimidatingly said nothing. He put on sternness like a mask;
  his jaw was hard, his bristly short hair seemed cruel, his silence was a
  ferocious thunder. While the others assured Babbitt that they must have
  misunderstood him, Gunch looked as though he had understood only too well.
  Like a robed judge he listened to Babbitt's stammering:</p>

  <p>"No, sure; course they're a bunch of toughs. But I just mean&mdash;Strikes
  me it's bad policy to talk about clubbing 'em. Cabe Nixon doesn't. He's got
  the fine Italian hand. And that's why he's colonel. Clarence Drum is jealous
  of him."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Professor Pumphrey, "you hurt Clarence's feelings, George.
  He's been out there all morning getting hot and dusty, and no wonder he wants
  to beat the tar out of those sons of guns!"</p>

  <p>Gunch said nothing, and watched; and Babbitt knew that he was being
  watched.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">As he was leaving the club Babbitt heard Chum Frink
  protesting to Gunch, "&mdash;don't know what's got into him. Last Sunday Doc
  Drew preached a corking sermon about decency in business and Babbitt kicked
  about that, too. Near 's I can figure out&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Babbitt was vaguely frightened.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">He saw a crowd listening to a man who was talking from the
  rostrum of a kitchen-chair. He stopped his car. From newspaper pictures he
  knew that the speaker must be the notorious freelance preacher, Beecher
  Ingram, of whom Seneca Doane had spoken. Ingram was a gaunt man with
  flamboyant hair, weather-beaten cheeks, and worried eyes. He was
  pleading:</p>

  <p>"&mdash;if those telephone girls can hold out, living on one meal a day,
  doing their own washing, starving and smiling, you big hulking men ought to
  be able&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Babbitt saw that from the sidewalk Vergil Gunch was watching him. In vague
  disquiet he started the car and mechanically drove on, while Gunch's hostile
  eyes seemed to follow him all the way.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">"There's a lot of these fellows," Babbitt was complaining to
  his wife, "that think if workmen go on strike they're a regular bunch of
  fiends. Now, of course, it's a fight between sound business and the
  destructive element, and we got to lick the stuffin's out of 'em when they
  challenge us, but doggoned if I see why we can't fight like gentlemen and not
  go calling 'em dirty dogs and saying they ought to be shot down."</p>

  <p>"Why, George," she said placidly, "I thought you always insisted that all
  strikers ought to be put in jail."</p>

  <p>"I never did! Well, I mean&mdash;Some of 'em, of course. Irresponsible
  leaders. But I mean a fellow ought to be broad-minded and liberal about
  things like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But dearie, I thought you always said these so-called 'liberal' people
  were the worst of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rats! Woman never can understand the different definitions of a word.
  Depends on how you mean it. And it don't pay to be too cocksure about
  anything. Now, these strikers: Honest, they're not such bad people. Just
  foolish. They don't understand the complications of merchandizing and profit,
  the way we business men do, but sometimes I think they're about like the rest
  of us, and no more hogs for wages than we are for profits."</p>

  <p>"George! If people were to hear you talk like that&mdash;of course I
  <i>know</i> you; I remember what a wild crazy boy you were; I know you don't
  mean a word you say&mdash;but if people that didn't understand you were to
  hear you talking, they'd think you were a regular socialist!"</p>

  <p>"What do I care what anybody thinks? And let me tell you right now&mdash;I
  want you to distinctly understand I never was a wild crazy kid, and when I
  say a thing, I mean it, and I stand by it and&mdash;Honest, do you think
  people would think I was too liberal if I just said the strikers were
  decent?"</p>

  <p>"Of course they would. But don't worry, dear; I know you don't mean a word
  of it. Time to trot up to bed now. Have you enough covers for to-night?"</p>

  <p>On the sleeping-porch he puzzled, "She doesn't understand me. Hardly
  understand myself. Why can't I take things easy, way I used to?</p>

  <p>"Wish I could go out to Senny Doane's house and talk things over with him.
  No! Suppose Verg Gunch saw me going in there!</p>

  <p>"Wish I knew some really smart woman, and nice, that would see what I'm
  trying to get at, and let me talk to her and&mdash;I wonder if Myra's right?
  Could the fellows think I've gone nutty just because I'm broad-minded and
  liberal? Way Verg looked at me&mdash;"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">Miss Mcgoun came into his private office at three in the
  afternoon with "Lissen, Mr. Babbitt; there's a Mrs. Judique on the
  'phone&mdash;wants to see about some repairs, and the salesmen are all out.
  Want to talk to her?"</p>

  <p>"All right."</p>

  <p>The voice of Tanis Judique was clear and pleasant. The black cylinder of
  the telephone-receiver seemed to hold a tiny animated image of her: lustrous
  eyes, delicate nose, gentle chin.</p>

  <p>"This is Mrs. Judique. Do you remember me? You drove me up here to the
  Cavendish Apartments and helped me find such a nice flat."</p>

  <p>"Sure! Bet I remember! What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"Why, it's just a little&mdash;I don't know that I ought to bother you,
  but the janitor doesn't seem to be able to fix it. You know my flat is on the
  top floor, and with these autumn rains the roof is beginning to leak, and I'd
  be awfully glad if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure! I'll come up and take a look at it." Nervously, "When do you expect
  to be in?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I'm in every morning."</p>

  <p>"Be in this afternoon, in an hour or so?"</p>

  <p>"Ye-es. Perhaps I could give you a cup of tea. I think I ought to, after
  all your trouble."</p>

  <p>"Fine! I'll run up there soon as I can get away."</p>

  <p>He meditated, "Now there's a woman that's got refinement, savvy,
  <i>class</i>! 'After all your trouble&mdash;give you a cup of tea.' She'd
  appreciate a fellow. I'm a fool, but I'm not such a bad cuss, get to know me.
  And not so much a fool as they think!"</p>

  <p>The great strike was over, the strikers beaten. Except that Vergil Gunch
  seemed less cordial, there were no visible effects of Babbitt's treachery to
  the clan. The oppressive fear of criticism was gone, but a diffident
  loneliness remained. Now he was so exhilarated that, to prove he wasn't, he
  droned about the office for fifteen minutes, looking at blue-prints,
  explaining to Miss McGoun that this Mrs. Scott wanted more money for her
  house&mdash;had raised the asking-price&mdash;raised it from seven thousand
  to eighty-five hundred&mdash;would Miss McGoun be sure and put it down on the
  card&mdash;Mrs. Scott's house&mdash;raise. When he had thus established
  himself as a person unemotional and interested only in business, he sauntered
  out. He took a particularly long time to start his car; he kicked the tires,
  dusted the glass of the speedometer, and tightened the screws holding the
  wind-shield spot-light.</p>

  <p>He drove happily off toward the Bellevue district, conscious of the
  presence of Mrs. Judique as of a brilliant light on the horizon. The maple
  leaves had fallen and they lined the gutters of the asphalted streets. It was
  a day of pale gold and faded green, tranquil and lingering. Babbitt was aware
  of the meditative day, and of the barrenness of Bellevue&mdash;blocks of
  wooden houses, garages, little shops, weedy lots. "Needs pepping up; needs
  the touch that people like Mrs. Judique could give a place," he ruminated, as
  he rattled through the long, crude, airy streets. The wind rose, enlivening,
  keen, and in a blaze of well-being he came to the flat of Tanis Judique.</p>

  <p>She was wearing, when she flutteringly admitted him, a frock of black
  chiffon cut modestly round at the base of her pretty throat. She seemed to
  him immensely sophisticated. He glanced at the cretonnes and colored prints
  in her living-room, and gurgled, "Gosh, you've fixed the place nice! Takes a
  clever woman to know how to make a home, all right!"</p>

  <p>"You really like it? I'm so glad! But you've neglected me, scandalously.
  You promised to come some time and learn to dance."</p>

  <p>Rather unsteadily, "Oh, but you didn't mean it seriously!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not. But you might have tried!"</p>

  <p>"Well, here I've come for my lesson, and you might just as well prepare to
  have me stay for supper!"</p>

  <p>They both laughed in a manner which indicated that of course he didn't
  mean it.</p>

  <p>"But first I guess I better look at that leak."</p>

  <p>She climbed with him to the flat roof of the apartment-house a detached
  world of slatted wooden walks, clotheslines, water-tank in a penthouse. He
  poked at things with his toe, and sought to impress her by being learned
  about copper gutters, the desirability of passing plumbing pipes through a
  lead collar and sleeve and flashing them with copper, and the advantages of
  cedar over boiler-iron for roof-tanks.</p>

  <p>"You have to know so much, in real estate!" she admired.</p>

  <p>He promised that the roof should be repaired within two days. "Do you mind
  my 'phoning from your apartment?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Heavens, no!"</p>

  <p>He stood a moment at the coping, looking over a land of hard little
  bungalows with abnormally large porches, and new apartment-houses, small, but
  brave with variegated brick walls and terra-cotta trimmings. Beyond them was
  a hill with a gouge of yellow clay like a vast wound. Behind every
  apartment-house, beside each dwelling, were small garages. It was a world of
  good little people, comfortable, industrious, credulous.</p>

  <p>In the autumnal light the flat newness was mellowed, and the air was a
  sun-tinted pool.</p>

  <p>"Golly, it's one fine afternoon. You get a great view here, right up
  Tanner's Hill," said Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"Yes, isn't it nice and open."</p>

  <p>"So darn few people appreciate a View."</p>

  <p>"Don't you go raising my rent on that account! Oh, that was naughty of me!
  I was just teasing. Seriously though, there are so few who respond&mdash;who
  react to Views. I mean&mdash;they haven't any feeling of poetry and
  beauty."</p>

  <p>"That's a fact, they haven't," he breathed, admiring her slenderness and
  the absorbed, airy way in which she looked toward the hill, chin lifted, lips
  smiling. "Well, guess I'd better telephone the plumbers, so they'll get on
  the job first thing in the morning."</p>

  <p>When he had telephoned, making it conspicuously authoritative and gruff
  and masculine, he looked doubtful, and sighed, "S'pose I'd better
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you must have that cup of tea first!"</p>

  <p>"Well, it would go pretty good, at that."</p>

  <p>It was luxurious to loll in a deep green rep chair, his legs thrust out
  before him, to glance at the black Chinese telephone stand and the colored
  photograph of Mount Vernon which he had always liked so much, while in the
  tiny kitchen&mdash;so near&mdash;Mrs. Judique sang "My Creole Queen." In an
  intolerable sweetness, a contentment so deep that he was wistfully
  discontented, he saw magnolias by moonlight and heard plantation darkies
  crooning to the banjo. He wanted to be near her, on pretense of helping her,
  yet he wanted to remain in this still ecstasy. Languidly he remained.</p>

  <p>When she bustled in with the tea he smiled up at her. "This is awfully
  nice!" For the first time, he was not fencing; he was quietly and securely
  friendly; and friendly and quiet was her answer: "It's nice to have you here.
  You were so kind, helping me to find this little home."</p>

  <p>They agreed that the weather would soon turn cold. They agreed that
  prohibition was prohibitive. They agreed that art in the home was cultural.
  They agreed about everything. They even became bold. They hinted that these
  modern young girls, well, honestly, their short skirts were short. They were
  proud to find that they were not shocked by such frank speaking. Tanis
  ventured, "I know you'll understand&mdash;I mean&mdash;I don't quite know how
  to say it, but I do think that girls who pretend they're bad by the way they
  dress really never go any farther. They give away the fact that they haven't
  the instincts of a womanly woman."</p>

  <p>Remembering Ida Putiak, the manicure girl, and how ill she had used him,
  Babbitt agreed with enthusiasm; remembering how ill all the world had used
  him, he told of Paul Riesling, of Zilla, of Seneca Doane, of the strike:</p>

  <p>"See how it was? Course I was as anxious to have those beggars licked to a
  standstill as anybody else, but gosh, no reason for not seeing their side.
  For a fellow's own sake, he's got to be broad-minded and liberal, don't you
  think so?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I do!" Sitting on the hard little couch, she clasped her hands beside
  her, leaned toward him, absorbed him; and in a glorious state of being
  appreciated he proclaimed:</p>

  <p>"So I up and said to the fellows at the club, 'Look here,' I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you belong to the Union Club? I think it's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No; the Athletic. Tell you: Course they're always asking me to join the
  Union, but I always say, 'No, sir! Nothing doing!' I don't mind the expense
  but I can't stand all the old fogies."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, that's so. But tell me: what did you say to them?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you don't want to hear it. I'm probably boring you to death with my
  troubles! You wouldn't hardly think I was an old duffer; I sound like a
  kid!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're a boy yet. I mean&mdash;you can't be a day over
  forty-five."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not&mdash;much. But by golly I begin to feel middle-aged
  sometimes; all these responsibilities and all."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know!" Her voice caressed him; it cloaked him like warm silk. "And
  I feel lonely, so lonely, some days, Mr. Babbitt."</p>

  <p>"We're a sad pair of birds! But I think we're pretty darn nice!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think we're lots nicer than most people I know!" They smiled. "But
  please tell me what you said at the Club."</p>

  <p>"Well, it was like this: Course Seneca Doane is a friend of
  mine&mdash;they can say what they want to, they can call him anything they
  please, but what most folks here don't know is that Senny is the bosom pal of
  some of the biggest statesmen in the world&mdash;Lord Wycombe,
  frinstance&mdash;you know, this big British nobleman. My friend Sir Gerald
  Doak told me that Lord Wycombe is one of the biggest guns in
  England&mdash;well, Doak or somebody told me."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Do you know Sir Gerald? The one that was here, at the
  McKelveys'?"</p>

  <p>"Know him? Well, say, I know him just well enough so we call each other
  George and Jerry, and we got so pickled together in Chicago&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That must have been fun. But&mdash;" She shook a finger at him. "&mdash;I
  can't have you getting pickled! I'll have to take you in hand!"</p>

  <p>"Wish you would!...Well, zize saying: You see I happen to know what a big
  noise Senny Doane is outside of Zenith, but of course a prophet hasn't got
  any honor in his own country, and Senny, darn his old hide, he's so blame
  modest that he never lets folks know the kind of an outfit he travels with
  when he goes abroad. Well, during the strike Clarence Drum comes pee-rading
  up to our table, all dolled up fit to kill in his nice lil cap'n's uniform,
  and somebody says to him, 'Busting the strike, Clarence?'</p>

  <p>"Well, he swells up like a pouter-pigeon and he hollers, so 's you could
  hear him way up in the reading-room, 'Yes, sure; I told the strike-leaders
  where they got off, and so they went home.'</p>

  <p>"'Well,' I says to him, 'glad there wasn't any violence.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' he says, 'but if I hadn't kept my eye skinned there would 've
  been. All those fellows had bombs in their pockets. They're reg'lar
  anarchists.'</p>

  <p>"'Oh, rats, Clarence,' I says, 'I looked 'em all over carefully, and they
  didn't have any more bombs 'n a rabbit,' I says. 'Course,' I says, 'they're
  foolish, but they're a good deal like you and me, after all.'</p>

  <p>"And then Vergil Gunch or somebody&mdash;no, it was Chum Frink&mdash;you
  know, this famous poet&mdash;great pal of mine&mdash;he says to me, 'Look
  here,' he says, 'do you mean to say you advocate these strikes?' Well, I was
  so disgusted with a fellow whose mind worked that way that I swear, I had a
  good mind to not explain at all&mdash;just ignore him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's so wise!" said Mrs. Judique.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;but finally I explains to him: 'If you'd done as much as I have on
  Chamber of Commerce committees and all,' I says, 'then you'd have the right
  to talk! But same time,' I says, 'I believe in treating your opponent like a
  gentleman!' Well, sir, that held 'em! Frink&mdash;Chum I always call
  him&mdash;he didn't have another word to say. But at that, I guess some of
  'em kind o' thought I was too liberal. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you were so wise. And courageous! I love a man to have the courage of
  his convictions!"</p>

  <p>"But do you think it was a good stunt? After all, some of these fellows
  are so darn cautious and narrow-minded that they're prejudiced against a
  fellow that talks right out in meeting."</p>

  <p>"What do you care? In the long run they're bound to respect a man who
  makes them think, and with your reputation for oratory you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do you know about my reputation for oratory?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm not going to tell you everything I know! But seriously, you don't
  realize what a famous man you are."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;Though I haven't done much orating this fall. Too kind of
  bothered by this Paul Riesling business, I guess. But&mdash;Do you know,
  you're the first person that's really understood what I was getting at,
  Tanis&mdash;Listen to me, will you! Fat nerve I've got, calling you
  Tanis!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, do! And shall I call you George? Don't you think it's awfully nice
  when two people have so much&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;so much
  analysis that they can discard all these stupid conventions and understand
  each other and become acquainted right away, like ships that pass in the
  night?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly do! I certainly do!"</p>

  <p>He was no longer quiescent in his chair; he wandered about the room, he
  dropped on the couch beside her. But as he awkwardly stretched his hand
  toward her fragile, immaculate fingers, she said brightly, "Do give me a
  cigarette. Would you think poor Tanis was dreadfully naughty if she
  smoked?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, no! I like it!"</p>

  <p>He had often and weightily pondered flappers smoking in Zenith
  restaurants, but he knew only one woman who smoked&mdash;Mrs. Sam Doppelbrau,
  his flighty neighbor. He ceremoniously lighted Tanis's cigarette, looked for
  a place to deposit the burnt match, and dropped it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you want a cigar, you poor man!" she crooned.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind one?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! I love the smell of a good cigar; so nice and&mdash;so nice and
  like a man. You'll find an ash-tray in my bedroom, on the table beside the
  bed, if you don't mind getting it."</p>

  <p>He was embarrassed by her bedroom: the broad couch with a cover of violet
  silk, mauve curtains striped with gold. Chinese Chippendale bureau, and an
  amazing row of slippers, with ribbon-wound shoe-trees, and primrose stockings
  lying across them. His manner of bringing the ash-tray had just the right
  note of easy friendliness, he felt. "A boob like Verg Gunch would try to get
  funny about seeing her bedroom, but I take it casually." He was not casual
  afterward. The contentment of companionship was gone, and he was restless
  with desire to touch her hand. But whenever he turned toward her, the
  cigarette was in his way. It was a shield between them. He waited till she
  should have finished, but as he rejoiced at her quick crushing of its light
  on the ashtray she said, "Don't you want to give me another cigarette?" and
  hopelessly he saw the screen of pale smoke and her graceful tilted hand again
  between them. He was not merely curious now to find out whether she would let
  him hold her hand (all in the purest friendship, naturally), but agonized
  with need of it.</p>

  <p>On the surface appeared none of all this fretful drama. They were talking
  cheerfully of motors, of trips to California, of Chum Frink. Once he said
  delicately, "I do hate these guys&mdash;I hate these people that invite
  themselves to meals, but I seem to have a feeling I'm going to have supper
  with the lovely Mrs. Tanis Judique to-night. But I suppose you probably have
  seven dates already."</p>

  <p>"Well, I was thinking some of going to the movies. Yes, I really think I
  ought to get out and get some fresh air."</p>

  <p>She did not encourage him to stay, but never did she discourage him. He
  considered, "I better take a sneak! She <i>will</i> let me stay&mdash;there
  <i>is</i> something doing&mdash;and I mustn't get mixed up with&mdash;I
  mustn't&mdash;I've got to beat it." Then, "No. it's too late now."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, at seven, brushing her cigarette away, brusquely taking her
  hand:</p>

  <p>"Tanis! Stop teasing me! You know we&mdash;Here we are, a couple of lonely
  birds, and we're awful happy together. Anyway I am! Never been so happy! Do
  let me stay! Ill gallop down to the delicatessen and buy some
  stuff&mdash;cold chicken maybe&mdash;or cold turkey&mdash;and we can have a
  nice little supper, and afterwards, if you want to chase me out, I'll be good
  and go like a lamb."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;yes&mdash;it would be nice," she said.</p>

  <p>Nor did she withdraw her hand. He squeezed it, trembling, and blundered
  toward his coat. At the delicatessen he bought preposterous stores of food,
  chosen on the principle of expensiveness. From the drug store across the
  street he telephoned to his wife, "Got to get a fellow to sign a lease before
  he leaves town on the midnight. Won't be home till late. Don't wait up for
  me. Kiss Tinka good-night." He expectantly lumbered back to the flat.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you bad thing, to buy so much food!" was her greeting, and her voice
  was gay, her smile acceptant.</p>

  <p>He helped her in the tiny white kitchen; he washed the lettuce, he opened
  the olive bottle. She ordered him to set the table, and as he trotted into
  the living-room, as he hunted through the buffet for knives and forks, he
  felt utterly at home.</p>

  <p>"Now the only other thing," he announced, "is what you're going to wear. I
  can't decide whether you're to put on your swellest evening gown, or let your
  hair down and put on short skirts and make-believe you're a little girl."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to dine just as I am, in this old chiffon rag, and if you can't
  stand poor Tanis that way, you can go to the club for dinner!"</p>

  <p>"Stand you!" He patted her shoulder. "Child, you're the brainiest and the
  loveliest and finest woman I've ever met! Come now, Lady Wycombe, if you'll
  take the Duke of Zenith's arm, we will proambulate in to the magnolious
  feed!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you do say the funniest, nicest things!"</p>

  <p>When they had finished the picnic supper he thrust his head out of the
  window and reported, "It's turned awful chilly, and I think it's going to
  rain. You don't want to go to the movies."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wish we had a fireplace! I wish it was raining like all get-out
  to-night, and we were in a funny little old-fashioned cottage, and the trees
  thrashing like everything outside, and a great big log fire and&mdash;I'll
  tell you! Let's draw this couch up to the radiator, and stretch our feet out,
  and pretend it's a wood-fire."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I think that's pathetic! You big child!"</p>

  <p>But they did draw up to the radiator, and propped their feet against
  it&mdash;his clumsy black shoes, her patent-leather slippers. In the dimness
  they talked of themselves; of how lonely she was, how bewildered he, and how
  wonderful that they had found each other. As they fell silent the room was
  stiller than a country lane. There was no sound from the street save the whir
  of motor-tires, the rumble of a distant freight-train. Self-contained was the
  room, warm, secure, insulated from the harassing world.</p>

  <p>He was absorbed by a rapture in which all fear and doubting were smoothed
  away; and when he reached home, at dawn, the rapture had mellowed to
  contentment serene and full of memories.</p>

     name="ch29">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">The assurance of Tanis Judique's friendship fortified
  Babbitt's self-approval. At the Athletic Club he became experimental. Though
  Vergil Gunch was silent, the others at the Roughnecks' Table came to accept
  Babbitt as having, for no visible reason, "turned crank." They argued windily
  with him, and he was cocky, and enjoyed the spectacle of his interesting
  martyrdom. He even praised Seneca Doane. Professor Pumphrey said that was
  carrying a joke too far; but Babbitt argued, "No! Fact! I tell you he's got
  one of the keenest intellects in the country. Why, Lord Wycombe said
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, who the hell is Lord Wycombe? What you always lugging him in for? You
  been touting him for the last six weeks!" protested Orville Jones.</p>

  <p>"George ordered him from Sears-Roebuck. You can get those English
  high-muckamucks by mail for two bucks apiece," suggested Sidney
  Finkelstein.</p>

  <p>"That's all right now! Lord Wycombe, he's one of the biggest intellects in
  English political life. As I was saying: Of course I'm conservative myself,
  but I appreciate a guy like Senny Doane because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Vergil Gunch interrupted harshly, "I wonder if you are so conservative? I
  find I can manage to run my own business without any skunks and reds like
  Doane in it!"</p>

  <p>The grimness of Gunch's voice, the hardness of his jaw, disconcerted
  Babbitt, but he recovered and went on till they looked bored, then irritated,
  then as doubtful as Gunch.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">He thought of Tanis always. With a stir he remembered her
  every aspect. His arms yearned for her. "I've found her! I've dreamed of her
  all these years and now I've found her!" he exulted. He met her at the movies
  in the morning; he drove out to her flat in the late afternoon or on evenings
  when he was believed to be at the Elks. He knew her financial affairs and
  advised her about them, while she lamented her feminine ignorance, and
  praised his masterfulness, and proved to know much more about bonds than he
  did. They had remembrances, and laughter over old times. Once they quarreled,
  and he raged that she was as "bossy" as his wife and far more whining when he
  was inattentive. But that passed safely.</p>

  <p>Their high hour was a tramp on a ringing December afternoon, through
  snow-drifted meadows down to the icy Chaloosa River. She was exotic in an
  astrachan cap and a short beaver coat; she slid on the ice and shouted, and
  he panted after her, rotund with laughter...Myra Babbitt never slid on the
  ice.</p>

  <p>He was afraid that they would be seen together. In Zenith it is impossible
  to lunch with a neighbor's wife without the fact being known, before
  nightfall, in every house in your circle. But Tanis was beautifully discreet.
  However appealingly she might turn to him when they were alone, she was
  gravely detached when they were abroad, and he hoped that she would be taken
  for a client. Orville Jones once saw them emerging from a movie theater, and
  Babbitt bumbled, "Let me make you 'quainted with Mrs. Judique. Now here's a
  lady who knows the right broker to come to, Orvy!" Mr. Jones, though he was a
  man censorious of morals and of laundry machinery, seemed satisfied.</p>

  <p>His predominant fear&mdash;not from any especial fondness for her but from
  the habit of propriety&mdash;was that his wife would learn of the affair. He
  was certain that she knew nothing specific about Tanis, but he was also
  certain that she suspected something indefinite. For years she had been bored
  by anything more affectionate than a farewell kiss, yet she was hurt by any
  slackening in his irritable periodic interest, and now he had no interest;
  rather, a revulsion. He was completely faithful&mdash;to Tanis. He was
  distressed by the sight of his wife's slack plumpness, by her puffs and
  billows of flesh, by the tattered petticoat which she was always meaning and
  always forgetting to throw away. But he was aware that she, so long attuned
  to him, caught all his repulsions. He elaborately, heavily, jocularly tried
  to check them. He couldn't.</p>

  <p>They had a tolerable Christmas. Kenneth Escott was there, admittedly
  engaged to Verona. Mrs. Babbitt was tearful and called Kenneth her new son.
  Babbitt was worried about Ted, because he had ceased complaining of the State
  University and become suspiciously acquiescent. He wondered what the boy was
  planning, and was too shy to ask. Himself, Babbitt slipped away on Christmas
  afternoon to take his present, a silver cigarette-box, to Tanis. When he
  returned Mrs. Babbitt asked, much too innocently, "Did you go out for a
  little fresh air?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, just lil drive," he mumbled.</p>

  <p>After New Year's his wife proposed, "I heard from my sister to-day,
  George. She isn't well. I think perhaps I ought to go stay with her for a few
  weeks."</p>

  <p>Now, Mrs. Babbitt was not accustomed to leave home during the winter
  except on violently demanding occasions, and only the summer before, she had
  been gone for weeks. Nor was Babbitt one of the detachable husbands who take
  separations casually He liked to have her there; she looked after his
  clothes; she knew how his steak ought to be cooked; and her clucking made him
  feel secure. But he could not drum up even a dutiful "Oh, she doesn't really
  need you, does she?" While he tried to look regretful, while he felt that his
  wife was watching him, he was filled with exultant visions of Tanis.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'd better go?" she said sharply.</p>

  <p>"You've got to decide, honey; I can't."</p>

  <p>She turned away, sighing, and his forehead was damp.</p>

  <p>Till she went, four days later, she was curiously still, he cumbrously
  affectionate. Her train left at noon. As he saw it grow small beyond the
  train-shed he longed to hurry to Tanis.</p>

  <p>"No, by golly, I won't do that!" he vowed. "I won't go near her for a
  week!"</p>

  <p>But he was at her flat at four.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">He who had once controlled or seemed to control his life in
  a progress unimpassioned but diligent and sane was for that fortnight borne
  on a current of desire and very bad whisky and all the complications of new
  acquaintances, those furious new intimates who demand so much more attention
  than old friends. Each morning he gloomily recognized his idiocies of the
  evening before. With his head throbbing, his tongue and lips stinging from
  cigarettes, he incredulously counted the number of drinks he had taken, and
  groaned, "I got to quit!" He had ceased saying, "I <i>will</i> quit!" for
  however resolute he might be at dawn, he could not, for a single evening,
  check his drift.</p>

  <p>He had met Tanis's friends; he had, with the ardent haste of the Midnight
  People, who drink and dance and rattle and are ever afraid to be silent, been
  adopted as a member of her group, which they called "The Bunch." He first met
  them after a day when he had worked particularly hard and when he hoped to be
  quiet with Tanis and slowly sip her admiration.</p>

  <p>From down the hall he could hear shrieks and the grind of a phonograph. As
  Tanis opened the door he saw fantastic figures dancing in a haze of cigarette
  smoke. The tables and chairs were against the wall.</p>

  <p>"Oh, isn't this dandy!" she gabbled at him. "Carrie Nork had the loveliest
  idea. She decided it was time for a party, and she 'phoned the Bunch and told
  'em to gather round...George, this is Carrie."</p>

  <p>"Carrie" was, in the less desirable aspects of both, at once matronly and
  spinsterish. She was perhaps forty; her hair was an unconvincing ash-blond;
  and if her chest was flat, her hips were ponderous. She greeted Babbitt with
  a giggling "Welcome to our little midst! Tanis says you're a real sport."</p>

  <p>He was apparently expected to dance, to be boyish and gay with Carrie, and
  he did his unforgiving best. He towed her about the room, bumping into other
  couples, into the radiator, into chair-legs cunningly ambushed. As he danced
  he surveyed the rest of the Bunch: A thin young woman who looked capable,
  conceited, and sarcastic. Another woman whom he could never quite remember.
  Three overdressed and slightly effeminate young men&mdash;soda-fountain
  clerks, or at least born for that profession. A man of his own age,
  immovable, self-satisfied, resentful of Babbitt's presence.</p>

  <p>When he had finished his dutiful dance Tanis took him aside and begged,
  "Dear, wouldn't you like to do something for me? I'm all out of booze, and
  the Bunch want to celebrate. Couldn't you just skip down to Healey Hanson's
  and get some?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," he said, trying not to sound sullen.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you: I'll get Minnie Sonntag to drive down with you." Tanis was
  pointing to the thin, sarcastic young woman.</p>

  <p>Miss Sonntag greeted him with an astringent "How d'you do, Mr. Babbitt.
  Tanis tells me you're a very prominent man, and I'm honored by being allowed
  to drive with you. Of course I'm not accustomed to associating with society
  people like you, so I don't know how to act in such exalted circles!"</p>

  <p>Thus Miss Sonntag talked all the way down to Healey Hanson's. To her jibes
  he wanted to reply "Oh, go to the devil!" but he never quite nerved himself
  to that reasonable comment. He was resenting the existence of the whole
  Bunch. He had heard Tanis speak of "darling Carrie" and "Min
  Sonntag&mdash;she's so clever&mdash;you'll adore her," but they had never
  been real to him. He had pictured Tanis as living in a rose-tinted vacuum,
  waiting for him, free of all the complications of a Floral Heights.</p>

  <p>When they returned he had to endure the patronage of the young
  soda-clerks. They were as damply friendly as Miss Sonntag was dryly hostile.
  They called him "Old Georgie" and shouted, "Come on now, sport; shake a
  leg"...boys in belted coats, pimply boys, as young as Ted and as flabby as
  chorus-men, but powerful to dance and to mind the phonograph and smoke
  cigarettes and patronize Tanis. He tried to be one of them; he cried "Good
  work, Pete!" but his voice creaked.</p>

  <p>Tanis apparently enjoyed the companionship of the dancing darlings; she
  bridled to their bland flirtation and casually kissed them at the end of each
  dance. Babbitt hated her, for the moment. He saw her as middle-aged. He
  studied the wrinkles in the softness of her throat, the slack flesh beneath
  her chin. The taut muscles of her youth were loose and drooping. Between
  dances she sat in the largest chair, waving her cigarette, summoning her
  callow admirers to come and talk to her. ("She thinks she's a blooming
  queen!" growled Babbitt.) She chanted to Miss Sonntag, "Isn't my little
  studio sweet?" ("Studio, rats! It's a plain old-maid-and-chow-dog flat! Oh,
  God, I wish I was home! I wonder if I can't make a getaway now?")</p>

  <p>His vision grew blurred, however, as he applied himself to Healey Hanson's
  raw but vigorous whisky. He blended with the Bunch. He began to rejoice that
  Carrie Nork and Pete, the most nearly intelligent of the nimble youths,
  seemed to like him; and it was enormously important to win over the surly
  older man, who proved to be a railway clerk named Fulton Bemis.</p>

  <p>The conversation of the Bunch was exclamatory, high-colored, full of
  references to people whom Babbitt did not know. Apparently they thought very
  comfortably of themselves. They were the Bunch, wise and beautiful and
  amusing; they were Bohemians and urbanites, accustomed to all the luxuries of
  Zenith: dance-halls, movie-theaters, and roadhouses; and in a cynical
  superiority to people who were "slow" or "tightwad" they cackled:</p>

  <p>"Oh, Pete, did I tell you what that dub of a cashier said when I came in
  late yesterday? Oh, it was per-fect-ly priceless!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, but wasn't T. D. stewed! Say, he was simply ossified! What did Gladys
  say to him?"</p>

  <p>"Think of the nerve of Bob Bickerstaff trying to get us to come to his
  house! Say, the nerve of him! Can you beat it for nerve? Some nerve I call
  it!"</p>

  <p>"Did you notice how Dotty was dancing? Gee, wasn't she the limit!"</p>

  <p>Babbitt was to be heard sonorously agreeing with the once-hated Miss
  Minnie Sonntag that persons who let a night go by without dancing to jazz
  music were crabs, pikers, and poor fish; and he roared "You bet!" when Mrs.
  Carrie Nork gurgled, "Don't you love to sit on the floor? It's so Bohemian!"
  He began to think extremely well of the Bunch. When he mentioned his friends
  Sir Gerald Doak, Lord Wycombe, William Washington Eathorne, and Chum Frink,
  he was proud of their condescending interest. He got so thoroughly into the
  jocund spirit that he didn't much mind seeing Tanis drooping against the
  shoulder of the youngest and milkiest of the young men, and he himself
  desired to hold Carrie Nork's pulpy hand, and dropped it only because Tanis
  looked angry.</p>

  <p>When he went home, at two, he was fully a member of the Bunch, and all the
  week thereafter he was bound by the exceedingly straitened conventions, the
  exceedingly wearing demands, of their life of pleasure and freedom. He had to
  go to their parties; he was involved in the agitation when everybody
  telephoned to everybody else that she hadn't meant what she'd said when she'd
  said that, and anyway, why was Pete going around saying she'd said it?</p>

  <p>Never was a Family more insistent on learning one another's movements than
  were the Bunch. All of them volubly knew, or indignantly desired to know,
  where all the others had been every minute of the week. Babbitt found himself
  explaining to Carrie or Fulton Bemis just what he had been doing that he
  should not have joined them till ten o'clock, and apologizing for having gone
  to dinner with a business acquaintance.</p>

  <p>Every member of the Bunch was expected to telephone to every other member
  at least once a week. "Why haven't you called me up?" Babbitt was asked
  accusingly, not only by Tanis and Carrie but presently by new ancient
  friends, Jennie and Capitolina and Toots.</p>

  <p>If for a moment he had seen Tanis as withering and sentimental, he lost
  that impression at Carrie Nork's dance. Mrs. Nork had a large house and a
  small husband. To her party came all of the Bunch, perhaps thirty-five of
  them when they were completely mobilized. Babbitt, under the name of "Old
  Georgie," was now a pioneer of the Bunch, since each month it changed half
  its membership and he who could recall the prehistoric days of a fortnight
  ago, before Mrs. Absolom, the food-demonstrator, had gone to Indianapolis,
  and Mac had "got sore at" Minnie, was a venerable leader and able to
  condescend to new Petes and Minnies and Gladyses.</p>

  <p>At Carrie's, Tanis did not have to work at being hostess. She was
  dignified and sure, a clear fine figure in the black chiffon frock he had
  always loved; and in the wider spaces of that ugly house Babbitt was able to
  sit quietly with her. He repented of his first revulsion, mooned at her feet,
  and happily drove her home. Next day he bought a violent yellow tie, to make
  himself young for her. He knew, a little sadly, that he could not make
  himself beautiful; he beheld himself as heavy, hinting of fatness, but he
  danced, he dressed, he chattered, to be as young as she was...as young as she
  seemed to be.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">As all converts, whether to a religion, love, or gardening,
  find as by magic that though hitherto these hobbies have not seemed to exist,
  now the whole world is filled with their fury, so, once he was converted to
  dissipation, Babbitt discovered agreeable opportunities for it
  everywhere.</p>

  <p>He had a new view of his sporting neighbor, Sam Doppelbrau. The
  Doppelbraus were respectable people, industrious people, prosperous people,
  whose ideal of happiness was an eternal cabaret. Their life was dominated by
  suburban bacchanalia of alcohol, nicotine, gasoline, and kisses. They and
  their set worked capably all the week, and all week looked forward to
  Saturday night, when they would, as they expressed it, "throw a party;" and
  the thrown party grew noisier and noisier up to Sunday dawn, and usually
  included an extremely rapid motor expedition to nowhere in particular.</p>

  <p>One evening when Tanis was at the theater, Babbitt found himself being
  lively with the Doppelbraus, pledging friendship with men whom he had for
  years privily denounced to Mrs. Babbitt as a "rotten bunch of tin-horns that
  I wouldn't go out with, rot if they were the last people on earth." That
  evening he had sulkily come home and poked about in front of the house,
  chipping off the walk the ice-clots, like fossil footprints, made by the
  steps of passers-by during the recent snow. Howard Littlefield came up
  snuffling.</p>

  <p>"Still a widower, George?"</p>

  <p>"Yump. Cold again to-night."</p>

  <p>"What do you hear from the wife?"</p>

  <p>"She's feeling fine, but her sister is still pretty sick."</p>

  <p>"Say, better come in and have dinner with us to-night, George."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;oh, thanks. Have to go out."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he could not endure Littlefield's recitals of the more
  interesting statistics about totally uninteresting problems. He scraped at
  the walk and grunted.</p>

  <p>Sam Doppelbrau appeared.</p>

  <p>"Evenin', Babbitt. Working hard?"</p>

  <p>"Yuh, lil exercise."</p>

  <p>"Cold enough for you to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Well, just about."</p>

  <p>"Still a widower?"</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh."</p>

  <p>"Say, Babbitt, while she's away&mdash;I know you don't care much for
  booze-fights, but the Missus and I'd be awfully glad if you could come in
  some night. Think you could stand a good cocktail for once?"</p>

  <p>"Stand it? Young fella, I bet old Uncle George can mix the best cocktail
  in these United States!"</p>

  <p>"Hurray! That's the way to talk! Look here: There's some folks coming to
  the house to-night, Louetta Swanson and some other live ones, and I'm going
  to open up a bottle of pre-war gin, and maybe we'll dance a while. Why don't
  you drop in and jazz it up a little, just for a change?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;What time they coming?"</p>

  <p>He was at Sam Doppelbrau's at nine. It was the third time he had entered
  the house. By ten he was calling Mr. Doppelbrau "Sam, old hoss."</p>

  <p>At eleven they all drove out to the Old Farm Inn. Babbitt sat in the back
  of Doppelbrau's car with Louetta Swanson. Once he had timorously tried to
  make love to her. Now he did not try; he merely made love; and Louetta
  dropped her head on his shoulder, told him what a nagger Eddie was, and
  accepted Babbitt as a decent and well-trained libertine.</p>

  <p>With the assistance of Tanis's Bunch, the Doppelbraus, and other
  companions in forgetfulness, there was not an evening for two weeks when he
  did not return home late and shaky. With his other faculties blurred he yet
  had the motorist's gift of being able to drive when he could scarce walk; of
  slowing down at corners and allowing for approaching cars. He came wambling
  into the house. If Verona and Kenneth Escott were about, he got past them
  with a hasty greeting, horribly aware of their level young glances, and hid
  himself up-stairs. He found when he came into the warm house that he was
  hazier than he had believed. His head whirled. He dared not lie down. He
  tried to soak out the alcohol in a hot bath. For the moment his head was
  clearer but when he moved about the bathroom his calculations of distance
  were wrong, so that he dragged down the towels, and knocked over the
  soap-dish with a clatter which, he feared, would betray him to the children.
  Chilly in his dressing-gown he tried to read the evening paper. He could
  follow every word; he seemed to take in the sense of things; but a minute
  afterward he could not have told what he had been reading. When he went to
  bed his brain flew in circles, and he hastily sat up, struggling for
  self-control. At last he was able to lie still, feeling only a little sick
  and dizzy&mdash;and enormously ashamed. To hide his "condition" from his own
  children! To have danced and shouted with people whom he despised! To have
  said foolish things, sung idiotic songs, tried to kiss silly girls!
  Incredulously he remembered that he had by his roaring familiarity with them
  laid himself open to the patronizing of youths whom he would have kicked out
  of his office; that by dancing too ardently he had exposed himself to rebukes
  from the rattiest of withering women. As it came relentlessly back to him he
  snarled, "I hate myself! God how I hate myself!" But, he raged, "I'm through!
  No more! Had enough, plenty!"</p>

  <p>He was even surer about it the morning after, when he was trying to be
  grave and paternal with his daughters at breakfast. At noontime he was less
  sure. He did not deny that he had been a fool; he saw it almost as clearly as
  at midnight; but anything, he struggled, was better than going back to a life
  of barren heartiness. At four he wanted a drink. He kept a whisky flask in
  his desk now, and after two minutes of battle he had his drink. Three drinks
  later he began to see the Bunch as tender and amusing friends, and by six he
  was with them...and the tale was to be told all over.</p>

  <p>Each morning his head ached a little less. A bad head for drinks had been
  his safeguard, but the safeguard was crumbling. Presently he could be drunk
  at dawn, yet not feel particularly wretched in his conscience&mdash;or in his
  stomach&mdash;when he awoke at eight. No regret, no desire to escape the toil
  of keeping up with the arduous merriment of the Bunch, was so great as his
  feeling of social inferiority when he failed to keep up. To be the "livest"
  of them was as much his ambition now as it had been to excel at making money,
  at playing golf, at motor-driving, at oratory, at climbing to the McKelvey
  set. But occasionally he failed.</p>

  <p>He found that Pete and the other young men considered the Bunch too
  austerely polite and the Carrie who merely kissed behind doors too
  embarrassingly monogamic. As Babbitt sneaked from Floral Heights down to the
  Bunch, so the young gallants sneaked from the proprieties of the Bunch off to
  "times" with bouncing young women whom they picked up in department stores
  and at hotel coatrooms. Once Babbitt tried to accompany them. There was a
  motor car, a bottle of whisky, and for him a grubby shrieking cash-girl from
  Parcher and Stein's. He sat beside her and worried. He was apparently
  expected to "jolly her along," but when she sang out, "Hey, leggo, quit
  crushing me cootie-garage," he did not quite know how to go on. They sat in
  the back room of a saloon, and Babbitt had a headache, was confused by their
  new slang looked at them benevolently, wanted to go home, and had a
  drink&mdash;a good many drinks.</p>

  <p>Two evenings after, Fulton Bemis, the surly older man of the Bunch, took
  Babbitt aside and grunted, "Look here, it's none of my business, and God
  knows I always lap up my share of the hootch, but don't you think you better
  watch yourself? You're one of these enthusiastic chumps that always overdo
  things. D' you realize you're throwing in the booze as fast as you can, and
  you eat one cigarette right after another? Better cut it out for a
  while."</p>

  <p>Babbitt tearfully said that good old Fult was a prince, and yes, he
  certainly would cut it out, and thereafter he lighted a cigarette and took a
  drink and had a terrific quarrel with Tanis when she caught him being
  affectionate with Carrie Nork.</p>

  <p>Next morning he hated himself that he should have sunk into a position
  where a fifteenth-rater like Fulton Bemis could rebuke him. He perceived
  that, since he was making love to every woman possible, Tanis was no longer
  his one pure star, and he wondered whether she had ever been anything more to
  him than A Woman. And if Bemis had spoken to him, were other people talking
  about him? He suspiciously watched the men at the Athletic Club that noon. It
  seemed to him that they were uneasy. They had been talking about him then? He
  was angry. He became belligerent. He not only defended Seneca Doane but even
  made fun of the Y. M. C. A, Vergil Gunch was rather brief in his answers.</p>

  <p>Afterward Babbitt was not angry. He was afraid. He did not go to the next
  lunch of the Boosters' Club but hid in a cheap restaurant, and, while he
  munched a ham-and-egg sandwich and sipped coffee from a cup on the arm of his
  chair, he worried.</p>

  <p>Four days later, when the Bunch were having one of their best parties,
  Babbitt drove them to the skating-rink which had been laid out on the
  Chaloosa River. After a thaw the streets had frozen in smooth ice. Down those
  wide endless streets the wind rattled between the rows of wooden houses, and
  the whole Bellevue district seemed a frontier town. Even with skid chains on
  all four wheels, Babbitt was afraid of sliding, and when he came to the long
  slide of a hill he crawled down, both brakes on. Slewing round a corner came
  a less cautious car. It skidded, it almost raked them with its rear fenders.
  In relief at their escape the Bunch&mdash;Tanis, Minnie Sonntag, Pete, Fulton
  Bemis&mdash;shouted "Oh, baby," and waved their hands to the agitated other
  driver. Then Babbitt saw Professor Pumphrey laboriously crawling up hill,
  afoot, Staring owlishly at the revelers. He was sure that Pumphrey recognized
  him and saw Tanis kiss him as she crowed, "You're such a good driver!"</p>

  <p>At lunch next day he probed Pumphrey with "Out last night with my brother
  and some friends of his. Gosh, what driving! Slippery 's glass. Thought I saw
  you hiking up the Bellevue Avenue Hill."</p>

  <p>"No, I wasn't&mdash;I didn't see you," said Pumphrey, hastily, rather
  guiltily.</p>

  <p>Perhaps two days afterward Babbitt took Tanis to lunch at the Hotel
  Thornleigh. She who had seemed well content to wait for him at her flat had
  begun to hint with melancholy smiles that he must think but little of her if
  he never introduced her to his friends, if he was unwilling to be seen with
  her except at the movies. He thought of taking her to the "ladies' annex" of
  the Athletic Club, but that was too dangerous. He would have to introduce her
  and, oh, people might misunderstand and&mdash;He compromised on the
  Thornleigh.</p>

  <p>She was unusually smart, all in black: small black tricorne hat, short
  black caracul coat, loose and swinging, and austere high-necked black velvet
  frock at a time when most street costumes were like evening gowns. Perhaps
  she was too smart. Every one in the gold and oak restaurant of the Thornleigh
  was staring at her as Babbitt followed her to a table. He uneasily hoped that
  the head-waiter would give them a discreet place behind a pillar, but they
  were stationed on the center aisle. Tanis seemed not to notice her admirers;
  she smiled at Babbitt with a lavish "Oh, isn't this nice! What a
  peppy-looking orchestra!" Babbitt had difficulty in being lavish in return,
  for two tables away he saw Vergil Gunch. All through the meal Gunch watched
  them, while Babbitt watched himself being watched and lugubriously tried to
  keep from spoiling Tanis's gaiety. "I felt like a spree to-day," she rippled.
  "I love the Thornleigh, don't you? It's so live and yet so&mdash;so
  refined."</p>

  <p>He made talk about the Thornleigh, the service, the food, the people he
  recognized in the restaurant, all but Vergil Gunch. There did not seem to be
  anything else to talk of. He smiled conscientiously at her fluttering jests;
  he agreed with her that Minnie Sonntag was "so hard to get along with," and
  young Pete "such a silly lazy kid, really just no good at all." But he
  himself had nothing to say. He considered telling her his worries about
  Gunch, but&mdash;"oh, gosh, it was too much work to go into the whole thing
  and explain about Verg and everything."</p>

  <p>He was relieved when he put Tanis on a trolley; he was cheerful in the
  familiar simplicities of his office.</p>

  <p>At four o'clock Vergil Gunch called on him.</p>

  <p>Babbitt was agitated, but Gunch began in a friendly way:</p>

  <p>"How's the boy? Say, some of us are getting up a scheme we'd kind of like
  to have you come in on."</p>

  <p>"Fine, Verg. Shoot."</p>

  <p>"You know during the war we had the Undesirable Element, the Reds and
  walking delegates and just the plain common grouches, dead to rights, and so
  did we for quite a while after the war, but folks forget about the danger and
  that gives these cranks a chance to begin working underground again,
  especially a lot of these parlor socialists. Well, it's up to the folks that
  do a little sound thinking to make a conscious effort to keep bucking these
  fellows. Some guy back East has organized a society called the Good Citizens'
  League for just that purpose. Of course the Chamber of Commerce and the
  American Legion and so on do a fine work in keeping the decent people in the
  saddle, but they're devoted to so many other causes that they can't attend to
  this one problem properly. But the Good Citizens' League, the G. C. L., they
  stick right to it. Oh, the G. C. L. has to have some other ostensible
  purposes&mdash;frinstance here in Zenith I think it ought to support the
  park-extension project and the City Planning Committee&mdash;and then, too,
  it should have a social aspect, being made up of the best people&mdash;have
  dances and so on, especially as one of the best ways it can put the kibosh on
  cranks is to apply this social boycott business to folks big enough so you
  can't reach 'em otherwise. Then if that don't work, the G. C. L. can finally
  send a little delegation around to inform folks that get too flip that they
  got to conform to decent standards and quit shooting off their mouths so
  free. Don't it sound like the organization could do a great work? We've
  already got some of the strongest men in town, and of course we want you in.
  How about it?"</p>

  <p>Babbitt was uncomfortable. He felt a compulsion back to all the standards
  he had so vaguely yet so desperately been fleeing. He fumbled:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'd especially light on fellows like Seneca Doane and try to
  make 'em&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You bet your sweet life we would! Look here, old Georgie: I've never for
  one moment believed you meant it when you've defended Doane, and the strikers
  and so on, at the Club. I knew you were simply kidding those poor galoots
  like Sid Finkelstein...At least I certainly hope you were kidding!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well&mdash;sure&mdash;Course you might say&mdash;" Babbitt was
  conscious of how feeble he sounded, conscious of Gunch's mature and
  relentless eye. "Gosh, you know where I stand! I'm no labor agitator! I'm a
  business man, first, last, and all the time! But&mdash;but honestly, I don't
  think Doane means so badly, and you got to remember he's an old friend of
  mine."</p>

  <p>"George, when it comes right down to a struggle between decency and the
  security of our homes on the one hand, and red ruin and those lazy dogs
  plotting for free beer on the other, you got to give up even old friendships.
  'He that is not with me is against me.'"</p>

  <p>"Ye-es, I suppose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How about it? Going to join us in the Good Citizens' League?"</p>

  <p>"I'll have to think it over, Verg."</p>

  <p>"All right, just as you say." Babbitt was relieved to be let off so
  easily, but Gunch went on: "George, I don't know what's come over you; none
  of us do; and we've talked a lot about you. For a while we figured out you'd
  been upset by what happened to poor Riesling, and we forgave you for any fool
  thing you said, but that's old stuff now, George, and we can't make out
  what's got into you. Personally, I've always defended you, but I must say
  it's getting too much for me. All the boys at the Athletic Club and the
  Boosters' are sore, the way you go on deliberately touting Doane and his
  bunch of hell-hounds, and talking about being liberal&mdash;which means being
  wishy-washy&mdash;and even saying this preacher guy Ingram isn't a
  professional free-love artist. And then the way you been carrying on
  personally! Joe Pumphrey says he saw you out the other night with a gang of
  totties, all stewed to the gills, and here to-day coming right into the
  Thornleigh with a&mdash;well, she may be all right and a perfect lady, but
  she certainly did look like a pretty gay skirt for a fellow with his wife out
  of town to be taking to lunch. Didn't look well. What the devil has come over
  you, George?"</p>

  <p>"Strikes me there's a lot of fellows that know more about my personal
  business than I do myself!"</p>

  <p>"Now don't go getting sore at me because I come out flatfooted like a
  friend and say what I think instead of tattling behind your back, the way a
  whole lot of 'em do. I tell you George, you got a position in the community,
  and the community expects you to live up to it. And&mdash;Better think over
  joining the Good Citizens' League. See you about it later."</p>

  <p>He was gone.</p>

  <p>That evening Babbitt dined alone. He saw all the Clan of Good Fellows
  peering through the restaurant window, spying on him. Fear sat beside him,
  and he told himself that to-night he would not go to Tanis's flat; and he did
  not go...till late.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">The summer before, Mrs. Babbitt's letters had crackled with
  desire to return to Zenith. Now they said nothing of returning, but a wistful
  "I suppose everything is going on all right without me" among her dry
  chronicles of weather and sicknesses hinted to Babbitt that he hadn't been
  very urgent about her coming. He worried it:</p>

  <p>"If she were here, and I went on raising cain like I been doing, she'd
  have a fit. I got to get hold of myself. I got to learn to play around and
  yet not make a fool of myself. I can do it, too, if folks like Verg Gunch 'll
  let me alone, and Myra 'll stay away. But&mdash;poor kid, she sounds lonely.
  Lord, I don't want to hurt her!"</p>

  <p>Impulsively he wrote that they missed her, and her next letter said
  happily that she was coming home.</p>

  <p>He persuaded himself that he was eager to see her. He bought roses for the
  house, he ordered squab for dinner, he had the car cleaned and polished. All
  the way home from the station with her he was adequate in his accounts of
  Ted's success in basket-ball at the university, but before they reached
  Floral Heights there was nothing more to say, and already he felt the force
  of her stolidity, wondered whether he could remain a good husband and still
  sneak out of the house this evening for half an hour with the Bunch. When he
  had housed the car he blundered upstairs, into the familiar talcum-scented
  warmth of her presence, blaring, "Help you unpack your bag?"</p>

  <p>"No, I can do it."</p>

  <p>Slowly she turned, holding up a small box, and slowly she said, "I brought
  you a present, just a new cigar-case. I don't know if you'd care to have
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was the lonely girl, the brown appealing Myra Thompson, whom he had
  married, and he almost wept for pity as he kissed her and besought, "Oh,
  honey, honey, <i>care</i> to have it? Of course I do! I'm awful proud you
  brought it to me. And I needed a new case badly."</p>

  <p>He wondered how he would get rid of the case he had bought the week
  before.</p>

  <p>"And you really are glad to see me back?"</p>

  <p>"Why, you poor kiddy, what you been worrying about?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you didn't seem to miss me very much."</p>

  <p>By the time he had finished his stint of lying they were firmly bound
  again. By ten that evening it seemed improbable that she had ever been away.
  There was but one difference: the problem of remaining a respectable husband,
  a Floral Heights husband, yet seeing Tanis and the Bunch with frequency. He
  had promised to telephone to Tanis that evening, and now it was
  melodramatically impossible. He prowled about the telephone, impulsively
  thrusting out a hand to lift the receiver, but never quite daring to risk it.
  Nor could he find a reason for slipping down to the drug store on Smith
  Street, with its telephone-booth. He was laden with responsibility till he
  threw it off with the speculation: "Why the deuce should I fret so about not
  being able to 'phone Tanis? She can get along without me. I don't owe her
  anything. She's a fine girl, but I've given her just as much as she has
  me...Oh, damn these women and the way they get you all tied up in
  complications!"</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">For a week he was attentive to his wife, took her to the
  theater, to dinner at the Littlefields'; then the old weary dodging and
  shifting began and at least two evenings a week he spent with the Bunch. He
  still made pretense of going to the Elks and to committee-meetings but less
  and less did he trouble to have his excuses interesting, less and less did
  she affect to believe them. He was certain that she knew he was associating
  with what Floral Heights called "a sporty crowd," yet neither of them
  acknowledged it. In matrimonial geography the distance between the first mute
  recognition of a break and the admission thereof is as great as the distance
  between the first naive faith and the first doubting.</p>

  <p>As he began to drift away he also began to see her as a human being, to
  like and dislike her instead of accepting her as a comparatively movable part
  of the furniture, and he compassionated that husband-and-wife relation which,
  in twenty-five years of married life, had become a separate and real entity.
  He recalled their high lights the summer vacation in Virginia meadows under
  the blue wall of the mountains; their motor tour through Ohio, and the
  exploration of Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus; the birth of Verona;
  their building of this new house, planned to comfort them through a happy old
  age&mdash;chokingly they had said that it might be the last home either of
  them would ever have. Yet his most softening remembrance of these dear
  moments did not keep him from barking at dinner, "Yep, going out f' few
  hours. Don't sit up for me."</p>

  <p>He did not dare now to come home drunk, and though he rejoiced in his
  return to high morality and spoke with gravity to Pete and Fulton Bemis about
  their drinking, he prickled at Myra's unexpressed criticisms and sulkily
  meditated that a "fellow couldn't ever learn to handle himself if he was
  always bossed by a lot of women."</p>

  <p>He no longer wondered if Tanis wasn't a bit worn and sentimental. In
  contrast to the complacent Myra he saw her as swift and air-borne and
  radiant, a fire-spirit tenderly stooping to the hearth, and however pitifully
  he brooded on his wife, he longed to be with Tanis.</p>

  <p>Then Mrs. Babbitt tore the decent cloak from her unhappiness and the
  astounded male discovered that she was having a small determined rebellion of
  her own.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">They were beside the fireless fire-place, in the
  evening.</p>

  <p>"Georgie," she said, "you haven't given me the list of your household
  expenses while I was away."</p>

  <p>"No, I&mdash;Haven't made it out yet." Very affably: "Gosh, we must try to
  keep down expenses this year."</p>

  <p>"That's so. I don't know where all the money goes to. I try to economize,
  but it just seems to evaporate."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I oughtn't to spend so much on cigars. Don't know but what I'll
  cut down my smoking, maybe cut it out entirely. I was thinking of a good way
  to do it, the other day: start on these cubeb cigarettes, and they'd kind of
  disgust me with smoking."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I do wish you would! It isn't that I care, but honestly, George, it
  is so bad for you to smoke so much. Don't you think you could reduce the
  amount? And George&mdash;I notice now, when you come home from these lodges
  and all, that sometimes you smell of whisky. Dearie, you know I don't worry
  so much about the moral side of it, but you have a weak stomach and you can't
  stand all this drinking."</p>

  <p>"Weak stomach, hell! I guess I can carry my booze about as well as most
  folks!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I do think you ought to be careful. Don't you see, dear, I don't
  want you to get sick."</p>

  <p>"Sick rats! I'm not a baby! I guess I ain't going to get sick just because
  maybe once a week I shoot a highball! That's the trouble with women. They
  always exaggerate so."</p>

  <p>"George, I don't think you ought to talk that way when I'm just speaking
  for your own good."</p>

  <p>"I know, but gosh all fishhooks, that's the trouble with women! They're
  always criticizing and commenting and bringing things up, and then they say
  it's 'for your own good'!"</p>

  <p>"Why, George, that's not a nice way to talk, to answer me so short."</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't mean to answer short, but gosh, talking as if I was a
  kindergarten brat, not able to tote one highball without calling for the St.
  Mary's ambulance! A fine idea you must have of me!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it isn't that; it's just&mdash;I don't want to see you get sick
  and&mdash;My, I didn't know it was so late! Don't forget to give me those
  household accounts for the time while I was away."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thunder, what's the use of taking the trouble to make 'em out now?
  Let's just skip 'em for that period."</p>

  <p>"Why, George Babbitt, in all the years we've been married we've never
  failed to keep a complete account of every penny we've spent!"</p>

  <p>"No. Maybe that's the trouble with us."</p>

  <p>"What in the world do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't mean anything, only&mdash;Sometimes I get so darn sick and
  tired of all this routine and the accounting at the office and expenses at
  home and fussing and stewing and fretting and wearing myself out worrying
  over a lot of junk that doesn't really mean a doggone thing, and being so
  careful and&mdash;Good Lord, what do you think I'm made for? I could have
  been a darn good orator, and here I fuss and fret and worry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't you suppose I ever get tired of fussing? I get so bored with
  ordering three meals a day, three hundred and sixty-five days a year, and
  ruining my eyes over that horrid sewing-machine, and looking after your
  clothes and Rone's and Ted's and Tinka's and everybody's, and the laundry,
  and darning socks, and going down to the Piggly Wiggly to market, and
  bringing my basket home to save money on the cash-and-carry
  and&mdash;<i>everything</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Well, gosh," with a certain astonishment, "I suppose maybe you do! But
  talk about&mdash;Here I have to be in the office every single day, while you
  can go out all afternoon and see folks and visit with the neighbors and do
  any blinkin' thing you want to!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and a fine lot of good that does me! Just talking over the same old
  things with the same old crowd, while you have all sorts of interesting
  people coming in to see you at the office."</p>

  <p>"Interesting! Cranky old dames that want to know why I haven't rented
  their dear precious homes for about seven times their value, and bunch of old
  crabs panning the everlasting daylights out of me because they don't receive
  every cent of their rentals by three G.M. on the second of the month! Sure!
  Interesting! Just as interesting as the small pox!"</p>

  <p>"Now, George, I will not have you shouting at me that way!"</p>

  <p>"Well, it gets my goat the way women figure out that a man doesn't do a
  darn thing but sit on his chair and have lovey-dovey conferences with a lot
  of classy dames and give 'em the glad eye!"</p>

  <p>"I guess you manage to give them a glad enough eye when they do come
  in."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Mean I'm chasing flappers?"</p>

  <p>"I should hope not&mdash;at your age!"</p>

  <p>"Now you look here! You may not believe it&mdash;Of course all you see is
  fat little Georgie Babbitt. Sure! Handy man around the house! Fixes the
  furnace when the furnace-man doesn't show up, and pays the bills, but dull,
  awful dull! Well, you may not believe it, but there's some women that think
  old George Babbitt isn't such a bad scout! They think he's not so
  bad-looking, not so bad that it hurts anyway, and he's got a pretty good line
  of guff, and some even think he shakes a darn wicked Walkover at
  dancing!"</p>

  <p>"Yes." She spoke slowly. "I haven't much doubt that when I'm away you
  manage to find people who properly appreciate you."</p>

  <p>"Well, I just mean&mdash;" he protested, with a sound of denial. Then he
  was angered into semi-honesty. "You bet I do! I find plenty of folks, and
  doggone nice ones, that don't think I'm a weak-stomached baby!"</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what I was saying! You can run around with anybody you
  please, but I'm supposed to sit here and wait for you. You have the chance to
  get all sorts of culture and everything, and I just stay home&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, gosh almighty, there's nothing to prevent your reading books and
  going to lectures and all that junk, is there?"</p>

  <p>"George, I told you, I won't have you shouting at me like that! I don't
  know what's come over you. You never used to speak to me in this cranky
  way."</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean to sound cranky, but gosh, it certainly makes me sore to
  get the blame because you don't keep up with things."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to! Will you help me?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Anything I can do to help you in the culture-grabbing
  line&mdash;yours to oblige, G. F. Babbitt."</p>

  <p>"Very well then, I want you to go to Mrs. Mudge's New Thought meeting with
  me, next Sunday afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Who's which?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Opal Emerson Mudge. The field-lecturer for the American New Thought
  League. She's going to speak on 'Cultivating the Sun Spirit' before the
  League of the Higher Illumination, at the Thornleigh."</p>

  <p>"Oh, punk! New Thought! Hashed thought with a poached egg! 'Cultivating
  the&mdash;' It sounds like 'Why is a mouse when it spins?' That's a fine
  spiel for a good Presbyterian to be going to, when you can hear Doc
  Drew!"</p>

  <p>"Reverend Drew is a scholar and a pulpit orator and all that, but he
  hasn't got the Inner Ferment, as Mrs. Mudge calls it; he hasn't any
  inspiration for the New Era. Women need inspiration now. So I want you to
  come, as you promised."</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">The Zenith branch of the League of the Higher Illumination
  met in the smaller ballroom at the Hotel Thornleigh, a refined apartment with
  pale green walls and plaster wreaths of roses, refined parquet flooring, and
  ultra-refined frail gilt chairs. Here were gathered sixty-five women and ten
  men. Most of the men slouched in their chairs and wriggled, while their wives
  sat rigidly at attention, but two of them&mdash;red-necked, meaty
  men&mdash;were as respectably devout as their wives. They were newly rich
  contractors who, having bought houses, motors, hand-painted pictures, and
  gentlemanliness, were now buying a refined ready-made philosophy. It had been
  a toss-up with them whether to buy New Thought, Christian Science, or a good
  standard high-church model of Episcopalianism.</p>

  <p>In the flesh, Mrs. Opal Emerson Mudge fell somewhat short of a prophetic
  aspect. She was pony-built and plump, with the face of a haughty Pekingese, a
  button of a nose, and arms so short that, despite her most indignant
  endeavors, she could not clasp her hands in front of her as she sat on the
  platform waiting. Her frock of taffeta and green velvet, with three strings
  of glass beads, and large folding eye-glasses dangling from a black ribbon,
  was a triumph of refinement.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mudge was introduced by the president of the League of the Higher
  Illumination, an oldish young woman with a yearning voice, white spats, and a
  mustache. She said that Mrs. Mudge would now make it plain to the simplest
  intellect how the Sun Spirit could be cultivated, and they who had been
  thinking about cultivating one would do well to treasure Mrs. Mudge's words,
  because even Zenith (and everybody knew that Zenith stood in the van of
  spiritual and New Thought progress) didn't often have the opportunity to sit
  at the feet of such an inspiring Optimist and Metaphysical Seer as Mrs. Opal
  Emerson Mudge, who had lived the Life of Wider Usefulness through
  Concentration, and in the Silence found those Secrets of Mental Control and
  the Inner Key which were immediately going to transform and bring Peace,
  Power, and Prosperity to the unhappy nations; and so, friends, would they for
  this precious gem-studded hour forget the Illusions of the Seeming Real, and
  in the actualization of the deep-lying Veritas pass, along with Mrs. Opal
  Emerson Mudge, to the Realm Beautiful.</p>

  <p>If Mrs. Mudge was rather pudgier than one would like one's swamis, yogis,
  seers, and initiates, yet her voice had the real professional note. It was
  refined and optimistic; it was overpoweringly calm; it flowed on
  relentlessly, without one comma, till Babbitt was hypnotized. Her favorite
  word was "always," which she pronounced olllllle-ways. Her principal gesture
  was a pontifical but thoroughly ladylike blessing with two stubby
  fingers.</p>

  <p>She explained about this matter of Spiritual Saturation:</p>

  <p>"There are those&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Of "those" she made a linked sweetness long drawn out; a far-off delicate
  call in a twilight minor. It chastely rebuked the restless husbands, yet
  brought them a message of healing.</p>

  <p>"There are those who have seen the rim and outer seeming of the logos
  there are those who have glimpsed and in enthusiasm possessed themselves of
  some segment and portion of the Logos there are those who thus flicked but

  assertative that they possess and are possessed of the Logos and the
  Metaphysikos but this word I bring you this concept I enlarge that those that
  are not utter are not even inceptive and that holiness is in its definitive
  essence always always always whole-iness and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It proved that the Essence of the Sun Spirit was Truth, but its Aura and
  Effluxion were Cheerfulness:</p>

  <p>"Face always the day with the dawn-laugh with the enthusiasm of the
  initiate who perceives that all works together in the revolutions of the
  Wheel and who answers the strictures of the Soured Souls of the
  Destructionists with a Glad Affirmation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It went on for about an hour and seven minutes.</p>

  <p>At the end Mrs. Mudge spoke with more vigor and punctuation:</p>

  <p>"Now let me suggest to all of you the advantages of the Theosophical and
  Pantheistic Oriental Reading Circle, which I represent. Our object is to
  unite all the manifestations of the New Era into one cohesive whole&mdash;New
  Thought, Christian Science, Theosophy, Vedanta, Bahaism, and the other sparks
  from the one New Light. The subscription is but ten dollars a year, and for
  this mere pittance the members receive not only the monthly magazine, Pearls
  of Healing, but the privilege of sending right to the president, our revered
  Mother Dobbs, any questions regarding spiritual progress, matrimonial
  problems, health and well-being questions, financial difficulties,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They listened to her with adoring attention. They looked genteel. They
  looked ironed-out. They coughed politely, and crossed their legs with
  quietness, and in expensive linen handkerchiefs they blew their noses with a
  delicacy altogether optimistic and refined.</p>

  <p>As for Babbitt, he sat and suffered.</p>

  <p>When they were blessedly out in the air again, when they drove home
  through a wind smelling of snow and honest sun, he dared not speak. They had
  been too near to quarreling, these days. Mrs. Babbitt forced it:</p>

  <p>"Did you enjoy Mrs. Mudge's talk?"</p>

  <p>"Well I&mdash;What did you get out of it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it starts a person thinking. It gets you out of a routine of ordinary
  thoughts."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll hand it to Opal she isn't ordinary, but gosh&mdash;Honest, did
  that stuff mean anything to you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm not trained in metaphysics, and there was lots I couldn't
  quite grasp, but I did feel it was inspiring. And she speaks so readily. I do
  think you ought to have got something out of it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't! I swear, I was simply astonished, the way those women
  lapped it up! Why the dickens they want to put in their time listening to all
  that blaa when they&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's certainly better for them than going to roadhouses and smoking and
  drinking!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether it is or not! Personally I don't see a whole lot of
  difference. In both cases they're trying to get away from
  themselves&mdash;most everybody is, these days, I guess. And I'd certainly
  get a whole lot more out of hoofing it in a good lively dance, even in some
  dive, than sitting looking as if my collar was too tight, and feeling too
  scared to spit, and listening to Opal chewing her words."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you do! You're very fond of dives. No doubt you saw a lot of
  them while I was away!"</p>

  <p>"Look here! You been doing a hell of a lot of insinuating and hinting
  around lately, as if I were leading a double life or something, and I'm damn
  sick of it, and I don't want to hear anything more about it!"</p>

  <p>"Why, George Babbitt! Do you realize what you're saying? Why, George, in
  all our years together you've never talked to me like that!"</p>

  <p>"It's about time then!"</p>

  <p>"Lately you've been getting worse and worse, and now, finally, you're
  cursing and swearing at me and shouting at me, and your voice so ugly and
  hateful&mdash;I just shudder!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, rats, quit exaggerating! I wasn't shouting, or swearing either."</p>

  <p>"I wish you could hear your own voice! Maybe you don't realize how it
  sounds. But even so&mdash;You never used to talk like that. You simply
  <i>couldn't</i> talk this way if something dreadful hadn't happened to
  you."</p>

  <p>His mind was hard. With amazement he found that he wasn't particularly
  sorry. It was only with an effort that he made himself more agreeable: "Well,
  gosh, I didn't mean to get sore."</p>

  <p>"George, do you realize that we can't go on like this, getting farther and
  farther apart, and you ruder and ruder to me? I just don't know what's going
  to happen."</p>

  <p>He had a moment's pity for her bewilderment; he thought of how many deep
  and tender things would be hurt if they really "couldn't go on like this."
  But his pity was impersonal, and he was wondering, "Wouldn't it maybe be a
  good thing if&mdash;Not a divorce and all that, o' course, but kind of a
  little more independence?"</p>

  <p>While she looked at him pleadingly he drove on in a dreadful silence.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch31"

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">When he was away from her, while he kicked about the garage
  and swept the snow off the running-board and examined a cracked
  hose-connection, he repented, he was alarmed and astonished that he could
  have flared out at his wife, and thought fondly how much more lasting she was
  than the flighty Bunch. He went in to mumble that he was "sorry, didn't mean
  to be grouchy," and to inquire as to her interest in movies. But in the
  darkness of the movie theater he brooded that he'd "gone and tied himself up
  to Myra all over again." He had some satisfaction in taking it out on Tanis
  Judique. "Hang Tanis anyway! Why'd she gone and got him into these mix-ups
  and made him all jumpy and nervous and cranky? Too many complications! Cut
  'em out!"</p>

  <p>He wanted peace. For ten days he did not see Tanis nor telephone to her,
  and instantly she put upon him the compulsion which he hated. When he had
  stayed away from her for five days, hourly taking pride in his resoluteness
  and hourly picturing how greatly Tanis must miss him, Miss McGoun reported,
  "Mrs. Judique on the 'phone. Like t' speak t' you 'bout some repairs."</p>

  <p>Tanis was quick and quiet:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Babbitt? Oh, George, this is Tanis. I haven't seen you for
  weeks&mdash;days, anyway. You aren't sick, are you?"</p>

  <p>"No, just been terribly rushed. I, uh, I think there'll be a big revival
  of building this year. Got to, uh, got to work hard."</p>

  <p>"Of course, my man! I want you to. You know I'm terribly ambitious for
  you; much more than I am for myself. I just don't want you to forget poor
  Tanis. Will you call me up soon?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! Sure! You bet!"</p>

  <p>"Please do. I sha'n't call you again."</p>

  <p>He meditated, "Poor kid!...But gosh, she oughtn't to 'phone me at the
  office...She's a wonder&mdash;sympathy 'ambitious for me.'...But gosh, I
  won't be made and compelled to call her up till I get ready. Darn these
  women, the way they make demands! It'll be one long old time before I see
  her!...But gosh, I'd like to see her to-night&mdash;sweet little thing...Oh,
  cut that, son! Now you've broken away, be wise!"</p>

  <p>She did not telephone again, nor he, but after five more days she wrote to
  him:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Have I offended you? You must know, dear, I didn't mean to.
  I'm so lonely and I need somebody to cheer me up. Why didn't you come to the
  nice party we had at Carrie's last evening I remember she invited you. Can't
  you come around here to-morrow Thur evening? I shall be alone and hope to see
  you.</p>

  <p><br>
  His reflections were numerous:</p>

  <p>"Doggone it, why can't she let me alone? Why can't women ever learn a
  fellow hates to be bulldozed? And they always take advantage of you by
  yelling how lonely they are.</p>

  <p>"Now that isn't nice of you, young fella. She's a fine, square, straight
  girl, and she does get lonely. She writes a swell hand. Nice-looking
  stationery. Plain. Refined. I guess I'll have to go see her. Well, thank God,
  I got till to-morrow night free of her, anyway.</p>

  <p>"She's nice but&mdash;Hang it, I won't be <i>made</i> to do things! I'm
  not married to her. No, nor by golly going to be!</p>

  <p>"Oh, rats, I suppose I better go see her."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Thursday, the to-morrow of Tanis's note, was full of
  emotional crises. At the Roughnecks' Table at the club, Verg Gunch talked of
  the Good Citizens' League and (it seemed to Babbitt) deliberately left him
  out of the invitations to join. Old Mat Penniman, the general utility man at
  Babbitt's office, had Troubles, and came in to groan about them: his oldest
  boy was "no good," his wife was sick, and he had quarreled with his
  brother-in-law. Conrad Lyte also had Troubles, and since Lyte was one of his
  best clients, Babbitt had to listen to them. Mr. Lyte, it appeared, was
  suffering from a peculiarly interesting neuralgia, and the garage had
  overcharged him. When Babbitt came home, everybody had Troubles: his wife was
  simultaneously thinking about discharging the impudent new maid, and worried
  lest the maid leave; and Tinka desired to denounce her teacher.</p>

  <p>"Oh, quit fussing!" Babbitt fussed. "You never hear me whining about my
  Troubles, and yet if you had to run a real-estate office&mdash;Why, to-day I
  found Miss Bannigan was two days behind with her accounts, and I pinched my
  finger in my desk, and Lyte was in and just as unreasonable as ever."</p>

  <p>He was so vexed that after dinner, when it was time for a tactful escape
  to Tanis, he merely grumped to his wife, "Got to go out. Be back by eleven,
  should think."</p>

  <p>"Oh! You're going out again?"</p>

  <p>"Again! What do you mean 'again'! Haven't hardly been out of the house for
  a week!"</p>

  <p>"Are you&mdash;are you going to the Elks?"</p>

  <p>"Nope. Got to see some people."</p>

  <p>Though this time he heard his own voice and knew that it was curt, though
  she was looking at him with wide-eyed reproach, he stumped into the hall,
  jerked on his ulster and furlined gloves, and went out to start the car.</p>

  <p>He was relieved to find Tanis cheerful, unreproachful, and brilliant in a
  frock of brown net over gold tissue. "You poor man, having to come out on a
  night like this! It's terribly cold. Don't you think a small highball would
  be nice?"</p>

  <p>"Now, by golly, there's a woman with savvy! I think we could more or less
  stand a highball if it wasn't too long a one&mdash;not over a foot tall!"</p>

  <p>He kissed her with careless heartiness, he forgot the compulsion of her
  demands, he stretched in a large chair and felt that he had beautifully come
  home. He was suddenly loquacious; he told her what a noble and misunderstood
  man he was, and how superior to Pete, Fulton Bemis, and the other men of
  their acquaintance; and she, bending forward, chin in charming hand, brightly
  agreed. But when he forced himself to ask, "Well, honey, how's things with
  <i>you</i>," she took his duty-question seriously, and he discovered that she
  too had Troubles:</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right but&mdash;I did get so angry with Carrie. She told Minnie
  that I told her that Minnie was an awful tightwad, and Minnie told me Carrie
  had told her, and of course I told her I hadn't said anything of the kind,
  and then Carrie found Minnie had told me, and she was simply furious because
  Minnie had told me, and of course I was just boiling because Carrie had told
  her I'd told her, and then we all met up at Fulton's&mdash;his wife is
  away&mdash;thank heavens!&mdash;oh, there's the dandiest floor in his house
  to dance on&mdash;and we were all of us simply furious at each other
  and&mdash;Oh, I do hate that kind of a mix-up, don't you? I mean&mdash;it's
  so lacking in refinement, but&mdash;And Mother wants to come and stay with me
  for a whole month, and of course I do love her, I suppose I do, but honestly,
  she'll cramp my style something dreadful&mdash;she never can learn not to
  comment, and she always wants to know where I'm going when I go out evenings,
  and if I lie to her she always spies around and ferrets around and finds out
  where I've been, and then she looks like Patience on a Monument till I could
  just scream. And oh, I <i>must</i> tell you&mdash;You know I never talk about
  myself; I just hate people who do, don't you? But&mdash;I feel so stupid
  to-night, and I know I must be boring you with all this but&mdash;What would
  you do about Mother?"</p>

  <p>He gave her facile masculine advice. She was to put off her mother's stay.
  She was to tell Carrie to go to the deuce. For these valuable revelations she
  thanked him, and they ambled into the familiar gossip of the Bunch. Of what a
  sentimental fool was Carrie. Of what a lazy brat was Pete. Of how nice Fulton
  Bemis could be&mdash;"course lots of people think he's a regular old grouch
  when they meet him because he doesn't give 'em the glad hand the first crack
  out of the box, but when they get to know him, he's a corker."</p>

  <p>But as they had gone conscientiously through each of these analyses
  before, the conversation staggered. Babbitt tried to be intellectual and deal
  with General Topics. He said some thoroughly sound things about Disarmament,
  and broad-mindedness and liberalism; but it seemed to him that General Topics
  interested Tanis only when she could apply them to Pete, Carrie, or
  themselves. He was distressingly conscious of their silence. He tried to stir
  her into chattering again, but silence rose like a gray presence and hovered
  between them.</p>

  <p>"I, uh&mdash;" he labored. "It strikes me&mdash;it strikes me that
  unemployment is lessening."</p>

  <p>"Maybe Pete will get a decent job, then."</p>

  <p>Silence.</p>

  <p>Desperately he essayed, "What's the trouble, old honey? You seem kind of
  quiet to-night."</p>

  <p>"Am I? Oh, I'm not. But&mdash;do you really care whether I am or not?"</p>

  <p>"Care? Sure! Course I do!"</p>

  <p>"Do you really?" She swooped on him, sat on the arm of his chair.</p>

  <p>He hated the emotional drain of having to appear fond of her. He stroked
  her hand, smiled up at her dutifully, and sank back.</p>

  <p>"George, I wonder if you really like me at all?"</p>

  <p>"Course I do, silly."</p>

  <p>"Do you really, precious? Do you care a bit?"</p>

  <p>"Why certainly! You don't suppose I'd be here if I didn't!"</p>

  <p>"Now see here, young man, I won't have you speaking to me in that huffy
  way!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean to sound huffy. I just&mdash;" In injured and rather
  childish tones: "Gosh almighty, it makes me tired the way everybody says I
  sound huffy when I just talk natural! Do they expect me to sing it or
  something?"</p>

  <p>"Who do you mean by 'everybody'? How many other ladies have you been
  consoling?"</p>

  <p>"Look here now, I won't have this hinting!"</p>

  <p>Humbly: "I know, dear. I was only teasing. I know it didn't mean to talk
  huffy&mdash;it was just tired. Forgive bad Tanis. But say you love me, say
  it!"</p>

  <p>"I love you...Course I do."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you do!" cynically. "Oh, darling, I don't mean to be rude
  but&mdash;I get so lonely. I feel so useless. Nobody needs me, nothing I can
  do for anybody. And you know, dear, I'm so active&mdash;I could be if there
  was something to do. And I am young, aren't I! I'm not an old thing! I'm not
  old and stupid, am I?"</p>

  <p>He had to assure her. She stroked his hair, and he had to look pleased
  under that touch, the more demanding in its beguiling softness. He was
  impatient. He wanted to flee out to a hard, sure, unemotional man-world.
  Through her delicate and caressing fingers she may have caught something of
  his shrugging distaste. She left him&mdash;he was for the moment buoyantly
  relieved&mdash;she dragged a footstool to his feet and sat looking
  beseechingly up at him. But as in many men the cringing of a dog, the
  flinching of a frightened child, rouse not pity but a surprised and jerky
  cruelty, so her humility only annoyed him. And he saw her now as middle-aged,
  as beginning to be old. Even while he detested his own thoughts, they rode
  him. She was old, he winced. Old! He noted how the soft flesh was creasing
  into webby folds beneath her chin, below her eyes, at the base of her wrists.
  A patch of her throat had a minute roughness like the crumbs from a rubber
  eraser. Old! She was younger in years than himself, yet it was sickening to
  have her yearning up at him with rolling great eyes&mdash;as if, he
  shuddered, his own aunt were making love to him.</p>

  <p>He fretted inwardly, "I'm through with this asinine fooling around. I'm
  going to cut her out. She's a darn decent nice woman, and I don't want to
  hurt her, but it'll hurt a lot less to cut her right out, like a good clean
  surgical operation."</p>

  <p>He was on his feet. He was speaking urgently. By every rule of
  self-esteem, he had to prove to her, and to himself, that it was her
  fault.</p>

  <p>"I suppose maybe I'm kind of out of sorts to-night, but honest, honey,
  when I stayed away for a while to catch up on work and everything and figure
  out where I was at, you ought to have been cannier and waited till I came
  back. Can't you see, dear, when you <i>made</i> me come, I&mdash;being about
  an average bull-headed chump&mdash;my tendency was to resist? Listen, dear,
  I'm going now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not for a while, precious! No!"</p>

  <p>"Yep. Right now. And then sometime we'll see about the future."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, dear, 'about the future'? Have I done something I
  oughtn't to? Oh, I'm so dreadfully sorry!"</p>

  <p>He resolutely put his hands behind him. "Not a thing, God bless you, not a
  thing. You're as good as they make 'em. But it's just&mdash;Good Lord, do you
  realize I've got things to do in the world? I've got a business to attend to
  and, you might not believe it, but I've got a wife and kids that I'm awful
  fond of!" Then only during the murder he was committing was he able to feel
  nobly virtuous. "I want us to be friends but, gosh, I can't go on this way
  feeling I got to come up here every so often&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, darling, darling, and I've always told you, so carefully, that you
  were absolutely free. I just wanted you to come around when you were tired
  and wanted to talk to me, or when you could enjoy our parties&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was so reasonable, she was so gently right! It took him an hour to
  make his escape, with nothing settled and everything horribly settled. In a
  barren freedom of icy Northern wind he sighed, "Thank God that's over! Poor
  Tanis, poor darling decent Tanis! But it is over. Absolute! I'm free!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">His wife was up when he came in. "Did you have a good time?"
  she sniffed.</p>

  <p>"I did not. I had a rotten time! Anything else I got to explain?"</p>

  <p>"George, how can you speak like&mdash;Oh, I don't know what's come over
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, there's nothing come over me! Why do you look for trouble all
  the time?" He was warning himself, "Careful! Stop being so disagreeable.
  Course she feels it, being left alone here all evening." But he forgot his
  warning as she went on:</p>

  <p>"Why do you go out and see all sorts of strange people? I suppose you'll
  say you've been to another committee-meeting this evening!"</p>

  <p>"Nope. I've been calling on a woman. We sat by the fire and kidded each
  other and had a whale of a good time, if you want to know!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;From the way you say it, I suppose it's my fault you went
  there! I probably sent you!"</p>

  <p>"You did!"</p>

  <p>"Well, upon my word&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You hate 'strange people' as you call 'em. If you had your way, I'd be as
  much of an old stick-in-the-mud as Howard Littlefield. You never want to have
  anybody with any git to 'em at the house; you want a bunch of old stiffs that
  sit around and gas about the weather. You're doing your level best to make me
  old. Well, let me tell you, I'm not going to have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Overwhelmed she bent to his unprecedented tirade, and in answer she
  mourned:</p>

  <p>"Oh, dearest, I don't think that's true. I don't mean to make you old, I
  know. Perhaps you're partly right. Perhaps I am slow about getting acquainted
  with new people. But when you think of all the dear good times we have, and
  the supper-parties and the movies and all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With true masculine wiles he not only convinced himself that she had
  injured him but, by the loudness of his voice and the brutality of his
  attack, he convinced her also, and presently he had her apologizing for his
  having spent the evening with Tanis. He went up to bed well pleased, not only
  the master but the martyr of the household. For a distasteful moment after he
  had lain down he wondered if he had been altogether just. "Ought to be
  ashamed, bullying her. Maybe there is her side to things. Maybe she hasn't
  had such a bloomin' hectic time herself. But I don't care! Good for her to
  get waked up a little. And I'm going to keep free. Of her and Tanis and the
  fellows at the club and everybody. I'm going to run my own life!"</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">In this mood he was particularly objectionable at the
  Boosters' Club lunch next day. They were addressed by a congressman who had
  just returned from an exhaustive three-months study of the finances,
  ethnology, political systems, linguistic divisions, mineral resources, and
  agriculture of Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Austria,
  Czechoslovakia, Jugoslavia, and Bulgaria. He told them all about those
  subjects, together with three funny stories about European misconceptions of
  America and some spirited words on the necessity of keeping ignorant
  foreigners out of America.</p>

  <p>"Say, that was a mighty informative talk. Real he-stuff," said Sidney
  Finkelstein.</p>

  <p>But the disaffected Babbitt grumbled, "Four-flusher! Bunch of hot air! And
  what's the matter with the immigrants? Gosh, they aren't all ignorant, and I
  got a hunch we're all descended from immigrants ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you make me tired!" said Mr. Finkelstein.</p>

  <p>Babbitt was aware that Dr. A. I. Dilling was sternly listening from across
  the table. Dr. Dilling was one of the most important men in the Boosters'. He
  was not a physician but a surgeon, a more romantic and sounding occupation.
  He was an intense large man with a boiling of black hair and a thick black
  mustache. The newspapers often chronicled his operations; he was professor of
  surgery in the State University; he went to dinner at the very best houses on
  Royal Ridge; and he was said to be worth several hundred thousand dollars. It
  was dismaying to Babbitt to have such a person glower at him. He hastily
  praised the congressman's wit, to Sidney Finkelstein, but for Dr. Dilling's
  benefit.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">That afternoon three men shouldered into Babbitt's office
  with the air of a Vigilante committee in frontier days. They were large,
  resolute, big-jawed men, and they were all high lords in the land of
  Zenith&mdash;Dr. Dilling the surgeon, Charles McKelvey the contractor, and,
  most dismaying of all, the white-bearded Colonel Rutherford Snow, owner of
  the <i>Advocate-Times</i>. In their whelming presence Babbitt felt small and
  insignificant.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, great pleasure, have chairs, what c'n I do for you?" he
  babbled.</p>

  <p>They neither sat nor offered observations on the weather.</p>

  <p>"Babbitt," said Colonel Snow, "we've come from the Good Citizens' League.
  We've decided we want you to join. Vergil Gunch says you don't care to, but I
  think we can show you a new light. The League is going to combine with the
  Chamber of Commerce in a campaign for the Open Shop, so it's time for you to
  put your name down."</p>

  <p>In his embarrassment Babbitt could not recall his reasons for not wishing
  to join the League, if indeed he had ever definitely known them, but he was
  passionately certain that he did not wish to join, and at the thought of
  their forcing him he felt a stirring of anger against even these princes of
  commerce.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Colonel, have to think it over a little," he mumbled.</p>

  <p>McKelvey snarled, "That means you're not going to join, George?"</p>

  <p>Something black and unfamiliar and ferocious spoke from Babbitt: "Now, you
  look here, Charley! I'm damned if I'm going to be bullied into joining
  anything, not even by you plutes!"</p>

  <p>"We're not bullying anybody," Dr. Dilling began, but Colonel Snow thrust
  him aside with, "Certainly we are! We don't mind a little bullying, if it's
  necessary. Babbitt, the G.C.L. has been talking about you a good deal. You're
  supposed to be a sensible, clean, responsible man; you always have been; but
  here lately, for God knows what reason, I hear from all sorts of sources that
  you're running around with a loose crowd, and what's a whole lot worse,
  you've actually been advocating and supporting some of the most dangerous
  elements in town, like this fellow Doane."</p>

  <p>"Colonel, that strikes me as my private business."</p>

  <p>"Possibly, but we want to have an understanding. You've stood in, you and
  your father-in-law, with some of the most substantial and forward-looking
  interests in town, like my friends of the Street Traction Company, and my
  papers have given you a lot of boosts. Well, you can't expect the decent
  citizens to go on aiding you if you intend to side with precisely the people
  who are trying to undermine us."</p>

  <p>Babbitt was frightened, but he had an agonized instinct that if he yielded
  in this he would yield in everything. He protested:</p>

  <p>"You're exaggerating, Colonel. I believe in being broad-minded and
  liberal, but, of course, I'm just as much agin the cranks and blatherskites
  and labor unions and so on as you are. But fact is, I belong to so many
  organizations now that I can't do 'em justice, and I want to think it over
  before I decide about coming into the G.C.L."</p>

  <p>Colonel Snow condescended, "Oh, no, I'm not exaggerating! Why the doctor
  here heard you cussing out and defaming one of the finest types of Republican
  congressmen, just this noon! And you have entirely the wrong idea about
  'thinking over joining.' We're not begging you to join the G.C.L.&mdash;we're
  permitting you to join. I'm not sure, my boy, but what if you put it off
  it'll be too late. I'm not sure we'll want you then. Better think
  quick&mdash;better think quick!"</p>

  <p>The three Vigilantes, formidable in their righteousness, stared at him in
  a taut silence. Babbitt waited through. He thought nothing at all, he merely
  waited, while in his echoing head buzzed, "I don't want to join&mdash;I don't
  want to join&mdash;I don't want to."</p>

  <p>"All right. Sorry for you!" said Colonel Snow, and the three men abruptly
  turned their beefy backs.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">As Babbitt went out to his car that evening he saw Vergil
  Gunch coming down the block. He raised his hand in salutation, but Gunch
  ignored it and crossed the street. He was certain that Gunch had seen him. He
  drove home in sharp discomfort.</p>

  <p>His wife attacked at once: "Georgie dear, Muriel Frink was in this
  afternoon, and she says that Chum says the committee of this Good Citizens'
  League especially asked you to join and you wouldn't. Don't you think it
  would be better? You know all the nicest people belong, and the League stands
  for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know what the League stands for! It stands for the suppression of free
  speech and free thought and everything else! I don't propose to be bullied
  and rushed into joining anything, and it isn't a question of whether it's a
  good league or a bad league or what the hell kind of a league it is; it's
  just a question of my refusing to be told I got to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But dear, if you don't join, people might criticize you."</p>

  <p>"Let 'em criticize!"</p>

  <p>"But I mean <i>nice</i> people!"</p>

  <p>"Rats, I&mdash;Matter of fact, this whole League is just a fad. It's like
  all these other organizations that start off with such a rush and let on
  they're going to change the whole works, and pretty soon they peter out and
  everybody forgets all about 'em!"</p>

  <p>"But if it's <i>the</i> fad now, don't you think you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't! Oh, Myra, please quit nagging me about it. I'm sick of
  hearing about the confounded G.C.L. I almost wish I'd joined it when Verg
  first came around, and got it over. And maybe I'd 've come in to-day if the
  committee hadn't tried to bullyrag me, but, by God, as long as I'm a
  free-born independent American cit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now, George, you're talking exactly like the German furnace-man."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am, am I! Then, I won't talk at all!"</p>

  <p>He longed, that evening, to see Tanis Judique, to be strengthened by her
  sympathy. When all the family were up-stairs he got as far as telephoning to
  her apartment-house, but he was agitated about it and when the janitor
  answered he blurted, "Nev' mind&mdash;I'll call later," and hung up the
  receiver.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">If Babbitt had not been certain about Vergil Gunch's
  avoiding him, there could be little doubt about William Washington Eathorne,
  next morning. When Babbitt was driving down to the office he overtook
  Eathorne's car, with the great banker sitting in anemic solemnity behind his
  chauffeur. Babbitt waved and cried, "Mornin'!" Eathorne looked at him
  deliberately, hesitated, and gave him a nod more contemptuous than a direct
  cut.</p>

  <p>Babbitt's partner and father-in-law came in at ten:</p>

  <p>"George, what's this I hear about some song and dance you gave Colonel
  Snow about not wanting to join the G.C.L.? What the dickens you trying to do?
  Wreck the firm? You don't suppose these Big Guns will stand your bucking them
  and springing all this 'liberal' poppycock you been getting off lately, do
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, rats, Henry T., you been reading bum fiction. There ain't any such a
  thing as these plots to keep folks from being liberal. This is a free
  country. A man can do anything he wants to."</p>

  <p>"Course th' ain't any plots. Who said they was? Only if folks get an idea
  you're scatter-brained and unstable, you don't suppose they'll want to do
  business with you, do you? One little rumor about your being a crank would do
  more to ruin this business than all the plots and stuff that these fool
  story-writers could think up in a month of Sundays."</p>

  <p>That afternoon, when the old reliable Conrad Lyte, the merry miser, Conrad
  Lyte, appeared, and Babbitt suggested his buying a parcel of land in the new
  residential section of Dorchester, Lyte said hastily, too hastily, "No, no,
  don't want to go into anything new just now."</p>

  <p>A week later Babbitt learned, through Henry Thompson, that the officials
  of the Street Traction Company were planning another real-estate coup, and
  that Sanders, Torrey and Wing, not the Babbitt-Thompson Company, were to
  handle it for them. "I figure that Jake Offutt is kind of leery about the way
  folks are talking about you. Of course Jake is a rock-ribbed old die-hard,
  and he probably advised the Traction fellows to get some other broker.
  George, you got to do something!" trembled Thompson.</p>

  <p>And, in a rush, Babbitt agreed. All nonsense the way people misjudged him,
  but still&mdash;He determined to join the Good Citizens' League the next time
  he was asked, and in furious resignation he waited. He wasn't asked. They
  ignored him. He did not have the courage to go to the League and beg in, and
  he took refuge in a shaky boast that he had "gotten away with bucking the
  whole city. Nobody could dictate to him how he was going to think and
  act!"</p>

  <p>He was jarred as by nothing else when the paragon of stenographers, Miss
  McGoun, suddenly left him, though her reasons were excellent&mdash;she needed
  a rest, her sister was sick, she might not do any more work for six months.
  He was uncomfortable with her successor, Miss Havstad. What Miss Havstad's
  given name was, no one in the office ever knew. It seemed improbable that she
  had a given name, a lover, a powder-puff, or a digestion. She was so
  impersonal, this slight, pale, industrious Swede, that it was vulgar to think
  of her as going to an ordinary home to eat hash. She was a perfectly oiled
  and enameled machine, and she ought, each evening, to have been dusted off
  and shut in her desk beside her too-slim, too-frail pencil points. She took
  dictation swiftly, her typing was perfect, but Babbitt became jumpy when he
  tried to work with her. She made him feel puffy, and at his best-beloved
  daily jokes she looked gently inquiring. He longed for Miss McGoun's return,
  and thought of writing to her.</p>

  <p>Then he heard that Miss McGoun had, a week after leaving him, gone over to
  his dangerous competitors, Sanders, Torrey and Wing.</p>

  <p>He was not merely annoyed; he was frightened. "Why did she quit, then?" he
  worried. "Did she have a hunch my business is going on the rocks? And it was
  Sanders got the Street Traction deal. Rats&mdash;sinking ship!"</p>

  <p>Gray fear loomed always by him now. He watched Fritz Weilinger, the young
  salesman, and wondered if he too would leave. Daily he fancied slights. He
  noted that he was not asked to speak at the annual Chamber of Commerce
  dinner. When Orville Jones gave a large poker party and he was not invited,
  he was certain that he had been snubbed. He was afraid to go to lunch at the
  Athletic Club, and afraid not to go. He believed that he was spied on; that
  when he left the table they whispered about him. Everywhere he heard the
  rustling whispers: in the offices of clients, in the bank when he made a
  deposit, in his own office, in his own home. Interminably he wondered what
  They were saying of him. All day long in imaginary conversations he caught
  them marveling, "Babbitt? Why, say, he's a regular anarchist! You got to
  admire the fellow for his nerve, the way he turned liberal and, by golly,
  just absolutely runs his life to suit himself, but say, he's dangerous,
  that's what he is, and he's got to be shown up."</p>

  <p>He was so twitchy that when he rounded a corner and chanced on two
  acquaintances talking&mdash;whispering&mdash;his heart leaped, and he stalked
  by like an embarrassed schoolboy. When he saw his neighbors Howard
  Littlefield and Orville Jones together, he peered at them, went indoors to
  escape their spying, and was miserably certain that they had been
  whispering&mdash;plotting&mdash;whispering.</p>

  <p>Through all his fear ran defiance. He felt stubborn. Sometimes he decided
  that he had been a very devil of a fellow, as bold as Seneca Doane; sometimes
  he planned to call on Doane and tell him what a revolutionist he was, and
  never got beyond the planning. But just as often, when he heard the soft
  whispers enveloping him he wailed, "Good Lord, what have I done? Just played
  with the Bunch, and called down Clarence Drum about being such a
  high-and-mighty sodger. Never catch <i>me</i> criticizing people and trying
  to make them accept <i>my</i> ideas!"</p>

  <p>He could not stand the strain. Before long he admitted that he would like
  to flee back to the security of conformity, provided there was a decent and
  creditable way to return. But, stubbornly, he would not be forced back; he
  would not, he swore, "eat dirt."</p>

  <p>Only in spirited engagements with his wife did these turbulent fears rise
  to the surface. She complained that he seemed nervous, that she couldn't
  understand why he did not want to "drop in at the Littlefields'" for the
  evening. He tried, but he could not express to her the nebulous facts of his
  rebellion and punishment. And, with Paul and Tanis lost, he had no one to
  whom he could talk. "Good Lord, Tinka is the only real friend I have, these
  days," he sighed, and he clung to the child, played floor-games with her all
  evening.</p>

  <p>He considered going to see Paul in prison, but, though he had a pale curt
  note from him every week, he thought of Paul as dead. It was Tanis for whom
  he was longing.</p>

  <p>"I thought I was so smart and independent, cutting Tanis out, and I need
  her, Lord how I need her!" he raged. "Myra simply can't understand. All she
  sees in life is getting along by being just like other folks. But Tanis,
  she'd tell me I was all right."</p>

  <p>Then he broke, and one evening, late, he did run to Tanis. He had not
  dared to hope for it, but she was in, and alone. Only she wasn't Tanis. She
  was a courteous, brow-lifting, ice-armored woman who looked like Tanis. She
  said, "Yes, George, what is it?" in even and uninterested tones, and he crept
  away, whipped.</p>

  <p>His first comfort was from Ted and Eunice Littlefield.</p>

  <p>They danced in one evening when Ted was home from the university, and Ted
  chuckled, "What's this I hear from Euny, dad? She says her dad says you
  raised Cain by boosting old Seneca Doane. Hot dog! Give 'em fits! Stir 'em
  up! This old burg is asleep!" Eunice plumped down on Babbitt's lap, kissed
  him, nestled her bobbed hair against his chin, and crowed; "I think you're
  lots nicer than Howard. Why is it," confidentially, "that Howard is such an
  old grouch? The man has a good heart, and honestly, he's awfully bright, but
  he never will learn to step on the gas, after all the training I've given
  him. Don't you think we could do something with him, dearest?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Eunice, that isn't a nice way to speak of your papa," Babbitt
  observed, in the best Floral Heights manner, but he was happy for the first
  time in weeks. He pictured himself as the veteran liberal strengthened by the
  loyalty of the young generation. They went out to rifle the ice-box. Babbitt
  gloated, "If your mother caught us at this, we'd certainly get our
  come-uppance!" and Eunice became maternal, scrambled a terrifying number of
  eggs for them, kissed Babbitt on the ear, and in the voice of a brooding
  abbess marveled, "It beats the devil why feminists like me still go on
  nursing these men!"</p>

  <p>Thus stimulated, Babbitt was reckless when he encountered Sheldon Smeeth,
  educational director of the Y.M.C.A. and choir-leader of the Chatham Road
  Church. With one of his damp hands Smeeth imprisoned Babbitt's thick paw
  while he chanted, "Brother Babbitt, we haven't seen you at church very often
  lately. I know you're busy with a multitude of details, but you mustn't
  forget your dear friends at the old church home."</p>

  <p>Babbitt shook off the affectionate clasp&mdash;Sheldy liked to hold hands
  for a long time&mdash;and snarled, "Well, I guess you fellows can run the
  show without me. Sorry, Smeeth; got to beat it. G'day."</p>

  <p>But afterward he winced, "If that white worm had the nerve to try to drag
  me back to the Old Church Home, then the holy outfit must have been doing a
  lot of talking about me, too."</p>

  <p>He heard them whispering&mdash;whispering&mdash;Dr. John Jennison Drew,
  Cholmondeley Frink, even William Washington Eathorne. The independence seeped
  out of him and he walked the streets alone, afraid of men's cynical eyes and
  the incessant hiss of whispering.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">He tried to explain to his wife, as they prepared for bed,
  how objectionable was Sheldon Smeeth, but all her answer was, "He has such a
  beautiful voice&mdash;so spiritual. I don't think you ought to speak of him
  like that just because you can't appreciate music!" He saw her then as a
  stranger; he stared bleakly at this plump and fussy woman with the broad bare
  arms, and wondered how she had ever come here.</p>

  <p>In his chilly cot, turning from aching side to side, he pondered of Tanis.
  "He'd been a fool to lose her. He had to have somebody he could really talk
  to. He'd&mdash;oh, he'd <i>bust</i> if he went on stewing about things by
  himself. And Myra, useless to expect her to understand. Well, rats, no use
  dodging the issue. Darn shame for two married people to drift apart after all
  these years; darn rotten shame; but nothing could bring them together now, as
  long as he refused to let Zenith bully him into taking orders&mdash;and he
  was by golly not going to let anybody bully him into anything, or wheedle him
  or coax him either!"</p>

  <p>He woke at three, roused by a passing motor, and struggled out of bed for
  a drink of water. As he passed through the bedroom he heard his wife groan.
  His resentment was night-blurred; he was solicitous in inquiring, "What's the
  trouble, hon?"</p>

  <p>"I've got&mdash;such a pain down here in my side&mdash;oh, it's
  just&mdash;it tears at me."</p>

  <p>"Bad indigestion? Shall I get you some bicarb?"</p>

  <p>"Don't think&mdash;that would help. I felt funny last evening and
  yesterday, and then&mdash;oh!&mdash;it passed away and I got to sleep
  and&mdash;That auto woke me up."</p>

  <p>Her voice was laboring like a ship in a storm. He was alarmed.</p>

  <p>"I better call the doctor."</p>

  <p>"No, no! It'll go away. But maybe you might get me an ice-bag."</p>

  <p>He stalked to the bathroom for the ice-bag, down to the kitchen for ice.
  He felt dramatic in this late-night expedition, but as he gouged the chunk of
  ice with the dagger-like pick he was cool, steady, mature; and the old
  friendliness was in his voice as he patted the ice-bag into place on her
  groin, rumbling, "There, there, that'll be better now." He retired to bed,
  but he did not sleep. He heard her groan again. Instantly he was up, soothing
  her, "Still pretty bad, honey?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it just gripes me, and I can't get to sleep."</p>

  <p>Her voice was faint. He knew her dread of doctors' verdicts and he did not
  inform her, but he creaked down-stairs, telephoned to Dr. Earl Patten, and
  waited, shivering, trying with fuzzy eyes to read a magazine, till he heard
  the doctor's car.</p>

  <p>The doctor was youngish and professionally breezy. He came in as though it
  were sunny noontime. "Well, George, little trouble, eh? How is she now?" he
  said busily as, with tremendous and rather irritating cheerfulness, he tossed
  his coat on a chair and warmed his hands at a radiator. He took charge of the
  house. Babbitt felt ousted and unimportant as he followed the doctor up to
  the bedroom, and it was the doctor who chuckled, "Oh, just little
  stomach-ache" when Verona peeped through her door, begging, "What is it, Dad,
  what is it?"</p>

  <p>To Mrs. Babbitt the doctor said with amiable belligerence, after his
  examination, "Kind of a bad old pain, eh? I'll give you something to make you
  sleep, and I think you'll feel better in the morning. I'll come in right
  after breakfast." But to Babbitt, lying in wait in the lower hall, the doctor
  sighed, "I don't like the feeling there in her belly. There's some rigidity
  and some inflammation. She's never had her appendix out has she? Um. Well, no
  use worrying. I'll be here first thing in the morning, and meantime she'll
  get some rest. I've given her a hypo. Good night."</p>

  <p>Then was Babbitt caught up in the black tempest.</p>

  <p>Instantly all the indignations which had been dominating him and the
  spiritual dramas through which he had struggled became pallid and absurd
  before the ancient and overwhelming realities, the standard and traditional
  realities, of sickness and menacing death, the long night, and the thousand
  steadfast implications of married life. He crept back to her. As she drowsed
  away in the tropic languor of morphia, he sat on the edge of her bed, holding
  her hand, and for the first time in many weeks her hand abode trustfully in
  his.</p>

  <p>He draped himself grotesquely in his toweling bathrobe and a pink and
  white couch-cover, and sat lumpishly in a wing-chair. The bedroom was uncanny
  in its half-light, which turned the curtains to lurking robbers, the
  dressing-table to a turreted castle. It smelled of cosmetics, of linen, of
  sleep. He napped and woke, napped and woke, a hundred times. He heard her
  move and sigh in slumber; he wondered if there wasn't some officious brisk
  thing he could do for her, and before he could quite form the thought he was
  asleep, racked and aching. The night was infinite. When dawn came and the
  waiting seemed at an end, he fell asleep, and was vexed to have been caught
  off his guard, to have been aroused by Verona's entrance and her agitated
  "Oh, what is it, Dad?"</p>

  <p>His wife was awake, her face sallow and lifeless in the morning light, but
  now he did not compare her with Tanis; she was not merely A Woman, to be
  contrasted with other women, but his own self, and though he might criticize
  her and nag her, it was only as he might criticize and nag himself,
  interestedly, unpatronizingly, without the expectation of changing&mdash;or
  any real desire to change&mdash;the eternal essence.</p>

  <p>With Verona he sounded fatherly again, and firm. He consoled Tinka, who
  satisfactorily pointed the excitement of the hour by wailing. He ordered
  early breakfast, and wanted to look at the newspaper, and felt somehow heroic
  and useful in not looking at it. But there were still crawling and totally
  unheroic hours of waiting before Dr. Patten returned.</p>

  <p>"Don't see much change," said Patten. "I'll be back about eleven, and if
  you don't mind, I think I'll bring in some other world-famous pill-pedler for
  consultation, just to be on the safe side. Now George, there's nothing you
  can do. I'll have Verona keep the ice-bag filled&mdash;might as well leave
  that on, I guess&mdash;and you, you better beat it to the office instead of
  standing around her looking as if you were the patient. The nerve of
  husbands! Lot more neurotic than the women! They always have to horn in and
  get all the credit for feeling bad when their wives are ailing. Now have
  another nice cup of coffee and git!"</p>

  <p>Under this derision Babbitt became more matter-of-fact. He drove to the
  office, tried to dictate letters, tried to telephone and, before the call was
  answered, forgot to whom he was telephoning. At a quarter after ten he
  returned home. As he left the down-town traffic and sped up the car, his face
  was as grimly creased as the mask of tragedy.</p>

  <p>His wife greeted him with surprise. "Why did you come back, dear? I think
  I feel a little better. I told Verona to skip off to her office. Was it
  wicked of me to go and get sick?"</p>

  <p>He knew that she wanted petting, and she got it, joyously. They were
  curiously happy when he heard Dr. Patten's car in front. He looked out of the
  window. He was frightened. With Patten was an impatient man with turbulent
  black hair and a hussar mustache&mdash;Dr. A. I. Dilling, the surgeon.
  Babbitt sputtered with anxiety, tried to conceal it, and hurried down to the
  door.</p>

  <p>Dr. Patten was profusely casual: "Don't want to worry you, old man, but I
  thought it might be a good stunt to have Dr. Dilling examine her." He
  gestured toward Dilling as toward a master.</p>

  <p>Dilling nodded in his curtest manner and strode up-stairs Babbitt tramped
  the living-room in agony. Except for his wife's confinements there had never
  been a major operation in the family, and to him surgery was at once a
  miracle and an abomination of fear. But when Dilling and Patten came down
  again he knew that everything was all right, and he wanted to laugh, for the
  two doctors were exactly like the bearded physicians in a musical comedy,
  both of them rubbing their hands and looking foolishly sagacious.</p>

  <p>Dr. Dilling spoke:</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, old man, but it's acute appendicitis. We ought to operate. Of
  course you must decide, but there's no question as to what has to be
  done."</p>

  <p>Babbitt did not get all the force of it. He mumbled, "Well I suppose we
  could get her ready in a couple o' days. Probably Ted ought to come down from
  the university, just in case anything happened."</p>

  <p>Dr. Dilling growled, "Nope. If you don't want peritonitis to set in, we'll
  have to operate right away. I must advise it strongly. If you say go ahead,
  I'll 'phone for the St. Mary's ambulance at once, and we'll have her on the
  table in three-quarters of an hour."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I Of course, I suppose you know what&mdash;But great God, man, I
  can't get her clothes ready and everything in two seconds, you know! And in
  her state, so wrought-up and weak&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just throw her hair-brush and comb and tooth-brush in a bag; that's all
  she'll need for a day or two," said Dr. Dilling, and went to the
  telephone.</p>

  <p>Babbitt galloped desperately up-stairs. He sent the frightened Tinka out
  of the room. He said gaily to his wife, "Well, old thing, the doc thinks
  maybe we better have a little operation and get it over. Just take a few
  minutes&mdash;not half as serious as a confinement&mdash;and you'll be all
  right in a jiffy."</p>

  <p>She gripped his hand till the fingers ached. She said patiently, like a
  cowed child, "I'm afraid&mdash;to go into the dark, all alone!" Maturity was
  wiped from her eyes; they were pleading and terrified. "Will you stay with
  me? Darling, you don't have to go to the office now, do you? Could you just
  go down to the hospital with me? Could you come see me this evening&mdash;if
  everything's all right? You won't have to go out this evening, will you?"</p>

  <p>He was on his knees by the bed. While she feebly ruffled his hair, he
  sobbed, he kissed the lawn of her sleeve, and swore, "Old honey, I love you
  more than anything in the world! I've kind of been worried by business and
  everything, but that's all over now, and I'm back again."</p>

  <p>"Are you really? George, I was thinking, lying here, maybe it would be a
  good thing if I just <i>went</i>. I was wondering if anybody really needed
  me. Or wanted me. I was wondering what was the use of my living. I've been
  getting so stupid and ugly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why, you old humbug! Fishing for compliments when I ought to be packing
  your bag! Me, sure, I'm young and handsome and a regular village cut-up
  and&mdash;" He could not go on. He sobbed again; and in muttered
  incoherencies they found each other.</p>

  <p>As he packed, his brain was curiously clear and swift. He'd have no more
  wild evenings, he realized. He admitted that he would regret them. A little
  grimly he perceived that this had been his last despairing fling before the
  paralyzed contentment of middle-age. Well, and he grinned impishly, "it was
  one doggone good party while it lasted!" And&mdash;how much was the operation
  going to cost? "I ought to have fought that out with Dilling. But no, damn
  it, I don't care how much it costs!"</p>

  <p>The motor ambulance was at the door. Even in his grief the Babbitt who
  admired all technical excellences was interested in the kindly skill with
  which the attendants slid Mrs. Babbitt upon a stretcher and carried her
  down-stairs. The ambulance was a huge, suave, varnished, white thing. Mrs.
  Babbitt moaned, "It frightens me. It's just like a hearse, just like being
  put in a hearse. I want you to stay with me."</p>

  <p>"I'll be right up front with the driver," Babbitt promised.</p>

  <p>"No, I want you to stay inside with me." To the attendants: "Can't he be
  inside?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, ma'am, you bet. There's a fine little camp-stool in there," the
  older attendant said, with professional pride.</p>

  <p>He sat beside her in that traveling cabin with its cot, its stool, its
  active little electric radiator, and its quite unexplained calendar,
  displaying a girl eating cherries, and the name of an enterprising grocer.
  But as he flung out his hand in hopeless cheerfulness it touched the
  radiator, and he squealed:</p>

  <p>"Ouch! Jesus!"</p>

  <p>"Why, George Babbitt, I won't have you cursing and swearing and
  blaspheming!"</p>

  <p>"I know, awful sorry but&mdash;Gosh all fish-hooks, look how I burned my
  hand! Gee whiz, it hurts! It hurts like the mischief! Why, that damn radiator
  is hot as&mdash;it's hot as&mdash;it's hotter 'n the hinges of Hades! Look!
  You can see the mark!"</p>

  <p>So, as they drove up to St. Mary's Hospital, with the nurses already
  laying out the instruments for an operation to save her life, it was she who
  consoled him and kissed the place to make it well, and though he tried to be
  gruff and mature, he yielded to her and was glad to be babied.</p>

  <p>The ambulance whirled under the hooded carriage-entrance of the hospital,
  and instantly he was reduced to a zero in the nightmare succession of
  cork-floored halls, endless doors open on old women sitting up in bed, an
  elevator, the anesthetizing room, a young interne contemptuous of husbands.
  He was permitted to kiss his wife; he saw a thin dark nurse fit the cone over
  her mouth and nose; he stiffened at a sweet and treacherous odor; then he was
  driven out, and on a high stool in a laboratory he sat dazed, longing to see
  her once again, to insist that he had always loved her, had never for a
  second loved anybody else or looked at anybody else. In the laboratory he was
  conscious only of a decayed object preserved in a bottle of yellowing
  alcohol. It made him very sick, but he could not take his eyes from it. He
  was more aware of it than of waiting. His mind floated in abeyance, coming
  back always to that horrible bottle. To escape it he opened the door to the
  right, hoping to find a sane and business-like office. He realized that he
  was looking into the operating-room; in one glance he took in Dr. Dilling,
  strange in white gown and bandaged head, bending over the steel table with
  its screws and wheels, then nurses holding basins and cotton sponges, and a
  swathed thing, just a lifeless chin and a mound of white in the midst of
  which was a square of sallow flesh with a gash a little bloody at the edges,
  protruding from the gash a cluster of forceps like clinging parasites.</p>

  <p>He shut the door with haste. It may be that his frightened repentance of
  the night and morning had not eaten in, but this dehumanizing interment of
  her who had been so pathetically human shook him utterly, and as he crouched
  again on the high stool in the laboratory he swore faith to his wife...to
  Zenith...to business efficiency...to the Boosters' Club...to every faith of
  the Clan of Good Fellows.</p>

  <p>Then a nurse was soothing, "All over! Perfect success! She'll come out
  fine! She'll be out from under the anesthetic soon, and you can see her."</p>

  <p>He found her on a curious tilted bed, her face an unwholesome yellow but
  her purple lips moving slightly. Then only did he really believe that she was
  alive. She was muttering. He bent, and heard her sighing, "Hard get real
  maple syrup for pancakes." He laughed inexhaustibly; he beamed on the nurse
  and proudly confided, "Think of her talking about maple syrup! By golly, I'm
  going to go and order a hundred gallons of it, right from Vermont!"</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">She was out of the hospital in seventeen days. He went to
  see her each afternoon, and in their long talks they drifted back to
  intimacy. Once he hinted something of his relations to Tanis and the Bunch,
  and she was inflated by the view that a Wicked Woman had captivated her poor
  George.</p>

  <p>If once he had doubted his neighbors and the supreme charm of the Good
  Fellows, he was convinced now. You didn't, he noted, "see Seneca Doane coming
  around with any flowers or dropping in to chat with the Missus," but Mrs.
  Howard Littlefield brought to the hospital her priceless wine jelly (flavored
  with real wine); Orville Jones spent hours in picking out the kind of novels
  Mrs. Babbitt liked&mdash;nice love stories about New York millionaries and
  Wyoming cowpunchers; Louetta Swanson knitted a pink bed-jacket; Sidney
  Finkelstein and his merry brown-eyed flapper of a wife selected the prettiest
  nightgown in all the stock of Parcher and Stein.</p>

  <p>All his friends ceased whispering about him, suspecting him. At the
  Athletic Club they asked after her daily. Club members whose names he did not
  know stopped him to inquire, "How's your good lady getting on?" Babbitt felt
  that he was swinging from bleak uplands down into the rich warm air of a
  valley pleasant with cottages.</p>

  <p>One noon Vergil Gunch suggested, "You planning to be at the hospital about
  six? The wife and I thought we'd drop in." They did drop in. Gunch was so
  humorous that Mrs. Babbitt said he must "stop making her laugh because
  honestly it was hurting her incision." As they passed down the hall Gunch
  demanded amiably, "George, old scout, you were soreheaded about something,
  here a while back. I don't know why, and it's none of my business. But you
  seem to be feeling all hunky-dory again, and why don't you come join us in
  the Good Citizens' League, old man? We have some corking times together, and
  we need your advice."</p>

  <p>Then did Babbitt, almost tearful with joy at being coaxed instead of
  bullied, at being permitted to stop fighting, at being able to desert without
  injuring his opinion of himself, cease utterly to be a domestic
  revolutionist. He patted Gunch's shoulder, and next day he became a member of
  the Good Citizens' League.</p>

  <p>Within two weeks no one in the League was more violent regarding the
  wickedness of Seneca Doane, the crimes of labor unions, the perils of
  immigration, and the delights of golf, morality, and bank-accounts than was
  George F. Babbitt.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34">CHAPTER XXXIV</a></h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">The Good Citizens' League had spread through the country,
  but nowhere was it so effective and well esteemed as in cities of the type of
  Zenith, commercial cities of a few hundred thousand inhabitants, most of
  which&mdash;though not all&mdash;lay inland, against a background of
  cornfields and mines and of small towns which depended upon them for
  mortgage-loans, table-manners, art, social philosophy and millinery.</p>

  <p>To the League belonged most of the prosperous citizens of Zenith. They
  were not all of the kind who called themselves "Regular Guys." Besides these
  hearty fellows, these salesmen of prosperity, there were the aristocrats,
  that is, the men who were richer or had been rich for more generations: the
  presidents of banks and of factories, the land-owners, the corporation
  lawyers, the fashionable doctors, and the few young-old men who worked not at
  all but, reluctantly remaining in Zenith, collected luster-ware and first
  editions as though they were back in Paris. All of them agreed that the
  working-classes must be kept in their place; and all of them perceived that
  American Democracy did not imply any equality of wealth, but did demand a
  wholesome sameness of thought, dress, painting, morals, and vocabulary.</p>

  <p>In this they were like the ruling-class of any other country, particularly
  of Great Britain, but they differed in being more vigorous and in actually
  trying to produce the accepted standards which all classes, everywhere,
  desire, but usually despair of realizing.</p>

  <p>The longest struggle of the Good Citizens' League was against the Open
  Shop&mdash;which was secretly a struggle against all union labor.
  Accompanying it was an Americanization Movement, with evening classes in
  English and history and economics, and daily articles in the newspapers, so
  that newly arrived foreigners might learn that the true-blue and one hundred
  per cent. American way of settling labor-troubles was for workmen to trust
  and love their employers.</p>

  <p>The League was more than generous in approving other organizations which
  agreed with its aims. It helped the Y.M. C.A. to raise a
  two-hundred-thousand-dollar fund for a new building. Babbitt, Vergil Gunch,
  Sidney Finkelstein, and even Charles McKelvey told the spectators at movie
  theaters how great an influence for manly Christianity the "good old Y." had
  been in their own lives; and the hoar and mighty Colonel Rutherford Snow,
  owner of the <i>Advocate-Times</i>, was photographed clasping the hand of
  Sheldon Smeeth of the Y.M.C.A. It is true that afterward, when Smeeth lisped,
  "You must come to one of our prayer-meetings," the ferocious Colonel
  bellowed, "What the hell would I do that for? I've got a bar of my own," but
  this did not appear in the public prints.</p>

  <p>The League was of value to the American Legion at a time when certain of
  the lesser and looser newspapers were criticizing that organization of
  veterans of the Great War. One evening a number of young men raided the
  Zenith Socialist Headquarters, burned its records, beat the office staff, and
  agreeably dumped desks out of the window. All of the newspapers save the
  <i>Advocate-Times</i> and the <i>Evening Advocate</i> attributed this
  valuable but perhaps hasty direct-action to the American Legion. Then a
  flying squadron from the Good Citizens' League called on the unfair papers
  and explained that no ex-soldier could possibly do such a thing, and the
  editors saw the light, and retained their advertising. When Zenith's lone
  Conscientious Objector came home from prison and was righteously run out of
  town, the newspapers referred to the perpetrators as an "unidentified
  mob."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">In all the activities and triumphs of the Good Citizens'
  League Babbitt took part, and completely won back to self-respect, placidity,
  and the affection of his friends. But he began to protest, "Gosh, I've done
  my share in cleaning up the city. I want to tend to business. Think I'll just
  kind of slacken up on this G.C.L. stuff now."</p>

  <p>He had returned to the church as he had returned to the Boosters' Club. He
  had even endured the lavish greeting which Sheldon Smeeth gave him. He was
  worried lest during his late discontent he had imperiled his salvation. He
  was not quite sure there was a Heaven to be attained, but Dr. John Jennison
  Drew said there was, and Babbitt was not going to take a chance.</p>

  <p>One evening when he was walking past Dr. Drew's parsonage he impulsively
  went in and found the pastor in his study.</p>

  <p>"Jus' minute&mdash;getting 'phone call," said Dr. Drew in businesslike
  tones, then, aggressively, to the telephone: "'Lo&mdash;'lo! This Berkey and
  Hannis? Reverend Drew speaking. Where the dickens is the proof for next
  Sunday's calendar? Huh? Y' ought to have it here. Well, I can't help it if
  they're <i>all</i> sick! I got to have it to-night. Get an A.D.T. boy and
  shoot it up here quick."</p>

  <p>He turned, without slackening his briskness. "Well, Brother Babbitt, what
  c'n I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"I just wanted to ask&mdash;Tell you how it is, dominie: Here a while ago
  I guess I got kind of slack. Took a few drinks and so on. What I wanted to
  ask is: How is it if a fellow cuts that all out and comes back to his senses?
  Does it sort of, well, you might say, does it score against him in the long
  run?"</p>

  <p>The Reverend Dr. Drew was suddenly interested. "And, uh, brother&mdash;the
  other things, too? Women?"</p>

  <p>"No, practically, you might say, practically not at all."</p>

  <p>"Don't hesitate to tell me, brother! That's what I'm here for. Been going
  on joy-rides? Squeezing girls in cars?" The reverend eyes glistened.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you. I've got a deputation from the Don't Make
  Prohibition a Joke Association coming to see me in a quarter of an hour, and
  one from the Anti-Birth-Control Union at a quarter of ten." He busily glanced
  at his watch. "But I can take five minutes off and pray with you. Kneel right
  down by your chair, brother. Don't be ashamed to seek the guidance of
  God."</p>

  <p>Babbitt's scalp itched and he longed to flee, but Dr. Drew had already
  flopped down beside his desk-chair and his voice had changed from rasping
  efficiency to an unctuous familiarity with sin and with the Almighty. Babbitt
  also knelt, while Drew gloated:</p>

  <p>"O Lord, thou seest our brother here, who has been led astray by manifold
  temptations. O Heavenly Father, make his heart to be pure, as pure as a
  little child's. Oh, let him know again the joy of a manly courage to abstain
  from evil&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sheldon Smeeth came frolicking into the study. At the sight of the two men
  he smirked, forgivingly patted Babbitt on the shoulder, and knelt beside him,
  his arm about him, while he authorized Dr. Drew's imprecations with moans of
  "Yes, Lord! Help our brother, Lord!"</p>

  <p>Though he was trying to keep his eyes closed, Babbitt squinted between his
  fingers and saw the pastor glance at his watch as he concluded with a
  triumphant, "And let him never be afraid to come to Us for counsel and tender
  care, and let him know that the church can lead him as a little lamb."</p>

  <p>Dr. Drew sprang up, rolled his eyes in the general direction of Heaven,
  chucked his watch into his pocket, and demanded, "Has the deputation come
  yet, Sheldy?"</p>

  <p>"Yep, right outside," Sheldy answered, with equal liveliness; then,
  caressingly, to Babbitt, "Brother, if it would help, I'd love to go into the
  next room and pray with you while Dr. Drew is receiving the brothers from the
  Don't Make Prohibition a Joke Association."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no thanks&mdash;can't take the time!" yelped Babbitt, rushing
  toward the door.</p>

  <p>Thereafter he was often seen at the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church, but
  it is recorded that he avoided shaking hands with the pastor at the door.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">If his moral fiber had been so weakened by rebellion that he
  was not quite dependable in the more rigorous campaigns of the Good Citizens'
  League nor quite appreciative of the church, yet there was no doubt of the
  joy with which Babbitt returned to the pleasures of his home and of the
  Athletic Club, the Boosters, the Elks.</p>

  <p>Verona and Kenneth Escott were eventually and hesitatingly married. For
  the wedding Babbitt was dressed as carefully as was Verona; he was crammed
  into the morning-coat he wore to teas thrice a year; and with a certain
  relief, after Verona and Kenneth had driven away in a limousine, he returned
  to the house, removed the morning coat, sat with his aching feet up on the
  davenport, and reflected that his wife and he could have the living-room to
  themselves now, and not have to listen to Verona and Kenneth worrying, in a
  cultured collegiate manner, about minimum wages and the Drama League.</p>

  <p>But even this sinking into peace was less consoling than his return to
  being one of the best-loved men in the Boosters' Club.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">President Willis Ijams began that Boosters' Club luncheon by
  standing quiet and staring at them so unhappily that they feared he was about
  to announce the death of a Brother Booster. He spoke slowly then, and
  gravely:</p>

  <p>"Boys, I have something shocking to reveal to you; something terrible
  about one of our own members."</p>

  <p>Several Boosters, including Babbitt, looked disconcerted.</p>

  <p>"A knight of the grip, a trusted friend of mine, recently made a trip
  up-state, and in a certain town, where a certain Booster spent his boyhood,
  he found out something which can no longer be concealed. In fact, he
  discovered the inward nature of a man whom we have accepted as a Real Guy and
  as one of us. Gentlemen, I cannot trust my voice to say it, so I have written
  it down."</p>

  <p>He uncovered a large blackboard and on it, in huge capitals, was the
  legend:</p>

  <p>George Follansbee Babbitt&mdash;oh you Folly!</p>

  <p>The Boosters cheered, they laughed, they wept, they threw rolls at
  Babbitt, they cried, "Speech, speech! Oh you Folly!"</p>

  <p>President Ijams continued:</p>

  <p>"That, gentlemen, is the awful thing Georgie Babbitt has been concealing
  all these years, when we thought he was just plain George F. Now I want you
  to tell us, taking it in turn, what you've always supposed the F. stood
  for."</p>

  <p>Flivver, they suggested, and Frog-face and Flathead and Farinaceous and
  Freezone and Flapdoodle and Foghorn. By the joviality of their insults
  Babbitt knew that he had been taken back to their hearts, and happily he
  rose.</p>

  <p>"Boys, I've got to admit it. I've never worn a wrist-watch, or parted my
  name in the middle, but I will confess to 'Follansbee.' My only justification
  is that my old dad&mdash;though otherwise he was perfectly sane, and packed
  an awful wallop when it came to trimming the City Fellers at
  checkers&mdash;named me after the family doc, old Dr. Ambrose Follansbee. I
  apologize, boys. In my next what-d'you-call-it I'll see to it that I get
  named something really practical&mdash;something that sounds swell and yet is
  good and virile&mdash;something, in fact, like that grand old name so
  familiar to every household&mdash;that bold and almost overpowering name,
  Willis Jimjams Ijams!"</p>

  <p>He knew by the cheer that he was secure again and popular; he knew that he
  would no more endanger his security and popularity by straying from the Clan
  of Good Fellows.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">Henry Thompson dashed into the office, clamoring, "George!
  Big news! Jake Offutt says the Traction Bunch are dissatisfied with the way
  Sanders, Torrey and Wing handled their last deal, and they're willing to
  dicker with us!"</p>

  <p>Babbitt was pleased in the realization that the last scar of his rebellion
  was healed, yet as he drove home he was annoyed by such background thoughts
  as had never weakened him in his days of belligerent conformity. He
  discovered that he actually did not consider the Traction group quite honest.
  "Well, he'd carry out one more deal for them, but as soon as it was
  practicable, maybe as soon as old Henry Thompson died, he'd break away from
  all association from them. He was forty-eight; in twelve years he'd be sixty;
  he wanted to leave a clean business to his grandchildren. Course there was a
  lot of money in negotiating for the Traction people, and a fellow had to look
  at things in a practical way, only&mdash;" He wriggled uncomfortably. He
  wanted to tell the Traction group what he thought of them. "Oh, he couldn't
  do it, not now. If he offended them this second time, they would crush him.
  But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was conscious that his line of progress seemed confused. He wondered
  what he would do with his future. He was still young; was he through with all
  adventuring? He felt that he had been trapped into the very net from which he
  had with such fury escaped and, supremest jest of all, been made to rejoice
  in the trapping.</p>

  <p>"They've licked me; licked me to a finish!" he whimpered.</p>

  <p>The house was peaceful, that evening, and he enjoyed a game of pinochle
  with his wife. He indignantly told the Tempter that he was content to do
  things in the good old fashioned way. The day after, he went to see the
  purchasing-agent of the Street Traction Company and they made plans for the
  secret purchase of lots along the Evanston Road. But as he drove to his
  office he struggled, "I'm going to run things and figure out things to suit
  myself&mdash;when I retire."</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">Ted had come down from the University for the week-end.
  Though he no longer spoke of mechanical engineering and though he was
  reticent about his opinion of his instructors, he seemed no more reconciled
  to college, and his chief interest was his wireless telephone set.</p>

  <p>On Saturday evening he took Eunice Littlefield to a dance at Devon Woods.
  Babbitt had a glimpse of her, bouncing in the seat of the car, brilliant in a
  scarlet cloak over a frock of thinnest creamy silk. They two had not returned
  when the Babbitts went to bed, at half-past eleven. At a blurred indefinite
  time of late night Babbitt was awakened by the ring of the telephone and
  gloomily crawled down-stairs. Howard Littlefield was speaking:</p>

  <p>"George, Euny isn't back yet. Is Ted?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;at least his door is open&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They ought to be home. Eunice said the dance would be over at midnight.
  What's the name of those people where they're going?"</p>

  <p>"Why, gosh, tell the truth, I don't know, Howard. It's some classmate of
  Ted's, out in Devon Woods. Don't see what we can do. Wait, I'll skip up and
  ask Myra if she knows their name."</p>

  <p>Babbitt turned on the light in Ted's room. It was a brown boyish room;
  disordered dresser, worn books, a high-school pennant, photographs of
  basket-ball teams and baseball teams. Ted was decidedly not there.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Babbitt, awakened, irritably observed that she certainly did not know
  the name of Ted's host, that it was late, that Howard Littlefield was but
  little better than a born fool, and that she was sleepy. But she remained
  awake and worrying while Babbitt, on the sleeping-porch, struggled back into
  sleep through the incessant soft rain of her remarks. It was after dawn when
  he was aroused by her shaking him and calling "George! George!" in something
  like horror.</p>

  <p>"Wha&mdash;wha&mdash;what is it?"</p>

  <p>"Come here quick and see. Be quiet!"</p>

  <p>She led him down the hall to the door of Ted's room and pushed it gently
  open. On the worn brown rug he saw a froth of rose-colored chiffon lingerie;
  on the sedate Morris chair a girl's silver slipper. And on the pillows were
  two sleepy heads&mdash;Ted's and Eunice's.</p>

  <p>Ted woke to grin, and to mutter with unconvincing defiance, "Good morning!
  Let me introduce my wife&mdash;Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt Eunice Littlefield
  Babbitt, Esquiress."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" from Babbitt, and from his wife a long wailing, "You've gone
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We got married last evening. Wife! Sit up and say a pretty good morning
  to mother-in-law."</p>

  <p>But Eunice hid her shoulders and her charming wild hair under the
  pillow.</p>

  <p>By nine o'clock the assembly which was gathered about Ted and Eunice in
  the living-room included Mr. and Mrs. George Babbitt, Dr. and Mrs. Howard
  Littlefield, Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Escott, Mr. and Mrs. Henry T. Thompson, and
  Tinka Babbitt, who was the only pleased member of the inquisition.</p>

  <p>A crackling shower of phrases filled the room:</p>

  <p>"At their age&mdash;" "Ought to be annulled&mdash;" "Never heard of such a
  thing in&mdash;" "Fault of both of them and&mdash;" "Keep it out of the
  papers&mdash;" "Ought to be packed off to school&mdash;" "Do something about
  it at once, and what I say is&mdash;" "Damn good old-fashioned
  spanking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Worst of them all was Verona. "<i>Ted</i>! Some way <i>must</i> be found
  to make you understand how dreadfully <i>serious</i> this is, instead of
  standing <i>around</i> with that silly foolish <i>smile</i> on your
  face!"</p>

  <p>He began to revolt. "Gee whittakers, Rone, you got married yourself,
  didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"That's entirely different."</p>

  <p>"You bet it is! They didn't have to work on Eu and me with a chain and
  tackle to get us to hold hands!"</p>

  <p>"Now, young man, we'll have no more flippancy," old Henry Thompson
  ordered. "You listen to me."</p>

  <p>"You listen to Grandfather!" said Verona.</p>

  <p>"Yes, listen to your Grandfather!" said Mrs. Babbitt.</p>

  <p>"Ted, you listen to Mr. Thompson!" said Howard Littlefield.</p>

  <p>"Oh, for the love o' Mike, I am listening!" Ted shouted. "But you look
  here, all of you! I'm getting sick and tired of being the corpse in this post
  mortem! If you want to kill somebody, go kill the preacher that married us!
  Why, he stung me five dollars, and all the money I had in the world was six
  dollars and two bits. I'm getting just about enough of being hollered
  at!"</p>

  <p>A new voice, booming, authoritative, dominated the room. It was Babbitt.
  "Yuh, there's too darn many putting in their oar! Rone, you dry up. Howard
  and I are still pretty strong, and able to do our own cussing. Ted, come into
  the dining-room and we'll talk this over."</p>

  <p>In the dining-room, the door firmly closed, Babbitt walked to his son, put
  both hands on his shoulders. "You're more or less right. They all talk too
  much. Now what do you plan to do, old man?"</p>

  <p>"Gosh, dad, are you really going to be human?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I&mdash;Remember one time you called us 'the Babbitt men' and said
  we ought to stick together? I want to. I don't pretend to think this isn't
  serious. The way the cards are stacked against a young fellow to-day, I can't
  say I approve of early marriages. But you couldn't have married a better girl
  than Eunice; and way I figure it, Littlefield is darn lucky to get a Babbitt
  for a son-in-law! But what do you plan to do? Course you could go right ahead
  with the U., and when you'd finished&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dad, I can't stand it any more. Maybe it's all right for some fellows.
  Maybe I'll want to go back some day. But me, I want to get into mechanics. I
  think I'd get to be a good inventor. There's a fellow that would give me
  twenty dollars a week in a factory right now."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;" Babbitt crossed the floor, slowly, ponderously, seeming a
  little old. "I've always wanted you to have a college degree." He
  meditatively stamped across the floor again. "But I've never&mdash;Now, for
  heaven's sake, don't repeat this to your mother, or she'd remove what little
  hair I've got left, but practically, I've never done a single thing I've
  wanted to in my whole life! I don't know 's I've accomplished anything except
  just get along. I figure out I've made about a quarter of an inch out of a
  possible hundred rods. Well, maybe you'll carry things on further. I don't
  know. But I do get a kind of sneaking pleasure out of the fact that you knew
  what you wanted to do and did it. Well, those folks in there will try to
  bully you, and tame you down. Tell 'em to go to the devil! I'll back you.
  Take your factory job, if you want to. Don't be scared of the family. No, nor
  all of Zenith. Nor of yourself, the way I've been. Go ahead, old man! The
  world is yours!"</p>

  <p>Arms about each other's shoulders, the Babbitt men marched into the
  living-room and faced the swooping family.</p>
