<h4>OFF TO SEA</h4>

<p>I don't think my relatives ever knew how amazed I was when I
obtained their consent to go to sea. I chuckled at my good luck, as
they no doubt chuckled at their good riddance.</p>

<p>I had long since made up my mind (or what, at the mature age of
thirteen, I was pleased to call my mind) that I would go to sea. And to
sea I went, knowing little and caring less about those prospective
first few years of hellish servitude, during which experience must be
gained-- experience that, like a corn, had to grow, become hardened,
and most damnably hurt.</p>

<p>My Dad didn't enter into it, as he was settled in New Zealand,
having seen the best days in cotton. In fact we had been "in cotton"
for generations, and I had fully expected that I should have to "follow
in father's footsteps."</p>

<p>For my part the "going to sea" was just a bluff, but it worked. I
hear some say, to my sorrow. Not a bit of it. The sea is a hard,
unrelenting mistress, always ready to whip up the fools (as I was soon
to discover). She tried to drown me several times, yet I beat her; she
nearly broke my neck on more than one occasion, but we still remain the
best of friends, and I never regret that my bluff was called.</p>

<p>I had a distant relative, a one hundred per cent sailor to the tips
of his stub-ended fingers, so I suppose it was only natural that my
near relatives should start me off in his footsteps. The fact remains
that I found myself a brass bound apprentice on board the famous
<i>Primrose Hill</i>, a four-masted barque and three
skysail-yarder.</p>

<p>It was not long before I learned exactly how to throw out my chest
as I described my ship as a "three skysail-yarder." There weren't many
of them about as most owners considered skysails more ornamental than
useful.</p>

<p>If you had been near the half-deck door when one of the Mates sang
out, "Now one of you youngsters, up and stop the main skysail
buntlines," then you would have known just what we boys thought of
them! The sole reason for their existence, in our opinion, lay in the
fact that they formed a ready to hand punishment for first voyagers.
But skysails undoubtedly did give that finishing touch to a ship with
her towering piles of canvas rising, tier on tier, a full two hundred
feet above the deck. Courses-- as the three big lower sails were
called- lower and upper topsails, lower and upper t'gallant sails,
royals, and finally, the boys' pet objection, those skysails. These
were exactly forty-five feet from yard-arm to yard-arm, just half the
length of the main yard; a perfect pocket handkerchief, but making for
perfect symmetry, and taking away that chopped off look that either
stump t'gallant masts, or even royals alone are apt to give. Our great
objection to these sails was there was no way of getting up the final
fifteen feet to this yard except by shinning up the back stays ( the
mast being greased). As far as the royal yard the going was not so bad;
one had the rigging and Jacob's Ladder. But swinging around on a wire
backstay half way to heaven, may have some attraction, but also has its
drawbacks, particularly when she was rolling heavily.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the summit of one's present ambition and standing
there on the footrope of the skysailyard, looking down two hundred odd
feet, always carried a thrill. To a first voyager it seemed
inconceivable that such an almighty spread of canvas, as then lay below
one, should not put that slight strip of deck on its beam ends.</p>

<p>In addition to the square sails, the <i>Primrose Hill</i> carried
fifteen fore and aft sails, in the way of jibs, staysails, spanker and
gaff topsail, each with the definite set purpose of passing its drive
to that long, narrow hull. She was a great ship, and even in the days
when a forest of masts was a common sight in dockland, the tapering
spars of the old <i>Primrose Hill</i> always stood out like one of the
tea clippers of old.</p>

<p>I know the skipper was a mighty proud man, and we boys almost
reverenced him, pacing his lonely beat up and down that poop, lord of
all he surveyed. His slightest word was law absolute and immutable. We
thought that even such as we, might with luck, some day walk the poop
with that deep sea roll. But that was too far in the dim distant future
for boys of our age to consider seriously.</p>

<p>Fourteen years of age found me beating down the channel in the teeth
of a Westerly gale. My first voyage, horribly seasick-- and sick of the
sea. That seemingly objectless and eternal beat from side to side of
the Channel, driving along with every stitch she would stand, trying to
make to the westward. Once in the fog, we almost succeeded in running
down the Royal Sovereign Lightship, and then on the other side, we got
into a jam with the notorious Race of Alderney.</p>

<p>At long last, clear of the Chops of the Channel, we squared away to
a fine Nor'-Nor'West breeze, and tore down through the Roaring Forties
towards good old "flying fish" weather. Shirt and pants the order of
the day, the ship heeling over with a bone in her teeth, ropes fore and
aft cracking like a machine gun as they surged round the green-heart
belaying pins. Day after day, and week after week, snoring along
without touching halyard or sheet; bending fine weather sails,
holystoning decks, scrubbing bright work and painting ship. Never a
lazy moment aboard any sailing ship in fine weather, and the man with
the forenoon or afternoon Trick at the wheel, is the man to be envied.
At night it is the other way about, as the watch on deck can always
find the soft side of a deck plank, for an hour's "caulk."</p>

<p>This was a new world to me, and the first time in my life that I had
seen real sunshine. Steadily the mercury rose as it grew hotter and
hotter, until the pitch boiled up out ot the seams in the deck, to
stick to and blister our still tender feet. It brought other things
also; not exactly out of the deck, but from below deck, in the shape of
rats and cockroaches. Where they all came from goodness knows. We used
to kill rats with belaying pins, and later even became expert in
stamping on them with our bare feet! At night in our bunks, the little
beasts would come and eat our toe-nails, and the hard flesh off the
soles of our feet, and this without awakening us. We knew nothing about
it until we got on deck and put our feet into some salt water. Then we
knew!</p>

<p>Cockroaches near two inches long. These must have come aboard when
she was loading somewhere out East. They had the same happy habit of
browsing on our feet, although not quite to the same extent. For their
benefit we kept a tin of very strong caustic soda and a small brush
with a handle two feet long, and when they started to make themselves
objectionable a dab with the brush settled their hash.</p>

<p>We were soon out of the Forties and into the Trades and it was here
we were to see our first flying fish rising in shoals out of the water
and flying anything up to a quarter of a mile. Some have a spread of
14-16 inches from tip to tip, and to watch them bank and skim the
surface of the water makes it hard to believe they are fish at all. In
fact, one can sympathise with the old lady whose son, returnng from his
first voyage, was telling her yarns, true and stretched, and eventually
told her about flying fish. She replied, "John, there may be mountains
of sugar, and rivers of rum, but you can't tell me that fish fly!"</p>

<p>My life, in common with other first voyagers, was made a misery
until I knew, not only every sail, but every rope used in furling,
setting or trimming, and they average a round dozen per sail, in all
well over five hundred. Even on pitch dark nights and in blinding rain,
you must be able to put your hand on any individual rope, and the
consequence of letting go the wrong one may be pretty disastrous to
both the ship and the culprit.</p>

<p>The Third Mate is usually the boys' mentor, and hikes them away from
their sky-larking in the second dog-watch, to learn the ropes--whence
no doubt the saying originated. A second and third voyager, to say
nothing of the salt-horse A.B. knows his ropes, and that almost by the
feel. These are the men to rely upon when it comes to shortening down
in bad weather.</p>

<p>With fine weather sails bent, and decks like snow we drew down the
Line and into the region of Bonito, Dolphin, and Albacore. Always a
keen fisherman, I was sure of a call if there were fish under the bows,
watch on deck mustn't think of anything so frivolous, but someone
always managed to sneak into the half-deck and give me a shout in hopes
of fish for tea; a mighty welcome addition to the Liverpool pantiles
and salt junk, if there <i>should</i> be any left over from dinner.
Beautiful ships, but badly found.</p>

<p>With us boys, sneaking grub was no crime, it was a religion, and
heaven help the chap that let a chance go by. This led some of us into
queer scrapes, for cooks, and particularly stewards were all out to
catch the hungry hound and haul him before the Captain. On one occasion
we located some biscuits in a spare cabin, and I was told off for
foraging. I got into the cabin and got the biscuits all right, but when
I came to open the door which I had closed so that it couldn't slam
with the roll of the ship, I found I had landed into a trap. The handle
turned, but not the catch; that was the <i>catch</i> so to speak! I got
the port open in hopes of scrambling out on to the cro' jack braces
(ropes that were used to trim that yard) but when I did eventually get
my head and one arm out, I found that not only could I get no further
out but I could not get back, and I had horrible visions of them having
to cut away part of my anatomy, or part of the ship. Anyhow there was
nothing for it but to ignominiously call for help. I did get my head
back, finally with the loss of a bit of scalp,--and though I succeeded
in convincing the Second Mate, who rescued me, that I had walked in my
sleep, it wouldn't go down with the Skipper. Six solid weeks of the
night watch on sentry go, capstan bar on shoulder, and a six foot elm
bar at that!</p>

<p>Another time we discovered a loose plank in the bulkhead of the
lazarette, and, after some nights of hard work, gained through. The
chap told off for the work, Austin, nicknamed Beaky on account of his
nose, was a bit deaf. What he had to do was to get the grub (in this
case onions, to put in our Cracker Hash) and climb up over the cargo
until he came to No. 4 Booby Hatch, the doors of which opened right
facing the half-deck door, inside which we were waiting. He came up all
right, but just as he started to shy the onions across the intervening
four feet of space between hatch and half deck, the Mate must come
along, and, be it known, they were Cabin onions. We sang out cave! when
we heard the Mate coming, but Beaky heard neither us nor the Mate, and
continued to shy the onions. The Mate was bound through the four foot
passage, and, as he turned the corner of the hatch, he stopped one!
Stepping back, he viewed the procedure, no doubt inwardly amused at our
frantic efforts to put Beaky wise. Beaky smiled serenely, and continued
to shy the onions, all of which had to be duly returned, and, in their
place we, once again, took what was coming to us.</p>

<p>However that was all in the day's work, and we would, and frequently
did, risk our necks crawling along cro' jack braces to pinch a bit of
pie or what not from the steward's pantry. Few boys that go to sea are
born to be drowned.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER TWO</h3>

<h4>65 DEGREES SOUTH</h4>

<p>We crossed the Line, with the usual formalities, into the S.E.
Trades, and a long leg down to the Horn. Here a westerly gale drove us
South and further South; colder and colder it grew until we fetched in
amongst the Antarctic ice. I've seen plenty of it since, both down
there and up on the Banks, but one's first sight is always the most
impressive. That long ghostly outline of white, in places blue, and, of
every conceivable shape and size.</p>

<p>By this time we had bogies going--when the sea did not put them
out.</p>

<p>Despite all our efforts we were steadily driven down south until we
eventually fetched the sixty-fifth parallel. The month was June, in
other words, mid-winter. The conditions men had to endure almost beggar
description. Ropes and blocks frozen up, and solid with ice. Sails iron
hard with frozen rain and spray, often ice an inch thick, requiring
belaying pins to break it. I have seen all hands on the topsail yard
for hours on end of a bitter night, blowing a living gale, fighting
with canvas like cast-iron, finger nails turned back and knuckles raw,
battling to get it gathered in and a gasket round. It is difficult to
realise how any human being could survive the days and weeks with never
a dry stitch. Don't think this applied merely to the clothes we wore;
it included both blankets and bedding.</p>

<p>Long before one reaches the latitude of the Horn all maindeck doors
are as near hermetically sealed as is possible. Usually with the close
application of a sheath knife and quantities of rag and paper. One
gains access to the different living quarters, to galley and so forth,
by means of a a skylight; watching one's chance, opening the skylight,
dropping down and closing it again. A breath of the atmosphere in these
close quarters becomes almost as good as a meal. Huge seas, scores of
tons in weight, come thundering on board over the bulwarks, sweeping
anything movable before them. It is often a case of days without a hot
meal.</p>

<p>Added to all this, there is always the intense anxiety as to whether
one is going to happen across an iceberg during the night. The only
means of detecting them, when there is no moon, is from the white foam
at the base of the berg. If there is a moon one can sometimes get a
glint or glimpse of what is called "ice blink." Ice down in these
latitudes becomes more in the nature of ice-fields, and may extend for
miles, and become a veritable island. There is one well-known case of a
sailing ship running into a huge bay with a fair wind, and, finding
herself unable to beat out. Back and forth she thrashed, trying to work
her way clear, till finally she missed stays and crashed on the ice, to
be battered to pieces and all hands lost. Boats are of little or no use
in these conditions, for men can hardly survive on board ship, let
alone in an open boat.</p>

<p>After six weeks battling with Cape Horn Greybeards, as those huge
rollers are called, at last we got our slant. With the wind backing
well to the south-west we crammed on every stitch she would carry in
our endeavour to get up to the north-west and weather that dreaded old
Cape Stiff. There was every indication that we should make it, and be
able to stretch away for fine weather. Lower t'gallant sails and
t'gallant staysails set. Steering full-and-by, with all sails drawing
strong, her nose pointing well up to windward, everyone's spirits rose
with every mile reeled off. Every man and boy counted the hours to when
he would be able to hang out his dunnage and have some dry clothing,
though it was still a bit too soon to be looking forward to real
warmth, but that would come later. All we longed for from the bottom of
our hearts was that the wind would hold and not head us off by hauling
any more to the westward. The very first question asked each time the
watch was called was "How's the wind?" and it was a cheery crowd that
answered to the names called over at each relief. Now another
forty-eight or sixty hours at the most would see us with old Stiff
astern, and we would be safe.</p>

<p>That night we were still snoring along, dark as pitch but with every
stitch on her that she could possibly bear. There <i>was</i> the risk
of hitting an iceberg, yes, but one that we were all willing to take.
Still, with the sea that was running, there was every chance of seeing
it before hitting and in good time to either go about, or run her away.
However, it was not to be. Our luck was out, and a long way out. Soon
after the watch had been relieved at midnight, the wind to our great
disappointment started to fall light. Nothing too bad in that, so long
as it did not head us. Better much, than in blowing up one of those
seemingly eternal gales with which we were absolutely fed-up.</p>

<p>Lighter and lighter the wind fell, and to an extraordinary degree
baffling, a thing most uncommon in those latitutes. You expect, and do
get, baffling winds in the tropics but not down in the sixties. The
cold became intense, in fact piercing. Not a great deal of difference
from what we had had, yet somehow it was a distinctive cold and it
seemed to have a dry penetrating drive with it. We certainly connected
the cold with ice, but not seriously. It was the vagaries of the wind
we couldn't understand, and no wonder.</p>

<p>At four bells as the wheel and look-out was being relieved, the two
look-out men stood for a few minutes talking and discussing the rotten
luck in losing the wind. The man relieving was a real old-timer, and
presently he walked up to the weather rail of the foc's'tlehead, and
sort of stuck his nose up into the wind. Suddenly he whipped round and
bellowed out, "Ice right ahead sir." Instinctively the Second Mate, aft
on the poop, gave the order, "Put your helm down and shake her up,"
with the idea of taking the wind out of the sails and the way off the
ship until he could get a clear grasp of the situation.</p>

<p>The vital question was, in what direction did the ice extend. Were
we to windward, or to leeward of the main body? As she ran up into the
wind, both lookout men saw the ice still coming into sight ahead, and
on the weather bow. Old Heron, with his vast experience, and knowing
that everything right ahead and to some distance on the bow was
completely blotted out by the sails from the Second Mate on the poop,
now roared out, "Put your helm up, sir. The ice is to windward."</p>

<p>On a sailing ship you get to know your man to the very fibre of his
being, and the Second Mate <i>knew</i> Heron and ordered the helm "Hard
up." It was a big risk to take, for if once she filled again and got
way on her, and the ice should chance to be leeward as well as windward
then, we should undoubtedly strike and sink. There being little wind,
however, she payed off slowly.</p>

<p>The Captain was now on deck and quickly rapped out his orders. "All
hands on deck. Stand by the braces." Sure enough, old Heron was right,
and by now we could all see the ghostly and threatening outline of a
massive berg extending as far as the eye could see. Furthermore, it was
this monstrous berg that had been taking the wind out of our sails.
This we realised and with the realisation the knowledge that it must be
the father of all bergs, if it was responsible for the extraordinary
baffling of the wind, which we had now experienced for over four hours,
and during which time we must, in the darkness have been sailing
parallel along this block of Antartic. (sic)</p>

<p>Quickly we rounded in the weather braces in the hopes of filling on
her and making an offing. We must take the chance as to whether we had
run into an ice bay in the dark, for it must be remembered we could not
see more than quarter of a mile, and the ice was less than <i>half</i>
that distance from us. At one time just before she commenced to gather
way and draw off we were no more than a hunded yards from that towering
cliff of ice which looked as if our yardarms were going to touch. Being
right under the lee, the wind was utterly unreliable, and kept catching
her aback and drifting her nearer and nearer those threatening white
walls of ice.</p>

<p>An added anxiety in our minds as to whether there were any
protruding ledges below the water which might hold us below the water
line and sink us. Goodness knows what the temperature was at this time.
Fortunately our anxiety blotted out all sense of the cold, except when
we tried to use our hands. Everything that carried or showed the
slightest moisture, was all just solid ice, clothing included.</p>

<p>Steadily, inch by inch, we clawed off and, at last gained sea room;
then we hove-to till daylight broke and we should be able to see where
the ice extended and what was the best hope of saving the ship. With
the first streak of dawn it was easy to see what a narrow shave it had
been, and, with the increasing daylight, the cliffs of ice just
extended and extended. As the light became better and better till with
the full day there was revealed an impenetrable wall of ice for close
on fifteen miles astern, and more than double that distance ahead. As
it turned out, we sailed the best part of two solid days before we
could safely round the end of that island of ice. But, what was worse,
we were all the time slowly but surely being forced off our course, and
away to the eastward; for ever lessening our chances of rounding the
Horn on this leg.</p>

<p>A magnificent sight , cruising slowly along those blue-black cliffs.
Pinnacles, bays, chasms and cathedral like structures, huge ravines and
bridges, bridges of ice, looking for all the world as if they had built
by some clever engineers, and would have done credit to them at that.
Unfortunately we were in no mood at that moment to appreciate these
beauties. Curses, deep, sincere, and universal were hurled at this one
insurmountable bar, which prevented us from stretching away with a fair
wind to fine weather.</p>

<p>At long last when we did finally get round the ice, it was too light
to weather the old Cape, we once again, we heard that well-known order,
"All hands wear ship," and commenced another long leg to the
southward.</p>

<p>It might be proverbial amongst sailing-ship men of those days that
one was not entitled to the name of sailor until the Horn had been
rounded at least three or four times. I know I felt all of a sailor
after rounding it once. Six weeks to the day, from the time we first
made the Horn bound south, till we again brought it abeam bound
north.</p>

<p>A good clean run up through Trades and Tropics soon removed all
traces of our trials down south, whilst with all the goodwill in the
world we said good-bye to those harbingers of high latitudes,
albatrosses, Cape pigeons, Molly hawks and Mother Carey's chickens.</p>

<p>Heavy weather-sails were sent down and fine weather canvas bent in
place. Running gear re-rove, and heavy weather spare spar-lashings
removed. All dunnage (Anglice, clothing and bedding) out on deck drying
and airing. Everyone revelling in the sun and even welcoming the
bubbling pitch, though it should stick to our toes.</p>

<p>The very ship herself seemed to spring into greater life as the
flying kites were once again hoisted and set; each adding the urge and
drive which a few weeks later carried us through the Golden Gates of
San Francisco, on to the broad, smooth waters of the Sacramento.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THREE</h3>

<h4>'FRISCO IN THE EIGHTIES</h4>

<p>What a strange mixture we found in that city of mushroom growth.
Beautiful broad streets and magnificent buildings, but almost entirely
without law or order,--unless you could pay for it. One section of the
city, known as Chinatown, was literally a young China. Rarely, if ever
did any white man attempt this locality at night time. We boys cared
little about the reputation of the place; in fact we did not realise
the perfectly appalling reputation it bore, and we spent lots of our
time hunting up curios from John Chinaman. The great fire of San
Francisco has cleared away this well-known landmark, and the Chinese
are scattered to the four winds of heaven. Certainly one does not find
them now in 'Frisco. Whether 'Frisco is any better off without her
young Chinatown than with, is an open question. For my part I much
prefer John Chinaman to many other races. At least his word is his
bond, and you can rely on it to the bitter end. Get him to give you his
brief "Can do" and you need no attorneys, stamps nor seals.</p>

<p>'Frisco at this time, had the honour of bearing the worst reputation
of any sea port in the world for lawlessness, not excepting New York.
It was bad enough for the landsman to be on the streets at night, if it
was even suspected that he was carrying more than a very few dollars.
Even in broad daylight it was no uncommon thing for a man to be
sandbagged and robbed. Judge then, what it was for a sailor coming out
of the shipping office, <i>known</i> to have his pay-day in his pocket.
He was lucky if he could get as far as the nearest Post Office, always
allowing he had the sense to go there, which was seldom.</p>

<p>The water front of 'Frisco was held and run by a lot of soulless
crimps. These human vultures didn't wait for a man to get as far as the
Shipping Office; in fact they were indifferent as to whether a man was
even paying off or not. All <i>they</i> wanted was his body, and they
would fight amongst themselves for possession. Red Jake for a long time
held unquestioned sway. He derived his name from his lurid complexion
and crimson nose; one might even include his language,--it suited his
name.</p>

<p>A ship arriving within the Golden Gates (was there ever such a
misnomer?) was at once overrun by a horde of these wretched crimps'
runners. The men might be on the capstan heaving in the tow rope, and
the crimps would just join up and heave round also on the capstan bars,
hauling out of their pockets flasks of whisky, and once a man has
accepted a drink, he is theirs,--and it was more than another crimp's
life was worth to alienate that man's affections.</p>

<p>Red Jake would have perhaps half a dozen of the toughest runners to
each ship, and so held a monopoly. After the drink, the sailor chap is
given money. No receipt or anything, is asked in return, but <i>now</i>
they have bought him, and he must be slick indeed, to get out of their
toils. He goes ashore that night under the wing of the crimp's runner
to have a good time. He has everything he asks for, and eventually goes
to the boarding house that every crimp keeps.</p>

<p>If there is a ship ready to sail and short of a crew, he will be one
of them. Heavily doped, his body is delivered on board and a receipt
taken, which in turn, is cashed for a month's pay, deducted from the
sailor boy's pay sheet; having already sacrificed all his earnings of
the outward passage.</p>

<p>Who profits?</p>

<p>The crimp gets a month's pay. The shipowner gets the whole of the
outward passage's pay, and the Captain gets his crew, and, let it be
known, he will get them no other way.</p>

<p>Who should kick?</p>

<p>The skinflint shipowner, thousands of miles away, lining his pockets
and increasing his dividends?</p>

<p>Not he.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the skipper with a conscience, who manages to keep his
crew together, will get no bouquets when he arrives home and faces
"ship's expenses" at the office.</p>

<p>The 'Frisco police also got their rake off, according to a printed
and accepted schedule, agreed with the boarding house runners.</p>

<p>I am glad to say our Skipper was one with a conscience. I'll go
further and say, such men were not difficult to find in British ships.
He gave the crew to understand they would get money out of his own
pocket the moment the ship was fast, and if they deserted that night,
well, he would be the loser. He told them, "Go ashore, and have a good
time. But for God's sake men don't let those crimps get hold of you."
We did lose a couple of men before we left. Men we could afford to
lose, as a matter of fact, but of the real good crowd, we lost
none.</p>

<p>Of course it was good to be ashore for a time. To stretch our legs,
and feed the inner man, and see the sights. What sights some of them
were!!! Old Dupont Street with its green shutters and painted hags.</p>

<p>The Underground rabbit warren that honeycombed Chinatown.</p>

<p>Beach Street on the river edge with its rows of Dives, where more
men went in than ever came out.</p>

<p>Hard, bitter hard, though ship life often was, yet we were glad to
see the Golden Gates, with all they stood for, fading away and finally
disappearing below the horizon. At least the sea was clean.</p>

<p>The only good thing about 'Frisco as far as I, a first voyager with
an eternal hunger, could see, was the biscuits. "'Frisco biscuits" are
known the world over.Big, crisp and eatable. A good six inches across,
and even the ship's margarine could not altogether spoil their flavour.
Why the food, supplied by the British shipowners should have been so
notoriously bad, barely sufficient to keep body and soul lashed
together, seems inconceivable. Ships were paying, and paying well, yet
they screw the old salt horse shellback down to the last ounce--and a
poor one at that. In fact, the outstanding feature of my first voyage
seems to have been the state of semi-starvation we boys lived in, until
we got the 'Frisco biscuits.</p>

<p>One of the squarest meals I ever remember enjoying was on an
occasion, in the port we had just left. Standing outside a restaurant,
a very small and very hungry boy, just thinking what I could do with a
dollar and some of the good things in front of me--if I had the chance.
When a voice with the broad, drawling Western accent spoke from away up
above me, "Say, Sonny, could you go a feed?" I looked up to see a man
about six feet five inches, and big in proportion, wearing the rough
rig of a miner or rancher, just up to town. Could I go a feed! when
money was doled out to all and sundry at the munificent rate of a
dollar a week! A.B.'s, apprentices, or petty officers, it was just the
same, though why on earth we should not have been allowed to have some
of the money that was already ours, heaven and the owners alone
knew.</p>

<p>He took me in and gave me the meal of my young life. Lashings of ham
and eggs (a sailor's staple diet when ashore) cups of thick chocolate
and apple pie. He just grinned as it all disappeared, till, at last,
despite his earnest persuasion, I could eat no more.</p>

<p>Next day he was down on board with pockets full of apples, asking
for "that youngster with the gaff-topsail collar." Western
generosity!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER FOUR</h3>

<h4>FLYING FISH WEATHER</h4>

<p>We left the Golden Gates behind us homeward bound, with a cargo of
grain. About half way down to the Horn we discovered that she had
sprung a leak somewhere. We could tell this by the frightful stink
coming up from below. Rotting grain has worse contemporaries, but they
are not so easy to find. Evidently there was water getting in somewhere
on the starboard side, for that was obviously where the stench came
from.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to open up the hatches, and break down.
Fortunately we were still in fine weather so we could pile the decks
with sacks of grain and loose wet grain laid out drying. The leak was
located and found due to a bit of flint getting into the red lead
packing around one of the side ports!</p>

<p>Poor old Chips, he was for the carpet all right. A few thousand
pounds worth of damage done, all on account of a little stone! All the
same, it was lucky it happened where it did. Ships are known to have
had their sides burst out by the swelling grain, when the leak could
not be got at.</p>

<p>It was shortly after we had the grain stowed again that Olsen, the
Swede got moonstruck, through sleeping out on deck in the full rays of
the tropic moon. He woke up, one middle watch, to muster with the rest,
and at the sight of him, with his face all twisted on one side,
everyone burst out laughing. Poor devil, he didn't know what was the
matter. It was full moon, and as light as day; one could easily see to
read a book by the light, yet old Olsen went stumbling about the decks,
as if it were pitch dark. As it turned out, he thought that it was
dark, and that gave us the first inkling that something had gone wrong.
We heard him say, half to himself, "<i>Gosh!</i> it's dark," and then
someone asked him what he meant, and it came out that not only was his
face all twisted up, but he could not see his hand in front of him.
When daylight came he was all right, but as soon as it got a bit dusk,
he was finished. He got over it to a certain extent before we arrived
home, but he never fully recovered his sight at night time.</p>

<p>Most sailors have a hobby of some sort--making mats, carving models
out of wood, with beautifully cut sails, thin as a wafer, and bellying
out in the most natural way. Olsen's strong point was making planes for
planing wood--Spoon planes, Jack planes, and all sorts of planes. It
was just marvellous to sit and watch him fashioning them out of pieces
of hard wood he brought away with him, fitting the irons and polishing
them off. Most Swedes are good carpenters, and, though an A.B. he was a
jolly good chippy man. After he got twisted up, he just moped, and
would do nothing. It was pitiful to see him feeling his way round the
decks when it was light enough for the rest of us to pick up a pin.</p>

<p>On a long sailing ship voyage, each man knows the other better than
he knows himself. Funny little characteristics develop. He tells a bit
here, and a bit there, until, whether he likes it or not, you can piece
his life story together, like fitting a jig-saw puzzle.</p>

<p>Knut, the Dane, had been a whaler in Nova Scotia, and had killed a
man with a harpoon. He never told us in so many words, and of course,
his secret was quite safe.</p>

<p>If it had happened in a Yankee whaler, he would not have had to
bother--always supposing no one else had caught him out. It would
merely have resolved into a matter of paying so many dollars in to the
right quarter, and nothing more would have been heard of it. But, as he
came under British law, it was a different matter, and he was lucky to
change over at sea, as he did, and eventually work his way back to
Denmark. Knut wasn't his name, we all knew that. He hadn't meant to
kill the man; in fact, the man went for Knut with the steering oar,
just when Knut was going to make his strike, and, as he turned suddenly
away from the whale to defend himself, the boat gave a lurch, and he
drove the harpoon into the steersman's stomach. It <i>might</i> have
washed in a Court of Law, but for the bad blood that was known to exist
between the two. Wisely, or unwisely, he took the chance when it was
offered of getting right back home.</p>

<p>It wasn't until the passage home that we could get him to even take
a shot with the harpoon. He certainly was an artist with it, and three
out of four times he would hit a chip of wood thrown from the bowsprit
end. In fact, I saw him put the harpoon through a three-inch rope
grummet, three times in succession, and this with the ship laying over,
and doing a good seven knots. He could pick up a porpoise every time,
and that is not easy, for there is only one place where you can harpoon
a porpoise and be certain that it is going to hold.</p>

<p>Lying becalmed one day, a whole shoal of these greybellies came
thundering over the horizon; each one anything up to ten feet long, all
leaping straight up and flinging themselves sideways, landing flat on
to the surface, with a report like a 4.7 gun. There were thousands and
tens of thousands of them. Thunder was mild compared with the row. They
covered, at a rough guess, a rectangle, about half a mile long, and
five hundred yards wide. The sea was like glass, and when they were
first sighted, we could just see a patch of foam, growing rapidly
bigger and bigger: then bodies shooting up in the air, the roar growing
louder and louder, until we couldn't hear each other speak.</p>

<p>The average weight must have been well over a ton and a half. The
one Knut nailed was purposely a small one, otherwise the line would not
have held him. Of course it would have been a different matter if Knut
had been in a small boat and so could have let the porpoise tow him
before the line ran out. As it was, the 2 1/2 inch rope was taxed
pretty severly when hauling it up by sheer brute force, tail first, to
the cat-head.</p>

<p>I was told the wind always came from the direction where a shoal of
porpoises was heading. But first voyagers are fair game for all sorts
of yarns; one remembers some, and if wise, believes about half of what
one remembers. All the same, sailors do believe the wind will come from
the direction indicated by porpoises. Personally I think they gather
together from far and wide at certain times, simply to migrate; going
thousands of miles to fresh hunting grounds.</p>

<p>They jump out of the water and drop smack on to it again partly for
sheer sport, and partly in an endeavour to knock off suckers, Anyhow,
they're good eating, and a mighty welcome change from sailing-ship salt
horse where the fat is often going, or gone, green--and that's no
exaggeration.</p>

<p>The <i>Crofton Hall</i> had cholera break out through eating some
such junk and lost half her crew before she could get back to Calcutta.
Admittedly the stuff had been slowly going rotten lying in the harness
cask for two months under a tropical sun. Still, they had the usual
sailor's choice; eat it or leave it.</p>

<p>Fish hung up in the light of the moon will go the same way and must
on no account be touched. If the moon does get at it you see the whole
fish, or what may be left of it, become phosphorescent. That is the
danger signal, and I've never seen enyone hardy enough, even amongst
sailing-ship men, to tackle it after that.</p>

<p>Neither will sailors touch a fish that has come out of what is
called "Blood Water." This is a case when the sea turns deep red, often
crimson, in the sun. Really it's nothing but countless millions of
animalculae like cochineal. You will be slipping though beautifully
blue water (never seen within two hundred miles of our English
coast)when suddenly you will run into this Blood Water (it does look
just like blood) and may so continue for a couple of days.</p>

<p>As for the yarn about never eating fish out of it; well I've never
seen fish in it, and that's a pretty sound reason to my mind.</p>

<p>Sailing ship life, even on one's first voyage is cram full of
incidents, but they are irrelevant, and would fill a good sized book in
themselves.</p>

<p>At long last we arrived in Liverpool, just a few days short of a
year from the time we left; and such was my first voyage in sail.</p>

<hr><a name="ch05"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER FIVE</h3>

<h4>THE "HOLT HILL"</h4>

<p>For some reason I changed over to the <i>Holt Hill</i>, sister ship
to the <i>Primrose Hill</i>, and of the same Line. My cousin was Third
Mate; I was then second voyage apprentice, and beginning to feel my
feet. We were bound for Rio, and proud to sail under Captain "Jock"
Sutherland, one of the greatest crackers-on out of Liverpool; in fact,
he made a boast that he never allowed a ship to pass him with any of
his sails furled. He certainly was a sailor to his finger tips; and it
was great to see him lying that ship over in half a gale of wind, with
scupper holes and wash-ports well under water, the water even swirling
through the sheave-holes half way up the bulwarks; this used to thrill
us boys to the bone.</p>

<p>He knew exactly, to the last ounce, what she would carry, and woe
betide anyone who voiced a thought that sail might be shortened. To
first voyagers it was pretty terrifying I'll admit, for many a time and
aften it seemed as though nothing could save the ship from going over
on her beam ends, or, alternatively, the masts being taken out of
her.</p>

<p>On one occasion old Jock heard some of the crew cursing at the way
he was carrying on. He just went down below, and arrived back on deck,
with a camp chair and a revolver, and dared any man to even whisper
about shortening sail, much less touch a halyard. He followed this up
with a threat that, unless they went about their work and stopped their
grousing, he would "put the helm up and sail the whole damn lot of you
to hell." And, knowing the man, I wouldn't have put it past him. It was
not exactly that he was altogether a daredevil in his cracking-on, it
was just sheer knowledge of his ship, and confidence in what she could
stand.</p>

<p>Beyond minor incidents that will happen to any good cracker-on, old
Jock had, up to that time, run free of any serious smash up, but this
voyage proved to be his undoing. The first bad break (and, as it turned
out afterwards, there were to be three) was off the Western Isles, one
filthy dirty night; carrying on as usual to the last ounce, under six
t'gallant sails, when really she should have been under six
topsails--backstays like harpstrings, and every rope straining to its
limit. Suddenly a man got washed overboard from the lee braces. In
response to old Jock's whip crack orders, we dropped the upper
t'gallant yards with a run and let fly the lower t'gallant sheets, as
he flung the ship up in the wind, nearly taking the masts out of her,
but the case was utterly hopeless.</p>

<p>We even got a boat away, by sheer good luck, but in the pitch
darkness, and in that sea, it was a wonder we didn't lose both boat and
boat's crew as well.</p>

<p>It was no fault of old Sutherland's that the man went overboard,
except that the ship had far too much canvas on her--but who would
blame him for that: All sailors know the danger in shipping a lee sea.
Each man must look out for himself. On the other hand, to be dubbed a
cracker-on would be the ambition of every skipper worth his salt. We
lost our man, but he was the first and last to lose his life, from
being washed overboard whilst under Sutherland's command.</p>

<p>The second misfortune came about just outside Rio, off Cape Frio, at
eight o'clock one morning, driving hard as usual, every stitch of
canvas set. A sudden squall sent the ship heeling over, ropes and
chains cracking, yard parrels groaning, till she was ripping it up like
the proverbial Flying Dutchman.</p>

<p>Whether what happened was due to a sudden shift of wind, or to the
skipper giving the order to luff, and the man at the wheel giving her
too much helm, was never known--(Sutherland would never explain, nor
make any attempt to justify himself)--but the fact remains without a
moment's warning, we were caught back and then a moment later, the
sails suddenly filled again and twisted the fore and main t'gallant
masts clean out of her.</p>

<p>That meant both fore and main t'gallant, royal and skysail masts
with all their attendant yards and gear, came crashing down on or near
the desk. No one was hurt, marvellous to relate, though the main
skysail yard dropped and hung within a few feet of a bunch of us boys,
who, despite the fact that it was our watch below, had turned out to
see the fun, and to be perfectly frank, in the hopes that something
<i>would</i> happen.</p>

<p>It did, and no one had another meal, or spell for twenty-four hours.
The gale, which had been brewing, and of which the squall was the fore
runner, came down on us, and did its best to put us under altogether.
Nothing but the superhuman efforts of Mates and crew saved the ship (as
it turned out, only for a later fate). It was in emergencies like this,
that one appreciated a British crowd. As a rule they are the greatest
grumblers on earth, but you can always rely on them when the time comes
and you are in a tight corner; which you can't on Dutchmen--the broad
term applied to all Continental foreigners.</p>

<p>On one ship of which I was Second Mate, the Mate was a Dutchman
(actually a Swede) and had a watch of his own kidney. Down round the
Horn one night, with the Skipper laid up, the Mate had to "wear ship"
himself, an "all hands" job. I had to take his Watch at the Main
Braces, and the Third Mate take mine at the Cro'jack Braces. Wearing
Ship is a ticklish job at the best of times, particularly the bracing
up when she comes to. At the crucial moment, the whole Watch got a dose
of sheer funk and cowered at the braces, and when I got amongst them
with hands and feet, cursing them to all eternity, they simply
vanished, and hid in what they considered safety.</p>

<p>We saved her, but only because half the British Watch broke off and
did the "Dutchmen's" job at the Main, whilst the other half of the
Watch carried on at the Mizzen.</p>

<p>Having, at last, cleared the wreckage of masts, yards, and sails,
cut away the last wire back stay, saved what we could, and let the
remainder go by the board, we squared away the remaining yards, and
limped into Rio.</p>

<hr><a name="ch06"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER SIX</h3>

<h4>RIO AND REVOLUTIONS</h4>

<p>Rio is a marvellous harbour, second only to Sydney, and at that time
full of sailing ships, though many of them were swinging to an anchor
without a soul on board. Cholera and smallpox were at their worst, with
little facilities and less energy on the part of the natives to hold
the disease in check. Deaths were averaging about two hundred a day
ashore, whilst "Dead boats" continually patrolled the harbour with
their gruesome cargoes collected from the various ships. Still, there
was plenty of enjoyment to be got out of life, and with the usual
youthful indifference, one paid little heed to the horrors around.</p>

<p>I cannot say the British were ever favourites in Rio, and little
blame can be attached to the natives, for the ill-concealed hate with
which they regarded us. "Incidents" happened pretty frequently,
important and unimportant; many of them were just skylarks. One night
we had been ashore on duty, and returning without the Captain we were
chased by a police boat; owing to the revolution the inhabitants were
indulging at the time no one was allowed on the water after sunset.</p>

<p>Ours was a six-oared mahogany gig, very light and very fast, and we
led that police boat a dance round that harbour they were not likely to
forget. All they wanted was to know which ship we belonged to, so that
they could drop on the Skipper, and that was the very thing we were
determined they should not find out. They tried a few shots with their
revolvers, but we knew they didn't mean to hit us. The result was, they
pulled and we pulled, but their crew had not got their muscles and
sinews developed in the hard school of a British sailing ship. After a
couple of hours they had to give it up, absolutely exhausted, and next
morning yet another complaint was carefully noted--and filed--by that
tactful warden of British prestige: the good old British Consul.</p>

<p>On another occasion a British Man-o'-Warsman had a knife stuck into
him, and, as a result, died on his ship. The British Fleet out there at
that time, consisted of two comparatively small ships, but what it
lacked in size, the Admiral certainly made up for in grit and
determination. Having ineffectually demanded the surrender of the
murderer, after forty-eight hours he stood over, opposite the town,
cleared for action, and landed an armed party. We boys were in at the
steps, in our own ship's boats at the time, and nothing would please us
but we must abandon our boats, and follow the naval party up to the
town to see the fun. No resistance at all was made to the Bluejackets,
who marched right up to the jail, extracted the murderer, put him on
board the cruiser, and sailed out of the harbour, to return a few hours
later with his remains swinging at the yard arm! Later the body was
lowered, and landed at the steps, and left for the authorities to
collect.</p>

<p>Pretty high handed, I'll admit, but the British were both feared and
respected in those days.</p>

<p>Another time, the Port Authorities refused, for some reason to give
the <i>Thetis</i>, a full rigged British ship, her papers, and after
delaying her for a week, the Captain threatened to take her out without
papers. The authorities ashore told him that they would blow her out of
the water, if he attempted to pass the forts. He threatened to go and
fetch the British Fleet (consisting of these two small cruisers) and
turn them loose. Their reply was that they would blow the British Fleet
out of the water also.</p>

<p>This appeared to be good enough to be getting on with, so,
commandeering a steam launch, the Captain carried the glad tidings to
the Admiral--who was cruising outside the harbour, not wishing to get
mixed up in a revolution then in progress, and by which they hoped to
unseat Don Pedro. The two British cruisers came in; made fast on either
side of the British sailing ship, and told the Captain to heave up his
anchor. Then steamed with him out of the harbour. We cheered ourselves
pretty well hoarse at the success of this manoeuvre. Needless to say,
not a shot was fired from the forts.</p>

<p>A common form of amusement amongst us boys, in which the <i>Holt
Hill</i> played a leading part, was swimming around "ship visiting." In
most ships swimming over the side was absolutely prohibited; in others,
only allowed for half an hour or so in the evening, with very strict
precautions, such as boats in the water, and look-outs for sharks. Old
Jock Sutherland was a sport to his finger tips, and simply left us to
use our own good common sense. So when the work of the day was over,
decks had been washed,--and ourselves--tea finished, then, in the cool
of the evening, over the side we would go and swim away to the next
ship. If nobody was watching, their boys would come over the side and
join us, and so we would go on from ship to ship, until perhaps close
on fifty of us, would be swimming and singing round the harbour, in
water like warm milk. Sharks are cowards, anyway, always excepting
tiger sharks, and as it turned out we were perfectly safe and never
lost a soul.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, a fish that is far more dangerous than a shark
in Rio harbour is a Blanket Fish, often called a Sun Fish; sometimes
misnamed a Devil Fish. It frequently lies asleep on the surface,
covering an area of anything up to ten or fifteen square yards. One of
these fish is apt to heave itself almost bodily out of the water, and
land on top of its objective, which may be a man swimming. They have
only one motion, and that is forward, so there is not much danger
really,--providing that you are fairly quick in the uptake, dodge
sideways, and don't lose your head.</p>

<p>Coming off in the gig one night, we ran right up one of these chaps,
much to the annoyance of the Skipper. It was shortly after midnight and
pitch dark. I think the Skipper had had a pretty good time; anyhow, he
was feeling quite pleased with himself. We pulled six oars, and the
custom is to judge your distance from the gangway, say a hundred feet,
and on the order "give her weigh" get in about a half a dozen good
strokes, then smartly toss the oars, while the boat with her own
impetus, runs alongside. We had just given her the half dozen, when she
ran her nose high and dry on one of these great slabs of sleeping fish,
lying on the surface. He awakened in a hurry, and, tossing his stern,
dived down. Being a long narrow boat, <i>our</i> stern was already well
down, and as the result of the Sun Fish's kick up, the skipper found
himself sitting up to his armpits in water. On our lives, we dared not
laugh, so we just hustled him up on board, out of the way, and howled
our heads off.</p>

<p>Another amusement for the boys forming the boats' crews from the
different ships in harbour, was to muster up at the landing steps
ashore, and, leaving one in charge of all the boats, do a cruise round
the market, buying what we couldn't steal. I dare say we were a bit of
a trial, and the natives certainly did not overtax their patience with
us; in fact they often used to turn out <i>en masse</i> and kick us out
of the market. I don't blame them altogether, but when, on occasions,
they drew knives, then it got beyond a joke. One time they chased us
half way across the square before we got reinforcements from the boats
with stretchers, and we were able to return their good wishes-- and
quite a good account we gave. This time I not only collected two very
nice little cuts, but actually left a small piece of flesh, off one
hand, on the ground. Several of us had got cut about, when, to add
insult to injury, the mounted police turned up, but charged us boys, if
you please, instead of charging the mob!</p>

<p>Rio is also rather noted for its podgy little bum-boats, which
cruise round the harbour visiting the ships, and are anxiously looked
for by the hungry hordes of apprentices. In exchange for money, or a
shirt if you hadn't cash--as was usually the case, you got glorious
bread, coffee, oranges, bananas, and "alligator" pears, as they are now
known, though their proper name is Avocada. This sort of trading is
stopped by the Mates if it can possibly be detected. But when the sun
shines, and a fellow is hungry, seaboots and thick underclothing seem
quite superfluous. Many's the chap that has left Rio, bound round the
Horn, with barely enough clothes for tropical weather, let alone the
rigours of Cape Stiff. To have been round the Horn a few times you are
a "sailor," but to have been round without seaboots, you are a real
"hard case."</p>

<p>We rigged up stump t'gallant masts in Rio for the simple reason, I
suppose, they had no spars long enough for t'gallant, royal, and
skysail masts. They were terrible misfits, but the best we could get
from a town in the turmoil of eternal revolutions. The sails were of
No.1 canvas and had forty-two feet of a drop. Lowered down and clewed
up. At least they were supposed to lower down, but when needed never
would, so it was usually a case of "lower away t'gallant halyards,"
and, as nothing ever happened, "Haul taut and clew up." Finally we
would have to take up a downhaul, and pull the infernal yard down by
brute force, on to the lifts. That done, it was "up aloft and furl
them"--a sixty by forty sail, No. 1 canvas, and wet at that. It was
more like trying to roll up a piece of rhino hide than anything else I
can imagine. You manage to beat a crinkle in the belly, so that you can
get all your fingers fastened on to it, then, all together, you haul
and tuck that particular bit of sail under your stomach and lie on it
hard. All this time the sail is banging and thrashing about, and you
are balanced on the foot rope, so named because it is under your feet,
and all else there is under you is the deep blue sea, or worse still,
the deck, if you do come down. After two or three bights of the sail
have been tucked under each man, someone may inadvertantly ease up, or
the sail will give an extra kick, and away goes the whole damn lot, and
you start all over again--if you've been lucky enough to catch the
jackstay in front of you as the sail went bellying up over your head.
How heartily we cursed those sails!</p>

<p>Finally, with all our ballast on board, a round thousand tons of
sharp edged granite, every ounce of which we had man-handled from
lighters to the hold, we were ready for sea. With sails bent, tug
alongside, we hove up and said "so long" to them and their oranges,
their cholera and their revolutions.</p>

<p>With a fair wind and a light ship we sailed out of Rio harbour bound
for Calcutta--or so we thought.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER SEVEN</h3>

<h4>SMALLPOX</h4>

<p>It was almost a dead beat in the teeth of the Trades, so we reached
away to forty odd degrees south, where we hoped to pick up the
prevailing westerly wind, and stretch away for the Cape. We had to send
down the mizzen skysailyard and unbend the mizzen royal staysail, as it
gave her far too much canvas aft with only stump t'gallant masts
forward; in fact, with the mizzen royal, and the wind anywhere abaft
the beam, it took two hands at the wheel to keep her from broaching-to
at the best of times. Whereas ordinarily with a ship of her class you
could steer with one hand and a few spokes of the wheel. And, take it
from me, to have in your hands the eight foot wheel (diameter, not
circumference) and a twenty-five hundred ton ship, and she with a bone
in her teeth, is a thing never to be forgotten. You can "feel" her just
as closely as you can a horse with the most delicate mouth, and to be a
helmsman worthy of the name, you must know what she is going to do
before she does it. She lifts to this sea, straghtens herself up, and
goes down to the next, with the unmistakable motion that tells you she
is going to run up in the wind on the following sea. If you don't get
the helm against her before she does it, up she comes with all the
upper sails shaking in the wind and the Mate howling out to know,
"Where the hell are you going to, you soldier?"</p>

<p>Although we had left Rio, we were not to forget it in a hurry.</p>

<p>We had been out about a fortnight, when some of the crew commenced
to go down with some sort of sickness. The first chap we said was
loafing, until he died. That's always the verdict on a sailing ship,
anyway. A man is invariably "mouching" until he dies, and then we say,
"Oh, he must have been bad after all." It was smallpox.</p>

<p>Old Sails was the first to go under, and even then, I don't think we
were by any means sure what we were up against. No medicine, and no
doctor, of course; in fact, the last medicine on board, which consisted
of half a cup of castor oil, was drunk by one of the patients in
mistake for water. As there was nothing to check it, we just had to
rely upon our cast iron constitutions and stick it out. I seemed to be
immune both from smallpox and yellow fever. I once had a chap die in my
arms of Yellow Jack, and I used to wear a fur coat belonging to one of
our smallpox convalescents. He used to wear it during the day, and I
borrowed at night! I'll admit I wasn't popular with the watch whilst I
did wear it.</p>

<p>Twice I read the burial service, or such parts as I could find, in a
gale of wind when the Mate couldn't leave the poop. Sometimes we
couldn't get the body over the rail,--then it was beastly.</p>

<p>We reached away down into high latitudes in the hopes of freezing it
out. This was a mixed advantage, as on one hand we had to shorten down,
and keep her shortened down, for the simple reason that if we did crowd
the canvas on, we had not the hands to take it in, if it came on to
blow. This left us battling around under six topsails instead of
stretching out for the Cape under full sail.</p>

<p>After several memorable weeks of struggle under appalling
conditions, we at last got our anchor down in Capetown Quarantine
ground. Made up our losses and left again. I think everyone was glad to
see the last of us, as the reason for our being there had somehow
leaked out ashore, although, by that time we had lived down the
scourge.</p>

<p>From time immemorial sailing ships have what is termed "Run their
Easting Down." That is, after rounding or leaving the Cape, they ran on
a parallel of latitude, and sometimes worked south, keeping down till
they reach St. Paul's or thereabouts. The prevailing winds are westerly
and strong, and St. Paul's serves to check chronometers for longitude,
and the run north to the East Indies. We had left Rio in ballast, and
mighty little of that, and therefore were in no case for cracking-on,
but that made no difference to old Jock Sutherland.</p>

<p>We were nearing St. Paul's when, in the afternoon, a big fourmaster
barque hove in sight on our port quarter, overtaking us, under six
t'gallant sails, whilst we were flying along under six topsails, but
the other ship was loaded and we were light, and in no shape, with our
stump t'gallant masts, to try to get away from her. The wind was well
aft, which made it worse for us, owing to our makeshift rig. But all
that didn't matter a bean to Jock.</p>

<p>"He'd never had a ship pass him with any of his sails furled, and he
was not going to start now."</p>

<p>"<i>Set everything!</i>"</p>

<p>We set everything, and before dark ran her right out of sight. And
small wonder, for when we hove the log at eight bells (eight o'clock)
that night, we were reeling off thirteen and a half knots. Two hands at
the wheel and then all they could do to hold her on her course and
prevent her broaching to; the mizzen royal, and the mizzen royal
staysail doing their utmost to force her up in the wind. One thing,
being in ballast, she was dry, though why on earth she didn't turn
right over, heaven and old Jock alone knew-- and he said nothing. As a
matter of fact, the Mate and he were walking up and down the poop, each
waiting for the other to make the first suggestion for shortening down,
and neither would. Both good chums; both crackers-on, and you've got
the situation!</p>

<p>At last eight bells came, and the relief of the watches. We all
heard the Mate, Mr. Williams, say, "Keep a good look-out for land ahead
and of the lee bow. Relieve the wheel, and look out. That will do the
watch," and my watch went below. The Second Mate, taking over, said to
the Mate, "Just as soon as you get below I'm for having some of these
sails in."</p>

<p>"Just as you like," the Mate replied, "and the sooner the
better."</p>

<p>It was blowing a gale, and he knew quite well the risk we were
running in that sea, which by this time was like a house side, and the
ship nearly unmanageable.</p>

<p>As I turned in I heard the Second Mate go forward along the fore and
aft bridge which links up the poop to the half deck, midship house and
fo'c'sle, so that anyone could get fore and aft without touching the
main deck. On the fo'c'sle head he found the lookout man coiling down
the flying jib downhaul, a new rope, just rove off the day before, and
which eventually saved our lives.</p>

<p>We should have seen the land before, only for a heavy squall of rain
that passed ahead, just at eight bells. The Second Mate, looking up,
with the squall clearing, suddenly saw the loom of the land right
ahead, and the ship rushing for it at racehorse speed.</p>

<p>One of our chaps had just got up to blow out the light in the half
deck, when we heard Mowatt come thumping along the bridge roaring out:
"Hard down. All hands on deck. Let go royal and t'gallant
halyards."</p>

<hr><a name="ch08"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER EIGHT</h3>

<h4>WRECKED ON ST. PAUL'S</h4>

<p>Poor old Mowatt! He'd got the shock of his life, and in his
excitement had given the wrong order; though he wasn't to know that.
His idea was to bring her up in the wind, and either reach clear of the
land, or go about and stand off on the other tack. He had not seen, up
till then, that there was four miles of land to windward, (the way he
was turning the ship," but only two to leeward.</p>

<p>Old Jock, with his experience, when he got on deck a moment later,
took all this in, and countermanded Mowatt's order with:</p>

<p>"Hard up. Square away the Cro'jack yard."</p>

<p>The wind had been two points on the port quarter, therefore Jock
also saw she would, if brought up to the wind and being in ballast,
just sag to leeward and take the rocks broadside. Then nobody would
have had a ghost of a chance. (Not that anyone would have give a brass
farthing for our chances, as it was.) Jock saw that by putting the helm
up he could clear the two miles to leeward, if--and it was a big if--he
could get her round in time.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances, or given the time, he would have done
it, but conditions were dead against him. She had started to come up,
and had been carrying the helm nearly hard up all the time, in
consequence of the terrific pressure of sail aft. So that by the time
she checked coming up, and started to pay off a bit, it seemed too
late. She had just gone off so far that she was back on her original
course, heading straight for the land, and the decision then had to be
made, was it or was it not too late, to continue the man&oelig;uvre?
Jock decided it was too late, (and certainly his decision was right)
but he had had to make the hardest possible decision the Captain of a
ship is ever called on to make. Continue to try and save his ship and
thus risk everyone's life, by the ship being driven on broadside? Or,
to put his ship straight at it, and deliberately throw her away.</p>

<p>When I got on deck, the land was towering right up above us. It was
just then that old Jock made his irrepealable decision, and I heard him
give the heart-breaking order, "Steady the Helm. Put her straight at
it. Steady as she goes. Belay everything."</p>

<p>I had only stayed in the half deck long enough to get into my shirt,
pants, and shoes. Even then, it was a sight to make me feel as though I
had missed my breakfast. Gigantic seas were tossing her high in the
air, to let her drop next moment like a stone into an almost bottomless
trough, whilst the unrelenting rocks loomed nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>Scared, yes scared stiff, but I don't think I was rattled, in fact I
don't think anyone was rattled, Jock least of all. You certainly would
not have thought so to hear him say to the Mate in a casual sort of
way, "Well she is in the breakers now. She won't be long before she
bumps."</p>

<p>Yet his heart must have been breaking. I know mine was sinking lower
and lower, as she tore at those forbidding black cliffs.</p>

<p>Only sixteen and every prospect of my bright young life coming to
the end of the chapters within the next few minutes. A queer, hardly
describable sensation of semi-suspended animation. Everyone waiting
without movement or word for the crash that must almost immediately be
followed by the short sharp struggle. Then . . . what? I don't advise
anyone to try it as an experiment. Take it from one who knows. It's
unpleasant, mighty unpleasant.</p>

<p>Jock's one last word of advice was to, "Stand aft under the break of
the poop clear of the falling gear."</p>

<p>We expected all four masts to come down like a row of ninepins. A
moment later we heard, "Every man for himself!" freeing everyone to
follow their own devices--only, there were none to follow. There was
nothing anyone could do, but just wait, wait, wait, whilst the gale
still roared and the ship laboured in the gigantic seas, racing on to
her impending doom. One could almost describe it as a relief from the
racking suspense when at last she struck. With a shuddering crash she
hit an outlying rock. The shock of that terribly alien feeling when a
ship strikes the ground went through everyone like a knife. This was
instantly followed by another terrific bump, then the sickening,
rending crash, as she tore up the rocks, ripping the bottom right out
of herself.</p>

<p>Up to that moment we had thought she was going to sail right up to
the cliff, hit it like a wall, close up like a telescope, and go down
with all hands. However, she didn't , though we discovered later, had
she been a couple of hundred yards to the northward, this is exactly
what would have happened. On the other hand, had she been the same
distance to the southward, she would have struck outlying rocks half a
mile or more out to sea. In either case it would have meant a swift and
sure exit for all of us. As it was, she struck a gradual rise, right on
the top of high water, up which she went till her bowsprit was almost
over the dry land. Then, as though to make doubly sure, a gigantic sea
came rolling up, lifted her bows up, and dropped them between two huge
pinnacles of rock, staving them both in, but holding her in a vice-like
grip and preventing any possibility of slipping back into deep
water.</p>

<p>So there she was, with every stitch of canvas set, a slight list to
port, sidelights burning, ropes coiled down, and everything in
shipshape order. The sea at the moment we struck was right aft, so all
the power it had was to smash in the stern, which it promptly did.</p>

<p>I recollect a lot of gear coming through the saloon; also an
infernal cackling from a crate of hens, that had been on the after
hatch--then blank, until I picked myself up forward. I suppose I got a
crack over the head with some piece of wreckage that came through the
gutted saloon and State rooms. I had not earned the soubriquet of
"Woodenhead" (through my ability to sleep soundly) for nothing. I felt
no ill effects anyway, so I clambered up on the foc's'le head where, by
this time, the crew had got the flying jib downhaul hitched to the end
of the bowsprit, and were sliding down on to the rocks. As almost
everybody was on the starb'd side of the boom, I nipped along to the
port side. Caught hold of the rope with one hand and let go. With the
result, that, I came a terrific cropper on the rocks below. I can only
assume it was the rubber in one's limbs at that age, and that alone,
which prevented both legs being broken.</p>

<p>As I landed on the rocks, a huge sea came over my head. I knew quite
well that it was in the backwash the danger lay, so I quickly took a
turn round one wrist, and round one leg, jamming it with the other, and
held on like grim death. When the backwash came, I could feel that rope
dragging through my hands, inch by inch. If it were possible to squeeze
the heart out of a rope, I should think I did. So great was the drag of
the water that it sucked my shoes off.</p>

<p>However, the backwash expended itself at last, and, half drowned, I
swung over the rocks again, and let go sharp, for I could feel the rope
vibrating, which indicated that somebody else was coming down to try
their luck. He also landed with a pretty good bump, and together we
scrambled up the rocks, to get out of the way of the next breaker. It
was black dark, blowing, raining, and bitterly cold, though it wasn't
until later on that we noticed the cold.</p>

<p>Our scramble brought us up against the face of a wet, perpendicular,
and particularly slimy rock. The sides we could not see; the top we
could only reach. Leonard, the chap with me, had his wits about him,
and barked,</p>

<p>"Give me your foot. Up you go, youngster."</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. I landed on the top, then turned to reach
for him.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," he called out of the darkness.</p>

<p>Evidently he had found a way round and at this moment, as I got to
my feet, along came a breaker, roaring up the rocks, and just deep
enough, to lift me off my feet and carry me bodily forward. A few
moments, then again the backwash, and I was swimming for dear life, at
odd times trying to dig my fingers into the slimy, slippery stone,
knowing that I was going backwards and backwards, towards the edge of
that big rock up which I had just climbed. Over that edge, and it would
be all up for me. I put every ounce of swimming into it that I ever
knew, and ended with my legs, from the knees downward, dangling over
the edge. But I was safe, and the next sea did <i>not</i> catch me, for
I was high and dry.</p>

<p>We lost only one man, and that was Mr. Williams, the Mate, a great
favourite with us boys, partly because he was so good natured,--
altough a strict disciplinarian--and partly because he was such a fine
wrestler. At one tme he had, I believe, wrestled for the championship
of Cornwall.</p>

<p>The flying jib downhaul down which we slid to the rocks was a new
rope, half manilla and half jute, and when that grade of rope gets wet,
it oozes oil for the first week or so. All I can think is that the Mate
came down by the run, as I did, and probably broke his legs at the
bottom. Or else he was not as lucky as the rest of us in dodging the
backwash. However, we never saw him again. It was a marvel that half of
us ever saw daylight again.</p>

<p>What a night. Bitterly cold, blinding rain and heavy sprays breaking
right over us. If we had not been made of cast-iron we certainly could
not have stuck it.</p>

<p>My cousin and I--he was third mate--did a little exploring to see if
we could find some sort of shelter from the wind and rain. In great
delight I sang out that I had found a cave, and he replied: "Well get
into it, and see what it is like."</p>

<p>So we got in, and crawled and crawled, but it did not seem to afford
much shelter, and, eventually, we crawled out the other side. It was
only a huge boulder thrown up against the cliff. Still, it helped.</p>

<p>The old ship made a most wonderful picture there, with a slight list
to port, every stitch of sail set (even our precious t'gallant sails),
and side lights still burning, looking for all the world as if she was
still running her Eastern down.</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the morning, the wind suddenly shifted to the
north-west, and with it, the sea. Up to this time the waves, coming
from right aft had only power to smash her stern in, and nothing more.
The first sea, after the sudden shift, caught her on the quarter and
broke her back; the second sea parted her amidship, and brought down
the Mizzen and Jigger masts; in fact, the whole after part sank out of
sight. It was a staggering sight to see those towering masts with their
steel yards come tumbling and crashing down--the old ship was literally
disintegrating before our eyes. The fourth sea brought the Mainmast
down, and almost immediately afterwards, the Foremast. When morning
broke, the only vestige left was the bare bows, and although weighing
hundreds of tons, they were tossed up high and dry, on the rocks, like
a battered shell--all that remained of that once proud ship, the old
<i>Holt Hill</i>.</p>

<p>No doubt St. Paul's island in prehistoric times rose out of the sea,
as the result of some titanic submarine volcanic disturbance, and there
is no disguising the fact, a volcanic horror it has remained ever
since. No waving palms, coral reefs, and silver sands on St. Paul's;
just a bleak, bare, barren, and, for the most part, inaccessible
island. Cold and raw, with the ever present threat of going up in the
air at any moment.</p>

<p>Peep of day next morning saw us scrambling up the cliffs aiming for
the top of the island. As we got up a bit, we found the cliff side
consisted of nothing better than loose rubble, cinders, and lots of
loose rocks. The result, and residue of the last volcanic effort. It
didn't help the climbing, for whenever we got hold of a rock, in all
probablility it was just stuck in the rubble, and promptly came away,
leaving one balanced, half in mid air and half hanging on to the rock.
"Stand clear below," was the caution, and then let go!</p>

<p>That rock would start another, until there was a full fledged
avalanche careering down the cliff side, making it altogether a fairly
exciting climb, but not by any means the easiest part was dodging other
people's rocks!</p>

<p>By the time we did get to the top, the sun was up. Did we not revel
and roll in the dry grass? What a treat to feel warmth once more.</p>

<hr><a name="ch09"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER NINE</h3>

<h4>A DESERT ISLAND</h4>

<p>As we were lords of all we surveyed, and at perfect liberty to go
where we wished--without the slightest fear of trespassing--three of us
set a course, as it turned out, right straight across the island.
Frequently we had to work our way round huge gaps in the ground, from
which came sulpherous fumes, in a kind of steamy smoke. Admitted there
are a few goats on the island, but they are like the proverbial
Chinaman who can live on the smell of an oil rag. Whatever they do live
on, certainly does not detract from their activity. "Now you see me,
now you don't"; a glimpse on the skyline, and gone again. Certainly
before one could have got within rifle range--if we had possessed such
a thing. No doubt these goats, also the rabbits, of which there are a
fair quantity, have been put on the island by ships, in times past. The
rabbits and goats, unfortunately, find their living on top of the
island; whilst any unfortunate human beings must always keep to the sea
level, in order to get water.</p>

<p>We continued on our way, and the going was somewhat like walking up
a fairly steep hill. Up this slope we trudged. No signs of either water
or life. No trees; not even a bush. I suppose we had been working our
way along for the best part of a couple of hours, up and still up,
looking more at our feet than to our front. Suddenly I stopped, for we
seem to have come to the edge of the world. There, lying like a
panorama, over two thousand feet below us, was a wonderful lagoon,
absolutely circular, with cliffs all around,, except just where the sea
had broken in on the far side. There, the cliffs ran down to two
shingle spits with a 16 foot channel between them, giving entrance to
the lagoon. One chap with us who had eyes like the proverbial hawk,
said he could see huts. I had good eyesight too, but perched up there I
could see nothing resembling house or hut. As a matter of fact, as it
turned out, there were five huts, and when we did get down we found the
one he could only just see, was actually large enough to hold the whole
forty-two of us, at one end!</p>

<p>As there was nothing to be gained by staying perched up there, we
started to look for a break in the face of the cliff, which was pretty
nearly perpendicular, but overgrown with long rank grass, any three or
four blades of which it was almost impossible to break. We soon found a
place where we could negotiate the overhanging lip, and with a very
creditable imitation of monkeys, we commenced to swing, toboggan and
bump our way down.</p>

<p>We found that the whole of the cliff was honeycombed with caves, and
we frequently discovered ourselves dangling bodily over one of these
openings.</p>

<p>I am convinced, and I always have been, that if a thorough search
should be made of these caves, hoards of pirates' treasure would most
certainly be unearthed, but the first step towards anything like that
would have to be the burning of all this rank grass.</p>

<p>Everywhere there are indications showing that the island has been
used for many purposes. Traces of old whalers, and sealers, and
evidences of occupations long before that. There were boats of a build
unknown to the oldest sailor amongst us, the planking and timbers,
although inches thick, crumbled away in one's hand. Old time anchors,
with their wooden stocks rotted out, in fact there was actually a built
slip, where a small vessel could be hauled up, scraped and painted. The
huts must have been in existence for over a hundred years, and there
were many other indications that immediately jump to a sailor's eye as
evidence that it had been used as a base for some seafaring
enterprise.</p>

<p>What more ideal place to catch an unwary East Indiaman, after
running his Easting down and ready to turn north? Very likely he would
be trying to sight the island to correct his position. In bad weather a
schooner could lie in the lagoon, happily, and in perfect safety. No
matter what sea running outside, the lagoon is always like a millpond.
A lookout on the top of the island would soon spot one of the lumbering
old timers in the distance. Then the schooner could be warped and towed
out, just hiding in the entrance, till the time was judged ripe to make
the attack, and that, we can imagine, would be both sharp and short.
Then back with their booty to the lair, leaving no track or trace. even
wreckage would not stand one chance in a thousand of ever being sighted
in those latitudes. The caves lent themselves as perfect hiding places
for the plunder and, in my firm opinion, there it remains to this day,
for it is notorious that pirates never lived to enjoy their ill-gotten
gains.</p>

<p>There is treasure hidden all over the world, but in my humble
opinion, St. Paul's holds the long sought secret of many a pirate's
hoard.</p>

<p>It has always been,--and still is, --my ambition to search these
caves, and sometime, with a bit of luck, I will.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of good reasons why St. Paul's has never yet
been searched. One very good reason is that there are a few thousand
bleak miles of sea to negotiate; eternal gales to contend with, a crew
to pay, and provisions to find. Furthermore, you must take water with
you, or content yourself with condensed water. Another item on the
catalogue of wants would be the wherewithal to burn off the grass that
at present very successfully and completely hides the openings to every
one of the caves.</p>

<p>Why didn't we search whilst we were there: For the simple reason
that we were far too busy keeping body and soul from parting company.
In later years I did get one expedition together, and it was only by
the slimmest chance that it fell through. We had the ship, and we had
the very necessary capital (which is of some importance). Like many
other dreams, it didn't materialise, but I still in my dreams see that
smart little schooner anchored in that lagoon, loading up with gold,
jewels, and all imaginable treasures, that forever live in the mind of
the treasure hunter.</p>

<p>Having got down to the edge of the water, we started in to work our
way round towards the huts, which by now, we could see quite clearly.
Here and there we came across boiling springs, amongst the rocks, which
showed that something down under was still alive and warm.</p>

<p>Bill, my cousin, tried the water in the springs, and said it was
fresh. I just took his word for it, as I was a bit too excited to be
particularly thirsty--though that added joy was to come, and pretty
soon.</p>

<p>Arrived at the huts, the first cry from the fellows already there
was, "Have you found water?" I said, "Yes," and was asked to show them
were it was. So off back I went, but I suppose half an hour had elapsed
between times. Anyhow, we journeyed off for the springs, climbing over
the rocks from pool to pool; but they were all salt; salt as Lot's
wife.</p>

<p>What had happened, I found out later, was, that between the time of
our coming round the lagoon, and taking these other chaps back again,
the tide had risen and flowed into the pools.</p>

<p>Others said they had found water on top of the island--a small
well.</p>

<p>By next day most of us had become pretty desperate, and it behoved
us to call up a volunteer party, to shin up those two thousand odd feet
with oilskins, sea boots, and any other receptacles that would hold
water. Fortunately the north point had a gradual ascent, and afforded
some decent foothold.</p>

<p>The water party was led by an able seaman, named Bartle Macintyre,
one of the finest sailors I have ever met, and one that nothing ever
daunted. Actually, he made the party climb that cliff, with only six
short intervals of rest. Arriving at the top, I, for one, was just
about all-in. But after one last spell, we started the tramp to find
this well. The going now was not too bad, and we made good time,
though, as far as I was concerned, things were getting hazier and
hazier, and I was rapidly losing interest. I could see the fellows
walking ahead, but they seemed a mighty way off. I was long past
speaking; in fact my tongue was just completely dried up, and my lips
were split in two or three pieces. I remembered quite well one of the
chaps coming back and relieving me of the pair of oilskin pants, which
I was carrying, tied at the bottom to fill up with water.</p>

<p>I pointed to a slight depression I had noticed, and two or three of
us went down to see if by chance, there was any water, and found the
ground fairly moist. They called the others back. We tore up the damp
ground, squeezing the mud into the palms of our hands and drinking it.
Although it was just mud, and barely wet enough to moisten our lips, it
was as nectar to our parched throats. Very soon we all took the trail
again. I knew, quite well, why they had taken these oilskins from me,
and I realised that once I stumbled and fell down (which seemed quite
likely) I should not get up again. I was conscious, clearly conscious,
and remembered every incident; how the fellows gradually faded into the
distance, finally, I saw them no more. But I still kept trudging on and
on, determined to keep up on end as long as I could. After a time I
suddenly brought up with a start, for in front of me, I saw a pool of
beautifully clear water.</p>

<p>"Ha," I thought, "now, this is a mirage. Now in what books have I
read about mirages?" and I stood there trying to recollect a book, or
the name of an author that had dealt with these mirages, for I was
fully convinced that that was what I saw. Then, as I gazed at this pool
of water, which also seemed to be getting a bit hazy, I imagined I
could see men lying down around it, and in an inconsequent way, I
considered that just another strange phenomenon. Then I further noticed
that they seemed to be actually drinking. "Well," I thought, "I have
read about a mirage, where you could see water, but never where you
could actually observe men going through all the motions of drinking."
Still I gazed, making no effort whatever to reach the water, for I was
stone wall sure that it was absolutely nothing but a mirage. Then it
seemed as if I could even recognise some of the faces. "Why that is
Bartle Macintyre," I thought. Then at last it struck me. Can it be
real? and I bent down to try and touch the water. Sure enough, it was a
real pool of pure clear crystal water. Instantly, I tried to scoop it
up in my hands and drink, but I might as well have tried to lift the
water with a sponge; my hands just absorbed it. then I remembered a
quart bottle in my pocket, which had been overlooked when they relieved
me of my precious oilskin pants. I plunged this into the water, filled
and drank it; filled again and drank it. Three times in all.</p>

<p>I suppose after drinking like that, nothing but an ostrich like
constitution saved me, though perhaps the saving grace was that we all
laid down without moving, and went fast asleep.</p>

<p>Later we woke, filled every single receptacle to its utmost capacity
and started on our way, back to the lagoon.</p>

<p>We took a slightly different course returning, which carried us
through some high coarse grass, and here we retrieved the Captain, who,
despite all our persuasion and in fact, some threats of force, had
steadfastly refused to leave the scene of the wreck. The loss of the
ship seemed to have preyed very heavily on his mind, and certainly he
was never the same man again, and never took another command, although
at the Board of Trade Enquiry he was to all intents and purposes,
exonerated from blame.</p>

<p>We happened to see his head appear at one time above the long grass,
and then he disappeared, having, as it proved, fallen down, and it was
doubtful if he would ever have got on his feet again had we not found
him. We gave him a good drink, and partly carrying him, managed to get
him away. Before our party left the huts in search of water, several
boats had already been found--in various stages of decay--and we had
launched one, in slightly better condition than the rest, with the idea
of having it meet us at the edge of the lagoon on our return with
water.</p>

<p>Knowing the conditions of the fellows when we left, we should not
have been surprised if an attempt were to be made to rush the water
containers. So the strongest formed a sort of bodyguard, wilst we
youngsters became the carriers. Much to our surprise, the fellows in
the boat took very little notice of us, and at first we thought this
was perhaps part of a rather deep game to catch us unawares, and so get
hold of the water. It should be borne in mind that before we started,
many of them were half crazy through drinking salt water.</p>

<p>About half way across the lagoon we got rather tired of sitting
tight, protecting our precious water bags, and asked them if they
didn't want a drink. To our amazement they replied, quite
indifferently, "Oh, no, we found water just after you left!"</p>

<p>So we had had our little jaunt for nothing.</p>

<p>Actually what they had discovered was the selfsame springs that we
had found on our first journey round the lagoon, only it so happened
that in their search they had come across them again, just at dead low
water, which, as it turned out, was the only time when the water could
be obtained in any other condition than salt. I say in any other
condition, for there was really very little to choose after all, either
salt or fresh. The taste was utterly vile. They were just some sort of
mineral springs from which the water had to be collected while still
boiling hot, and then allowed to cool down, but the taste was somewhat
similar to what one associates with, say, a mixture of chalk and
antiquated egg! We drank it simply because we must quench our thirst,
but even though years have passed I can still taste the beastly stuff.
However, that was our drink, and we could take it or leave it, just as
we liked.</p>

<p>The menu card included penguins, crayfish, Cape salmon and eggs. The
least said about the latter, the better. Had we only arrived a few
weeks earlier they might have been possible, but at that time, most of
them that still remained eggs were in a very advanced state of
incubation. The penguins were slightly better. Half fish and half bird,
they seemed to have acquired all the bad qualities of both. The fish,
unfortunately, took after the water, and tasted, if anything, worse.
Crayfish formed the staple diet, when we could get them, which was only
when the tide was rising, and not always then. Outside the lagoon,
there were stacks of perfectly good and eatable Cape salmon. So there
were in British Columbia! Lacking the wherewithal to catch them, they
were as useful to us, in our position, as were the others. The old
relics on the island that <i>would</i> actually float, were not equal
to sea work; and after the first couple of days there were mighty few
of us anyway with strength left to row a boat across the lagoon, let
alone outside the shingle spits, in the open sea.</p>

<p>Everything on the island seemed poisonous. Some of the fellows took
penguins' skins to wrap round their feet in lieu of boots, , but if
they had the slightest scratch they very soon had to discard the skins,
as their feet just swelled up and festered.</p>

<p>Our faith had to be pinned to crayfish, which we caught by attaching
the innards of a penguin to the end of a line; throwing it out into the
deep water, and then drawing it slowly in, the crayfish following. But
this could only be done on an incoming tide, as that was the only time
the crayfish seemed to rise. They were pretty hefty chaps and could
easily nip a finger off between the serrated edges of their tails!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER TEN</h3>

<h4>A FIGHT WITH ALBATROSSES</h4>

<p>Several expeditions were made overland across to the wreck, in the
hopes of getting something from the old ship, but all we ever secured
was about a dozen pounds of pork--this had evidently been washed out of
one of the harness casks, on deck, and drifted ashore; a bit of canvas,
and about a fathom of rope. Out of the rope we made our fishing
lines.</p>

<p>The party returning from the wreck, on the occasion when they had
retrieved the pork, had the good luck to catch three rabbits, and
eventually made their way down the broken north end of the cliff, which
we had found easiest to negotiate. The only drawback, as this returning
party soon found to their cost, was the fact that it led down close
past an albatross rookery.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that to a man fallen overboard an albatross
is almost as bad as a shark. The latter attacks the man from below the
water, but an albatross can, and will, drive his beak clean through a
man's skull whilst swooping past in the air, which very likely accounts
for the Ancient Mariner grabbing one by the neck and hanging on--I
don't blame him.</p>

<p>When the albatrosses scented the pork and the rabbits, they rose in
a cloud to share a cheap meal. The party of humans had no alternative
but to back up against the cliff, put the pork and the rabbits to the
rear, and do their best to beat off the birds. Someone who was working
on the beach down below heard their SOS, and raised the alarm. Arming
ourselves with sticks, staves, or anything we could lay hands on, we
dashed up the cliff (as well as we could do any dashing by this time)
to the rescue of the party who were making a valiant fight to retain
their precious pork and rabbits. Arriving there, we handed out sticks.
Those that had knives used a stick in one hand and a knife in the
other; and for the next half an hour it was just a battle royal with
these huge birds, measuring anything from fifteen to twenty feet from
tip to tip of their wings. Finding that their grabs at the grub were
ineffectual, they varied operations by swooping down, and making a dive
at one's face or eyes as they planed past. We, of course, retaliated,
first with a stick, giving them a crack over the head, and then, as
they fell, driving a knife in between their shoulders, which we found
the best way of settling them, otherwise, they simply rose and went for
us again.</p>

<p>Beyond some pretty severe gashes, we came out of it quite well,
still hanging on to our pork and rabbits.</p>

<p>What a meal that was! All boiled down in a huge cauldron, mixed in
with a few fish, some grass, and thistles. It formed about the one and
only decent meal during our occupation of the island.</p>

<p>There are very few albatross rookeries to be found in the world.
These birds do come ashore to breed, but otherwise they seem to live on
the wing, and if they do sleep, they also certainly sleep on the wing,
for you meet with them thousands of miles from land, in gales of wind,
when they couldn't possibly sleep on the water. They have absolutely no
fear, and will hover with the tip of their wing almost touching the
bridge of even a steamer, and stare the officer of the watch straight
in the face with their little, black, beady eyes. They fall an easy
prey to a little bit of pork, and one of the easiest methods of
catching them from a ship is to get a piece of tin cut into a triangle
with the sides half an inch wide, tie some strips of pork onto the tin,
and let it drop astern on the end of a line. At the point of an
albatross' beak is a hook, almost exactly resembling a lion's claw.
When they make a dab to catch the pork, the point of their beak goes
into the centre of the triangle, and is drawn to the apex where it
jams, and, providing he will rise in the air, proves an easy capture.
Unless the line is slacked off he can never get his beak out. On the
other hand, if he determines to resist, and puts his feet and the wings
in the water, it is good-bye to line, bait and all.</p>

<p>I have seen one caught measuring thirty feet from tip to tip of its
wings.</p>

<p>The rookery on St. Paul's consisted of a number of ledges where it
seemed as though the fathers and mothers of all albatrosses came to
spend their last days. Some two or three hundred feet felow at the base
of the cliff was a mound of bones covering nearly half an acre of
ground, fully a hundred feet high, and must have weighed scores of
tons. It was nothing but the bones of ancient albatrosses, that, from
time immemorial had gone there to die, eventually tumbling off the
ledges from old age, to add to the bones below. Some of the beaks were
picked up were over a foot in length, and the birds they had been
attached to must certainly have had well over a thirty foot spread.</p>

<p>On nearly all these outlying islands there is a cache of provisions,
supposed to be maintained by the Government of the country to whom the
island belongs, but in point of fact, this job is usually carried out
by British ships. We searched everywhere as long as our strength held
out for this cache, which we knew must be there, but never found it.
Some twelve years later, when I was on my first voyage out to Australia
in the White Star Line, I happened to be reading a book of sailing
directions, which described the situation of these various caches, and
the one on St. Paul's was referred to as being "marked by a cairn of
stones on the South spit." I knew it at once. The cairn of stones had
been there all the time, but painted on the side was "Mrs. Smith and
child, wife of Captain Smith, died such-and-such a date."</p>

<p>Naturally, we thought it marked her grave, and that being so we
would not touch it. Yet tobacco, potatoes, tinned provisions of all
kinds, were there beside us all the time and to be had for the
taking--and last, but not least, matches also. Amongst the forty-two of
us there had been only one dry match, and with that we made a fire,
which we had to keep going night and day, the whole time we were on the
island.</p>

<p>We seem to have been slightly worse off than other ships that at odd
times had left their bones there; that is, in the way of getting
provisions.</p>

<p>In the entrance to the lagoon the wreck of H.M.S.
<i>Meg&aelig;ra</i> is still visible, although she was run ashore there
as long since as 1874. Bound from Simon's Bay, West Africa, with a
crew, and relief crews, numbering 375, she sprung a leak the first week
out. She was only 1400 tons, and heavily rigged for sailing, although
she had 350 h.p. engines down below. She sprung a leak under the
bunkers, in the sheathing, where a rivet came out, and when the
engineers attacked it, with a view to securing a supporting plate, they
found that the ship's bottom in places was the thickness of a sixpenny
piece, and to attempt to do anything would undoubtedly have been fatal.
They were already running before the usual heavy westerly gale, and
mountainous seas, and it seemed hopeless to turn about and try the
Vanderdecken touch and beat back to the Cape.</p>

<p>There is no sea in the world equal to that which one meets down in
those south latitudes, it comes literally swinging round the world,
with no land to break or intercept it.</p>

<p>One moment you are riding right up on the back, getting the full
force of the gale, and the next you are down in the trough, which only
the upper yards on the mast visible to anyone around. Even a twelve
thousand ton ship, on the side of one of these seas is like nothing
better than a fly on the wall. The saving grace is that they are so big
that they seldom break! Woe betide the ship that is running before it,
and one of these seas does break! I saw it once, and it was nothing
short of a miracle that anyone lived to tell the tale.</p>

<p>The choice the Captain of the <i>Meg&aelig;ra</i> had put before him
was a might bitter one. A short beat back to the Cape, or a three
thousand mile run to the nearest land, and that land was only the
islands of St. Paul's and Amsterdam. He took the wiser course; in fact,
the only course, and ran with every stitch of canvas towards St.
Paul's. The pumps were continually getting choked with weed and to make
matters worse, the straining of the ship caused other rivets to loosen
up.</p>

<p>Ultimately, every man jack on board, including officers, was bailing
with anything, and everything, to keep her afloat. Stoke-hold fires had
been put out very early on, sails were passed under her bottom, and
held in place with lashings of rope, but proved to be of very little
use. She was making a good eleven knots under sails alone, and of
course these patchwork quilts were simply washed away. After many days
of intense anxiety, they at last sighted St. Paul's, and finally came
to anchor at the mouth of the lagoon.</p>

<p>They got the ship pumped out, and then fires going, divers down, and
the holes plugged.</p>

<p>They then went to work and tried to put a supporting plate on the
outside, when, with hardly a moment's warning, the whole original plate
gave way.</p>

<p>They had just time to slip their anchors, and run her as hard as
they could for the beach. She grounded between the shingle spits in
sixteen feet of water, and in the process ripped nearly the whole of
the bottom out of her; and there her bones still lie to this day.</p>

<p>Fortunately, whilst still afloat, all provisions, sails and stores
had been landed, and they had actually on the island food for all hands
for one month. But as there was every likelihood of their spending
several months there, they had to go on short rations forthwith; just
enough to keep them alive; and well it was they took this drastic
action, for it was four months before they were eventually taken
off.</p>

<p>They were more fortunate than we were in the fact that they
possessed their own boats, thoroughly seaworthy, and could work outside
the harbour where ample fish could be caught. In fact, as an officer of
that ill-fated ship told me, he caught no less than 1,100 pounds of
fine Cape salmon within a few hours, with only his boat's crew, and
this only just outside the shingle spits.</p>

<p>Several ships came in sight but never near enough to make out their
distress signals. Eventually, with one of their lifeboats, an officer
was able to board a passing ship, bound for Surabaya, but before
anything could be done in the way of rescue, the usual gale sprang up,
and she was driven away.</p>

<p>However, they made port with this officer and his boat's crew on
board, who got in touch with the naval authorities at Hong Kong, and
the P &amp; O s.s. <i>Malacca</i> was despatched at once to take them
off. Beyond casualties through scalding when the boilers burst at the
time she was run ashore, there were no losses.</p>

<p>Some of the tales that are left written on St. Paul's have not that
happy ending; and with the crew of more than one ship, it has been the
last survivor who has finally scratched his message on a piece of wood
or stone to be read by those who came after. Just a silent record of a
few of the risks that have to be taken by those who "go down to the sea
in ships."</p>

<p>It is bad enough to be stuck on an island with little hope of
rescue, but it is worse when, after many days, a ship heaves in sight
and deliberately leaves the castaways. In all the time we had been
there not one single ship had been sighted, till the early morning of
the day we were taken off. That morning, the first man out of the hut
rubbed his eyes to make sure he was really awake, for there, lying
becalmed, close in to the island, lay a full rigged ship under all
sail. The next second everyone was awake and dashing out of the hut in
response to his roar of "Sail-ho!"</p>

<p>We had only one boat that made any pretence at floating, and this,
with her crew, was detailed for fishing. The tide served that morning
at daybreak, as the best time for catching crayfish, with the result
that the boat was right over the other side of the lagoon, and the ship
was hidden from the boat by the south cliff. We yelled, and hailed, and
only after a long, heartbreaking delay, got the boat from under the
cliffs.</p>

<p>As soon as they were in a position to see the ship, they pulled as
hard as their strength would let them, out of the harbour, and were
actually half way between the island and the ship, when a slight breeze
sprang up. It is hard to believe, but down went that ship's helm, she
went about, and deliberately stood off from the land.</p>

<p>On shore we had a huge fire burning, sending up columns of smoke,
and everyone of us that could stand was waving his shirt. We could even
see the men on her deck.</p>

<p>It was a rank impossibility for those on board not to have seen the
column of smoke, or our boat, and yet, away she went, and that is the
tragedy that so frequently happens in these cases.</p>

<p>One of the most glaring instances was that in which the
<i>Volturno</i> on fire in mid-Atlantic, in fine weather, was passed by
a big steamship, without her taking the slightest notice. It was fine,
clear weather, and the dense column of smoke rising from the burning
oil could have been seen twenty-five or thirty miles away, and yet, a
ship not five miles off, passes and takes no notice. Again in the case
of the <i>Titanic</i>, which I am going to tell about later, we were
using every modern method, visible and invisible to call the attention
of a ship actually in sight, yet, there she lay, making no attempt at
rescue, whilst some fifteeen hundred people patiently waited and were
finally drowned with that ship's lights still in sight.</p>

<p>In our case on the island of St. Paul's the boat had no alternative
but to return. We did not even get the name of the ship, as there was
no name on her stern. If there had been, the Second Mate could easily
have read it; and yet, where will you find a ship without her name and
port of registry on her stern? Some have said, "Oh, it must have been a
phantom ship, the outcome of some delirious imagination. You were
starving, you know." They might just as well have put it down to the
"morning after the night before,"--only unfortunately, we lacked the
wherewithal.</p>

<p>She was not seen by one, or a half a dozen, but by all of us, and
you can't mesmerize forty-two men. Anyhow it just about knocked the
bottom out of what spirits we had left, and they were mighty few. We
had been there eight days, and it would take less than another eight to
finish the lot.</p>

<p>Anyhow, we weren't going to be caught napping another time, so we
instituted a day and night look-out, on a hill top above the camp,
where a good view could be obtained all round, northward and westward.
The same hill where many other ships' crews have kept their sometimes
fruitless vigil, others to watch for their welcome rescuer, and where
the <i>Meg&aelig;ra</i> managed to mount a twelve-pounder gun.</p>

<p>The boat we had for general purposes, including fishing, was now
detailed to stand by, to intercept any other ship that might come
along, and the crew, although allowed to fish, were forbidden to be out
of hail. We launched another boat for a fishing party; she floated, and
that is about all that could be said for her. She was nearly as broad
as she was long; in fact, it would be interesting to know what kind of
ship ever brought her to the island. Then we settled down for another
wait, although, as it turned out, not for long.</p>

<hr><a name="ch11"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h3>

<h4>A TIMELY RESCUE</h4>

<p>Later on, that same afternoon, to our joy and amazement, we again
heard that welcome cry of "Sail-o!" from the lookout. At once, the fire
on the look-out hill was lit, a piece of canvas hoisted up on the flag
staff, which we had also rigged, and the boat was instantly manned and
shoved off out of the harbour. It was not long before all those who
could were up on the look-out hill; and sure enough, there was a little
barque which had just rounded the point, sailing along the western side
of the island, with just a light breeze, all sails set. She did look a
picture; in fact, speaking for myself, there has never been a more
welcome picture in my life.</p>

<p>Our vital consideration now was as to whether or not she would see
us or our signal; or if our boat would float long enough to be able to
intercept her. We waited and waited, as she slowly drew along the land,
then at last we knew that she had actually seen us. Down came her
t'gallant sails and staysails; up went her mainsail and foresail, and
she definitely hauled in towards land. Joy! oh, joy, never was there a
more welcome sight. And furthermore, she had also seen our boat, which
we watched go alongside, and the Second Mate jump on board.</p>

<p>These then were the questions from Captain Hayward:</p>

<p>"What ship?"</p>

<p>"<i>Holt Hill</i>, sir."</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"Wreck, and total loss."</p>

<p>"How many more of you on the Island?"</p>

<p>"Only thirty-seven, sir."</p>

<p>"My God! I can't take all of you. I'm already short of provisions
for my own crew of six."</p>

<p>Then after a few moments anxious thought:</p>

<p>"I will take half of you."</p>

<p>Mowatt replied, "Well, sir, I'm afraid it will mean certain death
for those left behind."</p>

<p>"Is it as bad as all that," asked Captain Hayward. Then flinging
caution to the wind, "well, all right, tell them <i>all</i> to come
along then. We'll manage somehow."</p>

<p>Mowatt was just a bit wise in his generation, and said, "My men all
played out, sir. Do you think you could send four of your men in the
boat?"</p>

<p>Our boat's crew <i>was</i> played out, even with that short pull,
but Mowatt figured that with our of our chaps on board, weak though
they were, there would be no likelihood of what had happened that same
morning, and it would be all the more certain if he could persuade the
Captain to let some of his own men go away with orders for the rest to
come aboard. He asked Captain Hayward to stand in as close as he could
to the mouth of the lagoon, so that the <i>Coorong,</i> would not need
to put a boat out<i>,</i> and we could come off in the contraption we
had floating inside the harbour.</p>

<p>Our boat came ashore manned by the <i>Coorong's</i> crew, and told
us to get aboard our own boat and come off. The thirty seven of us
tumbled into the that old galliot, and with makeshift paddles and oars
and got her through the entrance. Fortunately, it was one of those rare
days when there was practically no sea, and very little wind. The
moment we got into her, the seams started to open, and water commenced
to pour in. We baled desperately, with everything we had, and it was
the toss of a button whether we would fetch the <i>Coorong</i> by boat
or by swimming. We were even tearing our shirts, and stuffing the rags
into the seams, in the endeavour to make her float a few minutes more.
We got alongside, and the last man was hardly out of her, before she
filled and sank like a stone. But we were on board with the welcome
feel of a ship under our feet once again.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," said Captain Hayward, "I'm glad to have you on board,
and I've put out on the hatch there all the biscuits and butter I've
got. Help yourselves, you might as well have one square meal. I really
ought not to take you all, but it seems that if I leave you, you may
all be dead before the next ship comes along. I'm just trusting to
sighting a ship, and getting provisions. I'm part loaded with sugar,
from Mauritius to Adelaide, and you can help yourselves to that, for
what it's worth."</p>

<p>How she came to stand out of her course from Mauritius to Adelaide
was food for quite a bit of thought.</p>

<p>She had a fair wind, and being short of provisions Captain Hayward
was particularly anxious to make the best of a fair wind; yet, for some
unknown reason, as he relates himself, "I couldn't get St. Paul's out
of my mind, and when I went below that afternoon (the one previous to
picking us up) I could not sleep. The question as to whether there was
anybody on St. Paul's would not leave my mind, partly due, perhaps, to
the fact, that I <i>had</i> once taken a crew off there. Finally, in
desperation, I came on deck, and gave orders to alter the course for
St. Paul's, and I went below, and had my nap, without any further
trouble. Up on deck, later on, he thought 'what a pity to be losing
this fine fair wind,' for by standing away south to St. Paul's, it
meant a precious loss of time. Well I changed my mind, and put her back
on her course again for Cape Leeuwin,"</p>

<p>"That night, when I went below, it was just a repetition of the
afternoon's efforts to sleep, and to make a long story short, I simply
had to get up on deck and alter the course, back again for St.
Paul's."</p>

<p>"Of course, this chopping and changing had got the whole crew on
their toes, and when finally we did sight the island, nearly everyone
was on the look-out."</p>

<p>"It was from a man working on the foretopsail yard," continued
Captain Hayward, "that we got the first inkling, when he hailed the
deck, saying that he could see a signal flyiing. In a few minutes we
saw your fire, and finally the boat, and well, here you are, and I'm
very glad to have you."</p>

<p>It was well that Caaptain Hayward put us on drastic rations from the
very first, for we never sighted a ship from there to Adelaide,
twenty-two days. Half a pound of bread, half a pound of meat, and as
much pure unadulterated raw sugar as we cared to eat.</p>

<p>Before that, if anybody had asked me at the age of sixteen, if I
could live on sugar, I should undoubtedly have said, "Give me the
chance," but as we soon found out, it can't be done.</p>

<p>We arrived in Adelaide a regular pack of scarecrows; thoroughbred
ringbolt chasers, which means in ship's parlance, that we were capable
of reeving ourselves through any fair sized ringbolt in the deck.</p>

<p>From the Semaphore our fame had spread before us, and when the
<i>Coorong</i> docked, the wharfside was packed solid with crowds of
those hospitable Australians who, during our stay, did their level best
to burst us with good cheer. So the skin and bones brigade mustered on
the wharf and gave three hearty cheers for Captain Hayward. Three more
for his crew. Then from him, "Three cheers for the crew she's
fetched."</p>

<p>There we said good-bye to our jolly old rescuer, each going his
various ways; soon to have the world between us; yet, how small a
world.</p>

<p>Ten years later I anchored off Adelaide, fourth Officer of the White
Star liner <i>Medic</i> then inaugurating the new White Star Australian
service. Off watch, and strolling round the decks I happened to meet
the pilot who had brought us up to our anchorage. With the usual ship's
camaraderie we got yarning about the ship, and Australia. The Pilot's
friend asked, " Have you ever been to Australia before?" "Yes," I said,
"and Adelaide at that, but many years ago."</p>

<p>"On what ship," he asked.</p>

<p>'Well, I wasn't exactly on a ship bound here, I was brought here
after being wrecked on St. Paul's Island in the South Indian
Ocean."</p>

<p>"Was that ship by any chance the <i>Holt Hill?</i>" he sked, rather
eagerly, and followed this question up by asking if I remembered the
name of the ship that rescued us, and brought us to Adelaide. I
replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, perfectly. The ship was the <i>Coorong</i>, belonging to
Adelaide, and her Captain was Captain Hayward."</p>

<p>He quickly stepped forward, held out his hand and said:</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you again, I'm Captain Hayward."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER TWELVE</h3>

<h4>HOME IN A TEA CLIPPER</h4>

<p>I sampled Australian life for three good and hospitable months.
Sometimes up in the Bush on a station, at other times in the town
sharing a happy-go-lucky life with those impulsive lovable, carefree
people. Picnics that could be planned with safety weeks ahead. Glorious
sunshine and three good meals a day--what more could a healthy lad of
sixteen want? Welcome everywhere as a survivor of a wreck that echoed
round the world, and which was common knowledge with every man, woman
and child of that island nation.</p>

<p>All good things must end, and the time at last came when I must tear
myself away from the everlasting attractions "Down under," if I was to
keep to the sea as a career, and I had no intentions of parting company
with her, as yet. Despite all the hours of buffeting, I never hesitated
in my allegiance to that hard-boiled mistress; harsh and bitter as she
can be at times, at others, full of captivating smiles and surprises. A
hundred years at sea couldn't wholly unfold all she has to show you.
Things that would make a landsman's eyes pop out of his head. But you
must laugh in her face, when she hits you hardest, and, above all,
never fear her; she will let you out, and make up for it in the
end.</p>

<p>Our crew had all shipped off home, except another boy and myself.
This was before the days of D.B.S. (Distressed British Seamen), when
all you have to do is to walk into the nearest British Consul's Office,
and be forwarded on to your port of hail.</p>

<p>Another curious law of the sea that still exists is, that a man's
pay stops from the time his ship is wrecked. In these days of steam and
quick passages, it does not cut so hard, but in the case of the <i>Holt
Hill</i> it caught out some of the crew pretty badly, particularly the
Mates, who must work their way back to England, before they could hope
to pick up their proper rank, and pay again, and you could safely
reckon on say 125 days to the Lizard. Even when you got home there was
still the ship to find.</p>

<p>However, these problems didn't worry Archer and myself, and I don't
suppose we should have broken away when we did, had it not been for the
Agents, impressing on us the necessity. They told us, when we used to
go round on a Saturday, for our pocket money that the Company was
worrying them to send us home. Eventually they said they would have to
stop our allowance if we didn't get move on, and get a ship. They had
been awfully decent to us; so had everyone for that matter, so much so
that when we did finally get a ship, we very nearly deserted--which
would have completely torn our Indentures, and put a finish to our
budding career</p>

<p>We had shipped on Board the <i>Duke of Abercorn</i>, one of the old
time tea clippers; towed down from Adelaide and anchored off the
Semaphore, waiting for a breeze. That night, Archer and I had the 8 to
12 watch. It was a real Australian summer night, soft as silk, and full
of magic. I can't just describe it, but it gets you in a weak spot. It
did with us, sitting there on the rail looking at the shore lights
twinkling and beckoning. Thinking of all the jolly fine times we had
had there these three months past; reflecting on one or two very nice
folk (we'll call them folk anyway) who would be tickled to death to see
us back ashore again. I suppose it was through talking there that the
urge at last got too strong, and we suddenly determined to chuck our
hands in, and get ashore again; a perfectly crazy idea, but what of
it.</p>

<p>We couldn't lower a boat; too much noise, and anyway it would be
sure to be seen.</p>

<p>There was a long wooden ladder and a big wooden refuse shoot; they
would float. So forthwith we proceeded to launch our rickety craft. The
fact that it was a good three miles to the beach, and rotten with
sharks, didn't enter into our calculations. We had got the ladder
overboard, when fate, and our good fortune intervened, in the shape of
a light breeze.</p>

<p>Quickly orders were being bellowed along the decks. "All hands on
deck. Man the windlass. Heave short. Loose all sail." Then, to the
clank, clank, of the pawls of the windlass rose the words of that good
old shanty "Rolling Home." It's a wonder if we didn't make some of them
turn over in their sleep, particularly when it came to the line, "To
Australia's charming daughters, we must bid a long good-bye." However,
it was soon over, and within an hour, the old timer was heeling over to
a steady breeze on her first clip for the Cape.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Less than a month, with an extraordinary good slant of easterly
winds, saw us within a couple of days of the Cape. Then the wind banged
round out of the westward, and became a dead muzzler.</p>

<p>For fourteen solid days we tried to beat up those few miles tack
tack and tack. Like Vanderdecken of old, it seemed as though we should
never make Table Bay, till at last, in desperation, we reached away
south, and picked up a slant which carried us round.</p>

<p>It was almost in sight of the Cape that I got my first view of a
huge Sea Bat.</p>

<p>For the last couple of days we had been shortened down, and I was up
loosing the fore royal, when I spotted my fish, lying apparently
asleep, on the surface of the water. Even at that height, he looked
monstrous. I could easily gauge his span by comparing him with the fore
yard, which was immediately under me, and measured exactly 90 feet from
yardarm to yardarm. I could see he was a fraction less, 10 feet
perhaps. We were almost on top of him, before he sounded; in fact, it
looked as though we were going to hit him. Then with just a couple of
flaps of those gigantic wings, and he was down and out of sight. Since
then, I have seen two others, but smaller.</p>

<p>The <i>Duke</i> was a real old timer. Built long before the days of
steel and iron, she had raced with such redoubtable ships as the <i>Red
Jacket, Thermopylae</i> and <i>Cutty Sark.</i> In those days she
carried more of a crew than the crack Atlantic liner has on deck
to-day. Nineteen knots, day after day, she had to her credit, in her
old logs, but these hair-raising races from China, are no more.</p>

<p>We rounded the Cape, stretched up through the Tropics and Trades,
through the Roaring Forties, and finally reached Falmouth for orders,
and a few days later made fast in the East India dock, after being
away, just on eighteen months.</p>

<p>I had to go through the hoop with Messrs. William Price and Co., the
owners of the old <i>Holt Hill</i>, in Liverpool for staying so long in
Adelaide. Other delinquencies, mainly to do with practical jokes in
foreign ports, were also on the list of the "Please explains."
Unfortunately, other nations don't appreciate the Britisher's love of a
skylark, particularly when played by a set of boys, whose reputation
was rather too well-known.</p>

<p>It was to find the ringleader, that Archer and I were called up and
hauled over the coals.</p>

<p>I always think it was a good thing, that the half deck crowd of the
<i>Holt Hill</i> was broken up, and scattered amongst other ships of
the Line; I think, as a combination--not forgetting Old Jock who loved
a lark as well as any of us--we were just a bit too hot for our own
welfare.</p>

<hr><a name="ch13"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h3>

<h4>SEA FIGHTS AND CYCLONES</h4>

<p>I soon got my marching orders, and joined up again, with a happy
half deck crowd in the old <i>Primrose Hill</i>, we were particularly
cheery, and, for the very good reason, we were bound for the Cape, and
not for that monotonous nitrate coast where 50 per cent of sailing
ships were now making their way. Steamers were quickly nobbling all the
decent trades and ports. Cape Town was one of the few left, and that
only till the docks and breakwater were finished.</p>

<p>We got away from England in September, which meant we should dodge
the winter in the north and pick up the spring and summer again down
south.</p>

<p>It always seems as though a ship on leaving port would never get
clear of the accumulated muck and dirt, and we were no exception.
Scrubbing decks, washing paintwork, and reeving new running gear till
again she was all spick and span.</p>

<p>I was now in my fourth year and was expected to be able to get
through any job that came my way, with all the despatch, accuracy, and
neatness of a fully--fledged A.B. No longer one of the "skysail
yarders." Anything up there was for first and second voyagers; nothing
above a Royal for me now. As a matter of fact I was working just below
the Royal yard one day, when I saw staged, a fight to a finish between
a full grown bull whale, a sword fish, and a thrasher. In point of
fact, the latter two do the attacking, and the whale does the running,
or tries to, but it's not once in ten times that the poor devil
escapes. Sometimes he does by sounding, and going down so deep that the
sword fish cannot follow. But if the sword fish once gets in a position
under the whale's tail, there's very little chance for that
man&oelig;uvre, as every time he attempts to sound, the sword fish
drives home that vicious 4ft. bone snout, and sends the whale scuttling
to the surface.</p>

<p>The thrasher (grampus of old) can only attack from above. He has two
enormous fins, anything up to five feet long. One projecting from his
back, and one from underneath, a short chopped off body and no tail.
When the sword fish attacks and drives the whale to the surface, the
thrasher then leaps out of the water, and lands on the whale's back,
driving deep, one of those knife-like fins.</p>

<p>We had a ring side seat, and watched the fight from start to finish.
It's not enough to say it was thrilling, which does not convey much; it
was more than that, it was terrific, and almost unheard of. Even the
watch on deck knocked off to (see) the sight.It did not last long, but
it was terrible while it did last, to see that fifty ton whale
thrashing the water into foam, in a vain endeavour to land one or the
other attacker with its flail like flukes. At other times flinging its
whole huge bulk right up in the air, and coming down on the water with
a report like a 12 inch gun. Again, tearing round in circles, leaving a
trail of blood and foam.</p>

<p>Then as suddenly as it started, it was over, and the old bull whale
was dead, and then, from every quarter, came the scavengers of the sea,
sharks, barracuta (sic) and so forth.</p>

<p>We were lying becalmed on a sea like glass, and nothing would have
given some of us greater pleasure than to shove off and go to the
assistance of the bull; but there is a trite saying from across the
pond, "Don't monkey with a buzz saw."</p>

<p>The trip down the Cape was the same routing as with most any ship
bound south. Across the one and only Bay, down past the western Isles,
through the Roaring Forties and into the Trades. Then the
pulley-hauling of the yards, working her through the Doldrums and
across the Line. More Doldrums, plenty of fish, and torrents of rain
till we picked up the S.E. Trades, and started to stretch away for the
Cape in earnest.</p>

<p>Eventually we lifted the renowned Table Mountain above the horizon
and finally came to anchor in Table Bay.</p>

<p>At this time the notorious breakwater was still under construction,
and, although representing a cool million, cost the Colony little or
nothing, as it was almost wholly built of convict labour.</p>

<p>It was a cheery gang that laboured there. "So many months," or "so
many years on the breakwater," was a common saying, and quickly applied
to anyone who was apt to sail a bit too close to the wind. Many proved
I.D.B.'s--and many that were <i>not</i> proved--subscribed their little
quota to that breakwater; in fact, culprits of petty crimes, which in
the ordinary way would have been met with a small fine, were joyfully
consigned to carry out Cape Town's ambitious scheme, of protecting the
bay with that huge rampart of granite and stone. There is no doubt it
was needed, for many and many a ship's bones lie rotting on the beach
in Table Bay through lack of protection from the dreaded
nor'wester.</p>

<p>First comes the "table cloth" on the mountain. Then the notorious
south-easter, which literally brings fine stones and gravel skeltering
down from the heights above. That is all right for the ships in the
harbour; they are sheltered, but the fun commences when the wind swings
round and comes screeching out of the nor'-west. Then the sea and the
wind drive right straight into the harbour, and in those days it was a
common sight to see a dozen or more sailing ships riding stretched out
to their anchors.</p>

<p>On the occasion of which I am speaking in the <i>Primrose Hill</i>,
when we rode out a black nor'wester, we paid out 120 fathoms on each
anchor, and that is the limit of the cable carried. On to each cable we
bent the end of a thirteen inch coir hawser (thirteen inches in
diameter); this was laid along the decks and made fast to the mooring
bits.</p>

<p>These preparations were, necessarily, carried out before the wind
shifted round. Once the sea came into the harbour it was impossible to
get forward along the decks.</p>

<p>Ships then are to be seen diving into hugh seas, in far worse
condition than when out at sea under shortened canvas. Shipping them
green over the bows, and everybody hoping against hope that the ground
tackle will hold. It sometimes happens that one anchor, or even the
coir spring on some ship will carry away. Then the trouble starts. That
particular cable parts, the second anchor will not hold her, she then
drifts down and fouls another ship. One or other either sink where they
lie, or both part their cables and drive on shore. Once they hit the
beach there is not a chance in a thousand of a single soul being saved.
Shore lifeboats are called away, but with that gigantic sea running,
accompanied by a terrific gale, there is barely time to get the shore
lifeboat afloat before one, two and sometimes even three ships will go
crashing up on the beach in a jumbled mass, to be pounded to matchwood
in a very few minutes.</p>

<p>Perhaps if the warning is sufficient, a ship will prefer to get up
her anchors, and get under way, and out of the harbour before the
dreaded shift to the N.W.comes about. Every sailor prefers deep water
and plenty of sea room to monkeying around in conditions like those
that used to prevail in Table Bay.</p>

<p>Now, of course, the breakwater is completed, and one can lie in
comfort behind it, and watch the seas doing their worst. They still
come right over, but their force is broken.</p>

<p>Leaving Cape Town behind, we ran our Easting down before the usual
old greybeards. Not an uncommon procedure running before an
exceptionally heavy sea, is to erect a canvas screen so that the
helmsman simply can't look astern at the sea which every moment
threatens to come over the poop.</p>

<p>It often happens that the gale increases from hour to hour very
slowly, very steadily, and the temptation to continue running, whilst
making an excellent passage has often proved too great, and the undoing
of more than one good skipper. The hope is always there that the gale
has reached its maximum. The glass has, perhaps, steadied a little,
temporarily; may even show a tendency to rise. The seas grow and grow,
until the term "mountainous" becomes a literal and actual fact. Then
the psychological time comes, when the choice must be made. Heave to,
or run it out; either bring her up to the wind under shortened canvas,
making no progress whatever towards your destination, but riding in
safety, or continue to run with ever-increasing risk.</p>

<p>In the latter event, the opportunity for carrying out the manoeuvre
of heaving to, with any degree of safety passes; in fact, from safety
it quickly becomes a risk, then a heavy risk, and finally an
impossibility.</p>

<p>No choice then remains. Run you must, and hope for the best; but if
one of those mountainous seas of water should bank up astern and break,
then every man must seize some immovable object and hang on to it like
grim death, hoping against hope that she will lift to it and ride. If,
on the other hand, it breaks over her, and she is what is termed
"pooped," the chances are just about a hundred to one that this is the
finish. Apart from sweeping everything before it, smashing up
everything that it doesn't wash overboard, she is filled up, rail and
rail, and before she can shake the water off, the next sea is on her.
Fortunately, one is not held in suspense. About ten minutes has seen
the finish of many a good ship, and the "gone to glory" of every man
jack of her crew.</p>

<p><i>We</i> got through all right, and after sighting St. Paul's, this
time in safety, turned north for the sea of fragrant smells. Up through
the Indian Ocean and past the Andaman Islands, where the scent of spice
spreads over the sea like a glorified chemist's shop. It's round here
one can realise the origin of the tale of the sea serpent, but in point
of fact, they are conger eels, and abound in this sea, but can be seen
when lying becalmed in a sailing ship. They may not encircle the earth,
but they are quite big enough to encircle a good sized sailing ship-
not that there is any danger of their ever doing that; in fact, such
are the conditions of the menu on board ship, that they would be
welcomed.</p>

<p>It was in the Indian Ocean that we got mixed up with my one and only
cyclone. A hair raiser of the first order. There is, as a rule, plenty
of warning when a cyclone is cruising about, and no excuse for anyone
to be caught out. For instance, long before there are visible
indications from the weather, the barometer will give ample notice, as
it did in this case.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hourse later, it commenced to bank up to the south east,
a big rolling sea got more and more confused, for no apparent reason.
Little or no wind, but huge masses of clouds. As the underpart turned a
bilious green and later on, as the edges were torn away, we saw flecks
of lightning, vicious, and threatening.</p>

<p>Long before this, the ship had been snugged down to the shortest
possible canvas; in our case three lower topsails. It is not only the
canvas that is on her, but that which is actually furled, which has to
be taken care of; for the wind when it comes, will rip a sail out of
the gaskets, just as easily as it will blow away a paper bag. All hands
must get aloft, literally marling the sails down to the yards; not a
corner the size of a pocket handkerchief must be left for the wind to
get hold of. Once a full cyclone has struck, no man can even hold on to
the rigging, much less secure any sails that are started out of their
gaskets.</p>

<p>We were lucky. We lost a couple of staysails, and a couple of flying
kites ripped out of their gaskets, and one lower topsail blown clean
out of the bolt ropes. This went with a report like a six-inch gun.</p>

<p>This would not have happened, only through some miscalculation we
let the centre pass over us.</p>

<p>A cyclone, as is well known, is a revolving circular storm with the
centre a flat calm. It was proverbial in the old days, and before the
tonnage of ships reached four figures--that no ship could pass through
the centre of a cyclone and live. The seas simply pounded over from all
sides, filling her up rail and rail, so that she was literally swamped.
With the high bulwarks and big washports, we proved that it is possible
to pass through; and in the circumstances with not a great amount of
damage. Apart from what happened to the ship, there were three broken
ribs and a broken arm, to add to our total casualties. This happened
whilst the centre was passing over. At all costs we had to get the
yards round on the other tack to meet the change of wind, and in order
to save ourselves and the ship, this had to be done during the time we
were actually in the terrific maelstrom in the centre, with the seas
leaping straight up in the air and thundering on board from all
sides.</p>

<p>However, we managed it, and the yards were hauled round before the
wind struck us again, instantly and with full force, in diametrically
the opposite direction from which it had been before. It was at that
moment that the mizzen topsail, with a cannon-like report, went sailing
away out of the bolt ropes. Having drawn clear of the cyclone, and the
wind settled down to an honest gale, all hands were set about clearing
up the wreck. Even yet, occasional seas came thundering on board, and a
man caught unawares is quickly apt to lose the number of his mess--in
other words, be washed overboard. Hundreds and hundreds of fathoms of
rope to be hauled in through the wash deck ports and scuppers,
disentangled from round spars; ripped sails to unbend, and fresh ones
to be sent aloft. Everybody on deck and not a thought of sleep or rest;
hot food, of course, is out of the question. A cyclone always seems a
treacherous sort of beast compared with a good straightforward blow,
that one gets with mountainous but regular seas, off Cape Horn, or
running one's Easting Down, or even in the Western Ocean, where it can
be notoriously spiteful and vicious.</p>

<hr><a name="ch14"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h3>

<h4>&ldquo;SHARKS&rdquo;</h4>

<p>A form of sport that always finds favour in a sailing ship, is
carrying on the eternal warfare with the sailor&rsquo;s hereditary
enemy, old John Shark. The ideal condition is a calm day, with the ship
riding on a sea, probably like glass; just a lazy motion, sufficient to
send the sails slatting gently backwards and forwards up against the
mast. Even from the deck, in these circumstances, the slightest ripple
on the surface of the water is clearly visible and, to the man aloft,
the sea an open page for many miles round. The result is that when John
Shark slips his fin above the water, he is spotted at once.</p>

<p>Directly that sinister black triangle, is seen cutting through the
clear water, then, immediately one hears the cry from some sharp eyed
boy around the cross trees, &ldquo;Shark on the weather beam&rdquo; or
&ldquo;shark ahead&rdquo; as the case may be.</p>

<p>In the discipline of a sailing ship&mdash;which is as strict as that
of a man-o&rsquo;-war&mdash;no other word or indication is permitted;
but this cry conveys all the information required to the watch below,
which is all that is intended. A couple of hands will tumble out with
their shark hook and line, harpoon and grains.</p>

<p>Personally, I never favour the recognised shark hook, a massive
great thing, with a lump of chain attached; in fact, in all my time at
sea, although I have caught scores of sharks, I never caught one with
the recognized shark hook.</p>

<p>What I much preferred was a dolphin hook, three-sixteenth metal and
three inches between barb and shank. The whole of this you can almost
hold in the palm of your hand.</p>

<p>About three feet of stranded wire, seized on to the shank, and a
great hank of boat lacing, or codline, as it is sometimes
called&mdash;not a great deal thicker than heavy brown string, was my
full equipment</p>

<p>The hook, buried in a nice chunk of fat white pork about the size of
one&rsquo;s fist, trailed out astern, made a most attractive bait, with
no sign of hook or line. The next thing was to throw out a few scraps
of pork, to draw him and his pilot fish close up towards it.</p>

<p>A shark has very poor sight, but he makes up for it with instinct,
which on occasions, I have seen used with terrible exactitude. His
pilot fish, a bit bigger than a mackerel, and striped like a zebra will
go up and nose round, but for some reason, will never touch the bait.
It is not certain what, if any, message they convey to the shark, but
the fact remains, if they do not approve of the morsel, the shark will
hardly ever touch it. It is by no means every shark that is accompanied
by pilot fish. In any case, he will snap up the odd outlying bits, and
head up for the bigger lump, which he takes in his stride.</p>

<p>A shark&rsquo;s mouth is right underneath, but that does not compel
him to turn on his back to everything. More often than not, he will
just slide his nose over it, or, at the most, turn on his side. God
knows, they can do enough damage without turning over, and I have seen
a man&rsquo;s leg go, like snapping a carrot; the whole thing done with
such horrible quickness, the man hardly knew it was gone. This seems
barely conceivable, but it must be realised that a shark&rsquo;s tooth
is sharper than an ordinary razor, and has a cutting surface that can
only be believed when experimented with. The edges consist of extremely
fine serrations, which easily wear down, but though the shark wears out
one set of teeth, that in no way bothers him, for he quickly grows
another row, and you can catch them with three, five, and even seven or
more rows. I have taken one shark tooth between my fingers, and drawn
it firmly and quickly down a <i>Strand Magazine</i>, and cut clean
through seven pages. This will give some idea of what our friend can
do, when backed up by the enormous muscles, attached to his
tremendously powerful jaws.</p>

<p><br>
 However, to go back to the catching of our old enemy. Having gathered
up the outlying bits, if you have not aroused his suspicions, he will
come along and quickly take the baited hook in his mouth. It is just
here, that fisherman versus shark is put to the test. If you let him
swallow the bait, he will snap your wire; if you only let him get the
bait between his lips, and hold it there, as he often will, when you
strike you will either pull the bait out, or your hook will go through
the flesh, which easily tears away.</p>

<p>You must let him get it down to the corner of his mouth, where it
hooks into the gristly portion of the muscles at the joint of his jaws,
and then you have got him for a certainty. At the first jerk he
commences to dive, but he never goes down far, and you have just got to
get that strain on this small line&mdash;regardless of the burns it
causes through running out through your fingers&mdash;until you can
bring him up again, and his nose above the water, Having got him there,
and the stern of the ship (from which all shark fishing takes place)
not rising and falling too heavily, it is not a difficult matter then
to hold his nose up and drown him. Most species are not only cowards,
but are extraordinarily easily drowned by lifting and dropping their
heads, and so forcing the water in through their gills.</p>

<p>If you want a downright good tussle, where you are pretty certain to
leave lots of skin on the line, hook a 15 ft. tiger shark. He will give
you all the fun you want. I still carry marks on my hand, left by the
teeth of one of this breed&mdash;even after he had been landed on deck,
and his head cut off.</p>

<p>He was the Captain&rsquo;s catch, and to make doubly sure had had a
harpoon driven home; otherwise I don&rsquo;t think we could have
possibly got him on board. He fought like a fiend, and as he came over
the tail amidships, lashing and snapping, his first accomplishment was
to take a piece out of the Captain&rsquo;s arm. Admittedly it was not a
very big piece, but it was sufficient to be uncomfortable for many days
to come. He landed on deck with a crash, and immediately sunk his teeth
into a spare topmast, lying on deck. The carpenter was standing by with
his axe; as, the first job, when you get one of these fighters, is to
lop off his tail. After dancing round for about fifteen minutes, Chips
at last managed to get his tail where he wanted it, and off it came. It
was not a difficult matter then to get him steadied down, and have his
head off.</p>

<p>One chap went to turn the head over with his foot, and immediately
the jaws closed on it. Fortunately, his boot was unlaced, and he was
able to kick it off and so save his toes.</p>

<p>One foolish first voyager drew his sheath-knife, and before anyone
could stop him&mdash;in an act of joking bravado said,
&ldquo;You!&rdquo; and attempted to drive his knife into the
shark&rsquo;s body. An ordinary knife will not penetrate shark skin, so
the result was, the blade of the knife stopped, and his hand continued
down, severing all the sinews of the first three fingers of his
hand.</p>

<p>That made two for the hospital, and I made the third, for whilst
getting hold of the head, and standing it on end, I&rsquo;m hanged if
the jaw didn&rsquo;t snap, and catch my fingers, and it was some time
before we could prise the mouth open and release them.</p>

<p>There is only one safe thing to do when getting one of these
warriors on deck and that is to dislocate his jaws at once&mdash;which
we had foolishly omitted to do.</p>

<p>It is no child&rsquo;s play catching sharks, particularly when
carried out on the slippery decks of a ship, but such is the feeling
between sailor and shark that a man will always willingly lose his
watch below to terminate the existence of one of these wretched
beasts.</p>

<p>The tales one could tell of the horrors of men falling overboard,
sometimes unthinkingly dangling their legs in the water from a stage,
sometimes taking a chance and going for a swim, when to all intents and
purposes it seems impossible for a shark to be within miles; even on
the beaches, children paddling, have been taken. Incidents of this kind
could be multiplied indefinitely, but it is doubtful if it would make
good reading.</p>

<p>Frequently, these sharks are so ferocious that when hungry they will
fight, and often tear each other to pieces. I have caught them with
huge gashes, and the scars of old wounds, inflicted in one of these
furious fights.<br>

<h4>I GET MY &ldquo;TICKET&rdquo;</h4>

<p>Soon after our arrival in Calcutta four of us were &ldquo;out of our
time,&rdquo; or apprenticeship, and fully qualified, as far as sea
service went, to face the terrors of the examination room for our
second mate&rsquo;s certificate.</p>

<p>Through the two or three previous years we were supposed to have
swatted up mathematics, navigation, nautical astronomy, seamanship,
Rule of the Road, and all sorts of stuff that the Board of Trade have
concocted to prove the square-rigged, deep-sea mate. By far and away
the majority of which, once the coveted blue paper that entitles you to
the eventual certificate, has been obtained, is stored away, or
forgotten, until the next examination looms up on the mental
horizon.</p>

<p>Calcutta used to have a name for ease in getting through, but when
we faced the music, the new examiner, Captain Jenny, was trying to work
off the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; name, and that in no unmeasured manner. In
fact, he made a well-known boast that he would fail three out of every
four that came up for examination, and, in our case, made good his
boast. Curiously enough, although I was the duffer of the party, I was
the one to get through. Although I had no particular objection to
mathematics and navigation, I was certainly no adept, whereas one of
our chaps, Austin by name, who went up with me, used to work the
ship&rsquo;s position every day, and, with the cussedness of fate, he
was the first to be chucked out. No second chances then.</p>

<p>When the head examiner (Jenny) came in looking at some of the
papers, and I heard him say, &ldquo;Oh, this won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; I
actually laid down my pen, making sure that I was going to be the next
one to close the door from the outside, but it was Dale that took the
count.</p>

<p>However, to make a long story short, Whitney, or Rivetts, as he was
called, weathered the storm that day, but went down the next, leaving
me the sole occupant of the examination room, and no one was filled
with more amazement. Furthermore, I may say, there was some amazement
on board&mdash;not all complimentary&mdash;when it was found out that
<i>I</i>, of all people, had stuck it out and got through.</p>

<p>Officers were scarce in those days, so, with my chest thrown out
like a man, and a real deep sea roll, I went on board a big four master
bound for New York, as a fully fledged Second Mate.</p>

<p>I will pass over the awful blunders I made before I gained any sort
of confidence, and I also will not dwell on the perfectly poisonous
time I experienced that passage. We had a particularly dirty bit of
work as a skipper, and for this reason I am neither going to mention
his name nor the ship&rsquo;s; suffice to say, that the instant she
made fast in New York I hopped ashore and never saw either him or his
ship again. As a matter of fact, she was lost next voyage with all
hands, and I&rsquo;m not surprised for although an accomplished bully,
he was only a &ldquo;fine weather&rdquo; sailor.</p>

<p><br>
 It was getting on for Christmas, so I wanted to get home, but I also
wanted to see New York, as I had heard so much about it. Fortunately, I
was wise enough to visit a post office first, and send my money, such
as it was, home, keeping just sufficient&mdash;as I thought&mdash;to
see me through.</p>

<p>I got in tow with a chap putting up at the same hotel, who had been
sailing out of New York for many years, and what he didn&rsquo;t know
about the under life there, was not worth knowing.</p>

<p>Of course, all this undertow was well known to the police, likewise,
it was common property that you could buy almost anyone in the force or
out of it, from the highest to the lowest. They used to call the places
&ldquo;dives,&rdquo; and, believe me, entering one of these night
haunts, was a dive, morally, intellectually, and physically. In one
place, the <i>pi&egrave;ce de resistance</i> was a butting match
between a goat and a negro. Each was placed on his own side of a ring,
the negro on all fours, facing the goat (very much like a dog fight is
staged) and the goat induced to attack the Negro. At a word, the billy
goat was released, and each bounded towards the other, to meet in the
middle of the ring. The goat broke his neck, and the Negro fell
unconscious to the ground; to the thunderous cheers and shouts of
approval from the onlookers.</p>

<p>Knives, pistols and knuckle dusters were in common use, and applied
on the impulse any moment; or in staged incidents,-- which are best
left to the imagination.</p>

<p>I soon got heartily sick of it all.</p>

<p>After the clean breath of the sea, where everything is open and
above board, where men settle their differences in their bare feet, on
a white deck, with a perfectly good pair of fists, all this gouging,
twisting, and bone breaking left me thoroughly disgusted with the so
called &ldquo;high spots&rdquo; of New York. Anyway, I soon found
myself without money, as I had, to a certain extent, financed my
initiator.</p>

<p>For two days I managed to survive on ten cents, the last of my
wealth.</p>

<p>I had friends in New Jersey, who, having heard that I was putting up
in Brooklyn, had sent me a cordial invitation, but I, little fool that
I was, wanted to see the high lights, so made some half-baked excuses,
which let me out. However, I ate humble pie later on, when, having
expended my last two nickels, on two free lunches, I was left
completely broke. Then I just had to write to these friends and ask
them for a loan.</p>

<p>Previous to this, I had my marching orders from my hotel, and only
saved the situation there by realising that there were such things as
pawnbrokers. In a few minutes I had deposited a very precious telescope
with &ldquo;uncle,&rdquo; and with the proceeds I laid in one enormous
dinner.</p>

<p>My friends, of course, sent me money at once, but by this time, I
was completely fed up with New York, and everything connected with it,
so I returned the loan, picked up my bag, walked on board the first
British ship that I could see, and, with amazing cheek, asked the
Captain to take me home.</p>

<p>He was certainly amused, and pointed out that in the first place, he
was not a passenger ship, and in the second, I didn&rsquo;t look like a
passenger!</p>

<p>I said &ldquo;No, I wanted to work my passage home in time for
Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He talked to me very kindly, and we had a long yarn about where I
had been, and what I had been doing and I also told him on what ship I
had been Second Mate. He said he knew both the ship and her
captain&rsquo;s reputation, and in the end he got up, said nothing, and
walked away, leaving me standing in the middle of the deck. I thought,
&ldquo;Now, what does that mean?&rdquo; and then it dawned on me that
it was a clear invitation to go and bury myself away in some nook or
corner until the ship got to sea. I seized my bag, and made the best
time down to the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle; rolled myself up in a corner,
shoved the bag up in front of me, and hoped for the best.</p>

<p>I must have gone to sleep, for the next thing I remembered was a
voice roaring down the hatchway, &ldquo;All hands on deck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joy. Oh Joy! that did <i>not</i> include me, and I went to sleep
again. Next thing I heard a voice saying &ldquo;that chap must have
gone ashore. He&rsquo;s left a lot of stuff here, what are we going to
do with it?&rdquo; I stuck my head out and replied, &ldquo;You are not
going to do anything with it. You are going to be very nice and leave
it all alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, young fellow, you&rsquo;ll be in for it now.
You&rsquo;d better go and report yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Along many decks. Up many ladders. At last I found myself standing
stiffly to attention in front of the Captain who looked very stern and
unsympathetic. &ldquo;This young man has stowed himself away,
sir,&rdquo; said the Chief Officer. Glowering at me from under his
bushy eyebrows, the Captain barked: &ldquo;Well, what have you got to
say for yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not by the flicker of an eyelid did he admit recognition, and, of
course, I played up. Told my little tale of being paid off in New York,
and going broke; my anxiety to get home and so forth. Then, when the
Captain realised that I was going to make no reference to our meeting
and subsequent long yarn of yesterday, I saw a friendly glint appear in
his eye.</p>

<p>Much to the Chief&rsquo;s astonishment, the Captain&rsquo;s tone
moderated noticeably, as he said, in a resigned tone of voice,
&ldquo;Oh well, I suppose we shall have to take him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were bound for Glasgow, and that trip was my fist taste of
&ldquo;Steam.&rdquo; Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t like it. Good times, good
food. Always sure of your watch below. Yet I loathed the smoke and the
smell, and longed for the towering tiers of bellying canvas, the sound
of water rushing past the scupper holes; in place of the monotonous
clank and bang of machinery. I sadly missed the feel of something
living under my feet. This ship seemed wooden in comparison. Still, I
was not going to grumble on that account. She did me a good
turn&mdash;a very good turn&mdash;and fourteen days later saw us docked
in Glasgow. Without a cent to my name, there was nothing for it, but to
sink my pride and borrow half a crown from my friendly skipper, and
send a telegram home asking for money for my railway fare. This, after
an eighteen months&rsquo; voyage! Such is life at sea. Still, I had a
few pounds tucked away safely in the Post Office at home, but with a
sailor, money is merely earned to spend, and as long as one gets a
reasonable amount of clean enjoyment out of it, what better use can it
be put to?<br>

<h3>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h3>

<h4>FIRE AT SEA</h4>

<p>Next voyage saw me Third Mate of the last of Greenshield, Cowie and
Company&rsquo;s sailing ships. Another big four masted barque, the
<i>Knight of St. Michael</i>. Like so many other firms, they were being
forced into steam.</p>

<p>In the early &lsquo;nineties, when a sailing ship arrived at her
home port, it was still an event, but with the advent of the steamboats
it became merely an incident.</p>

<p>I still retained a good deal of the square-rigged man&rsquo;s
contempt for the steamboat sailor, though, as it proved, it
wasn&rsquo;t going to be long before I was one myself.</p>

<p>We sailed from England in the March of &rsquo;93, and plunged into a
series of gales that became notorious, even for that month of evil
repute. In three weeks, no less than eleven sailing ships had gone to
their last account, between the Scillies and Dungeness, and we should
have added one to their number if we had not been a particularly well
found ship. As it was, I blame the three weeks of battling about in the
Wesern Ocean for our later troubles.</p>

<p>We were loaded with an unromantic cargo of coal, and with the
everlasting working of the ship, there had evidently been just
sufficient friction to cause it to heat up, and eventually catch fire.
When we did get wind of what was going on down below, it was only after
we had been thoroughly smashed on deck. Bulwarks stove in, boats nearly
all gone, and a head wind to beat up to the land.</p>

<p>Had we possessed boats to carry us all it would not have been so
bad, but, situated as we were, if she did go up, there wasn&rsquo;t a
ghost of a chance for a quarter of us. Our one remaining boat, the
pinnace, would just about take twelve, with any reasonable degree of
safety, and that only in a smooth sea. Then the rest would have to make
out as best they could on the cumbersome raft we had put together out
of spare spars. No doubt it would float all right, but the question of
hanging on to it in a breeze was a horse of quite a different
colour.</p>

<p>Then again the pinnace could not stand by the raft. She must shove
off and try to make the land, and find something that would come out
and search for the raft&mdash;and a fine search it would be. No, look
at it anyway you liked, we&rsquo;d about as much chance of surviving as
the sailors&rsquo; proverbial snowball in the lower regions.</p>

<p>The next long drawn out couple of weeks gave us lots of time to
argue it out. It was the only subject we could discuss with any degree
of naturalness. We tried singsongs; but what was the use of trying to
forget it, when, instead of joining in the chorus, a fellow would
casually stroll over, and put his hands on the deck above the fire. Of
course, the singing at once petered out, whilst someone would call out,
&ldquo;Any hotter, Bill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; the casual reply would be, &ldquo;just a
bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did we jump to those braces to trim the yards to each little
variation of the wind? Did we not! And let me say, not only the watch
on deck, but the watch below as well&mdash;in fact there was no watch
below. Neither was there much likelihood of rest during the day, or
sleep at night, with a potential volcano immediately underneath one,
and level betting that if you did sleep, the chances were you&rsquo;d
wake to find yourself rising on the rim, getting a good start
heavenward.</p>

<p>During the last few days the boys nearly grew corns through sitting
on the fore sky sail yard looking for the land, whilst the decks grew
ever hotter and hotter. If it had lasted much longer we should have
been able to dispense with the galley fire altogether. Then, one Sunday
morning, bright and fine, a good stiff and steady breeze came away from
the S.E. sending her through the water at a ten knot clip. But, would
it hold, without hauling into another head wind and the consequent tack
and tack?</p>

<p>Forty-eight hours more and we should sight the land. Every sail was
tended with a care never even lavished on a prospective cup winner!
Tighten up a halyard here. Another pull on a sheet there, till the most
critical eye was satisfied, and we were getting the very last ounce of
speed out of her.</p>

<p>That Monday evening, just on the edge of twilight, when we had
almost given up all hope of seeing anything that night, came the glad
cry, &ldquo;Land-o!&rdquo; and our troubles were nearly over; at least
the chances of being frizzled or starved were. No more need for a look
out aloft. If she could stick it for another few hours, we should be
able to make the shore even with our precious raft.</p>

<p>As the darkness shut down we judged we were close enough in, seeing
that we had no chart of that coast, and the water was shoaling quickly.
Finally, &ldquo;Stand by, halyards and sheets.&rdquo; Then the welcome
order, &ldquo;Lower away and clew up,&rdquo; and down went the anchor.
Nothing mattered now. We could nearly swim ashore. Much too cold for
sharks. All the same, we couldn&rsquo;t see a sign of a town though
Bahia Blanca was marked on the chart as being right on the coast. The
only chart we had was one of the South Atlantic, where a spider could
spread its legs over a hundred miles.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to take the pinnace. Though I tried to
cheer them up by pointing out that if the ship did go up what fun they
could have, running through the surf on the old raft!</p>

<p>At it turned out later, there was a joke on all of us, for just
where we were anchored&mdash;if a S.W. gale came up&mdash;there was
nothing but breakers, that would have extinguished the fire, the ship,
and ourselves included. However, the S.W. gale held off, and we got
ashore through what surf there was, without smashing up the boat.
Having pulled her up high and dry, the Captain and I went off
prospecting.</p>

<p>As a result of beaching her in the surf I had got pretty well
soaked, so I discarded shoes and socks, as the country seemed to
consist of limitless sand and nothing but sand. Not hillocks, or the
ordinary decent sand hills, but sheer precipices of sand with sides
like walls. It made the going rather bad, but we managed to forge ahead
till, eventually, we came across a sharp line of demarcation between
sand and vegetation. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; we thought, &ldquo;this was
fine. Vegetation, now we&rsquo;ll strike something soon.&rdquo; We did,
or rather I did&mdash;prickles! Prickles an inch long, in fact the
first one I trod on felt six inches. I tried picking my way, but it was
no go. I had to sit down and nurse my feet, picking out the spikes.
Then I got the Captain&rsquo;s handkerchief and my own wrapped round
one foot, and a heavy weather cap round the other, and away we went
again. Every now and then in the cussedness of things, either the cap
or the hankies would slip, and I&rsquo;d do a hurried squat.</p>

<p>So it went on. At any rate, we weren&rsquo;t sitting on our tame
volcano! And that was some blessing. We could see the ship every time
we mounted a precipice. Then we both cheered as we sighted some horses,
and made up our minds there and then that we were going to have a ride
until we found habitation, and chance being shot for horse thieves.
Having picked out a likely couple of nags, the Skipper approached his,
whilst I stalked mine. I don&rsquo;t know what aroused my suspicions;
perhaps I had got to recognize a potential volcano when I saw one. Be
that as it may, I felt quite contented to look over my horse&rsquo;s
back from the near side, and at the Skipper and his mount on my off
side. Incidentally, I kept my hands to myself. He clicked his tongue,
and cheerily walked up and put his hand on its withers, stroked and
patted it. That was all right, but he couldn&rsquo;t see what I saw.
Apart from abruptly ceasing his browsing, a distinctly saucy little
look became apparent in that gee gee&rsquo;s eye&mdash;a look
I&rsquo;ve seen before, and sometimes suffered through not having
seen.</p>

<p><br>
 &ldquo;Come on, man,&rdquo; shouted our noble Captain, at the same
time planting his six foot two on the horse&rsquo;s back. That did
it&mdash;sort of put the match where it was wanted&mdash;and up he
went. You might call it a graceful curve; it didn&rsquo;t look it! And
the thud with which he landed on his back fairly shook the ground. I
could not have stopped laughing to save my soul. When the Captain did
get his wind, and could speak, he just grinned and said,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About an hour later we walked up to a hut full of about the most
cheerful looking cut-throats you could meet in any Chamber of Horrors.
Fortunately the Skipper was in uniform, and, as the British Consul said
later, it was that, and that alone, which saved us both, and quite
possibly the ship. They got the idea that he was a one time big feller,
and best left alone. Incidentally, he did not improve his chances by
hauling out a handful of sovereigns and giving an old dame, who
evidently shared the hut, a couple. Then the blokes that were going to
pilot him to Bahia Blanca wanted some, and he cheerily gave them a few.
They were so utterly flabbergasted&mdash;and I was&mdash; that they
never thought of knifing him and taking the lot.</p>

<p>Off he went, on his sixty mile ride to Bahia, whilst I pushed off
back to the boat. I had only to do about ten miles on the back of the
hacksaw they lent me, but that was enough and to spare. I wasn&rsquo;t
a bit surprised to learn later, that, on arriving in Bahia, Captain
Dodd fell off in a dead faint. I should have split up the middle long
before.</p>

<p>I was given half a sheep, as a sort of peace token, I suppose. It
had been killed on the spot, and was still bleeding profusely. This I
had slung across in front of me, and accompanied by three most choice
villains, set off on the return journey to the boat.</p>

<p>These horses are evidently born to walk, my old saw-bones seemed so
anyway; though I will say, the way they could take those precipices of
sand, beat creation, and came very near beating me, and would have
done, most likely if I hadn&rsquo;t just leaned back and unhesitatingly
seized the beast by the tail. Let &lsquo;em laugh, thought I,
it&rsquo;s better than getting mixed up with bleeding sheep, and both
going over his nose. When we arrived on the beach, what with digging
him in the ribs with my bare heels, and whooping and yelling like a Red
Indian, I managed to get up a gait, something of a cross between a trot
and a canter. Whatever the hybrid motion was, the effect was awful, for
every time I came down, he was sure to be in the act of coming up.
This, in conjunction with his serrated vertebrae did not improve
matters. Fortunately I hadn&rsquo;t far to go to fetch the boat. The
combined effect of the fellows lying under her lee was grand</p>

<p>The picture, from their standpoint, was me, bare-back on a horse,
with the bleeding remains of the Skipper hung in front, bawling and
yelling for assistance, whilst being viciously pursued by three
perfectly typical cut-throats.</p>

<p>One could hardly blame them for seizing boat hooks and stretchers to
hold off the attack. I think the old pirates astern of me were
registering astonishment too, but their surprise and amusement was,
that anyone should want a horse to run.</p>

<p>Though we could not speak a word of their lingo, they knew we were
mad Englishmen, and that, I suppose, covered everything. We were soon
very good friends. Seeing the way they had been received, and that in
any case there was nothing worth stealing, they eventually returned to
their respective hutments, whilst we tried to find the soft side of the
perishing cold sand, and so spent the night with one man keeping a
bright look out in case out friends of the sombreros should change
their minds!</p>

<p>In the morning when we got back to the ship, we found the mate had
taken the bull by the horns, and after rigging all the hoses and
buckets available, had whipped off the hatches, and with improvised
smoke helmets, attacked the fire at its base, and got it out; if not
exactly out, at any rate, sufficiently under control for all hands to
get to work, and dig down night and day, until they had got a trunk way
clean through the lower hold. Also, we hammered up the ends of several
lengths of three inch iron piping, after drilling it full of holes.
These we drove down into the coal in different places, and then tucked
the business end of a fire hose. By the time Captain Dodd arrived with
a steam launch&mdash;or as they called it a tug&mdash;the fire
wasn&rsquo;t worrying us a bit. It wasn&rsquo;t out, but we&rsquo;d
definitely got it where we wanted.</p>

<p>With the &ldquo;tug&rdquo; also came a pilot who gave us the cheery
news that if a S.W. gale had by chance sprung up, the whole area where
we&rsquo;d chosen to anchor would have become a mass of breakers.</p>

<p>The next order was to &ldquo;Man the windlass and loose all
sail.&rdquo; We didn&rsquo;t need any hurrying either. The
&ldquo;tug,&rdquo; bless its little heart, took the tow rope, and
promptly got it round her propeller.</p>

<p>Some cheery soul suggested we should hoist her in the davits to
clear it. Meanwhile, instead of towing us, we did the towing, whilst
they cleared the rope, and before that came about we&rsquo;d fetched
the narrow part of the channel, close hauled. We went about, but before
we could get way on her to go about again, she stuck her nose into the
opposite bank, fortunately mud.</p>

<p>With blessings pouring from aloft, we furled all sail, and in case
the reader has forgotten, I&rsquo;ll say again that she was a four
masted barque.</p>

<p>We decided that the function of our little matey, with the smoke and
stink, should in future be confined to just pulling our head round each
time we went about. That seemed a fairly simple proposition, but again
it proved too much.</p>

<p>After getting our nose out of the mud, and once again responding to
the order &ldquo;set all sail&rdquo; (which in the ordinary way, comes
once a passage, and that once is quite enough) we stood over to the
opposite bank, and, of course, rammed that. I&rsquo;ll just say we
again furled all sail and leave it at that. Later, we once again
&ldquo;set all sail.&rdquo; We had steam on deck by now, to the winches
and windlass, otherwise the order would have been futile. The spirit
was willing, all right, but there is even a limit with old shellbacks,
though you would not perhaps think it, to watch them. Anyway,
we&rsquo;d reached that limit, so when she inevitably took the mud
again, and we&rsquo;d got the canvas stowed once more, we decided she
could stay there, till the tide rose and lifted her off. That would be
in the morning, so we hailed our little chum, and told him to come and
tie up alongside. Whether he didn&rsquo;t like being out all night, or
not, I don&rsquo;t know, but anyway the agent who was on board the
little hooker hailed us, and with a very ultra Oxford accent, imparted
the information that they&rsquo;d &ldquo;sprung a leak, and
couldn&rsquo;t pump, unless the main engines were going." (I heard one
of our chaps say that he didn&rsquo;t know she had any, and if those
were the main engines probably the auxiliary would be a foot pump.)</p>

<p>Whether the yarn was rigged on the spur of the moment it is hard to
say, they didn&rsquo;t wait to argue, but hiked off up the river as
hard as they could go. Neither did they show up again, so we remained
at anchor as it was hopeless to attempt to beat up a narrow channel
with a ship of that size.</p>

<p>Later the following day the wind came away light from the S.W. This
was a fair wind, so we up anchor, and under six topsails and foresail
picked our own way with what ought to have been the help of the pilot,
but it wasn&rsquo;t and she soon stuck in the mud again. After that, we
decided to dispense with <i>all</i> local help and rely on our own
instinct and a couple of good lead lines, with the result she was soon
anchored within some ten miles of Bahia. That was as far as we dare go,
till we could get hold of a real live tug. Meantime we must do the
journey, when required, in the one remaining boat. I wasn&rsquo;t
sorry, as it gave me a real good excuse for rigging the pinnace up with
mast, sails, and false keel, all complete. I was always crazy on boat
sailing, anyway.</p>

<p><br>
 One day, coming off with a Mr. Jones, Lloyd&rsquo;s Surveyor, the
Skipper addressed me by name. Lloyds Surveyor pricked up his ears and
said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, Lightoller?&rdquo; I could tell by
the easy way it slipped off his tongue that he&rsquo;d said it many
times before.</p>

<p>Now some ten years previously, a relation of mine, one Charles
Lightoller, had left England (no, not necessarily for the
country&rsquo;s good, though I will admit he was hot stuff) and no
track or trace of him remained. That branch of the family had tried for
years to get some authentic news of whether he was alive or dead; but
the United States had seemingly swallowed him up, when he went in at
New York. I asked the Surveyor whom he had known of that name. Of
course, it was Charles, all right, and not only that but he had died
whilst actually a partner with Jones in that out of the way little spot
in the Argentine of South American (and once again, how small,
etc.).</p>

<p>After six days swinging to an anchor, with always an eye on our
slumbering friend down below, giving him an occasional sousing with the
hoses, along came the s.s. <i>Toro</i> from Buenos Ayres. (sic) A full
blown tug, with no doubt about what he could and would do. He just
kicked up his heels, and stretched out that thirteen inch coir hawser
of ours, till it looked like a fishing line. We could now send the
sails down, and did, gladly. Another couple of hours, and we were
moored alongside the one and only wharf the place possessed. A rickety
contraption at its best. As a precaution we dropped a couple of anchors
just in case we should wake up some bright morning and find ourselves
bound down river with wharf attached.</p>

<p>There is over thirty feet of a rise and fall in the tide, at Bahia,
and as we broke the end of out precious teakwood companion ladder the
first night, to say nothing of a couple of mooring ropes, I, as Third
Mate, took on the night watch. The broken gangway was one reason, and
another was that being a pretty fair shot I was able to keep the ship
supplied with game. I wasn&rsquo;t asked how I managed to stay awake
night and day, so long as no more gangways were broken. Most nights
after everyone was in the hay, I piped down on the galley seat. First,
I led a line from one of the wharf piles in through the scupper holes
in the ship&rsquo;s side, through the scupper hole in the galley, and
made the loose end fast to a pile of kids (double handled tin dishes
the food is carried in). As the ship rose to the level of the wharf, so
the line tightened up and eventually landed all the kids with a mighty
crash on the deck. As an additional precaution, I tied the bare end to
my foot, so I was pretty sure to wake up&mdash;at least at any rate
before I went through the scupper hole. The noise of the kids was
enough to waken the dead, and it always worked.</p>

<p>Then, after slacking up the moorings, and tending the gangway, I was
free again. In this way I scrounged a good few hours&rsquo; unofficial
shut eye. After breakfast, instead of turning in, I made for the
Saldero, where I was certain of a mount and a dog from one of the
Directors&mdash;a Major Dicks. Then, with a gun I had purchased, I hit
the trail for the foot of a low range of hills, where there was heaps
of game. Partridges, also a kind of grouse, and, best of all, a
Martinet; about the size of a Buff Orpington hen, white flesh, and good
eating. I was always sure of enough for at least two good meals for all
hands&mdash;officers and crew. This was good luck for everyone,
including the skipper, for although he lived ashore, it eased his hand
in providing meat.</p>

<p>Ships&rsquo; allowances for food in foreign ports those days were
notoriously low. I suppose owners thought all we had to do was to slip
ashore and pick peaches, bananas, and oranges, to our heart&rsquo;s
content. I expect they also thought that wild pigs came to the foot of
the gangway, or perhaps the galley door.</p>

<p>One day I bagged a wild cat, though it should have bagged me by
rights! I&rsquo;d got tired of the level plain at the foot of the
hills, and started in one day to explore the hills themselves. Mostly
pretty sheer cliffs. Climbing round a particularly awkward bit, I just
got footing on a small plateau, when, at the same time, my long
whiskered friend decided to come out of her lair to see what the row
was about. She put her belly to the ground and waved her wand in an
unmistakable manner. It was a case of who&rsquo;s going to be first;
well, I was, by a split second, which I believe is the shortest
measurement of time. She got both barrels as she rose, and before she
could rise again, the contents of a Derringer I had, by luck, in my
pocket. Dicks fixed the skin up for me at the Saldero, and I think
someone in England still has it.</p>

<p>One night before leaving Bahia Blanca, whilst cruising around the
shore with some of the other chaps, I had the distinction of being
jailed for murder. Just how it came about in the first instance, is
rather difficult to say. We were on the pampas or open plain, and I
somehow or other, lost touch with the other chaps; I suppose I must
have been taking a short cut, and I&rsquo;m afraid my short cuts are
rather notorious. Be that as it may, the fact remains, that I got
completely lost, and to make touch with the others again, as evidently
shouting seemed ineffective, I blew my whistle, the ordinary whistle
that every officer on board ship carries. They answered, and we came
together all right.</p>

<p>We were journeying along in the dark, quite cheerfully, when we
suddenly found ourselves surrounded by gendarmes. What <i>they</i> said
we didn&rsquo;t know and for what <i>we</i> were saying they
didn&rsquo;t seem to care. They went through us each individually, and
pretty effectively, until they came across my whistle, gave a slight
blow on it, gurgled with what might have been anger or
delight&mdash;and about three of them seized me by various portions of
my anatomy and shuffled me off, just as hard as they could go. Our
other fellows naturally thought, &ldquo;Here, this won&rsquo;t
do,&rdquo; when they saw me vanishing into the dark, and several of the
gendarmes soon found themselves sprawling on the ground. This added to
the fun, and also fuel to the fire, for more gendarmes seemed to spring
up out of the ground. In any case, they were on us like a shot. We got
a downright sound whacking, with the flat of their swords, and I was
pushed into a tin tabernacle they called the jail. It behoved one not
to be too violent, or, judging from appearances, and the way it swayed,
the whole thing would come clattering down.</p>

<p>There were two or three drunks sharing the cell, and I passed an
interesting hour or so until the other chaps routed out the British
Consul, who gave me back my whistle and my freedom. The only fact that
I could sort out from a jumbled up story was that a man that night had
committed a murder, and he had a whistle. Heaven help the whistlers on
a night like that!<br>

<h3>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h3>

<h4>THE NITRATE COAST</h4>

<p>It was in Bahia I got promotion, and once again found myself second
mate of a three skysail yarder. It happened through the appointed
second mate going on a terrific binge. He was an awfully good chap, and
a splendid sailor, but a bit wet.</p>

<p>Scores come a cropper the same way, though in the aggregate they
consume less alcohol than their prototype ashore.</p>

<p>The fact is, that through months of enforced abstinence, a sailor
becomes very susceptible to the effects of drink and if he has any
weakness in that way, he is fairly sure to come a cropper in the long
run.</p>

<p>Having discharged part of the cargo and completely extinguished the
fire, we eventually battened down the hatches again towed down river
and, with the remainder of the cargo sailed for Iquiqui (sic) on the
Nitrate Coast.</p>

<p>It was a grand feeling, and one I thoroughly enjoyed, having once
again a big ship with her mountains of towering canvas under my sole
charge during my watch. One never tires of the bright moonlight nights
such as one experiences in the tropics. So bright that it is dangerous
to sleep in the full glare of the moon without shelter of some kind.
The phosphorus in the water is sometimes dazzling as the ship cuts her
way; so bright, in fact that I have actually read a piece of newspaper
by the light of the phosphorus alone, stirred up by the rudder. Of
course, by moonlight such as I speak of, in the tropics, it is quite
easy to see to read; every rope and every rope yarn is picked out like
a clear sharp etching. The truck, although over 200 ft. away, can be
seen with absolute distinctness, waving in lines across a sky literally
smothered in stars. Here and there the deep vast purple between the
constellations is only made the deeper by their particular
brightness.</p>

<p>To watch such a star as Sirius setting, is almost like looking
through a kaleidoscope of boyhood memories. It resembles nothing better
than a huge lamp, changing colour second by second through every hue,
purple, crimson, blue, red. But it must be seen to be appreciated, and
then only in the tropics. I&rsquo;ve known many an old shell wax poetic
over the glories of one of these tropical nights.</p>

<p>We made our way once again round the Horn and up to Iquiqui, where
tier on tier of ships were loading nitrate for Home and the Continent.
The nitrate is brought off in lighters, loaded with sacks, each
weighing exactly two hundredweight. These are hoisted on board by a
dolly-winch manned by half a dozen men, or, if the ship sports the
luxury, a steam winch. A platform is built down below, and the whole of
the ship is loaded by a single native Chilean, from this platform,
which must be adjusted to this man&rsquo;s height to an inch. These
huge sacks, after being hove up and landed on the platform are placed
on this man&rsquo;s back and dropped by him in tiers in the hold, and
once dropped, never touched again. Of course, nitrate is a terrific
weight, and a ship cannot be anything like filled with it. In fact,
both in the lower hold, and &lsquo;tween decks, there are just a couple
of pyramids. It is terribly hard on the ship, and causes the sides to
buckle in, with the result that all rigging has to be taken up when
loading, and eased out when discharging. The man&rsquo;s back that
carries these sacks is like a piece of leather, and after handling that
dolly-winch for a couple of months, one&rsquo;s hands become
likewise.</p>

<p>One meets every type and description of ship, and of all
nationalities, loading nitrate, and one notorious Yankee hard-case
ship, the <i>Frederick K. Billings</i>, lay next to us. They lived like
fighting cocks, as far as food goes, and made our British ships
resemble second rate soup kitchens, but oh! they did have to work for
their living. It was a common rumour that many of her crew had
definitely decided they would not sail in her, but to the ordinary
mind, it seemed as though they had no alternative. The inhospitable
bleak cliffs of that nitrate coast could afford little shelter to a
goat, let alone a ship&rsquo;s crew. However, they solved the problem
and in a pretty drastic manner.</p>

<p>On gala nights the custom is to set fire to a 2 cwt. bag of
saltpetre on the beach, and the light from this will illuminate the
whole harbour, the heat generated being simply terrific. Imagine then
the <i>Frederick K. Billings</i> when, after making all preparations to
take to the boats, one of the crew dropped a paraffin lamp down the
fore hatch. The ensuing blaze beggars description. In precisely sixteen
minutes, that ship was burnt to the water&rsquo;s edge (decks, masts,
yards, sails and rigging) and had sunk to the bottom; but not before
she had burnt every vestige of paint off that side of the ships
immediately adjacent to her, ruined all their running gear, and reduced
them to a piebald wreck. The crew of the burning ship had just time to
leap overboard and swim for it. Most of them were picked up, and in the
ordinary run of things, handed over to the authorities&mdash;a
proceeding they considered infinitely preferable to sailing under their
bucko Yankee mates.</p>

<p>This happened in Iquiqui, which also has the distinction of having
produced an island from the sea in one night, and in consequence is
named Iquiqui Island. Unfortunately it rose under a ship at anchor, and
her remains are still visible, and will remain visible for many years
to come.</p>

<p>A little further up the coast, at the Port of Pisagua, the operation
was reversed, and one can now sail in a small boat over the houses of
the old town, which quietly subsided into the sea one night, also as
the result of one of the frequent earthquakes.</p>

<p>Although we had to work like niggers all the week, Sunday, as often
as not would see us away in one of the ship&rsquo;s boats fishing and
shooting, in fact it had to be a busman&rsquo;s holiday for there was
little or nothing else to do, certainly not in the town, and less
outside of it. It is a bleak barren coast all right; where trees
don&rsquo;t grow, and the rain never rains&mdash;in fact it is a common
saying that a good tropical shower would do more damage than a
fire.</p>

<p>Anyhow, a good boat and a good crew, complete with harpoon, grains
and rifles was more in our line. Bar seals, all was fish that came to
our nets, whether herrings, rock cod, sharks or the occasional sword
fish&mdash;and he is a fighter of the first water.</p>

<p>Half a stick of dynamite was the best negotiator for rock cod.
Herrings often come in in shoals so thick that the top layers are
pushed completely out of the water. Then you bale &lsquo;em up with a
bucket. If they are running deep, then you send a charge of dynamite
well down. If they are only a couple of fathoms down, a good method is
to tie a piece of stick on to one end of, say three fathoms of twine
(and don&rsquo;t forget for a moment that a fathom is six good feet),
then tie the stick of dynamite on to the other end.</p>

<p>To prepare the charge, you push a hole down the stick of dynamite
with a pencil. Then take a detonator, and insert the end of the fuze.
Carefully nip the sides of the detonator with your teeth, at the same
time bearing in mind that if the detonator does go off it will blow the
top of your head off. Then with the fuze, push the detonator into the
dynamite, and hope for the best. Light the fuze, throw it overboard and
stand by, but don&rsquo;t do like the mate of the <i>Thistle</i>, stand
with your foot on the twine, or, as in his case, the charge will
naturally jerk back on board. Like a sportsman, he grabbed the dynamite
again, despite the spluttering fuze, and tried another shot, but this
time he had got a complete turn round his ankle, and when he got that
clear he was only just able to put the skylight between him and the
charge, before there was a neat hole blown clean through the deck, and
every scrap of crockery and glass in the pantry underneath was
shattered to fragments. What the steward had to say when he realised
that the top of his head might have been just where the hole appeared,
is not printable. When this occurred the <i>Thistle</i> was lying in
the next tier to us.</p>

<p>So much for herrings</p>

<p>This Sunday in particular, we were after bigger fry, and hooked a
tartar. We&rsquo;d sailed well clear of what goes by the name of the
harbour (only really there isn&rsquo;t any) when we saw a fin above the
water, and at once jumped to the conclusion that it was our old enemy
John Shark. Everyone laid back to their oars, and we rapidly closed on
the fin, which my subconscious mind already told me, was attached to no
shark.</p>

<p>However, it was a fin, and a big one, and that was good enough. As
we drew closer I gave the order &ldquo;Way enough; lay in the bow
oar.&rdquo; The bow oarsman then took his stand in the eyes of the
boat, with the harpoon in his hand, and the rest laid on their oars.
With the way we had on the boat, she ran close up, and then the bow
oarsman let fly making an excellent shot, burying the harpoon just
abaft the fin. We knew instantly that we had tackled something tough,
for although a shark at times will put up a pretty good fight, it was
nothing compared with the fuss this chap made. Out flew the line and
down he went, in fact it was some time before we could snub up enough
and make him tow us. He made straight out to sea, at the rate of knots.
After ten minutes or so he eased up, and came to the surface. Then we
could see it was no shark indeed, but a fifteen foot swordfish.
Carefully hauling on the line we managed to get a rifle shot in, and
away he went for another stretch, but it was soon evident that the
bullet, by luck, had done the trick.</p>

<p>Now a sword fish, in its last throes, has a nasty habit of coming up
right under a boat. We were aware of this, and a couple of us were
peering over the side down into the water. We saw him coming but
couldn&rsquo;t stop him, and he drove his sword right through the
bottom of the boat, actually grazing the back of the stroke oarsman. We
were then in a nice mess, some ten miles away from the ship, and a 15
ft. swordfish securely attached to the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to lash mast and oars together, in the
form of a raft, take the plug out of the boat, and let her fill. Then
get over the side and dive down, and make a line fast round his tail.
Taking this line over the raft of mast and oars, we pulled his tail up
to the surface, and at the same time, turned the boat on her side. With
the help of the boat&rsquo;s axe, we hacked the sword short off at the
snout, righted and baled out the boat. Well satisfied with the trophy,
for our trouble, despite the ten mile pull back.</p>

<p>Eventually the great day comes when the cargo is all stowed and the
ship is down to her marks. An age old custom on the Nitrate Coast
before breaking moorings, is to cheer each ship in the harbour. A
spokesman is chosen who usually has a voice like a full-toned foghorn.
He faces the ship hailed and calls &ldquo;Three cheers for such and
such ship.&rdquo; The crew let go like one man, and the ship cheered
must reply, though she may be the best part of a mile a way, and woe
betide her if she does not pick up her name, and reply in time; for all
the ships round about, that have spotted this lack of attention, join
in raising loud groans, and to hear the weird reverberating
echo&mdash;particularly noticeable at night time&mdash;of a dozen or
more ships&rsquo; crews groaning, is a thing never to be forgotten. The
ship &ldquo;groaned&rdquo; never forgets it either. Once
&ldquo;groaned&rdquo; it is then too late for her to answer the cheers
of the hailing ship; she has just to grin and bear it, and to stand the
chaff for evermore. It is looked on as a terrible disgrace, and years
afterwards, some of the crew, in some outlying port of the world will
mention the ship they are from, and somebody will at once say,
&ldquo;Oh yes, you were &lsquo;groaned&rsquo; in Iquiqui, on such and
such a date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finished loading, then comes the great affair of breaking moorings,
for here one is moored fore and aft. Each ship in the harbour sends
over a few men, and it is a whole day&rsquo;s job to get up the stern
moorings, get the cable forward, shackled on again and hove in. Every
bit of the work has to be done by hand, and when it is taken into
consideration that every link of the chain , of which there may be
fifty or sixty fathoms, weighs anything up to ten or fourteen pounds,
it will be realised that it is no joy ride. At last it is completed,
sail is set, and the ship quickly slips over the horizon.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h3>

<h4>DERELICTS</h4>

<p>As it turned out, this was to be my last voyage in sail, and will
always stand out as being the very worst. The passage out consisted of
a series of gales topped off with a fire. Whilst on the homeward voyage
we never had the skysails in once, except as a matter of form off the
Horn; 165 days from Iquiqui to the Lizard (Cornwall). Six weeks in the
Doldrums where it rained so incessantly that we had the oil completely
washed off our oilskins. Five times we crossed the line, to-day a mile
or two north, to-morrow, we had drifted south again; next day further
south, then north again and so on, till we were like jellyfish. Bad
weather may be bad, but too much so-called good weather, is I think,
worse. Particularly when it means, as in the Doldrums, hauling and
pulley hauling the yards round day after day, and night after night,
till, as in our case, the crew got absolutely exhausted. However, all
good things must have an end, as ours did with a flicker of wind from
the N.E. Round came the yards once again and, for the hundredth time,
the hope that it might be the true N.E. Trades, and, this time, it was.
Why I say true Trades is because one often picks up the false N.E.
Trades even south of the Line, and again you&rsquo;d get the Portuguese
trades sometimes 35&deg; and even 40&deg; north of the Line, which may
develop into the true Trades of the Tropics and good old flying fish
weather. As a matter of fact, they remained only too true, and in
consequence, worked us away to the westward, so that we were well over
to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>On this voyage I caught what I firmly believe to be the first
specimen ever known of a fish with hands and feet. The head winds had
forced us over towards the Gulf until we were well within the region of
the well-known &ldquo;Gulf Weed&rdquo; almost identical in appearance
with mistletoe. This weed flows out of the Sargasso Sea, and originated
the old tale of ships which become embedded in acres and acres of this
weed, to turn slowly round and be steadily, but surely, drawn to the
centre of the much feared sea, until at last, with provisions and water
all gone, they become derelicts, continuing their everlasting circling
through the ages. One almost regrets that the steamer has torn that
theory all to pieces, as they crossed and recrossed the dreaded
Sargasso Sea with ever sighting any legendary and seaweedy island.</p>

<p>In point of fact derelict ships never remain stationary either in
the Sargasso or any other sea. There is a continual flow, mainly due to
the currents set up by the revolution of the earth, and the retarding
action of the water. The earth, moving round to the eastwards, tends to
leave the water behind it, and promptly sets up what is called the
Equatorial Current, which has its origin around the Line on the Coast
of Africa. This flows to the westward, increasing in momentum till it
strikes the north coast of South America, and flows north into the
Caribbean or Sargasso Sea, through the Gulf of Mexico, circling round
and flowing out through the Staits of Florida; thus forming the Florida
and Counter-Equatorial Current, and flowing back again to the westward,
and bringing into existence the great Gulf Stream, which strikes the
coast of England, and to which we owe our much maligned climate. A
split in the Gulf Stream takes place off the Coast of Ireland, one part
going south, forming the Reynolds Current&mdash;one of the most erratic
in the world. The other branch goes north, making the Arctic Current
and coming to the Coast of Newfoundland in the guise of the Labrador
Current, bringing with it thousands upon thousands of icebergs. In
fact, one theory regarding the formation of the great Banks of
Newfoundland, is that they have been caused by the deposit from
icebergs, which were originally glaciers, and brought with them,
through the countless ages millions of tons of earth. The icebergs, on
striking the warm water, are alleged to melt, and deposit their
material at the bottom of the sea. Whatever the truth, the Banks are
certainly very much in evidence, and form a happy hunting ground for
cod, fog and icebergs.</p>

<p>The smaller currents are unfortunately the most erratic, and
don&rsquo;t help matters when trying to make a decent landfall. About
the worst culprit is the Reynolds Current, which flows across the mouth
of the English Channel. A heavy south-westerly gale in the Bay of
Biscay will set this chap running like a mill race in the wrong
direction. One of our crack Atlantic Liners (I won&rsquo;t mention
names) coming home from New York; instead of being well south of the
Scillies, found herself north of these islands, and sighted the Seven
Stones Lightship. This, despite the fact that the Captain was one of
the most able and careful navigators on the North Atlantic. A glance at
the map will show what a narrow shave she had.</p>

<p>Apart from icebergs, another inducement for the sailor to keep his
eyes skinned is derelicts, that have been known to drift about the
world for years, covering thousands of miles. Individually, they are a
worse danger than icebergs. Often they are nothing but waterlogged and
dismasted old Nova Scotia schooners loaded with timber, just floating
awash, and utterly impossible to sink, but able to rip the bottom out
of any unwary liner. It is by no means uncommon for the hull of a
dismasted ship to float, for weeks and even months, with the remains of
her crew, unmanageable, and unnavigable, with limited provisions and no
means of communication. If she has been dismasted anywhere near the
Line, she is fairly sure to find her way into the Great Caribbean Sea,
or the Gulf of Mexico, where she may circle and circle indefinitely. On
the other hand she may, with luck, come out on the Florida Current, but
long ere this happens, only a few pitiful skeletons remain to tell the
story.</p>

<p>But to get back to my walking fish.</p>

<p>I had succeeded in collecting a good many specimens from the
floating Gulf Weed when one of the watch below, lying around on the hot
decks, pointed out a fish that I had missed lying hidden under the
fluke of the starboard anchor. I picked it up and popped it in my
aquarium, which consisted of an old five gallon kerosene tin. After a
time, the peculiar action of the fish, caught my eye. It sort of sidled
up alongside a piece of weed, and remained stationary, without moving
its fins. My curiosity was aroused, so I got the cap off the end of a
telescope and filled it with water, and examined the little beggar
closely with a magnifying glass. Sure enough, it had tiny, but fully
developed hands and feet. Actually, the fish was slightly flat, and
swam on its edge. The arms out of each side consisted of a transparent
fin-like substance. This formed the lower part of an arm and ended in a
perfect little hand with five fingers. Little flat legs of a similar
nature, but just from the knees down&mdash;folded up underneath the
body, when it went to the bottom of the tin the legs came down and it
stood on its feet, or it would rise alongside a branch of weed, and
deliberately grip hold of it with its hands and hang on.</p>

<p>It dawned on me that this must be a very rare specimen, and I set
out to try and find some methylated spirit or anything else in which to
pickle it.</p>

<p>None to be got. &ldquo;Try whisky,&rdquo; said one humorist, and I
even had the temerity to suggest to the Captain that he should give me
some whisky, as there was no methylated spirits, but I, with the fish,
was consigned to places even hotter than the Gulf of Mexico.
&ldquo;Fish with hands and feet,&rdquo; snorted the autocrat of the
sea. &ldquo;Get out of this, or I&rsquo;ll pickle you.&rdquo; I fled
back to my precious fish, to find that some crabs had solved the
difficulty by eating it!</p>

<p>For many years I stood the jeers of all and sundry that listened to
this fish yarn, but I got my own back when, in the usual scare
headlines of a New York paper, they informed the world, that the
&ldquo;First known specimen of a fish with hands and feet had been
discovered and brought home by the Captain of a steamer.&rdquo; As far
as I know the &ldquo;only specimen&rdquo; is still swimming round quite
happily in the New York aquarium.</p>

<p>Within a hundred miles of the spot where I got my fish I also saw
what is believed to be the biggest shark in the world.</p>

<p>I had the forenoon trick at the wheel. She was steering easy
&ldquo;By the wind,&rdquo; just moving through the water.</p>

<p>I momentarily dropped my eyes from watching the weather leech of the
mizzen royal, and glanced over the rail to leeward, and saw, what at
first I took to be a blackfish. Still I knew it couldn&rsquo;t be that
from the fin and the colour, and then it dawned on me it was a shark.
But, my godfathers, what a shark! I let out a yell, &ldquo;Shark on the
lee beam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Captain was on the weather side of the poop at the time, and ran
over to leeward and saw it.</p>

<p>There was certainly no shark hook or line in the whole wide world
that would hold this chap, so the Captain dashed into the chart room
for a rifle, and snatching one out of the rack, slipped in a cartridge,
came out on deck and fired. I doubt if the bullet took any effect, but
before he could reload, Tiger Jim had disappeared.</p>

<p>I believe to this day that it was Tiger Jim, a well-known shark that
had been sighted by sailing ships again and again in those waters, and
he never leaves them. He is nearly as well known as Pelorus Jack, the
porpoise (and the only fish individually protected by Government!) that
used to pilot ships through the Cook Straits.</p>

<p>Reports as to Tiger Jim&rsquo;s size vary. Some went up as far as
thirty-six feet but as luck would have it we got a first class
opportunity of measuring him. When I saw him, and recovered from the
shock, his tail was just abreast of the wheel. When the Captain ran
across the forward end of the poop Tiger Jim&rsquo;s nose was just
level with the forward &lsquo;thwartship rail. In this manner we
arrived at a very accurate estimate, and it came out at exactly
thirty-one feet, and he could have taken a full grown calf at a
mouthful!</p>

<p>On our long passage home&mdash;165 days from land to land&mdash;I
came to seriously consider the advantages and disadvantages of
&ldquo;sail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If one ever could tear away from the never ending glamour and
romance, the ever close and intimate association with those utterly
absorbing, revelations of the deep sea, then common sense said
&ldquo;steam.&rdquo; But the soul of any square rigged sailor in the
&lsquo;nineties revolted at the prosaic monotony one coupled with a
steamboat. Still, anyone with an inch of foresight, knew well that sail
was on the wane. Steam had come and come to stay.</p>

<p>One might as well make up one&rsquo;s mind to stow away the hard-
learned lore of sailing ship days and let it become just a treasured
memory, and turn to the machinery of modern times.</p>

<p>It was a bitter pill, but I swallowed it with the best grace I could
find and became a &ldquo;steamboat sailor,&rdquo; so that frequent term
of ineffable contempt, would now apply to me! However, I stuck to my
guns and said good-bye to the good old windjammers that I loved.<br>
</p>

<h3>CHAPTER NINETEEN</h3>

<h4>&ldquo;BULLY&rdquo; WATERS</h4>

<p>I soon found myself third mate of a Western Ocean Packet, bound
across the Pond. No more watching every vagary of the wind, no more
luffing up to a squall and easing her away as she would bear it. Never
again to hear the music of that gurgling hiss, as the water skirls in
the scupper holes. How one was to miss that straining heel as she laid
her lee rail down to the water, with the welcome sound of ropes surging
and cracking, or even the well-known cry as the strain increases,
&ldquo;Stand by the royal halyards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, three watches, and when a squall is in the offing,
&ldquo;Quartermaster, pull the dodger up, please.&rdquo; Nothing to do
but keep a sharp look-out. All the driving done for one by the
stokehold gang below. Just the steady plug and thud of the engines;
into one sea, and through the next. No quick downward flick of the
wheel, as she lifts her head to crash down into the trough, like the
way one nursed a sailing ship. I tried it on a steamer, but it
hadn&rsquo;t the slightest effect; the only way with a steamer is to
ease her engines. In fact, one seems wholly dependent on the
engines.</p>

<p>We were bound up the St. Lawrence, and in those days ten knots was
considered quite a good speed. In many places in the St. Lawrence, such
as the Racine Rapids, and even up at Montreal, before the revetment was
built, I have seen the ship doing her ten knots and barely making
headway. Even alongside at Montreal, the engines had to be kept going
at very nearly full speed whilst the ship was made fast, with the
result that owing to the huge head of steam, the moment the engines
were stopped, the safety valves lifted, and the row for the next half
an hour or so was simply deafening.</p>

<p>I soon began to see that steam had its good points&mdash;lots of
them. Better time, better food, better pay, and one did not lose touch
so completely with the world.</p>

<p>Had I been of a steady disposition and stayed in Elder Dempsters,
where I started in steam, no doubt I should have got to the top of the
tree very quickly, but for one thing I was not steady, and for another,
it was only the tallest tree that would satisfy me. Time and again I
took to the beach on some hair-brained stunt or other, just wasting
time; spending months shooting or fishing, until funds petered out.
Then off to the sea again, in the first company that would take me. Get
through an examination, and then have another glorious binge&mdash;not
a boozing binge&mdash;for I&rsquo;ve a whole-hearted contempt for the
chap who takes more than he can hold.</p>

<p>It was after one of these little breaks that I found myself in the
African Royal Mail s.s. <i>Niagara</i>, bound down the Coast of West
Africa, under that notorious and well-known Captain who glorified in
the name of Bully Waters, a man of such exceeding unpopularity that his
life would not have been worth a minute&rsquo;s purchase in the streets
of Liverpool. To even cross the town he invariably took a cab for
safety&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll admit he needed it. He made an open boast
that he had killed two men, though in point of fact, he didn&rsquo;t
actually kill them, but, owing to his perpetual bullying and driving,
he was the moral cause of one man committing suicide, while the other
chap just died, and though malaria went down in the log, that
wasn&rsquo;t the real cause.</p>

<p>When one takes into consideration the enervating climate, the
terrific heat, heavy work, unquenchable thirst, and withal a skipper
who could literally wear the sole off a sea boot, it is easy to
understand a man lacking a bit perhaps in courage and strength of
character, just cracking up completely. Bully Waters seemed to have the
natural born ability to taunt and torment men to the limit of their
endurance; as a rule just stopping short of the point were a man loses
control. Why no one ever brained the beast puzzles me.</p>

<p>A double crew is carried on these boats, one part white to work the
ship, the second part of negroes to work the cargo. These latter are
trained to handle the cargo peculiar to the West Coast, both
discharging and loading. Work commences about 5 a.m. and Waters on
principle, would visit every hatch, quarrel, annoy and thoroughly put
every officer on edge, and then, having set everybody by the ears,
retire happily to his cabin, have a drink, and go off to sleep
again.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions we were part loaded with about twenty tons
of explosives, mainly gunpowder. This had to be discharged at a place
called Borutu, and it happened to be at my end of the ship, stowed in a
specially built-in magazine. Embarking this cargo at Liverpool, every
possible precaution is taken as a matter of form, such as men wearing
rubber boots, every particle of iron work carefully covered up, and the
kegs handled gingerly from man to man, until they eventually arrive,
and are stowed away in the magazine; whilst, at the masthead, high
above all, the powder flag flies. When we arrived at the port of
discharge, although we did not trouble to cover up the iron, nor adopt
rubber boots, still powder is powder, and has to be treated with a
certain amount of respect. Our &ldquo;boys&rdquo; passed it up by hand
via wooden stages, and placed it on the deck, whilst it was taken from
overside by a company of West African Housas (one of the finest
fighting races in Africa). The latter had a stage rigged which brought
with them from the shore to the ship and breast high with our deck.
These men are born scrappers, and it was only by using the utmost tact
that peace was kept between the Sierra Leone boys, belonging to the
ship, and the Housas belonging to the shore. At any time the slightest
carelessness on the part of one of our boys, say dropping a keg on one
of a Housa&rsquo;s toes, would, as likely as not, end up in a free for
all tribal fight, which would take the whole of the white men on board
to put a stop to, and that only after some few had been knocked
out.</p>

<p>We were already labouring under these conditions, when Bully Waters
must come along and raise Cain about the &ldquo;slowness with which the
explosives were being discharged. These early morning efforts
invariably ended in a wordy war, for I could cuss just as long and loud
as he could&mdash;and did. Work was going on all right, and skipper or
no skipper I was not going to be bullied by him or anyone else. A very
effective method I found for dealing with him was to deliberately stop
all work, and give him my whole attention. Not edifying, it's true, but
it used to do the trick, and did on this occasion. When he had finally
retired, Massey, the fourth officer, and I put our heads together and
decided to give him all he was asking for. So a half ton iron tub was
procured from forward, and every scrap of care just thrown to the wind.
The boys were worked up&mdash;as it is always possible to work up any
of these West African tribes by telling off one boy to beat a tom-tom,
until they were just dancing in a frenzy of excitement. The half ton
tub was loaded up, by simply hurling in kegs of powder until it would
hold no more; many hitting the lip of the tub, and bursting scattered
powder everywhere. Up went the tub, off with the catch, crash came the
whole half ton of powder kegs on deck, to be simply torn away in bulk,
and almost thrown at the Housas who were waiting overside. These Housa
boys also soon got wound up to the dancing stage of excitement. Powder
above, powder below, powder everywhere. It was not long before
everybody connected with the ship found a reasonable excuse to park
themselves on shore, as far away from the ship as they could get.</p>

<p>A certain amount of zest was added, by the fact that the s.s.
<i>Matade&rsquo;s</i> bows were even then visible in the Bush, as a
result of discharging a similar cargo in the same place, when, even
though infinite care was taken, luck was against them, and up she
went.</p>

<p>I got a certain amount of cussed contentment out of the knowledge
that even Bully Waters dare not come to my end of the ship and show the
white feather by calling a halt, not, on the other hand, dare he funk,
and go on shore. However, she did not blow up, and he gave me a rest
after that, so it was worth it.</p>

<p>I did one more voyage with him, and was not so lucky. Due to his
everlasting bully-ragging I succeeded in drowning three boys and a
quarter-master, and incidentally nearly drowning myself<br>

<h3>CHAPTER TWENTY</h3>

<h4>A SURFBOAT TRAGEDY</h4>

<p>We had arrived off Grand Bassam to take in mahogany logs, but it
happened to be a &ldquo;surf day,&rdquo; and as a result there was no
communication between ship and shore, and no logs could be floated off
to the ship for loading. The question to be settled was, should we stay
in hopes of the weather moderating, or should we push on homeward.</p>

<p>Waters gave the Chief orders to go in with the surf boat, and get in
touch with the shore and find out if they proposed to ship off any
logs. This the Chief proceeded to do; anchoring and trying to signal to
the shore when he was as close to the surf as he could get, with any
degree of safety. Grand Bassam is open to the full force of an Atlantic
swell, and if there is, or has been, a good westerly gale within a few
hundred miles, the sea banks up, with the shoaling water, curling over
as it rushes in, to finally crash down the beach throwing up sheer
volcanoes of surf. To be caught in one of these mountainous breakers,
even a surf boat (double ended like a lifeboat) is almost sure to be
fatal, unless every member of that surf boat&rsquo;s crew is trained to
the last hair, and even then, the chances are odds on being capsized.
Our boys were quite good in the surf boat, but not by a long shot equal
to tackling anything like the sea running that day. Waters sent for me
and asked &ldquo;Why the hell can&rsquo;t the Chief get in touch with
the beach? He&rsquo;s too far out.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, from
where we were it did seem as if he might get closer in. I replied that
&ldquo;although he seemed well clear of the breakers, it was impossible
to form an opinion unless one were to take a boat and see for
oneself.&rdquo; He gallingly sneered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
the blazes you fellows are afraid of,&rdquo; This jeer was calculated
to a nicety, knowing full well that it held just the right sting to
make me carry out any crazy attempt to make touch with the shore.
Naturally my reply was pointed and pungent. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo;
said he, with biting contempt, &ldquo;take the gig and let&rsquo;s see
what <i>you</i> can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like a fool I took the gig, a boat with a square stern, the very
worst type of boat for the work in hand; called away a crew, and off we
went, in full view of the first and second class passengers, many of
whom were witnesses both to the &ldquo;dare&rdquo; and the disastrous
results. They gave their opinions in no measured terms a little later
on, for it all happened within a mile or so of the ship. The
Captain&rsquo;s last instructions were &ldquo;take a lead line, sound
in, and see how far I can bring the ship.&rdquo; This called for a
Quartermaster.</p>

<p>We sounded in as far as was necessary, and then coiled the lead line
down in the stern sheets, and went on to make touch with the Chief.
When we got alongside of him, we found he was riding right on the edge
of the breakers, one instant shooting skyward on the lip of a sea, and
the next, dropping like a stone into the trough. He certainly
couldn&rsquo;t get in any closer. I said I would pull a little way of
the coast and see if I could make contact further along.</p>

<p>Nursing the gig up to the seas, I worked her along the coast line.
One minute we were pulling like mad up the face of a curler, and the
next buried away down out of sight of everything in the trough, and,
all the time, right on the edge of the breakers. Every wave had an ugly
lip to it, and threatened to smash down on us.</p>

<p>With the Quartermaster I tried to signal the shore. This was no easy
matter whilst at the same time keeping just out of the clutches of the
breaking seas. Every now and then, we had to pull her head sharply
round, and work her over a comber that had just reached breaking
point.</p>

<p>What exactly happened in the next few moments I don&rsquo;t know.
Either my attention was drawn too much to the beach, or one sea, out of
pure cussedness, determined to break further out than the others, but
turning my head seaward, I was just in time to look up at a gigantic
comber on the point of crashing down right on top of us. It was
literally over us, and I could see the pale sickly green light of the
sun filtering through the overhanging water, some fifteen feet above
us.</p>

<p>I gave the order sharply to &ldquo;pull port, back starboard,&rdquo;
but although I got her head up to the sea, before I could get way on
her, the sea broke, right square into the boat; filled us up, and drove
us right down to the bottom under the weight of tons of water. I felt
the heel of the boat actually hit the sand, and, marvellous to relate,
we all came to the surface with the boat, and sitting in our
places.</p>

<p>Even then, I believe I could have got through, if I had had a white
crew, or if these negro boat boys, although born and brought up to the
surf, had not lost their heads. They looked round, and, seeing the next
big curler just preparing to break, they cowered over their oars in
funk, instead of pulling to meet it as it rushed at us. This time, the
boat was rolled over and over, and I went to the bottom with the
infernal lead line would round my feet.</p>

<p>I had not noticed that I had been sitting with my feet in the middle
of the coil.</p>

<p>After disentangling this mess under water, I came up to find the
boat bottom up, and a man&rsquo;s hands flapping helplessly above the
water, close by. That was the Quartermaster, and he was drowning. There
was no time for any recognized life saving methods, I grabbed him by
the back of the wrist, gave him a sharp jerk towards the keel of the
boat and put his hand on the keel before he had time to grab me.
Instinctively, he pulled himself up on to the boat, only to be washed
off a moment later by the next sea. I got him up <i>again</i>, but it
was no use, there was nothing in the smooth planking of the boat for
him to hang on to. By the third time, I was getting done up myself, so
I took some of the gratings and oars that were floating about, and
shoved them under his arms. That was the last we ever saw of him.</p>

<p>To make matters worse for myself, I was wearing a very thin blue
serge uniform; although anything but white ducks is almost unheard of
as wearing apparel in this climate, yet for some unknown reason that
morning I had donned this wretched thing.</p>

<p>When I made up my mind to swim for the shore I discarded the coat
and released a spring belt I was wearing to rid myself of my pants, but
only added to my difficulties through my pants jamming round my
ankles.</p>

<p>With a thundering crash would come the sea and down I would go,
literally rolling over and over in the sand on the bottom, coming up
with my lungs bursting. Barely on the surface with hardly time to catch
a breath, then down again.</p>

<p>This was drowning</p>

<p>One hears about the panorama of one&rsquo;s past life passing in
sort of a mental review during those memorable moments.</p>

<p>Nothing of the kind. I was worried because I had always told my chum
sister that I would <i>never</i> be drowned.</p>

<p>She fussed a lot over me at times, so I used to say to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you bother, the sea is not wet enough to drown
me. I&rsquo;ll never be drowned,&rdquo; and that was on my mind and
making me feel really mad. I kept saying to myself, &ldquo;Here am I,
after what I&rsquo;ve said, being drowned after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pounding I was getting must have knocked me stupid, or I would
never have let it go on. I came to the surface on one such occasion, to
see a sea already bearing down on me, just curling over and falling and
here was I sort of crouching away, hating the damn thing; when it
suddenly dawned on me, &ldquo;swim into it, you fool.&rdquo; This, of
course, is the only way to get the better of a surf; get on its back;
whatever you do don&rsquo;t get under. A couple of strokes, and I drove
right straight into the hollow under the crest that was already
falling. Almost immediately I was whipped up on the back of the breaker
and carried at race-horse speed for the shore. In riding a surf, all
one need do is to keep in a certain position on its back; the knowledge
of this particular spot can only be gained through surf riding
experience&mdash;which fortunately I had had at odd times in different
parts of the world.</p>

<p>I was swept up on the beach, but it was far too steep to get a
foothold, and in consequence I was carried back with the next backwash
out into the surf again. Rolled over a few times, then up on the crest
of the next; a lightning sweep to the shore, crash on the beach, and
back once again with the undertow.</p>

<p>This had gone on just about long enough when I saw some negroes
running along the sore joining hands with the evident intention of
forming a human chain into the breakers, and I remembered no more. When
I regained consciousness, I was trying to disentangle my pants from my
feet, and drag the former up to respectability round my waist. As there
was no one to be seen, I got rid of some of the sea and headed for the
nearest habitation, which happened to be one of Swanzi&rsquo;s
Factories.</p>

<p>The negroes had gone to the French Authorities post haste, to inform
them of the defunct. They will not touch a dead white body and would
not have pulled me out only they had seen that I was still alive.</p>

<p>I was now supposed to be dead, and the French authorities came down
to view the corpse, but by this time the corpse was in the said
Swanzi&rsquo;s Factory absorbing whisky.</p>

<p>Three boys and a Quartermaster were drowned, and Bully Waters
learned the lesson of his life&mdash;and earned a dandy dressing down
when he got home.</p>

<p>Never again did he dare an officer, just to serve his own purpose,
and I gained the unsolicited honour of being the only white man to have
swum through the surf at Grand Bassam.</p>

<p>I might say the Chief&rsquo;s difficulties were by no means
imaginary. Under such conditions, even a trained crew could hardly have
made the beach, and certainly not without the help of a surf man on
shore. For one thing, the psychological moment for running on the back
of the breaker can never be detected from the sea. There is a man on
shore who has probably done nothing else all his life but signal the
surf boats when to &ldquo;run.&rdquo; He has a long bamboo staff in his
hand, on the end of which is a flag which he keeps at the
&ldquo;dip&rdquo; until he sees the opportunity. Meantime the surf
boat, with or without a cargo, has approached the edge of the breakers,
and there it stays, alternately shooting in the air and dropping into
the trough.</p>

<p>Four surf boys aside, each with his paddle poised ready for the
signal. The big toe of his right or left foot, according to which side
he is on tucked into a rope becket, The coxswain holds her stern steady
onto the seas, as they come rolling along; with the boys quietly back
paddling to keep her in position.</p>

<p>This may go on for ten, twenty minutes, or even half an hour, until
at last the man on shore sees the chance. Up goes his staff and he
races backwards and forwards along the beach waving his flag, for it
must be remembered that the boat may be anything up to half a mile off
shore. Instantly they see the flag, placing complete reliance in this
man&rsquo;s judgment, they dig in their paddles and drive like fury for
the beach, shouting with all their native excitement at the top of
their voices. If the man ashore has judged aright, and he rarely makes
a mistake, the boat is picked up on the back of a huge comber and
rushed for the beach at simply race-horse speed. They must just keep on
the forward edge of the crest, but not too far ahead or the stern will
kick up, the nose go down, and the boat will be flung end over end. Not
too far back, or the drag will get them, and holding them back at the
mercy of the next breaker to come crashing down into the boat when the
chances are that no one will get ashore.</p>

<p>There are many days after a westerly gale that it is impossible to
get any boat whatever to and from the beach. This had unluckily
happened to be one of them. All the way home. Bully Waters was a
sadder, wiser, and quieter man. It was peace, perfect peace.
Nevertheless, I, for one, had had enough of Bully Waters.</p>

<p>Another thing that helped me make my decision was the fact that on
the passage home I had a whole-time does of malaria. This in itself was
not so bad, but unfortunately we had a doctor&mdash;thorough good
scout&mdash;who said he believed in allowing patients any amount of
latitude to follow their own inclinations. Whether it was because I
made a particularly bad patient, I don&rsquo;t know, but the fact
remains that he allowed me to have iced drinks, lie in my pyjamas, and
have my boy fan me; take cold baths&mdash;in fact, do everything I
ought not to have done. The ultimate result of this was my temperature
soared to 106.2&deg;. Down the coast, 105&deg; is usually fatal, and on
this day in particular, one of the crew passed out at 105&deg;.</p>

<p>I was lying under a punkah, and some of the chaps kept coming down;
in fact nearly all the officers, on one pretest or another, came along
to say a few words, and sort of give me a pat on the shoulder and say,
&ldquo;Cheerio old boy.&rdquo; I little thought it was the long cheerio
they were wishing me, as, in their opinion, I could not last the night.
However, later on, that same night, to their surprise, I showed a
slight improvement, and, and some of them put their heads together and
decided to take the law in their own hands and see if they could not
induce a sweat. Forthwith three or four of them, armed themselves with
hot bottles and hot blankets, in which they rolled me like a mummy,
using sheer brute force, with the result that they broke the fever on
the spot, and I eventually recovered. But it had given me the shaking
up that was necessary to make up my mind to give up the West Coast with
all its attractions&mdash;and they are many.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h3>

<h4>TRAIL OF &lsquo;98</h4>

<p>What put the Canadian North-West into my head was the fact, that on
a previous voyage homeward bound, amongst the passengers we had two
splendid fellows named Matchett and Green, who had been prospecting up
the interior, from the West Coast of Africa. We became great friends,
and first of all they tried to persuade me to chuck the sea, and go out
again to Africa with them, which I would have done, except for the
rotten malaria and blackwater fevers. &ldquo;Well, then, would I go out
gold prospecting with them to Australia?&rsquo; This did not appeal to
me either, as there&rsquo;s no room for any but experts. Placer mining
was finished in Australia and anyway I knew nothing about either placer
or quartz.</p>

<p>Ultimately we compromised by deciding to go treasure hunting on St.
Paul&rsquo;s&mdash;that had a tremendous pull, but although we actually
got to the very point of buying a little brig, which we were to turn
into a schooner, the scheme, to the sorrow of us all, fell through.</p>

<p>Finally, we agreed to meet the next spring twelvemonth, in Vancouver
B.C., and push up into what was then the Great Unknown, and we left it
at that.</p>

<p>Up to this time Klondyke had not been heard of, but both Green and
Matchett, with the true miner&rsquo;s instinct, were determined that
the British North-West was the coming country for the gold
prospector.</p>

<p>At home one day, some weeks after leaving the <i>Niagara</i>, Bully
Waters and malaria, I happened on an advertisement of cheap fares to
Vancouver. Here, I thought was the very chance, to get out there twelve
months ahead of Dick and Matchett, and learn a bit about gold
prospecting. Furthermore I should then be able to pull my weight with
the others. Five minutes earlier I had no idea of going , but just on
the impulse of the moment, I said to myself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Putting the paper down, I strolled out of the room and with a touch
of the dramatic, informed my people that I was going out to the
Klondyke. (The rush by this time had started)</p>

<p>Opinions were somewhat varied, but only to the extent of what
particular degree of fool I was! However I was sufficiently pig-headed
and self confident to ignore the opinions of people, who certainly knew
what was good for me far better than I knew myself&mdash;at least, so
it has sometimes appeared in the light of later days. But on the whole
I have never regretted the decision that took me out to the Canadian
North-West, nor one single experience with which the days were filled.
I certainly did not make a fortune; in fact, not only made nothing but
lost all I had. But I had a grand time.</p>

<p>The idea had been to go out and work on the Cariboo Mines, learning
what gold was, in order that I might meet Matchett and Green the
following spring, and be able to do my bit along with the experts. Man
proposes, but the facts of that hard bitten country disposed and bust
up all my well laid plans.</p>

<p>In the first place, work on the Cariboo Mines was shut out with
Chinamen. This upset my calculations from the start, and, as often
happens, the king pin removed, all the rest went wrong. So we had to
look for some other hunting ground.</p>

<p>As one got deeper and deeper into the country one learnt that the
reports which had been blazoned forth in England, had that element of
truth which made them worse than a pack of lies. The object was to get
men into the country. They got them in their thousands, and hundreds of
thousands, and there they were, left stranded, to settle or find their
way out as best they could.</p>

<p>With a kindred spirit (also of the sea), with whom I had made
friends on the way out to Canada, we made up our minds to stay east of
the mountains and work north to the Slave Lakes. But we were to
discover that the bubble of this district had also been burst. One
place after another we heard of &ldquo;finds,&rdquo; only to learn
later that they were purely a figment of the imagination, a mirage,
that promptly faded on closer approach. We were not going to be beaten
on that account however, and since all places we heard of as likely
from a prospector&rsquo;s point of view became no good, and not worth
while, we decided to make for rail head which at that time was
Edmonton, and to strike a trail of our own, west-north-west, for the
mountains, and then north.</p>

<p>All we lacked was someone with some sense and some knowledge of the
North-West. We were to find that out later when experience should have
at last overcome our abyssmal (sic) ignorance of the
&ldquo;Trail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gold we found in plenty, but never in paying quantities. It is all
float gold east of the mountains, and this we learned through bitter
experience.</p>

<p>The generally accepted theory is that the range of the Rocky
Mountains rose, throwing the sea back on either side. On the west, into
its native ocean, but on the east it was trapped by the land, and
results in endless muskegs, swamps and lakes, which infest that part of
Canada. We lived in a state of moisture and the only wonder is that we
didn&rsquo;t grow webs to our toes.</p>

<p>Time and again we thought we had struck rich, only to find, on
applying the test, that it was worthless. Right down on the banks of
the Saskatchewan, in Edmonton, a man could &ldquo;wash&rdquo; a dollar
and a half a day. The further north, and the richer it gets, but the
more the cost of transport. Up on the MacCleod, Athabaska, and Smoky
River it pans out at times, almost all a man&rsquo;s heart could
desire, but owing to the configuration of the country, it invariably
peters out, and pay dirt in any reasonable quantity is never
forthcoming.</p>

<p>We, of course, were just tenderfeet, my chum and myself and two
others, but as Matchett and Green used to tell me, &ldquo;having been a
sailor the trail will never worry you&rdquo; and they were right. We
remained in camp in Edmonton with a temperature anything down to
40&deg; below Zero, or 72&deg; below freezing point, whilst we gathered
together an outfit of stores and horses. Many a chuckle I had over the
thought &ldquo;if only some of my shipmates saw me now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon we had things licked into shape&mdash;or what we considered
shape, and launched ourselves out into that wild Nor&rsquo;-West mid
winter, rivers still frozen and bearing. We struck away with lots of
confidence and little sense over muskegs and jamb piles; no tenderfeet
us! we would cut our own way. The only wonder is that we did not break
our horses&rsquo; legs, and our own necks before we had gone a score of
miles. Horses up to their bellies in snow, stumbling over fallen trees,
making a bare mile an hour. This went on for three days until by sheer
accident, we stumbled on a perfectly good road, which had been running
parallel with us, all the way to Prince Albert, and along which we
might have comfortably journeyed had we not been so pig-headed in our
determination to make our own trail and not admit our ignorance.</p>

<p>The party, as I have said, consisted of four, my chum and myself,
and two fellows from the Black Hills. My chum was also a sailor, and by
this time we had come to the conclusion that as far as wood-craft in
the Canadian North-West went, our feet were very tender indeed. Not so
the two other chaps, who, like so many others from the great U.S.A.,
were never willing to admit their limitations; in fact, a frequent
expression of these two otherwide splendid fellows was
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re from the Black Hills; we ain&rsquo;t no dog gone
tenderfeet.&rdquo; That might have been quite true, but it is a solid
fact, which were very soon to find out, that their experience did not
run on all fours with their self-confidence; in fact, it was amusing at
times to see how quickly their views changed, and with child-like
simplicity they would say &ldquo;what in hell do we do now?&rdquo; If
it is a river, they were perfectly frank that they had not the first
idea how to get across, but even in the depths of our first three
days&rsquo; trek, when we became tied up between two chains of lakes,
it was really comical at times to see how jumpy these two would be
&ldquo;old timers&rdquo; from the Black Hills, became.</p>

<p>On one occasion we were startled by a steady thump or beat; with the
closest resemblance imaginable to a pit-head pump, a sort of steady
thud, thud, thud, and then a pause, like the usual gas engine. Our
Black Hills companions were the first to give voice to the general
uneasiness by an abrupt enquiry, &ldquo;Say, bo, what in hell&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I had heard it for some time and was turning
over in my mind the possibility of a pit engine or quartz stamp with
the limits of hearing. At the same time one had to take into
consideration the way in which sound carries in the vast trackless
regions of the North-West.</p>

<p>One speaks, rather loosely, of &ldquo;perfect silence.&rdquo; The
Canadian Nor&rsquo;-West, in winter, is one of the few places where one
can experience it; where the snap of a bough, bursting through frost, a
common enough occurrence in a temperature 40 degrees below, echoes like
a pistol shot, and carries for three or four miles. It is easy to be
deceived both as regards sound and sight, where the silence is so
absolute and visibility so perfect.</p>

<p>Days went on, and at odd times we could hear this mysterious
thudding. One day, after it had been particularly noticeable, our Black
Hills pals suggested a night watch, in view of the possibility of
Indians. (I firmly believe they thought it was Indians signaling.) My
chum and I were quite in agreement with them as to the possibility, in
view of the number of tepee poles, and evidence of wigwams we came
across. At the same time, Bill and I were quite resigned to the fact
that we were tenderfeet and would, therefore, stand little chance of
anticipating the approach of Indians, whether asleep or awake. All the
questionable joys of standing a night watch, after a day&rsquo;s work,
were only too familiar to both of us, and frankly, we preferred to take
the chance and have the blankets. On this point at least, Bill was
luridly emphatic, so that ended all talk of keeping watch. Our Black
Hills boys were none too pleased, but since Bill told them they could
keep the first two watches, and give us a call if they liked, and then
turn in. &ldquo;Yes, but are you going to turn out?&rdquo; they asked.
Bill replied, in the most convincing language that we were not.</p>

<p>The thudding was still going on at intervals, and we were certainly
very mystified by it; until one day, whilst leading the trail, I
suddenly heard the sound quite close on my left. Throwing an arm up for
the whole pack train to stop, I dropped the lariat to the ground, which
would stop the leader in his tracks, then throwing my rifle from my
shoulder, where one carries it at all times by the sling, I dropped on
my stomach, and commenced to worm my way towards the sound. When the
sound stopped I stopped; when it went on I went on, until after
scuffling along for twenty or thirty yards, I poked my head into an
open glade and peered around. There I stayed for some little time,
every now and then hearing the drumming. Then suddenly I saw the cause
of all our uneasiness. Sitting on a fallen tree was an old cock
partridge drumming with his wings, calling to his mate! We put the
cause of all our anxious hours into the pot, and cooked him for the
next meal.</p>

<p>That sound must at times have carried for miles with absolute
distinctness. After that, any circumstances we could not explain was
always classified as &ldquo;another partridge,&rdquo; for the benefit
of our U.S.A. boys. They certainly never suggested another night
watch.</p>

<p>The natural difficulties of the country come under the headings of
muskegs, jamb-piles and rivers. The former are just swamps without
bottom. You have your pack train plodding steadily along, the ground
commences to get moist, then damp, then wet, and finally soft. The
horses, commence to pick their way from tuft to tuft, at last one
slips, and down he goes, right up to the belly in pure swamp. This
means timber has to be cut, and laid alongside of him, whilst a couple
of chaps sit astride the logs, unload the 250 lb. pack from the saddle
and pass it back piecemeal to the dry land. Having done this, one fore
leg is pulled out of the mire and rested on a log, then the other fore
leg ditto. Next his tail is seized, and then, with a terrific yell, and
altogether, with a sucking squelch, he comes out. (That is, if the
horse does his part, otherwise you try again.) This operation a dozen
times a day, wet through and covered with mud, is included in the joys
of gold prospecting in the north-west.</p>

<p>Then rivers. Such rivers! When they do break in Spring, it&rsquo;s a
sight to be remembered. Crossing them is easy enough up to this point,
but after they break, then apart from the cold, one has to contend with
literal icebergs tearing down out of the mountains with a torrent of
melted snow, grinding and crashing together with thousands of tons of
pressure behind them. Of course, you&rsquo;ve got to realise that after
the rivers break the crossing in the first instance had to be made with
a horse, and by sheer good hard swimming. At the same time a line must
be taken, and the drag from it always feels like a ton weight in the
water; with a river only just broken this is of course quite
impossible.</p>

<p>First you must travel up stream, until a suitable spot is found for
taking off, and, what is more important still, a suitable spot is
located lower down on the opposite, when a landing can be made. If you
don&rsquo;t make your landing, it&rsquo;s a thousand to one you cannot
get back again.</p>

<p>A rope long enough to reach at least twice across is coiled down
clear on the bank, and on no account must that rope be checked as it
runs out, otherwise you immediately check the swimmer. The first river
we came to was the Pembinaw, and I had made three shots before I found
the bright Alecs on the bank (again our Western States men) thought the
rope was running out too quickly and in consequence were checking it
under their feet!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact there were rapids just below us and unless I was
well over in the first hundred yards I had perforce to let go the end
of the rope altogether and get back as quickly as possible in order to
avoid being swept into the rapids. Eventually, I found out where the
trouble lay and on the fourth attempt succeeded.</p>

<p>In water of this temperature a suit of underclothes and a belt does
not offer much protection. I really don&rsquo;t know why one always
wears a suit of underclothes; it must be that the thick wool helps when
one comes out of the water; however it seems the usual practice up
there to wear a suit of wool underclothes.</p>

<p>Having once got the line across all is plain sailing. A few
well-seasoned logs are pinned together with green willow pegs to make a
raft, which is towed back and forth.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h3>

<h4>CROSSING THE ATHABASKA</h4>

<p>One river we struck as we got up to the mountains seemed the father
of all rivers, the Athabaska, broken up into rapids and nearly three
miles across. We arrived on the banks one evening, and set out to get
over as it is always better to have dry clothes and the river behind
you in the morning. We forded a considerable distance and arrived on an
island in the middle, where, in the end, we had to camp for the night.
Next morning we set out to find a ford. There wasn&rsquo;t one, and,
what was of added interest, we found that the river was rising.</p>

<p>A couple of days before, we had chummed up with another party of
three heading the same way, so we joined forces in the hope that many
heads might help. I can&rsquo;t say they they did, but fortunately for
all of us, the assurances we had received from old timers that sailors
take naturally to the trail, proved quite true and of inestimable
value, though parked in the middle of the Athabaska, with a rising
river in front and behind us, it did not seem as if all our sailoring
experience was going to help much; and it didn&rsquo;t, despite seven
attempts to find a ford. There seemed nothing for it but to take the
bull by the horns, get on a horse, get into the water, and hope for the
best.</p>

<p>The opposite bank, another island, was only a matter of a hundred
yards, but the sides were sheer with the exception of two places where
the banks had broken away. There seemed practically no hope of fetching
the break higher up the river, but the lower one was just possible. So
I determined, that night, that unless the river went down I was going
to have a shot at it, particularly as there was every unpleasant
indication that the river frequently submerged the whole island. Bill
would go anywhere where anyone else would lead. He certainly had no
fear, and he was the only one of the party who would face water. His
horse was none too good though, just a bundle of nerves; whereas mine,
that I had chosen out of a corral of fifty or sixty, could and would do
anything but talk. This was to be the one and only occasion on which I
ever saw him baulk at water, and that night, when I tried to get him to
face this flood&mdash;which was nothing but white water, coming tearing
and foaming down out of the mountains&mdash;he certainly didn&rsquo;t
like it. In fact it is no exaggeration to say he just hated it. Bill
<i>would</i> come, but unfortunately he had never ridden a horse in his
life, much less swam one. I cautioned him, &ldquo;Now mind, as soon as
he loses his feet, get off his back and hang on to his withers,&rdquo;
and in we went, Rufus step by step, and every step a snort. He
certainly did not like it a bit, and, speaking generally, a man is a
fool to force one of these intelligent pack horses when he baulks. But
this was an exception. So with a pat and an urge, he went on, step by
step, with the water foaming between his legs, till at last he lost his
feet, got a dose of funk, and tried to fling back. Fortunately, his
head came round my way, and I was able to give him a hearty smack on
the nose, and head him off again in the right direction. Then he
stretched himself out and went through the water like a harbour
launch.</p>

<p>Having settled him on his course, I looked round for Bill who had
followed me in. All that was visible at the moment were the four legs
of a horse, sticking up above the water, and just in the act of rolling
over. Bill must have lost his head, and tried to stick on his
horse&rsquo;s back, both of them rolling over in consequence.</p>

<p>Amazing though it seemed, I struck the higher break in the opposite
bank, an accomplishment I had though utterly impossible. I&rsquo;ll say
that horse could swim! The moment old Rufus touched the ground with his
feet he tore out of the water like one possessed, snorting like a
grampus, thoroughly wound up, and shaking like a leaf with excitement.
Throwing a leg over him as he came out, I kept him going and galloped
down to the lower end of the island as hard as we could, coiling the
lariat up in my hands at the same time. Bill had one chance as he swept
by, and one only. If he missed the end of that lariat, he was bound
down to where the river humped itself up in a canyon, a few miles
below, in which no canoe, let alone a man, could live for a minute.</p>

<p>Arriving at the lower end of the island, I drove Rufus down the spit
until he was as deep in the water as I dared go and still retain good
foothold, and then waited until Bill came past. It was a critical
moment, for I knew I should only get that one throw, and that to pretty
well the full extent of the rope. I must land the end of the lariat
somewhere near him, where he could either swim to it&mdash;in which
case he would lose his horse&mdash;or, if I was fortunate enough, get
so near that he could secure the end, and still hang onto the
horse&rsquo;s halter.</p>

<p>Actually, what happened, I made my throw, and with unlimited luck,
landed the end right alongside of him. I yelled to him to hang on to
his horse, while he took a quick seamanlike turn round his wrist, and
with the other hand gripped the halter. My end was round my waist,
slacking and easing away to the strain whilst Bill and his horse, swung
round into the eddy where we were standing, and got their feet on firm
ground again.</p>

<p>No one ever had a closer call, though Bill didn&rsquo;t seem to
worry.</p>

<p>We spent that night turning ourselves round, like a roast of beef on
a spit, trying to warm one side and then the other, lying in nothing
but our underclothes, in front of a roaring fire we had built up out of
driftwood.</p>

<p>The whole of the next day we were alternately fording, swimming, and
freezing, whilst we made our way to the mainland, were we eventually
located an Indian canoe. This we brought down to where the others were
marooned, and eventually succeeded in ferrying the rest of the party
over. The river was by then within a few inches of the surface of the
island and they had made all preparations for taking to the trees. That
would have been all right, but, unfortunately horses can&rsquo;t
climb.</p>

<p><br>
 It is undoubtedly a great game crossing rapids in a canoe. You tow up
stream so far, until you find an eddy or little bay, causing a bit of
slack water. Probably just a cut of a few feet into the bank will do.
Then a bit lower down on the opposite side, another convenient eddy
must be found. Then load the canoe, and don&rsquo;t forget to put the
paddle on top of everything, ready to hand. Give her a push, leap in,
and land in the bottom on your knees, sitting on your feet&mdash;if you
are lucky. It needs a bit of practice, but fortunately I had had plenty
of opportunity for that in the dug-outs of Rio de Janeiro, in which you
surely do have to part your hair in the middle. I had won many a race
in Rio, and compared with a Dug-out, the Canadian birchbark is easy.
Having landed in the bottom of the canoe you seize your paddle, and dig
like fury. The water fairly curls up at the bow, and you simply tear
across the river at the rate of knots. Head her straight for the
opposite eddy as if you were going to ram the bank at full speed.
Actually what happens is when the stem touches dead water, and the
river sweeping down, swings the stern round, bringing the canoe to a
standstill, riding motionless alongside the bank all in one movement.
It is thrilling all right&mdash;particularly with rapids just below
you&mdash;but tiring when you have to keep it up all day, as we had to,
to get clear of the island before it disappeared.</p>

<p>All throughout this long trek, swimming rivers, getting through
jamb-piles, over muskegs; hail, rain, blow and snow, my old banjo
survived. It had, as a matter of fact been a good companion and helped
cheer us up and pass many a weary hour, right from the start of the
voyage on board ship, and also on the slow going train bound west and
even, at times, on the trail.</p>

<p>Bill was a particularly good step dancer and singer, which had, as a
rule packed our car on the way across country. Many and evening we
passed away singing old popular songs. On the trail the banjo was
brought out when we were not too dog tired, after a terrific
day&rsquo;s struggle&mdash;times when it needed all one&rsquo;s powers
of self-control to prevent quarreling with anybody, or everybody who
came near. There was the amusing side too, such as up in the mountains,
when Indians squatted on their haunches all round us. They rarely
speak, nor do they ask for food, but it is always the custom to pass
them a dish of beans, which, of course, is the staple diet. After we
had finished our meal, and put on our pipes, the smoke of the fires
slowly blowing across, sometimes, partly for a lark, we would start up
the banjo, and Bill his song and dance. It was worth while just to see
the looks on those Indians&rsquo; faces. Their features always seem
carved out of stone, and it is considered the worst form for them to
register any surprise, but to hear the sound coming out of that banjo
usually beat them, and immediately it was put down, they would gather
round and peer into it, to see where the sound came from.</p>

<p>How that old banjo survived beats me. It always seemed to come up
smiling even after swimming a river or working through a forest.</p>

<p>One follows the old buffalo trails which almost invariably lead to a
ford, also wherever buffalo could go between the trees, so also could a
pack horse pass between them. I have, on more than one occasion, seen
the banjo athwart two trees, and old Rufus gently putting pressure on
it, wondering, I expect, what sort of a fool I was to make up his pack
so badly that he couldn&rsquo;t get through. As a matter of fact, the
banjo was always just lightly placed on top of the pack, and was apt to
swing across. However, nothing was ever broken, all credit to the old
boy.</p>

<p>For day and days we would be plodding on through forests, hardly
ever seeing the sun. Then, just like walking out of a door, you walk
out from amongst the trees, with nothing but the prairie in front of
you, without even a shrub in sight; nothing but limitless snow.</p>

<p>On one occasion, after being several days in the open, we arrived at
the edge of one of these forests, and camped for our midday meal before
diving in. It was obvious to even the most inexperienced that something
very special in the way of storms was brewing. A heavy bank was coming
up as black as night, but full of beans (literally and metaphorically)
we would be hard cases and allow nothing in the way of weather to stop
us. We still had to learn that, above all, discretion is the watchword
in that hard country. So, having finished our meal, we once again hit
the trail. It was not long before snow, in the powdery, dusty form
which it always takes in the interior of Canada, was sweeping through
the trees, growing thicker and thicker every minute. It never snows in
flakes; always this fine dust, which on the open prairie will suffocate
a man in a few minutes. We stuck to the trail for a couple of hours
until it completely disappeared. We realised we had lost the trail when
one of the horses went over the edge of the cliff and rolled to the
bottom. By the time we got him and his pack up again we decided we had
had enough, and finding a suitable spot, went into camp. The first
thing was to get a fire going, and in this country one always carries a
bit of birch bark. This will burn and burn brightly under almost any
conditions; very nearly under water. With this, and a few pine
branches, it is always possible to start a good blaze, and if one can
get hold of willow then you can have all the heat you want, and no
smoke. We were glad to get any fire whatever, so just dropped jackpines
across it, and as it burned up, so cut down bigger and bigger trees,
until we had one gigantic bonfire going, throwing out a tremendous and
mighty welcome warmth for some dozen or two yards all round. It was the
only way to hope to hold off the snow and get any degree of
comfort.</p>

<p>A weird sight, in the middle of this Canadian forest. Sitting around
a gigantic fire, the horses&rsquo; tails to wind, nothing but an
impenetrable canopy of snow all round, but so great was the heat from
the fire, and so fine the snow, that it actually melted and evaporated
before it could touch the ground. The upper part of the trees, in fact
trees twenty yards from us were out of sight in the snow, and yet where
we were, within the snow walls, was warm and dry. Soon we had the billy
going, and a pan full of pork and beans on a fire. Wet clothes and wet
blankets, which had been under the pack saddles, hanging up to dry.
Even the crashing of an occasional tree could not keep us awake. We
slept and dreamt of the gold we were surely going to find some time
soon.</p>

<p>A few days later we did actually make our strike. It came about when
we had been choosing our camp for the night. In this choice there are
two essential factors, food and water for the horses. It may be a
swamp&mdash;it frequently was; and in that case you can cut yourself
some perfectly good boughs of jackpines and make out as comfortably as
you can; but grass there must be. On this occasion, where we were
prospecting was on a creek, and next morning while some of the party
went off with their rifles, others, of whom I was one, went down to the
creek with gold pan and shovel to &ldquo;wash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This washing out, on bars and banks, had just about become a rite by
this time. As a matter of course one shouldered gold pan and shovel,
and trudged off whenever a river showed up. To a certain extent, it had
become perfunctory, although there was always the suspense and the
latent thrill as to whether &ldquo;colours&rdquo; <i>would</i> show up.
You take a shovel of pay dirt, throw it into a pan of water, and
commence by giving it a heaving circular motion, which sends the water
swirling round, stirring up all solid matter in the pan. The lighter
earth, smaller shingle and gravel quickly flow over the edge as dip
after dip of water is taken, until, finally, there is nothing left but
black sand, and in this resides the float gold, which is separated and
collected by introducing about a teaspoonful of mercury to which the
gold adheres. Then, squeezing the mercury through chamois leather, you
have a little nugget of gold left behind&mdash;if you are lucky.</p>

<p>I forget whose pan it was that first got down to the black sand, but
there was a yell, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found.&rdquo; Everybody dropped
everything and dashed over to see what it was. Sure enough, there were
the colours shining bright and clear as the pan with the residue of
black sand and a little water, was given that final scientific twirl
which throws the black sand forward and leaves trailing out behind the
glittering specks of gold.</p>

<p>There is only the last test; viz., application of muriatic acid. If
it is gold, it only shines the brighter, but if it is false, maybe
mica, it will at once turn black, and disappear.</p>

<p>Our next call was for the acid, which could not be found. Evidently
it was stowed away in some chap&rsquo;s pack who, at that moment, was
off with his rifle trying to pick up a stew for the pot. Nowhere could
we discover the muriatic, but we had some acetic acid, and with this we
decided to give it a try-out, until we could make the proper test.</p>

<p>The effect was that the gold only gleamed the brighter, and we
jubilantly assured ourselves that we had &ldquo;found.&rdquo; At once,
everyone started planning out the camp, the sluice boxes, and all the
necessary paraphernalia connected with placer mining. More pay dirt was
washed out, and still more colours found&mdash;and wealth and affluence
were assuredly ours for the taking! All that remained was to gather up
the gold that was lying at our feet, and trek back to civilisation.</p>

<p>About this time the fellow with the gun, gameless as usual, arrived
back in camp. Of course the good news was told, and, quite as a matter
of form, merely to confirm what we were convinced was already a fact,
we suggested the muriatic test. He got the acid out of his pack, and
over we went to the gold pan; gave it a little swing, and on the
glittering contents poured the muriatic. Result, complete, absolute and
utter black out. It was mica. Down went all our hopes and with them our
spirits.</p>

<p>However, these disappointments soon wear off, and one is ready again
to strike the trail with that buoyant confidence that forever lies in
the prospector&rsquo;s heart. Good pay dirt, he is confident is only a
little further on.</p>

<p>To be well bitten with the gold bug is a glorious
sensation&mdash;always on the verge of the great discovery. The sun is
never up early enough, and sets too soon. There would be nothing to
beat it, if one only had plenty to eat. Even the scenery alone up in
these mountains, almost compensates for the hardships. Everything is
wonderful and seems so amazingly near. Even the snow caps of the
Rockies, towering thousands of feet above look as if one could leave
the sunshine and be tobogganing within an hour, so rarefied and
wonderfully clear is the atmosphere. Look up a draw (an opening between
mountains). &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
fetch that tomorrow night,&rdquo; but maybe it will be three days
before you reach it; a spot which seemed at most some ten or fifteen
miles away.</p>

<p>A grand country, but a hungry one. At that time, even the Indians
themselves were starving, and burning out the forests for game. These
mountain Indians are the only tribe left that are not treaty bound;
though, nevertheless, they have a wholesome respect for that
magnificent body of men, the Canadian Mounted.</p>

<p>Naturally one keeps one&rsquo;s eyes peeled, and one&rsquo;s rifle
close to hand night and day, but there was never an occasion, or even
the remotest approach to a necessity to use it. They are a friendly
lot&mdash;wonderful, both at hunting and on the trail. Their powers of
endurance are almost beyond belief, on foot and on horseback.
I&rsquo;ve known a trained Indian runner, to go for three days and
three nights without let or pause, and without food, other than what he
was carrying with him. I&rsquo;ll admit he was making his way with a
very urgent message; but for endurance they are mighty hard to beat.
Then keep up a glide or lope, doing a steady four miles an hour the
whole day through. The pack horses are trained to walk and never break
into a trot or canter, but the distances they can cover, with this
little short step, would be utterly beyond the power of the horses
commonly found in civilisation. Of course, this applies to the pack
horse, and should not be confused with the ordinary cayuse, which is
the boon companion of other Indian tribes such as Blackfeet, Crows, and
Sioux, who are not exactly the chaps to have with one on a pack train.
On the other hand <i>they</i> can perform marvels of horsemanship
also.</p>

<p>One evening in North Edmonton, there was an argument between a half
breed Blackfoot and some white men as to whether a certain tribe of
Blackfeet had or had not been wiped out by the Crows, on the banks of
the River Saskatchewan near by. There is a place close to the banks of
the Saskatchewan known as the Hudson Bay Flats, where an old Hudson Bay
Fort used to stand. A flat piece of land, extending over perhaps, fifty
or sixty acres. It was claimed, that in a fight between the two tribes,
the latter drove the former over the edge of the cliff, into the river
and drowned the lot of them. This half-breed Blackfoot maintained that
his tribe were neither drowned nor annihilated, but that they went down
the cliff on their horses and swam the river. Almost everybody smiled
at his claim, for although the cliff consisted of earth, yet it was so
utterly sheer, that it seemed impossible for a man to get down, with
any degree of safety, let alone a man and a horse. Furthermore, taking
into consideration that the Blackfeet rode at it, full tilt, with the
Crows in pursuit, one could imagine nothing but sheer annihilation.</p>

<p>To me the smile certainly seemed justified.</p>

<p>Then this half-breed got shirty and said he would ride at that cliff
himself for a bottle of whisky, and he was not long in finding a man
who would put up the bottle, if he would do it. The next day we all
turned up on the flats, and this chap mounted his cayuse, bare back, a
good quarter of a mile away from the edge of the cliff, and without
pause or hesitation rode straight at it, over the edge, and down the
odd hundred feet and into the river. All I can say is, he simply went
over and down into the river, and swam back. How he managed it, or why
both horse and man didn&rsquo;t go head over heels, is simply beyond
me, but the fact remains that he never left his horse&rsquo;s back,
although he laid full length along it, with his head resting on its
rump. I have certainly never seen, and could never have imagined such
an amazing feat&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll say he won that whisky.</p>

<p>These fellows are now all Treaty Indians, but whether with either
the Crows or the Sioux, there is now very little to fear. The Canadian
Mounted Police have brought it home to these tribes (likewise renegade
whites) that there is going to be law and order, and they know, for a
stonewall certainty, that any break away from this, and somebody will
pay the penalty.</p>

<p>The same applies to the white man. There&rsquo;s none of the wild
and woolly west business in Canada. It a man drew a gun he&rsquo;d
probably get his stern kicked, good and hard.</p>

<p>In the past it was the custom for one of the Canadian Mounted to be
detailed off to track down and arrest any man who had committed a
crime, whether small or great, and the powers of endurance exhibited by
the tracker were never less than those of the man he was tracking down.
Day after day, and week after week, he would follow his man, and
eventually track him down. Of course, if the crime had been such as
murder, the man had to be brought back alive, or with very clear
evidence of his death. There was a recognised procedure in the latter
instance which gives evidence enough when dealing with Indians, the
details of which there is no need to go into too closely. In any case
there are lots of really good writers who have written up the Canadian
Mounted&mdash;though the romance has been somewhat dimmed since they
mounted them on motor-bikes.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h3>

<h4>NO GAME . . . NO GOLD</h4>

<p>We had hit the trail out of Edmonton with little or no meat, and
what we had was mainly bacon. We lived in the full expectation of
finding lashings of game through the country. The sum total of all we
saw, was a moose, a bear, and a porcupine. The moose my chum got, the
bear we didn&rsquo;t get, the porky I got. How Bill got the moose was
proof again that his guardian angel was forever alert. The moose is an
ugly customer to wound, and has some very nasty habits of kneading a
man to death, when sufficiently annoyed. A 44-56 bullet in the stomach,
certainly provides an inducement for all the trouble one may be looking
for. Bill was a rotten shot at the best of times. I saw this big bull
moose&mdash;evidently disturbed by some of our would-be hunters, come
flashing through the trees, and at the same instant Bill also saw it,
and raised his rifle. I thought, &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re for it,&rdquo;
but it was too late to shout at him. He let drive. In my heart of
hearts, I half hoped he had missed it altogether, but, to my utter
amazement, the beast dropped in his tracks&mdash;stone dead&mdash;shot
through the heart. And I have seen Bill miss a target as big as a
haystack!</p>

<p>The bear was my misfortune. Following the trail along the hillside
we had come across a jamb pile. This was a whole forest of trees on the
side of a hill, fallen down flat years and years ago, and now become
thoroughly seasoned timber. Once we had to cut through a jamb pile
owing to one of the horses having driven a willow stake through its
chest, and in consequence being unable to lift its near foreleg, but
one never attempts to cut through timber of this description, from
choice. Although the hill resembled the roof of a house, it was going
to be better to make the climb up, rather than try and cut our way
through.</p>

<p>Old Rufus was easily the best pack horse, and, almost invariably,
led the trail, as he was doing at this time. All the same, it seemed
almost impossible for a horse to climb up that hill light, let alone
with 250 lb. on his back. Whilst we were discussing the best plan,
Rufus settled the matter by suddenly starting off up on his own, just
as if he wanted to show what he could do when he wanted. I had no
choice but to follow him, as I held his lariat in my hands, which if I
had dropped it would have been bound to foul his feet. He went up that
fifty or sixty feet like a lamplighter, and arrived on a little
plateau, with me puffing and blowing at his side.</p>

<p>This little effort had been carried out in silence, and I suppose
Mr. Bruin&rsquo;s first intimation of anyone in the vicintity, was our
arriving just outside his front door. Probably it was sheer curiosity
that made him stick his head out within six feet of Rufus&rsquo; nose
on the off side. I, being on the near side, could, of course, see
nothing. The old chap made up his mind to go down again even more
quickly than he had decided to come up. He just let out a squeal of
indignant surprise, and swung round, smiting me a mighty crack on the
side of the head with his nose, which laid me sprawling, whilst he sat
on his hams, and slid down that hill, 250 lb. and all, with his tail
streaming out behind. A more ridiculous sight I have never seen, and,
despite the nearness of the bear, I had to roar with laughter. The hill
was so steep that his hind legs were almost between the forelegs, as he
tobogganed down the hillside. My rifle, which I had been carrying in
the sling as usual over my back, had been flung clear in the tumble,
and long before I could get hold of it, our one and only bear had
vanished.</p>

<p>The porcupine I met whilst trying to find a draw out of the
mountains.</p>

<p>All old timers warn tenderfeet &ldquo;not to lose heart in the
mountains.&rdquo; I suppose it is the amazing solitude, the immensity
of the spaces, and the seemingly utter futility of man that engenders
the spirit of funk, when buried in these appalling masses and
precipices of granite, known as the Rocky Mountains. I think there was
more than a little evidence of funk in our camp, in fact it had even
been suggested by someone that we should turn back. Not one of our
original party, I am glad to say, but the poisonous suggestion was
there, there could be no doubt. It was the mountains that had got
everyone, so the best plan as far as we could see, was to get out of
them. I was making my way along in glorious sunshine on a well fed
animal, happy with the world, and confident of finding a way out for
the party, then all would be well. At this juncture I saw an animal
fifty yards in front of me, crossing my trail. It looked like nothing
on earth; certainly nothing that I could recognise, never having seen a
porcupine like this in my life before. It was truly the father of all
porcupines; and looked as big as many a young donkey. Of course in the
tall grass he was anything but clearly defined. However, I judged as
best I could where the head of the beast should be, and where probably
his fore-shoulder would come, and let drive. He sank down out of sight
in the grass. I circled round, still on horseback, until I located him,
and pumped in a couple more 44-56&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>He was dead all right so I proceeded to skin him. Having completed
this task, the next thing was to get him clear up off the ground, and
out of reach of the coyotes. It was quite impossible to lift him, so I
had to slip the lariat on to a hind leg, lead it over the bough of a
tree, and hitch it on to the cinch of my horse. In this manner I
hoisted him up and made him fast. I then cut off a fore-quarter,
intending to cook it for a meal that night. I did, but I might as well
have tried to feast off a cut of rhino hide; there was just about as
much chance of getting my teeth in. I picked him up on my return and
took him back to camp, where we boiled him three times a day for seven
solid days before we could even get our teeth into him. I will admit
that through lack of solid food, out teeth had become somewhat loose,
but believe me, they hardened up before we had finished with our friend
the porcupine. We remained in camp for several days, undecided whether
to go ahead or go back. Meantime fierce arguments arose on the
advisability of pushing on. By far the majority were in favour of going
back.<br>
 It was undoubtedly a fact that we could only push on at a tremendous
risk, as our supply of food would shortly give out for a certainty, and
we should be compelled to depend on the country alone, which up to the
present had proved a very poor source of supply. The point settled
itself in the end, however, and it happened this way.</p>

<p>Bill and I would not saddle up to turn back, and the others could
not cross the rivers without our help, so it was a sort of stalemate.
Every day some of us went out prospecting to see what hopes there were
of getting colours or finding a draw out of the mountains. On one
occasion we came across a creek, though it would be termed a small
river in England. It looked as thought this river passed between two
fair sized ledges of a cliff a little further on, and then struck open
country. In this case we knew there must be a bar, and on this bar we
should find proof as to whether with this particular creek the water
flowed at any time through a gold bearing area, by the colours
obtained, also we might find a way out of the mountains.</p>

<p>We soon knocked a raft together, by cutting dry timber into lengths,
boring holes with a one and a half inch auger, and pegging with green
willow, the pegs going through one log and well into the next.
Immediately the wood takes the water, it swells, and binds the whole
far firmer than any rope could do, every bit as strong as if it were
lashed with good stout wire. Not only that, but owing to the resiliency
and bendability of the willow, a raft of this kind can go bumping over
rocks without any danger of coming to pieces. In fact, it becomes
literally impossible to separate the logs without either drying them
out, or cutting thought the willow pegs with a saw. We launched our
raft, and with gold pans and shovels a day&rsquo;s provisions&mdash;or
what we had in our straitened circumstances to allow ourselves for a
day&rsquo;s food&mdash;took to the river. We paddled out towards the
centre, and let the current do the rest, which it did in short order
and very effectively. She soon shot past the ledges we had seen, and
then, instead of the ravine opening out as we fondly expected, the
river took a sharp turn to the right (for which we had not bargained)
and literally dived down between two solid walls of rock.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to hang on, and wait for whatever was
going to happen. Everything was well secured to the raft, and this
proved fortunate, for as the river narrowed down, it humped up so that
quite reasonable sized breakers formed, curling up against the race of
the stream. We had just time to fling ourselves flat on the raft, and
hang on for dear life, while the thing plunged madly down the rapids.
We had to chance hitting a rock and being shot off. Fortunately, the
passage was short and sharp, but by no means sweet. Still one could not
help noticing the difference between being struck with these freshwater
breakers, and similar seas of salt water. You can knock a man down with
a bucket of salt water, but not so by any means with fresh water. Every
time we rushed at a breaker, each would yell to the other, &ldquo;Hang
on, Jack,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hang on, Bill,&rdquo; and we would crash
through the breaking water comparatively easily compared with meeting a
similar breaker at sea.</p>

<p>I suppose we were some five or ten minutes making the passage,
although it seemed more like as many hours. We came out with the raft
into open water and paddled with our shovels to the side, soaking wet
through, although that condition was more or less normal. Mackintoshes
and umbrellas are not exactly part of an outfit. When it rains you get
wet, and when the sun shines you get dry, and you are lucky if you are
dry when you go to bed. Yet such a thing as rheumatics or illness is
unknown.</p>

<p>Having landed, we automatically started on the usual procedure with
gold pan and shovel. Colours as usual--quite good colours, but not good
enough to justify packing food from Edmonton. As we couldn&rsquo;t get
back that night we prospected a bit further down on the opposite bank,
but with the same result. The raft would have to be abandoned,
likewise, everything else, except bare necessities, for the climb
back.</p>

<p>Peep of day next morning we were off, up and up, colder and colder,
as hour after hour of steady climbing took us up higher and higher and
at last into the show line. Then down the other side, with always the
sporting chance of making a slip and starting a non-stop slide to
eternity; or even meeting a grizzly. The result would be the same in
both cases! There are not many grizzlies left, any more than there are
buffaloes, but there are still quite a few, and a grizzly is about the
most cussed customer that one can run across, in all the
Nor&rsquo;-West. As a rule he&rsquo;ll attack on sight, and nothing
short of a 45-90 hs the slightest effect, and even then it has got to
be planted carefully, in exactly the right spot and followed up
quickly, or you are going out. Once a grizzly gets its paws on a man,
he has far less chance than with a lion, and that&rsquo;s little
enough, by all accounts. Admittedly they have not the speed of a lion,
but whereas a lion is not difficult as a rule to bring down, a grizzly
seems to have about ten times more vitality. We should have been a
sorry pair if we had met one, for all we had was our shovels. We
thought, when we launched our craft that we were only going a couple of
miles there and back on the river, so we had not even taken our usual
inseparable friend, the rifle.</p>

<p>When, at long last, we did get back to the camp, we found the pros
and cons of advance or retreat had been settled by the rest of the
chaps packing their traps and clearing out. They had left us, what at
any rate they considered was our share of the grub&mdash;a tent, our
horses, rifles, and blankets.</p>

<p>Well, we had each other to swear at, and that was something;
although, as a matter of fact, when we did hit the camp we were far too
hungry and played out to consider the merits of the other chaps&rsquo;,
shall we say, desertion, or even our own loneliness. That came later.
It was a fair taste of just what it must be like to be absolutely alone
in these mountains. One could well believe all the tales one heard
about chaps who, from one cause or another, have been left on their
own, going stark, staring mad. There is sound advice in that caution,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose heart in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The actual loneliness didn&rsquo;t worry us a great deal, our sea
training took care of that, but it was the fact of turning back.</p>

<p>To turn back spelt utter failures of the whole expedition. Going on,
no matter how slowly, was to break fresh ground, with always the
possibility of making a strike. If we did decide to go on then we must
make up our minds to kill one horse and smoke the meat; that would have
to be done and we were both just as enthusiastic on that programme as
we should have been over a suggestion to kill either of ourselves. Your
horse becomes your pal, and treats you as such, and he expects the same
treatment from you. He will nose round you on the trail, and stand
around where you are cooking, in the hopes of getting a lick at the
gold pan for salt remaining, when you have finished baking.</p>

<p>No, we didn&rsquo;t enthuse over the idea one bit, yet there was no
alternative that we could see, if we were to make the Smokey River, get
in a satisfactory prospect along the course, and finally fetch Peace
River Landing. Even supposing for one instant that we could bring
ourselves to kill one of our old pals, apart from feeling like
murderers, and something far worse when we sat down to grub, the
chances of ever making the Landing with a cumbersome raft were about a
thousand to one against. However, some decision had to be made, and
that right quickly, for the share left us consisted of less than a
week&rsquo;s supply. It seemed as though the others must have had it in
their minds, that after taking perhaps a day to make a
decision&mdash;which is exactly what we did---it might take four or
five days to catch them up, and we should have food, for just that
time.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, we stacked our packs, cached our tools,
and hit the trail back with three days&rsquo; grub between us.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h3>

<h4>THE RETURN TRAIL.</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;d no worry about catching up with the others. We knew only
too well that the first river would bring their outfit up all standing.
They were all downright good fellows, but never cut out for this sort
of thing.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there they all were, sitting on the banks of the
Athabaska, contemplating that uninviting flood. They looked a bit
sheepish, but it was no use grousing, the only thing to do was to make
the best of a bad job and get on, so we scouted up river until we found
a canoe, which we brought down and started the ferrying. A hundred
pounds at a time was the maximum load when shooting these rapids.</p>

<p>We had found a very suitable spot, where the canoe would lie snugly
under the bank whilst we loaded her up, and a nice little bay lower
down on the opposite side for an eddy. It was a bad spot as far as the
river went, for it was in full flood, but it was in excellent shoving
off place, and a good spot for landing. Furthermore, there was a level
bank, without tree or scrub for towing the canoe up river on the far
side ready for the shoot back.</p>

<p>Having got half the provisions over, and two or three of the chaps,
I thought now was the moment to strike a bargain for provisions.
Somehow, I did not feel quite the same towards these fellows, and I
determined to get my whack out of them, so that Bill and I could pull
out on our own. I told them, quite frankly when I got half of them
parked on one side and half on the other side of the river, that they
could have the canoe and welcome, but in view of the few provisions
then had left us two, I did not feel obliged to waste any more time
ferrying them back. (I still think I took rather a mean advantage.)
Anyhow, it was soon happily settled&mdash;as far as I was concerned. We
got our fair whack of grub, and they got safely over the worst river in
the Nor&rsquo;-West in one of its worst moods.<br>
 To take a man over, he had to lie in the bottom of the canoe,
underneath the little wooden spreaders. The whole canoe is as light as
a feather, built of bark, and stitched with hide. Even with only one
man lying in the bottom and the other on his knees paddling, she is
pretty deeply loaded, and needs careful handling.</p>

<p>After the provisions and horses were all over, two fellows were
left. To save a journey I told them both to get into the canoe, and we
would make the final shoot. It was a ticklish job, and as I required
every inch of room, I had unwisely put the paddle on the bank, until
they settled themselves in the bottom. &ldquo;Being in all respects
ready for sea,&rdquo; or, as in this case, for the river, having her
nicely, if somewhat deeply trimmed, I turned her bow off with a hand on
each gunwhale at the stern, ready as she took the fast water, to vault
in&mdash;and it is a bit of a job vaulting into one of these tiny
craft, particularly as at the same moment you strike white water. A
shove, a jump, and I was in, at the same instant reaching down for the
paddle, which, to my horror, was not there. <i>I had left it on the
bank</i>. How it was managed, I really don&rsquo;t know, but I was over
the side in about half a split second, and gave the canoe a terrific
tug that stopped her way, and actually, by some miracle brought her
back out of the rapids and into the eddy. The chaps lying in the bottom
did not realise what had happened, until I told them. They both looked
a bit green, and I&rsquo;ll say it gave me some jar. In any case, I
decided to take more time, and more care, so I left one on the beach,
and made two journeys of it, this time with safety.</p>

<p>Next morning, the other party struck the trail, but something had
happened to Bill&rsquo;s feet, and he was two days before he could get
his boots on, and, as we had to eat something every day, our provisions
again became perilously low. However, when we did catch the other party
up, they had been sitting a corresponding number of days on the bank of
the next river. Perhaps the saying &ldquo;We&rsquo;re from the Black
Hills, we ain&rsquo;t no tenderfeet&rdquo; did get rubbed in a bit.
That was in return for all the hot air Bill and I had to put up with
when away from water, and I must admit I got a certain amount of fun
out of pulling their legs, anyway.</p>

<p>For the last week before striking civilisation, provisions
completely petered out, and we lived on the inner bark of jack pines
and sourdocks. This inner bark is mainly resin, and as none of us had
used a razor since we had started the trail, we all had pretty good
healthy beards, which, when mixed up with this resin, turned them into
useful doormats. Still, we were not bothering about our outward
appearance, so much as out inward feelings, and great were the
rejoicings when we met an outward bound outfit, on the same quest from
which we were returning. We were able to trade a rifle, and ammunition,
for some good old sow-belly, beans, and tea, and had our first square
meal for a month.</p>

<p>Bill and I actually arrived back in Edmonton with our horses, a
rifle, half a cup of rice, and three cents between us. At that time
Edmonton was full of returned prospectors as a result of the great
disaster which had befallen the overland trail. It was a saying in
those parts that you could find your way from Edmonton to the Klondyke,
via the overland trail, by the bones of men and horses that had died by
the way. Very little was heard of it outside the country, in fact, the
north is notorious for its silence, both of nature and man. A more
silent man than the Hudson Bay trapper and trader, and the old time
prospector, it would be hard to find.</p>

<p>Many outfits set out from Edmonton on this terrible overland trail
with little or no idea of what they were going to run up against.</p>

<p>One amazing ass started on a bicycle, with bottles of Bovril
strapped on behind.</p>

<p>The trouble commenced in the earlier days, when they got away
insufficiently &ldquo;grub staked.&rdquo; Having gone so far and taken
such an appalling time to cover the distance, which on paper, of
course, looked trifling&mdash;they found themselves with insufficient
provisions to complete the journey. Many would push on and on, in the
faint hopes of the trail improving and their being able to make better
time; also, in the fond hope of finding game. Very nearly everybody was
confident they could rely on the country to replenish their larder. At
last, when the bitter truth was borne in on them, they were truly
between the devil and the deep sea. With the Rocky Mountains, forming
an impassable barrier on one side, and the prairie with its muskegs and
lakes on the other, they, like us, just had to decide whether or no
they would push on, or face about and go back. Naturally, an outfit
would push as long as ever there was the slightest chance, and often,
even longer. Then, in final desperation, they would at last be driven
into turning back, both men and horses by this time terribly emaciated
and weak, through hardships and short commons. They would then meet an
outward-bound outfit, who, by the unwritten law of the North-West,
could do no less than grub stake them; that is, give them sufficient to
eat for a few days at least. This act automatically lessened the
outward bound outfit&rsquo;s chances of getting through and so the bad
work went on, outfit after outfit, pushing away north, having to reduce
their own stock by helping those who were starving on their way back,
only to land in the same predicament themselves. The cumulative effect
almost beggars description.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that it was not a case of just a few men,
but of thousands. The total number will never be known, but to my mind,
it would be no exaggeration to say that at least ten thousand men lost
their lives on the overland trail. Outfits, made up of experienced men,
well provisioned, frequently with a sectional boar and every
contrivance that years of experience in that country could suggest,
came to grief; their whole expedition sapped and crippled, in efforts
to save others.</p>

<p>I was invited to join up with an outfit of this description when
first we arrived in Edmonton. Their supplies ran to a full ton, not
including the sectional boat they had. These men were real old timers
and I should have been one of their party, only for the fact that I was
an utter greenhorn, and did not realise, until it was too late, that an
invitation though given in seemingly quite a casual manner, was meant
in all seriousness. By the time I did wake up, I had made arrangements
with my own chum and the others to forge our own trail.</p>

<p>As it turned out I should not have been a scrap better off anyhow,
for, despite their experience, none of them were ever heard of
again.</p>

<p>Yes, Edmonton was full of men just broke to the world, who had what
they stood up in, and absolutely nothing else. So when Bill and I got
back with all our worldly wealth comprised in the half cup of rice and
three cents, it was not long before I hit the trail for happier hunting
grounds.</p>

<p>We decided in the circumstances, it was best for us each to play his
own hand, so we parted, and within a week I found myself cow punching
on the prairies.</p>

<p>There were three or four of us cowboys with some thousands of head
of cattle to look after. Here again was a new experience. A happy life;
a careless life. The stars for your blanket, the prairies for your bed,
and your horse still your best friend. Cook what you have with you,
when you can and how you can. Plenty to eat, plenty to drink, nothing
much to do so long as long as you keep your eyes open, and the cattle
well under control. But heaven help you when one of those brief, but
terrific thunderstorms comes down and stampedes your bunch.</p>

<p>Some of these are fairly big horned beasts, and, in their maddened
stride, will rip up a horse like a piece of tissue paper. There is only
one thing to do and that is to get to the leaders of the rush, and head
them off. You work away from the wind, and so you throw the head round,
forming a huge circle, until, finally with luck, the head of the
stampede catches up with the stern. At that moment it is very necessary
to be on the outer rim, for as one end catches up with the other, so
they form literally a gigantic whirlpool and the whole lot run up
together in one solid mass. Not infrequently, a good bit of damage is
done, but that cannot be helped. You will know all about the damage if
you happen to be on the inside. Then there is only one way you will get
out and that is by walking across the backs of the steers; but you can
say &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; to your horse. This went on for a few weeks,
till, sitting by the camp fire one night, smoking and thinking things
out, I realised that what I had set myself out to do, namely, to make
just enough money to grub stake myself and to then head off again into
the mountains, was impossible, partly because I had determined this
time to try the west side, where there is less water and more gold.</p>

<p>The ordinary life led by a cowboy doesn&rsquo;t tend to gather in
the shekels, or perhaps it would be nearer the truth to say that it
isn&rsquo;t conducive to keeping them. Every so often a bunch of steers
has to be taken to the railway, or somewhere near thereto, and having
disposed of them, the temptation to &ldquo;blue&rdquo; one&rsquo;s
hard-earned wealth, in one great and glorious spree is usually too
great to be withstood. Not necessarily a drinking spree, because,
actually, there is little of that done in Canada.</p>

<p>For my part, I never spent five cents on drink until I had made the
grub stake which would carry me out of the country.</p>

<p>But a cowboy who has been out on the prairie, seen no one, spoken to
no one for weeks on end, must do all the crazy things that come into
his mind when he gets into civilisation. He is like a big boy let
loose.</p>

<p>The night I was considering all these things by the fire, there came
into my mind a promise I had made before I left England, that if things
went against me I <i>would</i> come back. There was no question about
my being up against it, and a promise is a promise. Furthermore, I
could gather together more money, on my own job at sea, than I ever
should cow punching, so, just as quickly as I made up my mind to get
out, I decided to go back.</p>

<p>It was with a horrible sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that
I sold, and said god-bye to my old pal Rufus. It hurt like hell, and
does even yet. Still, it had to be done, so I got it over as quickly as
possible and started off back to England in dead earnest.</p>

<p>I had become a hobo.</p>

<p>The term applies to anyone who is trying to beat the country. He is
not a tramp, as is generally known at home. He is best described as
&ldquo;a traveller without means of paying his way,&rdquo; an accepted
fact in the country, and it is a war of wits between the hobos and the
various means of transport, which in those days were mainly in the
hands of the C.P.R. Jumping trains, riding the blind baggage, or making
out on the rods were three of the recognized methods, and the brakies,
your natural enemies; who would think nothing of swinging a five pound
lynch pin on the end of a line, if they thought somebody was
&ldquo;riding the rods.&rdquo; If you were and unluckily got a crack on
the head, you simply fell off, and the train passed on. If you were
lucky and could get into a van you traveled in luxury. Another good
plan was to ride the blind baggage, the platform at the back of the
last car, but from which you are more easily expelled. The third and
last method is riding on the rods (suspension rods) under the car. That
is where I usually parked, for although the least comfortable, I always
found it the safest, and the place where one was sure to make the
longest journey undiscovered.</p>

<p>I still had with me my inseparable companion the banjo, also a small
sack in which I kept bacon and bread, my blankets, and another
companion, a piece of cheese. I asked, when I bought this cheese, for
the strongest the chap could find. It certainly was powerful. Perhaps
that was why I was so successful in making such long stretches without
being thrown off!</p>

<p>Anyway, I noticed that everyone gave it an astonishingly wide berth.
However, I eventually parted company with both my cheese, and my
blankets, my bread, and my bacon, through a mistaken sense of
hospitality on the part of a man in charge of one of the water
tanks.</p>

<p>These tanks are situated just so far apart, where the engine may
draw up in the otherwise uninhabited country and get water. I had
dropped off the fill my billy can, and the tanker, when he saw me
arrive, gave the usual salutation, &ldquo;Hullo, Bo. Where are you
going?&rdquo; My invariable reply was, &ldquo;Liverpool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a rule a hobo is making his way from one town to another, and the
vision of a man heading for Liverpool, England, seemed to strike
everyone as particularly humorous. It tickled this chap to the extent
that he would have me take, as he expressed it, &ldquo;a drop of
something with a kick.&rdquo; He was a decent fellow and meant well,
but whilst we were busy with our salutations the train sloped off with
my worldly possessions, and I was left the proud possessor of a banjo.
He was so sorry that I believe he would have stopped the train at the
next tank and had it held&mdash;had I urged him&mdash;until I had time
to catch it up. In any case he made an excuse to flag the next train
along, and whilst he was telling a little story to the brakie, I made
myself as comfortable as I could on the blind baggage, which landed me
as close to Winnipeg as I wanted to go.</p>

<p>I spent three weeks in that Prairie City; an exhibition was on at
the time, which for me proved fruitful, and enabled me to collect
sufficient currency to make the long to Montreal. I had not been many
hours in Winnpeg when I heard of a man who had built a house and was
trying to get it finished, by way of painting and so forth; but he was
a notoriously bad payer and the men that were working for him had quit,
as they could not get their money.</p>

<p>His name was Chamberlain, so I made my way over to where he lived
and dug him out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he want a painter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he wanted a painter. Was I a painter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;go right ahead and get it
finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did, though it was a pretty tall order. I found some paint brushes
and so forth and sailed in. We neither of us discussed wages. As a
matter of fact a painter&rsquo;s pay was three dollars a day, with
which I credited myself.</p>

<p>After my experiences with jamb piles and muskegs, work with a paint
brush, either in one hand or the other, was child&rsquo;s play, and, in
any case, I had served in the hardest school in which one can learn
painting, and that is a British sailing ship.</p>

<p>Chamberlain seemed tickled to death with the hours I worked and the
ginger I put into the job; in fact we became great friends, and he
cordially invited me to work any number of hours I cared. I took him at
his word. In the evening, I usually walked into the town and bought
myself provisions to cook overnight, which served me for the next day.
Good solid food, but no luxuries. One day old Chamberlain asked me
where I lived. I told him &ldquo;on the prairie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hell, you don&rsquo;t mean to tell me you sleep out there
every night, no wonder you get up early in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him that I had been sleeping out there for very nearly twelve
months. However he eventually made me take a room in the house. I did
for one night, and felt very nearly suffocated, and I gave up again in
favour of the open air.</p>

<p>The time finally came when the job was finished, and up till then no
mention of pay had passed between us; although some of the former
hands, in the goodness of their hearts, had walked all the way out to
where this house was situated on the prairie, to tender the information
that I should certainly never get any money. Well, I might, or again I
might not, but my impression was that I should get what I worked for.
We left it at that. Later on, Chamberlain informed me he was getting a
mortgage through on the house, and until that was through he could not
pay me.</p>

<p>He happened to tell me that his solicitors were Andrews and
Pitblado, and it also just happened that while working on the
exhibition grounds, I had made contact with Andrews, who was, at that
time, Mayor of Winnipeg. It came about that he met me on the grounds
where I was working and sent me over to bring a huge wooden form. The
band of the Black Watch were playing out there at the time, and one can
get an idea of the size of the form, when four forms accommodated the
whole band. They were made of just rough hewn timber. I thought it a
tall order, but as I was in the very pink of condition I actually
managed to hoist it on my shoulder and proudly marched off with it
across the grounds. By luck, I met Andrews, who asked me a bit
fluently, what I thought I was doing. I told him I was carrying a form,
and that, furthermore he had sent me for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put the damn thing down. Do you think I sent you alone.
Where&rsquo;s the other man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, I had not seen him, but nothing would suit Andrews but to
leave the form there for the others to collect whilst he took me away
and put me on another job, which was all to do with ropes and tackles,
and right into my hand. I may say that I had casually told him when
walking across the grounds, in reply to his enquiry, that I was a
sailor, had been out on the gold rush, and was then a hobo, bound back
to Liverpool to pick up my job again, and we became quite good
friends.</p>

<p>This was the chap who was getting the mortgage through for
Chamberlain, and to whom, by good luck, I had to apply for my dollars,
so, having got Chamberlain to sign my time sheet, I trotted off down
town to interview Andrews. I had enough money coming to me
then&mdash;if I could collect it- to see me through to Montreal, no
longer as a hobo, but as a real, self-respecting passenger&mdash;what a
change! When I asked for Mr. Andrews the clerk accommodated his tone of
voice to my appearance, which, beyond being clean, was hardly
millionairish, and the few words we had quickly brought Andrews out of
his office to see what was going on.</p>

<p>I must say his office was reached by a steep flight of stairs, which
led directly into the street, and down which I was proposing to
toboggan the clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, my lad,&rdquo; said Andrews, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s all
the row about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him.</p>

<p>He whistled when he saw the account, and told me the mortgage was
not through. At the same time he knew exactly where I stood, and, to
make a long story short (good fellow that he was) he paid me in full on
the spot.</p>

<p>I then journeyed down to the Manor Bar, where kindred spirits used
to foregather, and, to their surprise, stood them all a good round of
drinks. One of the chaps who had quit Chamberlain&rsquo;s place before
I took on, and who had been cocksure I should not get my pay, asked me
&ldquo;where I had got the wad.&rdquo; I told him.</p>

<p>Said he, &ldquo;How did you manage to collect it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of course,&rdquo; said I&mdash;trying a good leg
pull&mdash;&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want to go round to these
lawyer&rsquo;s places eating humble pie; you want to go in and threaten
to break up the furniture and take them to pieces. Throw things about a
bit, and say, if they don&rsquo;t ante up, that you&rsquo;ll include
them in a quick passage to the street. Just let them know you are some
sort of a chap. See then, how quickly they will come across with your
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gazed at me the whole time I was talking, and then just walked
out.</p>

<p>Half an hour or so later I had boarded the train at the Depot, and
was sitting on the steps of the car yarning with a few of the fellows
who had come to see me off, when another pal came on to the platform
roaring with laughter, and said to me, &ldquo;Say, what on earth did
you tell Charlie?&rdquo; When I told him the yarn, he said he had just
come past Andrews and Pitblado&rsquo;s office in time to see Charlie
thrown down the stairs into the street. We were still laughing over
poor Charlie as the train drew out, and I started on the last lap for
Liverpool.</p>

<p>Having made a good grub stake in Winnipeg, and being able to stick
to one train for a change, it seemed a very short time before I was in
Montreal, with its familiar ships and shipping. Here I was back on my
own territory, and in touch with my old friend, the sea. My troubles,
as far as the trail was concerned, were over. Crossing the
ocean&mdash;or even going round the world&mdash;presented less of a
problem than did a few hundred miles by land. Looking back over it all,
I felt I had achieved my object to some extent. At any rate, I had been
up through the North-West. I&rsquo;d tried it out, I&rsquo;d had a
great time, and I&rsquo;d got back&mdash;the next bit to Liverpool
hardly counted. Admittedly I had gone broke; on the other hand I
<i>had</i> got back, which was more than thousands and thousands of
others had done. There were hundreds in Winnipeg alone&mdash;many of
whom were there when I arrived on the way out, and were still there
when I left on the way back&mdash;who, poor devils, had no idea how to
make their way back home.</p>

<p>It was not long before I was on board ship, and in my own element
again. I was not on board in the capacity of an officer. I took the
first job that was going, and that was cattle-man&mdash;not very
thrilling, with all the beasts tied up by their head stalls, and I
could not help but compare them with similar animals out on the range.
Here they were in their hundreds; there they had been in their
thousands. Neither were the cattle-men quite the type one meets
&ldquo;punching&rdquo; on the prairie; they were inclined to be a wee
bit impulsive at the wrong time. For instance, when I came down a bit
late for the first day&rsquo;s dinner, every scrap of food had been
cleaned up, on the basis of &ldquo;first come, first served.&rdquo;
Perhaps I was more at home on this job than they had realised. However,
believe me, it never happened again, and when a few of the niceties of
shipboard life had been duly instilled, they proved quite good
fellows&mdash;if a bit crude.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h3>

<h4>BACK TO SEA</h4>

<p>Two o&rsquo;clock one bright spring morning found us &ldquo;tied
up&rdquo; in the Hornby Dock, Liverpool, just a little over twelve
months since I had left. As all my money had been exhausted in making
my way to Montreal, I stepped off the ship with a pair of buckskin
pants, serge shirt, huge sombrero hat, and the world before me
again.</p>

<p>A few miles hard walking brought me to my old rooms, where I must
hide myself until such time as I could have a suit of clothes made by
my friendly old tailor.</p>

<p>What agony it was to encase oneself again in boiled shirt and stiff
collar, but it had to be done; respectability once more, and then a
ship. There was no time to lose as I hadn&rsquo;t a penny in the world,
and I certainly was not going to apply at home for money.</p>

<p>Down to the docks I went for an interview with old Jack Rattery
(sic), the Marine Superintendent of the African Royal Mail. He was
commonly known as &ldquo;Three Fingered Jack&rdquo; having had two of
them bitten off by a negro down the West Coast. Bully Waters at one
time had been his mate, and they were great pals; also two of a kidney.
Furthermore Rattery had told me, when I left the <i>Niagara</i> that
Bully Waters, despite the lurid passages at arms and wordy battles that
had taken place between us, had, to my unbounded astonishment, given me
a most glowing character. This being so, I knew I was sure of a ship as
soon as Capt. Rattery could find me one. He wanted to know where I had
been. I merely told him, &ldquo;Where ships don&rsquo;t go. But
I&rsquo;m looking for a ship now, sir.&ldquo;</p>

<p>I had also seen a brand new ship in dock about to sail on her maiden
voyage, and I asked him to appoint me to her. Good fellow, he gave me
the job. Right glad I was to be back again on pay, with the hopes of
wiping out some of the huge debts that had accumulated with my tailor
and elsewhere. Sextant to buy, telescope to buy, glasses to buy,
instruments of various kinds, books, in fact, the whole complete
outfit, including uniform and mufti, for I had sold everything before I
had left. Still, what matters; I was back in the good old familiar
surroundings, again serving my eccentric mistress. Good solid pieces of
gold rolling in every voyage from over the pay desk, instead of digging
them out of the earth&mdash;much more of it too&mdash;so why worry?
Everyone would soon get paid and I&rsquo;d quickly make enough to hit
the lone trail again.</p>

<p>Being a new ship and the biggest on the run, we gave a banquet in
every port, and we did not have to be looking for the makings of the
banquet with a rifle. Any amount of game here, if it was in the frig.
When we got down to Lagos, Opobo and Calabar, the guests were nearly
all native chiefs, and we had to entertain them. These chaps are big
noises in Africa, and come down in their war canoes, pulling twenty
paddles a side. The canoes are wonderful pieces of craftsmanship, and
take years to build. It was a touchy business getting the different
tribal chiefs to the gangway, and on board, without any fighting. They
are all pretty warlike, and ready to jump at each other&rsquo;s throats
on the slightest pretext. At a signal from the officer on the gangway,
up they came dashing to the side ladder (and they have a speed of
anything up to ten knots) and if another war canoe were slow in getting
away, they would think nothing of ramming it, and if that happened,
then the fat would be in the fire. It was only by virtue of the tact of
the white officer on the gangway that many a full blown scrap was
nipped in the bud</p>

<p>Once on board, they were kept separate as much as possible by the
whites, and eventually, marshalled down to the saloon. Some of these
chaps had been educated in England, even at Oxford of Cambridge, but
curiously enough, as soon as they get back to their tribe, the veneer
of civilisation almost invariably drops right away and they re-adopt
both native habits and clothes. It is a bit of a shock to have one of
these war canoes come alongside, and a fellow in native rig stroll up
the gangway, hold out his hand, and greet you in fluent English, wit a
full Oxford accent&mdash;we used this educated section to help the
white men separate the more primitive minded&mdash;and they needed
separating!</p>

<p>On one occasion in Old Calabar, we were entertaining about fifty
native chiefs. They had been a bit jumpy from the start, but, with a
little tact, we managed to keep peace. Everything went on happily, and
we got them divided up and sitting round the long saloon table, but by
the time they had imbibed a certain amount of &ldquo;bubbly water:"
they were just about fit for anything. We had a Piper on board, who, as
a rule used to march up and down the promenade deck above, and pipe
during dinner. The Captain had a brain storm in the middle of this
dinner that very nearly sent up the balloon. He passed an order for the
Piper, who, without any warning, marched right up one side of the long
table and down the other with his deafening skirl. This set our guests
fairly dancing in their chairs, eyes glaring and hands itching for a
spear of a knife or any other professional instrument. It only needed
one man to start in and the whole pack would have been on their hind
legs, with anything near the shape of a knife they could grab off the
table. For a minute or two it looked bad, and the skipper did look a
bit glum. However nobody moved. The white men studiously kept on
talking, and so managed to keep the others in their seats. After a bit,
the hotheads also cooled down and the dinner went along happily up to
the ice cream stage.</p>

<p>Most of them had never seen ice-cream before, much less tasted it.
The first chap to put a spoonful in his mouth just went up like a
rocket.</p>

<p>Ice to them is just the same as heat; they think it burns. It was
fortunate for us that there were only two or three of them who got the
ice-cream down at the same time, but believe me, they needed some
pacifying. Only the fact that everybody else stuck fast to their seats,
and seized these fellows by their wrists, whilst others went on eating
their ice-cream, gradually brought them to their senses again. They are
proud and touchy chaps, and really thought a game had been played on
them.</p>

<p>That voyage ended my West Coast experience, and I have never been
down there since, despite the saying that, once a fellow has the coast
in his veins, he can never leave it. It certainly has an extraordinary
attraction of its own, that must be experienced to be realised. A
fortnight out of Liverpool, and it&rsquo;s back to nature with a bump.
Natives, pure blooded negroes, perfect physical specimens, but as full
of superstition as they can hold. Anything their childlike minds
can&rsquo;t grasp, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oh, Massa, he be Ju-ju too
much.&rdquo; Show them the simplest conjuring trick and they&rsquo;ll
run a mile, I appeared to take a two shilling piece out of one
chap&rsquo;s nose. He never let go of his nose for the rest of that
day, in case another should come. Awful thieves, but perfectly
trustworthy, whilst you watch them.</p>

<p>An officer, who had been mate of one of the Branch boats for years
at Lagos, had a perfectly marvellous record for good steady work
amongst his boys and he was hardly ever known to have a case or bale
broached on his ship. One day I asked him how on earth he managed it,
for certainly he paid far less attention than was customary to his
loading from the liner, and discharging ashore. After much urging, in a
burst of confidence and gin, he let me into his secret. He had a glass
eye, also a spare one. If they were handling any cargo that held
special attraction, he just went down below, extracted his eye, and
placed it on a convenient bale and said, &ldquo;Now you Bushmen, I go
for watch you all time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Entering at Forcados, a 5,000 ton ship, big as she is, can navigate
up the creeks for scores of miles. Mangrove swamps on either hand most
of the way, no room to turn and little room to pass. In some places it
is so narrow that her nose must be driven up into the jungle, whilst
the tide is allowed to swing her stern, and so negotiate a sharp bend.
Here and there clearings with native villages, and men who never saw a
wheelbarrow, yet stand and stare at a modern steamship, a fortnight out
from Liverpool. No pilots; just local knowledge gained by Officers and
Captain through years of experience. Here&rsquo;s a whitewashed tree
where you take the right fork for Benin. There&rsquo;s a barrel on a
stump, where you turn off for somewhere else. High pay, yes, and one
earns it. The life served me in another way, as, being Second Officer
of a Royal Mail and passenger ship for a certain time, qualified me for
a commission in the Royal Naval Reserve, also my Master&rsquo;s Ticket,
which I had yet to get.</p>

<p>One way and another, I had had a good time, but had lost a lot of
necessary sea time through periodically chasing some hare-brained idea.
Still in the end, I made it all up and even caught up with chaps of my
own age. For one thing I had never lost a minute over my exams, by
failing&mdash;and it&rsquo;s not uncommon to fail three or four times
for one ticket. I know one chap who went up seven times for his
Master&rsquo;s certificate. Then again, by taking the West Coast run, I
got better promotion and my time counted more. Anyhow, I went up, when
I got home, and, my luck still holding, passed for Master at
twenty-three.</p>

<p>I had now the world at my feet, or so I thought anyway, and when I
had had a sufficiently good time I marched off to find a ship, but, of
course, only when funds were completely exhausted. I still had had a
tremendous amount of leeway to make up and debts to pay, owing to my
little jaunt to the North-West in the back of my mind, for as I have
said before, I only came home with the intention of making sufficient
money to outfit myself and go again. As a matter of fact, I became
involved in a much more attractive scheme, which rather eclipsed the
cold of Canada, and that was running sandalwood from New Guinea to
China.</p>

<p>New Guinea is one of the few remaining unspoiled spots of the world,
where there is a fortune waiting for those sufficiently enterprising to
take up the export of sandalwood, sandalwood oil and so forth.
Furthermore, New Guinea is the only place where the Bird of Paradise
can be found, and though he is merely a glorified edition of old Jim
Crow, he has a wonderful market. Then again, there is gold up the Fly
River, and many other things to attract those unfortunately born with
the love of the unorthodox; wanderlust, or whatever you like to call
it. However, nothing more need be said about New Guinea, for it came to
nothing, in fact the idea was effectually scotched by my getting
married. My wife made one stipulation, and that was that if I went on
that expedition, she went too. It is no climate for a white woman, so
there the matter ended.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h3>

<h4>SHANGHAIED</h4>

<p>Having got my Master&rsquo;s Certificate, I decided to try the
Atlantic again, and I&rsquo;m not likely to forget my first ship; she
was a real poem. It had become, as usual, a financial necessity to find
a ship, and one day, as I was walking along Castle Street, Liverpool.,
I noticed Greenshield, Cowie &amp; Co.&rsquo;s plate. These were the
owners of the old Knight Line, under whom I served in the four-masted
barque <i>Knight of St. Michael</i>. On the impulse of the moment, I
slipped in and asked for the managing director, and was shown in the
sanctum of sanctums. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; in his deep sonorous voice,
he &ldquo;remembered me quite well,&rdquo; and we talked over some of
the old days. Yes, he would appoint me to one of their steamers, in
fact &ldquo;the very best of the Line, the <i>Knight Bachelor</i>,
lying in London; join her right away.&rdquo; Very hearty and very
blunt, he held out his hand to say good-bye. This was all very well,
but I wanted to know in what capacity. &ldquo;Third Mate,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I am looking for a
berth as at least Second Mate, or even Mate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, Lightoller, you will be no time as Third
Mate. In view of the fact that you served so long and so loyally in our
sailing ships, we can never forget&mdash;&ldquo; And so on and so
forth.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, I allowed myself to be bamboozled into
going out of that office with my sailing orders in my pocket.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a good ship, and the
Western Ocean, and I will take good care that I am going to get my step
up pretty soon.&rdquo; I still had malarial fever in my veins, and well
I knew it on the train journey down and across London. I arrived at
Tilbury Dock feeling like the complete West African dishcloth. All I
wanted was to get my head down, and forget I was alive. I had, in my
subconscious mind, all the comforts that one associates with the Royal
Mail. A nice airy cabin, a bunk with clean white sheets, a boy to
attend you, and practically every wish anticipated. Doctor, stewards
and all the rest of it. Arriving at Tilbury Dock, I asked a porter
wearily where the Knight boat was lying. He replied, &ldquo;Oh, just
near by, sir. Over the bridge,&rdquo; and suggested he should put my
baggage on a truck and run it over. &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said I, my one
anxiety being to get to my cabin, and try to forget this damnable
fever. We trudged along, I simply following the porter, conscious of
little but a terrific temperature. Suddenly the porter stopped.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;why have you stopped?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Here is your ship, sir.&rdquo; I looked up. What a horror! About
the dirtiest thing I&rsquo;d ever clapped eyes on. Her rusty iron sides
streaked with the horrible overflow from the cattle she had evidently
been carrying. Smelling like nothing on earth. &ldquo;But this
isn&rsquo;t the <i>Knight Bachelor</i>, surely?&rdquo; I exclaimed.
&ldquo;Oh, no sir, the <i>Knight Bachelor</i> sailed last week;this is
the <i>Knight Companion</i>.&rdquo; Had I had the strength she would
certainly have been no companion of mine. However, I was just about at
the end of my tether, and thought, &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s get on
board, and between some blankets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The deck was simply a jungle of old cattle pens, ashes, coal, dirt
and filth of every description.</p>

<p>A man came up to me and asked me what I wanted. I said I wanted the
Mate. In a very nasal voice he informed me he was the Mate. I really
thought he was pulling my leg, and I told him abruptly that I
didn&rsquo;t feel like joking with him, &ldquo;<i>Where was the
Mate?</i>&rdquo; This time he asserted, a little more forcibly, that he
<i>was</i> the Mate. I apologized, and said I was the Third Mate. His
reply was, &ldquo;When are you going to turn to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to turn in,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Can you tell me
where I can find the steward who will show me to my cabin?&rdquo;</p>

<p><br>
 &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says my bucco, of the collarless flannel shirt,
&ldquo;I guess, in this ship, we find our own cabins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After climbing over a pile of coal and ashes, I found mine. It
really wanted scraping out&mdash;before it was washed!</p>

<p>I know I was a fool, but really malaria, when you do get it, simply
takes the heart out of you, and all I wanted was to get my head in line
with my heels, get under a pile of blankets, and forget the world. I
managed to dig out some blankets, and when the Mate found out how
thoroughly bad I was, he became pretty decent about it and did what he
could.</p>

<p>The West Coast sufferer&rsquo;s remedy is simple, if drastic, and
consists of a tin of quinine powder and a packet of cigarette papers.
Put as much quinine in a cigarette paper as it will hold, seal it up
and swallow it. After a few of these, a couple of brass bands will
start up in your head; but you get used to that also, and as it does
not last more than a couple of days, one is soon about again.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, I had one more violent attack after this, and one
only. That happened when bound down the river on that voyage out. I had
one final and terrific upheaval off the Nore Lightship, which I thought
was going to be the end of all things; it was actually the end of old
malaria.</p>

<p>I have often grinned over the way I got shanghaied into that
wretched ship, although it was a glorious voyage. Out to the West
Indies, and round to the Gulf of Mexico, Barbados, Portobello, Vera
Cruz, Tampico, Progresso, and all those old historical places with
which the West Indies teems. One could easily write a book about each
individual place, its inhabitants and their quaint and comical customs,
though this applies more to the islands and the northern side of the
Gulf. The inhabitants of the southern and western parts are mainly the
Latin race in about its worst form. An Englishman appreciates a joke,
but not when it&rsquo;s pointed with a knife, and no matter whether
it&rsquo;s Mexican, Columbian, or Venezuelan, they are an untrustworthy
lot, and forever digging buttonholes into their fellow men.</p>

<p>Whereas the West Indian negro is just a child of nature, full of fun
and harmless devilment, stinks like a polecat, but sings divinely. They
are in fact, born songsters. See them sitting in a row, with ragged
hats, say on the New Orleans Levee, dangling their bare and often dirty
feet over the stringer piece, is a sight in itself. Up and down the
line goes a word a joke, and a deep throated laugh. Then, without the
slightest premeditation, the whole line bursts into a quaint, chanting
song, each part perfectly taken and harmonized. If you don&rsquo;t have
creeps running up into your back hair, then you&rsquo;ve no ear for
music. And the water round the islands, clear as crystal; in fact there
are mighty few places where you cannot see your anchor at five fathoms.
All-coloured fish swimming about, great big rainbow-hued conch shells,
and, of course, our old friend, John Shark.</p>

<p>The natives here, like the West African natives, are born to the
water, and will dive off the rail, after a threepenny bit had actually
touched the water, and pick it up long before it reaches the bottom.
One evening we thought we would have a try and bringing up some of
these bright coloured conch shells ourselves. We had seen how the
natives go down, and how when they got to the bottom they slipped their
hands under the shells, detaching them from the rock, and brought them
up stuck to their hands. This sport came near to be our undoing.</p>

<p>That evening. whilst we were leaning over the rail, smoking and
yarning, someone spotted a huge conch shell a little way out from our
quarter, Like a fool, one of the chaps was going to have that shell!
So, clothed in a birthday suit, he jumped up on the rail and dived over
the side , and down. After a struggle he got his hand between the fish
and rock. The fish then attached itself to his hand, and short of
putting the shell in between his feet and pulling with all his might,
it was impossible to get the thing off, for your fingers are sucked
right into the shell itself. This however, did not worry him. Up he
came, but at an angle that took him still further from the ship. Once
again on the surface, he waved his capture above his head, still stuck
to his fist, swimming slowly at the same time, towards the gangway. At
this moment, we spotted a sinister black shape, still some distance
away, and below water. One of the chaps sang out, &ldquo;Come on, you
ass, buck up.&rdquo; He caught an anxious inflexion in the voice, and
glanced round on the surface of the water, but there was nothing to be
seen from water level, so he thought it was just his imagination, and
continued to swim leisurely towards the ship. Two or three of us rushed
down the gangway, whilst another fellow hailed him, and this time there
was no mistake about the anxiety. He looked again, and there, sure
enough, was that black fin, now cutting the water like a knife and
about a hundred yards away from him. He had not twenty feet to go, but,
as he said later, the leaden feet one experiences in dreams, trying to
run away from some overtaking horror, was mild compared with his
feeling of pure unadulterated terror. Of course, try as he might, he
could not get that infernal shell off his hand. He went through all the
gyrations imaginable, trying to swim with it, trying to tow it, trying
to do anything that would bring him to the gangway. By this time, we
were down the gangway and on the platform, waiting to make a grab.
There was no boat in the water, and no time to lower one, so no help
was available from that source. Did he bring his feet up when we
grabbed him under the armpits? Did he not! We beat John Shark by a good
ten yards. After that episode, however, diving for shells became
unpopular&mdash;much to the amusement of the natives.</p>

<p>A round of the islands and we loaded up in New Orleans for home.
Deep loaded with grain, and cattle on deck, she wallowed her weary way,
far worse than the proverbial canal barge. All went comparatively well
until crossing the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Here, owing to the
shallowness of the water, a wall sided sea gets up that is the terror
of all small and moderate-sized ships. It is well known to all Western
Ocean sailors, and with a small deep loaded ship, it behoves one to
treat it with respect and heave to in plenty of time.</p>

<p>One afternoon it blew up and there was every indication that we were
in for a dirty night.</p>

<p>The <i>Knight Companion</i> was really an Eastern trader; so was the
Captain. The ship was not built to face the Western Ocean, and the
Skipper lacked Western Ocean experience. She was running heavily all
afternoon, and when I left the bridge, I half suggested that it was
getting time to heave-to. The skipper jokingly, though, half seriously
said, &ldquo;Oh, I thought you Western Ocean sailors were never afraid
of bad weather.&rdquo; There was nothing more to say, so I went below.
Even then she was lurching and labouring far too heavily for anyone to
remain long in his bunk, so I made myself up a bed on the floor of my
cabin and jammed myself in as best I could. The pitch and heave to the
following sea rapidly grew worse, one could feel her difficulty in
rising and getting away from the seas racing after her, and threatening
to overwhelm her. An hour or so later I felt that horrible and
unmistakable feeling of a ship pooping. A sea had broken over her
stern, and she shuddered horribly as it tore its way along the decks,
crushing and smashing everything in its wake.</p>

<p>There was no object in dashing up on deck and chance getting washed
overboard; if the ship were going down, one might as sell stay where
one was. A few minutes later I felt her broach-to, and over she went,
almost on her beam ends, being pounded all the time by the huge seas
breaking on her. After a few long drawn minutes she eventually came to,
head on to wind and righted.</p>

<p>Of course, by this time, my cabin, along with everybody&rsquo;s was
all afloat. Water everywhere, but evidently some of the fires in the
stokehold were still alight, and the ship was able to keep head to
wind. I went on deck. What a ghastly wreck! The sea had simply crushed
down flat the whole of the cattle pens fore and aft, and cattle in all
shapes and forms were lying dying, maimed, bruised and broken, all over
the ship. Numbers, had, or course, mercifully been washed overboard.
Unfortunately, steam had been left on deck, and was running through
many of the pipes, which only added to the horror. There was nothing
for it but to release what we could, and simply let them wash
overboard. Seas breaking over us all the time, but the main aim and
object was to save the ship.</p>

<p>We remained hove-to for the best part of forty-eight hours before
the gale eased down and we were able to keep her away again for our
home port. So much for the Western Ocean in general and the Grand Banks
in particular. When we did get home, I wasted no time in getting
ashore, and finding something a little more orderly and seaworthy.</p>

<p>After another year or so of knocking around, a good part of the time
spent ashore, mostly doing things of not much interest to anyone but
myself, I discovered one day that I had arrived at the mature age of
twenty-five, and it struck me that it was just about time that I quit
this roving and settled down to something really permanent. I fully
realised that I might quite easily have been much ahead of where I was;
still, I never regretted the time I had lost. I had had good times and
I had enjoyed them. Experience is always a good companion, if you look
at it that way. Granted there had been a considerable element of luck
that had always enabled me to catch up; in fact, in the end, when I
joined the White Star Line, I was still ahead of the average age.<br>
</p>

<h3>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h3>

<h4>WHITE STAR LINE</h4>

<p>So, in the year of Our Lord 1900, armed with a letter of
introduction and full of good resolutions, I made my appearance at 30
James Street, Liverpool, the headquarters of the wonderful White Star
Line. It was customary in those days to have to wait anything up to six
months before getting an appointment, so, feeling very virtuous at
having done the great deed, I slipped away for a few months&rsquo;
holiday. Within a week, to my utter disgust, I had orders to report;
and on arriving in Liverpool, found I was appointed to the R.M.S.
<i>Medic</i>, the first of the five huge White Star Liners that were to
open the new Australian service. I suppose I ought to have felt
flattered at being picked out from among the many, but it was rather a
staggerer, since all my outfit happened to be roaming somewhere round
the railways, more or less lost, and certainly unobtainable.</p>

<p>When the Marine Superintendent told me the ship was sailing within a
couple of days, I blurted out, &ldquo;Good Lord, I&rsquo;ve no
clothes.&rdquo; His reply was short, and to the point. &ldquo;Get
some.&rdquo; I did, and rambled off to Australia with slightly less
than half an outfit. But it was the White Star Line, the summit, at
that time, of my ambitions.</p>

<p>What a change after that precious old cattle truck. Here everything
spotless and clean; everything just-so, discipline strict, but in no
way irksome. Navigation such as I had never known it.</p>

<p>I soon fell into things and became frightfully keen at my job.
Crowds of passengers and plenty going on. I lasted a whole voyage, and
then I sent in my resignation in preference to being fired! Undoubtedly
my own fault for again doing those things usually left undone by the
discreet and wisely minded.</p>

<p>It came about this way. We were lying in Sydney, in Neutral Bay, and
for one reason and another our sailing had been delayed. She was a show
ship, the biggest that had ever been out there, and the people in
Australia gave the time of our lives. Everything and everywhere it was
the <i>Medic</i>.</p>

<p>I was always extremely fond of small boat sailing, and it was partly
this amusement that got me into the scrape. I, as fourth officer (since
she did not carry a fifth), with four midshipmen, had rigged up one of
the ship&rsquo;s boats. We fitted her with a false keel, and used to
sail her all over the harbour, that most wonderful of harbours in the
wide world, and the boat was no slouch either.</p>

<p>One day we had been across to Rosecutter&rsquo;s Bay (sic), and, as
an excuse for the jaunt, had taken sandbags to fill up with sand and
bring back for the purpose of holystoning the decks. Now, standing in
the middle of the harbour is a rock, on which is built a fort, known as
Fort Dennison (sic), or more commonly Pinchgut, owing to the starvation
diet on which the convicts were kept whilst confined in the fort.
Mounted on this fort is a huge gun, that covers the whole of the
harbour.</p>

<p>We were coming off with a light breeze, clad in our white ducks,
thoroughly enjoying life, and went to pass windward of the fort. The
boat did not seem inclined to lie up to it, and as it was of no
consequence whatever, we ran close under the lee. One of the boys,
Watson by name, lying on his back along one of the thwarts and looking
up as we passed close under the fort, noticed the projecting muzzle of
this huge gun. &ldquo;What a lark,&rdquo; he blurted out, &ldquo;to
fire that gun some night. Wouldn&rsquo;t it shake &lsquo;em up?&rdquo;
I looked up, and as they say in Yankeeland, fell for it. It was a
proposition that appealed. So, with each one sworn to secrecy, we set
about what proved to be a task that took over six weeks to accomplish,
but it was worth it.</p>

<p>First, there was the powder to get, and, to avoid suspicion, it had
to be obtained in very small quantities. There was fuse to get also,
but before we committed ourselves very deeply, bearing in mind our very
limited exchequer, it behoved us to go off some night and reconnoiter,
and find out what sort of gun it was, and if it <i>could</i> be fired.
For this purpose we commandeered a scow from Cavill&rsquo;s Baths that
lie off the Domain.</p>

<p>Sydney Harbour is reeking with sharks, as in fact is the whole of
the water round Australia; any baths therefore, must have a shark-proof
netting, and it is customary to have floating pontoons, on which are
built the dressing rooms, and from which the shark-proof netting is
suspended. These iron tanks rapidly become fouled in the warm water,
and it was for the purpose of cleaning these tanks that this one man
scow was used. It was capable of carrying one man, and one drum of tar,
with a fair amount of safety.</p>

<p>Two of the boys were wise, and at this juncture backed out of the
escapade, so the remaining two and myself boarded our noble scow one
night, and proceeded to paddle out into the middle of Sydney Harbour.
Our good Guardian Angel must have been pretty wide awake. Although it
was dead calm and the surface like glass, we could not paddle quickly
because the water came over the bows. As to what would have happened if
the slightest breeze had sprung up, doesn&rsquo;t need a very vivid
imagination. However, I cannot say it bothered us; we wanted to get
there and we got there, climbing up the lightning conductor and into
the turret-like top of the fort.</p>

<p>The interior was a huge circular well, round which this massive gun
carriage was supposed to revolve. The gun was an old muzzle loader, and
I should think the whole outfit weighed somewhere in the region of
twenty tons.</p>

<p>I was walking round the parapet on the inside with cat-like tread,
looking to see what I could find, when I suddenly realised there was a
face staring at me out of the darkness within two feet of mine.
Instinctively I drew back my arm, in a way wondering who would get in
the first knock when I realised that my opponent was my own reflection
in the glass of the door, which led to the lower regions of the
fort.</p>

<p>We found the bore and vent all clear, with ramrod, sponge, and
extractor all complete. As the latter two could only be required in the
event of a second shot, they did not interest us. If we could ram home
and bring off the &ldquo;One Gun Salute&rdquo; as it was eventually
called, we were going to rest on our laurels. Having completed our
examination, we returned down the lightning conductor, into the scow,
and back to Cavill&rsquo;s Baths. That occupied one whole night, from
just before midnight until five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and not a
soul a penny the wiser.</p>

<p>We slowly collected powder, fuse, and masses of white cotton waste,
which we marled down, with the object of ramming home in the form of
three large wads, and so completing the charge. There were fourteen
pounds of blasting powder alone, apart from a similar amount of fine
grain, the former, of course, went in the rear of the charge, as it
burns slower;</p>

<p>What really topped off the crazy joke, and gave it a real artistic
finish, was the idea of hoisting the Boer colours on the flag staff of
the Fort.</p>

<p>England was then in the throes of the Boer War, with Australia more
loyal, more patriotic, more fervently keen for Empire rights, than was
even displayed at home. It is notorious that the Australians are always
more British than the English themselves, loyal to the heart&rsquo;s
core, and every thought for the homeland. The scene on the quaysides,
and in the towns when a contingent was leaving for South Africa, simply
staggered belief. The people were patriotic mad, and had there been the
ships and the necessity, every man jack in Australia would have
volunteered.</p>

<p>It was under these conditions that we conceived the glorious idea of
hoisting the Boer Flag and flaunting a real roaring red rag to the
Australian bull. It had, of course, to be made, and must not be made
out of bunting, otherwise it would at once be traced to some ship in
the harbour. Actually it was made out of linen pinched from the
surgery, and painted with the Boer colours. All this had to be done
behind locked doors, and after many days we were ready at last to put
our scheme to the test.</p>

<p>We had located a boat which we could commandeer, and at eleven
o&rsquo;clock one night, with a nice fine drizzle falling, sufficient
to keep most people in doors, we loaded up. I had the honour of
carrying the fifty feet of fuse round my waist, and the bag of powder
slung round my shoulder and under my armpits, covered by my coat. Three
huge wads of waste and the coil of signal halyards, for hauling the
ammunition up, were distributed equally between us.</p>

<p>With this, the three of us marched up George Street, Sydney,
perfectly confident that every policeman we came to was going to arrest
us on suspicion and trembling in our shoes in consequence; not so much
I&rsquo;ll say, in fear of ourselves, but that our plot might fail.</p>

<p>It did not.</p>

<p>We got our boat; then out to the fort, and up the lightning
conductor. Everything worked nicely to plan. Having hauled up the
powder, I laid on my back, and with my heels on the inside edge of the
Fort, I was just able to reach the muzzle of the gun, jam in the
flannel bag containing the power, and ram it well home. Next followed
the two wads of waste, and they also were rammed well home. Then,
finally, the third wad, which had first been soaked in water.</p>

<p>Our only disappointment so far had been that we were unable to train
the gun until it bore on a Russian man-o&rsquo;-war then lying in the
harbour. If this had been possible, we intended to insert one of the
sandstone balls from off the top of Government Garden Gates, which
would have burst on impact with her decks, and left little or no trace,
but added considerably to the fun. This did not come off, however, as
the gun couldn&rsquo;t be trained.</p>

<p>Having rammed the charge home, until the thud of the rammer was loud
enough to bring out the sentry, we quit. The plan was for the other two
boys to hoist the flag, let go the piece of signal halyard, that we had
used to haul up the ammunition, get down to the boat, turn her stern on
the rocks, haul the signal halyards into the boat, lay on their oars,
and stand by.</p>

<p>I had allowed three minutes for this operation.</p>

<p>In the meantime the fifty feet of fuse had to be coiled round the
breach of the gun; the pricker then driven down the vent to pierce the
flannel bag of powder, a small box of fine grain powder poured down the
touch-hole, the business end of the fuse stuck down the vent, and then
to stand by with a match. All this I finally finished, and there was
still one minute to wait; it seemed like an hour.</p>

<p>At last the great moment arrived. Striking the match, I lit the
frayed out end of the fuse, and, as it spluttered and hissed, blew out
the match, and put it into my mouth. The flag was now gaily fluttering
in the breeze, as I dashed for the lightning conductor, to find, in the
first place, that Watson had forgotten to let go one piece of signal
halyard. This I cast off; then I more fell than climbed down the slide
of the fort, on to the rocks below, only to discover that a plank in
the boat had been stove in on the rocks, by the wash from a passing
tug, and she was half full of water.</p>

<p>There was no choice; the fuse was burning, so we had to go. In we
jumped and pulled like mad. The others were both Conway boys, and they
could pull. I had to strip off my shirt and jam it into the hole, and
hold a foot on to it to keep the boat afloat at all.</p>

<p>It was impossible, in the circumstances, to return her. We had to
land, just at the nearest point, draw her up where she would be safe,
and scoot for our lives.</p>

<p>We went through the Domain, over the fourteen feet spiked gates of
Government Gardens, and across Government Gardens&mdash;where Watson
came to grief by putting his toe in one of the hoops round a rose bed,
turning a complete somersault, landing on his back in the middle of the
bed. We picked him up, and some of the more prominent thorns out, and
continued the race. As yet we had not stopped even to put on our
shoes.</p>

<p>We went over the gates on the far side of the gardens and on to
Circular quay. There we pulled up to take breath. They, of course,
wanted to know, &ldquo;was everything all right?&rdquo; &ldquo;Had the
fuse been lit?&rdquo; &ldquo;Would the gun go off?&rdquo; and so on. I
said I&rsquo;d done everything, but the only thing I had a doubt about
was that, in my excitement in driving the pricker down the vent hole, I
could not say for certain if it had pierced the flannel bag. If this
had not been done, I was afraid the main charge would not ignite, and,
of course, the gun would not go off. This was going to be a mighty
grievous disappointment; still, we consoled ourselves whilst putting on
our boots, with the thought that, at any rate, they would find the Boer
colours flying.</p>

<p>At this instant the whole sky lit up with a flash like lightning.
Each of us stopped in his tracks, and held his breath. Was it, or was
it not the gun? Surely not, with a huge flash like that. More likely
lightning.</p>

<p>We waited and waited.</p>

<p>Then it came, and no mistake indeed. There was a crash like thunder,
we could feel the concussion even where we stood.</p>

<p>We danced and shouted; threw down our caps and danced on them, and
even shook hands, and, in short, behaved like lunatics. <i>We&rsquo;d
done the trick.</i></p>

<p>We soon realised that it behoved us not to act like imbeciles, or we
should attract attention; so, very sedately and circumspectly, we made
out way back on board. The Quartermaster had been disposed of when
coming ashore by sending him on a wild goose chase to make some coffee,
and whilst he was away from the gangway we slipped ashore unseen.
Coming back, our luck was still in, and we each got to our cabins
without anyone being the wiser.</p>

<p>How we chuckled during the remainder of our stay in Sydney. The
noise, the uproar, the jeers and recriminations. Imagine the feelings
of the inhabitants when they found the colours of Britain&rsquo;s hated
enemy, fluttering in the breeze, and on the flagstaff of the
harbour&rsquo;s main fortification. Oh! It was great. The military
authorities tried to throw the responsibility on the naval authorities,
who retaliated by insisting the the Fort was a military garrison, and
not their responsibility at all.</p>

<p>Somehow they managed to keep the papers in the dark for a couple of
days, with the result that when the papers <i>did</i> get hold of it,
they pulled the official leg, until the authorities were jumping mad,
and would have cheerfully hung, drawn and quartered the culprits had
they caught them, but luckily for our hides, they never did.<br>
</p>

<h4>NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS</h4>

<p>WHAT HAPPENED AT FORT DENISON</p>

<p>A Strange Story</p>

<p>Who fired the gun?</p>

<p>The police are engaged in investigating a peculiar occurrence which
is reported to have taken place at Fort Denison the other morning. The
authorities are strangely reticent about the matter, but from what can
be gleaned, it would seem that either a big practical joke has been
played by someone, or else there are in our midst persons of a very
strong pro-Boer temperament. The police are busily engaged in looking
for an explanation.</p>

<p>Just as the Post Office clock had struck the hour of 1 a.m., a gun
went off at Fort Denison, breaking some of the windows and, the story
goes, putting the red light out. How it happened, nobody seems to know.
On the tower are several large guns of an obsolete pattern, and it is
one of these that is said to have gone off. Moreover, it has been
stated that in the morning, a flag with the Boer colours was found
flying on the tower. But, whilst this has not been positively denied,
an official communicated with last night said he &lsquo;never heard of
such a thing.&rsquo; At the same time he admitted having received a
similar report. A man was dispatched to examine the guns, with the
result that he reported that one of them had the appearance of having
just been fired. A direct question as to whether it had been fired met
with the answer. &lsquo;That remains to be proved.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the mystery continues and all sorts of stories, possible
and impossible, are going about. One is to the effect that a boatman
saw a man pull over to Pinchgut; and, making his boat fast, climb up
the tower. It was too dark to see what he was doing, and though he
watched him for some time, thinking his movements somewhat mysterious;
the boatman took no particular notice of the occurrence until he
suddenly heard a gun go off. A fuse is supposed to have been employed,
and it is also clear that the gunpowder was carried to the fort.</p>

<p>Colonel Roberts: Why, what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. Sleath: Was not the military called out?</p>

<p>Colonel Roberts: No; what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. Cook: What happened to Jones? It was what happened to the gun
this time.</p>

<p>Mr. Sleath: The gun went off.</p>

<p>Colonel Roberts: What is the joke?</p>

<p>Mr. Sleath: Are you not in a position to give any explanation:</p>

<p>Colonel Roberts: None whatever. When did this take place, and what
was it?</p>

<p>Mr. Sleath then read an extract from the press regarding the
reported firing of the gun at Fort Denison in the early morning.
Colonel Roberts said Fort Denison was not under his department, being
under the control of the naval authorities.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h3>

<h4>ALMOST A PENALTY</h4>

<p>It was not until I got home that the full measure of my iniquity was
brought home to me. It had leaked out on board, and though I hate to
say it, one of my own shipmates was mean enough to give me away to the
powers at 30 James Street, Liverpool. They, on their part, had no
choice but to sit up and take notice for it was reported under the
guise of &ldquo;endangering the Midshipmen&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo; That,
and one or two other things that had been done, which probably would
have been best left undone, although they were quite good sport in the
doing, finally caused me to realise the immediate necessity of writing
my resignation, before I was asked for it; and so nearly ended my brief
career in the White Star Line. Nearly, but not quite so.</p>

<p>The Marine Superintendent, dear old Daddy Hewitt&mdash;now long
since passed beyond&mdash;put me on the carpet, and gave me the
darndest dressing down I ever had in my life; but before making his
final decision, he insisted on my giving him full and complete details.
Thinking that as I had the order of the boot anyway, it was of little
consequence how I told it, or how he received it, I simply told it in
my own words, neither hiding nor elaborating anything. I suppose I
enthused a bit towards the end, for I noticed that he kept putting his
hand up and rubbing his old grey beard&mdash;not that I paid much
attention&mdash;until, just as I had finished, he went off into a roar
of laughter. My dejected spirits immediately shot up, and I thought,
&ldquo;Come, it isn&rsquo;t so bad if he can laugh,&rdquo; and in the
end it wasn&rsquo;t. He picked up my resignation which was lying in
front of him, tore it in half, and growled out, &ldquo;Get out of here,
and back on board your ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was taken out of the Australian Line as it was not thought
advisable for me to go back until things had simmered down a bit. As a
matter of fact, in effect, I got slight promotion, through being
transferred to the Atlantic, but before finishing with Australia I must
just give this example of the wonderful Australian hospitality we
experienced whilst in Sydney.</p>

<p>These boys and I had been across the harbour to Rosecutter&rsquo;s
Bay (sic), and had decided to have a ramble along the cliffside,
catching lizards, crabs, and so forth, when I suddenly realised that I
had left my good watch in the boat, and with one of the boys, who
volunteered to come with me, went off back. The other two went on,
Watson, of course, one of them. Roach and I sat there on the gunwhale
of the boat dangling our feet in the water, for half an hour or so,
when we suddenly heard hails and yells from Watson and Freke who
suddenly appeared bounding down the cliff with two men in pursuit.
Roach and I shoved the boat off, turned her round stern on, hoisted the
mainsail, and stood waiting, up to our knees in water. When the two men
saw this man&oelig;uvre, and that evidently these boys were from the
boat, they stopped. Watson and Freke tore across the beach and into the
water. We all tumbled on board and sheeted home.</p>

<p>They were in convulsions of laughter, and could hardly explain, when
I asked them with some annoyance, what on earth they had been up to. If
there was any possible mischief to be got into, trust Watson to be in
it. His story was that they were returning to the boat along the top of
a cliff, when they came to a fence that reached right to the edge. In
the fence was a gate. The only alternative to returning the way they
had come, was to open the gate and walk into what proved to be a
garden. They walked in, and the path led them up to a house. Around the
house was the invariable wide, sun screened veranda. On this veranda
was a tea table, tea already made and the table all set out with cakes,
fruit, and all the etceteras that appeal to the heart of a hungry boy.
With inconceivable cheek, Watson planted himself in a chair and invited
Freke to a cup of tea. Freke, although he should have known better, sat
down, and they both sailed in to a downright good tuck in. In the
middle of it, Watson, who was facing the hall of the house, noticed in
the shadows, a lady and two gentlemen, calmly standing watching the
whole proceeding. &ldquo;Cave!&rdquo; yelled Watson, and made his exit.
The two gentlemen, who proved to be father and son, came running out,
and called to them to stop. As Watson emphatically said, &ldquo;We were
not doing any stopping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;of course, you are for it this
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although they had only duck pants and soft shirts on, their badge
cap must have given them away. Anyway, they were the only midshipmen in
Sydney at that time, and I think everyone on board the <i>Medic</i> was
far too well-known for them not to have been spotted. I decided there
was only one thing to do, and that was to get back as soon as we could
next day and make full apologies, for although it might only be a joke,
played on the spur of the moment, if it got into cold print it would
look beastly. So next day back to the beach we went, and, in a weak
moment, I gave way to their entreaties that I should go up and make
peace for them.</p>

<p>I went up, and the lady of the house came to the door. I commenced
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to apologise for the outrageous behaviour of
those two young midshipmen yesterday.&rdquo; I got no further. Here you
have the true Australian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say a word about it,&rdquo; she said. I
<i>thought</i> those two boys were off the <i>Medic</i>. We thoroughly
enjoyed the joke. We called them to come back. We wanted them to join
us--but they wouldn&rsquo;t&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;they told me you had called them,
but, as they put it, &lsquo;they were not stopping.&rsquo; You see they
are not used to your Australian ways. In England such a thing would not
be looked upon in the light of a joke, by any means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing would satisfy her but that I should bring the boys up to the
house, and she would give them tea, right there and then. I could have
hugged her.</p>

<p>I went back to the boys, pulling a long face, and said that nothing
but their personal attendance and an abject apology would meet the
case. &ldquo;Come on, now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and take your
medicine.&rdquo; They came, a most dejected looking pair. And their
blank amazement was really well worth seeing, when Mrs. Penrose, the
dear old motherly soul, almost threw her arms around them. She gave
them all they could eat, and far more than was good for them. From that
hour, her place was open house to every officer and midshipman on
board, particularly the midshipmen. Parties and picnics, afloat and
ashore, during the remainder of the time we were in Sydney, and very
loth they were to leave it.</p>

<p>Poor old Watson!</p>

<p>When in Cape Town, we both tried to join the S.A. Light Horse. We
couldn&rsquo;t get a scrap of help, and unless we left the ship, they
would not look at us. We tried all we knew how, to get the Powers to
use their influence with the White Star Line, to sign us off, but there
was nothing doing, and as I couldn&rsquo;t afford to burn my boats, we
went home. Having got home, the glamour of war, to me, had faded to a
certain extent, and in any case, I realised I had got to stick at sea,
and stick to the company, if I was going to do any good at all. Watson
was younger and went back&mdash;and he stayed there. Shot in action on
the Tugela River.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h3>

<h4>GREYHOUNDS OF THE ATLANTIC</h4>

<p>With the exception of one other voyage to Australia, which, as a
matter of fact, although promotion at the time, was actually a
punishment voyage, for a certain scrape I got into, the whole of my
twenty years with the White Star Line, was spent on the Atlantic
service: fifteen in the mail boats, and if ever there was a kill or
cure, it was a Western Ocean mail boat in winter time.</p>

<p>In those days, although the ships were much smaller, everything was
devoted to making a passage, with the result that the ship was driven
smashing through everything and anything in the way of weather, pretty
well regardless of damage done. Those ships were stronger in proportion
than the mammoths of today.</p>

<p>I have seen a big modern liner push a plate in, where the old time
ship would have just bumped and bounced off without a scrap of damage.
Three times in the old <i>Majestic</i> I have seen the look-out cage,
situated half way up the fore-lowermast, and built of steel, flattened
in against the mast, but little or no damage on deck.</p>

<p>The officers&rsquo; quarters were situated on the fore deck, and
formed a kind of breakwater to the saloon. Immense nets were spread
from the fore part of our quarters to the after part of the
fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle to break up the seas as they came thundering on
board. The ports with their inch-thick glass, were protected in bad
weather with thick oak shutters with small two-inch bulls-eyes let into
them. Notwithstanding these precautions, one afternoon, for instance,
we shipped a sea, or, to be more correct, we drove into and under a
sea, that dropped on top of us; and the first thing it touched was the
nets. These it tore to pieces, and struck the fore part of our place
with such force that although built of steel, and of immense strength,
the fore part was completely bent in. The glass bull&rsquo;s eye was
driven through the inner port, and a piece of this glass actually took
a cup out of the hand of an officer sitting at the table having
afternoon tea, leaving the handle in his hand. Any meal in those
circumstances, was a series of gymnastics, and although not amusing at
the time, very often became the subject of an interesting yarn when
swapping lies with kindred spirits, later on.</p>

<p>On one occasion a huge roast of beef was planted on the Second
Officer&rsquo;s pillow. He was on the bridge at the time, and although
immensely fond of a practical joke at other people&rsquo;s expense,
could never bear to have one played on himself; but this one was on him
all right. The roast of beef was on one end of the mess room table
which ran athwartships, and it was the custom, in this ship only, for
the First Officer to carve. The boat gave one of her terrific lurches,
which, when accompanied by the propeller coming out of the water,
engenders a sensation immeasurably worse than an express lift dropping
from the upper floors of a skyscraper.</p>

<p>The First must have thought the Chief was going to check the beef.
One did not, neither did the other, with the result that it came
careering across the table, and having got a good start, each officer
cheered it on its way. At the far end of the table the dish was brought
up with a jerk by striking the fiddle, or wooden stretcher that is
placed there to keep the cutlery and plates with bounds. The edge of
the dish had just sufficient lip to give the roast an upward trend,
and, although there were two bunks, one above the other, and over ten
feet of space, the roast described a graceful parabola through the air,
across the rest of the messroom, through Barber&rsquo;s cabin, and came
to rest on his pillow. The mess room steward at once set out to
retrieve it, but we unanimously agreed that it was in far too good a
place to be disturbed.</p>

<p>Barber had a habit of coming off the bridge and asking the steward
what the others had had for their meal, as, of course, in these ships,
there is a pretty long menu. We had coached the steward, before we had
retired to our cabins and when Barber had made his usual enquiry,
&ldquo;Well, Davies, what have you got,&rdquo; followed by, &ldquo;What
have the others had? Oh, all right, I&rsquo;ll have the roast beef
too,&rdquo; Davies replied, &ldquo;The roast beef is in your bunk,
sir.&rdquo; At first, Barber didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it,
then, when he did realize this, as the song goes, &ldquo;The air went
blue for miles all round,&rdquo; and to this day he firmly believes it
was put there. When you take into consideration that the edge of the
bunk was five feet from the deck, and ten feet from the edge of the
table, it certainly did seem pretty near an impossibility, but at the
same time, it wall give a fairly clear idea of the contortions of a
Western Ocean mail boat in an Atlantic gale.</p>

<p>These ships are not only the cream of the service, but the cream of
the Mercantile Marine, and it is considered a feather in one&rsquo;s
cap to be appointed to one. Therefore, despite the rigorous conditions,
and the powers of endurance one has to exhibit, there is never a word
of complaint. Time and again I have seen a ship driven into a huge
green wall of water, crowned with that wicked, curling breaker, which
it seemed utterly impossible for anything to withstand. An immediate
dash is made for an iron stanchion, and, gripping this with might and
main, one awaits the crash. Not infrequently the steel fronted bridge,
stanchions and rail are driven back, and nearly flattened to the
deck&mdash;to the discomfort of the O.O.W.</p>

<p>It certainly was not a paying game, although the Mail Boat companies
were slow to discover it. As ships grew bigger and faster, and did more
damage in consequence, Captains were warned to be more circumspect,
and, when the occasion demanded, to slow down.</p>

<p>The bigger the ship, the longer she could be driven before she would
take any weighty water on board, but when she did, then it was
proportionately heavier. But the increased strength of the liner by no
means kept pace with the increased volume of water she could, and would
ship.</p>

<p>Then again, there is the increased speed of these vessels, and , of
course, the seas have attained an increased speed by the time one does
get its head up and come aboard, the cumulative effect is sometimes
astonishing, and not infrequently, disastrous. In a word, we cannot
drive the ships to-day like we used to, even if we would; just because
their strength has not, and in point of fact, could not, increase with
their size. The temptation to drive is there, but if she is not eased
down, something will happen, as happened to one of our biggest and best
ships, the <i>Olympic</i>.</p>

<p>She had a steel hatch on the forecastle, weighing about three tons.
This was built with a turtle back, and comparatively close down to the
deck, so as to give a sea, when it did come, the very least chance to
get a grip. It was secured all round, inside and underneath by one and
an eighth inch bolts, fifteen inches apart, each bolt individually
screwed hard down before leaving port. Would you think it possible to
lift it? Yet, she had such a hatch ripped off like a piece of paper and
flung down the fore well deck.</p>

<p>Wicked though a Western Ocean gale can be, fog still remains a
sailor&rsquo;s worst enemy, and this applies more so when he is in the
region of ice than anywhere. For this reason the steamship lanes are
altered to clear the Grand Banks altogether when ice is around.</p>

<p>Apart from the ice and fog, an added anxiety when crossing these
banks is the cod fishermen, who put out from Newfoundland, and many
other ports in the United States. One whole fleet comes over from
France, mainly F&eacute;camp.</p>

<p>A blanket of fog will suddenly shut down, with not only these
vessels scattered about, but also their dories, small light skiffs, of
which a large schooner will carry perhaps fifteen to twenty. The dories
have no means whatever of indicating their presence to an oncoming
ship; in fact, the schooners are not really very much better off,
particularly when one takes into consideration the utter unreliability
of sound in fog.</p>

<p>The Atlantic Mail Boats have been unfairly blamed for the loss of a
great number of these schooners, whereas, knowing, as we do, the
difficulties under which the fishing is carried out, every possible
precaution and care is taken to avoid a collision. Two look-out men are
always on their stations. In fog, these are always doubled, as also is
the look-out on the bridge. The ship is slowed down, and an automatic
steam whistle blows every minute. It has never been my misfortune to
run of these poor devils down, although, heaven knows, I have been
close enough to them. A slight loom ahead, helm hard over, and gliding
by within biscuit throw, goes a big topsail schooner. A quiet exchange
of glances on the bridge, a sort of general sigh at the escape, and
everyone again freezes into immobility, and intense
concentration&mdash;watching and listening.</p>

<p>The risks the individual fishermen take are not only confined to
laying across the steamship lanes. They&rsquo;ll face almost any
weather, and almost always freezing at that. I have seen dories out and
fishing in weather one would have thought it impossible for a small
open boat to live in. Up round the Virgin Rocks, where the water breaks
in a heavy sea, it is a common custom in an increasing gale for these
small boats to hang on and hang on, each man daring the other. This is
one of the best fishing grounds, and the boats lie-to at anchor. The
sea steadily rises, banks up, and eventually breaks. Many is the dory
that has been lost here through sheer daredevil hanging on. See a
couple of them riding at the sea when it has become an absolute wall.
With a careful manipulation of the warp, they run their boat up the
precipitous side of the sea, give a sharp snub on the rope, and she is
over the top just as the crest is about to break. One by one the boats
will slip and run, as the seas get too big for them and threaten to
break. But there are one or two foolhardy ones that will strive for the
honour of being the last to the leave, and not infrequently they are
the last&mdash;the long, long, last. A slight misjudgment of the curl
of the crest, maybe the anchor drags just as he goes to snub her over
the top, or perhaps the rope itself breaks. Then the flimsy dory is
picked up on that wall of water, flung in the air, and finally crushed
to matchwood&mdash;another victim of the Virgins.</p>

<p>I got my severest mail boat training during the seven hard, though
happy years I spent in the Queen of the Seas, as the <i>Oceanic</i> was
then called. A wonderful ship, built in a class of her own, and by
herself.</p>

<p>The usual custom is to build twin ships, as with the
<i>Britannic</i> and <i>Germanic</i>, <i>Teutonic</i> and
<i>Majestic</i>. Then, in lone and stately majesty came the
<i>Oceanic</i>. She was an experiment, and a wonderfully successful
one; built by Harland and Wolff, regardless of cost, elaborate to a
degree, money lavished where it was necessary, but never gaudily as is
so common nowadays. Her smoke room doors were a masterpiece in
themselves, and cost &pound;500. There was eighteen carat gold plating
on the electric light fittings throughout the saloon and staircase, and
paintings by well-known artists, worth a cool thousand apiece. Hand
carvings of delicate work, and the joy of souvenir hunters. Every deck
plank was picked wood. Last, but by no means least, her Captain, John
G. Cameron. A martinet to his fingertips, who set a standard, that I,
for one, found it difficult to live up to. He was deep voiced and
bluff, but a splendid seaman, and proud of his ship. With his blue eyes
and ginger beard he was a broad shouldered edition of Captain Kettle.
Head erect and shoulders back, he would walk out on the bridge, and
fire off a volley of questions, and woe betide the unfortunate officer
that hadn&rsquo;t an answer ready. Not to be able to answer each, and
every one, as quickly as they were shot at you, in his deep staccato
tones, was to invite the brief but pungent query, &ldquo;Then what the
hell are you here for?&rdquo; To give any back chat or even look what
you felt would not only put a term to your services in that ship, but
probably ruin your prospects in the Line. Yet to be appointed to her
was the most signal compliment. Of course, we all knew the questions he
was most likely to ask, and had answers ready. They usually ran:
&ldquo;What are the revolutions?&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on the log
at eight bells?&rdquo; &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the barometer?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the wind?&rdquo; &ldquo;What time does the moon
rise?&rdquo; This latter was not an easy one to answer correctly, and
meant a lot of figuring out. As a rule, a broad guess was near enough,
for John G. didn&rsquo;t always bear your replies in mind. One officer,
six feet three inches, and misnamed &ldquo;Little,&rdquo; well liked
throughout the Line, and not least by John G., was saluted one evening
with the usual rattle of questions, the last one being, &ldquo;What
time does the moon rise?&rdquo; to which Little replied,
&ldquo;Eleven-fifteen, sir.&rdquo; It then being seven-thirty
o&rsquo;clock and Cameron in full mess kit on his way down to dinner.
With that Cameron turned smartly round and left the bridge, but as he
was going down the ladder to the promenade deck, behold a cloud rolled
away, leaving a full moon high up in the sky. Cameron saw it, and, for
a wonder remembered what Little had said, so when he returned to the
bridge after dinner, with his cigar a-cock-bill, his first question was
in a particular &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got you, my lad&rdquo; tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You told me the moon rose at eleven fifteen, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little, not to be caught out, replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, sir, I got hold of last year&rsquo;s
calendar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did, did you? Bring it here and let me see it,&rdquo;
said Cameron, with a suspicious squint out of the corner of his eye.
Little immediately replied, in a tone of deep respect:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I threw it overboard sir, so that no one else should make the
same mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cameron looked straight at him and then turned on his heel with an
irrepressible chuckle, and the slow, but pungent remark, &ldquo;You
damned liar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He never minced matters in his remarks to his officers, although
heaven help the man who took them literally.</p>

<p>The <i>Oceanic&rsquo;s</i> bridge was covered with expensive white
rubber, laid in narrow strips, representing planks. This had to be
scrubbed every morning with bath brick, until it was snow white.
Incidentally if it was not scrubbed and got salt water on in, it became
so abominably slippery that we had to lay down coir matting to walk on.
She had a bow fronted wheel house, and covered in bridge amidships.
After a shower I used to amuse myself, when she had got a slight roll
on, by trying to slide from one side of the bridge to the other,
without touching anything. It was rather difficult to negotiate the
forward bulge of the wheel house, steering between this and the wheel
on the bridge. With much practice I became so proficient that four out
of five times I would make the passage without touching. One morning,
after several ineffectual attempts, I at last came across in one
beautiful sweep, shooting both wheel house and wheel, when, to my
horror, on the opposite side, out stepped John G. Cameron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what the hell do you think <i>you&rsquo;re</i> doing,
sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, sir. I
slipped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slipped, did you? I wish you had broken your damned neck,
sir, as you nearly broke mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that the incident was closed.</p>

<p>No passengers were allowed on the boat deck, so all these episodes
were kept a jealous secret. No doubt we were looked upon as models of
rectitude and correct behaviour&mdash;or at least what they could see
of us above the dodger. On the bridge, with rare exceptions, no doubt
we were, but it was a different tale when we got below&mdash;that is,
to our own quarters.</p>

<p>Then the fun started, particularly at four o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon, when my watch ended and afternoon tea was served. It was
usual for almost everyone off watch to have a caulk after
lunch&mdash;sort of fortification for the night watches&mdash;when
there&rsquo;s NO fooling. Unless a chap was off colour, and pinned a
notice on his cabin begging that he might not be disturbed, he had to
come out of his own free will or be brought out, usually by inserting a
lighted blue light (which gives off a terrific amount of pungent smoke)
in a copper fire nozzle to the ventilator at the bottom of his door. On
one such occasion, the deck steward had to make a hurried visit so that
he could assure some passengers that the ship was not really on
fire.</p>

<p>From Second Officer of the <i>Oceanic</i> to First of the
<i>Majestic</i>, then temporary Chief of the <i>Majestic</i> and back
again to First of the <i>Oceanic</i>, such were the moves covering the
next couple of years.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER THIRTY</h3>

<h4>LOSS OF THE &ldquo;TITANIC&rdquo;</h4>

<p>From the <i>Oceanic</i> as First, I was appointed to the
<i>Titanic</i> of tragic memory, as First, and three very contented
chaps took the midnight boat for Belfast, where she was completing.
Murdoch, Chief, your humble, First, and Davy Blair, Second; Captain
E.J. Smith, Commodore of the Line came over a little later on. Captain
Smith, or &ldquo;E.J.&rdquo; as he was familiarly and affectionately
known, was quite a character in the shipping world. Tall, full
whiskered and broad. At first sight you would think to yourself
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a typical Western Ocean Captain.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bluff, hearty, and I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s got a voice like a
foghorn.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, he had a pleasant quiet voice and
invariable smile. A voice he rarely raised above a conversational
tone&mdash;not to say he couldn&rsquo;t; in fact, I have often heard
him bark an order that made a man come to himself with a bump. He was a
great favourite, and a man any officer would give his ears to sail
under. I had been with him many years, off and on, in the mail boats,
<i>Majestic</i>, mainly, and it was an education to see him con his own
ship up through the intricate channels entering New York at full speed.
One particularly bad corner, known as the South-West Spit, used to make
us fairly flush with pride as he swung her round, judging his distances
to a nicety; she heeling over to the helm with only a matter of feet to
spare between each end of the ship and the banks.</p>

<p>For some time previous to being appointed to the <i>Titanic</i>
&ldquo;E.J.&rdquo; had been command of the <i>Olympic</i>&mdash;since
she was launched in fact. Murdoch also came from the <i>Olympic</i>,
whilst Blair and I were from the <i>Oceanic</i>.</p>

<p>It is difficult to convey any idea of the size of a ship like the
<i>Titanic</i>, when you could actually walk miles along decks and
passages, covering different ground all the time. I was thoroughly
familiar with pretty well every type of ship afloat, from a battleship
and a barge, but it took me fourteen days before I could with
confidence find my way from one part of that ship to another by the
shortest route. As an instance of size, there was a huge gangway door
through which you could drive a horse and cart on the starboard side
aft. Three other officers, joining later, tried for a whole day to find
it. No doubt with the help of a plan, it would have been fairly simple,
but a sailor does not walk round with a plan in his pocket, he must
carry his ship in his head, and in an emergency such as fire must be
able to get where he wants by sheer instinct&mdash;certainly without a
chance of getting lost on the way.</p>

<p>Touching on fire, the modern ship&rsquo;s equipment is such that it
is almost impossible, with fair play, for a fire to get a serious hold.
I say this, despite the fact that quite recently no less than three
modern liners have been burned out. Generally speaking, the
fire-fighting equipment is based on something like these lines. Close
adjacent to the bridge is the Master Fire Station, where a Fireman in
full regalia is on duty night and day, and must never be more than six
feet away from the door of his station. In his little cubby hole, he is
surrounded with instruments which keep him in close touch with
secondary Fire Stations situated in commanding positions throughout the
ship. In front of him, in the Master Station, on the bulk-head, is a
glass fronted air tight case, into which are leading numbers of little
tubes, coming direct from the Secondary Fire Stations. By suction a
current of air is drawn through these tubes and into the case. As the
air comes through the tube it impinges on a filament resembling
tinfoil, causing this to vibrate, and therefore proves that a current
of air is actually passing through. If the other end of this tube
should be blocked, or stuffed up by some unconscious humorist, this
filament at once becomes stationary.</p>

<p>Now if anyone were to stand close to the other end of the tube, say
smoking a cigarette, the smoke would be drawn into the tube, passed up
to the Fire Station, and strike this filament. The smoke would then
become exaggerated until it resembled a ball of wool, and would
immediately catch the notice of the man on duty. If he wishes he can
ascertain for his own satisfaction whether it is just tobacco smoke, or
something more dangerous. Probably if he finds it is merely tobacco
smoke he will conclude that someone is standing nearby the tube
smoking, and may wait a reasonable time for it to disappear. If he is
not satisfied he will telephone down, calling that Station; and, the
man on duty replying, he will ask, more or less politely, if anyone is
smoking near that detector: Probably the man on the Secondary Station
will find that it is just tobacco smoke and report it. If, on the other
hand, it were, for instance, the result of some careless fool throwing
a cigarette down on the carpet, and setting it alight, very few moments
would elapse before it was known on the bridge, and communication made
to the necessary points</p>

<p>Hoses are always ready, rigged in readiness and attached to
hydrants, so that even in the case of a really serious fire suddenly
breaking out, it would be known at headquarters within a very few
seconds, &ldquo;fire stations&rdquo; signalled, and A Fire Party with
hoses buckets and blankets would be on the spot within three
minutes.</p>

<p>In these circumstances it is extremely difficult to arrive at any
satisfactory conclusion as to how, with fair play, a fire could break
out on a modern ship, like say the <i>Atlantique</i> without being
instantly detected. Admitted there were no passengers on board, yet the
ordinary fire precautions would still be in operation. With the
<i>Europa</i> it was different; she was still in the builders&rsquo;
hands, but judging by what one knows of builders, the fire precautions
are just as stringent whilst the ship is being built as they are when
she goes to sea; in British shipyards, anyhow, and I don&rsquo;t
suppose the Germans are a whit behind us.</p>

<p>But to return to the <i>Titanic</i>. Putting a new ship in
commission is, at the best of times, a pretty strenuous job. With the
<i>Titanic</i>, it was night and day work, organizing here, receiving
stores there, arranging duties, trying and testing out the different
contrivances, makers of the hundred and one instruments with their
chits to be signed certifying that this, that, and the other was in
perfect working order. All the navigation instruments fell to my lot,
as also did firearms and ammunition.</p>

<p>These latter are looked on mostly as ornaments in the modern
ship.</p>

<p>Revolvers, rifles and bayonets in the Merchant Service, are rather
superfluous. A man governs by accepted discipline, tact, his own
personality, and good common sense. We have no King&rsquo;s Regulations
to back us up; neither do we need them; nor yet do we require firearms,
except on the rarest occasions. Curiously enough, the <i>Titanic</i>
was to prove the only occasion at sea that I have ever seen firearms
handed out, and even then it was not Britishers they were used to
influence.</p>

<p>After running our trials we finally took over from the builders and
proceeded round to Southampton. It was clear to everybody on board that
we had a ship that was going to create the greatest stir British
shipping circles had ever known. For one thing she was the first ship
to be fitted with a third screw, driven by a low-powered turbine. For
man&oelig;uvering, the two wing screws alone were used, but once clear
of the land, steam from low pressure cylinders was turned into this
turbine, and undoubtedly gave her a wonderful turn of speed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, whilst in Southampton, we had a re-shuffle amongst
the Senior Officers. Owing to the <i>Olympic</i> being laid up, the
ruling lights of the White Star Line thought it would be a good plan to
send the Chief Officer of the <i>Olympic</i>, just for the one voyage,
as Chief Officer of the <i>Titanic</i>, to help, with his experience of
her sister ship. This doubtful policy threw both Murdoch and me out of
our stride; and, apart from the disappointment of having to step back
in our rank, caused quite a little confusion. Murdoch, from Chief, took
over my duties as First, I stepped back on Blair&rsquo;s toes as
Second, and picked up the many threads of his job, whilst he,--luckily
for him as it turned out&mdash;was left behind. The other officers
remained the same. However, a couple of days in Southampton saw each of
us settled in our new positions and familiar with our duties. Board of
Trade surveys were carried out to everyone&rsquo;s satisfaction. Life
boats and all life-saving equipment tested, exercised and passed.
&ldquo;Fireworks&rdquo; (distress rockets, distress signals, blue
lights, etc.) examined, tried and approved. All these and a hundred and
one other details pertaining to a crack Atlantic Liner preparing for
sea were gone through. Being a new ship, and the biggest in the world,
even more scrupulous care was exercised than is usual, or applies to a
ship on her settled run. The Board of Trade Surveyor, Captain Clark,
certainly lived up to his reputation as being the best cursed B.O.T.
representative in the South of England at that time. Many small
details, that another surveyor would have taken in his stride accepting
the statement of the officer concerned was not good enough for Clark.
He must see everything, and himself check every item that concerned the
survey. He would not accept anyone&rsquo;s word as sufficient&mdash;and
got heartily cursed in consequence. He did his job, and I&rsquo;ll
certainly say he did it thoroughly.</p>

<p>At last sailing day arrived, and from end to end the ship, which for
days had been like a nest of bees, now resembled a hive about to
swarm.</p>

<p>As &ldquo;zero&rdquo; hour drew near, so order could be seen
arriving out of chaos. On the stroke of the hour the gangway was
lowered, the whistle blew, ropes were let go, and the tugs took the
strain.</p>

<p>She was away.<br>
</p>

<hr><a name="ch31"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h3>

<h4>LEAVING SOUTHAMPTON</h4>

<p>Before she cleared the dock we had a striking example of the power
that lay in those engines and propellers.</p>

<p>The <i>Oceanic</i> and <i>St. Paul</i> (sic) were lying moored to
the wharf alongside each other. They happened to be in a position where
the <i>Titanic</i> had to make a slight turn, which necessitated coming
astern on her port engine. The terrific suction set up in that shallow
water simply dragged both these great liners away from the wharf. The
<i>St. Paul</i> broke adrift altogether, and the <i>Oceanic</i> was
dragged off until a sixty foot gangway dropped from the wharf into the
water. It looked as if nothing could save the <i>St. Paul</i> crashing
into the <i>Titanic</i>&rsquo;s stern&mdash;in fact, it was only
Captain Smith&rsquo;s experience and resource that saved her. The
<i>Titanic</i>, of course, dwarfed these two ships, and made them look
like cross-channel boats, and the wash from her screws had a
corresponding influence. Just as a collision seemed inevitable, Captain
Smith gave the <i>Titanic</i> a touch ahead on her port engine, which
simply washed the <i>St. Paul</i> away, and kept her clear until a
couple of tugs, to our unbounded relief, got hold, and took her back
alongside the wharf.</p>

<p>To the casual observer the whole incident would have been just a
thrill&mdash;perhaps not much more even though there had been a
collision. For us it would have been something much deeper. It is
difficult to describe just exactly where that unity of feeling lies,
between a ship and her crew, but it is surely there, in every ship that
sails salt water. It is not always a feeling of affection either. A man
can hate a ship worse than he can a human being, although he sails on
her. Likewise a ship can hate her men, then she frequently becomes
known as a &ldquo;killer,&rdquo; and in the days of sail, would
regularly kill a man voyage after voyage.</p>

<p>The greatest care had to be taken whilst threading our way down the
then comparatively shallow channel of Southampton Water and eventually
out to Spithead. There was a general feeling of relief when at last we
got her into her proper element, deep water.</p>

<p>We then went across to Cherbourg&mdash;a short run which barely
warmed her up. Then a longer leg to Queenstown, and finally, the
following day, we opened her up on the long run to New York.</p>

<p>Each day, as the voyage went on, everybody&rsquo;s admiration of the
ship increased; for the way she behaved, for the total absence of
vibration, for her steadiness even with the ever-increasing speed, as
she warmed up to her work.</p>

<p>As day followed day, officers and men settled down into the collar,
and duty linked up with duty until the watches went by without pause or
hitch. We were not out to make a record passage; in fact the White Star
Line invariably run their ships at reduced speed for the first few
voyages. It tells in the long run, for the engines of a ship are very
little different from the engines of a good car, they must be run in.
Take the case of the <i>Oceanic</i>. She steadily increased her speed
from 19 1/2knots to 21 &frac12; when she was twelve years old. It has
often been said that had not the <i>Titanic</i> been trying to make a
passage, the catastrophe would never have occurred.</p>

<p>Nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>She was certainly making good speed that night of April 14th, but
not her best&mdash;nothing compared with what she would have been
capable, in say a couple of years&rsquo; time. The disaster was just
due to a combination of circumstances that never occurred before and
can never occur again. That may sound like a sweeping statement, yet it
is a fact.</p>

<p>All during that fatal day the sea had been like glass&mdash;an
unusual occurrence for that time of the year&mdash;not that that caused
any great worry. Again, there had been an extremely mild winter in the
Arctic, owing to which, ice from the ice cap and glaciers had broken
away in phenomenal quantities, and official reports say that never
before or since has there been known to be such quantities of icebergs,
growler, field ice and float ice, stretching down with the Labrador
current. In my fifteen years&rsquo; experience on the Atlantic I had
certainly never seen anything like it&mdash;not even in the South
Atlantic when, in the old days of sailing ships, we used to sometimes
go down to 65&ordm; south.</p>

<p>These were just some contributory causes that combined and brought
into existence, conditions of which the officers of the ship were to a
great extent ignorant.</p>

<p>Wireless reports were coming in through the day from various ships,
of ice being sighted in different positions. Nor was that anything
unusual at this time of the year, and none of the reports indicated the
extent of the ice seen. A report would read &ldquo;iceberg (or
icebergs) sighted in such and such a latitude and longitude.&rdquo;
Later on in the day we did get reports of ice sighted in larger
quantities, and also two reports of field ice, but they were in
positions that did not affect us. The one vital report that came
through but which never reached the bridge, was received at 9-40 p.m.
from the <i>Mesaba</i> stating &ldquo;Ice report in Latitude 42N to
41-25N. Long. 49 to Long. 50-30 W. Saw much heavy pack ice, and great
number large icebergs. Also field ice. Weather good, clear. Phillips,
the wireless operator on watch who received the message was not to know
the extreme urgency of the warning or hat we were at the time actually
entering the area given by the <i>Mesaba</i>, and are literally packed
with icebergs, field ice and growlers. He was very busy working
wireless messages to and from Cape Race, also with his accounts. The
junior operator, Bride, of course, knew noting about this vital
warning, being off duty, and turned-in. Later, when standing with
others on the upturned boat, Phillips explained when I said that I did
not recollect any <i>Mesaba</i> report: &ldquo;I just put the message
under a paper weight at my elbow, just until I squared up what I was
doing before sending it to the Bridge.&rdquo; <i>That delay proved
fatal and was the main contributory cause to the loss of that
magnificent ship and hundreds of lives</i>. Had I as Officer of the
Watch, or the Captain, become aware of the peril lying so close ahead
and not instantly slowed down or stopped, we should have been guilty of
culpable and criminal negligence.</p>

<p>For the last hour of my watch on that never-to-be-forgotten night I
had taken up a stationary position on the bridge, where I had an
unobstructed view right ahead, and perhaps a couple of points on either
bow. That did not signify that I was <i>expecting</i> to see ice, but
that there was the <i>possibility</i> of seeing ice, as there always is
when crossing The Banks; ice <i>may</i> be sighted. In point of fact,
under normal conditions, we should have probed to be well south of the
usual ice limit; only in this case the ice limit had moved very many
miles south, due solely to the immense amount of ice released in the
Arctic.</p>

<p>In ordinary circumstances the cold current carrying the icebergs
south, strikes the warm current flowing to the north-east and
under-runs in&mdash;that is to say the cold current goes under the warm
current, on the same principle that warm water always rises. The effect
of this is to melt the iceberg around the water line. It soon
&ldquo;calves&rdquo; or breaks up into smaller pieces, which again
break up, continuing to float in the warm surface current for a short
time, until completely melted. And so the work of disintegration goes
on in an ever increasing ratio, thereby forming the &ldquo;ice
limit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is often said you can tell when you are approaching ice, by the
drop in temperature. The answer to that is, open a refrigerator door
when the outside temperature is down, and see how close you have to get
before you detect a difference. No, you would have to be uncomfortably
close to &ldquo;smell&rdquo; ice that way.</p>

<p>Ten p.m. came and with it the change of the officers&rsquo; Watches.
On the bridge, after checking over such things as position, speed and
so forth, the officers coming on deck usually have a few minutes chat
with their opposite number, before officially taking over. The Senior
Officer, coming on Watch, hunts up his man in the pitch darkness, and
just yarns for a few minutes, whilst getting his eyesight after being
in the light&rsquo;when he can see all right he lets the other chap
know and officially &ldquo;takes over.&rdquo; Murdoch and I were old
shipmates and for a few minutes&mdash;as was our custom&mdash;we stood
there looking ahead, and yarning over times and incidents part and
present. We both remarked on the ship&rsquo;s steadiness, absence of
vibration, and how comfortably she was slipping along. Then we passed
on to more serious subjects, such as the chances of sighting ice,
reports of ice that had been sighted, and the positions. We also
commented on the lack of definition between the horizon and the
sky&mdash;which would make an iceberg all the more difficult to
see&mdash;particularly if it had a black side, and that should be, by
bad luck, turned our way.</p>

<p>The side of an iceberg that has calved or broken away from its
parent glacier will usually be black, where the fresh ice is showing,
and is consequently more difficult to see at night. After considerable
exposure, this side turns white like the rest.</p>

<p>We were then making an easy 22 knots. It was pitch dark and dead
cold. Not a cloud in the sky, and the sea like glass. The very
smoothness of the sea was, again, another unfortunate circumstance that
went to complete the chain.</p>

<p>If there had been either wind or swell, the outline of the berg
would have been rendered visible, through the water breaking at the
base.</p>

<p>Captain E.J. was one of the ablest Skippers on the Atlantic, and
accusations of recklessness, carelessness, not taking due precautions,
or driving his ship at too high a speed, were absolutely, and utterly
unfounded; but the armchair complaint is a very common disease, and
generally accepted as one of the necessary evils from which the
sea-farer is condemned to suffer. A dark night, a blinding squall, and
a man who has been on the mental rack for perhaps the last forty-eight
hours, is called on to make an instantaneous decision embodying the
safety of his crew and his ship. If he chooses the right course, as
nine times out of ten he does, all well and good, but if on the tenth
time his judgment is, momentarily, in error, then he may be certain he
is coming under the thumb of the armchair judge, who, a thousand to
one, has never been called on to make a life and death decision in a
sudden emergency.</p>

<p>Captain Smith, with every other senior officer (apart from myself),
went down, and was lost with the ship, and so escaped that never to be
forgotten ordeal carried out in Washington; repeated again in England,
and finally concluded in the Law Courts.</p>

<p>Murdoch, the First Officer, took over from me in the ordinary way. I
passed on the &ldquo;items of interest&rdquo; as we called them,
course, speed, weather conditions, ice reports, wished him joy of his
Watch, and went below. But first of all I had to do the rounds, and in
a ship of that size it meant a mile or more of deck, not including a
few hundred feet of ladders, staircases, etc.</p>

<p>Being a new ship it was all the more necessary to see that everyone
was on the top line. I had been right fore and aft several decks, along
a passage known as Park Lane, leading through the bowels of the ship on
one side, and bringing me out by a short cut to the after deck. Here I
had to look round to see that the Quartermaster and others were on
their stations, and then back to my warm cabin.</p>

<p>The temperature on deck felt somewhere around the zero of Canada,
although actually, it wasn&rsquo;t much below freezing, and I quickly
rolled into my blankets. There I lay, turning over my past sins and
future punishments, waiting until I could thaw and get to sleep.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h3>

<h4>COLLISION WITH AN ICEBERG</h4>

<p>I was just about ready for the land of nod, when I felt a sudden
vibrating jar run through the ship. Up to this moment she had been
steaming with such a pronounced lack of vibration that this sudden
break in the steady running was all the more noticeable. Not that it
was by any means a violent concussion, but just a distinct and
unpleasant break in the monotony of her motion.</p>

<p>I instantly leapt out of my bunk and ran out on deck in my pyjamas;
peered over the port side, but could see nothing there; ran across to
the starboard side, but neither was there anything there, and as the
cold was cutting like a knife, I hopped back into my bunk.</p>

<p>In any case, to go dashing up to the Bridge in night rig, or even
properly clothed, when not on duty, was bound to ensure anything but a
hearty welcome. Another thing, to be elsewhere than were you are
expected to be found, in a ship like that, would result in the man who
is sent to call you, being utterly unable to find you. So I just
waited.</p>

<p>The time we struck was 12:00 p.m., April 14th of tragic memory, and
it was about ten minutes later that the Fourth Officer, Boxall (sic)
opened my door, and , seeing me awake, quietly said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
hit an iceberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve hit something.&rdquo; He then
said, &ldquo;The water is up to F Deck in the Mail Room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was quite sufficient. Not another word passed. He went out,
closing the door, whilst I slipped into some clothes as quickly as
possible, and went out on deck.</p>

<p>The decks in a modern liner are lettered from the boat deck
downwards, A,B,C,D,E, and so on. The fact of the water having reached
&ldquo;F&rdquo; deck, showed me she had been badly holed, but, at the
time, although I knew it was serious, I had not a thought that it was
likely to prove fatal; that knowledge was to come much later.</p>

<p>Up to this time we had had no chance for boat drill, beyond just
lowering some of the boats in Southampton. In any case, officers and
men in the Mercantile Marine are always impressed with the vital
importance of using their own heads, thinking for themselves, and
acting on their own initiative in an emergency.</p>

<p>Discipline in a Merchant Ship calls for the highest display of
individual intelligence and application. Each man must think for
himself. Whereas in the Navy, the Bluejacket must do as he is told,
nothing more and nothing less. All perfect in its own way where a man
is required to act with machine-like precision, but that won&rsquo;t
work in the Merchant Service. If a man does no more than he is told,
and makes that an excuse for leaving something undone, unseen or
unattended to, he is quickly asked, &ldquo;What the hell are your
brains for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The result is that a crew comes aboard a strange ship, and
everything seems like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. But there is just
this difference between the two Services. Whereas each man in the
Senior Service must be fell in, and detailed to his own particular job,
to which he has probably been trained for years, but by which method
each piece of the jigsaw must await the touch of the Master hand; in
the Merchant Service the whole of the pieces shake themselves together
without being &ldquo;fell in&rdquo; and &ldquo;told off.&rdquo; Thus,
in an amazingly short space of time, they have all shaken down and
become a homogeneous workable unit. If there should be a piece that
won&rsquo;t seen to fit, then all I can say is heaven help him!</p>

<p>You may be sure that the crew of the <i>Titanic</i> had been put
through a fine sieve, and particular care taken that there were no
misfits. The result was that when the call came&mdash;not the call of
bugles, but the call on every man to exhibit the highest individual
effort, intelligence and courage, the response was absolutely
universal&mdash;not a man failed.</p>

<p>The survivors of that night may thank God that our men did not wait
for bugles and pipes. Nevertheless, they put up as fine a show as has
ever been done in any sea tragedy in history. The final and conclusive
proof lay in the fact that every single boat in the ship was cleared,
swung out and safely lowered into the water and got away, without a
hitch of any kind.</p>

<p>The ship had been running under a big head of steam, therefore the
instant the engines were stopped the steam started roaring off at all
eight exhausts, kicking up a row that would have dwarfed the row of a
thousand railway engines thundering through a culvert.</p>

<p>All the seamen came tumbling up on the boat deck in response to the
order, &ldquo;All hands on deck&rdquo; just following the instinct that
it was here that they would be required. It was an utter impossibility
to convey an order by word of mouth; speech was useless, but a tap on
the shoulder and an indication with the hand, dark though it was, was
quite sufficient to set the men about the different jobs, clearing away
the boat covers, hauling tight the falls and coiling them down on deck,
clear and ready for lowering.</p>

<p>The passengers by this time were beginning to flock up on the boat
deck, with anxious faces, the appalling din only adding to their
anxiety in a situation already terrifying enough in all conscience. In
fact it was a marvel how they ever managed to keep their heads at all.
All one could do was to give them a cheery smile of encouragement, and
hope that the infernal roar would soon stop. My boats were all along
the port side, and by the time I had got my Watch well employed,
stripping the covers and coiling down, it became obvious to me that the
ship was settling. So far she had remained perfectly upright, which was
apt to give a false sense of security. Soon the Bosun&rsquo;s Mate came
to me and indicated with a wave of his hand that the job I had set him
of clearing away was pretty well completed. I nodded, and indicated by
a motion of my hand for him to swing out.</p>

<p>The <i>Titanic</i> was fitted with a well-known pattern of davit
called the &ldquo;Wellin.&rdquo; (sic) In operation it was merely a
matter of shipping and manning the handles of the davits, and the boats
were quickly swung out. By this time it was clear that the ship was
seriously damaged and making a lot of water. She struck the berg well
forward of the foremast, and evidently there had been a slight shelf
protruding below the water. This pierced her bow as she threw her whole
weight on the ice, some actually falling on her fore deck. The impact
flung her bow off, but only by the whip or spring of the ship. Again
she struck, this time a little further aft. Each blow stove in a plate,
below the water line, as the ship had not the inherent strength to
resist.</p>

<p>Had it been, for instance, the old <i>Majestic</i> or even the
<i>Oceanic</i> the chances are that either of them would have been
strong enough to take the blow and be bodily thrown off without serious
damage. For instance, coming alongside with the old <i>Majestic</i>, it
was no uncommon thing for her to hit a knuckle of the wharf a good
healthy bump, but beyond, perhaps, scraping off the paint, no damage
was ever done. The same, to a lesser extent with the
<i>Oceanic</i>.</p>

<p>Then ships grew in size, out of all proportion to their strength,
till one would see a modern liner brought will all the skill and care
possible, fall slowly, and ever so gently on a knuckle, to bend and
dent a plate like a piece of tin.</p>

<p>That is exactly what happened to the <i>Titanic</i>. She just bump,
bump, bumped along the berg, holing herself each time, till she was
making water in no less than six compartments, though, unfortunately,
we were not to know this until much later. Andrews, the designer, and
nephew of the late Lord Pirrie was making the trip with us and it was
he, familiar with every nook and corner in her who made a quick tour of
inspection with the Carpenter and reported her condition to Captain
Smith.</p>

<p>Actually the <i>Titanic</i> was so constructed and divided into
watertight compartments that she would float with any two compartments
full of water, and the margin of safety made it fairly certain that she
would still have floated with even three of the four forward
compartments full up. Although the water would have been above the
forward watertight bulkheads, it would still have been kept out of the
rest of the ship, despite the fact that the forward part of her would
have completely submerged. The whole ship would have assumed a fairly
acute and mighty uncomfortable angle, yet, even so, she would, in all
probability have floated&mdash;at least for some considerable time,
perhaps all day. Certainly for sufficient time for everyone to be
rescued; and, just possibly, until she could have been beached. But she
could not remain afloat when she was holed in the forward stokehold as
well. That made the fifth compartment counting from forward, that was
smashed in by the iceberg, and this finally sealed her fate.</p>

<p>By this time all the boats were swung out she was well down forward
and the water was practically level with the main deck. Even so I still
had no thought that she was actually going to founder. There had been
no chance or time to make enquiries, but I figured up in my own mind
that she had probably struck the berg a glancing blow with the bluff of
her bow and opened up one or perhaps two of the forward compartments,
which were filling and putting her down by the head; also that she
would go so far, until she balanced her buoyancy, and there she would
remain. Bulkheads were all new and sound and should be able to carry
the pressure, and there was no reason to suppose they would not have
been equal to their task. All watertight doors had been closed
automatically from the bridge, at the time of the collision&mdash;all
except one place where there was no door, but which, in any case, would
not have made any ultimate difference.</p>

<p>Although I was fairly confident in my own mind that she would not
sink, one has no right to risk an error of judgment that may entail
loss of life, particularly when it is the case of the passengers you
are carrying. They are your trust and must at all times be your first
consideration, to the total elimination of all personal feelings, or
personal impressions. It was fortunate we played for safety, for, as it
turned out, she was holed in no less than six compartments along the
starboard side, and <i>nothing</i> could have saved her.</p>

<p>Having got the boats swung out, I made for the Captain and happened
to meet him near by on the boat deck. Drawing him into a corner, and
cupping both my hands over my mouth and his ear, I yelled at the top of
my voice, &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better get the women and children into
the boats, sir?&rdquo; He heard me, and nodded reply. One of my reasons
for suggesting getting the boats afloat was, that I could see a
steamer&rsquo;s steaming lights a couple of miles away on our port bow.
If I could get the women and children into the boats, they would be
perfectly safe in that smooth sea until the other ship picked them up;
if the necessity arose. My idea was that I would lower the boats with a
few people in each, and when safely in the water fill them up from the
gangway doors on the lower decks, and transfer them to the other
ship.</p>

<p>Although boats and falls were all brand new, it is a risky business
at the best of times to attempt to lower a boat between seventy and
eighty feet at night time, filled with people who are not
&ldquo;boatwise.&rdquo; It is, unfortunately, the rule rather than the
exception for some mishap to occur in lowering boats loaded with people
who, through no fault of their own, lack this boat sense. In addition,
the strain is almost too much to expect of boats and falls under
ordinary conditions.</p>

<p>However, having got Captain Smith&rsquo;s sanction, I indicated to
the Bosun&rsquo;s Mate, and we lowered down the first boat level with
the boat deck, and, just at this time, thank heaven, the frightful din
of escaping steam suddenly stopped, and there was a death-like silence
a thousand times more exaggerated, fore and aft the ship. It was almost
startling to hear one&rsquo;s own voice again after the appalling din
of the last half hour or so.</p>

<p>I got just on forty people into No 4 boat, and gave the order to
&ldquo;lower away,&rdquo; and for the boat to &ldquo;go up to the
gangway door&rdquo; with the idea of filling each boat as it became
afloat, to its full capacity. At the same time I told the Bosun&rsquo;s
Mate to take six hands and open the port lower-deck gangway door, which
was abreast of No. 2 hatch. He took his men and proceeded to carry out
the order, but neither he or the men were seen again. One can only
suppose that they gave their lives endeavouring to carry out this
order, probably they were trapped in the alley-way by a rush of water,
but by this time the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle head was within about ten
feet of the water. Yet I <i>still</i> had hope that we should save
her.</p>

<p>Passing along to No 6 boat to load and lower, I could hear the band
playing cheery sort of music. I don&rsquo;t like jazz music as a rule,
but I was glad to hear it that night. I think it helped us all.</p>

<p>Wireless signals for help had been broadcast over the ocean ever
since the first impact, and ships were coming to our aid. It was
excusable that in some cases the Officer of the Watch on some ships
could hardly credit his senses, or believe the wireless operator when
told that the <i>Titanic</i>---that wonder of all mercantile wonders
was <i>sinking in mid-Atlantic</i>, and sending out calls for
assistance.</p>

<p>The wireless operator of the <i>Virginian</i> told me that when he
reported the fact to this Officer of the Watch, he was literally
chucked off the bridge, for trying to play what the O.O.W. was a
practical joke; it was only as he was being pushed past the chart-room
door, preparatory to being shot down the bridge ladder, that he landed
out with his foot, and gave a terrific kick on the panel of the door.
The wireless operator knew that the Captain was asleep in the
chart-room, and that this crash would bring him out with a jump. The
Officer of the Watch also realised when the report was officially made
to the Captain, that it was no joke, and that the <i>Titanic</i> was
truly in a bad way. They at once altered course and made all speed
towards us.</p>

<p>On the <i>Titanic</i> passengers naturally kept coming up and
asking, did I consider the situation serious. In all cases I tried to
cheer them up, by telling them &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but that it was a
matter of precaution to get the boats in the water, ready for any
emergency. That in any case that they were perfectly safe, as there was
a ship not more than a few miles away, and I pointed out the lights on
the port bow which they could see as well as I could.</p>

<p>At this time we were firing rocket distress signals, which explode
with a loud report a couple of hundred feet in the air. Every minute or
two one of these went up, bursting overhead with a cascade of
stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why were we firing these signals, if there was no
danger:&rdquo; was the question, to which I replied that we were trying
to call the attention of the ship nearby, as we could not get her with
wireless. <i>That ship was the &ldquo;Californian.&rdquo;</i>; Here
again we were to see exemplified what has become almost proverbial at
sea, that in cases of disaster, one ship, the first on the scene, will
be in a position to rescue, and yet, through some circumstance or
combination of circumstances, fails to make that rescue.</p>

<p>The distress signals we fired were seen by the Officer of the Watch
on the <i>Californian</i>, also be several members of her crew. Even
the flashes from our Morse lamp were seen but finally judged to be
&ldquo;Just the mast-head light flickering.&rdquo; Though at one time
the thought evidently did arise that we were trying to call them</p>

<p>To let pass the possibility of a ship calling by Morse, in the
existing circumstances then surrounding her was bad enough; but to
mistake distress signals was inexcusable, and to ignore them, criminal.
In point of fact, the O.O.W. alone saw and counted, five distress
signals (or, as he reported them to Captain Lord, &ldquo;five white
rockets&rdquo;). Evidently the Captain&rsquo;s curiosity was more than
a little aroused for him to ask, &ldquo;Are they company&rsquo;s
signals?&rdquo; To which the O.O.W. replied that he did not know, but
that they &ldquo;Appear to me to be white rockets.&rdquo; Captain Lord
merely told him to &ldquo;go on Morsing,&rdquo; and if he received any
further information to send it down to him.</p>

<p>It is an unqualified fact that every single one of our distress
signals&mdash;unmistakable and urgent calls for help, were clearly seen
by the <i>Californian</i>. These signals are never made, except in
cases of dire necessity. The O.O.W. of the <i>Californian</i> fully
appreciated this fact as was evidenced by his remark to the Apprentice
on watch with him, &ldquo;A ship is not going to fire rockets at sea
for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after counting eight &ldquo;rockets&rdquo; he again sent
down word to the Captain, with the added rider to the Apprentice,
&ldquo;be sure to wake him and tell him that altogether we have seen
eight of these white lights, like rockets, in the direction of this
other steamer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Precisely at 2:40 a.m. this Officer of the Watch again called
Captain Lord, this time by voice pipe, and told him that the ship from
which he had seen the rockets, had disappeared.</p>

<p>He spoke truly. <i>A great sea tragedy had been consummated before
his very eyes</i>.<br>
</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THIRTY THREE</h3>

<h4>WOMEN AND CHILDREN&mdash;ONLY</h4>

<p>The quiet orderliness amongst the passengers, and the discipline
amongst the crew, is a thing never to be forgotten. Many of the former
came quietly with offers of help. The Bosun&rsquo;s Mate and six of the
watch having been lost to me, the work had become very heavy, and still
heavier, as I detailed two of the remaining Watch to go away with each
boat as it was lowered. The practice was, to lower each boat until the
gunwale was level with the boat deck, then, standing with one foot on
the deck and one in the boat, the women just held out their right hand,
the wrist of which I grabbed with my right hand, hooking my left arm
underneath their arm, and so practically lifted them over the gap
between the boat&rsquo;s gunwale and the ship&rsquo;s side, from the
boat.</p>

<p>Between one boat being lowered away and the next boat being
prepared, I usually nipped along to have a look down the very long
emergency staircase leading direct from the boat deck down to
&ldquo;C&rdquo; deck. Actually built as a short cut for the crew, it
served my purpose now to gauge the speed with which the water was
rising, and how high it had got. By now the fore deck was below the
surface. That cold, green water, crawling its ghostly way up that
staircase, was a sight that stamped itself indelibly on my memory. Step
by step, it made its way up, covering the electric lights, one after
the other, which, for a time, shone under the surface, with a horribly
weird effect.</p>

<p>Still, it served a very good purpose, and enabled me to form an
accurate judgment as to how far she had gone, and how quickly she was
going down. Dynamos were still running, and deck lights on, which,
though dim, helped considerably with the work; more than could be said
of one very good lady who achieved fame by waving an electric light and
successfully blinding us as we worked on the boats. It puzzled me until
I found she had it installed in the head of her walking stick! I am
afraid she was rather disappointed on finding out that her precious
light was not a bit appreciated. Arriving in safety on board the
<i>Carpathia</i>, she tried to make out that someone had stolen her
wretched stick, whereas it had been merely taken from her, in response
to my request that someone would throw the damn thing overboard.</p>

<p>It had now become apparent that the ship was doomed, and in
consequence, I began to load the boats to the utmost capacity that I
dared. My scheme for filling up at the lower deck doors had gone by the
board&mdash;they were under water.</p>

<p>Many were the incidents of calm courage.</p>

<p>One young couple walked steadily up and down the boat deck
throughout pretty well the whole of the proceedings. Once or twice the
young chap asked if he could help. He was a tall, clean-bred Britisher,
on his honeymoon, I should say. The girl&mdash;she was little
more&mdash;never made the slightest attempt to come towards the boats,
much less to be taken on board, although I looked towards her several
times with a sort of silent invitation, but no, she was not going to be
parted from her man.</p>

<p>The order implicitly obeyed was, &ldquo;Women and children
only.&rdquo; The very highest tribute that is was possible for a human
being to pay would hardly do justice to or give the praise due to the
sheer courage shown by most women and children amongst the passengers
on that ship, individually and collectively. It made me unutterably
proud of the English speaking race. The conditions were all strange;
the ship was sinking and the boats were leaving, yet, neither man nor
woman attempted to get into a boat without being ordered.</p>

<p>In the case of a Major Peuchen, a Canadian by birth, who sent away
in one of the boats, unwarrantable blame was attached, at a later
date.</p>

<p>I was reduced to sending one seaman away in a boat, and on an
occasion, after ordering away a sailor to take charge, I turned round
to find that there was only one left to attend the boat falls, for
lowering away.</p>

<p><br>
 &ldquo;Someone for that fall,&rdquo; I called, and the next thing a
man who had sailed with me for many years, Hemming by name, replied,
&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir! All ready.&rdquo; Unknown to me he had stepped
out of the boat, back on board, to carry out what he considered the
more important duty. Bravery and self-sacrifice such as this was of
common occurrence throughout the night.</p>

<p>The boat was half way down when someone hailed me, saying,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no seaman in this boat, &ldquo;and at that moment I
had no one available. I called to the people standing around,
&ldquo;Any seaman there:&rdquo; No reply, and it was then that Major
Peuchen, when he saw that there were none of the ship&rsquo;s crew
available, said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a seaman, but I&rsquo;m a
yachtsman, if I can be of any use to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boat&rsquo;s falls, or ropes, by which the boat is lowered, hang
up and down from the davit head, about nine or ten feet from the
ship&rsquo;s side. I said to him, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re seaman enough
to get out on those falls, and get down into the boat, you may go
ahead.&rdquo; He did, and has been very unfairly criticised for
carrying out what was a direct order.</p>

<p>It was about this time that the Chief Officer came over from the
starboard side and asked, did I know where the firearms were?</p>

<p>As I pointed out before, it was the <i>First</i> Officer&rsquo;s
responsibility to receive firearms, navigation instruments, and so
forth. I have also said firearms on merchant ships are looked on as
ornamental more than useful, and as First Officer I had simply hove the
lot into a locker, in my original cabin, a locker that was of little
use owing to its inaccessibility.</p>

<p>Then, later on, had come the &ldquo;general post,&rdquo; whereby
Murdoch who was now First Officer, knew nothing about the firearms, and
couldn&rsquo;t find them when they were wanted&mdash;I say wanted,
rather than needed, because I still don&rsquo;t believe they were
actually needed.</p>

<p>I told the Chief Officer, &ldquo;Yes, I know where they are. Come
along and I&rsquo;ll get them for you,&rdquo; and into the First
Officer&rsquo;s cabin we went&mdash;the Chief, Murdoch, the Captain and
myself&mdash;where I hauled them out, still in all their pristine
newness and grease.</p>

<p>I was going out when the Chief shoved one of the revolvers into my
hands, with a handful of ammunition, and said, &ldquo;Here you are, you
may need it.&rdquo; On the impulse, I just slipped it into my pocket,
along with the cartridges, and returned to the boats. The whole
incident had not taken more than three minutes, though it seemed barely
worth that precious time.</p>

<p>As I returned along the deck, I passed Mr. and Mrs. Strauss (sic)
leaning up against the deck house chatting quite cheerily. I stopped
and asked Mrs. Strauss, &ldquo;Can I take you along to the
boats?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll stay here for the
present.&rdquo; Mr. Strauss, calling her by her Christian name said,
smilingly, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go along with him, dear?&rdquo;
She just smiled, and said, &ldquo;No, not yet.&rdquo; I left them, and
they went down together. To another couple, evidently from the Western
States, that I found sitting on a fan casing I asked the girl,
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me put you in one of the boats?&rdquo; She
replied with a very frank smile, &ldquo;Not on your life. We started
together, and if need be, we&rsquo;ll finish together.&rdquo; It was
typical of the spirit throughout.</p>

<p>Boat after boat was safely lowered into the water, with its human
freight of women and children, each with an ever-increasing cargo as it
became more apparent that the <i>Titanic</i> was doomed, and that the
ship to which we had looked for immediate help, was also a false hope.
Time and again I had used her lights as a means to buoy up the hopes of
the many that I now knew only too well, were soon to find themselves
struggling in that icy water.</p>

<p>Why <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> she hear our wireless calls? Why
<i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> her Officer of the Watch or some one of her crew,
see our distress signals with their showers of stars, visible for miles
and miles around?&mdash;a signal that is never used except when a ship
is in dire need of assistance. What wouldn&rsquo;t I have given for a
six inch gun and a couple of shells to wake them up I had assured and
reassured the passengers throughout those anxious hours, &ldquo;She
cannot help but see those signals, and must soon steam over and pick
everyone up.&rdquo; And what an absolutely unique opportunity Captain
Lord of the <i>Californian</i> had that night of rendering aid and
saving close on 1,500 lives. Nothing could have been easier than to
have laid his ship actually alongside the <i>Titanic</i> and taken
every soul on board. Yet, not a thing was done, not even their wireless
operator roused to see if there <i>were</i> any distress calls.</p>

<p>There are no police, fire brigades or lifeboats out at sea,
therefore it becomes nothing less than a fetish&mdash;the tenet above
all tenets in the religion among sailors that absolutely no effort
shall be spared in an endeavour to save life at sea. A man must even be
prepared to hazard his ship and his life.</p>

<p>Just before launching the last two lifeboats, I had made my final
hurried visit to the stairway. It was then conclusively evident that
not only <i>was</i> she going , but that she was going <i>very
soon</i>, and if we were to avoid the unutterable disgrace of going
down with lifeboats still hanging to the davits, there was not one
single moment to lose.</p>

<p>Hurrying back to the two remaining lifeboats still hanging in their
davits, I met the Purser, Assistant Purser, and the Senior and Junior
surgeons&mdash;the latter a noted wag&mdash;even in the face of
tragedy, couldn&rsquo;t resist his last mild joke, &ldquo;Hello,
Lights, are you warm?&rdquo; The idea of anyone being warm in that
temperature was a joke in itself, and I suppose it struck him as odd to
meet me wearing a sweater, no coat or overcoat. I had long since
discarded my great coat, even in pants and sweater over pyjamas alone I
was in a bath of perspiration. There was only time to pass a few words,
then they all shook hands and said, &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo; Frankly, I
didn&rsquo;t feel at all like &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; although I knew
we shouldn&rsquo;t have the ship under us much longer. The thing was to
get these boats away at all costs. Eventually, and to my great relief,
they were all loaded and safely lowered into the water.</p>

<p>The last lifeboat having got away, there remained No. 2 boat, which
was actually a small sea boat used for emergency purposes (in fact
often termed, &ldquo;The Emergency Boat&rdquo;), hanging in the
davits.</p>

<p>About this time I met all the engineers, as they came trooping up
from below. Most of them I knew individually, and had been shipmates
with them on different ships of the Line. They had all loyally stuck to
their guns, long after they could be of any material assistance. Much
earlier on the engine-room telegraphs had been &ldquo;Rung
off&rdquo;&mdash;the last ring made on board ships at sea, and which
conveys to the engine-room staff the final information that their
services below can be of no further use, that the case (from whatever
cause) is hopeless. At the same time it releases engineers and stokers
from duty, leaving them free to make the best of their way up to the
boats. Of course, in theory, each had his appointed place in a given
boat.</p>

<p>Since the <i>Titanic</i> disaster, each undoubtedly has. But before
that tragedy brought home to the world the utter fallacy of the
&ldquo;unsinkable ship&rdquo; I&rsquo;m afraid that many
&ldquo;appointed places&rdquo;&mdash;as far as lifesaving equipment was
concerned&mdash;were just so much theory, concocted ashore with a keen
eye to dividends.</p>

<p>Certainly there was no sailor who ever sailed salt water but who
smiled&mdash;and still smiles&mdash;at the idea of the
&ldquo;unsinkable ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was little opportunity to say more than a word or two to the
engineers. Up to that time they had known little of what was going on,
and it was surely a bleak and hopeless spectacle that met their eyes.
Empty falls hanging loosely from every davit head, and not a solitary
hope for any of them.</p>

<p>In point of fact, they were lost to a man, <i>not one single
survivor</i> out of the whole thirty-five.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</h3>

<h4>SHE FOUNDERS</h4>

<p>Arriving alongside the emergency boat, someone spoke out of the
darkness, and said, &ldquo;There are men in that boat.&rdquo; I jumped
in, and regret to say that there actually were&mdash;but they
weren&rsquo;t British, nor of the English speaking race. I won&rsquo;t
even attribute any nationality to them, beyond saying that they come
under the broad category known to sailors as &ldquo;Dagoes.&rdquo; They
hopped out mighty quickly, and I encouraged them verbally, also by
vigorously flourishing my revolver. They certainly thought they were
between the devil and the deep sea in more senses than one, and I had
the satisfaction of seeing them tumbling head over heels on to the
deck, preferring the uncertain safety of the deck, to the cold lead,
which I suppose they fully imagined would follow their
disobedience&mdash;so much for imagination&mdash;the revolver was not
even loaded!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any more women and children?&rdquo; was the cry, and we had
the greatest difficulty in finding sufficient to fill even this small
boat&mdash;of those who were willing to go and leave others behind.
Eventually, she was filled, and we lowered her away.</p>

<p>There now remained two folded boats of the Engleheart (sic) type,
with collapsible canvas sides, one on the deck by the davits of No. 2
emergency and one on the top of the officers&rsquo; quarters, both
firmly lashed down. The rope falls of No. 2 were hurriedly rounded up
and one collapsible boat hooked on and swung out ready for
lowering.</p>

<p>I stood partly in the boat, owing to the difficulty of getting the
womenfolk over a high bulwark rail just here. As we were ready for
lowering the Chief came over to my side of the deck and, seeing me in
the boat and no seaman available said, &ldquo;You go with her,
Lightoller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Praises be, I had just sufficient sense to say, &ldquo;Not damn
likely,&rdquo; and jump back on board; not with any idea of
self-imposed martyrdom&mdash;far from it&mdash;it was just pure impulse
of the moment, and an impulse for which I was to thank my lucky stars a
thousand times over, in the days to come. I had taken my chance and
gone down with the rest, consequently I didn&rsquo;t have to take any
old back-chat from anyone.</p>

<p>As this boat was being lowered, two men passengers jumped into her
from the deck below. This, as far as I know was the only instance of
men getting away in boats from the port side. I don&rsquo;t blame them,
the boat wasn&rsquo;t full, for the simple reason that we
couldn&rsquo;t find sufficient women, and there was no time to
wait&mdash;the water was then actually lapping round their feet on
&ldquo;A&rdquo; deck, so they jumped for it and got away. Good luck to
them.</p>

<p>With one other seaman I started to cast adrift the one remaining
Engleheart on top of the officer&rsquo;s quarters. We cut and threw off
the lashings, jumped round to the inboard side ready to pick up the
gunwale together and throw her bodily down on the boat deck. The seaman
working with me called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready, sir,&rdquo; and I recognised Hemmings&rsquo;
voice&mdash;the chap I had ordered away long before, and who had
returned on board to tend the falls, and in whose place I sent Major
Peuchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, is that you, Hemming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you gone?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>Oh, plenty of time yet, sir,&rdquo; he replied cheerily. Apparently
the chap had loyally stuck by me all through, though it had been too
dark to recognise him. Stout fellow. Later he slid one of the falls,
swam for it and was saved.</p>

<p>We had just time to tip the boat over, and let her drop into the
water that was now above the boat deck, in the hope that some few might
be able to scramble on to her as she floated off. Hemming and I then,
as every single boat was now away from the port side, went over to the
starboard side, to see if there was anything further to be done there.
But all the boats on this side had also been got away, through there
were still crowds of people on the deck.</p>

<p>Just then the ship took a slight but definite plunge&mdash;probably
a bulkhead went&mdash;and the sea came rolling up in a wave, over the
steel-fronted bridge, along the deck below us, washing the people back
in a dreadful, huddled mass. Those that didn&rsquo;t disappear under
the water right away, instinctively started to clamber up that part of
the deck still out of water, and work their way towards the stern,
which was rising steadily out of the water as the bow went down. A few
of the more agile leapt up on top of the officers&rsquo; quarters where
Hemming and I were at the moment. It was a sight that doesn&rsquo;t
bear dwelling on&mdash;to stand there above the wheelhouse, and on our
quarters, watching the frantic struggles to climb up the sloping deck,
utterly unable to even hold out a helping hand.</p>

<p>I knew, only too well, the utter futility of following that driving
instinct of self-preservation and struggling up towards the stern. It
would only be postponing the plunge, and prolonging the
agony&mdash;even lessening one&rsquo;s already slim chances by becoming
one of a crowd. It came home to me very clearly how fatal it would be
to get amongst those hundreds and hundreds of people who would shortly
be struggling for their lives in that deadly cold water. There was only
one thing to do, and I might just as well do it and get it over, so,
turning to the fore part of the bridge, I took a header. Striking the
water was like a thousand knives being driven into one&rsquo;s body,
and , for a few moments, I completely lost grip of myself, and no
wonder, for I was perspiring freely, whilst the temperature of the
water was 28&ordm; or 4&ordm; below freezing.</p>

<p>Ahead of me the look-out cage on the foremast was visible just above
the water&mdash;in normal times it would be a hundred feet above. I
struck out blindly for this, but only for a short while, till I got
hold of myself again and realised the futility of seeking safety on
anything connected with the ship. I then turned to starboard, away from
the ship altogether.</p>

<p>For a time I wondered what was making it so difficult for me to keep
my head above the water. Time and again I went under, until it dawned
on me that it was the great Webley revolver, still in my pocket, that
was dragging me down. I soon sent that on its downward journey.</p>

<p>The water was now pouring down the stokeholds, by way of the fiddley
gratings abaft the bridge, and round the forward funnel.</p>

<p>On the boat deck, above our quarters, on the fore part of the
forward funnel, was a huge rectangular air shaft and ventilator, with
an opening about twenty by fifteen feet. On this opening was a light
wire grating to prevent rubbish being drawn down, or anything else
being thrown down. This shaft led direct to No. 3 stokehold, and was
therefore a sheer drop of close on hundred feet, right to the bottom of
the ship.</p>

<p>I suddenly found myself drawn, by the sudden rush of the surface
water now pouring down this shaft, and held flat and firmly up against
this wire netting, with the additional full and clear knowledge of what
would happen if this light wire carried away. The pressure of the water
just glued me there whilst the ship sank slowly below the surface.</p>

<p>Although I struggled and kicked for all I was worth, it was
impossible to get away, for as fast as I pushed myself off I was
irresistibly dragged back, every instant expecting the wire to go, and
to find myself shot down into the bowels of the ship.</p>

<p>Apart from that, I was drowning, and a matter of another couple of
minutes would have seen me through. I was still struggling and fighting
when suddenly a terrific blast of hot air came up the shaft, and blew
me right away from the air shaft and up to the surface.</p>

<p>The water was now swirling round, and the ship sinking rapidly, when
once again I was caught and sucked down by an inrush of water, this
time adhering to one of the fiddley gratings. Just how I got clear of
that, I don&rsquo;t know, as I was rather losing interest in things,
but I eventually came to the surface once again, this time alongside
that last Engleheart boat which Hemming and I had launched from on top
of the officers&rsquo; quarters on the opposite side&mdash;for I was
now on the starboard side, near the forward funnel.</p>

<p>There were many around in the water by this time, some swimming,
others (mostly men, thank God), definitely drowning&mdash;an utter
nightmare of both sight and sound. In the circumstances, I made no
effort to get on top of the upturned boat, but, for some reason, was
content to remain floating alongside, just hanging on to a small piece
of rope.</p>

<p>The bow of the ship was now rapidly going down and the stern rising
higher and higher out of the water, piling the people into helpless
heaps around the steep decks, and by the score into the icy water. Had
the boats been around many might have been saved, but, of them, at this
time, there was no sign. Organised help, or even individual help, was
quite impossible. All one could do was just wait on events, and try and
forget the icy cold grip of the water.</p>

<p>The terrific strain of bringing the after end of that huge hull
clear out of the water, caused the expansion joint abaft No. 1 funnel
to open up. (These expansion joints were found necessary in big ships
to allow the ship to &ldquo;work&rdquo; in a seaway.) The fact that the
two wire stays to this funnel, on the after part led over and abaft the
expansion joint, threw on them an extraordinary strain, eventually
carrying away the port wire guy, to be followed almost immediately by
the starboard one. Instantly the port one parted, the funnel started to
fall, but the fact that the starboard one held a moment or two longer,
gave this huge structure a pull over to that side of the ship, causing
it to fall, with its scores of tons, right amongst the struggling mass
of humanity already in the water. It struck the water between the
Engleheart and the ship, actually missing me by inches.</p>

<p>Amongst the many historic and, what in less tragic circumstances,
would have been humorous&mdash;questions, asked by Senator Smith at the
Washington Enquiry was &ldquo;Did it hurt anyone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One effect of the funnel crashing down on the sea, was to pick up
the Engleheart in the wash so created, and fling it well clear of the
sinking ship.</p>

<p>When I again recognised by surroundings, we were full fifty yards
clear of the ship. The piece of rope was still in my hand, with old
friend Engleheart upturned and attached to the other end, with several
men by now standing on it. I also scrambled up, after spending longer
than I like to remember in that icy water. Lights on board the
<i>Titanic</i> were still burning, and a wonderful spectacle she made,
standing out black and massive against the starlit sky; myriads of
lights still gleaming through the portholes, from that part of the
decks still above water.</p>

<p>The fore part, and up to the second funnel was by that time
completely submerged, and as we watched this terribly awe-inspiring
sight, suddenly all lights went out and the huge bulk was left in black
darkness, but clearly silhouetted against the bright sky. Then, the
next moment, the massive boilers left their beds and went thundering
down with a hollow rumbling roar, through the bulk-heads, carrying
everything with them that stood in their way. This unparalleled tragedy
that was being enacted before our very eyes, now rapidly approached its
finale, as the huge ship slowly but sure reared herself on end and
brought rudder and propellers clear of the water, till, at last, she
assumed <i>an absolute perpendicular position</i>. In this amazing
attitude she remained for the space of half a minute. Then with
impressive majesty and ever increasing momentum, she silently took her
last tragic dive to seek a final resting place in the unfathomable
depths of the cold grey Atlantic.</p>

<p>Almost like a benediction, everyone round me on the upturned boat
breathed the two words, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortunately the scene that followed was shrouded in darkness. Less
fortunately, the calm still silence carried every sound with startling
distinctness. To enter into a description of those heart-rending,
never-to-be-forgotten sounds would serve no useful purpose. I never
allowed my thoughts to dwell on them, and there are some that would be
alive and well to-day had they just determined to erase from their
minds all memory of those ghastly moments, or at least until time had
somewhat dimmed the memory of that awful tragedy.<br>
</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</h3>

<h4>THE RESCUE</h4>

<p>However anyone that had sought refuge on that upturned Engleheart
survived the night is nothing short of miraculous. If ever human
endurance was taxed to the limit, surely it was during those long hours
of exposure in a temperature below freezing, standing motionless in our
wet clothes. That the majority were still standing when the first faint
streaks of dawn appeared is proof that whilst there is life there is
still some hope.</p>

<p>Hour by hour the compartments in this collapsible boat were surely
filling with water, due, no doubt to the rough and ready treatment she
had received when dumped incontinently from the top of our quarters,
with a crash on to the boat deck, there to float off of her own sweet
will.</p>

<p>The fact remains we were painfully conscious of that icy cold water,
slowly but surely creeping up our legs.</p>

<p>Some quietly lost consciousness, subsided into the water, and
slipped overboard, there being nothing on the smooth flat bottom of the
boat to hold them. No one was in a condition to help, and the fact that
a slight but distinct swell had started to roll up, rendered help from
the still living an impossibility.</p>

<p>It was only by the grace of being huddled together that most of us
didn&rsquo;t add to the many that lost their lives that night.</p>

<p>Another thing, with the rising sea I realised that without concerted
action , we were <i>all</i> going to be pitched headlong into the sea,
and that would spell finish for everyone. So I made everyone face one
way, and then, as I felt the boat under our feet lurch to the sea, one
way or the other, I corrected it by the order &ldquo;Lean to the
right,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stand upright,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lean to the
left,&rdquo; as the case may be.</p>

<p>In this way we managed to maintain our foothold on the slippery
planks by now well under water.</p>

<p>We knew that ships were racing to our rescue, though the chances of
our keeping up our efforts of balancing until one came along seemed
very, very remote. Phillips, the senior wireless operator, standing
near me, told me the different ships that had answered our call. Of
these, according to their positions, undoubtedly the <i>Carpathia</i>
was nearest and should be up with the position where the <i>Titanic</i>
sank, by daylight.</p>

<p>For encouragement, I passed on to those around, my rough calculation
and it certainly helped the struggle to keep up. As it turned out, the
information from Phillips, and the calculation, were about right,
though poor old Phillips did not live to benefit by it. He hung on till
daylight came in and we sighted one of the lifeboats in the distance.
We were beyond making her hear with our shouting, but I happened to
have in my pocket the ordinary whistle which every officer of the Watch
carries. This piercing sound carried, and likewise carried the
information (for what it was worth) that it was an officer making the
call.</p>

<p>Slowly&mdash;oh how slow it seemed&mdash;she worked her way towards
us. Meantime the boat under us showed unmistakable signs of leaving us
altogether. I think it must have been the final and terrible anxiety
that tipped the beam with Phillips, for he suddenly slipped down,
sitting in the water, and though we held his head up, he never
recovered. I insisted on taking him into the lifeboat with us, hoping
there still might be life, but it was too late. Altogether there were
thirty of us boarded the lifeboat, and later on I counted seventy-five
living, apart from those lying on the bottom boards. If a sea got up it
was going to take all my knowledge of boat-craft to keep her
afloat.</p>

<p>As daylight increased we had the thrice welcome sight of the Cunard
Liner <i>Carpathia</i> cautiously picking her way through the ice
towards us. We saw boat by boat go alongside, but the question was,
would she come our way in time? Sea and wind were rising. Every wave
threatened to come over the bows of our overloaded lifeboat and swamp
us. All were women and children in the boat apart from those of us men
from the Engleheart. Fortunately, none of them realised how near we
were to being swamped.</p>

<p>I trimmed the boat down a little more by the stern, and raised the
bow, keeping her carefully bow on to the sea, and hoping against hope
she would continue to rise. Sluggishly, she lifted her bows, but there
was no life in her with all that number on board.</p>

<p>Then, at long last, the <i>Carpathia</i> definitely turned her head
towards us, rounding to about 100 yards to windward. Now to get her
safely alongside! We couldn&rsquo;t last many minutes longer, and round
the <i>Carpathia&rsquo;s</i> bows was a scurry of wind and waves that
looked like defeating my efforts after all. One sea lapped over the
bow, and the next one far worse. The following one she rode, and then,
to my unbounded relief, she came through the scurry into calm water
under the <i>Carpathia&rsquo;s</i> lee</p>

<p>Quickly the bosun&rsquo;s chairs were lowered for those unable to
climb the sheer side by a swinging rope ladder, and little enough
ceremony was shown in bundling old and young, fat and thin, onto that
bit of wood constituting the &ldquo;Boatswain&rsquo;s Chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once the word was given to &ldquo;hoist away&rdquo; and up into the
air they went. There were a few screams, but on the whole, they took it
well, in fact many were by now in a condition that rendered them barely
able to hang on, much less scream</p>

<p>When all were on board, we counted the cost. There were a round
total of 711 saved out of 2,201 on board. Fifteen hundred of all ranks
and classes had gone to their last account. Apart from four junior
officers (sic) ordered away in charge of boats, I found I was the
solitary survivor of over fifty officers and engineers who went down
with her. Hardly one amongst the hundreds of surviving passengers, but
had lost someone near and dear.</p>

<p>Then there came the torment of being unable to hold out a vestige of
hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could not another ship have picked them up?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could they not possibly be in some boat overlooked by the
<i>Carpathia</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it not possible that he might have climbed on to an
iceberg?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After serious consideration it seemed the kindest way to be
perfectly frank and give the one reply possible. What kindness was
there in holding out a hope, knowing full well that there was not even
the <i>shadow</i> of hope. Cold comfort, and possibly cruel, but I
could see no help for it.</p>

<p>Countess Rothes was one of the foremost amongst those trying to
carry comfort to others, and through that sad trip to New York, there
were very many quiet acts of self-denial.</p>

<p>Everybody&rsquo;s hope, so far as the crew were concerned was that
we might arrive in New York in time to catch the <i>Celtic</i> back to
Liverpool and so escape the inquisition that would otherwise be
awaiting us. Our luck was distinctly out. We were served with Warrants,
immediately on arrival. It was a colossal piece of impertinence that
served no useful purpose and elicited only a garbled and disjointed
account of the disaster; due in the main to a total lack of
co-ordination in the questioning with an abysmal ignorance of the
sea.</p>

<p>In Washington our men were herded into a second-rate boarding house,
which might have suited some, but certainly not such men as formed the
crew of the <i>Titanic</i>. In the end they point blank refused to have
anything more to do with either the enquiry or the people, whose only
achievement was to make our Seamen, Quartermasters and Petty Officers
look utterly ridiculous. It was only with the greatest difficulty I was
able to bring peace into the camp&mdash;mainly due to the tact
exhibited by the British Ambassador, Lord Percy, and Mr. P.A. Franklyn
(sic), President of the International Mercantile Marine Co.</p>

<p>With all the goodwill in the world, the &ldquo;Enquiry&rdquo; could
be called nothing but a complete farce, wherein all the traditions and
customs of the sea were continuously and persistently flouted.</p>

<p>Such a contrast to the dignity and decorum of the Court held by Lord
Mersey in London, where the guiding spirit was a sailor in essence, and
who insisted that any cross questioner should at any rate be familiar
with at least the rudiments of the sea. Sir Rufus Isaacs&mdash;as he
was then&mdash;had started his career as a sailor. One didn&rsquo;t
need to explain that &ldquo;going down by the bow,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;going down by the head&rdquo; was one and the same thing. Nor,
that water-tight compartments, dividing the ship, were not necessarily
places of refuge in which passengers could safely ensconce themselves,
whilst the ship went to the bottom of the Atlantic, to be rescued
later, as convenient. Neither was it necessary to waste precious time
on lengthy explanations as to how and why a sailor was not an officer,
though an officer was a sailor.</p>

<p>In Washington it was of little consequence, but in London it was
very necessary to keep one&rsquo;s hand on the whitewash brush. Sharp
questions tht needed careful answers if one was to avoid a pitfall,
carefully and subtly dug, leading to a pinning down of blame on to
someone&rsquo;s luckless shoulders. How hard Mr. Scanlan and the legal
luminary representing the interests of the Seamen and Firemen, tried to
prove there were not enough seamen to launch and man the boats. The
same applied to the passengers, and quite truly. But it was inadvisable
to admit it then and there, hence the hard fought legal duels between
us. Mr. Scanlan&rsquo;s conquest of the higher legal spheres of recent
years proves he was no mean antagonist to face. His aim was to forth
the admission that I had not sufficient seamen to give adequate help
with the boats, and consequently that the ship was undermanned. How
many men did I consider necessary to launch a lifeboat?</p>

<p>&ldquo;What size lifeboat?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take one of the <i>Titanic</i>&rsquo;s lifeboats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I pointed out, &ldquo;it would depend greatly on
weather conditions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make your own conditions,&rdquo; replied by legal opponent
impatiently.</p>

<p>I suggested, as an example, we should take the wind as force six
Beaufort&rsquo;s scale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;there would be an accompanying
sea, or course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, yes,&rdquo; he again agreed, and fell into the trap which Lord
Mersey proceeded to spring, by informing Mr. Scanlan that in the
circumstances described it would be impossible to launch any boat.</p>

<p>So the legal battle went on.</p>

<p>Still, I think we parted very good friends.</p>

<p>A washing of dirty linen would help no one. The B.O.T. had passed
that ship as in all respects fit for sea in every sense of the word,
with sufficient margin of safety for everyone on board. Now the B.O.T.
was holding an enquiry in to the loss of that ship&mdash;hence the
whitewash brush. Personally, I had no desire that blame should be
attributed either to the B.O.T. or the White Star Line, though in all
conscience it was a difficult task, when handled by some of the
cleverest legal minds in England, striving tooth and nail to prove the
inadequacy here, the lack there, when one had known, full well, and for
many years, the ever-present possibility of just such a disaster. I
think in the end the B.O.T. and the White Star Line won.</p>

<p>The very point, namely the utter inadequacy of the life-saving
equipment then prevailing, which Mr. Scanlan and his confr&egrave;res
had been fighting tooth and nail to prove has since been wholly,
frankly, and fully admitted by the stringent rules now governing
British ships, &ldquo;Going Foreign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No longer is the Boat-Deck almost wholly set aside as a recreation
ground for passengers, with the smallest number of boats relegated to
the least possible space.</p>

<p>In fact, the pendulum has swing to the other extreme and the margin
of safety reached the ridiculous.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, I am never likely to forget that long drawn out
battle of wits, where it seemed that I must hold that unenviable
position of whipping boy to the whole lot of them. Pull devil, pull
baker, till it looked as if they would pretty well succeed in pulling
my hide off completely, each seemed to want his bit. I know when it was
all over I felt more like a legal doormat than a Mail Boat Officer.</p>

<p>Perhaps the heads of the White Star Line didn&rsquo;t quite realise
just what an endless strain it had all been, falling on one man&rsquo;s
luckless shoulders, as it needs must, being the sole survivor out of so
many departments&mdash;fortunately they were broad.</p>

<p>Still, just that word of thanks which was lacking, which when the
<i>Titanic</i> Enquiry was all over would have been very much
appreciated. It must have been a curious psychology that governed the
managers of that magnificent Line. Promotion and service in their
Western Ocean Mail Boats was the mark of their highest approval. Both
these tokens came my way, and fifteen of my twenty years under the red
Burgee with its silver star, were spent in the Atlantic Mail. Yet, when
after twenty years of service I came to bury my anchor, and awaited
their pleasure at headquarters, for the last time, there was a
brief,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are leaving us, are you. Well, Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A curious people!</p>

<p>However, that was not to be for some years, and I was yet to see
another of the Line, my old favourite, the <i>Oceanic</i>, swallowed up
by the insatiable sea.</p>

<p>Having at last finished with the &ldquo;<i>Titanic</i>
Enquiry,&rdquo; I again set about picking up the threads and found
myself once more signing Articles on the <i>Oceanic</i> with many that
had survived the <i>Titanic</i>. One well-known figure was missing from
the Shipping Office about this time and that was &ldquo;Old Ned&rdquo;,
known to all and sundry as just &ldquo;Ned.&rdquo; Actually, he was
responsible for the stokehold crowd, and a tougher bunch than the
firemen on a Western Ocean Mail boat it would be impossible to find.
Bootle seemed to specialise in the Liverpool Irishman, who was
accounted to be the toughest of the tough, and prominent amongst the
few that could stand up to the life, where life below consisted of one
endless drive. Even the engineers seemed to get tainted with that
unqualified &ldquo;toughness,&rdquo; for they must be able to hold
their own with the worst. This type reached its peak in the days of the
old <i>Majestic</i> and <i>Teutonic</i>. The conditions under which
firemen laboured in these boats, were inhuman. Little blame if the men
did become brutes. The heat of the stokehold alone, when driving under
the last ounce of steam, was terrible. Added to this, when in the Gulf
Stream, was the intense humidity.</p>

<p>It was no uncommon sight to see a man, sometimes two, three or even
four in a watch, hoisted up the ash-shoot with the bucket chain hooked
roughly round their arm-pits, to be dumped on deck unconscious. A few
buckets of water over them and then they were left to recover. Neither
must they be long about it, or up comes the Leading Fireman, who, with
strict impartiality, will apply both boot and fist to drive his dogs of
war below again.</p>

<p>The instructions were to keep up that &ldquo;arrow,&rdquo;
indicating the steam pressure, at all costs, regardless of body or
bones. Small wonder at the tales that used to creep about, of men gone
missing after a free fight, when sharp shovels are used as flails.</p>

<p><br>
 &ldquo;So and so missing, He must have gone overboard during the
night. Caught with the heat, poor beggar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, caught, all right, but perhaps with the sharp edge of a
shovel.</p>

<p>An engineer at one time was seen to go into the stokehold, and never
seen to come out, nor yet seen on deck. He was a particularly powerful
type of man and brutal withal, who hazed his watch to the limit in the
demand for steam, till the stokehold was Bedlam let loose. From that
day till this&mdash;though never mentioned ashore&mdash;his
disappearance was frankly attributed to the swift cut of a shovel from
behind, and his body shot into a furnace. The truth will never be
known, but from then on, and engineer never went into the stokehold
unaccompanied by his leading hand.</p>

<p>These were the type of men &ldquo;Old Ned&rdquo; was called upon to
supply and handle. Originally a fireman himself, he knew all the
tricks, and feared none. Tall, keen, alert. Perfect athletic build. A
hawk-like eye, and monstrous aquiline nose, that had been broken more
times than even he could remember. Slow of movement and quiet of
speech, with a voice that came rumbling from way down in his chest.</p>

<p>A couple of hundred toughs, crowing and jostling together, waiting
to sign on. &ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; towering above the tallest, comes
through the doorway and makes his way with hardly a check, surging
through, and throwing aside the Bootle toughs like a ship
contemptuously flinging off the little waves that would hold her. A
shoulder here, an elbow there. Nor would he hesitate to put the flat of
that huge hand of his on the flat of some more than usually
objectionable face, with the base of his wrist tucked neatly under the
chin. If the man was sensible, he stepped back, quickly and sharply,
regardless of the curses of those behind him, or how they might
retaliate. Arriving at the table, &ldquo;Ned&rdquo; quickly says,
&ldquo;<i>Stand back</i>&rdquo; to those who would crowd in with their
Discharge books held out. For be it known that there will be a full
score and more eager to accept every single vacancy. Even &ldquo;Brutal
Bootle&rdquo; looks with respect at a man who has gained that giddy
height, and been chosen by &ldquo;Ned&rdquo; for &ldquo;The Mail
Boat&rdquo; A vicious and resentful crowd they were, and though master
of the situation at the pay table, it was a different matter when
turning a dark corner in Dockland, as old &ldquo;Ned&rdquo; had known
to his cost, many a time and often. On the other hand, there was not a
pub within a mile or more radius, that he could not walk into and call
for enough beer to drown a man, had he wished. No fireman came ashore
from the Mail Boat, with his pay in his pocket but &ldquo;chalked one
up for Ned.&rdquo; Even a Chicago gangster might have envied the
cort&egrave;ge that finally followed &ldquo;Old Ned&rdquo; after
signing his last ship.</p>

<p>With the <i>Oceanic&rsquo;s</i> comfortable quarters, and bathrooms,
there was no call for the tough element, in fact it did not exist in
Southampton, where the mail boats were now running from. Again, she
introduced a reserve of power that enabled a steady speed to be kept.
In fact, the <i>Oceanic&rsquo;s</i> records for steady and consistent
running have never been equalled. Two consecutive runs of over three
thousand miles and not one minute of difference. Three consecutive
voyages and only one minute of difference between the times of leaving
Sandy Hook, New York, and passing the Wolf Rock off the Scillies.</p>

<p>We were bound home on that fateful August 4, 1914, when we got the
brief message that hostilities had broken out and were advised to
&ldquo;deviate from the recognised tracks.&rdquo; We did deviate, too,
for we saw no fun in being captured in a fine ship like the
<i>Oceanic</i>, right at the outbreak of war. Judge our anxiety when
nearing the Irish Coast, on seeing the masts and funnels of two ships
coming above the horizon&mdash;ships obviously of the cruiser variety.
The only question was <i>whose</i> cruisers? Well, anyway, we had to
get in sometime, and the chances were they were not Germans&mdash;so
we&rsquo;d better risk it. All the same, it was undoubted relief when
at last the white ensign also came above the rim of the sea.<br>
</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</h3>

<h4>THE WAR</h4>

<p>All the mail boats were potential cruisers, with built-in gun
platforms, so it was no surprise to see a shoal of draughtsmen, naval
architects, Government representatives, and so forth, hurl themselves
on board and turn our well-ordered routine into chaos, and the ship
into a man-o&rsquo;-battle, or an imitation one anyway, for we
didn&rsquo;t see ourselves doing much battling with old and antiquated
4.7&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>In due course&mdash;and a mighty long one&mdash;we commissioned as
one of His Majesty&rsquo;s ships, and hoisted the white ensign. Our
crew were duly &ldquo;fell in&rdquo; (something new for them right
away) and asked if they would wish to volunteer to remain in the ship
in view of the service for which she would be required.</p>

<p>It seemed rather a futile question to me, and one I could, with the
utmost confidence, have given the answer to in the next breath. The men
belonged to the ship, had been in her for years, and they had no
intention of leaving her unless they were chucked out, which certainly
would not happen so long as they had behaved themselves. If she was
going &ldquo;off the run&rdquo; there might be additional fun, which
would be welcome, but beyond that they were not interested. In response
to the order &ldquo;those now wishing to volunteer to remain in the
ship, once pace forward <i>march</i>,&rdquo; they all quietly walked
forward across the deck, to make evident that it was one very good
pace.</p>

<p>The Navy chap was a bit horrified, but I told him to never mind,
they understood in the main, what he meant.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a good sprinkling were Royal Naval Reserve men, and
ex-service men who were quickly drafted to other and perhaps more
useful spheres&mdash;we were sorry&mdash;and believe me, <i>so were
they</i>.</p>

<p>Our Carpenter and Bosun were informed that they were now Warrant
rank, which didn&rsquo;t seem to impress them greatly, till they found
themselves each invested with a sword. As old
&ldquo;Chips&rdquo;&mdash;not notorious for either cleanliness or
choice of language&mdash;asked me, &ldquo;What the hell am I supposed
to do with this damn thing? Take it round with me when I&rsquo;m
sounding ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What disgusted this quaint couple most was having to move their
quite comfortable quarters, as it was considered infra dig. to be
quartered so near the crew. When told the exact meaning of the words,
the Bosun feelingly replied, &ldquo;Infra dig., eh? If any of my watch
is looking for a nice thick ear, let &lsquo;em try the infra dig. on
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently he had not <i>quite</i> got the exact meaning, though he
certainly had the sense of it, and did not need a sword and new
quarters to put a point to it. A mail boat man in a mail boat, is a
round peg, fitting nicely into a round hole; a hole that is rapidly
squared with the introduction of Navy ways and manners. But when it
came to drafting a lot of Hebredian fishermen on us, they were
any-shaped pegs, endeavouring to fit impossible holes, naturally
leading to utterly impossible situations.</p>

<p>I was promoted to First Lieutenant and Mary of the Messdecks; also
the thankless task of trying to get these fellows from the north
firstly to understand English as we spoke it, and secondly, when it
took the form of orders, to instill in them just what was expected of
them, when these orders were given.</p>

<p>There were Action Stations, Collision Stations, Fire Stations, and
many other Stations and evolutions, but none that our fellows from the
north had ever heard of. Furthermore, it was sometime before they
realised that it was necessary to practice these efforts, so as to be
ready if and when the occasion arose. After a lengthy explanation of
what each individual was to do, where to go, and how to act, when Fire
Stations were sounded, the order was at last given to the bugler,
&ldquo;Sound off fire stations.&rdquo; This he did, immediately
followed by the &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; then the indication, &ldquo;Fire
in the forward magazine,&rdquo; and the bugle call, &ldquo;Carry
on.&rdquo; Everyone dashed off, except three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, what the hell are you standing there for?
Didn&rsquo;t you hear? Fire is in the forward magazine,&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now I ask you, what would you do when a big fellow, with his eyes
nearly popping out of his head, replied in sepulchral Scotch,
&ldquo;Guid God, sir, ye dinna say so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not that they were by any means born stupid, nor were they
scared, but they were a bit slow in the uptake. Excellent material, but
a wee bit raw, till they became accustomed to &ldquo;Navy Ways.&rdquo;
When anything needed doing, they, as with the Merchant Service men, had
a perfectly simple method of just slipping into it, and getting it
done, without waiting for pipes and whistles and bugle calls.</p>

<p>Our own Boatswain gave an amusing illustration once when an order
was given to clear and lower the gangway ladder. It was a great big
cumbersome teakwood affair, weighing a couple of tons. <i>His</i>
method in our way was to take a few hands, heave it out, and lower
away, in very short order, but no particular manner, except that the
operation embodies the essence of seamanship. But now we were the Navy,
and the hands must first of all be piped. Then fallen in. Then told off
with their Petty Officers for that particular job. By the time they
arrived down on the main deck, and started to get busy, the Bosun was
just about boiling with impatience, but being now a Warrant Officer,
must not lay his sacred hand to unseemly toil. I watched him, more than
a bit amused, as I&rsquo;d seen him have that ladder out, and down,
time and again, in the shortest of shakes. He stood it for a while,
then with a real Western Ocean Bosun&rsquo;s flow of language, he leapt
on to the ladder, yelled at a couple of his own men to &ldquo;Come
on&rdquo; and the rest of them to &ldquo;get the hell out of it.&rdquo;
Breaking all sacred Navy traditions and disregarding his rank, he had
the ladder tipped out and lowered down in not much more time than would
have been taken to clear it away.</p>

<p>Forcing the Merchant Service man into Navy ways was almost as hard
as making water run uphill. Yet, such is his adaptability, that within
a few months of was he clicked his heels and turned to the right about,
with the best. In fact, when the war was over, and we were back again
in our own happy and respective spheres it took him some time to quit
clicking his heels&mdash;and get some work done.</p>

<p>With our heterogeneous mixture we were bundled off on the Northern
Patrol. Gun crews formed of men who had never seen a gun before, much
less fired one. Small wonder then that when with the Fleet one night at
&ldquo;night firing&rdquo;, the ship towing target for us signalled
that it was quite all right, &ldquo;we were not hitting her, but
<i>would</i> we mind firing at the target, which was some few hundred
yards astern of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Oceanic</i> was really far too big for that patrol and in
consequence it was not long before she crashed on to one of the many
outlying reefs and was lost.</p>

<p>The fog was as thick as the proverbial hedge when she ripped up on
the rocks; and in all fairness one could not lay the blame on the
navigator&mdash;my old shipmate of many years, Davy Blair&mdash;trying
as he was to work that great vessel amongst islands and mostly unknown
currents.</p>

<p>The fact remains that early one morning she caught this outlying
reef, and was pounded to pieces by the huge sea then running. Lying
broadside on to the reef, with the tide setting strong on to it, she
was held there, lifting and falling each time, with a horrible grinding
crash. I know it nearly broke my heart to feel her going to bits under
my very feet, after all these years. The sensation, as those
knife-edged rocks ground and crunched their way through her bilge
plates, was physically sickening.</p>

<p>How she held together long enough for us to get everyone out of her
was a miracle in itself, and certainly testified to the good work put
in by Harland and Wolff.</p>

<p>What with the heavy sea and swift current&mdash;to say nothing of
the fog&mdash;we had our work cut out to get the stokers and engineers
away without loss of life. With the seamen, and eventually the
officers, although the weather conditions had become markedly worse,
the operation was somewhat easier. Our much discussed Hebredian
contingent certainly shone that day. The calm and collected manner in
which they went about their work made it seem as if abandoning ship,
under such trying conditions as then existed, was of daily occurrence
with them&mdash;personally I was tremendously glad of their
self-reliant help, and proud of their fearless ability.</p>

<p>We stood by in the boats till next morning when another ship of the
Patrol turned up in response to our wireless signals. All the same, I
couldn&rsquo;t resist taking my boat back alongside what was left, at
daylight, to have a last look at my old love&mdash;this, despite
frantic signals from our rescuer who, as it turned out, had just had
information regarding an enemy submarine in the vicinity.</p>

<p>I jumped on board the old hooker for a quick look round. A last
glance at the old cabin where I had spent so many comfortable
hours&mdash;and damnably uncomfortable ones. Then, just as I was
rushing out to return to my boat, whose crew were expecting the ship to
roll over on top of them every minute, I spotted the ship&rsquo;s clock
on the bulkhead. The clock I had looked at so lovingly, when I came
below for eight long hours, but whose inevitable fingers I had cursed
so heartily as they drew inexorably nearer the last zero minute, when I
must at last leap out of my warm bunk to hurriedly dress, and dash for
the bridge.</p>

<p>All these and many other memories seemed to lie behind that smug and
friendly face. On the impulse of the moment, I seized it in both hands,
and tore it bodily from off its wooden wall, and bore it away in
triumph.</p>

<p>I still look at it and call up many happy memories&mdash;but now on
board my own little craft.</p>

<p>I got a severe strafeing from the impatient skipper, who said I was
responsible for more grey hairs in his already grey head; I
didn&rsquo;t mind his grousing, I had my clock.</p>

<p>I was never so fond of any ship as the <i>Oceanic</i>, either before
or since, and her loss was like the snapping of the last link that held
me to the Merchant Service and the White Star Line. Aboard her it had
been like carrying my home to the War, but now I felt I was into the
War neck and crop.</p>

<p>Back to barracks at Devonport, a cushy job for those that liked to
start playing bridge in the forenoon and continue consistently
throughout the day. I&rsquo;m not particularly fond of Bridge,
immediately after breakfast, even if there was a War.</p>

<p>Davy Blair, my old <i>Oceanic</i> pal, and I volunteered for a job
that we had got wind of in the Flag Lieutenant&rsquo;s office. The main
qualification for the men who were to get it, we were told, as that
they should be &ldquo;Hard Cases.&rdquo; Well, Davy and I had both done
the Western Ocean, and knew it in its worst moods these many years. If
the Mail Boat Service didn&rsquo;t qualify us as far as weather was
concerned, then nothing ever would.</p>

<p>We were accepted and told to get fixed up with fishermen&rsquo;s
rig, such as is use by the Brixham trawlers. A visit down sailor town
soon completed the outfit, blue jersey, smock, rough serge pants, heavy
weather cap, and seaboots, making us the imitation of a perfect
fisherman. My first disguise! And if I looked as big a fool as I felt,
then I&rsquo;d need to be sorry for the success of our venture.</p>

<p>Davy was given a section of the coast from Newquay round the Lizard
including Falmouth to Dodman point. Here my section ended and carried
on past Mevagissey, Looe, round by Plymouth, Start Bay, Dartmouth and
on past Tor Bay to Teignmouth. A fairly big patrol with a roving
commission to find out what I could get, and report back in a
week&rsquo;s time to the C. in C. Devonport. My craft was a pure and
simple Brixham smack, with no attempt to disguise the discomforts.</p>

<p>I arranged with my wife to meet me in Brixham in a couple of
days&rsquo; time, and for her to do a bit of snooping on her own
account along the shore side. Also I asked the Flag Lieutenant to take
the necessary precaution of notifying the War Stations and Coastguards
along the coast and any others likely to trip me up.</p>

<p>We sailed away merrily into the teeth of a S.W. gale and I can truly
say, it was somewhat different from sea going in an Atlantic liner.</p>

<p>After cruising along that ironbound coast from Bolt Tail to the
Start, we at last got a bit of welcome shelter in Start Bay. The
weather easing down, we cruised along close in shore making slowly for
Berry Head. Just before opening the Dart, I was examining the cliffs of
Penlee Point just outside Dartmouth, with a pair of strong glasses,
when I noticed two sets of steps cut in the cliff and leading down to
deep water. Nothing terribly unusual, but odd. However, I tucked it
away for future reference, pushed on to Brixham, and trotted off ashore
to make tough with the Coastguard, as arranged with my wife. Of course,
in Brixham every one knows everyone; therefore it was perfectly
apparent that for one thing I didn&rsquo;t belong, and for another that
I was no fisherman.</p>

<p>I trudged out to the Head to find that no lady of that nor any other
description had been along nor had they been notified as to anyone of
my name, type, size or build, and furthermore, not to put too fine a
point on it, who was I anyway?</p>

<p>My advice to them was to get in touch with the C. in C. and find
out. Meantime I clumped off back, smock, seaboots and all. Half way
down the hill I met an antiquated growler coming up, and sitting in it
was the wife of my bosom.</p>

<p>At the first hail the cabby just <i>looked</i>, but he did not stop.
At the second hail he did stop and leaning through the cab window I
informed the lady that I had already been to the coastguard and that
they didn&rsquo;t know me from a crow, but were evidently out to
satisfy their own curiosity. Well! We&rsquo;d try and make for an hotel
and get some inward comfort. This we did, and as I opened the door of
the cab and took the seat beside my wife, an audible whisper went round
from the crowd that by this time had collected, &ldquo;E&rsquo;s got in
with &lsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My wife, by this time, was thoroughly enjoying the War. But
I&rsquo;d an idea that another war was coming, and I wasn&rsquo;t very
far wrong. When we got to the hotel my wife went inside to do the
chaffering whilst the crowd paraded past the cab window. I took off my
smock. Not a bit ashamed they just peeped round through the window. As
last, completely fed up, I got out of the cab, and stood on the steps
of the hotel to give them a really good view. Apparently they decided
then and there that I was a German spy, and that, without a shadow of a
doubt.</p>

<p>My wife came out with the information that they would take us in.
But I decided that if I was going to be stared at, or run in, it was
not going to be in those ridiculous clothes. So back on board I went
and changed into mufti. Of course, that completely tore it. There was
not a shadow of doubt left that I had at least a couple of German
Cruisers, if not in my pocket, then they were on board the smack, which
as I have said, hailed from Brixham.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t a bit surprised when the Chief officer of Coastguards
called with his retinue, no doubt supported by the local constabulary
secreted behind the door. In the meantime I had tucked away a much
needed meal, and in consequence, my somewhat vivid welcome to Brixham
had to some extent paled, with the result that explanations followed
and we were soon good friends and we remained good friends throughout
the time I had that patrol.</p>

<p>The Flag Captain was the culprit, he had completely forgotten to
notify anyone.</p>

<p>My wife enlisted the local padre and made one or two useful
enquiries regarding Penlee House (where I had discovered the steps)
whlst I had a nose round from the seaward side.</p>

<p>The unanimous opinion of our committee of three was that we did not
like the look of the place one bit, and I reported back to the C. in C.
to that effect. &ldquo;All right, that&rsquo;s fine. Take the
<i>Kermac</i>. Keep our eye on the coast I&rsquo;ve given you, and the
spot you mention in particular. Push off, but don&rsquo;t get foul of
the Military authorities ashore, if you can possibly avoid it.</p>

<p>Being &ldquo;in all respects ready for sea,&rdquo; I found myself
outside Plymouth Breakwater, Captain of the Iceland trawler
<i>Kermac</i> armed to the teeth with a Six-pounder and ready to do
battle with the best. Also I had been presented with a nice selection
of foreign flags, any one of which I was at liberty to dangle in front
of a prowling periscope, as an inducement for him to come up and be
sunk. &ldquo;But you must be careful to break out the White Ensign and
haul down your foreign colours before you actually open
fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, that was all right. The orders were quite sound, and I daresay
the precaution necessary. All the same, I should have been sorry for
the sub that relied upon our choice of the correct flag being hoisted
at the precise and exact moment.</p>

<p>As a first effort we went steaming gaily past a War signal station
under the <i>Dutch</i> colours, and never saw his frantic signals
challenging our identity. Of course this extremely suspicious
occurrence was instantly flashed far and wide. &ldquo;Look out for
suspicious vessel passing up the coast flying Dutch colours.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Stop and examine her.&rdquo; As it happened we did not pass up
the coast; I suddenly took a notion, when off the Start, to push off
into mid channel for the night, on the off-chance of falling in with
some sort of adventure</p>

<p>When it was discovered we had disappeared into the blue, then
everyone got on their toes and at least one division of Destroyers was
despatched to take up the chase. We fell foul of this little lot at
daylight next morning, just as we were about to enter Dartmouth, after
our night&rsquo;s outing. No doubt the Destroyer Skippers were also on
edge after being kept out on a wild goose chase all night. Still that
was no sort of excuse for opening fire before they even got in range.
Probably they were a bit befogged after being at sea so many hours, and
it didn&rsquo;t dawn on them that once inside Dartmouth I should be
reasonably safe, as I could not very well disappear overland or even up
the Dart, drawing over sixteen feet. However, having successfully
carried out the intricate man&oelig;uvre of surrounding me, with guns
and torpedo-tubes, trained to a nicety in case I did take an
ill-advised notion to suddenly submerge or even rise out of the water
and vanish into the clouds&mdash;the representative of the Senior
Officer of the Division came on board, and with due solemnity I
escorted him to my cabin and stood him a drink.</p>

<p>Penlee Point is a cliff rising sheer out of the sea, and Penlee
House sits thereon facing seaward. Day by day, and week by week our
suspicious increased until at last one night I happened to see the
occupants flagrantly signalling out to sea with coloured lights. I was
now absolutely certain that the house was being used for imparting
information to submarines off shore, but I kept the information to
myself in the hopes of being able to bag the submarine. It was more
than likely there was only one submarine working here at a time. It is
a rocky and risky bit of coast, and for some time I was puzzled to
account to the accuracy of navigation that would let a submarine
approach with the certainty of getting into the exact line of light for
receiving signals. The method of signalling was such that unless you
were in the precise line of light the signals were absolutely
invisible. I happened on the solution to that purely by chance.</p>

<p>We had been over towards the French Coast one night, and were
returning in the early morning as usual to Dartmouth&mdash;which I used
as a sub-base. Just as daylight was breaking, we picked up the English
coastline, which I examined very closely, trying to locate Berry Head
or the Start, in order to get the rough bearing on the entrance to the
Dart. By and by the sun rose and it shone directly on the land ahead,
which showed up in a black irregular line. But on this black hillside I
could make out through my glasses a distinct, short, vertical white
line, looking all the whiter by contrast with the surrounding
blackness. As we approached, this white line became still more and more
distinct. From the bearing of Berry Head and the Start (by now well in
sight) I knew we must be heading just about direct for the mouth of the
Dart, and therefore, this white line must be on the hillside just
outside Dartmouth, and above Penlee Point.</p>

<p>Now, back of Penlee House, the main road runs, and on the other side
of the road is steep rising ground, and on the hillside there are three
houses which had always seemed to have an odd look about them, but up
to that time I had not been able to put my finger on where the oddness
lay. I now discovered that their odd look was due to the fact that they
were painted all white. White fronts, white roofs, and even white
chimneys. Coming in from the sea these three houses formed a distinct
white line, which if kept in line led you direct to the steps at the
base of the cliff. At night, a light in the centre window of each
house, kept in line would not only lead in, but would give you the
precise distance off the land, when the ridge of the roof of the house
in front cut off the light of the house behind. Perfectly simple.
Absolutely effective.</p>

<p>A very sore point with the Brixham fishermen was that Start Bay had
been closed for years to trawlers, although this bay is noted for its
very fine soles. Across this sheltered bay runs a sandy shoal,
protecting it from a swell from seaward. Here was the submarine&rsquo;s
base, from where she operated in perfect immunity, whilst from the
house she got her information as to what ships were expected up and
down channel.</p>

<p>It was from here that she obtained her information that H.M.S.
<i>Formidable</i> was bound down channel. She waited for her off the
Start, and sunk her with pretty heavy loss of life. When that took
place, then things did begin to move a bit, but up until then I had
steadily bucked my head against the brick wall of Navy Customs and
traditions. I was loath to tell all I knew for fear that I should scare
my bird away before I could catch her. That nearly happened after
telling the C. in C. about some of the signalling I had seen at times.
As it had taken place from the shore I suppose etiquette compelled him
to inform the O. C. troops of the district. Be that as it may, the very
next morning, two British heroes mounted on their chargers, in full
uniform, Sam Browns and swords complete, rode up to Penlee House,
knocked, and demanded to be told &ldquo;Why had they been signalling
out to sea, and to whom?&rdquo; The inhabitants of the house were
unreasonably reticent, for I don&rsquo;t believe they told a word about
the submarine!</p>

<p>It is hard to believe, and the only extenuation one can offer is
that it was early in the war. We had not yet taken off our gloves and
that likewise was the reason I suppose, why the authorities at
Devonport would not consent to supplying me with a depth charge to deal
with my lively little quarry. Beyond sending more and more ships for
the patrol, till I had a fleet of twenty, nothing would move them. The
powers were concerned that the submarine was merely using this place to
take in oil. The tune changed when the <i>Formidable</i> went down, and
they then took off their gloves and went for her baldheaded, eventually
blowing her up off the Slapton Sands where she had been hiding all
along. Unfortunately, and to my bitter disappointment, I was not in at
the death. I was in hospital. Not with honourable wounds, but of all
wretched things, with measles!<br>

<h3>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h3>

<h4>SEAPLANES AND GRASS LINES</h4>

<p>When I was at last released from the Naval hospital it was to find
that the fiat had gone forth &ldquo;all permanent Naval Reserve
Officers to the Grand Fleet.</p>

<p>Well, one must take the rough with the smooth, but I made up my mind
that I would not spend a day longer on that tack than I could help. I
knew only too well the ghastly monotony of battleship life. However, I
was in luck, I was not sent to a battleship, but to the old Cunarder
<i>Campania</i>, now also H.M.S. but even so, there was every prospect
of something livelier than sitting in a wardroom drinking<br>
 Gin-and-It</p>

<p>She was a comic, all right, and we were a comic crowd. Officers and
men, R.N., R.N.R., R.N.V.R., R.N.A.S. The only tribe we lacked was
Chinamen. I was appointed Watchkeeper, for when there was anything to
watch, and Observer for when there was anything to observe. This was
not going to be too bad, seaplanes being what they were, or as it
turned out, what they were not.</p>

<p>We had many types of seaplane. The majority rejoiced in the
designation of &ldquo;White&rsquo;s Coffins&rdquo; perhaps because they
were painted white, and made quite suitable marine tombstones.
Frequently they got off the water, but more frequently they
didn&rsquo;t. When they did, I observed. When they didn&rsquo;t I
usually got wet swimming to a boat.</p>

<p>When we were practising in Scapa Flow there was always a convenient
boat in attendance, or at any rate within hail. When doing P.Z.&rsquo;s
with the Fleet at sea, there wasn&rsquo;t, which always gave added zest
to the game, for if you came down, you stayed down.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions off Iceland, when the Blue Fleet,
representing the Germans, had gone off into the blue; and we, the Red
Fleet were going to find them, the <i>Campania</i> was ordered to
&ldquo;Up Seaplanes and at &lsquo;em.&rdquo; They were got out, but not
up! At least, out of a round dozen that were put in the water, one
alone took off safely, and that, luckily, or unluckily, according to
whether you were in her or not, was mine, and off we flipped, to locate
the &ldquo;Enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In front of me, I had my Code book, Morse keys and such navigating
instruments as were then in vogue, that day of Our Lord; and they were
primitive, like everything else connected with the air.</p>

<p>Having run out our aerial, I commenced to &ldquo;keep the Flag
informed,&rdquo; or was pleased to think I did.</p>

<p>There happened to be a nice low layer of clouds above which we could
hide ourselves, coming down from time to time to have a squint round.
Of course, we knew in what direction the enemy lay. That&rsquo;s part
of the game. If you don&rsquo;t know that you can&rsquo;t find and
fight each other, so what&rsquo;s the use! We eventually made contact
and found. There they were, laid out below us for all the world like a
fleet of toyships on a bit of blue glass, each surrounded by a bit of
cotton wool.</p>

<p>So many battleships. So many cruisers. So many destroyers. Heading
so and so, at such and such a speed. All this I carefully coded, and as
carefully tapped out.</p>

<p>Another call to the Flagship, and a &ldquo;repeat&rdquo; of the
information&mdash;just to make sure; then wind up the aerial and
&ldquo;Home John,&rdquo; after a good day&rsquo;s work, being quite
sure that our side would now win, and we would be the shy recipients of
loads of kudos&mdash;if not personal congrats, from Jellicoe
himself.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s one thing to say &ldquo;Home, John,&rdquo; and
another to get there. The &ldquo;Home&rdquo; in this case being a fast
moving and mighty small unit, somewhere in the sea between Iceland,
Shetland and Norway. It wasn&rsquo;t long before we should have been
glad to surrender ourselves to the &ldquo;Enemy,&rdquo; only we&rsquo;d
lost him too! Then, just before we ran completely out of petrol, we
found someone and down we came. To our unmitigated relief it was our
own fleet, and we were soon swinging at the end of the derrick, being
hoisted back on board. The fight, apparently, was over, but to our
utter disappointment, such is the fortune of war and bad wireless, they
had not heard a word from us since we had left!</p>

<p>Next thing I was put on to teach the young idea how to
&ldquo;Observe.&rdquo; It is a great game teaching others what you
don&rsquo;t know yourself. It does need tact, but then this was war. So
I went to work and formed my classes, bluffed out a syllabus, and
turned out &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; Observers.</p>

<p>As time went on we got more and more bottled in by subs. Snooping
around outside the net defences, with occasional mild excitements, such
as a cruiser charging blindly through the nets, fondly thinking the
boom was open, only to find himself hung up by the tail with a mixture
of nets, and propellers to disentangle when the weather moderated. But
for a couple of days, there she hung with a S.W. gale doing its very
best to make things thoroughly enjoyable for all on board. Some of the
chaps told us, when they did get clear, that they were sure she rolled
completely over a couple of times, and came up the other side; but I
think that was an exaggeration. A self-respecting ship doesn&rsquo;t do
such things!</p>

<p>Then, of course, there was the&rdquo;Battle of Scapa Flow&rdquo;
when Destroyers and Light Cruisers, playing &ldquo;follow my
leader&rdquo; slipped their moorings and joined issue with the splashes
from other&rsquo;s falling shell. I think in the final analyses it was
quite agreed that it must have been a porpoise, not a periscope in the
first instance, that broke surface on that memorable day.</p>

<p>Perhaps the officer of the day who started the commotion had not had
enough water in it and seeing the porpoise, let rip. Others, quite
excusably, joined the fun, firing at the splashes of the original
joker&rsquo;s shells, which were quite easily to be mistaken for an
enemy submarine breaking surface.</p>

<p>Whoever the humorist was that started it, he modestly and wisely hid
his light under the proverbial bushel, despite a silent, though hearty
vote of thanks for creating the little diversion.</p>

<p>Being H.M.S. we must, of course, carry out our routine with H.M.S.
precision. Each little evolution neatly labeled and named. One such was
called &ldquo;Away salvage party,&rdquo; used mainly for the purpose of
retrieving strayed or erring seaplanes&mdash;and the &ldquo;Away
salvage party&rdquo; got plenty of practice. Particularly as the
skipper refused to have them retrieved in any other manner. One chap
conked his engine when <i>just</i> out of reach of the ship&rsquo;s
boom, and as a goodly breeze was blowing, he rapidly sailed away to
leeward, and incidentally, towards a line of particularly repulsive and
jagged rocks. It would have been a simple matter to have chucked him a
line, as he drifted past the after deck. But no, that would have been
too simple. It was a fine day, and the sun shone. We would show the
Fleet and the Battle Squadron in particular (of which we were a unit)
just how things <i>should</i> be done. With that was piped &ldquo;Away
salvage party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up came the crew of the motor boat, with fire appliances, life
jackets, and what not. Fell in. Told off, and then tumbled into their
boat. Now comes the boat to the stern, to take the end of a grass line
to the adventuring seaplane, by this time well away to leeward. Off
dashes the boat at little short of twenty knots, but the line soon
proves to be too short, and with a quick turn taken round the mooring
bitts on board she is brought up with a sudden and mighty jerk,
throwing all the crew on their faces. Fortunately they were too far
away for us to hear what <i>they</i> had to say. Another line is
procured and bent-on, then away they go again.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of the grass rope species is (and for which reason it
is used) that it floats on the surface of the water, which in this case
formed the contributory cause to our popularity.</p>

<p>First came the <i>Dreadnought&rsquo;s</i> picket boat with a four
striper on board. The coxswain watching our evolution, sees not the
grass line, which he neatly picks up with his prop, and stays put.
&ldquo;Mark one.&rdquo; Next turn was the pinnace of the Flagship with
the Vice Admiral on board. No favouritism is to be shown even if he is
a V.A. Neither does the coxswain take warning by the other picket boat,
nor see the line, and the next moment we have him securely hooked.
Altogether three boats, including our own (by now quite helpless) were
attached to our line, which reached by this time half way across a
goodly section of Scapa Flow. (Where was Heath Robinson now?)
Meanwhile, the erring seaplane having reached the rocks, is now in an
advanced state of disintegration, the crew electing to salvage
themselves, land on the rocks, light their pipes, and watch the process
of disentanglement. The next day we were the recipients of quite a
choice selection of signals. But such was life with the Grand
Fleet.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</h3>

<h4>DOVER PATROL</h4>

<p>Having spent one winter and one summer in this manner, I was not
looking forward with pleasurable anticipation to another winter in
those latitudes. Darkness at 2 p.m. daylight at 10 a.m., is not funny
when there is little or nothing to do. So there were shouts of joy when
we heard the good news, with the inevitable introductory preamble
&ldquo;Being in all respects ready for sea,&rdquo; we &ldquo;were to
proceed with all dispatch&rdquo; to Liverpool for refit.</p>

<p>With a bit of luck I was going to see the last of that old hybrid,
and she was going to see the last of me. A talk with the Skipper. A
little judicious strain placed on a few correct strings and then
&ldquo;Would I like an independent command?&rdquo; <i>Would I not</i>.
In due course my appointment to H.M.T.B. 117 came through, just before
Christmas day! No matter. I&rsquo;d willingly sacrifice Christmas Day
and a good deal more to get away from that deadly monotony of
&ldquo;Somewhere in the North Sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Life was now worth while. Hectic and hard, but more what I was used
to. It wasn&rsquo;t long before I distinguished myself in the Nore
Defence Flotilla by discovering a bank that wasn&rsquo;t there, and
bending my main shaft in consequence. The N.D.F., as we were called,
had been given a retreat up Stangate Creek off the Medway, with the
parent ship lying at the mouth. One bright and cheery morning, I had
difficulty in getting away from my moorings and, as a result, had
dropped well &ldquo;astern of station&rdquo;. To make up, we were doing
about 18 knots (instead of the sternly regulated eight for the creek)
when my prop took ground. I quickly took a bearing by the buoys, and
noted the position.</p>

<p>So much inshore from those buoys there <i>should</i> have been deep
water, according to the chart. Well, there wasn&rsquo;t, and that was
that. Now, should I make the usual statement. &ldquo;Regret to report
having struck wreckage in the Black Deep during the night of so and
so,&rdquo; or should I stick to my guns and say that there was no water
there, and chance my arm. Well, wisely or unwisely, I took the latter
course, and got my leg pulled unmercifully in consequence. &ldquo;A new
discovery. Lightoller&rsquo;s bank!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ho! Ho! Ho! Had
anyone seen Lightoller&rsquo;s bank?&rdquo; This in addition to shirty
signals from the Flag to &ldquo;go and find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Survey Boat had been cruising around for days and the chap in
charge happened to have been a shipmate of mine in the old White Star
days, Harbord, by name. &ldquo;Well, Lightoller,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry but <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t find it.&rdquo;
We sounded, and better sounded. Yes, tons of water, where I had said
there wasn&rsquo;t! and I began to scent a Court of Enquiry.</p>

<p>Finally, and for no reason, Harbord says, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go off
to No. 1 buoy and take a shot. We did, but frankly I don&rsquo;t know
to this day what spirit moved him. When the coxswain gave his reading
from his sextant, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; says Harbord, &ldquo;you must be
wrong. Here take this sextant and see what you get.&rdquo; He did.
&ldquo;Why hang it,&rdquo; said Harbord, &ldquo;the <i>buoys</i> are
all wrong.&rdquo; And sure enough they were. The dockyard had laid
every line of buoys in a wrong position as compared with the chart. Not
only was it my turn to do the chuckling, but the Admiral, to signify
his annoyance with the dockyard, sent for the <i>Harvey</i>, the big
survey ship, and made them take a survey of the whole creek and shift
every buoy; whilst I felt my halo increase by a good couple of
inches.</p>

<p>About this time London was getting it badly from Zepps. We knew
quite well when they were coming over, but so far had been totally
unable to prevent them discharging their load of bombs, as, when, and
where they wished. Periodically, we of the N.D.F. would get the
&ldquo;Executive Signal&rdquo; and dash off to take up our respective
positions in the estuary of the Thames, in hopes of sighting them.</p>

<p>My pitch was just round the Tongue Lightship, and one such night,
after getting &ldquo;Raid Stations&rdquo; I blinded out to my position
and told the Lightship to put up a small riding light (Her regulation
light being a thing of long past.) But a little glimmer would just
enable us to keep station and concentrate on listening, instead of
dodging sandbanks.</p>

<p>Amongst my signalmen I had a chap who had the most extraordinarily
acute hearing. I&rsquo;ve known him to hear and describe sounds quite
outside the ken of anyone on board. I told Number One--in other words
the First Lieutenant&mdash;to put him on the bridge with nothing else
to do but to keep his ears open. Let him sit down, stand up or go where
he pleased; for if we were going to have any chance at one of these
blighters, we should have to hear him first. All things set; a Tracer
in the breech of our one and only anti-aircraft gun, ship just stemming
the tide, and I slipped down into my cabin. Not ten minutes later and
the Gunner was shouting down the hatchway in a hoarse whisper,
&ldquo;Zeppelin right overhead, sir.&rdquo; Up on deck like a shot I
went, but coming up out of the light, I could see nothing. &ldquo;There
he is, sir,&rdquo; said the Gunner excitedly, pointing straight up, and
there sure enough he was; so close as to blot out the sky, and so
directly overhead that the anti-aircraft gun would not bear. In those
days they only came within a few degrees of the absolute perpendicular.
Everyone in the excitement of the moment had adopted a whisper, for
fear we should be heard, I suppose, though what chance there was of
that with the row his engines were making, heaven only knows. Calling
for the engineer, I told him to give her what steam he could without
touching his fires, in case a spark should scare the Zepp away. Slowly
we drew out, whilst No. 1 of the gun, with his eyes glued on the
telescope waited for the gun sights to &ldquo;come on.&rdquo; Everyone
was holding their breath, whilst the propeller slowly churned
round.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d given the order &ldquo;Action&rdquo; which the Gunner had
supplemented with &ldquo;Fire when your sights come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last, &ldquo;Sights are on, sir,&rdquo; and before the words were
out of his mouth, <i>bang!</i> and away went the first tracer with its
little trail of fire. &ldquo;Over. Down fifty. Fire!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hit!&rdquo; yelled everyone as the tracer went clean through the
Zepp&rsquo;s tail. He was now trying his utmost to get out of range.
&ldquo;Independent,&rdquo; yelled the Gunner, and away with another
bang goes the next shell. &ldquo;Hit again,&rdquo; reports the
Gunner.</p>

<p>How on earth we didn&rsquo;t set him on fire and bring him down,
heaven alone knows. Just absolute rotten bad luck.</p>

<p>Then <i>he</i> tried to get <i>us</i> and at the same time lighten
himself by dropping his bombs, for there was no doubt that he was badly
hit. Another shot gets him and he dips sharply by the tail.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming down,&rdquo; shouts everyone, now thoroughly
worked up. But he wasn&rsquo;t. Down came a rain of bombs instead, all
exploding as they hit the water, like a Brock&rsquo;s benefit and
Crystal Palace show rolled into one. He&rsquo;d had enough of it, and
was throwing everything overboard, in a frantic effort to escape. By
the flash from our gun, he saw where the shots were coming from; so he
turned his tail towards us, giving, in the darkness, an impossible
target. In the end, he managed to get away.</p>

<p>But London was spared that little lot. I was given the D.S.C. whilst
our friend Zepp, went back and reported having &ldquo;Sunk a destroyer
in the mouth of the Thames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was then promoted to the one and only Dover Patrol. I&rsquo;m
afraid I did not appreciate the honour, and kicked about the shift;
just when I was nicely settled in the N.D.F. with my family housed at
Minster (on the mud!)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I fully realise what it meant to be singled out for a
Destroyer of the Dover Patrol?&rdquo; etc., etc., in the very best
naval circumstance and style. Well, no, I certainly did not, but
&ldquo;orders was orders&rdquo; and I might as well get on with the
job.</p>

<p>So, once more, the family packed its grip, and moved along to No. 8,
East Cliff, Dover, whilst I reported to the H.Q. and was greeted as
follows:--</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, Lightoller. Well, you are of course appointed to the
<i>Falcon</i>. She&rsquo;s over in Dunkirk working up the Belgian
Coast. Carry on, please.&rdquo; With which full, complete information
and instructions I was introduced to the intricacies of the Dover
Patrol.</p>

<p>The first thing was to find something to convey me across Channel.
The Duty Destroyer filled the bill there, landing me in Dunkirk late
that evening. I soon spotted a neat little craft lying alongside one of
those contraptions of modern warfare&mdash;a 13 in. Monitor. The little
craft was H.M.S. <i>Falcon</i>, of a type commonly known as the
&ldquo;30 knotters.&rdquo; Not a great deal of space, unencumbered by
guns and torpedo tubes, but palatial, particularly below decks,
compared with the Torpedo Boat I had just left. A fair sized wardroom,
and best of all, my own cabin to sulk in.</p>

<p>After the usual formalities of taking over from the previous Captain
had been got through, the next thing was to try and get to know my own
crew. Rightly or wrongly I always like to size up each man individually
for myself. Furthermore I had a strong objection to the splendid
isolation usually enjoyed by the Captain of H.M. Ships. Not through any
particular desire to rip up hoary naval traditions, but the times being
what they were, to my mind a unit was nearer her peak of fighting
efficiency when there was confidence and close touch throughout the
ship. This applies more, perhaps to a Destroyer (particularly when on
more or less special service, as we were) than on a big ship, where
everything must be based just on routine&mdash;though frankly I think a
lot of said routine could be dispensed with without any loss of
fighting efficiency.</p>

<p>The fact that I leaned pretty solidly on experience gained through
long service in the Mercantile Marine, led to some comical patches at
odd times. For one thing, I expected each man to think for himself,
and, in an emergency, to act for himself. For instance, all the guns
were kept loaded with just the handle of the breech mechanism lever
withdrawn just sufficiently to break contact with the striker. To bring
the gun into action, all a man had to do, was to push the lever home,
and press the firing trigger. The idea being that if at any moment, a
submarine, or, what was more likely, a periscope, broke the surface,
the man who spotted her&mdash;and he was just as likely to be one of
the hands round the decks as one of the proper lookouts&mdash;would
swing the nearest gun, roughly in that direction, push home the B.M.
lever, and fire. This, instead of the recognized method of dashing to
the Officer of the Watch, and making his report to the bridge, and by
the time the report had made its round the submarine was down again in
the vasty deep.</p>

<p>The effect of a man jumping to the nearest gun and firing, was that
the whole ship was instantly on the alert; everyone, including the
O.O.W. heard the shot, and he dashed to that side of the bridge,
knowing at once that a sub. had been sighted, and by the fall of shot
he knew the direction in which it had been seen. All this was
encompassed in just a couple of seconds of time.</p>

<p>Although this terrible departure from Naval customs distressed many
of the R.N. officers and petty officers, they had, in the long run, to
admit that it achieved its object, by instantly concentrating
everybody&rsquo;s sight and sense on one certain spot of water. The
only man who would never admit the slightest element of good in the
scheme was the wardroom steward; but he was prejudiced through unwisely
standing too near the breech of a six-pounder, when one of the stokers
loosed off, at what later turned out to be a porpoise. The steward got
the breech of the gun in the small of his back, which successfully
knocked out all the wind, and what little sense he had.</p>

<p>The Patrol&rsquo;s ordinary job was, of course, to hold the Straits.
Our secondary job was to journey up the Belgian coast and annoy the
ubiquitous Hun; at the same time protecting the left flank of the
British Army, which by now, rested on the sand dunes not far from
Dunkirk itself.</p>

<p>To protect our ships, whilst on patrol, from attack by submarine
from shoreward, there was a long line of mined nets. The Destroyers, in
addition to forming a screen for the big ships, had to keep an eye on
those nets, and light special acetylene lamps on Dan Buoys, so that our
own submarines could navigate with a degree of reasonable safety at
night.</p>

<p>Periodically, the whole Flotilla would indulge in exchanging a bit
of hate with the shore batteries. By way of return, the German
Destroyers would raid us. But this was usually at night time when the
big Monitors were in the harbour. The latter&rsquo;s 13 and 15 in. guns
were just a bit too heavy for them, though they did work out a very
successful scheme to annoy us, when there was not enough water for the
Monitors to get inside the harbour. They evolved what we called an
Electric Motor Boat, commonly known as an EMB. These were driven by
internal combustion, and directed electrically from the shore by a wire
attached to the boat. In the stern was a reel of wire miles long which
supplied direction. An aeroplane formed the guiding star and gave
directions by wireless back to the station ashore. In the bows, the
E.M.B. carried a high explosive charge and traveled at some thirty
knots. In consequence it was almost impossible to hit her. With us
Destroyers we could always get out of the way, by either heaving up, if
there was time, or slipping our cables if there wasn&rsquo;t. With the
unwieldy Monitors it was another matter, for they could neither slip,
nor move quickly enough to dodge. The result was, they would see the
feather of foam (which was all that could be seen of the E.M.B.), and
then they promptly loosed off with every gun they possessed, with every
hope, but little prospect, of registering a hit. Of course, the Monitor
had its blister, or bulge, round the water line, so there was really no
fear of her being actually sunk. But, as in one case, the E.M.B. came
charging along, everybody blazing away with really more danger to
themselves than the precious boat&mdash;and hit the
<i>Terror&rsquo;s</i> blister a glancing blow, leapt clean up and out
of the water, exploding on her upper works. No small amount of damage
ensued. Forthwith written suggestions were called for from all the
Captains of the Dover Patrol, working up the Belgian Coast, as to the
best manner of dealing with this &ldquo;menace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those boats were absolutely devoted to speed, and, as I knew,
carried no skeg, which as a rule protects the propeller from anything
in the water, a bit of wood, rope, or such like. They traveled at an
angle of almost 30&ordm; tail down and nose up. That was how this one
came to jump the <i>Terror&rsquo;s</i> blister, and blow in her upper
works. Well, gunfire having proved utterly ineffective, I &ldquo;had
the honour to suggest&rdquo; that as a Destroyer was supplied with one
grass line forward and another aft, each said Destroyer should, on
sighting an attacking E.M.B., bend the two grass lines together and
trail them astern, placing them directly across the course of the
oncoming E.M.B. She might, by smart handling, have missed the first,
but I&rsquo;ll guarantee she was bound to run over the second, and a
few dozen turns of two inch grass line round the prop would quickly put
paid to her little joy ride.</p>

<p>I was thanked, very courteously, but informed at the same time that
&ldquo;the method to be adopted must be concentrated gunfire.&rdquo; I
wasn&rsquo;t altogether surprised, being, by this year of
grace&mdash;and War&mdash;fairly familiar with Navy traditions and
Tape. The grass line was obviously too silly and simple.</p>

<p>However, our side soon retaliated with the C.M.B.&mdash;short for
Coastal Motor Boat. These were real boats and carried a crew of four.
Two engineers, two officers and a twenty-two inch mouldy (torpedo).
They had a speed of anything up to thirty-five knots, and later in the
war reached forty-five. Originally they were based on Harwich, but not
allowed to do anything worth while. Many might wonder why. Well, the
story oft told, said that what the Navy couldn&rsquo;t do, no one else
was going to get a chance of doing&mdash;and collecting kudos! Be that
as it may, the High Lights in the C.M.B. world worried the Higher
Lights till, in desperation, they sent a Flotilla round to
Dover&mdash;much to Admiral Bacon&rsquo;s disgust. He promptly pushed
them over on to &ldquo;Commodore Dunkirk,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s how
this collection of splendid fellows with their wonderful boats, came to
be based on Dunkirk, using the Destroyers as chummy ships.</p>

<p>Some of their efforts up the coast were epics. They got the
Commodore&mdash;a real sport&mdash;to send a bombing squadron of
aeroplanes up the Zeebrugge. It was well-known that apart from
submarines, a division of German Destroyers was also based there, and
in the case of a raid on Zeebrugge the latter invariably put quietly
out to sea, till the flap was over. Then, as quietly returned. All this
was common knowledge, but when the bright young sparks of C.M.B. fame,
heard of it, they said, &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s a hell of a fine
chance. Turn us loose.&rdquo; The Commodore, like a good fellow, sent
up four bombers to drive out the Destroyers and then turned the
C.M.B.&rsquo;s loose, who promptly sunk one Destroyer, and put another
out of action; all in one perfectly good night&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>A C.M.B., in effect, was nothing more than a glorified hydroplane,
decked-in forward over the engines. Aft she sloped away to the transoms
in two complete sections, leaving a lateral gap between. In this gap
reposed a twenty-one inch torpedo, with its business end facing
forward, propellers and rudders aft.</p>

<p>Fitted over the nose in the warhead of the mouldy, was the cup end
of a compressed air ram. On pressing the firing key, the ram forced the
torpedo along her slides to the rear and into the water. The action of
the torpedo striking the water actuated the trigger, which, in turn,
opened the compressed air chamber to the propellors, and at the same
time elevated the diving rudders. The net result was that sufficient
time having elapsed for the C.M.B. to get clear, the torpedo then shot
forward on a course identical to that on which the C.M.B. had been
traveling when the firing key was pressed.</p>

<p>These boats must therefore steer straight at their objective until
they were well within torpedo range; then fire,--and do their best to
get away. Even under the cover of night, they needed a modicum of luck
to get out of gun range without being hit&mdash;once they had been
spotted.</p>

<p>It can&rsquo;t be denied that some of these boats did have a spot of
luck at times. On one such occasion, just as one chap had loosed off
his mouldy and put his helm hard over to pull out of the scrum, his
port tiller wire broke. The only thing he could do was to put the helm
hard over the other way with the remaining wire, and jam the rudder
against the stern to keep it quiet, whilst he&mdash;the
Skipper&mdash;leaned over the stern and repaired the offending wire.
Meantime his craft was gong all out, some thirty knots, circling round
and round. One part of each circle took him clean through the objects
of their kind attention&mdash;the Division of German
Destroyers&mdash;who by way of return loosed off impartially, with
everything, even including revolvers, for he passed some of them within
fifty yards, yet not one of the crew was hit, nor the engine, nor any
other vital part. The skipper hitched up the wire, got away, and she
returned home, none the worse, beyond a few punctures above the water
line.</p>

<p>Another time a chap having let go his mouldy and turned; was making
back, when the oil-feed pump broke down, and the engine instantly
seized up. They were still within sight, even though it was night, so
the nearest Destroyer commenced lobbing salvoes of four inch shells at
them. First salvo &ldquo;over,&rdquo; next one &ldquo;short.&rdquo;
Another &ldquo;over,&rdquo; and so the game went on, whilst the
engineers and officers merely sat under the fore deck, alongside the
engine, waiting for the cylinders to cool down sufficiently for them to
start up again.</p>

<p>Between them and the four inch high explosive shells was exactly
half an inch of perfectly good mahogany.</p>

<p>Once the engine cooled, they were all right, as they were supplied
with an auxiliary oil feed. But, meantime, they listened to the shells
either whining overhead, or crumping short, sometimes heaving sprays
right over the boat. Eventually they also got their engine going, and
came away, not a penny the worse.</p>

<p>All the boats were not so lucky, and as time went on an occasional
one, here and there did not return. In fact the German Destroyers were
not a great while before they discovered a method which effectually put
a stop to these little night excursions. We never knew exactly what
their practice was, but the evidence was clear, by the increasing
number that failed to report. Finally the Commodore called the circus
off.</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t to be supposed that the German Destroyer chaps took
these attacks lying down. They retaliated by raiding the Straits again
and again, and their method of attack made it very difficult for us to
locate them. Usually they worked with a division of four modern ships
mounting 4.2 guns. (The Grand Fleet collared all our modern Destroyers,
so we had to make out as best we could.) The Germans would come down,
when there was no moon and tear up and down the Straits, sinking
everything on sight. Trawlers, Drifters, Destroyers, or anything else
that came within their ken. Their practice was, on anything being
sighted by the leading ship, to instantly pass the word down the line,
keeping their own sights &ldquo;on&rdquo; till the fourth ship picked
up the prospective quarry and fired. The other three pressed their
triggers at the same instant. The result was one solid salvo of sixteen
or twenty guns and then blank darkness again.</p>

<p>Unless one was near and actually looking that way, it was impossible
to get a bearing, for they never fired again at that
object&mdash;usually there was not need. Over went their helms, and off
on another tack. Then another flash, in a totally different direction,
and still another of the Dover Patrol had paid the price.</p>

<p>A drifter had been put down in this manner one night, and H.M.S.
<i>Fairey</i> (Destroyer of our Flotilla) seeing the flash and hearing
the report, dashed off in that direction to discover some half a dozen
men struggling in the water. He&rsquo;d got it fixed in his own mind
that the explosion had been a mine, and switched on his searchlight to
help him see, and rescue the survivors. The Huns, of course, spotted
him at once, and after swinging round, came up on his blind side and
gave him a salvo also. Only one man out of the crews of both ships was
saved.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h3>

<h4>THOSE DAMNED &ldquo;R&rdquo; WORDS</h4>

<p>Up to this time we had been patrolling the Straits singly and
independently, but it became a distinctly losing game. So someone had a
brainstorm and instituted the &ldquo;R&rdquo; words. Every two hours
day and night, two words commencing with R were sent out on our wave
length. There were also two executive words commencing with R and
changed every twenty-four hours, and known only to the Captain. Just
imagine how automatically one&rsquo;s reply became to the
signalman&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Rodosto Renoun, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Repulse
Retreat, sir,&rdquo; Revenge Remand, sir,&rdquo; and so on, day in, day
out and night after night. As often as not the words would be reported
just when one&rsquo;s mind was more than fully occupied with something
else.</p>

<p>If and when the executive words did come, all Destroyers
rendezvoused at given places in the Straits and formed up into
Divisions ready to tackle the wily Hun with <i>something</i>
approaching his own weight in metal. The rendezvous of my particular
Division was at a position called Y buoy over on the French side, a
place I am not likely to forget in a hurry, for I left the best part of
two perfectly good propellers there, but of that later.</p>

<p>The night I got into trouble with the &ldquo;R&rdquo; words, as luck
would have it, Brother Bosche, of the ever fertile mind, had chosen for
one of his star turns.</p>

<p>In the first place he was going to carry out one of his well
advertised raids on the Straits, and when he had drawn us off after
that herring, he proposed landing&mdash;or demonstrating a
landing&mdash;on the sand dunes behind the left flank of our Army. Not
only did &ldquo;Intelligence&rdquo; know of the raid, but they also
knew that it was a bluff&mdash;but we poor skippers of Destroyers knew
not.</p>

<p>The Hun, without a doubt knew his bluff had been called, when our
submarine patrol, on the line of mined nets was cancelled for the
night, and in the fading twilight there trickled out of Dunkirk Harbour
one 15-inch monitor, two 13-inchers, a couple of 9-inchers, sweepers
and destroyers. This lot soon formed up, with sweepers out ahead and
the accompanying screen of destroyers hovering around endeavouring to
keep station, zigzag and yet not lose sight of the big ship they were
attached to. The <i>Wolfe</i> was our misfortune, and the skipper of
her was a pretty bleak sort of being. Of course, it was my own fault; I
should have been on the top line with those infernal words, but it had
been no small job to avoid some sort of snotty signal from the
<i>Wolfe</i> about something done or left undone.</p>

<p>Heaven knows, there were opportunities enough to give cause for
those sort of signals, and this blighter never seemed to miss one. I
can only suppose that it was during one of those cheering interludes,
that the signalman must have come with his Remumbo Rejumbo, or whatever
the executive words were that night, and I had or hadn&rsquo;t said,
&ldquo;All right, signalman.&rdquo; Anyhow, the next thing was, we got
the shaded &ldquo;M.K.&rdquo; from our friend of the torpid liver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M.K.&rdquo;, translated, means &ldquo;Proceed in execution of
previous orders,&rdquo; in other words &ldquo;Shove off.&rdquo; Well,
we shoved off, hard aport, full speed, whilst I tried to collect my
scattered senses. It was pitch dark, and no sign of another destroyer
who might have given me the tip. &ldquo;Number one, what do you suppose
the M.K.was made for? Number one hadn&rsquo;t the remotest idea, nor
had anyone else, for by this time I had taught them all to use their
own individual thinkboxes.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to ignominiously return and
&ldquo;Request further instructions,&rdquo; in other words, to ask for
it. And we got it! &ldquo;Take station astern,&rdquo; was the signal.
Dirty dog! He wouldn&rsquo;t even give me a hint. With our tail tucked
neatly between our legs, we crawled along astern. Suddenly, with a
blast of intelligence, &ldquo;Signalman,&rdquo; I yelled as loudly as I
dared, &ldquo;What were the last of those damned &lsquo;R&rsquo; words
you gave me,&rdquo; and sure enough they were the Executive words by
all that was holy and I had slipped up on them. &ldquo;Signalman, make
the interrogative M.K.,&rdquo; meaning, &ldquo;<i>Request</i>
permission to proceed in execution of previous orders.&rdquo; Back came
the reply, &ldquo;Approved,&rdquo; and no rider, for a wonder.
&ldquo;Hard aport,&rdquo; once again, and &ldquo;Every ounce of steam
you can give her down below, there.&rdquo; Sandbanks on one side, and
mine nets on the other. (Eight knots was a safe speed, we were making
twenty-five.) No matter, we <i>must</i> make Y buoy in time. At all
costs we must not let our Division down.</p>

<p>What added a certain amount of zest to our midnight blind was the
fact that only a few days before the <i>Gypsy</i>, another of the
Flotilla had been making a similar dash in daytime, and had made a
collection of some of those nets with her prop. She was towed in, later
on, and put in Graving dock. Shores had been placed, and the water was
just leaving her when it was discovered, by the then scattering crowd
of dockies, that she had a nice little bunch of grapes hanging, all
entangled, from her props. The grapes, in this instance, being mines,
still attached to bits of net.</p>

<p>We had no ambition to collect either nets or mines, and in point of
fact didn&rsquo;t, but in due course, &ldquo;made our numbers&rdquo; to
the Senior Officer of our Division.</p>

<p>Off we went hunting the hoary Hun; a job every man jack preferred to
dancing attendance on the snotty old <i>Wolfe</i>.</p>

<p>He was out that night, all right, but we couldn&rsquo;t make contact
with him. Blindman&rsquo;s buff is not an odds on game, with the coast
of England and France for boundaries. Maybe he sensed we were after his
hide, or perhaps he had been told to play a bluff. Anyhow he returned
to his lair with an empty bag that good night.</p>

<p>Later on, the usual signal came through, &ldquo;Resume normal
conditions,&rdquo; which again translated means &ldquo;get on with your
various jobs.&rdquo; Ours was to get back to Dunkirk, and coil down,
preparatory to the next jaunt up the coast.</p>

<p>Dunkirk itself was no health resort in these times. At night the
Germans sent their bombers over, and by daylight, with all the
impudence in the world, their tame photographers to take record of the
wreckage.</p>

<p>Often and often, after a night of strafing, when bombs had been
dropping everywhere, and great gouts of flame going up, accompanied by
crash after crash, one would think, &ldquo;Well there will be no
Dunkirk when the day breaks after <i>this</i> little lot.&rdquo; But no
such thing. A couple of lamp-posts down, and a few windows broken would
be the sum total of damage. The inhabitants, in fact, made a
well-earned boast that during the whole time, the tram service was
never once held up on account of raids. Brother Hun tried very hard to
get the Commodore&rsquo;s office, in return for his little efforts with
the C.M.B.&rsquo;s, but though time and again he had to have the
windows replaced, then never managed to get a direct hit. Certainly
they compelled him to give up using glass and resort to wood in the
window frames, that did not stop the good work going on.</p>

<p>Sometimes to vary the nightly programme, the Air Force would place
landing lights on the beach, and encourage the wily Hun to bomb them.
He did, and then would take bearings from the landing lights and turn
his attention to the town&mdash;as he thought; but owing to the
misplaced lights, he put his bombs into the inner harbour where we lay,
which was not so good. He caught the destroyer ahead of us one night
with a bomb under his stern, which, though it sank him by the
stern&mdash;by a stroke of luck&mdash;did not set off his depth
charges. If they had gone off, we should all have gone up. Another
target he tried hard for, was the ammunition ship tied to the inner
dock. She was loaded with 15, 13 and 12-inch shells, and was a
continued source of annoyance to the inhabitants of Dunkirk, for if
they had hit the ship, the whole town would have shifted.</p>

<p>The Captain and crew of the ammunition ship took their risk in a
curiously philosophical way. Briefly, their argument was,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference between sitting on one, or one
hundred H.E. shells&mdash;be they five or fifteen inch, if either you
or the ship is hit? The result is the same anyway.&rdquo; I suppose
they were right, when you look at it that way.</p>

<p>Every day, one destroyer was told off for &ldquo;Cross Channel
Duty,&rdquo; with dispatches and so forth, for or from Dover. In fine
weather, this was always the best job, as it let one out from the
everlasting patrolling at comparatively slow speeds in company with the
Monitors. Crossing Channel, there was always the chance of having a few
shots at mines floating about or a possible strafe with a submarine.
The Straits were strewn with the former, and it was good sport trying
to hit them in a seaway. If they were British, then it was quite safe
to go close up, despite orders to the contrary, and sink them at close
range. I only knew one to ever explode. Even then, it only sent the
ring of the cap whirling in the air. This so resembled a man throwing
his own cap in the air, that the whole Watch, viewing the affair from
our decks, just cheered to a man, on the impulse. If, on the other
hand, it was a German mine, you opened fire and kept at a respectful
distance, it was not advisable to take liberties with those chaps.</p>

<p>After the close shave I had up the Belgian coast, through messing up
things through missing the &ldquo;R&rdquo; words, I took Number one and
the Yeoman of Signals into my confidence, and shared the secret words.
Orders or no orders about utter secrecy, I was taking no more risks,
and I slept sounder in consequence. The result was that one night, some
weeks later, after the endless repetition of two hourly &ldquo;R&rdquo;
words, we suddenly got the Executive again.</p>

<p>This time our luck was in and we caught our wily friend, and gave
him a good trouncing. His report was that he had suffered no damage,
whereas on the other hand, he had sunk two British Destroyers. This was
not exactly correct, though we did get two badly damaged. Still, not by
any means sunk, they both got back into the harbour. One was torpedoed
in the stern and with the other the best part of her bows gone. The
former was the <i>Zulu</i>, and the latter the Nubian. With unlooked
for economy, the Dockyard cut each in two, and as they were sister
ships, joined the forward end of one to the after end of the other and
with unexpected humour, called the result H.M.S. <i>Zubian</i>.</p>

<p>Dover harbour, after Dunkirk, was Peacehaven, even though there were
few moonless nights when the place was not raided and bombed. One of
the worst occasions started in broad daylight, at Folkestone, where the
Canadian troops were in camp. It was the afternoon of a very fine day,
and we were out on the Channel Patrol, which included Dover and
Folkestone. I had taken over the bridge in the afternoon, and sent the
Officer of the Watch down for a smoke, when there was a big splash
thrown up, right close alongside. I naturally thought I must be fouling
some big-gun range, but I had no notification of anything of the kind
and therefore it was their fault if they hit us. Another splash. Then,
being quite close in shore, I could see huge columns of earth being
thrown up in the air, very close around where the Canadian Camp should
be. The next minute our look-out reported, &ldquo;Enemy aeroplanes
overhead,&rdquo; and sure enough they were. A dozen or more Gothas had
come overland and tackled the Canadian Camp. Seeing us they thought
they would have a go at us as well. Then one of our Blimps came sailing
placidly along, having been recalled to her hangar. She couldn&rsquo;t
see the Gothas above her and, as her Commander told me later, he
couldn&rsquo;t understand what on earth I was trying to do, blazing
away, as he thought, at him. Actually I was trying to beat off the Huns
who, by now, had turned their attention to the Blimp.</p>

<p>Next they paid a visit to Dover, and then I did spend an anxious
half an hour or so for my wife and kiddies were there, almost exactly
under where the damned Huns were dropping the last of their bombs,
spotting and dropping at their leisure. Our anti-aircraft defences were
not what they might have been.</p>

<p>I found out later that my wife had been sitting on the verandah when
the fun started, and there she remained, quite unperturbed, with a
pencil and a bit of paper, spotting the shots from our batteries. To
their everlasting credit, let it be said, that they did bring down two
of the blighters.</p>

<p>Summer time in the Dover Patrol was not bad tack, as the war went.
For one thing we could pretty well be sure of supplementing our larder
now and then with fish. The Admiral had two trawlers working for the
Staff, and we used to keep a bright lookout for them coming in with
their catch. We were always sure of twenty or thirty pounds of fish in
exchange for a bit of tobacco. Sometimes we would get a few of on our
own by putting down a small charge, one day with amazing luck. It was
just alongside the Varne Shoal, we fired a sixteen and a quarter pound
charge of guncotton and raised well over two tons of cod. When we saw
them coming up stunned it was &ldquo;Away all boats.&rdquo; Actually we
got on board a ton and a quarter, and we must have missed twice that
amount through them coming to and swimming off. Naturally we thought we
had happened on the home of all cod, and in consequence, I &ldquo;fell
in&rdquo; the hands and swore them to secrecy. But what was the use. We
distributed the fish to the whole of the flotillas and, of course,
everyone wanted to know where we had got the catch. The secret,
naturally, leaked out, as everyone had a special chum on some ship, who
in turn imparted the information to his Skipper, the consequence was
that everyone was seeing a &ldquo;submarine off the Varne Shoal,&rdquo;
so that between us we nearly blew the blame shoal away.</p>

<p>There were submarines in plenty so everyone had good excuse. Now and
again someone succeeded in nailing one, but it was fairly rare. One
night a chap had the audacity to come up and shell Dover. Another time
they bagged one of our own submarines, set to watch the Gate in the
line of nets stretching across the Straits; which just shows their
knowledge of what was going on. They were not even supposed to know of
the Gate in the nets, let alone the submarine set to watch. They did
though, and came down, as I have said and torpedoed the poor devil. We
tried mining some of the routes they fancied. One of these was around
the Gravelines buoy a little west of Dunkirk. Our Layers put down a
triangular minefield with the Gravelines buoy at the apex and the Haut
Frond (sic) buoy in the center. The Germans with their warped idea of
humour, came in and laid another exactly alongside it, and thereby
trumped our trick. In the end we actually had to remove ours altogether
as in the end it became more harmful to us than the enemy.<br>
</p>

<hr><a name="ch40"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER FORTY</h3>

<h4>BLUNDERING THROUGH A MINEFIELD</h4>

<p>Before our minefield was actually removed, we in the <i>Falcon</i>
went through it.</p>

<p>It happened this way. Another Destroyer and ourselves had been doing
Escort Duty for Troopships across to Boulogne and had finished for the
day at Folkestone. Then we had to make the best of our way back to
Dunkirk, ready for the next day&rsquo;s duty.</p>

<p>It was pretty obvious that we were going to have fog, and a thick
one; in fact, it was already shutting down as the last transport got
into Folkestone. The question was, should we shove off and try making
Dunkirk with the possibility of a night in, or take the safer course
and ask permission to moor up in Dover. There was no doubt whatever of
permission being readily granted, in view of the weather conditions.
But I knew full well that if during the night it should clear
up&mdash;and quite likely it would&mdash;we should get the pertly
authoritative &ldquo;M.K.&rdquo; and have to shove off forthwith.</p>

<p>We were Senior Ship so I had to make the decision.</p>

<p>Well, I made up my mind I was going to try for Dunkirk and the night
in, but the <i>Racehorse</i> could please herself. I would not hoist
the &ldquo;One Pennant A,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;Form Line
Ahead,&rdquo; or in other words a definite order for him to take
station astern. I gave him a compass signal which merely indicated what
course I was intending to steer and the speed, viz. twenty knots. He
could then make his choice as to whether he would take a chance and
follow us, or go into Dover.</p>

<p>Frankly, I did not think he would come, so jumped right off into the
fog at twenty knots as I was a bit surprised to see him a little later
loom up astern, having picked up our wake and followed it up till he
sighted us.</p>

<p>Two fools instead of one!</p>

<p>We must steer straight for Calais, this being the only reasonable
course. Make Calais Green buoy, a mile off shore and then turn up along
the coast and try, as best we could, to strike the entrance to the
Gravelines Channel, between the side of the minefield and the shore. It
would have been utterly crazy to have tried to strike the channel at an
angle, on a straight line from Folkestone, as we then should, a
thousand to one, either misjudge and run into the minefield, or overrun
and hit the beach, which at the best of times is low and difficult to
see. We calculated most carefully the exact time it would take us at 20
knots from the Folkestone Gate to Calais Green buoy; also the course
and then let her go&mdash;trusting to a considerable element of luck
not to ram anything meanwhile. If we ran our time and distance to the
buoy, that should bring us a mile off shore and allow us exactly three
minutes to come and go on, before she was due to pile up.</p>

<p>Time up, and still no buoy in sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her run for a minute and three-quarters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That brought us within 500 yards of the beach, and heading for it at
20 knots.</p>

<p>Quite near enough, so immediately the 105 seconds was up and still
no sign of the buoy, over went the helm, hard a starboard and up she
came on to the course for Gravelines buoy, which we ought shortly to
make on the port bow.</p>

<p>Time up again and no Gravelines Pile Buoy. Another half minute and I
would show down and take a sounding.</p>

<p>Suddenly the gunner called out &ldquo;There she is, sir,&rdquo; and
sure enough, there was the big Pile Buoy, but <i>red</i> instead of
<i>black</i>. Number One was the first to spot the color and growled,
&ldquo;By God, it&rsquo;s not Gravelines, it&rsquo;s Haut Frond,&rdquo;
it was indeed, and we were just exactly in the middle of the minefield
that had so successfully blown up five of our own ships already. All
the officers were on the bridge and pretty well all hands on or around
the decks, so everyone saw where we were and knew full what the chances
were. We kept on at the 20 knots (it was the only thing to do) but
brought her slowly round so as to disturb the mines as little as
possible, till she was on the bearing for the Dyck Lightship; and then,
just held our breath.</p>

<p>Would she go up or would she come through?</p>

<p>I stood facing aft to watch if the <i>Racehorse</i> went up, which
to my mind would have been a worse catastrophe than gong up ourselves,
for I had led her into it.</p>

<p>The relief when at last we sighted the Dyck and the still greater
relief as the <i>Racehorse</i> swung round in our wake into the
channel, can well be imagined. We were all right now and would get our
valued &ldquo;night in&rdquo; in our bunks. Having made fast in Dunkirk
with the <i>Racehorse</i> alongside, Welch, the Skipper of her, came on
board to have dinner with me. &ldquo;Damn good course you made,
Lightoller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes? See all the buoys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All except Calais Green,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see Gravelines?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Of course</i>, you went round it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I then told him, &ldquo;We went round Haut Frond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared for a second, as the full meaning sank in and then, with a
world of expression, just said, &ldquo;Oh, Hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently we were not meant to add our names to the many who are
represented by the memorials standing to-day, one on each side of the
Channel. Silent testimony to the many brave fellows who played and
lost. My own hat comes off, more especially, to the crews of the
trawlers and drifters in the Dover Patrol. They were continually raided
by Huns armed with the very latest guns, 4-2&rsquo;s, fifteen to a
salvo against the drifter&rsquo;s puny little 6-pounder. Why, they
hadn&rsquo;t the proverbial cat&rsquo;s chance. Even we destroyer chaps
had little enough chance when we came up against a division of those
modern Destroyers. But then we had some sort of armament to hit back
with and anyway it was our specific job. Not so with the trawler and
drifter men, they were just like sitting hens and the Huns deserved
about the credit a sportsman would get in like circumstances.</p>

<p>However, we managed at last to put a stop to both the above and
below water raids by instituting Lightships burning flares of three
million candle power, at irregular intervals. These lit up the whole
Straits. Added to this, we mined the Straits at varying depths, so that
no submarine could venture below the surface at all. If she was on the
surface when one of these lights went off, then she <i>must</i> dive,
or be sunk by gunfire. If she dived, it was merely the worst choice of
two evils, for she was almost certain to touch off one of the
mines.</p>

<p>It effectually put a stop to their activities in the Straits of
Dover and from then on the strain eased up considerably.</p>

<p>The Straits, from a weather point of view, is one of the very worst
places in the world for a ship of the Destroyer type. The seas are just
big enough for her to make the worst possible weather in the worst
possible kind of sea. Actually it is the tremendous current that makes
the sea so bad. I have seen the <i>Falcon</i> burying herself right up
to the bridge, when only making about four knots. On some crossings a
hand had to be stationed on the telegraphs all the time and the utmost
speed we dared make at any time was three or four knots. Frequently I
have had to stop and even then she would hardly ride up to those huge,
wall-sided seas. I&rsquo;ve had bad weather on the Atlantic and driven
hard into it year after year, but I can safely say, even that was
sometimes child&rsquo;s play compared with what we had to contend with,
during some of the S.W. gales in the Straits.</p>

<p>Those who had had Atlantic experience stood it best. Many of those
who had not, simply cracked up. With the Skipper of one Destroyer, his
hair went completely white.</p>

<p>Winter was naturally, much the worst and often I have come off the
bridge after one of these nights and had to wash off with warm water,
the thick crusted salt, that had gathered round my eyes during the
night. If you rub any of that sea salt into your eyes, you certainly do
know all about it. Having got rid of the thick of the salt one then
proceeds to thaw out; for even with thick underclothes, a heavy suit
and a suit of Duffle over all, the cold pierces through. You can go on
the bridge at dusk all nicely dry and every stitch individually warmed,
yet by about three a.m. the cold has got through everything and from
then on till daybreak one gets steadily colder and stiffer.</p>

<p>I had two and a half years with the <i>Falcon</i> in the Patrol and
though I enjoyed them, I think they were two of the hardest of my life.
Even in the harbour of Dover, there was no rest day or night with a
S.W. gale.</p>

<p><br>
 Whoever the bright boys were who designed that harbour and
breakwaters, they certainly had not the remotest relation to sailors.
If they had merely consulted anyone of the Cross Channel skippers
<i>and taken his advice</i>, the harbour would not have been the
ghastly failure it has since proved. Open, as it is to a S.W. gale, no
small craft can lie there with the slightest degree of comfort. The
tide has been allowed to sweep across the entrance, so that big ships
cannot enter except at stated times and of course, mail boats (for
which it was designed) cannot wait for these times. The net result is
that it has been practically abandoned. Even Destroyers with all their
immense engine power and ability to man&oelig;uvre, often found the
utmost difficulty in picking up their moorings and making fast to the
buoys. Many a time they would have to give it up and anchor in the
Downs.<br>
</p>

<hr><a name="ch41"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</h3>

<h4>SCROUNGING LEAVE</h4>

<p>The Destroyer Flotillas in Dover were always kept at &ldquo;Five
minutes notice,&rdquo; which meant they must be prepared to slip their
respective buoys within five minutes of getting the M.K. The custom
throughout the Flotillas was to keep everyone on board, except the
mailman and wardroom steward whose duties took them ashore and, of
course all Skippers went ashore.</p>

<p>This lack of freedom did not make for happy ships, particularly with
the shore so near and crowds promenading up and down the seafront. If
any Skipper did let any of his men ashore, he took the risk and chanced
a good scrubbing if by chance the M.K. was suddenly made and he had to
put to sea and leave any of his crew behind; as, unless the man hid
until the ship returned, he was sure to be ticketed by an M.P. and that
would, or course, give the whole show away.</p>

<p>However, the <i>Falcon</i> never came in without at least one Watch
getting a few hours to stretch their legs and we managed thuswise.</p>

<p>As soon as we got to the buoy, the whaler and dinghy were at once
called away and the men concerned being already dressed for the beach,
were landed. All were on their honour not to leave the seafront, or, if
they did, for one or more to remain and keep an eye on the ship and in
case the &ldquo;Recall&rdquo; was hoisted, to be able to make touch
with the others, the whole party to be in the boats within four
minutes, leaving one minute to get on board. (On more than one occasion
I had to slip and pick up the last boat as I went past the pier end.) I
must say the Powers were very lenient and winked at a good deal, so
long as I was not caught out&mdash;though it was freely prophesied,
both afloat and ashore, that one day we should get our Waterloo!</p>

<p>We were cutting it pretty fine, I knew, but somehow, we managed it.
Of course, in the first instance, I had fell in the hands and explained
the situation clearly; if they let me down, I should get an almighty
scrubbing&mdash;perhaps a Court of Enquiry and they would get no more
Special Leave, as it was called.</p>

<p>However, it worked like a dream. It kept the men as happy as
sandboys, gave them something to look forward to and talk about in the
night watches and, what is more, I never had a man up for punishment
the whole time I had command of her.</p>

<p>I gave Number One complete discretion as regards granting leave,
with the result that there was not a smarter ship in the Division, or
even in the Flotilla. Number One need only threaten to stop the
Watch&rsquo;s &ldquo;Special&rdquo; if someone was not up to scratch,
for the remainder of the Watch to turn on the offender and nearly rend
him to pieces. I really think they valued that hour or two of Special
Leave far more than any legitimate leave. Partly, I suppose on account
of the element of risk, partly because they could swing it on the other
ships, but mainly as sheer relief from the deadly monotony of each
other&rsquo;s company in such confined quarters.</p>

<p>On one occasion I had to leave one man short. Twice with two men
short, but the crew had a funk hole arranged for just such a happening,
where the miscreants hid their sorrowing heads till the ship returned
and their chums brought up a current Leave Chit.</p>

<p>Personally, I had my own private recall signal, which I could always
see from the house&mdash;situated as we luckily were, on the
seafront.</p>

<p>One night when it was blowing a gale of wind from the S.W. and usual
beast of a sea was rolling into the harbour, I was pacing up and down
the dining-room keeping an eye on the ship, when suddenly I saw the
&ldquo;Recall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grabbing my greatcoat and slamming my cap on my head, I dashed off
for the Naval Pier, where the whaler would be waiting. I arrived at the
end of the pier soaking, but there was no whaler. I dashed into the
signal hut, to tell them to make a signal to the <i>Falcon</i> for her
to send the whaler in at once. A signal-man had just commenced taking a
signal at the time and he pointed to his pad. I, to my horror slowly
read word by word, as the signal came through from my First Lieutenant.
<i>Falcon</i>-to-Capt.-D-stop-regret-to-report-having-been-rammed-in-the-stern-by-<i>
Nimrod</i>-and-cut-down-to-water-line-stop.&rdquo; Here was I ashore
(where I had no business to be) and she, perhaps sinking. I
couldn&rsquo;t break in on the signal and tell them to send the boat; I
must stand helpless and impotent, waiting for the remainder of that
signal, whatever it might mean.</p>

<p>Dimly, through the swelter and rain, I could see her rolling,
heavily in the seaway and to my perfervid imagination, she seemed
distinctly deeper in the water. Was she sinking? All this and much more
flashed through my mind as I stood almost holding my breath, until the
signal-man continued and to my utter relief, I read,
&ldquo;Water-well-under-control-stop-in
no-immediate-danger-1030.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the whaler came alongside the pier and in I jumped.</p>

<p><br>
 Dark and raining though it was, there was a very obvious grin on every
face. With very good reason, too!</p>

<p>We were due out on patrol the next day and would have been out over
Christmas Day in that S.W. gale. Even if it eased up the sea would have
been beastly. Now we were in harbour and there was every likelihood of
staying there. No wonder there were smiling faces. The next week,
thanks to our good friend <i>Nimrod</i>, saw us on our way round to
Portsmouth, for a refit and to repair the damaged stern.</p>

<p>During our two strenuous years of service in the Patrol, we had a
mavellous run of luck and escape from accident. Apart from making
violent contact between my propellers and Hills Bank, just outside
Dunkirk, we hadn&rsquo;t scratched the paintwork. But the <i>Nimrod</i>
seemed to have broken the spell and her effort turned out to be the
opening chorus to a whole chapter of accidents&mdash;with Finis written
at the end.</p>

<p>The next trouble started though going up Portsmouth Harbour at 16
knots, exactly the same speed I used in Dover, or anywhere else for
that matter. What I didn&rsquo;t know, was, that the rigid maximum for
Portsmouth was 8 knots. Furthermore, it happened to be a very high tide
and we sent the water shooshing right up the streets, which in many
places are just on high-water level. Evidently there was some delay or
difficulty in locating the actual culprit, but the authorities, though
much too late then to impale the criminal, consoled themselves by
determining to catch us on the way out, when they thought we should, no
doubt, do the same trick. Well, we didn&rsquo;t and for the very good
reason that the whole harbour was shrouded in a regular pea-soup
fog.</p>

<p>From leaving the wharf we saw not a thing till we got up to the
forts at the entrance to the Harbour (neither could anyone see us).
Then we saw nothing till Beachy Head and only a glimpse of that. The
fog still thick as a hedge, we made the best of our way to the entrance
to Dover, which although buried in fog, we managed to make our numbers
and get permission to enter by sound signal, we made fast to a buoy for
a couple of hours and when it cleared went into Granville Dock for a
boiler clean. Then came the second patch of bad luck. We rather prided
ourselves on being able to slip our buoy and make fast in Granville
Dock in the record time of nine minutes, where others sometimes took
the best part of an hour. I used the same old speed, namely 16 knots, a
speed which gave one perfect control with those powerful engines. It
wasn&rsquo;t altogether swank that induced me to use that speed, it was
the fact that I knew from experience that a Destroyer, like an Atlantic
liner, is easier handled at a high speed.</p>

<p>We had landed the man who usually attended the engine-room
telegraphs, as he was also the mailman. The Yeoman of Signals, who
ordinarily would have been on the Searchlight Platform, was taking duty
at the telegraphs.</p>

<p>To handle the telegraphs, he had to stand facing aft and the result
was that he did not see the flag of a diving party working at the Dock
Entrance. Worse still, he didn&rsquo;t see that they had the red flag
mastheaded, signifying the diver was down. The diver, by a curious
coincidence, was working on the wreck of a Destroyer that had come to
grief in a gale of wind and sunk for the very reason that the skipper
was not using enough power on his engines and thereby lost control of
his ship. As a result, she fell on the stone knuckle, smashed up and
sunk.</p>

<p>When the Yeoman did, at last, see the flag, and reported it to me
that divers were down, it was too late to stop her. If I had then come
astern on the engines I should only have churned up the water and
endangered the diver still more. So I did the best I could in the
circumstances and just stopped the engines, letting her run with her
own way.</p>

<p>The Commander in charge of the diving party was naturally mad,
thinking I had purposely ignored his flag. Still, if he had come to me,
I would have explained how difficult it was to see his old flag, which
was abominably dirty, and was up against a brick wall a few shades
dirtier.</p>

<p>Worse was to follow.</p>

<p>Having passed the diver, we at once went to our 16 knots again and
shot in through the lock gates. At the best of times with the dock
empty it was always touch and go getting through these gates and
swinging at an immediate right angle. This time there was, by further
rotten luck, a transport lying in the far corner, where we had to
moor.</p>

<p>Immediately the stern was clear of the end of the lock, as usual, I
put the helm hard a port and went half speed astern on the starboard
engine which should swing her round eight points in her own length.
Unfortunately, the Yeoman instead of putting the starboard telegraph to
half speed astern, put it ahead. Seeing that she was gathering way
instead of stopping, I gave the order &ldquo;Full speed astern
both.&rdquo; He then put both telegraphs to &ldquo;Full speed
ahead.&rdquo; Of course, she just leapt across the dock and though, in
a couple of seconds more I did succeed in getting the &ldquo;Full Speed
Astern&rdquo; she crumpled up her bow like a piece of paper on the
transport in the corner.</p>

<p>The Yeoman was a good fellow and owned up to his mistake like a man,
when I taxed him with how it had happened. So I told him not to worry,
that I would get him out of it somehow, or the other and I wended my
way round to Headquarters to report my mishap.</p>

<p>I was saluted with &ldquo;Hello, what have you been up
to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Naturally thinking Captain &ldquo;D&rdquo; alluded to my little
mishap in the dock, I started with,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, sir, the telegraphs were unfortunately put the
wrong way and before I could regain control, we crashed into the
transport. I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, sir, I&rsquo;m afraid it means
another dockyard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He asked me what on earth I was rambling about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you speaking about my smash in Granville dock,
sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I the devil! You&rsquo;ve been reported by the C. in C.
Portsmouth for leaving that harbour at an excessive speed and now you
have just been reported again for passing a Diving Party also at an
excessive speed. On top of that you tell me you have crashed in
Granville Dock and rammed a Transport. You can&rsquo;t think of
anything else while you are on the subject, can you?</p>

<p>It needed a deep breath before I could start in and tell him, that
in the first place, they were infernal liars in Portsmouth, that the
Diving Party&rsquo;s flag was too dirty to distinguish up against the
brick wall and, finally that the Yeoman in consequence was so upset he
forgot he was facing aft and put the telegraphs to Full Ahead instead
of Full Astern.</p>

<p>I must say I was really a bit surprised myself, when at last he did
seem to come round to my point of view.</p>

<p>Of course I explained how in ignorance I had entered Portsmouth and
gone up the harbour at an undoubtedly excessive speed, but that the
Dockyard authorities had been too slow in the uptake to hang the blame
on the <i>Falcon</i>. Furthermore, that I knew full well they were out
for my blood and had determined to catch me on the way out. Not only
was I just as determined they should not catch me, but in any case they
had been completely defeated by the fog. When I suggested that Dover
should call for a weather report on the date in question, I think
Captain &ldquo;D&rdquo; saw the joke and called. They must have settled
it between them, for I heard nothing more of that little episode.</p>

<p>To the Commander of the Diving Party, I submitted an abject
apology&mdash;and suggested he should requisition a new flag, more in
keeping with his dignity and the importance of the work he had in
hand&mdash;or send the old one to the laundry. I heard nothing more
from <i>him</i>, so that was another out of the way.</p>

<p>Next, I was asked what punishment I proposed to mete out to the
Yeoman of Signals&mdash;since in the Service the punishment must always
fit the crime. I submitted that he was a damn good man&mdash;that it
wasn&rsquo;t his job on the telegraphs anyhow, furthermore, if he had
been in his proper place, on the signal platform, he would have seen
the Diver&rsquo;s flag and, in short, I didn&rsquo;t propose to do
anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you <i>must</i> do something in order that I can report
that the necessary disciplinary steps have been taken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll reprimand
him.&rdquo; (which is the lowest scale of punishment on the list). Even
so, it would still have gone on the Charge Sheet and might have
affected his promotion, just then due.</p>

<p>After thinking it over, I had him fell-in and just said,
&ldquo;Consider yourself reprimanded.&rdquo; (The only point was that I
had not reprimanded him.) I walked away chuckling to myself at the
blank look of the Master-at-Arms, trying to puzzle out what he should
enter in his precious book. Finally he appealed to the First
Lieutenant, who, in turn, asked me what I wanted entered. I told him I
was not a bit interested in what was entered; with the result that
nothing was entered and the Yeoman in due course got his promotion
without losing a single day.</p>

<p>Just out of sheer cussedness it would seem, the crew being
Portsmouth men, we were sent up to Hull to refit and whilst there, the
orders came that the whole of my Division was to be transferred to the
6th Flotilla with its base on Immingham, at the mouth of the Humber. We
were finished and had unwittingly said good-bye to Dover and the hectic
life of the Dover Patrol. Most of us were frankly sorry, for although
it had been a life that called for the best in a man&mdash;and took the
most&mdash;still it was <i>real</i> life and the one and only stretch
of sea where one was in close and constant touch with Jerry the
Hun.</p>

<p>The reason for our transfer was that with the new minefield laid and
the installing of Lightships with their three million candle power
flares, the Straits had become a shade too unhealthy even for the
ubiquitous Bosche. In fact, one could safely say, after many years of
experimenting, that the Straits were absolutely and effectively
closed.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</h3>

<h4>LOSS OF H.M.S. &ldquo;FALCON&rdquo;</h4>

<p>The North Sea was also in the process of being closed in much the
same way, with the result that concentrated submarine warfare was being
waged on our North Sea Convoys.</p>

<p>I suppose our division should have felt duly elated at being chosen
to join up with the 6th and help deal with this fresh underwater
effort. Perhaps it was a feather in our heavy weather caps. Anyhow it
didn&rsquo;t matter for if we had dismally sung our requiem to the
Dover Patrol, we certainly were in good time for the opening chorus on
the East Coast. They turned their submarines out on us, as the Yanks
say, &ldquo;Good and plenty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stretch they devoted most of their attention to, was between the
Firth of Forth and the Humber. Further south the Convoys were more or
less under the protection of sandbanks. Poor old <i>Falcon</i>. She was
not destined to see much service up there. The second night out we were
cut in half and sunk.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a risky job working a Convoy at night time without
lights. A slight misjudgment like the Gunner made as Officer of the
Watch and it is all over. A destroyer&rsquo;s plating is only
three-sixteenths of an inch thick, so there is not much to come and go
on. We were almost cut through. In fact the forepart broke off during
the night and sunk. Before this happened I had ordered &ldquo;Abandon
ship.&rdquo; First the engineers and stokers were got away on to a
trawler. That made her more workable, but it was not long before it was
very evident she was not going to last the night. So, later on, the
general order, &ldquo;Abandon ship&rdquo; was carried out and every one
was sent away, except the First Lieutenant and the Gunner, who stayed
on board with me, until she went altogether.</p>

<p>There was just the possibility of getting hold of a trawler and
towing the after end in, if it would float long enough. If it went
down, we went too, but we always had the chance of being picked up.
What did trouble me was the fact that one of the depth charges
wouldn&rsquo;t set to &ldquo;Safe&rdquo; properly. It is the
Gunner&rsquo;s job, when there is any likelihood of a ship sinking, to
put all depth charges to &ldquo;safe.&rdquo; When he reported, he
imparted the cheerful information that there was a sporting chance that
one of them would go off if the ship sank.</p>

<p>If one of them did go off then the whole blame lot would undoubtedly
follow suit. In that case it meant that all three of us would get a
good start on the way!</p>

<p>It was a bitterly cold night in February, raining and blowing to
beat the band and we were wet through and mighty cheerless. The wind
being strong from the westward, we were steadily drifting out to sea
and across towards the German coast. I really don&rsquo;t know why I
stuck to her, as obviously she was bound to go down before long. I
suppose it could only have been one&rsquo;s natural reluctance to leave
your ship whilst she still floats.</p>

<p>About midnight the fore part , after wobbling about independent of
the rest of the ship, broke right off and sank. The after end was down
at an angle of about 30&ordm; at the time and steadily sinking. There
were no boats as they had all gone away with the crew. The whaler did
stand by until the crew was exhausted with the cold and wet.</p>

<p>I was also frightfully anxious about one of the stokers who had been
badly scalded in the stokehold, when some of the steam pipes burst
immediately after the collision. He had been put on board a trawler, as
it turned out later on, but even the help they were able to give him
was of no avail, he died.</p>

<p>The dreary night dragged out its cheerless prospect. There was
nothing we could do and we had nothing to eat---though the Gunner did
manage, after much effort, to get a fire going in my cabin and make
some tea. That drink of scalding hot tea put new life into us.</p>

<p>By 1 a.m. she was getting very low and at a still more acute angle.
It seemed it could only be a matter of minutes before she took her
final dip. How the minutes dragged by with nothing to do. It was bad
enough in the <i>Titanic</i>, but in that case there was plenty to
occupy both our hands and our minds.</p>

<p>Two o&rsquo;clock came and she was still afloat; 2:15 and the end
was surely near. Then, without a moment&rsquo;s earning, a bulkhead
suddenly carried away and she sank like a stone, almost to the minute
the <i>Titanic</i> sank and we were, as then, left swimming around in
the icy cold water.</p>

<p>As the ship disappeared under the waves, out one and only thought
was, &ldquo;Are those infernal depth charges going off under us, or are
they not?&rdquo; It was not a bit of use doing anything whatever until
that question was settled. So we just paddled and waited. After a
minute or two it was evident that they were not, so that was one
relief. We joined up with some wreckage and swam and whistled and
shouted in the hope of attracting someone&rsquo;s attention. About half
an hour later a trawler hove in sight and, near as a toucher, ran us
down. Had I not had the usual officer&rsquo;s whistle in my pocket, I
believe she would.</p>

<p>We were taken on board and given blankets and a good hot drink.</p>

<p>It had long since become the rule in the Navy that whether a ship
was lost through negligence, accident, enemy action or what not, a
Court Martial must be held, whereby the Captain is either blamed or
exonerated. It was a good practice. Then, as in the case of the
<i>Falcon</i>, there was no stigma remaining. Poor Gunner, he thought
there was going to be some stigma all right, and had made up his mind
from the outset that he, at any rate was finished, as far as the Navy
was concerned. He would be sent back to big ships, and never get
another chance of a Destroyer (which is everybody&rsquo;s aim and
ambition.) &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;you just wait and
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eventually we got into harbour and went through the usual
formalities attending the loss of one of H.M.&rsquo;s ships. Gunner
still one hundred per cent. pessimistic. Then came the great day of the
Court Martial. Deputy Judge Advocate up from Whitehall and quite a big
show. Plenty of three and four stripers to collect sections of our
hide.</p>

<p>By the time the Court had assembled, the Gunner was still down and
out. I still told him the same Asquithian story, &ldquo;Wait and
see.&rdquo; I assured him, somewhat blindly, that the tale was not yet
all told and anyway in the back of my mind that things were not going
to break so badly as he thought.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid the solemnity of a full blown Naval Court Martial,
with all its traditions and red tape did not strike me as as awe
inspiring as it might have done. I know I inadvertently and ignorantly
broke a number of those Naval relics. The first tradition or custom to
go by the board was for the prisoner (that was me) to appear without a
&ldquo;Friend.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the custom for a
&ldquo;Prisoner&rdquo; to choose someone well versed in legal lore,
King&rsquo;s Regulations and so forth, to act as his sort of Naval
Lawyer. I chose the Navigator out of the Barracks, simply because we
were very good friends. But it so happened that on the great morning
when escorted by Provost Martial (in ordinary walks of life he&rsquo;d
be called the Bobby) and I called for my &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; I found
him wading knee deep in charts. Half jokingly he said, &ldquo;Look
here, old man, can&rsquo;t you manage without me? I&rsquo;m frightfully
busy.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yes, of course. Don&rsquo;t bother.
I&rsquo;ll manage fine.&rdquo; And marched off quite happily.</p>

<p>The proceedings commenced by reading over a Narrative of Events
which I had prepared, instead of being cross-questioned. This, in
itself was no small departure I found out later, but on the other hand
it saved quite a lot of time. I had carefully tabulated and typed
several copies of all that had occurred on that eventful night, hour by
hour and even minute by minute, adding a rider to the end to the effect
that &ldquo;The highest traditions of the British Navy were maintained
throughout.&rdquo; I also gave the Gunner a good boost up by saying:
&ldquo;Especially would I bring to the notice of the Court the
behaviour of the Gunner, Mr. Shonk, who remained with me on the wreck
and maintained an attitude of the utmost cheerfulness,&rdquo; etc.,
etc., &ldquo;who frequently went down the after stokehold reporting
conditions to me and at other times, made tea and played the
gramophone.&rdquo; The tea and gramophone touch was perfectly true, but
I included it partly as a joke, when I was writing the narrative and
never for an instant thought it would be read out before the whole
Court. I can yet see the Judge Advocate (who, to my horror, said he
would read it to the Court), with solemn jowl reading out loud and me
wondering if there would be an earthquake when he came to the last
item. However, it just seemed to strike the right chord and caused a
grin&mdash;much to my relief.</p>

<p>Next thing, the President spotted that I was without a Friend and he
promptly stopped the proceedings. &ldquo;The prisoner has not got a
Friend,&rdquo; he said in a shocked voice. I, like an ass, said,
&ldquo;No, sir, he said he was too busy and would I manage without
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t realise just how ridiculous this statement was. About
on a par with a chap who is being tried for murder and who tells the
judge that his Lawyer is away playing golf.</p>

<p>The court plodded steadily through the set questions and cross
questions, and cross questions, asking me, as each witness finished,
&ldquo;If I wished to cross-examine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, I didn&rsquo;t. I just wanted to get the thing over and
the Gunner out of the soup. Not till the Gunner had been called and
examined&mdash;and hide it as he might, the fact that he was the
culprit stuck out a mile. &ldquo;Do you wish to cross-examine?&rdquo;
and on the impulse of the moment I said, &ldquo;Yes I did.&rdquo;
Though for the life of me I could not have said why.</p>

<p>I think they all thought I was now going to pin the blame
irrevocably where it belonged. Well, they were <i>wrong</i>. I was out
to soften the going for the Gunner, for he was looking pretty bleak,
poor devil, as of course he did not know what I was getting at.</p>

<p>I started in: &ldquo;How long have you been in Destroyers?&rdquo;
&ldquo;How long have you been under my command?&rdquo; &ldquo;you have
been Officer of the Watch?&rdquo; &ldquo;You have been in sole charge
of the Watch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the President got my idea but suggested quite kindly that I
should not ask leading questions. I apologised and set out again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you had full charge of the bridge at night on
patrol?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have had full charge in the Downs, with a Convoy getting
under weigh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then before I realised quite what I was doing, I reverted to leading
questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have never been reprimanded by me for getting too close
to anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To all of which he replied, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
just as the questions required, wondering what on earth I was heading
for. As a matter of fact, I hardly knew myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have had to man&oelig;uvre in amongst ships in the
Downs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have never had an accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have had full confidence in yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You still have full confidence in yourself now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that I sat down.</p>

<p>I think the President saw my game as it developed and wanted to
help. The outcome was that after the Court had adjourned to consider
the verdict and duly returned, we were again called in. The hilt of my
sword towards me (signifying <i>I</i> was exonerated). The D.J.A. then
read a eulogy that fairly made me blush and the Gunner&rsquo;s eyes
stand out like hatpegs. In short, the Court had &ldquo;found&rdquo;
that far from being to blame, they had really discovered in us
potential heroes by sticking to and going down with our ship.</p>

<p>But what was more to the point, the Gunner went to the biggest
Destroyer building, ditto the engineer&mdash;who had been scared stiff
he was going to be scrubbed for leaving the ship, whilst we other three
stuck to her. The same thing happened to Number One who also went to a
big Destroyer.<br>
</p>

<hr><a name="ch43"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</h3>

<h4>NORTH SEA CONVOYS</h4>

<p>I was lucky to get appointed to the <i>Garry</i>, the biggest
Destroyer up there. The Admiralty, as a matter of fact, kicked about
giving her to me, but our Admiral stuck out and sent me to her, but it
was a month before Whitehall confirmed my command. She was a
Commander&rsquo;s command R.N. and I was only a two and a half striper,
R.N.R. I got her in the end and a fine ship she was too, though a wet
one.</p>

<p>No more patrol work. My job now was to work the Convoys altogether.
Pick them up on their way across from Norway and escort them down to
the Humber. After that they were more or less in safety. At that time
we were losing as many as six ships out of a single Convoy by submarine
attack.</p>

<p>The concentration of submarines in the North Sea was now one of the
greatest menaces of the War and it was a mighty big problem how to meet
it. The Grand Fleet would not part up with a single Destroyer, on the
grounds that they couldn&rsquo;t be spared and here we were with boats
that should have been on the scrap heap, to deal with the vital problem
of sea-borne supplies.</p>

<p>Apart from the losses to the country, as a Merchant Service man it
made one furious to see these ships sunk on sight, without a chance of
them defending themselves, much less retaliating. What a hope, with
about forty ships traveling at eight knots, in four lines ahead. The
loss of shipping in the North Sea had got so bad that at last someone
got a very severe rap over the knuckles and an Admiral was shoved on
the shelf.</p>

<p>After seeing the method of convoying I was not altogether surprised
at the numbers sunk.</p>

<p>The approved plan of protection was for one Destroyer to go ahead of
the Convoy, about a mile or a mile and a half. One other Destroyer on
each side, abeam and a fourth astern. To my mind an utterly inadequate
disposal, particularly when one takes into consideration the method of
attack.</p>

<p>A submarine sights a Convoy, knowing beforehand exactly when it is
expected. She arranges her speed so she can get a preliminary
&ldquo;sight&rdquo; before the head of the Convoy passes. She then
submerges and rises again for a second sight and to fire when the main
body of the Convoy comes into her line of vision. Hardly ever did they
loose off, what is called a &ldquo;Browning&rdquo; shot. That is a
blind shot into the Convoy as a pack. They deliberately picked their
ship and with only one Destroyer to contend with this was easy. The
Destroyer ahead had passed them and the Destroyer astern of the Convoy
was miles away. So, providing she could keep an eye on the one abeam
they were comparatively safe. Events and the position of the majority
of ships lost, all went to prove this.</p>

<p>I had some heated arguments with the authorities on the subject, as
when in charge of a Convoy I insisted on my own disposition, placing
one Destroyer on each side abreast of the leading ships. The other two
abreast of the last ships (the most we were ever allowed was one
division of four Destroyers to a Convoy).</p>

<p>My contention was that the submarine took a sight just before the
head of the Convoy came abreast of her. Her second sight was taken and
the shot fired when half the Convoy had passed. By any method she could
be spotted taking her first sight by the Destroyer abreast of the
leading ships and if not then, would stand every chance of being seen
and downed when she fired, by the Destroyer abreast of the rearmost
ship.</p>

<p>I was allowed to continue with my &ldquo;Theory&rdquo; after I
brought down six Convoys, averaging forty ships and lost only one and
over that I claimed to have sunk the swine that bagged the ship, but I
had no conclusive proof. I saw her periscope as she fired and put down
fourteen depth charges all round her. If she wasn&rsquo;t smashed up
and put down, I&rsquo;m a Dutchman. We had the meagre satisfaction of a
general signal being made to the effect that &ldquo;the
<i>Garry&rsquo;s</i> attack was brilliantly conceived and well carried
out.&rdquo; Still that was something</p>

<p>There had been so many reports of submarines sunk, that perhaps a
little scepticism in high quarters was not altogether unwarranted. But
it was small satisfaction, when one knew for a <i>certainty</i>, that
one had been downed. The trouble was getting the exact position and
later on locating him in that depth of water. Of course, if you blew
him open and conclusive evidence came to the surface, that was
sufficient. The only alternative was to ram the submarine, as I was
fortunate enough to do later on and then there could be no quibble.</p>

<p>It was a sickening experience to hear that deadly clanging crash,
see a column of water leap up alongside a merchant ship and the ship
herself tip up and go down, often in a minute, perhaps in only a few
seconds, and at the same time, knowing full well that at least half her
crew had gone with her. This concentrated submarine attack on the
Convoys up and down the coast took a toll and tightened many a
belt.</p>

<p>The <i>Garry</i> managed to collect quite a bit of credit one way
and another. Some merited and some not altogether merited.</p>

<p>On one occasion, bringing down a single ship of considerable speed
and something especially valuable, we were passing the Wash (rather a
notorious spot for losing ships to a submarine that was reputed to lie
there). We met the Destroyer on patrol and knowing also from experience
that it was a good spot for fish, I made a signal, &ldquo;Going to drop
a depth charge. Will you pick up the fish and bring some in with
you?&rdquo; He followed at a respectable distance astern, ready to drop
his boats in the water and pick up the fish. Just one on each side of
the Transport, having previously warned him, so as to avoid giving
those on board an unnecessary jar.</p>

<p>To be in the vicintity of a depth charge when it explodes is to get
both a mental and physical shock of the first water. Unbeknown to me
there must have been some Big Bug on the Transport, for, to my
surprise, the Admiral got a most effusive letter commending the
&ldquo;Defensive Action of the <i>Garry</i>, ets., etc.&rdquo; Little
did he realise I just wanted some fish.</p>

<p>A little later I nearly got caught out at the same game.</p>

<p>With another Destroyer we were bound up for the Firth of Forth to
pick up a Convoy coming across from Norway and as we were due to be in
a locality where I knew there was good cod, I made the other chap a
signal that I was going to drop a depth charge at 7 a.m. and would give
him some fish for breakfast. When 7a.m. came, as bad luck would have
it, we met a ship coming down, escorted by a Destroyer ( miles ahead of
her) and a Blimp. The Destroyer, being out of range and hearing, I
determined not to be done out of our fish, so let go. The Transport
thought he had caught a packet at first, but, to their relief they
found it was only us at our games, whilst we lowered our boats and
picked up a nice catch for both ships&rsquo; crews. Whilst our boats
were in the water, the Blimp came nosing around, no doubt just out of
sheer curiosity, wondering what we were doing. It would have been all
right if he had left it at that, but he didn&rsquo;t and a few days
later I got a signal from the Admiral of the East Coast, to
&ldquo;Report what your boats were doing in the water on such and such
a date in latitude and longitude so and so. Well, I couldn&rsquo;t say
we were looking for a submarine with the ship's boats and I was not
going to say we were picking up fish for breakfast, so, knowing the
Navy mind, I signaled in reply, &ldquo;Re your 0014. Submit boats were
examining objects on surface of water.&rdquo; It was quite true and as
I heard nothing further, my reply was evidently satisfactory.</p>

<p>As far as possible we used to work in two divisions. One with R.N.
men in command and the other with R.N.R. chaps in command. This set up
a useful bit of rivalry and it was due to this disposition that I was
able to prove out my &ldquo;Theory&rdquo; of effective defence on
Convoy escort.</p>

<p>If I was Senior Officer of Convoy, the instructions were, &ldquo;Act
first and report afterwards.&rdquo; They were encouraged to think for
themselves and take the risk. The result was, that each Destroyer was
as good as a Division, in that she was an independent unit free to do
what she pleased within reasonable limits. If a submarine tried its
games, each ship went for him as and how she could. Everyone
concentrated on the spot without waiting for signals and from every
angle. As she came within possible range of where the submarine might
then be, she commenced to let go depth charges. Other Destroyers coming
into the fray from different angles, also let go. Whilst the
M.L.&rsquo;s also tore around letting go indiscriminately. Each one had
to keep a mighty close eye on the business end of a ship crossing his
bows, or he might find himself gaily sailing over a spot where a depth
charge had just been sown, with every chance of it coming up through
his bottom. In point of fact it&rsquo;s not safe to be within a couple
of hundred yards when one does detonate. A Destroyer, for instance,
should be making her twenty knots when she lets go if she&rsquo;s not
going to risk blowing her own bottom in. To obviate this risk, with the
trawlers, which had not the speed to get out of range of their own
depth charges, they were fitted with depth charge throwers, which flung
the charge out abreast of them to a safe distance. Those ships dropping
them from their sterns, you could keep your eye on, but even then it
was hard enough to keep clear, but when three or four trawlers joined
in the crossword puzzle and lumped off their depth charges in all odd
and sundry directions, the confusion certainly became worse confounded
and the water for a mile or more around, a churned up mass, with each
ship steering in every direction. It was a miracle that we never had a
collision.</p>

<p>Occasionally we scored with a direct hit and then there was definite
proof. Other times, just a spread of oil, big or little, according to
the damage done. More frequently just nothing at all, though that
didn&rsquo;t say we hadn&rsquo;t sent to sub. to her last account.</p>

<p>Neither &ldquo;verbal proof&rdquo; nor &ldquo;traces of oil&rdquo;
were accepted as evidence of a bag. Bring in a body, or any part of the
internals of a submarine and you were duly credited. But that was
mighty difficult when it was considered what a small amount of buoyant
substance goes into the structure of one of these underwater craft.
Even then, nothing less than an absolutely direct hit would bring it
out. Many a time and often, I was convinced in my own mind and to my
complete satisfaction that we had put one down, but lacking any sort of
acceptable proof, I merely submitted the time honoured report, without
any claim&mdash;just resting on the satisfaction of another Convoy
delivered intact.</p>

<p>We got our second &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; sub. off the Firth of
Forth one night. I call it unofficial, since we again couldn&rsquo;t
claim, though in this case also there was not a shadow of doubt. We had
brought along one of the big Convoys across the North Sea and, passing
the Firth, those that were bound there had broken off.</p>

<p>It was a ticklish job, this breaking off. Pitch dark and no one
showing the glimpse of a light. A dozen or more ships to break away and
worm themselves free of the Convoy, steering a course at an angle to
the other ships, crossing one&rsquo;s ship&rsquo;s stern,
another&rsquo;s bow. Only a suspicion of broken water to be seen in the
dark and then merely a guess as to whether it is from a ship&rsquo;s
bow or her propeller. The man on the bridge must judge right and
quickly, for a mistake means not only the probable loss of his own
ship, but may involve half a dozen others coming up astern. Added to
this, there were always two or three Destroyers breaking off at the
same time. Still, I never saw an accident; all credit to the men in the
Merchant Ships.</p>

<p>The night to which I was alluding, those ships bound in for the
Firth had broken off and the rest of the Convoy had formed up again. I
had just taken the <i>Garry</i> round the rear end of the Convoy to see
there were no stragglers and was making up again to the position we
always kept, on the seaward side of the rear ships of the Convoy, when
a submarine, thinking the whole, of the Convoy had passed, came up and
broke surface with his conning tower.</p>

<p>As I have already explained, we kept all guns loaded with the breech
mechanism lever just withdrawn. All that <i>any</i> man had to do was
to push the B.M. lever home and fire. The look-out at the after end of
the ship, whose station was alongside the after twelve pounder, saw the
submarine break surface&mdash;and here was where our system came in.
Instead of rushing to the bridge to report and so losing sight of his
object, or even yelling along the decks in the hope of someone passing
the word, he at once trained his gun on the submarine as she rose and
let fly.</p>

<p>Standing on the port side of the bridge, I happened to be looking
seaward on the port quarter, when the After look-out fired and though
in the pitch blackness I couldn&rsquo;t see the submarine herself, I
could distinctly see the impact of the shell as it struck the hull and
exploded inside. It as all over in a split second, the flash of the
gun, the crash and explosion, the impact of the shell on iron and the
following much smaller flash. The whole procedure was just a mental
photograph, clear and distinct and I&rsquo;ll take oath on a stack of
Bibles a mile high that that submarine still lies in the deep water
away north of St. Abbs Head.</p>

<p>But would that have convinced the Authorities? Not a bit of it. So I
saved myself the trouble of claiming and just gave the usual, &ldquo;I
have the honour to report that on such and such a night at such and
such a time, in alt. and long., so and so, I sank a submarine by
gunfire, etc.,&rdquo; all of which I&rsquo;ve no doubt, raised a
sympathetic smile&mdash;and, small wonder, they&rsquo;d heard the tale
before. They wanted PROOF.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</h3>

<h4>DESTROYER v. SUBMARINE</h4>

<p>A few days later another Destroyer gave proof enough, and here is an
example of the luck of the game. One chap may be on his toes all the
time and never get his chance, whilst another comes along and simply
falls over a submarine. (The War, as far as we were concerned had long
since resolved itself into the state of Submarine versus
Destroyer.)</p>

<p>The Captain of the lucky ship and I were very good friends and
former shipmates and we used to knock around together a lot. The
<i>Garry</i> happened to be lying alongside, when my pal Grant came
ashore on his way to hand in his written report of how, where and when
, he came to sink this submarine and capture her entire crew. Seeing
the <i>Garry</i> alongside, he just dropped on board for a
minute&rsquo;s yarn. Of course, I heartily congratulated him as soon as
he showed his nose in my cabin and asked him just how he had managed to
ram and sink this submarine, which was quite a modern one and carried
two four inch guns against Grant&rsquo;s measly 12- and 6-pounders. He
shoved his report into my hand and told me to read it, when I would
then know all about it.</p>

<p>I read all the usual preamble and trimmings, till I came to where he
&ldquo;sighted this submarine whilst in his position astern of the
Convoy." &ldquo;Astern of the Convoy?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Why you are
the one, above all others, who condemns that method of following up
astern. How the devil did you come to be there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed and after swearing me to secrecy told me his tale.</p>

<p>It appeared some slight trouble had developed in his engine-room.
The engineer came on the bridge and asked permission to stop the
engines for half an hour or so. Instead of following the correct
routine and making a wireless signal to the S.O. of the Division and
having, perhaps, to state whys and wherefores, he said to the engineer,
&ldquo;Well if it&rsquo;s only going to take half an hour, I&rsquo;ll
slip round astern of the Convoy and stop her. Get through as soon as
you can and we will put her to it and pick &lsquo;em up again and no
one will be any the wiser." The repairs took a bit longer than the time
stipulated and Grant got a bit anxious. It was pitch dark and there was
just the horrible chance that he might lose the Convoy altogether and
then he <i>would</i> get a sound scrubbing, if he was found wandering
around looking for a Convoy when daylight broke. The result was that
when the word did at last come from the engine-room that they were
&ldquo;ready to proceed,&rdquo; Grant at once put her to twenty knots,
intending to slow her down when he had run his distance to within a
couple of miles of where the Convoy should be and then pick them up at
an easy speed, for it was far too dark to see more than a hundred yards
ahead. As it turned out, Grant&rsquo;s underwater friend had heard the
convoy lumbering along and as it was far too dark for him to even take
a &ldquo;Browning&rdquo; shot, he had submerged until the ships had all
passed overhead. When they were past and even the Destroyer that, as he
knew, in some cases trailed out astern, would, he judged, be well out
of the way, he rose to the surface intending to lie there and get a
breath of fresh air till daylight.</p>

<p>The first thing they knew was Grant came blinding along at an
absolutely unheard of speed, for a Destroyer following up a Convoy,
hitting them half way between the conning tower and tail. As Grant
said, he &ldquo;never saw a blame thing till he was right on top of him
and couldn&rsquo;t have missed him if he had tried.&rdquo; Grant
actually went right over, doing little or no damage to the submarine.
The skipper of the submarine got a horrible shock, on seeing a
Destroyer shoot out of the darkness and, literally, leap over him. He
fully thought that Grant&rsquo;s ramming had been intentional, also
that his sub. would be damaged and being unable to submerge, would be
sunk by gunfire. To avoid this, he ordered the Kingston flooding valves
to be opened and took to the one and only boat and sang
&ldquo;Deutschland &uuml;ber Alles&rdquo; whilst his ship went down.
Meantime, Grant, who had ripped the bottom out of his ship had just
time to signal the S.O. of his Division, take to the boats and
<i>his</i> ship went down. All he could do now was to await the coming
of a Destroyer to pick them up&mdash;unaware, of course, that the
submarine had opened her Kingston valves and abandoned ship. It was a
perfectly calm night and as they could hear the Germans in the distance
singing their song of success, Grant&rsquo;s crowd retaliated by
joining the marine musical comedy with &ldquo;Rule, Britannia.&rdquo;
When the S.O. arrived on the scene and heard the row, as he said, he
thought everyone had gone completely crazy. But the utter disgust of
the sub. skipper can be best imagined, when a bit later on he learnt
the facts of the case.</p>

<p>In the first place, he had surrendered to a ship, which he could
have blown out of the water and in the second place he had sunk his own
ship where there was no need, as Grant having ripped the bottom out of
his ship had already gone down.</p>

<p>The very next day, &ldquo;Capt. D&rdquo; came along to me bubbling
over with satisfaction, &ldquo;There you are, my lad, Destroyer astern
of the Convoy rams and sinks a submarine. Where is your
&lsquo;Theory&rsquo; now?&rdquo; This went on for a good half an hour
and I could see the re-adoption of the rotten old method and with it
the losses in ships going up and up instead of coming down and down.
There is nothing for it, I thought, so here goes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look here, sir, if I tell you something will you promise
faithfully to keep it under your own cap and not let it influence your
appreciation of Grant&rsquo;s little effort?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He promised and I&rsquo;ll say his face was a study when I told him
the inside history.<br>
<br>
 All Capt. D. said was a very heartfelt, &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m
damned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But we heard nothing more of reverting to the old method.
Grant&rsquo;s stock went up with a bound and he was put alongside the
wharf to act as flagship whilst in port.</p>

<p>The grades of favour were very marked and quite distinct. That ship,
highest in favour, got the wharf job and one could go ashore any time.
The rest of the flotilla laid at the buoys. The next in favour nearest
the wharf and so on up the line of buoys and down the scale of grace.
Those farthest away, being the bad boys of the family, were not likely
to forget their misdeeds or misfortunes either and the last two or
three buoys came right abreast of a Fish Manure Factory.</p>

<p>In summer time with an off shore wind, which it usually seemed to
be, you could cut the air with a knife. Not a port or a skylight could
be opened. The <i>Garry</i> knew every grade and stage in the
manufacture of fish manure. Not content with the perishing stink, those
farthest up the line also got most of the odd jobs, chasing submarines.
Sometimes real but more often fictitious.</p>

<p>Someone outside sees a porpoise and, on the off chance that it is a
Tin Fish, makes a signal that they have sighted a submarine. Next thing
the ship alongside the Wharf hoists &ldquo;<i>Garry</i> and
<i>Stour</i>. Raise full steam for full speed with all dispatch.
Proceed to position so and so and search for submarine reported in that
vicintity.&rdquo; Off you go and so spend the best part of the day that
you might with luck and good conduct have spent ashore. After being
roped in for this little joy ride a couple of times, instead of
spending the best part of the day searching for a submarine (if not
actually fictitious, at least certain to be miles away by the time we
had got down the Humber and out to sea) I evolved the plan of
&ldquo;sighting&rdquo; the sub., dropping a packet of Depth Charges,
making the necessary report and returning to our smelly buoy with
everyone perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p>If there happened to be any sort of a breeze from the N.E., then
every member of the crew was more than satisfied to get back to the
quiet of the buoy, fish manure notwithstanding.</p>

<p>What a coast it is in a N.E. Gale. To zigzag along with a Convoy,
day after day, doing a bare 8 knots is enough the try the stomach of a
lion and the heart of a Saint, and what a sight to see those forty-odd
ships constituting the Convoy picking up their anchors and, one by one,
steaming out round the Spurn as daylight broke and into the driving
gale. One minute in a mill pond, the next diving and thrashing about
with clouds of spray flying across the decks.</p>

<p>As S.O., we had to wait (and how willingly we waited) under the lee
of the Spurn, till the last ship had picked up and got out. Convoy
orders from the Convoy officer delivered on board and then we were for
it. A cold winter&rsquo;s morning and sea like nothing on earth. Out we
would have to go, with nothing for the next couple of days and nights
but roll, roll, roll. The one saving grace of the bad weather was that
it made it impossible for the submarines to attack with any degree of
accuracy. Furthermore, if an attack were made anywhere near the
surface, there was a ten to one chance that her conning tower would
show between the seas and that would soon put paid to her little
efforts.</p>

<p>It was bad enough on the surface, but it must have been hell for
those chaps under water. No wonder one heard of all sorts of wheezes to
get rid of their Mouldies and return to the Fatherland. Still, by far
the majority of their ships were manned by men of pluck and resource,
the only pity being, that it was expended on such an unworthy
cause.</p>

<p>The man that could sink a merchantman, from below the surface,
without giving him the ghost of a chance, must have had a mentality
lower than the worst aborigine and heaven knows, they glory in some
pretty flthy practices.</p>

<p>Anyhow, that was my feeling about them and their work, so I suppose
there was little wonder that when one did surrender to us, I refused to
accept the hands-up business. In fact it was simply amazing that they
should have had the infernal audacity to offer to surrender, in view of
their ferocious and pitiless attacks on our merchant ships.</p>

<p>Destroyer versus Destroyer, as in the Dover Patrol, was fair game
and no favour. One could meet them and take them on as a decent
antagonist. But towards the submarine men, one felt an utter disgust
and loathing; they were nothing but an abomination, polluting the clean
sea.</p>

<p>We had made the usual rendezvous &ldquo;somewhere in the North
Sea.&rdquo; Picked up our Convoy and had got nearly down to the Tyne.
Forty odd ships, four Destroyers, six M.L.&rsquo;s, six armed trawlers,
one Convoy Leader and two Seaplanes. (The latter needed nearly as much
looking after as the ships, for they were forever coming to grief.) Up
until then we had not lost one ship, although there had been some
pretty sharp attacks. We were cruising steadily along when suddenly up
shot a periscope between the <i>Garry</i> and the <i>Destroyer</i>,
zigzagging off the leading ships, just where he <i>would</i> come up to
take his shot. Instantly the order was given &ldquo;Full speed,
Action.&rdquo; The <i>Garry</i> leapt ahead of where we had sighted him
and down went the first Depth Charge, almost immediately followed with
a second, a third, and a fourth.</p>

<p>Had he fired? Would we see that terrific column of water leap up
alongside one of our ships, to be followed by that metallic, clanging
crash, signaling the doom of yet another victim to one of these
unsporting beasts. Suddenly the lookout on the searchlight platform
bellowed at the top of his voice: &ldquo;Submarine breaking surface on
the port quarter, sir.&rdquo; Sure enough, our last Depth Charge had
brought him up. &ldquo;Hard aport. Submarine red one&mdash;two-o. Five
hundred yards. Independent, Open Fire.&rdquo; Having set that ball
rolling, I then turned my attention to the good old <i>Garry</i>. By
now she was dancing up to her 20 knots and swinging her head round in
the direction of the enemy. Would he come to the surface and retaliate
with his heavier metal, or would he submerge before we could get at
him. The forward 12-pdr. settled the question as to whether he would or
could submerge, by a direct hit at the base of his conning tower. Now
the other guns were getting the range, but so far, what with the ship
swinging so rapidly and increasing speed, accurate shooting was
impossible. Now the submarine was coming still more to the surface.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall get him. Steady the helm. Steer straight at him
Coxswain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; comes the quiet reply and the
<i>Garry</i> tears through the water with ever-increasing speed.</p>

<p>Four, three, two hundred yards. At one hundred the order was,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prepare to ram.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, with a crash, we are on him. Now there is no question about
losing him. All the same it was a glancing blow, though it has ripped
our own bows wide open. Has it ripped him up sufficiently to put him
out of action?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard-aport, Coxswain.&rdquo; And round we go again.</p>

<p>Shall I risk another run at him , as he is still showing up on the
surface? I knew the <i>Garry&rsquo;s</i> bows must have been seriously
damaged and mainly under water. Still, at all costs, he must not
escape, so, once again we race through the water and settle the matter
by hitting again and this time ripping her up completely and ourselves
as well. Down went &ldquo;U ll0" where she belonged,
(last&mdash;according to Von Lucknow&mdash;to be sunk in the war) and
down we went by the bows.</p>

<p>I left the rescue work to the others, who picked up fifteen out of
the water and then took stock of the damage we had sustained. No doubt
it was serious and the vital question now was, should we beach her,
make for the nearest port, or should we chance it and try and get back
to our base in the Humber?</p>

<p>After holding a council of war we decided that we might just about
be able to float long enough if we proceeded slowly stern first
throughout the night, for the hundred odd miles that lay between us and
the Spurn. Having made the decision we started off, but that night
stands out as one of the most anxious nights I have ever put in and I
have had a few.</p>

<p>If I got her back and rounded off the job, so much to the good and
all the more credit. If she couldn&rsquo;t float and I had to beach
her, she would probably be pounded to pieces and I should be blamed for
not making for the nearest port. If she sank out of hand I should get
soundly scrubbed for the same reason&mdash;and heaven alone help me if
I lost any lives in the process.</p>

<p>Well, we tommed down the forward mess decks above where the bottom
had been ripped out, shored up bulkheads, and hoped for the best. We
could make just 8 knots, and signaled our base to that effect,
&ldquo;Returning under own power stern first eight knots.&rdquo; The
signal that we had rammed twice and sunk a submarine had already gone
through and, as I was told afterwards, the Engineer-Admiral brought all
his influence to bear for us to be ordered into the Tyne. His
contention being that having rammed the submarine twice, we
couldn&rsquo;t possibly float all through the night let alone navigate
her back to the Humber. Naturally the Admiral and Captain
&ldquo;D&rdquo; wanted her back and , as thy told me later, &ldquo;they
knew I would get her back if I could and anyway I had been long enough
at sea to decide for myself just what was best to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a very doubtful best, but we did it and daylight in the
morning saw us rounding the Spurn, where two tugs were waiting to help
us limp back to dock.</p>

<p>By the time we got her into dock her bow was deep down in the water
and her stern cocked up in the air. Water was well over the mess decks
and the last bulkhead was bulging ominously. If that went, we went. A
carriage and pair might have driven through the gap in her bows where
the armour plated conning tower of the submarine had caught her.</p>

<p>Of course, everybody was very nice. Congratulations and decorations
all round. Mine was promotion and a bar to the D.S.C. All hands were
given a welcome bit of leave, whilst the <i>Garry</i> was placed in dry
dock, where the dockyard maties simply ran round the crumpled bow with
oxo-acetelyne flames and cut it right off.</p>

<p>Within a very few weeks the new bow was on, the last coat of paint
was dry, stores on board and once again she was ready for sea&mdash;not
a trace of the war scar left.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t go to sea with her, but transferred command to a
bigger ship in Portsmouth then fitting out for Special Service.</p>

<p>As it turned out, I didn&rsquo;t take this ship to sea either, for
the War ended abruptly. Guns were secured and warheads came off
torpedoes.</p>

<p>The excitement of the fight was over and ships proceeded &ldquo;On
their lawful occasions&rdquo; unmolested.</p>

<p>No more convoying needed. No more attacks to stave off. Salt had
gone out of the Service, the crazy War was ended and conditions changed
in a night. Then why hang it out? Common sense said, go while the
going&rsquo;s good. Leave whilst the flavour of excitement still
remains&mdash;don&rsquo;t wait till the taste grows stale.</p>

<p>Despite remarks of, &ldquo;Why this unseemly haste?&rdquo; Within a
week I had paid off my ship, demobbed and reported &ldquo;Back for
Duty&rdquo; with the Greyhounds of the Atlantic, back to the White Star
Line.<br>

<h3>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</h3>

<h4>I &ldquo;BURY THE ANCHOR&rdquo;</h4>

<p>I found things a bit raw in the Merchant Service and discipline more
than a bit ragged, mainly due to the exigencies of War.</p>

<p>Merchant Service Men were thoroughly fed up with being made stool
pigeons for everyone and anyone to shoot at. They had suffered terribly
and far more than was either necessary or right. The losses had been
frightful and the sufferings more awful than can well be conceived.
There was some element of truth in the saying that &ldquo;Men went into
the Navy for Safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was appointed to the <i>Celtic</i> and my hands were full for a
couple of voyages, licking her into shape. The men were completely out
of hand&mdash;although that did not trouble me much. I&rsquo;d handled
them all my life and my sympathies were wholly theirs, so we soon found
common ground.</p>

<p>Very quickly, in fact all too quickly for my liking, she settled
down into a steady routine, with a splendid, hard-working crew.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because I brought back no Navy ideas to the old
Merchant Service, that enabled us to see eye to eye. The fact remains,
she went through her transmogrification as quickly as any ship of the
Line and with the least trouble.</p>

<p>Once steadied down in the regular run, life dropped into its same
old grooves.</p>

<p>On the English side the memories of war were an open sore. On the
American side thee were still busy winning it. It was quite amusing, in
a way, to hear how pat everyone had the figures of the huge amounts the
U.S.A. had sent to &ldquo;Yurrup.&rdquo; So many millions of shell, so
many millions of bully-beef&mdash;both classed in much the same
category.</p>

<p>They were still three thousand miles distant from the War.</p>

<p>After a time one got used to the child-like simplicity with which
they made statements that showed, only too well that they had never
even been on the fringe of the Fight.</p>

<p>For my part, the peace time routine palled and it was only a few
short months before I decided to have done with it and seek some
excitement ashore&mdash;I got it all right, but that has nothing to do
with this story.</p>

<p>There used to be a fine picture in the front of old Todd and
Whall&rsquo;s Seamanship (a book familiar to all apprentices) when
first I went to sea. It was a picture of the s.s. <i>Celtic</i>, the
old <i>Celtic</i> of the White Star Line, driving her way to westward.
A big fourmaster with twin funnels and somehow I got to look on her as
the height and summit of my ambition.</p>

<p>Years passed. Ships came and ships went. Now one Company and now
another. Off on the trail and back to sea. The war blazed up and burned
out. Yet it was a curious coincidence that for my last ship I should
find myself in the modern edition of my boyhood&rsquo;s ambition; the
R.M.S. <i>Celtic</i>. And it was in my cabin on board this ship that I
