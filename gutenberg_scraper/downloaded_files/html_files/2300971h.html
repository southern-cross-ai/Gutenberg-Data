<h2><a id="ch0"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="first">
THE following studies have been written during several years,
between longer works. They have nothing in common beyond the
writer's own tastes and inclinations.</p>

<p>Each subject was chosen because it aroused a considerable
interest in the writer. Two of the essays were contributed to
collections of such studies by various authors, two were given as
papers before the Royal Society of Literature, one at Leeds
University. "The Dutch Provinces" was written after a visit to the
Netherlands made some time ago. This has been revised and freed
from clerical errors but not brought "up-to-date," so it is not to
be taken in any way as a present-day guide to the Low
Countries.</p>

<p>This and the other studies have already pleased some readers,
and it is hoped that they may now prove of some interest to
others.</p>

<p>Some of the essays are efforts in the art of compression; the
author was allotted so many pages and into this frame had to fit a
portrait or a period.</p>

<p>Others were limited because they had to run to no more pages
than would suit a subject paper; others again have been expanded to
the limit of the author's interest and capacity.</p>

<p>This explanation is given because it may seem strange to the
reader that no more space is devoted to such a vast subject as
"Mary Stewart, Queen of Scotland," than to a forgotten poet like
Edward Young or a forgotten writer like Thomas Reynal.</p>

<p>No bibliographies or references have been given as it was felt
that these would weigh down a work not intended for the student but
for the general reader.</p>

<p>It would also have been a laborious undertaking to have given
even a brief list of authorities consulted, places visited, and
works of art studied, when materials were being collected for these
essays.</p>

<p>A careful revision of the text has been made since these studies
were first printed, but doubtless the reader's indulgence will have
to be asked for some errors of fact or judgment.</p>

<p>The writer's constant preoccupation with the past has led her
into many by-paths of history, art, and literature, and she has
found the obscure and the odd personalities as attractive as the
famous figures that do, however, prove, perhaps unfortunately,
difficult to resist.</p>

<p>Some of the subjects chosen in this collection are so well known
that it is impossible to think of an excuse for doing them again;
others are so little known that they afford, perhaps, but small
matter for interest.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, that there may be those who will find a
fresh treatment of the well known, and a bringing forward of the
little known, not without some merits, if only that of reviving
memories of some of the most celebrated characters in history and
that of attracting attention to some subjects that are often
overlooked, but that do reveal odd glimpses into the by-paths of
history.</p>

<p>Some very short pieces of fiction are inserted in the "Three
Dutch Provinces"; they were inspired by Dutch paintings and
represent the author's reactions to Dutch history and art.</p>

<p class="first">
IN March, 1212, Frederic of Sicily sailed up the Tiber with a
small retinue; landing at Rome, he paid homage to the Pope,
Innocent III, in the sumptuous palace of the Lateran.</p>

<p>This visitor to the city of the Caesars had come to claim the
heritage of the Caesars; he was on his way north to assume
sovereignty over that chaotic Empire which papal gratitude had
bestowed on Carolus Magnus; revived by Otto the Great, it had been
carried to a height of splendid pretension by the House of
Hohenstaufen, of which this Sicilian prince, the son of the Emperor
Henry VI and grandson of the redoubtable Frederic I, called
Barbarossa, was the heir.</p>

<p>His mother was Costanzia, heiress of the rich and elegant
kingdoms of Sicily and Naples, and this Frederic had been born on
Christmas Day, 1194, at Iesi, in Apulia, while his father was
celebrating the advent of the Prince of Peace by the atrocious
massacre of the family and followers of the rebel Tancred; before
Frederic was three years old this grim tyrant had died and his
widow had put the defenceless boy under the guardianship of the
Pope, who took the occasion to seal a hard bargain with her, which
included the vassalage of her paternal lands and a yearly tribute
to the throne of St. Peter.</p>

<p>Even the dearly-bought protection of the Holy Father could not,
however, secure the Empire to the grandson of Barbarossa, though
the Electors of Germany had sworn to Henry VI to elect his son as
his successor, and since the time of Otto the Great it had been
understood that the imperial crown was to go to the prince chosen
by his peers to be king of Germany.</p>

<p>Not only had Frederic been ignored in the competition for this
splendid crown, which had been bestowed on his uncle, Philip of
Hohenstaufen, by the majority of the Electors and on Otto of Guelf,
Duke of Brunswick, by the minority, but a confusion of civil war
had been stirred up in his native kingdom, so that the boy, left
motherless at four years of age, was often not only without a
realm, but without a home. The protection of the Pope had preserved
him from complete ruin and had secured him an education; Sicily was
subdued to some quietude and the young King married to Costanzia,
widow of the King of Hungary, and sister of the King of Aragon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for twelve years a struggle of hideous ferocity had
raged between Philip of Hohenstaufen and the Guelf, ending in the
success of Otto, who was rewarded with the imperial diadem; but
immediately afterwards the newly-elected Kaiser broke the oaths of
submission he had made to the Pope and proceeded to harry the lands
of the papal ward, this Frederic Hohenstaufen, King of Sicily and
rightful Caesar, now in Rome.</p>

<p>Innocent at once excommunicated the refractory Emperor and
fomented divisions in Germany, where the defeated Hohenstaufen
party was still powerful though subdued.</p>

<p>Otto hastened north from his Italian conquests to crush this
rebellion, and Innocent, as a counter-move, encouraged the young
Frederic to come from Palermo and assume the dignity of his
forefathers, in answer to the summons of the Electors who, weary of
the civil war, turned to the young Hohenstaufen for relief.</p>

<p>Such were the events that brought the grandson of Barbarossa to
the footstool of Innocent III in the early spring of 1212.</p>

<p>The high adventure to which Frederic had been summoned was
perilous and lofty, full of profound dangers, but with the greatest
prize in the world as a possible reward; he was reputed to be of a
soft and voluptuous temperament, given to elegant versifying and
idle pursuits in his warm southern kingdom where the traditions of
an ancient culture were decaying amid flowery fields, where yellow
marble temples dedicated to dead gods still stood amid the wild
vines, and where the dark groves of bay and olive, ilex and citron,
shadowed the meads that Theocritus had peopled with singing
shepherds.</p>

<p>Innocent, the shrewd, powerful man of the world, who grasped the
keys of St. Peter with as ferocious a grip as the terrible
Hildebrand himself, had been doubtful if this Sicilian born and
bred Hohenstaufen would be of any use to him in his struggle with
Otto of Brunswick; it was difficult for the Pope to find a prince
strong enough to hold together the unwieldy Empire of Carolus
Magnus, and at the same time meek enough to be the humble vassal of
Rome.</p>

<p>Frederic Hohenstaufen was now seventeen years old, and had been
three years married; when the papal forces had driven the Saracens
into the mountains in 1200, and restored some measure of peace to
Sicily, the Pope had installed the Archbishop of Taranto as tutor
to the King (then six years of age); this dignitary was assisted,
oddly enough, by infidel scholars and the boy's mind had been
formed by Mohammedan as well as Christian doctrines; he was
unusually accomplished in the liberal arts, but he had disclosed no
ambition, and apart from a piteous appeal to the sovereigns of
Europe, written when he was in great misery, at the age of eleven,
had made no attempt to interfere in the embroiled confusions of the
time.</p>

<p>This King of Sicily had embarked on his ambitious journey with
only a scanty following; most of the Sicilian nobles had preferred
the delights of their native country to an enterprise so dubious
and had not wished to see Sicily become an appanage of the Empire,
and when he appeared before the Pope it was with a mere retinue,
not an army, and a retinue clad in silk and adorned with Eastern
opulence.</p>

<p>Innocent hoped to put forward this brilliant boy as his
lieutenant in Christendom, a position in which the Popes had been
striving to put the Emperors since they bestowed the pompous
honours of the Caesars on the Frankish monarch who had steadied St.
Peter's tottering throne.</p>

<p>It had often seemed since then as if there was to be no peace in
Christendom until either Pope or Emperor was crushed, or until both
were united in common aims, welded into one vast authority, which
should subdue the world under the banner of the cross, protected by
the consolidated armies of Europe obedient to one supreme head, the
Emperor, who would be, in his turn, obedient to the Holy See.</p>

<p>Such was the ambition of the present successor of St. Peter, nor
was it an unmeaning or pretentious one for the Church that had kept
alive culture and learning, trade and art, during five centuries in
the East while Europe crashed in the West.</p>

<p>Europe was still in a state of confusion and required reducing
to order and colonising; learning and wisdom were mostly the
monopoly of the Church; it was therefore natural that the Popes
should become obsessed with the importance and splendour of their
task, sanctified as it was by the magnificent divine command, "See,
I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to
root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to
build, and to plant," and that they should passionately desire in
the greatest secular power, the Empire, which they had themselves
created, not an insolent rival, but a submissive ally.</p>

<p>Innocent III thought that he had found such an ally in the youth
he had protected and educated, who now knelt humbly before the grim
old man, reverently renewed the oaths of vassalage made by his
mother, and admitted the baseless claim that Innocent had advanced
for the over-lordship of Sicily and Naples.</p>

<p>The Pope for his part provided the imperial pretender with men
and money and gave his dangerous enterprise the sanction of the
Church.</p>

<p>The slim and serene youth then advanced northwards where a
deputy from the Electors had already been sent to warn the great
Lombard towns of the coming of the rightful heir of the Caesars,
the king of Germany, of Sicily, the duke of Suabia and Emperor
elect.</p>

<p>The bearer of these proud titles had a difficult journey before
him; the country was infested with his enemies, and Otto of
Brunswick, though deposed by the Electors and excommunicated by the
Pope, was still powerful and counted many of the princes of Germany
among his friends, nor was he likely to relinquish his gorgeous
prize without a renewal of the struggle to which fourteen years of
most bloody warfare had habituated him.</p>

<p>The summons of the Diet had come from Nuremberg in the previous
October, and Frederic's objective was the heart of Germany; between
him and that lay the Italian and German States, many of whom were
either Guelf in sympathy or at war with one another.</p>

<p>Frederic did not hesitate before these rampant perils; he pushed
forward to his goal with a daring that was as heartening to his
friends as it was menacing to his enemies.</p>

<p>His character was not yet completely disclosed; it was known
that he was intelligent and accomplished, and it had been just seen
that he was as ambitious and daring as befitted his descent, easily
the most illustrious in the West.</p>

<p>His present undertaking was quite in accordance with the spirit
of a restless, tumultuous age, and the glory of his name seemed
likely to be linked to the glory of his achievements.</p>

<p>The blend of the German and the Sicilian had produced in
Frederic one who was not typical of either race; the boy who was
galloping across Italy to his imperial throne was slight, almost
effeminate in appearance, with a profusion of reddish blond hair,
small features, a pale complexion, and light eyes of a singular
brightness and clarity; his face had been compared to the calm
countenance of the broken statues of Apollo that here and there
lingered in ruined shrines in Sicily; but, if his features had
something of classic beauty and cold composure, his appointments
were Eastern in luxury and profusion; he paraded sumptuously in the
embroideries, the jewelled arms, the gleaming silks and fine
velvet, the erect plumes and the gold-studded leathers of the
East.</p>

<p>Pisa, which sided with the Guelf, barred the young adventurer's
way, but Pisa's enemy, Genoa, received him; he remained in this
opulent and stately city for two months, while his adherents
endeavoured to secure for him some way into Germany other than the
obvious route through Milan and the Alps, for the mighty Lombard
city was unflinchingly loyal to the Guelf.</p>

<p>Frederic made at last for Pavia, where he was warmly acclaimed,
slipped secretly by night to Cremona through a hostile region,
gained Mantua, Verona, and from there the Bavarian frontier, having
escaped, by the narrowest margin, death or capture at the hands of
his swarming enemies.</p>

<p>His following was reduced now to a meagre train and the greatest
perils were in front of him; Otto barred the way across Bavaria,
but the Emperor elect showed that judicious blend of caution and
daring, that power to judge swiftly and prudently, to act bravely
and warily, which stamp the great leader of men; the luxurious and
elegant prince, used only to the soft pleasures of Sicily, turned
to the West and proceeded through the snow-bound passes of the
Alps, smilingly endured the hardships of the progress through the
almost impassable defiles, and came out, still elegant and
composed, in his own Duchy of Suabia, where he was joined by some
notable churchmen, the Bishop of Coire, and the Abbot of St.
Gall.</p>

<p>The splendid city of Constance, towering above her vivid, vast
lake, now became the pivot of the contest; the Guelf threatened
this gateway to Frederic's progress northwards, hoping to occupy
the town and from this base to drive the daring boy back into
Italy.</p>

<p>But Frederic was always surpassingly swift, he dashed on
Constance, reached the walls while Otto was a few miles away, and
imperiously demanded the loyalty and support of the Bishop of
Constance, an ancient adherent of the House of Suabia.</p>

<p>He was admitted into the city, the gates were closed in the face
of Otto, who fell back northwards disheartened, and the
Hohenstaufen had won the Holy Roman Empire.</p>

<p>Frederic marched triumphantly to Basle, nearly all the German
potentates hastened to share his success, his train swelling to
majestic proportions as he advanced, brilliant, smiling, serene,
into the heart of his new kingdom.</p>

<p>He now disclosed his latent genius; preserving the serene
equanimity of a lofty mind, he remained as unmoved by the dazzling
conclusion of his adventure as he had been by its dubious
beginning, and proceeded to consolidate his position by lavish
rewards to his German friends and by an alliance with France, whose
enemy, the crafty Angevin, John of England, favoured the cause of
Otto, his nephew.</p>

<p>Philip Augustus celebrated this treaty with a munificent gift of
money, which Frederic, with prudent generosity, proceeded to divide
among the Electors and princes of Germany.</p>

<p>At Mainz he held a Diet, at Frankfort he was crowned by the
hands of the Papal Legate in the presence of all the Teutonic
potentates and five thousand loyal knights.</p>

<p>This was in December, 1212; it was less than a year since
Frederic had left Sicily, almost unattended, and now he had
achieved the summit of all possible worldly human ambition; he was
the Emperor, the heir of the Caesars and of Carolus Magnus, the
chief of the Holy Roman Empire, which the men who had elected him
believed had been "set up by God Almighty, that its Lord, like God
on Earth, might rule Kings and Nations and maintain Peace and
Justice."</p>

<p>He was not yet quite eighteen years old and he had been set up
"like a God on Earth," the temporal chief of Christendom.</p>

<p>He ruled directly over the entire area of Germany, Austria, the
Netherlands, nearly all Belgium, and the kingdom of Arles (France
to the Rhone) and Northern Italy, and theoretically he was "the
lord of the whole world"; Sicily and Southern Italy were his
through his mother, and Poland and Hungary were tributary to him;
no youth had ever before wielded, or was ever again to wield, so
vast and real a power; his empire exceeded that of Alexander of
Macedonia, and almost equalled that of Rome at the apogee of its
glory.</p>

<p>The next few years were a glittering, triumphal progress for
Frederic Hohenstaufen; he swept through Germany with his
resplendent following of kings, bishops, nobles, routed out the
supporters of Otto, who fled into his ancestral territories of
Brunswick, and rewarded his vassals with the same smiling calm with
which he crushed the partisans of the Guelf; his fame became
unprecedented, unbounded.</p>

<p>John of England, allied with the Earl of Flanders, rashly took
up the cause of Otto, his sister's son, but was utterly defeated by
Philip Augustus at the battle of Bouvines, a defeat that caused
England to lose Normandy; and after this final overthrow of the
Guelf, Aix-la-Chapelle surrendered to Frederic, who, seated on the
throne of Carolus Magnus, was sumptuously crowned for the second
time.</p>

<p>He had already taken a vow of obedience to the Pope and
recompensed him for his assistance by gifts of land in Central
Italy and the surrender of various rights to the Church in Sicily,
as well as by the cession of some disputed estates in Tuscany. He
now, with the silver crown of Germany on his head, the Cross in his
hand, and anointed with the holy oil, made a further concession to
the known desires of the Papacy.</p>

<p>He swore to lead a crusade to the Holy Land, and with his
beauty, his power, his obvious sincerity he moved the packed
multitudes, who had just thrice shouted assent to his stupendous
elevation, to excited enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Frederic was now in a position almost beyond the limits of human
ambition and almost beyond human capacity to maintain; he, who had
been an obscure, petty king, whose childhood had been passed in
poverty and confusion, neglect and peril, found himself elevated to
supreme power over all his fellows, and this at twenty years of
age.</p>

<p>It was, of course, a height as dangerous as it was magnificent
to which he had climbed; despite the prestige of his birth and the
solid advantage of papal support, a single weakness in himself
might have at once hurled him to ruin. He had to be bold and wary,
daring and prudent, at once loved and feared, to hold together,
even for a moment, his huge and divided empire; nor was he, at
first sight, the type of man to rule successfully warlike and
impetuous peoples; the fair and slender youth, trained in southern
luxury, had nothing of the powerful presence, the fierce and
overwhelming masculinity that had made his forefathers the natural
lords of warriors.</p>

<p>His appearance, his manners, and his tastes might well have
seemed effeminate to the rough and burly Germans who crowded round
the eagles, but Frederic was easily and without dispute their
superior; by reason of his intellect and character he was a born
master of men, and with this native genius for governance were
combined a personal charm, an attraction, a fascination of word and
look, too seldom seen with genius, too often the attributes of the
shallow and the worthless.</p>

<p>Frederic's Sicilian blood had tempered the grand virile
qualities of the Hohenstaufen with a silken grace, an exquisite
tact, a delicate courtesy that even the sullen or the ill-affected
could not resist; added to these was the serenity of conscious
greatness; Frederic never met his equal in worldly rank, nor his
equal in intellectual attainments, he was by genius, as well as
position, the foremost man of his time.</p>

<p>This air of calm power, this smiling, but indifferent
amiability, this equable, finished elegance of manner, together
with his accomplishments and his learning, masking an indomitable
will, combined to give him a power as tremendous as that enjoyed by
the greatest of his ancestors, and a wider fame.</p>

<p>He was exceedingly popular with every rank of the Germans, who
saw in him the Emperor who would restore to them that ordered
prosperity which they had enjoyed for a short while under the
earlier Hohenstaufen, and which had lately been lost in the
disputes between the factions of the Guelf and Ghibelline.</p>

<p>Frederic increased this popularity by a lavish and impartial
generosity, Oriental in munificence, and further bound the Germans
to his service by an open-handed distribution of grants,
privileges, and dignities, which in truth cost him but little,
since these petty potentates had long since seized the chance
afforded them by the perpetual disturbances in the Empire of
grasping at a certain amount of liberty for themselves.</p>

<p>A lesser man would now have proceeded to enjoy his triumph, so
complete and so unexpected, in pleasure and ease; this might have
naturally been Frederic's choice, for he had spent two toilsome
years since he had left the delights of Sicily and he was by nature
voluptuous and indolent; to one of his wide, alert mentality much
of the active world about him must have appeared contemptible or
ridiculous, and reading, meditation, the exercise of his gifts for
music and poetry, the indulgence of his delight in beauty and
grace, in refined and elegant diversions, made a strong appeal
indeed.</p>

<p>But Frederic Hohenstaufen looked beyond his personal
gratification; he saw the world spread before him, struggling into
some semblance of law and order, system forming out of chaos, peace
trembling on the heels of war, and he believed that he might make
these things permanent, that, out of the confusion and darkness
that had eclipsed Europe since the disruption of the Roman Empire,
he might create an empire as mighty and united as that of the
Caesars, but more secure, since it would include the power of those
peoples, the barbarians, who had overthrown the ancient power, and
the influence of that new God who had overthrown the ancient
gods.</p>

<p>No one could have conceived a more lofty ambition, or seen the
task to his hand on a wider scale, and no one could have devoted
himself to his work with greater single-mindedness, with more
profound wisdom.</p>

<p>Such men as Frederic are always accused of personal ambition;
this charge is but the croaking of the frogs in the marsh that
follows the flight of the bird across the sky, the spiteful
jealousy of the little souls that remain in the mud because they
have no wings to fly with.</p>

<p>It is not possible for a man of supreme intellect in a position
of supreme power to feel the cringing humility of the mediocre mind
having but little authority, or to doubt and depreciate himself as
if he were a dreaming philosopher or a cloistered monk; such a man
as Frederic Hohenstaufen faced even his God on equal terms, and if
he saw the world like a jewel of silver and lapis lazuli hung at
his belt for his adornment, he saw it in no spirit of petty
arrogance, but with an ironic appreciation of his own supremacy in
a crude, violent, ignorant age.</p>

<p>With deliberate abnegation of his own desires, he flashed
through the dark forests, the heavy towns, the wide meadows of
Germany, with his train of troubadours and dancers and scholars and
glittering knights, a sparkling pageant under these cold skies,
among this uncivilised, turbulent people, whose laws, customs, and
possessions were alike in one rude confusion.</p>

<p>The fair, smiling Emperor held his Diet in city after city,
travelled from castle to castle, received submission after
submission from towns and feudal barons, administered swift
justice, granted charters for the revival of trade and agriculture,
threw the protection of his power over the weak, and hurled the
wrath of his power against the oppressor; he was a despot whose
will might never be questioned, but the reviving prosperity of the
country, the gratitude of those he had protected and those he had
enriched, the deep impression made by his personal charm and
beauty, and the bright splendour of his mind, caused universal
admiration and applause, not only throughout the Empire, but
throughout the world.</p>

<p>Encouraged by these awestruck praises, Frederic proceeded to
confirm the House of Hohenstaufen in imperial power; he sent for
his wife and little son, Henry, from Sicily, and, at the Diet of
Frankfort in 1220, used all his influence to persuade the Electors
to choose the latter, already duke of Suabia and ruler of Burgundy,
as the future king of Germany.</p>

<p>Frederic, by thus associating his son with himself in the
government and by securing for him the succession to the Empire,
had achieved a personal triumph and openly flouted the Pope, whose
main object was to prevent the aggrandisement of the Emperor and
the Hohenstaufen.</p>

<p>This glittering success cost Frederic but little, so great were
his prestige and popularity; he certainly gave his obedient princes
charters, which were the first sanction of the disruption of the
Empire, but these, like his former concessions, were but a
confirmation of privileges long enjoyed, which it would have been
dangerous, if not impossible, to rescind.</p>

<p>Frederic, besides this affront to the papal authority, had
further irritated Rome by his reluctance to fulfil the oath taken
at his coronation in Aix-la-Chapelle; and this would have doubtless
led to an open breach with Rome, had not the fiery Innocent III
died and been succeeded by a mild spirit, Honorius HI, whose feeble
protests were received by Frederic with courteous indifference, and
specious excuses not untinged with irony.</p>

<p>The Emperor, having restored order and roused loyalty in
Germany, soothed the Pope and secured the reversion of his
dignities to his son, turned his attention to his Italian
possessions, and in August, 1220, crossed the Alps again and
descended into Lombardy at the head of a sumptuous cavalcade of
Teutonic knights; such gorgeous and massive potentates as the Duke
of Bavaria, the Margrave of Hohenburg, the Count Palatine, and the
Archbishops of Mainz and Ravenna added to the imposing display of
pomp and power that glorified Frederic Hohenstaufen, now, at
twenty-six years of age, the foremost man in the world, and
enjoying a popularity that was probably beyond that ever accorded
to any other prince and that he had won by his own personal
qualities, his justice, his affability, his prudence, his lively
grace and dazzling accomplishments, his tolerant patronage of all
types of intelligence and effort, his wide view of all questions of
the moment.</p>

<p>While he had been consolidating his power in Germany, the great
towns of North Italy had fallen into strife, the Guelfs revenging
themselves on the Church that had protected the Ghibellines by
seizing her property and expelling her prelates; Frederic glanced
aside from this bewildering confusion and proceeded to Rome, where
he was splendidly crowned Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in the
gorgeous basilica of St. Peter with all the pomp with which the
Church dignified her most important ceremonies.</p>

<p>The blond and elegant Emperor, simply arrayed in spotless white
amid a company resplendent with every device of worldly pageantry,
received from the Holy Father the beautiful insignia of his
stupendous office, the Cross, the Lance, the Sceptre, the Golden
Apple, all symbols of various aspects of the power with which the
vicar of Christ invested his lieutenant.</p>

<p>Frederic did not receive these supreme honours without having to
make some return for them; he paid homage to the Pope, he held his
stirrup while he mounted for the procession through the city where
the Emperor rode behind the Pontiff, he abased himself to kiss the
jewelled slipper of Honorius, and, most important of all, he took
the Cross from the hands of Cardinal Ugolino and repeated his vow
of six years ago to lead a crusade against the infidel&mdash;adding on
this occasion the promise to sail the following August.</p>

<p>Goodwill was now complete between the two heads of Christendom,
and Frederic, by no means dazzled with the glitter of the
gem-encrusted imperial diadem now added to his treasure chests,
proceeded to engage in several weeks of laborious business; he
issued many edicts to various cities, made many appointments, and
sent out many manifestos to various provinces of his scattered
realms; many of these were certainly concessions to papal authority
and measures of precautions against his enemies, the Guelfs, but
with them were associated schemes of betterment for the general
populace, protection for farmers, travellers, and traders, and
provisions against the robber and the rogue.</p>

<p>There is no reason whatever to doubt the sincerity of the
Emperor in these decrees, or to suspect that they were merely the
price of preferment received; it was natural for him to associate
Christianity with law, order, and progress, and to regard the papal
authority as the main support and hope of the future peace and
enlightenment he had himself so much at heart, and the stern laws
he promulgated against heretics must have seemed to him
necessary curbs on the rebellious and the lawless. But a cloud was
soon to arise between Emperor and Pope.</p>

<p>Frederic proceeded to his beloved Sicily and found confusion
there, as was likely in a kingdom left too long without a king; in
restoring his authority and punishing the refractory he showed a
sterner haughtiness than he had as yet disclosed, and among those
whom he deprived of ill-gotten honours or dubiously gained estates
were several priests and churches.</p>

<p>The immediate remonstrance of Honorius was received impatiently
by Frederic, who declared, without a trace of the submission that
he had shown in Rome, "that I would rather lay down my Crown than
lessen my authority." He repudiated the compact between his
helpless mother and the unscrupulous Innocent III and proceeded to
exercise the ancient privileges of the Sicilian kings.</p>

<p>With sharp justice and cold and implacable severity he put down
his rebellious subjects, then led a force against the Saracens
still lodged in the western mountains of the island, signally
defeated them, hanged their leader, and transported twenty thousand
of their finest fighting men to Apulia, where he ejected the
Christians from Lucera and established the Moslems in their place,
allowing them to use the cathedral as a mosque: these Saracens were
to serve as a colony of warriors for the defence of the Empire.</p>

<p>This action revealed to the papal power the manner of man it had
to deal with; for this superb piece of bold statesmanship whereby
rebels were turned into loyal soldiers (of the finest type of
fighting men) was conceived and executed with a haughty defiance of
Church, tradition, and public opinion, hitherto unknown.</p>

<p>The character of Frederic had developed since his first
coronation; his expanding genius was no longer to be curbed by
convention, nor hampered by the fears, doubts, and restrictions
that control small minds; in the growing maturity of his powers he
became intolerant of all restraints, impatient of any superior
authority, he revealed that he was fierce, bold, cruel, and superb
as a beast of prey beneath his smiling amiability, his gracious
charm, his ready tact, and as self-assured and indomitable as one
must be who looks abroad and sees no equal. No other prince, since
the Church had been established in Europe, had flung such an
affront in her face as Frederic had now done in setting up this
Saracen colony, established at the expense of Christians.</p>

<p>A superstitious age was profoundly shocked, and even the mild
Honorius was moved to an indignant protest.</p>

<p>Frederic replied with that ironic contempt for an opponent which
is generally described as duplicity; he said that, Moslems being of
no account in comparison with Christians, it was better that they
should be employed in the dangerous occupation of war.</p>

<p>Honorius must have detected the fallacy of this answer and the
arrogance that prompted it, he must have realised the immense power
this Moslem army, not amenable to the usual threat of
excommunication, gave to the Emperor, and the menace to papal
prestige that such an action and such an excuse concealed; but he
gave way, out of the weariness of old age and the timidity of a
gentle nature, and renewed his plaintive efforts to induce the
Emperor to undertake the crusade to which he had twice pledged
himself with all solemnity.</p>

<p>The crusades were, in every way, to the advantage of the Popes;
not only were they excellent demonstrations of the might, loyalty,
and religious zeal of the Christian princes, not only did they
provoke outbursts of hysterical enthusiasm for the Church, but they
exhausted those resources which might have been turned against the
Papacy, and involved the kings and warriors of Europe in warfare
with the infidel and with one another, which allowed them no
leisure to question papal supremacy, or to resist papal
encroachments.</p>

<p>But Frederic had no mind to weaken himself in this way, he had
no animus against the Saracens, and no vivid enthusiasm for
Christianity; he visualised an empire united under a rule of
tolerance where all sects, races, and creeds might work together
for a common splendour of progress.</p>

<p>No doubt his first oath was sincere, if the second was forced,
but it was the oath of a boy of twenty given at a moment of
unparalleled success, and, as Frederic developed, the crusades must
have appeared to him fantastic and boyish adventures unfitted for a
man of genius. He did not love fighting and hardship as warriors
like Richard Coeur de Lion had loved them, exploits of personal
bravery had no attraction for him, though he was absolutely
fearless; he was too subtle, too fine for crude and aimless
exploits.</p>

<p>Like Robert the Bruce after Bannockburn, he looked abroad on his
own realms and saw that much needed doing there before any fanciful
expeditions in the East could be undertaken; but, unlike the
Scottish king, he relinquished the fulfilment of his oath without
any passionate regret or any deep remorse.</p>

<p>He, however, sent an almost constant supply of soldiers to the
East, and sumptuously entertained in his profane Sicilian Court all
warriors of the Cross and pious pilgrims journeying to and from
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>In the year 1222 he ordered a fleet of forty galleys to go to
the support of the Christians under King John of Jerusalem, who had
just made the notable capture of Damietta.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the Emperor, his galleys arrived only in time
to see the city retaken by the infidel and to learn that the
triumphant Sultan had imposed a truce of eight years upon King
John, softening this by a gracious present of a portion of the true
Cross.</p>

<p>The whole of Europe was darkened by the shadow of this
humiliation, and the gentle Honorius was inspired to threaten
Frederic with excommunication if he did not undertake in person the
task of reviving the prestige of Christendom.</p>

<p>Frederic was, however, little moved, he continued to occupy
himself with his own affairs and, at two meetings with the Pope, at
Veroli and Fiorentino, he induced the aged Pontiff to agree to
further delays.</p>

<p>On these occasions Frederic met John, crusader King of
Jerusalem, and betrothed himself to this old warrior's daughter
Yolande, the Spanish Empress having died the previous year; Yolande
was heiress to the crown of Jerusalem, so Frederic had now a
personal interest in the prospect of undertaking a crusade.</p>

<p>This, however, seemed no nearer than before; not only Frederic,
but Europe, listened coldly to the papal expostulations and
exhortations; neither England nor France nor Italy nor Germany
could be roused to the old reckless excitement, and Cardinal
Ugolino, who had handed the Cross to Frederic when he took his
second oath, endeavoured in vain to rouse Lombardy to
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The Pope was not to be easily thwarted in a matter so nearly
touching his own interests, and he pestered Frederic until the
Emperor agreed to sail in August, 1227, and to maintain a thousand
knights in Palestine for two years; the Pope asked, this time, for
a guarantee for the fulfilment of this oath, and Frederic agreed to
pay, in instalments, 100,000 ounces of gold to the King and
Patriarch of Jerusalem; not only was he to forfeit this if he
failed to go to the East, but he was also to be instantly
excommunicated.</p>

<p>It is probable that Frederic would not have agreed to these hard
terms had he not now been married to Yolande, heiress of Jerusalem;
this caused him to look on the crusades from another angle, that of
his own glory.</p>

<p>While the Pope thought he had bound the Emperor to his service,
the Emperor was resolving to use this expedition to gain yet
another kingdom for himself and perhaps indulging the daring dream
of adding the Empire of the East to the Empire of the West.</p>

<p>His first move in this direction was to deprive his
father-in-law of his kingly rank, which the doughty crusader only
held in virtue of his marriage with the Queen of Jerusalem, and
which legally reverted to Frederic; John de Brienne was furious at
this treatment but was unable to resist, and the Emperor now added
to his mighty honours that mystical, unsubstantial title, King of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Frederic, having now quieted both his German and his Italian
possessions, disposed of the internal menace of the Saracens in
Sicily, reduced the pretensions of the Church in his native
country, and, with bold, pitiless hands, crushed his enemies and
restored a fair measure of prosperity and tranquillity to these
portions of his scattered dominions, decided seriously to prepare
for an expedition to the East.</p>

<p>He went north, at Cremona summoned a Diet and called on the
Italian chivalry to meet him with the object of preparing for the
long-discussed crusade.</p>

<p>At the same time he summoned the boy Henry, his son, who was
maintaining the imperial authority beyond the Alps, to bring German
knights to assist in the holy expedition.</p>

<p>Lombardy was, however, entirely Guelf in sympathy and replied to
the Hohenstaufen commands with insults and menaces; Milan revived
the Lombard League, which had been first formed against Barbarossa,
Verona barred the way to King Henry so that he was forced to return
to Germany, and all the great cities, Piacenza, Verona, Brescia,
Faenza, Mantua, combined to ruin the purpose of the Diet of Cremona
and to force Frederic, who was unaccompanied by an army, to retire
south.</p>

<p>The ban of the Empire and the ban of the Pope alike were hurled
at rebellious Lombardy, but with poor results; the utmost threats
could only induce the haughty and powerful cities to assist the
Ghibelline Emperor with four hundred knights.</p>

<p>In the March of the year (1227) that Frederic was pledged to
start for the East, Honorius III died, and the fierce and
enthusiastic Cardinal Ugolino was elected in his place under the
name of Gregory IX.</p>

<p>The struggle between Pope and Emperor, which had been so
intermittent and courteous between Frederic and Honorius, now began
in good earnest between Frederic and Gregory.</p>

<p>The tolerant Emperor had always admired the vast erudition, the
rigid asceticism, the brilliant eloquence of Cardinal Ugolino, but
Cardinal Ugolino had always detested the worldly, voluptuous, and
liberal Emperor, and his first act of papal authority showed the
outburst of a long-restrained spite against Frederic.</p>

<p>As he could say nothing about the crusade for which Frederic was
preparing with all speed, the grim old man of eighty, soured by
rigid monastic discipline, and without any of the softer human
passions or the more lovable human failings, administered a sharp
rebuke concerning the private life of the young, splendid, and
virile Emperor.</p>

<p>Frederic received this reprimand about his "earthly lusts" with
an indifference that appeared submission, his ironic smile gave the
measure of his appreciation of the gloomy and ferocious old
ascetic, and he continued his preparations for the long-deferred
crusade, which Gregory was already viewing with a hostile eye.</p>

<p>This crusade was disastrous from the first, none of the monarchs
of Europe offered any assistance whatever, and even Frederic's
immediate vassals were reluctant; the Duke of Austria refused his
support, and the Landgrave of Thuringia had to be heavily bribed;
in truth, the expedition was unpopular with everyone save the
priests.</p>

<p>By August, however, the Germans were embarking at Brindisi for
Acre in a heat so violent that the armour was melted on the
knights' backs and brows; the Northerners, unused to such a torrid
climate, succumbed by hundreds to fatigue and fever in the southern
port.</p>

<p>When Frederic arrived at Brindisi, he was himself ill; his
delicate but vigorous body, his superb health had given way under
unexampled strain and vexation; the journey under the blazing
skies, over the dry roads of an Italian summer, the continual
vexations, irritations, and disappointments of his enterprise, had
brought him to the verge of collapse; his doctors advised him to
abandon the expedition till the autumn.</p>

<p>But Frederic decided to persist in his resolution, not from any
desire to placate the new Pope, but because he was not easily to be
turned aside from anything he had undertaken.</p>

<p>The Christian hosts were ravaged by sickness, several of the
leaders were too stricken to leave Brindisi, but Frederic sailed.
After a few days at sea he became so seriously ill that his galley
was forced to return to Italy; the forty thousand Christians who
had already reached Acre returned when they heard that the Emperor
was not coming, and the long-promised crusade came to a disastrous
conclusion.</p>

<p>Frederic, slowly recovering from his nervous fever at Naples,
sent formal explanations of his failure to the Pope; but Gregory,
against reason, prudence, and justice, at once excommunicated the
Emperor, with all the terrors of book, candle, and bell, and with
all the zest of one who seizes a coveted opportunity of injuring an
enemy.</p>

<p>Gregory's ferocious action, followed as it was by a furious
diatribe against Frederic, full of bitter invective and
misrepresentation, addressed to the clergy, made an immediate and
deadly breach between Empire and Papacy and brought into the
conflict between these two powers the hideous elements of personal
hatred and jealousy.</p>

<p>If it must be admitted that the pretensions of the earlier Popes
had much justification in the services the Church had rendered to
civilisation, then struggling from tribal to national status, in
being a central authority and a powerful control, it cannot be
conceded that Gregory in treating a man like Frederic as an enemy,
and in endeavouring to crush a prince so splendid, so popular, and
so enlightened, showed the least spark of statesmanship or
foresightedness, of prudence or caution; his actions appear,
indeed, to have been inspired by a jealous spite, a petty
censoriousness, and by that half-crazed arrogance too often
characteristic of the occupants of the Chair of St. Peter, which
seems to show that the claim of divine authority is too apt to turn
the brain of a mortal man.</p>

<p>Frederic was probably expecting the eternal curses of the Pope
and received them with his ironic and indifferent smile; he ordered
the clergy in his dominions to ignore the excommunication (a
command they obeyed) and answered the manifesto of the Pope by
another, which he dispatched to all the monarchs of Europe.</p>

<p>In the letter he sent to the feeble son of the dastard John,
Henry III of England, he made a dauntless and superb attack on the
power of Rome, which showed him to be as bold as he was clear
sighted.</p>

<p>"Such is the way of Rome; under words as smooth as oil and honey
lies the rapacious blood-sucker; the Church of Rome is like a
leech...the whole world pays tribute to the avarice of Rome...the
primitive Church, founded on poverty and simplicity, brought forth
numberless Saints; she rested on no foundation but that laid down
by Our Lord Jesus Christ; Rome is now rolling in Wealth...Remember
that when your neighbour's wall is on fire, your own property is at
stake."</p>

<p>Frederic followed this vigorous appeal to the rulers of Europe
by prompt action against Gregory. He summoned the most powerful
families of Rome to his Court, bought their estates from them at
their own price, and returned them as fiefs; he was already so
popular in his enemy's stronghold that the people broke into St.
Peter's when Gregory was celebrating Mass, and showed themselves
such warm Ghibellines that the Pope was compelled to flee to
Perugia.</p>

<p>From this retreat the terrible old man hurled further
fulminations at the Emperor, forbidding him to undertake the
crusade while under the curse of the Church, but Frederic continued
his preparations and sailed from Otranto on June 29th, 1228, with a
train of only a hundred knights, for his treasury was nearly empty
and the crusade as unpopular as ever in Europe.</p>

<p>In the spring of that year his girl Empress, Yolande, died,
leaving a son, Conrad, and Frederic considered himself heir to her
crown of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>In September he arrived in Acre, leaving the world amazed at the
courage with which he ignored the excommunication, affronted the
Christian Church, and denied the infallibility of the Pope.</p>

<p>A large and motley force of Christians was assembled at Acre to
welcome him, the Templars and Hospitallers, the Teutonic Order,
founded by his grandfather, Barbarossa, and a fair number of
Lombards, Germans, French, and English.</p>

<p>Gregory, blinded by furious spite against the common good, sent
two Minorite friars into the Emperor's camp with the threat of
excommunication of all those who dared to follow the eagles; this
split Frederic's forces in half, the Templars, Hospitallers, and
many others refusing to follow one cursed by the Church; his tact
and popularity, however, brought these round to a reluctant
submission, and the Teutonic Knights, under the famous Hermann von
Salza, remained unwaveringly loyal.</p>

<p>Frederic marched to Jaffa with this disunited force, and there
displayed his genius by one of those actions with which he
continually amazed, shocked, and awed Europe. He had long been on
friendly terms with a leader of the Saracens, Sultan Kamel, and
from Acre had sent him lavish offerings, a compliment returned by
the gift of a camel and an elephant; emissaries went to and from
the camps of these two philosophical princes, exchanging
mathematical problems and philosophical disquisitions; to the
further scandal of the outraged fanatics who murmured in his train,
Frederic received from Kamel a bevy of Eastern dancing girls who
amused his brief leisure with their soft voices and languorous
poses.</p>

<p>Feeling ran so high against Frederic that the Templars actually
apprised the Sultan of a solitary expedition the Emperor proposed
to take to bathe in the waters of the Jordan, with the suggestion
that this would be an excellent opportunity for the assassination
of the excommunicated crusader.</p>

<p>The Sultan, however, sent the traitors' letters to Frederic, who
at the same time had intercepted one from the Pope to Kamel, urging
the latter to have no dealings with the Emperor.</p>

<p>Thus hampered, weakened, affronted, and threatened on every
side, not able to count on the loyalty of any but his Teutonic
Knights, and at the end of his money, Frederic was obliged to lower
the first demands he had made on behalf of Christendom and to
accept the best terms he could wring from an opponent fully
conscious of his difficulties.</p>

<p>That these terms were not entirely unsatisfactory was a high
tribute to the genius of the harassed Emperor; by the nine articles
of the Ten Years' Truce he signed, February, 1229, he obtained more
than any crusader had obtained since 1099, when Jerusalem was first
captured; the Holy City was now returned to Christendom, and most
of the articles were concessions from the Sultan to the
Emperor.</p>

<p>This bloodless success of the sixth crusade was entirely owing
to the genius of Frederic; single-handed and in face of most
exasperating difficulties he had won, by sheer force of character
and intellect, more solid advantages for Christians than the
flamboyant exploits of generations of previous kings had been able
to accomplish.</p>

<p>It is obvious that had he been supported by the Pope his success
would have been overwhelming; such as it was, it remained an
amazing proof of his high qualities of statesmanship and the charm
of his subtle personality, which had a peculiar fascination for the
Oriental mind; for the first time the Moslem met a cultured and
tolerant Christian and also for the last, for though Louis IX was a
courteous saint he was also a fanatic.</p>

<p>This treaty, so greatly to the advantage of the Syrian
Christians, was received by the Papacy with a howl of fury, and
Gerold, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, the Papal Legate, was
instructed to thwart and oppose Frederic in every way possible,
while a papal army marched into Apulia under Frederic's
father-in-law, John de Brienne, and the banner of the Keys was
raised as a rallying point for all the malcontents of the
Empire.</p>

<p>Frederic heard this news without surprise, nor did it send him
hot haste home; he probably saw that a Christian kingdom in Syria
was a chimerical vision, and that the days of the crusades were
over, as indeed they proved to be, for, despite the impetuous piety
of Louis IX, these wasteful invasions of the East dragged on only
for another half-century.</p>

<p>But Frederic wished to be crowned in Jerusalem, his own kingdom,
and hither he repaired, the fanatic Gerold at his heels, repeating
the ban on every available occasion and finally laying the Holy
City itself under an interdict during the accursed Emperor's
presence there.</p>

<p>The superb Frederic, however, crowned himself with his own hands
in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, surrounded by his loyal
Teutonic Knights, and during his short stay in Jerusalem showed
himself not only tolerant but favourable to the Saracens; he
forbade a Christian priest to enter the mosque of Omar, he ordered
the <i>muezzin,</i> silenced out of deference to him, to proclaim
the hours again, and when he saw the gratings over the windows of
the Holy Chapel, he remarked, with his serene irony:</p>

<p>"Ye may keep out the birds, but how shall ye keep out the
swine?"</p>

<p>He proceeded, immediately after his last coronation, to Acre,
where his conduct gave further cause for scandal to the faithful
Papists; while he was amusing himself with Eastern culture and
Eastern luxuries, he kept the odious Gerold prisoner in his own
house, filled the churches with German archers, and caused rabid
friars, who had insulted him, to be flogged.</p>

<p>Then, denouncing the mean and short-sighted treachery of Gerold
and the Templars, the Emperor, still preserving his disdainful
patience, dismissed the crusaders and sailed from Acre, followed by
the curses of the priests whose Faith he had come to uphold and
whose Founder's tomb he had restored to Christian care.</p>

<p>With the arrival of Frederic in Brindisi in June, 1230, the
rebellion seething in his kingdoms collapsed, town after town fell
to his victorious onslaughts, and by the end of the next month, the
disappointed Pope, who had but few sympathisers in his own country
and none in the rest of Europe, was compelled to sue for peace.</p>

<p>A treaty was signed at San Germano, a meeting took place at
Agnani, the excommunicated crusader was, perforce, received into
the reluctant bosom of the chastised Church, and the bitter old
Pope retired to brood over his supreme humiliation, while the
victorious. Emperor took up the task for which he was so eminently
fitted, the peaceful governance of a great nation.</p>

<p>Frederic, in his thirty-fifth year, four times crowned, was at
the climax of his magnificence, the triumphant ruler over wider
dominions than any other man was ever to unite under the standard
again until the age of arbitrary rulers was long past; he governed
in reality that vast realm which the later Emperors, those shadowy
Habsburg Caesars, only nominally governed in pretence, and was in
truth the Emperor of the West, a dignity claimed for centuries to
come, but, never effectively enforced nor successfully
maintained.</p>

<p>Never again was the throne of Carolus Magnus to be occupied by
anyone who filled it with such spacious dignity, never again was
the confused heritage of the Caesars to be held together by a man
of such superb genius and such grandeur of character.</p>

<p>Frederic remains not an Emperor, but the Emperor, the only
prince of a long succession of princes that was able even slightly
to justify the supreme arrogance of the claim of universal
dominion.</p>

<p>The gloomy landscapes, dark cities, sombre skies and rude
inhabitants of the North, Frederic had never loved, and he now held
his gorgeous Court in Sicily or Apulia among the soft scenes and in
the delicious climate in which he had passed his youth.</p>

<p>While he remodelled the tangled confusion of the legal system of
Southern Italy with the insight and vigour of a Justinian, founded
the University of Naples, put down the heretic and the evil-doer
with cold severity, encouraged learning, the arts and commerce with
prodigal generosity, permitted a wide tolerance to the profession
of all creeds, Frederic's genius found personal expression in the
cultivation of science, poetry, and architecture, in the formation
of a society sparkling with a brighter lustre and culture than
Europe was ever to see again till the Renaissance, in the active
delights of the chase and hawking, in the voluptuous delights of
feasts and entertainments with his poets, his dancers, his acrobats
and magicians.</p>

<p>There was no subject open to human knowledge or occurring to
human curiosity that the mighty mind of the Emperor did not invade;
no other living man could compete with him in learning; his
accomplishments, like his character, were beyond the comprehension,
if not the wonder, of his times.</p>

<p>In philosophy, mathematics, languages, medicine, and natural
science, Frederic could confound the learned men even of the
learned East, he was a soft and fluent poet, a speaker and writer
of forcible eloquence, a great builder both of dark forts and of
airy villas.</p>

<p>Exquisite palaces of marble and alabaster, mosaic and sculpture,
rose above the flowers and groves of Sicily and Apulia, grimmer
castles were erected in the disloyal North; Frederic's influence
began to change the whole aspect of the age, to bring about a
revival of law and order, of learning and the arts, of trade and
prosperity, of ease and luxury, hitherto unguessed at by his
contemporaries.</p>

<p>As he was "Lord of the Earth," so his Court was one of the
marvels of the Earth and became the nucleus of progress and the
seat of all achievements of intellect and all allurements of beauty
and grace. With his astrologers he peered into the other worlds,
with his troubadours, conjurers, and wits he relished this world,
with scholars he discussed the past, and with magicians the future;
galloping over the delicious plains of Apulia with his blindfolded
hunting cheetahs riding beside him or with his bright glittering
emperor's hawk, the golden eagle, on his delicate wrist, from one
hunting lodge to another (palaces of delicate pleasure, all of
them), seated on his pearl-strewn throne in the imperial purple,
receiving embassies or guests with noble courtesy, wandering
through his exotic menagerie, where Eastern slaves tended animals
monstrous and fantastic to the Western eye, the figure of Frederic
was ever surrounded with a blaze of admiration even greater than
his material glories.</p>

<p>His mighty power now seemed secure, and the Sicilian Caesar, in
the prime of life, with two sons to succeed him, might with
confidence believe that he had reared an empire as permanent as it
was magnificent that would continue to increase in prosperity and
enlightenment under the Hohenstaufen dynasty.</p>

<p>His spacious statesmanship had laid secure foundations for such
a future; and his measures were prudent, wise, far-seeing; he made
only one mistake; he under-estimated the influence and the hatred
of that old, old man in Rome; he believed that he had broken the
monstrous tyranny of the Popes, which had become not the rule of
Christ, but the rule of Lucifer; his own lofty and liberal mind
failed to gauge how strong was the hold of crude and stupid
superstitions on the rude peoples of the moment; surrounded by all
that was enlightened and tolerant, imbibing the placid philosophies
of the East, with a wide knowledge of the various creeds that had
in turn dominated mankind, Frederic, in the free soft airs of
Apulia, in all the brilliant freedom of his Court, could not
estimate the evil power, possessed by the Pope he had subdued but
not conciliated, or the black menace that lay in Gregory's brooding
silence.</p>

<p>From his point of view the Pontiff had cause enough for a sense
of bitter outrage; not only had the Emperor's new code summarily
disposed of many clerical privileges and pretensions, not only had
theology been replaced by the liberal sciences in the curriculum of
the University of Naples, but Frederic's whole existence was an
example of what was, in Gregory's eyes, paganism or atheism.</p>

<p>Frederic was, in fact, using all his genius, his charm, his
immense popularity and influence, in the support of free thought
and the intellectual investigation of those manifold problems that
the Church had regarded as her own exclusive province or banned as
black magic; Gregory was not wrong, as later ages were to show, in
fearing that such a liberal mind as that of the great Emperor was
fatal to the pretensions of the Papacy.</p>

<p>Nor did Frederic disguise his attitude; not only did he bestow
his favours impartially on those of all creeds, but he openly made
ironic comments on the dogmas of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>Passing through a field of ripening corn he asked, with his
satirical smile:</p>

<p>"How many gods will be made of that? How long will that mummery
last?"</p>

<p>And he had been heard to argue that if the founders of
religions, such as Jesus and Mahomet, were not impostors, their
followers made them appear so; these tales and worse were brought
to Gregory.</p>

<p>The Emperor's dearest friend and most trusted counsellor, Pietro
da Vinea, was of like mind, and those others whose advice he
sometimes sought, and to whose debates he earnestly listened, were
of that wisdom which is shackled by no formulae or creeds.</p>

<p>Frederic had built model farms, planted corn and vines on waste
places, sent merchant ships to Egypt and Syria, instructed his
people in peaceful arts, shown them an example of culture and
elegance, protected and encouraged them on the long road from chaos
to prosperity&mdash;but what was all this in the eyes of Gregory IX?</p>

<p>Frederic had founded no churches, raised no monasteries, poured
no wealth into the lap of Mother Church, there was no bigoted
priest among his counsellors, he paid but a light ironic
lip-service to the Christianity of which he was the secular
head.</p>

<p>Nor was his private life modelled on the Christian ideal; on the
score of licentiousness the Church could have had but little to
say, since this was the favourite vice of her own clergy, and if
Gregory was himself an ascetic, this was due more to a frozen
nature, a gloomy disposition and extreme old age, than to any rigid
standard of morals among the priesthood, and had Frederic been a
dutiful son of the Church, he might, like many a Christian monarch
before and after him, have indulged unreproved, nay even approved,
in any illicit or scandalous intrigue that pleased him; but his
morals received some of the wrath aroused by his atheism.</p>

<p>Frederic was not vicious; he was far too fastidious, too
cultured, too intellectual to find any attraction in coarse
indulgences of the senses; though a sumptuous provider of feasts
himself, he was sparing in his food and most temperate in his
drink, nor did his festivals and banquets ever degenerate into
orgies and displays of mere licence and profligacy; had such been
the case he could not have retained his immense hold on the minds
of men, or his own vast intellectual supremacy.</p>

<p>He kept a harem at Lucera, his Saracen city, guarded by black
eunuchs, where dwelt jealously secluded Eastern and Western
beauties, and since the death of his second Empress, he had
installed in her place a Milanese lady, Bianca da Lancia, who,
strictly enclosed in Oriental privacy and grandeur, might be
regarded as his Sultana; there was neither vice nor immorality in
this; Frederic was merely following a different and, it may be
added, a more elegant custom than that employed by other Western
potentates whose crude amours were often coarse enough.</p>

<p>Nor was there any mischief in, or arising out of, this Oriental
system about which there was neither hypocrisy nor concealment.
Frederic never interfered with the wives and daughters or
mistresses of his subjects (such a common cause of disorder and
tragedy in mediaeval Europe), nor did he bring his name into the
odium and disgrace of any scandalous or devastating passion; he
preserved always the strength and dignity of a man never influenced
by women, though he set the example of an exceeding courtesy
towards them, and many of his laws were in their favour.</p>

<p>For the rest it may be doubted whether feminine seductions
occupied more of Frederic's attention than that of any other prince
-of southern temperament. Eastern training and unlimited
opportunity for self-indulgence, and the exaggerated tales of his
extreme licentiousness, which have been so dwelt on, really prove
nothing but the distorted spite of his enemies.</p>

<p>Frederic saw no reason why he should follow the Christian ideal,
which Christians themselves found far too difficult to achieve,
and, in choosing the customs of the East, could hardly suppose he
was affronting the purity of a Church whose corruptions were so
manifest and whose licence was so universal.</p>

<p>Frederic must have heard the denunciations by the clergy of his
charming odalisques with more than his usual amused irony; the man
who had abolished serfdom and been the first monarch to summon the
third estate to his councils must have laughed indeed at the fierce
importance given to his private relaxations, which were adorned
with all that was lovely and delicate.</p>

<p>It is said that St. Francis of Assisi visited the languorous
Sicilian Court of Frederic; a strange meeting this, between the man
who was the literal follower of Jesus of Nazareth and the man who
opposed the monstrous worldly power usurped in that gentle
name.</p>

<p>They must have gazed at each other with a deep curiosity, the
dirty, sickly, ragged monk, the perfumed, exquisite, and voluptuous
Emperor, made delightful with every worldly device, charming with
every grace of mind and body.</p>

<p>It is interesting to wonder if the omnipotent prince saw in his
wretched guest that mystic and holy light which was to make the
name of Francis of Assisi reverenced by multitudes when that of
Frederic Hohenstaufen would be forgotten save by the learned.</p>

<p>It is certain that he listened with courtesy to the sweet
doctrines of the mendicant monk, which were as far in advance of
the times as his own wide tolerance, and which were not so
different from those he was familiar with from the withered lips of
Eastern anchorites.</p>

<p>Renunciation, abnegation, poverty and self-sacrifice, these
virtues were impossible to the rich character, the active powerful
mind of the Emperor, but he could respect their pale glory; there
is little doubt but that the cult of St. Francis would have
flourished unchecked in the Empire this tolerant king hoped to
found. When he watched the miserable monk, whose haggard face was
transfigured by divine tenderness, cross his alabaster halls and
descend his gilded steps, pass his scarlet-clad Ethiopians and
disappear under the plumy trees of his delicious gardens, Frederic
must have felt as another ruler felt when faced with another such
figure&mdash;"What is truth?"</p>

<p>The first hint of the dark doom that was to overwhelm for ever
the brilliant promise of the Hohenstaufen empire came from within
Frederic's own family; his son Henry, installed as regent of
Germany, joined the Lombard League in a rebellion against the
imperial authority, which the Emperor had little difficulty in
crushing; the feeble, ungrateful and profligate Henry, once
pardoned in vain, was at last shut up a prisoner in one of the
Apulian castles.</p>

<p>When this disorder was effectually suppressed, Frederic, then in
Germany, married, for the third time, Isabella, sister of Henry III
of England; the beautiful Angevin princess delighted the fine taste
of Frederic; she was much beneath him, England being, technically,
a mere fief of the Empire.</p>

<p>Frederic followed the gorgeous ceremonial of his marriage with a
resplendent Diet at Mainz, where even the son of the Guelf emperor,
Otto of Brunswick, a cousin of the Empress, swore submission to the
Hohenstaufen.</p>

<p>This Diet was the most impressive manifestation of his glory
Frederic had yet made; never again was any emperor to appear in
such a dazzle of pomp, with such a blazing reputation, as the
acknowledged head of so many nations.</p>

<p>This glittering display of armed might and far-reaching power
also contained the germ of that struggle which was to bring all the
grandeur of the Hohenstaufen to the bloodstained dust.</p>

<p>Frederic resolved to chastise the miscreant and disloyal Duke of
Austria and to punish the sullen disaffection of the great cities
of Northern Italy.</p>

<p>At first the punitive expedition that Frederic led against the
Guelf had a flashing success, which further increased his almost
incredible fame and power; the great battle of Cortenuova was a
carnage of his enemies; he rode like a Caesar indeed&mdash;into Cremona,
followed by his monstrous elephant dragging the <i>carroccio,</i>
the cherished symbol of Milan, on which the captured <i>podesta</i>
was bound like a slave.</p>

<p>At Lodi he gathered together vassals and allies from all corners
of the earth; there were reinforcements from Sultan Kamel, from
Vataces, Emperor of the East, from France, Spain, and Henry of
England, whose sister the Empress was now the mother of Frederic's
third son, the second Henry.</p>

<p>All the coffers of the world seemed open to pour their treasures
at the feet of Frederic, all the men-at-arms of East and West were
eager to do homage to the lord of the world and to serve under the
conquering eagles, there was no limit to Frederic's glory and
might. Nor any limit to his revenge.</p>

<p>Milan sued for peace in vain, uselessly made the most
humiliating concessions; Frederic was not to be deprived of his
vengeance against this ancient gadfly of his House; he had shown
himself clement and just in peace, but in war terrible with the
cold, ferocious cruelty of the Hohenstaufen; Eccelin da Romano, a
man spoken of, even in those fierce days, as an incarnation of the
Devil, was his trusted lieutenant, and he never checked the
atrocities of his Saracen soldiers nor restrained the savagery of
his Eastern allies.</p>

<p>Horror and darkness reigned in Lombardy, in Milan Cathedral the
derided crucifix was hung upside down by a people driven to an
outburst of despair.</p>

<p>The coming of the terrific Emperor with his hideous negroes, his
grotesque beasts, his Eastern magi, his troops of jewel-hung
wantons, his escorts of blood-drenched warriors, had been like the
opening of Hell's mouth belching forth demons on the lovely plains
of Lombardy.</p>

<p>The figure of Frederic Hohenstaufen himself, implacable,
charming, superb, with his amazing learning, his Oriental customs,
his ruthless cruelty, his swift movements from town to town, his
notorious atheism, seemed to the excited minds of the despairing
rebels that of Lucifer, the fallen angel, more potent for evil than
God was for good.</p>

<p>And many saw in the elegant knight clad in the light armour,
with the imposing imperial crown encircling the peacock-plumed
helmet that rested on the reddish hair, in the shaven face with the
small nose and full lips, in the pale bright ironic eyes, the
dreadful personification of Antichrist.</p>

<p>Five desperate cities still held out against the imperial wrath;
Frederic had made the first definite mistake of his career, driving
a defeated foe to despair; Lombardy, having nothing to hope from
her own concessions or the clemency of the Hohenstaufen, proceeded
to defend herself with the fury of desperation that is so often
successful.</p>

<p>Frederic and all his dreadful panoply of war was unable to take
Brescia; after a two months' bloody struggle he was obliged to
raise the siege.</p>

<p>A conqueror's first check is dangerous to his fame; Lombardy saw
that the Emperor was not invincible and redoubled her frantic and
ferocious resistance; and while the Guelfs were rallying in this
brief breathing space, Frederic made another error, even more fatal
than his injudicious vengeance against the Lombards.</p>

<p>He married his natural son, the beautiful Enzio of the long gold
locks, to Adelasia, widow of the king of Sardinia, and haughtily
claimed the island, then a papal fief, as lost territory of the
Empire.</p>

<p>This was a definite challenge to the Pope, one that Gregory was
quick to seize and that Frederic would have been wise not to make.
The long-contained, bitter hate of the old man in Rome had at last
found occasion to break forth in hissing rage.</p>

<p>There was something gigantic and grand in the wrath with which
the aged Pontiff, then nearly a hundred years old, met the
arrogance of the loathed prince, and once again hurled anathema
against his mighty rival for universal power.</p>

<p>On Palm Sunday, 1239, Frederic Hohenstaufen was again
excommunicated with all the dramatic ritual of the outraged
Church.</p>

<p>The Emperor, holding sumptuous Court at Pavia, received the news
with sardonic indifference; Europe was distracted by the various
cartels and manifestos issued first by the Pope and then by the
Emperor, in which each stated his case with glowing eloquence and
selection's from the lurid denunciations of the Apocalypse;
Frederic's main accusation against Gregory was that of avarice;
that of Gregory against Frederic, of atheism.</p>

<p>In this warfare of polemics Frederic might have been considered
the victor; the princes of Europe were not to be against him. Louis
IX declared himself his partisan, and England, when further
squeezed to provide funds for the papal coffers, declared roundly:
"the greedy avarice of Rome has exhausted the English Church ";
Germany was whole-heartedly for Frederic, the Archbishop of
Salzburg plainly named Gregory Antichrist and it seemed as if the
fulminations of the Pope would recoil on himself.</p>

<p>Doubtless at the moment Frederic fancied that he would be able
to achieve the mighty purpose unfolded in his final proclamation to
his princes:</p>

<p>"I am no enemy of the Priesthood; I honour the humblest priest
as a father, if he will keep out of secular affairs. The Pope cries
out that I would root out Christianity with force and by the sword.
Folly!&mdash;as if the Kingdom of God could be rooted out by force and
the sword; it is by evil lusts, by avarice and rapacity, that it is
weakened, polluted, corrupted...I will give back to the sheep their
shepherd, to the people their bishop, to the world its spiritual
father, I will tear the mask from the face of this wolfish tyrant,
and force him to lay aside worldly affairs and earthly pomp and
tread in the Holy footsteps of Christ."</p>

<p>The mighty old Pope was an adversary worthy of Frederic; he
declared a holy war against the Emperor and gave the Guelf faction
in Lombardy the immense stimulus of his support; the enemies of the
Hohenstaufen were permitted to consider themselves crusaders and to
wear the cross on their arms; Papal Legates everywhere animated the
rebels, and Frederic's next campaign against Milan proved abortive;
he could not take the great city, which shortly before had offered
in vain to burn her banners at his feet.</p>

<p>His son Enzio, had, however, made a victorious progress in the
March, and Frederic, turning towards the papal dominions, entered
the open gates of city after city which pulled down the standard of
the Keys to raise that of the eagles.</p>

<p>In the very streets of crowded Rome the volatile people shouted
for Frederic the conqueror, and the Pope was in danger of being
sacrificed on his own altars.</p>

<p>But the indomitable old man saved himself and his cause by an
action of flamboyant courage; unarmed, in full glitter of holy
vestments, surrounded by the sweet faces of little acolytes and the
shrunken visages of ancient priests, Gregory IX tottered forth from
the Lateran and proceeded on foot through the narrow streets of
Rome close-packed with a hostile populace yelling for Frederic
Hohenstaufen, the bright and mighty Caesar, the smiling and superb
conqueror.</p>

<p>Before him were borne aloft the most sacred relics of the Holy
City, the heads of St. Peter and St. Paul and a fragment of the
true Cross.</p>

<p>The feeble old man staked everything on this magnificent gesture
and won.</p>

<p>Rome, in a revulsion of feeling, was soon cringing at his feet,
and Frederic lost all chance of a welcome in the Holy City.</p>

<p>A desultory warfare, confused and bitter, marked by treachery,
cruelty and rapine on either side, now dragged on; Frederic showed
a noble clemency to the heroic little garrisons of Faenza and
Benevento, which stands out among the atrocious episodes of this
ghastly' struggle as worthy of record: Frederic was not often
merciful.</p>

<p>In the midst of this unnatural war between the two heads of
Christendom, Europe shuddered to hear that one and a half millions
of ferocious Tartars were hurling themselves into Hungary, sweeping
the Magyars before them; Gregory did not hesitate to accuse
Frederic of inviting the pagan hordes to devastate Europe.</p>

<p>The Emperor scorned to reply to this crazy malice and sent his
sons, Enzio and Conrad, against the "opposing Devils" as he called
them, and issued one of his grandiose summonses "to every noble and
renowned country lying under the Star of the West" to help defeat
the barbarians whom "Satan himself has lured hither to die before
the Victorious Eagles of Imperial Europe."</p>

<p>The response to his eloquent appeal was poor, and it was left to
the chivalry of Germany to turn back the tide of Tartar invasion
into the unknown regions of Asia whence it came.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the inexorable Pope, defeated on every hand, summoned
a General Council of the Christian hierarchy with the avowed object
of deposing Frederic.</p>

<p>The Emperor not only refused to submit to such a tribunal, but
his allies, the Pisans, captured the Genoese fleet that was bearing
the bulk of the prelates to the conclave; these priests, by Enzio's
orders, were chained and cast into miserable prisons where, in
wretchedness and disease, they had dismal leisure to repent their
folly in obeying the papal mandate.</p>

<p>Frederic now advanced on Rome and captured the town of
Monteforte; this last loss was too much even for the iron-hearted
Pope, still breathing fury against his enemy, for his implacable
spirit and his exhausted body in the hot summer of 1242; he had
been dauntless to the last and shown a blaze of courage that would
have been wholly admirable if it had not been inspired by a blaze
of hate.</p>

<p>"He is dead," said Frederic serenely, "through whom Peace was
banished from the Earth and Discord prospered."</p>

<p>But he had left heirs.</p>

<p>For two years Christendom was without a Pope, the internecine
war flickered in Lombardy and Frederic retired to lovely Foggio,
there to enjoy some of that sumptuous leisure in which he
delighted, and of which he had known little of late.</p>

<p>Here his third Empress, Isabella of the "excelling beauty,"
died, and here he heard that his eldest son, Henry, had dashed his
brains out in despair at the rigours of his Apulian prison.</p>

<p>"We are not the first nor shall we be the last," said Frederic
with his smiling irony, now more hard and bitter, "to mourn an
ungrateful son."</p>

<p>In June, 1243, Cardinal Sinibaldo Fiescho, of the great Genoese
family, was elected Pope under the name of Innocent IV.</p>

<p>The new Pope, quarrelsome, avaricious, arrogant, and malicious
to a superlative degree, had no virtue unless the courage with
which he maintained his odious pretensions be considered one.</p>

<p>His reign began with the exchange of cold courtesies between
himself and the wary Frederic, but causes for disagreement
immediately arose; at the instigation of the priests the imperial
garrison of Viterbo was murdered by the populace. Frederic hanged
two mendicant friars (the Franciscans and Dominicans were papal
agents and spies, and perpetually employed in fomenting
disturbances among the lower classes) and the long negotiations
that followed were both irritating and futile.</p>

<p>Frederic wished for peace in which to attend to his own affairs,
but Innocent did not desire any means of concord, he beguiled and
deceived the Emperor in every way, and followed his predecessor's
policy of rousing Europe against Frederic and extorting money from
abroad to carry on his campaign against the imperial power.</p>

<p>"May the Devil fly away with you!" cried the harassed Henry of
England to one of the Legates who came demanding money for Rome,
and the angry barons hustled the unpopular priest out of England;
for all that Innocent did extort vast sums from that country,
almost to the point of draining dry what he called "our garden of
delights, our inexhaustible well."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Frederic harried Lombardy and the Pope pronounced
another of those anathemas that had lost effect through too
frequent repetition.</p>

<p>The next step was the Council of Lyons held in 1245, where
Innocent by his own mouth, and Frederic by that of Thaddeus of
Seussa, charged and counter-charged each other with a long list of
crimes.</p>

<p>In the end, Innocent, dashing a lighted torch on the ground,
formally deposed Frederic from his throne, crying in the gathering
gloom of the convent, as the Cardinals' torches followed his into
darkness:</p>

<p>"So be the glory and fortune of the Emperor extinguished upon
earth!"</p>

<p>Frederic was at Turin when the news of this terrific malediction
was brought to him; he rose from amidst his superb company and
commanded his treasure chest to be brought to him.</p>

<p>When it was opened before him he took out the imperial crown and
placed it himself on his head, crowning himself as he had crowned
himself before in Jerusalem, in the Pope's despite.</p>

<p>"The Pope has deprived me of my crown. Not one of my crowns but
is here."</p>

<p>And then he added those words that are surely as superbly
arrogant as any ever uttered by man, the utmost challenge of human
pride to human pride:</p>

<p>"I hold my Crown of God alone, and neither the Pope nor the
Devil, nor the Council, shall rend it from me. Does he, in his
vulgar pride, think that he shall hurl me from the Imperial
dignity; me, who am the Chief Prince of all the World, yea, who am
without an equal?</p>

<p>"I am now released from all respect; I am set free from all ties
of love and peace; no longer need I keep any measure with this
man."</p>

<p>So spoke Frederic&mdash;"of God alone"; but who was Frederic's
God?</p>

<p>He knew now that between himself and Innocent it was a fight for
life, a struggle so fierce and ruthless that everything would be
lost sight of but the lust of the death grips; every evil force,
every vile passion, every cruelty, all manner of lies and
treacheries, every aspect of hate was let loose, like a team of
hellish monsters, on Frederic and his dominions.</p>

<p>Only some humiliation like the humiliation of Henry at Canossa
might have placated the Pope, and such a humiliation it was not in
Frederic's nature to make.</p>

<p>He sent envoys to every Court of his fellow kings, stating his
case, as did Innocent; the Pope's denunciations were of ghastly
fury. Frederic was a beast, a viper, his forehead was of brass, his
portion was Hell, he and his progeny were relegated to eternal
damnation.</p>

<p>No foreign prince was roused to interfere in the atrocious
struggle convulsing Central Europe and Italy; every one shuddered
away from the horror of the conflict between two such terrific and
mighty powers.</p>

<p>While Frederic was grimly fighting in Lombardy, Innocent hatched
a conspiracy against his life, which the Emperor discovered,
punishing the culprits with hideous severity.</p>

<p>Innocent then cast about to find an emperor to put in the place
of the deposed Hohenstaufen; he set up Henry of Thuringia, and,
after his immediate death, William of Holland, an ambitious
stripling, who was crowned in Aix-la-Chapelle thirty-two years
after Frederic had received there the crown of Carolus Magnus.</p>

<p>Frederic's son, Conrad, began to fall back in Germany, and amid
the appalling confusion of Italy the eagles were beginning to
falter and sink behind the myriad standards of the rebels.</p>

<p>A deep melancholy settled on Frederic as he hurled himself from
city to city, from castle to castle; his task had become
overwhelming, and he was no longer young.</p>

<p>At fifty years of age he had to face a titanic upheaval of his
entire life work, to combat a ring of enemies so close and
inexorable that he did not know where to strike first; every day
brought news of some fresh defection, some new revolt, some more
bitter insult from Pope or friar, some falling off of a faint
friend, some pouncing of a malicious foe; he was stripped of all
his intellectual pursuits in which he so delighted, his delicious
repose, his beautiful courtly pleasures; no more for him the
building of alabaster palaces by azure seas, the discussion of
abstruse problems with silk-clad sages on marble terraces, the
writing of love sonnets or books on hawking, no more experiments
with the mysteries of this world and other worlds, no more
sumptuous festivals, flower adorned, scented with cassia and myrrh,
sweet with the songs of troubadours and warm southern twilights;
useless now magicians and wise men and troops of dancing-girls and
gauze-shrouded odalisques behind gilded lattices, no time for this,
for any of this, all that remained was war, replete with every
circumstance of horror; everywhere were strife and desolation, the
uprooting of beauty and peace and ease by bloody hands, the
destruction of progress and art and commerce by spear and sword and
fire; where Frederic had set fair kingdoms, which had been the
example of the world, were now anarchy and plague and all
abomination.</p>

<p>And at Lyons sat the monstrous Pope, glutted with blood, gorged
with hate, satiated with gold, ringed round with superstitious
terrors, drawing in treasure from all corners of the earth for this
most dreadful war, finding allies in every evil passion known to
man.</p>

<p>In face of this, the mightiest accumulation of forces ever
ranged against a single human being, Frederic maintained his lofty
pride, often scowling and bitter now, but never downcast or
submissive; he never considered surrender or cessation of the
struggle, and he exerted every nerve to continue the unequal fight,
the end of which he by now had foreseen.</p>

<p>Not only did there stare in his face the prospect of incessant
and ruthless strife for the rest of his days, but the prospect of
the ruin of the House of Hohenstaufen, which he had hoped would
lead the world through countless ages.</p>

<p>Looking round him on the seething ruin of anarchy to which his
kingdoms were reduced, Frederic must have foreseen the extinction,
not only of his power, but of his family, and tasted in
anticipation the agony of that day in Naples when his grandson, the
young Conradin, would pay on the scaffold the tribute of the last
drop of Hohenstaufen blood to Hohenstaufen pride.</p>

<p>Yet, even with his eyes turned towards the gathering doom,
Frederic maintained stoic fortitude; there remained close by his
side some friends of his youth, Thaddeus of Seussa, Pietro da Vinea
and a woman, Bianca da Lancia, mother of the gallant Manfred; in
the wane of her beauty and his fortune Frederic had married her, a
tribute to her long affection, and perhaps an expression of a love
outlasting passion on his part; the marriage of the deposed,
excommunicated Hohenstaufen was only partially recognised, but was
both a dignity and a solace to the faithful woman and her noble
son.</p>

<p>In May, 1247, Frederic, gathering all his power together, hurled
himself across the Alps with something of the superb daring of his
youth, and advanced on Lyons where his loathsome enemy was
ensconced; Innocent screamed to France for succour, and Louis IX,
who, for all his saintliness, was a childish slave of gross
superstition, saw in the dreadful Pope only the representative of
God on earth, and offered the whole chivalry of France against
Frederic.</p>

<p>This did not deter the Emperor from proceeding on his grim march
to Lyons; but he was forced to abandon this bold and magnificent
enterprise by the news of the fall of Parma, taken by the papal
forces through treachery and guile.</p>

<p>Whipped to fury, the Emperor hastened back over the Alps and
threw his still resplendent armies round Parma, a city in every way
important to the imperial cause.</p>

<p>With him were his two sons, King Enzio, and Conrad and Eccelin
da Romano, his dreadful lieutenant. By the end of the year Parma
was so completely and artfully surrounded that relief seemed
hopeless.</p>

<p>Frederic had also erected, for himself and his troops, a castle
and city outside Parma, which he called Vittoria, in haughty
anticipation of his coming triumph, which was to be he thought
another Cortenuova.</p>

<p>So sure appeared the fall of the beleaguered city that the
imperial troops became careless, and, on a February morning in
1248, Frederic left Vittoria for a hunting expedition on the plains
of Lombardy, then temptingly sweet with the first airs of
spring.</p>

<p>Immediately there was a sally from the south gate of Parma,
which attracted the attention of the Imperialists; this was a
feint; the Parmese made a magnificent and desperate onslaught on
Vittoria, inspired by the despair born of famine and the prospect
of the unspeakable fate awaiting them when the town fell.</p>

<p>Frederic, galloping over the lovely plains in the chase, chanced
to turn in the saddle and behold the horizon flaming red.</p>

<p>With horror in his heart the Emperor dashed back towards
Vittoria; when he reached the imperial fortress nothing was left of
it but a roaring furnace and crashing towers; the Parmese, pouring
out of the beleaguered city, had utterly overwhelmed the Emperor's
troops, Thaddeus of Seussa had been torn to pieces, the very seals,
sceptre, and crown of Frederic had been seized, the imperial diadem
worn by a deformed dwarf in the lunatic and ribald triumph of the
Parmese, the frantic exultations of the Guelfs.</p>

<p>Frederic was unable to force his way through the stream of
fugitives; he and his personal retinue were swept back along the
Cremona road by the flying hordes of his own defeated soldiery;
dishevelled, exhausted, helpless, the Emperor was hustled in the
press.</p>

<p>The defeat was complete, the rout shameful, the humiliation
bitter beyond all bitterness; Frederic entered Cremona amid the
rabble of his overthrown armies and the insults of the population;
never had his fortunes seemed so dark, never had he been so
personally lowered in the eyes of mankind.</p>

<p>His friend, Thaddeus of Seussa, had died hideously in the
disgraceful medley; the Emperor had not too many friends.</p>

<p>Frederic rallied from this crushing blow with an energy of pride
and a swiftness of fury that compelled the awestruck admiration of
his enemies; he who had so long defied the maledictions of Rome,
and defended himself so skilfully against all the linked powers of
this world and the next, began to be regarded as something more
than human, either God or devil.</p>

<p>While some saw in the invincible Hohenstaufen a Messiah sent to
overthrow the Antichrist of Rome, others beheld in him one of the
monstrous beasts of Revelation, come to reign in terror and horror
upon earth; Frederic, again encamped on the smoking ruins of
Vittoria, smiled bitterly beneath scowling brows at both aspects of
his blazing fame and still presented his undiminished arrogance to
his manifold foes.</p>

<p>Louis IX, on his way to the crusades, interceded with the fell
old Pope for Frederic, and begged that the ban might be removed
from the Emperor and he be allowed to join the French chivalry in
the expedition to Palestine; but the plea of the saintly knight was
made in vain; Innocent replied by cursing all the descendants,
friends, and supporters of the "Great Dragon" to endless
generations.</p>

<p>And now a blow was struck at the dauntless Caesar that seemed
like a curse indeed; the story is obscure, but this much emerges
from the half-legendary tales, that Pietro da Vinea, the Emperor's
dearest friend, raised by him from obscurity was induced, by who
knows what foul and secret ways, to attempt his master's life by
poisoning the very cup he handed him in amity.</p>

<p>Frederic had with utmost bitterness discovered the plot, and
Pietro da Vinea and his accomplices&mdash;all instruments of
Innocent&mdash;were punished in circumstances of incredible horror.</p>

<p>The Emperor showed more emotion over this treachery than he had
ever been seen to display before, the clear ironic eyes were at
last dimmed with tears, the superb head bent in unappeasable woe;
and his grief was swiftly followed by one yet more agonising, his
beloved son, King Enzio, the beautiful, accomplished darling of his
heart, was captured by the papal forces and held prisoner in
Bologna, the Pope's own city.</p>

<p>Frederic frantically offered to fill the city's moats with gold,
but all ransom was refused; for twenty-three years Enzio was to
groan in captivity until, long after his father's death, his own
came to quench his withering hopes.</p>

<p>First Parma and the death of Thaddeus, then, Pietro da Vinea's
Judas act, then, the capture of his most beloved son; the heart of
Frederic shrunk in his breast, a slow languor crept over his limbs,
grey, like handfuls of ashes, showed in the Hohenstaufen red of his
locks, his shaven cheek was haggard, his hawk-like eye dim, some
malady seemed to be consuming him, he had to endure hours of pain,
nights of wakefulness, days of weakness, the intense pain of lonely
desolation.</p>

<p>He kept a cold, scornful face to his enemies&mdash;he launched out on
them with ruthless cruelty, blood and fire, rapine and torment,
were his weapons also; every terror the mind of man could devise he
sent out against the swarming friars and papal mercenaries, the
rebels and the traitors, who stalked his lands, and with such
ferocious grandeur did he maintain his cause that Europe veered to
his side in the monstrous quarrel, and the power and prestige of
Innocent began to decline, even with the strength of the
Emperor.</p>

<p>Frederic had aided King Louis in Palestine even in the midst of
his own disasters, while the Pope spent the money scraped together
by Christendom for the crusades, in his frantic campaigns against
Frederic, therefore when the French were miserably defeated in
Egypt the blame fell, justly enough, on the violent and implacable
Pope; the two brothers of Louis IX came from Acre and menaced
Innocent with the whole might of France if he did not make peace
with Frederic.</p>

<p>The Emperor had been victorious in Lombardy; Germany and Sicily
stood firm to his cause; in France he had a new ally; England was
warmer towards him than towards Innocent, whose bloodthirsty
hostility had alienated most nations. It seemed as if, even yet,
the Hohenstaufen might again climb to that haughty height from
which the shadow of his sceptre would lie across the world.</p>

<p>But the tremendous fight was over; the Emperor was a dying
man.</p>

<p>Every day he felt his strength slipping from him, every day he
felt deeper indifference to material things, every day he brooded
more hopelessly over Pietro, Thaddeus, Enzio, and the destruction
of the life's work.</p>

<p>The virulent hate of arrogant old men had destroyed the fruits
of his genius, rendered his great gifts useless, reduced to a
wilderness of confusion and misery and discord those dominions he
had so fondly cherished and so wisely governed.</p>

<p>Flung aside and trampled down were all his plans for progress,
for enlightenment, for culture and civilisation, for a universal
tolerance and peace.</p>

<p>Nothing remained; the insane furies of the Popes had set Europe
back for hundreds of years, and all Frederic's works were to be but
tales of wonder.</p>

<p>But the Emperor did not falter in his pride or bend from his
purpose. From the darkness and chaos gathering round him came his
serene challenge:</p>

<p>"Before this generation and the generation to come, I will have
the glory of resisting the papal tyranny."</p>

<p>Travelling to Lucera, his Saracen city, where was his lovely
palace, the dear scene of his hours of solace, the fainting Emperor
called a halt in which to die.</p>

<p>The imperial train stopped at Fiorentino; it was December, the
one sharp month of Sicilian winter, and the clouds hung dark over
Etna and over the sea as the Emperor was carried by his Saracen
soldiers to his death chamber.</p>

<p>He made his will, leaving the Empire of the world to his sons in
turn, Conrad, Henry, Manfred. This last, the noble knight, the
elegant scholar, the wise statesman, Bianca da Lancia's son, was
with him now, heavy with grief and the presentiment of doom. And
with him also was Berard, the Archbishop of Palermo, who had been
with him thirty-eight years before in the triumph of that first
daring crossing of the Alps in all the surpassing pride of
youth.</p>

<p>The languor of death evoked no complaint from Frederic
Hohenstaufen, he displayed none of the grovelling terrors the
excommunicate Emperor, Otto of Brunswick, showed in his last
moments, but he acceded to the prayer of the old priest, who had
been so loyal to him, and received from these ancient, faithful
lips the absolution of the Church that had hounded him to
death.</p>

<p>For the last time the ironic light flashed in the grey eyes, the
ironic smile on the sensual mouth, and Frederic, pressing the hand
of the weeping Manfred, turned his calm face to the wall, and, on a
brief sigh, died.</p>

<p>It was December 13th, 1250, less than a fortnight from the
anniversary of his birth; he had lived his grand, terrible, and
beautiful life for nearly fifty-six years of unsurpassable
splendour, and was buried in what had been his earliest robe, the
dark imperial purple, fitting symbol of his inviolate and justified
pride.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANCE OF THE REVOLUTION&mdash;TWO OPINIONS</h3>

<p class="first">
IT is always difficult and dangerous to describe isolated
episodes of history; difficult, because every event, however neatly
labelled, must be the result of causes that are involved,
far-reaching, and obscure; and dangerous, because, to consider one
episode as if it were detached from all the other episodes that
have built up the story of a nation, is misleading in that it gives
a false perspective. There are, however, some great events of
history that have been so persistently dramatised, sentimentalised,
used to strengthen party propaganda or to fan religious zeal, that,
heavily enriched by tradition and the inventions of the poet and
the novelist, they remain familiar by name even to those who care
nothing for the forces that went to produce them and know nothing
of the men who were their chief actors.</p>

<p>One of the most conspicuous of these episodes in English history
is the Revolution of 1688, which was not only outwardly exciting,
dramatic, and romantic, calculated to remain long in the memory of
men, but also of considerable political importance, both to this
island and to Europe. The same cannot be claimed for other events
dear to the popular imagination&mdash;for instance, the over-written
revolts of 1715 and 1745 were of no political significance
whatever, and the story of England would have been unaltered if the
Duke of Monmouth, to whom so many enthusiastic books have been
devoted, had never been born.</p>

<p>But the upheaval of 1688 did introduce changes not only in our
constitution, but even in our mode of thought and in our habit of
life, the effects of which are still felt to-day. National pride is
fond of the phrase "the age of Anne," but most of the achievements
usually credited to the brief reign of that amiable nonentity had
at least their foundation in the years 1688-1702.</p>

<p>The Duke of Marlborough, ruler of the camp and Cabinet, and his
wife, ruler of the closet, carried out the foreign policy of
William III of Orange and the domestic ideal of Mary II. These two
people and those they encouraged left a very definite impress both
on England's position abroad and on her behaviour at home, none the
less strong because it is often ignored. Moreover, as far as this
is ever possible in relating history, it is possible to draw a line
of demarcation between the reign of James II and those of his
successors, and to treat the revolution of 1688 as both a momentous
and a separate event. It is not, however, very easy to do this
without devoting more space to considering the conditions and
characters that produced the abrupt end of the male Stewart dynasty
than can be spared in a brief essay.</p>

<p>Until recently, the almost unchallenged view held by historians
and laymen alike was that the Revolution of 1688 was as Edmund
Burke proclaimed, "great and glorious." It was represented, very
simply, as a heroic effort on the part of noble-minded patriots to
resist the crimes and errors of a besotted tyrant, and as the final
adjustment of that English Constitution which was so near
perfection as to serve as a model for the world. Many Whig
historians give the impression, perhaps unconsciously, that this
Revolution, proudly proclaimed as "bloodless," resulted in the
formation of a model state that expanded smoothly along lines of
progress until it culminated in the bland triumphs of Victoria,
beyond which human felicity, in the opinion of these enthusiasts,
could scarcely advance.</p>

<p>Children's lesson books of the middle and latter part of last
century gravely enjoined on the little readers the duty of thanking
God for the privileges they enjoyed as free-born English boys and
girls, who inherited their comfort and liberty from those
ancestors, who, with divine help, made an end of "brass money,
wooden shoes, the Pope, and the King of France in 1688." This naive
point of view was, no doubt, sincere, and contained some truth, but
it should be remembered that the ruling dynasty and the dominant
classes were the direct result of 1688 and that these powerful
influences did all they could to extol the event that had given
them eminence and wealth. Chairs of History at the Universities
were founded with the sole object of enforcing the Whig side of the
question, and the scholars who occupied these posts made it as
difficult to realise the Roman Catholic and Stewart ideals and aims
as it was to gain an understanding of the Plantagenets under the
rule of the Tudors.</p>

<p>The losing side was, as usual, not only beaten, but silenced and
misrepresented, and the winning side garnished with all possible
virtues by those who enjoyed the fruits of the failure of the
former and the success of the latter. Not that there was often much
tendency to praise William of Orange; with the notable exceptions
of Hallam, Macaulay, and Seeley, the foreign prince was dismissed
with lukewarm admiration&mdash;his chief fault being that he was not an
Englishman. But it was for the native patriots, the men who were
the spiritual heirs of the Hampdens, the Vanes, the Sidneys, the
Russells, that the highest encomiums were reserved. Whig and
Protestant writers found glowing themes for their pens in their
description of how the liberties of England were preserved through
the noble action of the bishops, the single-minded endeavours of
self-sacrificing statesmen, and the just indignation and courageous
resistance of the people. To them it was a plain and impressive
story, James II was a fool, a tyrant, a bigot; he attempted,
clumsily, illegally, and with gross cruelty, to interfere with the
liberties of England, so dearly if somewhat vaguely cherished in
the breast of every Englishman since Magna Carta (in the opinion of
the nineteenth century falsely important), and he endeavoured to
overturn the Anglican Church, the country's considered choice of
Faith, in favour of Roman Catholicism, forever associated in the
mind of the people with the fires of the Marian persecutions, and
to introduce into the heart of native politics those Jesuits
considered hatefully typical of deceit, treachery, idolatry, and
darkly mysterious intrigue.</p>

<p>From these dangers, which nearly overwhelmed the independence of
England and almost destroyed the properties and gravely imperilled
the lives of her inhabitants, the country was saved by the pure
patriotism and unselfish zeal of her Protestant leaders, backed by
the courage and common sense of the people. These saviours of their
country invited the assistance of a Prince, the champion of
Protestantism, who also satisfied the English sense of law and
order by being the husband of the heiress to the Crown and himself
the nearest Prince of the Blood. The historians of this school were
able, with justifiable complacency, to relate the complete success
of this daring move, the ignoble flight of the rejected King, and
the triumphant installation of the nation's choice as the first
constitutional monarch, together with the restoration of the
religion, the rights and privileges, so terribly endangered and so
valiantly rescued.</p>

<p>The story, which was not without its epic outline, then went on
to describe the arduous war that resulted as the French King's
championship of the Stewarts, the domestic troubles that could not,
however, shake the steadfast national spirit, the final disposal of
the discrowned tyrant as a glorious victory which had a second
merit, that of once more teaching Ireland her place, the
magnificent defeat of Louis XIV's naval power, together with such
civilised benefits as a milled coinage, the Bank of England,
consols, toleration for the Nonconformists, Bible Societies, decent
public behaviour for gentlewomen, and the coming into fashion of
those virtues hitherto considered dull and dowdy.</p>

<p>Having thus disposed of the Great Deliverer (not without some
regret for his foreign friends and dry manners&mdash;it was felt that he
hardly valued highly enough the honour done him by England) and the
Glorious Revolution, the Whig historian proceeded, with an obvious
sense of satisfaction, to the gratifying successes and undeniable
splendours of the Augustan Age, which were genuine home products.
Even about "Brandy-faced Nan," the pious Whig chronicler was ready
to murmur: "A poor thing, but mine own."</p>

<p>So in these succinct, straightforward accounts of 1688 and its
results, national pride, the popular point of view, the political
convictions of the majority, tradition and loyalty to the House of
Hanover, were alike served.</p>

<p>The day came when these motives no longer swayed the historian
and when a powerful section of opinion, long-suppressed or ignored,
found a voice. We then were shown the reverse of the medal and
discovered that there was a very good defence available for what
had seemed indefensible, and a very keen difference of opinion
where no such difference had seemed possible.</p>

<p>Roman Catholics, passionate advocates of that old cult known as
the "Romaunt" of the Stewarts, more or less impartial workers who
were tired of the old pompous formulae and the old, threadbare
catchwords, lively, inquisitive writers, eager to reverse
established, historical judgments for the mere love of the
paradoxical and the new, gave us very different pictures of an
event that had been almost sacrosanct in the opinion of our
ancestors. James II, we then learned, was not only far from being a
tyrant and a bigot, he was a man with the interests of his country
passionately at heart and sincerely anxious for religious
toleration. Foully betrayed by the machinations of men who could
not appreciate his lofty idealism, and undermined by the sly
intrigues of his ambitious son-in-law, the unfortunate monarch lost
his throne, purely through the crimes of others and his fidelity to
a hereditary Faith. Some writers even portrayed James II as a saint
and a martyr, one too involved in an ecstasy of mysticism to be
able to deal with the craft of lesser men, and they pointed to the
sackcloth and ashes of his end in triumphant vindication of their
contention.</p>

<p>There is much material with which to strengthen this view of the
dethroned monarch&mdash;the facts that one daughter took his crown and
another forsook him, the desertion of men like John Churchill, who
owed him much and in whom he had trusted, the callous double
dealing of men like Sunderland, to whom he had confided his
affairs, the old man's despair, bewilderment, and piteous clinging
to his morsel of the true Cross&mdash;all these details have been used
very effectively by the champions of James II. Nor have they failed
to use the romantic incidents of the young Queen's huddling her
baby to her breast in the dark and cold on Whitehall Stairs,
waiting for French chivalry to rescue her from a nation of cads,
the fallen King stopped in his flight and roughly mauled by
fishermen in mistake for a "hatchet-faced Jesuit," and the still
more poignant episode, so galling to English pride, when the King
of England's sleep was disturbed by foreign guards as they were
taking the place of his own soldiery at his Palace gates.</p>

<p>The character of the Protestant hero or Great Deliverer does
not, as may be expected, shine in the eyes of those who extol the
man whom he displaced. He was, they declared, actuated by the
basest ambition, cloaked by a prudish display of piety; he gained
his ends by duplicity of the meanest sort, and was only successful
because he agreed to accept the Crown shorn of its fairest
prerogatives and because he was useful as a figurehead for the
rogues who engineered the Revolution. These Tory or Romanist
writers also pour contempt on the Englishmen who brought about this
crisis, describing them as members of a new, powerful, money-made
class who feared for their own estates and honours, and brought
about the downfall of James II for ignoble ends, which they
disguised under popular catchwords likely to receive the
approbation of the common man.</p>

<p>In the opinion of this school of writers, then, the "Great and
Glorious" Revolution was a sordid affair and the Great Deliverer a
paltry adventurer, using the pretence of the public good to gratify
private ambition and employing the most odious treachery to this
end. In brief, they consider that all the virtue, nobility, and
sincerity were on the side of the deposed King and that remnant of
the aristocracy who remained faithful to him in his downfall.</p>

<p>This latter school of historians has been no more scrupulous in
emphasising its points than were the Whig writers whose glaring
partiality their opponents so fiercely attacked. Examples of
violent bias, almost incredible in scholars of intelligence, occur
on each side of the question, and neither the defenders of the
Revolution, nor those who abuse it, shrink from half-truths,
suppression of evidence, bitter personal invective about the
reputations of men who have long since been unable to reply, special
pleading, and emotional appeal.</p>

<p>The labours of these zealots, who are often brilliant advocates,
masters of party tactics, and extremely able writers of political
pamphlets, have much obscured the issues and caused the plain man
to wonder what sort of truth it is that can be so variously and so
persuasively, represented. Loose thinking, fanaticism,
carelessness, sheer spite, and dishonest manipulation or ignoring
of material disfigure too many of the pages that re-tell this
episode of history.</p>

<p>There remain the excellent academic histories written by men who
had no personal interest in the causes or ideals that so excite
some writers, and it is to these that we must turn if we wish to
regain our sense of balance upset by the diatribes of those
hag-ridden by obsessions, or to satisfy our sense of justice
irritated by the sentimental and hysterical outpourings of those
who have set an idol up and must champion it, even against all
reason and common sense. The official historians have the fault of
their virtues in a certain frigid traditionalism, which, while
impartial and unprejudiced, tends to repeat disinterestedly former
judgments without either investigation or enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The history textbooks put into the hands of young scholars, for
instance, do tend to present stereotyped characters and scenes,
from which vitality is lacking and which are often marred by
definite distortion, due not to the maltreatment of fact, but to a
certain boredom felt by the writer and communicated to the reader.
It is not easy to find an account of such an event as the
Revolution of 1688 that is not either the work of a bigot, blinded
by his own ardour, or that of a scientific historian faintly
disgusted with dead politics.</p>

<p>We may hope, however, that, with all the material available one
of our modern men of letters who know so well how to write both
with impartiality and with zest, will give us a history of William
III and of 1688 that will put that curious personality and that
familiar but so often mishandled event in true proportions and
proper perspective.</p>

<p>Such a writer will draw on both Whig and Tory partisans, on
Protestant and Roman Catholic authorities, on the panegyrics of the
admirers of William III and on those of James II, and on the
handsomely documented labours of professional historians, and by
using his own acumen and judgment, he will arrive at some more or
less truthful picture of happenings that have caused such
impassioned controversy but that are, surely, now sufficiently
distant to be regarded by all save the zealot with impartial
detachment.</p>

<h3>THE MEANING OF THE REVOLUTION</h3>

<p class="first">
TO the serious student of humanity the interest of all
revolutions must largely lie in the question whether they are the
results of a resolute and prearranged attempt on the part of
thoughtful men to better, or change, a social system that has
proved a failure, or are more or less meaningless disturbances
provoked by adventurers for their own advantage. To this large
question those who are peculiarly interested in the story of
England may add another of local import&mdash;have the various revolts
and revolutions that have marked our annals been the fruits of the
heroic efforts of large-minded patriots that have developed the
nation along lines of steady progress, or have they been chance
upheavals caused by the intrigues of unscrupulous politicians or
the resistances of individual classes who have feared attacks on
their wealth or privileges?</p>

<p>The answers to these questions are not likely to be much in
dispute. It is hardly to be denied that at least the majority of
revolutions are not the work of good and noble men and do not
proceed on idealistic lines and that our own changes of government
did not result from the indignation of patriots wounded by the
cries of an oppressed people or from the inspiration of
lofty-minded idealists scheming Utopias, but from the complicated
motives and involved chicanery of classes and individuals working
for their own private gain or venting selfish discontents.</p>

<p>In the ranks of the poor and simple, in the humble men of the
Peasants' Revolt, in the followers of the Warbecks and Simnels, in
the rustics of Sedgemoor, in the Highlanders in 1715, 1745, might
have been found single-mindedness, faith, and pure intentions&mdash;in
their leaders, seldom or never.</p>

<p>The Revolution of 1688 had for so long such praise and acclaim
because it was so successful and because we have not very
substantially altered the constitution then accepted by King,
Estates, and people. It did produce a certain settlement of
national government that has held good ever since, and for that
reason it was for long venerated by most Englishmen, and commands,
even to-day, a certain measure of respect from the orthodox.
Rightly so, it would seem, for it may reasonably be argued that
what a people have left untouched for two hundred and fifty years
is more or less to their taste&mdash;or at least, to the taste of those
classes who have the power to effect changes.</p>

<p>The ugliest result of the Revolution&mdash;the spiteful laws against
Roman Catholics (though these were not nearly as severe as they
might have been)&mdash;was effaced over a hundred years ago, and, with
the exception of this, there was little in this adjustment of our
government which was to be so durable, that was not based on that
most solid of foundations&mdash;common sense. This steady structure that
the Revolution of 1688 left us was further strengthened by the
importation&mdash;by some fantastic shuffling of hereditary claims&mdash;of
foreign princes who had neither the ambition nor the abilities to
cause serious trouble. As such general satisfaction was given by
the Revolution (witness the utter failure of the various attempts
of the last of the Stewarts to disturb England), it might be
assumed that the Whig writers were correct in claiming it to be the
work of genuine lovers of their country, supremely anxious for her
good. It will be discovered, however, on a close inspection of the
facts, that the Tory writers are not without some truth in their
vehement assertions that the organisers of the train of events that
finally disposed of the House of Stewart were not only dishonest
men, but an unpleasant set of scoundrels.</p>

<p>How, then, did they come to accomplish a work that was so
lasting and useful, and what was the temper of the people whom they
beguiled into accepting it, and what were the positions and
characters of the two Kings <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto,</i>
who, the former by his failings, and the latter for ulterior
motives, played into the hands of these clever adventurers?</p>

<h3>ENGLAND FROM 1603&mdash;THE HOUSE OF STEWART</h3>

<p class="first">
TO understand this we must glance back very briefly at the
history of England to the year 1603. It was then, by an odd chance,
that the first Stewart King ascended the English Throne. His claim
came twice through the female side and had been so desperately
disputed by so many factions that he had only maintained it by
acquiescing in the execution of his mother from whom it came, and
by years of miserable truckling to the last of the Tudors. He was
grotesquely unfitted for the monarchy after which he gaped so
avidly, and is not admired even by the most fervent eulogists of
his House. There is at least a possibility that he was the son of
an obscure Italian adventurer; if he was legitimate he had
inherited none of that famous beauty and charm which went so far in
covering up the defects of the Stewarts.</p>

<p>This family have been sentimentalised and extolled to an
astonishing degree. Their attraction for the romancists seems to
consist in their misfortunes, which were largely their own fault.
The successive rulers produced by the marriage of Marjorie Bruce
and Walter Stewart (1315), parents of the first Stewart King,
Robert II, show several agreeable personalities who met the violent
ends usually meted out to the chieftains of barbaric peoples, and
one notable man, James IV, who was, however, so little of a
statesman as to risk serious issues on a chivalrous gesture.</p>

<p>Flodden Field is a superb subject for balladists, but is a sad
proof of the incapacity of the monarch who fell there. Sir David
Lindsay, in addressing verses to James IV, recited his
accomplishments, and then added: "with all this, sir, learn to be a
king." This was a lesson that none of the Stewarts, with the
exception, in a certain sense, of Charles II, ever did learn.</p>

<p>An ineffective Prince, James V, bequeathed his unstable Crown to
his daughter, Mary, whose story, essentially painful and sordid,
has received more attention than that of any but few other famous
women, until it glitters with all the splendour of what is known as
romance. Shorn of the muddled fancy and loose traditions that
cluster round her name, the false dazzle of poetry and fiction, the
tale of this Stewart Queen has an ugly, vulgar flavour and is far
more disgusting than entrancing.</p>

<p>Her claims to the English throne, which finally cost her her
life, brought the Stewarts to England. They had nothing of the
ability of the Plantagenets or the Tudors&mdash;there was never a Henry
II, an Edward I, a Henry VII, among them, and it is difficult to
understand why they have evoked such enthusiasm&mdash;an enthusiasm
sometimes amounting to a cult or an idolatry. They were probably no
worse than the contemporary sovereigns abroad, but not any better,
and of the four who sat on the English throne, two were completely
without the almost fabulous charm, wit, and fascination, for which
this family has such a glittering reputation. Charles I was
respectable, well-meaning, and governed with as much ability as
most kings of England, but lost his throne through his infringement
of the privileges of the wealthy middle-class and his use of shifty
policies that played into the hands of his opponents.</p>

<p>The people soon discovered, however, that they preferred the
tyranny of the regal tax-gatherers to the tyranny of the Republican
soldiery, and the recall of Charles II greatly pleased the majority
of the nation, who had certainly found both Puritanism and a
military autocracy highly objectionable.</p>

<p>The restored monarch was one of the most attractive of his
family, a gracious and agreeable man of the world, intelligent,
witty, and shrewd, of some culture and endowed with that gay
tolerance and that sense of comedy which make the perfect
companion. He has been over-popularised in the wrong way by the
gossip-writers of generations, whose avid interest in the meagre
details available about his kept women has obscured the more
important aspects of his character.</p>

<p>Anything in the nature of <i>chroniques scandaleuses</i> always
receives disproportionate importance in the estimation of the
uneducated, and though a most distinguished modern historian writes
of "the foul heart and evil mind of Charles II" and gravely tells
us that he "debauched a whole generation," it is surely doubtful
whether his example much affected more than a few of his subjects
or in anything altered the national character. The failure of
Oliver Cromwell's fanatic laws against vice had proved once more
that it is impossible to legislate for good morals, though good
policing will enforce good manners.</p>

<p>The English people, supposed to have been so sorely corrupted by
Charles II, quickly adopted at least an outward decorum when the
atmosphere of the Court changed, and under William III and Anne
were as well-behaved as they had been under Elizabeth or Charles
I.</p>

<p>Charles II was a clever politician and an adept at managing
internal affairs, though he was too much of a philosopher to take a
very keen zest in statesmanship as long as his own desires were
gratified. "It will all be the same a hundred years hence" might
have been a suitable summing-up of his attitude. His lack of moral
purpose and of moral strength led him into several disgraceful
actions, but it had some justification. It is only fair, when
considering him, to recall that sheet of blank paper he signed and
sent to the Parliament in a desperate attempt to save his father.
That was not the action of a cynic or a rogue and if Charles
afterwards developed a worldly indifferentism that often verged on
dishonesty and trickery, it is obvious that his early experiences
might easily have made him a far worse man than he was.</p>

<p>This kindly, skilful prince, after failing to secure a Catholic
revival, which would have swept away the last relics of a
Puritanism that he found so odious, concentrated on a French
alliance as a safeguard against another possible rebellion, and
then, on the realisation of his own continued lack of legitimate
issue, the preservation of the throne for the brother whom he was
the first to recognise as most unlikely to keep it. As regards the
causes of 1688, the most important events of the reign of Charles
II (apart from the character and career of James himself) are the
King's dependence on Louis XIV, which prevented England from
joining any affiance against France, and the marriage of Mary
Stewart, then heiress to the English crown, to the grandson of
Charles I, William of Orange, the man whose life work it was to
build up a coalition against the Bourbons and who passionately
desired adherence of England to his schemes.</p>

<p>The marriage of William and Mary was very naturally detestable
to James, then Duke of York, a zealous Roman Catholic who had a
deep antipathy to the country, the ideals, the religion, and the
character of his sister's son.</p>

<p>Charles II himself had been dubious about this scheme, but had
given way before the insistence of the bridegroom, the intrigues of
Danby, and the desire to make a popular gesture&mdash;the Protestant
marriage made a good effect upon a people always suspicious of the
Pope and the French.</p>

<p>There then seemed but little chance that the wife of the King,
Catherine of Braganza, or the Duchess of York would bear living
male children (the last lady bore a son, who did not live, soon
after the marriage), and the prospect of Mary's succession to the
throne appeared as certain as it was soothing to those (and they
were many) who disliked James and feared Charles.</p>

<p>The union that had pleased the two countries (for in the United
Provinces all save extreme Republicans were gratified by the royal
marriage of the Stadtholder), promised little personal happiness to
either groom or bride. Mary was an ignorant, frivolous, sentimental
girl of sixteen, already showing a taste for the coarse pleasures
of Whitehall, where she had just made her debut in a licentious
masque, and was absorbed in a neurotic schoolgirl friendship with
Anne Ashley, afterwards Lady Bathurst. She took her enforced
marriage with a bad grace and signalised nuptials that seemed
ill-starred indeed with hysterical scenes of tears and
lamentations.</p>

<p>Her cousin had not fascinated her at first sight, and had taken
no trouble to please his future wife, whom he had chosen from
obvious reasons of policy.</p>

<p>In fact, so tremendously did the marriage strengthen William of
Orange's position in England and in Europe, so greatly did it
increase his importance, socially and politically, so profoundly
did it anger Louis XIV, the patron and paymaster of Charles II and
the English Parliament, that it is astonishing that it was ever
allowed to take place.</p>

<p>On this one occasion, James showed shrewder insight than his
brother when he obstinately opposed the match that brought William
of Orange so near the English throne, and Charles, for his own
interest, paid too high for the Stadtholder's consent to the Peace
of Nijmegen, 1678.</p>

<p>This marriage was the first important appearance on the English
scene of the future William III, though he had been to England
before on a ceremonial and futile visit. He was, by reason of
birth, in a peculiar position among the princes of Europe, and, by
reason of his qualities, in a peculiar position among mankind.</p>

<p>Although he stood further from the English throne than his wife,
he was of nobler descent. Mary's mother was a commoner of a
middle-class family, the Hydes, raised to the peerage (the Earldom
of Clarendon) by political success, and Mary herself had only
barely escaped the fate of Monmouth, since her parents' marriage,
dishonourable to both of them, had been so disputed as only to be
saved by the careless tact of Charles II.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, an error to describe, as so many writers do,
Mary as being of "superior birth" to her husband. William of Orange
was descended in the direct male line from William the Silent, who
was, though bearing an ancient French title, the heir of
generations of Counts of Nassau, one of whom had been Emperor of
the West. His mother was Mary, eldest daughter of Charles I, and
through this proud melancholy woman who had died in the first weeks
of her brother's restoration, he inherited the claim to English
sovereignty, derived from Edward the Confessor, that was so much
respected.</p>

<p>His title of Orange (though the town and revenues remained in
the hands of Louis XIV) was <i>par la grce de Dieu</i>&mdash;that is,
an independent sovereignty, so that he acknowledged no overlord. He
held also several other notable lordships, and owned vast estates
and much personal wealth; his most precious possession, however,
was the extraordinary fame and honour that a succession of
remarkable men had given to his title, and that he himself had
embellished with an even more brilliant lustre.</p>

<p>His widowed mother had borne him in a shrouded, black-hung room
a year after the execution of her father, Charles I, and in the
total eclipse of her late husband's fortune. A stupid attempt at a
<i>coup d'tat</i> against that stolid bulwark of money-makers and
mercantile prosperity, Amsterdam, had cost the son of Frederic
Henry, the victor of Nieuport and one of the finest soldiers of his
day, all that the gratitude of the Dutch people had showered on the
"father of his country"&mdash;William I.</p>

<p>Heir, then, to a double misfortune, born prematurely, and so
delicate that his life was despaired of, William III of Orange
seemed to have but a dismal prospect before him in the year 1650.
As a direct result of the ill-judged audacity of William II, the
office of Stadtholder held by four princes of the House of Nassau
was abolished, and the very complicated government of the United
Provinces was administered by an oligarchy, at the head of which
was Johann de Witt (1625-1672), Grand Pensionary of the Province of
Holland, who, by methods not altogether candid, had made the
exclusion of the House of Orange from power, a condition of the
peace with Oliver Cromwell&mdash;First Treaty of Westminster, 1654.</p>

<p>The infant Prince, shorn of his ancestral glories, but still
regarded as their future hope by a large though, for the moment,
defeated party, was made a "child of state" and brought up under
the personal care of the Grand Pensionary.</p>

<p>This statesman was as honest and single-minded a man as any who
ever entered politics, and he applied himself with earnest
sincerity to the task of creating a patriotic republican out of the
heir of Nassau and Stewart. This endeavour, at once idealistic and
clumsy, was a total failure. The boy, isolated, unhappy, strictly
trained; cherishing a bitter sense of wrong, showed remarkable
signs of intellectual precocity, which impressed all who met him,
and an extraordinary firmness of character, which raised very high
the expectations of his numerous adherents. He soon made it
perfectly clear that he intended to fight, inch by inch, all who
opposed a complete return of the posts and honours he considered
due to his birth.</p>

<p>His position had been strengthened by the restoration (1660) of
his uncle and guardian, Charles II, who, with his brothers, James
and Henry, had passed part of his exile on his nephew's estates.
Mary had lavishly helped her brothers and had impoverished her
son's estates to do so, and Charles showed same lukewarm gratitude
in halfhearted attempts to help the son of the sister who had
almost ruined herself to help him in his misery.</p>

<p>It was not, however, either to the active intrigues of the
Orange party or to the deep affection of the Dutch for the
descendant of William the Silent, or to the lazy efforts of his
royal uncle that the young Prince was to owe his reinstatement to
the forfeited honours of his House with the addition of more power
than any former Stadtholder of Holland had ever dreamed of
possessing.</p>

<h3>THE RISE TO POWER OF WILLIAM OF ORANGE</h3>

<p class="first">
JOHANN DE WITT and his brother, Cornelius, the Admiral, and
those associated with them in the government were idealists,
pacifists, republicans, and men of rare integrity, industry, and
zeal for the public welfare. They amassed no personal fortune,
grasped at no personal honours, and held themselves, as far as
possible, above the shifts and tricks employed by all the
politicians of Europe. Johann de Witt, with his spotless private
reputation, his austere public life, his stern simplicity, and
unbending dignity, affected the character of a Roman
magistrate&mdash;and was almost a symbolic figure of incorruptible
justice, piety, domestic virtue, and patriotic ardour. His brother,
Cornelius, was in character similar, though bolder and harsher, and
a famous admiral, even among the naval officers of a people then
master of the sea, and had finely distinguished himself in three
wars.</p>

<p>The faults of the Grand Pensionary were obstinacy,
narrow-mindedness, lack of worldly wisdom, and, possibly,
self-conceit. He did not, at least, find it easy to admit himself
mistaken or in the wrong, and his very virtues had that excess
which shows that lack of humour, of wit, and of sense of proportion
which so often springs from over self-confidence.</p>

<p>De Witt's piety tended to bigotry, his patriotism to party
politics, his idealism hardened into a stubborn adherence to
preconceived ideas. Being so passionately a republican he deplored
deeply the ascendancy gained by the House of Orange in the
Netherlands, and concentrated all his talents on keeping the young
Prince and his partisans out of any semblance of power. He showed
considerable skill in dealing with foreign policy, particularly in
accommodating himself to the violent changes of government in
England, and he saw Holland through three naval wars&mdash;the first
Anglo-Dutch War, 1652-1654, War in the Baltic, 1656-1660, the
second Anglo-Dutch War, 1665-1667&mdash;which were all to her advantage
and her glory. He also did his best to remain on good terms with
France, whose King was beginning to show signs of that thirst for
the revival of the Western Empire of Charlemagne which was to
convulse Europe for forty years (1672-1713). In all his actions
this upright man showed that "clear and round dealing" which
Francis Bacon declared "is the honour of man's nature."</p>

<p>Too much of De Witt's attention, however, was taken up with
curbing the growing ambition of William of Orange, and in checking
the intrigues of his numerous adherents. There is no doubt that he
introduced some personal bitterness into this contest and that he
was quite unable to see any good in the parties opposed to his own.
This feeling, the Prince, who had during a lonely childhood brooded
deeply over his own wretched position and the past splendours of
his ancestors, fiercely returned. Between the middle-aged
experienced statesman and the youth scarcely free from tutelage,
something like hatred passed.</p>

<p>It was the same kind of animosity, at once political and
personal, as that exchanged between Maurice of Orange and Johann
van Olden Barneveldt. By the year 1672, it might have been clear to
an impartial observer that the same country could not long continue
to hold two such conflicting personalities as William of Orange and
Johann de Witt.</p>

<p>A totally unexpected catastrophe soon removed the elder man from
the scene and put the younger in possession of all the power and
responsibility that he had longed for since he had been able to
spell over a history book. Johann de Witt, despite his gifts and
virtues, committed the one crime never pardoned in a statesman&mdash;he
failed, and through a blunder. He entirely misunderstood the
character of the man who sat on the throne of France. This country,
which had steadily increased in importance since it was first
consolidated by the genius of Louis XI, was then ruled by an
absolute monarch, the third king of the House of Bourbon, who had
inherited the magnificent organisation, the superb public servants,
the wealth, commerce, security abroad, and prosperity at home,
built up by the great Cardinal Richelieu and his successor, the
Italian Mazarin. This prince, Louis XIV, King of France and
Navarre, was a man of mediocre intelligence, poor education, and
negative personal qualities; he was, moreover, obsessed with a
vanity and bigotry that increased until insanity seemed to dictate
his policies (Revocation of Edict of Nantes, 1685).</p>

<p>It might be argued that there was something insane about the
invasion of the Netherlands in 1672 for no better reason than a
desire to show off the armies Louvois had organised, and Turenne
and Cond led, and because of offence taken at derisive medals and
pamphlets struck and issued in Holland.</p>

<p>A miserable and suppressed childhood and a limited fund of
common sense had given Louis a half-crazy idea of his own
importance, which caused him to irk at the very thought of the
existence of this prosperous little nation of traders, bankers, and
farmers, who knew so well how to regulate their own affairs, and
who held such an important place in Europe with such impressive
dignity. The haughty Prince with mighty engines for mischief ready
to his wilful hand desired to wipe out this "nation of shopkeepers
who smelt of cheese." When he learned that a medal had been struck
showing M. Van Berningen, the Dutch Ambassador at Paris, as Joshua
telling the sun to stop, with obvious reference to his own fancy to
be known as "roi soleil" or "Phoebus," he decided that only the
devastation of an entire nation could fitly avenge the insult.</p>

<p>The attack that this magnificently equipped King launched on the
unsuspicious Provinces was one that Johann de Witt was totally
unprepared to meet.</p>

<p>The blind trust in his good luck, which so often betrays the
idealist, had let the Grand Pensionary neglect even reasonable
precautions against a possible war. He had ruled for twenty years
with ability and honesty five of the Seven Provinces (Friesland and
Groningen remained staunch to their Stadtholders of a cadet branch
of the House of Nassau) and held his own in the extremely difficult
European situation, but he had made no provision whatever for such
a catastrophe as now befell a people who had been unmolested,
comfortable, and prosperous since they had finally shaken free from
Philip II nearly a hundred years before' and who considered
themselves secured by the Peace of Westphalia. Johann de Witt
trusted in the good faith of England, nominal ally of the Provinces
by the Triple Alliance, 1668, and he did not know of the secret
Treaty of Dover, 1670, or guess at the callous betrayal that
Charles II was intending. Sweden, the third member of the Alliance,
also deserted De Witt.</p>

<p>The army, which under Maurice and Frederic Henry had constituted
the foremost military school of Europe and won victory after
victory, was almost non-existent, the fortifications had been
neglected, the people, after two generations of peace, were utterly
untrained for modern warfare, to which all their interests and
tastes were opposed. It was inevitable, under these circumstances,
that the panic resultant on a rapid foreign invasion without a
declaration of war, which the country was helpless to withstand,
should quickly culminate in a violent revolution.</p>

<p>The French under Cond, shouting "Death to the vermin!" entered
the country by the famous passage of the Rhine, termed by Napoleon
I "a fourth-rate military exploit," and at once occupied the whole
Province of Utrecht.</p>

<p>The people, happy and prosperous under Johann de Witt but faced
with utter ruin through organised robbery and murder on an
overwhelming scale (Louis's much-advertised campaign, stripped of
all the laurels, gilding, the Te Deums and Court panegyrics, was
merely an act of banditry), blamed their unlucky representative for
their plight.</p>

<p>Nor did the Orange party, representing the aristocracy, the
professional soldiers, and many of the wealthy burghers, fail to
point to the empty arsenals and unstocked granaries, the decayed
forts, the skeleton regiments, the miserable remnant of the superb
fighting equipment created and fostered by the House of Orange.
Again, though the charge of corruption against the government was
unjust, it was true that many of the merchant class, supporters of
De Witt, had been unable, either too confident or too careless, to
refrain from selling to France saltpetre, lead, and other materials
of war, which were to be used for their own destruction.</p>

<p>De Witt was then, not unreasonably, accused of neglect, of
nepotism&mdash;too many of his incapable relations were in official
posts&mdash;and finally in the popular anguish, as town after town fell
before the march of the finest troops in the world, of selling his
country to France.</p>

<p>In a panic of excitement, the man who had been for so long
esteemed and trusted, was cast from office while supreme power in
field and cabinet was given to the Prince, who had for the
twenty-two years of his life been painstakingly kept in the
background. Political agitators, inspired by De Witt's enemies,
helped to fan the flame that, at the touch of personal peril,
sprang from the long-smouldering discontents against the party in
power.</p>

<p>Sir William Temple had some while before noted a growing
restlessness against the De Witt oligarchy&mdash;and thought it only due
to "the desire of those who have long been out, to get in."</p>

<p>In 1672 more poignant motives inspired the people; they felt
themselves directly betrayed by the staunch Republican's reversal
of the military rule of the House of Orange, if not by his
acceptance of French gold, and their vengeance was swift, crude,
and terrible.</p>

<p>Cornelius de Witt was falsely accused of an attempt to
assassinate the young Prince, in whose life the very existence of
the United Provinces seemed bound up. The staunch, honest man, who
had so valiantly served his country, was put to the torture and
lodged in the Gevangenpoort at the Hague, the hideous prison of the
Spanish Inquisition, which was a relic of Philip II's rule.</p>

<p>There, on August 22nd, the fallen statesman, for twenty years
the most important man in the country, visited his sick brother,
the mob surrounded the prison and became so threatening that the
magistrates, with unaccountable cowardice or contemptible malice,
ordered the withdrawal of Count Tilly's guard. The people then
broke into the room where the De Witt brothers awaited with serene
courage the incredible atrocity of their end.</p>

<p>They were dragged out and murdered, with every circumstance that
the barbaric ignorance of panic cruelty could devise, and their
bodies were treated with revolting bestiality of an unprintable
nature.</p>

<p>William of Orange has been regarded as responsible for this
crime, or at least as approving of it when it was accomplished.
This will always be a matter for dispute. Orangist agents, notably
one Michael Tichelear, undoubtedly inflamed the mob, and several of
them drew pensions all their lives from William's estates; it would
also have been possible for the Prince to have come to the Hague
and to have calmed the furious crowd, and he made no attempt to
punish the murderers, even by a rebuke, though he dismissed the
magistrates who had not been able to keep order.</p>

<p>Thus much against the young Stadtholder; for him it may be
argued that the De Witts were so completely ruined that they were
no longer in his way, and that their deaths brought him no
advantage. Nor was he of a vindictive nature, but remarkably
indifferent to personal injuries. He afterwards passed his word
that he had not been cognisant of the crime, and his personal
honour was not lightly pledged.</p>

<p>If may be doubted if, in the chaotic state of the country, he
could have brought the ringleaders of the murderers to justice, or
could have prevented the mangled remains of these great men from
being "swept with a broom into obscure graves." He may have felt
towards Michael Tichelear as his ancestress, Mary Stewart,
expressed herself about Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh when he
assassinated Moray, her half-brother, the Regent: "I did not
command the deed, but Bothwellhaugh shall have a pension."</p>

<p>When Johann de Witt had appealed to the Prince to justify him
against the accusations of peculation, maladministration, and
treachery that were overwhelming him, William had replied by a
letter that has been considered as ungenerous as it was clever. It
contained, however, only the truth&mdash;the young Stadholder had always
bitterly opposed on the basic principles of hatred all the policies
of De Witt and fiercely resented the defenceless condition of his
country&mdash;nor had he concealed these feelings.</p>

<p>He was, therefore, justified in saying so when appealed to in
this desperate crisis; he was also correct in adding, with that
severe disdain which he always applied to popular excitements&mdash;"as
to the libels and pamphlets, even I have not been exempt from
them." He was, indeed, to be traduced and slandered as
unscrupulously and as persistently as any other public man has ever
been, and even now it is not easy to discern the real man behind
the clamours of party adulation and party spite.</p>

<p>Of one thing there can, however, be no doubt, and that is his
behaviour in 1672. Only the bigoted or the callous could deny the
epithet "heroic" to this, and to those who respond to the
fascination of unshakable fortitude in the face of supreme disaster
there is something peculiarly moving about the entry of the forlorn
young Prince on the sordid scene of European politics.</p>

<p>All the incidents of his rise to power were highly
dramatic&mdash;indeed, his whole life was extraordinary, romantic, and
tragic, full of action, important events and swift changes of
fortune. About his character was an air of greatness not to be
discerned in any other public man of his day. This is to be
ascribed to the fact that he and he alone did not stand for merely
personal ambition or personal glory, but some absolute ideal, which
he describes again and again as <i>la cause commune</i> and for
which he was prepared to make endless sacrifices.</p>

<p>This steady adherence to an ideal gives a nobility to his entire
career&mdash;magnanimous is the epithet best suited to a Prince of whom
nothing mean or petty is known. <i>La cause commune</i> was the
unification of Europe against the power of France.</p>

<h3>POSITION OF WILLIAM OF ORANGE, 1672-1678</h3>

<p class="first">
IF there was any germ of statecraft behind the flamboyant
invasion of the United Provinces, backed by careful alliances, as
it was, it was to attack eventually the Holy Roman Empire, then
under the loose and languid rule of the Habsburgs, who were, in the
opinion of Louis XIV, wearing the imperial diadem that was his own
due. Briefly, the aim of the Bourbon was to over-run Europe,
crushing out Protestantism in his stride, and the aim of William of
Orange was to prevent him. Seldom can a task have seemed more
hopeless than this appeared in 1672.</p>

<p>William was not, however, as he was so often represented, merely
"The Protestant Hero"&mdash;"a man raised up by God...whom He had made
strong for Himself" as Bishop Burnet thought him to be. His aims
were political more than religious; he desired toleration for all
creeds and security for his own, but he was allied, during nearly
the whole of his life, to the Emperor and the King of Spain; some
of his earliest companions in arms and firmest friends, Lorraine,
Montecuculi, Vaudemont, were Roman Catholics, and in 1688, by dint
of incessant tact and unswerving patience, he stood higher in the
regard of the Pope, Innocent XI, than either Louis XIV or James II
and was able to gain the tacit assent of the Vatican to the
dethronement of a fanatic Roman Catholic.</p>

<p>It might well be argued that a truly lofty and philosophic mind
would not have devoted itself with such zest to mundane affairs and
that a wider view would have discerned no particular reason for
checking the Bourbons, since their rule was likely to be as good as
that of any other potentate or ruling combination of parties, it
might be contended that Calvinism was not an admirable creed worth
fighting for, and that the independence of the United Provinces was
not worth involving Europe in war after war to preserve it.</p>

<p>If, however, a statesman takes this long view he is apt either
to become, like Charles II, cynically indifferent to the way things
drift, or, like Sir William Temple, to retire in disdain to peach
growing and essay writing.</p>

<p>"The government of the world is a great thing; but it is a very
coarse one, too, compared with the fineness of speculative
knowledge," meditated Lord Halifax.</p>

<p>William III cast no such scornful disinterested glance on the
mundane scene into which he made so tempestuous an entry in 1672.
He was passionately of his own time, deeply concerned in the events
taking place about him, painfully serious in his approach to
religion, politics, and those abstractions, liberty, patriotism,
honour, and justice, that easy men of the world are ashamed to take
seriously. All that even his enemies can say against his earnest
behaviour in 1672 is that he was actuated by ambition and seized
the opportunity of his country's downfall for his own
advantage.</p>

<p>There may be some truth in this accusation; it is almost
impossible to decide how far the actions of any man are inspired by
personal and how far by public motives.</p>

<p>William III certainly demanded full powers and ample trust from
the alarmed people who turned to him in despair. But once having
obtained them, he neither abused the first nor betrayed the second.
He had ample opportunity and temptation to do so. When he rose to
eminence at the age of twenty-one he found himself Captain-General
of a small army miserably equipped and disorganised, falling back
from frontiers already in the hands of the enemy, first magistrate
of a state confused by an invasion and distracted by a revolution,
a Prince with royal connections&mdash;Louis XIV was his second cousin,
and Louis's ally, Charles II, his uncle&mdash;who was the chief
magistrate of a republic and sole commander of her defences.</p>

<p>His task seemed in the eyes of his contemporaries ludicrously
hopeless. The Dutch themselves had no spirit of resistance left and
were for accepting any humiliating terms Louis might deign to fling
them. Nor was William regarded by either of the two Kings as
offensive. They considered that he, too, had been wronged by the
insolent burghers, bankers, and tradespeople for whom they were
preparing so grievous a punishment. Louis was willing to be
generous to a cadet of his own House, and Charles was
good-naturedly disposed towards his sister's son. It was suggested
that William should surrender the few towns left him, and that in
return, when France dismembered the United Provinces, he should
receive, out of the remnants, a little Duchy or Princedom under the
sovereignty of Louis. This, together perhaps with the <i>bton</i>
of a <i>marchal de France</i> and the hand of one of Louis's
bastard daughters, was considered by Louis and Charles very
handsome provision for a man of their own class, so unfortunately
involved with Republicans and Puritans.</p>

<p>William had, however, some very positive qualities, among them
the rare virtue of patriotism. He really loved his country&mdash;that
precise, neat, handsome, and prosperous land raised and kept by the
incessant labour of her inhabitants above the sea&mdash;"the valiant
sandbank" roused in William the warmest feelings of pride and
affection. He was also deeply attached to his hereditary Faith and
cherished a keen sense of personal honour&mdash;sentiments scarcely to
be understood by his opponents. Added to this were a tenacity of
purpose, an indomitable fortitude, and a stern resolution that have
seldom been equalled, and that from his first appearance on the
European scene profoundly impressed the world.</p>

<p>To these uncommon moral and intellectual qualities (his
mentality within the limits of a material scope was of a very high
order) was joined a courage that nothing could shake. A member of
that nation which William spent his entire energies in fighting
gives this character of the Dutch Prince. "Un prince profond dans
ses vues, habile  former des ligues et  runir les esprits...plus
 craindre encore dans le secret du cabinet, qu'  la tte des
armes; un ennemi que la haine du nom franais avoit rendu capable
d'imaginer de grandes choses et de les excuter; un de ces gnies
qui semblent ns pour mouvoir a leur gr les peuples et les
souverains; un grand homme."</p>

<p>His behaviour in the crisis of the summer and autumn of 1672 is
best related in the words of contemporaries.</p>

<p>Sir William Temple, his friend who had always admired him,
wrote: "The bait which the French thought could not fail of being
swallowed by the Prince, and about which the utmost artifice was
employed, was the proposal of making him sovereign of the Provinces
under the sovereignty of England and France. And, to say truth, at
a time when so little of the Provinces was left, and what remained
was under water, and in so imminent a danger upon the first frosts
of winter, this seemed a lure to which a meaner soul than that of
the Prince might very well stoop. But he was above it, and his
answers, always firm, that he would never betray a trust that was
given him nor ever sell the liberties of his country that his
ancestors had so long defended. Yet the game he played was then
considered so desperate that one of his nearest servants told me
that he had often expostulated it with his master and had asked him
at last 'How he intended to live after Holland was lost?'</p>

<p>"The Prince replied that he was resolved to live upon the lands
he had left in Germany, and that he would rather pass his life in
hunting there than sell his country or his liberty to France at any
price."</p>

<p>Of William's situation the Duke of Buckingham, who did not know
or like him, wrote, as one of Charles' Commissioners in
Holland:</p>

<p>"We lost no time in endeavouring to ease his (William's) mind
from the reproaches he made us upon the subject of the war, by
letting him know in confidence to himself that His Majesty (Charles
II) would not be brought to begin it till he had conditioned that
the Prince should find his account in it...we advised him to
bethink himself well not only to remove the war out of his country,
but to establish himself a sovereignty over it, wherein both Kings
(Louis and Charles) would secure him at home and abroad from all
dangers.</p>

<p>"He replied that he liked better the condition of Stadtholder,
that they had given him and that he believed himself obliged in
conscience and honour not to prefer his interest before his
obligation."</p>

<p>Gilbert Burnet, who admired, but did not understand or much like
William, thus describes the English attempt to bribe the newly
appointed Stadtholder:</p>

<p>"That Prince (William) was so lifted up, that he seemed to
consider the King (Charles) very little...The Duke (Buckingham), at
parting, pressed him much to put himself in the King's hands. The
Prince cut him short; he said that his country had trusted him and
that he would never deceive or betray them for any base ends of his
own.</p>

<p>"The Duke answered that he was not to think any more of his
country, for it no longer existed...and he repeated the words often
'Do you not see that it is lost?'</p>

<p>"The Prince said, he saw it was indeed in great danger, but
there was a sure way never to see it lost, and that was to die in
the last ditch."</p>

<p>This expression has passed into the English language, but
reference is seldom made to its originator. Curiously, too, it is
meaningless to us, for the reference is to the cutting of dykes,
the desperate expedient whereby the higher levels of Holland had
been saved, by flooding the parts below sea-level, thus ringing the
Province with water as a defence. William meant that he would cut
one dyke (ditch) after another and perish in the last.</p>

<p>Burnet also describes the young Prince as speaking passionately
"to the amazement of all who heard him" to a packed assembly of the
States General, persuading them in an oration of "nearly three
hours" (probably an overstatement) that it was possible to defend
themselves, even at that desperate juncture, thus putting "new life
into a country almost dead with fear and dispirited with so many
losses."</p>

<p>That these speeches and gestures were not mere bravado, William
proved by his subsequent conduct. Both as a statesman and as a
soldier he was successful. He did not achieve any spectacular
victory, for he was no match for Cond at Seneffe ("Would I had
once served under him before serving against him!"), nor could he
take Maastricht. But with the capture of Grave, the fall of Bonn,
and the juncture then with Montecuculi, 1673, the Emperor's general
marching from Vienna, the French were definitely checked, and, in
two campaigns, the young Stadtholder had driven the enemy out of
the country, consolidated for ever his domestic position, and
become one of the most important factors in European politics.</p>

<p>The peace (that of Nijmegen, 1678) to which he was being forced
when he appeared at Whitehall as a suitor for his cousin's hand,
was far from his liking, but it was also far from being as
detrimental to the United Provinces as the terms Louis had tossed
to the States General in 1672.</p>

<p>William had also made an alliance with Spain, with Frederic
William, the Great Elector of Brandenburg, his relation by
marriage, and with the Emperor, as well as established for himself
a considerable party in England, and already enjoyed the honour, as
one historian puts it, "of being the second personage in
Europe"&mdash;Louis XIV having first place.</p>

<h3>THE CHARACTER OF WILLIAM III</h3>

<p class="first">
THE Prince who was in this peculiar and important position, had
a bizarre personality, to some fascinating, to others repellent;
the chances of his birth and upbringing governed his whole life. It
is impossible to imagine him other than a Prince, a Calvinist, and
a Dutchman. He was one of those who eagerly embrace the destiny
marked out for them, he made no effort to evade the obligations
laid on him by the name he inherited, or to escape any of the
fatigues, anxieties, and labours attendant on the course on which
he embarked at the beginning of his career and from which he never
deviated.</p>

<p>Charles II had early given up all attempts to seduce his nephew
into his own easy policies because he found him "too passionately
Dutch and Protestant." Indeed, it is difficult to find in history
any statesman who served with such single-mindedness of purpose as
William III during thirty years served his purpose of obtaining
security for the United Provinces and liberty of conscience to
which was inevitably joined the endeavour to check the power of
France.</p>

<p>This aim&mdash;the balance of power&mdash;may have had a national, even a
party flavour, but it was as high an aspiration as any that
animated a Richelieu, a Louis XI, a Cecil, or a Henry VII.</p>

<p>Personal ambition, as his enemies aver, may have mingled with
this design. William was of autocratic sentiments, a professional
ruler, a professional soldier, accustomed to rule in closet as in
camp, and irking at restraint or opposition as much as any Stewart
King. But it is impossible to read his huge correspondence, kept up
with tireless energy through sickness, defeat, failure, and sorrow,
without realising the intense sincerity and simplicity of the
resolve that lay behind the weary shifts, intrigues, submissions,
and schemes to which the overworked, harassed, handicapped man was
forced to set his hand. There is something poignant, almost
painful, in this burning earnestness for a "cause" in a period when
there were few who were earnest about anything save their personal
advantages.</p>

<p>Such was the Prince who in 1678 brought himself a step nearer to
the English throne by his marriage with Mary Stewart. In his
private character he was very different from the type then
fashionable at Whitehall, the Bucking-hams, the Rochesters, the
Sedleys. He was, what was very curious to the English courtiers,
respectable.</p>

<p>Sir William Temple, his close friend, had noted that he was
without any "admixture of vice" and he maintained in his bachelor
Court and in his camp the dignified decorum in which he had been
severely trained, and that was the inflexible custom of his
country. Neither then nor at any other time could the activities of
the lampoonists whom William had so early noted with contempt, do
more than cast the slur of invented slanders against his name.
These aspersions, largely resting, professional libellers apart, on
a clumsy sentence of Bishop Burnet's (interpolated into a late
edition of his unreliable Memoirs), which probably relates to Lady
Betty Villiers, have been eagerly seized upon by the apologists of
the Stewarts, but have no foundation whatever, and only show the
depths to which spite will descend when trying to find a weak spot
in a moral character.</p>

<p>William was not, of course, true to his "legend" any more than
any other historical figure. "The lips of ice, the heart of fire,"
the unmoved Caesarean calm, the cold cutting word, the iron
fortitude, the persistent silence, and so on, all these
characteristics have been overstressed for the sake of dramatic
effect, even by his admirers.</p>

<p>William had remarkable self-control and never lost his head in a
crisis, but he was a human being, not a figurehead. His feelings
were passionate, his senses acute, and he often expressed himself
warmly and even violently, nor was he always in the midst of a
battle or seated before a pile of State papers. He hunted, played
cards and billiards, was a dilettante in pictures, gardens, and
architecture, had a genius for friendship, was careful by principle
and extravagant on occasion, could joke, enjoy a camp story, have
twenty-five violins to divert him when he was melancholy, and was
capable of transports of affection and agitated alternations
between hope and despair that threw him into illness and tears.</p>

<p>His appearance has also been grotesquely conventionalised by
adulators and caricaturists.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Great Nassau, who to Kneller's hand decree'd<br>
To fix him graceful on the Bounding Steed,"</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
was unfortunate, indeed, in the versifiers and artists who
endeavoured to perpetuate his achievements and his person with such
dismal results in bombastic heroics and distorted daubs.</p>

<p>His person, tempting to the caricaturists and easily invested
with a heraldic, almost a symbolic aspect, was speedily familiar
throughout Europe, where the aquiline laurelled head with the
cluster of oranges stood, even to the ignorant observer, for a
whole chapter of contemporary politics. The man himself had an
impressive public appearance, though short, slight, and of "a crazy
constitution." His long, dark, melancholy features resembled those
of his mother and her brother, the Duke of Gloucester; there was
nothing Nordic about the Italianate appearance of this passionate
Dutchman.</p>

<p>His energy, his absorption in the business in hand, his
knowledge of every detail, of every enterprise that he undertook,
an innate candour and absence of vitality made him admired and
obeyed by those whom he led and gained him an unusual number of
devoted friends.</p>

<p>"I was not born fearful," he wrote to Arlington, who had been
threatening him with De Witt's fate, and there was a resplendency
about his courage, moral and physical, that deeply impressed his
contemporaries. "I did not mention the murderers, thinking it
beneath me," he wrote later in his life, the occasion being an
opportunity of protesting to France against their employment of
assassins to dispose of him.</p>

<p>His one showy gift was superb horsemanship; for the rest, he was
totally without the art or the wish to please. He was not
universally popular in his own country&mdash;Amsterdam, where French and
Republican interest was always strong, successor to Antwerp in the
importance of her international finance, was his declared opponent,
and attempted, particularly under the Burgomaster De Witzen, to
frustrate and thwart all his policies.</p>

<p>When this Prince left England with his childish and reluctant
bride, it was to devote himself to effacing the effects of a peace
(Nijmegen), to him almost shameful, by preparing for another war.
His chief desire in the slow and cautious combinations he was
making against Louis XIV was to detach England from her French
Alliance and bring her into opposition to the Bourbons; his
political plan turned on an endeavour to bring back the balance
given to the interests of Europe by the Treaty of Westphalia,
1648.</p>

<h3>JAMES II</h3>

<p class="first">
THE father of Mary Stewart is the other notable figure of the
Revolution, the King <i>de jure,</i> who has been blamed and
praised as vehemently as the son-in-law who took his place.</p>

<p>This Prince had always been unfortunate, a youth of poverty and
exile was followed by twenty years of humiliation as heir-apparent
to his brother. A firm adherence to an unpopular Faith, carried to
obstinate bigotry, deprived him of public office. He had to resign
his work at the Admiralty, which he had been carrying out with zeal
and industry, and to pass his time in gloomy inactivity, sometimes
in exile in Edinburgh, or Brussels, sometimes in England, anxiously
watching his chances of succession to the throne, which seemed
likely to be jeopardised not by his brilliant son-in-law, but by
the dull James Waters, Duke of Monmouth, King Charles' favourite
illegitimate son, about whose birth a number of silly tales, very
disturbing to James, were hatched by unscrupulous politicians.
There is very little to chronicle about James, who seems not to
have had a single taste, gift, or interest beyond his fanaticism
and his debauchery. This vice was of the most sordid kind. The
amours of Charles II, despite all the prettifying of the gossip
writers, are dull enough, but those of his brother lack any kind of
interest&mdash;James was that unattractive type, sourly gloomy and
grossly licentious. The only woman of sense on whom his favours
fell, Catherine Sedley, took his money and mocked him as a
fool.</p>

<p>He took part in a naval action, the second Battle of Solebay, or
Southwold, June, 1665, when the Dutch under Obdam were defeated,
not without incurring some censure on his personal courage; but the
tale that he ordered his flagship to sail out of action is
unproved, and some writers speak in praise of his behaviour on this
occasion. Confirmation is not lacking, however, of his active
cruelty, though there seem to be two opinions about his physical
courage. To order death or torture for political offenders was the
custom of the age, but James liked to see these punishments
inflicted, especially on the persons of Scottish Covenanters.</p>

<p>Thus, as he was without wit, generosity, sensitiveness,
imagination, or compassion, it was not strange that he was without
friends and intensely unpopular, both with his own class and the
people. His manners were good, but he had none of the legendary
Stewart charm, and on public occasions was often ungracious with
the sour gloom of the disappointed and the inadequate.</p>

<p>His first marriage was the result of an intrigue with Anne Hyde,
one of his sister's ladies and daughter of the first Earl of
Clarendon. So little desire had he to marry her after the
Restoration that he bribed a boon companion to swear he was also
her accepted lover.</p>

<p>This union, so sordid on both sides, produced two Queens of
England, Mary and Anne. James showed some affection towards the
younger girl, but was cold in all his relationships, though the
noisy, passionate protests of his second wife, the handsome young
Italian, Maria Beatrix d'Este, backed as it was by the threats of
her priests, moved him to some intermittent marital fidelity,
though even in his old age and defeat in Ireland he had two "old
trollops" to comfort him in his distress.</p>

<p>There is a natural wish to be just towards one so unfortunate,
so abused, and so unattractive, but it is indeed difficult to see,
while keeping to the language of truth, what can be said for James
II. Even if one regards him as a man inspired by an intense
religious conviction, he still appears incredibly wrong-headed and
obtuse, for it was his actions that set back the cause of
toleration a hundred years. The disabilities under which Roman
Catholics were to suffer until the nineteenth century were directly
due to the blunderings of their own champion. The miseries of the
English reprisals in Ireland that completed the ruin of a country
already atrociously treated by Cromwell were due to the action of
James in interfering with the rights of the Protestant colonial
majority.</p>

<p>In person James was tall, elegant, fair-headed with fine
features marred by a sneer of forbidding bitterness. "A plain man
in his nightgown" noted Pepys, but in the magnificent Riley in the
National Collection, James is a kingly figure who carries his
trappings well. He lacked grievously a sense of humour and both his
portraits and his history suggest that he was dyspeptic.</p>

<p>His letters are inelegant and the laconic commonplace of which
they are composed seems a not unfair estimate of his ability. His
memoirs, which we have not altogether at first hand, have been much
stressed as showing his political acumen and his religious
enthusiasm. Even if we allow that they are wholly his own, they
give no different interpretation of his character from what we
might have gathered from his actions and his behaviour.</p>

<h3>FROM THE MARRIAGE TO THE REVOLUTION</h3>

<p class="first">
THE ten years that passed between 1678-1688 formed a rare
interval of peace in Western Europe. In the East the Emperor, with
the aid of mercenaries and volunteers, was holding back the Turks,
but for the rest the smouldering causes of dispute had not broken
into actual flame.</p>

<p>France was pre-eminent; she was still enjoying the mercantile
prosperity that had reached its apogee under Colbert, 1665-1673,
her armies and her generals were without rivals. Even after the
death of Turenne at Salzbach after his most brilliant campaign and
the hideous outrages in the Palatinate, 1675, and the retirement of
Cond in the same year, there remained Catinat and Luxembourg,
hunchbacked, loathed by the King, suspected of poisoning and the
black arts, but undefeated in the field, and Vauban, greatest of
military engineers, who had taken Maastricht in William III's first
campaign.</p>

<p>Added to her substantial power and wealth, France enjoyed an
enormous prestige in the arts, in fashions, in all that appertained
to worldliness, brilliancy, wit, pleasure, and splendour. In every
department of seventeenth-century civilisation France dazzled even
those of her contemporaries most alarmed or offended by her
arrogant pretensions. Her own inhabitants were oblivious of drained
resources while blinded by the beams of glory and national pride,
both most cleverly exploited.</p>

<p>The English King, to render himself independent of Parliament
and to secure himself against such another revolt as had dethroned
his father, became a pensioner of France. Almost every member of
Parliament and most of the men who conducted the King's policies
were also in the pay of the French; this widespread corruption
reduced England to a cipher in European politics. In so far as this
kept her out of war and thus allowed a long period of peaceful
development, besides exhausting a rival nation's capital, it was
not an ill thing for the English people.</p>

<p>But it was lowering to the national prestige, and though life
might have been easy enough to many people, a government that
starved the public services, sent rotten ships and unpaid sailors
to sea, while loose women, panders, jobbers, and parasites lived in
extravagant luxury either at the expense of the national revenue or
by means of bribes from a foreigner, could scarcely, by any
standard, be termed a good government, or one that was likely to
last.</p>

<p>The growth of English democracy in the first half of the
seventeenth century, the heritage of the political thought of the
Reformers, the groping after a definite philosophy of government
already manifest in the writings and efforts of several thoughtful
men, could not remain long satisfied with this loose opportunist
rule.</p>

<p>Nor were the strong Puritan element and the innately independent
spirit of the common people other than offended, while powerful
business interests, represented by the City of London, were wary
and watchful. National finance, national religion, national pride
were therefore uneasy and suspicious.</p>

<p>William of Orange, as unofficial leader of the English
opposition, kept in touch with all these malcontents, and possible
opponents of the government. At the same time he was careful to
keep on good terms with Charles and, when possible, with James,
always patiently, prudently, and with remarkable ability, steering
his course according to the wind, with one distant objective in
view.</p>

<p>He was popular with two sections of the subjects of Charles II,
with the Puritan element, the Nonconformists, in eclipse since
1660, who looked up to him as a possible David or Joshua (many of
these had made his acquaintance when in Holland, the asylum for
political and religious exiles), and with the stable, wealthy,
middle- and merchant-classes who believed that he represented law,
order, and common sense.</p>

<p>There seems to have been a feeling in England from 1672-1682
that, as both the King and his brother were without legitimate
heirs, affairs could remain very comfortably as they were until a
Protestant Princess and husband, desirable to the majority,
succeeded to the throne of their grandfather.</p>

<p>The bulk of the population were as comfortable as usual, and, as
usual, but little affected by politics, and cared little for the
minority who found good fishing in the corrupt waters of Whitehall,
and less for that other minority who, stealing to and from the
Hague, dreamed of and planned a future when the sons of Belial
should no longer flourish.</p>

<p>Three men of genius adorned English Art and Letters: Sir
Christopher Wren (1632-1723) was raising his baroque temple on the
site of the largest Gothic temple in Europe, and John Dryden
(1631-1700) was employing the ornate medium that he had made of
Shakespeare's English in gorgeous satires against the King's
enemies, while Samuel Butler (1612-1680), having written one of the
most famous of English burlesques, was dying in obscurity.</p>

<p>In Science there was Isaac Newton (1642-1727), still in
obscurity; in philosophy, John Locke (1632-1704), exiled with
Shaftesbury in the Hague where his "Letter on Toleration" is said
to have been read and pondered over by the Prince of Orange. The
ranks of the Puritans produced John Bunyan (1628-1688), whose
ingenuous exposition of his Faith has survived the theology it
exploited.</p>

<p>Despite the peculiar position of William in English politics,
despite the stream of English malcontents to the peaceful shelter
of the Hague or Leyden, the Dutch were the natural mercantile
rivals of the English, and far from popular with a nation who
smiled, spitefully, at the Laureate's "Ill-digested vomit of the
sea" taunt against the rivals of England.</p>

<p>The Lowlanders, intelligent, hardy, enterprising and
industrious, were a hundred years ahead of the rest of Europe in
all save the most luxurious and flamboyant of the Arts. In
commerce, colonisation, agriculture, crafts, science, economics,
they exercised an enormous influence; Dutch trade, Dutch business
organisations, Dutch banking, were ubiquitous&mdash;there was hardly a
department of civilisation from shipbuilding to watchmaking in
which the ingenuity and patience of the Netherlanders had not made
them pre-eminent.</p>

<p>In two naval wars they had proved themselves able to hold their
own with the successors of Drake and Raleigh; the sound of their
guns at Chatham had been a severe blow to English pride and
self-confidence.</p>

<p>It is probable that the bulk of the English people shared the
jealous dislike felt by the rest of Europe for the Republicans,
with their exasperating, complicated government, their freedom of
thought, their exceeding prosperity, their tireless industry, and
their plebeian respectability.</p>

<h3>THE DEATH OF CHARLES II</h3>

<p class="first">
ON the whole, England was satisfied with her condition, and on
the death of Charles II in 1685 his brother, though so unpopular,
ascended the throne without any demonstrations of public vexation.
William of Orange, who, imperious as he was, had done his utmost to
please one uncle, now resignedly but with good faith set himself to
please the other, with revived hope of detaching England from the
French Alliance. Louis XIV, at the Truce of Ratisbon, 1684, was at
the height of his power and glory, he was almost sure of the
Spanish Succession and had been confirmed in all his annexations
including Strassburg, Luxemburg, and Oudenarde.</p>

<p>The fribble Duke of Monmouth, who had been petted at the Hague
while he was the King's beloved, if disgraced, son, was quickly, if
honourably, dismissed, when he was the King's loathed and feared
nephew.</p>

<p>Three years before the huge enterprise of 1688, William had no
definite thought of armed interference with English affairs, but he
certainly looked forward either to the more or less passive
alliance of James, or to Mary's succession to the English crown,
when her elderly father should die without an heir. Immovable and
dauntless, he still pursued his steadfast designs against Louis
XIV, who seemed in such an impregnable position. But in 1686
William had balanced the Treaty of Ratisbon by the League of
Augsburg, the fourth coalition against the aggression of France,
masked as an agreement to maintain the Peace of Westphalia. The
signatories were Spain, the Empire, the States General, Sweden, and
Bavaria.</p>

<h3>THE MINISTERS</h3>

<p class="first">
WHO, precisely, were the men and what the events that cost James
II his Crown is not a question easy to answer in a small compass.
The short reign of the last of the Stewarts seems a record of pure
folly on the part of the King, and pure knavery on the part of his
advisers.</p>

<p>Whether James II was a dense zealot or, as in the case of Louis
XIV, a more fortunate but almost equally dull monarch, his desire
for power was bound up with enthusiasm for the true Faith, makes
little difference to a judgment on his actions as King of England.
Bigotry can never be interesting, and in persons occupying
positions of authority is inevitably disastrous.</p>

<p>James's conduct can only be described as obstinately stupid. He
took the oath&mdash;with mental reservations&mdash;as he wrote in apology to
Louis XIV. In other words, he was entirely untrustworthy and did
not mean to keep the vow sworn to the nation&mdash;through both the
Council and the Parliament&mdash;that he would maintain the
Constitution.</p>

<p>His first Parliament was Tory and submissive, voted him a life
revenue, and seemed not in the least disposed to pick a quarrel. A
crazy rebellion, headed by the trivial Monmouth, was easily
crushed; it only served to show that there were some English
rustics who had a simple faith in those fine abstractions,
religion, patriotism, a Cause, and to darken the King's name by the
severity of the reprisals he took on the misguided peasants who
fought as bravely at Sedgemoor as their forebears had fought at
Crcy and Agincourt.</p>

<p>James's cruelties have been no doubt exaggerated, and Lord
Jeffreys seems to have been a scapegoat for the sins of others, and
even for the barbarous customs of his times. Those who could pay
seem to have been pardoned. Still, the incredible sentences on
Alice Lisle and Elizabeth Gaunt, the village executions, the gangs
of chained prisoners, marching through London on their way to
slavery, while the Queen and her ladies pocketed their price, the
spectacular, if deserved, death of a romantic, pleasant young man,
were not details calculated to make any government popular with the
vulgar. Though all might have been lawful, it was harshly done, and
some magnanimity would have served the King's turn better.</p>

<p>James II ventured, however, on far more dangerous grounds when
he began to show a reckless preference for Roman Catholics that
warned the Protestant upper classes that not only were no coveted
posts and privileges coming to them in the future, but that they,
were likely to lose those that they had already received. Louis
XIV, with his usual obtuse vanity, concurred heartily in the scheme
to force a counter Reformation on England.</p>

<p>The Nonconformists joined with the Church of England in
resisting this threat of regal and religious tyranny, and went to
the length of denying themselves the toleration promised by the
first Declaration of Indulgence, 1687.</p>

<p>James II was not checked, however, even by the cold eye that
Pope Innocent XI turned on his efforts. Without humour, wit, or
understanding, without reflecting on his father's fate or the long,
shrewd, patient tactics of his brother, he made crude and violent
attacks on the privileges and property of the wealthy aristocracy
and middle-class, as well as provided them with ample excuses to
inflame the people, so easily roused by the cry of "No Popery!" Nor
had James any personal popularity on which to rely; he was
generally disliked, while his patron, Louis XIV, was making
blunders on a large scale that did not improve the prestige of
absolute or divine monarchy or Roman Catholicism in England.</p>

<p>The almost incredible stupidity of the Revocation of the Edict
of Nantes and the "Dragonnades" (1685) was followed by the second
hideous devastation of the Palatinate, as deliberately planned a
piece of murder, rapine, and robbery as the invasion of Holland in
1672. Nor had Louis any excuse for this barbarous action; the
systematic massacres and ruin of a non-hostile province merely
re-created a waste between Alsace and the frontiers of the
Empire.</p>

<p>These events made a great noise in Europe, and served as useful
propaganda for the Protestants (an enormous amount of pamphlets
survives to show the strength of feeling roused) while James's two
sensational acts of tyranny, the ejection of the Fellows of
Magdalen College, Oxford, for resisting a Roman Catholic President,
and the trial of the seven Bishops for sedition for their protest
against the second Declaration of Indulgence (1688) served the
powerful classes he had alarmed and offended as good pretexts for
taking means to check his encroachments.</p>

<p>The men who surrounded the infatuated King had been bred in the
Restoration school of politics and were nearly all unscrupulous
opportunists, without lofty aims or indeed any definite scheme of
government, but exceedingly able at keeping their places and making
profit out of them, though there was not one of them, save Halifax,
who had any ideas beyond the party politics.</p>

<p>Buckingham (1628-1687), the "man so various," after some years
of elegant idleness, died on his Yorkshire estates, the year of the
Revolution, almost forgotten, but by no means in "the worst inn's
worst room." Another able but unscrupulous politician, also twice a
victim of Dryden's vivid satire, Shaftesbury (1621-1683), who had
endeavoured by the Exclusion Bill to prevent the accession of
James, had fled disguised as a woman to Holland and had died in an
obscure lodging in Amsterdam. Arlington, a clever party intriguer
and an amiable courtier, connected by marriage with the House of
Nassau, had died in retirement in 1685.</p>

<p>There remained Godolphin (1645-1712), industrious, careful, with
an eye for the winning side; Danby (1631-1712), who had helped to
bring about the marriage of the Prince of Orange&mdash;a restless,
fashionable man of no great talents, completely unmoral, but an
adept at party chicanery; Sunderland, brilliant, insinuating, an
expert in every shade of intrigue and with an ironic disregard of
everything save his own advantage; the King's ineffective
brothers-in-law, Lawrence Hyde, Earl of Rochester, Henry Hyde, Earl
of Clarendon, the gloomy Nottingham, and one man of brilliant
understanding, philosophic outlook, honest intentions, and
honourable conduct, George Savile, Marquess of Halifax (1633-1695).
He delighted in the name of "Trimmer," asserting that the man who
sits in the middle of the boat prevents it from upsetting. He
failed to remark that unless the man who thus balances the craft
pulls his weight as well he fails to help its progress.
Fastidiousness and indifferentism, love of a sarcastic jest,
finally withdrew Halifax from government, if not from public life.
He died in opposition, his civilised ideals not having proved
acceptable to the factions in Parliament which had rendered it
impossible for him to remain in the service of a master whom he
much admired and to whom he might have been eminently useful.</p>

<p>Truly, politics was a dirty game in the seventeenth century, and
men with any delicacy who were not, like William III, vowed to a
distinct purpose, might be forgiven if they threw down the soiled,
marked cards and withdrew to meditation and leisure. "A man in a
corrupted age must make a secret of his integrity, or unless he
will be looked upon as a common enemy" (Halifax).</p>

<p>Halifax, however, was active enough in the business of 1688, and
the orderly revolution and the sane settlement are thought by some
historians to have the impression of his brilliant, civilised, and
dignified mind. But, obviously, Halifax could not by himself have
brought about an event so abrupt and complicated, and as far as the
success of the venture, which seems easy in retrospect, but was
exceedingly bold, hazardous, and difficult can be ascribed to any
Englishman it may be ascribed to Sunderland, who with consummate
address and brilliant knavery led James II gently on the path to
ruin. He was deepest in the counsels of the foolish King and not
only did he betray his secrets with steady skill, but he advised
him with unfaltering dexterity to take just those steps certain to
prove fatal.</p>

<p>Those who consider the Revolution of 1688 a happy turn in
English history should give some of the credit to Sunder-. land,
who must in their estimation have committed evil that good might
come. William of Orange, who had an excellent system of spies and
"intelligencers," received secret information of English affairs
from many sources, but nothing was more valuable to him than the
packets that reached him by the hands of Henry Sydney from the Earl
of Sunderland. The intermediary in this affair was the Countess,
who was supposed to be Sydney's mistress.</p>

<p>Sunderland had gone too far in his time-serving for these
valuable services to be duly rewarded; his reputation was too evil
for William III to venture to flout public opinion by employing or
rewarding him (though Titus Oates was pensioned), as he was able to
employ the respectable Whig nobility such as the Russells, and the
Cavendishes, and the Talbots.</p>

<p>William, however, who had little hope of meeting many men
honest, intelligent, and willing to serve him in England, and who
preferred brilliant knavery to dull, weak virtue, always kept
Sunderland in his regard and consulted him secretly when able.</p>

<p>The Earl had the art of making himself agreeable and necessary
to any type of master; he was able to seduce a Jesuit or a Dutch
Calvinist with equal ease. Other men, notable rather from their
rank and position than from their qualities, who decided to resist
and curb James with the help of his son-in-law, were Daniel French,
Earl of Nottingham, champion of the Church of England, Charles
Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, the King of Hearts, the Earl of
Devonshire, and Edward Russell, cousin of the Lord William Russell
whose execution, so finely described by Burnet, had given a martyr
to the Whigs.</p>

<p>There was a greater name than any of these signing the letter to
William that Dykvelt brought back with him to the Hague in 1687. It
was that of John Churchill (1650-1722), afterwards the Duke of
Marlborough, over whose character there have been so many
disputes.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be said that any special pleading has been able
to prove that John Churchill was in anything above the low standard
of his times. It cannot be denied that he had raised his fortunes
by accepting money from the kept woman of one King and by
acquiescing in his sister's being the kept woman of another, and
that, when the man who had been to him an easy master and had
trusted him blindly was on the verge of ruin, he completed a long,
secret treachery by an open desertion that was undoubtedly fatal to
the master whom he forsook.</p>

<p>It is useless to argue that Churchill risked the loss of
everything by his action&mdash;he had a high intelligence and he was
well informed. He must have known from the moment that he entered
into correspondence with William that the inept and blundering
James was doomed.</p>

<p>Nor is it possible to credit that he was inspired by lofty
ideals of his country's good and a sincere fervour for
Protestantism. Nothing in his life supports such a supposition, and
if he had had any sense of honour at all he would have protested
openly to James, not kept silent and betrayed him with deft
cunning. To excuse Churchill's behaviour, public and private, as
some endeavour to do, on the ground that he was only doing what
everyone else did, is to beg the question and to dismiss every code
of honour and decency as a mere triviality that a great man may
dispense with if he wishes.</p>

<p>Such were the men, all able, most of them unscrupulous,
all-powerful and most of them ambitious, who surrounded James
Stewart and kept in touch with William of Orange in 1687-1688.</p>

<h3>PREPARATION FOR REVOLUTION</h3>

<p class="first">
BY the beginning of 1688, William had tacitly agreed with his
English friends that he would, if necessary, interfere with English
affairs backed by sufficient power of ships and men to prevent
another failure like that of Monmouth.</p>

<p>There was a quarrel between James and William on the subject of
the British regiments in the pay of the United Provinces, which
Louis XIV eagerly fomented. The Bourbon was intriguing for the
possession of Cologne, which alarmed the Dutch with memories of
1672, and he financed James with half a million <i>livres</i> for
the equipment of a fleet with which to menace Holland from the
sea.</p>

<p>These continued aggressions on the part of Louis and this
compliance on the part of James drove William to take what must
have seemed to him a course so difficult as to be almost desperate.
Had he not had proof after proof of the intentions of Louis to
overwhelm Europe and of the way James would lean in a future war,
it is doubtful if he would have ventured all on an armed invasion
of England. His audacity equalled his prudence when he told Edward
Russell (May, 1688) that he would land in England if he were
invited by prominent men to do so.</p>

<p>The birth of the Prince of Wales, clumsily handled with silly
talk of a miracle, and the omission of Princess Anne,
representative of Mary's claims, and her own from the Queen's
bedside, were like a spark to tinder. Mary of Modena had never
borne a child who had survived, and this very opportune arrival of
a healthy male heir was too much for Protestant patience; they
refused to credit what they did not wish to believe.</p>

<p>The story was instantly spread that the child was the son of a
washerwoman, one Mary Grey, who had been slipped into the Queen's
bed in a warming-pan. This was a subject much to the taste of the
lampoonists, caricaturists, and pamphleteers and in the hands of
the astute enemies of James, a very powerful weapon against him,
providing coarse gibes at his personal honour as well as at his
political morality.</p>

<p>How many people really believed this tale, it is now impossible
to tell; it was probably swallowed by the ignorant and even by some
of the more intelligent. The unhappy child was well known all his
life to his opponents as the Pretender&mdash;i.e. the pretended Prince
of Wales, even when, as Mary of Scotland said of her son, events
proved him "too much his father's child."</p>

<p>Admiral Herbert, dismissed the service of James II, smuggled a
letter to William of Orange on June 30th, the day that the Bishops
were acquitted. Herbert was disguised as a "tarpaulin" or "tar" and
the letter that he carried was the guarantee that William had
demanded&mdash;a formal invitation signed by Devonshire, Danby, Lumley,
Compton, Bishop of London, Edward Russell, and Henry Sydney. These
gentlemen added to their invitation a protest against William's
recognition of the warming-pan impostor, upon which prayers for the
infant were stopped at the Prince's private chapel at the
Hague.</p>

<p>Whether William was convinced that the child's appearance was a
piece of impudent trickery or no, there is nothing to show. He
affected to believe it and he accepted the suggestion of his
English friends that he should make this supposititious heir his
excuse for invading England to maintain his wife's rights. By doing
this William took an irreparable step, for he must have realised
that James would never forgive his action. There was certainly
nothing in the character of James, private or public, to make him
exempt from suspicion&mdash;for instance, his behaviour to Anne Hyde
showed a very low, dishonest cunning, and his promise on his
accession was a deliberate lie&mdash;and both he and the Queen were
surrounded by Jesuits, who, rightly or wrongly, had a world-wide
reputation for intrigue and crafty double-dealing.</p>

<p>Whatever might have been the private opinion of William about
his uncle's child, no one can read the memoirs of the Princess of
Orange without being convinced that she at least was agonisingly
certain that her father was trying to cheat her out of her
birthright by a despicable and insolent imposture.</p>

<h3>MARY STEWART</h3>

<p class="first">
AT this juncture the character of William's wife becomes of
importance. She was at least the figurehead of the Protestants in
1688, for it was ostensibly to protect her interests that they
resolved on action, and she could at several points have completely
upset the gigantic plans of her imperious, bold, and wary
husband.</p>

<p>Since she had left Whitehall in 1678 the English girl had lived
a life that most of her fellow-countrywomen of rank would have
considered intolerably dull. The little Court at the Hague was
decorous, quiet, with a minimum of modest state and a minimum of
modest excitement.</p>

<p>Mary had no allowance from England and her means and
opportunities for pleasure were alike restricted. The atmosphere in
which she moved was one of sedate respectability and the religion
that most formed the spirit of the people was an austere Calvinism
that frowned upon everything likely to please and divert a girl
from the Whitehall of Charles II.</p>

<p>Mary Stewart, however, had been happy during those ten years of
peace and seclusion&mdash;"happier than I knew" she wrote afterwards in
a passion of nostalgia. She had two good reasons for her
felicity&mdash;her situation suited her character and she was
ecstatically in love with her husband.</p>

<p>Unambitious, domesticated, always in a low state of health,
often actually suffering, narrowly and sincerely religious,
good-natured, good-humoured, indolent and easy-going, the Princess
of Orange enjoyed the placid comfort of her husband's handsome and
stately houses, the orderly routine of her eventless life. She
liked her flowers, her music, her needlework, her friends, the
pleasant formalities of her little Court.</p>

<p>From the moment of her arrival at the Hague, the wilful,
hysterical girl had changed into the contented, modest, pious,
well-intentioned woman who fitted, like hand into glove, into Dutch
ways.</p>

<p>The charming placidity of her life was disturbed by a great joy
and a great sorrow, both of which shook her to her soul. The
outpourings she left behind, writings that were not meant for any
to see and that she intended to destroy, leave no doubt about the
poignant quality of her love for her husband. All she possessed of
passion, tenderness, loyalty, and enthusiasm was lavished on the
man whom she had so unwillingly married. She accepted him and all
he stood for with unquestioning fervour, to her he was "The
Protestant Hero" with <i>la cause commune</i> under his charge, and
she believed in him and admired him with a touching singleness of
mind. Her great grief was her childlessness, an ugly blot indeed on
her personal happiness, her relations with her husband, and her
dynastic importance.</p>

<p>Her intimate diaries show how this bitter misfortune preyed on
her mind, gnawed at her nerves and sent her into almost hysterical
ardours of resignation and submission to the dismal God in whom she
believed and whom she endeavoured to propitiate with endless
sermon-listening, prayers, and reading of gloomy and pious
tomes.</p>

<p>She was not very intelligent, she was almost wholly uneducated,
and her nature, made for simple gaiety and homely pleasures, was
tormented and warped by bigotry, but she was, in her sincerity,
courage, fidelity and sweetness, an admirable woman.</p>

<p>In person she was tall, majestic, inclined, even at twenty-six,
to stoutness, with a gentle, melancholy expression in her fine,
dark, weak eyes.</p>

<p>She has never received much attention from the romancists, but
there is more of genuine interest, sentiment, and passion in her
story than in that of any of the tawdry heroines of her uncle's
Court, whose shoddy intrigues have been so often raked over for
re-telling.</p>

<p>It was with considerable alarm and misgiving that the Princess
of Orange grasped the significance of the English crisis and her
husband's resolve to interfere in it. She sincerely detested the
thought of acting against her father, and was fully conscious of
the odium her unfilial behaviour would provoke. But her religion
and her love were powerfully on the other side and she did not
hesitate a second in giving her husband her complete allegiance.
She had no cause to love her father, who had never shown her any
affection, never paid her jointure, and who had tried by underhand
ways to wreck her marital happiness, and even to procure a divorce
between her and her husband, with some scheme of marrying her to
the Dauphin.</p>

<p>All that is clear about this obscure affair is that James was
employing agents in his daughter's household to make mischief on
the subject of Elizabeth Villiers, who was reputed by the gossips
to be William's mistress. This has never been proved, but scandal
seethed in the austere little Court and but for William's sharp
dismissal of the talebearers and Mary's complete acquiescence in
his action, there might have been an open rupture that would have
prevented the close union of husband and wife, so essential in
1688.</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange had told Temple when he was looking for a
wife that as he was likely enough to have trouble abroad all his
life he could not endure it at home, and at this crisis of his
affairs he found indeed what he had wished&mdash;a woman who, far from
making trouble, warmly forwarded his slightest wish, and who wrote
in her diary: "God pardon me this love if it be idolatry," and "If
I cannot have a child by this man, I would not have one by an
angel."</p>

<p>There was much of honour in Mary's steadfast loyalty to her God
and her love, and an artless sincerity, that has something of
idealism, in her motives and her conduct.</p>

<h3>THE REVOLUTION</h3>

<p class="first">
THUS supported by the unswerving devotion of his wife, William
of Orange made his preparations with tact and complete
self-control. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that he made no
mistakes and his opponents made nothing but mistakes.</p>

<p>In spite of Republican and French influence in the United
Provinces, he obtained the consent of the States General to his
enterprise. In spite of the religion of James, he obtained the
tacit consent of the Emperor, the King of Spain, and the Pope; they
would, in their fear of Louis XIV, at least "look through their
fingers" at the curbing or dethroning of James.</p>

<p>Louis XIV, with his eye on the Spanish succession and a
consequent war with the Emperor, who was then facing a Turkish
attack on Belgrade, blundered badly in neglecting English affairs
while he endeavoured to strengthen his frontiers on the Rhine, was
stupid in prolonging his quarrel with Innocent XI, by forcing his
own nominee, Cardinal Furstenberg, into Cologne, and by
exasperating the Dutch with his refusal to reduce the severe
customs on their goods.</p>

<p>By September, Louis had insulted the Pope by seizing Avignon,
and relieved William of the fear of a possible invasion of the
United Provinces by sending his troops into Germany.</p>

<p>When James, who had haughtily refused French help and warnings,
and who was busily preparing a packed Parliament, was at last
roused to his danger, he stationed the Navy under Dartmouth at
Chatham, called up the local garrisons to London, brought Scotch
and Irish regiments to England, thus mustering 46,000 troops. The
alarmed King also made concessions, restoring the charters to
London and other cities and putting dismissed malcontents back in
their places; he even reinstated the expelled Fellows of
Magdalen.</p>

<p>No one was impressed by these actions, which were put down
rather to panic than to good faith. Nor did he have any better
success in Holland where he declared his willingness to uphold the
Treaty of Nijmegen and to join with the Dutch against the French.
This merely offended Louis without winning the Dutch, who suspected
a trick.</p>

<p>William of Orange, long delayed by "Papist," i.e. west winds,
sailed from Helvoetsluis on October 19th. This news reduced James
to the degrading step of proving before the Privy Council that the
Prince of Wales was indeed his son, an action over which even his
own daughter, Anne, "made very merry."</p>

<p>A sudden gale sent William's ships back to port, but with few
losses, and he sailed again on November 1st, and made for
Yorkshire, where Lord Danby was awaiting him. It was necessary,
however, to avoid Dartmouth as he lay off Harwich, and favoured by
changes of wind, William veered to the west, and avoiding the
English Fleet which followed in pursuit, gained Torbay, where the
splendid fleet anchored, after the pilot had nearly missed the
entry to the bay.</p>

<p>So hazardous was this enterprise, so easily might the English
Fleet have forced an action on the Dutch&mdash;and a victory would have
been as fatal to William as a defeat&mdash;by such a mere chance was it
successful, and the disaster for himself and his country would have
been complete had it failed, that some naval experts have
considered that William scarcely realised what he was risking and
how little hope he had of success. This can hardly be accepted; it
seems more reasonable to suppose that William's intense earnestness
of purpose, his long and deeply cherished hopes and schemes joined
to his utter fearlessness, gave him that audacity which might be
termed foolhardiness were it not backed by every possible
precaution and care. The spirit that directed the fleet in 1688 was
the spirit that had defied the French in 1672&mdash;a kind of fatalism
that comes from exaltation of spirit&mdash;as Buckingham wrote from the
camp at Utrecht, "the Prince was lifted up."</p>

<p>William of Orange was not received with enthusiasm in England;
the people of the West, remembering Jeffreys, were apathetic or
afraid, they watched curiously while his magnificent army of Dutch
and mercenaries floundered over the rough, broken roads, but made
no effort to rally to the standard on which was inscribed: "I will
maintain the Protestant religion and the liberties of England," and
that was adorned with the billets and Lion of Nassau.</p>

<p>When the invading Prince made his headquarters at Exeter and
attended the service in the Cathedral, the Dean and Chapter left
the building, and Burnet, who had accompanied the expedition, had
to preach the sermon. William was deeply disappointed, but,
"stately, serious, and reserved" as Evelyn noted him, kept his
temper and bided his chance.</p>

<p>James vacillated miserably; he was elderly, in poor health,
bewildered, harassed&mdash;the touchstone of a crisis showed his total
lack of ability, and even of common sense. He gathered his troops
at Salisbury to check William's advance, but by the time that he
had made up his mind to join them, the gentlemen of the West and
several nobles, Delamere, Cornbury, Seymour, were joining William,
and Danby had seized York. Thus strengthened, the Prince
advanced.</p>

<p>James had appointed a Frenchman, Louis de Duras, Earl of
Faversham, a nephew of Turenne and the unpopular victor of
Sedgemoor, his commander-in-chief, and refused even at this
juncture to call a Parliament. This caused profound discontent
among his officers, and the night of November 24th, Churchill and
the Duke of Grafton, Charles II's rakehelly son, went over to
William's headquarters.</p>

<p>This treacherous desertion completed James's abject confusion of
mind; he returned to London to learn that his daughter Anne, her
husband, and the Bishop of London had also forsaken him. From the
Navy and from the provinces came tales of disaffection, and the
forlorn King hastily called a meeting of fifty Peers, who in harsh
terms demanded concessions that merely frightened him into a deeper
terror.</p>

<p>With native duplicity, however, he feigned acceptance of their
distasteful advice and appointed Halifax, Nottingham, and Godolphin
to treat with William. This, however, as he confided to Louis's
Ambassador, Barillon, was a mere trick to gain time.</p>

<p>James had no intention of coming to terms with William, and,
with his usual recklessness, thought nothing of the offence he was
giving three of his most powerful nobles. While the three
commissioners were on their fool's errand the King smuggled his
wife and son out of the kingdom and prepared to follow them.</p>

<p>Stealing out of Whitehall at night he fled to Faversham and
boarded a vessel bound for France. When Halifax and his colleagues
returned to Whitehall with lenient and reasonable terms from
William, they found the country without a government, the King
fled, a letter sent to Faversham disbanding the army, and the mob
(the word from "mobile" was just in fashion), encouraged by the
usual political agitators and rejoicing in the suspension of law
and order, attacking the houses of Roman Catholics (December 11th
and 12th).</p>

<p>The vagrant humours of the rioters were lashed to fury by
persistent tales (perhaps spread by the Protestants) that the "wild
Irish" brought over by James were advancing on London and
massacring all in their way, and by the exciting chases after
priests and "Jesuits," who were trying to escape in disguise.</p>

<p>Among those captured was a prize in the person of Lord Jeffreys,
who had to be sent to the Tower to save him from being "de witted,"
as the cant phrase ran.</p>

<p>Seeing the capital bordering on anarchy, the Peers asked William
to come to London and restore order. An invitation, which the
Prince found far more gratifying, came from the City of London; he
was changing all his plans to accede to this appeal, which he
regarded as of deep importance, when the course of events was
altered by the re-appearance of James on the scene. Captured at
Sheerness in mistake for a Jesuit, he was released by the Peers and
returned to London (December 15th) where he was received with an
odd display of loyalty and affection from the excited and fickle
people.</p>

<p>William, however, now sure of himself and relying on the support
of the City, refused to treat with the man who had tricked him
once, and behaved with a sudden harshness that was, under the
circumstances, daring, deliberately incurring odium, which he had
hitherto wished to avoid. But he acted on his discovery of James's
cowardice and untrustworthiness.</p>

<p>The Prince arrested Faversham, sent by James to ask an
interview, on the excuse that he had illegally disbanded the army,
and sent Halifax with two other Lords to the King, ordering him to
quit London for Ham, near Petersham, Surrey.</p>

<p>The famous Dutch, or Blue Guards, under the Graf von Solms,
displaced the veteran Lord Craven and his men at the palace, and
James submitted with incredible meekness to the incredible insult.
Refusing Ham as too damp, he said he would go to Rochester and left
London on December 17th. The same day William of Orange entered the
capital, incurring some unpopularity by going to St. James's Palace
by a route that avoided the shouting crowds whom he so utterly
despised, and who were waiting to welcome him with oranges on
sticks. It is to be supposed that they were not the same people as
those who lit the bonfires for James a few days ago.</p>

<p>Even then James might have maintained a party, and though he
might not have been able to secure much for himself, he could have
made the situation difficult, if not impossible, for William.</p>

<p>Clarendon, his brother-in-law, and others tried in vain to
dissuade him from the obvious folly of flight, but James was
finished as a King and as a man. He found no courage either in the
fanaticism of his Jesuits, or in the superstition of the divine
right of Kings, and escaping from the gates William had carefully
left unguarded, left Rochester Castle on December 23rd, and taking
a vessel in the Thames, sailed to France, reaching Ambleteuse on
Christmas Day.</p>

<p>This situation did not find William of Orange at a loss. He
defied France immediately by ordering Barillon to leave the kingdom
in forty-eight hours&mdash;an action that must have given him keen
personal satisfaction&mdash;and he convened the magistrates and Common
Councillors of London and all the members of Charles II's Commons
to meet on December 26th. James's Parliament was ignored on the
grounds of corruption.</p>

<p>This curious body, the Convention, gravely accepted its task,
that of giving a semblance of law and order to a state of affairs
really dangerous and unstable, and invited William to administer
the country and to issue writs for a Parliament, i.e., some
gathering representative of public opinion.</p>

<p>William showed himself prudent and skilful in conducting this
difficult affair, both in preventing disorders in England and in
conducting international affairs. In the delicate matter of
soothing the jealous pride of the English Army, William was ably
seconded by the tact and skill of Churchill and by the influence of
Grafton, also by the discreet conduct of the Dutch and mercenary
troops, against whose behaviour, under trying circumstances, no
complaint was heard.</p>

<p>The invader's aloof attitude during the election impressed a
people used to all methods of corruption, and the Convention, when
it met, could fairly be said to have been elected freely by the
people without any kind of pressure or bribery.</p>

<p>Indeed, so easy and comfortable was the Convention with an
expert running the country for them that it split into factions,
who took up with zest party differences and local squabbles.</p>

<p>The Whigs were exultant and in the majority, the Tories divided
and in the minority. Vexatious general questions such as the divine
right of Kings, the position of the Church, how far James had
abdicated by his flight, whether the "warming-pan" baby should be
acknowledged were mixed up with the personal questions that
influenced each member and coloured by the failure of one set of
opinions and the triumph of another.</p>

<p>The leading mind seems to have been that of Halifax, who had
been moved in William's favour on a closer acquaintance with him,
and who was disgusted with the behaviour of James and personally
irked by the mock embassy of Hungerford.</p>

<p>A Regency was suggested&mdash;then, that it should be assumed that
the throne was vacant&mdash;then, that Mary should be Queen, William,
though a grandson of Charles I, stood after his wife and her sister
Anne with regard to the Crown of England. The party for the
Princess of Orange, headed by Danby, fell to pieces, however, on an
indignant letter from Mary in which she refused to put forward any
claims against those of her husband.</p>

<p>Anne, influenced by the Churchills, who were playing a waiting
game, also waived her rights, which she would have had much
difficulty in enforcing. The Lords clung to the principle of
hereditary right, the Commons to that of the people's power of
election.</p>

<p>While matters were at this deadlock, brought about not only by
warring interests, but by a sincere attempt to reconcile expediency
with tradition, William, impatient under an outward serenity (he
had been three months in England waiting on events), called
together a few Peers and told them his mind. He was, as he once
said of himself, "a plain man who did not like whipped cream" and
his remarks were extremely to the point. He would neither be a
Regent nor a Prince Consort, "holding the throne by an
apron-string"; the English had an absolute right to elect their
King&mdash;if he were not chosen he would return to Holland, where his
own country needed him.</p>

<p>This put the Parliament in a dilemma&mdash;they did not know "what to
do with the Prince or what to do without him." He alone was
administering the country, and it must have been patent to all that
he was doing it with great ability, dignity, and self-control. His
withdrawal with his orderly, well-trained troops would mean chaos
and trouble at least with the Dissenters, moderate men, and the
City. James, having defaulted and taken his heir out of the
country, even the most extreme Tories were without a candidate.</p>

<p>Scruples and differences were sunk, if not for the public good,
at least because the sound sense of Parliament saw that a
settlement was necessary.</p>

<p>On February 12th, the Princess of Orange arrived in the Thames;
her first private meeting with her husband provoked bitter tears on
each side&mdash;hysteria lay close under the surface of William's
haughty calm and Mary's pious gaiety. On the next day the Crown of
England was offered by Halifax as Speaker of the House of Lords to
William and his wife in the banqueting-room at Whitehall, and they
were immediately proclaimed in London as William III and Mary II,
the Princess having been elected Queen regnant&mdash;i.e., as joint
sovereign with her husband, though the administration was to rest
with the King.</p>

<p>"I saw Marc Antony offer him a crown&mdash;and yet it was not a crown
either." Certainly, the crown that William received was not that
which James had cast away or that which he, autocratic as any of
the Stewarts, would have liked to wear. Parliament, in a pious
desire to "secure our religion, laws, and liberties," had tacked "a
declaration of right" to the magnificent gift. In other words, the
victors&mdash;the powerful, wealthy, middle- and upper-classes&mdash;in the
struggle imposed terms on the loser&mdash;the King&mdash;any King. It was
ironic that William "The Deliverer" should be penalised for the
sins of the man whom he had driven away, but Parliament was
thinking of the future, and the fact that constitutional monarchy
has endured so long with no notable upheavals seems to prove that
they acted wisely, though there are many who passionately deplore
the re-arrangement of 1689 as being the end of all that was fine
and desirable in English government&mdash;a disaster and a disgrace,
where the new money-made class overturned the ancient nobility and
the true King for purely selfish motives.</p>

<p>Most of the provisos of the Declaration of Rights had a basis of
common sense; the King was not to levy taxes, to suspend the laws,
to keep an army in time of peace, to exercise the dispensing power,
while Parliaments were to be held frequently. Such was the first
rough draft of the terms that William, no doubt with inner chagrin,
accepted. They were afterwards expanded and confirmed in the Bill
of Rights, December 16th, 1689, Triennial Bill, December 22nd,
1694, Act of Settlement, June 12th, 1701. Further important
measures, which curbed the power of the Crown, were the Mutiny Bill
(1689) which prevented the keeping of troops without the annual
assent of Parliament, and the new East India Act, which transferred
the granting of trade monopolies from the Crown to the people,
i.e., the traders and the wealthy class.</p>

<h3>RESULTS OF THE REVOLUTION</h3>

<p class="first">
MOST of the men concerned in bringing about the Revolution found
their count in it; honours, titles, appointments, opportunities,
were lavished on all the politicians who had manoeuvred James out
and William in, Roman Catholics were penalised, Dissenters left in
a comfortable obscurity, Jacobites abandoned to the combining of
forlorn hopes in exile, Scotland was brought into the English
Settlement, much against the will of a minority; Ireland, after a
pitiful resistance, was subdued for another hundred years; the
Church of England, the Protestant upper classes, the City, the
traders, the shopkeepers, all were more or less satisfied with an
arrangement that left them with a feeling of security against those
ancient bugbears, a monarch playing at absolutism, unexpected
taxation, a large standing army, the French and the Pope, and that
had secured them the power of making money without fear of the
monarch's avarice or stupidity.</p>

<p>No doubt the daily life and prosperity of the mass of the people
were not very different under William from what they had been under
James or Charles, and there were very many who were ruined by the
change of kings, but there does seem to have been a general feeling
of satisfaction at the exit of the Stewarts and the Papists and the
clipping of regal powers.</p>

<p>Louis XIV, having inevitably but disastrously espoused the lost
cause of James II, England was involved in two long wars with
France (1689&mdash;Treaty of Ryswyck, 1697, Treaty of Utrecht, 1713),
but even these, expensive as they were, were not wholly unpopular,
raising the national prestige against an hereditary foe as they
did, and giving so many people the opportunity of making money and
acquiring fame.</p>

<p>Less spectacular than the showy, bloody campaigns in Flanders,
but as important even as the later victories of Marlborough, were
the English command of the Channel and gradual naval supremacy,
emphasised by a gratifying victory over the gorgeous ships of
France at La Hogue (March 19th, 1692), the outcome of William III's
belief that England must, to hold her own in Europe, be a maritime
power.</p>

<p>The foundation of the Bank of England and the formation of the
National Debt immensely helped the wealth and reputation of
England, and the scheme whereby the people, instead of being
arbitrarily taxed, were paid interest on money lent to the
government, proved exceedingly popular.</p>

<p>The national comfort was added to by the re-coinage (1696), a
better maintenance of law and order, a more general, though very
imperfect, toleration of various Christian opinions, and by less
open jobbery, bribery, and corruption. However amusing the open
Court held by the Stewarts may have been to Londoners, many of whom
made handsome incomes out of it, the decorum of William and the
virtue of Mary were more to the liking of the country as a whole
and the majority of the people did feel easier when the loose woman
and the pimp, the jobber and the harpy, had fled with the King and
the Jesuits across the water.</p>

<p>A substantial benefit, directly due to William III but not put
into practice until after his death, was the Union with
Scotland.</p>

<p>In brief, the Settlement of 1689, the results of the new
constitution and of the domestic and foreign policy of William III
(advisers he scarcely had, even at home, and he was always his own
foreign minister), together with the growing wealth, trade, and
power of the people, partly due to colonial expansion, laid the
foundations of the British Empire, British might, prestige, and
dominion, which reached their apogee two hundred years later in the
reign of Victoria.</p>

<h3>THE KING STADTHOLDER</h3>

<p class="first">
WILLIAM OF ORANGE, the man who had risked most and striven
hardest in the crisis of 1688, received his reward, the
gratification of combining a huge coalition with England against
Louis XIV. "He has such a mind to France," noted Halifax, "that one
would think he had only taken England in the way."</p>

<p>On the whole, his newly-acquired kingdom stood by him, voting
him more money than had ever been granted to the Stewarts, and
following his foreign policy, so that on his death-bed he had the
satisfaction of knowing that his work would be carried on, though
another would reap that glory and those rewards for which he had
cared very little. William III and Marlborough had different
conceptions of success and each in a measure achieved that which he
had so early set out to obtain.</p>

<p>William's achievement in arming England against his own bitter
foe was not, however, without a price, which he at times found
almost intolerable. Twice the factions, ingratitude, suspicion, and
rudeness of the English Commons broke his constancy, which so
impressed and exasperated his <i>new</i> subjects, to the point of
resignation of the Crown, and in the forced revocation of the Irish
grants and in the dismissal of the Dutch Guards the King tasted the
bitterest humiliation.</p>

<p>Much has been made of his unpopularity&mdash;even his admirers have
heightened this for the sake of dramatic effect. It is supposed to
have rested on his reserve, the removal of the Court from
Whitehall, foreign favourites, and his anxiety to escape from
England. All this has probably been exaggerated&mdash;the lack of a
Court, for instance, could have vexed only a few people in the
capital, and if some enjoyed the antics of the demireps who
gathered about the Stewarts, there were plenty of another temper
who were ready to admire respectability&mdash;Queen Mary made goodness
fashionable and undoubtedly pleased a great number of people. The
whole feeling of the country was for stability, law, and order.</p>

<p>Nor is William's quiet life likely to have offended any save
those hangers-on of royal extravagances who were losers by it; the
constantly repeated anecdotes of his brusque dryness or rudeness
seem to derive from Burnet, snubbed by William, who disliked him as
a busybody, and from the silly slanders of the vulgar Duchess of
Marlborough.</p>

<p>There is abundant, though seldom quoted, evidence to the effect
that William III was of fine manners on both public and private
occasions&mdash;one of the most striking witnesses to this is M.
Tallard, Louis XIV's envoy, who came to England full of prejudice
against William, who was his opponent throughout their intercourse,
and who was reporting to Louis XIV William's speeches to his
Parliament and his behaviour during his campaigns&mdash;for instance,
Dr. Hutton's account of the King's conduct in Ireland shows that
both William's courtesy and his temper were equal to a very
considerable strain. Most probably it might be said of William as
Dr. Johnson, Jacobite as he was, said of George III, "Sir, I take
him to be as fine a gentleman as one may suppose Louis XIV or
Charles II to have been." The Spencer house journals, Halifax's
careful notes of his conversations with the King, which had not
been discovered when Lord Macaulay wrote his famous account of
William III, prove that William was largely his own minister during
the short period that Halifax was nominally in office, 1689-1690.
They also show that William was by no means reserved or even
serene, save in public. He expressed himself vehemently to Halifax,
who observed him with a shrewd detached admiration.</p>

<p>"The Commons," the King declared, "had used him like a dog" and
"their coarse usage so boiled upon his stomach that he had to break
out." He declared passionately that he had not come over to
establish a republic, and that he would not be King Log. His
expressions about his wife's uncles, Hyde and Clarendon, shocked
Halifax, who was besides astonished at the King's thirst for action
against the French.</p>

<p>When, in June, 1689, William exclaimed: "We shall never be quiet
until we have a brush for it!" the philosophic Englishman noted:
"Great men love to come to a decision as soon as they can, courage
being apt to presume on good fortune."</p>

<p>In these conversations with the only English minister that was
ever absolutely faithful to him, the King repeated so often that he
was a "Trimmer" that even Halifax remarked that a good reason might
be destroyed by too much pressing upon it.</p>

<p>There was no special grievance against William for his
employment of foreigners; men like Bentinck, Ginkel, Solms, and
Oberkirk, were of complete integrity, and obviously worth what the
nation paid them, nor did they interfere with the privileges of the
natives.</p>

<p>A search through the lists of William's household shows that he
had very few Dutch in his English establishments. A fuss was made
over the Irish grants, which were as nothing compared to the gifts
of the Stewarts to their favourites. Ginkel, at least, quite
deserved the reward so ungraciously revoked. William was certainly
not regarded with enthusiasm by the English, he was essentially
moderate and tolerant, and thereby disappointed all, but it seems
clear that he was respected and even admired by the bulk of the
nation, who, however the intrigues at Whitehall might veer, had no
desire for a return of the Stewarts. After some delays the
Parliament voted 600,000 of the 686,000 demanded by the States
General for the expedition of 1688. The Commons were, at least,
willing to pay cash for 1688.</p>

<p>In the army William was very popular, and he became a hero and a
symbol to the Protestants and Scotland and Ireland; after the fall
of Namur, 1695, after the Assassination Plot, 1696, the recognition
of James III by Louis XIV, 1700, he was a hero and a symbol even to
England.</p>

<p>On the whole, he suited the event, the period, the trend of
thought, very well; to a vast number of plain people he was what
Matthew Prior, laughing at the vanity of Louis and the flattery of
Boileau, named him&mdash;a sensible, businesslike person with an
admirable courage, even for those warlike times.</p>

<p>The King's side of the question was not so pleasant; his
position was profoundly difficult, and he was in exile from a
country passionately beloved: "It is Kermesse at the Hague," he
told Huggens, his secretary, one May morning, "Oh, for the wings of
a bird to be there!"</p>

<p>His health failed rapidly from his coming to England, and he was
vexed to the heart by what seemed to him petty party squabbles,
which hindered a great design. He found it maddeningly difficult to
find anyone trustworthy to serve him: "There are honest men in
England, but they are not among my friends," he remarked.</p>

<p>He was surrounded by jobbers, place-seekers, traitors, men with
a foot in each camp, time-servers waiting for him to die,
indifferent opportunists.</p>

<p>The honest Halifax went into opposition, the honest Temple into
retirement, clever rogues like Sunderland, intelligent, upright men
like Carstairs and Patterson had to be consulted in secret, lofty
characters like John Locke refused office, valuable public servants
like Sir John Dalrymple were lost through local scandals arising
from family quarrels.</p>

<p>The King's one loyal minister was the Queen; her correspondence
with him when she was governing during his absences reveals a state
of domestic affairs so desperate as to be almost incredible.
Indeed, in this reign, which appears in retrospect so orderly and
established, it was often touch and go that another revolution did
not bring James back or establish a republic.</p>

<p>William himself doubted if it could be done, Mary was in
despair; plots, treachery, threat of invasion, mutiny, revolt, the
ghastly problems of Ireland and Scotland, the insubordination of
Anne and her bear-leaders, the Marl-boroughs, combined to make the
post-revolution period one of almost chaotic excitement and
alarm.</p>

<p>However he might be regarded in England, William's exploit
dazzled at a distance, his prestige rose greatly in Europe. In
France he was a monster, but one of almost legendary powers. Even a
man of the lofty intelligence of La Bruyre could write of him as
"cet homme ple et livide" who had driven his father and mother
<i>(sic)</i> into exile and overturned a whole country to gratify a
demoniac ambition. This long diatribe against the enemy of France
includes the tale that William had in infancy bitten his nurse to
death.</p>

<p>Yet all this malice was based on admiration, and to the French
William appeared a greater man than he did to the English, who
took&mdash;so absorbed were they in their own affairs&mdash;very much for
granted the expedition that astounded Europe.</p>

<p>Thus, extravagantly maligned and hated by some, extravagantly
lauded by others, misunderstood by many, by others merely
tolerated, amid a turmoil of stress of business, politics and war,
with neither rest nor pleasure did William III, constant to his own
ideals, pass the thirteen years of his reign. He had accepted the
"great mind's great bribe," the chance of carrying a large,
difficult, and dangerous enterprise, and probably, even in the
years of his deepest disgust and suffering, he was glad that he had
not refused the dazzling opportunity that had come his way in
1688.</p>

<p>Historians have frequently blamed him because he never became a
"true-born Englishman" and always retained a passionate affection
for his own country. It would have been difficult for a man of
thirty-eight, peculiarly patriotic, and extremely national in his
taste, to have suddenly become so enthusiastic for another country
as to be able to convince the natives that he was one of
themselves.</p>

<p>If his lack of identification with his mother's people was
resented by the English, he on his side found much to condemn, from
the dirt of Whitehall to the running of the public services in
England.</p>

<p>The Netherlands were then in much ahead of Europe, and England
benefited by the Dutch tastes, crafts, and inventions, which
through William's encouragement were introduced. What was more
important than whether he liked the English or whether they liked
him was that even his enemies admitted that never did he betray
English interests or set them second to those of his own
country.</p>

<p>The Princess of Orange reigned five years, during which time she
was profoundly agitated, uneasy, and unhappy. She disliked her
position, she was wretchedly homesick for Holland, she was
tormented by the constant absences of her husband and the tumult of
affairs. She felt very keenly the odium attaching to her occupation
of her father's throne, and she was painfully sensitive to the
treachery, ill-will, and intrigue that surrounded her and her
husband.</p>

<p>These troubles and constant ill-health reduced her to such a
morbid condition that she not only prepared herself to die, but
almost willed herself to do so. When at the head of affairs she
showed good sense and courage and her brief rule was not marred by
any ill-behaviour or ugly act.</p>

<p>It is easy to smile at her narrow bigotry, her gloomy piety, her
intense belief in the righteousness of her cause, but her simple,
untrained mind was faithful to the creed it had been taught&mdash;she
"satisfied her God."</p>

<p>Her sudden death at the age of thirty-two years was dismal and
pathetic in every detail from the moment she shut herself in her
closet to burn her papers to that when her husband, at the limit of
his nerves and almost crazy with anguish, fled to Richmond from
Kensington Palace to escape the sound of the hammering as the black
hangings were put in place.</p>

<p>The charge that Mary was neglected by her husband has been often
repeated. The sole authority seems to be Burnet, in Mary's own most
intimate writings there is not a shadow of complaint; none of
William's letters to her survive.</p>

<p>Whether Elizabeth Villiers was his mistress or no will probably
never be discovered; whatever the affair, it was conducted with
secrecy and decorum, and Mary, at worst, might consider herself
fortunate among the princesses of Europe in having only one
rival.</p>

<p>William's behaviour at his wife's death shows that her
passionate affection was returned and it seems unfair to assume
that his agonies were remorse, or that, because we know so little
of his relations with his wife, these were, on his side, ungrateful
or unkind.</p>

<p>Mary's blameless life and orthodox piety made her almost a saint
among Protestant divines, but her father refused to permit mourning
to be worn for her and a Jacobite in his zeal preached on the
occasion of her death a sermon on the text: "Go bury her, for she
is a king's daughter."</p>

<h3>THE EXILED KING</h3>

<p class="first">
EXCEPT for a short period of discomfort in Ireland, King James
passed the remainder of his days easily enough. Louis XIV found him
tiresome and costly, but treated him with lavish generosity,
thereby laying up a burden for his descendants until the day when
Louis XV washed his hands of the heritage, saying of the Stewarts:
"It is an unfortunate family of which I wish to hear no more."</p>

<p>James suffered much mental anguish, no doubt, but he was
continually buoyed up with hopes of a return to his throne; he was
surrounded by adherents and flatterers, his circumstances were
luxurious, he had the praises of a devoted wife and the blessings
of priests to sustain him. If he was indeed sincerely pious he must
have been much gratified with the illusion that he had cast away an
earthly for a heavenly crown. His last religious fits were not
without a suspicion of senility&mdash;a weak mind finally overturned by
bigotry, but there are those who find a mystical quality in his
repentance and resignation.</p>

<p>A daughter, who became a nun, was born to him and Maria d'Este
in exile, there never was any "warming-pan" tale about her arrival,
a fact which goes far to remove any stigma from her brother's
birth.</p>

<p>From the exile of James II may be dated the remarkable cult
known as the White Rose or Stewart "Romaunt." Sensitive and
romantic people have seen something so affecting in the misfortunes
of this Royal House that they have built up from one generation to
another, a loyalty, a veneration, an enthusiasm that often blend
into an obsession.</p>

<p>It was, for instance, recently asserted that the body of Lord
Derwentwater (executed 1716) was able to work miracles, and that
when alive he had the power to cure the King's Evil&mdash;this by virtue
of his mother's being the bastard daughter of Charles II. A faith
in the divine right of Kings, so touching and so steadfast, has
been able to invest the Stewarts with a cloud of tradition, legend,
fiction and poetry, through which it is almost impossible to
discern the truth. Inspired by these admirable sentiments, the
Scots who had persistently murdered or thrown out the Stewarts when
they ruled in their native country, twice rose to support the
claims of the son and grandson of James II.</p>

<p>They received a cold reward for their enthusiasm, for the vast
bulk of the common sense of the nation was against them, and
balladry and "glamour" apart, neither James nor the Chevalier de
Saint George, nor his son, gave any signs of being a better
candidate for kingship than any of their forebears who had so
signally failed in that difficult profession.</p>

<h3>THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE REVOLUTION</h3>

<p class="first">
JOHN LOCKE is named the apostle of common sense and of the
Revolution of 1688. His two "Treatises of Civil Government" are the
apologia of that settlement&mdash;the new contract between King and
people implied in the Bill of Rights, just as "The Leviathan" of
Hobbes was an apologia for absolute monarchy, though not for
monarchy by Divine Right.</p>

<p>John Locke's argument, which has, on the whole, held good until
the present day in this country, was that any monarchy must depend
on an agreement between King and people, that an infringement of
that agreement on the part of the sovereign returned the right of
freedom in another choice of ruler to the people.</p>

<p>This is obviously only an abstraction, like the Divine Right
theory, since a contract is not necessarily implied in any form of
government that may evolve from something that has no business
basis. But it was a practical, sensible ideal, which sounded stable
and convenient, and satisfied even liberal thinkers until the wide
movement of a hundred years later, which began with the theories of
J. J. Rousseau, to do away with kings altogether and to make the
people rulers themselves, under the majestic but delusive plea
"that man was born free."</p>

<p>This fallacy ended in excesses of insanity like the French
Revolution, and proved to be as unworkable as the Divine idea of
kingship&mdash;perhaps more so, since it is easier to invest some power
in one man than to divide it equally among millions, and it is no
more inconvenient to assume that God inspires the ruler than to
assert that He is behind the mob.</p>

<p>It might, perhaps, with some reason, be argued that the limited
contractual monarchy as achieved by the Bill of Rights and as
expounded by John Locke, was among the most workable, sanest
schemes of government that practical men ever put together for the
protection of law and property and the safeguarding of the
financial interests of a nation.</p>

<p>Whatever self-interest lay behind the movement, and whether the
oligarchy of the wealthy trading classes that followed was a better
form of government than absolute monarchy or no, the orderly and
dignified externals of the Revolution of 1688 could claim to be
adorned with dicta of popular liberal patriotism, as expressed by
Algernon Sidney: "It is not upon the uncertain will and
understanding of a Prince that the safety of a nation ought to
depend...for this reason the Law is established which no passion
can disturb."</p>

<p>The fallacies of this statement are obvious; since an oligarchy
or any representatives of the people or the people themselves are
likely also to be of "uncertain will and understanding." And who is
so above fault as to be able to establish a law that shall be
impeccable and impregnable? But the men who brought about the
Revolution of 1688 saw no flaws in such plausible statements as are
never wanting to gloss the opportunism of shrewd worldly men.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>3. THE ART OF FLATTERY</h2>

<p class="first">
FLATTERY is, of course, a very vast subject and one cannot hope
to do more in this brief discussion than call attention to a few
aspects of flattery when it had ceased to be an instinct of fear
and love mingled and become an art used for many devious ends.</p>

<p>As civilisation advanced, people began to discover that more was
to be gained by flattery than by force&mdash;and that flattery had a
larger purchasing power than coin of the realm.</p>

<p>It has been used to sway individuals and to influence crowds, it
has generally been the keenest weapon in the armoury of the rogue
and adventurer, and great men and saints have often not been able
to dispense with it.</p>

<p>Flattery has now vanished in most of the cruder forms, but is
still just as powerful in more subtle ways. Our manners are founded
on flattery and it is still one of the most powerful aids to
worldly success.</p>

<p>Flattery is the secret of most modern advertisement; the
judgment, taste, and acumen of any possible purchaser are skilfully
flattered&mdash;even by such frank, blunt statements as "<i>you</i> want
the best," or "<i>you</i> mustn't miss this," and it still remains
most valuable in oratory&mdash;oratory is in itself a kind of flattery,
for you imply that your audience is valuable to you, in some way
important and worth the obvious effort you are making.</p>

<p>Flattery is so necessary to all of us that we flatter one
another just to be flattered in return&mdash;there is a certain
convention of mutual flattery that is very dear to most of us.</p>

<p>Of course, flattery that is purely personal is only interesting
to the recipient and those who have devoted themselves to flattery
of one person have generally incurred the coldness of everybody
else; for this reason a great number of authors, poets and artists
have fallen into disrepute.</p>

<p>In the East flattery has always been the language of everyday,
in ancient history we do not find so much of it, though we have
instances enough that it was used, as in Marc Antony's speech over
the body of Julius Caesar in which he undoubtedly used flattery to
move the Roman people.</p>

<p>In early modern history there is also rather a dearth of
instances of flattery, events marched too quickly and were settled
with sword or club before anyone had much chance of trying softer
means, and the only kind of flattery you find is the stupid sort
practised by courtiers towards their King.</p>

<p>The classic instance is King Canute and the waves, a rather
puerile anecdote; one wonders how a monarch of such wisdom had such
foolish followers&mdash;if they were merely paying the usual formal
compliment, it was extremely dull and priggish of Canute to take
them literally.</p>

<p>As times became less rude and as the arts developed, the powers
and uses of flattery became manifold.</p>

<p>And here, in this development of the arts, one comes to a very
interesting point&mdash;which is, the almost complete dedication of
these same arts to flattery. Flattery, first, of the Church,
secondly, of the King or +he patron.</p>

<p>Independence of thought or standpoint was impossible, literature
was locked away, first, in the manuscripts of the monks, then, in
the strictly controlled infant press, painting was devoted entirely
to the Church and the patron; the same is true of architecture and
of the rudimentary music of these times.</p>

<p>Art, therefore, particularly painting, architecture, and kindred
arts and crafts, such as glass-painting, the goldsmith's craft,
works in tapestry, enamels, developed along the lines of strict
convention, a formula of religious or secular flattery.</p>

<p>For this reason neither landscape nor genre-painting made any
appearance till a late date&mdash;or only as could be worked in as
backgrounds or accessories&mdash;and a really unfettered domestic art
expressive of the people themselves does not appear until, in the
Netherlands in the seventeenth century there arose a country that
had thrown off the saint and the patron alike.</p>

<p>Consider how in these early pictures this double domination
shows&mdash;the centre of the composition is occupied by some Divine
Personage or some episode from the sacred story, interpreted
rigidly according to the Byzantine model, and at each side are
either dignitaries of the particular Church that ordered the
picture or the donor and his wife. This convention endured for
centuries, and the only scope the painter had for his own fancy or
observation was in the backgrounds and details, as the delicious
landscapes of the Van Eycks and Gerard David seen through the
delicate arches of their churches and palaces and their lovely
accessories so tenderly copied from articles of everyday use&mdash;in
the Italian school, from Giotto to Perugini, it is the same;
sometimes, as in the case of Fra Angelico, the convention exactly
suited the artist, the mystic piety of the painter found the
perfect ready-made vehicle convenient to his hand, but in most
cases the painter worked mechanically without a spark of spiritual
feeling, taking his models from the types nearest, tending in
Flanders and Germany to ugliness and vulgarity, and in Italy to
insipidness and monotony.</p>

<p>With the Renaissance came the classic inspiration and painters
were then permitted to treat mythological themes, but still always
with reference to a patron and very often with that patron as the
model for Mars or Apollo, and the patroness as Diana or Venus. The
illuminated manuscripts, and the goldsmiths' work, the architecture
and statuary, are all subservient to these two masters, the Church
and the patron, nothing may be praised but one of these, nothing
adorned save the altar or the tomb of the great, the reliquary of
the dead saint or the chamber of the living noble.</p>

<p>Literature comes a little better off; as the patrons liked to be
amused, tales, poems and novels of a more fanciful nature, of a
less rigid convention, were permitted, but the field was very
limited and the incense had here, too, to be fairly strong; the
first illustration to many an old manuscript or book is the author
on his knees humbly presenting the fruit of his labours to the
great one of the moment, and the other illustrations will be found
also for many hundreds of years to consist entirely of sacred
subjects, scenes from the lives of kings and patrons and their
portraits.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that these portraits were none of them in
themselves flattering, but that was due to the painter's lack of
skill, not of good will.</p>

<p>As Dryden said:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"Hard features every bungler can command,<br>
To draw true beauty needs a master hand."</p>

<br>

<p>And nearly all these early portraits are dolefully plain and
often comic; Jan van Eyck, who must be considered one of the
earliest portrait painters of any distinction, viewed his subjects
with a ferocious sincerity that brings them out repulsive to a
degree, and yet with an air of being extremely good likenesses.</p>

<p>This convention of flattery was by no means out-worn when the
art of painting rose to its height; Velasquez, Raphael,
Michelangelo, Titian, were all subservient to masters, hampered and
irritated by the need to flatter and please&mdash;the greatest of all,
Leonardo da Vinci, spent his life in the service of petty Italian
tyrants.</p>

<p>Velasquez, who is perhaps the most perfect technical painter
that ever lived, was in particular the victim of the patron system;
his genius was on robust, material lines and his early works show
that he delighted in the common life of everyday; but the greater
part of his life was spent in painting the members of the pompous
and formal Spanish Court, infantas disguised in the brocade and
whalebone of a monstrous fashion with their curls suspended on
sticks like rows of red-herrings, and rouge on their faces, necks,
and hands.</p>

<p>Not only did Velasquez have to keep on painting Philip IV when
he must have known that sombre face by heart, but even had to waste
his time colouring the royal scenery when Philip fancied amateur
theatricals; every artist in every age always has, with few
exceptions, the necessity of earning his living, but it is much
easier to do this nowadays by expressing yourself without reference
to any patron than it ever has been before, and one wonders what
works these men of such stupendous genius would have produced in
the free air of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Philip IV was very appreciative of Velasquez and flattered him
when shown the artist's portrait of himself by painting the cross
of Santiago on the breast, thereby, no doubt, spoiling the
picture.</p>

<p>Rubens was, by interest, an arch-flatterer; it was easy also to
his opulent temperament to over-state, and he lived in an age when
flattery as a fine art was rising to its height; much of his finest
work is spoilt for the present day by this fault, notably the
paintings executed for the Luxemburg Palace by order of Marie de
Medicis in honour of the husband she had never loved, Henri IV.</p>

<p>Some of them approach absurdity, as when Apollo and the Muses
teach the little Marie de Medicis the arts (Apollo with a large
'cello and the Muses most ill-drawn by some blundering pupil), and
where Marie and Henri meet in the clouds as Juno and Jupiter. The
"Apotheosis of James I" on the ceiling of the Banqueting Hall in
Whitehall Palace has the same fleshy, clumsy spread of limb, the
same opulent colour&mdash;the hero seems to be rather hauled than raised
to the circle of the gods.</p>

<p>Some of Rubens's pupils, among them the renowned Jordaens,
decorated the Oranje Zaal in the <i>huis ten bosch</i> at the
Hague, to the memory of the Stadtholder, Frederic Hendrik, who
ruled during the Golden Age of Dutch history. Here is the same
wealth of allegorical and classical allusion, which does not seem
to have been displeasing even to austere patrons, and here, as in
the Luxemburg Rubens, the widow receives a large share of the
homage lavished on her husband.</p>

<p>Vandyck never lifted his brush but he flattered; by his time
beauty had become a convention of portrait-painting, seldom do we
now see the bungler's "hard features."</p>

<p>Charles I probably owes much of his popularity to Vandyck's
enchanting portraits so full of fire and grace&mdash;if he had been
painted by Van Eyck or Holbein posterity would not have been so
interested in him, yet even Holbein, according to legend, so
flattered Anne of Cleves that Henry VIII married her on the
strength of the likeness, with the result that as soon as the King
saw the original the painter had to fly the country.</p>

<p>One would like to see what Vandyck would have made of Queen
Elizabeth, who, avid as she was of flattery, never got a chance
with her painters, who never represented her as anything but a
plain woman and must have contented herself with the accurate
representation of her jewels and gowns.</p>

<p>The fascinating Mary Queen of Scots should have been painted by
Titian; as it is, the best portrait of her is on the war medal at
Breslau; indeed, accurate and pleasing likenesses are more often
found on old medals than in old pictures, possibly because the
profile is usually the most characteristic view of a face and lack
of colour and light and shade makes the artist concentrate on
modelling.</p>

<p>It has always been a difficult task to flatter the great into
taking some course distasteful to themselves and a very easy one to
flatter them along the lines of their own desires. Jean Goujon, the
delicious French artist, lived and flourished by flattering a
frivolous and designing woman, Diane de Poitiers; when Goujon
carved her as Diana, lovely and severe, with braided fantastic hair
and long limbs, she was neither young nor beautiful, and the
flattery is forgotten in the form the artist gave it; Diana is
immortal as one of the children of that cold, ethereal, strange
French Renaissance, not as a portrait of Diane de Poitiers.</p>

<p>In another painting she is flattered by scriptural and classical
allusion at once, being shown as Diana with crescent and bow, and
in the corner there is a scroll on which is painted the quotation
Henri II had chosen from the then fashionable paraphrase of the
psalms by Clment Marot, <i>valet de chambre</i> to the pious and
poetical Marguerite de Navarre, <i>Comme le cerf</i>&mdash;etc., an
allusion both to the King's love of the chase and to the symbolism
of Diane's name.</p>

<p>This lady was also flattered by the introduction of her symbolic
crescents into the design of that rare and exquisite Orion or Henri
Deux ware, manufactured at the Chteau d'Orion by Franois
Charpentier and Jehan Bernait under the direction of the Dame de
Boisy; so a worthless favourite of fortune is commemorated, by this
delicate flattery, on some of the most prized pieces of earthenware
in the world.</p>

<p>The Italians are not greatly addicted to flattery, their
language of compliment is and was so universal that it ceases to be
more than a fashion; it could not be said that Petrarch flatters
Laura, Boccaccio Fiammetta, or Dante Beatrice, though these ladies
are most certainly drawn on a heroic scale beyond the margin of
common life; Italian art, too, at least Italian poetry, is
impersonal; even when their customs were most luxurious, brutal,
and violent, their writing retains that spiritual aloofness which
makes it difficult to judge the characters of the writers and gives
us no hint of the person addressed; Lorenzo de' Medici, in all his
gorgeous carnival songs and wild, beautiful "Selve d'Amore," never
mentions one lady by name.</p>

<p>In Italian painting there is the same divine alchemy; the models
of Michelangelo and Raphael are not flattered but transformed;
Leonardo da Vinci flattered "Beatrix d'Este" possibly in his
precise painting of her pure profile, and "Mona Lisa" certainly; it
is said that this lady, then no longer youthful, refused to let him
paint her faded face, but sent him a portrait done by an earlier
painter and from this he evolved his immortal picture.</p>

<p>Here we rather outstep the limits of flattery and come upon the
transmutation of the ordinary into the sublime by the touch of
genius.</p>

<p>By the end of the seventeenth century, portrait-painting had
declined into a convention of mere prettiness&mdash;Lely's ladies, for
instance, are so much the same that, like prize roses, they are
only known by their labels and only to be distinguished by an
expert; in the hands of Wissing and Kneller portraits became again
far from flattering, though the intention was one of gross
adulation; the clumsy fashion of classic symbolism was now in full
force and nothing can be more tiresome and ugly than those heroes
in cuirass and buskins, laurel wreath and full-bottomed perukes,
astride ill-drawn horses, attended by meaningless female figures in
robes; so universal was this form of flattery that it is quite
difficult to get any idea of the men of this period "in their habit
as they lived."</p>

<p>Towards the end of the eighteenth century there was a charming
revival in portrait painting, but here, both in England and France,
the flattery is still obvious; Reynolds, Romney, Hoppner,
Gainsborough, appear never to have had a plain model and their air
of "fashion" is carried to excess by Lawrence who brings this phase
to an end in an excess of sweetness and softness&mdash;the exact
opposite to the grim fidelity and stern hardness of Jan van
Eyck.</p>

<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds paid a noble compliment to Mrs. Siddons when
he signed his sumptuous portrait of her between the Tragic and the
Comic muse, placing his name on the edge of her robe, saying that
it was fit that he should go down to posterity on the hem of her
garment.</p>

<p>Turning to literature we find flattery equally powerful, the
same in politics and religion.</p>

<p>Taking merely such examples as come to memory there may be
collected a fine medley of instances, of flatterers and flattered,
giving little passing glimpses of many different periods, men and
moods, many different phases of art and manners and many kinds of
flattery.</p>

<p>The most unlikely people have at some time of their lives used
one of these varieties of flattery; John Calvin, most austere and
stern of reformers, who forbade slashed breeches and curled hair in
Geneva under severe penalties, was not above this worldly weakness,
though truly it was for the noble end of enlisting the Emperor as
protector of the Reformed and persecuted Church that he wrote his
famous tract: <i>Need of Reform in the Church,</i> etc.; this
"humble exhortation to the most invincible Emperor Charles V" was
not successful, for Myconius, writing to Calvin, March 6th, 1545,
remarks: "...if the Emperor has read it, the effect hath been
contrary to what you intended, so hotly doth he persecute the
saints in Belgium."</p>

<p>As a young man Calvin had endeavoured to flatter another
monarch, the volatile Franois I, into becoming a convert to the
Reformed Church in the dedication to his <i>Institutio,</i> but
although ranking with De Thou's foreword to his History and
Casaubon's to <i>Polybius,</i> as one of the three most famous
prefaces ever written, it was utterly unsuccessful in its
object.</p>

<p>Another and nobler Churchman endeavoured to secure the
conversion of another French King, the adventurous and irresolute
Charles VIII, but Savonarola can hardly be said to have flattered
Charles save in so far as it was flattery for such as the heroic
saint of Florence to appeal at all to a feeble worldling; rather he
used the grand language of prophecy in conjuring the King to put
the Borgia from the Papal throne, and with such effect that, urged
by that fierce Della Rovere, afterwards the second Julius, the
French guns pointed more than once at Sant' Angelo and the fate of
the Pagan Pope was like to have been decided by the Florentine
friar; but Charles, like every other absolute monarch, saw his own
interest too clearly in the maintenance of the supremacy of Rome
and Savonarola's noble appeal had eventually no more effect than
+he colder efforts of John Calvin.</p>

<p>It was then and for long afterwards impossible for anyone to do
anything without flattering the great&mdash;the only alternative for
anyone who had any work to accomplish was to become an outcast
persecuted and homeless and to die in oblivion or at the
stake&mdash;even the daring Martin Luther had his Maurice of Saxony, and
Santa Teresa was reduced to flattering the Duke of Alva and the
Princess of Etoli.</p>

<p>The Emperor Charles V affected a great modesty and retired from
all the vanities of the world into a convent, but when the Duke of
Borja, who had himself renounced his rank and become the humblest
of friars, visited the Emperor at Yuste, the ex-grandee fell on his
knees and remained so during the interview, the habit of flattery
being more strongly engrained than the affectation of holy
simplicity.</p>

<p>Charles's general, the ill-omened Duke of Alva, put up a statue
to himself in the Netherlands which was, of course, promptly pulled
down the moment his back was turned, and the most curious piece of
flattery that his much-flattered successor, Don Juan of Austria,
ever received must have been when his guardian, Luis da Quixada, on
the occasion of a fire at his house rushed into the flames to save
him, ignoring his own child, not from greater affection, but
because Don Juan was of royal birth.</p>

<p>Of this Quixada's family a contemporary chronicle said: "It
should be written with a quill taken from the wing of the eagle
that circled over Alexander in his conquests"&mdash;a good specimen of
high-flown flattery.</p>

<p>In general it may be said that the flattery offered to monarchs
in the past could hardly be of top crude a quality; even the blunt
and coarse Henry VIII was flattered by his last wife into
rescinding an order for her arrest; she had the wit to say that she
only disputed with him in order that her ignorance might be
enlightened and he was at once appeased; it is only fair to add
that the lady does appear to have had a genuine admiration for her
redoubtable husband, whom she styled "a Leviathan of learning."</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth was flattered, of course, in all manner of ways,
but she who was praised by William Shakespeare needs no other
flattery; his lauds are like his subject, just and lofty; where he
mentions her directly, as in "Henry VIII," he does not lower the
dignity of history, and where he mentions her indirectly in the
famous passage in "A Mid-summer Night's Dream" he does not go
beyond the homage of a courtier.</p>

<p>Edmund Spenser also flattered Queen Elizabeth, but more stiffly
and in terms of high poetry; Gloriana is not a woman raised into a
heroine, but a lay figure in a pageant, a red wig transformed into
"golden wire."</p>

<p>Cromwell was praised finely in his noble ode by Andrew Marvell,
who also took occasion to commend Charles I, which shows very
tenderly in this place.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Who nothing common did<br>
Nor mean<br>
Upon that memorable scene,<br>
But with his keener eye<br>
The axe's edge did try<br>
And laid his comely head<br>
Down,<br>
As upon a bed."</p>

<br>

<p>The use of "common," "comely," and "memorable" is here
singularly happy&mdash;the whole poem indeed is one of the choicest in
the English tongue.</p>

<p>John Milton, Marvell's friend, never flattered in the ordinary
sense, but he certainly exalted Satan in the same way as old myths
and sagas flattered humanity.</p>

<p>Michael Drayton flattered Henry V, but in a noble kind of way.
Cromwell and Charles II were flattered by the same poets, Dryden
and Waller.</p>

<p>Dryden's verses on Cromwell are far superior and seem to be
written with more sincerity, though, judging from his temperament,
it is not likely that this was so; but doubtless he suffered from
paucity of material when dealing with Charles.</p>

<p>The last stanza of "On the Death of the Lord Protector,"</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"His ashes in a peaceful urn shall rest,<br>
His name to future ages show<br>
How strangely high endeavour may be blest<br>
Where piety and valour jointly go."</p>

<p class="first">
&mdash;is, in its simplicity and truth, the finest of all Dryden's
flatteries save the epitaph on Lord Dundee, "Last and Best of
Scots"&mdash;the whole credit of which is not due to him, as the lines
are a translation from the Latin of Dr. Pitcairn.</p>

<p>Charles II, who probably saw through flattery better than most
kings, remarked to Waller that his verses on Cromwell were superior
to those on himself, but Waller had a new flattery ready and
remarked that he always succeeded better in fiction than in
truth.</p>

<p>Dryden was the author of the most lavish praises of the most
unworthy people; he loaded Charles and James and the unfortunate
child who was afterwards the Pretender with the most fulsome
adulation, and after the death of one and the exile of the other
two, said, in another flattering address to Godfrey Kneller:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Thou hadst thy Charles awhile,<br>
And so had[st] I,<br>
But pass we that unpleasing image by,"</p>

<p class="first">
which was signal ingratitude as Dryden had received great
benefits from that King. Neither did Dryden disdain to flatter the
worthless Lady Castlemaine when she encouraged his play.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"So great a soul, such sweetness joined in one<br>
Could only spring from noble Grandison."</p>

<br>

<p>And his lines to the Duchess of York are models of extravagant
laudation without the grace to redeem them that distinguished
earlier essays in this manner of courtliness as in Henry Wotton's
lines to the daughter of James I, Elizabeth of Bohemia,
beginning:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Ye meaner beauties of the skies,<br>
That poorly satisfy our eyes,<br>
More by your number than your light<br>
Ye common people of the skies<br>
Where are ye when the moon shall rise?"</p>

<br>

<p>Dryden was indeed more fitted for satire, which he writes with a
relish always absent from his praise, which was doubtless
undertaken reluctantly and performed half-savagely; most of his
prologues discover the bitterness of the ill-paid hack-writer.</p>

<p>His one-time rival, Settle, on whom he heaped some of the most
scathing abuse in the language, was said to keep a standard
"Marriage ode" and "Elegy" with blanks for the names; he afterwards
sank to the meanness of writing a flattering copy of verses to the
first Lord Jeffreys, but not, to do him justice, before he had been
reduced to the necessity of working puppets at Bartholomew
Fair.</p>

<p>Matthew Prior, brisk diplomat and deft versifier, exposed the
folly of the bombastic flattery of Boileau in his famous parody on
the ode "On the fall of Namur," which he wrote on the occasion of
the recapture of that fort by the Allies in 1695.</p>

<p>"Must stocks and stones be taught to flatter?" he asks,
then:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Are not Boileau and Corneille paid<br>
For panegyric writing?<br>
They know how heroes may be made<br>
Without the aid of fighting."</p>

<br>

<p>Laughing at Boileau who introduces Louis with all the attributes
of Jove in the following lines:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"What frightful power<br>
Advances, clothed in thunder<br>
Against these trembling walls;<br>
What clamour, what fire surrounds him?<br>
It is Jupiter himself&mdash;or the Conqueror of Mons."</p>

<br>

<p>Prior exclaims:</p>

<p class="verse">
"'Tis little Will, the scourge of France<br>
No godhead, but the first of men!"</p>

<br>

<p>A rebuke to Boileau and a true stroke introducing his own
hero.</p>

<p>But Prior himself employed flattery gracefully, as in his
dedication to Lord Dorset when he praised that nobleman's father
and his own early patron, who indeed deserved the gratitude of all
men of letters, then with a woeful heaviness when treating of his
patron, King William, for whom he had a real enthusiasm which,
however, he does not appear to have been able to translate into
words.</p>

<p>Prior wrote several other verses to his hero, who, being the
last man to care for rhymes or praises, certainly never read them;
all the laudatory verses addressed to this monarch, including those
which Jonathan Swift sent with his dedication of the works of his
patron, Sir William Temple, met with the same fate of neglect from
a King who was too austere to be popular, and who remarked, when
induced to touch for the King's Evil: "I wish you better health and
more sense." These were probably his sentiments towards the poets,
but the services of Defoe in "A True-born Englishman," which
scarcely touched on flattery and was a severe blow to the enemies
of the King, earned William's friendship.</p>

<p>Prior reached the height of incense in his lines on the Duke of
Ormond's picture by Kneller:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"O Kneller, could thy shades and lights express<br>
The perfect hero in that glorious dress,<br>
Ages to come might Ormond's picture know,<br>
And palms for thee beneath his laurels grow,<br>
In spite of time thy work might ever shine<br>
Nor Homer's colour last so long as thine."</p>

<br>

<p>This painter was himself a clumsy flatterer, his classical
pieces, as the great picture in Hampton Court of William III, are
dismal examples of the art of flattery. Pope's lines on this
painting are surely satirical, but it is possible that the poet
knew little about the matter.</p>

<p>Kneller was supposed to be inordinately fond of flattery; an
anecdote is told to the effect that John Gay was once reading to
him a copy of complimentary verses of his own composition, which
were so fulsome that the author feared every moment that the
painter would suspect a jest; but at the close Kneller smiled
complacently and remarked:</p>

<p>"But you haf forgot one thing, Mr. Gay&mdash;when I was at Venice I
smell powder and I like de smell, would have been a great general,
Mr. Gay, put dat in!"</p>

<p>It might be imagined that this was a sly laugh at Gay, did not
the actual poem contain a compliment to Kneller, not as a soldier,
but as an engineer, and Pope, when relating how Jacob Tonson
obtained valuable pictures by gifts of venison and flattery said:
"Neither could be too fat for Kneller."</p>

<p>The bombastic flattery of a whole nation to one man is the
spectacle presented by the reign of Louis XIV; the art of adulation
certainly never rose to these heights before or since; it was a
kind of mania in France, like the tulip craze in Holland or the
South Sea Bubble in England; the rest of Europe marvelled at it;
James II told Adda, the Pope's Nuncio, that he considered flattery
and adulation had turned Louis's head. Matthew Prior rebuked the
flourishing paintings in Versailles by saying in answer to the
question whether the decorations of Kensington House were as
splendid&mdash;"the splendours of my master's actions are to be found
anywhere but in his own house."</p>

<p>Still, a reign outwardly magnificent and adorned with every
variety of talent, a series of showy, if empty, victories, a love
of the arts, a generous temper and a certain swell of soul in the
King himself, to a certain degree justified incense that otherwise
had been rank indeed.</p>

<p>With Louvois and Colbert for his ministers, Cond, Turenne, and
Luxembourg for his generals, Vauban for his engineer, Racine,
Corneille, Boileau for his poets, and Moliere for his dramatist, to
mention only a few, the King could not be otherwise than
magnificent and have something of the dazzle of the sun god in the
eyes of his subjects and even a little glitter for posterity.</p>

<p>Versailles is a tremendous effort of flattery; when it was in
the height of its glory there was not a corner that did not echo
the praise of the King who had built it. Here a certain divine,
preaching before the King, said: "All men are mortal," and His
Majesty darted one awful look from the gilt pew, upon which the
sentence was hastily amended"&mdash;<i>almost</i> all men," and His
Majesty was appeased and the great people about him drew their
breaths again; when he was on his death-bed he said to his family
who wept: "Did you think I was immortal?" It would seem as if the
tone should be one of question, not of reproach, as commonly
interpreted, as if he would say: "Were not you also deceived into
thinking I was a God?"</p>

<p>No man ever received more varied and splendid forms of flattery;
two triumphal gates were erected in Paris in commemoration of the
war of 1672 and the much-vaunted crossing of the Rhine, which
Napoleon considered "a fourth-rate military exploit"; it is certain
that he really believed in his own greatness, and firm in that
conviction, was gracious enough to ordinary men; he outlived the
men who had made him great and sank into the dreariest of virtues,
religious fanaticism; the inscription on his coffin-plate, torn off
in the sack of the Cathedral of St. Denis during the Revolution,
was, perhaps, the first simple thing said of Louis XIV and
therefore the most affecting:</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">
HERE IS THE BODY OF LOUIS 14.<BR>
BY THE GRACE OF GOD, KING OF FRANCE<BR>
AND VERY CHRISTIAN KING OF NAVARRE<BR>
WHO DIED IN HIS CHTEAU OF VERSAILLES<BR>
SEPTEMBER 1715<BR>
REST IN PEACE.</p>

<br>

<p>The whole is in a shaking hand and above are his arms faintly
scratched on the copper. After the noisy pageant of his reign these
words read as sadly as sounds a sudden chord at the end of a
triumphal march of music.</p>

<p>King Louis had to use the art of flattery himself on occasion;
the duc de St. Simon draws a picture of him conducting the
money-lender Bernard round Versailles and flattering the fellow
villainously with the ultimate object of negotiating a large
loan.</p>

<p>This was when the dark days were coming and the last ducat,
which the King had so proudly said would win in the great fight,
was found in the bank at Amsterdam, not in French coffers, and the
gold plate had to be sold.</p>

<p>Of all the compliments paid to this King he received none as
magnificent as that paid to Alfonso the Wise; the Cortes of Castile
divided the new code of laws into seven parts and dedicated each
part to a different letter of the King's name; this was lofty and
ceremonious flattery; dignified flatteries were also paid to
greatness by Bossuet, Flchier and Massillon in their Funeral
Sermons.</p>

<p>Bossuet's orations are gorgeous for diction and eloquence; his
genius was fortunate in having generally noble subjects, but even
when praising one not beyond censure, as Henriette-Marie de France,
wife to the first Charles Stewart, or her daughter, Henriette-Anne
d'Angleterre, duchesse d'Orlans, he kept above the mere courtier's
praise and elevated his theme by the treatment of it; though he is
very tender in his treatment of the last princess. "She acquired
two realms by agreeable means" is a jesuitical way of describing
the lady's intrigues, which led to the disgraceful treaty of
Dover.</p>

<p>There are many beautiful strokes in this exquisite flattery of
the dead; "Yes, madame was gentle towards death as she always was
to everyone," and again: "Neither glory nor youth cost her a
sigh"&mdash;"An immense regret of her sins prevented her regretting
anything else."</p>

<p>With Cond, Bossuet had his most splendid chance and used it
splendidly; yet in several passages he unconsciously displays the
mere showy qualities of his hero, a certain affectation of glory,
which was the pose of the country, a certain lauding of common
achievement, an utter misconception of the result of all these
flamboyant feats, an ignorance of the effect of them on the future,
which makes his adulation ring hollow.</p>

<p>The Prince de Cond was a great general and an amiable man, but
no hero unless that title be bestowed on merely successful
warriors; but to Bossuet the war of 1672 was "holy" because it was
against Protestantism, and the worldly Cond became in his eyes "a
man after God's own heart."</p>

<p>There is in his panegyric the same brittle splendour as glitters
in the decorations at Versailles; it raises a gorgeous phantom,
which for the moment dazzles, but when we are used to the radiance
we discover that we gaze on nothing solid but a jewelled sham.</p>

<p>Bossuet much magnifies the famous battle of St. Neff; Madame de
Svign describes it more accurately when she says: "We lost so
much at this victory that, save for the <i>Te Deum,</i> we might
have thought it a defeat."</p>

<p>Flchier, in his sermon on the death of Turenne, contrived to
flatter the King as well as his general.</p>

<p>"We live under a Prince, who, great and brilliant as he is&mdash;was
willing to obey before he commanded."</p>

<p>The subject, however, could not teach the King any of the
science of war; despite Flchier's flowing periods Louis was no
general and was even deficient in personal bravery, and when he, to
whom his poets apologised for comparing him with so mean a
conqueror as Alexander, returned to Versailles with his ladies, his
cooks, his opera company and his flatterers, Turenne might have
said as James did when his son-in-law deserted him&mdash;"after all, a
good trooper would have been more loss."</p>

<p>The great English general who rendered useless the exploits of
Cond and Turenne had no such flatterer as Bossuet or Flechier; the
Duke of Marlborough was praised by Addison, certainly; but "The
Campaign" is no fine poem and the celebrated simile of the angel
"guiding the whirlwind" is unfortunate, for never was there an
eminent man with less of the spiritual in his composition than John
Churchill.</p>

<p>Avarice, which was his most unpopular, but not his worst, fault,
may have been the reason why he was, notwithstanding the great
splendours of his achievements, so little flattered; the nation's
compliment of Blenheim was not one to recommend itself to a mean
man and the Duke's quarrels with Sir John Vanbrugh, the architect,
were miserably protracted; Marlborough was in disgrace long before
the building was finished and it remained incomplete; a rather
meaningless monument like a gushing letter left unsigned.</p>

<p>Neither was the great general well-served by the painters; the
good looks and charm that captivated his contemporaries do not
appear on canvas, where he is shown as florid and rather vulgar.
The same may be said of the other man so distinguished for his
beauty, Monmouth, against whom Marlborough fought at
Sedgemoor&mdash;Dryden says of him: "Paradise was open in his face," but
this is not confirmed by any of his portraits save that mysterious
painting supposed to have been sketched after his death.</p>

<p>The praise of ladies is a softer theme and one more gracious for
poets to handle. Addison is better remembered for that one line "to
love her is a liberal education" than for the whole of "The
Campaign."</p>

<p>Among all his fanciful nymphs Waller celebrated one living
beauty, Dorothy Sidney, Countess of Sunderland; the Countess did
not lose her head over the warm praises of the poet; she survived
her husband, who fell at the battle of Newbury, many years, and
became a shrewd, gossiping old lady and a good letter-writer.</p>

<p>Another lady of this family was praised by Ben Jonson as:
"Sidney's sister, Pembroke's mother&mdash;" This was Sir Philip Sidney
who fell at Zutphen leaving a curiously bright memory only to be
compared to that of Lucius Cary, Lord Falkland, who is for ever
enshrined by Lord Clarendon in his "History of the Rebellion."</p>

<p>That voluminous writer, Dupleix, flattered the Queen of Navarre
during her lifetime and wrote a satire on her after her death; this
is the very ugliest side of Court flattery. This lady, Margaret of
all the Margarets, received much extravagant flattery; she seems to
have been a most attractive, witty woman; among all the hyperbole
written of her, one remembers the impression given by one simple
statement&mdash;when the chronicle says: "When the Queen of Navarre
danced in the torch-dance at the Louvre her eyes were so bright
that she needed no flambeaux," we do get a picture of radiant and
royal beauty.</p>

<p>The praise of ladies is hardly flattery, but one cannot forbear
from mentioning what is perhaps the most lovely compliment ever
paid to a woman. It is Petrarch's:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Clear, fresh and sweet water,<br>
That bathes the beautiful limbs<br>
Of her who, to me, alone appears<br>
Worthy to be called woman."</p>

<br>

<p>The French have always been very skilful at extravagant
flattery; it is said that Benserade, after trying in vain to extort
a pension from Cardinal Mazarin, broke into the minister's house at
night, forced his way to the Cardinal's bedside, and told him that
he could not contain his joy at being told that some of Mazarin's
poems had been compared to his own wretched efforts.</p>

<p>The ruse sounds laboured but must have been conducted with much
address for the poet received the pension.</p>

<p>It was he that composed the following epitaph on Cardinal
Richelieu, which at least has the merit of frankness.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Here lies, yes, dead, it's true,<br>
The famous Cardinal de Richelieu.<br>
And what makes me so blue,<br>
My pension lies here too."</p>

<br>

<p>Their "pensions" were always a painful subject with poets;
Spenser had to wait wearily for his, Dryden to change his religion
to keep his, Swift became embittered, almost insane, waiting for
one, Samuel Butler could get nothing at all from Charles II, though
that monarch knew portions of "Hudibras" by <i>heart</i>; avarice,
it would seem, is often a stronger passion than vanity, since often
the most fulsome flattery has not been powerful enough to open the
purse-strings of the great.</p>

<p>A writer who patronised kings instead of cringing to them, the
brilliant, generous, and lovable Voltaire, paid, not from
necessity, but desire, many magnificent compliments in his grand
courtly manner.</p>

<p>His dedication of "Brutus" to that most fascinating of rakes and
wits, Viscount Bolingbroke, is a high compliment to the English,
and in itself very interesting.</p>

<p><i>Zare</i> is dedicated to that worthy citizen of Wandsworth,
Mr. Falkener, in graceful words of friendship: "You are English, my
dear friend, and I was born in France, but those who love the arts
are all compatriots."</p>

<p>Voltaire had always something lively and pleasingly daring in
his writing that shows even in these dedications; <i>Mahomet</i>
was dedicated, by a happy stroke, to the Pope: "to the Head of the
true Religion I dedicate this work against the founder of a false
and barbarous sect."</p>

<p>Voltaire did not lose his turn of language when writing
Italian.</p>

<p>Benedict XIV seems to have been overwhelmed by the
compliment.</p>

<p>Overcome by receiving all at once a five-act drama, a poem on
Fontenoy, the lines on his own portrait and the flattering letter,
the Pope returns a rather touching compliment which has all the
pleasing simplicity of the Italian. He proceeds to appoint Voltaire
arbitrator in a scholarly dispute about a line in Virgil; it is a
curious and graceful compliment.</p>

<p>Voltaire dedicates <i>Mrope</i> to Scipion Maffei, author of
the Italian <i>Mrope</i> which he had at first meant to translate
into French; he found the two languages so different that he wrote
an original play. Voltaire concludes with a fine compliment:
"Posterity will learn with delight that your country has rendered
you the rarest honours and that Verona has raised a statue to you
with this inscription: 'To Marquis Scipion Maffei living,'&mdash;an
inscription as fine in its way as that one reads at Montpellier:
'To Louis XIV after his death.'"</p>

<p>Voltaire's flattery was always gracious and grand, like a
nobleman's salute&mdash;in offering "L'Orphelin de la Chine" to the duc
de Richelieu, he says: "I want, Monseigneur, to present you with a
beautiful Genoa marble and I have only Chinese figures to offer
you."</p>

<p>This allusion to the gratitude of Genoa, the town that the Duke
had saved, could not be more delicately turned; the whole
dedication is charming; the play itself makes an interesting
comparison with that written on the same subject by Metastasio; it
is extraordinary how differently the same anecdote is treated.</p>

<p>The much-flattered madame de Pompadour received a dignified
homage from Voltaire when he was already old: "...I dare to thank
you publicly for the protection you have offered to a great number
of artists, writers and other people of merit."</p>

<p>This was little more than the truth; the lady was a magnificent
patroness; Boucher's pictures of her immortalise an epoch. She gave
an Abb, afterwards the Cardinal de Bernis, a pension of 1400
livres and apartments in the Tuileries for some pretty verses that
he wrote in her honour. A few graceful lines have seldom been so
well paid.</p>

<p>One compliment paid to madame de Pompadour had disastrous
results; she was so flattered by receiving a personal letter from
the wily Maria Theresa that to please the Empress she involved
France in the Seven Years War.</p>

<p>In his oration on the officers who died in the campaign of
1741&mdash;the disastrous retreat from Prague&mdash;Voltaire praises, in a
warm and moving fashion, a very different person from the marquise
de Pompadour; this was his friend, the young marquis de
Vauvenargues, the famous philosopher who faced a sad suffering life
with such patient serenity.</p>

<p>Vauvenargues himself, most pure-minded and austere of men, wrote
an <i>Elegy on Louis XV.</i> It makes strange reading now, but
there can be no doubt that it was written in perfect sincerity, and
at that time, Louis le Bien-Aim, with his beauty, his gifts, his
popularity, may have well seemed to the ardent spirit of
Vauvenargues to have promised to become a great sovereign; the
subject did not live to see the King become old in contempt, sloth
and vice, or to hear that thundering rush of feet to the new King's
room when the one candle went out at the King's window in
Versailles and what was left of the once splendid youth, lay, a
wretched ruined body, forsaken and despised.</p>

<p>Satirists are seldom successful when they endeavour to flatter;
Hogarth dedicated "The March to Finchley" to the King, but George,
furious, naturally enough, at the caricature of his soldiers,
expressed his dislike of the picture very forcibly, and Hogarth in
a rage inscribed the picture to the King of Prussia.</p>

<p>A forgotten worthy, one Simon Degge, was happier in his methods;
in his book, "The Parson's Counsellor," he wrote a dedication to
Woods, Bishop of Lichfield, praising him for restoring Lichfield
Cathedral which had been nearly destroyed during the Civil War; the
bishop had not really touched a stone, but the sarcasm told, and,
for very shame, he rebuilt the church.</p>

<p>There is not, perhaps, in any language a more touching and
beautiful compliment than that uttered by Roland, when, after the
fatal battle of Roncesvalles, he brought the body of Oliver and
those of the other dead peers to be blessed and absolved by the
dying Archbishop Turpin who was his sole fellow survivor:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
Sweet companion Oliver<br>
Never in all chivalry<br>
Has there been such a knight as thou.</p>

<br>

<p>This poem, "La Chanson de Roland," is perhaps one of the finest
pieces of flattery a poet ever paid to his own country.</p>

<p>But this is exquisite flattery, the perfection of the art that
has been practised by famous men in all ages; this is homage
indeed, for it has preserved the memories of persons otherwise not
even names to-day, and heightened the renown of those already by
their own merits great.</p>

<p>Flattery always reads more unconvincingly than satire, unless
this be too utterly savage, for instance when Pope writes: "Manners
with candour are to Benson given&mdash;to Berkeley every virtue under
Heaven." The second line does not sound very likely, though one is
assured that the venerable prelate praised was a saint, yet the
first line seems quite a life-like touch.</p>

<p>As instances of praise that sound both noble and true, one may
mention the epitaph of the Duke of Newcastle in Westminster Abbey:
"All the sisters were chaste and all the brothers valiant." And
also the remark made of one of the Earls of Derby by an old
chronicler, that when he died the noble virtue of hospitality
seemed to fall asleep!</p>

<p>In conclusion, one may mention a few of the famous people who
neither wrote nor painted, who had indeed no particular gifts, but
who contrived by understanding the art of flattery to rule kings,
queens, and nations.</p>

<p>Madame Concini, an Italian of humble birth, ruled France through
her influence over Marie de Medicis; when she was accused of
witchcraft she was asked what magic she had used to acquire such a
power over the Queen, and she replied scornfully: "The only magic I
have used is the power of a strong mind over a weak one." She might
have said: "I knew how to flatter."</p>

<p>Cardinal Mazarin, who attained to regal power, is an arch-type
of the skilful flatterer&mdash;he never used force till he had exhausted
persuasion, and in the rare cases where his flatteries did not
attain their object, he let his displeasure fall through other
hands so that he was never associated with rebuke or
punishment.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Marlborough kept her remarkable hold over Queen
Anne in the same way, but she lacked the tact of Mazarin and was
cursed with a bad temper, so, in the end, she had to give way to a
more adroit flatterer, Mrs. Masham.</p>

<p>Men like Alberoni, the Abb Dubois, Struenzee, Potemkin, to
mention but a few, achieved their remarkable careers with the aid
of flattery.</p>

<p>The knowledge of how and when to flatter has always been very
useful to criminals and adventurers; in stories of fraud one is
often impressed by the credulity of the dupe&mdash;this often seems
unbelievable.</p>

<p>The secret of this is, of course, flattery, as for instance in
that most gigantic of frauds, the affair of the Diamond
Necklace.</p>

<p>This whole disastrous crime, so complicated, so unbelievable,
that ruined Marie Antoinette and has been called "the prologue to
the French Revolution," was entirely due to the fact that madame de
la Motte was able to flatter the Cardinal de Rohan into thinking
the Queen was corresponding with him.</p>

<p>Gregori Leti told Charles II that he intended to write memories
of his Court&mdash;the King gave permission, but warned him not to give
offence to anyone.</p>

<p>"But if I were as wise as Solomon," protested the historian, "I
must offend someone."</p>

<p>"Imitate Solomon, then," replied the King, "write proverbs and
leave history alone."</p>

<p>But Leti could not forbear from writing his book. When it was
published he was banished the Court.</p>

<p>This was a pretty commentary on the art of flattery, which has
always been, and always will be, one of the graces and one of the
laws of civilisation.</p>

</div>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">
LORD BYRON was a man whose personality was larger than his
achievement and whose fame was larger than either. How can we
account for the Byronic legend or understand why this man, of all
mysterious and fascinating men, should have been extolled all over
Europe as an embodiment of mystery and fascination, or why he
should have been allowed at once the dark attraction of unnamable
sin and the bright brilliancy of heroic virtue?</p>

<p>Romantic of the romantics, the bulk of whose work has perished
because of a tawdry falsity of design and colouring, he was yet
capable of dissecting himself and his times with the sharp cynicism
of the cool intellectual.</p>

<p>A Prince of lovers, the <i>Don Juan de nos jours,</i> symbol of
the seductive and successful libertine, his amorous intrigues were
neither splendid nor satisfying, and appear to have left him not
with the sense of blasting remorse suitable to one of the sombre
rakes, of whom he was the prototype, but rather with the sour
after-taste of one who has, half-heartedly, been intentionally
vicious.</p>

<p>Many of his actions were those of a cad, an egoist, a pampered
<i>poseur</i> who wilfully exaggerated his faults in order to
attract attention, yet was capable of sound common sense, of
desperate impatience with himself, of that pure torment which comes
from the recognition of the unescapable torments of others. The
Byronic "doom," the theme of the gloomy inscrutable hero, beautiful
as Phoebus, cursed as Lucifer, so often copied, so often parodied,
seems now merely silly. Yet Lord Byron's own life was, in fact,
such a story; partly through circumstances, partly through his own
self-conscious efforts, he did, in his own short career, embody the
type and play out the incidents that became so foolishly popular
and were in consequence so sharply caricatured.</p>

<p>The author of "Manfred," "The Corsair," "The Bride of Abydos,"
and "Childe Harold," was himself as dazzlingly handsome, as
ferociously unhappy, as "doomed" as any sardonic, black-cloaked
sinner of them all, and the social crime, through which Byron fell,
was one then considered dark enough to stamp any man "Mad, bad and
dangerous to know," as one of his lovers styled him in a phrase too
clever to be quite true.</p>

<p>Byron probably was nearer madness&mdash;genuine insanity&mdash;than any of
his contemporaries realised&mdash;"bad" only in a small sense; his
faults were petty&mdash;snobbishness, bad taste, uncontrolled temper,
raw vanity, a childish desire to boast and to be praised, remarked,
and feared. "Dangerous to know" is a doubtful description of the
violent dandy <i> bonnes fortunes;</i> it is certain that most of
his mistresses were perilous to <i>him,</i> and that the only woman
for whom he ever felt any sincere tenderness, Augusta Leigh, was,
undoubtedly, fatal to his entire career.</p>

<p>It was the women, hysterical, fine-drawn, idle <i>grandes
dames,</i> like Caroline Lamb, or bold emotional adventuresses like
Claire Clairmont, or stupid acquisitive sensualists like the
Contessa Guiccioli that pursued and captured a resentful,
flattered, insincere, and inwardly wearied lover in the fashionable
poet. His one encounter with "a virtuous woman" broke him. All the
sound and fury of the satanic male, with his brilliant sins and
lurid rebellions, were shattered against the unassailable
respectability of an innocent young lady. In the deadly impact of
this meeting of opposites, it was the obscure, ordinary Annabella
Milbanke that was victorious. Her cool fingers "touched pitch and
were not defiled." Withdrawing herself from the sulphurous
contamination of wickedness, she saved the soul of Augusta Leigh,
to her own satisfaction, and taught the unhappy libertine that it
was, after all, an uncomfortable matter to sin some sins and boast
some boasts in the drawing-rooms of fashionable London. So far
victorious was the high-minded Annabella, that her exhausted
husband, having sounded the depths of vice, sighed in his last days
for a reconciliation with the chilly rectitude of the well-behaved
wife.</p>

<p>The fallen angel with his wings clipped by the hand of
propriety, the roving rake, disgusted with theatrical love affairs,
longed for "life with a virtuous woman in the country." Manfred had
strayed from the edges of the impressive abyss where the
thunder-clouds lowered, and would have liked slippers, a fire-side,
and a housewife's smile.</p>

<p>In brief, Don Juan had made a mess of love, life, and letters,
and but for the supreme good luck of a death that might at best be
termed heroic and was at least dramatic, he might have petered out
as a rustic squire with a managing wife, now and then grinning with
cronies over a glass, at the delicious follies of youth. Either
this or the mad-house might have been the fate of an elderly, a
diseased, a burnt-out Byron. As it was, he died just in time to
establish his fame, his legend, his eternal youth. Missolonghi
perpetuated the Byronic myth as imperishably as if it had been cast
in bronze.</p>

<p>Death has served many famous people very well. Charles I dying
like James II puling and whimpering with senility in cosy exile,
Thomas Chatterton become a prosperous editor or a stout antiquary,
Mary Queen of Scots succumbing to a bad leg and a tuberculosis of
the throat, none would be the figures haloed with romance as they
are now, with their uncommon lives sharply ended by violent, but
brilliant exits. What manner of man was this too famous poet, of
whose renown we are beginning to be a little weary and whose main
works we never read?</p>

<p>George Noel Gordon Byron's destiny seemed shaped as much by
heredity as by environment. It is possible to suppose that had he
never heard of the "doom" in his blood on the one hand, and had
been sensibly educated on the other, his tale might have been less
showy and more happy.</p>

<p>He was born in 1788, the period of titanic upheaval in America,
France, and Ireland when the "freedom of man" was in the air, and
his boyhood was passed during the exasperating tumult of the
Napoleonic wars, in which the cries of the new democracy were being
heard among the half-insane carnage.</p>

<p>His descent was dubious on both sides; his father, Captain
Byron, was one of those professional libertines and gamblers, who
so plentifully garnish the eighteenth century of fiction and of
fact&mdash;a Lord Camelford&mdash;a Richard Lovelace; in sober terms an
irresponsible rogue, whose person and address were his only
passport to toleration.</p>

<p>It was a noble family&mdash;in fact what so many lesser gentry have
sighed to be&mdash;descended from a princely French house, that of
Biron, resplendent with Marshals and Dukes, and of Buren, one of
whose sons became a favourite of an Empress and the ruler of
Courland. The members of the English branch of Byron had a
fascinating reputation for all the brilliant vices, were given to
inter-marrying and eccentricity, and showed their only worldly
cleverness in their marriages with heiresses.</p>

<p>When George Noel Gordon Byron was born, the holder of the title
was the fifth baron, "The Wicked Lord," a creature of almost
fabulous outline. The outstanding stain on his murky career had
been the duel with William Chaworth, in a locked room by the light
of a candle and with swords of unequal length, which had ended in
the death of Chaworth, and the trial of the noble lord for murder.
He escaped punishment by pleading "benefit of clergy" after
standing trial by his peers. The cause of the duel had been a
dispute about the number of pheasants on the several estates of the
fine gentlemen gathered in a London tavern.</p>

<p>While his heir was being "dragged up" in undignified poverty,
Lord Byron lived in the semi-monastic gloom of Newstead Abbey,
solitary, but not softened, since he was maliciously employed in
illegally selling the timber and otherwise damaging the estate,
which was by no means opulent.</p>

<p>On his mother's side the future lord was not more blessed. Miss
Gordon of Gight was Captain Byron's second wife, whom he married
for the money that he soon dispersed. She claimed, rather loosely,
royal blood, but at least her name was that of the splendid clan of
which the Earls of Huntly "the cocks of the north" were the
chieftains. Apart from this she had no advantages; an acknowledged
fool, naturally ill-tempered, soured to frenzy by ill-fortune, she
found herself widowed without means when the boy was three.</p>

<p>A cheerless existence of debt, bitterness, and obscurity was
passed by the lonely child and embittered woman. There was no home
beyond cheap lodgings, mostly in Aberdeen, and worst of all the boy
was lame and his mother flung this defect in his face when, in one
of her evil moods, she broke crockery and hurled pots and pans
about. It now seems possible that this famous deformity, which
played such an ugly part in Byron's life, was purely nervous, and
that kindness, a stable atmosphere, and early treatment, might have
saved him from what was to be a veritable blight.</p>

<p>In 1798 the fifth lord died in unrepenting old age, leaving a
dilapidated mansion and an impoverished estate to the unhappy boy.
Mrs. Byron's vulgar tantrums alienated her son's legal guardian,
Lord Carlisle, and mother and son, now a lord, severely left to
themselves, lived still in lodgings in Nottingham and London.</p>

<p>There was a hideous episode when the child's limping foot was
tortured in a quack's wooden instrument, there was the growing
boy's desperate shame at his mother's furies, and silly pamperings,
and at thirteen there was Harrow.</p>

<p>The lad was sullen, unattractive, "wolfish"; these defects being
obviously the manifestations of deep unhappiness. The first shoots
of passion added to his other torments. Close to Newstead, then
let, Mrs. Byron was established in a small house, and near this was
Annesley, where dwelt Mary, a descendant of the Mr. Chaworth who
had been the victim of the "Wicked Lord." The plump, shy, sensitive
Byron loved in vain; the admired girl chose Jack Musters, and there
is a tale that she casually remarked on "that lame boy," a dart in
a heart already lacerated.</p>

<p>In 1801 he met for the first time Augusta Byron, his father's
daughter by a first marriage with Lady Carmarthen. For her he felt
a quiet soothing tenderness, which meant more to him than the
exciting hero worship given him by the younger boys at Harrow, the
handsome and emotional Clare, Delaware, Long, and Gray.</p>

<p>At seventeen Byron left Harrow, by no means in a cloud of glory;
idle, irritable, lusciously romantic, he was considered "not a
proper associate" for the average Harrovian.</p>

<p>His relations with Mrs. Byron were then such that he cried: "Am
I to call this woman mother?" With his nerves badly rasped he went
up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1805, and gloomed about with
Edward Long, Edleston, a sentimental consumptive young chorister,
and other ardent companions.</p>

<p>There was five hundred pounds a year, brandy, music, romantic
friendship, but the restless lad was not satisfied. The deepest
sting was his insignificance; he was provincial, awkward,
self-conscious, aware of a strain of effeminacy, of a painful
admiration for that assured composure, that worldly
self-sufficiency which he never quite attained and which probably
no one, who in childhood has been neglected and despised, ever does
attain. To balance this sense of inferiority Lord Byron posed with
men-servants, carriage, dogs, saddle-horses, clothes, fantastic
even for those expensive days. He got into debt and published some
verses, "Hours of Idleness," which sold well and, what was more
important to the author, solidified and clarified his
personality.</p>

<p>A number of new friends acclaimed in the poet what they would
have despised in the vapouring undergraduate. He began to shake off
his fears and repressions, the "nerves" consequent on his mother's
treatment. He boxed, swam, fenced, rode&mdash;and not unskilfully.</p>

<p>He got into debt to the extent of 12,000 on personal
extravagances, which included a mistress and spanking-horses to
show off at Brighton, before he left Cambridge in 1808.</p>

<p>It was the era of the dandy&mdash;the elegant idle man of fashion, at
once subtle, shallow, useless, and symbolic of all humanity's
decorative qualities. Like many another with yearnings for this
role, Byron had not a sufficient income to support it. His
snobbishness, which sprang, not unnaturally, from the knowledge
that his early upbringing had not been equal to his birth, was
stung by the coldness of high-bred London. There is pathos in
Byron's insistence on his rank, vulgar as it rings, for this was
but a gesture of self-defence, a desperate attempt to efface the
memory of his impossible mother and the squalid lodgings in
Aberdeen.</p>

<p>Disgruntled and melancholy, the young man, just of age, retired
to the uncomfortable gloom of Newstead, gaunt amid the
timber-stripped park. He found some pleasure in writing "English
Bards and Scotch Reviewers," a satire against the critics of his
first efforts, but the Byronic "doom" was beginning to darken down,
or so he thought. The pose of the misunderstood solitary became
confirmed, even the death of his dog seemed part of a curse. An
attempt to be "wicked" was not found very stimulating. Endeavouring
to exploit the Gothic atmosphere of Newstead, and to imitate the
Hell Fire Clubs, then a little out of date, there were schoolboyish
orgies when the young lord and some Cambridge friends dressed up in
hired monkish habits, drank out of a skull conveniently turned up
by the gardener, and entertained young ladies who they fondly hoped
would pass as members of a harem, or, at least, as "Paphian girls"
fresh from the Isle of Venus.</p>

<p>This rather dismal and theatrical display having come to an end
and no desirable opening showing either in private or in public
life, Mrs. Byron being still alive and the <i>salons</i> of the
<i>beau monde</i> still closed to him, Byron went abroad, ready for
any rare or desperate adventure. He had with him a university
friend, John Cam Hobhouse; there was no objective in view&mdash;"the
gloomy wanderer" had no desire ever to see England again, and not
much desire to see anything else. The journey was across Portugal
(then the seat of war), Spain, Malta, the Levant, and Greece. It
was all at concert pitch, exotic love affairs, shipwrecks,
thunderstorms, "dressings up," broodings in the moonlight or
swimming of the Hellespont, some real raptures, many painful
poses.</p>

<p>The friendship with Hobhouse did not stand the strain, they
parted at Constantinople after dividing a posy of flowers "woefully
sick" of each other.</p>

<p>After two years of this, Byron returned to England. There was
real cause for gloom in the early deaths of his first friends,
Long, Wingfield, and Dorset, while the end of the terrible mother
in a fit of fury was painfully ugly. Then Matthews, another
charming associate, was drowned at Cambridge&mdash;Byron, almost with
relish, referred to "some curse."</p>

<p>However, he had brought back with him from his travels, together
with skulls, urns, tortoises, and a flagon of hemlock, the
manuscript of "Childe Harold," cantos I and II. These were
published in 1812.</p>

<p>The author had already made some friends in the great world,
Lord Holland and Tom Moore, and achieved some effect with a manly
speech in the House of Lords on the troubles in the industrial
North. With the appearance of the dashing poem, the noble author
found himself suddenly, not only at the peak of literary
attainment, but the centre of a frenzied personal worship. The
glimpses of autobiography&mdash;the picture of the dark stranger with
his unutterable gloom, his "Marble heart," his deep, secret,
unattained passion&mdash;drove all the idle fashionables crazy to
understand, to console this wicked fascinating despair. How
seductively cynical, how meltingly romantic it was to read:</p>

<br>

<p class="poem">
"For he through sin's long labyrinth had run<br>
Nor made atonement when he did amiss&mdash;"</p>

<br>

<p>With such vivid force had Byron dramatised his own sensations,
his own experiences, that he had created a second self more
brilliant, more complete than the reality. His personal beauty
completed his conquest of the female part of <i>le beau monde</i>
of the Regency.</p>

<p>Short, inclined to stoutness, slightly lame, with affected,
self-conscious manners, rather ill-bred, Byron yet possessed a
beauty of feature that was neither effeminate nor ignoble. It was a
Greek mask, with soft bright eyes, proud lips, a sulky brow and the
added attraction of richly-waving chestnut hair. These cherished
locks were sometimes put in curl-papers, but Byron cursed himself
as a fool for the weakness. His voice was charming, his hands white
and slender, his figure, by dint of anxious dieting, shapely, the
lameness was scarcely noticeable&mdash;was even seductive with its hint
of the cloven hoof.</p>

<p>Then there was the title, the wicked doomed ancestry, the tales
of orgies at Newstead and abroad, the gloomy reserve with which the
awkward man concealed his social inadequacies, the athletic
prowess, the "Crede Biron!" motto, the air of cynical misanthropy
that covered so much unsuspected uneasiness. Nothing was
lacking.</p>

<p>The bullied child of Aberdeen, the sulky fat schoolboy "sent
down" from Harrow, the posing, obscure undergraduate had merged
into a man more famous, more sought-after, than any man before or
since. London society had never known anything like it; the
huntresses were hot-foot on the track of an unbelievably desirable
prey. The first of these eager Dianas to score a success was Lady
Bess-borough's daughter, Lady Caroline, the spoilt, whimsical,
bad-tempered, extremely fashionable wife of William Lamb,
afterwards Queen Victoria's Lord Melbourne.</p>

<p>"Caro" was thin, lazy, with huge eyes and capricious manners,
selfish, unscrupulous, shameless, but she queened it at Melbourne
House, most exclusive of aristocratic mansions; she was definitely
<i>bon ton</i> in a society ruled by the changing mistresses of the
Prince Regent. Byron's love affair with this elegant lady completed
the furore the "Childe" made in London society. He never cared much
for her, but he was dazzled by her "connexions" and would not shake
off her hysteric clutch. Afterwards he frankly admitted that the
tiresome woman "had few personal attractions" and that he had to
force his inclinations in the whole affair. No doubt, however, he
enjoyed the sharp emotionalism of the intrigue while it lasted.</p>

<p>It was an exciting summer for London society, that of 1812, when
the waltz and Lord Byron went to the head of many fair ladies.
Byron's success had its drawbacks; he soon wearied of "Caro," whose
behaviour became so volcanic that she had to be withdrawn to
Ireland; he wearied too of the letters she sent from her exile; his
debts mounted and Newstead would not let.</p>

<p>A piquant friendship with Lady Melbourne, his mistress's
mother-in-law, and a quasi-domestic episode with Lady Oxford, then
in the last glow of her beauty and at the placid end of her lovers,
helped the poet to endure the fame that caused women to faint at
his glance, and to bombard him with petitions for a ringlet or a
<i>rendez-vous.</i></p>

<p>Towards the end of this hectic year Byron met Annabella
Milbanke, the niece of Lady Melbourne, a serious, high-minded,
cool-headed young woman. Scorning to join in the excitement that
surrounded the wicked poet, she ignored him with a deliberate
indifference that piqued and fascinated the pursued, harried
genius. She was also a considerable heiress. In her virginal person
seemed the promise of financial security, consolidated social
position, soothed nerves, a refuge from Lady Caroline, and that
definite domestic establishment necessary to a man of title.</p>

<p>Marriage was offered and refused; the family "doom" drew nearer
the sixth lord. In 1813 his half-sister, Augusta Leigh, withdrew
from the distresses of poverty and a spendthrift husband to the
shelter of Lord Byron's house. They had always been attracted, at
ease in each other's company, mutually tender, affectionate, and
loving. They had not been long under one roof when scandal was busy
over their relationship. Augusta, plastic, gay, unmoral, and
unhappy, seemed not to realise where she was drifting, while her
half-brother alternated between a boasting zest in the fulfilment
of the family curse and his own peculiar "doom," and a real passion
for a beloved woman&mdash;"a perfect and boundless attachment" as he
afterwards named his feeling for Augusta. Warned by his female
mentor, Lady Melbourne, of his social peril, Byron parted from his
half-sister and tried to distract himself with a half-cynical,
half-sentimental, affair with Lady Frances Wedderburn Webster, and
by writing "The Bride of Abydos," a tawdry Eastern tale with the
"brother and sister" theme.</p>

<p>To this indiscretion he added wild talk, half-veiled hints
concerning the paternity of Medora, Augusta Leigh's child, born
that September, and a general dramatic self-exploitation that
seemed touched with insanity. The growing scandal, which he seemed
to enjoy, alarmed his friends; Augusta herself joined in the effort
to steer him into safety by means of a wife. Annabella Milbanke,
who had maintained a prudent correspondence with him ever since she
had rejected his proposal, was again selected to snatch this brand
from the burning.</p>

<p>In January, 1815, the year of Waterloo, they were married in
spite of the groom's rave doubts. Miss Milbanke undertook the
adventure in a spirit of duty and self-sacrifice, she needed all
her fortitude. Her husband turned on her immediately: "You should
have married me when I first proposed." The delay, he believed, had
meant the episode with Augusta and endless remorse, misery, and
regret. The honeymoon was terrible; though, no doubt, the man's
despair was genuine, the theatrical displays with which he
tormented his young wife, make unsavoury reading. A grotesquely
horrible visit to Augusta's house where Byron's behaviour passed,
he seemed to think, as sardonic passion, but was nearer insanity,
enlightened the poor bride about the ugly truth behind all this
fume and fury. With considerable dignity and self-control she made
common cause with the terrified Augusta, who turned to her for
help, to save, if not the man, at least the woman, from an
impossible passion. The oddly assorted three moved to London, No.
13 Piccadilly Terrace, where the emotional tension was not helped
by brandy drinking on the part of Byron, and debts and duns.</p>

<p>At the end of their marriage year a child was born; humiliating
noisy scenes with creditors, the entry of bailiffs into the house,
and, when her baby was three weeks old, Lady Byron had left the
house to visit her mother.</p>

<p>She was never to return.</p>

<p>With surprising clearness of insight she had discovered that her
husband was impossible to reform or to live with. She had learnt
from a perhaps fallible medical report, which she had had the good
sense to obtain, that the frenzied poet was not "mad." She had
judged for herself that he was bad and that she could not reform
him. She had the courage to sacrifice any possible hope of
happiness in order to save herself and her child from moral
degradation. A short note from her father, Sir Roger Milbanke,
informed the bewildered and angry husband that his wife would not
return to him; he was, under pressure, induced to sign a deed of
separation. He was never to see Annabella or the baby, Augusta Ada,
again. This ruined him; his wife's cold virtue shattered him as
steel shatters glass; the prim schoolgirl of twenty-one with her
virginal inexperience destroyed, deliberately and for ever, the
most famous man of the moment, who had bragged so lavishly of his
Satanic contempt of the conventions. She also deprived him of
Augusta Leigh, whom she continued to dominate. The scandal was
immediate and deadly. Mrs. Leigh was "cut"; no woman would speak to
Byron, every room he entered emptied at once of ladies. By the end
of April, 1816, he had left England for ever.</p>

<p>In Geneva he met Shelley, who had also been obliged to leave his
native country with his second wife, Mary Godwin, and her
step-sister, Claire Clairmont, who had forced herself on Byron
shortly before and who now greedily reclaimed an unwilling
lover.</p>

<p>Soothed by Shelley's influence, Byron completed "Childe Harold,"
wrote part of "Manfred" and "The Prisoner of Chillon." These,
composed in a frenzy of personal emotion, contain some of his best
work, far better than the much-acclaimed Oriental poems that he had
written at the height of his fame.</p>

<p>His love for Augusta Leigh continued; he dared to hope that she
would throw all to the winds and join him in his exile&mdash;but Lady
Byron stood between him and his "criminal desires." She so
influenced Augusta that that poor lady obtained a moral victory
over herself&mdash;her correspondence with her half-brother was
supervised by the lofty-minded Annabella, until it became what
Byron, in disgust, termed "damned crinkam crankam." His own side of
the correspondence leaves no doubt of the sincerity of his own
feelings&mdash;"<i>we were just formed to pass our lives
together.</i>"</p>

<p>After he had flared up in his Geneva poems, Byron moved to
Venice. Everything important in his life was over; the remaining
years were but a marking-time till his death. Judged by ordinary
standards he went to pieces morally and physically.</p>

<p>Shelley, in 1818, was shocked by the sordid cheap orgies of the
Palazzo Mocenigo, half-harem, half-thieves' kitchen, where
ruffians, wild animals, the female scum of the gutters, moved
through a fantasy of disreputable confusion. Byron himself showed
signs of a very visible damnation&mdash;the premature senility that
brought Robert Burns low. The famous ringlets became grey, the
beautiful face bloated and pasty, the slender hands fat, the
elegant figure stout and stooping. He wrote his autobiography,
which was never to be published, the splendid "Don Juan" and the
lovely: "So, we'll go no more a roving"; in 1819 he was rescued
from his harpies and jobbers by Contessa Guiccioli as neatly as
Annabella had rescued him from Augusta.</p>

<p>"I have been more ravished," he wrote, "than anyone since the
siege of Troy." Soon Teresa Guiccioli and her family, the Gambas,
were entirely on his hands, and he settled down dully in a dull
place, Ravenna, until 1821, when he moved to Pisa. Claire
Clairmont, whom he refused ever to see, sent him by Shelley their
daughter, the ironically-named <i>Allegra</i>; the unwanted child,
despatched to a convent, soon died. There was a quarrel with the
Shelleys in which Byron behaved badly; he wrote huge laboured
poetic dramas, impossible even for that turgid age.</p>

<p>With the sale of Newstead there was money and an odd interest in
it, a watching of household books, a checking of expenses that
would have been more useful in his earlier career. There was
anxiety over another asset once so wilfully squandered&mdash;his health,
a dreary diet flavoured with magnesia, a pathetic attempt to retain
some semblance of youth.</p>

<p>In 1822 occurred the semi-comic episode of Leigh Hunt's visit to
the salmon-pink Leghorn villa, and immediately afterwards the pure
tragedy of Shelley's drowning. The horrible spectacle of his
friend's cremation on the foreshore tore at Byron's nerves and he
escaped to Genoa with the tiresome Hunt family clinging to him.
While the two men tried to get along together, "The Liberal" Mrs.
Hunt, difficult and respectable, sparred with Teresa Guiccioli,
silly and sentimental, and the Hunt children quarrelled with the
Byron menagerie. The fall of Lucifer was without grandeur.</p>

<p>In 1823, Lady Blessington, expecting to find a noble creature of
romantic gloom and power, discovered instead rather a figure of
fun, flippant, without dignity or breeding, out of date and
painfully ridiculous in his clothes of the cut of fifteen years
before; his green tartan jacket, his nankeen gaiters, his trousers
"shrunk from washing"; even his horse hung with senseless gaudy
ornaments.</p>

<p>Annabella was at once avenged and justified. The apostle of wild
romanticism was, in his own person, realistic enough, the splendid
sinner had become merely an object of compassion or disdain.</p>

<p>His innate genius showed in the effort he made to get out of the
silly back-water where he stagnated. Greece was making a spasmodic
and divided attempt for freedom and John Cam Hobhouse was on the
English Committee to assist the Hellenes. Byron offered his help,
it was accepted; in August, 1823, he landed at Cephalonia with
Trelawney, one of Shelley's friends, Pietro Gamba, Teresa's
brother, and eight servants. He was in high spirits, though he knew
the difficulties ahead and even had a presentiment that he would
die in Greece. There was nothing gorgeous or exciting about the
enterprise, but Byron showed at first a manly spirit&mdash;wished he
"had never written a line"&mdash;had not come to Greece "to scribble
more nonsense"&mdash;and dismissed the local colour as "antiquarian
twaddle."</p>

<p>Six months of dismal inaction were spent at a cottage near
Cephalonia; Trelawney, sick of waiting and of Byron's renewed
neurotics, left for the mainland. In December, 1823, Byron, in the
hope of action, decided to join a party of rebels. This was that of
Prince Mavrocordato whose headquarters were at Missolonghi, an
unhealthy town on the mud banks of the Gulf of Corinth. Here Byron
landed in the first week of 1824 in a scarlet uniform with his
Greek guards, his servants, his arms and a miniature of his
daughter, Augusta Ada, but not wearing the Greek helmet he had
designed for this event. Trelawney had advised him against this
theatrical touch.</p>

<p>From January to April Byron lived in his three-storied house on
the lagoon in the mud and rain, surrounded with every discomfort
and exasperation. He was endeavouring to put some organisation into
the Greek resistance against the expected Turkish attack and he
found the lazy and greedy Levantines, with whom he had to deal,
very different from any imaginary heroic figures of antique
Hellas.</p>

<p>In January he composed his own farewell&mdash;it might be taken for
his own elegy and epitaph; in April he caught a chill and in his
fever had those dreams of England, a wife, a child, stability, that
were so recurrent and so vain. On Easter Sunday an encouraging
letter from Hobhouse found him in the last delirium, with Fletcher,
the faithful eccentric valet, trying in vain to take down the
muttered, incoherent final instructions. The last names whispered
were: "Augusta Ada"&mdash;the last words: "I want to go to sleep."</p>

<p>There was a distant threat of thunder when he died on the
evening of April 19th, 1824.</p>

<p>The brow-beaten, sensitive child, the sulky idle schoolboy, the
pathetic <i>poseur</i> of Cambridge and Newstead, the most famous,
the most infamous man in London, the keeper of odalisques in
Venice, Augusta Leigh's willing lover, the unwilling lover of so
many other women, had all merged into that figure will the classic
mask, made beautiful again by death, that lay beneath the alien
shroud in the mean room at Missolonghi&mdash;and the Byron legend was
complete. The discipline of death had given dignity to one, unable
to endure any other discipline, and once more the accident of
mortality had conferred immortality:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"If thou regrett'st thy youth, why live?<br>
The land of honourable death<br>
Is here: up to the field, and give<br>
Away thy breath!<br>
<br>
Seek out&mdash;less often sought than found&mdash;<br>
A soldier's grave, for thee the best;<br>
Then look around, and choose thy ground,<br>
And take thy rest."</p>

<p class="first">
THE work that brought Guillaume Thomas Raynal such brilliant
success in his lifetime would be now a mere curiosity of
literature, with only the odd fascination of a museum piece, were
it not that this "History of the Two Indies" has three distinct
claims on the interest of the student of literature. First, it is
an illustration of the power of literary rogues; and to study the
past fashions in literature, their importance, scope and purpose,
helps to enable us to put in true perspective the bewildering
fashions of our time, which so confuse the originator and the
imitator, the permanent and the transient. Secondly, this book is
an example of something more than a fashion, since it profoundly
influenced popular opinion and was credited with being one of the
sparks that ignited the furnace of the French Revolution It is,
then, under this aspect, a fair example of the power that even a
mediocre mind, exploiting fallacious ideas, may exercise through
the medium of the pen, if the subject be in favour at the moment
and well enough advertised. Thirdly, this impressive-looking work,
with its massive air of solidity, is an example of bookmaking, a
vice that has much grown upon us of late, and that it is
interesting to observe was deftly practised in the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>Apart from these three points, which make this pompous
compilation worth some study, it has a borrowed brilliance owing to
the connection with the elusive Elisa Draper, the celestial friend
of Laurence Sterne, and in itself possesses an intrinsic charm,
which no doubt helped its enormous popularity. It has the merit,
not uncommon in clumsy discursive productions, of setting the
reader off on pleasing tangents&mdash;rather like one of those old,
large, untidy maps where, when the ignorance of the cartographer
brought him to a pause, he drew some fanciful coast-line, some
imaginary range of mountains, and filled unlikely-looking spaces of
land and sea with odd creatures, fabulous beasts and exciting
little scenes that do truly transport the gazer to those impossible
regions of fantasy for which most of us feel an occasional
nostalgia.</p>

<p>Raynal's life explains his work; he was in his own time
considered a great man, and he performed at least one action that
had a tinge of greatness. For the rest, he was one of those
restless spirits who, either by reason of their gifts or through
chance circumstances, exercise on their times an influence out of
all proportion to their merits.</p>

<p>Born in the last years of the reign of Louis XIV, Guillaume
Thomas Raynal was educated by the Jesuits and entered this famous
Order. In early middle life he left the Society of Jesus and the
priesthood, at the same time abandoning the tenets of Christianity,
not altogether from sincere conviction but with something of the
impatience of one who feels his talents wasted in the provinces and
distinction difficult to obtain in a well-organised establishment
of clever men. Throwing himself on Paris he soon became acquainted
with the philosophers, as the encyclopedists termed themselves, and
eagerly absorbed all the fashionable terms of thought and
expression. For a while he edited the <i>Mercure de France</i>, but
his own writings were sparse, his principal efforts being a history
of the Stadtholdership of the United Provinces and an essay on the
divorce of Henry Tudor and Catherine of Aragon, neither of which
works brought him&mdash;what he keenly desired&mdash;money and fame. He
indeed, greatly to his chagrin, reached late middle age without
cutting any considerable figure in the intellectual society to
which he had attached himself, and his greatest claim to renown was
merely that he was the friend of men like Diderot, Grimm, and
D'Holbach, and echoed their opinions and supported their views.</p>

<p>But an eager, inflammable, not too level-headed writer, with a
facile pen, plenty of courage and gusto, was not likely to lack
inspiration for ever in this forcing house of free-thinking,
sentimentality, utopia-building and general rebellion against all
hitherto accepted conventions, in which the eighteenth-century
Parisian intellectuals fermented and seethed. The hostile
activities of the police and the Church only inflamed further these
rebels against all authority, and with them in all their extremes
of atheism, republicanism, and idealism was Guillaume Thomas
Raynal, though he contrived to avoid the unpleasant attentions of
the law.</p>

<p>Consider the mental atmosphere, stifling, depressing, and
exciting as that of a violent thunder-storm, in which Raynal found
himself, a man nearing fifty, running about the <i>salons</i> of
literary Paris in the 1700's. Apart from the commotion caused by
the exposition of such novelties as the standpoints of the agnostic
and the atheist, there was the ceaseless echo of the cry of "the
rights of man"&mdash;easy to shout, difficult to reduce to a workable
plan. The exile of Jean Jacques Rousseau was all that was needed to
crown the immense popularity of his three great books, which
inspired, maddened, and confused a whole generation; Raynal became
at once an ardent disciple of the author of <i>Du Contrat Social,
La Nouvelle Hlose</i> and <i>Emile</i>. He showed, however, no
practical enthusiasm for the "back to nature" movement, but
continued to enjoy as far as his means allowed him the benefits of
that civilisation he so whole-heartedly condemned. Rousseau, a man
of genius, but also a diseased neuropath and something of a
scoundrel until hysterically converted, possessed that
extraordinary sincerity which stamps a period as a die stamps wax.
Raynal was only one of thousands who sincerely shared the Genevan's
honest belief in virtue and goodness without an enquiry into what
these terms really meant, and the ex-Jesuit was easily swept into
that stream of sensibility, fed by the tears of Clarissa and Julie,
which watered all intellectual France. In 1751 the Abb  Prvost,
himself the creator of a far different heroine, the enchanting
<i>Manon</i>, translated "Clarissa Harlowe," and all fashionable
Paris raved over the woes of the ill-used English Miss. French
praise of the masterpiece of Richardson passed all bounds of common
sense; Diderot, a frantic Anglophil, found the novel superior not
only to the Greek dramatists but also, oddly enough, to the
literary efforts of Moses, and Rousseau seized upon the idea, and
hanging round it his own peculiar graces, theories and sentiments,
produced <i>La Nouvelle Hlose,</i> that textbook of sensibility
which had such a powerful effect on thousands of readers.</p>

<p>Not only was Raynal exposed to these overwhelming
influences&mdash;those of the intellectual, political, and religious
agitators named the philosophers, and those of the sentimentalists,
which blended with and enervated these sterner teachings&mdash;but in
1762 Laurence Sterne visited Paris and gave a new twist to the
fashions of the moment. In the January of the previous year but
one, the first volume of <i>Tristram Shandy</i> had appeared&mdash;its
success has been described as delirious. Oliver Goldsmith thus
described the furore made by this bizarre production: "I bought
last season a piece that had no other merit on earth than one
hundred and ninety-five breaks, seventy-two ha-ha's, three good
things and a garter. And yet it played off and bounced and cracked
and made more sport than a firework."</p>

<p>And for a good many years Sterne, his reputation and his works,
did bounce and crack not only over his native country, but over
France.</p>

<p>When in 1764 he preached a sermon before the English Ambassador
in the Chapel of the Faubourg Saint-Honor, the entire strength of
the encyclopaedists gathered to gaze on this odd figure that the
Comte de Bissy was content to believe was that of the Court fool of
the English King. Raynal cultivated eagerly the acquaintance of
this original writer named by Voltaire <i>Le Rabelais
d'Angleterre,</i> and devoured with the zest common to his
countrymen Frnais' translation of "The Sentimental Journey," which
appeared after the translation of "Tristram Shandy" in 1769. <i>Le
Voyage Sentimental</i> proved instantly acceptable to the French
and ran into edition after edition, something like seventy having
appeared up to the present day. This odd book also was at once
imitated by some of those clever writers who never seem to have an
original idea, but who cannot take pen from paper when once they
have an original model. After all, it was easy to set off from
anywhere to anywhere, noting all the whimsical, pathetic incidents
by the way, shedding more tears than ink and making copious use of
the tricks of style so difficult to originate, so facile to
copy&mdash;and thus there were journeys here, there and everywhere by
travellers who never failed to find virtue in distress or some
ill-treated animal in need of help.</p>

<p>When Sterne returned to England in 1765 he made the acquaintance
of the fascinating Elisa Draper, a real woman, who was destined to
join two imaginary heroines, Clarissa and Julie, in popular favour
She had come to England to educate her two children and as some
relief from the company of one of those dull husbands too
frequently the lot of ladies of extreme sensibility&mdash;her
sentimental flirtations with Sterne were soon celebrated, and when
the "Letters to Elisa" were translated in 1776, the name of the
wife of the worthy Daniel Draper became as famous as that of Yorick
himself. Everything that fashion demanded this friendship had&mdash;the
virtue of Clarissa, the sensibility of Julie&mdash;"a love for ever
shadowed by an approaching eternal separation"&mdash;tears,
renunciation, and best of all, two death-beds. Sterne was known to
have long danced "a gallopade with death" and Elisa had
consumption, or something near enough for poetic purposes. She
languished in the most delicate throes of sensibility and when in
1776 she came to Paris, after a romantic flight from her unromantic
husband, she was frantically the vogue and captivated Raynal even
more decidedly than she had captivated Sterne, whose loss was
followed by some unpleasant passages with his family. At
thirty-five Elisa was dead. Nothing could have been more
suitable.</p>

<p>Edgar Allan Poe considered the death of a romantic, beautiful
woman the climax of poetry, and the opinion of the last quarter of
the eighteenth century considered an early end from decline the
climax of sentiment. The portrait of Elisa alive was not considered
so gratifying as Elisa's urn guarded by the weeping figures of
Benevolence and Genius, which adorned the cloisters of Bristol
Cathedral. The angelic creature snatched up&mdash;not to the despised
Christian heaven&mdash;but to the Elysian fields where Rousseau, with
powdered curls and works complete, is seen arriving in a
contemporary print, became all spiritual, a focus and a symbol for
the feeling of the time. What was she like? No portrait of her is
known. There must always be some curiosity about a woman who
contrives to impress intelligent men as celestial. The robust mind
of Thackeray found her almost as intolerable as the dead ass of the
journey that so roused his exasperation, and entertained doubts
about the mental gifts that Raynal among others found so
dazzling.</p>

<p>Describing her sailing from Deal after the eternal farewells
with Sterne, Thackeray adds: "It was high time she went." He also
highly condemns Sterne's conduct in sneering behind her back at the
fair "Bramine" and her effusive epistles. Conduct caddish, no
doubt, but that does credit to Sterne's perception&mdash;though at the
cost of his manners. After all, a brilliant wit has some right to
play any silly fish who swallows his bait, and Elisa was, it may be
suspected, muddle-headed and flighty, a blue-stocking
<i>manque</i> who was never so well suited as when safely buried
under her flower-wreathed urn. She was, however, in the full flush
of her fame when Raynal, under these influences of the
Encyclopaedia and of Rousseau and Sterne, decided to contribute
some great work of his own to the torrent of books that flooded the
printing presses and disturbed the public mind. He had no great
gift for fiction, so he realised that it was hopeless to run
together a novel exploiting the sorrows of a pair of diseased,
virtuous, and frustrated lovers, or the travels of some meandering
idler susceptible to lame beggars, tender <i>grisettes,</i> and
dying donkeys; thus tested, Raynal took a heroic decision. He would
write a history of the new world, i.e. the whole universe save
Europe, in which he would show a hideous picture of the cruelties,
vanities, superstitions and corruptions of the Europeans as
compared to the wrongs and virtues of the noble savage, beloved and
extolled by Rousseau himself.</p>

<p>Along with these high moral lessons would be useful information
about the products of the new world, descriptions of the
civilisations of the East, an account of the great Trading
Companies, and a narration of all the voyages of adventure and
discovery that had led to the conquest of the new world by the old
world. Raynal felt that such a work would have both the attraction
of novelty and the <i>cachet</i> of fashion, and he was annoyed
with a friend who, on hearing of his project, exclaimed: "That will
mean fifteen years' hard work!"</p>

<p>Raynal had other ideas; he wanted not the slow-coming, often
posthumous fame of the scholar or the historian, but the quick
applause and lavish fees that are too often the reward of the
tricks of the cheapjack. In about a year he produced a work to
which he gave the impossible title "Philosophic and Political
History of the Factories and the Commerce of the Europeans in the
Indies." As it was useless to hope for a French licence, this book
was published in the home of the free press, the Hague, in 1770. It
was issued anonymously and was in fact the work of many hands&mdash;a
symposium gathered from Raynal's friends. Most of the
<i>philosophes</i> were, in plain terms, free-lance journalists and
pamphleteers, even hack-writers who could turn their brilliant pens
to any subject that came their way.</p>

<p>Raynal, then, had no difficulty in gathering from them various
articles on topical subjects, or little historical sketches drawn
from books of travel, which he strung together with some of his own
reflections and observations, and interspersed with notes gathered
from practical people who cared little about the rights of man, the
moral law, the noble savage, or Elisa, but who were able to give
very lucid descriptions of the pepper, camomile, or coco-nut tree,
the trading stations on the Malabar coast or the climate of
Batavia, together with a fair idea of the profits to be made from
the growing and importing of such useful articles as tobacco, tea,
and indigo. Among the better-known contributors to this medley
French critics number Diderot, d'Holbach, Grimm, Thomas, Debuc, and
that fascinating Comte de Guibert, whose manly charms drove the
muse of the Encyclopaedia, Mlle de Lespinasse, to a modishly dismal
death and roused the youthful ardours of Madame de Stael.</p>

<p>What share each contributor had in this compilation, how much
Raynal wrote himself, and how many passages came from the pens of
obscure traders, sea captains, and shopkeepers, can never be known,
nor is it an important question since there is no matter in the
four volumes worth disputing. It is usually conceded, however, that
the rhetorical passages, diatribes against tyranny, etc., which
made the book so successful, were written either by Raynal himself
or by Diderot. This piece of energetic book-making was instantly
successful, as specious work so often is; thousands of copies
flowed into France and handsome sums of money into the pockets of
Raynal. If any of this money was passed on to his numerous and
often needy collaborators, we do not know&mdash;it is permitted to hope
so.</p>

<p>The triumph of this odd book was not altogether undeserved; it
was nicely in the vogue, though not an imitation of Sterne, it was,
on a large scale, a sentimental journey and gave abundant
opportunity for the shedding of those tears and the heaving of
those sighs that every educated person was so eager to shed and to
heave. There might not be any distressed asses found on these
travels, but there were any number of noble savages, and there were
some very bold, up-to-date outbursts against superstition and
tyranny, as the philosophers termed Christianity and Monarchy.</p>

<p>There was also something new about the point of view taken by
Raynal and his assistants, that the various conquests of the East
by the West were not glorious enterprises conducted by dauntless
heroes, but mere money-grubbing schemes exploited by unscrupulous
financiers and carried out by bloodthirsty brigands. It is not on
record that the book influenced any persons to forgo profits from
shares in Eastern trade, or to deny themselves any of the comforts
and luxuries so cruelly wrested from the oppressed inhabitants of
the new world, but as far as talk and scribbling went Raynal had
thousands of converts; the last touch of useful publicity was given
when the French Parliament condemned the book. So encouraging was
his success that he resolved to bring out a greatly enlarged
edition, and with this end in view visited England, the
Netherlands, the Dutch and English Indies, collecting information
likely to be useful to him, and was well received everywhere.</p>

<p>On his return to Paris he again met Elisa Draper&mdash;whose
acquaintance he had made in Bombay&mdash;wept with her over Sterne, and
then lamented (1778) the untimely loss of the lady herself. Soon
after he went to Geneva, where he was safe from the French police,
and saw his second edition through the press. It was a sumptuous
affair in nine volumes, with plates and a volume of maps by the
famous M. Bonne, after Moreau Lejeune. Raynal's name was attached
to this edition, together with his portrait&mdash;"theatrical and not
like" said Grimm spitefully. Raynal was much feted in Switzerland,
where he was regarded at his own valuation as an apostle of
liberty; he erected at his own expense a monument to three Swiss
patriots, Frst, Melchthal, and Stauffacher, and it was only the
captious that ventured to remark that he had placed his own bust on
the obelisk. On his way home he stopped at Lyon, where the Academy
made him an honorary member. In return for this distinction he
founded a prize&mdash;600 livres annually&mdash;for the best essay on the
difficult subject: "Has the discovery of America been really
beneficial to mankind?"</p>

<p>The second edition of "The Two Indies" created a furore, and had
for years a deep influence on sensitive, excitable, and superficial
minds; the nine volumes were packed with inflammatory matter, the
emphatic and pungent statements of those startling half-truths that
dazzle and mislead all but the most steady intellects. Rousseau,
Sterne, Elisa were as much the vogue in 1780 as they had been in
1770, and the insertion of the famous "loge d'Elisa" in volume
II, helped to make the <i>Deux Indes</i> extremely popular. This
famous piece of hyperbole is supposed to have been written by
Diderot, but appeared again and again over Raynal's name in
editions of Sterne's "Letters" and "The Sentimental Journey."</p>

<p>Guibert, who had contributed to this medley himself, celebrated
the virtues of Mlle de Lespinasse under the name of Elisa&mdash;when
death had removed poor Julie's exasperating attentions&mdash;and the two
<i>motifs,</i> both from Sterne, of Elisa and the dead donkey, were
combined by Mlle de Lespinasse herself in a fragment she wrote in
imitation of Yorick.</p>

<p>This odd little composition, the first of many such spurious
episodes in the travels of the arch-sentimentalist, illustrates
very nicely the delicacy of the difference between pathos and
bathos, which Raynal never understood. It also shows the now almost
incredible mental tone of the society where the <i>Deux hides</i>
was such a notable success.</p>

<p>"A milk woman has one cow, it falls sick and she sits up all
night with it: 'Art thou suffering, my Blanche? Alas, I share thy
pains and cannot comfort thee!' She offers the animal bread, which
it cannot take, and dropping into the popular mode of speech,
exclaims: 'O Providence, canst thou look down on this and not
interfere?' Providence taking no notice, Blanche dies, and the
dairy-maid, weeping, relates the tragedy to the noble lady whom she
serves; she weeps in her turn and promises to buy her cream&mdash;which,
unfortunately, is not good&mdash;and tells the incident to the
traveller; he weeps also and hastens to write up the tale for
Elisa, who will, he is sure, also shed tears."</p>

<p>After this we have, in Verne's travesty, the famous <i>L'homme
au Mouton,</i> an individual found wandering with a lamb, a
butcher's assistant, who had lost his position through refusing to
kill it; the traveller, much moved, offers money, through excess of
sensibility, not to the man, but to the lamb. In this same book is
the even more touching episode of the cats which, fastened down
with outstretched tails, made a living harpsichord, each animal
emitting a different yowl when his tail was pulled&mdash;one was begged
off by the traveller, who declared that the purrs of the grateful
animal were worth all the hollow praises of the false
multitude.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"The self-approving hour whole worlds outweighs<br>
Of stupid starers and of loud huzzas."</p>

<br>

<p>Of the same temper was that other sentimental traveller, who,
losing his temper with the servant who cleaned his shoes badly, was
smitten with such remorse that his bitter tears washed his footwear
clean without any further trouble.</p>

<p>Raynal, to whom this atmosphere of sensibility, moralising, and
sentiment seems to have been very congenial, ventured on more
important objects for his pity than dead donkeys, cows with the
colic, rebuked servants, or ill-treated cats and dogs; he ventured,
indeed, on large themes, and boldly dealt with large issues&mdash;the
slave trade, the illegal, unjust seizure of the East by the West,
the greed, cruelty, and corruption of priests, merchants, kings,
soldiers, statesmen, from the day that Vasco da Gama sailed on his
adventurous voyage; in short "Man's inhumanity to man" was the main
argument of Raynal's book and what made it so popular. His case
was, at a first glance, unanswerable; he argued that war, conquest,
slavery, superstition, moneymaking by unfair means, all oppression
of the weak by the strong, were evil.</p>

<p>Portuguese, Dutch, English, French, and Spaniards came severally
under his lash, for he judged their various trading and colonising
expeditions to have been but so many thievish raids, led by
murderers and charlatans. He lost no opportunity of violently
attacking the class that most raised his wrath&mdash;the rulers, secular
and religious, who, he contended, were responsible for centuries of
horror and woe. In the oppressed he found much virtue; China, of
which huge empire he seems to have had but a slight knowledge,
roused his profound admiration; he considered it a model state,
though perhaps the Chinese would hardly have felt flattered by what
he thought a great compliment&mdash;that some of their philosophers were
older than, and equal to, Descartes and Locke.</p>

<p>India, Hindustan, he treated with respect, if not with much
understanding, and those unhappy people vaguely known as "savages"
had all his sympathy. It should be noted that, despite the title,
the second edition deals with nearly the whole of the then known
world, so that Raynal's survey is necessarily cursory&mdash;even with
all his industry and the number of his collaborators it was
impossible for him to deal in detail with such a subject, but he
did his best to drive home his main contention&mdash;the theory of the
rights of man and the practice of the wrongs of man. This was
rather different from the tone of the previous travellers' tales.
Europeans had hitherto regarded the rest of the world as full of
matter for profit, or offering objects of curiosity&mdash;that childlike
curiosity which considers everything odd that is unfamiliar.</p>

<p>But Raynal's line of thought was very much in the fashion, and
was at once as popular with the intellectuals and their followers
as it was distasteful to those in authority. Raynal himself earned
fame and money and was much feted in Paris, where the "&Eacute;loge to
Elisa" in volume II put the crowning touch to that lady's fame.
Slipped in between matter-of-fact accounts of the trading stations
on the Malabar coast, this tearful eulogy may well be the work of
Diderot, who boasted he was the greatest "weeper" of his time.
Raynal, or Diderot, whichever was the writer of this tribute, was
as sure of his own immortality as Shakespeare when penning the
sonnets&mdash;no brass should outlive his powerful prose, and in
consequence the name of Elisa's birthplace "will not be obliterated
from the memory of man." For all time Britons would say with
conscious pride: "Elisa was English."</p>

<p>The writer and Elisa had wept over Sterne together; if Sterne
had survived, he would have wept over Elisa, and if both had
survived the author, both would have watered his grave with
tears&mdash;indeed, "My tears will flow for Elisa as long as I
live."</p>

<p>The end of the eulogy brings in the eternal fugue&mdash;the writer,
under Elisa's inspiration, vows to her shade in Highest Heaven,
"never to write a line unworthy of her, and always to serve the
cause of Humanity, of Truth, of Liberty."</p>

<p>This brings us to the core of Raynal's work, of his importance,
and touches on a large question that much exercises the minds of
literary critics at the present day. We have glanced at Raynal's
work as a successful, clever piece of book-making, an example of a
literary fashion, as interesting in connection with Laurence
Sterne; let us finally consider it as the very effective effort of
a social reformer&mdash;"a fanatic for humanity" who helped to goad a
nation into a long series of revolts against established
authority&mdash;revolts that began in an idealism that Raynal thoroughly
approved and were soon degraded into an anarchy that he regarded
with alarm and horror. Raynal was the "oracle" of many of the
ideologues of 1789 and was considered not only the violent foe of
the abuses of the old system, but the prophet of that new era which
numerous ardent spirits really believed was dawning at the end of
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>While many of Raynal's <i>dicta</i> contain obvious truths,
while much of his moral indignation is, no doubt, as sincere as
forceful, his violence of expression is more notable than his
profundity of thought, and it is difficult to realise, when reading
these melodramatic cliches, now so well-worn, how seriously they
were taken when they were fresher by large numbers of well-meaning
people, and how this book, and such books as this, many no better
and some worse, swayed the thought and directed the aims of a whole
generation. This opens the subject, at present much discussed, of
the desirability of a writer's concerning himself with the moral
and social problems of his own times. We have often been told,
earnestly and eloquently, that all authors, not only those occupied
with serious subjects, but even novelists, poets and playwrights,
should wholly and passionately occupy themselves with the
perplexities, reforms, politics, and morals of their own
generation. Indeed, some critics hold these views so decidedly that
they tend to ignore or to dismiss as mere "escape," romance, or
day-dreaming, any book that does not deal with some disturbing
aspect of modernity, which, we are gravely assured, is so much more
important and so much more complex than any other period has ever
been.</p>

<p>Thus urged and fortified, modern writers, many in good faith,
many out of opportunism, pour out books that, under different
disguises, fiction, verse, history, what you will, are in plain
fact pamphleteering, full of bitter indignation against existing
abuses, of contentious argument, of idealistic theories, of some
kind of propaganda, or the exposition of some question of the
moment. And still we are told that this is not enough, and that no
one should put pen to paper who is not prepared to contribute to
some question of the day. This makes one turn with relief to music
and architecture, which must be forms of art beyond the power to
scold, preach, or persuade&mdash;since as some noble wit is supposed to
have said of the Order of the Garter: "there is no damned merit"
about them. Should there be, in this connection, merit about
literature? Is it the function of the man of letters to concern
himself as a moralist or reformer with the thousand perplexities,
intricacies, bafflements, rights and wrongs of the society in which
he finds himself? Is the professional man of letters, with his
facility of expression, his quick observation, his power of drama,
his ability to rouse emotion, his lively feeling&mdash;with all his
gifts, more or less brilliant as the case may be&mdash;is he best
employed in meddling in matters that belong to the true
philosophers, the preachers, the men of action? It might surely be
argued that he is not&mdash;that if he is a philosopher he should
meditate until he has something that it is worth while to teach; if
he is a reformer he should find other means than the pen of
bringing about reforms, that if he has any constructive ability in
any direction that is likely to benefit humanity, let him find an
active outlet for that ability. And if he be none of these things,
but a writer&mdash;scribbler or genius&mdash;let him mind his own business
and leave propaganda, no matter how worthy, alone.</p>

<p>No doubt many abuses have been corrected by the efforts of
literary people&mdash;yet one feels that those who have righted and are
righting wrong, grievances, and miseries, do not write much about
their ideals&mdash;they have not time. Often, too, the writer attacks
some wrong already decaying through the efforts of quiet folk who
have made no fuss, and gets credit for knocking over a toppling
idol. Granted, however, that much good has resulted from propaganda
literature, it is obvious that much mischief has been done. Lofty
idealism, stern rules of conduct, enthusiastic theories of absolute
right and wrong, severe indictments of the mistakes and crimes of
mankind, are easily flung on paper, easily read and discussed. The
difficulty is to make them practicable. What workable plan of
reform ever came from men who merely talked and wrote and never
tried their hands at putting their ideals into practice? These
paper statesmen, these pen and ink idealists, entirely lack
cynicism, experience, and what Cavour named <i>le tact de chose
possible</i>&mdash;the sense of what it is possible to do with given
materials.</p>

<p>To admire Rousseau's moral law, his "back to nature," or the
noble savage, is reasonable enough&mdash;but to try to force these
ideals on a society where it is not possible to put them into
execution, and where they are detestable to thousands, may be
extremely dangerous. "No one," said Oliver Cromwell, "goes so far
as he who knows not where he is going," and windy revolutionaries
like Raynal, who could give no clear directions because they knew
of none, soon found themselves swept into chaos. Raynal was not a
creative artist, or even a man of great talent, so perhaps he is
not a fair example of the question how far an artist should concern
himself with morals and politics&mdash;but his once-famous book is a
notable example of the powerful effect an author can have on his
times, and he lived to wish that when he had written a history of
the two Indies he had really written a history and left the
maddening questions of liberty, humanity, and truth alone.</p>

<p>Men of far greater ability than Raynal had wasted their talents
in these elusive causes and had succeeded only in stimulating the
crank and the fanatic and in coining catch-words for lunatics and
scoundrels. Absolute art offers no support, supplies no war cries
for such as these&mdash;but in its serene detachment it offers
inspiration and consolation to the truly great leader. Those men,
who with the truly sincere leader have indeed battled with the real
work of the world, have been upheld and sustained by the majesty
and beauty, the charm and dignity, of abstract art; to take a banal
example, General Wolfe, according to the anecdote, said that he
would rather have written Gray's Elegy than taken Quebec&mdash;he would
not have said that if Gray had expended his forces in writing a
book to teach professional statesmen the ethics of government and
professional soldiers the moralities and sentiments proper to their
situation. All shades of good and evil form the material of the
artist&mdash;from them he creates his own world from which we draw
consolation, or inspiration, or delight&mdash;when he descends to
meddlesome propaganda, to moralising or preaching, the less our
consolation, our inspiration, our delight&mdash;the more that <i>cosa
divina</i> which passes nature and becomes art is soiled and
tainted.</p>

<p>It may also be imputed to Raynal and the school to which he
belonged that they helped, perhaps unconsciously, to destroy the
aristocratic ideal in life and the classic ideal in art. A false
classicism, founded largely on the exploits of Brutus and the works
of Plutarch, was, of course, a mania at the close of the eighteenth
century in France, but the genuine ideals of classicism disappeared
before the overwhelming wave of romanticism, as the genuine ideals
of aristocracy disappeared before the ideals of the bourgeoisie or
the mob.</p>

<p>And both by classicism and aristocracy, I take it, are meant
that dignity, balance, repose, form and sense of culture&mdash;that
restraint and good taste absent in both the romantic and realistic
schools of writing, which swing from one extreme to another and
produce the same effect. It is notable that the wildly romantic
school that followed the era of sentiment and virtue&mdash;George Sand
claimed Rousseau as her master&mdash;produced much the same effect on
susceptible members of the public as does the extremely cynical,
agnostic school of writers so prominent to-day. Excess of
romanticism, a longing for escape into impossible conditions of
bliss, produced disgust, despair, suicide. A performance of De
Vigny's "Chatterton" was considered fiat if some youthful member of
the audience did not attempt suicide when the stage poet took
poison. Modern cynicism produces the same illusion of frustration
and futility&mdash;instead of the romantic's nostalgia for the
unrealisable dream we have the assertion that the dream is merely
indigestion&mdash;and in each case existence, to the sensitive, seems
undermined. Surely the remedy lies in some return, both in life and
in letters, to that classic or aristocratic attitude which combines
idealism with sanity, romance with intelligence, and finds in the
heroic attitude that golden mean which saves us from both absurdity
and despair.</p>

<p>Some outline of the dangers ahead was perceived by those in
power who tried, often clumsily enough, to suppress the works of
such men as Raynal; Louis XVI, a sincerely religious man, was
profoundly shocked by "The Two Indies," the book was again
condemned by the Parliament of Paris, 1781, and this time burnt by
the hangman. This did not prevent the increased, if secret, sales
of the book, but Raynal judged it wise to flee to Spa.</p>

<p>The next few years of his life the old man spent in trying to
obtain the patronage of rulers whom some might have considered fit
models for the tyrants he had so violently denounced&mdash;Frederic of
Prussia and Catherine of Russia. The King held off; he had resented
some passages in "The Two Indies," but the Empress was pleased to
add the ex-Jesuit to her collection of curiosities. In 1791 Raynal
returned to France in the belief that a golden age which he had
helped to ensure was about to begin&mdash;like so many ardent spirits,
he was enthusiastic over the events of 1789 and honestly thought
that those theories that had worked out so well on paper were being
smoothly put into easy practice. He was soon and sharply
disillusioned, and alarmed and disgusted by the spectacle of the
break-up of that society he had so sternly condemned, addressed a
letter of grim rebuke to the National Assembly. In this action the
old man showed himself brave, honest, and a true prophet. In
trenchant terms he pointed out the horrors of anarchy, which would
be attendant on a King without power, an army without leaders, a
government without authority. He had the rare courage to admit that
he had reconsidered many of his theories&mdash;he had realised that in
government it is always a question not of the ideal, but of the
possible. He believed that he had some influence with the
revolutionaries whom his book had done so much to encourage or
inspire, and hoped to use that influence to check a headlong rush
into a national catastrophe. It was too late.</p>

<p>When the letter was read there was some timid applause from the
moderates&mdash;but the majority voted the old man senile and the debate
continued.</p>

<p>Raynal was, however, unmolested; he survived the reign of terror
he had predicted and died, obscure and poor, in 1796.</p>

<p>A very brief survey of volume I of the Geneva edition of "The
Two Indies" will provide a fair sample of this book, which now
seems harmless to the point of tedium, but which once was so
exciting and so powerful.</p>

<p>In the first few pages Raynal makes the assertion that he has
taken no little pains to obtain information, and that he would, if
needful, have gone to the Equator or the North Pole to consult some
competent authority.</p>

<p>With this in mind we may read on page six a description of the
lost Atlantis and the obvious moral lesson of "the vanity of human
wishes." This is followed by an account of the discovery of Madeira
by the Portuguese&mdash;it was originally covered with forests, which
were destroyed in a fire that burnt for seven years&mdash;after that the
soil became extremely fertile and produced the <i>Malvoisie</i>
grape. After some details of this wine trade we have some eloquent
passages devoted to India, Hindustan, Arabia, and Persia&mdash;"the
richest and most beautiful continent in the world, with the most
superb climate, and inhabited by the most ancient race." Some of
the mighty monuments of India provoke the reflection: "These are
the <i>dbris</i> of an immense edifice, built by the first
civilised people in the world, who possessed a sublime morality, a
profound philosophy, a very refined form of government."</p>

<p>We pass to the Portuguese trading settlements on the Malabar
coast, with the pretty list of amber, pearls, ivory, porcelain,
silver, aromatics, varnishes, stuffs of silk and cotton and other
objects of trade. On page 141 is a description of the Egyptian
trade with India, which has a charming fairy-tale air in the
picture of the preparation of incense: "Most valuable of perfumes,
for the honour of the gods and the delight of Kings," followed by a
clear, precise account, evidently by a botanist, of the precious
red aloe, after which we have a sudden attack on contemporary
Europe. "England torn by the interests of her Independence, France
by the interests of her masters, Germany by those of religion,
Italy by the pretensions of a tyrant and an impostor. Covered with
combatants and fanatics Europe resembles a sick man who, in a
moment of delirium, tears open his veins and bleeds to death."</p>

<p>This confusion of crimes, of ambitions, causes us to question
Rousseau's claim&mdash;"Man is born free."</p>

<p>A history of Turkey gives occasion for some more bitter
comments: "The Turks murder their masters, but never think to
change their government," together with an attack on
Christianity&mdash;"which builds the Throne on the Altar."</p>

<p>In referring to "the wealth of Ispahan," Raynal gives us a rich
vignette of the city with carpeted streets, silken sunblinds
veiling the balconies, aromatic plants in vases of gold and
porcelain set among Persian vines&mdash;"the most beautiful women and
the softest music of Asia." The coco-nut tree in the Moluccas is
given three pages of earnest description and we are told that the
fruit was "the manna of the desert."</p>

<p>The eulogy of China follows, then we pass to a history of the
Dutch nation and the voyages of Cornelius Houtman, a description of
the Spice Islands and the spices and their uses; camphor, we note,
helps to make fireworks and to disperse tumours; then we are
introduced to the Hottentots, Raynal's <i>beau idal</i> of the
noble savage&mdash;"Fly, savages, fly! The Europeans menace your liberty
and your innocence!"</p>

<p>There is a pleasant picture of Cape Town, with a thousand
houses, tree-bordered canal, public gardens, and forty thousand
well-treated slaves; a less pleasant picture of Batavia with its
deadly climate, constant burning of perfumes to disperse the
malarious air, and the voluptuous life that corrupted the sturdy
Dutch. Never anywhere else could so many women, sparkling with
diamonds, be seen riding in golden sedan chairs attended by
hundreds of slaves&mdash;indeed, in 1758 there was a law passed against
the wearing of diamonds.</p>

<p>A pretty detail is the account, some pages further on, of the
blue and milk-white nightingales that dwell on the Cochin China
coast, and whose nests, made of sea-foam and <i>frai du
poisson,</i> are much valued for food. There is some more
moralising on the uselessness of oaths, some more practical notes
on trade with China, then the first volume comes to an end with an
attack on the Dutch for losing all their ancient republican
virtues: "Batavians, the destiny of a commercial nation is to be
rich, cowardly, corrupt, and subjugated. Ask of yourselves if you
are not all this?"</p>

<p>The volume is completed by the accounts of the Dutch East Indian
Company from 1720-1729.</p>

<p>The dust has long lain thick on Guillaume Thomas Raynal and his
work&mdash;it has not been easy, or perhaps useful, to disturb it; as
one allows it to settle again one thinks, with an irrelevancy
worthy of the good abbe himself, not of his labours and his
moralising, his platitudes and his eloquence, his influence, his
errors, but of the hooped and powdered ghost with the oval face and
vivid eyes, last seen in 1830, I believe, gliding over the verandah
of Belvedere House overlooking Bombay Harbour&mdash;the ghost of Elisa
Draper.</p>

<p class="first">
EDWARD YOUNG, a lesser star of the Augustan age of English
letters, is one of those writers, a sufficient number, whose names
are familiar, whose lines are quoted, but whose works are seldom
read and less seldom reprinted. Though the name of Young figures
nearly as often as the names of Shakespeare and Pope under quoted
lines, I know of no edition of "Night Thoughts"* later than 1866;
and even by that date the reputation of Young, once considered by
serious critics to be on a level with that of Milton, had
considerably dwindled, and he was praised more for the
unexceptional morality of his views than for the dubious qualities
of his verse. George Eliot attacked him both as a man and as a
poet, and gave the final blow to his diminished fame, and now,
after so much glory and so much neglect, he takes his place as a
minor poet and a rich source for the discovery of neat platitudes
expressed with a quotable flourish.</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night-Thoughts"
target="_blank">[*See <i>Wikipedia</i>]</a></p>

<p>It may, however, be conceded that "Night Thoughts," both in
itself and in the effect it produced when published, is one of the
curiosities of our literature, and that a work perhaps more widely
read and more influential in Europe than any English poem of the
eighteenth century deserves a brief attention&mdash;a work, too, that
has been praised by such diverse critics as Dr. Johnson, Paine, and
Bulwer Lytton.</p>

<p>"Night Thoughts" was also in its time a staff and prop for many
afflicted and bereaved people, who found in the sonorous,
passionate lines a hope and consolation that atoned for their heavy
gloom and morbid melancholy.</p>

<p>The life of Young was not of particular interest, though he
moved among the renowned and familiar figures of eighteenth-century
London; the only son of a Court Chaplain, he was educated at
Winchester and New College, obtained a Law Fellowship at All Souls,
came to the capital, mingled with the most lively society of the
time, wrote a few very inferior poems, some plays not so inferior,
satires of distinctive merit, and hunted diligently for patronage
without notable success, for the only great man induced to give him
a pension, the Duke of Wharton, went bankrupt soon after. With his
eye on the living of Welwyn in Hertford, which was in the gift of
his College, Young disappointed in his dangling after the muses,
took Holy Orders, became rector of Welwyn, and despite his most
strenuous endeavours, never achieved any post more imposing, though
he had been appointed one of the Royal Chaplains. He had married
the Lady Elizabeth Lee, a grand-daughter of Charles II, and did not
lack for influential friends, including the Duchess of Portland,
Prior's "noble, lovely, little Peggy," but preferment lagged on the
way, and the utmost Court favour Young ever obtained was the
position of reader to the Princess of Wales, when he was too blind
to discern print and too infirm to travel to London.</p>

<p>He was, however, tolerably comfortable at Welwyn, where, after
the death of his wife, he was zealously attended by a redoubtable
housekeeper, a staid, discreet, sober gentlewoman, Miss Hallows
(who contrived to estrange him from his only son), and where he had
all the work of the Parish done for him by a curate on 20 a
year&mdash;hardly a generous stipend, since Welwyn was worth three
hundred, the readership as much, and Young possessed other means,
not, as the same curate remarked bitterly, spending half of his
income, and being a "self-willed old man, full of trouble."</p>

<p>At Welwyn, after the loss of the Lady Elizabeth, his
stepdaughter and her husband, Young wrote his famous poem, and
there, in this rustic retreat, after a life varied by visits to the
Wells, to Bath and to Bulstrode, the Duke of Portland's mansion, he
died at a considerable age, leaving a reputation for sanctity and
wisdom, and a voluminous correspondence, mostly concerned with
mundane affairs and intrigues for preferment. He certainly merited
a bishopric as much as any of his contemporaries, and it is
regrettable that he should have been reduced to such undignified
"yelps and whines," as one critic calls his appeals, for
advancement; but when flattering a patron was the one means of
securing notice it can hardly be severely condemned, and fulsome as
are Young's letters and dedications, they are no worse than those
perpetrated by greater men. It was the age of the patron, and as
now authors have to secure the attention of the many, then they had
to secure the attention of the one&mdash;the appeal was more personal,
more painful, but the intention, and often the method, the same.
The antics performed at present in the name of publicity may seem
two hundred years hence as absurd as do now verses that declare
middle-aged peers to be Jupiter and Apollo combined, and depict
stout, homely royal ladies being drawn upwards into seventh heavens
by Lord Chancellors with purpling wings and robes of the Garter.
Edward Young, witty as he was reputed to be, had no sense of
humour, and, as Swift remarked, found no great difficulty in
"flattering knaves" sooner than "lose his pension," though the Dean
of St. Patrick was hardly the person who should have permitted
himself this gibe.</p>

<p>Young's private character was, in the parlance of those days,
"respectable"; if he did not present much to admire in his conduct,
he caused no scandal, and the good advice he offered had hardly any
limits; there are guarded hints of "wildness" in his youth, and a
brief indulgence in the pleasures of the town in the very doubtful
company of the Duke of Wharton, then, however, not revealed in his
true colours. Pope says unkindly that "Young was the sport of
peers," and Dr. Johnson allowed him genius, but denied him common
sense; whatever these early follies, Young soon extricated himself
from any unpleasant consequences, and was eager to repudiate the
Duke of Wharton when that brilliant young man came, with such
edification to the moralists, to that latter end prophesied for all
who have the hardihood to flourish like the green bay tree.</p>

<p>By the time that Young entered Holy Orders at the age of
forty-seven he was able to support his office with dignity and
decorum, and never failed to champion the orthodox Anglicanism of
his day by sermons, poems, letters, and excursions into the
questions of the moment, as when he rushed into verse to slash his
old acquaintance, Voltaire, for <i>Candide</i>:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Why close a life so justly famed<br>
With such bold trash as this?<br>
This for renown! yes, such as makes<br>
Obscurity a bliss!"</p>

<br>

<p>and when he roused himself, in his extreme old age, to write
"The Centaur not Fabulous," a counterblast to Bolingbroke's
posthumous atheism. Nor is there any reason to doubt that his
copious eloquence in the cause of Christianity (as understood in
the eighteenth century) was sincere; nor to undervalue his belief
in the immortality of the soul because he was careful of the
comforts of the body; nor to doubt his faith in the next world
because he was solicitous of a good place in this. He appears to
have had a passion for preaching as another of his age might have a
passion for collecting coins or growing tulips, and to have found
the propounding of moral axioms more absorbing than the most
agreeable of pleasures. He delighted in laying down rules of
conduct, admonishing wickedness, pointing out the brevity of human
existence, the approach of the Judgment Day and the certainty of
Hell for the disbeliever; and he dwelt on these subjects with a
copiousness that caused the most well-trained congregation to nod
and the most austere of divines to murmur that the good doctor
"overflowed his banks." A sermon he preached before King George II
caused such obvious restiveness on the part of His Majesty that the
disappointed Young burst into tears; this unfortunate episode may
have been the cause of his lack of preferment. Nor is this the only
incident that makes us suspect that Young, for all his remarkable
gifts, was, on occasion, a bore; a great deal of his work is
certainly unreadable save as a curiosity or an exercise in
patience, and were it not for the first four "Nights" might be
deservedly consigned to a cabinet of curiosities.</p>

<p>But these poems and their influence are sufficiently remarkable
to warrant some attention from the student of literature.</p>

<p>The age in which Young lived was peculiarly rich in great and
nearly great writers. Pope, Addison, Steele, Swift, Johnson,
Fielding, Gay, Shenstone, and Richardson&mdash;Young's most intimate
friend&mdash;come at once to the mind, and at Winchester with the author
of the "Night Thoughts" was John Philips, who revived in "Cyder"
and "The Splendid Shilling" the Miltonic iambics, and at New
College with him was William Collins and Louis, the brother of
Colley Cibber, and the brothers Warton, one of whom, Joseph,
afterwards dedicated to Young his essay on Pope; Gray and
Goldsmith, Macpherson and Chatterton, were among the poets whose
careers were contemporary with the old age of Young, whose long
life stretched from the full blaze of Dryden, the neo-classic or
Augustan school, to the dawn of romanticism; with this transition
our poet was in some way concerned.</p>

<p>His earlier pieces are in no way valuable, but in his "Satires,"
which brought him in a considerable sum, he preceded Pope in this
genre, small character sketches in pompous, heroic couplets, full
of Latinisms, in which he held up well-known types to scorn; these
satiric pieces on the classic model followed Joseph Hall&mdash;the
saintly Bishop of Norwich&mdash;Donne and Dryden in their imitations of
Horace and Juvenal. The victims are, of course, as old as
humanity&mdash;the rake, the miser, the slut, the hypocrite&mdash;and though
neat and full of trenchant lines, the Satires do not pretend to be
poetry and can hardly be accepted as literature. The third Satire,
where he indulges in the old grievance of author against critic, is
the most amusing:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"'Your work is long,' the critic cries. 'Tis
true,<br>
And lengthens still to take in fools like you&mdash;<br>
Good authors damn'd have their revenge in this<br>
To see what wretches gain the praise they miss&mdash;"</p>

<br>

<p>And Young concludes with a spirited attack on the newspaper men
almost as trenchant as Pope's "There's nothing blackens like the
ink of fools":</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Critics on verse, as squibs on triumph wait,<br>
Proclaim the triumph and augment the state.<br>
Hot, envious, noisy, proud, the scribbling fry<br>
Burn, hiss, and bounce, waste paper, stink and die."</p>

<br>

<p>Young next tried for success on the Stage, and though he admired
Shakespeare and professed to wish to revive the noble virility of
the Elizabethan dramatists, he is more the disciple of Lee and
Otway, and was definitely influenced by the French classic school.
"Busiris" and "The Brother's Revenge" are fine examples of the
drama when "declamation raged, while passion slept"; everyone is in
a fury, shouting all others down, while there are "crimes gigantic
stalking through the gloom," vast emotions clash against one
another, heroines "go mad in white satin," villains gnash their
teeth, roll their eyes, heroes protest their heroism in pages of
blank verse.</p>

<p>"<i>Exit raving"</i> is the usual stage direction, and the whole
machinery of Heaven and Hell is provoked because two rococo
warriors are striving for the same pasteboard crown or the same
"fatal fair," whose icy virtue does not permit her to state a
preference; "loud sorrows howl, envenomed passions bite." There is
a certain grandiose flourish in the design and many rich beauties
in the detail, but the whole effect is as bombastic as a painting
by Verrio or Thornhill, and did not escape the ridicule even of
that baroque period; Young's tragedies provoked the satire of Henry
Fielding and Henry Carey (author of "Sally in Our Alley"); "Tom
Thumb" and "Chrononhotonthologos" exposed the ranting and
gesticulating of these beplumed and buskined tyrants; it was
difficult, however, to satirise such grotesques, and Bombardinian
appears more like the twin brother than the caricature of
Busiris.</p>

<p>Despite the wits, Young's plays were often revived and lasted
for a respectable period, and it must be admitted that they were at
least no worse than many dramas both in England and abroad that
were constantly played to admiring audiences. "Say it in thunder"
roared one of Young's characters in a line stolen from Mrs. Aphra
Beim, and the pert George Anne Bellamy, the actress, remarked that
one might as well add "in lightning" too, "thunder and lightning"
would have been no inapt name for this remarkable school of
neo-classic drama, already tinged by the disturbed gloom of the
coming romanticism.</p>

<p>When he took Orders, Young, with his eye on a bishopric, thought
it politic to cease these efforts to entertain the profane, and we
hear no more of his literary labours until 1742, when Dodsley
published at the famous sign of Tully's Head in St. James's Street
a slim volume at 1<i>s</i>., with blue paper covers showing a
clergyman seated among the tombs, meditating by the light of the
moon, and entitled "Night Thoughts, or the Complaint."</p>

<p>Young, now an elderly, a bereaved and a disappointed man, was
the anonymous author, and it was in Welwyn, the scene of the death
of his beloved wife and the extinction of his worldly hopes, that
he had composed the only poem of his that is likely to be
remembered.</p>

<p>Several influences had combined to inspire Young. He was of a
melancholy temperament; at Winchester he had pondered over the
epitaphs in the cloisters and worked by the light of a candle in a
skull, and he had been shocked by the loss of several people dear
to him; the state of medicine then gave everyone an opportunity of
noting the uncertainty and brevity of life. He had also been roused
by Pope's "Essay on Man," that brilliant patchwork founded on the
new metaphysics of Leibnitz, then displacing those of Descartes.
The German had corrected the Cartesian "fundamental ideas" of man
to "fundamental faculties" of man. This theory, tinged with the
philosophies of Bolingbroke, had inspired "The Essay on Man," which
preached a practical optimism that, if it did not quite reach
Voltaire's ironic "all for the best in the best of all possible
worlds," at least tried to prove that it was as well to make the
most of this existence since we were sure of no other, leaving the
mysteries we cannot fathom in the hands of a no doubt merciful God.
Pope, in the main, as far as he was consistent at all, preached the
pagan philosophy:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Enjoy your life, my brother,<br>
Is gray old Reason's song;<br>
One has so little while to live<br>
And one is dead so long."</p>

<br>

<p>Such a doctrine, however piously expressed, seemed to Young
little short of blasphemy, and in "Night Thoughts" he passionately
proclaimed that life was either a series of errors or a series of
penances, and that the unescapable result was in the first case
Hell and in the second Heaven. The main thesis of the poem was the
immortality of the soul, and the main novelty the introduction of
the personal note, so long absent from English verse; obscurely and
under feigned names the poet lamented his own losses and drew his
own consolations. For these two reasons and because of a glowing
grandeur in the imagery, the poem was immediately successful and
the melancholic, romantic school fairly launched. Though the
matter, fear of death and hope of a future existence, scorn of
folly and praise of virtue, was as old as human thought, it had
never been quite presented in this way before in English verse. The
Elizabethan attitude, for example, on one of the main themes of
Young&mdash;contemplation of death&mdash;is different indeed, as is expressed
in the stately impersonal lines of Francis Beaumont:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"The Wind blows out, the Bubble dies;<br>
The Spring entombed in Autumn lies;<br>
The Dew's dried up; the Star is shot;<br>
The Flight is past, and Man forgot,"</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
which seem an echo of the Psalmist's "For he considered that
they were but flesh; and that they were even as a wind that passeth
away and cometh not again." The lovely resignation of George
Herbert in "I made a Posie," where he says:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Farewell, dear flowers, sweetly your time ye spent,<br>
Fit, while ye lived, for smell or ornament<br>
And after death for cures.<br>
I follow straight without complaint or grief,<br>
Since if my scent be good, I care e not if<br>
It be as short as yours,"</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
the noble submission of Raleigh in his "Oh, eloquent, just and
mighty Death" in his prose, and "Even such is time" in his verse,
to mention but two other poets who touched these universal themes,
were different indeed from the flowing rhapsodies of Young; and the
grand meditations of Thomas Browne and the classic calm of
Montaigne's "May death find me, not unmindful of his dart, but
tending my cabbages" found no echo in the exclamatory periods of
the rector of Welwyn, when he surveyed "Earth's melancholy map."
Thomas Parnell, vicar of Finglass and friend of Pope, who died in
1718, had already written "A Night Piece on Death," but it had not
had much effect and can hardly be regarded as a forerunner of
Young. There was, too, a hundred years before Young, the "Death" of
Charles Drelincourt, famous from Defoe's <i>Mrs. Veal</i> preface,
but the French minister's work has not the inspiration of the
English poet.</p>

<p>The design of the poem was complete in four "Nights," but Young,
like many another, was tempted by the vogue he had himself created
to outrun his own inspiration&mdash;he expanded the poem to nine
"Nights," and the last five are of little value, and in parts dull
indeed; but it was reasonable that he should wish to continue his
own vein, for it had instantly been exploited by others&mdash;Robert
Blair produced "The Grave," Harvey "Meditations among the Tombs,"
where he left the churchyard as not sufficiently gloomy and
descended to the vaults to compose his diatribes, which are written
in an ornate prose in Young's style. Churchyards promised to be as
fashionable a vogue as routs or masques, and skulls and cross-bones
as popular as ribbons and laces.</p>

<p>"Clarissa Harlowe" was published immediately after "Night
Thoughts," and the drawn-out death-bed agonies of Clarissa, her
coffin adorned with designs of broken lilies, may have been
inspired by the author of "Night Thoughts," the friend of
Richardson. In a few years followed the melancholy, elegant
perfection of Gray's Elegy and the wild gloom of Ossian; and the
vogue of brooding despair and dreary lamentations spread with
astonishing celerity on the Continent. Before glancing at this
foreign fashion of melancholy a brief survey may be taken of a poem
that had so wide and continuous an influence.</p>

<p>Young in "Night Thoughts" was the poetical disciple of Thompson,
who, through John Philips, had turned to the Miltonic iambics;
Thompson had referred to "virtuous Young," and they shared two
possible patrons, Lord Melcombe and Lord Wilmington. Our first
landscape poet had turned the attention of his contemporaries from
the heroic couplet of Dryden and Pope to the blank verse of Milton,
Dr. Young also refused "to dance in fetters," as Prior termed
writing in rhyme, and copied the manner of the author of "The
Seasons"; he could not copy his flowing polish, the delicacy of his
touch, the purity of his taste, which shows through all the
ponderous Latinisms of the day; he was incapable of such loveliness
as the delicious episodes of Musidora or Lavinia:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"The lovely young Lavinia once had friends,<br>
And fortune smiled, deceitful, on her birth,"</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
where the classic figures seem no more out of place in these
airy, golden landscapes than do the nymphs and shepherds in the
perspectives of Claude Gele or the Greek temples in a canvas by
Wilson:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Where scattered wild the Lily of the Vale<br>
Its balmy essence breathes, where cowslips hang<br>
Their dewy head, where purple violets lurk."</p>

<br>

<p>Young's metre is full of faults; he had studied Milton, but to
no great purpose; he could not escape the lure of the neat couplet,
the pause at the end of every line, the effective quotable sentence
and such ornaments as antithesis, alliteration and metaphor,
useless return of the verb, ornament carried to excess. He was
never so inspired as to rise above a certain gaudiness of
expression, or so disciplined as to be able to control a cascade of
images falling one on the other in glittering confusion. In the
whole of the "Nights" there is nothing so clear, so human, and so
happy as Pope's lines in the rival poem, beginning:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Lo! the poor Indian! Whose untutored mind<br>
Sees God in clouds, or hears Him in the wind,"</p>
<br>

<p class="first">and ending with the exquisite:</p>

<p class="verse">
"To be content's his natural desire,<br>
He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire,<br>
But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,<br>
His faithful dog shall bear him company."</p>

<br>

<p>It is often difficult to know what Young means to say, yet it is
not often that the ear fails to be pleased with the sonorous
grandeur with which he gilds his passionate incoherencies.</p>

<p>"Night Thoughts" is too well known for it to be needful here to
enter into a description of it or a consideration of who were
Lorenzo, Philander, or Narcissa&mdash;in all likelihood composite
portraits; the purpose of the poem is didactic (a contradiction in
terms), in reality one long exhortation to the thoughtless to
remember the brevity of life and to prepare for death as an
entrance into bliss. As usual in such moralising little is said of
this same bliss; it is a merc distant gleam, illusive as a marsh
fire, and all the emphasis of the poet is laid on the horrors of
this life, the glooms of death and the grave, the terrors of the
Judgment Day, and the swift punishments in store for those who fail
to realise that to enjoy oneself is a crime and to indulge in
worldy pursuits a stupidity. "Incredulity," the dying Diderot
exclaimed, "is the beginning of all philosophy." Young thought
credulity the beginning of all religion; one must believe blindly
in a future state where only the model Christian shall be
saved.</p>

<p>The good doctor, in brief, did not hold with the dictum of
Vauvenargues that "one has no right to render unhappy those one
cannot render good"&mdash;and dressing up a lay figure in the person of
Lorenzo, the man of the world and pleasure, he proceeds to preach
and scold at his gaudy puppet till the reader longs to hear Lorenzo
quote Sir Toby Belch: "Dost thou think because thou art virtuous
there shall be no more cakes and ale?"</p>

<p>But that appears to be exactly what Young, if he did not think,
hoped; he was, with Dryden:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Tired of waiting for the Chymic gold,<br>
Which fools us young and beggars us when old,"</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
and by no means disposed to view with indulgence a world that
had been so blind to his own merits. He also suffered from that odd
lack of sympathy with vice which is the most unpleasant trait of
some types of virtue, and that ancient delusion that the period in
which he lived&mdash;"the dregs of time"&mdash;was unsurpassed for
wickedness. Refusing Congreve's common sense:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"For virtue now is neither more nor less<br>
And vice is only varied in its dress"&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
he believed that the reign of the first two Georges was an epoch
of scandal, corruption, atheism, folly, disorder, and suicide never
paralleled before; to him:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"The flattered crimes of a licentious age<br>
Reproach our silence and demand our rage."</p>

<br>

<p>Subsequent historians also have taken this view, but save for
some change in manners it is difficult to credit that the
eighteenth century was different from any other century, and that
the crimes and follies lashed by Young are not the crimes and
follies of all time. In many directions the years when "Night
Thoughts" appeared are full of interest: Royalty had recently stood
to hear the Hallelujah Chorus in Handel's "Messiah" performed for
the first time; William Collins was writing those odes, unique in
our language, which lament those fallen in the long tedious war in
which a King of England for the last time led his troops in person;
the Stewart cause was gathering for its final overthrow at Culloden
Moor; William Hogarth was designing the pictures that were to found
the English school of painting; and the odd genius of Richardson
had just provoked Henry Fielding to write the first modern English
novel.</p>

<p>None of these things interested Edward Young; he merely saw
"stalled theology" too comfortable in high places, Court corruption
and the gambling, drinking, wantonness of the idle youth of the
nation; Lorenzo, the villain of "Night Thoughts," is the Tom
Rakewell of "The Rake's Progress," the Lord Squanderfield of
"Marriage  la Mode" soon to be designed, the Robert Lovelace of
"Clarissa" just published, the Lord Euston and Duke of Wharton of
real life; in short, Lorenzo is the personification of that
beautiful, proud, and careless youth, garlanded with earthly
pleasures, arrogant in strength of body and power of intellect, who
is so attractive that even the moralist who attacks him must dwell
on his splendours with secret admiration. Through "Night Thoughts,"
as through so many didactics on this theme, rims the note of
regret, of envy for what is so magnificent, so transitory, there
runs also the note of malice, the desire to destroy the likeness of
the pomps that have been missed, the lusts that have been outworn;
with relish does the old man consign the sparkling youth to:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"A state<br>
Not unambitious; in the ruffled shroud,<br>
Thy Parian tomb's triumphant arch beneath,"</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
and yet he must linger on the joy and pride and passion he
condemns, "the fopperies of fortune," all the adornments of "this
prisoner of earth, pent beneath the moon."</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Lorenzo, Fortune makes her court to thee,<br>
Thy fond heart dances, while the siren sings,"</p>

<br>

<p>and again:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"&mdash;well may Life<br>
Put on her plume and in her rainbow shine."</p>

<br>

<p>Young dwells on the "vast concerns of an eternal scene," and the
moment when "the sun is darkness and the stars are dust," but he
cannot resist the fascination of youth, pride, beauty whose</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"Glossy plumes<br>
Expanded shine with azure, green and gold."</p>

<br>

<p>Lorenzo might be:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Smothered with errors, and oppressed with
toys,"</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
but his sparkling earthly radiance outshines the fanciful
horrors of the moralist. The lamentations and reproaches addressed
to this unbelieving rake and the lost Narcissa are clothed in a
richness of imagery that probably went far to secure the success of
the poem; frequent dark landscapes are sketched that have no
relation to the scenes Young must have viewed round Welwyn, but
more resemble one of those black and sulphurous compositions by
Salvator Rosa. Here, as in his earlier verse, Young provides all
the stage properties inherited by the neo-Gothic School from
Walpole to Mrs. Radcliffe and Maturin; here are the rocks, grottos,
mossy ruins, owls, groves, charnel-houses, skulls, "the funereal
vale," "the sad cypress gloom" and howling winds, midnight hours,
"the ghastly ruins of the mouldering tomb" and "the poor worms"
soon to be so familiar in a section of our literature, and here,
too, are some terrific pictures of the Last Judgment, a favourite
subject with Young, which might have inspired the imposing
conceptions of Gustave Dore and John Martin; here, as in his plays,
Young employs the grandest images possible, sun, moon, stars
curdling into vapour or dissolving into dust, eternal trumpets
splitting the sky, legions of fiends and angels and the earth
reeling in chaos. This, if not sublime, as it is meant to be, is at
least impressive&mdash;like the decorations at Versailles, Young's
crowded lines may be stucco, but they are good stucco, heroically
moulded and adorned with a rich if gaudy ornament.</p>

<p>Sumptuously, for instance, does he describe the common
experience of day-dreaming in this couplet:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"How richly were my noontide trances hung<br>
With gorgeous tapestries of pictured joys!"</p>

<br>

<p>And how magnificent this description of night visions:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"What, tho' my Soul phantastic Measures trod,<br>
O'er Fairy Fields; or mourn'd along the gloom<br>
Of pathless Woods; or down the craggy Steep<br>
Hurl'd headlong, swam with pain the mantled Pool;<br>
Or scal'd the cliff; or danc'd on Hollow Winds,<br>
With antic Shapes, wild Natives of the Brain?"</p>

<br>

<p>The single lines are very well known&mdash;best of all perhaps the
opening line of the First Night:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Tir'd Nature's sweet restorer, Balmy Sleep."</p>

<br>

<p>Then others&mdash;forcible and just:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Strong Reason's shudder at the Dark Unknown."<br>
"Love of fame is Avarice of Air."<br>
"Who cheapens Life abates the fear of Death."<br>
"Virtue alone outlasts the Pyramids."<br>
"'Tis vain to seek in man for more than man"&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
and many other similar lines, which have passed into the
language, though it is sometimes not remembered that Young wrote
them.</p>

<p>The following lines give a fair idea of Young's power of
creating a grand image, and are not marred by many of his usual
faults:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"The Nameless He, whose nod is Nature's birth;<br>
And Nature's shield, the shadow of His hand;<br>
Her dissolution, his suspended smile;<br>
The great first last! Pavilioned high he sits<br>
In Darkness, from excessive splendour torn,<br>
By Gods, unseen unless, through lustre lost.<br>
His glory, to created glory lights,<br>
As that, to central horrors; He looks down<br>
On all that soars; and spans Immensity."</p>

<br>
<hr>

<p>Despite the extreme gloom of the poem (Pope suggested "Go hang
thyself" as a motto for it) it became popular immediately, and the
influence of "Night Thoughts" spread in Young's own country down
from Goldsmith to Cowper and to the sombre misery of Kirke White,
with his extremely melancholy "Dance of Consumptives among the
Graves," "where troops of squalid spectres play," and where
references to "eves of Death," "chilling damps," "vain illusions of
deceitful life," "mid-night ghosts" evoke the very air of "Night
Thoughts," while the fragment, "Written in Prospect of Death,"
might almost be from the hand of Young. There was, however, a
pathetic difference in the writers&mdash;Henry Kirke White was a young
and dying man when he woke "to watch the sickly taper that lights
me to my tomb," while Young was old and healthy when he darkened
life by fears of death. The early work of Lord Byron, who refers to
Young and had evidently studied "Night Thoughts," was not
unaffected by the glooms of the rector of Welwyn, whose poem,
illustrated twice, by the wild uncouth pencil of William Blake and
the insipid prettiness of Thomas Stothard's graver, was still in
active circulation in the early years of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>Several English poems were indebted to the "Night Thoughts" not
only for their mood and colouring, but even for actual lines, such
as Goldsmith's "Edwin and Angelina"</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Man wants but little here below<br>
Nor wants that little long,"</p>

<br>

<p class="first">which is Young's</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Man wants but little, nor that little long."</p>

<br>

<p>"The Task" is obliged, in a like manner, to "Night Thoughts,"
and there is another quotation in "The Parish Register."</p>

<p>Gray's famous line:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"And waste its sweetness on the desert air,"</p>

<br>

<p class="first">seems an echo of one of Young's satires:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"And waste their music on the savage race."</p>

<br>

<p>An article in the <i>Literary Gazette</i>, 1821, pointed out
many lines in "The Corsair" and "Manfred" that almost repeat the
actual words of Young, as "Sorrow is knowledge," Byron's form of
"Knowing is suffering," and "That hideous sight, a naked human
heart," which in Byron becomes "That open sepulchre, the naked
heart." Even "In Memoriam" contains similar echoes, as "In thy
wisdom make me wise," which is near to "And teach your wisdom to be
wise." A most erudite critic of Edward Young, Dr. Thomas, has even
seen in Lady Clara Vere de Vere's:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Oh teach the orphan boy to read!<br>
Or teach the orphan girl to sew,"&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="first">an echo of Young's:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Do some generous good,<br>
Teach Ignorance to see or grief to smile."</p>

<br>

<p>Certainly John Keble's famous first line:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Sun of my Soul, Thou Saviour dear"&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="first">is very similar to Young's:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Sun of the soul, her never setting sun."</p>

<br>

<p>In France the influence of Young was even more remarkable; it
appears to echo in the "A quoi bon?" of Julie de Lespinasse, the
muse of the encyclopaedists themselves, who probably liked Young as
well as the admired "Clarissa," and by 1770 Letourneur's
translation was so successful that "Youngisme" became a phrase, and
a contemporary verse declared:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse"><br>
"Les crpes de Young se mlent<br>
Parmi les pompons de toilette."</p>

<br>

<p>Camille Desmoulins read Young and Harvey (their works were
published in one volume) the night before his execution, and
another victim of the Revolution of 1789, Andre Chnier, was moved
to protest against the immense influence "of the frenzied English
despair." The popularity of the book continued, however, into the
nineteenth century, and translation followed translation, and
imitation imitation. The vogue was at last checked by the
condemnations of Chateaubriand and Madame de Stael, though
Chateaubriand himself had once felt the influence of Young. The
shadow of "Night Thoughts" falls on Lamartine, the poem was read
by, if it did not affect, De Vigny, Balzac, and De Musset.</p>

<p>In Italy the success and effect of "Night Thoughts" were no less
notable; the edition of 1771 was honoured with a preface by that
supremely gracious imperial poet, the Abb Pietro Metastasio, and,
apart from the many minor versifiers powerfully affected by the
black gorgeous gloom of the Englishman, may be cited Ippolito
Pindemonte's "Dei Sepolcri," with greater names, those of Ugo
Foscolo and Giacomo Leopardi, whose melancholy muses appear to have
been directly inspired by Young's funereal meditations; one of
Leopardi's poems also is entitled "Night Thoughts."</p>

<p>Ugo Foscolo, that most noble and unfortunate of patriots and
poets, also was in his earlier work, notably in his "Sepolcri,"
dedicated to the memory of Parini, and in "Jacopo Ortis" distinctly
inspired by the pessimism of Young.</p>

<p>"Night Thoughts" was translated also into Portuguese, Castilian
and Russian; in Russia the poem appeared in ten different editions
and is supposed to have encouraged the gloom of Pushkin; a Dutch
edition inspired William Bellamy and Van Haren, and the
Scandinavian languages also gave their three different versions of
the sombre compositions of the rector of Welwyn, which were
published also in Icelandic, Polish, and Hungarian.</p>

<p>In Germany the effect of these lugubrious poems was tremendous:
they were warmly welcomed by Klopstock, whose "Messiah" began to
appear in 1748. Meta, Klopstock's beloved wife, passionately
revered Young and thought he deserved the Archbishopric of
Canterbury. Johann Evald, the lofty, exquisite and unhappy Danish
poet, died with a copy of the "Messiah" under his pillow, and was,
through Klopstock, influenced by Young. Published in a German
translation in 1751, "Night Thoughts" was immediately a fashion;
Teutonic imitations of Young sprang up thick and fast, like fungi
on the damp graves of Welwyn, and the gloom of Young tinged the
work of Jean Paul Richter, Herder, Lessing, inspired Friedrich von
Hardenberg, known as "Novalis," to write "Hymns to Night,"
influenced Hoffmann and Goethe, and helped the Rousseauan "return
to Nature movement." The "Sorrows of Werther" are, in a sense, the
sorrows of Edward Young; Ossian, whose vogue at first ran side by
side with that of "Night Thoughts," at last eclipsed the earlier
poem in Germany, but not before this atmosphere of pessimism and
regret had permeated the whole of German literature, one might
indeed add, the whole of European literature, for it is hardly
fantastic to trace in the disenchanted romanticism, the sombre
fancies, the wailing laments, the dreary disgust for earthly
pleasures so notable in the work of writers of the late eighteenth
and early nineteenth century, the attitude of "loathing life, and
black with more than melancholy views" of Edward Young, though he
had long since, in his own words, had to "toss fortune back her
tinsel and her plume," and admit:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"My world is dead;<br>
A new world rises and new manners come,<br>
Foreign Comedians, a spruce band, arrive,<br>
To push me from the scene, or hiss me there."</p>

<p class="caption">Mary Stewart (1542-1587)<br>
(Portait by Franois Clouet, 1560)</p>
</div>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">
MARY STEWART was not in herself a very remarkable woman, but her
circumstances made her appear so. There is no indication in her
character that she would have become notable by reason of her own
personal qualities. Fair, high-spirited, indiscreet, and ardent
women were common enough in the aristocracy of the Renaissance,
have been common enough in any sheltered, idle, luxurious class. Of
political acumen, of elevated patriotism, of selfless, far-seeing
devotion to a cause or to an ideal, Mary Stewart showed no trace.
Her little accomplishments of verse-making, lute-playing, dancing,
fine needlework, have largely to be taken on trust and, at best,
could have been matched by any well-bred lady of her time. Her
seductive charm has become largely fabulous; the authority for it
rests in great part on the studied eulogies of courtiers, or the
tributes of men like Brantme, writing in their old age of youthful
memories. Her few authentic portraits give us no more than that
"pleasing face of a gentlewoman," which was John Knox's description
of his sovereign's countenance.</p>

<p>But because she was placed in such an extraordinary situation,
because her story contains the crude elements of apparent romance,
love episodes, murders, imprisonments, escapes, plots, a violent
death, legends have clustered thickly round her personality; she
has been dramatised and sentimentalised until it is extremely
difficult to see her even with that small degree of truth which is
the most we can hope for when looking back at the great figures of
history.</p>

<p>The most important parts of her story are obscure, and will
always be matter for controversy among the many, and for fanatic
bitterness and acrid partisanship among the few.</p>

<p>Mary Stewart was of importance politically because of her
position, and not because of her character or attainments. As Queen
of one country and heiress to another she was, all her life, of
great interest to European statesmen, and during the last years of
her imprisonment she became a very powerful factor in the Roman
Catholic effort to effect a counterreformation in England; it has
been said, probably without exaggeration, that the whole of
Elizabeth Tudor's policy revolved round Mary of Scotland. It has
also been said, with equal truth, that Mary's failures&mdash;her almost
incredible misfortunes&mdash;resided within herself; she had not the
qualities necessary for success in a position of bewildering and
intricate difficulty. We may admit as much, but we should also
concede that very few women indeed would have been able to succeed
where Mary failed. It is doubtful if any Roman Catholic girl of
nineteen, foreign-bred, without disinterested advisers, could have
achieved the task of ruling well and wisely the Protestant Scotland
that Mary found when she landed at Leith in 1561. It is perhaps not
likely that many women in Mary's position would have made the
terrible mistake of marrying a man implicated in the murder of a
husband, but, on the other hand, it is extremely unlikely that any
woman, trying to queen it in Holyrood, would have escaped some
amorous entanglement, some snare of bloody violence that would have
brought her to ruin as swiftly as the Rizzio, Darnley, Bothwell
imbroglio brought Mary to disaster. If her imprudence seems
startling, it is probably because we do not sufficiently realise
her background or the atmosphere in which she moved. This typical
woman of the late Renaissance is too often viewed either in the
fairy-tale light of legend, or through the sentimental pages of
nineteenth-century refinement.</p>

<p>The first step towards understanding Mary is to understand her
period; she was neither the heroine of a ballad, nor a Victorian
lady in distressing circumstances. Nor was she that poetic
conception, an ethereal creature seeking an ideal lover and
continually betrayed by love. Her choice of husbands seems stupid
beyond belief, until we consider the men who surrounded her, the
men who were offered to her as possible lovers or consorts. Her
actions were those of a woman always tormented, often desperate,
driven by circumstances and her own temperament into horrible
difficulties, and extricating herself by the wit, courage, and
falsehood, born of necessity. Stripped of the trappings given it by
fiction-writers and poets, her story is neither noble nor
beautiful, nor, in the true sense of the word, romantic. The
motives of all concerned in her downfall, and as far as we know
them, her own, were too brutal and sordid for her tragedy to have
real dignity or pathos. Even if she were as brilliantly innocent as
her most fanatic admirers would have us believe she was, her
conduct during the crisis of her fortunes was too wilful, foolish,
and opportunist to be really admirable or moving. Her royal
position demanded an impossible virtue, a self-respect, a
self-control, a fortitude, and a dignity that no young woman could
have been expected to possess, but Mary's behaviour fell
disastrously below even a moderate standard of queenly decorum. It
was the old story of Caesar's wife; what did it matter if she was
really spotless?&mdash;she gave <i>cause</i> for a blaze of scandal in
Europe and was cast out of her own country, despoiled of
everything, to the last shred of reputation. Nor was she wholly the
victim of the lies of her rivals and enemies; even the impartial
observer, the friendly well-wisher might, in all honesty, have
thought that it was a murderess, an adulteress, a treacherous liar,
that fled across the Solway after the Langside defeat in 1568. Du
Croc, the French ambassador, who was desirous, from every point of
view, of championing Mary, observed that her personal appeal to the
King of France would be of little avail&mdash;"since the unhappy facts
are too well known." Those, then, who had cause to dislike or to
fear the Queen of Scots had plenty of excuse for violently decrying
her, and the plain man and woman every reason for regarding the
discrowned ruler with doubt and suspicion.</p>

<p>Imprisonment and death were, in this age, the consequences of
political failure&mdash;they were also the punishments for domestic
crime. Mary had not succeeded in ruling Scotland, and she could
hardly have hoped to escape the penalty her ancestors had paid for
failure in the same task. As a woman she had recklessly misjudged
and mishandled her affairs, and as a private person, could not have
expected to escape censure and punishment. Her only chance of
escape from being damaged by embarrassing charges would have lain
in her strength as a ruler; a Sophie of Anhalt, with a Potemkin by
her side, might have lived down or glossed over a scandal like Kirk
o' Field. But Mary was a weak, a dethroned sovereign, and therefore
could not afford to disregard conventional standards of morality.
What protection, what measure of safety she had, she owed to her
sole possession&mdash;the name of Queen. If, like Alice Arden, she had
been arraigned with her lover for murder of her husband before an
English jury, her fate would surely have been the same as that of
the murderous wife of Faversham. She was fortunate that, as a Queen
who had made a headlong failure of politics, she escaped by flight
the instant vengeance of her enemies, and fortunate that, as a
woman, she was never put on trial for her supposed crimes, but
allowed to die when these were almost forgotten, and changed
circumstances had given her the dignity of a martyr.</p>

<p>So much warm sympathy and tender sentiment have been expended
over Mary Stewart, the facts of her long imprisonment and violent
death seem in themselves so atrocious, there is something so
touching in the slow wearing away of her youth and beauty in
hopeless pining, that to consider her case logically is to be
adjudged hard, or prejudiced in favour of Protestantism and Queen
Elizabeth. If, however, any attempt is to be made to present an
even partially true portrait (the whole truth will surely be for
ever concealed) of this much-discussed character, the pity allowed
to the poet, the championship permitted to the novelist, must be
discarded. Mary's appeal, of femininity, of beauty, of misfortune,
is wholly to the heart, and the heart is a bad guide for the
historian.</p>

<p>Mary's life was, from first to last, dramatic and unfortunate;
she was born in 1542 a week before her father, James V, died at the
age of thirty in Falkland Castle, overwhelmed by the disastrous
relationship with England that had culminated in the defeat of the
Scots at Solway Moss, November, 1542. James V was directly
descended from Robert the Steward (reigned 1371-90); the Kings of
this House had all been able men, quite the equals of contemporary
sovereigns; their misfortunes, the violent deaths of many of them,
might be ascribed to long minorities, the power of the Barons, the
fiery independent spirit of the Scots and the rudeness of the
times, rather than to any marked incapacity of their own. James IV
(reigned 14881513) was a notable Prince, under whose rule Scotland
flourished in what was afterwards regarded as a Golden Age; he was
a great builder, a founder of three Universities, a patron of
literature, an ambitious ruler. He married Margaret, daughter of
Henry VII (1503), and was slain fighting against the forces of his
brother-in-law at Flodden (1513). This King was Mary Stewart's
grandfather; from his wife, Margaret Tudor, Mary derived the
dangerous claim to the English throne, which was the root of most
of her grandeur and most of her troubles. During the minority of
James V (1513-1542) this Queen-Mother Margaret complicated the
claims to the Scottish succession by marrying and then divorcing
the turbulent Earl of Angus, to whom she bore a daughter, Margaret,
afterwards married to Mathew Stewart, Earl of Lennox.</p>

<p>James V married in succession two French princesses; the "auld
alliance" with France was a strong element in Scottish policy, and
the menacing attitude of Henry VIII did much to strengthen this
ancient connection. Mary Stewart was the only child to survive
infancy of the second marriage, that of James V with Mary of Guise,
daughter of the great House of Lorraine and widow of the Duc de
Longueville.</p>

<p>The dispute that had led to Solway Moss was caused by an attempt
on the part of Henry VIII to force his nephew to set up the tenets
of the Reformation in Scotland, to defy the Pope and despoil the
monasteries, which had absorbed an enormous share of the country's
wealth. James V, however, was a sincere Roman Catholic, and his
principal adviser was David Beaton, the Cardinal Archbishop of St.
Andrews. This strong and able prelate was the principal adviser to
the widowed Mary of Guise, and crowned the infant Queen a year
after her father's death. The Regent was the heir-presumptive to
the throne, the head of the Hamiltons, the Earl of Arran. This
nobleman was inclined to Protestantism and the English alliance,
and Mary, despite her mother's opposition, would have been
betrothed to Prince Edward (Edward VI), had not King Henry's terms
been couched in a manner completely insulting to the proud Scots.
Upon the breaking off of the marriage treaty (1543) Henry VIII
invaded and devastated Scotland; for six years (1544-1550) the war
(continued after Henry's death, 1547, by the Protector Somerset)
harried the Scots with every horror of fire and sword. The little
Queen, in the safe retreats of Inchmahome and Dumbarton, lived
peacefully in the midst of these turmoils; her mother and Beaton
leaned naturally to the French alliance, and in 1548 Mary, with an
elegant retinue and the little playmates who bore her name, was
sent to France to be educated by her maternal grandmother, the
austere and virtuous Antoinette de Bourbon, and her celebrated
uncles, the soldier Prince and the Cardinal Prince of the powerful
and ambitious House of Guise.</p>

<p>Mary was warmly received by the King of France, Henri II, and
from what we know of the childhood that she spent mostly on the
fine estates of Joinville, it was happy, uneventful, and full of
promise. The child who was in such an exalted and strange position
was praised by all as lovely, charming, docile, and accomplished.
Two lessons, at least, her Guise relations taught her&mdash;a firm
adherence to her hereditary faith and an intense pride of
birth.</p>

<p>While the young Queen was growing up under the influence of the
haughty members of the House of Lorraine, her mother was
endeavouring to stem the rising forces of Protestantism in
Scotland. Lutheranism had for some years begun to attract the
sturdy spirit of the Scottish commoner, and the nobles looked with
greedy eyes on the swollen possessions of the Church. The
Government was weak, and outbursts of fanaticism roused and focused
popular discontents. Cardinal Beaton had been murdered (in revenge
for the death of the Protestant, George Wishart), in his own castle
two years before Mary went to France; John Knox was with his
murderers, who were sent to the galleys in 1548; after nineteen
months of this slavery he was released by English intercession,
resided for a while at the court of Edward VI, then retired to
Geneva and the counsels of Jean Calvin. By 1555 Knox, a furious
firebrand of a man, was back in Scotland rejoicing over the rapidly
increasing power of Protestantism. To counteract this English
Protestant tendency, Henri II induced Arran to accept a French
dukedom (Chteauhrault), and to resign the Regency to the loyal,
brave, and single-minded Mary of Guise. In 1558 Mary Stewart
married Franois, the Dauphin, amid great pomp in the Cathedral of
Notre Dame, Paris. The bride was admired for her beauty, sweetness,
and amiable grace; the bridegroom, a swart lad of nineteen, bore
pitiful marks of degeneracy&mdash;stammering, frail, in constant pain,
he was already a victim to the tuberculosis that was in a short
time to kill him. Mary seems to have been fond of her unhappy
husband; she was kind and affectionate with him, and nursed
devotedly his increasing illness.</p>

<p>On this occasion of her marriage she entered politics with an
act of treachery that showed either the foolishness of a girl or
the double-dealing of a false nature. She signed Scotland away, by
a secret document, to her father-in-law, while the Scottish
Commissioners, who had come to France to protect their country,
were fobbed off with a sham undertaking, which Mary privately
promised not to honour. Doubtless the young bride acted under the
influence of her relations; but in thus endeavouring to reduce her
kingdom to an appanage of France, like Brittany, in thus, as the
first act of her reign, deliberately tricking her subjects, she
gave no indication of either the brilliant intellect or the
generous heart she was supposed to possess. In 1559, Henri II was
killed in an accident, and Mary and Franois became joint
sovereigns of Scotland and France. Her father-in-law had done her
one disservice in advising her to adopt the style, arms, and
liveries of Queen of England on the death of Mary Tudor in 1558.
Elizabeth was, in the opinion of all Roman Catholics, illegitimate,
and Mary Stewart the rightful sovereign of England; but to assert
these claims was a meaningless flourish on the part of Henri II,
and roused a bitter resentment and a deep suspicion in Elizabeth
Tudor, which she never overcame.</p>

<p>The return of Knox to Scotland in 1559 was the signal for a
Protestant rebellion that Mary of Guise was powerless to repress;
when she died in 1560 (a great personal grief to her daughter), the
triumphant Protestants established the Reformed Church, and "the
Lords of the Congregation" assumed the government of the country,
with only a technical acknowledgment of the sovereignty of Mary and
her husband. This was the end of the Roman Church and the French
alliance in Scotland; the Lords, chief among whom was James
Stewart, Mary's half-brother, gorged themselves with Church lands,
and looked to Elizabeth for support, money, and counsel.</p>

<p>The death from tuberculosis of the young Francois II in 1560
left Mary in a desolate position; the new King, Charles IX, was a
child, the power of the House of Guise was in eclipse, and
Catherine de Medicis, the Queen-Mother, disliked her
daughter-in-law. The Queen of Scots, who had won golden opinions by
her beauty, meekness, discretion, and dignity, refused to ratify
the treaty of Edinburgh, made between England and the rebel Lords,
thereby incurring the increased enmity of Elizabeth, and returned
to Scotland, August, 1561. She had refused an invitation from the
Earl of Huntly, Cock o' the North, brought by Leslie, Bishop of
Ross, to attempt to restore her faith by force, but acquiesced,
probably on the advice of her Guise kinsmen, in the Protestant
establishment; she made the able and avaricious Lord James, her
half-brother, her principal adviser, and submitted to a state of
affairs that punished with death a second attendance at Mass. She
could barely obtain a reluctant consent for the private exercise of
her own worship in Holyrood, and signed decrees banishing monks and
nuns under severe penalties.</p>

<p>Her figure is here shadowy; she seems to have been passive in
the hands of the Lord James and his party, very willing to please
her Protestant subjects, eager to court Elizabeth, full of high
spirits and pretty ways. She had brought a French retinue with her,
and their luxurious elegance and her own frivolous amusements
proved ample material for the eloquence of John Knox to embellish
into a picture of "Venus and all her crew." The fiery reformer was
probably half-insane, and there is no evidence whatever that Mary
had learnt any vices in France or that her diversions in Holyrood
were not wholly innocent. So far did she go in complaisance to her
half-brother and the Lords, that she herself rode against her
rebellious subject and co-religionist, the Earl of Huntly, and
appeared to rejoice at the ruin of the Gordons and the Roman
Catholic North. She gave the Lord James the title of Earl of Moray
(Murray) and endured patiently perpetual schemes and
counter-schemes for her second marriage. Her nerves were galled raw
by the intricate disputes over her future husband; the same
question was also exasperating Elizabeth almost beyond endurance.
To these speculations was joined that of the successions to the two
Kingdoms; would Elizabeth die unwed or childless, and Mary and
Catholicism inherit England, or would Elizabeth and Protestantism
swallow up, one way or another, Scotland? Moray, and even more
definitely Sir William Maitland, most brilliant of Scottish
politicians, were working towards England and the tenets of the
Reformation; Mary, passive though she seemed, was in everything
vowed to France and the Pope, who had sent her the Golden Rose,
sadly naming her&mdash;"Rose among Thorns."</p>

<p>It is not known how many Roman Catholics remained in Scotland,
nor how far the desolation of the country, the ruin of abbeys,
convents, churches, and church property was due to the zeal of the
Reformers, and how much to the brutality of Somerset's armies, but
it cannot be disputed that Mary found her faith cast out and
insulted, her way of life reviled, and her conduct exposed to the
fanatic insolence of John Knox and his followers. She kept her
temper admirably, but she suffered in spirit, and her health
failed; she was subject to frequent fainting fits and bouts of
melancholy. Among the turbulent, lawless, greedy, and often
dishonest nobles who surrounded the lonely girl, there was not one
on whom she could rely in any way. Even Moray, well as he served
her, was Elizabeth's pensioner, and no one could be sure of
Maitland.</p>

<p>Mary showed some interest in a brilliant French border
chieftain, James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, her mother's loyal
servant, but he had to flee the country for misconduct and Mary
appears at this period not to have had any favourite, man or
woman.</p>

<p>It is impossible, here, to hint even at the complexity of
European politics that formed Mary's background; her own one
political idea was to be recognised as heiress to the English crown
and, ultimately, to bring back the two Kingdoms under Roman,
Catholicism. She was even prepared to consider Elizabeth's own
favourite, the Earl of Leicester, as a possible husband, if that
Queen would promise her the English succession; but Elizabeth's and
Burleigh's intricate schemes were developed in an endless
procrastination. Mary's conduct, never yet blamed for more than
feminine frivolity or youthful lightness, was the subject of gossip
during the Chastelard affair, when a young Frenchman was beheaded
(1562) for the audacity of twice concealing himself in her bedroom;
the Queen passed the first years of her reign without provoking any
censure more serious than the unseemly diatribes of the fanatic
Puritans. Her elegance and beauty, her taste and sweet manners,
were much extolled; she was affable to all, and seemed to have
triumphed in a difficult position when she made the marriage that
was, literally, fatal to all her fortunes.</p>

<p>Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, came to Scotland in 1565; he was
the elder son of Mathew Stewart, Earl of Lennox, who had taken
service with the English and Margaret, daughter of Margaret Tudor
and the Earl of Lennox; he was, after Mary, the heir to the English
throne. On his father's side he could claim royal blood, for Lennox
was descended from James II through his daughter Mary. Darnley had
been educated as an Englishman, trained and pampered by an
ambitious mother, and came to Scotland an arrogant, wilful,
passionate boy of nineteen. He was instantly disliked by the
Scottish nobles and instantly infatuated Mary. All the accounts
that we have of him are so unfavourable that it is difficult to
understand how a brilliant, witty, ardent woman could have become
so enamoured of him. It is to be supposed that he possessed
exceptional good-looks; Randolph, the dry English ambassador,
thought that no woman could resist "that fair face."</p>

<p>Mary's sudden passion was headlong; despite the Tudor claim,
Darnley was not&mdash;especially by Moray and his party&mdash;thought to be a
worthy match, but Mary married him secretly in March and publicly
in July of 1565.</p>

<p>The Queen's behaviour during the next few years of her life has
been the subject of such acrid dispute, and is in itself so
obscure, that only the mere outline of her story can be described
in a limited space, and this with the greatest reserve.</p>

<p>The marriage gave the Queen a sudden spirit of independence&mdash;she
cast herself into the Romish party, neglected Elizabeth and Moray,
showed energy, restless self-assertion, and a disposition for
foreign intrigue. She raised to authority and admitted to her
intimacy one David Rizzio, a confidant of her husband, and made him
her foreign secretary, an honour that the Italian bore with
insolence and that outraged both nobles and the King. Moray was
stung into rebellion and rose in arms at Ayr; Mary, gathering five
thousand men, chased him from pillar to post, and finally out of
the kingdom. Meanwhile, her marriage had fallen to pieces; Darnley,
weak, bewildered, young, and undisciplined, clamoured for the crown
matrimonial, and spent his time in field sports, and invectives
against all who opposed him.</p>

<p>Mary's passion for the fair youth soon flared out, and such was
her indiscretion that, when her pregnancy was first known, the
English envoy expressed his conviction that the child had been
fathered by Rizzio. Darnley also took the extreme step of
jeopardising the succession of the child by asserting that the
Italian was his wife's lover, while the nobles took advantage of
Darnley's fury to plan the murder of Rizzio. This scheme was known
at the English Court, but Mary seems to have been in utter
ignorance of the storm that her folly had provoked, until it broke
in her presence, March, 1566. By Darnley's express wish Rizzio was
dragged from Mary's supper-table in Holyrood and murdered in her
ante-chamber. The Queen was made a prisoner, but had, under these
fearful circumstances, the address to detach her husband from his
fellow conspirators, and to induce him to escape with her from
Holyrood. Moray returned to Scotland, and though Mary probably knew
of his share in the Rizzio outrage, she received him in friendly
fashion. Moreover, until the birth of her son (June, 1566), she
affected good terms with Darnley, who had publicly repudiated any
share in the murder of the Italian.</p>

<p>But Mary had received from the other conspirators proof of his
complicity. Soon after the birth of her son (Darnley tacitly
accepted the paternity) Mary made the Earl of Bothwell conspicuous
by her favours, and did not disguise her frantic desire to be rid
of her wretched husband. Darnley had been doomed from the moment he
had so foolishly betrayed his fellow murderers, and the Lords (the
guiding spirits being probably Moray and Maitland) decided to use
Bothwell as a cat's-paw in removing him, as they had used Darnley
as a cat's-paw in removing Rizzio. Bothwell was "a lewd man,
blinded by ambition," violent, brave, and vicious; he had earned
Mary's gratitude by helping in her escape from Holyrood and, used
to success with women, was confident of winning her, and through
her, the crown. The Lords seem to have promised him Mary as a bribe
for murdering (or organising the murder of) Darnley; but this is
all matter for endless controversy. Certain it is that Mary and
Darnley quarrelled bitterly, that he threatened to leave the
kingdom, that she showed open favour to Bothwell, newly married to
Jane Gordon, sister of the Earl of Huntly. It was believed by many
that Bothwell was her lover soon after the birth of the child, as
they believed that Rizzio had been her lover soon after her
love-match with Darnley. It is certain that she knew of a deep
conspiracy against her husband when she went to fetch him, a sick
man, from Glasgow, where he was safe with his father, to Kirk o'
Field, a lonely house outside Edinburgh. This was blown up, and
Darnley's dead body found in a nearby field, February, 1567.</p>

<p>Seldom has a crime caused greater scandal. The explosion in Kirk
o' Field echoed throughout Europe, and the death of this young man,
despised and hated, important only by the accident of birth, was a
political rallying cry and an excuse for political and personal
revenge for years. It is not known how many people, instigators or
hired bravoes, were implicated in this clumsy murder, but most, if
not all, of those known to be concerned in it perished by murder or
on the scaffold. Mary was at once suspected and had her defence
ready&mdash;the plot had been intended to destroy her also and she had
escaped by accident. This was not tenable, and was held to be as
futile as Bothwell's explanation "that thunder <i>[sic]</i> from
heaven had consumed the King's dwelling."</p>

<p>No one seemed to doubt that Bothwell was the leading spirit in
the taking off of Henry Darnley, and Mary was warned by friends and
foes (notably by Elizabeth) that she could save her reputation only
by bringing the murderers to justice. It is doubtful if she could
have done this, as there were probably few among the Lords who had
not had some hand in the crime. But she made no show of wanting to;
Bothwell, under pressure from England and Lennox, was brought to a
farcical trial, where some of his fellow-murderers were among the
judges, and acquitted. Mary, disregarding all warnings and threats,
continued to show him open favour. On her return from a visit to
her son in Stirling Castle, April, 1567 (this was the last time she
saw him), she was abducted by Bothwell at a bridge over the Almond
and taken to Dunbar Castle. It was at once believed by many that
this outrage was committed with her connivance. Bothwell, with
scandalous haste, hurried a divorce from his innocent wife through
the courts, and brought the Queen to Edinburgh on May 3rd, the day
that the decree of divorce was pronounced. Mary made no protest,
offered no explanation, and made no effort to escape. Bothwell
forced the fiery and reluctant John Craig, Knox's deputy, to
announce his approaching marriage to the Queen, which the minister
did on May 9th in St. Giles's Church, calling "Heaven and earth to
witness that the proposed union was odious and scandalous to the
world." On May 12th Mary went to the Chief Court of Justice and
declared that she acted of her own free will and bore no offence
against Bothwell; the same day she created him Duke of Orkney, and
on May 15th she married him, in accordance with the rites of the
Reformed Church, in Holyrood Palace.</p>

<p>Reasons for this ruinous marriage have been variously given;
some argue that she had a romantic infatuation for Bothwell and did
not believe he was concerned in the Darnley murder, and so acted
with all the good faith a woman in love is capable of; others
suppose that she had been the Earl's mistress for some time, and
had urged on the murder and the divorce and arranged the abduction
to save her honour; and a third opinion is that she was a wholly
innocent woman, overpowered by Bothwell, and forced to marry him
after he had violently outraged her in Dunbar Castle. The common
feeling at the time, and apparently shared by Elizabeth, the
French, and English ambassadors, was that the wretched marriage was
owing to Mary's desperate attempt to save her reputation. It should
be noted that a woman of Mary's wit, spirit, and courage was hardly
likely to be tricked by a ruffian without some attempt to save
herself or some appeal for help. On the other hand, she had long
been in miserable health, was tormented by pain, fainting fits, and
hysterical attacks, while her appearance and manner showed the
utmost anguish of mind. Bothwell was detestable to all, a personal
enemy of England, of bad reputation, offensive to Mary's French
relations as a Protestant and a commoner, hopelessly compromised in
the murder of a man whose widow he had married three months after
the crime. Mary lost the good opinion of all; the Pope, Spain, and
France tacitly repudiated her, her subjects were shocked and angry;
the Lords&mdash;who had edged Bothwell on to destroy Darnley&mdash;now had a
good excuse for raising their standard against a murderess and a
murderer.</p>

<p>The Queen and Bothwell gathered what army they could together,
and met the Lords at Carberry Hill, seven miles from Edinburgh,
June, 1567. A day's wearisome negotiation, when Du Croc tried to
act as mediator, ended in failure; the Queen's men straggled over
to the Lords, Bothwell fled from the field, and Mary was brought
back a prisoner to Edinburgh, where the people greeted her with
cries of "murderess!" She was ignobly treated and lodged roughly in
the Provost's house, where she might be seen at the window in a
state of violent emotion, dishevelled and half-naked, shrieking for
help. Mary feared the death of an adulteress and murderess at the
stake, and with reason. The Blue Blanket, the famous banner of the
Trades Guild, had to be brought out to protect her from the mob
when the Lords moved her to Lochleven, the island home of Moray's
mother, Margaret Douglas. Moray's return to Scotland and the
skilful intervention of Elizabeth's envoy, Throgmorton, saved
Mary's life or shelved her trial for murder, but she was forced to
abdicate in favour of her son, who was crowned James VI.</p>

<p>The following year she contrived to escape from Lochleven and to
raise a force against her half-brother, Moray, then Regent for the
little King. At Langside her rabble of supporters was defeated, and
Mary fled for her life as fast as a horse could carry her, to
England, crossing the Solway with a few followers in May, 1568. She
has been blamed for this flight into England as for a great
blunder, but it is difficult to see what else she could have done.
She certainly hoped that Elizabeth was her friend, because that
Queen had helped her against the rebel Lords, and even hoped she
might find an English army to lead against Moray, but even though
she was in this grievously deceived, she had no reasonable
alternative to a flight into England. Elizabeth played her usual
game of shuttlecock; she detained Mary in honourable captivity, set
up a Commission to enquire into her position and guilt, and
meanwhile refused to see her or to allow her to come to London or
to plead her cause in person. Moray, to justify his rebellion, put
in the famous "casket" letters, which he declared had been found
under Bothwell's bed. These were love letters supposedly written by
Mary to Bothwell before their marriage, and one, the Glasgow
letter, afforded damning proof of her active agency in Darnley's
death. Mary declared the letters to be forgeries and Elizabeth
dissolved the Commission with a verdict of "not proven," but
continued to support Moray and to keep Mary in prison.</p>

<p>The question of the "casket" letters is one of the mysteries of
history; if they were forged (and this was an age of forgery, and
the Lords were completely unscrupulous), some very cunning hand
must have done the work, so exactly do they fit into Mary's story.
Mary, fretting desperately against a captivity that she regarded as
an act of base treachery and injustice, intrigued with the Roman
Catholics for her release (1569), agitated for her divorce from
Bothwell who had fled to Denmark, where he was a prisoner, and
schemed to marry the Protestant Duke of Norfolk. The rebellion was
promptly crushed by Elizabeth, and Norfolk finally put his head on
that "wooden pillow" against which the English Queen had warned
him. A small party in Scotland&mdash;"Queen's men"&mdash;struggled for Mary,
but with their ultimate defeat her last hopes of returning to her
throne vanished.</p>

<p>The rest of Mary's life is a dismal and monotonous chronicle of
the rapidly ageing, restless, ambitious, and sick woman's attempt
to regain freedom and power. It is easy to understand both her
attitude and that of Elizabeth. It was quite natural for Mary to
use every weapon of intrigue, deceit, and guile in order not only
to escape from an English prison, but to gain her lifelong
ambition, the English throne, and it was quite natural for
Elizabeth to watch and thwart these schemes and to regard Mary as a
source of grave potential danger, not only to herself, but to her
faith and the liberty of her people. The English Protestants
profoundly mistrusted and feared Mary, and Elizabeth was
continually urged by Parliament and people to do what her instinct
forbade her to do, get rid of a fellow-man and a
fellow-sovereign.</p>

<p>As Elizabeth aged, the question of the English succession became
of increasing interest to Europe, and as Mary's political
importance increased, Pope, Spain, and France alike forgot her
tainted reputation, which years of imprisonment might be supposed
to gloss over. France, however, abandoned Mary by the Treaty of
Blois, and the desperate captive willed her rights in England to
Philip of Spain in return for his assistance in obtaining her
freedom. This letter was intercepted by the vigilant Walsingham,
and it was then decided by Burleigh, if not by Elizabeth, to
destroy Mary. An elaborate scheme of judicial murder was evolved;
Walsingham patiently spun the web of the Babington conspiracy, and
Mary, ill, hopeless, and frantic, and too remote from public
affairs to be prudent, fell into the trap. She dictated a letter to
Babington, which gave consent to a rising on her behalf, and
tacitly agreed to an attempt on the life of Elizabeth (1586).</p>

<p>Mary, so ill that she could not walk alone, was brought before
an imposing Commission of Elizabeth's peers. The forlorn and
helpless woman defended herself with spirited skill, but without
evoking compassion, before the judges determined to destroy her.
She was found guilty and sentenced to die by the axe. Elizabeth,
ill from emotion, tried to put off the execution, or at least to
evade responsibility for it, but Burleigh was resolute in the
pursuance of his policy. There is no reason to believe that
Elizabeth was animated by vindictive feelings, or that her
reluctance to put Mary to death was feigned. The Queen, Burleigh,
and the majority of the nation honestly regarded Mary as a
murderess, a wanton, a liar, and a woman continuously plotting to
murder Elizabeth and restore the tyranny of Rome by the force of
foreign arms.</p>

<p>With formal ceremonial Mary was beheaded in the great Hall of
Fotheringay, February 7th, 1587. Her noble dignity, her touching
farewells to her devoted servants, her lofty fortitude and unshaken
fidelity to her faith, her splendid appearance&mdash;all infirmities and
blasted beauty being disguised by rich attire and artful feminine
devices&mdash;moved the spectators of this awful scene to respect, if
not to sympathy. But the news of the death of the Scottish Queen
was received with bell-ringing and bonfires in London and with
great rejoicings all over the country. It was generally believed
that the newly won and not wholly consolidated liberty of England
had been rescued from a great peril.</p>

<p>The Protestant James VI assented to his mother's death in his
eagerness to become King of England. When that ambition was
achieved (1603) he had his mother's body (1612) brought from
Peterborough Cathedral, where her coffin had lain near to that of
Catherine of Aragon, and placed under a handsome monument near to
that of Queen Elizabeth in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>Mary, Queen of Scots, died without having, by a single word,
thrown any light on any of the mysteries of her life that have been
subjects of such keen controversy for so long. There will always be
painful and probably fruitless debate over Mary's conduct as a
woman and a Queen. Immediately after her death she became a martyr
in the eyes of many of her own Faith, and as such was elevated
almost to the position of a saint. Even to those who do not invest
her with mythical qualities, her charm, her suffering, her famous
name, and most of all, the tragedy of her death, will always give
her a romantic importance that is enhanced by the apparently
insoluble puzzles presented by her conduct during her brief reign.
This is, from the historian's point of view, a mere episode in the
story of Scotland that did not affect the development of that
nation one way or another; neither the Queen herself, nor Rizzio,
nor Darnley, nor Bothwell, was more than a passionate child of
chance and circumstance. None of them believed in, or strove for,
large issues, or for any but selfish aims, but because this woman
was Mary Stewart and because these men were singled out by her
regard, they have a certain but brittle immortality, the useless
brilliancy and the guarded permanency of a jewel in a shrine, which
in itself is nothing but a lustrous shining, but which may be
symbolic of anything that the spectator chooses to invoke.</p>

<p>Mary, in herself, was something less than a Queen, yet is
something more than a figure in the history books; she is always
doubled by her legend, as a flower or a star may be doubled in
water or glass. Not the least fascination of her story is the
wonder of it, the sense of exasperation that it raises in the mind;
the tantalising possibilities, the bewildering questions provoked
by the two murders and the two marriages, the lovely figure of the
woman whom so many praised and none helped, who had no weapon
beyond her tears and no buckler beyond her pride, and was fortunate
in nothing save in the cruel death that dimmed all her faults.</p>

Portrait of Robert Spencer in classical dress.<br>
By Carlo Maratta ((1640-1702)</p>
</div>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">
LORD SUNDERLAND sat in the Groote Kerk at Utrecht. His figure,
in straight-cut black, was indistinguishable from all those other
figures in straight-cut black, and his face he kept hidden in his
hand, as he bowed forward in an attitude of devotion.</p>

<p>But his hand betrayed him; there was none other so elegant and
sensitive among that austere congregation.</p>

<p>Long, tedious, heavy, the sermon hummed on without rise or fall
in the voice of the speaker. The vast whitewashed space of the
mutilated church was filled by the colourless light of afternoon,
which streamed blankly through the huge plain-glass windows.</p>

<p>To right and left, before and behind my lord, were rows of
Dutchmen in dark clothes, with severe faces, and Dutchwomen in dark
clothes with severe faces. These all gazed unflinchingly at the
preacher and never at the Earl, though there could hardly have been
a greater curiosity than this English nobleman who had been so
great, so loathed&mdash;a Romanist, a persecutor of the Protestants, an
accomplice in all the hot designs of his master, King James of
England, against the Reformed Church, most exquisite, skilful, and
unscrupulous of courtiers and statesmen, now fallen, exiled and
again an apostate, for my lord had not shrunk from abjuring
Catholicism and joining the rigid Church of Calvin&mdash;no one in so
short a time, or with so much ease and grace, had run from the
Jesuits to Geneva.</p>

<p>Once a leader of every fashion and accomplishment, my lord was
now dressed like a Dutch burgher, with profound simplicity, in
utter drab plainness.</p>

<p>When the service was over and the close-packed pews emptied, as
long, decorous streams of quiet people filed out of the white
interior of the church into the serene sunshine of the slumbering
afternoon, then many did venture a glance of cold inquisitiveness
at the exiled statesman who bore himself so meekly among them.</p>

<p>My lord remained till the last, sighing now and then, and often
keeping that beautiful hand, as if in an access of devotion, before
his face.</p>

<p>The Pastor came down from the cumbrous pulpit and greeted his
illustrious convert. The caressing manners of my lord, which had
fascinated two Kings, had won the Calvinist preacher; grim and
narrow as he was, he flushed with pleasure at the sight of my
lord's penitence, which had been wrought by his own eloquence.</p>

<p>The two left the church together.</p>

<p>My lord was not young, but of an exceedingly pleasing presence.
His fineness could not be hidden by his harsh dress; it required
all his tact, all his art to nullify the impression of smiling
cynicism, of irony that was given by his delicate, thrice-refined
features.</p>

<p>The Pastor, with a crude curiosity, asked my lord if he did not
regret his gorgeous Palace at Althorp, the crowded splendours of
St. James's and the great appointments he had had.</p>

<p>Then my lord, who was yet called by the London people "Popish
dog" and "Judas," said no, that his heart was now so touched by
divine grace that the loss of all his worldly honours was as
nothing to him, that his exile was sweetened and his afflictions
were solaced by the discovery of the truth of the dogmas of the
Calvinistic religion.</p>

<p>"Yet," said the Pastor, with a shudder, "I have heard it said
that you, sir, did once, in public, deny the existence of a God at
all?"</p>

<p>"If you knew me a little better," smiled the Earl sweetly, "you
would know that I am incapable of such&mdash;indiscretion"&mdash;he murmured
this last word into his handkerchief and said aloud
instead&mdash;"blasphemy."</p>

<p>"It did," replied the Pastor heavily, "seem to me
incredible."</p>

<p>They parted near the renowned "Paille Maille," where my lord had
his modest lodgings, and the Earl, gracefully detaining the
Dutchman on the threshold of the little gabled house, thanked him
most winningly for the edification afforded by his sermon.</p>

<p>My lady was within, seated alone in the dark and formal
room.</p>

<p>Like my lord, she had disguised the remains of lustrous beauty
by a puritanical dress. She was making tea and sighing over a
packet of letters&mdash;the last letters from home.</p>

<p>The Earl put down his high-crowned hat; the two ruined exiles
regarded each other.</p>

<p>On the mantel-shelf was a sketch of my lord in his youth; my
lady always carried it about with her. It was a drawing in pencil
by the Abbate Maratti for the picture at Althorp painted when my
lord was in Italy. He had been taken in a classic dress and the
full flower of his beauty. Nothing could have been a greater
contrast than this sketch and my lord's present appearance in his
Dutch garments.</p>

<p>"I do not know," said the Countess, "how I shall well bear
it."</p>

<p>"Fie," replied my lord with his soft smile, "it is very amusing.
If you can learn to sleep with your eyes open and sitting upright,
you may have a fair enjoyment in a Dutch church. Utrecht is the
most amiable of cities. Besides, we shall not be here long."</p>

<p>"It is impossible that we can return to England."</p>

<p>My lord lifted his delicate brows. He thought that if he had
managed two English Kings he might contrive to manage a third, but
he did not remark on this, even to his wife; instead he drank his
tea (a luxury of which the exiles had to be careful) in silence,
and gazed with irony at that sketch of his blooming youth that was
so incongruous in this setting.</p>

<h3>OVERIJSSEL</h3>

<a id="pic9"></a>

title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Overijssel: Giethorn, 1917.<br>
By Bernard Bueninck (1864-1933)</p>
</div>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="quote"><i>"In omnibus requiem quaesivi et nusquam
inveni nisi in Angelo cum libello."</i><p>
<br>
&mdash;Motto under the Picture of Thomas  Kempis, formerly at
Zwolle.</p>

<p class="first">
OVERIJSSEL, unlike Drenthe, which was not considered of
sufficient importance to be represented on the States-General, was
one of the original seven Provinces of the North, the remnant that
William the Silent wrested from Spain, that portion of the
Netherlands where, as he said, he "would go and find a grave."</p>

<p>There are three of the most attractive towns in the Netherlands
in Overijssel, Kampen, Deventer, and Zwolle, a charming castle,
Rechteren, and a very pleasant and lush stretch of country with
water villages such as Giethoorn, which, though inaccessible, are
in danger of becoming an attraction for tourists.</p>

<p>Like Friesland, Groningen, and Zeeland, Overijssel is best
visited by boat, one's own boat, but if this is not possible, the
country, which still has a very out-of-the-way air, may be visited
by road, rail, motor or cycle. It is not, however, difficult to
hire boats and boatmen, and the peculiar flavour of such a journey
among these waterways is one not lightly to be forgone.</p>

<p>The peat fields of the Drenthe merge into the reedy marshes, the
luscious meadows, the noble sheets of water of Overijssel, which on
the other side runs into the spacious moors of Guelders.</p>

<p>Meppel, a quiet town, really in the Drenthe, is a starting place
for many expeditions into Overijssel and Hasselt. Zwartsluis and
Genemuiden set off the broad waters of the Meppeler Diep, which
divides at Zwartsluis to run down to Zwolle and across into the
Zwolsche Diep, which empties into the Zuyder Zee opposite the
minute islands of Urk and Schokland.</p>

<p>The roads run on the high, artificial banks that edge the water
(the land is here at the utmost but a few inches above the level of
the sea) and the groups that pass to and fro are outlined
distinctly in the crystal clarity of the air, against the changing
panorama of the vast sky. The country is often entirely under water
here, all farms, churches and buildings being raised on mounds.
Rows of windmills work incessantly draining the land, and their
eager energy is in sharp contrast to the extreme placidity of the
landscape.</p>

<p>These windmills are disappearing in favour of those run by
electricity, but a happy movement is at present on foot to preserve
these faithful ancient servants of the Netherlands, not only for
sentimental affections, on account of tradition and the rare beauty
of their shape and colour, but for another and touching reason.</p>

<p>Electricity means coal, and coal has to come from abroad; if,
through any European disturbance this vital supply was stopped, the
country would be under water in a few days&mdash;unless these loyal
allies, the windmills, were there ready to resume their duties.</p>

<p>One heartily hopes that patriotism will save from destruction a
feature of the flat landscape that is so lovely, so apt, so deeply
associated with the very life of the country, so honoured by many
great painters.</p>

<p>Without the windmills it would be more difficult to defend the
Netherland scenery against the charge of dullness which the
indifferent traveller so often brings.</p>

<p>These solitary, still waters have another beauty besides the
windmills&mdash;the quantities of wild swans which dwell among the beds
of stiff reeds.</p>

<p>The birds are protected by the authorities and nest and breed in
security in these lonely sheets of water and patches of water
grass. The rich white of the immaculate plumage, the superb
movement of the sailing bird, the vivid black of beak and eye are
thrown up against this flat background of blue-green melting into
mauve purples with an effect of poignant loveliness.</p>

<p>Among all the delectable pictures offered in this country of
fine lines, flat horizons, immense skies, and vivid details, none
is more beautiful than this of the Overijssel swans among the
solitary clumps of reeds, on the lonely stretches of water beneath
the lofty expanse of the sky and the ever-changing shapes of the
clouds.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>In the upper part of Overijssel, towards Friesland, the most
notable town is Steenwyck, which has a robust little history of its
own. It is more interesting than Meppel, and is, like that town and
Koevorden, situated on the borders between Drenthe and Overijssel.
While Koevorden is in the former Province, however, Steenwyck and
Meppel are in Overijssel, at least technically.</p>

<p>It is situated on the river Aa, the name of so many streams
hereabouts, and built, as an old chronicler says pleasantly, in the
form of a bow. Always one of the least important towns of
Overijssel, yet the church is one of the most important in the North
of the Low Countries, a grandiose building originally dedicated to
Saint Clement and dating from the twelfth century. Of course it has
been destroyed, rebuilt, patched, and mutilated, and remains only a
fragment, bare and whitewashed within, and shattered and
incomplete-looking without.</p>

<p>Another relic is the church once known as that of Our Lady,
rebuilt in 1477, and in recent times carefully restored. Steenwyck
is a town of many sieges. In 1552 it was besieged in vain by Count
de Meurs, in 1553 carried by assault by the troops of Charles V,
and the ancient castle razed to the ground, but the siege that made
Steenwyck famous in the annals of valiant deeds was that during the
War of Independence in 1580, when the Count de Renneberg invested
the town with six thousand foot and twelve companies of horse
soldiers.</p>

<p>The Dutch garrison consisted of but six hundred soldiers and
three hundred male citizens, of whom no more than half could be
relied on as regards loyalty to their commanders. Four years after
the siege an account of it was written by one Remigo Fresinga and
published at Deventer by Fridsert of Kampen. This is epic in style
and minute in detail, and abounds in those episodes of a kind of
ferocious headlong heroism in which these Northern stalwarts
delighted.</p>

<p>There is the story of "Arent of Groningen, son of a brewer," who
leaped from the ramparts into the moat, one October night, to
extinguish a barrel of tar and sulphur which the enemy had
succeeded in floating to the town gates, and contrived, under a
heavy fusillade, to do so and return in safety, shouting defiance
at the enemy. There is the account of two captains, one of each
army, who challenged each other and fought on the ramparts in the
old style of single combat, in full view of garrison and besiegers,
and many another such vehement deed, which reveals, through the
dust of history, the high, hard passions of those bitter times.</p>

<p>The commanders of the Dutch were Cornput and Olthof, and it is
said of the former that when in the Market Square (still much the
same, and peaceful enough now) an angry starving crowd was
demanding the surrender of the town, three partridges fell into
their midst, and Cornput was quick to improve the occasion by
remarking that this was a message from God, implying that help
would come in three weeks.</p>

<p>As, of course, it did, or the story would not have been told.
After a four months' siege Colonel Norrits, at the head of the army
of the young Republic, contrived to send into the desperate little
town cheeses, bread and powder; a few days later Renneberg raised
the siege.</p>

<p>The resources of Steenwyck were, however, exhausted, plague
invaded the thinned ranks of the inhabitants, and the following
year the town fell easily to the Spanish commander, Verdugo.</p>

<p>After ten years of Spanish rule Steenwyck was retaken by the
resplendent Maurice of Orange, and it is pleasant to know that
Captain Olthof and other veterans of the 1580 siege now served
under the young Prince who came to deliver Steenwyck.</p>

<p>As a result of this struggle Steenwyck was almost razed to the
ground, so that it is difficult to find there any old houses. In
1672 Steenwyck shared the humiliation of so many Netherlandish
towns, and was occupied by foreign troops, those, in this case, of
the Bishop of Mnster, who, after exacting ransom, abandoned the
town the following year.</p>

<p>To-day Steenwyck has a most placid, even bucolic appearance. Her
trade is in grain and butter, and where the fierce Calvinists and
the grim Spanish tramped to and fro in their beleaguerings and
fights, there is a peaceful procession of peasants and carts, gay,
cheerful, and innocent with the most idyllic of products, golden
butter, golden corn from the lush meadows and generous wheatfields
that surround Steenwyck.</p>

<p>There is a little Weigh House of 1642, a very pleasant and
appropriate structure, charmingly grave and practical.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Deventer, on the Yssel, is the other side of the Province,
towards Guelders, and one of the most attractive of towns.</p>

<p>The situation, on the broad and busy river edged with wharves
and crowded with shipping, is in itself noble and handsome, and
allows for one of those views from the opposite bank which is such
a pleasing way of seeing a town.</p>

<p>It is indeed one of the most satisfactory features of these
Dutch cities that they do permit of these complete "views" like an
old map, print, or painting. The town shows self-contained,
beginning and ending within definite limits, usually encircled by
old ramparts, gardens, bouquets of trees, a moat, a river or a
canal, not straggling away into slums, suburbs or "villa"
residences, as do so many famous towns in other parts of Europe,
until all charm, identity and individuality are obliterated.</p>

<p>There are very few of these Dutch towns that do not still retain
a distinct, precise personality, a compact personality, like the
towns drawn by Drer, by Van Goyen, by Van Eyck, by Ver Meer.</p>

<p>In the case of Deventer, this elegant distinction is very
noticeable. The quays, the old walls, the grand flow of the river,
the lofty trees, all surround the roofs, towers and belfries of the
ancient town, in the most imposing and graceful way possible, while
the tall steeples of the episcopal city can be seen for miles
dominating the landscape, and the twisting length of the renowned
river, bordered by delicious villages like Hattum, Veessen, Olst,
Diepenveen, Nijbroek, and Terwolde, lying so attractively among
pretty groves and reflected so prettily in the still waters of the
Yssel.</p>

<p>The remains of the first fortifications of Deventer are those of
the magnificent brick wall which repulsed the onslaught of the
Burgundians in 1457, when Philip the Good attacked the town upon
the refusal of Deventer to acknowledge his son, the Bishop of
Utrecht, as overlord. The intervention of the neighbouring Duke of
Guelders saved the town from the consequences of this temerity.</p>

<p>During the struggle with Spain, Deventer was Dutch and
Protestant in word and deed. In 1586 the Earl of Leicester forced
the town to receive a garrison of twelve hundred men, much against
the will of the citizens, who preferred to trust to their own
militia.</p>

<p>The said garrison consisted of those people dreaded in those
days under the name of "wild Irish," and their commander was an
impudent adventurer who had contrived to flatter Leicester into
this preferment. He was Edward Stanley, recently knighted for lusty
bravery on the ramparts of Bergen.</p>

<p>He promptly sold Deventer to Colonel Taxis, the Spanish
commander, and the town remained under Spanish rule till retaken by
Maurice in 1591. Through the treachery of Governor Steeke it fell
to the Bishop of Mnster in 1672, but cut a valiant figure when
attacked by the French in 1813.</p>

<p>Despite this warlike history, Deventer remains singularly rich
in ancient buildings, and is more interesting and delightful to the
antiquarian than, perhaps, any town in the country.</p>

<p>Deventer is very ancient, dating back, some say, to A.D. 130 but
certainly a well-established town by the eleventh century.</p>

<p>A certain Saint Lievin (Lebuines), who died in Deventer in A.D.
770, gives his name to two of the churches here, one the Cathedral,
the other once more Roman Catholic.</p>

<p>This was built by Ernulphe, Bishop of Utrecht, in 1046, and
rebuilt in 1235 and 1334. This last building, though altered and
enlarged, is still in existence. The belfry, with the mottoes
raised aloft like a sermon to the birds, is of 1613 and incongruous
enough, yet not without individuality and effect.</p>

<p>The crypt remains as it was built by the Bishop of Utrecht in
1046, and contains some superb columns of twisted and chevron
pattern, but these crypts are dark and sad enough, and however
intense the interest of these subterranean relics, it is not
without some shudder of relief that one gains the upper air.</p>

<p>Saint Lievin's has been, of course, whitewashed. Where this has
peeled away pictures of devils and the torments of hell have been
revealed. One thinks the whitewash preferable; it has a character,
an association of its own, not lightly to be dismissed. The light
and shade on the white spaces are lovely and have inspired many
lovely pictures. The present ardour to uncover these crude daubs
which possess nothing but an historic value is laudable enough, but
since nothing can give these great Gothic churches their pristine
splendour, surely it is wiser to leave them as monuments to
Calvinism and the War of Independence.</p>

<p>A utilitarian clock with dials, stuck in the top of the four
windows of the mutilated (or unfinished) tower, is a touch that
might be removed.</p>

<p>The iconoclast has spared, by accident probably, a mural tomb to
a certain Johann van Leyden (not the unhappy tailor prophet) and
his wife, a few long, slab tombs and a portion of a Renaissance
screen. For the rest, you must be content with the noble
proportions and graceful lines of the aisles and columns.</p>

<p>The other Saint Lievin's, a small brick church, dates from 1338,
and was Calvinist from 1579 to 1803. It used to be known as the
Broeder Kerk, and formed part of a monastery, probably that of an
Order founded by Eleanor of England in 1335, and named the
Recollects.</p>

<p>St. Nicholas's, the Berg Kerk, once belonged to the
Praemonstraten monks, the powerful Order which founded the Abbey at
Middelburg. This church, "St. Nicholas of the Mountain," stands on
a gentle rise, remarkable enough to have been termed "mountain" in
this flat country. The twin towers, flat and many-windowed, one
disfigured by a cap, are surmounted by pointed, cap-like spires
which are curious and distinctive.</p>

<p>St. Nicholas is old enough, built 1128 by a Bishop of Utrecht,
though date and Bishop vary according to the chronicler. It would
be the work of years to verify all these distant dates and
personages, which fluctuate considerably in histories and
guide-books.</p>

<p>Nor do they much matter; it is sufficient, for instance, that
the Berg Kerk is Romanesque without, whitewash within.</p>

<p>Eleanor of England, wife of a Duke of Guelders, is supposed to
lie buried, or once to have been buried, here, but there is no
trace and no memory of her resting-place, which has probably long
been, not the Berg Kerk, but the four corners of the earth.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>There are some gorgeous little buildings in Deventer, and the
chief of these is the Weigh House on the Market Square or
<i>Brink,</i> built in 1528 from the materials and on the design of
two old houses that stood on this site. The irregularity given by
the tower one side and the tourelle the other, the fine brick and
bands of plaster, the open ornamentation of the balustrades, the
pointed roof, coquettish turret and delicate spires, together with
the fine double staircase added in 1643, made the little Weigh
House (now a gymnasium) most entrancingly rich and fantastic, a toy
conceived by a poet.</p>

<p>Yet the people who erected this jewel of a building could boil
coiners of false money, as is shown by the copper pot once used for
this purpose and still hung on the walls.</p>

<p>A coiner was boiled to death at Lille in 1560, and in the
archives describing the events there is a drawing of the ghastly
punishment.</p>

<p>The ornaments of the Weigh House, on a close inspection, reveal
that grotesqueness without which any Gothic building, however late,
seems incomplete. There is the sun, with attendant moon and stars,
and two fantastic figures, <i>Kijk pot</i> and <i>Kijk uit de
pot,</i> one looking in and the other looking out of the pot&mdash;an
ugly fellow glancing into a cauldron, and then glancing away. The
meaning of this seems to have been forgotten, even in Deventer. One
might guess that it referred to trade, commerce, prosperity,
plenty&mdash;"the pot is empty, the pot is filled."</p>

<p>The Weigh House was at one time a kind of Exchange or
meeting-place of the merchants, in the old, robust, money-making
days when Deventer was a member of the Hansa League, and the
handsome little building must have been thronged with the notables
of the town.</p>

<p>On the Square in front, which is now so charming and delightful,
many heretics were burnt under the sombre rule of the Spanish.</p>

<p>Among the delicious houses, Renaissance, Gothic, "Louis XIV" as
interpreted in the Low Countries that surround the <i>Brink,</i>
there is one most uncommonly curious, only one storey high, which
seems to consist only of an immense roof, an immense door, rococo
scrolls, and above all a pinnacle crowned by a huge human head.</p>

<p>A "free Weigh House" was a gift from Floris V to the city, which
later received special privileges from the Emperor Henry V.</p>

<p>There are some charming step-gabled houses round the
<i>Brink,</i> and an old inn, where the Provincial Deputies used to
meet, and which is therefore called the <i>Land huffs,</i> has some
splendid Renaissance doors, heavy, comfortable, and florid, and a
statue of a warrior, supposed to be Charles V. Some of the other
portions of the building, which is now a police station, date from
the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The Stadhuis is of 1693, pre-eminently Dutch, Calvinist, and
prosperous. The bright, crude tints of the painted wooden shields
of the arms of the ancient guilds have a peculiarly attractive
appearance against the whitewashed walls.</p>

<p>The main treasures here are the Terborch painting and the
library and archives. The library is largely from the suppressed
Academy of Harderwijk, half of which went to Arnhem, and half to
Deventer. This collection contains many rare and precious MSS.;
there are also some very early printed books, dating from the time
that Rykert Paffroed and Jacob van Breda worked at their two
precious presses (about 1470) in Deventer.</p>

<p>The archives are particularly well kept and particularly
interesting, Deventer having been the capital of the Province and
an episcopal city.</p>

<p>There is also a fragment left of the Mint tower, where formerly
all the coinage for Overijssel was struck, and a wonderful baroque
house of 1735 adorned with statues, vases, scrolls, and ornaments
in a very welter of prodigality, yet, nevertheless, successful, as
this Netherlandish "Louis XIV" so often is. This bastard style of
florid, riotous, and yet formal ornament, suits the severe and yet
rich character of these old Dutch towns, and seems to express the
prosperity of a well-fed merchant more adequately than the glory of
spendthrift noble.</p>

<p>Deventer is no place for a hurried visit; it contains a wealth
of beauty, of charm, of association not easily exhausted, and the
surroundings (dealing here only with those which lie on the
Overijssel side of the river, which is the boundary between that
Province and Guelders) are most romantic and poetic.</p>

<p>The noble avenues of oak and elm, the luscious meadows, castles
like Hoenlo and De Haere, the cream-coloured church of Olst, the
lovely tower of Wyhe, Raalte, among the bracken and heather&mdash;all
these have an endearing delight about them, something that seems to
have a part in memory, in yearning, even in nostalgia. The beauty
of sky and river and distant, melancholy horizon, the beauty of
luxuriant avenues, long brick roads and terraces and mansions and
cottages and farms, all lovingly raised from the drained flat, the
beauty of a poignant tradition of a past that seems somehow to have
been undisturbed&mdash;all these affect the traveller through the summer
or autumn landscape of Overijssel with a sleepy, sad pleasure.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>It must not be forgotten that Deventer has not escaped modern
prosperity and the resultant ugliness; very famous carpets are made
here, and that honey cake which is a national delicacy, also
wine&mdash;the native wine being a great pride of the local inns.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Three of the extraordinary company of great men who came from
the Netherlands are claimed by Deventer: Gerrit Groot, Jacob Gronov
or Gronovius, and Gerard Terborch, often called Terberg.</p>

<p>The family of Gronovius, or Gronov, came originally from
Hamburg, where Johann Friedrich was born in 1611 or 1613. He was
celebrated as an antiquarian and classical scholar, and after many
travels became professor at Deventer. His son, Jacob, was born at
Deventer in 1645. His travels, his learning, his editions of the
classics were as extensive, profound and varied as those of his
father. He died at Leyden in 1716. The brother of this worthy,
Theodor, was also dowered with almost incredible erudition. An
account of his works reads almost like a satire on learning,
including, as it does, a work on the Pandects, notes on Vibius
Sequester, a dissertation on the marble base of the Colossus of
Tiberius, and a correspondence with Antonio Magliabecci, librarian
to Cosmo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and a prodigy of memory and
learning, who after one reading of a book could write it down
verbatim, spent day and night in his study without taking off his
clothes and lived on hard-boiled eggs and water.</p>

<p>There is a fantastic picturesqueness about this squalid
personage, who appears like some gnome born of the union of leather
and parchment and suckled on printers' ink, but the Gronoviuses
were prosaic and amiable pedants whose enormous learning,
unenlivened by wit, humour or imagination, seems now as vain as it
was prodigious. Three sons of Jacob Gronovius adorned the
eighteenth century and the town of Leyden with their scholarly
gifts and patient research.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>A more interesting son of Deventer is Gerrit Groot (Gerard the
Great), who "flourished," as the old biographies say, in the
fourteenth century, being born at Deventer in 1340.</p>

<p>He began with portentous learning, taking his M.A. at the
Sorbonne and lecturing on philosophy and theology at Cologne.</p>

<p>Retiring for a while into a Carthusian monastery, he returned to
the world for the purpose of inducing others to leave it, and, clad
in miserable raiment, began preaching in the streets.</p>

<p>In this crude, fiery, and sincere age these methods never failed
of considerable effect, and Gerrit found himself with a numerous
following.</p>

<p>Returning to Deventer, he opened a kind of office, where several
people were employed in transcribing copies of the Scriptures and
the Early Fathers for diffusion among the vulgar; an enterprise
which in those pre-printing days involved no little toil.</p>

<p>Gerrit formed this nucleus of faithful copyists into a society,
which he called Brethren of the Common Life <i>(Fratres Vitae
Communis),</i> and which was approved formally by Gregory XI in
1376.</p>

<p>These brothers spread all over the Low Countries and Germany.
They were divided into two classes, the literate, copyists, or
teachers, and the illiterate, who performed the manual labours of
the community; the society sounds agreeable enough and must have
been useful, too, before the spread of the printing press rendered
needless such ingenuous labours.</p>

<p>Gerrit Groot died in Deventer in 1384, leaving one gentle and
simple memory the more to the pretty little town.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Our last notability is more flamboyant than either Jacob
Gronovius or Gerrit Groot, being no less than Gerard Terborch, who,
though born at Zwolle, was a townsman of Deventer and died here in
1681.</p>

<p>He was one of the most flattered and celebrated painters of his
time, and if posterity has not quite confirmed the verdict of his
contemporaries, his work is at the least rich, distinguished, and
pleasing. He had travelled in Italy and visited Madrid and painted
the plenipotentiaries at the Peace of Mnster (1648) before he came
to Deventer to paint the Town Council and die, full of years and
honours, in his native Province. He had been already knighted by
Philip IV. His style, of conversations, suppers, and musical
parties, was followed by Metzu and Caspar Netscher, who improved on
him in elegance if not in vigour.</p>

<p>His pictures are always well-bred in tone, opulent in colour and
flowing in design. He excels in depicting textiles and in
particular white satin, which sumptuous material he contrives to
introduce into most of his pieces.</p>

<p>Pieter van Anraadt, Caspar Netscher, and Koet were among his
pupils at Deventer.</p>

<p>He had himself visited Haarlem for three years in his youth, and
the influence of Frans Hals is always noticeable in his pictures.
There is a charming genre picture in the Mauritshuis, "The
Dispatch" (No. 176), and a "Portrait of the Artist" (No. 177), a
delightful little full length in black with grey stockings and a
blond peruke. The Boymans Museum, Rotterdam, possesses a portrait
of a certain Johann Versnyden (No. 441), and Terborch's
masterpiece, "The Peace of Mnster," which contains sixty
portraits, is in the National Gallery, London. This is hardly a
pictorial success. Terborch has not been able to overcome a
difficulty which is indeed almost insuperable, that of introducing
variety and a broken line into a large official group of portraits.
The heads are nearly all on the same level and make a band of light
across the picture; the table adds another dark mass to a
composition too heavy already, and the few details, as the
candelabra, books, etc., are swamped in the general monotony.</p>

<p>However, the portraits are excellently rendered, with a fine and
expressive skill, and the group, painted at the solemn moment of
taking the oath, is not without impressiveness and grandeur. As an
historic document it is invaluable, of course, it might be termed
living history, and the figure of the man in the cloak to the
right, and the elegant cavalier in rich attire to the extreme left,
show what the artist could accomplish when freed from official
formula.</p>

<p>It was this picture, painted from life, which attracted the
attention of the Spanish Envoy, Count Peneranda, and the honours of
the Spanish visit. The "Peace of Mnster" or "Treaty of
Westphalia," as it was indifferently called, was for years a
favourite subject with Dutch painters, and this is the first and
most interesting of these celebrations of this famous event.</p>

<p>In the Stadhuis at Deventer there is, as is fitting, a "Council
Piece" by Terborch, containing eighteen portraits of Magistrates
and Secretaries, very exact and noble, and pleasing in colouring
despite the black gowns and sombre attire of these honest-faced
worthies.</p>

<p>Dresden possesses that little masterpiece, worth all the Council
pieces in the world, the sketch for the figure in "Paternal
Advice," the lady in the satin dress and exquisite pose, with her
face turned completely from the spectator. How expressive, how
gracious and altogether lovely, is this averted head and
turned-away figure!</p>

<p>Kampen, like Zwolle and Deventer, stands on the Yssel, but near
the mouth of the river, and directly opposite Edam, which is the
other side of that lost Province now covered by the Zuyder Zee.
Kampen is, in reality, one of the so-called "dead cities" of the
Zuyder Zee, its harbour having silted and long ago destroyed the
little town's prosperity, which reached a zenith in the fifteenth
century, when Kampen was a member of the Hansa League.</p>

<p>The town is as quiet, as clean, as attractive as its neighbours,
and possesses as many beauties, churches, Stadhuis, and old gates.
To many this most out-of-the-way of the three Overijssel towns would
be the most delightful.</p>

<p>It makes the usual general view of grouped buildings, rising
from behind the river with the clustered water-craft, the
<i>tjalks</i> and peculiar barges of Overijssel, groups of the trees
and that superb background of windy clouds or pallid sky that so
often inspired native painters.</p>

<p>The Stadhuis is one of the most prized buildings in the country.
It is very old, but it was restored after the inevitable fire in
1543; but the chief glory of the faade, the statues, were rescued
from the earlier building and so are old enough. They represent
Charlemagne (or some say Charles V), Alexander the Great, and the
usual Fidelity and Justice, with the rare and welcome addition of
Moderation and Neighbourly Love.</p>

<p>The outline of the Stadhuis is ornate and fantastic, with the
usual white bands on brick, the tiny tourelle and large tower
crowning a bulbous belfry with a spire.</p>

<p>This Stadhuis possesses several curiosities, two of a sinister
kind&mdash;the grille where prisoners were exposed on the street for the
mockery of the passer-by, not altogether in accordance with those
figures of Moderation and Neighbourly Love, and a queer wooden
roll, upon which the sentences were written.</p>

<p>Of a most human interest are the handsome guild goblets and
bandoliers, and most gorgeous are the seats or stalls in the Court
House. These are the work of one Meister Vrederic (1546), who
almost overloaded his work with rich and elaborate detail. A
further example of opulence in excess is the chimney-piece by Jacob
Colyn de Nole (1545), where the carvings seem to crush and stifle
one another in luxuriant profusion.</p>

<p>The general effect of this chamber is, however, very notable and
imposing, and this over-ornamentation is more to be justified in a
public room, where an impression of stately pomp is to be created
and where no one stays very long, than in a dwelling-house, or even
a church, for this sumptuous decoration is neither domestic nor
religious in feeling.</p>

<p>The principal church is St. Nicholas's, an imposing, grandiose
edifice of the fourteenth century, with remains of much original
splendour, as the rood screen with brass balusters, the font and
bells, two of which date from 1482; and relics of a later age in
the brass candelabra with the town arms.</p>

<p>There is a very gorgeous organ (1670-1676) which claims (with
many others) to be the largest in the country.</p>

<p>There is also a Roman Catholic church, St. Mary's (or <i>Buiten
Kerk</i>), fourteenth century, and a peculiar tower, built between
the Bovenstad and Buitenstad ("above" and "without" the town) by
Philip Vinckhoorns in 1649-1664, as a landmark for ships; this is
called (curiously for those times) Tower of the Holy Ghost, or
Nieuwe Toren, and contains an excellent carillon of thirty-five
bells which sounds along the winding reaches of the Yssel out to
sea.</p>

<p>There is a tiny Romanesque church, St. Willem's (twelfth
century), and a Broeder Kerk (fifteenth century), the former
Minorite church, and, most noteworthy of all, the gates. One is
named the <i>Cellebroeders Poort</i> (1465), which bears the
Imperial Eagle which shows that Kampen was a free town, the Koren
Markt Poort, whitewashed so as to be visible to mariners
(marvellous the uses of whitewash in this practical country!) and
the Broeders Poort.</p>

<p>There are the proper medieval gates of history, legend and
romance, the kind that were closed at night, where the lonely
belated traveller knocked in vain, whose elegant spires were a
beloved guiding point over sea and land, whose broad archway
spanned the whole flow, up and down, of a busy town's
activities.</p>

<p>There is a dwelling-house over each, with latticed windows and
shutters snug beneath the gable and between the turrets, and here
the gatekeeper lived, and you may be sure that he had a blonde
daughter who watched the crowds below, and had a smile and maybe a
flower for one of them, and a moment to spare from her tiled
kitchen and her spinning-wheel to cast them down, smile and
blossom, down into the streets of Kampen, perhaps in an autumn
dusk, when the wind was up and the stout, ruddy sails tacking for
shelter and the black clouds racing across the moon.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Zwolle, now the capital of Overijssel, is on the Zwarte Water,
which falls into the Zuyder Zee, and is itself a tributary of the
Yssel. This rings the town like a moat and is planted with dense
fine trees and broad waters and gardens set with luxurious houses.
The town is, indeed, too prosperous and too quiet&mdash;not the quiet of
Kampen and Deventer, but, the visitor suspects, the quiet of very
well-to-do, retired somebodies, who do not mind being provincial
and being dull as long as they are comfortable.</p>

<p>In a number of Dutch towns one has a suspicion of too much
leisure, formality, and money in the bank on the part of many of
the inhabitants, not without a gloss of snobbishness (the Dutch
are, many of them, pretty good at <i>le snobisme</i>), and a rigid
dividing of themselves into sets and cliques&mdash;the "well born," the
"high born," and those born neither high nor well.</p>

<p>These defects, the result of too much virtue and too much time
on the part of the women, no doubt, are not without their amusing
side when discerned in a people once so keenly mercantile, so
fiercely Puritan, so doggedly Republican. Yet perhaps never quite
so definitely any of these things as has been popularly supposed.
One guesses that a coat of arms enjoyed full value and that a long
pedigree was extremely desirable even' in the most rigid days of
Their High Mightinesses the States-General.</p>

<p>These precisely kept houses, so dignified, so aloof, so
luxurious and so old-fashioned, seem to symbolise a life,
aristocratic and worthy, no doubt, from which the free-lance who
earns his living shrinks in dismay.</p>

<p>Imagine your ringing at one of those polished massive doors with
a hole in your glove, or without any gloves, or without a proper
introduction&mdash;or fancy, in fact, your ringing at all, and seeing
the Baron or Baroness, Jonkheer or Jonkfrau, glaring out of the
brilliant plate-glass window, between the spotless curtains, over
the gilt basket of tulips, to see who dared&mdash;no, the only possible
way to visit these houses would be by the back door (if there is
one), and so to creep into the kitchen, where the servants look fat
and kind and the cooking is excellent.</p>

<p>Let us hasten away from the freezing aspect of these stately
homes, which have too many counterparts in the country, and enter
the old town of Zwolle as an eager tourist in search of
"sights."</p>

<p>It is not, as you will have guessed from those select purlieus,
the Stad Gracht and Potgieter Singel, a manufacturing town, but
deals only in the pleasant products of the genteel country-side,
corn, cattle, and butter.</p>

<p>The town encircled by this moat, like the Stad Gracht, is round
as Middelburg, and centres, in correct fashion, about market place
and church.</p>

<p>There is one gate left, and that of imposing appearance, the
Sassen Poort, with five towers, now used for the housing of
archives.</p>

<p>The keeper of these archives works (if he does not live) in the
chamber above the gate, a romantic and wizard-like existence
indeed, shut in with old books, old parchments, and old memories in
the musty, ancient chambers of the five-towered gate. It is
satisfactory when one can find a veteran building put to some use
that makes it part of the life of to-day; and when that use is
dignified and appropriate, what could be more pleasant!</p>

<p>The heart of Zwolle is an irregular, small Market Square, one
side entirely occupied by the Church of St. Michael (Groote Kerk),
with in front a most uncommon addition in the shape of an
entrancing little guard-house of 1614, with a very decorative gilt
statue above. The church is of the fifteenth century, spacious and
stately, despite the usual mutilations and the medley of
architecture which encloses it. The noble proportions of the
church, which has been carefully and tastefully restored, rise
harmoniously above the incongruous little guard-house, the
odd-shaped market place, and the faades of the well-kept inns and
shops, all with an air of repose and gentility.</p>

<p>The interior of the church contains a pulpit which is
conspicuous even among the pulpits of the Netherlands, and an organ
distinguished even among Dutch organs.</p>

<p>After sweeping away or painting over every trace of Romanist
decoration, in many cases even chipping off the capitals of columns
or piercing them to accommodate a stove or pipe, after taking out
the coloured glass from the windows and providing them with green
curtains or blocking them up, after choking the interior with rows
of massive pews, footstools, and cushions for the comfort and
repose of the faithful, the Puritans proceeded to let themselves go
on an organ and a pulpit, on both of which they lavished the most
unlikely adornment and symbolism.</p>

<p>The peculiar effect of the churches thus treated is certainly
unique and extremely characteristic of a people, a country, an
epoch, a temperament. One would not like to see them changed; the
extraordinary atmosphere and, as it were, flavour of these
transformed cathedrals are too piquant, at once amusing and
touching, and, like the Dutch landscape, possessed of a spare,
severe, choice charm, bleak and pale, enriched by vivid details of
glowing colour and bold shape.</p>

<p>This organ is, no doubt, superb, and the organist has written a
book all about it, and will perform on it for a fee, to your mutual
satisfaction. It does not look in the least religious, though it
has never played anything but Church music, but seems that it
would, like its one-time fellow at Cannons, prefer to "waft the
soul upon a jig to Heaven," so florid and gay it is with the
comely, self-satisfied figures and all the scrolls and
traceries.</p>

<p>The pulpit is more restrained and elegant in style than usual.
The date is 1620, before the full bloom of riotous baroque; but
here, as in most pulpits, the over-elaboration of the
sounding-board is disastrous to the impressiveness and gravity of
the preacher, who loses all his dignity with this huge cover
suspended over him, which looks as if it would descend and
extinguish him, and at best dwarfs him completely.</p>

<p>The simple pulpit, or the niche door in the wall of the church
with a balustrade in front, gives more force and power to the
preacher and his words; but eloquence is possibly regarded as gaudy
by the Calvinists, and the pure flow of logic and the Word comes,
no doubt, well enough from under these monumental covers.</p>

<p>In the apse is a fine oak screen with brass balustrade that
somehow has escaped the iconoclast, and, more enticing than any of
these treasures, is an engaging clock which the neat, gnome-like
sacristan shows with modest pleasure. These Dutch sacristans and
their wives, always so quiet and tidy, with their homely smiles and
eager explanations, always seem like creatures out of a fairy-tale,
but are, of course, very real indeed, and keep the spotless church
swept and dusted and the glittering candelabra polished.</p>

<p>This clock is set in the wall, and is topped by a figure of St.
Michael with a sword, who strikes the bell for the hour.</p>

<p>The old man sets the little warrior at work again and again, you
hear all the hours of the day struck in succession from the tiny
sword, and the sacristan laughs with delight, not at the ingenious
toy he knows so well, but at your amusement and pleasure.</p>

<p>As you leave the church you see, with a sense of unlawful joy,
the stripped, shuttered, balustered <i>Hoofdwacht</i> (Guard
House), so impertinently flanking the long Gothic windows, so
deliciously out of place and in the right place at the same
time.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>There is a Town Museum at Zwolle, in a quiet old mansion, full
of quiet old relics. You must ring the bell to enter and the
custodian makes a ceremony of admitting you, and does not like you
to miss any of the exhibits, which include an odd medley, funeral
lamps, moulds for St. Nicholas cakes, Guild cups, an old Overijssel
room, and some admirable glass paintings that suddenly strike you
with envy and the lust of possession.</p>

<p>The three planes of a land- or sea-scape, foreground, middle
distance, and background, are painted on three different sheets of
glass, which are afterwards fitted, one behind the other, and
slightly apart, in a grooved frame. The effect is charming when the
picture is hung against the window and the light shows through the
luminous brown and yellow tones, and one visitor at least went away
with the hope of being able one day to find the skill and leisure
to produce an imitation.</p>

<p>Glass paintings, birds, flowers, and coats of arms on little
panels or circles to hang against windows are a pretty adornment in
many old Dutch houses, but these of treble glass are something
out-of-the-way and queerly delightful. In the garden, at the back
of this tranquil storehouse of relics, are marshalled stone pumps
and sundials with a disconsolate, pensioned air, no one troubling
them for either water or the time, handles and dial pointers being
alike broken or out of use. To some garden or square each of these
would be an adornment; here they are but a <i>memento mori</i> many
times repeated reminding us both of water and time that have flowed
away for ever.</p>

<p>Standing hardily off the main street of Zwolle is a more
fortunate pump, lusty and substantial, with bulging, portly body
and still in use.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Close to Zwolle is the most splendid residence in Overijssel and
one of the most splendid in the country&mdash;Castle Rechteren. A
succession of travellers has borne witness to the noble courtesy of
the princely owners, who maintain the tradition of the courtesy in
the grand manner of the Dutch nobility.</p>

<p>The present castle is of the prosperous seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, but the original building was of great
antiquity. The last of the founder family, Luitgarde van Rechteren,
married, in 1330, Frederic van Heckeren van der Ehze, who took the
name of Rechteren, and whose descendants still possess the castle
as Counts of Rechteren-Limberg.</p>

<p>Many a stiff fight did the stout castle maintain with Bishops of
Utrecht, with burghers of Zwolle, with the Spanish, and finally
with Prince Maurice himself, who drained the moat and dismantled
the walls.</p>

<p>One of the lords of Rechteren, Adolph, was a friend of the last
Duke of Guelders, and held the castle in his interest. When Charles
was captured by the citizens of Zwolle, one of the articles of his
release provided for the dismantling of Rechteren. This promise was
made, but not, of course, kept.</p>

<p>A Van Rechteren was one of the plenipotentiaries at that Peace
of Utrecht, which finally disposed of the designs of Louis XIV on
the Netherlands, and his fine tomb may be seen in the church at
Almelo.</p>

<p>Rechteren, as it stands at present, is that engaging mixture of
styles which comprises so many of these <i>slot</i> and
<i>kasteel</i> of the Netherlands&mdash;the moat, the bridge, the carved
pieces and gable stones with coats of arms, the step-gabled fronts,
the round tower with the cupola, the steep roof with the little
hooded windows, the terraces, steps, gardens <i>de broderie,</i>
and formal walks and trees, all very solid, sumptuous, and
individual. In this lusty-looking tower cannon balls are embedded
and in places the walls are six feet thick. The luxurious interior
of the castle also contains warlike reminders of battles and
sieges&mdash;swords, halberts, and such weapons which have been found
scattered in the grounds where now the trim flowers blow in exact
parterres. The palimpsest has long since been covered up; these
ancient days hidden, the elegant refinement of later centuries,
comfort and prosperity succeeding to conflict and rapine. The early
eighteenth-century stables, the 1683 terrace and steps, the 1725
frontage have well-nigh obliterated the appearance of the fierce
old castle where men tussled so desperately, and the atmosphere is
now more of leisurely tea-cups and satin-gowned gossip, of gilt
cabriolets rattling over the bridge, of slender hounds held in
leash by a long-coated page, than of any turbulent struggle of
Bishop or Duke, Spaniard or burgher.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>One notable man, and he of world fame, is associated with
Zwolle, Thomas  Kempis, author of that beloved and cherished book,
<i>De Imitatione Christi.</i></p>

<p>His name was really Thomas Hamerken of Kempen, not the Kampen so
near here, but Kempen near Cologne, and he was born in 1380. He
went early to the Grammar School at Deventer, where he came into
touch with an order or society founded by Gerrit Groot, which had a
considerable influence upon him.</p>

<p>Before long the pious and mystic "Brethren of the Common Life"
had enrolled Thomas among their number, and for seven years he
resided in scholarly retirement in Deventer copying the Scriptures
for the benefit of the common fund.</p>

<p>An obscure monastery, that of Agnietenberg (St. Agnes), received
the spiritual, quiet, and ecstatic copyist as monk and sub-prior,
and there he spent many, many sweetly monotonous days, engaged in
meditation, prayer, and the exercise of his delicate copying, which
last he regarded even as Fra Angelico regarded his pictures, as an
offering to the Lord. He died in his tranquil cloister in 1471,
ninety-one years old.</p>

<p>He left behind him many examples of his beautiful skill as a
caligrapher, a Bible in four volumes, an elaborate Mass book,
several works by St. Bernard, and the famous <i>De Imitatione
Christi,</i> of which last he produced several copies.</p>

<p>This work first appeared, without the name of the author, before
the Council of Constance in 1415, and the dispute as to the
authorship still rages, some claiming that it was written by Jean
Gerson, Chancellor of Paris, and merely copied by Thomas 
Kempis.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, here tradition, true or not, seems good
enough. It is such a book as a gentle, cloistered mystic monk
should and would have written, if he could; and why not grant him
his masterpiece, which seems so exactly like the fruit of
monotonous convent days enlivened by an intense inner spiritual
life?</p>

<p>Two manuscripts of this precious composition remain in the
lovely writing of Thomas  Kempis. One is at Louvain, and one at
Antwerp.</p>

<p>In the Roman Catholic church of St. Michael's, in Zwolle, is a
monument (1867) to Thomas  Kempis, and on the site of the
monastery is a monolith to his memory, rather heavy and dour and
too much like a tombstone, which boldly claims <i>De Imitatione</i>
for Thomas, without any hint at a possible dispute about the
honour.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The Stadhuis of Zwolle is a disappointment. It is of 1447, but
the exterior was modernised at a most unhappy period, 1844. It
contains a fine Gothic room and some carved roof-supports supposed
to be caricatures of the Councillors of Kampen, this town appearing
to have had a queer reputation, like that of the mythical
Gotham.</p>

<p>On the house of a certain gentleman, a Baron Van der Capellen,
1741-1784, the Holland Society of New York have placed a tablet in
recognition of his services during the American War of
Independence, a graceful and moving tribute to the valiant
dead.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Giethoorn and the neighbourhood are termed (like Amsterdam!)
Venices of the North. Needless to say that no part of the
Netherlands is like any part of Italy, and the use of the word
<i>Venezia</i> for local inns strikes a false note indeed.</p>

<p>The joy and fun of Giethoorn consisted in punting round the
cottages and farms, which are completely encircled by water and
reached each by a tiny drawbridge. It is also extremely pretty, in
the full sense of the word and, in a fairy-like fashion, simple,
rustic, and tranquil.</p>

<p>The rich trees, the gay flowers and gayer pots and globes in
each immaculate yard and garden, the punts manipulated with such
dexterity, passing up and down with varied loads, make of Giethoorn
in summer a vivid, luscious, and uncommon scene, so bright are the
colours, so fresh the foliage, so rich-hued the dark water. The
whole has an ingenuous, almost childish air which conceals the
fierce struggle with Nature which makes this loveliness, so
perilously snatched from the water, possible.</p>

<p>Here grow the most fragrant of wild flowers in profusion&mdash;thyme,
mint, valerian, lilies, and all manner of grass and rushes. There
is something particularly sweet and pleasant about water plants;
they never seem to fade, wilt or wither, turn brown or shrivel, but
are always erect, blooming, and glossy, bring thoughts of coolness
and repose, of shade and fragrance, and perhaps loneliness and
melancholy.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Giethoorn make mats of these rushes, and
collect the rich black peat for horticultural use. You can see them
at this work, quietly loading the punts or the barges with these
pleasant cargoes, or others, even more idyllic, of fruit or hay,
while the herons and the buzzards fly past and away into that low,
infinitely distant horizon, broken with those minute clusters of
trees, of tiny steeples that seem so ineffably far off, as if they
were in another world.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">
A FINE rain was falling in the camp at Bodegraven; the flats
were lost in mist; the farms, with the groups of fine tall trees
and roofed stacks, showed in vague outlines through the dripping
moisture.</p>

<p>The inundations caused by the opening of the sluice gates of the
Province of Holland had overspread all the lower ground; sodden
marshes and sheets of water covered farms, pleasure gardens,
country houses, villages. On the higher ground the desperate
inhabitants had gathered in makeshift dwellings. Now the rain was
swelling the flood which sucked at the very edge of the camp which
commanded Utrecht, Gouda, and The Hague, facing the lost Provinces
of Overijssel, Utrecht, and Guelders, occupied by the French. In a
few months the invading army had swept away a rich, fair portion of
the Low Countries, and no sensible man thought that there was any
hope for the other Provinces; King Louis was a great conqueror.</p>

<p>An old woman led a red cow up the bricked village street; a boy
followed with a load of vegetables, cabbages, hard and stiff,
purple and green, shining in the wet, and big, tightly bound
bundles of creamy-white onions. The rain was warm, but so steady,
with never a breath of wind. The cow went awkwardly over the brick
pavement, swinging her globular, clean sides. A girl came by with a
basket of laundry covered with a check cloth. She complained that
there was no drying of linen this weather, and the old woman
replied with a chuckle:</p>

<p>"It will serve to wash away the blood from the Plaats." For in
this month of September everyone was talking of the murder of the
MM. de Witt, and there was very little pity for them, for they were
looked on as the authors of the present ruin. This grim event was
now some days ago, but on every occasion the peasants spoke of it,
and generally they laughed, as they laughed when the corpses of the
French soldiers, caught by the floods, were washed up among the
alders and osiers, bruised against the windmill bases or caught in
the palisades that protected the camp.</p>

<p>The stout girl did not answer. She was thinking of all the
beautifully laundered officers' shirts, neck-clothes, and cravats
in her basket and worrying lest the damp should spoil the
starch.</p>

<p>Bodegraven was choked with refugees, people who had fallen back
with the retreating Dutch army from Utrecht, farmers, peasants, and
shopkeepers from Guelders and Overijssel. The gentry had been called
up with their companies of trained bands or had volunteered for
service, and this lesser sort was being carefully recruited. Two
engineers were going about among the crowded houses now, finding
the old men and boys who were yet strong enough to help throw up a
rampart round the camp to protect it from the rising waters.</p>

<p>The three peasants and the cow left the village and came towards
the camp. The dripping canvas of the tents was huddled round the
scattered farms, compact with stables and outhouses. It rained so
steadily; the very air seemed a palpable thing, it was so full of
moisture, and the floods and the sky seemed to melt into one
mist.</p>

<p>A man rode up from the lower levels, picking his way carefully
along the yet unsubmerged path bordered by the alders and coarse
grasses. He must have passed the sentries the peasants knew, so
they stepped aside quietly to allow him to proceed, only the old
woman said:</p>

<p>"This is an ill day."</p>

<p>And the dispatch rider:</p>

<p>"Ill enough."</p>

<p>He passed on and turned towards the little farm in the centre of
the camp where the flag of the United Provinces, with an orange
banderole, clung limp and damp to the staff.</p>

<p>The dispatch rider was a Frieslander. He brought letters from
Count John Maurice in Groningen, who commanded the Northern forces
of the Republic, to Prince William of Orange, Stadtholder of
Holland and West Friesland, and Commander-in-Chief of the armies of
Their High Mightinesses, the States-General, in this most perilous
moment.</p>

<p>A group of Blue Guards was outside the farmhouse. The
Frieslander spoke to an officer among them. The Prince was not
there, this man said, but would presently be back; he was out with
the engineers inspecting the dykes and waterways round Woerden.</p>

<p>"How useless it all is," said the Frieslander despondently. "The
Prince might as well go hunting on his German estates."</p>

<p>"You bring bad news, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, the Prince sent orders to Friesland and Groningen to open
the sluices there. And I bring word that they won't do that. And
Count John Maurice can't make them."</p>

<p>"A mutiny?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They won't destroy their own country. And I've heard, too,
of the murder of the MM. de Witt. That throws everything on the
Prince."</p>

<p>So steadily it rained. The two young men entered the farmhouse,
and the dispatch rider shook streams of water from his sodden
cloak. He was fair as an ear of wheat, big-boned, haggard, with
light eyes rather close set. He spoke with a weary frankness, as
one who laboured in a cause for which there was nothing to fear
because there was nothing to lose.</p>

<p>"Everything on the Prince," he repeated. "Some odium too, eh?
Did he go to The Hague?"</p>

<p>"Immediately. And dismissed the magistrates."</p>

<p>They were now in the farmhouse living-room. There was but one
other and that was the stable. All was clean and neat; the white
tiles with drawings in an old wine colour that lined the walls
shone, so did the noble collection of brass and copper pots,
despite the pervading damp. A small green-glazed stove was alight,
and there was a handful of fire on the open hearth, over which hung
a pot from a chain. Some broken red roses, half shattered by the
rain, beat against the narrow window-panes.</p>

<p>"Are these the Prince's quarters?" asked the Frieslander.</p>

<p>"Yes, save that he sleeps in a tent. You have not been here
before?"</p>

<p>"No. Count John Maurice sent me because he thought I could
explain to His Highness how hopeless it was to impose his wishes in
the North," replied the dispatch bearer rather haughtily.</p>

<p>"You have never seen the Prince?" asked the officer of the Blues
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"No. Of course he can do nothing. The country is lost and
ruined. My God, if he has had to abandon the Yssel, what is there
left to defend? And with people in this temper&mdash;Princes who can't
keep order are apt to be limbed themselves."</p>

<p>"His Highness has been threatened with such a fate," replied the
other. "But we keep our hearts high and our tongues silent,
Mynheer."</p>

<p>"Bah, with the French in Utrecht? Hasn't the time come for plain
speaking?"</p>

<p>"Well, speak plainly to His Highness, then; he never dislikes
that in a man."</p>

<p>"He will have to learn to tolerate it," replied the Frieslander.
"What is there before him but a pension from France or oblivion in
Germany?"</p>

<p>He spoke with the boldness of despair and with that candour that
men use when they are stripped of every resource. He was a great
lord in his own country, and knew little of the politics that had
hurtled the Seven Provinces into disaster, and little of the man
who had been set up to repair this disaster. In simple sincerity he
thought the task impossible and the man who had undertaken it
presumptuous and beaten already. With the invincible Frenchmen (and
England, mind you, behind them) gripping three provinces, and half
the rest of the country under water and in a state of anarchy, and
such an army, and such stores and such a fleet as twenty years'
pacifist policy had left available.</p>

<p>No one knew much of William of Orange at this time save that he
had been unfortunate always, orphaned and disinherited before his
birth, brought up as a prisoner of state, trained by John de Witt,
who had supplanted his family, as a severe Republican, and now, in
a moment of national despair and fury, restored to the sometime
honours of his house and since a few moments the idol of the
distracted people.</p>

<p>And he was nephew to one, and cousin to the other of the
besieging Kings who were publicly known to have made friendly
overtures to him, sparing no bribe nor persuasion nor threat to
detach him from the interests of the United Provinces.</p>

<p>All this was common talk. And the Frieslander, as he waited in
the neat kitchen, in his despair and melancholy, thought
gloomily:</p>

<p>"Probably he has already made his bargain with the French and is
but standing out for the highest price for the remaining towns.
What will he get? As a cadet of the House of Bourbon, as a Prince
of the blood royal of England, perhaps a Marshal's baton, perhaps
the hand of a French Princess&mdash;and my mission is a farce."</p>

<p>As the dispatch bearer waited, tired, disheartened, endeavouring
to dry his wet garments before the stove, he saw the old woman
drive the red cow into the stable, followed by the boy with the
basket of vegetables and the girl with the laundry.</p>

<p>They were accompanied by one of the Prince's gentlemen and a
valet who examined the cow and the vegetables and counted the
laundry. The Frieslander caught fragments of the whispered
conversation:</p>

<p>"His Highness was delicate in all his senses&mdash;he would have milk
from a red cow, a clean red cow, and vegetables that were firm and
fresh. The washing seemed very well, but who knew if His Highness
would be pleased? He was difficult with his linen."</p>

<p>And so on, with little interjections about the war, and the
floods, and the murder of MM. de Witt.</p>

<p>These trivialities, the outer silence, the encompassing rain,
the sweet, homely scene, made the gigantic ruin in which they were
all involved seem grotesque; the triumphant invaders, pressing to
the very verge of the floods that had saved the provinces of
Holland, seemed a monstrous, fantastic dream.</p>

<p>The outer door opened; a young officer entered. A little dog ran
before him and sat in front of the fire, shivering. The Frieslander
rose, wondering a little, his hard face set and tried, his clothes
steaming from the heat of the stove.</p>

<p>"You have dispatches from Groningen?" asked the new-comer.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mynheer." Then, as the other held out his gloved hand: "To
be delivered to His Highness the Stadtholder."</p>

<p>"Well," said the officer indifferently, "I am the
Stadtholder."</p>

<p>The dispatches were handed over, not without some confusion on
the part of the Frieslander, for this young man was not in the
least as he had imagined the Prince, but his mistake and his
embarrassment passed unheeded, for William leant against the
kitchen table and read his letters as if he had been alone. Though
piqued by this ignoring of his presence, the Frieslander was
pleased by this occasion to satisfy his curiosity.</p>

<p>The youth whose name had suddenly been covered with a fame that
was rather fantastic and rather terrible to sober men like the
Frieslander, stood but a few feet from the man who was observing
him so intently. He wore the uniform of the Blue Guards and
retained his hat.</p>

<p>He was then in his twenty-second year, but appeared older by
reason of his stately air of authority and his grave composure.
Slight and delicately made, his carriage was thoughtful, as if
every movement was considered and weighed, his features were
singularly noble, resolute, and serene, aquiline in outline, dark
and pale in complexion and shaded by long, rich heavy curls of a
dense brown touched with auburn, that hung far over his shoulders
and gave a marked character to his appearance. His eyes were
powerful, beautiful and uncommon. The Frieslander had noted at once
his direct and luminous glance, which was now bent on the
dispatches of his relative, Count John Maurice of Nassau.</p>

<p>The Frieslander thought how simple, how unheroic it all
was&mdash;this little scene that represented the utmost they could do in
the matter of a leader and his entourage; it was not from
headquarters like these that Louis and Turenne directed their
victorious campaign.</p>

<p>It was almost childish, almost insignificant and utterly
hopeless, a school lad playing a game. The dispatch-bearer wondered
that Count John Maurice, who was a veteran warrior of over seventy
and had ruled in high places, could defer the supreme command to
this youth.</p>

<p>The Prince finished his letter, and without even glancing at the
man who had brought it, he opened a little travelling desk that
stood on a press, and bending over it, still standing, began to
write a quick reply.</p>

<p>The Frieslander was half-amused at this, and said quietly:</p>

<p>"Count John Maurice, sir, wished me to speak with you on the
contents of that letter."</p>

<p>William paused, with the pen in his hand, and looking round,
asked, without interest:</p>

<p>"To what end?"</p>

<p>"I suppose, sir, to the end that you might understand the state
of the North&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand the state of the whole country," answered William
simply. "Count John Maurice is very well, but he is old, and when
one is old one loses heart."</p>

<p>"I think one need not be old, Highness, to lose heart now."</p>

<p>At this the Prince asked him, still indifferently, if he were of
the party of the MM. de Witt, and added:</p>

<p>"A pacifist may be a good man, but in time of war he shows in an
ill light&mdash;"</p>

<p>And continued his letter.</p>

<p>The Frieslander, walking up and down in front of the stove and
the open door that gave into the stable, was moved to speak of the
desperate position of matters, the atrocious peril of the moment
and the serious nature of the mutiny in Friesland, speaking
strongly of the things he had seen in his difficult journey from
Groningen and the state of affairs that had rendered possible the
vile murder of the MM. de Witt, so that the Prince, with this
clatter in his ears, was moved to desist from his letter and gaze
at him in a kind of astonishment. Then, while the Frieslander still
spoke, he turned away and finished and sealed his letter, so that
the Frieslander fell sullenly silent, feeling he had to deal with
one dull or obstinate beyond endurance.</p>

<p>William offered him the letter and told him to return to
Groningen with it at once.</p>

<p>"You look in no need of a rest; it is best that it goes at
once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then what I have said makes no impression on your
Highness?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that. Well, don't say it again&mdash;some people might take heed
of it."</p>

<p>The body-servant entered from the stable, closing the door
behind him. He presented the Prince with a pair of gloves that
William, smiling, showed to the Frieslander.</p>

<p>"They were given to me at Oxford two years ago, and they are
still very good&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he made this trivial remark he looked steadily at the
Frieslander for a second, then added instantly:</p>

<p>"Get back to Groningen and tell them <i>all goes well
here</i>."</p>

<p>"All goes well, Highness?"</p>

<p>"I trust you," replied the Prince simply, "to say that and to
believe it true."</p>

<p>The Frieslander picked up his still damp cloak from in front of
the stove. The servant was putting away the clean linen in a wall
cupboard. The Prince prepared to leave, closing his desk, pulling
the gloves over his hands of elegant delicacy. The scene somehow no
longer seemed so insignificant to the Frieslander, but rather as if
it might be the focus of great events.</p>

<p>"What shall I tell Count John Maurice, sir?" he said, as the
Stadtholder opened the door.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to say beyond what I have written&mdash;if the
officers refuse to obey they must be shot out of hand. I have sent
those orders. The sluices must be opened."</p>

<p>He looked again at the Frieslander, then left the farm and went
about his business, mounting among a group of men and riding away
with them into the rain and mist.</p>

<p>The Frieslander had no comment to make; he turned back with the
answer to Count John Maurice.</p>

critures qui en font assez mention."</i><br>
<br>
&mdash;Jean le Petit<br>
"Grande Chronique de Hollande et Zeelande."<br>
End of sixteenth century.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
THE Drenthe is an immense sandy heath that has almost defied
even Dutch industry. After the fertility of Groningen and Friesland
these wastes of moorland appear barren and desolate. Not that there
is any lack of farms, villages, and cultivated fields, but these
are all scattered about the endless flat moors and have a lonely
look. The farms are comparatively untidy, the dress of the people
comparatively poor and negligent, and the hard-won acres, with
difficulty rescued from the arid stretches of heath, do not bloom
with the luxuriance of the neighbouring Provinces.</p>

<p>The peasants, who have the reputation of being surly and
stubborn, wear, when they do wear the native dress, a more simple
and picturesque attire than that of the Frieslander, with no
ornaments of gold and silver and no coverings for their heads
beyond their thick, fair hair.</p>

<p>It is natural that they should be taciturn and churlish, for the
Drenthe offers opportunities for nothing save hard work and conveys
an effect of utter isolation.</p>

<p>The lack of trees, windmills, old towns, canals, and watercraft
gives a great part of Drenthe a monotony beyond that of any other
part of the Netherlands, nor are there any sparkling memories nor
great names associated with these miles of heath, or what there are
so long ago as to be now forgotten&mdash;the days of giants and fairies,
of primitive men, and of the Roman occupation; and what remains of
any of these but the sad, dusty objects gathered together behind
the glass cases in the museum at Assen? pitiful relics of a power
that has crumbled and civilisation that is dust.</p>

<p>Nor are there any of those charming towns which have been the
theatre for great events, nor sites of famous battles, or sieges or
splendid deeds. Assen, the capital, was created out of a village by
the Batavian Republic, at the end of the eighteenth century, and
Koevorden, the one-time capital, has sunk to a mere hamlet.</p>

<p>If this dark country, with its prehistoric monuments, contains
little to attract the traveller, it also possesses scant means of
transit. But one line of railway goes across it, and the neat brick
roads are here replaced by sandy tracks on which it is difficult to
walk or drive. Modernity is, no doubt, fast overcoming these
inconveniences and peculiarities, but enough of them remain to
prove correct the old travellers' tales that describe the Drenthe
as a ferocious and difficult country and the Drenthers as a
ferocious and difficult people.</p>

<p>The sterile plain is continually broken by regular mounds or
tumuli of prehistoric and unknown origin, and there are several of
the mysterious <i>Hunnebedden,</i> as sinister and ancient as
Stonehenge, and locally attributed to the rough hurtlings of
huge-handed giants.</p>

<p>At Borger there are eleven of these monuments, at Emmen nine, at
Adoorn eight, at Anloo seven. In all there are fifty-one of these
<i>Hunnebedden,</i> most of which belong to the Government or the
Province.</p>

<p>It does not stretch one's credulity to credit the presence of
giants in the Drenthe or that these primeval works were made by
their hands. The form is always the same&mdash;two long stones with one
across, covering urns full of ashes. Most of these have long since
been desecrated in the search for possible treasure, and in many
cases the stones have been pushed by the steady drive of up-growing
vegetation out of their position, so that they lie in shapeless
heaps. In some the original form remains, i.e., a block at either
end forms a chamber or gallery.</p>

<p>The stones are not shaped by hand, nor do they bear the merest
scratching of an inscription&mdash;like the dim period to which they
belong, they are inarticulate.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know where these stones came from
(there are certainly no quarries near, nor ever could have been)
and how far they were dragged for erection on the gloomy heaths.
"Glacier-borne boulders from Scandinavia," is the scientific
pronouncement, but this tells one little. There are said to have
been many more besides these remaining, and there are a great
number of similar erections in France, Sweden, North America, and
Africa.</p>

<p>The Middle Ages, naturally, accused evil spirits of fashioning
these uncouth temples and the Drenthers of worshipping therein. The
Council of Arles (452) and the Council of Tours (587) fulminated
against them as of infernal origin.</p>

<p>A certain Jean Picardt, one time a pastor in Koevorden,
published a book about the <i>Hunnebedden</i> in the year of our
Restoration, 1666, in which he describes and draws the gigantic
monsters whom he supposes to have built these rude, grand, and
nameless memorials.</p>

<p>These dark and huge phantoms seem fitting authors of these
desolate heaps of stones, and the pastor of Koevorden had good
excuse for his fantasy.</p>

<p>Modern research cannot clear up the matter much more
satisfactorily than the story-tellers. The most solid information
appears to be that which ascribes the <i>Hunnebedden</i> to the
efforts of the early Celts to celebrate some honoured leader&mdash;but
what labour, in those fierce times, to undertake for a mere chief,
and how many great men in a small tract of country!</p>

<p>Of course a great deal has been written about the
<i>Hunnebedden</i> (<i>Hun</i>, death, <i>bedden</i>, bed, tomb),
and those who will may wander in the mazes of wise men's
speculations.</p>

<p>And those who will not may be content with the giants as so
minutely described by the good Jean Picardt.</p>

<p>In either case it cannot be denied that, giants, evil spirits or
not, these massive heaps of stones cast a sinister gloom over a
country already sufficiently desolate.</p>

<p>Nothing is easier to imagine than some awful procession winding
across the sterile heath, beneath a leaden sky, bearing some
forlorn sacrifice to be immolated with unspeakable rites on the
dreary stones of the <i>Hunnebedden.</i></p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Assen is clean, spacious, open and comfortable, possessing a
fine park, in which Louis Napoleon intended to raise a
hunting-lodge, and the museum mentioned before, in which are
preserved all the relics found in peat-bed and sandy moor, "tumuli"
and <i>Hunnebedden.</i></p>

<p>This accumulation of the first vestiges of human life in the Low
Countries, of the Bronze Age and the Romans, is precious to the
archaeologist, but to the ordinary visitor it has but a dusty,
charnel-house flavour. Even the objects of beauty, such as the
Italian cameos and jewels, take on a melancholy, tarnished air so
close to these hideous flints, murderous, sacrificial knives, and
powdering, blackening bones.</p>

<p>There was a large nunnery at Assen, suppressed at the
independence of the Seven Provinces. The Provincial Office is on
the site. This reminds us of the curious Coat of arms of Assen&mdash;the
Virgin and Child&mdash;bespeaking the greater toleration of the times
when the Drenthe was made into a separate Province.</p>

<p>In the days of the States-General, when the divisions were
Zeeland, Holland, Utrecht, Groningen, Friesland, and Overijssel, the
Drenthe was part of Groningen, and belonged to the Friesland, and
there does not appear much reason for giving it a separate
identity. It was the scene of ceaseless internecine warfare among
local lords, being too far north and too desolate to attract much
attention from the various powers governing the Netherlands. When
agriculture was more primitive and less was known about the
development of unlikely land, the peasantry must have largely
subsisted on turf-cutting, which is still a considerable but not
very lucrative employment.</p>

<p>The Town Hall at Assen is part of an ancient church boasting the
remains of a thirteenth-century cloister; for the rest there is
nothing out of the way in this matter-of-fact, quiet little
provincial town, that does not seem to express either the spirit of
the Drenthers or the atmosphere of the Drenthe.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Neither does Koevorden, so much older and more, as it were,
indigenous, prove anything but a disappointment.</p>

<p>The ancient capital of the Drenthe has a modern Town Hall rind
an ugly church of 1641 with a humped back and a trifling spire, and
the streets are without character or interest.</p>

<p>There are, however, the usual handsome ramparts adorned with
lofty trees, showing the one-time importance of the town, which is
supposed to have originated in a Roman camp.</p>

<p>In 1024 Koevorden was the residence of the Counts of Drenthe,
fierce and arrogant potentates who kept a firm hand on their
undrained marshes and petty heaths.</p>

<p>Their overlord was, by virtue of a grant of the Emperor Henry
II, the Bishop of Utrecht, but his rights were ignored by the
Counts of Drenthe, and for hundreds of years the Bishops were too
harried by troubles nearer home to be able to enforce them, such
attempts as were made, as in 1288, when the Utrecht men crossed the
frozen marshes to attack Koevorden, being unsuccessful.</p>

<p>At the end of the fourteenth century, however, the rebel Count
of Drenthe was besieged by Bishop Frederic of Blankenheim, who,
after a struggle of six weeks, reduced his vassal to obedience.</p>

<p>In 1552, the town passed out of the power of the Bishops and was
occupied by the troops of Charles V. At the end of the War of
Independence it was fortified by Prince Maurice (1592), he
completing the ramparts which had been begun by the Spanish
commander, Everard Ens. Despite these defences, Koevorden, owing to
treachery, fell to the Bishop of Mnster in the <i>Ramp jaar</i>
(1672), but was soon retaken by Rapenhaupt, a success which
inspired Vondel with some punning verses.</p>

<p>Rapenhaupt followed the example of the old Bishop of Utrecht and
brought his troops up over the frozen marshes.</p>

<p>The town was soon after fortified by Coehoorn. These ramparts
were dismantled in the nineteenth century together with so many
others in the Low Countries. It is a pity that some at least of the
work of the great engineer could not have been preserved even when
it was useless; both patriotism and curiosity would have been
gratified by such an action.</p>

<p>Charming as the walks are on the bastions of these old towns, a
specimen of the elaborate and superb work of Coehoorn would have
been of supreme interest.</p>

<p>Outside Assen are these same bogs over which the Episcopal and
the States Armies once advanced, worth traversing now for the sake
of the pretty villages, like Dalen, Emmen, with the Celtic remains
and wooden bridges supposed to be Roman, and the drained marshes
and cleared bogs, another tribute to the energy and industry of the
Dutch.</p>

<p>Fine crops now flourish where noisome swamps once took heavy
toll of health and life, and new villages have risen where once
there was a dismal stretch of stagnant marsh. However, all these
parts of the Drenthe are still somewhat difficult of access, and
the traveller who wishes to study this peculiar country will have
to have patience and leisure and be able to defy fatigue.</p>

<p>Much of the Drenthe is even now sad, dark, and uncultivated,
despite all the efforts of engineers and farmers. Poisonous adders
abound round the lonely tumuli, and immense circular excavations,
attributed to witches escaped from hell, give an added sinister
touch to the dismal landscape.</p>

<p>The prosaic explanation of these queer pits is that they were
dug by ancient Celts shivering from the flaying north winds as some
possible protection from the bitter weather, or else were intended
for cisterns in which to gather the rain, these gloomy plains
having no other water.</p>

<p>A terrible country must the Drenthe have been in those days, and
one wonders why these Celts, instead of labouring in these dismal
regions to obtain water, shelter, build graves and altars, did not
wander further afield in search of more hospitable regions.</p>

<p>Some villages, such as Eext and Gieten, are placed in the midst
of a veritable "blasted heath" such as might have been relished by
the witches in <i>Macbeth.</i> At Borger and Gasselte it is little
better, nor do the prehistoric burying-places which abound enliven
the impressive desolation of this peaty desert.</p>

<p>The villages themselves are pleasant enough, and the green
fields from which the inhabitants wrest their living serve to
screen them from the bleak monotony of the plains.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Indeed these villages present another side of the Drenthe and
represent her most substantial claim to glory.</p>

<p>They have been painted by Wynants, by Ruysdael, by Hobbema, the
most poetic of the painters of the Netherlands, the last two of the
most poetic painters of the world.</p>

<p>Meindert Hobbema (born 1638) has been claimed by Antwerp and
Haarlem, among other towns, but the Drenthers maintain that he was
a native of Koevorden, and there seems no reason why they should
not be allowed this honour. Certain it is that he painted in the
Drenthe and that at Rolde, Eext, Gieten, Gasselte, and Borger you
may still see, concealed from the neighbouring wastes by clusters
of superb trees, the cottages with the low roofs, the sandy paths,
the dark undergrowths, the rich foliage, the mills, the fields that
Hobbema with such spontaneous simplicity so lovingly copied.</p>

<p>The more precise, mannered, and characteristic features of the
other Provinces, which other painters so skilfully turned to
account, did not appeal to Hobbema as did these humble solitudes,
and while they were engaged in depicting the joys of comfort and
prosperity, Hobbema was evolving poetic beauty from these lonely
and neglected villages of the Drenthe.</p>

<p>The fresh brightness of Hobbema's verdure, the dewy depth of his
skies, the tender radiance of the beams of light that penetrate his
floating clouds, and the sad darkness of his forests, his pure and
delicate colour, make these early essays in landscape painting some
of the most beautiful that art has yet attained.</p>

<p>The freedom that the Netherlands enjoyed at the end of the
sixteenth century at once affected pictorial art as well as every
other aspect of national activity. Religious painting came to an
abrupt end; Protestantism dispensed with the service of the Arts,
and the grandiose representation of Biblical and classic scenes for
Kings and Emperors also went out of date. The more modest patrons
of painting in the Netherlands asked for nothing more than their
own portrait, a civic banquet or city council or guild meeting, and
a very occasional allegorical picture celebrating some great
national event such as the Peace of Westphalia.</p>

<p>Hence we have, all at once, as it were, a bewildering richness
of genre pictures, landscapes, interiors and still life; all
subjects that, one feels, Dutch and Flemings had been always
longing to depict, as witness the exquisite backgrounds in the
early altar-pieces of this school, and the delicate care expended
on the detail of robes and a chance accessory, such as birds,
flowers, musical instruments or examples of goldsmiths' art.</p>

<p>There is something very lovely and refreshing in these first
expressions of a free art; you feel that these men were, for the
first time, perhaps, choosing their own subjects and executing them
in their own fashion, and this rustic life, these lowly scenes that
never before had been considered worthy of celebration, possess a
charm as fragrant as it is individual.</p>

<p>John Wynants (1600-1670), who was the teacher of so many
celebrated Dutch artists, came to the Drenthe to sketch the
negligent villages clustering without plan or order round the
flower-filled graveyard and the rustic church, the warm-hued
bricks, the immense roofs, the creamy plaster, the old red walls, a
medley of cottages and hovels without streets or any division but
the sandy paths leading to the heath.</p>

<p>Among his pupils were Adrian Vandervelde, the genre painter, and
Philip Wouverman (1620-1668), who also painted in the Drenthe, and
drew the figures and horses against the backgrounds of his
master.</p>

<p>This delicious painter lived in obscurity and neglect, and is
said to have died of chagrin at his failure and to have burnt all
his sketches and pictures that his sons might not be inspired by
them to follow a vocation that he had found so disastrous. His
younger brothers, Peter and John, were his pupils and imitators.
Other writers assert that Wouverman was rescued from his distresses
by a priest (he being a Romanist), and that he was in sufficiently
easy circumstances to be able to dower his daughter well.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to exaggerate the quiet and exquisite
charm of Philip Wouverman (whose glory belongs properly to Haarlem,
his native place), and however keen his disappointments, his life
cannot have been wholly unhappy, so exquisite a delight must he
have taken in his work and so industriously did he apply himself to
his art. There is not one of his numerous canvases that shows any
sign of haste or carelessness; the grace and spirit of the
composition are equalled only by the beauty of the finish.</p>

<p>His subjects are the subjects of every day&mdash;the farrier's shop,
the inn, the encampment, the hunt. Soldiers, cavaliers and horses,
all depicted with vivacity and truth, are usually the principal
figures in his designs. In the Drenthe you can still see these
smithies, these inn doors, these sandy wastes with stunted trees,
perhaps more untouched than in any other part of the country,
though Wouverman painted mainly in Holland and principally the
environs of Haarlem, then very different to what they are now.
These pictures are true history; they are like a diary written by
an artist, the notes of a loving spectator on the life of his
times.</p>

<p>In the diary of Constantin Hugyens, the younger, written a few
years after Wouverman's death, you may find scenes described in the
campaign of 1672 that read like pictures by this delicious
artist.</p>

<p>Wouverman left over eight hundred pictures, besides painting the
figures in the landscapes of other artists such as Wynants and
Ruysdael. In the Mauritshuis are some superb examples of this
artist: "The Arrival at the Inn" (No. 214), "The Departure from the
Inn" (No. 215), "The Falcon Party" (No. 216), "The Hay Cart" (No.
218), "A Great Battle" (No. 219)&mdash;the gem of the collection,
perhaps, "A Camp" (No. 220), and "Huntsmen Resting" (No. 221), and
"Huntsmen Halting" (No. 222).</p>

<p>These few pictures give an excellent idea of the range and power
of Wouverman's brush, and afford most valuable data for the student
of Dutch life in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Another painter, also belonging to Haarlem, may be mentioned
here, as he was inspired by the Drenthe before he went to paint the
sullen grandeur of the dark cascades of Norway.</p>

<p>This is Jacob van Ruysdael (1628-1682), also little appreciated
during his lifetime, when these representations of homely scenes
were ill-considered, but now held to be the greatest landscape
painter of the seventeenth century. His views, such as that of his
native town (Mauritshuis, No. 155), and that of the Vyverberg (No.
534, same collection), are historically of supreme interest, as
well as magnificent paintings, but his art rises to the greatest
heights in his lonely, rushing torrents, his dark woods, cloudy
skies and stormy seas, which are touched by the beauty of a poetry
both strong and fine.</p>

<p>His "Cornfield" (<i>Champ de Bl</i>) is known to have been
painted in the Drenthe.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>In the drenthe we miss the Stadhuis, which is an inevitable
feature of even small villages in the other Provinces. Here the
principal inn boasted a large, always comfortable and sometimes
elegant room which was reserved for the Municipal gatherings and
the transaction of local affairs. This custom is disappearing, but
has not yet gone, and even a few years ago travellers of
distinction were received by the innkeeper in these beautiful
council halls.</p>

<p>The villages of the Drenthe have always been celebrated for rye
bread and ham, delicacies by no means easily obtainable in every
Netherlands inn.</p>

<p>There are the remains of several grand castles in the Drenthe
more massive than the neat <i>slot</i> of the neighbouring
Provinces. That which belonged (and may do still) to the Counts of
Heiden Reinestein, Saarwoud, near Zuidlaren, is 'typical of the
others of which few exist in habitable condition. This building is
of eighteenth-century origin, but the estate and the magnificent
woods are very old.</p>

<p>There is a heronry in an avenue of majestic trees, and nothing
is more pleasing than to see the birds in spring flying to and from
their nests in the budding branches that trace so intricate a
pattern against the pellucid blue, against which the elegant birds
show with the vivid precision of a Japanese print.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>There is little more for the casual visitor to say of the
Drenthe, though there is enough interest in the curious Province to
serve for many a long study and many a flight of fantastic
speculation; the <i>genius loci</i> is strong enough here, though
his aspect is slightly sinister.</p>

<p>Those sympathetic towards this dreary landscape, these cheerful
hamlets, each an oasis in a desert of heath, these snatched morsels
of cultivated ground, these sandy paths and dark acres of peat,
these huddled farms, so pleasant in line and colour, these obscure
and awful burial-mounds and stones of a vanished nameless people,
might find an intolerable fascination in the Drenthe and be able to
evoke here many shapes of wonder and beauty.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
A HIGH wind was blowing across the desolate, dun plain. The
great tearing clouds and low sandhills seemed involved in one
stormy darkness; the tents fluttered against the strong poles; the
forked ends of the red-and-blue flag of the Republic beat out
vividly against the murk of the sky; the tents in the distance were
blurred with eddies of sand.</p>

<p>Beneath the flag a wreath and a can on a branch showed that here
wine was for sale, and a group of horsemen on heavy prancing
steeds, gleaming white and grey, had paused before the ragged door.
A richly dressed cavalier with a pennoned lance took the last glass
of wine from an officer on foot, for the trumpeter on the curveting
bay was sounding the blast for departure.</p>

<p>The soldier, kissing the buxom young wine-seller, made ready to
leap into the saddle; others controlled the kicking, leaping
horses, which seemed excited by the wind and the trumpet, and
prepared for the march. A beggar woman, crouched on the ground,
received in her outstretched hat the alms a lady riding pillion
behind a cavalier cast her; dogs hung round for the pickings of the
camp.</p>

<p>Three soldiers played at cards on a drum, and near them others
were sleeping on the hard ground, regardless of the chill wind and
the approaching storm.</p>

<p>The little troop continued their way across the sandy heath,
galloping quickly through the scattered encampment; the gay colours
of the pennon and tassel on the lance of the young nobleman who led
them dared the darkness of the gloomy day. Behind them, on the flat
Dutch country, the bright Dutch flags struggled with the northern
wind.</p>

<p>Drops of heavy rain began to fall; the scrub was bent flat by a
gale; the outline of a walled town loomed in dark gold on the
distant horizon.</p>

<p>The young officer further urged his gleaming steed. His plumes
and his curls flew out behind him under the radiant silk of his
pennon. He had dispatches for Prince Frederic Henry in his pocket.
He was glad that he would reach the town to deliver them before the
storm and the night caught up with his little troop.</p>

<p>The clouds broke behind the city and the sombre ramparts showed
grim against a streak of light. The Orange standard above the
citadel caught a ragged beam as it fought the wind against the
piled-up tempest clouds.</p>

<h3>GUELDERS</h3>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"High in valour,<br>
poor in wealth,<br>
Sword in hand,<br>
That is the motto of Gelderland."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
IN writing of Guelders as one of the Provinces of the
Netherlands, one is reminded forcibly of what a famous historian
has called getting "map bound," meaning that modern maps and
ancient history go ill together.</p>

<p>The old history of Guelders, i.e., the Duchy of Guelders and the
Countship of Zutphen, has as little to do with the story of the
United Provinces as have the stories of Juliers, Cleves, Mnster,
or the Palatinate; shifting frontiers, changing masters, endless
combats, and that vague over-lordship of the Empire make the
history of States like Guelders difficult indeed to write within
the arbitrary confines of a modern map.</p>

<p>The scenery of Guelders is different indeed from that of the
other Provinces. The flats of Holland and Zeeland, the moors and
marshes of Brabant and Overijssel, the low, rolling hills and
running streams of Limburg here give way to highlands clothed in
heather, rich woods, and the fertile plains watered by the Rhine
and the Yssel.</p>

<p>The people are as individual as their surroundings, handsome,
powerful, and tall; in the pure stock, the best type of Germanic
manhood. They look of the race of Siegfried, whose own town,
Xanten, is not so much further along the Rhine.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Guelders, though the frontier State
('tis but a step across a road and be in Germany), is not
essentially Dutch, but rather to say that to call Cleves, Mnster,
etc., German is but to use a name. These peoples were of the same
stock, and it is mere hazard that sends one under one flag, one
under another.</p>

<p>It would be a delightful task to write the history of Guelders
by itself, with due regard to these same neighbours of Cleves,
Mnster, Utrecht, Brabant, but with no obligation towards the
history of the United Provinces into which Guelders became
technically merged by the Union of Utrecht.</p>

<p>There are abundant materials for such a task, for the archives
of Guelders are particularly rich and well kept, and M. Nijhoff,
one-time keeper of these, has a monumental "Geschiedenis van
Guelderland," in which all the spadework is accomplished.</p>

<p>In the many glorious old castles, in the towns of Arnhem,
Nijmegen, Zalt Bommel, Gorkum, Elburg, Zutphen, in the villages of
the Betuwe and Veluwe, in the royal Palace of Het Loo, in such
princely residences as Middachten and Voorst, is a wealth of
material so overwhelming that to devote but a few pages to Guelders
seems an impertinence.</p>

<p>This material, though of absorbing interest, is largely local,
however, and Guelders, lovely and luxurious though it be, has not
that intense European significance, that immense individuality of
some of the other Provinces. These smiling glades and this rolling
campaign, these stately villas and mansions, one after the other,
lack the poignant charm, the unique atmosphere of the melancholy
flats, the dykes and the canals.</p>

<p>Dutch people tell you, with a certain ingenuous pride, that
Guelders is "different" from the rest of their country, that it is
like Scotland, and that it is a pity foreigners do not more often
visit such a delightful spot.</p>

<p>Of course Guelders is not like Scotland, any more than Amsterdam
is like Venice, or Edinburgh like Athens, or any other such
grotesque comparison. It is a most individual tract of land, very
stately, fertile, and given a dignified, almost haughty air by the
succession of the seats of the exclusive, reserved, old Dutch
aristocracy, and those of the opulent, cultured and conservative
merchant and professional classes, who, one after another, fill
town and country of upper Guelders with houses differing certainly
in size and importance, but all shining with a lustre of
prosperity.</p>

<p>In this part of Guelders the landscape has the same patrician
air as the houses; it seems a noble's park or a Prince's hunting
ground. The avenues, glades and alleys are such as we are familiar
with in the indigo and blackish-green landscapes on seventeenth-
and eighteenth-century tapestries, showing royal hunting parties
and elegant <i>ftes champtres.</i></p>

<p>The neat little map given in Professor Geyl's <i>Holland and
Belgium</i> does much to efface the impression made by modern
geography, and defines the real character of such frontier-disputed
areas as Guelders.</p>

<p>This map shows the Netherlands in 1550 and the then boundaries
of the Holy Roman Empire, which extended as far as the Scheldt, and
included Antwerp, Brussels, the whole of Hainault, and reached
Cambrai. Flanders and Artois, though fiefs of France, were held by
the Dukes of Burgundy, and therefore, in reality, united to the
other Provinces ruled nominally by the Emperor.</p>

<p>Here you see the Duchy of Guelders, one among many such duchies
and lordships, Cleves, Bentheim, Mnster, Limberg, Juliers,
Utrecht, Brabant, and so forth, and you get a clearer idea of the
position, status, and the likely internecine warfare of these small
states than is possible from any modern map. Remembering how
dubious and weak was the over-lordship of the Emperor, and how
powerful these Bishops, Counts, Dukes, and Earls became within
their own limits, one gains some conception of the endless
complications of the medieval policies of this portion of
Europe.</p>

<p>The cartographer has drawn a red line across his map from
Dunkirk to Olken in Juliers, showing that above this, Dutch, and
below, French, were the spoken languages at this period.</p>

<p>This line cuts just below Brussels, and includes most of the
country now known for the last hundred years as Belgium, before
that, as the Spanish or Austrian Netherlands, thereby proving how
arbitrary are the present frontiers, and how essentially these
people, with a common history, are one, and how natural should be a
solid union between them.</p>

<p>Here we are indeed in deep water&mdash;how far are the characters of
peoples determined and nationalities built up by governments,
religions, traditions?</p>

<p>The Netherlands were certainly one group or union of little
States till the Revolt against Spain, and until then it is indeed
difficult to disentangle the story of one from the story of
another; but the ten Provinces that remained Catholic and Spanish
appeared to develop soon a different character from the seven that
formed the United Provinces, and any attempt at their reunion has
so far proved disastrous. In the same way, Guelders, in joining
Holland, has become different from the other Germanic Duchies, such
as Juliers and Cleves, and is solidly enough part of the modern
Kingdom of the Netherlands.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The early history of Guelders is in the highest degree
picturesque and romantic. It seems to have been the cradle of much
Teutonic legend and tales of magic and chivalry&mdash;an atmosphere
wholly different from that of the other Provinces. No epic of
trade, adventures, discovery, no tale of great art or patient
intention comes from Guelders. Here were the nobles, the knights,
the soldiers, Germanic heroes of the Nibelungenlied and the early
ante-Christian days. The very name is said to have come from a
ferocious dragon, surely near kin to the one that guarded the
treasure which came to lie at the bottom of the Rhine, which flows
through Guelders, which devasted the land in the manner of such
beasts, bellowing the while: "Gelre! Gelre!"</p>

<p>Two noble brothers, Wichard and Luppold, dispatched the dragon,
to the accompaniment of a terrible tempest, and gave his ferocious
cry "Gelre!" as a name to the land over which they were gratefully
offered sovereignty.</p>

<p>And then there is the tale of Beatrix and Elius, placed in
Nijmegen, which is the tale of the Swan Knight, the German
Lohengrin, and Adela and Balderic and many another, until we come
to the early Counts of Guelders for long of the House of Nassau who
lived lustily and joyously, after the manners of their kind and
time, fighting continuously against their neighbours, mainly
against Utrecht and Brabant in these early times, the Lord of the
latter state building Bois-le-Duc (charmingly called "Boy'ld Duck"
by an ancient English traveller) to withstand them.</p>

<p>Utrecht and Guelders fought savagely over the Veluwe, Bishop and
Duke giving each as good as he got, and devastating between them
the prize for which they strove. Reinald I, Count of Guelders, was
a friend of Adolf of Nassau, that Emperor whose knightly figure
shows still above his lovely house in Nuremberg, and whose statue
rises again so magnificently on the wooded banks of the Lahn in his
native Province of Nassau; who never had any money in his purse,
but always his sword by his side.</p>

<p>The following glimpse of this Nassau brings before one these
spirited and violent days.</p>

<p>Adolf, friend as well as ally of Reinald, was, in one of his
many battles, captured and brought before his enemy, the Duke of
Brabant, after having valiantly defended himself against five
Brabant knights.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the Duke of his dishevelled prisoner.</p>

<p>"I am the Count of Nassau. And who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am the Duke of Brabant, five of whose finest knights you have
just overcome."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for that&mdash;it was for you I had my sword sharpened,
and through the whole battle have I looked for you. Had I found
you, you would have shared the fate of your knights."</p>

<p>For this bold answer the Duke gave him his freedom without
ransom.</p>

<p>Reinald II was the first Duke of Guelders, and in 1331 he sent
three Guelders' nobles, Otto van Kuyk, Ricold van Heeswijk and
Jacob van Mierlaer, to England, to demand the hand of Eleanor,
sister of Edward III. The English King gave his sister ten thousand
pounds sterling as dowry, and her husband settled on her, out of
the revenues of the Beluwe, fourteen thousand pounds Flemish (or
gulden) for her pin money.</p>

<p>With gorgeous pomp the marriage was celebrated at Nijmegen, and
the bride's residence was afterwards at Roosendaal (Valley of
Roses), which the young princess must have found sweetly named.</p>

<p>This daughter of the murdered Edward and the wanton Isabella
seems to have been one of those gentle, pious, noble women, those
veritable "doves in the eagle's nest" who bloomed in the fierce
households of the Middle Ages. She is said to have foretold to her
warlike husband the extinction of his line, and with the burial of
her two sons, Reinald and Edward, beside their forefathers in the
Cloister of Gravendaal in 1371, her prophecy was fulfilled. The
Dukedom of Guelders passed to the house of Juliers, as the
Countship of Holland passed to the house of Hainault.</p>

<p>On the death of Reinald IV, childless, in 1418, the line of
Juliers came to an end, and Guelders passed to the son of his
niece, Maria van Arkel, Arnald of Egmont, who was miserably deposed
and brutally treated by his son, Adolf, like Reinald III, who was
walled up in the thick walls of Roosendaal, where a mere ray of
light penetrated, for ten years by a brother desirous of his
honours.</p>

<p>Charles of Egmont, third of his house, and the most interesting
personality among the Lords of Guelders, was the last of his family
and of the independent rulers of Guelders.</p>

<p>There was an attempt, in 1672, to revive the Dukedom of Guelders
by offering it to William of Orange in gratitude for deliverance
from the French, but the stern Republicanism of the other Provinces
caused William III prudently to decline the graceful compliment.
One of the most charming of Romeyn de Hooge's elegant plates shows
the young Captain refusing the ancient Dukedom, which, hundreds of
years before, had belonged to his ancestors of Nassau.</p>

<p>From the Union of Utrecht the romantic, warlike, and lovely
Duchy joined her more grim, sober, and businesslike neighbours,
among whom she took premier place; but she still seems, to a
stranger's eyes at least, the spoiled child of that illustrious
confederation, and to have preserved her own character, which is
hardly that of the stern, Republican, Calvinist Netherlands.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Schenck, the key between Holland and Germany, Grone, the theatre
of the terrible siege of 1672, Tolhuys, the scene of the
much-vaunted passage of the Rhine in the same year, which, however,
Napoleon described as "a fourth-rate military exploit," the very
ancient towns of Doesburg and Doetinchem, the intensely interesting
fortified harbour of Elburg on the shores of the Zuyder Zee,
Oldenzaal, with St. Plechem and the Hunnebedden and Almelo, the
villages in the Betuwe, all deserve, as the saying goes, "a book to
themselves." Guelders is indeed full of fascinating and
inexhaustible interest, and a few brief notes can do no more than
indicate some of the principal beauties, first among which come the
castles, which are not quite like any other castles anywhere
else.</p>

<p>Roosendaal has pride of place here. It is the most enchanting
example of an old battlemented castle turned into a noble's country
seat, and is a piquant medley of massive strength and fastidious
elegance, rising from a spacious moat in the midst of a noble park,
where baroque bridges, grottoes, cascades, and statues combine
charmingly with the old avenues and glades, the massive beech trees
and the wooded heights that form the background of Roosendaal.</p>

<p>From one side the Castle still presents a completely medieval
appearance and has the air of lonely grandeur, of rather remote
splendour associated with what once has been and is no more. At one
time a residence of the Counts and Dukes of Guelderland, Roosendaal
has the attraction of having been long in the possession of one
noble family, who have spared nothing in embellishing their
splendid residence.</p>

<p>Eleanor, Duchess of Guelders, was not the only English Princess
to live at Roosendaal; here often visited Mary Stewart, afterwards
Queen of England, and a needlework screen, some pious meditations
in holograph and a bizarre rococo summer-house are still preserved
as memorials of the gentle and rather pathetic wife of William III.
This monarch was also a frequent visitor to Roosendaal, as indeed
he was to most of these aristocratic Guelders chteaux.</p>

<p>Biljoen, considered the most ancient Castle in the Province,
though rebuilt about eight hundred years ago, was largely
dismantled and spoiled on being sold to a stranger about half a
century ago, but still has a massive and grandiose effect.
Sonsbeek, of the family of the Haeckerens, which name recalls one
of the fiercest feuds in Guelders, is a delicious, formal mansion
with opulent gardens and a Belvedere from which one can see over
the Germanic plains to where the city of Cleves lies like an ornate
crown. Voorst is the gorgeous little baroque Castle presented by
William III to Arnold von Keppel, Earl of Albermarle. Among others
are Cannenberg and Oldenwaller and Doorwerth, now a most admirable
military museum; but indeed the castles and chteaux of Guelders,
especially in that favourite part so adapted to the stately hunts
of former days, called absurdly enough "Dutch Switzerland," are of
the most attractive charm, variety, and interest, and give a unique
air of patrician opulence to this corner of the Province.</p>

<p>One that is typical of all, yet that excels all, is Middachten,
built on a Roman foundation. It was destroyed by the Spaniards,
1625, and rebuilt by the son of Anna van Middachten, Renier van
Raesfelt, in 1640. Thirty years later it was again rebuilt by
Godard van Reede from designs by Vinckhoorncool, possibly the
architect of the massive Stadhuis of Enkhuizen.</p>

<p>At the end of the nineteenth century Middachten, through the
marriage of Jacoba van Reede with Count John Bentinck, came into
the possession of the present princely owners, whose family is so
honourably connected with the story both of England and the
Netherlands.</p>

<p>The above Godard van Reede de Ginkle was the first Earl of
Athlone, 1630-1703, William III's general and friend,
Commander-in-Chief in Ireland in 1690-1692, whose skill, judgment,
humanity, and honour were admitted even by his enemies, but who
appears to be too little valued by posterity.</p>

<p>Not only was he a bold and vigorous soldier, a sagacious and
prompt commander, but he added to these high qualities generosity,
patience, and moderation, and a winning personality. One thinks
more would have been heard in English history of this great and
honourable soldier had he chanced to be English instead of
Dutch.</p>

<p>Above the dark-brick front of Middachten can be seen the arms of
Van Reede and Raesfelt. Black-bodied griffons support the circular
shield, above which is a coronet and below the motto <i>Maloimor
quam foedari.</i></p>

<p>The whole effect of Middachten is so exactly that of period, of
country, of an atmosphere; it is so completely what it might be, as
it were, so perfect within the limits of its own possibilities,
that few, even among more pretentious or beautiful old houses or
palaces, could be more satisfying.</p>

<p>It has the most beautiful approach possible, the immense avenue
of limes, the <i>Middachten Alle,</i> which is one of the most
wonderful in the world&mdash;miles of straight gigantic trees whose
branches, woven together overhead, conceal the sky and provide a
delicious green shade on the most glaring day.</p>

<p>Middachten evokes a thousand memories of the past, of the
stately formalism, the rich restraint, the ornate, artificial,
dignified taste of the seventeenth century. The prim chateau rises
sheer from the moat and is approached by the most modest of
bridges. The gardens contain all you are sure they must
contain&mdash;orangery, <i>Zonnewijzer, Jardins de broderies,</i> glades
of exquisite grass, beds of exotic flowers, a wall curiously topped
by an ivy edge, every ingenious device of the formal garden, all
severe yet opulent, quiet but luxurious, the very flavour of the
seventeenth century, subtly pervaded with that melancholy which
savours of all that is yesterday, all that lives more in the memory
than in reality.</p>

<p>The completion to the almost poignant fascination of Middachten
is given by the blue and white flag that flies above the chateau
when the noble owner is in residence.</p>

<p>The interior is, of its style, superb, and contains more than
the usual amount of curious and historic treasures.</p>

<p>To see Middachten is to have a momentary but perfect illusion of
returning to the beloved past, so endearing and so sweetly
melancholy.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Arnhem, to those who know something of her history, must at
first sight be a complete surprise. This gracious and lovely city,
so extremely pleasant and charming, bears no traces of her
vicissitudes, save in her ancient church and her ancient
<i>Gemeente huis.</i> No memorials here of sieges, battles, revolts
or such tempestuous episodes. The old town has completely
disappeared, and there have taken its place wide streets, elegant
gardens, commodious dwellings, the oldest of which have no medieval
flavour, but indeed rather a Jane Austen Sunday afternoon air of
refined ease and comfort.</p>

<p>Arnhem, which, despite its modernity, is very attractive, is
delightfully situated on the Lower Rhine and surrounded by the most
tempting of suburbs, such as Sonsbreek, Reeberg, and Velp, and in
spring and summer seems literally wreathed in flowers and embowered
in trees, so prodigally bestowed are gardens, public and private,
and groups, avenues and bouquets of the most graceful trees.</p>

<p>The town has no provincial air, but seems rather a miniature
capital of some tiny kingdom, and the Rhine gives it both romance
and dignity.</p>

<p>And after having said so much, there is little more to be said
about Arnhem, which indeed does not solicit the stranger's
admiration.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Arnhem, owing to the modern and nondescript style of the
handsome houses, has no special Dutch character, and even the
church is not of the usual Netherlandish flavour, for the interior
has not been whitewashed, but left in the original soft grey stone,
or else the plaster has been recently removed.</p>

<p>This church (St. Eusebius) is very splendid and large, built in
pure, though late Gothic (1425). The brick exterior is ornamented
with sandstone, which, like that used in the Cathedral at
Bois-le-Duc, has miserably crumbled. The tower is majestically high
and contains a chime of bells of 1650.</p>

<p>There is the usual gorgeous organ, the usual gorgeous pulpit,
and a curious gloomy mural tablet to Josse Sasbout (died 1546),
Chancellor of Charles V in Guelders. This graceful work is by one
Colyn de Nole, and skilfully interprets the dismal philosophy of
the time, <i>De Dood makt groot en klein,</i> etc.</p>

<p>The church contains, besides this, one magnificent tomb which is
the most important memorial of the past in Arnhem, and to some the
most interesting object in the festive little town.</p>

<p>This is the tomb of Charles of Egmont, last Duke of Guelders,
which has been recently restored. It stands in the centre of the
choir, where it looks drearily out of place, as such monuments do
in Calvinistic churches, but is itself of rich beauty and endless
fascination to those who know something of the man it
commemorates.</p>

<p>All is in the grand style, lofty, ornate, eloquent. On the
pedestal of black marble the Duke in white marble rests at full
length, his hands clasped, bareheaded, but for the rest fully
armed. The figure is of the most expressive dignity; the smooth,
aesthetic, refined and charming face appears as if taken directly
from the life. The recumbent knight is surrounded by six small
lions, who each holds one of his lordship's arms on a shield, these
being in the most admirable proportion and fitting harmoniously
into the general design, in a manner that heraldic blazons do not
always achieve.</p>

<p>Round the pedestal are bas-reliefs, in white marble, sixteen
alabaster Apostles and Evangelists executed in a flowing,
grandiose, and rich manner. This combination of black and white
gives a sombre, funereal effect in fine keeping with the melancholy
of a tomb. These reliefs are by Gerard Lummen van Venlo.</p>

<p>The details of the Duke's harness, the helmet by his side, are
worked with exquisite skill, and the whole monument, which is,
since the restoration in 1913, beautifully kept, is one of the most
superb and complete of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Of even more peculiar and, as it were, personal interest, is the
life-size figure of the Duke kneeling under a canopy attached to a
pillar about twenty feet from the ground and wearing the armour
that Charles of Guelders wore in life.</p>

<p>This figure is known to have been in this position from 1636,
the date of the frame or canopy, and the singularity of the
position has been a cause of comment to many visitors and evoked a
curiosity not to be satisfied locally, where indeed no interest is
displayed in either the Duke or his image.</p>

<p>The explanation, however, would appear to be simple. It was
customary in the Middle Ages to hang a knight's armour above his
tomb, as a trophy or offering, as the Black Prince's armour is
still in Canterbury Cathedral, and many an odd sword or basinet is
still to be found in old churches. In the case of illustrious
personages, this armour would be placed on a figure as like the
deceased as possible and set, in an attitude of devotion, near the
tomb, in some niche specially prepared.</p>

<p>Such a figure, in full armour, is placed above the gorgeous
grave of the Archduke Ferdinand of the Tyrol, in the Innsbruck
Palace Chapel.</p>

<p>The effect of this image, so life-like and so strangely
surviving the centuries, is vivid to the verge of unpleasantness.
It has the horror of the waxwork, the pathos of the mummy.</p>

<p>The likeness of the aristocratic face to that of the figure on
the tomb is strong, and between the two, the armed image and the
statue, one receives an instant, keen impression of the personality
of this slight, slim, fair man of the type of Donatello's St.
George.</p>

<p>We are far from the brocaded air of Middachten, the mannered
elegance of the Middachten Allee, in the gay cafes, the <i>Musis
Sacrum,</i> the pleasant promenades, the bright, formal gardens,
the clean and spacious houses with flowers in the windows of modern
Arnhem.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Charles of Egmont, last Duke of Guelders, was descended from
some of those illustrious families whose very names evoke
glittering images of pomp and power. Their arms are upheld by the
lions round his tomb&mdash;Guelders and Juliers, Cleves and Mark, Arkel
and Burgundy, Berry, Bavaria, and Hainault.</p>

<p>Born in 1467, in the darkest hour of his father's misfortunes,
Charles was captured in 1473 at Nijmegen by a conqueror of
Guelders, the redoubtable and gloomy Duke of Burgundy, called
Charles the Bold or Headstrong, and taken with his sister Philippa
to Ghent to be educated. There he was placed under the care of the
meek and amiable heiress to all the turbulent conquests of the
House of Burgundy, Mary, married in 1474 to the "last of the
knights," the Archduke Maximilian, son of the Emperor Frederic.</p>

<p>Charles of Burgundy went down to death in the sombre disaster of
Nancy three years later, and Mary, whose husband ruled her
Netherlandish possessions, continued to protect the deposed
orphans; but in a short time the gentle Duchess was killed by a
fall from her horse, leaving her ambitious husband free to marry
another woman with a dowry as splendid and as troublesome.</p>

<p>It is said that Mary, on her deathbed, begged her husband to
allow her wards to return in freedom to Guelders; but Maximilian
had already an idea of the quality of Charles, and kept him close.
His sister evaded Maximilian by her marriage with Rene, Duke of
Lorraine.</p>

<p>Charles, however, escaped and put himself under the protection
of Engelbert of Nassau. By 1492 he had succeeded in rousing
Guelders, always ripe for revolt against the alien Burgundian rule,
and was proclaimed Duke. He was now twenty-five years old,
beautiful, elegant and accomplished, full of courage and eager
hopes.</p>

<p>Maximilian's attempts to regain Guelders resulted in a war which
lasted till 1499, when, by the intervention of Louis XII, a truce
was proclaimed.</p>

<p>Philip the Handsome, Maximilian's son, carried on a further war
for the lost Province, during which Charles made himself master of
Brabant. Maximilian now formed a league against the bold Duke,
including the Kings of Aragon and England, and Charles was
compelled to do homage to Maximilian, an episode magnificently
rendered on one of the bas-reliefs on Maximilian's cenotaph at
Innsbruck, where the exquisitely aristocratic and knightly figure
of the proud Austrian, and the forced submission of the equally
haughty Egmont are rendered with superb taste and feeling.</p>

<p>Round this empty tomb, so far from Arnhem, watch the monstrous
bronze figures, in grotesque armour, of Charles' loathed enemies,
the Burgundian conquerors, Philip the Good, Charles the Bold,
Philip the Handsome.</p>

<p>The Duke of Guelders, however, was by no means daunted. With the
aid of the French he renewed the conflict and successfully resisted
till 1528, when Maximilian's son and successor, Charles V,
compelled him to accept the position of a vassal of the Empire.</p>

<p>Charles now schemed to detach Guelders from the Empire and unite
her to France, not such an impossible chimera as a glance at the
modern map might seem to prove, but his subjects so resented the
scheme that they forced him to abdicate in 1538, leaving his
honours to William, Duke of Cleves, Juliers and Berg, a faithful
vassal of the Emperor.</p>

<p>That year Charles of Egmont, having lost in his old age the
beloved land for which he had fought so fiercely, winning, losing,
winning, losing, for half a century, died of chagrin, and was given
those honours in death which he had just resigned in life.</p>

<p>Such are the bare bones of a tale as vigorous, glowing and
picturesque as any to be found in the annals of those times, when
men did not fight for a cause, or a faith, or any question of any
policy, but simply for a crown, towns, so many miles of land; so
many armed men to ride behind them, so many castles in which to
take their ease.</p>

<p>And now the flowing away of silent time has left Charles of
Egmont stranded in the cool shadows of a Calvinist church with an
alien city stretching beyond the doors, his florid pomp showing
queerly in the sullen simplicity of the bare aisles, his kneeling
image supplicating the empty air from which his idols have long
since vanished.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The only other old buildings of any importance in Arnhem are the
<i>Gemeente huis,</i> completely restored and modernised, and St.
Walpurgis (a name so suggestive of fiendish and unearthly
gathering), which still belongs to the Roman Catholics and
therefore preserves much of its original character, although this,
the oldest church in Arnhem, was from 1583 to 1806 an arsenal and
housed the thunders of earth instead of those of Heaven.</p>

<p>Louis Bonaparte, a just, moderate man, most anxious to do his
best, returned the town powder magazine to its original use, and
St. Walpurgis, very well restored, is now gorgeous with coloured
glass and painting and gilding.</p>

<p>The other building has a deeper interest. The <i>Gemeente
huis</i> was once the <i>Duivelsch huis van Marten van Rossem,</i>
the famous lieutenant of Charles of Egmont, called "Devil's House,"
either from the ferocious-looking gargoyles which adorn it, or, as
seems more likely, since so many edifices of that time had such
ornaments, from the disposition of the master.</p>

<p>Van Rossem was a true soldier of the times when rapine, pillage,
massacre, burning, and slaying were part of everyday military life,
and appears to have been a terror to his enemies and no great
comfort to his friends. He owned Cannenberg Castle, first built in
1372, and there his statue may be seen with a Dutch inscription
giving his titles: <i>Heer tot Poederogen ende
Meyneswyck</i>&mdash;<i>Marschalk van Gelderland,</i> and so on. A
portrait of the grim "Marschalk" and one of his master, Duke
Charles of Egmont, may be seen with other corporation treasures and
seals in the town museum of Arnhem.</p>

<p>The <i>Duivels huis</i> has been carefully restored to, as far
as possible, its ancient form, and now serves the decorous office
of Town Hall or portion of the Town Hall, which end of his
favourite residence would not have been much to the taste of Marten
van Rossem, one of whose favourite sayings was:</p>

<p>"As the <i>Magnificat</i> is the jewel of the Vespers, so is
carnage the jewel of the campaign."</p>

<p>This fire-eating and breathing warrior lived without fear and
died without repentance, for he came to his end in Antwerp, through
his favourite vice of gluttony. His death was as hearty as his
life, for the lusty "Marschalk" choked while ravenously devouring a
pigeon pie, or expired from a fit at this moment; in any case, this
was the consistent, if undignified finish to his dreadful career,
and had at least the merit of candour and a certain vigorous,
virile simplicity&mdash;a <i>condottiere</i> of the North.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The <i>Sabel Poort</i> is the one remnant of the walls or gates
of Arnhem left; it has been much restored.</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the most valuable collection of
Provincial and Municipal archives, charters, account, and fief
books, etc., the oldest of which is dated 1076, and with which is
incorporated the library from the old Abbey of Bethlehem, mostly
charters still with their seals, of local and expert interest only,
but extremely beautiful objects to the sight and touch.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Outside Arnhem is a queer "Open-Air" Museum, where, in a
picturesque park, are gathered examples of Dutch domestic peasant
architecture, mostly wood, taken from all the Provinces of the
Netherlands.</p>

<p>These huts, windmills, waggons, farms, and so on, that look
inevitably like an ogre's toys, are prettily arranged, and of the
utmost interest to those attracted by this humble architecture,
often so neat and pleasing, and always so suitable to its purpose.
This Museum preserves admirably what would otherwise be completely
lost, and the idea might, before it is quite too late, be copied in
other countries; there is an excellent collection of this kind
outside Stockholm.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>A different type of collection is housed in the stately Castle
of Doorwerth on the road to Oosterbeek, where there is now the
Guelders Historical Museum and that of the Dutch Artillery.</p>

<p>Doorwerth is one of the most impressive of the numberless
castles of the Low Countries. It was built in 1260 by Barend van
Doorwerth, and in 1493 was one of the strongholds of Charles of
Egmont. Afterwards it was in the possession of the Bentinck family.
Three Dutch Stadtholders, Frederic Henry, William II, William III,
visited here, as did the King of Denmark in 1705.</p>

<p>Doorwerth is more like a German than a Dutch castle, and has
something of the romantic, fantastic air of its fellows farther up
the Rhine. It is placed on a gentle rise above the river and
commands a view of the utmost grace and delicacy; the Rhine winding
from Prussia down to Rotterdam, the soft woods and airy distances
(those azure perspectives beloved by Claude Lorraine), the Betuwe,
so fertile and radiant, and Elst, Elden, Tiel, and Nijmegen visible
along the shining length of the famous river which surely washes
the stones of more fair cities than any other river in the
world.</p>

<p>Guelders was always divided into the Betuwe, or rich, pasture
and wooded land, and the Veluwe, or barren, sandy, heathy land. In
springtime the bloom and blossom in the Betuwe is of a loveliness
sufficient to draw strangers to gaze on the fairy white and rose of
cherry, apple, plum, and pear.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Very few foreigners ever penetrated to Guelders in the past;
these further Provinces were regarded by French and English as
almost savage places, nor was there much trading done with the
warlike Duchy, so foreign influence, anecdote, tale, or memorial is
not found here. Nor, on the other hand, did Guelders produce any
great men of her own, at least in the arts and sciences. <i>Arnhem
der Lustige</i> seems destitute of native talent, and the men of
Guelders had too often "the sword in hand" to be able to wield
anything more peaceful.</p>

<p>Mary of Guelders, however, married James II of Scotland, and the
red-haired angel in the valuable altar-piece at Holy-rood Palace is
pleasingly supposed to be her likeness. One hopes that this
precious painting, still of disputed authorship, but obviously
Netherlandish work, does contain the likeness of the Dutch Queen of
Scotland.</p>

<p>James II was killed by the bursting of a cannon ball at the
siege of Roxburgh, and Mary built for her consolation and retreat a
little chapel outside Edinburgh, where perhaps she sat and played
the "angelic music" of the fifteenth century and looked very much
like the Dutch angel in the altar-piece so miserably mis-hung in
Holyrood. Mary of Guelders' chapel and the lake it stood by were
both destroyed by the building of Waverley station and the
railway.</p>

<p>This is one of the few faint links that connect Guelders with
the rest of Europe. For the rest, the lovely Province, until it
became the favourite hunting ground of William III, had little to
do with the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>Perversely, perhaps, the figure of Charles, Count Egmont, Duke
of Guelders, seems to remain the most vital thing in Arnhem and the
surrounding campaign. One hears his war-cry "Gelre! Gelre!" sees
the red and yellow colours floating above the slim, knightly
figure, the resolute blond face clearly enough in every glade of
Guelders. The man was the most important his country produced, and
his story would be well worth telling.</p>

<p>This family afterwards produced another gallant and unfortunate
knight, Count Lamoral Egmont, who was one of Alva's first two
victims, and Anna van Buren, through whom the possessions of the
Egmonts came into ownership of the House of Orange.</p>

<p>Though Charles of Egmont sleeps alone in Anthem choir, and the
guide assures you he was unmarried, he wedded in 1518, when he was
already fifty years old, Elizabeth, daughter of the Duke of
Brunswick Luneberg, by whom he had no children.</p>

<p>His appearance, shortly after his marriage, when he was at one
of the most anxious moments of his fortune, is thus described, and
with this picture of Guelders' greatest son, we may leave
Arnhem.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Charles of Egmont was at Roosendahal, whose fourteen-feet-thick
walls offered stoutprotection against any possible attack. His
stables were full of stately horses, and he had with him his
menagerie of lions and other odd Eastern beasts, but for his own
splendour there was little money. When at war, Charles, with the
armour now seen above his tomb, displayed a helmet with a huge
panache of peacock's plumes, like the Teutonic Knights, three tiers
of stiff feathers, surely the most pompous decoration that ever
crowned mortal brows. In Roosendaal he wore a red cloth hat where
seven gold roses held a sweep of ostrich feathers. Each rose
sparkled with a jewel in the heart. Beneath this Charles wore a
close gold-embroidered cap, for, after the mode of the Burgundian
Court, then the most elegant in Europe, the Duke had his hair
close-cropped and his face close-shaved, an effect very noticeable
in the statue on his monument and the image that wears his
armour&mdash;indeed, in all early Netherlandish portraits; Maximilian I
and his son, Philip the Handsome, wore long, heavy, square-cut
hair, a German fashion.</p>

<p>The rest of the Duke's attire was red velvet jerkin and
breeches, a beautiful grey wolfskin fastened with a jewelled clasp
over his shoulders, and several gorgeous rings, which served
another purpose besides adornment, for the emerald was a charm
against fever, the opal protected him from poison, the sapphire
warded off complaints of the eyes, and a topaz served to strengthen
his memory, for the dauntless Egmont was not without his beliefs in
talismans, as indeed who has been? it is an arid character that is
without some superstition.</p>

<p>Duke Charles was one of the most industrious and careful of
sovereigns; hardly a town or village in Guelders is without some
memorial of his loving care for the little State for which he
struggled so valiantly and so vainly.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>At Apeldoorn, that grand and luxurious village which is old
enough to be mentioned in the letters of such shadowy Emperors as
Otto III and Lothair III, is situated one of the most celebrated
Palaces of Europe, Het Loo, which is, as it were, the very crown of
this country of palaces and castles and noble mansions.</p>

<p>Originally a <i>jachtslot</i> of no great pretension, it was
bought by William III, Prince of Orange, from one Van Dornick, who
had another hunting seat in Guelders, at Dieren. The Stadtholder
had a particular affection for Het Loo, probably on account of the
lovely scenery and the vicinity of the residences of his
friends.</p>

<p>Het Loo had been destroyed by the Spaniards and was again
ravaged by the French in 1672; but on the site William III built
the present formal chateau designed by Jacob Roman and decorated by
Daniel Marot. One can see the same taste in Het Loo as in
Kensington Palace and Hampton Court and Oranjestein, in Diez,
Nassau&mdash;the attractive combination of austerity and richness, bare
faades, hard angles, plain lines, pseudo-classic Palladian, and
within, rococo and lavish, florid ornament.</p>

<p>But Het Loo is by far the most imposing of any of these palaces;
William III continued to embellish it to the end of his life. It
was his absences here which caused so much jealousy in England. At
his death, when his disputed possessions were divided between the
King of Prussia and Prince William Friso, Het Loo came to the share
of the Dutch Prince. In 1796 Het Loo was seized by the French, the
contents sold, and it was converted into barracks.</p>

<p>Two of the elephants from the menagerie were sent to Paris. It
must have been no easy journey in those days.</p>

<p>King Louis Bonaparte, who seems to have always acted with
admirable intent, endeavoured to have the Castle restored as a
royal residence; but his reign was too short to allow him to carry
any of his ideas into effect.</p>

<p>On their return to power, the Princes of Orange recovered their
property, and it was here that William I, King of the Netherlands,
abdicated his crown in his old age, in 1840, to William II, the
dashing, handsome hero of Waterloo.</p>

<p>His grandson, King William III of the Netherlands, further
restored and embellished Het Loo, laying out the grounds with great
skill and taste and giving to the Palace the present aspect of
costly beauty.</p>

<p>The gardens are now among the most celebrated in the world, and
perhaps it is capricious to regret the old Dutch <i>jardin de
broderie,</i> the formal "Court of Honour," all the decorative
primness of the seventeenth century which distinguished these royal
gardens in the days before picturesque landscape gardening was
conceived and only the artificial was admired.</p>

<p>Het Loo is now the favourite residence of her present Majesty,
who is not only the heiress of the most ancient and illustrious
house now reigning in Europe, but the only woman in the world a
ruling monarch in her own right. Her Majesty's position, her
character and achievements give an added lustre to her noble family
and to that womanhood which has accomplished so much in the last
generation.</p>

<p>This charming and intelligent lady is regarded by her people
with a devotion that amounts to veneration, and it is the prettiest
sight in the world to see Her Majesty in one of her magnificent old
cities, surrounded by her applauding subjects, while the famous
Orange banners stream from every window and roof-top above the
national flag.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>It is easy to understand why Het Loo has been the favourite
residence of so many Princes. The vast woods, reaching to Ellspeet
and from there as far as the heaths of Milligen, must in earlier
days have been superb hunting grounds, and in later, a delicious
defence from the noise and commonplace of the world.</p>

<p>The <i>jachtslot</i> of Het Loo was originally in the possession
of the Bentinck family, who did homage for it as a fief, presenting
to the Dukes of Guelders a hunting horn and two white hinds every
year; the hinds were probably bred for the purpose in the menagerie
then kept by every nobleman of wealth.</p>

<p>When William III built his magnificent new chteau in 1672, he
made the old Castle itself into one of these menageries. The
collection of fantastic-looking beasts he kept there was painted
often by Melchior Hondecoeter. One such picture, now in the
Mauritshuis, once served as an overmantel decoration in Het Loo,
and gives a charming idea of the elegance and oddness of these
stately seventeenth-century menageries.</p>

<p>At Het Loo, too, this King had most of his famous gallery of
pictures, which, though afterwards dispersed, formed the nucleus of
this same collection at The Hague.</p>

<p>In the reign of William III Het Loo must have been, on a smaller
scale, as sumptuous as Versailles and in a good deal better taste
and order. The Earl of Portland wrote to William from Paris that
King Louis's vaunted flower-beds were "very ill-kept"; ill-kept, no
doubt, they were compared to the beautiful exactitude and solid
richness of those of Het Loo, that made the French flourishes seem
a little tawdry.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Zutphen is associated in an English mind with Sir Philip Sidney,
and is hence far better known to us than many a more important
Dutch town. It lies close to the Overijssel frontier and was once
the chief city of the County of Zutphen, a title of the Dukes of
Guelders and even borne by Charles V.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Sidney was killed at Warnveld while besieging
Zutphen, then in possession of the Spaniards, some little way
outside the town, where a pleasant statue has been gracefully
raised to his memory.</p>

<p>Zutphen is finely situated at the juncture of the Yssel and
Berkel, and has an important air, though now it can boast nothing
of its ancient grandeurs, <i>Zutphen de Rykste,</i> save a
considerable timber trade.</p>

<p>Zutphen was taken without resistance by the Spanish in 1572. The
same dreary, bloody tale belongs to most of these fine old towns;
Spanish and French in turn wreaking the vengeance of pride and envy
on an inoffensive, valiant, and laborious people.</p>

<p>In this case the wretched town was almost depopulated. Leicester
tried in vain to re-take it, but was rudely defeated by the Duke of
Parma.</p>

<p>Maurice of Orange finally took the town in 1591. A hundred years
after the entry of the Spaniards Zutphen was seized by the
French.</p>

<p>Zutphen, the Province, was united to Guelders by the marriage of
Sophia, Countess of Zutphen, with Otto of Nassau, Count of
Guelders, and Zutphen has still the atmosphere of an old courtly
city, not a provincial town. It appears gay and well off and to
have recovered from horrors of wars and wearinesses of long
neglect.</p>

<p>Here are the stiff, elegant houses of the better sort (Yssel
kade), the trim gardens, the public walks, the comfortable shops
and cafs, common to all Dutch towns, but there are also the
antique moat and walls, the river Berkel washing the old ramparts,
a medley of old houses with queer gables and faded colours, and the
long tresses of bright trees trailing in the water, while a riot of
flowers cascades from the upper windows&mdash;all this more like
Nuremberg than any other town in the Low Countries.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The Groote Kerk of Zutphen was also, like that of Arnhem, once
dedicated to the Saint on whose festival the witches used to meet
the Devil on the Brocken&mdash;St. Walpurgis, which is very old (twelfth
century), and in consequence very much restored after being very
much neglected.</p>

<p>This grand and rather melancholy church once enjoyed great fame
as the shrine of the relics of St. Justus, an obscure young Roman
saint, who appears, after all, to have been buried in Beauvais.</p>

<p>The present treasures are a delicate and lovely candela-bruin
presented by Otto II of Nassau, Count of Guelders, in the
thirteenth century, of gilded iron in the likeness of an Imperial
Crown, and a superb copper font cast in 1527.</p>

<p>There is also the curious, unique but dark, musty and sad
library of the church, still hoarded in the original room, with
desks and chained folios, very learned, rare, and imposing, albeit
a little tattered, dusty and meaningless, and piteously out of
place as an adjunct to the worthy Calvinist meetinghouse that the
sinister-named St. Walpurgis now is.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The rich and amiable little old city has a few more noteworthy
buildings pressed in among her well-kept, ancient, pretty houses,
including the solid, heavy but pleasing Weigh House of 1618, with
the belfry whose bells were spared by Louvois in 1672, which was
once the "Wynhuis" or Custom House for the duties on Rhenish
wines.</p>

<p>There is a respectable library now housed there and a very
valuable collection of archives, letters, and documents signed by
famous worthies.</p>

<p>One of the old ramparts, the <i>Ruime,</i> remains, still
frowning above the Yssel and the Drogenapstoren. A turreted Gothic
Gate rises majestically above the trees, belfries, and sloping red
roofs, and looks over the blond fields, so fruitful and golden,
that roll to the very banks of the water, gay with the
vivid-painted <i>tjalks</i> that so comfortably indicate peace and
prosperity.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Roermond was once a town of old Guelders, but has since been
united to Limburg, to which Province and Flemish Catholicism it
seems more naturally to belong. There remain in Guelders, of these
old cities, then, imperial Nijmegen, Tiel, and Zalt Bommel on the
Rhine, Loevenstein, the gloomy prison fortress, and Elberg, the
once fortified port, besides numberless chteaux, mansions, and
villages of charm and interest which only the very leisurely
traveller and writer will have opportunity to indulge themselves
with.</p>

<p>Tiel has lost nearly all its importance and contains but few
relics of the mighty past when it received its charter from Otto I
(972). Tiel resisted the Spaniards, but was taken by Turenne in the
<i>ramp jaar.</i> One remnant of the fortifications is the
<i>Kleiberg</i> Gate.</p>

<p>Zalt Bommel was also twice unsuccessfully besieged by the
Spaniards, but fell to Turenne after a fierce defence. It is
situated on the Rhine at the point where the river ceases to be
tidal.</p>

<p>The two sieges of Zalt Bommel, 1574-1599, form each an epic
story of heroism and endurance. It was such triumphant resistances
as those of Zalt Bommel which turned the tide in favour of the
Dutch and caused Alva to withdraw his bloody forces in despair.</p>

<p>The St. Maarten's Kerk of Zalt Bommel has a dignified and lofty
tower which rises with noble effect above the medley of ancient
houses, the ramparts laid out with gracious avenues of trees and
the stretch of river widening to the sea.</p>

<p>This Collegiate Church (fifteenth century) has, as usual, been
burnt down and built up again, and converted at last, peacefully
and happily, if dourly and a little grimly, into the chapel of a
pruned or lopped faith. There are still some ancient wall-paintings
left, and greatly as such relics are admired and cherished, there
seems so little meaning or beauty in them that a glimpse of the
crude daubs usually disfiguring church walls in pre-Reformation
days makes one more favourably inclined to Luther and
whitewash.</p>

<p>The tower, like that of the Groote Kerk of Zutphen, has been
struck and consumed by lightning. These visitations of <i>hemels
vuur</i> seem to have been regarded with no superstitious awe; at
Zutphen these disasters are calmly commemorated by tablets with the
magistrate's name attached. The pedants of the day loved also to
write chronograms and pious rhymes on such events, which, when in a
mixture of dog Latin and Dutch, have a very alluring flavour.</p>

<p>The following, which has a ripe, robust sound indeed, was
inscribed on a bell hung in the tower of St. Maartens, after the
fire of 1538:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Anno vijftien hondert acht en dertig om<br>
Donderde de Toren van Bommel om,<br>
Actum factum donder om!<br>
Heer der Heeren, nooit weer om!"</p>

<br>

<p>John Evelyn, in his journey of 1641, found an English garrison
at Bommel, which he called a "pretty town," after he had taken
farewell of Goring's "Leaguer and Camerades" at Gennap.</p>

<p>Leicester was also at Bommel, where he left a Dutch garrison.
Bommel is also mentioned as one of the earliest towns engaged in
the trade with England&mdash;in the reign of Edward I, the others being
Deventer, Kampen, Zutphen, Muiden, and Zwolle.</p>

<p>The Netherlands were united to England not only by the frequent
intermarriages of the Dutch Princes with the Royal House of
England, but by this constant stream of trade flowing to and fro,
and later, by the various settlements of Dutch refugees in England
and English refugees in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Several Dutch towns belonged to the Hansa, and certainly a
number of the "Almaines" or "Easterlings," who had their English
quarters in the London Steel Yard, must have been Dutch, as they
would now be called, i.e., Hollanders, Zealanders, Brabanters,
Frieslanders, and men from Utrecht and Guelders.</p>

<p>Culembourg, once the seat of the Counts of that name, is another
ancient Guelders town on the Lower Rhine, now reduced to peaceful
insignificance. In 144 Roelof VII of Beusichem gave Culembourg
County to his son Huibert, who built here a fine castle, rebuilt in
1350 and now utterly disappeared.</p>

<p>Culembourg boasts, however, a delightful <i>Stadhuis,</i> built
in 1534 as a residence for Anthony van Lalaing, Count Hoogstraten,
and his wife, Elizabeth van Culembourg. It is a mannered, elegant
building, step gabled, of brick with bulbous-topped tower and
double-winged step, adorned by lions, the arms of Culembourg, and,
formerly, by statues, which have disappeared.</p>

<p>This steep, tall and narrow building, so precise, formal and
exact, yet so ornate and decorative, is as typical a piece of
architecture as is to be found in the country.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Buren, the inheritance of the Egmonts, and through the first
wife of William I of Orange the possession of the House of Orange
(Count of Buren being one of the many titles of these Princes), is
remarkable for an Orphanage endowed by Mary, Countess of Hohenloe,
born Princess of Orange and Countess of Nassau, who died in
1613.</p>

<p>This tasteful building, in old Dutch style, with delicate belfry
and charming brick-and-stone gate, is a delightful memorial of the
connection between the House of Orange and Guelders, and of one of
those admirable women whose kindness and culture make pleasant
relief in dark and wretched times.</p>

<p>Like the sound of a soft feminine voice among all the noise and
tumult of the time is the inscription on this <i>Westhuis,</i>
where the dead Princess seems to plead for living children with
tender piety.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Loevenstein, a proud and gloomy castle above Gorkum, almost on
the borders of North Holland, has a history more important than
that of most Guelders ruins; for here was imprisoned Hugo de Groot,
one of the greatest of Dutchmen, and from here he made his famous
escape, helped by a brave and loyal wife, in a case of books.</p>

<p>Loevenstein, for long a State prison, housed many enemies of the
House of Orange and prisoners of the States-General.</p>

<p>Here was confined Jacob de Witt, Burgomaster of Dordt and father
of John and Cornelius&mdash;the bitter drop of personal enmity between
the De Witts and the House of Orange was, no doubt, caused by this
imprisonment.</p>

<p>Here, too, was imprisoned Sir George Ascue, captured at the
victory of the Dutch on June 4th, 1665, when the <i>Prince</i> and
nine other men-of-war and two thousand prisoners were seized by the
victors. Sir George, after being "carried up and down The Hague,
for people to see," was confined in Loevenstein and afterwards
ransomed for eleven hundred florins.</p>

<p>Sir William Berkeley, another Englishman, was killed in this
same battle, and his embalmed body lay in a sugar-chest in a chapel
of the Groote Kerk at The Hague, "his flag standing up by him."</p>

<p>The corpse was afterwards sent back to England. There was no
complaint of the behaviour of the Dutch Government on this
occasion, though Pepys says of the populace: "It seems the Dutch do
insult mightily of their victory and they have great reason."</p>

<p>One thinks they had indeed. The sympathy of every just-minded
person must be on the side of this patient, brave and inoffensive
people, who had so well won and well used their liberty and
prosperity, and were then so wantonly fallen upon by jealous,
grasping, and arrogant neighbours.</p>

<p>Pepys is often full of admiration for the behaviour of the Dutch
in this war, as when he records their generous treatment of their
prisoners and adds: "which is done like a noble, brave and wise
people."</p>

<p>The English were inclined to blame the Dutch for the "hellish
contrivance" of the Great Fire, 1666, and it is amusing to glance
at the other side of the picture, and see that the Dutch rejoiced
in this same disaster as a Divine Retribution for the destruction
of Vlieland and Terschelling by the English in that year, when a
million pounds' worth of damage was done, and houses and villages
burnt "as bonfires for the success at sea."</p>

<p>To Loevenstein also came in 1675 Abraham de Wicquefort, to live,
as he complained, "in a frightful solitude and only the company of
the family of the gaoler, rats, owls, and bats."</p>

<p>De Wicquefort was an able but dubious personage, accused, with
good reason, of double dealing with the States-General. He had been
a French and then a Dutch spy and, being by birth a Fleming, was
probably not true to either side.</p>

<p>He accused the young Stadtholder of being the author of his
downfall; for not only had he been a close friend of John de Witt,
but had written rather too boldly of William in his official
<i>History of the United Provinces.</i></p>

<p>This curious work has been the foundation for many subsequent
histories of the Low Countries, but De Wicquefort, as so many
historians of their own times are, was prejudiced and hasty, and
his statements need testing.</p>

<p>Evidently he was not kept very closely in his frightful prison,
for he contrived to escape after four years, and fled to Zell in
Brunswick, where he continued his history, with, one may be sure,
even more prejudice than before against the Prince of Orange and
with long-winded "passion, pains, and prolixity."</p>

<p>De Wicquefort possessed both wit and learning. It was he who
said, about the delays anent the bringing of William II's bride by
her mother, that it depended on three of the most uncertain things
in the world&mdash;the wind, a woman, and the Parliament of England.</p>

<p>Through the Resident of the Duke of Luxembourg Wicquefort seems
to have been trusted with the translating of the English letters
received by the States and the Prince of Orange. A certain secret
correspondence of the latter with Lord Howard came into
Wicquefort's hands and he sold it to Sir Joseph Williamson, the
English Minister, in 1675. Lord Howard was put in the Tower, and
saved only by the Dutch threat to execute Wicquefort if he was
touched, a menace, which, curiously, had effect.</p>

<p>Wicquefort was "clapt up," as the saying went, on his refusal to
produce the originals of the papers entrusted to him. He mentions
bitterly that the Prince of Orange watched him led off with
satisfaction, for which the young Stadtholder need not be blamed.
Despite his complaints, De Wicquefort seems to have been well
treated in Loevenstein.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Lerdam and Arkel are delicious old-world towns, the former with
an entrancing ancient harbour, and Elberg, on the Zuyder Zee, is a
fine example of a fortified haven, once of considerable importance
and renown and still of vast interest, as examples of fortified
harbours dating from the Middle Ages are rare enough.</p>

<p>One of the four watchful gates remains and is in the highest
degree picturesque and romantic. Some of the sturdy walls still
stand, and are now adorned with coquettish summer-houses and
graceful clusters of trees.</p>

<p>The view from Elberg is lovely, both over sea and land; the
fruitful lush meadows, that seem to run down to the very waves,
roll into the sullen, sterile heaths of Guelders and the moorlands
that border the Yssel, or into the deep groves of the fair woods of
Putten.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Nijmegen is the most venerable city in Guelders, indeed in the
Netherlands, but seems a little outside the history of both. It was
Charlemagne's second city, coming next to Aix-la-Chapelle, the
imperial capital of the Lower Rhine.</p>

<p>It is very different in appearance from the flat cities of the
plains and swamps, for it rises grandly from the left bank of the
broad Waal and is nobly crowned by the towering church.</p>

<p>The town is indeed built on a slight hill, one of an
amphitheatre of seven, which seems considerable after the flats of
Holland, and the roofs rise one above the other to the summit,
where are the market-place and church.</p>

<p>The views from Nijmegen, though marred by the inevitable railway
bridge, are superb, excelling those in the environs of Arnhem and
Cleves. From the Belvedere can be seen one of the most historic and
imposing landscapes in North Europe&mdash;four famous rivers, the Waal,
Maas, Rhine and Yssel, watering that rich district known as Betuwe
(the original "Batavia" of the Romans), and in the distance Arnhem
and Cleves, together with eight other towns and fifty villages.</p>

<p>The history of Nijmegen belongs to that of the Empire of the
Carlovingians; it has little to do with the Netherlands as they are
to-day. Here is no neat, solid, Republican town, but a rather
melancholy, regal and gloomy city that seems asleep in a dream of
ruined pride. Not the most flourishing suburbs, the most efficient
of railway stations, the most well-kept of spacious parks can
efface this effect.</p>

<p>Nijmegen became afterwards a free imperial town and a member of
the Hansa League. In 1579 she became a member of the Union of
Utrecht, and so lost her personal history, but not her powerful,
sombre individuality.</p>

<p>Nijmegen fell to the Spaniards in 1585, was re-taken by Maurice
of Orange in 1591; Turenne occupied the town in 1672 and held it
till 1678, when the Peace signed within these walls returned the
old imperial city to the young Republic.</p>

<p>It is by this Peace that Nijmegen is best known in the history
books. Sir William Temple, the English delegate, has left an
amusing picture of his being ferried across the Waal in a coach and
six, when the salvos fired by the town in his honour so frightened
the horses that they stampeded and nearly cast the grave Ambassador
and his suite into the river. "However," says Sir William, "by the
aid of my servants we safely reached the other side."</p>

<p>It is not, however, of Nijmegen as a peaceful, stately Dutch
town, a worthy member of the United Provinces, with burgomaster and
citizens, that one thinks, though this is what the venerable city
has been for a good number of years now, but rather of those
far-off royal days, the atmosphere of which so powerfully
remains.</p>

<p>On the top of the hill on which the town is built rises not only
the massive church, but the <i>Stadhuis</i> and the old Grammar
School, indeed the centre of the life of the town.</p>

<p>Despite big modern shops, bustle and hurry, this part of
Nijmegen still retains a peculiar air, which, on turning into the
church enclosure, becomes all-prevailing. It is a melancholy,
musty, decayed air, the flavour of something so old as to be nearly
meaningless.</p>

<p>This church, dedicated to St. Stephen, is not attractively set
about with neat tiny houses, comely trees and an open square, as in
most Dutch towns, but is huddled away behind other buildings,
closed in, stifled, and has a penetrating air of neglect and
oblivion. It is by the low, dark arches at the bottom of one of the
gabled houses of the Groot Markt that we enter the pent-in
courtyard of the church with which time has not dealt too gently,
for damp and wind have crumbled the soft stone of which it was
built, and great holes in the walls have been filled up with
brick.</p>

<p>The original church was built on, it is said, an early Christian
cemetery, by the Dutch Kaiser William II, Count of Holland, and
dedicated to St., Stephen and the Virgin by Albert, Bishop of
Ratisbon, September 7th, 1273. It is doubtful if Kaiser William
paid for the stately building since, like most potentates of his
time, he was continually in want of money, and pledged Nijmegen
itself for twenty-one thousand silver marks.</p>

<p>Very little is left of this early edifice; the church as we see
it now is late fifteenth century, very impressive and fine, with
the massive aisles and pentagon chapels and clustered pillars, but
somehow sombre and sad to a degree, and with an odd air of neglect
unusual in Dutch churches and certainly more fanciful than real.
There are a few old bas-reliefs, much damaged, some late
wainscoting, and one sombre treasure, the dark and lonely tomb of
Lord Philip de Comines, "Young Madam of Guelderland," Catherine de
Bourbon, wife of the deposed Duke Adolf and mother of Charles
Egmont, last Duke of Guelders.</p>

<p>It was at the Court of her brother-in-law, Charles the Bold,
that she met Adolf Egmont, and she was married to him in 1463 at
Bruges. Her short life was disturbed and unhappy; her husband was
excommunicated by the Pope, put under the ban of the Empire, and
fallen upon by Charles the Bold and the Duke of Cleves.</p>

<p>Catherine de Bourbon left the pleasant shelter of the Burgundian
Court, where she was greatly loved, and joined the stormy fortunes
of her cursed and menaced husband. She died soon after in 1469, at
Nijmegen, no doubt of fatigue and distress, as many women must have
died in those fierce and terrible times.</p>

<p>Catherine's unhappy lord, Duke Adolf, was scarcely deserving of
this tender loyalty; it is of him De Comines describes that fearful
picture of youth bustling age off the world's stage.</p>

<p>He seized his father, Duke Arnald, one night as he was going to
bed, and dragged him six Dutch miles in his shirt "on a marvellous
cold night," and thrust him into the usual airless dungeon. It was
this behaviour that caused the Pope, the Emperor, the Duke of
Cleves (the old man's brother-in-law) to make war on Adolf.</p>

<p>The Duke of Burgundy tried to act as peacemaker and forcibly
took Duke Arnald out of prison.</p>

<p>"I have often seen them," writes De Comines, "together in the
Duke of Burgundy's chamber pleading their cause...and once I saw
the old man offer combat to his son."</p>

<p>A dreadful scene.</p>

<p>Charles the Bold favoured the young man who was, no doubt, after
his own type, and offered him all Guelders with the exception of
Grave, and a revenue of three thousand florins to be left to his
father, who was to be called Duke, while the young Adolf should be
entitled Governor of Guelders.</p>

<p>De Comines had to take these terms to Adolf, who instantly
replied "that he would rather throw his father headlong into a well
than agree to such conditions," adding that his father had reigned
forty-four years and it was now his turn.</p>

<p>Charles of Burgundy finally put this fierce spirit under
restraint, but Adolf escaped in disguise to his own country, yet
betrayed himself at Namur, where he offered a guilder for the
ferry. He was recaptured and held a prisoner at Namur, where he
remained till the death of the Duke of Burgundy in 1477, when, set
free by the men of Ghent, he, "being weakly accompanied, was
miserably slain in a skirmish before Tournay."</p>

<p>The spirit of the warlike Guelders people appears to have been
on the side of Adolf in this dismal quarrel, particularly that of
the citizens of Nijmegen, who were reputed to be never happy "save
when they had swords in their hands." When made prisoner the old
Duke begged, with tears in his eyes, not to be taken to
Nijmegen.</p>

<p>The gentle Catherine de Bourbon had long been in her grave when
her turbulent lord was released, and bitterly he must have
regretted her, for it is certain that she had truly loved him
despite his misfortune and his crimes.</p>

<p>These sweet and patient, soft and fragile women, of whom history
takes so little account, did generally love and adore their stern
and fierce husbands, as was but natural, the true woman forming the
perfect mate for the true man.</p>

<p>As the men were born and bred, trained and formed for power,
war, domination, and arrogance, so the women were born and bred,
trained and formed for meekness, obedience, timidity, and
gentleness.</p>

<p>There is still something in the highest degree romantic and
lovely in the mating of these opposite qualities, the love of the
soft, helpless woman for the bold, masterful man; something we have
lost, or nearly lost to-day, finding other things in its place, no
doubt, but definitely lost, with the equality and merging of the
sexes.</p>

<p>The type of the medieval knight, ruthless, virile, cruel,
splendid, has gone&mdash;fortunately it may be, inevitably it must
be&mdash;yet it is easy to understand the devotion they inspired in
their gentle wives and the real passion that must have existed
between men who were completely men and women who were completely
women.</p>

<p>The tomb of poor Catherine de Bourbon is of black marble, set
with copper plates on which are engraved saints and the arms of
Egmont, Valois, and Bourbon. On the top is the likeness of the
"Young Madam of Guelderland" herself.</p>

<p>The whole air of the tomb is even more lonely and gloomy than
that of her son in Arnhem, a dreary bit of wreckage from the past
indeed.</p>

<p>On opening the tomb some fifty years or more ago it was found
that the body of the princess had been huddled away in a corner,
while her former place was occupied, curiously enough, by a Duke of
Saxony lying in State robes in a pompous coffin. The bitter luck of
the Egmonts seemed to pursue them and theirs after death.</p>

<p>The author of the tomb was Master Leomans of Cologne.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The <i>Stadhuis</i> of Nijmegen is unusual and august in
appearance, though simple; the date is 1554, when the free imperial
city was a member of the Hansa and commercially very
prosperous.</p>

<p>It is adorned by statues of Emperors (the present ones are
copies of the original), these being different indeed from the
usual personages on Dutch Town Halls.</p>

<p>The vestibule, once the Courts of Justice, is beautiful, with
raised seats carved by Gerard van Dulcken (1555) and three superb
doors and a most majestic, wonderful clock. In this building is
housed the municipal collection of antiquities and several glorious
drinking-cups, tapestries, and pictures; those of local interest
including portraits of the dull-looking personages who signed the
Peace of Nijmegen, 1678, an odd painting called "The Riddle of
Nijmegen," and, best of all, a view of the old Valkhof by John van
Goyen or one of his pupils.</p>

<p>Here also are many prehistoric Roman and Teutonic remains found
in the neighbourhood of Nijmegen, those broken relics of the past
that somehow mean so little, and in their broken decay help us not
at all to visualise the pompous ages from which they come.</p>

<p>Two allegorical paintings by obscure artists, Rutger van
Langevelt and Stevens Palamady, are curious as commemorating the
old dues which Nijmegen had to pay to the Empire&mdash;a glove full of
pepper, or pair of deerskin gloves and a pound of pepper, as some
say, to be forwarded every year to Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<p>A huge press, with a lock of almost magic complication, held the
precious charters of Nijmegen, many of which are still in
existence, though of little meaning now.</p>

<p>These include charters from Henry VII, 1250, Richard, 1257,
Rudolf, 1282, and many potentates who delighted in enriching and
protecting Nijmegen.</p>

<p>The Grammar School (1544) and the Weigh House and Flesher's Hall
(1612), the last probably by De Keyser, are notable buildings, as
is the house called still after Martin van Rossem, where that
terrible worthy is supposed to have at one time resided.</p>

<p>The whole of the Groot Markt is charming in effect, and there is
no lack of curious old houses, doorways, and angles, nooks and odd
views among the medley of houses which lead up from the Waal to the
melancholy darkness of St. Stephen's.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>In the amiable and luxurious pleasure grounds of the Valkhof,
laid out on one of the hills above the Waal, the main excitement of
a visit to Nijmegen centres.</p>

<p>These grim gardens were once the site of the Imperial Castle of
Nijmegen, the Valkhof (from <i>Valkenberg,</i> falconry, or from
<i>Wallhof,</i> Castle on the Wall), which was older than the town,
for a fort stood on this commanding position before a city was
added to the citadel, and this was in the dim, traditional ages,
for a vague Celt, or Gaul, or Teuton, called Baton, is supposed to
have walled and restored the fort in pre-Roman days.</p>

<p>The Romans called it "Noviomagus," calling the town "Batavorum
oppidum," and here we come out of the mists of legend into
well-attested fact; for here Julius Civilius, the rebel Roman,
watched his troops defeated on the shining plains below by the
orderly legions of Rome, whose glittering eagles bore down the
lusty Batavians.</p>

<p>The exact spot is supposed to have been the Watch-tower, or
Belvedere, a fragment of the old walls from which a glorious view,
looking much as it must have looked in the time of the discomfited
Julius, can still be enjoyed, though the tower itself only dates
from 1646.</p>

<p>This most impressive view embraces Limburg, North Brabant and
Guelders, and a distant panorama stretching as far as Cleves.</p>

<p>The Castle, once so famous, so gorgeous and so splendid, has
entirely disappeared save for two small and rather pitiful
fragments.</p>

<p>In 1799 the superb old imperial building was utterly demolished
and public promenades laid out.</p>

<p>Charlemagne either built or rebuilt a castle on the old Roman
foundations here in 777, and it became the seat of the Court and
the centre of the Empire under subsequent Carlovingian, Saxon,
Frankish, and Hohenstaufen Emperors.</p>

<p>Theopano, Empress of Otto II, died here in 991, Henry III, and
Gunhilda of Denmark were married here in 1036, in 1165 Henry VI,
son of Barbarossa and father of Frederic II, was born here.
Charlemagne, his son Louis, Charles the Bold, Otto I, Conrad III,
Sigismund and Albert, all held their Imperial Court here, and
later, two more famous Csars, Maximilian I and his grandson,
Charles V, lodged here, as did Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy,
Charles of Egmont, Duke of Guelders, and Philip II, King of
Spain.</p>

<p>Some of the most ornate and pompous scenes, some of the most
imposing displays of gold and purple, might and pride, glitter and
arrogance known to European history must have taken place within
the walls of the Valkhof where these Christian Caesars held their
Court with as much worldly parade as ever did their pagan
namesakes.</p>

<p>The two remains of all this magnificence do not mean very much.
The largest is a sixteen-sided chapel about which antiquaries do
not yet appear to be agreed. It is supposed to be contemporary with
Charlemagne and then to have been rebuilt as late as the thirteenth
century, others have put it back to pre-Roman times and call it a
Temple of Thor, or again, a Temple of Janus, while other opinions
ascribe it to the ninth or tenth century.</p>

<p>It is certainly too small to have been the Imperial Chapel of
the Castle, but may have been the Baptistery thereof. This queer
little building, with double-vaulted galleries and carved arches,
is, at any rate, the oldest religious building in the Netherlands,
and was certainly some part of the old Imperial Palace. It is
unlikely it is older than the Carlovingian period, and it certainly
has been, if not rebuilt, touched up and partially restored.</p>

<p>The other fragment is more impressive. It is a hemicircle with a
demi-cupola pierced by tall, elegant windows and flanked by fine
white marble columns. There is less dispute about the date of this;
it is given to the time of Frederic Barbarossa, and is supposed to
be the recess in which stood the massive throne of that mighty
King.</p>

<p>Berg en Daal (mountain and valley) and Beek, about three miles
outside Nijmegen, contain some of the loveliest spots in the
Netherlands, and command some of the most entrancing views along
the Rhine.</p>

<p>The pearly, dusky, dewy, delicious roses of Guelders are justly
famous; but though the viburnum grows in luscious profusion in this
Province, an explanation was sought in vain as to why it was called
"Guelder Rose" in English. Should the word be "guilder"? In either
case it is a teasing little puzzle, as these pretty names of
flowers so often are; but in one person's mind at least the pure
white balls of blossom that hang so richly among the faint-coloured
leaves will always, and senselessly, be associated with gallant
Guelders.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>A touching story tells of the great bell of Nijmegen, which was
called "Charlemagne's prayer," and rang hoarsely at curfew. A
burgomaster stopped the noisy old bell, but was forced to restore
the "prayer" to the city, so greatly did the people still cherish
the memory of Kaiser Karl.</p>
