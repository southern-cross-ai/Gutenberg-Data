  <p class="quote"><i>Stories from the History of Rome</i>, by Mrs. Beesly
  (Macmillan), is a little book, unadorned indeed by pictures, but of elegant
  appearance, and such as should please the more intelligent class of young
  readers. Mrs. Beesly tells us the legends, mythical and semi-historical, of
  Rome, the preface rightly disposing of the very narrow fiction that these
  legends are not true. They are not true to fact, but they are to nature; and
  they certainly "helped to create in Romans those virtues which they professed
  to record." Dr. Arnold interspersed his history with such legends. In the
  volume before us, they are told in a simple and less poetical form, but in a
  pleasing and interesting way.</p>

  <h2><a id="pre"
     name="pre"></a>PREFACE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE writer of this little book was not satisfied that her
  children should hear nothing but fairy tales and the stories of nursery life,
  now so popular. But she could find nothing else fit to read to them. There
  are, indeed, plenty of story-books drawing their materials from history, and
  professing to be intended for children. But they are not suited to very young
  children. They abound in words and ideas which a child of four or six years
  old not only does not understand, but cannot be made to understand. The
  writer, however, believed that it was quite possible to put portions of Livy
  and Plutarch into language which should need little or no explanation even to
  children of that age. She accordingly made the experiment. One story after
  another was written and read to her little boys. Whenever she discovered that
  a word or idea was unintelligible to them, she took pains to simplify it. She
  found that they thoroughly enjoyed these old tales from Roman history, and
  liked to hear them repeated again and again. She has thought, therefore, that
  if published they might perhaps supply a want that may have been felt by
  other parents.</p>

  <p>It was necessary that the stories should be such as would interest little
  children. But the writer has also selected them with a view to illustrate the
  two sentiments most characteristic of Roman manners&mdash;duty to parents and
  duty to country. She has, moreover, tried to indicate that the latter of
  these sentiments took precedence of the former. A healthy moral lesson is
  thus conveyed, while at the same time the most essential feature of the Roman
  civilization is impressed on the memory.</p>

  <p>Probably no one will be found to raise the dull objection that many of
  these tales are not strictly true. Being typical of Roman manners, they are
  true in a more real sense than many a well attested but less, characteristic
  fact. They undoubtedly helped to create in Romans those virtues which they
  professed to record. To the young, aye, and to older persons, it is more
  important to have heard that Brutus beheaded his sons and that Mucius thrust
  his hand into the flame, than to be acquainted with the most approved
  theories as to the origin of the Plebs or the functions of the three Comitia.
  May it be long before these old legends are banished from Roman history in
  the name of a pedantic and unprofitable accuracy!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE BUILDING OF ROME</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE once reigned in a town called Alba in Italy a king
  whose name was Numitor. He had a brother called Amulius, who was a proud and
  wicked man, and could not bear that his elder brother should be king over
  him. So Amulius plotted against his brother. He got together a number of men
  who were as bad and cruel as himself, and they attacked Numitor and drove him
  from his throne, and made Amulius king in his stead. They took the sons of
  Numitor, and his daughter Rhea Silvia, and killed them. Then Amulius seized
  the two little sons of Rhea Silvia, who were still only babies; he gave them
  to his soldiers, and told them to throw the poor little boys into the River
  Tiber.</p>

  <p>"Then," thought he, "they will be drowned. There will be none of my
  brother's children left to trouble me, and I shall be king all my life."</p>

  <p>The soldiers took the two babies in their cradle, lying side by side fast
  asleep, and carried them to the river.</p>

  <p>Now, there had been a great deal of rain, and the Tiber had overflowed its
  banks, so that the men could not put the children in the deep part of the
  river, but only at the edge, where the water was shallow. However, they
  thought that they would have obeyed the orders of Amulius if they left the
  little boys there. So they put the cradle down in the water, and went
  away.</p>

  <p>But the sun was shining, and the waters were sinking fast; soon the dry
  land began to show itself; the cradle stood still, and the waters left it on
  the bank and ran back into their bed.</p>

  <p>There lived not far from the Tiber a shepherd whose name was Faustulus. He
  was walking by the side of the river, when he saw a cradle lying under a
  fig-tree, and beside the cradle stood a great she-wolf. Faustulus was very
  much astonished, and ran quickly to see what this might mean. When he got
  near, he saw that in the cradle were two beautiful little baby boys, and the
  wolf was feeding them with her milk, just as if they had been her own little
  ones. But when she saw Faustulus, she fled away into the woods; and he took
  the children and carried them home to his wife. So these two kind people
  loved the boys and brought them up like their own sons.</p>

  <p>Romulus and Remus, so the boys were called, grew up strong and bold and
  active. They did not care to till the ground and herd the cattle, but loved
  to hunt in the woods and mountains. Sometimes, too, they would attack the
  robbers whom they met in that wild land, and take their plunder from them.
  So, it happened that many young men from the country round came to them and
  joined their expeditions, and of these Romulus and Remus were always the
  chiefs and leaders.</p>

  <p>Faustulus had heard that two grandsons of the king had been thrown into
  the Tiber, and he guessed that these must be the boys he had found. When
  Numitor, their old grandfather, heard of these two young men, he too thought
  they must be his daughter's sons. Then Romulus and Remus took their friends
  and companions with them, and went to Alba. They attacked King Amulius and
  killed him. When Numitor heard of what had happened, he called the Alban
  nobles together, and told them of all the wrongs he had borne from his
  brother, and all the story of his grandsons. While he was still speaking, the
  two brothers marched with their followers into the midst of the assembly, and
  they hailed their grandfather as King of Alba, to the great joy of all the
  Alban people.</p>

  <p>Now Romulus and Remus were not content to stay at Alba with their old
  grandfather; but they determined to build a new city for themselves. They
  made up their minds that this new city should be near the River Tiber, on the
  spot where they were found by Faustulus when they were little babies. So they
  took their companions with them, and went to that place. There was still
  growing the fig-tree under which their cradle had lain, and they resolved
  that they would build their walls there, and leave the fig-tree standing in
  the midst. For hundreds of years afterwards the fig-tree was to be seen
  standing in one of the chief streets of Rome.</p>

  <p>The walls were soon begun, but while they were building, the two young men
  began to quarrel. Remus spoke scornfully to his brother and laughed at him,
  and jumped over the wall that Romulus had just begun to raise. Romulus was
  very angry, and in his rage he struck his brother and killed him.</p>

  <p>Thus he became the only leader and king. He finished building the city,
  which he called Rome after his own name. He ruled it for many years, and
  after his death the Romans worshipped him as a god.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE HORATII AND THE CURIATII</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the reign of King Tullus Hostilius there was a quarrel
  between the people of Rome and the people of Alba. The Romans and the Albans
  were generally very friendly to each other. They were of the same race; their
  way of living was the same, and they spoke the same language. Some of the
  Romans had married Alban women, and some of the Albans had married Roman
  women, so that each people had friends and relations in the other town.</p>

  <p>But now there was a quarrel between them, and the Roman army with King
  Tullus at its head marched out to meet the Albans, who were commanded by
  their Dictator, Mettius Fufetius.</p>

  <p>When the armies came near together, the Alban Dictator sent a messenger to
  King Tullus. The messenger came to the Roman army, and was led before the
  king, who was preparing himself for the battle.</p>

  <p>Now, Tullus was a brave warrior; he was young and strong, and eager to win
  glory in war; but still he was wise, and he did not refuse to listen to the
  message of Mettius. "O Tullus," said the messenger, "I am sent to you by the
  Dictator of the Albans. He bids me tell you, that it will be much for the
  good of Rome as well as for the good of Alba if you will come out in front of
  your army, and speak with him before the fight begins."</p>

  <p>Tullus agreed to do as Mettius asked. The two armies took their places,
  and all was made ready for battle; and then Mettius and Tullus, followed by
  some of their nobles, advanced midway between the armies, and Mettius spoke
  these words,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Hear me, King Tullus, and you nobles of Rome. It seems to me that the
  only cause of our quarrel is that we know not whether Rome or Alba is the
  stronger, and which town shall be the master of the other. Can we not decide
  this in some other way than by the death of all the brave men who must be
  slain if we begin to fight?"</p>

  <p>The thought pleased King Tullus, and after consulting together, they fixed
  upon a plan. It was agreed that three Romans should fight against three
  Albans, and that if the Romans conquered, Rome should govern Alba; but if the
  Albans were victorious, then Alba should govern Rome.</p>

  <p>It happened that in the Roman army there were three brothers called
  Horatius, all strong men and brave soldiers. They were the sons of an old
  Roman named Publius Horatius, who had taught them, as Roman fathers in those
  days taught their sons, that they ought to be ready to die for the good of
  their people and their dear city of Rome. That was the first duty of every
  Roman, and you shall hear how the Horatii kept their father's sayings.</p>

  <p>The Roman army felt that they could choose no better champions than these
  three brothers. And the Horatii proudly and gladly agreed to fight, and each
  in his heart resolved to do his very best to save his country from being
  subject to Alba.</p>

  <p>Now in the Alban army there were also three brothers, whose name was
  Curiatius. They too were good soldiers, and their countrymen chose them to
  fight for Alba. These three brothers were friends of the Horatii, such dear
  friends that one of them had promised to marry the sister of Horatius. But
  they loved their town of Alba, and like the Romans they felt that they must
  lose their own lives, or take those of their friends, for the sake of their
  country.</p>

  <p>When the Roman King and the Alban Dictator had promised solemnly that Rome
  and Alba should keep the agreement, the three brothers on each side took
  their weapons and marched out between the two armies. The soldiers of both
  towns sat down on each side, to watch the fight, with anxious hearts, knowing
  that the fate of their country depended on the courage and skill of those few
  men.</p>

  <p>At first the battle seemed very equal, for the six were all good soldiers
  and full of bravery; their hearts were set on winning the victory, and they
  were not thinking of the wounds or death that they might suffer in the
  struggle. But soon it seemed that the Albans were getting the better, for two
  of the Romans were killed, but the Albans were all wounded. The Alban army
  shouted for joy; they thought their victory was won, as they saw the three
  Curiatii surround the one Horatius who was still alive and unhurt. But cries
  of anger broke from the Romans when they saw their last champion turn and fly
  from his enemies.</p>

  <p>"Shame on the coward!" they cried; "the name of Horatius is disgraced for
  ever. Better he had died gloriously doing his duty like his brothers."</p>

  <p>But they soon saw that Horatius was no coward, and that his flight was
  only a way to separate the three Albans, who all together would have been
  more than a match for him. Horatius knew that all the Curiatii were wounded.
  As he fled they followed him, and soon the one who was least wounded came up
  to him. Horatius turned instantly to attack him. The combat was fierce, and
  lasted for some time; the Roman and Alban armies eagerly watched the two
  champions, and the two other Curiatii tried hard to reach their brother to
  help him. But they were wounded and could not move fast, and before they
  could come up they saw their brother fall. Still they came forward; the one
  who was least wounded hastened on, and Horatius, joyful with his victory,
  stepped out to meet him. The Alban, bleeding and out of breath with the haste
  he had made, had no chance with the conqueror; and the third brother,
  dragging himself on with difficulty, yet with no thought of yielding, saw him
  die, and knew that he was left alone.</p>

  <p>Then Horatius sprang forward to meet him, crying out,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Two of these brothers have died by my hand. Now the third shall follow
  them, that Rome may rule over Alba!"</p>

  <p>Having said this he stabbed Curiatius, and so died the last of the Alban
  brothers.</p>

  <p>When the Romans saw that their enemies were slain they shouted for joy,
  and Mettius the Alban Dictator came to King Tullus, and asked him if he had
  any commands for him; for he remembered the agreement that had been made
  between them before the fight began. Tullus told him to take his army safely
  back to Alba, but he said that the Albans must keep themselves ready to help
  him in war, if he should want them.</p>

  <p>So the armies departed to their homes, after having buried the five
  brothers who had fallen. The graves of the two Romans were together; those of
  the Albans were separate, in the places where they died. Hundreds of years
  afterwards their tombs were still to be seen.</p>

  <p>Great was the joy in Rome when news came from the camp that Horatius was
  victorious; the people decked their houses with garlands and hung them with
  bright-coloured cloths, and came in crowds flocking to see the brave man who
  had saved Rome. The army marched in at the gate of the city, and in the front
  came Horatius, carrying in his hands the swords of the three Curiatii, and
  wearing on his shoulders the mantle that one of them had worn. And the people
  cried to the gods to bless their champion, and the women threw flowers and
  laurel boughs on his helmet and under his feet as he went along.</p>

  <p>But there was one person in Rome whose heart was sad that day, and that
  was the sister of Horatius, when she heard that her brother had killed the
  man who was in a little while to have been her husband. In her grief and
  despair she ran out to meet Horatius, with her head uncovered and her hair
  loose on her shoulders; and when she met him she saw that he was wearing the
  mantle that she herself had embroidered and given to Curiatius. Then, in a
  voice of sorrow, she called out the name of Curiatius, and told Horatius that
  he was a cruel brother to her, because he had killed the man she loved so
  well.</p>

  <p>The words she said made Horatius very angry.</p>

  <p>"What," cried he, "do you forget your two brothers who are dead, and your
  brother who is still alive, and your country, which I have this day
  saved!"</p>

  <p>Then in his rage he drew his sword, and stabbed his sister to the heart,
  so that she died, saying,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"So may it be done to every maid who is a Roman, and weeps for the death
  of an enemy!"</p>

  <p>The people of Rome were very much shocked at what Horatius had done, and
  they took him and led him before the king, who then spoke to the people, and
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I will choose two judges to judge this man, and to say what shall be done
  to him."</p>

  <p>And so he did. Then the judges said that Horatius must be slain. But he
  cried out, and said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Let me be tried by the whole people, and let them say if I deserve to be
  punished."</p>

  <p>So the king called the people to meet together to try Horatius for having
  killed his sister. And when the people were assembled Horatius came before
  them, and with him was his old father, Publius Horatius.</p>

  <p>In Rome a father was able to do as he pleased with his son, even after the
  son had grown up to be a man&mdash;he could sell him as a slave, or put him
  to death, or punish him in any way he chose; but Publius Horatius did not
  wish to give his son a severe punishment, for he thought that his daughter
  deserved to die. The father and the son were of the same temper&mdash;they
  loved their country better than they loved their family.</p>

  <p>The old man stood up before the people and spoke to them.</p>

  <p>"My daughter," said he, "has been rightly punished, for she forgot her
  duty, and loved a stranger better than she loved Rome. Do not take away from
  me my last child, but remember that I have already lost two brave sons, who
  died in battle for their country."</p>

  <p>Then he threw one arm round his son, and pointing with the other hand to
  the armour and weapons of the Curiatii, which had been hung up on a pillar in
  the open square where the people were met,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"O Romans," he cried, "could you bear to see this young man die
  shamefully, whom you saw a little while ago marching as a victor through the
  streets of Rome? Would you chain these hands which have just won freedom and
  empire for the Roman people? Where would you kill him? Inside the walls where
  you see the spoils and weapons which he won from your enemies, or outside the
  city in sight of the graves where the Curiatii lie buried?"</p>

  <p>The people were sorry to see his father's tears, and were surprised that
  Horatius himself showed no fear of death; they wondered at his courage, and
  remembered that he had saved them from being subjects of Alba, and they
  said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We will pardon Horatius, because he has done such great things for the
  good town of Rome."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; BRUTUS AND HIS SONS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE last king who reigned in Rome was called Tarquin the
  Proud. The Romans hated him because of his pride and cruelty; and at last his
  wickedness and the wickedness of his sons enraged the people so much, that
  they rose against him, and drove him and all his family away from Rome. The
  people resolved that they would never more have a king to govern them, but
  that they would choose two of the best and bravest nobles of Rome to be their
  rulers. These two chiefs were called consuls, and they were to govern the
  city for one year only, after which new consuls were to be chosen.</p>

  <p>The two first consuls were Collatinus Tarquinius and Lucius Junius Brutus.
  Both of these men had been leaders of the people in driving out the king.
  Both were relations to Tarquin, and both had suffered great wrongs from him.
  Lucius feared that Tarquin would kill him, as he had killed others of the
  chief men of Rome, and for years he pretended to be so stupid and foolish
  that the people gave him the surname of Brutus, which means foolish.</p>

  <p>But when the people of Rome at last rose up against the wicked Tarquin,
  Brutus put himself at their head, and soon showed by his wise and brave
  conduct that he had been only acting or pretending to be stupid, that he
  might live unharmed by the cruel king.</p>

  <p>Tarquin for a long time tried hard to get back to Rome. Among the young
  Roman nobles were several who had been friends of the young princes, and who
  would have been glad to bring the Tarquins back, for they cared more for
  their own amusements than that the people should be free. Two of these young
  nobles were Titus and Tiberius, the sons of Brutus.</p>

  <p>These young men met together one night to talk over their plans, and they
  wrote letters to Tarquin telling him they were ready to help him, and sent
  messengers to him with the letters. But it happened that a slave named
  Vindicius was in the room where they met. He did not mean to watch what they
  were doing, but he saw them come hastily into the room with anxious faces,
  and feeling afraid, he hid himself behind a large chest, and so heard all
  that was said.</p>

  <p>When they had gone away Vindicius came out of his hiding place, and was at
  first greatly puzzled what to do. He was afraid to go to the Consul Brutus,
  and to tell him that his two sons were plotting to bring King Tarquin back.
  At last he determined that he would go to Valerius, a noble Roman who from
  his great love for the people was afterwards called Poplicola, which means
  the people's friend.</p>

  <p>So Vindicius went to Valerius, and told him all his story. Valerius was
  very much astonished, and ordered that Vindicius should be kept safely in his
  house, while he himself went, with as many armed friends and slaves as he
  could get together in a hurry, to the house of one of the plotters. They
  broke open the doors, and found the letters to King Tarquin in the room of
  the messengers, who had not yet started on their journey.</p>

  <p>The consuls sat to judge the people in the Forum, or market place, with
  their lictors beside them. The lictors were the consuls' guards, and were
  armed with a bundle of sticks or rods in which an axe was tied up; and they
  punished any one who was condemned by the consuls, either by beating him or
  by cutting off his head.</p>

  <p>The young men were brought before the consuls. When they were accused of
  plotting to bring back the king, and the letters found by Valerius were read
  aloud, and the story of the slave Vindicius had been heard, they did not dare
  to say that they were not guilty.</p>

  <p>The people were sorry for Brutus when they saw his sons led before him to
  be judged, and some said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Would it not be punishment enough if the young men were banished for all
  their lives from Rome?"</p>

  <p>Collatinus, the second consul, shed tears, and Valerius did not speak a
  word. But Brutus looked sternly on his sons.</p>

  <p>"Titus and Tiberius," he said, "why do you not answer to the accusation
  these men bring against you?"</p>

  <p>Three times he asked them this question, but still they did not dare to
  answer a word, for they knew they were guilty and deserved to be punished.
  Then Brutus turned to the lictors.</p>

  <p>"You," said he, "must do all the rest that has to be done."</p>

  <p>So the lictors seized the young men, tied their hands behind them, beat
  them with their rods, and afterwards cut off their heads. Then Brutus left
  his seat and went home to his own house.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; How Lars Porsenna Besieged Rome</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN King Tarquin was driven out of Rome he went to Clusium
  in Etruria, where reigned a great and powerful king called Lars Porsenna.
  Tarquin hoped that by the help of Porsenna and his Etruscan allies he might
  be able to conquer the people of Rome and so make himself king again. So he
  came before Porsenna and begged for his help.</p>

  <p>"Do not," he said, "allow these Romans to banish us from their city.
  Remember that kings should be always ready to help each other; for if the
  peoples of Italy see that the Romans can drive out their king without being
  punished for it, they too will try to get rid of their kings, for all men
  love freedom."</p>

  <p>Porsenna listened to all that Tarquin said. He was sorry for the old man,
  who had been obliged to fly from his kingdom, and he promised to help him. He
  collected a great army, and accompanied by Tarquin and his sons, marched
  towards Rome, hoping to be able to take it at once. This he could not do,
  because the brave Horatius Cocles defended the bridge over the Tiber, and so
  gave the Romans time to cut it down.</p>

  <p>When Porsenna found that he could not take Rome at once as he had hoped,
  he determined to besiege the city, that is, to encamp his army round it, and
  watch it well so that no one could either go in or out, and so that no food
  could be brought in. He also got ships and boats to guard the River Tiber, so
  that no one should get into the town that way.</p>

  <p>Porsenna sent his soldiers all round the city, and they plundered the
  country close to the walls, so that the people were obliged to drive their
  flocks of sheep and herds of cattle inside Rome.</p>

  <p>One day the Consul Valerius ordered that a large flock of sheep should be
  driven out of the town, and the Etruscan soldiers, hearing of this, came
  eagerly to drive them off to their camp. But Valerius laid his plans well,
  for he sent the brave Herminius and Spurius Lartius who had helped Horatius
  to defend the bridge, each with a party of Romans, to hide themselves some
  little way outside the walls. The Etruscans came up and were beginning to
  drive off the sheep, when Valerius had the gates of Rome opened and marched
  out to attack them with a strong party of soldiers. As soon as Herminius
  heard the trumpets, which were the signal that Valerius had begun the fight,
  he led his men out of their hiding place and charged the Etruscans on the
  other side. The Etruscans would now gladly have fled away, but as they tried
  to go towards their camp Spurius Lartius and his troop met them, and so,
  surrounded and overpowered, they were all killed.</p>

  <p>But still the siege went on; and as there was not much food left in the
  city, Porsenna began to hope that the Romans would soon be obliged to
  yield.</p>

  <p>There lived in Rome a young man called Caius Mucius, who thought it was
  shameful that the Roman people should be besieged now that they were
  free.</p>

  <p>"For," said he, "such a thing never happened to the city before, even when
  the kings governed it. And now, are we to be kept prisoners within our walls
  by these Etruscans, whom we have so often beaten in fight?"</p>

  <p>So he resolved that he would try to force his way into Porsenna's camp,
  and do some great deed there. He went to the Senate to ask for leave to go on
  his expedition.</p>

  <p>"Fathers," said he, "I have a great wish to cross the Tiber, and get into
  the enemy's camp if I can; not as a robber, but because I wish to do some
  great deed if the gods will allow me."</p>

  <p>The Senators granted what he asked; and Mucius set off, carrying his sword
  with him hidden under his clothes.</p>

  <p>When he arrived in the camp of the Etruscans he found a great crowd near
  the tent of King Porsenna, for the soldiers were going to receive their pay.
  Mucius saw a man in splendid garments sitting and giving orders; and thinking
  this must be the king, he rushed up to him and stabbed him. But this man was
  not the king, but one of his nobles. Then the Etruscan soldiers seized Mucius
  and dragged him before Porsenna.</p>

  <p>The king asked the young man who he was, and why he had killed the
  Etruscan?</p>

  <p>"I am a Roman," answered Mucius boldly. "My name is Caius Mucius. I wished
  to kill you, King Porsenna, because you are the enemy of Rome; and I am not
  afraid to die since I have not done what I meant to do. A Roman ought to be
  able to do and to bear great things. But I warn you, I am not alone; for I
  have many followers who are resolved to kill you. You must be ready at all
  times to fight for your life; and see that you have armed men always watching
  to guard you. For we, the young men of Rome, declare war against you. Look
  here, and see how little Romans fear pain."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he stretched out his right hand and thrust it into the fire
  that was burning near the king.</p>

  <p>Porsenna was greatly astonished at the bravery of Mucius; he sprang up
  from his throne, and bade his soldiers set the young man free.</p>

  <p>"You have been more cruel to yourself, Mucius, than to me," he said. "I
  set you free. Go home untouched and unharmed by any Etruscan."</p>

  <p>"Since you value courage so much," said Mucius, "I will tell you what your
  threats should never have made me say. Three hundred young Romans have vowed
  to kill you. The first turn was mine; but the rest will come, one after
  another, until one shall succeed in killing you."</p>

  <p>When Porsenna heard this he began to think, though he was a brave man,
  that he certainly would never get back to Clusium, as some one of these
  fierce Romans would be sure to kill him.</p>

  <p>But Mucius went safely back to Rome, and after this time he was always
  called Scævola, which means the left-handed, because his right hand was
  burnt.</p>

  <p>And Porsenna sent ambassadors, or messengers, to Rome to offer to make
  peace with the Romans. He tried to make them promise to let the Tarquins come
  back to Rome; but they would not consent to that. At last Porsenna gave up
  all thoughts of making Tarquin King of Rome again, and he promised to lead
  his army away, if the Romans would give him hostages, that is, would give him
  some of their own people as prisoners; so that he might be quite sure they
  would keep the peace for fear of what he might do to these prisoners. So the
  Romans gave him a number of young boys and girls. Porsenna marched away, but
  pitched his camp again on the banks of the Tiber, not far from Rome.</p>

  <p>One day, when the Roman maidens, who were Porsenna's hostages, were
  walking beside the Tiber, one of them whose name was Cl&oelig;lia thought how
  easy it would be to get across the river away from their enemies, as Horatius
  Cocles had done. She spoke to the other girls and bade them do as she did.
  She then plunged into the water, and swam across. She was soon on the other
  side, followed by her companions, and it was not long before they were all
  once more with their friends in Rome.</p>

  <p>Porsenna was very angry when he heard that the Roman maidens had escaped.
  He sent at once to the consuls, bidding them give him back his hostages, or
  he would not keep the peace. The Romans sent the girls back to him, for they
  wished honourably to keep the promises they had made. Porsenna was so much
  pleased with their honesty, and with the courage of Cl&oelig;lia, that he set
  her free, and allowed her to choose any of her companions whom she wished to
  take back with her to Rome.</p>

  <p>So peace was made again between the Romans and the Etruscans; and the
  Romans so honoured the brave Cl&oelig;lia that they had a statue made of her,
  and placed it in one of the chief streets of Rome, called the Via Sacra,
  which means the Holy Street.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; CAIUS MARCIUS AND HIS MOTHER</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a noble lady in Rome named Volumnia, whose husband
  had died, leaving her with one little son, who was called Caius Marcius.
  Volumnia was a brave and noble woman, and she spent all her time in bringing
  up her son, and in making him what she thought a Roman ought to
  be&mdash;brave and honourable, and able to bear toil and hardship. And Caius
  loved and honoured her, and made her happy by obeying her and trying to
  please her in every way. But he had a proud and haughty temper, and was often
  fierce and even cruel to those whom he did not love. In person he was strong
  and active, and from his childhood he loved to learn the use of weapons. As
  he grew older he practised himself constantly in wrestling, racing, and all
  kinds of manly games, and thus he became so strong and skilful and swift of
  foot that none of the young men of Rome could compare with him.</p>

  <p>When Caius was still very young he went out to war for the first time,
  when Aulus Postumius led the Roman army to fight against the proud King
  Tarquin, and won the great victory at the Lake Regillus. Caius Marcius
  behaved with great bravery in this battle, and after the fight was over the
  general gave him a crown of oak leaves&mdash;the reward usually given to a
  soldier who had saved the life of a Roman. How glad must Marcius have felt
  when he came back to Rome and met his mother's eyes, and knew that she was
  proud of her dear son!</p>

  <p>From this time Marcius was always eager to win fame in war; and he was
  never satisfied with what he had done, but always tried to do more and more
  glorious deeds. He thought himself most happy when he could return to Rome
  after having fought bravely, and bring his spoils and his triumphal garlands
  to his mother, that he might see her joy in his glory.</p>

  <p>Now a war broke out between the Romans and the Volscians, and the Consul
  Cominius led an army against a Volscian town called Corioli, and besieged it.
  Then, leaving part of the army with Titus Lartius, a very brave old officer,
  Cominius went towards Antium, another Volscian town, to meet the Volscian
  army. While he was gone the men of Corioli came out of their town, and
  attacked a party of Romans who were under the command of Marcius. He and his
  soldiers beat back the attack of the Volscians, and drove them into the city.
  Then Marcius cried out,</p>

  <p>"The gates are open for the conquerors as well as for the conquered."</p>

  <p>And, so saying, he with very few following him rushed into Corioli in
  pursuit of the Volscians. In the town he fought with the greatest bravery and
  the Volscians could not drive him out till Lartius and his army came to help
  him, and so the town was taken.</p>

  <p>The Roman soldiers at once began to plunder Corioli; but Marcius told them
  it was shameful for them to be collecting spoil and plundering, when the
  Consul Cominius and his troops were perhaps at that very moment fighting the
  Volscians. He put himself at the head of those who were willing to go with
  him, and got to the place where Cominius was just as the battle was going to
  begin. Marcius begged the consul to let him fight in the place where the
  danger was the greatest; and the consul admiring his courage granted what he
  asked.</p>

  <p>When the battle began, Marcius charged the Volscians with such fury that
  he broke through their ranks, and he was in great danger, and badly wounded,
  but the consul sent his own guards to help him, and the Volscians were put to
  flight. The soldiers then begged Marcius to go to his tent that his wounds
  might be dressed and he might rest himself; but he only said, "It is not for
  conquerors to be tired," and he joined them in pursuing the enemy.</p>

  <p>Next day the consul made a speech to the army, and he praised the gallant
  deeds of Marcius.</p>

  <p>"Of all the plunder that we have gained," he said, "we will give the tenth
  part to Marcius, who has so well deserved it; and I myself wish to give him a
  beautiful horse, to show him how much I admire his valour."</p>

  <p>Marcius came forward before the army to answer the consul.</p>

  <p>"I must refuse the reward you offer me," he said; "I cannot take a bribe
  to pay my sword. I will take my one share like the other soldiers. But your
  horse I will accept&mdash;and besides I will ask a boon. I have a friend
  among the Volscian prisoners, and I would ask for his freedom."</p>

  <p>All the army praised Marcius for his generosity, and the consul said,</p>

  <p>"We will give to Marcius a reward that he cannot refuse; and that is, that
  from this day he shall be called Coriolanus, after the town of Corioli, which
  he won for Rome."</p>

  <p>Soon after this there was a great famine in Rome. During the wars and
  troubles of the last year the land had not been tilled, and the seed corn had
  not been sown; so now very little corn was to be had, and the people could
  hardly get bread to eat. But a great deal of corn was brought from Sicily,
  and the Senate met to talk over the rate at which the people should be
  allowed to buy it&mdash;that is, how much money they must pay for it.</p>

  <p>Now, Caius Marcius&mdash;or Coriolanus, as he must now be
  called&mdash;was, as I told you, a very proud man. He thought because he was
  rich and of a noble family, that he was better than the poor plebeians, as
  the common people of Rome were called, forgetting that a poor man may be as
  good and as brave as a rich one; and that a working man may love his country
  just as well, and be as ready to die to serve it as the greatest noble. He
  wished that the nobles&mdash;the patricians they were called in
  Rome&mdash;should have the power to govern the country as they pleased, and
  that the common people should have no voice in the matter. He was also very
  angry because some time before the Senate had allowed the people to choose
  some men called tribunes, who were to defend any poor man who was in trouble,
  and in all sorts of ways to do all they could to help the plebeians against
  the nobles.</p>

  <p>When the Senate met to fix about selling the Sicilian corn, Coriolanus
  stood up and made a speech to them.</p>

  <p>"If the people," said he, "want this corn to be sold to them as cheaply as
  it used to be, let them give back to the Senate all the power it used to
  possess. Shall we, who could not endure to have the Tarquins ruling over us,
  submit to these low-born tribunes? Let us make the people give them up to us,
  and never have another tribune in Rome. If the people want corn, let them
  steal it, as they did three years ago, if they will not do as the Senate bids
  them."</p>

  <p>When the people heard of what Coriolanus had said, their anger was very
  great.</p>

  <p>"Coriolanus," they cried, "would make us do his will by starving us, the
  people of Rome, as if we were enemies. He will take from us this foreign
  corn, which is our only chance of getting bread for our children, unless we
  give up our tribunes to him. He will either make us slaves, or force us to
  die of hunger."</p>

  <p>They ran to attack Coriolanus, and he might have been killed, but the
  tribunes came between, and ordered him to be tried for what he had said. At
  first he treated the threats of the tribunes with scorn; but the rage of the
  people was so great that the Senate were afraid, and thought it best to
  punish Coriolanus rather than that there should be war in the city. So he was
  tried, and was condemned to be banished, or sent away from Rome for all his
  life. The people were much delighted at this sentence, and the nobles were in
  the greatest distress; so that it was easy to see by men's faces to what
  party they belonged&mdash;he who looked glad and cheerful was a plebeian, and
  he who looked downcast and sad was a patrician.</p>

  <p>Coriolanus himself was the only one who did not show any grief. He was too
  proud to do so. He went home to his own house and bade farewell to his wife
  and mother, who were in the greatest sorrow. He told them they must bear this
  trouble patiently, and then he left them, and went out of the city. He
  resolved that he would go to the country of the Volscians, for his anger was
  so great against the Romans that he hoped to be able to revenge himself on
  them by the help of their old enemies.</p>

  <p>So he came to Antium, where lived Tullus Aufidius, the greatest warrior
  among the Volscians. Coriolanus went into the house of Tullus without anyone
  noticing him, and sat down by the fire, covering his face with his cloak. The
  people of the house were much surprised when they saw him, but so grand and
  noble were his look and manner that they dared not speak to him or ask him
  any questions. At last they went to Tullus himself, who was at supper, to
  tell him about this stranger.</p>

  <p>Tullus rose directly and went to the unknown guest, and asked him who he
  was. Coriolanus stood up, and uncovering his face,</p>

  <p>"I am Caius Marcius," he said, "the man who has done so much to harm the
  Volscians. For all the hard toil and danger that I have gone through I have
  no reward but the name of Coriolanus. The ungrateful and envious people of
  Rome have driven me away from their city. I come to ask if you will let me
  help you to fight against the Romans; for now instead of loving them I hate
  them, and will do my best to punish them, and to fight for you."</p>

  <p>Tullus was greatly pleased to hear what Coriolanus said.</p>

  <p>"Take courage, Marcius," answered he. "We accept your offer of help, and
  you shall find that the Volscians will be more grateful to you than the
  Romans have been."</p>

  <p>And from that day Coriolanus lived in the house of Tullus, and they were
  friends.</p>

  <p>Not long after this there was a quarrel between the Volscians and the
  Romans, and the Volscians chose Coriolanus and Tullus for their generals. It
  was agreed that Coriolanus should lead an army of Volscians to attack the
  Romans at once, and that Tullus should remain behind, to collect fresh
  troops, and to see that the Volscian towns were properly defended.</p>

  <p>The Volscians were greatly pleased with the courage and warlike skill of
  their new general; and they praised him so often and so much, that Tullus
  began to think that all his own deeds would be forgotten, and he grew jealous
  of Coriolanus, and wished that he had never helped him to make friends with
  the Volscians.</p>

  <p>News was brought to Rome that the banished Coriolanus, at the head of a
  large Volscian army, was marching to attack them, and soon they heard of his
  taking one town after another that lay between Rome and the country of the
  Volscians. At last he arrived at a place only five miles from Rome, and then
  all the people were in the greatest terror. The women ran up and down the
  streets in their fear, the old men were seen weeping and praying before the
  altars of the gods, and the whole city was filled with confusion and
  alarm.</p>

  <p>The people and Senate agreed to send messengers to Coriolanus to beg him
  to put an end to the war, and to ask him to come home and be a Roman once
  more. So they chose for messengers men who were all friends or relations of
  Coriolanus, supposing that he would treat with respect and kindness those
  whom he had loved before he was banished. But when the messengers came to the
  Volscian camp, they were led before Coriolanus, who was seated in state, with
  his chief officers about him. He received them with a very severe manner, and
  as if they had been all strangers to him. He told them that the Romans must
  give back to the Volscians all the lands they had taken from them in former
  wars.</p>

  <p>"If you do not do this," said he, "you shall have no peace."</p>

  <p>So the messengers went back to Rome, sad at heart, to tell the people of
  these hard terms. The Romans in great fear sent the messengers back again to
  Coriolanus, but he refused to let them come into his camp. After this the
  priests in their robes went to try if they could persuade him to show mercy,
  but they could not alter his resolve. He told them that the Romans must
  either give up their lands, as he had said, or fight.</p>

  <p>Now when the Romans had almost lost the hope of being able to defend
  themselves against their terrible enemy, some of the Roman ladies went to
  Volumnia, the mother of Coriolanus, to ask her and his wife, Virgilia, to go
  to him, and to beg him to spare the city. When the ladies had spoken,
  Volumnia said,</p>

  <p>"All the Romans are unhappy, but we are more unhappy than all. For we see
  my son, Virgilia's husband, fighting against his own country. I know not if
  he have any love for us left, as he has none for his country, which used to
  be dearer to him than mother, wife, or children. But we will go to him if you
  wish it. If he will not listen to us, we can at least die at his feet begging
  him to have mercy on Rome."</p>

  <p>So Volumnia and Virgilia took the two little sons of Coriolanus with them,
  and went with the other women to the Volscian camp.</p>

  <p>When they got there the soldiers allowed them to pass through it, till
  they came to where Coriolanus was sitting among his chief officers. The
  general, who had resisted the prayers of his dearest friends, and of the
  priests who begged him in the name of the gods to spare Rome, was not
  inclined to pay any attention to a band of sorrowing women; but one of his
  attendants cried out suddenly,</p>

  <p>"If my eyes do not deceive me, general, yonder stand your mother and your
  wife and children!"</p>

  <p>Coriolanus was greatly surprised; he sprang from his seat, and ran to
  embrace his mother. But when he came near her she bade him stop.</p>

  <p>"Before you embrace me," she said, "let me know if I am come to my son or
  to an enemy&mdash;if I am your mother or a prisoner in your camp. Has my life
  lasted so many years only that I should see you first banished, and now the
  enemy of Rome? Could you plunder the country in which you were born, and
  which has fed you for so many years? Did not your anger grow less when you
  came into these parts? Did not you think, when you came in sight of Rome,
  'Within those walls is my home; there are my mother, wife, and children?' If
  you had not been born Rome would not have been attacked. If I had never had a
  son I might have died a free woman in a free country. Now what I suffer is
  shameful to you and most sad to me; yet, however miserable you make me, it
  cannot be for long, for if you go on to conquer Rome, you must pass over the
  dead body of your mother."</p>

  <p>Then she and his wife and children threw themselves on their knees at his
  feet, and begged him to have mercy on Rome. Coriolanus was shocked to see his
  mother kneeling before him.</p>

  <p>"O mother," he said as he raised her up, "what have you done? You have
  gained a great victory for Rome, but it will be ruinous to me. I go,
  conquered by you alone."</p>

  <p>So he sent the ladies back to Rome, and next morning he led the Volscian
  army away to Antium.</p>

  <p>Some of the Volscians were very angry with Coriolanus because he had not
  gone on and conquered Rome, and among these was Tullus Aufidius. Tullus was
  also jealous of Coriolanus, because his great courage and skill in war had
  made the Volscians think more of him than they did of Tullus.</p>

  <p>Tullus therefore resolved to kill Coriolanus, and collected a number of
  his friends who agreed to help him. They called on Coriolanus to give an
  account of what he had done before Rome to the people of Antium; and when he
  stood up to speak, they cried out that a traitor ought not to be heard,
  rushed on him, and stabbed him. So he died; but the Volscians gave him an
  honourable funeral, and raised a monument to his memory.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE DEEDS OF THE FABII</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was in Rome a great family of nobles called the Fabii.
  There were a great many of them, brothers, cousins, and other relations, and
  they were brave men and good soldiers, but proud to the people. So the
  commons hated them, and were very angry because the nobles year after year
  got one or another Fabius made consul. The people thought that one of these
  men, Quintus Fabius, had not divided fairly the plunder that had been taken
  in war from the Volscians, and for this they hated the Fabii more than ever;
  and they hated the nobles too, for so often making Fabii their consuls.</p>

  <p>These quarrels grew so violent that one year when Kæso Fabius was consul,
  and led the army against the Veientians, the soldiers would not fight. Fabius
  had more trouble with his own soldiers than with the enemy. He was a good
  general and drew up his troops in order of battle; but when he commanded them
  to charge, the foot-soldiers would not move; they hated the consul so much
  that they felt they would rather bear the disgrace of being beaten than help
  to win a victory for him. The horse-soldiers, however, who were rich men and
  did not belong to the common people, and did not hate the Fabii, charged the
  Veientians, and defeated them without the help of the foot.</p>

  <p>The nobles still would not do as the people wished, and the next year they
  chose Marcus Fabius, Kæso's brother, for one consul, and Cnæus Manlius for
  the other.</p>

  <p>The Etruscans were very glad when they knew how the Romans were
  quarrelling among themselves; for now they thought Rome might be conquered,
  as its own people would not fight to defend it. The Roman consuls were more
  afraid of their own soldiers than of the enemy, and they thought the best
  thing they could do was to shut themselves up in their camp, hoping that the
  soldiers would after a time change their minds and wish to fight. The
  Etruscans used to ride up to the gates of the camp, and challenge the Romans
  to come out and fight them. Sometimes they would tell them that they only
  pretended to quarrel because they were cowards and dared not fight. Sometimes
  they would say that the consuls would not let them fight, because they knew
  the Romans would be sure to be beaten.</p>

  <p>The consuls did not care or take much notice of the taunts of the enemy;
  but the soldiers could not bear them so well. Their hearts were filled with
  shame and anger; and at last they crowded to the consuls' tent begging them
  to give the signal for battle. The consuls were glad enough to see the change
  in their men, but they would not yet yield. They wished to fight, but they
  thought if the soldiers were kept still a little longer in the camp that they
  would grow more and more eager for battle. So they spoke to the soldiers, and
  told them that the time for attacking the enemy was not yet come, but that
  they would stay in the camp.</p>

  <p>The soldiers went away from the consuls, thinking that they were not to be
  allowed to fight, and wishing to do so more than ever. The enemy too, hearing
  that the consuls would not fight, came up to the gates of the camp and mocked
  and insulted the Romans, saying that they were not to be trusted with their
  arms, lest they should use them against their own generals. The Romans could
  bear it no longer, and ran in crowds to the consuls, demanding with shouts
  and cries to be led to battle.</p>

  <p>Marcus Fabius, having talked with Manlius, the other consul, commanded the
  soldiers to be silent, and then said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I know, Manlius, that these men can win the battle if they choose, but I
  know not whether they really mean to win it. So I have resolved not to give
  the signal for battle unless they swear that they will come back conquerors.
  For they will not dare to disappoint the gods."</p>

  <p>One of the centurions (or officers), called Flavoleius, came forward, and
  said, "Fabius, I swear that I will come back a conqueror from the fight. If I
  do not, may the gods punish me."</p>

  <p>All the rest of the soldiers made the same promise, and when this was done
  Fabius gave the signal, and the army marched out of the camp, full of hope
  and shouting to the Etruscans&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Now let us see if you dare call us cowards again."</p>

  <p>The Etruscans were eager for battle, thinking that the Romans would not
  really fight. But they soon found that they were mistaken, for they had
  hardly time to get into order, before the Romans rushed upon them, sword in
  hand. The people and the nobles all fought well that day, but the Fabii
  fought best of all, and gave a noble example for their countrymen to follow.
  One of them, Quintus Fabius, was in front of the Roman army, and he attacked
  the enemy so fiercely that he was separated from his own men, and surrounded
  by his foes. An Etruscan stabbed him with his spear, and he sunk down and
  died. The fall of this brave man made the Romans stop and then begin to go
  back; but Marcus Fabius, the consul, stepped across his brother's body and
  cried out to the soldiers&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Was this what you promised me, fellow-soldiers? Did you swear that you
  would come back beaten to the camp? I made no promise; but now I swear I will
  either win the battle, or else die at your side, dear Quintus Fabius."</p>

  <p>Then Kæso Fabius, who had been consul the year before, stepped up to the
  side of Marcus.</p>

  <p>"Think you, brother," said he, "that you can make these men fight by
  talking to them? Instead of telling them, let us show them what to do, as is
  fitting for brave men, and men of the Fabian race."</p>

  <p>When he had said these words the two Fabii at once attacked the enemy, and
  they were followed by the whole army.</p>

  <p>Meantime, Manlius the other consul had been so badly wounded in another
  part of the battle, that he was obliged to go out of the fight, that his
  wounds might be bound up. This made his soldiers lose heart; they thought he
  was killed and were beginning to give way, when the Consul Fabius rode up to
  them with some of his horse soldiers, and called to them that he had
  conquered the other wing of the Etruscans, and that Manlius was not dead but
  only wounded. This cheered them, and soon after, to their great joy, Manlius
  came back to the battle. Meantime the Etruscans, who were many more in
  numbers than the Romans, sent a body of troops to attack the Roman camp,
  which they did so fiercely that they broke into it though the Roman guards
  defended it bravely.</p>

  <p>News was brought to Manlius of what had happened, and he immediately came
  to the camp and set a guard of soldiers at each gate to prevent the enemy
  getting out. They tried hard to break through, and in the fight Manlius was
  killed. The Etruscans managed to get through the gate, but as they marched
  away they were met by the Consul Fabius and his conquering army, and many of
  them were killed and the rest put to flight. Thus the Romans had gained a
  splendid victory, though it was saddened by the deaths of Quintus Fabius, and
  of the Consul Manlius.</p>

  <p>The Senate were very glad to hear of the battle being won, and they sent
  word to Marcus Fabius that he should enter the city in triumph with his army.
  But Fabius answered,</p>

  <p>"My family are all in tears and grief for the death of my brother Quintus,
  and Rome is mourning for her consul. So I will not wear the laurel wreath,
  nor come home in triumph."</p>

  <p>This refusal of Fabius was thought by the people more glorious than any
  triumph could have been. Splendid funerals were made for the two dead chiefs,
  and Fabius made speeches at the graves and gave them the praise that they
  deserved for so bravely dying for Rome.</p>

  <p>Fabius did not forget that he had determined when he was first made consul
  to make the people friends again with the nobles. One of the things he did to
  bring this about was to plan that the nobles should give money to feed and
  clothe the poor soldiers who had been badly wounded in the war. And none of
  these soldiers were better taken care of than those who were the charge of
  the Fabian family. By these and other brave and kind deeds the Fabii made the
  people love them and forget their old dislike.</p>

  <p>Soon afterwards new wars began with several peoples round Rome; but the
  most troublesome enemies of all were the Veientians. Then the Fabian family
  went to the Senate, and Kæso, who was consul again that year, spoke for all
  the rest.</p>

  <p>"Fathers," he said, "it is well known to you that to fight the Veientians,
  a small number of soldiers always ready would be more useful than a larger
  number who would only be sometimes watching them. Do you attend to the other
  wars, but give the war against Veii to the care of the Fabian family. We
  promise you that we will not disgrace the name of Rome, and we will pay the
  cost of the war ourselves."</p>

  <p>The Senate thanked the brave Fabii, and the consul with his family
  returned to their homes. Next day all the Fabii armed themselves, and met
  together in front of the consul's house. The consul saw all his family drawn
  up in order of battle, and he went out clad in his armour, and joined them.
  He gave the signal to start, and they all, three hundred and six in number,
  all nobles, all of one family, and each man fit to be a general, marched
  through the city to the gate nearest to Veii. They were followed by crowds of
  people praising them, admiring them, and bidding them go on bravely and fight
  successfully. So the Fabii left Rome, and marched on till they came to the
  River Cremera, where they built themselves a strong fort or castle, and there
  they watched the Veientians. They were so strong and brave that they kept
  their fort safe, and defended the country which borders on Etruria, and
  troubled the Etruscans greatly for some time.</p>

  <p>The Etruscans got together an army and attacked the castle, but the Romans
  sallied out and drove off the enemy, and afterwards defeated them in several
  other battles.</p>

  <p>The Etruscans began to think that they could never conquer these fierce
  Fabii in open fight, so they made a plan to attack them unexpectedly. A
  number of Etruscan soldiers hid themselves not far from the castle. Then some
  others drove a flock of sheep out on to the plain further away from it. When
  the Fabii saw the sheep they went out to catch them, and in doing so they
  passed the place where the Etruscans were hidden. Then they scattered
  themselves about the plain in pursuit of the sheep, and suddenly met some
  Etruscan troops who had been sent to attack them. At the same time the
  Etruscans who had been hidden rushed upon them from behind, so that they were
  quite surrounded. The Fabii fought nobly, as you may fancy from what you have
  heard of their deeds; but they were few and the Etruscans were many, and they
  were killed, every one of them, except one young boy.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; CINCINNATUS</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a people near Rome named the Æqui, who were at one
  time friends and allies of the Romans. But they broke the treaty of peace
  they had made with Rome, and marched an army towards Tusculum. They burnt the
  villages, and plundered the people, and then pitched their camp on Mount
  Algidus. The Romans sent ambassadors to the camp of the Æqui, to complain of
  their having broken the treaty, and to ask that all the plunder should be
  given back to the people to whom it belonged.</p>

  <p>The general of the Æqui only laughed at the Roman ambassadors, and bade
  them tell the message of the Senate to a great oak tree which grew near the
  camp, and not to him. The ambassadors were very angry at this, and called
  upon the gods to punish the Æqui, who had so broken their promises of
  friendship.</p>

  <p>When the Senate heard of the way in which their messengers had been
  treated, they collected an army, and sent it against the Æqui, under the
  command of one of the consuls, Minucius. Unfortunately Minucius was a timid
  man, and though he marched towards Algidus, and pitched his camp not far from
  that of the Æqui, he was afraid to fight a battle with them. The Æqui soon
  found out that the Roman general was afraid of them, and they grew bold, and
  attacked the Roman camp. Although they could not take it by storm, they dug
  ditches, and built mounds all round it, so that the Roman army was closely
  shut up, and could not get out. But before he was quite shut up, Minucius
  sent five soldiers out of his camp. These men managed to get through the
  enemy's guards, and made all the haste they could to Rome.</p>

  <p>They went at once to the Senate, and told them that the consul and his
  army were besieged in their camp by the Æqui. Great was the sorrow in Rome
  when this bad news was heard. The Senate resolved to choose a dictator, and
  no man seemed to them so fit for their chief as Lucius Quintius
  Cincinnatus.</p>

  <p>A dictator of Rome was like a king in most ways. He could do what he
  pleased, and all men were bound to obey him&mdash;but this only lasted for
  six months. After that time he was no longer dictator, and he could be
  punished if he had done any wrong in his time of power.</p>

  <p>Messengers were sent at once to tell Cincinnatus what was fixed. He did
  not live in Rome, but in a little cottage outside the walls where he had a
  small piece of land; for though he was of noble family he was a very poor
  man. The messengers found him hard at work, ploughing his little field. When
  they had greeted him, they bade him "put on his gown and hear what message
  the Senate sent him."</p>

  <p>Cincinnatus was greatly surprised, and asked if all were well at Rome.
  Then he called to his wife Racilia to fetch him his gown out of the cottage,
  and having washed himself and put it on, he stood before the messengers. They
  told him that he was chosen to be dictator, and wished him joy.</p>

  <p>"You must come at once to Rome," they said. "You are much wanted there,
  for the Consul Minucius and his troops are besieged in their camp by the
  Æqui, and you must lead an army to set them free."</p>

  <p>So Cincinnatus went to Rome. His relations and friends and most of the
  senators came to the gates to meet him, and led him into the town. Next day
  he came into the Forum or market place before it was light. He chose for his
  Master of the Knights, Lucius Tarquitius, who was said to be the bravest of
  all the young men in Rome. Then he commanded that the shops should be shut,
  and that no work should be done in the town; but that all men who were of fit
  age to fight should come together before sunset in a field close to the walls
  called the Campus Martius, or Field of Mars. Each man was to bring with him
  his arms, food for five days, and twelve wooden stakes. The men who were too
  old or not strong enough to fight, were to collect the food for the
  soldiers.</p>

  <p>All was done as the dictator ordered, and when the soldiers were met
  together, he came to them and spoke to them in these words&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Soldiers, we must make all the haste we can, that we may attack the enemy
  this very night. For the consul and his army have been besieged for three
  days, and we know not what may happen. Make haste, standard-bearer. March on,
  soldiers!"</p>

  <p>The troops were eager to obey, and shouted as their general had
  done,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Make haste, standard-bearer. March on, soldiers!"</p>

  <p>So they departed from Rome, and in the middle of the night they got to
  Mount Algidus, where the consul was still surrounded by the army of the
  Æqui.</p>

  <p>Then Cincinnatus rode all round the enemy's camp to see, as well as he
  could in the night-time, how it was placed. Next he drew all his army in a
  long train quite round the camp, and commanded that when he gave a signal
  each man should shout as loud as he could, and then set to work to make a
  ditch in front of himself, and set up his twelve stakes as a paling to defend
  it. When all was ready the dictator gave the signal, and the Romans shouted
  so loud that the noise they made was heard not only in the enemy's camp, but
  by the Consul Minucius and his soldiers. Glad enough were the imprisoned army
  to hear the shouts of their countrymen and to find that help was so near.
  Minucius called his men together&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Let us lose no time," he cried; "these shouts not only tell us that our
  friends have come to help us; they show that the Romans have already begun
  the battle. Stand to your arms, then, and follow me."</p>

  <p>By this time the Æqui were doing their best to stop the soldiers of
  Cincinnatus from fencing them in; but while they were fighting the dictator's
  men on one side, they were attacked on the other by Minucius and his
  followers, who now rushed out of their camp, eager to set themselves free. So
  the Æqui were between two Roman armies. They fought well, and the battle went
  on all night, but when day came they were forced to yield and to beg for
  peace from Cincinnatus.</p>

  <p>The camp of the Æqui was full of provisions and spoil, and the Romans took
  possession of it when the battle was over. But Cincinnatus gave all the
  plunder to the soldiers of his own army, for he was still angry with the
  consul and his troops.</p>

  <p>"You soldiers," he said to them, "were very nearly made prisoners
  yourselves, and the spoils of the enemy are not for you. And you, Minucius,
  shall only command your army under my orders, till you have learned to be as
  brave as a consul ought to be."</p>

  <p>So Minucius had to give up being consul, but stayed with the army as the
  dictator had commanded.</p>

  <p>Although Cincinnatus was a severe general, he was so brave a man and so
  good a soldier that the army loved and admired him, and to show him their
  gratitude for his having saved them they presented him with a golden
  crown.</p>

  <p>When he came back to Rome he was met with great joy by the people and
  entered the city in triumph. He then gave up his power, after having been
  dictator for only sixteen days.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE BATTLE OF CORBIO</h2>

  <p class="first">SOME years after the victory of Cincinnatus when Titus
  Quintius Capitolinus was consul for the fourth time, the Volscians and the
  Æqui again attacked Rome. They thought they could do so safely, because there
  were great quarrels in the city, between the nobles and the common people.
  They first attacked the Latins, who were now friends with the Romans, and
  then, finding that no army was sent to meet them, they marched on, plundering
  the country as they went, till they came up to the walls of Rome. Then having
  shown the Romans how little they feared them, and having collected a great
  deal of plunder, they marched away to Corbio.</p>

  <p>Then the Consul Quintius called the people together, and spoke to them in
  these words&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I come before you to-day, Romans, with the greatest shame that could be.
  You know, and our children's children will hear, that the Volscians and Æqui
  came in arms before the walls of Rome, and that no sword was drawn to resist
  them, in the year when Titus Quintius was consul. Had I known that such shame
  would have come upon me, I would rather have died or have been banished, than
  have been made consul. Which did our enemies think the most lazy and
  cowardly? Us consuls, or you Romans? If the fault is ours, let us be no
  longer consuls, or if that is not enough, punish us in what way you like. But
  if the fault is yours, O Romans, I would have you repent of your wrong doing,
  and I pray that neither gods nor men may punish you for it.</p>

  <p>"Your enemies did not trust in your sloth, nor in their own courage, for
  you have beaten them so often in battle, that by this time they know both
  themselves and you. But the quarrels between the nobles and the commons are
  the ruin of Rome. What would you have? You wished for tribunes, and we
  granted them to you. We punished by death or banishment the noblest men of
  the city, because you were displeased with them. What will be the end of
  these quarrels? When shall we have peace within our walls? It is only against
  us nobles that you take up arms, not against the enemies of your country.</p>

  <p>"But let me ask you to go out of the gates of the town, or, if you dare
  not do that, to look from the city walls into the fields. See how they are
  laid waste by fire and sword, the cattle driven away, and the houses smoking.
  The country is desolate, the city is besieged, and the glory of the war is
  with our enemies. What have you at home to make up for such losses as these?
  The tribunes will give you plenty of talk and words; but which of you ever
  took home to his wife and children, anything but quarrels and hatreds from
  these struggles in the city?</p>

  <p>"But when you were soldiers under me, not under the tribunes&mdash;when
  you were in the camp, not in the Forum&mdash;when the enemy in the
  battle-field, not the Roman nobles in the Senate, heard and feared your
  shouts&mdash;then did you not return to your homes in triumph, loaded with
  riches, and crowned with glory? Stay here in the city if you please; but if
  you do not go to fight your enemies, they will come before long, to fight you
  here; they will scale the walls, mount the Capitol, nay, pursue you into your
  own homes.</p>

  <p>"I know I might say many things that would please you better than this.
  And truly I would gladly please you, Romans; but yet I would much rather save
  you, whatever you may think of me hereafter. Oh, if you will but give up
  these quarrels, and do as your fathers would have done, I will bear any
  punishment you please, if I do not in a few days drive these plunderers of
  our country out of their camp, and carry the war from our walls to their
  cities."</p>

  <p>Never were the people more delighted with any speech than with this one of
  the consul, and they were eager for war. The army was ordered to meet next
  morning in the Field of Mars; the standards were brought out from the temple
  where they were kept in time of peace, and given to the soldiers; and the
  army with the two consuls at its head marched away from Rome. The next
  evening they pitched their camp near to that of the enemy near Corbio.</p>

  <p>Now though there were two consuls, one of them, whose name was Agrippa
  Furius, thought that it would be much better that the army should be governed
  by one man; so he told the other consul, Quintius, that he would obey him in
  everything, and would do whatever Quintius thought best. Quintius was much
  pleased, and he praised Agrippa for caring more that the war should be well
  managed than that he himself should manage it.</p>

  <p>When the Roman army was drawn up in line of battle, Quintius made Agrippa
  the leader of the left wing, that is, of the soldiers who fought on the left
  side of the army, and he himself led the right wing. The middle part of the
  army, the centre as it was called, was commanded by Spurius Postumius. The
  battle began, and the centre and right wing of the Roman army fought bravely,
  and though the Volscians and Æqui resisted stoutly, yet the Romans began to
  get the better of them. Meantime the Roman cavalry, or horse soldiers,
  attacked the enemy's cavalry and defeated them and killed a great many. When
  they had done so they charged the rest of the Volscian army, by which they
  greatly helped their countrymen, and the enemy who were already beginning to
  give way were put in disorder, and yielded to Quintius.</p>

  <p>But the left wing of the Roman army was in great trouble, for they could
  not conquer the part of the enemy's army which was opposed to them. Then the
  Consul Agrippa, who was a very strong man, seized the standards from the
  soldiers who carried them, and going up in front of the enemy, he flung the
  standards with all his force into the middle of them. The Romans would have
  felt it a terrible disgrace if they had lost their standards, and rushed
  forward so eagerly to win them back that they broke the ranks of the Æqui,
  and so the battle was won.</p>

  <p>Just at this moment there came a messenger from Quintius to tell them that
  he was victorious, and just going to enter the enemy's camp; but that he
  waited to know if Agrippa had conquered too. If so, Agrippa was to come to
  Quintius at once, so that the whole army might join in winning the spoils of
  the enemy. Agrippa did as he was commanded, and after taking the camp, where
  they found great quantities of rich spoil as well as the plunder which had
  been taken from their own country, Quintius and he led their army back to
  Rome.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>X. &mdash; HOW THE ROMANS WON TWO CITIES</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a town called Veii, which was on the border of
  Tuscany, some miles from Rome. The people of Veii, who were called
  Veientians, had often fought against the Romans; their town was as large and
  rich as Rome, and they boasted that their courage and skill in war were as
  great as those of the Romans. The quarrel between the two towns was so
  fierce, that it could plainly be seen that whichever people was conquered,
  would be destroyed by the other&mdash;so that there must either be no Romans,
  or else no Veientians left.</p>

  <p>There were many battles fought, and on the whole the Romans got the best
  of the fighting. But the Veientians were many and brave; they built strong
  and high walls round their city, got together plenty of food and arms, and so
  waited without fear for the coming of their enemies.</p>

  <p>The Romans heard how strongly Veii was defended; they knew how difficult
  it would be to take the town, and how many of their brave soldiers would be
  killed if they tried to do so. So they determined to blockade the city, that
  is, to encamp their army round the town, and watch it well, so that none of
  the Veientians could get out, and so that no one could bring them food or
  help. They hoped that when all the food was eaten, and the Veientians were
  tired of being shut up inside their walls, they would yield, and give up
  their town.</p>

  <p>The Roman army marched to Veii, and while the summer lasted it was
  pleasant enough for the soldiers to live in their tents in the warm sunny
  air. But when the winter came, and the weather grew cold and stormy, the
  Roman leaders made their men build huts and little houses where they might
  all be sheltered.</p>

  <p>Now, before this time, the Romans were used to make war only in the
  summer, and they were very angry at being kept away from their homes and
  wives and children for so long. They said that never, even in the old times
  when they were governed by the kings, had they been obliged to make war in
  the winter.</p>

  <p>The people of Rome wished to order the army to come home; but Appius
  Claudius, one of the senators, made a speech to them and persuaded them not
  to do so.</p>

  <p>"If you call your army back from Rome now," said he, "the Veientians will
  immediately come out of their city, and will attack us and plunder our
  cornfields and vineyards, and burn our cottages and our orchards; and then
  our work will all have to be done over again next year. For we must conquer
  the Veientians, or else they will destroy Rome."</p>

  <p>In this way he persuaded the people to let the army stay on at Veii. But
  the siege went on year after year, and still the Veientians would not yield
  up the town, and still the Romans would not go to their homes, but watched
  and waited.</p>

  <p>In the seventh year after the siege was begun a strange thing happened.
  There was a lake among the hills, some miles from Rome, called the Alban
  Lake. Most lakes have rivers running through them; but the Alban Lake had no
  stream either flowing into it at one end, or out it at the other. The water
  in the lake began in this year to rise higher, nobody knew why; and at last
  it rose so high that it overflowed, and the water ran down the hills across
  the country towards the sea. This curious thing was very much talked of in
  all the country round, and in the Roman camp, so that at last it was heard of
  by the besieged Veientians,&mdash;for the soldiers of the two armies would
  sometimes talk together, as often happens in long sieges.</p>

  <p>A Roman soldier was one day talking to an old Veientian, who seemed to be
  very much pleased when he heard the strange story of the Alban Lake.</p>

  <p>"For," said he, "we have an old saying or prophecy in our town, that the
  Romans will never take Veii if the water of the Alban Lake gets down to the
  sea."</p>

  <p>The Roman was very much surprised to hear this; and he pretended he wanted
  to ask some other questions of the old Veientian, who was said by his
  townsmen to be a prophet who could tell beforehand what was going to happen.
  So it was agreed that they should meet one another between the town and the
  camp without their weapons. When the time came, they met as had been fixed;
  but then the strong young Roman threw his arms round the old man, and in
  spite of all his struggles carried him off to the camp and took him before
  the Roman general, who sent him to Rome. There he was taken before the
  Senate, the assembly of nobles who governed Rome, who asked him what was the
  meaning of his strange words.</p>

  <p>"It is written in some of our old books at Veii," answered the man, "that
  if the Romans make a new channel for the waters of the Alban Lake when they
  overflow, they shall conquer Veii; but they are doing nothing."</p>

  <p>The Senate then determined to send messengers to the temple of Apollo at
  Delphi, to ask the god what they must do. The messengers, when they returned,
  brought word that the water must not be allowed to flow away into the sea,
  but that the Romans must dig ditches and canals for it to run in, till it had
  all run away in watering the land. This was done, but still the siege of Veii
  went on.</p>

  <p>In the tenth year of the siege, the Senate determined to change the
  generals, and they made Marcus Furius Camillus dictator. Camillus was well
  known to the Romans as being a brave and successful soldier, and the army
  were very glad to hear that he was to be their new leader. But before he
  joined the army at Veii, he got together a large body of fresh troops, and
  led them out to meet the people of Falerii, another town near Rome, who had
  attacked the Roman lands, hoping to do so safely while the Romans were busy
  fighting the Veientians. Camillus defeated the Falerians in a great battle,
  and drove them out of their camp, after which he led his army to Veii.</p>

  <p>Soon after he got there, he ordered his soldiers to make a mine into the
  town. A mine is a passage underground, which the soldiers of a besieging army
  dig so deep that it goes quite under the walls, and comes up inside the town.
  Camillus made his soldiers work by turns, so that day and night there were
  always some of them digging at the mine, and there were fresh men to take
  their places as soon as they got tired, so that none of them need do too
  much. In this way the work was carried on quickly; and the Veientians knew
  nothing about it, and had no idea that the Romans were digging a passage
  under their walls.</p>

  <p>When the mine was ready, Camillus, with part of his army, made an attack
  on the outside of the city, and the Veientians ran to defend their walls.
  Meantime the king and the priests were offering sacrifices to the gods in the
  temple of Juno.</p>

  <p>Now it happened that the underground passage had been dug so far, that the
  end of it was just under the pavement of the temple of Juno, and the Romans
  in the passage could hear all that was going on in the temple, and they heard
  the priest say&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The gods promise victory to whoever shall offer this animal to them."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this the Roman soldiers broke through the pavement, rushed up
  into the temple, and offered the sacrifice to the goddess, while the
  Veientians, astonished and frightened by their shouts and the clashing of
  their armour, fled away. Some of the Romans pursued them, and others ran to
  open the gates to Camillus and the rest of the army; soon the city was filled
  with the Romans, and there was fighting in every part of it. Camillus told
  his officers to forbid the soldiers to hurt the women and children; but he
  let them plunder the town.</p>

  <p>Then Camillus resolved that he would take the statue of Juno, the
  protector of Veii, to Rome. He chose out a number of young men from the army,
  and bade them wash themselves and dress in white garments, and then he went
  with them to the temple, and sacrificed to the goddess.</p>

  <p>"O Juno," said he, "we pray thee to accept our service, and to go with us
  and live among the gods of Rome."</p>

  <p>It is said that the statue gently answered him, that she was willing and
  ready to go. So they carried her to Rome, and Camillus built a stately temple
  for her on Mount Aventine.</p>

  <p>Not long after the taking of Veii, the Romans gave Camillus the command of
  an army, which he was to lead against his old enemies the Falerians. He soon
  entered their country, and so much did they fear him, remembering how he had
  before defeated them, that they shut themselves up in their town of Falerii,
  which was built among rocky hills, and defended with strong walls. But when
  they saw the Romans marching over their lands, burning their villages and
  wasting their fields, they could bear it no longer. They came out of the town
  and pitched their camp among the rough rocks not far from the gates. Camillus
  was glad to be able to fight them, and one night he marched his army to their
  camp, so that at break of day the Falerians saw their enemies close upon
  them. The Romans attacked them fiercely, and the Falerians fled out of their
  camp and ran as fast as they could to the shelter of their city; but many
  were killed and wounded before they could reach the gates.</p>

  <p>Camillus resolved to besiege the town; but it was well defended and
  strong, and the Falerians had collected plenty of corn and food and arms, so
  that the siege might have lasted as long as the siege of Veii, if a strange
  thing had not happened.</p>

  <p>The Falerians felt so sure that the Romans could not break through their
  strong walls, that everything went on in the town just as if there had been
  no army encamped before it. The people went about their business or
  amusement, and the children went to school as usual. There was one
  schoolmaster in Falerii who taught the sons of most of the nobles of the
  town, and he used in time of peace to take the boys for walks and games
  outside the walls. After the siege began he still took the boys as usual just
  outside the gates of the town, and the Roman soldiers never took any notice
  of this; so the schoolmaster made a wicked plan. Every day he led the boys a
  little further and a little further from the town, keeping them amused with
  talk or play, so that they should not see what he meant to do. At last one
  day he took them further than ever, and right among the Roman soldiers. He
  bade the soldiers take him to Camillus, and he and the children were led into
  the general's tent.</p>

  <p>"See here, general," he said. "See these children. In giving them to you I
  am giving Falerii to you, for these are the sons of the greatest and noblest
  men of town, who will do whatever you please in order to save their sons out
  of your hands."</p>

  <p>Camillus listened to the schoolmaster till he had done speaking, and then
  he said:</p>

  <p>"Thou art come, thou base fellow, with thy hateful present to a people and
  a general who are very different from thyself. We have never been allies of
  the Falerians, but we do not forget that we are men as well as they are; and
  that it is right to be just as well as brave. We do not draw our swords
  against children, but against soldiers. Thou hast tried to conquer Falerii by
  such a wicked deed as was never seen before; I will conquer by the help of
  the good swords and brave hearts of my Romans. Here, lictors, strip off this
  villain's clothes, bind his hands behind his back; give your rods to the
  boys, and let them flog him back to the gates of Falerii."</p>

  <p>In the meantime the people of Falerii had found out what had happened. The
  city was filled with cries of grief, and the fathers and mothers of the boys
  ran to the walls or gates not knowing what to do, and fearing that they had
  lost their dear children for ever. While they were in this state of grief,
  what was their surprise and joy to see their boys coming over from the Roman
  camp driving their wicked master before them. The Falerians were so much
  moved by the generous conduct of Camillus, that they resolved to give up
  their town and to make peace. They sent messengers to Camillus, who bade them
  go on to the Senate at Rome, to whom they gave this message.</p>

  <p>"We men of Falerii give ourselves up to you, O Senators, because we see
  that the Romans love justice better than victory. We think that we shall be
  better governed by you than by our own laws; nor shall you ever repent of
  your generosity, nor we of being under your government."</p>

  <p>Both friends and enemies thanked Camillus for what he had done, peace was
  made, and the army came back to Rome.</p>

  <p>These great victories made Camillus very proud, and many men in Rome began
  to envy him, and to think that he was growing too great. And after many
  quarrels they persuaded the Senate to banish Camillus from Rome.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE TAKING OF ROME</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the northern part of Italy there lived at this time a
  people called the Gauls. They were of the same race as the Scotch
  Highlanders, who are still sometimes called Gaels, and were a fierce and
  savage people who loved fighting. They are described to us as tall strong men
  with fair hair, who wore dresses of many colours, like the Scotch plaids, and
  were armed with shields and long broad-swords. It was many years before the
  time of which I am now telling you that the Gauls had first crossed the Alps,
  and settled in Northern Italy; but they now began to march further south, and
  attacked Clusium.</p>

  <p>The people of Clusium sent to Rome to beg for help. The Senate refused to
  send an army to their aid, but chose three young nobles of the family of
  Fabius, as ambassadors to go to the Gauls, to try and make peace.</p>

  <p>When the three Fabii arrived in the Gaulish camp they were led before the
  king, and spoke to him thus:</p>

  <p>"The Roman Senate, O king, would have you put an end to the war against
  the Clusians who have never injured you. If it should be needful, know that
  the Romans will fight with you to defend their friends and allies; but they
  will gladly be at peace with you if you will stop fighting."</p>

  <p>"We will make peace with the Clusians," answered the Gaulish king, "if
  they will give up to us a part of their lands. If not, we will fight them in
  your presence, Romans; and then you may go home and tell your fellow-
  countrymen how much braver the Gauls are than any other people."</p>

  <p>"But," said the ambassador, "what right have you to come and take the
  lands of Clusium? What have you to do in Etruria?"</p>

  <p>"That I will soon show you with this good sword," cried the Gaul fiercely.
  "A brave man has a right to everything."</p>

  <p>So the ambassadors went back to Clusium, and all was got ready for
  fighting.</p>

  <p>Now it has always been a rule among nations that an ambassador ought to
  take no part in war. He must not fight; and if he were to be harmed by any
  one of the people to whom he is sent, it would be a great wrong. But the
  Roman ambassadors, when they saw their Clusian friends march out against the
  Gauls, could not resist the pleasure of going with them. The battle began,
  and Quintus Fabius attacked the Gaulish general and ran him through with his
  spear. The Gauls soon found out that it was the Roman ambassador who had
  killed their general, and their rage against the Romans was so great, that
  they left off fighting the Clusians, and marched away to their camp to plan
  what should be done. Some of them wished to march straight to Rome; but the
  elder men determined first to send messengers to the Senate, to ask that the
  Fabii should be given up to them.</p>

  <p>The Romans, however, instead of punishing the Fabii, praised them, and
  chose them to be chief officers in the army for the next year. When the Gauls
  heard of this their anger was very great, for they were a passionate and
  savage people, and they at once set out for Rome. The people in the towns and
  villages through which they passed were very much frightened at the wild and
  strange warriors; but they, when they saw the people trying to run away to
  save themselves, cried out in a loud voice that they would do them no harm,
  and that they were going to punish the Romans.</p>

  <p>News soon came to Rome of the terrible enemy that was so near; and the
  Fabii and the other generals led out the army to meet them. The generals were
  careless and did not make great preparations, as they ought to have done,
  against their new foes. The soldiers too, instead of being eager for battle
  as they usually were, were very much afraid of these fierce strangers, whose
  arms and looks and ways of fighting were quite different from anything ever
  seen in Southern Italy before. And if they were afraid when they set out,
  they grew much more terrified when the two armies came near together, and
  they could hear the Gauls shouting out their war-songs and clashing their
  arms, as their wild and savage fashion was.</p>

  <p>They met on the banks of the river Allia, eleven miles from Rome. Brennus,
  the king of the Gauls, led his army to the attack, and the battle did not
  last long, for neither officers nor soldiers in the Roman army behaved like
  Romans. They thought of nothing but of saving themselves, and turned and fled
  without striking a single blow. Many went to Veii, others tried to swim
  across the Tiber, and many were drowned there, being tired and weighed down
  by their heavy armour; many were slain by the enemy as they tried to escape;
  others got safely to Rome, and fled into the Capitol in such haste, that they
  did not even shut the city gates after them.</p>

  <p>The Gauls were quite astonished by their easy victory, and for a while
  stood still as if they hardly knew what had happened. But at last, seeing
  that the Romans had all fled, they marched on and reached the city about
  sunset. When they found that the gates were open, and saw that no one came to
  resist them, they thought that the army must be concealed in the city ready
  to attack them if they went in. So, as the evening was coming on, they
  encamped outside the walls for the night.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the terror in Rome was such as had never been known there
  before. The Romans supposed that all their army had been killed except the
  small number who had escaped to Rome; for they did not know that a much
  larger number had fled to Veii. The whole city was filled with wailing and
  lamenting. As they had no hope of defending the city with so few soldiers, it
  was resolved that the young and strong men, with their wives and children,
  and the strongest of the senators, should go to the Capitol, which was a
  steep rocky hill defended with strong walls and towers.</p>

  <p>Arms and food were got together, and taken to the Capitol. They thought if
  they could defend the temples of the gods, which were on this hill, and keep
  alive the strongest of the people and some of the senate, that the loss of
  the old people and of the rest of the city would have to be borne. And that
  the people who were left in the city might bear their fate more patiently,
  the aged nobles, many of whom were senators, and had been consuls, declared
  themselves ready to die with them; so that they might not be a burden to the
  small number of men who were able to fight.</p>

  <p>Many of the people fled out of the city; some went to neighbouring towns,
  others wandered about in the fields. Some of the priests and priestesses (or
  vestal virgins as they were called) carried away the statues of the gods and
  other sacred things, and fled with them to a town not far off.</p>

  <p>When all had been made ready for the defence of the Capitol, the old men
  went back into their houses. Those who had been consuls, or had held any
  other high office, clad themselves in their splendid embroidered robes, and
  seated themselves in their ivory chairs, and thus they waited for the coming
  of the enemy.</p>

  <p>The Gauls spent the night outside the town, as I told you, but when
  morning came they marched in. They were much surprised to find no one in the
  streets, or public places; so after setting a small number of men to watch
  the Capitol, lest the garrison there should attack them unexpectedly, they
  began to go into the houses to look for plunder, and finding the doors of the
  great houses where the nobles lived unfastened, they first went in to them.
  There, to their great astonishment, they found the grand old nobles sitting
  in their chairs of state so still and quiet that the Gauls did not know if
  they were real men or statues of the gods. Then a Gaul stretched out his hand
  and touched the long white beard of Papirius, one of these old nobles, to see
  if he were alive. Papirius, angry at the insult, struck the rude soldier on
  the head with his ivory staff. At this the Gaul quickly drew his sword, and
  killed the old Roman. Then the slaughter began. The Gauls killed the old men,
  and plundered their houses, and then rushed into the other houses, plundering
  and setting them on fire, and killing the people who had not fled.</p>

  <p>When the Romans in the Capitol saw their dear city full of enemies,
  plundering and burning and killing, and heard their shouts, the cries of the
  Romans, and the noise of the falling houses, they were full of misery and
  sorrow. They were so few that they could do nothing to help their friends;
  but their courage still did not fail them, and they resolved to defend the
  little hill which was all they had left to the very last.</p>

  <p>After some days, when the Gauls had finished burning and plundering the
  city, they began to wish to take the Capitol too. First they made an attack
  upon it, and tried to climb up the sides of the hill. The Romans let them
  come half-way up, and then suddenly set upon them, threw them down the steep
  rocks, and killed a great many. So, finding that they could not take the
  Capitol by force, they resolved to lay siege to it. They left a small number
  of their warriors to guard it, so that no one should go in or come out, while
  others of their troops plundered the country round, or attacked the towns
  that were near.</p>

  <p>I told you in the last story that the brave Camillus had been banished
  from Rome; he had gone to live in a town called Ardea. When he heard of all
  the misfortunes of his country, he was more unhappy than his own troubles had
  made him; and he wondered what had become of those brave soldiers who had
  fought with him at Veii and Falerii. News was brought to Ardea that the Gauls
  were coming, and the terrified Ardeans asked Camillus what they should do.
  When he heard these things, he went to the Ardean Assembly, and spoke in
  these words to the people:</p>

  <p>"My old friends of Ardea," he said, "I hope none of you think that I
  forget all the kindness you have shown me since I came to your city. And now
  in this danger it is fitting that every one should do what he can for the
  common good. How can I show you how grateful I am to you, better than at such
  a time? And how can I be of use to you except in war? For in my own country I
  had some fame as a soldier. Now, then, Ardeans, you have a chance of repaying
  the Romans for all their kindness to you, and also of winning for your city a
  glorious name in war. The people that are coming against you are men who are
  very big, but not so strong as they look. They are tired with the siege of
  Rome, and they wander about the country, filling themselves with meat and
  wine, which they get by thieving. When night comes on they lay themselves
  down without any camp or sentinels, in the fields or by the river sides, like
  so many wild beasts; and since their victory they are even more careless than
  they were before. Now, then, if you dare defend your town, stand to your arms
  when evening comes on, and follow me; and if I do not give you the chance to
  kill them like wild beasts when they are asleep, banish me from Ardea, as I
  was banished from Rome!"</p>

  <p>Everybody before this believed that there never was such a man for war as
  Camillus, and the Ardeans now followed his advice. As soon as it grew dark,
  they met him at the city gates. He led them out, and they had not gone far
  before they came to the place where the army of the Gauls lay sleeping. There
  were no guards nor sentinels, so the Ardeans rushed upon them, and killed
  great numbers of them, unarmed and asleep. Of the rest of the army, some were
  killed by the people of other towns near Ardea, and some fled away to their
  fellow-countrymen at Rome.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the part of the Roman army which had gone to Veii was
  getting larger; for not only more Romans came to join them, who had fled from
  Rome when the Gauls took it, but many soldiers came in from the towns of
  Latium to help them. When they heard of the victory that Camillus had won
  over the Gauls, they determined to ask him to come and lead them. They did
  not like to do this without asking the leave of the senators at Rome; yet it
  was a difficult thing to get to them, as they were on the Capitol surrounded
  by the army of the Gauls. A young man called Pontius Cominius offered to do
  his best to take the message. He easily got to the Tiber, and then swam down
  the river till he came to Rome. The side of the Capitol nearest the river was
  a very steep craggy rock, and the Gauls did not watch it as carefully as the
  other sides, thinking that no one could climb it. But Pontius crept out of
  the river, managed to scramble up the rock, and so got into the Capitol. He
  was taken to the senators, and gave them his message from the army at Veii.
  They were very glad to hear the good news he brought, and sent word to the
  soldiers that the Senate recalled Camillus from banishment and made him
  dictator. The young man then went back the same way that he had come, and got
  safely to Veii.</p>

  <p>Now, though Pontius got safely away, he had not been able to help leaving
  on the rocks the marks of where he had scrambled down, and the Gauls, when
  they saw these footprints, found out that some one had been up the cliffs
  which they thought could not be climbed.</p>

  <p>"If the Romans can get up, why should not the Gauls do the same?" said one
  of the boldest of them. And the next night, when it was dark, he climbed up.
  When he came down, it was resolved that a party should go up and attack the
  Romans while they were asleep. So they began to climb, helping one another
  and pulling one another up as best they could, all without speaking a
  word.</p>

  <p>Now the Romans, trusting in the steepness of the rocks, kept careless
  guard; they were all asleep, and so quietly did the Gauls come up that no one
  heard them; even the dogs slept on. But in one of the temples near the walls
  there were some geese which were sacred to Juno the goddess of that temple.
  These geese were disturbed by some sound that the Gauls made, and began to
  cackle and clap their wings. They made such a noise that they awoke Marcus
  Manlius, a brave Roman, who had been consul three years before. Springing up,
  and seizing his weapons, Manlius ran out to see what was the matter. When he
  came near the temple, what was his surprise to see the tall figure of a Gaul
  standing on the wall at the top of the rock. Manlius shouted to the other
  Romans to follow him, and rushing at the Gaul he gave him such a blow with
  his shield, that he knocked him right off the wall and down the rocks
  outside. The fall of this man knocked down some of those who were standing
  below him, and frightened the others so that they dropped their weapons. By
  this time the other Romans had joined Manlius, and they threw their spears
  and large stones down upon the Gauls, putting them into such fear that they
  fell down the rock, and many of them were killed.</p>

  <p>Next morning the soldiers were called together before the generals, who
  praised Manlius for his bravery; but they ordered that the sentinel who ought
  to have been watching the part of the wall where the Gauls climbed up, should
  be thrown down the rock.</p>

  <p>After this both the Roman and Gaulish guards kept better watch. But now
  both parties began to be troubled by want of food, and many of the Gauls fell
  ill and died. They were used to live in a much cooler country, and the heat
  of Rome made them ill. The Romans, too, were quite tired of being shut up in
  the Capitol. Their food was nearly finished, the soldiers grew so weak that
  they could hardly bear the weight of their arms, and they began to think that
  the dictator Camillus would never come to drive away the Gauls. So both
  parties were very glad to make a truce, that is, to agree that they would not
  fight each other for several days. The Romans said they would make any
  conditions the Gauls liked, and the Gauls said they would go away if the
  Romans would give them a thousand pounds weight of gold. The Romans agreed to
  this, and Sulpicius, one of the generals, was sent to Brennus the king of the
  Gauls to pay him. The gold had to be weighed, for it was not in coins, such
  as we have, but in lumps. The Gauls tried to use weights which were not fair,
  so as to get more gold than they ought to have had. Sulpicius saw this, and
  told them it was unfair and shameful. Then King Brennus threw his sword into
  the scale, exclaiming, "Woe to the conquered!"</p>

  <p>The weighing was not yet done, when, to the joy of the Romans, the
  dictator Camillus and his soldiers arrived. When he saw what they were doing
  he was very angry.</p>

  <p>"Begone," he said to the Gauls, "and do you, Romans, take away that
  gold."</p>

  <p>The Romans at first said they could not obey him, and told him what they
  had promised before he came.</p>

  <p>"The promise cannot be kept," he answered; "no Roman had any right to make
  such a promise without the leave of the dictator."</p>

  <p>Then turning to Brennus, he bade him get his men ready for battle.</p>

  <p>The Gauls seized their arms, and attacked the Romans with more rage than
  skill. They were driven back and forced to fly, and at last had to march out
  of the city. The Romans followed them, and another battle was fought about
  eight miles from Rome in which the Gauls were all killed, their camp was
  taken, and not one man was left to carry the news back to their own
  country.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE GULF IN THE FORUM</h2>

  <p class="first">SOME years after the taking of Rome by the Gauls, the people
  of Rome were greatly troubled by a strange thing that happened in the
  city.</p>

  <p>The ground in the middle of the Forum, or market place, split and sunk
  down to a great depth, leaving a large hole or gulf so deep that no man could
  tell where the bottom of it might be. The Romans tried to fill it up, and
  threw in cartloads of earth and stones; but it was of no use. However much
  they threw in, the gulf still seemed to be as deep as ever; do what they
  would, they could not find the bottom.</p>

  <p>So wonderful a thing, the people thought, must be caused by the anger of
  the gods. They enquired of the prophets, and begged them to pray to the gods,
  and to say what the Roman people must do to win pardon.</p>

  <p>At last the prophets brought their answer, which was as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If the Roman people would have their republic last for ever, let them
  throw into the gulf the best and most precious thing that there is in
  Rome."</p>

  <p>Then all the people began to consult and talk together, that they might
  find out what was the most precious thing in Rome. Some said gold, and others
  jewels, and others corn. Some said one thing and some another.</p>

  <p>But a brave young man called Marcus Curtius came forward, and said,</p>

  <p>"There is nothing in Rome so precious as the brave heart and good weapons
  of a Roman."</p>

  <p>Then, when all were silent, he looked at the temples of the gods that
  stood on the Capitol and could be seen from the Forum, and stretching his
  hands out first towards heaven and then towards the deep gulf at his feet, he
  vowed to sacrifice himself for Rome.</p>

  <p>He then put on his armour, and mounting his good horse rode to the gulf
  and leaped in, while crowds of men and women flung fruit and flowers in after
  him. The earth closed over him; and for hundreds of years afterwards the
  place where the gulf had been was called the Curtian Pool.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE STORY OF TITUS MANLIUS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Romans were taught from their childhood that they ought
  to love their country more than any other thing. They were also taught that
  it was their duty to obey their father, and that he might do anything he
  pleased with them. Even if a Roman father were cruel or unkind, his son would
  have been thought very bad if he had not been obedient and dutiful to him. To
  show you how real and strong this feeling was, I will tell you the story of
  Titus Manlius.</p>

  <p>There lived in Rome a man of noble family called Lucius Manlius, who,
  because of his proud and stern temper was surnamed "The Imperious." He was
  made dictator, and raised troops in Rome to fight against a neighbouring
  people called the Hernicans.</p>

  <p>Lucius Manlius had one son, whose name was Titus. This young man was not
  clever, and stammered when he spoke; his father treated him unkindly, for he
  would not let Titus live in Rome, but sent him away into a country village,
  where he lived with the rough peasants, and had no chance of being able to
  learn and improve himself.</p>

  <p>The Romans did not like the proud Manlius, and when his time of being
  dictator was over one of the tribunes of the people, called Marcus Pomponius,
  brought a complaint against him. Pomponius said that Manlius had been very
  cruel and severe in his way of raising the troops.</p>

  <p>"He has," said the tribune, "taken a great deal of money from the people,
  and has imprisoned them and had them beaten. Besides all this, he has kept
  his own son, who has done no wrong, away from the city and his home, putting
  him to hard and rough work; and treating the young man like a slave instead
  of like the son of the greatest man in Rome. And why has Manlius done all
  this? Because the poor young man could not speak well, but stammered in his
  talk. Ought he not rather, if he had been a kind father, to have been more
  tender to his son, instead of punishing him for what was not a fault but a
  misfortune?"</p>

  <p>When Titus Manlius heard that his father had been accused of cruelty to
  him, he was very angry, for he was an obedient son, and he thought that he
  ought to do and bear whatever his father wished. He was so unhappy that his
  father should be brought into trouble on his account, that he set off at once
  for Rome. He arrived there very early in the morning, and went straight to
  the house of the tribune Pomponius.</p>

  <p>When Titus asked to see the tribune, the servants told him that he was
  still in bed; but they went and told their master that the son of Manlius had
  come, and wanted to speak to him. The tribune hoped that Titus had some
  complaint to make against his father, and sent for him to come in.</p>

  <p>When they had saluted each other, Titus spoke.</p>

  <p>"I must see you alone, Pomponius," he said, "for I have a secret which
  none must hear but you."</p>

  <p>The servants left them, and as soon as they were alone Titus drew a dagger
  from his belt, and standing over the tribune&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Swear to me," he cried, "that you will never call the people together to
  judge my father, or I will stab you at once!"</p>

  <p>The tribune was dreadfully frightened when he saw the dagger glitter
  before his eyes. He was alone and unarmed; the young man was strong and
  active, and really meant to do as he had said. So Pomponius was obliged to
  swear that he would go no further in his accusation against the elder
  Manlius.</p>

  <p>The people were very sorry that they could not punish this stern and cruel
  man, for the tribune was obliged to keep his word; but they could not help
  admiring the love and duty of Titus, who was so good a son to so unkind a
  father. And in that same year they chose him to be one of the chief officers
  of the army.</p>

  <p>Not long after this a war broke out between the Romans and the Gauls. The
  Roman army, commanded by the dictator, Titus Quintius Pennus, marched out to
  meet the Gauls, who had encamped about three miles from Rome, near a bridge
  over the river Anio. Quintius pitched his camp on the other side of the
  river, nearer to Rome; so the bridge was between the two armies. Both tried
  hard to get possession of it, and there was a good deal of fighting; but
  neither party could keep the bridge, and at last the armies went back each to
  its own side of the river.</p>

  <p>Then a gigantic Gaul came forward all alone upon the empty bridge, and
  waving his sword in the air, shouted aloud&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Let the bravest man among the Romans come out and fight with me, that we
  may see if the Gauls or the Romans are the best warriors."</p>

  <p>The bravest of the Roman youths stood silent for a while, ashamed to
  refuse to fight, yet not liking the danger of meeting so fierce an enemy. At
  last Titus Manlius came forward to the dictator.</p>

  <p>"General," he said, "I should never have dared to step out of the ranks to
  fight without your orders,&mdash;no, not if I had been sure that I should win
  the victory. But, if you will give me leave, I will show this great hulking
  brute, who is strutting and bragging in front of the Gaulish standards, that
  I am come of the same race as that Manlius who threw the Gauls down the
  Tarpeian Rock."</p>

  <p>"Well said, brave Manlius!" answered the dictator, "you show that your
  love for your country is as great as your love for your father. Go on, and by
  the help of the gods let these Gauls see that Rome is not to be
  conquered."</p>

  <p>Then the young man's friends helped him to put on his armour. He took the
  shield of a foot soldier, and girt himself with a good Spanish sword. So they
  led him forth against the Gaul, who, as the savage custom of his people was,
  showed his joy at meeting his enemy by shouting out his war song, and making
  mocking faces at the Roman. Then the rest returned to their places, and the
  champions were left between the armies, who stood to watch the fight with the
  greatest eagerness. It was more like seeing a play acted than looking at a
  real combat, so different did the two warriors appear, and so unequal did
  they seem.</p>

  <p>The Gaul was of gigantic size and great strength; he was clad in a garment
  checked with many colours, his painted armour glittered with gold, and round
  his neck he wore a twisted collar of gold. He carried a shield and a long and
  heavy broadsword. The Roman, though much smaller, was strong and active. His
  dress was not half so gay, and his armour was more useful than splendid. He
  came forward quietly, without useless shouts or wavings of his weapons, but
  keeping all his strength for the hard work of the battle. Thus they stood
  between the two armies; and the Gaul, who towered above the Roman, holding
  his shield before his body with his left hand, struck at Manlius with his
  long broadsword. So great a stroke was it that the noise of it could be heard
  far away as Manlius caught it on his shield, and so remained unhurt. Then,
  before the Gaul had time to strike again, Manlius ran close to him, and
  knocking up the giant's shield with his own, he plunged his short
  double-edged sword again and again into the body of his enemy. Down fell the
  Gaul, and his gigantic body lay stretched out covering a great space of
  ground. Manlius stooped down, and unfastening from the throat of the dead man
  the golden collar he wore, clasped it round his own neck, and returned to his
  friends. The army of the Gauls was struck with surprise and fear, but the
  Romans with shouts of joy and triumph led their brave young champion to the
  dictator. And from that day Manlius was called Torquatus, from the Latin word
  (torquis) which means a collar, because he had won the golden collar from the
  gigantic Gaul.</p>

  <p>The end of the story of Titus Manlius is a sad one, but it is interesting.
  You will hear how he who gave such full obedience to his own father, and also
  to his general, expected the same obedience and duty from his son, and you
  will hear too how sternly he punished that son for the want of it.</p>

  <p>Many years after the fight between Manlius and the Gaul there was a war
  between the Romans and the Latins. Manlius was then one of the consuls, and
  he and his fellow consul led the Roman army out and encamped before the town
  of Capua. The Latins were of the same race as the Romans, their manners,
  customs, and language were the same; and as they had been allies, many of the
  Romans had friends in the Latin army. The consuls, because of this, agreed
  together that the soldiers must be kept very strictly and severely. And they
  sent a crier through the camp to say that no man was to fight with the enemy
  out of his rank, or without the command of the consuls.</p>

  <p>Now it happened that among the leaders of the horsemen who were sent out
  from the Roman camp to find out what the Latins were doing was a son of the
  consul Manlius, who was called Titus, as his father was. Young Manlius was
  very brave and full of spirit, and was eager to make his name famous by some
  brave deed as his father had done. One day, when he was riding out with his
  troop, he met a party of the enemy's horsemen, whose leader was a young man
  of noble family and great courage, named Geminus Mettius. Mettius knew the
  consul's son, and called out to him:</p>

  <p>"What," said he, "do you Romans mean to fight the Latins with one troop of
  horse? What has become of your two consuls and your great army?"</p>

  <p>"You will see what has become of them soon enough," answered Manlius. "At
  the battle of Lake Regillus you had as much fighting with us as you wanted;
  but you shall have plenty more of it before we have done with you."</p>

  <p>Mettius laughed.</p>

  <p>"Before that dreadful day comes," said he, "when you mean to do such
  wonderful things, will you dare to fight with me, that all the world may see
  how much braver a Latin knight is than a Roman."</p>

  <p>Manlius was very angry at the mocking words of Mettius, and forgetting his
  father's commands and the decree of the consuls, he said he was ready to
  fight. The rest of the horsemen stood aside so as to give the two young men
  plenty of room for the battle, and they set spurs to their horses, and
  charged one another fiercely with their sharply-pointed spears. The lance of
  Manlius just grazed the helmet of the Latin, while Mettius slightly wounded
  the neck of the Roman's horse. Then turning their horses they charged again.
  Manlius raised himself in his saddle and pierced his enemy's horse between
  the ears. The horse, frightened by the pain of the wound, reared and plunged,
  and threw Mettius; and while he was trying to get on his feet again, Manlius
  ran his spear into his throat, and so killed him. Then, dismounting, he
  seized the arms of the Latin, carried them to his companions, and rode back
  in triumph with them to the Roman camp. He hastened to his father's tent,
  little thinking of what was going to happen.</p>

  <p>"Father," said he, when he stood before the consul, "to show you that I am
  worthy to be your son, I bring you here the spoils of a Latin knight who
  defied and challenged me, and whom I have slain fairly in single combat."</p>

  <p>When the consul had heard his son's words, he answered him nothing, but
  turned away his face. Presently he ordered the soldiers to be called together
  by the sound of a trumpet, and then, in the presence of all, he spoke to his
  son in these words:</p>

  <p>"Titus Manlius, you have forgotten the obedience a soldier owes his
  general, and the respect a son should show to his father's commands, and you
  have dared to fight the enemy against our orders. If you were not to be
  punished for doing this, the Roman soldiers, who, till now, have been careful
  in their duty and obedient to their leaders, might grow careless, and so the
  army of Rome would become weak and useless. Now, therefore, I must choose
  whether I will do my duty to Rome and punish my son, or whether my love for
  my son shall make me forget my duty to Rome. I choose that you and I shall
  pay for our rashness and folly, but that Rome shall not be the worse.</p>

  <p>"As for me, the love that all fathers feel for their children, and the
  proofs of your courage that you have just shown me, grieve me deeply; but
  since you must die for having disobeyed the consuls, show me that you are
  worthy to be my son by submitting cheerfully to the punishment."</p>

  <p>Then he bade the lictors bind his son, which they did, and then cut off
  his head.</p>

  <p>The army was greatly surprised by the severity of the consul, and very
  sorry for the brave young Manlius, and a splendid funeral was made for him.
  But the fear of being treated in the same way made the soldiers more
  obedient, and the guards and sentinels more watchful. This did much good in
  the war that followed, which ended in the victory of the Romans.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE DEATH OF DECIUS</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the last story I told you how Titus Manlius loved his
  country better than his son. Now I am going to tell you how Publius Decius
  Mus, who was consul at the same time as Manlius, loved his country better
  than himself.</p>

  <p>Some years before the time when Manlius and Decius were consuls together,
  a war broke out between the Romans and the Samnites. Valerius Corvus, who was
  then consul, gained a great victory over the Samnites in Campania. The other
  consul, Cornelius Cossus, advanced towards Samnium, and in doing so led his
  army through a pass in which was a narrow valley. On one side of this valley
  the Samnite army was hidden among the rocks, so that the Romans could not see
  them. The Samnites intended, as soon as all the Roman army were in the valley
  and trying to make their way through the narrowest part, to rush upon them
  and so win an easy victory. Fortunately the Romans found out that the
  Samnites were in ambush there before the whole army was in the valley; and
  while the consul was planning how he could get his soldiers safely out of
  this dangerous place, Publius Decius, one of his officers, came to him.
  Decius had noticed that there was in the pass a hill from which all that was
  being done by the Samnites could be seen, and that it would be easy for
  lightly armed men to seize it before the enemy could prevent them.</p>

  <p>"See you not, Cornelius," he said to the consul, "the top of yonder hill
  above the Samnites? If we can take that hill we shall be safe. Give me a few
  soldiers and let me try to take it; and if I do so, then do you march your
  army out of the pass without fear. For the enemy being just under the hill
  will not dare to follow you for fear of our attacking them behind. As to us,
  the good fortune of Rome and our own courage will bring us safely back to
  you."</p>

  <p>The consul praised Decius for his brave plan; and having got together the
  soldiers he had asked for, he marched quickly and silently through the rocks,
  and got possession of the hill before the enemy noticed him.</p>

  <p>The Samnites did not know what to do when they found that Decius had
  posted himself so well on the top of the hill. They did not dare to pursue
  the consul, who was now able to march the main body of the army safely out of
  the pass, and they were afraid to charge up the hill and attack Decius.
  Before they could make up their minds what to do, night came on.</p>

  <p>Decius wondered that the Samnites did not attack him; but when evening
  came, he called some of his officers together and spoke to them.</p>

  <p>"How idle or how ignorant these Samnites are," said he; "they might by
  this time have shut us up in ditches and walls, but not a man has begun to
  work. They do not seem to know what to do. But we shall be as stupid as they
  are if we stay here a minute longer than we need. Come on then with me; and
  before it grows too dark, let us see how they have placed their guards and
  where we may get out most easily."</p>

  <p>Then he and some of the other officers dressed themselves like common
  soldiers, and so went and found out all that he wanted to know. Then he sent
  word to the soldiers that they should all come to him quite silently and
  ready armed.</p>

  <p>"Fellow soldiers," he said, "keep silence while I speak to you, and if you
  agree to my plan, show me that you do so by going to my right hand. We are
  here surrounded by an enemy; but we are not like men who have been overtaken
  because they are lazy or cowardly. You won this place by your bravery, and
  the same bravery must help you to get out. You saved a Roman army by coming
  here&mdash;now save yourselves. You who delivered so many though you are so
  few, you need no help but your own. We have to do with an enemy so stupid
  that they never found out this important hill till we had taken it. You
  outwitted them when they were awake; surely it will not be difficult to do so
  again now that they are asleep.</p>

  <p>"There is only one way of safety left us. We must sally out and make our
  way through the Samnites who surround us. Now they are all sound asleep, and
  you shall try to pass through them in silence without their knowing that you
  are there; but if they wake, then astonish them by setting up a sudden outcry
  and dreadful shouts, and cut your way through them with your good swords. And
  now, let those of you who think my plan a good one pass to my right
  hand."</p>

  <p>Every man of them went to his right hand, and Decius at once led them down
  the hill, and into the enemy's camp.</p>

  <p>They had got safely to the middle of the camp, when one of the Romans as
  he stepped across the guards who were lying fast asleep, happened to stumble
  against a shield, which gave such a clang that the sentinel to whom it
  belonged awoke. Starting up he woke the man next him, who gave the alarm to
  others. At first the Samnites did not know whether these strangers were
  friends or enemies, whether they were the Romans on the hill, or whether they
  were some of the consul's soldiers come back to attack them. But Decius now
  commanded his men to set up a shout, which they did, and so startled and
  amazed the Samnites that they were all confused and did not know what to do.
  So Decius and his soldiers, striking down the guards who tried to stop them,
  broke through, and got safely away from their foes.</p>

  <p>It was still dark, and when they had got quite out of danger, Decius
  stopped and spoke to his followers.</p>

  <p>"This noble deed of yours, my brave Romans," he said, "will be praised and
  admired for many a hundred years. But now, you deserve better than that
  darkness and silence should cover you when you return with so much glory to
  the camp. Here, therefore, let us rest and wait for day."</p>

  <p>The soldiers obeyed him gladly, and as soon as it was light he sent a
  messenger to the consul to tell him of their coming. As soon as the soldiers
  in the Roman camp heard that the brave men who had risked their lives to save
  the army were coming back safe, they ran out to meet them with thanks and
  praises, calling them deliverers, and giving thanks to the gods. When Decius
  and his followers came to the consul's tent, Cornelius called all the army
  together by sound of trumpet, and began to make a speech to them in praise of
  Decius.</p>

  <p>But Decius interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"General," he said, "do not waste the time in praising me, but take the
  chance and attack the Samnites while they are still in fear and wonder."</p>

  <p>The consul took his advice, and the army at once marched back and charged
  the enemy, who did not expect them, and were quite unprepared.</p>

  <p>Many of the Samnites were unarmed and straggling about the pass. The
  Romans easily drove them back into their camp, and then followed them there,
  took and plundered it, and killed a great many of the Samnites.</p>

  <p>Next day the consul called the Roman army together, and finished making
  the speech in praise of Decius, which had been interrupted the day before.
  Many rich presents were given to Decius, and among them was a crown of gold.
  His brave soldiers too were well rewarded.</p>

  <p>I must now go on to that war against the Latins, in which young Titus
  Manlius was put to death by his father's order. The elder Manlius and Decius
  were consuls at that time, as I told you. After the death of the young man,
  the two consuls resolved to fight a battle with the Latins, and they drew up
  their army in proper order, Manlius leading the right and Decius the left
  wing. At first they fought on both sides with the same bravery, but after a
  while the Romans on the left wing, who were commanded by Decius, found the
  Latins too strong for them, and began to give way.</p>

  <p>When Decius saw this he called to him Marcus Valerius, the high priest of
  the Romans, and said,</p>

  <p>"I see, Valerius, that we are now in want of the help of the gods. Do you
  now, therefore, say the solemn words with which I may devote myself for our
  army, and I will repeat them after you."</p>

  <p>The Romans believed that a general could certainly win victory for his
  army by <i>devoting</i> himself as they called it. The general must say some
  very solemn words, standing in one particular way, and wearing a certain
  dress. Then if he let himself be killed directly afterwards, they believed
  that the army against which he was fighting would certainly be destroyed.</p>

  <p>Valerius told Decius to put on a long embroidered purple mantle, and to
  cover his head with it; then to stand with both his feet on a spear, while he
  said after him these words:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"O Jupiter, Mars, and all ye heavenly and infernal gods, I ask your pardon
  and I pray for your favour. I pray that you will give victory and power to
  the people of Rome, and strike their enemies with fear and death. And for the
  good of the people of Rome, I here devote the army of the enemy and myself to
  the infernal gods."</p>

  <p>When he had said this prayer, he sent a messenger to the other consul,
  Manlius, to tell him what he had done. Then, girding his purple mantle round
  him and taking his arms, he mounted his horse and spurred into the midst of
  the enemy. To both armies he seemed wonderful, more like a god than a man.
  Wherever he came he terrified the Latins; he rode right through their front
  ranks, and then charged into their main body, while they stood trembling,
  struck with fear and awe. And when at last he fell, beaten down by numbers,
  the Latins began to give back in their terror, while the Romans fell upon
  them with redoubled courage.</p>

  <p>When Manlius heard of what Decius had done, he wept for him and praised
  him for daring to die for Rome. Then he led on some of the Roman troops who
  had not yet fought.</p>

  <p>"Forward!" he said. "Remember your country and your parents, your wives
  and children, and more than all remember your noble consul, who gave himself
  to die that you might win the victory."</p>

  <p>The soldiers, full of hope and courage, charged the Latins with such fury
  that they defeated them, killed a great number, and put the rest to
  flight.</p>

  <p>The body of the brave Decius could not be found that day, for it was late
  when the battle was over, and evening was coming on. But next morning it was
  found lying covered with darts and spears among a heap of Latins whom he had
  killed. Manlius made a splendid funeral for him, as his great courage well
  deserved.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE CAUDINE FORKS</h2>

  <p class="first">SOME distance to the south of Rome, among the Apennine
  mountains, lay the country of Samnium, where lived a brave and warlike
  people, who were for many years at war with the Romans.</p>

  <p>The general of the Samnites, at the time I am going to tell you about, was
  called Caius Pontius. He was a brave and skilful soldier, the son of a very
  wise old man, whose name was Herennius.</p>

  <p>When Pontius heard that the Romans were marching against Samnium, he led
  his army to a place called Caudium, in the mountains between Rome and his own
  country. He made some of his soldiers take off their armour and dress
  themselves like shepherds. Then he sent them towards the Roman camp, driving
  sheep before them&mdash;so that the Roman sentinels, when they saw them,
  thought they were real shepherds. The Romans took the disguised Samnite
  soldiers prisoners, and led them before their consul, Spurius Postumius.</p>

  <p>Postumius asked the Samnites, whom he supposed to be shepherds, to tell
  him anything they could about the Samnite army&mdash;where it was, and what
  it was doing. They answered him, as their general had told them to do, that
  the Samnite army was gone into Apulia in the south of Italy, and that it was
  besieging Luceria, a town whose people were friends and allies of the Romans.
  Now, as these pretended shepherds all told the same story, Postumius thought
  it must be true, and he determined to go to the help of the Lucerians.</p>

  <p>The shortest road to Luceria was past Caudium, where, as I told you,
  Pontius and his army really were. Near Caudium is a place called the Caudine
  Forks&mdash;and I will try to describe it to you, that you may understand
  what afterwards happened. The road to Caudium went through a very narrow pass
  or valley between two steep rocky cliffs; on the other side of the pass, the
  valley widened out into a large green meadow or plain covered with grass, and
  quite surrounded by steep hills.</p>

  <p>The road went across this plain and then through another little pass
  between rocks steeper and more difficult even than the first. These two
  passes were called the Caudine Forks.</p>

  <p>The Roman army marched through the first pass, and across the plain
  without any difficulty, but when they got to the second pass their surprise
  was great to find the road blocked up with piles of great stones, and with
  trees which had been cut down and thrown across it, so that neither man nor
  horse could get through. At the same time they saw the Samnite army appear on
  the hills above the pass, so as to prevent them from going round.</p>

  <p>As quickly as they could, the Romans turned and retreated across the plain
  to the pass by which they had come; but when they got there they found that
  the way out was blocked in the same manner, and guarded too by Samnite
  troops. All along the tops of the hills round them they could see their
  enemies, whom Pontius had placed there, and they felt that they were shut in
  hopelessly, and were so astonished that they stood for a long time as still
  as statues, not knowing which way to turn, or what to do. At last they set to
  work to pitch their camp and to fortify it, though they saw very well how
  useless the work was, and knew that the Samnites might, if they pleased, keep
  them shut up in that deep valley, till they were starved to death. The
  Samnite soldiers looked on, and laughed and mocked at the unhappy Romans, who
  turned to their generals and asked from them the comfort and help which the
  generals could not give.</p>

  <p>By and by the night came on, and the soldiers gathering together, began to
  talk over their dreadful position, and to make plans as to what was to be
  done.</p>

  <p>"Let us break through the blockade," said one, "and force our way along
  the road."</p>

  <p>"Were it not better," cried another, "to climb up the mountain sides and
  through the woods,&mdash;any way so that we carry our swords with us and that
  we may come at the enemy? If we could only get at them, it would be easy
  enough to us Romans to fight these pitiful Samnites, whom we have beaten so
  often in the last thirty years.</p>

  <p>"Pooh!" said a third. "How can we possibly get at the enemy, with these
  steep hills hanging almost over our heads. What does it matter whether we are
  armed or unarmed, whether we are brave men or cowards? We are caught like
  rats in a trap, and the Samnites need not even trouble themselves to draw
  their swords to kill us, but may sit still and watch us die."</p>

  <p>In such talk they passed the night, caring neither to take food or
  sleep.</p>

  <p>The Samnites did not know what to do, or what would be the best way to use
  their victory. At last they decided to send to Herennius Pontius, the father
  of their general, who, as I said, was a very wise man, and ask him what they
  had better do. Herennius was now very old, and was living a quiet life away
  from the toils both of war and of government But though his body was so weak,
  his mind was strong, and his advice was very much respected by all the
  Samnite people.</p>

  <p>When his son's messengers came to him, he sent back word that the Samnites
  had better let the Roman army go home safe and unhurt. The Samnites did not
  like this message at all, and told the messengers to go a second time to
  Herennius, and ask him again what they should do.</p>

  <p>"Let them kill every one of the Romans," said Herennius.</p>

  <p>When these words were told to the Samnites, they began to think that the
  old man's mind must be growing as weak as his body, and that he could have no
  meaning in sending two such different messages. Still, they thought Herennius
  so wise, that they sent the messengers a third time, to persuade him to come
  to their camp, that they might hear what he really thought with their own
  ears. So the old man was laid in a cart, and driven to the Samnite camp; and
  when he got there he spoke to them in these words:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I advised you to let the Romans go safely home, because if you do so
  great a kindness to this brave people, you will make them your firm friends
  for ever. But if you will not do this you must kill them all, so that they
  may not return to fight you again; for the shame of their defeat will make
  them hate you more than ever, and they will be more fierce and dreadful
  enemies than they are now. If you will not do either of these things I have
  no third advice to give you."</p>

  <p>Then Pontius asked him if it would not be better to spare the lives of the
  Romans, but to make them promise that they would not fight against the
  Samnites again.</p>

  <p>"By doing this," answered Herennius, "you will neither make the Romans
  your friends nor prevent them from being your enemies. They are such a proud
  and brave people that if you disgrace them they will never forgive you, and
  will never rest till they have punished you and revenged themselves."</p>

  <p>But Pontius and his army would not take the old man's advice, so he went
  home again.</p>

  <p>By this time the Romans began to be in great want of food. They had made
  several attempts to get out of the valley, but they were always beaten back.
  At last the consuls sent messengers to Pontius, to try and make peace, or, if
  he would not make peace, to challenge him to battle. Pontius sent back word
  that the battle was already won; that the Romans were his prisoners, and must
  lay down their arms, and all pass under the yoke; and that the consuls must
  promise that Rome would be at peace with Samnium.</p>

  <p>The yoke was made by planting two spears upright in the ground, and tying
  a third spear to their tops, so as to make a sort of arch through which the
  army had to pass. It was the custom at this time in Italy to make a beaten
  army pass under the yoke, and this was considered a great disgrace, because
  it showed that the army was completely conquered.</p>

  <p>The consuls knew that they had no power to promise that Rome would keep
  peace with Samnium; but they thought that if they did not promise, the
  Samnites would kill all their army, and they wished to save their men, so
  they agreed to do all that Pontius wished.</p>

  <p>When the Roman soldiers heard that the Samnite general had sent word that
  they must all pass under the yoke, there was as much grief and sorrow in the
  camp as if he had said they should all be put to the sword. They cried out
  against the consuls who had led them into such danger and disgrace. They
  thought how shameful it would be to give up their armour and weapons. They
  fancied how their proud enemies would insult and mock at them, and how sad
  would be their return to Rome, whence they had started with such joyful hopes
  of victory.</p>

  <p>"We," cried they, "are the only army in the world that ever was beaten
  without a battle&mdash;without a sword being drawn&mdash;who wore arms only
  to give them up to our mortal enemies without striking a blow; and whose
  strength and courage were good for nothing but to make us feel our disgrace
  more bitterly."</p>

  <p>While they bemoaned themselves in this way, the word of command was given
  that they should march out of the camp, each man wearing only one garment,
  and leaving his armour and weapons behind him. First, the consuls, having
  taken off their splendid robes and rich armour, were obliged to march under
  the yoke, then came the nobles and officers, and lastly the soldiers. The
  Samnites stood round jeering and laughing at the unfortunate Romans, who
  would almost rather have been killed, than have had to bear such disgrace.
  When they had marched out of the Caudine Pass, and had got away from the
  Samnites, they might easily have reached Capua, a town which was friendly to
  Rome, before night came on; but they were so miserable, and so dreadfully
  ashamed of being seen in such a condition, that they chose to stay away from
  the town, meaning to sleep on the bare ground, though they had neither food
  nor clothing, nor tents to shelter them.</p>

  <p>But news was brought to the people of Capua that the Roman army was just
  outside the town in this sad state. The Capuans were very sorry to hear it,
  and immediately they sent out plenty of clothes and food for the soldiers,
  and to the consuls they sent arms and horses, and splendid garments such as
  suited their high rank. When the Romans had eaten and clothed themselves,
  they marched into Capua. The people came out to meet them with their nobles
  at their head, and welcomed their visitors with kind words; they took them
  into their houses, and treated them like dear friends. But the Romans were so
  unhappy that all the kindness of the Capuans could hardly get them to speak a
  word, or even to lift up their eyes from the ground. The next day they went
  away to Rome, seeming more ashamed and miserable than ever, and not speaking
  a word as they marched along.</p>

  <p>Now, by this time, news of the great misfortune at Caudium had got to
  Rome, and the whole city was full of mourning and grief. The shops were shut
  up, the courts of law were closed, the nobles left off the splendid scarlet
  and purple edged robes they generally wore, the ladies put away their golden
  ornaments, and all the people showed in every way how great was their sorrow,
  for the disgrace that had fallen on the name of Rome. At first the people
  were very angry with the soldiers, and said that they ought not to be allowed
  to come into the city at all. But when the army arrived, their anger changed
  to pity; for the unhappy men came marching into the town at night, that they
  might not be seen, and each soldier went at once silently to his own house,
  and shut himself up there&mdash;so that for days after not one of them was to
  be seen out of doors in the streets. The consuls, too, shut themselves up in
  the same way, and all they would do was to name a dictator who should govern
  the city till other consuls could be chosen. As soon as could be, the new
  consuls called Postumius before them, that he might tell them about the
  shameful peace that he had made with the Samnites at Caudium.</p>

  <p>Postumius came into their presence, with looks as sad and unhappy as on
  the day when he had to pass under the yoke.</p>

  <p>"I know well enough," said he, "that you have called me here not for
  honour but for shame, and that I am commanded to speak as one who is guilty
  of a badly managed war and a shameful peace. I will only say to defend myself
  that I agreed to that peace to save your army from being destroyed. But I
  think that as it was made without the people of Rome knowing anything about
  it, they need not keep the promises that I made. Instead of keeping the
  agreement, give up to the Samnites the men who made these promises. Were you
  Romans ever asked if you would agree to the peace? Who can pretend that you
  have deceived them? You never promised anything to the Samnites, and you
  never ordered us to make any agreements for you. We are the men who promised,
  and as we cannot keep our word, we will give our lives instead. Give us up to
  the Samnites then, and let them do what they please with us, and in the
  meantime let the consuls raise and arm all the soldiers they can, and begin
  the war over again with better success."</p>

  <p>The senate and consuls were very sorry for the brave Postumius, but they
  and all the people could find no better way of freeing themselves from the
  treaty of peace to which he had been forced to agree. Every one praised him
  for being ready to give his life for his country, and the Romans were so
  filled with anger and so eager for war, that a great army was soon raised,
  and, with the consuls at its head, marched towards Caudium.</p>

  <p>Before the army went the heralds with Postumius and the others who were to
  be given up to the Samnites. When they came near to the gate of Caudium, the
  heralds told the soldiers to bind the hands of these men behind their backs,
  which was done. The soldier who tied the hands of Postumius felt such sorrow
  and respect for his old general, that he fastened the cords very gently and
  loosely.</p>

  <p>"Draw the cord tighter," said Postumius, "that the law may be obeyed, as
  is just and right."</p>

  <p>Then the heralds led him and the others before Pontius and the Samnite
  nobles, and said to them,</p>

  <p>"These persons, without the leave of the Roman people, have promised to
  make peace with you. The Roman people will have no peace with the Samnites,
  and they send you these men to do with them what you will."</p>

  <p>Pontius and all the Samnites were extremely angry at this, for they
  thought that the Roman people ought to have kept the promises that their
  consul had made. And after a while Pontius said,</p>

  <p>"Neither I nor the Samnites will accept these men, whom you pretend to
  give up to us. I do not blame you, Postumius, who, like a brave and
  honourable man, have come to give up your life as you cannot keep your
  promise. But if the Roman people do not like the agreement their consul made
  for them, let them bring their army back again into the place where we
  surrounded them. Let them take their arms again, and shut themselves up in
  their camp and let all be as it was before the consuls made the treaty. Is
  this your truth? Is this how you keep your word? You have your soldiers safe
  as I promised you; but where is the peace that you promised to me? I will not
  accept these men whom you pretend to deliver up to me; but I call upon the
  gods to punish you for breaking your solemn vows. Go, lictor, unbind these
  Romans, and let them go wherever they please."</p>

  <p>This was soon done, and Postumius and the other prisoners went back
  unharmed to the Roman camp.</p>

  <p>The Samnites now began to understand how wise had been the advice of old
  Herennius, when he told them either to make friends of the Romans by setting
  them free, or to kill them all. For the war that began again was fiercer and
  more cruel than ever.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE TWO FABII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Samnites had lost many battles in the wars with Rome,
  and the Romans began to hope that soon they might be able quite to conquer
  this brave people, who had fought for so many years against them. Quintus
  Fabius was now consul; he was the son of Fabius Maximus, a brave old man who
  had been many times consul, and had won many victories for Rome. Quintus
  Fabius was young and brave, and thought that, as the Samnites had been so
  often beaten, it would be easy for him to beat them again, and he hoped that
  he might have the joy and glory of at last finishing the war. So he raised an
  army, and marched to attack them.</p>

  <p>The Samnites, however, were a very brave people, and they did not much
  fear Fabius, knowing that he was young and had not had much practice as a
  general. They, too, got an army together, and set out towards Rome.</p>

  <p>I said that Quintus Fabius was a brave man, like the rest of his family,
  who have been called "the brave Fabian race." But he forgot that he ought to
  be watchful and careful as well as brave. As he marched through Campania, he
  came in sight of a party of soldiers sent out by the Samnite general in front
  of his army, to see if the way was clear for the rest. When this small body
  of troops saw the Romans coming towards them they retreated to their fellow
  countrymen. Fabius thought they were running away from him, and at once
  ordered his soldiers to follow them as fast as possible. Meantime the Samnite
  general, hearing that the Romans were coming, had placed his soldiers in
  order of battle, and was ready for the attack. The Romans came up, tired
  before the battle began, because they had marched so fast; their ranks were
  in disorder, and they looked as if they were coming to plunder and not to
  fight. It is not hard to guess what happened. The Samnites easily resisted
  the charge of the Romans, drove them back, killed three thousand of them, and
  wounded many more; and if it had not grown too dark for the battle to go on,
  the whole army would have been destroyed.</p>

  <p>Fabius did his best to get his men together again, and made them dig
  ditches and make mounds round their camp to defend themselves as well as they
  could in the darkness and hurry. But they had lost all their baggage in the
  flight, and here there was no food for the hungry, no comforts for the
  wounded, hardly even rest for the tired; for they feared that the conquering
  Samnites would follow and attack them again. They waited for the coming of
  the daylight in this miserable state, thinking that surely that night would
  be their last.</p>

  <p>"For how," they said, "can men tired with want of sleep, weak with their
  wounds, and out of heart with the shame of being beaten&mdash;how can such
  men do battle against an enemy who conquered us when we were full of hope and
  courage?"</p>

  <p>Fortunately it happened that the Samnite general heard that the other
  consul was marching against him with another army. This was not true, but the
  Samnite believed it, and thinking it best to be contented with the victory he
  had already won, he led his army away, and so Fabius and his troops were
  saved.</p>

  <p>The people of Rome were very angry when they heard that Fabius had been
  defeated, and they thought the disgrace was worse even than the loss of men.
  They had hoped that the war was nearly at an end, and now because of the
  consul's rashness and carelessness things were as bad as ever. The Senate
  commanded that the consul should come to Rome to answer for what he had done.
  But when he came before them the rage of the people was so great that they
  would hardly let him speak to defend himself. They felt that he ought to have
  been wiser, since he was the son of so brave and successful a general, and
  that he had disgraced the name of Rome and the name of Fabius by his
  rashness.</p>

  <p>The elder Fabius feared that his son would be disgraced and turned out of
  his place as consul, and he came forward before the Senate to defend him.</p>

  <p>"I cannot excuse his fault," said the old man; "but I pray you that you
  will not so shame me who have done some service to Rome, and yet more that
  you will not disgrace the family of Fabius which, almost from the building of
  Rome till now, has given so many brave men to serve their country.</p>

  <p>"And yet I would not have you pardon my son because of the great deeds of
  his ancestors; but I feel sure that he will yet do good work for Rome,
  because he has learned to love his country better than even his family. You
  have seen the worst that can happen from his rashness&mdash;but the good is
  yet to come which you may expect from a man of so brave a temper, and who has
  been bred up by myself, a master, as you know, able to teach him what a
  warrior should be. Many men have learned by misfortunes to be more careful,
  and so may he. If you will let him try again, what has been done wrong shall
  be amended. I will answer for my son to the people. I will go with him to
  battle as his lieutenant, and share his fortune whatever it may be. I am old,
  but I have courage enough and strength enough still to bear the toils of war.
  If I were good for nothing else, yet I could cheer our own men and terrify
  the enemy by reminding them of my old battles; and besides I can advise and
  direct the young consul. Did I not know my son's temper and feel sure that he
  will be ready to follow good advice, I should be sorry to risk the fame I
  have won in so many years of toil and danger just now when my life is near
  its end."</p>

  <p>The people felt that what Fabius Maximus said was quite true, and they
  agreed to what he asked. Everything was soon got ready to begin the war
  again, and the consul and his father led the army away from Rome. The consul
  was willing to do all that his father advised, and the soldiers were eager to
  show that they could do better than in their last fight. They trusted too in
  the brave old Fabius, remembering how often their fathers led by him had
  beaten the Samnites; and they wished with all their hearts for battle.</p>

  <p>The armies met, the fight began, and at first the Romans got the worst of
  it. The Samnite general, with a number of his bravest troops, surrounded the
  consul; but when Fabius Maximus saw his son's danger, he rode at full speed
  into the midst of the Samnites to rescue him. The Roman horse soldiers saw
  him, and feeling how shameful it would be if such an old man should dare to
  do more than they who were both young and strong, they followed him, and
  charged the enemy so fiercely that the consul was saved and the battle won.
  The Samnite general, who was a brave man and a good soldier, did his best to
  keep his men firm and to stop those who fled. But in trying to do so he lost
  the chance of escaping himself, and was taken prisoner by the Romans, with a
  great many of his soldiers, and many more were slain. The Samnite camp was
  also taken, and a great deal of rich plunder, and the two Fabii went home in
  triumph.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; HOW PYRRHUS FOUGHT AGAINST ROME</h2>

  <p class="first">AS years went on the power of the Romans grew greater. They
  conquered many of the towns round Rome, and made the people their subjects
  and allies. So year after year their armies went further away from Rome, and
  sometimes had to go quite to the southern part of Italy.</p>

  <p>On the seacoasts of southern Italy were many towns which had been built by
  Greeks, who had sailed over the sea from Greece, and made new homes for
  themselves in Italy.</p>

  <p>There was a quarrel between the people of one of these towns, which was
  called Tarentum, and the Romans. The Tarentines attacked some Roman ships;
  and the Roman senate, hearing of this, sent Lucius Postumius as ambassador to
  complain of the wrong that had been done. When he arrived at Tarentum, he was
  received with the greatest rudeness by the people. He tried to make a speech
  to them, but they laughed at his way of speaking Greek, and at his dress,
  which was a long white cloak or toga, edged with scarlet, in the Roman
  fashion. They mocked at Postumius and would not listen to him, and at last a
  rude fellow threw dirt at him. Postumius held up his white cloak stained with
  dirt to show the people, who only laughed the more.</p>

  <p>"Laugh on, Tarentines, while you can," cried the Roman; "soon enough ye
  shall weep instead; for I tell you that this gown shall be washed white in
  your blood."</p>

  <p>Having said this he left Tarentum and went back to Rome.</p>

  <p>The senate and people were very angry that their ambassador should have
  been so insulted, and at once declared war against Tarentum.</p>

  <p>The Tarentines soon found that they were not strong enough to fight
  against the Romans alone, and they resolved to ask help from Greece.</p>

  <p>Now there lived at this time in a country called Epirus, which was part of
  Greece, a great and warlike king, whose name was Pyrrhus. He was a good
  general, and he wished to win for himself a great name in war. He had a
  splendid army, and the Greek soldiers were then thought to be the best in the
  world. They fought in heavy armour, armed with long spears, and standing
  close together shoulder to shoulder; while the Romans, as you know, used
  short swords, and fought in looser order, that is, not quite so close to one
  another. The Greeks also used elephants in war, and these animals had at this
  time never been seen in Italy.</p>

  <p>The Tarentines resolved that they would send and invite King Pyrrhus to
  come over and help them.</p>

  <p>"These barbarian Romans," they said, "will never be able to resist so
  brave and skilful a king, with his splendid troops and his terrible
  elephants."</p>

  <p>Pyrrhus was pleased with the plan, and agreed to cross over to Italy to
  help the Tarentines. He made great preparations for war, and got together a
  large number of ships, some of which were vessels of war and some were
  transports, ships, that is, for carrying his soldiers and their horses across
  the sea.</p>

  <p>News was brought to Rome that the King of Epirus was going to invade Italy
  with a great army. The Romans knew that they must do their best against such
  an enemy. They got together several large armies, and even the poorest people
  were obliged to go for soldiers, which they had never had to do before.
  Troops and money were collected from their allies, and everything was made
  ready for a great war. Meantime Pyrrhus and his army arrived in Italy, after
  a very stormy voyage, in which some of his ships were wrecked. He went to
  Tarentum, and he had not been there long before the Tarentines began to be
  very sorry that they had ever invited him to come. For they found that they
  had got a master instead of an ally. Pyrrhus governed the city as if it had
  belonged to him. He shut up their theatres and places of amusement: he made
  all the young men soldiers, and punished them very severely if they did not
  attend properly to their drill. Many of them tried to leave the town, but
  Pyrrhus shut the gates and guarded them with his Greek soldiers, and so kept
  the Tarentines at home whether they liked it or not.</p>

  <p>When the Roman armies were ready, the Consul Valerius Lævinus led them
  against Pyrrhus. The king heard that they were coming, and he wrote this
  letter to the consul,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I hear that you are coming against the Tarentines with an army. Leave
  your army, and come to me with only a few men. Let me know what your quarrel
  with the Tarentines is about, and I will force one side to do to the other
  what is just."</p>

  <p>To this letter the consul sent the following answer,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We will not make you our judge, nor do we fear you as an enemy. We think
  you are impertinent to meddle with the doings of other men, and to dare to
  come to Italy without our leave. And we have come with our armies to fight
  you as well as the Tarentines."</p>

  <p>Then Lævinus led his army on, and pitched his camp on the bank of the
  river Siris. Soon afterwards he crossed the river, and the two armies met in
  the plain, on the farther side from the Roman camp, near a town called
  Heraclea.</p>

  <p>King Pyrrhus was a brave soldier as well as a skilful general, and he
  charged the Romans at the head of his troops. The Romans could easily see
  which was the king by his splendid armour, and by the bravery with which he
  led on his soldiers and cheered them to the fight. They tried hard to reach
  Pyrrhus, and he was in great danger, so that at last he gave his glittering
  arms and scarlet mantle to Megacles, one of his officers. He knew that if he
  were killed the Romans would win the victory, for the Greeks would not dare
  to fight without their brave king.</p>

  <p>The battle was long and fierce; the Romans were eager to win the glory of
  killing King Pyrrhus, and at last Megacles was slain. When the Greeks saw the
  horseman in the well-known armour of the king struck down, they thought
  Pyrrhus was killed, and were so terrified that they began to retreat. But
  Pyrrhus threw off his helmet, and rode bare-headed through the ranks that all
  men might see him; calling to the soldiers at the same time in a loud voice,
  bidding them look at him and see that he was alive and with them.</p>

  <p>In this way he so much cheered his soldiers that they attacked the Romans
  with redoubled fury. The Consul Lævinus, seeing that his men were
  disheartened, ordered his horse soldiers, whom he had kept out of the battle
  till now, to charge, hoping that these fresh troops would drive the Epirotes
  before them. But Pyrrhus had not yet brought his elephants into the fight,
  and now when the Roman horse charged, he commanded that the elephants should
  advance.</p>

  <p>The Romans had never seen these monstrous creatures before, and they and
  their horses were so much terrified that they turned and fled. By running
  among the rest of the Roman army, they put it into confusion, and in spite of
  all that Lævinus could do, they were forced to retreat across the river, and
  lost their camp and many men.</p>

  <p>A great number of the Greeks too were killed, and when Pyrrhus found how
  many of his soldiers had died he said,</p>

  <p>"If I gain another victory such as this, I shall have to go home without a
  man left me."</p>

  <p>He went the next day to look at the field of battle, and when he saw the
  Romans lying dead, with their faces turned to the enemy (which showed that
  they had died fighting, and had not been killed in running away), he cried
  out,</p>

  <p>"Oh, how easy would it be for me to conquer the world, if I had the Romans
  for my soldiers!"</p>

  <p>He admired the courage of the Romans so much, that he tried to persuade
  those who were taken prisoners to join his army; and though none of them
  would fight against Rome, he treated them with great kindness.</p>

  <p>After this victory Pyrrhus marched up to the north, and at last got to a
  town only twenty miles from Rome. Here he heard that Lævinus had got another
  army together, and was following him from the south of Italy, while the other
  consul who had been fighting the Etruscans had now made peace with them, and
  was marching to attack Pyrrhus from the north.</p>

  <p>So the king gave up the hope of getting to Rome, and went back again to
  the south of Italy. The Roman Senate now sent ambassadors to Pyrrhus, to
  persuade him to take ransom for the Romans who had been taken prisoners.
  Among these ambassadors was Caius Fabricius, a very noble Roman, who was well
  known as a brave soldier and a good man.</p>

  <p>When the ambassadors came to the king, Pyrrhus said to them,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I like not what you propose to me. You would have me give you up my
  prisoners, and if I do so, you will use them to fight against me again; and
  you offer me money in exchange. Now, I am not so poor as to want money from
  the Romans. I would rather be friends with them and give them money. Make
  peace with me, and you shall have my prisoners back without ransom, and I
  will give you rich presents besides."</p>

  <p>Then the king said he wished to talk alone with Fabricius, and when they
  were by themselves he spoke to him thus:</p>

  <p>"I wish to have all the Romans for my friends, but you, Fabricius, more
  than any of the others; for I have heard how noble and brave you are. I hear,
  however, that you are very poor. This must not be, and I will give you so
  much gold that you shall be richer than any other Roman. For I think it is
  fitting for a prince to enrich great men who are poor, and who love honour
  more than money. I only ask in return that you should persuade the Roman
  senate to make peace with me. And, when this is done, if you will go home
  with me to Epirus I will make you my dearest friend and the greatest man next
  to myself in Greece."</p>

  <p>Then Fabricius answered the king:</p>

  <p>"If I am said to be skilful in war or in other things, I need say no more
  about it, or about my being poor, as you have heard these things from other
  men. It is true that I have only a small cottage and a piece of land, where I
  live by working with my own hands. Yet, if you think that, because I am poor,
  I am worse off than any other Roman, you are greatly mistaken. I am a leader
  of my people in war. I am chosen by them to rule them, or to go as their
  ambassador. What does it matter to me that I am poor, while I do my duty to
  my country in such ways as these?</p>

  <p>"When I compare myself with rich men, I think myself happy. My piece of
  land gives me all that I want. My hard work makes me sleep well, and care
  little what sort of food I eat; if my clothes are warm, I do not want them to
  be fine. So, poor as I am, I think myself richer than you. For though you
  were master of Epirus, you could not be satisfied without taking Italy
  too.</p>

  <p>"I have been consul, and have led the Roman armies against the Lucanians
  and other peoples. I took their rich towns and won great spoils from them;
  and after paying the soldiers and all the cost of the war, I put the rest of
  the money into the public treasury. Since I would not make myself rich when I
  might have done so rightly and honourably, do you think I will now take
  bribes and presents from a foreign enemy?"</p>

  <p>Pyrrhus went on to make Fabricius still larger offers, but the Roman only
  answered:</p>

  <p>"If you think me an honest man, why do you try to bribe me? If you think
  me dishonest, why do you want to gain me?"</p>

  <p>So Fabricius went away. But two days afterwards Pyrrhus sent for him
  again. While they were talking, Pyrrhus gave a signal; a curtain was drawn
  back, and Fabricius saw a great elephant which had been put behind it by the
  king's order. The elephant lifted its trunk up over the Roman's head, and
  roared fiercely; but Fabricius only turned to Pyrrhus, and said with a
  smile:</p>

  <p>"Your gold could not buy me yesterday, and your elephant cannot frighten
  me to-day."</p>

  <p>Pyrrhus was much pleased with the courage of Fabricius, and he allowed the
  Romans, whom he had taken prisoners, to go back to Rome to pay visits to
  their families. For the king trusted to the word of Fabricius, who promised
  that all these prisoners would come back to him when they had seen their
  friends in Rome. And so honest and truthful were the Romans in those times,
  that every man of them came back on the day that had been fixed.</p>

  <p>Still the Senate would make no peace with Pyrrhus while he stayed in
  Italy; and the next year another great battle was fought at a place called
  Asculum, in which the Romans were again beaten. But they fought so fiercely
  that Pyrrhus said when the battle was over:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If I have to conquer the Romans again in such a battle as this, I shall
  be quite undone."</p>

  <p>There was no more fighting that year; but next year Fabricius was chosen
  consul, and he and his fellow consul, Quintus Æmilius, took the command of
  the Roman army. Pyrrhus, hearing this, led out his army against them, and
  encamped not far from the place where the consuls had pitched their camp.</p>

  <p>One day a Greek slave belonging to Pyrrhus came to Fabricius, and asked to
  see him alone.</p>

  <p>"I come to make you an offer," he said. "If the Roman senate will pay me
  well, I will give poison to King Pyrrhus in his wine cup, and so he shall die
  and trouble Rome no more."</p>

  <p>Fabricius was shocked at the wickedness of the slave, and he wrote a
  letter to Pyrrhus telling him of the plot.</p>

  <p>"You seem," wrote Fabricius, "to judge very ill both of your friends and
  enemies, for you make war on good and true men, and trust traitors and
  villains. We send you word of this plot, lest your death should bring
  disgrace on us&mdash;lest it should be thought that we wanted to end the war
  by letting you be killed, if we could not end it by our valour."</p>

  <p>When Pyrrhus read this letter, he cried out&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Noble Fabricius! It would be easier to turn the sun out of his course
  than to make Fabricius do a wrong thing."</p>

  <p>After these things Pyrrhus left Italy and made war in Sicily, where he
  stayed for three years. He then came back to Italy, meaning to try once more
  to conquer Rome.</p>

  <p>Manlius Curius Dentatus was chosen consul when the news reached Rome that
  Pyrrhus was marching again to attack them. He at once began to collect an
  army; but the people were afraid to go as soldiers when they heard that the
  terrible king of Epirus was coming against them once more. Curius saw their
  fear, and when the first man refused to answer to his name, the consul
  ordered that he should be sold for a slave; "for," said he, "Rome does not
  want a son who is not obedient."</p>

  <p>His commands were obeyed, and the people were now eager to join the army,
  fearing lest he should treat them in the same way. So the legions were soon
  filled up, and the consul marched to meet the enemy.</p>

  <p>Curius placed his army on some hills near the town of Beneventum, and
  Pyrrhus marched into the plain at the foot of the hills in the night. When
  morning came, the Romans were surprised to see the Greeks so near. Curius at
  once led his soldiers out of their camp and charged the foremost of the
  Greeks, put them to flight, and took several of their elephants. Delighted
  with this success, he led the Romans down into the plain, and attacked the
  main body of the king's army.</p>

  <p>The army of Pyrrhus was very different now from what it had been when he
  first came to Italy. Most of his brave Epirot soldiers who had fought with
  him in many battles both in Greece and Italy had been killed, and instead of
  them he had filled his ranks with new men.</p>

  <p>The Romans fought bravely, and after a while the Greeks began to give way.
  Pyrrhus saw this and brought up his elephants, but the Romans no longer
  feared them. They had found out that these animals are afraid of fire, and
  they had got ready bundles of sticks dipped in pitch, which they lighted and
  threw on to the backs of the elephants or into the little towers in which the
  people sat who rode on the creatures.</p>

  <p>The elephants, being frightened by the burning sticks, and hurt by the
  wounds the Romans gave them with their swords and spears, turned round and
  ran among the Greeks, trampling down and killing a great many of them, and
  putting the rest into great confusion.</p>

  <p>So ended the battle. Great numbers of the Greeks were killed, many were
  taken prisoners, and the rest, with Pyrrhus himself, fled to Tarentum. The
  king at once left Italy and sailed away to Greece, where he was killed not
  long afterwards.</p>

  <p>The Senate ordered that Curius should enter the city in triumph, and never
  had there been so glorious a sight in Rome as was seen that day. The houses
  were gaily decked with wreaths of flowers and green boughs; every window was
  filled with eager faces, and the streets were thronged with joyful crowds,
  all watching to see the great procession pass by. We may fancy how glad were
  the hearts of the Roman people when they thought that the terrible Greeks
  were conquered, and how grateful they felt to the brave soldiers who had
  borne hardship and danger, and risked death for the sake of Rome.</p>

  <p>First in the procession walked the senators who had gone to the gates of
  the city to meet the victors. Then, guarded by Roman soldiers, came the
  spoils taken from the enemy, piled on high waggons or carried by men.
  Beautiful pictures and statues, splendid robes and stuffs of bright colours,
  armour adorned with gold and jewels, all sorts of beautiful things which were
  used and made by the skilful Greeks, but such as had never been seen before
  by the rougher, simpler people of Rome, were there. There too were seen for
  the first time in Rome those strange and terrible elephants, of which they
  had heard so much in the war. What surprise must the people have felt at the
  great creatures, their vast size, their strange snake-like trunks, the
  castles on their backs, in which several soldiers could sit, and the
  gentleness which made it possible to lead them through the crowded
  streets.</p>

  <p>Then came the long line of prisoners, some of them soldiers from the towns
  of southern Italy, such as had often, no doubt, been seen in Rome before. But
  besides these there were the Greeks of Pyrrhus, his foot soldiers, the finest
  in the world, and his gallant horse soldiers, whose looks and dress and arms
  were all strange to the eyes of the people of Rome. When these had passed,
  the general's lictors marched by one after another, their fasces, or bundles
  of rods and axes, wreathed with laurel boughs. Then came the triumphal car,
  drawn by four beautiful horses, in which was Curius himself. He wore a
  splendid mantle or toga embroidered with gold, and was crowned with a laurel
  wreath, and in his right hand he carried a laurel bough. Behind him rode his
  chief officers, and the rest of the army followed, with laurel garlands
  twisted round their spears, singing and shouting the praises of their
  leader.</p>

  <p>The procession moved slowly through the crowded streets and up to the
  Capitol, where Curius laid his laurel wreath at the feet of the statue of
  Jove, and thanked the god for the victory that he had given to Rome.</p>
