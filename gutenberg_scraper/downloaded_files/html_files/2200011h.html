<p class="first">JAMES FRANCIS DWYER (1874-1952) was an Australian
writer. Born in Camden Park, New South Wales, Dwyer worked as a
postal assistant until he was convicted in a scheme to make
fraudulent postal orders and sentenced to seven years imprisonment
in 1899. In prison, Dwyer began writing, and with the help of
another inmate and a prison guard, had his work published in <i>The
Bulletin</i>. After completing his sentence, he relocated to London
and then New York, where he established a successful career as a
writer of short stories and novels. Dwyer later moved to France,
where he wrote his autobiography, <i>Leg-Irons on Wings</i>, in
1949. Dwyer wrote over 1,000 short stories during his career, and
was the first Australian-born person to become a millionaire from
writing. &mdash;<span class="smcap">Wikipedia</span></p>

<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The House Of The Dream Smoke</p>

<p class="first"><br>
TO the man who thinks that the United States of America is the milk
and honey section of the world, and that New York is the centre of
that section, there is no news that could be more distressing than
the knowledge that he is as far away from that centre as he can
possibly get. Chico Morgan made this discovery on the summer
evening that he worked out the geographical position of
Banjermassin. Broadway was as far to the east as it was to the
west, and Chico cursed softly as the home-longing produced by the
discovery bit into his soul.</p>

<p>"Just think," he growled, "we've got the soles of our shoes
directly opposite the soles of the shoes worn by the fellows who
are tramping up and down the White Way, and what is more, we
haven't got the money to get one step nearer home."</p>

<p>Chico's statement was the plain truth. New York was on the
opposite side of the world, and we were financially incapable of
lessening the intervening distance by a single league. Up before
our mental eyes came pictures of miles of electric-lighted streets
with whining trolley cars and goblin-eyed automobiles, and Morgan
thoughtfully doused the slush lamp lest one of us might notice the
suspicious moisture in the eyes of the other. There is no hunger
like the home-hunger.</p>

<p>After a long silence, Chico spoke. "Let's take a walk around,"
he said. "This room is like a furnace."</p>

<p>We stumbled down the rickety stairs and out into the narrow
street that appeared to be crammed full of the real extract of
gloom. The occasional lamp that blinked fearfully at a corner
seemed to fight for existence against the encompassing darkness,
and the houses were blotted out with the thick blanket of the
tropical night. Upon the little puffs of air that came prowling up
the Banjer from the Java Sea were all the odours of the East.
Smells of spices, of wet earth, bean-oil, marigolds, incense, and
burning punk came to our nostrils, and we longed with the longing
of the exile for the clean sweet smells of the home country that
was so far away.</p>

<p>There is a curious sense of expectancy in a tropic night. The
earth seems to be in a state of fever, and one waits for a change
with the anxiety of a nurse at the bedside of a patient. And that
peculiar feeling went with Chico Morgan and me on that night
through the streets of the old Dutch town of Banjermassin. The
dark, crooked streets were the abodes of mystery, and the whispers
that came from stoops and passageways where a mixed population
gasped in various stages of deshabillé, stirred us strangely as we
walked along.</p>

<p>"When I get back," stammered Chico, addressing a row of tamarind
trees that lined the street, "I'll never stray farther than Fort
George or Coney! Honest! I won't! These leagues of space that lie
between us and the Battery make me feel as if I had been sandbagged
every time I think of them."</p>

<p>"You'll stay about three weeks," I suggested. "Three weeks or
less."</p>

<p>"I'll stay the rest of my life!" he roared indignantly. "I'll
never&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>We stopped and pushed our heads forward. From a little dark
alley came the faint sounds of a phonograph, and we listened
eagerly. The instrument was sending into the spice-scented air of
Banjermassin a tune that set our blood tingling.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" growled Chico. "Do you hear that?"</p>

<p>"Of course I hear it!" I answered. "Some Dutchman has got a
bunch of American records, and he's entertaining his friends with
the 'Star Spangled Banner.'"</p>

<p>"We'll call on him," said Morgan. "It's possible&mdash;barely
possible&mdash;that we might find a millionaire from Newport who
has a yacht tied up somewhere in the harbour."</p>

<p>Chico turned into the dark alleyway, and I followed without
protest. The search for the phonograph and its owner would take our
thoughts for the time being from the contemplation of the films of
home scenes which memory unwound, and that was something to be
thankful for. Besides, it was barely possible that we would find a
countryman, not a millionaire, as Morgan suggested, but some
recruit of the American legion of devil-may-care that sits upon the
rim of the earth and whose members look toward God's Country with
the same reverence that the good Mahommedan looks toward the Kaaba
of Mecca.</p>

<p>The phonograph had stopped playing before we had taken ten paces
down the alley, but through the shutters of a shack, at the extreme
end of the passage, rays of light shot out into the night like the
white spears of crusaders, and Chico Morgan and I silently
approached the apertures through which the light was streaming. The
East breeds curiosity, and we had no compunction about playing the
part of Peeping Toms in our endeavour to find out who owned the
phonograph whose squeaky voice annihilated space.</p>

<p>The room into which we looked was an opium den of the lowest
kind. Chinese, Dyaks, Javanese, and filthy Hindus sprawled upon the
plaited fibre mats that were spread upon the floor, while
immediately beneath our peepholes, and so close that we could have
touched him with our hands if the spyholes had been large enough to
insert our arms, lay a white man.</p>

<p>There was no mistake about his colour. The attendant Mongolian
had just prepared his "pill," and the light from the little brass
lamp fell full upon his face. It was fearfully emaciated, the skin
hanging loosely upon the bones, while the long, lean hands that
clutched at the pipe appeared to be semi-transparent as he waved
them between us and the flickering flame.</p>

<p>For a full minute we had an undisturbed view of the place. The
small cheap phonograph stood on a raised dais at the far end of the
room, and upon this dais sat the Mongolian proprietor of the
outfit. The smokers were silent, except for the occasional
muttering of a drugged dreamer, but while we peeped through the
chinks in the matchwood and attap walls, the dead silence of the
place was shattered in a startling manner. A wild roar came from a
curtained opening at the rear of the dais, and next instant the
curtain was torn aside, and a whirling mass of fighting men was
flung into the big room. For a moment we could see nothing but
flying legs and arms, then our startled eyes gripped the meaning of
the tornado. A red-headed white man of tremendous proportions,
possessing the limbs of a Greek god and the fighting face of a
Viking, was battling his way up the room, and hanging to him like
wolves to a buffalo were a dozen screaming Chinamen and Malays!</p>

<p>Chico Morgan smothered an exclamation and pressed his face close
to the observation hole. A fight always interested Chico, and it
was a battle royal that we were looking at just then. That
redheaded man tossed the brown and yellow vermin hi all directions
as he fought his way toward the mat where the emaciated white man
fumbled with his opium pipe. My! wasn't he a fighter! That place
was a warren that belched forth assailants at the command of the
fat Mongolian upon the dais, but Redhead towered above them like a
battleship above a swarm of pirate junks. I thrilled as I watched
him. He was a mighty man. The arms he swung were such as Ajax might
have envied, and each time one of his tremendous fists crashed
against the head of a nigger, there was one assailant less in that
place of smells and deviltry. Right and left those screaming
natives got the sledgehammer blows, and the giant with the red head
roared defiance at them. He was a glorious fighter.</p>

<p>"Jumping jigsaws!" I cried. "Did you ever see such a man?"</p>

<p>Chico Morgan did not reply to my question, and when I turned to
search for him he was gone. I jumped back to the spyhole and
looked. Chico had forgotten Broadway. He had his big back to the
back of Redhead, and they were fighting like the Seven Devils that
guard the one door of escape that leads from the Malayan hell!</p>

<p>I am treasuring within my mind the memory pictures of that
battle so that I may warm my blood with them in the winter of my
old age. It was a fight that Homer would have put into jewelled
phrases. There were never two gladiators like Chico Morgan and
Redhead, and they swept up that room like a tornado, sending
Malays, Chinese, and greasy Hindus sprawling backward from their
punches.</p>

<p>The white man on the bench immediately beneath my spyhole stared
at the battle with opium-dulled eyes. Although he was only a few
feet from the hole through which I watched the fight, the screams
of the natives prevented him from hearing the insane yells of
encouragement I shouted through the aperture. I must confess that I
had no desire to join in the fray at that moment, and I am unable
to give a reason. The manner in which those two were disposing of
their foes fascinated me to such an extent that I could not move
from the spot where I was standing.</p>

<p>The pair of giants reached the white opium-smoker, the mob still
attacking, but now somewhat wary of the four fists that smote like
the hammer of Thor whenever a body came within hitting distance.
The fat Mongolian proprietor was shrieking protestations against
the invasion and endeavouring to urge his henchmen to the attack,
but the half-naked retainers were none too anxious to clinch with
the fighting pair.</p>

<p>"Come on!" roared Chico. "Come on, you yellow scum! I'd fight a
million of you!"</p>

<p>Redhead glanced at Morgan, smiled like a big boy, then stooping
swiftly, he put his arms around the emaciated white man with the
opium pipe, and with a laughing cry to Chico he turned to fight his
way back to the door.</p>

<p>I came to life at that moment. Racing round the shack, I dashed
through the door and down the long room, shrieking to Redhead as I
ran. He understood at once that I was a friend. Very tenderly he
passed me the thin form of the opium smoker, and then with Chico
upon one side and Redhead upon the other we dashed for the
door.</p>

<p>"Pound them!" roared Morgan.</p>

<p>"Straight punches!" shouted Redhead. "We've got them
scared!"</p>

<p>Now as I write this narrative I am wondering which of those two,
Chico or Redhead, was the greatest fighter, and as I look back upon
that fight in the opium den, and the other fights when they battled
against greater odds than they faced at their first meeting, I am
in doubt as to which was the better man. I know well that Chico
Morgan would never admit defeat, but when I tell of the prowess of
the red-headed man we met that evening at Banjermassin, the person
who reads this narrative will understand that the two were the kind
of men who would have led their tribes to battle in the days when
the world was young. When we forget how to fight we will be on our
way back to the jellyfish state that we emerged from five million
years ago. Aggressiveness is life itself. The men who are fearless
are big men, and the good Lord never made two bigger men than the
two who battled back to back in the filthy opium den by the banks
of the Banjer.</p>

<p>As we neared the door a naked Kling sprang forward, a short
knife lifted high in his muscular hand. His evident intention was
to drive the broad blade into the thin white man we were
endeavouring to take from the place, but Chico Morgan thwarted the
intention. The Kling received Chico's big fist upon the jaw, and he
was lifted clean off his feet and hurled against the matchboard
walls with a force that shook the shack. Redhead unloosed a grim
chuckle, but as he laughed, the fat proprietor of the place hurled
a small teakwood table at the hanging lamp, and the wild mêlée was
blotted out by the darkness.</p>

<p>It was at that critical moment that the opium smoker came out of
his stupor. "This way, Lord Edwin!" he shouted, as he wriggled out
of my arms. "This way!"</p>

<p>The thin one knew that place like a blind man knows his bedroom.
Clinging to my arm and shrieking to Redhead, he reached the door
while the mob rolled over us like a wave. I wrenched the Dutch lock
from the thin boards, and with a head ringing from a blow with a
mallet, I tumbled out into the cool night air.</p>

<p>"Chico!" I yelled. "Here, boy! This way!"</p>

<p>Morgan came through the opening with a rush that sent me
sprawling, then the red-headed man battled through like a big
hippopotamus, kicking viciously at a sinewy Chinaman who clung to
his right leg. Round the shack to the alley we raced together,
Redhead and I supporting the smoker, while Chico discouraged the
advance guard of the foe.</p>

<p>"Can you run, Phillip?" asked the big man, stooping over the
rescued one.</p>

<p>"Run, Lord Edwin?" gasped the other. "No, I can't run! My
running days are over. Clear out and leave me! You'll get into
trouble for this business!"</p>

<p>Redhead ignored the advice by seizing the smoker around the
waist, swinging him to his shoulder as if he were a child, and,
with Chico and me at his heels, dashing into the soft night. A
thousand odours floated upon the heavy air. Punk and incense,
flower, perfumes and the sour odours of mudbanks made strata
through which we rushed madly, Redhead running with no apparent
effort and paying no attention to the gurgled protests of the man
upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>We zigzagged through narrow passages, splashed through wet
places where the water from the river had swamped the track, and
wriggled knee-deep in mud through a mire that threatened to engulf
us. Once we stopped for an instant and listened intently. From
behind came the faint <i>plap-plap</i> of pursuing feet, and the
big man cursed softly as he made a movement to lower his burden.
Chico understood that movement. He slipped back into the darkness,
and after a short interval there came to our ears a yelp of pain,
the quickened patter of bare feet in hot retreat, then Morgan's
returning footsteps.</p>

<p>"All right," he muttered. "It was only a Chinaman. Here, let me
lend you a hand to carry your friend."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Redhead. "He's no weight at all. He's light."</p>

<p>"Light?" chuckled the smoker. "Of course I'm light! Hee, hee!
I'm all smoke! All smoke!"</p>

<p>Redhead muttered something beneath his breath, and we ran on. On
and on we went, through the waiting night, through the dark
passageways, and as we ran we forgot Broadway with its whining
trolley cars and goblin-eyed autos of which we had been dreaming an
hour before.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The Wonder Chalice</p>

<p class="first"><br>
IT was the opium smoker who called a halt. Slipping from the
shoulder of Redhead, he opened a wooden door in a wall that was
'thickly covered with wistaria and Bougainvillea, and we followed
him into the inclosure.</p>

<p>"This way," he murmured. "Keep close to me." With Redhead
supporting him, he stumbled along narrow pathways bordered with
tropical flowers whose sweet odours half intoxicated us. It was a
place that naiads and dryads might choose for a romping ground, and
the silvery tinkle of fountains came to our ears with the drowsy
murmur of wood doves that our steps disturbed.</p>

<p>"Steady," muttered the opium smoker. "There are steps here."</p>

<p>Chico Morgan and I followed up the half dozen steps, and found
ourselves upon the piazza of a bungalow that was completely hidden
by the luxuriant tropical growth. And at that moment, just as we
considered the adventure at an end as far as we were concerned, the
red-headed man thought it an opportune time to introduce
himself.</p>

<p>"My name is Edwin Templeton," he said quietly.
"I'm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord Edwin Templeton," corrected the opium smoker, as he
fumbled with a key. "Lord Edwin Templeton, I say!"</p>

<p>"There are no titles where you and I are concerned," said the
big man, gripping Chico's hand. "You fight too well for any fool
prefixes to be between us. I'm plain Templeton, or Red, if you like
a shorter word."</p>

<p>Chico Morgan laughed the easy, unabashed laugh of the carefree
man as he returned the grip. "I'm glad there's no title," he said
quietly. "We're not in the habit of using them much out our way. My
name is Chico Morgan, and this is my mate, Jack Lenford."</p>

<p>"Americans?" asked Templeton.</p>

<p>"Sure," answered Chico; then, as if the question brought back
the attack of homesickness, he added: "And mighty sorry that we're
so far away from the home country."</p>

<p>The opium smoker, still protesting against the omission of
Templeton's title, had managed to unlock the door, and Redhead
motioned us to enter the wide hall of the bungalow. But Chico
Morgan demurred. The fight being over, and all danger of pursuit
out of the question, he had no further interest in the proceedings,
and he attempted to excuse himself.</p>

<p>But the Englishman had no thought of letting Morgan escape so
easily. He gripped Chico's arm as we attempted to back away, and
his heavy voice boomed through the night.</p>

<p>"Do you think I could have fought my way out of that place
without your help?" he cried. "Here! stop! Have you got any
engagements?"</p>

<p>"None," answered Chico. "We came down from Singapore in <i>The
Light of Asia</i>, jumped her here because he had a difference with
the mate, and now we're watching the horizon to grab the first
opportunity that will bring us within range of Sandy Hook."</p>

<p>Templeton gave a gurgle of joy, and his grip tightened. "I can
put you next to the opportunity," he cried. "Come inside. I want a
man or two, and by the Toe of Buddha! you're going to fill one of
the jobs."</p>

<p>He half dragged Chico into the hall of the bungalow, and I
followed. The place was lighted by a hanging lamp of hammered
silver, and the soft light fell upon Chinese embroideries that
covered the walls. Ebony settees curiously inlaid with
mother-of-pearl stood upon each side, while the curtain that
separated the hall from the room which the opium smoker had entered
bore a representation of Buddha sitting beneath a bo-tree, the
whole piece outlined with Burmese spinels that sparkled in the
lamplight.</p>

<p>The protesting high-pitched voice of the opium smoker came from
the room as Templeton reached the curtain, and then our ears caught
the sound of a woman's voice pleading with him like a mother pleads
with her child. The Englishman entered the room with Chico and me
at his heels, the look upon Morgan's face proving to me, if not to
Templeton, that he had an inclination to bolt from the premises.
Upon a couch at one side of the room was the opium smoker, and
sitting beside him was a girl of wonderful beauty, whose white,
shapely hand stroked the worn face of the debauchee at her side.
Although the haggard face of the man was different from hers as one
face could possibly be from another, yet the brows of the two, and
the whimsical expression of the mouth, peculiar to both, proclaimed
a relationship.</p>

<p>The girl rose quickly as Chico and I entered the room, and
Templeton introduced us.</p>

<p>"These are two good Americans who helped me a little to-night,
Evelyn," he explained. "Mr. Morgan and Mr. Lenford, this is our
friend's sister, Miss Courtney."</p>

<p>"And I'm Phillip Courtney," mumbled the man on the couch. "I
always introduce myself. By George!" he cried, turning to Chico,
"you're the greatest fighter, excepting Lord Edwin, that I ever
saw! Absolutely the best!"</p>

<p>The girl touched a bell, and a Chinaman answered the summons.
She instructed him to bring refreshments, and then excusing herself
on account of the lateness of the hour, she left the room, leaving
the four of us together. It was then that Chico and I had our first
good look at Red Templeton. He sat under a lamp in the centre of
the room, and the light fell full upon his remarkable face. It was
an extraordinary face. The eyes were clear blue, full of a boyish
innocence and brimming over with life and laughter, but the nose,
jaw, and brow gave a strength and fighting quality to the face that
told the observer that the laughter in the blue eyes was likely to
disappear at any moment that the fighting devil beneath the surface
announced that it was not the proper time for merriment. To me he
appeared a superman on that evening, and the impression has never
altered. A man too big for the petty conventions of the life he had
been born to, he had thrown that life aside and had wooed adventure
where Romance flies her flag of gold on the rim of the earth. His
was the true patent of nobility. He could earn his right to lead
his people by the tremendous strength in the big arms and the
hallmark of courage that one observed upon his face.</p>

<p>For about thirty minutes he plied Chico with questions
concerning our wanderings, and while we conversed, the half
stupefied Courtney lay upon the couch and muttered incoherently,
interrupting occasionally with a question or remark that was
totally irrelevant to the matter we were discussing.</p>

<p>"And you are open to an engagement?" asked Templeton, after
Chico had finished a recital of our wanderings.</p>

<p>"I guess we are," answered Morgan. "This burg has little
attraction for us."</p>

<p>Templeton surveyed Chico for a full minute, a half smile showing
about his handsome mouth, then he stood up, walked toward a cabinet
at the end of the room, unlocked it, took something from within,
and started back to us. It is strange that every movement he made
in approaching that cabinet and returning to his place beneath the
lamp is etched upon my mind by the tremendous happening that
immediately followed. The mind at moments of extraordinary stress
is peculiarly sensitive to impressions, and I recall now how
Templeton circled outside the light of a silver sconce as he came
back to us. He wished to produce the utmost effect, and he was
successful. Arriving at his seat, that was immediately beneath the
lamp, he flung back the flap of his coat that was concealing the
object that he carried, and we saw!</p>

<p>Now on a summer night when the smell of wet earth or crushed
flowers brings back to my mind that night in Banjermassin, I dream
for hours of the glory that we saw. I shall dream of it till I die.
Perhaps, like the Burman who asked that he might dream of the Shwe
Dagon Pagoda after he reached the paradise of the faithful, I might
dream of that for all eternity.</p>

<p>Chico and I thrust our heads forward when the big Englishman
drew back his coat, and we gave a joint cry of wonder that roused
Courtney from his stupor. Templeton's hands seemed to be holding a
chalice that sent out white spears of light into the corners of the
room, and we choked as we looked. There was never anything made
like that. Never! It was the most glorious thing that has ever been
created by the hand of man, and, while the world is a world,
nothing will be made that will equal that.</p>

<p>Chico Morgan broke the little silence that followed the gurgle
of wonder we emitted when we caught the first glimpse of the thing.
Chico stood up, made a movement toward Templeton, paused, and then
stood with both hands extended.</p>

<p>"The Chalice!" he cried. "The Chalice of Everlasting Fire!"</p>

<p>Red Templeton laughed softly as he watched Morgan's face. The
Englishman was pleased at the look of amazement that was upon
Chico's sun-tanned countenance.</p>

<p>"You've guessed it," he said quietly. "It is the Chalice of
Everlasting Fire!"</p>

<p>Body o' me! we had a curious feeling just then. It seemed as if
we had waited all our lives to get a glimpse of that thing in the
Englishman's hands. It was extraordinary what effect it had upon
us. We seemed to drink the glory and the beauty of it through our
eyes&mdash;drink it in to satisfy a longing that had asserted
itself suddenly. It seemed as if our souls had been waiting for a
glimpse of that wonder chalice, and that we had been in ignorance
of that longing till the thing had been thrust suddenly before us.
I suppose it was the stories of the vessel that had created the
subconscious appetite. In the peculiar atmosphere of the Orient
that chalice had lived upon the spice-scented breezes for
centuries. Lived, mind you! In the fo'c'stle of every blistered
tramp that hooted off nipa-palm villages in search of cargo, the
Chalice of Everlasting Fire was the subject of discussion. Men
talked of it on the stinking Wusung, whispered of it at the pearl
fisheries at Thursday Island, and dreamed of it as they looked upon
the snows above Darjeeling. It had a dozen names. Dyak, Kling,
Chinese, Jap, Tamil, Hindu, Shan, Khond, and Rajput knew it by a
name of his own. It was <i>the Vessel of Flame, the Holy Cup, the
Burning Pitcher, the Goblet of Life</i>, and a dozen other names,
but English and American sailors and rovers spoke of it as the
Chalice of Everlasting Fire. Somewhere in his notes on the Malay
Archipelago, Markham has alluded to the legend as an Oriental
counterpart of the story of the Holy Grail, and when we saw it that
night in Banjermassin, we had no need to wonder how it had led its
seekers to think of it as the miraculous cup of holy legend.</p>

<p>It was a high chalice of dull red gold, the gold that one sees
in old coins of the East, and circling around it from the stem to
the rim was a snake made of diamonds of extraordinary brilliancy
and purity. That snake was alive! As we looked at it, the light
reflected from one stone to another, seemed to run along the
serpent like a tremor of sparkling fire, while the glorious stone
set on the rim exchanged stabs of light with its counterpart set in
the very bottom of the cup. Mother o' me! it was well named! As we
looked at it we knew why it had been woven into the chanties of the
blunt-nosed tramps, the songs of the Malay pirates, and the nasal
war hymns of the Dyaks. We wondered stupidly how any one could keep
the whereabouts of the marvellous thing a secret.</p>

<p>It was Courtney, the opium fiend, who roused us from the torpor
which the sight of the chalice had brought upon us. The half-crazy
smoker lifted himself upon one elbow, glanced at the shining cup,
then burst into a fit of hysterical laughter that echoed through
the bungalow.</p>

<p>"Put it away, Lord Edwin!" he screamed. "Put it away! Take it
out of my sight! It's mine, confound you! Don't leave it there or
it will drive me crazy!"</p>

<p>Templeton pulled a screen between the couch and the table upon
which the chalice rested, and Courtney became silent. Red sat down
again and watched Chico. The white fire that seemed to be streaming
continuously up the body of the snake prevented us from moving our
eyes from the thing.</p>

<p>Presently Red leaned forward and put a question. "You know the
story of it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Chico wet his lips, made an attempt to speak, failed, wet his
lips again, and then whispered an answer.</p>

<p>"A part of it," he breathed. It was peculiar how that vessel
made one cautious about raising one's voice. I suppose all truly
magnificent sights, such as a marvellous dawn, a wonderful sunset,
a snow-capped mountain or a tremendous chasm have a quieting effect
upon the beholder, and that chalice had the same effect upon us. We
wished to observe it in complete silence, and Courtney's hysterical
laughter had jarred us exceedingly.</p>

<p>Templeton pulled his chair closer and spoke to us in a low
voice. "Do you know when it slipped out of the sight of white men?"
he asked. "I mean the last time it was lost to the outside
world."</p>

<p>"Over a hundred years ago, perhaps," answered Chico. "Is it
more?"</p>

<p>Templeton laughed softly and stepped across to the teakwood
table. Very tenderly he turned the chalice upside down and pointed
to an inscription upon the bottom. The letters were graved roughly,
but they were quite distinct, yet the words were unintelligible to
us.</p>

<p>"It is Portuguese," said Templeton. "Shall I translate?"</p>

<p>Chico nodded his head, and Red translated. The inscription
ran:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">TO MY KING, JOAM II, FROM<br>
ENRIQUE DE GAMA, WHO IS<br>
DYING IN THE SEA OF CHINA.</p>
<br>

<p>"And who was King Joam II?" asked Morgan.</p>

<p>"The king of Portugal at the end of the fifteenth century,"
replied Red. "He was on the throne when the Portuguese started to
send their old galleons around the world, and our friend, Enrique
de Gama, wanted to send this little present to him when he was
dying."</p>

<p>"And it never got there?"</p>

<p>"No; and it is the reason why it didn't get there that interests
us at the present. After Enrique de Gama died, his sailors ran the
ship ashore somewhere between here and the straits of Pulo Laut,
and do you know what happened to those gentle mutineers?"</p>

<p>"The Lord only knows," murmured Chico.</p>

<p>"They were taken prisoners by the Kyans, the Orang Bukkit
tribes, and the loot and the sailors were carried up into the
hills."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and," stammered Morgan, "who brought the chalice back
here?"</p>

<p>Templeton pointed to the wreck upon the couch.</p>

<p>"He did," he answered. "At least he was one of the two that
brought it back."</p>

<p>"And the other?"</p>

<p>"Is a Hindu. Courtney remembers very little of what happened to
him from the time he got lost at the headwaters of the Barito but
Gung knows. I'll call him."</p>

<p>Templeton touched a gong, spoke to a Dyak servant who entered,
and then flung a cloth over the chalice.</p>

<p>"Gung cannot look at it," he explained. "He knows its history.
Enrique de Gama gathered the loot from a Buddhist temple in
Kelantan, and only a holy man can look at this thing. Here he
is."</p>

<p>A Hindu, tall and muscular looking, with a long scar extending
obliquely from the bridge of the nose to the left jaw, entered the
room with noiseless feet. His beady eyes wandered over the
apartment, passed over Chico Morgan and myself, then, as if he
sensed the chalice, he fixed his gaze upon the cloth which
Templeton had thrown over it, bowed three times, and started to
chant softly in Hindustanee.</p>

<p>Red put up his hand to silence him but Gung could not be
silenced till he had made his invocation. When that was concluded
he was the servant again and he stood erect waiting for orders.</p>

<p>"Gung," said Templeton, moving closer to the Hindu, "I want you
to tell again the story of what happened to you and Sahib Courtney.
Tell it as you like. Sit down here and take your own time."</p>

<p>The Hindu pushed his chair as far from the teakwood table as he
possibly could, then with another bow to the thing beneath the
cloth, he started to speak.</p>

<p>I cannot write that story here. No one could write it and be
believed. It was marvellous, extraordinary, unbelievable. And yet,
although our so-called common sense tried to rise up and throw back
the statements that poured into our ears, our souls knew that the
Hindu was telling the truth. Yes! The story was beyond the
possibilities of imagination. No brain could build it up. It had
the props of fact beneath it, and we listened with open mouths and
throbbing hearts. The narrative dripped truth, and when the Hindu
chanted away in the stillness of that room with the little puffs of
wind carrying the old, old scents of the Orient to our nostrils, we
seemed to see everything that he spoke of. What a story it was! Now
and then as we tried to shake ourselves free of the peculiar spell
which the Hindu's words put upon us, the story seemed to rise up
and overwhelm us with its novelty and force. And the Hindu is the
greatest story-teller in the world. He creates a shadow effect
about his paragraphs and it is in the portions of his narrative
that he only half tells that the imagination can dive and drag out
wonderful thrills. That night in the bungalow in the Garden of
Dreams we heard for the first time of the Spotted Panther, of the
White <i>Mias</i>, of the Parang of Buddha, and a thousand other
matters that made the skin upon our necks prickle as Gung unfolded
his tale. It was a terrible story.</p>

<p>The Hindu finished as the gray dawn crept into the room, and
after a long silence, Chico nodded to the object that was
underneath the cloth. "And that is not to be compared with the
Great Parang," he said quietly.</p>

<p>Gung made a peculiar noise with his mouth, and rolled his eyes
in terror. "There is nothing in the world like the Great Sword," he
murmured.</p>

<p>"There is not," said Templeton.</p>

<p>Courtney woke at that moment, and he stared at us with stupid,
unseeing eyes. Suddenly he stood up and made a rush at the Chalice
of Everlasting Fire, and Gung, horrified at the thought of the
wonderful cup being uncovered in his presence, slipped from the
room with the speed of a rock snake.</p>

<p>Red Templeton took no notice of Courtney as the latter caught up
the chalice and hugged it to his bosom. Templeton was looking at
Chico, and Morgan read the longing behind the blue eyes as he
returned the glance.</p>

<p>"You are going up?" he asked.</p>

<p>Templeton nodded. "I'm all ready to go," he answered. "But I
wanted a mate, a fighting mate, and by the beard of Mahomet, you're
the man I want!"</p>

<p>He stood up and put out his hand, and Chico took it. They were
two big men, American and Englishman, and they had summed up each
other's worth. With the insane Courtney hugging the Chalice of
Everlasting Fire, they stood face to face and their grip
tightened.</p>

<p>Chico Morgan glanced at the chalice and sighed softly. The first
beams of the morning sun had found their way through the window,
and the snake made out of the flashing diamonds seemed to thrill
with life as the bright rays fell upon him. We felt sure that it
was alive. Gung had told us that it represented the Serpent of
Death that drank continuously from the Chalice of Life, and it awed
us at that moment. And Red Templeton and the Hindu had asserted
that the value of the Great Parang of Buddha was a million times
greater than the value of the Vessel of Flame. And we knew that
they spoke the truth.</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Chico. "The sooner we start the better."</p>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The White Mias</p>

<p class="first"><br>
WITH a desire to save the reader from anything that might seem of
little interest, I am omitting a detailed account of the nineteen
days that elapsed between that night of the fight in the opium den
at Banjermassin and the afternoon of the day we arrived at the
Place of Evil Winds. They were nineteen days of hard travel, but
there were few happenings in the time that were worth recording. We
had travelled up the Barito to its headwaters, crossed the
"lallang," or high grass plains, and had entered the jungle
fastnesses of the Tawah Mountains. Gung was our only guide and
authority. As far as we knew, Courtney, the opium fiend, and the
mutineers from the ship of Enrique de Gama were the only white
people who had ever travelled over that region. The interior of
Borneo is unexplored country, more inaccessible than the darkest
portions of Africa, and ten times more uncanny to the person who
braves its silent jungles and weird plains. Crossing the
grass-covered stretches our ankles were festooned with leeches, and
the pests became more troublesome as we advanced. The ten Dyaks and
Gung rubbed their ankles at intervals with the juice of the betel
nut, and Red Templeton, Chico, and I followed their example.</p>

<p>The Place of Evil Winds was well named. Whether Gung's
imagination was responsible for the name, or whether, as he
persisted, a man of the Orang Bukkit tribe had translated the
meaning of the Kyan word when he visited the place with Courtney,
we could not tell, but there was no name that could be more
appropriate. It was a section of gray desert, wedged in between
walls of surrounding jungle, and that spectral patch of sand was
dotted with round boulders that the Dyak carriers looked at with
aversion. The care which they exercised in keeping clear of the
stones in crossing the strip of desert provoked Temple-ton's
curiosity, and he asked a question.</p>

<p>"Why are they dodging the rocks?" he asked.</p>

<p>Gung, the fountain of wisdom, unbosomed himself. "They are
afraid," he murmured. "The fact of the rocks being here explains
why the breeze does not blow upon this place."</p>

<p>He pointed to the waving tops of the green walls of tapang,
mohor, and sandalwood trees that hemmed us in on all sides, then he
wet his finger and held it up.</p>

<p>"There is no breeze here," he said quietly. "The trees are
bowing to the south wind, but it does not blow in this place."</p>

<p>Templeton laughed. "We're sheltered by the trees," he explained;
"They act as a barrier, that is why."</p>

<p>Gung's white teeth glistened in a smile that expressed his
incredulity. "We think it is these," he said, pointing to the round
boulders. "The wind will not blow upon them. They are the ten
thousand sons of Prang, and they slew their father. That is why
they were turned into stone out here in the waste where the breezes
turn aside lest they will wake them."</p>

<p>Templeton looked at Chico, and Chico grinned. "Better leave them
alone," he said. "Their beliefs are in their blood, and all our
talking wouldn't change them a bit."</p>

<p>I remember that we sat conversing late that evening. Within our
brains the story that Gung had told to us that night in
Banjermassin was rioting madly. That Chalice of Everlasting Fire
was always before our minds, and a score of times upon the journey
we had questioned the Hindu concerning the great sword with the
emerald handle that was called the Parang of Buddha. There were a
thousand legends told concerning that sword. We had spoken of them
in the hot, still nights, and we prayed that Gung's bump of
location would take him back to the place where Courtney and he had
purloined the chalice from the cave that was close to the
<i>kampong</i> of the Spotted Panther. It wasn't a treasure hunt
that we had set out upon. We were searching for something that was
beyond price. The Great Parang had been plaited into the history of
the Orient so that it possessed a value that was ten thousand times
greater than the mere value of the gold and precious stones of
which it was composed.</p>

<p>"You cannot put a value upon it," said Chico, on that evening we
camped at the Place of Evil Winds.</p>

<p>"Value?" cried Templeton, as he crawled under his blanket. "If
it were possible&mdash;if it were possible, I say, to bring the
Great Parang of Buddha to Benares and lay it in the Mosque of
Arungzebee, there would be a revolution in India inside of seven
days! Inside of seven days, mind you! The news would have travelled
in that time from Calicut to Chitral, and from Quetta to Mandalay.
Great Scott, man! We could stir three hundred million human beings
in a way that would make them push the British into the Bay of
Bengal. And the British are my people! I'm a Britisher, but I must
go in search of this thing if it wrecks a dozen empires. I'm going
to get some sleep. We've got a big march in front of us
to-morrow."</p>

<p>I went to sleep and dreamed a dream in which I thought that
Chico Morgan and Red Templeton carried the Parang of Buddha to
Benares, but the British Government, hearing of the discovery,
bribed them to secrecy by making them princes of the Punjaub and
Rajputana, Sind, and Nepal.</p>

<p>Chico broke the dream by prodding me gently with the toe of his
boot, and with a feeling that something had gone wrong I sprang to
my feet. A moon, white and scared-looking, swung above the wall of
sandalwood and ebony trees, and everything was washed with a pale
light that made it possible to see across the stretch of open
desert upon which we had pitched our camp.</p>

<p>Red Templeton and Morgan were standing side by side, their eyes
fixed upon the ten Dyaks and the Hindu, who were kneeling in a
little cluster upon the sand.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I stammered. "What is wrong?"</p>

<p>Templeton's right hand was upon his revolver as he turned toward
me, while Chico held a Winchester ready.</p>

<p>"Do you remember Gung's story about the White <i>Mias</i>?"
asked Red.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered. "What about it?"</p>

<p>"Well, these infernal lunatics have got a notion that she is
near. We don't know whether Gung has been filling their heads with
nonsense, or whether the sight of some big orang-utan has unsettled
their nerves, but they're half crazy with fear."</p>

<p>It is strange how the mind stores a remark as if awaiting a
suitable opportunity of calling your attention to the wisdom stored
within it, and which you probably failed to see when you first
heard it. My mind played a trick of that kind upon me at that
moment. It recalled the remark of Hooper, an American trader at
Singapore, a man who had seen more than any other ten men in the
Orient. "Belief," said Hooper, "is only a matter of stage setting.
If you have the right atmosphere for a story the hearer can believe
anything."</p>

<p>Now on that night at Banjermassin when Gung told of the big
White <i>Mias</i> who came down out of the mountains with the
orang-utan legion to harry the Trings, the Orang Bukkit, Punans,
and other sub-tribes of the Kyans, we didn't pay much attention.
The story of the Chalice of Everlasting Fire and the treasure which
Courtney and the Hindu left behind them in the hills made the tale
of the queen of the orang-utans a minor matter, but when I stood
with Templeton and Chico watching those half score Dyaks and the
shivering Gung, that story took on a complexion that was totally
different. The fear which gripped the eleven seemed to come out to
us. Templeton and Chico, two men who had faced ten thousand
dangers, watched the surrounding jungle with keen eyes, and Red
cursed softly under his breath. The tops of the trees were still
waving slightly as if nodding to us, and we thought of Gung's story
about the wind as we looked at all points of the compass.</p>

<p>"That infernal Hindu has told them tales till he has put their
nerves on edge," growled Templeton. "Get them up, Morgan! They'll
work themselves into a state of hysteria if we leave them there
much longer."</p>

<p>Chico and I were just longing for something to do at that
moment, and we started in with a will to break up the cluster. But
the danger which the eleven sensed upon the air bound them tighter
than iron bands. A few hours before they had been quarrelling with
each other, but now when Chico and I attempted to stop their
infernal whimpering by dragging them apart, the enemies flung their
arms around each other, so that when we tried to lift one to his
feet, we were handicapped by the weight of the other ten trying to
keep him upon his knees. It made Chico as vicious as a bobtailed
viper.</p>

<p>"Get up!" he yelled. "You infernal idiots! No <i>Mias!</i> No!
It's a fool yarn!" <i>"Mias, tuan!"</i> they groaned. "Devil
<i>Mias!</i>"</p>

<p>Chico got Gung by the shoulders, and by sheer brute strength
lifted him to his feet. "Tell them that-yarn is a lie!" he roared.
"Tell them, you old fakir! Quick!"</p>

<p>"It's true, sahib!" gasped the choking Hindu. "It's all
true!"</p>

<p>Morgan shook him till his teeth rattled, but Gung wouldn't
contradict the yarn that he had circulated, and when Chico dropped
him to the ground he crawled to the ten Dyaks and snuggled in among
their half-naked bodies in a vain attempt to ease the fear which
gripped his heart.</p>

<p>"We had better leave them alone," said Temple-ton. "They won't
get their wits till daylight. When morning comes I'll give Gung a
taste of a switch that will stop him from putting over any more of
his yellow-press stories while we're in this neighbourhood."</p>

<p>We sat down upon a boulder and watched the fear-stricken eleven.
They writhed and twisted like a bunch of water snakes, each trying
to get in the middle of the clump, as if possessed of the idea that
the middle man could derive a feeling of security from the
knowledge that his companions were around him. And those movements
seemed to charge the night with a sense of dread in the same manner
that an impending thunderstorm affects the atmosphere. Red
Templeton felt uneasy, Chico hugged his rifle and watched the
surrounding jungle, and I heaped silent curses upon the head of
Gung, who seemed to be a breeding-ground for fear, the germs of
which he spread broadcast each time he opened his mouth. I have
never heard a storyteller like Gung. Every word he uttered was a
cloak under which Terror invaded the mind of the listener, and we
had no blame for the half score of Dyaks that he had made crazy
with his stories.</p>

<p>"Gung has started all the trouble," muttered Templeton. "This
mob will be in a nice state for marching to-morrow, eh?"</p>

<p>"I think it would be good business to shift camp now," said
Chico. "This patch of sand has something about it that they don't
like, and if we could move them on we might quiet them down."</p>

<p>"That's true," cried Red. "We'll have another try to get them on
their feet."</p>

<p>We struggled until we were exhausted trying to bring the natives
to their senses. Chico Morgan and Templeton dragged them to their
feet, while I tried to hold them there, but it was no use. Fear had
loosened the muscles of their legs, and again and again they
slipped through our hands and tied themselves into a knot of greasy
limbs that defied all our efforts.</p>

<p>"Give it up," ordered Templeton. "It's too late to move now. The
moon is setting."</p>

<p>"I hope this game doesn't become chronic with them," growled
Chico, as we went to our seats on the big boulder. "I'm as sleepy
as a sloth."</p>

<p>"Turn in," said Red. "I'll watch this lot for a while. They'll
get tired soon and they'll go off to sleep. You get a nap, too,
Lenford. There's no need for the three of us to remain awake."</p>

<p>Chico and I went back to our blankets, and in spite of the
groaning of the natives, we were asleep in half a minute. Sleep is
more powerful than fear. When a man has been climbing over rough
country for a day it requires something more than a feeling of
insecurity to keep him awake. We had no knowledge of the White
<i>Mias</i> outside Gung's stories, and we had the conceit of the
white race which made us turn a deaf ear to anything that was
beyond our own experiences. With the matter of the Chalice of
Everlasting Flame and the Great Parang it was different. We knew of
that cup. Every breeze that blew from nipa-palm <i>kampongs</i> and
lonely jungle huts carried some legend of the Wonderful Chalice and
Sword, but Gung was the first to tell of the White <i>Mias</i>.</p>

<p>It was the sound of Templeton's revolver that brought Chico and
me to our feet. It seemed as if we had been asleep only five
minutes, yet the moon had disappeared when we looked around, and
the sandy stretch that was named the Place of Evil Winds was as
dark as the Caves of Beli. We couldn't see Templeton or the Dyaks,
but the yelling of the natives made it easy to locate them.</p>

<p>"Where are you, Templeton?" cried Chico.</p>

<p>"Here," answered Red.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much. Something moved here to the right, and I took a
shot at it."</p>

<p>"Do you see anything?" asked Morgan.</p>

<p>"No, but I hit it. If you look out! Morgan! <i>Look
out!</i>"</p>

<p>I've tried to develop the mental film which recorded the
happenings of the two minutes that passed after Red Templeton gave
his shout of warning. I am afraid to put my blurred impressions
upon paper, but I must. If the moon had been above the horizon we
could have seen, but as there was no light we could only feel with
our skins and sniff with our nostrils.</p>

<p>All I know is that something came from the jungle in our rear,
something that swept over us like a wave of hairy bodies. Great
God! what a sensation of horror that charge produced! Our souls
seemed to shrink in terror from contact with the clawing, screaming
mass that surged over us, and each time a body touched us it
produced a physical revulsion that we had never experienced before.
That in itself was extraordinary. The touch of an orang-utan in the
darkness might well occasion fear, but the touch of that mass
created a sick feeling that seemed to be a terror of the soul more
than a terror of the body. Perhaps the atmosphere created by the
moaning of Gung and the ten Dyaks might have had something to do
with this, but I know that Templeton, Morgan, and myself
experienced sensations that were hard to analyze as we were
buffeted by flying bodies and clawed at by invisible paws.</p>

<p>Red Templeton fired twice, Chico three times, while I took a
shot at the rear of the wave after I had been knocked backward by a
collision with a flying body. It was when I fired that I saw the
streak of white.</p>

<p>It passed before me and the flash of Morgan's rifle revealed it
to me. And that flash of white that brought Gung's story to my mind
was the tail end of the procession. Stunned and stupefied, we stood
and listened to the thumping of heavy bodies on the sand, the
crashing of boughs as the wave hit the fringe of the jungle, and
then, as if the noise of the animals had prevented us from hearing
other noises, we woke up to the fact that the screams of the Dyaks
came from a great distance, and were gradually growing fainter.</p>

<p>"Where are you, Morgan?" roared Templeton. "Quick, man! the
brutes have stampeded the Dyaks!"</p>

<p>"They've taken the back trail!" cried Chico. "Come on! We might
catch up with them!"</p>

<p>Chico started running in the direction we had come from on the
previous afternoon, and Red Templeton and I ran behind him at full
speed. The Dyaks had stampeded. They had held their ground during
the early evening because they were in doubt as to which way to go
in order to dodge the thing they dreaded, but the moment the wave
of hairy bodies had struck us, they had fled.</p>

<p>We ran for hours. Now and then we thought we heard a yell from
the natives somewhere far in advance of us, but when we stopped to
listen, we could hear nothing but the sighing of the wind in the
jungle. Gung and his half score were on their way back to the
headwaters of the Barito, and they were making good speed.</p>

<p>"It's no use!" cried Red. "We've lost them."</p>

<p>He flung himself on the ground, and Chico and I stretched
ourselves beside him. We were exhausted after that run.</p>

<p>"It will be dawn in a few hours," said Templeton. "Let us have a
sleep and then get back to the camp in the daylight."</p>

<p>"Right," muttered Chico, and without a thought of the dangers
that lay in front of us or the arduous work which we would be
compelled to perform now that the carriers had deserted, we fell
asleep. The sight of the Chalice of Everlasting Fire and the
stories of the Great Sword had created a fever within our brains
that made us oblivious to dangers that would have disheartened us
if we had not seen the cup or listened to the stories of the Great
Parang. We could not turn back. An indescribable feeling urged us
forward, a feeling that mere treasure was incapable of bringing to
our minds. Across the China Sea were millions of people waiting for
the great blade that had been carried into the hills when the Orang
Bukkit tribes had captured the mutineers of Enrique de Gama, and it
seemed as if their longings to see the sword were pushing us into
the untravelled and mysterious land that stretched before us.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="chaphead">A Cross In The Jungle</p>

<p class="first"><br>
THE most wonderful dawn that ever stained the heavens greeted us
the morning after the stampede. Heavenly geysers flooded the
pearl-gray bowl above our heads with rivers of orange and chrome,
baby-pink and carmine, and we sat and watched the sight. The
mountains of Tawah looked like a fringe of blue chiffon tacked upon
the cloth of gold and orange which was flung across the eastern
sky.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Templeton, after we had sat for some twenty
minutes gazing at the sight. "That sky is mighty beautiful, but
we're close to something that is so wonderful that three hundred
million people will go insane when they hear that it is in our
possession."</p>

<p>We didn't need any further prompting. Dawn or Dyaks or anything
else could not pull us' from the purpose of the trip, and without a
word we started back over the ground we had covered when pursuing
Gung and the startled carriers.</p>

<p>We struck the camp about nine o'clock and as we walked across
the gray sand stretch, Chico pointed ahead to an object that lay
between the camp and the jungle.</p>

<p>"We've got one trophy," he said. "Look!"</p>

<p>We hurried across to the thing that lay upon the sand, and we
walked around it in silence. It was an enormous orang-utan, larger
than any we had ever seen or read of. The rifle bullet that had
ended his mad charge had struck him between the small eyes, and he
had fallen backward, the tremendous arms clutching at the sand in
his death agony. The big chest of the brute was covered with coarse
red hair that was fully eighteen inches in length, while the teeth,
stained black with the juices of fruit and vegetables, were showing
under the thick lips.</p>

<p>"A nice visitor to come hopping over one's camp in the dark,"
said Morgan, kicking the big carcass. "If you had turned up in
daylight, you brute, we might have kept our niggers with us. Now
we'll have to pack our own provisions because you had no idea of
social etiquette."</p>

<p>We cooked and ate our breakfast, then sorted out our baggage,
left what we could not carry, and turned our faces to the jungle.
It was useless attempting to cache what we could not take with us
as it was impossible for us to say by what route we would return to
the Barito River, and we guessed that the orang-utans would make
short work of a cache if we took the trouble to construct one.
Besides, we had a firm conviction that we would not starve while we
had ammunition, so we shouldered our packs cheerfully and walked
forward. Like Jason, of old, we thought only of the thing we had
set out to seek, and the pictures of the Great Parang that were in
our minds blotted out the dangers which lay in our path. Now and
then I shuddered as I looked around at the encompassing jungle and
thought over Gung's stories, but I am absolutely certain that Chico
Morgan and Red Templeton had no fear. No bigger men ever invaded
unknown country than those two, and I am sure that they had
forgotten the orang-utan incident long before noon on the day
following.</p>

<p>It was a little after noon when we made a discovery. Red
Templeton, in endeavouring to get a shot at a wild pig, dived into
a thick mass of sandalwood trees, and it was his shout that brought
Chico and me to his side. Red was standing still and contemplating
a rough cross of stone that stood in a tiny clearing in the centre
of the tree cluster!</p>

<p>The cross was about four feet high, built, excepting the
crosspiece, of small stones that had become moss-grown through the
years. The crosspiece was a single slab of sandstone that had been
roughly chiselled, and that, too, showed that many a year of rain
and sunshine had passed over it since it had been placed in
position.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed Chico. "Did any one Say, we're pretty
close!"</p>

<p>He looked at Templeton, and the Englishman nodded.</p>

<p>"Closer than we thought."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Chico. "Why, we might have blundered into trouble
if you hadn't noticed this. Gung must have made a mistake about the
distance."</p>

<p>"We might be miles away yet," said the Britisher. "Whoever built
this wouldn't put it up close to the <i>kampong</i> of the Dyaks.
This is, or was, a little private chapel as old as St. Paul's or
older."</p>

<p>It was peculiar what effect that emblem of Christianity had upon
us as we stood and stared at it. If we had come face to face with a
carven Buddha or a rude representation of a two-headed wood devil,
we would not have been surprised, but the lonely emblem of the
Crucifixion clutched at our throats as we walked around it. It
seemed to throw a peculiar atmosphere over the little clearing in
the tree clump, and it seemed to our startled eyes that it held
within its moss-grown stones the hopes and fears of those who had
prayed before it in that place of silence and gloom. It was a
splendid outpost of civilization, and in the minutes that we stood
silently around it, our thoughts went flying back to places that
were thousands of miles from that lonely cross.</p>

<p>Templeton examined the stones carefully in an effort to find
some date or word that would show whether the cross had been
erected by one of the mutinous sailors of the galleon of Enrique de
Gama, or by one of their descendants, but there were no marks to
identify the architect. He had built it, prayed before it, and had
gone the way of all flesh.</p>

<p>"P'raps the tribe has shifted miles from this point since this
was erected," said Chico. "The hill Dyaks are great wanderers."</p>

<p>"That's a fact," admitted Templeton. "We may be a long distance
from the goal. It's a pity Gung bolted with the carriers."</p>

<p>With our eyes upon the cross we circled it slowly, viewing it
from all points and wondering stupidly concerning the man or men
who had erected it. If they were the sailors of Enrique de Gama who
had put a dying message upon the bottom of the Chalice of
Everlasting Fire, the stone cross was proof that they had not been
butchered by their captors. And if it had been erected by De Gama's
men, it proved that they had not been close prisoners of the tribe.
The position of the moss-covered emblem of faith seemed to suggest
a desire for privacy on the part of the builder, since the century
old trees that surrounded the spot gave visible proof that no Dyak
village had occupied the site since the erection of the cross.</p>

<p>"But it wouldn't have remained in good order all these years,"
said Templeton, pausing to survey it closely. "Why, there's not a
loose stone around the base. If it had been built by one of the
Portuguese sailors it would have been laid flat unless it had been
cared for. If there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Red stopped as Chico gave a little cry of joy. Morgan was on his
knees examining the ground at a spot about twenty feet from the
base of the cross, and as we hurried to his side we saw the reason
for the cry. Templeton's argument was good. The cross would have
probably fallen to pieces through the years if others had not
looked after it, and when we stood beside Chico Morgan we felt that
we were on the point of finding out something about those who had
kept the stones together. Chico was kneeling beside a beaten patch
of earth about two feet square, and leading back from that patch,
stretching away into the jungle, was a faint trail!</p>

<p>That little track was hardly more distinct than the path which a
leopard beats to his favourite watering place, but we knew that no
animal had made it. The beaten circle at the end of the path told
its story. The person or persons who had worshipped in that silent
grove had walked to that little circle, contemplated the cross at a
distance, and had then retired along the trail by which they had
come.</p>

<p>"By George!" gasped Templeton. "What do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"That some one still holds the cross in reverence," answered
Chico. "Either some of the descendants of your Portuguese sailors
are familiar with its meaning, or the Dyaks, ignorant of what it
stands for, have set it up as a fetish. Some one has been in the
habit of coming here, and that some one has been here
recently."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by recently?" asked Templeton.</p>

<p>"Inside twenty-four hours," answered Morgan. "The tracks are
fresh. Feet in leather sandals, and small feet at that."</p>

<p>The big Englishman whistled softly as we stood and looked at
each other. We felt that we were on the verge of a tremendous
discovery, and we stared at the stone cross as if we doubted our
eyes. We could hardly believe that any descendant of De Gama's
sailors would understand the significance of the moss-grown emblem,
and yet there was proof that some one had been in the habit of
approaching that little pile of stones, standing on the bare,
beaten circle, and then retreating by the same path over which he
had approached.</p>

<p>Chico spoke after a short silence. "Were there any women aboard
the Portuguese ship?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Couldn't answer that," said Templeton. "There might have been,
but the betting is against it. Enrique was little short of a
pirate, I guess, and his boat would hardly be the place for ladies.
In those days, a captain who wandered into these seas came with the
intention of picking up all the loot he could get his hands on, and
he trusted to Providence and the fighting strength of his crew to
cut his way back to the west."</p>

<p>"It's a puzzle," muttered Chico. "How the
dickens&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A wild pig broke through the underbrush close to the spot where
the little path went burrowing into the jungle, scampered across
the clearing, and disappeared. Another followed, and Templeton
sprang behind a creeper growth that covered a stunted mohor
tree.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he whispered. "Some one is coming!"</p>

<p>We dived behind the green screen, and from tiny peepholes
watched the path. Some one had startled the wild pigs, and we
imagined that the person approaching was the one whose feet had
beaten the little path to the cross.</p>

<p>With straining ears we listened for a sound while our eyes were
glued upon the path. Now and then we heard the snapping of a twig
or the rustle of dead leaves, but we could see nothing. If some one
were approaching&mdash;and we felt certain that a human being was
near&mdash;the approaching one was not using the little path. He
was pushing his way through the undergrowth, and he was using
extreme caution in doing so. If the wild pigs had not alarmed us,
it is certain that we should not have noticed the slight noises
which came to our ears.</p>

<p>The little noises of snapping twigs and rustling leaves ceased,
and in the silence that followed Templeton lifted a warning finger
and pointed through his spyhole at a place on the opposite side of
the clearing. For a minute Morgan and I could see nothing, then our
eyes pounced upon the spot that Templeton had located. Thrust
through the foliage was the yellowish-brown face of a Kyan, his
beady, black eyes searching the little clearing in which stood the
lonely moss-covered cross!</p>

<p>The examination was thorough. As the sharp eyes passed over the
screen of leaves which concealed us from view, we drew back
quickly, wondering for an instant if the instinct of the savage
would tell him of our presence, but the next moment we were
reassured. The native stepped into the open, and we had a full
view.</p>

<p>He was a tall, muscular Kyan, wearing a <i>chawat</i> of bark
cloth around his loins, half a dozen fibre rings around each ankle,
and a score of shell bracelets upon the right wrist. He carried a
wooden shield, the front of which was decorated with some twoscore
tufts of human hair, and in his right hand he gripped the deadly
blowpipe. His thighs were tattooed with spiral designs that we had
never seen upon any of the coast Dyaks, and his body was streaked
with white clay, the streaks radiating from a charm that hung upon
his chest. Altogether he struck us as being a fierce-looking
specimen, and the bunches of human hair that flapped up and down
upon his shield did not impress us in his favour as he walked
forward.</p>

<p>He stopped when he reached the bare spot at the end of the path
where we had stood a few moments before, and he was on the point of
stooping to examine the ground when his keen ears warned him that
the moment was not opportune. With a single bound he sprang back to
his hiding-place, and we turned our eyes upon the path. And this
time we seemed to know that the person who regularly visited the
cross was approaching by the narrow path through the jungle.</p>

<p>If I live through the next century, I shall never forget that
first view of Nao, the Golden One. I couldn't forget it. She stood
in a frame of green, and for a moment we thought that she was a
wood nymph belonging to the dark woods of tapang and sandalwood.
Diana of old was never more radiantly beautiful or full of life. As
we stared, forgetful for the moment of the wild-looking Kyan who
had plunged into the undergrowth, we thought of her as the spirit
of the hills, the living embodiment of the good that was in that
uncharted jungle. She was a wonder woman.</p>

<p>Taller than the ordinary woman, she possessed, with the unusual
height, all the grace and suppleness of the jungle-born. She wore a
small <i>kabayah</i>, or jacket, cut low around the neck and barely
covering the breasts, together with a <i>sarong</i> or petticoat,
that was wound around the waist. Between the <i>kabayah</i> and the
<i>sarong</i> she wore, Dyak fashion, a dozen girdles of cane that
were so completely covered with tiny gold rings that none of the
cane was visible. The <i>sarong</i> was blue, a beautiful Venetian
blue, and it was edged with tiny pearls and turquoises. Her hair
hung in' two great plaits, while the black masses above her brow
were held back by a silver comb of native workmanship, in which a
ruby glowed like the eye of an <i>aintu</i>, or hill spirit.</p>

<p>The face of the girl was more beautiful than any face we had
ever seen. She was beauty itself. All the witchery and dreaminess
of the Orient were in the big dark eyes that were deeper than the
whirlpool of San Larn. The nose was exquisitely modelled, the lips
redder than the blush upon Mount Pemabo when the sun kisses it as
he comes up out of the Celebes Sea. By the glory of Solomon! she
was a magnificent woman. The sight of her gripped us like the
clutch of death itself, and we looked upon her beauty with eyes
that made the brain forget everything else.</p>

<p>Her two slim hands held back the green branches while her eyes
looked at the cross. Her nostrils seemed to be sniffing the air
like a mountain deer that suspects danger, and I know that in the
moment she stood at the edge of the clearing, like a perfect
statue, a horror lest she should turn and flee came upon us.</p>

<p>Chico Morgan gave a little sigh of relief as one of the small
feet in its curious sandal of pigskin was put forward haltingly. It
seemed as if the girl sensed danger, but that she was attempting to
throw off the dread brought to her by her skin. Slowly, very
slowly, she advanced toward the cross, and if we doubted whether
the person who made that path understood the significance of the
little pile of stones, the doubt fled from our minds as we watched
her face.</p>

<p>The heathen approaches his fetish with a look of fear upon his
face, but there was no fear upon the face of the Golden One. Her
eyes were the eyes of a trusting worshipper, and as we looked at
those eyes we seemed to see the girl's naked soul. I think we
witnessed a miracle just then. Up in that jungle that was more
inaccessible than the Gidi Desert or the slopes of the Nan Shan
Mountains, a woman was clinging to a belief that refused to die. As
we looked at her we thought of the three hundred years that had
elapsed since the Portuguese sailors of Enrique de Gama had been
taken into the hills as the prisoners of the Orang Bukkit, and we
seemed to read the past in the big eyes that were soft and limpid
as they looked upon the cross. We saw it all. Through the centuries
a belief had lived, and we thrilled as we peered at her from our
leafy shelter. One of De Gama's sailors or officers had erected
that cross in the jungle, and generation after generation had come
to pray before it. The knowledge choked us. We pictured those
descendants coming to that spot, drawn there by the germ of belief
planted in the subconscious brain, their knowledge of the faith
growing less with each succeeding generation. It was an
extraordinary happening. We stared at the girl in the clearing and
wondered as to her knowledge of the symbol that had been set up in
that lonely spot in the jungle.</p>

<p>The red lips moved, and a prayer as soft as the flutter of an
angel's wing went out into the stillness. Red Templeton's head was
thrust forward to catch the whispered words, and the look of
amazement upon his sun-tanned face deepened as he caught the
whisper. Chico and I glanced at Red, and we knew well that he
understood the language in which the invocation was couched.</p>

<p>Softly, ever so softly, the woman sent her little supplication
into the silence, and a feeling of shame gripped us as we listened.
The place was as holy as a church, and we were listening to the
prayer of a girl whose <i>kabayah</i> heaved and fell under the
stress of her emotions.</p>

<p>Suddenly Chico Morgan shifted his position. His right hand was
thrust through the curtain of green, his Colt shattered the
stillness of the place, and before Templeton or I could bring our
thoughts back to the incident that had preceeded the arrival of the
girl, the Kyan warrior stumbled out of the bushes and fell full
length upon the grass. We understood then why Chico had fired.
Although mortally wounded, the native made an attempt to turn the
deadly blowpipe upon the girl as he threshed around in his death
agony.</p>

<hr>

<p class="chaphead">We Take Another Partner</p>

<p class="first"><br>
IT was strange how the intuition of the girl enabled her to take in
the situation the moment Chico fired the shot. Probably she had
never heard the report of a gun in her life, yet when she glanced
at the Kyan clutching the grass in his death struggles, and then at
Templeton, Chico, and myself, she understood immediately. And she
understood more. Without one of us making a move to enlighten her,
she knew that it was Morgan who had killed the would-be assassin,
and with a little cry of thankfulness she fell upon her knees and
kissed the hand that held the revolver.</p>
<br>

<p class="caption">She fell upon her knees and kissed the hand that
held the revolver.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Chico blushed like a schoolgirl as he listened to the torrent of
words that fell from the red lips, and he turned helplessly to
Templeton as he lifted the girl to her feet.</p>

<p>"What does she speak?" he cried. "Portuguese, isn't it? Tell her
it was nothing! Don't stand and stare at her, man!" Red Templeton
jerked himself out of the trance into which he seemed to slip when
he heard the girl whisper her prayer to the cross. He fired a
question at her in Portuguese, and after a moment's hesitation she
answered it. Chico and I stood and stared at that vision with open
mouths as she spoke rapidly. That happening was something that
would amaze the greatest stoic that ever lived. We had struck a
link with the past, and as we looked at Templeton, we saw that her
words stirred him in a way that made us madly excited to hear them
translated.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Morgan. "Don't keep us waiting! Tell
us!"</p>

<p>The girl was still clinging to Chico's hand, and she seemed to
cling tighter as Red swung round upon us.</p>

<p>"By all that is wonderful! we've struck it!" he cried. "It's
amazing! She speaks a mixture of Portuguese and Malay, and I'll
swear to heaven she's a descendant of Enrique de Gama's
sailors!"</p>

<p>"But what does she say?" asked Chico. "Why does she point to the
back trail?"</p>

<p>"She wants us to clear out at once," answered Templeton.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Red took a glance around, then at the Kyan upon the ground.
"We're close to the <i>kampong</i> of the Spotted Panther," he
said. "Do you hear me? She says it's close, and she wants us to
clear out before he gets his eyes upon us."</p>

<p>"Does she stay there?" questioned Chico.</p>

<p>"Yes. Wait a moment and I'll ask her about the treasure."</p>

<p>Templeton opened his mouth to put a question concerning the
Sword of Buddha, but Chico clutched his arm. "Don't ask her any
questions about that!" he cried. "That wouldn't be fair play!"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Red.</p>

<p>"She is with them," snapped Morgan. "And we don't want to burrow
secrets out of her because we stopped the Kyan with the
blowpipe."</p>

<p>Templeton and Chico looked at each other, and the girl watched
them with her big eyes. And she seemed to divine the cause of their
little disagreement at that moment. It was wonderful. With a sudden
twist of her arm she tore the big ruby comb from the hair that was
blacker than the Jade Goddess of Sarm, and she thrust the thing
into Morgan's hand as she talked rapidly.</p>

<p>"Now she's talking treasure," said Red. "She senses the reason
that brought us up here, and she wants you to take the big ruby and
go back."</p>

<p>Chico smiled gently as he put the comb back into the girl's
hand. "Tell her we are not going back," he said. "We are going
straight ahead if there are a dozen Spotted Panthers in the way.
And tell her it will be better for her to break connections with us
right now."</p>

<p>"What's the hurry?" asked Templeton.</p>

<p>"What's the hurry?" repeated Chico. "We don't want to make her a
traitor, do we? Let her go her own way and we'll go ours."</p>

<p>Red smiled as he turned to the girl with the message. Morgan was
sensitive about receiving any information from the beautiful
stranger, but the Britisher couldn't see matters in the same light.
We had come up to that place with the intention of looting what the
Orang Bukkit tribe had looted from the Portuguese ship three
hundred years before, and Templeton didn't care how we got the
information as long as we got it.</p>

<p>But he translated Chico's message to the girl. We knew that by
the manner in which she acted after the Englishman spoke. Morgan's
hand was taken in a tight grip between her two small ones, and she
hurled a torrent of words at Templeton.</p>

<p>"She won't leave us," said Red, translating rapidly. "You won
her over by putting a bullet in the head of the gentleman who tried
to assassinate her. He's a Tring, and they're at war with the tribe
bossed by the Spotted Panther. This girl's name is Nao, or the
Golden One, and there are three others in the <i>kampong</i> that
speak Portuguese."</p>

<p>Chico tried to disengage his hand, but the Golden One would not
be shaken off, and Chico's tanned face reddened. I think the big
American would have turned and run away had it not been for the
fact that the stone cross in the grove of sandalwood trees,
together with the appearance of the girl, convinced us that we were
close to the Great Parang of Buddha, and the feeling stirred a
madness in us that made it impossible for us to retreat. The fever
caused by the discovery of the cross made us forget the affair of
the previous night, and it worked us up to such a pitch of
excitement that we were incapable of forming any idea of the
dangers that lay in front of us.</p>

<p>"If we are going forward she intends to stick to us and help us
all she can," said Templeton. "That is what she says. What's the
use of your kicking against fate? I've told her what we're after
and it doesn't surprise her. Why, man, she must be the descendant
of an officer of De Gama's. An officer, not a common sailor! I'll
swear she is! And if the truth were known, the best part of the
treasure that is supposed to be in these hills should belong to
her!</p>

<p>"There's a lot of sense in that argument," said Chico. "I guess
she's the rightful claimant to the most of it. That is, if we
acknowledge the right of Enrique de Gama to it in the first
instance."</p>

<p>We stood and looked at each other and the girl. Whoever named
her the Golden One named her well. There were depths in her eyes
that held all the glamour and wonder of the world. Saints be
praised! wasn't she beautiful! She seemed to be as old as the hills
and yet as young as the dawn. And she had the mystery of all women.
One would think that her eyes were the eyes of Helen, yet her face
had the purity of St. Monica's.</p>

<p>And she seemed to understand the matter that was in dispute at
that moment. I don't know how she gripped it, but I know that she
did. We have little knowledge of the inherited impressions that are
stored in the cells of the brain and we were ignorant of the
thoughts that welled up in the mind of that girl when she got the
first glimpse of us. She was looking backward, straining after
words that had escaped her, searching for memories that had been
lost through the years. God alone knows how she struggled to make
the hazy dreams seem real; to build up the bridges that made
connections with a past that she had been robbed of by fate.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sprang erect, made a rush toward the moss-grown
cross, touched it daintily with her fingers, then slipping back to
the spot where we stood she touched our hands in turn, as she made
verbal explanation to Templeton and signalled that he translate for
Chico and me.</p>

<p>"She says that the cross binds the four of us together," said
Red, half choking with emotion as he spoke. "Saints be praised!
what has this girl dreamed of in this infernal place?"</p>

<p>The eyes of Nao flashed as a phrase seemed to spring out of the
mental reticule into which words had fallen through disuse. She
opened her mouth to speak, lost the phrase, waited an instant, then
in exultation she seized Templeton by the sleeve as the forgotten
words were recalled.</p>

<p><i>"A cruz de Deus traz-nos todos unidos!"</i> cried Nao,
repeating again and again the words which Templeton had translated,
and pointing as she spoke toward the cross. And her voice thrilled
us.</p>

<p>The Golden One put out a little hand to Chico, and Morgan took
the small fingers, lifted them to his lips and kissed them. And she
stood like a princess while he tendered the salute. Breeding? Of
course there was breeding! I'll wager that some of the bluest blood
in old Portugal was with Enrique de Gama, and that blood showed in
the actions of the girl, who was fairer than the houris who wait to
open the door of the Mahommedan paradise. She swept us off our feet
at that moment. She was our kin, and by the bones of Tamerlane she
seemed to become regal when she spoke to us. If we had met her on
the Praco do Rocio at Lisbon in conventional dress we should have
thought her some blue-blooded beauty from the big houses on the
Avenida da Liberdade. If Enrique de Gama hadn't any aristocratic
names on his register, we guessed that the long-dead Portuguese,
from whom Nao was descended, must have shipped under an alias.</p>

<p><i>"Nos somos amigos,"</i> she murmured.</p>

<p>"She is asking if we will be friends," said Templeton.</p>

<p>"Friends?" repeated Chico. "Ay! till we die! And we'll get the
Parang of Buddha and all the other loot, and you'll share in it.
And we'll take you back to where you belong. We will! Back to the
lemon and the orange groves of Lisbon and the moonlit nights and
the tinkling guitars. By the powers above we will!"</p>

<p>That girl seemed to know what he said before Templeton explained
a word of it. I guess she read it in Chico's eyes, that were mighty
moist at that moment. Her <i>kabayah</i> heaved as if the longings
of years would burst her little heart, and her smile was something
that no artist in the world could put on canvas.</p>

<p>That seemed a rather big boast of Chico Morgan's when one
considered the magnitude of the job that lay in front of us, but
Chico never looked at the size of a proposition he attempted to
handle. He looked instead into his own breast to see if he had a
conviction that he was going to win, and if he had that feeling,
the size of the job didn't matter. And he had a firm belief that we
were going to recover some of the wonderful loot of which Gung had
spoken as we sat and stared at the Chalice of Everlasting Fire.
Chico had faced death a thousand times, and the stories that he had
heard concerning the might of the Spotted Panther had no terrors
for him. Nor had Red Templeton any fear. It is the big shoulders
that are picked to carry the big burdens, and the girl seemed to
feel the confidence possessed by Templeton and Morgan as she stood
and looked at them.</p>

<p>"Leesbon!" whispered the Golden One. "Leesbon!"</p>

<p>"Ay! Lisbon!" cried Chico. "Does it sound familiar? Why the name
has stuck in her mind like a date seed in a pudding. Ask her,
Templeton, if she remembers anything that her people told her."</p>

<p>Red put the question, and the Golden One stood for a moment
thinking. Then she burst forth in the sweetest little melody that
we had ever listened to. It was a Portuguese love song, and as she
warbled it, we seemed to sniff the fragrance of the fruit groves
along the Tagus, and hear the tinkling of the mandolins and the
swish of the dancing girls. That song had been improved during the
three hundred years it had been sung up in those fastnesses. All
the longing brought by years of exile had been plaited into it, and
it tugged at the heart with chains of steel. And the desire for the
home that she was ignorant of was in the blood of the singer, who
had the eyes of wonder and the face of the dawn.</p>

<p>For a few moments after she had finished singing we did not
speak, then the girl led each of us to the moss-grown cross and
made us touch it with our right hands. Thus was our partnership
sealed and signed.</p>

<p>"Now," said Templeton, "we'll be moving on. The afternoon is
closing in."</p>

<p>Nao smiled at Chico, stepped forward along the path by which she
had come, and we followed without a moment's hesitation. We had
implicit faith in her from the moment we first saw her. Treachery
had no place in her make-up, and our brains rioted with thoughts of
the Parang of Buddha as we followed her through the jungle. We were
close to it, and the knowledge had an effect upon us that would be
impossible for us to explain. No amount of ordinary treasure trove
could produce the thrills we experienced. As we followed her
silently we pictured the three hundred millions of India, and the
other millions scattered through Tibet, China, and Japan, rising up
to greet the marvellous sword that we would carry again into the
light.</p>

<p>We had gorgeous dreams as we tramped along behind the girl. She
was a dream herself. As we looked at the masses of black hair, and
the <i>kabayah</i> and the blue <i>sarong</i> with its trimming of
seed pearls and turquoises, we built up dreams of golden mist that
reached to the stars. We stood upon the stilts of our imagination
and spun visions with our heads in the spindrift of the whirling
planets. We could laugh at Jason, Marco Polo, Pizarro, and every
other treasure hunter that ever went into the unknown. We were
close to the biggest treasure that the world had ever heard of, a
treasure that was above values, because all the money in the world
could not produce a thousandth part of the thrills which its
discovery would bring to the waiting Orient. We walked on air. We
forgot everything but the words of the Hindu in which he had
described what he had seen through the cleft in the rock on the
night when he had appropriated the Chalice of Everlasting Fire.</p>

<p>Once when I had made a whispered remark to Chico concerning the
stampede of the previous evening, Morgan looked at me in the manner
of a man who is trying to recall something that has been blotted
out by more recent happenings. And there was enough in the
happenings of the morning to blot out the incident of the night
previous when the orang-utan legion had terrorized the Dyak
carriers.</p>

<p>That lone cross in the jungle came up before our minds a
thousand times, and our thoughts went back to it as if we
considered it a friend in that wilderness.</p>

<p>It was near sunset when the Golden One called a halt. Very
cautiously she drew aside the green screen of vines immediately in
front of the spot where she was standing, and then, one by one, she
invited us to look. And we looked through that spyhole with
feelings of wild amazement. Stretching out before us was the most
ungodly quaking morass that we had ever seen. It was a terrible
place. The great, slimy stretch was studded with patches of green
that shivered like half-frozen jellies, and as we watched those
shivering mouths we could hear the morass gurgling softly as if
asking for something for its quaking stomach. It was a horrible,
fear-inspiring place, and it brought upon me a feeling of nausea as
I stared at it.</p>

<p>The girl spoke to Templeton and Red translated. "She says it is
the Million Mouths of Boorsh," he said. "In those copper-coloured
slopes on the other side is the <i>kampong</i> of the Spotted
Panther."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The Mouths Of Boorsh</p>

<p class="first"><br>
IT is the immobility of a morass that terrorizes the onlooker. Man
has never feared anything that is full of life. He loves the sea,
and if we can judge by sailors' chanties, the love grows greater
the more old Neptune disturbs his domain. But a slimy morass
conjures up visions of the crocodile waiting motionless for its
prey, of the horned viper of the Sahara that buries itself in the
sand with only the head visible to the traveller. I know that we
had unpleasant thoughts as we looked at the stretch of slime with
the strange green mouths that were scarce a yard from each other. A
million mouths! Why the place had a trillion, and as we stared at
them they seemed to shake gently as if a devil within the mass of
jelly was laughing at our discomfiture at finding such an
obstruction in our path.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" muttered Morgan. "That looks poisonous!"</p>

<p>"It's an unwholesome looking spot," said Templeton.</p>

<p>"And what are we to do now?" asked Chico. "Will you
inquire?"</p>

<p>The Golden One spoke volubly as Red questioned her, and he
turned to us with the information.</p>

<p>"There's a secret track across the place," he said. "We must
stay here till the moon comes up. She must leave us now, but she
will come back and pilot us across."</p>

<p>"Why can't we go now?" asked Morgan.</p>

<p>"There are watchers among the rocks on the other side. We
couldn't get close in the daytime."</p>

<p>"And won't they be around just as plentiful when we cross?"
questioned Chico.</p>

<p>"No," said Templeton; "they've got the same complaint that Gung
and the carriers suffered from. They're afraid of the White
<i>Mias</i>."</p>

<p>Chico opened his mouth to speak, stopped, and turned toward the
swamp. We were watching, too. Something was crashing through the
underbrush, and as we stared, a small boar broke from the jungle
with a larger animal of the same species hard upon its track. The
foam-flecked brute in the lead was out on the morass before he
seemed to realize his position, and the pursuer was so blind with
rage that he followed madly.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" cried Morgan. "Look how those green patches shiver!"</p>

<p>The pursued boar attempted to make a dash for the bank, but his
antagonist headed him off. Grunting loudly, the fugitive made a
sudden turn to go back over the ground that he had covered, but one
of the mouths was ready for that turn. The pig slipped, went
headfirst into the green patch, and disappeared bodily. The grass
upon the lip of the place rocked up and down in a manner that
brought a horrible suggestion of mastication to our minds.</p>

<p>"Father o' me!" gasped Red. "Watch the other!"</p>

<p>The pursuing boar had halted the moment that he saw his quarry
disappear, then, quivering with fear, and with his bristles erect,
he backed from the quaking mouth. But, alas! for the pig! His hind
feet slipped into another of the horrible openings, and with a wild
squeal of terror he disappeared.</p>

<p>Chico looked at the Golden One, and the girl put out her hand as
she spoke swiftly to Templeton.</p>

<p>"She has to leave us at once," said Red. "We must stay under
cover right here, and she will be back the moment the moon
rises."</p>

<p>The girl smiled sweetly, slipped out of the bushes, and ran
along the edge of the morass for about fifty yards. Here she turned
toward the middle of the swamp, and we watched her from our
hiding-place. Very slowly and with much care she made her way,
zigzagging cautiously across the morass. Now she would move fifteen
or twenty paces to the right, go straight ahead for another score,
and then move to the left in order to get a clear path between the
treacherous mouths that were like so many ulcers in the thin, slimy
crust of the place.</p>

<p>She was over three quarters of an hour crossing to the
copper-covered hills on the far side, and we gave a little sigh of
relief as we saw her disappear. The manner in which those two pigs
had gone from our sight had upset our nerves.</p>

<p>"Well," muttered Templeton, dragging his gaze from the hills on
the far side, "we're in the business to the end now. The real game
will start to-night. I think the girl will act honestly with
us."</p>

<p>"Of course she will," growled Chico. "I'd gamble my life on
her."</p>

<p>"And now what's the plan of campaign?" asked Red.</p>

<p>"Locate the hiding-place of the sword and get away with it as
quickly as possible," said Morgan. "We don't want to give battle to
the whole village. How many did she say are living there?"</p>

<p>"It's a big <i>kampong</i>. There must be a couple of
thousand."</p>

<p>"Then we'll show discretion," muttered Chico. "If I get my hands
upon that big prize with its handle of emerald I won't stop running
till I reach the Barito."</p>

<p>The sun dropped lower and lower, and we sat there in the tangle
of creepers and waited patiently. We felt that we were very close
to the wonder that we were in search of. I don't know why we felt
so confident, but the very eeriness of our surroundings seemed to
make us feel that our expedition would be successful. Still, when
we thrust our chances under the cold glare of common sense, we
received a chill as we pictured the teeming village upon the other
side and compared it with our own strength.</p>

<p>"Three men against a thousand or so," I ventured to remark,
after Templeton had mentioned the probable strength of the
<i>kampong</i>.</p>

<p>"Numbers don't count," said Chico Morgan. "And every adventure
that was ever planned was against common sense. Common sense is the
kind of stuff that glues you to a ten-dollar-a-week job while
others go out collecting spoil. Didn't you say that this blade
would cause a revolution, Templeton?"</p>

<p>"I did," answered Red. "It will stir the East like a flame. This
tribe of Kyans have no dealings with the sea Dyaks, or they would
have known of its value years ago."</p>

<p>The sun touched the belt of jungle, and the last rays stained
that morass the colour of blood. A thin vapour seemed to rise from
it as the heat of the day decreased, and those vapour shapes looked
anything but reassuring to us. It would not take a vivid
imagination to think of them as the ghosts of those who had been
swallowed up in that quivering slough.</p>

<p>Templeton interrupted us in our contemplation of the rising
vapours. He placed a big hand on each of our heads and pushed us
forward so that we could peep through a hole which he had cut in
the curtain of green.</p>

<p>"Look!" he whispered. "At the swamp! Look!"</p>

<p>Of all the extraordinary happenings that took place on that
journey of journeys, none impressed me more than the sight which
met our eyes at that moment. I don't know why. We witnessed
occurrences that were more thrilling, but that one particular
incident lives in my memory. It is an undigested happening which
refuses to be brought down to the level of commonplace
recollections by the acid of time.</p>

<p>Through the ghostly mists that were rising from the morass moved
a human python, hundreds of feet in length. It was a column of
natives that twisted in and out among the green mouths as it moved
slowly toward the copper-coloured slopes on the far side of the
quagmire.</p>

<p>"Over a thousand," muttered Red. "Nearer two," said Chico. "What
are they carrying?"</p>

<p>We stared at the bamboo poles which the leading four carried
upon their shoulders, then, as if the knowledge had come to us at
the same moment, we glanced into each other's faces.</p>

<p>"Suffering sinners!" gasped Templeton. "It is!"</p>

<p>Chico was bobbing his head as he counted slowly, then he
moistened his lips before pronouncing the tally.</p>

<p>"Ten," he said quietly. "Gung must have escaped from them."</p>

<p>Red Templeton and I checked the trophies that were slung by
pieces of rattan to the bamboos. There were only ten. One of the
Dyaks or the Hindu had escaped the slaughter and had managed to
save his headpiece from becoming a smoked ornament in the village
in the copper-coloured hills.</p>

<p>The line manoeuvred till our eyes grew dim in watching it. Very
slowly the thousand or more naked warriors worked their way across
the swamp, and as they got farther and farther away from our
hiding-place, the vapours from the wet ground came up between us
like a curtain, and through occasional breaks we watched with a
strange fascination the followers of the Spotted Panther go into
the fast falling night.</p>

<p>That was a review that struck terror into us. The place seemed
dead before we had sighted the human centipede moving across the
swamp, now it seemed packed with life. We pictured the teeming
village upon the other side as our fingers tightened on our
revolvers and rifles, and the gurgling noise of the devilish morass
came to our ears as if it mocked our efforts.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care to cross that place in the dark," said Chico.
"I hope when we're doing a retreat from the other side that we'll
pick a nice day for the job."</p>

<p>"Let's hope we'll have a say as regards the time," muttered
Templeton. "If I could turn round and go back I'd go, but by all
that I hold sacred, I can't go! I must go on! I brought you two
into this business, and if you want to turn
around&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" interrupted Morgan. "We knew what kind of a game we
were up against before we decided to come. And we're like you, we
couldn't turn tail if we wanted to. That big Sword of Buddha is
dancing before my eyes day and night. How is it with you,
Lenford?"</p>

<p>"I'm in the same condition," I answered. "I want to see the
sword."</p>

<p>Chico pulled a flask from his pocket and held it out to Red.
"Drink to it," he said. "We'll get it or it will get us, and we
won't grumble at fate whichever way the cards fall."</p>

<p>We drank the toast that Chico had given, and then we crouched in
the darkness and waited. Morgan had told the truth when he said
that the sword was continually before his eyes. It was before the
eyes of the three of us. The Chalice of Everlasting Fire had
appeared wonderful to us that night when we had seen it in
Banjermassin, but the Great Parang of Buddha appeared a thousand
times more wonderful as we thought of the stories which Templeton
and Gung had told us concerning it. The big blade was the
foundation of a thousand wonderful legends. With it, according to
Hindu myth, Buddha had cut the stars of the heavens into their
proper sizes before flinging them into space, and it is written in
the records of the Rock Temple of Udis that the great teacher had
used the weapons to sever the flaming wire which the legions of sin
had bound around the earth. If the exhibition of the sacred tooth
of Gautama in the Temple of Kandy produced such unrest among the
Singhalese that the English Government was forced to prohibit the
Buddhist priests from exhibiting the relic, we wondered what frenzy
of excitement would be produced when we carried the long-lost sword
from Borneo to the mainland, where millions were awaiting its
reappearance.</p>

<p>A pale glow appeared upon the horizon, and we watched the
morass. The moon was rising, and with the moon would come Nao, the
Golden One, to guide us across the quivering plain that lay between
us and the village.</p>

<p>"The capture of the Dyak carriers might make them suspicious
to-night," whispered Templeton. "She might have a job to get
away."</p>

<p>"She'll get away," muttered Chico.</p>

<p>"Let's hope so," I said. "I'm hungry for a look at the sword,
but the way that pig disappeared has scared me off any attempt to
make the trip without a guide."</p>

<p>The moon peeped above the jungle belt, and our eyes were fixed
upon the morass as the ghostly light made it perceptible. Ten
million frogs were croaking in that place. Their music went up into
the night, and we wondered how the gentle headhunter could woo
slumber with the racket at his front door.</p>

<p>"I hope they do this every evening," whispered Chico. "If it is
a special uproar on account of some frog festival, it's likely to
cause insomnia in the camp."</p>

<p>Chico Morgan possessed a fund of humour that prevented him from
taking a pessimistic view of any situation in which he might find
himself, but the landscape that confronted us that evening was of a
kind that would try the nerves of the most confirmed optimist in
the world. Running like an undernote in the terrific frog chorus
was the unholy grumbling and gurgling of the Million Mouths of
Boorsh, and one could not keep the imagination from speculating on
the slaughter that those mouths had accomplished.</p>

<p>"It's getting late," murmured Templeton. "I've been straining my
eyes, but I can't see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A slight noise in the bushes to the left made Templeton stop
abruptly, and we listened attentively. The surrounding undergrowth
offered fine possibilities for a sporting headhunter who might fire
his little poisoned darts into our hiding-place or creep up close
enough to get in a finishing stroke with a razor-edged parang.</p>

<p>The frogs took a slight intermission as frogs sometimes do when
the leader of the bass is disturbed, and in that little
intermission we heard a silvery voice whispering into the night. It
whispered one word, and it repeated that word over and over again
like a child learning a lesson.</p>

<p>"Leesbon! Leesbon! Leesbon!" Nao had caught the name of Lisbon
when Chico had said that it was the place where she belonged, and
she was using it as a countersign in making her way toward us.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="chaphead">One-Who-Never-Slept</p>

<p class="first"><br>
OF the thoughts of Morgan and Templeton as we put foot upon that
morass I cannot write. They gave no outward sign that they
experienced any thrill out of the common, and I am firmly convinced
that if the world was canvassed to find two men who would face that
place without betraying the slightest fear, no two could be found
better qualified than Red and Chico. But of my own feelings I can
speak authoritatively. As we followed Nao out upon the shaking
crust on which the peculiar ulcer-like openings appeared at close
intervals, my physical fear was such that I had, for the first time
during the trip, a mad desire to thrust my craving for the sword
from my mind and rush for the Barito.</p>

<p>I think Chico Morgan understood my feelings. He made as if he
would follow Templeton, who walked next to the Golden One, but he
changed his mind, and pushing me next to Red, he took the tail end
of the procession.</p>

<p>"It takes me back to Vermont," he said. "Can't you imagine that
you're testing the ice, and that you'll get a blamed good wetting
if you flop through?"</p>

<p>"We'll get something more than a wetting if we break through
this crust," I spluttered.</p>

<p>"But we won't break through," said Chico. "Don't you remember
how we got into this deal? We went out for a stroll because we were
mighty near crying for old Broadway, and now, Lenford, I feel we're
going to get the treasure that will take us back in style."</p>

<p>Up and down on that flaky crust went Nao, and we followed her
carefully. There were a dozen different routes across the place,
but she assured Templeton that she was taking us by the easiest
way, and the one which would best suit her plans when we reached
the other side.</p>

<p>"Will there be any one at the end of the track?" asked
Chico.</p>

<p>Red put the question and translated the girl's reply. "We will
be received by a person called 'One-Who-Never-Slept,'" he said.
"She says that she will explain everything before we get across, so
I guess it is no use rushing her with inquiries."</p>

<p>The moon was blotted out by a pack of fat clouds when we were
but halfway across the place, and as progress was impossible in a
bad light we had to stand still and wait till the heavy masses had
rolled from the face of the orb. I cursed those slow-moving clouds
during the enforced wait. The ground shivered at intervals,
reminding one of the preliminary tremors of an earthquake, and that
shivery feeling crawled into my system till my teeth chattered. To
make the wait more terrifying the frogs ceased their uproar, and we
waited in a silence that was broken only by the gurgling noise of
the mouths that were all around us.</p>

<p>"It would be unlucky if a storm came up," whispered the
irrepressible Chico. "We should have to camp here till morning, and
then the Spotted Panther's lookout would pipe us off while we were
scooting back to the other side."</p>

<p>A frog of enormous size hopped upon my shoe at that moment, and
I understood the condition of my nerves by the shock which I
experienced. The Million Mouths of Boorsh had made a heavy draught
upon my courage.</p>

<p>The moon fought herself free of the cloud-wrack after what
seemed an eternity, and Nao went forward slowly and carefully. To
us there seemed no track upon the flaky surface of the place. We
conjectured that any marks made upon the surface would be blotted
out by the moisture, and we realized that the girl was finding her
way by mental pictures of the different mouths which we
skirted.</p>

<p>The rocks of the other side loomed up in front of us at last,
and my fears of death from suffocation in thick black mud were
somewhat abated. I thought that death might await us in the
<i>kampong</i> of the Spotted Panther, but a death of any other
kind was preferable to a death in the middle of that morass.</p>

<p>A ridge of black rocks came up before us, and when we had
reached these, the Golden One called a halt. We guessed from the
manner in which the swamp stretched out on either side of the rocks
that they formed an island in the sea of horrible mud, and our
surmise proved correct.</p>

<p>We halted near a big boulder, and Nao proceeded to explain
rapidly to Templeton the difficulties that lay immediately before
us, and Red translated her words.</p>

<p>"On the other side of these rocks is a channel of mud dividing
us from the shore," whispered Templeton, "and that is where the
person that Nao calls 'One-Who-Never-Slept' is on guard."</p>

<p>"And how are we to get across the channel?" asked Chico.</p>

<p>The Golden One started to talk rapidly as if she understood
Morgan's question. She was evidently much excited, and, as she
spoke, she put her two shapely arms above her head and made a
movement that suggested an aerial swing. Morgan and I cursed our
inability to grip the meaning of her words, and we waited anxiously
for Templeton's version.</p>

<p>"Now we're getting into action," said Red. "According to her
explanation there is a swinging rope across the little channel, but
the guard on the other side controls the rope. When the right
password comes from this side he lets the rope fly over to the
signaller, and the visitor swings across. The fibre rope is tied to
the limb of a tree that grows out over the channel from the side
that the watcher is on."</p>

<p>Chico whistled softly and looked hard at Nao, who was studying
the heavens as if interested in the fat clouds that seemed to be
surrounding the white moon.</p>

<p>"And how are we to get Mr. Sleepless to pass us through?" asked
Morgan.</p>

<p>A big cloud sprang upon the moon as Chico put the question, and
the Golden One showed intense excitement as she turned toward
Templeton.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" I questioned.</p>

<p>"The right moment has arrived," said Templeton. "She'll give the
signal while the moon is under the cloud, and, when the rope comes
across, one of us must swing over the channel and stop old
Never-Blink from making a noise."</p>

<p>Nao was moving across the rock at that moment, and, as we
followed her, we began to think that "her beautiful head contained
sufficient gray matter to build a scheme or two. She had been
waiting for that cloud pack to obscure the moon, and now she
motioned us to hurry as she sped across the rocks.</p>

<p>"Who'll swing across?" I whispered.</p>

<p>"Leave it to her," answered Templeton. "Let her run this part of
the business as she thinks fit."</p>

<p>Nao halted us behind a big rock and we waited in silence. From
somewhere to the right came a nasal chant, but the clouds had so
effectually smothered the moon that we could not see the singer.
But we knew that we were close to the channel. The gurgling that we
had missed while crossing the rocks was quite close to us now, and
we understood that the person chanting the Malayan poem was the
guardian of the swinging rope. Nao touched Chico with her little
hand, motioned to him to walk immediately behind her, then moving
out upon a smooth platform of rock, she sent a hail across the
river of mud.</p>

<p>The guard replied with a question which was evidently answered
to his satisfaction, but it was clear to us that he was in the
habit of doing things in a methodical and leisurely fashion. And he
did something at that moment that startled us exceedingly. With the
evident intention of giving the Golden One sufficient light to
enable her to swing across the channel in safety, he set fire to a
huge torch of resin-wood, and we crouched as the light flashed
across the mud.</p>

<p>Chico, who was standing behind Nao, immediately dropped upon his
hands and knees, and with thumping hearts we watched the Dyak wave
the torch above his head. If he discovered Morgan he would raise an
alarm that would bring the village down upon us, and we cursed him
as he stood and peered across at the girl. At that moment we saw
the huge limb of the mohor tree that grew out over the channel, and
the long rope of plaited fibre that hung from it, one end of which
was tied loosely round a projection of rock at the side of the
watchful sentinel.</p>

<p>"Damn him!" breathed Templeton.</p>

<p>Nao gave an impatient cry, and the One-Who-Never-Slept unwound
the rope from the rocky projection. Holding the torch high above
his head, he rolled the loose end into a ball, and jerked it across
the channel.</p>

<p>The girl caught it deftly, and, raising her arms above her head,
stood for a moment as if preparing to jump. Never-Blink was
watching as if he found enjoyment in noting the light of the torch
flash upon the golden limbs of the girl, and we prayed that he
would give his attention to something else so that Chico would get
an opportunity to take the place of the maid.</p>

<p>But the sentinel showed no intention of heeding the mental
suggestion which we tried to convey, and we waited breathlessly.
Each moment we expected him to locate Chico and send a wild yell of
warning into the night. Templeton was breathing in a manner that
brought visions of an apoplectic seizure, and Nao was evidently
upset by the keen scrutiny of the eyes upon the other side.</p>

<p>It was Red who relieved the tension. He understood that Morgan
could not make an attempt while the light of the torch was upon the
place where the girl was standing, and he realized that Nao might
do something foolish if nothing were done to relieve the strain.
Besides, the moon was pushing its way through the clouds that had
covered her so opportunely. Templeton seized a piece of rock, and,
rising upon his knees, he flung the missile at the torch-holder on
the other side!</p>

<p>There was never a stone flung with such unerring aim. The rock
hit the sentinel on the jaw, and his thin legs crumpled beneath
him. Still clinging to the torch, he made an effort to rise, but
the effort only brought him into more trouble. Chico Morgan had
sprung for the rope the moment Templeton's missile had struck the
mark, and, as One-Who-Never-Slept attempted to rise, Chico's heavy
shoes smashed against his chest and sent him backward. Never-Blink
had lost his reputation at last.</p>

<p>Templeton followed Morgan when Chico flung back the rope, then
the Golden One shot like a bird across the muddy channel, and I
followed her. The moon was clear of the clouds, and we could see
plainly the platform of rock that was worn smooth by the feet of
the warriors of the Spotted Panther. Farther along the rocky bank
there were half a dozen other ropes that were evidently put in use
when the head-hunters were out in force, as we had seen them that
afternoon as they made their way across the Million Mouths of
Boorsh.</p>

<p>"We had luck," muttered Chico, as he gagged old Never-Blink.
"That was a good idea of yours to crack his jaw with a rock."</p>

<p>"If it had missed we'd have been in a fix," said Red. "He'd have
made enough row with this thing to wake the dead."</p>

<p>He pointed to a "bull-roarer," the strange wooden instrument
used by some of the Kyan tribes to produce noise, and I blessed the
accuracy of Red's aim. I shuddered as I contemplated a wild run
across the gurgling morass with a thousand fleet-footed followers
of the Panther on our trail. The thoughts of such a pursuit brought
back pictures of the ten trophies which we had seen carried upon
the bamboo poles at the head of the snaky line of warriors.</p>

<p>Chico finished his job of trussing up the half-stunned watchman,
and then we stood in a circle and looked at each other. We had
gained the shore, but we had formed no plan as to how we should
proceed. Templeton and Morgan had fixed convictions that plans were
only useful where there was no opposition, so we had wasted no
thought upon what we should do at the village till we were certain
that we would arrive there with our heads attached to our
bodies.</p>

<p>A winding path led up a slight slope immediately in front of us,
and at the top of the rise, we knew from the description furnished
us by the Golden One, was the village.</p>

<p>"Ask her if she can guide us to the spot now," whispered Chico.
"See if she knows the exact place where the sword is hidden?"</p>

<p>Templeton fired the questions at the girl swiftly, and she
answered rapidly.</p>

<p>"She knows where it is hidden," said Red, "but she is doubtful
if we can get in to-night."</p>

<p>"Why?" questioned Chico.</p>

<p>"It takes a hundred men to move the stone at the door of the
cave. There is a crevice in the rock through which the sword could
be seen by the people, but it was through the crevice that the
Chalice of Everlasting Fire was stolen, and since then the Great
Parang 'is removed out of the reach of thieves. She says if we
could remove the stone slab we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how the devil does she think we could move it?" interrupted
Chico.</p>

<p>Templeton looked at the girl, whose glorious eyes were fixed on
Morgan, then he spoke softly to Chico. "We must go quietly," he
said. "She thinks that little obstructions are nothing to you. Do
you understand? She has booked you up as a sort of demigod, and she
tells me this little tale about the stone slab as if it made no
difference to you."</p>

<p>Morgan's mouth opened, but no words escaped. He stared at Nao
for a few moments, then he looked up the little shadowy path that
zigzagged up the slope.</p>

<p>Red put a question and the girl answered, then he turned to
Chico.</p>

<p>"The cave is open on the nights of the Blood Moon," he said
quickly. "She doesn't know when that will be. It depends on the
moon and the brother of the Panther. Seven nights ago was the last
time that the stone was rolled away."</p>

<p>"Glory be!" murmured Morgan. "Will you ask her where we can stow
ourselves away to think about the situation."</p>

<p>"She knows a place," said Red. "She is willing to guarantee our
safety, and I'm willing to trust her to the last."</p>

<p>"So am I," snapped Chico. "Tell me what to do with Never-Blink
and I'll follow on."</p>

<p>We looked at the trussed Kyan on the rock, and the girl, as if
she understood the matter under discussion, spoke rapidly to
Red.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Morgan.</p>

<p>"She says," whispered Templeton, "that the White <i>Mias</i> has
been known to cross the swamp and kill a sentinel. That is the
reason why there is no bridge across this channel. She thinks if he
fell into the mud that they would put the job at the door of the
orang-utan legion."</p>

<p>The naivete of the girl would have made us smile at any other
time, but we were in no mood for laughter at that moment. There
were a thousand dangers to be faced before we could put our eyes on
the Great Sword of Buddha, and retreat was impossible now. We had
to go on to the end, and as we stood looking down at the sentinel a
cold puff of air came across the gurgling morass, and I shivered as
I thought of the mystery which surrounded us. Here in a backwater
of time was a treasure of which four hundred million people dreamed
as their ancestors had dreamed for centuries&mdash;centuries that
had piled themselves one on top of another till the story of the
Great Sword was adjudged a fable by Western investigators who had
endeavoured to trace its history. But the Orient believed. Time
matters nothing to the East, and if proof is not there&mdash;well,
why worry?</p>

<p>Chico stooped suddenly and put his hand on the breast of the
watchman.</p>

<p>"Wow!" he exclaimed. "He's dead! Either the stone on the jaw or
the collision with me, or perhaps his wounded pride, has sent him
over the dark river. Well, it saves us from a very vexatious
problem. I couldn't think of tumbling a live man into this gurgling
mass, but now it doesn't matter much. Lend a hand, Lenford, and
then we'll go ahead."</p>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The Spotted Panther</p>

<p class="first"><br>
IT is the soul of a country that goes out across the seas and
creates impressions. The dweller at the end of the world who has
read little about America, England, France, Germany, or a score of
other countries that we call clean and wholesome, senses their
wholesomeness. It comes to him on the breeze. And that night as we
crawled up the little path that led from the Mouths of Boorsh, we
understood why Borneo had created an atmosphere of fear. A country
is like a human being. We instinctively hate the low-browed ruffian
before we exchange words with him, and in the same manner we sense
a country of which we have read little. And we felt as we peered
over the rise that we were looking at the real dark soul of Borneo
which had made the land unattractive to people who had neither
visited nor read of it.</p>

<p>"Body o' me!" whispered Chico. "What a sweet, little camp!" Red
Templeton swept his eyes over the place and then glanced at the
girl. The Golden One had lived in that village all her life, and as
we looked at the <i>kampong</i>, and then at the sweet face of the
girl, we thought of a violet growing in a pit of filth and
darkness.</p>

<p>There is no other place in the world that could inspire the
terror which seemed to well out from that village. We thought that
the centuries had given it a devilish appearance, and that every
deed of blood committed there hung above the place. Chico Morgan
and Templeton were not of the imaginative kind, but in the first
few minutes after we gained the rise and crouched to examine the
village thoroughly before moving forward, I could see that both
were impressed by the Very essence of villainy which seemed to
envelop the place.</p>

<p>"It's as pretty as a sleeping cobra," muttered Templeton. "Those
holes in the rock look like tombs."</p>

<p>The village proper was built Dyak fashion. Seven long houses of
bark and timber, covered with palm leaves that were sewn together
and then tied to the rafters with palm fibre, stood in a row, but
these houses, although they looked anything but inviting, were not
responsible for the chill which the place gave to us. Immediately
at the rear of the community houses was a cliff of copper-coloured
rock that rose to a great height, and it was this hill that
attracted our attention. The face of the cliff was bored with
hundreds of round holes, and it was evident that the followers of
the Spotted Panther, either too lazy to build wooden houses, or
thinking they were more secure from the attacks of enemies if they
slept at a greater elevation, had scooped out sleeping quarters in
the soft rock, and the entrances of these chambers appeared to us
like so many blind eyes as we stared at them in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"It's a good job we stopped old Never-Blink from twirling that
bull-roarer," said Chico. "If he had sprung an alarm they would
have been on us like a thousand wolves."</p>

<p>Beyond the long family houses the jungle rose up again like a
wall, and it was in this direction that Nao pointed as she answered
the questions which Templeton put to her concerning the location of
the Cave of the Blood Moon, where the treasure was secreted.</p>

<p>"She says that the cave is at the other end of the village,"
said Templeton. "We must circle around it through the jungle, and
we've got to hurry. The moon will set in a few hours, and we must
find a hiding-place."</p>

<p>With Nao leading, we circled the sleeping village, taking
especial care to make a wide detour so that there would be no
chance of stumbling upon a Dyak warrior taking a moonlight stroll.
The stillness of the place was amazing. A silence that was
depressing hung above the long houses and the holes in the cliff,
and we were surprised at hearing no sounds.</p>

<p>But the Golden One explained that the intense quiet was no proof
that every villager was sleeping quietly.</p>

<p>"She says that they are scared out of their wits by the White
<i>Mias</i>," explained Templeton. "They get into their holes the
moment it is dark, and they won't come out till daybreak. Only the
two guards, one at each end of the village, keep watch."</p>

<p>"And why isn't Nao afraid to be out?" asked Chico.</p>

<p>Templeton put a question regarding the girl's fear of the
supposed queen of the orang-utans, but for a minute or so the
Golden One walked on without making an answer. Presently she turned
and touched Morgan upon the arm, and Red smiled as he translated
her words.</p>

<p>"You saved her from the fellow with the blowpipe, so she thinks
you can save her from anything," he said.</p>

<p>"Leesbon," whispered the girl her big eyes shining as she looked
at Chico.</p>

<p>"Lisbon it is," said Morgan. "When we get hold of this big sword
you'll get a share that will make you wealthy enough to buy the
biggest castle in the whole of Portugal."</p>

<p>Nao smiled like a child as we slipped rapidly through the
jungle. The Lord alone knows what a procession of thoughts streamed
through her brain from the moment we had met her that morning at
the moss-covered cross in the jungle. It seemed a year to us as we
circled the <i>kampong</i>, but it must have seemed a decade to the
Golden One. She had told Templeton that her father and mother were
both dead, and that the only two who conversed with her in the
Portuguese tongue were two old women who were supposed to be her
aunts. There were others in the village who understood the
language, but it was against the wish of the Spotted Panther for it
to be spoken, and when she did use it in addressing the two old
dames, Nao took care that no one would overhear the
conversation.</p>

<p>We came out upon a small clearing at the west side of the
village, which was the end farthest away from the morass, and the
girl stopped. Holding up her finger as a warning lest we might make
a noise that would alarm the sentinel at that end of the
<i>kampong</i>, she crossed the clearing, and stopped before a
stone cliff that seemed part of the same ridge into which the Orang
Bukkit had burrowed for sleeping places.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;" muttered Templeton. "What
is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He saw then, and we saw, too. The shadow of the trees had fallen
upon the stone wall, and for the moment we had not seen the slab.
We were in front of the Cave of the Blood Moon in which the Parang
of Buddha and many other things that we knew not of were
secreted!</p>

<p>I know that we forgot the stories which we had heard about the
Spotted Panther in the minutes that immediately followed. We forgot
the village with its hundreds of savage warriors. We forgot the ten
heads which we had seen carried across the swamp, we forgot
everything but the treasure which was so near to us. Gung had told
the truth. We knew he had, but the proof that was before us brought
upon us a mental excitement that amounted to a delirium. Up before
our eyes sprang a picture of the waiting Orient&mdash;the ever
patient, ever waiting Orient&mdash;and we felt inclined to shout as
we realized that we were within grasping distance of the thing
which the East had waited for centuries to behold.</p>

<p>And strange as it may appear now that I set it down here in
words, we seemed to feel that the big Sword felt our presence and
responded to it. This seems an insane statement, but it must be
written. Perhaps the concentrated thought of millions may have had
something to do with it. I cannot explain the feeling, but I do
know that Templeton, Morgan, and I felt that something that
throbbed with life itself was waiting within that place for us to
liberate it. Like the Chalice of Everlasting Fire, one could think
of that Sword as being charged with life. For centuries it had been
the hub around which the thoughts of all good Buddhists had
constantly revolved, and if the power of thought was capable of
doing anything at all, those two articles which the buccaneer,
Enrique de Gama, had attempted to carry into the Western World were
surely something more than mere metal and precious stones.</p>

<p>Chico Morgan was insane at that moment. He clutched the great
slab of stone&mdash;the slab that the Golden One had informed us
was so heavy that it took one hundred men to move it from the mouth
of the cave&mdash;and he pulled at it with straining muscles.</p>

<p>"Lend a hand!" he growled.</p>

<p>"It's useless," protested Red. "We couldn't move it."</p>

<p>"Try," gasped Chico. "I think I moved it a trifle!"</p>

<p>Templeton and I put our shoulders against the stone, but we had
as much chance of moving it as an ox team would have of pulling the
Khas Mahal at Agra. The great slab of stone was fitted into a
trench cut in the rock, and it was only by means of ropes and an
immense amount of energy that it could be moved.</p>

<p>Nao had watched Chico without the slightest protest against his
mad attack upon the slab. Her faith in Morgan was immense. As the
big American tugged fiercely at the stone she had gazed at it in a
manner that told Templeton and me that she would not have been
surprised if Chico had moved it, although she had asserted that it
took one hundred warriors to move the block when the cave was
entered at irregular intervals.</p>

<p>Morgan stopped struggling, kicked the slab with his shoe and
turned to Templeton.</p>

<p>"Ask her where the crevice is!" he cried. "Quick! The moon is
going!"</p>

<p>Red put the question, and Nao led us quickly to the crack in the
wall of the cave through which Gung and Courtney had stolen the
Chalice of Everlasting Fire. The fissure was caused by a disruption
of the strata, and although it was five or six feet in length, it
was not more than eight inches in width at its widest point. Why
the wonderful cup had been exposed near the opening was something
that we had not been able to fathom, but as Chico thrust his hand
into the crevice, Nao immediately connected the movement with the
loss of the Vessel of Flame.</p>

<p>"She says there is no hope of reaching anything that way," said
Red. "Courtney and Gung must have had a streak of luck from what
she relates. The Cup was left out after the door was shut, and it
was thrust in through the crevice for the time being."</p>

<p>Chico gave up his search in disgust, and, much chagrined, the
three of us stood back and looked at the treasure vault.</p>

<p>"If I had a plug of dynamite I'd blow the front out of it,"
growled Morgan, "and I'd take a chance of getting away from the
bunch that are around the quarters.'"</p>

<p>"Dynamite would be no good," said Templeton. "We must use tact.
We must watch and wait. We can do nothing to-night, so we had
better let Nao show us to the hiding-place she knows of."</p>

<p>"I hate to leave this spot for a minute," said Chico. "I hope
the hiding-place is handy!"</p>

<p>The Golden One turned as Templeton explained that we could do
nothing more that evening, but she had not taken a dozen steps when
she stopped and leaned forward. Her ears, keener than ours, had
caught the sound of footsteps, and we wriggled into the velvety
shadow of the rocky wall as the sounds became more distinct. The
night prowler was coming toward the big stone slab, and the girl
stepped quickly into the shadows beside us. We surmised that it was
one of the sentinels making a round of the village, and we waited
patiently.</p>

<p>The soft footfalls came from the edge of the clearing, and we
stopped breathing. Thoughts of the racket which the bull-roarer
could fling into the silent night welled up in our minds, and we
prayed that the invisible watcher would come close enough to give
us a chance to spring upon him before he had an opportunity at
whirling the devilish wooden noise-maker around his head.</p>

<p>But it was not the watchman who was approaching. Out of the
shadows at the edge of the open space stepped a man who was more
muscular than any man we had ever seen, and we knew immediately who
he was. We had formed a mental picture of one man, and that one had
appeared suddenly before us. The bark-cloth mask that covered the
face that could not be looked upon by his followers told us that
the prowler on the clearing was no other than the Spotted
Panther!</p>

<p>Afterward when we compared notes we wondered if the faint light
of the setting moon had made him appear larger than he really was,
but we finally came to the conclusion that he was the biggest man
we had ever seen. And he was. Standing there on the clearing he
seemed a giant, and the mask that fell down over his bare shoulders
and breast made his figure more awe-inspiring. Fully six feet four
in height, he had a chest that made us gasp as we looked at him,
while the huge muscles of the legs and arms suggested a strength
that made all our notions of thews and sinews topple to the ground.
Red Templeton and Morgan were men much stronger than the ordinary,
but Red and Chico were small in comparison with that savage. He was
a primitive brute, and we had no need to wonder why the Trings and
the Modangs mentioned his name with bated breath.</p>

<p>For fully three minutes he stood looking at the stone slab, then
he turned and walked toward the <i>kampong</i>, leaving us amazed
at his tremendous size.</p>

<p>"Shades of Goliath!" whispered Templeton. "He's the biggest
brute I ever saw!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry we didn't spring on him while we had the chance,"
said Chico. "He gave me a chill, and I've got a notion that he'll
make our little job a hard one."</p>

<p>Nao led us through a clump of nipa-palm, turned and scaled a
rather steep path at the rear of the cave, and then, crawling
cautiously along a narrow ledge of rock, she stopped in front of
one of the blind eyes in the face of the cliff and whispered to
Templeton.</p>

<p>"This is our burrow," said Red. "By the whiskers of Mahomet!
this little girl is good to us! She says that no one will come near
this hole because it is supposed to be inhabited by an
<i>aintu</i>, or spirit, and that in preparation of our coming, she
put water and rice inside the place this afternoon."</p>

<p>Chico Morgan took the girl's little hand and carried it to his
lips, then she turned quietly and ran along the ledge. As we
crawled into the hole in the face of the cliff one word floated
back to us through the soft night. The word was "Leesbon."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The Poisoned Dart</p>

<p class="first"><br>
IF Nao had not informed us that our cave was shunned because it was
supposed to be the abode of an evil spirit we might have
wrongly-attributed its desertion to the odour that came to our
nostrils the moment we were inside the round opening.</p>

<p>"Easy," whispered Chico; "we might upset the water or step on
the dish of 'paddy.' I'm certain that she must have pushed them
through the opening without venturing inside. If she had sniffed
this stench she would have hunted up better quarters for us."</p>

<p>"My!" growled Templeton. "I'm thinking the spirit must have
committed suicide. Have you found the rice?"</p>

<p>"I've got the water," said Chico. "It is in these notches of
bamboo near the opening."</p>

<p>I found the "paddy" wrapped in palm leaves beside the bamboo
water vessels, and after we had unloaded the small packs of needful
things which we had carried from the Place of Evil Winds, we
started to explore the cave in an endeavour to discover the cause
of the vile odour which nearly choked us.</p>

<p>On hand, and knees we crept over the place without making a
discovery. The floor was smooth and unbroken except for a small
hole in one corner where the moisture percolating through the roof
had eaten into the soft limestone of the floor.</p>

<p>"Feel the sides and roof," ordered Templeton. "P'raps the
<i>aintu</i> has hanged himself from the ceiling."</p>

<p>It was impossible to stand upright, as the arched roof was not
more than five feet from the floor at its highest elevation, so we
stumbled around with our backs bent in an effort to locate the
stench.</p>

<p>"I have it," whispered Morgan.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Red.</p>

<p>"Heads."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"A parcel of heads. They're tied up neatly with rattan and
strung along from two projections of rock."</p>

<p>We felt our way back to the spot where Chico was standing, and
very cautiously we touched the string of trophies. There were nine,
all dry and withered to the touch, and it was evident that some
brave warrior, after a successful headhunting raid upon the Trings
and Modangs, had endeavoured to appease the evil spirit of the cave
by presenting it with a number of trophies.</p>

<p>Chico untied the ghastly mementoes and carried them to the
opening with the intention of firing them out into the night, but
Templeton stopped him.</p>

<p>"Don't throw them out," he said.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Morgan.</p>

<p>"Because they will be picked up, and that might lead to a
search. We're taking a big risk in camping in this place, and we
don't want to increase the danger."</p>

<p>"But where are we to put them?" queried Chico.</p>

<p>"Keep them here," snapped Red. "We're too close to the prize to
take a risk."</p>

<p>Morgan put the string of skulls in the farthest corner, and we
squatted on the floor near the round opening and wondered how the
Dyaks could endure the odour of the trophies that they suspended
over their fireplaces.</p>

<p>"Two of us had better sleep while one stays on guard," said
Templeton. "You two take a nap while I watch."</p>

<p>"I can't sleep while that smell is around," grumbled Chico.
"Say, I wonder could I drop them down that hole in the corner?"</p>

<p>"Where does it lead?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It's just a hole worn by the water in the rock.
If we could push them down there I could stick some palm leaves on
top of them."</p>

<p>"Try," said Red.</p>

<p>Chico pushed the trophies into the hole one after the other, and
when they went rolling away we felt inclined to dance with joy.
Morgan stuffed the hole with some of the palm leaves that had been
wrapped round the rice, and then we stretched ourselves on the
floor while Red kept guard at the opening.</p>

<p>I was awakened out of a dream in which I thought I was watching
Buddha swinging that big parang around his head so quickly that
only a circle of flame could be seen, and I crawled hurriedly to
the opening to see what was creating the uproar that shattered the
silence of the dawn. It was an infamous noise. Chico and Red were
on their knees near the circular opening listening to the racket,
and I put a question with my mouth close to Templeton's ear.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>Red shouted his answer. "The bull-roarer," he cried. "They've
discovered that old Never-Blink is off his post, and they're
sounding an alarm."</p>

<p>It is possible that there are some instruments that will produce
a greater volume of sound than the one which was used that morning
in the village of the Spotted Panther, but I'll stake my life that
no other instrument could produce such a devilish clatter. That
noise could not be produced by civilized man. It was the poison of
barbarism turned into sound. The war drums of the Aztecs, the skin
pipes of the Papuans, and every other species of noise-making
instrument was completely outclassed by the machine used in the
Orang Bukkit village near the Mouths of Boorsh.</p>

<p>"Shades of Washington!" cried Morgan. "If he had sprung that
thing last night I wouldn't have been able to run. That takes the
strength out of my limbs."</p>

<p>That was how Templeton and I felt about that devilish sound. It
seemed to sap the strength from our legs and arms, and I suppose it
was the aim of the inventor to produce a noise that would have that
power. That infernal racket seemed to bore into our brain and stir
all the terror that was associated with noise. We seemed to know
that our ancestors in the time when the mammoth was at large were
defeated by a tribe whose drums produced the same kind of weird
music. That is how we felt. While the sound of that thing buzzing
in the air like the wings of ten million death beetles, I seemed to
know of every fight that my forefathers had participated in, at
least I knew of the losing fights. That noise was associated with
defeat&mdash;defeat for those who listened to it.</p>

<p>The three of us looked at each other as the noise continued.
There was an undercurrent of sound that we knew was caused by the
village rousing itself to find out the cause of the alarm, but the
dull, deafening boom seemed to smother the minor racket. It swelled
into a terrific thunder, the air throbbing with the clangour, then
it stopped suddenly, and a silence that had all the horror of the
noise swept over the long houses and the caves.</p>

<p>"Gee!" breathed Morgan. "I never heard a noise like that in all
my life, and I never knew a silence like this, either."</p>

<p>The sun hadn't risen when the bull-roarer stopped, and the
silence that always comes with a tropical dawn was made more
noticeable when the racket ceased so suddenly. We couldn't see any
of the natives because we were careful not to thrust our heads out
of the hole, but we had a curious feeling that the whole camp had
jumped into the morass. For promoting a creepy feeling it would be
hard to discover a more effective method than the alternate
intervals of appalling noise and silence.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" muttered Templeton. "They've either bolted
from the place or else they've gone to sleep again."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't go to sleep again if they've discovered that the
sentinel has left his beat," said Chico. "I think they have rushed
down to the channel to investigate the disappearance. I wonder if
Nao is with them?"</p>

<p>The unbroken silence made us feel certain that the whole village
had gone down to the side of the morass, and as we felt safe from
observation for the moment, Templeton thrust his head warily out of
the hole and took a peep at the landscape.</p>

<p>"I can't see a soul," he whispered. "The houses are deserted,
and there&mdash;Great Scott! here comes the Golden One!"</p>

<p>Red drew back his head, grabbed his rifle and peered out
again.</p>

<p>"She's hurrying around by the cave," he muttered hoarsely. "I
can't see her now! Yes, I can! She's coming here, and she's running
like the mischief!"</p>

<p>I wished that I was far away from the <i>kampong</i> of the
Spotted Panther at that moment. The infamous noise made by the
bull-roarer, the silence which immediately followed it, and the
information that Nao was running toward our hiding-place brought a
feeling of dread to me that I have never experienced at any other
moment. That was an eerie dawn. I tried to stiffen my spine by
picturing the Great Sword, but my teeth chattered in spite of all
my efforts. For a few seconds I entertained a profound hate for the
millions whose love for the wonderful weapon had made us so rash in
our efforts to possess it.</p>

<p>"Let me look out!" cried Chico. "The beggars must have got news
of us, and she's coming to warn us."</p>

<p>I don't know how we accomplished it, but the three of us managed
to thrust our heads into the entrance hole when the Golden One ran
along the narrow ledge and gasped a few words to Red as she dashed
past like a beautiful nymph of the dawn. She was wise enough not to
stop for an instant lest some one might have been watching, and
before Templeton had delivered the message to us she was down the
other side of the cliff and out of sight.</p>

<p>"What is wrong?" I cried. "What did she say?"</p>

<p>"They're after us," said Templeton. "She says they're on the
right scent. They've got a hound&mdash;a human hound, she
says."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Morgan.</p>

<p>"I don't know what the devil she means! She said a
man-hound."</p>

<p>"That's nice," remarked Chico. "We had better prepare for a
fight. If they've got a human bloodhound on the premises he's
liable to locate us."</p>

<p>Morgan never understood the meaning of the word fear. He took a
handful of rice and munched it contentedly while we waited for
something to happen, and the grinding of his teeth got on the big
Britisher's nerves.</p>

<p>"Stop chewing!" growled Templeton. "You're the only one in a
fifty miles radius that's making a noise."</p>

<p>"This rice is good," said Chico. "Like Geewhillikins! here they
come!"</p>

<p>Years before that morning I had read a story that described the
feelings of a runaway slave who crouched in the bushes and watched
the bloodhounds sweep down upon him, and that story came into my
mind as Chico Morgan motioned toward the point in the jungle where
we had entered the clearing on the previous evening. There was a
bloodhound upon our track at that moment, but as the Golden One had
informed us in her hasty message, it was a human bloodhound. It
made our blood curdle as we watched the head of the procession. We
were being run down by a man, who ran on all fours, and whose face
was thrust close to the ground as he followed our track
unerringly!</p>

<p>That was a fear-inspiring spectacle. For months afterward I
dreamed of that affair. I would awaken in the night, my body
covered with the cold perspiration of terror, my brain obsessed
with the belief that I was again a fugitive from the dwarfed and
doglike creature that crawled on to the clearing at the head of the
Spotted Panther's warriors.</p>

<p>"Good God!" muttered Templeton. "He's following every step we
took."</p>

<p>Perhaps there was nothing so remarkable in the work which that
twisted savage performed. The Australian aboriginal can run for
miles upon a trail, and for his ability as a tracker is hired by
the government to assist the police in lawless districts, but the
aboriginal does not exhibit the doglike characteristics we saw
displayed by the half-crippled Kyan. He really did appear to be
following our tracks by the aid of his nose and not by his eyes. It
was that peculiarity that sickened us. It made us feel qualmish as
we peered down upon the packed mass that followed the man-dog.</p>

<p>The ugly cripple, evidently tired from his efforts in following
the route by which we had circled the camp, stopped in the middle
of the clearing to rest himself, and we had a good opportunity of
viewing him as well as the crowd that surged behind. The tracker
was horribly deformed, his face was flat and beast-like, while his
twisted arms and legs were fearfully emaciated. While resting he
sat upon his haunches like a wallaby, and he whined in a manner
that made Chico curse him softly.</p>

<p>Close beside the deformed one was the Spotted Panther, his face
and neck still hidden by the bark-cloth mask, and next to the
Panther, and apparently second in command, was another tremendous
savage. Though not as tall as the chief, he was broader and more
muscular, and as they stood together we thought that we had never
seen two brown men who were their equal in stature. Behind these
two were packed hundreds of naked warriors, all armed with parangs,
spears, or sumpitans, the latter being the deadly blowpipe which
the Kyan uses with such skill.</p>

<p>The sight fascinated us. The whining savage on his haunches was
a deformed Nemesis on our trail, and as we watched him, our
imagination scooped the climax of the situation out of the future
and held it up before our eyes. The brute would lead the throng up
the path by which we had reached the cave, and if we did manage to
kill a few score of the party, our fate was plain.</p>

<p>Chico Morgan pushed forward the barrel of the rifle and looked
hungrily at the whining cripple. But there was no salvation in
shooting the brute where he sat. Instead of delaying the onslaught
it would bring the mob upon us with a rush.</p>

<p>The dog-man glanced up at the Panther, and the latter gave a
signal to continue the chase, and at that moment I made a little
discovery. It was a curious discovery to make at that moment. As
the mob swayed forward, the big hand of the Englishman was thrust
into the bosom of his khaki shirt, and as it was withdrawn I caught
a glimpse of the face of the girl upon the little locket that he
held for a second to the light. It was the face of Evelyn Courtney,
the beautiful sister of the opium smoker whose rescue from the
opium den had been the means of bringing Templeton and Morgan
together.</p>

<p>The cripple, moving very slowly and still whining dreadfully,
crept across the clearing on the path we had taken in approaching
the great slab of stone. Here he stopped and sniffed for quite a
time, looking up at the Panther at occasional intervals as if he
wished to show that person that we had consumed some time upon the
spot he then occupied.</p>

<p>"It looks as if he had been watching us," whispered Chico. "If
the brute was prowling round last night it will be all up with the
Golden One after they finish with us. Don't let that thing escape
when they rush on us. Do you hear? If we finish him we might save
Nao from the vengeance of the devils!"</p>

<p>Templeton and I nodded to signify that we had the same anxiety
to cut short the career of the cripple the moment we felt certain
that he had located our hiding-place, and then we held our breath
and watched the performance. We had no doubt about the deformed
one's knowledge. Whether he had watched us from the trees, or
whether he was possessed of some doglike instinct that enabled him
to trace us, we couldn't tell, but his trailing was accurate.</p>

<p>"We're up against it," muttered Red. "Pick off the leaders when
they're coming up the hill. If we scare them off, we might have a
chance."</p>

<p>The whining cripple was dragging himself along the path by which
Nao had led us when Morgan asked to see the crevice that had given
Gung an opportunity to secure the Chalice of Everlasting Fire, and
we gave up the hope we cherished that he would lose our trail. In
another minute he would be hidden from view by the clump of
screw-palm, and we knew that we would not see him again till he led
the naked mob up the slope immediately in front of our cave. The
fact that the wicked spirits had laid a claim upon our hiding-place
would not save us when the deformed savage pointed it out as the
spot where the assailants of old Never-Blink were hidden.</p>

<p>"It's all up," growled Chico.</p>

<p>"I guess it is," assented Templeton. "If the brute Hello! what's
happened?"</p>

<p>Morgan thrust his head out of the hole as the cripple reeled and
fell, but Templeton grabbed Chico by the shoulders and pulled him
back.</p>

<p>"Don't show yourself!" cried Red. "We've got a chance!"</p>

<p>"What hit him?" gasped Chico.</p>

<p>"A poisoned dart," answered Templeton. "Some one hiding in the
bushes has picked him off with a sumpitan. Don't put your head out,
you fool! Keep quiet! There's a hope that the bloodhound has been
put out of business."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="chaphead">We See The Moon Of Blood</p>

<p class="first"><br>
IN the minutes that passed after the deformed savage had received
the poisoned dart we sat wedged together near the mouth of the
cave. We couldn't speak. A knowledge that came to the three of us
at the same moment made our throats dry and our tongues refused to
form the words we wished to utter. From out of the creeper growth
that hemmed in the clearing a dart of death had gone swiftly and
silently to the creature that was bringing a thousand armed men to
our hiding-place, and we had no desire to question each other
concerning the identity of the person who had used the deadly
sumpitan. The words <i>"Nos somos amigos"</i>, which Nao had
uttered at the little moss-grown cross in the jungle, had not been
lightly said. We understood at that moment that the Golden One,
half delirious with the dreams which our coming had brought into
her mind, had no hesitation in proving her friendship when the
moment had arrived.</p>

<p>The happening threw the mob into a momentary panic. Their nerves
were keyed up by the possibility of coming face to face with the
persons who had caused the disappearance of the sentinel, and the
manner in which the guide had been stricken nearly produced a
stampede.</p>

<p>The Spotted Panther screamed out orders when he understood what
had happened to his tracker, and the warriors sprang for the
surrounding trees. The mysterious shot suggested a Tring ambuscade,
and with loud yells the mob rushed the encircling undergrowth.</p>

<p>The movement brought Chico to his feet. With a muttered curse he
grabbed his rifle and made an effort to get out of the cave, but
Templeton's big hands seized him before he had his shoulders
through the opening.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," cried the Englishman. "Sit quiet, you
madman!"</p>

<p>"But they'll get her!" gasped Chico. "She must be in the
bushes!"</p>

<p>"Do you think she'll wait for them?" growled Red. "She got away
while the fools were wondering where the dart came from! Do you
want to spoil her work?"</p>

<p>Chico grumbled as he flung himself flat upon the floor and drew
a bead on the Spotted Panther, who was shouting in the middle of
the clearing. Templeton's logic appealed to Morgan, but he was
determined to have a speedy revenge if the retreat of the user of
the deadly blowpipe had been cut off.</p>

<p>The crippled tracker was lying upon his face while another
savage was busily engaged plastering the wound with blue mud. But
it appeared as if the crude skill of the medicine man was of little
avail. The whining of the wounded man grew weaker and weaker, and
when it ceased altogether the blue-mud practitioner turned his
patient upon his back and made a grimace that spoke volumes.</p>

<p>"He's done his last bit of tracking," whispered Templeton.</p>

<p>"And the brown devils haven't located any one," grinned Chico.
"Gee! what a row!"</p>

<p>The warriors were trooping back on to the clearing, their
gestures plainly indicating that they had discovered nothing that
would explain the matter, and the noise increased as the surprise
caused by the mysterious shot passed away. A thousand tongues gave
vent to a thousand different opinions, while the Panther and his
big lieutenant cried orders. Single messengers were sent running in
different directions, then, as if a signal had been received by
some invisible means, the Panther turned into the jungle, and his
thousand followers, hushed into silence, followed upon his
heels.</p>

<p>With noiseless feet they filed away toward the west, and we
watched them in surprise. In five minutes the clearing was
deserted, even the mud doctor bolting hurriedly from the body of
the cripple that lay in the middle of the grassy place.</p>

<p>"What happened to them?" asked Red.</p>

<p>"Search me," said Chico. "They've taken a notion to go somewhere
in a hurry."</p>

<p>The sun crept over the belt of sandalwood, teak, and kaladang
trees, and in the intense quiet of the tropic morning we watched
and waited for the return of the brigade. Our own position was not
a comfortable one during that long wait. The heat in the little
cave was intense, and our nearness to the treasure maddened us as
we thought over a thousand insane ways of moving the great slab of
stone from the entrance. Once or twice during the long hours of the
morning Templeton had a task to restrain Chico from slipping down
the bank and attacking the slab with the limb of a tree as the
lever.</p>

<p>"We might lever it back so that one of us could crawl behind
it," grumbled Chico. "It's enough to drive a man crazy to sit here
and look at it."</p>

<p>"That's all we can do for the present," counselled</p>

<p>Red. "We've had a lump of luck to start the day with, and we
don't want to run a risk for nothing."</p>

<p>"But I seem to see the thing through the rock," muttered Chico.
"I feel it, too! Don't you fellows feel it?"</p>

<p>We nodded our heads as we stared down at the big slab that
barred our way to power and fortune. We felt the nearness of that
Sword in a way that I cannot explain. We might not have had that
peculiar feeling in any other atmosphere, and it is hard to
describe it to a person who does not know the Orient. But we felt
that the Great Parang of Buddha knew that we were near. The heat
and the silence might have affected us that morning so that we were
peculiarly susceptible to outside influence, while the incident of
the dog-man left our nerves as taut as an E string. And the strange
scents in the air made us feel as if we were as old as the
shrivelled claw in the Durga Kund. As we lay in that little cave
and soaked in the odours that came to us from the jungle and the
mudbanks, we shouldn't have shown any surprise if we had seen a
full-grown mastodon or iron-scaled glyptodon go strolling across
the landscape. We felt that we belonged to the age of the mammoth
and the hairy auroch, and the Winchester that Morgan held in his
hand seemed altogether out of place. I'll wager that we could have
handled a spear or a razor-edged parang as well as any Malay that
morning.</p>

<p>"The smell of that infernal morass makes me feel like a wild
man," muttered Templeton. "If I were in this country for three
months I'd be wearing a loin cloth and eating yams and paddy like a
full-blooded Kyan."</p>

<p>"Same here," said Chico. "If we wait in this cave for three days
there'll only be a scrap of tissue paper between me and a
headhunter."</p>

<p>Noon brought a little break in the monotony. Two very old
savages came from the community houses and dragged the body of the
dead tracker in the direction of the Mouths of Boorsh, and ten
minutes after they had disappeared Nao walked slowly across the
clearing, turned when she reached the jungle, and then walked back
again toward the village. Not once during the promenade did she
look in the direction of our hiding-place, but we understood the
motive that prompted her to take the stroll. Her intuition told her
that we would be alarmed over her safety, yet she could not muster
up enough courage to walk through the clearing while the body of
the deformed savage was lying there.</p>

<p>We watched her without speaking as she walked slowly by, and if
we had thought her a wonder woman on the day she approached the
cross, we were a thousand times more convinced of her beauty at
that moment. Helen might have looked like that when she walked upon
the ramparts of Troy and watched the armed warriors on the plain,
and the wood nymphs that played upon the slopes of Hymettus never
stepped more daintily than the Golden One as she moved beneath our
hiding-place.</p>

<p>"Gee! she's something good to look at," muttered Chico, after
she disappeared. "Her little feet didn't seem to touch the
grass."</p>

<p>Templeton smiled. "It must have been our big feet that left the
tracks for the whining brute," he said. "We should practise that
floating movement before we try to get back over the morass."</p>

<p>Morgan didn't answer, and once again the silence that seemed to
be intensified by the heat and the odours of black mud and decaying
leaves closed in upon the place. We lay for hours without speaking,
our eyes fixed upon the big stone slab that held us fascinated. And
we dreamed a thousand dreams during that hot afternoon. Once
Temple-ton forgot himself in thinking of that sword, and chanted
aloud a verse which Gung, the Hindu, had asserted was inlaid in
gold upon the blade of the weapon. Gung's translation ran:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"I, who have parted the planets,<br>
I, who have laid down the Law,<br>
Bounded the seas and the oceans,<br>
Counted the sands on each shore,<br>
Hurled up the mountains that whisper<br>
A litany sweet to the sun,<br>
Here tell to my faithful the watchword<br>
By which all my wonders are done.<br>
Ocean, and sea, and swift river,<br>
Mountain, volcano, and hill,<br>
Slow-circling planets and star dust&mdash;<br>
With <b>Faith</b> I can build them at will."</p>
<br>

<p>And we were not surprised at hearing Templeton chanting that
verse. Even when he raised his voice a little louder than what we
thought was safe under the circumstances, we did not protest. We
wanted him to chant it in a loud tone. Chico and I wanted him to.
We were so affected by the jungle, and the odours, and our nearness
to the Great Parang that we thought that the big Sword might
understand that we had come to take it out of that place. Now that
I have written this down it seems as if I have given the reader
grounds to doubt our sanity at that particular time, but we were
not insane. Our minds were flooded with a million thoughts that
came from out the backs of our brains, and we thrilled with the
knowledge that Gung's stories had unloosed within our own minds. It
was extraordinary.</p>

<p>Chico Morgan looked at Templeton searchingly, then he looked at
me. "It is five feet three inches in length," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"And inlaid with gold on both sides of the blade," I said.</p>

<p>"And the hilt is a twisted cobra in gold holding the big emerald
handle in its mouth," murmured Templeton. Then, after a slight
pause, he added: "And it would take a strong man to swing it with
his two hands."</p>

<p>Chico peered out upon the clearing, where the shadows of the
sandalwood and teak trees stole across the grass toward the big
stone slab as if curious to know what was concealed within the
cave, then he turned suddenly upon Templeton and me.</p>

<p>"Who told us about the size and look of the Sword?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Did Gung tell us?" queried Templeton, looking at me.</p>

<p>"No," I answered. "He told us of its history and the verse you
chanted, but he didn't know the size of it. He only knew that the
handle was a big emerald."</p>

<p>"We must have dreamed about the other things," said Red,
speaking slowly, "although I'm sure that the hilt is a knotted
cobra in gold that is twined, like the figure eight."</p>

<p>"And I'm certain about its length," muttered Chico. "I'll swear
it is five feet three inches in length."</p>

<p>No one spoke after that. We just lay there watching the shadows
close in and wondering about the thoughts that filled our
brains.</p>

<p>The sun slipped hurriedly down through a sky that looked as if
it were a testing cloth for Hamud Way, the Magic Dyer of
Samarkhand, and then the swift tropical night wiped the colours out
with a brush of darkness.</p>

<p>"I guess they'll come back by the morass," whispered Templeton.
"They came that way last evening."</p>

<p>"They might have come back hours ago!" said Chico. "For all we
know the devils might have hidden themselves in the jungle at the
other side of the clearing. I believe they are there. Perhaps that
is why Nao would not look in our direction as she walked by."</p>

<p>We strained our ears to catch the noises of the night as we
waited. We felt certain that Nao would bring a message to us under
cover of the darkness, and we listened for the slightest sound.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was our eagerness to hear the sound of Nao's little
feet upon the slope that made us blind to other things. It was the
bull-roarer that awakened us. That infernal noise-making instrument
again shattered the silence and we listened with the peculiar
feeling of dread which had come to us that morning.</p>

<p>"What is up now?" questioned Red.</p>

<p>"P'raps they're bringing out another blood-hound," answered
Chico. "If they do: Look! <i>Look!</i>"</p>

<p>It was strange that we didn't notice anything till Morgan gave
the cry of wonder. It is more than strange. We were so busy
listening that we had no use for our eyes, and the wonder of
wonders was happening for us at that moment. As Chico uttered the
cry we jerked our heads forward and looked. Looked is an empty word
to express what we did! We thrust our heads out toward the south
and stared and stared and stared! We made gurgling sounds. We
became drunk with a wild joy that surged up within us. Rising over
the trees, the rim showing above the league-wide stretch of jungle
like the red eye of a dream ogre, was the moon. <i>A red moon!</i>
The vapours rising from the jungle seemed to wrap it till its face
appeared to be covered with a piece of purple chiffon, and as the
bull-roarer set the air vibrating we gave a joint cry of joy.</p>

<p>"The Moon of Blood!" we repeated over and over again. "The Moon
of Blood! The Moon of Blood!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The Great Parang</p>

<p class="first"><br>
WE could well imagine how that constantly recurring phenomenon
startled the savages. That the moon which ordinarily rose with a
face as white as the chalk cliffs of Said should change that face
to one of crimson suggested to the minds of the Panther's followers
that something was amiss. They did not realize how the enveloping
haze which rose from the Mouths of Boorsh veiled the moon while it
hung low upon the horizon. The red orb suggested anger, and they
had looked around for some means of appeasing that anger. The
genius of the place had evidently suggested that the Great Parang
of Buddha be shown to the angry goddess of the night, and a tribal
ceremony was immediately introduced. The moon had become white as
it rose above the haze, and the genius who suggested the bringing
forth of the big blade received the plaudits of the mob. In all
probability he was appointed bearer of the sword, with special
perquisites in the way of boar fat and tender yams.</p>

<p>The bull-roarer flung out waves of sound that one pictured as
projectiles of concentrated noise flying out over the
grenadier-like trees. The cliff seemed to tremble with the infernal
uproar. It rolled over us in a deafening volume, and to add to the
clamour, the savages made a booming noise with their mouths as they
rushed toward the treasure cave.</p>

<p>Chico tightened his belt and gripped his rifle. The moment that
we had dreamed of was at hand. Our hearts pounded madly with
excitement, and I know that the blood surged through my head in a
way that made me think that I should be the victim of an apoplectic
seizure if the bull-roarer did not cease.</p>

<p>"What will be our plans?" cried Morgan. "Is there anything
special to do?"</p>

<p>"We must trust to our luck," answered Templeton. "We don't know
what opportunity will turn up. Do nothing foolish, and stick
together."</p>

<p>The clearing was black with screaming, fighting men at that
moment. The place was still in the shadow of the trees, and we
blessed the fact as we crawled through the mouth of the cave and
wriggled like rock snakes along the ledge. No adventure that was
ever written of was like that adventure. We were certain of that as
we wormed our way forward. And we were as old as the jungle! All
the tricks of the cave men came to us as we went slowly down the
slope, and I know that my own fingers longed for the feel of a
flint axe that could drive its way "through brawn and brain," and
for which I would have gladly exchanged the revolver I clutched
tightly.</p>

<p>A man can shed the husk of civilization in a moment. Templeton,
Morgan, and I flung off the veneer that evening. It was a miracle.
I know that we were one with our ancestors of the Paleozoic Age,
and our fighting rules were the same as those whose bones turn up
in the Cambrian Beds. We, too, could have fought over the gristle
of the mammoth or howled a challenge into the night wind. The
change terrified us in a way, and yet it thrilled us. We were as
primitive as the naked savages whose wild cries came up to us on
the strange little puffs of air that came from the jungle.</p>

<p>Chico led the way, Templeton followed, and I brought up the
rear. And Chico moved swiftly. Down below us came the grunting of
fivescore men struggling with the tremendous slab of stone. There
was the noise of crunching rock, and above all the hoarse shouts of
the Spotted Panther.</p>

<p>Chico stopped for a moment, but Red urged him forward. The
Englishman was a madman just then.</p>

<p>"Go on!" he whispered. "Don't stop! Keep moving!"</p>

<p>We crept past the creeper masses and the clumps of screw-palm,
and the desire to possess the Sword became an agony to us. Our
souls cried out for it, and our hands clutched convulsively at the
darkness where our crazy imaginations flung up pictures of the
thing.</p>

<p>A yell went up from the mob at the door of the cavern, and we
knew that the big slab had been pulled aside. We pictured that
crowd swarming into the cave to lay their hands upon the Great
Sword of Buddha.</p>

<p>"Go on!" snarled Templeton. "Don't stop!"</p>

<p>We had passed the crevice in the cave wall then, and the dark
flank of the struggling natives was only a few yards away.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment!" whispered Chico. "You'll be torn to pieces if
you rush them!"</p>

<p>We halted, panting and perspiring, and the mob in front
struggled like beasts. At last, over the yells and screams, came
the roar of the Panther, and looking with eyes that had cat's
vision through the very intensity of our longing to see, we had our
first glimpse of the Sword.</p>

<p>The Panther carried it. High up over the black mass of bodies
its big blade licked at a moonbeam that came through the trees to
meet it, and we wept with joy and longing and hope fulfilled.
Templeton went insane for the moment. He started to chant the verse
that Gung said was engraved upon the blade.</p>

<p>"That's it!" he gurgled. "That's it!" Then he chanted:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"I, who have parted the planets,<br>
I, who have laid down the Law,<br>
Bounded the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<br>

<p>"Shut up!" growled Chico. "Shut up, you fool!" The blade glinted
in the moonbeams as the Panther moved out into the clearing, and we
seemed to be sucked forward by the surge of the mob, who were blind
to our presence. They had eyes only for the Great Sword, and we
might have crawled under their feet without being noticed at that
moment. As the Panther lifted it high above his head, each man in
the mob flung his right arm into the air, and made a noise with his
mouth similar to the marching tune of the Aisawan dancers, and we
found it difficult to keep on our stomaches when that sound came to
our ears. We wanted to get up and follow the Panther&mdash;follow
him round the clearing with our right arms raised and our eyes on
the sword!</p>

<p>There was magic in the night. It sent us reeling down the
centuries, stripped of the veneer which civilization had applied to
us. The jungle is an uncanny place when it reaches out its feelers,
and we recognized that night that man had done a lot to drag
himself up from the brute level when he had cleared the land on
which he dwelt in an endeavour to fight himself free of the
thraldom of jungle growth.</p>

<p>Chico got to his feet with the intention of joining in that
barbaric procession, but Templeton seized him by the ankle and
jerked him down again. The Britisher had seen the danger of the
surroundings, and he had taken a grip of himself. He guessed that
the curious marching music, the sight of the Sword, and, above all,
the mystery in the night would ruin our chances if we were not
careful, and he damned Morgan and me till we worked some of the
poison out of our systems beneath his shower of abuse.</p>

<p>"Don't let the thing get a grip on you!" he growled. "There's
madness here! You're breathing it with every breath! Sit quiet a
moment, and we might get a chance at it when they are putting it
back."</p>

<p>The Spotted Panther, in the centre of the struggling mob, was
halfway across the clearing, and we wriggled closer to the door of
the cave. The bull-roarer was still sounding in the village, and
the night seemed full of deviltry. Every time that we, in an effort
to keep a clutch upon our sanity, tried to send our thoughts across
the ocean to the bright lights and the clean people at home, we
were jerked back to the jungle by the clamour and the odours. We
couldn't escape the place. We became convinced that the only living
persons in the world were those savages on the shores of the
Million Mouths of Boorsh, and the three of us that were risking our
lives&mdash;ay, and our souls&mdash;in an endeavour to possess the
wonderful sword.</p>

<p>"What will we do now?" cried Chico. "Here's the door of the
cave."</p>

<p>"Wait!" gasped Templeton. "Wait and see what the demons will
do."</p>

<p>The moon was fighting herself free of the purple mist, and the
headhunters screamed louder when they saw that their ceremony was
bringing forth results. The clearing became a horrible nightmare,
and we were engulfed in the wave of madness.</p>

<p>"There's some one crawling toward us," whispered Chico. "Look
out! There to the left!"</p>

<p>Red rose to his knees and gripped his rifle by the barrel. It
was no time for shooting. One shot would bring the charging
hundreds down upon us, and we would be reduced to a jelly.</p>

<p>The approaching person stopped, then, as we held our breath and
waited for the yell that would bring the mob upon us, a whisper
came through the shadows.</p>

<p>"Leesbon!"</p>

<p>"By the Robe of Siva! It's the Golden One!" muttered Red.</p>

<p>Nao wriggled closer and started to whisper excitedly to
Templeton. Chico and I guessed what her message was about. She was
protesting against our foolhardiness in venturing so close to the
cave, and she was urging Red to retreat as fast as possible. The
Panther had turned at the end of the clearing, and there was not
much time to waste just then.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Chico.</p>

<p>"She wants us to go back," answered Red.</p>

<p>"Tell her we can't," said Morgan. "Thank her, Templeton, thank
her for what she has done for us. Tell her I said she's a splendid
woman. Tell her, man!"</p>

<p>Templeton translated Morgan's message as the procession was
coming across the clearing toward us, but in spite of the nearness
of the danger we turned our eyes upon Nao at that moment. She
crawled toward Chico, who was close to the door of the cave, took
his big hand, kissed it quickly, then turned and slipped away like
a shadow.</p>

<p>"She's&mdash;she's pure metal," stammered Morgan. Then turning
fiercely upon Templeton and me, he said: "Don't forget! If either
one of you two get out of this rumpus alive you must take her back
with you to civilization. If you don't, I'll haunt you!"</p>

<p>The bull-roarer nearly deafened us at that moment. The noise was
infamous. We struggled in a sea of sound that throttled thought.
And the procession was sweeping across the shadow-flecked
clearing.</p>

<p>It was curious that we could think of no definite plan at that
moment. Our brains were incapable of thought. We knew that our
position near the mouth of the cave was one of imminent danger, but
the longing to see the sword and the desire to take advantage of
the opportunity afforded us by the removal of the stone slab made
it impossible for us to tear ourselves away from the spot. We
crouched in the shadows, yet we knew that the spot where we tried
to hide ourselves would soon be covered with the shrieking mob. Our
stupidity was amazing at that moment. The desire to possess the
Sword seemed to blind us to the dangers around us.</p>

<p>It was Chico who recovered himself in time to realize our peril.
The bull-roarer was silent for a single minute, and in that minute
Morgan shook himself free from the spell that we were under.</p>

<p>"We're cut off!" he cried. "What are we up to? We're mad!"</p>

<p>"The sword," muttered Templeton. "Four hundred million people
are waiting for it. The sword!"</p>

<p>Chico got to his feet and gripped Templeton by the arm, "There's
one hope," he whispered. "The cave! Quick! The cave!"</p>

<p>It seems unbelievable that we should have brought ourselves into
a trap like that, but we were crazy with the desire that came of
dreams that appeared to be coming true. We had seen the Sword, and
we thought that something would happen that would surely give us a
chance to obtain possession of it.</p>

<p>Through the dark opening from which the big stone had been
dragged by the panting mob went Chico and Templeton, and I stumbled
on their heels. Morgan was right. The cave offered the only refuge
from the yelling swarm, and as the Panther neared the doorway, we
groped our way blindly into the darkness. We didn't think of how we
would escape from the place, after the slab was put back in
position. I know I didn't, and I am sure that Chico and Red had no
thoughts on the matter just then. We wished to be near the Great
Parang and nothing else seemed to matter. We forgot everything but
the blade in the grip of the Panther's hands, and as we crouched
down in the darkness we were seized with a mad ecstasy at the
thought that in a few minutes we would be alone with the thing for
which we had risked so much.</p>

<p>The Panther reached the doorway, and the yells came into the
cave and woke the echoes of the place. We saw the blade flash in
the moonlight as it was lowered at the door, and we knew that its
bearer and a score or more of his followers were then in our
hiding-place. We didn't breathe. We jammed ourselves against the
rocky sides of the place and tried to still the mad pounding of our
hearts. We cursed the ticking of Templeton's watch in the silence
that followed the entry of the sword bearer. The bull-roarer became
silent, the yells subsided, and nothing but the heavy breathing and
the soft shuffling of naked feet disturbed the silence.</p>

<p>We felt the heat of their presence as they passed close to us.
They were very close. The handle of a spear knocked against my
knee, and I shivered.</p>

<p>We were near to the realization of all our hopes, and yet we
were chilled by the knowledge that the retreat of the Panther and
his bodyguard would be followed by the closing of the entrance. But
we would not have made an effort to leave that place if the door
was unguarded. We were held there by a lust for possession that was
stronger than the desire for life itself.</p>

<p>The Panther and his guard halted within ten feet of us. We heard
the chink of metal against stone. What a thrill that sound brought
to us! Then the bodies shuffled slowly by, passed through the
opening of the cave, and out into the clearing. There was a moment
of quiet, then the voice of the leader roared an order, and with
shouts and screams the big stone slab was hauled into place.</p>

<p>"Glory be!" breathed Chico. "We're locked in, but we're locked
in with the thing we have been dreaming of!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="chaphead">A White Claw</p>

<p class="first"><br>
NOW that I review the moments which followed the closing of the
cave, I marvel at the accuracy we displayed in locating that spot
from which had come the chink of metal upon stone. It was
extraordinary. The spot was over ten feet from our hiding-place,
and the cave was as black as the heart of a junk pirate, yet we
stepped toward it with a certainty that seemed to be born of
something stronger than the sense of direction acquired from the
sound made when the sword struck the block of stone upon which it
rested. Our three outstretched hands touched metal at the same
moment, and with a cry of joy we sank upon our knees beside the
stone slab. We were touching the Parang of Buddha, the wonder blade
of the world!</p>

<p>"It's it!" cried Templeton, and Chico and I repeated the words
as our fingers slipped up and down the flat of the great blade.</p>

<p>"It's it! It's it!" we echoed.</p>

<p>"We've got it at last!" gasped Templeton.</p>

<p>"At last! At last!" shouted Chico. "Glory be! We've got it at
last!"</p>

<p>We were hysterical as we crouched there and fondled that thing.
We thought of nothing but it. It was everything to us. It filled
our hearts and pushed every other desire and craving into the
background. We wept over it, and now and then we cursed it for the
madness it brought upon us.</p>

<p>"We'll stir the world," babbled Chico. "We'll set the East
ablaze."</p>

<p>"And they're my people!" cried Templeton. "The British, I mean!
And this thing&mdash;this thing, Morgan, will push them out of
India! It will, I tell you! It will!"</p>

<p>"What does it matter to us?" snapped Chico. "We've found it! You
and Lenford and I found it, and we don't care what it does to
others as long as it brings everything to us."</p>

<p>God alone knows how long we lay in the dark beside that stone,
our fingers moving up and down the tremendous blade. Courtney, the
opium fiend, obtained no such delight from his pipe as we got from
the contact of our fingers with that wonderfully smooth blade. It
thrust out of our minds all thoughts of the other things that Gung
had spoken of. The Sword, like the Chalice of Everlasting Fire,
seemed to thrill with life, and we could not leave it for an
instant.</p>

<p>"Let us take it to the crevice in the wall," said Chico. "The
moonlight streams in there, and we can examine it better."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," cried Red. "Here, let me carry it. I have the
handle."</p>

<p>It was then we learned of the tremendous strength of the Spotted
Panther. We heard Red struggling with that blade in the darkness,
then he cursed softly and spoke to us.</p>

<p>"Didn't the Panther carry it with one hand?" he asked.</p>

<p>"With one hand," I answered. "At least he carried it out of the
cave with one hand."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't lift it with one hand," said Red. "You have a
try, Morgan. If that brute can juggle with this with one hand he
must have the strength of a Samson."</p>

<p>Chico stumbled' round the table and made an attempt to lift the
blade with one hand, but he was as unsuccessful as Red.</p>

<p>"He must have the arm of Thor," muttered Morgan. "It's quite a
weight to handle with two hands."</p>

<p>Chico carried the blade toward the crevice in the wall, through
which the moonlight was streaming, and we followed him. What a
sword it was! When Morgan put its point down upon the floor and
held it in the white beams that came through the opening, we stood
and stared at it till our teeth chattered from nervousness. It was
a great blade. It flung up dreams of wonder things, and as the rays
washed its naked length in a bath of silver, we felt that it was a
blade that Odin might have gripped as he toasted the heroes in
Walhalla. We knew that it had done great things. We were sure it
had. The air seemed to be charged with stories of its deeds, and we
gathered them in through our skins. We were in a state of mind that
would have made us feel little astonishment if that wonder sword
had started to tell its history to us.</p>

<p>The emerald handle made our throats feel dry as we examined it,
and the twisted cobra was a glorious piece of workmanship.</p>

<p>"It was all as we said," muttered Chico. "The golden cobra and
the weight and height. See, it is up to my chin."</p>

<p>"And the verse upon the blade," said Templeton. "Here it is in
Hindustanee! God be good to us, we're made! We're princes! We're
greater than all the rajahs of the thirteen tributary states of
India!"</p>

<p>Chico Morgan and I just stood there and looked and looked. But
Red Templeton was inspired at that moment. He surely was. He put
his hand on the golden cobra of the hilt and he started to chant of
India like the blind fakir at the door of the Dilwara Temple. We
never can tell what will come out of the recesses of the brain.
Never! Templeton didn't know that he was the possessor of the
information he flung at us that night. I'm doubtful if he knows to
this day what he said. But I wish I could write it all down here.
It might make historians think.</p>

<p>He chanted of Mahmud and Altmish, of Genghis Khan and the
Toghlak kings. He told of battle and fire, of pillage and
slaughter, of death and deviltry, and that big sword seemed to have
a part in everything that he spoke of. He didn't mention the sword,
but we knew. There is magic in the air of the East. When he told
how the Tartar Timur galloped his big black horse over the praying
women in front of Delhi, that sword seemed to thrill in the hands
of Templeton. We knew that Timur carried that big sword as he
galloped up the slope. We knew in a way that I cannot explain.</p>

<p>He chanted stories of monasteries where treasure of gold and
silver and precious stones were guarded by the greasy monks in the
yellow robes of Buddhist priests. And we knew that the big parang
was among those treasures. Once at the Golden Wat at Bangkok I had
heard a Shan priest speak to a jade Buddha like Templeton spoke to
that sword. The Shan was inspired for the moment, and so was Red.
We believed everything he said, and we could believe it before all
the statements made by spectacled historians who try and piece
together the doings of yesterday. It was wonderful!</p>

<p>When he finished we stood around the sword like three obsessed
men, fingering it gently, and slowly turning it so that its
polished blade could drink up the white light that the
scared-looking moon was pouring into the place. And we didn't waste
a thought up to that moment as to how we would get out of that
place. The intoxication produced by the possession of the weapon
made us forget the great slab of stone that barred our way to
liberty. There was no room for other thoughts to get into our
brain. We could only think of the sword and the mental pictures
which Templeton's chant conjured up.</p>

<p>"We'll be princes!" said Chico.</p>

<p>"Ay!" I cried. "I dreamed that we would be princes on the night
the White <i>Mias</i> stampeded the Dyaks at the Place of Evil
Winds."</p>

<p>"And the English will suffer," muttered Temple-ton. "They'll
suffer when the news spreads like a flame from Howrah to Peshawur.
And the English are my people."</p>

<p>"We might make a deal with them," said Chico. "The three of us
and Nao&mdash;Nao is in the deal, you know. We might sell it to
them for millions. What if I struck Broadway with a million,
Lenford? If we got a million each, boy!"</p>

<p>"But the English are my people," persisted Templeton. "And this
will push them into the Bay of Bengal."</p>

<p>"If they don't make a deal with us," growled Morgan. "We've
earned it and we are willing to stop trouble if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Chico stopped and stared at the crevice in the wall of the cave.
The moonlight had been suddenly shut off, and for the moment we
were unable to discern the reason.</p>

<p>"It's Nao!" cried Morgan. "Speak to her, Red! She has come to
see what has happened to us."</p>

<p>It was the Golden One who was peering in through the opening,
and she expressed her joy when she discovered that we were alive. I
think that the pleasure she derived from hearing Morgan's voice
brought her more delight than any news regarding Red or myself, but
we were not annoyed at the preference. Chico had saved the girl's
life when the Tring had attempted to make her a target for his
blowpipe, so it was natural that she should be interested in his
welfare.</p>

<p>"Tell her she's a partner in the sword," shouted Morgan. "Tell
her what it's worth, Red! She'll be able to buy half of Portugal
when we cash in!"</p>

<p>Templeton spoke to the girl as she cried excited questions into
the opening. The sword didn't seem to trouble Nao at that
moment.</p>

<p>"She wants to know how we are going to get out of this place,"
said Red. "She thinks we are imprisoned for all time. The slab
can't be moved from the inside."</p>

<p>"The slab?" muttered Chico, as if he was endeavouring to recall
something that had slipped from his mind. "Oh, yes! Tell her we'll
get out, Red. Tell her not to worry. The Lord never led us to this
blade without providing a way to get us out of the place."</p>

<p>"She can't see it with your eyes," said Templeton. "She thinks
that the Panther will either discover our presence and starve us to
death or that they'll tumble in on us the next time the moon turns
red."</p>

<p>"Let them," cried Morgan. "I feel that we're going to get out of
this box. I'm sure that we will. I've got a hunch, and I'm not
troubling three cents. Tell her what I say, Templeton."</p>

<p>Red started to explain Chico's opinions to the girl, but while
he was still speaking the girl gave a little shriek of horror and
dashed across the clearing in the direction of the <i>kampong</i>.
We could see her distinctly while she was in line with the crevice
in the rocky wall of the cave, and we watched her with wide-open
eyes as she plunged into the trees and disappeared.</p>

<p>"What is the matter now?" gasped Chico.</p>

<p>"She must have seen some one," whispered Templeton. "She saw
somebody over there to the right. I saw the fear sweep over her
face when she turned and bolted for the village."</p>

<p>That happening made us think of our position, and a feeling of
helplessness stole over us as we peered through the narrow crevice
at the moonlit clearing. If the Golden One had put herself in
danger by allying herself with us, we were unable to give her the
slightest help, and for a few moments we forgot the Great Sword of
Buddha as we guessed blindly at the reason for her mad rush across
the cleared space.</p>

<p>"It might be the Panther," muttered Templeton. "He was wandering
around here the night we struck this place."</p>

<p>Chico cursed softly as he twisted his neck in a vain endeavour
to see the shadowy clumps to the right. "Hold the sword for a
moment!" he cried.</p>

<p>"I'll try and get a better look by climbing up here." Templeton
took the Great Sword, while Morgan endeavoured to get a better look
at the clearing by climbing upon a rock and peering through a part
of the crevice that was a little wider than the portion that was
directly upon the level of our eyes. Not a sound came from the
outside. A silence hung over the village, and not a breath of air
disturbed the trees.</p>

<p>Chico, hanging to the rocky projections, thrust his face against
the crevice while we stood and watched him.</p>

<p>"Can you see anything?" asked Templeton. "Whatever it was it
is&mdash;Great God!"</p>

<p>Red's shriek followed the devilish snarl that came from the
outside. Chico Morgan lost his grip upon the rock and toppled
backward, but as he was falling, a white paw slipped through the
aperture with the speed of lighting, and Chico's arm was caught in
a clutch of steel.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he shouted. "The sword!"</p>

<p>It was Red Templeton whose iron nerves were not upset by the
happening and who was able to obey Morgan's order. The big
Englishman lifted the Great Parang of Buddha and brought it down on
that snaky, muscular claw that held Chico with an ease that
terrified us.</p>

<p>The big blade cut through the white paw as if it were a straw
and as Morgan stumbled back from the opening, a howl of fury ripped
through the night. It was a terrible cry. It went out across the
jungle like a lariat of sound, and for a few seconds we stood still
and listened. Then Red spoke.</p>

<p>"Did you see?" he asked. "Was it that?"</p>

<p>Chico kicked the hairy claw into the strip of moonlight upon the
stone floor. "It was the White <i>Mias</i>," he said quietly. "The
infernal brute reached for me with the speed of a rattler. Listen!
They're moving in the village, and that thing will leave a trail of
blood to show them where it was injured!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="chaphead">Nine Heads</p>

<p class="first"><br>
WHETHER the <i>kampong</i> had been aroused by the weird cry, or
whether the Golden One or the sentinel had given the alarm, we
could not tell, but Chico spoke the truth when he said that the
people of the Spotted Panther were moving. We surmised, though,
that they were really ignorant of the near presence of the White
<i>Mias</i>. Nao had informed us that the people of the village
held the brute in great fear, and that this fear kept them in their
attap houses after a certain hour, so that when we heard them
crashing through the trees in the direction of the cave we credited
their courage to ignorance.</p>

<p>"If they see the thing they'll break their necks racing for
shelter," said Chico. "Golly! she has a grip that made me feel like
a toy terrier in the mouth of a mastiff!"</p>

<p>The headhunters broke from cover and came across the clearing
yelling like fiends. The Panther was in the lead, and near him was
his muscular lieutenant. Behind them surged the naked warriors,
while women and children ran with the men and increased the
racket.</p>

<p>"Get back in the shadow," cried Templeton. "They're bound to
peep in."</p>

<p>With Red carrying the Great Sword, we moved back from the
crevice and stood listening to the yells. The mob came straight for
the cave. They surged against it like a black wave, scurried this
way and that, then stopped as a terrific shout went up from the
Panther.</p>

<p><i>"Mias!"</i> he screamed. <i>"Aintu mias!"</i></p>

<p>A silence gripped the mob as they packed closer round the
crevice. The Panther had found the blood of the ghostly orang-utan
and his followers crushed together in their fear. At the rear of
the crowd some women and children started to sob wildly, but their
sobs were suppressed as the leader shrieked an order to the
men.</p>

<p>Red Templeton understood the meaning of that order. With a
little cry of warning he turned toward the stone slab upon which we
had discovered the sword, and Chico and I stumbled after him.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked Morgan.</p>

<p>"They're coming into this place!" answered Red. "We must put the
sword back upon the stone and hide in the back of the cave.
Quick!"</p>

<p>"But they might take the sword to the village!" protested
Chico.</p>

<p>"No, no!" snapped Templeton. "They're wondering how the blood
came to be on the rocks outside, and they're coming in to
look."</p>

<p>"But the paw?" whispered Chico.</p>

<p>"Leave it there! Hurry! They're moving the door!"</p>

<p>Templeton put the Great Sword upon the stone from which we had
taken it, then we stumbled blindly into the farthest corner of the
cave. The cavern ran back a considerable distance, and we were
fully thirty yards from the opening when the slab was pushed aside,
and the Panther, carrying a torch of resin wood, stalked into the
place with the mob at his heels.</p>

<p>The masked leader led the way to the crevice in the rock, and we
crouched behind a projecting shelf and watched the torch bobbing up
and down. We were certain now that the white paw which Templeton
had sliced off the brute that gripped Chico would be discovered,
and we wondered stupidly what discoveries would follow the
find.</p>

<p>The Panther stopped, lifted his torch high in the air, and then
chilled our blood by giving vent to a moan of supreme terror that
was taken up by his bodyguard and then by the crowd in the
clearing.</p>

<p>It was an infamous cry. It made our teeth chatter with the
thoughts of the agony it told of. It conjured up visions of
witches, of devils, of things terrible and terrifying that the
silent jungles had bred in the minds of the Kyans.</p>

<p>The Panther moaned again and again, and we fidgeted uneasily. I
had a mad desire to stand up and scream a protest against the
strange whine of fear, and I am sure that Templeton and Morgan had
the same inclination. The peculiar outcry was creating an
atmosphere like the one manufactured by Gung and the ten Dyaks at
the Place of Evil Winds.</p>

<p>The big leader turned suddenly from the contemplation of the
severed claw and rushed toward the stone slab upon which rested the
Great Parang of Buddha, and we held our breath. The torch was held
low over the big sword, then with a wild yell of terror the Panther
dashed for the door, and the screaming bodyguard followed him. They
had seen the blood upon the big blade, and fear gripped them with a
clutch that was more terrible than death itself!</p>

<p>"Be ready!" whispered Templeton. "They might forget the
slab."</p>

<p>But that was one thing which the terrified mob was not likely to
forget. It was evident to them that an <i>aintu</i>, or hill
spirit, had used the sword to cut off the paw of the White
<i>Mias</i>, and as the evil spirit must be in the cave, it was
their duty to keep it there. As we sprang to our feet in readiness
to dash out of the opening in case the first shock of terror would
carry the crowd back to the <i>kampong</i>, the big stone slab was
pushed into place, and we were prisoners again.</p>

<p>"What a scare it gave them!" said Chico. "Listen! They're
running for the village at full speed."</p>

<p>"It hasn't done us much good," muttered Templeton. "They won't
open this place for another ten years. They think that a spirit
used the Sword to clip off the paw of the orang-utan, and you can
bet your last dollar that they have no desire to get close to the
spirit."</p>

<p>Morgan was alongside the stone slab upon which was the Sword,
and the fascination exercised by the wonderful blade made
Templeton's words have little effect upon him. And I don't think
Templeton thought much of how we were going to get out of the place
when he came back to the glorious weapon. We could think of nothing
but its beauty when we came near, and we fingered it lovingly as we
gathered round it.</p>

<p>"We'll get out when the time comes," muttered Chico. "We'll get
out all right. Do you know&mdash;don't think I'm mad when I tell
you this&mdash;but this blade seems to tell me that we'll get out
with it."</p>

<p>"I have the same feeling," said Templeton. "It tells me the
same."</p>

<p>"And I feel as you two do," I stammered.</p>

<p>"What did that verse say that you could do everything with?"
asked Chico.</p>

<p>"With Faith," answered Red. "It is here on the blade. Can't you
feel the letters with your fingertips? And it's the truth. It
says:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Ocean and sea and swift river,<br>
Mountain, volcano and hill<br>
Slow-circling planets and Stardust&mdash;<br>
With <b>Faith</b> I can build them at will."</p>
<br>

<p>"Well, I'm a perpetual fountain of faith," said Morgan. "I'm
going to take this sword to Banjermassin if ten million Dyaks were
in the way. Then we'll tote it over to Benares, and we'll charge
ten rupees a head for every blamed Buddhist to get a peep at it.
How many of them did you reckon there was, Red?"</p>

<p>"There are four hundred million Buddhists in the East," answered
Templeton. "That's the lowest estimate of the number in India,
China, Tibet, and Japan."</p>

<p>"Then we'll travel with it," said Chico. "We'll have old P. T.
Barnum's reputation looking like a wet cruller. Four hundred
millions at ten rupees apiece! And only four of us in the
partnership!"</p>

<p>Red picked up the Great Parang and moved over to the crevice
where the moonlight would allow us to feast our eyes again upon its
beauty. The touch of it thrilled us, but the sight of it maddened
us. It was a thousand times more impressive than the Chalice of
Everlasting Fire. The chalice was beautiful, but the big blade
seemed to be the abode of power and force. We knew that the hands
of princes and emperors&mdash;ay, and of the Great Buddha
himself&mdash;had gripped the emerald handle, and that the golden
cobra had felt the swelling muscles of men who had built their
thrones upon the smouldering ruins of empires they destroyed. Glory
be! it was wonderful! Things that Chico and I knew nothing of
thrust themselves into our minds as we looked at it. It conjured up
dreams of battles. We saw charging hosts&mdash;Mongols and Tartars,
Pathans and Rajputs, bloody Mahommedans and wild-eyed Sikhs. We
were crazy men just then. That blade brought up visions of fights
that had never been written of, of battles where men who knew not
fear went singing to their death behind a leader who swung the
sword.</p>

<p>It must have been long after midnight when Red took another look
at the clearing. And it was lucky for us that he made that
examination. Coming toward the crevice, each armed with a deadly
blowpipe, were the Spotted Panther and his big lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Get under cover!" cried Chico. "They've got over their fright,
and they'll send darts into this place till there won't be a square
inch without a puncture."</p>

<p>Morgan grabbed the big sword, and, with Red and me behind him,
went stumbling back into the dark recesses of the place. A revolver
did not appear to us as half so deadly a weapon as the silent
blowpipe. We recalled as we hurried into the darkness, the sudden
manner in which the whining man-hound had departed for a better
world on the morning before, and we lost no time in moving out of
range.</p>

<p>We heard the voice of the two giants at the opening as we groped
our way forward. The floor of the cave was uneven, and this nearly
proved our undoing. Chico, carrying the sword, stumbled and fell,
and while Red and I stooped to give him a helping hand, something
that made a sound like the buzzing of a small fly, whipped between
our two heads.</p>

<p>"Get down and crawl!" whispered Templeton. "On your knees! On
your knees!"</p>

<p>I got lower than my knees. I squirmed along on my stomach,
filled with terror lest one of the unseen darts would find me. It
was not exactly death that we feared at that moment. We had faced
death before, but we had never faced it with such a wonderful
treasure in our possession. We were horrified at the thought of
death now that the Great Sword was in our hands.</p>

<p>"Keep moving," whispered Chico. "We'll be out range
directly."</p>

<p>We struck the rear wall of the cave and crawled along it,
feeling blindly for a niche of some kind into which we could thrust
ourselves for protection. Our sixth sense told us that we were
still in range of the deadly blowpipes, and the wet wall seemed
mighty unsympathetic as we clawed at it in an effort to find
shelter.</p>

<p>Chico Morgan stopped after we had been fingering that rock for
about ten minutes, and he poked around in the darkness.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked Red.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for something," whispered Chico. "Say, how many
heads did I poke into that hole in the floor of the little cave on
the cliff."</p>

<p>"Nine," I answered.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" asked Morgan.</p>

<p>"Certain."</p>

<p>"Well, they're here," breathed Morgan. "I found them by their
odour. Nine heads, all in a row. It looks as if the water had worn
a passage through the soft limestone from the little cave down into
this place."</p>

<p>Templeton and I felt our way to Chico's side and fingered the
heads. We counted them half a dozen times. There were nine, sure
enough, and although we carefully searched the immediate vicinity
we could find no others.</p>

<p>"But there's nothing to it," whispered Red. "It's just a
coincidence."</p>

<p>"Not so," protested Chico. "I know the infernal smell of these
skulls. I'll wager that they're the same batch."</p>

<p>"And if they are, what good will it do us?" asked Templeton.
"The hole isn't large enough for a boy to crawl through."</p>

<p>"But the sandstone is rotten," breathed Chico. "Spirits o'
nitre! there's a hope! The little cave in the cliff must be
directly above this spot, and if these heads rolled down through
the passage there's a possibility of our climbing back through
it."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The Passage In The Cliff</p>

<p class="first"><br>
MORGAN'S argument brought hope. The fact that the number of heads
upon the floor in the cave corresponded with the number Chico had
thrust down the hole appeared to be something more than a mere
coincidence, and we groped madly around in search of an opening in
the wall.</p>

<p>"They didn't come through the roof, if they came at all,"
muttered Chico. "If they had fallen through the roof they would
have bounced in all directions. The passage is in the side
wall."</p>

<p>Our fingers were bleeding as we rubbed them over the wet wall.
At the other end of the cave we could see the thin strip of
moonlight where the Panther and his lieutenant were busy with their
blowpipes, and we knew that they had knowledge of our position.
Their deep whispers came to us, and we sensed the flying death upon
the atmosphere.</p>

<p>It was Red Templeton who discovered the passage down which the
nine heads had rolled from the little cave up on the cliffside. The
opening was about five feet from the floor, and it was so narrow
that a grown man could not get his shoulders inside. But the
sandstone was so soft that it broke away in large pieces when we
touched it with our hands.</p>

<p>"We must make it larger," breathed Templeton. "If we could get
back to the small cave we could escape across the morass to-morrow
night. Wouldn't it be great!"</p>

<p>"It would," Chico muttered, as he clawed at the wall with one
hand while he grabbed the big blade with the other. "It would be
splendid! If we could get this sword to Benares, boys! Tear into
it! We've got to get out!"</p>

<p>A thrill swept over us then, and we forgot the pair at the
crevice. We tried to remember them, but we couldn't. We tried to
keep our voices down, but the wine of victory intoxicated us, and
we shouted encouragement to each other. That sword must have made a
thousand victors. The man who had it in his possession could not
possibly be a craven. It brought confidence, power, victory. We
could understand how the Tartar Timur had galloped his big black
horse to the gates of Delhi when he had that blade in his hands. It
filled him with such courage that he would have galloped to the
gates of Hades and challenged the Evil Spirits to mortal
combat.</p>

<p>We worked like madmen in tearing away the soft sandstone. It.
came away in masses, and Templeton crawled up into the opening and
thrust the rock back with hands and feet.</p>

<p>"Go after him, Lenford!" ordered Chico. "I've got the sword, so
I'll go last."</p>

<p>I crawled into the burrow behind Red, and although I was nearly
smothered by the avalanche of sand he flung back upon me, I held to
my task of thrusting it back into the cavern to make room for what
he dislodged. We couldn't speak. The dust choked us, but as we
scratched and scraped in that passage our thoughts went out across
the China Sea and the Indian Ocean to the Temple at Benares, where
our minds pictured the hundreds of thousands who would gather to
see the wonder blade we had brought from its hiding-place.</p>

<p>Red Templeton stopped scratching and called a question to
me.</p>

<p>"Is Morgan in the burrow?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I answered. "I'll speak to him."</p>

<p>I turned my head and called out to Chico, but I got no answer,
so I slipped back over the dirt into the cave.</p>

<p>"Morgan," I whispered. "Where are you?"</p>

<p>A gurgle came from the darkness, and I dropped upon my knees and
felt around. That gurgle terrified me. I knew that Chico had been
wounded, but, curiously, the fear that came to me was not from the
knowledge of Morgan's danger. I was afraid that the sword might
have been taken from him after he had been struck down. Chico was
my friend, but the Great Sword of Buddha was more to me at that
moment than any friend.</p>

<p>I found Morgan upon the floor, breathing heavily, and when I
clutched his arms to find out if he still possessed the sword, I
discovered that the right hand was wet and sticky. The left gripped
the big emerald handle, and as I shook him gently, my brain told me
what had happened. I caught the wet hand and checked the guess
which my mind had made. A dart from the deadly blowpipes had
pierced the first finger of Chico's right hand, and knowing that
death would follow if he did not act quickly he had sliced off the
finger with the big parang. I knew that he had either fainted from
the loss of blood, or else was in a comatose condition produced by
the small amount of poison which had entered his system before he
amputated his finger.</p>

<p>Before I had time to bind up the wound, Red Templeton was beside
me.</p>

<p>"What is wrong?" he whispered.</p>

<p>I explained the situation, and Red endeavoured to rouse Chico
while I bound the thumb with rough bandages I made from the sleeves
of my shirt.</p>

<p>"Wake up, Morgan," whispered Templeton. "Wake up, man! You're
not hurt."</p>

<p>Chico groaned gently, rolled over on his side and tried to move
his legs. "They feel dead," he gasped. "Could&mdash;could one of
you fellows rub them a moment? The poison from that dart made me
feel as dead as a lump of wood."</p>

<p>"It'll wear off after a few minutes," said Templeton. "You were
lucky you got the thing in your finger."</p>

<p>Red and I rubbed vigorously at Chico's arms and legs, and after
about five minutes' hard work on our part, the circulation
improved. The numbness left his limbs, and with Templeton and me
supporting him, we managed to get him into the passage.</p>

<p>"Give me the Sword," said Red. "I'll go first, and Lenford can
push you from the rear."</p>

<p>"No, I'll carry the blade," muttered Chico. "I'm all right now.
The stuff they dip those darts into must be strong! It had hardly
whipped into my finger before all the blood in my body turned to
lead."</p>

<p>We felt safe from those infernal poisoned darts when we crept
into the passage, even if there was a bit of scratching to be done
before we could reach the cave on the cliff.</p>

<p>"I believe we'll get there," whispered Templeton. "I feel a
freshness in the air."</p>

<p>We worked like madmen! We tore at that soft stone till our
finger nails were broken and bleeding. Lying on our stomachs, we
wormed our way upward, and our thoughts of the Great Sword gave us
a strength that made us think we were able to tear down a mountain.
We didn't stop to picture the difficulties that lay in front of us
when we reached the cave, we only thought of the task of getting
there, and Templeton nearly smothered Chico by the amount of sand
that he thrust back upon him.</p>

<p>"We're nearly there!" he cried. "I can sniff the air of the
dawn. Keep at it. For the love of heaven! keep at it!"</p>

<p>Red was right about the chill of the dawn in the air that came
to us from the direction in which we were climbing. The nine heads
had surely come down by the water-worn passage, which was unknown
to the Spotted Panther and his followers!</p>

<p>"Four hundred million at ten rupees a head!" gasped Chico.
"Don't smother me, Templeton! You'll get enough out of the business
without trying to kill me!"</p>

<p>Red was nearly crazy just then, and Chico and I were as bad. We
sniffed the cold air and we longed to see the dawn-light beating on
the emerald handle, on the hilt made of the twisted cobra, and on
the glory of the golden blade that had torn kings and emperors from
their thrones.</p>

<p>Templeton gave a gurgle of joy, and we knew what had happened.
He had thrust his head up through the opening into which Chico had
stuffed the heads the night before, and, smothered with earth, we
fought our way up and stretched ourselves full length beside him.
Chico laid the great blade lengthwise in front of us, and in the
faint dim light of the dawn we did obeisance to it. We were
infidels then. We knew no God only the god of strength and power
that we sensed in the Great Parang of Buddha.</p>

<p>Chico crawled to the round opening from which we had watched the
human bloodhound twenty-four hours previously&mdash;it seemed
twenty-four years to us just then&mdash;and he looked out toward
the village and the Mouths of Boorsh.</p>

<p>"Do you think we could do it?" questioned Red. "Could we creep
down to the marsh and get away before sunrise?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," answered Morgan. "It would be a narrow
squeeze. Besides&mdash;besides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Besides what?" asked Templeton.</p>

<p>"There's Nao," said Chico quietly. "We're not going out of this
spot without her. At least I'm not going."</p>

<p>Templeton looked at the Great Sword for a moment without
speaking. When one forgot his God in looking at that blade, Red's
momentary forgetfulness of the Golden One was not to be wondered
at.</p>

<p>"We could wait for her on the other side of the morass," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"There'll be no waiting game for us when we leave here," snapped
Chico. "Besides, we'd never get across the Mouths of Boorsh if she
wasn't there to guide us."</p>

<p>That sounded like gospel truth to Templeton and me. Morgan's
remark brought up a vision of the squealing boar and the circular
mouths fringed with the green slimy moss&mdash;the mouths that
quivered as we walked near them, as if they were hungry for
something to devour.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have to put in another day here," said Templeton
quietly. "I hope the fiends don't locate us, although I've got a
feeling in my bones that they will."</p>

<p>I had the same feeling as I lay on the floor of the little cave
and fingered the blade, waiting anxiously for the sun to rise so
that the full beauty of the thing might be shown to us. We had only
seen it in the moonlight, but it was never made to be examined by
the moonlight. It was to be seen only when the blazing sun flashed
upon its glorious length of blade, and the great cobra and the
magnificent emerald fed upon the sunbeams.</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll have to wait," said Chico. "They're stirring already
in the village, and we're not in the humour for a ten-mile run with
a few hundred niggers after us."</p>

<p>Templeton brought the Great Parang close to the opening, and as
the pink blush crept into the eastern sky, we knelt beside it and
marvelled as the beauty of the workmanship was made plainer as the
light increased. There was never a blade in all the world like that
blade. There couldn't be. As we sat and stared at it we knew it to
be the subject of half the battle songs of the East. We knew! The
great emerald of the handle that fitted into the mouth of the
golden cobra we recognized as the emerald which the holy Hussan saw
drop from the seventh heaven when the soul of the Yogi entered,
while the cobra brought back to our minds the stories which the
Shans tell of the hamadryad of Gautama that saps the courage of all
who look upon it. We could understand how the courage of a man
would be sucked up when he saw the Sword swinging before his
eyes.</p>

<p>But it was the blade itself&mdash;the beautiful, sinuous
blade&mdash; that gripped us, Down its shining length were the
words of the poem that Gung had recited to us, and although the
words were in a tongue that we were ignorant of, we felt that we
could have read them if Gung had never told us of their meaning.
That was curious. Chico followed the inlaid words with his fingers,
chanting the verse softly as he moved his hand down the blade, and
we had the same opinion as Morgan as to where each line ended. Red
and I joined in with him as he reached the last two lines, and just
as the rim of the golden sun peeped above the green swath of
jungle, we spoke them together:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Slow-circling planets and star-dust,<br>
With <b>Faith</b> I can build them at will."</p>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The Challenge</p>

<p class="first"><br>
THERE was something strange about the morning which broke upon us
as we lay in that little cave on the cliff side. Perhaps it was the
possession of the Great Parang that made us feel that it was a
morning totally different from any that we had lived. Perhaps our
covetousness had changed us so that we saw signs that we had never
looked for before. But whatever it was that brought the feeling, we
could not rid ourselves of it, and with faces filthy with blood and
perspiration we lay at the mouth of the cave and watched and
waited. We had not eaten anything since noon of the previous day,
and our throats were parched with thirst.</p>

<p>"I feel as if something is going to happen," said Chico. "I've
got an itch in the soles of my feet, and I get that always on
red-letter days. Don't you remember that I had the feeling on the
morning the crew of the <i>Happy Prince</i> mutinied, Lenford?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did," I answered.</p>

<p>"Sure, I did," said Chico. "I get hunches about big happenings,
and I've got one right now."</p>

<p>"I think we should have chanced the morass," remarked Templeton.
"If they find the sword has been taken from the cave they'll rake
every inch of this country in search of it."</p>

<p>"Let them," snarled Chico. "We've got the treasure, and we've
got a few cartridges that will make it awkward for any one who
attempts to get it back in a hurry. And we've got something else,
Red. Do you know what it is?"</p>

<p>"Faith," answered Templeton.</p>

<p>"Ay, Faith!" cried Chico. "What does that verse say it has done?
That's it! 'Hurled up the mountains that whisper a litany sweet to
the sun!' Why I feel as if I could raid the <i>kampong</i> with
this blade. We won't put it in a temple, Red. We won't! We'll go
and conquer a kingdom with it. Gee! it was made for conquerors, not
for greasy I pilgrims to maul with their sweaty fingers."</p>

<p>We thought the same as Chico. That blade looked as if it had
been built for hands that were as sinewy and powerful as those of
Tamerlane and Akbar. Every time we looked at it we seemed to see
bearded chieftains swinging it at the head of squadrons that made
the earth tremble.</p>

<p>A silence fell on us as we sat and waited, a silence that seemed
to be brought about by the stillness of the village. It seemed as
if the people of the Spotted Panther had overslept themselves after
the excitement of the night, and we waited anxiously for some
action that would tell us what they intended to do. It was hardly
possible that they would let the happenings at the cave pass
without investigation, and we stroked the Great Sword and waited
for the moment to arrive. Chico was right about the strength that
one derived from the beautiful blade. When one touched it with the
fingers a flood of courage seemed to flow from it, and the muscles
of the arms grew tense as if they responded to a call which the
Sword had given. It wanted a conqueror to swing it, a conqueror
whose muscular hand would press against the gold cobra whose hooded
head bit at the emerald.</p>

<p>"The blood of the White <i>Mias</i> is the only stain on it,"
said Templeton.</p>

<p>"And the blood of my finger," added Chico. "It saved my life for
a start. I wouldn't have had the strength to get my knife out of
its sheath."</p>

<p>I made a movement to wipe the bloodstains from the shining
blade, but Templeton stopped me. "Leave them on it," he said. "It
has been so long without blood that it must be thirsty for it. I'm
thirsty, too. I'd give anything for a quart of water."</p>

<p>"Nao might locate us after a while," murmured Chico hopefully.
"She'll be looking for&mdash;&mdash;Here they come!"</p>

<p>Morgan didn't see the crowd when he spoke. He only heard the
peculiar cry which the mob had given vent to when they followed the
Panther L their efforts to allay the anger of the <i>aintus</i>
which they saw expressed in the Moon of Blood. But that strange
chant was enough to put us on the alert. It was a chant of fear, of
terror, of concentrated awe, and we understood they had but waited
for the sunrise to make an investigation of the cave.</p>

<p>The Panther and his big lieutenant led the crouching, whining
headhunters. They came on to the clearing with heads lowered,
bodies inclined forward, and the left hand of each placed above the
eyes as if to shield them from any fearful sight which might appear
suddenly before them. Across the green space they streamed, a horde
of greasy fiends, the Panther leading them straight for the stone
slab which they had hurriedly put into place when they fled the
cave.</p>

<p>"We're in for it now," growled Chico. "The big fellow has
convinced them that there's something more than spirits in the
cave."</p>

<p>"It seems like it," assented Red. "They'll find the sword has
disappeared, and then particular Sheol will break out around this
neighbourhood."</p>

<p>The impending trouble weighed upon us like a heavy hand. We had
recovered the sword, but it looked as if all our work would be in
vain. The procession that filed toward the mouth of the cave made
us realize our weakness, and Banjermassin seemed to be a million
miles away.</p>

<p>"They'll find the passage," murmured Chico.</p>

<p>"Sure they'll find it," said Red.</p>

<p>"And they'll find us."</p>

<p>"We can't help it," said Templeton.</p>

<p>"And they'll take the sword," muttered Morgan.</p>

<p>"After we've lessened the population of their village," cried
Red. "Let them come!"</p>

<p>The big slab was moved aside by two hundred sinewy hands, and
into the cave dashed the head-hunters. The chant of fear became
louder as they came closer to the supposed haunt of the evil
spirits, and we waited breathlessly for the shout that would tell
of the disappearance of the sword. And that shout came. It rushed
out of the cave like a projectile of sound, and the jungle echoed
with its volume. It was a terrific yell. In the <i>kampong</i> the
women and men took up the cry as if they knew instinctively the
news that it carried, then it died away and a silence fell upon the
mob.</p>

<p>"Now they are on the trail," muttered Chico. "Look out that none
of them sneaks up the passage before we expect them. They move
mighty fast."</p>

<p>Morgan was right in saying that they were on the trail. The
silence that followed the cry of anger told us that the fear had
fled from the investigators and we guessed that the Spotted Panther
had convinced them in some way that the theft of the Great Parang
was the work of human enemies.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they found your finger, Chico," whispered Red. "Well,
we're in for a battle, and may the Almighty be kind to us. The odds
are big enough to earn us some pity."</p>

<p>The women and old men were now pouring on to the clearing, and
in the packed mob we caught a glimpse of the Golden One, her hands
pressed tightly to her head as if horrified by the discovery.
Occasionally her eyes swept the cliff as if she suspected our
presence, but we kept back from the entrance and patiently awaited
developments. Fate had been good to us from the moment we left the
Barito River, and the extraordinary manner in which matters had
shaped themselves for our benefit had given us a confidence that
was out of keeping with the situation. We thought that Destiny had
booked us to bring the Great Parang back to the waiting millions of
the Orient, and this notion became so deep-rooted that we felt that
we had a grievance against Fortune for throwing so many obstacles
in our path.</p>

<p>"Let them come," muttered Morgan. "Let them all come. Old men
and old women. We've got it, and victory is on the side of the
persons who have that in their possession."</p>

<p>I suppose it was the peculiar feeling of power, brought to one
by the ownership of the weapon, that was responsible for the wild
tales that were associated with it. We thought of fivescore stories
which Gung had told us as we sat and watched the surging crowd on
the clearing, and I know that we were all possessed of an insane
feeling that we could stampede the horde if we rushed down the
cliff swinging the big blade above our heads. Gung had said that
the Rajputs called the great weapon, "The Maker of War," and as we
sat there we felt that the Rajputs were right. It was a maker of
war. One could not resist the inclination to cut and thrust when
one gripped the great handle.</p>

<p>Red Templeton, squatting above the hole in the corner, lifted
his hand, and we listened. The Panther's men had struck the trail.
From the burrow that we had enlarged came smothered grunts and
hoarse cries that told a tale.</p>

<p>"They're coming," breathed Templeton. "Glory be! they're
coming!"</p>

<p>His hand reached out for the big parang, but Chico's went in the
same direction.</p>

<p>"Let me!" cried Red.</p>

<p>"But I want to," said Morgan. "My hands are itching to make a
stroke with it."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, then!" muttered Templeton. "Not a downstroke, man!
You might strike the rock with it. Swing it sideways, and I hope
it's the Panther's head you swing it against."</p>

<p>Chico took the sword and crouched upon his knees. His shirt had
been torn from his body in the passage, and he looked as primitive
as the Spotted Panther as he waited for the first head to appear
above the floor. We were not civilized men in that place. The
poison of the jungle had got into us and the veneer of civilization
had been peeled off.</p>

<p>The head of the leading pursuer came up with the sudden jerk of
a jack-in-the-box, and Chico struck. The blade took the headhunter
in his thick neck, and Morgan gave a chuckle of delight.</p>

<p>But the sudden halt of the leader did not daunt those in the
rear. The headless body was pushed up and up by the savages who
were following. Again the big blade swept through the air, but
before it struck, the doomed man yelled a warning and the movement
from below stopped. The second body was drawn back into the
passage, and Chico rose from his knees.</p>

<p>"They'll come from the front now," he said. "They've hauled
number two back to see what struck him."</p>

<p>The three of us moved to the round opening in the front of the
cave, keeping an occasional eye upon the hole in the corner. But
Chico was right in stating that the passage through the floor had
lost all attraction for the naked warriors. A tremendous howl of
rage and wonder came from the cavern in which the Great Parang had
been kept, and the packed masses in the clearing were thrown back
as the Panther and his followers rushed into the open.</p>

<p>"May Allah be good to us!" muttered Templeton. "Here is the
beginning of the end."</p>

<p>"If either of us survive the fight remember Nao," said Chico.
"If any one escapes let him take her and give her a share in the
sword&mdash;that is, if he can get away with the sword."</p>

<p>A thousand pairs of eyes were upon the mouth of our cave at that
moment, and after the Panther had spoken a few words that we could
not understand, a silence spread out over the mob like a wave. It
welled out to the rim of the crowd and choked the jabbering upon
the fringe.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked Chico.</p>

<p>"They want to see us," answered Red. "They're doubtful if we're
spirits or men."</p>

<p>It was the madness that gripped Morgan that made him act as he
did at that moment. He clutched the sword, sprang through the
opening, and standing upon the little ledge in front of the cave
held the big bloodstained blade high in the air. Body o' me! what a
sight he was! He was bare to the waist and his big muscles stood
out like ropes beneath his fair skin. And in the blazing sunlight
of the tropic morning that weapon looked like a tongue of flame
that licked up the sunbeams that rushed toward it. You would
picture such a man and such a blade beneath the walls of Troy, and
as I looked at him I wondered if I was dreaming, and if the trip
with its unbelievable happenings was not the creation of a brain
crazed by jungle fever. But it was all true. Everything around us
was real. The sour odour of the Mouths of Boorsh came to our
nostrils, the old, old smell of the jungle penetrated our
subconscious minds and made us one with our ancestors who fought
the mammoth when the crystalline rocks of Cape Comorin were
new.</p>

<p>"Look out for the blowpipes!" cried Templeton.</p>

<p>"Let them come!" roared Chico. "I'm not afraid of them!"</p>

<p>Red and I knew that he was not boasting. There wasn't a boast in
Chico Morgan. The sword had intoxicated him, and he would have
faced a thousand with it in his hands.</p>

<p>A warrior standing near the Panther lifted his deadly blowpipe
to send a dart, but the masked chief dashed down the blowpipe as a
cry went up from the crowd.</p>

<p><i>"Aintu! Aintu!"</i> they yelled, and the word was followed by
cries of fear as Chico moved the blade slowly from side to
side.</p>

<p>"What has bitten them, Red?" asked Morgan. "What are they
saying?"</p>

<p>Templeton strained his ears to catch the words that were
repeated over and over again; then in a lull of the shouting, the
words came to us in a different tongue but in a voice we knew. It
was the voice of the Golden One, and it was evident that she had
shouted the message for our benefit.</p>

<p>"They think we're spirits!" cried Templeton, translating the
warning shout. "There is blood upon the Great Sword, and only a
spirit could put it there!"</p>

<p>Chico lowered the blade, placed the point of it upon the rock
and rested his chin upon the emerald handle.</p>

<p>"We've got to keep the stunt up," he said. "And you've got to
fan a belief mighty hard to keep it going. Come out and stand
alongside me."</p>

<p>Red and I climbed out of the cave and stood beside Chico, and in
a silence that seemed to put every nerve in our bodies upon a
tension, we looked down at the mob in the clearing. We could not
guess their thoughts at that moment. Their mouths, smeared with the
juice of the betel nut, were wide open, their eyes showing the
terror which gripped them as they stared at Morgan standing upon
the rocky ledge in front of our little cave.</p>

<p>"What's the next move?" asked Chico.</p>

<p>Templeton fingered his rifle and looked at the masked face of
the Panther. The big brute and his lieutenant had worked their way
to the front of the mob, and now stood regarding us from a spot
that was less than twenty yards from the point where we were
standing.</p>

<p>"I hardly know what to do," answered Red. "Personally I'd like
to engage the best guide in the camp and lead the retreat across
the morass."</p>

<p>"We'll have to wait for the darkness to get away," said Chico.
"They'd never let us get clear with it in the daylight. You must
think of something that will keep our heads on our shoulders till
the night falls. Something that will astonish them."</p>

<p>"I could drill a hole in the Panther," whispered Templeton. "And
I'm wondering if it wouldn't be a good idea. The brute doesn't look
as much impressed as the rest of them!"</p>

<p>There was a ripple in the middle of the crowd at that moment,
the men and women were brushed aside, and out from the oily mob
came a hag who seemed as old as the jungle itself. She looked as if
she had started with the world and grown up with it. When we looked
at the lines in her face and the little black eyes that glanced up
at us, our thoughts were of glacial epochs, fossils, stone
hatchets, mastodons, and other things that were around when the
world was young. She was the original Old Woman of the Mountain who
had hooked herself on to the centuries and refused to be shaken
off. By the bones of Methuselah! she was old.</p>

<p>The hag started in to talk to us, speaking in a thin, whining
voice that went through the air like a wire. There wasn't a sound
from the crowd. They stood with open mouths and listened, and Chico
and I glanced at Red and wondered stupidly if his knowledge of the
Dyak tongue allowed him to get a grasp upon the sermon she was
delivering.</p>

<p>"Do you understand any of it?" asked Chico.</p>

<p>"A word here and there," answered Templeton. "We have been
expected for years and years, so she says. There's some prophecy at
the back of it. I don't know what it all means. If we're spirits,
as they think we are, the Mouths of Boorsh are going to close up,
according to her tale."</p>

<p>"I hope they do," said Chico fervently. "We'll get a better run
for home if that blamed place is filled in."</p>

<p>The hag continued without a pause, and the hot sun beat down
upon our bare shoulders till we inwardly damned her eloquence. She
was the greatest female orator we had ever heard of. That speech
must have been packed away in her head for a century, and she had
been praying daily for an opportunity to unloose it.</p>

<p>She finished at last, and Red Templeton breathed a sigh of
relief. "We're safe," he said. "The hag is certain that we are the
three mentioned in the prophecy. You, Morgan, are the particular
bright star that will wave your hand over the Mouths of Boorsh and
make the place as flat and as solid as a billiard table."</p>

<p>The old woman was swallowed up in the crowd, and we waited for
the next turn on the programme. If the belief expressed by her was
general, we were, in luck. If we could communicate with Nao during
the day we could arrange to steal away when night fell upon the
village, and we would be miles on our way to the Barito before
dawn.</p>

<p>"But what are we to do now?" asked Chico. "Do they feed spirits?
I'd give a lot for a plate of rice and a gallon of water."</p>

<p>"They might tell us what the next item is," said Templeton.
"Look, the Panther is going to speak to us."</p>

<p>The big masked brute walked to the spot where the hag had stood,
gripped the handle of his kris with his right hand, and started to
speak slowly. That giant had the deepest voice we had ever heard.
It boomed through the hot air like the heavy bass of a monster
organ. For over three minutes the deep voice belaboured our ears
like a flail of sound, and we were rather pleased when he stopped
speaking.</p>

<p>"What did he say?" asked Chico.</p>

<p>"I couldn't understand him," replied Templeton. "I'm going to
speak to him in Portuguese. He'll get Nao to translate, and we'll
have a chance to say a word to her."</p>

<p>Red had a mighty strong voice, too. When spoke you could hear
him half a mile away, and his words caused a bit of a sensation.
The Panther roared out an order, and next moment the Golden One was
thrust through the crowd till she reached the side of the masked
leader. She looked sweeter than ever at that moment. Her eyes were
lit up with excitement, and the masses of black hair were crowned
with a wreath of tiny white flowers that gave her the air of a
princess. She made no sign that she recognized us, and we preserved
the same attitude.</p>

<p>The Panther repeated his remarks and she translated them into
Portuguese, speaking clearly and without nervousness.</p>

<p>"The big brute doubts us," whispered Red. "He doesn't believe in
the old woman's story."</p>

<p>"Well, what will he do?" asked Chico. "I'd fight him if I could
get a meal for licking him."</p>

<p>The Panther was speaking again, and Templeton listened as Nao
translated.</p>

<p>"You 're going to get your wish quick and sudden," said Red as
the girl finished speaking. "The big savage issues a challenge to a
fight without weapons. He says if we really are spirits that the
one of our number that fights him will surely kill him. If we are
not spirits he will surely kill his opponent."</p>

<p>"I'll fight him," said Chico quietly. "Tell the girl to tell him
so."</p>

<p>"But you don't own the sword," protested Red.</p>

<p>"I hold it," snapped Morgan. "Let me fight him! I'm sure that I
can win!"</p>

<p>Templeton pushed me to the rear and stood beside Chico. "By the
Spear of Siva! he shall have his pick!" he said. "It would be the
safest plan to send a bullet through the brute, but as he's sport
enough to put weapons aside, we're not going to back down!"</p>

<p>Templeton spoke quickly to Nao, and with a look of terror in her
big eyes the girl translated to the Panther.</p>

<p>The savage seemed to grow bigger as he received that message. He
straightened himself till he stood head and shoulders above the
biggest of his followers. And he looked the very incarnation of
strength. Fear of him came upon me as his eyes measured the two
white men standing up unflinchingly on the rocky ledge, and I
protested loudly against the proposition. I was a craven at that
moment.</p>

<p>"Don't fight him!" I cried. "I'll send a bullet into him! Don't!
Don't!"</p>

<p>I lifted the revolver, but Templeton wrenched it from my hand.
"He has barred out weapons," he said quietly. "Let him have a
chance. Keep quiet, Lenford. We'll beat him."</p>

<p>I believe the Panther smiled beneath the bark-cloth mask that
covered his face and neck as he noted my action. For a full minute
he examined the two men, his eyes noting both closely, then he told
his decision to the Golden One. Templeton and I knew which one he
had picked. The girl's face was as white as snow and she wet her
lips in an effort to repeat his words. Three times she essayed to
speak, and three times words failed her, then the Panther decided
to take the matter of acquainting us in his own hands. Striding
halfway up the slope he seized a pebble, which he tossed with such
accuracy that it struck Chico in the chest, and he nodded his head
to show that Morgan was the one he chose to measure his strength
against.</p>

<p>Chico flushed as the pebble struck him, and his eyes blazed.
"I'll kill him for that," he said quietly. "Take the sword,
Templeton. I'm glad&mdash;mighty-glad that he has chosen me."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16" name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The Great Fight</p>

<p class="first">NOW as I start to describe the fight of fights
when Chico Morgan battled with the Spotted Panther on that
memorable morning, I feel again the thousand and one thrills which
came to me after the pebble had been thrown. Chico was my friend.
He had been my shipmate for seven years. Together we had ploughed
the seven seas and sat in the camps of the rim. Furthermore, and
that knowledge stirred me more than anything as I followed him down
the little path to the packed clearing, he was an American. I
should have been jealous if Red Templeton had been selected. It may
seem petty of me to make such an assertion, but although I had a
fear that the Spotted Panther would prove too much for Morgan,
still I was glad that the prestige of the white race was to be
upheld by one who came from my own land.</p>

<p>"We must get some food," said Red. "You cannot fight in the
condition you are in. Let me make a postponement, Morgan. You've
had no rest and no food."</p>

<p>Chico shook his head. "Ill never be in better mood to fight than
I am now," he said. "I couldn't eat any food just now. I want to
moisten my lips, that's all."</p>

<p>The Panther had shouted to the crowd as we walked down the stony
slope, and as we stepped on to the clearing the mob opened to
receive us. We had no thought of treachery. From the looks of
wide-eyed fear which the crowd bestowed upon us, we knew that the
words of the hag had made a great impression, and although they
were willing to watch the impending battle, their anxiety was for
the Panther, who they were convinced was going to fight a spirit
that had entered the cave of the sword while the big stone slab was
still in place. A score or more were so impressed with the danger
their chief was running that they made shrill protestations, which
the Panther stopped with a deep-throated order.</p>

<p>As we came close to the big savage my fears for Chico became
greater. The Dyak was a mighty man. Never had I seen a man of such
muscular build. He was a brown Hercules, a Hercules with all the
spring and elasticity of the wild man in his limbs. Chico seemed
slow and muscle-bound compared with him. The savage had never worn
shoes, and as I watched his feet as he moved across the grass I
thought sadly over the effect which a prolonged fight upon the
springy turf would have upon Morgan.</p>

<p>"He's a devil!" I muttered to Templeton.</p>

<p>Red looked carefully from Chico to the brown man and then tucked
his lips in as if the conclusions troubled him. "He's a fine
brute," he said quietly. "The most magnificent specimen of a man I
have ever seen."</p>

<p>I fingered the revolver which I had received back from
Templeton, and I think the desire to shoot the big brown man shone
in my eyes at that moment. I felt that I would be committing a
murder to stop the Panther committing one, but the big Englishman
guessed my intentions.</p>

<p>"If you use a gun I will kill you with my own hands, Lenford,"
he said slowly. "Morgan will beat him, I tell you. He has tradition
and pride of race behind him, and besides&mdash;besides, you
simpleton, he is fighting for the Sword."</p>

<p>The big lieutenant of the Panther had beaten back the crowd till
there was a clear circle in the middle of the clearing. The
lieutenant seemed to be the only one who exhibited the confidence
of his chief, and his broad grin annoyed Templeton while Chico was
preparing for the fray. The Panther had no preparations to make. He
was naked except for the loin cloth and the mask that covered his
face.</p>

<p>Morgan took off his shoes and rolled up the legs of the soiled
khaki trousers. His shirt had been torn to shreds in the passage
between the big cavern and the little scooped-out burrow on the
cliff. I redressed the stump of the finger, Templeton protesting
angrily that the injury would handicap Morgan, and asserting that
the Panther's choice might have been influenced by the bloody
bandage.</p>

<p>"Let me fight him!" cried Red. "Let me explain that your hand is
injured."</p>

<p>Chico smiled the old confident smile as he brushed the fair hair
back from his forehead. "Don't worry, Templeton," he said. "I'll be
going strong at the finish. If he's ready to start the skirmish,
I'm his man."</p>

<p>We shall be a poor race when we cannot fight. Courage is one of
the greatest virtues, and no man born had greater courage than
Chico Morgan. I thrilled from head to toe as he stepped forward,
and I know that Red Templeton felt a joy in the knowledge that he
had picked no craven as a mate on that night in Banjermassin. We
knew that the battle was to be one to the death. If Chico could not
finish the Panther, the old woman's assertion that we were the
spirits spoken of in the prophecy would be thrown aside, and the
heads of Morgan, Templeton, and myself would probably adorn the
walls of the chief's house in the <i>kampong</i>.</p>

<p>"For the white race and America," muttered Red. "Keep cool, boy.
You'll beat him every inch of the way."</p>

<p>That Dyak was well named when they called him the Spotted
Panther. As Chico Morgan advanced to the centre of the cleared
space, the savage gave a low whine, and sprang. It was a wonderful
spring! He shot through the air like a thunderbolt, but Chico
wasn't the one to wait for a human cannon ball to knock the wind
out of him. He sidestepped neatly, and as the brown man whizzed by,
Morgan planted a right on the side of his head that must have
jarred every nerve in his gigantic frame. It was a beautiful punch.
The Panther went forward on his hands and knees, but he bounded to
his feet as if made of india rubber and he flung himself with
marvellous suddenness upon the white man. Chico couldn't evade that
leap. He thought to stop the rush by landing right and left body
blows as the Panther rushed, but the blows seemed to have no effect
upon the savage. He broke through Morgan's guard, and his huge arms
went around Chico's chest like the feelers of an octopus.</p>

<p>I am sure that those savages had never seen a fight like that.
In all that wild stretch of jungle there was no man as strong as
the Spotted Panther, and I am willing to wager that no man, white,
brown, or black, possessed the courage that was Morgan's. Fear was
an unknown quantity to that big American. He had implicit
confidence in himself, a confidence that had been bred by the
muscles' of steel that had brought him victorious out of a thousand
tight corners in different parts of the world.</p>

<p>The great Dyak shifted his grip, and his big hands groped for
Chico's throat. And there was death in those hands. The fingers of
steel fascinated Templeton and me as we stood and watched with
bulging eyes. Again and again Morgan broke the grip that the other
put upon him, but the savage was unrelenting. His fingers were
hungry for the throat of the white man. They worked toward it
stealthily and quietly, and the smashing blows which Chico rained
upon him could not turn him from the desire to accomplish the trick
which was uppermost in his mind.</p>

<p>"Tear off his mask!" cried Templeton. "Tear it off and you'll
see where his jaw is!"</p>

<p>Chico broke from the gorilla-like hug of the Panther,
sidestepped a mad rush, and clawed the bark-cloth mask from the
face of the Dyak as he slipped out of his path. Templeton gave a
cry of horror which I echoed. We had no idea as to what Chico would
expose when he tore away the mask. We thought that the big fiend
had worn the covering to add a touch of mystery to his person, but
when Morgan acted upon Templeton's advice we knew differently. By
the Beard of Mahomet! Yes! The face that the Panther turned upon
Chico was the face of a silver leper, and if ever the face of a
devil was seen upon earth it was the one we saw then!</p>

<p>We knew that his people had never seen the marks of the disease.
The whimper of astonishment that came from the lips of the packed
hundreds told us that they were as much astonished as we were. We
were certain that they had never looked upon that face of horror.
They moaned and whimpered in fear and wonder, the women turning
away from the fiendish, disease-marked face that was confronting
Morgan.</p>

<p>Curiously, the terrible markings had not extended to the neck
and body. Not a single spot showed upon the muscular column that
supported the head, and we stared at the freak in amazement. It was
the strangest manifestation of the disease that we had ever
seen.</p>

<p>Chico reeled back when he caught the first glance of the
terrible face he had uncovered. For a moment I bad a feeling that
the horror before him would make him turn and run, but I was
measuring Morgan's courage with my own bushel. Satan himself
couldn't make Chico run. That fear-inspiring face gave him a
momentary qualm, but when the Panther rushed upon him with a howl
of fury Morgan was there to receive him.</p>

<p>"Hit him again, Morgan!" cried Templeton. "Again! Again!"</p>

<p>With magnificent skill Chico planted his two fists on the
silvered face, and the force with which those two blows went home
told us the brand of courage that Morgan was carrying. We knew
there was no yellow streak in his make-up. When his fists landed
solidly upon the Panther's face I felt sick at the | mere thought
of physical contact with the disease-ravaged features, but if we
could judge by the force which Morgan put behind those punches we
were certain that he was not afraid to hit. And Chico had only a
few seconds to steel his nerves to the sight of that face. The
suddenness with which the spectacle had been brought before him was
enough to upset the balance of any ordinary man, but Morgan was not
an ordinary man. He was a fighting machine of wonderful thews and
courage, and the big Dyak found that out before that fight was
over.</p>

<p>The Panther, although insane with passion at finding that his
mask had been torn away, realized what a shock the sight of his
face would be to Morgan and he rushed in to take advantage of
Chico's astonishment.</p>

<p>"Look out!" roared Templeton. "Smash him, Chico! That's the way!
Mind his grip, boy! Keep clear of him!"</p>

<p>Chico Morgan was a wonderful fighter. When that untamed gorilla
came flying through the air in an endeavour to get a grip upon the
white man, Chico would dodge and duck in a manner that surprised
us. When the Panther's long arms went out like the muscular limbs
of the <i>simia wurmbii</i>, or giant orang-utan, Chico would slip
away from them like a light-toed dancing master, planting his fists
upon the face of the savage as he floundered after him. That
silvered face, that was so distorted that it resembled the face of
a Malayan devil, could not frighten the American. He never funked
the onslaught. Left and right jabs, swings, and uppercuts crashed
upon the Dyak's face, and Templeton and I roared applause till the
jungle echoed. The big Englishman was nearly crazy with excitement
as he hopped around the ring and encouraged Chico to greater
efforts.</p>

<p>"Now you've got him!" he roared, as the Panther staggered
beneath a tornado of blows that Morgan delivered. "In the eyes,
comrade! Blind him and you can do what you like with him!"</p>

<p>And Chico was blinding the Panther effectively. The Dyak was
discovering that the American was as slippery as an eel, and
Chico's blows were fast closing the little black eyes that
resembled marbles of jade in that peculiar silvered face. And the
big savage understood that victory was slipping away from him at
that moment. He was becoming tired, and the terrific punching that
Chico had administered was beginning to tell.</p>

<p>"Don't let up on him!" yelled Templeton. "Swing in the right!
The right!"</p>

<p>Morgan measured the giant as he made another blind rush, the
white man's big fist landed squarely on the brown man's chin, and
the Spotted Panther dropped upon the grass.</p>

<p>Red opened his mouth to give a cry of triumph, but the cry was
choked back. The big lieutenant of the Dyak chief had sprung toward
Chico with an uplifted kris in his right hand, and Templeton acted
with a swiftness that was extraordinary. The Great Parang of Buddha
flashed in the sunlight, it fell like a flame upon the murderous
savage, and the lieutenant dropped upon his knees, his head split
from crown to chin.</p>

<p>It was at that moment I noticed Nao for the first time since the
start of the battle. She worked her way through the crowd that
seemed to be stricken dumb by the happenings, and clasping
Templeton by the arm, she spoke to him rapidly.</p>

<p>"She's right!" cried Red. "Don't let him up, Morgan! Kill
him!"</p>

<p>Chico wiped the perspiration from his face as he stood with legs
apart waiting for the big savage to get upon his feet.</p>

<p>"Kill him!" I screamed. "There are no rules! Kill him!"</p>

<p>Morgan smiled faintly as he heard our shouts, but he made no
move toward the fallen Panther. There were no rules to that battle,
but Chico could not bring himself to strike an antagonist on the
ground. With the eyes of the mob upon him he stood with legs apart,
swaying slowly backward and forward, ready to carry on the fight
when the big Dyak got to his feet.</p>

<p>The Panther rose slowly. For quite two minutes he crouched upon
his hams, then he hurled himself upon Chico. The impact knocked
Morgan to the ground, and as the crowd surged in upon the cleared
space, the two fought and writhed upon the grass, each trying for a
grip upon the throat of the other. Red swung the Great Sword to
clear a circle, and the wild-eyed mob sprang back from its touch.
To them it was a sacred thing that must not be brought into contact
with common clay.</p>

<p>The two on the ground thrashed about like a pair of huge
pythons. Over and over they rolled, the fingers of each groping
blindly for a throat grip, and in a silence that was more terrible
than the noise made by the bull-roarer, we stood and watched
them.</p>

<p>Slowly the Panther wormed himself uppermost, and the fingers of
steel foraged for Chico's throat. Red Templeton cursed softly as he
leaned forward. In the strained faces of the Dyaks we saw the
effect of the advantage which their chief had gained. They knew the
strength that lay in those fingers and as they closed upon Chico's
neck a sigh of wonder and relief went up from the crowd.</p>

<p>Templeton, his big jaw thrust out, his eyes blazing, hung above
the two, while the fingers of the Panther slowly throttled the life
out of Morgan.</p>

<p>"Chico!" shrieked Red. "Give him the knee! The knee, man! Look!
Here's the sword!"</p>

<p>I believe it was the sight of the Great Parang that worked the
miracle. I'm sure it was. Red thrust the handle of the weapon
toward Chico, and it seemed to fire him. We knew by the flash in
his eyes that he was going to make a supreme effort. Slowly, very
slowly, he worked his knees up beneath the stomach of the Panther,
then with a convulsive thrust forward, he broke the death grip,
rolled completely over and drove his fingers deep into the throat
of the leprous giant!</p>

<p>"Hold him, you bulldog!" roared Templeton. "Stick to him! Don't
let up on him!"</p>

<p>The fight was over then. The muscles of the Panther relaxed, his
mouth opened, and his mighty chest collapsed. Chico unloosed his
grip, got upon his hands and knees, lifted himself wearily to his
feet, then reeled forward into the arms of Templeton and the Golden
One.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17" name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The Prophetess</p>

<p class="first"><br>
IT seemed to us that the inferno was unloosed following the defeat
of the Panther. Whether the hag's sermon regarding our identity
made the crowd crazy to touch us, or whether the defeat of the
chief made them anxious to lay their hands upon the man who had
defeated him, we could not tell, but the packed mass upon the
clearing swarmed in upon us, their hands outstretched, their mouths
open as they made a peculiar noise that was not unlike the sound
they produced when the Great Sword was paraded on the night of the
Bloody Moon.</p>

<p>"They'll smother Morgan!" I cried. "Keep them back and give him
air!"</p>

<p>Templeton lowered Chico to the ground, seized the Great Parang
and struck with the flat of the blade at the clawing forms that
swept in upon us. The hag, who was older than the ruins of Pnom
Preen, had climbed upon the shoulders of the massed savages, and
her thin voice could be heard above the cries of all the others. It
was her hour of triumph.</p>

<p>She had told the Panther that we were spirits, and now that
Chico had defeated the brown chief she was thrusting herself in the
spotlight with all the power at her command.</p>

<p>The mob fell back before the sword, and Nao spoke rapidly to
Red.</p>

<p>"Where will we take him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nao thinks the cave is the best," said Templeton. "It is safer
in case of trouble. Besides, it's considered the abode of spirits,
so we'll be let alone."</p>

<p>"How will we get him there?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Hold the sword!" cried Templeton. "Hit them back, Lenford! Hit
them back!"</p>

<p>I could barely lift the weapon with the strength of my two
hands, but the mere movement of the blade made the terrified
savages fall back. Templeton stooped down, put his tremendous arms
around the unconscious Chico, and lifted him to his shoulders.</p>

<p>"To the cave, Lenford!" he roared. "Knock them back! Swing it,
man! Swing it!"</p>

<p>I look back and wonder at that day. The place was an inferno.
That old Jezebel ran along upon the shoulders of the mob, and she
screamed orders at us that made my blood run cold, although I could
hardly understand a word that she was saying.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with her?" cried Templeton.</p>

<p>"Ask Nao!" I roared.</p>

<p>Red, striding forward with as much unconcern as if Chico were a
baby, put the question to the Golden One and then translated her
answer.</p>

<p>"She wants us to go and work the magic of closing up the Mouths
of Boorsh," he explained. "A human sacrifice is necessary, and
they've got some one for the job."</p>

<p>"I hope Chico is well enough to bolt with us tonight," I said.
"Another twenty-four hours in this place will send me insane."</p>

<p>We reached the opening of the little cave, and Templeton lowered
Chico and carried him inside. Nao had managed to secure a bamboo
notch full of cold water, and while I swung the sword to keep the
horde from the ledge in front of the refuge, Templeton and the
Golden One bathed Morgan's face with the cold water.</p>

<p>"He's coming round!" shouted Red. "Keep them back! He'll be
right in a few minutes!"</p>

<p>I stooped for a moment to get confirmation of the good news, and
as I peered into the place, Chico's lids flickered and he looked
up. For a moment he stared at us stupidly, as if the recollection
of the fight had been swept from his mind, then a look of horror
flashed into his blue eyes and he made an effort to speak.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Templeton.</p>

<p>"Is he&mdash;is he dead?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"I think so," answered Red.</p>

<p>"Make sure," gurgled Chico. "Make sure! Kill him! He's the fiend
himself!"</p>

<p>It was curious how we overlooked the Panther in the mad wind-up
of that battle royal. The condition of Chico, and the stampede of
the crowd, had thrust him momentarily from our mind, and it was
only Morgan's imploring cry that made us recognize our ignorance
regarding the outcome.</p>

<p>Templeton looked up at me when he saw the fear in Chico's eyes.
"Run back, Lenford! Drive the Big Sword into him! Here let me
go!"</p>

<p>Red seized the sword, and swinging it above his head, charged
madly down the slope. The hag was still calling upon us to come and
perform our mission of closing the Mouths of Boorsh, while the mob
was helping her out in a refrain which she put at the end of her
shrill appeals. The clearing was a sea of brown faces all turned
toward the opening of the cave.</p>

<p>Templeton reached the spot where the battle had taken place,
turned and sprang back up the rocky slope.</p>

<p>"They've carried him away!" he cried. "Keep a sharp lookout! If
he is alive we'll have trouble by the bucketful!"</p>

<p>Chico groaned when Templeton gave him the news, and the light of
terror flashed again into his eyes. The battle with the primitive
brute had unnerved him, and he watched the opening of the cave as
if he expected the Panther to leap in upon us.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about him!" cried Templeton. "If he's alive he
won't be able to get about for a day or two. But I don't think he
is alive. You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is alive," interrupted Chico. "I feel that he's alive,
Templeton! And he can recover from that fight in one tenth the time
you or I would take. Watch for him! Watch for him!"</p>

<p>"We'll watch," said Red. "Keep quiet and rest yourself."</p>

<p>Nao brought a preparation made from crocodile fat and extract of
gum leaves and we rubbed this over Morgan's body. The marks of the
Panther's claws were everywhere. If the big fiend lacked the
science to make his punches effective he did not lack the strength
to leave his finger-marks where he took a grip. Chico had the
appearance of a man who had been mauled by a bear, and Templeton
cursed softly as he rubbed in the liniment.</p>

<p>"He's a gorilla," he growled. "We were mad to accept his
offer."</p>

<p>"He's a devil," muttered Chico. "Keep a watch for him, Lenford.
If you see him coming, get me on my feet and give me a gun. Put
that revolver here within reach."</p>

<p>We placed Morgan upon a bed of leaves that a few young Dyaks had
gathered by Nao's orders, and the girl sat down beside him and fed
him with rice water. The Golden One had evidently thrown her lot in
with ours since the fight, and she tried to do all she could for
the battered Chico. Outside on the clearing the mob was still
howling, while the ancient hag was imploring us with extended arms
to fulfill the prophecy regarding the Mouths of Boorsh.</p>

<p>"Holy St. Michael! what will be the end of it all?" gasped
Templeton. "Have they all gone crazy?"</p>

<p>Red lifted up the Great Sword, thinking it might silence them,
but the action only increased the uproar. The hag had worked them
up to an insane pitch with her talk about the prophecy, and nothing
would silence them. They were firmly convinced that we were not
ordinary mortals. No man in their recollection had ever fought the
Spotted Panther single-handed and remained alive to tell the story,
so Chico's achievement had stamped the prophecy of the old crone
with the hallmark of truth.</p>

<p>The Golden One, wild-eyed and nervous, came out of the cave, and
Templeton asked her to translate the words of the whining hag. The
girl did so, and Red turned her words into English for my benefit.
I think the real poison of that place began to seep into our bodies
just then. I know that I was more afraid as I listened to the words
of the, ancient hag then I had ever been before. The surroundings
were destroying the bonds that bound us to civilization. We had a
fear that something inside our heads would give way, and that we
would go down and howl with the mob. The hands of the jungle were
reaching out for us. The smells of the jungle were diving into our
brains and dragging out the desires of dead ancestors who fought
with the dinosaur and the glyptodon, and the skin of our necks
prickled with the fear of the unseen.</p>

<p>"This is what she says," cried Templeton. "Come and close the
mouths that are ever hungry! The mouths that wait for food! The
mouths that cry in the nights when nothing comes to them. Close
them! We hear them in the darkness crying for our men and women.
Their lips move as we pass by. They reach out and swallow our brave
ones. Close them! Close them! The sacrifice is ready, why do you
wait?"</p>

<p>That old hag must have cried that out in a tongue that our
ancestors used ten thousand years before. I'm sure she must have.
As Red translated it to me I seemed to grope into my mind and dig
out the very words she was using. We were in a backwater of the
world where nothing moved, and where the tongues of ten thousand
generations had cried aloud the supplication made by the hag with
the eyes that belonged to the Stone Age.</p>

<p>"What are we to do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Sit down and wait," answered Templeton. "I'd be a darn big
failure if I tried to turn a morass into solid land. That's a job
that is outside my line of business."</p>

<p>"Can't we do something to quiet them?"</p>

<p>"Nothing will quiet them," snapped Templeton. "That old witch
has driven them insane."</p>

<p>The hag turned her back upon us and screamed to the crowd, and a
score of men immediately detached themselves from the packed mass
and disappeared in the strip of thick undergrowth that separated
the clearing from the <i>kampong</i>.</p>

<p>"Ask the Golden One the meaning of it!" I cried. "Where have
they gone?"</p>

<p>Templeton put the question, and turned to me with a grim smile
upon his face. "We'll have to work up an excuse of some sort," he
said. "She has sent them to bring the sacrifice out for our
inspection. Nao thinks that there is danger in their present
attitude unless we can do something to cool them off."</p>

<p>"We might object to the sacrifice." I muttered.</p>

<p>"We could say that he was too fat or too thin according to how
he looked. If we got three or four days' grace to fatten him or
thin him down it would give Chico a chance to get in travelling
form."</p>

<p>"You've struck the right idea," said Templeton. "We must find
fault with him. I guess it's one of the Tring tribe that they have
captured, so it's a certainty that he is thin."</p>

<p>The bull-roarer started to throb in the village, and we
understood from the shouts of the crowd that the sacrifice was
being brought toward the clearing.</p>

<p>Templeton thrust his head in the opening of the cave as Chico
cried out a question regarding the ruction.</p>

<p>"It's the sacrifice that you will have to offer to the Mouths of
Boorsh," explained Templeton. "They are bringing him over for our
inspection. Lenford and I are going to protest against his size,
and that will give you time to get well."</p>

<p>The racket came closer, the guard crashed through the
undergrowth, fought their way through the crowd, halted at the foot
of the slope, and pushed their captive forward. Templeton and I
gave a joint cry of astonishment. Standing in front of us, a
picture of grief and misery, was Gung, the Hindu!</p>

<p>The unfortunate wretch blinked stupidly as if doubtful whether
we were real or part of the nightmare which surrounded him, but
when he saw the Great Parang in Templeton's hands, a flash of hope
spread across his lean features.</p>

<p>"Sahib!" he shrieked. "Save me, sahib! Save me!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18" name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The Call Of The Orang Capello</p>

<p class="first"><br>
WE were never more impressed with the tremendous happenings of the
preceding sixty hours than when we looked upon the mud-spattered
Hindu. It took an effort to recall the stampede at the Place of
Evil Winds and the manner in which Gung had left us. Into the time
that intervened between our first meeting with the White
<i>Mias</i> and the appearance of the sacrifice we had crammed so
much adventure that we looked back on that night as if it was in a
remote past.</p>

<p>Templeton walked down the slope, took his knife from its sheath
and cut the rattan bonds that bound the Hindu. The hag saw in the
action an intimation that we were willing to take immediate action
in the matter of the ceremony, and she screamed her anticipations
to the crowd. Waving her skinny arms she yelled her belief till the
jungle echoed with her screams and the yells of joy with which her
words were greeted.</p>

<p>Chico cried out a question and I answered him.</p>

<p>"Gung has come back," I said. "They caught him in the jungle.
You are supposed to sacrifice him to the Mouths of Boorsh as a
final offering before you close them up."</p>

<p>"They can go to the devil!" he growled. "If I can walk I'm going
to quit this camp the moment it is dark."</p>

<p>Templeton put his hand upon Gung's shoulder and pushed him up
the slope to the spot where Nao and I were standing. The Hindu was
shivering with terror. His thin, spider-like legs wobbled fearfully
as Red pushed him up the slight incline.</p>

<p>"Save me, sahib!" he muttered. "Take me from them!"</p>

<p>"We'll try to," said Red. "We want somebody to come along and
get us away from them."</p>

<p>Templeton explained to Nao that he wished her to inform the hag
and the howling mob that Gung, although eminently fitted for a
sacrifice, was at the moment too thin for the position, and that
three or four days of good feeding would be necessary to make him
acceptable to the gurgling mouths of the morass. The Golden One
delivered the message and nearly created a riot in so doing. The
screaming hag wanted immediate action, and her wild cries so
excited the crowd that fifty warriors charged up the slope.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot!" cried Templeton. "The sword creates a much bigger
sensation. See what effect I can produce by winging this lanky
savage in the lead."</p>

<p>"But the blowpipes!" I cried. "Look out! The man in the lead is
going to send a dart at us."</p>

<p>The tall, thin runner leading the mob lifted his
<i>sampitan</i>, but he wasn't quick enough. A revolver bullet
struck him in the chest, he rolled down the slope, and the crowd
came to a sudden stop. Vainly the hag implored them to rush up the
incline and compel us to make an immediate sacrifice of Gung, but
the natives were cautious. They were anxious that the Mouths of
Boorsh should be closed forever, but they were in no hurry to lose
their lives in forcing us to perform the miracle. While she
screamed they retreated sullenly, and Gung stiffened his thin legs
in an endeavour to appear courageous.</p>

<p>"They will kill us!" he cried. "They have made up their minds to
kill us, sahib!"</p>

<p>"We've got something to say in that matter," said Templeton
grimly. "Keep your nerve up, Gung; They're not as bad as the White
<i>Mias</i>."</p>

<p>A tremor passed over the Hindu's frame, and his face muscles
worked convulsively. The fear that had gripped him the night that
the orang-utans had stampeded him and the ten Dyaks had not been
worked out of his system by the succeeding dangers through which he
had passed.</p>

<p>The revolver shot had brought the battered Chico from his bed of
leaves, and he peered through the opening of the cave at the
throng.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They're in a hurry to get us busy," answered Templeton. "I've
explained that Gung isn't fat enough to offer up to-day, but
they're insistent."</p>

<p>Chico laid himself down with his head through the opening, and
the mob, catching sight of his face, whined in chorus. The hag
stopped her screaming and retired to the shadow of a big tapang
tree. The midday heat was oppressive, and the peculiar nasal whine
had a somnolent effect upon us as we sat and watched the hundreds
who squatted upon their haunches and stared up at us.</p>

<p>The odours of the jungle and the morass crept up around us and
increased our desire for sleep. Body o' me! weren't we sleepy! For
the two preceding nights we had little or no rest, and that
singsong noise, together with the stupor produced by the heat and
the odours, made us long to shut our eyes and sleep for a year.</p>

<p>Twice I rolled over against the rocky wall of the cavern, but
the watchful Templeton shook me gently and made me open my
eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't go to sleep," he growled. "If we shut our eyes it will be
our last sleep."</p>

<p>I suppose there was some hypnotic power in the stare of those
hundreds. There must have been. They might have willed us to sleep,
and helped out their mental suggestion with that nasal whine that
made it impossible for any one to keep his eyes open. I'm sure they
did. I felt that their nasal chant was killing my power of thought,
and as I stared at them I imagined that the squatting hundreds were
kin to the great silent trees of tapang, mohor, and kaladang. I had
a feeling that everything around us was alive&mdash;the trees, the
morass, the mudbanks&mdash;and that we were the enemies of
everything within sight because we had put a veneer of civilization
upon ourselves that made it impossible for us to understand the
jungle and the things that were of the jungle.</p>

<p>It was a punch from Templeton that dragged me out of the land of
dreams, and I sprang up in alarm. The squatting hundreds were still
in their places, but now their faces were turned away from us. A
noise in the jungle had attracted their attention, and the noise
was one that made us wonder concerning its meaning. It was the
noise of the bull-roarer, not the continuous noise that we had
heard on previous occasions, but short, intermittent throbbings
that charged the hot afternoon with a feeling of sinister
dread.</p>

<p>For a full five minutes the squatting hundreds remained
inactive, their faces turned to the spot from which the noise came,
then in groups of five and ten they stood up and slipped quietly
into the undergrowth.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>Red turned to the Golden One, whose turquoise-bordered
<i>kabayah</i> that rose and fell with her quick breathing seemed
to tell us that something unusual was afoot. The girl's big eyes
watched the disappearing men, then she turned toward us and
whispered a few words in Portuguese.</p>

<p>"She says it is the Panther," said Templeton. "That is the call
of the <i>orang capello</i>, or head man, and no one can use it
except the chief or his successor. And there is no successor
elected."</p>

<p>One after the other the groups stole from the clearing, and we
sat and watched them. The sound of the roarer awakened Chico from
the doze he had fallen into and he dragged himself upon the ledge
and listened. Templeton gave him Nao's explanation of the racket,
and Morgan's fingers tightened upon the butt of his revolver.</p>

<p>"I knew he wasn't dead," he said quietly. "I hadn't the strength
in my fingers to finish him. I don't think any one could finish
him."</p>

<p>"We'll try him with lead next time," snapped Templeton. "We
should have used it on the beggar this morning."</p>

<p>The mob dwindled down till but half a score remained. These
squatted in the clearing till another and louder signal came from
the tree masses, then they stood up and slipped away, leaving only
the ancient hag to watch us.</p>

<p>"She's afraid to go, I think," said Templeton. "She denounced
the Panther because he wouldn't believe that we were spirits."</p>

<p>"Let Nao speak to her," said Chico. "Ask her who she is?"</p>

<p>Red asked the girl and she answered quickly.</p>

<p>"She says that the old one is the Mother of the Years,"
translated Templeton. "She is older than the banyan clump in front
of the <i>kampong</i>."</p>

<p>"Get her views on our position," urged Chico. "We can't be any
worse off than we are."</p>

<p>The Golden One, at Templeton's suggestion, lifted her voice and
spoke to the hag. She spoke to her gently, and the old woman came
slowly forward, beating her bare and withered breasts with the
palms of her hands. That crone made us feel as old as the Green
Buddha of Yamada as she came toward us.</p>

<p>She exuded an atmosphere of age. When she stopped at the foot of
the slope we seemed to slip into the past and see things that we
had no knowledge of till that minute.</p>

<p>Nao spoke to Templeton, and Red lifted the Great Parang of
Buddha.</p>

<p>"She wants to see the sword," he said. "She asked Nao if she
could come closer to it."</p>

<p>"Sure she can," cried Chico. "Don't give it into her hands
though. I bet she can run faster than a jackrabbit, and we'd look
foolish chasing her through the trees if she took a notion to flit
with it."</p>

<p>Red smiled as he asked the Golden One to tell the ancient dame
to come forward. "She hasn't a possible chance of getting away with
it," he said. "We're going to take it to Benares if a thousand
Panthers and a thousand hags try to block the way."</p>

<p>The old woman approached with her withered hands upon her bare
head, her black eyes fixed upon the big blade. Up the slope she
came slowly, fell upon her knees when within a yard of Templeton,
and timidly put out a hand to touch the golden cobra that formed
the hilt. Her lips moved rapidly, but we could not catch the
words.</p>

<p>Very slowly the thin claw moved to the great blade and when her
fingers touched the first letters of the verse that was written in
Hindustanee, she looked questioning at Red.</p>

<p>"She looks as if she wants you to read it," said Chico. "Perhaps
it has been a puzzle to them."</p>

<p>The hag spoke to Nao, and the Golden One translated her
remarks.</p>

<p>"That is what she wants to know," said Templeton. "Nao says that
she knows what is written there, but that she wants to see if we
know."</p>

<p>"Try her out," cried Chico. "Repeat the first two lines to the
Golden One, and ask Mrs. Methuselah to give you the next two."</p>

<p>Red repeated the first two lines of the verse reading: "I, who
have parted the planets," and when Nao started to translate them to
the ancient hag we noticed the surprise which flashed over the face
of the crone. Her old body seemed to quiver with the shock she
received, and her little eyes flashed like bits of black opal.</p>

<p>"She knows it!" cried Chico. "Ask her for the next two
lines."</p>

<p>The Golden One put the question and that old beldame threw up
her head and started to chant. We knew that she was chanting that
poem before Nao translated a word to us. And it was wonderful how
we did know. Like her words about the Mouths of Boorsh, we seemed
to get the translation from the subconscious brain, and when she
got to the last line we joined in and shouted in English, "With
Faith I can build them at will," while she gave the rendering in
Malay.</p>

<p>"That's mighty wonderful," remarked Templeton. "They have no
records. This has been handed down for years. It might have been
told to them by some Buddhist priest that Enrique de Gama kidnapped
when he thieved the treasure."</p>

<p>Chico took a full breath and looked at the jungle. The afternoon
sun was slipping behind the trees, and a loneliness that wrenched
at our souls closed in upon the place. The bull-roarer had long ago
ceased to disturb the stillness, and as we alternately watched the
hag and the jungle, we longed for the atmosphere of civilization
and the feeling of security that comes with law and order.</p>

<p>"I'd give a little sum to be walking up Broadway right now,"
growled Chico. "While I was dreaming just now I thought I was
sitting out a show at the Hippodrome with a vision of a late supper
in the distance. What is her ladyship going to do?"</p>

<p>The hag slipped down the slope and made a wild rush for the
clearing. Her thin legs moved in a way that made us think of
Morgan's remark of a few minutes before as we watched her
sprint.</p>

<p>"What's up with her?" asked Templeton.</p>

<p>Gung, who had sat like a man in a trance from the moment that
Red had cut the rattan bonds from his arms, thrust his head forward
and listened intently.</p>

<p>"They are coming back, sahib," he said quietly. "They are all
coming. She heard them and she ran to meet them."</p>

<p>Gung was right. His sharper ears had caught the sounds of the
returning Dyaks, and we made ready for action. If the Panther was
alive and able to get about, it was a certainty that we would not
be left unmolested for long, and as a running battle was out of the
question on account of the half crippled state of Chico, the cave
was the only spot where we could fight with any advantage.</p>

<p>"Make Nao get inside out of harm's way," said Morgan. "I've got
a notion that the Panther has worked out his plans at the
conference."</p>

<p>The mob burst from the undergrowth at the spot where the savages
had disappeared, and it was then we began to have some idea of the
activity of the ancient hag who knew the verse on the blade. She
was skipping along in front of the mob, shrieking loudly, her back
turned to us, her skinny arms outstretched as if she would arrest
their approach.</p>

<p>"She's trying to save us," said Chico.</p>

<p>"Sure," growled Red. "She's telling them that we know the verse
upon the Great Parang."</p>

<p>I guess Templeton was right about her efforts. It seemed as if
her screaming was done on our behalf, but it did little good at
that moment. The Dyaks thrust her out of the way, but still
shrieking and waving her skinny hands she rushed ahead of the
leaders, a veritable fountain of abuse and energy.</p>

<p>"They're coming for us this time," said Red. "Get inside the
cave, Gung. You might sit near that hole in the corner and drop a
rock on the head of any one who tries to climb up through it."</p>

<p>Chico, bruised and battered, groaned with the pain of his
injuries as he stretched himself in the shelter of a boulder and
rested the barrel of his Winchester rifle upon the rock.</p>

<p>"I'm too sick to run, so I've got to stand," he said grimly. "If
we had enough ammunition it wouldn't be Look! Look!"</p>

<p>We looked in time to see a white face glance for an instant from
the leafy trees at the far end of the clearing, but the face had
disappeared before Chico fired. We got a thrill of horror from that
glimpse. The leprous face of the Spotted Panther chilled us, and we
forgot for a moment the approaching mob.</p>

<p>"You missed him!" cried Red. "Look out! These beggars have
started with the blowpipes!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19" name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="chaphead">When Templeton Fought Alone</p>

<p class="first"><br>
THE memory of the poisoned dart that had nearly put Chico out of
all worldly trouble made us shoot to kill as the savages lifted
their blowpipes to blaze away at us. We were more afraid of their
using the blowpipes than we would have been if they were using
Winchesters. A respectable lead bullet kills a man in a gentlemanly
way, but the dart that can take a man's life by merely touching the
end of his finger creates cold chills for the person who is under
attack.</p>

<p>"Take the middle section, Lenford!" cried Templeton. "Chico will
work the right. Wait till they get to the bottom of the slope, and
for the love of heaven don't miss!"</p>

<p>The pace of the warriors increased to a run when they were near
our end of the clearing, and with <i>sumpitans</i> ready to
discharge the deadly darts at any part of our bodies not protected
by the boulders, they rushed at the slope. Templeton thrust his hat
upon the blade of the Great Sword and pushed it up over the
shelter, and as the leaders sent a volley of darts in its
direction, we opened fire.</p>

<p>"Give it to them!" roared Chico. "That's the style! Keep it up,
boys! Keep it up!"</p>

<p>Three warriors in the lead toppled over from the effects of our
first round, but three deaths were nothing to the mob that surged
behind. Those in the rear knew nothing of any fatalities in the
front, and they swept the leaders up the slope.</p>

<p>"Make it as hot as you can!" yelled Templeton. "Give it to
them!"</p>

<p>Our only hope lay in taking Templeton's advice, and as fast as
we could load we fired at the swarm scrambling up the slope. But
two revolvers and a rifle were nothing to a mob of savages who were
thirsting for our blood. The occasional death yell of one of their
number was lost in the uproar, and they poured up the rise like a
brown wave, the rays of the westering sun glinting upon their oiled
bodies.</p>

<p>Templeton cursed as the savages sprang forward. Our ammunition
would be exhausted in a few seconds and what would happen after
that we had no desire to contemplate. The natives had flung the
blowpipes away as they came to close quarters, and the razor-edged
parangs flashed in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Templeton fired his last cartridge, flung the revolver at the
face of the leader, then, springing to his feet, he seized the
Great Sword of Buddha and swung it around his head. The thing cut
through the air like chain lighting, cut through the neck of the
brute in the lead and maimed the man immediately behind him. Glory
to strength! A poet with a tongue like Homer should have been there
to see Red Templeton at that moment. I shall conjure up the picture
in the days when my blood runs cold, and I shall thrill like a boy
who reads for the first time the story of Leónidas the Spartan.
That blade was made for blood. It was thirsty for it. It leaped at
the faces of the screaming fiends as if it had the thirst of three
centuries upon it. No wonder that it pulled down kings and put in
their places strong armed adventurers who knew how to use it.
Roland's enchanted sword was dwarfed by that Parang of Buddha.
Chico and I got upon our knees and roared like madmen. We forgot
the darts from the blowpipes. We forgot all danger. We only knew
that a big, red-blooded white man was scaring the hearts out of a
thousand savages by the way he hacked and drove a blade that Rolf
the Ganger would have given a dukedom for.</p>

<p>A great fear clutched the Dyaks. Their little parangs fell from
their hands as Red rushed upon them. They broke before his attack.
With yells of terror they turned and fled down the slope, and
Templeton howled like the wizard dog upon Mount Sai as he chased
them. I cannot write it as I saw it! I cannot tell it now in a way
that will make the reader's blood glow as mine glows every time I
run before my mental eye the film that pictures Templeton standing
like a red-headed Viking and dealing death in all directions.</p>

<p>"By the bones of Stonewall Jackson! he'll chase them into the
jungle!" roared Chico. "Red! Red! Come back, you fool! Come back!
Templeton! Templeton! Catch him, Lenford! Catch him!"</p>

<p>I rushed down the slope calling at the top of my voice, and as I
reached the clearing, he heard me. He was crazed with victory just
then. His eyes had a light in them that one never sees in these
cold-blooded days when men kill each other at a range of half a
mile.</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at me as if I was a stranger, while the
howling Dyaks, thankful to get the opportunity to escape, fled
across the clearing. For a moment he regarded me in puzzled wonder,
then he laughed and looked at the dripping blade.</p>

<p>"That was a great fight, Lenford," he said. "The golden cobra
has had a drink at last."</p>

<p>I walked back with him up the slope, and Chico Morgan clawed
himself upright and gripped Red's hand without speaking. They were
two great men. By the Beard of Mahomet! yes! I wrote when
describing their first fight in Banjermassin that I was doubtful
which was the better fighter of the two, and I am still in doubt
now that I have described their great battles. Chico had put up a
wonderful single-handed fight with the Panther that morning, but I
hope I may dream of Red Templeton's sword work through all
eternity.</p>

<p>Gung, the Hindu, crawled out of the cave, and looked at Red with
eyes of astonishment. The Hindu had thought that his last hour had
arrived when the leaders of the mob were swarming over the boulders
behind which we were entrenched, and the defeat of the enemy was
nothing short of a miracle. He dropped upon his knees in front of
Templeton and bowed his head before the great red sword.</p>

<p>Nao, looking as if the fear for our safety had made her more
beautiful than ever, stepped out of the cave and looked admiringly
from Morgan to Templeton, and from Templeton back to Morgan. To see
the Panther defeated in the morning and to see the Panther's horde
put to flight in the afternoon were sights that made the Golden One
feel strangely proud of the alliance that she had formed at the
little stone cross in the jungle.</p>

<p>For the space of a minute she looked at the two giants as if
trying to think up something complimentary to their prowess, then
she stood up between the two and, placing a little hand upon the
bare shoulder of each, she lisped one word.</p>

<p>"Leesbon," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Ay, Lisbon!" cried Chico. "We'll start to-night, my girl! If I
can't walk, Gung must carry me. We'll start to-night! The whole
crew of us! We'll start for Broadway, Piccadilly, the Praco do
Rocia, and every other place that there are bright lights
shining!"</p>

<p>Templeton smiled at Chico's good humour, then he glanced at the
jungle, from which came cries and yells, with an occasional throb
of the concentrated essence of sound when the bull-roarer was let
loose. "We'll surely have to make an attempt to get away to-night,"
he said. "They'll get their nerve back in a few hours, and we can't
fight them at long range without ammunition. We had luck this time.
They were so thick around us that they hadn't room to use their
blowpipes."</p>

<p>"Sure we'll go to-night!" cried Chico. "I've an idea that
to-night is the night that Fate has picked out for our retreat. You
don't understand me, Nao, but it's a lump of wisdom I'm handing
out."</p>

<p>"Leesbon," murmured the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's Lisbon," cried the delighted Morgan. "We're off to
Philadelphia in the morning!"</p>

<p>Templeton was staring at the Great Sword that flashed back the
last rays of the setting sun. "We'll never part with it, Morgan,"
he said quietly.</p>

<p>"We never will," answered Chico. "We'll only show it to them in
that old Temple of Arungzebee. Show it to them at ten dollars a
head, but they'll never get possession of it. Not even if the
British Government wants to make you a rajah, Red!"</p>

<p>"No, nor a hundred times a rajah!" muttered Templeton. "A man
who owns this is greater than a king."</p>

<p>"If he can swing it like you can," said Chico. "Never mind, it
will be dark in a few minutes, and we'll be getting ready to give
them a lesson in the art of disappearing."</p>

<p>The sun slipped out of sight, and the wings of night came down
out of Asia and enfolded the clearing. The thick darkness washed
out the outlines of the big trees, and the noises of prowling
things came from the undergrowth.</p>

<p>"They're bound to have a strong guard at the crossing where we
met the One-Who-Never-Slept," muttered Chico.</p>

<p>"We'll have to chance it," said Red. "If you can walk we'll try
our luck."</p>

<p>"I'll crawl to get out of this place," growled Morgan. "I've had
enough of the jungle to last me for the rest of my life."</p>

<p>The Golden One was brought into the consultation, and Templeton
asked her advice on the best way of reaching the spot where the
swinging rope hung above the channel of bubbling mud. The moon
would rise within an hour, and although Nao asserted that we would
need the light to get to the swinging ropes and thence across the
Mouths of Boorsh, we decided that we would leave the cave under
cover of darkness. Our position upon the cliff gave us too much
prominence, and if we attempted to move out after the moon had
risen, our retreat would be noticed by the watchful eyes of the
Dyaks.</p>

<p>"We'll get down to the bottom of the cliff and wait there," said
Templeton. "Then we can go forward the moment we have sufficient
light."</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried Chico. "Lead the way with the sword, Red. We'll
follow after you."</p>

<p>Templeton picked up the Great Parang and moved down the narrow
path, and we fell into line behind him. It was the start home, and
I experienced a thousand thrills as we went forward. If we could
cross the Mouths of Boorsh in safety and reach the banks of the
Barito River, we would make Banjermassin inside three weeks, and my
heart pounded mightily as I thought of the stir we would cause in
the waiting Orient when the news of our discovery would go forth to
the world. The Cup of Everlasting Fire which the opium-dulled
Courtney had possessed himself of was nothing to that sword.
Nothing at all! The cup was beautiful, but the Great Parang was a
living Force! Yes! it was alive! If it had spoken to us like the
magic sword spoke to Roland we would not have been surprised.</p>

<p>The Golden One spoke to Templeton as we stepped down the narrow
path, and Morgan asked for a translation.</p>

<p>"What did she say?" asked Chico.</p>

<p>"She wants us to stop at the stone cross so that she can make a
farewell prayer there."</p>

<p>"Stop by all means," answered Morgan. "I'm not given much to
prayers, but if we get as far as the cross with our heads on our
shoulders I'll do some praying myself. And I'll make Gung pray too.
He's the sacrifice that missed being sacrificed."</p>

<p>The Hindu whispered a prayer to Buddha into the night air. Gung
was frightened clean out of his wits, and his teeth chattered as he
walked along. That place of mystery and death so affected him that
he was unable to answer a simple question.</p>

<p>Very slowly and very quietly we descended the cliff upon the
side nearest the <i>kampong</i>, following the path which Nao had
raced along when she acquainted us with the work of the man-hound
on that first morning of our arrival. We could not see an object
three feet in front of us, and Red reluctantly gave up his place in
the lead to the girl, who was surer-footed and familiar with the
locality.</p>

<p>We reached the level ground at last, and halted. The faintest
glow showed above the line of the jungle, and we crept into the
undergrowth to await the rising of the moon.</p>

<p>"Don't speak!" whispered Templeton. "You can't tell what the
beggars will be up to."</p>

<p>In silence we sat and waited, our ears noting the thousand and
one minor sounds that came from the jungle. The occasional cry of a
monkey and the hoot of an owl came to our ears, while now and then
we heard the squeal of a wild pig that had been trapped in one of
the bamboo pig traps which the cunning Kyan builds upon the path of
the porkers who raid his paddy patch.</p>

<p>I think it was the Golden One who first discovered a sinister
significance in the faint crackling of twigs and dry grasses that
came to our ears. Nao had remarkable hearing. She could hear sounds
that even Gung could not detect, and as we crouched in the darkness
she conveyed to us the intelligence that the enemy was moving upon
the cave.</p>

<p>We obtained the information through our own ears before many
minutes had passed. The night was alive! From the grassy clearing,
upon the fringe of which we sat and waited, came a rustling sound
that suggested the passage of a score of pythons moving slowly over
dry grass. The savages were crawling toward the slope!</p>

<p>Templeton put his face close to Nao's and suggested an immediate
move, but the Golden One had objections to offer. In a breathless
whisper she explained that many of the headhunters would approach
from the <i>kampong</i>, and that we would move directly across
their path if we made for the Mouths of Boorsh. Templeton
translated her objections in a whisper.</p>

<p>"We must wait till they climb the slope," he breathed. "Then we
must run."</p>

<p>We guessed we would have to run mighty hard as we sat and
listened to the advance of the Panther's warriors. The sinister
sound made by the bodies as they moved over the grass convinced us
that every man in the <i>kampong</i> had been gathered for the
attack, and as the faint glow from the rising moon spread like a
silvery mist over the place, we could dimly discern the sea of
moving bodies. And that army of attack gave us cold chills as we
crouched In the velvety shadows and watched it moving snakily
forward.</p>

<p>The light grew stronger, and it was then that we were convinced
that the Golden One was right in protesting against our plan of
moving straight upon the spot where the ropes swung over the
channel of mud. From the direction of the <i>kampong</i> a second
detachment was advancing to the attack, and as we listened to the
sounds that told of their approach, we understood that we were
directly between the two droves of crawling men. We would have to
remain perfectly quiet till the detachment from the village was
climbing the cliff, then, as Nao advised, slip quietly away.</p>

<p>"Glory be! we'll have to hustle some," breathed Chico. "When
they find that the nest is empty they'll fine-comb the jungle."</p>

<p>"Ssh! don't make a noise!" whispered Templeton. "Be ready now!
Give Morgan a hand, Lenford. Step lightly and move as fast as you
can."</p>

<p>We got upon our feet and waited for the word. At that moment we
could make out the figures of the foe quite distinctly. The ground
at the base of the cliff swarmed with them, but it was evident that
the dead bodies which bore testimony to the strength of Templeton's
right arm caused the attacking party to move very cautiously as
they approached the opening to the cave. As we stepped softly out
of the shadows the leading savages were moving at a snail's pace,
and we prayed fervently that an attack of funk would keep them from
making the final rush till we had reached the place of the swinging
ropes.</p>

<p>"Now," whispered Templeton, "follow me closely
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A cry broke from the mob upon the cliff&mdash;a cry of
concentrated terror, and we sprang back into the protecting
shadows.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Chico. "What are they saying?"</p>

<p>Nao pointed with her finger in the direction of the Mouths of
Boorsh, and we understood what had brought the wail of fear from
the mob. The rim of the moon appeared above the jungle, and the
moon was the color of blood!</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" cried Morgan. "The Moon of Blood! And the beggars
can't parade the Great Parang because they haven't got it!"</p>

<p>Their helplessness seemed to strike the head-hunters as they
stared at the alarming spectacle. The goddess of the night was
angry, and they had no way of appeasing her anger. From time
immemorial they had paraded the Great Sword around the clearing
when the red moon came up through the mists above the morass, but
now the sword was in the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>Curiously their fear of some terrible disaster overtaking them
while they were in the open made them forget their nearness to the
cave and the fact that their overwhelming numbers would make the
recovery of the weapon an easy matter. The only desire in their
primitive minds was to find a hiding-place from the angry eye of
the moon, and they set about that matter with vigour. Above the
groans of terror we heard the voice of the Panther ordering them
forward, but the Panther ordered in vain. Their leader was mortal,
but the red eye in the sky was something beyond their ken. They
rose to their feet in a body, and with bloodcurdling shrieks dashed
down the slope and into the jungle. Inside a minute the slope was
empty, and only a faint moaning from the silent tree masses told us
of the whereabouts of the terrified horde.</p>

<p>Chico gasped: "Did any one ever see the like of that? What are
we to do now? Half the brutes bolted in the direction of the
<i>kampong</i>!"</p>

<p>The Golden One started to sob, and Templeton tried to calm her.
The girl blamed herself for the delay that had increased our
dangers, and her grief was great.</p>

<p>"Tell her it wasn't her fault," said Chico. "We couldn't have
reached the ford if we had gone before. We're safer where we
are."</p>

<p>Templeton explained, and the girl dried her tears and joined in
the whispered discussion which we held as to the best move. It was
doubtful if the horde would return to the cliff after the moon had
fought its way out of the vapour clouds that gave it the peculiar
tinge, and we came to the conclusion that we would make an
immediate attempt to reach the crossing place in spite of the
dangers that were in our path.</p>

<p>"We can't go back!" said Chico. "We must go forward, and we
might as well start at once. Hello! here's one of them coming
back!"</p>

<p>Across the moonlit clearing raced a solitary figure, and we
watched it with interest. Up the slope to the cave it ran nimbly,
disappeared for an instant, then hopped through the opening, and
came hurriedly down the path toward the spot where we were
hiding.</p>

<p>"Now the game is up!" growled Red. "That inquisitive brute will
yell the news to the night, and they'll be on our path like a pack
of wolves."</p>

<p>The bold one came forward slowly, stopping every few paces and
peering around. Our thoughts went back to the human bloodhound
whose tracking work had been stopped by the poisoned dart that had
come from the jungle, and we wondered if the solitary wanderer was
another gifted with the same faculties.</p>

<p>The trailing native stopped within four feet of our
hiding-place, and we stared at the head that was thrust toward us.
We recognized those shrivelled features. The pursuer was the
hag&mdash;the ancient beldame that Nao had informed us was known as
the Mother of the Years!</p>

<p>She spoke softly, and the Golden One gave a little gasp that
told us that the penetrating eyes of the old woman had discovered
our hiding-place. It may not have been her eyes. That old withered
hag gave one the impression that nothing could be concealed from
her. She had followed our track down the hill like the cripple had
followed it the morning after our arrival.</p>

<p>"She sees us," said Chico. "You had better get Nao to speak to
her. She's friendly to us."</p>

<p>Templeton spoke to the Golden One, and the girl translated his
words to the Mother of the Years. Ay! she was Mother of the
Centuries as well as the Years! She was Time itself, wrapped in
parchment and defying natural laws by promenading around the
jungle.</p>

<p>The old woman stepped into the shadows and spoke rapidly to the
girl. We understood a word here and there, and we were mighty
anxious to hear the full translation from Red.</p>

<p>"What's the tale?" cried Morgan.</p>

<p>"The ropes are cut," answered Templeton. "There are two hundred
of the natives on guard at the spot where the One-Who-Never-Slept
met us, and there is no hope of us getting across by that
route."</p>

<p>"Ask her if there is any other way?" said Chico.</p>

<p>Templeton passed the query along, and the hag moved closer to us
before answering. She dropped upon her bony knees and fingered the
sword with her claws, then she lifted up her voice and spoke in a
dialect that Nao did not understand. I guess it was a dialect that
no one understood but herself.</p>

<p>"Who the dickens is she speaking to?" cried Red. "She is asking
questions of some one."</p>

<p>There was something about the woman's actions that upset Gung's
stomach. When she put her questions&mdash;we knew that they were
questions&mdash;the Hindu curled himself up like a whipped dog, and
his teeth chattered as he watched her. I guess Gung's skin was more
sensitive than ours, but our skins told us enough to make us creepy
at that moment. It disconcerts one a little to have an old woman
who looks as if she might have fought with a glyptodon put
questions to the empty atmosphere in a tongue that you have never
heard before.</p>

<p>"Me for civilization after this," muttered Chico. "These giddy
jungle-dwellers have got me feeling as foolish as a crocodile who
has swallowed a broken bottle."</p>

<p>Four times that ancient dame fired the question at the velvety
night, then she gave a gurgle of joy and turned quickly to the
Golden One. Words poured from her shrivelled lips, and we could
tell from the manner in which Nao clasped and unclasped her
tapering fingers that she was receiving news that was of more than
ordinary importance. We felt its importance before Nao translated a
word of it to Templeton.</p>

<p>"Out with it!" cried Morgan. "Tell us, Red!"</p>

<p>Templeton listened till the girl had translated the hag's
remarks, then he turned toward us. "Old Mother of the Years is
going to take us through a secret passage that is beneath the
channel of mud," he said. "It will bring us on to the island of
rock from which we swung across by the rope. No one knows of it,
not even the Panther. She calls it the Passage of the Living Light,
and she says it hasn't been used for half a century."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch20" name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The Passage Of The Glow-Worms</p>

<p class="first"><br>
I DO not know whether Templeton and Morgan were inclined to grip
that old hag's hand and shake it, but I know I had the inclination.
Yet it was an inclination that lacked the virility to convert
itself into an act. I was afraid to touch the thin claw of the
perambulating mummy, and I endeavoured to tender her my share of
the thanks by nodding vigorously when she looked in my
direction.</p>

<p>Gung was the only one who did not accept her proposition
gleefully. The Hindu was afraid of the old woman, and he groaned
fearfully as we stood up to follow her. Gung had become a confirmed
pessimist, and he refused to see a ray of comfort in the offer.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Gung," said Chico. "We've still got a chance. Buck
up, man! Buck up!"</p>

<p>The Mother of the Years started off in the direction of the
<i>kampong</i>, and we followed her at a swift pace. That old woman
was about the nimblest fossil we had ever seen. Judged by her face
you would say that she had as much life in her as the trilobites
they find in the Old Red Sandstone, but when she started to move
you decided differently.</p>

<p>She turned to the right before we came within a hundred yards of
the village, and moving swiftly through the thick undergrowth, we
circled the attap houses of the Panther's followers and came out
upon the edge of the Mouths of Boorsh at a point which we took to
be a quarter of a mile distant from the spot where we had gained
the shore on the night we crossed over. That place chilled us when
we came close to it. The horrid, rumbling noise suggestive of an
empty stomach of mammoth proportions came from it, and the eddying
mud that quivered in the bright moonlight gave us creepy sensations
that are indescribable. We didn't wonder at the intensity with
which the hag prayed when she entreated us to close up those
mouths. She had lived alongside that morass till the terror of the
place had entered into her soul. And the Lord only knows how many
she had seen swallowed up during her lifetime.</p>

<p>We coasted the shore of the sea of mud, walking in single file
between a mass of nipa-palm and the slime. In the moonlight we
could see distinctly the long rocky island to which we had crossed
under Nao's guidance, but on the spot where we then were it was
much farther from the shore than it was at the point where the
sleepless one had kept his watch. No rope could bridge the gulf of
mud that separated us from it at the point where the hag brought
us.</p>

<p>"I think she means to make us swim it," growled Chico. "I can't
see how we are going to get to the island in any other way."</p>

<p>A wild howl came down the wind from the direction of the cliff,
and we guessed that the Panther had infused enough courage into his
horde to enable them to make another attack upon the cave. And we
well understood what would follow the fruitless rush upon the empty
chamber in the rock. As the moon rose beyond the haze which covered
the Mouths of Boorsh we knew that the headhunters would find their
courage, and they would then set out to scour the jungle in search
of us.</p>

<p>"Tell Nao to make the old crone hurry," said Morgan. "If we're
not mighty quick in finding some kind of a burrow to hide in we'll
never carry the Big Sword to Benares."</p>

<p>The hag stopped as Chico finished speaking, carefully measured
the distance between the butt of a tapang tree and the morass,
then, walking to the very edge of the channel, she looked across
the sea of bubbling slime. There was no caked surface here like
that upon which we had walked when crossing to the rocky island on
the night we reached the <i>kampong</i>. The mud was alive! It
bubbled up incessantly, and in the moonlight we stood and watched
it swirl around in curious eddies as if the blades of a huge
propeller were moving slowly a hundred fathoms beneath the
surface.</p>

<p>The hag stood upon the edge of the channel and lifted her skinny
hands high above her head. It seemed to us that she was making some
sort of invocation to that place, and at the moment we were in no
mood to witness a performance of that kind. The night breeze
carried to our ears the howls of our pursuers, and as we watched
the emaciated form of the old woman, a dim suspicion formed within
our brains that she was either crazy or that she had lured us to
the spot so that the Panther could surround us with his howling
warriors.</p>

<p>"She's fooling us!" cried Templeton. "The old witch is
humbugging us! What&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Red made a spring forward as he stopped speaking, but he was too
late to grab the Mother of the Years. She had jumped straight out
into the mud, landed at a point about four feet from the shore, but
instead of disappearing bodily as we thought she surely would, she
only sank in the stuff till her knees were covered!</p>

<p>"She has struck bottom!" cried Morgan.</p>

<p>The hag turned herself carefully and started to chatter to Nao,
and the Golden One passed on the remarks to Red.</p>

<p>"She says that there are ten steps between here and that black
rock," explained Templeton. "They are the length of a short spear
from each other, and if we miss them we will sink in that mud,
which is deeper than the tallest tapang tree."</p>

<p>"And what awaits us at that black rock?" asked Chico.</p>

<p>"The Passage of the Glow-worms starts from that point. It leads
from there under the rest of the channel to the island."</p>

<p>Morgan whistled in astonishment as the hag turned her face from
us and looked steadily at the mud in front of her as if her keen
black eyes were attempting to discover that second step hidden
beneath two feet of thick mud. It was an eerie business. If she
missed that second step and went down into that buttery mass it was
a certainty that none of us would have the heart to make a second
test. She had informed us that the passage had not been used, for
half a century, and we were fearful lest those steps had been swept
away during the years.</p>

<p>"Keep your eye on the spot where she is standing!" cried
Templeton. "The steps must be small by the cautious way she goes
about it. You'll go next, Morgan, so watch where she springs
from."</p>

<p>Chico moved to the bank and we watched the hag with breathless
interest. For a full minute she stared at the mud in front of her,
then she sprang.</p>

<p>"She's hit it!" cried Red. "Now, Morgan! Do you think you can
jump? I'd go in front, but I want to guard the rear with the sword
in case the beggars discover us before we're in the passage."</p>

<p>"I can jump it," muttered Chico. "Here goes!"</p>

<p>Chico sprang, hit the mud with a splash, sank to his knees, and
stood upright.</p>

<p>We were breathing hard just then. If the Mother of the Years
found a step missing at the other end of the submerged route we
wondered if we could find our way back over that trail. It seemed
the craziest gamble that we had ever taken, but it was our only
chance at that moment.</p>

<p>The hag hopped to number three and landed safely, and Nao took
Chico's place. Our nerves were on a tension just then. The Golden
One was praying softly, and we were pleased that she was praying.
We had a firm conviction that we wanted all the protection that
prayers could bring at that minute.</p>

<p>"Now, Gung!" cried Templeton. "Don't take your eyes from the
spot where the girl is standing, and spring for it the moment she
jumps to the next."</p>

<p>That Hindu was shivering like a Tamil with the ague, but he
moved to the edge of the morass as Red directed him to. The Mother
of the Years made another leap, and when Chico and Nao moved along,
Gung offered his spirit to Buddha and made the spring. He landed
with a mighty splash, slipped upon the step, recovered himself, and
stood upright.</p>

<p>"Good boy!" said Templeton. "Keep your eyes to the front and
watch your next landing-place. Now, Lenford!"</p>

<p>A yell came from the jungle as the old woman landed on step
number five, and I was a bit reckless as I moved to the edge of the
morass and jumped. The mud might be as deep as the Golden Well of
Tingeran, but a worse fate was behind us. If we met death in the
morass we would at least go to our graves in one piece, while the
Panther would hack us up in a manner that was not nice to
contemplate.</p>

<p>It was a curious sensation that clutched me when my feet hit the
mud. A horrible fear that I had miscalculated the distance gripped
me as I sank. A cold perspiration came out upon my body, and I was
on the point of crying out in terror when my feet struck a fiat
stone and I stood upright. I had successfully covered one tenth of
the journey.</p>

<p>"Can you jump and carry the sword?" I cried back to
Templeton.</p>

<p>"Sure," he answered. "Keep your eyes in front of you and don't
worry about me."</p>

<p>Gung sprang to number three as the line moved ahead, and I
landed squarely upon the spot he had left. Fear for my own life
left me at that moment. A horrible dread lest Templeton, carrying
the sword, should miss his footing, came upon me, and it required a
great effort on my part to keep my eyes upon the figure of Gung
immediately in front of me.</p>

<p>"Are you all right?" I asked, as I heard Red splash heavily in
the slime.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," he answered. "Don't speak too loud, the brutes
are close to us."</p>

<p>Out of the night came a howl that told us that the horde was on
our trail, and Gung had hardly left the perch in front of me when I
sprang for it. The deadly blowpipes were in our minds at that
moment, and the fact that we would have our backs turned to the
sharpshooters made the thought of acting as targets more
unpleasant.</p>

<p>"Don't get excited!" said Templeton. "Take it easy! The old lady
is on number seven."</p>

<p>"I wish I was there," I breathed. "This frog game is too slow
when that crowd is behind us."</p>

<p>Gung took another hop and I followed him. So far there were no
steps missing. Nao's prayers came back to us as she breathed them
softly into the night, while the Hindu uttered a strange little
invocation each time he found the stone step under his sinking
feet. I guess that Gung was telling Buddha he would never leave
Banjermassin for the rest of his life if he got back safe from the
trip.</p>

<p>Fear for the sword made my hair prickle every time Templeton
took a leap in the rear, and I knew that Chico was crazy with
anxiety about the blade as he hopped away in front of us.</p>

<p>I struck number six and Red gave a big sigh of relief. "The old
woman is on number ten," he breathed. "There are no breaks in the
path. Glory be! we'll beat them yet!"</p>

<p>Slowly, carefully, one after the other, we hopped from one stone
to the other as we made for the black rock. Once Gung nearly broke
the chain. His feet slipped upon the eighth rock as he landed upon
it, and his yell of fear went into the night.</p>

<p>"That will bring them on us now!" cried Templeton. "Hop along,
you idiot! You'll get a dart in your back if you unloose another
yell like that!"</p>

<p>Gung took number nine like a toad on the homestretch, and I
followed on his heels. A cry came from the shore, and Chico,
standing on the rock, urged us to make speed.</p>

<p>"They're coming!" he whispered. "Quick, Red! Quick!"</p>

<p>Templeton nearly landed on top of me as I sprang upon the black
rock, and we rushed madly forward to the spot where the hag was
standing.</p>

<p>"Where is the passage?" cried Chico. "Where did she go?"</p>

<p>The Mother of the Years had slipped into an opening about four
feet wide in the side of the rock, and we rushed in without pausing
to investigate. The moonlight had shown us the headhunters upon the
very path down which we had followed the ancient female to the sea
of mud, and we had no desire to make a close examination of any
spot that offered us a haven from the poisoned darts.</p>

<p>"We must keep together," cried Red. "Look out! There's a light
in front! What the mischief is it?"</p>

<p>Chico stopped, then he stumbled forward with a laugh of
relief.</p>

<p>"Glow-worms," he answered. "This is the passage&mdash;the
Passage of the Glow-worms!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch21" name="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The Black Curtain</p>

<p class="first"><br>
IT was a strange sight that we saw in that passage. The stalactites
hanging from the roof of the place were covered with glowworms, and
the faint blue glimmer startled us as we followed in the footsteps
of the hag. There were millions of the insects. The dampness of the
tunnel attracted them, and as the Mother of the Years had informed
Nao that the passage had been named more than a half a century
before, we understood that it had been a camping place for the
insects for many years.</p>

<p>"Ask her where the opening at the other end will land us," said
Morgan. "This is a witch chamber!"</p>

<p>Templeton put Chico's question to Nao, and while the hag stopped
to make an explanation to the Golden One, we managed to manufacture
a crude torch by setting fire to the bark-cloth bandages soaked in
fat which Nao had bound around Morgan after his battle with the
Spotted Panther.</p>

<p>"She says that the passage will bring us out close to the place
of the swinging ropes," translated Red. "We cannot dodge that spot.
We must pass by it in order to find the path that will lead us
across the Million Mouths of Boorsh."</p>

<p>"They'll have a chance of getting us there," I said.</p>

<p>"The ropes are cut," said Templeton.</p>

<p>"But the blowpipes," growled Morgan. "The channel is narrow, and
there will be little protection for us."</p>

<p>"We must try and dodge them," said Templeton cheerfully. "Luck
has been with us up to the present, and I believe it will stay.
They know nothing about this passage and they will never expect us
to come out at that point."</p>

<p>The hag's bare feet were pattering on ahead of us, and we
slipped and stumbled after her across the rocky floor of the
passage that was wet with the moisture that soaked in from the
buttery mud that completely covered the rock in whose hollowed-out
interior we were running. The glow-worms were the greatest wonder
of that place. They covered the stalactites in such quantities that
the hanging pieces of rock resembled great masses of glimmering
light.</p>

<p>We had strange notions regarding that passage&mdash;notions
probably arising from want of food and sleep&mdash;and as I
listened to the patter of the feet of the Mother of the Years, I
thought that we would be compelled to carry the Great Parang of
Buddha through that slimy passage for all eternity. The echoes
sprang up and raced away in front of us&mdash;raced away down the
weird tunnel which the glowworms faintly illuminated.</p>

<p>On and on we ran. The light of the torch flung strange shadows
in front of us, lighting up the roof of the place, from which hung
the stalactites. The place was a nightmare. As we ran we pictured
the great morass above our heads, separated only by a layer of rock
the thinness of which was evident by the moisture which seeped into
the passage.</p>

<p>"It is an infernal place," growled Morgan.</p>

<p>Templeton nodded his head. "But we're in luck," he said. "If we
hadn't spoken to the old hag we would never have escaped from the
<i>kampong</i>."</p>

<p>The passage was not more than ten feet across at its widest
point, and its height rarely exceeded eight feet. Here and there it
narrowed so that as we stumbled along we could touch the rocky
sides with our outstretched hands, while the roof came down so
close that we ran in a crouching position. It was wonderful how
nature had formed that strange tunnel beneath the mud.</p>

<p>"It reminds me of the New York subways," said Morgan, "only
there are no trains."</p>

<p>"And the Panther is the third rail that we're scared of,"
growled Red.</p>

<p>In some places the peculiar formation of the tunnel did bring
remembrances of the subways in Manhattan. Occasionally the torch
lit up a section of the arched roof that seemed as if it had been
chiselled by man.</p>

<p>The passage did not move directly forward, but wound about by a
zigzag route, so that we were convinced that we would have to
travel more than six times the actual distance which lay between
the hidden steps and the place of the swinging ropes.</p>

<p>"We'll never get out of it," said Morgan, after we had been
running for some time. "This infernal place runs into the bowels of
the earth."</p>

<p>"We'll get out," said Templeton. "Keep running, man! Keep
running!"</p>

<p>"But it seems without end," said Morgan. "We
will&mdash;&mdash;Suffering grasshoppers! what's up?"</p>

<p>Chico's exclamation was caused by the action of the hag. The
Mother of the Years, who had been leading the procession, stopped
suddenly. Templeton cannoned violently against her, and Morgan, the
Golden One, and Gung collided with Red before they could pull
up.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" cried Morgan. "What's the matter with her?"</p>

<p>The Mother of the Years uttered a strange whine of fear, and
Morgan grasped the torch and held it up high in an endeavour to
find out the cause of her terror.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Templeton. <i>"Look!"</i></p>

<p>It was then that we saw the great black curtain that effectually
barred our way. The thick mud from the morass was oozing slowly
down through the roof, forming a shining black wall immediately in
our path, and passing away through the floor of the tunnel into
some underground pit of which we knew nothing.</p>

<p>The tunnel was completely blocked by this black curtain, upon
which the light of the torch shone as we stared at it. It was a
terrible sight. We understood that the strata had been disrupted in
some way so that a crevice had formed in the roof and also in the
floor of the tunnel through which the mud flowed, but whether that
moving barrier was one foot or ten feet in thickness was the great
problem that faced us at that moment.</p>

<p>"Good God!" cried Templeton. "We are cut off!"</p>

<p>As we stared in stupefied wonder at that spectacle our minds
went back to the horde of savages that we had seen charging down
toward the hidden steps at the moment we entered the tunnel. We
were in a trap. Our retreat was cut off, and the black barrier
effectually prevented us from going forward.</p>

<p>Quietly, ever so quietly, the flowing mud passed before us. It
was a moving curtain that rolled down before our eyes like an
endless strip of black velvet. And the silence with which it flowed
terrified us. It made no noise outside a slight gurgling that now
and then came to our ears from the opening in the floor of the
tunnel through which it disappeared.</p>

<p>The hag stood and spoke to Nao, and the Golden One, wide-eyed
with terror and wonder, translated to Templeton.</p>

<p>"She says that it was never here before," growled Red,
translating what Nao had told him. "She thinks it must have been
done by an <i>aintu</i> to block our escape."</p>

<p>"I suppose this is the real reason why the tunnel has not been
used," said Chico. "This probably happened fifty years ago and the
hag has known nothing of it. We're trapped!"</p>

<p>We had no doubt about the hag's ignorance of that barrier. Her
astonishment could not have been assumed. Her little black eyes
expressed her terror as she raced up and down in front of the
obstacle. She was the most surprised one of the party, and her
vanity was considerably hurt by the happening. She had promised us
that she would lead us to the place of the swinging ropes, and now
she had proved herself incapable of fulfilling her promises.</p>

<p>"We are done!" cried Morgan. "We might as well go back and take
our chances with the mob."</p>

<p>For about five minutes we stood and stared at the obstruction
that had come in our path. Gung was the only one who could not
stand and look at it. Fear loosened the muscles of the Hindu's
knees and he fell upon the floor and squirmed as he had done on the
night when the orang-utan legion stampeded the Dyak carriers.</p>

<p>"Get up!" cried Templeton. "Get up, I say!"</p>

<p>But Gung could not get to his feet. He was a gibbering idiot,
with eyes bulging with terror. He rolled around on the wet floor,
chanting scraps of prayers to every saint in the Hindu
calendar.</p>

<p>Templeton moved close to the curtain and thrust his arm into it.
The tremendous weight of the falling mud bore upon his muscular
forearm, but he held it steady, and thrust it forward till his
shoulder was close the moving cataract. We watched him in silence.
The thickness of the mud avalanche concerned us at that moment, but
we were not too hopeful regarding the chances which Red had of
finding out the breadth by the test he applied.</p>

<p>"It is probably a couple of yards through to the other side,"
said Chico. "Perhaps the rest of the tunnel has been swept away.
Ask the old woman how far does she think we are from the end of the
passage, Red?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Templeton, still with his hand thrust into the mud, put the
question through Nao to the Mother of the Years and then translated
her answer. "She says that we are quite close to the opening that
will bring us above ground," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, I think the opening has been swept away," growled Morgan.
"That is my opinion."</p>

<p>Templeton stepped back from the mud and looked at his arm. "I
think it is just a thin curtain flowing through a crevice in the
roof and in the floor," he said. "If I can judge by the pressure on
my arm it is not more than eighteen inches thick."</p>

<p>Chico stepped forward without speaking, and he imitated
Templeton by thrusting his bare arm into the curtain. For a moment
he stood without speaking, then he stepped back and looked at
Red.</p>

<p>"I believe you're right," he said. "I have a belief that the
tunnel is continued on the other side of this barrier."</p>

<p>We were standing in a little circle looking helplessly at each
other. The hag did not understand what Templeton and Chico had
said, but when Nao explained, she brightened visibly, and again
started to chatter furiously.</p>

<p>"How can we test it?" asked Morgan.</p>

<p>"There is only one way," said Red. "That is by one of us jumping
through it."</p>

<p>He spoke quietly, but there was a strained note in his voice
that made us understand that he fully realized the danger to the
one making that test.</p>

<p>Chico Morgan stepped back eight or ten feet from the
obstruction, and for a moment we did not I realize what he intended
to do. Then it dawned upon Templeton as he looked at that plucky
boy pulling the Hindu out of his way so that he would have a clear
run at the mud barrier in an endeavour to hurl himself through it
on the possibility of the tunnel being continued on the other
side.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Red. "Don't be foolish! Let us wait a moment! We
might think out a way of testing the actual thickness."</p>

<p>"There is no way of testing it but by taking a chance," said
Morgan quietly. "Don't stop me, Templeton! If I don't come back,
you'll know that it is impassable."</p>

<p>Now as I write the story of Morgan's bravery, I ponder over the
cool manner in which he proposed to test the obstruction that
blocked our path. There wasn't a sign of fear upon his face, and as
I held the torch up high so that he could have a clear run, I noted
the grim smile upon his clean-cut features. It was the old
confident smile with which he had met the first rush of the Panther
when the big brute sprang at him. Fear was a stranger to Chico
Morgan, and in no moment did he show his tremendous courage so well
as he did in that eerie Passage of the Glow-worms.</p>

<p>"Look out!" he cried. "I am going to settle the question!"</p>

<p>I opened my mouth to utter a final warning but I had no time to
speak. Morgan took a flying rush, hit the curtain of mud with
tremendous force and disappeared.</p>

<p>We experienced a horrid choking sensation as we stared at the
place where we had last seen Chico. It seemed as if he had been
suddenly blotted out of our lives. The black curtain rolled on with
the same slow movement that had held us spellbound when we first
saw it, and our imaginations pictured Chico being borne into some
great subterranean cavern by the weight of the falling mud. We were
stupefied. We were unable to move or think. Our throats became dry
and parched, and in my own case, I know that I could not have
uttered a word if my life had depended upon it. That moving barrier
was death itself, and I wondered dully how we could have stood by
and watched Chico commit an act that we were certain had led him to
his death.</p>

<p>For fully two minutes we stood and stared at that wall of mud,
but those two minutes appeared to be centuries. The Mother of the
Years was making a curious gurgling noise, while Gung still
squirming on the floor, stared at the obstacle with bulging
eyes.</p>

<p>But it was the expression of terror upon the face of the Golden
One that held me that moment. Fear had sprung upon her and clutched
her in its grip. She seemed as if she had been turned to stone the
moment that Morgan had disappeared from view.</p>

<p>"Mother o' me!" cried Templeton. "Mother o'&mdash;-"</p>

<p>Red's exclamation was interrupted by a happening which set our
hearts pounding madly. The curtain of mud was disturbed by a ball
of filth-covered humanity that came hurtling through, and Chico
stumbled over the squirming Gung and fell upon the floor of the
tunnel. He had come back to us!</p>

<p>We fell upon him, wiping the mud from his face, the Golden One
and the Mother of Years lending a hand in the work. Nao tore a
piece from her wonderful <i>sarong</i> and in a moment the
spluttering Chico was able to breathe. Then we sat him up and
waited till he could speak, while the Golden One held his hands and
watched him with eyes that were filled with moisture.</p>

<p>"What is the answer?" asked Templeton. "Tell us! Quick!"</p>

<p>Chico put his big hands over the little hand of Nao and patted
it softly. "We are safe!" he cried. "We are safe!"</p>

<p>"How thick is it?" questioned Templeton.</p>

<p>"Not more than eighteen inches," answered Morgan. "The tunnel is
continued on the other side, and twenty yards farther on is the
opening of which the Mother of the Years has told us."</p>

<p>We thrilled as we listened to Chico's story. Once again fate had
been kind to us and had given us a chance to escape from a position
that looked hopeless. A moment before Chico's return we were
without hope, but our hearts swelled as we grasped the fact that
victory was on our side. Once through the tunnel the only danger
that was in our way was the guard that might be on duty near the
place of the swinging ropes, which we would have to pass in order
to reach the track across the stretch of the ulcer-like Mouths of
Boorsh, through which we had wound our way with Nao two nights
before.</p>

<p>Morgan got upon his feet, and still holding Nao's hand, looked
at Templeton. "We must jump through it," he said quietly. "And the
weight of the mud makes it advisable that we should help the women.
How would it be for you to hold the hand of the hag while I jump
with the Golden One?"</p>

<p>Templeton looked at the Mother of the Years as if he received
Chico's proposition with some disfavour, but with a grim smile upon
his face he explained the matter to Nao so that she could translate
to the old woman.</p>

<p>"Gung and Lenford can jump by themselves," continued Morgan. "Go
on, Templeton, get ready. Jump straight through with all the
strength you can put into your limbs."</p>

<p>Nao explained the matter to the hag, and the old woman walked up
quietly and put her skinny claw in Templeton's big hand.</p>

<p>"Now for it," said Red. "Mrs. Methuselah and I will lead the
dance."</p>

<p>The big Englishman and the old crone walked back a few yards and
then rushed forward at the mud barrier. At any other moment the
sight of that crone running beside the tall Britisher would have
been ludicrous, but at that moment our mirth was chilled by the
strange obstacle that barred our path to liberty. Fear choked our
laughter, and we watched with bulging eyes the big man and the old
woman strike the barrier. They disappeared as Chico had done, while
the curtain of mud moved on as if it had not been disturbed by
their assault upon it.</p>

<p>For about two minutes we stood and stared at it, then Morgan
took Gung by the shoulders, shook him gently, and explained the
task that was before him. The Hindu was shivering with fear. For
the moment when he had been pushed up to us on the slope above the
<i>kampong</i> he was in a condition of complete collapse, and now
that he had come face to face with another terrifying obstacle, he
had broken down completely.</p>

<p>"Gung," said Chico, gripping him by the thin shoulders, "you
must rush at the curtain and spring clean through it. You'll do it.
It is an easy matter. Come back here and take a good run at it.
Don't be afraid. Templeton and the hag are on the other side."</p>

<p>He dragged Gung back to a distance of about ten paces from the
curtain of mud, turned the Hindu's face toward the barrier, and
gave him a push to send him on his way.</p>

<p>Gung gave a howl of fear, charged madly along the uneven floor
of the tunnel, and sprang at the mud wall. I have a vivid picture
on my mental tablets of the way in which that Hindu disappeared.
Chico, holding the torch, flung the light upon the curtain of mud,
and the Hindu struck it with legs and arms outstretched.</p>

<p>"He looked like an old woman jumping over a fence," said Chico.
"Go on, Lenford!"</p>

<p>I confess that I was as terrified as Gung as I faced the
obstacle, but there was no possibility of evading that jump. I took
a short run and sprang wildly at the barrier, struck the moving
curtain, and for a moment had a horrible sensation that I was being
sucked down by the avalanche. The mud was suffocating. The buttery
mass seemed to grip one like a great wet hand, but before the
downward suction could pull me below the floor of the tunnel, I had
broken through on the other side, and fell full length upon the
floor. Templeton and the hag lifted me to my feet, and before I had
wiped the mud from my face, Morgan and the Golden One were beside
us. We had no torch then, and we could not see each other.</p>

<p>"Are you right?" asked Templeton.</p>

<p>"I'm right," said Chico. "Where's Lenford?"</p>

<p>"I am here," I answered.</p>

<p>"Come on then," ordered Chico. "Do you see the entrance? It's
only twenty yards away."</p>

<p>"Where's Gung?" asked Templeton.</p>

<p>No answer came to the query, and a cold chill gripped us.</p>

<p>"Gung!" cried Morgan; "Gung, where the devil are you?
<i>Gung!</i>"</p>

<p>There was no answer to the cry. For a minute we stood in the
darkness without speaking, then Templeton broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Did he jump?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He took the jump before Lenford," answered Morgan.</p>

<p>"Well, he is gone," said the Englishman quietly. "He didn't come
through. He has been sucked below the floor."</p>

<p>Morgan foraged in his pockets, found a dry match, and scratched
it against the wall of the tunnel. The light flared up, but there
was no sign of Gung. The mud curtain was slowly unrolling itself
like an endless strip of black cloth, and we shivered as we looked
at it. It was plain to us what had happened. The Hindu, in his weak
state, had been sucked down by the tremendous weight of the falling
mud, and with a feeling of horror we five stepped back from the
barrier which we had successfully overcome.</p>

<p>"There is no way of helping him," said Morgan, "and we must go
on. Come along; the opening is in front. I'm sorry, but we must
save ourselves." And with a sick feeling at our hearts, we turned
from the black curtain and rushed forward.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch22" name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="chaphead">How The Panther Came Back</p>

<p class="first"><br>
THE opening of the tunnel showed up before us like a bright silver
dollar as we rounded the turn in the passage after leaving the mud
barrier.</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Morgan. "We're right now. Give me a turn at
carrying the sword, Templeton; I'm feeling splendid."</p>

<p>Red turned over the Great Parang to Chico as we raced up the
little slope toward the spot where we saw the welcome moonbeams. It
was long after midnight as we neared the round opening, and the
stillness of the outside world seemed to impress us curiously as we
crawled out upon the rocky island. The channel was barely thirty
feet wide at this point, and the mangrove-covered shoreline on the
<i>kampong</i> side was quite distinct in the moonlight. But we
knew from the landmarks that we were quite some distance from the
spot where the sleepless guardian had received us on the night we
swung across the channel.</p>

<p>There were no signs of the Spotted Panther's band, and with a
feeling that we might pass the danger point without being seen, we
ran forward at our best speed, taking full advantage of the shelter
which the scattered boulders afforded us. We were between two evils
at that moment. On our left as we ran stretched the Mouths of
Boorsh, unfordable at that point because the Dyaks had discovered
no path through the many shivering mouths, while on our right the
channel of bubbling mud separated us from the jungle that lay close
to the <i>kampong</i>.</p>

<p>It was at this point In the flight that the pace seemed to tell
on the Golden One. The wild run through the night had tired her,
and as we neared the place where the ropes had been suspended
across the channel, she dropped to the tail end of the procession.
Chico, carrying the Great Sword, was running immediately in front
of her, while Templeton and I were trotting behind the old woman,
who covered ground with a tireless lope that astonished us. That
old hag was a wonderful advertisement for the simple life. She
could outrun a wolf with those skinny legs that one would never
associate with speed or endurance.</p>

<p>The Mother of the Years pointed ahead, and we understood that we
were close to the narrow neck of the channel, where the followers
of the Panther would probably be on guard. But we were forced to
run the blockade. Our only hope lay in slipping quietly by this
danger point and hurrying across the Mouths of Boorsh by the path
which the Golden One had led us over two nights before. Any delay
was abhorrent to us just then. Luck had been with us on that
strange journey, and as we stumbled toward the point where
One-Who-Never-Slept had collapsed when Templeton had proved himself
such a skilful marksman, we felt certain that we would get by in
safety. We thought that nothing could stop us from carrying away
the Great Parang. We thought that the weapon, like the magic blade
with which Attila the Hun crimsoned the plains of Europe, could
never be taken from a man who wielded it well, and none could swing
that blade like Chico Morgan and Red Templeton.</p>

<p>The old woman glanced at Red inquiringly as we turned a corner,
but the big Englishman waved her on.</p>

<p>"Never mind them!" he cried, forgetting in his excitement that
she could not speak English. "Go straight ahead and let them
scream! We're on the home track and we don't care for a million of
them."</p>

<p>The hag dashed around a big boulder in the direction of the
baked surface of the morass, and we wasted no time in following
her. The landing place where the watcher had guarded the swinging
ropes was nearly opposite, and we were anxious to gain the shelter
of the rocks behind which Templeton and I had crouched when Nao had
given the signal to One-Who-Never-Slept. If we reached those rocks
we would be safe. The track across the gurgling quagmire would be
immediately in front of us, and we would be well on our way to the
Ban to before the Panther and his followers had discovered the
hidden stepping-stones by which we had made our way to the Passage
of the Glowworms.</p>

<p>The old woman dashed across the open space opposite the big
tapang tree from which the rope had been swinging, and Red
Templeton followed her into safety behind the rocks. Morgan and I
raced swiftly on their heels, but while Chico and Nao were still
upon the bare, moon-washed ridge of stone that was worn smooth with
the countless feet of the savages who had swung backward and
forward across the channel, a yell came from the other side of the
river of mud, and we knew that our retreat was discovered.</p>

<p>The yell had a peculiar, paralyzing effect upon me. I tried to
keep my face turned toward the morass, but the tremendous scream of
rage compelled me to turn my head and look toward the shore.
Rushing down the slope, up which we had climbed after disposing of
the body of the sleepless one, came the Spotted Panther!</p>

<p>I have a dim recollection that Morgan halted as if he was
hypnotized by the sight of that charging savage. And I know that
the Golden One turned and watched him. The knowledge that the ropes
were cut made us intensely curious to know what the savage would do
when he reached the leaping-off stone upon the bank. The picture
comes back to me vividly as I write. I can see now upon the film of
my mind the mighty form of the Panther, and I remember that I
noticed, as he dashed down the slope, the moonbeams flashing upon
the Great Parang of Buddha that Morgan carried. Chico was between
me and the channel of mud, and nearer still to the dividing gulf of
bubbling slime was the Golden One, who had lagged' behind from the
moment we left the Passage of the Glowworms.</p>

<p>No one spoke as the Dyak chieftain dashed down the bank. A
silence followed the yell&mdash;a curious silence as if we sensed
an impending tragedy. The speed with which the brown giant was
racing down the hill made us wonder stupidly regarding his
intentions, and we guessed blindly as to what he intended to
do.</p>

<p>The Panther reached the edge of the channel, and Red Templeton
gave a cry of surprise. I think Chico and I echoed that cry. The
sight appalled us. The big brown man crouched as he reached the
edge, then, gathering himself together, he hurled himself across
the channel of mud!</p>

<p>I do not think that any athlete since time began ever made a
leap equal to the one the Spotted Panther made that night on the
shores of the Mouths of Boorsh. I am certain that no one ever
equalled that great jump. The Rajputs tell of a Mongol chief who
sprang across a great chasm in the Karakoram Hills, but I'll wager
that chasm was not as wide as the river of slime across which the
chief of the Orang Bukkit hurled his great body. He rose from the
rock like a winged thing, swept over the bubbling depths, and
landed on our side of the channel with a full three feet to
spare!</p>

<p>It was Red Templeton who first recovered the use of his wits.
The sight of that brute hurtling through the air had paralyzed our
thought centres, and it was only when Templeton gave a cry of
warning that we recognized the danger. The Golden One, being at the
tail end of the procession, was the closest of our party to the
Panther, and as he rushed toward her, we realized that Morgan could
not reach the side of the girl in time to save her from the kris
that flashed in the hand of the gigantic savage.</p>

<p>Chico Morgan realized the impending calamity at the moment that
Templeton cried out his warning. Morgan's revolver was empty, and
death was springing toward Nao with mighty leaps. The girl was so
stunned that she was unable to run from the attacking giant. The
silvery whiteness of the Panther's face struck terror into her
heart, and her limbs lacked the strength to carry her toward Chico
so that he would have an opportunity of obstructing the murderous
rush of the savage.</p>

<p>It was then that Morgan acted. He swung the Great Parang of
Buddha around his head till it made a halo of silver light as the
moonbeams kissed its shining blade, then he loosened his grip and
sent the Great Sword flying through the air at the leaping
Panther!</p>

<p>I shall see the picture of that flying blade in my dreams for
all time. It haunts me. I wake in the night gripped by that same
agony that held me at that moment. I shall dream of the incident
till I die. The Great Sword, released from Chico's grip, drove
toward the Panther like a spear of light. And the big savage seemed
to sense death in its approach. He gave a cry of fear that was shut
off abruptly as the point struck him in the breast with terrific
force, and he staggered backward. Temple-ton sprang forward, but
Red was too late. The edge of the river of mud was close to the
Panther when the blade struck, and the force with which Chico
hurled the weapon drove him over the brink. When we reached the
side of the channel of black slime there was not even an air bubble
to denote the spot where the Spotted Panther had disappeared with
the Great Parang of Buddha driven deep into his broad chest!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch23" name="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="chaphead">Love Rules The World</p>

<p class="first"><br>
IT was the voice of the Mother of the Years that roused us from the
stupor that fell upon us when the wonderful sword disappeared from
our sight. Something seemed to have snapped in our brains when we
saw the Spotted Panther reel backward, and we were oblivious to all
danger as we stared at the black mud. We had thrown ourselves full
length upon the smooth rock, and we stared in wide-eyed horror at
the mud that swirled around in curious eddies that had a snaky
appearance in the moonlight.</p>

<p>The hag was calling one word into the silent night, and that
word brought a group of the Panther's warriors to the other side of
the channel. And the meaning of her chant became plain to us as she
repeated it over and over again. She had used the same word in
speaking of Gung when he had been brought forward as a sacrifice,
and we understood in a vague way that she was shrieking out the
news that we had chosen the Panther as a sacrifice in the ceremony
connected with the closing of the Mouths of Boorsh. And we
understood more. As we glanced at her skinny arms that nailed the
night air that was filled with all the strange odours of the East,
we knew that she was asking the awestruck group upon the other side
of the channel to be patient as the great quagmire would become
solid ground the moment the sacrifice was accepted.</p>

<p>Red Templeton gripped my shoulder and shook me till my scattered
wits returned. Chico Morgan was standing beside Red, his arm
supporting the Golden One, and their eyes were fixed upon the
Mother of the Years, whose shrill shouts went out like red-hot
wires into the stillness that seemed to come upon that place the
moment the Panther disappeared.</p>

<p>"We had better get away before they lose their temper," said Red
speaking in a strange, quiet tone. "They are liable to hurt
somebody if a miracle doesn't happen around here within the next
few hours."</p>

<p>"But the sword?" I gurgled. "Couldn't we&mdash;couldn't we
try&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nao says the channel is deeper than the big tapang tree in the
clearing," interrupted Templeton. "We cannot recover it. We'll
leave the old woman to soothe them while we sneak away
quietly."</p>

<p>I shall always remember the journey across the morass where the
green-edged mouths quivered as we came close to them. And of one
incident in that walk I have a particularly vivid recollection.
Halfway across that place of terror I walked so close to one of
those quivering mouths that the thing managed to throw over me a
peculiar fascination so that I was unable to turn away from it. I
tried to cry out to Templeton, but my tongue refused to utter the
words. And the green mouth slobbered as my footsteps shook the
flaky crust that surrounded the aperture. I had a belief that it
was laughing jovially at the fact that its weird power was dragging
me toward it.</p>

<p>It was Chico who saved me from the green-lipped ulcer. He came
swiftly behind me and dragged me back from the very edge of the
thing.</p>

<p>"Shake yourself together, Lenford," he said, when he had dragged
me to a safe place. "Forget the sword, boy. We have a long way to
go before we get to Banjermassin."</p>

<p>But I could not forget the Great Parang. Those shivering mouths
appeared to mock our failure as we followed Nao along the path that
twisted like a serpent between their greedy lips. And the gurgling
noises struck terror into our hearts. The place was vicious. Those
ulcer-like openings were possessed of a strange hypnotic power that
terrified us. I think that the stoical Morgan and the stolid
Englishman felt that power before we reached solid ground. When the
fringe of the jungle came toward us as we neared the place where we
had lain and watched the two pigs go down in that morass, we four,
Temple-ton, Morgan, Nao, and I, started to run, and despite Nao's
protests that we were endangering our lives by moving at any speed
over the caked surface, we could not control our legs. The fear
sprang upon us at that moment. The terror of that place, which had
been growing since the night we crossed it, broke out of bounds now
that our thoughts had been withdrawn from the Great Parang, and we
were crazy men.</p>

<p>The Golden One called out to Templeton, but we refused to obey
Red's order when he translated her message.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he cried. "She says that we'll break the crust! Stop!
We'll all go down if we're not careful!"</p>

<p>But we could not stop. Gibbering terror was at our heels and we
could not control our legs. I had the belief that the mouths were
reaching out to each other to engulf us, and every now and then I
would spring wildly into the air as my imagination fooled me into
the belief that new mouths were forming beneath our feet.</p>

<p>Even Templeton ran after he had screamed the warning of the
Golden One. Our flight became a mad stampede in which caution was
thrown to the winds. The solid ground loomed up in front of us, and
we had not sufficient control over ourselves to cover the
intervening distance at a safe gait.</p>

<p>I passed Templeton in that wild race. I outstripped Chico, who
was running by the side of the Golden One. The shore reached out to
us and we could not stop. There was safety beneath the silent trees
of mohor and sandalwood that stood upon the solid ground and
watched us as we raced madly toward the shore, our souls flayed
with the ten-thonged whip of fear that our imaginations laid upon
us.</p>

<p>I heard the Golden One give a scream of fear, but I didn't look
back. I couldn't. The shore was only a few feet away, and I flung
myself forward. And even then the terror did not leave me. I
crashed through the vines and ran on till I had placed fifty yards
between myself and the morass. Then I flung myself on the grass and
waited. I had proved myself a coward in the face of the uncanny
mouths that slobbered as we rushed by.</p>

<p>Chico Morgan, with the Golden One upon his shoulders, staggered
on to the little clearing where I was resting my fear-stricken
limbs, and as I glanced up at the girl I understood the reason for
the scream of terror which I had heard as I reached the bank. As
Chico laid her down upon the grass she reached out and attempted to
kiss his hands.</p>

<p>"Don't! Please don't!" cried Chico. "Keep a stiff upper lip and
we'll pull through."</p>

<p>"Did she&mdash;did she slip into one?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nearly," answered Morgan. "We managed to catch her by throwing
ourselves full length upon the crust." Then he lifted the girl upon
her feet, and with Red and me following, ran forward on the path
that led to the cross.</p>

<p>It was some time in the forenoon when we reached the stone cross
in the jungle, and it was only then that I managed to shake myself
free from the stupor which had fallen upon me when the Great Parang
disappeared in the channel of mud. I came to my senses when Nao
asked me by signs to kneel beside Red Templeton and Morgan, and I
promptly obeyed her command. I didn't pray, but I listened while
the Golden One made the same soft little prayer that she had sent
into the still air on the morning we met her there. I know that
Chico Morgan prayed, and so did Templeton. I saw the latter while
still upon his knees take from his bosom the little miniature of
Evelyn Courtney which he had gazed at on the morning when the
man-hound was &gt;ho upon our trail as we lay in the cave above the
<i>kampong</i>. And it was then that I realized that there was
something in the world greater than riches. Templeton had forgotten
his disappointment as he thought over the one who waited for him in
Banjermassin, and Chico Morgan was returning thanks for the
strength which had enabled him to send the Great Parang of Buddha
into the breast of the Panther when he was leaping forward to kill
the one he loved. Great is love. I realized as I knelt and watched
the two men, who were as courageous as lions, the truth which the
Persian poet sang:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"The rose tree and the lotus bloom<br>
Because we love each other so,<br>
The light from your eyes makes the stars<br>
That swing high in the heaven's glow.<br>
And 'tis the love of such as we<br>
That makes the seasons come and go."</p>

<p><br>
IT was four weeks after the morning when we knelt at the little
stone cross in the jungle that we reached Banjermassin. Evelyn
Courtney was waiting for us in the bungalow within the Dream
Garden, and as she escorted us into the room where Red had shown us
the Chalice of Everlasting Fire we found Courtney sleeping off an
opium debauch on the couch he had occupied when Gung told us the
wonder story of the treasure stolen by Enrique de Gama and carried
up into the dark hills by the Orang Bukkit.</p>

<p>Courtney roused himself when he heard us talking and,
recognizing Templeton, he gave a maniacal laugh and sat
upright.</p>

<p>"Did you&mdash;did you get anything?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Red.</p>

<p>"Treasure?" gasped Courtney.</p>

<p>"Yes, treasure," said Templeton quietly, and he pointed to the
Golden One, who' was holding the hand of Evelyn Courtney as they
sat in the window seat, side by side.</p>

<p>"But the sword?" cried the opium smoker.</p>

<p>"We missed the sword," said Red, without showing the slightest
regret in his voice. "It was not decreed that we should get the
sword."</p>

<p>Very briefly he told of our trip, and when he had finished, the
opium smoker laughed loudly and made horrible grimaces.</p>

<p>"I knew it! I knew it!" he cried. "The things are cursed,
Templeton! The Chalice&mdash;the Chalice of Everlasting Fire is
gone!</p>

<p>"Gone?" said Templeton.</p>

<p>"Gone!" shrilled the opium fiend. "The Chinamen at the opium
joint stole it from me. Evelyn's fault&mdash;all Evelyn's fault!
She wouldn't give me the money for the black smoke, so&mdash;I took
the chalice. And the devils stole it while I slept, and they've
cleared out with it. The things are cursed, Templeton. You are
lucky. Lucky! You got your stake back after you laid it on the
gambling table! Your stake&mdash;your life, man! Your life!"</p>

<p>The maniac burst into another fit of laughter and flung himself
on the couch, and Red Templeton took the hand of Evelyn Courtney,
who had walked to his side.</p>

<p>"He's right," she said in a soft whisper that I overhead as I
crept away. "You might have lost your life, and all the treasure in
the world would have mattered little."</p>

<p>Chico Morgan and the Golden One were sitting in a dim nook in
the hall as I passed out upon the piazza, and, with a curious
feeling of contentment stealing over me, I sat down to breathe the
little vagrant puffs of air that came from the river. The East
seemed very, very old to me as I sat there. Scents of musk and
marigolds, of incense and jasmine, of wet earth and rotting
vegetation stirred strange thoughts within my brain. And I wondered
stupidly concerning the trick of fate by which the Great Parang had
been snatched from our hands. I pondered long over the matter. The
winds told of many things, of dark and wicked deeds, of shameful
acts which the march of civilization had stamped out. And the Great
Sword was connected with those acts which the strong hand of the
white man had made impossible. Then, out of my meditation, came a
feeling of gladness, a feeling of great joy. The Power that rules
the world had prevented us from bringing the sword from its dark
retreat. The big blade might have caused rivers of blood to flow
through the East, and, as the minutes passed by, I became convinced
that everything had happened for the best.</p>

<p>And as I sat there feeling that the death of the Panther had
been planned by the Hand which guides the universe, I heard the
soft, liquid voice of Nao speaking within the hall. And I knew that
our trip had not been in vain. The soul of a girl who was as lovely
as the dawn had been fighting for spiritual life in that lonely
<i>kampong</i> by the Million Mouths of Boorsh, and I knew that Red
Templeton, Chico Morgan, and I had done our part. Providence had a
mission for us three, and, in a blind way, led on by the lust for
gold, we had worked out His holy will.</p>
