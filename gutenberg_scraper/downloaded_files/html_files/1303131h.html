<h2>A CONTEMPORARY REVIEW</h2>

<p class="cp"><b>Readers with an aversion to spoilers may skip this section.</b></p>
<br>

<p class="quote">
Mr. Wells employs a fantastic idea not unknown to literature
in a singularly charming story. Mr. Andrew Lang in <i>In the
Wrong Paradise</i> and Hawthorne in his sketch of the <i>Snow
Child</i> described each in his fashion the effect on a prosaic
and unimaginative mind of a supernatural and improbable
phenomenon: in this story Mr. Wells brings an angel down to
earth in an appallingly rigid and censorious English
village, and shows the terrible effects which he produces
among the good scandal-mongering inhabitants, and the fatal
influence which they have on him. The humour of the
situation is delightfully worked out: the angel has no
clothes to speak of, so the vicar dresses him in his best
black suit, and manages to pass him off as a hunch-backed
genius who plays the fiddle uncommonly well. The good vicar
is almost alone in seeing what he is; the rest of them regard
him either as an escaped lunatic or as a Socialist agitator,
while their niggardly minds depress him so much that he
begins to lose his wings and to learn to know melancholy. The
satire throughout, though not perhaps particularly brilliant
or novel, is not ungenerous, and is certainly amusing, and
altogether the book is a very pleasant little <i>jeu d'esprit</i>.</p>

<h2><a id="chap01"></a>THE NIGHT OF THE STRANGE BIRD</h2>

<h3>&sect; I</h3>

<p class="first">ON the Night of the Strange Bird, many people at
Sidderton (and some nearer) saw a Glare on the Sidderford moor. But
no one in Sidderford saw it, for most of Sidderford was abed.</p>

<p>All day the wind had been rising, so that the larks on the moor
chirruped fitfully near the ground, or rose only to be driven like
leaves before the wind. The sun set in a bloody welter of clouds,
and the moon was hidden. The glare, they say, was golden like a
beam shining out of the sky, not a uniform blaze, but broken all
over by curving flashes like the waving of swords. It lasted but a
moment and left the night dark and obscure. There were letters
about it in Nature, and a rough drawing that no one thought very
like. (You may see it for yourself&mdash;the drawing that was
unlike the glare&mdash;on page 42 of Vol. cclx, of that
publication.)</p>

<p>None in Sidderford saw the light, but Annie Hooker Durgam's
wife, was lying awake, and she saw the reflection of it&mdash;a
flickering tongue of gold&mdash;dancing on the wall.</p>

<p>She, too, was one of those who heard the sound. The others who
heard the sound were Lumpy Durgan, the half&ndash;wit, and Amory's
mother. They said it was a sound like children singing and a
throbbing of harp strings, carried on a rush of notes like that
which sometimes comes from an organ. It began and ended like the
opening and shutting of a door, and before and after they heard
nothing but the night wind howling over the moor and the noise of
the caves under Sidderford cliff. Amory's mother said she wanted to
cry when she heard it, but Lumpy was only sorry he could hear no
more.</p>

<p>That is as much as anyone can tell you of the glare upon
Sidderford Moor and the alleged music therewith. And whether these
had any real connexion with the Strange Bird whose history follows,
is more than I can say. But I set it down here for reasons that
will be more apparent as the story proceeds.</p>

<h2><a id="chap02"></a>THE COMING OF THE STRANGE BIRD</h2>

<h3>&sect; II</h3>

<p class="first">SANDY BRIGHT was coming down the road from
Spinner's carrying a side of bacon he had taken in exchange for a
clock. He saw nothing of the light but he heard and saw the Strange
Bird. He suddenly heard a flapping and a voice like a woman
wailing, and being a nervous man and all alone, he was alarmed
forthwith, and turning (all a-tremble) saw something large and
black against the dim darkness of the cedars up the hill. It seemed
to be coming right down upon him, and incontinently he dropped his
bacon and set off running, only to fall headlong.</p>

<p>He tried in vain&mdash;such was his state of mind&mdash;to
remember the beginning of the Lord's Prayer. The strange bird
flapped over him, something larger than himself, with a vast spread
of wings, and, as he thought, black. He screamed and gave himself
up for lost. Then it went past him, sailing down the hill, and,
soaring over the vicarage, vanished into the hazy valley towards
Sidderford.</p>

<p>And Sandy Bright lay upon his stomach there, for ever so long,
staring into the darkness after the strange bird. At last he got
upon his knees and began to thank Heaven for his merciful
deliverance, with his eyes downhill. He went on down into the
village, talking aloud and confessing his sins as he went, lest the
strange bird should come back. All who heard him thought him drunk.
But from that night he was a changed man, and had done with
drunkenness and defrauding the revenue by selling silver ornaments
without a licence. And the side of bacon lay upon the hillside
until the tallyman from Portburdock found it in the morning.</p>

<p>The next who saw the Strange Bird was a solicitor's clerk at
Iping Hanger, who was climbing the hill before breakfast, to see
the sunrise. Save for a few dissolving wisps of cloud the sky had
been blown clear in the night. At first he thought it was an eagle
he saw. It was near the zenith, and incredibly remote, a mere
bright speck above the pink cirri, and it seemed as if it fluttered
and beat itself against the sky, as an imprisoned swallow might do
against a window pane. Then down it came into the shadow of the
earth, sweeping in a great curve towards Portburdock and round over
the Hanger, and so vanishing behind the woods of Siddermorton Park.
It seemed larger than a man. Just before it was hidden, the light
of the rising sun smote over the edge of the downs and touched its
wings, and they flashed with the brightness of flames and the
colour of precious stones, and so passed, leaving the witness
agape.</p>

<p>A ploughman going to his work, along under the stone wall of
Siddermorton Park, saw the Strange Bird flash over him for a moment
and vanish among the hazy interstices of the beech trees. But he
saw little of the colour of the wings, witnessing only that its
legs, which were long, seemed pink and bare like naked flesh, and
its body mottled white. It smote like an arrow through the air and
was gone.</p>

<p>These were the first three eye-witnesses of the Strange
Bird.</p>

<p>Now in these days one does not cower before the devil and one's
own sinfulness, or see strange iridiscent wings in the light of
dawn, and say nothing of it afterwards. The young solicitor's clerk
told his mother and sisters at breakfast, and, afterwards, on his
way to the office at Portburdock, spoke of it to the blacksmith of
Hammerpond, and spent the morning with his fellow clerks marvelling
instead of copying deeds. And Sandy Bright went to talk the matter
over with Mr. Jekyll, the "Primitive" minister, and the ploughman
told old Hugh and afterwards the vicar of Siddermorton.</p>

<p>"They are not an imaginative race about here," said the Vicar of
Siddermorton, "I wonder how much of that was true. Barring that he
thinks the wings were brown it sounds uncommonly like a
Flamingo."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap03"></a>THE HUNTING OF THE STRANGE BIRD</h2>

<h3>&sect; III</h3>

<p class="first">THE Vicar of Siddermorton (which is nine miles
inland from Siddermouth as the crow flies) was an ornithologist.
Some such pursuit, botany, antiquity, folk-lore, is almost
inevitable for a single man in his position. He was given to
geometry also, propounding occasionally impossible problems in the
Educational Times, but ornithology was his forte. He had already
added two visitors to the list of occasional British birds. His
name was well-known in the columns of the Zoologist (I am afraid it
may be forgotten by now, for the world moves apace). And on the day
after the coming of the Strange Bird, came first one and then
another to confirm the ploughman's story and tell him, not that it
had any connection, of the Glare upon Sidderford moor.</p>

<p>Now, the Vicar of Siddermorton had two rivals in his scientific
pursuits; Gully of Sidderton, who had actually seen the glare, and
who it was sent the drawing to Nature, and Borland the natural
history dealer, who kept the marine laboratory at Portburdock.
Borland, the Vicar thought, should have stuck to his copepods, but
instead he kept a taxidermist, and took advantage of his littoral
position to pick up rare sea birds. It was evident to anyone who
knew anything of collecting that both these men would be scouring
the country after the strange visitant, before twenty-four hours
were out.</p>

<p>The Vicar's eye rested on the back of Saunders' British Birds,
for he was in his study at the time. Already in two places there
was entered: "the only known British specimen was secured by the
Rev. K. Hilyer, Vicar of Siddermorton." A third such entry. He
doubted if any other collector had that.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch&mdash;two. He had just lunched, and
usually he "rested" in the afternoon. He knew it would make him
feel very disagreeable if he went out into the hot sunshine-both on
the top of his head and generally.</p>

<p>Yet Gully perhaps was out, prowling observant. Suppose it was
something very good and Gully got it!</p>

<p>His gun stood in the corner. (The thing had iridiscent wings and
pink legs! The chromatic conflict was certainly exceedingly
stimulating). He took his gun.</p>

<p>He would have gone out by the glass doors and verandah, and down
the garden into the hill road, in order to avoid his housekeeper's
eye. He knew his gun expeditions were not approved of. But
advancing towards him up the garden, he saw the curate's wife and
her two daughters, carrying tennis rackets. His curate's wife was a
young woman of immense will, who used to play tennis on his lawn,
and cut his roses, differ from him on doctrinal points, and
criticise his personal behaviour all over the parish. He went in
abject fear of her, was always trying to propitiate her. But so far
he had clung to his ornithology...</p>

<p>However, he went out by the front door.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IV</h3>

<p class="first">If it were not for collectors England would be
full, so to speak, of rare birds and wonderful butterflies, strange
flowers and a thousand interesting things. But happily the
collector prevents all that, either killing with his own hands or,
by buying extravagantly, procuring people of the lower classes to
kill such eccentricities as appear. It makes work for people, even
though Acts of Parliament interfere. In this way, for instance, he
is killing off the chough in Cornwall, the Bath white butterfly,
the Queen of Spain Fritillary; and can plume himself upon the
extermination of the Great Auk, and a hundred other rare birds and
plants and insects. All that is the work of the collector and his
glory alone. In the name of Science. And this is right and as it
should be; eccentricity, in fact, is immorality&mdash;think over it
again if you do not think so now&mdash;just as eccentricity in
one's way of thinking is madness (I defy you to find another
definition that will fit all the cases of either); and if a species
is rare it follows that it is not Fitted to Survive. The collector
is after all merely like the foot soldier in the days of heavy
armour-he leaves the combatants alone and cuts the throats of those
who are overthrown. So one may go through England from end to end
in the summer time and see only eight or ten commonplace wild
flowers, and the commoner butterflies, and a dozen or so common
birds, and never be offended by any breach of the monotony, any
splash of strange blossom or flutter of unknown wing. All the rest
have been "collected" years ago. For which cause we should all love
Collectors, and bear in mind what we owe them when their little
collections are displayed. These camphorated little drawers of
theirs, their glass cases and blotting-paper books, are the graves
of the Rare and the Beautiful, the symbols of the Triumph of
Leisure (morally spent) over the Delights of Life. (All of which,
as you very properly remark, has nothing whatever to do with the
Strange Bird.)</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; V</h3>

<p class="first">There is a place on the moor where the black water
shines among the succulent moss, and the hairy sundew, eater of
careless insects, spreads its red-stained hungry hands to the God
who gives his creatures&mdash;one to feed another. On a ridge
thereby grow birches with a silvery bark, and the soft green of the
larch mingles with the dark green fir. Thither through the honey
humming heather came the Vicar, in the heat of the day, carrying a
gun under his arm, a gun loaded with swanshot for the Strange Bird.
And over his disengaged hand he carried a pocket handkerchief
wherewith, ever and again, he wiped his beady face.</p>

<p>He went by and on past the big pond and the pool full of brown
leaves where the Sidder arises, and so by the road (which is at
first sandy and then chalky) to the little gate that goes into the
park. There are seven steps up to the gate and on the further side
six down again-lest the deer escape-so that when the Vicar stood in
the gateway his head was ten feet or more above the ground. And
looking where a tumult of bracken fronds filled the hollow between
two groups of beech, his eye caught something parti-coloured that
wavered and went. Suddenly his face gleamed and his muscles grew
tense; he ducked his head, clutched his gun with both hands, and
stood still. Then watching keenly, he came on down the steps into
the park, and still holding his gun with both hands, crept rather
than walked towards the jungle of bracken. Nothing stirred, and he
almost feared that his eyes had played him false, until he reached
the ferns and had gone rustling breast high into them. Then
suddenly rose something full of wavering colours, twenty yards or
less in front of his face, and beating the air. In another moment
it had fluttered above the bracken and spread its pinions wide. He
saw what it was, his heart was in his mouth, and he fired out of
pure surprise and habit.</p>

<p>There was a scream of superhuman agony, the wings beat the air
twice, and the victim came slanting swiftly downward and struck the
ground&mdash;a struggling heap of writhing body, broken wing and
flying bloodstained plumes&mdash;upon the turfy slope behind.</p>

<p>The Vicar stood aghast, with his smoking gun in his hand. It was
no bird at all, but a youth with an extremely beautiful face, clad
in a robe of saffron and with iridescent wings, across whose
pinions great waves of colour, flushes of purple and crimson,
golden green and intense blue, pursued one another as he writhed in
his agony. Never had the Vicar seen such gorgeous floods of colour,
not stained glass windows, not the wings of butterflies, not even
the glories of crystals seen between prisms, no colours on earth
could compare with them. Twice the Angel raised himself, only to
fall over sideways again. Then the beating of the wings diminished,
the terrified face grew pale, the floods of colour abated, and
suddenly with a sob he lay prone, and the changing hues of the
broken wings faded swiftly into one uniform dull grey hue.</p>

<p>"Oh! what has happened to me?" cried the Angel (for such it
was), shuddering violently, hands outstretched and clutching the
ground, and then lying still.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said the Vicar. "I had no idea." He came forward
cautiously. "Excuse me," he said, "I am afraid I have shot you." It
was the obvious remark.</p>

<p>The Angel seemed to become aware of his presence for the first
time. He raised himself by one hand, his brown eyes stared into the
Vicar's. Then, with a gasp, and biting his nether lip, he struggled
into a sitting position and surveyed the Vicar from top to toe.</p>

<p>"A man!" said the Angel, clasping his forehead; "a man in the
maddest black clothes and without a feather upon him. Then I was
not deceived. I am indeed in the Land of Dreams!"</p><br>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap04"></a>THE VICAR AND THE ANGEL</h2>

<h3>&sect; VI</h3>

<p class="first">
NOW there are some things frankly impossible. The weakest
intellect will admit this situation is impossible. The Athenaeum
will probably say as much should it venture to review this.
Sun-bespattered ferns, spreading beech trees, the Vicar and the gun
are acceptable enough. But this Angel is a different matter. Plain
sensible people will scarcely go on with such an extravagant book.
And the Vicar fully appreciated this impossibility. But he lacked
decision. Consequently he went on with it, as you shall immediately
hear. He was hot, it was after dinner, he was in no mood for mental
subtleties. The Angel had him at a disadvantage, and further
distracted him from the main issue by irrelevant iridescence and a
violent fluttering. For the moment it never occurred to the Vicar
to ask whether the Angel was possible or not. He accepted him in
the confusion of the moment, and the mischief was done. Put
yourself in his place, my dear Athenaeum. You go out shooting. You
hit something. That alone would disconcert you. You find you have
hit an Angel, and he writhes about for a minute and then sits up
and addresses you. He makes no apology for his own impossibility.
Indeed, he carries the charge clean into your camp. "A man!" he
says, pointing. "A man in the maddest black clothes and without a
feather upon him. Then I was not deceived. I am indeed in the Land
of Dreams!" You must answer him. Unless you take to your heels. Or
blow his brains out with your second barrel as an escape from the
controversy.</p>

<p>"The Land of Dreams! Pardon me if I suggest you have just come
out of it," was the Vicar's remark.</p>

<p>"How can that be?" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Your wing," said the Vicar, "is bleeding. Before we talk, may I
have the pleasure&mdash;the melancholy pleasure&mdash;of tying it
up? I am really most sincerely sorry..." The Angel put his hand
behind his back and winced.</p>

<p>The Vicar assisted his victim to stand up. The Angel turned
gravely and the Vicar, with numberless insignificant panting
parentheses, carefully examined the injured wings. (They
articulated, he observed with interest, to a kind of second glenoid
on the outer and upper edge of the shoulder blade. The left wing
had suffered little except the loss of some of the primary
wing-quills, and a shot or so in the ala spuria, but the humerus
bone of the right was evidently smashed.) The Vicar stanched the
bleeding as well as he could and tied up the bone with his pocket
handkerchief and the neck wrap his housekeeper made him carry in
all weathers.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you will not be able to fly for some time," said he,
feeling the bone.</p>

<p>"I don't like this new sensation," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"The Pain when I feel your bone?"</p>

<p>"The what?" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"The Pain."</p>

<p>"'Pain'&mdash;you call it. No, I certainly don't like the Pain.
Do you have much of this Pain in the Land of Dreams?"</p>

<p>"A very fair share," said the Vicar. "Is it new to you?"</p>

<p>"Quite," said the Angel. "I don't like it."</p>

<p>"How curious!" said the Vicar, and bit at the end of a strip of
linen to tie a knot. "I think this bandaging must serve for the
present," he said. "I've studied ambulance work before, but never
the bandaging up of wing wounds. Is your Pain any better?"</p>

<p>"It glows now instead of flashing," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will find it glow for some time," said the
Vicar, still intent on the wound.</p>

<p>The Angel gave a shrug of the wing and turned round to look at
the Vicar again. He had been trying to keep an eye on the Vicar
over his shoulder during all their interview. He looked at him from
top to toe with raised eyebrows and a growing smile on his
beautiful soft-featured face. "It seems so odd," he said with a
sweet little laugh, "to be talking to a Man!"</p>

<p>"Do you know," said the Vicar, "now that I come to think of it,
it is equally odd to me that I should be talking to an Angel. I am
a somewhat matter-of-fact person. A Vicar has to be. Angels I have
always regarded as&mdash;artistic conceptions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly what we think of men."</p>

<p>"But surely you have seen so many men&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never before to-day. In pictures and books, times enough of
course. But I have seen several since the sunrise, solid real men,
besides a horse or so those Unicorn things you know, without horns
and quite a number of those grotesque knobby things called 'cows.'
I was naturally a little frightened at so many mythical monsters,
and came to hide here until it was dark. I suppose it will be dark
again presently like it was at first. Phew! This Pain of yours is
poor fun. I hope I shall wake up directly."</p>

<p>"I don't understand quite," said the Vicar, knitting his brows
and tapping his forehead with his flat hand. "Mythical monster!"
The worst thing he had been called for years hitherto was a
'mediaeval anachronism' (by an advocate of Disestablishment). "Do I
understand that you consider me as&mdash;as something in a
dream?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said the Angel smiling.</p>

<p>"And this world about me, these rugged trees and spreading
fronds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is all so very dream-like," said the Angel. "Just exactly what
one dreams of&mdash;or artists imagine."</p>

<p>"You have artists then among the Angels?"</p>

<p>"All kinds of artists, Angels with wonderful imaginations, who
invent men and cows and eagles and a thousand impossible
creatures."</p>

<p>"Impossible creatures!" said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Impossible creatures," said the Angel. "Myths."</p>

<p>"But I'm real!" said the Vicar. "I assure you I'm real."</p>

<p>The Angel shrugged his wings and winced and smiled. "I can
always tell when I am dreaming," he said.</p>

<p>"You dreaming," said the Vicar. He looked round him.</p>

<p>"You dreaming!" he repeated. His mind worked diffusely.</p>

<p>He held out his hand with all his fingers moving. "I have it!"
he said. "I begin to see." A really brilliant idea was dawning upon
his mind. He had not studied mathematics at Cambridge for nothing,
after all. "Tell me, please. Some animals of your world...of the
Real World, real animals you know."</p>

<p>"Real animals!" said the Angel smiling. "Why&mdash;there's
Griffins and Dragons&mdash;and Jabberwocks and Cherubim&mdash;and
Sphinxes-and the Hippogriff&mdash;and Mermaids&mdash;and
Satyrs&mdash;and..."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the Vicar as the Angel appeared to be warming
to his work; "thank you. That is quite enough. I begin to
understand."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, his face pursed up. "Yes...I begin to
see it."</p>

<p>"See what?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"The Griffins and Satyrs and so forth. It's as clear..."</p>

<p>"I don't see them," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"No, the whole point is they are not to be seen in this world.
But our men with imaginations have told us all about them, you
know. And even I at times...there are places in this village where
you must simply take what they set before you, or give
offence&mdash;I, I say, have seen in my dreams Jabberwocks, Bogle
brutes, Mandrakes...From our point of view, you know, they are
Dream Creatures..."</p>

<p>"Dream Creatures!" said the Angel. "How singular! This is a very
curious dream. A kind of topsy-turvy one. You call men real and
angels a myth. It almost makes one think that in some odd way there
must be two worlds as it were..."</p>

<p>"At least Two," said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Lying somewhere close together, and yet scarcely
suspecting..."</p>

<p>"As near as page to page of a book."</p>

<p>"Penetrating each other, living each its own life. This is
really a delicious dream!"</p>

<p>"And never dreaming of each other."</p>

<p>"Except when people go a dreaming!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Angel thoughtfully. "It must be something of the
sort. And that reminds me. Sometimes when I have been dropping
asleep, or drowsing under the noon-tide sun, I have seen strange
corrugated faces just like yours, going by me, and trees with green
leaves upon them, and such queer uneven ground as this...It must be
so. I have fallen into another world."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," began the Vicar, "at bedtime, when I have been just
on the edge of consciousness, I have seen faces as beautiful as
yours, and the strange dazzling vistas of a wonderful scene, that
flowed past me, winged shapes soaring over it, and
wonderful&mdash;sometimes terrible&mdash;forms going to and fro. I
have even heard sweet music too in my ears...It may be that as we
withdraw our attention from the world of sense, the pressing world
about us, as we pass into the twilight of repose, other
worlds...Just as we see the stars, those other worlds in space,
when the glare of day recedes...And the artistic dreamers who see
such things most clearly..."</p>

<p>They looked at one another.</p>

<p>"And in some incomprehensible manner I have fallen into this
world of yours out of my own!" said the Angel, "into the world of
my dreams, grown real."</p>

<p>He looked about him. "Into the world of my dreams."</p>

<p>"It is confusing," said the Vicar. "It almost makes one think
there may be (ahem) Four Dimensions after all. In which case, of
course," (he went on hurriedly for he loved geometrical
speculations and took a certain pride in his knowledge of them)
"there may be any number of three dimensional universes packed side
by side, and all dimly dreaming of one another. There may be world
upon world, universe upon universe. It's perfectly possible.
There's nothing so incredible as the absolutely possible. But I
wonder how you came to fall out of your world into mine..."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said the Angel; "there's deer and a stag! Just as
they draw them on the coats of arms. How grotesque it all seems!
Can I really be awake?"</p>

<p>He rubbed his knuckles into his eyes.</p>

<p>The half-dozen of dappled deer came in Indian file obliquely
through the trees and halted, watching. "It's no dream&mdash;I am
really a solid concrete Angel, in Dream Land," said the Angel. He
laughed. The Vicar stood surveying him. The Reverend gentleman was
pulling his mouth askew after a habit he had, and slowly stroking
his chin. He was asking himself whether he too was not in the Land
of Dreams.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VII</h3>

<p class="first">Now in the land of the Angels, so the Vicar learnt
in the course of many conversations, there is neither pain nor
trouble nor death, marrying nor giving in marriage, birth nor
forgetting. Only at times new things begin. It is a land without
hill or dale, a wonderfully level land, glittering with strange
buildings, with incessant sunlight or full moon, and with incessant
breezes blowing through the Aeolian traceries of the trees. It is
Wonderland, with glittering seas hanging in the sky, across which
strange fleets go sailing, none know whither. There the flowers
glow in Heaven and the stars shine about one's feet and the breath
of life is a delight. The land goes on for ever-there is no solar
system nor interstellar space such as there is in our
universe&mdash;and the air goes upward past the sun into the
uttermost abyss of their sky. And there is nothing but Beauty
there&mdash;all the beauty in our art is but feeble rendering of
faint glimpses of that wonderful world, and our composers, our
original composers, are those who hear, however faintly, the dust
of melody that drives before its winds. And the Angels, and
wonderful monsters of bronze and marble and living fire, go to and
fro therein.</p>

<p>It is a land of Law&mdash;for whatever is, is under the law but
its laws all, in some strange way, differ from ours. Their geometry
is different because their space has a curve in it so that all
their planes are cylinders; and their law of Gravitation is not
according to the law of inverse squares, and there are
four-and-twenty primary colours instead of only three. Most of the
fantastic things of our science are common-places there, and all
our earthly science would seem to them the maddest dreaming. There
are no flowers upon their plants, for instance, but jets of
coloured fire. That, of course, would seem mere nonsense to you
because you do not understand. Most of what the Angel told the
Vicar, indeed, the Vicar could not realise, because his own
experiences, being only of this world of matter, warred against his
understanding. It was too strange to imagine.</p>

<p>What had jolted these twin universes together so that the Angel
had fallen suddenly into Sidderford, neither the Angel nor the
Vicar could tell. Nor for the matter of that could the author of
this story. The author is concerned with the facts of the case, and
has neither the desire nor the confidence to explain them.
Explanations are the fallacy of a scientific age. And the cardinal
fact of the case is this, that out in Siddermorton Park, with the
glory of some wonderful world where there is neither sorrow nor
sighing, still clinging to him, on the 4th of August, 1895, stood
an Angel, bright and beautiful, talking to the Vicar of
Siddermorton about the plurality of worlds. The author will swear
to the Angel, if need be; and there he draws the line.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VIII</h3>

<p class="first">"I have," said the Angel, "a most unusual feeling
here. Have had since sunrise. I don't remember ever having any
feeling here before."</p>

<p>"Not pain, I hope," said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Oh no! It is quite different from that a kind of vacuous
feeling."</p>

<p>"The atmospheric pressure, perhaps, is a little different," the
Vicar began, feeling his chin.</p>

<p>"And do you know, I have also the most curious sensations in my
mouth almost as if it's so absurd! as if I wanted to stuff things
into it."</p>

<p>"Bless me!" said the Vicar. "Of course! You're hungry!"</p>

<p>"Hungry!" said the Angel. "What's that?"</p>

<p>"Don't you eat?"</p>

<p>"Eat! The word's quite new to me."</p>

<p>"Put food into your mouth, you know. One has to here. You will
soon learn. If you don't, you get thin and miserable, and suffer a
great deal pain, you know and finally you die."</p>

<p>"Die!" said the Angel. "That's another strange word!"</p>

<p>"It's not strange here. It means leaving off, you know," said
the Vicar.</p>

<p>"We never leave off," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"You don't know what may happen to you in this world," said the
Vicar, thinking him over. "Possibly if you are feeling hungry, and
can feel pain and have your wings broken, you may even have to die
before you get out of it again. At any rate you had better try
eating. For my own part (ahem)! there are many more disagreeable
things."</p>

<p>"I suppose I had better Eat," said the Angel. "If it's not too
difficult. I don't like this 'Pain' of yours, and I don't like this
'Hungry.' If your 'Die' is anything like it, I would prefer to Eat.
What a very odd world this is!"</p>

<p>"To Die," said the Vicar, "is generally considered worse than
either pain or hunger...It depends."</p>

<p>"You must explain all that to me later," said the Angel. "Unless
I wake up. At present, please show me how to eat. If you will. I
feel a kind of urgency..."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said the Vicar, and offered an elbow. "If I may
have the pleasure of entertaining you. My house lies yonder not a
couple of miles from here."</p>

<p>"Your House!" said the Angel a little puzzled; but he took the
Vicar's arm affectionately, and the two, conversing as they went,
waded slowly through the luxuriant bracken, sun-mottled under the
trees, and on over the stile in the park palings, and so across the
bee-swarming heather for a mile or more, down the hillside,
home.</p>

<p>You would have been charmed at the couple could you have seen
them. The Angel, slight of figure, scarcely five feet high, and
with a beautiful, almost effeminate face, such as an Italian old
Master might have painted. (Indeed, there is one in the National
Gallery [Tobias and the Angel, by some artist unknown] not at all
unlike him so far as face and spirit go.) He was robed simply in a
purple-wrought saffron blouse, bare-kneed and bare-footed, with his
wings (broken now, and a leaden grey) folded behind him. The Vicar
was a short, rather stout figure, rubicund, red-haired,
clean-shaven, and with bright ruddy brown eyes. He wore a piebald
straw hat with a black ribbon, a very neat white tie, and a fine
gold watch-chain. He was so greatly interested in his companion
that it only occurred to him when he was in sight of the Vicarage
that he had left his gun lying just where he had dropped it amongst
the bracken.</p>

<p>He was rejoiced to hear that the pain of the bandaged wing fell
rapidly in intensity.</p>

<h2><a id="chap05"></a>PARENTHESIS ON ANGELS</h2>

<h3>&sect; IX</h3>

<p class="first">LET us be plain. The Angel of this story is the
Angel of Art, not the Angel that one must be irreverent to
touch&mdash;neither the Angel of religious feeling nor the Angel of
popular belief. The last we all know. She is alone among the
angelic hosts in being distinctly feminine: she wears a robe of
immaculate, unmitigated white with sleeves, is fair, with long
golden tresses, and has eyes of the blue of Heaven. Just a pure
woman she is, pure maiden or pure matron, in her robe de nuit, and
with wings attached to her shoulder blades. Her callings are
domestic and sympathetic, she watches over a cradle or assists a
sister soul heavenward. Often she bears a palm leaf, but one would
not be surprised if one met her carrying a warming-pan softly to
some poor chilly sinner. She it was who came down in a bevy to
Marguerite in prison, in the amended last scene in Faust at the
Lyceum, and the interesting and improving little children that are
to die young, have visions of such angels in the novels of Mrs
Henry Wood. This white womanliness with her indescribable charm of
lavender-like holiness, her aroma of clean, methodical lives, is,
it would seem after all, a purely Teutonic invention. Latin thought
knows her not; the old masters have none of her. She is of a piece
with that gentle innocent ladylike school of art whereof the
greatest triumph is "a lump in one's throat," and where wit and
passion, scorn and pomp, have no place. The white angel was made in
Germany, in the land of blonde women and the domestic sentiments.
She comes to us cool and worshipful, pure and tranquil, as silently
soothing as the breadth and calmness of the starlit sky, which also
is so unspeakably dear to the Teutonic soul...We do her reverence.
And to the angels of the Hebrews, those spirits of power and
mystery, to Raphael, Zadkiel, and Michael, of whom only Watts has
caught the shadow, of whom only Blake has seen the splendour, to
them too, do we do reverence.</p>

<p>But this Angel the Vicar shot is, we say, no such angel at all,
but the Angel of Italian art, polychromatic and gay. He comes from
the land of beautiful dreams and not from any holier place. At best
he is a popish creature. Bear patiently, therefore, with his
scattered remiges, and be not hasty with your charge of irreverence
before the story is read.</p>

<h2><a id="chap06"></a>AT THE VICARAGE</h2>

<h3>&sect; X</h3>

<p class="first">THE Curate's wife and her two daughters and Mrs.
Jehoram were still playing at tennis on the lawn behind the Vicar's
study, playing keenly and talking in gasps about paper patterns for
blouses. But the Vicar forgot and came in that way.</p>

<p>They saw the Vicar's hat above the rhododendrons, and a bare
curly head beside him. "I must ask him about Susan Wiggin," said
the Curate's wife. She was about to serve, and stood with a racket
in one hand and a ball between the fingers of the other. "He really
ought to have gone to see her being the Vicar. Not George.
I&mdash;Ah!"</p>

<p>For the two figures suddenly turned the corner and were visible.
The Vicar, arm in arm with&mdash;</p>

<p>You see, it came on the Curate's wife suddenly. The Angel's face
being towards her she saw nothing of the wings. Only a face of
unearthly beauty in a halo of chestnut hair, and a graceful figure
clothed in a saffron garment that barely reached the knees. The
thought of those knees flashed upon the Vicar at once. He too was
horrorstruck. So were the two girls and Mrs. Jehoram. All
horrorstruck. The Angel stared in astonishment at the horrorstruck
group. You see, he had never seen anyone horrorstruck before.</p>

<p>"Mis-ter Hilyer!" said the Curate's wife. "This is too much!"
She stood speechless for a moment. "Oh!"</p>

<p>She swept round upon the rigid girls. "Come!" The Vicar opened
and shut his voiceless mouth. The world hummed and spun about him.
There was a whirling of zephyr skirts, four impassioned faces
sweeping towards the open door of the passage that ran through the
vicarage. He felt his position went with them.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mendham," said the Vicar, stepping forward. "Mrs. Mendham.
You don't understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" they all said again.</p>

<p>One, two, three, four skirts vanished in the doorway. The Vicar
staggered half way across the lawn and stopped, aghast. "This
comes," he heard the Curate's wife say, out of the depth of the
passage, "of having an unmarried vicar&mdash;" The umbrella stand
wobbled. The front door of the vicarage slammed like a minute gun.
There was silence for a space.</p>

<p>"I might have thought," he said. "She is always so hasty."</p>

<p>He put his hand to his chin&mdash;a habit with him. Then turned
his face to his companion. The Angel was evidently well bred. He
was holding up Mrs. Jehoram's sunshade&mdash;she had left it on one
of the cane chairs&mdash;and examining it with extraordinary
interest. He opened it. "What a curious little mechanism!" he said.
"What can it be for?"</p>

<p>The Vicar did not answer. The angelic costume certainly
was&mdash;the Vicar knew it was a case for a French
phrase&mdash;but he could scarcely remember it. He so rarely used
French. It was not de trop, he knew. Anything but de trop. The
Angel was de trop, but certainly not his costume. Ah! Sans
culotte!</p>

<p>The Vicar examined his visitor critically for the first time.
"He will be difficult to explain," he said to himself softly.</p>

<p>The Angel stuck the sunshade into the turf and went to smell the
sweet briar. The sunshine fell upon his brown hair and gave it
almost the appearance of a halo. He pricked his finger. "Odd!" he
said. "Pain again."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Vicar, thinking aloud. "He's very beautiful and
curious as he is. I should like him best so. But I am afraid I
must."</p>

<p>He approached the Angel with a nervous cough.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XI</h3>

<p class="first">"Those," said the Vicar, "were ladies."</p>

<p>"How grotesque," said the Angel, smiling and smelling the sweet
briar. "And such quaint shapes!"</p>

<p>"Possibly," said the Vicar. "Did you, ahem, notice how they
behaved?"</p>

<p>"They went away. Seemed, indeed, to run away. Frightened? I, of
course, was frightened at things without wings. I hope&mdash;they
were not frightened at my wings?"</p>

<p>"At your appearance generally," said the Vicar, glancing
involuntarily at the pink feet.</p>

<p>"Dear me! It never occurred to me. I suppose I seemed as odd to
them as you did to me." He glanced down. "And my feet. You have
hoofs like a hippogriff."</p>

<p>"Boots," corrected the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Boots, you call them! But anyhow, I am sorry I
alarmed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You see," said the Vicar, stroking his chin, "our ladies, ahem,
have peculiar views&mdash;rather inartistic views&mdash;about,
ahem, clothing. Dressed as you are, I am afraid, I am really afraid
that&mdash;beautiful as your costume certainly is&mdash;you will
find yourself somewhat, ahem, somewhat isolated in society. We have
a little proverb, 'When in Rome, ahem, one must do as the Romans
do.' I can assure you that, assuming you are desirous to, ahem,
associate with us&mdash;during your involuntary stay&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Angel retreated a step or so as the Vicar came nearer and
nearer in his attempt to be diplomatic and confidential. The
beautiful face grew perplexed. "I don't quite understand. Why do
you keep making these noises in your throat? Is it Die or Eat, or
any of those..."</p>

<p>"As your host," interrupted the Vicar, and stopped.</p>

<p>"As my host," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Would you object, pending more permanent arrangements, to
invest yourself, ahem, in a suit, an entirely new suit I may say,
like this I have on?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the Angel. He retreated so as to take in the Vicar
from top to toe. "Wear clothes like yours!" he said. He was puzzled
but amused. His eyes grew round and bright, his mouth puckered at
the corners.</p>

<p>"Delightful!" he said, clapping his hands together. "What a mad,
quaint dream this is! Where are they?" He caught at the neck of the
saffron robe.</p>

<p>"Indoors!" said the Vicar. "This way. We will
change-indoors!"</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XII</h3>

<p class="first">So the Angel was invested in a pair of nether
garments of the Vicar's, a shirt, ripped down the back (to
accommodate the wings), socks, shoes&mdash;the Vicar's dress
shoes&mdash;collar, tie, and light overcoat. But putting on the
latter was painful, and reminded the Vicar that the bandaging was
temporary. "I will ring for tea at once, and send Grummet down for
Crump," said the Vicar. "And dinner shall be earlier." While the
Vicar shouted his orders on the landing rails, the Angel surveyed
himself in the cheval glass with immense delight. If he was a
stranger to pain, he was evidently no stranger&mdash;thanks perhaps
to dreaming&mdash;to the pleasure of incongruity.</p>

<p>They had tea in the drawing-room. The Angel sat on the music
stool (music stool because of his wings). At first he wanted to lie
on the hearthrug. He looked much less radiant in the Vicar's
clothes, than he had done upon the moor when dressed in saffron.
His face shone still, the colour of his hair and cheeks was
strangely bright, and there was a superhuman light in his eyes, but
his wings under the overcoat gave him the appearance of a
hunchback. The garments, indeed, made quite a terrestrial thing of
him; the trousers were puckered transversely, and the shoes a size
or so too large.</p>

<p>He was charmingly affable and quite ignorant of the most
elementary facts of civilisation. Eating came without much
difficulty, and the Vicar had an entertaining time teaching him how
to take tea. "What a mess it is! What a dear grotesque ugly world
you live in!" said the Angel. "Fancy stuffing things into your
mouth! We use our mouths just to talk and sing with. Our world, you
know, is almost incurably beautiful. We get so very little
ugliness, that I find all this...delightful."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hinijer, the Vicar's housekeeper, looked at the Angel
suspiciously when she brought in the tea. She thought him rather a
"queer customer." What she would have thought had she seen him in
saffron no one can tell.</p>

<p>The Angel shuffled about the room with his cup of tea in one
hand, and the bread and butter in the other, and examined the
Vicar's furniture. Outside the French windows the lawn, with its
array of dahlias and sunflowers, glowed in the warm sunlight, and
Mrs. Jehoram's sunshade stood thereon like a triangle of fire. He
thought the Vicar's portrait over the mantel very curious indeed,
could not understand what it was there for. "You have yourself
round," he said, apropos of the portrait, "Why want yourself flat?"
and he was vastly amused at the glass fire screen. He found the oak
chairs odd&mdash;"You're not square, are you?" he said, when the
Vicar explained their use. "We never double ourselves up. We lie
about on the asphodel when we want to rest."</p>

<p>"The chair," said the Vicar, "to tell you the truth, has always
puzzled me. It dates, I think, from the days when the floors were
cold and very dirty. I suppose we have kept up the habit. It's
become a kind of instinct with us to sit on chairs. Anyhow, if I
went to see one of my parishioners, and suddenly spread myself out
on the floor&mdash;the natural way of it&mdash;I don't know what
she would do. It would be all over the parish in no time. Yet it
seems the natural method of reposing, to recline. The Greeks and
Romans&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is this?" said the Angel abruptly.</p>

<p>"That's a stuffed kingfisher. I killed it."</p>

<p>"Killed it!"</p>

<p>"Shot it," said the Vicar, "with a gun."</p>

<p>"Shot! As you did me?"</p>

<p>"I didn't kill you, you see. Fortunately."</p>

<p>"Is killing making like that?"</p>

<p>"In a way."</p>

<p>"Dear me! And you wanted to make me like that&mdash;wanted to
put glass eyes in me and string me up in a glass case full of ugly
green and brown stuff?"</p>

<p>"You see," began the Vicar, "I scarcely understood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that 'die'?" asked the Angel suddenly.</p>

<p>"That is dead; it died."</p>

<p>"Poor little thing. I must eat a lot. But you say you killed it.
Why?"</p>

<p>"You see," said the Vicar, "I take an interest in birds, and I
(ahem) collect them. I wanted the specimen&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Angel stared at him for a moment with puzzled eyes. "A
beautiful bird like that!" he said with a shiver. "Because the
fancy took you. You wanted the specimen!"</p>

<p>He thought for a minute. "Do you often kill?" he asked the
Vicar.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap07"></a>THE MAN OF SCIENCE</h2>

<h3>&sect; XIII</h3>

<p class="first">THEN Doctor Crump arrived. Grummet had met him not
a hundred yards from the vicarage gate. He was a large, rather
heavy-looking man, with a clean-shaven face and a double chin. He
was dressed in a grey morning coat (he always affected grey), with
a chequered black and white tie. "What's the trouble?" he said,
entering and staring without a shadow of surprise at the Angel's
radiant face.</p>

<p>"This&mdash;ahem&mdash;gentleman," said the Vicar,
"or&mdash;ah&mdash;Angel"&mdash;the Angel bowed&mdash;"is suffering
from a gunshot wound."</p>

<p>"Gunshot wound!" said Doctor Crump. "In July! May I look at it,
Mr. Angel, I think you said?"</p>

<p>"He will probably be able to assuage your pain," said the Vicar.
"Let me assist you to remove your coat?"</p>

<p>The Angel turned obediently.</p>

<p>"Spinal curvature?" muttered Doctor Crump quite audibly, walking
round behind the Angel. "No! abnormal growth. Hullo! This is odd!"
He clutched the left wing. "Curious," he said. "Reduplication of
the anterior limb&mdash;bifid coracoid. Possible, of course, but
I've never seen it before." The Angel winced under his hands.
"Humerus. Radius and Ulna. All there. Congenital, of course.
Humerus broken. Curious integumentary simulation of feathers. Dear
me. Almost avian. Probably of considerable interest in comparative
anatomy. I never did!&mdash;How did this gunshot happen, Mr.
Angel?"</p>

<p>The Vicar was amazed at the Doctor's matter-of-fact manner.</p>

<p>"Our friend," said the Angel, moving his head at the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Unhappily it is my doing," said the Vicar, stepping forward,
explanatory. "I mistook the gentleman&mdash;the
Angel&mdash;(ahem)&mdash;for a large bird&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mistook him for a large bird! What next? Your eyes want seeing
to," said Doctor Crump. "I've told you so before." He went on
patting and feeling, keeping time with a series of grunts and
inarticulate muttering..."But this is really a very good bit of
amateur bandaging," said he. "I think I shall leave it. Curious
malformation this is! Don't you find it inconvenient, Mr.
Angel?"</p>

<p>He suddenly walked round so as to look in the Angel's face.</p>

<p>The Angel thought he referred to the wound. "It is rather," he
said.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for the bones I should say paint with iodine night
and morning. Nothing like iodine. You could paint your face flat
with it. But the osseous outgrowth, the bones, you know, complicate
things. I could saw them off, of course. It's not a thing one
should have done in a hurry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean my wings?" said the Angel in alarm.</p>

<p>"Wings!" said the Doctor. "Eigh? Call 'em wings! Yes-what else
should I mean?"</p>

<p>"Saw them off!" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Don't you think so? It's of course your affair. I am only
advising&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Saw them off! What a funny creature you are!" said the Angel,
beginning to laugh.</p>

<p>"As you will," said the Doctor. He detested people who laughed.
"The things are curious," he said, turning to the Vicar. "If
inconvenient"&mdash;to the Angel. "I never heard of such complete
reduplication before&mdash;at least among animals. In plants it's
common enough. Were you the only one in your family?" He did not
wait for a reply. "Partial cases of the fission of limbs are not at
all uncommon, of course, Vicar&mdash;six-fingered children, calves
with six feet, and cats with double toes, you know. May I assist
you?" he said, turning to the Angel who was struggling with the
coat. "But such a complete reduplication, and so avian, too! It
would be much less remarkable if it was simply another pair of
arms."</p>

<p>The coat was got on and he and the Angel stared at one
another.</p>

<p>"Really," said the Doctor, "one begins to understand how that
beautiful myth of the angels arose. You look a little hectic, Mr.
Angel&mdash;feverish. Excessive brilliance is almost worse as a
symptom than excessive pallor. Curious your name should be Angel. I
must send you a cooling draught, if you should feel thirsty in the
night..."</p>

<p>He made a memorandum on his shirt cuff. The Angel watched him
thoughtfully, with the dawn of a smile in his eyes.</p>

<p>"One minute, Crump," said the Vicar, taking the Doctor's arm and
leading him towards the door.</p>

<p>The Angel's smile grew brighter. He looked down at his
black-clad legs. "He positively thinks I am a man!" said the Angel.
"What he makes of the wings beats me altogether. What a queer
creature he must be! This is really a most extraordinary
Dream!"</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XIV</h3>

<p class="first">"That is an Angel," whispered the Vicar. "You
don't understand."</p>

<p>"What?" said the Doctor in a quick, sharp voice. His eyebrows
went up and he smiled.</p>

<p>"But the wings?"</p>

<p>"Quite natural, quite...if a little abnormal."</p>

<p>"Are you sure they are natural?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, everything that is, is natural. There is
nothing unnatural in the world. If I thought there was I should
give up practice and go into Le Grand Chartreuse. There are
abnormal phenomena, of course. And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the way I came upon him," said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Yes, tell me where you picked him up," said the Doctor. He sat
down on the hall table.</p>

<p>The Vicar began rather hesitatingly&mdash;he was not very good
at story telling&mdash;with the rumours of a strange great bird. He
told the story in clumsy sentences&mdash;for, knowing the Bishop as
he did, with that awful example always before him he dreaded
getting his pulpit style into his daily conversation and at every
third sentence or so, the Doctor made a downward movement of his
head&mdash;the corners of his mouth tucked away, so to
speak&mdash;as though he ticked off the phases of the story and so
far found it just as it ought to be. "Self-hypnotism," he murmured
once.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?" said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the Doctor. "Nothing, I assure you. Go on. This
is extremely interesting."</p>

<p>The Vicar told him he went out with his gun.</p>

<p>"After lunch, I think you said?" interrupted the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Immediately after," said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"You should not do such things, you know. But go on,
please."</p>

<p>He came to the glimpse of the Angel from the gate.</p>

<p>"In the full glare," said the Doctor, in parenthesis. "It was
seventy-nine in the shade."</p>

<p>When the Vicar had finished, the Doctor pressed his lips
together tighter than ever, smiled faintly, and looked
significantly into the Vicar's eyes.</p>

<p>"You don't..." began the Vicar, falteringly.</p>

<p>The Doctor shook his head. "Forgive me," he said, putting his
hand on the Vicar's arm.</p>

<p>"You go out," he said, "on a hot lunch and on a hot afternoon.
Probably over eighty. Your mind, what there is of it, is whirling
with avian expectations. I say, 'what there is of it,' because most
of your nervous energy is down there, digesting your dinner. A man
who has been lying in the bracken stands up before you and you
blaze away. Over he goes&mdash;and as it happens&mdash;as it
happens&mdash;he has reduplicate fore-limbs, one pair being not
unlike wings. It's a coincidence certainly. And as for his
iridescent colours and so forth&mdash;. Have you never had patches
of colour swim before your eyes before, on a brilliant sunlight
day?...Are you sure they were confined to the wings? Think."</p>

<p>"But he says he is an Angel!" said the Vicar, staring out of his
little round eyes, his plump hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Doctor with his eye on the Vicar. "I expected as
much." He paused.</p>

<p>"But don't you think..." began the Vicar.</p>

<p>"That man," said the Doctor in a low, earnest voice, "is a
mattoid."</p>

<p>"A what?" said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"A mattoid. An abnormal man. Did you notice the effeminate
delicacy of his face? His tendency to quite unmeaning laughter? His
neglected hair? Then consider his singular dress..."</p>

<p>The Vicar's hand went up to his chin.</p>

<p>"Marks of mental weakness," said the Doctor. "Many of this type
of degenerate show this same disposition to assume some vast
mysterious credentials. One will call himself the Prince of Wales,
another the Archangel Gabriel, another the Deity even. Ibsen thinks
he is a Great Teacher, and Maeterlink a new Shakespeare. I've just
been reading all about it&mdash;in Nordau. No doubt his odd
deformity gave him an idea..."</p>

<p>"But really," began the Vicar.</p>

<p>"No doubt he's slipped away from confinement."</p>

<p>"I do not altogether accept..."</p>

<p>"You will. If not, there's the police, and failing that,
advertisement; but, of course, his people may want to hush it up.
It's a sad thing in a family..."</p>

<p>"He seems so altogether..."</p>

<p>"Probably you'll hear from his friends in a day or so," said the
Doctor, feeling for his watch. "He can't live far from here, I
should think. He seems harmless enough. I must come along and see
that wing again to-morrow." He slid off the hall table and stood
up.</p>

<p>"Those old wives' tales still have their hold on you," he said,
patting the Vicar on the shoulder. "But an angel, you know ha,
ha!"</p>

<p>"I certainly did think..." said the Vicar dubiously.</p>

<p>"Weigh the evidence," said the Doctor, still fumbling at his
watch. "Weigh the evidence with our instruments of precision. What
does it leave you? Splashes of colour, spots of fancy-muscce
volantes."</p>

<p>"And yet," said the Vicar, "I could almost swear to the glory on
his wings..."</p>

<p>"Think it over," said the Doctor (watch out); "hot
afternoon&mdash;brilliant sunshine&mdash;boiling down on your
head...But really I must be going. It is a quarter to five. I'll
see your angel (ha, ha!) to-morrow again, if no one has been to
fetch him in the meanwhile. Your bandaging was really very good. I
flatter myself on that score. Our ambulance classes were a success
you see...Good afternoon."</p>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap08"></a>THE CURATE</h2>

<h3>&sect; XV</h3>

<p class="first">THE Vicar opened the door half mechanically to let
out Crump, and saw Mendham, his curate, coming up the pathway by
the hedge of purple vetch and meadowsweet. At that his hand went up
to his chin and his eyes grew perplexed. Suppose he was deceived.
The Doctor passed the Curate with a sweep of his hand from his hat
brim. Crump was an extraordinarily clever fellow, the Vicar
thought, and knew far more of anyone's brain than one did oneself.
The Vicar felt that so acutely. It made the coming explanation
difficult. Suppose he were to go back into the drawing-room, and
find just a tramp asleep on the hearthrug.</p>

<p>Mendham was a cadaverous man with a magnificent beard. He
looked, indeed, as though he had run to beard as a mustard plant
does to seed. But when he spoke you found he had a voice as
well.</p>

<p>"My wife came home in a dreadful state," he brayed out at long
range.</p>

<p>"Come in," said the Vicar; "come in. Most remarkable occurrence.
Please come in. Come into the study. I'm really dreadfully sorry.
But when I explain..."</p>

<p>"And apologise, I hope," brayed the Curate.</p>

<p>"And apologise. No, not that way. This way. The study."</p>

<p>"Now what was that woman?" said the Curate, turning on the Vicar
as the latter closed the study door.</p>

<p>"What woman?"</p>

<p>"Pah!"</p>

<p>"But really!"</p>

<p>"The painted creature in light attire&mdash;disgustingly light
attire, to speak freely&mdash;with whom you were promenading the
garden."</p>

<p>"My dear Mendham that was an Angel!"</p>

<p>"A very pretty Angel?"</p>

<p>"The world is getting so matter-of-fact," said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"The world," roared the Curate, "grows blacker every day. But to
find a man in your position, shamelessly, openly..."</p>

<p>"Bother!" said the Vicar aside. He rarely swore. "Look here,
Mendham, you really misunderstand. I can assure you..."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Curate. "Explain!" He stood with his lank
legs apart, his arms folded, scowling at his Vicar over his big
beard.</p>

<p>(Explanations, I repeat, I have always considered the peculiar
fallacy of this scientific age.)</p>

<p>The Vicar looked about him helplessly. The world had all gone
dull and dead. Had he been dreaming all the afternoon? Was there
really an angel in the drawing-room? Or was he the sport of a
complicated hallucination?</p>

<p>"Well?" said Mendham, at the end of a minute.</p>

<p>The Vicar's hand fluttered about his chin. "It's such a
round-about story," he said.</p>

<p>"No doubt it will be," said Mendham harshly.</p>

<p>The Vicar restrained a movement of impatience.</p>

<p>"I went out to look for a strange bird this afternoon...Do you
believe in angels, Mendham, real angels?"</p>

<p>"I'm not here to discuss theology. I am the husband of an
insulted woman."</p>

<p>"But I tell you it's not a figure of speech; this is an angel, a
real angel with wings. He's in the next room now. You do
misunderstand me, so..."</p>

<p>"Really, Hilyer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is true I tell you, Mendham. I swear it is true." The
Vicar's voice grew impassioned. "What sin I have done that I should
entertain and clothe angelic visitants, I don't know. I only know
that&mdash;inconvenient as it undoubtedly will be&mdash;I have an
angel now in the drawing-room, wearing my new suit and finishing
his tea. And he's stopping with me, indefinitely, at my invitation.
No doubt it was rash of me. But I can't turn him out, you know,
because Mrs. Mendham&mdash;I may be a weakling, but I am still a
gentleman."</p>

<p>"Really, Hilyer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can assure you it is true." There was a note of hysterical
desperation in the Vicar's voice. "I fired at him, taking him for a
flamingo, and hit him in the wing."</p>

<p>"I thought this was a case for the Bishop. I find it is a case
for the Lunacy Commissioners."</p>

<p>"Come and see him, Mendham!"</p>

<p>"But there are no angels."</p>

<p>"We teach the people differently," said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Not as material bodies," said the Curate.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, come and see him."</p>

<p>"I don't want to see your hallucinations," began the Curate.</p>

<p>"I can't explain anything unless you come and see him," said the
Vicar. "A man who's more like an angel than anything else in heaven
or earth. You simply must see if you wish to understand."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to understand," said the Curate. "I don't wish to
lend myself to any imposture. Surely, Hilyer, if this is not an
imposition, you can tell me yourself...Flamingo, indeed!"</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XVI</h3>

<p class="first">The Angel had finished his tea and was standing
looking pensively out of the window. He thought the old church down
the valley lit by the light of the setting sun was very beautiful,
but he could not understand the serried ranks of tombstones that
lay up the hillside beyond. He turned as Mendham and the Vicar came
in.</p>

<p>Now Mendham could bully his Vicar cheerfully enough, just as he
could bully his congregation; but he was not the sort of man to
bully a stranger. He looked at the Angel, and the "strange woman"
theory was disposed of. The Angel's beauty was too clearly the
beauty of the youth.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hilyer tells me," Mendham began, in an almost apologetic
tone, "that you&mdash;ah&mdash;it's so curious&mdash;claim to be an
Angel."</p>

<p>"Are an Angel," said the Vicar.</p>

<p>The Angel bowed.</p>

<p>"Naturally," said Mendham, "we are curious."</p>

<p>"Very," said the Angel. "The blackness and the shape."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?" said Mendham.</p>

<p>"The blackness and the flaps," repeated the Angel; "and no
wings."</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Mendham, who was altogether at a loss. "We
are, of course, curious to know something of how you came into the
village in such a peculiar costume."</p>

<p>The Angel looked at the Vicar. The Vicar touched his chin.</p>

<p>"You see," began the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Let him explain," said Mendham; "I beg."</p>

<p>"I wanted to suggest," began the Vicar.</p>

<p>"And I don't want you to suggest."</p>

<p>"Bother!" said the Vicar.</p>

<p>The Angel looked from one to the other. "Such rugose expressions
flit across your faces!" he said.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;I don't know your name," said
Mendham, with a certain diminution of suavity. "The case stands
thus: My wife&mdash;four ladies, I might say&mdash;are playing lawn
tennis, when you suddenly rush out on them, sir; you rush out on
them from among the rhododendra in a very defective costume. You
and Mr. Hilyer."</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;" said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"I know. It was this gentleman's costume was defective.
Naturally it is my place in fact to demand an explanation." His
voice was growing in volume. "And I must demand an
explanation."</p>

<p>The Angel smiled faintly at his note of anger and his sudden
attitude of determination&mdash;arms tightly folded.</p>

<p>"I am rather new to the world," the Angel began.</p>

<p>"Nineteen at least," said Mendham. "Old enough to know better.
That's a poor excuse."</p>

<p>"May I ask one question first?" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Do you think I am a Man like yourself? As the chequered man
did."</p>

<p>"If you are not a man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One other question. Have you never heard of an Angel?"</p>

<p>"I warn you not to try that story upon me," said Mendham, now
back at his familiar crescendo.</p>

<p>The Vicar interrupted: "But Mendham&mdash;he has wings!"</p>

<p>"Please let me talk to him," said Mendham.</p>

<p>"You are so quaint," said the Angel; "you interrupt everything I
have to say."</p>

<p>"But what have you to say?" said Mendham.</p>

<p>"That I really am an Angel..."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!"</p>

<p>"There you go!"</p>

<p>"But tell me, honestly, how you came to be in the shrubbery of
Siddermorton Vicarage&mdash;in the state in which you were. And in
the Vicar's company. Cannot you abandon this ridiculous story of
yours?..."</p>

<p>The Angel shrugged his wings. "What is the matter with this
man?" he said to the Vicar.</p>

<p>"My dear Mendham," said the Vicar, "a few words from me..."</p>

<p>"Surely my question is straightforward enough!"</p>

<p>"But you won't tell me the answer you want, and it's no good my
telling you any other."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said the Curate again. And then turning suddenly on the
Vicar, "Where does he come from?"</p>

<p>The Vicar was in a dreadful state of doubt by this time.</p>

<p>"He says he is an Angel!" said the Vicar. "Why don't you listen
to him?"</p>

<p>"No angel would alarm four ladies..."</p>

<p>"Is that what it is all about?" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Enough cause too, I should think!" said the Curate.</p>

<p>"But I really did not know," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"This is altogether too much!"</p>

<p>"I am sincerely sorry I alarmed these ladies."</p>

<p>"You ought to be. But I see I shall get nothing out of you two."
Mendham went towards the door. "I am convinced there is something
discreditable at the bottom of this business. Or why not tell a
simple straightforward story? I will confess you puzzle me. Why, in
this enlightened age, you should tell this fantastic, this
far-fetched story of an Angel, altogether beats me. What good can
it do?..."</p>

<p>"But stop and look at his wings!" said the Vicar. "I can assure
you he has wings!"</p>

<p>Mendham had his fingers on the door-handle. "I have seen quite
enough," he said. "It may be this is simply a foolish attempt at a
hoax, Hilyer."</p>

<p>"But Mendham!" said the Vicar.</p>

<p>The Curate halted in the doorway and looked at the Vicar over
his shoulder. The accumulating judgment of months found vent. "I
cannot understand, Hilyer, why you are in the Church. For the life
of me I cannot. The air is full of Social Movements, of Economic
change, the Woman Movement, Rational Dress, The Reunion of
Christendom, Socialism, Individualism&mdash;all the great and
moving Questions of the Hour! Surely, we who follow the Great
Reformer...And here you are stuffing birds, and startling ladies
with your callous disregard..."</p>

<p>"But Mendham," began the Vicar.</p>

<p>The Curate would not hear him. "You shame the Apostles with your
levity... But this is only a preliminary enquiry," he said, with a
threatening note in his sonorous voice, and so vanished abruptly
(with a violent slam) from the room.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XVII</h3>

<p class="first">"Are all men so odd as this?" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"I'm in such a difficult position," said the Vicar. "You see,"
he said, and stopped, searching his chin for an idea.</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to see," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"They won't believe it."</p>

<p>"I see that."</p>

<p>"They will think I tell lies."</p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p>"That will be extremely painful to me."</p>

<p>"Painful!...Pain," said the Angel. "I hope not."</p>

<p>The Vicar shook his head. The good report of the village had
been the breath of his life, so far. "You see," he said, "it would
look so much more plausible if you said you were just a man."</p>

<p>"But I'm not," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"No, you're not," said the Vicar. "So that's no good."</p>

<p>"Nobody here, you know, has ever seen an Angel, or heard of one
except in church. If you had made your debut in the
chancel&mdash;on Sunday&mdash;it might have been different. But
that's too late now...(Bother!) Nobody, absolutely nobody, will
believe in you."</p>

<p>"I hope I am not inconveniencing you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the Vicar; "not at all. Only&mdash;.
Naturally it may be inconvenient if you tell a too incredible
story. If I might suggest (ahem)&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You see, people in the world, being men themselves, will almost
certainly regard you as a man. If you say you are not, they will
simply say you do not tell the truth. Only exceptional people
appreciate the exceptional. When in Rome one must&mdash;well,
respect Roman prejudices a little&mdash;talk Latin. You will find
it better&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You propose I should feign to become a man?"</p>

<p>"You have my meaning at once."</p>

<p>The Angel stared at the Vicar's hollyhocks and thought.</p>

<p>"Possibly, after all," he said slowly, "I shall become a man. I
may have been too hasty in saying I was not. You say there are no
angels in this world. Who am I to set myself up against your
experience? A mere thing of a day&mdash;so far as this world goes.
If you say there are no angels-clearly I must be something else. I
eat&mdash;angels do not eat. I may be a man already."</p>

<p>"A convenient view, at any rate," said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"If it is convenient to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is. And then to account for your presence here."</p>

<p>"If," said the Vicar, after a hesitating moment of reflection,
"if, for instance, you had been an ordinary man with a weakness for
wading, and you had gone wading in the Sidder, and your clothes had
been stolen, for instance, and I had come upon you in that position
of inconvenience; the explanation I shall have to make to Mrs.
Mendham&mdash;would be shorn at least of the supernatural element.
There is such a feeling against the supernatural element
nowadays&mdash;even in the pulpit. You would hardly
believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's a pity that was not the case," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the Vicar. "It is a great pity that was not
the case. But at any rate you will oblige me if you do not obtrude
your angelic nature. You will oblige everyone, in fact. There is a
settled opinion that angels do not do this kind of thing. And
nothing is more painful&mdash;as I can testify&mdash;than a
decaying settled opinion...Settled opinions are mental teeth in
more ways than one. For my own part,"&mdash;the Vicar's hand passed
over his eyes for a moment&mdash;"I cannot but believe you are an
angel...Surely I can believe my own eyes."</p>

<p>"We always do ours," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"And so do we, within limits."</p>

<p>Then the clock upon the mantel chimed seven, and almost
simultaneously Mrs. Hinijer announced dinner.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap09"></a>AFTER DINNER</h2>

<h3>&sect; XVIII</h3>

<p class="first">THE Angel and the Vicar sat at dinner. The Vicar,
with his napkin tucked in at his neck, watched the Angel struggling
with his soup. "You will soon get into the way of it," said the
Vicar. The knife and fork business was done awkwardly but with
effect. The Angel looked furtively at Delia, the little waiting
maid. When presently they sat cracking nuts&mdash;which the Angel
found congenial enough&mdash;and the girl had gone, the Angel
asked: "Was that a lady, too?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the Vicar (crack). "No she is not a lady. She is a
servant."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Angel; "she had rather a nicer shape."</p>

<p>"You mustn't tell Mrs. Mendham that," said the Vicar, covertly
satisfied.</p>

<p>"She didn't stick out so much at the shoulders and hips, and
there was more of her in between. And the colour of her robes was
not discordant&mdash;simply neutral. And her face&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mendham and her daughters had been playing tennis," said
the Vicar, feeling he ought not to listen to detraction even of his
mortal enemy. "Do you like these things&mdash;these nuts?"</p>

<p>"Very much," said the Angel. Crack.</p>

<p>"You see," said the Vicar (Chum, chum, chum). "For my own part I
entirely believe you are an Angel."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"I shot you&mdash;I saw you flutter. It's beyond dispute. In my
own mind. I admit it's curious and against my preconceptions,
but&mdash;practically&mdash;I'm assured, perfectly assured in fact,
that I saw what I certainly did see. But after the behaviour of
these people. (Crack). I really don't see how we are to persuade
people. Nowadays people are so very particular about evidence. So
that I think there is a great deal to be said for the attitude you
assume. Temporarily at least I think it would be best of you to do
as you propose to do, and behave as a man as far as possible. Of
course there is no knowing how or when you may go back. After what
has happened (Gluck, gluck, gluck&mdash;as the Vicar refills his
glass)&mdash;after what has happened I should not be surprised to
see the side of the room fall away, and the hosts of heaven appear
to take you away again take us both away even. You have so far
enlarged my imagination. All these years I have been forgetting
Wonderland. But still&mdash;It will certainly be wiser to break the
thing gently to them."</p>

<p>"This life of yours," said the Angel. "I'm still in the dark
about it. How do you begin?"</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said the Vicar. "Fancy having to explain that! We
begin existence here, you know, as babies, silly pink helpless
things wrapped in white, with goggling eyes, that yelp dismally at
the Font. Then these babies grow larger and become even
beautiful&mdash;when their faces are washed. And they continue to
grow to a certain size. They become children, boys and girls,
youths and maidens (Crack), young men and young women. That is the
finest time in life, according to many certainly the most
beautiful. Full of great hopes and dreams, vague emotions and
unexpected dangers."</p>

<p>"That was a maiden?" said the Angel, indicating the door through
which Delia had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Vicar, "that was a maiden." And paused
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then," said the Vicar, "the glamour fades and life begins in
earnest. The young men and young women pair off&mdash;most of them.
They come to me shy and bashful, in smart ugly dresses, and I marry
them. And then little pink babies come to them, and some of the
youths and maidens that were, grow fat and vulgar, and some grow
thin and shrewish, and their pretty complexions go, and they get a
queer delusion of superiority over the younger people, and all the
delight and glory goes out of their lives. So they call the delight
and glory of the younger ones, Illusion. And then they begin to
drop to pieces."</p>

<p>"Drop to pieces!" said the Angel. "How grotesque!"</p>

<p>"Their hair comes off and gets dull coloured or ashen grey,"
said the Vicar. "I, for instance." He bowed his head forward to
show a circular shining patch the size of a florin. "And their
teeth come out. Their faces collapse and become as wrinkled and dry
as a shrivelled apple. 'Corrugated' you called mine. They care more
and more for what they have to eat and to drink, and less and less
for any of the other delights of life. Their limbs get loose in the
joints, and their hearts slack, or little pieces from their lungs
come coughing up. Pain..."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Pain comes into their lives more and more. And then they go.
They do not like to go, but they have to&mdash;out of this world,
very reluctantly, clutching its pain at last in their eagerness to
stop..."</p>

<p>"Where do they go?"</p>

<p>"Once I thought I knew. But now I am older I know I do not know.
We have a Legend&mdash;perhaps it is not a legend. One may be a
churchman and disbelieve. Stokes says there is nothing in it..."
The Vicar shook his head at the bananas.</p>

<p>"And you?" said the Angel. "Were you a little pink baby?"</p>

<p>"A little while ago I was a little pink baby."</p>

<p>"Were you robed then as you are now?"</p>

<p>"Oh no! Dear me! What a queer idea! Had long white clothes, I
suppose, like the rest of them."</p>

<p>"And then you were a little boy?"</p>

<p>"A little boy."</p>

<p>"And then a glorious youth?"</p>

<p>"I was not a very glorious youth, I am afraid. I was sickly, and
too poor to be radiant, and with a timid heart. I studied hard and
pored over the dying thoughts of men long dead. So I lost the
glory, and no maiden came to me, and the dulness of life began too
soon."</p>

<p>"And you have your little pink babies?"</p>

<p>"None," said the Vicar with a scarce perceptible pause. "Yet all
the same, as you see, I am beginning to drop to pieces. Presently
my back will droop like a wilting flowerstalk. And then, in a few
thousand days more I shall be done with, and I shall go out of this
world of mine...Whither I do not know."</p>

<p>"And you have to eat like this every day?"</p>

<p>"Eat, and get clothes and keep this roof above me. There are
some very disagreeable things in this world called Cold and Rain.
And the other people here&mdash;how and why is too long a
story&mdash;have made me a kind of chorus to their lives. They
bring their little pink babies to me and I have to say a name and
some other things over each new pink baby. And when the children
have grown to be youths and maidens, they come again and are
confirmed. You will understand that better later. Then before they
may join in couples and have pink babies of their own, they must
come again and hear me read out of a book. They would be outcast,
and no other maiden would speak to the maiden who had a little pink
baby without I had read over her for twenty minutes out of my book.
It's a necessary thing, as you will see. Odd as it may seem to you.
And afterwards, when they are falling to pieces, I try and persuade
them of a strange world in which I scarcely believe myself, where
life is altogether different from what they have had&mdash;or
desire. And in the end, I bury them, and read out of my book to
those who will presently follow into the unknown land. I stand at
the beginning, and at the zenith, and at the setting of their
lives. And on every seventh day, I who am a man myself, I who see
no further than they do, talk to them of the Life to Come&mdash;the
life of which we know nothing. If such a life there be. And slowly
I drop to pieces amidst my prophesying."</p>

<p>"What a strange life!" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Vicar. "What a strange life! But the thing that
makes it strange to me is new. I had taken it as a matter of course
until you came into my life.</p>

<p>"This life of ours is so insistent," said the Vicar. "It, and
its petty needs, its temporary pleasures (Crack) swathe our souls
about. While I am preaching to these people of mine of another
life, some are ministering to one appetite and eating sweets,
others&mdash;the old men&mdash;are slumbering, the youths glance at
the maidens, the grown men protrude white waistcoats and gold
chains, pomp and vanity on a substratum of carnal substance, their
wives flaunt garish bonnets at one another. And I go on droning
away of the things unseen and unrealised&mdash;'Eye hath not seen,'
I read, 'nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the imagination of
man to conceive,' and I look up to catch an adult male immortal
admiring the fit of a pair of three and sixpenny gloves. It is
damping year after year. When I was ailing in my youth I felt
almost the assurance of vision that beneath this temporary phantasm
world was the real world&mdash;the enduring world of the Life
Everlasting. But now&mdash;"</p>

<p>He glanced at his chubby white hand, fingering the stem of his
glass. "I have put on flesh since then," he said. [Pause].</p>

<p>"I have changed and developed very much. The battle of the Flesh
and Spirit does not trouble me as it did. Every day I feel less
confidence in my beliefs, and more in God. I live, I am afraid, a
quiescent life, duties fairly done, a little ornithology and a
little chess, a trifle of mathematical trifling. My times are in
His hands&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Vicar sighed and became pensive. The Angel watched him, and
the Angel's eyes were troubled with the puzzle of him. "Gluck,
gluck, gluck," went the decanter as the Vicar refilled his
glass.</p>

<h3>&sect; XIX</h3>

<p class="first">So the Angel dined and talked to the Vicar, and
presently the night came and he was overtaken by yawning.</p>

<p>"Yah&mdash;oh!" said the Angel suddenly. "Dear me! A higher
power seemed suddenly to stretch my mouth open and a great breath
of air went rushing down my throat."</p>

<p>"You yawned," said the Vicar. "Do you never yawn in the angelic
country?"</p>

<p>"Never," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"And yet you are immortal!&mdash;I suppose you want to go to
bed."</p>

<p>"Bed!" said the Angel. "Where's that?"</p>

<p>So the Vicar explained darkness to him and the art of going to
bed. (The Angels, it seems, sleep only in order to dream, and dream
like primitive man with their foreheads on their knees. And they
sleep among the white poppy meadows in the heat of the day.) The
Angel found the bedroom arrangements quaint enough.</p>

<p>"Why is everything raised up on big wooden legs?" he said. "You
have the floor, and then you put everything you have upon a wooden
quadruped. Why do you do it?" The Vicar explained with
philosophical vagueness. The Angel burnt his finger in the
candle-flame&mdash;and displayed an absolute ignorance of the
elementary principles of combustion. He was merely charmed when a
line of fire ran up the curtains. The Vicar had to deliver a
lecture on fire so soon as the line was extinguished. He had all
kinds of explanations to make&mdash;even the soap needed
explaining. It was an hour or more before the Angel was safely
tucked in for the night.</p>

<p>"He's very beautiful," said the Vicar, descending the staircase,
quite tired out; "and he's a real Angel no doubt. But I am afraid
he will be a dreadful anxiety, all the same, before he gets into
our earthly way with things."</p>

<p>He seemed quite worried. He helped himself to an extra glass of
sherry before he put away the wine in the cellaret.</p>

<h3>&sect; XX</h3>

<p class="first">The Curate stood in front of the looking-glass and
solemnly divested himself of his collar.</p>

<p>"I never heard a more fantastic story," said Mrs. Mendham from
the basket chair. "The man must be mad. Are you sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, my dear. I've told you every word, every
incident&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well!" said Mrs. Mendham, and spread her hands. "There's no
sense in it."</p>

<p>"Precisely, my dear."</p>

<p>"The Vicar," said Mrs. Mendham, "must be mad."</p>

<p>"This hunchback is certainly one of the strangest creatures I've
seen for a long time. Foreign looking, with a big bright-coloured
face and long brown hair...It can't have been cut for months!" The
Curate put his studs carefully upon the shelf of the
dressing-table. "And a kind of staring look about his eyes, and a
simpering smile. Quite a silly looking person. Effeminate."</p>

<p>"But who can he be?" said Mrs. Mendham.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine, my dear. Nor where he came from. He might be a
chorister or something of that sort."</p>

<p>"But why should he be about the shrubbery...in that dreadful
costume?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. The Vicar gave me no explanation. He simply said,
'Mendham, this is an Angel.'"</p>

<p>"I wonder if he drinks...They may have been bathing near the
spring, of course," reflected Mrs. Mendham. "But I noticed no other
clothes on his arm."</p>

<p>The Curate sat down on his bed and unlaced his boots.</p>

<p>"It's a perfect mystery to me, my dear." (Flick, flick of
laces.) "Hallucination is the only charitable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are sure, George, that it was not a woman."</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said the Curate.</p>

<p>"I know what men are, of course."</p>

<p>"It was a young man of nineteen or twenty," said the Curate.</p>

<p>"I can't understand it," said Mrs. Mendham. "You say the
creature is staying at the Vicarage?"</p>

<p>"Hilyer is simply mad," said the Curate. He got up and went
padding round the room to the door to put out his boots. "To judge
by his manner you would really think he believed this cripple was
an Angel."

<p>"Are your shoes out, dear?"</p>

<p>"They're just by the wardrobe", said Mrs. Mendham. "He always
was a little queer, you know. There was always something childish
about him...An Angel!"</p>

<p>The Curate came and stood by the fire, fumbling with his braces.
Mrs. Mendham liked a fire even in the summer. "He shirks all the
serious problems in life and is always trifling with some new
foolishness," said the Curate. "Angel indeed!" He laughed suddenly.
"Hilyer must be mad," he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mendham laughed too. "Even that doesn't explain the
hunchback," she said.</p>

<p>"The hunchback must be mad too," said the Curate.</p>

<p>"It's the only way of explaining it in a sensible way," said
Mrs. Mendham. [Pause.]</p>

<p>"Angel or no Angel," said Mrs. Mendham, "I know what is due to
me. Even supposing the man thought he was in the company of an
Angel, that is no reason why he should not behave like a
gentleman."</p>

<p>"That is perfectly true."</p>

<p>"You will write to the Bishop, of course?"</p>

<p>Mendham coughed. "No, I shan't write to the Bishop," said
Mendham. "I think it seems a little disloyal...And he took no
notice of the last, you know."</p>

<p>"But surely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall write to Austin. In confidence. He will be sure to tell
the Bishop, you know. And you must remember, my dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That Hilyer can dismiss you, you were going to say. My dear,
the man's much too weak! I should have a word to say about that.
And besides, you do all his work for him. Practically, we manage
the parish from end to end. I do not know what would become of the
poor if it was not for me. They'd have free quarters in the
Vicarage to-morrow. There is that Goody Ansell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, my dear," said the Curate, turning away and proceeding
with his undressing. "You were telling me about her only this
afternoon."</p>

<h3>&sect; XXI</h3>

<p class="first">And thus in the little bedroom over the gable we
reach a first resting place in this story. And as we have been hard
at it, getting our story spread out before you, it may be perhaps
well to recapitulate a little.</p>

<p>Looking back you will see that much has been done; we began with
a blaze of light "not uniform but broken all over by curving
flashes like the waving of swords," and the sound of a mighty
harping, and the advent of an Angel with polychromatic wings.</p>

<p>Swiftly, dexterously, as the reader must admit, wings have been
clipped, halo handled off, the glory clapped into coat and
trousers, and the Angel made for all practical purposes a man,
under a suspicion of being either a lunatic or an impostor. You
have heard too, or at least been able to judge, what the Vicar and
the Doctor and the Curate's wife thought of the strange arrival.
And further remarkable opinions are to follow.</p>

<p>The afterglow of the summer sunset in the northwest darkens into
night and the Angel sleeps, dreaming himself back in the wonderful
world where it is always light, and everyone is happy, where fire
does not burn and ice does not chill; where rivulets of starlight
go streaming through the amaranthine meadows, out to the seas of
Peace. He dreams, and it seems to him that once more his wings glow
with a thousand colours and flash through the crystal air of the
world from which he has come.</p>

<p>So he dreams. But the Vicar lies awake, too perplexed for
dreaming. Chiefly he is troubled by the possibilities of Mrs.
Mendham; but the evening's talk has opened a kind of window in his
mind, and he is also stimulated by a sense as of something seen
darkly through a veiled window, of a hitherto unsuspected
wonderland lying about his world. For twenty years now he has held
his village living and lived his daily life, protected by his
familiar creed, by the clamour of the details of life, from any
mystical dreaming. But now interweaving with the familiar bother of
his persecuting neighbour, is an altogether unfamiliar sense of
strange new things.</p>

<p>There was something ominous in the feeling. Once, indeed, it
rose above all other considerations, and in a kind of terror he
blundered out of bed, bruised his shins very convincingly, found
the matches at last, and lit a candle to assure himself of the
reality of his own customary world again. But on the whole the more
tangible trouble was the Mendham avalanche. Her tongue seemed to be
hanging above him like the sword of Damocles. What might she not
say of this business, before her indignant imagination came to
rest?</p>

<p>And while the successful captor of the Strange Bird was sleeping
thus uneasily, Gully of Sidderton was carefully unloading his gun
after a wearisome blank day, and Sandy Bright was on his knees in
prayer, with the window carefully fastened. Annie Durgan was
sleeping hard with her mouth open, and Amory's mother was dreaming
of washing, and both of them had long since exhausted the topics of
the Sound and the Glare. Lumpy Durgan was sitting up in his bed,
now crooning the fragment of a tune and now listening intently for
a sound he had heard once and longed to hear again. As for the
solicitor's clerk at Iping Hanger, he was trying to write poetry
about a confectioner's girl at Portburdock, and the Strange Bird
was quite out of his head. But the ploughman who had seen it on the
confines of Siddermorton Park had a black eye. That had been one of
the more tangible consequences of a little argument about birds'
legs in the "Ship." It is worthy of this passing mention, since it
is probably the only known instance of an Angel causing anything of
the kind.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap10"></a>MORNING</h2>

<h3>&sect; XXII</h3>

<p class="first">THE Vicar, going to call the Angel, found him
dressed and leaning out of his window. It was a glorious morning,
still dewy, and the rising sunlight slanting round the corner of
the house struck warm and yellow upon the hillside. The birds were
astir in the hedges and shrubbery. Up the hillside&mdash;for it was
late in August&mdash;a plough drove slowly. The Angel's chin rested
upon his hands and he did not turn as the Vicar came up to him.</p>

<p>"How's the wing?" said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"I'd forgotten it," said the Angel. "Is that yonder a man?"</p>

<p>The Vicar looked. "That's a ploughman."</p>

<p>"Why does he go to and fro like that? Does it amuse him?"</p>

<p>"He's ploughing. That's his work."</p>

<p>"Work! Why does he do it? It seems a monotonous thing to
do."</p>

<p>"It is," admitted the Vicar. "But he has to do it to get a
living, you know. To get food to eat and all that kind of
thing."</p>

<p>"How curious!" said the Angel. "Do all men have to do that? Do
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. He does it for me; does my share."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"Oh! in return for things I do for him, you know. We go in for
division of labour in this world. Exchange is no robbery."</p>

<p>"I see," said the Angel, with his eyes still on the ploughman's
heavy movements.</p>

<p>"What do you do for him?"</p>

<p>"That seems an easy question to you," said the Vicar, "but
really!&mdash;it's difficult. Our social arrangements are rather
complicated. It's impossible to explain these things all at once,
before breakfast. Don't you feel hungry?"</p>

<p>"I think I do," said the Angel slowly, still at the window; and
then abruptly, "Somehow I can't help thinking that ploughing must
be far from enjoyable."</p>

<p>"Possibly," said the Vicar, "very possibly. But breakfast is
ready. Won't you come down?"</p>

<p>The Angel left the window reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Our society," explains the Vicar on the stair-case, "is a
complicated organisation."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"And it is so arranged that some do one thing and some
another."</p>

<p>"And that lean, bent old man trudges after that heavy blade of
iron pulled by a couple of horses while we go down to eat?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You will find it is perfectly just. Ah! mushrooms and
poached eggs! It's the Social System. Pray be seated. Possibly it
strikes you as unfair."</p>

<p>"I'm puzzled," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"The drink I'm sending you is called coffee," said the Vicar. "I
daresay you are. When I was a young man I was puzzled in the same
way. But afterwards comes a Broader View of Things. (These black
things are called mushrooms; they look beautiful.) Other
Considerations. All men are brothers, of course, but some are
younger brothers, so to speak. There is work that requires culture
and refinement, and work in which culture and refinement would be
an impediment. And the rights of property must not be forgotten.
One must render unto Caesar...Do you know, instead of explaining
this matter now (this is yours), I think I will lend you a little
book to read (chum, chum, chum&mdash;these mushrooms are well up to
their appearance), which sets the whole thing out very
clearly."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap11"></a>THE VIOLIN</h2>

<h3>&sect; XXIII</h3>

<p class="first">AFTER breakfast the Vicar went into the little
room next his study to find a book on Political Economy for the
Angel to read. For the Angel's social ignorances were clearly
beyond any verbal explanations. The door stood ajar.</p>

<p>"What is that?" said the Angel, following him. "A violin!" He
took it down.</p>

<p>"You play?" said the Vicar.</p>

<p>The Angel had the bow in his hand, and by way of answer drove it
across the strings. The quality of the note made the Vicar turn
suddenly. The Angel's hand tightened on the instrument. The bow
flew back and flickered, and an air the Vicar had never heard
before danced in his ears. The Angel shifted the fiddle under his
dainty chin and went on playing, and as he played his eyes grew
bright and his lips smiled. At first he looked at the Vicar, then
his expression became abstracted. He seemed no longer to look at
the Vicar, but through him, at something beyond, something in his
memory or his imagination, something infinitely remote, undreamt of
hitherto...The Vicar tried to follow the music. The air reminded
him of a flame, it rushed up, shone, flickered and danced, passed
and reappeared. No!&mdash;it did not reappear! Another
air&mdash;like it and unlike it, shot up after it, wavered,
vanished. Then another, the same and not the same. It reminded him
of the flaring tongues that palpitate and change above a newly lit
fire. There are two airs&mdash;or motifs, which is
it?&mdash;thought the Vicar. He knew remarkably little of musical
technique. They go dancing up, one pursuing the other, out of the
fire of the incantation, pursuing, fluctuating, turning, up into
the sky. There below was the fire burning, a flame without fuel
upon a level space, and there two flirting butterflies of sound,
dancing away from it, up, one over another, swift, abrupt,
uncertain. "Flirting butterflies were they!" What was the Vicar
thinking of? Where was he? In the little room next to his study, of
course! And the Angel standing in front of him smiling into his
face, playing the violin, and looking through him as though he was
only a window&mdash;.</p>

<p>That motif again, a yellow flare, spread fanlike by a gust, and
now one, then with a swift eddying upward flight the other, the two
things of fire and light pursuing one another again up into that
clear immensity. The study and the realities of life suddenly faded
out of the Vicar's eyes, grew thinner and thinner like a mist that
dissolves into air, and he and the Angel stood together on a
pinnacle of wrought music, about which glittering melodies circled,
and vanished, and reappeared. He was in the land of Beauty, and
once more the glory of heaven was upon the Angel's face, and the
glowing delights of colour pulsated in his wings. Himself the Vicar
could not see. But I cannot tell you of the vision of that great
and spacious land, of its incredible openness, and height, and
nobility. For there is no space there like ours, no time as we know
it; one must needs speak by burgling metaphors and own in
bitterness after all that one has failed. And it was only a
vision.</p>

<p>The wonderful creatures flying through the aether saw them not
as they stood there, flew through them as one might pass through a
whisp of mist. The Vicar lost all sense of duration, all sense of
necessity&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Angel, suddenly putting down the fiddle. The
Vicar had forgotten the book on Political Economy, had forgotten
everything until the Angel had done. For a minute he sat quite
still. Then he woke up with a start. He was sitting on the old
iron-bound chest.</p>

<p>"Really," he said slowly, "you are very clever." He looked about
him in a puzzled way. "I had a kind of vision while you were
playing. I seemed to see&mdash;. What did I see? It has gone." He
stood up with a dazzled expression upon his face. "I shall never
play the violin again," he said. "I wish you would take it to your
room&mdash;and keep it&mdash;. And play to me again. I did not know
anything of music until I heard you play. I do not feel as though I
had ever heard any music before." He stared at the Angel, then
about him at the room. "I have never felt anything of this kind
with music before," he said. He shook his head. "I shall never play
again."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap12"></a>THE ANGEL EXPLORES THE VILLAGE</h2>

<h3>&sect; XXIV</h3>

<p class="first">VERY unwisely, as I think, the Vicar allowed the
Angel to go down into the village by himself, to enlarge his ideas
of humanity. Unwisely, because how was he to imagine the reception
the Angel would receive? Not thoughtlessly, I am afraid. He had
always carried himself with decorum in the village, and the idea of
a slow procession through the main street with all the inevitable
curious remarks, explanations, pointings, was too much for him. The
Angel might do the strangest things, the village was certain to
think them. Peering faces. "Who's he got now?" Besides, was it not
his duty to prepare his sermon in good time? The Angel, duly
directed, went down cheerfully by himself&mdash;still innocent of
most of the peculiarities of the human as distinguished from the
angelic turn of mind.</p>

<p>The Angel walked slowly, his white hands folded behind his
hunched back, his sweet face looking this way and that. He peered
curiously into the eyes of the people he met. A little child
picking a bunch of vetch and honeysuckle looked in his face, and
forthwith came and put them in his hand. It was about the only
kindness he had from a human being (saving only the Vicar and one
other). He heard Mother Gustick scolding that granddaughter of hers
as he passed the door. "You Brazen Faggit-you!" said Mother
Gustick. "You Trumpery Baggage!"</p>

<p>The Angel stopped, startled at the strange sounds of Mother
Gustick's voice. "Put yer best clo'es on, and yer feather in yer
'at, and off you goes to meet en, fal lal, and me at 'ome slaving
for ye. 'Tis a Fancy Lady you'll be wantin' to be, my gal, a
walkin' Touch and Go, with yer idleness and finery&mdash;"</p>

<p>The voice ceased abruptly, and a great peace came upon the
battered air. "Most grotesque and strange!" said the Angel, still
surveying this wonderful box of discords. "Walking Touch and Go!"
He did not know that Mrs. Gustick had suddenly become aware of his
existence, and was scrutinising his appearance through the
window-blind. Abruptly the door flew open, and she stared out into
the Angel's face. A strange apparition, grey and dusty hair, and
the dirty pink dress unhooked to show the stringy throat, a
discoloured gargoyle, presently to begin spouting incomprehensible
abuse.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Mister," began Mrs. Gustick. "Have ye nothin' better
to do than listen at people's doors for what you can pick up?"</p>

<p>The Angel stared at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>"D'year!" said Mrs. Gustick, evidently very angry indeed.
"Listenin'."</p>

<p>"Have you any objection to my hearing..."</p>

<p>"Object to my hearing! Course I have! Whad yer think? You ain't
such a Ninny..."</p>

<p>"But if ye didn't want me to hear, why did you cry out so loud?
I thought..."</p>

<p>"You thought! Softie-that's what you are! You silly girt staring
Gaby, what don't know any better than to come holding yer girt
mouth wide open for all that you can catch holt on? And then off up
there to tell! You great Fat-Faced, Tale-Bearin' Silly-Billy! I'd
be ashamed to come poking and peering round quiet people's
houses..."</p>

<p>The Angel was surprised to find that some inexplicable quality
in her voice excited the most disagreeable sensations in him and a
strong desire to withdraw. But, resisting this, he stood listening
politely (as the custom is in the Angelic Land, so long as anyone
is speaking). The entire eruption was beyond his comprehension. He
could not perceive any reason for the sudden projection of this
vituperative head, out of infinity, so to speak. And questions
without a break for an answer were outside his experience
altogether.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gustick proceeded with her characteristic fluency, assured
him he was no gentleman, enquired if he called himself one,
remarked that every tramp did as much nowadays, compared him to a
Stuck Pig, marvelled at his impudence, asked him if he wasn't
ashamed of himself standing there, enquired if he was rooted to the
ground, was curious to be told what he meant by it, wanted to know
whether he robbed a scarecrow for his clothes, suggested that an
abnormal vanity prompted his behaviour, enquired if his mother knew
he was out, and finally remarking, "I got somethin'll move you, my
gentleman," disappeared with a ferocious slamming of the door.</p>

<p>The interval struck the Angel as singularly peaceful. His
whirling mind had time to analyse his sensations. He ceased bowing
and smiling, and stood merely astonished.</p>

<p>"This is a curious painful feeling," said the Angel. "Almost
worse than Hungry, and quite different. When one is hungry one
wants to eat. I suppose she was a woman. Here one wants to get
away. I suppose I might just as well go."</p>

<p>He turned slowly and went down the road meditating. He heard the
cottage door reopen, and turning his head, saw through intervening
scarlet runners Mrs. Gustick with a steaming saucepan full of
boiling cabbage water in her hand.</p>

<p>"'Tis well you went, Mister Stolen Breeches," came the voice of
Mrs. Gustick floating down through the vermilion blossoms. "Don't
you come peeping and prying round this yer cottage again or I'll
learn ye manners, I will!"</p>

<p>The Angel stood in a state of considerable perplexity. He had no
desire to come within earshot of the cottage again ever. He did not
understand the precise import of the black pot, but his general
impression was entirely disagreeable. There was no explaining
it.</p>

<p>"I mean it!" said Mrs. Gustick, crescendo. "Drat it! I mean
it."</p>

<p>The Angel turned and went on, a dazzled look in his eyes.</p>

<p>"She was very grotesque!" said the Angel. "Very. Much more than
the little man in black. And she means it.&mdash;But what she means
I don't know!..." He became silent. "I suppose they all mean
something," he said, presently, still perplexed.</p>

<h3>&sect; XXV</h3>

<p class="first">Then the Angel came in sight of the forge, where
Sandy Bright's brother was shoeing a horse for the carter from
Upmorton. Two hobbledehoys were standing by the forge staring in a
bovine way at the proceedings. As the Angel approached these two
and then the carter turned slowly through an angle of thirty
degrees and watched his approach, staring quietly and steadily at
him. The expression on their faces was one of abstract
interest.</p>

<p>The Angel became self-conscious for the first time in his life.
He drew nearer, trying to maintain an amiable expression on his
face, an expression that beat in vain against their granitic stare.
His hands were behind him. He smiled pleasantly, looking curiously
at the (to him) incomprehensible employment of the smith. But the
battery of eyes seemed to angle for his regard. Trying to meet the
three pairs at once, the Angel lost his alertness and stumbled over
a stone. One of the yokels gave a sarcastic cough, and was
immediately covered with confusion at the Angel's enquiring gaze,
nudging his companion with his elbow to cover his disorder. None
spoke, and the Angel did not speak.</p>

<p>So soon as the Angel had passed, one of the three hummed this
tune in an aggressive tone.</p>

<p>Then all three of them laughed. One tried to sing something and
found his throat contained phlegm. The Angel proceeded on his
way.</p>

<p>"Who's e then?" said the second hobbledehoy.</p>

<p>"Ping, ping, ping," went the blacksmith's hammer.</p>

<p>"Spose he's one of these here foweners," said the carter from
Upmorton. "D&auml;amned silly fool he do look to be sure."</p>

<p>"Tas the way with them foweners," said the first hobbledehoy
sagely.</p>

<p>"Got something very like the 'ump," said the carter from
Upmorton. "D&auml;&auml;-&auml;-&auml;mned if 'E ent."</p>

<p>Then the silence healed again, and they resumed their quiet
expressionless consideration of the Angel's retreating figure.</p>

<p>"Very like the 'ump et is," said the carter after an enormous
pause.</p>

<h3>&sect; XXVI</h3>

<p class="first">The Angel went on through the village, finding it
all wonderful enough. "They begin, and just a little while and then
they end," he said to himself in a puzzled voice. "But what are
they doing meanwhile?" Once he heard some invisible mouth chant
inaudible words to the tune the man at the forge had hummed.</p>

<p>"That's the poor creature the Vicar shot with that great gun of
his," said Sarah Glue, of 1, Church Cottages, peering over the
blind.</p>

<p>"He looks Frenchified," said Susan Hopper, peering through the
interstices of that convenient veil on curiosity.</p>

<p>"He has sweet eyes," said Sarah Glue, who had met them for a
moment.</p>

<p>The Angel sauntered on. The postman passed him and touched his
hat to him; further down was a dog asleep in the sun. He went on
and saw Mendham, who nodded distantly and hurried past. (The Curate
did not care to be seen talking to an Angel in the village, until
more was known about him.) There came from one of the houses the
sound of a child screaming in a passion, that brought a puzzled
look to the Angelic face. Then the Angel reached the bridge below
the last of the houses, and stood leaning over the parapet watching
the glittering little cascade from the mill.</p>

<p>"They begin, and just a little while, and then they end," said
the weir from the mill. The water raced under the bridge, green and
dark, and streaked with foam.</p>

<p>Beyond the mill rose the square tower of the church, with the
churchyard behind it, a spray of tombstones and wooden headboards
splashed up the hillside. A half dozen of beech trees framed the
picture.</p>

<p>Then the Angel heard a shuffling of feet and the gride of wheels
behind him, and turning his head saw a man dressed in dirty brown
rags and a felt hat grey with dust, who was standing with a slight
swaying motion and fixedly regarding the Angelic back. Beyond him
was another almost equally dirty, pushing a knife grinder's barrow
over the bridge.</p>

<p>"Mornin'," said the first person smiling weakly. "Goomorn'." He
arrested an escaping hiccough.</p>

<p>The Angel stared at him. He had never seen a really fatuous
smile before. "Who are you?" said the Angel.</p>

<p>The fatuous smile faded. "No your business whoaaam.
Wishergoomorn."</p>

<p>"Carm on:" said the man with the grindstone, passing on his
way.</p>

<p>"Wishergoomorn," said the dirty man, in a tone of extreme
aggravation. "Carncher Answerme?"</p>

<p>"Carm on you fool!" said the man with the grindstone
receding.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Donunderstan'. Sim'l enough. Wishergoomorn'. Willyanswerme?
Wontchr? gemwisher-gem goomorn. Cusom answer goomorn. No gem.
Haverteachyer."</p>

<p>The Angel was puzzled. The drunken man stood swaying for a
moment, then he made an unsteady snatch at his hat and threw it
down at the Angel's feet. "Ver well," he said, as one who decides
great issues.</p>

<p>"Carm on!" said the voice of the man with the grindstone
stopping perhaps twenty yards off.</p>

<p>"You wan fight, you&mdash;" the Angel failed to catch the word.
"I'll show yer, not answer gem's goomorn."</p>

<p>He began to struggle with his jacket. "Think I'm drun," he said,
"I show yer." The man with the grindstone sat down on the shaft to
watch. "Carm on," he said. The jacket was intricate, and the
drunken man began to struggle about the road, in his attempts to
extricate himself, breathing threatenings and slaughter. Slowly the
Angel began to suspect remotely enough, that these demonstrations
were hostile. "Mur wun know yer when I done wi' yer," said the
drunken man, coat almost over his head.</p>

<p>At last the garment lay on the ground, and through the frequent
interstices of his reminiscences of a waistcoat, the drunken tinker
displayed a fine hairy and muscular body to the Angel's observant
eyes. He squared up in masterly fashion.</p>

<p>"Take the paint off yer," he remarked, advancing and receding,
fists up and elbows out.</p>

<p>"Carm on," floated down the road.</p>

<p>The Angel's attention was concentrated on two huge hairy black
fists, that swayed and advanced and retreated. "Come on d'yer say?
I'll show yer," said the gentleman in rags, and then with
extraordinary ferocity: "My crikey! I'll show yer."</p>

<p>Suddenly he lurched forward, and with a new-born instinct and
raising a defensive arm as he did so, the Angel stepped aside to
avoid him. The fist missed the Angelic shoulder by a hairsbreadth,
and the tinker collapsed in a heap with his face against the
parapet of the bridge. The Angel hesitated over the writhing dusty
heap of blasphemy for a moment, and then turned towards the man's
companion up the road. "Lemmeget up," said the man on the bridge.
"Lemmeget up, you swine. I'll show yer."</p>

<p>A strange disgust, a quivering repulsion came upon the Angel. He
walked slowly away from the drunkard towards the man with the
grindstone.</p>

<p>"What does it all mean?" said the Angel. "I don't understand
it."</p>

<p>"Dam fool!...says it's 'is silver weddin'," answered the man
with the grindstone, evidently much annoyed; and then, in a tone of
growing impatience, he called down the road once more: "Carm
on!"</p>

<p>"Silver wedding!" said the Angel. "What is a silver
wedding?"</p>

<p>"Jest is rot," said the man on the barrow. "But E's always avin'
some 'scuse like that. Fair sickenin' it is. Lars week it wus 'is
bloomin' birthday, and then 'e ad'nt ardly got sober orf a
comlimentary drunk to my noo barrer. (Carm on, you fool.)"</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," said the Angel. "Why does he sway
about so? Why does he keep on trying to pick up his hat like
that&mdash;and missing it?"</p>

<p>"Why!" said the tinker. "Well this is a blasted innocent
country! Why! Because 'E's blind! Wot else? (Carm on-Dam yer.)
Because 'E's just as full as 'E can 'old. That's why!"</p>

<p>The Angel noticing the tone of the second tinker's voice, judged
it wiser not to question him further. But he stood by the
grindstone and continued to watch the mysterious evolutions on the
bridge.</p>

<p>"Carm on! I shall 'ave to go and pick up that 'at I
suppose...'E's always at it. I ne'er 'ad such a blooming pard
before. Always at it, 'e is."</p>

<p>The man with the barrow meditated. "Taint as if 'e was a
gentleman and 'adnt no livin' to get. An' 'e's such a reckless fool
when 'e gets a bit on. Goes offerin out everyone 'e meets. (There
you go!) I'm blessed if 'e didn't offer out a 'ole bloomin'
Salvation Army. No judgment in it. (Oh! Carm on! Carm on!) 'Ave to
go and pick this bloomin' 'at up now I s'pose. 'E don't care wot
trouble 'e gives."</p>

<p>The Angel watched the second tinker walk back, and, with
affectionate blasphemy, assist the first to his hat and his coat.
Then he turned, absolutely mystified, towards the village
again.</p>

<h3>&sect; XXVII</h3>

<p class="first">After that incident the Angel walked along past
the mill and round behind the church, to examine the
tombstones.</p>

<p>"This seems to be the place where they put the broken pieces,"
said the Angel reading the inscriptions. "Curious
word&mdash;relict! Kesurgam! Then they are not done with quite.
What a huge pile it requires to keep her down!...It is spirited of
her."</p>

<p>"Hawkins?" said the Angel softly..."Hawkins? The name is
strange to me...He did not die then...It is plain
enough,&mdash;Joined the Angelic Hosts, May 17, 1863. He must have
felt as much out of place as I do down here. But I wonder why they
put that little pot thing on the top of this monument. Curious!
There are several others about&mdash;little stone pots with a rag
of stiff stone drapery over them."</p>

<p>Just then the boys came pouring out of the National School, and
first one and then several stopped agape at the Angel's crooked
black figure among the white tombs. "Ent 'e gart a b&auml;&auml;k
on en!" remarked one critic.</p>

<p>"'E's got 'air like a girl!" said another.</p>

<p>The Angel turned towards them. He was struck by the queer little
heads sticking up over the lichenous wall. He smiled faintly at
their staring faces, and then turned to marvel at the iron railings
that enclosed the Fitz-Jarvis tomb. "A queer air of uncertainty,"
he said. "Slabs, piles of stone, these railings...Are they
afraid?...Do these Dead ever try and get up again? There's an air
of repression-fortification&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get yer 'air cut, Get yer 'air cut," sang three little boys
together.</p>

<p>"Curious these Human Beings are!" said the Angel. "That man
yesterday wanted to cut off my wings, now these little creatures
want me to cut off my hair! And the man on the bridge offered to
take the 'paint' off of me. They will leave nothing of me
soon."</p>

<p>"Where did you get that 'at?" sang another little boy. "Where
did you get them clo'es?"</p>

<p>"They ask questions that they evidently do not want answered,"
said the Angel. "I can tell from the tone." He looked thoughtfully
at the little boys. "I don't understand the methods of Human
intercourse. These are probably friendly advances, a kind of
ritual. But I don't know the responses. I think I will go back to
the little fat man in black, with the gold chain across his
stomach, and ask him to explain. It is difficult."</p>

<p>He turned towards the lych gate. "Oh!" said one of the little
boys, in a shrill falsetto, and threw a beechnut husk. It came
bounding across the churchyard path. The Angel stopped in
surprise.</p>

<p>This made all the little boys laugh. A second imitating the
first, said "Oh!" and hit the Angel. His astonishment was really
delicious. They all began crying "Oh!" and throwing beechnut husks.
One hit the Angel's hand, another stung him smartly by the ear. The
Angel made ungainly movements towards them. He spluttered some
expostulation and made for the roadway. The little boys were amazed
and shocked at his discomfiture and cowardice. Such sawney
behaviour could not be encouraged. The pelting grew vigorously. You
may perhaps be able to imagine those vivid moments, daring small
boys running in close and delivering shots, milder small boys
rushing round behind with flying discharges, Milton Screever's
mongrel dog was roused to yelping ecstacy at the sight, and danced
(full of wild imaginings) nearer and nearer to the Angelic
legs.</p>

<p>"Hi, hi!" said a vigorous voice. "I never did! Where's Mr.
Jarvis? Manners, manners! you young rascals."</p>

<p>The youngsters scattered right and left, some over the wall into
the playground, some down the street.</p>

<p>"Frightful pest these boys are getting!" said Crump, coming up.
"I'm sorry they have been annoying you."</p>

<p>The Angel seemed quite upset. "I don't understand," he said.
"These Human ways..."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Unusual to you. How's your excrescence?"</p>

<p>"My what?" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Bifid limb, you know. How is it? Now you're down this way, come
in. Come in and let me have a look at it again. You young roughs!
And meanwhile these little louts of ours will be getting off home.
They're all alike in these villages. Can't understand anything
abnormal. See an odd-looking stranger. Chuck a stone. No
imagination beyond the parish...(I'll give you physic if I catch
you annoying strangers again.)...I suppose it's what one might
expect...Come along this way."</p>

<p>So the Angel, horribly perplexed still, was hurried into the
surgery to have his wound re-dressed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap13"></a>LADY HAMMERGALLOW'S VIEW</h2>

<h3>&sect; XXVIII</h3>

<p class="first">IN Siddermorton Park is Siddermorton House, where
old Lady Hammergallow lives, chiefly upon Burgundy and the little
scandals of the village, a dear old lady with a ropy neck, a
ruddled countenance and spasmodic gusts of odd temper, whose three
remedies for all human trouble among her dependents are, a bottle
of gin, a pair of charity blankets, or a new crown piece. The House
is a mile-and-a-half out of Siddermorton. Almost all the village is
hers, saving a fringe to the south which belongs to Sir John Gotch,
and she rules it with an autocratic rule, refreshing in these days
of divided government. She orders and forbids marriages, drives
objectionable people out of the village by the simple expedient of
raising their rent, dismisses labourers, obliges heretics to go to
church, and made Susan Dangett, who wanted to call her little girl
"Euphemia," have the infant christened "Mary-Anne."</p>

<p>She is a sturdy Broad Protestant and disapproves of the Vicar's
going bald like a tonsure. She is on the Village Council, which
obsequiously trudges up the hill and over the moor to her, and (as
she is a trifle deaf) speaks all its speeches into her speaking
trumpet instead of a rostrum. She takes no interest now in
politics, but until last year she was an active enemy of "that
Gladstone." She has parlour maids instead of footmen to do her
waiting, because of Hockley, the American stockbroker, and his four
Titans in plush. She exercises what is almost a fascination upon
the village. If in the bar-parlour of the Cat and Cornucopia you
swear by God no one would be shocked, but if you swore by Lady
Harnmergallow they would probably be shocked enough to turn you out
of the room.</p>

<p>When she drives through Siddermorton she always calls upon Bessy
Flump, the post-mistress, to hear all that has happened, and then
upon Miss Finch, the dressmaker, to check back Bessy Flump.
Sometimes she calls upon the Vicar, sometimes upon Mrs. Mendham
whom she snubs, and even sometimes on Crump. Her sparkling pair of
greys almost ran over the Angel as he was walking down to the
village.</p>

<p>"So that's the genius!" said Lady Hammergallow, and turned and
looked at him through the gilt glasses on a stick that she always
carried in her shrivelled and shaky hand. "Lunatic indeed! The poor
creature has rather a pretty face. I'm sorry I've missed him."</p>

<p>But she went on to the vicarage nevertheless, and demanded news
of it all. The conflicting accounts of Miss Flump, Miss Finch, Mrs.
Mendham, Crump, and Mrs. Jehoram had puzzled her immensely. The
Vicar, hard pressed, did all he could to say into her speaking
trumpet what had really happened. He toned down the wings and the
saffron robe. But he felt the case was hopeless. He spoke of his
prot&eacute;g&eacute; as "Mr." Angel. He addressed pathetic asides
to the kingfisher. The old lady noticed his confusion. Her queer
old head went jerking backwards and forwards, now the speaking
trumpet in his face when he had nothing to say, then the shrunken
eyes peering at him, oblivious of the explanation that was coming
from his lips. A great many Ohs! and Ahs! She caught some fragments
certainly.</p>

<p>"You have asked him to stop with you&mdash;indefinitely?" said
Lady Hammergallow with a Great Idea taking shape rapidly in her
mind.</p>

<p>"I did&mdash;perhaps inadvertently make such&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you don't know where he comes from?"</p>

<p>"Not at all."</p>

<p>"Nor who his father is, I suppose?" said Lady Hammergallow
mysteriously.</p>

<p>"No," said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Now!" said Lady Hammergallow archly, and keeping her glasses to
her eye, she suddenly dug at his ribs with her trumpet.</p>

<p>"My dear Lady Hammergallow!"</p>

<p>"I thought so. Don't think I would blame you, Mr. Hilyer." She
gave a corrupt laugh that she delighted in. "The world is the
world, and men are men. And the poor boy's a cripple, eh? A kind of
judgment. In mourning, I noticed. It reminds me of the Scarlet
Letter. The mother's dead, I suppose. It's just as well.
Really&mdash;I'm not a narrow woman&mdash;I respect you for having
him. Really I do."</p>

<p>"But, Lady Hammergallow!"</p>

<p>"Don't spoil everything by denying it. It is so very, very
plain, to a woman of the world. That Mrs. Mendham! She amuses me
with her suspicions. Such odd ideas! In a Curate's wife. But I hope
it didn't happen when you were in orders."</p>

<p>"Lady Hammergallow, I protest. Upon my word."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hilyer, I protest. I know. Not anything you can say will
alter my opinion one jot. Don't try. I never suspected you were
nearly such an interesting man."</p>

<p>"But this suspicion is unendurable!"</p>

<p>"We will help him together, Mr. Hilyer. You may rely upon me. It
is most romantic." She beamed benevolence.</p>

<p>"But, Lady Hammergallow, I must speak!"</p>

<p>She gripped her ear-trumpet resolutely, and held it before her
and shook her head.</p>

<p>"He has quite a genius for music, Vicar, so I hear?"</p>

<p>"I can assure you most solemnly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought so. And being a cripple&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are under a most cruel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought that if his gift is really what that Jehoram woman
says."</p>

<p>"An unjustifiable suspicion that ever a man&mdash;"</p>

<p>("I don't think much on her judgment, of course.")</p>

<p>"Consider my position. Have I gained no character?"

<p>"It might be possible to do something for him as a performer."</p>

<p>"Have I&mdash;(Bother! It's no good!)"

<p>"And so, dear Vicar, I propose to give him an opportunity of showing
us what he can do. I have been thinking it all over as I drove here. On
Tuesday next, I will invite just a few people of taste, and he shall
bring his violin. Eigh? And if that goes well, I will see if I can get
some introductions and really push him."</p>

<p>"But Lady, Lady Hammergallow."</p>

<p>"Not another word!" said Lady Hammergallow, still resolutely
holding her speaking trumpet before her and clutching her
eyeglasses. "I really must not leave those horses. Cutler is so
annoyed if I keep them too long. He finds waiting tedious, poor
man, unless there is a public-house near." She made for the
door.</p>

<p>"Damn!" said the Vicar, under his breath. He had never used the
word since he had taken orders. It shows you how an Angel's visit
may disorganise a man. He stood under the verandah watching the
carriage drive away. The world seemed coming to pieces about him.
Had he lived a virtuous celibate life for thirty odd years in vain?
The things of which these people thought him capable! He stood and
stared at the green cornfield opposite, and down at the straggling
village. It seemed real enough. And yet for the first time in his
life there was a queer doubt of its reality. He rubbed his chin,
then turned and went slowly upstairs to his dressing-room, and sat
for a long time staring at a garment of some yellow texture.</p>

<p>"Know his father!" he said. "And he is immortal, and was
fluttering about his heaven when my ancestors were marsupials...I
wish he was there now."</p>

<p>He got up and began to feel the robe.</p>

<p>"I wonder how they get such things," said the Vicar. Then he
went and stared out of the window. "I suppose everything is
wonderful, even the rising and setting of the sun. I suppose there
is no adamantine ground for any belief. But one gets into a regular
way of taking things. This disturbs it. I seem to be waking up to
the Invisible. It is the strangest of uncertainties. I have not
felt so stirred and unsettled since my adolescence."</p>

<h2><a id="chap14"></a>FURTHER ADVENTURES OF THE ANGEL IN THE
VILLAGE</h2>

<h3>&sect; XXIX</h3>

<p class="first">"THAT'S all right," said Crump when the bandaging
was replaced. "It's a trick of memory, no doubt, but these
excrescences of yours don't seem nearly so large as they did
yesterday. I suppose they struck me rather forcibly. Stop and have
lunch with me now you're down here. Midday meal, you know. The
youngsters will be swallowed up by school again in the
afternoon."</p>

<p>"I never saw anything heal so well in my life," he said, as they
walked into the dining-room. "Your blood and flesh must be as clean
and free from bacteria as they make 'em. Whatever stuff there is in
your head," he added sotto voce.</p>

<p>At lunch he watched the Angel narrowly, and talked to draw him
out.</p>

<p>"Journey tire you yesterday?" he said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Journey!" said the Angel. "Oh! my wings felt a little
stiff."</p>

<p>("Not to be had") said Crump to himself. ("Suppose I must enter
into it.")</p>

<p>"So you flew all the way, eigh? No conveyance?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't any way," explained the Angel, taking mustard. "I
was flying up a symphony with some Griffins and Fiery Cherubim, and
suddenly everything went dark and I was in this world of
yours."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Crump. "And that's why you haven't any luggage."
He drew his serviette across his mouth, and a smile flickered in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know this world of ours pretty well? Watching us
over the adamantine walls and all that kind of thing. Eigh?"</p>

<p>"Not very well. We dream of it sometimes. In the moonlight, when
the Nightmares have fanned us to sleep with their wings."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes of course," said Crump. "Very poetical way of putting
it. Won't you take some Burgundy? It's just beside you."</p>

<p>"There's a persuasion in this world, you know, that Angels'
Visits are by no means infrequent. Perhaps some of your friends
have travelled? They are supposed to come down to deserving persons
in prisons, and do refined Nautches and that kind of thing. Faust
business, you know."</p>

<p>"I've never heard of anything of the kind," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Only the other day a lady whose baby was my patient for the
time being&mdash;indigestion&mdash;assured me that certain facial
contortions the little creature made indicated that it was Dreaming
of Angels. In the novels of Mrs. Henry Wood that is spoken of as an
infallible symptom of an early departure. I suppose you can't throw
any light on that obscure pathological manifestation?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand it at all," said the Angel, puzzled, and not
clearly apprehending the Doctor's drift.</p>

<p>("Getting huffy,") said Crump to himself. ("Sees I'm poking fun
at him.") "There's one thing I'm curious about. Do the new arrivals
complain much about their medical attendants? I've always fancied
there must be a good deal of hydropathic talk just at first. I was
looking at that picture in the Academy only this June..."</p>

<p>"New Arrivals!" said the Angel. "I really don't follow you."</p>

<p>The Doctor stared. "Don't they come?"</p>

<p>"Come!" said the Angel. "Who?"</p>

<p>"The people who die here."</p>

<p>"After they've gone to pieces here?"</p>

<p>"That's the general belief, you know."</p>

<p>"People, like the woman who screamed out of the door, and the
blackfaced man and his volutations and the horrible little things
that threw husks!&mdash;certainly not. I never saw such creatures
before I fell into this world."</p>

<p>"Oh! but come!" said the Doctor. "You'll tell me next your
official robes are not white and that you can't play the harp."</p>

<p>"There's no such thing as white in the Angelic Land," said the
Angel. "It's that queer blank colour you get by mixing up all the
others."</p>

<p>"Why, my dear Sir!" said the Doctor, suddenly altering his tone,
"you positively know nothing about the Land you come from. White's
the very essence of it."</p>

<p>The Angel stared at him. Was the man jesting? He looked
perfectly serious.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Crump, and getting up, he went to the
sideboard on which a copy of the Parish Magazine was lying. He
brought it round to the Angel and opened it at the coloured
supplement. "Here's some real Angels," he said. "You see it's not
simply the wings make the Angel. White you see, with a curly whisp
of robe, sailing up into the sky with their wings furled. Those are
angels on the best authority. Hydroxyl kind of hair. One has a bit
of a harp, you see, and the other is helping this wingless
lady&mdash;kind of larval Angel, you know&mdash;upward."</p>

<p>"Oh! but really!" said the Angel, "those are not Angels at
all."</p>

<p>"But they are," said Crump, putting the magazine back on the
sideboard and resuming his seat with an air of intense
satisfaction. "I can assure you I have the best authority..."</p>

<p>"I can assure you..."</p>

<p>Crump tucked in the corners of his mouth and shook his head from
side to side even as he had done to the Vicar. "No good," he said,
"can't alter our ideas just because an irresponsible
visitor..."</p>

<p>"If these are Angels," said the Angel, "then I have never been
in the Angelic Land."</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Crump, ineffably self-satisfied; "that was
just what I was getting at."</p>

<p>The Angel stared at him for a minute round eyed, and then was
seized for the second time by the human disorder of laughter.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" said Crump, joining in. "I thought you were not
quite so mad as you seemed. Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>And for the rest of the lunch they were both very merry, for
entirely different reasons, and Crump insisted upon treating the
Angel as a "dorg" of the highest degree.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XXX</h3>

<p class="first">After the Angel had left Crump's house he went up
the hill again towards the Vicarage. But&mdash;possibly moved by
the desire to avoid Mrs. Gustick&mdash;he turned aside at the stile
and made a detour by the Lark's Field and Bradley's Farm.</p>

<p>He came upon the Respectable Tramp slumbering peacefully among
the wild-flowers. He stopped to look, struck by the celestial
tranquillity of that individual's face. And even as he did so the
Respectable Tramp awoke with a start and sat up. He was a pallid
creature, dressed in rusty black, with a broken-spirited crush hat
cocked over one eye. "Good afternoon," he said affably. "How are
you?"</p>

<p>"Very well, thank you," said the Angel, who had mastered the
phrase.</p>

<p>The Respectable Tramp eyed the Angel critically. "Padding the
Hoof, matey?" he said. "Like me."</p>

<p>The Angel was puzzled by him. "Why," asked the Angel, "do you
sleep like this instead of sleeping up in the air on a Bed?"</p>

<p>"Well I'm blowed!" said the Respectable Tramp. "Why don't I
sleep in a bed? Well, it's like this. Sandringham's got the
painters in, there's the drains up in Windsor Castle, and I 'aven't
no other 'ouse to go to. You 'aven't the price of a arf pint in
your pocket, 'ave yer?"</p>

<p>"I have nothing in my pocket," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Is this here village called Siddermorton?" said the Tramp,
rising creakily to his feet and pointing to the clustering roofs
down the hill.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Angel, "they call it Siddermorton."</p>

<p>"I know it, I know it," said the Tramp. "And a very pretty
little village it is too." He stretched and yawned, and stood
regarding the place. "'Ouses," he said reflectively;
"Projuce"&mdash;waving his hand at the cornfields and orchards.
"Looks cosy, don't it?"</p>

<p>"It has a quaint beauty of its own," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"It 'as a quaint beauty of its own&mdash;yes...Lord! I'd like to
sack the blooming place...I was born there."</p>

<p>"Dear me," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was born there. Ever heard of a pithed frog?"</p>

<p>"Pithed frog," said the Angel. "No!"</p>

<p>"It's a thing these here vivisectionists do. They takes a frog
and they cuts out his brains and they shoves a bit of pith in the
place of 'em. That's a pithed frog. Well&mdash;that there village
is full of pithed human beings."</p>

<p>The Angel took it quite seriously. "Is that so?" he said.</p>

<p>"That's so&mdash;you take my word for it. Everyone of them 'as
'ad their brains cut out and chunks of rotten touchwood put in the
place of it. And you see that little red place there?"</p>

<p>"That's called the national school," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that's where they piths 'em," said the Tramp, quite
in love with his conceit.</p>

<p>"Really! That's very interesting."</p>

<p>"It stands to reason," said the Tramp. "If they 'ad brains
they'd 'ave ideas, and if they 'ad ideas they'd think for
themselves. And you can go through that village from end to end and
never meet anybody doing as much. Pithed human beings they are. I
know that village. I was born there, and I might be there now,
a-toilin' for my betters, if I 'adn't struck against the
pithin'."</p>

<p>"Is it a painful operation?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"In parts. Though it ain't the heads gets hurt. And it lasts a
long time. They take 'em young into that school, and they says to
them, 'come in 'ere and we'll improve your minds,' they says, and
in the little kiddies go as good as gold. And they begins shovin'
it into them. Bit by bit and 'ard and dry, shovin' out the nice
juicy brains. Dates and lists and things. Out they comes no brains
in their 'eads, and wound up nice and tight, ready to touch their
'ats to anyone who looks at them. Why! One touched 'is 'at to me
yesterday. And they runs about spry and does all the dirty work,
and feels thankful they're allowed to live. They take a positive
pride in 'ard work for its own sake. Arter they bin pithed. See
that chap ploughin'?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Angel; "is he pithed?"</p>

<p>"Rather. Else he'd be paddin' the hoof this pleasant
weather&mdash;like me and the blessed Apostles."</p>

<p>"I begin to understand," said the Angel, rather dubiously.</p>

<p>"I knew you would," said the Philosophical Tramp. "I thought you
was the right sort. But speaking serious, ain't it
ridiculous?&mdash;centuries and centuries of civilisation, and look
at that poor swine there, sweatin' 'isself empty and trudging up
that 'ill-side. 'E's English, 'e is. 'E belongs to the top race in
creation, 'e does. 'E's one of the rulers of Indjer. It's enough to
make a nigger laugh. The flag that's braved a thousand years the
battle an' the breeze&mdash;that's 'is flag. There never was a
country was as great and glorious as this. Never. And that's wot it
makes of us. I'll tell you a little story about them parts as you
seems to be a bit of a stranger. There's a chap called Gotch, Sir
John Gotch they calls 'im, and when 'e was a young gent from
Oxford, I was a little chap of eight and my sister was a girl of
seventeen. Their servant she was. But Lord! everybody's 'eard that
story&mdash;it's common enough, of 'im or the likes of 'im."</p>

<p>"I haven't," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"All that's pretty and lively of the gals they chucks into the
gutters, and all the men with a pennorth of spunk or adventure, all
who won't drink what the Curate's wife sends 'em instead of beer,
and touch their hats promiscous, and leave the rabbits and birds
alone for their betters, gets drove out of the villages as rough
characters. Patriotism! Talk about improvin' the race! Wot's left
ain't fit to look a nigger in the face, a Chinaman 'ud be ashamed
of 'em..."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," said the Angel. "I don't follow
you."</p>

<p>At that the Philosophic Tramp became more explicit, and told the
Angel the simple story of Sir John Gotch and the kitchen-maid. It's
scarcely necessary to repeat it. You may understand that it left
the Angel puzzled. It was full of words he did not understand, for
the only vehicle of emotion the Tramp possessed was blasphemy. Yet,
though their tongues differed so, he could still convey to the
Angel some of his own (probably unfounded) persuasion of the
injustice and cruelty of life, and the utter detestableness of Sir
John Gotch.</p>

<p>The last the Angel saw of him was his dusty black back receding
down the lane towards Iping Hanger. A pheasant appeared by the
roadside, and the Philosophical Tramp immediately caught up a stone
and sent the bird clucking with a viciously accurate shot. Then he
disappeared round the corner.</p>

<h2><a id="chap15"></a>MRS. JEHORAM'S BREADTH OF VIEW</h2>

<h3>&sect; XXXI</h3>

<p class="first">"I HEARD some one playing the fiddle in the
Vicarage, as I came by," said Mrs. Jehoram, taking her cup of tea
from Mrs. Mendham. "The Vicar plays," said Mrs. Mendham. "I have
spoken to George about it, but it's no good. I do not think a Vicar
should be allowed to do such things. It's so foreign. But there,
he..."</p>

<p>"I know, dear," said Mrs. Jehoram. "But I heard the Vicar once
at the schoolroom. I don't think this was the Vicar. It was quite
clever, some of it, quite smart, you know. And new. I was telling
dear Lady Hammergallow this morning. I fancy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The lunatic! Very likely. These half-witted people...My dear, I
don't think I shall ever forget that dreadful encounter.
Yesterday."</p>

<p>"Nor I."</p>

<p>"My poor girls! They are too shocked to say a word about it. I
was telling dear Lady Ham&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite proper of them. It was dreadful, dear. For them."</p>

<p>"And now, dear, I want you to tell me frankly&mdash;Do you
really believe that creature was a man?"</p>

<p>"You should have heard the violin."</p>

<p>"I still more than half suspect, Jessie&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mendham leant forward as if to whisper. Mrs. Jehoram helped
herself to cake.</p>

<p>"I'm sure no woman could play the violin quite like I heard it
played this morning."</p>

<p>"Of course, if you say so that settles the matter," said Mrs.
Mendham. Mrs. Jehoram was the autocratic authority in Siddermorton
upon all questions of art, music and belles-lettres. Her late
husband had been a minor poet. Then Mrs. Mendham added a judicial
"Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Mrs. Jehoram, "I'm half inclined to believe
the dear Vicar's story."</p>

<p>"How good of you, Jessie," said Mrs. Mendham. "But really, I
don't think he could have had anyone in the Vicarage before that
afternoon. I feel sure we should have heard of it. I don't see how
a strange cat could come within four miles of Siddermorton without
the report coming round to us. The people here gossip so.."</p>

<p>"I always distrust the Vicar," said Mrs. Mendham. "I know
him."</p>

<p>"Yes. But the story is plausible. If this Mr. Angel were someone
very clever and eccentric&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He would have to be very eccentric to dress as he did. There
are degrees and limits, dear."</p>

<p>"But kilts," said Mrs. Jehoram. "Are all very well in the
Highlands..."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jehoram's eyes had rested upon a black speck creeping
slowly across a patch of yellowish-green up the hill.</p>

<p>"There he goes," said Mrs. Jehoram, rising, "across the
cornfield. I'm sure that's him. I can see the hump. Unless it's a
man with a sack. Bless me, Minnie! here's an opera glass. How
convenient for peeping at the Vicarage!...Yes, it's the man. He is
a man. With such a sweet face."</p>

<p>Very unselfishly she allowed her hostess to share the opera
glass. For a minute there was a rustling silence.</p>

<p>"His dress," said Mrs. Mendham, "is quite respectable now."</p>

<p>"Quite," said Mrs. Jehoram. Pause. "He looks cross!"</p>

<p>"And his coat is dusty."</p>

<p>"He walks steadily enough," said Mrs. Mendham, "or one might
think...This hot weather..." Another pause.</p>

<p>"You see, dear," said Mrs. Jehoram, putting down the lorgnette.
"What I was going to say was, that possibly he might be a genius in
disguise."</p>

<p>"If you can call next door to nothing a disguise."</p>

<p>"No doubt it was eccentric. But I've seen children in little
blouses, not at all unlike him. So many clever people are peculiar
in their dress and manners. A genius may steal a horse where a
bank-clerk may not look over the hedge. Very possibly he's quite
well known and laughing at our Arcadian simplicity. And really it
wasn't so improper as some of these New Women bicycling costumes. I
saw one in one of the Illustrated Papers only a few days
ago&mdash;the New Budget I think&mdash;quite tights, you know,
dear. No&mdash;I cling to the genius theory. Especially after the
playing. I'm sure the creature is original. Perhaps very amusing.
In fact, I intend to ask the Vicar to introduce me."</p>

<p>"My dear!" cried Mrs. Mendham.</p>

<p>"I'm resolute," said Mrs. Jehoram.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you're rash," said Mrs. Mendham. "Geniuses and
people of that kind are all very well in London. But here&mdash;at
the Vicarage."</p>

<p>"We are going to educate the folks. I love originality. At any
rate I mean to see him."</p>

<p>"Take care you don't see too much of him," said Mrs. Mendham.
"I've heard the fashion is quite changing. I understand that some
of the very best people have decided that genius is not to be
encouraged any more. These recent scandals..."</p>

<p>"Only in literature, I can assure you, dear. In music..."</p>

<p>"Nothing you can say, my dear," said Mrs. Mendham, going off at
a tangent, "will convince me that that person's costume was not
extremely suggestive and improper."</p>

<h2><a id="chap16"></a>A TRIVIAL INCIDENT</h2>

<h3>&sect; XXXII</h3>

<p class="first">THE Angel came thoughtfully by the hedge across
the field towards the Vicarage. The rays of the setting sun shone
on his shoulders, and touched the Vicarage with gold, and blazed
like fire in all the windows. By the gate, bathed in the sunlight,
stood little Delia, the waiting maid. She stood watching him under
her hand. It suddenly came into the Angel's mind that she, at
least, was beautiful, and not only beautiful but alive and
warm.</p>

<p>She opened the gate for him and stood aside. She was sorry for
him, for her elder sister was a cripple. He bowed to her, as he
would have done to any woman, and for just one moment looked into
her face. She looked back at him and something leapt within
her.</p>

<p>The Angel made an irresolute movement. "Your eyes are very
beautiful," he said quietly, with a remote wonder in his voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir!" she said, starting back. The Angel's expression
changed to perplexity. He went on up the pathway between the
Vicar's flower-beds, and she stood with the gate held open in her
hand, staring after him. Just under the rose-twined verandah he
turned and looked at her.</p>

<p>She still stared at him for a moment, and then with a queer
gesture turned round with her back to him, shutting the gate as she
did so, and seemed to be looking down the valley towards the church
tower.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap17"></a>THE WARP AND THE WOOF OF THINGS</h2>

<h3>&sect; XXXIII</h3>

<p class="first">AT the dinner table the Angel told the Vicar the
more striking of his day's adventures.</p>

<p>"The strange thing," said the Angel, "is the readiness of you
Human Beings&mdash;the zest, with which you inflict pain. Those
boys pelting me this morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Seemed to enjoy it," said the Vicar. "I know."</p>

<p>"Yet they don't like pain," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"No," said the Vicar; "they don't like it."</p>

<p>"Then," said the Angel, "I saw some beautiful plants rising with
a spike of leaves, two this way and two that, and when I caressed
one it caused the most uncomfortable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stinging nettle!" said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"At any rate a new sort of pain. And another plant with a head
like a coronet, and richly decorated leaves, spiked and
jagged&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A thistle, possibly."</p>

<p>"And in your garden, the beautiful sweet-smelling
plant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The sweet briar," said the Vicar. "I remember."</p>

<p>"And that pink flower that sprang out of the box&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Out of the box?" said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Last night," said the Angel, "that went climbing up the
curtains&mdash;Flame!"</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;the matches and the candles! Yes," said the
Vicar.</p>

<p>"Then the animals. A dog to-day behaved most
disagreeably&mdash;. And these boys, and the way in which people
speak&mdash;. Everyone seems anxious&mdash;willing at any
rate&mdash;to give this Pain. Everyone seems busy giving
pain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or avoiding it," said the Vicar, pushing his dinner away before
him. "Yes&mdash;of course. It's fighting everywhere. The whole
living world is a battle-field&mdash;the whole world. We are driven
by Pain. Here. How it lies on the surface! This Angel sees it in a
day!"</p>

<p>"But why does everyone&mdash;everything&mdash;want to give
pain?" asked the Angel.</p>

<p>"It is not so in the Angelic Land?" said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"No," said the Angel. "Why is it so here?"</p>

<p>The Vicar wiped his lips with his napkin slowly. "It is so," he
said. "Pain," said he still more slowly, "is the warp and the woof
of this life. Do you know," he said, after a pause, "it is almost
impossible for me to imagine...a world without pain...And yet, as
you played this morning&mdash;</p>

<p>"But this world is different. It is the very reverse of an
Angelic world. Indeed, a number of people&mdash;excellent religious
people&mdash;have been so impressed by the universality of pain
that they think, after death, things will be even worse for a great
many of us. It seems to me an excessive view. But it's a deep
question. Almost beyond one's power of discussion&mdash;"</p>

<p>And incontinently the Vicar plumped into an impromptu
dissertation upon "Necessity," how things were so because they were
so, how one had to do this and that. "Even our food," said the
Vicar.</p>

<p>"What?" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Is not obtained without inflicting Pain," said the Vicar.</p>

<p>The Angel's face went so white that the Vicar checked himself
suddenly. Or he was just on the very verge of a concise explanation
of the antecedents of a leg of lamb. There was a pause.</p>

<p>"By-the-bye," said the Angel, suddenly. "Have you been pithed?
Like the common people."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap18"></a>THE ANGEL'S DEBUT</h2>

<h3>&sect; XXXIV</h3>

<p class="first">WHEN Lady Hammergallow made up her mind, things
happened as she resolved. And though the Vicar made a spasmodic
protest, she carried out her purpose and got audience, Angel, and
violin together, at Siddermorton House before the week was out. "A
genius the Vicar has discovered," she said; so with eminent
foresight putting any possibility of blame for a failure on the
Vicar's shoulders. "The dear Vicar tells me," she would say, and
proceed to marvellous anecdotes of the Angel's cleverness with his
instrument. But she was quite in love with her idea&mdash;she had
always had a secret desire to play the patroness to obscure talent.
Hitherto it had not turned out to be talent when it came to the
test.</p>

<p>"It would be such a good thing for him," she said. "His hair is
long already, and with that high colour he would be beautiful,
simply beautiful on a platform. The Vicar's clothes fitting him so
badly makes him look quite like a fashionable pianist already. And
the scandal of his birth&mdash;not told, of course, but
whispered&mdash;would be quite an Inducement&mdash;when he gets to
London, that is."</p>

<p>The Vicar had the most horrible sensations as the day
approached. He spent hours trying to explain the situation to the
Angel, other hours trying to imagine what people would think, still
worse hours trying to anticipate the Angel's behaviour. Hitherto
the angel had always played for his own satisfaction. The Vicar
would startle him every now and then by rushing upon him with some
new point of etiquette that had just occurred to him. As for
instance: "It's very important where you put your hat, you know.
Don't put it on a chair, whatever you do. Hold it until you get
your tea, you know, and then&mdash;let me see&mdash;then put it
down somewhere, you know." The journey to Siddermorton House was
accomplished without misadventure, but at the moment of
introduction the Vicar had a spasm of horrible misgivings. He had
forgotten to explain introductions. The Angel's naive amusement was
evident, but nothing very terrible happened.</p>

<p>"Rummy looking greaser," said Mr. Rathbone-Slater, who devoted
considerable attention to costume. "Wants grooming. No manners.
Grinned when he saw me shaking hands. Did it chic enough, I
thought."</p>

<p>One trivial incident occurred. When Lady Hammergallow welcomed
the Angel she looked at him through her glasses. The apparent size
of her eyes startled him. His surprise and his quick attempt to
peer over the brims was only too evident. But the Vicar had warned
him of the ear-trumpet.</p>

<p>The Angel's incapacity to sit on anything but a music stool
appeared to excite some interest among the ladies, but led to no
remarks. They regarded it perhaps as the affectation of a budding
professional. He was remiss with the teacups and scattered the
crumbs of his cake abroad. (You must remember he was quite an
amateur at eating.) He crossed his legs. He fumbled over the hat
business after vainly trying to catch the Vicar's eye. The eldest
Miss Papaver tried to talk to him about continental watering places
and cigarettes, and formed a low opinion of his intelligence.</p>

<p>The Angel was surprised by the production of an easel and
several books of music, and a little unnerved at first by the sight
of Lady Hammergallow sitting with her head on one side, watching
him with those magnified eyes through her gilt glasses.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jehoram came up to him before he began to play and asked
him the Name of the Charming Piece he was playing the other
afternoon. The Angel said it had no name, and Mrs. Jehoram thought
music ought never to have any names and wanted to know who it was
by, and when the Angel told her he played it out of his head, she
said he must be Quite a Genius and looked open (and indisputably
fascinating) admiration at him. The Curate from Iping Hanger (who
was professionally a Kelt and who played the piano and talked
colour and music with an air of racial superiority) watched him
jealously.</p>

<p>The Vicar, who was presently captured and set down next to Lady
Hammergallow, kept an anxious eye ever Angelward while she told him
particulars of the incomes made by violinists&mdash;particulars
which, for the most part, she invented as she went along. She had
been a little ruffled by the incident of the glasses, but had
decided that it came within the limits of permissible
originality.</p>

<p>So figure to yourself the Green Saloon at Siddermorton Park; an
Angel thinly disguised in clerical vestments and with a violin in
his hands, standing by the grand piano, and a respectable gathering
of quiet nice people, nicely dressed, grouped about the room.
Anticipatory gabble&mdash;one hears scattered fragments of
conversation.</p>

<p>"He is incog"; said the very eldest Miss Papaver to Mrs.
Pirbright. "Isn't it quaint and delicious. Jessica Jehoram says she
saw him at Vienna, but she can't remember the name. The Vicar knows
all about him, but he is so close&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How hot and uncomfortable the dear Vicar is looking," said Mrs.
Pirbright. "I've noticed it before when he sits next to Lady
Hammergallow. She simply will not respect his cloth. She goes
on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His tie is all askew," said the very eldest Miss Papaver, "and
his hair! It really hardly looks as though he had brushed it all
day."</p>

<p>"Looks a foreign sort of chap. Affected. All very well in a
drawing-room," said George Harringay, sitting apart with the
younger Miss Pirbright. "But for my part give me a masculine man
and a feminine woman. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;I think so too," said the younger Miss Pirbright.</p>

<p>"Guineas and guineas," said Lady Hammergallow. "I've heard that
some of them keep quite stylish establishments. You would scarcely
credit it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I love music, Mr. Angel, I adore it. It stirs something in me.
I can scarcely describe it," said Mrs. Jehoram. "Who is it says
that delicious antithesis: Life without music is brutality; music
without life is&mdash;Dear me! perhaps you remember? Music without
life&mdash;it's Ruskin I think?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry that I do not," said the Angel. "I have read very few
books."</p>

<p>"How charming of you!" said Mrs. Jehoram. "I wish I didn't. I
sympathise with you profoundly. I would do the same, only we poor
women&mdash;I suppose it's originality we lack&mdash;And down here
one is driven to the most desperate proceedings&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's certainly very pretty. But the ultimate test of a man is
his strength," said George Harringay. "What do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;I think so too," said the younger Miss Pirbright.</p>

<p>"It's the effeminate man who makes the masculine woman. When the
glory of a man is his hair, what's a woman to do? And when men go
running about with beautiful hectic dabs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh George! You are so dreadfully satirical to-day," said the
younger Miss Pirbright. "I'm sure it isn't paint."</p>

<p>"I'm really not his guardian, my dear Lady Hammergallow. Of
course it's very kind indeed of you to take such an
interest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you really going to improvise?" said Mrs. Jehoram in a
state of cooing delight.</p>

<p>"SSsh!" said the Curate from Iping Hanger.</p>

<p>Then the Angel began to play, looking straight before him as he
did so, thinking of the wonderful things of the Angelic Land, and
insensibly letting the sadness he was beginning to feel, steal over
the fantasia he was playing. When he forgot his company the music
was strange and sweet; when the sense of his surroundings floated
into his mind the music grew capricious and grotesque. Mrs. Jehoram
sat and looked rapt and sympathetic as hard as she could (though
the music was puzzling at times) and tried to catch his eye. He
really had a wonderfully expressive face, and the tenderest shades
of expression! And Mrs. Jehoram was a judge. George Harringay
looked bored, until the younger Miss Pirbright, who adored him, put
out her mousy little shoe to touch his manly boot, and then he
turned his face to catch the feminine delicacy of her coquettish
eye, and so was comforted. The very eldest Miss Papaver and Mrs.
Pirbright sat quite still and looked churchy for nearly four
minutes.</p>

<p>Then said the eldest Miss Papaver in a whisper, "I always Enjoy
violin music so much." And Mrs. Pirbright answered, "We get so
little Nice music down here." And Miss Papaver said, "He plays Very
nicely." And Mrs. Pirbright, "Such a Delicate Touch!" And Miss
Papaver, "Does Willie keep up his lessons?" and so to a whispered
conversation.</p>

<p>The Curate from Iping Hanger sat (he felt) in full view of the
company. He had one hand curled round his ear, and his eyes hard
and staring fixedly at the pedestal of the Hammergallow
S&egrave;vres vase. He supplied, by the movements of his mouth, a
kind of critical guide to any of the company who were disposed to
avail themselves of it. It was a generous way he had. His aspect
was severely judicial, tempered by starts of evident disapproval
and guarded appreciation. The Vicar leaned back in his chair and
stared at the Angel's face, and was presently rapt away in a
wonderful dream. Lady Hammergallow, with quick jerky movements of
the head and a low but insistent rustling, surveyed and tried to
judge of the effect of the Angelic playing. Mr. Rathbone-Slater
stared very solemnly into his hat and looked very miserable, and
Mrs. Rathbone-Slater made mental memoranda of Mrs. Jehoram's
sleeves. And the air about them all was heavy with exquisite
music&mdash;for all that had ears to hear.</p>

<p>"Scarcely affected enough," whispered Lady Hammergallow
hoarsely, suddenly poking the Vicar in the ribs. The Vicar came out
of Dreamland suddenly.</p>

<p>"Eigh?" shouted the Vicar, startled, coming up with a jump.</p>

<p>"Sssh!" said the Curate from Iping Hanger, and everyone looked
shocked at the brutal insensibility of Hilyer.</p>

<p>"So unusual of the Vicar," said the very eldest Miss Papaver,
"to do things like that!"</p>

<p>The Angel went on playing.</p>

<p>The Curate from Iping Hanger began making mesmeric movements
with his index finger, and as the thing proceeded Mr.
Rathbone-Slater got amazingly limp. He solemnly turned his hat
round and altered his view. The Vicar lapsed from an uneasy
discomfort into dreamland again. Lady Hammergallow rustled a great
deal, and presently found a way of making her chair creak. And at
last the thing came to an end. Lady Hammergallow exclaimed
"De-licious!" though she had never heard a note, and began clapping
her hands. At that everyone clapped except Mr. Rathbone-Slater, who
rapped his hat brim instead. The Curate from Iping Hanger clapped
with a judicial air.</p>

<p>"So I said (clap, clap, clap), if you cannot cook the food my
way (clap, clap, clap) you must go," said Mrs. Pirbright, clapping
vigorously. "(This music is a delightful treat.)"</p>

<p>"(It is. I always revel in music,)" said the very eldest Miss
Papaver. "And did she improve after that?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said Mrs. Pirbright.</p>

<p>The Vicar woke up again and stared round the saloon. Did other
people see these visions, or were they confined to him alone?
Surely they must all see...and have a wonderful command of their
feelings. It was incredible that such music should not affect them.
"He's a trifle gauche," said Lady Hammergallow, jumping upon the
Vicar's attention. "He neither bows nor smiles. He must cultivate
oddities like that. Every successful executant is more or less
gauche."</p>

<p>"Did you really make that up yourself?" said Mrs. Jehoram,
sparkling her eyes at him, "as you went along. Really, it is
wonderful! Nothing less than wonderful."</p>

<p>"A little amateurish," said the Curate from Iping Hanger to Mr.
Rathbone-Slater. "A great gift, undoubtedly, but a certain lack of
sustained training. There were one or two little things...I would
like to talk to him."</p>

<p>"His trousers look like concertinas," said Mr. Rathbone-Slater.
"He ought to be told that. It's scarcely decent."</p>

<p>"Can you do Imitations, Mr. Angel?" said Lady Hammergallow.</p>

<p>"Oh do, do some Imitations!" said Mrs. Jehoram. "I adore
Imitations."</p>

<p>"It was a fantastic thing," said the Curate of Iping Hanger to
the Vicar of Siddermorton, waving his long indisputably musical
hands as he spoke; "a little involved, to my mind. I have heard it
before somewhere&mdash;I forget where. He has genius undoubtedly,
but occasionally he is&mdash;loose. There is a certain deadly
precision wanting. There are years of discipline yet."</p>

<p>"I don't admire these complicated pieces of music," said George
Harringay. "I have simple tastes, I'm afraid. There seems to me no
tune in it. There's nothing I like so much as simple music. Tune,
simplicity is the need of the age, in my opinion. We are so over
subtle. Everything is far-fetched. Home-grown thoughts and 'Home,
Sweet Home' for me. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I think so&mdash;quite," said the younger Miss
Pirbright.</p>

<p>"Well, Amy, chattering to George as usual?" said Mrs. Pirbright,
across the room.</p>

<p>"As usual, Ma!" said the younger Miss Pirbright, glancing round
with a bright smile at Miss Papaver, and turning again so as not to
lose the next utterance from George.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you and Mr. Angel could manage a duet?" said Lady
Hammergallow to the Curate from Iping Hanger, who was looking
preternaturally gloomy.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I should be delighted," said the Curate from Iping
Hanger, brightening up.</p>

<p>"Duets!" said the Angel; "the two of us. Then he can play. I
understood&mdash;the Vicar told me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilmerdings is an accomplished pianist," interrupted the
Vicar.</p>

<p>"But the Imitations?" said Mrs. Jehoram, who detested
Wilmerdings.</p>

<p>"Imitations!" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"A pig squeaking, a cock crowing, you know," said Mr.
Rathbone-Slater, and added lower, "Best fun you can get out of a
fiddle&mdash;my opinion."</p>

<p>"I really don't understand," said the Angel. "A pig
crowing!"</p>

<p>"You don't like Imitations," said Mrs. Jehoram. "Nor do I
really. I accept the snub. I think they degrade..."</p>

<p>"Perhaps afterwards Mr. Angel will Relent," said Lady
Hammergallow, when Mrs. Pirbright had explained the matter to her.
She could scarcely credit her ear-trumpet. When she asked for
Imitations she was accustomed to get Imitations.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilmerdings had seated himself at the piano, and had turned
to a familiar pile of music in the recess. "What do you think of
that Bar-carole thing of Spohr's?" he said over his shoulder. "I
suppose you know it?" The Angel looked bewildered.</p>

<p>He opened the folio before the Angel.</p>

<p>"What an odd kind of book!" said the Angel. "What do all those
crazy dots mean?" (At that the Vicar's blood ran cold.)</p>

<p>"What dots?" said the Curate.</p>

<p>"There!" said the Angel with incriminating finger.</p>

<p>"Oh come!" said the Curate.</p>

<p>There was one of those swift, short silences that mean so much
in a social gathering.</p>

<p>Then the eldest Miss Papaver turned upon the Vicar. "Does not
Mr. Angel play from ordinary...Music&mdash;from the ordinary
notation?"</p>

<p>"I have never heard," said the Vicar, getting red now after the
first shock of horror. "I have really never seen..."</p>

<p>The Angel felt the situation was strained, though what was
straining it he could not understand. He became aware of a
doubtful, an unfriendly look upon the faces that regarded him.
"Impossible!" he heard Mrs. Pirbright say; "after that beautiful
music." The eldest Miss Papaver went to Lady Hammergallow at once,
and began to explain into her ear-trumpet that Mr. Angel did not
wish to play with Mr. Wilmerdings, and alleged an ignorance of
written music.</p>

<p>"He cannot play from Notes!" said Lady Hammergallow in a voice
of measured horror. "Non-sense!"</p>

<p>"Notes!" said the Angel perplexed. "Are these notes?" asked the
Angel.</p>

<p>"It's carrying the joke too far&mdash;simply because he doesn't
want to play with Wilmerdings," said Mr. Rathbone-Slater to George
Harringay.</p>

<p>There was an expectant pause. The Angel perceived he had to be
ashamed of himself. He was ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>"Then," said Lady Hammergallow, throwing her head back and
speaking with deliberate indignation, as she rustled forward, "if
you cannot play with Mr. Wilmerdings I am afraid I cannot ask you
to play again." She made it sound like an ultimatum. Her glasses in
her hand quivered violently with indignation. The Angel was now
human enough to appreciate the fact that he was crushed.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said little Lucy Rustchuck in the further bay.</p>

<p>"He's refused to play with old Wilmerdings," said Tommy
Rathbone-Slater. "What a lark! The old girl's purple. She thinks
heaps of that ass, Wilmerdings."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Mr. Wilmerdings, you will favour us with that
delicious Polonaise of Chopin's," said Lady Hammergallow. Everybody
else was hushed. The indignation of Lady Hammergallow inspired much
the same silence as a coming earthquake or an eclipse. Mr.
Wilmerdings perceived he would be doing a real social service to
begin at once, and (be it entered to his credit now that his
account draws near its settlement) he did.</p>

<p>"If a man pretend to practise an Art," said George Harringay,
"he ought at least to have the conscience to study the elements of
it. What do you..."</p>

<p>"Oh! I think so too," said the youngest Miss Pirbright.</p>

<p>The Vicar felt that the heavens had fallen. He sat crumpled up
in his chair, a shattered man. Lady Hammergallow sat down next to
him without appearing to see him. She was breathing heavily, but
her face was terribly calm. Everyone sat down. Was the Angel
grossly ignorant or only grossly impertinent? The Angel was vaguely
aware of some frightful offence, aware that in some mysterious way
he had ceased to be the centre of the gathering. He saw reproachful
despair in the Vicar's eye. He drifted slowly towards the window in
the recess and sat down on the little octagonal Moorish stool by
the side of Mrs. Jehoram. And under the circumstances he
appreciated at more than its proper value Mrs. Jehoram's kindly
smile. He put down the violin in the window seat.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XXXV</h3>

<p class="first">Mrs. Jehoram and the Angel (apart)&mdash;Mr.
Wilmerdings playing.</p>

<p>"I have so longed for a quiet word with you," said Mrs. Jehoram
in a low tone. "To tell you how delightful I found your
playing."</p>

<p>"I am glad it pleased you," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Pleased is scarcely the word," said Mrs. Jehoram. "I was
moved&mdash;profoundly. These others did not understand...I was
glad you did not play with him."</p>

<p>The Angel looked at the mechanism called Wilmerdings, and felt
glad too. (The Angelic conception of duets is a kind of
conversation upon violins.) But he said nothing.</p>

<p>"I worship music," said Mrs. Jehoram. "I know nothing about it
technically, but there is something in it a longing, a wish..."</p>

<p>The Angel stared at her face. She met his eyes.</p>

<p>"You understand," she said. "I see you understand." He was
certainly a very nice boy, sentimentally precocious perhaps, and
with deliciously liquid eyes.</p>

<p>There was an interval of Chopin (Op. 40) played with immense
precision.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jehoram had a sweet face still, in shadow, with the light
falling round her golden hair, and a curious theory flashed across
the Angel's mind. The perceptible powder only supported his view of
something infinitely bright and lovable caught, tarnished,
coarsened, coated over.</p>

<p>"Do you," said the Angel in a low tone. "Are you...separated
from...your world?"</p>

<p>"As you are?" whispered Mrs. Jehoram.</p>

<p>"This is so&mdash;cold," said the Angel. "So harsh!" He meant
the whole world.</p>

<p>"I feel it too," said Mrs. Jehoram, referring to Siddermorton
Home.</p>

<p>"There are those who cannot live without sympathy," she said
after a sympathetic pause. "And times when one feels alone in the
world. Fighting a battle against it all. Laughing, flirting, hiding
the pain of it..."</p>

<p>"And hoping," said the Angel with a wonderful
glance.&mdash;"Yes."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jehoram (who was an epicure of flirtations) felt the Angel
was more than redeeming the promise of his appearance.
(Indisputably he worshipped her.) "Do you look for sympathy?" she
said. "Or have you found it?"</p>

<p>"I think," said the Angel, very softly, leaning forward, "I
think I have found it."</p>

<p>Interval of Chopin Op. 40. The very eldest Miss Papaver and Mrs.
Pirbright whispering. Lady Hammergallow (glasses up) looking down
the saloon with an unfriendly expression at the Angel. Mrs. Jehoram
and the Angel exchanging deep and significant glances.</p>

<p>"Her name," said the Angel (Mrs. Jehoram made a movement), "is
Delia. She is..."</p>

<p>"Delia!" said Mrs. Jehoram sharply, suddenly realising a
terrible misunderstanding. "A fanciful name...Why!...No! Not that
little housemaid at the Vicarage&mdash;?..."</p>

<p>The Polonaise terminated with a flourish. The Angel was quite
surprised at the change in Mrs. Jehoram's expression.</p>

<p>"I never did!" said Mrs. Jehoram, recovering. "To make me your
confidant in an intrigue with a servant. Really, Mr. Angel, it's
possible to be too original..."</p>

<p>Then suddenly their colloquy was interrupted.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XXXVI</h3>

<p class="first">This section is (so far as my memory goes) the
shortest in the book.</p>

<p>But the enormity of the offence necessitates the separation of
this section from all other sections.</p>

<p>The Vicar, you must understand, had done his best to inculcate
the recognised differentiae of a gentleman. "Never allow a lady to
carry anything," said the Vicar. "Say, 'permit me' and relieve
her."</p>

<p>"Always stand until every lady is seated."</p>

<p>"Always rise and open a door for a lady..." and so forth. (All
men who have elder sisters know that code.)</p>

<p>And the Angel (who had failed to relieve Lady Hammergallow of
her teacup) danced forward with astonishing dexterity (leaving Mrs.
Jehoram in the window seat) and with an elegant "permit me" rescued
the tea-tray from Lady Hammergallow's pretty parlour-maid and
vanished officiously in front of her. The Vicar rose to his feet
with an inarticulate cry.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XXXVII</h3>

<p class="first">"He's drunk!" said Mr. Rathbone-Slater, breaking a
terrific silence. "That's the matter with him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jehoram laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>The Vicar stood up, motionless, staring. "Oh! I forgot to
explain servants to him!" said the Vicar to himself in a swift
outbreak of remorse. "I thought he did understand servants."</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Hilyer!" said Lady Hammergallow, evidently
exercising enormous self-control and speaking in panting spasms.
"Really, Mr. Hilyer!&mdash;Your genius is too terrible. I must, I
really must, ask you to take him home."</p>

<p>So to the dialogue in the corridor of alarmed maid-servant and
well-meaning (but shockingly gauche) Angel appears the Vicar, his
botryoidal little face crimson, gaunt despair in his eyes, and his
necktie under his left ear.</p>

<p>"Come," he said struggling with emotion. "Come away...I...I am
disgraced for ever."</p>

<p>And the Angel stared for a second at him and
obeyed&mdash;meekly, perceiving himself in the presence of unknown
but evidently terrible forces.</p>

<p>And so began and ended the Angel's social career.</p>

<p>In the informal indignation meeting that followed, Lady
Hammergallow took the (informal) chair. "I feel humiliated," she
said. "The Vicar assured me he was an exquisite player. I never
imagined..."</p>

<p>"He was drunk," said Mr. Rathbone-Slater. "You could tell it
from the way he fumbled with his tea."</p>

<p>"Such a fiasco!" said Mrs. Mergle.</p>

<p>"The Vicar assured me," said Lady Hammergallow. "'The man I have
staying with me is a musical genius,' he said. His very words."</p>

<p>"His ears must be burning anyhow," said Tommy
Rathbone-Slater.</p>

<p>"I was trying to keep him Quiet," said Mrs. Jehoram. "By
humouring him. And do you know the things he said to
me&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>"The thing he played," said Mr. Wilmerdings, "&mdash;I must
confess I did not like to charge him to his face. But really! It
was merely drifting."</p>

<p>"Just fooling with a fiddle, eigh?" said George Harringay.
"Well, I thought it was beyond me. So much of your fine music
is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, George!" said the youngest Miss Pirbright.</p>

<p>"The Vicar was a bit on too&mdash;to judge by his tie," said Mr.
Rathbone-Slater. "It's a dashed nimmy go. Did you notice how he
fussed after the genius?"</p>

<p>"One has to be so very careful," said the very eldest Miss
Papaver.</p>

<p>"He told me he is in love with the Vicar's housemaid!" said Mrs.
Jehoram. "I almost laughed in his face."</p>

<p>"The Vicar ought never to have brought him here," said Mrs.
Rathbone-Slater with decision.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap19"></a>THE TROUBLE OF THE BARBED WIRE</h2>

<h3>&sect; XXXVIII</h3>

<p class="first">SO, ingloriously, ended the Angel's first and last
appearance in Society. Vicar and Angel returned to the Vicarage;
crestfallen black figures in the bright sunlight, going dejectedly.
The Angel, deeply pained that the Vicar was pained. The Vicar,
dishevelled and desperate, intercalating spasmodic remorse and
apprehension with broken explanations of the Theory of Etiquette.
"They do not understand," said the Vicar over and over again. "They
will all be so very much aggrieved. I do not know what to say to
them. It is all so confused, so perplexing." And at the gate of the
Vicarage, at the very spot where Delia had first seemed beautiful,
stood Horrocks, the village constable, awaiting them. He held
coiled up about his hand certain short lengths of barbed wire.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Horrocks," said the Vicar as the constable held
the gate open.</p>

<p>"Evening Sir," said Horrocks, and added in a kind of mysterious
undertone, "Could I speak to you a minute, Sir?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the Vicar. The Angel walked on thoughtfully to
the house, and meeting Delia in the hall stopped her and
cross-examined her at length over differences between Servants and
Ladies.</p>

<p>"You'll excuse my taking the liberty, Sir," said Horrocks, "but
there's trouble brewin' for that crippled gent you got stayin'
here."</p>

<p>"Bless me!" said the Vicar. "You don't say so!"</p>

<p>"Sir John Gotch, Sir. He's very angry indeed, Sir. His language,
Sir&mdash;. But I felt bound to tell you, Sir. He's certain set on
taking out a summons on account of that there barbed wire. Certain
set, Sir, he is."</p>

<p>"Sir John Gotch!" said the Vicar. "Wire! I don't
understand."</p>

<p>"He asked me to find out who did it. Course I've had to do my
duty, Sir. Naturally a disagreeable one."</p>

<p>"Barbed wire! Duty! I don't understand you, Horrocks."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, Sir, there's no denying the evidence. I've made
careful enquiries, Sir." And forthwith the constable began telling
the Vicar of a new and terrible outrage committed by the Angelic
visitor.</p>

<p>But we need not follow that explanation in detail&mdash;or the
subsequent confession. (For my own part I think there is nothing
more tedious than dialogue.) It gave the Vicar a new view of the
Angelic character, a vignette of the Angelic indignation. A shady
lane, sun-mottled, sweet hedges full of honeysuckle and vetch on
either side, and a little girl gathering flowers, forgetful of the
barbed wire which, all along the Sidderford Road, fenced in the
dignity of Sir John Gotch from "bounders" and the detested
"million." Then suddenly a gashed hand, a bitter outcry, and the
Angel sympathetic, comforting, inquisitive. Explanations sob-set,
and then&mdash;altogether novel phenomenon in the Angelic
career&mdash;passion. A furious onslaught upon the barbed wire of
Sir John Gotch, barbed wire recklessly handled, slashed, bent and
broken. Yet the Angel acted without personal malice&mdash;saw in
the thing only an ugly and vicious plant that trailed insidiously
among its fellows. Finally the Angel's explanations gave the Vicar
a picture of the Angel alone amidst his destruction, trembling and
amazed at the sudden force, not himself, that had sprung up within
him, and set him striking and cutting. Amazed, too, at the crimson
blood that trickled down his fingers.</p>

<p>"It is still more horrible," said the Angel when the Vicar had
explained the artificial nature of the thing. "If I had seen the
man who put this silly-cruel stuff there to hurt little children, I
know I should have tried to inflict pain upon him. I have never
felt like this before. I am indeed becoming tainted and coloured
altogether by the wickedness of this world.</p>

<p>"To think, too, that you men should be so foolish as to combine
to uphold a law that lets a man do such spiteful things. Yes I
know; you will say it has to be so. For some remoter reason. That
is a thing that only makes me angrier. Why cannot an act rest on
its own merits?...As it does in the Angelic Land."</p>

<p>That was the incident the history of which the Vicar now
gradually learnt, getting the bare outline from Horrocks, the
colour and emotion subsequently from the Angel. The thing had
happened the day before the musical festival at Siddermorton
House.</p>

<p>"Have you told Sir John who did it?" asked the Vicar. "And are
you sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure, Sir. There can be no doubting it was your
gentleman, Sir. I've not told Sir John yet, Sir. But I shall have
to tell Sir John this evening. Meaning no offence to you, Sir, as I
hopes you'll see. It's my duty, Sir. Besides which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," said the Vicar, hastily. "Certainly it's your duty.
And what will Sir John do?"</p>

<p>"He's dreadful set against the person who did
it&mdash;destroying property like that&mdash;and sort of slapping
his arrangements in the face."</p>

<p>Pause. Horrocks made a movement. The Vicar, tie almost at the
back of his neck now, a most unusual thing for him, stared blankly
at his toes.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd tell you, Sir," said Horrocks.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Vicar. "Thanks, Horrocks, thanks!" He scratched
the back of his head. "You might perhaps...I think it's the best
way...Quite sure Mr. Angel did it?"</p>

<p>"Sherlock 'Omes, Sir, couldn't be cocksurer."</p>

<p>"Then I'd better give you a little note to the Squire."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XXXIX</h3>

<p class="first">The Vicar's table-talk at dinner that night, after
the Angel had stated his case, was full of grim explanations,
prisons, madness.</p>

<p>"It's too late to tell the truth about you now," said the Vicar.
"Besides, that's impossible. I really do not know what to say. We
must face our circumstances, I suppose. I am so undecided&mdash;so
torn. It's the two worlds. If your Angelic world were only a dream,
or if this world were only a dream&mdash;or if I could believe
either or both dreams, it would be all right with me. But here is a
real Angel and a real summons&mdash;how to reconcile them I do not
know. I must talk to Gotch...But he won't understand. Nobody will
understand..."</p>

<p>"I am putting you to terrible inconvenience, I am afraid. My
appalling unworldliness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's not you," said the Vicar. "It's not you. I perceive you
have brought something strange and beautiful into my life. It's not
you. It's myself. If I had more faith either way. If I could
believe entirely in this world, and call you an Abnormal
Phenomenon, as Crump does. But no. Terrestrial Angelic, Angelic
Terrestrial...See-Saw."</p>

<p>"Still, Gotch is certain to be disagreeable, most disagreeable.
He always is. It puts me into his hands. He is a bad moral
influence, I know. Drinking. Gambling. Worse. Still, one must
render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's. And he is against
Disestablishment..."</p>

<p>Then the Vicar would revert to the social collapse of the
afternoon. "You are so very fundamental, you know," he
said&mdash;several times.</p>

<p>The Angel went to his own room puzzled but very depressed. Every
day the world had frowned darker upon him and his angelic ways. He
could see how the trouble affected the Vicar, yet he could not
imagine how he could avert it. It was all so strange and
unreasonable. Twice again, too, he had been pelted out of the
village.</p>

<p>He found the violin lying on his bed where he had laid it before
dinner. And taking it up he began to play to comfort himself. But
now he played no delicious vision of the Angelic Land. The iron of
the world was entering into his soul. For a week now he had known
pain and rejection, suspicion and hatred; a strange new spirit of
revolt was growing up in his heart. He played a melody, still sweet
and tender as those of the Angelic Land, but charged with a new
note, the note of human sorrow and effort, now swelling into
something like defiance, dying now into a plaintive sadness. He
played softly, playing to himself to comfort himself, but the Vicar
heard, and all his finite bothers were swallowed up in a hazy
melancholy, a melancholy that was somehow quite remote from sorrow.
And besides the Vicar, the Angel had another hearer of whom neither
Angel nor Vicar was thinking.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap20"></a>DELIA</h2>

<h3>&sect; XL</h3>

<p class="first">SHE was only four or five yards away from the
Angel in the westward gable. The diamond-paned window of her little
white room was open. She knelt on her box of japanned tin, and
rested her chin on her hands, her elbows on the window-sill. The
young moon hung over the pine trees, and its light, cool and
colourless, lay softly upon the silent-sleeping world. Its light
fell upon her white face, and discovered new depths in her dreaming
eyes. Her soft lips fell apart and showed the little white
teeth.</p>

<p>Delia was thinking vaguely, wonderfully, as girls will think. It
was feeling rather than thinking; clouds of beautiful translucent
emotion drove across the clear sky of her mind, taking shape that
changed and vanished. She had all that wonderful emotional
tenderness, that subtle exquisite desire for self-sacrifice, which
exists so inexplicably in a girl's heart, exists it seems only to
be presently trampled under foot by the grim and gross humours of
daily life, to be ploughed in again roughly and remorselessly, as
the farmer ploughs in the clover again that has sprung up in the
soil. She had been looking out at the tranquillity of the moonlight
long before the Angel began to play,&mdash;waiting; then suddenly
the quiet, motionless beauty of silver and shadow was suffused with
tender music.</p>

<p>She did not move, but her lips closed and her eyes grew even
softer. She had been thinking before of the strange glory that had
suddenly flashed out about the stooping hunchback when he spoke to
her in the sunset; of that and of a dozen other glances, chance
turns, even once the touching of her hand. That afternoon he had
spoken to her, asking strange questions. Now the music seemed to
bring his very face before her, his look of half curious
solicitude, peering into her face, into her eyes, into her and
through her, deep down into her soul. He seemed now to be speaking
directly to her, telling her of his solitude and trouble. Oh! that
regret, that longing! For he was in trouble. And how could a
servant-girl help him, this soft-spoken gentleman who carried
himself so kindly, who played so sweetly. The music was so sweet
and keen, it came so near to the thought of her heart, that
presently one band tightened on the other, and the tears came
streaming down her face.</p>

<p>As Crump would tell you, people do not do that kind of thing
unless there is something wrong with the nervous system. But then,
from the scientific point of view, being in love is a pathological
condition.</p>

<p>I am painfully aware of the objectionable nature of my story
here. I have even thought of wilfully perverting the truth to
propitiate the Lady Reader. But I could not. The story has been too
much for me. I do the thing with my eyes open. Delia must remain
what she really was&mdash;a servant-girl. I know that to give a
mere servant-girl, or at least an English servant-girl, the refined
feelings of a human being, to present her as speaking with anything
but an intolerable confusion of aspirates, places me outside the
pale of respectable writers. Association with servants, even in
thought, is dangerous in these days. I can only plead (pleading
vainly, I know), that Delia was a very exceptional servant-girl.
Possibly, if one enquired, it might be found that her parentage was
upper middle-class&mdash;that she was made of the finer upper
middle-class clay. And (this perhaps may avail me better) I will
promise that in some future work I will redress the balance, and
the patient reader shall have the recognised article, enormous feet
and hands, systematic aspiration of vowels and elimination of
aspirates, no figure (only middle-class girls have
figures&mdash;the thing is beyond a servant-girl's means), a fringe
(by agreement), and a cheerful readiness to dispose of her
self-respect for half-a-crown. That is the accepted English
servant, the typical English woman (when stripped of money and
accomplishments) as she appears in the works of contemporary
writers. But Delia somehow was different. I can only regret the
circumstance&mdash;it was altogether beyond my control.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap21"></a>DOCTOR CRUMP ACTS</h2>

<h3>&sect; XLI</h3>

<p class="first">EARLY the next morning the Angel went down through
the village, and climbing the fence, waded through the waist-high
reeds that fringe the Sidder. He was going to Bandram Bay to take a
nearer view of the sea, which one could just see on a clear day
from the higher parts of Siddermorton Park. And suddenly he came
upon Crump sitting on a log and smoking. (Crump always smoked
exactly two ounces per week and he always smoked it in the open
air.)</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Crump, in his healthiest tone. "How's the
wing?"</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Angel. "The pain's gone."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know you are trespassing?"</p>

<p>"Trespassing!" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't know what that means," said Crump.</p>

<p>"I don't," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"I must congratulate you. I don't know how long you will last,
but you are keeping it up remarkably well. I thought at first you
were a mattoid, but you're so amazingly consistent. Your attitude
of entire ignorance of the elementary facts of Life is really a
very amusing pose. You make slips of course, but very few. But
surely we two understand one another."</p>

<p>He smiled at the Angel. "You would beat Sherlock Holmes. I
wonder who you really are."</p>

<p>The Angel smiled back, with eyebrows raised and hands extended.
"It's impossible for you to know who I am. Your eyes are blind,
your ears deaf, your soul dark, to all that is wonderful about me.
It's no good my telling that I fell into your world."</p>

<p>The Doctor waved his pipe. "Not that, please. I don't want to
pry if you have your reasons for keeping quiet. Only I would like
you to think of Hilyer's mental health. He really believes this
story."</p>

<p>The Angel shrugged his dwindling wings.</p>

<p>"You did not know him before this affair. He's changed
tremendously. He used to be neat and comfortable. For the last
fortnight he's been hazy, with a far-away look in his eyes. He
preached last Sunday without his cuff links, and something wrong
with his tie, and he took for his text, 'Eye hath not seen nor ear
heard.' He really believes all this nonsense about the Angel-land.
The man is verging on monomania!"</p>

<p>"You will see things from your own stand-point," said the
Angel.</p>

<p>"Every one must. At any rate, I think it jolly regrettable to
see this poor old fellow hypnotised, as you certainly have
hypnotised him. I don't know where you come from nor who you are,
but I warn you I'm not going to see the old boy made a fool of much
longer."</p>

<p>"But he's not being made a fool of. He's simply beginning to
dream of a world outside his knowledge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It won't do," said Crump. "I'm not one of the dupe class. You
are either of two things&mdash;a lunatic at large (which I don't
believe), or a knave. Nothing else is possible. I think I know a
little of this world, whatever I do of yours. Very well. If you
don't leave Hillyer alone I shall communicate with the police, and
either clap you into a prison, if you go back on your story, or
into a madhouse if you don't. It's stretching a point, but I swear
I'd certify you insane to-morrow to get you out of the village.
It's not only the Vicar. As you know. I hope that's plain. Now what
have you to say?"</p>

<p>With an affectation of great calm, the Doctor took out his
penknife and began to dig the blade into his pipe bowl. His pipe
had gone out during this last speech.</p>

<p>For a moment neither spoke. The Angel looked about him with a
face that grew pale. The Doctor extracted a plug of tobacco from
his pipe and flung it away, shut his penknife and put it in his
waistcoat pocket. He had not meant to speak quite so emphatically,
but speech always warmed him.</p>

<p>"Prison," said the Angel. "Madhouse! Let me see." Then he
remembered the Vicar's explanation. "Not that!" he said. He
approached Crump with eyes dilated and hands outstretched.</p>

<p>"I knew you would know what those things meant at any rate. Sit
down," said Crump, indicating the tree trunk beside him by a
movement of the head.</p>

<p>The Angel, shivering, sat down on the tree trunk and stared at
the Doctor.</p>

<p>Crump was getting out his pouch. "You are a strange man," said
the Angel. "Your beliefs are like&mdash;a steel trap."</p>

<p>"They are," said Crump&mdash;flattered.</p>

<p>"But I tell you&mdash;I assure you the thing is so&mdash;I know
nothing, or at least remember nothing of anything I knew of this
world before I found myself in the darkness of night on the
moorland above Sidderford."</p>

<p>"Where did you learn the language then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Only I tell you&mdash;But I haven't an atom of
the sort of proof that would convince you."</p>

<p>"And you really," said Crump, suddenly coming round upon him and
looking into his eyes; "You really believe you were eternally in a
kind of glorious heaven before then?"</p>

<p>"I do," said the Angel.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said Crump, and lit his pipe. He sat smoking, elbow on
knee, for some time, and the Angel sat and watched him. Then his
face grew less troubled.</p>

<p>"It is just possible," he said to himself rather than to the
Angel, and began another piece of silence.</p>

<p>"You see;" he said, when that was finished. "There is such a
thing as double personality...A man sometimes forgets who he is and
thinks he is someone else. Leaves home, friends, and everything,
and leads a double life. There was a case in Nature only a month or
so ago. The man was sometimes English and right-handed, and
sometimes Welsh and left-handed. When he was English he knew no
Welsh, when he was Welsh he knew no English...H'm."</p>

<p>He turned suddenly on the Angel and said "Home!" He fancied he
might revive in the Angel some latent memory of his lost youth. He
went on "Dadda, Pappa, Daddy, Mammy, Pappy, Father, Dad, Governor,
Old Boy, Mother, dear Mother, Ma, Mumsy...No good? What are you
laughing at?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the Angel. "You surprised me a
little,&mdash;that is all. A week ago I should have been puzzled by
that vocabulary."</p>

<p>For a minute Crump rebuked the Angel silently out of the corner
of his eye.</p>

<p>"You have such an ingenuous face. You almost force me to believe
you. You are certainly not an ordinary lunatic. Your
mind&mdash;except for your isolation from the past&mdash;seems
balanced enough. I wish Nordau or Lombroso or some of these
Saltpetriere men could have a look at you. Down here one gets no
practice worth speaking about in mental cases. There's one
idiot&mdash;and he's just a damned idiot of an idiot&mdash;; all
the rest are thoroughly sane people."</p>

<p>"Possibly that accounts for their behaviour," said the Angel
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"But to consider your general position here," said Crump,
ignoring his comment, "I really regard you as a bad influence here.
These fancies are contagious. It is not simply the Vicar. There is
a man named Shine has caught the fad, and he has been in the drink
for a week, off and on, and offering to fight anyone who says you
are not an Angel. Then a man over at Sidderford is, I hear,
affected with a kind of religious mania on the same tack. These
things spread. There ought to be a quarantine in mischievous ideas.
And I have heard another story..."</p>

<p>"But what can I do?" said the Angel. "Suppose I am (quite
unintentionally) doing mischief..."</p>

<p>"You can leave the village," said Crump.</p>

<p>"Then I shall only go into another village."</p>

<p>"That's not my affair," said Crump. "Go where you like. Only go.
Leave these three people, the Vicar, Shine, the little
servant-girl, whose heads are all spinning with galaxies of
Angels..."</p>

<p>"But," said the Angel, "Face your world! I tell you I can't. And
leave Delia! I don't understand...I do not know how to set about
getting Work and Food and Shelter. And I am growing afraid of human
beings..."</p>

<p>"Fancies, fancies," said Crump, watching him, "mania."</p>

<p>"It's no good my persisting in worrying you," he said suddenly,
"but certainly the situation is impossible as it stands." He stood
up with a jerk.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr.&mdash;Angel," he said, "the long and the
short of it is&mdash;I say it as the medical adviser of this
parish&mdash;you are an unhealthy influence. We can't have you. You
must go."</p>

<p>He turned, and went striding through the grass towards the
roadway, leaving the Angel sitting disconsolately on the tree
trunk. "An unhealthy influence," said the Angel slowly, staring
blankly in front of him, and trying to realise what it meant.</p>

<p class="first">SIR JOHN GOTCH was a little man with scrubby hair,
a small, thin nose sticking out of a face cracked with wrinkles,
tight brown gaiters, and a riding whip. "I've come, you see," he
said, as Mrs. Hinijer closed the door.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the Vicar, "I'm obliged to you. I'm really
obliged to you."</p>

<p>"Glad to be of any service to you," said Sir John Gotch.
(Angular attitude.)</p>

<p>"This business," said the Vicar, "this unfortunate business of
the barbed wire&mdash;is really, you know, a most unfortunate
business."</p>

<p>Sir John Gotch became decidedly more angular in his attitude.
"It is," he said.</p>

<p>"This Mr. Angel being my guest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No reason why he should cut my wire," said Sir John Gotch,
briefly.</p>

<p>"None whatever."</p>

<p>"May I ask who this Mr. Angel is?" asked Sir John Gotch with the
abruptness of long premeditation.</p>

<p>The Vicar's fingers jumped to his chin. What was the good of
talking to a man like Sir John Gotch about Angels?</p>

<p>"To tell you the exact truth," said the Vicar, "there is a
little secret&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lady Hammergallow told me as much."</p>

<p>The Vicar's face suddenly became bright red.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Sir John, with scarcely a pause, "he's been
going about this village preaching Socialism?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" said the Vicar, "No!"</p>

<p>"He has. He has been buttonholing every yokel he came across,
and asking them why they had to work, while we&mdash;I and you, you
know&mdash;did nothing. He has been saying we ought to educate
every man up to your level and mine&mdash;out of the rates, I
suppose, as usual. He has been suggesting that we&mdash;I and you,
you know&mdash;keep these people down&mdash;pith 'em."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said the Vicar, "I had no idea."</p>

<p>"He has done this wire-cutting as a demonstration, I tell you,
as a Socialistic demonstration. If we don't come down on him pretty
sharply, I tell you, we shall have the palings down in Flinders
Lane next, and the next thing will be ricks afire, and every damned
(I beg your pardon, Vicar. I know I'm too fond of that word), every
blessed pheasant's egg in the parish smashed. I know
these&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A Socialist," said the Vicar, quite put out, "I had no
idea."</p>

<p>"You see why I am inclined to push matters against our gentleman
though he is your guest. It seems to me he has been taking
advantage of your paternal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, not paternal!" said the Vicar. "Really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"(I beg your pardon, Vicar it was a slip.) Of your kindness, to
go mischief-making everywhere, setting class against class, and the
poor man against his bread and butter."</p>

<p>The Vicar's fingers were at his chin again.</p>

<p>"So there's one of two things," said Sir John Gotch. "Either
that Guest of yours leaves the parish, or&mdash;I take proceedings.
That's final."</p>

<p>The Vicar's mouth was all askew.</p>

<p>"That's the position," said Sir John, jumping to his feet, "if
it were not for you, I should take proceedings at once. As it
is&mdash;am I to take proceedings or no?"</p>

<p>"You see," said the Vicar in horrible perplexity.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Arrangements have to be made."</p>

<p>"He's a mischief-making idler...I know the breed. But I'll give
you a week."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the Vicar. "I understand your position. I
perceive the situation is getting intolerable..."</p>

<p>"Sorry to give you this bother, of course," said Sir John.</p>

<p>"A week," said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"A week," said Sir John, leaving.</p>

<p>The Vicar remained sitting before his desk in his study. "A
week!" he said after an immense silence. "Here is an Angel, a
glorious Angel, who has quickened my soul to beauty and delight,
who has opened my eyes to Wonderland, and something more than
Wonderland,...and I have promised to get rid of him in a week! What
are we men made of?...How can I tell him?"</p>

<p>He began to walk up and down the room, then he went into the
dining-room, and stood staring blankly out at the cornfield. The
table was already laid for lunch. Presently he turned, still
dreaming, and almost mechanically helped himself to a glass of
sherry.</p>

<h2><a id="chap23"></a>THE SEA CLIFF</h2>

<h3>&sect; XLIII</h3>

<p class="first">THE Angel lay upon the summit of the cliff above
Bandram Bay, and stared out at the glittering sea. Sheer from under
his elbows fell the cliff, five hundred and seven feet of it down
to the datum line, and the sea-birds eddied and soared below him.
The upper part of the cliff was a greenish chalky rock, the lower
two-thirds a warm red, marbled with gypsum bands, and from
half-a-dozen places spurted jets of water, to fall in long cascades
down its face. The swell frothed white on the flinty beach, and the
water beyond where the shadows of an outstanding rock lay, was
green and purple in a thousand tints and marked with streaks and
flakes of foam. The air was full of sunlight and the tinkling of
the little waterfalls and the slow soughing of the seas below. Now
and then a butterfly flickered over the face of the cliff, and a
multitude of sea-birds perched and flew hither and thither.</p>

<p>The Angel lay with his crippled, shrivelled wings humped upon
his back, watching the gulls and jackdaws and rooks, circling in
the sunlight, soaring, eddying, sweeping down to the water or
upward into the dazzling blue of the sky. Long the Angel lay there
and watched them going to and fro on outspread wings. He watched,
and as he watched them he remembered with infinite longing the
rivers of starlight and the sweetness of the land from which he
came. And a gull came gliding overhead, swiftly and easily, with
its broad wings spreading white and fair against the blue. And
suddenly a shadow came into the Angel's eyes, the sunlight left
them, he thought of his own crippled pinions, and put his face upon
his arm and wept.</p>

<p>A woman who was walking along the footpath across the Cliff
Field saw only a twisted hunch-back dressed in the Vicar of
Siddermorton's cast-off clothes, sprawling foolishly at the edge of
the cliff and with his forehead on his arm. She looked at him and
looked again. "The silly creature has gone to sleep," she said, and
though she had a heavy basket to carry, came towards him with an
idea of waking him up. But as she drew near she saw his shoulders
heave and heard the sound of his sobbing.</p>

<p>She stood still a minute, and her features twitched into a kind
of grin. Then treading softly she turned and went back towards the
pathway. "'Tis so hard to think of anything to say," she said.
"Poor afflicted soul!"</p>

<p>Presently the Angel ceased sobbing, and stared with a
tear-stained face at the beach below him.</p>

<p>"This world," he said, "wraps me round and swallows me up. My
wings grow shrivelled and useless. Soon I shall be nothing more
than a crippled man, and I shall age, and bow myself to pain, and
die...I am miserable. And I am alone."</p>

<p>Then he rested his chin on his hands upon the edge of the cliff,
and began to think of Delia's face with the light in her eyes. The
Angel felt a curious desire to go to her and tell her of his
withered wings. To place his arms about her and weep for the land
he had lost. "Delia!" he said to himself very softly. And presently
a cloud drove in front of the sun.</p>

<h2><a id="chap24"></a>MRS. HINIJER ACTS</h2>

<h3>&sect; XLIV</h3>

<p class="first">MRS. HINIJER surprised the Vicar by tapping at his
study door after tea. "Begging your pardon, Sir," said Mrs.
Hinijer. "But might I make so bold as to speak to you for a
moment?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mrs. Hinijer," said the Vicar, little dreaming of
the blow that was coming. He held a letter in his hand, a very
strange and disagreeable letter from his bishop, a letter that
irritated and distressed him, criticising in the strongest language
the guests he chose to entertain in his own house. Only a popular
bishop living in a democratic age, a bishop who was still half a
pedagogue, could have written such a letter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hinijer coughed behind her hand and struggled with some
respiratory disorganisation. The Vicar felt apprehensive. Usually
in their interviews he was the most disconcerted. Invariably so
when the interview ended.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>"May I make so bold, sir, as to arst when Mr. Angel is a-going?"
(Cough.)</p>

<p>The Vicar started. "To ask when Mr. Angel is going?" he repeated
slowly to gain time. "Another!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir. But I've been used to waitin' on gentlefolks,
sir; and you'd hardly imagine how it feels quite to wait on such as
'im."</p>

<p>"Such as...'im! Do I understand you, Mrs. Hinijer, that you
don't like Mr. Angel?"</p>

<p>"You see, sir, before I came to you, sir, I was at Lord
Dundoller's seventeen years, and you, sir&mdash;if you will excuse
me&mdash;are a perfect gentleman yourself, sir&mdash;though in the
Church. And then..."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" said the Vicar. "And don't you regard Mr. Angel as
a gentleman?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to 'ave to say it, sir."</p>

<p>"But what...? Dear me! Surely!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to 'ave to say it, sir. But when a party goes turning
vegetarian suddenly and putting out all the cooking, and hasn't no
proper luggage of his own, and borry's shirts and socks from his
'ost, and don't know no better than to try his knife at peas (as I
seed my very self), and goes talking in odd corners to the
housemaids, and folds up his napkin after meals, and eats with his
fingers at minced veal, and plays the fiddle in the middle of the
night keeping everybody awake, and stares and grins at his elders
a-getting upstairs, and generally misconducts himself with things
that I can scarcely tell you all, one can't help thinking, sir.
Thought is free, sir, and one can't help coming to one's own
conclusions. Besides which, there is talk all over the village
about him&mdash;what with one thing and another. I know a gentleman
when I sees a gentleman, and I know a gentleman when I don't see a
gentleman, and me, and Susan, and George, we've talked it over,
being the upper servants, so to speak, and experienced, and leaving
out that girl Delia, who I only hope won't come to any harm through
him, and depend upon it, sir, that Mr. Angel ain't what you think
he is, sir, and the sooner he leaves this house the better."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hinijer ceased abruptly and stood panting but stern, and
with her eyes grimly fixed on the Vicar's face.</p>

<p>"Really, Mrs. Hinijer!" said the Vicar, and then, "Oh Lord!"</p>

<p>"What have I done?" said the Vicar, suddenly starting up and
appealing to the inexorable fates. "What HAVE I done?"</p>

<p>"There's no knowing," said Mrs. Hinijer. "Though a deal of talk
in the village."</p>

<p>"Bother!" said the Vicar, going and staring out of the window.
Then he turned. "Look here, Mrs. Hinijer! Mr. Angel will be leaving
this house in the course of a week. Is that enough?"</p>

<p>"Quite," said Mrs. Hinijer. "And I feel sure, sir..."</p>

<p>The Vicar's eyes fell with unwonted eloquence upon the door.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap25"></a>THE ANGEL IN TROUBLE</h2>

<h3>&sect; XLV</h3>

<p class="first">"THE fact is," said the Vicar, "this is no world
for Angels."</p>

<p>The blinds had not been drawn, and the twilight outer world
under an overcast sky seemed unspeakably grey and cold. The Angel
sat at table in dejected silence. His inevitable departure had been
proclaimed. Since his presence hurt people and made the Vicar
wretched he acquiesced in the justice of the decision, but what
would happen to him after his plunge he could not imagine.
Something very disagreeable certainly.</p>

<p>"There is the violin," said the Vicar. "Only after our
experience&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I must get you clothes&mdash;a general outfit&mdash;Dear me!
you don't understand railway travelling! And coinage! Taking
lodgings! Eating-houses!&mdash;I must come up at least and see you
settled. Get work for you. But an Angel in London! Working for his
living! That grey cold wilderness of people! What will become of
you? If I had one friend in the world I could trust to believe
me!"</p>

<p>"I ought not to be sending you away&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not trouble overmuch for me, my friend," said the Angel. "At
least this life of yours ends. And there are things in it. There is
something in this life of yours&mdash;Your care for me! I thought
there was nothing beautiful at all in life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I have betrayed you!" said the Vicar, with a sudden wave of
remorse. "Why did I not face them all&mdash;say, 'This is the best
of life'? What do these everyday things matter?"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly. "What do they matter?" he said.</p>

<p>"I have only come into your life to trouble it," said the
Angel.</p>

<p>"Don't say that," said the Vicar. "You have come into my life to
awaken me. I have been dreaming&mdash;dreaming. Dreaming this was
necessary and that. Dreaming that this narrow prison was the world.
And the dream still hangs about me and troubles me. That is all.
Even your departure&mdash;. Am I not dreaming that you must
go?"</p>

<p>When he was in bed that night the mystical aspect of the case
came still more forcibly before the Vicar. He lay awake and had the
most horrible visions of his sweet and delicate visitor drifting
through this unsympathetic world and happening upon the cruellest
misadventures. His guest was an Angel assuredly. He tried to go
over the whole story of the past eight days again. He thought of
the hot afternoon, the shot fired out of sheer surprise, the
fluttering iridescent wings, the beautiful saffron-robed figure
upon the ground. How wonderful that had seemed to him! Then his
mind turned to the things he had heard of the other world, to the
dreams the violin had conjured up, to the vague, fluctuating,
wonderful cities of the Angelic Land. He tried to recall the forms
of the buildings, the shapes of the fruits upon the trees, the
aspect of the winged shapes that traversed its ways. They grew from
a memory into a present reality, grew every moment just a little
more vivid and his troubles a little less immediate; and so, softly
and quietly, the Vicar slipped out of his troubles and perplexities
into the Land of Dreams.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XLVI</h3>

<p class="first">Delia sat with her window open, hoping to hear the
Angel play. But that night there was to be no playing. The sky was
overcast, yet not so thickly but that the moon was visible. High up
a broken cloud-lace drove across the sky, and now the moon was a
hazy patch of light, and now it was darkened, and now rode clear
and bright and sharply outlined against the blue gulf of night. And
presently she heard the door into the garden opening, and a figure
came out under the drifting pallor of the moonlight.</p>

<p>It was the Angel. But he wore once more the saffron robe in the
place of his formless overcoat. In the uncertain light this garment
had only a colourless shimmer, and his wings behind him seemed a
leaden grey. He began taking short runs, flapping his wings and
leaping, going to and fro amidst the drifting patches of light and
the shadows of the trees. Delia watched him in amazement. He gave a
despondent cry, leaping higher. His shrivelled wings flashed and
fell. A thicker patch in the cloud-film made everything obscure. He
seemed to spring five or six feet from the ground and fall
clumsily. She saw him in the dimness crouching on the ground and
then she heard him sobbing.</p>

<p>"He's hurt!" said Delia, pressing her lips together hard and
staring. "I ought to help him."</p>

<p>She hesitated, then stood up and flitted swiftly towards the
door, went slipping quietly downstairs and out into the moonlight.
The Angel still lay upon the lawn, and sobbed for utter
wretchedness.</p>

<p>"Oh! what is the matter?" said Delia, stooping over him and
touching his head timidly.</p>

<p>The Angel ceased sobbing, sat up abruptly, and stared at her. He
saw her face, moonlit, and soft with pity. "What is the matter?"
she whispered. "Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>The Angel stared about him, and his eyes came to rest on her
face. "Delia!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" said Delia.</p>

<p>"My wings," said the Angel. "I cannot use my wings."</p>

<p>Delia did not understand, but she realised that it was something
very dreadful. "It is dark, it is cold," said the Angel; "I cannot
use my wings."</p>

<p>It hurt her unaccountably to see the tears on his face. She did
not know what to do.</p>

<p>"Pity me, Delia," said the Angel, suddenly extending his arms
towards her; "pity me."</p>

<p>Impulsively she knelt down and took his face between her hands.
"I do not know," she said; "but I am sorry. I am sorry for you,
with all my heart."</p>

<p>The Angel said not a word. He was looking at her little face in
the bright moonlight, with an expression of uncomprehending wonder
in his eyes. "This strange world!" he said.</p>

<p>She suddenly withdrew her hands. A cloud drove over the moon.
"What can I do to help you?" she whispered. "I would do anything to
help you."</p>

<p>He still held her at arm's length, perplexity replacing misery
in his face. "This strange world!" he repeated.</p>

<p>Both whispered, she kneeling, he sitting, in the fluctuating
moonlight and darkness of the lawn.</p>

<p>"Delia!" said Mrs. Hinijer, suddenly projecting from her window;
"Delia, is that you?"</p>

<p>They both looked up at her window in consternation.</p>

<p>"Come in at once, Delia," said Mrs. Hinijer. "If that Mr. Angel
was a gentleman (which he isn't), he'd feel ashamed of hisself. And
you an orphan too!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap26"></a>THE LAST DAY OF THE VISIT</h2>

<h3>&sect; XLVII</h3>

<p class="first">ON the morning of the next day the Angel, after he
had breakfasted, went out towards the moor, and Mrs. Hinijer had an
interview with the Vicar. What happened need not concern us now.
The Vicar was visibly disconcerted. "He must go," he said;
"certainly he must go," and straightway he forgot the particular
accusation in the general trouble. He spent the morning in hazy
meditation, interspersed by a spasmodic study of Skiff and
Waterlow's price list, and the catalogue of the Medical,
Scholastic, and Clerical Stores. A schedule grew slowly on a sheet
of paper that lay on the desk before him. He cut out a
self-measurement form from the tailoring department of the Stores
and pinned it to the study curtains. This was the kind of document
he was making:</p>

<p><i>"1 Black Melton Frock Coat, patts? &pound;3, 10s.</i>
</p>

<p><i>"? Trousers. 2 pairs or one. 224</i></p>

<p><i>"1 Cheviot Tweed Suit (write for patterns. Self-meas.?)"</i></p>

<p>The Vicar spent some time studying a pleasing army of model
gentlemen. They were all very nice-looking, but he found it hard to
imagine the Angel so transfigured. For, although six days had
passed, the Angel remained without any suit of his own. The Vicar
had vacillated between a project of driving the Angel into
Portburdock and getting him measured for a suit, and his absolute
horror of the insinuating manners of the tailor he employed. He
knew that tailor would demand an exhaustive explanation. Besides
which, one never knew when the Angel might leave. So the six days
had passed, and the Angel had grown steadily in the wisdom of this
world and shrouded his brightness still in the ample retirement of
the Vicar's newest clothes.</p>

<p><i>"1 Soft Felt Hat, No. G. 7 (say), 8s 6d.</i></p>

<p><i>"1 Silk Hat, 14s 6d. Hatbox?"</i></p>

<p>("I suppose he ought to have a silk hat," said the Vicar; "it's
the correct thing up there. Shape No. 3 seems best suited to his
style. But it's dreadful to think of him all alone in that great
city. Everyone will misunderstand him, and he will misunderstand
everybody. However, I suppose it must be. Where was I?")</p>

<p><i>"1 Toothbrush. 1 Brush and Comb. Razor?</i></p>

<p><i>"&frac12; doz. Shirts (? measure his neck), 6s ea.</i></p>

<p><i>"Socks? Pants?</i></p>

<p><i>"2 suits Pyjamas. Price? Say 15s.</i></p>

<p><i>"1 doz. Collars ('The Life Guardsman'), 8s.</i></p>

<p><i>"Braces. Oxon Patent Versatile, 1s 11&frac12;d."</i> ("But
how will he get them on?" said the Vicar.)</p>

<p><i>"1 Rubber Stamp, T. Angel, and Marking Ink in box complete,
9d.</i> "Those washerwomen are certain to steal all his
things."</p>

<p><i>"1 Single-blade Penknife with Corkscrew, say 1s 6d.</i></p>

<p><i>"N.B.&mdash;Don't forget Cuff Links, Collar Stud,
&amp;c."</i> (The Vicar loved "&amp;c.", it gave things such a
precise and business-like air.)</p>

<p><i>"1 Leather Portmanteau (had better see these)."</i>
</p>

<p>And so forth&mdash;meanderingly. It kept the Vicar busy until
lunch time, though his heart ached.</p>

<p>The Angel did not return to lunch. This was not so very
remarkable&mdash;once before he had missed the midday meal. Yet,
considering how short was the time they would have together now, he
might perhaps have come back. Doubtless he has excellent reasons,
though, for his absence. The Vicar made an indifferent lunch. In
the afternoon he rested in his usual manner, and did a little more
to the list of requirements. He did not begin to feel nervous about
the Angel till tea-time. He waited, perhaps, half an hour before he
took tea. "Odd," said the Vicar, feeling still more lonely as he
drank his tea.</p>

<p>As the time for dinner crept on and no Angel appeared the
Vicar's imagination began to trouble him. "He will come in to
dinner, surely," said the Vicar, caressing his chin, and beginning
to fret about the house upon inconsiderable errands, as his habit
was when anything occurred to break his routine. The sun set, a
gorgeous spectacle, amidst tumbled masses of purple cloud. The gold
and red faded into twilight; the evening star gathered her robe of
light together from out the brightness of the sky in the West.
Breaking the silence of evening that crept over the outer world, a
corncrake began his whirring chant. The Vicar's face grew troubled;
twice he went and stared at the darkening hillside, and then
fretted back to the house again. Mrs. Hinijer served dinner. "Your
dinner's ready," she announced for the second time, with a
reproachful intonation. "Yes, yes," said the Vicar, fussing off
upstairs.</p>

<p>He came down and went into his study and lit his reading lamp, a
patent affair with an incandescent wick, dropping the match into
his waste-paper basket without stopping to see if it was
extinguished. Then he fretted into the dining-room and began a
desultory attack on the cooling dinner...</p>

<p>(Dear Reader, the time is almost ripe to say farewell to this
little Vicar of ours.)</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XLVIII</h3>

<p class="first">Sir John Gotch (still smarting over the business
of the barbed wire) was riding along one of the grassy ways through
the preserves by the Bidder, when he saw, strolling slowly through
the trees beyond the undergrowth, the one particular human being he
did not want to see.</p>

<p>"I'm damned," said Sir John Gotch, with immense emphasis; "if
this isn't altogether too much."</p>

<p>He raised himself in the stirrups. "Hi!" he shouted. "You
there!"</p>

<p>The Angel turned smiling.</p>

<p>"Get out of this wood!" said Sir John Gotch.</p>

<p>"Why?" said the Angel.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;," said Sir John Gotch, meditating some cataclysmal
expletive. But he could think of nothing more than "damned."</p>

<p>"Get out of this wood," he said.</p>

<p>The Angel's smile vanished. "Why should I get out of this wood?"
he said, and stood still.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a full half minute perhaps, and then Sir John
Gotch dropped out of his saddle and stood by the horse.</p>

<p>(Now you must remember&mdash;lest the Angelic Hosts be
discredited hereby&mdash;that this Angel had been breathing the
poisonous air of this Struggle for Existence of ours for more than
a week. It was not only his wings and the brightness of his face
that suffered. He had eaten and slept and learnt the lesson of
pain&mdash;had travelled so far on the road to humanity. All the
length of his Visit he had been meeting more and more of the
harshness and conflict of this world, and losing touch with the
glorious altitudes of his own.)</p>

<p>"You won't go, eigh!" said Gotch, and began to lead his horse
through the bushes towards the Angel. The Angel stood, all his
muscles tight and his nerves quivering, watching his antagonist
approach.</p>

<p>"Get out of this wood," said Gotch, stopping three yards away,
his face white with rage, his bridle in one hand and his riding
whip in the other.</p>

<p>Strange floods of emotion were running through the Angel. "Who
are you," he said, in a low quivering voice; "who am I&mdash;that
you should order me out of this place? What has the World done that
men like you..."</p>

<p>"You're the fool who cut my barbed wire," said Gotch,
threatening, "if you want to know!"</p>

<p>"Your barbed wire," said the Angel. "Was that your barbed wire?
Are you the man who put down that barbed wire? What right have
you..."</p>

<p>"Don't you go talking Socialist rot," said Gotch in short gasps.
"This wood's mine, and I've a right to protect it how I can. I know
your kind of muck. Talking rot and stirring up discontent. And if
you don't get out of it jolly sharp..."</p>

<p>"Well!" said the Angel, a brimming reservoir of unaccountable
energy.</p>

<p>"Get out of this damned wood!" said Gotch, flashing into the
bully out of sheer alarm at the light in the Angel's face.</p>

<p>He made one step towards him, with the whip raised, and then
something happened that neither he nor the Angel properly
understood. The Angel seemed to leap into the air, a pair of grey
wings flashed out at the Squire, he saw a face bearing down upon
him, full of the wild beauty of passionate anger. His riding whip
was torn out of his hand. His horse reared behind him, pulled him
over, gained his bridle and fled.</p>

<p>The whip cut across his face as he fell back, stung across his
face again as he sat on the ground. He saw the Angel, radiant with
anger, in the act to strike again. Gotch flung up his hands,
pitched himself forward to save his eyes, and rolled on the ground
under the pitiless fury of the blows that rained down upon him.</p>

<p>"You brute," cried the Angel, striking wherever he saw flesh to
feel. "You bestial thing of pride and lies! You who have
overshadowed the souls of other men. You shallow fool with your
horses and dogs! To lift your face against any living thing! Learn!
Learn! Learn!"</p>

<p>Gotch began screaming for help. Twice he tried to clamber to his
feet, got to his knees, and went headlong again under the ferocious
anger of the Angel. Presently he made a strange noise in his
throat, and ceased even to writhe under his punishment.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the Angel awakened from his wrath, and found
himself standing, panting and trembling, one foot on a motionless
figure, under the green stillness of the sunlit woods.</p>

<p>He stared about him, then down at his feet where, among the
tangled dead leaves, the hair was matted with blood. The whip
dropped from his hands, the hot colour fled from his face. "Pain!"
he said. "Why does he lie so still?"</p>

<p>He took his foot off Gotch's shoulder, bent down towards the
prostrate figure, stood listening, knelt shook him. "Awake!" said
the Angel. Then still more softly, "Awake!"</p>

<p>He remained listening some minutes or more, stood up sharply,
and looked round him at the silent trees. A feeling of profound
horror descended upon him, wrapped him round about. With an abrupt
gesture he turned. "What has happened to me?" he said, in an
awe-stricken whisper.</p>

<p>He started back from the motionless figure. "Dead!" he said
suddenly, and turning, panic stricken, fled headlong through the
wood.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XLIX</h3>

<p class="first">It was some minutes after the footsteps of the
Angel had died away in the distance that Gotch raised himself on
his hand. "By Jove!" he said. "Crump's right."</p>

<p>"Cut at the head, too!"</p>

<p>He put his hand to his face and felt the two weals running
across it, hot and fat. "I'll think twice before I lift my hand
against a lunatic again," said Sir John Gotch.</p>

<p>"He may be a person of weak intellect, but I'm damned if he
hasn't a pretty strong arm. Phew! He's cut a bit clean off the top
of my ear with that infernal lash.</p>

<p>"That infernal horse will go galloping to the house in the
approved dramatic style. Little Madam'll be scared out of her wits.
And I...I shall have to explain how it all happened. While she
vivisects me with questions.</p>

<p>"I'm a jolly good mind to have spring guns and man-traps put in
this preserve. Confound the Law!"</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; L</h3>

<p class="first">But the Angel, thinking that Gotch was dead, went
wandering off in a passion of remorse and fear through the brakes
and copses along the Sidder. You can scarcely imagine how appalled
he was at this last and overwhelming proof of his encroaching
humanity. All the darkness, passion and pain of life seemed closing
in upon him, inexorably, becoming part of him, chaining him to all
that a week ago he had found strange and pitiful in men.</p>

<p>"Truly, this is no world for an Angel!" said the Angel. "It is a
World of War, a World of Pain, a World of Death. Anger comes upon
one...I, who know not pain and anger, stand here with blood stains
on my hands. I have fallen. To come into this world is to fall. One
must hunger and thirst and be tormented with a thousand desires.
One must fight for foothold, be angry and strike&mdash;"</p>

<p>He lifted up his hands to Heaven, the ultimate bitterness of
helpless remorse in his face, and then flung them down with a
gesture of despair. The prison walls of this narrow passionate life
seemed creeping in upon him, certainly and steadily, to crush him
presently altogether. He felt what all we poor mortals have to feel
sooner or later&mdash;the pitiless force of the Things that Must
Be, not only without us but (where the real trouble lies) within,
all the inevitable tormenting of one's high resolves, those
inevitable seasons when the better self is forgotten. But with us
it is a gentle descent, made by imperceptible degrees over a long
space of years; with him it was the horrible discovery of one short
week. He felt he was being crippled, caked over, blinded, stupefied
in the wrappings of this life, he felt as a man might feel who has
taken some horrible poison, and feels destruction spreading within
him.</p>

<p>He took no account of hunger or fatigue or the flight of time.
On and on he went, avoiding houses and roads, turning away from the
sight and sound of a human being in a wordless desperate argument
with Fate. His thoughts did not flow but stood banked back in
inarticulate remonstrance against his degradation. Chance directed
his footsteps homeward and, at last, after nightfall, he found
himself faint and weary and wretched, stumbling along over the moor
at the back of Siddermorton. He heard the rats run and squeal in
the heather, and once a noiseless big bird came out of the
darkness, passed, and vanished again. And he saw without noticing
it a dull red glow in the sky before him.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; LI</h3>

<p class="first">But when he came over the brow of the moor, a
vivid light sprang up before him and refused to be ignored. He came
on down the hill and speedily saw more distinctly what the glare
was. It came from darting and trembling tongues of fire, golden and
red, that shot from the windows and a hole in the roof of the
Vicarage. A cluster of black heads, all the village in fact, except
the fire-brigade&mdash;who were down at Aylmer's Cottage trying to
find the key of the machine-house&mdash;came out in silhouette
against the blaze. There was a roaring sound, and a humming of
voices, and presently a furious outcry. There was a shouting of
"No! No!"&mdash;"Come back!" and an inarticulate roar.</p>

<p>He began to run towards the burning house. He stumbled and
almost fell, but he ran on. He found black figures running about
him. The flaring fire blew gustily this way and that, and he smelt
the smell of burning.</p>

<p>"She went in," said one voice, "she went in."</p>

<p>"The mad girl!" said another.</p>

<p>"Stand back! Stand back!" cried others.</p>

<p>He found himself thrusting through an excited, swaying crowd,
all staring at the flames, and with the red reflection in their
eyes.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" said a labourer, clutching him.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said the Angel. "What does this mean?"</p>

<p>"There's a girl in the house, and she can't get out!"</p>

<p>"Went in after a fiddle," said another.</p>

<p>"'Tas hopeless," he heard someone else say.</p>

<p>"I was standing near her. I heerd her. Says she: 'I can get his
fiddle.' I heerd her&mdash;Just like that! 'I can get his
fiddle.'"</p>

<p>For a moment the Angel stood staring. Then in a flash he saw it
all, saw this grim little world of battle and cruelty, transfigured
in a splendour that outshone the Angelic Land, suffused suddenly
and insupportably glorious with the wonderful light of Love and
Self-Sacrifice. He gave a strange cry, and before anyone could stop
him, was running towards the burning building. There were cries of
"The Hunchback! The Fowener!"</p>

<p>The Vicar, whose scalded hand was being tied up, turned his
head, and he and Crump saw the Angel, a black outline against the
intense, red glare of the doorway. It was the sensation of the
tenth of a second, yet both men could not have remembered that
transitory attitude more vividly had it been a picture they had
studied for hours together. Then the Angel was hidden by something
massive (no one knew what) that fell, incandescent, across the
doorway.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; LII</h3>

<p class="first">There was a cry of "Delia" and no more. But
suddenly the flames spurted out in a blinding glare that shot
upward to an immense height a blinding brilliance broken by a
thousand flickering gleams like the waving of swords. And a gust of
sparks, flashing in a thousand colours whirled up and vanished.
Just then, and for a moment by some strange accident, a rush of
music like the swell of an organ, wove into the roaring of the
flames.</p>

<p>The whole village standing in black knots heard the sound,
except Gaffer Siddons who is deaf&mdash;strange and beautiful it
was, and then gone again. Lumpy Durgan, the idiot boy from
Sidderford, said it began and ended like the opening and shutting
of a door.</p>

<p>But little Hetty Penzance had a pretty fancy of two figures with
wings, that flashed up and vanished among the flames.</p>

<p>(And after that it was she began to pine for the things she saw
in her dreams, and was abstracted and strange. It grieved her
mother sorely at the time. She grew fragile, as though she was
fading out of the world, and her eyes had a strange, far-away look.
She talked of Angels and rainbow colours and golden wings, and was
for ever singing an unmeaning fragment of an air that nobody knew.
Until Crump took her in hand and cured her with fattening dietary,
syrup of hypophosphites and cod liver oil.)</p>

<h2><a id="chap27"></a>THE EPILOGUE</h2>

<p class="first">
AND there the story of the Wonderful Visit ends. The Epilogue is
in the mouth of Mrs. Mendham. There stand two little white crosses
in the Siddermorton churchyard, near together, where the brambles
come clambering over the stone wall. One is inscribed Thomas Angel
and the other Delia Hardy, and the dates of the deaths are the
same. Really there is nothing beneath them but the ashes of the
Vicar's stuffed ostrich. (You will remember the Vicar had his
ornithological side.) I noticed them when Mrs. Mendham was showing
me the new De la Beche monument. (Mendham has been Vicar since
Hilyer died.) "The granite came from somewhere in Scotland," said
Mrs. Mendham, "and cost ever so much&mdash;I forget how
much&mdash;but a wonderful lot! It's quite the talk of the
village."</p>

<p>"Mother," said Cissie Mendham, "you are stepping on a
grave."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Mrs. Mendham. "How heedless of me! And the
cripple's grave too. But really you've no idea how much this
monument cost them."</p>

<p>"These two people, by the bye," said Mrs. Mendham, "were killed
when the old Vicarage was burnt. It's rather a strange story. He
was a curious person, a hunchbacked fiddler, who came from nobody
knows where, and imposed upon the late Vicar to a frightful extent.
He played in a pretentious way by ear, and we found out afterwards
that he did not know a note of music&mdash;not a note. He was
exposed before quite a lot of people. Among other things, he seems
to have been 'carrying on,' as people say, with one of the
servants, a sly little drab...But Mendham had better tell you all
about it. The man was half-witted and curiously deformed. It's
strange the fancies girls have."</p>

<p>She looked sharply at Cissie, and Cissie blushed to the
eyes.</p>

<p>"She was left in the house and he rushed into the flames in an
attempt to save her. Quite romantic isn't it? He was rather clever
with the fiddle in his uneducated way.</p>

<p>"All the poor Vicar's stuffed skins were burned at the same
time. It was almost all he cared for. He never really got over the
blow. He came to stop with us for there wasn't another house
available in the village. But he never seemed to be happy. He
seemed all shaken. I never saw a man so changed. I tried to stir
him up, but it was no good no good at all. He had the queerest
delusions about the Angels and that kind of thing. It made him odd
company at times. He would say he heard music, and stare quite
stupidly at nothing for hours together. He got quite careless about
his dress... He died within a twelvemonth of the fire."</p>
