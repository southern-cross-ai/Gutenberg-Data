<br>

<p class="first">THE GIRL who stormed the back room of the Purple
Dragon Bar where Wild Bill Clanton sat sipping a whiskey-and-soda,
looked out of place in that dive. She advertised her place in the
social register from her insolently tilted beret to her high French
heels. She was tall and slender, but all her lines were supple and
rounded, with melting curves that would make any man's blood run
faster. Just now her purplish eyes flashed and her pertly-tilted
breasts swelled stormily.</p>

<p>"You," she accused Clanton, "are a thief, a liar, and a
rat!"</p>

<p>"So what?" he returned unimpressed, as he poured another
drink.</p>

<p>"Why, you lowlifed&mdash;!" Her refinement skidded a trifle in
her resentment, and she began sketching his genealogy with language
she never learned in the Junior League. He interrupted her
peremptorily.</p>

<p>"Now you hold on! Some things nobody can call me, not even a
lady! Sit down and cool off before somethin' unpleasant happens to
you!"</p>

<p>She wilted at the threat and drooped into the chair opposite
him.</p>

<p>"This," she said bitterly, "is what I get for associating with a
gorilla like you. Why I do it, I don't know."</p>

<p>"I know," he retorted. "Because you wanted Shareef Ahmed's ivory
dragon and I was the only man who could get it for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, you were!" There was rancor in her tone, and her basilisk
glare made him uneasy. You never could tell about these society
dames! If she yanked a knife out of her garter, he meant to smack
her down.</p>

<p>But she had no knife in her garter, as he could tell when she
crossed her silk-clad legs with the regal indifference of a true
aristocrat. She twitched down her skirt an inch or so, but not
before he had a glimpse of white skin that made the blood boil to
his head. Her indifference to his emotions was maddening.</p>

<p>Probably it had never occurred to Old Man Allison's pampered
daughter Marianne that a man on Clanton's social plane would even
think of making a pass at her, but he had to clench his hands to
keep them off of her.</p>

<p>"What's eatin' you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>For answer she produced something from her handbag and smacked
it down accusingly before him. It was a small, pot-bellied ivory
dragon, exquisitely carved and yellowed with age.</p>

<p>"It's a fake!" she declared.</p>

<p>"It's the one Ram Lal stole from Shareef Ahmed," he
asserted.</p>

<p>"It's a fake," she contended moodily. "Either you've gyped me,
or that babu you hired to do the job has, or Ahmed's fooled us
all."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" he asked. "All you want it for is to show to
your society friends back in the United States and brag about it
bein' a rare antique. They won't know the difference."</p>

<p>"Some of them will," she answered, lighting a cigarette with an
injured air. "The collection of Oriental antiques is a great hobby
in my set. It's been a game to see who could get the rarest relic
by fair means or foul. Betty Elston got hold of a priceless Ming
vase in Canton, and she's gloated over the rest of us until I've
wanted to kick her little&mdash;well, anyway, I heard about the Kao
Tsu dragon in San Francisco, and I came all the way to Singapore to
get it. It dates from the Early Han Dynasty, and it's the only one
of its kind in the world. I knew Ahmed wouldn't sell it, so I hired
you to have it stolen for me."</p>

<p>Clanton picked up the yellowed figure and turned it about.</p>

<p>"I dunno," he mused. "Ram Lal got into Ahmed's house and swiped
this. He's the slickest thief on the Peninsula. But if it's the
wrong one, he might be afraid to risk another try. Ahmed's bad
business."</p>

<p>"But he's been paid, and it isn't the right dragon!" she
snapped. "What kind of a man would he be to take money under false
pretences?"</p>

<p>"Hire a thief and then squawk if he gyps <i>you!</i>" he mocked
her. "But keep your shirt on. I'm a man of my word, anyway. I've
taken your dough, and I aim to deliver the goods. Ram Lal's so
scared of Ahmed he's hidin' in an old warehouse down on the
waterfront. Maybe he just got the wrong dragon by mistake. Or he
may be holdin' out on us for more dough. You leave this thing with
me, and tonight I'll go down there and talk to him. If he's on the
level, maybe he'll try again. If he's tryin' to put somethin' over,
well, we'll see."</p>

<p>"I'm going with you," she decided. "I don't trust either of
you."</p>

<p>"It's no place for a white woman," he warned her.</p>

<p>She tilted a scornful nose.</p>

<p>"I can take care of myself, <i>Mister</i>
Clanton&mdash;otherwise I'd never have dared to have any dealings
with you! I'll pick you up near the mosque on Muscat Street. And I
don't want to have to drag you out from under some table, or away
from some brown-skinned wench, either."</p>

<p>"I'll be there, sober and respectable," he assured her. "But how
about a little drink before you go?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks!" she declined. "I prefer to keep our relationship
on a strictly business basis; and whiskey gives men ideas. I'll see
you at dusk."</p>

<p>And she swung out of the room with a long-legged, hip-swaying
gait that made Clanton moan with despair and grab the whiskey
bottle. She had him buffaloed. If she'd been anybody else, he'd
have made a pass at her, regardless. But there was a limit even to
his audacity, and he didn't dare try any rough stuff on the
daughter of Old Man Allison, millionaire and woolly wolf of finance
that the old devil was.</p>

<p>He turned the ivory dragon about in his hands and frowned.</p>

<p>"Antique collectin', eh? Hokum!"</p>
<br>

<p>Rising, he bellowed to a half-caste waiter, plunked a coin on
the table and barged out of a side door. A few moments later he was
seated in a silk shop kept by one Yakub, an old Jew who had a
finger in many enterprises besides the one advertised by the sign
over his door, and whose ear was always close to the mysterious
pulse of the East. Clanton set the ivory dragon before him and
demanded: "What's that?"</p>

<p>Yakub donned square, steel-rimmed spectacles, and regarded
it.</p>

<p>"That's the Kao Tsu dragon," he said. "But I wouldn't handle it
for you. You must have stolen it from Shareef Ahmed. I love life
too much to handle anything stolen from that devil."</p>

<p>"It's a fake," asserted Clanton.</p>

<p>"If it's a fake, I'm a Gentile." answered old Yakub, lovingly
fondling its smooth surface. "Tchk, tchk! Such a pity! I'd buy it
myself if I weren't afraid of Ahmed. He'll slit your throat for
this, sure."</p>

<p>"You'll swear it's genuine?" Clanton demanded.</p>

<p>"My head on it!" The old man's sincerity was convincing.</p>

<p>"Hmmm!" Clanton's scowl deepened. "I wonder what that hussy's
tryin' to put over?"</p>

<p>Then he asked Yakub a strange question, and received a stranger
answer.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">IF Marianne Allison had known of that
conversation, her poise might have been a trifle less confident
when her big coupé purred up to the curb where Clanton stood, just
as the street lights were coming on. He climbed in beside her and
she turned off down a side-street according to his directions.</p>

<p>"Did you bring any money, in case Ram Lal wants more?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I should say not!" she retorted. "He's been paid enough. He
owes me any future service it takes to get the right dragon."</p>

<p>"You're an arrogant wench," he observed, his eyes glued on a
rounded knee. Through accident or design her dress had worked up
again, baring an inch of white skin above the stocking-top.</p>

<p>"When you get through inspecting my leg," she suggested, "you
might tell me which way to turn at this next intersection."</p>

<p>She smiled cruelly as he reluctantly turned his attention to the
street. Feeling perfectly safe from him, she took a feminine
delight in tantalizing him. She was aware of her effect on him, and
she enjoyed seeing the veins in his forehead swell with frustrated
emotion.</p>

<p>"Pull up here." he directed presently, and they rolled to a halt
in a shabby side-street in the native quarter. "I have to leave the
boat here. They may steal the wheels off of it before we get back,
but it won't navigate the alley we've got to follow. Here, this is
it."</p>

<p>It was dark in the alley. They groped their way along and
presently came out into an open space, lined on one side by rotten,
deserted wharves.</p>

<p>"That's the warehouse." Clanton indicated a building looming
darkly before them. "He's got a camp-cot and some canned grub in
one of the lower rooms, and he aims to hide there till I let him
know what move Ahmed's making about that theft."</p>
<br>

<p>No light showed behind the shutters of the barred windows.
Clanton knocked and softly called: "Ram Lal!" No answer, he tried
the door and found it to be unlocked. He pushed it open and
Marianne pressed close on his heels as he entered. She jumped and
grabbed his arm as they stood in the darkness.</p>

<p>"The door! Somebody pushed it to behind us!"</p>

<p>"Wind must have blown it shut," he grunted. "But where the
hell's Ram Lal?"</p>

<p>"Listen!" She clutched him convulsively. Somewhere in the
darkness sounded a steady <i>drip-drip</i> as if somebody had left
a faucet partly open. But Clanton's hair began to rise, because he
knew there wasn't any faucet in that room. He struck a match in a
hurry and held it up. Marianne clapped a hand over her mouth to
stifle a shriek. Clanton swore. In the wavering light they saw Ram
Lal. The fat, swarthy babu slumped drunkenly in a chair near a
table. His head lolled on his breast and his eyes were glassy. And
from a throat slashed from ear to ear, blood still oozed sluggishly
to fall drop by drop in a widening crimson puddle on the floor.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>"God almighty!" muttered Clanton. "We've got to get out of
here&mdash;<i>ow!</i>"</p>

<p>Something that glinted swished at him out of the shadows.
Marianne had a brief glimpse of an arc of gleaming steel and a dark
contorted face behind it. Then the match went out, clipped from
Clanton's hand by that slashing blade, and the dark filled with
hair-raising sounds. Marianne dropped to the floor and scurried on
all-fours in the direction she hoped the door was. She'd lost touch
with Clanton, but he couldn't be dead, because no corpse could put
up the fight he was putting up.</p>

<p>Lurid Anglo-Saxon oaths mingled with Asiatic yowls, and she
almost pitied his adversaries as she heard what sounded like beeves
being knocked in the head with a maul, but which she knew to be the
impact of his massive fists on human skulls. Howls of pain and rage
filled the room, the table overturned crashingly, and then somebody
stumbled over her in the dark.</p>

<p>It was a Malay. She could tell by the smell, even in the dark.
She heard him floundering on the floor near her, and her blood
froze at the <i>wheep-wheep</i> of a keen blade being whirled at
random. It was close behind her, and the flesh of her hips
contracted as she scuttled away on her all-fours. Her groping hands
found a door and pulled it open, but no light came in, and she felt
steps leading upward. But any avenue of escape from that blind
blade flailing the blackness was welcome.</p>

<p>She shut the door behind her and went up the stair as fast as
she could and eventually emerged into an equally dark space that
felt big and empty and smelled musty. There she crouched,
shivering, while the noise of battle went on below, until it
culminated in an amazing crash that sounded as though somebody had
been knocked bodily through a closed door. Then the sounds died
away and silence reigned. She believed that Clanton had broken away
from his attackers and fled, pursued by them.</p>

<p>She was right. At that moment Clanton was racing down a winding
alley, hearing the pad of swift feet close behind him, and
momentarily expecting a knife thrust in the back. They were too
many for even him to fight with his bare hands, and they were
gaining on him. With a straining burst of effort he reached an
empty, dim-lit side-street ahead of them, and before he vanished
into an entrance on the other side, he cast something on the paving
in the light of the dim street-lamp.</p>

<p>Startled yelps escaped his pursuers, and abandoning the chase,
they pounced on the yellowed ivory dragon Clanton had
discarded.</p>

<p>Back in the loft of the deserted warehouse Marianne crept down
the stairs. For some time she had heard no sound below. Then just
as she reached the stair-door, she checked, her heart in her
throat. Somebody had entered the room beyond. But this man wore the
boots of a white man; she could tell by his footfalls. Then she
heard a smothered, English oath.</p>

<p>Clanton must have eluded his pursuers and returned. She heard a
match struck, and light stole through the crack under the door. She
pushed the door ajar. A brawny figure, wearing a seaman's cap, with
his back to the door, was bending over the corpse slumped in the
chair.</p>

<p>"Clanton!" she exclaimed, stepping into the room&mdash;then
checked in her tracks as a perfect stranger whirled around with an
oath. He was as big as Clanton and much uglier. His bloodshot eyes
glared, his black beard bristled, and he levelled a snub-nosed
revolver at her quivering tummy.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot!" she gasped. "I&mdash;I won't hurt you!"</p>

<p>The stranger's reply was unprintable. Evidently her sudden
appearance had given him a bad shock.</p>

<p>"Who the blinkin' hell are you and what're you doin' here?" he
concluded. "Well, talk before I start sweepin' the floor with you!"
He flourished a fist the size of a breakfast ham under her
shrinking nose.</p>

<p>She shuddered and spoke hastily: "I lost my way and wandered in
here by mistake&mdash;I've got to go now&mdash;glad to have met
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stow it!" bellowed the irate intruder. "You can't pull the wool
over Bull Davies' eyes like that!" The aforesaid eyes narrowed
wickedly in the light of the candle on a wall-shelf. "Oh, I get
it!" he muttered. "Of course! You're after the dragon yourself! You
killed Ram Lal to get it! Well, hand it over and you won't get
hurt&mdash;maybe!"</p>

<p>"I haven't got it," she answered. "And I didn't kill Ram Lal.
Shareef Ahmed's men did that. They were waiting in the dark when I
and my companion came in here. I don't know where they went, or
what happened to the man with me."</p>

<p>"Likely yarn," grumbled Mr. Davies. "Ram Lal knew my boss wanted
the dragon. He sent me word to come here tonight and make him an
offer. He'd stole it from Shareef Ahmed. I just now got here, and
found him dead and the dragon gone. It ain't on him&mdash;it must
be on you!" He pointed a hairy and accusing finger at Marianne.</p>

<p>"I tell you I haven't got it!" she exclaimed, paling. "I want
it, yes! If you'll help me find it. I'll pay you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've already been paid," he growled. "And my boss would cut my
throat if I sold him out. You've got that dragon on you somewheres!
You dames are smart about hidin' things on you! Off with them
clothes!"</p>

<p>"No!" She jumped back, but he grabbed her wrist and twisted it
until she fell to her knees with a yelp of pain.</p>

<p>"Are you goin' to shed 'em yourself, or do I have to tear 'em
off?" he rumbled. "If I have to, it'll be the worse for you, blast
you!"</p>

<p>"Let me up," she begged. "I know when I'm licked. I'll do
it."</p>

<p>And under his piglike eyes she shed garment after garment until
she stood before him clad only in a scanty brassiere and
ridiculously brief pink panties. As she discarded each garment, he
snatched it and ransacked it, snarling his anger at finding his
quest fruitless. Now he glared at her, silent and wrathful, and she
squirmed and made protecting motions with her hands. Red fires that
were not of rage began to glimmer murkily in his blood-shot
eyes.</p>

<p>"Isn't this enough?" she begged. "You could see if I had
anything on me the size of that dragon."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe," he admitted grudgingly, laying a heavy hand on
her naked shoulder and turning her about to inspect her from every
angle.</p>

<p>"Baby, you've got what it takes!" he muttered thickly, clapping
a hot, sweaty hand down on her smooth back. "No, it's easy to see
you ain't got that dragon hid on you." He grinned wickedly as one
hand started to move lower. She shrieked and slapped him
resoundingly, and instantly regretted her indiscretion. He grabbed
her in a bear-like embrace and his ardor wasn't lessened a bit by
the glassy stare of the dead man in the chair.</p>

<p>He was carrying her, squirming and fighting, toward the camp-cot
in the corner when he stiffened.</p>

<p>Outside the door sounded a faint babble of approaching voices.
He blew out the candle and turned through an inner door, clapping a
big paw over Marianne's mouth when she tried to scream, and
hissing: "Shut up, you little fool! Do you want your throat cut?
That's Ahmed's men!"</p>

<p>He seemed to know his way about the warehouse, even in the dark.
He stooped, fumbled at the floor, raised a trap-door, whispered:
"If I hear one peep out of you, I'll come down there and twist your
head off! I'll get you out later&mdash;if you're a good
girl!"&mdash;and dropped her.</p>
<br>

<p>She was too scared to yell, even if she'd had breath for it. She
did not fall far till she hit on her feet on a slimy floor. She
heard the trap-door settle back in place, and then the creak of the
stairs. Evidently Davies was taking refuge in the loft. She thought
she heard an outer door open, and a mumble of voices, but forgot it
the next instant at the sight of small red eyes winking fiercely at
her from the gloom. Rats!</p>

<p>She had all a woman's natural fear of rodents, and she had heard
horrifying tales about the ghoulish wharf-rats. But they made no
move to attack her and she began to explore her prison, shivering
in her near nudity. The stone floor stood in several inches of
water, and she found no opening in the slimy walls. She had been
dumped into a cellar and the only way out was up through that
trap-door above her head.</p>

<p>She squealed as a rat ran across her foot, and jumped back
against the wall, bruising her hip and tearing her panties on a
broken plank.</p>

<p>"This is what I get for associating with people like Bill
Clanton," she told herself bitterly, and then the rats started
fighting in a corner. Their hideous racket snapped her taut nerves.
She screamed. She yelled. She was too panicky to care for Davies'
threat. Having her head twisted off seemed preferable to bring
devoured by rats in that black well. She didn't care who heard her,
just so somebody did, and got her out of that damnable cellar. She
didn't care much what they did to her afterward.</p>

<p>And almost instantly her shrieks were answered by sounds
overhead. The trap was lifted and she blinked in the glare of a
lantern. But it was not Davies' bearded face which was framed in
the opening. It was a dark, saturnine, handsome face&mdash;the face
of Shareef Ahmed!</p>

<p>"Well, our little guest didn't run away, after all!" he
commented satirically. "Help her up, Jum Chin."</p>

<p>A tall, gaunt Chinese reached his long arms down, caught her
lifted wrists and swung her up lightly and easily. The trap-door
fell again and she found herself standing before Ahmed, whose dark
eyes devoured her from head to foot. Four Malays with <i>krises</i>
in their belts together with the Chinaman feasted their hot eyes on
her semi-nudity. They were marked generously from Clanton's fists,
from that fight in the dark room.</p>

<p>"A curious interlude!" smiled Ahmed dangerously. "You enter the
building fully clothed, with that dog Clanton. Apparently you
escape in the mêlée. But less than an hour later we find you
imprisoned in the cellar, half-naked!" His eyes went to the white
hip exposed by the accident. She flinched, but did not reply nor
resent the indignity. She was scared as only a girl can be who
knows herself to be in the power of men absolutely merciless and
cynical in their attitude toward women.</p>

<p>"Where is the Kao Tsu dragon?" Ahmed demanded peremptorily.</p>

<p>"I haven't got it!" Her wits were working like lightning on a
scheme.</p>

<p>Ahmed's eyes were poisonous.</p>

<p>"You must have it! Ram Lal stole two dragons out of my house.
Clanton dropped one in his flight." He displayed it. "But it is not
the right one. You must have it. Ram Lal must have stolen them for
you, otherwise Clanton, who came here with you, would not have had
this one. You have the other, or know where it is. Must you be
<i>persuaded</i> to talk?"</p>

<p>"I had it," she said hurriedly, as the Malays moved toward her,
grinning evilly. "But Bull Davies came while you were chasing
Clanton&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Davies?" It was a snarl from Ahmed. "Has that dog of General
Kai's been here?"</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> here&mdash;hiding upstairs. He took the dragon
from me."</p>

<p>"Search the upper floor," snapped Ahmed, and his men made for
the stair, soft-footed as weasels, with naked blades glimmering in
their hands. Marianne breathed in momentary relief. At least she'd
saved herself from torture for the moment. Ahmed was watching the
stair, and she essayed a sneaking step toward the other door. But
he wheeled and caught her wrist.</p>

<p>"Where are <i>you</i> going?"</p>

<p>Nowhere, apparently." She flinched at his sarcasm. "Please,
you're hurting my wrist. Why, the body's gone!"</p>

<p>"We threw it in the river after we returned from pursuing
Clanton," said Ahmed absently, gazing at her half-exposed breasts.
"I meant to take Ram Lal alive and make him talk. But he attacked
my faithful servant, Jum Chin, who traced him here, and Jum Chin
was forced to kill him. I arrived with the rest of my men just
after he had killed Ram Lal. We had just completed a fruitless
search of the body when we heard you and Clanton approaching. Why
did you come here when you already had the dragon?"</p>

<p>"I came to pay Ram Lal," she lied, afraid to admit the truth,
now that she had already professed to have had possession of the
dragon.</p>

<p>"Forget the dragon for a space," he muttered; his eyes were like
flames licking her sleek body. "My men will capture Davies and get
it for me. Meanwhile&mdash;you and I..."</p>

<p>Realizing his intentions she sprang for the nearest door, but he
was too quick for her. He was slender but his thews were like
steel. She yelped as he reached for her&mdash;squealed despairingly
as she realized how helpless she was. She clenched a small fist and
struck him in the face, and in return got a slap that filled her
eyes with stars and tears. He picked her up, fighting and kicking,
and started toward the other room with her, when upstairs a shot
banged, blows thudded, men yelled and heavy boots stampeded down
the stair.</p>

<p>Ahmed dropped Marianne sprawling on the floor and turned to the
stair door, drawing a pistol. An instant later Bull Davies,
plunging through the stairs, brought up short at the threat of that
black muzzle. In an instant the five Orientals who were tumbling
down the stair after him had fallen on him from behind, borne him
to the floor, and had him bound hand and foot. Swift hands
ransacked his garments, and then Jum Chin looked at Ahmed and shook
his head. Ahmed turned on Marianne, who rose from the floor,
rubbing her hip.</p>

<p>"You slut! You said he had it!" Ahmed grabbed a pink-white
shoulder and squeezed viciously.</p>

<p>"Wait!" she begged, assuming a Venus de'Medici pose as he
started to go even further in his third-degree methods. "He must
have hidden it!"</p>

<p>This was going to be just too bad for Davies, she knew, but it
was his hide or hers. Maybe she'd get a chance to slip away while
they were giving him the works.</p>

<p>At a word from Ahmed. Jum Chin slipped Davies' shirt off. A
Malay applied a lighted match to his hairy breast. A faint smell of
singed hair arose and Davies bellowed like a bull.</p>

<p>"I tell you I ain't got it! She's lyin'! I dunno where it
is!"</p>

<p>"If he's lying, we'll soon know," rasped Ahmed. "We'll try a
test that will unlock the jaws of the stubbornest. If he still
persists, we must conclude that he's telling the truth, and the
girl's lying."</p>

<p>Jum Chin stripped off the prisoner's socks, and Davies broke
into a sweat of fear. Intent on the coming torture, Ahmed relaxed
his grip on Marianne's wrist&mdash;or maybe it was a trick to trap
her into a false move.</p>

<p>As his fingers relaxed, she jerked loose and darted into the
outer room. He was after her in an instant, and just as she reached
the door that opened into the alley, his fingers locked in her
hair. But that door burst suddenly inward.</p>
<br>

<p>A big form loomed in the door and an arm shot out. There was a
crack that sounded as if Ahmed had run his face into a brick wall.
But it was a massive fist he had run into, and the impact stretched
him groaning on the floor. His conqueror swooped on the pistol that
flew from his victim's hand, and Ahmed's henchmen, rushing from the
inner room, checked at the menace of the leveled Luger, their hands
shooting ceilingward.</p>

<p>"Clanton!" panted Marianne. He refused to look at her. With six
desperate men before him, he couldn't risk being demoralized by the
spectacle of loveliness her unclad figure presented.</p>

<p>"Put on some clothes!" he snapped. "And you, Ahmed, get up!"</p>

<p>Ahmed staggered up, a ghastly sight, minus three teeth and with
his nose a gory ruin. Clanton grinned pridefully at the sight of
his handiwork; few men could have done so much damage with only one
clout. He profanely silenced Ahmed's impassioned ravings, and
backed all his prisoners into the inner room, whither Marianne
followed, having salvaged the table cloth which she wrapped rather
sketchily, sarong-fashion, about her.</p>

<p>Briefly she explained the situation to Clanton, and he ordered
the men to lie on their bellies and put their hands behind them,
while she tied their wrists and ankles with their belts and
turbans. He watched her in ecstatic silence while she was thus
employed. The improvised sarong was something more than revealing,
as she moved about, allowing glimpses of sweet contours that sent
the blood to his head.</p>

<p>When she had finished the job, he inspected each man, grunting
his approval of her technique, and searching them for weapons. He
lingered longer over Jum Chin, and when he rose, she was amazed to
see a grey pallor tinging the Chinaman's face. Yet Clanton had done
nothing to hurt him.</p>

<p>Clanton then untied Davies, and growled: "I ought to bust your
snoot for pullin' off Miss Allison's clothes and throwin' her in
that cellar, but I'm lettin' you off, considerin' what Ahmed did to
you. Get out!"</p>

<p>"I'll get even with somebody, I bet!" sniveled Mr. Davies, and
departed hastily, aided in his exit by the toe of the Clanton boot.
When his lamentations had faded in the night, Clanton addressed his
glowering prisoners.</p>

<p>"We're leaving. I'll send back a coolie to untie you. Ahmed, you
better forget what's happened tonight. The dragon's gone. Only Ram
Lal knew what became of it, and he's dead. And if the British find
out you killed him, they'll hang you, sure as hell! You let us
alone, and keep your mouth shut, and we'll keep ours shut."</p>

<p>Fear gleamed in Ahmed's one good eye at the mention of hanging.
He was sullenly silent as Clanton followed the girl into the outer
room and closed the door behind them.</p>

<p>"Do you think he'll drop the matter?" she asked nervously. "I
can't afford to have this story get in the papers."</p>

<p>"No, you can't," he agreed. "Theft, murder, torture, bribin' a
thief like Ram Lal and a pirate like me&mdash;it would ruin any
débutante. Best thing you can do is to get out of Singapore as
quick as you can. Ahmed won't forget this. He'll work under cover
to get us, if he can. I ain't afraid of him, but you better take
the first ship back to the U.S.A."</p>

<p>"But I've <i>got</i> to have that dragon!" She was almost
frantic.</p>

<p>Then her eyes dilated as he took something from his
pocket&mdash;an ivory dragon, not so yellow nor so exquisite as the
other she had seen.</p>

<p>"The Kao Tsu dragon!" She snatched at it, but he withheld
it.</p>

<p>"You wait a minute!" He fumbled with the pot-belly for a moment,
and then a section of it swung open. He drew out a strip of
parchment, which had been rolled in the interior. One end remained
fastened in the belly. The parchment was covered with tiny Chinese
characters.</p>

<p>"Then you knew!" She was considerably agitated.</p>

<p>"I knew you wasn't any art collector, and I found out that the
dragon Ram Lal gave me for you was the genuine Kao Tsu. So I did
some sleuthin' and found out plenty. You wanted this for your old
man, and he sent you after it because you're smarter than anybody
workin' for him.</p>

<p>"That writin' is an agreement signed by the Chinese war-lord
they call General Kai, givin' your old man an option on an
important oil concession. He gave it to your old man a few years
ago, in a moment of generosity, and like a Chinaman, rigged the
agreement up in the belly of this dragon, which is a clever copy of
the original Kao Tsu. Your old man thought all the time it
<i>was</i> the Kao Tsu, and that's what you come after.</p>

<p>"Because a few months ago your old man decided to develop that
concession so's to recoup his stock market losses, but General Kai
had changed his mind. He wanted to give that concession to another
firm. But if he refused, in the teeth of his own signed agreement,
he'd lose face. So he had it stolen from your old man, meanin' to
destroy the agreement and then claim he never made it, but Shareef
Ahmed, who don't overlook many bets, had it stolen from Kai's
agent. He already had the original Kao Tsu.</p>

<p>"Then Ahmed offered it to the highest bidder. Your old man had
lost so much money in the stock market crash he was afraid General
Kai would outbid him, so he sent you to steal it. General Kai also
had his agents after it, Bull Davies bein' one of 'em. Ram Lal
stole both dragons. He gave you the real Kao Tsu, but he kept the
one with the contract in it, and was goin' to sell it to General
Kai's agent. You know the rest."</p>

<p>"But the dragon&mdash;" she exclaimed bewilderedly. "That one, I
mean!"</p>

<p>"Easy!" he grinned. "Jum Chin had it all the time. He killed Ram
Lal and must have found the dragon on him before Ahmed got there.
Ahmed trusts Jum Chin so it didn't occur to him to suspect him. An
Arab's no match for a Chinaman in wits. I found it on Jum Chin when
I searched him. He won't dare tell Ahmed we've got it because
that'd betray his own treachery. I sneaked back when they quit
chasin' me and was waitin' outside for a break. Well, I got
it."</p>

<p>"Give the dragon to me!" she exclaimed. "It's mine! I paid
you!"</p>

<p>"You paid me for the genuine Kao Tsu," he said, his eyes
devouring a sleek thigh the sarong left bare. "You got it. This
comes extra."</p>

<p>"How much?" she demanded sulkily.</p>

<p>"Money ain't everything," he suggested.</p>

<p>Suddenly she smiled meltingly and came up to him, laying a
slender hand on his arm. Her nearness made him dizzy, and she did
not resist as he passed an arm about her waist.</p>

<p>"I understand," she breathed. "You win. Give me the dragon
first, though."</p>

<p>Trustingly he placed it in her hand&mdash;and quick as a cat she
plucked the pistol from his belt and smashed him over the head with
the barrel. The next instant she was streaking for the door. But
she underestimated the strength of his skull. To her dismay he did
not fall. He staggered with a gasping curse, then righted himself
and leaped after her. He caught her as she grasped the knob,
slapped the pistol out of her hand and spun her back into the room,
crushing her wrists in one hand as she tried to claw his eyes
out.</p>

<p>"You little cheat!" he snarled. "You've never kept a bargain
yet! Well, you're goin' to keep this one! You've got what you want,
and I'm goin' to get what I want! And you can't squawk, because you
can't have the world knowin' about this night's work!"</p>

<p>Knowledge that this was true pepped up her struggles, but to her
dismay she found them useless against the strength of her irate
captor. All her kicking and squirming accomplished was to
disarrange the sarong, and he caught his breath at the sight of all
the pink and white curves displayed.</p>

<p>"You don't dare!" she gasped, as he drew her roughly to him.
"You don't dare&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bill Clanton didn't even bother to reply to her ridiculous
assertion...</p>
<br>

<p class="first">IT WAS some time later when he grinned at her
philosophically. He stooped and kissed her pouting mouth.</p>

<p>"Maybe that'll teach you not to associate with people like me,"
he said.</p>

<p>Her reply was unprintable, but the look in her eyes contradicted
her words as she took his arm and together they went out to the
street.</p>
