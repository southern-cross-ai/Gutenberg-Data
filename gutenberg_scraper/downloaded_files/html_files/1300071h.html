<h2>Foreword to the 1977 Edition</h2>

<h3>by Bryan Morgan</h3>

<p>The life of a country cleric at the beginning of the present
century was a not unenviable one. Behind him lay the Darwinian
controversy and the long struggle between the evangelical and
tractarian wings of the Anglican church: invisibly far ahead was
our present age of indifference and agnosticism. England was still
a Christian nation and the pews were filled each Sunday. Not for
nearly a century had a Laodicean peace so reigned in the church.
The stipend and perquisites of priest, parson, minister or whatever
were, furthermore, usually adequate for his needs; and above all he
had <i>leisure</i>. In 1800 he would probably have devoted this to
blood sports; but in 1900 more humane standards prevailed and the
clergy were more likely to engross themselves in studies of early
church music or in chess problems. Yet for those with a certain
talent the <i>cacodaemon scribendi</i> intruded to interrupt their
prayers. To write on any subject&mdash;not for glory or even for
money but because it seemed a natural activity which could be put
aside when professional duties called&mdash;was hence a temptation
to many turn-of-the-century clerics.</p>

<p>The whole subject deserves a monograph: was this widespread
creativity connected, for example with the disappearance of the
two-hour sermon? But certainly few part-time authors could rival in
quantity and variety the <i>corpus</i> produced by Canon Victor
Lorenzo Whitechurch.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>Whitechurch (and the 'Lorenzo' came from his half-Spanish
mother) was born on 12 March 1868, the son of an East Anglian
clergyman and the descendant of men ranging from a painter of
distinction to the Master Gunner of England. He was educated at
Chichester Grammar School and then at the Theological College in
the same city, whence he was ordained deacon at the age of
twenty-three. Various curacies&mdash;mainly in the Thames
Valley&mdash;took this slim, very tall and dark-haired man to 1904,
when he attained his own cure of souls at the attractive village
and typically English church of Blewbury near Didcot and his
richest period began.</p>

<p>Perhaps that cure was not over-demanding: but for a man
approaching forty, newly-promoted, not long married and newly a
father, his output was almost prodigious. Already Whitechurch had
published one full-length detective novel, and in the nineteenth
century he had begun to produce short stories for markets ranging
from <i>The Strand</i> to the newly-founded <i>Railway Magazine</i>
and a humorous series for the <i>Boy's Own Paper</i>; but in the
decade after 1904, his production ran to a book a year as well as
many more short stories. The books, furthermore, covered a spectrum
including crime, clerical lore, the topography of those marvellous
chalk downs, and autobiography.</p>

<p>Was Whitechurch inspired to this diverse creativity, one
wonders, by the high and heady air of this corner of the
south-west&mdash;of Alfred's Wessex where 'seven sunken
Englands/Lie buried one by one' and where neolithic trackways
interlaced with the old Great Western single-track running down to
Winchester? Had that flair for drama which made his liberal high
Anglican sermons, delivered in resonant tones, a widespread
attraction (and which also led him to produce and act in amateur
Shakespeare and become a proficient amateur conjurer) demanded a
new outlet? Or had he suddenly acquired a gift of the Holy Ghost?
Certainly he claimed to write 'without plan or premeditation',
never quite knowing how his tales would turn out.</p>

<p>What is sure is that the short stories for which he is best
remembered were written in this period for <i>Pearson's
Magazine</i> and <i>Harmsworth's</i> and were published in 1912 as
a collection under the title of <i>Thrilling Stories of the
Railway</i>. (The British Museum catalogue, it should be noted
here, drops the adjective, presumably as being an advertising
gimmick rather than part of the title proper; and the present
volume follows this usage except when forced to the 'thrilling' for
facsimile purposes.) For these were the stories&mdash;mainly with a
detective element&mdash;of an enthusiast for a subject which
appeals to many schoolboys but which for the privileged few who are
prepared to poke around yards and talk to signalmen becomes a
lifelong interest.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>The nexus between railways and the clergy (today including at
least two bishops, and extended to include such fringe churchmen as
organists) has been often remarked upon but never fully explained.
Should one, for instance, accept the view of a current professor of
scripture that the organisation of a railway is a microcosm of
God's organisation of the universe, or agree with that vicar and
author of popular children's books who claims that despite their
faults the railways and the church are the best ways of
transporting a man to his final destination? Or should one look to
the late Canon Roger Lloyd's opinion that railway-lore is 'morally
good in the sense that it healthily occupies the mind and so
becomes a subsidiary and indirect cause of that self-forgetfulness
which is at the root of all virtue'?</p>

<p>Certainly, though, the clerical or lay enthusiast of the early
years of the present century was a happy man; for Britain's
railways were then at their peak of glory. 'Brief years, from the
death of Queen Victoria to the outbreak of war', as Mr Hamilton
Ellis has written, 'were proud years. Enormous coal-trains rumbled
and handsome expresses rushed about the country. Maintenance was
high and locomotives were often painted in gorgeous colours.'
<i>Bradshaw</i> ran to nearly 1200 pages (a figure never preceded
or exceeded) and in many a country rectory stood as a work of
reference beside <i>Crockford's</i>. Numerous parsons stumped while
drafting a sermon must have relaxed intellectually by working out
the quickest route between Saxmundham and Blisworth.</p>

<p>But Whitechurch was no mere <i>Bradshaw</i>-browser: he had
become almost a practical railwayman. He knew how to scotch a
point, what was the loading-gauge of the Great Northern and how
long an engine took to re-water as well as how to play model-trains
with an eccentric parishioner. And all this knowledge he
transferred to his pet detective, Thorpe Hazell.</p>

<p>Hazell is admittedly to a degree that cut-out figure, the
detective with a gimmick, whose prototype was the great Holmes and
whose like survive today. But he is made more than two-dimensional
by the number and variety of his skills and oddities (which, it
must be remembered, have to be re-established every time in stories
published singly even if they become repetitive in a collected
volume). He anticipates Wimsey-<i>plus</i>-Bunter in his expertness
with incunabula or camera, and adds the unique oddity of his health
regime. For the most part his creator treats Hazell's Swedish drill
and plasmon biscuits dryly and without overt comment: but in one
exchange it appears that the Canon took a rather cynical view of
what in the Shavian heyday was called a 'sanitary' or 'hygienic'
life-style. Whitechurch is indeed often surprisingly relevant to
the present day. Health cranks are always with us, and one suspects
that Thorpe Hazell would have shown a more enthusiastic response
than Victor Whitechurch to muesli breakfasts, fanatically
anti-smoking doctors and the like.</p>

<p>But Hazell's primary characteristic, of course, is that which he
shared with his creator&mdash;his knowledge and understanding of
most aspects of railway lore (for Whitechurch was not really a
locomotive man) from the apparent dryness of signalling procedure
upwards. He is British fiction's only specialised railway
detective, though he soon had an American rival: indeed, no less an
authority than Ellery Queen has called him the first "speciality
detective" of all. He does not, however, fill this book; for only
about half of its contents, those of fairly pure detection, are
"Thorpe Hazel!" tales. The other half consists of stories where the
accent is on adventure&mdash;and, interestingly, these often have a
German villain since writers have always been more astute than
soldiers and politicians in knowing where future menace lay. A few
of these later tales could easily have been recast as Thorpe Hazell
stories, but Whitechurch presumably wanted to divide intellectual
from physical action. What binds the two classes is a shining,
train-trodden ribbon of steel.</p>

<p>In 1913 Whitechurch left his beloved downlands to become
chaplain to the Bishop of Oxford. He was to spend his life in that
diocese. An honorary canonry of Christ Church followed, and he was
on his way to becoming a minor prelate, hampered in cathedral
duties only by his detestation of all forms of music. He then spent
a comparatively quiet if busy war as a hospital chaplain, and at
its close was promoted to the rural deanery of Aylesbury. Other
honours followed; but still his pen would not be still,
particularly during long morning sessions. And though the accent
was now on full-length novels rather than short stories&mdash;and
though too the Canon seems to have lost a little of his railway
enthusiasm after the companies were forced to the defensive and he
now preferred clerical settings for his mayhem&mdash;the
book-a-year routine was observed as regularly and almost as
ritually as a church festival right up to the author's death at the
age of 65 on 25 May 1933.</p>

<p>In one respect Canon Victor Lorenzo Whitechurch has been
atypical of the cleric whose prime fell about the time of the First
World War: after his marriage to Florence Partridge, an artist who
was to illustrate some of his books, he left instead of the usual
quiverful only one daughter&mdash;Bertha, a distinguished artist in
her own right who later married an eminent librarian and became Mrs
James. But one need not be a Freudian to note how often those with
superabundant creative energy are less philoprogenitive than the
world's dullards. And there are better if harder ways of ensuring
that one's name lives after one than flooding the world with
sons.</p>

<p>For Whitechurch <i>does</i> have his immortality, and it is a
greater one than that of Enoch Soames on his yellowing museum
cards. As proof of this, he is mentioned in half a dozen definitive
histories of detective fiction&mdash;American as well as British,
for Whitechurch is probably even more prized in the US than here as
a pioneer of immaculate plotting and factual accuracy: he was one
of the first writers, for example, to submit his manuscripts to
Scotland Yard for vetting as to police procedure. Of distinguished
individual admirers there can be added to the name of Ellery Queen
those of Dorothy L. Sayers, John Carter and others; and their
enconomia have centred particularly on Whitechurch's railway
stories. Yet for many decades the contemporary editions of
<i>Stories of the Railway</i> have been becoming increasingly rare,
and for the last fifteen years or so have become so much a
bibliophile's rarity that anyone who finds a copy in his attic or
in a country bookseller's shop has found treasure. Carter, for
example, called the book "remarkable and inexplicably neglected",
and over thirty years ago Scribner's catalogue described it as
"rare and important".</p>

<p>In conclusion, Whitechurch&mdash;that amiable and (as one story
set in a strike shows) supremely fair-minded yet slightly exotic
man&mdash;would have been the last to claim that he was a great
writer. But he was a very good one, and perhaps more important
historically than he realised.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>PETER CRANE'S CIGARS</h2>

<p>A slight, delicate-looking man, with pale face and refined
features, light red hair, and dreamy blue eyes.</p>

<p>Such is a brief description of Thorpe Hazell, book-collector and
railway enthusiast, a gentleman of independent means, whose
knowledge of book editions and bindings was only equalled by his
grasp of railway details.</p>

<p>At least two railway companies habitually sought his expert
advice in the bewildering task of altering their time tables, while
from time to time he was consulted in cases where his special
railway knowledge proved of immense service, and his private
notebook of such "cases" would have provided much interesting copy
to publishers.</p>

<p>He had one other peculiarity. He was a strong faddist on food
and "physical culture." He carried vegetarianism to an extreme, and
was continually practising various "exercises" of the strangest
description, much to the bewilderment of those who were not
personally acquainted with his eccentricities.</p>

<p>With this brief introduction of the man, it is proposed to set
forth, for the first time, a selection of railway "cases" in which
he played a more or less prominent part.</p>

<hr>

<p>"I tell you I only paid fivepence each for them."</p>

<p>Harry Brett took the cigar from his customer's hand, looked
critically at it, smelt it, and then shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p>"Can't be done!" he said, "must be a fake."</p>

<p>"Unroll it&mdash;you're welcome."</p>

<p>The young tobacconist broke the cigar in half, rubbed the leaves
between his palms, and examined them carefully.</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es," he admitted, "it's right enough. Same leaf all
through."</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?"</p>

<p>Harry Brett turned round, reached for a box on a shelf, took it
down, and selected a cigar, which he compared with the fragments
lying on his counter.</p>

<p>"Same brand," he said at length. "But I can't make it out at
all. Now, I can't afford to sell these under sixpence each, or
sevenpence from a broken box, and even then the profit's a mere
nothing. You must have got these over the water Mr. Wilson?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't."</p>

<p>"You couldn't have bought 'em retail at the price."</p>

<p>"I did, though."</p>

<p>"What, at a shop?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In this town."</p>

<p>"In Netherton?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"By George! Who was it, Mr. Wilson?"</p>

<p>"Well, at Crane's, if you want to know. There's no secret about
it." Harry Brett brought down his fist on the counter with a bang
that made the scales rattle. The mention of Crane's name had
evidently upset him.</p>

<p>"It's all very well," he said, "but I tell you it can't be done.
Either Crane's a bigger fool than I took him for, or he means
having you in the end, and is only running this sort of thing to
advertise his business. Why, he hardly knows anything about the
trade; he's only been in it six months. You're welcome to buy them,
Mr. Wilson, of course. <i>I</i> can't do them at the price."</p>

<p>"Well," returned the customer, "I'm a bit of a judge of a weed,
and if he begins palming off inferior stuff he won't impose on me.
But till then I'll save my money and deal with him. But, as he
makes no reduction in other goods, I'll take a tin of my usual
mixture from you."</p>

<p>"Oh, go and get your baccy where you buy your cigars," exclaimed
Harry Brett, who had been working himself up into quite a rage. "I
don't hold with all this underselling business, nor with those who
encourage it. Good morning, sir!"</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson smiled slightly at the young man's outburst of
passion, shrugged his shoulders, and walked out of the shop.</p>

<p>Harry Brett leant on the counter with his elbows, gazing angrily
at the fragments of the object which had upset him so much. He had
been a tobacconist from his boyhood upwards, having begun to work
in his father's shop ever since leaving school, and since his
father's death, three years previously, he had come into the
business. It was not a very large one, but it was well established,
and had many old customers. And Harry himself had been calculating
for some little time that there was profit enough out of the shop
to support two, besides which he had a very distinct notion of the
choice of a partner.</p>

<p>But for the last three months certain things had troubled him.
His takings had grown distinctly less, and certain customers had
become irregular. And it was a curious coincidence that these
troubles had begun to date from the time when Peter Crane had
opened a rival business in Netherton, with an announcement that
during the first week he would give away a "tip-top cigar" with
every quarter of a pound of tobacco purchased.</p>

<p>It was galling, inasmuch as this Peter Crane had nothing to
recommend him. Netherton knew him as a ne'er-do-well, turning up
every now and again at his widowed mother's, who kept a small
confectionery shop in the town. He had cleared one window of this
shop of its contents, and substituted the fragrant weed in its
various forms, and, as often as not, his mother dispensed these
goods, for there were intervals during which Peter Crane himself
seemed to abandon his new trade.</p>

<p>"Well, Brett," said a quiet voice, suddenly, "you seem wrapped
in thought. What is puzzling you? Half a minute, please, before you
answer. It is time for my mid-day exercise."</p>

<p>Brett looked up at Thorpe Hazell, who had entered without noise,
and now stood before him twirling his arms rapidly round his head
and then suddenly thrusting them out in front. Hazell lived at
Netherton, but had a little bachelor flat in town, where he spent a
good deal of his time. He was a regular customer of Brett, who knew
his little eccentricity.</p>

<p>When he had finished Brett told him about the cigar and his
suspicions. Hazell leant on the counter and listened
attentively.</p>

<p>"I know this young Crane," he remarked, "and I'm afraid he
doesn't bear the best of characters. Of course, this affects your
trade?"</p>

<p>"It does, sir, to a certain extent."</p>

<p>"Do you suspect anything?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I hardly like to say. This particular brand of cigar
can be picked up very cheaply in Holland or Belgium, and if they
could be got over without the duty I could understand it."</p>

<p>"You think it's a question for the Revenue officials?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>I'm</i> not going to put them on his track," said Brett
scornfully. "There's honour in trade as in other things. Besides
which, if there were nothing in it I should pose as a spiteful sort
of chap, and it would be all the worse for me."</p>

<p>"I see. You've excited my curiosity, Brett. Well, I want some
cigarettes of the usual brand&mdash;thank you. If you hear anything
about Crane's movements you might let me know. And, by the way,
don't talk about the thing. Good morning."</p>

<p>On his way home he called in at Crane's shop. Here he made a
trifling purchase. Mrs. Crane served him.</p>

<p>"H'm," he muttered to himself as he regained the street. "That
collarette of hers was genuine Brussels lace. I wonder whether
Brett's suspicions are correct. It may be a case worth
investigating."</p>

<p>Netherton was about twenty-five miles from London, on the
Mid-Southern and Eastern Railway, and Thorpe Hazell constantly ran
up to town. On this particular evening he was due at a meeting at
Kensington.</p>

<p>He had scarcely taken his seat in the train when a young man
came in and sat opposite. Hazell glanced at him over his paper, and
recognised him as Peter Crane. He remembered Brett's little
difficulty for a moment, but dismissed the subject as he resumed
his paper.</p>

<p>Now, when the train drew up at the London terminus of the
Mid-Southern and Eastern Railway, Hazell did not hurry himself in
the least. He was not due at Kensington just yet, so he determined
to wait till the departure of the Continental train. There were
many things to interest him. The type of engine running, the number
of coaches&mdash;dozens of details that are only apparent to the
enthusiast of railway matters.</p>

<p>He was standing on the platform, taking in these various things,
when he suddenly caught sight of Crane going into the Continental
booking-office. An impulse seized him, and a moment or two later he
was standing close behind the tobacconist, overhearing him ask for
a return ticket to Gantes. He began to be interested.</p>

<p>"Now," he reasoned to himself as he went out of the station and
took a hansom, "there's evidently a bit of clever smuggling going
on here. Let's think. A return ticket. How does he get the cigars
through? <i>How</i> does he bring them back? Seems to me there's a
chance of a railway mystery here. Of course, it may be on the boat,
but I shouldn't think so. I'll have a look into this. There's any
amount of frontier smuggling on Continental railways, I know. I
once saw half a hundredweight of tobacco fixed under a passenger
coach on the St. Gothard, and beautifully run through Chiasso. This
may be well worth investigating."</p>

<p>Once having made up his mind, Hazell lost no time in making
further inquiries as soon as he returned to Netherton, the result
being that he ascertained that Crane had a regular date in the
month for absenting himself from home.</p>

<p>And so it happened that the next time the latter took a return
ticket to Gantes, Thorpe Hazell, disguised in a black wig, and
looking very much like a commercial traveller, was already seated
in the Continental train, booked through to the same destination.
He had his eyes wide open, and had already taken in the fact that
Crane's luggage consisted of a fair-sized brown Gladstone, and a
very large black kit bag.</p>

<p>Hazell kept well out of Crane's way all the journey, for he knew
very well that it was the return trip only that demanded careful
scrutiny. So he snatched what sleep he could. They reached Gantes
in the small hours of the morning, and Hazell noticed that Crane
put the kit bag in the cloak-room, after which he proceeded to an
adjacent hotel, a porter carrying his Gladstone.</p>

<p>Hazell, whose luggage was quite small, looked about him, noticed
a hotel just opposite, rang up the sleepy night-porter, and took a
front room, so that he could command the entrance of Crane's hotel.
Instead of undressing, he opened his bag, changed into a tourist's
knickerbocker suit, and then lay down on his bed with a
determination not to sleep more than a couple of hours.</p>

<p>At daybreak he was at his window, keeping careful watch. An hour
or two passed, and then his patience was rewarded. Crane came out
of the hotel, smoking a cigar and suspecting nothing.</p>

<p>The next minute Hazell was in the street, following his prey to
the station. He lounged into the booking-office in time to hear
Crane take a return ticket to Antburg.</p>

<p>Then he inquired of the booking-clerk casually whether one could
take a return to Antburg and come back the next day.</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, tickets are only available for one day."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders lazily, for he never believed in
taking too much trouble over anything. It was clear that Crane
would be back in Gantes that day. The only thing was to find out
whether he took his black bag with him. He did.</p>

<p>"Now," said Hazell to himself, as he went back to his hotel,
"that young man is precious shrewd. It's pretty clear he's gone
over to Antburg to get his goods&mdash;there isn't a better place
in Northern Europe for getting them&mdash;probable out of bond,
too. But why does betake this route? It's a roundabout way to get
to Antburg. I know. He works the trick on the Mid-Southern and
Eastern, and the other line won't do. It's well worth finding out,
but I can't do anything yet."</p>

<p>He had his breakfast, strolled round the town, and finally came
back to his room. He had jotted down the times of trains returning
from Antburg.</p>

<p>Then he settled himself to perform a "nerve-strengthening"
exercise, which consisted of lying down on the flat of his back and
holding a tumbler of water, filled to the brim, over his head for
ten minutes at a time, the object being not to spill a drop of it.
He entirely abstracted himself from the object in hand, except at
such times as Antburg trains were due, when he got up and carefully
watched the street leading from the station.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Crane appeared once more and entered his hotel.
Then Hazell paid his bill, went to the station, and waited for the
train back to England. He was keen and alert now. If that black
bag, which he surmised was in the cloak-room, contained cigars, he
was particularly anxious to see how the Customs were evaded.</p>

<p>Exactly in accordance with his surmises, Peter Crane came down
to the station in time for the afternoon boat train.</p>

<p>And this is what he did. He took the black bag out of the cloak
room and registered it through to London. That meant that until the
bag reached London he could not possibly get at it, and then he
would have to open it in the presence of the Customs' officials,
through registered luggage being examined there, and not at
Dovehaven. The brown bag, which appeared to be heavy, he took in
the train with him.</p>

<p>Thorpe Hazell began to be mystified. Assuming the bag to be
filled with cigars, he could see no way in which they could be
brought through free of duty. He watched the luggage being taken on
the boat at Ozende, but Crane was absolutely regardless, and had
thrown himself on a saloon berth, and was sleeping almost
immediately, his brown bag beside him.</p>

<p>At Dovehaven the examination of hand luggage took place, and
Hazell had squeezed himself close beside Crane in order that he
might see what was in the brown bag. There was nothing suspicious.
It contained quite a pile of books and articles of clothing, a pink
shirt being rather conspicuous.</p>

<p>As soon as the examination was over Crane turned to the porter
who was carrying the bag.</p>

<p>"Put that in the van," he said. "Label it for London. I shan't
want it in the carriage with me."</p>

<p>Hazell, still wondering, now went up to the guard's van and
watched the luggage being put in, both of Crane's bags being among
them. The guard himself was busily engaged helping the porters, as
the boat was rather late, and he was anxious to get off.</p>

<p>"Now then, sir, are you going on? Take your seat, please. Right
away!"</p>

<p>A shrill whistle, a wave of the green lamp, and the train was
off, the next stop being the London terminus.</p>

<p>"Curious," said Hazell to himself as he took a packet of plasmon
chocolate, and a flask of milk out of his bag and proceeded to
"dine." "Perhaps I'm wrong, after all. Ah!"&mdash;as a thought
struck him&mdash;"well, we'll wait till we get to town."</p>

<p>A couple of hours later that night the train drew up at the
London terminus, having, of course, run through Netherton without a
stop. Behind the long barrier stood a number of Custom House
officials waiting to examine the registered luggage before it was
passed through. Hazell watched by the guard's van until Crane's two
bags were deposited on the platform. Crane took charge of the brown
one himself, and a porter followed him with the black one to the
examination counter. Hazell stood a little behind, eagerly awaiting
the result.</p>

<p>"Anything to declare, sir? Tobacco, scent, cigars?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>"Open your bag, please."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>He unlocked the large black bag and threw it open. Hazell bent
forward. And he caught a glimpse of a pink shirt&mdash;and
books.</p>

<p>The black bag contained the identical articles that he had seen
in the brown bag at Dovehaven.</p>

<p>A solution struck him. Glancing round he saw a platform
inspector whom he knew. Rushing up to him he exclaimed, in a
whisper: "Jarvis&mdash;I'm Mr. Hazell&mdash;look here."</p>

<p>"Lor', sir, I shouldn't have known you. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush. Don't let on, man. Quick; you see that fellow in the
light overcoat doing up his bag. Get one of those officers to
examine the brown bag by his side. Sharp!"</p>

<p>The next moment Jarvis was behind the counter and had spoken a
word to the official. Crane had just strapped up his bag and was
moving off. Hazell had darted away.</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;one moment."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"That other bag. I want to see it."</p>

<p>"It's not registered luggage. It was examined at Dovehaven.
Here's the chalk mark on it."</p>

<p>"Never mind. Open it, please."</p>

<p>"Oh! very well," cried Crane with a laugh, laying it down on the
counter and unstrapping it. "Here you are."</p>

<p>The official looked inside, his face burst into a smile. "All
right, sir!" he exclaimed, "that's soon settled."</p>

<p>Jarvis, who was standing by, smiled too. A minute later Hazell
accosted him.</p>

<p>"Well," he asked, "what was inside that bag?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir. It was <i>empty!</i>"</p>

<p>"Empty was it? Oh! please say nothing about this, Jarvis."</p>

<p>He went into the refreshment-room, ordered a cup of coffee, lit
a cigarette, and sat down to think it over. For once in his life he
was completely baffled. It had seemed quite simple to him as he
came up in the train, and he had thought that the opening of the
brown portmanteau would prove the solution of the enigma. Alter a
while a plan of action developed in his mind, and he went out of
the refreshment-room. Jarvis was still on the platform.</p>

<p>"Jarvis," he said, "I don't want it known that I came up by the
boat train to-night."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

<p>Jarvis knew of more than one railway mystery in which Thorpe
Hazell had been involved, and was to be trusted.</p>

<p>"Thought you'd caught a bit of smuggling, sir?" he asked. "Oh!"
drawled Hazell, "I was a little suspicious, that was all. Capital
run up to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Bob Nobes is a good driver."</p>

<p>"Ah! The guard was smart with the luggage at Dovehaven."</p>

<p>"John Crane, sir? Yes. He's one of our best guards. Runs this
train in regular shifts."</p>

<p>Hazell's eyes sparkled for a moment.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;er&mdash;didn't see what became of that young
man?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Got into the train on No. 2 platform."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's mine, I believe, to Netherton. Goodnight,
Jarvis."</p>

<p>He got into the train, a smile of satisfaction on his face. He
meant to master this little mystery.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>A couple of days later he was buying cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Oh, by-the-way, Brett," he said, "I think I can promise you
that your hated rival will shortly shut up shop."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir! Well, I shouldn't be sorry. I've lost half my
trade in cigars."</p>

<p>"Ah! Oh, I say, Brett, there's a fellow named John
Crane&mdash;something on the line. Know him?"</p>

<p>"Peter's cousin, sir."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, keep your mouth shut, and let me know when Crane
goes away from home. I think we might have quite a little bit of
fun then."</p>

<p>Three or four weeks later Thorpe Hazell received a note from
Brett. In answer to it he wrote:</p>

<p>"Come round to my house to-morrow at about 8 p.m. Bring a great
coat."</p>

<p>The tobacconist duly turned up, and found Hazell in his study.
"Sit down, Brett. Have some toast and water. No? Well, then, take
one of your own cigarettes."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"I ordered the dog-cart for 8.30," went on Hazell. "We have
quite a drive before us. That's why I mentioned your great
coat."</p>

<p>"What are we going to do, sir?"</p>

<p>"You'll see all in good time."</p>

<p>They were soon bowling along the high road in the opposite
direction from that of London. Hazell had the reins, and was not
disposed to be communicative. After they had gone about seven or
eight miles, Hazell turned down a by-road.</p>

<p>"You know where this leads, Brett?"</p>

<p>"Across Pinkney's Common, sir."</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>Presently he said:</p>

<p>"There are the lights of the main line signals?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>A couple of red lights stood out in the blackness of the sky.
"And there's the level crossing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"All right. We'll put our lamps out."</p>

<p>He drew up to perform the operation.</p>

<p>"Good, and now we're going to drive on the grass across the
common. And don't speak above a whisper, please."</p>

<p>They drew nearer the line. On their left, where the road crossed
the railway, the bright light of the gatekeeper's-box was
discernible. Presently Hazell pulled up.</p>

<p>"We'll tie the cob to this tree," he whispered. "That's right.
We shan't have long to wait."</p>

<p>"It's a lonely place," said Brett.</p>

<p>"Quite so. We don't want to go close up to the line. This will
do. It's the up-train we want."</p>

<p>Wondering what was going to happen, Brett waited.</p>

<p>Presently Hazell said: "Here she comes. Those are her
headlights. Now you watch what happens. Keep your eyes open."</p>

<p>A white light above a green appeared in the distance, and grew
brighter every moment. Then there was a roar as the approaching
express bore down upon them. The train was running on a slight
embankment, and they could see along its whole length.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Brett suddenly, "one of the doors is open&mdash;in
the last carriage."</p>

<p>"Exactly. The guard's van, Brett. There he stands. Look out! Ah!
There's a pretty little smuggling dodge for you."</p>

<p>As the train swept by they could distinctly see the guard
silhouetted against the light in his van. He appeared to be leaning
out of his door, holding some large and heavy object. The next
moment he had dropped this on to the soft turf of the embankment.
As the train rushed by the crossing, a green light appeared for a
moment, held out of the guard's van, and turned towards the rear of
the train.</p>

<p>"Now," exclaimed Hazell, "we'll just wait and see what happens.
First of all, we'll get as close as we can to that
package&mdash;ah!&mdash;here it is. A convenient bush to hide us,
too. He's coming, Brett!"</p>

<p>A man, carrying a lantern, came with a limping gait from the box
at the level-crossing. Every now and then he paused, as if looking
for something. Presently he gave a grunt of satisfaction as the
light fell on a package lying on the grass.</p>

<p>He was just about to pick it up when Hazell stepped forward and
said, very quietly:</p>

<p>"How much do you get for your share in this little transaction,
my man?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed the other, dropping his lantern in his
fright. Hazell picked it up and turned it on him.</p>

<p>"Ah, you've a wooden leg, I see. No use to try to run. I suppose
you were to keep this little lot till Crane came for them?"</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;don't be hard on me, sir. I don't know nothin'
about the contents&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;if you split to the
company, sir, I'd lose my post."</p>

<p>Hazell laughed.</p>

<p>"Answer my first question, man. How much do you get out of
this?"</p>

<p>"Ten bob a time," faltered the delinquent.</p>

<p>"Poor pay for the risk! How long has Crane been running
this?"</p>

<p>"Six or seven months, sir."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, I'm afraid he won't find this little lot
to-morrow. You can tell him when he comes for them that we've
forestalled him. I should advise you to get your half-sovereign out
of him before you tell him. And you can also add that if he wants
to get them again he'd better call at Somerset House.
Good-night&mdash;here's your lantern."</p>

<p>"I shall lose my post, sir."</p>

<p>"Not this time. You may think yourself lucky, though. Here,
Brett, give me a hand with this parcel."</p>

<p>They carried the bundle, which was securely corded in thick
American cloth, to the trap, and drove home. An hour or so later
they were sitting in Hazell's study.</p>

<p>"I think we're entitled to one each before I send them to the
Customs," said Hazell, selecting a cigar. "Now, how much do you
think he cleared out of this lot?"</p>

<p>Brett looked at the four dozen boxes.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if he got them, as you say, at Antburg, I can pretty
well guess the price he paid. He ought to have saved quite
twenty-five pounds in duty&mdash;very likely more. Altogether, the
run was worth at least fifty pounds. But how did you find it out,
sir?"</p>

<p>Hazell told him of his journey to Gantes and of the Customs
examination in London.</p>

<p>"I own I was baffled for the moment," he said, "but, of course,
I knew that he wouldn't have taken that journey to bring back an
empty bag. Inquiry confirmed my suspicions that the guard was in
it, possessing a duplicate key to the black bag, and I saw where
the solution was. Undoubtedly the cigars were in the country, the
only question was their whereabouts.</p>

<p>"The problem was very simple. I had only to keep a watch on
Crane. He didn't notice the cyclist who followed him when he took a
trap from here the next day, nor did he see that same cyclist lying
behind a bush on Pinkney's Common with a field-glass watching him
get a parcel from the level-crossing box. The rest you know. I
guessed pretty accurately where the guard dropped them, and here
they are."</p>

<p>"There's one thing I don't understand, sir," replied Brett, "and
that is, why the guard didn't put the cigars in the brown bag and
throw that out&mdash;or, in fact, why he took two bags at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, but that was where his greatest artfulness came
in&mdash;the subtlety of the whole thing. The black bag was weighed
at Gantes, and its weight registered. It was necessary to have a
corresponding weight to it when it arrived in London. That's why he
carried those heavy books and used the other bag for them.</p>

<p>"Then he and the guard knew perfectly well that detectives are
pretty sharp in these matters, and if it had been noticed that he
started back with two bags and only one arrived, especially as he
was doing this more than once, suspicion would have been aroused.
That's why the other bag was not thrown out. The whole thing was
beautifully planned. Now we'll pack up&mdash;stop, though&mdash;I
want three or four more of those cigars. That's right."</p>

<p>He packed up the cigars, and directed them to H.M. Customs.</p>

<p>"There," he said, "we'll send it anonymously. I expect, after
his little visit to Pinkney's Common crossing, Master Crane will
take a holiday. I must really thank you, Brett, for having given me
an interesting little problem. I don't think we need take any
further action. The three of them will have quite fright enough to
stop them. Good night!"</p>

<p>Hazell was right. Peter Crane suddenly disappeared from view,
and the tobacco window was devoted to confectionery again. Harry
Brett's prospects so increased with the return of custom that he
made a formal proposal for the partnership, which was duly
accepted, and the deed signed in the vestry of the parish church.
Some weeks after the incident Thorpe Hazell was on the platform of
the London terminus of the Mid-Southern and Eastern Railway,
watching the incoming of the Continental express. As soon as the
bustle was over, he strolled up to the rear guard, who was standing
by his van.</p>

<p>"Have a cigar, guard!" he said, offering his case.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"Take three or four. They're more yours than mine."</p>

<p>"What, sir?"</p>

<p>"I believe you dropped them out of your van&mdash;some weeks
ago&mdash;just by Pinkney's Common crossing. Good-night!"</p>

<p>He turned his head when he reached the end of the platform.
There was Guard Crane, standing like a statue, gazing at him with a
paler face than was caused by the electric light.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>THE TRAGEDY ON THE LONDON AND
MID-NORTHERN</h2>

<p>Thorpe Hazell opened his paper lazily as he breakfasted on
boiled rice and wholemeal bread in his little West-end flat one
very cold winter's morning in January. His interest in passing
events was not very much excited until in turning a page he found
himself confronted with the headlines:</p>

<p align="center">SHOCKING ACCIDENT ON THE RAILWAY<br>
SAD FATALITY</p>

<p>Folding the paper and shifting his seat so that the electric
light fell better upon it, for it was rather dark, and his
breakfast was an early one, he read as follows:</p>

<p>"A terrible occurrence took place on the London and Mid-Northern
Railway last evening. As the express from London, due at
Manningford at about a quarter past eight, was entering the
station, those on the platform noticed a man leaning out of one of
the windows, apparently in the act of opening the door of his
compartment, and more than one porter shouted a warning to him to
wait until the train stopped.</p>

<p>"When, however, the carriage had come to a standstill, he
remained motionless, and those who were near noticed to their
horror, that the well-known white panels adopted by this company
were stained with an ominous colour, while blood was trickling from
the man's head.</p>

<p>"Assistance was rendered at once, but it was soon seen that the
unfortunate passenger was quite beyond the reach of recovery,
although it was the opinion of a doctor who happened to be on the
platform that life could only have been extinct for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>"The victim of this terrible tragedy was, as has been described,
leaning out of the window, his arms and head hanging over the door,
which had to be unlocked before he could be taken out. There was a
bad wound in the back of his head and neck, as though he had
received a violent blow, and a piece of one of his ears had been
torn off.</p>

<p>"He had been travelling alone in a first-class compartment, and
held the return half of a ticket to Manningford. All Manningford
tickets are collected at Bridgeworth, about ten miles up the line,
the last stopping station before Manningford, and inquiries have
shown that the inspector on duty there had duly taken his ticket,
so that he must have met with his death during the last ten miles
of the journey.</p>

<p>"The guard of the train states that, on his own request, he
locked the compartment at the London terminus just before the train
started, and declares that the unfortunate passenger was quite
alone during the whole of the journey. His identity has not yet
been proved, but, apparently, he is a foreigner. He is tall and
dark, with a military-looking moustache, is about fifty years of
age, and has a slight scar on his right cheek.</p>

<p>"He had no luggage, and the few papers found upon him were, we
hear, written in French, but give no clue to his identification.
These papers are in the hands of the police, and the body has been
removed to one of the company's offices pending the inquest.</p>

<p>"As to the cause of death, the authorities are inclined to the
belief that it was an accident caused by his own carelessness, but
nothing definite is yet known. Between Bridgeworth and Manningford
there are several bridges over the line, and it is conjectured that
his head must have come into collision with the brickwork of one of
these structures while looking out of the window.</p>

<p>"It will be remembered that a similar fatality took place near
Liverpool some years ago, resulting in the death of a prominent
citizen.</p>

<p>"On some of the Continental lines the windows are wisely barred,
and in view of the liability to such unfortunate accidents, the
railway companies would do well to adopt some means for the
prevention of passengers leaning out of windows.</p>

<p>"The inquest will probably be held to-morrow."</p>

<p>Hazell laid down the paper, and sipped his lemonade
thoughtfully. It was one of his fads always to take lemonade with
his breakfast. Then he read the article through again, and pondered
yet more.</p>

<p>"Struck his head against a bridge, eh?" he said to himself.
"That's very curious. Wound on back of head and ear torn off. Umph,
I'd like to know a little more about this. Let's have a look at
Bradshaw&mdash;ah! I can catch that easily. It is not very far down
to Manningford, and I know something of Rolfe, the divisional
superintendent. It's worth the journey&mdash;and there's plenty of
time for ten minutes' dumb-bell exercise first."</p>

<p>Half an hour later he was in an express running down to
Manningford. As soon as he had passed Bridgeworth he opened the
window and kept a careful look out.</p>

<p>"Let's see," he said, "ah, of course, it would be the left side
of the train&mdash;here's the first bridge&mdash;" and he put his
head out and looked back&mdash;"plenty of space there. Well, we
shall see presently."</p>

<p>Altogether he counted four bridges between Bridgeworth and
Manningford. Arrived at the latter station, he made his way to the
office of the divisional superintendent and sent in his card. Five
minutes later he was talking with Rolfe.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the latter, "I expect I can easily guess what brings
you down here, Mr. Hazell. But I assure you it's not worth the
trouble of a journey. The thing's as plain as daylight."</p>

<p>"Oh, you think so, do you?" replied Hazell.</p>

<p>"Why, we've found out everything. There's no doubt that the poor
fellow put his head out of the window, and that the bridge caught
it as he ran through."</p>

<p>"Which bridge?"</p>

<p>"The second one from here."</p>

<p>"Indeed. And what makes you so certain about it?"</p>

<p>"Why, we've found all the necessary traces."</p>

<p>"And what were they?"</p>

<p>"Several bloodstains on the ballast of the permanent way and
sleepers. Just where one would have expected them to be; that is to
say, about ten to twenty yards this side of the bridge. The train
was running about fifty miles an hour, and the blood wouldn't drop
at the actual striking-place."</p>

<p>"Was there any trace on the bridge itself?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. But that's not at all necessary. Just the corner
would have struck him, you see."</p>

<p>"How about the missing piece of his ear?"</p>

<p>"That's been found, too. I tell you there is no mystery about
it. It's not in your line at all, Mr. Hazell."</p>

<p>"Ah, well&mdash;have you found the reason why he put his head so
far out of the window? For he must have stretched it out pretty
well to strike it against the bridge."</p>

<p>"Oh, really, Mr. Hazell, that's a mere detail. There are
hundreds of reasons why silly persons put their heads out of a
train window. You see it done every day."</p>

<p>"I daresay, but I'd like to know this reason. By the way, have
you found out who the man is yet?"</p>

<p>"Well, no. But there's been a police detective down, and I fancy
he has an inkling of something. The rumour is that the poor chap
was a Russian&mdash;used to travelling on the Siberian line, where
there are few bridges, I should think."</p>

<p>"Can I see him?"</p>

<p>"If you like. It's rather a gruesome sight. Come along." He took
Hazell to an office and unlocked the door.</p>

<p>"I'd rather not go in, if you don't mind," he said. "I've seen
enough already, and I'm squeamish about these things."</p>

<p>Hazell nodded, and went up to the table where the dead man lay,
covered with a sheet. He removed the sheet from his head, and
looked carefully at the wound. Then he seemed satisfied, and
rejoined his friend.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "I want to have a look at the bridge itself. May
I walk up the line?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you want the trouble. Stop a moment,
though&mdash;there's a goods train just starting&mdash;you can have
a lift in the brake, and I'll tell 'em to slow down for you to get
off. But you'll have to walk back."</p>

<p>"All right. When's the inquest?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>When Hazell got off the goods brake he found a young man
standing by the side of the line making a sketch of the bridge.
"Good-morning," said the latter. "Represent a paper?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm on the <i>Midland Courier</i>. We shall have a block in
tomorrow. Terrible thing. Seen the bloodstains?"</p>

<p>He was very young at his work, and Hazell, with a slight smile
at his impulsiveness, replied in the negative.</p>

<p>"Come along then, and I'll show them to you. They're quite
plain. Got a bit frozen, and it hasn't thawed to-day."</p>

<p>He took Hazell some twenty or thirty yards beyond the bridge,
and pointed out, on the frosty track, a few dark stains on the
ballast and ends of the sleepers.</p>

<p>"Must have been killed instantly," he went on, garrulously. "I
draw a bit, you see, so I'm making a sketch of the
affair&mdash;just at the moment when he struck his head against the
bridge."</p>

<p>"When he struck his head against the bridge," echoed Hazell,
thoughtfully. "Well, don't let me interrupt you. Look out, young
man, though, or there'll be a second accident!"</p>

<p>They had gone back to the up side of the bridge, and the young
reporter was standing on the line. Hazell had heard a signal fall,
and knew a train was coming. The other thanked him for his
warning.</p>

<p>"Just what I wanted," he said. "I shall get an impression of the
thing now."</p>

<p>Hazell carefully watched the train as it ran beneath the bridge.
Then he shook his head, and muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"Just what I thought. He'd have to lean out a tremendous
distance. And yet he must have been killed here. It's very
strange."</p>

<p>Here he looked at his watch, ate a plasmon biscuit, and solemnly
proceeded to go through an "exercise," for which purpose he took
off his coat. Having finished his little performance he set to work
to examine the edge of the brickwork. This proved unsatisfactory.
Then his gaze fell on the metals as he stood, just at the entrance
to the bridge, wrapped in thought.</p>

<p>Suddenly he appeared to catch sight of something on the line.
The next moment he was down on his hands and knees beside the
track. Close to the end of one of the sleepers, outside the left
hand rail, he had noticed a hole. That was all. Nothing very
curious, perhaps, but he knew very well that holes are never bored
in such places.</p>

<p>This one had evidently been done with an auger, for a few shreds
of wood were beside the sleeper. It was large enough for him to
insert his little finger, and he felt that there was a thread
inside. Something had been screwed into that hole.</p>

<p>"Found some more blood?" shouted the sanguinary-minded
youth.</p>

<p>Hazell shook his head as he stood up and looked overhead. The
sleeper with the hole in it was immediately below the edge of the
bridge. He looked long and intently at the bridge, marking with his
eyes an imaginary line straight up the brickwork from the hole in
the sleeper.</p>

<p>Apparently unsatisfied, he found his way to the top of the
bridge, and carefully examined the parapet. An exclamation of
triumph escaped him. About a foot above the roadway an exceedingly
strong staple had been driven into the brickwork, the fragments of
dislodged mortar lying on the ground. He measured a straight line
up from the staple to the top of the parapet, looked over, and
found the line would drop exactly perpendicular to the hole in the
sleeper. A careful examination of the staple revealed a tiny shred
of tow attached to it.</p>

<p>He waited patiently till another train was signalled, and then,
watching from the top of the parapet, he convinced himself that the
imaginary perpendicular line down to the sleeper would just clear
the sides of the carriages, as they ran by, by a few inches.</p>

<p>"Good!" he said. "I was certain it wasn't an accident."</p>

<p>He stood on the bridge, thinking, and taking in the surrounding
country. A farmhouse and a few scattered cottages stood a little
way back from the line and about a couple hundred yards from the
bridge. One or two other houses were in the distance. Then he
looked at the roadway, which was hard with the frost.</p>

<p>Suddenly he whistled softly to himself. There were tracks of a
bicycle coming up the bridge. The machine had evidently been leaned
against the parapet. And the rider had returned by the same road by
which he had come. There was his second track frozen into the road,
and not a sign of it on the other side of the bridge.</p>

<p>Few bicycles of any wear lack some distinguishing mark in the
tyres, and Hazell was soon satisfied, after a little examination,
that the ones in question were Clipper Reflex, and that a small bit
had been chipped out of the back tyre, making its mark plainly in
the road.</p>

<p>"How are you getting on?" he shouted to the reporter
presently.</p>

<p>"Just finished."</p>

<p>"Where does this road lead to?"</p>

<p>"It's only a bye road, and not much used. But you can get back
to Manningford by taking the first turning to the right. If you go
straight on it leads to Sandfield."</p>

<p>"Thanks. Nice frosty morning for a walk. I say, do you happen to
know when the frost set in in this part of the country?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It wasn't freezing at eight last night, when I went round
to my office for some late work, but it was quite hard at ten or so
when I came back."</p>

<p>"Thanks. Good morning."</p>

<p>"Good morning!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Hazell to himself, as he walked quickly away, "he
was a clumsy beggar to ride a soft road. The whole thing's as plain
as daylight, except just one point. How did he know the fellow
would put his head out of the window just in the right place?
There's a mystery in this, and I'd like to solve it before I say
anything to the police. At present we'll try the only clue there
seems to be."</p>

<p>The bicycle track did not branch off to Manningford, and Hazell
traced it for over eight miles along the road to Sandfield. He
broke the journey at a farmhouse, where he begged for a glass of
milk and a dry crust of bread. When he had partaken of this he
astonished the woman who had given it to him by lying down flat on
his back and rubbing his chest violently; after which he gave her
half-a-crown, and explained that "chest massage" was one of the
best aids to digestion. As he drew near Sandfield it became
difficult to follow the track, on account of the increased traffic,
but the frost was his best friend, and he persistently recovered
the traces.</p>

<p>At length they led him down a street on the outskirts of the
town, and stopped abruptly opposite a terrace of small houses. He
waited a moment or two in hesitation, not being quite sure which
house might prove the right one, and also wondering whether it were
not his duty to go straight to the police and tell them his
conjectures. But at that moment, a woman, who had been observing
him through one of the windows, came to the door and accosted
him.</p>

<p>"This is the house you're looking for, I think, sir?"</p>

<p>He turned towards her in surprise.</p>

<p>"The young man's very ill, sir, and I thought I'd better send
for you, me not knowin' anything about him, and feeling if so be as
anything was to happen to him it wouldn't be right not to have no
one to give a certificate, he bein' without friends, leastwise he
do get letters, but when I asked him to send for someone as knows
him he wouldn't hear of it, which I says I'd post a letter or even
write it for him. But he's obstinate, though I told him I'd send
for you, which they said you was out, sir, and would call when you
came home."</p>

<p>The woman paused to take breath, and Hazell fell in with the
situation.</p>

<p>"A lodger of yours, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Which he's only been with me a short time, and pays his rent
reg'lar, sir, though he is, seemingly, a furriner, which I never
could a-bear, sir, though he do speak the King's English quite as
good as you nor me."</p>

<p>Hazell smiled at her idea of grammar, and asked casually as he
went into the house:</p>

<p>"What's the matter with him?"</p>

<p>"It ain't for me to say, sir; but I lost a boy of my own with
conjecture of the lungs and browntitis, and I know what the
symptoms is, which he wouldn't take no care of hisself."</p>

<p>"Ah, been riding his bicycle in these cold east winds, eh?" went
on Hazell as his eyes fell on a machine in the hall.</p>

<p>"Only last night, sir, did he go out, which I told him was
arunnin' against Providence with his cough so bad as the neighbours
could hear it over the street."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go up and see him."</p>

<p>"Do so, sir&mdash;the first room on the left."</p>

<p>A sound of coughing struck upon his ears as he opened the door.
On the bed lay a young man with fair hair, slight moustache, and
hectic cheeks. He turned to Hazell and said feebly, and with a
foreign accent:</p>

<p>"Ah, you are the doctor, I suppose. Mrs. Bull insisted on
sending for you, but I'm afraid you can't do me very much
good."</p>

<p>Hazell locked the door very quietly on the inside, and came up
to the head of the bed.</p>

<p>"I'm not the doctor," he began, "though your landlady mistook me
for him."</p>

<p>The glow faded from the sick man's cheeks as he raised his head
from the pillow. "Who&mdash;who are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I can hardly explain. I'm scarcely a detective, being only a
private individual."</p>

<p>"What do you mean about being a detective?" gasped the
other.</p>

<p>"I mean that somewhere in this room&mdash;unless you threw them
away on the road&mdash;you have an auger, a hammer, a large staple
with a screw, and a length of very strong rope."</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed the sick man, "how did you find that
out?"</p>

<p>"By your own clumsiness. It was a clever thing to stretch that
rope from the bridge to the sleeper, but it was foolish to ride
your bicycle there in the mud with a frost about to set in."</p>

<p>A violent fit of coughing seized the man for a minute or two.
Hazell poured him out a drink of water, and looked at him
critically.</p>

<p>"You are very ill," he said.</p>

<p>"I know I am. I don't expect to get over it. What are you going
to do? Have me hanged if I live long enough?" he asked bitterly.
Hazell was silent.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't know who the man was who was found dead at
Manningford last night?"</p>

<p>Hazell shook his head.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you before you do anything. You say you're not a
detective, but I suppose you'll tell the police. I don't care.
Murder, was it? No, no, no. It was a just judgment and punishment.
If ever a man deserved his fate he did. Have you ever heard of Paul
Gourchoff?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"That was his name. One of the cruellest and most bloodthirsty
of all the Russian Police Agents, a man whose life was stained with
the foulest crimes. Shall I tell you about him?"</p>

<p>Hazell nodded.</p>

<p>"I will&mdash;and then I'll leave the issue in your hands, and
you can do as you please. I am a Pole&mdash;yes, you can understand
something of what I am by the mere word. It is enough for a Pole to
be loyal to his country and to labour for the cause of freedom, and
then he becomes&mdash;if he is fortunate enough to escape Siberia,
or prison, or death&mdash;an outcast, like myself.</p>

<p>"My father had a little estate; he was one of the old
nobility&mdash;we are of the Radziwill family, and he plotted,
secretly, as every patriot has to plot. This man, Gourchoff, was
one of us, trusted with all our plans, but in the pay of the
accursed Tsar all the time."</p>

<p>He waited his opportunity, and then&mdash;well, I will spare you
the details. My father died on the way to Siberia, a brother and
sister are there, somewhere, lost to name even&mdash;mere numbers,
being slowly done to death. One sister was killed before my
eyes&mdash;a brutal cossack cut her down with his sword. I was the
only one of the family that escaped, and that by a miracle.</p>

<p>"This was five years ago, and since that time I have devoted my
life to the cause here in England. There are many of us. Some come
over, secretly, from Poland, to keep in touch with those who work
in our country. We can do much here, but it is difficult.</p>

<p>"Two months ago a tremendous blow was struck at our
organisation. Paul Gourchoff came to England. He is like a sleuth
hound, and we knew that if he once tracked our meetings it would
mean death or exile to many of our friends in Poland.</p>

<p>"Can you wonder that we determined to take strong measures? Can
you wonder that I sought my opportunity for revenge? But he was
wily. He knew the danger, and it was impossible at first to do
anything, although every day he was discovering more and more and
running us down. Then I devised the plan which you seem to have
fathomed. And it was successful. Gourchoff is dead. Bah!"</p>

<p>Another fit of coughing succeeded. Then Hazell asked:</p>

<p>"But how did you make him put his head out of that window just
at the right spot?"</p>

<p>"I am coming to that. I came down here and took rooms, and he
was allowed to find out that I was in the neighbourhood. That was
the first step. His great plan was to discover the secret
rendezvous where we met our compatriots who came over.</p>

<p>"That remains a secret still!</p>

<p>"But it was not in London, and he knew it. So then we went to
work carefully. We had discovered that one of us, a man we had
never really trusted, was in his pay. Through this man we arranged
that he should receive information, which we apparently allowed to
leak out. At first the disclosure was made to him that we met in a
house somewhere near the London and Mid-Northern Railway in this
locality. This, of course, was false.</p>

<p>"Then we let it be known that our friends came to this
rendezvous in various ways, and that signals were arranged to show
them if it were safe. He fell into the trap beautifully. So we led
him to believe that a meeting was to be held last night, and that
two of our number were going from London. Between Bridgeworth and
Manningford they were to give a signal by holding a lantern out of
the window for a moment. This signal was to be answered by a green
light in the window of a certain house near the side of the line if
all was well, by a red light if there was danger. These lights were
to be flashed, and not stationary.</p>

<p>"Now we knew his object was simply to discover the house, with a
view to a raid on some subsequent occasion&mdash;oh! you little
know of the secret raids that are made by Russian police in
England&mdash;so that he would journey down alone.</p>

<p>"Our two friends were to get in the back of the train, and of
course he was to be allowed to see them get in. That insured that
he should go towards the front, and crane his head out of the
window between Bridgeworth and Manningford. We let it be thought
that the flash should take place from a window at the <i>side</i>
of the house, so that he would be looking back.</p>

<p>"Heaven knows how I managed that ride last night&mdash;it has
put the finishing stroke to a long illness. I had taken the most
careful measurements beforehand, and knew exactly where to drive
the staple in the brickwork, and where to bore the hole in the
sleeper. It didn't take me long to fix the rope very
tightly&mdash;I had it loose till just before the train was
due.</p>

<p>"As I stood on the top of the bridge I could see him with his
head reached out dimly in the darkness, while one of our friends at
the back was holding out a small lantern. I knew, by the sound,
that the rope had caught him, and I saw the other man draw in his
head quickly. I unscrewed the staple from the sleeper, but I
couldn't draw the other from the brickwork.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;that is the whole story. To my certain knowledge,
Paul Gourchoff has caused the death or exile of over two hundred
men and women, whose sole crime was patriotism and love of freedom.
Did he deserve to die?"</p>

<p>And Hazell, who had listened to the recital attentively, nodded
his head slowly.</p>

<p>"I think he did," he said.</p>

<p>Presently he added:</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Radziwill. "I don't think anyone can do that. In
your kindness you might leave me alone&mdash;that is all. I shall
cheat the gallows. There is enough money in my clothes here to bury
me. I have nothing to live for. Oh, do what you like!"</p>

<p>And he turned over and hid his face in the pillow. Hazell went
downstairs. Mrs. Bull was talking to a gentleman at the door.</p>

<p>"Which it's very strange, sir, you bein' the doctor as was sent
for, and yet another doctor's with him now, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll put that right," replied Hazell. "Your patient is waiting
to see you, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. Are you a friend of his?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es," replied Hazell. "I'd like to know what you think
of him, so I'll wait till you come down."</p>

<p>And what the doctor thought of him was this:</p>

<p>"He may last two or three days, but he won't see the week
out."</p>

<p>So Thorpe Hazell kept silence. He asked the doctor to direct him
to a vegetarian restaurant, where he lunched on a rice pudding and
a dish of prunes. Then he took the local train from Sandfield to
Manningford, and saw Rolfe once more before returning to town.</p>

<p>"Well," said the superintendent, "are you satisfied with your
investigation?"</p>

<p>"Quite," returned Hazell.</p>

<p>"Only an ordinary case, eh?"</p>

<p>"Only an ordinary case. I beg your pardon, Mr. Rolfe, but how
much do you weigh?"</p>

<p>"Fourteen stone, I believe," replied the official, with a
puzzled air.</p>

<p>"And you are about five feet six, I should imagine," went on
Hazell, looking at him critically. "You really ought to reduce some
of it. Try living on lentils for a fortnight; and a very excellent
exercise is this&mdash;I do it before most meals&mdash;take three
deep breaths through the nostrils, filling the lungs and letting
the air escape through the mouth slowly. At the same time rise on
the toes, reach the hands above the head, and bring them slowly
down to the sides. Repeat fifteen times. It's a capital thing for
digestion. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Two days later came the result of the inquest. Verdict,
"Accidental death, with a recommendation from the jury that the
railway officials should carefully examine the width of all their
bridges, and take steps, if necessary, to avoid the occurrence of
such a painful tragedy."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>THE AFFAIR OF THE CORRIDOR
EXPRESS</h2>

<p>Thorpe Hazell stood in his study in his London flat. On the
opposite wall he had pinned a bit of paper, about an inch square,
at the height of his eye, and was now going through the most
extraordinary contortions.</p>

<p>With his eyes fixed on the paper he was craning his neck as far
as it would reach and twisting his head about in all directions.
This necessitated a fearful rolling of the eyes in order to keep
them on the paper, and was supposed to be a means of strengthening
the muscles of the eye for angular sight.</p>

<p>Presently there came a tap at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" cried Hazell, still whirling his head round.</p>

<p>"A gentleman wishes to see you at once, sir!" said the servant,
handing him a card.</p>

<p>Hazell paused in his exercises, took it from the tray, and
read:</p>

<blockquote>"Mr. F. W. Wingrave, M.A., B.Sc."</blockquote>

<p>"Oh, show him in," said Hazell, rather impatiently, for he hated
to be interrupted when he was doing his "eye gymnastics."</p>

<p>There entered a young man of about five-and-twenty, with a look
of keen anxiety on his face. "You are Mr. Thorpe Hazell?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"You will have seen my name on my card&mdash;I am one of the
masters at Shillington School&mdash;I had heard your name, and they
told me at the station that it might be well to consult you&mdash;I
hope you don't mind&mdash;I know you're not an ordinary detective,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Wingrave," said Hazell, interrupting his nervous
flow of language. "You look quite ill and tired."</p>

<p>"I have just been through a very trying experience," replied
Wingrave, sinking into a seat. "A boy I was in charge of has just
mysteriously disappeared, and I want you to find him for me, and I
want to ask your opinion. They say you know all about railways,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, look here, my dear sir, you just have some hot toast and
water before you say another word. I conclude you want to consult
me on some railway matter. I'll do what I can, but I won't hear you
till you've had some refreshment. Perhaps you prefer
whiskey&mdash;though I don't advise it."</p>

<p>Wingrave, however, chose the whiskey, and Hazell poured him out
some, adding soda-water.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. "I hope you'll be able to give me advice.
I am afraid the poor boy must be killed; the whole thing is a
mystery, and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop a bit, Mr. Wingrave. I must ask you to tell me the story
from the very beginning. That's the best way."</p>

<p>"Quite right. The worry of it has made me incoherent, I fear.
But I'll try and do what you propose. First of all, do you know the
name of Carr-Mathers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. Very rich is he not?"</p>

<p>"A millionaire. He has only one child, a boy of about ten, whose
mother died at his birth. He is a small boy for his age, and
idolised by his father. About three months ago this young Horace
Carr-Mathers was sent to our school&mdash;Cragsbury House, just
outside Shillington. It is not a very large school, but exceedingly
select, and the headmaster, Dr. Spring, is well known in high-class
circles. I may tell you that we have the sons of some of the
leading nobility preparing for the public schools. You will readily
understand that in such an establishment as ours the most
scrupulous care is exercised over the boys, not only as regards
their moral and intellectual training, but also to guard against
any outside influences."</p>

<p>"Kidnapping, for example," interposed Hazell.</p>

<p>"Exactly. There have been such cases known, and Dr. Spring has a
very high reputation to maintain. The slightest rumour against the
school would go ill with him&mdash;and with all of us masters.</p>

<p>"Well, this morning the headmaster received a telegram about
Horace Carr-Mathers, requesting that he should be sent up to
town."</p>

<p>"Do you know the exact wording?" asked Hazell.</p>

<p>"I have it with me," replied Wingrave, drawing it from his
pocket.</p>

<p>Hazell took it from him, and read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>"Please grant Horace leave of absence for two days.
Send him to London by 5.45 express from Shillington, in first-class
carriage, giving guard instructions to look after him. We will meet
train in town.&mdash;Carr-Mathers."</i>
</blockquote>

<p>"Um," grunted Hazell, as he handed it back. "Well, he can afford
long telegrams."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's always wiring about something or other," replied
Wingrave; "he seldom writes a letter. Well, when the doctor
received this he called me into his study.</p>

<p>"'I suppose I must let the boy go,' he said, 'but I'm not at all
inclined to allow him to travel by himself. If anything should
happen to him his father would hold us responsible as well as the
railway company. So you had better take him up to town, Mr.
Wingrave.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>"'You need do no more than deliver him to his father. If Mr.
Carr-Mathers is not at the terminus to meet him, take him with you
in a cab to his house in Portland Place. You'll probably be able to
catch the last train home, but, if not, you can get a bed at an
hotel.'</p>

<p>"'Very good, sir.'</p>

<p>"So, shortly after half-past five, I found myself standing on
the platform at Shillington, waiting for the London express."</p>

<p>"Now, stop a moment," interrupted Hazell, sipping a glass of
filtered water which he had poured out for himself. "I want to get
a clear notion of this journey of yours from the beginning, for, I
presume, you will shortly be telling me that something strange
happened during it. Was there anything to be noticed before the
train started?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at the time. But I remembered afterwards that two men
seemed to be watching me rather closely when I took the tickets,
and I heard one of them say 'Confound,' beneath his breath. But my
suspicions were not aroused at the moment."</p>

<p>"I see. If there is anything in this it was probably because he
was disconcerted when he saw you were going to travel with the boy.
Did these two men get into the train?"</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that. The train was in sharp to time, and we took
our seats in a first-class compartment."</p>

<p>"Please describe the exact position."</p>

<p>"Our carriage was the third from the front. It was a corridor
train, with access from carriage to carriage all the way through.
Horace and myself were in a compartment alone. I had bought him
some illustrated papers for the journey, and for some time he sat
quietly enough, looking through them. After a bit he grew fidgety,
as you know boys will."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. I want to know if the corridor of your carriage
was on the left or on the right&mdash;supposing you to be seated
facing the engine?"</p>

<p>"On the left."</p>

<p>"Very well, go on."</p>

<p>"The door leading into the corridor stood open. It was still
daylight, but dusk was setting in fast&mdash;I should say it was
about half-past six, or a little more. Horace had been looking out
of the window on the right side of the train when I drew his
attention to Rutherham Castle, which we were passing. It stands, as
you know, on the left side of the line. In order to get a better
view of it he went out into the corridor and stood there. I
retained my seat on the right side of the compartment, glancing at
him from time to time. He seemed interested in the corridor itself,
looking about him, and once or twice shutting and opening the door
of our compartment. I can see now that I ought to have kept a
sharper eye on him, but I never dreamed that any accident could
happen. I was reading a paper myself, and became rather interested
in a paragraph. It may have been seven or eight minutes before I
looked up. When I did so, Horace had disappeared.</p>

<p>"I didn't think anything of it at first, but only concluded that
he had taken a walk along the corridor."</p>

<p>"You don't know which way he went?" inquired Hazell.</p>

<p>"No. I couldn't say. I waited a minute or two, and then rose and
looked out into the corridor. There was no one there. Still my
suspicions were not aroused. It was possible that he had gone to
the lavatory. So I sat down again, and waited. Then I began to get
a little anxious, and determined to have a look for him. I walked
to either end of the corridor, and searched the lavatories, but
they were both empty. Then I looked in all the other compartments
of the carriage, and asked their occupants if they had seen him go
by, but none of them had noticed him."</p>

<p>"Do you remember how these compartments were occupied?"</p>

<p>"Yes. In the first, which was reserved for ladies, there were
five ladies. The next was a smoker with three gentlemen in it. Ours
came next. Then, going towards the front of the train, were the two
men I had noticed at Shillington; the last compartment had a
gentleman and lady and their three children."</p>

<p>"Ah! how about those two men&mdash;what were they doing?"</p>

<p>"One of them was reading a book, and the other appeared to be
asleep."</p>

<p>"Tell me. Was the door leading to the corridor from their
compartment shut?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"Well, I was in a most terrible fright, and I went back to my
compartment and pulled the electric communicator. In a few seconds
the front guard came along the corridor and asked me what I wanted.
I told him I had lost my charge. He suggested that the boy had
walked through to another carriage, and I asked him if he would
mind my making a thorough search of the train with him. To this he
readily agreed. We went back to the first carriage and began to do
so. We examined every compartment from end to end of the train; we
looked under every seat, in spite of the protestations of some of
the passengers; we searched all the lavatories&mdash;every corner
of the train&mdash;and we found absolutely no trace of Horace
Carr-Mathers. No one had seen the boy anywhere."</p>

<p>"Had the train stopped?"</p>

<p>"Not for a second. It was going at full speed all the time. It
only slowed down after we had finished the search&mdash;but it
never quite stopped."</p>

<p>"Ah! We'll come to that presently. I want to ask you some
questions first. Was it still daylight?"</p>

<p>"Dusk, but quite light enough to see plainly&mdash;besides
which, the train lamps were lit."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Those two men, now, in the next compartment to
yours&mdash;tell me precisely what happened when you visited them
the second time with the guard."</p>

<p>"They asked a lot of questions&mdash;like many of the other
passengers&mdash;and seemed very surprised."</p>

<p>"You looked underneath their seats?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"On the luggage-racks? A small boy like that could be rolled up
in a rug and put on the rack."</p>

<p>"We examined every rack on the train."</p>

<p>Thorpe Hazell lit a cigarette and smoked furiously, motioning to
his companion to keep quiet. He was thinking out the situation.
Suddenly he said:</p>

<p>"How about the window in those two men's compartment?"</p>

<p>"It was shut&mdash;I particularly noticed it."</p>

<p>"You are <i>quite</i> sure you searched the whole of the
train?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely certain; so was the guard."</p>

<p>"Ah!" remarked Hazell, "even guards are mistaken sometimes.
It&mdash;er&mdash;was only the inside of the train you searched,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Hazell, "now, before we go any further, I
want to ask you this. Would it have been to anyone's interest to
have murdered the boy?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so&mdash;from what I know. I don't see how it
could be."</p>

<p>"Very well. We will take it as a pure case of kidnapping, and
presume that he is alive and well. This ought to console you to
begin with."</p>

<p>"Do you think you can help me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet. But go on and tell me all that happened."</p>

<p>"Well, after we had searched the train I was at my wits'
end&mdash;and so was the guard. We both agreed, however, that
nothing more could be done till we reached London. Somehow, my
strongest suspicions concerning those two men were aroused, and I
travelled in their compartment for the rest of the journey."</p>

<p>"Oh! Did anything happen?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. They both wished me good-night, hoped I'd find the
boy, got out, and drove off in a hansom."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"I looked about for Mr. Carr-Mathers, but he was nowhere to be
seen. Then I saw an inspector, and put the case before him. He
promised to make inquiries and to have the line searched on the
part where I missed Horace. I took a hansom to Portland Place, only
to discover that Mr. Carr-Mathers is on the Continent and not
expected home for a week. Then I came on to you&mdash;the inspector
had advised me to do so. And that's the whole story. It's a
terrible thing for me, Mr. Hazell. What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Hazell, "of course it's very clear that there is
a distinct plot. Someone sent that telegram, knowing Mr.
Carr-Mathers' proclivities. The object was to kidnap the boy. It
sounds absurd to talk of brigands and ransoms in this country, but
the thing is done over and over again for all that. It is obvious
that the boy was expected to travel alone, and that the train was
the place chosen for the kidnapping. Hence the elaborate
directions. I think you were quite right in suspecting those two
men, and it might have been better if you had followed them up
without coming to me."</p>

<p>"But they went off alone!"</p>

<p>"Exactly. It's my belief they had originally intended doing so
after disposing of Horace, and that they carried out their original
intentions."</p>

<p>"But what became of the boy?&mdash;how did they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop a bit. I'm not at all clear in my own mind. But you
mentioned that while you were concluding your search with the guard
the train slackened speed?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It almost came to a stop&mdash;and then went very slowly
for a minute or so. I asked the guard why, but I didn't understand
his reply."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"He said it was a P.W. operation."</p>

<p>Hazell laughed.</p>

<p>"P.W. stands for permanent way," he explained, "I know exactly
what you mean now. There is a big job going on near
Longmoor&mdash;they are raising the level of the line, and the
up-trains are running on temporary rails. So they have to proceed
very slowly. Now it was after this that you went back to the two
men whom you suspected?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well. Now let me think the thing over. Have some more
whiskey? You might also like to glance at the contents of my
bookcase. If you know anything of first editions and bindings they
will interest you."</p>

<p>Wingrave, it is to be feared, paid but small heed to the books,
but watched Hazell anxiously as the latter smoked cigarette after
cigarette, his brows knit in deep thought. After a bit he said
slowly:</p>

<p>"You will understand that I am going to work upon the theory
that the boy has been kidnapped and that the original intention has
been carried out, in spite of the accident of your presence in the
train. How the boy was disposed of meanwhile is what baffles me;
but that is a detail&mdash;though it will be interesting to know
how it was done. Now, I don't want to raise any false hopes,
because I may very likely be wrong, but we are going to take action
upon a very feasible assumption, and if I am at all correct, I hope
to put you definitely on the track. Mind, I don't promise to do so,
and, at best, I don't promise to do more than put you on a track.
Let me see&mdash;it's just after nine. We have plenty of time.
We'll drive first to Scotland Yard, for it will be as well to have
a detective with us."</p>

<p>He filled a flask with milk, put some plasmon biscuits and a
banana into a sandwich case, and then ordered his servant to hail a
cab.</p>

<p>An hour later, Hazell, Wingrave, and a man from Scotland Yard
were closeted together in one of the private offices of the
Mid-Eastern Railway with one of the chief officials of the line.
The latter was listening attentively to Hazell.</p>

<p>"But I can't understand the boy not being anywhere in the train,
Mr. Hazell," he said.</p>

<p>"I can&mdash;partly," replied Hazell, "but first let me see if
my theory is correct."</p>

<p>"By all means. There's a down-train in a few minutes. I'll go
with you, for the matter is very interesting. Come along,
gentlemen."</p>

<p>He walked forward to the engine and gave a few instructions to
the driver, and then they took their seats in the train. After a
run of half an hour or so they passed a station.</p>

<p>"That's Longmoor," said the official, "now we shall soon be on
the spot. It's about a mile down that the line is being
raised."</p>

<p>Hazell put his head out of the window. Presently an ominous red
light showed itself. The train came almost to a stop, and then
proceeded slowly, the man who had shown the red light changing it
to green. They could see him as they passed, standing close to a
little temporary hut. It was his duty to warn all approaching
drivers, and for this purpose he was stationed some three hundred
yards in front of the bit of line that was being operated upon.
Very soon they were passing this bit. Naphtha lamps shed a weird
light over a busy scene, for the work was being continued night and
day. A score or so of sturdy navvies were shovelling and picking
along the track.</p>

<p>Once more into the darkness. On the other side of the scene of
operations, at the same distance, was another little hut, with a
guardian for the up-train. Instead of increasing the speed in
passing this hut, which would have been usual, the driver brought
the train almost to a standstill. As he did so the four men got out
of the carriage, jumping from the footboard to the ground. On went
the train, leaving them on the left side of the down track, just
opposite the little hut. They could see the man standing outside,
his back partly turned to them. There was a fire in a brazier close
by that dimly outlined his figure.</p>

<p>He started suddenly, as they crossed the line towards him.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he cried. "You've no business
here&mdash;you're trespassing."</p>

<p>He was a big, strong-looking man, and he backed a little towards
his hut as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Mills, the assistant-superintendent of the line,"
replied the official, coming forward.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir; but how was I to know that?" growled the
man.</p>

<p>"Quite right. It's your duty to warn off strangers. How long
have you been stationed here?"</p>

<p>"I came on at five o'clock; I'm regular night-watchman,
sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! Pretty comfortable, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you, sir," replied the man, wondering why the
question was asked, but thinking, not unnaturally, that the
assistant-superintendent had come down with a party of engineers to
inspect things.</p>

<p>"Got the hut to yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Without another word, Mr. Mills walked to the door of the hut.
The man, his face suddenly growing pale, moved, and stood with his
back to it.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's private, sir!" he growled.</p>

<p>Hazell laughed.</p>

<p>"All right, my man," he said. "I was right, I
think&mdash;hullo!&mdash;Look out! Don't let him go!"</p>

<p>For the man had made a quick rush forward. But the Scotland Yard
officer and Hazell were on him in a moment, and a few seconds later
the handcuffs clicked on his wrists. Then they flung the door open,
and there, lying in the corner, gagged and bound, was Horace
Carr-Mathers.</p>

<p>An exclamation of joy broke forth from Wingrave, as he opened
his knife to cut the cords. But Hazell stopped him.</p>

<p>"Just half a moment," he said: "I want to see how they've tied
him up."</p>

<p>A peculiar method had been adopted in doing this. His wrists
were fastened behind his back, a stout cord was round his body just
under the armpits, and another cord above the knees. These were
connected by a slack bit of rope.</p>

<p>"All right!" went on Hazell; "let's get the poor lad out of his
troubles&mdash;there, that's better. How do you feel, my boy?"</p>

<p>"Awfully stiff!" said Horace, "but I'm not hurt. I say, sir," he
continued to Wingrave, "how did you know I was here? I <i>am</i>
glad you've come."</p>

<p>"The question is how did you <i>get</i> here?" replied Wingrave.
"Mr. Hazell, here, seemed to know where you were, but it's a puzzle
to me at present."</p>

<p>"If you'd come half an hour later you wouldn't have found him,"
growled the man who was handcuffed. "I ain't so much to blame as
them as employed me."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that how the land lies?" exclaimed Hazell. "I see. You
shall tell us presently, my boy, how it happened. Meanwhile, Mr.
Mills, I think we can prepare a little trap&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>In five minutes all was arranged. A couple of the navvies were
brought up from the line, one stationed outside to guard against
trains, and with certain other instructions, the other being inside
the hut with the rest of them. A third navvy was also dispatched
for the police.</p>

<p>"How are they coming?" asked Hazell of the handcuffed man.</p>

<p>"They were going to take a train down from London to
Rockhampstead on the East-Northern, and drive over. It's about ten
miles off."</p>

<p>"Good! they ought soon to be here," replied Hazell, as he
munched some biscuits and washed them down with a draught of milk,
after which he astonished them all by solemnly going through one of
his "digestive exercises."</p>

<p>A little later they heard the sound of wheels on a road beside
the line. Then the man on watch said, in gruff tones:</p>

<p>"The boy's inside!"</p>

<p>But they found more than the boy inside, and an hour later all
three conspirators were safely lodged in Longmoor gaol.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was awfully nasty, I can tell you," said Horace
Carr-Mathers, as he explained matters afterwards. "I went into the
corridor, you know, and was looking about at things, when all of a
sudden I felt my coat-collar grasped behind, and a hand was laid
over my mouth. I tried to kick and shout, but it was no go. They
got me into the compartment, stuffed a handkerchief into my mouth,
and tied it in. It was just beastly. Then they bound me hand and
foot, and opened the window on the right-hand side&mdash;opposite
the corridor. I was in a funk, for I thought they were going to
throw me out, but one of them told me to keep my pecker up, as they
weren't going to hurt me. Then they let me down out of the window
by that slack rope, and made it fast to the handle of the door
outside. It was pretty bad. There was I, hanging from the
door-handle in a sort of doubled-up position, my back resting on
the footboard of the carriage, and the train rushing along like
mad. I felt sick and awful, and I had to shut my eyes. I seemed to
hang there for ages."</p>

<p>"I told you, you only examined the <i>inside</i> of the train,"
said Thorpe Hazell to Wingrave. "I had my suspicions that he was
somewhere on the outside all the time, but I was puzzled to know
where. It was a clever trick."</p>

<p>"Well," went on the boy, "I heard the window open above me after
a bit. I looked up and saw one of the men taking the rope off the
handle. The train was just beginning to slow down. Then he hung out
of the window, dangling me with one hand. It was horrible. I was
hanging below the footboard now. Then the train came almost to a
stop, and someone caught me round the waist. I lost my senses for a
minute or two, and then I found myself lying in the hut."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Hazell," said the assistant-superintendent, "you were
perfectly right, and we all owe you a debt of gratitude."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Hazell, "it was only a guess at the best. I presumed
it was simply kidnapping, and the problem to be solved was how and
where the boy was got off the train without injury. It was obvious
that he had been disposed of before the train reached London. There
was only one other inference. The man on duty was evidently the
confederate, for, if not, his presence would have stopped the whole
plan of action. I'm very glad to have been of any use. There are
interesting points about the case, and it has been a pleasure to me
to undertake it."</p>

<p>A little while afterwards Mr. Carr-Mathers himself called on
Hazell to thank him.</p>

<p>"I should like," he said, "to express my deep gratitude
substantially; but I understand you are not an ordinary detective.
But is there any way in which I can serve you, Mr. Hazell?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;two ways."</p>

<p>"Please name them."</p>

<p>"I should be sorry for Mr. Wingrave to get into trouble through
this affair&mdash;or Dr. Spring either."</p>

<p>"I understand you, Mr. Hazell. They were both to blame, in a
way. But I will see that Dr. Spring's reputation does not suffer,
and that Wingrave comes out of it harmlessly."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much."</p>

<p>"You said there was a second way in which I could serve
you."</p>

<p>"So there is. At Dunn's sale last month you were the purchaser
of two first editions of 'The New Bath Guide.' If you cared to
dispose of one, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say no more, Mr. Hazell. I shall be glad to give you one for
your collection."</p>

<p>Hazell stiffened.</p>

<p>"You misunderstand me!" he exclaimed icily. "I was about to add
that if you cared to dispose of a copy I would write you out a
cheque."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," replied Mr. Carr-Mathers with a smile, "I shall
be extremely pleased."</p>

<p>Whereupon the transaction was concluded.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>SIR GILBERT MURRELL'S
PICTURE</h2>

<p>The affair of the goods truck on the Didcot and Newbury branch
of the Great Western Railway was of singular interest, and found a
prominent place in Thorpe Hazell's notebook. It was owing partly to
chance, and partly to Hazell's sagacity, that the main incidents in
the story were discovered, but he always declared that the chief
interest to his mind was the unique method by which a very daring
plan was carried out.</p>

<p>He was staying with a friend at Newbury at the time, and had
taken his camera down with him, for he was a bit of an amateur
photographer as well as book-lover, though his photos generally
consisted of trains and engines. He had just come in from a
morning's ramble with his camera slung over his shoulder, and was
preparing to partake of two plasmon biscuits, when his friend met
him in the hail.</p>

<p>"I say, Hazell," he began, "you're just the fellow they want
here."</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked Hazell, taking off his camera and commencing
some "exercises."</p>

<p>"I've just been down to the station. I know the station-master
very well, and he tells me an awfully queer thing happened on the
line last night."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"On the Didcot branch. It's a single line, you know, running
through the Berkshire Downs to Didcot."</p>

<p>Hazell smiled, and went on whirling his arms round his head.</p>

<p>"Kind of you to give me the information," he said, "but I happen
to know the line. But what's occurred?"</p>

<p>"Well, it appears a goods train left Didcot last night bound
through to Winchester, and that one of the waggons never arrived
here at Newbury."</p>

<p>"Not very much in that," replied Hazell, still at his
"exercises," "unless the waggon in question was behind the brake
and the couplings snapped, in which case the next train along might
have run into it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. The waggon was in the middle of the train."</p>

<p>"Probably left in a siding by mistake," replied Hazell.</p>

<p>"But the station-master says that all the stations along the
line have been wired to, and that it isn't at any of them."</p>

<p>"Very likely it never left Didcot."</p>

<p>"He declares there is no doubt about that."</p>

<p>"Well, you begin to interest me," replied Hazell, stopping his
whirligigs and beginning to eat his plasmon. "There may be
something in it, though very often a waggon is mislaid. But I'll go
down to the station."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you, Hazell, and introduce you to the
stationmaster. He has heard of your reputation."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later they were in the station-master's office,
Hazell having re-slung his camera.</p>

<p>"Very glad to meet you," said that functionary, "for this affair
promises to be mysterious. <i>I</i> can't make it out at all."</p>

<p>"Do you know what the truck contained?"</p>

<p>"That's just where the bother comes in, sir. It was valuable
property. There's a loan exhibition of pictures at Winchester next
week, and this waggon was bringing down some of them from
Leamington. They belong to Sir Gilbert Murrell&mdash;three of them,
I believe&mdash;large pictures, and each in a separate
packing-case."</p>

<p>"H'm&mdash;this sounds very funny. Are you sure the truck was on
the train?"</p>

<p>"Simpson, the brakesman, is here now, and I'll send for him.
Then you can hear the story in his own words."</p>

<p>So the goods guard appeared on the scene. Hazell looked at him
narrowly, but there was nothing suspicious in his honest face.</p>

<p>"I know the waggon was on the train when we left Didcot," he
said in answer to inquiries, "and I noticed it at Upton, the next
station, where we took a couple off. It was the fifth or sixth in
front of my brake. I'm quite certain of that. We stopped at Compton
to take up a cattle truck, but I didn't get out there. Then we ran
right through to Newbury, without stopping at the other stations,
and then I discovered that the waggon was not on the train. I
thought very likely it might have been left at Upton or Compton by
mistake, but I was wrong, for they say it isn't there. That's all I
know about it, sir. A rum go, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Extraordinary!" exclaimed Hazell. "You must have made a
mistake."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I'm sure I haven't."</p>

<p>"Did the driver of the train notice anything?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, but the thing's impossible," said Hazell. "A loaded
waggon couldn't have been spirited away. What time was it when you
left Didcot?"</p>

<p>"About eight o'clock, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;quite dark. You noticed nothing along the line?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir."</p>

<p>"You were in your brake all the time, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;while we were running."</p>

<p>At this moment there came a knock at the station-master's door
and a porter entered.</p>

<p>"There's a passenger train just in from the Didcot branch," said
the man, "and the driver reports that he saw a truck loaded with
packing-cases in Churn siding."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blowed!" exclaimed the brakesman. "Why, we ran
through Churn without a stop&mdash;trains never do stop there
except in camp time."</p>

<p>"Where is Churn?" asked Hazell, for once at a loss.</p>

<p>"It's merely a platform and a siding close to the camping ground
between Upton and Compton," replied the station-master, "for the
convenience of troops only, and very rarely used except in the
summer, when soldiers are encamped there."*</p>

<p>[* The incident here recorded occurred before June, 1905, in
which month Churn was dignified with a place in Bradshaw as a
"station" at which trains stop by signal.&mdash;V. L. W.]</p>

<p>"I should very much like to see the place, and as soon as
possible," said Hazell.</p>

<p>"So you shall," replied the station-master. "A train will soon
start on the branch. Inspector Hill shall go with you, and
instruction shall be given to the driver to stop there, while a
return train can pick you both up."</p>

<p>In less than an hour Hazell and Inspector Hill alighted at
Churn. It is a lonely enough place, situated in a vast flat basin
of the Downs, scarcely relieved by a single tree, and far from all
human habitation with the exception of a lonely shepherd's cottage
some half a mile away.</p>

<p>The "station" itself is only a single platform, with a shelter
and a solitary siding, terminating in what is known in railway
language as a "dead end"&mdash;that is, in this case, wooden
buffers to stop any trucks. This siding runs off from the single
line of rail at points from the Didcot direction of the line.</p>

<p>And in this siding was the lost truck, right against the "dead
end," filled with three packing-cases, and labeled "Leamington to
Winchester, via Newbury." There could be no doubt about it at all.
But how it had got there from the middle of a train running through
without a stop was a mystery even to the acute mind of Thorpe
Hazell.</p>

<p>"Well," said the inspector when they had gazed long enough at
the truck; "we'd better have a look at the points. Come along."</p>

<p>There is not even a signal-box at this primitive station. The
points are actuated by two levers in a ground frame, standing close
by the side of the line, one lever unlocking and the other shifting
the same points.</p>

<p>"How about these points?" said Hazell as they drew near. "You
only use them so occasionally, that I suppose they are kept out of
action?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the inspector, "a block of wood is bolted
down between the end of the point rail and the main rail, fixed as
a wedge&mdash;ah! there it is, you see, quite untouched; and the
levers themselves are locked&mdash;here's the keyhole in the ground
frame. This is the strangest thing I've ever come across, Mr.
Hazell."</p>

<p>Thorpe Hazell stood looking at the points and levers sorely
puzzled. They must have been worked to get that truck in the
siding, he knew well. But how?</p>

<p>Suddenly his face lit up. Oil evidently had been used to loosen
the nut of the bolt that fixed the wedge of wood. Then his eyes
fell on the handle of one of the two levers, and a slight
exclamation of joy escaped him.</p>

<p>"Look," said the inspector at that moment, "it's impossible to
pull them off," and he stretched out his hand towards a lever. To
his astonishment Hazell seized him by the collar and dragged him
back before he could touch it.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he exclaimed, "hope I've not hurt you, but
I want to photograph those levers first, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>The inspector watched him rather sullenly as he fixed his camera
on a folding tripod stand he had with him, only a few inches from
the handle of one of the levers, and took two very careful
photographs of it.</p>

<p>"Can't see the use of that, sir," growled the inspector. But
Hazell vouchsafed no reply.</p>

<p>"Let him find it out for himself," he thought.</p>

<p>Then he said aloud:</p>

<p>"I fancy they must have had that block out, inspector&mdash;and
it's evident the points must have been set to get the truck where
it is. How it was done is a problem, but if the doer of it was
anything of a regular criminal, I think we might find
<i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"How?" asked the puzzled inspector.</p>

<p>"Ah," was the response, "I'd rather not say at present. Now, I
should very much like to know whether those pictures are
intact?"</p>

<p>"We shall soon find that out," replied the inspector, "for we'll
take the truck back with us." And he commenced undoing the bolt
with a spanner, after which he unlocked the levers.</p>

<p>"H'm&mdash;they work pretty freely," he remarked as he pulled
one.</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Hazell, "they've been oiled recently."</p>

<p>There was an hour or so before the return train would pass, and
Hazell occupied it by walking to the shepherd's cottage.</p>

<p>"I am hungry," he explained to the woman there, "and hunger is
Nature's dictate for food. Can you oblige me with a couple of
onions and a broomstick?"</p>

<p>And she talks to-day of the strange man who "kept a swingin' o'
that there broomstick round 'is 'ead and then eat them onions as
solemn as a judge."</p>

<p>The first thing Hazell did on returning to Newbury was to
develop his photographs. The plates were dry enough by the evening
for him to print one or two photos on gaslight-paper and to enclose
the clearest of them with a letter to a Scotland Yard official whom
he knew, stating that he would call for an answer, as he intended
returning to town in a couple of days. The following evening he
received a note from the station-master, which read&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>Dear Sir,<br>
<br>
I promised to let you know if the pictures in the cases on that
truck were in any way tampered with. I have just received a report
from Winchester by which I understand that they have been unpacked
and carefully examined by the Committee of the Loan Exhibition. The
Committee are perfectly satisfied that they have not been damaged
or interfered with in any way, and that they have been received
just as they left the owner's hands.<br>
<br>
We are still at a loss to account for the running of the waggon on
to Churn siding or for the object in doing so. An official has been
down from Paddington, and, at his request, we are not making the
affair public&mdash;the goods having arrived in safety. I am sure
you will observe confidence in this matter.</blockquote>

<p>"More mysterious than ever," said Hazell to himself. "I can't
understand it at all."</p>

<p>The next day he called at Scotland Yard and saw the
official.</p>

<p>"I've had no difficulty with your little matter, you'll be glad
to hear," he said. "We looked up our records and very soon spotted
your man."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"His real name is Edgar Jeffreys, but we know him under several
aliases. He's served four sentences for burglary and
robbery&mdash;the latter, a daring theft from a train, so he's in
your line, Mr. Hazell. What's he been up to, and how did you get
that print?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Hazell, "I don't quite know yet what he's been
doing. But I should like to be able to find him if anything turns
up. Never mind how I got the print&mdash;the affair is quite a
private one at present, and nothing may come of it."</p>

<p>The official wrote an address on a bit of paper and handed it to
Hazell.</p>

<p>"He's living there just now, under the name of Allen. We keep
such men in sight, and I'll let you know if he moves."</p>

<p>When Hazell opened his paper the following morning he gave a cry
of joy. And no wonder, for this is what he saw:</p>

<p align="center">MYSTERY OF A PICTURE.<br>
SIR GILBERT MURRELL AND THE WINCHESTER LOAN EXHIBITION.<br>
AN EXTRAORDINARY CHARGE.</p>

<p>The Committee of the Loan Exhibition of Pictures to be opened
next week at Winchester are in a state of very natural excitement
brought about by a strange charge that has been made against them
by Sir Gilbert Murrell.</p>

<p>Sir Gilbert, who lives at Leamington, is the owner of several
very valuable pictures, among them being the celebrated "Holy
Family," by Velasquez. This picture, with two others, was
dispatched by him from Leamington to be exhibited at Winchester,
and yesterday he journeyed to that city in order to make himself
satisfied with the hanging arrangements, as he had particularly
stipulated that "The Holy Family" was to be placed in a prominent
position.</p>

<p>The picture in question was standing on the floor of the
gallery, leaning against a pillar, when Sir Gilbert arrived with
some representatives of the Committee.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred till he happened to walk behind the canvas,
when he astounded those present by saying that the picture was not
his at all, declaring that a copy had been substituted, and stating
that he was absolutely certain on account of certain private marks
of his at the back of the canvas which were quite indecipherable,
and which were now missing. He admitted that the painting itself in
every way resembled his picture, and that it was the cleverest
forgery he had ever seen; but a very painful scene took place, the
hanging committee stating that the picture had been received by
them from the railway company just as it stood.</p>

<p>At present the whole affair is a mystery, but Sir Gilbert
insisted most emphatically to our correspondent, who was able to
see him, that the picture was certainly not his, and said that as
the original is extremely valuable he intends holding the Committee
responsible for the substitution which, he declares, has taken
place.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>It was evident to Hazell that the papers had not, as yet, got
hold of the mysterious incident at Churn. As a matter of fact, the
railway company had kept that affair strictly to themselves, and
the loan committee knew nothing of what had happened on the
line.</p>

<p>But Hazell saw that inquiries would be made, and determined to
probe the mystery without delay. He saw at once that if there was
any truth in Sir Gilbert's story the substitution had taken place
in that lonely siding at Churn. He was staying at his London flat,
and five minutes after he had read the paragraph had called a
hansom and was being hurried off to a friend of his who was well
known in art circles as a critic and art historian.</p>

<p>"I can tell you exactly what you want to know," said he, "for
I've only just been looking it up, so as to have an article in the
evening papers on it. There was a famous copy of the picture of
Velasquez, said to have been painted by a pupil of his, and for
some years there was quite a controversy among the respective
owners as to which was the genuine one&mdash;just as there is
to-day about a Madonna belonging to a gentleman at St. Moritz, but
which a Vienna gallery also claims to possess.</p>

<p>"However, in the case of 'The Holy Family,' the dispute was
ultimately settled once and for all years ago, and undoubtedly Sir
Gilbert Murrell held the genuine picture. What became of the copy
no one knows. For twenty years all trace of it has been lost.
There&mdash;that's all I can tell you. I shall pad it out a bit in
my article, and I must get to work on it at once. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"One moment&mdash;where was the copy last seen?"</p>

<p>"Oh! the old Earl of Ringmere had it last, but when he knew it
to be a forgery he is said to have sold it for a mere song, all
interest in it being lost, you see."</p>

<p>"Let me see, he's a very old man, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;nearly eighty&mdash;a perfect enthusiast on pictures
still, though."</p>

<p>"Only <i>said</i> to have sold it," muttered Hazell to himself,
as he left the house; "that's very vague&mdash;and there's no
knowing what these enthusiasts will do when they're really bent on
a thing. Sometimes they lose all sense of honesty. I've known
fellows actually rob a friend's collection of stamps or
butterflies. What if there's something in it? By George, what an
awful scandal there would be! It seems to me that if such a scandal
were prevented I'd be thanked all round. Anyhow, I'll have a shot
at it on spec. And I must find out how that truck was run off the
line."</p>

<p>When once Hazell was on the track of a railway mystery he never
let a moment slip by. In an hour's time, he was at the address
given him at Scotland Yard. On his way there he took a card from
his case, a blank one, and wrote on it, "From the Earl of
Ringmere." This he put into an envelope.</p>

<p>"It's a bold stroke," he said to himself, "but, if there's
anything in it, it's worth trying."</p>

<p>So he asked for Allen. The woman who opened the door looked at
him suspiciously, and said she didn't think Mr. Allen was in.</p>

<p>"Give him this envelope," replied Hazell. In a couple of minutes
she returned, and asked him to follow her.</p>

<p>A short, wiry-looking man, with sharp, evil-looking eyes, stood
in the room waiting for him and looking at him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Well," he snapped, "what is it&mdash;what do you want?"</p>

<p>"I come on behalf of the Earl of Ringmere. You will know that
when I mention Churn," replied Hazell, playing his trump card
boldly.</p>

<p>"Well," went on the man, "what about that?"</p>

<p>Hazell wheeled round, locked the door suddenly, put the key in
his pocket, and then faced his man. The latter darted forward, but
Hazell had a revolver pointing at him in a twinkling.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;detective!"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not&mdash;I told you I came on behalf of the
Earl&mdash;that looks like hunting up matters for his sake, doesn't
it?"</p>

<p>"What does the old fool mean?" asked Jeffreys.</p>

<p>"Oh! I see you know all about it. Now listen to me quietly, and
you may come to a little reason. You changed that picture at Churn
the other night."</p>

<p>"You seem to know a lot about it," sneered the other, but less
defiantly.</p>

<p>"Well, I do&mdash;but not quite all. You were foolish to leave
your traces on that lever, eh?"</p>

<p>"How did I do that?" exclaimed the man, giving himself away.</p>

<p>"You'd been dabbling about with oil, you see, and you left your
thumb-print on the handle. I photographed it, and they recognised
it at Scotland Yard. Quite simple."</p>

<p>Jeffreys swore beneath his breath.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd tell me what you mean," he said.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I expect you've been well paid for this little
job."</p>

<p>"If I have, I'm not going to take any risks. I told the old man
so. He's worse than I am&mdash;he put me up to getting the picture.
Let him take his chance when it comes out&mdash;I suppose he wants
to keep his name out of it, that's why you're here."</p>

<p>"You're not quite right. Now just listen to me. You're a
villain, and you deserve to suffer; but I'm acting in a purely
private capacity, and I fancy if I can get the original picture
back to its owner that it will be better for all parties to hush
this affair up. Has the old Earl got it?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet," admitted the other, "he was too artful. But he
knows where it is, and so do I."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;now you're talking sense! Look here! You make a clean
breast of it, and I'll take it down on paper. You shall swear to
the truth of your statement before a commissioner for
oaths&mdash;he need not see the actual confession. I shall hold
this in case it is necessary; but if you help me to get the picture
back to Sir Gilbert, I don't think it will be."</p>

<p>After a little more conversation, Jeffreys explained. Before he
did so, however, Hazell had taken a bottle of milk and a hunch of
wholemeal bread from his pocket, and calmly proceeded to perform
"exercises" and then to eat his "lunch," while Jeffreys told the
following story:</p>

<p>"It was the old Earl who did it. How he got hold of me doesn't
matter&mdash;perhaps I got hold of him&mdash;maybe I put him up to
it&mdash;but that's not the question. He'd kept that forged picture
of his in a lumber room for years, but he always had his eye on the
genuine one. He paid a long price for the forgery, and he got to
think that he ought to have the original. But there, he's mad on
pictures.</p>

<p>"Well, as I say, he kept the forgery out of sight and let folks
think he'd sold it, but all the time he was in hopes of getting it
changed somehow for the original.</p>

<p>"Then I came along and undertook the job for him. There were
three of us in it, for it was a ticklish business. We found out by
what train the picture was to travel&mdash;that was easy enough. I
got hold of a key to unlock that ground frame, and the screwing off
of the bolt was a mere nothing. I oiled the points well, so that
the thing should work as I wanted it to.</p>

<p>"One pal was with me&mdash;in the siding, ready to clap on the
side brake when the truck was running in. I was to work the points,
and my other pal, who had the most awkward job of all, was on the
goods train&mdash;under a tarpaulin in a truck. He had two lengths
of very stout rope with a hook at each end of them.</p>

<p>"When the train left Upton, he started his job. Goods trains
travel very slowly, and there was plenty of time. Counting from the
back brake van, the truck we wanted to run off was No. 5. First he
hooked No. 4 truck to No. 6&mdash;fixing the hook at the side of
the end of both trucks, and having the slack in his hand, coiled
up.</p>

<p>"Then when the train ran down a bit of a decline he uncoupled
No. 5 from No. 4&mdash;standing on No. 5 to do it. That was easy
enough, for he'd taken a coupling staff with him; then he paid out
the slack till it was tight. Next he hooked his second rope from
No. 5 to No. 6, uncoupled No. 5 from No. 6, and paid out the slack
of the second rope.</p>

<p>"Now you can see what happened. The last few trucks of the train
were being drawn by a long rope reaching from No. 4 to No. 6, and
leaving a space in between. In the middle of this space No. 5 ran,
drawn by a short rope from No. 6. My pal stood on No. 6, with a
sharp knife in his hand.</p>

<p>"The rest was easy. I held the lever, close by the side of the
line&mdash;coming forward to it as soon as the engine passed. The
instant the space appeared after No. 6 I pulled it over, and No. 5
took the siding points, while my pal cut the rope at the same
moment.</p>

<p>"Directly the truck had run by and off I reversed the lever so
that the rest of the train following took the main line. There is a
decline before Compton, and the last four trucks came running down
to the main body of the train, while my pal hauled in the slack and
finally coupled No. 4 to No. 6 when they came together. He jumped
from the train as it ran very slowly into Compton. That's how it
was done."</p>

<p>Hazell's eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"It's the cleverest thing I've heard of on the line," he
said.</p>

<p>"Think so? Well, it wanted some handling. The next thing was to
unscrew the packing-case, take the picture out of the frame, and
put the forgery we'd brought with us in its place. That took us
some time, but there was no fear of interruption in that lonely
part. Then I took the picture off, rolling it up first, and hid it.
The old Earl insisted on this. I was to tell him where it was, and
he was going to wait for a few weeks and then get it himself."</p>

<p>"Where did you hide it?"</p>

<p>"You're sure you're going to hush this up?"</p>

<p>"You'd have been in charge long ago if I were not."</p>

<p>"Well, there's a path from Churn to East Ilsley across the
downs, and on the right-hand of that path is an old sheep
well&mdash;quite dry. It's down there. You can easily find the
string if you look for it&mdash;fixed near the top."</p>

<p>Hazell took down the man's confession, which was duly attested.
His conscience told him that perhaps he ought to have taken
stronger measures.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>"I told you I was merely a private individual," said Hazell to
Sir Gilbert Murrell. "I have acted in a purely private capacity in
bringing you your picture."</p>

<p>Sir Gilbert looked from the canvas to the calm face of
Hazell.</p>

<p>"Who are you, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I rather aspire to be a book-collector; you may have read
my little monogram on 'Jacobean Bindings?"'</p>

<p>"No," said Sir Gilbert, "I have not had that pleasure. But I
must inquire further into this. How did you get this picture? Where
was it&mdash;who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir Gilbert," broke in Hazell, "I could tell you the whole
truth, of course. I am not in any way to blame myself. By chance,
as much as anything else, I discovered how your picture had been
stolen, and where it was."</p>

<p>"But I want to know all about it. I shall
prosecute&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think not. Now, do you remember where the forged picture was
seen last?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the Earl of Ringmere had it&mdash;he sold it."</p>

<p>"Did he?"</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"What if he kept it all this time?" said Hazell, with a peculiar
look.</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed Sir Gilbert at length. "You don't mean
<i>that</i>. Why, he has one foot in the grave&mdash;a very old
man&mdash;I was dining with him only a fortnight ago."</p>

<p>"Ah! Well, I think you are content now, Sir Gilbert?"</p>

<p>"It is terrible&mdash;terrible! I have the picture back, but I
wouldn't have the scandal known for worlds."</p>

<p>"It never need be," replied Hazell. "You will make it all right
with the Winchester people?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;even if I have to admit I was mistaken, and
let the forgery stay through the exhibition."</p>

<p>"I think that would be the best way," replied Hazell, who never
regretted his action.</p>

<p>"Of course, Jeffreys ought to have been punished," he said to
himself; "but it was a clever idea&mdash;a clever idea!"</p>

<p>"May I offer you some lunch?" asked Sir Gilbert.</p>

<p>"Thank you; but I am a vegetarian, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think my cook could arrange something&mdash;let me ring."</p>

<p>"It is very good of you, but I ordered a dish of lentils and a
salad at the station restaurant. But if you will allow me just to
go through my physical training ante luncheon exercises here, it
would save me the trouble of a more or less public display at the
station."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the rather bewildered Baronet; whereupon
Hazell threw off his coat and commenced whirling his arms like a
windmill.</p>

<p>"Digestion should be considered <i>before</i> a meal," he
explained.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>HOW THE BANK WAS SAVED</h2>

<p>Thorpe Hazell always looked upon the affair of the Birmingham
Bank from a distinctly humorous point of view, declaring that it
was really not worth calling a railway mystery or adventure, and
that it scarcely called forth any astuteness on his part. And yet
there were facts in the case that are, perhaps, worth
recording.</p>

<p>The banking firm of Crosbie, Penfold, &amp; Co. was an
old-established one in Birmingham, numbering many of the leading
manufacturers among its customers. At the time of this story the
firm suddenly became aware that they had an enemy, and that this
enemy was no other than an exceedingly powerful multi-millionaire
of Germanic Jewish origin, named Peter Kinch. His reputation was
none of the best in the financial world, and it was rumoured that
he would stop at nothing to attain an object.</p>

<p>He had a personal quarrel with the senior partner of the
bank&mdash;old Mr. Crosbie. Kinch's son had met the latter's
daughter abroad, and proposed to her before the girl was old enough
to know her own mind. Her father was furious when he heard about
it, for the young man bore about the same reputation as his father;
and although there were hundreds who looked upon him as a "good
catch," old Crosbie came of a Puritan family, and retained its
instincts strongly.</p>

<p>Samuel Kinch, who was only unbusinesslike when matters concerned
his son, whom he foolishly idolised, went to see Mr. Crosbie on the
matter, and, it is said, offered to settle half-a-million on his
daughter if the old gentleman would consent to the marriage. This
only made him more angry than ever, and he retorted that the girl
was not to be sold.</p>

<p>A couple of years had passed since then, and Phyllis Crosbie had
forgotten her girlish love, and was engaged to Charlie Penfold, the
son of the junior partner&mdash;the "Co.," in reality of the firm.
But Samuel Kinch had <i>not</i> forgotten. Deep down in that keen,
financial brain of his was a strong instinct of revenge for
injuries, and he had taken the affair as a personal slight.</p>

<p>However, outwardly he seemed to have made it up. He was
occasionally in Birmingham on business and in contact with Mr.
Crosbie, and he never referred to the subject. Then, one day, he
deposited the sum of two hundred thousand pounds with the bank.</p>

<p>"I have so much business in Birmingham," he explained, "that it
will be a matter of great convenience if you will hold this
money."</p>

<p>Old Crosbie didn't half like it, and proposed keeping it intact
in their strong room; but the other partners prevailed upon him to
invest it in securities. For some months nothing was heard about
it. Then some strange rumours suddenly got about with regard to the
bank. People began to ask for their cash, and quite a little "run"
was taking place. Suddenly Peter Kinch announced that he wanted his
two hundred thousand pounds immediately.</p>

<p>The partners were met in consultation in their private room at
the bank, which was not yet opened to the public.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Crosbie, "he wants every penny of it to-morrow.
We must face it."</p>

<p>"Under ordinary circumstances we could have paid easily," said
Mr. Penfold senior, "but it's very awkward just now. I can't
understand matters."</p>

<p>"I can," said old Mr. Crosbie; "I believe we're the victims of a
plot, and that Kinch is working it."</p>

<p>"But his object?" asked Charles Penfold.</p>

<p>"Partly private, perhaps&mdash;but there's something else at the
bottom of it, and he could well afford to sacrifice his money here
altogether if he gained his ends."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Charles and his lather simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Railway contracts," replied Mr. Crosbie. "It's a question of
cutting German estimates by Hill &amp; Co. and a couple of other
firms here. If we were to stop payment there would be a serious
lack of ready money, because those three firms do most of their
business with us. If they can't be sure of ready money now, they
daren't undertake the contracts at the price they could otherwise
have done. And in steps the German firm, and the firm in question,
gentlemen, is really Samuel Kinch. It's a smart bit of
business."</p>

<p>He rose from his seat and took a glance out of the window.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said to the others.</p>

<p>It was ten minutes to ten, the hour when the bank opened, and
already five or six people were waiting outside, one of them with a
cheque fluttering in his hand, tapping the pavement impatiently
with his stick. It was obvious that trouble was ahead.</p>

<p>"H'm," exclaimed Mr. Penfold. "I suppose we can hold out
today."</p>

<p>"Yes, for to-day," replied the senior partner grimly. "We have a
fair supply of cash, and I don't think there's any danger. But we
must have some more before we open to-morrow. We had better ask
Simpson to bring us the securities at once. Also we will telegraph
to the Imperial and City, asking them to get the money ready for
us. Then, perhaps you, Mr. Charles, and Simpson could go up by the
11.12 train and bring it down this evening?"</p>

<p>The Imperial and City Bank acted as London agents for Crosbie,
Penfold, &amp; Co., and it would be their office to raise the
necessary funds on the firm's securities. A busy hour was passed in
going over these documents and signing transfers. Meanwhile, a
steady stream of customers kept coming into the bank, and the
cashiers were hard at work paying out money.</p>

<p>Simpson, one of the senior cashiers, who had been selected to
accompany Charles Penfold to London, was a particularly smart and
level-headed fellow.</p>

<p>"I should like to tell you of a rumour I heard last night, sir,"
he said to Mr. Crosbie, when the securities had been looked over
and packed in a strong leather bag.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;what is it?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, we have a powerful enemy, and not over
scrupulous...am I right, sir?"</p>

<p>"Quite right. What of that?"</p>

<p>"It would be to his interest to prevent us from getting this
money in time, sir, and he might not be particular as to what means
he took to do it. One of the juniors was asked a lot of questions
about us last night by a suspicious-looking stranger he
met&mdash;er&mdash;well, in a bar. He didn't let out anything, but
he told me about it, and just now he saw this same man hanging
about the bank."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mr. Penfold. "Of course, Charles," he went on,
"you will take every precaution. You had better telegraph to
Scotland Yard, and ask for a detective to travel back with you this
evening."</p>

<p>"I'll do better than that, father. I'll wire to my friend Thorpe
Hazell. What he doesn't know about railways isn't worth knowing,
and I'll ask him to meet me at the Imperial and City. He'll
probably come back with us, and I'd really rather have him than an
ordinary detective. If there's going to be any attempt at robbery
on the line, his advice will be the best to act upon, I'm
sure."</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Thorpe Hazell found himself in
consultation with Charles Penfold a little after three o'clock that
day in a private room at the Imperial and City Bank, which, as
everyone knows, is situated in Throgmorton Street.</p>

<p>"I'm sure we are being carefully watched," said Penfold. "You
noticed it, didn't you, Simpson?"</p>

<p>"Distinctly, sir. Not only on the train, but I'm certain a taxi
followed us here."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Hazell, "the thing is very obvious. You say you
have reason to believe that an attempt is going to be made to rob
you of this large sum of money. By the way, what does it consist of
and how do you propose to carry it?"</p>

<p>"Mostly of Bank of England notes, but a certain amount of gold.
We shall pack it in this bag. If we all three travel with it, it
ought to be safe."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not so sure of that," said Hazell; "from what you
tell me, we evidently have a very wily enemy to deal with, and my
experience of railway mysteries tells me there is not always safety
in numbers. What train did you think of taking?"</p>

<p>"The 4.55 from Paddington. But if you advised it we might travel
by another route."</p>

<p>"Quite so. But the enemy might have thought of that, too, and
taken steps accordingly. We must be prepared for all emergencies.
Now, suppose you tell me exactly why you think this attempt is
likely to be made. Is there any ulterior motive besides
robbery?"</p>

<p>Penfold explained that there was, telling Hazell the question of
the German contracts. The latter's face brightened during the
recital.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said, "suppose your hypothesis is correct and the
robbery took place, what would happen?"</p>

<p>"Well, Kinch would know at once, I expect, and would wire to
Germany without delay, anticipating the fact that we should have to
stop payment tomorrow. He has everything ready, we know."</p>

<p>"Ah, and suppose he wired and put the machinery in motion, and
after all you <i>could</i> pay to-morrow, what about that?"</p>

<p>"He wouldn't be such a fool. Why, it would cost him a million.
Sure to. Perhaps more. When a man like Kinch once makes a slip it's
pretty bad for his reputation."</p>

<p>Hazell got up from his chair and slapped Penfold on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Excellent, my dear chap," he exclaimed; "I thought at first you
were only bringing me an ordinary case of prevention of robbery in
a train. But this is really likely to be interesting. Quite a
little comedy, in fact. That is, if you will place yourself in my
hands entirely?"</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Penfold, "but I don't quite see your
meaning."</p>

<p>"Ah, you're rather tired and run down, you see. This affair is
making you over anxious. Let me recommend a few hours at the
seaside. Bournemouth, now, is a capital place. And, by the way, Mr.
Simpson," he went on, addressing the cashier, "it's close on
half-past three. Not too soon in the afternoon for a cup of tea.
There's an A. B. C. fifty yards from the bank. Go and get some tea,
my dear sir, and come back in a quarter of an hour's time; and
would you mind bringing me a pint of milk in a bottle and a packet
of plasmon chocolate? I shall have to dine <i>en route</i>."</p>

<p>Penfold stared at him in amazement, but Hazell insisted. As soon
as he was out of the room Hazell exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Quick now&mdash;see the directors here and get the cash; it
ought to be ready now. Have it as much in notes as possible. We
must pack that bag before Simpson returns. I'm afraid I'm going to
impose on him a little. Ah, and I shall want another bag&mdash;mine
will do. I brought it with me in case I was out for the night; and
we'll ask the people here to lend us some weights, or anything
heavy will do."</p>

<p>He emptied the things out of his bag, two of the directors came
in with the money a few minutes afterwards, and then Penfold began
to see daylight. Meanwhile Hazell was rapidly turning over the
leaves of a Bradshaw and jotting down notes on a bit of paper,
which he presently handed to Penfold.</p>

<p>"Follow these directions carefully. It's best for you to keep
out of the way. Now then, here comes Simpson. Not a word,
gentlemen, please!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Simpson," he went on, as the cashier came in, "Mr.
Penfold agrees with me that you had better take the money down with
me. He's not feeling very well, and he's going for a little
holiday. You will have to explain matters to his partners. You and
I will start directly, but I'm going to see Mr. Penfold off first.
Come along, old fellow, you'll catch the 4.10 to Bournemouth
easily."</p>

<p>He took him outside the bank, holding his bag in his hand,
hailed a hansom, and, as Penfold got in, said to him in a loud tone
of voice:</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, old chap. I'll see this thing through. It's
much better for you to keep out of it, because Simpson and I can
manage it. I hope you'll find your sister better when you get to
Bournemouth; it may not be so bad as the telegram makes out."</p>

<p>He noticed, to his intense delight, that a man who was lounging
past dropped his stick on the pavement close by, and stopped to
pick it up.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Penfold&mdash;oh, I was nearly forgetting your bag;
here you are. Now then, my man," he added, addressing the
chauffeur, "Waterloo Station, sharp!"</p>

<p>He had the satisfaction of seeing the man who had dropped the
stick hail another hansom, which followed in the wake of
Penfold's.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "they'll see he takes a ticket for Bournemouth,
and they won't suspect anything. Now for a little adventure!"</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later he was seated in a taxi-cab with
Simpson, <i>en route</i> for Paddington. The leather bag, heavy
with the weight of its contents, lay on the floor in front of them.
Once or twice Hazell put his head out of the window and looked
behind, laughing softly to himself when he drew it back.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Simpson," he said to his companion, presently, "you
and I are about to run the gauntlet. Perhaps you may think my
conduct a little strange, later, but I must beg of you not to
question it."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Simpson, who had hardly taken his eyes off
the precious bag in front of him, "I have every confidence in you,
Mr. Hazell."</p>

<p>"That's right. Now, suppose&mdash;mind, I only say
<i>suppose</i>&mdash;you and I are attacked on the train to-night,
you would defend that bag of money, eh?"</p>

<p>Simpson turned to him in surprise.</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;" he began, but a smile on the other's face
stopped him.</p>

<p>"It is a considerable sum, I know," he said, "but not so
valuable as a human life&mdash;<i>if</i> you were threatened, Mr.
Simpson, eh?"</p>

<p>Again the smile crept over his face, and puzzled the cashier for
a moment.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> should prefer to save my life, I think," went on
Hazell. "Let us look at the matter seriously. You are attacked,
we'll say, and the odds are too great. The villains get away with
the money. Perhaps you are able to stop the train. But the money
has disappeared. You would go to Mr. Crosbie when you reached
Birmingham, and tell him of this terrible misfortune. You would
tell the Police. This fellow, Kinch, if he's at the bottom of it,
would, put his little plan in action at once. Dear me! A most
`regrettable incident,' as politicians call it. You would throw the
whole blame on me. And then&mdash;and then&mdash;let us suppose
that after all the money was at the bank the next morning. What a
surprise! Villainy defeated&mdash;virtue triumphant. No! Don't ask
me any questions. Here we are at Paddington."</p>

<p>A broad grin broke out on Simpson's face as he got out.</p>

<p>"Be careful of the precious bag," said Hazell. "That's
right."</p>

<p>The short winter's day was drawing to a close, and darkness had
begun to set in. Hazell looked, suspiciously, all round him, and
kept close to Simpson, helping him to carry the heavy bag. They
took first-class tickets for Birmingham, and tipped the guard to
secure them a compartment. On Hazell giving Simpson directions, the
latter got in with the bag, and Hazell stood outside on the
platform as if on guard.</p>

<p>Presently an old clergyman came along with shuffling step. He
was about to get into the same compartment, when Hazell stopped
him, telling him it was engaged. He bowed politely, and got into
the next one. The carriage was well up the platform and in front of
the train, and the majority of the passengers were getting in
behind, as is often the case at terminal stations.</p>

<p>A few minutes before the train started a couple of
men&mdash;strong-looking fellows&mdash;came marching up the
platform and got into the compartment immediately in front of
Simpson. They were dressed rather like farmers, and one of them
carried a heavy stick.</p>

<p>The positions of the travellers in this particular carriage were
now as follows:</p>

<blockquote>1st compartment&mdash;the two men.<br>
2nd compartment&mdash;Simpson.<br>
3rd compartment&mdash;the old clergyman.</blockquote>

<p>Hazell still stood outside the door on the platform. The hand of
the great clock was almost on the moment of departure when he
suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I've forgotten to get a paper. There's just time."</p>

<p>He ran back to the bookstall. At the same moment the old
clergyman put his head out of the window and watched him. He bought
his paper and started back.</p>

<p>At that exact moment the guard waved his green lamp, the whistle
sounded, and the train began very slowly to move.</p>

<p>"Look sharp, sir!"</p>

<p>Then Hazell did a very clumsy thing. He caught his toe in the
platform and fell, sprawling.</p>

<p>The next moment he was on his feet, but it was too late to catch
his compartment. He made a rush for the next carriage; his keen
eyes detected an empty compartment; he opened the door and swung
himself into the moving train. Simpson, who had his head out of the
window, saw what had happened. At first he felt strangely
disconcerted, and then, once more, he broke into a smile.</p>

<p>The first stop was at Oxford. Hazell lit a cigar and threw
himself back in his seat, laughing softly to himself.</p>

<p>"They are really a very clumsy lot," he soliloquised, "my
reputation is quite at stake in allowing it. Never mind,
though."</p>

<p>From time to time he looked out of the window towards the front
of the train, but it was not until they had travelled a
considerable distance beyond Reading that the comedy he was
expecting began to be played.</p>

<p>Then he saw, in the darkness, the door of the compartment in
front of Simpson's open, and a figure on the footboard. Darting to
the other side and looking out of that window he could just discern
someone on that side of the carriage also.</p>

<p>Simpson was sitting in his compartment, wondering what was going
to happen. Suddenly there was an awful crashing of glass, and the
window on the left-hand side was splintered to bits by a violent
blow from a stick from outside. Involuntarily Simpson first started
back, and then sprang at the window.</p>

<p>The ruse succeeded admirably, for at the same moment the
opposite door was opened and a man sprang in. Before Simpson knew
what had happened, he felt himself seized by the collar from behind
and dragged back. Then the door with the splintered window opened,
and the second villain threw himself upon him. Resistance was out
of the question. In three minutes Simpson lay on the seat, his
hands and feet tied, and a handkerchief bound over his mouth.</p>

<p>"There," said one of the men, "that little job's done. It's
lucky for you my friend, that that clumsy detective isn't in with
you, or we might have had to use <i>this</i>," and he showed a
revolver. "But we shan't hurt you. We're just going to search you
to see if you have any notes on you, in case they're not all in the
bag."</p>

<p>They set to work, coolly enough, but found nothing.</p>

<p>"Well," went on the man, "now we'll clear out. Sorry to have
troubled you," he added, to the cashier, "but you should have taken
more care of your property. By George, it's precious heavy!"</p>

<p>"Ready?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;where are we?"</p>

<p>"Between Cholsey and Didcot."</p>

<p>"Right!"</p>

<p>He gave a sharp tug at the chain of the communication-cord with
which every Great Western express is provided inside the carriages.
A moment or two later there was a shrieking of the engine whistle
and a grinding of the brakes.</p>

<p>As the train slowed down the two men, taking the heavy bag with
them, prepared to get out. The one who held the bag was actually on
the footboard before the train stopped, and Hazell, who was
watching from his window, distinctly saw what happened.</p>

<p>The train came to a standstill on an embankment, and the two
robbers jumped and ran for all they were worth, but not before more
than one of the passengers had caught a glimpse of them. The guard
came running along the train, together with Hazell.</p>

<p>The latter made for Simpson's compartment, and was taken a
little aback when he found him lying prostrate, but a couple of
seconds sufficed to show he was unhurt. He tore the gag off, and
the two of them raised a hue-and-cry that was heard all along the
train.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the guard.</p>

<p>"Robbery!" shouted Simpson, as they cut his bonds, "thousands of
pounds, man."</p>

<p>"Money for a Birmingham bank," explained Hazell. "I was in
charge of it with the cashier here, only I nearly got left behind
at Paddington and travelled in another compartment. Quick! They
mustn't escape!"</p>

<p>"What was the money in?" asked the guard, who thought the men a
couple of fools to travel with it as they had done.</p>

<p>"A leather bag&mdash;they must have taken it off&mdash;there
were two of them."</p>

<p>"I saw them running down the embankment," exclaimed a passenger
who had joined them, "but I'll swear they were carrying nothing.
They vaulted over the fence at the bottom, and each of them used
both his hands."</p>

<p>Hazell was standing beside the train and a frown swept over his
face. He glanced up quickly at the elderly clergyman, who was
looking out of the window.</p>

<p>"Did you see them, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Could you make out if they carried a bag?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;I'm sure they did."</p>

<p>"And I'll swear they didn't," said the dogged passenger.</p>

<p>"We'll search the train&mdash;sharp, please," said the guard,
and he mounted into the old clergyman's compartment at once. But
there was nothing there. Nor could anything be discovered in or
near the train.</p>

<p>"Now," said the guard, "I'm very sorry gentlemen, but I can't
delay the train longer. You should have carried the money in my
van. All I can do is to stop at Didcot to let you get out and send
a telegram or see the police. That's your affair. It's evident
they've made off. Take your seats, please!"</p>

<p>One or two passengers who had started on a chase on the spur of
the moment came panting back. Hazell nudged Simpson, and they
climbed up into the compartment occupied by the clergyman.</p>

<p>"This is not your carriage," he said mildly, as the train
started.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;so I see," said Hazell. "Never mind. This is a
terrible thing&mdash;terrible!" and he went on to discuss the
robbery.</p>

<p>"You had better wire from Didcot to Mr. Crosbie," he said to
Simpson, "see the police there, and then come on to Birmingham by a
later train."</p>

<p>"What shall you do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I think I'll go on. Of course you'll also wire back to
London to have the notes stopped. That's all we can do, I
think."</p>

<p>An almost imperceptible smile passed over the face of the old
clergyman.</p>

<p>"Was it all in notes, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. There was a considerable sum in gold," replied Hazell,
who, even for an amateur detective, was strangely
communicative.</p>

<p>At Oxford the old clergyman got out for a moment. Hazell saw him
hand a paper to an official, and the latter made for the telegraph
office. When he came back to the carriage he got into another
compartment. Hazell followed him, a sweet smile on his face. The
old clergyman grew very grumpy and uneasy.</p>

<p>But Hazell stuck to him like a leech&mdash;not only to
Birmingham, but all the way to Chester. The old gentleman became
more and more uneasy as the train went on. He even told Hazell that
he wished to be alone. But Hazell only smiled, and offered excuses.
Then he introduced the subject of physical culture, explaining the
desirability of lentil and plasmon diet, and giving practical
explanation of "nerve training" by holding a piece of paper in
front of his face at arm's length and keeping the edge in line with
the hat-rack opposite. When they got to Chester he stood about on
the platform till the empty train was backed off into a siding.</p>

<p>Then the old gentleman, who had been hovering about the train
also, lost his temper, and swore under his breath.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Old Mr. Crosbie and Mr. Penfold, senior, sat in their private
room in the bank, with Simpson standing before them. The latter was
having a very bad time of it indeed. Questions and rebukes were
being hurled at his devoted head by the two partners.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand it at all, can you, Penfold?"</p>

<p>"No," said the latter, "and I'm bound to say I think you have
acted in a very strange manner, Simpson. You may go to your
place&mdash;but there is a detective in the bank, and he has orders
to see that you don't leave."</p>

<p>All the papers were full of the robbery that morning. A little
crowd had gathered outside the bank waiting for the doors to open.
Several Birmingham firms were in consternation. The partners, who
had been up all night, looked at each other blankly.</p>

<p>"Can we open?" asked Mr. Crosbie in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>"We daren't," he groaned.</p>

<p>A few minutes passed in silence. The clock in the office marked
seven minutes to the hour. A cab dashed up outside.</p>

<p>The next moment Charles Penfold, fresh and smiling, stood before
the partners, opening a bag, and turning out his pockets before
their astounded gaze. There was no time for explanation.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the doors of the bank opened, and the
foremost of the crowd outside entered, wondering what was about to
happen. By common consent they gave way to a coarse-looking man who
was forcing his way to the paying-out counter, a smile of triumph
on his evil features. For they recognised him as the Nemesis of the
bank, Samuel Kinch himself, who had come to take his revenge in
person.</p>

<p>He slammed down a cheque upon the counter. The cashier turned it
over carelessly to see the indorsement. He did not even ask him to
step into the partners' room. He had his instructions.</p>

<p>"You will take it in notes, I suppose, sir?" he asked
coolly.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you've got enough," replied Kinch insolently.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, sir."</p>

<p>There was a dead silence, broken only by the rustle and
crackling of roll after roll of Bank of England notes as the
cashier counted them out and Kinch checked them, with a snarling
expression on his face.</p>

<p>Then arose a hum and a buzz. Kinch had been paid. For
half-an-hour the paying cashiers were fairly busy, but the tide was
beginning to turn, and in an hour's time the receiving cashiers
were doing all the work.</p>

<p>The credit of Crosbie, Penfold &amp; Co. was saved, and the
tenders for the railway contracts could be delivered without fear
of lack of cash for preliminary expenses and raw material.</p>

<p>"One in the eye for old Kinch!" was the verdict of the day.</p>

<p>"Oh, the thing was childish!" said Hazell that evening at the
snug little dinner to which old Mr. Crosbie had invited him, but at
which he only ate his "plasmon," and partook of seven raw
apples&mdash;the other partner, Charles Penfold, and Simpson were
also present&mdash;"I saw that if there was a sham robbery this
cunning Samuel Kinch would heap vengeance on himself. So I sent Mr.
Charles Penfold here down to Bournemouth, his pockets stuffed with
notes, and my own bag stuffed with gold, and slung on the roof of a
hansom to avoid suspicion. It would be difficult for them to
connect Bournemouth with Birmingham, but we managed to do so by a
devious route.</p>

<p>"Then I filled the leather bag with weights and things. Simpson,
<i>of course</i>, thought we had the money, ha! ha! ha! Oh,
<i>don't</i> say you didn't, Simpson&mdash;don't spoil it. It was a
clumsy method of attack, but it answered."</p>

<p>"But what became of that bag?"</p>

<p>"That's just the greatest joke of the whole thing. I was looking
out of the window, Simpson, as the beggars got off, and I saw them
hand the bag to that sweet old clergyman. The train had hardly
stopped before he was out of it. He climbed to the roof of the
carriage by the steps at the end, put the bag on the top, and was
in at the other side of his compartment in a jiffy. I travelled all
the way to Chester to prevent him from laying his hands on that
bag, and he was furious. It may be going about the country in that
fashion still, for all we know."</p>

<p>"But why prevent him when it was of no value?" asked Mr.
Crosbie.</p>

<p>"That was just it. If he had once discovered it was only a sham
robbery he would have given the alarm to Kinch&mdash;and that would
have spoilt all."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Hazell. I'm sure the Bank is deeply indebted to
you."</p>

<p>"Not at all. It has been a very ludicrous little adventure, and
I've thoroughly enjoyed it."</p>

<p>Here he suddenly jumped from his seat, threw himself on his back
on the floor, stretching his arms over his head as far as they
could reach.</p>

<p>"Good gracious," exclaimed old Mr. Crosbie, "what's the matter?
Are you ill?"</p>

<p>"I should be," replied Hazell gravely, "very probably, if I did
not take fifty deep breaths in a recumbent position. It is the
secret of digesting fruit!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>THE AFFAIR OF THE GERMAN
DISPATCH-BOX</h2>

<p>Thorpe Hazell often said afterwards that the most daring case
which he ever undertook was that of the German Dispatch-Box. It was
an affair of international importance at the time, and, for obvious
reasons, remained shrouded in mystery. Now, however, when it may be
relegated to the region of obsolete diplomatic crises, there is no
reason why it should not, to a certain extent, be made public.</p>

<p>Hazell was only half through his breakfast one morning at his
house in Netherton, when a telegram arrived for him with this
message:</p>

<blockquote>Am coming by next train. Wish to consult you on
important question.<br>
<br>
Mostyn Cotterell.</blockquote>

<p>"Cotterell, Cotterell," said Hazell to himself. "Oh, yes, I
remember&mdash;he was on the same staircase with myself at St.
Philip's. A reading man in those days. I haven't seen him for
years. Surely he's something in the Government now. Let me
see."</p>

<p>He got his Whitaker and consulted its pages. Presently he found
what he wanted.</p>

<p>"Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs&mdash;Mostyn
Cotterell."</p>

<p>As soon as he had finished his breakfast, including his pint of
lemonade, he produced a "Book of Exercises," and carefully went
through the following directions:</p>

<p>"Stand in correct position, commence to inhale, and at the same
time commence to tense the muscles of the arms, and raise them to
an extended front horizontal position; leave the hands to drop limp
from the wrists. While doing this change the weight of the body
from the full foot on to the toes; in this position hold the breath
and make rigid and extended the muscles of the arms, sides, neck,
abdomen, and legs. Repeat this fifteen times."</p>

<p>Half-an-hour or so later Mostyn Cotterell was ushered into his
room. He was a tall, thin man, with a black moustache that made his
naturally pale face look almost white. There was a haggard look
about him, and certain dark lines under his eyes showed pretty
plainly that he was suffering from want of sleep.</p>

<p>"It's a good many years since we met, Hazell," he began, "and
you have gained quite a reputation since the old college days."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see you have read my monograph on `Nerve Culture and
Rational Food,&mdash;replied Hazell.</p>

<p>"Never heard of it," said Cotterell. "No, I mean your reputation
as a railway expert, my dear fellow."</p>

<p>"Oh, railways!" exclaimed Hazell in a disappointed tone of
voice. "They're just a hobby of mine, that's all. Is that why
you've come?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. I called at your flat in town, but was told you were
here. I want to consult you on a delicate matter, Hazell; one in
which your knowledge of railways may prove of great value. Of
course, it is understood that what I am going to say is quite
private."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Well, let me put a case. Suppose a man was travelling, say,
from London to the Continent by the ordinary boat train; and
suppose that it was desirable to prevent that man from getting to
his destination, would it&mdash;well&mdash;would it be possible to
prevent him doing so?"</p>

<p>Hazell smiled.</p>

<p>"Your enigma is a difficult one to answer," he said. "It would
all depend upon the means you cared to employ. I daresay it could
be done, but you would probably have to resort to force."</p>

<p>"That would hardly be politic. I want you to suggest some plan
by which he could be got into a wrong train, or got out of the
right one, so that, let us say, something he was carrying would be
lost, or, at least, delayed in transit."</p>

<p>"You are not very clear, Cotterell. First you speak of the man
being frustrated, and then of something he is carrying. What do you
mean? Which is of the greater importance&mdash;the man or his
property?"</p>

<p>"His property."</p>

<p>"That puts a different aspect on it. I take it this is some
intrigue of your profession. Why not place confidence in me, and
tell me the whole thing? I never like to work on supposition. Once
some fellows tried to draw me on a supposed case of wrecking a
train. I could have told them half-a-dozen theories of my own
invention, but I held my tongue, and lucky it was that I did so,
for I found out afterwards they belonged to an American train
robber gang. I don't accuse you of any nefarious purposes, but if
you want my advice, tell me the exact circumstances. Only, I warn
you beforehand, Cotterell, that I won't give you any tips that
would either compromise me or be of danger to any railway
company."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the Under-Secretary, "I will tell you the
leading facts without betraying any State secrets, except to
mention that there is a great stake involved. To cut matters short,
a very important document has been stolen from our office. We
pretty well know the culprit, only we have no proof. But we are
certain of one thing and that is that this document is at present
in the hands of the German Ambassador. You will understand that the
ways of diplomacy are very subtle and that it is a case which makes
action very difficult. If we were to demand the surrender of this
paper we should be met, I have no doubt, with a bland denial that
it is in the Ambassador's possession.</p>

<p>"Of course we have our secret agents, and they have told us that
Colonel Von Kriegen, one of the messengers of the German Embassy,
has been ordered to start at mid-day with dispatches to Berlin. It
is more than likely&mdash;in fact it is a dead certainty&mdash;that
this particular document will be included in his dispatches. Now,
if it once gets into the possession of the German Chancellery,
there will be a bad international trouble which might even land us
in a Continental war. If you can devise any means of obstructing or
preventing the transit of this dispatch you would be rendering the
country a real service."</p>

<p>Hazell thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"Do you think this Colonel Von Kriegen knows of the document he
is carrying?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think so, its contents are of far too much
importance to trust even to a regular messenger. No, he will
probably be told to exercise the greatest care, and his journey
will be watched and himself guarded by the German secret
police."</p>

<p>"How is he likely to carry the document?"</p>

<p>"In his dispatch-box, together with other papers."</p>

<p>"And he will probably travel with secret police. My dear fellow,
you have given me a hard nut to crack. Let me think a bit."</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette and smoked hard for a few minutes. Presently
he asked Cotterell if the dispatch-box had a handle to it.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;of course," replied the Under-Secretary; "a leather
handle."</p>

<p>"I wish I knew exactly what it was like."</p>

<p>"I can easily tell you. All the dispatch-boxes of the German
Embassy are of the same pattern. It is our business to know the
smallest details. It would be about a foot long, eight inches
broad, and about five inches deep, with a handle on the top&mdash;a
dark green box."</p>

<p>Hazell's face lit up with sudden interest.</p>

<p>"You haven't one exactly like it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, we have. At my office."</p>

<p>"Will the key be with the Colonel?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. The Ambassador here will lock it, and it will
not be opened till it is in the hands of the Chancellor in
Berlin."</p>

<p>Hazell jumped to his feet and began to stride up and down the
room.</p>

<p>"Cotterell!" he exclaimed, "there's just one plan that occurs to
me. It's a very desperate one, and even if it succeeds it will land
me in prison.</p>

<p>"In England?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"Rather. I'm not going to play any tricks on the Continent, I
can tell you. Now, suppose I'm able to carry out this plan and am
imprisoned&mdash;say at Dovehaven&mdash;what would happen?"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly in his walk and looked at Cotterell. A grin
broke over the latter's face, and he said, quietly:</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;you'd escape, Hazell."</p>

<p>"Very good. I shall want help. <i>You'd</i> better not come.
Have you got a knowing fellow whom you can trust? He must be a
sharp chap, mind."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have. One of our private men, named Bartlett."</p>

<p>"Good. There are just two hours before the Continental train
starts, and a quarter of an hour before you get a train back to
town. You wire Bartlett from Netherton to meet you, and I'll write
out instructions for you to give him. He'll have an hour in which
to carry them out."</p>

<p>He wrote rapidly for five minutes upon a sheet of paper, and
then handed it over to the Under-Secretary.</p>

<p>"Mind you," he said, "the chances are terribly against us, and I
can only promise to do my best. I shall follow you to town by
another train that will give me just time to catch the boat
express. What is this Von Kriegen like?"</p>

<p>Cotterell described him.</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;now you must be off!"</p>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour later Hazell came out of his house,
somewhat changed in appearance. He had put on the same dark wig
which he wore in the affair of Crane's cigars, and was dressed in a
black serge suit and straw hat. A clerical collar completed the
deception of a clergyman in semi-mufti.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>A stiffly-upright, military-looking man, with the ends of his
fair moustache strongly waxed, dressed in a frock coat suit and
tall hat, and carrying a dispatch-box, walked down the platform
beside the boat train, the guard, who knew him well by
sight&mdash;as he knew many who travelled on that line with their
precious dispatches&mdash;giving him a salute as he passed.</p>

<p>Two men walked closely, but unobtrusively behind the Colonel;
two men whose eyes and ears were on the alert, and who scrutinised
everyone carefully as they passed along. Of their presence the
Special Messenger took not the slightest notice, though he was well
aware of their companionship. He selected a first-class
compartment, and got in. The two men followed him into the
carriage, but without saying a word. One of them posted himself by
the window, and kept a steady look out on to the platform.</p>

<p>The train was just about to start, and the guard had just put
his whistle to his mouth, when a man came running down the
platform, a small bag in one hand, a bundle of papers and an
umbrella in the other. It was only a clergyman, and the man at the
window gave a smile as he saw him.</p>

<p>With a rush, the clergyman made for the compartment, seizing the
handle of the door and opening it. Frantically he threw his bag,
umbrella, and papers into the carriage. The train had just begun to
move.</p>

<p>The man near the window had retreated at the onslaught. He was
just about to resent the intrusion with the words that the
compartment was engaged, when a porter, running up behind the
clergyman, pushed him in and slammed the door.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd lost it!" exclaimed the intruder, taking off his
hat and wiping the perspiration from his forehead, for it was a
very hot day, and he had been hurrying. "It was a close shave! Oh,
thank you, thank you!" he added, as one of the men rather
ungraciously picked up his bag and papers from the floor, at the
same time eyeing him closely.</p>

<p>But Hazell, in his disguise, was perfectly proof against any
suspicion. He sat down and opened the <i>Guardian</i> with an easy
air, just looking round at each of his three companions in such a
naturally inquisitive manner as to thoroughly disarm them from the
outset. The Colonel had lighted a cigar and said, half
apologetically, as he took it from his lips:</p>

<p>"I hope you don't mind smoking?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all. I do it myself occasionally," returned the
clergyman with an amiable smile.</p>

<p>The train was now fairly under way, and Hazell was beginning, as
he read his paper, to take mental stock of his surroundings and the
positions in which the other three were seated.</p>

<p>He, himself, was facing the engine on the left-hand side of the
compartment, close to the window. Immediately opposite to him sat
Colonel von Kriegen, watchful and alert, although he seemed to
smoke so complacently. Beside the Colonel, on the seat on his left,
was the precious dispatch-box; and the Colonel's hand, as it
dangled negligently over the arm-rest, touched it ever and anon. On
the next seat, guarding the dispatch-box on that side, sat one of
the secret police agents, while the other had placed himself next
to Hazell and, consequently, opposite the box, which was thus
thoroughly guarded at all points.</p>

<p>It was this dispatch-box that Hazell was studying as he
apparently read his paper, noting its exact position and distance
from him. As he had told Morton Cotterell, the chances of carrying
out his plan were very much against him, and he felt that this was
more than ever the case now. He had really hoped to secure a seat
beside the box. But this was out of the question.</p>

<p>After a bit he put down his paper, leant forward, and looked out
of the window, watching the country as they sped through it. Once,
just as they were passing through a station, he stood up and leant
his head out of the window for a minute. The three men exchanged
glances now that his back was turned, but the Colonel only smiled
and shook his head slightly.</p>

<p>Then Hazell sat down once more, yawned, gathered up his paper,
and made another apparent attempt to read it. After a bit, he drew
a cigarette case from his pocket, took out a cigarette, and placed
it in his mouth. Then he leant forward, in a very natural attitude,
and began feeling in his waistcoat pocket for a match.</p>

<p>The German Colonel watched him, carelessly flicking the ash from
his cigar as he did so. Then, as it was apparent that the clergyman
could find no matches, his politeness came to the front.</p>

<p>"You want a light, sir," he said in very good English, "can I
offer you one?"</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks!" replied Hazell, shifting to the edge of his seat,
and leaning still more forward, "perhaps I may take one from your
cigar?"</p>

<p>Every action that followed had been most carefully thought out
beforehand. As he leant over towards the German he turned his back
slightly on the man who sat beside him. He held the cigarette with
the first and second fingers of his right hand and with the end of
it in his mouth. He kept his eyes fixed on the Colonel's. Meanwhile
his left hand went out through the open window, dropped over the
sill, remained there a moment, then came back, and crossed over the
front of his body stealthily with the palm downwards.</p>

<p>It was all over in a second, before either of the three had time
to grasp what was happening. He had his face close up to the
Colonel's, and had taken a puff at the cigarette, when suddenly his
left hand swooped down on the handle of the dispatch-box, his right
hand flew forward into the Colonel's face, instantly coming round
with a quick sweep to his left hand, and, before the Colonel could
recover or either of the others take action, he had tossed the
dispatch-box out of the window.</p>

<p>They were on him at once. He sprang up, back to the window, and
made a little struggle, but the Colonel and one of the others had
him on the seat in no time. Meanwhile the third man had pulled the
electric safety signal, and had dashed to the window. Thrusting his
head out, he looked back along the level bit of line on which they
were running.</p>

<p>"I can see it!" he cried triumphantly, as his eye caught a dark
object beside the track. The whole affair had taken place so
suddenly that the train began to pull up within fifteen or twenty
seconds of the throwing out of the dispatch case. There was a
shrill whistle, a grinding of brakes, and the train came to a
standstill.</p>

<p>The guard was out of his van in an instant, running along beside
the train.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked, as he came up to the carriage.</p>

<p>The police agent, who still kept his eyes fixed back on the
track, beckoned him to come up. Heads were out of windows, and this
matter was a private one. So the guard climbed on to the
footboard.</p>

<p>"A dispatch-box has been thrown out of the carriage," whispered
the police agent; "we have the man here. But we must get the case.
It's only a little way back. We pulled the signal at once&mdash;in
fact, I could see it lying beside the track before we stopped."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," replied the guard quietly, commencing to wave
an arm towards the rear of the train. The signal was seen on the
engine, and the train began to reverse. Very soon a small, dark
object could be seen alongside the rails. As they drew close, the
guard held out his hand motionless, the train stopped, and he
jumped off.</p>

<p>"Is this it?" he asked, as he handed in the dispatch-box.</p>

<p>"Yes!" exclaimed the Colonel, "it's all right. Thank you, guard.
Here's something for your trouble. We'll hand over the fellow to
the police at Dovehaven. It was a clumsy trick."</p>

<p>Colonel Von Kriegen lit another cigar as the train went on, and
looked at Hazell, who sat between the two police agents. There was
a half smile on the Colonel's lips as he said:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you did not quite succeed, sir! It was a sharp thing
to do, but it didn't go quite far enough. You might have been sure
that in broad daylight, and with the means of stopping the train,
that it was impossible. Who put you on to this?"</p>

<p>"I accept the entire responsibility myself," replied
Hazell&mdash;"failure and all. I have only one favour to ask you.
Will you allow me to eat my lunch?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," replied the Colonel grimly&mdash;"especially as
you won't have a chance of doing so when we arrive at Dovehaven. I
should like you to travel all the way with us, but the exigencies
of international law prevent that."</p>

<p>Hazell bowed, and the next moment was placidly consuming Plasmon
biscuits and drinking sterilised milk, expatiating at intervals on
"natural food."</p>

<p>"Try a diet of macaroni and Dutch cheese," were his last words
to the Colonel. "They both help to build up the grey brain
material. Useful in your position!"</p>

<p>When the train arrived at Dovehaven, Hazell was given into the
charge of the police there, and marched off to the station. Here
the superintendent looked at him curiously. Hazell met his gaze,
but nothing was said. It was strange, however, that he was not
locked up in an ordinary cell, but in a small room.</p>

<p>It was also strange that the bar of the window was very loose,
and that no one was about when he dropped out of it that night. The
German police, when they heard about it, smiled. Diplomatic affairs
are peculiar, and they knew that this particular "criminal" would
never be caught.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Colonel journeyed on to Berlin, with the full
assurance in his mind that the papers in his dispatch-box were
intact. He duly handed the latter over in person to the Chancellor,
who, as the result of a cypher telegram, was eagerly expecting
it.</p>

<p>Somehow, his key did not fit the lock of the dispatch-box. After
trying it for a few moments, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Colonel, how is this? This is not one of our boxes,
surely?"</p>

<p>The Colonel's face turned pale, and he hesitated to reply.
Snatching up a knife, the Chancellor forced open the box, a cry of
dismay issuing from his lips as he drew out the contents&mdash;the
current number of <i>Punch</i>, in which he figured in a cartoon,
and a copy of the <i>Standard</i>, containing an article, carefully
marked, on the foreign policy of the Government. Insult to injury,
if you like.</p>

<p>German oaths never look well in print, and, anyhow, it is
needless to record the ensuing conversation between the Chancellor
and Colonel Von Kriegen. At about the time it was taking place the
German Ambassador in London received by post the original
dispatch-box and its contents, minus the incriminating document,
which now reposed safely in the custody of the Foreign Office,
thanks to the ingenuity of Thorpe Hazell.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>"How was it done?" said Hazell afterwards, when telling the
story to a companion. "Oh, it was a pure trick, and I hardly
expected to be able to bring it off. Fortunately, Bartlett was a
'cute chap, and followed out all my instructions to the letter.
Those instructions were very simple. I told him to wear an
Inverness cloak, to provide himself with the duplicate
dispatch-box, a few yards of very strong fishing twine, a
fair-sized snap-hook, and a light walking-stick with a forked bit
of wire stuck in the end of it. The only difficulty about his job
was the presence of other travellers in his compartment, but, as it
happened, there were only two maiden ladies, who thought him mad on
fresh air.</p>

<p>"Of course, I told him how to use his various articles, and also
that on no account was he to communicate with me either by word or
look, but that he was to get into the compartment next to that in
which the Colonel was travelling, and to be ready to command either
window by reserving a seat with a bag on one side and seating
himself on the other.</p>

<p>"The cloak served for a double purpose&mdash;to hide the
dispatch-box and to conceal his movements from the occupants of his
carriage when the time for action came. Fortunately, both his
companions sat with their backs to the engine, so that he was
easily able to command either window.</p>

<p>"I was to let him know which side of the train was the sphere of
action by putting out my head as we ran through Eastwood. He would
then look out of both windows and get to work accordingly.</p>

<p>"What he did was this. He had the snap-hook tied tightly to the
end of the fishing-line. By leaning out of the window and slinging
this hook on the fork of his walking-stick he was able to reach it
along the side of the carriage&mdash;holding his stick at the other
end&mdash;and slip the hook over the handle outside my door, where
it hung by its cord.</p>

<p>"He then dropped the stick and held the cord loosely in his
right hand, the slack end ready to run out. This, you will observe,
kept the hook hanging on my handle. With his left hand he drew the
dispatch-box from under his cloak and held it outside the carriage,
ready to drop it instantly.</p>

<p>"Of course he was standing all the time, with his head and
shoulders out of the window.</p>

<p>"When I leant forward to light my cigarette at the Colonel's
cigar, I slipped my left hand out of the window, easily found the
hook hanging there, grasped it, and kept it open with one finger.
Bartlett, who was watching, got ready. You can easily guess the
rest. I swung my left hand suddenly over to the dispatch-box,
Bartlett allowing the line to run through his hand, snapped the
hook over the handle before they could see what I was about, and
pitched it out of the window as lightly as possible.</p>

<p>"The same instant Bartlett dropped the duplicate box from the
train, grasped the line tightly as the real dispatch-box flew out,
and hauled it in, hand over hand. He very soon had the dispatch-box
safely stowed under his cloak, and, on reaching Dovehaven, took the
next train back to town, to the no small satisfaction of his
chief.</p>

<p>"Unluckily, I quite forgot to ask Cotterell to mention in the
wire I knew he would be sending to the police at Dovehaven to have
a dish of lentils ready for me in my brief imprisonment. It was
very awkward. But they made me an exceedingly well-cooked tapioca
pudding."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>HOW THE BISHOP KEPT HIS
APPOINTMENT</h2>

<p>"But," said the Bishop of Frattenbury,
"while&mdash;er&mdash;agreeing with you on the question of
consuming alcohol, I cannot follow what you say with regard to
animal food. Many animals were&mdash;er&mdash;in point of fact
designed by a beneficent Creator for the sustenance of human
life."</p>

<p>"You've no small opinion of yourself, my lord," rejoined Thorpe
Hazell, "if you really believe that the pig was created in order
that you might have ham for breakfast."</p>

<p>The Bishop of Frattenbury reddened. He was not accustomed to be
spoken to like this by a mere layman, and he would have resented it
even in a church dignitary.</p>

<p>"I scarcely commend your flippant way of putting things, sir,"
he rejoined severely, "even for the sake of argument. I was
alluding to the general scheme of creation, and
the&mdash;er&mdash;fitness of things."</p>

<p>"But it amounts to this: You are in favour of killing pigs, and
I am not," went on Hazell calmly, drawing a cigarette from his
case; "and the question is: Are you a better Christian for killing
your pigs, or am I, who have a certain amount of respect for the
life of a hog, which you haven't?"</p>

<p>The Bishop frowned angrily.</p>

<p>"What you say is quite beside the mark," he answered; "I am not
in the habit of taking the life of <i>any</i> animal."</p>

<p>"No; but you encourage butchery in others, which is degrading.
But to go back to the subject we were discussing. Have you ever had
any practical experience in the analysis of foodstuffs?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said the Bishop; "I'm not a chemist."</p>

<p>"More's the pity, because, being a Bishop, it might be good for
you to know something of the laws of health&mdash;capital subject
for a charge to your clergy! Now, there are four excellent foods,
each of them excelling the nutritive powers of animal
flesh&mdash;oatmeal, macaroni, lentils, and Dutch cheese."</p>

<p>And he ticked them off one by one on his fingers.</p>

<p>"Really, sir!" exclaimed the Bishop, who was now in a very bad
temper indeed, "I must ask you to excuse me from taking a further
part in this conversation."</p>

<p>And, opening the book he had been reading, with a vicious
gesture, he composed himself in the corner of the first-class
compartment in which both were travelling. Thorpe Hazell smoked his
cigarette quite calmly, a smile on his lips. He had not intended to
say anything rude, but the Bishop's dogmatic manner had rather put
his back up.</p>

<p>Presently he removed his coat, stood upright in the carriage,
and commenced throwing his arms to and fro violently.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Frattenbury laid down his book and gazed at him in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"A digestive exercise, my lord," explained Hazell, pausing for a
moment. "It is now a quarter to seven, and I hope to dine at eight.
You draw in a very deep breath&mdash;so!&mdash;then you move the
arms ten times&mdash;so!&mdash;then you exhale the
breath&mdash;slowly. It is also a safeguard against unnecessary
flesh development. You should have practised it years ago!" And he
lit a fresh cigarette.</p>

<p>There was a crash and a rattle and a heavy bumping. The Bishop
was suddenly shot forward into Hazell's arms. The lamp went out,
and total darkness followed. Then the carriage reeled like a
drunken man, the panes of glass splintered, there was a dull shock,
and Hazell, who had managed to get his hand outside the door and
open it, fell out of the compartment on to the soft turf beside the
line. He heard the Bishop follow him. A moment or two afterwards
there was a heavy splash, and then a muffled cry somewhere
below.</p>

<p>Thorpe Hazell blew the fragments of his cigarette out of his
mouth, sat up, rubbed an injured elbow, and looked around him.
There was an awful hissing of escaping steam from the engine. The
driver was on the ground, a lamp in hand; another lamp was dancing
about as the guard appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>"What's up?" cried Hazell, as he went towards the engine.</p>

<p>"She's off the line, sir," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Anyone hurt?" yelled the guard.</p>

<p>"I think not," replied the driver, "we weren't running fast.
Jim!"</p>

<p>"Hullo!"</p>

<p>"All right?"</p>

<p>"Aye, mate, I jumped the other side," exclaimed the fireman.</p>

<p>"How about the passengers?" asked Hazell of the guard.</p>

<p>"There were only four in the train, sir," replied the
guard&mdash;"two thirds&mdash;ah, here they are&mdash;yourself, and
the Bishop."</p>

<p>"Ah, the Bishop, of course," said Hazell. "I think he got out
just after me," he added, with a slight chuckle. "I hope he's not
hurt."</p>

<p>At that moment a faint cry for help came from the foot of the
embankment. Hazell and the guard hurried down, and there, by the
light of the lamp, they beheld a sorry sight. At the bottom of the
bank was a ditch, bordered by a barbed wire fence. The unfortunate
prelate had fallen into the very muddiest part of the ditch, and in
trying to emerge therefrom had caught his clothes on the barbed
wire. He was a mass of mud from head to foot, his apron hung in
ribbons, one of his coat tails was torn clean off, and one of his
sleeves ripped up from elbow to wrist. Blood was trickling down his
face from a slight cut on the cheek.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, my lord?" asked Hazell.</p>

<p>"No," replied the Bishop grimly, "I don't think so&mdash;except
a few bruises. But I'm exceedingly uncomfortable."</p>

<p>There was a look on the Bishop's muddy and bloodstained face as
the lantern flashed upon him that suddenly appealed to Hazell. He
gave him his arm and helped him up the embankment. Then they found
out what had happened to the little branch train in which they had
been travelling. The crank axle of the tiny tank engine had broken,
the leading wheels had left the rails, and one of the three
carriages composing the train had jumped the metals with the shock.
No one was hurt, and the Bishop's plight was really the worst of
the lot.</p>

<p>The line upon which the catastrophe had taken place was the
little branch one from Heston to Cathfield, a distance of some
seven miles, and a single track. Only four or five trains are timed
to run per day upon this little bit of line, and even then it
scarcely pays the company to run them, so small is the traffic.
This train, from Heston to Cathfield, was the last one of the day.
It was a winter's evening, exceedingly dark, and a hurried
consultation took place between guard and passengers as to what was
the best thing to be done.</p>

<p>"We're about three miles from Heston," said the former, "and
it's impossible, as you see, to go on. The nearest breakdown train
is at Blayford, and it's not likely that it will be despatched till
the morning. There's not a house anywhere near here, and the best
thing we can do is to walk back along the line to Heston Junction.
There's a very fair inn there where you gentlemen can get beds for
the night."</p>

<p>Then the Bishop of Frattenbury&mdash;dirty, grimy,
blood-bespattered&mdash;stood forth in his torn, fluttering
garments, and spoke.</p>

<p>"I <i>won't</i> go back to Heston," he exclaimed. "I am due to
speak at an important meeting at Redminster to-night, and I insist
upon your making some arrangements for getting me there. I
<i>must</i> be there!"</p>

<p>Hazell looked at him with admiration. The true British spirit
had come out in his lordship&mdash;the spirit of pig-headedness
that refuses to be daunted by obstacles because it has a grievance
against someone.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," said the guard, "but I don't see how you're to
get to Redminster to-night."</p>

<p>"I tell you I must be there," said the Bishop, the marks of
episcopacy manifesting themselves despite the mud. "You ought to
have guarded against this breakdown, but, since it has occurred, it
is your plain duty to devise some plan by which passengers shall
reach their destination. I am the principal speaker at this meeting
to-night, and in my whole career I have never failed to keep an
engagement. I intended catching the 7.30 from Cathfield to
Redminster, arriving at the latter place at 7.50, in time for me to
reach the hall at 8. It is your duty to assist me to do this."</p>

<p>It was splendid to hear him speak. Even the driver, who was
standing by, felt that somehow he had committed a perfectly heinous
offence, and, although he was a Baptist by choice, it began to dawn
upon him that a Bishop's anathemas might perchance affect
Nonconformists in certain cases.</p>

<p>"If it weren't for the broken axle," he said apologetically, "we
might get her on the rails with the screw-jack and try running her
on.</p>

<p>"Do so," commanded the Bishop, "and, if necessary, proceed
without the axle."</p>

<p>"It is absolutely impossible to go on," broke in Thorpe Hazell,
"but, if you are determined to speak at this meeting, I might
perhaps make a suggestion."</p>

<p>"The officials ought to get me out of the difficulty," replied
the Bishop loftily, "but what do you propose?"</p>

<p>"It is now close on seven," said Hazell, "and the distance to
Cathfield is nearly four miles along the line. It is out of the
question trying to catch the 7.30, but there is a later train which
would get you into Redminster by 8.45, and if we started walking at
once we might catch it. Perhaps you would allow me to accompany
you, as I wish to go on to Redminster myself."</p>

<p>The Bishop thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"Ahem! I suppose it is the only course to take, and I am much
obliged to you. But I shall write to the general manager," he went
on, turning to the guard.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," said that individual meekly.</p>

<p>"We ought to lose no time," said Hazell, "but&mdash;er&mdash;if
we catch that train&mdash;your lordship&mdash;well, is hardly in a
suitable costume to speak at a meeting."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed the Bishop, "I never thought of that. How
exceedingly unfortunate. I have no change in my bag,
either&mdash;only my&mdash;er&mdash;night&mdash;attire. But I could
possibly borrow a coat from one of the clergy."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," said Hazell, "if you will allow me, I have a spare
jacket I could lend you&mdash;just for the walk&mdash;that is, if
you can get into it."</p>

<p>"You're welcome to my coat," broke in the guard, with the idea
of a peace-offering in his mind. "I've another in my van&mdash;and
I'm about your size."</p>

<p>Finally, the Bishop of Frattenbury took off his coat and
tattered apron, and accepted the guard's offer. But he stuck to his
own hat, which he had left in the carriage. Then Thorpe Hazell
borrowed a lantern from the guard and set off along the track with
the Bishop, whilst the others prepared to walk back to Heston.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you will find it rather a stiff walk," said Hazell.
"Might I offer you some refreshments? I seldom travel without
them."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied the Bishop, "but I am a teetotaler."</p>

<p>"The refreshments to which I allude are chocolate and milk,"
rejoined Hazell.</p>

<p>The Bishop accepted a bit of chocolate, and they stumbled along
the centre of the single track in silence for a while. It was rough
work, but the Bishop well understood that the catching of the later
train at Cathfield meant a quick progress, and that even then it
was a mere chance. Yet the prelate was a man of grit, despite his
pompous demeanour, and he was determined that the Redminster
meeting should not lose his speech on the Education Question if he
could help it.</p>

<p>They had gone about a quarter of a mile along the track, Hazell
leading the way, and considerately directing the light of the
lantern on to the ground so that his companion might best see where
to tread, when the former suddenly uttered an exclamation of
joy.</p>

<p>The flash of his lantern had fallen upon an object lying beside
the line. He stopped short.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the Bishop.</p>

<p>"If you're agreeable, I think we might make our progress a bit
easier," said Hazell.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Here's a trolley. If we can get it on the line, we could ride
on it.</p>

<p>"But how about the motive power? I hardly see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> shall have to be the power," broke in Hazell; "and
we've not only a stiff wind behind us, but, if I am not very much
mistaken, most of the line from here to Cathfield is on a down
gradient. Kindly give me a hand!" The Bishop, in some surprise, did
as he was asked.</p>

<p>Under Hazell's directions his lordship assisted him to put the
two pairs of wheels on the rails and the heavy frame on to them.
There was a shunter's "coupling staff" among the tackle, and Hazell
placed this, together with the lamp, on the trolley.</p>

<p>"Evidently the platelayers have bagged it to push with," he
said. "Well, we may find it handy? Now, then, can you kneel on one
knee on that side? That's right. I'll take this. Press your other
foot on the ground and give a shove&mdash;so! Off we go. Can you
manage it?"</p>

<p>"It's work to which I'm scarcely accustomed," said the panting
prelate grimly, "but I'll do my best."</p>

<p>"Good!" replied Hazell, in admiration. "We're picking up speed
fast now. Steady&mdash;long strokes, please!"</p>

<p>The trolley began to run along rapidly. Presently the light of
the lamp fell with a passing flash on a short post beside the line,
with two arms, one level, and the other at a downward angle.</p>

<p>"A falling gradient!" cried Hazell. "Climb right on. That's
it!"</p>

<p>He gave the Bishop a hand while the latter struggled on to the
trolley, falling flat as he did so. He clutched his hat with one
hand and the edge of the trolley with the other. Hazell knelt,
holding the Bishop's coat just at the small of the back to steady
him. The trolley felt the momentum every instant, and was soon
running on the down grade quite furiously.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;hope&mdash;there's&mdash;no&mdash;danger!" jerked the
Bishop as he bumped. "If&mdash;we&mdash;met
a&mdash;train&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right!" broke in Hazell cheerfully. "It's a single line,
and our driver had the staff. No other train can run."</p>

<p>The exact meaning was dim to his companion, who gathered,
nevertheless, that his fears in this direction were groundless.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;suppose
the&mdash;line's&mdash;not&mdash;clear&mdash;or
the&mdash;things&mdash;they&mdash;call&mdash;points&mdash;are
not&mdash;set&mdash;right!"</p>

<p>Hazell laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't worry. There are no points between Heston Junction and
Cathfield&mdash;not even a station. It's quite safe."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;how&mdash;can we&mdash;stop?" went on the Bishop, as
the trolley bounded forward.</p>

<p>"This gradient won't last long, and we can always stop by
putting our feet on the rails and pressing&mdash;a human
brake!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;hope it&mdash;won't&mdash;end in&mdash;a&mdash;human
breakage!" exclaimed the Bishop, with a grim and noble attempt at
humour which went straight to Hazell's heart.</p>

<p>"Good old chap!" he muttered. Presently the speed began to
slacken, and the Bishop slowly rose to his knees from his recumbent
position. Simultaneously both men broke out into a hearty
laugh.</p>

<p>"Enjoying the ride?" asked Hazell.</p>

<p>"I was thinking that some of the younger clergy might enjoy
seeing me taking it," remarked the Bishop.</p>

<p>"A coincidence&mdash;so was I!"</p>

<p>"Shall we catch that other train?"</p>

<p>Hazell managed to look at his watch.</p>

<p>"Easily! We must push again a bit. I'll use the staff."</p>

<p>He stood upright to do so. The Bishop kicked out manfully once
more. As Hazell had said, the wind was behind them, helping them
tremendously. They struck another gradient&mdash;a long one this
time. Hazell looked again at his watch.</p>

<p>"It's rather different from walking," he said. "We shall be in
loads of time for the 8.45. That will get us to Redminster a little
after nine."</p>

<p>"No chance of catching the 7.30, I suppose?" asked the
Bishop.</p>

<p>"No. It's not very far off that time now&mdash;and we've the
best part of two miles to go. Besides which, the last half mile or
more is a steep up gradient, and we shall have to walk it."</p>

<p>They set to pushing again. The line was almost level now.
Presently the Bishop exclaimed: "What's that light?"</p>

<p>Far away, on their right, a sudden flash of radiance had sprung
up in the darkness of the black wintry night.</p>

<p>"Opening the coal-box to fire a locomotive," replied Hazell.
"And what's more, I'm pretty sure it's the train you wanted to
catch running along towards Cathfield. Hullo!" as he caught sight
of another gradient post, "there's a steep drop here&mdash;one in
fifty, if I recollect rightly. Jump on and hold tight! There'll be
a curve presently."</p>

<p>The trolley had already begun to gather speed. Even Hazell, who
was on the right of the Bishop, had to hold on. Once more the light
of the main line train flashed upwards, like a searchlight, and
this time Hazell gave vent to an excited "Hullo!"</p>

<p>In order to explain the thought that had suddenly struck him, it
will be necessary to give a brief description of the railway at
this particular spot. As has been said, the little single line from
Heston Junction to Cathfield was about seven miles in length. From
about two miles beyond the scene of the breakdown it bore round
gradually to the left, until at length it met the main line at a
point a little over a mile from Cathfield.</p>

<p>But this point was not a junction. That is to say, the single
line, instead of crossing on to the main by facing points
controlled by a signal-box in the angle, ran parallel on the left
of the main track all the way to Cathfield, where it had its own
little "bay" terminus.</p>

<p>This arrangement, involving a little more capital expenditure at
first, had its advantages in that the necessity for a
"junction-box" and the maintenance of its signalman was obviated,
thus making it cheaper in the long run. Similar instances may occur
to the reader, as, for example, the running of the Midhurst single
line from Fishbourne to Chichester alongside the up main South
Coast track; or the bit of the Abingdon branch that runs parallel
with the main down Great Western for some little distance into
Radley. The arrangement, also, has another advantage in leaving
both main and branch lines absolutely clear at all times.</p>

<p>Now the trolley, rushing downwards at fairly high speed, was
just approaching the point from which it would continue running
close along the main up track. And on this main up track, further
away from the point, the express, that would ultimately stop at
Cathfield, came thundering along. They were, naturally, in front of
her, and Hazell knew by her head-lights, which just appeared in
view&mdash;a green light above a white&mdash;that she was the train
in question.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he shouted, as a sudden idea took possession of
him.</p>

<p>"What's&mdash;the&mdash;matter?" cried the Bishop, who was on
the jerk again.</p>

<p>Hazell's reply was unintelligible to his lordship.</p>

<p>"The tail-lights of the branch train are a red <i>and</i> a
white, but the main-line trains carry a red light only!"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;on&mdash;earth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold <i>on!</i>"</p>

<p>They came swinging round the curve with a clatter, and then the
light of the lamp glanced on the shining up rail parallel with them
and some five feet from the right edge of the trolley.</p>

<p>Hazell looked back. The head-lights of the express were out of
sight now, there being a bit of a curve on the main line. Kneeling
upright, as well as the shaking trolley would let him, Hazell took
up the guard's lamp and turned the red shade on. Then he hooked its
handle to the hook on the end of the coupling staff.</p>

<p>"Hold on to the edge with your left hand, my lord! Right! Now
take my left hand with your other. Don't let go, for goodness'
sake. Good! Here she comes. Just in time!"</p>

<p>Holding the coupling staff with his right hand, he reached it
out, till the lantern was just over the middle of the parallel up
track, the red light pointing back towards the approaching
train.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;are&mdash;you&mdash;doing?"</p>

<p>"Trying to get you in time for your meeting!" replied Hazell.
"Hold on. We're nearly on the level now."</p>

<p>As the driver of the express came round the slight curve, he saw
the red tail-light, apparently of an up main line train, for it was
on his track, moving on in front of him. Instantly he shut off
steam and whistled furiously.</p>

<p>And then, as Hazell glanced back, he saw the sparks flying under
the train, and he knew that the Westinghouse brake was doing its
work.</p>

<p>"I can manage by myself now," he cried, for the trolley was
slackening speed. "Stop her, my lord!"</p>

<p>Very gingerly the Bishop applied the brake&mdash;to wit, his
episcopal boot&mdash;and slowly they came to a standstill. So did
the train&mdash;not fifty yards behind.</p>

<p>The front guard jumped from his van and came running forward,
expecting to see a train&mdash;or, at least, a detached truck in
the way. When he caught sight of the trolley and the two men on the
other rail, his indignation expressed itself in pretty strong
language as he inquired what they meant by it. Hazell briefly
explained the breakdown and how they had journeyed on.</p>

<p>"But, why the&mdash;did you stop my train, even if your story's
true?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Hazell imperturbably, "my friend the Bishop here
did not wish to lose his connection."</p>

<p>"Bishop be&mdash;" began the guard, as he turned his lantern on
the prelate.</p>

<p>"Hush!" checked Hazell, "his lordship is unaccustomed to such
language."</p>

<p>"A pretty Bishop!" sneered the guard, as he looked at the
extraordinary figure. "But you'll have to pay for this!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied Hazell sweetly. "We've both got first-class
tickets. But we're wasting precious time. Clear this trolley
off&mdash;we're coming with you."</p>

<p>"And I will see that you are properly recompensed," said the
Bishop loftily, recovering something of his episcopal dignity.</p>

<p>They went on in the guard's van. At Cathfield Hazell explained
matters to the stationmaster, who was getting anxious about the
non-arrival of the branch train.</p>

<p>"You'll have to settle with the authorities for stopping the
train," he said, as Hazell gave him his card.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think that will be easy enough&mdash;I've done one or two
little amateur jobs for the G.M." replied the railway expert; "he
knows me very well."</p>

<p>The run on to Redminster was in a first-class carriage.</p>

<p>"Let me thank you exceedingly for all your trouble," said the
Bishop, who was still attired in the guard's coat. "How can I repay
you for it?"</p>

<p>"Easily," replied Hazell. "May I refer to our former
conversation&mdash;just after we left Heston?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"You appeared to be sceptical as to the food values of oatmeal,
macaroni, Dutch cheese, and lentils. It would be such a pleasure to
me, my lord, if you would lose that scepticism, after personal
experience."</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand."</p>

<p>"If, in return for any small service I have rendered, you would
try these foods exclusively, with the exception of milk as a
beverage, for, say a fortnight, I'm sure you would be
convinced."</p>

<p>His lordship pressed his lips and frowned, but the frown soon
developed into a grim smile.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, "I <i>will</i>."</p>

<p>"And you will let me know?"</p>

<p>"I will let you know."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lord. Ah, here we are at Redminster. But you
cannot speak in that costume?"</p>

<p>"I shall drive straight to the Deanery first, and borrow some
clothes from the Dean. I am staying the night there."</p>

<p>At a quarter past eight the Bishop of Frattenbury, rigidly
clad&mdash;a little <i>too</i> rigidly, perhaps, for the Dean was
the sparer man of the two&mdash;was addressing a crowded meeting at
the Redminster Town Hall as only his lordship, who was famed for
platform eloquence, could.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>And here followed the postscript, after the lapse of a couple of
weeks.</p>

<blockquote>The Palace,<br>
Frattenbury.<br>
<br>
My Dear Sir,<br>
<br>
I have faithfully kept my promise to you, and strictly adhered to
the abominable diet you prescribed for a fortnight&mdash;which ends
to-night. I am much looking forward to resuming my ham for
breakfast tomorrow, and rejoice that Providence provided the
necessary animal for its production. I am still more than grateful
to you for your kind and shrewd services on the eventful evening
when I first made your acquaintance, and should you ever be in
Frattenbury, hope that you will remember that the Apostle has
enjoined bishops to be "given to hospitality." You shall, on that
occasion, have your four abominable (the word suits admirably)
foods <i>ad lib</i>., but you will find me carnivorous.<br>
<br>
Believe me,<br>
Yours very truly,<br>
G. Frattenbury.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>THE ADVENTURE OF THE PILOT
ENGINE</h2>

<p>When a special train is to be run on our railways, papers of
directions are printed and issued to station-masters and others.
These contain minute details concerning the timing of the run, and
the keeping of the line clear, how this train is to be shunted into
a refuge siding at one station, and that train has to be kept clear
at another point.</p>

<p>In the case of any important or Royal personage travelling,
these instructions are marked "private," and are jealously
guarded.</p>

<p>Some three years ago, at a juncture when European politics were
considered by diplomatists to be in a very delicate state, an
announcement might have been seen in several Continental papers to
this effect: "Count von Neglein, being slightly indisposed owing to
his arduous duties, has retired for a few days, under the direction
of his physician, to his country house at B&mdash;. He hopes to be
able to resume work in a week's time."</p>

<p>At the same time, a messenger from Downing Street called upon
the general manager of the London and East Midland Railway and gave
him an order with strict injunctions that the matter was to be kept
private.</p>

<p>A special train was required the following Tuesday to run from
London to Singlehurst. Every precaution was to be taken for the
safety of this train, as a most important person was going to
travel by it. The general manager immediately summoned the
superintendent of the line, and before the morning was out a proof
of the "special working instructions" had been laid on his desk,
damp from the company's printers.</p>

<p>That same morning three men were closeted together in a house in
the West End of London. Two of them were of a distinctly foreign
appearance, the third might have belonged to any nationality. He
was a man of medium height, clean-shaven, with close-cut hair,
ordinary features, and mild-looking grey eyes. The only thing of
any note about his face was a certain set and resolute compression
of his lips.</p>

<p>The language in which the trio were speaking was French, and the
subject under discussion was that of Count von Neglein's little
indisposition.</p>

<p>"The news is of the gravest character," said the elder of the
two foreign-looking men. "There can be no doubt about it that if
Count von Neglein has an interview with the English Prime Minister
in the presence of the King during the ensuing week our plans will
be frustrated completely."</p>

<p>"You are sure that your information is correct?" asked the other
man.</p>

<p>"Positively. Besides, Dubourg here can corroborate it," and he
turned to the third man.</p>

<p>"Quite correct," said Dubourg. "The Continental journey will be
made to Ostend, and thence to London by private boat. These little
steam yachts are handy."</p>

<p>"There is no possibility of, er&mdash;persuading the Count to
relinquish his journey on the Continent or by sea?" said the first
speaker, with a curious interrogatory lift of his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"None," replied Dubourg. "The arrangements are
excellent&mdash;for them."</p>

<p>"Well, you ought to know something about that," said the second
man.</p>

<p>Dubourg bowed slightly.</p>

<p>"It is my business," he said.</p>

<p>"The King," went on the first speaker, who was evidently the one
in authority&mdash;"the King is staying with the Duke of Worcester,
and will be there all next week. Singlehurst, I believe, is the
nearest station. The Prime Minister and the French Ambassador are
invited there to dine on Monday. That means staying the night."</p>

<p>"And that yacht will arrive early on Tuesday morning," put in
Dubourg.</p>

<p>"Exactly. Well&mdash;er&mdash;my instructions are to prevent an
interview between von Neglein and the Prime Minister at all costs.
Now, Dubourg, what have you to say?"</p>

<p>Dubourg thought for a minute, his lips tightly compressed.</p>

<p>"We must find out," he said presently, "how he is going to
travel from London to Singlehurst. If it is an ordinary train, as
you know, I have done something in this line before. But if it is a
special&mdash;well!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"It may be a question of stopping at nothing."</p>

<p>"Then stop at nothing," said the chief coldly. "If he is removed
altogether, so much the better for our interests."</p>

<p>"I will make inquiries and see you this evening," said Dubourg
rising.</p>

<p>"Do so. Good-morning. A most excellent person this Dubourg," he
went on to his companion, "he has been an engineer and an actor,
and he knows ten European languages fluently. If the thing's to be
done at all, he's the man to do it&mdash;especially if it is a
question of railways. That's his chief line."</p>

<p>The same evening Dubourg called again at the West End house. A
dinner party was in progress, and the elder of the two foreigners
sat at the head of the table, an order across his breast, and was
addressed with much deference by his guests. As soon as the servant
handed him Dubourg's card, he begged to be excused for a few
moments, and left the table.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said to Dubourg, when they were seated in his private
room.</p>

<p>Dubourg laid a printed paper on the table.</p>

<p>"It was difficult to get," he said, "but fortunately the
printers were open to a fee."</p>

<p>The paper, which was marked "Strictly Private," was headed:</p>

<p>"Instructions for working special train from London to
Singlehurst."</p>

<p>Then followed a long list of details. The train itself was to
leave the London terminus at 8.30 a.m., preceded by a pilot engine
at 8.20.</p>

<p>"They are taking extra precautions with that pilot engine,"
remarked Dubourg, with a light laugh.</p>

<p>The other looked at him narrowly.</p>

<p>"Why do you smile?"</p>

<p>"Because I think it would have been as well for Count von
Neglein's restoration to health if they had not determined to run a
pilot."</p>

<p>"It is going to be a serious affair?"</p>

<p>"Very serious. And dangerous&mdash;that is, if my plan is
successful."</p>

<p>"And your plan?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Dubourg, "I won't give you the details, lest I
should fail. But the key to it lies here."</p>

<p>And he put his finger on a paragraph of the "Instructions." The
other read:</p>

<p>"Inspector Inglis will travel on the engine of the express,
which will be worked by Driver Forbes and Fireman Scott. The pilot
engine will be worked by Driver Fraser and Fireman Norris."</p>

<p>"Four of the best enginemen on the line," remarked Dubourg. "I
happened to see Driver Fraser and Fireman Norris bring a train in
to-day&mdash;excellent men!"</p>

<p>"I don't see your point, but I know I can trust you. Koravitch,
who was with us this morning, will give you any funds or
assistance."</p>

<p>"I shall want the latter. To-morrow I am going to make certain
inquiries about Fireman Norris. I've taken quite a fancy to the
look of him. On Monday I shall take a journey down the line, merely
to refresh my memory of a few details. I shall be back that
evening. If my little plan succeeds, I don't think there will be
any interview. Good-night!"</p>

<p>Late on Monday evening, Dubourg sat in his lodgings poring over
a rough map of a section of the London and East Midland line that
he had made as the result of his trip that day, and referring
closely to the "Special Working Instructions" that lay beside it on
the table.</p>

<p>The first fifty miles of the London and East Midland consist of
a quadruple track, the two main lines on the left for up and down
fast trains, and the others "relief lines" for slow trains. There
are places where a train can cross from the main line to the
relief, or <i>vice versa</i>, the points being, of course,
controlled by signal-boxes; and there are also places where, for
shunting purposes, trains can cross from the down line to the up,
or <i>vice versa</i>, but in this case they must first stop and
then reverse.</p>

<p>Thirty-five miles down the line is Rushwood Station. Two and
a-half miles further is Alton Siding Box, which commands crossing
points on the relief line only, the main line metals being clear.
Five miles on is Holt Box, where points are so arranged that trains
may cross in all the ways I have mentioned. Half-a-mile further is
the long Roxton Tunnel, with a signal-box at the entrance.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1300071h-images/p106.jpg" width=
"1000" border="1">
</p>

<p>When a train has passed the Roxton Box the man on duty signals
"line clear" to Holt, and the signalman at Holt is free to admit a
train on his section from Alton Siding Box.</p>

<p>In the case of very special trains, such as those carrying
Royalty, and when a pilot engine is used, all traffic on the
adjacent line must come to a standstill between the passage of the
"pilot" and the "special" following it; while, with regard to
trains running in the same direction on relief lines, a stop must
be made for extra precaution wherever there is a crossing-over
place, when the "special" is timed to run by on the main line just
at that moment.</p>

<p>The two special notices which Dubourg was studying so intensely
were these&mdash;</p>

<p>"Directions to the signalman on duty at Holt Box. Light engine
No. 321, running on the up line to Rushwood, must stop opposite
box, and the 9.5 local down passenger train from Rushwood must be
stopped outside facing points on relief line during passing of
pilot and special."</p>

<p>A "light engine," by the way, is an engine running by
itself.</p>

<p>The man called Koravitch came in presently and glanced at the
map.</p>

<p>"Well, Dubourg," he said, "is everything ready?"</p>

<p>"So far as it can be," replied the other. "There are several
weak spots in the plan, but I must trust to luck. And here is the
weakest, I think."</p>

<p>He laid his finger on the rough map at the point marking the
Roxton Tunnel Box.</p>

<p>"As for myself," he went on, "it is a risky thing. After our
little business of to-morrow morning you must start off with the
motor. I want you to be waiting a little after nine on the main
road just outside the village of Roxton, on the London side. Are
all the other things ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The carriage?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Our men are warned."</p>

<p>"Good! Then we'll have some rest. Six o'clock to-morrow, mind.
It'll be quite dark then."<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>About half-a-mile from the terminus of the London and East
Midland Railway are a couple of streets of small houses belonging
to the company, and entirely occupied by railwaymen. You may see
them going in and out of their houses at all hours of the day or
night. Drivers and firemen starting to "work" trains to the
Midlands, goods brakesmen returning after a weary run up, smart
guards, dingy engine-cleaners, the rank and file of the great
railway army.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark on the morning of the eventful Tuesday, when a
closed carriage drove up to one of these little houses, and a man,
with his cap drawn down over his face, sprang out and rapped
violently at the door. The people were well accustomed to these
sudden calls, especially in foggy weather. A minute later and a
window opened, and a head appeared at it.</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Walters," growled the man below. "I want Norris at
once."</p>

<p>"I'm Norris, sir."</p>

<p>"Sharp, then. You're firing the pilot for the special?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but she don't start till 8.20."</p>

<p>"There's an alteration. Quick! Put on your clothes and hurry
up!"</p>

<p>The window was shut down, and in a very few minutes Norris came
out of the house, clad in his working clothes and ready for the
"run," his little bag with provisions and the familiar blue tea-can
in his hand.</p>

<p>"There's not a moment to lose," said the supposed Mr. "Walters,"
holding the door of the cab open. "Jump in&mdash;Fraser has gone
on."</p>

<p>Norris got into the cab, and Dubourg, for it was he, followed.
The driver whipped up his horse, and before the unfortunate fireman
had realised what was happening, he found himself in the grasp of
two powerful men, who snicked a pair of handcuffs on his wrists,
and then proceeded to gag him.</p>

<p>"Now, if you keep still," said Dubourg, "we won't hurt you; but,
if you make any resistance or refuse to do what we tell you, I
can't answer for the consequences."</p>

<p>They drove along at a furious pace, and presently drew up at a
house in Camden Town, the door of which opened immediately. Dubourg
and Koravitch took the fireman by the arms and hurried him into the
house, the door was closed by a third man, and the cab drove
off.</p>

<p>The room into which they carried Norris was brilliantly lighted,
and a looking-glass stood on the table. Dubourg lost no time.</p>

<p>"We're going to trouble you for your clothes, my friend," he
said quietly, "and then you shall enjoy a rest."</p>

<p>In ten minutes the fireman had his outer clothes stripped from
him and Dubourg had put them on. Then he opened a small tin case,
took out a wig, some false hair, spirit gum, and other makeup
materials, and set to work on his own face, carefully studying
first Norris and then the reflection in the looking-glass. In a
very short time he was transformed into the exact likeness of the
fireman. By this time Koravitch had gone, but not before he had
assisted the other man in binding Norris securely.</p>

<p>"Now," said Dubourg to Norris, as he put a small life-preserver
in his own pocket and carefully examined a revolver, "you'll suffer
no inconvenience beyond remaining here for a few hours. A letter
will be posted to your wife stating where you are, and she'll
receive it this afternoon. I'm sorry to leave you gagged, but there
are neighbours who might hear you."</p>

<p>With that he walked out of the house with his
fellow-conspirators.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Dubourg went his way to the engine-sheds of the London and East
Midland Railway to all appearances an ordinary fireman, returning
nods of greeting which were given him by men he met.</p>

<p>He had served in the secret service of a powerful European
nation for ten years now, and his chief work had been in connection
with railways, steamers, and other methods of travelling. Railways
and their working were his speciality, and to a man who had driven
locomotives scores of times, the details of a fireman's work were
nothing. He knew exactly what was required, and gave in his name at
the check office with as much unconcern as if he had been Norris
himself, glancing at the notice board with quite a practised
eye.</p>

<p>Fraser had arrived before him, and, lamp and oil-can in hand,
was in the pit beneath the great engine, carefully inspecting every
portion of the works. He gave a nod to his mate presently, as he
joined him on the foot-plate; it was dark inside the engine-shed,
and he did not notice anything strange.</p>

<p>Afterwards Dubourg took care to keep his face turned away from
him as far as possible, besides which, it was a gloomy winter's
morning, and men on the footplate have too much to do to look
narrowly into each other's faces. Their eyes are fixed on other
things, and driver and firemen on duty are not talkers. A dozen
words in a hundred miles' run is often as much as they
exchange.</p>

<p>Presently they "whistled up" to be run off the shed road, backed
down to the "special," and stood at the end of the platform ready
to start. Dubourg forgot nothing. He saw that the tail-light was
properly fixed on the back of the tender&mdash;there were tunnels
on the route&mdash;he placed the special head discs, denoting the
character of the engine, in front of the smoke-box, and when a
loco. inspector strolled up to the engine, he gave a twist to the
hand-brake in the most approved manner.</p>

<p>Punctually to the minute they moved out. Dubourg stood slightly
behind the driver, carefully noting the pressure-gauge, the needle
of which soon began to move up as the blast operated. Directly the
steam began to "blow off" at the valve he was ready for coaling. In
a few seconds, as the needle began to go up once more, he commenced
to put the feed on by setting the injector to work, screwing down
the water-regulating wheel with such easy method and adjustment,
that the driver's suspicions were never once aroused.</p>

<p>So the "pilot" ran on.</p>

<p>A dozen words had not been exchanged between the two men, so
perfect was the working of both. Exactly at scheduled time they
passed Rushwood, and the pseudo-fireman began to keep a sharp look
out on his own account. At Holt Box he noted, with much
satisfaction, that the local train stood on the "down relief," and
the light engine on the "up main," according to instructions.</p>

<p>The half mile on to Roxton commenced with a sharp curve after
leaving Holt, and through a deep cutting. One more coaling
operation, and Dubourg had his hand in his pocket, grasping the
life-preserver.</p>

<p>The instant the train had entered the tunnel he acted. With his
left hand he dashed off Fraser's cap, standing behind him, and at
the same moment, struck him on the top of the head with his weapon.
The driver, stunned with the blow, fell on the footplate like a
log. Dubourg sprang to the regulator, shut off steam, and then put
on the brake, the engine coming to a standstill in the tunnel.</p>

<p>Now came the ticklish part of his dastardly plan, and well he
knew it. The signalman he had just passed at the mouth of the
tunnel was like a sentry, to be overcome by foul means, before he
could attain his object. But Dubourg was a man absolutely devoid of
either fear or feeling.</p>

<p>Reversing his engine, he slowly backed out of the tunnel,
stopping before the box, to the intense surprise of its occupant.
The latter came rushing out on to the platform outside his door,
first glancing to see that his signals were set against the
"special."</p>

<p>"What's up?" he cried.</p>

<p>"This!" shouted. Dubourg.</p>

<p>There was a sharp crack as his hand flew up with something
glittering in it. The signalman staggered to his door, but fell on
the threshold. Dubourg, calm as ever, lifted the insensible form of
the driver and dropped him beside the track. Then he threw open the
regulator and jumped off himself.</p>

<p>The engine began to move backwards.</p>

<p>Very coolly Dubourg mounted the steps of the signal box. He
stooped to look at the man.</p>

<p>"H'm! Don't think I've killed him," he muttered.</p>

<p>Then he went into the box, deliberately selected an instrument,
and gave the signal "Line clear" back to Holt Box.</p>

<p>And all the time that pilot engine was running back on the very
metals over which the special was approaching. The signal that
would have been given by the man on duty would have warned his
colleague at Holt in time for him to clear off the light engine
which stood there to the "up relief," and cross the runaway engine
over to the "up main." The next moment Dubourg was running across
country to catch his motor and escape.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>The signalman at Holt Box stood in front of his instruments,
expecting every moment the sharp ringon his bell warning him from
Alton Siding that the special was passing that point and entering
upon the section between them. He never dreamt of any danger,
having received the signal from Roxton Box that the line ahead was
perfectly clear beyond that point.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a roar and a rattle round the curve and, as he
glanced in that direction, his horrified gaze met the runaway pilot
engine. Never was signalman placed in such an awful dilemma. The
immediate danger crowded all else from his mind as he grasped a
lever.</p>

<p>There flashed before him this:</p>

<p>If he set the crossing-points the pilot would crash into the
light engine on the "up main." If he set the other points it would
come into collision with the passenger train standing on the "down
relief." There were but a few seconds in which to choose either
course, and in his hesitation he lost them. The engine ran by both
sets of points. At that moment there came the signal from Alton
Siding Box:</p>

<p>"Train entering section."</p>

<p>Dubourg had made his calculations with diabolical cunning. For
even if the special had not passed Alton Box, and it had been
possible to stop her there, unless she could have pulled up and
backed into Rushwood in time, which was hardly likely, the smash
would still have taken place, there being no crossing points at
Alton over which the runaway engine could be switched.</p>

<p>The case stood thus:</p>

<p>The special, with Count von Neglein aboard her, and the pilot
engine were rushing towards each other on a five-mile stretch of
line with absolutely no possibility of changing metals, the former
travelling at fifty and the latter at forty miles an hour. Surely
it seemed that Dubourg's diabolical plot could never be frustrated
by human means.</p>

<p>But it was, through a page-boy in the first instance, and
through Thorpe Hazell in the actual working.</p>

<p>It came about in this way. Hazell had had in his employment a
sharp boy named Sam Thorne. Making a change, however, in his
domestic establishment which led to the employment of an older
servant instead, this page-boy had left him and had taken a
situation in a large boarding-house in Bloomsbury, the very house,
as it happened, where Dubourg had his apartments.</p>

<p>On the Monday night when Dubourg was discussing affairs with
Koravitch, Sam Thorne came into the room with some hot water and
glasses. He overheard Dubourg make a remark in which he caught the
words "Holt Signal Box," and his quick eye caught sight of the map
of the railway which was lying on the table and the words "Special
Working Instructions" on the paper beside it. Neither of the men
dreamt that the boy had noticed anything.</p>

<p>Now while he had been in service with Hazell, Sam Thorne had
gained a great admiration for his master as a railway expert,
especially as, on one occasion, he had been made use of in finding
out some little detail. He knew well how much Hazell loved getting
hold of any mystery of the line.</p>

<p>The idea that something was up struck him forcibly, the fact
that Dubourg had asked to be called at five o'clock exciting his
suspicions. He was a boy of strong imagination and of action, so he
determined to put Hazell on the track. For this purpose he begged
paper and envelope of the cook, and scrawled the following
effusion:</p>

<blockquote>Dear Sir,<br>
<br>
Two furrin men staying here are up to something to-morrow&mdash;I
think about railways. Is there a place called Holt Signal Box on
the London and East Midland? And they were looking at speshul
working instruckshuns. I saw them, and I thought Ide let you
no.<br>
<br>
Yours truely,<br>
Sam Thorne.</blockquote>

<p>It was nearly ten o'clock. Sam asked leave to post his letter,
and as soon as he was outside the house he started off for Hazell's
flat, taking a 'bus on the way. Here he found that Hazell was out
of town, but had left his address with the porter. He was staying
in the country at Holmfield.</p>

<p>"Better post it if it's particular. He'll get it to-morrow
morning," said the man.</p>

<p>"It's very particular," replied the boy. "Give us a stamp,
gov'nor."</p>

<p>He posted the letter, and received an awful wigging when he got
back at half-past eleven. But he felt, somehow, that he had done
his duty&mdash;even if the letter arrived too late.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Hazell got it at breakfast the next
morning. He read it with a smile at first. Then he suddenly
remembered that an official had told him the previous Saturday that
a very important special was to be run that morning on the L. and
E.M. He did not know, of course, who was to travel in it, but the
mention of "two furrin men" aroused his suspicions.</p>

<p>Holmfield was a village in the heart of the country, devoid of
railway or telegraph. But there was one point about the
place&mdash;it was within fifteen miles of Roxton, and not much
further, therefore, from Holt Box.</p>

<p>"Weston," exclaimed Hazell to his host, pulling out his watch at
the same time, "you will have to excuse me, but this letter has
disturbed me greatly. Will you lend me your bicycle and a local
map? I want to be off in ten minutes."</p>

<p>The other, rather surprised, acquiesced, and in ten minutes
Hazell was pedalling for all he was worth on the Roxton Road, keen
on discovery, but little dreaming what was before him.</p>

<p>After riding some fifteen miles he deviated from the main road
by a turning that his map showed him would lead him along the line
close by Holt Box. He reached the top of a little hill commanding a
view of the railway, and as he did so he saw the pilot engine run
through. He could also discern the stationary train and light
engine, and these facts told him at once that the engine running
through must be the pilot of a special. He wondered, as he rode on,
whether anything really was likely to happen, or whether he had
only had a false alarm. Presently he arrived opposite Holt
Box&mdash;which was on the further side of the line&mdash;got off
his bicycle, and climbed the railing. He was now exactly opposite
the light engine.</p>

<p>At that moment he saw what the terrified signalman had
grasped&mdash;the reversed pilot engine running back. He even heard
the two strokes of the bell that announced to his practised ear the
entering of the special on the same section, and he knew in an
instant the awful danger. An idea swept upon him like an
inspiration. Dashing over the metals he made for the light engine,
climbed the foot-plate, and cried to the astonished driver:</p>

<p>"Open the regulator&mdash;quick&mdash;brakes off, fireman. We
can save her!"</p>

<p>He had seized the regulator himself as he spoke, and the engine
had already begun to move, the fireman mechanically taking off the
brake, the driver standing dumb-stricken.</p>

<p>"<i>Overtake her!</i>" yelled Hazell, pointing towards the
retreating pilot.</p>

<p>Then the driver grasped his meaning.</p>

<p>"It's an awful risk," he cried, as he took the regulator,
"steady, mate"&mdash;to the fireman&mdash;"don't coal her, man,
yet&mdash;for Heaven's sake. We shall want all our steam."</p>

<p>"How long have we got?" asked Hazell.</p>

<p>"Two minutes at the outside," replied the man; "will you do it,
sir&mdash;or shall I?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"It's dangerous&mdash;fearful."</p>

<p>"I know. Go on!"</p>

<p>The driver carefully "notched up" with his reversing wheel, and
got her out of "full throw" as the speed increased. The pilot had a
fair start, and nearly six hundred yards separated them now. He and
Hazell looked grimly ahead. The distance between the engines
gradually grew less. The driver glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"Half a minute gone!"</p>

<p>Then he muttered:</p>

<p>"She's not running more than forty; she's in full gear, thank
God!"</p>

<p>Which means that the pilot's cylinders were fully open to steam,
and that, at the speed at which she was running, the strokes of the
piston were somewhat retarded.</p>

<p>Another thirty seconds passed in anxious silence. At length
there were only fifty yards between the engines.</p>

<p>"Look out, sir!" cried the driver.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, sir?" asked the fireman, speaking for
the first time.</p>

<p>"Jump!" said Hazell.</p>

<p>"You <i>can't</i>, sir!"</p>

<p>"I'll try, anyway," replied Hazell, going to the side. Twenty
seconds more and the two engines were running side by side.</p>

<p>"Keep her so, driver! Steady!"</p>

<p>At length the footplates were opposite, some three feet of space
separating them. Hazell grasped the handrails and calculated the
distance. Then he gave a forward spring, and landed fair on the
pilot's step, clutching at her handrail.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he cried as he flew at the regulator, closed it,
and turned on the brake. Then he glanced over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Not a quarter of a mile behind the special suddenly came round a
slight curve. There was a furious whistling, then the white steam
was shut off, and a minute later the train had stopped, barely a
hundred yards from the engine that had so nearly destroyed her.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>The affair was hushed up. The loco. inspector and Driver Hicks,
of the light engine, went forward with the pilot, while the light
engine was run on to Rushwood by her fireman. Hazell accompanied
him, and took train to Roxton to recover his bicycle&mdash;walking
out to Holt Box afterwards.</p>

<p>Von Neglein only knew that "a block had occurred on the line,"
and his views of English railways were rather lowered in
consequence.</p>

<p>The signalman at Roxton and the driver of the pilot both
recovered, an important treaty was duly signed, and a "diplomatic
triumph" ensued.</p>

<p>Dubourg was never discovered, in fact, the police received an
intimation that it was useless to pursue their "clues," and the
railway officials in high places were also advised to hold their
tongues. So they did. As to Hazell, he was warmly thanked by the
superintendent of the line, and Driver Hicks was substantially
rewarded for the part he had played in what might have been an
awful tragedy.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>THE STOLEN NECKLACE</h2>

<p>Thorpe Hazell was dining at his club. They were accustomed to
his eccentricities there, and hardly a member had looked up from
his newspaper when he had divested himself of his coat, and gravely
gone through his "digestive exercises" in a convenient corner
before proceeding to the dining-room. Here preparation had been
made, for he had told the head-waiter he was coming. A table was
reserved, and on it stood a carafe of milk, a little loaf of brown
bread, and a dish of his favourite biscuits. A bowl&mdash;he never
would use a soup-plate&mdash;of lentil soup was soon put before
him, and he commenced his meal.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Hazell," said a voice presently, as the speaker clapped
him on the shoulders, "don't you overfeed yourself, old chap!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, is it, Masters?" exclaimed Hazell, as he looked
up. "I thought you were out of town."</p>

<p>"So I was till half-an-hour ago. I've just come up by the
West-Northern, and I'm frantically hungry. Thought I'd come round
for a meal at once before going to my chambers."</p>

<p>Hazell motioned him to take a seat at his table. The waiter came
up and presented the menu. Hazell listened while his friend ordered
dinner. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Oxtail soup is very heating. Whiting is a fish that ought to be
cooked within two hours of catching. Curry is deadly for the liver.
How you can digest Welsh rarebit is more than I can imagine, and
alcohol in any form has been proved by the leading doctors to be a
poison."</p>

<p>Frank Masters laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Your life must be a misery to you, Hazell!"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I never suffer from indigestion."</p>

<p>"Neither do I."</p>

<p>"Not now, perhaps, but your old age will be a misery to
you."</p>

<p>"How do you know yours won't, too? You haven't put that to the
test with your system yet!"</p>

<p>Hazell shook his head sadly as the other fell to on his soup.
There were few converts to be made at the club.</p>

<p>"Did you have a good run up to town?" asked Hazell
presently.</p>

<p>"Capital."</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"Redminster."</p>

<p>"Ah, you took the express arriving in town at 7.28?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Bradshaw!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Bradshaw" was Thorpe Hazell's nickname at the club, and he
rather rejoiced in it than otherwise. No man ever, attempted the
fag of looking at a railway guide when Hazell was near at hand.</p>

<p>"Was it in to time?"</p>

<p>"To the minute."</p>

<p>"Generally is. Did you notice whether a compound drew it?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"A compound locomotive."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I haven't the slightest idea what you mean. As
long as I get to my journey's end I don't worry about the engine.
Jolly good train, that express. No stop at all except at Wisden
Junction, and I can't see the necessity for that."</p>

<p>"They take tickets there," replied Hazell.</p>

<p>"I know. But why the johnny can't collect 'em on the train
instead of only just looking at 'em is one of those railway
mysteries that you know more about than I do."</p>

<p>"They could collect them on the train, of course," replied
Hazell, "or even at Redminster. But there's another reason why the
train stops at Wisden&mdash;in case there are any passengers for
South London."</p>

<p>"Then why do they disturb you on the train, and make you hunt in
all your pockets just to see your ticket?"</p>

<p>"They don't," said Hazell, in blunt contradiction, as he helped
himself liberally to boiled rice&mdash;for his second course had
just arrived.</p>

<p>"But I tell you they do," replied his friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Hazell, "it must be something new. I travelled
by that train a fortnight ago, and they didn't do it then.
Oh&mdash;what an ass I am! Of course, I know what it was. A ticket
inspector must have been on the train. The railway companies are
not so foolish as you think, Masters, and they often catch fellows
in that way."</p>

<p>The conversation took a general turn, and, after a bit, Hazell
finished his meal and said good-night to his friend, with another
gentle remonstrance against the savoury he was enjoying.</p>

<p>The next morning he had scarcely finished breakfast at his flat
when there came a ring, and he heard his servant show someone into
his study. The next moment he was looking at a visiting card.</p>

<p>"Miss St. John Mallaby."</p>

<p>When he went into the study he found himself confronted by a
remarkably pretty young lady, whose face, however, was wearing a
very anxious expression.</p>

<p>"I hope you don't mind my coming here, Mr. Hazell," she began,
"but I think you've met my brother."</p>

<p>"Do sit down," he answered, "yes, of course I have."</p>

<p>"He told me about you, and what a clever railway detective you
are, and I've come to you. I thought you might advise me." Hazell
smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I have a reputation that I don't deserve," he said.
"I'm scarcely a railway detective, as you put it."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you <i>will</i> help me&mdash;please!" said the girl
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Of course, I'll do anything I can for you, Miss Mallaby. But
tell me what it's about?"</p>

<p>"I don't want anyone to know&mdash;I mean I want you to promise
you won't tell anyone. I'm in great trouble. I've done something
awfully wrong, and it's like a judgment on me."</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," replied Hazell gravely, "before you make a
confidant of me are you sure that it is wise to do so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes. Because you may be able to help
me. Please let me tell you."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Hazell encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Well, I've lost a diamond necklace!" she blurted out.</p>

<p>Hazell nodded and waited.</p>

<p>"I ought not to have worn it all," she went on, "and that's the
terrible part of it. It belongs to my aunt. I'm staying at her
house in town. You see it's going to be mine one day&mdash;she has
promised to give it to me when I come of age, and that's why I
borrowed it."</p>

<p>"Suppose," said Hazell kindly, "you begin at the beginning and
try to tell me exactly what has happened?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, as well as I can. My mother and I came up last
week to stay with aunt for the season. It was then that she showed
me the necklace. I'd often heard about it, for it's been in the
family a long time. Well, last Monday aunt had to go away
unexpectedly, owing to her brother being taken ill. She left her
keys in charge of mother. On Tuesday I was to go down to Appledon
to Sir Roland Hartingford's. His daughter, who is a great friend of
mine, came of age that day, and there was a ball at the house. Just
before I started, the idea suddenly struck me that I would dearly
love to wear the necklace at the dance. I know it was awfully wrong
of me, but the temptation was a strong one, and I found myself
saying that if aunt had been at home she would have lent me the
diamonds. And then I yielded and took them."</p>

<p>"How did you get them?"</p>

<p>"It was very simple. I had to borrow my mother's keys for
something, and she gave me her chatelaine. In it were the other
keys. Almost before I realised what I had done, I had gone into my
aunt's room and unlocked the safe which is fixed there. The
necklace was in a small leather case. I took it out, locked up the
safe again, and gave my mother back the keys."</p>

<p>"Did you tell her what you had done?"</p>

<p>"No. She does not know even yet."</p>

<p>"Where did you put the necklace?"</p>

<p>"In my dressing-case, which contains my own jewellery and which
never leaves me when I travel. Well, I went down to Appledon with
my maid and wore the diamonds at the ball. It was on the return
journey&mdash;yesterday&mdash;that I lost them."</p>

<p>"In the train?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That's why I came to you, Mr. Hazell. At least, I think it
<i>must</i> have been in the train&mdash;and yet&mdash;I hardly
know what to say. It is all so terrible."</p>

<p>"Well, you must try to tell me."</p>

<p>The girl thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"Appledon is on a branch line," she said, "and you join the main
line at Redminster."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Hazell indulgently.</p>

<p>"It must have happened in the main line train, because after we
had got in I wanted something from my case and unlocked it. The
necklace was there then; I'm positive of that."</p>

<p>"What train was it?"</p>

<p>"The 5.40 express from Redminster. I was travelling with my maid
in a first-class compartment. It was a corridor train."</p>

<p>"Was anyone else in the carriage with you?"</p>

<p>The girl hesitated and blushed slightly. Then she said:</p>

<p>"One of the guests at Appledon&mdash;Mr. Kestron was coming up
to town by the same train, and he travelled with me."</p>

<p>"The Honourable George Kestron?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I know him slightly," replied Hazell, remembering that a rumour
was abroad to the effect that this same Kestron was rather hard
up&mdash;had borrowed money, so it was said.</p>

<p>Miss Mallaby noticed a certain tone in Hazell's voice as he
replied.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;<i>no</i>!" she exclaimed, "I can't suspect him."</p>

<p>"Had you, then?" asked Hazell.</p>

<p>"The thought <i>would</i> come into my head. It was partly for
that reason that I did not go to the police. Oh, Mr. Hazell, I
don't know what to think."</p>

<p>"Well, go on with your story, please. Perhaps you will tell me
how you were seated in the carriage?"</p>

<p>She explained that she was at first seated in the corner next to
the corridor with her back to the engine, and Kestron was opposite.
Her maid was on her left by the window, with the dressing-case,
covered over by a rug, between them. After a while, Kestron had
suggested changing places, as she had said something about
travelling with her back to the engine. She was careful to move the
dressing-case over to her side. Afterwards Kestron had changed his
place again and had sat next to her until Wisden Junction was
reached&mdash;the dressing-case being between them.</p>

<p>"Have you known Mr. Kestron long?" asked Hazell.</p>

<p>"I had only met him a few times before the ball. We danced a
good deal together that night, but I had not known him very
long&mdash;that was why I asked my maid to stay in the
compartment."</p>

<p>"How came he to travel with you?"</p>

<p>"He had asked me the night before what train I was going
by."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, when did you miss the necklace?"</p>

<p>She told him it was after the train had left Wisden Junction.
She put her hand into the outside pocket of the case, where she
kept her purse, and discovered, to her horror, that a long slit had
been cut through the inner side. She unlocked the case, and the
necklace was missing. Kestron had got out at Wisden, having to take
a train from there on business before he went home that night.</p>

<p>"Do you know his address?" asked Hazell.</p>

<p>"Lancaster Crescent&mdash;number eight, I think."</p>

<p>Having discovered the loss of the jewels, she was terribly
upset, and even asked her maid if she had taken them. The latter
was indignant, and wanted to be searched on the spot. They looked
everywhere in the compartment. It was still broad daylight, and she
was certain that neither of them had left the compartment between
Redminster and Wisden.</p>

<p>"Did anyone else come in?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;even the ticket-collector only opened the door, and
stood half outside when he asked to see our tickets."</p>

<p>Hazell suddenly remembered that the friend with whom he had been
dining on the previous evening had travelled by the same train. He
thought for a minute, and then asked her to tell him how the three
were seated when the ticket-collector came, and who gave him the
tickets.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kestron was next to me&mdash;it was after he had changed
places the second time. I handed his ticket to the man, who glanced
at it and returned it. My maid had both our tickets&mdash;she
always sees to that&mdash;and she showed them to him."</p>

<p>"But as she was near the window, how did she do it?"</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed the girl rather petulantly, "she naturally
moved across to him."</p>

<p>"I see," said Hazell thoughtfully. "The corridor, of course, was
on the <i>left</i> as you faced the engine. Can you remember
whether the ticket-collector came from the front or back of the
train, and whereabouts your carriage was in the train?"</p>

<p>"About the middle. The collector came from the front, but he had
passed along the corridor just before."</p>

<p>"Only <i>just</i> before?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ah! Well, I think you've told me all I want to know. It's a
troublesome case. By the way, what happened when you arrived at the
terminus?"</p>

<p>"My aunt's brougham was there to meet me, and the footman got my
luggage from the van. My maid and I went straight to the brougham.
I was foolish, perhaps, but I didn't tell anyone what had happened.
I dreaded the police knowing. I felt like a thief myself.
And&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You suspected Mr. Kestron, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Her eyes fell before his gaze, and she nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder," said Hazell.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;do you think he took it, Mr. Hazell? I
don't know what to do about it&mdash;and my aunt comes home this
evening. I shall have to tell her. If&mdash;if&mdash;he took it,
are you going to try to find out?"</p>

<p>"I shall have to keep you in suspense for a little while, Miss
Mallaby," said Thorpe Hazell. "I want you to go straight home and
say nothing about this visit. Please give me your address, and I
will call as soon as possible&mdash;to-day, I expect. I can't
promise anything, but there is just a chance of getting on the
track."</p>

<p>She thanked him. He put on his hat and saw her to the door,
where her taxi was waiting. Then he hailed another and directed the
driver to take him quickly to the terminus of the West-Northern
Railway.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said as he got out. "I shall want you again
directly."</p>

<p>He made his way to the office of the traffic-manager, whom he
knew.</p>

<p>"I want some information," he said. "Will you tell me if there
was a ticket-collector or inspector on the 5.40 p.m. express from
Redminster last evening?"</p>

<p>"Another mystery?" asked the official.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but the chances are against a solution, I'm
afraid."</p>

<p>The manager rang for a clerk and gave some orders. In ten
minutes' time the report was brought in. <i>No ticket inspector or
collector had been on the train</i>.</p>

<p>"That settles it," cried Hazell. "I'd advise you to look after
your old uniforms, Mr. Street. Good-morning."</p>

<p>His next move was to drive to Frank Masters, whom he found busy
with a pile of briefs in front of him.</p>

<p>"Sorry to disturb you," said Hazell, "but the matter is of
importance. It's about your railway journey last night. That
ticket-collecting incident is the clue to a mystery. Can you
remember what the fellow was like?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A man with a black beard and moustache, and rather a gruff
voice."</p>

<p>"After he'd looked at your ticket did he go back along the
corridor?"</p>

<p>"No. He passed first, and asked for tickets Coming back."</p>

<p>"From the front of the train&mdash;yes, I know. Now, whereabouts
in the carriage were you&mdash;which compartment were you in, I
mean?"</p>

<p>"The last but two&mdash;a first-class."</p>

<p>"Last but two from the engine?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"H'm. I wish I knew about those two compartments behind
you."</p>

<p>"I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Good!" ejaculated Hazell. "How?"</p>

<p>"There was a fellow in my compartment who lit an Egyptian
cigarette. I can't stand the smell of 'em, so I went out."</p>

<p>"After the tickets were looked at?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;some ten minutes later&mdash;just before we got to
Wisden. The next compartment was evidently reserved for ladies, so
I avoided it; the last was a second class, but I didn't mind that.
There was only one man in it."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's grand," cried Hazell, with great glee. "I'll have a
drink on the strength of it." And he pulled out his milk flask.</p>

<p>"What was he like?" he went on.</p>

<p>"A clean-shaven fellow, with the exception of slight whiskers.
He was reading a paper when I went in."</p>

<p>"That's the man I want," said Hazell. "You see, I happen to know
that the doors at the ends of the coaches on this train were
locked, the key being with the guard. So it was impossible that
anyone could get through to the next coach. If only I could find
out where that man is now!"</p>

<p>Masters wheeled round his chair suddenly.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me why you want to know?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I can't, my dear chap."</p>

<p>"Will you assure me, then, that no harm will come of it if I can
give you a clue?"</p>

<p>"On the other hand, you will be doing a very great service in
the cause of justice."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. I took a taxi straight to the club when I
arrived at the terminus. And I happened to notice that my
travelling companion took the next on the rank. He had a large
Gladstone and a smaller bag with him."</p>

<p>"That settles it. I'm off," exclaimed Hazell.</p>

<p>In half an hour's time he was back at the terminus, in
consultation with the cab inspector, who keeps watch at the station
gates.</p>

<p>"I want the number and destination of the taxi that followed
immediately after the one bound for the Avenue Club last
evening&mdash;from the 7.35 from Redminster."</p>

<p>He knew, of course, that every cabman has to shout out his
destination to the inspector as he passes the little office at the
gate. The man consulted his book.</p>

<p>"Number 28,533. Destination, Eight, Lancaster Crescent."</p>

<p>Thorpe Hazell stood as one stunned.</p>

<p>"Kestron's address!" he muttered to himself. "The girl must have
been right, after all. It's pretty bad!"</p>

<p>"I think you'll find the taxi on the rank now, sir," went on the
inspector.</p>

<p>It was there, and in answer to his inquiries the driver informed
Hazell that the address was quite correct, and that his fare had
certainly gone in at number eight.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for her," said Hazell to himself, as he told his own
cabman to drive him there; "but at least I can try to bluff him.
Still, it's very strange. There's a hitch in my reasoning
somewhere. Except, of course, this man must have been his tool. I
can't make it out."</p>

<p>He rang the bell of number eight, and a servant opened the
door.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Kestron in?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; he went out half an hour ago."</p>

<p>Thorpe Hazell paused, then he said:</p>

<p>"Ah, he has returned from the country, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He came back late last night."</p>

<p>"About eight?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; not till after ten."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Hazell nonchalantly, "I thought he returned by the
train arriving at about half-past seven and drove straight
home."</p>

<p>"No, sir; the valet came back with the luggage then, but Mr.
Kestron arrived later."</p>

<p>Instantly the solution flashed across his mind. Producing
half-a-sovereign, he said to the girl: "I want to see his
valet."</p>

<p>The girl looked at him doubtfully, and hesitated.</p>

<p>"I am a friend of your master," said Hazell quietly.</p>

<p>Then the bribe acted. In a couple of minutes the valet came into
the room where Hazell had been shown. Without a word the latter
walked to the door and locked it. Then he turned upon the man.</p>

<p>"Do you find ticket-collecting a paying business?" he asked.</p>

<p>The other turned very pale.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," he said.</p>

<p>"I can prove that you were amusing yourself asking for tickets
on the express from Redminster last night. I have all the
details."</p>

<p>The man was thoroughly taken aback. At first he denied
everything, but something in Hazell's quiet manner was too much for
him.</p>

<p>"Well," he said sullenly, "and if I was? It was a harmless
enough joke. You're from the railway company, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Hazell ignored the question.</p>

<p>"I want that diamond necklace that was handed to you by Miss
Mallaby's maid," he said, "sharp!"</p>

<p>The man gave a bound forward.</p>

<p>"It was a clever scheme you both hatched out at
Appledon&mdash;no!" he cried, "I know exactly what happened. If you
attempt any nonsense you're done for, my man." Then he went on to
explain that if the necklace were restored quietly nothing more
would be said.</p>

<p>"Not for your sake, you know," he added grimly, "but because
it's best to hush it up. If you refuse, I'll open the window and
tell my cabman to fetch the police. These are my conditions. You
give me the necklace, and clear out of here before your master
returns. For I fancy <i>he'll</i> know about this one of these
days."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" blurted out the man.</p>

<p>"My name's Thorpe Hazell&mdash;if that's any use to you, and
this isn't the first little affair of the railway I've solved."</p>

<p>"I've heard of you," said the valet. "Were you on the
train?"</p>

<p>"No. Now then&mdash;that necklace, please."</p>

<p>"I'll&mdash;I'll go and get it."</p>

<p>"Then I'll come with you."</p>

<p>He looked at Hazell for a moment, then, putting his hand in the
inner pocket of his coat he drew out a small case, and handed it
over to Hazell with a curse. The latter opened it, and saw the
diamonds were intact.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said. "I've two questions to ask you&mdash;out of
mere curiosity. Why did you trouble to ask for tickets in every
compartment of that carriage?"</p>

<p>"I thought it might allay suspicion if the alarm were given
before the end of the journey. The other passengers
would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is very weak!" interrupted Hazell. "How should you have
changed into uniform if there had been anyone else in your
compartment?"</p>

<p>"There was the lavatory."</p>

<p>"I see. Good-morning. You may think yourself very lucky, my
friend."</p>

<p>In an hour's time the necklace was in the hands of Miss St. John
Mallaby, who was profuse in her expressions of relief and
gratitude.</p>

<p>"And you are sure that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That Mr. Kestron had nothing to do with it? Absolutely. Now,
please ring for your maid."</p>

<p>The latter came in. Hazell held the necklace in his hands.</p>

<p>"Your mistress thinks you had better take yourself off at once,"
he said. "Mr. Kestron's valet is also out of a situation. Did you
use your scissors or a knife to slit open that dressing-case under
cover of the rug?"</p>

<p>She stood for half-a-minute gasping for breath. Then she left
the room without a word.</p>

<p>"It has been an interesting case, Miss Mallaby," remarked
Hazell, "and I am glad to think that the last of my little
investigations of railway mysteries has cleared a good man of
suspicion and ended happily."</p>

<h2>THE MYSTERY OF THE BOAT EXPRESS</h2>

<p>It was a gusty, stormy morning in January, with the wind blowing
a cold rain from the north-west. There were very few passengers by
the Great Southern Boat train to Porthampton that morning, for it
was not the day one would choose, if one could help it, for a
cross-Channel journey, especially as the telegram from the coast on
the station notice-board proclaimed that the Channel was "rough and
stormy."</p>

<p>It wanted but three minutes to the starting of the train. A
passenger came running from the booking office, a man of about
forty years of age, with fair beard and moustache, carrying a small
Gladstone bag, a soft hat pulled well down over his eyes, and the
collar of his great coat turned up.</p>

<p>"What class, sir?" asked the guard as he drew near.</p>

<p>"Second&mdash;please," replied the man.</p>

<p>The guard noticed that he spoke with a slight foreign accent,
and opened the door of an empty compartment. The passenger glanced
hurriedly along the train, and then got in.</p>

<p>"Will you please lock the door? I do not wish to be
disturbed."</p>

<p>The guard took the proffered half-crown, drew a key from his
pocket, and turned the lock. The man pulled up the window.</p>

<p>One or two more belated passengers came hurrying to the
train&mdash;one just as it was about to start. The latter looked
hastily into each carriage as he moved along the train.</p>

<p>"Now then, sir&mdash;in here, please!" And the guard opened the
door of a compartment, blew his whistle, and the train started.</p>

<p>At Porthampton the guard remembered the locked door, and ran
down the platform to release the passenger. He opened the door, and
gave a start of surprise.</p>

<p>The occupant of the compartment was huddled up in a heap upon
the floor on the further side, his head, with its back to the
guard, leaning against the edge of the seat. And staining the
cushion of the seat, and the man's shoulder, were splashes of
blood.</p>

<p>The guard gave a cry of alarm; a few station officials and
passengers pressed forward. One of the latter, an elderly
gentleman, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Then it was a shot I heard!"</p>

<p>"I'll trouble you for your name and address, then, please sir,"
said a quiet voice. "I am one of the company's detectives."</p>

<p>The other produced his card.</p>

<p>"I am the manager of the City and Southern Bank," he said.</p>

<p>"All right, sir&mdash;now let's have a look at the poor chap,
and you shall tell us your story later. Someone fetch a
doctor."</p>

<p>He went into the compartment, and gently raised the head of the
unfortunate man.</p>

<p>"He's dead, I'm afraid&mdash;looks as if he shot himself."</p>

<p>"There's a revolver on the seat," exclaimed the guard.</p>

<p>The detective took it up, glanced at it sharply, and put it into
his pocket.</p>

<p>"Was he travelling alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the guard.</p>

<p>"Anyone in the next compartments?"</p>

<p>"This is at the end of the coach. No one was in the next. I'm
certain of that."</p>

<p>A doctor came bustling up. They lifted the body on to the seat,
and the medical man made an examination.</p>

<p>"A bullet through the brain," he said. "Life must have been
extinct for nearly an hour."</p>

<p>"You say you heard a shot, sir?" asked the detective of the bank
manager.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;some time ago. I thought it was a fog signal. I
little imagined it meant suicide. Do you want me? I am on my way to
Paris, but I shall be back to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You could attend the inquest here if we held it to-morrow
evening?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>The whistle of the steamer sounded, and the little group of
passengers hurried away. The detective looked at the doctor,
raising his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Queer, I think, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>The doctor nodded.</p>

<p>"Half-a-minute," said the other.</p>

<p>He darted out of the carriage.</p>

<p>"Jenkins," he said to a subordinate on the platform, "it's lucky
you're here. I want you to board the boat and cross on her. Bring
back an account of all the passengers, if you can&mdash;there's not
a score of them."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>The detective went back to the carriage.</p>

<p>"I understand a revolver was found," said the doctor. "Where?"
The other showed the exact spot on the seat where the weapon had
been lying. Then he took it from his pocket and showed it to the
doctor. The latter examined it.</p>

<p>"As you say&mdash;it's queer," he said. "D'you see what he's got
in his right hand?"</p>

<p>The detective looked.</p>

<p>"A handkerchief!" he exclaimed. "Will you see about getting the
body to the waiting-room, sir? It may as well lie there. I'll
examine the clothes afterwards. I've some work to do here
first."</p>

<p>He was a long time in the compartment, and before he left he
summoned the guard once more. That night the evening papers had a
paragraph stating that an unknown man had apparently committed
suicide by shooting himself in the Porthampton boat express. The
detective smiled when he read it. His smile changed into a frown,
however, when Jenkins returned by the night boat and handed in his
report.</p>

<p>"Nothing suspicious about any of them," he said.</p>

<p>"Then he must have slipped off on this side&mdash;out of the
station," replied his chief enigmatically, "I've bungled it a
little."</p>

<p>At the inquest the guard was the first to give evidence. He
mentioned that the deceased had spoken to him with a German
accent.</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" asked the coroner.</p>

<p>"You can't be guard of the boat train for five years running,
sir, without picking up hints. I can generally spot a Frenchman or
a German."</p>

<p>He concluded by giving a brief account of his discovery of the
body. The coroner asked a few questions, adding:</p>

<p>"No one else could have got in with him?"</p>

<p>"Impossible, sir. The further door was locked already, and, as I
said, he asked for the other to be locked."</p>

<p>"He seemed to want to be alone?" asked a juryman.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The juryman nodded sagaciously.</p>

<p>"Suicide&mdash;premeditated," he murmured.</p>

<p>Mr. Clinton, the bank manager, was allowed to give evidence
next, as he was anxious to catch the last train back to town.</p>

<p>"I was travelling in the compartment next but two to the
deceased's," he said, "and was half dozing over a book when I heard
a slight report. The wind was very high and both windows were
shut."</p>

<p>"A report of a pistol?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think so at the time. There were three other
passengers with me, and we all imagined it was probably a detonator
on the line, such as is used in fogs or in warning the driver that
a gang of men are at work. I am interested in railway matters, and
I jumped up at once and looked out of both windows. There was
nothing to be seen, and the train did not slacken speed, so we all
thought no more about it till I was told at Porthampton what had
happened."</p>

<p>"When did you hear the shot?"</p>

<p>"About half an hour after leaving London."</p>

<p>Next came the doctor. He stated, concisely, that death had been
caused by a bullet which had entered the deceased's head at the
right temple, passed through the skull, and carried away a piece of
the bone on the further side. He agreed that the time which had
elapsed might reasonably coincide with the shot that Mr. Clinton
had heard, and described how he found the body lying on the floor
close to the further door.</p>

<p>"As a man might naturally have fallen after he had shot
himself?" asked the juryman who had spoken before.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," replied the doctor shortly.</p>

<p>A sensation ran round the court.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the coroner.</p>

<p>"There are circumstances in the case which are baffling. The
wound was just in the position likely for a man who had shot
himself with a pistol, holding it in his right hand with the muzzle
against his temple. Death must have been instantaneous. But the
strange thing is that the deceased was clutching a handkerchief
with his right hand, and that there were no powder marks round the
wound. The shot must have been fired at a further distance."</p>

<p>"But," said the coroner, "I understand that a revolver was found
in the compartment?"</p>

<p>"It was found before I was on the spot," replied the doctor,
"and the next witness will tell you more about it. It is not my
professional business," he went on, "to hazard speculation; but I
do say emphatically that, in my opinion, it is certainly not a case
of suicide."</p>

<p>The detective corroborated what the doctor had said.</p>

<p>"Tell us about the revolver, please," said the coroner. "It was
lying on the seat&mdash;away from the deceased. It was loaded in
every chamber, and had not been discharged recently. The barrel was
quite clean inside.</p>

<p>"I examined the compartment carefully," he went on, "and
although, as the doctor has told you, the bullet went through the
skull, carrying away a piece of the bone, I could find neither bone
nor bullet&mdash;nor any mark of either&mdash;in the carriage."</p>

<p>"Was the window open?" asked a juryman.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;at the end where the body had fallen. The other was
shut. I know what your question implies; but, if the man had been
shot by someone outside the open window, the bullet mark would have
been found at the opposite end of the compartment. If, on the other
hand, the bullet, after penetrating the skull, had gone out of the
open window, the shot must have been fired inside, which appears
impossible, especially as both doors were found locked; and the
murderer could not have opened the other window from outside and
then fired through it."</p>

<p>"What is your opinion, then?" asked the Coroner.</p>

<p>"Murder," he replied, "but how I cannot say."</p>

<p>"You have taken steps?"</p>

<p>"As far as is possible."</p>

<p>He stated further that there was no clue to identify the dead
man. "He carried no papers, his bag only contained clothing, and
his linen was not marked."</p>

<p>"Nothing else?"</p>

<p>The witness hesitated.</p>

<p>"There was something which might be a possible clue, sir; but I
will ask you not to make me mention it&mdash;at present."</p>

<p>An adjournment was made for a fortnight at the request of the
police. But at the adjournment the detective said bluntly that he
had no more evidence, and the inspector of police who was in charge
of the case was equally reticent.</p>

<p>Finally, the jury returned the rather strange verdict of "Found
shot&mdash;apparently by some person unknown," and the newspapers
curtly referred to the case as "another unsolved railway
mystery."<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>So much for the story. I had the sequel from the very man who
unravelled the mystery, now retired from business on a comfortable
pension. He was telling me some of his exploits one day, when I
happened to mention the Porthampton Murder.</p>

<p>"That was a curious affair," I said. "You never solved it, did
you?"</p>

<p>He filled and lit his pipe thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I can't say I didn't do that," he replied; "but"&mdash;and he
laughed&mdash;"I wasn't allowed to get the credit of it. The
official police stopped me. Look here," he went on, "it happened
five years ago, and is forgotten; I don't mind telling you the
tale, if you like."</p>

<p>"I'd better begin at the start," he continued. "I was pretty
convinced from the first that the murderer&mdash;if there were
one&mdash;had been on the train, and probably given us the slip at
Porthampton Station. But I had very little to go upon. As a sort of
forlorn hope, however, it dawned upon me that something might be
discovered if I found the exact spot on the line where the bank
manager&mdash;Mr. Clinton&mdash;had heard the shot. He had said it
was about half an hour after leaving London. I ran up to town the
morning after the inquest, and called on him.</p>

<p>"'Can't you recollect exactly where it was on the line?' I
asked.</p>

<p>"He thought for a minute.</p>

<p>"'Let me see&mdash;yes, I can. We ran through Hazleton Station a
minute or so afterwards.'</p>

<p>"'Hazleton;' I exclaimed. 'A big village, I think? Now, Mr.
Clinton, when you looked out, you're sure you saw no one&mdash;on
the footboard, for example?'</p>

<p>"'Positive. I couldn't have helped seeing anyone if he had been
there. I glanced both up and down the track on both sides.'</p>

<p>"I took the next train to Hazleton, determined to patrol the
line for a mile or so up from the station. It was just a remote
possibility that I might find something&mdash;perhaps, even, a
pistol!</p>

<p>"It was a fruitless search, however. So, giving it up, I made up
my mind to seek a place of refreshment. A road ran parallel with
the up side of the line, quite close. I climbed over the palings
for easier walking, and got into the road. There were a few small
houses, almost new, of the suburban villa type, for Hazleton was
getting a name as a picturesque neighbourhood, being only
half-an-hour's run from town.</p>

<p>"As I walked along, thinking that the train must have been
passing close by the spot when the mysterious tragedy happened, my
glance fell on the gatepost of one of the villas. On it was the
name of the house, 'The Maples.'</p>

<p>"I gave a start, and I'll tell you why. You may remember that at
the inquest I stated there was a small, possible clue, which I
wished to keep to myself. In the pocket of the murdered man I had
found a current number of a newspaper, on the outside cover of
which was scrawled in pencil those very words&mdash;'The
Maples.'</p>

<p>"At once I made up my mind. I found my way to the only newspaper
shop in the village, and made some inquiries. At what hour could I
have a morning paper delivered? I was told the newspaper train
arrived pretty early, and that the boy started on his rounds at
seven. I chatted away, leading the conversation up to 'The Maples.'
Yes, they sent papers to that house.</p>

<p>"'Who lives there?' I asked casually.</p>

<p>"'Foreigners, I think, sir. They haven't been long at Hazleton.
I've quite forgotten their name for the moment.'</p>

<p>"I was evidently on a track. Sometimes boldness is the best
action for discovering things, so I determined to call at 'The
Maples.' The point was this: The paper found on the man had
evidently been left at this house the very morning he was murdered.
The obvious deduction was that the poor wretch himself had been in
the house.</p>

<p>"The door was opened by a fair-haired young woman, with a pale,
anxious face. I saw, at a glance, she had been crying.</p>

<p>"'What is it, please, you want?' she asked nervously, with a
strong foreign accent.</p>

<p>"I came to the point at once.</p>

<p>"'Information about a fellow-countryman of yours who left this
house early on Tuesday morning and was found dead in the
Porthampton boat express,' I said.</p>

<p>"She clasped her hands together, and gave a little cry.</p>

<p>"'<i>Ach!</i>' she exclaimed, 'are you of the <i>English</i>
police?'</p>

<p>"'Not exactly,' I replied, 'I am in the service of the railway
company.'</p>

<p>"She hesitated. I thought she was about to faint. Then, pulling
herself together with an effort, she said:</p>

<p>"'Will you come in? You need not fear&mdash;there is no one else
in the house.'</p>

<p>"She led me into a sitting-room, sat down, wringing her hands,
and said, in a low voice:</p>

<p>"'He was my brother!'</p>

<p>"'Your brother? But if you knew&mdash;why have you not
identified him?'</p>

<p>"She shook her head.</p>

<p>"'I was afraid&mdash;they might kill me,
too&mdash;<i>Himmel</i>&mdash;but you do not know how I am
suffering.'</p>

<p>"'Then you know he was murdered?' I asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"She nodded.</p>

<p>"'I saw it,' she gasped, 'it has haunted me ever since&mdash;it
was terrible&mdash;and I could do nothing. Poor Andr!'</p>

<p>"'Come,' I said, 'you must tell me everything. I want to be your
friend.'</p>

<p>"'But&mdash;but,' she faltered, 'it is the police whom I
fear&mdash;and the others. You do not know.'</p>

<p>"My dear young lady,' I said, 'I assure you you have nothing to
fear from the police. They are only too anxious to find the
murderer. And, if you know, you can help them.'</p>

<p>"She shook her head again.</p>

<p>"'You do not understand,' she said. There was a long pause. Then
she spoke again, more calmly:</p>

<p>"'I will tell you,' she said. 'Since you have discovered so
much. I was afraid of this. My name is Cambon. Andr and I are
natives of Alsace, of French extraction, but of German nationality.
And, you see, we were both in the Secret Service of the German
Government. I cannot tell you how it all happened, but Herr Otto
Schuster had us in his hands&mdash;he is a bad man. It began by
accident; a little sketch that I made of one of your English forts,
and Andr mentioned it. Schuster paid us for it; we were poor, and
ever since he has held us in his hand.'</p>

<p>"'There is a retired officer of your artillery living here in
Hazleton, Major Dent. He had invented a new gun, and your War
Office was going to make experiments with it. Schuster told us we
must come down here and try and get the drawings, so he took this
house for us. We got to know the Major&mdash;I taught his little
girl German, and&mdash;well I got hold of the plans and made a
rough copy.'</p>

<p>"'And sold it to Schuster?'</p>

<p>"'No. That is why it all happened. It was Pierre Duprez who
interfered. You do not know him? Oh, he is one of the cleverest
spies of the French Government, and he found out what we were
doing. He came here and saw my brother, just as we were about to
send the plans to Schuster. He appealed to Andre's French
parentage&mdash;he entreated&mdash;reviled him for being a false
Alsatian&mdash;for many of us still hate the Germans, though we
obey them. And Andr gave way. He gave the plans to Pierre Duprez,
and Duprez was to pay him twenty thousand francs&mdash;to his order
at a bank in Paris. We meant to retire then&mdash;to get away from
the power of Otto Schuster. That was last Monday, and Duprez took
the plans back with him to London.</p>

<p>"'It was early on Tuesday morning that the warning came, by the
first post. Pierre Duprez sent it. He said that Schuster had found
out, and advised my brother to go to Paris at once. There was
scarcely time to arrange anything, for Andr saw that he must take
the next train to town to catch the boat express. I packed up a few
things in his bag, and he put in his revolver. He was very nervous
and afraid of Schuster, and said he should keep the weapon ready
during the whole journey. I was to follow him in a few days' time.
Then we arranged a signal, so that I should know he had caught the
express. He was to wave his handkerchief from the window as the
train passed this house.</p>

<p>"'Can you guess now? Schuster must have tracked him to the
train, but was too late to get in with him. I stood just outside
the front door, waiting. Then the train came in sight, and I saw
Andr leaning out of the window, waving his handkerchief. I waved
mine in return. Schuster must have seen me doing so, and that
evidently gave him the idea that Andr was leaning out of the
carriage, and that an unexpected chance of killing him had offered
itself.</p>

<p>"'For, suddenly, just as the train was opposite the house, I saw
a man's head and arm come out of a window two compartments behind
my brother. Something shone in his hand; he leant forward, took aim
at Andr, there was a flash, and I saw my brother fall back into
the carriage, while Schuster, for it was near enough to recognise
him, immediately retired into his.'</p>

<p>"Now I understood why no traces of bone or bullet were found.
The latter went through Cambon's head while it was outside the
carriage.</p>

<p>"Well, by strong arguments, I prevailed upon his sister to go to
town with me at once. Now she had told her story a new idea seemed
to have got possession of her. The phase of fright was passing.
Vengeance was taking its place.</p>

<p>"'Yes, I will go with you,' she said, 'I don't care what your
police do with me&mdash;if they find Otto Schuster.'</p>

<p>"But I had my doubts and said nothing. It was as I had expected.
The Chief Inspector at Scotland Yard took down the information
without comment, thought for a few minutes, and then said:</p>

<p>"'I will ask you to stay here a short time, I am going to the
Foreign Office. This is a very peculiar matter, and I cannot handle
it without advice.'</p>

<p>"In an hour's time he was back. A grim smile was on his face. He
turned to Frulein Cambon.</p>

<p>"'It may be some satisfaction to you to know that any charge
against you for purloining valuable secrets has fallen through.
Major Dent is not so artless as you supposed. His drawings were
under lock and key at the War Office.'</p>

<p>"But&mdash;!' she began, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"'What you copied were old designs, of no value,' he interrupted
drily, 'as M. Duprez will doubtless discover before long.'</p>

<p>"She sprang from her seat.</p>

<p>"'So!' she cried, 'Andr has been murdered for nothing! But you
will find this Schuster&mdash;ah, you English police are so clever!
You will hang him, yes&mdash;'</p>

<p>"The Chief waved his hand.</p>

<p>"'Madam,' he said, 'my instructions are simply to see that you
leave the country at once. With the rest we have nothing to do.
When one enters the Secret Service of a Government one takes all
risks, and you and your brother ought to have known this. You will
understand,' he went on, turning to me, 'that nothing is to be done
by us, and that you are to proceed no further.'</p>

<p>"'You will not find Schuster. You will not avenge my poor
brother?' she shrieked.</p>

<p>"He shook his head.</p>

<p>"'Then,' she said, in a low voice, 'I will avenge Andr myself.
I will never rest until&mdash;'</p>

<p>"The Chief cut her short. He evidently had little sympathy with
spies.</p>

<p>"'You may do what you please, madam, but I warn you that it must
not be in this country.'</p>

<p>"Whether she carried out her threat or not I often wonder. At
all events Otto Schuster, the German Secret Service agent, was
found stabbed in the back in one of the narrow streets of Genoa not
a year afterwards, and I have sometimes thought it may have been
the sequel to the Porthampton boat express mystery."</p>

<h2>HOW THE EXPRESS WAS SAVED</h2>

<p>The strike on the Mid-Northern Railway was not very prominent in
the public eye. The daily papers, full of a murder sensation, had
devoted only small paragraphs to it&mdash;paragraphs which had been
relentlessly slaughtered with blue pencil before they left the
sub-editors' room. Passengers on the railway noticed nothing at
all. Trains still ran fairly up to the scheduled time, guards and
porters took tips as usual. Nothing seemed amiss to the casual
eye.</p>

<p>The reason was that only one section of the great army of
workers of the Mid-Northern Railway had laid down their arms, or
rather their tools, and these particular tools were shovels and
pickaxes, and crowbars and spanners. It was a platelayers'
strike&mdash;based on a shilling a week extra and an obdurate board
of directors.</p>

<p>In this particular instance the officials considered the strike
was unjustified, a breach of certain contracts made in a recent
conciliation, and they had taken the strong line of not only
refusing to discuss the men's demands, but also of giving it out
that certain of the ringleaders need not trouble to return to work
at all. The strike was by no means general; a certain proportion of
employees remained on duty, and no trouble had been encountered in
obtaining the services of a few hundreds of "out of works."</p>

<p>A dozen men were gathered together in the stuffy little bar of
the "Red Lion" at Hillingdon. At all times you would have expected
the railway element to predominate in that particular bar, for
Hillingdon was a big junction on the Mid-Northern and the "Red
Lion" stood in the very centre of a district, nine-tenths of the
inhabitants of which were employed in the Company's service.</p>

<p>The subject of discussion was, naturally, the platelayers'
strike.</p>

<p>"Well, there ain't much wrong with the road," remarked the
fireman of a goods engine. "Everything up to time. You wouldn't
know anything was up at all."</p>

<p>"It's those blacklegs that are upsetting things," replied a
thickset man with a scowling face who lounged in a corner. "If it
wasn't for them takin' on our job you wouldn't ha' had such an easy
run down."</p>

<p>The fireman laughed. He was young and cheeky.</p>

<p>"They'll want someone to take on your job for good and all,
Yates," he said, "from what I hear."</p>

<p>Joe Yates darted an angry look at him and replied with an oath.
He was one of the men whom the Company had refused to take back, he
and another named Ford being the ringleaders of discontent at
Hillingdon.</p>

<p>"Steady on, Tom," growled one of the men to the fireman, "your
tongue's too loose, my lad."</p>

<p>"Got many chaps at work up the line?" asked another
platelayer.</p>

<p>The fireman nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a lot. You haven't even stopped 'em putting down the
new rails 't'other side o' Cranbury. There's a good forty of 'em
there&mdash;hard at it."</p>

<p>"Ought to be shot," muttered Joe Yates, "what business have they
to take the bread out o' the mouths o' us, eh?"</p>

<p>The fireman drained his glass, and replaced it on the
counter.</p>

<p>"Might as well ask what business have you chaps to take the
bread out o' the mouths o' your wives and children," he answered as
he went to the door.</p>

<p>With another oath Joe Yates sprang forward. A few hands were
stretched out to stop him, but he had almost gained the door when a
newcomer entered and barred the way&mdash;a tall, sinewy man in
corduroys.</p>

<p>"Chuck it, Joe," he exclaimed. "If it's that young fool of a
Stimson you're after he ain't worth wastin' muscle on. Come and
have a drink with me."</p>

<p>It was Harry Ford himself. By mutual consent the others dropped
the subject of the strike while the two men drank sullenly and in
silence. Presently Ford said to the other:</p>

<p>"Coming out?"</p>

<p>"Don't mind if I do."</p>

<p>"Come on then. Good-night, all."</p>

<p>It was raining steadily, and very dark. The two men walked
slowly along the street, and then Ford led the way to a waste,
unfrequented bit of ground.</p>

<p>"Look here," he remarked suddenly, "it's not much of a lookout
for you and me, is it Joe?"</p>

<p>"That it ain't&mdash;curse 'em!" replied the other.</p>

<p>"Curse 'em by all means, but that won't do 'em no harm. Ain't
you game for something more?"</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean, Harry?"</p>

<p>"I heard a bit o' news just now. The G.M.s* coming down to
Hillingdon to-night&mdash;by the express that gets here at
11.53."</p>

<p>[* General Manager.]</p>

<p>"Well, what o' that?"</p>

<p>Ford's voice sank to a low whisper.</p>

<p>"Well, supposing that train was to run off the metals just afore
it got to Buckley Bridge."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"I say, supposing a length o' rail was taken out just t'other
side o' the bridge&mdash;chance for the whole train and the G.M. in
it to pitch into the river, eh?"</p>

<p>"What are you driving at, Harry?" asked Joe Yates, sinking his
voice to a whisper.</p>

<p>"A spanner and a hammer 'ud soon do it," replied the other, "and
the night's made for it."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;if we were seen?"</p>

<p>"Look here, Joe. How far off is Buckley Bridge?"</p>

<p>"Matter o' four miles up the line."</p>

<p>"Then if we were seen here in Hillingdon at a quarter to eleven
no one 'ud even suspect us o' the job, eh?"</p>

<p>"But how would we get there in time?"</p>

<p>"The 10.55 goods to Wharnton. Leaves No. 5 siding. We could
easily get into a truck. And she has to slow down at Buckley signal
box to get the staff for the Wharnton branch. We could drop off
there and be right on the job. Are you game for it?"</p>

<p>"Done!"</p>

<p>"Right. You show yourself in the 'Red Lion' later on; I'll go to
some other pub. Meet me alongside the goods just before 10.55.
She'll be marshalled ready for starting. And bring a spanner. I'll
get hold of a crow-bar."<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Buckley Bridge, or "Bridge No. 74," as it was technically
called, was an iron bridge, of some fifty yards in length, spanning
the river, some four miles away from Hillingdon on the up line. It
was used for the service of trains only, and was guarded by a light
iron railing on either side.</p>

<p>A little way on the Hillingdon side of the bridge stood a signal
box. This box guarded the junction where the single branch line to
Wharnton struck off from the main line. The customary signals were
placed to protect this junction, of which two only need be
described in the present narrative. These were the "distant" and
the "home" signals which warned approaching trains on the down main
line, and they were both on the side of the bridge farthest away
from the signal box.</p>

<p>The "distant" signal was half-a-mile up the line, the "home"
signal about a hundred yards before the bridge. There was,
therefore, ample protection for the down trains, as if the junction
or the block beyond it on the Hillingdon side were not clear the
train would be brought to a stop well before it reached the
bridge.</p>

<p>Beyond the bridge, where the main line ran on to the signal box,
it curved slightly to the right, so that the man on duty could not
actually see the down home signal. But, by means of that wonderful
little instrument, the electric repeater, he could tell its
position exactly, the miniature semaphore arm in the little glass
case in front of him imitating every movement of the signal itself
as he pulled or replaced the lever.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1300071h-images/p180.jpg" width=
"1000" border="1">
</p>

<p>In the signal box were two men, the signalman on duty and a
young linesman. It was the duty of the latter to patrol a certain
length of the road with a view to inspecting and repairing electric
and signalling apparatus. Some trifling defect had been found that
evening in the interlocking gear beneath the Buckley box, and
Charles Palmer had been working at it overtime. He had now come up
from the network of bars and wires below the box, and was smoking
his pipe in the cabin.</p>

<p>He was packing up his tools as he smoked. One or two, such as
his folding rule and a small pair of wire cutters, he put in his
pocket from force of habit. The rest he arranged in his bag.</p>

<p>A ring came at the bell.</p>

<p>"The Wharnton Goods," said the signalman, as he returned the
answer and pulled the levers that "took off" the up main home and
distant signals.</p>

<p>"You'll be wanting the staff for her," said Palmer.</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>He went up to the curious-looking electric machine that held the
staves for the Wharnton Branch, signalled forward to the block
ahead on the single line, obtained, by means of electric release, a
long brass staff from the machine, and then threw open his window
and peered down the line. Two flickering lights, a green above a
white, showed that the goods train was approaching. The engine came
to a standstill just beside the box, and the signalman ran down the
steps and handed the staff to the driver.</p>

<p>"A rough night, Bill."</p>

<p>"No mistake," replied the driver, as he opened the throttle
valve. "Good-night, mate!"</p>

<p>Out of a low truck midway along the goods train Yates and Ford
dropped stealthily to the ground on the side farther from the
signal box, climbed the fence bordering the line, and, stooping
down, hurried along parallel with the track through fields until
they came to the bank of the river. Here they turned aside,
reclimbed the fence, and passed over the iron bridge.</p>

<p>"Got your spanner, Joe?" asked Ford, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"There's not too much time&mdash;we shall have to look
sharp."</p>

<p>"Can't start till the local's gone by."</p>

<p>"Ah, I forgot that. Hullo&mdash;there's the signal for her."</p>

<p>"Crash!" went the arm of the down home signal which stood about
a hundred yards beyond them. The two men hid themselves as the
local train came by, and then sprang on to the track.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1300071h-images/p181.jpg" width=
"300" border="1">
</p>

<p>"Here you are," said Ford, "we'll soon have it out. I only
helped to put it in three weeks ago," he added, with a grim
chuckle. "You take that end, I'll tackle this."</p>

<p>Rails are secured to each other at the ends by flat pieces of
metal known as "fish plates," to which they are fixed by bolts. The
object of the two men was to remove one of the rails immediately in
front of the bridge, rightly calculating that if the engine ran off
at that point the train would probably be wrecked in the river.</p>

<p>It was work to which they were well accustomed, and accustomed
to do it smartly as well. As a rule old rails are replaced by new
ones without in any way interfering with the running of the trains,
and over and over again the passenger little dreams as he runs
along securely that a new rail was inserted only a few minutes
before.</p>

<p>With their stout, curved spanners, they loosened and unscrewed
the nuts which fastened the bolts holding the two fish plates to
the rails. In a very short time the fish plates themselves were off
and lying alongside the line. Then came the knocking out of the
wooden "keys" which held the rail in the "chairs" fixed down to the
sleepers. They looked round once or twice, for they could not
loosen the keys without a slight noise of hammering, but the wind
was rising, drowning all sounds. Then the rail lay loose.</p>

<p>Next came the supreme effort. Long rails weighing 106 lb. to the
yard take some moving. Both men were strong, but it wanted all
their strength put forth before the rail was lifted out of the
chairs and fell with a muffled clang at the side of the line.</p>

<p>Then the unexpected happened. Charles Palmer had started for his
home, and his home was in a village the further side of the river
from the signal box. There was a road bridge two miles away; there
was the convenient railway bridge close at hand. And he, naturally,
chose the nearer route. The sky was clearing a little, a waning
moon had risen and was showing a pale light through the
rain-clouds. Half-way over the bridge he fancied he saw something
moving; just as he was over there came the clang of the metal, and
when Yates and Ford looked up he was there&mdash;right upon
them&mdash;with his fists clenched.</p>

<p>"You scoundrels!" he cried, as he rushed forward.</p>

<p>Ford, however, was perfectly cool. His brawny arm went out
straight from the shoulder, and his fist caught Palmer right on the
chin. The young man went down like a log.</p>

<p>"Curse him!" cried Ford beneath his breath, "look sharp, Yates.
There's no time to lose. Got any cord or anything?"</p>

<p>"Here's a bit o' stout twine."</p>

<p>"Tie his legs together&mdash;ah, would you!" he exclaimed as
Palmer made an attempt to cry out. "I'll stuff something in his
mouth and tie it in with a handkerchief&mdash;we must fix his arms,
too. I know&mdash;good, he's got leather laces in his
boots&mdash;that's better than cord."</p>

<p>In five minutes Charles Palmer lay beside the line gagged, his
feet tied together and his hands cruelly fastened behind him with
his own bootlaces, while Ford and Yates had gained the further side
of the river and were hurrying back to Hillingdon along
unfrequented by-roads.</p>

<p>They paused once for breath.</p>

<p>"He'll be smashed up," whispered Yates, thinking of Palmer.</p>

<p>"Let him be!" replied the other savagely, "if he isn't we'll
have to make tracks&mdash;for I believe he recognised us."<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Charles Palmer lay for a few minutes half dazed. Then he began
to realise not only his own terrible position, but the fact of the
gaping void between the line of rail. Nothing could save the
express from being wrecked. It was, he knew almost due now.</p>

<p>"Twang&mdash;crash!" the sounds came simultaneously. The down
home signal was pulled off. He glanced at the place where the post
should be. Yes&mdash;the extinguishing disc had passed over the
white "back light," so that green showed on the other side.</p>

<p>"Twang!" That was for the distant signal. The train was on the
block now, and the line was signalled "clear."</p>

<p>And then a desperate thought, arising from a pain in his thigh,
came into his mind. If only he could do it! Writhing and twisting
he wriggled himself slowly away from the metals to the side of the
line. His face touched something cold. Good! It was what he was
seeking for&mdash;the wire that communicated with the home
signal.</p>

<p>A great effort, and he lay with his back to the wire. Could he
do it? With extreme difficulty and with the laces cutting into his
flesh he managed to get a couple of fingers into his hip pocket,
felt for the cutters, drew them slowly out, held them in his hand,
and groped for the wire behind him.</p>

<p>The weighted safety lever at the base of the home signal,
relieved of the tension of the wire, fell, resetting the semaphore
arm at "danger," and showing the red light.</p>

<p>A whistle, the grinding of brakes, a shower of sparks along the
wheels, and the great express came to a standstill.</p>

<p>What was up? In the signal box the man knew something had given
way. The tell-tale repeater stood at "line blocked." The engine
whistle clamoured for a clear road. The road was clear. Seizing a
lantern he came down from the signal box and ran along the line,
past the curve, till he could see the back light.</p>

<p>He waved the lantern for the train to advance slowly, running
forward over the bridge as he did so.</p>

<p>Then, with a shout, he turned on the red glass of his lantern
and waved it frantically. He had seen the gap in the
metals&mdash;and the man beside the line. The train was saved!</p>

<p>And to-day Charles Palmer holds a prominent position in the
electrical and engineering department of the Mid-Northern.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>A CASE OF SIGNALLING</h2>

<p>The 2.15 goods train moved slowly out of No. 14 siding at the
big terminal station of Sterrington on the Great Southern Railway,
and commenced its ponderous journey on the main up line. To railway
men the train was ironically known as the "afternoon flier," a name
given to it in scorn and derision. All the way along the line it
stopped at every station to pick up empties, and was shunted into
every refuge siding in between stations to make way for its
betters.</p>

<p>Finally, it accomplished the seventy or eighty odd miles of its
journey in something under seven hours, more or less. It was
rumoured that at more than one point the brakesman had his regular
nap while the driver and fireman comfortably read stray newspapers
in their cab.</p>

<p>Along the route they were subjected to mild chaff from porters
on platforms or signalmen who hauled them up. "Broken the record
today, Jim?" "Been racing a funeral?" "What sort o' weather did you
leave at Sterrington last week?" These, and similar observations,
broke upon the ear of old Jim Harvey, but without the slightest
impression.</p>

<p>On the return journey at night he made up for it. He backed his
engine on to a "fast mineral" train that came pounding down at
twenty or thirty miles an hour, with only three stops to take off
loaded trucks until she was held up in Fairdale refuge siding three
miles out of Sterrington for fifteen or twenty minutes, to allow of
the passing of the night passenger down express.</p>

<p>Jim Harvey stood on the footplate of his dingy, but powerful
goods engine, "notching her up" slightly as she took the road and
gained in speed, his eyes fixed on the signals in the distance. His
grey head turned occasionally to observe the manner in which George
Ledbury, his young fireman, put on coal&mdash;a task calling for
the exercise of more skill than the outsider is aware of.</p>

<p>George Ledbury was a new mate, having only recently been
promoted from the footplate of an insignificant "local goods" to
work on the main line. He had great visions of the day when he
should drive a crack express train like the one that came snorting
past them on the down road.</p>

<p>"That'll do," said the driver with a grunt of approbation; "she
won't want any more before she gets to the Belton rise."</p>

<p>The fireman put down his short shovel, gave the footplate a
brush round, wiped his hands on a bit of waste, and took his place
on the other side of the cab. He was a good-looking young man, in
spite of the fact that at this particular moment he had a big
smudge on one of his cheeks. He gave one the idea of being quick
and alert, and there was a twinkle in his blue eyes that spoke of
happiness.</p>

<p>They were passing through the suburbs of the large town of
Sterrington now, and the streets of small houses had given place to
broad avenues with large villas of a superior class. This suburb of
Fairdale was noted for its quiet and beauty. Many of the wealthy
manufacturers and business men had their houses there, together
with a sprinkling of the "retired."</p>

<p>The country began to open out, and fields appeared. About three
hundred yards from the line were some half-a-dozen good-sized
detached houses standing in their own grounds with their backs to
the railway&mdash;almost the last houses of the suburb. The
fireman's gaze shifted from the signals ahead to one of these
houses; he drew a clean-white handkerchief from his pocket, and,
turning his back to the driver, suddenly began waving it to and fro
with peculiar motion.</p>

<p>Jim Harvey, glancing over his shoulder across the cab, suddenly
caught sight of these mysterious movements. He was about to speak,
when, looking beyond over the field, he saw something else which
brought a grin over his weather-beaten face.</p>

<p>Standing at an open window at the back of one of the aforesaid
houses a female figure in a white apron could just be discerned,
and there came the answering waving of a handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Is she a pretty girl, George?"</p>

<p>George Ledbury turned round, stuffed the handkerchief into his
pocket, and the smudge on his face showed upon a crimson
background.</p>

<p>"Ask me to the wedding when it comes off, won't you, mate?"</p>

<p>George laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, "there's nothing to be ashamed of."</p>

<p>"Not a bit, my lad," replied the old driver cheerily. "I've been
through it myself and I wish you luck. Got a place over there?"</p>

<p>And he jerked his thumb in the direction of the house.</p>

<p>"Yes. She's a parlourmaid to a fussy old retired major and his
wife."</p>

<p>"You were waving your handkerchief in a funny way&mdash;and so
was she," went on the driver.</p>

<p>"Morse code," replied the fireman.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Before I was in the sheds, I was in a signal-box for a year and
learnt the code. I've been teaching it to Maggie."</p>

<p>"Oho!" exclaimed Jim Harvey, "signalling, eh? What was it you
said?"</p>

<p>The young man blushed crimson again and looked
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"<i>Best love</i>," he blurted out.</p>

<p>The other laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"And what did she say?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;something&mdash;something about a kiss&mdash;only she
didn't spell it quite right. She hasn't quite got hold of the code
yet."</p>

<p>"Well I'm blowed!" said the driver. "Hullo&mdash;bit o' stick
against us. Brakes, George!"</p>

<p>A "bit o' stick" in the shape of a semaphore arm at right angles
to the post faced them. The driver shut off steam, the fireman
screwed down the hand brake.</p>

<p>George Ledbury had each second Sunday off. Maggie Bond's
alternate Sunday afternoon out, strangely enough, coincided with
it. Therefore it came to pass that the following Sunday they might
have been seen in the country outside Fairdale walking arm in arm.
Only, instead of his dirty dungaree overalls, George wore a
well-fitting dark blue serge suit, had a face that was clean enough
for the occasional kiss he got in return for a dozen given, and
looked, in every way, an exceedingly spruce young man. The
conversation need not be recorded, being of the "As it was and ever
shall be, world without end" description.</p>

<p>"What's the time, George?" Maggie asked presently.</p>

<p>"Five forty-seven," he replied, in true railway parlance, after
glancing at his watch.</p>

<p>"That's ten minutes to six," she exclaimed, with a woman's usual
comprehension of exact figures, "and if I'm not back by six
there'll be an awful row. The master is just about irritable if
you're not back exactly in time."</p>

<p>"Bother the master," replied George, "we'd best be getting back,
then."</p>

<p>It struck six before they reached the house. Outside the gate he
demanded a farewell kiss, got it, and gave three in exchange, the
entire performance being observed, unknown to the actors therein,
by Major Blake, who was strolling round his garden.</p>

<p>Off went George Ledbury, walking with head erect and heart aglow
down Sinclair Avenue&mdash;the name of the quiet little
street&mdash;and in through the gate went Maggie, to be confronted
by the stern little Major.</p>

<p>"Margaret, you're ten minutes late."</p>

<p>"Very sorry, sir."</p>

<p>"Who was that young man you were kissing?"</p>

<p>Maggie blushed violently.</p>

<p>"He's&mdash;he's a friend, sir."</p>

<p>"Margaret, I'm ashamed of you."</p>

<p>She drew herself up a little.</p>

<p>"We're engaged to be married, sir," she said a trifle
defiantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, are you! Why, you're not out of your teens. Understand me,
Margaret, that I won't have any followers about my house. I object
to it. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"A fireman on the railway, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh! One of those fellows who are always going on strike; a lazy
lot. You'd better have nothing more to do with him. Anyhow, don't
let me catch him about my house. Go indoors at once. Your mistress
wants you."</p>

<p>He spoke as one addressing a private in a regiment, and started
for a walk, very satisfied with himself. He did not notice two
well-dressed men who were strolling along Sinclair Avenue, although
they, apparently, eyed him with interest. He might have seen one of
them the next day talking casually to his gardener at the dinner
hour, and eliciting certain information about himself.</p>

<p>He returned from his walk and found his wife in the
drawing-room. She was a weak little woman. But then she had been
married five-and-twenty years to Major Blake.</p>

<p>"I've had to give Margaret a lecture, my dear," he began. "The
girl has a sweetheart."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," she replied, "Margaret has just given me a month's
notice."</p>

<p>Major Blake's periodical "lectures" to the domestics meant a
constant source of worry to Mrs. Blake and an increase of fees to
the local registry office for servants.</p>

<p>"Impudent hussy!" exclaimed the Major, "we're well rid of
her."</p>

<p>His wife sighed.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry she's going, dear. She's been a very good
servant&mdash;and they are not easy to get."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" rejoined the Major. "I won't have men coming about my
house. I'd rather be without servants altogether. I don't want to
be robbed."</p>

<p>Later on that evening he smoked his cigar and sipped his whiskey
and water in a little room he called his "study," but which was not
blessed with many books. In one corner was a large iron safe. The
Major was a collector, and a collector with expensive tastes. That
safe contained a variety of precious stones, chiefly uncut.</p>

<p>He opened it, glancing with a collector's pride at the contents,
which were arranged in various trays. It was his silver wedding day
soon, and he was going to give his wife a necklace made from uncut
Indian sapphires. He picked out about a dozen of the pale blue
stones.</p>

<p>"These will do very well," he said to himself, "I can take them
up to town with me when we go on Tuesday. By the way, I must go and
talk over trains with Kate."</p>

<p>It was on the following Tuesday afternoon that Major Blake and
his wife went to London. He had a parting shot at Maggie Bond as he
was going out of the house.</p>

<p>"Now, Margaret," he said, "remember what I told you. I won't
have that young fellow about my premises while I'm away."</p>

<p>The little servant tossed her head. She was not over particular
in her reply.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir. I'll leave myself now if you don't
think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Margaret," broke in Mrs. Blake. "We shall be back
Thursday morning. See that the fire is lighted in your master's
study."</p>

<p>So it came to pass that Maggie was left alone with the cook. The
latter was slightly deaf and fond of reading penny novelettes, so
Maggie was left much to her own resources. She waved her
handkerchief as usual to George Ledbury as his train passed on the
Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock that evening she accompanied the cook, who was a
trifle nervous, round the house to lock up. Then both servants went
to bed, the cook sleeping in an attic in front of the house and
Maggie occupying a similar room at the back.</p>

<p>It was about one a.m., and unusually dark, when two men came
stealthily down Sinclair Avenue, each of them carrying a large
black bag. Arrived at Major Blake's house they entered the gate,
crossed the lawn on tip-toe, and proceeded to a window at the side
of the building.</p>

<p>Then, with the help of a glazier's diamond and a circular bit of
leather soaked in water, they quickly and skilfully removed half a
pane of glass. The rest was easy, and in five minutes' time they
were bending over the safe in the Major's study on the second
floor, examining it with a small electric lantern.</p>

<p>"A good two hours' work," whispered one of them.</p>

<p>"Let's get at it, then. Out with the tools."</p>

<p>It may be that they made a slight noise in opening their bags
and arranging their tools. At any rate, Maggie awoke with a start
and listened attentively. She was by no means a nervous girl, and,
somehow, the fear or even the thought of burglars never entered her
head. What was really agitating her mind was the problem as to
whether she had shut the window in her master's study. She
remembered opening it in the morning, but she could not recollect
whether she had closed it with the other windows in the afternoon.
A slight wind was rising. She got out of bed, opened the door, and
listened.</p>

<p>A gentle "swishing" sound came from below, just such a sound as
the wind blowing about the curtain in a room might make. She
determined to be certain. Throwing on a skirt and jacket, after
having lighted a candle, she went downstairs quietly, so as not to
awaken the cook, and threw open the door of the study.</p>

<p>Two men were on their knees in front of the safe. Before she
could recover from her surprise or utter a cry they were upon her,
and she felt a strong hand pressed over her mouth.</p>

<p>"All right, my dear," whispered one of them, "don't be
frightened. We won't hurt you. But we'll have to keep you quiet.
Joe&mdash;your handkerchief&mdash;that's right&mdash;sorry to
deprive you of your voice, miss."</p>

<p>"Is it safe?" whispered the other.</p>

<p>"Safe as nails. There's only the cook in the house beside her,
and she's deaf. We won't run for this. But we must tie her up."</p>

<p>The gardener had been pumped effectively.</p>

<p>In one of their bags was a bit of rope. The girl struggled, but
they tied her feet together.</p>

<p>"Let's take her into the bedroom&mdash;next door, Joe."</p>

<p>This was Major and Mrs. Blake's room. They laid Maggie on the
bed, drew one of her arms through the brasswork at the head of the
bedstead, and tied her wrists together.</p>

<p>"Sorry if it's a bit uncomfortable, my dear," said the first
man, "but it can't be helped. Cook'll find you all right in the
morning&mdash;here, you mustn't catch cold&mdash;"</p>

<p>He threw the eiderdown over her, and the two men left the room,
locking the door on the outside cautiously.</p>

<p>"Come along, Joe, we've got to get this safe open&mdash;and it's
worth it."</p>

<p>Maggie lay on the bed, bound and gagged. But the tight cords
round her wrists and ankles did not hurt her half so much as the
thought that she was to blame. For she felt sure the burglars had
entered through the window which she believed, wrongly, she had
left open.</p>

<p>It made her nearly mad to think of her employers being robbed
while she was helpless to do anything. She did not quite know what
was in the safe, except that certain valuables were kept there.
What could she do? If only cook would wake! But, if she did, she
would probably lock herself in her bedroom from fear, and the
thieves would get off. <i>If</i> she could give the alarm!</p>

<p>She turned and twisted in a vain endeavour to free herself, but,
as she did so, one of her hands came in contact with something
against the wall by the head of the bed. It was the button of the
electric light. She twisted it, and the room was illuminated
instantly by a lamp hanging from the centre of the ceiling. Just
then the clock on the mantelpiece struck two. An idea suddenly
occurred to her. She turned off the light and thought it
out&mdash;trying to remember certain things. The window was at the
back of the house, and, fortunately, she had not troubled to draw
down the blind.</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour she lay
waiting&mdash;waiting&mdash;listening to every tick of the clock.
She heard a train go by. That was the up "fish special." It could
not be long now. No! There came a series of sonorous puffs,
suddenly ceasing, and then, "bang&mdash;bang&mdash;bang" as the
brakes of the down goods engine were put on and the buffers of the
heavily-laden trucks behind came crashing together.</p>

<p>A whistle&mdash;then more puffs&mdash;and she knew that the
train was being shunted back into the refuge siding just opposite
the house, where it would remain till the up express passed. And
George Ledbury was on the footplate of that stationary engine. If
only he would look that way! With this prayer on her gagged lips,
she felt again for the little electric button.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Driver Harvey filled his pipe, struck a match and lighted it. He
was looking forward to the end of his run and the comfortable bed
awaiting him. He folded his arms and leant against the side of the
cab meditatively.</p>

<p>Suddenly he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Hullo! Does that girl of yours try to talk to you in the middle
of the night?"</p>

<p>George Ledbury was down by the side of the engine with a lamp
and an oilcan.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he asked.</p>

<p>The driver pointed to the dark outline of the houses in the near
distance.</p>

<p>"Look there," he said, "that's your girl's place, ain't it?
What's she up to? Blowing you kisses when she ought to be in bed
and asleep? I'm ashamed of her!"</p>

<p>And he gave a quiet chuckle.</p>

<p>But George's gaze was fixed on a certain window. Flashes of
light were coming from it in irregular succession, some of them
momentary, others prolonged. He recognised the Morse code in a
second.</p>

<p>"What's she saying?" asked the driver, with another chuckle.</p>

<p>The fireman sprang on the footplate.</p>

<p>"Two words&mdash;over and over again&mdash;this is the third
time."</p>

<p>"What are they, mate?"</p>

<p>"'<i>Help</i>&mdash;<i>Whistle!</i>"' exclaimed the other,
reaching for a little handle at the top of the fire-box.</p>

<p>"What are you up to?" cried the driver.</p>

<p>But George gave no heed to him. A series of shrill screams rose
in the night. He was signalling back with the whistle&mdash;just
two words.</p>

<p>"<i>What's up?</i>"</p>

<p>Then he waited, his eyes fixed on the distant window. Back came
the flashes of light.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the driver.</p>

<p>"<i>Thieves&mdash;in&mdash;the&mdash;house&mdash;help</i>,"
exclaimed George Ledbury, as he made out each word. At this moment
the express came thundering by.</p>

<p>"I must go," cried George.</p>

<p>The driver put a heavy hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"No, my lad," he said, quietly, "you mustn't leave your duty.
Besides, I've a better notion than that. Whistle back '<i>Help
coming soon</i>,' will you? Ah, the signal's off. Go on whistling,
mate."</p>

<p>He opened the regulator and the train moved slowly forward, the
whistle screeching out its message. Opposite the signal-box he
pulled up. The man on duty had his head out of the window.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he shouted. "What's all this row about help
coming?"</p>

<p>For, of course, he understood the code.</p>

<p>"All right," sang out the driver, "there's burglars in one o'
those houses yonder. Tell him which, George."</p>

<p>"Major Blake's house&mdash;'Alma,' Sinclair Avenue."</p>

<p>"You telephone on to Sterrington and ask 'em to send the police
out&mdash;sharp!" cried the driver. The signalman tumbled to it at
once, asking no further questions.</p>

<p>"Right, mate!" he exclaimed, rushing to the telephone. In three
minutes' time the message was transmitted from Sterrington main box
to the superintendent's office. In another three minutes they
received it at the police station. In five minutes more a sergeant
and three constables were pounding along on their bicycles through
the silent streets. The open window was a fairly easy thing to
find, and as the burglars looked up from their work for the second
time that night they stared at the flash of a bull's-eye lantern
and felt the snap of handcuffs before they realised what had
happened.</p>

<p>"Just in time," said the sergeant, pointing to the safe, the
door of which was open.</p>

<p>"Curse you!" muttered one of the men.</p>

<p>"The game's up, Joe," said the other philosophically. "There's a
young woman in the next room, sergeant; she'll feel a bit more
comfortable if you go in and untie her."</p>

<p>They were removing the gag from Maggie's mouth when the sergeant
remarked:</p>

<p>"Smart bit o' work. I wonder who gave the alarm."</p>

<p>"I did!" exclaimed Maggie triumphantly.</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>And then she explained.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>When Major and Mrs. Blake returned at a reasonable hour that
same morning, they found a policeman on the premises. He announced
bluntly that the house had been broken into. The Major began to
fume.</p>

<p>"It's that girl and her followers!" he cried, "I knew what would
happen."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, but it's owing to your servant and her
sweetheart that you haven't lost your stones."</p>

<p>And he told him the story. The Major turned to Maggie, who had
come into the hail.</p>

<p>"Well done!" he cried, "I was a bit hasty. Where does that young
man live?"</p>

<p>"Please, sir, he's in the kitchen, sir. He came to see how I
was."</p>

<p>"Bring him up!" shouted the Major.</p>

<p>Whereupon it fell out that Maggie revoked her month's notice,
and that a nice little sum shortly stood to her credit in the Post
Office Savings Bank. And as George Ledbury is now fireman of a
passenger express, part of that sum will shortly be withdrawn for
the purpose of partly furnishing a little house in the railwaymen's
quarter of Sterrington.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>WINNING THE RACE</h2>

<p>Monsieur De Courcelles, the French Ambassador, sat in the
luxurious little study of the French Embassy in London, pale of
face, hollow eyed, and with brows knitted in dire perplexity. Those
who knew Monsieur de Courcelles in Society, where he was famous for
his courteous manners and his subtly humorous <i>bons mts</i>,
would scarcely have recognised him in the person of this worried
and haggard-looking man.</p>

<p>Though, possibly, just the very few men who knew what was going
on at some of the embassies at that particular time might have
guessed the cause to a certain extent. Diplomatic negotiations of
extreme delicacy were being conducted between three of the great
European powers, a sort of triangular duel in which each minister
for foreign affairs had the interests of his own particular country
to think of, together with possible difficulties with the other
two.</p>

<p>That morning Monsieur de Courcelles had ventured to smile a
little, rub his hands together, and murmur:</p>

<p>"<i>Bon! a marche bien</i>!"</p>

<p>Things seemed going smoothly then. And now, at five o'clock in
the afternoon, a cypher message had been brought in, which upset
all his hopes. He had translated it from the code book himself, and
it lay before him, pencilled on a bit of paper, together with a
time table. Presently he rang the bell.</p>

<p>A well-dressed young man entered the room. A glance at his chief
told him something was wrong. The ambassador shrugged his
shoulders, spread out his hands, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"De Natier left Paris an hour ago. He will be in London
tonight&mdash;and he carries the Treaty with him."</p>

<p>"But that is good, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes. If I can get that Treaty into the hands of the British
Minister before a messenger arrives from Berlin.
Otherwise"&mdash;he threw out his hands again&mdash;"well, you know
clause number three will be struck out, though it is to the
advantage of both of us."</p>

<p>"Well, there should be no difficulty, monsieur. Our information
this morning from our Secret Service in Berlin told us there would
be a delay, and that no messenger would leave Germany till
to-morrow."</p>

<p>The ambassador pushed the paper across the table.</p>

<p>"I have just received this," he said. "Read it."</p>

<p>The Vicomte de St. Croix took the paper and read out loud:</p>

<p>"Von Kriegen left Berlin by Nord Express this morning, crossing
Bayende Challover."</p>

<p>He whistled thoughtfully, arching his eyebrows as he did so.</p>

<p>"Which means?"</p>

<p>"This. De Natier crosses from Belleporte to Fairholt. The boat
starts at 7.10 this evening and the train leaves Fairholt at 9.5,
arriving in London at 10.45. Von Kriegen takes the Bayende
Crossing. His boat leaves about a quarter to four with a passage of
about three and a half hours to Challover. The train leaves
Challover at 8.20, arriving in London at 10.20, just twenty-five
minutes before De Natier does. The result is obvious."</p>

<p>"You mean that Von Kriegen gets his despatches through the
German Ambassador to the Foreign Minister <i>first?</i>"</p>

<p>"Exactly. Which is fatal to us."</p>

<p>The Vicomte de St. Croix, secretary to His Excellency, thought
for a moment or two.</p>

<p>"It's the same line, of course," he said, half to himself, "both
trains run on the East Southern, only the one from Challover has
the start&mdash;running through Fairholt twenty-five minutes before
De Natier's train starts. As you say," he added, turning to the
time table, "it is obvious!"</p>

<p>"What's to be done?" asked the ambassador irritably, tapping the
table with his pen. "Can <i>anything</i> be done to prevent Von
Kriegen getting here first, St. Croix?"</p>

<p>The young man pursed up his lips.</p>

<p>"A motor's out of the question," he said, "so is a special
train. De Natier <i>can't</i> arrive at Fairholt before the other
train has started."</p>

<p>"Can you suggest anything?"</p>

<p>St. Croix shook his head.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing," he said. "If anyone can help us it's
Charlier. He's a wonderful man&mdash;especially with his knowledge
of railways."</p>

<p>The ambassador looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Half-past five," he said. "When can you get Charlier here?"</p>

<p>"I'll telephone to him at once. If he's at home he'll motor down
in less than fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;telephone immediately. I'd promise him ten thousand
francs if he could in any way delay Von Kriegen, without causing
complications."</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later Charlier came and was shown into the
private room of St. Croix. He was a short, dark man, with clean
shaven face. A Frenchman by nationality on his father's side,
Charlier's mother was English, and he himself a mixture. He spoke
both languages fluently and without accent, and had long been
employed in the French Secret Service as an extremely useful and
capable man.</p>

<p>To him St. Croix gave an account of the situation. Charlier took
notes carefully. Then he asked to be supplied with an East Southern
time table.</p>

<p>"Can you suggest anything?" asked St. Croix.</p>

<p>Charlier thought for a minute.</p>

<p>"It is a very difficult problem, monsieur," he said. "I can't
promise anything. If you will allow me, I would like to think it
over alone."</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;but the time?"</p>

<p>Charlier glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"I know," he said, "there is not a moment to lose. But, unless I
have a plan we can do nothing. Stop a minute. Can you send to the
East Southern terminus and ask for the conditions of both crossings
to-day, and the direction of the wind."</p>

<p>"I'll do so at once," replied St. Croix, leaving the room.</p>

<p>Charlier lit a pipe, spread out a map of the East Southern
railway on the table, and then commenced to study it intently,
referring every now and then to the time table.</p>

<p>"It's really a little more than twenty-five minutes' start," he
muttered to himself, "the second train is scheduled a bit faster
than the first. I remember that. Now here's the problem, and a
knotty one it is, too. How to make number two train arrive before
number one. <i>Can</i> it be done? Let's see."</p>

<p>Again he squared himself, and pored over the map.</p>

<p>"Could number one train be got out of the way and number two
pass it? Sounds impossible!"</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes brightened and his finger went down on a
particular place in the map.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> possible&mdash;if the time is short enough.
Twenty-five minutes' interval is too long. Yes&mdash;but how? The
job is, how to tackle the interlocking apparatus."</p>

<p>At this moment St. Croix entered with a message:</p>

<p>"Strong south-westerly wind, channel passages up to time,
crossing from Bayende to Challover probably average."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Charlier, "Von Kriegen's got the wind against
him. If he's only ten minutes late, that's something. Don't
speak&mdash;and don't go, <i>monsieur</i>. I have an idea."</p>

<p>St. Croix watched him. He was making rapid drawings on a bit of
foolscap paper. They looked liked a jumble of lines and curves.
Sometimes he scribbled a few words against a point in his
drawings.</p>

<p>"Lucky I know the place," he said beneath his breath.</p>

<p>Suddenly he sat up.</p>

<p>"It <i>can</i> be done, <i>monsieur</i>," he said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It is possible that De Natier should arrive before Von Kriegen,
but it's a big risk."</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we should not countenance an accident," began St.
Croix.</p>

<p>"<i>Monsieur</i>," interrupted the other, "my plan entails no
accident&mdash;not a soul would be hurt in any way. The risk would
be to the men who undertook the job, and there must be three of us.
If we were discovered, it would mean heavy imprisonment."</p>

<p>"We would give you ten thousand francs. Can you find the other
men?"</p>

<p>"Only one&mdash;Duquesne. And I must give him at least a
thousand."</p>

<p>"You shall have it, Charlier. And I will offer my own
services."</p>

<p>"I've told you the risk, <i>monsieur</i>."</p>

<p>"I'll take it. What is your plan?"</p>

<p>Charlier looked at his watch. It was a quarter to seven.</p>

<p>"There's no time to explain. You have a powerful motor?"</p>

<p>"A sixty-horse Daimhard."</p>

<p>"Good. Duquesne can drive it. You know where I live&mdash;my
flat is close to Westminster Bridge. Can you be there in
half-an-hour?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I'll drive myself."</p>

<p>"Before you start, send someone to the East Southern people. Ask
them to have a special at Fairholt on arrival of the boat. You can
wire down to De Natier to take it?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but even then he'll start <i>after</i> Von
Kriegen."</p>

<p>"I know. But he'll get off ten minutes before the ordinary boat
train, and that ten minutes is everything. Of course, you'll have
him met here?"</p>

<p>"The ambassador will do that."</p>

<p>"Certainly. It's not my affair. I'm going to get him here if I
can. In half-an-hour then, <i>monsieur</i>. That will give us ample
time."</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1300071h-images/p200.png" width=
"1000" border="1">
</p>

<p>An hour and a half later a powerful motor was running at high
speed along the main road from London to Fairholt, out in the open
country. Duquesne was driving, and St. Croix and Charlier occupied
the rear seat, the latter explaining the details of as wild a
scheme as ever entered his subtle brain.</p>

<p>"I cannot quite understand what you mean by the word
interlocking," said St. Croix.</p>

<p>"Apart from technicalities it's really a very simple thing,"
replied the other. "The idea is this: You want to prevent a
signalman from pulling a wrong lever accidentally, and you arrange
a series of intricate locks beneath his box so that he is under the
control of his own signal apparatus. Let us say that A is the lever
which sets the point to run a train off the main line to a branch,
and B is the lever which pulls off the semaphore signal. Well, you
can't pull B before you've pulled A. The pulling of A unlocks the
bar which keeps B rigid."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see."</p>

<p>"So what we're going to do&mdash;oh, here we are. I'll soon show
you."</p>

<p>They had arrived at a very lonely part of the country where the
road ran through a common. A red light here and there betokened the
vicinity of a railway, while some four or five hundred yards across
the common was a little blaze of light from a signal box.</p>

<p>Charlier spoke to the driver and the car stopped. All lights
were extinguished, and they proceeded to run the car a hundred
yards or so over the common.</p>

<p>"No one will suspect it's here," said Charlier. "Yes, turn her
round. We shall have to run off in a hurry by and by. Here are
pistols. They're not loaded, by the way&mdash;only for show. And
masks&mdash;we'll put 'em on. Right! Bring the tools and the wire,
Duquesne."</p>

<p>Then they crept quietly along towards the signal cabin, passing
behind it, and crossing the line at a point about fifty yards
beyond where two tall signal posts showed dimly side by side
against the sky, their two small white back lights shining in the
direction whence the men had come, and their red lights glaring
towards the down track.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of Charlier the three men lay down in some
long grass beside the track.</p>

<p>"There's plenty of time," whispered Charlier, "and I'll explain
the situation. There's only one man in that box, and he is
stationed there to control the Redminster branch line which leaves
the main track opposite his cabin. It's unnecessary to enter into
the complicated details of signalling, but I must just say that he
can't pull the levers to signal a train on to the branch line,
until he has first pulled the lever that sets the points which
transfer the train off the main line to the branch.</p>

<p>"Now these are the 'home signals,' close by us. Two of them. The
inner one is for the main up track and the outer for the branch
line. So, when the inner one shows a green light the driver knows
the main up line is clear, and when the outer one shows 'green' he
knows that his train will go on to the Redminster branch. We've
only to wait till the up express from Frimwell has gone by. The
next train will be the Challover up boat express."</p>

<p>Presently, on the still night air, they heard the bell in the
signal box ring.</p>

<p>"The up train," whispered Charlier.</p>

<p>The wire close beside them creaked as it stretched, and the
semaphore on the inner post went down with a crash, the red light
changing to green. Another wire followed&mdash;the back light of
the "distant" signal ceased to shine like a star in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Directly she's run by we must set to work," said Charlier.
"Duquesne, get the tools ready."</p>

<p>The headlights of the train showed up. Then she passed them with
a roar. The signal arm flew up to danger.</p>

<p>"Quick," said Charlier. "Be ready to lend a hand, as I tell
you."</p>

<p>Then Charlier did a very curious thing. With his cutters he
severed the wires leading from the signal-box to the two signals
close by. He took the broken end of the one attached to the main up
signal and told Duquesne to make a loop at the end of it. Then he
did the same with the end of the other wire leading from the cabin.
With a bit of the wire he had brought he joined these loops
together, the two other men keeping them at a tension. Then he gave
Duquesne his final instructions.</p>

<p>"Directly the train has passed, run along the line about a
couple of hundred yards on the Redminster branch. Light the red
lamp we've brought and stand it in the six-foot way pointing in the
Redminster direction.</p>

<p>"Then hurry back here, and when you see a green light waved from
the signal-box, raise this weighted lever at the foot of the up
main signal. That will depress the arm. Keep it raised till the
next up train runs by, and then rush for the motor, light the
lamps, and start the engine. Now, Monsieur de St. Croix! Got your
pistol? We'll give our friend the signalman a fright."<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Bill Watson, an oldish man, was making an entry in his log book,
when suddenly he heard the door of the cabin open behind him.
Turning, his astonished gaze fell upon two masked men, holding
revolvers pointed straight at him.</p>

<p>"Don't move!" cried the shorter of the two men, "we won't hurt
you, but you've got to do what we tell you."</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked Watson, with a quick side glance at
his telegraph instruments.</p>

<p>"What we <i>don't</i> want is for you to give an alarm.
Understand, we won't have any nonsense."</p>

<p>"What's your game? Train wrecking or robbery?"</p>

<p>"Neither. We shan't do any damage to anybody or anything. In the
first place, remember that I know all the code signals of the East
Southern. Keep him covered," he added, turning to St. Croix.</p>

<p>Charlier stepped forward to the row of signal levers, and
studied the plan of the junction exposed on a board in front.</p>

<p>In order to make quite sure, he asked a few sharp questions of
the signalman, who answered him surlily.</p>

<p>"All right," he exclaimed presently, "now I know just what to
do. Hullo! What train's that?"</p>

<p>"The Challover boat express."</p>

<p>"Good. Accept it&mdash;no tricks now!"</p>

<p>Almost trembling with fear the man gave the "line clear" signal
to the previous block, and was about to pull the levers when
Charlier pushed him aside.</p>

<p>"I'm going to send that train <i>on to the branch</i>."</p>

<p>"You can't," said the man doggedly.</p>

<p>"Can't I?"</p>

<p>He pulled over two levers. The points opposite changed as they
moved. Then he pulled a lever marked "number 6." The signalman
grinned a little.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're up to, but you'll only stop her," he
said. "The driver will see you've taken off the branch signal, and
he won't run on."</p>

<p>Charlier laughed.</p>

<p>"Look at the back lights," he said.</p>

<p>The man looked and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blowed! You've taken off the up main with the branch
lever."</p>

<p>"Exactly! Merely a matter of cutting and joining the wires. You
must see to that afterwards. Now, what train runs after this?"</p>

<p>"A special&mdash;had a wire about her only half an hour ago,"
admitted the signalman.</p>

<p>"That's all right. All I want is to get that special in first.
Ah, here comes the boat train!"</p>

<p>The head lights&mdash;green over white&mdash;drew near. She was
travelling at sixty miles an hour. On she came. All right! The line
was clear. And then, just as she reached the box, she swerved off
and went dashing down the branch.</p>

<p>"Signal back 'line clear'!" thundered Charlier, reversing the
three levers and pulling over number 1. "She'll go a mile before
she pulls up. Good!"</p>

<p>For he saw Duquesne dash past. Three minutes later a warning red
light shone on the branch track towards the train that had passed.
The driver might back her flow, but he would never dare to pass
that light without explanation. St. Croix, his revolver always
pointed at the signalman, waited in tense expectation.</p>

<p>The minutes passed slowly. A series of sharp whistles sounded
down the branch. The driver had discovered the mistake.</p>

<p>Five&mdash;seven&mdash;ten minutes. Then the tail light of the
express appeared. She was backing. Another whistle. The red light
was seen. Charlier snatched up the cabin lamp, turned on the red
shade, and waved it from the door.</p>

<p>"I hope the guard won't run back!" he muttered.
Twelve&mdash;fifteen minutes&mdash;and then a ring on the bell.</p>

<p>"The special?" exclaimed St. Croix.</p>

<p>"Yes!" cried Charlier. "Take her, man&mdash;and send on the line
clear&mdash;hurry up!"</p>

<p>"You can't get her by," said the man. "You can't pull off the
home signal."</p>

<p>Charlier, without a word, turned on the green shade and held out
the lamp. The next instant the back light on the up main
disappeared. Duquesne had carefully obeyed instructions, and,
standing at the foot of the post, had set the signal for the
approaching train. Again the bewildered signalman exclaimed; "Well,
I'm blowed!"</p>

<p>"Here she comes!"</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;the violet and green headlights of a special, pacing
furiously. The men in charge of the express would understand now
why there was a delay in backing on to the main line. At length she
reached the signal post and came dashing past the box.</p>

<p>"Off with you!" cried Charlier to St. Croix. "Sharp. Good-night,
my man&mdash;you're all right. There's no harm done!"</p>

<p>The signalman rushed to the door after them as they ran down the
steps.</p>

<p>"Help!" he yelled at the top of his voice. The guard of the
express, who had run back, came stumbling over the metals, almost
touching St. Croix as the latter vaulted the boundary fence.</p>

<p>"Whiz!"</p>

<p>Duquesne had reached the motor, started the engine, and was in
his seat, steering-wheel in hand. The two men jumped in; off went
the car&mdash;bumping over the grass on the common.</p>

<p>"Which way?" asked Duquesne, as they reached the road.</p>

<p>"London, of course," said Charlier. "Oh, I see what you mean.
Better make a bit of a <i>dtour</i>. We've done our work, and
there's no hurry."</p>

<p>At the terminus of the Fast Southern Railway Monsieur de
Courcelles himself waited on the platform. Somewhere about ten
o'clock he ventured to ask an inspector if the Challover boat
express would soon be in.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the inspector. "The train's delayed.
Something queer seems to have happened down the line, but we don't
exactly know what."</p>

<p>"How long will it be?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you, sir. There's a special from Fairholt due
almost directly. Seems to have overtaken the express and passed it
somehow."</p>

<p>Then the ambassador knew the situation was saved. In ten
minutes' time he was whirling along towards the Foreign Office, the
precious document in his breast pocket.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1300071h-images/p206.jpg" width=
"400" border="1">
</p>

<p>And, when he left, the document duly signed, he found the German
Ambassador's motor had just dashed up.</p>

<p>"You are paying a <i>late</i> visit, Baron!" he exclaimed, as he
raised his hat courteously. To which the other replied, under his
breath, with a throaty German swear word of several syllables.</p>

<p>A week later the French Ambassador met the British Foreign
Minister at a society crush.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way," said the latter, "a strange thing seems to
have happened on one of our railways the night I saw you last. They
were talking about it at the Home Office. I gave them a hint,
Monsieur de Courcelles, that perhaps it might be as well if
Scotland Yard did not press their investigations."</p>

<p>"That was thoughtful of you, my Lord," replied the ambassador,
the vestige of a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>[Note for the benefit of railway experts:&mdash;In order to
simplify the story I have made no reference to the "distant
signals." They would, however, have been worked as follows: For the
boat express the "up distant" could not have been taken off, but,
of course, the driver would have run by it. For the special,
Duquesne would have taken it off, first pulling the lever actuating
the "home main," but, in this case, only pulling a broken wire. The
interlocking details will readily occur to the expert.]</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>THE STRIKERS</h2>

<p>Three third-class coaches were being slowly shunted into the
"bay" at the busy station of Maplehurst. There was nothing out of
the ordinary in the appearance of these particular coaches, beyond
the fact that some of their quarter-lights bore the label, in red
lettering, "Reserved," to which was added in a hasty scrawl, "3.10
p.m. down."</p>

<p>A man, lounging on the platform, eyed them with interest, and
then casually inquired of a porter who was going to travel in them,
speaking with a slight North country accent.</p>

<p>"Soldiers, I think," was the reply. "There was fresh trouble at
Northbury last night, and they're going down to stop the
row&mdash;at least, that's what I've heard."</p>

<p>The other man thanked him quietly for the information, and
glanced at his watch. It was about one o'clock. Then he strolled
towards a time-table, which he consulted carefully, and with
apparent interest in the 3.10 p.m. down train.</p>

<p>He satisfied himself that this train, an express, arrived at
Northbury at 4.32, and then he made his way out of the station to
the post-office, from which he dispatched a telegram addressed to
Northbury.</p>

<p>A smile of satisfaction appeared on his rather sickly and
saturnine face as he emerged into the street.</p>

<p>"Well," he said to himself, "at any rate, I've given them due
warning of what's going to happen, and I hope they'll take
advantage of it. Sending hired butchers&mdash;that's what I call
it."</p>

<p>That morning the newspapers were full of the strike riots at
Northbury. A dispute had occurred, a few weeks previously, between
some iron-foundry owners and the workers, and all attempts at
settlement had proved futile. Then the trouble had broken out, and
mobs of nondescript hooligans had allied themselves to the more
discontented of the strikers, and violent measures had been the
result. Property was wrecked indiscriminately, machinery damaged,
and many of the local police seriously injured.</p>

<p>The authorities&mdash;actuated perhaps by humane but, as the
sequel had proved, not too wise motives&mdash;had been reluctant to
call in the aid of the military, and the reinforcements of police
from the surrounding district had proved quite inadequate to cope
with the tumult. Men's passions had been aroused to a very
dangerous degree, and the whole neighbourhood was seething.</p>

<p>What had roused the anger of the strikers especially was the
fact that one or two foundries were being partially worked by
"blacklegs," and that a few mineral trains laden with pig iron were
leaving Northbury daily.</p>

<p>There was already much violent talk of reprisals against the
railway company, and the station and sidings at Northbury were
carefully guarded by police.</p>

<p>In travelling down to Northbury, one came upon the iron district
quite suddenly. A little over an hour's run by express train from
Maplehurst was the sleepy old country town of Raebon, situated in
the midst of a quiet agricultural district, and showing little sign
of life.</p>

<p>Beyond Raebon the railway ran through a lonesome, desolate bit
of country, with tracts of heath and woodland and a few scattered
houses. There was no station until one reached Tarlington, some
eight miles distant from Raebon, and this was only a little wayside
place with scant accommodation for any shunting purposes.</p>

<p>Then the train, after running another mile or so, entered a deep
cutting through a range of hills, and passed beyond into an
entirely different country. Fields and trees and moors seemed to
have vanished as if by magic, their places being taken by rows of
sidings, the tall chimneys of the foundries, and colonies of little
houses, between all of which the train ran till it reached the
large and important station of Northbury, three and a half miles
beyond Tarlington.</p>

<p>At this same station of Tarlington no one could have guessed, on
that particular afternoon, that just over those low hills to the
north, half the men of the countryside had gone mad. There was an
air of serene repose about the little wayside station. Harding, the
station-master and booking-clerk combined, was seated in his office
making out returns; Jameson, the solitary porter, was whistling
merrily as he trimmed lamps in the porter's room.</p>

<p>At the up end of the platform stood the signal-box, and the
stern warning on the outside to the effect that no unauthorised
person was allowed therein was being disregarded in the most
barefaced manner in the person of Johnny Harding, the
station-master's small boy, aged ten, who was enjoying his Saturday
holiday in the company of Crake, the signalman, and more especially
those moments of it when Crake allowed him to return a call or to
pull over such of the levers as yielded to his boyish strength.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, Johnny knew as much about the working of the
Tarlington box as Crake did himself. The boy was a railway
enthusiast, and could tell you the name or number of every engine
on the system, and had the code signals by heart, to say nothing of
the scheduled, time of every train, stopping and express, that ran
through the station, with an accuracy of memory equal to the
"working time-table" itself.</p>

<p>The bell suddenly rang out, the "be-ready" signal. Crake
returned it. Then he went to the telephone.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"An up mineral train just leaving Northbury," replied the
signalman as he hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>"Minerals" were running anyhow that week. Crake accepted it, and
a little disc marked "train on line" appeared in the instrument in
front of him. The "mineral" had started from Northbury.</p>

<p>The boy took up the pen on the booking-desk, and glanced at the
clock. All movements of trains have to be entered carefully.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src="1300071h-images/p210.jpg" width=
"1000" border="1">
</p>

<p>"3.36," he said, as he wrote it down; "how about the 3.58 slow
passenger train from Northbury?"</p>

<p>"She's to pass the mineral train here," replied Crake.</p>

<p>Which meant that the mineral train was to be shunted off the up
main line at Tarlington to allow of the passage of the slow
passenger train, and was then to follow the latter.</p>

<p>The boy took a glance out of the window. There was a "refuge
siding," leading back from the up main line, and this siding was
full of empty trucks. The accommodation at Northbury was becoming
limited, and these trucks were an "overflow."</p>

<p>"There won't be room," he said presently.</p>

<p>"Doesn't matter," replied Crake, as he pulled off the home
signal, "the down main's clear for the next-half hour or more. She
can go into that for the time being."</p>

<p>Heavy wreaths of steam came puffing up through the cutting. The
mineral train came lumbering along. The driver shut off steam and
crawled through the station, bringing his engine to a standstill
opposite the box.</p>

<p>Crake slid the window open and looked out. The train was a heavy
one.</p>

<p>"You'll have to go on the down main," he said.</p>

<p>"Right!" answered the driver, exactly understanding the
situation.</p>

<p>"How are things going yonder?" asked the signalman, jerking his
thumb in the direction of Northbury.</p>

<p>"Bad, mate&mdash;bad as can be. They've lost their heads. We
shouldn't ha' got out half an hour later&mdash;there ain't enough
police to stop 'em. There's a talk o' the soldiers coming
down."</p>

<p>"Pretty nigh time something was done," replied Crake, who had
little sympathy with the strikers.</p>

<p>"You're right, mate. Well, I'm glad I shall be out of it
to-night."</p>

<p>He started the engine and the train moved slowly on, coming to a
halt when it had gone a few hundred yards. Then Crake pulled the
necessary levers and signalled with his arm through the box. The
train came back, crossing over to the down line, and remained
stationary alongside the platform. Thus the up line was made clear
for the coming passenger train.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the train from Northbury was signalled, the
station-master and the porter appeared on the up platform, together
with three or four passengers, and the train came in.</p>

<p>It was just at this moment that Johnny, looking out of the
signal-box, caught sight of a dense black mass coming along the
road down the hill; as the train moved out of the station the sound
of singing arose.</p>

<p>"Look there!" exclaimed the boy, "what's up?"</p>

<p>Crake threw back the starting signal lever and glanced out of
the box. A crowd of men was rushing down the hill towards the
station, singing and shouting.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he cried, "they must be some of the Northbury
lot&mdash;what are they doing here?"</p>

<p>Remembering his duty, however, he turned towards his instruments
again. It has been said that the next station on the up line was
Raebon, but the next "block" was a little signal-box halfway
between the two stations known as "Tedworth level-crossing."</p>

<p>There were no sidings or cross-over points at this box; it
merely guarded the level-crossing of the country road which gave it
its name. Crake waited till the bell warned him that the passenger
train had passed this box; he returned this signal, and the disc in
the "up" instrument changed from "train on line" to "line clear."
He could now send the mineral train forward.</p>

<p>He had already pulled over the levers once more for this purpose
when the crowd of men and hooligans burst into the station. Before
they knew what had happened, the unfortunate station-master and
porter found themselves seized by rough hands and forced into the
porter's room, and the key was tamed upon them.</p>

<p>Crake stood, hand on the lever he had just turned over,
thunderstruck. The boy's quicker wits grasped the
situation&mdash;or, at least, part of it.</p>

<p>"Quick&mdash;the telephone!" he cried.</p>

<p>Crake turned to the instrument when half-a-dozen men rushed up
the steps and invaded the cabin. Johnny, half from fear, slid
behind the desk and crouched down on the floor.</p>

<p>"No you don't!" exclaimed a tall, stalwart man, evidently the
leader, as he struck down Crake's hand from the bell push. "We're
not going to do you any harm, mate, if you keep quiet and do as
you're told&mdash;if not, you'll bring it on yourselves. Tie him
up, lads!"</p>

<p>In two minutes Crake was bound down to the solitary chair the
box contained. The boy breathed hard behind the desk. He was not
discovered.</p>

<p>"Now," said the leader, "which of you chaps said you knew how to
work these things?" and he pointed to the instruments and
levers.</p>

<p>"I did, Sinclair," said a short man, stepping forward, "I was on
the line myself once."</p>

<p>"Right. Then see to it that no messages get through&mdash;and
that the down express comes along&mdash;d'ye understand,
Macpherson?"</p>

<p>"Aye! I can get her through&mdash;if that's what you want,
mate."</p>

<p>"It's not quite what I want," exclaimed the other, "I haven't
made up my mind yet&mdash;the first thing to do is to clear out
this pig iron. I'll be back directly."</p>

<p>Outside, the mob had already attacked the hated mineral train.
The driver, seeing the points rightly set, had attempted to start,
but was quickly dragged off the footplate together with the
fireman. Sinclair stood on the little platform outside the box,
surveying the scene. They were letting down the sides of the
trucks, and the heavy pigs of iron came crashing out upon the
platform on one side and the six-foot way on the other.</p>

<p>An ugly expression came over the face of the strike leader.
Three days' rioting had turned him from a usually phlegmatic north
countryman into a brute, and there was a gleam of murder in his
grey eyes. Within his breast pocket was a certain telegram which he
had received from Maplehurst a few hours previously.</p>

<p>They were going to send soldiers down, were they? Soldiers who
might possibly fire upon him and his comrades. Let them see to it,
then. If anything happened they would bring it upon their own
heads, curse them!</p>

<p>Suddenly he turned and came back into the signal-box.</p>

<p>"What time does the down express pass Raebon?" he asked Crake
abruptly.</p>

<p>"4.17," replied the signalman sullenly.</p>

<p>Sinclair looked at the clock. It was very nearly that time now.
"And what time does she run through here?"</p>

<p>Sinclair went out again and shouted to the madmen below. They
stopped in their work of destruction.</p>

<p>"Let's hear Sinclair!" cried a voice.</p>

<p>"Ah, hear me, lads!" shouted the ringleader. "There's a train
coming down&mdash;it's nearly due now&mdash;with three carriages
full of soldiers. D'ye know what <i>that</i> means?"</p>

<p>Wild yells of execration answered him.</p>

<p>"Once they're let loose on ye," he went on, "there'll be murder
done. But I've a plan for stopping them. Leave yon train in the
way, and they'll have to stop here. There are a couple of hundred
of us. We can storm the carriages before they know where they are
and break up their rifles. Who's game?"</p>

<p>Wild voices answered him and hoarse cheers rose from the
maddened crowd.</p>

<p>"We'll do it, mate!"</p>

<p>"Right. <i>What are you doing with the engine?</i>"</p>

<p>He had suddenly seen some of the men uncoupling the engine of
the mineral train, while one had sprung on the footplate. It was
just at this precise moment that the bell rang out in the cabin and
Macpherson received the signal from Tedworth level-crossing box
that the express had left Raebon.</p>

<p>In obedience to the orders of Sinclair he began to pull the
levers which actuated the signals for the express. But they would
not move because they had been locked by Crake when the latter
pulled the two levers to shunt the mineral train from the down to
the up line. Macpherson saw this and replaced these two levers. He
could now set the signals for the express.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, man," exclaimed Crake, observing what was going
on&mdash;"there's a train standing there&mdash;on the down
road."</p>

<p>"I know there is," said Macpherson, pulling off the home and
distant signals. "That's our game. When the driver sees it he'll
stop the express&mdash;don't you worry, mate."</p>

<p>"What are you doing with the engine?" cried Sinclair once
more.</p>

<p>"Going to send her up the line," answered the man on the
footplate, "she shan't have a chance of drawing a mineral train
this journey."</p>

<p>"Stop, you fool!" thundered Sinclair.</p>

<p>But the man had already opened the throttle valve and jumped off
the footplate. The great engine began to move forward.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" screamed Macpherson, seeing what was happening,
"the crossing points are not set! She'll run into the express!"</p>

<p>The old habit had come back to him. He was no longer the mad
ironworker on strike, but the signalman on duty.</p>

<p>But it was too late now for him to transfer the engine to the
other line. The heavy locomotive gathering speed, took the down
metals, and rushed forward to meet the express <i>on the same line
of rails</i>. Sinclair saw what had happened in a moment. He also
grasped the fact of the awful catastrophe that must take place when
the two engines met. And a thrill of diabolical joy welled through
him. Let it happen, then! No human power could prevent it now.</p>

<p>"Clear out, Macpherson!" he cried. Then, addressing the mob, who
stood paralysed on trucks and platforms, he shouted:</p>

<p>"Out of the station, lads! Back home, every one of you!"</p>

<p>There was a scramble out of the trucks and across metals and
platforms. A panic seemed to have seized the men as they realised
the horrible thing that was going to happen. They poured out of the
station faster than they had entered it, leaving Harding the
station-master, the porter, driver, and fireman under lock and key,
and the signalman fast bound.</p>

<p>The only other railway official, the brakesman of the mineral
train, had long since jumped from his van and hurried back along
the line towards Northbury to summon assistance.</p>

<p>One person, and one person only was left free at the station,
and that was Johnny Harding. He came out from behind the desk,
ghastly pale, but with all his wits about him. And he flew to the
telephone.</p>

<p>"It's too late," said Crake, "nothing can save the express now.
Look at the clock!"</p>

<p>The clock marked 4.20. The express was approaching from Raebon
at full speed&mdash;and the engine of the goods train, a tiny speck
in the distance now, was rushing forward to meet it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in sheer desperation, the boy pushed the little
knob to ring up Tedworth level-crossing box&mdash;where the express
was due at 4.22.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Old Joe Salter sat in his little box at Tedworth level-crossing,
stirring the fire in his stove with his wooden leg. Years before,
he had lost a leg in the company's service, and was relegated to
his present post, which was a light one. He had to open and shut
the gates of his crossing, and act as the midway "block" between
Raebon and Tarlington. His signal cabin, with its five levers, two
each for up and down home and distant signals, and one for locking
his gates, was on the ground level.</p>

<p>He had received the signal that the express had left Raebon, and
duly accepted it and passed it on to Tarlington. His gates were
open to the line, and his down signals pulled off. All was right.
Over one of the gates hung a youth, with a team of horses behind
him, drawing a felled tree trunk on a low waggon, waiting till the
train had passed. It would do so in another two minutes, for it was
just 4.20 o'clock, and the train was well up to time.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a ring at the bell. Somebody wanted to speak
to him from Tarlington. He rose, went to the telephone, and gave
the answering ring. Then he raised the instrument to his ear.
Johnny Harding's voice came through.</p>

<p>"Stop the express&mdash;quick&mdash;stop the express."</p>

<p>It was unusual, but the old man never stayed to question it.
"Clang&mdash;clang" back went the two levers, and two signal arms
rose to "danger," one, the distant, half-a-mile up the line, and
the other about three hundred yards from his box, in the same
direction. The express might pass the "distant," but not the
"home."</p>

<p>He returned to the telephone.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, then?" he asked.</p>

<p>His face blanched as the appalling news came through.</p>

<p>"The strikers&mdash;they've sent on a goods engine&mdash;on the
down metals&mdash;by itself&mdash;no one on footplate&mdash;it'll
wreck the express&mdash;can you do anything?"</p>

<p>The old man dropped the receiver, dazed for a moment. Then he
shouted back:</p>

<p>"When did it start?"</p>

<p>"Four or five minutes ago&mdash;can you do anything?"</p>

<p>Joe Salter gazed round wildly. Then the inspiration came.</p>

<p>"Yes!" he shouted, and threw back the locking lever.</p>

<p>The next moment he was stumping over the lines to the gates. The
whistle of the express sounded, shrieking for its right of way. He
glanced in the other direction. A puff of white rose above the
distant trees. Hauling the gates open, he cried to the astonished
youth:</p>

<p>"Bring your lot across&mdash;quick! There's no time for
question&mdash;hurry up, lad!"</p>

<p>Wondering dimly why a train should be stopped to make way for
his load, the yokel gee'd up his horses and led them forward
slowly. The great tree trunk was across the down metals.</p>

<p>"Stop&mdash;unlatch the chain your side&mdash;look alive,
sonny&mdash;I'll see to this one."</p>

<p>The chain traces were quickly loosed.</p>

<p>"Now!" thundered the old man, "off with those horses&mdash;for
your life, lad! Lash them up!"</p>

<p>Just then the goods engine rounded a curve and came thundering
along. The youth, his dull brain roused at last, needed no further
warning. He struck out with his whip at the horses, and ran after
them as they plunged at a gallop along the road, followed by old
Joe Salter stumping along as fast as his wooden leg would allow
him.</p>

<p>As the crash came, he turned. It was an appalling sight. The
great engine ran full tilt into the waggon and tree trunk, seemed
to push both out of its way, literally staggered on, tearing up
metals and throwing ballast in clouds, shook, tottered, thundered,
and hissed. Finally it rolled over on its side, a mass of metal,
steam, and flying wheels, dragging itself many yards along the side
of the line, breathing its dying breath in the form of a white
cloud of vapour intermixed with glowing embers.</p>

<p>The express was saved&mdash;by not much more than a hundred
yards!<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Half-an-hour later the breakdown train, with its wonderful
hydraulic crane and lifts, came down from Northbury, and a gang of
men set to work instantly to clear the road of the masses of
<i>dbris</i>, and to lay rails for the passage of the express over
the ruined gap. Long before then soldiers and passengers had
clustered round the plucky old man to whom they owed their lives,
and not one of them grudged his coin when the hat went round.</p>

<p>The soldiers reached Northbury several hours late, but their
services were not required that night. A fear&mdash;a horror had
run through the hearts of the more violent of the strikers. Besides
which, they wanted leaders, and Sinclair and Macpherson were
nowhere to be found, then or at any other time.</p>

<p>A week later two persons "trod the carpet" in the General
Manager's office, an old wooden-legged man and a small boy. And the
"G. M.," when he had finished his complimentary speech, which was
accompanied by something else of a substantial nature,
remarked:</p>

<p>"Well, Salter, I think it's time you were placed in honourable
retirement&mdash;you've well earned it. As for you, Johnny, I hope
you <i>won't</i> retire. We must make a railway man of you, my boy,
later on. And I hope you'll never have to sacrifice an engine to
save an express again. But it was worth it, and the company is
proud of the services of both of you!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>THE RUSE THAT SUCCEEDED</h2>

<p>A spick and span little steam yacht was slowly entering the tiny
harbour of Porthaven. The tide was ebbing fast and the pier master
shouted a few directions, for the channel of available water was
not very wide. She flew the French tricolour flag astern, and the
pennant of a well-known French yacht club on her foremast. On the
bridge, smoking a cigarette, stood a little man, every bit as spick
and span as the yacht herself; a typical Frenchman, dressed in a
spotless white duck suit, with very sharp, piercing brown eyes
which scanned the quayside narrowly.</p>

<p>There was nothing remarkable in the entrance of a French yacht
into the little harbour of Porthaven. It was the height of the
yachting season, and a dozen other small private craft lay there at
anchor, or were moored alongside the quay. The owner of one of
them, standing on deck with a pair of glasses, remarked to a lady
who stood by his side:</p>

<p>"That's <i>Hirondelle</i> coming in. She belongs to a chap named
De Natoye&mdash;there he is, on the bridge. I met him at Cannes
this spring."</p>

<p>"A Frenchman?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and a rich one too. A very jolly chap. I'll have the
dinghy out and pay him a call when he comes to anchor. Welcome him
to English waters."</p>

<p>For the next few days De Natoye was welcomed not only by this
particular owner of a yacht, but also by everyone of note in
Port-haven. He was an agreeable little man, bright and vivacious,
and his presence added much to the society gathered at the seaside
resort. Once or twice he pleaded excuses for not accepting
invitations to lunch or dinner, and on these occasions it might
have been noticed that he took an express to London, and was not
arrayed in yachting garb.</p>

<p>But with Monsieur De Natoye himself and his elegant steam yacht
this story does not deal directly, although he was the leading
cause that led to a curious railway incident. It will be necessary,
therefore, to leave <i>Hirondelle</i> at her moorings in Porthaven
harbour, and to transfer the scene to London&mdash;hot and out of
season at the end of August.</p>

<p>Night had set in when, out of one of the little side streets in
that strange district called Soho, there came into Wardour Street
an unobtrusive little man, who glanced once or twice over his
shoulders as if to see whether anyone were following him or not. A
look of satisfaction passed over his face as he made up his mind
that, apparently, he was unobserved. Porthaven yachtsmen, looking
at him closely, would have noticed that he was Monsieur De Natoye,
and would have remembered that he had refused, with most polite
excuses, to attend a dinner that night on board Lord Feverel's
yacht <i>Firefly</i>.</p>

<p>Arrived in Piccadilly Circus he lit a cigarette, unbuttoned the
light dust-coat he was wearing, disclosing an expanse of
shirt-front beneath, and strolled leisurely in the direction of a
famous <i>caf</i>, where men of all nations congregate. It being
out of the season, there were not many present.</p>

<p>Seated in a corner, a Benedictine on the table in front of him,
a cigar in his mouth, was a tall, military-looking man, with a big
moustache and keen grey eyes. Anyone who knew anything of the
diplomatic world would have recognised him at once as Colonel
Sibthorpe, attached to the Foreign Office, "a deuced good berth,
and nothing to do, what?" as some of his military friends said.</p>

<p>In fact, no one seemed to know quite what the Colonel's exact
mission was. He made pleasant little Continental tours, he lounged
about town, was an agreeable companion, and knew what was going on
in the world. That was all most men could say about him.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Natoye walked up to him. The Colonel nodded
affably.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he exclaimed, "you in town? What brings you to this
dull metropolis?"</p>

<p>"Business&mdash;a leetle business, Colonel," answered the
Frenchman, sitting down beside him.</p>

<p>The Colonel motioned to a waiter.</p>

<p>"A Benedictine?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly. Thank you."</p>

<p>"Bring me another, too."</p>

<p>"Yessir."</p>

<p>When the drinks arrived the Colonel, leaning back in the chair,
said nonchalantly in a low tone: "Well? Settled it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered De Natoye, sinking his voice to the level of the
other.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Wednesday."</p>

<p>"What time?"</p>

<p>"He takes the 7.15 train from London."</p>

<p>"And reaches Porthaven?"</p>

<p>"At 10.42."</p>

<p>"You sail at once?"</p>

<p>"No. The tide will not serve before half-past one in the
morning."</p>

<p>The Colonel puffed at his cigar thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Anyone suspect?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"We think not, but we are not sure."</p>

<p>"Humph."</p>

<p>"You will help us?"</p>

<p>"Only as far as I can&mdash;you know my position?"</p>

<p>The Frenchman nodded. Someone sat down at the next table, a
foreigner apparently. The Colonel raised his voice.</p>

<p>"You are staying in town to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ah! Glad to have seen you. I must be off. Good-night!"</p>

<p>He finished his liqueur, shook hands with De Natoye, strolled
outside on the pavement, and hailed a taxi.</p>

<p>"Kensington High Street."</p>

<p>"Whereabouts, sir?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the station will do."</p>

<p>Arrived there, he got out, dismissed the taxi, and walked some
little distance in the Hammersmith direction till he came to a row
of ugly-looking houses standing back from the Street. Taking a
quick glance on either side first, he went up to the door of one of
these houses and rang the bell. The servant came.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brett at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but I think he's engaged."</p>

<p>The Colonel took a card from his pocket, a blank one, wrote a
few words upon it, and handed it to her.</p>

<p>"Give him that and I think he'll see me."</p>

<p>In less than a minute the servant was showing him into a room at
the back of the house. An alert-looking, clean-shaven man of middle
height rose from the desk at which he was seated.</p>

<p>"I didn't expect you, sir," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"No," replied the Colonel as he took a seat, "but I've a bit of
work on hand that I think requires your services."</p>

<p>Brett closed the door and locked it, his face betraying no
surprise. He was accustomed to secret commissions from the Foreign
Office; in fact he made his living chiefly by this means. Not that
he stood in any official capacity. He knew very well the risks he
ran, and that if he walked into trouble he could expect no open
help from those whom he served. The secret agent of a Government
often has important work to do, and does it well as a trusted
servant, but he must never expect to be recognised officially.</p>

<p>The Colonel lit a cigar, took a notebook from his pocket, and
consulted it carefully. Presently he said:</p>

<p>"You know a man named Koravitch&mdash;a Russian, don't you?"</p>

<p>Brett thought for a moment. Then he replied: "Yes. Goes by the
name of Martin sometimes." The Colonel nodded. Brett unlocked a
cabinet and took a small, indexed book from it.</p>

<p>"Here he is," he said presently, "Koravitch, Russian subject. A
suspect in Russia. Gave information on Roumanian question. Known to
the French Secret Service. Useful man."</p>

<p>The Colonel nodded.</p>

<p>"That's the chap," he said, "do you happen to know where he is
now?"</p>

<p>Brett again consulted his notebook.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in England&mdash;unless he's left the country during
the last fortnight&mdash;which would have been difficult," he added
grimly.</p>

<p>"It would have been difficult, as you say," replied the Colonel.
"I see you're up-to-date, Brett."</p>

<p>"It's my business, sir. Do you want Koravitch? I can soon lay my
hand on him."</p>

<p>"So can I. But we don't want him just now. Let me give you the
facts of the case. Koravitch, as you said just now, is a useful
man&mdash;both to us and the French Government. But the Russians
don't want him on the Continent. They know very well he's
here&mdash;they made it too hot for him in his own
country&mdash;and the Russian police have been keeping him under
observation. But as long as he remains in England they'll leave him
alone. Well, as it happens, there's a very good reason why he
should go to France just now."</p>

<p>"I see&mdash;and you want me to get him over there quietly?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. That's the affair of the French Secret Service,
not ours. And it's been arranged. You know Monsieur De Natoye?"</p>

<p>Brett's eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"One of the cleverest little fellows they've got."</p>

<p>"Quite so. Well, he's got a yacht lying at Porthaven, ready to
take Koravitch off. I owe him a good turn, and although, as I said,
the affair is not ours, and we can't take any definite action,
still I'm anxious he should get Koravitch away."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do, sir?"</p>

<p>"The case stands thus. Directly the Russian police suspect the
man's leaving England, they'll arrest him. They've got a plausible
reason&mdash;so plausible that international complications would
arise if any department went to the Home Office and stopped
interference.</p>

<p>"You mean, sir, that our police would have to help the Russians
if called upon?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. They're hardly likely to do that&mdash;I don't think
they will&mdash;but our police must be kept out of it. Now,
Koravitch takes the 7.15 train to Porthaven at the terminus of the
London Eastern and Porthaven line on Wednesday night. He arrives
there at 10.42, but De Natoye's yacht can't get out before one,
because of the tide. What the Russian police will do, if they
suspect anything, is this. They'll either have Koravitch arrested
before he leaves London, or they'll go down to Porthaven and nab
him on the boat. He's not out of the wood till the yacht starts.
Then De Natoye will see to it."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do, sir?"</p>

<p>"If you can, shadow the whole thing unostentatiously, and, if
there is a danger of the arrest taking place, prevent it. You'll
earn a big fee. But, remember, I can give you no support in any
way."</p>

<p>"That's understood, sir. Anyhow I'll try my best."</p>

<p>The Colonel shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Right! You know your game then. Don't come to me about
it&mdash;at all events, until Thursday, when it will have been
played out one way or another. Good night!"<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Turning over the papers on the bookstall at the London terminus
of the London Eastern and Porthaven Railway stood Brett, apparently
a nondescript individual with plenty of time on his hands. But he
was by no means idle. The centre of observation was the gateway to
number 7 platform close by, from which the 7.15 express to
Porthaven started. It was just after seven now, and the train was
drawn up in readiness. Brett scrutinised quietly every person who
went through the gate. He also kept his eyes from time to time on
the door leading from the booking office, and took searching
glances round the big open space between the station buildings and
the entrances to the various platforms.</p>

<p>At ten minutes past seven a man walked quickly across this space
to where Brett was standing; it was one of his subordinates.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, "he's taking his ticket. I followed him
all the way in a taxi."</p>

<p>"See anyone?"</p>

<p>[Words missing? - possibly "No-one."</p>

<p>"They're artful," replied Brett, "I've had to deal with them
before. Go outside and watch everyone who comes to the station. If
you see them, come at once. If we can, we must stop them
somehow."</p>

<p>The man went back. In a couple of minutes an individual came
across to platform number 7, a man with a large head and wearing a
soft hat turned down over his forehead. Brett recognised him by his
walk.</p>

<p>"Koravitch!" he said to himself. "I expect the poor beggar feels
precious nervous."</p>

<p>He watched him take a seat in the train. A sudden thought
occurred to him. He glanced at the clock. It was now 7.10.</p>

<p>"Allow me to speak to a friend who is leaving by this
train?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," said the polite official, letting him through
the gate.</p>

<p>He went up to the carriage. The man within gave a start as
Brett's head poked itself into the window.</p>

<p>"All right," said the latter, "I know. The coast is clear, but
if they should come at the last moment drop out on the other side
and let them board the train. If not, when you get down make your
friend take his yacht out the instant the tide serves. That's
all."</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply he hurried back to his post of
observation and watched the clock.</p>

<p>Twelve minutes past&mdash;thirteen&mdash;fourteen&mdash;surely
it was all right now.</p>

<p>No! Suddenly he saw his fellow detective rushing across. He ran
forward to meet him.</p>

<p>"Three of them!" said the man.</p>

<p>"Right. Charge!" exclaimed Brett, in a low voice.</p>

<p>Three men came dashing out of the booking office close on each
other's heels. Without a word Brett and his assistant rushed
forward with their heads down to meet them. As they did so Brett
heard the bell ring at the platform entrance.</p>

<p>They tilted against the first man, fell in a heap, and the other
two came tripping over them. There was a little chorus of strange
oaths; one of the men picked himself up and made a dash for number
7 platform.</p>

<p>"Too late, sir," said the collector, indicating, with a jerk of
his thumb, the outgoing train.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you ought to apologise to us, or we to
you," said Brett, blandly, "the meeting was so mutual!"</p>

<p>The leader of the three men looked at him with a scowl of
suspicion. Brett raised his hat politely, and passed on,
remarking:</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't mind apologising. I'm very sorry to have caused
you any inconvenience."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said his subordinate, as they passed out of
the station.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," replied Brett.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"If they've as much common sense as I have&mdash;and I certainly
give them credit for that&mdash;they'll find an easy way out of the
difficulty."</p>

<p>"But it's the last train to Porthaven!"</p>

<p>"On this line," said Brett, drily. "Come in here and have a
drink. This thing's got to be thought out."</p>

<p>Brett explained as they sat in the corner of a private bar.</p>

<p>"The case is like this," he said. "There's one way, and only one
way of getting to Porthaven tonight before the yacht sails, and
it's this. You know Melfield, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. About a hundred miles down the line, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"That's right. A local train leaves Melfield at 11.5, arriving
at Porthaven just after half-past twelve. If they catch that,
Koravitch won't get out of the country."</p>

<p>"But how can they catch it?"</p>

<p>"By taking the 9.5 on the South Midland Railway to Melfield. It
arrives there at 10.48. The South Midland and the London Eastern
and Porthaven stations at Melfield are just over a mile apart.
They'd do it easily if they took a motor."</p>

<p>"I see&mdash;but not if the train were late?"</p>

<p>"That train never is late. It nearly always runs to time."</p>

<p>"If it could be delayed on the journey&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied Brett. "That's just the problem I'm trying to
work out. I want to delay that train and I want to do it without
any risk of danger to anyone&mdash;that is, of course, if they
travel by it&mdash;as I think they will. And there isn't much
time."</p>

<p>He lit his pipe and smoked thoughtfully for a few minutes. Then
a smile came into his face.</p>

<p>"I know something about railways," he said, "and the way they're
worked. And I have an idea I can make that train late at
Melfield."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"With a good strong gimlet!"</p>

<p>"A <i>gimlet?</i>"</p>

<p>"I haven't time to explain. You go straight to the South Midland
Terminus and keep a look-out. Don't let them see you. At ten
minutes to nine you'll see me by the bookstall&mdash;I shall be
dressed as an old man. Let me know if they are there. That's all.
I've just got time to run home and change first."</p>

<p>Before he called a taxi to take him home, Brett entered a shop
close by and purchased a large, strong gimlet, with a sharp screw
point, carefully examining it to see that it was good steel.</p>

<p>About a quarter to nine an old man walked slowly into the
terminus of the South Midland Railway. Clouds had come over the
evening sky, and darkness had set in prematurely. He loitered about
by the bookstall till his subordinate came up.</p>

<p>"You were right," said the latter, "they're all three here, and
they've taken tickets for Melfield."</p>

<p>"Good! You needn't wait. If you like to come to my house in an
hour's time I'll explain things to you."</p>

<p>The South Midland Terminus is constructed on a different
principle from that of the London Eastern and Porthaven, in that
passengers have free access to all the platforms. Brett made his
way to number 4, from which he ascertained the Melfield train
started. It was just being slowly backed in, the red tail light
gleaming as it came down the line to the buffer stops at the "dead
end." Brett knew that the chief difficulty of his task was to
escape the notice of the officials. He entered a compartment at the
rear end of the train, crossed the floor of the carriage, opened
the further door, and, closing it behind him, dropped down on the
line beyond, between the train and another that stood on the
neighbouring metals.</p>

<p>Then he made his way cautiously to the back of the train and
crawled under the last coach, coming out behind it&mdash;between it
and the "dead end." It was fairly dark here, with the exception of
the gleam from the red lamp.</p>

<p>It was this red lamp that Brett wanted&mdash;for less than a
minute. Making up his mind for a bold attempt he reached for it,
removed it from its socket behind the coach, put it on the ground,
and, stooping down, removed the lamp itself from its outer case.
Then, with a sharp prod from his gimlet, he bored a hole at the
bottom of the oil receptacle, giving the tool a quick turn
afterwards. The oil came dripping out.</p>

<p>In ten seconds the leaking lamp was replaced on its socket, and
Brett was under the coach again. He managed to slip out unobserved,
and to gain platform number 5 through the other train. Before he
left the station he saw the three Russian police agents enter the
Melfield express. Then he went home satisfied, saying to
himself:</p>

<p>"Even if they order a special to Porthaven at Melfield they
can't get there in time. It would take too long to get one out. I
should like to be on that train and see the effect."</p>

<p>The effect was very simple. A red tail light is placed at the
rear of a train for several reasons&mdash;to protect it should it
be at a standstill, and, more especially, to notify to signalmen on
duty that the whole of the train has passed, and that the line
behind, therefore, is clear.</p>

<p>Slowly, but surely, the oil trickled out of that particular
lamp, until none was left. The train had run some fifty or sixty
miles of its journey when the light finally drooped and went out.
The first man who noticed something was wrong was the signalman in
charge of an obscure roadside cabin named "Cherrington Box." He
gave a little start as the train whisked by, and then promptly
obeyed his printed orders. That is to say, he went to his
signalling apparatus, and sent forward to the next box the code
signal of his line, seven beats, a pause, and a final beat. In the
next signal-box the man on duty heard the eight rings in this
particular order, and, to his ears, they carried the very plain
message:</p>

<p>"Stop and examine train!"</p>

<p>Which he proceeded to do by keeping the home signal against
her.</p>

<p>"What's up?" cried the driver, as he stopped beside the box.</p>

<p>"Cherrington telephones you've got no tail light," shouted the
signalman.</p>

<p>Down jumped the guard and ran behind the train. The lamp was
there right enough, but out. He tried to light it, and swore at the
lampmen fifty miles behind him.</p>

<p>"Forgot to fill it!" he muttered.</p>

<p>In his van was a spare one. But it took several minutes before
it was fixed behind the train. Three men were anxious, and one of
them shouted out of the window to the front guard, with a foreign
accent:</p>

<p>"Why do we stop?"</p>

<p>"All right, sir; we're just off."</p>

<p>"We shall be late at Melfield?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I'm afraid we shall."</p>

<p>"A sovereign if we're in time."</p>

<p>"Hope we shall be, then," said the guard; "but it doesn't rest
with me. Right away, George! Try your best, and it's shares."</p>

<p>For he guessed the driver had overheard. But, at Slade Junction
box, a cross-country express, well up to time, got the road on to
Melfield first, and the London train steamed in thirteen minutes
late. For the second time that night three men failed to get to
Porthaven, and perhaps they guessed it was not pure accident.</p>

<p>On Friday Brett saw Colonel Sibthorpe.</p>

<p>"Well," said the latter, "he got off all right. I suppose the
coast was clear after all?"</p>

<p>"I rather fancy I made it clear for him," replied Brett, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>He drew a gimlet from his pocket and showed it to the Colonel.
"With this, sir."</p>

<p>And he proceeded to explain.</p>
