<h1>The Past</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Ellen Glasgow</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>I had no sooner entered the house than I knew something was wrong.
Though I had never been in so splendid a place before--it was one of
those big houses just off Fifth Avenue--I had a suspicion from the
first that the magnificence covered a secret disturbance. I was
always quick to receive impressions, and when the black iron doors
swung together behind me, I felt as if I were shut inside a
prison.</p>

<p>When I gave my name and explained that I was the new secretary, I
was delivered into the charge of an elderly lady's-maid, who looked
as if she had been crying. Without speaking a word, though she nodded
kindly enough, she led me down the hall, and then up a flight of
stairs at the back of the house to a pleasant bedroom in the third
storey. There was a great deal of sunshine, and the walls, which were
painted a soft yellow, made the room very cheerful. It would be a
comfortable place to sit in when I was not working, I thought, while
the sad-faced maid stood watching me remove my wraps and hat.</p>

<p>"If you are not tired, Mrs. Vanderbridge would like to dictate a
few letters," she said presently, and they were the first words she
had spoken.</p>

<p>"I am not a bit tired. Will you take me to her?" One of the
reasons, I knew, which had decided Mrs. Vanderbridge to engage me was
the remarkable similarity of our handwriting. We were both
Southerners, and though she was now famous on two continents for her
beauty, I couldn't forget that she had got her early education at the
little academy for young ladies in Fredericksburg. This was a bond of
sympathy in my thoughts at least, and, heaven knows, I needed to
remember it while I followed the maid down the narrow stairs and
along the wide hall to the front of the house.</p>

<p>In looking back after a year, I can recall every detail of that
first meeting. Though it was barely four o'clock, the electric lamps
were turned on in the hall, and I can still see the mellow light that
shone over the staircase and lay in pools on the old pink rugs, which
were so soft and fine that I felt as if I were walking on flowers. I
remember the sound of music from a room somewhere on the first floor,
and the scent of lilies and hyacinths that drifted from the
conservatory. I remember it all, every note of music, every whiff of
fragrance; but most vividly I remember Mrs. Vanderbridge as she
looked round, when the door opened, from the wood fire into which she
had been gazing. Her eyes caught me first. They were so wonderful
that for a moment I couldn't see anything else; then I took in slowly
the dark red of her hair, the clear pallor of her skin, and the long,
flowing lines of her figure in a tea-gown of blue silk. There was a
white bearskin rug under her feet, and while she stood there before
the wood fire, she looked as if she had absorbed the beauty and
colour of the house as a crystal vase absorbs the light. Only when
she spoke to me, and I went nearer, did I detect the heaviness
beneath her eyes and the nervous quiver of her mouth, which drooped a
little at the corners. Tired and worn as she was, I never saw her
afterwards--not even when she was dressed for the opera--look quite
so lovely, so much like an exquisite flower, as she did on that first
afternoon. When I knew her better, I discovered that she was a
changeable beauty; there were days when all the colour seemed to go
out of her, and she looked dull and haggard; but at her best no one
I've ever seen could compare with her.</p>

<p>She asked me a few questions, and though she was pleasant and
kind, I knew that she scarcely listened to my responses. While I sat
down at the desk and dipped my pen into the ink, she flung herself on
the couch before the fire with a movement which struck me as
hopeless. I saw her feet tap the white fur rug, while she plucked
nervously at the lace on the end of one of the gold-coloured sofa
pillows. For an instant the thought flashed through my mind that she
had been taking something--drug of some sort--and that she was
suffering now from the effects of it. Then she looked at me steadily,
almost as if she were reading my thoughts, and I knew that I was
wrong. Her large radiant eyes were as innocent as a child's.</p>

<p>She dictated a few notes-all declining invitations--and then,
while I still waited pen in hand, she sat up on the couch with one of
her quick movements, and said in a low voice, "I am not dining out
to-night, Miss Wrenn. I am not well enough."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for that." It was all I could think of to say, for I
did not understand why she should have told me.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, I should like you to come down to dinner.
There will be only Mr. Vanderbridge and myself."</p>

<p>"Of course I will come if you wish it." I couldn't very well
refuse to do what she asked me, yet I told myself, while I answered,
that if I had known she expected me to make one of the family, I
should never, not even at twice the salary, have taken the place. It
didn't take me a minute to go over my slender wardrobe in my mind and
realize that I had nothing to wear that would look well enough.</p>

<p>"I can see you don't like it," she added after a moment, almost
wistfully, "but it won't be often. It is only when we are dining
alone."</p>

<p>This, I thought, was even queerer than the request--or
command--for I knew from her tone, just as plainly as if she had told
me in words, that she did not wish to dine alone with her
husband.</p>

<p>"I am ready to help you in any way--in any way that I can," I
replied, and I was so deeply moved by her appeal that my voice broke
in spite of my effort to control it. After my lonely life I dare say
I should have loved any one who really needed me, and from the first
moment that I read the appeal in Mrs. Vanderbridge's face I felt that
I was willing to work my fingers to the bone for her. Nothing that
she asked of me was too much when she asked it in that voice, with
that look.</p>

<p>"I am glad you are nice," she said, and for the first time she
smiled--a charming, girlish smile with a hint of archness. "We shall
get on beautifully, I know, because I can talk to you. My last
secretary was English, and I frightened her almost to death whenever
I tried to talk to her." Then her tone grew serious. "You won't mind
dining with us. Roger--Mr. Vanderbridge--is the most charming man in
the world."</p>

<p>"Is that his picture?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the one in the Florentine frame. The other is my brother. Do
you think we are alike?"</p>

<p>"Since you've told me, I notice a likeness." Already I had picked
up the Florentine frame from the desk, and was eagerly searching the
features of Mr. Vanderbridge. It was an arresting face, dark,
thoughtful, strangely appealing, and picturesque--though this may
have been due, of course, to the photographer. The more I looked at
it, the more there grew upon me an uncanny feeling of familiarity;
but not until the next day, while I was still trying to account for
the impression that I had seen the picture before, did there flash
into my mind the memory of an old portrait of a Florentine nobleman
in a loan collection last winter. I can't remember the name of the
painter--I am not sure that it was known--but this photograph might
have been taken from the painting. There was the same imaginative
sadness in both faces, the same haunting beauty of feature, and one
surmised that there must be the same rich darkness of colouring. The
only striking difference was that the man in the photograph looked
much older than the original of the portrait, and I remembered that
the lady who had engaged me was the second wife of Mr. Vanderbridge
and some ten or fifteen years younger, I had heard, than her
husband.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen a more wonderful face?" asked Mrs.
Vanderbridge. "Doesn't he look as if he might have been painted by
Titian?"</p>

<p>"Is he really so handsome as that?"</p>

<p>"He is a little older and sadder, that is all. When we were
married it was exactly like him." For an instant she hesitated and
then broke out almost bitterly, "Isn't that a face any woman might
fall in love with, a face any woman-living or dead-would not be
willing to give up?"</p>

<p>Poor child, I could see that she was overwrought and needed
someone to talk to, but it seemed queer to me that she should speak
so frankly to a stranger. I wondered why any one so rich and so
beautiful should ever be unhappy--for I had been schooled by poverty
to believe that money is the first essential of happiness--and yet
her unhappiness was as evident as her beauty, or the luxury that
enveloped her. At that instant I felt that I hated Mr. Vanderbridge,
for whatever the secret tragedy of their marriage might be, I
instinctively knew that the fault was not on the side of the wife.
She was as sweet and winning as if she were still the reigning beauty
in the academy for young ladies. I knew with a knowledge deeper than
any conviction that she was not to blame, and if she wasn't to blame,
then who under heaven could be at fault except her husband?</p>

<p>In a few minutes a friend came in to tea, and I went upstairs to
my room, and unpacked the blue taffeta dress I had bought for my
sister's wedding. I was still doubtfully regarding it when there was
a knock at my door, and the maid with the sad face came in to bring
me a pot of tea. After she had placed the tray on the table, she
stood nervously twisting a napkin in her hands while she waited for
me to leave my unpacking and sit down in the easy chair she had drawn
up under the lamp.</p>

<p>"How do you think Mrs. Vanderbridge is looking?" she asked
abruptly in a voice that held a breathless note of suspense. Her
nervousness and the queer look in her face made me stare at her
sharply. This was a house, I was beginning to feel, where everybody,
from the mistress down, wanted to question me. Even the silent maid
had found voice for interrogation.</p>

<p>"I think her the loveliest person I've ever seen," I answered
after a moment's hesitation. There couldn't be any harm in telling
her how much I admired her mistress.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is lovely--everyone thinks so--and her nature is as
sweet as her face." She was becoming loquacious. "I have never had a
lady who was so sweet and kind. She hasn't always been rich, and that
may be the reason she never seems to grow hard and selfish, the
reason she spends so much of her life thinking of other people. It's
been six years now, ever since her marriage, that I've lived with
her, and in all that time I've never had a cross word from her."</p>

<p>"One can see that. With everything she has she ought to be as
happy as the day is long."</p>

<p>"She ought to be." Her voice dropped, and I saw her glance
suspiciously at the door, which she had closed when she entered. "She
ought to be, but she isn't. I have never seen any one so unhappy as
she has been of late--ever since last summer. I suppose I oughtn't to
talk about it, but I've kept it to myself so long that I feel as if
it was killing me. If she was my own sister, I couldn't be any fonder
of her, and yet I have to see her suffer day after day, and not say a
word--not even to her. She isn't the sort of lady you could speak to
about a thing like that."</p>

<p>She broke down, and dropping on the rug at my feet, hid her face
in her hands. It was plain that she was suffering acutely, and while
I patted her shoulder, I thought what a wonderful mistress Mrs.
Vanderbridge must be to have attached a servant to her so
strongly.</p>

<p>"You must remember that I am a stranger in the house, that I
scarcely know her, that I've never so much as laid eyes on her
husband," I said warningly, for I've always avoided, as far as
possible, the confidences of servants.</p>

<p>"But you look as if you could be trusted." The maid's nerves, as
well as the mistress's, were on edge, I could see. "And she needs
somebody who can help her. She needs a real friend-somebody who will
stand by her no matter what happens." Again, as in the room
downstairs, there flashed through my mind the suspicion that I had
got into a place where people took drugs or drink--or were all out of
their minds. I had heard of such houses.</p>

<p>"How can I help her? She won't confide in me, and even if she did,
what could I do for her?"</p>

<p>"You can stand by and watch. You can come between her and harm--if
you see it." She had risen from the floor and stood wiping her
reddened eyes on the napkin. "I don't know what it is, but I know it
is there. I feel it even when I can't see it."</p>

<p>Yes, they were all out of their minds; there couldn't be any other
explanation. The whole episode was incredible. It was the kind of
thing, I kept telling myself, that did not happen. Even in a book
nobody could believe it.</p>

<p>"But her husband? He is the one who must protect her."</p>

<p>She gave me a blighting look. "He would if he could. He isn't to
blame--you mustn't think that. He is one of the best men in the
world, but he can't help her. He can't help her because he doesn't
know. He doesn't see it."</p>

<p>A bell rang somewhere, and catching up the tea-tray, she paused
just long enough to throw me a pleading word, "Stand between her and
harm, if you see it."</p>

<p>When she had gone I locked the door after her, and turned on all
the lights in the room. Was there really a tragic mystery in the
house, or were they all mad, as I had first imagined? The feeling of
apprehension, of vague uneasiness, which had come to me when I
entered the iron doors, swept over me in a wave while I sat there in
the soft glow of the shaded electric light. Something was wrong.
Somebody was making that lovely woman unhappy, and who, in the name
of reason, could this somebody be except her husband? Yet the maid
had spoken of him as "one of the best men in the world," and it was
impossible to doubt the tearful sincerity of her voice. Well, the
riddle was too much for me. I gave it up at last with a
sigh--dreading the hour that would call me downstairs to meet Mr.
Vanderbridge. I felt in every nerve and fibre of my body that I
should hate him the moment I looked at him.</p>

<p>But at eight o'clock, when I went reluctantly downstairs, I had a
surprise. Nothing could have been kinder than the way Mr.
Vanderbridge greeted me, and I could tell as soon as I met his eyes
that there wasn't anything vicious or violent in his nature. He
reminded me more than ever of the portrait in the loan collection,
and though he was so much older than the Florentine nobleman, he had
the same thoughtful look. Of course I am not an artist, but I have
always tried, in my way, to be a reader of personality; and it didn't
take a particularly keen observer to discern the character and
intellect in Mr. Vanderbridge's face. Even now I remember it as the
noblest face I have ever seen; and unless I had possessed at least a
shade of penetration, I doubt if I should have detected the
melancholy. For it was only when he was thinking deeply that this
sadness seemed to spread like a veil over his features. At other
times he was cheerful and even gay in his manner; and his rich dark
eyes would light up now and then with irrepressible humour. From the
way he looked at his wife I could tell that there was no lack of love
or tenderness on his side any more than there was on hers. It was
obvious that he was still as much in love with her as he had been
before his marriage, and my immediate perception of this only
deepened the mystery that enveloped them. If the fault wasn't his and
wasn't hers, then who was responsible for the shadow that hung over
the house?</p>

<p>For the shadow was there. I could feel it, vague and dark, while
we talked about the war and the remote possibilities of peace in the
spring. Mrs. Vanderbridge looked young and lovely in her gown of
white satin with pearls on her bosom, but her violet eyes were almost
black in the candlelight, and I had a curious feeling that this
blackness was the colour of thought. Something troubled her to
despair, yet I was as positive as I could be of anything I had ever
been told that she had breathed no word of this anxiety or distress
to her husband. Devoted as they were, a nameless dread, fear, or
apprehension divided them. It was the thing I had felt from the
moment I entered the house; the thing I had heard in the tearful
voice of the maid. One could scarcely call it horror, because it was
too vague, too impalpable, for so vivid a name; yet, after all these
quiet months, horror is the only word I can think of that in any way
expresses the emotion which pervaded the house.</p>

<p>I had never seen so beautiful a dinner table, and I was gazing
with pleasure at the damask and glass and silver--there was a silver
basket of chrysanthemums, I remember, in the centre of the
table--when I noticed a nervous movement of Mrs. Vanderbridge's head,
and saw her glance hastily towards the door and the staircase beyond.
We had been talking animatedly, and as Mrs. Vanderbridge turned away,
I had just made a remark to her husband, who appeared to have fallen
into a sudden fit of abstraction, and was gazing thoughtfully over
his soup-plate at the white and yellow chrysanthemums. It occurred to
me, while I watched him, that he was probably absorbed in some
financial problem, and I regretted that I had been so careless as to
speak to him. To my surprise, however, he replied immediately in a
natural tone, and I saw, or imagined that I saw, Mrs. Vanderbridge
throw me a glance of gratitude and relief. I can't remember what we
were talking about, but I recall perfectly that the conversation kept
up pleasantly, without a break, until dinner was almost half over.
The roast had been served, and I was in the act of helping myself to
potatoes, when I became aware that Mr. Vanderbridge had again fallen
into his reverie. This time he scarcely seemed to hear his wife's
voice when she spoke to him, and I watched the sadness cloud his face
while he continued to stare straight ahead of him with a look that
was almost yearning in its intensity.</p>

<p>Again I saw Mrs. Vanderbridge, with her nervous gesture, glance in
the direction of the hall, and to my amazement, as she did so, a
woman's figure glided noiselessly over the old Persian rug at the
door, and entered the dining-room. I was wondering why no one spoke
to her, why she spoke to no one, when I saw her sink into a chair on
the other side of Mr. Vanderbridge and unfold her napkin. She was
quite young, younger even than Mrs. Vanderbridge, and though she was
not really beautiful, she was the most graceful creature I had ever
imagined. Her dress was of grey stuff, softer and more clinging than
silk, and of a peculiar misty texture and colour, and her parted hair
lay like twilight on either side of her forehead. She was not like
any one I had ever seen before--she appeared so much frailer, so much
more elusive, as if she would vanish if you touched her. I can't
describe, even months afterwards, the singular way in which she
attracted and repelled me.</p>

<p>At first I glanced inquiringly at Mrs. Vanderbridge, hoping that
she would introduce me, but she went on talking rapidly in an
intense, quivering voice, without noticing the presence of her guest
by so much as the lifting of her eyelashes. Mr. Vanderbridge still
sat there, silent and detached, and all the time the eyes of the
stranger--starry eyes with a mist over them--looked straight through
me at the tapestried wall at my back. I knew she didn't see me and
that it wouldn't have made the slightest difference to her if she had
seen me. In spite of her grace and her girlishness I did not like
her, and I felt that this aversion was not on my side alone. I do not
know how I received the impression that she hated Mrs.
Vanderbridge--never once had she glanced in her direction--yet I was
aware, from the moment of her entrance, that she was bristling with
animosity, though animosity is too strong a word for the resentful
spite, like the jealous rage of a spoiled child, which gleamed now
and then in her eyes. I couldn't think of her as wicked any more than
I could think of a bad child as wicked. She was merely wilful and
undisciplined and--I hardly know how to convey what I
mean--selfish.</p>

<p>After her entrance the dinner dragged on heavily. Mrs.
Vanderbridge still kept up her nervous chatter, but nobody listened,
for I was too embarrassed to pay any attention to what she said, and
Mr. Vanderbridge had never recovered from his abstraction. He was
like a man in a dream, not observing a thing that happened before
him, while the strange woman sat there in the candlelight with her
curious look of vagueness and unreality. To my astonishment not even
the servants appeared to notice her, and though she had unfolded her
napkin when she sat down, she wasn't served with either the roast or
the salad. Once or twice, particularly when a new course was served,
I glanced at Mrs. Vanderbridge to see if she would rectify the
mistake, but she kept her gaze fixed on her plate. It was just as if
there were a conspiracy to ignore the presence of the stranger,
though she had been, from the moment of her entrance, the dominant
figure at the table. You tried to pretend she wasn't there, and yet
you knew--you knew vividly that she was gazing insolently straight
through you.</p>

<p>The dinner lasted, it seemed, for hours, and you may imagine my
relief when at last Mrs. Vanderbridge rose and led the way back into
the drawing-room. At first I thought the stranger would follow us,
but when I glanced round from the hall she was still sitting there
beside Mr. Vanderbridge, who was smoking a cigar with his coffee.</p>

<p>"Usually he takes his coffee with me," said Mrs. Vanderbridge,
"but tonight he has things to think over."</p>

<p>"I thought he seemed absent-minded."</p>

<p>"You noticed it, then?" She turned to me with her straightforward
glance, "I always wonder how much strangers notice. He hadn't been
well of late, and he has these spells of depression. Nerves are
dreadful things, aren't they?"</p>

<p>I laughed. "So I've heard, but I've never been able to afford
them."</p>

<p>"Well, they do cost a great deal, don't they?" She had a trick of
ending her sentences with a question, "I hope your room is
comfortable, and that you don't feel timid about being alone on that
floor. If you haven't nerves, you can't get nervous, can you?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't get nervous." Yet while I spoke, I was conscious of a
shiver deep down in me, as if my senses reacted again to the dread
that permeated the atmosphere.</p>

<p>As soon as I could, I escaped to my room, and I was sitting there
over a book, when the maid--her name was Hopkins, I had
discovered--came in on the pretext of inquiring if I had everything I
needed. One of the innumerable servants had already turned down my
bed, so when Hopkins appeared at the door, I suspected at once that
there was a hidden motive underlying her ostensible purpose.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vanderbridge told me to look after you," she began. "She is
afraid you will be lonely until you learn the way of things."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not lonely," I answered. "I've never had time to be
lonely."</p>

<p>"I used to be like that; but time hangs heavy on my hands now.
That's why I've taken to knitting." She held out a grey yarn muffler.
"I had an operation a year ago, and since then Mrs. Vanderbridge has
had another maid--a French one--to sit up for her at night and
undress her. She is always so fearful of overtaxing us, though there
isn't really enough work for two lady's maids, because she is so
thoughtful that she never gives any trouble if she can help it."</p>

<p>"It must be nice to be rich," I said idly, as I turned a page of
my book. Then I added almost before I realized what I was saying,
"The other lady doesn't look as if she had so much money."</p>

<p>Her face turned paler if that were possible, and for a minute I
thought she was going to faint. "The other lady?"</p>

<p>"I mean the one who came down late to dinner--the one in the grey
dress. She wore no jewels, and her dress wasn't low in the neck."</p>

<p>"Then you saw her?" There was a curious flicker in her face as if
her pallor came and went.</p>

<p>"We were at the table when she came in. Has Mr. Vanderbridge a
secretary who lives in the house?"</p>

<p>"No, he hasn't a secretary except at his office. When he wants one
at the house, he telephones to his office."</p>

<p>"I wondered why she came, for she didn't eat any dinner, and
nobody spoke to her--not even Mr. Vanderbridge."</p>

<p>"Oh, he never speaks to her. Thank God, it hasn't come to that
yet."</p>

<p>"Then why does she come? It must be dreadful to be treated like
that, and before the servants, too. Does she come often?"</p>

<p>"There are months and months when she doesn't. I can always tell
by the way Mrs. Vanderbridge picks up. You wouldn't know her, she is
so full of life--the very picture of happiness. Then one evening
she--the Other One, I mean--comes back again, just as she did
to-night, just as she did last summer, and it all begins over from
the beginning."</p>

<p>"But can't they keep her out--the Other One? Why do they let her
in?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vanderbridge tries hard. She tries all she can every minute.
You saw her to-night?"</p>

<p>"And Mr. Vanderbridge? Can't he help her?"</p>

<p>She shook her head with an ominous gesture. "He doesn't know."</p>

<p>"He doesn't know she is there? Why, she was close by him. She
never took her eyes off him except when she was staring through me at
the wall."</p>

<p>"Oh, he knows she is there, but not in that way. He doesn't know
that any one else knows."</p>

<p>I gave it up, and after a minute she said in an oppressed voice,
"It seems strange that you should have seen her. I never have."</p>

<p>"But you know all about her."</p>

<p>"I know and I don't know. Mrs. Vanderbridge lets things drop
sometimes--she gets ill and feverish very easily--but she never tells
me anything outright. She isn't that sort."</p>

<p>"Haven't the servants told you about her--the Other One?"</p>

<p>At this, I thought, she seemed startled. "Oh, they don't know
anything to tell. They feel that something is wrong; that is why they
never stay longer than a week or two--we've had eight butlers since
autumn--but they never see what it is."</p>

<p>She stooped to pick up the ball of yarn which had rolled under my
chair. "If the time ever comes when you can stand between them, you
will do it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Between Mrs. Vanderbridge and the Other One?"</p>

<p>Her look answered me.</p>

<p>"You think, then, that she means harm to her?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Nobody knows--but she is killing her."</p>

<p>The clock struck ten, and I returned to my book with a yawn, while
Hopkins gathered up her work and went out, after wishing me a formal
goodnight. The odd part about our secret conferences was that as soon
as they were over, we began to pretend so elaborately to each other
that they had never been.</p>

<p>"I'll tell Mrs. Vanderbridge that you are very comfortable," was
the last remark Hopkins made before she sidled out of the door and
left me alone with the mystery. It was one of those situations--I am
obliged to repeat this over and over--that was too preposterous for
me to believe in even while I was surrounded and overwhelmed by its
reality. I didn't dare face what I thought, I didn't dare face even
what I felt; but I went to bed shivering in a warm room, while I
resolved passionately that if the chance ever came to me I would
stand between Mrs. Vanderbridge and this unknown evil that threatened
her.</p>

<p>In the morning Mrs. Vanderbridge went out shopping, and I did not
see her until the evening, when she passed me on the staircase as she
was going out to dinner and the opera. She was radiant in blue
velvet, with diamonds in her hair and at her throat, and I wondered
again how any one so lovely could ever be troubled.</p>

<p>"I hope you had a pleasant day, Miss Wrenn," she said kindly. "I
have been too busy to get off any letters, but to-morrow we shall
begin early." Then, as if from an afterthought, she looked back and
added, "There are some new novels in my sitting-room. You might care
to look over them."</p>

<p>When she had gone, I went upstairs to the sitting-room and turned
over the books, but I couldn't, to save my life, force an interest in
printed romances, after meeting Mrs. Vanderbridge and remembering the
mystery that surrounded her. I wondered if "the Other One," as
Hopkins called her, lived in the house, and I was still wondering
this when the maid came in and began putting the table to rights.</p>

<p>"Do they dine out often?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They used to, but since Mr. Vanderbridge hasn't been so well,
Mrs. Vanderbridge doesn't like to go without him. She only went
to-night because he begged her to."</p>

<p>She had barely finished speaking when the door opened, and Mr.
Vanderbridge came in and sat down in one of the big velvet chairs
before the wood fire. He had not noticed us, for one of his moods was
upon him, and I was about to slip out as noiselessly as I could when
I saw that the Other One was standing in the patch of firelight on
the hearthrug. I had not seen her come in, and Hopkins evidently was
still unaware of her presence, for while I was watching, I saw the
maid turn towards her with a fresh log for the fire. At the moment it
occurred to me that Hopkins must be either blind or drunk, for
without hesitating in her advance, she moved on the stranger, holding
the huge hickory log out in front of her. Then, before I could utter
a sound or stretch out a hand to stop her, I saw her walk straight
through the grey figure and carefully place the log on the
andirons.</p>

<p>So she isn't real, after all, she is merely a phantom, I found
myself thinking, as I fled from the room, and hurried along the hall
to the staircase. She is only a ghost, and nobody believes in ghosts
any longer. She is something that I know doesn't exist, yet even,
though she can't possibly be, I can swear that I have seen her. My
nerves were so shaken by the discovery that as soon as I reached my
room I sank in a heap on the rug, and it was here that Hopkins found
me a little later when she came to bring me an extra blanket.</p>

<p>"You looked so upset I thought you might have seen something," she
said. "Did anything happen while you were in the room?"</p>

<p>"She was there all the time--every blessed minute. You walked
right through her when you put the log on the fire. Is it possible
that you didn't see her?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't see anything out of the way." She was plainly
frightened. "Where was she standing?"</p>

<p>"On the hearthrug in front of Mr. Vanderbridge. To reach the fire
you had to walk straight through her, for she didn't move. She didn't
give way an inch."</p>

<p>"Oh, she never gives way. She never gives way living or dead."</p>

<p>This was more than human nature could stand.</p>

<p>"In heavens name," I cried irritably, "who is she?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" She appeared genuinely surprised. "Why, she is
the other Mrs. Vanderbridge. She died fifteen years ago, just a year
after they were married, and people say a scandal was hushed up about
her, which he never knew. She isn't a good sort, that's what I think
of her, though they say he almost worshipped her."</p>

<p>"And she still has this hold on him?"</p>

<p>"He can't shake it off, that's what's the matter with him, and if
it goes on, he will end his days in an asylum. You see, she was very
young, scarcely more than a girl, and he got the idea in his head
that it was marrying him that killed her. If you want to know what I
think, I believe she put it there for a purpose."</p>

<p>"You mean--?" I was so completely at sea that I couldn't frame a
rational question. "I mean she haunts him purposely in order to drive
him out of his mind. She was always that sort, jealous and exacting,
the kind that clutches and strangles a man, and I've often thought,
though I've no head for speculation, that we carry into the next
world the traits and feelings that have got the better of us in this
one. It seems to me only common sense to believe that we're obliged
to work them off somewhere until we are free of them. That is the way
my first lady used to talk, anyhow, and I've never found anybody that
could give me a more sensible idea."</p>

<p>"And isn't there any way to stop it? What has Mrs. Vanderbridge
done?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she can't do anything now. It has got beyond her, though she
has had doctor after doctor, and tried everything she could think of.
But, you see, she is handicapped because she can't mention it to her
husband. He doesn't know that she knows."</p>

<p>"And she won't tell him?"</p>

<p>"She is the sort that would die first--just the opposite from the
Other One--for she leaves him free, she never clutches and strangles.
It isn't her way." For a moment she hesitated, and then added
grimly--"I've wondered if you could do anything?"</p>

<p>"If I could? Why, I am a perfect stranger to them all."</p>

<p>"That's why I've been thinking it. Now, if you could corner her
some day--the Other One-and tell her up and down to her face what you
think of her."</p>

<p>The idea was so ludicrous that it made me laugh in spite of my
shaken nerves. "They would fancy me out of my wits! Imagine stopping
an apparition and telling it what you think of it!"</p>

<p>"Then you might try talking it over with Mrs. Vanderbridge. It
would help her to know that you see her also."</p>

<p>But the next morning, when I went down to Mrs. Vanderbridge's
room, I found that she was too ill to see me. At noon a trained nurse
came on the case, and for a week we took our meals together in the
morning-room upstairs. She appeared competent enough, but I am sure
that she didn't so much as suspect that there was anything wrong in
the house except the influenza which had attacked Mrs. Vanderbridge
the night of the opera. Never once during that week did I catch a
glimpse of the Other One, though I felt her presence whenever I left
my room and passed through the hall below. I knew all the time as
well as if I had seen her that she was hidden there, watching,
watching--</p>

<p>At the end of the week Mrs. Vanderbridge sent for me to write some
letters, and when I went into her room, I found her lying on the
couch with a tea-table in front of her. She asked me to make the tea
because she was still so weak, and I saw that she looked flushed and
feverish, and that her eyes were unnaturally large and bright. I
hoped she wouldn't talk to me, because people in that state are apt
to talk too much and then to blame the listener; but I had hardly
taken my seat at the tea-table before she said in a hoarse voice--the
cold had settled on her chest:</p>

<p>"Miss Wrenn, I have wanted to ask you ever since the other
evening--did you--did you see anything unusual at dinner? From your
face when you came out I thought--I thought--"</p>

<p>I met this squarely. "That I might have? Yes, I did see
something."</p>

<p>"You saw her?"</p>

<p>"I saw a woman come in and sit down at the table, and I wondered
why no one served her. I saw her quite distinctly."</p>

<p>"A small woman, thin and pale, in a grey dress?"</p>

<p>"She was so vague and--and misty, you know what I mean, that it is
hard to describe her; but I should know her again anywhere. She wore
her hair parted and drawn down over her ears. It was very dark and
fine--as fine as spun silk."</p>

<p>We were speaking in low voices, and unconsciously we had moved
closer together while my idle hands left the tea things.</p>

<p>"Then you know," she said earnestly, "that she really comes--that
I am not out of my mind--that it is not an hallucination?"</p>

<p>"I know that I saw her. I would swear to it. But doesn't Mr.
Vanderbridge see her also?"</p>

<p>"Not as we see her. He thinks that she is in his mind only." Then,
after an uncomfortable silence, she added suddenly, "She is really a
thought, you know. She is his thought of her--but he doesn't know
that she is visible to the rest of us."</p>

<p>"And he brings her back by thinking of her?"</p>

<p>She leaned nearer while a quiver passed over her features and the
flush deepened in her cheeks. "That is the only way she comes
back--the only way she has the power to come back--as a thought.
There are months and months when she leaves us in peace because he is
thinking of other things, but of late, since his illness, she has
been with him almost constantly." A sob broke from her, and she
buried her face in her hands. "I suppose she is always trying to
come--only she is too vague--and hasn't any form that we can see
except when he thinks of her as she used to look when she was alive.
His thought of her is like that, hurt and tragic and revengeful. You
see, he feels that he ruined her life because she died when the child
was coming--a month before it would have been born."</p>

<p>"And if he were to see her differently, would she change? Would
she cease to be revengeful if he stopped thinking her so?"</p>

<p>"God only knows. I've wondered and wondered how I might move her
to pity."</p>

<p>"Then you feel that she is really there? That she exists outside
of his mind?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell? What do any of us know of the world beyond? She
exists as much as I exist to you or you to me. Isn't thought all that
there is--all that we know?"</p>

<p>This was deeper than I could follow; but in order not to appear
stupid, I murmured sympathetically.</p>

<p>"And does she make him unhappy when she comes?"</p>

<p>"She is killing him--and me. I believe that is why she does
it."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that she could stay away? When he thinks of her
isn't she obliged to come back?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've asked that question over and over! In spite of his
calling her so unconsciously, I believe she comes of her own will, I
have always the feeling--it has never left me for an instant--that
she could appear differently if she would. I have studied her for
years until I know her like a book, and though she is only an
apparition, I am perfectly positive that she wills evil to us both.
Don't you think he would change that if he could? Don't you think he
would make her kind instead of vindictive if he had the power?"</p>

<p>"But if he could remember her as loving and tender?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I give it up--but it is killing me."</p>

<p>It was killing her. As the days passed I began to realize that she
had spoken the truth. I watched her bloom fade slowly and her lovely
features grow pinched and thin like the features of a starved person.
The harder she fought the apparition, the more I saw that the battle
was a losing one, and that she was only wasting her strength. So
impalpable yet so pervasive was the enemy that it was like fighting a
poisonous odour. There was nothing to wrestle with, and yet there was
everything. The struggle was wearing her out--was, as she had said,
actually "killing her"; but the physician who dosed her daily with
drugs--there was need now of a physician--had not the faintest idea
of the malady he was treating. In those dreadful days I think that
even Mr. Vanderbridge hadn't a suspicion of the truth. The past was
with him so constantly--he was so steeped in the memories of it--that
the present was scarcely more than a dream to him. It was, you see, a
reverse of the natural order of things; the thought had become more
vivid to his perceptions than any object. The phantom had been
victorious so far, and he was like a man recovering from the effects
of a narcotic. He was only half awake, only half alive to the events
through which he lived and the people who surrounded him. Oh, I
realize that I am telling my story badly!--that I am slurring over
the significant interludes! My mind has dealt so long with external
details that I have almost forgotten the words that express invisible
things. Though the phantom in the house was more real to me than the
bread I ate or the floor on which I trod, I can give you no
impression of the atmosphere in which we lived day after day--of the
suspense, of the dread of something we could not define, of the
brooding horror that seemed to lurk in the shadows of the firelight,
of the feeling always, day and night, that some unseen person was
watching us. How Mrs. Vanderbridge stood it without losing her reason
I have never known; and even now I am not sure that she could have
kept her reason if the end had not come when it did. That I
accidentally brought it about is one of the things in my life I am
most thankful to remember.</p>

<p>It was an afternoon in late winter, and I had just come up from
luncheon, when Mrs. Vanderbridge asked me to empty an old desk in one
of the upstairs rooms "I am sending all the furniture in that room
away," she said; "it was bought in a bad period, and I want to clear
it out and make room for the lovely things we picked up in Italy.
There is nothing in the desk worth saving except some old letters
from Mr. Vanderbridge's mother before her marriage."</p>

<p>I was glad that she could think of anything so practical as
furniture, and it was with relief that I followed her into the dim,
rather musty room over the library, where the windows were all
tightly closed. Years ago, Hopkins had once told me, the first Mrs.
Vanderbridge had used this room for a while, and after her death her
husband had been in the habit of shutting himself up alone here in
the evenings. This, I inferred, was the secret reason why my employer
was sending the furniture away. She had resolved to clear the house
of every association with the past.</p>

<p>For a few minutes we sorted the letters in the drawers of the
desk, and then, as I expected, Mrs. Vanderbridge became suddenly
bored by the task she had undertaken. She was subject to these
nervous reactions, and I was prepared for them even when they seized
her so spasmodically. I remember that she was in the very act of
glancing over an old letter when she rose impatiently, tossed it into
the fire unread, and picked up a magazine she had thrown down on a
chair.</p>

<p>"Go over them by yourself, Miss Wrenn," she said, and it was
characteristic of her nature that she should assume my
trustworthiness. "If anything seems worth saving you can file it--but
I'd rather die than have to wade through all this."</p>

<p>They were mostly personal letters, and while I went on, carefully
filing them, I thought how absurd it was of people to preserve so
many papers that were entirely without value. Mr. Vanderbridge I had
imagined to be a methodical man, and yet the disorder of the desk
produced a painful effect on my systematic temperament. The drawers
were filled with letters evidently unsorted, for now and then I came
upon a mass of business receipts and acknowledgements crammed in
among wedding invitations or letters from some elderly lady, who
wrote interminable pale epistles in the finest and most feminine of
Italian hands. That a man of Mr. Vanderbridge's wealth and position
should have been so careless about his correspondence amazed me until
I recalled the dark hints Hopkins had dropped in some of her midnight
conversations. Was it possible that he had actually lost his reason
for months after the death of his first wife, during that year when
he had shut himself alone with her memory? The question was still in
my mind when my eyes fell an the envelope in my hand, and I saw that
it was addressed to Mrs. Roger Vanderbridge. So this explained, in a
measure at least, the carelessness and the disorder! The desk was not
his, but hers, and after her death he had used it only during those
desperate months when he barely opened a letter. What he had done in
those long evenings when he sat alone here it was beyond me to
imagine. Was it any wonder that the brooding should have permanently
unbalanced his mind?</p>

<p>At the end of an hour I had sorted and filed the papers, with the
intention of asking Mrs. Vanderbridge if she wished me to destroy the
ones that seemed to be unimportant. The letters she had instructed me
to keep had not come to my hand, and I was about to give up the
search for them, when, in shaking the lock of one of the drawers, the
door of a secret compartment fell open, and I discovered a dark
object, which crumbled and dropped apart when I touched it. Bending
nearer, I saw that the crumbled mass had once been a bunch of
flowers, and that a streamer of purple ribbon still held together the
frail structure of wire and stems. In this drawer someone had hidden
a sacred treasure, and moved by a sense of romance and adventure, I
gathered the dust tenderly in tissue paper, and prepare to take it
downstairs to Mrs. Vanderbridge. It was not until then that some
letters tied loosely together with a silver cord caught my eye, and
while I picked them up, I remember thinking that they must be the
ones for which I had been looking so long. Then, as the cord broke in
my grasp and I gathered the letters from the lid of the desk, a word
or two flashed back at me through the torn edges of the envelopes,
and I realized that they were love letters written, I surmised, some
fifteen years ago, by Mr. Vanderbridge to his first wife.</p>

<p>"It may hurt her to see them," I thought, "but I don't dare
destroy them. There is nothing I can do except give them to her."</p>

<p>As I left the room, carrying the letters and the ashes of the
flowers, the idea of taking them to the husband instead of to the
wife flashed through my mind. Then--I think it was some jealous
feeling about the phantom that decided me--I quickened my steps to a
run down the staircase.</p>

<p>"They would bring her back. He would think of her more than ever,"
I told myself, "so he shall never see them. He shall never see them
if I can prevent it." I believe it occurred to me that Mrs.
Vanderbridge would be generous enough to give them to him--she was
capable of rising above her jealousy, I knew--but I determined that
she shouldn't do it until I had reasoned it out with her. "If
anything on earth would bring back the Other One for good; it would
be his seeing these old letters," I repeated as I hastened down the
hall.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderbridge was lying on the couch before the fire, and I
noticed at once that she had been crying. The drawn look in her sweet
face went to my heart, and I felt that I would do anything in the
world to comfort her. Though she had a book in her hand, I could see
that she had not been reading. The electric lamp on the table by her
side was already lighted, leaving the rest of the room in shadow, for
it was a grey day with a biting edge of snow in the air. It was all
very charming in the soft light; but as soon as I entered I had a
feeling of oppression that made me want to run out into the wind. If
you have ever lived in a haunted house--a house pervaded by an
unforgettable past--you will understand the sensation of melancholy
that crept over me the minute the shadows began to fall. It was not
in myself--of this I am sure, for I have naturally a cheerful
temperament--it was in the space that surrounded us and the air we
breathed.</p>

<p>I explained to her about the letters, and then, kneeling on the
rug in front of her, I emptied the dust of the flowers into the fire.
There was though I hate to confess it, a vindictive pleasure in
watching it melt into the flames; and at the moment I believe I could
have burned the apparition as thankfully. The more I saw of the Other
One, the more I found myself accepting Hopkins's judgment of her.
Yes, her behavior, living and dead, proved that she was not "a good
sort."</p>

<p>My eyes were still on the flames when a sound from Mrs.
Vanderbridge--half a sigh, half a sob--made me turn quickly and look
up at her.</p>

<p>"But this isn't his handwriting," she said in a puzzled tone.
"They are love letters, and they are to her--but they are not from
him." For a moment or two she was silent, and I heard the pages
rustle in her hands as she turned them impatiently. "They are not
from him," she repeated presently, with an exultant ring in her
voice. "They are written after her marriage, but they are from
another man." She was as sternly tragic as an avenging fate. "She
wasn't faithful to him while she lived. She wasn't faithful to him
even while he was hers--"</p>

<p>With a spring I had risen from my knees and was bending over
her.</p>

<p>"Then you can save him from her. You can win him back! You have
only to show him the letters, and he will believe."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have only to show him the letters." She was looking beyond
me into the dusky shadows of the firelight, as if she saw the Other
One standing there before her, "I have only to show him the letters,"
I knew now that she was not speaking to me, "and he will
believe."</p>

<p>"Her power over him will be broken," I cried out. "He will think
of her differently. Oh, don't you see? Can't you see? It is the only
way to make him think of her differently. It is the only way to break
for ever the thought that draws her back to him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see, it is the only way," she said slowly; and the words
were still on her lips when the door opened and Mr. Vanderbridge
entered.</p>

<p>"I came for a cup of tea," he began, and added with playful
tenderness, "What is the only way?"</p>

<p>It was the crucial moment, I realized--it was the hour of destiny
for these two--and while he sank wearily into a chair, I looked
imploringly at his wife and then at the letters lying scattered
loosely about her. If I had had my will I should have flung them at
him with a violence which would have startled him out of his
lethargy. Violence, I felt, was what he needed--violence, a storm,
tears, reproaches--all the things he would never get from his
wife.</p>

<p>For a minute or two she sat there, with the letters before her,
and watched him with her thoughtful and tender gaze. I knew from her
face, so lovely and yet so sad, that she was looking again at
invisible things--at the soul of the man she loved, not at the body.
She saw him, detached and spiritualized, and she saw also the Other
One--for while we waited I became slowly aware of the apparition in
the firelight--of the white face and the cloudy hair and the look of
animosity and bitterness in the eyes. Never before had I been so
profoundly convinced of the malignant will veiled by that thin
figure. It was as if the visible form were only a spiral of grey
smoke covering a sinister purpose.</p>

<p>"The only way," said Mrs. Vanderbridge, "is to fight fairly even
when one fights evil." Her voice was like a bell, and as she spoke,
she rose from the couch and stood there in her glowing beauty
confronting the pale ghost of the past. There was a light about her
that was almost unearthly--the light of triumph. The radiance of it
blinded me for an instant. It was like a flame, clearing the
atmosphere of all that was evil, of all that was poisonous and
deadly. She was looking directly at the phantom, and there was no
hate in her voice--there was only a great pity, a great sorrow and
sweetness.</p>

<p>"I can't fight you that way," she said, and I knew that for the
first time she had swept aside subterfuge and evasion, and was
speaking straight to the presence before her. "After all, you are
dead and I am living, and I cannot fight you that way. I give up
everything. I give him back to you. Nothing is mine that I cannot win
and keep fairly. Nothing is mine that belongs really to you."</p>

<p>Then, while Mr. Vanderbridge rose, with a start of fear, and came
towards her, she bent quickly, and flung the letters into the fire.
When he would have stooped to gather the unburned pages, her lovely
flowing body curved between his hands and the flames; and so
transparent, so ethereal she looked, that I saw--or imagined that I
saw--the firelight shine through her. "The only way, my dear, is the
right way," she said softly.</p>

<p>The next instant--I don't know to this day how or when it began--I
was aware that the apparition had drawn nearer, and that the dread
and fear, the evil purpose, were no longer a part of her. I saw her
clearly for a moment--saw her as I had never seen her before--young
and gentle and--yes, this is the only word for it--loving. It was
just as if a curse had turned into a blessing, for, while she stood
there, I had a curious sensation of being enfolded in a kind of
spiritual glow and comfort--only words are useless to describe the
feeling because it wasn't in the least like anything else I had ever
known in my life. It was light without heat, glow without light--and
yet it was none of these things. The nearest I can come to it is to
call it a sense of blessedness--of blessedness that made you at peace
with everything you had once hated.</p>

<p>Not until afterwards did I realize that it was the victory of good
over evil. Not until afterwards did I discover that Mrs. Vanderbridge
had triumphed over the past in the only way that she could triumph.
She had won, not by resisting, but by accepting; not by violence, but
by gentleness; not by grasping, but by renouncing. Oh, long, long
afterwards, I knew that she had robbed the phantom of power over her
by robbing it of hatred. She had changed the thought of the past, in
that lay her victory.</p>

<p>At the moment I did not understand this. I did not understand it
even when I looked again for the apparition in the firelight, and saw
that it had vanished. There was nothing there--nothing except the
pleasant flicker of light and shadow on the old Persian rug.</p>
