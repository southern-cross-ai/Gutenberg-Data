<h2>PART 1.</h2>

<h3>1.</h3>

<p>HAY, verbena and mignonette scented the languid July day. Large
strawberries, crimsoning through sprigs of mint, floated in a bowl
of pale yellow cup on the verandah table: an old Georgian bowl,
with complex reflections on polygonal flanks, engraved with the
Raycie arms between lions' heads. Now and again the gentlemen,
warned by a menacing hum, slapped their cheeks, their brows or
their bald crowns; but they did so as furtively as possible, for
Mr. Halston Raycie, on whose verandah they sat, would not admit
that there were mosquitoes at High Point.</p>

<p>The strawberries came from Mr. Raycie's kitchen garden; the
Georgian bowl came from his great-grandfather (father of the
Signer); the verandah was that of his country-house, which stood on
a height above the Sound, at a convenient driving distance from his
town house in Canal Street.</p>

<p>"Another glass, Commodore," said Mr. Raycie, shaking out a
cambric handkerchief the size of a table-cloth, and applying a
corner of it to his steaming brow.</p>

<p>Mr. Jameson Ledgely smiled and took another glass. He was known
as "the Commodore" among his intimates because of having been in
the Navy in his youth, and having taken part, as a midshipman under
Admiral Porter, in the war of 1812. This jolly sunburnt bachelor,
whose face resembled that of one of the bronze idols he might have
brought back with him, had kept his naval air, though long retired
from the service; and his white duck trousers, his gold-braided cap
and shining teeth, still made him look as if he might be in command
of a frigate. Instead of that, he had just sailed over a party of
friends from his own place on the Long Island shore; and his trim
white sloop was now lying in the bay below the point.</p>

<p>The Halston Raycie house overlooked a lawn sloping to the Sound.
The lawn was Mr. Raycie's pride: it was mown with a scythe once a
fortnight, and rolled in the spring by an old white horse specially
shod for the purpose. Below the verandah the turf was broken by
three round beds of rose-geranium, heliotrope and Bengal roses,
which Mrs. Raycie tended in gauntlet gloves, under a small hinged
sunshade that folded back on its carved ivory handle. The house,
remodelled and enlarged by Mr. Raycie on his marriage, had played a
part in the Revolutionary war as the settler's cottage were
Benedict Arnold had had his headquarters. A contemporary print of
it hung in Mr. Raycie's study; but no one could have detected the
humble outline of the old house in the majestic stone-coloured
dwelling built of tongued-and-grooved boards, with an angle tower,
tall narrow windows, and a verandah on chamfered posts, that
figured so confidently as a "Tuscan Villa" in Downing's "Landscape
Gardening in America." There was the same difference between the
rude lithograph of the earlier house and the fine steel engraving
of its successor (with a "specimen" weeping beech on the lawn) as
between the buildings themselves. Mr. Raycie had reason to think
well of his architect.</p>

<p>He thought well of most things related to himself by ties of
blood or interest. No one had ever been quite sure that he made
Mrs. Raycie happy, but he was known to have the highest opinion of
her. So it was with his daughters, Sarah Anne and Mary Adeline,
fresher replicas of the lymphatic Mrs. Raycie; no one would have
sworn that they were quite at ease with their genial parent, yet
every one knew how loud he was in their praises. But the most
remarkable object within the range of Mr. Raycie's self-approval
was his son Lewis. And yet, as Jameson Ledgely, who was given to
speaking his mind, had once observed, you wouldn't have supposed
young Lewis was exactly the kind of craft Halston would have turned
out if he'd had the designing of his son and heir.</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie was a monumental man. His extent in height, width and
thickness was so nearly the same that whichever way he was turned
one had an almost equally broad view of him; and every inch of that
mighty circumference was so exquisitely cared for that to a
farmer's eye he might have suggested a great agricultural estate of
which not an acre is untilled. Even his baldness, which was in
proportion to the rest, looked as if it received a special daily
polish; and on a hot day his whole person was like some wonderful
example of the costliest irrigation. There was so much of him, and
he had so many planes, that it was fascinating to watch each runnel
of moisture follow its own particular watershed. Even on his large
fresh-looking hands the drops divided, trickling in different ways
from the ridges of the fingers; and as for his forehead and
temples, and the raised cushion of cheek beneath each of his lower
lids, every one of these slopes had its own particular stream, its
hollow pools and sudden cataracts; and the sight was never
unpleasant, because his whole vast bubbling surface was of such a
clean and hearty pink, and the exuding moisture so perceptibly
flavoured with expensive eau de Cologne and the best French
soap.</p>

<p>Mrs. Raycie, though built on a less heroic scale, had a pale
amplitude which, when she put on her best watered silk (the kind
that stood alone), and framed her countenance in the innumerable
blonde lace ruffles and clustered purple grapes of her newest Paris
cap, almost balanced her husband's bulk. Yet from this full-rigged
pair, as the Commodore would have put it, had issued the lean
little runt of a Lewis, a shrimp of a baby, a shaver of a boy, and
now a youth as scant as an ordinary man's midday shadow.</p>

<p>All these things, Lewis himself mused, dangling his legs from
the verandah rail, were undoubtedly passing through the minds of
the four gentlemen grouped about his father's bowl of cup.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Huzzard, the banker, a tall broad man, who looked big
in any company but Mr. Raycie's, leaned back, lifted his glass, and
bowed to Lewis.</p>

<p>"Here's to the Grand Tour!"</p>

<p>"Don't perch on that rail like a sparrow, my boy," Mr. Raycie
said reprovingly; and Lewis dropped to his feet, and returned Mr.
Huzzard's bow.</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking," he stammered. It was his too frequent
excuse.</p>

<p>Mr. Ambrose Huzzard, the banker's younger brother, Mr. Ledgely
and Mr. Donaldson Kent, all raised their glasses and cheerily
echoed: "The Grand Tour!"</p>

<p>Lewis bowed again, and put his lips to the glass he had
forgotten. In reality, he had eyes only for Mr. Donaldson Kent, his
father's cousin, a silent man with a lean hawk-like profile, who
looked like a retired Revolutionary hero, and lived in daily fear
of the most trifling risk or responsibility.</p>

<p>To this prudent and circumspect citizen had come, some years
earlier, the unexpected and altogether inexcusable demand that he
should look after the daughter of his only brother, Julius Kent.
Julius had died in Italy&mdash;well, that was his own business, if
he chose to live there. But to let his wife die before him, and to
leave a minor daughter, and a will entrusting her to the
guardianship of his esteemed elder brother, Donaldson Kent Esquire,
of Kent's Point, Long Island, and Great Jones Street, New
York&mdash;well, as Mr. Kent himself said, and as his wife said for
him, there had never been anything, anything whatever, in Mr.
Kent's attitude or behaviour, to justify the ungrateful Julius
(whose debts he had more than once paid) in laying on him this
final burden.</p>

<p>The girl came. She was fourteen, she was considered plain, she
was small and black and skinny. Her name was Beatrice, which was
bad enough, and made worse by the fact that it had been shortened
by ignorant foreigners to Treeshy. But she was eager, serviceable,
and good-tempered, and as Mr. and Mrs. Kent's friends pointed out,
her plainness made everything easy. There were two Kent boys
growing up, Bill and Donald; and if this penniless cousin had been
compounded of cream and roses&mdash;well, she would have taken more
watching, and might have rewarded the kindness of her uncle and
aunt by some act of wicked ingratitude. But this risk being
obviated by her appearance, they could be goodnatured to her
without afterthought, and to be goodnatured was natural to them. So
as the years passed, she gradually became the guardian of her
guardians; since it was equally natural to Mr. and Mrs. Kent to
throw themselves in helpless reliance on every one whom they did
not nervously fear or mistrust.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's off on Monday," Mr. Raycie said, nodding sharply at
Lewis, who had set down his glass after one sip. "Empty it, you
shirk!" the nod commanded; and Lewis, throwing back his head,
gulped down the draught, though it almost stuck in his lean throat.
He had already had to take two glasses, and even this scant
conviviality was too much for him, and likely to result in a mood
of excited volubility, followed by a morose evening and a head the
next morning. And he wanted to keep his mind clear that day, and to
think steadily and lucidly of Treeshy Kent.</p>

<p>Of course he couldn't marry her&mdash;yet. He was twenty-one
that very day, and still entirely dependent on his father. And he
wasn't altogether sorry to be going first on this Grand Tour. It
was what he had always dreamed of, pined for, from the moment when
his infant eyes had first been drawn to the prints of the European
cities in the long upper passage that smelt of matting. And all
that Treeshy had told him about Italy had confirmed and intensified
the longing. Oh, to have been going there with her&mdash;with her
as his guide, his Beatrice! (For she had given him a little Dante
of her father's, with a steel-engraved frontispiece of Beatrice;
and his sister Mary Adeline, who had been taught Italian by one of
the romantic Milanese exiles, had helped her brother out with the
grammar.)</p>

<p>The thought of going to Italy with Treeshy was only a dream; but
later, as man and wife, they would return there, and by that time,
perhaps, it was Lewis who would be her guide, and reveal to her the
historic marvels of her birthplace, of which after all she knew so
little, except in minor domestic ways that were quaint but
unimportant.</p>

<p>The prospect swelled her suitor's bosom, and reconciled him to
the idea of their separation. After all, he secretly felt himself
to be still a boy, and it was as a man that he would return: he
meant to tell her that when they met the next day. When he came
back his character would be formed, his knowledge of life (which he
already thought considerable) would be complete; and then no one
could keep them apart. He smiled in advance to think how little his
father's shouting and booming would impress a man on his return
from the Grand Tour...</p>

<p>The gentlemen were telling anecdotes about their own early
experiences in Europe. None of them&mdash;not even Mr.
Raycie&mdash;had travelled as extensively as it was intended that
Lewis should; but the two Huzzards had been twice to England on
banking matters, and Commodore Ledgely, a bold man, to France and
Belgium as well&mdash;not to speak of his early experiences in the
Far East. All three had kept a vivid and amused recollection
slightly tinged with disapprobation, of what they had
seen&mdash;"Oh, those French wenches," the Commodore chuckled
through his white teeth&mdash;but poor Mr. Kent, who had gone
abroad on his honeymoon, had been caught in Paris by the revolution
of 1830, had had the fever in Florence, and had nearly been
arrested as a spy in Vienna; and the only satisfactory episode in
this disastrous, and never repeated, adventure, had been the fact
of his having been mistaken for the Duke of Wellington (as he was
trying to slip out of a Viennese hotel in his courier's blue
surtout) by a crowd who had been&mdash;"Well, very gratifying in
their enthusiasm," Mr. Kent admitted.</p>

<p>"How my poor brother Julius could have lived in Europe! Well,
look at the consequences&mdash;" he used to say, as if poor
Treeshy's plainness gave an awful point to his moral.</p>

<p>"There's one thing in Paris, my boy, that you must be warned
against: those gambling-hells in the Pally Royle," Mr. Kent
insisted. "I never set foot in the places myself; but a glance at
the outside was enough."</p>

<p>"I knew a feller that was fleeced of a fortune there," Mr. Henry
Huzzard confirmed; while the Commodore, at his tenth glass,
chuckled with moist eyes: "The trollops, oh, the
trollops&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As for Vienna&mdash;" said Mr. Kent.</p>

<p>"Even in London," said Mr. Ambrose Huzzard, "a young man must be
on his look-out against gamblers. Every form of swindling is
practised, and the touts are always on the look-out for greenhorns;
a term," he added apologetically, "which they apply to any
traveller new to the country."</p>

<p>"In Paris," said Mr. Kent, "I was once within an ace of being
challenged to fight a duel." He fetched a sigh of horror and
relief, and glanced reassuredly down the Sound in the direction of
his own peaceful roof-tree.</p>

<p>"Oh, a duel," laughed the Commodore. "A man can fight duels
here. I fought a dozen when I was a young feller in New Erleens."
The Commodore's mother had been a southern lady, and after his
father's death had spent some years with her parents in Louisiana,
so that her son's varied experiences had begun early. "'Bout
women," he smiled confidentially, holding out his empty glass to
Mr. Raycie.</p>

<p>"The ladies&mdash;!" exclaimed Mr. Kent in a voice of
warning.</p>

<p>The gentlemen rose to their feet, the Commodore quite as
promptly and steadily as the others. The drawing-room window
opened, and from it emerged Mrs. Raycie, in a ruffled sarsenet
dress and Point de Paris cap, followed by her two daughters in
starched organdy with pink spencers. Mr. Raycie looked with proud
approval at his womenkind.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Mrs. Raycie, in a perfectly even voice,
"supper is on the table, and if you will do Mr. Raycie and myself
the favour&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The favour ma'am," said Mr. Ambrose Huzzard, "is on your side,
in so amiably inviting us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Raycie curtsied, the gentlemen bowed, and Mr. Raycie said:
"Your arm to Mrs. Raycie, Huzzard. This little farewell party is a
family affair, and the other gentlemen must content themselves with
my two daughters. Sarah Anne, Mary Adeline&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Commodore and Mr. John Huzzard advanced ceremoniously toward
the two girls, and Mr. Kent, being a cousin, closed the procession
between Mr. Raycie and Lewis.</p>

<p>Oh, that supper table! The vision of it used sometimes to rise
before Lewis Raycie's eyes in outlandish foreign places; for though
not a large or fastidious eater when he was at home, he was
afterward, in lands of chestnut-flour and garlic and queer bearded
sea-things, to suffer many pangs of hunger at the thought of that
opulent board. In the centre stood the Raycie epergne of pierced
silver, holding aloft a bunch of June roses surrounded by dangling
baskets of sugared almonds and striped peppermints; and grouped
about this decorative "motif" were Lowestoft platters heavy with
piles of raspberries, strawberries and the first Delaware peaches.
An outer flanking of heaped-up cookies, crullers, strawberry
short-cake, piping hot corn-bread and deep golden butter in moist
blocks still bedewed from the muslin swathings of the dairy, led
the eye to the Virginia ham in front of Mr. Raycie, and the twin
dishes of scrambled eggs on toast and broiled blue-fish over which
his wife presided. Lewis could never afterward fit into this
intricate pattern the "side-dishes" of devilled turkey-legs and
creamed chicken hash, the sliced cucumbers and tomatoes, the heavy
silver jugs of butter-coloured cream, the floating-island, "slips"
and lemon jellies that were somehow interwoven with the solider
elements of the design; but they were all there, either together or
successively, and so were the towering piles of waffles reeling on
their foundations, and the slender silver jugs of maple syrup
perpetually escorting them about the table as black Dinah
replenished the supply.</p>

<p>They ate&mdash;oh, how they all ate!&mdash;though the ladies
were supposed only to nibble; but the good things on Lewis's plate
remained untouched until, ever and again, an admonishing glance
from Mr. Raycie, or an entreating one from Mary Adeline, made him
insert a languid fork into the heap.</p>

<p>And all the while Mr. Raycie continued to hold forth.</p>

<p>"A young man, in my opinion, before setting up for himself, must
see the world; form his taste; fortify his judgment. He must study
the most famous monuments, examine the organization of foreign
societies, and the habits and customs of those older civilizations
whose yoke it has been our glory to cast off. Though he may see in
them much to deplore and to reprove&mdash;" ("Some of the gals,
though," Commodore Ledgely was heard to interject)&mdash;"much that
will make him give thanks for the privilege of having been born and
brought up under our own Free Institutions, yet I believe he will
also"&mdash;Mr. Raycie conceded it with magnanimity&mdash;"be able
to learn much."</p>

<p>"The Sundays, though," Mr. Kent hazarded warningly; and Mrs.
Raycie breathed across to her son: "Ah, that's what _I_ say!"</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie did not like interruption; and he met it by growing
visibly larger. His huge bulk hung a moment, like an avalanche,
above the silence which followed Mr. Kent's interjection and Mrs.
Raycie's murmur; then he crashed down on both.</p>

<p>"The Sundays&mdash;the Sundays? Well, what of the Sundays? What
is there to frighten a good Episcopalian in what we call the
Continental Sunday? I presume that we're all Churchmen here, eh? No
puling Methodists or atheistical Unitarians at my table tonight,
that I'm aware of? Nor will I offend the ladies of my household by
assuming that they have secretly lent an ear to the Baptist ranter
in the chapel at the foot of our lane. No? I thought not! Well,
then, I say, what's all this flutter about the Papists? Far be it
from me to approve of their heathenish doctrines&mdash;but, damn
it, they go to church, don't they? And they have a real service, as
we do, don't they? And real clergy, and not a lot of nondescripts
dressed like laymen, and damned badly at that, who chat familiarly
with the Almighty in their own vulgar lingo? No, sir"&mdash;he
swung about on the shrinking Mr. Kent&mdash;"it's not the Church
I'm afraid of in foreign countries, it's the sewers, sir!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Raycie had grown very pale: Lewis knew that she too was
deeply perturbed about the sewers. "And the night-air," she
scarce-audibly sighed.</p>

<p>But Mr. Raycie had taken up his main theme again. "In my
opinion, if a young man travels at all, he must travel as
extensively as his&mdash;er&mdash;means permit; must see as much of
the world as he can. Those are my son's sailing orders, Commodore;
and here's to his carrying them out to the best of his powers!"</p>

<p>Black Dinah, removing the Virginia ham, or rather such of its
bony structure as alone remained on the dish, had managed to make
room for a bowl of punch from which Mr. Raycie poured deep
ladlefuls of perfumed fire into the glasses ranged before him on a
silver tray. The gentlemen rose, the ladies smiled and wept, and
Lewis's health and the success of the Grand Tour were toasted with
an eloquence which caused Mr. Raycie, with a hasty nod to her
daughters, and a covering rustle of starched flounces, to shepherd
them softly from the room.</p>

<p>"After all," Lewis heard her murmur to them on the threshold,
"your father's using such language shows that he's in the best of
humour with dear Lewis."</p>

<h3>2.</h3>

<p>IN spite of his enforced potations, Lewis Raycie was up the next
morning before sunrise.</p>

<p>Unlatching his shutters without noise, he looked forth over the
wet lawn merged in a blur of shrubberies, and the waters of the
Sound dimly seen beneath a sky full of stars. His head ached but
his heart glowed; what was before him was thrilling enough to clear
a heavier brain than his.</p>

<p>He dressed quickly and completely (save for his shoes), and
then, stripping the flowered quilt from his high mahogany bed,
rolled it in a tight bundle under his arm. Thus enigmatically
equipped he was feeling his way, shoes in hand, through the
darkness of the upper story to the slippery oak stairs, when he was
startled by a candle-gleam in the pitch-blackness of the hall
below. He held his breath, and leaning over the stair-rail saw with
amazement his sister Mary Adeline come forth, cloaked and bonneted,
but also in stocking-feet, from the passage leading to the pantry.
She too carried a double burden: her shoes and the candle in one
hand, in the other a large covered basket that weighed down her
bare arm.</p>

<p>Brother and sister stopped and stared at each other in the blue
dusk: the upward slant of the candle-light distorted Mary Adeline's
mild features, twisting them into a frightened grin as Lewis stole
down to join her.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;" she whispered. "What in the world are you doing
here? I was just getting together a few things for that poor young
Mrs. Poe down the lane, who's so ill&mdash;before mother goes to
the store-room. You won't tell, will you?"</p>

<p>Lewis signalled his complicity, and cautiously slid open the
bolt of the front door. They durst not say more till they were out
of ear-shot. On the doorstep they sat down to put on their shoes;
then they hastened on without a word through the ghostly
shrubberies till they reached the gate into the lane.</p>

<p>"But you, Lewis?" the sister suddenly questioned, with an
astonished stare at the rolled-up quilt under her brother's
arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, I&mdash;. Look here Addy&mdash;" he broke off and began to
grope in his pocket&mdash;"I haven't much about me...the old
gentleman keeps me as close as ever...but here's a dollar, if you
think that poor Mrs. Poe could use it...I'd be too happy...consider
it a privilege..."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lewis, Lewis, how noble, how generous of you! Of course I
can buy a few extra things with it...they never see meat unless I
can bring them a bit, you know...and I fear she's dying of a
decline...and she and her mother are so fiery-proud..." She wept
with gratitude, and Lewis drew a breath of relief. He had diverted
her attention from the bed-quilt.</p>

<p>"Ah, there's the breeze," he murmured, sniffing the suddenly
chilled air.</p>

<p>"Yes; I must be off; I must be back before the sun is up," said
Mary Adeline anxiously, "and it would never do if mother
knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She doesn't know of your visits to Mrs. Poe?"</p>

<p>A look of childish guile sharpened Mary Adeline's undeveloped
face. "She DOES, of course; but yet she doesn't...we've arranged it
so. You see, Mr. Poe's an Atheist; and so father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see," Lewis nodded. "Well, we part here; I'm off for a swim,"
he said glibly. But abruptly he turned back and caught his sister's
arm. "Sister, tell Mrs. Poe, please, that I heard her husband give
a reading from his poems in New York two nights ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>("Oh, Lewis&mdash;YOU? But father says he's a blasphemer!")</p>

<p>"&mdash;And that he's a great poet&mdash;a Great Poet. Tell her
that from me, will you, please, Mary Adeline?"</p>

<p>"Oh, brother, I couldn't...we never speak of him," the startled
girl faltered, hurrying away.</p>

<p>In the cove where the Commodore's sloop had ridden a few hours
earlier a biggish rowing-boat took the waking ripples. Young Raycie
paddled out to her, fastened his skiff to the moorings, and hastily
clambered into the boat.</p>

<p>From various recesses in his pockets he produced rope, string, a
carpet-layer's needle, and other unexpected and incongruous tackle;
then lashing one of the oars across the top of the other, and
jamming the latter upright between the forward thwart and the bow,
he rigged the flowered bed-quilt on this mast, knotted a rope to
the free end of the quilt, and sat down in the stern, one hand on
the rudder, the other on his improvised sheet.</p>

<p>Venus, brooding silverly above a line of pale green sky, made a
pool of glory in the sea as the dawn-breeze plumped the lover's
sail...</p>

<p>On the shelving pebbles of another cove, two or three miles down
the Sound, Lewis Raycie lowered his queer sail and beached his
boat. A clump of willows on the shingle-edge mysteriously stirred
and parted, and Treeshy Kent was in his arms.</p>

<p>The sun was just pushing above a belt of low clouds in the east,
spattering them with liquid gold, and Venus blanched as the light
spread upward. But under the willows it was still dusk, a watery
green dusk in which the secret murmurs of the night were
caught.</p>

<p>"Treeshy&mdash;Treeshy!" the young man cried, kneeling beside
her&mdash;and then, a moment later: "My angel, are you sure that no
one guesses&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The girl gave a faint laugh which screwed up her funny nose. She
leaned her head on his shoulder, her round forehead and rough
braids pressed against his cheek, her hands in his, breathing
quickly and joyfully.</p>

<p>"I thought I should never get here," Lewis grumbled, "with that
ridiculous bed-quilt&mdash;and it'll be broad day soon! To think
that I was of age yesterday, and must come to you in a boat rigged
like a child's toy on a duck-pond! If you knew how it humiliates
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does it matter, dear, since you're of age now, and your
own master?"</p>

<p>"But am I, though? He says so&mdash;but it's only on his own
terms; only while I do what he wants! You'll see...I've a credit of
ten thousand dollars...ten...thou...sand...d'you hear?...placed to
my name in a London bank; and not a penny here to bless myself with
meanwhile...Why, Treeshy darling, why, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>She flung her arms about his neck, and through their innocent
kisses he could taste her tears. "What IS it, Treeshy?" he implored
her.</p>

<p>"I...oh, I'd forgotten it was to be our last day together till
you spoke of London&mdash;cruel, cruel!" she reproached him; and
through the green twilight of the willows her eyes blazed on him
like two stormy stars. No other eyes he knew could express such
elemental rage as Treeshy's.</p>

<p>"You little spitfire, you!" he laughed back somewhat chokingly.
"Yes, it's our last day&mdash;but not for long; at our age two
years are not so very long, after all, are they? And when I come
back to you I'll come as my own master, independent,
free&mdash;come to claim you in face of everything and everybody!
Think of that, darling, and be brave for my sake...brave and
patient...as I mean to be!" he declared heroically.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you&mdash;you'll see other girls; heaps and heaps of
them; in those wicked old countries where they're so lovely. My
uncle Kent says the European countries are all wicked, even my own
poor Italy..."</p>

<p>"But YOU, Treeshy; you'll be seeing cousins Bill and Donald
meanwhile&mdash;seeing them all day long and every day. And you
know you've a weakness for that great hulk of a Bill. Ah, if only I
stood six-foot-one in my stockings I'd go with an easier heart, you
fickle child!" he tried to banter her.</p>

<p>"Fickle? Fickle? ME&mdash;oh, Lewis!"</p>

<p>He felt the premonitory sweep of sobs, and his untried courage
failed him. It was delicious, in theory, to hold weeping beauty to
one's breast, but terribly alarming, he found, in practice. There
came a responsive twitching in his throat.</p>

<p>"No, no; firm as adamant, true as steel; that's what we both
mean to be, isn't it, cara?"</p>

<p>"Caro, yes," she sighed, appeased.</p>

<p>"And you'll write to me regularly, Treeshy&mdash;long long
letters? I may count on that, mayn't I, wherever I am? And they
must all be numbered, every one of them, so that I shall know at
once if I've missed one; remember!"</p>

<p>"And, Lewis, you'll wear them here?" (She touched his breast.)
"Oh, not ALL," she added, laughing, "for they'd make such a big
bundle that you'd soon have a hump in front like
Pulcinella&mdash;but always at least the last one, just the last
one. Promise!"</p>

<p>"Always, I promise&mdash;as long as they're kind," he said,
still struggling to take a spirited line.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lewis, they will be, as long as yours are&mdash;and long
long afterward..."</p>

<p>Venus failed and vanished in the sun's uprising.</p>

<h3>3.</h3>

<p>THE crucial moment, Lewis had always known, would not be that of
his farewell to Treeshy, but of his final interview with his
father.</p>

<p>On that everything hung: his immediate future as well as his
more distant prospects. As he stole home in the early sunlight,
over the dew-drenched grass, he glanced up apprehensively at Mr.
Raycie's windows, and thanked his stars that they were still
tightly shuttered.</p>

<p>There was no doubt, as Mrs. Raycie said, that her husband's
"using language" before ladies showed him to be in high good
humour, relaxed and slippered, as it were&mdash;a state his family
so seldom saw him in that Lewis had sometimes impertinently
wondered to what awful descent from the clouds he and his two
sisters owed their timorous being.</p>

<p>It was all very well to tell himself, as he often did, that the
bulk of the money was his mother's, and that he could turn her
round his little finger. What difference did that make? Mr. Raycie,
the day after his marriage, had quietly taken over the management
of his wife's property, and deducted, from the very moderate
allowance he accorded her, all her little personal expenses, even
to the postage-stamps she used, and the dollar she put in the plate
every Sunday. He called the allowance her "pin-money," since, as he
often reminded her, he paid all the household bills himself, so
that Mrs. Raycie's quarterly pittance could be entirely devoted, if
she chose, to frills and feathers.</p>

<p>"And will be, if you respect my wishes, my dear," he always
added. "I like to see a handsome figure well set-off, and not to
have our friends imagine, when they come to dine, that Mrs. Raycie
is sick above-stairs, and I've replaced her by a poor relation in
allapacca." In compliance with which Mrs. Raycie, at once flattered
and terrified, spent her last penny in adorning herself and her
daughters, and had to stint their bedroom fires, and the servants'
meals, in order to find a penny for any private necessity.</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie had long since convinced his wife that this method of
dealing with her, if not lavish, was suitable, and in fact
"handsome"; when she spoke of the subject to her relations it was
with tears of gratitude for her husband's kindness in assuming the
management of her property. As he managed it exceedingly well, her
hard-headed brothers (glad to have the responsibility off their
hands, and convinced that, if left to herself, she would have
muddled her money away in ill-advised charities) were disposed to
share her approval of Mr. Raycie; though her old mother sometimes
said helplessly: "When I think that Lucy Ann can't as much as have
a drop of gruel brought up to her without his weighing the
oatmeal..." But even that was only whispered, lest Mr. Raycie's
mysterious faculty of hearing what was said behind his back should
bring sudden reprisals on the venerable lady to whom he always
alluded, with a tremor in his genial voice, as "my dear
mother-in-law&mdash;unless indeed she will allow me to call her,
more briefly but more truly, my dear mother."</p>

<p>To Lewis, hitherto, Mr. Raycie had meted the same measure as to
the females of the household. He had dressed him well, educated him
expensively, lauded him to the skies&mdash;and counted every penny
of his allowance. Yet there was a difference; and Lewis was as well
aware of it as any one.</p>

<p>The dream, the ambition, the passion of Mr. Raycie's life, was
(as his son knew) to found a Family; and he had only Lewis to found
it with. He believed in primogeniture, in heirlooms, in entailed
estates, in all the ritual of the English "landed" tradition. No
one was louder than he in praise of the democratic institutions
under which he lived; but he never thought of them as affecting
that more private but more important institution, the Family; and
to the Family all his care and all his thoughts were given. The
result, as Lewis dimly guessed, was, that upon his own shrinking
and inadequate head was centred all the passion contained in the
vast expanse of Mr. Raycie's breast. Lewis was his very own, and
Lewis represented what was most dear to him; and for both these
reasons Mr. Raycie set an inordinate value on the boy (a quite
different thing, Lewis thought from loving him).</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie was particularly proud of his son's taste for
letters. Himself not a wholly unread man, he admired intensely what
he called the "cultivated gentleman"&mdash;and that was what Lewis
was evidently going to be. Could he have combined with this
tendency a manlier frame, and an interest in the few forms of sport
then popular among gentlemen, Mr. Raycie's satisfaction would have
been complete; but whose is, in this disappointing world? Meanwhile
he flattered himself that, Lewis being still young and malleable,
and his health certainly mending, two years of travel and adventure
might send him back a very different figure, physically as well as
mentally. Mr. Raycie had himself travelled in his youth, and was
persuaded that the experience was formative; he secretly hoped for
the return of a bronzed and broadened Lewis, seasoned by
independence and adventure, and having discreetly sown his wild
oats in foreign pastures, where they would not contaminate the home
crop.</p>

<p>All this Lewis guessed; and he guessed as well that these two
wander-years were intended by Mr. Raycie to lead up to a marriage
and an establishment after Mr. Raycie's own heart, but in which
Lewis was not to have even a consulting voice.</p>

<p>"He's going to give me all the advantages&mdash;for his own
purpose," the young man summed it up as he went down to join the
family at the breakfast table.</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie was never more resplendent than at that moment of the
day and season. His spotless white duck trousers, strapped under
kid boots, his thin kerseymere coat, and drab piqué waistcoat
crossed below a snowy stock, made him look as fresh as the morning
and as appetizing as the peaches and cream banked before him.</p>

<p>Opposite sat Mrs. Raycie, immaculate also, but paler than usual,
as became a mother about to part from her only son; and between the
two was Sarah Anne, unusually pink, and apparently occupied in
trying to screen her sister's empty seat. Lewis greeted them, and
seated himself at his mother's right.</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie drew out his guillochee repeating watch, and
detaching it from its heavy gold chain laid it on the table beside
him.</p>

<p>"Mary Adeline is late again. It is a somewhat unusual thing for
a sister to be late at the last meal she is to take&mdash;for two
years&mdash;with her only brother."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Raycie!" Mrs. Raycie faltered.</p>

<p>"I say, the idea is peculiar. Perhaps," said Mr. Raycie
sarcastically, "I am going to be blessed with a PECULIAR
daughter."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Mary Adeline is beginning a sick headache, sir. She
tried to get up, but really could not," said Sarah Anne in a
rush.</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie's only reply was to arch ironic eyebrows, and Lewis
hastily intervened: "I'm sorry, sir; but it may be my
fault&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Raycie paled, Sarah Anne, purpled, and Mr. Raycie echoed
with punctilious incredulity: "Your&mdash;fault?"</p>

<p>"In being the occasion, sir, of last night's too-sumptuous
festivity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!" Mr. Raycie laughed, his thunders
instantly dispelled.</p>

<p>He pushed back his chair and nodded to his son with a smile; and
the two, leaving the ladies to wash up the teacups (as was still
the habit in genteel families) betook themselves to Mr. Raycie's
study.</p>

<p>What Mr. Raycie studied in this apartment&mdash;except the
accounts, and ways of making himself unpleasant to his
family&mdash;Lewis had never been able to discover. It was a small
bare formidable room; and the young man, who never crossed the
threshold but with a sinking of his heart, felt it sink lower than
ever. "NOW!" he thought.</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie took the only easy-chair, and began.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, our time is short, but long enough for what I
have to say. In a few hours you will be setting out on your great
journey: an important event in the life of any young man. Your
talents and character&mdash;combined with your means of improving
the opportunity&mdash;make me hope that in your case it will be
decisive. I expect you to come home from this trip a
man&mdash;"</p>

<p>So far, it was all to order, so to speak; Lewis could have
recited it beforehand. He bent his head in acquiescence.</p>

<p>"A man," Mr. Raycie repeated, "prepared to play a part, a
considerable part, in the social life of the community. I expect
you to be a figure in New York; and I shall give you the means to
be so." He cleared his throat. "But means are not
enough&mdash;though you must never forget that they are essential.
Education, polish, experience of the world; these are what so many
of our men of standing lack. What do they know of Art or Letters?
We have had little time here to produce either as yet&mdash;you
spoke?" Mr. Raycie broke off with a crushing courtesy.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;oh, no," his son stammered.</p>

<p>"Ah; I thought you might be about to allude to certain
blasphemous penny-a-liners whose poetic ravings are said to have
given them a kind of pothouse notoriety."</p>

<p>Lewis reddened at the allusion but was silent, and his father
went on:</p>

<p>"Where is our Byron&mdash;our Scott&mdash;our Shakespeare? And
in painting it is the same. Where are our Old Masters? We are not
without contemporary talent; but for works of genius we must still
look to the past; we must, in most cases, content ourselves with
copies...Ah, here I know, my dear boy, I touch a responsive chord!
Your love of the arts has not passed unperceived; and I mean, I
desire, to do all I can to encourage it. Your future position in
the world&mdash;your duties and obligations as a gentleman and a
man of fortune&mdash;will not permit you to become, yourself, an
eminent painter or a famous sculptor; but I shall raise no
objection to your dabbling in these arts as an amateur&mdash;at
least while you are travelling abroad. It will form your taste,
strengthen your judgment, and give you, I hope, the discernment
necessary to select for me a few masterpieces which shall NOT be
copies. Copies," Mr. Raycie pursued with a deepening emphasis, "are
for the less discriminating, or for those less blessed with this
world's goods. Yes, my dear Lewis, I wish to create a gallery: a
gallery of Heirlooms. Your mother participates in this
ambition&mdash;she desires to see on our walls a few original
specimens of the Italian genius. Raphael, I fear, we can hardly
aspire to; but a Domenichino, an Albano, a Carlo Dolci, a Guercino,
a Carlo Maratta&mdash;one or two of Salvator Rosa's noble
landscapes...you see my idea? There shall be a Raycie Gallery; and
it shall be your mission to get together its nucleus." Mr. Raycie
paused, and mopped his flowing forehead. "I believe I could have
given my son no task more to his liking."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir, none indeed!" Lewis cried, flushing and paling. He
had in fact never suspected this part of his father's plan, and his
heart swelled with the honour of so unforeseen a mission. Nothing,
in truth, could have made him prouder or happier. For a moment he
forgot love, forgot Treeshy, forgot everything but the rapture of
moving among the masterpieces of which he had so long dreamed,
moving not as a mere hungry spectator but as one whose privilege it
should at least be to single out and carry away some of the lesser
treasures. He could hardly take in what had happened, and the shock
of the announcement left him, as usual, inarticulate.</p>

<p>He heard his father booming on, developing the plan, explaining
with his usual pompous precision that one of the partners of the
London bank in which Lewis's funds were deposited was himself a
noted collector, and had agreed to provide the young traveller with
letters of introduction to other connoisseurs, both in France and
Italy, so that Lewis's acquisitions might be made under the most
enlightened guidance.</p>

<p>"It is," Mr. Raycie concluded, "in order to put you on a footing
of equality with the best collectors that I have placed such a
large sum at your disposal. I reckon that for ten thousand dollars
you can travel for two years in the very best style; and I mean to
place another five thousand to your credit"&mdash;he paused, and
let the syllables drop slowly into his son's brain: "five thousand
dollars for the purchase of works of art, which
eventually&mdash;remember&mdash;will be yours; and will be handed
on, I trust, to your sons' sons as long as the name of Raycie
survives"&mdash;a length of time, Mr. Raycie's tone seemed to
imply, hardly to be measured in periods less extensive than those
of the Egyptian dynasties.</p>

<p>Lewis heard him with a whirling brain. FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS!
The sum seemed so enormous, even in dollars, and so incalculably
larger when translated into any continental currency, that he
wondered why his father, in advance, had given up all hope of a
Raphael..."If I travel economically," he said to himself, "and deny
myself unnecessary luxuries, I may yet be able to surprise him by
bringing one back. And my mother&mdash;how magnanimous, how
splendid! Now I see why she has consented to all the little
economies that sometimes seemed so paltry and so
humiliating..."</p>

<p>The young man's eyes filled with tears, but he was still silent,
though he longed as never before to express his gratitude and
admiration to his father. He had entered the study expecting a
parting sermon on the subject of thrift, coupled with the
prospective announcement of a "suitable establishment" (he could
even guess the particular Huzzard girl his father had in view); and
instead he had been told to spend his princely allowance in a
princely manner, and to return home with a gallery of masterpieces.
"At least," he murmured to himself, "it shall contain a
Correggio."</p>

<p>"Well, sir?" Mr. Raycie boomed.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir&mdash;" his son cried, and flung himself on the vast
slope of the parental waistcoat.</p>

<p>Amid all these accumulated joys there murmured deep down in him
the thought that nothing had been said or done to interfere with
his secret plans about Treeshy. It seemed almost as if his father
had tacitly accepted the idea of their unmentioned engagement; and
Lewis felt half guilty at not confessing to it then and there. But
the gods are formidable even when they unbend; never more so,
perhaps, than at such moments...</p>

<h2>PART 2.</h2>

<h3>4.</h3>

<p>LEWIS RAYCIE stood on a projecting rock and surveyed the sublime
spectacle of Mont Blanc.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant August day, and the air, at that height, was
already so sharp that he had had to put on his fur-lined pelisse.
Behind him, at a respectful distance, was the travelling servant
who, at a signal, had brought it up to him; below, in the bend of
the mountain road, stood the light and elegant carriage which had
carried him thus far on his travels.</p>

<p>Scarcely more than a year had passed since he had waved a
farewell to New York from the deck of the packet-ship headed down
the bay; yet, to the young man confidently facing Mont Blanc,
nothing seemed left in him of that fluid and insubstantial being,
the former Lewis Raycie, save a lurking and abeyant fear of Mr.
Raycie senior. Even that, however, was so attenuated by distance
and time, so far sunk below the horizon, and anchored on the far
side of the globe, that it stirred in its sleep only when a
handsomely folded and wafered letter in his parent's writing was
handed out across the desk of some continental counting-house. Mr.
Raycie senior did not write often, and when he did it was in a
bland and stilted strain. He felt at a disadvantage on paper, and
his natural sarcasm was swamped in the rolling periods which it
cost him hours of labour to bring forth; so that the dreaded
quality lurked for his son only in the curve of certain letters,
and in a positively awful way of writing out, at full length, the
word "Esquire".</p>

<p>It was not that Lewis had broken with all the memories of his
past of a year ago. Many still lingered in him, or rather had been
transferred to the new man he had become&mdash;as for instance his
tenderness for Treeshy Kent, which, somewhat to his surprise, had
obstinately resisted all the assaults of English keepsake beauties
and almond-eyed houris of the East. It startled him at times, to
find Treeshy's short dusky face, with its round forehead, the
widely spaced eyes and the high cheek-bones, starting out at him
suddenly in the street of some legendary town, or in a landscape of
languid beauty, just as he had now and again been arrested in an
exotic garden by the very scent of the verbena under the verandah
at home. His travels had confirmed rather than weakened the family
view of Treeshy's plainness; she could not be made to fit into any
of the patterns of female beauty so far submitted to him; yet there
she was, ensconced in his new heart and mind as deeply as in the
old, though her kisses seemed less vivid, and the peculiar rough
notes of her voice hardly reached him. Sometimes, half irritably,
he said to himself that with an effort he could disperse her once
for all; yet she lived on in him, unseen yet ineffaceable, like the
image on a daguerreotype plate, no less there because so often
invisible.</p>

<p>To the new Lewis, however, the whole business was less important
than he had once thought it. His suddenly acquired maturity made
Treeshy seem a petted child rather than the guide, the Beatrice, he
had once considered her; and he promised himself, with an elderly
smile, that as soon as he got to Italy he would write her the long
letter for which he was now considerably in her debt.</p>

<p>His travels had first carried him to England. There he spent
some weeks in collecting letters and recommendations for his tour,
in purchasing his travelling-carriage and its numerous
appurtenances, and in driving in it from cathedral town to storied
castle, omitting nothing, from Abbotsford to Kenilworth, which
deserved the attention of a cultivated mind. From England he
crossed to Calais, moving slowly southward to the Mediterranean;
and there, taking ship for the Piraeus, he plunged into pure
romance, and the tourist became a Giaour.</p>

<p>It was the East which had made him into a new Lewis Raycie; the
East, so squalid and splendid, so pestilent and so poetic, so full
of knavery and romance and fleas and nightingales, and so
different, alike in its glories and its dirt, from what his
studious youth had dreamed. After Smyrna and the bazaars, after
Damascus and Palmyra, the Acropolis, Mytilene and Sunium, what
could be left in his mind of Canal Street and the lawn above the
Sound? Even the mosquitoes, which seemed at first the only
connecting link, were different, because he fought with them in
scenes so different; and a young gentleman who had journeyed across
the desert in Arabian dress, slept under goats'-hair tents, been
attacked by robbers in the Peloponnesus and despoiled by his own
escort at Baalbek, and by customs' officials everywhere, could not
but look with a smile on the terrors that walk New York and the
Hudson River. Encased in security and monotony, that other Lewis
Raycie, when his little figure bobbed up to the surface, seemed
like a new-born babe preserved in alcohol. Even Mr. Raycie senior's
thunders were now no more than the far-off murmur of summer
lightning on a perfect evening. Had Mr. Raycie ever really
frightened Lewis? Why, now he was not even frightened by Mont
Blanc!</p>

<p>He was still gazing with a sense of easy equality at its awful
pinnacles when another travelling-carriage paused near his own, and
a young man, eagerly jumping from it, and also followed by a
servant with a cloak, began to mount the slope. Lewis at once
recognized the carriage, and the light springing figure of the
young man, his blue coat and swelling stock, and the scar slightly
distorting his handsome and eloquent mouth. It was the Englishman
who had arrived at the Montanvert inn the night before with a
valet, a guide, and such a cargo of books, maps and sketching
materials as threatened to overshadow even Lewis's outfit.</p>

<p>Lewis, at first, had not been greatly drawn to the newcomer,
who, seated aloof in the dining-room, seemed not to see his
fellow-traveller. The truth was that Lewis was dying for a little
conversation. His astonishing experiences were so tightly packed in
him (with no outlet save the meagre trickle of his nightly diary)
that he felt they would soon melt into the vague blur of other
people's travels unless he could give them fresh reality by talking
them over. And the stranger with the deep-blue eyes that matched
his coat, the scarred cheek and eloquent lip, seemed to Lewis a
worthy listener. The Englishman appeared to think otherwise. He
preserved an air of moody abstraction, which Lewis's vanity
imagined him to have put on as the gods becloud themselves for
their secret errands; and the curtness of his goodnight was (Lewis
flattered himself) surpassed only by the young New Yorker's.</p>

<p>But today all was different. The stranger advanced affably,
raised his hat from his tossed statue-like hair, and enquired with
a smile: "Are you by any chance interested in the forms of cirrous
clouds?"</p>

<p>His voice was as sweet as his smile, and the two were reinforced
by a glance so winning that it made the odd question seem not only
pertinent but natural. Lewis, though surprised, was not
disconcerted. He merely coloured with the unwonted sense of his
ignorance, and replied ingenuously: "I believe, sir, I am
interested in everything."</p>

<p>"A noble answer!" cried the other, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"But I must add," Lewis continued with courageous honesty, "that
I have never as yet had occasion to occupy myself particularly with
the form of cirrous clouds."</p>

<p>His companion looked at him merrily. "That," he said, "is no
reason why you shouldn't begin to do so now!" To which Lewis as
merrily agreed. "For in order to be interested in things," the
other continued more gravely, "it is only necessary to see them;
and I believe I am not wrong in saying that you are one of the
privileged beings to whom the seeing eye has been given."</p>

<p>Lewis blushed his agreement, and his interlocutor continued:
"You are one of those who have been on the road to Damascus."</p>

<p>"On the road? I've been to the place itself!" the wanderer
exclaimed, bursting with the particulars of his travels; and then
blushed more deeply at the perception that the other's use of the
name had of course been figurative.</p>

<p>The young Englishman's face lit up. "You've been to
Damascus&mdash;literally been there yourself? But that may be
almost as interesting, in its quite different way, as the formation
of clouds or lichens. For the present," he continued with a gesture
toward the mountain, "I must devote myself to the extremely
inadequate rendering of some of those delicate aiguilles; a bit of
drudgery not likely to interest you in the face of so sublime a
scene. But perhaps this evening&mdash;if, as I think, we are
staying in the same inn&mdash;you will give me a few minutes of
your society, and tell me something of your travels. My father," he
added with his engaging smile, "has had packed with my
paint-brushes a few bottles of a wholly trustworthy Madeira; and if
you will favour me with your company at dinner..."</p>

<p>He signed to his servant to undo the sketching materials, spread
his cloak on the rock, and was already lost in his task as Lewis
descended to the carriage.</p>

<p>The Madeira proved as trustworthy as his host had promised.
Perhaps it was its exceptional quality which threw such a golden
lustre over the dinner; unless it were rather the conversation of
the blue-eyed Englishman which made Lewis Raycie, always a small
drinker, feel that in his company every drop was nectar.</p>

<p>When Lewis joined his host it had been with the secret hope of
at last being able to talk; but when the evening was over (and they
kept it up to the small hours) he perceived that he had chiefly
listened. Yet there had been no sense of suppression, of thwarted
volubility; he had been given all the openings he wanted. Only,
whenever he produced a little fact it was instantly overflowed by
the other's imagination till it burned like a dull pebble tossed
into a rushing stream. For whatever Lewis said was seen by his
companion from a new angle, and suggested a new train of thought;
each commonplace item of experience became a many-faceted crystal
flashing with unexpected fires. The young Englishman's mind moved
in a world of associations and references far more richly peopled
than Lewis's; but his eager communicativeness, his directness of
speech and manner, instantly opened its gates to the simpler youth.
It was certainly not the Madeira which sped the hours and flooded
them with magic; but the magic gave the Madeira&mdash;excellent,
and reputed of its kind, as Lewis afterward learned&mdash;a taste
no other vintage was to have for him.</p>

<p>"Oh, but we must meet again in Italy&mdash;there are many things
there that I could perhaps help you to see," the young Englishman
declared as they swore eternal friendship on the stairs of the
sleeping inn.</p>

<h3>5.</h3>

<p>IT was in a tiny Venetian church, no more than a chapel, that
Lewis Raycie's eyes had been unsealed&mdash;in a dull-looking
little church not even mentioned in the guide-books. But for his
chance encounter with the young Englishman in the shadow of Mont
Blanc, Lewis would never have heard of the place; but then what
else that was worth knowing would he ever have heard of, he
wondered?</p>

<p>He had stood a long time looking at the frescoes, put off at
first&mdash;he could admit it now&mdash;by a certain stiffness in
the attitudes of the people, by the childish elaboration of their
dress (so different from the noble draperies which Sir Joshua's
Discourses on Art had taught him to admire in the great painters),
and by the innocent inexpressive look in their young
faces&mdash;for even the gray-beards seemed young. And then
suddenly his gaze had lit on one of these faces in particular: that
of a girl with round cheeks, high cheek-bones and widely set eyes
under an intricate head-dress of pearl-woven braids. Why, it was
Treeshy&mdash;Treeshy Kent to the life! And so far from being
thought "plain," the young lady was no other than the peerless
princess about whom the tale revolved. And what a fairy-land she
lived in&mdash;full of lithe youths and round-faced pouting
maidens, rosy old men and burnished blackamoors, pretty birds and
cats and nibbling rabbits&mdash;and all involved and enclosed in
golden balustrades, in colonnades of pink and blue, laurel-garlands
festooned from ivory balconies, and domes and minarets against
summer seas! Lewis's imagination lost itself in the scene; he
forgot to regret the noble draperies, the exalted sentiments, the
fuliginous backgrounds, of the artists he had come to Italy to
admire&mdash;forgot Sassoferrato, Guido Reni, Carlo Dolce, Lo
Spagnoletto, the Carracci, and even the Transfiguration of Raphael,
though he knew it to be the greatest picture in the world.</p>

<p>After that he had seen almost everything else that Italian art
had to offer; had been to Florence, Naples, Rome; to Bologna to
study the Eclectic School, to Parma to examine the Correggios and
the Giulio Romanos. But that first vision had laid a magic seed
between his lips; the seed that makes you hear what the birds say
and the grasses whisper. Even if his English friend had not
continued at his side, pointing out, explaining, inspiring. Lewis
Raycie flattered himself that the round face of the little Saint
Ursula would have led him safely and confidently past all her
rivals. She had become his touchstone, his star: how insipid seemed
to him all the sheep-faced Virgins draped in red and blue paint
after he had looked into her wondering girlish eyes and traced the
elaborate pattern of her brocades! He could remember now, quite
distinctly, the day when he had given up even Beatrice Cenci...and
as for that fat naked Magdalen of Carlo Dolce's, lolling over the
book she was not reading, and ogling the spectator in the good old
way...faugh! Saint Ursula did not need to rescue him from
HER...</p>

<p>His eyes had been opened to a new world of art. And this world
it was his mission to reveal to others&mdash;he, the insignificant
and ignorant Lewis Raycie, as "but for the grace of God," and that
chance encounter on Mont Blanc, he might have gone on being to the
end! He shuddered to think of the army of Neapolitan beggar-boys,
bituminous monks, whirling prophets, languishing Madonnas and
pink-rumped amorini who might have been travelling home with him in
the hold of the fast new steam-packet.</p>

<p>His excitement had something of the apostle's ecstasy. He was
not only, in a few hours, to embrace Treeshy, and be reunited to
his honoured parents; he was also to go forth and preach the new
gospel to them that sat in the darkness of Salvator Rosa and Lo
Spagnoletto...</p>

<p>The first thing that struck Lewis was the smallness of the house
on the Sound, and the largeness of Mr. Raycie.</p>

<p>He had expected to receive the opposite impression. In his
recollection the varnished Tuscan villa had retained something of
its impressiveness, even when compared to its supposed originals.
Perhaps the very contrast between their draughty distances and
naked floors, and the expensive carpets and bright fires of High
Point, magnified his memory of the latter&mdash;there were moments
when the thought of its groaning board certainly added to the
effect. But the image of Mr. Raycie had meanwhile dwindled.
Everything about him, as his son looked back, seemed narrow,
juvenile, almost childish. His bluster about Edgar Poe, for
instance&mdash;true poet still to Lewis, though he had since heard
richer notes; his fussy tyranny of his womenkind; his unconscious
but total ignorance of most of the things, books, people, ideas,
that now filled his son's mind; above all, the arrogance and
incompetence of his artistic judgments. Beyond a narrow range of
reading&mdash;mostly, Lewis suspected, culled in drowsy
after-dinner snatches from Knight's "Half-hours with the Best
Authors"&mdash;Mr. Raycie made no pretence to book-learning; left
THAT, as he handsomely said, "to the professors." But on matters of
art he was dogmatic and explicit, prepared to justify his opinions
by the citing of eminent authorities and of market-prices, and
quite clear, as his farewell talk with his son had shown, as to
which Old Masters should be privileged to figure in the Raycie
collection.</p>

<p>The young man felt no impatience of these judgements. America
was a long way from Europe, and it was many years since Mr. Raycie
had travelled. He could hardly be blamed for not knowing that the
things he admired were no longer admirable, still less for not
knowing why. The pictures before which Lewis had knelt in spirit
had been virtually undiscovered, even by art-students and critics,
in his father's youth. How was an American gentleman, filled with
his own self-importance, and paying his courier the highest salary
to show him the accredited "Masterpieces"&mdash;how was he to guess
that whenever he stood rapt before a Sassoferrato or a Carlo Dolce
one of those unknown treasures lurked near by under dust and
cobwebs?</p>

<p>No; Lewis felt only tolerance and understanding. Such a view was
not one to magnify the paternal image; but when the young man
entered the study where Mr. Raycie sat immobilized by gout, the
swathed leg stretched along his sofa seemed only another reason for
indulgence...</p>

<p>Perhaps, Lewis thought afterward, it was his father's prone
position, the way his great bulk billowed over the sofa, and the
lame leg reached out like a mountain-ridge, that made him suddenly
seem to fill the room; or else the sound of his voice booming
irritably across the threshold, and scattering Mrs. Raycie and the
girls with a fierce: "And now, ladies, if the hugging and kissing
are over, I should be glad of a moment with my son." But it was odd
that, after mother and daughters had withdrawn with all their hoops
and flounces, the study seemed to grow even smaller, and Lewis
himself to feel more like a David without the pebble.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy," his father cried, crimson and puffing, "here you
are at home again, with many adventures to relate, no doubt; and a
few masterpieces to show me, as I gather from the drafts on my
exchequer."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to the masterpieces, sir, certainly," Lewis simpered,
wondering why his voice sounded so fluty, and his smile was
produced with such a conscious muscular effort.</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;good," Mr. Raycie approved, waving a violet hand
which seemed to be ripening for a bandage. "Reedy carried out my
orders, I presume? Saw to it that the paintings were deposited with
the bulk of your luggage in Canal Street?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir; Mr. Reedy was on the dock with precise
instructions. You now he always carries out your orders," Lewis
ventured with a faint irony.</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie stared. "Mr. Reedy," he said, "does what I tell him,
if that's what you mean; otherwise he would hardly have been in my
employ for over thirty years."</p>

<p>Lewis was silent, and his father examined him critically. "You
appear to have filled out; your health is satisfactory?
Well...well...Mr. Robert Huzzard and his daughters are dining here
this evening, by the way, and will no doubt be expecting to see the
latest French novelties in stocks and waistcoats. Malvina has
become a very elegant figure, your sisters tell me." Mr. Raycie
chuckled, and Lewis thought: "I KNEW it was the oldest Huzzard
girl!" while a slight chill ran down his spine.</p>

<p>"As to the pictures," Mr. Raycie pursued with growing animation,
"I am laid low, as you see, by this cursed affliction, and till the
doctors get me up again, here must I lie and try to imagine how
your treasures will look in the new gallery. And meanwhile, my dear
boy, I need hardly say that no one is to be admitted to see them
till they have been inspected by me and suitably hung. Reedy shall
begin unpacking at once; and when we move to town next month Mrs.
Raycie, God willing, shall give the handsomest evening party New
York has yet seen, to show my son's collection, and perhaps...eh,
well?...to celebrate another interesting event in his history."</p>

<p>Lewis met this with a faint but respectful gurgle, and before
his blurred eyes rose the wistful face of Treeshy Kent.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, I shall see her tomorrow," he thought, taking heart
again as soon as he was out of his father's presence.</p>

<h3>6.</h3>

<p>MR. RAYCIE stood silent for a long time after making the round
of the room in the Canal Street house where the unpacked pictures
had been set out.</p>

<p>He had driven to town alone with Lewis, sternly rebuffing his
daughters' timid hints, and Mrs. Raycie's mute but visible yearning
to accompany him. Though the gout was over he was till weak and
irritable, and Mrs. Raycie, fluttered at the thought of "crossing
him," had swept the girls away at his first frown.</p>

<p>Lewis's hopes rose as he followed his parent's limping progress.
The pictures, though standing on chairs and tables, and set
clumsily askew to catch the light, bloomed out of the half-dusk of
the empty house with a new and persuasive beauty. Ah, how right he
had been&mdash;how inevitable that his father should own it!</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie halted in the middle of the room. He was still
silent, and his face, so quick to frown and glare, wore the calm,
almost expressionless look known to Lewis as the mask of inward
perplexity. "Oh, of course it will take a little time," the son
thought, tingling with the eagerness of youth.</p>

<p>At last, Mr. Raycie woke the echoes by clearing his throat; but
the voice which issued from it was as inexpressive as his face. "It
is singular," he said, "how little the best copies of the Old
Masters resemble the originals. For these ARE Originals?" he
questioned, suddenly swinging about on Lewis.</p>

<p>"Oh, absolutely, sir! Besides&mdash;" The young man was about to
add: "No one would ever have taken the trouble to copy
them"&mdash;but hastily checked himself.</p>

<p>"Besides&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I meant, I had the most competent advice obtainable."</p>

<p>"So I assume; since it was the express condition on which I
authorised your purchases."</p>

<p>Lewis felt himself shrinking and his father expanding; but he
sent a glance along the wall, and beauty shed her reviving beam on
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie's brows projected ominously; but his face remained
smooth and dubious. Once more he cast a slow glance about him.</p>

<p>"Let us," he said pleasantly, "begin with the Raphael." And it
was evident that he did not know which way to turn.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, a Raphael nowadays&mdash;I warned you it would be far
beyond my budget."</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie's face fell slightly. "I had hoped nevertheless...for
an inferior specimen..." Then with an effort: "The Sassoferrato,
then."</p>

<p>Lewis felt more at his ease; he even ventured a respectful
smile. "Sassoferrato is ALL inferior, isn't he? The fact is, he no
longer stands...quite as he used to..."</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie stood motionless: his eyes were vacuously fixed on
the nearest picture.</p>

<p>"Sassoferrato...no longer...?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, NO; not for a collection of this quality."</p>

<p>Lewis saw that he had at last struck the right note. Something
large and uncomfortable appeared to struggle in Mr. Raycie's
throat; then he gave a cough which might almost have been said to
cast out Sassoferrato.</p>

<p>There was another pause before he pointed with his stick to a
small picture representing a snub-nosed young woman with a high
forehead and jewelled coif, against a background of delicately
interwoven columbines. "Is THAT," he questioned, "your Carlo Dolce?
The style is much the same, I see; but it seems to me lacking in
his peculiar sentiment."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it's not a Carlo Dolce: it's a Piero della Francesca,
sir!" burst in triumph from the trembling Lewis.</p>

<p>His father sternly faced him. "It's a COPY, you mean? I thought
so!"</p>

<p>"No, no; not a copy, it's by a great painter...a much
greater..."</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie had reddened sharply at his mistake. To conceal his
natural annoyance he assumed a still more silken manner. "In that
case," he said, "I think I should like to see the inferior painters
first. Where IS the Carlo Dolce?"</p>

<p>"There IS no Carlo Dolce," said Lewis, white to the lips.</p>

<p>The young man's next distinct recollection was of standing, he
knew not how long afterward, before the armchair in which his
father had sunk down, almost as white and shaken as himself.</p>

<p>"This," stammered Mr. Raycie, "this is going to bring back my
gout..." But when Lewis entreated: "Oh, sir, do let us drive back
quietly to the country, and give me a chance later to explain...to
put my case"...the old gentleman had struck through the pleading
with a furious wave of his stick.</p>

<p>"Explain later? Put your case later? It's just what I insist
upon your doing here and now!" And Mr. Raycie added hoarsely, and
as if in actual physical anguish: "I understand that young John
Huzzard returned from Rome last week with a Raphael."</p>

<p>After that, Lewis heard himself&mdash;as if with the icy
detachment of a spectator&mdash;marshalling his arguments, pleading
the cause he hoped his pictures would have pleaded for him,
dethroning the old Powers and Principalities, and setting up these
new names in their place. It was first of all the names that stuck
in Mr. Raycie's throat: after spending a life-time committing to
memory the correct pronunciation of words like Lo Spagnoletto and
Giulio Romano, it was bad enough, his wrathful eyes seemed to say,
to have to begin a new set of verbal gymnastics before you could be
sure of saying to a friend with careless accuracy: "And THIS is my
Giotto da Bondone."</p>

<p>But that was only the first shock, soon forgotten in the rush of
greater tribulation. For one might conceivably learn how to
pronounced Giotto da Bondone, and even enjoy doing so, provided the
friend in question recognized the name and bowed to its authority.
But to have your effort received by a blank stare, and the playful
request: "You'll have to say that over again, please"&mdash;to know
that, in going the round of the gallery (the Raycie Gallery!) the
same stare and the same request were likely to be repeated before
each picture; the bitterness of this was so great that Mr. Raycie,
without exaggeration, might have likened his case to that of
Agag.</p>

<p>"God! God! God! Carpatcher, you say this other fellow's called?
Kept him back till the last because it's the gem of the collection,
did you? Carpatcher&mdash;well, he'd have done better to stick to
his trade. Something to do with those new European steam-cars, I
suppose, eh?" Mr. Raycie was so incensed that his irony was less
subtle than usual. "And Angelico you say did that kind of Noah's
Ark soldier in pink armour on gold leaf? Well, THERE I've caught
you tripping, my boy. Not AngelicO, AngelicA; Angelica Kauffman was
a lady. And the damned swindler who foisted that barbarous daub on
you as a picture of hers deserves to be drawn and
quartered&mdash;and shall be, sir, by God, if the law can reach
him! He shall disgorge every penny he's rooked you out of, or my
name's not Halston Raycie! A bargain...you say the thing was a
BARGAIN? Why, the price of a clean postage stamp would be too dear
for it! God&mdash;my son; do you realize you had a TRUST to carry
out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, yes; and it's just because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You might have written; you might at least have placed your
views before me..."</p>

<p>How could Lewis say: "If I had, I knew you'd have refused to let
me buy the pictures?" He could only stammer: "I DID allude to the
revolution in taste...new names coming up...you may
remember..."</p>

<p>"Revolution! New names! Who says so? I had a letter last week
from the London dealers to whom I especially recommended you,
telling me that an undoubted Guido Reni was coming into the market
this summer."</p>

<p>"Oh, the dealers&mdash;THEY don't know!"</p>

<p>"The dealers...don't?...Who does...except yourself?" Mr. Raycie
pronounced in a white sneer.</p>

<p>Lewis, as white, still held his ground. "I wrote you, sir, about
my friends; in Italy, and afterward in England."</p>

<p>"Well, God damn it, I never heard of one of THEIR names before,
either; no more'n of these painters of yours here. I supplied you
with the names of all the advisers you needed, and all the
painters, too; I all but made the collection for you myself, before
you started...I was explicit enough, in all conscience, wasn't
I?"</p>

<p>Lewis smiled faintly. "That's what I hoped the pictures would
be..."</p>

<p>"What? Be what? What'd you mean?"</p>

<p>"Be explicit...Speak for themselves...make you see that their
painters are already superseding some of the better known..."</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie gave an awful laugh. "They are, are they? In whose
estimation? Your friends', I suppose. What's the name, again, of
that fellow you met in Italy, who picked 'em out for you?"</p>

<p>"Ruskin&mdash;John Ruskin," said Lewis.</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie's laugh, prolonged, gathered up into itself a fresh
shower of expletives. "Ruskin&mdash;Ruskin&mdash;just plain John
Ruskin, eh? And who IS this great John Ruskin, who sets God
A'mighty right in his judgments? Who'd you say John Ruskin's father
was, now?"</p>

<p>"A respected wine-merchant in London, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Raycie ceased to laugh: he looked at his son with an
expression of unutterable disgust.</p>

<p>"Retail?"</p>

<p>"I...believe so..."</p>

<p>"Faugh!" said Mr. Raycie.</p>

<p>"It wasn't only Ruskin, father...I told you of those other
friends in London, whom I met on the way home. They inspected the
pictures, and all of them agreed that...that the collection would
some day be very valuable."</p>

<p>"SOME DAY&mdash;did they give you a date...the month and the
year? Ah, those other friends; yes. You said there was a Mr. Brown
and a Mr. Hunt and a Mr. Rossiter, was it? Well, I never heard of
any of those names either&mdash;except perhaps in a trades'
directory."</p>

<p>"It's not Rossiter, father: Dante Rossetti."</p>

<p>"Excuse me: Rossetti. And what does Mr. Dante Rossetti's father
do? Sell macaroni, I presume?"</p>

<p>Lewis was silent, and Mr. Raycie went on, speaking now with a
deadly steadiness: "The friends I sent you to were judges of art,
sir; men who know what a picture's worth; not one of 'em but could
pick out a genuine Raphael. Couldn't you find 'em when you got to
England? Or hadn't they the time to spare for you? You'd better
not," Mr. Raycie added, "tell me THAT, for I know how they'd have
received your father's son."</p>

<p>"Oh, most kindly...they did indeed, sir..."</p>

<p>"Ay; but that didn't suit you. You didn't WANT to be advised.
You wanted to show off before a lot of ignoramuses like yourself.
You wanted&mdash;how'd I know what you wanted? It's as if I'd never
given you an instruction or laid a charge on you! And the
money&mdash;God! Where'd it go to? Buying THIS? Nonsense&mdash;."
Mr. Raycie raised himself heavily on his stick and fixed his angry
eyes on his son. "Own up, Lewis; tell me they got it out of you at
cards. Professional gamblers the lot, I make no doubt; your Ruskin
and your Morris and your Rossiter. Make a business to pick up young
American greenhorns on their travels, I daresay...No? Not that, you
say? Then&mdash;women? God A'mighty, Lewis," gasped Mr. Raycie,
tottering toward his son with outstretched stick, "I'm no
blue-nosed Puritan, sir, and I'd a damn sight rather you told me
you'd spent it on a woman, every penny of it, than let yourself be
fleeced like a simpleton, buying these things that look more like
cuts out o' Foxe's book of Martyrs than Originals of the Old
Masters for a Gentleman's Gallery...Youth's youth...Gad, sir, I've
been young myself...a fellow's got to go through his
apprenticeship...Own up now: women?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not women&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not even!" Mr. Raycie groaned. "All in pictures, then? Well,
say no more to me now...I'll get home, I'll get home..." He cast a
last apoplectic glance about the room. "The Raycie Gallery! That
pack of bones and mummers' finery!...Why, let alone the rest,
there's not a full-bodied female among 'em...Do you know what those
Madonna's of yours are like, my son? Why, there ain't one of 'em
that don't remind me of a bad likeness of poor Treeshy Kent...I
should say you'd hired half the sign-painters of Europe to do her
portrait for you&mdash;if you could imagine your wanting it...No,
sir! I don't need your arm," Mr. Raycie snarled, heaving his great
bulk painfully across the hall. He withered Lewis with a last look
from the doorstep. "And to buy THAT you overdrew your
account?&mdash;No, I'll drive home alone."</p>

<h3>7.</h3>

<p>MR. RAYCIE did not die till nearly a year later; but New York
agreed it was the affair of the pictures that had killed him.</p>

<p>The day after his first and only sight of them he sent for his
lawyer, and it became known that he had made a new will. Then he
took to his bed with a return of the gout, and grew so rapidly
worse that it was thought "only proper" to postpone the party Mrs.
Raycie was to have given that autumn to inaugurate the gallery.
This enabled the family to pass over in silence the question of the
works of art themselves; but outside of the Raycie house, where
they were never mentioned, they formed, that winter, a frequent and
fruitful topic of discussion.</p>

<p>Only two persons besides Mr. Raycie were known to have seen
them. One was Mr. Donaldson Kent, who owed the privilege to the
fact of having once been in Italy; the other, Mr. Reedy, the agent,
who had unpacked the pictures. Mr. Reedy, beset by Raycie cousins
and old family friends, had replied with genuine humility: "Why,
the truth is, I never was taught to see any difference between one
picture and another, except as regards the size of them; and these
struck me as smallish...on the small side, I would say..."</p>

<p>Mr. Kent was known to have unbosomed himself to Mr. Raycie with
considerable frankness&mdash;he went so far, it was rumoured, as to
declare that he had never seen any pictures in Italy like those
brought back by Lewis, and begged to doubt if they really came from
there. But in public he maintained that noncommittal attitude which
passed for prudence, but proceeded only from timidity; no one ever
got anything from him but the guarded statement: "The subjects are
wholly inoffensive."</p>

<p>It was believed that Mr. Raycie dared not consult the Huzzards.
Young John Huzzard had just brought home a Raphael; it would have
been hard not to avoid comparisons which would have been too
galling. Neither to them, nor to anyone else, did Mr. Raycie ever
again allude to the Raycie Gallery. But when his will was opened it
was found that he had bequeathed the pictures to his son. The rest
of his property was left absolutely to his two daughters. The bulk
of the estate was Mrs. Raycie's; but it was known that Mrs. Raycie
had had her instructions, and among them, perhaps, was the order to
fade away in her turn after six months of widowhood. When she had
been laid beside her husband in Trinity church-yard her will (made
in the same week as Mr. Raycie's, and obviously at his dictation)
was found to allow five thousand dollars a year to Lewis during his
life-time; the residue of the fortune, which Mr. Raycie's thrift
and good management had made into one of the largest in New York,
was divided between the daughters. Of these, the one promptly
married a Kent and the other a Huzzard; and the latter, Sarah Ann
(who had never been Lewis's favourite), was wont to say in later
years: "Oh, no, I never grudged my poor brother those funny old
pictures. You see, we have a Raphael."</p>

<p>The house stood on the corner of Third Avenue and Tenth Street.
It had lately come to Lewis Raycie as his share in the property of
a distant cousin, who had made an "old New York will" under which
all his kin benefited in proportion to their consanguinity. The
neighbourhood was unfashionable, and the house in bad repair; but
Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Raycie, who, since their marriage, had been
living in retirement at Tarrytown, immediately moved into it.</p>

<p>Their arrival excited small attention. Within a year of his
father's death, Lewis had married Treeshy Kent. The alliance had
not been encouraged by Mr. and Mrs. Kent, who went so far as to say
that their niece might have done better; but as that one of their
sons who was still unmarried had always shown a lively sympathy for
Treeshy, they yielded to the prudent thought that, after all, it
was better than having her entangle Bill.</p>

<p>The Lewis Raycies had been four years married, and during that
time had dropped out of the memory of New York as completely as if
their exile had covered half a century. Neither of them had ever
cut a great figure there. Treeshy had been nothing but the Kent's
Cinderella, and Lewis's ephemeral importance, as heir to the Raycie
millions, had been effaced by the painful episode which resulted in
his being deprived of them.</p>

<p>So secluded was their way of living, and so much had it come to
be a habit, that when Lewis announced that he had inherited Uncle
Ebenezer's house his wife hardly looked up from the baby-blanket
she was embroidering.</p>

<p>"Uncle Ebenezer's house in New York?"</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath. "Now I shall be able to show the
pictures."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lewis&mdash;" She dropped the blanket. "Are we going to
live there?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. But the house is so large that I shall turn the two
corner rooms on the ground floor into a gallery. They are very
suitably lighted. It was there that Cousin Ebenezer was laid
out."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lewis&mdash;"</p>

<p>If anything could have made Lewis Raycie believe in his own
strength of will it was his wife's attitude. Merely to hear that
unquestioning murmur of submission was to feel something of his
father's tyrannous strength arise in him; but with the wish to use
it more humanely.</p>

<p>"You'll like that, Treeshy? It's been dull for you here, I
know."</p>

<p>She flushed up. "Dull? With YOU, darling. Besides, I like the
country. But I shall like Tenth Street too. Only&mdash;you said
there were repairs?"</p>

<p>He nodded sternly. "I shall borrow money to make them. If
necessary&mdash;" he lowered his voice&mdash;"I shall mortgage the
pictures."</p>

<p>He saw her eyes fill. "Oh, but it won't be! There are so many
ways still in which I can economize."</p>

<p>He laid his hand on hers and turned his profile toward her,
because he knew it was so much stronger than his full face. He did
not feel sure that she quite grasped his intention about the
pictures; was not even certain that he wished her to. He went in to
New York every week now, occupying himself mysteriously and
importantly with plans, specifications and other business
transactions with long names; while Treeshy, through the hot summer
months, sat in Tarrytown and waited for the baby.</p>

<p>A little girl was born at the end of the summer and christened
Louisa; and when she was a few weeks old the Lewis Raycies left the
country for New York.</p>

<p>"NOW!" thought Lewis, as they bumped over the cobblestones of
Tenth Street in the direction of Cousin Ebenezer's house.</p>

<p>The carriage stopped, he handed out his wife, the nurse followed
with the baby, and they all stood and looked up at the
house-front.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lewis&mdash;" Treeshy gasped; and even little Louisa set up
a sympathetic wail.</p>

<p>Over the door&mdash;over Cousin Ebenezer's respectable,
conservative and intensely private front-door&mdash;hung a large
sign-board bearing, in gold letters on a black ground, the
inscription:</p>

<p>GALLERY OF CHRISTIAN ART. OPEN ON WEEK-DAYS FROM 2 TO 4.
ADMISSION 25 CENTS. CHILDREN 10 CENTS.</p>

<p>Lewis saw his wife turn pale, and pressed her arm in his.
"Believe me, it's the only way to make the pictures known. And they
MUST be made known," he said with a thrill of his old ardour.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, of course. But...to every one. Publicly?"</p>

<p>"If we showed them only to our friends, of what use would it be?
Their opinion is already formed."</p>

<p>She sighed her acknowledgment. "But the...the entrance
fee..."</p>

<p>"If we can afford it later, the gallery will be free. But
meanwhile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lewis, I quite understand!" And clinging to him, the
still-protesting baby in her wake, she passed with a dauntless step
under the awful sign-board.</p>

<p>"At last I shall see the pictures properly lighted!" she
exclaimed, and turned in the hall to fling her arms about her
husband.</p>

<p>"It's all they need...to be appreciated," he answered, aglow
with her encouragement.</p>

<p>Since his withdrawal from the world it had been a part of
Lewis's system never to read the daily papers. His wife eagerly
conformed to his example, and they lived in a little air-tight
circle of aloofness, as if the cottage at Tarrytown had been
situated in another and happier planet.</p>

<p>Lewis, nevertheless, the day after the opening of the Gallery of
Christian Art, deemed it his duty to derogate from this attitude,
and sallied forth secretly to buy the principal journals. When he
re-entered his house he went straight up to the nursery where he
knew that, at that hour, Treeshy would be giving the little girl
her bath. But it was later than he supposed. The rite was over, the
baby lay asleep in its modest cot, and the mother sat crouched by
the fire, her face hidden in her hands. Lewis instantly guessed
that she too had seen the papers.</p>

<p>"Treeshy&mdash;you mustn't...consider this of any
consequence...," he stammered.</p>

<p>She lifted a tear-stained face. "Oh, my darling! I thought you
never read the papers."</p>

<p>"Not usually. But I thought it my duty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; I see. But, as you say, what earthly
consequence&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"None, whatever; we must just be patient and persist."</p>

<p>She hesitated, and then, her arms about him, her head on his
breast; "Only, dearest, I've been counting up again, ever so
carefully; and even if we give up fires everywhere but in the
nursery, I'm afraid the wages of the door-keeper and the
guardian...especially if the gallery's open to the public every
day..."</p>

<p>"I've thought of that already, too; and I myself shall hereafter
act as doorkeeper and guardian."</p>

<p>He kept his eyes on hers as he spoke. "This is the test," he
thought. Her face paled under its brown glow, and the eyes dilated
in her effort to check her tears. Then she said gaily: "That will
be...very interesting, won't it, Lewis? Hearing what the people
say...Because, as they begin to know the pictures better, and to
understand them, they can't fail to say very interesting
things...can they?" She turned and caught up the sleeping Louisa.
"Can they...oh, you darling&mdash;darling?"</p>

<p>Lewis turned away too. Not another woman in New York would have
been capable of that. He could hear all the town echoing with this
new scandal of his showing the pictures himself&mdash;and she, so
much more sensitive to ridicule, so much less carried away by
apostolic ardour, how much louder must that mocking echo ring in
her ears! But his pang was only momentary. The one thought that
possessed him for any length of time was that of vindicating
himself by making the pictures known; he could no longer fix his
attention on lesser matters. The derision of illiterate journalists
was not a thing to wince at; once let the pictures be seen by
educated and intelligent people, and they would speak for
themselves&mdash;especially if he were at hand to interpret
them.</p>

<h3>8.</h3>

<p>FOR a week or two a great many people came to the gallery; but,
even with Lewis as interpreter, the pictures failed to make
themselves heard. During the first days, indeed, owing to the
unprecedented idea of holding a paying exhibition in a private
house, and to the mockery of the newspapers, the Gallery of
Christian Art was thronged with noisy curiosity-seekers; once the
astonished metropolitan police had to be invited in to calm their
comments and control their movements. But the name of "Christian
Art" soon chilled this class of sightseer, and before long they
were replaced by a dumb and respectable throng, who roamed vacantly
through the rooms and out again, grumbling that it wasn't worth the
money. Then these too diminished; and once the tide had turned, the
ebb was rapid. Every day from two to four Lewis still sat shivering
among his treasures, or patiently measured the length of the
deserted gallery: as long as there was a chance of any one coming
he would not admit that he was beaten. For the next visitor might
always be the one who understood.</p>

<p>One snowy February day he had thus paced the rooms in unbroken
solitude for above an hour when carriage-wheels stopped at the
door. He hastened to open it, and in a great noise of silks his
sister Sarah Anne Huzzard entered.</p>

<p>Lewis felt for a moment as he used to under his father's glance.
Marriage and millions had given the moon-faced Sarah some of the
Raycie awfulness; but her brother looked into her empty eyes, and
his own kept their level.</p>

<p>"Well, Lewis," said Mrs. Huzzard with a simpering sternness, and
caught her breath.</p>

<p>"Well, Sarah Anne&mdash;I'm happy that you've come to take a
look at my pictures."</p>

<p>"I've come to see you and your wife." She gave another nervous
gasp, shook out her flounces, and added in a rush: "And to ask you
how much longer this...this spectacle is to continue..."</p>

<p>"The exhibition?" Lewis smiled. She signed a flushed assent.</p>

<p>"Well, there has been a considerable falling-off lately in the
number of visitors&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" she interjected.</p>

<p>"But as long as I feel that any one wishes to come...I shall be
here...to open the door, as you see."</p>

<p>She sent a shuddering glance about her. "Lewis&mdash;I wonder if
you realize...?"</p>

<p>"Oh, fully."</p>

<p>"Then WHY do you go on? Isn't it enough&mdash;aren't you
satisfied?"</p>

<p>"With the effect they have produced?"</p>

<p>"With the effect YOU have produced&mdash;on your family and on
the whole of New York. With a slur on poor Papa's memory."</p>

<p>"Papa left me the pictures, Sarah Anne."</p>

<p>"Yes. But not to make yourself a mountebank about them."</p>

<p>Lewis considered this impartially. "Are you sure? Perhaps, on
the contrary, he did if for that very reason."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't heap more insults on our father's memory! Things are
bad enough without that. How your wife can allow it I can't see. Do
you ever consider the humiliation to HER?"</p>

<p>Lewis gave another dry smile. "She's used to being humiliated.
The Kents accustomed her to that."</p>

<p>Sarah Anne reddened. "I don't know why I should stay and be
spoken to in this way. But I came with my husband's approval."</p>

<p>"Do you need that to come and see your brother?"</p>

<p>"I need it to&mdash;to make the offer I am about to make; and
which he authorizes."</p>

<p>Lewis looked at her in surprise, and she purpled up to the lace
ruffles inside her satin bonnet.</p>

<p>"Have you come to make an offer for my collection?" he asked her
humorously.</p>

<p>"You seem to take pleasure in insinuating preposterous things.
But anything is better than this public slight on our name." Again
she ran a shuddering glance over the pictures. "John and I," she
announced, "are prepared to double the allowance mother left you on
condition that this...this ends...for good. That that horrible sign
is taken down tonight."</p>

<p>Lewis seemed mildly to weigh the proposal. "Thank you very much,
Sarah Anne," he said at length. "I'm touched...touched and...and
surprised...that you and John should have made this offer. But
perhaps, before I decline it, you will accept MINE: simply to show
you my pictures. When once you've looked at them I think you'll
understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Huzzard drew back hastily, her air of majesty collapsing.
"Look at the pictures? Oh, thank you...but I can see them very well
from here. And besides, I don't pretend to be a judge..."</p>

<p>"Then come up and see Treeshy and the baby," said Lewis
quietly.</p>

<p>She stared at him, embarrassed. "Oh, thank you," she stammered
again; and as she prepared to follow him: "Then it's NO, really no,
Lewis? Do consider, my dear! You say yourself that hardly any one
comes. What harm can there be in closing the place?"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;when tomorrow the man may come who understands?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Huzzard tossed her plumes despairingly and followed him in
silence.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;Mary Adeline?" she exclaimed, pausing abruptly on
the threshold of the nursery. Treeshy, as usual, sat holding her
baby by the fire; and from a low seat opposite her rose a lady as
richly furred and feathered as Mrs. Huzzard, but with far less
assurance to carry off her furbelows. Mrs. Kent ran to Lewis and
laid her plump cheek against his, while Treeshy greeted Sarah
Anne.</p>

<p>"I had no idea you were here, Mary Adeline," Mrs. Huzzard
murmured. It was clear that she had not imparted her philanthropic
project to her sister, and was disturbed at the idea that Lewis
might be about to do so. "I just dropped in for a minute," she
continued, "to see that darling little pet of an angel
child&mdash;" and she enveloped the astonished baby in her ample
rustlings and flutterings.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to see you here, Sarah Anne," Mary Adeline
answered with simplicity.</p>

<p>"Ah, it's not for want of wishing that I haven't come before!
Treeshy knows that, I hope. But the cares of a household like
mine..."</p>

<p>"Yes, and it's been so difficult to get about in the bad
weather," Treeshy suggested sympathetically.</p>

<p>Mrs. Huzzard lifted the Raycie eyebrows. "Has it really? With
two pairs of horses one hardly notices the weather...Oh, the
pretty, pretty, PRETTY, baby!...Mary Adeline," Sarah Anne
continued, turning severely to her sister, "I shall be happy to
offer you a seat in my carriage if you're thinking of leaving."</p>

<p>But Mary Adeline was a married woman too. She raised her mild
head and her glance crossed her sister's quietly. "My own carriage
is at the door, thank you kindly, Sarah Anne," she said; and the
baffled Sarah Anne withdrew on Lewis's arm. But a moment later the
old habit of subordination reasserted itself. Mary Adeline's gentle
countenance grew as timorous as a child's, and she gathered up her
cloak in haste.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was too quick...I'm sure she meant it kindly," she
exclaimed, overtaking Lewis as he turned to come up the stairs; and
with a smile he stood watching his two sisters drive off together
in the Huzzard coach.</p>

<p>He returned to the nursery, where Treeshy was still crooning
over her daughter.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," he said, "what do you suppose Sarah Anne came
for?" And, in reply to her wondering gaze: "To buy me off from
showing the pictures!"</p>

<p>His wife's indignation took just the form he could have wished.
She simply went on with her rich cooing laugh and hugged the baby
tighter. But Lewis felt the perverse desire to lay a still greater
strain upon her loyalty.</p>

<p>"Offered to double my allowance, she and John, if only I'll take
down the sign!"</p>

<p>"No one shall touch the sign!" Treeshy flamed.</p>

<p>"Not till I do," said her husband grimly.</p>

<p>She turned about and scanned him with anxious eyes.
"Lewis...YOU?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear...they're right...it can't go on forever..." He
went up to her, and put his arm about her and the child. "You've
been braver than an army of heroes; but it won't do. The expenses
have been a good deal heavier than I was led to expect. And I...I
can't raise a mortgage on the pictures. Nobody will touch
them."</p>

<p>She met this quickly. "No; I know. That was what Mary Adeline
came about."</p>

<p>The blood rushed angrily to Lewis's temples. "Mary
Adeline&mdash;how the devil did SHE hear of it?"</p>

<p>"Through Mr. Reedy, I suppose. But you must not be angry. She
was kindness itself: she doesn't want you to close the gallery,
Lewis...that is, not as long as you really continue to believe in
it...She and Donald Kent will lend us enough to go on with for a
year longer. That is what she came to say."</p>

<p>For the first time since the struggle had begun, Lewis Raycie's
throat was choked with tears. His faithful Mary Adeline! He had a
sudden vision of her, stealing out of the house at High Point
before daylight to carry a basket of scraps to the poor Mrs. Edgar
Poe who was dying of a decline down the lane...He laughed aloud in
his joy.</p>

<p>"Dear old Mary Adeline! How magnificent of her! Enough to give
me a whole year more..." He pressed his wet cheek against his
wife's in a long silence. "Well, dear," he said at length, "it's
for you to say&mdash;do we accept?"</p>

<p>He held her off, questioningly, at arm's length, and her wan
little smile met his own and mingled with it.</p>

<p>"Of course we accept!"</p>

<h3>9.</h3>

<p>OF the Raycie family, which prevailed so powerfully in the New
York of the 'forties, only one of the name survived in my boyhood,
half a century later. Like so many of the descendants of the proud
little Colonial society, the Raycies had totally vanished,
forgotten by everyone but a few old ladies, one or two genealogists
and the sexton of Trinity Church, who kept the record of their
graves.</p>

<p>The Raycie blood was of course still to be traced in various
allied families: Kents, Huzzards, Cosbys and many others, proud to
claim cousinship with a "Signer," but already indifferent or
incurious as to the fate of his progeny. These old New Yorkers who
lived so well and spent their money so liberally, vanished like a
pinch of dust when they disappeared from their pews and their
dinner-tables.</p>

<p>If I happen to have been familiar with the name since my youth,
it is chiefly because its one survivor was a distant cousin of my
mother's, whom she sometimes took me to see on days when she
thought I was likely to be good because I had been promised a treat
for the morrow.</p>

<p>Old Miss Alethea Raycie lived in a house I had always heard
spoken of as "Cousin Ebenezer's." It had evidently, in its day,
been an admired specimen of domestic architecture; but was now
regarded as the hideous though venerable relic of a bygone age.
Miss Raycie, being crippled by rheumatism, sat above stairs in a
large cold room, meagrely furnished with beadwork tables, rosewood
etageres and portraits of pale sad-looking people in odd clothes.
She herself was large and saturnine, with a battlemented black lace
cap, and so deaf that she seemed a survival of forgotten days, a
Rosetta Stone to which the clue was lost. Even to my mother, nursed
in that vanished tradition, and knowing instinctively to whom Miss
Raycie alluded when she spoke of Mary Adeline, Sarah Anne or Uncle
Doctor, intercourse with her was difficult and languishing, and my
juvenile interruptions were oftener encouraged than reproved.</p>

<p>In the course of one of these visits my eye, listlessly roaming,
singled out among the pallid portraits a three-crayon drawing of a
little girl with a large forehead and dark eyes, dressed in a plaid
frock and embroidered pantalettes, and sitting on a grass-bank. I
pulled my mother's sleeve to ask who she was, and my mother
answered: "Ah, that was poor little Louisa Raycie, who died of a
decline. How old was little Louisa when she died, Cousin
Alethea?"</p>

<p>To batter this simple question into Cousin Alethea's brain was
the affair of ten laborious minutes; and when the job was done, and
Miss Raycie, with an air of mysterious displeasure, had dropped a
deep, "Eleven," my mother was too exhausted to continue. So she
turned to me to add, with one of the private smiles we kept for
each other: "It was the poor child who would have inherited the
Raycie Gallery." But to a little boy of my age this item of
information lacked interest, nor did I understand my mother's
surreptitious amusement.</p>

<p>This far-off scene suddenly came back to me last year, when, on
one of my infrequent visits to New York, I went to dine with my old
friend, the banker, John Selwyn, and came to an astonished stand
before the mantelpiece in his new library. "Hal-LO!" I said,
looking up at the picture above the chimney.</p>

<p>My host squared his shoulders, thrust his hands into his
pockets, and affected the air of modesty which people think it
proper to assume when their possessions are admired. "The Macrino
d'Alba? Y-yes...it was the only thing I managed to capture out of
the Raycie collection."</p>

<p>"The only thing? Well&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you should have seen the Mantegna; AND the Giotto; AND
the Piero della Francesca&mdash;hang it, one of the most beautiful
Piero della Francescas in the world...A girl in profile, with her
hair in a pearl net, against a background of columbines; THAT went
back to Europe&mdash;the National Gallery I believe. And the
Carpaccio, the most exquisite little St. George...that went to
California...LORD!" He sat down with the sigh of a hungry man
turned away from a groaning board. "Well, it nearly broke me buying
THIS!" he murmured, as if at least that fact were some
consolation.</p>

<p>I was turning over my early memories in quest of a clue to what
he spoke of as the Raycie collection, in a tone which implied that
he was alluding to objects familiar to all art-lovers.</p>

<p>Suddenly: "They weren't poor little Louisa's pictures, by any
chance?" I asked, remembering my mother's cryptic smile.</p>

<p>Selwyn looked at me perplexedly. "Who the deuce is poor little
Louisa?" And without waiting for my answer, he went on: "They were
that fool Netta Cosby's until a year ago&mdash;and she never even
knew it."</p>

<p>We looked at each other interrogatively, my friend perplexed at
my ignorance, and I now absorbed in trying to run down the
genealogy of Netta Cosby. I did so finally. "Netta Cosby&mdash;you
don't mean Netta Kent, the one who married Jim Cosby?"</p>

<p>"That's it. They were cousins of the Raycies', and she inherited
the pictures."</p>

<p>I continued to ponder. "I wanted awfully to marry her, the year
I left Harvard," I said presently, more to myself than to my
hearer.</p>

<p>"Well, if you had you'd have annexed a prize fool; AND one of
the most beautiful collections of Italian Primitives in the
world."</p>

<p>"In the world?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you wait till you see them; if you haven't already.
And I seem to make out that you haven't?&mdash;that you can't have.
How long have you been in Japan? Four years? I thought so. Well, it
was only last winter that Netta found out.</p>

<p>"Found out what?"</p>

<p>"What there was in old Alethea Raycie's attic. You must remember
the old Miss Raycie who lived in that hideous house in Tenth Street
when we were children. She was a cousin of your mother's, wasn't
she? Well, the old fool lived there for nearly half a century, with
five millions' worth of pictures shut up in the attic over her
head. It seems they'd been there ever since the death of a poor
young Raycie who collected them in Italy years and years ago. I
don't know much about the story; I never was strong on genealogy,
and the Raycies have always been rather dim to me. They were
everybody's cousins, of course; but as far as one can make out that
seems to have been their principal if not their only function.
Oh&mdash;and I suppose the Raycie Building was called after them;
only THEY didn't build it!</p>

<p>"But there was this one young fellow&mdash;I wish I could find
out more about him. All that Netta seems to know (or to care, for
that matter) is that when he was very young&mdash;barely out of
college&mdash;he was sent to Italy by his father to buy Old
Masters&mdash;in the 'forties, it must have been&mdash;and came
back with this extraordinary, this unbelievable collection...a boy
of that age!...and was disinherited by the old gentleman for
bringing home such rubbish. The young fellow and his wife died ever
so many years ago, both of them. It seems he was so laughed at for
buying such pictures that they went away and lived like hermits in
the depths of the country. There were some funny spectral portraits
of them that old Alethea had up in her bedroom. Netta showed me one
of them the last time I went to see her: a pathetic drawing of the
only child, an anaemic little girl with a big forehead. Jove, but
that must have been your little Louisa!"</p>

<p>I nodded. "In a plaid frock and embroidered pantalettes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, something of the sort. Well, when Louisa and her parents
died, I suppose the pictures went to old Miss Raycie. At any rate,
at some time or other&mdash;and it must have been longer ago than
you or I can remember&mdash;the old lady inherited them with the
Tenth Street house; and when SHE died, three or four years ago, her
relations found she'd never even been upstairs to look at
them."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Well, she died intestate, and Netta Kent&mdash;Netta
Cosby&mdash;turned out to be the next of kin. There wasn't much to
be got out of the estate (or so they thought) and, as the Cosby's
are always hard up, the house in Tenth Street had to be sold, and
the pictures were very nearly sent off to the auction room with all
the rest of the stuff. But nobody supposed they would bring
anything, and the auctioneer said that if you tried to sell
pictures with carpets and bedding and kitchen furniture it always
depreciated the whole thing; and so, as the Cosbys had some bare
walls to cover, they sent for the whole lot&mdash;there were about
thirty&mdash;and decided to have them cleaned and hang them up.
'After all,' Netta said, 'as well as I can make out through the
cobwebs, some of them look like rather jolly copies of early
Italian things.' But as she was short of cash she decided to clean
them at home instead of sending them to an expert; and one day,
while she was operating on this very one before you, with her
sleeves rolled up, the man called, who always DOES call on such
occasions; the man who knows. In the given case, it was a quiet
fellow connected with the Louvre, who'd brought her a letter from
Paris, and whom she'd invited to one of her stupid dinners. He was
announced, and she thought it would be a joke to let him see what
she was doing; she has pretty arms, you may remember. So he was
asked into the dining-room, where he found her with a pail of hot
water and soap-suds, and THIS laid out on the table; and the first
thing he did was to grab her pretty arm so tight that it was black
and blue, while he shouted out: 'God in heaven! Not HOT
water!'"</p>

<p>My friend leaned back with a sigh of mingled resentment and
satisfaction, and we sat silently looking up at the lovely
"Adoration" above the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"That's how I got it a little cheaper&mdash;most of the old
varnish was gone for good. But luckily for her it was the first
picture she had attacked; and as for the others&mdash;you must see
them, that's all I can say...Wait; I've got the catalogue somewhere
about..."</p>

<p>He began to rummage for it, and I asked, remembering how nearly
I had married Netta Kent: "Do you mean to say she didn't keep a
single one of them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;in the shape of pearls and Rolls-Royces. And
you've seen their new house in Fifth Avenue?" He ended with a grin
of irony: "The best joke is that Jim was just thinking of divorcing
her when the pictures were discovered."</p>

<p>"Poor little Louisa!" I sighed.</p>
