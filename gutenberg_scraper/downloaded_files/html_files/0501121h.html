  <h2><a name="chap01"
     id="chap01">I. A PROPOSAL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"You have beauty," said Mr. Maurice Tarn carefully, "you
  have youth. You will in all probability survive me by many years. I am not
  the kind of man who would object to your marrying again. That would be sheer
  selfishness, and I am not selfish. When I die you will have great property;
  whilst I live you shall enjoy my wealth to its full. Possibly you have never
  looked upon me in the light of a husband, but it is not unusual for a
  guardian to marry his ward, and the disparity in our ages is not an
  insuperable obstacle."</p>

  <p>He spoke like one who was reciting a carefully rehearsed speech, and Elsa
  Marlowe listened, stunned.</p>

  <p>If the old-fashioned sideboard had of its own volition stood on end, if
  Elgin Crescent had been suddenly transported to the suburbs of Bagdad, she
  could not have been more astounded. But Elgin Crescent was in Bayswater, and
  the gloomy dining-room of Maurice Tarn's maisonette remained undisturbed; and
  here was Maurice Tarn himself, sitting on the other side of the breakfast
  table, an unshaven, shabby man of fifty-six, whose trembling hand, that went
  automatically to his shaggy grey moustache, was an eloquent reminder of his
  last night's carouse (there were three empty bottles on the table of his
  study when she looked in that morning), and he was proposing marriage.</p>

  <p>She could only gaze at him open-eyed, scarcely believing the evidence of
  her senses.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think I am mad," he went on slowly. "I've given a lot of
  thought to it, Elsa. You are heart-free, as I know. There is no reason in the
  world, except&mdash;except the difference in our ages, why this should not
  be."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but, Mr. Tarn," she stammered, "I had no idea... of course it
  is impossible!"</p>

  <p>Was he still drunk? she wondered, without a tremor of apprehension, for
  fifteen years of association with Maurice Tarn had not tended to increase her
  awe for him; if she had not been so staggered by this proposal which had come
  like a bolt from the blue, she might have been amused.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to marry you, I don't want to marry anybody. It is
  very&mdash;very kind of you, and of course I feel"&mdash;she could hardly
  bring her lips to say the word&mdash;"honoured. But it is too ridiculous!"
  she burst forth.</p>

  <p>His tired eyes were watching her, and he did not even flinch at the
  word.</p>

  <p>"I'm going away to&mdash;somewhere. I've got to go away for&mdash;for my
  health. Since Major Amery has come into the firm it is impossible to
  continue."</p>

  <p>"Does Ralph know this&mdash;that you're going away?" she asked, curiosity
  overcoming her amazement.</p>

  <p>"No!" He almost shouted the word. "He doesn't, he mustn't know! You
  understand, Elsa? Under no circumstances must Ralph know&mdash;what I have
  said to you is confidential. Think it over."</p>

  <p>With a gesture he dismissed the subject, to her great relief. For fully
  ten minutes she sat staring out of the window. Mr. Maurice Tarn's dining-room
  looked out upon the garden of Elgin Crescent, a garden common to all the
  houses that backed upon it. It was not a garden in the strictest sense of the
  word, being no more than a stretch of worn grass, intersected by brown paths;
  and its chief value was best appreciated by the parents of very young
  children. On sunny days the shade of the big tree in the centre of the garden
  was a favourite resting-place for nursemaids and their tiny charges. At this
  hour the garden was deserted. The pale yellow sunlight, slanting through the
  big window, lit a diagonal patch on the table, and gave to the spring flowers
  that, by a movement of her chair, mercifully hid Mr. Maurice Tarn from her
  view, the glory which belonged to them.</p>

  <p>She stole a glance at him past the flowery screen. He was wearing
  yesterday's collar&mdash;he invariably made a collar last three days; and his
  rusty black cravat was fastened behind with a tarnished buckle. The lapels of
  his ancient frock-coat shone with much wear; his cuffs showed ragged threads.
  Speculatively and, for her, cold-bloodedly, she examined him in the light of
  a possible bridegroom and shuddered.</p>

  <p>Elsa had preserved toward her guardian and his habits an attitude of
  philosophical patience. She had grown tired of urging the purchase of
  clothes. He had a fairly good income, and once she had surprised the
  information that he had a substantial balance at his bank. But by nature and
  habits he was miserly. She owed him something... but not much: an education
  at the cheapest boarding-school he could find; a dress allowance reluctantly
  given; an annual holiday at Clacton fortnight in a crowded boarding-house;
  and a post-graduate course in short hand and typewriting which was to fit her
  for the position of a private secretary to old Amery. In addition to these
  things, Maurice Tarn gave her what he was pleased to call "a home."</p>

  <p>She had often wondered what freak of generosity had induced him to adopt
  the orphan child of a distant cousin, but the nearest she had ever reached to
  explaining that fit of altruism was when he told her, one evening, that he
  hated complete loneliness and preferred a child in the house to a dog.</p>

  <p>He was apparently absorbed in the devilled chicken he was cutting into
  microscopic pieces, for presently he asked:</p>

  <p>"Is there anything in the paper?"</p>

  <p>He himself never read the newspapers, and it had been part of her duty for
  years to supply him with the principal items of the morning's news.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she said. "You know about the parliamentary crisis?"</p>

  <p>He growled something under his breath, and then:</p>

  <p>"Nothing else?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except the drug scandal," she said.</p>

  <p>He looked up suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Drug scandal? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>She picked up the newspaper from the floor where she had dropped it.</p>

  <p>"It is about two gangs that are importing drugs into this country&mdash;I
  didn't think you'd be interested in that," she said, searching for the
  paragraph.</p>

  <p>She happened at that moment to look across at him, and nearly dropped the
  paper in her surprise. Mr. Maurice Tarn's complexion was one of consistent
  sallowness, but now his face was a deathly white. His jaw had dropped, his
  eyes were staring.</p>

  <p>"Two gangs?" he croaked. "What do you mean? Read it, read it!" he
  commanded huskily.</p>

  <p>"I thought&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"Never mind what you thought, read it!" snarled Tarn.</p>

  <p>Masking her astonishment, she found the item. It was a half-column on the
  top of the principal page:</p>

  <p>"Yesterday morning Detective-Inspector Bickerson, accompanied by half a
  dozen police officers, made a raid upon a small warehouse in Whitechapel,
  and, after arresting the caretaker, conducted a search of the premises. It is
  understood that a considerable quantity of opium and a package containing 16
  pounds of cocaine were seized and removed, and it is believed that the
  warehouse was a distributing centre used by one of the two gangs which are
  engaged in putting illicit drugs upon the market, both here and in America.
  The police believe that one of these nefarious associations is conducted by a
  Japanese merchant named Soyoka, who, however, is the merest figure-head in
  the business, the operations being carried out by a number of unknown men,
  said to occupy good social positions, and two of whom are believed to be
  officials in the Indian Civil Service. The composition of the second gang,
  which during the past two years has amassed a considerable fortune, is not so
  well known. Behind these two organisations are hundreds of agents, and a
  small army of desperadoes are employed to cover the gangs' workings. The
  recent arrest of a Greek in Cleveland, Ohio, and his confession to the
  Federal authorities has enabled Scotland Yard to get a line on the British
  branch of the 'business.' From the statement of the Greek Poropoulos, it is
  believed that the heads of the second gang include an English doctor and a
  leading merchant of the City of London&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>It was not a groan, it was not a sigh, but something that combined the
  quality of both. Elsa looked up and saw her guardian's head sinking over the
  table, and sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He waved her aside.</p>

  <p>"Get me some brandy&mdash;in the cupboard of my study," he mumbled, and
  she hurried into the stuffy little room, returning with a tumbler half-
  filled, the contents of which he swallowed at a gulp.</p>

  <p>Slowly the colour came back to his face, and he could force a smile.</p>

  <p>"You're responsible," he grunted, with heavy pleasantry. "A fellow of my
  age doesn't propose at this time of the morning without feeling the
  effects&mdash;eh? A little too old for love-making, I guess. Think it over,
  Elsa. I've been a good friend of yours."</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to read any more?"</p>

  <p>He stopped her with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"Stuff! A newspaper invention: these fellows are always out for sensation.
  They live on it."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet with an effort.</p>

  <p>"I shall see you at the office," he said. "Think it over, Elsa." The door
  of his study slammed behind him&mdash;he was still in his locked room when
  the girl boarded an eastward bound 'bus that carried her almost to the door
  of the Amery Corporation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02">II. THE HOUSE OF AMERY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE house of Amery &amp; Amery stands where it stood in the
  days when its founder marshalled his apprentices and clerks to fight the
  Great Fire of London, so that, when the holocaust had smouldered to ashes,
  the cramped old house alone raised its head amidst the blackened ruins of
  Wood Street. Improvements had come with the years, an exigent City Council
  had demanded certain structural alterations, but in appearance the Amery
  building remained what it was in the days when the "Mayflower" set forth from
  Plymouth Harbour and narrowly missed fouling the "Pleasant Endeavour," the
  first of the Amery Brothers' fleet of East Indiamen.</p>

  <p>The centuries had seen many fluctuations in the fortunes of the house. One
  evening at White's, in the days of the Regency, an Amery had diced the fleet
  out of existence; later, another Amery had won back its equivalent in the tea
  trade; but the narrow-fronted house, with its uneven floors, its poky little
  cupboards and presses, its low ceilings and tortuous stairways, defied the
  passage of time.</p>

  <p>Above the thick green glass window panes that admitted light and distorted
  vision the faded inscription "Amery &amp; Amery, Shippers &amp; Importers,"
  appeared in the identical lettering that an Amery had chosen on the day
  George the Third went to his rest. The little room where Elsa Marlowe
  attended to the private correspondence of the newest proprietor had been
  furnished in his youth by a chief clerk who, as an old man, had seen the
  first policeman on the streets of London.</p>

  <p>Elsa, sitting before her worn writing-table one morning in late spring,
  when the sunlight poured into the room, seemed as much out of place in the
  grim setting as the bunch of lilies of the valley she had arranged in a cheap
  glass vase beside the typewriter.</p>

  <p>There was a sculptor in Paris who specialised in dainty statuettes of slim
  Parisiennes, and she might have posed for M. Milliêre, a straight-backed,
  long-limbed girl, with the tilted chin, the straight nose, the large,
  enquiring eyes and the confusion of spun gold hair he loved.</p>

  <p>She had that complexion which made wise and sceptical women look twice at
  her; yet her pink and white owed nothing to artifice, and the rich red of her
  mouth was as everlasting as the deep grey-blue of her eyes.</p>

  <p>Her forehead was puckered as she listened to her voluble companion. She
  was never quite comfortable when Miss Dame came to her favourite topic of
  discussion, though the gaunt woman expressed much that she thought.</p>

  <p>Elsa Marlowe was not prepared to accept Miss Dame's judgment on any other
  subject than stenography. Her views on human affairs were inclined to be
  coloured by the peculiar brand of romance she had absorbed overnight. But
  when she described the house of Amery &amp; Amery as "creepy," and spoke of
  Paul Roy Amery as a "sinister figure," Elsa found herself ranged on the side
  of Romance.</p>

  <p>"You can laugh about the pitchers," said Miss Dame earnestly, "but you get
  ideas of Life out of 'em... types, characters, if you understand me? It's
  experience to a young girl like me. The villains I've seen!... My Gawd! But
  I've never seen anybody like the Major. Sinister! You've only to look at him,
  Miss Marlowe. And why your dear good uncle, the finest gentleman that ever
  breathed&mdash;more like The'dore Roberts 'n anybody I know&mdash;should let
  you stay in this place, is more'n I can understand. See what I mean?"</p>

  <p>Miss Dame glared fearfully through her big rimless spectacles. Her large
  mouth was grotesquely open, her little button of a nose redder than ever. She
  was tall, round-shouldered, awkwardly made. Her hands and feet were large;
  her bobbed hair, refusing to behave as bobbed hair should, spread fan-wise
  from her head.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't call him 'sinister,'" said Elsa thoughtfully; "he is certainly
  unpleasant. I don't think he is used to dealing with white people&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's what I say," broke in Miss Dame. "Niggers and black people an'
  Injuns! I'll bet he lashes 'em to death. I've seen it done. Do you remember
  the 'Monster of the Marsh'? Anna Conseuello was in it. Oh, it was perfectly
  marvellous! This monster took her to an 'ut and tied her up, and
  Frank&mdash;that was her fiancy, that was misjudged by her owing to her
  seeing him kiss his sister that she didn't know anything about&mdash;he rode
  all night with a sheriff's possy&mdash;the way they flew across the hills was
  perfectly marvellous&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elsa's soft laughter interrupted her.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, he's sinister," said Miss Dame firmly, "and so is this building.
  Hundreds of years old&mdash;there ain't a floor that's level or a door that
  fits; and look at the poky little windows and the beams over the ceiling. And
  there's no proper washing place, and in the heart of the City too! Where did
  he come from, anyway? Old Mr. Amery never said he had a nephew, and your dear
  uncle was that surprised when the will was read that he could have dropped.
  He told me so himself."</p>

  <p>For the moment her "dear uncle" was as unpleasant a subject as the
  sinister Mr. Amery. It was accepted by the employees of Amery's that Mr. Tarn
  and she were uncle and niece, and she never attempted to correct that
  erroneous impression.</p>

  <p>"We shall get used to him," she said with a half sigh. "New people are
  always awkward at first. And probably he isn't used to business. He had an
  official position in India. I know that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped. Here she was going beyond the bounds of propriety. She could
  not tell of the mysterious letters which Paul Amery dictated, letters in
  which whole lines were made up of unintelligible code words.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tarn knows something about him," Miss Dame nodded vigorously. "They
  were together hours yesterday&mdash;I heard 'em! Gee! The noise they
  made!"</p>

  <p>Elsa turned startled eyes to the other.</p>

  <p>"Quarrelling?" she said incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Quarrelling!" repeated Miss Dame triumphantly. "You never heard anything
  like it! It was when you were out at lunch. When I say 'hours' I mean twenty
  minutes. I never saw your dear uncle so upset in my life."</p>

  <p>Elsa was not impressed. Mr. Maurice Tarn was easily upset in these days.
  Was she responsible for that? she thought whimsically. But a quarrel! Why
  should Amery quarrel with his general manager? They hardly knew one another,
  for Paul Amery had not occupied the presidential chair a month as yet, was
  new to the business and scarcely acquainted with its routine.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Before Miss Dame could answer, a bell shrilled and Elsa hastily gathered
  her notebook and pencil and passed into the lair of her ogre.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant room, carpeted in a dull blue that showed the polished
  black panelling to advantage. Over an old fireplace, a solemn-faced clock
  ticked sedately. The leaded windows were curtained with dark blue velvet; the
  only touch of gay colour in the room was the scarlet leather of the fender
  and seats.</p>

  <p>The man at the big writing-table was glowering at a letter on his
  blotting-pad, and, seemingly oblivious to her presence, was reading it over
  to himself, his thin lips moving silently as he assimilated every line, every
  word. A minute passed, and then Paul Amery looked up with that expression on
  his saturnine face which never failed to rouse in her breast something that
  was akin to fury. Not that he was consciously offensive&mdash;her resentment
  would have been excusable if he were.</p>

  <p>There was just the faintest hint of a sneer, a downward droop of the
  corners of his mouth that coincided with the lift of his upper lip, and a
  something&mdash;a cold, appraising something in his blue eyes that was
  altogether and yet indefinably insulting.</p>

  <p>She had surprised that expression before&mdash;invariably followed upon
  the interruption of a reverie. And Paul Amery's day-dreams were not pleasant.
  Only for a second did that twisted smile disfigure his thin dark face. In
  another second, it set like a mask of fate; except that the black brows had
  met in a frown that hardened and almost dehumanized him.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>His voice had the quality of granite. Instantly he had passed through the
  stage of transition between dreams and reality, and his eyes were searching
  hers suspiciously. There were people who would think he was good-looking, she
  thought, and was sufficient of a woman to concede this advantage to him. The
  hot sun of India had tanned his face to a permanent brown; it had given him,
  too, something of the character of the jungle beasts he had stalked&mdash;she
  never saw him come noiselessly, almost furtively, through the outer office
  without thinking of a cat&mdash;and she loathed cats.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>He never raised his voice; he did not display his impatience, but his
  "Yes?" was like the flick of a whip in her face.</p>

  <p>"You rang for me and you wished to see the bills of lading... Chi Fung and
  Lee, Mr. Amery," she stammered and despised herself for her deference.</p>

  <p>Without a word he reached out his hand and took the papers she had brought
  to him. Silently he examined them and then put them aside.</p>

  <p>"Why are you afraid of me?"</p>

  <p>The question stunned her; it was so unexpected, so utterly unanswerable
  that she could only stand and stare at him until, before the masterful blaze
  of his eyes, she lowered her own.</p>

  <p>"I'm not afraid of you, Mr. Amery," she said, and tried hard to keep her
  voice level. "What a queer thing to say! I'm&mdash;I'm not afraid of
  anybody." This defiantly.</p>

  <p>He did not speak. His very silence gave her the lie as plainly as if he
  had spoken.</p>

  <p>"Besides," she went on with the ghost of a smile, "isn't it the proper
  attitude of a secretary toward her employer? A wholesome respect ."</p>

  <p>She finished lamely, feeling a fool. He was looking through the window
  into the dusty sunlight of Wood Street. Apparently his attention was absorbed
  in the laden trucks that lined the narrow road; in the red-faced City
  policeman who was engineering a passage for a steam trolley; in the drab
  fascia of the office block opposite&mdash;in anything but one pink and white
  girl with a mop of fine, browny hair that defied regulation.</p>

  <p>"You are five feet three inches, he said, going off at a tangent.</p>

  <p>"Sixty-three inches! The little finger of your left hand is crooked
  &mdash;you must have broken it when you were a child. You live constantly in
  association with somebody who is deaf: your voice is just a little too
  strong. Of course, Mr. Maurice Tarn! I have noticed that he is deaf."</p>

  <p>Elsa drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Shall I leave the bills of lading, please?" she asked.</p>

  <p>His eyes were no longer on her face. They had dropped moodily to the
  blotter.</p>

  <p>"No... I wanted you. Take this letter to Fing Li T'sin, 796 Bubbling Well
  Road, Shanghai&mdash;'Tang chiang chin ping ch'ang&mdash;'I beg your pardon,
  you do not understand Chinese, of course?"</p>

  <p>He was not joking. She saw him flush with annoyance at his mistake
  &mdash;at the possibility that she might think he was being funny at her
  expense.</p>

  <p>"He reads and speaks English better than you&mdash;or I, for the matter of
  that," he added hurriedly. "Take this. 'I am looking for a trustworthy man to
  cover the Nangpoo province. Feng Ho has arrived&mdash;you may send letters to
  him here. When you see the Long Sword of Sun Yat tell him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here he paused, and passed a slip of paper across to her. Carefully
  pencilled in capital letters were the words:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">"Barrow Tendency Makeshift Warlike Candle Stencil Pendant
  Maple Crest Hamlet Desire."</p><br>

  <p>He was looking at her as she read, a thin hand caressing the little black
  moustache that covered his upper lip, and as she raised her head she met his
  glance and went hot.</p>

  <p>"Nice job, this?" he asked absently. "Not too much work? Wages good?"</p>

  <p>It was the first time he had displayed the slightest interest in her.
  Hitherto she had had the feeling that he had regarded her as part of the
  movable fixtures of the establishment.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is a good job," she said awkwardly, and added (fatuously, as she
  told herself): "I hope my work is satisfactory?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer, and she added boorishness to his sins.</p>

  <p>"You knew my great-uncle, Bertram Amery, of course?"</p>

  <p>He was not looking at her; his eyes were still on the street below.
  "Slightly," she said. "I was here during the last few months of his life. He
  only came in for a few minutes each day."</p>

  <p>He nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"The ancient ran the business, of course?"</p>

  <p>"The ancient?" She frowned, and then realised that his flippant reference
  was to Mr. Maurice Tarn. "Mr. Tarn has always helped to run the business,"
  she said, a little stiffly, though heaven knew she was in no mood to feel
  offended because he spoke slightingly of her very distant relative.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tarn always helped to run the business," he repeated absently, and
  then jerked his head round to face her. "Thank you, that will do," he
  said.</p>

  <p>She was at the door when his voice arrested her.</p>

  <p>"How much does the Stanford Corporation pay you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She turned round, staring at him in wonder.</p>

  <p>"The Stanford Corporation, Mr. Amery?" His keen eyes searched her
  face.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said simply. "I see you do not know that enterprising
  business."</p>

  <p>He nodded to the door, and she was back at her desk before she realized
  the indignity of her dismissal.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap03"
     id="chap03">III. THE MENACE OF SOYOKA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">STANFORD Corporation! What did he mean? Did he suggest that
  she was secretly working for some other house? If she had been on better
  terms with her uncle, she might have solved the puzzle; but for the moment
  their relationship was more than a little strained.</p>

  <p>She was typing the letter when she heard the door of her room opened and
  closed, and, looking up, saw the tall, hollow-eyed man whom she had
  particularly wished to avoid that day.</p>

  <p>He stood for a while, fingering his bristling grey moustache, his small,
  faded eyes fixed moodily upon her, and then he came slowly across the room
  and towered above her. He was an unusually tall man, and, for the general
  manager of a prosperous business, shabbily attired. His cuffs were ragged at
  the ends, his black cravat rusty with age.</p>

  <p>"Where's Amery?" he asked, lowering his voice.</p>

  <p>"In his room, Mr. Tan."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" He fingered his bristly chin. "Did he say anything?"</p>

  <p>"About what?"</p>

  <p>"About anything," impatiently.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. It was in her mind to tell him about Major Amery's
  enquiry, but she could not bring herself to the point of taking him into her
  confidence.</p>

  <p>"Have you thought over the matter I spoke about this morning?" He stole a
  quick glance at her, and read her answer before she spoke.</p>

  <p>"No, it&mdash;it doesn't bear thinking about."</p>

  <p>He blinked at her, and his face twisted to an expression of pain.</p>

  <p>"Too old, I suppose? I'll make any arrangement you like, only I want
  company. I hate being alone. I want somebody I can talk to&mdash;a wife.
  Somebody I know I can trust. I've got to get things off my mind. They can't
  make a wife tell&mdash;you understand? Any arrangement," he emphasised the
  words and she grasped his meaning. But he was not looking at her as he spoke.
  That "any arrangement" promise was a lie. He wanted more than a trustworthy
  listener.</p>

  <p>She drew a long impatient sigh.</p>

  <p>"We needn't go back to that, need we?" she asked. "I wish you wouldn't,
  Mr. Tarn. It worries me terribly, and it is going to make life
  insupportable."</p>

  <p>He was still fingering his chin nervously, his eyes straying to the door
  of Paul Amery's room.</p>

  <p>"Is anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head irritably.</p>

  <p>"Wrong? What should there be wrong?" He glanced apprehensively toward the
  door. "I'm going in to see him."</p>

  <p>There was a note of defiance in his voice which surprised her. She had not
  seen this side of Maurice Tarn's character. She knew him best as a most
  self-possessed business man without imagination. At his worst, he was a
  slovenly domestic tyrant, with a passion for secret drinking. Yet here he
  was, bracing himself as for a great ordeal, the hand that touched his
  moustache trembling, his eyes fearful.</p>

  <p>"I've got to go away." His voice was lowered. "I don't know where,
  but&mdash;but&mdash;-somewhere."</p>

  <p>He heard the turn of the handle and looked round affrighted. Paul Amery
  stood in the doorway, that hateful smile of his upon his thin lips.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I wanted to see you, Major Amery."</p>

  <p>Without a word, Paul Amery opened the door a little further and his
  general manager went in. Amery closed the door behind him and walked slowly
  to his desk. He did not sit down but stood, his hands in his pockets, his
  head slightly bent forward, his cold eyes scrutinising the man.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>Twice the lips of the older man moved, and presently, in a half-unreal
  voice, he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I feel I owe you an apology for that&mdash;that scene which occurred
  yesterday, Major Amery. I fear I lost my temper; but you can quite understand
  that one who has held a trusted position in the house of Amery, who was
  respected, I venture to say, by your uncle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sit down."</p>

  <p>Mechanically the man obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tarn, I'm new to this business. I ought to have come over eight
  months ago, when my uncle died and the property passed in to my possession.
  There were certain things that I did not realise, but which I realise now. I
  looked upon Amery &amp; Amery as a corporation that could get along very well
  without me. I never looked upon Amerys as&mdash;an enemy I should have to
  fight."</p>

  <p>Maurice Tarn stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Fight? I don't understand you. An enemy, Major Amery?" he said
  tremulously.</p>

  <p>"Who is the Stanford Corporation?"</p>

  <p>The question rang out like a pistol shot, and Mr. Tarn winced, but did not
  answer</p>

  <p>"There is a business being carried on in a block of offices in
  Threadneedle Street," said Amery slowly; "not a very flourishing business,
  for the Stanford Corporation occupy one large room and employ no clerks. All
  the work is done by a mysterious individual who comes after most of the other
  offices are closed, and leaves just after midnight. He types his own letters,
  of which he keeps no copies; he has interviews with strange and disreputable
  people; and although the name of the Stanford Corporation does not appear in
  the books of Amery &amp; Amery, I am satisfied that our very reputable
  business"&mdash;his lips curled again&mdash;"built up by the labour of years,
  and founded on the honesty and integrity of my dead relatives, is a screen
  behind which a certain traffic is in progress."</p>

  <p>"Major Amery!" For a second Maurice Tarn's pose of virtuous indignation
  held, and then, before the glittering eyes of the other, he wilted. "If you
  feel that," he mumbled rapidly, "the best thing I can do is to get out. I've
  served this firm faithfully for thirty-five years, and I don't think you're
  treating me well. What traffic? I know the Stanford Corporation: I've just
  remembered them. They'rea perfectly straightforward firm."</p>

  <p>The lifted lips, the hard, smiling eyes silenced him.</p>

  <p>"You'll bluff to the last, eh? Well, so be it! Tarn, you're doing
  something of which I do not approve, and that is a mild way of putting it.
  And I'm going to stop you&mdash;I'm going to stop you if it means killing
  you! Do you get that? You know what I am&mdash;you guess a whole lot more
  than you know! You're in my way, Tarn. I didn't expect to find this obstacle
  here." He pointed to the floor, and Tarn knew that he was speaking about the
  house of Amery. "I'm going to put the matter plainly to you," he went on.
  "Fortunes are to be made, and are being made, by two gangs, who are running a
  dope industry. Maybe you saw something about it in the morning paper. Two
  gangs! There isn't room for two&mdash;is that clear to you?"</p>

  <p>Tarn's face had gone ashen; he was incapable of speech. The man by the
  writing-table was not looking at him: his eyes were fixed on the street
  below&mdash;he seemed to find in the life and hurry of Wood Street something
  of overpowering interest.</p>

  <p>"Not room for two&mdash;hardly room for one," he repeated. "The second
  gang had better shut up business and get out whilst the going's good. There
  are many dangers&mdash;Soyoka's crowd aren't going to take competition lying
  down. I am telling you this as a friend."</p>

  <p>Tarn licked his dry lips but did not answer.</p>

  <p>"The girl isn't in it?"</p>

  <p>"No." The older man blundered into this partial admission, "You're...
  Soyoka!" he breathed. "God! I didn't dream... I knew they were working from
  India and the East... but I never guessed..."</p>

  <p>His voice sank to an indistinguishable rumble of sound. Amery did not
  answer him: with a sideways jerk of his head he dismissed the man. Elsa saw
  him stagger through his office like one in a dream, and wondered what was the
  reason for his white face and trembling hands.</p>

  <p>Left alone, Amery walked slowly to his desk and sat down, his chin on his
  hands: Facing him on the wall hung a picture in an old-fashioned gilt
  frame&mdash;a portrait of an elderly man in a long, flowing wig; he wore a
  coat of homely brown, lace ruffles swelled under his ample chin, and in his
  hand was a half-unrolled map of the world. The first of the Amerys! The last
  of the race looked up into the hard grey eyes of his ancestor, and he
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"Illustrious forbear"&mdash;with mock gravity&mdash;"the crooked house of
  Amery salutes you!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap04"
     id="chap04">IV. DR. RALPH HALLAM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was the custom of Amery's, and had been the custom from
  immemorial times, to allow the staff an hour and twenty-five minutes for
  luncheon. Nobody knew why this extra twenty-five minutes had been granted. It
  was a tradition of the house, and was a very welcome one to Elsa Marlowe that
  day, for she had decided to take counsel of the only man in the world who
  could help solve her problems.</p>

  <p>On the stroke of one o'clock she was out of the office and was hurrying
  toward Cheapside. Taxis there were in plenty, and with in fifteen minutes she
  was alighting at the door of a small house in Half Moon Street. Scarcely had
  she paid the driver than the door was opened and a good-looking man of thirty
  was half way across the sidewalk to meet her.</p>

  <p>"This is a miracle! Has the noble house of Amery gone bust?"</p>

  <p>She preceded him into the house, and not until she was in the sedate
  little dining-room did she answer.</p>

  <p>"Everything has gone bust, Ralph&mdash;no, my dear, I couldn't eat. Go on
  with your lunch and I will talk."</p>

  <p>"I have had my lunch&mdash;bring something for Miss Marlowe," ordered Dr.
  Ralph Hallam, and, when his man had gone, he asked anxiously: "What is
  wrong?"</p>

  <p>She had known Ralph Hallam in the days when she was a lank school-girl. A
  friend of her "uncle's" and a frequent visitor to their house in Bayswater,
  they had grown up together. He was, by his own confession, so inefficient a
  doctor that he had never practised since the day he left hospital. A keen
  business man, he had employed the small fortune which his mother had left to
  him to such advantage that he could afford to dispense with the problematical
  income which might have come to him from his profession.</p>

  <p>A fair-haired, clear-eyed man of something over thirty, his boyish,
  clean-shaven face and irrepressible good-humour gave him the impression of
  one who had not left his teens very far behind.</p>

  <p>"You're not ill, are you?" he asked, and when she shook her head smilingly
  he sighed his relief. "Thank heavens! I should be obliged to call in a real
  doctor if you were."</p>

  <p>All the time he was speaking he was disposing of her fur, her gloves, her
  handbag, in his helpless way.</p>

  <p>"You know that Mr. Tarn isn't really my uncle?"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" He stared at her. "Oh, yes&mdash;your cousin or something, isn't he?
  Queer old devil&mdash;doesn't he bore you?"</p>

  <p>"Ralph&mdash;he wants to marry me!" she said tragically.</p>

  <p>He had taken a wine-glass from the sideboard and was putting it on the
  table when she spoke. The glass dropped from his fingers and splintered to a
  thousand pieces. Looking at him, she saw his face go suddenly white.</p>

  <p>"I'm a clumsy fool." His voice was very steady. "Say that again. He wants
  to marry you&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;?</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Exactly&mdash;that! Isn't it hideously unbelievable? Oh, Ralph, I'm
  worried. Something queer has come over him in this past week. He has
  quarrelled with Mr. Amery&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Steady, steady, old girl. Sit down. Now tell me all about it. Quarrelled
  with Amery&mdash;that's the Indian fellow?"</p>

  <p>She told him as coherently as she could of the scene that had occurred
  that morning. Ralph Hallam whistled.</p>

  <p>"The old villain!" he said softly. "But what is the idea? Why this sudden
  desire for matrimony? He never struck me as a marrying man. And to be
  mistress of the menage at Elgin Crescent is not the most pleasant of
  prospects&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He is going abroad," she interrupted. "That is why he wants to marry in
  such a hurry&mdash;oh, I ought not to have told you that!"</p>

  <p>Too late, she remembered her guardian's injunction. But if Ralph Hallam
  was surprised by the news he did not betray himself.</p>

  <p>"You'll not marry him, of course. That kind of December doesn't belong to
  your kind of May, Elsa."</p>

  <p>It seemed to her that he was going to say something but checked himself.
  For a second she had a spasm of fear that the day would bring her a second
  proposal, for a meaning light had kindled in his expressive eyes. She liked
  Ralph Hallam... but not that way. He was so good, so kind, such a good pal,
  and it would spoil everything if the unspoken message was delivered. To her
  intense relief he spoke of Amery.</p>

  <p>"What kind of man is the Indian?" he asked. "Wasn't he in the Civil
  Service?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I know very little about him," she said. "None of us do. He was in India
  for years. They say he isn't even English&mdash;he belongs to the American
  branch of the Amerys, and it was old Mr. Amery who found him his position in
  India. He is so strange."</p>

  <p>Ralph Hallam smiled.</p>

  <p>"Mad, probably&mdash;most of these Indian fellows go daft. It is the
  sun."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, he isn't mad. His manners are awful&mdash;he is abrupt to the point
  of rudeness. And yet&mdash;Ralph, there is something queerly fascinating
  about him. I find myself wondering what his life must have been, what his
  recreations are: he seems to move in an atmosphere of mystery. I can't tell
  you what happens at the office&mdash;that wouldn't be fair&mdash;but his
  correspondence is so unusual. And he's magnetic. When he looks at me
  sometimes, I have the feeling that I'm... out of control. That sounds
  alarming, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It certainly does," smiled her puzzled companion. "Does he hypnotize
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Ye-es," she hesitated. "Perhaps that is it. He reminds me of some
  beautiful sleek animal, though he isn't at all beautiful! Sometimes HIs eyes
  are so cruel that I shudder, and sometimes they are so sad that I could
  weep&mdash;and generally he is so hateful that I loathe him." She laughed
  softly at her own inconsistency. "Jessie Dame calls him 'the sinister man,'
  and perhaps she is right. Sometimes I feel, when I am in his presence, that
  he has the burden of some terrible crime on his mind. He is so suspicious, so
  horribly unbelieving. When he asks you a question he gives you the impression
  that he is prepared for you to tell a lie. You feel that he is watching you
  all the time. Everything about him is that way. He wears shoes with thick
  rubber soles, and when he moves it is with a sort of stealthiness that makes
  you jump. Mr. Tarn hates him."</p>

  <p>"A singularly unpleasant person," said Ralph with a chuckle, "but
  impressive&mdash;don't lose your young heart to him. As to Tarn, I think it
  would be a good idea if you went away for a while. You have never met my
  sister-in-law?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know that you had one," she said, and he smiled.</p>

  <p>"You will like her," he said simply. "I'll get her to invite you over for
  a few days."</p>

  <p>The servant came in with a tray at that moment and, until they were alone,
  neither spoke. She had finished her lunch and had risen to go, when the sound
  of a taxi stopping at the door brought his eyes to the street.</p>

  <p>"Wait."</p>

  <p>She followed his glance, but from the angle at which she stood she could
  not see the figure that was paying the cabman.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"The admirable Tarn," he said. "I don't think he'd better see you here. Go
  into the library&mdash;you know your way. When I show him into the
  dining-room you can make your escape. I'll take care that he doesn't see
  you."</p>

  <p>There came the sound of the doorbell and she hurried into the little study
  and presently heard Maurice Tarn's deep voice in the passage. She waited a
  second, then, tiptoeing along the passage, opened the door and let herself
  out.</p>

  <p>Tarn, his nerves on edge, heard the thud of the closing door and looked
  round suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>"My man going out," said Ralph coolly. "What is your trouble?" For a while
  the other man did not answer; then, with a groan, he dropped into an easy
  chair and covered his face with his hands.</p>

  <p>"As bad as that, eh?" Ralph Hallam nodded.</p>

  <p>"He knows," said the muffled voice of Tarn.</p>

  <p>"Which 'he' is this? The Indian gentleman? he knows?"</p>

  <p>"Everything. Hallam, he is Soyoka!"</p>

  <p>Hallam looked at him open-mouthed. "You're mad&mdash;Soyoka?"</p>

  <p>"He's either Soyoka or he's somewhere high up in the gang. Why shouldn't
  he be? The profit of Amery's isn't eight thousand a year. We know what profit
  there is in Soyoka's&mdash;they'remaking millions whilst we'remaking
  thousands. He's been living in India, not guessing that old Amery would leave
  him this business. We've always known that Indian officials were hand in
  glove with Soyoka's gang. Otherwise, how would he have known where to look in
  the books for the consignments we've had? The first thing he did was to put
  his finger on a case of fancy goods we had from Stein of Leipsic and ask for
  particulars. He told me to get, and I'm getting. Hallam, it's death to fight
  Soyoka! They'll stop at nothing. I can't stand any more, Hallam. I am too old
  for this kind of business."</p>

  <p>"Not too old to marry, they tell me."</p>

  <p>Tarn looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Just what I say. I understand that you contemplate making a get-away with
  a lady, who shall be nameless."</p>

  <p>Maurice Tarn shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm scared."</p>

  <p>"Scared you may be." There was nothing pleasant in Ralph Hallam's voice;
  his face had hardened, the underlip pouted ominously. "And if you feel like
  getting away, why, you can go. You've enough money to get your nerves in
  order. South America, of course? I thought so. Go and be blessed! You've lost
  your nerve and so far as I am concerned you're valueless. You're worse than
  that&mdash;you're a danger. We'll have a quick division and then you can
  go&mdash;to the devil if you like."</p>

  <p>Slowly he crossed to the broken man and stood looking down at him.</p>

  <p>"But you go alone. I want a partner."</p>

  <p>"Elsa?" gasped the other.</p>

  <p>"Elsa," said Ralph Hallam. "I can talk her into my way of thinking. That
  will be easy. I want her, Maurice. She is altogether adorable. I don't blame
  you for wanting her. She is divine! But I want her too. There is a world of
  happiness in that slim lady, Maurice!"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" Tarn was looking at him, horror-stricken. Some
  solitary cell in his brain, where decency had once dwelt, was operating
  powerfully&mdash;"but you can't, Ralph! You're married&mdash;know that you're
  married. You can't marry Elsal."</p>

  <p>"I said nothing about marriage," said Ralph Hallam testily. "For God's
  sake don't be so respectable!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap05"
     id="chap05">V. THE MAN IN THE ROOM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the drive back to the office Elsa was in a quieter frame
  of mind and could think clearly. She had not told Hallam everything: he knew
  nothing (she thought) of her nightly ordeal, when, his study table littered
  with the bottles he had emptied, Maurice Tarn had talked and talked until her
  head reeled. She used to think his oblique references to matrimony, its
  advantages and compensations, were efforts of sheer loquacity. She understood
  now. Muddled and bemused, he was trying to prepare her for his monstrous
  proposal. Something was wrong&mdash;badly wrong. He did not drink so heavily
  in the old days. She checked a sigh as the cab turned into Wood Street, and
  she tapped at the window to stop the machine before it reached the door of
  Amery's.</p>

  <p>It was half-past two when she hurried up the narrow stairs, hoping that
  her unpleasant employer had not rung for her. As she opened the door of her
  room she saw a man sitting on a chair by the window. Though it was a warm
  day, he wore an overcoat, over the collar of which his black hair flowed. His
  back was toward her, for he seemed absorbed in his contemplation of the
  street below, and not until he heard the click of the closing door did he
  turn round suddenly and stand up. For a moment Elsa stared at him
  open-mouthed. It was a Chinaman!</p>

  <p>He was dressed in the height of fashion. His smartly-cut overcoat was
  wasp-waisted, his striped grey trousers were rigidly creased, and over his
  enamelled boots were a pair of white spats. The fashionable cravat, the neat
  gloves, all these things were European. But the face! The fathomless black
  eyes, set behind lashless lids, the yellow face like wrinkled parchment, the
  bloodless lips, the protruding underjaw&mdash;she had never seen anything
  quite so hideous; and, as though he read her thoughts, he said, in perfect
  English:</p>

  <p>"Handsome is as handsome does&mdash;Feng Ho, Bachelor of Science&mdash;my
  card!"</p>

  <p>And with a little bow, he handed her an oblong of pasteboard, which she
  took mechanically.</p>

  <p>At that moment she became aware of a strange and lovely sound. It was the
  glorious note of a bird in song. Perched on a shelf was a cage of exquisite
  workmanship. Gold wire and coloured glass combined to make the palace of the
  little songster a thing of rare beauty. Standing on the perch was a
  lemon-yellow canary, his thick throat throbbing in the song of his kind.</p>

  <p>"How wonderful!" she breathed. "Where did it come from?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ho grinned.</p>

  <p>"I brought him here. Pi always accompanies me. In the street many people
  look round, thinking it remarkable that a Chinese gentleman, a bachelor of
  science, should carry a common bird-cage in his hand. But Pi needs the air.
  It is not good for a little bird to live all the time in rooms. Pi, unworthy
  and ugly little crow, sing your stupid song for the beautiful lady."</p>

  <p>The bird had been momentarily silent, but now he burst again into a flood
  of melody that filled the drab room with golden sound.</p>

  <p>"He is wonderful!" said Elsa again, and looked from the bird to his
  owner.</p>

  <p>The inscrutable eyes of the Chinaman were watching her. "I am afraid I
  gave you rather a shock," he said, in his queer, mincing way. "You are
  probably not used to meeting Chinamen, Miss Marlowe."</p>

  <p>She gasped. How did this creature know her name? "You&mdash;you want to
  see Major Amery?' she said, recovering her equilibrium.</p>

  <p>"I have seen him. He asked me to wait a little while and to introduce
  myself when you came. I am afraid I shall be a frequent visitor."</p>

  <p>She forced herself to smile.</p>

  <p>"You need not be afraid of that, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Should she call him "Mr. Feng" or "Mr. Ho"? Again he must have read her
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ho is a compound name," he said, "and the 'Mr.' is unnecessary,
  unless you would feel more comfortable in the employment of that prefix."</p>

  <p>He was looking complacently at his brand-new gloves as he spoke, and
  then:</p>

  <p>"Major Amery has just come in."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him quickly.</p>

  <p>"I didn't hear him," she said.</p>

  <p>He nodded rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is now walking across the room; he has stopped by the fireplace."
  He held his head erect in an attitude of listening. "Now he is at his desk
  and he has picked up a paper. Did you not hear the rustle?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him suspiciously. Was this wretched man, who had so easily
  assumed terms of equality, being amusing at her expense?</p>

  <p>"I hear everything," he said. "Now he is sitting in his chair&mdash;it
  creaked."</p>

  <p>She walked to the door of the Major's room and opened it.</p>

  <p>He was sitting at his desk; his hand was out-stretched to touch the bell
  that summoned her when she looked in.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he said brusquely. "You've met Feng Ho?"</p>

  <p>He saw her flushed cheeks, and his lip lifted in that hateful smile of
  his.</p>

  <p>"He has been giving you a demonstration of his hearing? That is his one
  vanity."</p>

  <p>He looked round at the Chinaman. Feng Ho displayed the immense cavity of
  his mouth in a grin that stretched from ear to ear.</p>

  <p>"Close the door, please," he said, and then, as she was about to obey,
  shutting the Chinaman out, a string of unintelligible words came from his
  lips and she saw Feng Ho hide his hands in his sleeves and bow.</p>

  <p>"You may see a great deal of Feng Ho. On the other hand, you may not. Take
  this letter."</p>

  <p>For the next quarter of an hour her fingers were flying over the pages of
  her notebook, for when Amery dictated, he spoke at a speed that tried her
  ability to the limit. His words came like the staccato rattle of a
  machine-gun, and the sentence ended as abruptly. She looked up, expecting to
  be dismissed, and found him looking at her.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ho is Chinese," he said unnecessarily, and added, with a look of
  annoyance when he saw her smile: "So many people mistake the Chinese for a
  neighbouring nation." He paused, and then went on slowly: "Soyoka, on the
  other hand, is a Jap. And Soyoka is a very good paymaster."</p>

  <p>The name seemed familiar to her, but for the moment she could not remember
  where she had seen or heard it.</p>

  <p>"A very excellent paymaster," he went on. "I think you might do better if
  you served him instead of this amateur crowd. Soyoka pays well."</p>

  <p>His eyes did not leave her face, and he saw that she was still
  puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to leave you&mdash;Amery's?" she asked. "Who is Soyoka? I
  seem to have heard the name."</p>

  <p>"Soyoka is a Japanese&mdash;gentleman," he said, a hint of primness in his
  tone, "and a very powerful Japanese gentleman and a very rich Japanese
  gentleman. There are no"&mdash;he paused&mdash;"flies on Soyoka. And his
  friends are always willing to enlist the services of people who are likely to
  be of help. Soyoka would not object to engaging one who had been working for
  his competitors; in fact, he would welcome the opportunity. And, as I say, he
  is a very excellent paymaster."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You bewilder me, Major Amery. I really don't know who Soyoka is, and I
  don't think I should care to work for&mdash;Eastern people."</p>

  <p>He made no reply. Then:</p>

  <p>"You can trust Feng Ho," he said unexpectedly. "He has all the virtues and
  none of the vices of the East. Most Chinamen are amiable souls with a passion
  for song-birds. If Feng Ho ever walks into this office&mdash;however, you may
  like Feng Ho. He improves upon acquaintance. A river pirate killed his
  father," he went on in his inconsequent way. "Feng Ho followed him into the
  mountains of Ningpo and brought back seven pirates' heads in a Gladstone bag.
  A queer fellow."</p>

  <p>She was speechless with horror and amazement.</p>

  <p>"That&mdash;that little man?" she said incredulously. "How dreadful!"</p>

  <p>"It's rather dreadful to have your father's throat cut," said the strange
  man coldly. And then, again going off at a tangent:</p>

  <p>"Feng Ho is death to Soyoka's rivals&mdash;remember that."</p>

  <p>"Who is Soyoka?" she asked, a little exasperated. "You've made three
  references to him, Major Amery, and I may be dull, but I really can't see
  their application."</p>

  <p>He did not reply: that was his most maddening and most offensive
  trick.</p>

  <p>"What do you do with yourself on Sundays?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>For answer she rose and gathered up her notes.</p>

  <p>"You will want these letters before the afternoon post, Major Amery," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"You haven't answered me."</p>

  <p>"I don't think that is a matter which really concerns you, does it?" she
  said with a touch of hauteur which she felt was absurd.</p>

  <p>His fingers were beating a rapid tattoo upon his blotting-pad. "The
  private lives of my employees are a matter of considerable interest to me,"
  he said. "But perhaps it isn't the practice in this country to be too closely
  concerned. Only it struck me that your cottage was rather isolated, and very
  near the river; and there should be bars on the window of your room. It is
  rather too close to the ground, and any active man could jump up to the
  portico and be in your room before you could say 'knife'."</p>

  <p>Elsa sat down suddenly. How did this man know of Maurice Tarn's little
  week-end cottage on the upper reaches of the Thames? And yet he not only
  knew, but had examined the place so care fully that he had located the room
  in which she slept on her weekend visits; had even made calculations about
  the height of the window&mdash;it was unbelievable.</p>

  <p>"I really don't understand you, Major Amery. There is something behind all
  these questions, and frankly, I am not very easy in my mind about&mdash;about
  things."</p>

  <p>She hated herself for this failing of hers: there was always a lame end to
  her sentences when she was speaking to this man. And then to her amazement,
  he laughed. She had never seen him laugh before, and she gazed, fascinated.
  His whole aspect was changed, and for a second he was human; but as suddenly
  as he had begun, he stopped, and his face was frozen again to a graven
  inexpressiveness.</p>

  <p>"You must ask Feng Ho for one of his canaries; he has several. But unless
  you promise to take the little bird for a walk every evening, as the
  Britisher takes his dog, he will not give you one. Thank you, that will
  do."</p>

  <p>Elsa came out of the office, her face flushed, her mind disordered,
  hesitating between anger and amusement. Feng Ho had gone. She wished he had
  left the canary behind; she needed some antidote to the sinister man.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap06"
     id="chap06">VI. MRS. TRENE HALLAM'S CONSIDERATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FEW people who visited Mrs. Trene Hallam's expensively
  furnished flat in Herbert Mansions associated her name with that of the
  prosperous young doctor of Hall Moon Street; and those who, by coincidence,
  were acquainted with both, never for one moment dreamt that this pretty,
  golden-haired woman, with her pale blue eyes and fight, hard mouth, was in
  any way related to that very popular and pleasant man.</p>

  <p>For a consideration Mrs. Hallam lived apart from her husband and claimed
  no relationship. She bred Pekinese dogs, was a member of two bridge clubs,
  and apparently was a lady of independent means. It was not likely that people
  would think of Dr. Hallam in her connection, for she was a daughter of the
  people, whose lack of education and refinement was sometimes only too
  painfully apparent.</p>

  <p>She had married Ralph Hallam with the object of getting away from the tiny
  villa where he had lodged with her mother during the days when he was a
  student at St. Thomas's. The marriage had not been a happy one. Louise
  Hallam, to other failings, added a somewhat erratic conception of common
  honesty. She was a born pilferer, and not even her changed circumstances
  eradicated the habit. Twice Ralph Hallam had to pay heavily to avoid a
  scandal. Once this kleptomaniac had narrowly escaped arrest. Thereafter they
  had lived apart, and for the "consideration" she now enjoyed, she was quite
  willing to remain in her present state for the rest of her life.</p>

  <p>He was the rarest of visitors at Herbert Mansions, and the surprise she
  displayed when he was shown into the drawing-room where she was taking her
  rest, with a cup of coffee by her side and a cigarette between her lips, was
  not wholly assumed.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, stranger!" she said genially. "This is a sight for sore eyes.
  What's up?"</p>

  <p>His expression was one of pain.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd get out of that gutter habit," he said wearily.</p>

  <p>She was eyeing him keenly and unresentfully. The taunt of her humble
  origin had not aroused her anger in years.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" she asked bluntly. "A divorce?"</p>

  <p>He took out a cigarette and lit it before he answered.</p>

  <p>"No. Thank God I've recovered from that folly! When I think of the fools I
  should have married if I'd divorced you when I wanted, I am grateful to you.
  You're my safety, Lou. Never divorce me!"</p>

  <p>"You needn't fret," she said complacently; "I shan't. If I wanted to marry
  again it would be different, but I don't. One marriage is enough for little
  me! Ralph, what are you doing nowadays?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;what am I doing?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"You're making money. I'm not complaining about that; but you're making
  big money, and I'm wondering how? You've increased my allowance, bless you!
  And when I asked you to buy me that little place in the country, you bought
  it without a kick. You're not doing that out of momma's money. What is the
  dope?"</p>

  <p>He started and looked at her suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know what you mean by that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She struggled to a sitting position, laughing.</p>

  <p>"You're getting touchy, Ralph! What I meant was, how are you getting it? I
  can't imagine you committing a burglary, though I've always known there was
  nothing crooked you wouldn't do. It must be a safe swindle, because you don't
  look a day older than when I left a good home to marry you. Worry ages."</p>

  <p>"Never you mind how I get my money," he said shortly. "I want you to do
  something to earn yours. I've made life pretty agreeable to you, haven't I,
  Lou?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders, and the tight mouth became a straight red
  line.</p>

  <p>"I mistrust you when you start in to tell me all the things you've done
  for me," she said truthfully. "At the same time, I'll admit that you've never
  stinted me of money. What is the hook to this bit of bait?"</p>

  <p>"You're a suspicious woman!" he said. "All I want from you is information.
  A few years ago you wanted to see the world and I sent you to India."</p>

  <p>She nodded, watching him.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"You had a chance of meeting the very best people in India, and apparently
  you did. You came back with more jewellery than you took out&mdash;a diamond
  sunburst was one thing." She did not meet his eyes. "A rajah gave it to
  you&mdash;you were there a year. Did you ever meet a Major Paul Amery?"</p>

  <p>She knit her brows.</p>

  <p>"Amery? Why, yes, I think I met him. One of those reserved people who
  never speak, and you get an idea they'rethinking a whole lot, until you know
  them better, and then you discover that they'reworrying about their
  overdraft. Paul Amery? Why, of course! He was rather nice to me, now I come
  to think of it. Attached to the political service, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"That I don't know," said Ralph; "but if he was 'rather nice' to you, and
  you're friendly with him, I'd like you to improve his acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"Is he in London?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"What do you want? Are you stringing him?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not stringing him," said the other with elaborate patience, "if by
  'stringing' you mean&mdash;" he paused for a simile.</p>

  <p>"Kidding," suggested his wife, lighting one cigarette from the glowing end
  of another. "I'm out of practice with that work, though I'll do anything to
  oblige a loving husband. Which reminds me, Ralph, that my car has reached the
  museum stage. That Boyson woman has got a cute little Rolls, one of the new
  kind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We'll talk about that later," said her husband, with a touch of
  irritability. "The point is, will you go along and see this fellow? I have an
  idea he's engaged in a&mdash;er&mdash;unpleasant business. At any rate, I
  want you to get acquainted with him&mdash;that's one thing."</p>

  <p>"And the other?" Mrs. Hallam's eyes narrowed. "In my experience of you,
  Ralphie, it's 'the other thing' that's most important. You always make a fuss
  about the least important job, and pass the other over careless-like. What is
  it?"</p>

  <p>Ralph rose with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing really. Only Tarn's niece is having a little trouble with
  him, Tarn is the City man I've told you about. The old fool wants to marry
  her, and I think it would be rather doing the girl a service to get her away
  for a day or two. I want you to invite her to come and stay with
  you&mdash;you can be my sister-in-law for the occasion."</p>

  <p>"Pretty?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet she is. And she thinks you're the wonderful boy&mdash;handsome
  Alec. And when she comes here, what happens? Do I go out when you visit? Or
  am I called away into the country, like I was when that girl from the
  Stores&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Keep your damned mouth shut about that girl from the Stores." There was
  an ugly look on his face. "You get a little too fresh sometimes, Lou. I don't
  keep you to amuse me. There are four good theatres in town that I can go to
  when I want to laugh."</p>

  <p>She waved him down.</p>

  <p>"Don't lose your temper: tempers worry little sister! Write down her name
  and address. Have you spoken about me?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yours to command," she said lazily. "Now what's the consideration,
  Ralph?"</p>

  <p>"You can have your new car," he growled. "But I'm serious about Amery: it
  is necessary that you should see him. You can't miss the place; it's in Wood
  Street&mdash;the Amery building. And you'll see the girl: she's working in
  the office&mdash;her name is Elsa Marlowe. You can't very well mistake her
  either&mdash;she's a peach! And be careful with Amery: he's sharp!"</p>

  <p>She smiled contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"I've got a new gown from Poiret's that would take the edge off a razor,"
  she said. "When do you want me to go?"</p>

  <p>"To-day. You can speak to the girl; tell her you're my sister-in-
  law."</p>

  <p>"And a widow. My departed husband will have to have been dead for a year
  or so, for that gown of mine is slightly on the joyous side."</p>

  <p>She made no further reference to the girl, her future or her fate. That
  was not the kind of "consideration" that ever troubled Mrs. Trene Hallam.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap07"
     id="chap07">VII. AN INDIAN ACQUAINTANCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a tap at the door, and, without moving her eyes
  from the notebook from which she was typing, Elsa said:</p>

  <p>"Come in."</p>

  <p>The faintest whiff of an exotic scent made her look round in surprise. The
  lady who stood in the doorway was a stranger to her. Elsa thought she was
  pretty in her thin and dainty way The dress, she saw with an appraising
  woman's eye, was lovely.</p>

  <p>"Is this Major Amery's office?"</p>

  <p>The voice was not so pleasing; there was just the faintest hint of
  commonness. But she had no time to form an impression before, with a sweet
  smile, the woman came forward, her gloved hand extended.</p>

  <p>"Isn't this Elsa Marlowe? she asked.</p>

  <p>"That is my name," said Elsa, wondering who this unknown might be.</p>

  <p>"I am Louise Hallam&mdash;Mrs. Trene Hallam. Ralph told me about you."</p>

  <p>A light dawned upon Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, of course, you're Ralph's sister-in-law?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I married his dear brother&mdash;such a sweet man," murmured
  Mrs. Hallam. "But much too good for this world!" She sighed and touched her
  eyes daintily with a little handkerchief, providentially at hand. "The good
  die young," she said. "He was thirty. A few years younger than Ralph, but oh!
  such a sweet man! What a dear little office!" She beamed round approvingly,
  raising unnecessary gold lorgnons to survey the uninspiring scene. "And how
  do you get on with Major Amery? I always thought he was such a perfectly
  lovely man when I met him in India. My dear husband took me there for a
  holiday."</p>

  <p>She sighed again, but this time perhaps with a little more sincerity, for
  India held memories which were at once dear and dour.</p>

  <p>"You know Major Amery?" said the girl eagerly. "What sort of a man is
  he&mdash;to meet, I mean?" and grew hot as she realized that her eagerness
  might be misunderstood.</p>

  <p>"A sweet creature," said Mrs. Hallam, and the description was so
  incongruous that Elsa could have laughed.</p>

  <p>"I've called to see him, and I was killing two birds with one stone," Mrs.
  Hallam went on, and, with a roguish little smile and uplifted finger: "I know
  a little girl who is coming to stay with me for a whole week!"</p>

  <p>Elsa flushed, and for some reason which she could not fathom,
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether it will be possible, Mrs. Hallam&mdash;" she
  began.</p>

  <p>"It must be possible&mdash;I'm going to give you a really nice time. It
  was very stupid of Ralph not to tell me that he had such a charming friend. I
  would have asked you over before. We'll do some theatres and concerts
  together, though concerts certainly bore me stiff&mdash;I mean, they bore me"
  she corrected herself hastily. "I will not take 'no' for an answer. When can
  you come?"</p>

  <p>Elsa thought rapidly.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>She could not understand her own reluctance to accept an invitation which
  sounded so enticing.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow I shall expect you."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hallam took a card from her jewelled case and laid it on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"You shall have the dearest little room of your own. I'm all alone, and
  you won't be bothered with servants; it is a service flat. If you want
  anything, you just ring for it. I think you'll be very happy."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure that my uncle can spare me," said Elsa, more loth to go
  than ever, now that she had practically accepted.</p>

  <p>"Your uncle <i>must</i> spare you. And now I must see dear Major Amery.
  Would you tell him I am here?"</p>

  <p>Elsa tapped at the door and her employer's sharp voice answered her.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Trene Hallam to see you, Major Amery," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>He stared up from his writing.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Trene Hallam to see me. Now, isn't that nice of her? Shoot her
  in!"</p>

  <p>Elsa opened the door for the woman and closed it behind her, as Major
  Amery rose slowly to greet the visitor who sailed across the room.</p>

  <p>"You don't remember me, Major Amery?" she said, with a hint of coquetry in
  her pale blue eyes; a smile at once pleased and reproachful.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I remember you very well, Mrs. Hallam. Won't you sit down?"</p>

  <p>"It was in Poona, I think," said Mrs. Hallam when she had settled herself.
  "Do you remember that delightful ball the Governor gave? Those glorious roses
  everywhere. Don't you remember what a terribly hot night it was, and how they
  had great blocks of ice on the stairways?"</p>

  <p>"Are you sending back Lady Mortel's diamond brooch?"</p>

  <p>At the sound of that metallic voice the smile left the woman's face and
  she sat up.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;don't know what you mean," she faltered "I&mdash;I really don't
  understand you."</p>

  <p>"Whilst you were the guest of Lady Mortel, a diamond sunburst was missed.
  A servant was arrested and tried for the theft&mdash;he went to prison for
  three years. The other night I saw you at the theatre&mdash;I saw the brooch
  too."</p>

  <p>She went red and white.</p>

  <p>"I really do not understand you, Captain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Major," he said laconically. "I have been promoted since. Hallam sent you
  here, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Hallam? My husband is dead&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's news to me," he broke in. "He was alive when he left your flat at
  Herbert Mansions this afternoon. Street accident?"</p>

  <p>"I think you're very horrid," she whimpered. She was no longer the urbane
  woman of the world. Under his merciless glance she seemed to cringe and
  shrink. It was as though the meanness of her had worn through the veneer that
  modiste and milliner had overlaid upon the hard and ugly substance of her
  soul.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were a friend of mine I would never have called on you if
  I'd known you could be so horrid..."</p>

  <p>"I'm not being horrid, I'm being truthful, though I admit that truth is
  pretty beastly," he said. "Why did you come here?"</p>

  <p>"To call on you," she said. "Just to renew... to meet you again... I
  didn't expect..."</p>

  <p>Again he checked her.</p>

  <p>"Tell Hallam from me to find a new occupation. Tell him I am after his
  blood, and I mean it! I want that amateur dope-running corporation out of my
  way."</p>

  <p>"Dope-running?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"You didn't know? I wondered if he had told you. My last word to him
  is&mdash;git! You'll remember that?"</p>

  <p>He had not resumed his seat, and now, leaning across the table, he jerked
  out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Mrs. Trene Hallam. Trene is your maiden name, if I remember
  rightly? Your mother lived in Tenison Street, Lambeth. Don't forget the
  message I have given you for your husband."</p>

  <p>It needed all her artistry to compose her face into a smile as she passed
  into the outer office, pulling the door behind her.</p>

  <p>"Such a dear, sweet man, but a little changed," she murmured, and took the
  girl's hand in hers for a second. "You will remember, my dear?"</p>

  <p>"I will try to come, but if I can't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You must come," said Louise Hallam, and there was a sharp quality in her
  voice. "I will not take 'no'."</p>

  <p>She seemed in a hurry to leave, did not linger for another second; and all
  the way home she was wondering whether Major Amery and his secretary were on
  sufficiently good terms for him to take her into his confidence.</p>

  <p>She had hardly left the room before Amery turned quickly and opened a door
  that led to a tiny room, which served as a clothes press and wash-place. Its
  solitary occupant, who was sitting on an old trunk, rose as the door opened,
  and came out into the office. The major held Mrs. Hallam's card between his
  two fingers.</p>

  <p>"Go to this address some time to-night. Search the flat thoroughly. I want
  every document that you can find."</p>

  <p>He spoke in the sibilant dialect of Canton, and Feng Ho was sufficiently
  Europeanized to nod.</p>

  <p>"You must use no force, unless it is absolutely necessary. You may find
  nothing. On the other hand, you may get some valuable information. If
  necessary, you may be able to use the name of Soyoka to advantage. Go!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap08"
     id="chap08">VIII. THE EXPLOIT OF FENG HO</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ELGIN CRESCENT was singularly unattractive to Elsa that
  night. She came by 'bus from the City to Trafalgar Square and walked the
  remainder of the way through the three parks. The crocuses were blooming; the
  trees were shooting out emerald-green buds; the early bushes were in full
  leaf; here and there she saw the beginning of rhododendron flowers, hard
  little sticky masses of an indescribable colour that would presently set the
  park aflame. But wherever her eyes roamed, her mind was completely absorbed,
  even to the exclusion of Maurice Tarn and his amazing proposal, in the
  strange man who had suddenly come into her workaday life. She did not even
  resent the companionship of the voluble Miss Dame, who, against her will, had
  insisted upon coming home with her. Miss Dame lived at Notting Hill Gate, and
  her company could hardly be refused.</p>

  <p>The speech might have been all on one side but for the fact that Jessie
  Dame chose for her discourse the subject of Elsa's thoughts.</p>

  <p>"What I hate about him," said Miss Dame, with typical energy, "is his
  slinkiness. Have you ever noticed, Miss Marlowe, how he slinks around,
  wearing sneakers too?"</p>

  <p>"Sneakers? Oh, you mean his rubber shoes?"</p>

  <p>"Sneakers is the word for them, and a very good word," said Miss Dame.
  "He's like that fellow in 'The Horrible Night.' You know the one I
  mean&mdash;Ethel Gilbey was in it. You remember when those mysterious hands
  came out of doors and the lights went out? And then another hand came up and
  caught her by the throat. Oh, it was perfectly marvellous. Well, that's him,"
  she added incoherently.</p>

  <p>And yet, thought Elsa, the sinister man did not "slink." He was furtive,
  but not meanly furtive. You could not imagine a mean leopard or a mean lion
  stalking his prey... The thought startled her. Was that the reason for his
  queer secretiveness? Was he stalking somebody? She dismissed the possibility
  with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm getting romantic," she said.</p>

  <p>"You are romantic," said Miss Dame decisively. "I've always said that
  you're wasted in an office; you ought to be on the pictures. You're
  svelte&mdash;that's the word, svelte. I believe in a woman showing her figure
  if she's got any to show."</p>

  <p>"Do I show my figure?" asked the alarmed Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Of course you do," said Miss Dame derisively. "And why shouldn't you?
  What's a figure for? You'd be perfectly marvellous on the screen. I thought
  of going in for it myself, but only as a comic," she said with a sigh. "I'm
  not svelte enough."</p>

  <p>Out of the corner of her eye Elsa caught a glimpse of the ungainly figure
  and agreed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tarn had not returned when she got to the maisonette. They kept no
  servants; two daily helps came in, in the morning and in the evening, and
  from one of them she learnt that he had telephoned to say that he would not
  be home until late, and that she was not to wait dinner for him. For this she
  was grateful, for she was not inclined to resume the conversation of the
  morning.</p>

  <p>No. 409, Elgin Crescent, consisted of two maisonettes, a lower, comprising
  the ground floor and basement, and an upper, which her guardian occupied,
  comprising the remainder of the house. The study and dining-room were on the
  first floor; she had the back room on the second floor, above the
  dining-room, or a bed-sitting-room; and to this safe harbour she retreated
  just as soon as she had finished her dinner.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant little apartment, with a writing-table, a dozen
  well-filled bookshelves, a cosy chair that she could draw up before the gas
  fire, and a tiny wireless set which had filled so many long and dreary winter
  evenings with amusement.</p>

  <p>She tried to read, but between her eyes and the printed page came the face
  of the sinister man, and the lifted lips sneered up at her so vividly and so
  insistently that presently she closed the book with a crash. She wondered
  what a man like he did in the evenings. He had a club perhaps. She remembered
  Ralph had told her he had seen him there. Perhaps he went to theatres. What
  sort of plays would arouse him from his ingrained cynicism? Had he any
  relations or friends? In a way she felt a little sorry for him, just as the
  sight of a prison would arouse sorrow and tenderness for its undeserving
  occupants.</p>

  <p>She fitted the headphones and heard part of "Aida" relayed from the Open
  House, and found herself speculating as to whether he would be in the
  audience. At this evidence of imbecility she viciously tugged off the
  headphones and prepared for bed. She was undressing when she heard the
  blundering steps of Mr. Tarn on the stairs, and the bang of his study door as
  he closed it. At any rate, he could not bother her that night. She said her
  prayers, turned out the light and jumped into bed, and in a few minutes fell
  into the sweet, sound sleep which is youth's greatest but least appreciated
  blessing.</p>

  <p>She was not a heavy sleeper, but, if she had been, the sound would have
  awakened her. The room was in complete darkness. She could hear the ticking
  of the clock on the mantelshelf, and, for the rest, silence reigned in the
  house.</p>

  <p>What was it? She sat up, trying to recall the noise that had awakened her.
  It came again, but this time it could not have been so loud&mdash;a faint,
  snapping sound, which came from the window.</p>

  <p>Slipping out of bed, she pulled aside the curtains. The fading moon still
  bathed the world in its eerie radiance, and reflected evilly from a
  glittering something that lay on the window-sill.</p>

  <p>She threw up the window and, with a cry of astonishment, took the thing in
  her hand. It was a dagger, and the handle was inscribed in Chinese
  characters!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap09"
     id="chap09">IX. "MAYFAIR 10016"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A KNIFE! Who left it there? She had to remove the wedge
  which kept the upper sash of her window in place, before she could lift the
  lower and look out. For a second she saw nothing, and then...</p>

  <p>A builder's long ladder had been reared against the wall, and the
  explanation of the midnight visit was now clear. The top of the ladder
  reached within two feet of her window, and as she looked she saw a dark
  figure slide down to the ground, pause for a moment and look up before it
  vanished in the shadow of the big tree. In that space of time she saw the
  face distinctly&mdash;it was Feng Ho.</p>

  <p>What should she do?</p>

  <p>"I ought to scream, I suppose," she said to herself, but never felt less
  like screaming although she had had a bad scare.</p>

  <p>She turned on the light and looked at the clock. It was half-past three.
  Mr. Tarn would be in bed, and he was the last person she wanted to arouse.
  Pulling on her dressing-gown and slippers, she went out of the mom and down
  the dark stairs to the dining-room, the windows of which were shuttered and
  barred. Here she made herself tea with an electric kettle, and sat down to
  consider what she should do next.</p>

  <p>Feng Ho! She frowned at the thought. "You will see a great deal of Feng
  Ho," Amery had said, and her lips twisted in a smile. At any rate, she did
  not wish to see a great deal of Feng Ho in circumstances similar to those in
  which he had made his appearance that morning.</p>

  <p>And then came to her a wild and fantastic idea. It was the sight of the
  telephone on the sideboard that gave it to her. Major Amery occupied his
  uncle's house in Brook Street.</p>

  <p>She put the thought from her, only to turn to it again. Presently she went
  in search of the telephone directory and found it in her uncle's study. The
  place reeked with the smell of brandy, and for a moment she felt physically
  sick, and hurried out with the thick volume under her arm.</p>

  <p>Yes, there it was&mdash;"Amery, Major P., 97b, Brook Street. Mayfair
  10016." He would be in bed and asleep. The prospect of rousing him filled her
  with malicious joy, and she lifted the hook and waited. It was a long time
  before the operator answered, but within a few seconds of his answering her
  signal, she heard a click and a sharp voice demanded:</p>

  <p>"Who is that?"</p>

  <p>Elsa's lips twitched.</p>

  <p>"Is that Major Amery?" she asked sweetly.</p>

  <p>"Yes. What do you want, Miss Marlowe?"</p>

  <p>He had recognised her voice! The discovery took her breath away, and for a
  moment she was unable to proceed.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;we've just had a visit from a friend of yours," she said, a
  little wildly. "A least he didn't come in!"</p>

  <p>"A friend of mine? You mean Feng Ho?"</p>

  <p>His coolness was staggering.</p>

  <p>"Of course I mean Feng Ho. He was trying to get in through the window of
  my room," she said, her anger rising.</p>

  <p>"Your room?" came the quick response. "You mean your bedroom?"</p>

  <p>"That is the only room I have," she added, and there was a silence at the
  other end of the 'phone.</p>

  <p>After a while he spoke.</p>

  <p>"You must have been mistaken. It could not have been Feng Ho," said his
  voice. "He is with me now. One Chinaman looks very much like another to the
  uninitiated eye. I'm sorry you have been frightened."</p>

  <p>The last words came in a different tone. He had explained her error
  hurriedly, which was not like him. She knew it was useless to argue the
  matter on the telephone.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I got you out of bed," she said.</p>

  <p>"Are you scared?"</p>

  <p>Was she mistaken in imagining an undercurrent of anxiety and concern in
  his voice?</p>

  <p>"No, I was startled." Another silence. "Does Mr. Tarn know?"</p>

  <p>"No, he is asleep; I haven't awakened him, unless I'm waking him now. I'm
  sorry I bothered you. Goodnight."</p>

  <p>"Wait," he said sharply. "You are sure you're not frightened?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm not frightened, Major Amery. You're forever thinking that
  I'm frightened," she said with a smile, remembering the conversation of the
  morning.</p>

  <p>Was it a quiet laugh she heard? Apparently not, for there was no laughter
  in his voice when he said, with his customary brusqueness:</p>

  <p>"Good-night. Go back to bed."</p>

  <p>How like him to finish that strange conversation with a peremptory order,
  she thought, as she hung up the telephone. At that moment Maurice Tarn, with
  an old dressing gown huddled about him, came blinking into the light.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" he asked harshly. "What are you doing here, telephoning at
  this hour of the morning? Whom were you talking to?"</p>

  <p>"I was talking to Major Amery."</p>

  <p>"Amery!" he squeaked. "Major Amery? What were you telling him?"</p>

  <p>He was terrified, and in his agitation gripped her wrist with such force
  that she cried out.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he muttered. "What is it all about, Elsa?"</p>

  <p>"I was merely telling Major Amery that I caught a friend of his to-night,
  trying to get in through my window."</p>

  <p>For a moment he could not grasp her meaning.</p>

  <p>"Who was it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. A Chinaman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A Chinaman!" he screamed. "A friend of Amery's trying to get in!"</p>

  <p>In as few words as possible she told him all she had seen, and he
  listened, his teeth chattering.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" he said, his hand on his brow. "A Chinaman! He had a knife,
  had he? You're sure about the knife?"</p>

  <p>"He may have only been using it to open the window," said the girl,
  astounded at the extraordinary effect which the news had upon her relative.
  She had never seen a man in such an abject condition of fear. By the time she
  had finished his pallid face was streaming with perspiration.</p>

  <p>"You 'phoned Amery?" huskily. "What did he say?"</p>

  <p>"That it wasn't Feng Ho."</p>

  <p>"He's a liar! It was the Chinaman who came into the office to-day... I
  just saw him... Feng Ho! Elsa, that's my finish! They'll be watching for me
  now&mdash;every port..."</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, Mr. Tarn?" she asked, frightened in spite of herself
  by the terror of the man. "Have you done something&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk, don't talk." He waved her to silence. "I don't want to
  discuss it, I tell you. I was expecting this." He waved his hand into the
  pocket of his tattered dressing-gown and drew out a long-barrelled revolver.
  "But they'll not catch me, Elsa, by God!"</p>

  <p>The hand that held the pistol shook so violently that she was in some fear
  that it would explode by accident, and was relieved when he put it back into
  his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Paul Amery, curse him! I could tell you something about Amery... not now,
  not now.. I'm going into my study."</p>

  <p>He rushed out, and she heard the key turn in the lock, and then, through
  the thin partition which separated the dining-room from the study, there came
  the clink of glass against glass. Mr. Tarn was fortifying himself against the
  terrors which the remaining hours of darkness might hold.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">X. MR. TARN MAKES A WILL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. TARN was not at breakfast the next morning; she would
  have been surprised if he had been. His door was still locked, and only after
  repeated hammerings did his sleepy voice growl an intimation that he would be
  out in a few minutes. Elsa hurried her breakfast and was successful in
  leaving the house before Tarn made an appearance.</p>

  <p>She was anxious to get to the office, and curious as to what explanation
  Amery would offer. She might have guessed that he would offer none. When, at
  half-past nine, his bell summoned, her, she went to a man who certainly bore
  no appearance of having spent the night out of bed. He met her with his
  characteristic lack of greeting, and plunged straight away into his letters,
  firing across the table magazine after magazine of words, to be caught and
  recorded. It was not until she was leaving that he made any reference to
  their conversation of the early morning.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you call me up in the night? I have a dim recollection of the
  circumstances."</p>

  <p>"I had almost forgotten," she said coolly, and his face twitched.</p>

  <p>"Possibly you were dreaming," he said. "But it is a dream which will never
  come true&mdash;again. When Feng Ho comes, ask him to tell you the story of
  his finger."</p>

  <p>"His finger?" she repeated, surprised in spite of herself.</p>

  <p>"His little finger. You broke yours at school, playing hockey. Ask him how
  he lost his."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know he'd lost a finger."</p>

  <p>"Ask him," he said, and his head jerked to the door.</p>

  <p>She wished he would find another way of telling her that she could go.</p>

  <p>It was nearly lunch time when Feng Ho came, as dapper as ever, his coat
  spotless, his trousers even more rigidly creased, his white spats exchanged
  for articles of bright yellow leather; his umbrella and his hat were in one
  hand, and in the other the gilded cage with a dignified canary balancing
  himself on the central perch.</p>

  <p>He greeted the girl with a grin.</p>

  <p>"My unworthy little bird has been sick all night. I have been sitting by
  his side, feeding him with sugar&mdash;from midnight till six o'clock this
  morning. And now he is better and will sing for us. Pi"&mdash;he addressed
  the yellow songster&mdash;"open your hideous little beak and emit unmusical
  noises for this honourable lady."</p>

  <p>"Feng, you are not telling the truth," said Elsa severely. "You weren't
  sitting up all night with your bird."</p>

  <p>The little man looked at her, blandly innocent. Then he turned his
  melancholy eyes to the bird.</p>

  <p>"Little Pi, if I sin lying, do not sing; but if I am speaking the truth,
  then let your ugly little throat produce contemptible melody."</p>

  <p>And as though he understood, the loyal little bird burst into a torrent of
  sunny song. Mr. Feng Ho smiled delightedly.</p>

  <p>"It is a peculiar and noteworthy fact," he said, with his best European
  manner, "that has been observed by every seeker after truth, from Confucius
  to Darwin, that the animal world&mdash;by which I refer to the world of
  vertebrate mammals&mdash;are the living embodiment of truth and the chief
  exponents of veracity. I will now, with your gracious permission, sit down
  and watch your vivacious fingers manipulate the keyboard of your honourable
  typewriter&mdash;to employ the idiom of our neighbours, but not friends, the
  Nipponese."</p>

  <p>He sat patiently, practically without a movement, except to turn his eyes
  from time to time to the bird, and there seemed some strange understanding
  between these two, for no sooner did Feng Ho's slit of a mouth open in a
  smile than the bird seemed to rock with musical laughter.</p>

  <p>Miss Dame came in while she was typing, dropped her jaw at the first view
  of the Chinaman, but graciously admitted that the canary was the best
  song-bird she had ever heard.</p>

  <p>"It must be a gentleman bird," she said. "Gentlemen birds always sing
  better than lady birds. And why shouldn't they? They've got less
  responsibility, if you understand me."</p>

  <p>She glanced coldly at the Chinaman as he nodded his agreement. "If you've
  got to lay eggs, you can't find time for keeping up your singing. Excuse me,
  do you know Sessuekawa?" This to Feng Ho, who expressed his grief that he had
  never heard of the gentleman.</p>

  <p>"He's the model of you," said Miss Dame, glaring at him. "Slightly better
  looking, if you'll excuse my rudeness, but that's probably the paint and
  powder he puts on his face. You've never seen him in 'The Bride of Fuji
  Yama'&mdash;that's a mountain?"</p>

  <p>The explanation was necessary because Miss Dame pronounced it "fujjy
  yammer."</p>

  <p>"You've missed a treat," she said regretfully when he shook his head. "He
  was simply marvellous, especially when he committed&mdash;what's the
  word?&mdash;haki raki?"</p>

  <p>Elsa refused to assist her, and paused in her work with such point that
  Miss Dame was conscious of the interruption she had produced, and
  retired.</p>

  <p>"A very pretty young lady," said Feng Ho, and Elsa, who thought he was
  being sarcastic, was prepared to snub him, but his next words demonstrated
  his sincerity. "The Eastern view differs considerably from the Western view.
  I can tell you that, speaking with authority as a bachelor of science."</p>

  <p>She wondered what special authority this particular bachelorhood conferred
  when it came to a question of judging looks, but wisely did not pursue the
  topic.</p>

  <p>When she got to the office she had found a note from Mrs. Trene Hallam. It
  would have been a letter from anybody else, for it occupied two sheets of
  notepaper; but Mrs. Hallam's calligraphy was not her strong point. The
  lettering was enormous, and ten words a page was a generous average.</p>

  <p><i>"You will come to-night at seven. I will have dinner ready for you, and
  I will drive you every morning to your ofice."</i> (She spelt "office" with
  one "f" Elsa noted.)</p>

  <p>There was a postscript:</p>

  <p><i>"Please don't tell Major Amery that you are staying with me. He may
  think I have some reason."</i></p>

  <p>The postscript annoyed her, though why she did not know. Perhaps it was
  the assumption that she would tell Major Amery anything about her private
  affairs.</p>

  <p>She saw her uncle only for a few minutes. Coming in from luncheon, she had
  to pass his door, which was open, and she saw him sitting at his table and
  would have gone on if he had not called her back.</p>

  <p>"Shut the door," he growled. "I've been to see my lawyer on a certain
  matter&mdash;and I've made my will."</p>

  <p>This was rather surprising news. She had never thought of her uncle as a
  man of means, or having property to dispose, and she could only utter a
  commonplace about the wisdom of taking such a precaution.</p>

  <p>"He's a shrewd fellow is Nigitts," he said, "very shrewd. And remarkably
  well up in the matter of"&mdash;he cleared his throat&mdash;"criminal law.
  The most one can get in this country for a certain offence is two years, and
  Nigitts says one would probably get away with less&mdash;if a statement was
  made voluntarily."</p>

  <p>She wondered what on earth he was talking about. Had he been drinking? His
  face was flushed, his eyes heavy with want of sleep, but from her own
  experience she thought he was sober.</p>

  <p>"I've had to give the matter a whole lot of thought&mdash;there are other
  people besides me involved in this... business," he said; "but I thought
  you'd like to know that I'd improved the shining hour"&mdash;his attempt to
  be jovial was pathetic&mdash;"and I've left you a little bit of money,
  although I don't suppose you will touch it for years. Would you like to be
  rich, Elsa?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her from between his narrowed eyes.</p>

  <p>"I suppose everybody would like to be rich," smiled the girl.</p>

  <p>"You'd like to be good and happy, eh? Like the girl in the story-book?" he
  sneered. And then: "What has Amery been doing all the morning?"</p>

  <p>"Working," she said.</p>

  <p>"Nothing unusual?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to take a look at some of his letters, Elsa. Anyway, I'm in the
  business, and Major Amery has no secrets from me. Where do you keep the copy
  file?"</p>

  <p>"Major Amery keeps his own copies in the safe," she said.</p>

  <p>He played with a blotter.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you shouldn't slip in a second carbon?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>There was no profit in discussing the matter with him.</p>

  <p>"I can't do that&mdash;you know very well I can't. It would be dishonest
  and mean, and I'd rather leave Amery's than do it."</p>

  <p>"You like him, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I loathe him," she said frankly, and his face brightened.</p>

  <p>"That's the kind of talk I like to hear, little girl. He's a swine, that
  fellow! There's nothing anybody could do to him that could be called
  mean."</p>

  <p>"I am the 'anybody' concerned, and there are some things I will not do,"
  she said, and walked out.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">XI. THE SYNDICATE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE were times when Ralph Hallam's mind went back to the
  days of romance, and conspirators, cloaked and masked, met in underground
  cellars to plan their dark deeds. Certainly there was the advantage of safety
  in that picturesque method&mdash;and Ralph played safe all the time. Such
  meetings gave to the leaders an anonymity which must have been
  comforting.</p>

  <p>This thought occurred to him as he went slowly up the stairs that led to
  No. 3, the largest of the private dining-rooms that the Café Fornos had to
  offer to its clients. For luncheon these rooms are very seldom bespoke, but
  once a month Dr. Hallam gave a little party where business men could meet,
  discuss politics, theatres, the contemporary events of sport, and when the
  coffee and liqueurs were served and cigar cases came to light, and when,
  moreover, the waiters had withdrawn, the peculiar business which brought them
  together.</p>

  <p>As Ralph stood in the doorway, smiling and nodding to the waiting guests,
  he decided that he had never seen an assembly that looked less like a meeting
  of conspirators. They were stoutish business men, lovers of good living,
  middle-aged, slightly or completely bald; men in the sober habiliments of
  their class. Jarvie of Birmingham greeted him warmly and looked past him,
  seemingly expecting a companion.</p>

  <p>"The old man couldn't get away," said Hallam easily. "He's not
  particularly well."</p>

  <p>He shook hands with the half-dozen of guests and took his seat. No. 3 had
  an outer and an inner door, and when at last the waiter had placed his
  cigar-boxes and liqueur bottles on the buffet and had withdrawn, Hallam
  walked to the doors, turned the key in both and came back to his chair.</p>

  <p>Instantly the company relaxed and the atmosphere changed. It was as
  though, for the past hour, everybody had been playing apart, and all that had
  been said and done was an act from a dull comedy.</p>

  <p>Without preamble Hallam spoke.</p>

  <p>"There are three new consignments, the largest in London, the second
  largest at Hull&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bonded or through the customs?" somebody asked.</p>

  <p>"Out of bond, of course," replied Hallam. "Jarvie, you will arrange the
  distribution. It is consigned to Stanford's Birmingham address. The second
  came into Avomnouth yesterday and goes forward to Philadelphia."</p>

  <p>"What about this Greek they caught at Cleveland?" asked Jarvie, and it was
  clear that this question was on the lips of the whole company, for there
  followed a babble of questions.</p>

  <p>"You need not worry about him, and the story of the American police
  tracing a doctor and a City merchant is all bunk. Some imaginative reporter
  invented that. No, that isn't our trouble. Bickerson&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hasn't anybody tried to straighten Bickerson?" asked a voice. "A couple
  of thousand would put him quiet."</p>

  <p>Ralph shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I know Bickerson: he's not that kind. And if you straightened him, he'd
  slack down, and the higher up people would put another man into the case, and
  he'd have to be straightened," said Hallam "The only man you need worry about
  is Tarn, who is getting cold feet. And Soyoka," he added.</p>

  <p>There was a glum silence at this. Soyoka was the spectre that walked at
  every man's elbow, the terror of the unknown. They were business men, each
  with his little bolt hole, his alibi, his ready explanation if the police by
  accident hit upon his story, and behind each was a reputation for commercial
  integrity that could not be gainsaid. Moral considerations did not concern
  them. That they were marketing a vile poison that wrecked men and women and
  drove them to insanity, hardly counted. They were marketing a commodity which
  paid enormous profits and for which there was an increasing demand.</p>

  <p>"Soyoka?"</p>

  <p>Jarvie took his cigar from his mouth, looked at it thoughtfully and put it
  back. He was a heavy-browed man with a fringe of hair above his collar and a
  shining head.</p>

  <p>"There's room for Soyoka," he said.</p>

  <p>"So I think," nodded Hallam, "but he doesn't share the view that there is
  room for two. Now I'm going to tell you fellows something. Old Tarn is
  certain that his boss is either Soyoka or Soyoka's leading agent!"</p>

  <p>"His boss? Who is he?" asked Jarvie, scowling at his chief.</p>

  <p>"Major Amery."</p>

  <p>Ralph saw the eyes of the beetle-browed man open wide.</p>

  <p>"Amery?" he said incredulously. "Not Paul Amery?"</p>

  <p>"Why, do you know him?" demanded the other.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jarvie was whistling softly.</p>

  <p>"Paul Amery! I wonder if it's the same? It's not Paul Amery of the Indian
  Political Service, by any chance? The man who got into trouble at
  Shanghai?"</p>

  <p>In his excitement Ralph pushed back his chair from the table.</p>

  <p>"Let us hear this," he said. "You've got the man right enough. Do you know
  him?"</p>

  <p>Jarvie shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't know him, but one of my managers knew him very well. We have
  a branch house in Shanghai: we export Brummagem goods and that kind of truck;
  and my manager, who came back a year ago on sick leave, was full of
  him&mdash;he is not by any chance connected with Tarn's firm, is he?"</p>

  <p>"He is Amery &amp; Amery," said Ralph. "His uncle left him the business
  some time back."</p>

  <p>Again Mr. Jarvie whistled.</p>

  <p>"I only know what my man told me. It appears that Amery was lent by the
  Indian Government to the Board of Control, or whatever they call it, in
  Shanghai. In Shanghai, as you probably know, there are three or four
  millionaire families that have made their money out of opium smuggling and
  running guns to the rebels. He was sent up to keep an eye upon the arms gang
  but got into the opium commission and had to leave suddenly. I don't know the
  rights of it, but my man says he was caught in the act of passing out opium.
  There was a tremendous scandal. There was a veiled reference to the case in
  the Shanghai press, but of course no reference to Amery, because these
  Europeans in Shanghai are pretty clannish. All that was known was that his
  name was taken off the roll of members of the French Club, and he disappeared
  by the first mail-boat. It was the gossip of the place that he was working
  with Soyoka, who has a pretty vivid reputation in the China Sea. There was
  also talk of his having knifed a Chinese policeman who was going to give him
  away. They say he's better that the best knife-thrower that ever starred in a
  circus. Learnt it up in Nepal, and never carries any other weapon. What makes
  Tarn think he's Soyoka?"</p>

  <p>"Something he said to him," replied Ralph, "some threat of his. If he is
  Soyoka's man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If he is Soyoka's man," interrupted Mr. Jarvie, "he's more dangerous than
  a bagful of rattlesnakes." He looked meditatively at Ralph. "Isn't there a
  way you could fix a fellow like that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;'fix'?" demanded Ralph bluntly, conscious that the
  curious eyes of the party were on him.</p>

  <p>"I don't mean anything illegal," said Mr. Jarvie virtuously, and he again
  examined his inspiring cigar. "But I think, if a fellow like that had a bit
  of a shock... well, he'd go carefully and probably save us a few
  uncomfortable minutes."</p>

  <p>This was evidently generally agreed. Somebody at the far end of the table
  murmured:</p>

  <p>"Not illegal, of course," though his tone hardly convinced.</p>

  <p>"There is only one way to stop Soyoka&mdash;if he is Soyoka," said Ralph
  coldly, "and that is to put him beyond the power of troubling us. Does
  anybody mean that?"</p>

  <p>Nobody apparently did mean that, for the company murmured a soothing
  denial.</p>

  <p>"No, what I mean," said Jarvie, who hesitated so long that apparently he
  was not quite sure of what he did mean, "is that, if he can't be
  straightened, he ought to be&mdash;frightened."</p>

  <p>He puffed at his cigar and looked up at the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"I don't know much about London: I'm a provincial man myself: but I'm told
  that there are places in this town where you could hire a man to beat up your
  own grandmother for a ten-pound note. Personally, I do not approve of
  violence: it is foreign to my nature. But there must be people
  who&mdash;ah&mdash;could scare&mdash;that is the word,
  scare&mdash;Amery."</p>

  <p>It was four o'clock when the luncheon party broke up, and Ralph went
  downstairs alone. In the vestibule he saw a very plump pleasant-looking
  gentleman being helped on with his greatcoat. At first he could not believe
  the evidence of his eyes, and then, glancing through the doorway, he saw a
  very sedate Rolls draw slowly up to the kerb, and a footman alight and open
  the door.</p>

  <p>"Why, Tupperwill," he said, "you're in a strange part of London!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill, proprietor of Stebbing's Banking Corporation, looked round
  leisurely. Every movement of his was deliberate, and his round blue eyes lit
  up in a stare of recognition.</p>

  <p>"My dear doctor," he murmured, "extraordinary&mdash;most extraordinary! A
  queer place for Stebbing's indeed, a very queer place!"</p>

  <p>In the City of London, Stebbing's Bank was respected without being
  considered. A survival of one of those private banking corporations that had
  come into existence in the early part of the eighteenth century, its business
  was comparatively small and its clientele extremely select. Stebbing's had
  resisted the encroachments of the great joint stock companies and maintained
  its independence largely on the tradition established by its founder, who in
  the early days of the firm had gone to prison for contempt of court rather
  than produce books which would have incriminated one of his clients. For
  generations men with great names put private accounts at
  Stebbing's&mdash;accounts which their confidential secretaries never scanned;
  for even the owners of great names have affairs and businesses of a
  peculiarly private kind, and Stebbing's flourished by its very secrecy.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill, its present proprietor, was wont to boast that he had not
  an employee under the age of fifty, though he himself was on the breezy side
  of thirty-five, a stout, youthful-looking man, with a large face, many chins,
  and hands of exceeding plumpness.</p>

  <p>"Heavy luncheons are anathema to me," He put his hand in his pocket,
  pulled out a little pile of silver and, selecting sixpence, handed it to the
  unsatisfied cloakroom attendant with a benevolent smile. "<i>Anathema
  maranatha!*</i> But some of my clients are rather sybaritic. 'Sybarite,' as
  you probably know, is the name given to the people of Sybaris, an ancient
  town of Greece, the citizens of which were given to self-indulgence and
  luxury."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* An allusion to 1st Corinthians 16:22: "If any man love
  not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha." In this context
  "anathema" means "cursed" and "maranatha" means "the Lord is coming." The
  passage as a whole means that if you warn people of the judgment to come and
  they laugh in your face, then they are choosing to go to Hell by their own
  free will.&mdash;RG]</p>

  <p>He said this with an air of revealing a mystery which hitherto had not
  been made public. This passion for passing on information was one of his
  characteristics, and it may be said that, in nine cases out often, he really
  did convey information to the City men with whom he was mostly brought into
  account.</p>

  <p>Ralph had his private account with Stebbing's, and in a way could claim a
  sort of friendship with the banker, who was a member of two of his clubs. If
  he had one drawback it was his mild interest in medicines&mdash;a source of
  embarrassment to Ralph, who had almost forgotten his early training.</p>

  <p>The fat man sighed heavily as he pulled on his gloves.</p>

  <p>"A glass of milk and a few crackers constitute my normal lunch, and I
  shudder to contemplate the effect that lobster mayonnaise would have upon my
  system. You're not coming my way?"</p>

  <p>Ralph was walking with him to the open door of his car.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not coming your way, though I shall be in your neighbourhood
  to-morrow or the next day."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill shivered.</p>

  <p>"I commiserate with you," he said. "The City lacks aestheticism&mdash;a
  cult which, as you may know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly, looked along the crowded sidewalk, and his fat chin
  wagged downward.</p>

  <p>"The cosmopolitan character of our streets at this period of the year is
  always to me a fascinating and interesting feature."</p>

  <p>Following the direction of his eyes, Ralph saw a man standing on the edge
  of the kerb; a slim little man, in a grey felt hat and violent yellow gloves.
  His face turned at that moment.</p>

  <p>"A Chinaman!" said Hallam in surprise.</p>

  <p>"A Chinaman," agreed the other soberly, "one Feng Ho, the bodyguard and
  <i>fidus achates Asiaticus</i> of one Major Amery, an astonishing
  gentleman."</p>

  <p>Before Ralph had recovered from his astonishment sufficiently to ask what
  the banker knew of Paul Amery, the glistening car was threading its way
  through the traffic, on its way to the inaesthetic purlieus of Old Broad
  Street.</p>

  <p>The Chinaman was looking steadfastly toward him, but made no move to
  approach, and presently, when Ralph began to walk in his direction, he turned
  and moved swiftly away and was lost to sight in the crowd.</p>

  <p>Feng Ho, Amery's man! It was the first time Ralph had heard of the
  Chinaman, and he wanted to get a closer view of him. If all that he had heard
  that day was true...</p>

  <p>But Feng Ho had disappeared, and, looking at his watch, Ralph remembered
  that he had promised to make a call on his wife. He was paying the cabman at
  the entrance of Herbert Mansions when, looking round, he saw another cab stop
  a little distance down the road. A man got out. It was Feng Ho!</p>

  <p>Ralph did not hesitate. He went toward the second cab, and the Chinaman
  awaited his coming with an expressionless face.</p>

  <p>"I want a word with you, my friend."</p>

  <p>Feng Ho's head bent slightly.</p>

  <p>"When I came out of the Fornos a quarter of an hour ago, you were standing
  on the sidewalk, obviously watching me. Not content with that, you have
  followed me here. Now what is your little game?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ho's grin was as expansive as it was unsightly.</p>

  <p>"Little game? I have no little game," he said blandly. "I merely come this
  way; perhaps to-morrow I go some other way."</p>

  <p>"You're making a call&mdash;where?" asked Ralph roughly.</p>

  <p>Feng Ho lifted his thin shoulders in a shrug.</p>

  <p>"That is not good English politeness," he said. "There is a policeman," he
  nodded in the direction of a patrol. "Perhaps you will send for him and say:
  'Take this Chinaman and put him in the cooler. His name is Feng Ho, he is a
  Bachelor of Science and he has followed me.' Mr. Hallam, you cannot go
  anywhere in London without following somebody."</p>

  <p>"Why do you follow me?" asked Hallam, ignoring the logic of the
  statement.</p>

  <p>Again that little shrug.</p>

  <p>"I am bachelor of science, interested in phenomena. My speciality is
  &mdash;crime! Not only do I like to attend the court when a man comes up
  before the judge and hear the story, but I wish to see the crime when it is
  committed. A depraved and morbid ambition, Mr. Hallam, but you as doctor of
  medicine will understand."</p>

  <p>"What crime do you expect to see here?" asked Hallam, watching him
  narrowly.</p>

  <p>"Murder," was the startling reply.</p>

  <p>"Murder!" Ralph wondered if the man were joking, but there was no trace of
  a smile on his immobile face.</p>

  <p>"Murder," repeated Feng Ho, his face beaming. "When Soyoka kills you, I
  desire to be near, so that I may see ingenious methods employed. That he may
  kill antediluvian gentleman Tarn is possible, or sprightly Miss Marlowe, but
  that he will inevitably and completely kill <i>you</i>, you shall find!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12">XII. AMERY KNOWS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For a second Ralph Hallam experienced a wild sense of panic.
  The very matter-of-factness of the man's tone sent a cold chill down his
  spine. Fighting hard against the eerie sensation which for the moment
  overwhelmed him, he presently found his voice.</p>

  <p>"I see," said he between his teeth. "I am to accept that as a warning from
  Soyoka, eh? Now listen to me, Chink! You can take this to Soyoka with my
  compliments&mdash;that if he starts anything in this country, he's going to
  get hurt. You understand that? And the next time I catch you shadowing me
  around, you will be kicked. Is that clear to you, Mr. Bachelor of
  Science?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ho grinned.</p>

  <p>"To be kicked will be no new experience, learned sir; for when I was a
  poor Chinese boy many men kicked me. But now I am a man it is different, and
  people who kick me lose their toes&mdash;so!"</p>

  <p>Quicker than eye could see, he had stooped. There was a swish of steel and
  the point of a knife, which had appeared as if by magic in his hand, scraped
  a straight white line that missed the toe of Hallam's boot by an
  infinitesimal fraction of an inch. He was erect again, the knife had
  disappeared, and he was his urbane, grinning self when Ralph stepped back
  with an involuntary cry.</p>

  <p>"Too quickness of hand frequently deceives optical observation," said Feng
  Ho complacently. "How rapidly could a kicking doctor of medicines become a
  'late,' with wreaths an suitable adornments of a post-mortem character!"</p>

  <p>And then, as though he himself recognized the futility of further
  argument, he turned, back to the astounded cabman, gave him instructions,
  and, stepping quickly into the cab, was whisked away before Ralph could
  recover from his amazement.</p>

  <p>Lou was out. Keeping appointments was not her strongest suit, and, having
  heartily cursed her, he went back to Maida Vale in search of another taxi. He
  was hardly home before she rang him up. She had been out to make some
  purchases in view of the coming of her guest that night.</p>

  <p>"And I might have saved myself the trouble, for she's just telephoned to
  say that she won't be able to come tonight, as she has some work to do at
  home."</p>

  <p>"You saw Amery?" he asked, and noted the acid that came into her
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw the pig! Do you know what he had the nerve to say to me?"</p>

  <p>Ralph raised his eyebrows and smiled to himself. "Can you guess?" she
  asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I guess he referred to your unfortunate habit of acquiring other people's
  property," he said coolly. "Lou, one of these days, your intelligent
  kleptomania is going to get you into serious trouble. I've heard one or two
  oblique references to the coincidence of your presence in India with the
  disappearance of movable property. You're a fool! You have enough money to
  live on, without indulging in that vice of yours. I never open a paper and
  see the headline 'Woman Shoplifter Charged' without wondering whether you're
  going to scandalize me."</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry!" she snapped. "And if you think I am likely to help
  myself to this girl's jewels, you'd better not send her to me."</p>

  <p>"She hasn't anything worth stealing," said Ralph coolly. "What else did
  Amery say?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she exploded, "except, of course, he knows that I'm your wife.
  And what's the use of swearing? I didn't tell him."</p>

  <p>"How did he know unless you betrayed yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you I didn't! He knew. He must have been having Herbert Mansions
  watched, as he told me exactly the minute you'd left the flat. Which reminds
  me," she said, in a changed voice. "I had a burglar in the flat last night,
  when I was at the theatre."</p>

  <p>"A burglar?" he repeated. "Did you lose anything?"</p>

  <p>"No, that is the curious thing. He opened my jewel safe, but nothing was
  missing. The janitor thinks he must have been disturbed. I'm quite sure he
  searched my little writing-desk, because I distinctly remember leaving my
  address book on top of some papers, and when I looked this morning it was
  underneath."</p>

  <p>There was a long pause. Ralph Hallam thought quickly. Was that the
  explanation of Feng Ho's presence near Herbert Mansions? Was he watching Mrs.
  Hallam as well as her husband, occupying his spare time by a closer
  inspection of her belongings?</p>

  <p>"Did you report it to the police?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, it wasn't worthwhile," she replied. And then, impatiently:</p>

  <p>"When is that girl coming? She's a bit shy, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"I'll let you know," he said, and hung up.</p>

  <p>Paul Amery had assumed a new significance.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">XIII. THE SCANDAL OF SHANGHAI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT would have been unnatural if Elsa Marlowe had not her
  conception of the ideal man. And he had no face, figure or dimensions, being
  mainly character and behaviour. Her ideal man did not order girls about as
  though they were machines; he did not resent a civil "Good-morning," or
  scowl, or fire out interminable letters; he did not dismiss the humblest of
  his employees with a curt nod; and, whatever kind of face he had, it most
  certainly was not disfigured by an ugly sneer.</p>

  <p>That morning at breakfast Mr. Tarn had made a brief reference to his
  conversation of the previous day, but happily had not pursued the subject.
  She would have to leave him: that was clear. But it was not going to be easy.
  The association of many years could not be lightly broken; and somehow the
  more she thought of Mrs. Trene Hallam's offer, even as a temporary measure,
  the less she liked the idea.</p>

  <p>Maurice Tarn seemed to grow more and more depressed as the days
  progressed. Though she was not feeling any too friendly toward him, she added
  his misery to the account of her uncouth employer.</p>

  <p>Just before lunch Amery sent for her and dictated instructions to be
  followed if a telephone call came through for him during his absence. She
  noted, with feminine interest, that he was wearing a new grey suit, and
  thought it was an improvement, though by contrast with the light material his
  face looked darker and more forbidding than ever.</p>

  <p>When he had finished dictating, he leant back in his chair, and his eyes
  wandered to the window. Not least of his unpleasant practices was to talk
  without looking at her.</p>

  <p>"Have you any friends in Shanghai?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I, Major Amery? No," she said, surprised by the query.</p>

  <p>"Queer place&mdash;full of scandal. I suppose you hear fragments of
  gossip&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>"No. I know there is such a place as Shanghai, and of course we have
  letters from our agents there, but I've heard no scandal or gossip. About
  whom?" she asked daringly.</p>

  <p>"Me, mostly... I wondered," he said.</p>

  <p>She was fired with a natural curiosity. What kind of scandal or gossip
  could touch this inhuman man? Yet he must be human on some side.</p>

  <p>"Queer place, Shanghai. You know why the bandits held up the blue train? I
  suppose you don't."</p>

  <p>The colour and the mystery of the East were comprehended in that short
  question. She remembered reading something about bandits wrecking a train,
  robbing the passengers and holding them to ransom, and she wished now that
  she had given the item of news a closer study.</p>

  <p>If she had expected him to refresh her memory, she was to be
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>"There is a lot of money to be made in Shanghai&mdash;straight and
  otherwise," he said, "but mostly otherwise. That will do!"</p>

  <p>As her busy fingers flickered above the keyboard of the typewriter, she
  found herself wondering which method of making money most appealed to the
  sinister man, and supposed that he was not very particular, for the
  acquisition of money seemed to be his principal occupation just then.</p>

  <p>A few weeks before, he had begun to institute a system of economy.
  Superfluous clerks had been discharged; new printed warnings had appeared
  above every electric light switch. He was in the habit of making unexpected
  appearances in the lower office, where row after row of clerks stood at their
  high desks, and there had been summary dismissals. Once he had surprised a
  flushed, dishevelled girl, her eyes bright with anger, and had instantly
  discovered the cause. She had come from one of the little offices which
  housed the various sub-managers of departments, and, without a word to the
  girl, Amery had walked into the bureau and with a crook of his finger had
  summoned to him its middle-aged occupant.</p>

  <p>"You tried to kiss that girl, I think?" he said.</p>

  <p>"If she says that, she's a liar&mdash;" began the manager.</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> say that," said the sinister Amery, his lip up. "See the cashier
  and draw your salary up to to-day: you're fired!"</p>

  <p>Lawyers' letters had followed this incident, and Elsa had typed a few of
  the acrid replies. The matter had come up when she was called in to take a
  letter to the sub-manager's legal representative, and she ventured to put in
  a word for him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sturl has been ten years in the firm," she said. "He's a married man
  with a family. Don't you think you're rather hard on him?"</p>

  <p>He transfixed her for a second with that granite look of his, and
  then:</p>

  <p>"I am not in need of advice," he said.</p>

  <p>She was so furious that she could have thrown her book at him.</p>

  <p>It was characteristic of the change which had come over the business that
  Mr. Tarn had not been consulted about this dismissal, and even more
  remarkable that he was too far gone in gloom to resent his overlooking.</p>

  <p>She met him as she was going out to lunch. It was so unusual for him to
  leave the office until he left it in the evening that she almost asked him
  where he was going. She checked herself in time, though he could not have
  been ruder to her than Amery had been. On one thing she was determined; she
  was leaving this establishment at the earliest opportunity. The man had so
  got on her nerves that she loathed the very sight and sound of him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tarn would have been glad to have such definite views. His mind was in
  a whirl. Plan after plan occurred to him, only to be rejected, and there
  seemed no pleasant prospect in life but the quiet of a remote ranch in a
  foreign country, and the solace of mind that obscurity would bring.</p>

  <p>Ralph Hallam had telephoned to him to come to lunch, and it was to the
  little house in Half Moon Street that his steps were directed.</p>

  <p>"I've had a talk with the crowd," said Ralph, when Tarn was seated before
  a luncheon which would have choked him to eat, "and they agreed that it would
  be best if you got away. Your nerves are gone, and this fellow Amery looks
  like smashing up one side of our organization."</p>

  <p>"It's smashed," groaned Tarn. "Not another ounce can come in through Amery
  &amp; Amery. I wish to God I'd never come into the game! Look at this: it was
  left for me this morning."</p>

  <p>His trembling fingers dived into the inside of his frock coat and brought
  out a letter, which he handed across the table to the other. It was written
  on very thick and very cheap notepaper, in a hand obviously disguised.
  Without preliminary it began:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"You are poaching on our preserves, and thanks to your
  blundering folly, the police are working double shifts. We are willing to
  give you £100,000 for the business, you to hand over your agents and agree to
  dissolve your organization. If you do not accept this offer, we will find a
  way of clearing you out."</p><br>

  <p>It was signed with a capital "S".</p>

  <p>Ralph handed the letter back with a smile.</p>

  <p>"If it's worth a hundred thousand pounds to them, it may be worth a
  million to us. Why did they send it to you, do you think? Because they knew
  you were the one scared chap in the organization! When did you get this?"</p>

  <p>"I found it on my desk this morning when I arrived at the office. Nobody
  seems to know how it got there."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Amery could explain," said the other drily. "Did he arrive before
  you?"</p>

  <p>The old man nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to quit," he said. "We'll cut up the money: there's enough to
  make us both rich."</p>

  <p>"You've got it in ready cash, of course?"</p>

  <p>"How else?" said the other impatiently. "If I'd followed your advice, I'd
  have put it in that fool Stebbing's Bank, and when we went to draw it we'd
  have found two Scotland Yard men waiting on the doorstep. The money's all
  right," said Tarn, cheerful for the first time that day. "We'll divide up at
  the end of the week. I've booked my passage."</p>

  <p>"You're a queer old devil." said Ralph, something amused, "and you're
  sacrificing a fortune. But I think&mdash;we all think&mdash;that you're wise
  to take this step."</p>

  <p>He got up from the table, lighting his cigar, and blew a ring to the
  ceiling.</p>

  <p>"You'll go alone, of course?"</p>

  <p>Tarn shifted uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I shall," he growled, "but that's no concern of yours."</p>

  <p>"It is a very big concern of mine. I've already explained to you, my dear
  fellow, that Elsa is necessary to me. To be biologically exact, you have more
  brains than she; but she's smarter than you, and, with a little instruction,
  will more than take your place. Now kill that crazy May-and-December bug
  that's tormenting you. Go away by all means; you'll be a happier man the
  moment the Lizard's astern; and if you are serious about your matrimonial
  project, why, South America is still full of very beautiful young ladies who
  would jump at the opportunity of marrying a man with your wad. And honestly,
  Tarn, I think you'll be a lucky man to get away alive."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded the other, startled.</p>

  <p>"I mean this, that Soyoka is going to be very busy, and you're better out
  of it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">XIV. SCREENING MAJOR AMERY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ALL that afternoon Maurice Tarn sat before his writing-
  table, his hands thrust deep in his pockets, his shoulders bent, his eyes
  half-closed, Hallam's warning in his ears. He was fifty-six, and life and
  liberty were very dear to him. And he wanted&mdash;very badly he
  wanted&mdash;to think singly. That was a term he invented himself. And all
  the time he was thinking trebly, three lines of thought running parallel,
  only to come together at short intervals into one confused, embrangled mass,
  until they so interlaced and overlapped, and ran one into the other, that he
  could not extricate them for an eternity of time.</p>

  <p>And then, in the blackest hour of his gloom, came the discovery which was
  destined, though this he could not know, to bring catastrophe in its
  train.</p>

  <p>"A cablegram, sir," said a clerk. "I think it is in the private code."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" He gazed gloomily at the paper that had been laid before him.
  Looking absently at the signature, he sat up with a jerk.</p>

  <p>The sender was a Japanese merchant with whom he had had some dealings on
  behalf of his nefarious syndicate. Soyoka had discovered this, and that
  source of supply had suddenly stopped. But it was the presence of a name in
  plain English in the very middle of the cablegram that left him gasping, and
  he hastened to find his secret code-book and write out the message.</p>

  <p>And then he saw what had happened. By some aberration of memory the cable
  that was addressed to him was intended for Soyoka's principal agent. The
  discovery left him shaken. The name in plain English! Soyoka! He had his
  rival in the hollow of his hand, and his soul was filled with a wild, savage
  sense of exhilaration which he had not known in years. That was what had
  happened: the message had been sent to his private telegraphic address... in
  error.</p>

  <p>He sat back in his chair, his breath coming quickly, his face flushed; and
  thus Elsa found him when she came in to mention that she might be away that
  night. He did not even reply to her, and her very natural conclusion, drawn
  from his flushed face and bright eyes, was that he had been drinking.</p>

  <p>Soyoka... in the hollow of his hand! So they would threaten him, would
  they? He would show them.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Elsa was going home that night, and had turned into Cheapside, when she
  saw a familiar figure crossing the road toward her.</p>

  <p>"Why, Ralph!" she said. "What are you doing in this industrious quarter of
  London? I never associate you with the City."</p>

  <p>"I had to come East to see a man," he said, failing into step by her side.
  "Are you taking a lordly taxi, or are you being democratic and boarding a
  bus?"</p>

  <p>"I'm being healthful and walking," she laughed.</p>

  <p>They passed along Newgate Street, turned into the Old Bailey, and stopped
  to admire the pompous face of the Central Criminal Courts. To Ralph the
  building had a peculiar interest, and he pointed out where Newgate Prison had
  stood, the place where the little narrow wicket, festooned with irons, had
  opened into the gloomy gaol.</p>

  <p>"It makes me shiver," she said, and turned away.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet it makes Maurice shiver too," he said incautiously, and she
  stopped and faced him.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong with Mr. Tarn?" she asked. "He has done something terrible,
  hasn't he? Do you know what it is?"</p>

  <p>But he turned the discussion with a laugh. He was glad enough to reach
  Elgin Crescent, for he was no pedestrian.</p>

  <p>"You're staying at Lou's place to-night&mdash;you promised her yesterday
  when you put her off. Have you told the old man?"</p>

  <p>She had spoken to Tarn that afternoon, but doubted if he had taken in what
  she had said. For some reason which she could not define, she dreaded this
  coming visit.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure that Mr. Tarn understood me," she said.</p>

  <p>"Need you tell him?" he asked quietly. "Maurice is sore with me, for some
  reason, and I have an idea that, if he knows that you're going to Lou's
  place, he'll raise objections."</p>

  <p>"But what can I say?" she asked in astonishment. "I can't tell him a
  lie."</p>

  <p>"Tell him you're going to spend a week with a friend. If I know him
  rightly, he won't bother to ask you who it is."</p>

  <p>It did not seem entirely to her liking, but she agreed.</p>

  <p>"I'll lend you my moral support," he said gaily, and, changing his
  original intention, which was to leave her at the door, he went in with her,
  to find, as she had expected, that Maurice Tarn had not yet returned.</p>

  <p>She left him in the dining-room while she went upstairs to pack a bag.
  Again that little doubt entered her mind. She did not like Mrs. Trene Hallam;
  but she disliked her no more than she would any other stranger, and possibly
  she would improve upon acquaintance. And there was a very excellent reason
  why she should go away for a little time. Instinctively she knew that the
  moment of Maurice Tarn's crisis was at hand, and what might be involved in
  its culmination she dared not let herself think.</p>

  <p>She took longer over her packing than she had intended, for there had
  arisen a new and preposterous consideration. Would Paul Amery approve?
  Preposterous indeed! She laughed at herself and resumed her packing. When she
  came downstairs, Ralph stretched in the big armchair by the window, was
  looking out upon the youth of Elgin Crescent at play.</p>

  <p>"The noise these young devils make must get on Maurice' nerves," he said.
  "What does he do in the evenings&mdash;drink?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. It was distasteful to her to discuss her guardian.</p>

  <p>"He hasn't changed his habits," she said.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not if I know him. I'll tell you what he does," said Ralph
  slowly. "You can check me if I'm wrong. He finishes his dinner at half-past
  eight, goes to his study at a quarter to nine has his usual four brandy
  liqueurs, and then starts in serious to increase the liquor consumption."</p>

  <p>Elsa sighed.</p>

  <p>"He wasn't always like this. It is only during the past few years that he
  has been drinking," she said.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"A queer devil is Maurice. I wish to heaven he'd go to South America."</p>

  <p>"With me?" she smiled.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not with you. I'm not going to let him take you away."</p>

  <p>She very hastily changed the subject.</p>

  <p>At eight o'clock Mr. Tarn had not arrived, and he went away, after vainly
  trying to persuade her to let him accompany her to Herbert Mansions.</p>

  <p>"I can't do that," she said, shaking her head. "It wouldn't be fair to him
  to go away only leaving a message with the servants. I must see him and
  explain."</p>

  <p>"Loyal lady!" he said with a smile. Somehow she did not like his tone.</p>

  <p>After he had gone, it occurred to her that, with every opportunity and
  every inducement, she had not told him about Feng Ho's midnight visit. It was
  curious that she had not done so. And it was not because she had forgotten
  that she had not told him. Twice it had been on the tip of her tongue to
  narrate her midnight adventure, and something had stopped her. And then
  later, as she heard the unsteady hand of Maurice Tarn put a key in the lock
  of the lower door, the explanation came to her and left her wondering at
  herself. She had not told him because she was screening Paul Amery!</p>

  <h2><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15">XV. THE MAN IN THE ROOM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">INSPECTOR WILLIAM BICKERSON had written the last line of a
  very long report to headquarters; he blotted, folded and enclosed the
  document, and, looking up at the clock, saw it was a quarter to nine. It was
  at that moment that his clerk came in to ask him if he would see Dr. Ralph
  Hallam.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Hallam?" said the inspector, in surprise. "Why, surely!"</p>

  <p>He greeted Ralph as an old friend.</p>

  <p>"It is a hundred years since I saw you last, doctor," he said warmly.
  Again his eyes wandered to the clock. "And I wish I had time to have a chat
  with you, but I've an appointment at nine. Did you want to see me about
  anything particular?"</p>

  <p>"If you consider the dope gangs are something particular, then I did."</p>

  <p>The inspector whistled.</p>

  <p>"The dope gangs? Do you know anything about them?"</p>

  <p>"I know very little, but I guess a lot; and I suppose you can do some
  guessing for yourself."</p>

  <p>The inspector did not reply. "You're a friend of Mr. Tarn's, aren't you?"
  Ralph nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am a friend. We have been much greater friends than we are at the
  present moment."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with him?"</p>

  <p>Ralph shrugged. "I don't know exactly. Booze, I should imagine. He has
  taken it rather badly. Why do you ask if am a friend of his?"</p>

  <p>The officer considered a moment.</p>

  <p>"Because he's the fellow I'm going to see at nine. He asked me to come
  round, said he had something very important to say. In fact, he gave me to
  understand that he had an important statement to make. Do you think that was
  booze?"</p>

  <p>Ralph was cautious here.</p>

  <p>"It may be," he said, and bit his lip. "What kind of statement?" The
  inspector shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Are you his doctor?"</p>

  <p>"I have been, though I'm afraid my medical knowledge isn't worth boasting
  about. At nine o'clock, you say? Would you mind if I went with you?"</p>

  <p>Again the officer glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"No, you can come along, though if it is serious, I don't suppose he'll
  want to say much before you."</p>

  <p>"In which case I can go," said Ralph.</p>

  <p>Bickerson had arisen when the telephone bell rang, and he took up the
  instrument.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he called, and Ralph saw his eyebrows rise. "It's our friend,"
  said the detective in a low voice, putting the receiver out of range.</p>

  <p>"Is that you?"</p>

  <p>It was Maurice Tarn's voice, thick and slurred, almost
  indistinguishable.</p>

  <p>"That you, Bickerson?... You coming round to see me? They tried to get me
  to-night... yes, to-night!... She's in it... I wouldn't be surprised. She's
  ungrateful, after all I've done..."</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about, Mr. Tarn?" asked the detective sharply. "I'm
  on my way now."</p>

  <p>"Come as quickly as you can. I can put you right about Soyoka&mdash;I know
  his principal agent!"</p>

  <p>He whispered a word, and Bickerson's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>There was a click as the receiver was hung up. The inspector turned to his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"He's drunk," he said.</p>

  <p>"What did he say?"</p>

  <p>But Bickerson was so overwhelmed by that whispered word that he did not
  answer.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't take a great deal of notice of what he said," suggested
  Ralph, concealing his anxiety. "The old fool is pickled! Why, he wants to
  marry his niece!"</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said Bickerson, deep in thought. "I've found some drunkards
  remarkably talkative. Will you come?"</p>

  <p>From the police station to Elgin Crescent was ten minutes' walk, and the
  detective had an opportunity for adding to his knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Where is the girl&mdash;does she live in the same house?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Usually, but to-night she's staying with a relative of mine. The truth
  is, she has had a fairly bad time with him," said Hallam, "and Tarn's getting
  worse. He's scared of Soyoka's crowd."</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>The officer checked his step and stared at the other in wonder.
  "Soyoka&mdash;what do you know of that gang anyway?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the other promptly. "That is one of his crazy delusions. I
  came to see you especially to tell you about that, and to warn you as far as
  Tarn is concerned. It is his obsession that he has offended Soyoka."</p>

  <p>Every police officer has had experience of that kind of delusion. Never
  was a great crime committed but some lunatic produced a confession, and his
  enthusiasm for the interview was a little damped. Dr. Ralph Hallam desired
  that it should be.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why," said Bickerson as they turned the corner of Ladbroke
  Grove, "but I had an idea all the time that Tarn wanted to see me in
  connection with the drug cases. No, he never said so; it was just a hunch.
  And here we are. You go first&mdash;you know your way."</p>

  <p>Together they mounted the steps, the inspector following through the
  broad, open portal. Half-way up the passage they were confronted by the
  doors, one of which led to the lower part and the other to the upper-floor
  flat which Mr. Tarn and his niece occupied. Ralph pressed the bell, and when
  no answer came, pressed it again.</p>

  <p>"It looks as if it is open," said the inspector suddenly, and pushed.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the door swung back. They passed to the foot of the
  stairs, and Ralph felt for the switch. After a while he turned it down, but
  no light appeared.</p>

  <p>"That is queer," he said. "The lamp must have burnt out." Feeling their
  way by the wall, they mounted to the first landing; "This is his study," said
  Hallam, as he touched a door-knob, and turned it.</p>

  <p>The door opened. The only light in the room was the dull glow of a small
  fire, which gave no illumination whatever.</p>

  <p>"Are you there, Mr. Tarn?" called the inspector. For answer came a deep
  snore.</p>

  <p>"Is there a light anywhere?"</p>

  <p>The detective's hand swept along the wall, and Ralph hear the click of a
  switch. But again the lights failed to show.</p>

  <p>"That's queer&mdash;where is he?"</p>

  <p>It was easy to locate the snorer. Presently Ralph's hand rested on the
  back of a big armchair and, reaching down, he felt a bristly face.</p>

  <p>"He is here," he said.</p>

  <p>At the touch of the visitor's hand, Maurice Tarn moved uneasily. They
  heard his drowsy grunt, and then, like a man speaking in his sleep, he spoke
  thickly.</p>

  <p>"They tried to get me under... I know... but I'm too strong... got the
  constitution of a horse..."</p>

  <p>The words died away in a rumble of sound.</p>

  <p>"Wake up, Tarn," said Ralph. "Mr. Bickerson has come to see you."</p>

  <p>He shook the man by the shoulder and the snores ceased.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you're going to have a difficulty in rousing him."</p>

  <p>"Is he awake?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. Tarn! Wake up!" Then, suddenly:</p>

  <p>"There's somebody else in the room!" said the inspector sharply. "Have you
  a match, doctor?"</p>

  <p>He had heard the thud of a falling chair, and strained his eyes to pierce
  the darkness. Even as he looked, he heard a rustle near lie door, lurched out
  and caught the shoulder of the unknown intruder. There was a sibilant hiss of
  sound; three Chinese words that sounded like the howl of a dog; a bony fist
  caught the officer under the jaw; and in an instant the stranger had jerked
  from the detective's grasp, slipped through the door and slammed it. They
  heard the patter of his feet on the stairs.</p>

  <p>"A light, quick!" cried Bickerson hoarsely.</p>

  <p>From Ralph's direction came the rattle of a matchbox, a light spluttered
  and flared. As if in answer to his cry, the electric lights suddenly blazed
  up, momentarily blinding them.</p>

  <p>"Who did that&mdash;?" And then: "Hell&mdash;look!" hissed the detective,
  and gaped in horror at the sight.</p>

  <p>Maurice Tarn lay huddled in his chair, his head thrown back. His soiled
  white waistcoat was red and wet, and from the crimson welter protruded the
  black handle of a knife.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" breathed Hallam. "Killed whilst we were here."</p>

  <p>He heard the detective's cry and saw him glare past him.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;?" he began, and then he saw.</p>

  <p>Crouched in the farther corner of the room was a white-faced girl. Her
  dress was in disorder, her white blouse was torn at the shoulder; across her
  face was a red smear of blood.</p>

  <p>It was Elsa Marlowe!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap16"
     id="chap16">XVI. ELSA'S SECRET</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BICKERSON gave one glance at the girl, hesitated a second,
  and then, running to the door, flung it open and flew down the stairs. The
  street was empty, except for a woman who was walking toward him. Far away, at
  the corner of Ladbroke Grove, he saw a bored policeman standing, and he raced
  across the road toward the officer, who did not seem aware of his presence
  until he was on top of him.</p>

  <p>"Go to 409, Elgin Crescent," he said breathlessly. "Hold the door and
  allow nobody to come in or out. A murder has been committed. Blow your
  whistle: I want another constable. You saw nobody come out of 409, Elgin
  Crescent?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; only one man has passed me in the last few minutes and that was
  a Chinaman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A Chinaman?" said Bickerson quickly. "How was he dressed?"</p>

  <p>"He was dressed in the height of fashion, as far as I could see, and I
  noticed him because he wore no hat. But a good many of these Easterners don't
  wear hats&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bickerson interrupted the dissertation on the customs of the East.</p>

  <p>"Which way did he go?"</p>

  <p>"Down Ladbroke Grove. He took a cab: I was watching him getting into it
  just before you came up, sir. There it goes."</p>

  <p>He pointed to the hill leading to Notting Hill Gate, and Bickerson looked
  round for a taxi to pursue, but there was none in sight.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about the house: go after that cab. Sound your whistle and see
  if you can get it stopped. There's another man on point duty farther along,
  isn't there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the constable, and went off at a jog-trot in pursuit of
  the taxi, which had vanished over the brown of the hill.</p>

  <p>Bickerson hurried back to the flat. Whoever the intruder was, Elsa Marlowe
  would have to account for her presence.</p>

  <p>When he got back, he found Elsa in the dining-room. She was very white but
  remarkably calm. The blood smear that had been on her face was gone, and the
  handkerchief in Ralph Hallam's hand explained its absence. She turned to him
  as she came in.</p>

  <p>"Is it true?" she asked. "Mr. Hallam says that my&mdash;my uncle has been
  murdered."</p>

  <p>The detective nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you see?"</p>

  <p>"No." It was Ralph who answered him. "I turned the light out. There are
  things which I shouldn't want her to see, and that was one of them. I
  switched off the lights before I brought her out. And thank God she hadn't
  seen it." Bickerson looked again at the girl.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss Marlowe, your uncle has been killed."</p>

  <p>"That&mdash;that man did it," she said.</p>

  <p>"What man?" asked the detective sharply.</p>

  <p>She struggled hard to control her voice, but the experience of the last
  two hours had brought her as near to hysteria as she had ever been in her
  life.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you everything from the start," she said. "I was going away
  to-night, to stay with&mdash;with a friend; and I waited at home to tell Mr.
  Tarn that I should not be returning for a week. And then he asked me where I
  was going. I hoped he would not, because there was a possibility that he
  might object; but I told him, and from that moment he behaved more like a
  madman than a rational being. He raved and screamed at me, called me the most
  terrible names, and in his fury he threw a glass at me."</p>

  <p>She lifted her hair and showed a cut which, slight as it was, had matted
  the hair with blood.</p>

  <p>"This happened in the dining-room; and then, suddenly, before I realized
  what was happening, he grasped me by the arm and pushed me into the study. I
  think he must have been drinking before he came in. He sometimes stops at an
  hotel on his way and spends hours there.</p>

  <p>"You sit down and wait till I tell you to move,' he said; 'you are not
  going out tonight.' I tried to reason with him, but he was like a man
  demented, and I could only sit patiently, watching him pour out glass after
  glass of brandy, and wait for an opportunity to make my escape from the room.
  Once I thought he was sleeping, and got up softly to go. He opened his eyes
  and sprang up, and flung me back on the settee in a corner of the room. I was
  terrified. I don't think I have been so frightened in my life. I thought he
  must have gone mad, and I really believe he had.</p>

  <p>"Presently he went to sleep again, and then I hadn't the courage to move.
  He was talking all the time of what he was going to do to somebody. And then,
  suddenly&mdash;this was about ten minutes ago&mdash;the lights went out.
  There are heavy curtains before the windows of Mr. Tarn's study, and these
  were drawn. Except for the very small illumination that the fire gave, there
  was no light at all in the room. I sat still, dreading his waking up, and
  hoping that presently he would be far enough under the influence of drink to
  make my escape possible. Whilst I was thinking this, I heard the door creak,
  and had a feeling that there was somebody in the room. I was sure of it a
  second later, for quite unexpectedly a bright ray of light shot out and
  focused Mr. Tarn."</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>"I can see him now, with his head rolled over on to his shoulder his hands
  clasped on his chest. The light half woke him and he began to talk."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear Mr. Tarn telephone?" interrupted the detective.</p>

  <p>The girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was more than a quarter of an hour ago. I heard him speak to
  somebody&mdash;it was you, I think. You're Mr. Bickerson, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>The detective nodded.</p>

  <p>"Go on, please," he said. "When the man put the light on your uncle, did
  it wake him up?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No; he stirred in his sleep and talked. Then the light went off. I dared
  not move, thinking it was a housebreaker. And then I heard your voice coming
  up the stairs... that is all I know."</p>

  <p>"You didn't see this unknown man stab your uncle?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It was impossible to see anything."</p>

  <p>The detective rubbed his chin irritably.</p>

  <p>"He was quick: I'll give him that credit. The poor old chap must have been
  killed whilst I was within a few feet of him. This will be a fine story to
  make public!"</p>

  <p>He looked suspiciously at the girl.</p>

  <p>"I shall want your evidence of course. I'd like you to be somewhere where
  I can get you at a moment's notice. Why not go to an hotel?"</p>

  <p>"I'll get a room for you at the Palace Hotel," said Ralph.</p>

  <p>He had no especial desire that Herbert Mansions should be a place of call
  for the police in the next few days; he wanted, if possible, to keep his
  wife's name out of the case, for fear that the connection between her and
  himself became public. Perhaps Elsa understood that he did not want to bring
  his "sister-in-law's" name into the case, for she made no comment, and was
  very glad of the suggestion: she was not in the mood to meet a strange woman
  that night.</p>

  <p>By the time the detective had re-examined her, the policeman had returned,
  and with him a comrade. A small crowd had gathered in front of the house,
  attracted by that instinct for tragedy which is the peculiar possession of
  crowds. By telephone Bickerson notified the murder to headquarters, and
  whilst he was waiting for the photographers and finger- print experts to
  arrive, he made a quick examination of the study.</p>

  <p>It was poorly furnished. A faded green carpet on the floor, worn knee-hole
  writing-table, two or three chairs, and a large bookcase comprised the
  principal furniture of the room. On the walls hung a few old and apparently
  valueless oil paintings, of that variety which it was the mid-Victoria
  artist's pleasure to paint. There was, too, a piece of furniture which looked
  at first like a pedestal gramophone, but which proved, on inspection, to be a
  well-stocked cellarette.</p>

  <p>On the table near the chair where the body was found was a full bottle of
  brandy, that had not been opened, and an almost empty bottle, from which, he
  guessed, Maurice Tarn had replenished his glass that night. With a tape he
  jotted down a few exact particulars. The chair on which the wretched man was
  lying was three feet from the fireplace, a foot and a half from the table
  where the bottles were resting, and nine and a half feet from the door. It
  was obvious that the murderer could not have passed between the table and his
  victim, for Bickerson had occupied that space. But there was ample room to
  pass between tile fireplace and the chair, and it was in this direction that
  the detective at first heard the noise, and an overturned chair on the other
  side of the fireplace practically located the murderer's movements to the
  satisfaction of the officer.</p>

  <p>There were no documents of any kind visible, except a few unpaid bills,
  which were on the table where the bottles stood. He began a tentative search
  of the dead man's pockets, but found nothing that could throw any light upon
  the crime.</p>

  <p>His rough search concluded, he went downstairs, past the door where Elsa
  and Ralph Hallam were talking, and out into the street. The little knot of
  people had increased in size to a fairly large crowd, and as he came out to
  the top step, casting a glance along the Crescent for a sight of the police
  car, he saw a man elbow his way through the press and advance toward the
  steps. The constable on guard stopped him, and Bickerson watched the brief
  colloquy.</p>

  <p>The stranger was a tall, spare man, slightly bent. He looked, thought
  Bickerson, a soldier; the tanned cheeks suggested that he had recently
  returned from a hotter sun than England knows; and then the identity of the
  stranger dawned upon him, and he went down the steps to speak to him.</p>

  <p>"Are you Major Amery?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That is my name," said Amery. "Tarn has been murdered, they tell me?"</p>

  <p>The detective shot a glance at him.</p>

  <p>"Who told you that?" he asked suspiciously. "Are you a friend of his?"</p>

  <p>"I am his employer," said Amery; "or rather, I was. As to the other
  question, why, I suppose everybody in the crowd knows that a murder has been
  committed. I happen to be aware that the occupant of the house is Maurice
  Tarn. There are only two people who could be murdered in that flat, and Tarn
  is the more likely."</p>

  <p>"Will you come in?" asked the detective, and showed the way into the
  passage. "Now, Major Amery," he said, "perhaps you can tell me something
  about Tarn. Had he any enemies?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing of his private life."</p>

  <p>"You were a friend of his?"</p>

  <p>Amery shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I wasn't," he said coolly; "I disliked him intensely, and trusted him
  not at all. May I see Miss Marlowe?"</p>

  <p>"How do you know Miss Marlowe is here?"</p>

  <p>The detective was glancing at him under lowered brows.</p>

  <p>"She lives here, doesn't she?" asked Amery. "Really, Mr. Bickerson
  &mdash;oh, yes, I know your name very well indeed&mdash;you have no reason to
  be suspicious of me."</p>

  <p>Bickerson thought quickly, and when he spoke again it was in a milder
  tone.</p>

  <p>"I am very naturally looking upon everybody within a radius of three miles
  as being under suspicion," he said. "I'll ask Miss Marlowe to come down to
  you, but you're not to take her away under any circumstances. You understand
  that, Major Amery? I need this lady for further information. She was in the
  room when the murder was committed: I'll go so far as to tell you what I
  would tell a reporter."</p>

  <p>Amery inclined his head gravely, and seemed in no way surprised by what
  the detective told him. He waited in the hall, staring gloomily out upon the
  morbid crowd, and presently heard a light step on the stair, and, turning,
  saw Elsa.</p>

  <p>"You've had pretty bad trouble, they tell me?"</p>

  <p>His voice was entirely without sympathy: that was the first thing that
  struck her. He was making a plain, matter-of-fact statement of an
  incontrovertible event, and she wondered why he had troubled to see her.</p>

  <p>"I happened to be in the neighbourhood," he said, "and I heard of this
  happening. I wondered if I could be of any assistance to you or to the
  police&mdash;though I admit that I know much less about Mr. Tarn than you or
  any of his acquaintances. Who is with you?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hallam," she said. "He was a great friend of poor Mr. Tarn's, and he
  is a very dear friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Hallam." He nodded. And then, with his usual unexpectedness: "Do you
  want any money?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him, astonished.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, Major Amery," she said. "It is very good of you to
  ask&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is some money due to your uncle, and if it were necessary I would
  advance your wages," he said. "You will be at the office to-morrow at the
  usual hour, if you please. It is mail day and I have a great deal of work to
  do. Good-night."</p>

  <p>She could only stare after him as he walked down the steps, utterly aghast
  at his callousness. What had mattered to him was that she should be at the
  office at her usual time. For a second a wave of anger and resentment swept
  over her, and her eyes flashed toward the disappearing figure of the
  Major.</p>

  <p>"The brute!" she murmured, and went back to the waiting Hallam.</p>

  <p>"What did he want?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"As far as I can gather, he wanted to make sure that I would be at the
  office tomorrow at my usual time, because it is mail day and he has a lot of
  work to do."</p>

  <p>"A perfect gentleman," said Ralph Hallam sardonically. "Of course, he
  sympathized with you?"</p>

  <p>"No, he didn't say a single kind word. He's just a&mdash;a brute!" Now
  that the strain had relaxed, she was on the verge of tears and wanted to be
  alone, far, far away from that grisly, sheet-covered thing in the study, from
  Ralph, from everybody who knew her. "Be at the office early!" The man had no
  heart, no human feeling. It was unthinkable that she should go to the office
  at all, and she doubted if she would ever go again. And she had done so much
  for him. She had wanted to tell him then, but had lacked the courage, just
  what she had done, how she had lied for him, how she had become almost a
  party to her uncle's murder, that he might be saved embarrassment. But he
  should know!</p>

  <p>There came the sound of many feet on the stairs. The Scotland Yard men
  were going into the room; the handle of the door turned and Bickerson
  entered.</p>

  <p>"Do you know this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>He showed her a new soft felt hat.</p>

  <p>"I found this in a corner of your uncle's study," he said. "Have you ever
  seen it before?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, my uncle never wore that kind of hat," she said. Bickerson was
  looking at the inside. It bore the name of a popular store. It was grey, with
  a black ribbon. If, as he believed was the case, this hat had been purchased
  by a Chinaman, it was not going to be very difficult to trace the owner.</p>

  <p>"You are perfectly sure that the man who came into the room, the man with
  the flash-lamp, did not speak?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "he did not speak."</p>

  <p>"And you didn't see him?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't see him."</p>

  <p>"Not even by the reflected light?" persisted the detective. "It is
  impossible to throw a ray from an electric torch upon any light surface
  without some reflected glow revealing the holder."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I saw nobody; I only saw the light, and that for a second."</p>

  <p>Why was she doing this? Why, why, why? she asked herself in despair. She
  was shielding a murderer&mdash;the murderer of Maurice Tarn. She was lying to
  save a cruel and remorseless villain from the hand of the law, and she was
  horrified at her own folly. For she knew the man in the room&mdash;had seen
  him, as the detective suggested, in the glow which had come back when the
  light had fallen upon a newspaper. And the man was Feng Ho!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap17"
     id="chap17">XVII. AT THE USUAL HOUR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ELSA spent a very sleepless night, though she occupied a
  comfortable bed in one of the quietest of the West End hotels. No sooner did
  sleep come to her eyes than the memory of that horrible night intruded itself
  upon her, and she awoke trembling, expecting to see the parchment face of
  Feng Ho leering at her in the darkness.</p>

  <p>And Feng Ho was Paul Amery. Their acts were interdependent as were their
  responsibilities. Once she got up and paced the room, striving to calm her
  mind and sort her values. She must see Mr. Bickerson and tell him the truth.
  On that point she was decided. As to Amery, she never wanted to see him
  again, never wanted to mount those narrow cooked stairs, never answer that
  shrill bell and go fluttering into his presence, like a rabbit to the
  fascinations of a snake.</p>

  <p>There was a little writing-table in her room, and, putting on the light,
  she sat down, took out a sheet of notepaper and began to write.</p><br>

  <p><small><i>"DEAR MAJOR AMERY,"</i></small> (she began),</p>

  <p class="letter">"After this terrible happening I do not feel that I can
  come back to the office again; and whilst I am very sorry if my sudden
  departure puts you to the least inconvenience, I am sure you will quite
  understand&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>He wouldn't understand at all. He would be very annoyed. That lip of his
  would lift in a sneer, and possibly he would sue her for breach of
  contract.</p>

  <p>She read the letter again, frowned and tore it up. There was no
  justification for beginning so familiarly. After all, she was not on such
  good terms that she should call him by his name. She started another letter
  <i>"Dear Sir,"</i> and sat staring at it blankly, until the church clocks
  chimed four, and a sudden sense of utter weariness made her put the light out
  and go back to bed.</p>

  <p>She was dressed at eight and had rolls and coffee in her room.</p>

  <p>Again she sat at the writing-table, playing with a pen, her mind turning
  in many directions. The quarter-past chimed, the half-past; she began another
  letter. There would be time to send it by district messenger. But the letter
  was never written. At a quarter to nine she tore up the paper, put on her hat
  and her fur and went out.</p>

  <p>At five minutes past nine, Miss Dame, waiting in her room, a newspaper
  under her arm, her brain seething with excitement, saw her come in and
  literally fell upon her.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she said, "how perfectly awful! It's in all the newspapers! I
  wonder you didn't die with fright. I should! I can't even see a murder on the
  screen..."</p>

  <p>"My dear woman," said Elsa wearily, "for heaven's sake don't talk about
  it! If you imagine that I want to discuss it... I'm not staying anyway; I've
  just come to see Major Amery, and then I'm going."</p>

  <p>"Did you faint?" demanded the seeker after sensation. "I'll bet you
  did!"</p>

  <p>And then the merciful bell above Elsa's desk rang long and imperiously.
  Before she knew what she was doing, she had slipped off her coat, hung up her
  hat, and seizing her notebook and pencil, had opened the door of the private
  office.</p>

  <p>Amery sat at his desk, his hands clasped on the edge, his stern eyes
  watching the door. He did not express any surprise, either by look or word;
  seemed, indeed, to have taken it for granted that she would be within reach
  of the bell when he pressed the button.</p>

  <p>"I'm early," he said.</p>

  <p>That was the only human speech he made, and began immediately a long
  letter to a firm of Indian merchants at Delhi. He did not give her any
  opportunity of telling him that she had only come for a few moments to
  explain why she couldn't come again. She had no time even to be annoyed at
  his assuredness. It was as much as she could do to keep pace with him. He
  never gave her a chance to question. When he came to a difficult or a native
  word, he spelt it rapidly, three times in succession, so that it was
  impossible she could miss it, or that there should be any excuse for a
  break.</p>

  <p>From the Delhi merchants he switched instantly to a letter to Bombay, but
  this time he paused midway through to hand her a slip containing a number of
  meaningless words printed in capital letters, which was to go in at the place
  he indicated.</p>

  <p>"That'll do," he said.</p>

  <p>She rose and stood waiting.</p>

  <p>"Major Amery, I want&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"Get those letters out quick. I want to catch that mail via Siberia. It
  closes in an hour."</p>

  <p>"I don't care if it closes in two minutes," she was stung to retort.
  "There is something I want to say to you, and I'm going to say it."</p>

  <p>He put down the newspaper he had taken up, folded it with exasperating
  leisure, placed it on the side of his tidy desk and put a paper-knife on top
  of it.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"My uncle was murdered last night, by a man who broke into our house
  &mdash;a man who had tried to break in before. I haven't told the police
  &mdash;I recognized him. I saw him as plainly as I see you. But I haven't
  told the police&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" His eyebrows went up, his voice was wholly unconcerned. "It is
  your duty to give the police all the information that lies in your power," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"I didn't because&mdash;because I am a fool, I suppose," she said
  wrathfully.</p>

  <p>Looking up quickly, he saw the unusually bright eyes and the flushed
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Who was he?"</p>

  <p>"Feng Ho," she blurted. "You know it was Feng Ho. You know it was, you
  know it!"</p>

  <p>He lowered his eyes to the blotting-pad, and for a little while made no
  answer. She saw the white teeth gnawing at the lower lip, and went on.</p>

  <p>"I did not want to&mdash;involve you&mdash;or your friends in this. It was
  a distorted sense of loyalty to Amery's. But I've got to tell."</p>

  <p>He looked up again.</p>

  <p>"An excellent resolution," he said. "But I think you are mistaken. Feng
  Ho&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Was with you!" She made an heroic effort to sneer, but failed
  lamentably.</p>

  <p>"If he had been with me," he said quietly, "your story would hold good,
  because I was in the neighbourhood when it happened. No, Feng Ho was many,
  many miles away from London. Believe me, he has a complete alibi."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps his hat has one too," she said tartly.</p>

  <p>He was on his feet in an instant.</p>

  <p>"His hat?"</p>

  <p>"I ought not to have told you that, I suppose," she said ruefully, "but
  the police found a hat. And a bareheaded Chinaman was seen coming away from
  the house."</p>

  <p>The ghost of a light showed in the expressionless eyes fixed upon hers,
  flickered for a second and was gone.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" he said slowly. "Well, in such a case, Feng Ho will have to
  have a double-plated alibi. That will do."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later she found a word in her notes that she could not
  decipher, and was reluctantly compelled to go back to him to secure an
  elucidation. The room was empty. Major Amery had gone out, and did not return
  for another hour, during the greater part of which time he was waiting at a
  district messenger office for the return of a boy whom he had sent to the
  Stores to purchase a soft felt hat, size 6, and it was a special instruction
  that it should be grey, with a broad black ribbon.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap18"
     id="chap18">XVIII. THE STANFORD CORPORATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DR. RALPH HALLAM spent an unusually busy day at his house in
  Half Moon Street. Ever since his partner's death he had been realizing, with
  gathering force, the immense source of embarrassment, not to say danger,
  which Maurice Tarn's death might well be. If he had only had a chance of a
  heart-to-heart talk with the dead man before a murderer's knife had cut short
  his life, he could have made sure of many developments which were now
  problematical.</p>

  <p>He waited impatiently for the hours to pass, and for darkness to come: and
  though his waiting was enlivened by at least three visits from Bickerson and
  a telephone call from his wife, the time passed all too slowly.</p>

  <p>Ralph Hallam had been reminded how precarious was his position by a letter
  which had come to him that morning from the bank, pointing out the excessive
  amount of his overdraft. Ordinarily, this would not have disturbed him, for
  there was a big accumulation of profits from the illicit business in which he
  had been engaged with Tarn. Neither man favoured banks; the money had been
  kept in dollar currency. There was nearly £200,000, of which half belonged to
  the dead man and to his heirs.</p>

  <p>His mind went immediately to Elsa Marlowe. Unless Tarn had left his money
  elsewhere, she would be as rich a woman as he was a man&mdash;if he made the
  division. That was a nice reservation, for he had not the slightest intention
  of sharing with her, and the mere possibility only entered his mind to be as
  instantly rejected. All the money that was deposited in the big green safe of
  the Stanford Corporation was his for the taking. No heir of Maurice Tarn had
  a legal right to it. He might perhaps give her a thousand or two in certain
  eventualities; but the idea of dividing this no-man's property never entered
  his head.</p>

  <p>And yet&mdash;suppose the old man had left particulars of his nefarious
  interests, and a legal claim arose? Ralph Hallam had spent his life keeping
  on the safe side, and it would be in his best interests if he made the girl
  an unconscious partner to the removal of Maurice Tarn's effects.</p>

  <p>Elsa had just returned from the office when his telephone call came
  through.</p>

  <p>"I want you to come and dine with me, Elsa. There are a few things about
  Tarn that I think you ought to know."</p>

  <p>She welcomed the diversion, for the day had been a trying one, and her
  employer had reached a point where she needed sympathy.</p>

  <p>"I will come along straight away."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Bickerson?" he asked, with a half-smile.</p>

  <p>"Seen him! He has haunted the office. And oh, Ralph, I'm so sick of it
  all, and I've got to go to the inquest&mdash;stand up and tell all the awful
  things he said to me! And did you see the evening newspapers? Ralph, they've
  published a picture of me coming out of the office for lunch!"</p>

  <p>He chuckled.</p>

  <p>"I've lived with reporters all day," he said. "Come along and we'll curse
  them together!"</p>

  <p>He put down the receiver with a thoughtful expression.</p>

  <p>That was a good move on his part. There could be no question now of his
  stealing Maurice Tarn's property. They would go together and recover the
  fortune which his industry had accrued to him.</p>

  <p>He was glad Tarn was dead&mdash;in a way. The man's nerve had failed; he
  had betrayed himself to Amery. Ralph laughed softly. Soyoka! Tarn had reached
  a condition of nervousness where he saw Soyoka at every street corner, and
  identified the mysterious head of the dope traffic in every unlikely
  individual. And yet he frowned at the thought. Who sent the Chinaman to
  Maurice Tarn's house? What object would he have had in...</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly. Soyoka would have excellent reason for smashing his
  rivals.</p>

  <p>That combination of which Ralph Hallam and Maurice Tarn were the heads had
  come into existence as the result of an accident.. Five years before, Ralph
  had found himself broke and pursued by a host of creditors, who threatened to
  bring him into the bankruptcy court. And then one night, as he and Tarn had
  sat in a fashionable West-End saloon, an acquaintance had drifted
  in&mdash;the wreck of a man, who pleaded to him for a prescription that would
  enable him to stave off the cravings of his unholy appetite. Ralph had
  scribbled the prescription, and then a word dropped by the drug victim led
  him to pursue enquiries from his borderline friends, and he had learnt of the
  existence of a powerful organization which, despite the efforts of the
  police, was engaged in what was known as the "saccharine trade." Saccharine
  was at that time the principal article smuggled; and the new and more
  sinister industry was only then beginning.</p>

  <p>Tan had unrivalled opportunities for engaging in the traffic. He was
  practically at the head of one of the oldest-established importers in the
  City of London, for the nominal chief was a sick man and seldom came to the
  office. When Hallam made the suggestion, he had shown a little hesitation,
  but after the enormous profits of the "trade" were demonstrated, he had
  fallen, and there had been founded an underworld corporation which had its
  agents in every part of the kingdom and its biggest branch in an American
  city.</p>

  <p>Ralph was a doctor, but he was also a keen business man, His title gave
  him certain privileges, and helped cover the local operations of the gang. A
  muddled success had been theirs at the start, and then, profiting by their
  mistakes and tightening their organization, the "amateurs" had come into the
  market, to the serious inconvenience of the older-established Soyoka.</p>

  <p>Soyoka! It might not have been a delusion on Tarn's part&mdash;and the
  murderous Chinaman...</p>

  <p>"Soyoka!" said Ralph Hallam aloud. "I wonder?"</p>

  <p>Elsa came half an hour later, a very tired and a very unhappy girl.</p>

  <p>"I think I shall go mad if this lasts much longer," she said. "To-morrow
  is my last day at Amery's."</p>

  <p>"Have you told him you are leaving?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I haven't had a chance to tell him anything," she said. "I don't think
  you know what he's like&mdash;he's inhuman! When you remember poor Mr. Tarn
  served the firm for over thirty years, you would imagine that Major Amery
  would be distressed. But he isn't. He had a new manager in uncle's room
  to-day! Ralph, the man is indecent! And he hasn't given me a second's peace.
  'I don't want you to take more than half an hour for luncheon,' he said. I
  wish I hadn't taken any, because those wretched newspaper photographers were
  waiting outside to snap me."</p>

  <p>"You had better cut out Amery's as soon as you can. Has he any idea you're
  leaving?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head again.</p>

  <p>"He takes me for granted," she said viciously. "I'm a part of the
  furniture. But don't let us talk about him; I want to forget the sinister
  man, I want to forget Amery's, I want to forget everything! What did you want
  to see me about? Something pleasant, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you after dinner," he said cheerfully.</p>

  <p>When his man brought the coffee and had discreetly closed the door on
  them, Ralph told her what was in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard of the Stanford Corporation?" Her eyes opened
  wide.</p>

  <p>"Yes; Major Amery asked me if I was engaged by them."</p>

  <p>Ralph whistled, "The devil he did! When was this?"</p>

  <p>She told him of the surprising question that the head of the house of
  Amery had put to her.</p>

  <p>"And of course you said you knew nothing about them? And quite
  rightly."</p>

  <p>"Did uncle know?" she asked, as the idea occurred to her.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The truth is that your uncle was running a little business of his
  own. As a matter of fact"&mdash;he spoke very reluctantly, as; though he were
  loth to betray the dead man's secret&mdash;"he was trying to build up a trade
  connection for himself in his spare time; something he could go to when Amery
  became impossible. I'm not saying that it was a strictly honourable thing to
  do, because obviously he was coming into competition with the firm that
  employed him. But be that as it may&mdash;and I tried to persuade him against
  the project, but he was so keen that I didn't like to oppose him&mdash;he
  carried out his plan."</p>

  <p>"Then he was the Stanford Corporation? What is it, Ralph?"</p>

  <p>"It is a firm of importers or something of the sort," he said carelessly.
  "I've been to the office once, and the only thing I know is this: he told me
  that in his safe there were a number of documents that he would not like to
  come to light. I've been thinking about it all day, and it seems to me that
  the best service we can render to the poor old chap is to go along and get
  those papers before the police find a clue. I don't want the old man's name
  to be soiled, and Amery is certain to paint his double-dealing in the
  blackest colours."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a troubled frown.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem a very dreadful thing to have done," she said. "Besides,
  will they know that he had anything to do with Amery's?"</p>

  <p>"It is pretty certain to come out," he said promptly. "Now the question
  is, Elsa, will you come along with me to Threadneedle Street&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But if the documents are in the safe, how can you get at them?" she
  asked, logically.</p>

  <p>For answer he took out of his pocket a small key.</p>

  <p>"Tarn and I were very good friends, in spite of the disagreement we've had
  of late, and he gave me this key, as the only man he could trust, so that, if
  anything happened to him, I should have access to the papers."</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Threadneedle Street by night is a howling wilderness, and the building in
  which the Stanford Corporation was housed was in the hands of the cleaners
  when they climbed the three flights of stairs that led to the floor where the
  secretive Mr. Tarn had operated. Half-way down a narrow corridor was a door,
  inscribed "Stanford Corporation," and this Ralph opened. She wondered whether
  it was with the same key that opened the safe, but did not ask him any
  questions.</p>

  <p>Switching on the light, he ushered her into a medium-sized room and closed
  and bolted the door behind them.</p>

  <p>"This is the sanctum sanctorum," he said.</p>

  <p>It was an unimpressive office. The floors were innocent of carpet or
  covering; one rickety table, a chair and a handsome safe in a corner of the
  room were the sole articles in view. Even the electric light that dangled
  from the ceiling was without a shade.</p>

  <p>"It's a pretty mean-looking apartment, isn't it?" said Ralph, who, thought
  the girl, had evidently been there before.</p>

  <p>He put down the bag he had brought on the table, crossed to the safe,
  inserted the key and turned it twice. The great door swung open and the girl
  saw him peer into the interior.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she heard him utter a strangled cry of wrath.</p>

  <p>"The safe is empty!" he said hoarsely. "Nothing... nothing!" She looked
  round quickly. Something was tapping on the glass panel.</p>

  <p>"Ralph"&mdash;instinctively her voice lowered&mdash;"there is somebody at
  the door."</p>

  <p>She could see the shadow against the panel&mdash;the shadow of a a
  man.</p>

  <p>For a second Ralph Hallam was so dazed by his discovery that he could not
  understand what she was saying. She seized his arm and pointed.</p>

  <p>"At the door?" he said dully. "One of the cleaners." And, raising his
  voice, he shouted angrily: "Go away!"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see you first," said a voice, and the girl nearly
  dropped.</p>

  <p>It was the voice of Paul Amery!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap19"
     id="chap19">XIX. MAJOR AMERY LOOKS IN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was Elsa who unbolted the door, and she stood back to let
  the man come in. He was wearing a dinner-jacket, and over his arm he carried
  an overcoat. He looked from the girl to Ralph, and she saw that
  half-contemptuous, half-amused twitch of lip, and hated him.</p>

  <p>"You've found your way to Stanford's, after all, Miss Marlowe?" he said.
  "And do you know that I almost believed you when you told me you had never
  heard of this enterprising establishment?"</p>

  <p>Ralph. Hallam had been taken aback for a second, and then the memory of
  Tarn's warning came to him. This man was Soyoka!</p>

  <p>"I brought Miss Marlowe here to recover some money, the property of her
  uncle," he said, looking the other straight in the eyes. "But it seems that
  I'm rather late; somebody has been here before me."</p>

  <p>The intruder glanced carelessly at the open safe, and then looked at the
  girl. Genuine astonishment was in her face.</p>

  <p>"Money?" she said. "You didn't tell me about money, Ralph!"</p>

  <p>For a second he was nonplussed.</p>

  <p>"There was money here as well as documents," he said glibly. "The point is
  that it's gone! Perhaps Major Amery will be able to tell us how it was
  taken?"</p>

  <p>"By Tarn, I should imagine," was the cool reply. "Who had a better
  right?"</p>

  <p>Again he looked at the girl and she flushed under his searching
  scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"I should keep out of this if I were you, Miss Marlowe," he said. "There
  are certain occupations that are not good for little girls."</p>

  <p>His patronage was insufferable. She trembled in her anger, and if eyes
  could have struck him down he would not have stood before her.</p>

  <p>"You know a great deal about Stanfords, Amery," said Ralph, bottling down
  his fury with a great effort. "Soyoka wouldn't be superior to a little
  burglary, I guess?"</p>

  <p>"Continue guessing," said Amery. Then, to the girl: "Now I think, Miss
  Marlowe, you had better go back to your hotel."</p>

  <p>She could contain herself no longer.</p>

  <p>"Major Amery, your dictatorial manner with me is unbearable! You have no
  right whatever to instruct me as to what I should do and what I should not
  do. Please don't call me 'little girl' again, because it annoys me beyond
  endurance. This is my uncle's office, though I was not aware of the fact
  until to-night, and I shalt be glad if you will go."</p>

  <p>With a shrug, Amery walked through the door into the corridor and in
  another instant Ralph Hallam had followed, closing the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"Now see here, Amery, we're going to have this thing right," he said. "I
  understand there isn't room in England for both of us, and I think it is fair
  to tell you that, if any crowd cracks, it will not be ours! There was money
  in that safe&mdash;a lot of money. It was there a few days ago; it's gone
  to-night. You know all about Stanfords, you've known about it for a long
  time. That means you've been able to get in and out as you liked."</p>

  <p>"In other words, I've stolen your money?"</p>

  <p>There was a look of quiet amusement in the grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'll pass one word of advice to you. It has already been offered to your
  dead confederate. Keep away from Soyoka. He's dangerous."</p>

  <p>Without another word, he turned on his heel and walked down the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>Ralph went back to the girl, livid with fury.</p>

  <p>"Has he gone?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He tried to say something, but his anger choked him.</p>

  <p>"So that's Amery, is it?" he breathed. "I'll remember the swine!"</p>

  <p>"Ralph, was there money here? You didn't tell me."</p>

  <p>"Of course there was money here!" he said impatiently. "I wanted to give
  you a surprise. There was a whole lot of money. I know it was here, because
  Tarn told me the other day."</p>

  <p>He searched the safe again, examined a few papers that were in there, and
  presently she heard him utter an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he said, concealing the sheet of pencilled writing he had taken
  from one of the two little drawers at the back of the safe. "I thought I'd
  found&mdash;something."</p>

  <p>He seemed to be in a hurry to get out of the office, almost pushed her
  into the passage before he closed the door.</p>

  <p>"Not that it is much use," he grunted; "if this fellow is who I think he
  is, a little thing like a lock is not going to stop him."</p>

  <p>"You mean Major Amery?" she said in wonder. "What did you mean, Ralph,
  about there not being room enough in England for you both? And about taking
  the money? Ralph, you don't imagine that he would have taken it, do you?"</p>

  <p>She had a confused idea that the money belonged to Amery's, had been
  stolen perhaps, and that the sinister man's interest in its existence was the
  proper interest that the robbed have in the proceeds of the robbery. Had
  Maurice Tarn been engaged in speculation on the grand scale? Her heart went
  down at the thought. If this were the case, all her vague suspicions were
  confirmed, and Mr. Tarn's behaviour was revealed in a new light.</p>

  <p>"Was it stolen... the money?" she asked jerkily. "Did Mr. Tarn...? "</p>

  <p>"For God's sake don't ask questions!"</p>

  <p>Ralph wanted to get away somewhere by himself and read the memorandum. His
  nerves were so on edge that he could not even simulate politeness.</p>

  <p>Elsa was silent all the way back to the hotel, and was glad when her
  cavalier made his excuses and left her hurriedly at the entrance. She, too,
  needed solitude and the opportunity for calm consideration.</p>

  <p>Hallam reached Half Moon Street, scarcely noticing the two men he overtook
  just before he reached his house. His key was in the lock, when a sudden
  premonition of danger made him turn quickly. The blow that was intended for
  his head just missed him, and, striking out, he floored the first of his
  opponents, but the second got under his guard, and this time he saw the flash
  of steel and felt the rip of the cloth where the point struck.</p>

  <p>"That's for Soyoka!" hissed the man as he stabbed.</p>

  <p>Hallam kicked wildly, and in the brief space of time that his advantage
  gave to him, he had jerked his automatic from his pocket. In another second
  his assailants were flying toward the Piccadilly end of the street... for a
  second his pistol was raised, and then, realizing the commotion that would
  follow a shot, he put the gun back in his pocket.</p>

  <p>Ralph Hallam came to his little study, white and shaken. Soyoka had struck
  his second blow!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap20"
     id="chap20">XX. TUPPERWILL TALKS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Early the following morning, Ralph Hallam made a call at
  Stebbing's Bank, Old Broad Street, and, after the usual mysterious
  conferences and scrutinies which invariably accompanied a call upon the
  general manager and proprietor, he saw shown into the handsome board-room
  where Mr. Tupperwill presided.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill, settling his wing collar, offered him an expansive smile,
  a large soft hand, and the Louis Quinze chair he kept for distinguished
  visitors.</p>

  <p>"I had your letter, Tupperwill, and I thought it best to come along and
  see you. I have some money coming to me&mdash;a large sum&mdash;in the course
  of the next few days, so you'll have to let my overdraft run."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill pursed his lips as though he intended whistling but had
  thought better of it.</p>

  <p>"You can have an overdraft, of course, my dear fellow, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is a but to it, then?" said Ralph, a little irritated.</p>

  <p>"There is a slight but," said the other gravely. "We run on very
  conservative lines&mdash;from <i>conservare</i>, to keep together&mdash;in
  our case to keep together our&mdash;er&mdash;assets; and when the scale goes
  down with an overdraft we like to have a little collateral on the other side
  to balance it up again. But in your case, my dear Hallam, we'll let the scale
  drop down without a balance! How much do you want?"</p>

  <p>Hallam told of his requirements, and the proprietor of Stebbing's Bank
  jotted it down on a tablet.</p>

  <p>"That's that," he said. "And now I want to ask you a question. I fact, I
  thought of ringing you up the day before yesterday, after I saw you, but I
  thought you would not want to be bothered. Who is Amery?"</p>

  <p>"Amery? You mean Paul Amery? I thought you knew him?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know him; I know also his erratic henchman. Hallam, I'm breaking all
  the rules of the bank when I tell you that he has an account with us, a
  fairly big one. He came very well recommended and"&mdash;he pulled at his
  long upper up&mdash;"I don't know what to make of him. My own inclination is
  to close his account."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Ralph in surprise.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill seemed to be struggling with himself.</p>

  <p>"With our clientele," he went on slowly, "we cannot afford to be
  associated, even remotely, with dubious projects. My directors would never
  forgive me if I allowed the bank to be used&mdash;er&mdash;for purposes which
  are outside the ordinary channels of commerce."</p>

  <p>Ralph Hallam thought of the number of times the bank had been used to
  further his own peculiar devices, and smiled inwardly.</p>

  <p>"Why are you suspicious of Amery?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm not suspicious of him," said the banker reproachfully. "Suspicability
  does not enter into the question. I merely point out that Stebbings is
  essentially a family bank. We have no commercial houses on our books, and
  there hasn't been a bill of lading in this office for fifty years."</p>

  <p>He looked round as though he were afraid that some sacrilegious
  eavesdropper might have concealed himself in that chaste apartment, and then,
  lowering his voice:</p>

  <p>"Hallam, you are a friend of mine, or I would not tell you this. Yesterday
  he deposited a very large sum of money. I am not at liberty to tell you the
  amount, but it was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ralph gasped.</p>

  <p>"Two hundred thousand pounds?" he suggested eagerly. "In American
  bills?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill stared at him.</p>

  <p>"How on earth did you know that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>His visitor drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Is that the amount?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it was very nearly that amount, and, as you so shrewdly guess, it
  was in American currency. When I say he deposited that amount, I am in error.
  What he did was to put into our safe keeping a box. I may tell you&mdash;and
  I would not tell my own wife, if I were blessed with one&mdash;that we do not
  like these, what I would call, 'secret deposits.' We have a means, which I
  will not disclose to you, of discovering their contents. There are many
  things which happen in banks of which you are not aware, but your description
  of the amount and the nature of the money is very nearly correct&mdash;very
  nearly correct. How did you come to guess?"</p>

  <p>Here Ralph was not prepared to enlighten his friend.</p>

  <p>The banker rose and began to pace the room slowly, his chubby hands behind
  him. For a time he did not speak.</p>

  <p>"You wonder why I asked you if you knew Amery, and now I'm going to
  complete my confidence, and you have the fate of the bank in your hands. I've
  been troubling about this matter ever since I made the discovery, and
  worrying myself to death as to whether I should tell you. In the box was
  something besides money. There was a large sealed envelope inscribed
  'Evidence against Hallam, to be employed on behalf of S. if necessary.' Those
  were the words&mdash;'Evidence against Hallam'&mdash;and who is 'S'? I am not
  an inquisitive man, but I would have given a lot of money, a lot of money, to
  have broken those seals."</p>

  <p>Ralph went a shade paler.</p>

  <p>"This morning he came and took the envelope away. Why, I do not know. He
  mentioned that he had taken it, quite unnecessarily. 'It will be better in my
  own study,' he said. But where did all that money come from? I don't like it,
  I don't like it at all. I like money to have a label. I like money able to
  announce the place it came from and how it was earned. That may sound curious
  to you. Two hundred thousand pounds&mdash;a million dollars, almost to a
  cent! Why doesn't he put it to his account? Why keep it locked up, earning
  nothing? Fifty thousand dollars, ten thousand pounds' worth of interest lost
  per annum! That is a crime."</p>

  <p>He shook a podgy finger at Ralph as though he were responsible.</p>

  <p>"That is not good business. And I do not like a client who isn't a good
  business man. Now, Hallam, you must tell me where that came from. You must
  know, because you mentioned the sum and the currency. Tell me."</p>

  <p>For once Ralph was not in an inventive mood. He offered some lame
  explanation, which obviously did not convince his hearer.</p>

  <p>Then, most unexpectedly, Mr. Tupperwill changed the conversation.</p>

  <p>"One of these days I should like to have a talk with your friend, Mr.
  Tarn&mdash;" he began, and Ralph stared at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you know? Haven't you read?"</p>

  <p>"Read what? I have seen nothing but this morning's financial newspapers.
  Has anything happened to him?"</p>

  <p>"He was murdered the night before last&mdash;murdered in my presence,"
  said Ralph.</p>

  <p>Tupperwill took a step backward.</p>

  <p>"Good God! You are surely not jesting?" he said.</p>

  <p>Ralph shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, he was killed the night before last&mdash;as I say, in my presence.
  It is remarkable that you should not have heard of it."</p>

  <p>On Mr. Tupperwill's boyish face was a look of almost comical concern.</p>

  <p>"Had I known, I would not have troubled you with that wretched letter, my
  dear friend." He shook his head, almost humbly. "But I never read the
  newspapers, except those devoted to my own profession, and my valet, who
  usually keeps me <i>au courant</i> with contemporary happenings, is away
  visiting his sick mother. This is terrible, terrible! Will you tell me what
  happened?"</p>

  <p>Ralph told the story in some detail, and the banker listened, without
  comment, until he had finished.</p>

  <p>"Have they any idea as to who was the man in the room?"</p>

  <p>"A very good idea. But unfortunately, the fellow we suspect, and who I'm
  pretty sure is the murderer, has proved an alibi. He was arrested late last
  night, on his return from the Midlands.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately for the police theory, he was wearing the hat which they
  expected to find he had lost, and his alibi was very complete."</p>

  <p>He did not tell how the bewildered Bickerson had put through a call to the
  Birmingham police, and from them had learnt that they were satisfied that at
  the hour the murder was committed Feng Ho was at the police station,
  registering his visit under the Aliens Act.</p>

  <p>"One Chinaman looks very much like another," he said, unconsciously
  paraphrasing Paul Amery's words; "and I imagine that the alibi was very
  carefully faked, and the person who was with the Birmingham police wasn't
  Feng Ho at all."</p>

  <p>"Feng Ho! Not Major Amery's Feng Ho?" said the other, aghast.</p>

  <p>"Do you know him? Yes, I remember you pointed him out to me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill's agitation was now complete.</p>

  <p>"I know him because he has come to the bank on one occasion with Major
  Amery, and we cashed one of Major Amery's cheques in his favour. Feng Ho!
  That is most surprising, most alarming! What of the poor young lady?"</p>

  <p>"I think she will be well provided for," said Ralph, anxious to pass that
  topic.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill seemed profoundly affected by the news of Tarn's death. He
  stood, his lips pursed, his eyes vacant.</p>

  <p>"I remember seeing a newspaper poster: that, of course, must have been the
  murder. Extraordinary!"</p>

  <p>And then he became the business man again.</p>

  <p>"So far as your overdraft is concerned, my dear Hallam, you may draw,
  without any further reference to me, to the extent of your needs. No, no, I
  will not be thanked. Having expressed the caution which my directors would
  wish me to express, I have done my duty, and will of course give my own
  personal guarantee. The inquest will be&mdash;?</p>

  <p>"To-day," said Ralph. "I am on my way now."</p>

  <p>Again the banker appeared lost in thought.</p>

  <p>"Would you object greatly if I accompanied you to this inquisition? Such
  tribunals are infinitely depressing, but... well, I have a reason."</p>

  <p>Ralph wondered what that reason might be, but in his relief that a very
  difficult financial crisis had been overcome, though the relief was tempered
  by the news he had heard, he was prepared to endure the company of his
  ponderous friend. They arrived at the little court in time to hear his name
  called.</p>

  <p>Until he was taking the oath at the witness-stand he did not see the girl,
  but when his eyes fell upon her face he guessed from her expression that she
  had already given her evidence. The proceedings held him until nearly five
  o'clock, when the inquest was adjourned. During this time it was impossible
  to get near her, and not until they were outside the court did he have a
  chance of speaking.</p>

  <p>"I was rather a bear last night, Elsa, and I want you to forgive me. But
  my nerves were on edge."</p>

  <p>"Mine were too," she said, and saw Mr. Tupperwill hovering in the
  background.</p>

  <p>"I want you to meet my friend Mr. Theophilus Tupperwill," he said,
  introducing the stout man. "This is Miss Marlowe."</p>

  <p>The banker took the girl's hand in his, his countenance bearing that
  expression of melancholic sympathy for which the occasion called.</p>

  <p>"I knew your poor uncle," he said in a hushed voice. "I will say no more.
  'Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours, makes the night morning and the
  noontide night'&mdash;Shakespeare."</p>

  <p>And with the delivery of that profound sentiment he took his farewell.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Tupperwill: he's the head of Stebbing's Bank and a good fellow," said
  Ralph. He had never suspected the banker of sentiment. "Are you going to
  Lou's to-night?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I can't go to-night; I have to go back to the office."</p>

  <p>He looked at her in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to tell me that Amery expects you back there to-night?" he
  said incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Not only expects, but demands," she said, with a tightening of her lips.
  "I am resigning on Saturday: I left him a note telling him so. He has given
  me no consideration whatever. But please don't talk about him. You can drive
  me a part of the way, can't you?"</p>

  <p>"All the way," said Ralph indignantly.</p>

  <p>His indignation was largely assumed. He did not expect any consideration
  for man, woman or child from Soyoka's representative, and it would have been
  inconsistent with his mind picture of the man if Amery had shown the
  slightest evidence of humanity.</p>

  <p>She thought he was a little distrait on the journey to the City and put it
  down to the natural reaction from the inquest. In truth Ralph Hallam's mind
  was considerably occupied by the knowledge that, somewhere in Amery's study
  was a heavily sealed envelope ominously inscribed, His mind went back to the
  letter that Tarn had received on the morning of his death. The offer of
  £100,000 was considerable, if Soyoka knew where he could lay his hand on
  twice that amount of money, and probably had already extracted the bills from
  the safe.</p>

  <p>At her request, he left the girl at the end of Wood Street, and, in spite
  of her wrath at her employer, she hurried back to her office in a flutter,
  and was quite ready, when she saw him, to excuse herself for being late.</p>

  <p>He was waiting in his room, standing with his back to the fireless grate,
  his hands clasped behind him, staring moodily at the floor. On his desk she
  saw, open, the letter she had left for him, and such was the power he
  exercised over her that she felt a little spasm of unease at the prospect of
  the reception which he would give to her resignation. The first words he
  spoke were on that matter.</p>

  <p>"So you're leaving us, Miss Marlowe?" he said. "You have saved me the
  trouble of dismissing you."</p>

  <p>At this, all her fears fled.</p>

  <p>"You might at least have had the decency to spare me that offence," she
  retorted hotly. "I am leaving you for no other reason than that it is
  impossible for any self-respecting girl to work with you; because your
  manners are deplorable, and your attitude to women, so far as I am able to
  judge from my own experience, is so unmannerly and boorish that it is
  degrading to be at your beck and call!"</p>

  <p>He was staring at her as she spoke, and she thought she saw in his eyes a
  look of astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" was all he said. And then: "You told me you knew nothing of
  Stanfords?"</p>

  <p>"And neither did I," she said angrily. "Twice by inference you have called
  me a liar, and I hope that you will not repeat your insult."</p>

  <p>He was taken aback by her vehemence, and before he could speak she
  continued:</p>

  <p>"I went to Mr. Tarn's office without being aware that the Stanford
  Corporation had any existence except in your imagination. I haven't the
  slightest idea of the business my uncle was conducting, but I suppose, from
  your attitude, that it was an improper one. As to how he got his money, and
  how much money he had, I am equally ignorant. I had no idea that there was
  money at all there. Dr. Hallam told me there were documents&mdash;it was your
  money, of course? My uncle stole it&mdash;is that the mystery?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"No, your uncle stole no money from Amery's," he said, to her amazement.
  "So far as I know, he was a trustworthy man&mdash;where the firm's money was
  concerned."</p>

  <p>He licked his lips. He had gone back to a contemplation of the blue
  carpet.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said, though there was no quality of sorrow in his tone.
  "I seem to have fallen into an error, Of course you knew nothing about
  Stanfords. He wouldn't have told you."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tarn never discussed his business affairs with me."</p>

  <p>"I'm not thinking of Mr. Tarn," he said deliberately. "I am thinking of
  the excellent Dr. Hallam, who, unless I am greatly mistaken, is scheduled for
  a very troublous time."</p>

  <p>Another long interregnum of silence, during which a little of her old
  discomfort had returned, and then:</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. I withdraw the statement that I intended discharging you,
  although I did. If you wish to stay on in this post you may."</p>

  <p>"I have no such wish," she said briefly, and, sitting down at the desk,
  opened her notebook.</p>

  <p>Still he made no move.</p>

  <p>"A chubby man," he said, apropos of nothing, "and a lover of good things.
  His boast of abstemiousness is part of his vanity. The cracker and milk come
  at eleven, but he lunches royally at two."</p>

  <p>She was gazing, stupefied.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tupperwill," he said, and explained, "I was at the inquest. You would
  not think Hallam could make friends with a man like that? But Hallam has
  unsuspected charms."</p>

  <p>Was he being sarcastic? She gave him no excuse for discussing Ralph, and
  waited patiently, her pencil poised.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ho thinks you are wonderful." He broke the silence with this
  gratuitous remark, and she flushed.</p>

  <p>"His good opinion of me is not reciprocated," she said tartly, "and
  really, Major Amery, I am not interested in Feng Ho's views about me. Do you
  wish to dictate any letters? I should like to home as early as possible: I
  have a headache."</p>

  <p>She saw his lip curl.</p>

  <p>"You think I have been a brute, eh? Keeping your nose to the grindstone?
  But I'll tell you something, young lady. I haven't given you time to think! I
  have invented work for you, to keep your mind off a certain dark room in
  Elgin Crescent, where Tarn got what was coming to him for a long time. He had
  been warned."</p>

  <p>"By you?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"By me and by others."</p>

  <p>And then, with an effort, he tore himself from his thoughts, which were
  obviously unpleasant, and began, without preliminary, the dictation of what
  promised to be an interminable letter. This, however, it was not. Halfway
  through he stopped as suddenly as he had begun.</p>

  <p>"I think that will do for to-night," he said. "You need not make the
  transcript until to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>He followed her into the outer office, his coat on his arm, his hat and
  cane in his hand.</p>

  <p>"You are at the Palace Hotel, aren't you? I may want you to come to my
  house to-night."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I have an engagement to-night," she answered coldly.</p>

  <p>At that moment the door opened and Jessie Dame came in. She was incoherent
  in her embarrassment at the sight of the forbidding face, and would have
  withdrawn.</p>

  <p>"Miss Dame! I may want some work done to-night, in which case I would like
  you to accompany Miss Marlowe to my house&mdash;304, Brook Street. Will you
  keep in touch with her?"</p>

  <p>Elsa opened her lips to protest, but before she could speak he was gone,
  with no more acknowledgment of her presence than if she had been the desk
  against which she leant, stricken dumb with anger.</p>

  <p>"I'll not go, I'll not go! I told him I was engaged, and I refuse to go to
  his house."</p>

  <p>Miss Dame glared sympathetically. But at the same time&mdash;"I'd rather
  like to see his house," she said. "I'll bet it's full of trap-doors and
  secret panels. Have you ever seen 'Sold for Gold'? Amery does remind me of
  the husband! He used to keep his real wife tied up in a cellar, and pretended
  he was single. And then, when he was leading the other girl to the altar, a
  strange figure appeared at the vestry door, heavily veiled, you
  understand&mdash;and, mind you, he still thought she was in the
  cellar&mdash;and just as the parson was going to say 'Who will take this
  woman to be his wedded wife?' up she springs, takes off her veil and it's
  her!"</p>

  <p>"Who?" asked the bewildered Elsa, interested in spite of herself.</p>

  <p>"The wife&mdash;the real wife!" said Miss Dame triumphantly. "The one that
  was in the cellar. She got out owing to the butler, who'd been stealing money
  from the man, leaving the door open."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I'm not going to his house," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"There'll be Indian servants there perhaps," said Miss Dame hopefully.
  "Dark, noiseless men in spotless white. He claps his hands and they appear as
  if by magic from secret doors. And idols too! And incense&mdash;incense comes
  from India, doesn't Miss Marlowe? I'd like to see that house." She shook her
  head sadly. "I'd go if I were you, Miss Marlowe."</p>

  <p>"I'll not do anything of the sort," said Elsa, banging down the cover of
  her typewriter viciously.</p>

  <p>"I'll be in the same room with you," encouraged Miss Dame. "There's always
  trap-doors in those kind of houses. Do you remember 'The Rajah's Bride'?
  Ethel Exquisite was in it&mdash;I don't think that's her real name, do you?
  What's your telephone number?"</p>

  <p>"You needn't bother to call me, because, if he sends for me, I shall not
  take the slightest notice."</p>

  <p>"304, Brook Street," mused Miss Dame. "A House of Mystery!"</p>

  <p>Elsa laughed in spite of herself. "Don't be absurd. It's a very ordinary
  West End house. I've passed it heaps of times, and I went there once, when
  the old Mr Amery was alive."</p>

  <p>"He has probably transformed it to suit his Eastern ideas," said Miss
  Dame, loth to relinquish the picture she had formed. "There'll be carpets
  that your feet sink into, and divvans&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Divans?" suggested Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Is that how you pronounce it?" asked Miss Dame in surprise. "Dy-van?
  Well, there'll be those. And joss-sticks, and music. I know these kind of
  people. Lord! I'd like to see it."</p>

  <p>Elsa saw her wistful eyes and was as much amused as she could be.</p>

  <p>"One would almost think you were in league with him," she said
  good-humouredly. "And now you can walk with me to the hotel, for fear I'm
  kidnapped in the streets of London and carried off to Major Amery's secret
  harem."</p>

  <p>"Even that has been done," said Miss Dame cheerfully.</p>

  <p>It was not a pleasant evening for Elsa. She had scarcely arrived at the
  hotel before the girl rang her up and asked her whether she had changed her
  mind. At intervals of half an hour she heard the anxious voice of the seeker
  after romance.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, Jessie," she said sharply. This was after the fifth time;
  she had had her dinner and gone to her room. "He hasn't sent for me; and if
  he sends, I shall not go."</p>

  <p>"I shall call you up every half-hour till half past eleven," said the
  determined female at the other end of the wire. "You can trust me, Miss
  Marlowe."</p>

  <p>Elsa groaned and hung up the receiver,</p>

  <p>It was a few minutes before eleven when the telephone rang, and, thinking
  it was Jessie Dame, Elsa was in two minds about answering the call. When she
  did so, the voice that greeted her was Amery's.</p>

  <p>"Is that Miss Marlowe? Major Amery speaking. Get a cab and come round to
  my house, please. I have sent my housekeeper to fetch Miss Dame."</p>

  <p>"But, Major Amery, I am going to bed&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>Click!</i> The receiver was hung up.</p>

  <p>Here was her opportunity for asserting her independence. She had been a
  feeble, weak-kneed creature, deserving the contempt of every self-respecting
  woman. He should not order her about as though she were a slave. She would
  show him that he could not force her will.</p>

  <p>She sat determinedly on the bed, her eyes fixed on the telephone bell, and
  when it rang, as it did after a quarter of an hour's interval, she
  jumped.</p>

  <p>"Is that Miss Marlowe?" The voice was impatient, almost angry. "I am still
  waiting for you. Miss Dame has already arrived."</p>

  <p>Elsa sighed wearily.</p>

  <p>"I'll come," she said.</p>

  <p>She tried to persuade herself that it was only because she could not leave
  Jessie Dame in what that imaginative lady had described as "The House of
  Mystery" that she was going, and because she was humouring the gaunt girl in
  her desire for sensation. But she knew in her heart that she was yielding to
  the domination which the sinister man had established, and she hated him more
  than ever.</p>

  <p>A very prosaic butler opened the door to her, and a little, middle-aged
  woman, eminently respectable, took her up into the drawing-room, where she
  found Jessie Dame sitting on the edge of a chair, her lips tightly pressed
  together, her magnified eyes looking disapprovingly upon the extremely
  Western character of the room.</p>

  <p>It was very large and a little old-fashioned, with its cut-glass
  chandelier converted for the use of electric current, its high-backed
  Chippendale chairs and ancient cabinets. The carpet, tortured with floral
  designs, scrolls and coarse-skinned Cupids, was distinctly Victorian. Elsa
  could well understand Miss Dame's disappointment.</p>

  <p>The sinister man was nowhere in sight, and they were left alone
  together.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen him?" hissed Miss Dame.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"He's nothing much to look at," deprecated Miss Dame, "but there's a
  Chinese servant here. You've got to be careful!"</p>

  <p>She put her finger to her lips as the door opened and Amery came in. He
  was in evening dress, and, from the scowl that puckered his forehead, she
  guessed that he was in his usual mood.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect to send for you to-night," he said brusquely, "but
  something has happened which has given a very serious aspect to my little
  joke."</p>

  <p>His little joke! She gasped. Was that his idea of humour to suggest he
  might send for her at any moment? Apparently it was, for he went on: "I am
  relying upon you girls to treat this matter as strictly confidential. You
  will hear things to-night which certain people would be very glad to know,
  and which they would pay a large sum of money to learn."</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands twice, and Miss Dame's eyes glistened eagerly as a
  door at the end of the room opened and a Chinaman came in. It was not Feng
  Ho, but a little man in a blue silk coat and a sort of white petticoat He
  stood with his hands concealed in his sleeves, his head bowed respectfully,
  and there was a rapid exchange of question and answer in some hissing
  language, which the girls guessed was Chinese. When they had finished:</p>

  <p>"Will you come this way?" said Amery, and walked toward the open door.</p>

  <p>The Chinaman had disappeared, and, after a second's hesitation, conscious
  that Miss Dame's hand was clutching her arm with a bruising tightness, Elsa
  followed the head of the house of Amery into a smaller room, from which
  opened three doors. Amery turned the handle of the first of these, opened the
  door and stepped in, holding up his arm to warn them to remain. Presently his
  face reappeared round the edge of the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in, please," he said, and Elsa, with a wildly beating heart, walked
  into the well-lit room.</p>

  <p>To all appearance a servant's bedroom, its dimensions were limited, and
  the furniture consisted of a bed, a strip of carpet and a wardrobe. On the
  bed lay a man, and at the sight of him the girl was speechless with
  amazement.</p>

  <p>His face white as death, his head and one hand heavily bandaged, the
  stricken man greeted her with a cheerful smile.</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Meet Mr. Theophilus Tupperwill, the eminent banker," said Amery.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap21"
     id="chap21">XXI. THE SIGNED STATEMENT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. TUPPERWILL greeted the girl with a pathetic smile.</p>

  <p>"We have met under happier circumstances," he said. "This is the young
  lady who&mdash;?</p>

  <p>"We will take your statement," interrupted Amery characteristically, and
  turned to the girl. "Our friend has had a very unpleasant turn, and is
  anxious&mdash;or rather, I am anxious&mdash;to see his experience recorded in
  black and white."</p>

  <p>"Very business-like," murmured Mr. Tupperwill.</p>

  <p>"And signed," added Amery, and the girl noted the extra emphasis he gave
  to the word.</p>

  <p>The sinister man was touching the bandage on the man's head, and she saw
  Tupperwill wince.</p>

  <p>"Not bad for an amateur," he said, with a pride which was almost human.
  "Now, Mr. Tupperwill. Have you brought your book, by the way?"</p>

  <p>Elsa nodded. What was the meaning of this strange scene? Out of the corner
  of her eye she could see that Jessie Dame was quivering with excitement. At
  last this lover of the sensational had been brought into actual touch with a
  happening out of the ordinary.</p>

  <p>Amery went out and returned with a chair, which he planted down with
  unnecessary noise near the wounded man's bed.</p>

  <p>"Now, Miss Marlowe," he said curtly.</p>

  <p>The banker turned his head with a grin of pain.</p>

  <p>"Very business-like," he murmured again. "You would like me to make this
  statement? Now where shall I begin?"</p>

  <p>She thought, from the position of his lips, that he was trying to whistle,
  but Amery, who knew him better, guessed the meaning of the grimace.</p>

  <p>"I think I had better start with my dinner," said Mr. Tupperwill slowly.
  "I dined at home&mdash;a devilled sole, a little chicken grandmère, and a
  soufflé&mdash;I don't think there was anything else&mdash;oh, yes, an entrée,
  but the composition of the dinner has nothing to do with the matter. I had my
  coffee and then, at a quarter past ten, I took my evening stroll, three times
  round the block&mdash;an exercise which is necessary to me, for I am a poor
  sleeper. Usually I take my little dog for a walk, but this evening poor
  little Tamer was suffering from injuries inflicted by a large, undisciplined
  dog that he met in the park, and I walked alone. I did not in consequence
  deviate from my usual route, but went my customary round passing along Brook
  Street to Park Lane, and returning by the same route.</p>

  <p>"I was half-way along the street, which at that time of night is a very
  quiet thoroughfare, when I saw a car drive up to the kerb and two men alight.
  A third man now appeared upon the scene, and suddenly, to my horror and
  amazement, all three began to fight! Though not of a pugnacious nature, I
  made my way quickly to the spot, with the idea of inducing them to desist. It
  was, in all the circumstances, a very hazardous decision for a man who is not
  especially athletic, and I have very good reason for regretting my action. I
  saw that the two assailants were powerfully built men. The third, whom they
  were attacking, I could not see, because they had wrapped his head in a cloth
  of some description, though he was still struggling violently. No sooner did
  I appear on the scene than somebody struck me, and I lost consciousness, and
  did not wake until I found myself in the hands of Major Amery and a passing
  pedestrian, who kindly assisted the Major to bring me into his house, at the
  door of which I had been attacked."</p>

  <p>"You have forgotten the letter," said Amery drily.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, oh yes! All my ideas are at sixes and sevens. Please put in your
  statement that after dinner my footman brought me a letter, which he said he
  had found in the letter-box. I opened it and discovered a sheet of paper with
  four words&mdash;'You talk too much.' Those were the words: the original may
  be seen. Exactly what they mean, and to what act of loquacity they refer, I
  cannot guess. I am habitually and by nature a&mdash;a person extremely
  reserved. That I could talk too much in any circumstances, is unthinkable.
  Now, are there any questions you would like to ask me, Major?"</p>

  <p>"The car was gone, of course, when you were found?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and the man also&mdash;you saw nothing of them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw them," said the other carelessly. "At least, I saw a car. Have
  you got that, Miss Marlowe?"</p>

  <p>Elsa nodded.</p>

  <p>"You will find a small typewriter in my study. Mrs. Elinan will show you
  the way. I would like that statement typed and signed."</p>

  <p>She went out with Jessie Dame, the latter so thrilled that her voice was a
  squeaky twitter of sound.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of that?" she asked, when they were alone together in
  the plain little study to which the housekeeper had taken them. "Have you
  ever heard anything like it? Doesn't that beat the pictures? As I always say,
  there's more villainy happens in real life than people know&mdash;who do you
  think it was, Miss Marlowe?"</p>

  <p>Elsa was sitting before the typewriter, her mind in a turmoil. "I don't
  know whether Major Amery has a grudge against this man," she said slowly,
  "but I have heard and read about these sham street fights, which are intended
  to bring innocent people within reach."</p>

  <p>Miss Dame gasped, and flopped down on a sofa, which was the nearest to a
  "divvan" she had seen.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that the sinister man got up this quarrel to catch Mr.
  Tupperwill?"</p>

  <p>Elsa shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to think," she said.</p>

  <p>For some reason she did not wish to discuss Amery with the girl, but as
  she recalled Amery's callous indifference and his eagerness to have a signed
  statement which obviously would exculpate himself, her suspicions grew.</p>

  <p>Why did he not go to the police? It was unthinkable that he should have
  any quarrel with Tupperwill. There seemed no grounds, except that he was a
  friend of Ralph. But if that were the case, and Tupperwill could be regarded
  as an enemy who had 'talked too much,' how easy it would be to engineer that
  scene in Brook Street! He must have known something of Tupperwill's habits.
  Probably at the same hour every night the stout man took his constitutional
  along Brook Street. A creature of habit, playing into the hands of these
  men.</p>

  <p>She shivered. It did not bear thinking about.</p>

  <p>Searching the table where the typewriter stood for a sheet of blank paper,
  she saw there was none suitable, and did not like to open any of the drawer.
  Then, glancing quickly round the room,. her eyes rested on a small cupboard
  of unpainted pine. It was evidently a new fixture. Miss Dame intercepted the
  look.</p>

  <p>"Do you want paper, dear?" she asked, and half rose. But Elsa was already
  on her feet.</p>

  <p>"It may be here," she said.</p>

  <p>The door of the cupboard was ajar. She pulled it open and found, as she
  had expected, a number of shelves with library requirements. She found
  something else: a short length of material which she recognised as rhinoceros
  hide and which the South Africans call 'sjambok.' Mr. Tarn had had a
  walking-stick made of the skin. In length it was about twenty inches, and was
  almost as thick as her wrist. She would not have noticed it, but for the fact
  that it lay upon a package of paper which was sprinkled with some dark stain.
  She opened the cupboard wider. The stain was blood, and, repressing her
  desire to announce her find, she picked up the thing gingerly and brought it
  to the light. And then she saw that the end was red and still wet!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap22"
     id="chap22">XXII. THE TRUTH ABOUT TARN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE mystery of Mr. Tupperwill's injury was a mystery no
  longer. This was the weapon that had been used, and the hand that had struck
  him down was the hand of Paul Amery. He must have come straight into the
  study, which was the first room off the hall, thrown the stick into the
  cupboard and forgotten about it, and then gone out to pretend he was
  assisting the unfortunate banker. Probably the presence of that pedestrian
  saved Tupperwill's life. She shuddered, and, clutching at the package of
  paper, came back to the table.</p>

  <p>"Why, Miss Marlowe, what is the matter?"</p>

  <p>Jessie Dame stared in stupefaction at the change in the girl's colour.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I'm a little upset perhaps," said Elsa unsteadily.</p>

  <p>She tore open the package, fixed a sheet in the machine, and, biting her
  lip, concentrated upon the statement. While she typed, the hideous thing
  became more clear. Her theory was substantiated.</p>

  <p>She had just finished when Amery came into the room. He took the paper
  from her hand, corrected two typing mistakes, and went out of the room
  again.</p>

  <p>"One of you girls come," he said; "I want a witness."</p>

  <p>Jessie Dame followed him before she realized that she was unattended. She
  came fluttering back a few minutes later with the announcement that she had
  "witnessed the deed," and that Mr. Tupperwill was sitting up and had
  expressed his intention of going home.</p>

  <p>"And I'm certain as certain can be," said Miss Dame dramatically, "that
  your theory as to how the murder was committed is true. When I say 'murder,'
  I mean it might have been murder. They were waiting for this poor dear
  man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jessie Dame, you are to forget what I have said."</p>

  <p>Elsa was surprising herself by her fatuous defence of the man.</p>

  <p>"It is much more probable that Mr. Tupperwill's theory is correct: that
  the two were strangers, they were attacking a third person, and that,
  thinking he was interfering, they struck him down."</p>

  <p>Through the open door she heard footsteps in the passage, and presently
  Mr. Tupperwill, looking very wan and limp, came in.</p>

  <p>"A little brandy, I think, will do you a whole lot of good," said Amery.
  He opened a cellarette and poured out a small brown potion.</p>

  <p>"Brandy... yes, thank you," muttered the banker. "There is one other
  statement I should like to have made. I ought to have described the man they
  were taking away, but I forgot that part."</p>

  <p>"You didn't see his face, I understand?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't see his face. As far as I could tell, he was a shortish man,
  dressed in a yellowish kind of tweed. The trousers," said Mr. Tupperwill
  soberly, "I could swear to."</p>

  <p>"I am seeing Mr. Tupperwill home." Amery was addressing the girl. "I don't
  think I have any further need for you to-night. Thank you for coming."</p>

  <p>It was on the tip of Elsa's tongue to retort that she hoped her wasted
  evening would count as overtime, but so many things came to the tip of her
  tongue and went no further in the presence of this forbidding man.</p>

  <p>She got rid of Jessie Dame as quickly as she could, and, going straight to
  the hotel, called up Ralph and told him what had happened.</p>

  <p>"You're not in bed yet?" said Ralph quickly. "I mean, can I see you if I
  come round?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," she said in surprise, "but I can see you in the morning."</p>

  <p>"No, I must see you to-night. I can't talk over the 'phone. Will you be
  waiting for me in the vestibule?"</p>

  <p>She looked at the watch on her wrist: it was then half-past eleven.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'll risk my reputation. Come along," she said.</p>

  <p>He was with her in a remarkably short space of time, and learnt in detail
  the story of Tupperwill's alarming experience. Elsa had thrown discretion to
  the wind. She felt that in this case at any rate, she need show no reluctance
  in relating her employer's business. When she had finished, Ralph was looking
  at her strangely.</p>

  <p>"So that is it! He talks too much! The devil must have learnt what
  Tupperwill told me this morning, though how on earth they overheard beats me.
  First Tarn, then the money, and now Tupperwill. Soyoka stops at nothing."</p>

  <p>"Soyoka? Why, that's the drug man, isn't it? Oh, Ralph!" At that moment
  was revealed in a flash the mystery that had so puzzled her.</p>

  <p>"Soyoka! The drug gangs! There are two&mdash;one Soyoka, the other
  &mdash;not Mr. Tarn!" she breathed.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"You've got to know sooner or later."</p>

  <p>"And you?" she asked, in a voice scarcely above a whisper.</p>

  <p>"And me also," he said coolly. "There's no sense in being shocked, Elsa.
  It is a commercial proposition. You wouldn't object to meeting a distiller or
  a brewer, just because a few fellows couldn't hold liquor and behave like
  gentlemen?"</p>

  <p>"Soyoka!" she said again. "Major Amery?"</p>

  <p>"He's either Soyoka or his big man."</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Tupperwill?"</p>

  <p>"He's nothing," said Ralph impatiently. "Tupperwill is just my banker, and
  he happens also to be Amery's banker. He told me that he didn't like the
  account on his books&mdash;that was one of the things he said. Amery has come
  to know, and to-night the gang went out to teach Tupperwill a lesson. And I
  can prove it," he said. "To-morrow Amery will close his account at Stebbing's
  Bank, and bring away all his deed-boxes. By gad! If I knew!"</p>

  <p>His eyes were bright, his voice quivered with excitement. As for the girl,
  she felt physically sick at the revelation.</p>

  <p>"It is too dreadful, too dreadful!" she said in a low voice. "I can't
  believe that men could be such brutes! Was that money, Ralph&mdash;the money
  that"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"uncle earned, and you..."</p>

  <p>Her look of hardly concealed disgust irritated him.</p>

  <p>"That's not the way to look at it," he said. "I tell you that it's just a
  commercial proposition. Against the law, perhaps, but then, many things are.
  It is no worse than rum-running, and I know of some decent people who are
  making money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not decent, surely!" she said, with a sudden revival of her old self.</p>

  <p>She rose.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to think this over," she said, and went up to her room, her
  mind all ways.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap23"
     id="chap23">XXIII. PERFECTLY HORRIBLE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ONE very definite conclusion she reached, when she was
  putting on her shoes preparatory to going to that hateful office: her
  connection with Amery's was practically finished. Why she did not proclaim
  the man's infamy from the housetops puzzled her. Was her moral code so loose
  that she could condone one crime at least of which she had proof, and another
  which she now suspected?</p>

  <p>How would he appear to her now, she wondered, now that she knew him for
  what he was, a man who was living by debasing humanity, a cruel, brutal thug,
  who could strike down an unoffending man because he had dared break some rule
  of the bank?</p>

  <p>Her way eastward led her past the great newspaper offices, and, obeying an
  impulse, she turned into the publisher's department, and began a search of
  the files. Presently she found the paragraph she had read to her uncle that
  morning, and which (now she well understood why) had thrown him into such a
  state of agitation.</p>

  <p>A stray reporter who drifted in, <i>en route</i> to the cashier's desk,
  saw a pretty girl turning the pages, and, noticing that she was not scanning
  the advertisement columns, sidled up to her.</p>

  <p>"Can I help you?" he asked. "I'm on the staff of the paper."</p>

  <p>Her first inclination was to decline his assistance. But she had recalled
  something Major Amery had said, and she was debating whether it would be too
  long a job to find the news she wanted, when he appeared on the scene.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to find an account of the holding up of the Chinese
  train."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the Blue Train outrage? You won't find it on that file. It happened
  months ago," he said.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember why it was held up?"</p>

  <p>The youthful reporter smiled.</p>

  <p>"To get a little easy money, I guess," he said. "There were one or two
  wealthy opium smugglers on the train."</p>

  <p>Opium again! She drew a long sigh.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very, very much," she said, and hurried out, to the
  disappointment of the young connoisseur of feminine elegance.</p>

  <p>It was curious, she thought, when the bell called her to his presence,
  that Amery did not look any different. She thought that, in the light of her
  knowledge and a keener scrutiny, she would detect some evidence of his
  callousness. There must be that in his face which would betray his evil mind.
  But no: he was just what he had always been, and for his part, neither his
  manner nor his tone revealed the slightest difference in his attitude towards
  her, except that for once he was gracious.</p>

  <p>"I am much obliged to you for coming to me last night," he said. "You will
  be delighted to learn that Mr. Tupperwill passed an excellent night, and the
  doctor thinks that he will be able to go to business in a few days."</p>

  <p>Was there an undercurrent of mockery in his tone? She thought there was,
  and could only marvel at his cool brutality.</p>

  <p>"And what comfort had Dr. Hallam to offer to you?" he went on
  immediately.</p>

  <p>"You watch me rather closely, Major Amery," she said quietly. "I did not
  ask the doctor to come to comfort me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you <i>did</i> ask him to come, did you? I thought you might have
  done," he said. "Was he impressed by the news of Tupperwill's sad fate? I see
  that you don't feel inclined to discuss the matter. We'll get on with the
  letters."</p>

  <p>The matter was still in his mind at the end of half an hour's dictation,
  for he asked:</p>

  <p>"Was there anything you did not tell him about last night's
  happenings?"</p>

  <p>Quick as a flash came the reply:</p>

  <p>"I did not tell of the blood-stained sjambok I found in the paper
  cupboard."</p>

  <p>She could have bitten her tongue. The sentence was half out before she
  tried to stop herself, but it was too late. Not a muscle of his face moved;
  the grave eyes did not so much as blink.</p>

  <p>"I wondered where you'd found the paper, and hoped I had left some on the
  desk. I suppose you think I am a pretty tough case?"</p>

  <p>"I think you're perfectly horrible," she said. "May I go now?"</p>

  <p>"You think I'm perfectly horrible, do you? And so do others, and so will
  others," he said. "As for Tupperwill, he should have been a little more
  discreet."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she gasped. "Then you admit it!"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"The lesson will not be lost on him," he said.</p>

  <p>She hardly knew whether she was asleep or awake when she got back to her
  typewriter, and was absurdly grateful for the unmusical click and crash of
  the keys, which brought her back to the mental position of a rational
  being.</p>

  <p>She hoped, as she banged savagely at the keys, that Major Amery's new
  secretary would have sufficient spirit to shake his self-conceit. She prayed
  that the unfortunate female (no man would endure him for a week) would break
  every one of his rules&mdash;open his letters and unfasten the strings of his
  parcels; two of his eccentricities being that he would allow no one to open
  either except himself. She pictured a steely-faced Gorgon with a heart of
  stone, who would freeze him to humbleness. As Major Amery had the choosing of
  his own secretaries, she reflected ruefully, he would probably find some
  wretched, broken-spirited girl who would accept his insolence as a normal
  condition of her employment.</p>

  <p>She was engaged in inventing a special type of secretary when the bell
  rang sharply and she flew in to the tyrant.</p>

  <p>"I forgot a letter when you were in here before," he said. "Take
  this:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"To the Managing Director, Stebbing's Bank.</p>

  <p class="letter">"SIR,</p>

  <p class="letter">"I am this day closing my account with Stebbing's Bank, and
  have to request that my balance be transferred to my credit at the Northern
  &amp; Midland. And this further authorizes you to hand to the bearer the
  steel box held by the bank in my name. The receipt of the bearer, Mr. Feng
  Ho, B.Sc., should be accepted as mine.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Yours faithfully."</p><br>

  <p>She went back to her machine, finally convinced that all that Ralph had
  prophesied had come true. Amery was closing his account at the Stebbing
  Bank.</p>

  <p>Paul Amery was the subject of another discussion between two men, one of
  whom had reason to hate and the other to suspect him. Mr. Tupperwill lay in
  the centre of his large bed, a picturesque figure; one white-clad hand
  gripped a golden bottle of smelling salts, for his head ached vilely.
  Nevertheless, he had not been unwilling to receive Ralph Hallam and to give
  him a first-hand account of his misfortune. And Ralph had been most
  sympathetic and enquiring. But at the very suggestion that his assailant was
  none other than Paul Amery himself, Mr. Tupperwill had been as indignant as
  if his own <i>bona fides</i> had been attacked.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, my dear man, nonsense!" he said, as sharply as his throbbing
  head would permit. "Amery was nowhere near the place. I distinctly saw the
  men who attacked me. There may have been a third person, but I very much
  doubt it. There was not even a chauffeur on the box of the car. Why on earth
  should Amery attack me?"</p>

  <p>There was excellent reason, thought Ralph, but this did not seem the
  moment to make a disclosure.</p>

  <p>"It struck me as possible," he said. "Amery is a wildish kind of
  fellow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rubbish! Stuff! Excuse the violence of my language, my dear Hallam, but
  it is too fantastic to discuss the two wretched assassins&mdash;which, by the
  way, comes from the word Hassan, the old man of the mountains who first
  employed murderers to settle his private feuds. Neither of these two was
  Amery, I'll swear."</p>

  <p>Very wisely, Ralph did not press the point.</p>

  <p>"At the same time," Mr. Tupperwill went on, "I confess that I do not like
  Major Amery as a client, and I shall seize the very earliest opportunity of
  getting rid of his account."</p>

  <p>"I think he'll save you the trouble," said Ralph drily.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Mr. Tupperwill's eyes opened wide.</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;well, because&mdash;" Ralph picked up the letter that Mr.
  Tupperwill had shown him, read the four words and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Do you connect this warning with the piece of information you gave me
  yesterday morning?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"About Amery? Good heavens, no!"</p>

  <p>"It is the same kind of letter-paper, the same kind of writing, that poor
  Tarn received before his death. Evidently written by the same man. And to
  what other indiscretion, if it were an indiscretion, can this note refer? You
  have not talked about anybody except Amery and his account?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill was silent for a moment, stupefied by the suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!" he said at last. "He could not have known of our conversation. It
  took place in my private office, where it is impossible, absolutely
  impossible, that we could have been over heard."</p>

  <p>"You have a loud-speaking telephone on your desk: was that switched
  off?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," said Mr. Tupperwill slowly. "It is almost second nature to
  make it dead. I can't say that I am exactly comfortable with that wretched
  American invention, and I've thought once or twice of having it removed. It
  is very useful, for I have only to stretch out my hand and turn a switch to
  talk to any of my departments, but it is dangerous, very dangerous. Now I
  wonder!"</p>

  <p>He pulled at his lip for a long while, trying to remember.</p>

  <p>"It is unlikely," he said, "but there is just the possibility that the
  switch may have been down. Even in that case, which of my staff would betray
  me? No, my dear man, you must get that idea out of your head. It isn't
  possible. There is nothing wrong about Amery. I am almost sorry I expressed
  my doubts to you, if by so doing I have sown the seeds of suspicion in your
  mind."</p>

  <p>Ralph chuckled quietly.</p>

  <p>"In my case they're already in flower," he said. "I admit I'm prejudiced
  against Amery, and would go a long way to do him a real bad turn."</p>

  <p>Then, seeing the shocked expression on the other's face, he went on: "Not
  that I shall."</p>

  <p>"Thank goodness for that!" said Mr. Tupperwill fervently. "I have always
  disliked violence, and now I have a greater antipathy than ever." He touched
  his head tenderly.</p>

  <p>Ralph said no more than the truth, that the thought in the foreground of
  his mind was an opportunity for getting even with the man whom he now hated
  with unparalleled intensity; and that afternoon opportunity took shape.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap24"
     id="chap24">XXIV. THE POISON TEST</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"You're determined to go on Saturday, Miss Marlowe?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Major Amery."</p>

  <p>Amery stood at the window, his hands in his pockets, glooming into the
  street.</p>

  <p>"You will be rather difficult to replace," he said. "Could you overcome
  your very natural reluctance to serve me for another week?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated and was almost lost. If he had ordered her to remain, she
  might not have had the courage to deny him.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I cannot stay after Saturday, Major Amery."</p>

  <p>Somehow she did not expect him to press her to stay then, nor was any
  further reference made to the attack on Mr. Tupperwill. Though she had
  nothing but the kindest feeling for Jessie Dame, she ventured to suggest that
  the girl should take her place when she had gone, for the position was a
  coveted one and carried a salary twice as large as the highest wage earned by
  the most expert stenographer in the firm.</p>

  <p>"She can't spell," was his only comment, and in a way Elsa was glad.</p>

  <p>If she expected him, knowing his pertinacious character, to renew his
  request later in the day, she was&mdash;"disappointed" was about the only
  word which exactly described her feelings when the day wore through and the
  matter was not brought up. At four-thirty the office caterer brought two tea
  trays, and one of these, as usual, she carried into Amery's room. She put the
  tray down on his desk and he nodded, lifted the lid of the teapot and smelt
  it&mdash;a practice of his she had noticed before. This time he looked up
  before her faint smile had completely vanished.</p>

  <p>"That amuses you, eh? I'll show you something else that will amuse you
  more."</p>

  <p>He took a little flat case from his pocket, opened it, tore off a narrow
  slip of sky-blue paper, which he dipped into the milk. When he brought it
  out, the paper was red.</p>

  <p>"Wait," he said, poured the tea into the cup, and this time produced a
  thin pink slip.</p>

  <p>Looking, she saw that the interior of the case held nothing but hundreds
  of these pink and blue slips. The pink paper he dipped into the tea, held it
  for a few seconds, and then drew it out. Where the tea had touched, the paper
  was a bright lemon yellow.</p>

  <p>"A rough test, but reliable. Arsenic turns the milk paper green and the
  tea paper purple. Strychnine turns them both black, so does aconite. Cyanide,
  on the other hand, bleaches the blue paper white and turns the pink paper to
  a deep red."</p>

  <p>Elsa listened, open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you were testing for poison?" she said, almost unable to
  believe her ears.</p>

  <p>"Something like that," he said, and, replacing the case, put the milk and
  sugar in his tea. "By the way, that is one symptom of insanity notion a man
  gets&mdash;that he's being poisoned, or that somebody is attempting his
  life."</p>

  <p>"But poison here!" she said sceptically.</p>

  <p>"Well, why not? I have many enemies, and one, at least, is in the medical
  profession."</p>

  <p>At any other time she would have resented this reference to Ralph Hallam,
  but now the relationship in which these men stood, the knowledge of Ralph's
  terrible business, silenced her.</p>

  <p>Crook against crook&mdash;diamond against diamond! Surely he did not dream
  that Ralph would do so horrible a thing! That he should judge other men by
  himself was a human weakness. Perhaps he was mad, after all. He did not act
  like a normal being. And yet she saw none of the symptoms which she
  associated with an ill-balanced mind. He was a mystery, inscrutable. She had
  read stories of criminals who were endowed with a greatness which
  distinguished them from the rest of mankind, wonderful mentalities perverted
  to base use. Perhaps the sinister man was one of those, an object for
  compassion rather than contempt. On the whole she was very glad that her term
  of employment was coming to a rapid close.</p>

  <p>After tea some letters and a parcel came for him. She put the letters on
  the blotting-pad (he was out) and placed the parcel within reach of him. It
  had come by hand and was addressed: "Major Amery, D.S.O."</p>

  <p>It was the first intimation she had had that he held the Distinguished
  Service Order&mdash;she was constantly finding out new things about him, she
  thought whimsically, and, absorbed in the discovery, she took up a pair of
  scissors and cut the string that fastened the parcel. Invariably she had done
  this for old Mr. Amery, and never realized that the scissors were in her
  hand, till a snarl of anger made her spin round, affrighted. Amery stood in
  the doorway leading to the corridor.</p>

  <p>"What in hell are you doing?" he roared.</p>

  <p>She fell back before the blaze of his eyes. He was so menacing, his mien
  was so savage, his voice so harsh that he terrified her.</p>

  <p>"How often have I told you not to open my parcels?" he growled. His hand
  had dropped on the top of the cardboard box she had exposed.</p>

  <p>"I'm&mdash;I'm awfully sorry. I had forgotten."</p>

  <p>The brown face was sallow. Was that his way of going pale?</p>

  <p>"Do as you're told," he said, and lifted the box carefully in his hand,
  waited a second, and then rapidly took off the lid.</p>

  <p>Reposing in a nest of white cotton wool was a round object, covered with
  white tissue paper. He did not touch it. Instead, he took up the scissors she
  had put down, snipped gingerly at the paper, and pulled a large piece
  aside.</p>

  <p>"Fond of apples?" he asked in a changed voice.</p>

  <p>It was a very small apple, but like no apple she had ever seen, for it
  bristled with steel needle points.</p>

  <p>"That's medical, I'll swear," and she saw his lip lift. "He used a hundred
  needles, and there's death in every point! The cute cuss!"</p>

  <p>There was genuine admiration in his voice.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap25"
     id="chap25">XXV. LAUDANUM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"RATHER ingenious," said Amery. "Not heavy enough for a
  bomb, and when one opened the package, what more natural than to seize this
  paper-covered little ball?"</p>

  <p>"But are they poisoned?" she asked, bewildered. "With what?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. An analyst would find out if I took the trouble to send it
  to an analyst. Anthrax, probably&mdash;or one of a dozen other diseases.
  There is enough venom in the sac of the average cobra to supply all those
  little points with a fatal dose."</p>

  <p>He carefully put the lid on, tied a piece of string round the box, and,
  opening a cupboard, locked it away.</p>

  <p>"Who sent it? Not Ralph&mdash;not Mr. Hallam? You don't for one moment
  imagine he would do such a thing?"</p>

  <p>"Hallam?" He bit his lip thoughtfully. "No, probably not Hallam."</p>

  <p>"Are you Soyoka?" she blurted, and he brought his gaze round to her.</p>

  <p>"Do I look like a stout and middle-aged Japanese gentleman?"</p>

  <p>"I know you're not a Japanese," she said impatiently, "but are you
  Soyoka's agent?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders and looked toward the cupboard.. "Apparently
  there are people who think I am. Dr. Hallam? No I don't think it was Dr.
  Hallam. If I did"&mdash;he showed his teeth for a second in a mirthless grin,
  and she shivered involuntarily.</p>

  <p>"You look dreadful."</p>

  <p>Again she had no intention of speaking. She had surprised herself when she
  had asked him if he was Soyoka.</p>

  <p>For a second she thought he would resent her comment, but he accepted it
  without offence.</p>

  <p>"I <i>am</i> dreadful&mdash;'perfectly horrible' was your remark, if I
  remember rightly. And there are horrible things in this world, Miss Marlowe,
  things you do not guess and cannot know; things I hope you never will know.
  'Horrible' is a word you should never apply to a plain, straightforward dope
  smuggler&mdash;nay, even to a murderer. The real horrors are things that
  newspaper men do not write about; and when you come into contact with these,
  why, you find you've been wasting a whole lot of superlatives, and you're
  stunned for an exact description."</p>

  <p>It was quite a long speech for him, and she had an odd sensation of
  pleasure. She felt almost as if she had been taken behind the steel doors of
  his reserve.</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to think that either murder or drug smuggling is an
  admirable pastime. You're pretty safe in believing that the things your
  mother taught you were wrong, and not all the gilding, or high-class
  thinking, or toney philosophy in the world can make them right. I suppose you
  think those are queer sentiments coming from Soyoka's right-hand man?"</p>

  <p>There was a peculiar glint in his eye, which she chose to regard as
  threatening. Perhaps he was unbending because he wished to persuade her to
  remain with him, but apparently this was not the case, for he did not follow
  up the advantage which his unusual geniality had created.</p>

  <p>For yet another night she postponed her removal to Herbert Mansions. By
  the weariness in Mrs. Trene Hallam's voice when she telephoned her, Elsa
  gathered that the good lady was as anxious to get the visit over as she. Elsa
  slept better that night and went to the office without any preliminary
  searchings of heart.</p>

  <p>She had been at work five minutes when Miss Dame came flying into the
  room, and from her flushed appearance and her startled eyes, Elsa guessed
  that something unusual had happened.</p>

  <p>"Have you heard the news?" hissed the girl melodramatically. Elsa had
  heard too much news of a startling character to be wildly excited.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think is the new manager?"</p>

  <p>One of the sub-managers had been temporarily appointed to fill Mr. Tarn's
  position. That it was only a temporary appointment Elsa was now to learn for
  the first time.</p>

  <p>"He's in the office, sitting there as large as life, giving orders to
  white Christian people."</p>

  <p>"Not Feng Ho!" gasped Elsa,</p>

  <p>"Feng Ho," said Miss Dame impressively. "That's the last straw! If Amery
  expects well-educated young ladies to take their orders from a savage, well,
  he's got another guess coming. I know what the Chinese are, with their opium
  dens and their fan-tans and other instruments of torture. Not me, my girl!"
  Miss Dame shivered in her indignation. "I'm going to tell his nibs."</p>

  <p>"Tell him now," said Amery's cold voice.</p>

  <p>Elsa always jumped at the sound of him, but Miss Dame literally leapt.</p>

  <p>Paul Amery stood in the doorway, his hands in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"Tell him now. I gather you object to Feng Ho as general manager. I regret
  that I did not call you to the board meeting which decided upon the
  appointment, but I like to be alone when I make these momentous decisions.
  What is your objection, Miss Dame?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," stammered Miss Dame, going red and white, "he's Chinese and
  foreign."</p>

  <p>"Don't you realize that you're Chinese and foreign to him? As to his being
  an ignoramus or a savage, as you suggested a little time ago, he is a
  particularly well educated gentleman. At least he can spell," he added
  significantly.</p>

  <p>Elsa thought this was cruel.</p>

  <p>"He may be able to spell in Chinese," said Miss Dame with dignity, "but
  that's neither here nor there. I'm not much of a speller myself, I admit.
  Only you can quite understand, Major Amery, that we girls have got to look
  out for ourselves."</p>

  <p>Miss Dame's attempt to drag Elsa into the argument amused the girl.
  Apparently it amused the sinister man also, for his lips twitched.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ho will not bother you, or interfere with you in any way. He will
  deal entirely with the Chinese trade, which is by far the most important
  department of our business."</p>

  <p>When he had gone:</p>

  <p>"Wasn't he mild?" said Miss Dame. "He must have seen by my eye that I
  wasn't going to let him start something without my being there to ring the
  bell. Put a man in his place once, and he stays there. And listen, Miss
  Marlowe: I had my horoscope cast this morning&mdash;at least, the letter came
  this morning. I was born under Pisces, and I'm supposed to be highly
  emotional, imaginative, observant, artistic, musical, precise and
  prudent!"</p>

  <p>"In those circumstances," said Elsa, "I think you may be able to cope with
  Mr. Feng Ho as general manager. You seem to have all the qualities that a
  girl should possess in those difficult circumstances."</p>

  <p>Miss Dame scratched her head with the end of her pencil. "It never struck
  me that way," she said, "but perhaps you're right."</p>

  <p>Elsa did not go out to lunch: she had not forgotten her encounter with the
  press photographers, and until the case was settled she decided to lunch in
  the office.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that she did so, for Bickerson called to ask, with
  variations, the same wearing string of questions that he had asked at least a
  dozen times before: the names of Tarn's relatives, particulars of his
  friendships, his animosities, his likes and dislikes, his habits, his houses
  of call, his clubs.</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary to ask me all this again?" said Elsa wearily. "I think
  I've told you this before." And then, as though the thought occurred to her
  but was too preposterous to entertain:</p>

  <p>"You're not expecting me to vary my story? Oh, Mr. Bickerson, you
  are!"</p>

  <p>The stolid Bickerson smiled innocently.</p>

  <p>"A witness sometimes remembers fresh incidents," he said; "and you can
  well understand, Miss Marlowe, that everybody in that house when the murder
  was committed has to be questioned and cross-questioned. It is part of our
  system of detection."</p>

  <p>"Did you cross-question Feng Ho?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The smile came off his face.</p>

  <p>"I certainly cross-questioned him to a degree, but he had his alibi all
  done up in silver paper; we couldn't have broken it with a steam hammer.
  Major Amery in?"</p>

  <p>"No, he's gone out," she said. "Did you want to see him?"</p>

  <p>"No," he said carelessly, "I don't particularly want to see him. If he's
  there I'll stroll in."</p>

  <p>"I'll see," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>As she expected, Amery was gone. But Mr. Bickerson was not content, either
  with the view he had of the room through the doorway, or with his earlier and
  closer inspection of the apartment. He strolled in past the girl, humming an
  aria. (He was something of a baritone, and had a reputation in amateur
  operatic circles.)</p>

  <p>"A very nice little room this," he said. "An extremely nice little room.
  Would you be so kind as to go downstairs and tell my man at the door that I'm
  waiting for Major Amery?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him squarely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will, if you'll be so kind as to come out of the room and let me
  lock the door," she said.</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"You think I'm going to conduct a quiet little search on my own eh,
  without the formality of a warrant? Well, you were right, only I've got the
  warrant, you see."</p>

  <p>He produced a blue paper and handed it to her.</p>

  <p>"It would have been ever so much better if I could have done this quietly,
  without Major Amery knowing anything about it, but I respect your scruples,
  and if you'd rather I waited until the Major came in, I will do so."</p>

  <p>They had talked ten minutes when Elsa heard the door of Amery's room
  close, and went in to him.</p>

  <p>"A search warrant, has he? I wondered when that would come. Tell him to
  step in. Good-morning, Bickerson. You want to have a look round, Miss Marlowe
  tells me. Sail right in."</p>

  <p>"I've got a pro forma warrant," said Bickerson with a shrug, "but that
  means nothing." And then: "Bit of a tough case, that of Mr. Tupperwill's the
  other night?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you've heard about it, have you? Who squealed&mdash;Mr.
  Tupperwill?"</p>

  <p>Bickerson scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"Nobody exactly squealed," he said. "It came to me in the ordinary way of
  business."</p>

  <p>"Was it Mr. Tupperwill or the excellent Dr. Hallam?" persisted Amery.</p>

  <p>"Know him?" asked Bickerson, his keen eyes on the other's face.</p>

  <p>"I am acquainted with him, yes."</p>

  <p>"It is a queer thing, that case of Tupperwill," drawled Bickerson. "I
  wonder you didn't report it to the police straight away, Major Amery?"</p>

  <p>"You mean Tupperwill's beating?"</p>

  <p>Bickerson nodded, and saw the thin lips twitch.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, there's nothing to that, is there? Those things happen every
  day."</p>

  <p>"Not in London. They may happen in Calcutta, and they may happen in
  Shanghai, where the sight of a Chinese policeman half beaten to death doesn't
  create so much of a scandal as it might in, say, Regent Street or Piccadilly
  Circus."</p>

  <p>"I get you," said Amery.</p>

  <p>He opened a box on his table, took out a thin black cigar and lit it.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I ought to have reported it to the police, but it's up to
  Tupperwill. After all, he was the aggrieved party."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" The detective was inspecting his shoes earnestly. "Curious that
  dust up should happen outside your house."</p>

  <p>"Very curious. Equally curious that it should happen outside anybody's
  house," said Amery coolly.</p>

  <p>There was a little pause in the conversation. Bickerson was evidently
  turning over certain matters in his mind.</p>

  <p>"There is a feud between two gangs that are operating in London&mdash;two
  dope gangs: the amateurs, and Soyoka's crowd. I have reason to believe that
  Tupperwill has offended one of the gangs in some way."</p>

  <p>"So I understand."</p>

  <p>"Do you know how?" asked Bickerson quickly.</p>

  <p>"I only know what he told me, that he had had a letter saying that he was
  talking too much. It seemed to me rather an inadequate reason for beating his
  head off, for I think you will agree that, if every man who talked too much
  was flogged for his sins, there would be few people in London, or New York
  for the matter of that, who could wear hats with comfort."</p>

  <p>Another interval, during which the sinister man puffed steadily at his
  cigar and watched the windows on the opposite side of the street with curious
  interest.</p>

  <p>"You have travelled extensively in the East, Major. Rave you ever met
  Soyoka?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Have you?"</p>

  <p>He pushed the cigar-box toward the detective, and Bickerson helped himself
  and was now holding a match to the end. He waited until he had most carefully
  and deliberately extinguished the flame, and put the stick in a copper
  ash-tray before he answered.</p>

  <p>"I've seen members of the gang, but I've never seen Soyoka. Met them in
  town. They're a slippery little crowd to hold. The amateurs may be easy,
  because we've got a line to them. There are one or two men in the Midlands
  who ought to have received that warning about talking too much&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have met some members of the Soyoka gang?" interrupted Amery with
  polite interest. "You interest me. What are they like?"</p>

  <p>"They are very much like you"&mdash;a pause&mdash;"or me. Very ordinary,
  everyday people, whom you wouldn't suspect of pulling down a comfortable
  income out of filling the psychopathic wards. There's thirty thousand pounds
  a week spent on drugs in this country&mdash;on illicit drugs, you
  understand&mdash;which is considerably over a million and a half a year.
  There's eighty per cent profit, and the trade is in a few hands. You
  understand, Major Amery?"</p>

  <p>Amery nodded.</p>

  <p>"Which means," the detective continued, "that it is worth the while of
  really swell firms to take up this trade, because it's growing and the
  million and a half this year is going to be three millions next year unless
  we find the man who will turn King's evidence&mdash;State's evidence they
  call it in America, don't they?"</p>

  <p>"So I understand," said Amery. "In other words, unless you get a real
  valuable squeak, you don't think you'll catch Soyoka?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I mean. I don't think we'll catch him this year. We may have
  a stroke of luck; we may break the gang by finding the man who murdered
  Maurice Tarn, whether that man is white or yellow."</p>

  <p>"I see: you've still got poor Feng Ho under suspicion?"</p>

  <p>"I've nobody under suspicion," said the detective calmly. "Feng Ho had his
  alibi in good order."</p>

  <p>He rose to go.</p>

  <p>"Pretty smart girl, that&mdash;Miss Marlowe, I mean. I was going to take a
  quiet look round your place, but she wouldn't have it."</p>

  <p>"Is she under suspicion too?"</p>

  <p>The detective carefully flicked off the ash of his cigar into the
  fireplace.</p>

  <p>"No, she isn't under suspicion; she's all right, unless...</p>

  <p>"Unless what?" asked the other sharply.</p>

  <p>"Unless we were able to prove that, at some time before the murder, she
  purchased from a chemist some two ounces of laudanum."</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>"I am referring to the laudanum that was found in the nearly empty bottle
  of brandy that stood by Maurice Tarn's side, and from which he had been
  drinking all the evening," said the detective. "Good afternoon!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap26"
     id="chap26">XXVI. AN IMPULSIVE QUESTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ELSA heard him going down the passage, humming his aria,
  little dreaming of the onus which this officer of the law was attaching to
  her.</p>

  <p>After the luncheon hour she was usually very busy, but the sinister man
  did not send for her, though he was still in his room. She had to take a file
  into the office that had been her uncle's, and it was with a little twinge of
  pain that she knocked at the door and heard Feng Ho's soft voice bid her
  enter. She need have been under no apprehension, for nothing remained to
  remind her of Maurice Tarn. The office had been completely cleared; there was
  not an article of furniture, not so much as a hanging almanac, to remind her
  of the man who had passed in so mysterious, so dreadful a fashion. Instead,
  the carpet had been removed, the floor scrubbed, and in the centre of the
  room was a square of grass matting.</p>

  <p>Feng Ho sat cross-legged at a little table which was not more than a foot
  from the floor, and seemed wholly inadequate, since the gilded cage occupied
  more than half the available writing space, and his ink and brushes took up
  most of the remainder. He had discarded some of his modern garments: she saw
  his coat and hat hanging up on a hook behind the door: and he wore, instead,
  a little black silk jacket, buttoned closely to his neck and braided in most
  unexpected places.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, miss." He gave her his usual grin. "Pi has missed you
  excessively."</p>

  <p>And, as though corroborating his master's statement, the little canary
  burst forth into a wild jamboree of song, which ceased as suddenly as it
  began.</p>

  <p>What made her ask the question, she did not know. Nothing was farther from
  her thoughts when she had come in. But these seemed days of impulse.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ho, did you kill Mr. Tarn?" she asked, and stood aghast at her own
  fatuity.</p>

  <p>The little man was neither disconcerted nor hurt.</p>

  <p>"Miss, I have not killed a gentleman for a very long time," he said, "not
  intentionally, with malice aforethought, according to law. Some time
  ago&mdash;yes. It was vitally essential to decapitate certain Chinamen who
  had been rude to my papa, viz., cutting his throat with a sharp
  instrument."</p>

  <p>"I really don't know why I asked you," she said.</p>

  <p>She could have cried with vexation at her own stupidity.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me, if you will pardon me, miss, curiously inept. For if I
  had decapitated or otherwise destroyed my aged predecessor, it is extremely
  improbable that I would make an official statement for the titillation of
  official ears. Even a bachelor of science is not so scientific as to tell the
  truth when same leads to intensive hanging by the neck."</p>

  <p>Which was logical and true. Because she guessed that Feng Ho would tell
  the Major, she seized the earliest opportunity of forestalling him.</p>

  <p>"It was a silly question, and I don't know why I asked," she said
  ruefully.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you did," he said. "You still think Feng Ho was with him when he
  died?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure."</p>

  <p>"And yet you never told the police? It was only by the discovery of the
  hat that they were able to connect him with the crime&mdash;and, of course,"
  he added as an afterthought, "the policeman saw him."</p>

  <p>"And you saw him," she accused.</p>

  <p>He raised his eyes and looked at her through halt-closed eyelids.</p>

  <p>"What makes you say that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You were on the spot when the murder was committed. If it were Feng Ho I
  saw in the room, he would go straight to you. Of course you saw him!"</p>

  <p>"Of course I saw him." His voice was almost mocking. "And yet, curiously
  enough, no policeman has connected my visit with Feng Ho. You ought to be at
  Scotland Yard. By the way," he said, "do you ever have toothache?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him in wonder.</p>

  <p>"Toothache, Major Amery? No; why?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It occurred to me that you might suffer that way; most
  young people do. If you did, I have a much better medicine than laudanum,
  which is dangerous stuff to handle."</p>

  <p>He saw her brows meet in a frown.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're trying to say," she said. "I know nothing about
  laudanum; I've never seen it. What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>For the second time she saw the quick flash of his teeth in a smile.</p>

  <p>"What a suspicious person you are, Miss Marlowe! I'm almost glad you're
  going," was all the explanation he offered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap27"
     id="chap27">XXVII. ELSA PACKS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON the Saturday morning, when her pay envelope came, Elsa
  opened it with mingled feelings of relief and regret. Though the sinister man
  had reverted to his normal condition of taciturnity, he had been a little
  more bearable, and she found some new characteristic every day; something
  which, if it could not be admired, was so far out of the ordinary that it was
  interesting.</p>

  <p>Without counting the money, she looked at the pay slip and found that she
  had received a substantial addition for her "overtime." Inconsistently, she
  wished he had not paid her this money: she would have preferred to give that
  extra piece of service, though why, she did not know.</p>

  <p>At one o'clock, the hour at which she was to leave, she tidied her desk,
  emptied the drawers of her personal belongings, and at last, with a queer
  feeling of dismay, which had nothing to do with the fact that she was now out
  of employment, for Tarn's lawyer had hinted to her that the dead man had left
  her a substantial sum of money, upon which she might draw, she knocked at the
  door of Amery's room and went in.</p>

  <p>He was pacing the floor slowly; stopped and turned as she entered, and
  raised his eyebrows enquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going," she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course, it's Saturday. Thank you, Miss Marlowe, I will deal with
  the Nangpoo correspondence on Monday morning. Will you remind me, when the
  Chinese mail comes in, that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elsa smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"I shall not be here to remind you, Major Amery," she said. He looked at
  her, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Why won't you be here?"</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;well, I'm leaving to-day. You knew that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course!"</p>

  <p>He had forgotten! And then: "When is the adjourned inquest?"</p>

  <p>"On Monday."</p>

  <p>He bit his lip, and she wondered whether that little pucker of brow had to
  do with her, or such inconvenience as the sudden death of Maurice Tarn had
  caused.</p>

  <p>"You had better postpone your resignation till next Saturday," he said,
  and for some absurd reason she could have thanked him.</p>

  <p>Her self-respect, however, called for a protest.</p>

  <p>"I've arranged to go to-day," she said, in a panic lest he should agree to
  that course.</p>

  <p>"And I've arranged for you to go next Saturday. I cannot be left at the
  mercy of a woman who spells 'India' with a 'y.' Thank you."</p>

  <p>With a nod, more gracious than usual, he sent her back to the outer office
  with mixed feelings. She agreed, as she returned her belongings to their
  places, that one week more or less did not count; that on the whole it would
  be more satisfactory to remain at Amery's until the inquest was ended.</p>

  <p>Although she was not to be called as a witness, she dreaded the renewal of
  the enquiry, but the adjourned proceedings lasted only two hours, at the end
  of which time a bored jury returned the usual verdict of "Murder against some
  person or persons unknown."</p>

  <p>Ralph she did not see in court, though he was there for half an hour,
  standing at the back of the public gallery; and she was back at the office in
  time to take in Major Amery's tea. Apparently he did not object to her
  overlooking the rapid immersion of the little slips in tea and milk.</p>

  <p>"What happened at the court to-day?" he asked as she was going.</p>

  <p>"The jury returned a verdict," she said.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Major Amery," she asked, "do you think they will track the murderer?"</p>

  <p>He looked up slowly.</p>

  <p>"There are an average of fifty-six murders committed in London every year.
  Twenty-eight of the murderers are captured and sent for trial; twenty-seven
  decimal something die by their own hands, and the other fraction escape the
  processes of the law. The odds are fifty-six multiplied by about three
  hundred that the murderer will be caught. By the way, did you see friend
  Hallam?"</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't seen him," said Elsa, before she appreciated the
  impertinence of the question. "He telephoned me yesterday to ask me
  something."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"You didn't by any chance mention my little toothache jest?"</p>

  <p>"Toothache? Oh, you mean the laudanum? Why, no, of course not. Why should
  I?"</p>

  <p>He was looking down at his tea and did not look up.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't if I were you. Are you staying on at the hotel?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, it is much too expensive. I am staying with a&mdash;friend for a
  week, and then I am finding a little flat. The police have given over Mr.
  Tarn's maisonette to me, and I am going to sort out my belongings. After that
  the lawyers are putting the furniture in the hands of an auctioneer. I wanted
  to go early to-night, if you do not mind."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, you can go at once. Does Hallam know you are making your
  farewell visit to Elgin Crescent?"</p>

  <p>She frowned at him. This man asked the most offensive questions.</p>

  <p>"Why should he be there? He is certainly a friend of ours, but I do not
  find Dr. Hallam so indispensable that I cannot do without him. Why do you so
  persistently speak about him, Major Amery?"</p>

  <p>"He amuses me," said the other.</p>

  <p>She had certainly never found Ralph very amusing.</p>

  <p>The lawyer's clerk was waiting for her when she arrived at Elgin Crescent,
  and she was glad to have somebody else in that house of death. The place
  looked dirty and forlorn, and it was a most depressing task to gather her
  little belongings. Her search for a missing book took her into Tarn's study.
  This room had evidently been the object of a very thorough search, for the
  books had been removed from the shelves, tables and chairs had been set back
  against the wall and the carpet was rolled up. She was glad. In its present
  state of disorder there was little to remind her of the home she had shared
  for so many years.</p>

  <p>She filled one trunk and went to the lumber-room in search of a big wooden
  case that was hers, and which, as a girl, used to accompany her on her annual
  holidays. It was really a series of boxes within a box, for its interior
  consisted of five wooden trays that fitted one on top of the other. With the
  assistance of the servant, who had come in to help, she carried the box back
  to her room, opened it and took out the top three trays. The fourth, however,
  refused to budge.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about it, Emily," said Elsa. "There's room enough in the top
  three for all I want to take away."</p>

  <p>She finished her packing quickly, for it was growing dark and she had no
  wish to be in the house after night had fallen. Her packing finished, she
  took a last look round, and then, with a feeling of thankfulness that she was
  leaving behind her so much that was mean and sordid and altogether unhappy,
  she went downstairs, handed the key to the lawyer's clerk, and submitted to
  the tearful farewells of the daily help, who, in virtue of the publicity
  which she had acquired, had assumed the style of an old family retainer. Elsa
  was very glad when the cab turned into Colville Gardens, and the drear
  thoroughfare was lost to sight, as she hoped, for ever.</p>

  <p>Leaving the largest and the least necessary of the boxes in the hotel
  store, she paid her bill, and, with the remainder of her baggage, went on to
  Herbert Mansions. Her promised visit to Mrs. Trene Hallam could no longer be
  postponed, but she went in the spirit of one who had before her an experience
  both unpleasant and inevitable.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap28"
     id="chap28">XXVIII. THE VISITOR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RALPH HALLAM opened the window for the sixth time and looked
  out. There was no cab in sight, and he returned to his armchair before the
  fireplace, already littered with the ashes of his cigarettes.</p>

  <p>"It is many years since you waited for me like that, Ralph," said Mrs.
  Hallam, without resentment.</p>

  <p>"I fail to remember that I ever waited," he snapped. "Don't get funny,
  Lou."</p>

  <p>The woman laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"What is he like, the old boy?" she asked. "Am I supposed to be on my best
  behaviour, or do I treat him as one of ourselves?"</p>

  <p>"The 'old boy' is my banker, one of the leading men of the City of London,
  who will jump out of his skin at the first sound of anything raw."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hallam sighed heavily.</p>

  <p>"Whenever you fix a dinner party for me," she said in despair, "you always
  bring the dead ones! If this is the kind of life you live, Ralph, I wonder
  you don't grow old! Personally, I like a party that starts with cocktails and
  finishes with breakfast."</p>

  <p>He made a little grimace of distaste.</p>

  <p>"That's vulgar, I suppose," she said, watching him closely. "Put it down
  to my gutter training&mdash;you haven't mentioned the word 'gutter' for a
  week. And here's your young and beautiful lady." She rose, as the distant
  tinkle of the bell came to her.</p>

  <p>Until Elsa had been shown her quarters, a beautifully furnished bedroom
  and a tiny sitting-mom, she had no idea that Ralph was in the flat.</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd come and see you installed," he said, as he shook
  hands.</p>

  <p>She was not sorry he was there, for she felt a little ill at ease in the
  presence of his "sister-in-law."</p>

  <p>"We have a very dear friend of ours coming to dinner to-night, and a
  friend of yours too, I think," said Mrs. Hallam archly. "You know dear Mr.
  Tuckerwill?"</p>

  <p>"Tupperwill," said Ralph loudly.</p>

  <p>Elsa observed the slip, and wondered how dear a friend he could be that
  she had forgotten his name.</p>

  <p>"He isn't exactly a friend of mine. I've met him twice&mdash;poor
  man!"</p>

  <p>"He's quite recovered," said Ralph.</p>

  <p>Then, seeing that his wife was in the dark as to Tupperwill's injury, and
  was likely to betray the fact that she had never met him before in her life,
  he made some excuse and took her out of the room.</p>

  <p>"Tupperwill was held up the other night by thugs. And remember his name,
  please," he said unpleasantly. "That girl is as sharp as needles&mdash;there
  was no need whatever for you to call him your dear friend; you've never met
  him."</p>

  <p>"What is he coming for, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"He is coming," said Ralph deliberately, "in order mainly to counteract
  any bad impression which you may make. I want this girl to feel a little more
  confidence in you than she does. At the moment she is nervous, and unless she
  gets more comfortable, you'll find she has an urgent message calling her back
  to the hotel, and I don't want that. In the next few days I'm giving her an
  insight into my profession."</p>

  <p>"Which is&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Never you mind what it is. She will be helpful. Now do you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>Already Elsa was wishing she had not come, or that the ordeal was over,
  for ordeal undoubtedly it was. She did not trust Mrs. Trene Hallam. Her
  sweetness was superficial and insincere. There was no disguising the hardness
  that lay beneath that all too ready smile.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill arrived a little later, just after she had changed for
  dinner and had returned to the drawing mom. He looked none the worse for his
  adventure, and was, if anything, a little more talkative. The solemn eyes
  lightened at the sight of her, and he hurried across the room to offer a very
  warm, soft hand.</p>

  <p>"This is indeed a delightful surprise," he said. "We meet in circumstances
  which are a little more favourable to polite conversation."</p>

  <p>"You know my sister-in-law," said Ralph, and Mrs. Hallam, who could recall
  previous acquaintances on the spur of the moment, was at her gushing
  best.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, as a social event, the dinner was an abject failure. Lou was
  bored to extinction; the girl's face wore a strained look as her uneasiness
  increased; and the only person thoroughly satisfied with things as he found
  them was Mr Tupperwill, who, having got on to his favourite topic, which was
  the derivations of the English language, was prepared to do all the talking,
  and would have continued his discourse on philology until the end of the
  evening, if Ralph had not brought him back to a less gentle theme.</p>

  <p>"No, the police have made no discovery," said Mr. Tupperwill, shaking his
  head mournfully. "I was rather annoyed that the police knew anything about
  it, and I can't understand how, unless Major Amery told them. I am sure you
  would not have taken that step, my dear Hallam."</p>

  <p>"Of course I told them," said Ralph promptly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill looked pained.</p>

  <p>"It was my duty. I suppose Bickerson came to see you?"</p>

  <p>"He has seen me twice," said Mr. Tupperwill. "An extremely pleasant man,
  but immensely inquisitive. By the way"&mdash;he dropped his voice and leant
  over toward Ralph, and his tone became confidential and beyond the hearing of
  the rest of the company&mdash;"what you expected has happened. A certain
  person has closed his account!"</p>

  <p>Ralph glanced significantly at the girl, and Mr. Tupperwill showed signs
  of momentary confusion.</p>

  <p>"He has, has he? I thought he would&mdash;I could have betted on it!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill did not bet, and said so.</p>

  <p>"I would like to discuss the matter later," he added, with his eyes on
  Elsa Marlowe.</p>

  <p>The opportunity came when Mrs. Hallam carried her away to see the
  photographs of her prize dogs.</p>

  <p>"He has closed the account, you say? And taken away the box also?"</p>

  <p>Tupperwill nodded.</p>

  <p>"This is the first and last time I shall ever be guilty of discussing the
  business of the bank, even with my best friend," he said soberly. "Without
  accepting your theory, which I dismissed rather hastily as preposterous, that
  Amery had anything what ever to do with my terrible experience, I am
  satisfied that a business man is on the safest side by keeping a quiet
  tongue."</p>

  <p>He delivered this sentiment with the air of one who had made a great
  discovery, and swayed back to observe the effect.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he has closed the account without giving any explanation, and I can
  only assure you that I am very, very happy about it. You can have no
  conception of the state of mind I have been in for the past week or so, at
  the thought that Stebbing's held an account of a man who, although to outward
  appearance is a respected member of society, may&mdash;I only say
  may&mdash;be connected, directly or indirectly, with an enterprise which,
  possibly inoffensive in itself, would be looked upon with disfavour by my
  directors."</p>

  <p>Having stated this reserved opinion, Mr. Tupperwill waved his hand as
  though to dismiss the subject.</p>

  <p>The door opened and Lou came in. Ralph Hallam saw by her face that
  something disturbing had happened.</p>

  <p>"A man wishes to see you, Ralph. He says he would like to speak to you
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bickerson."</p>

  <p>The two men exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure it is Mr. Hallam and not me?" asked Tupperwill.</p>

  <p>"No, he wants to see Ralph. Perhaps, Mr. Tupperwill, you will come along
  and see my photographs?"</p>

  <p>The fat man was apparently only too glad of an excuse to join the girl, on
  whom he had cast many furtive and admiring glances in the course of the meal,
  and in his haste preceded his hostess from the room. A few seconds later
  Bickerson came in and closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to see me particularly? Has anything turned up?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, something has turned up," said Bickerson. His voice was cold, his
  manner a little distant. Uninvited, he took the chair that Tupperwill had
  vacated. "At the end of the garden in Elgin Crescent," he said, "there is a
  line of railings running parallel with the sidewalk, and a clump of laurel
  bushes, into which anybody passing along Ladbroke Grove might toss something
  and be pretty confident that it would never appear again. Unfortunately, the
  gardeners have been at work on trimming the bushes, and they found this."</p>

  <p>He took out of his pocket a small fluted phial with a red label and put it
  on the table. Ralph gazed at it steadily, and did not betray by so much as a
  flicker of eyelid his interest in this damning piece of evidence.</p>

  <p>"When it was found it contained about four drachms of tincture of opium,
  which is the medical name for laudanum," Bickerson went on. "It was purchased
  at a chemist's in Piccadilly a day before Tarn's death. The name in the
  poison book is yours, Hallam. Now I'm going to tell you something."</p>

  <p>He shifted the chair round to face the other squarely.</p>

  <p>"Part of the medical evidence at the inquest was suppressed, at my
  request. It was that laudanum had been found in the body of old Tarn, and
  that the brandy bottle at his elbow was also heavily doped. You can take your
  time to explain, but I warn you that anything you may say may be taken down
  and used against you in a certain event."</p>

  <p>"What event is that?" asked Hallam steadily.</p>

  <p>"In the event of my charging you with Tarn's murder," was the reply.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap29"
     id="chap29">XXIX. PACE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RALPH took up the bottle and examined it with an amused
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly true," he said coolly. "I purchased this tincture of opium at
  Keppell's&mdash;on behalf of Tarn. As a matter of detail, I prescribed
  laudanum for him&mdash;he suffered from insomnia. The fact that the bottle
  was found in the bushes makes it look suspicious, eh? In the ash-can it would
  have been damning, I suppose? And is that the new police theory, that Mr.
  Maurice Tarn died of opium poisoning? I seem to remember a small
  black-handled knife: had not that something to do with his lamented
  death?"</p>

  <p>"Do you suggest that Tarn put the laudanum in his own brandy?" demanded
  Bickerson.</p>

  <p>"I suggest nothing," said Ralph with a shrug. "It is not my business to
  make suggestions. For the moment, I am rejecting certain innuendoes which
  connect me with Tarn's death."</p>

  <p>He looked at the detective thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"If it were my business I should suggest how remarkable it was that you
  did not make any reference at the inquest to the telephone conversation you
  had with Mr. Tarn."</p>

  <p>The detective's face flushed an angry red.</p>

  <p>"That wasn't necessary," he said stiffly. "The telephone conversation
  which occurred in your presence involved the name of a third person. There
  was a whole lot of evidence not produced at the inquest, Hallam&mdash;for
  example, I thought it wise not to refer to the fact that two hours before
  Tarn's death you were in the house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With Miss Marlowe," interrupted Ralph.</p>

  <p>"You were in the house, and had ample opportunity for going to his room
  and doping the brandy he drank, and which you knew he would drink, having a
  good idea of his habits."</p>

  <p>Ralph laughed.</p>

  <p>"Then you suggest that Miss Marlowe was a party to my doping the brandy? I
  tell you she was in the house all the time, and I left her there. And why
  should I want to dope him?"</p>

  <p>The detective did not answer this last question immediately. Instead: "I
  have cross-examined Miss Marlowe very thoroughly, and I know that she left
  you on the study floor and went up to her room to pack. She intended spending
  the night with a relation of yours. She left you alone for ten minutes. And
  as to the other matter, I'm going to speak straight to you, Hallam. I have
  every reason to believe that you were associated with Tarn in his
  dope-running business. If that is so, and by some means you got to know that
  the old man had asked to see me at nine o'clock that night, there is a
  possibility that you may have suspected that he intended making a statement
  which would incriminate you. I'll tell you frankly that I do not believe the
  story that you procured this laudanum for Tarn and at his request."</p>

  <p>Ralph stiffened. He was alert now. The danger he had thought was past had
  reappeared in its most alarming form.</p>

  <p>"I don't like your tone, Bickerson," he said. "If you believe that I was
  running dope, or that I am in any way connected with Tarn, or responsible,
  directly or indirectly, for his death, your course is a very simple one."</p>

  <p>Bickerson's face was expressionless, and Ralph saw that he was not
  prepared to accept the challenge which had been thrown out.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it is," said the detective, "but I am pretty certain just what I
  shall find if I go farther into this matter. The laudanum will be in your
  prescription book, under Tarn's name."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he laughed and held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've annoyed you, doctor, but this murder has rather rattled
  me, and the dope gang has got me thoroughly at sea. In a few days I shall
  know much more about them than I know now."</p>

  <p>He picked up the laudanum bottle from the table, looked at it with a
  little grimace, and put the phial in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I want to get just a little more information, and there will be sad
  hearts in dreamland!" he said cryptically.</p>

  <p>Ralph showed him to the door, and the man stood outside for a while,
  cogitating, before, with a brusque "Good-night," he passed down the wide
  stairs into the street. As Dr. Hallam closed the door on him, the tension
  relaxed and he sat down heavily upon a hall chair and wiped his streaming
  forehead.</p>

  <p>What a fool he had been! It would have been a simple matter to carry the
  phial home and put it in the furnace; but a moment of over anxiety had led
  him to commit a folly which might well have proved his undoing. Bickerson was
  right in one respect. The prescription book in Half Moon Street would show
  the destination of that small bottle. Strangely enough, it had been an act of
  precaution, taken as an afterthought, and he blessed the inspiration which
  had led him to scrawl a bogus prescription in a volume which nowadays was
  very seldom used.</p>

  <p>It was fully five minutes before he had composed himself and strolled into
  the drawing-room. Lou looked up with an anxious, enquiring glance as he came
  in, but could read nothing from his face. Elsa was playing at the piano, with
  the stout Mr. Tupperwill, one podgy finger on the leaf of the music, ready to
  turn the page at her nod.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong?" asked Mrs. Hallam in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Ralph. "He wanted to see me about Tarn."</p>

  <p>He glanced at Tupperwill and smiled again.</p>

  <p>"Almost looks as if he's fallen," he said.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hallam nodded.</p>

  <p>"He's certainly got it bad," she said, and for some perverse reason Ralph
  Hallam was pleased.</p>

  <p>Yet he had no thought of influencing the banker when he had invited him to
  that informal dinner. His sole object had been to create a little confidence
  in the unquiet mind of the girl. Sensitive to her moods, he realized
  something of her uneasiness, and had played Tupperwill for
  respectability.</p>

  <p>"A beautiful piece, a very bee-u-tiful piece!" sighed Mr. Tupperwill,
  turning the last page reluctantly. "'Peace, perfect Peace!' It is the motto
  on which my house is run. It is the keynote of my life. My private safe opens
  to the combination 'Pace'&mdash;a root word&mdash;er&mdash;um... " He saw
  Mrs. Hallam's eager eyes fixed on him and shifted uncomfortably. "Do you
  sing, Miss Marlowe?" he asked, turning to the girl.</p>

  <p>Elsa laughed.</p>

  <p>"I sing behind locked doors," she said solemnly. "Which means that I
  realize my limitations."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill sighed again.</p>

  <p>"It is a great pity." His eyes were full of undisguised admiration. "A
  very great pity. I can imagine you charming vast audiences, or, shall I say,
  bringing ecstasy to the heart of an audience&mdash;of one! You have great
  gifts, Miss Marlowe."</p>

  <p>Elsa laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"It is very pleasant to hear that," she said drily. "I will set your
  compliment against the many unflattering things I hear in the course of the
  day."</p>

  <p>"Which means that Amery has the manners of a pig," said Ralph.</p>

  <p>"Amery?" Mr. Tupperwill looked round with a start of surprise. "Surely you
  are not associated with Mr. Amery?"</p>

  <p>"I work in his office, if that is an association," said the girl, a little
  nettled.</p>

  <p>Why she should resent even the oblique disparagement in Mr. Tupperwill's
  tone she did not know exactly. But she did.</p>

  <p>"It is a mistake to think that I hear many uncomplimentary things from
  Major Amery," she said; "and if all the stories I hear from office girls are
  true, then it is a great advantage to have an employer who is neither
  soft-spoken nor too friendly!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill pulled at his lip</p>

  <p>"That is true," he said, "that is very true. You will quite understand
  that I am not saying a word derogatory to Major Amery," he hastened to
  protest. "It would indeed be a most improper act on my part to detract (from
  'de,' away, 'trahere,' to draw or pull&mdash;in other words, to take away)
  from his merits. That, indeed, would be unpardonable."</p>

  <p>Elsa changed the subject somewhat gauchely, and a few minutes later found
  herself being initiated into the mysteries of bridge.</p>

  <p>At ten-thirty Mr. Tupperwill glanced at his watch and uttered a note of
  alarm.</p>

  <p>"I fear I have overstayed my welcome," he said, "but I have had a most
  delightful evening, a perfectly delightful evening! I can never thank you
  enough for giving me this opportunity of getting out of myself, my dear
  Hallam."</p>

  <p>He looked from one to the other, his smooth brow bent. "Would it be
  regarded as an impertinence if I invited you to dine with me to-morrow
  night&mdash;would that interfere very much with your arrangements?"</p>

  <p>Elsa had no arrangements, and no particular desires except, at the
  earliest possible moment, to find a small flat and bring her visit to the
  earliest possible conclusion. Ralph saved her the embarrassment of replying
  by a prompt acceptance of the invitation. He accompanied Mr. Tupperwill to
  his car, and when he returned the girl had gone, and Mrs. Hallam was sitting
  on the hearth-rug, smoking a meditative cigarette before the fire.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" she asked, looking up.</p>

  <p>"My banker. Where is Elsa?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hallam jerked her head in the direction of Elsa's room.</p>

  <p>"Am I supposed to go to this party of his to-morrow night?" she asked.
  "That old man is certainly the slowest thing that has happened since horse
  'buses went out. And you're a fool to let her go, anyway, Ralph. The old boy
  is dippy about her."</p>

  <p>"About Elsa?" Ralph chuckled. "Yes, I thought he was rather smitten."</p>

  <p>"He's married, of course?" said Mrs. Hallam, blowing a ring of smoke at
  the fire.</p>

  <p>"He isn't married: that kind of man won't marry, either."</p>

  <p>"Won't he?" said the woman sardonically. "Tupperwill is the kind of man
  that keeps himself single and solvent till he's sixty, and then hands over
  his latch-key and principles to the first fluffy chorus girl who tells him
  the story of her sad life. Look out for your Elsa, my boy. Is he rich?"</p>

  <p>"Beyond the dreams of actresses," said Ralph cynically. She gazed moodily
  into the fire, and then:</p>

  <p>"Are you rich, Ralph?"</p>

  <p>He looked down at her quickly.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"That's not a particularly difficult question to answer, is it?" she asked
  impatiently. "Are you rich?"</p>

  <p>"Not so rich as I shall be," said Ralph softly. "In a week's time I hope
  to be one million one hundred and seventy-four thousand dollars richer than I
  am to-day."</p>

  <p>That was the amount that had been pencilled on the little memorandum he
  had found in Tarn's safe. And the money was somewhere. He had a shrewd idea
  that, given the opportunity for making a careful examination of Paul Amery's
  study, he would have no difficulty in locating the stolen property.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hallam made no comment, and they sat in silence until she threw the
  end of the cigarette into the fire.</p>

  <p>"You're an optimist, both in love and finance," she said; "and I've an
  idea that it is going to be more trouble to get that girl than it is to get
  the money. What does 'Pace' mean, Ralph?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap30"
     id="chap30">XXX. A LETTER TO KEEP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ELSA slept more soundly than she had done in weeks, and felt
  almost reconciled to her stay when she was summoned to the pretty little
  dining-room to eat a solitary breakfast. Mrs. Hallam had warned her that she
  did not rise before midday, and the girl was by no means sorry to have her
  own company for breakfast. The flats were service apartments: cleaners came
  when summoned, meals were procured from the kitchen in the basement, and Mrs.
  Hallam's one maid was quite sufficient to serve the needs of this economical
  lady.</p>

  <p>Major Amery had not arrived at the office when Elsa took the cover off her
  typewriter, and he did not come in until nearly eleven o'clock. Ordinarily,
  he went straight to his own bureau through the private door, but on this
  occasion he came through her office and, glancing up to bid him good-morning,
  she thought he looked unusually tired and haggard.</p>

  <p>"Morning," he said gruffly, before he disappeared into his room, slamming
  the door behind him.</p>

  <p>A few minutes after, Feng Ho came in, greeting her with his typical
  grin.</p>

  <p>"Has Mister Major Amery arrived?" he asked, dropping his voice when she
  answered. "Nocturnal peregrinations produce morning tardiness," he added.</p>

  <p>Something in his face attracted her attention.</p>

  <p>"You look as if you've had nocturnal peregrinations yourself, Feng Ho,"
  she said, for she noticed the deep lines under his eyes.</p>

  <p>"As a bachelor of science I consume unlimited midnight oil," he said
  calmly, "first placing Pi in a condition of obfuscation."</p>

  <p>"What on earth is that?" she asked, startled.</p>

  <p>"In a dark room," said Feng Ho, "where the actinic rays cannot delude into
  a similitude of daylight and create singings when silence is desirable."</p>

  <p>He looked anxiously at the door of Amery's room.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to see the Major?"</p>

  <p>"No, miss," he said hastily, "not until contemplation has eradicated
  suspicion of a fantastical imaginativeness."</p>

  <p>She detected an uneasiness in his manner which was unusual in this serene
  man, whose calm no circumstances had ever ruffled to her knowledge. She had
  noticed before that Feng Ho's agitation was invariably betrayed by his
  speech. In normal moments his English was unimpeachable; it was only when he
  was perturbed that he disdained simple language, and expressed his thoughts
  in words of four syllables.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will see him," he said suddenly. "Grasping nettles firmly destroys
  virulence of poison stings."</p>

  <p>And before she realized what he was doing, he had tapped at and opened the
  door, slipping through and dosing it behind him. Listening, she heard Amery's
  sharp voice raised almost in anger. He was speaking in Chinese (she guessed
  this) and she heard the murmur of Feng Ho's reply. Presently the voices were
  lost in the clatter of her typewriter, for Elsa was not by nature curious,
  and whilst she could wonder what the Chinaman had done to annoy her irascible
  employer, she was not especially anxious to know.</p>

  <p>It was fully half an hour before Feng Ho came out, his face beaming, and,
  with a wriggling little bow, disappeared to his own den. The bell rang, and
  she took her book into the sanctum, to find Major Amery sitting on the fender
  seat, his chin on his breast, a dejected and dispirited-looking figure. He
  looked up sharply as she entered, fixed her for a moment with his steely
  eyes, and then:</p>

  <p>"I think you'd better stay on at Mrs. Hallam's," he said. "She's a
  kleptomaniac, but she won't steal anything from you."</p>

  <p>"Major Amery!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"I want to say nothing against the woman," he continued, unmindful of her
  amazement and indignation. "She'll let you stay there as long as you want. If
  I were you, I'd get my traps and settle down for a week or two, at any rate.
  After that, nothing matters."</p>

  <p>"I really don't understand you. Mrs. Trene Hallam has been very
  kind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted her with an impatient gesture.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Hallam you can forget; she's just&mdash;nothing. Ralph&mdash;I don't
  think you need worry about Ralph either."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Hallam is a great friend, and a very old friend of mine," she said,
  with what, she felt, was a ludicrous attempt to stand on her dignity.</p>

  <p>His tired eyes were searching her face.</p>

  <p>"A very great friend? Of course... a very great friend. Still&mdash;you
  need not worry about Ralph." Then, abruptly: "I want you to do something for
  me."</p>

  <p>She waited, as he walked to the desk, took out a sheet of paper and began
  to write rapidly. Seven, eight, nine lines of writing she counted, then he
  signed his name with a flourish, blotted the sheet and enclosed it in an
  envelope, the flap of which he covered with a wafer seal. She saw him write a
  name on the envelope, and when he had blotted this he handed the letter to
  her. To her amazement it was addressed to "Dr. Ralph Hallam," and was marked
  "Private."</p>

  <p>"I want you to keep this letter. Have it where you can reach it at any
  hour of the day or night," he said, speaking rapidly, "Hallam may not be as
  bad as I think he is, but if he is any better I am a greatly mistaken
  man."</p>

  <p>"What am I to do with the letter?" she asked blankly.</p>

  <p>"Keep it to your hand," he said, with a touch of his old irritability. "If
  Hallam gets... difficult, if any situation arises which you find impossible
  to handle... give him this letter."</p>

  <p>"But, Major Amery, I really don't know what you're talking about. What
  situation can arise?" she said, holding the letter irresolutely, looking from
  him to the scrawled address.</p>

  <p>"Tuck it away in your handbag by day and under your pillow by night. If
  Hallam ever forgets what is due to him... let me put it clearly: if you are
  ever afraid of him, give him the letter."</p>

  <p>She shook her head smilingly and held the envelope toward him. "I shan't
  require this," she said. "I tell you, Dr. Hallam and I are very old friends.
  He was a friend of poor Mr. Tarn's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I asked you to do something for me," he interrupted her sharply, "and
  that is all I want you to do. I am not in the habit of asking favours, but
  I'll break my practice and ask this: keep the letter and use it if an
  emergency arises. Will you do this?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated, and then: "I think it is very unnecessary and highly
  mysterious," she smiled in spite of herself; "but if you wish me to do it, I
  will."</p>

  <p>"Good," he said briskly. "Now we will initiate a business-like
  correspondence with our American friends of the Cleveland Police
  Department&mdash;I am anxious to know something about a gentleman who is at
  the moment in durance. Take this:</p>

  <p>"To John L. Territet, Chief of Police, Cleveland, Ohio.</p>

  <p>"SIR,</p>

  <p>"Yesterday I cabled asking you if you would kindly inform me whether the
  man Philip Moropoulos&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She looked up in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I thought I knew the name! He was a man arrested in connection with the
  drug traffic. I read it in the newspapers."</p>

  <p>He nodded, and went on:</p>

  <p>"...whether the man Philip Moropoulos, now under arrest in your city, is
  known to have any English alias. For a special reason I am trying to identify
  him with a man named&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There came a tap at the door. It was a girl clerk from the lower office,
  and she held a cablegram in her hand. Elsa took it and passed it across the
  table to Amery.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" he said, and tore it open. "That is a coincidence. You needn't
  bother about that letter."</p>

  <p>Absent-mindedly he pushed the message across toward her, and she
  read:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">"AMERY CO., LONDON. CHARGE AGAINST MOROPOULOS FELL
  THROUGH. RELEASED AND NOW ON HIS WAY TO ENGLAND."</p><br>

  <p>It was signed "Police Chief."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said Amery again. "Released, is he? That is bad news for
  somebody."</p>

  <p>Elsa did not ask who that "somebody" was, and indeed was surprised that he
  had shown her such unusual confidence, Apparently he realized for the first
  time that he had given her the cable to read, for he almost snatched it
  back.</p>

  <p>"That will do," he said curtly. "I'll ring for you when I want you, which
  won't be for some time."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap31"
     id="chap31">XXXI. A CUSTOMER OF THE BANK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. TUPPERWILL'S house in Grosvenor Place was a model of
  what a banker's establishment should be. From garret to cellar it was a
  pattern of order, neatness, and quiet luxury. It was a house where everything
  went according to schedule, from six o'clock in the morning, when the
  under-housemaid kindled the kitchen fire and stoked the furnace, to
  eleven-thirty, when the butler carefully bolted the front door, locked the
  pantry and turned out the last of the hall lights.</p>

  <p>At any moment Mr. Tupperwill, by consulting a neat typewritten time-table,
  which was invariably kept in the top right-hand drawer of his table, could
  tell exactly what every servant was doing, the condition of every room, and
  the amount of petrol in the tanks of each of his motor-cars. On Thursday
  afternoons at five o'clock Mr. Tupperwill received the exact time from the
  telephone exchange, and, checking his watch to the second, made the round of
  the rooms and wound up and set his innumerable clocks, for the collection of
  clocks was not the least pleasurable of Mr. Tupperwill's hobbies.</p>

  <p>He breakfasted at eight-thirty every morning, on two devilled kidneys, a
  crisp slice of bacon, three pieces of toast and two cups of coffee. He never
  had more and he never had less. When he had breakfasted, he glanced through
  three financial newspapers, folded ready at his elbow, and read <i>The
  Times'</i> financial article. At nine-twenty-five, almost to the minute, he
  went out into the hall, was helped on with his fur-lined coat, and usually
  the half-hour was chiming as he walked down the steps to his waiting car.
  Taking leave of him at the door, his butler was wont to remark that it was a
  cold day, a wet day, or a fine day, according to the meteorological
  conditions; and it was Mr. Tupperwill's practice to agree entirely with all
  that his butler said. It was the only point on which they met as man to man,
  all other items of news than the weather being communicated to Mr. Tupperwill
  by his valet.</p>

  <p>On this particular morning, however, the banker broke his habits by
  ringing for the butler before he had finished his breakfast.</p>

  <p>"Weeks, I am having a party to-night."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Weeks, wondering which particular party was in Mr.
  Tupperwill's mind.</p>

  <p>"There will be four to dinner, including myself. Arrange with one of the
  maids&mdash;a trustworthy maid&mdash;to look after the ladies. My bedroom may
  be used as a retiring room&mdash;yes, I think so," said Mr. Tupperwill
  thoughtfully. "And you will see that such things as ladies may require are
  placed on the dressing-table&mdash;powder and that sort of thing. You will
  consult the housekeeper as to the colour and quality, and purchase whatever
  receptacles are required."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir." said the wondering Mr. Weeks.</p>

  <p>"The dinner had better be a little more elaborate than usual," the banker
  went on. "Soup&mdash;Julienne, I think; sole mornay; poulet a la reine; a
  bombed glace and a savoury; I think that will be excellent. A good champagne
  and a light German wine for the ladies&mdash;that also will be
  admirable."</p>

  <p>"At what hour sir?"</p>

  <p>"At half-past eight. Have a bridge table placed in the drawing-room." He
  gave a few other minor instructions and went to the bank five minutes
  late.</p>

  <p>Though by nature lethargic, he spent a very busy morning, for, like Major
  Amery, he opened and usually answered all letters addressed to himself, and
  seldom requisitioned the services of the anaemic young woman who acted as his
  secretary.</p>

  <p>The business of Stebbing's Bank was, as has already been explained, a
  peculiar one. Many of the names of Stebbing's clients were unknown, even to
  the nearest and dearest of their possessors. Great merchants, and small
  merchants for the matter of that, professional men, and even the leading
  lights of other banks, found it extremely convenient to have an account which
  was not identifiable with their better-known names.</p>

  <p>Often it was the case that there was nothing discreditable in this desire
  for anonymity. A reluctance to let the right hand know what the left hand
  does belongs to no class and to no age. Curious income-tax officials might
  see the books of Stebbings and be baffled. Inquisitive busybodies, wondering
  who was behind certain theatrical productions, might discover the name of the
  gentleman who drew the cheques that paid all the salaries, when the
  box-office failed to supply the needful, and yet hardly guess that the plain
  "T. Smith" that appeared in the south-east corner of the cheque, disguised
  the identity of a merchant who would never be suspected of such
  frivolity.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill was the repository of many secrets; and if his bank
  suffered any disadvantage from the possession of so many anonymous clients,
  it was that current accounts offered a conservative banker very few
  opportunities for building up big profits. Nevertheless, Tupperwill had his
  share of general banking business, his pickings of short time loans, his
  discounts and the other "makings" which add to a banker's revenue.</p>

  <p>Usually, he was so engrossed between the hours of a quarter to ten and
  half-past one, that he did not see visitors except upon the most urgent
  business. So that when his elderly accountant appeared in the doorway with a
  card in his hand, Mr. Tupperwill frowned and waved his hand in protest.</p>

  <p>"Not now, my dear man, not now," he said reproachfully. "I really can't
  see anybody. Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"The account that was closed yesterday," said the accountant.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill sat bolt upright.</p>

  <p>"Amery?" he asked in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. He said he wouldn't keep you more than ten minutes."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill pushed back the table lamp by which he had been
  working&mdash;he was rather short-sighted&mdash;thrust some papers into a
  leather folder, and only then took the card and stared at it as though he
  could read on its conventional surface some answer to the enigma which this
  call of Major Amery presented.</p>

  <p>"Ask him to come in," he said in a hushed voice, and put the Louis Quinze
  chair in its place.</p>

  <p>Amery walked into the room and was received with just that amount of
  deference and distant courtesy which his position as an ex-client of the bank
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"I have called because I felt that some explanation was due to you, Mr.
  Tupperwill. I closed my account with you yesterday."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill nodded seriously.</p>

  <p>"It was reported to me," he said, "and I must confess that I was both
  surprised and&mdash;relieved."</p>

  <p>A faint smile played about the hard lips of the man from India. "Your
  relief being due to the unsatisfactory character of the client, rather than
  the nature of the account, which was a fairly heavy one?"</p>

  <p>"It was a fairly heavy one," agreed Mr. Tupperwill, "but it was, if you
  will allow me the observation, mysterious."</p>

  <p>"Are not all your accounts mysterious?" asked Amery coldly, to which the
  banker made no reply.</p>

  <p>"I could not escape the feeling," he said instead, "that you were using
  Stebbing's as a&mdash;a makeshift. I am sure you will forgive me if I am in
  error. But the impermanence of your account was one of its unsatisfactory
  features."</p>

  <p>"It was intended to be permanent," said Amery coolly. "I will make a
  confession to you&mdash;that I opened my account with Stebbing's for a
  special purpose. I will be even more frank and tell you that it was my
  intention to engineer an irregularity which would have given me the right to
  go to the courts for an examination of your books."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill gasped at this monstrous confession.</p>

  <p>"I now know that such a course would have been futile. In fact, I knew
  less about banking than I thought."</p>

  <p>"You wanted to examine my books?" said Mr. Tupperwill slowly, as the
  hideous nature of the plot began to penetrate. "I've never heard anything
  like it!"</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you have. But, you see, Mr. Tupperwill, you live a very
  sheltered life," said the other. "As I say, when I found that the scheme I
  had at the back of my mind was impracticable, and moreover, discovered on the
  same day all that I wanted to know, I removed my account. Tupperwill, who is
  John Stillman?"</p>

  <p>Paul Amery had a fatal facility for making people jump. Mr. Tupperwill
  almost leapt from his chair at the words.</p>

  <p>"Stillman?" he stammered. "I&mdash;I don't understand you."</p>

  <p>"Nobody understands me, probably because I speak too plainly," said Amery.
  "You carry the account of a man named Stillman; a bigger account than mine,
  and a much more dangerous one. Stebbing's Bank would survive having me on its
  list of clients, but Stillman's is one that will tumble you, your fortune and
  your bank into mud so thick that it will choke you!"</p>

  <p>For a second the banker stared at him in horror, and then: "I refuse, I
  absolutely refuse to discuss the business of the bank," he said, bringing his
  hand down on the table with a crash. "It is disgraceful... unbusinesslike...
  how dare you, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Amery silenced him with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"It may be all the things you say, but I tell you that Stillman, unless I
  am greatly mistaken in his identity, is more deadly than a snake."</p>

  <p>"I refuse to discuss the matter," said Mr. Tupperwill furiously, as he
  pressed his bell. "You are talking about a lady, sir; a very charming lady,
  sir; a lady who, although she occupies an humble position in your office in
  the City, is nevertheless entitled to my respect, my admiration and my
  homage, sir."</p>

  <p>Amery looked at him aghast.</p>

  <p>"A lady?" he said incredulously. "In the City, in my office? Good
  God!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap32"
     id="chap32">XXXII. THE SPECULATOR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JOHN STILLMAN, the mystery client of Stebbing's Bank, was
  Elsa Marlowe! The sinister man could only gaze, speechless, at the red-faced
  banker. Maurice Tarn's niece! Was she in it, after all?</p>

  <p>"You are speaking of Miss Marlowe, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"I am speaking of nobody, sir." Mr. Tupperwill was hoarse with anger. "You
  have asked me to betray a sacred confidence: I shall never forgive you."</p>

  <p>The accountant was in the room now.</p>

  <p>"Show Major Amery from these premises, and under no circumstances is he to
  be admitted again!"</p>

  <p>Amery was still looking down at him.</p>

  <p>"Either you have been grossly deceived and tricked, or else you're lying,
  Tupperwill," he said. "Miss Marlowe has no account with your bank, either in
  her own or anybody else's name."</p>

  <p>"I decline, I absolutely decline, to speak another word. There is the
  door, sir."</p>

  <p>The visitor was about to say something, but checked himself, and, turning
  on his heel, walked out.</p>

  <p>For a quarter of an hour Mr Tupperwill sat simmering in his rage, and at
  the end of that time had sufficiently recovered to ring for his
  accountant.</p>

  <p>"Bring Mr. Stillman's account," he said sharply.</p>

  <p>"I was going to speak to you about that, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then don't!" snarled the ruffled banker. "Bring me the account."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, a book was placed before him and opened, and by this
  time he was something of his urbane self.</p>

  <p>"You must forgive my&mdash;er&mdash;petulance, but Major Amery annoyed me;
  he annoyed me very much."</p>

  <p>He looked at the page before him, and his face fell.</p>

  <p>"He's not overdrawn," he said.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he's not overdrawn, but that is all one can say. His
  speculations have been colossal. Look at these." He ran his finger down a
  column of figures. "They're all broker's cheques. He has been dealing in
  Angora Oil: we carried a whole lot of the stock for him, but it fell from
  fifty-seven to thirteen in a week. I was going to ask you to see Mr.
  Stillman."</p>

  <p>"Never seen him yourself?" asked the banker without looking up.</p>

  <p>"No, sir; the account was opened with you, and I don't remember that the
  client has ever been to the bank. I always thought that the cheque signatures
  looked like a lady's."</p>

  <p>"That will do, that will do, Thomas," said Mr. Tupperwill testily. "I will
  write to Mr. Stillman myself. So far as I can see, he has lost considerably
  over a quarter of a million this half-year."</p>

  <p>He closed the book with a bang and waved it away.</p>

  <p>A quarter of a million, he thought with a sense of dismay, and thrown into
  the gutter!</p>

  <p>To Mr. Tupperwill, capital was a living thing, and that it could be
  treated cruelly pained him. A quarter of a million mangled and tortured into
  nothingness! The thought was frightful. He reached for a sheet of paper and
  began a letter. Half way through he read it over with an expression of
  dissatisfaction, and, carrying it to the fireplace, lit a match and watched
  the paper burn into curling black ashes. He did no more work that day: he was
  too occupied with his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Toward four o'clock he rang for his accountant.</p>

  <p>"I am worried, terribly worried, about Stillman's account," he said. "The
  truth is&mdash;er&mdash;unless I have been grossly deceived, Stillman is a
  pseudonym (from the Greek 'pseudo,' meaning false) for a young lady who was
  introduced to the bank some years ago, on the assurance that she had
  inherited a large sum of money."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, sir?" said the accountant, whom nothing surprised. "A lady of
  title?"</p>

  <p>"No, not a lady of title," said Mr. Tupperwill uncomfortably. "In fact,
  she holds quite a subordinate&mdash;er&mdash;position in a London business
  house. I understood that she was fitting herself for a commercial career and
  starting, as it were, at the bottom of the ladder. I need not tell you that I
  deprecate the incursion of the gentler sex into the sordid struggle of
  commerce, but that is neither here nor there."</p>

  <p>"What am I to do if further cheques come in?" asked the accountant,
  practically. "Mr. or Miss Stillman has only the barest balance."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill looked up at the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"I think I should honour the cheques," he said softly. "Yes, I think I
  should honour them. Unless, of course, they are for a large sum&mdash;an
  excessive sum."</p>

  <p>"I wanted to know, sir," said the accountant, "because I've just had a
  cheque in for twenty-five thousand pounds, drawn by Stillman, and there's
  less than fifty to meet it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill went very pale.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap33"
     id="chap33">XXXIII. STAYING ON</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IF, obeying his bell, Elsa Marlowe had entered the room of
  the sinister man and found him standing on his head, she felt she would not
  have been surprised. He was guilty of such extraordinary behaviour that she
  felt she was beyond amazement, and was almost resigned even to his
  impertinent interest in her affairs.</p>

  <p>Although several times she was on the point of destroying the letter which
  he had thrust upon her, she was checked on each occasion by a feeling that in
  doing so she would be acting disloyally to one who, she was quite certain,
  had no ill will toward her. That he might be using her for his own purpose,
  playing her off against Ralph Hallam, she thought was more than possible. But
  since his revelation, her feelings had changed entirely toward her sometime
  friend. Even now she could not grasp the extent of Hallam's offence.
  Occasionally she had read in the newspapers stories of "dope fiends," but the
  practice had only an academic interest for her. She thought it was
  unpleasant, and that was all, for she had never been brought into contact
  with the victims of this vice, and her imagination was of that healthy type
  which did not dwell upon morbidities.</p>

  <p>But though she was ready to endure much, Major Amery's conduct that
  afternoon was especially trying. Nothing seemed to please him. He snapped and
  snarled like an angry dog, exploded violently and with the least excuse, and
  raged through the offices, major and minor, like a devastating wind, leaving
  elderly sub-managers dazed and breathless, and junior clerks on the point of
  mutiny.</p>

  <p>"He reminds me," said Miss Dame, in a tremble of wrath, "of one of those
  bullying head cowboys who go around making up to the boss's daughter, and are
  always punching people or shooting them, till the handsome young fellow
  arrives that has had a row with his father who's a millionaire, and he comes
  in and throws a glass of rum in the head cowboy's face&mdash;from what I read
  in the papers, they've got more rum than they know what to do with over
  there&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And what has he been doing to you?" asked Elsa good humouredly.</p>

  <p>"What hasn't he been doing?" asked the wrathful young lady. "A bullying,
  hectoring hound, that's what he is, a bullying hectoring hound! I'd like my
  pater to say a few words to him. My pater would just look at him and he'd
  curl up."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure your father wouldn't curl up," said Elsa, wilfully dense.</p>

  <p>"I don't mean pater, I mean that woman-worrying vampire! Which reminds me,
  Miss Marlowe&mdash;when are you coming home to have a cup of tea? You haven't
  seen our new house."</p>

  <p>Here was an invitation which Elsa had most successfully evaded for a long
  time.</p>

  <p>"Some day," she said vaguely.</p>

  <p>"Of course, we're not your style," said Miss Dame, "but father's a perfect
  gentleman, and you wouldn't see a nicer houseful of furniture in the West End
  of London."</p>

  <p>Elsa laughed.</p>

  <p>"I shan't come to see your furniture, Jessie. Honestly, I'll come just as
  soon as I can. This dreadful inquest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I understand perfectly, my dear," said Miss Dame, with a tragic look of
  melancholy. "I know just how you feel. I've seen Pearl Winsome that way
  often. And as to his nibs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A faint sound in the next room, which might have been the creak of a
  chair, or the tap of a paper-knife against an inkstand, was sufficient to
  send Miss Dame into hasty retreat.</p>

  <p>Elsa was dismissed that afternoon nearly an hour earlier than usual, and
  she was glad of the extra time, for she wanted to call at the hotel to get
  her trunks and the little instrument that had given her so much pleasure in
  the days when she was glad to get away from Maurice Tarn and the everlasting
  scent of brandy, and catch from the ether the mystery music that came from
  nowhere, and was miraculously caught on the silk-covered wires of her small
  frame aerial.</p>

  <p>Between the hotel, where she recovered her belongings, and Herbert
  Mansions, it came to her that a few hours before she had not the slightest
  intention of remaining the guest of Mrs. Trene Hallam a day longer than was
  necessary. Yet here she was, with her box on top of a taxicab, en route to
  her home, content to extend her visit for an indefinite period! She did not
  ask herself the reason for this change of mind: only too well she knew. Major
  Paul Amery had settled the matter in two sentences. She was almost resigned
  to his tyrannical will.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hallam watched the erection of the wireless apparatus with more
  interest than enthusiasm, and seemed relieved when the girl told her that she
  intended keeping the strange contraption in her bedroom.</p>

  <p>"It looks dangerous to me," said Mrs. Hallam decisively. "All those wires
  and electricity and things... I should hate to have it around... how does it
  work?"</p>

  <p>But here Elsa was in no better position than the average devotee of
  wireless.</p>

  <p>"You're coming to stay then?" asked Lou, as the girl was fixing the
  terminals. There was no great encouragement in her tone.</p>

  <p>"You asked me to stay a month," said Elsa, a little uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"As long as you like, my dear," and the lady's attempt to enthuse some
  warmth into the invitation was not wholly successful.</p>

  <p>Deep down inside her, Mrs. Hallam was annoyed. She hated strangers, and
  was by no means impressed with one of whom she thought as "Ralph's latest."
  That she was pretty she was ready to confess, but it was not the kind of
  prettiness which Mrs. Hallam favoured. In Elsa she found no spiritual
  affinity, though she did not exactly describe her failure in those words,
  even to herself.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'll spend a lot of your time listening to this thing?" she
  asked hopefully, and, when Elsa nodded, Mrs. Hallam took a kindlier interest
  in the apparatus. Elsa explained the character of the programmes.</p>

  <p>"Opera!" said Mrs Hallam, making a little face. "Opera's all right, but
  the singing spoils it. I suppose you're looking forward to meeting old
  what's-his-name again?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tupperwill?" smiled Elsa. "No, not very much."</p>

  <p>"You don't like him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't dislike him. He seems a very pleasant old man."</p>

  <p>"You've made a hit with him, anyway," said the lady brusquely, "and he's
  got stacks of money. I suppose he's clever, but from my point of view he'd
  make the Dead Sea look like a soda fountain. I hate that kind of man, who
  talks about the things you expect him to talk about."</p>

  <p>"Then you must like Major Amery?" said Elsa.</p>

  <p>A faint tinge of colour came to Mrs. Hallam's face, and she shivered.</p>

  <p>"When that man dies, I'll go into white," she said viciously. So many
  people hated the sinister man, thought Elsa, as she finished her unpacking
  alone. The realization that "so many people" did not include herself came to
  her in the nature of a shock.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap34"
     id="chap34">XXXIV. THE GENTLEMAN FROM CLEVELAND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a conference at Scotland Yard, and outside that
  quaint "informants' door," where shabby men come creeping in the dusk of
  evening to tell stories to the hurt of those who have mistakenly given them
  their confidence, two officers were waiting to escort a man who had not yet
  arrived.</p>

  <p>Sir James Boyd Fowler, Chief Commissioner of the C.I.D., had in his office
  his superintendent and a detective inspector. The hour was short of five, and
  from time to time Mr. Bickerson looked up at the clock impatiently.</p>

  <p>"They ought to be here in a few minutes now," said Superintendent Wille,
  following the direction of the other's eye. "Do you expect this fellow to
  give you much information, Bickerson?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," nodded Bickerson. "He was in London three months before his
  arrest, and I have reason to believe that he was in very close touch with the
  amateurs, and possibly with Soyoka's crowd."</p>

  <p>"Will he squeal?" grunted Sir James. "That's the question: will he squeal?
  In four days I've had three letters from the Secretary of State, asking for
  an encouraging report. Up to date we've had nothing. You're satisfied that
  Amery is the pea?"</p>

  <p>"I was never more sure of anything," replied Bickerson promptly.</p>

  <p>Sir James growled something under his breath. He was by nature an
  intolerant man, and his irascibility was considerably accentuated by the
  annoyance he was receiving from men higher up.</p>

  <p>"Did Soyoka kill Tarn? Do you suggest Amery was in that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I suggest that if Amery wasn't in it, he was behind it. Every thing
  points to his being our man. His history is enough to damn him. Thrown out of
  the political service for trafficking in opium, he's either Soyoka or, what
  is more likely, the real head of the amateurs."</p>

  <p>"But you said Hallam was that?" interrupted the superintendent.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure Hallam is in it up to his neck&mdash;equally sure that, if Major
  Paul Amery is the big boss, Hallam is in total ignorance of the fact. But
  that is the way these gangs are worked; there's always somebody right on top,
  pulling all the strings, directing most of the operations, financing every
  deal and clearing the proceeds; and there's somebody lower down, under the
  impression that he's the fellow that's doing it all. Amery is a trafficker in
  drugs, as slippery as an eel and as cunning as the devil."</p>

  <p>"Did you have much trouble in getting Moropoulos over, sir?" asked the
  superintendent.</p>

  <p>"None whatever. The case against him was too thin, and the district
  attorney decided not to go on with it. The Cleveland police were in cable
  communication with me, and I had the inspiration to consult Bickerson and
  cable for the man to be brought over&mdash;he's under escort of a Cleveland
  detective, by the way. I think he'll talk; from the description I've had of
  him, he seems that kind. And if he talks, I'm going to put these people where
  I want them. Here's your man."</p>

  <p>A uniformed constable hurried across the room and laid a slip before the
  Commissioner.</p>

  <p>"That is he," he said. "Bring him in."</p>

  <p>He returned escorting three men, one of whom was a Scotland Yard officer;
  the second, tall and lean-faced, was evidently the American detective, and
  the third of the party, a stout and rosy individual, who bore no sort of
  resemblance at all to a hardened criminal. He looked to be what he
  undoubtedly had been, the fairly prosperous proprietor of a small store; and
  though he was a Greek, his voice, showed no indication of foreign birth. He
  bowed genially to the chief, and accepted the chair which Bickerson pushed up
  for him with a polite little murmur of protest.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I am Moropoulos. This gentleman is the chief?" He nodded to Sir
  James. "Yeh, I thought so. Now I'm going to tell you gentlemen, before we go
  any further, that there's no squeal coming from me. I've come to Europe
  because the chief at Cleveland advised me that if I could make myself useful
  to you, there was a chance of the police on our side dropping the case. Not
  that they had one, I guess, but that's a matter of opinion. The living I'll
  not talk about; the dead"&mdash;he emphasized the word&mdash;"why, I'm ready
  to say just as much about them as I think is decent. Now, Captain,
  shoot!"</p>

  <p>"By the dead, I suppose you mean Maurice Tarn?"</p>

  <p>Moropoulos nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I mean Maurice Tarn. I don't know whether he was the big guy,
  but he was certainly one of them. I had dealings with him; I brought a whole
  lot of cocaine over from Germany in a specially made box. I guess you found
  it when you searched his lodgings. It had five wooden trays, one on top of
  the other&mdash;that's what you call them over here, isn't it, 'trays'?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't see that," said Bickerson thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Maybe he burnt it. I'm only just telling you that I brought the box over
  for him, and I had a long talk with him before I left."</p>

  <p>"Did he say anything to you about Soyoka's gang?"</p>

  <p>A shadow passed over the pleasant face of the Greek.</p>

  <p>"No, sir!" he said emphatically. "It was Soyoka who got me pinched. One of
  the bulls tipped me off. He said I was invading the territory of his man,
  which is a lie, for I was the only guy working the stuff on a big scale in
  Ohio."</p>

  <p>"Did you get any hint who this man was?" asked Bickerson.</p>

  <p>"He's somebody big in London. An officer&mdash;he's got a rank, I
  guess."</p>

  <p>"You've never heard the name?" asked Sir James. "It wasn't by any chance
  Major Amery?"</p>

  <p>"Amery?" repeated the Greek slowly. "Well, I wouldn't just swear to it.
  All I know is that he was mad at me, and one of his people came along and
  squealed. Oh, yes," he added frankly, "I had the stuff all right! But they
  didn't catch me with it. That's where their case broke down. When they raided
  my parlour they didn't find anything more intoxicating than a bottle of
  tomato ketchup!"</p>

  <p>"Did Tarn have any confederates? You must know that, Moropoulos?" asked
  Sir James.</p>

  <p>"I make a pretty fair distinction between the living and the dead. If any
  of his friends have died, maybe you'll produce their death certificates and
  I'll start talking. Otherwise&mdash;" he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner and Bickerson exchanged a few words in a low voice, and
  then the American detective was beckoned forward.</p>

  <p>"You're not holding this man, officer, are you?"</p>

  <p>The American shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. So far as I am concerned, he is as free as the air; I've only
  come over as a sort of chaperon."</p>

  <p>"It's true, then, what he says?" asked the Commissioner in an undertone.
  "The case against him has been dropped?"</p>

  <p>The officer from Cleveland nodded again.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. He was a little too quick for us. We thought we'd caught him
  with the stuff, but we came about five minutes too late."</p>

  <p>It was Bickerson who took charge of the Greek, escorting him to the
  smartest restaurant within walking distance.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the Greek, "it's never too early for supper for a hungry
  man&mdash;or dinner, just what you call it so long as it's food. That journey
  from Liverpool was certainly the hungriest thousand miles I've ever
  travelled. Two hundred, is it? It seemed longer."</p>

  <p>"I've taken a room for you at one of our best hotels," said Bickerson,
  when they had found a table and a waiter. "And if you're short of money, you
  must let me know. We should like to make your stay in town as pleasant as
  possible."</p>

  <p>Moropoulos shook his head, a gleam of reproach in his eyes. "Listen,
  baby," he said gently; "they do that much better on our side. Say, they're
  artists! They'd deceive me! You haven't got into that way, I guess. It comes
  naturally awkward, trying to be my only friend in the great city. I'll pay
  for this lunch, Bill, just so I can have the satisfaction of telling you that
  you've heard all the squeal that's likely to pass my lips during my absence
  from home."</p>

  <p>Bickerson laughed, though he was not in a laughing humour.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing we want from you," he said untruthfully. "In fact, I
  don't know that you could add to our information. Hallam we know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who's Hallam?" asked the other, in bland surprise. "He's half-brother to
  Stillman, I guess."</p>

  <p>"Stillman!"</p>

  <p>The Greek was obviously tickled at the effect the word had produced.</p>

  <p>"I thought that would get you. A new one on you?"</p>

  <p>"It's certainly a new one on me," said Bickerson, recovering from his
  surprise. "Who is Stillman?"</p>

  <p>The Greek took some time to consider the question, and when he answered he
  sounded a very definite note.</p>

  <p>"Stillman I don't know and have never seen. All I know I got from one of
  Soyoka's crowd that I used to run with in New York. Stillman is one of their
  top men, but I guess that isn't half his name. And now I'm through answering
  questions."</p>

  <p>Bickerson was wise enough to drop the question of the dope gangs until the
  hungry man had finished his supper. But neither the production of the
  choicest wine, nor the discovery of the most piquant liqueur, caused the
  Greek to grow any more loquacious. Bickerson escorted him to his hotel, and
  then went on to call at Ralph Hallam's house.</p>

  <p>As the detective put his hand on the bell, Ralph himself opened the door.
  He was in evening dress.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he said, a little wearily. "Have you come to see that
  prescription book?"</p>

  <p>"Forget it," said Bickerson amiably. "No, Hallam, I've dropped in to make
  a final call, and then maybe you and I will never meet, except
  professionally, in a hundred years."</p>

  <p>And, seeing the look of dubiety in the other's face, he roared with
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"When I say 'professionally,' I mean as a doctor and patient," he said.
  "Can you give me a minute?"</p>

  <p>"Come in," said Ralph ungraciously, and led the way into his dining-
  room.</p>

  <p>"Now this is what I want to know from you. You have a pretty good idea of
  old man Tarn's possessions. Do you remember his having a box with five
  trays?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Ralph promptly&mdash;too promptly. The detective viewed him
  with suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Now listen, doctor, there's nothing against you, even if you were a
  friend of Tarn's and he was a dope runner&mdash;as you know he was. Can't you
  help a fellow with a morsel of information?"</p>

  <p>"If I knew I wouldn't tell you. What is wrong with the box?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing: it had a false bottom, that's all. And I'm wondering whether the
  old man might have concealed something..."</p>

  <p>He saw a sudden change come over Ralph Hallam's face; his eyes had grown
  bright with suppressed excitement.</p>

  <p>"You're thinking of something pleasant?" said the keen detective, and
  Ralph nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very pleasant!" he said.</p>

  <p>He was thinking of a million dollars.</p>

  <p>Suppose it were true? Suppose Tupperwill were mistaken? And suppose the
  money that he saw in Amery's box were really and rightfully the property of
  the sinister man? And suppose that, in his queer, secretive way, Tarn had
  taken the money back to the house and had hidden it? Elsa would know where
  the box was, he thought, as his car carried him toward Herbert Mansions. The
  balance of probability was that the money was in Amery's possession or at his
  bank; but there was just that chance, faint and barely possible, but
  possible. The very thought made him grow hot and cold.</p>

  <p>Elsa was in her room when he arrived.</p>

  <p>"That lady is certainly a bright companion for me," said his wife
  ironically. "She sits in her bedroom half the night, with those 'hub' things
  in her ears. What is going to happen now?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Ralph, "except that we dine with Tupperwill."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hallam groaned.</p>

  <p>"What morgue does he live at?" she asked. "Ralph, boy, I've given up two
  dances for you&mdash;real jazzy ones."</p>

  <p>"Go and call the girl," said Ralph, whose patience in his wife's presence
  was never far from the breaking point.</p>

  <p>Elsa saved her hostess the trouble. She was walking down the passage when
  Mrs. Hallam emerged from the drawing-room, a dainty figure in the new gown
  she was wearing in honour of the occasion, though she thought it was very
  dreadful going out at all, and said so.</p>

  <p>"You're thinking of Tarn?" said Ralph slowly. "Well, he wasn't so close a
  relative that it need send you into mourning. You look tired," he added
  sympathetically. "Have you had a bad day with the ogre?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. Mrs. Hallam had left them alone for a moment, and it
  was an opportunity not to be lost.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you remember, Elsa, whether your uncle had a trunk with a
  number of trays, fitting one on top of the other?"</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember it very well, because that particular box is in this
  house," she said.</p>

  <p>For a second his heart leapt, and it required all his willpower to hide
  the excitement under which he was labouring.</p>

  <p>"I packed some of my old clothes in it," she added, and his hopes
  fell.</p>

  <p>"Empty, was it?" he asked carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes, it was empty"&mdash;she hesitated. "At least, the top trays
  were empty. One or two at the bottom I could not lift: I found to-night when
  I was unpacking, that they are screwed to the side of the box, and it struck
  me that there must be something underneath, for the trunk is extraordinarily
  heavy, even when it is empty. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"There is no especial reason," he replied carelessly, "except that I took
  a fancy to the old case when I saw it, and your uncle told me that, if I
  wanted it, he would give it to me."</p>

  <p>"You can have it," she smiled, "but you must find me another to take its
  place."</p>

  <p>Then and there he would have cancelled the dinner party and taken the box
  to Half Moon Street, but it was inadvisable to show so much eagerness, and
  Mrs. Hallam returning at that moment, the subject dropped. A little later,
  just before they left the house, he found time to utter a warning.</p>

  <p>"Don't attempt to unscrew the bottom trays," he said, in a voice low
  enough to evade his wife. "I have an idea there is something there which
  &mdash;well, frankly, should not be there."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean drugs?" she said quickly.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hallam's impatient voice called them from the corridor. "Are you
  coming?" she snapped, and the girl hurried to join her.</p>

  <p>"This evening is going to be so entirely wasted," complained Mrs. Hallam,
  when they were in the car, "that I'd just as soon have chloroform right
  away!"</p>

  <p>To Mr. Tupperwill, superintending the finishing touches of his little
  feast, the night was to be one of peculiar significance. He fussed from
  drawing-room to dining-room; he went up to his own apartment and solemnly
  surveyed the etceteras which a knowledgeable housekeeper had produced, and
  which ranged from lip-sticks to cold cream; and whilst he felt that many of
  these acquisitions were unlikely to be of more service than a first-aid
  outfit, he had the satisfaction of knowing that nothing had been left undone
  for the entertainment of his guests.</p>

  <p>A trim maid showed the two women into the room, and Mrs. Hallam inspected
  the appointments with an approving eye.</p>

  <p>"There's a million pounds' worth of furniture here," she said enviously,
  surveying the rare Empire furnishings.</p>

  <p>Her hand, sweeping over the silk-panelled wall in an effort to price the
  quality, stopped at the edge of a heavy golden picture frame, that hung, it
  seemed, a little low. Instantly she divined the reason, and, pushing the
  picture aside, she saw a circular disc of steel sunk in the wall. Was this
  the safe that Mr. Tupperwill had misguidedly spoken about? Those ineradicably
  predatory instincts of hers flamed into life. What was the
  word?&mdash;something to do with "peace"; and yet it wasn't "peace." It was a
  word that meant running&mdash;"pace"!</p>

  <p>In a mirror she caught a glimpse of Elsa, who was taking off her cloak and
  in the act of turning. With a quick movement Lou straightened the picture and
  walked back to the dressing-table, her colour heightened, her heart beating a
  little quicker.</p>

  <p>"Look at all that truck," she drawled, indicating the serried rows of pots
  and dishes on the table. "The poor old fish!"</p>

  <p>Elsa laughed softly. "Poor Mr. Tupperwill! He hasn't been used to
  entertaining women."</p>

  <p>"That's a good sign, anyway," said Lou, and then: "I wonder if he's one of
  those eccentric millionaires that give dinner party presents?"</p>

  <p>Pace! That was the word: she was sure of it now. She could hardly tear
  herself away, but the maid was waiting at the door, and there would be other
  opportunities. Such a man as Tupperwill would in all probability collect all
  manner of valuable trinkets: he seemed that sort of man. And one little piece
  would not be missed. Her passion for easy "findings" was beyond her power to
  combat. She went downstairs to meet the anxious Mr. Tupperwill, resolved to
  carry away at least one souvenir of a very dull evening.</p>

  <p>And a dull evening it proved to be, for the banker was not in his most
  talkative mood, and reverted to the subject of business and its cares so
  frequently that Elsa had all her work to conceal her yawns.</p>

  <p>"I've had a very trying afternoon," said Mr. Tupperwill over the coffee,
  "an extremely anxious afternoon. In fact, I cannot remember an afternoon
  quite as full of unpleasantness. Clients can be very annoying."</p>

  <p>"I always thought your clients were models in that respect?" said
  Ralph.</p>

  <p>He too had been silent throughout the meal, his mind so completely
  occupied by the possibilities that Elsa's old box contained, that he scarcely
  spoke half a dozen times.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they are usually," admitted Mr. Tupperwill; "but this particular
  customer I have in my mind has been&mdash;very&mdash;er
  &mdash;distressing."</p>

  <p>Even he was glad when, at the end of a long-drawn-out rubber of bridge, in
  which Lou cheated shamelessly, the women rose to go upstairs to collect their
  cloaks.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've been extremely boring."</p>

  <p>Ralph murmured something as he strolled out to get his coat and hat from
  the melancholy butler.</p>

  <p>"And I intended this party to be quite cheerful," said Mr. Tupperwill
  miserably. "But my usual vivacity... entirely evaporated... entirely."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure the ladies have enjoyed themselves," soothed Ralph.</p>

  <p>"I hope they have," replied the host, in doubt. "I sincerely hope they
  have."</p>

  <p>Elsa had got her cloak and was leaving the bedroom, when her companion
  stopped.</p>

  <p>"Go down, dear. I won't be a moment." She was stooping over her shoe.
  "This wretched buckle has come undone."</p>

  <p>"Can I help you?"</p>

  <p>"No, don't wait," said the woman impatiently. Her hands were trembling
  with excitement.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had the door closed upon Elsa Marlowe than Mrs. Hallam crossed
  the room, pushed aside the picture, and, with shaking fingers, turned the
  dial, her ears strained for the slightest sound from the corridor. She had a
  small combination safe of her own and knew its working, and in another second
  the door had swung open.</p>

  <p>She caught a glimpse of a number of envelopes; there were two or three
  flat cases; but the only valuable in sight was something which looked like a
  gold cigarette case. She could not afford to wait for a closer search, and,
  slipping the case into her bag, she closed the safe, spun the dial, and
  replacing the picture, was descending the stairs before Elsa had reached the
  bottom.</p>

  <p>She saw Ralph's eyes fixed on her with a steady, enquiring, suspicious
  look. Hallam knew his wife only too well. But she met his eyes boldly, and
  was gushing over her host before Ralph Hallam could decide in his mind the
  inward meaning of her flushed cheeks.</p>

  <p>Tupperwill escorted Elsa to the car; Ralph and the woman followed.</p>

  <p>"You haven't been playing the fool, have you?" he asked under his
  breath.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she demanded in surprise.</p>

  <p>"You didn't find any of Tupperwill's jewellery lying loose? By God! if you
  ever try that with my friends&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're mad," she said angrily. "Do you imagine I would do anything
  so..."</p>

  <p>At that moment they came within earshot of the other two and took their
  farewell.</p>

  <p>"Are you going straight home?" asked Ralph as the car started.</p>

  <p>"Where else?" asked his wife. "Have you any suggestions?"</p>

  <p>"Let us go to the Mispah. We'll have some supper and dancing, and get the
  taste of this funereal evening out of our mouths."</p>

  <p>He looked at Elsa, and the girl hesitated.</p>

  <p>"We needn't go on the dance floor," he said, reading her unwillingness.
  "We can have supper upstairs in the balcony and watch the people," and
  reluctantly she agreed.</p>

  <p>The Mispah, though the least advertised, is the most fashionable of the
  London dance clubs, and the floor was covered with dancers when they picked
  theft way through the crowded balcony to the table he had reserved. The girl,
  to whom this night club life was a novelty, looked, fascinated, at the
  glittering throng that swayed and moved to the staccato pounding of the
  orchestra.</p>

  <p>"This is what Jessie Dame would call Life," she said with a smile. "Poor
  Jessie! Her one ambition is to mingle with a hectic throng, mainly composed
  of sinister men in evening dress, and meet the aristocracy on equal
  terms."</p>

  <p>"A base ambition," said Ralph gaily. "There are not many of the
  aristocracy here, though there are a few. That is Letty Milenko from the
  Gaiety. That tall man is Lord Sterrer. The name of the scarecrow with whom
  he's dancing I don't know, although I've seen her here before."</p>

  <p>Elsa was gazing speechlessly at Lord Sterrer's partner. She was a woman of
  about middle height, painfully thin, and on whom clothes hung loosely. Her
  ears, her throat, her hair glittered with diamonds, and the big hands that
  lay upon the black coat of her partner flashed and scintillated dazzlingly.
  As the face came to view, Elsa saw that her eyes were half closed, and that
  she seemed to be moving in an ecstasy of perfect enjoyment.</p>

  <p>It was the romantic Miss Dame!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap35"
     id="chap35">XXXV. MAJOR AMERY IS SURPRISED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JESSIE DAME! There was no doubt about it, no mistaking her.
  Jessie Dame, flashing with diamonds, expensively garbed, and dancing on the
  most exclusively public floor in London!</p>

  <p>At first she was sure that she was mistaken. And then... no, it was
  Jessie! As the dance finished, the girl looked up, and Elsa drew back out of
  sight.</p>

  <p>"Is she somebody you know?" asked Ralph, who had observed the effect this
  strange spectacle had upon her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know her," said Elsa shortly. "Do you?"</p>

  <p>Ralph shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've seen her here once or twice before. She usually comes with a
  middle-aged man&mdash;there he is."</p>

  <p>He pointed to a corner whither Jessie was making her way, accompanied by
  her partner. The man to whom Ralph pointed was stout and bald, and to
  somewhat coarse features he added a sweeping cavalry moustache, suspiciously
  yellow.</p>

  <p>Jessie! The discovery shocked her. She had never imagined that this gawk
  of a girl, with her foolish chatter of picture heroes and heroines, could
  lead what was tantamount to a double life. Elsa had always thought of her as,
  if not poor, at least one who lived in modest circumstances; yet here she
  was, carrying a small fortune in jewellery, and obviously on terms of
  friendship with people whom Elsa did not imagine she could know.</p>

  <p>She was being snobbish, she told herself. There was no reason in the world
  that Jessie Dame should not dance at the Mispah Club; less reason that this
  doting "pater" of whom she so often spoke, should not cover her with jewels.
  At the same time she felt a strange uneasiness, and could not keep her eyes
  from the girl, whose awkward gestures of animation were visible from where
  she sat.</p>

  <p>Ralph saw that something unusual had happened, but did not for the moment
  connect the girl's changed expression with that raw apparition on the floor
  below. He asked her to dance, and, when she declined, he was promptly claimed
  by Mrs. Hallam.</p>

  <p>"Let me get a dance out of the night, at any rate," she said, and carried
  him off, leaving the girl alone, not to her regret, for the strain of the
  evening was beginning to tell on her.</p>

  <p>She moved her seat so that, whilst free from observation herself, she had
  a good view of Jessie Dame. The band had struck up, the floor was again a
  kaleidoscopic tangle of colours and movement, but Miss Dame, now vigorously
  fanning herself, did not join the throng, and apparently her cavalier had
  left her.</p>

  <p>Elsa took her eyes from the floor and surveyed the other occupants of the
  balcony, and then she uttered an exclamation of surprise. Between two pillars
  was a table at which sat a solitary and detached observer. He was looking at
  her, and, as their eyes met, he rose and came round the corner of the balcony
  toward her, an unusually gracious proceeding on his part; his interest in her
  presence was more unexpected than the actual discovery of Major Amery in this
  gay spot.</p>

  <p>At first she thought he was going to pass her, but he stopped, and,
  sitting down in the chair recently occupied by Ralph, he looked across to
  where the long-plumed fan of Jessie Dame was working agitatedly.</p>

  <p>"The skeleton at the feast," he said sardonically.</p>

  <p>This piece of mordant humour was so typical of him that she laughed.</p>

  <p>"I don't often come to the Mispah," he said, "but if I had, and I'd seen
  that lady before, I should have been saved a very uncomfortable
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>She hoped that others might also have been saved the discomfort of that
  afternoon, but she took little notice of his remark, thinking that he was
  still jesting.</p>

  <p>"All gay and girlish," he said. "How funny! Somehow I never imagined that
  lank woman in a setting like this."</p>

  <p>"Why not, Major Amery?" she asked, ready to defend her friend, and
  conscious that she was being something of a hypocrite, since she had
  experienced exactly the same sense of the incongruous as he was now feeling.
  "Jessie works very hard, and she's as much entitled to a little recreation as
  I am&mdash;but probably it strikes you as being funny that I am here?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You have been dining with the massive Tupperwill," he said, "and the
  Hallams brought you on. Besides, you fit. The illuminations on that woman's
  ears are fascinating."</p>

  <p>Every time Jessie turned her head there was a flicker and flash of
  jewels.</p>

  <p>"And all on three pounds a week!" he murmured. "The thrift and economy of
  a poor working girl fills me with awe. That is Hallam and his wife, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>He looked down to where Ralph was threading a difficult way across the
  crowded floor.</p>

  <p>"That is Dr. Hallam and his sister-in-law," she said.</p>

  <p>"His wife," he corrected, and, seeing her look of blank astonishment: "You
  didn't know he was married? He hasn't told you?"</p>

  <p>Elsa shook her head. "No, I didn't know," she said simply.</p>

  <p>Her mind was in a turmoil, Why had Ralph kept the truth from her? What had
  he hoped to gain by his deception? As if reading her thoughts, the man went
  on:</p>

  <p>"I think it is a matter of convenience, and, for Hallam, of mental ease.
  His lady wife has one or two unpleasant hobbies&mdash;you haven't lost any
  small article of jewellery, have you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, wondering.</p>

  <p>"Did you seriously mean what you said the other day&mdash;that she was a
  kleptomaniac?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is the scientific description. Personally, I should call her a
  sneak-thief, with an itch for other people's property. You need not be
  shocked: some of our best people suffer from that complaint."</p>

  <p>But married! She couldn't understand that. And yet she remembered
  wondering how it was she had never met his "sister-in-law" before. The reason
  was plain enough now.</p>

  <p>For a second she felt uneasy, but then the humour of the situation came to
  her, and she laughed softly. "She was the skeleton at his feast, then?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>Amery's eyes twinkled for a second and grew solemn again. "Or he at hers:
  I'm not quite sure," he said. "That man with Miss Dame is her father&mdash;I
  suppose you know that? I didn't, until I took the trouble to enquire. You
  haven't seen him closely, I suppose? You should, but probably you're not
  interested in anthropology? Pale blue eyes and a very large, fat, straight
  chin, which usually marks a man with epileptic tendencies. The hair of the
  moustache extremely coarse&mdash;Mantegazza thinks that is a bad sign."</p>

  <p>"Mantegazza?" she asked, bewildered.</p>

  <p>"He is an Italian anthropologist&mdash;one of the few whose conclusions
  are worth study. The thickness of the moustache hair should be .01 of a
  millimetre. If it is coarser than that, the man is either a great criminal or
  a great scientist."</p>

  <p>She listened, astounded, as he rattled on, and remembering the
  uncomfortable moment she had had when he had told her her height and detected
  the accident she had once had to her little finger, she began to understand
  that he had been pursuing a hobby.</p>

  <p>"You have made a study of these things, Major Amery?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, years ago, when I was in the Indian Service, before I adopted the
  criminal career which is now exercising the minds of Scotland Yard,
  anthropology was an interest of mine."</p>

  <p>She was looking at him intently. Not a muscle of his face twitched; there
  was no sign of embarrassment or of shame, when he expressed his guilt. And
  there was no boastfulness, either. He was simply stating a fact, and a fact
  beyond controversy. The music stopped, there was a clapping of hands, and he
  waited, his eyes fixed upon Ralph and his wife. Not until the music started
  again, and he saw the pair resume the interrupted dance, did he speak.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the Dames?"</p>

  <p>"I know Jessie," she said. "I've never met her father."</p>

  <p>"Ever been to the house, I mean?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"She's invited me to tea, but I've never gone."</p>

  <p>"You should go," he nodded. "And I think I should go very soon if I were
  you. It is rather a nice house, near Notting Hill Gate; a largish kind of
  establishment for people of those circumstances, with a fairly big garden, at
  the end of which is the garage."</p>

  <p>"Have they a car?" she asked, open-eyed.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. As a matter of fact, I have not been immensely interested,
  except that I've seen the house&mdash;in fact, I've seen the house of every
  person holding down a job at Amery &amp; Amery's. The position of a girl who
  lives with her parents&mdash;or parent, for I understand Miss Dame has no
  mother&mdash;is always the more difficult to judge. Her father may be
  anything or nothing. By the way, you have a black box at home, haven't you,
  belonging to Tarn&mdash;a box with trays?"</p>

  <p>He turned so abruptly to this subject that she was surprised into an
  admission. And then: "How on earth did you know?" she demanded. "And what is
  the mystery of that box? You're the second person who has spoken&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Only two?" he asked quickly. "Are you sure only two people have asked you
  about that box? Myself and who?"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Hallam. You think there is something in that box?" She looked at him
  gravely, and he nodded. "Drugs?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the drug that dopes the world," he said flippantly. "I shouldn't
  investigate too closely if I were you, but under no circumstances are you to
  let that box out of your possession. Here comes your amiable friend, and by
  the expression on his face I gather that he has recognized me."</p>

  <p>"Won't you wait and meet him?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated, "Yes, I think I will," he said.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, Ralph came along the narrow balcony, a watchful,
  suspicious man.</p>

  <p>"You know Major Amery?" said Elsa.</p>

  <p>He bowed slightly.</p>

  <p>"And of course Mrs. Hallam you know?" said Ralph.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have met your wife."</p>

  <p>Their eyes met in a challenge, and Ralph's were the first to be
  lowered.</p>

  <p>So Elsa knew! Well, she had to know sooner or later, and he would rather
  she learnt in the present circumstances than any other.</p>

  <p>"I have identified the lady of the earrings," he said as he sat down.
  "She's one of your girls."</p>

  <p>"You mean Miss Dame? Yes, she is one of our minor lights."</p>

  <p>"You must pay very big money, Major Amery," said Ralph drily.</p>

  <p>"Evidently," was the cold reply.</p>

  <p>He got up with a little bow to the girl, and, without so much as noticing
  Lou Hallam, walked back to his place between the pillars.</p>

  <p>"What did he have to say?" asked Ralph. And then: "So he told you my
  guilty secret?"</p>

  <p>He tried to carry the matter off with a smile, but he went red under her
  questioning scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"The fact is," he said awkwardly, "Lou and I have never quite hit it off,
  which was probably my fault. But we've always been good friends&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Up to a point," broke in Mrs. Hallam. "He told you we were married, did
  he? That fellow ought to be running the gossip column of the
  'Megaphone'!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap36"
     id="chap36">XXXVI. A HOUSE IN DISORDER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AMERY sat over his third cup of coffee and a cigarette,
  watching the dancers, long after Elsa had passed, with a little nod and a
  smile, on her way home. He saw Miss Dame disappear finally, and the first
  series of lights go out as a warning that the club was closing, and then he
  came down the marble stairs into Citron Street. It was raining, and the
  linkman, holding a huge umbrella, lifted his hand enquiringly.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," said Amery. "I'll walk."</p>

  <p>He strolled across Leicester Square, through the midnight bustle of
  Piccadilly Circus, and made his leisurely way up Regent Street. He had not
  gone far before he was conscious that his movements were under observation.
  Glancing back, he saw two men, as leisurely as himself, walking in his rear,
  and smiled quietly.</p>

  <p>As he turned into Hanover Square, one of his pursuers quickened his step
  and passed him, and Amery swerved slightly to give him a wider berth. Hanover
  Square was a bleak desert; a crawling taxicab was the only sign of life.</p>

  <p>He whistled, and the cab came toward him. The door was open and he was
  stepping in, when a man came round the back of the taxi. It was impossible to
  see his face; his felt hat was pulled down over his eyes, a silk scarf
  covered his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Stillman!" said Amery pleasantly.</p>

  <p>As he spoke he gave the impression that he was waiting to meet the
  advancing man. The words were hardly spoken before, with a quick turn, he had
  leapt into the cab, slammed the door behind him, and the muffled man faced
  the black cavity of a pistol muzzle.</p>

  <p>"Stillman, I think?" said Amery.</p>

  <p>The action had been so quick that the man was taken off his guard.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," he said, in a muffled voice.
  "I'm only telling you to get out and stay out!"</p>

  <p>"That sounds familiar," said Amery coolly. "I seem to have used the
  identical term when addressing a partner, confederate or enemy of yours, one
  Maurice Tarn. You talk too much!"</p>

  <p>The motionless figure on the pavement moved his hand slightly, but, dark
  as the night, Amery detected the motion.</p>

  <p>"Keep your hand down, my friend, or in a minute or two this cab will be
  carrying your lifeless remains to Middlesex Hospital, and the most brilliant
  house surgeon will not be able to restore animation. I should hate to put our
  friend the cabman to the inconvenience of mussing his upholstery."</p>

  <p>"Listen," said the man, hoarse with rage. "Life is pretty sweet to you, I
  guess? If it is, you'll get out of the game. I don't know who Stillman is,
  but you can't bluff me&mdash;I know who you are! There's a heap of
  correspondence in the bottom drawer of your desk that is very interesting to
  read&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>Bang!</i></p>

  <p>Amery had been leaning forward to the window, and he caught the glitter of
  a gun and flung himself back just in time. He felt the wind of the bullet as
  it passed the bridge of his nose, and before he could recover, the frightened
  driver had jerked the taxicab forward and was going at full speed round the
  gardens of the square. Looking back, Amery caught a glimpse of a figure
  running across the road... On the whole he approved the driver's
  precipitation.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to the nearest police station," quavered the taxi-man, when
  Amery leant out of the window to give him instructions. "I don't care what
  you say, I'm taking you to the nearest police station! I'm not going to have
  that sort of thing happen in my cab!"</p>

  <p>And then a hand came round the corner, and in it was a crisp, bright note.
  By the light of the lamp which illuminated the meter, the driver saw the
  magic word "Ten" and changed his mind.</p>

  <p>"All right; where do you want to go?" he growled.</p>

  <p>The sinister man gave directions and leant back in the cab. That was a
  narrow squeak. He must never take such a risk again.</p>

  <p>Usually a light burnt in the passage of his house, visible through the
  transom, but there was a complete darkness when he put the key in the lock
  and pushed the door wide open. No sound came to his ears save the ticking of
  the clock on the stair landing. Feeling along the wall, he found the switch
  and illuminated the passage.</p>

  <p>The first thing that struck him as curious was that the door leading to
  his study was open, and he had taken a step toward the room, when he heard
  the patter of feet behind him and turned quickly, to meet the grinning face
  of Feng Ho. The Chinaman was clad from head to foot in a shining oilskin.</p>

  <p>"Inclemency of elements&mdash;" he began, and then he saw Amery's face,
  and asked quickly, in the Cantonese dialect:</p>

  <p>"What is wrong?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied Amery in the same tongue, "but I rather think
  somebody has been here in my absence."</p>

  <p>The Chinanian ran past him into the open study and put on the lights.
  Amery heard a guttural exclamation of astonishment, and, following the man
  into the room, saw the cause.</p>

  <p>The place was in hopeless confusion. Half the drawers of his desk lay on
  the floor; the cupboards had been wrenched open, the furniture moved, and a
  little pinewood cupboard had been emptied by the simple process of tipping
  its contents on to the carpet.</p>

  <p>"Where is Chang? Go and find him," said Amery quickly.</p>

  <p>The Chinaman ran out of the room, and presently Amery heard his name
  called and went towards the voice. Feng Ho was kneeling on the floor by the
  side of a prostrate figure, so trussed and bound and gagged that he bore no
  resemblance to anything human. He was unconscious when the bonds were
  loosened and the steel handcuffs unlocked.</p>

  <p>"There's been no struggle here," said Amery, looking round the little
  pantry where the man had been found.</p>

  <p>Feng Ho went to the mysterious region at the back of the house and came
  back with a basin of water.</p>

  <p>"They came through the kitchen," he said. "The window is open."</p>

  <p>Amery's European servants did not sleep on the premises; the last of these
  usually left at half-past ten, and it must have been after that hour that the
  burglar made his entrance.</p>

  <p>"They have taken my dossier," said Amery, after a careful examination of
  the strewn papers on the floor.</p>

  <p>He pointed to a steel drawer; the lock had been torn bodily; from its
  place, and where the drawer had been was a confusion of splintered wood.</p>

  <p>It was curious that neither of the men suggested summoning the police.
  That idea did not seem to occur to them, and when Feng Ho went back to attend
  the half-conscious Chinaman, and Amery took up the telephone, it was not a
  police number that he called.</p>

  <p>"It must have been done half an hour ago," said the sinister man
  thoughtfully, after his telephone conversation had finished and Feng Ho had
  returned. "Quick work!"</p>

  <p>Again he took up the telephone; this time he gave a Mayfair number, and
  almost immediately Ralph Hallam's voice answered him.</p>

  <p>"Is that Dr. Hallam?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply. There was no mistaking the voice.</p>

  <p>"So you're at home, are you?" said Amery with a smile, and before the
  answer came he had hung up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Quick work," he muttered. "Help me get this stuff together. Where have
  you left Chang?"</p>

  <p>"I've put him on his bed. He is a little shaken, and not hurt," said Feng
  Ho, with that curious callousness which so shocks the Westerner. "Perhaps he
  will live."</p>

  <p>"I think so."</p>

  <p>Chang not only lived, but within an hour was a very voluble young man,
  invoking his familiar devils to the destruction of his enemies.</p>

  <p>"I was asleep, <i>tao</i>," he said frankly, "and I knew nothing until my
  head was in a bag and my hands tied."</p>

  <p>"If you had been awake then, I think you would have been asleep now,
  Chang," said Amery cryptically.</p>

  <p>He spent the rest of the night putting his papers in order, but the most
  important collection of documents had disappeared.</p>

  <p>He knew this before the search began. He had known it from the moment
  Stillman had spoken. To-morrow he must be early at the office. There were
  other things even as important as his dossier, and these must not be
  found.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap37"
     id="chap37">XXXVII. THE FOUR BROWN PACKETS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ELSA MARLOWE woke up in the middle of the night with a sense
  of deep trouble. She got up and put on the light, and, sitting down on the
  bed, carefully analyzed her mind to find the cause. Was it the discovery that
  Ralph Hallam was married? She dismissed that thought as being too absurd for
  consideration. Jessie Dame? It had certainly disturbed her to find Jessie at
  the Mispah Club, bejewelled and expensively frocked; but Amery had spoken the
  truth when he said that working girls were very difficult to place. They
  might come from homes where families were starving, and none would guess the
  tragedy behind their smart frocks and their amiability; or they might be the
  children of well-off people, immeasurably the social superiors of their
  employers. She had often heard Jessie Dame talk about her "pater," and had
  dismissed that little piece of pompous Latinity as sheer snobbishness.
  Possibly Jessie's excess of refinement was based on a consciousness of
  superiority.</p>

  <p>No, it was not Jessie. She was very well able to look after herself,
  romantic as she was, though Elsa determined that the long-deferred visit to
  the girl's ancestral home should be made that day, for she was curious to see
  what kind of home life the girl had.</p>

  <p>Certainly it wasn't Jessie. And it was not Ralph. Then what had so
  depressed her? In a vague kind of way she felt it was Amery, his queerness,
  his loneliness, and the sinister shadow that her suspicions had thrown over
  him. He was engaged, she knew, in a business that was both dangerous and
  unsavoury. He had undoubtedly struck down a comfortable middle-aged banker,
  for no other offence than that he had talked too much. Cold-blooded, cynical,
  remorseless, ruthless... and very lonely.</p>

  <p>She caught her breath in horror at herself. She had once heard of a man
  whose formula for winning the love of women was to "treat 'em rough and keep
  'em going!" Was she being subjected to this process, and was this the
  result?</p>

  <p>She was wide awake now. Her sense of unhappiness had been swallowed up in
  the alarm of her discovery. Looking at the clock, she saw that it was four.
  And then her eyes fell upon the battered box which had so exercised the
  interest of Ralph and the sinister man. She pulled open the lid, took out the
  three top trays, and tried again to move the fourth, but it was screwed
  tightly, if, clumsily, and defied her efforts. Lifting one end of the box,
  she felt its weight. There was something beneath that fastened
  tray&mdash;what?</p>

  <p>It was five o'clock when she went back to bed, but not to sleep. She was
  dressed and had cooked her breakfast before Mrs. Hallam's daily maid had put
  in her appearance. Even now she did not feel the least bit sleepy. A night of
  rain and storm had been succeeded by a bright spring morning, which stirred
  something in her heart that was akin to happiness.</p>

  <p>"You're early, miss," said the maid, with that touch of resentment which
  domestics invariably show toward the early riser.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to the office early," said Elsa, feeling that some excuse was
  necessary, and not wishing to have the story of her sleeplessness carried to
  Mrs. Hallam.</p>

  <p>It was like Elsa that having, on the spur of the moment, invented an
  intention of going early, she should find herself, soon after eight, walking
  up Wood Street and wondering whether the office would be open.</p>

  <p>It was not only open, but apparently there were other early callers. She
  saw two men talking in the doorway, and recognised one as Bickerson. There
  was no mistaking his well-set figure. His head was turned as she came into
  view, and he was walking slowly up the street, in earnest consultation with
  his companion. Before he had turned, she was in the passage and mounting the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>The cleaners had left her room, and she was apparently the only member of
  the staff on the premises. Fortunately, there was plenty of work to occupy
  her, and she went into Amery's cold office to collect a card index of
  addresses that she had promised herself to put in order.</p>

  <p>Placing the little box on his desk, her nimble fingers passed quickly over
  their edges, withdrawing one here, replacing another there, for, neat in
  other respects, he was the most careless of men, and more often than not it
  was necessary to search the floor for addresses he had removed and forgotten
  to return.</p>

  <p>The door was ajar; she could hear distinctly the sound of feet on the
  stairs, and wondered what other member of the staff came so early. And then
  she heard Bickerson's voice, as two men came into her office. She raised her
  head and listened.</p>

  <p>"He will be here at nine. I would rather the search was conducted in his
  presence," said the voice of the stranger, and by the respectful tone in
  which Bickerson's answered, it was evident that he was the detective's
  superior in rank.</p>

  <p>"Just as you like, sir. I've not put the warrant into effect before, but
  the information which came to me early this morning leaves no doubt that the
  stuff is on the premises. There's a cupboard by the side of the fireplace
  which I noticed when I called last time."</p>

  <p>Elsa listened, breathless. Looking round, she saw the long, narrow
  cupboard, and remembered that it was one she had not seen the Major use. What
  was the "stuff"? Should she go out, meet and warn him? That might help, but
  it could hardly prevent the discovery of the incriminating material, whatever
  it was, that was behind the small door.</p>

  <p>Somebody took a step toward the room.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you where," said Bickerson.</p>

  <p>She looked round, and in a second had passed through the door way into the
  little cupboard-like apartment which served Amery as a wash-place and
  dressing-room. She was just in time.</p>

  <p>"There it is," she heard Bickerson say, "on the right of the fireplace.
  Most of these old-fashioned offices have cupboards in that position. I don't
  see why we shouldn't open it now, sir."</p>

  <p>"Wait till he comes," said the other gruffly, and then the sound of their
  voices receded.</p>

  <p>She came back to Amery's room. They had closed the door behind them when
  they went out: the key was in the lock, and, without counting the
  consequences, she turned it and flew back to the cupboard by the mantel-
  piece. This was locked, and defied her efforts to open. In desperation, she
  took up the poker from the fireplace, and, with a strength which surprised
  her, smashed in the panel. The sound must have reached the ears of the men
  outside, for they came back, and one of them tried the door.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" he called.</p>

  <p>She made no answer. Again the poker fell upon the door, and now the panel
  was so broken that she could see inside.</p>

  <p>On a shelf lay four little packets, each about three inches square, and
  each wrapped in brown paper and fastened with sealed string. She put in her
  trembling hand and took out the first. The label was partly in German and
  partly in English, but she needed no knowledge of German to realize that the
  package contained cocaine.</p>

  <p>What should she do? The firegrate was empty. Then she remembered the
  washing-bowl.</p>

  <p>Somebody was hammering on the door.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?"</p>

  <p>With her teeth set, she ignored all except the pressing problem of Amery's
  danger. Tearing off the paper cover, she let drop into the basin a heap of
  glittering white powder. Turning on both taps, she emptied the second and
  then the others, and, without waiting to watch the deadly drug flow to waste,
  she came back to Amery's room, found his matches, and, striking a light,
  burnt the wrappers, watching them turn to black ash. When she retuned to the
  wash-bowl, every vestige of the cocaine had disappeared, and then, and not
  until then, did she walk calmly to the door, turn the key and open it. A
  red-faced, angry Bickerson confronted her, behind him an older man, taller
  and white-haired.</p>

  <p>"What have you been doing?" demanded Bickerson roughly. "Why didn't you
  open the door when I called you?"</p>

  <p>"Because I do not recognize your right to give me instructions," she
  said.</p>

  <p>One glance he gave at the smashed cupboard door.</p>

  <p>"I see! So you're working with Amery, are you, young lady? It's as well to
  know that. I suppose you know you're liable to a severe penalty?"</p>

  <p>"For what crime?" she asked, with a calm she did not feel. "Looking after
  my employer's interests?"</p>

  <p>"What did you find in there?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>He saw the charred paper in the fireplace.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, eh?" he said between his teeth.</p>

  <p>He heard the sound of running water, looked into the dressing-room and
  understood.</p>

  <p>"What did you find?" he asked again. "Come, Miss Marlowe, I'm sure you do
  not wish to connive in the breaking of the law. What was in that
  cupboard?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Elsa doggedly.</p>

  <p>She was very white; her knees felt as if at any moment they would give way
  under her; but she stood up square to the police officer, defiance in the
  tilt of her chin and in her fine eyes.</p>

  <p>"You didn't know she was in that room when you spoke," said the older man
  with a little chuckle. "Young lady, you've taught a very able detective
  inspector a lesson which I hope he will not forget!"</p>

  <p>Bickerson was now conducting a thorough search of the office. The cupboard
  on the left of the fireplace was unlocked but empty. He tried the drawers of
  Amery's desk: they all opened save one, and as he pulled a bunch of keys from
  his pocket and knelt to open this, the man most concerned in the search
  walked into the room.</p>

  <p>"Looking for something?" he asked politely.</p>

  <p>"I have a warrant to search your office," said Bickerson, trembling with
  anger.</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," replied Amery coolly. "Since when have Scotland Yard had the
  right of searching a City office? I am under the impression that there is an
  admirable force of police operating in the one square mile of territory known
  as the City of London; and unless I am mistaken, these gentlemen are
  extremely jealous of their authority being taken from their hands. May I see
  your warrant?"</p>

  <p>He took the paper from the man's hand and read it. "This is an
  authorization to search my house in Brook Street, not this office," he said,
  "and I'm rather surprised that Superintendent Wille connived at this
  irregularity."</p>

  <p>The bigger man started.</p>

  <p>"I understood that the necessary permission from the City Commissioner had
  been obtained," he said stiffly. "You told me this, Bickerson."</p>

  <p>"The City detective is downstairs," growled the other. "If Major Amery is
  so particular as to form, we'd better have him up."</p>

  <p>When the third detective arrived, Elsa recognised him as the man she had
  seen in consultation with Bickerson. He produced the document, and seemed a
  little piqued to find that the search had already begun. For whilst there is
  perfect friendship between the police of the guarded City and Scotland Yard,
  there is, as Major Amery very truly said, a very jealous objection to the
  Yard men operating east of Temple Bar or west of Aldgate Pump.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to be found here," said Bickerson, after Amery had opened
  the locked drawer and the City man had made his search. "But it was here!" He
  pointed to the smashed cupboard. This had been the first object on which
  Amery's eyes had fallen when he entered the room. "There was something there,
  and this girl has taken it out and destroyed it. I think you will be sorry
  for this, Miss Marlowe."</p>

  <p>"If she is," said Amery coldly, "I will 'phone you."</p>

  <p>He did not speak again until the men had left the building, then he turned
  and surveyed the girl with a new interest. And from her, his eyes strayed to
  the wrecked cupboard.</p>

  <p>"You did that, of course?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"What did you find?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Major Amery, why do you pretend?" she burst forth. "You know what I
  found! Four packets of that awful stuff!"</p>

  <p>"Opium?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what it was; I think it was cocaine. It was white and
  glistening."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"That was cocaine. Four packets?" He whistled softly. "And you washed them
  away, did you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said shortly, and was preparing to go back to her work.</p>

  <p>"That was very good of you." His politeness was almost mechanical. "Very
  good of you indeed! Four packets of cocaine. German, by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course they were German!" she said impatiently. "You
  know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said. "I have never had a greater surprise than to
  learn that there were drugs in this office."</p>

  <p>He walked to his desk, gave a little jerk to the edge, and, to her
  astonishment, the whole of the top slid back, revealing a shallow cavity in
  which lay a small thin package of papers. These he took out, put in his
  inside pocket, pulled the top of the desk back in its place, and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Did Mr. Bickerson, in the course of any unguarded conversation, reveal
  how he came to know that the cocaine was in my office?"</p>

  <p>"No; he said he knew early this morning."</p>

  <p>"I see," said the other softly. "Now I wonder how our friend put them
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Our friend&mdash;which friend?"</p>

  <p>"A gentleman named Stillman." he said carelessly, "who came in before
  office hours and planted the drugs in my office."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" she stammered, "aren't you a dealer in drugs?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I have never bought anything more deadly than chewing-gum in my life," he
  said.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap38"

  <p class="first">ELSA could only gaze at him blankly.</p>

  <p>"But you are Soyoka! I know... you have admitted that you are!"</p>

  <p>His face was expressionless.</p>

  <p>"Be that as it may," he said, "I have never bought or sold drugs of any
  kind, with the exception perhaps of the interesting commodity of which I
  spoke."</p>

  <p>She drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it."</p>

  <p>"Don't try," he said.</p>

  <p>He walked across to the smashed cupboard.</p>

  <p>"Poker?" he asked. "Of course it was the poker. Now just tell me how you
  came to do it."</p>

  <p>In a few words she explained how she had come early, had seen the
  detectives waiting in the street, and overheard Bickerson and his
  superintendent talking, and all that followed.</p>

  <p>"How very wonderful!" he said, looking at her strangely. "You remarkable
  girl!"</p>

  <p>She coloured under his eyes, felt absurdly tearful, for the reaction had
  come, and she wanted to get away, sit down and recover her normal breath. He
  must have seen this, for his old manner returned.</p>

  <p>"Ask Feng Ho to come to me, will you, please?"</p>

  <p>She went out and found Feng Ho tickling the canary with the end of a
  long-handled paint-brush, and the Chinaman was inclined to linger, until she
  said: "Feng Ho, something has happened in Major Amery's office. He wants you
  at once."</p>

  <p>And then Feng Ho moved with some celerity.</p>

  <p>It was only a quarter to nine, she saw, when she looked at the office
  clock, and she was glad for this little respite before the real business of
  the day commenced. She was feeling weak and shaken, and she would have given
  anything to have got away from the office for an hour.</p>

  <p>An interest in life came with the arrival of Miss Dame, and, observing the
  fiery hair and the red button of a nose, Elsa wondered if this plainly
  dressed and unattractive female could have been the resplendent being she had
  seen on the previous night. The fatigue attendant upon the gay life left no
  visible evidence, for Miss Dame was as voluble as ever.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she said, "who do you think I met downstairs? That Mr.
  Dickerson, the famous sleuth!"</p>

  <p>"Bickerson?"</p>

  <p>"Bicker or Dicker, it's all the same to me. Such a nice man! The way he
  lifted his hat shows that he was meant for something better than a detective.
  And yet I've known a few good detectives in my time, perfect gentlemen but
  secret service agents, if you understand? When the plans are stolen&mdash;you
  know what I mean, Government plans about war, where the forts are going to be
  built and that sort of thing&mdash;they get them back. They're younger than
  Mr. Bickerson, though," she added, as though regretting the lost
  opportunities for romance which the stolid Bickerson might otherwise have
  offered.</p>

  <p>"Jessie, how long have you been a member of the Mispah Club?"</p>

  <p>Miss Dame dropped the papers she was carrying, and hid her confusion in
  gathering them together.</p>

  <p>"My dear, how you startled me! How did you know I was a member of the
  Mispah?" she asked, a little self-consciously. "Of course, there's no reason
  why I shouldn't be. A young girl like me wants to see a little bit of life.
  But I'm not, as a matter of fact. Pater is a member. Why&mdash;did you see
  me?"</p>

  <p>Elsa nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw you," she said quietly, and Miss Dame tossed her head.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's nothing in it, is there?" she asked defiantly. "I mean, a
  young girl has to live. She can't be a fogey or a stick in-the-mud. It's
  quite time enough to settle down when you're older. And if the pater takes me
  out, well, that's nobody's business. Not that I'm saying you're poking your
  nose into my affairs, because I'm not. Did you like the dress?"
  inconsequently. "Of course, the jewels... I borrowed those; they're not real.
  Yes, they are&mdash;they are real, but I..."</p>

  <p>She was incoherent, torn between a pride of possession and a fear of the
  impression she might be creating.</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to think I'm not a good girl, Miss Marlowe," she said,
  with an almost comical attempt at the virtuous. "But my pater is rather well
  off. I've never told anybody, because they might think it funny that I'm
  working here for a mere pittance, so to speak. I needn't work at all."</p>

  <p>"I wonder you do, Jessie."</p>

  <p>Miss Dame was apparently also wondering at her condescension, for she did
  not answer, and though she opened her lips twice to speak, it was not until
  the third effort that she offered an explanation which was, on the whole,
  unconvincing.</p>

  <p>"Pater likes me to have something to occupy my time. 'Satan finds work for
  idle hands,' as the good book says. Pater's rich."</p>

  <p>"That's what Major Amery thought," said Elsa, and Miss Dame's jaw
  dropped.</p>

  <p>"Amery?" she squeaked, her face going pale. "My Gawd! he didn't see me?
  Was he there?"</p>

  <p>Elsa nodded.</p>

  <p>"At the Mispah&mdash;that misery at the Mispah! What did he say, Miss
  Marlowe? I suppose he thought it was funny?"</p>

  <p>"He did rather," said Elsa, speaking nothing but the truth.</p>

  <p>But it was not the girl's idea of funniness that she was thinking
  about.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet he did!" said Jessie in a hushed voice, her eyes gleaming redly
  through her spectacles. "I suppose he's got all sorts of low ideas about me.
  Did he see pater?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he saw your father."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Miss Dame blankly. And then, after a long cogitation: "It can't
  be helped. He didn't ask to see me this morning?"</p>

  <p>"No, he doesn't seem to be the slightest bit interested in you this
  morning," said Elsa with a smile, "but that doesn't mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know it doesn't mean anything," interrupted Miss Dame. "He's one of
  those fly, underhand people, who are always on the look-out for trouble, and
  before you know where you are, bingo!"</p>

  <p>She thought again, and again said that it couldn't be helped.</p>

  <p>"I bought it in Shaftesbury Avenue&mdash;the dress, I mean&mdash;fourteen
  guineas. It was a lot of money, but you can't get classy robes cheaper than
  that. Pater collects diamonds; he's in the&mdash;in the trade&mdash;in the
  diamond trade, I mean. As a hobby."</p>

  <p>She seemed anxious to discover the effect she had produced upon the girl,
  but more especially upon Major Amery.</p>

  <p>"If he saw me with my pater, he would know it was all right, wouldn't he?
  I mean, he'd know I wasn't one of these fast girls that go round luring men
  to their ruin?"</p>

  <p>Elsa did not laugh, though she was strongly tempted.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I should worry what Major Amery thinks," she said
  soothingly; "and unless he mentions the matter to you, I should not speak
  about it."</p>

  <p>"Hm!" said Miss Dame dubiously.</p>

  <p>She made no further appearance that morning, and Elsa was not sorry, for
  Amery was in a mood of indecision. Usually, his letters to his foreign
  correspondents needed little or no revision. As they were dictated, so were
  they signed; except on very rare occasions, when he would scrap a letter and
  begin anew. This morning he dictated a long epistle, and she was half-way
  through its transcription when he came into her room.</p>

  <p>"You needn't bother about that letter," he said. "Bring your book and I
  will give you another one."</p>

  <p>And then the same thing happened again. She was almost on the last
  sentence of the second literary effort when he appeared.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite like the wording of that letter. Will you come in, and
  we'll try afresh?" he said.</p>

  <p>It was a letter to a Chinese merchant in Shanghai, and dealt, not with
  shipments of merchandise, but with a mysterious individual to whom he
  referred as F.O.I. F.O.I. wasn't quite satisfied with the way things were
  going. And F.O.I. thought that a little more energy might be displayed at the
  Chinese end. At the same time, F.O.I. recognized all the difficulties and was
  deeply appreciative of all Mr. T'Chang Fui Zen was doing. F.O.I. was also
  worried about a man called Stillman, "though," said the letter, "I have been
  able to locate this gentleman, and hope at an early date to counteract his
  operations to our advantage." This passage occurred in all three letters, and
  seemed to be the main theme, though there were endless details which varied
  in description with each new attempt he made to produce the perfect
  communication.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you get rather bored with typing the same letter over and over
  again?" he said, as he put his signature to the last of the epistles.</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"No; it doesn't often happen, and I'm getting quite used to your ways now,
  Major Amery. Soon, I think, I shall understand you!"</p>

  <p>"And you're leaving on Saturday, too," he mused. Then, catching her eye,
  he laughed as though he were enjoying some secret jest of his.</p>

  <p>He followed her into her room and took a quick glance round. "Why, of
  course!" he said. "Though that doesn't explain everything."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him.</p>

  <p>"Explain everything?" she repeated.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of&mdash;another matter," he said hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Just before lunch, in his abrupt way, he asked her a question, which, like
  so many of his interjections, was altogether unexpected.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going to-night?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"To-night? Nowhere."</p>

  <p>She could never lose the habit of surprise at the strange butterfly
  movements of the sinister man's mind.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course I'm sure, Major. I am more especially sure because Faust
  is being broadcast from the Opera House&mdash;and I love the music."</p>

  <p>For the first time she saw the man startled.</p>

  <p>"Faust? How strange, how very odd!"</p>

  <p>"I see nothing very odd in it," she laughed. "I am one of those wireless
  enthusiasts who love opera&mdash;I wouldn't miss a note or a word for
  anything!"</p>

  <p>"How very odd!" he said again. "Faust!"</p>

  <p>The oddness did not seem particularly obvious to Elsa, but she knew her
  man too well to pursue the subject; and, as she might have expected, when he
  spoke again it was of something that had not the slightest relation to opera
  or broadcasting.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget what I told you about your box," he said, and before she
  could answer he had gone back to his room, closed the door behind him, and
  she heard the click of the lock as the key turned.</p>

  <p>Elsa frowned. Was he quite...? Men who have lived for many years in hot
  climates, particularly the climate of India, were strange. She had known an
  old Indian general who invariably started dinner with a sweet and finished
  with soup. She couldn't imagine the sinister man doing anything so eccentric,
  she thought whimsically. But he was... queer.</p>

  <p>The luncheon interval gave her an opportunity of going back to Mrs.
  Hallam's flat for a prosaic purpose&mdash;to replace a laddered stocking.
  Mrs. Hallam had given her a key, and she went in, believing she would have
  the flat to herself, for the lady had told her she was going out to lunch.
  She walked down the narrow corridor, turned the handle of her door and walked
  in, and then stopped dead, with a gasp of amazement and annoyance.</p>

  <p>The black trunk was in the middle of the floor, and opened. By its side
  Ralph Hallam knelt in his shirt-sleeves, a screwdriver in his hand, and he
  was busily unscrewing the fourth tray.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap39"
     id="chap39">XXXIX. RALPH EXPLAINS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HE looked up with a start, and went very red.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, old girl!" he said, with an uneasy attempt at carelessness. "I
  thought I'd come and solve the mystery of your box."</p>

  <p>"I didn't think there was any mystery about it, Ralph," she said coldly;
  "and at any rate, I don't know why you want the thrill all to yourself."</p>

  <p>He got up, dusting the knees of his trousers, and put on his coat. "The
  truth is, Elsa, I wanted to save you from what might have been a very
  embarrassing discovery," he said. "I will say nothing against Maurice Tarn,
  but I rather think there is something hidden here which would shock you to
  see."</p>

  <p>Elsa's quiet smile he did not like.</p>

  <p>"I'm proof against shock, Ralph," she said.</p>

  <p>He had lifted the first of the loose trays to replace it, when she stopped
  him.</p>

  <p>"Continue the good work. Don't deny me my flash of excitement&mdash;one
  screw is out and there are only three others."</p>

  <p>"You mean you want it opened?" he said uncomfortably. "I should wait if I
  were you, Elsa. Give me a few minutes alone, and let me be sure there is
  nothing here you shouldn't see."</p>

  <p>Elsa tried to take the screwdriver from his hand, but he pulled it
  back.</p>

  <p>"Leave it," he said. "I'm dreadfully sorry if I've annoyed you, but
  believe me, I've nothing but your interests at heart."</p>

  <p>"Then why not finish your work and let me see what there is to be seen?
  And please don't distress yourself about shocking me, Ralph, because, if I
  really am not shockproof, at least I'm on the way to be. Won't you take out
  the other screws?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;as a matter of fact, just before you came in I had decided that
  it was hardly worth while."</p>

  <p>She watched him as he replaced the trays, pulled down the lid and pushed
  the box against the wall, where it had been when she had left that morning,
  and she noticed that he never let go of the screwdriver.</p>

  <p>"You're back early," he said. "They tell me you went out early this
  morning. I suppose Amery has some little humanity left in his system and has
  let you off for the day? I saw old Tupperwill this morning; he asked after
  you. Queer devil, Tupperwill! You've made a hit there, Elsa, and I shouldn't
  be surprised if our stout friend doesn't invent another excuse for a
  party...."</p>

  <p>He chattered on, clearly ill at ease, anxious to go, and yet as anxious to
  be sure that she should not finish the work he had begun. She decided the
  matter for him.</p>

  <p>"I want my room now," she said, and almost pushed him out.</p>

  <p>When she had made her change and come out into the dining-room, he was on
  the point of leaving.</p>

  <p>"Can I take you anywhere? Have you had lunch?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've had lunch," she said, which was not true.</p>

  <p>Her objection to his presence was so marked that presently he began
  pulling on his gloves.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't imagine I had any designs on your property," he said
  jokingly. "And believe me, Elsa, I am serious when I ask you not to open that
  box except in my presence."</p>

  <p>"Well, open it now," she said.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, this is not the moment. You will understand why
  when"&mdash;lamely&mdash;"well, before you are much older."</p>

  <p>When he had gone, she went into the little kitchenette in search of a
  screwdriver, determined that she would see for herself what he was keeping
  from her, but apparently tools were not included in Mrs. Hallam's household
  equipment, and, locking the door of her room and putting the key in her
  pocket, she went out, to find Ralph, a worried figure, biting his nails on
  the sidewalk before the mansions. He seemed relieved that she had come out so
  soon.</p>

  <p>"You have a key of the flat: may I have it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>For a second he seemed inclined to refuse, and then, with a smile,
  produced it from his waistcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>"Really, Elsa, you're taking quite a high hand to deprive me of the key of
  my&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not your flat surely? I shouldn't like to feel that you had the means of
  entry day and night, Ralph," she said quietly, and for the second time that
  morning he coloured a deep red.</p>

  <p>Refusing his escort, she found a taxi and drove back to a City restaurant,
  where she had a small lunch, before returning to her work.</p>

  <p>The door of Amery's room was still locked, and when she knocked his voice
  asked sharply what she wanted. A few minutes after this the door was
  unlocked, and, going into the room, she found it empty.</p>

  <p>At three o'clock the telephone bell rang. She took all the calls in her
  office, and those that were intended for her employer she switched through,
  after she had first made enquiries as to whether he would accept the call.
  This time:</p>

  <p>"Can I speak with Miss Marlowe?" asked a familiar voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm speaking," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"It is Mr. Tupperwill. Is Major Amery in?"</p>

  <p>She recognized his voice before he told her his name.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Tupperwill, he is out."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible for me to see you, Miss Marlowe? It is on rather an
  important matter, and I am particularly anxious that Major Amery should not
  know that I have called you."</p>

  <p>"I can see you after office hours," she said. "Otherwise, I must get his
  permission to leave the office."</p>

  <p>A long silence.</p>

  <p>"Is that absolutely and vitally necessary?" asked the anxious voice of the
  banker. "I assure you I would not dream of asking you to come without your
  employer's knowledge unless the circumstances were very urgent; and they are
  very urgent, Miss Marlowe. I want to see you in the course of the next
  half&mdash;hour."</p>

  <p>Elsa considered the possibility.</p>

  <p>"I will come," she said, and cut short his thanks by hanging up the
  receiver.</p>

  <p>Amery allowed her more freedom than most secretaries have, and she could
  have gone out without reference to him; but somehow she was reluctant, on
  this occasion, to take advantage of the liberty he gave to her. She turned
  the matter over in her mind and then knocked at the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in."</p>

  <p>He had returned so quietly that she had not heard him.</p>

  <p>"I want to go out, Major Amery, for half an hour."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" he demanded bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Somebody wants to see me... Mr. Tupperwill."</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think he wished you to know that I was going to him: that is
  rather natural, isn't it? You don't mind?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "No, I don't mind a bit, but I'm glad you told me. If
  Tupperwill asks you whether I know where you have gone, you will tell
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course!" she said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I think I should."</p>

  <p>He was the strangest man, she thought, as the 'bus carried her toward Old
  Broad Street... the very strangest man. Such queer, unimportant details
  interested him. The big, vital things of life left him unmoved.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap40"
     id="chap40">XL. &mdash; THE NEW CHAUFFEUR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. TUPPERWILL'S office at the bank was situated on one of
  the innumerable courts that dive out of Old Broad Street and stagger through
  a labyrinth of passages to end no man knows where. One foot was on the step
  leading into the purlieus of the bank when Mr. Tupperwill appeared. She had
  the impression that he had been waiting, for he hurried down to meet her,
  and, taking her arm in a paternal fashion, led her deeper into the maze of
  crooked passages that intersected one another.</p>

  <p>"This is a short cut that will bring us to Lothbury," he said, leaving the
  girl without any explanation as to the business upon which he had called her
  so urgently to the centre of City.</p>

  <p>In Lothbury a car was waiting. She had a glimpse of a bearded chauffeur
  behind the window of his cabin.</p>

  <p>"I haven't much time&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"I won't keep you a moment longer than is necessary," said Mr. Tupperwill
  urgently.</p>

  <p>The driver evidently had his instructions, for in a few minutes they were
  running through Moorgate Street toward the City Road.</p>

  <p>"The matter I want to see you about is so important, so tremendously
  important, to me, that I simply dared not interview you at the bank. There
  is, I believe, a young lady at your place named Miss Dame?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have met her&mdash;once," said Mr. Tupperwill, evidently labouring
  under the strain of a deep emotion. "She was introduced to the bank&mdash;do
  you mind if I pull those curtains?"</p>

  <p>There were side curtains to the windows, and, without waiting for her
  permission, the stout man leant over and pulled them across so as to make it
  impossible that they should be seen from the street. He followed suit with
  the curtains on the other side, and then:</p>

  <p>"For your sake and my sake, I do not wish to be seen consulting you, Miss
  Marlowe."</p>

  <p>"Why on earth not?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"There is a reason, a very pressing reason, which you will understand
  sooner or later. You know Miss Dame?"</p>

  <p>"I know her very well."</p>

  <p>"Are you aware"&mdash;his voice sank&mdash;"that she is a lady of
  considerable wealth?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I am not," smiled Elsa. "I am under the impression that her father
  is well off, but that she is only just as rich as he can make her."</p>

  <p>"You think that?" Mr. Tupperwill bit his lower lip, and maintained silence
  until they were running through a drab street in Islington.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going, Mr. Tupperwill? I must be back at the office in half
  an hour."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I realize that. Believe me, I shall not keep you a moment longer than is
  necessary, and the Major will hardly miss you, even if he comes back."</p>

  <p>"He came back just as I went out," she said, "and of course I told him
  that I was coming to see you."</p>

  <p>She thought he had not heard this, for he did not answer her.</p>

  <p>"He came back just as you were going out?" he said at last, "And you told
  him, of course, that you were coming to see me? That I should expect you to
  do. It is a very small point, and one which perhaps would not appeal to the
  average employee, but I hold it as a maxim that not in the slightest degree
  should one deceive an employer."</p>

  <p>They were now in a street one side of which was occupied by a factory
  wall, and the other by a scattering of poor houses, except toward the farther
  end, where there was a yard of some kind, marked by high walls and a gate
  which was open.</p>

  <p>The car swung as though it were going into the gateway, and at that moment
  Mr. Tupperwill sprang to his feet, and, dropping the window with a crash,
  said something to the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>Instantly the man righted the machine and went slowly past the gates.
  Looking through, Elsa saw a little red quadrangle, surrounded on three sides
  by low buildings which had the appearance of stables.</p>

  <p>"Now why on earth did my man do that?" gasped Mr. Tupperwill in
  astonishment. "I don't like it, Miss Marlowe! I don't like it at all. He is a
  new man who came to me only last week, and&mdash;phew!" He mopped his large
  face. "I'm getting to the stage where I see a plot in the simplest action. I
  feel as if I am moving in an atmosphere of mystery and danger. In fact, Miss
  Marlowe, since that outrageous attack was made upon me, I have lost my
  nerve."</p>

  <p>They were now clear of the mean streets and were traversing the principal
  shopping thoroughfare of Islington, and, as the girl saw with relief, moving
  back toward the City.</p>

  <p>"You wanted to talk to me about Miss Dame," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, but that incident put everything out of my mind. Miss Dame...
  yes. A curious girl. And you think she isn't wealthy?" he asked anxiously.
  "And that if she pretended to be wealthy, she was deceiving me?"</p>

  <p>"Deceiving you! Surely she hasn't an account with Stebbing's?" The
  discreet Tupperwill evaded the question. He was apparently still preoccupied
  with his suspicions of the new chauffeur, for suddenly he burst forth
  fretfully:</p>

  <p>"I don't like it, I don't like it at all! And yet I had the most excellent
  references with this man."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Surely, Mr. Tupperwill, you're exaggerating a very insignificant
  incident?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know." He shook his head. "I might have been driven into that
  yard and murdered! You may laugh, young lady. Laughter is the prerogative of
  youth, but fear is the instinct of age... I must write that down: it is
  almost epigrammatical."</p>

  <p>Apparently, in his agitation, he had decided to drop all discussion of
  Jessie Dame and her delinquencies, and he left Elsa to piece together the
  fragments of his disjointed references to the girl.</p>

  <p>The car dropped her in Wood Street, and she went back to the office, a
  little mystified, to find the sinister man sitting before her typewriter,
  laboriously tapping out a letter with one finger.</p>

  <p>"Where is the 'h'?" he asked, without looking up.</p>

  <p>She touched the key.</p>

  <p>"Had a nice journey? Tupperwill ought to buy a new car."</p>

  <p>"How did you know we went by car?"</p>

  <p>"Feng Ho saw you," he said. "Did you notice Tupperwill's new
  chauffeur?"</p>

  <p>"I saw the back of his head."</p>

  <p>He laughed softly to himself.</p>

  <p>"You should take a good look at his neck."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>He did not satisfy her curiosity, but, with a shudder, she knew
  instinctively that behind that pleasant laugh was grim menace.</p>

  <p>"What a horrible idea!" she said, shivering.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is, rather. I'm sorry. And yet a murderer's neck fascinates
  me."</p>

  <p>"A murderer?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"I rather think so." He was still tapping his painful way through the
  alphabet. "That chauffeur killed Maurice Tarn."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap41"

  <p class="first">"AT least, that is my view," he said, without looking up
  from the machine at the white-faced girl. "Where is the 'j'? I can never find
  the 'j' on these machines. Oh, here it is! Yes, a stalwart man, with a beard
  and motor-goggles? Beard and motor-goggles are attached&mdash;and the beard
  is really clever. It is fixed to a silk lining that fits his chin as a glove
  fits your finger."</p>

  <p>He was not looking at her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was our friend," he went on pleasantly. "How far did you
  go?"</p>

  <p>She described the journey, and told him of the curious little incident of
  the open gate.</p>

  <p>"I thought Mr. Tupperwill was unnecessarily alarmed," she said.</p>

  <p>"Not unnecessarily," Amery answered gently. "Oh no, not unnecessarily! If
  the car had passed through that gateway, Mr. Tupperwill would not be alive at
  this moment. Or, if he were alive, he would be in such a grievous plight that
  he would welcome a merciful end."</p>

  <p>"Are you serious, Major Amery?" He looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've alarmed you. Yes, I was quite serious."</p>

  <p>"But does Mr. Tupperwill know the character of this man?" she asked in
  horror.</p>

  <p>"He will be warned before the day is out. You didn't see the chauffeur's
  face?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I caught a glimpse of him. The driver's seat is enclosed in Mr.
  Tupperwill's car, and it is rather difficult to see him. I only noticed that
  he was a very powerful-looking man, and I thought it strange that he wore a
  beard. Do you really know him?"</p>

  <p>"The chauffeur? Yes, a gentleman named Stillman. A powerful-looking
  fellow, eh? He is all that. What did he want to see you
  about&mdash;Tupperwill, I mean?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason why you shouldn't know," she said at last. "It was
  about Miss Dame."</p>

  <p>He inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"I thought it might be," he said surprisingly.</p>

  <p>"What would have happened to me?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"You?" He got up slowly from his chair, slipped the page he was typing
  from the machine, tore it into four parts and threw it into the wastepaper
  basket, before he replied: "I don't think anything very bad would have
  happened to you, but you might have been scared."</p>

  <p>"Then only Mr. Tupperwill was in danger?"</p>

  <p>"In real danger&mdash;yes. Danger of life or limb, and that's the only
  kind that counts. When are you contemplating taking tea with Miss Dame?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I'm not at all anxious to go."</p>

  <p>"Go this evening," he said. "The 'pater' will interest you." Her anxiety
  did not prevent her smiling.</p>

  <p>"You know how she refers to him, then?"</p>

  <p>He walked into his room and she followed. There was one question she
  wanted settled beyond all doubt.</p>

  <p>"Major Amery," she began, "do you remember the night that Mr. Tupperwill
  was attacked?"</p>

  <p>"I remember it perfectly."</p>

  <p>"You know that I found the weapon in your cupboard?"</p>

  <p>"I also know that."</p>

  <p>"It was you who struck him?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was I. That your mind may be set at rest, it was an accident. The
  blow was not intended for Mr. Tupperwill, and I had not the slightest idea
  that he was within range of my stick when I struck. And now let us forget
  that very unpleasant incident."</p>

  <p>It occurred to Elsa, when she made known her intention, that Jessie Dame
  was not too pleased at the prospect of entertaining her friend.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether it will be convenient to-night," she said, and Elsa,
  who was quite ready to accept any excuse for dropping the project, was glad
  enough to murmur something about "some other evening" and make her
  escape.</p>

  <p>But the visit was not to be postponed. Just as she was on the point of
  leaving, Jessie Dame appeared, already dressed for the street.</p>

  <p>"I've been out to telephone to pater," she said breathlessly, "and he says
  he'll be very glad to see you. We'll take a taxi home, if you don't
  mind."</p>

  <p>At any other time this extravagance on the part of the romantic young lady
  would have startled the girl, but the information which she had acquired
  about the wealth of the Dames made misgiving unnecessary.</p>

  <p>The Dames' house was one of a dozen stucco dwellings in a short cul-de-sac
  off Ladbroke Grove. It had a tiny patch of grass lawn before the house, the
  inevitable laurel bushes planted near the railings, and the six steps up to
  the front door, which are peculiar to houses built at that period of
  Victorian history when English and American architects were apparently
  obsessed with the idea that London and New York might be flooded at any
  moment, and that it was necessary to build the ground floors ten feet above
  the level of the street.</p>

  <p>No sooner was Elsa inside the house than she realized that Jessie Dame was
  living in a much better style than she had imagined. The room into which she
  was shown was substantially, even handsomely, appointed, and if it erred at
  all, it was on the side of lavishness and over-ornamentation.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell pater you're here," said Miss Dame, hurrying out of the room,
  to return after a considerable time with the bald and florid man whom Elsa
  had seen at the dance.</p>

  <p>The first thing that struck her was the accuracy of Major Amery's
  description. The eyes were pale, the jaw full and fleshy, and the moustache
  was patently dyed. But for this, and his complete baldness, Mr. Dame did not
  look old enough to be Jessie's father, for his complexion was flawless.</p>

  <p>"Glad to know you, Miss Marlowe," he said.</p>

  <p>The voice was harsh, like that of a man suffering from a cold.</p>

  <p>"I have been expecting you to come over with Jess before. Come and have a
  look at the house."</p>

  <p>He was undisguisedly proud of his establishment, and not until he had
  shown her over every room and into the immaculate kitchen was he satisfied.
  To maintain a polite interest through three floors of inspection would have
  been a tax at any ordinary time, but there was something about this house and
  the personality of its owner that interested the girl. She could endure the
  procession from one spare room to another without fatigue, and could honestly
  admire the economy of the kitchen equipment.</p>

  <p>"No expense has been spared," said Mr. Dame complacently. "It's a home, as
  I have often told Jess, that she ought to be proud of and ask no questions...
  what I mean to say is, that she ought to be content with what she's got.
  Don't you think so, miss?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly do," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>Evidently Jessie had moments of curiosity and unease, thought the girl, as
  she followed the proud owner into the garden.</p>

  <p>It was a long strip of land, and it showed the practised hand of a skilled
  horticulturist. Again no expense had been spared to produce, within the
  limits of Mr. Dame's modest estate, the best effects that money could
  buy.</p>

  <p>"That's the garage," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the garden, running its width, was a one storeyed shed,
  substantially built, and lighted by two small windows placed just under the
  overhanging roof. As they looked, the door opened and a man lounged through,
  carrying a spade. Stripped to his shirt, he was wiping his forehead with a
  bare arm as he came into the cooler air, and for an instant he did not
  observe Mr. Dame and his visitor. Then, almost at the second that Elsa
  recognized him, he scuttled back into the shed and slammed the door behind
  him. Quick as he was, Elsa recognised the labourer.</p>

  <p>It was the bearded chauffeur, the murderer of Maurice Tarn!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap42"
     id="chap42">XLII. THE SIGNER OF CHEQUES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. DAME had not noticed the incident. At the moment he was
  drawing attention to the tiny rock garden, and he did not observe that the
  girl was staring at the shed.</p>

  <p>"Is that a garage?" she found her voice to ask.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's a garage," replied Mr. Dame shortly. "The entrance is on the
  other side. There's a lane at the back. You must come here in the summer,
  miss, and see my roses..."</p>

  <p>Had he noticed her white face? she wondered, for the shock had sent every
  vestige of colour from her cheeks.</p>

  <p>Apparently Mr. Dame was so absorbed in the pride of possession that he had
  no eyes for aught to which he could not lay claim, and by the time the tinkle
  of a bell summoned them to the ornate dining-room, where tea had been laid,
  she had recovered her self-possession.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of your boss, miss?" demanded Jessie Dame's
  father, nonchalantly pouring half the contents of his cup into the saucer. "A
  regular mystery?"</p>

  <p>Elsa was not inclined to discuss the sinister man with anybody, least of
  all with an acquaintance of a few minutes.</p>

  <p>"They tell me the life he leads you girls is perfectly hellish," Dame went
  on. "I keep telling Jessie to throw up the job and come home, but she's one
  of those obstinate girls that will have their own way. Oh, woman, woman!"</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was his triteness, or the string of commonplaces, that reminded
  her for a second of Mr. Tupperwill. Except that she liked the stout banker,
  and disliked this man with his furtive, cold blue eyes, most intensely.</p>

  <p>"You have a car, Mr. Dame?" she asked, anxious to keep off the subject of
  Amery.</p>

  <p>"I haven't but I'm getting one. I've had the garage built three or four
  years, but never used it. In fact, I haven't been inside the place for a
  year."</p>

  <p>"Father doesn't like anybody to go into the garage," said Jessie. "He says
  he won't let anybody enter until he's got a car to see. I wonder he hasn't
  bought it before."</p>

  <p>"All in good time; everything comes to he who waits," said Mr. Dame
  complacently.</p>

  <p>When at last the time came for the girl to go, Jessie accompanied her to
  the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of the pater?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He's a very interesting man," said Elsa safely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's pretty interesting," said Jessie, without any trace of
  enthusiasm. "I suppose you're going home now? It must be nice to live
  alone."</p>

  <p>Elsa looked at the girl quickly. There was something wistful in her eyes
  and in her voice, a human quality that momentarily transfigured her. Only for
  a flash, and then she was herself again.</p>

  <p>"Come down and see us any time you want a cup of tea. The pater will be
  glad to show you over the garden," she said, and, running up the steps,
  closed the door almost before Elsa had left the gate.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dame was waiting in the dining-room when his daughter came back to
  him, and he was carefully carving off the end of a cigar.</p>

  <p>"That's her, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's her. Why were you so anxious to see her, father?"</p>

  <p>"'Why was I so anxious to see her, father?'" he mimicked. "You get out of
  the habit of asking questions, will you? Now what have you got for me?"</p>

  <p>She went to the side table where she had put her attache case when she
  came in, opened it and took out a few sheets of crumpled paper, which she
  passed to him.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" he demanded wrathfully.</p>

  <p>"It was all I could find," she said. "I got them out of the wastepaper
  basket."</p>

  <p>"Didn't he write any other letters?"</p>

  <p>"He may have done," said the girl. "Father, I think he's suspicious. Up to
  now the letters have come to me to be entered in the despatch book before
  they were posted. This afternoon he kept back all his own letters, and when I
  sent the office boy to ask for them, he said he was posting them himself in
  future."</p>

  <p>The man scowled from his daughter to the crumpled typewritten sheets in
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"These are all the same letter," he said. "What is the use of them to
  me?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, father. I've done all I could," said Miss Dame quietly.
  "I'm sure there are times when I feel ashamed to look him in the face, prying
  and sneaking as I do; and if Miss Marlowe only knew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up about Miss Marlowe 'only knowing,'" he said gruffly. "What I want
  to know is, why haven't I got his letters?"</p>

  <p>"I've told you," said the girl with an air of desperation. "I can't take
  them out of his hand and copy them, can I? It was easy when they came to me
  to be entered, but he's stopped that now, and I'll have to do as I did
  before&mdash;get any scraps I can from the wastepaper basket."</p>

  <p>He was reading the letter carefully, word by word, his stubby finger
  following the lines.</p>

  <p>"F.O.I.&mdash;what's that?" he muttered to himself. "All right, Jessie,
  you can go up to your room. Be dressed by seven o'clock and I'll take you out
  and give you some dinner."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to go to-night."</p>

  <p>"What you want to do and what I want you to do are two different things,"
  he shouted, "Get dressed!"</p>

  <p>Jessie Dame ran like a scared rabbit, and when, three-quarters of an hour
  later, she came down to the dining-room, she saw that he was still in his day
  suit.</p>

  <p>"I've changed my mind about taking you out," he said. "You must go by
  yourself. And sign these before you go."</p>

  <p>There were three blank cheques on the table; they were upon Stebbing's
  Bank, and, taking up the pen, she signed, in her angular writing, "H.
  Stillman," blotted them and gave them back to him.</p>

  <p>"Is there nothing else, father?" she asked timidly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is something else. You'll dine at the Cardinal and go on to
  the Mispah about half-past nine. If anybody asks you where I am, you can tell
  them that I'm on the premises somewhere. You'll stay at the Mispah till two
  o'clock. You've always said that you like being with classy
  people&mdash;well, you'll stay with 'em a little later to-night. You
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, father," she said meekly.</p>

  <p>"I don't want you back a minute before two."</p>

  <p>"Yes, father," she said again, picked up her cloak from the chair and went
  out. And none would guess, seeing the misery in her face, that Jessie Dame
  was sallying forth to the desirable association of classy people.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap43"
     id="chap43">XLIII. MR. TUPPERWILL SEEKS ADVICE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LONG after Elsa had left the office, Major Amery was sitting
  at his desk, his swift pen covering sheet after sheet of foolscap. He wrote a
  beautiful clear, almost copperplate hand, and with a rapidity which, in all
  the circumstances, was remarkable.</p>

  <p>He had come to the bottom of the sixth sheet when there was a gentle tap
  on his door, and, rising, he crossed the floor, turned the key and pulled the
  door open. It was the night watchman who was in charge of the premises
  between business hours.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir; I didn't want to disturb you, but there's a
  gentleman wishes to see you&mdash;Mr. Tupperwill."</p>

  <p>Amery looked at his watch: it was half-past six.</p>

  <p>"Show him up, please," he said, and, going back to his desk, put his
  writing away in a drawer and swung round in his chair to face the door
  through which Mr. Tupperwill presently came.</p>

  <p>The banker was obviously ill at ease. He closed the door behind him and
  stood behind the chair to which Amery pointed, his hands resting on the back,
  grotesquely reminiscent of a budding politician about to make his maiden
  speech.</p>

  <p>"You will think this visit is remarkable, Major Amery," he began huskily,
  "particularly since I cannot claim to be&mdash;ah&mdash;a very close friend,
  or even an intimate acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"I was expecting you to come," said Amery shortly. "Won't you sit
  down?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill lifted the tails of his frock coat and sat gingerly. "The
  truth is, I am in such confusion of mind that I hardly know which way to
  turn, whose advice to seek; and thinking matters over in the privacy of my
  office, I decided that you, as a man of the world, and a man, moreover, of
  vast experience beyond my range, would perhaps be able to assist me in
  forming a conclusion. Major Amery, I am beset by enemies&mdash;and if that
  sounds to you a little highly coloured and melodramatic, I beg that you will
  bear with me for a little while. The matter which I will ask your patience to
  discuss affects not only the honour of my name, but the very foundations of
  my business."</p>

  <p>He stopped and licked his dry lips. Amery made no reply; he sat, tense and
  alert, waiting for what was to follow.</p>

  <p>"You were good enough, at a moment when I was extremely angry, to make a
  prediction, which, alas! seems upon the point of fulfilment," Mr. Tupperwill
  went on. "That prediction, in effect, was that a certain client of the bank
  would drag me and my business into the mud. I fear, I very greatly fear, that
  your prediction is within measurable distance of fulfilment. Major Amery, I
  have trusted a certain person beyond limits that a banker and a business man
  can safely go. I have been deceived. The bank has been the victim of the
  grossest duplicity; and now, not only is my fortune, but my very life,
  threatened, as the result of my stupendous folly.</p>

  <p>"Two years ago I was at the head of a flourishing commercial concern,
  respected and honoured throughout the City of London..."</p>

  <p>"Two years ago," interrupted Amery, "you were at the head of a bankrupt
  business, which was maintained in existence by the falsification of
  accounts!"</p>

  <p>His words fell like hammer blows upon steel,</p>

  <p>"Stebbing's has been insolvent for years," he went on remorselessly. "It
  is your boast that you defied the efforts of the joint stock banks to absorb
  you. The truth is, that you dare not allow an impartial investigation into
  the affairs of Stebbing's, knowing well that honest auditors would bring you
  into the criminal court, and eventually into one of His Majesty's
  prisons."!</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill did not change colour, but there was a pathetic droop to
  his lip and an almost tearful entreaty in his eyes, as he blinked stupidly at
  his accuser.</p>

  <p>"I hope that what you say is not true," he said in a hushed voice. "If it
  is, then indeed I have been more grossly deceived than I imagined, and there
  has been a conspiracy to deceive me. It is true that I am in a bad way.
  Certain indiscretions, which came to the knowledge of an unscrupulous man,
  have placed me in his power. The circumstances I have put down in black and
  white," he said impressively, "and I have come to you to ask you whether, if
  that document were placed in your hands, it would be of any service to you or
  to me?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," said Amery promptly, and Mr. Tupperwill's face fell.</p>

  <p>"On the last occasion we met, you referred to a gentleman named
  &mdash;ah&mdash;Stillman. Now, Major Amery, I wish to avoid unpleasantness; I
  wish to avoid&mdash;ruin! You, knowing so much, can advise me. It may be that
  this is the last time that you and I will ever discuss this matter, the last
  opportunity for adjustment."</p>

  <p>Amery looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"There will be other opportunities," he said.</p>

  <p>Before the interview ended Mr. Tupperwill had something to say.</p>

  <p>"I am a man of peace. The violent expressions of human feeling are
  repugnant, indeed terrifying, to me. I have had one horrible experience, and
  do not wish that to be repeated."</p>

  <p>He touched the scar on his head feelingly.</p>

  <p>"And yet I have the sensation that I am drifting into a welter of
  violence. That I am surrounded by unscrupulous, evil, possibly cruel men, who
  will not hesitate to wreak their vengeance on me, and I am appealing to you,
  as a man of action, for help and guidance. Major Amery, a week ago I engaged
  a new chauffeur. The man came to me with the most excellent credentials; he
  had a character from the Army, he had eulogistic recommendations from
  previous employers, and as a chauffeur he is everything that I could desire,
  except"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"I cannot escape a suspicion that he is not
  what he seems. The man has come in and out of my house without let or
  hindrance, and my butler informs me that on one occasion he has found him in
  my bedroom."</p>

  <p>Leaning forward, he went on, in a lower voice.</p>

  <p>"In my bedroom is a wall safe, in which I keep a few important papers, a
  number of trinkets of no especial value, and this morning I missed a small
  book, containing particulars of my private account. It was not an ordinary
  book: it has the appearance of a gold case, and was presented to me by my
  dear father many years ago."</p>

  <p>"What is in the book besides your accounts?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. A number of addresses, a few memoranda about our family fortune,
  particulars of the combination of my safe at the office, my private deposits
  at the Bank of England, and suchlike."</p>

  <p>"If you think this man has stolen it," said Amery with a weary sigh, "why
  don't you call in the police?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Tupperwill raised his eyes slowly to the other's.</p>

  <p>"You have told me my business is bankrupt; you have taunted me with the
  fact that I dare not allow independent investigation; you have suggested that
  there are secrets about Stebbing's which could not be revealed. One or two of
  those secrets are in that book, Major Amery."</p>

  <p>He rose with a long-drawn sigh. "I fear I have wearied you," he said, "but
  remember that I am a man torn with anxiety and doubt, a man placed in the
  most cruel dilemma. Your advice, your help, your co-operation would have
  meant much to me, and perhaps much to you."</p>

  <p>He brushed his silk hat on his sleeve in an absent-minded way, looked
  thoughtfully at the shattered face of the cupboard by the side of the
  fireplace, and then, with another sigh and a little bow, waddled out, a
  picture of dejection and misery.</p>

  <p>Amery sat listening to his footfalls until there was silence in the
  office. Then he lit a thin black cigar and blew a cloud of smoke to the
  ceiling. A deep frown furrowed his forehead; his expression was one of
  irritation. Nobody would have guessed that his mind was wholly concentrated
  upon Elsa Marlowe.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap44"
     id="chap44">XLIV. MAJOR AMERY GOES OUT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE church bells were striking seven when he walked out into
  Wood Street and, reaching Cheapside, allowed three taxis to pass him before
  he called the fourth.</p>

  <p>Before he could put his hand upon the bell of his door it was opened by
  Feng Ho, who followed him into his study.</p>

  <p>"Do you know a man named Jarvie?"</p>

  <p>Amery nodded.</p>

  <p>"He was arrested this afternoon. He and a man named Samson."</p>

  <p>Amery nodded again.</p>

  <p>"Bickerson is busy," he said. "One supposes that the fall of Dr. Ralph
  Hallam is very near at hand."</p>

  <p>"If I had my way he should sleep on the Terraces of the Night," said Feng
  Ho murderously. They were speaking in the Chinese dialect, the Chinaman
  standing by the desk, looking down at his master as he went over his
  letters.</p>

  <p>"That is a heavy punishment for folly, Feng Ho."</p>

  <p>"For murder, master," said Feng Ho. "For this Hallam killed the old man.
  Was I not in the room, searching, when he came in? Did I not hear, with my
  remarkable ears, the 'swiff!' of the knife as it came from his pocket? I
  think I was a fool to have turned out the lights when I came into the house,
  but it was very tempting. The control switch is just inside the door below
  the stairs, and I turned it out because I wanted to make sure whether the old
  man was awake. If he had been the lights going out would have brought him on
  to the landing."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, you're wrong. The man who killed Tarn was Stillman."</p>

  <p>The Chinaman clucked his lips impatiently, but made no other comment. He
  followed his master upstairs, and, while he was in his bath, laid out Amery's
  dress suit. The sinister man had nearly finished his dressing before he gave
  his instructions.</p>

  <p>"I shall be in Box One&mdash;that is the box nearest to the stage. Get me
  the Listener."</p>

  <p>Feng Ho found a small flat black box in a drawer, and, bulky as it was,
  Amery put it in the tail pocket of his dress coat.</p>

  <p>"And a gun," said Amery.</p>

  <p>Feng Ho produced from the same receptacle a short, heavy Browning, snapped
  home the magazine, and, pulling back the jacket, fastened the safety
  catch.</p>

  <p>"This is better," he said.</p>

  <p>As if by magic, there appeared in his hand a short broad knife with a
  lacquered handle. He stropped it tenderly on his palm, and, stooping, picked
  up a piece of tissue paper that had come out of Amery's collar-box, rolled it
  into a ball and threw it into the air.</p>

  <p>As it fell, the knife flickered and the paper ball fell in two parts.</p>

  <p>"'All men fear steel,'" he quoted the old Cantonese proverb with some
  smugness. "It is silent and swift and very satisfactory."</p>

  <p>Major Amery smiled.</p>

  <p>"So I should think," he said drily, "but I will take the gun." He pushed
  it into his hip pocket. "And now get me sandwiches and a glass of Tokay. Have
  the car in the little street that runs by Covent Garden Market. You'd better
  be in the crowd before the portico. There is always a throng to see people
  going into the Opera."</p>

  <p>He finished his apology for a dinner, then he took up the telephone and
  called a Treasury number.</p>

  <p>"Is that Scotland Yard? I want to speak to Superintendent Wille."</p>

  <p>After a long delay, a voice answered him which he knew was not the
  Superintendent's.</p>

  <p>"Major Amery," he said, in answer to the enquiry.</p>

  <p>After another little wait, there was a click, and Wille's gruff voice
  greeted him curtly.</p>

  <p>"It is Major Amery speaking. I have an important statement to make to the
  police, and I wish to see Mr. Bickerson at my house at eleven o'clock."</p>

  <p>"What is it about?" asked Wille.</p>

  <p>"I think I would rather tell Bickerson. He is in charge of the case."</p>

  <p>"A dope story, eh? All right, I'll get in touch with him and send him to
  you."</p>

  <p>"At eleven o'clock," said Amery, and hung up the receiver with a little
  smile.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>The news of Jarvie's arrest had come to Ralph Hallam like a thunderclap,
  and when it had been followed by a long-distance phone call from Hull,
  telling him that a second member of the gang had been taken, he was almost
  panic-stricken. That evening he spent an uncomfortable hour locked in his
  room, burning papers and small account-books, and it was nine o'clock before
  he remembered that he had promised to call on Lou, and that she would be
  waiting for him.</p>

  <p>He found his wife fuming.</p>

  <p>"I'm supposed to be going to dinner," she said shrilly. "Haven't you got
  any clocks in your house?"</p>

  <p>"Go to supper instead," he snarled. "Where is the girl?"</p>

  <p>"In her room," snapped Mrs. Hallam, "where she spends all her evenings. Is
  she staying here for life?"</p>

  <p>"She'll be going in a day or two. Come in here."</p>

  <p>He opened the drawing-room door and almost dragged her in.</p>

  <p>"Now listen, Lou: I'm in a pretty bad way. There is trouble&mdash;police
  trouble&mdash;and it will require all my ingenuity to crawl out of the
  wreckage when my affairs collapse, as they will very shortly. I have a little
  ready money, but I want a whole lot, and you've got to help me all you can,
  unless you wish your allowance to drop dead."</p>

  <p>"What is all this?" she asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Now listen," She saw he was in deadly earnest. "I want you to stay here
  till eleven o'clock, then you can go out to supper. You were going to the
  Mispah, weren't you? There's a late dance. Stay till it breaks&mdash;that
  will be two in the morning."</p>

  <p>She shot a suspicious glance at him.</p>

  <p>"I see," she said, and he would have been dense if he had missed the sneer
  in her tone.</p>

  <p>"No harm is coming to the girl: you need have no fear of that," he assured
  her.</p>

  <p>"Even that wouldn't keep me awake at night," she said callously. "But I
  think you're well advised, Ralph, not to go too far there. She's got a letter
  for you."</p>

  <p>His mouth opened in amazement.</p>

  <p>"A letter for me? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"The maid found it under her pillow this morning, addressed to Dr. Ralph
  Hallam, and in Amery's handwriting. On the top of the envelope are the words,
  'To be used in emergency,' You're looking a little white, Ralph. What has he
  got on you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the man roughly. "How do you know it is his?"</p>

  <p>"If I didn't know, I'd guess," she said coolly. "He put his initials to
  the last remark&mdash;P.A. So I warn you, go slow!"</p>

  <p>"I tell you no harm will come to the girl. It isn't the girl I want at
  all; it is something else. I've thought it all out, Lou. Suppose I appear in
  the middle of the night, she'll think all sorts of things, and when I say
  that I just want to look at the box, she'll be glad enough to let me take it
  out."</p>

  <p>"What is in the box?" she asked curiously. "I looked into it the other
  day; the bottom part is screwed down. Do you want me to stay on till eleven?
  Is that necessary?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It will be better if she thinks you're here. I can explain to her later
  that you've gone out. What is she doing?"</p>

  <p>"Listening to that darned monkey-box," she said impatiently, and then:
  "Very well, I will do as you ask. Do you want anything?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except a key. She has mine."</p>

  <p>She handed him a flat key, and he put it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Wait. Before you go, I'd like to hear some more about this crash and
  wreck and crawling out that you were talking about when you came in. Ralph,
  what's your game? Are you dope-running?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"How did you guess?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It's the only kind of crime so free from danger that you'd take it on,"
  she said quietly. "Tarn was in it too, wasn't he? I thought so. And is
  Tupperwill?"</p>

  <p>"Tupperwill!" he said contemptuously. "I don't think he's got too much
  money, but he's straight enough."</p>

  <p>She laughed quietly.</p>

  <p>"That idea struck me too&mdash;I mean, about his having no money. Even if
  he does have his books bound in gold&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She checked herself as she saw his piercing eye upon her.</p>

  <p>"I peeped into his library when I was there," she went on glibly. "He's
  certainly a highbrow reader."</p>

  <p>She saw him out and shut the door on him, then came back to her bedroom,
  opened a little drawer and took out a shining gold object, that might have
  been mistaken for a bloated cigarette case, but was, in fact, a small
  note-book bound between golden covers. She turned the thin leaves with a
  contemptuous curl of her lip, and threw the thing back in her drawer. She had
  taken a lot of trouble and a considerable risk for nothing, and there was
  certainly more satisfaction in surveying (as she did with pride) a brilliant
  diamond sunburst that she had acquired during her visit to India.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock she knocked at Elsa's door and went in, without invitation,
  since she had learnt by experience that an enthusiastic listener-in cannot
  hear anything but the sounds which are coming from the ether.</p>

  <p>Elsa took off her headphones with a smile.</p>

  <p>"It is very beautiful. I wonder you don't listen, Mrs. Hallam," she said.
  "Are you going out?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Lou mendaciously. "I haven't quite made up my mind
  what to do. You are all right here?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," said Elsa. "Please don't worry about me. And, Mrs. Hallam, I
  think I have found a flat for myself. I don't want to inflict myself upon you
  a day longer than is necessary."</p>

  <p>"You're welcome," said Lou Hallam mechanically. "Just stay as long as you
  like, my dear."</p>

  <p>She looked down at the box against the wall.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you have that old thing put into my lumber-room?" she asked.
  "It takes up a lot of space."</p>

  <p>"I think it had better stay here until I go," said Elsa, and thereafter
  the conversation drifted into awkward pauses, the girl anxious to get back to
  her opera, Mrs. Hallam just as anxious to begin her dressing.</p>

  <p>At last an excuse came: the telephone bell rang in the dining-room, and
  Mrs. Hallam went out. It was Ralph.</p>

  <p>"You might keep your eye on the street outside," he said. "If you see
  anybody who is apparently watching the house, will you let me know?"</p>

  <p>"Are you scared of that?" she asked, and was cursed for her insolence.</p>

  <p>When Elsa resumed her listening, she discovered that the broadcasting
  station had switched over. She listened to weather reports, the latest news,
  barometer readings and the like.</p>

  <p>"In a quarter of an hour," said the voice from nowhere, "we shall switch
  you over to the Opera House and you will hear the last act of 'Faust.'"</p>

  <p>She put down the headphones and took up a book, trying to read. But her
  mind was elsewhere, as it had been even as she listened to Gounod's
  masterpiece. There was something very fascinating about the sinister man, but
  it wasn't the fascination that the spectacle of perversity exercises. She
  felt that she had penetrated the outer layer of his nature, and had learnt
  something of the real man which lay beneath. He puzzled her, he frightened
  her, but he never revolted her. Her keen woman's instinct had vibrated to the
  fineness of his character, and whatever were his offences, his wrongdoings,
  she felt he was a good man. It was so absurd a conclusion that she almost
  laughed.</p>

  <p>And yet he was good, and, despite his bearishness, kindly, and, behind his
  suspicions, trustful. She could not understand him; he was a man who must be
  taken in the whole, his faults accepted, his delinquencies excused. She
  wondered how many women had fallen in love with him, or whether any had had
  the vision to get beneath the unpleasing surface and find something
  worshipful. Not that she worshipped him, she told herself hastily, or even
  loved him. She wasn't sure, now that she came to analyze her mind, that she
  liked him. This was sliding on a treacherous surface, she decided, and took
  up her headphones in time to hear the burst of applause that followed the
  opening aria.</p>

  <p>The reception was perfect; it almost seemed as if she were sitting in a
  box within a few feet of the stage. Every note, every delicate cadence, was
  clearly marked.</p>

  <p>Marguerite was singing when, of a sudden, the voice died down, and instead
  came a hubbub of sound which she could not understand. A voice said: "Go
  away&mdash;get off the stage!" And then another spoke thunderously in her
  ears.</p>

  <p>"Elsa!"</p>

  <p>She gasped. It was the voice of Major Amery.</p>

  <p>"Elsa, lock your door and barricade it. Admit nobody! Do you hear? Lock
  your door immediately. You are in the deadliest danger!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap45"
     id="chap45">XLV. THE ALARM CALL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ALMOST at the back of his box Major Amery sat, listening,
  and yet not listening, to the delicious harmonies of the opera. The box next
  to him was empty. Twice he had opened the little black box, and taken out
  something which looked like a stethoscope, the disc end of which he had
  applied to the wall. No sound came from the box, until the curtain had gone
  up on the last act of "Faust." Then, without the aid of his apparatus, he
  heard a sound of chairs being moved. Two men had come into the box, and he
  judged, from the location of their voices, that they, too, were sitting well
  back from observation. He put the receiver to the wall and listened,
  immediately recognizing the two voices.</p>

  <p>"... she is the biggest card to play. We may be able to pull off a hundred
  to one chance if you get her..."</p>

  <p>The second voice mumbled something, and then:</p>

  <p>"... I had thought of that. We can kill two birds with one stone. The
  stuff is in the box of course? The old man took it away from Stanford's the
  night before his death and brought it to his place in Elgin Crescent... It is
  all American stuff, and easy to change, but I must have the girl as well... I
  have arranged that... eleven o'clock... five minutes to eleven... I believe
  in working to a time-table."</p>

  <p>There was a silence, and at that moment Amery incautiously jerked at the
  thin wire connecting the microphone with the small battery at the bottom of
  the black box. The wire snapped. Instantly his capable fingers were stripping
  the silk covering from either end, and a new junction was made. But when he
  put the receiver to the wall, there was a silence. He thought for a moment
  that the battery had gone wrong, and, dropping the earpieces, he stepped out
  into the corridor and opened the door of the next box stealthily. It was
  empty!</p>

  <p>"Five minutes to eleven!"</p>

  <p>And they worked to schedule! He looked at his watch and gasped. It was
  exactly that hour.</p>

  <p>Only for a second did he hesitate. Marguerite was in the centre of the
  stage, enthralling the silent audience with her glorious voice but he did not
  see her, did not hear her. All he knew was that, somewhere in London, a
  defenceless girl was listening-in, and in another second he had leapt from
  his box to the stage.</p>

  <p>Immediately the house was in an uproar. Marguerite fell back aifrighted,
  on the verge of tears; fierce voices called to him from the wings; but he was
  walking along the footlights, looking for the microphone, and then he found
  it and, stooping, shouted his warning. In another second strong arms had
  gripped him and pulled him back out of sight, and he was facing an enraged
  manager.</p>

  <p>"Send for a policeman," said a shrill voice. "He's drunk!" Two stalwart
  stage hands were holding his arms; the manager, almost hysterical with rage,
  was shaking his fist in the expressionless face; and then Amery said:</p>

  <p>"Take me to your office. I've something to say to you."</p>

  <p>"You can say it here!" screamed the theatrical man. "How dare you, you
  scoundrel!"</p>

  <p>Amery said something in a low voice and the man's expression changed.</p>

  <p>"You're probably bluffing, but come along," he said gruffly, and the
  sinister man followed him to a little office behind the stage.</p>

  <p>There was a telephone on the table, and, without asking permission, Amery
  took it up.</p>

  <p>He got through to his objective, and for three minutes he was speaking
  rapidly, fiercely, whilst the dazed manager listened, dumbfounded. Presently
  he put the instrument down.</p>

  <p>"The way out&mdash;quick!"</p>

  <p>The manager piloted him down and up stairs, along narrow corridors, and
  finally into the street.</p>

  <p>"I'll help you find your car&mdash;do you want any assistance?"</p>

  <p>Amery shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Herbert Mansions," he said, as he sprang on the footboard and took his
  place by the driver's side. "Go slow as you go round the corner: I want to
  pick up Feng Ho. After that, there are no traffic regulations in London for
  me to-night!"</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Elsa heard the words and listened, stunned, for a moment beyond
  comprehension. It was the voice of the sinister man, warning her to lock her
  door... she was in danger!</p>

  <p>She tore the phones from her head, ran to the door and turned the key,
  and, as she did so, she heard a rustling sound outside and the handle turned
  in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" she asked, affrighted.</p>

  <p>And then there came to her ears a scream that ended in a stifled sob, a
  scream that turned her blood to water.</p>

  <p>"Help!"</p>

  <p>It was Lou Hallam's scream that rose and died to a gurgle, She thought she
  was going to faint, but, calling into play all her will power, she pulled at
  the box and set it against the door. In another minute the little bedstead
  had been wrenched across the room and wedged against the box.</p>

  <p>"Open, I want to come in," said a muffled voice.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Open the door, I tell you. I won't hurt you. I want the box. Give me the
  box and I swear to you that I will do no harm."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she asked again. "Where is Mrs. Hallam? What have you done
  to her?"</p>

  <p>She heard a muffled curse, and then the door shook under his weight.</p>

  <p>There were two men there now: she heard them in consultation. What should
  she do? She ran to the window and threw it open. The street below was
  deserted. There was no escape that way. If she could only see somebody
  &mdash;somebody to whom she could appeal.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hallam's flat was on the third floor, and escape from this direction
  was impossible. Presently she saw a figure crossing the road, and
  screamed.</p>

  <p>"Stop that!" cried a voice from the passage, hoarse with anger and fear.
  "Stop shouting, or I'll shoot!"</p>

  <p>At that moment the panel smashed in, and she saw a pair of eyes glaring at
  her malevolently and shrank back.</p>

  <p>It was just then that the whine of a car came to her ears. She looked out
  again: the machine had stopped at the door; three men were getting out and
  were racing up the flagged path to the vestibule. The assailant outside had
  heard something too.</p>

  <p>"Thank God!" she cried wildly.</p>

  <p>The man outside heard her voice; there was a rustle of footsteps in the
  passage, and then suddenly the corridor, which had been in darkness, was
  illuminated, and she heard a familiar voice.</p>

  <p>"Don't move, my friend. Unless you have an important appointment with
  Peter."</p>

  <p>It was Amery!</p>

  <p>A door slammed; it was the kitchen door, which was almost opposite her
  own, and she heard a smothered exclamation of annoyance from the Major. In
  another second she saw him, through the hole in the door, pass to the kitchen
  and switch on the lights. She saw that the outer door of the kitchen was wide
  open and that he went out to a small balcony and peered down.</p>

  <p>Then he came back.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;yes!" she quavered. "I'm quite all right. Have they gone?"</p>

  <p>"They've gone all right," was the grim reply. "There is a service lift
  from the kitchen balcony; I think they slid down the rope."</p>

  <p>She was making a feeble effort to remove the barricade, but her strength
  had suddenly evaporated, and she had to stop twice and sit down, before
  eventually she removed the final obstacle and opened the door to him.</p>

  <p>In the passage by the front door she saw Feng Ho, and a man in uniform,
  whom she recognised as Amery's chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ho, get the lady some water," said Amery shortly. "Where is Mrs.
  Hallam?"</p>

  <p>She could not speak until the water came.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, thought she had gone out," gasped the girl as she lifted
  the glass to her lips with a trembling hand, "but I heard somebody
  scream&mdash;dreadfully!"</p>

  <p>He left her and walked into the dining-room, turning on the lights. The
  room was empty. From there he passed to the drawing-room, with the same
  result.</p>

  <p>"Where does she sleep?"</p>

  <p>The girl pointed. The door of Mrs. Hallam's room was locked, and he
  rattled on the handle.</p>

  <p>"Somebody is there," he said, and flung his whole weight at the door,
  which burst open with a crash.</p>

  <p>He turned on the light and stood for a moment gazing at the sight which
  presented itself. Mrs. Hallam lay half on and half off her bed; her face was
  blue, her handsome dress was torn, there was blood on her white shoulder, but
  more menacing was the silk scarf tied about her throat.</p>

  <p>In an instant Amery was at her side and had removed the strangling
  silk.</p>

  <p>His voice brought the girl, who, at the sight of the woman's plight,
  forgot her own weakness. Together they lifted her on to the bed; and whilst
  the girl searched for brandy at his request, Major Amery made a rapid
  inspection of the apartment.</p>

  <p>In many ways it resembled his own study after the visit of the unknown
  burglars. Drawers had been opened and their contents thrown on the floor; the
  dressing-table had been swept clean.. For what had they been searching? he
  wondered. Hitherto he had not regarded Mrs. Hallam as a serious factor in the
  game. And yet this had been no wanton attack; there was a reason behind it.
  What that reason was, he was determined to discover.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes the woman recovered consciousness, staring at him
  blankly.</p>

  <p>"Was it you?" she croaked. "Oh, you devil!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head, "If you mean, was it I that attacked you, I can
  reassure you on that point," he said. "Have you lost anything?"</p>

  <p>With difficulty she got up on her feet and staggered across to the
  dressing-table.</p>

  <p>"The book is gone&mdash;that's all, the book!"</p>

  <p>"The book? What book?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"A little gold book."</p>

  <p>A light suddenly dawned on the sinister man.</p>

  <p>"Tupperwill's?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"How did you come to have it? But I can guess the answer. You took it,
  then?"</p>

  <p>She nodded again.</p>

  <p>"I borrowed it"&mdash;she explained with difficulty.</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>So that was the explanation, and a logical one!</p>

  <p>"Now, young lady"&mdash;he turned to the girl&mdash;"I think we can leave
  Mrs. Hallam for a while. I want to see you in a place of safety. Will you
  stay here for five minutes and promise not to move?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and the next instant he had disappeared. She guessed, from the
  direction he took, that he was in her room, and speculated on what took him
  there. True to his word, he was back in five minutes, carrying a suitcase
  which she recognized as her own. The thought that he had been collecting her
  clothes was so odd that she could have laughed.</p>

  <p>"I think the Palace Hotel is a very safe place for you to-night," he
  said.</p>

  <p>The girl glanced at Mrs. Hallam, who had recovered her normal pallor.</p>

  <p>"You had better ring up your husband and tell him&mdash;" he began, and
  then the sound of a key in the front door made him walk into the passage.</p>

  <p>Ralph Hallam stood stock still at the unexpected apparition of the
  sinister Amery.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap46"
     id="chap46">XLVI. THE ARREST</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"What are you doing here?" he asked harshly.</p>

  <p>"The same question might be applied to you," was the cool response.
  "Really, Hallam, you are the quickest mover I know!"</p>

  <p>"Where are you going, Elsa?" demanded Hallam.</p>

  <p>"I'll save this lady the trouble of answering you. I'm taking her to the
  Palace Hotel, where she will be safer."</p>

  <p>Ralph saw the light coming from his wife's room and strode down the
  passage. One glance he gave at the room, its tumbled contents and the pale
  face of the woman, and then he spun round.</p>

  <p>"What is the explanation of this?" he demanded. "You're not getting away
  with this, Amery."</p>

  <p>"Somebody attacked your wife and made their escape as I came in."</p>

  <p>"How did you get in?"</p>

  <p>Amery smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am going to answer no more questions to-night. I haven't the time," he
  said, and was walking to the door when Ralph stood before him.</p>

  <p>"What have you got in that suit-case?"</p>

  <p>Amery considered a second, then:</p>

  <p>"Something over a million dollars," he said coolly, "the property of Miss
  Marlowe. I found it in the bottom of her box, and I am now about to put it in
  a place of safety."</p>

  <p>Ralph's face went red and white.</p>

  <p>"You're not leaving here until you explain."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow I'll give you an explanation that will satisfy you," said
  Amery, with a touch of his old irascibility. "For the moment you've got to do
  some quick guessing. I've warned you once before, Hallam, that there isn't
  room for two crowds in your profession, and you are on the edge of finding
  how truthful I can be! Get home and lock yourself tight&mdash;or, better
  still, club a policeman and get yourself arrested. The angel of death is
  abroad to-night!"</p>

  <p>Ralph Hallam staggered against the wall and watched the two pass out of
  sight, like a man in a dream.</p>

  <p>Feng Ho was waiting outside the door, and to him Amery issued a word of
  instructions.</p>

  <p>"You will remain here; trail Hallam&mdash;I want to know where I can find
  him."</p>

  <p>They passed down the stairs into the deserted street. His chauffeur was
  turning the car, and opposite the door was a taxicab which had apparently
  just driven up, for two men stood talking to the driver. Amery's subsequent
  error was excusable.</p>

  <p>"You men come from Superintendent Wille?"</p>

  <p>"Wille? I don't know anything about Wille, but we're from Scotland Yard,"
  said one of them unpleasantly. "Are you Amery?"</p>

  <p>"That is my name."</p>

  <p>"I have a warrant for your arrest, Major."</p>

  <p>Amery looked at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>"A warrant for me? What is the charge?"</p>

  <p>"You hardly want telling that, do you? You'll find out when you get to the
  station. I have only instructions to take you into custody."</p>

  <p>There was a silence.</p>

  <p>"There is some mistake here," Amery said. "At any rate, I'll go along with
  you, but perhaps you will let me first drop this lady at the Palace
  Hotel?"</p>

  <p>The man did not answer but followed him into the taxi, handing the
  suit-case to the driver, and by the light of a street standard which flashed
  past, the prisoner caught a glimpse of a long-barrelled revolver in the
  detective's hand, The man must have known that the weapon had been seen for
  he said:</p>

  <p>"I'm giving you a word of advice, Major Amery. Don't put your hand to your
  hip pocket or you'll be shot. I'm taking no risks with you. And whilst we're
  discussing the subject&mdash;" he pressed the muzzle of the pistol against
  the other's white waistcoat and, reaching down, drew the Browning from his
  pocket. Another instant, and a circle of steel snapped about Amery's
  wrist.</p>

  <p>"Hold still or you'll get hurt," said the other man, speaking for the
  first time.</p>

  <p>The voice sounded familiar to the girl, but it was Major Amery who
  identified the man.</p>

  <p>"Can it be 'pater'?" he asked mockingly. "Really, Mr. Dame, I've misjudged
  you&mdash;I thought you did no work for a living!"</p>

  <p>Jessie Dame's father! Elsa uttered a cry as she too identified the man.
  What did it mean? Was he a detective?</p>

  <p>Amery's next words put the matter beyond all doubt.</p>

  <p>"This is a trap and I have fallen right into it," he said, "an old stager
  like me! Where are we going?"</p>

  <p>"You'll find out."</p>

  <p>She heard the jingle of Amery's handcuffs, and then a bright light pierced
  the gloom as one of their captors switched a pocket lamp upon the manacled
  hands.</p>

  <p>"'Perfectly marvellous,' as your daughter would say," sneered Amery. "No
  precautions omitted, no risks taken, eh? I see we are taking the back street
  route, and, I guess, a very circuitous one at that, but not to a police
  station, I gather? Where are we going?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"Wait and find out," growled Dame.</p>

  <p>"At least you will allow the lady to leave us?"</p>

  <p>Dame guffawed.</p>

  <p>"To go to the nearest copper and spill it?" he asked contemptuously. "Have
  a bit of sense, Major. Besides, we want her."</p>

  <p>Of course they wanted her, he remembered. She was to be the hundred to one
  chance that they were banking on.</p>

  <p>With the light on his wrists, there was no chance of ridding himself of
  the handcuffs, and he knew these characters too well to make any attempt to
  attract the attention of the very few pedestrians they passed.</p>

  <p>They had not a very long distance to go. The car passed up a street
  composed of a suburban type of house, turned into a narrow opening, and
  stopped before what looked to be a one storeyed building. The driver of the
  taxi got down, opened the door, and first Amery and then the girl were led
  into the darkness.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Scarcely had the cab disappeared carrying Amery and his captors, than Feng
  Ho flew down the sidewalk and called to the chauffeur who had just drawn up
  by the cab.</p>

  <p>"Where is the Major?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know; I'm waiting for him."</p>

  <p>"He came out this moment. Didn't you see him, oh foolish blind man?"</p>

  <p>"I saw a man and a lady, but I didn't know it was the Major. Why did he go
  off in a cab?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ho uttered something in Chinese, and at that moment he was joined by
  the ruffled Ralph Hallam.</p>

  <p>"Did you see him go, medical doctor?"</p>

  <p>"See who go?" asked the other sourly. "If you mean Amery, I didn't."</p>

  <p>He was turning to walk away when Feng Ho seized his arm and poured forth
  such a stream of voluble, pedantic English that for a time Hallam could not
  grasp his meaning.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" he asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>"They have incarcerated him, I tell you, medical sir," said the Chinaman,
  in a state of anguish.</p>

  <p>"Tell me again what you said&mdash;who is Major Amery?"</p>

  <p>And, when Feng Ho had finished, Ralph turned to the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"Which way did the cab go?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't notice, sir. You can easily find out. Drive up to the end of the
  road."</p>

  <p>It was not until Feng Ho gave the order that the chauffeur obeyed.</p>

  <p>At the end of the street they found a policeman, who had seen a cab, which
  might or might not have been that in which Amery was travelling. When, after
  five minutes' drive, they overtook the taxi, they found it was empty. Another
  clue brought as unsatisfactory an ending, and then, when Feng Ho had sent the
  car in a third direction and had himself elected to walk to the nearest
  police station, a cab came past, and he saw, by the reflected light of the
  lamp that was burning inside, a face which he immediately recognized.</p>

  <p>It was only for the fraction of a second that he saw the man. The cab was
  going at a good pace, and there was no time to recall the car. With long,
  tireless strides, Feng Ho went in pursuit. The machine drove across Bayswater
  Road, entered a narrow thoroughfare that opened into a square, and then began
  the ascent of a slight rise.</p>

  <p>He was gaining on the cab when there appeared from nowhere four men, two
  from each side of the road, and without warning they closed in upon him.
  Gasping and breathless, Feng Ho stood at bay, a knife in his hand. He drove
  the first man back, but the second caught him under his guard. He did not see
  the flicker of steel that brought him low, and, with a choking sob, he fell
  on his knees, and the man with the knife struck again.</p>

  <p>"Into that garden, quick!" hissed his assailant who had struck at him.</p>

  <p>They lifted the limp figure, and with a swing flung it over the railings.
  There was a thud as the body struck, and then silence.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>"Mind how you step," warned Dame. "Have you got that chain there?"</p>

  <p>The taxi-driver pushed past them, and Amery heard the jangle of a chain
  being passed through what he guessed was a bolt or socket of some kind. Then
  his hands were seized, something snapped on the connecting chain of the
  handcuffs, and he was drawn to the wall until the links touched what he found
  to be a steel bolt through which the chain had been drawn.</p>

  <p>"Don't you step anywhere, miss," warned Dame, "or you'll break your
  neck!"</p>

  <p>The door had been shut behind them, but even the confinement of the place
  could not account for the curiously dead sound of their voices. There was a
  splutter of flame as Dame's companion lit a lantern candle, and by its light
  Amery saw that the driver had disappeared.</p>

  <p>They were in a brick shed measuring some twenty feet by ten. He could only
  guess it was brick, because the walls were hung with dark brown Army
  blankets, and this had accounted for the unusual deadness of all sound. In
  the middle of this apartment, which was floored with cement, was a deep hole,
  as near as he could judge some five or six feet in depth, of similar length,
  and about two feet wide. It had obviously been dug by skilled hands.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" whispered the girl.</p>

  <p>She was crouching at Amery's side.</p>

  <p>"It looks like pater's garage," he said coolly. "You know what this place
  reminds me of, Dame?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want to hear anything from you," growled the man.</p>

  <p>"It reminds me of an execution shed. That hole could be made a little
  wider and a little deeper, a wooden trap, a lever for release, a stout oak
  beam and a steel winch... it's a horrible feeling to be wakened at six in the
  morning and be told to dress yourself in the clothes you wore at the trial.
  I've seen men go mad&mdash;better men than you, Dame. Ever read Wilde's
  poem&mdash;'The hangman with his gardener gloves Slips through the padded
  door, And binds one with three leathern thongs That the throat may thirst no
  more'?"</p>

  <p>"Blast you!" screamed Dame, his face livid and in his eyes a great fear.
  "I'll tear your cursed tongue out if you don't keep your mouth shut!"</p>

  <p>Amery chuckled softly. He had to look across his shoulder at the man, for
  he was held tight to the bolt in the wall.</p>

  <p>"Come on, you!" Dame was speaking to the girl, and Amery's eyes
  glittered.</p>

  <p>"You'll look after her, Dame, because, whilst there is a chance of
  reprieve for plain murder, any aggravation of the crime, anything that turns
  the jury's mind to loathing&mdash;don't forget they have women jurors in
  murder trials&mdash;will make it hard for you&mdash;and friend Stillman."</p>

  <p>"Take her out!" cried Dame hoarsely. "Through that door." His hand was
  shaking like a man with ague.</p>

  <p>"Don't let me go, don't let me go!" she begged, half mad with terror.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" His voice was gentle and infinitely sweet. "I love you too dearly
  to have you hurt. You will remember that, won't you? The 'sinister man' loves
  you better than anything in life."</p>

  <p>He dropped his head down to the white, upturned face, and their lips met,
  and in that moment of supreme happiness she forgot their dreadful
  surroundings, forgot the danger in which they stood, was conscious only of
  the glory which wrapped her as in a sheet of living flame. In another second
  the arm of the first man was about her and had lifted her bodily to the other
  side of the shed.</p>

  <p>"You go quiet!" he hissed. "If you raise a scream I'll bash your head
  in!"</p>

  <p>Amery's eyes, baleful as a snake's, were on him, and despite his
  commanding position, the man wilted.</p>

  <p>Elsa was struggling to escape from the encircling arm. Her mouth was open
  to scream, when a big hand closed on her face.</p>

  <p>"Help me with her!" snarled the gaoler, and Dame was leaping across the
  pit, when exhausted nature took its toll and Elsa lay, an inert heap, in her
  captor's arms.</p>

  <p>"She's fainted. Thank God for that!" thought Amery, watching the girl with
  hungry eyes till the door closed on her, leaving him alone with whom he
  judged to be his executioner.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap47"
     id="chap47">XLVII. IN THE HOUSE OF DEATH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Now young fellow"&mdash;Dame was almost
  jocose&mdash;"you've got a very little time to live, and that time won't be
  so full of misery!"</p>

  <p>He made no attempt to approach his victim. In one corner of the room was a
  large barrel, which he rolled near to the hole, and, knocking off the head,
  turned it over on its side.</p>

  <p>A stream of grey dust poured forth and, upending the barrel, he emptied it
  into a big heap. At the farther end of the shed was a tap and two pails, and
  Amery watched him as he set the water running. In a little time Dame came
  back with the pails full, and, making a hole in the centre of the heap,
  poured water gently into the cavity, stirring it with a spade.</p>

  <p>"I gather that you are the Lord High Executioner?" said Amery calmly.</p>

  <p>In spite of the man's bravado he was trembling from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not," he said. "That's nothing to do with me. I'm going to put
  you where you won't be found."</p>

  <p>"A plasterer? I thought by your face you were a carpenter," said
  Amery.</p>

  <p>The man jumped.</p>

  <p>"Who told you that? I was a carpenter. I don't want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>He began plying the spade with vigour, throwing in shovelfuls of fine
  sand, and mixed until the heap was of the consistency of mortar. He paused to
  rest on the heavy shovel, and, as he did so, the blanket curtain that covered
  the door bulged, and Amery turned his head, to stare, unafraid, into the eyes
  of the man who hated him with a hatred that only death could end.</p>

  <p>Bearded, tall, with a face still covered with motor goggles, the man
  called Stillman nodded pleasantly and smiled. And so perfect was the fitting
  of the beard that even the smile did not betray his disguise.</p>

  <p>"Well, Amery, you'll be interested to learn that your Chink is at this
  moment wishing he hadn't butted into our affairs."</p>

  <p>"You surprise me," said Amery with mock politeness.</p>

  <p>"He followed your cab&mdash;you didn't know that, did you? I'll give him
  credit, he's some runner! But we caught him at the end of Ladbroke Grove, and
  he's not the only man that can use a knife."</p>

  <p>"So I understand," said Amery. "You are pretty useful that way, as poor
  old Maurice Tarn knew, if he knew anything. Queer: I thought you were driving
  the cab. What next?"</p>

  <p>The bearded man lit a cigarette before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I? Oh, I do nothing. I am the interested spectator. The big man does the
  big work." He glanced down at the pit, and from the pit to the wet cement,
  "Dame and I are the first and second gravediggers&mdash;merely that."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with the girl?"</p>

  <p>The other shook his head, blowing out a cloud of smoke.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. The big man has views about her. She knows a great deal
  more than is good for us. I suppose you realize that, Amery?"</p>

  <p>"She knows nothing. She doesn't even know who I am."</p>

  <p>The eyebrows of 'Mr. Stillman' went up.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that you haven't confided that important particular? Bless
  my soul, I thought for your safety's sake you would have told her that you
  were the Chief of the Foreign Office Intelligence Bureau for counteracting
  the drug traffic, and that they'd brought you over when poor old Bickerson
  had failed&mdash;and did this, moreover, after the thick-headed authorities
  had taken the trouble to send you to Shanghai, so that the story of your
  spoof disgrace could come to England and disarm suspicion. I admit you
  deceived me, but only for a little time. This is the finish, Amery! If I had
  my way it would be the girl's finish too! It is madness to fool around and
  leave her alive, but the big man thinks it is necessary, and I've annoyed him
  so much lately that I dare not protest."</p>

  <p>Amery was feeling gingerly at the handcuffs. Once upon a time an Indian
  prisoner had mystified him by the ease with which he had freed himself from
  these manacles. A handful of rupees had bought this secret. He was wondering
  whether he had forgotten the trick.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Stillman walked toward him, took a strap from his pocket, and,
  stooping, buckled his feet together.</p>

  <p>"It would be a thousand pities if our friend was hurt by a chance kick,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>Amery was trying hard to compress the bones of his right hand, as the
  Indian had taught him, and, with a sinking of heart, he realized the truth of
  the Indian's words: "Master, you must practise every day for this trick, or
  it can never be done."</p>

  <p>"What is it to be&mdash;a hanging or a shooting?"</p>

  <p>"Neither, I should imagine," said Stillman, and glanced at Dame. The man
  looked sick with fright.</p>

  <p>"You'd better go and look after the girl," he said. "I'll wait for the
  boss&mdash;there he is now! Come back in a quarter of an hour. I don't think
  you need wait any longer."</p>

  <p>Glad to escape, the bald-headed man staggered out of the shed, "I hear
  nothing," said Amery, his ears strained.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ho would have heard," smiled Stillman. "Here he is." Again the
  blanket bulged, a faint click as the door closed, a white, podgy hand
  appeared round the blanket, and there came into view the smiling face of Mr.
  Tupperwill, banker and purist.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap48"
     id="chap48">XLVIII. THE EXECUTIONER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. TUPPERWILL'S large, fat face was creased in an
  expression of pain and distaste. His mild eyes sought the prisoner's, held
  for a second and then wandered to the deep pit and the heap of slaked
  mortar.</p>

  <p>"Everything has been done as it should have been done," he commented. "It
  is such relief to be able to depend upon one's friends! I daresay you
  yourself have suffered from the inefficiency of subordinates in little
  matters?"</p>

  <p>Amery smiled contemptuously but did not offer to speak. The silence in
  that room, with its deadened walls and draped ceiling, was so profound that
  he could hear the ticking of his watch.</p>

  <p>"One likes to deal with dependable people, even in the trivial affairs of
  life." Mr. Tupperwill spoke earnestly. "'Trivial,' by the way, does come, as
  Trench suggests, from 'tri via,' meaning the three cross-roads where gossips
  meet."</p>

  <p>Again his eyes sought Amery's.</p>

  <p>"Theologians, great thinkers, metaphysicians, the brightest minds that
  science has known, have speculated upon what you so soon will know for
  certain, Major Amery!" he said, and sighed heavily. "Is there an after life?
  Who knows? Is it possible that the theory of a future state was born of man's
  vanity and the preposterous assumption that such perfect creatures as we
  must, as a reward for our perfection, enjoy another existence which we deny
  to the common animals?"</p>

  <p>As he was talking, he was fumbling in the pocket of his long frock-coat,
  and when his hand was withdrawn from the folds, it held a thick stick of
  irregular pattern. Amery recognized it immediately as the sjambok with which
  the banker had been struck down on the night he and his confederates had made
  their first attempt upon him, and when Tupperwill, in his anxiety, had
  incautiously come a little too close to the struggling man.</p>

  <p>"This, I think, you know? It was taken from your study a few nights ago,
  when my friends visited your house, for purposes of&mdash;ah
  &mdash;inspection. That stain"&mdash;he pointed to the end&mdash;"is blood.
  It is my blood. Observe!"</p>

  <p>He bent his head so that Amery could see the angry scar his blow had
  left.</p>

  <p>"My blood is very precious to me," he said, "and has an importance greater
  than any&mdash;as you will learn. With such a weapon as this," said Mr.
  Tupperwill in his even way, "it is possible to beat a man so that he is
  beyond recognition, to beat him until he dies. I daresay that, considering in
  your mind the mode of death that I had planned for you, various methods, such
  as shooting, killing, hanging, perhaps, or something equally painless, must
  have occurred to you? Even my friends in all probability pictured some such
  system."</p>

  <p>He looked across to Stillman for confirmation. Stillman's attitude was
  curious. He seemed entirely under the spell of the stout man's eloquence, and
  had neither eyes nor mind for the prisoner. He was gazing intently upon the
  banker, hanging on to every word he spoke, his lips moving as though he were
  repeating, syllable by syllable, all that "the big man" said.</p>

  <p>Tupperwill examined the chains and the bolts, tested them by exerting all
  his strength, felt the handcuffs, the strap about the prisoner's feet, and,
  as if satisfied with his scrutiny, he stepped across the pit, and, laying
  down the stick, first placed a handkerchief on the floor, then, taking off
  his coat, folded and placed this as carefully on the handkerchief. On the top
  of the coat he laid his shining silk hat, unfastened the heavy gold links
  about his shirt cuffs and rolled them back until his big arms were
  revealed.</p>

  <p>"You have the smock?" he asked pleasantly.</p>

  <p>From where Amery stood he could not see the black coat that hung against
  the end wall.</p>

  <p>"Such as butchers use," said Mr. Tupperwill, as he was helped into the
  long black garment that buttoned from chin to foot. He lifted the lantern and
  brought it nearer to the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"I wish to see what I am doing," he said with a smile, and wetted the palm
  of his hand. "You are going?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'll go," said Stillman huskily.</p>

  <p>The spell was broken: he could not stay and see what was to follow.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is as well," said Tupperwill with great politeness. "Happily,
  I am entirely without nerves. When in ten minutes you return, I shall have
  gone, and Mr. Dame and you will have little to do. Now, Major Amery, are you
  ready?"</p>

  <p>The thud of the first blow came to Stillman's ears as he hurriedly closed
  the door... He found Dame sitting in the kitchen before a half-emptied bottle
  of whisky. The man was looking ghastly, was almost in tears, and, when
  Stillman came in:</p>

  <p>"Well," he stammered, "is it over? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You heard what
  he said about being wakened up in the morning? Did you ever see an execution,
  Stillman? Is it bad?"</p>

  <p>"Shut up, you fool!" growled the bearded man.</p>

  <p>He looked back at the door through which he had come.</p>

  <p>"I've a mind to stop it!" he said between his teeth, and Dame laughed
  hysterically.</p>

  <p>"You dare not! He'd shoot you like a dog. You know him better than I do.
  Besides, we're both in it. What does it matter? One more or less...</p>

  <p>"He might have used the knife," growled the man. "It is butchery. 'Where's
  the girl?"</p>

  <p>"In there." Mr. Dame nodded to a door leading from the kitchen. "That's
  the pantry&mdash;I've got a bed there. What are we to do with her?"</p>

  <p>"Keep her."</p>

  <p>"Here!" shrieked the horrified Dame. "She can't stay here! My daughter
  would find her."</p>

  <p>"Then send your daughter away. You've any number of rooms. Dope her with
  that."</p>

  <p>He banged a little bottle down on the table, and the other examined it
  stupidly.</p>

  <p>"Did he get that?"</p>

  <p>Stillman nodded.</p>

  <p>"He thinks of everything," breathed Dame.</p>

  <p>"Give her a few drops in her tea," said Stillman, "and she will give you
  no trouble. The rooms at the top of the house are furnished?"</p>

  <p>Dame nodded.</p>

  <p>"Put her there. What time do you expect that girl of yours home?"</p>

  <p>"Not before two."</p>

  <p>The bald man looked up at the noisy American clock that was ticking above
  the mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"It's only twelve now. My God! Only twelve, and it seems years! What is he
  going to do with her?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," impatiently. "He'll fix her to-morrow. She'll not give you
  any trouble, I tell you. She's quiet enough now."</p>

  <p>He opened the door and peered in. There was no lamp in the pantry, but by
  such light as the kitchen supplied, he saw a truckle bed in one corner and a
  figure that lay motionless. Closing the door noiselessly, he came back to the
  brooding Dame. Their eyes went to the clock together.</p>

  <p>"Ten minutes," said Dame. "You're going to help me?"</p>

  <p>Stillman looked round sharply.</p>

  <p>"That is not my business, Dame... don't be a fool. There isn't ten
  minutes' work in it."</p>

  <p>The other licked his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"Suppose they trace him? This would be the first place they'd search.
  They'd see the floor was newly cemented."</p>

  <p>"Who is going to trace him&mdash;the Chink? You can ease your mind; the
  Chink's dead. I settled him myself. Look!"</p>

  <p>The white cuff under the sleeve was dabbled red. Dame drew along, sobbing
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God, I wish I was out of it!"</p>

  <p>"Don't let him hear you," warned the other, "or you'll be out of it in a
  way that you least expect!"</p>

  <p>The clock tick-tick-ticked, the hands did not seem to move. They sat
  dumbly, waiting for the minutes to pass. Ten eternal minutes went at
  last.</p>

  <p>"Come now, do your job," said Stillman.</p>

  <p>The man did not move. Fifteen minutes, and then Stillman's hand fell on
  his shoulder, and he jumped up with a scream. Like a blind man, he staggered
  down the garden and stood for fully five minutes at the door of the garage,
  his heart thumping so that it seemed to choke him. At last, gritting his
  teeth, he pulled open the door. The candle had burnt down to the socket; it
  spluttered, died, flared up, spluttered again and then went out, but in that
  brief moment of light he saw the empty handcuffs, and out of the corner of
  his eye, a figure at the bottom of the pit.</p>

  <p>The perspiration streamed down his face; he was sobbing hysterically as,
  working like a madman, he shovelled the viscid mortar into the pit, covered
  it with earth until at last it was level.</p>

  <p>The rest must wait; he could not stay any longer in the dark, and,
  flinging open the door, he rushed up the garden, as though the gibing spirit
  of Paul Amery were at his elbow.</p>

  <p>Stillman jumped up as the white-faced man fell in, and, catching him as
  his knees gave way, he dropped him into a chair and poured out a glassful of
  neat whisky.</p>

  <p>"Drink this, you fool," he said. He was almost as white himself as he
  looked round toward the pantry door.</p>

  <p>"I've fixed a padlock&mdash;here is the key. Look after her, do you
  hear?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded stupidly.</p>

  <p>"You understand? She is to be taken upstairs and kept there: she must not
  be allowed to attract attention in any circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going? Don't leave me alone," whined Dame, his teeth
  chattering, as Stillman made a move to go.</p>

  <p>"I'm off to find Tup and tell him that you've settled things. And I want
  to know what is going to happen to this girl. She's important, I tell
  you."</p>

  <p>Another second, and Dame was alone&mdash;alone with his ghosts, his fears,
  the strange sounds of the night that nearly drove him mad, the sough of wind
  in the chimney, the patter of rain on the windows, and above and through all,
  the consciousness of the dark secret that he must go out with the first light
  of dawn to hide finally.</p>

  <p>He raised the glass to his lips and did not put it down until half its
  contents were drunk. Then, with a start, he remembered Amery's words, and,
  dropping his head into his arms, he sobbed like a frightened child.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap49"
     id="chap49">XLIX. THE ESCAPE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ELSA MARLOWE knew she had fainted, knew this while she was
  unconscious, knew that something dreadful... horrible had happened, and
  groaned as she turned on the hard bed. Her elbow came into contact with the
  wall, and the pain of the blow did much to bring her to complete
  consciousness. Her head was throbbing, she felt a queer fluttering in her
  throat, and when she tried to stand up, her knees gave way under her and she
  fell back on the bed.</p>

  <p>And then, in a flood of terror, she remembered. Paul Amery was a prisoner,
  and they were going to kill him... and he loved her!</p>

  <p>She struggled toward where four tiny circles gleamed in the darkness. They
  were holes cut into the pantry door, and through them she looked out upon a
  kitchen which at first she did not recognize. A man sprawled across the
  table, his head on his arms, an empty glass and a nearly empty bottle by his
  side. Mr. Dame! Jessie's father.</p>

  <p>She tried the door: it was fastened. Yet, there was hope, for the man was
  fast asleep, and if she could only find a way of opening the door, escape was
  assured. She heard his deep snores, and pressed with all her might, but
  though the door gave slightly, her most strenuous efforts failed to wrench
  loose the fastening. She was weak, but even if she had been stronger, it
  might have been a task beyond her strength to break the stout hasp. There was
  nothing to do but to wait... and, waiting, torture her mind with thoughts of
  what would happen to the man in whose eyes she had seen such love and
  tenderness as she did not dream was in all the world.</p>

  <p>The thought drove her frantic. Again she threw herself at the door, only
  to be hurled back bruised and hurt. And then she heard footsteps in the hall,
  and her heart stood still. There came the sound of feet on the stairs, and
  then silence... after a while she heard the intruder descend the hall again,
  and a voice called: "Father!"</p>

  <p>It was Jessie Dame!</p>

  <p>Was it possible that she was in league with these terrible men?</p>

  <p>"Father, are you downstairs?"</p>

  <p>The girl had evidently seen a light, for now Elsa could hear her coming
  down the passage toward the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"Father, what is the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Jessie, for God's sake!"</p>

  <p>At the sound of the terrified whisper, Jessie Dame spun round, ludicrous
  in her fear.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"It is I&mdash;Elsa Marlowe."</p>

  <p>"Where are you? Oh, how you frightened me!" whimpered the girl.</p>

  <p>"Don't make a noise. I'm in here."</p>

  <p>"In the pantry?" said Jessie, gaping.</p>

  <p>"Let me out, please."</p>

  <p>Jessie Dame came slowly over, with a backward glance at the slumbering
  man.</p>

  <p>"The padlock is fastened... he'll have the key in his pocket. Did he put
  you here? Oh, my God, he'll get into trouble! I knew he'd get into
  trouble!"</p>

  <p>She tried to pull the lock loose.</p>

  <p>"I'll go and find my key," she whispered, and went out.</p>

  <p>She seemed to have been away for an hour, though it could not have been
  many minutes before she returned, and, creeping on tiptoe to the door, tried
  key after key, until at last the rusty lock turned and the girl came out into
  the kitchen, free.</p>

  <p>At that moment Mr. Dame growled in his sleep and moved.</p>

  <p>"Quick, quick!" hissed the frightened girl, pushing her companion into the
  passage. "He'll kill me if he finds I've done this!"</p>

  <p>Even as they were mounting the stairs to the hall, the man awoke. One
  glance he gave at the open door, and then, with a yell that froze his
  daughter's blood, he came blundering out into the passage and up the stairs.
  Jessie was fumbling at the lock, her palsied fingers refusing to function,
  and Elsa thrust her aside. Just as Dame's head came level with the hall, the
  door was opened and they fled out, slamming it behind them.</p>

  <p>The street was in darkness. There was not a soul in sight, as they fled
  toward the main road, Dame, staggering in pursuit, roaring and screaming in a
  frenzy that was half drunkenness, and half genuine fear of what would follow
  the girl's escape.</p>

  <p>Glancing back as she ran, Elsa saw that she was alone. Jessie Dame, who
  knew the neighbourhood, had dived into a side turning, unnoticed by her
  father. The man had shaken off his stupor and was gaining.</p>

  <p>And then, as the girl felt that she could not go another step farther, she
  saw a blessed sight. Crossing the road, visible in the street lamp, a line of
  helmeted heads, and to her ears came the thud-thud-thud of tramping feet. The
  night patrols were returning from duty.</p>

  <p>Into their very midst she ran, and a stout policeman caught her as she
  fell into his arms. The night and its horrors faded in a swoon from which she
  was not to recover till the morning sunlight fell across the hospital bed in
  which she lay.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap50"
     id="chap50">L</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE MORNING AFTER</p>

  <p>AT eleven o'clock the next morning, Inspector Bickerson walked into the
  office of his Superintendent and dropped wearily into a chair. Wille looked
  up from under his shaggy brows and demanded:</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Well enough for you, Super," said Bickerson bitterly, "but for me it's
  hell! What with a lunatic girl's statements and frantic cock-and-bull stories
  about Soyoka, I haven't stood in one place from five o'clock this morning!
  According to the telephone message you sent me, the girl stated specifically
  that Amery was a prisoner, if he wasn't dead, at Dame's house. She's either
  mad or dreaming," said Bickerson decisively. "I was at Dame's house before
  eight o'clock. He'd evidently had a real good souse, for he was still far
  from sober. I went to the garage, and I certainly was suspicious when I saw
  that there had been a hole in the centre of the garage and that it had been
  filled in. That looked almost as if Miss Marlowe's story was true. But I had
  it opened, every scrap of earth and cement taken up&mdash;fortunately, the
  cement hadn't had time to set&mdash;and not only was there no sign of a body,
  but there never had been a body!"</p>

  <p>"Marks of blood?"</p>

  <p>"None. The floor had recently been washed down, but Dame explained that by
  telling me that he'd had a clean-out the night before. He explained the hole
  by telling me that he had been trying to dig a pit for his car, but finding
  himself encroaching on gas lines and drain lines, he wisely gave it up. My
  labourers found pipe lines six feet below the surface of the garage."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent consulted a memorandum.</p>

  <p>"There were no blankets hanging on the walls to deaden sound?"</p>

  <p>"No, but there had been. I found a heap of blankets in a corner of the
  garage."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent leant back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it queer Amery hasn't turned up?"</p>

  <p>Bickerson shrugged his broad shoulders. "I have stopped trying to keep a
  tag on Amery."</p>

  <p>"And this other story"&mdash;Wille turned over a pile of papers and found
  a document&mdash;"this suggestion that the head of the Soyoka gang is
  Tupperwill? Have you seen him?"</p>

  <p>"I've just come from him," said Bickerson. "His worst offence, from my
  point of view, is that he is a very loquacious and long-winded gentleman,
  whose mind is completely taken up with the question of licensing hours and
  the need for introducing prohibition into working-class districts. I asked
  him point-blank what communication he had had with the Soyoka people, or if
  he knew anybody or had any clients on his books who might be Soyoka's agents,
  and he gave me the impression that I was a harmless lunatic that needed
  humouring. He said he'd never heard of Soyoka, and I couldn't even get him to
  understand that he might be under suspicion of being Soyoka himself. I had
  the good luck to catch him just outside the bank: he had been spending the
  night at Brighton, he told me, and hadn't been home. When I told him I was a
  police officer, his chief concern seemed to be whether there had been a
  burglary at his house."</p>

  <p>Superintendent Wille's frown was intensified.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand it," he said. "There must be something in the story.
  Here we have Amery's Chinese manager picked up, half dead, undoubtedly
  knifed, and that within a few hundred yards of Dame's house&mdash;by the way,
  how is the Chinaman?"</p>

  <p>"The doctor says he's out of danger," said Bickerson, "and will be well in
  a few weeks. The fellow who stabbed him seems to have just missed touching a
  vital spot. I admit that is queer, and I wanted to interrogate Feng Ho, but
  the doctors will not allow him to be questioned for another day. I'm going
  round to see the girl Dame. Apparently she went to the office very
  early&mdash;maybe I'll find friend Amery&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who you still think is Soyoka?" asked Wille.</p>

  <p>Bickerson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he admitted ruefully, "that was an error into which the cleverest
  man might fall, and I don't profess to be clever."</p>

  <p>Bickerson walked eastward, a preoccupied and, as Superintendent Wille
  hoped, a chastened man. He found Jessie Dame in her tiny office, and it was
  not necessary that he should have made a close study of her to see that a
  remarkable change had come over her. Jessie Dame never had a good colour, but
  now her complexion was a pale green, and her hollow eyes told of a sleepless
  night.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, Miss Dame," said Bickerson. "What time did you get home
  last night?" And then by way of explanation: "You know me&mdash;I'm Mr.
  Bickerson."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I know you," she said quietly, avoiding his keen eyes. "I've
  seen you here before. I got home at twelve o'clock. I ought really to have
  stayed out until two, but I was so worried&mdash;I mean," she said, in some
  confusion, "I intended staying out later, but owing to business troubles I
  came home early."</p>

  <p>"That almost sounds as though it weren't true," smiled Bickerson. "What
  were your business troubles?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the office, and&mdash;the way Major Amery goes on and all that sort
  of thing," said Jessie Dame desperately. "I can't explain."</p>

  <p>"You left home early this morning? I was at your home before eight, but I
  did not see you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I came away very early."</p>

  <p>In truth, Jessie Dame had walked the streets all night, and if she was
  lying now, it was in obedience to the urgent note that she had found waiting
  for her on her arrival at the office, giving her exact instructions as to
  what she was to say, and ending with a horrific threat that chilled her blood
  to read.</p>

  <p>"You didn't by chance find Miss Marlowe in your house, locked up in a
  cupboard?"</p>

  <p>For a fraction of a second she struggled to find her voice. "No, sir," she
  gulped at last, "and if Miss Marlowe says that I did, she is not telling the
  truth. I don't know what happened last night," said the girl. "I really don't
  know! I had one glass of wine and it sort of went to my head."</p>

  <p>"You heard nothing about Major Amery being&mdash;locked up in your
  garage?"</p>

  <p>The green turned to a sickly white. Jessie staggered back against the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Major Amery?" she said hollowly. "Locked up in our garage? What do you
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"I see&mdash;you know nothing about that. Didn't Miss Marlowe tell
  you?"</p>

  <p>She was almost eager in her reply. It was such a relief to tell the
  truth.</p>

  <p>"Major Amery isn't here this morning?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, not trusting her voice.</p>

  <p>He strolled from her room into the little office usually occupied by Elsa,
  tried the door of Amery's room and, finding it locked, walked back to Jessie
  Dame.</p>

  <p>"Where is Miss&mdash;Miss Marlowe?" she asked jerkily.</p>

  <p>"When I saw her last she was at the West London Hospital."</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;she's not hurt?"</p>

  <p>"No, she's not hurt. The doctor thought she could go out to-day but I
  doubt if she will."</p>

  <p>He had hardly spoken the words before a light step sounded in the passage
  outside, and he had a fleeting glimpse of a dainty figure as it passed the
  open doorway.</p>

  <p>"That's her!" gasped Miss Dame.</p>

  <p>"Miss Marlowe? Impossible!"</p>

  <p>He went out and looked after her. Jessie Dame was right. Elsa was hanging
  up her hat and coat as he walked in to her, marvelling at the extraordinary
  reserves which women possess, that could enable her to appear after such a
  night as she had spent, bearing such little evidence of her ordeal. Save for
  the shadows beneath her eyes and the faintness of the pink in her cheeks, she
  seemed in no way changed.</p>

  <p>She greeted him with a grave inclination of her head, took off the
  typewriter cover with the assurance of one who expects to be called at any
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Why did they let you out?" he demanded. "When I saw you this morning you
  seemed more dead than alive."</p>

  <p>"I came out because I wanted to come," she said.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't seem a very good reason. I suppose you know I've
  investigated your story?"</p>

  <p>"I know; you've already told me."</p>

  <p>"I've told you there was no body in the garage, and certainly no sign of
  murder. Otherwise the particulars you supplied correspond with the position
  of the building, and certainly there has been a hole in the floor."</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>"But, as I tell you, there was nothing in the pit but earth and drying
  cement. I think you must have dreamt this. Hadn't you visited Mr. Dame's
  house the day before?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Did you see anything there that suggested a pit to you?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him frowning.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;" she began. "Why, yes, I saw a man come out of the garage with a
  spade in his hand."</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" he said triumphantly. "I don't know the name of the nervous
  disease from which you're suffering, but perhaps Dr. Hallam will tell
  you."</p>

  <p>"I didn't imagine all I saw last night," she said in a low voice. "You
  were talking to Jessie Dame; she can confirm my story."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," said Bickerson, "that is just what she wouldn't do!
  Miss Dame says she did not find you in a cupboard or release you, or do any
  of the things which you say she did."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap51"
     id="chap51">LI. THE BANK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR a moment Elsa stared at him incredulously, and then her
  face changed.</p>

  <p>"Of course, poor girl. She's afraid of her father."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bickerson threw out his hands in a hopeless gesture.</p>

  <p>"I'd sooner have any kind of case than this," he said in despair. "A
  witness with illusions is a nightmare! I don't want to hurt your feelings,
  but I can't believe you. Major Amery hasn't come?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think he's come," she said, ignoring the doubt he was
  throwing on her sanity. She tried the door. "Why, it's locked!"</p>

  <p>"Was it locked last night?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I left before him," she said slowly. Stooping, she looked
  through the keyhole.</p>

  <p>"The key is not there. I think I can open it with the key of my door," she
  said, and this she did.</p>

  <p>The office was exactly as Amery had left it. The cleaners had not been
  able to get in. A few cigarette ends lay in the grate and a half-burnt
  cigar.</p>

  <p>She offered no further information, and after a glance round Bickerson
  walked out of the room and she followed.</p>

  <p>"He is a mysterious fellow," said the detective, "but not quite as&mdash;"
  he was at a loss for a word.</p>

  <p>"'Sinister' is the expression you want," suggested the girl with a faint
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is," he said in surprise. "No, he's not as sinister as I thought
  he was. In fact&mdash;" he seemed on the point of telling her something, but
  changed his mind. "What is that book?" He pointed to a worn leather book that
  lay on her table.</p>

  <p>"The night watchman's report," she said. "He brings it up every morning
  for Major Amery to see the names of people who may have called, or telephone
  calls and telegrams that have arrived after office hours."</p>

  <p>She opened the book where the blotting paper marked the place, and checked
  an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tupperwill came at ten minutes to six!"</p>

  <p>For a moment she was so interested that she forgot her audience.</p>

  <p>"Tupperwill came here?" he said incredulously, and looked over her
  shoulder. "That is very queer." He spoke half to himself. "I was with Mr.
  Tupperwill this morning, and he told me that he went home from his bank at
  five o'clock and never stirred out, until he decided, for no reason at all,
  to spend the night at Brighton, and went down by the nine o'clock train."</p>

  <p>Later, after he had made a further round of calls, he reported by
  telephone to his chief.</p>

  <p>"This case grows queerer and queerer," he said. "I've just been talking to
  Mrs. Ralph Hallam, who tells me that she was half killed last night by
  somebody who broke into the house. Who it was she doesn't know, but the first
  person she saw, when she recovered consciousness, was Major Amery, and
  apparently he went out of the house with the girl&mdash;Miss Marlowe, I'm
  talking about."</p>

  <p>"That gives her story support," said the Superintendent after a pause.
  "Was he alone?"</p>

  <p>"No, his Chinese manager, Feng Ho, was with him, and apparently Dr. Hallam
  came soon after."</p>

  <p>"Is she related to Dr. Hallam?"</p>

  <p>"His wife," said Bickerson, "but she says he didn't leave the flat until
  long after Amery went. I've been round to see him, but he's not at home."</p>

  <p>Another long pause.</p>

  <p>"This case grows queer. Keep in touch with the office, Bickerson."</p>

  <p>"I'll do something more than that," said the detective. "I'll watch that
  girl. There is something about the business that I do not like."</p>

  <p>Whether she were watched or unwatched, Elsa Marlowe was indifferent, The
  hours passed with leaden feet; at every sound she started up; not once, but
  fifty times, did she open the door of Amery's room and peep in,
  hoping&mdash;praying, indeed&mdash;that he would come in in his own, furtive
  way, and every time she looked she saw nothing but his chair and the
  blotting-pad, and the bell above her head was silent.</p>

  <p>He must have escaped&mdash;he must!</p>

  <p>Weary as she was, and reluctant to leave the office for fear he should
  come in, she made a journey back to the hospital to enquire the condition of
  Feng Ho, and was relieved to learn that he was so far out of danger that she
  might see him. She was most anxious to learn all she could about his master,
  for she guessed that this little man would know far more about him, if he
  were free, than the best detective in the world.</p>

  <p>He looked up at her as she came into the private ward which he occupied
  alone, and greeted her with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Perforations of thorax notwithstanding," he said faintly, "scientific
  bachelor will escape mortality on this occasion." She read the question in
  his eyes and shook her head. "I don't know, When did you see the Major
  last?"</p>

  <p>"Last night, young miss," he said gravely. "Has he not resumed appearance
  in commercial centres, viz., City of London?"</p>

  <p>"No, Feng Ho," she answered quietly.</p>

  <p>"Then Tupperwill knows."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tupperwill?" She thought he was wandering in his mind.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tupperwill is an extremely dangerous character, being connected with
  Nipponese Soyoka, purveyor of noxious and intoxicating drugs."</p>

  <p>"But surely you're mistaken? Not Mr. Tupperwill?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, young miss. The honourable Major has distinct information. All
  errors are eliminated."</p>

  <p>She could only gaze at him in stupefied wonder. That pleasant bore,
  engaged in a criminal conspiracy? It was impossible.</p>

  <p>"Did you tell Mr. Bickerson?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Young miss, eminent detective policeman has not yet interrogated owing to
  reluctance of medical officials to risk elevation of temperature. Young
  miss"&mdash;his voice was a whisper&mdash;"you must exercise great care owing
  to absence of Major. I desire to call at Major's house and instruct Chang to
  hasten to me. Give explicit directions, remembering he is a poor, ignorant
  Chinaman, of dubious parentage and deplorable education."</p>

  <p>He seemed so exhausted by this effort that she made no further attempt to
  question him, and, after exchanging a few words with the matron, she took a
  taxi to Brook Street.</p>

  <p>The Major's housekeeper had not had word of him, nor had his butler.</p>

  <p>"Can I see the Chinese servant?"</p>

  <p>"Yes miss," said the housekeeper, "though he doesn't speak much
  English."</p>

  <p>Whether he spoke English or not, the diminutive Chang under stood all that
  she had told him, and took the address and the little map she had drawn,
  directing him to the hospital, shaking his head to indicate his
  understanding.</p>

  <p>There was no fresh news at the office when she returned. Greatly daring,
  she had requested one of the sub-managers to take Feng Ho's place, and had
  deputed another to deal with the correspondence that ordinarily would have
  been seen by Amery, and she was now free to continue her investigations along
  the lines suggested by Feng Ho's monstrous and extraordinary charge.</p>

  <p>She was sufficiently well acquainted with Mr. Tupperwill's habits to know
  that he would be at the bank until three o'clock, and she remained in the
  office just long enough to attend to an enquiry that had come through, and
  which the sub-manager could not deal with, and then she boarded a 'bus and
  went eastward.</p>

  <p>It took her some time to locate the court in which Stebbing's Bank was
  situated; then: "Stebbing's?" said a policeman, looking at her queerly. "Yes,
  it is round the first court to the left. You a depositor, miss?" he asked
  with the fatherly familiarity of the City policeman.</p>

  <p>"No," she smiled, "I haven't that fortune."</p>

  <p>"You're lucky," he said cryptically.</p>

  <p>She thought it was a piece of pleasantry, but she turned into the court
  and saw a small crowd standing before a closed doorway, on which had been
  pinned a notice. She looked up at the fascia&mdash;yes, it was the
  old-fashioned Stebbing's. But why was the door closed at midday?</p>

  <p>Pushing her way through the crowd, she read;</p><br>

  <p class="sign">Stebbing's Bank.</p>

  <p class="sign">The Bank has temporarily suspended payment.<br>
  Enquiries should be addressed to<br>
  Slake &amp; Stern, Solicitors, Bolt Street, E.C.</p><br>

  <p>She drew clear of the crowd, bewildered, stupefied by the news. Poor Mr.
  Tupperwill! For the moment she forgot Feng Ho's wild charge, and remembered
  only the kindliness, the gentle inadequacy of the placid banker. And then she
  heard somebody speaking.</p>

  <p>"... a man named Tupperwill... they said he laid his hands on all the
  money he could find and went to the Continent this morning by aeroplane."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap52"
     id="chap52">LII. RALPH HALLAM'S COAT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE failure of Stebbing's Bank was notified to the duty
  officer at Scotland Yard within five minutes of the notice being posted, and
  Superintendent Wille despatched an orderly in search of Bickerson. That
  officer was taking an afternoon doze in his room, the blinds drawn, when the
  constable came for him, and he hurried to the bureau of his chief.</p>

  <p>"Look at this," growled Wille, pushing his paper across the table.</p>

  <p>Bickerson read and whistled.</p>

  <p>"The City police closed the bank, from information evidently supplied by
  Major Amery overnight. There is a warrant out for Tupperwill and for the
  auditors, but Tupperwill seems to have skipped. What time did you see
  him?"</p>

  <p>"At a little before eleven."</p>

  <p>"Was he going into the bank? This report says that he hasn't been in the
  City to-day."</p>

  <p>"I didn't actually see him go into the bank. I left him at the entrance of
  Tredgers Court, not doubting that he was on his way to his office."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice anything unusual about him? Did he look worried or upset
  in any way?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Bickerson thoughtfully. "I thought it queer that he should
  have gone to Brighton on the previous night&mdash;that struck me as strange
  for a man of his settled habits. But there was nothing at all remarkable in
  his appearance or his manner."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent read the paper again. It contained a very full
  description of the wanted man. Then he rang the bell for his clerk.
  "Circulate this description to all ports and railway stations, for detention
  and report. Get Croydon and find if he has left by aeroplane&mdash;that is
  the City police theory. Notify C. Divisional Office that his house is to be
  occupied until further orders. That will do."</p>

  <p>"We must wait now," said Wille when they were alone, "until we get the
  report on which the City police acted. But in the meantime you'd better round
  up Tupperwill's friends. Do you know of any?"</p>

  <p>Bickerson considered.</p>

  <p>"I've an idea that Hallam was one. If he wasn't a friend, they were
  certainly on dining terms, and Hallam was a depositor at the bank."</p>

  <p>"The doctor?"</p>

  <p>Bickerson nodded.</p>

  <p>"The man you are getting a warrant for?"</p>

  <p>"If Jarvie squeals I shall certainly get a warrant for him, but at present
  there is no information to go upon."</p>

  <p>Superintendent Wille chewed a meditative toothpick. "Go along and see
  Hallam. You may learn something about Tupperwill's other friends, and more
  especially about Stillman, I've heard only the faintest rumour about this
  gentleman, but he was evidently a client. From the 'phone talk I've had with
  the Chief of the City police, it seems that Stillman is one of the persons
  who are wanted in connection with the bank failure. He was evidently a man
  closely in the confidence of Tupperwill, and I've got a hunch that friend
  Hallam may be able to put you on to this person. Report here as soon as
  you're through. I'm having a consultation with the Commissioner this
  afternoon about Miss Marlowe's story."</p>

  <p>"Do you think Stillman is Hallam?" asked Bickerson bluntly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I have no very definite theory. At any rate, I shall have a
  clearer idea after you have seen the doctor."</p>

  <p>Ralph's servant admitted the detective. His master was upstairs, dressing,
  he said.</p>

  <p>"A late bird, eh?" asked Bickerson, in the friendly tone that had been the
  undoing of so many innocent and talkative servants.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, he was rather late; he was out at a dance last night."</p>

  <p>"Tell him I'm here."</p>

  <p>He had been shown into the study at the back of the house, a small and
  comfortably fitted room. The windows were open, for it was a mild day, and
  the window-box, crowded with golden daffodils, caught the early afternoon
  sunlight.</p>

  <p>Bickerson strolled to one of the bookshelves and scanned the titles
  aimlessly. Then his inquisitive eyes roamed systematically around the
  apartment. Evidently Ralph had partly changed in the room when he had
  returned in the early hours of the morning, for his great-coat was thrown
  over the back of a chair, and one buttoned dress boot was under the table,
  the other being beneath the chair and hidden by the hanging coat. Without
  hesitation, Bickerson picked up the coat, slipped his hand into one of the
  pockets, found it empty, and tried the other. And then something attracted
  his attention and he carried the coat to the light. One of the sleeves was
  caked hard with some liquid which had been spilt upon it. He turned back the
  cuff, and the lighter lining showed a rusty red stain.</p>

  <p>Blood! He tried the other sleeve. Here the stain was larger, and extended
  from the cuff halfway up the inner part of the arm. He picked up one of the
  boots and whistled softly. It was spattered with stains, and when he scraped
  them his fingers were covered with dark red dust.</p>

  <p>He heard Ralph descending the stairs, put down the boots and waited.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, Bickerson." Hallam's voice was expressionless, his face a
  mask. Instantly his eyes had fallen upon the coat and the boots, and he was
  waiting.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, doctor. I've called to make a few enquiries about
  Tupperwill. You know the bank has bust?"</p>

  <p>Hallam expressed no surprise.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know. When did this happen?"</p>

  <p>"This morning. Tupperwill has left hurriedly. You knew him very well?"</p>

  <p>"Fairly well," said Hallam.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea where he is likely to be?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest," said the other calmly. "I know Tupperwill only in his
  home. If he is not there, I haven't the slightest idea where he is to be
  found."</p>

  <p>"You don't know where Major Amery happens to be?"</p>

  <p>The ghost of a smile hovered at the corners of Hallam's set lips. "He also
  is an individual who seldom took me into his confidence. Has he
  disappeared?"</p>

  <p>"He has very much disappeared," said Bickerson, and, stooping slowly,
  picked up the coat. "Had an accident last night, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"You mean the blood on the sleeves?" said Hallam coolly. "There's some on
  the cuff too."</p>

  <p>"Did you cut your finger or something?" asked the detective
  sardonically.</p>

  <p>Hallam laughed.</p>

  <p>"How absurd! A cut finger wouldn't make that stain."</p>

  <p>"What would?" asked Bickerson sternly.</p>

  <p>"Well,"&mdash;Ralph chose his words carefully&mdash;"picking up a wounded
  Chinaman, who had been knifed by some persons or persons unknown, might make
  a mess of a man's sleeve."</p>

  <p>Bickerson was staggered.</p>

  <p>"Was it you who found Feng Ho?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Hallam nodded. "I was one of those who assisted him to the hospital."</p>

  <p>Their eyes met. "The police of the Hammersmith Division made no reference
  to your being present when Feng Ho was found."</p>

  <p>"They must have overlooked me," said the other lightly. "And really, I
  feel so insignificant in the presence of police officers that I don't wonder!
  The truth is, Bickerson, I was looking for Amery&mdash;Feng Ho and I. He went
  away suddenly from Herbert Mansions, as his servant believed, kidnapped with
  Miss Marlowe, who, I am happy to learn, is safe."</p>

  <p>"Who told you that?" asked the detective sharply.</p>

  <p>"I telephoned this morning because I saw something in the evening paper
  about a young lady who was found wandering in Kensington."</p>

  <p>"You tell that story too, do you, about them being taken away? It is an
  extraordinary case. Presumably you will be able to account for every minute
  of your movements last night?"</p>

  <p>"Almost every minute," said the other.</p>

  <p>"What time did you return home this morning?" asked Bickerson.</p>

  <p>Ralph hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Whatever time my servant said I came is about accurate," he said.
  "Somewhere in the region of four&mdash;it may have been a little later. As
  for Tupperwill, if that is really the object of your coming, I am absolutely
  unable to give you any information. I know nothing about him except that I
  have an overdraft at his bank and that I've dined with him once or twice. Of
  his habits and his inner life I know less than you."</p>

  <p>He expected Bickerson to return to the question of the bloodstained coat,
  but, to his relief, the detective made no further reference and left shortly
  after. He did not report immediately to Wille, but, going to his own room,
  got through on the telephone to the Kensington police.</p>

  <p>"Who found the Chinaman?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Constable Simmons. He was on patrol duty and heard a groan in a garden.
  Going in, he found the man and had him taken to the hospital on a lorry that
  happened to be passing."</p>

  <p>"No other person assisted?" asked the interested Bickerson. "Nobody named
  Hallam?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, there was no question about the facts," said the voice of the
  sergeant on duty. "Simmons and the driver of the trolley were the only people
  concerned."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Bickerson, and put the telephone back.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Hallam," he said softly, "you are a liar. And if you're not something
  else, I'm very much mistaken!"</p>

  <h2><a name="chap53"
     id="chap53">LIII. DAME PASSES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">His interview with Wille was short enough. Wille and the
  Commissioner had discussed Elsa's story, and had decided that further
  investigation was necessary.</p>

  <p>"See Dame and arrest him. You'd better report to the local division: they
  will send a man with you," were his instructions.</p>

  <p>Jessie Dame went home very early that afternoon, in response to the
  instructions she had had from her father that morning. She was sick with
  fright as she slowly mounted the steps of that fateful house and rang the
  bell. Dame opened the door himself, and at first she did not recognize him.
  His yellow moustache had vanished, and she stared into the face of a
  stranger.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he growled. "You...! You've got me into a mess, you and that...
  And you've got to get me out!"</p>

  <p>"Is anything wrong, father?" she asked, trembling.</p>

  <p>"Wrong!" he roared. "Wrong!"</p>

  <p>There was no need to ask. His face betrayed the seriousness of the crisis.
  He almost dragged her into the dining-room. On the table she saw his grip,
  packed and strapped.</p>

  <p>"I'm leaving London at once," he said.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"I'm likely to tell you that, ain't I?" he almost howled at her. "Here is
  some money." He threw a handful of notes on the table. "Go on to a
  boarding-house and keep quiet. When I'm ready for you I'll send for you, and
  you'll come&mdash;you understand? You'll tell nobody where I am, if I ever do
  send for you."</p>

  <p>"But, father, what is wrong? Is it serious? Is it about Miss Marlowe?" she
  whimpered.</p>

  <p>"Never mind what it's about: that is nothing to do with you. I'm going at
  once. If anybody comes, you're to say that you expect me back to-night. And
  if you tell them that I've taken my moustache off, I'll murder you! You can
  sell the furniture and keep the money, in case I want it. And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There came a sharp rat-tat at the door, and he ran to the window, pulled
  aside the blinds and staggered back.</p>

  <p>"Two 'busies'," "he said huskily, "Bickerson and another man. By God! they
  wouldn't pinch me!"</p>

  <p>Again came the knock.</p>

  <p>"I'll go down to the kitchen. Tell them I'm out," he said, and tiptoed
  down the stairs.</p>

  <p>With a fainting heart the girl opened the door and stammered the
  message.</p>

  <p>"He's out, is he?" said Bickerson good-humouredly. "Come, come, Miss Dame,
  you oughtn't to tell those kind of stories. I want to see him for a few
  minutes."</p>

  <p>"He's gone out, really, Mr. Bickerson," said the girl, half fainting with
  fear.</p>

  <p>Bickerson pushed his way past her, walked into the dining-room, saw the
  grip on the table and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Just wait here"&mdash;he was speaking to the other man&mdash;"I think I
  can find my way to the kitchen. You watch the stairs."</p>

  <p>She stood, petrified with terror, heard the kitchen door open...</p>

  <p>Instantly came the deafening sound of an explosion.</p>

  <p>"Here, quick!" shouted Bickerson, and the second detective flew down the
  stairs into the kitchen.</p>

  <p>The bald man lay in a huddled heap on the floor, within reach of his hand
  a revolver, the barrel of which was still smoking.</p>

  <p>"Get on the 'phone&mdash;there is one here. Call an ambulance and the
  divisional surgeon, though I don't think he'll be much use. And keep that
  girl out!" he said sharply.</p>

  <p>There was little need to tell Jessie what had happened. With a wild scream
  she flew toward the open door, but the detective caught her in his arms and
  carried the struggling, demented girl back to the dining-room.</p>

  <p>By the time the police surgeon and the ambulance arrived, Bickerson had
  made a very thorough search of the man's clothes, and the kitchen table was
  strewn with the articles he had removed.</p>

  <p>"He's dead," said the surgeon. "Suicide&mdash;in fear of arrest, I
  presume?"</p>

  <p>Bickerson nodded.</p>

  <p>"I hardly saw it happen," he said. "Not having been able to question the
  girl, I don't know what occurred, but I guess that he saw us from the window
  of the dining-room&mdash;I noticed the blind move." He thought a moment. "It
  was a lucky shot for that poor, howling female," he added.</p>

  <p>Elsa read the news in the late editions of the evening papers. She was
  inured to shock, and save that her sympathetic heart softened toward the poor
  girl who had saved her from untold horrors, she had no feeling save an almost
  savage satisfaction that the man who was in some way responsible for Paul
  Amery's suffering had gone to his account.</p>

  <p>She dared not let her mind rest upon the sinister man and his fate. Again
  and again she told herself that he was alive. She sat at her table, her hands
  clasped before her, praying that the bell might ring, and that his sharp
  voice might call her in to him; and it was only when the evening came, and
  she found herself alone in the building, that for the first time she broke
  down and gave way to a flood of passionate weeping.</p>

  <p>Her head was aching, her eyes hot and painful; misery was coiled about her
  heart until it was a pain to breathe; but at last she flung off her sorrow,
  and, bathing her face, went out, not knowing whither and caring nothing.</p>

  <p>"Elsa!"</p>

  <p>As she reached the street a familiar voice called her and she turned.
  Ralph Hallam was standing on the sidewalk, his debonair self.</p>

  <p>"I am not going back to Herbert Mansions, Dr. Hallam," she said
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"I know," he nodded. "I've taken a room for you at the Palace. Lou has
  sent your things there."</p>

  <p>The girl hesitated. She had come to regard Ralph Hallam in the light of an
  enemy. That he hated Amery she knew, and it almost hurt her to accept even
  this slight service at his hands.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said simply, and then: "You've heard about Jessie's
  father?"</p>

  <p>"Dame? Yes. He was mixed up in a scandal of some kind, and shot himself
  when the police went to arrest him."</p>

  <p>She walked slowly down Wood Street and he kept pace at her side, well
  aware that his presence was objectionable to her.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you think I am a pretty bad egg," he said.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you are or not," she answered listlessly. "I'm
  really beyond caring."</p>

  <p>"You don't trust me, at any rate?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Will you do me one favour?"</p>

  <p>She stopped and looked at him, suspicion lurking in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Will you come to Half Moon Street and let me tell you the whole
  truth&mdash;the truth about myself, and the truth, that I have recently
  learnt, about Amery?"</p>

  <p>She knew the truth about Amery&mdash;that he loved her! That was the
  vital, triumphant truth that eclipsed and obliterated all others.</p>

  <p>"I would much rather not," she said. "Besides, there is nothing for me to
  know about Major Amery. He has already told me."</p>

  <p>"Do you know that Amery was a detective&mdash;Is a detective, I
  mean&mdash;" he added hastily, and, seeing that he had startled her, he went
  on: "Amery is on the staff of the Foreign Office Intelligence Department, and
  was brought from India to cope with the drug traffic. I never guessed he was
  working with Bickerson, but he is, Feng Ho told me last night. They say he is
  the cleverest intelligence officer that has ever served in India. He has been
  fighting out there with Soyoka's crowd, and his agents have been everywhere.
  Sometimes they pretended to be working for one of the gangs, like that man
  Moropoulos, the Greek, who was a detective from Washington. He has strangled
  my business; half the crowd I've been working with are under arrest and I
  expect to be pinched at any moment. It was Amery who put the police into
  Stebbing's Bank. Tupperwill was Soyoka's principal agent; he made a fortune
  out of dope, but Amery has finished him! Elsa, I don't know what is going to
  happen to me, and I may never be able to ask you again to dine. Lou will be
  there."</p>

  <p>Again she hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I'll come," she said, "but I must first go to the hotel and unpack."</p>

  <p>"You can do that later," he urged.</p>

  <p>There was something in his eagerness which she did not understand, and
  which did not quite fit in with his frankness.</p>

  <p>"I will go with you, but I won't stay late, I have a feeling that I'm
  being a fool, but I'll take the risk."</p>

  <p>She did not see the smile that flitted across his face as he helped her
  into the taxi, but she noticed that he was most anxious to entertain her on
  the journey to the house, and hardly stopped speaking once.</p>

  <p>"Tupperwill, for some reason, wanted to hold you, I think, as a hostage.
  It may have been just fondness for you, and it may have been a knowledge of
  Amery's mind. He called you out one afternoon, didn't he, to meet him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"But he asked you first whether Major Amery was out? He said you were to
  come at once, but you met Amery before you left, and told him where you were
  going? Tupperwill had a great little scheme for kidnapping you. The car was
  to drive into a yard at Islington, and you were to be taken out and held till
  the night, when you were to be moved somewhere else. But just before the car
  turned into the gate, you happened to mention the fact that Amery knew, and
  he changed his plans. Do you remember?"</p>

  <p>Then that was the explanation! And Feng Ho must have been following her!
  Only now she was beginning to realize the care with which the sinister man
  had surrounded her, and at the thought of him her lips trembled. It was just
  then they reached Half Moon Street. He jumped out first. As she stepped from
  the cab, the door opened, and he almost rushed her into the house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap54"
     id="chap54">LIV. WILLE SAYS "NO!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SUPERINTENDENT WILLE was by nature a sceptical and
  unbelieving man. In nine cases out of ten he had found, in the course of a
  long and interesting life, that his suspicions were justified; and now, as he
  presided over a conference of minor officials of Scotland Yard, he enlarged
  upon the creed of disbelief.</p>

  <p>"That girl told the truth, Bickerson," he said definitely. "If it was not
  the truth, why did Dame commit suicide the moment you went to arrest him? And
  if she told the truth in one particular, she told the truth in another. We
  have had the statement of Hallam, that he and the Chinaman went in pursuit of
  the cab which carried away Major Amery and Miss Marlowe. In confirmation, we
  have Feng Ho struck down in the open street, probably in the act of pursuit;
  and now we have the suicide of Dame."</p>

  <p>"But the girl Dame said&mdash;" began Bickerson.</p>

  <p>"I'm not taking much notice of what the daughter said. It was her duty to
  lie on behalf of her father, and well you guessed she was lying!"</p>

  <p>Bickerson could do no more than agree.</p>

  <p>"The garage, the pit, the threat of murder, the abduction&mdash;they all
  hang together," Wille went on deliberately, "and the fact that there is no
  body in the pit proves nothing, except that no murder was committed in the
  shed. It does not prove that it was not committed elsewhere, or that Dame was
  not privy to the act. We have Dame's record: he was a man with three
  convictions, and ex-convicts of his mental calibre do not commit suicide to
  avoid Dartmoor, but to keep their feet off the sliding trap of Pentonville.
  Therefore, I argue that there has been a murder&mdash;somewhere. What is the
  time?" He looked at his watch. "Half-past nine. Do you know where Miss
  Marlowe is to be found?"</p>

  <p>"I believe she's staying at Herbert Mansions," said Bickerson.</p>

  <p>"Go along and, bring her back here. We will have her story tested in the
  light of our subsequent discoveries. You boys can hang on," he said to the
  little knot of detectives, major and minor.</p>

  <p>At Herbert Mansions, Bickerson interviewed Mrs. Hallam.</p>

  <p>"No, she's not here," said that self-possessed lady. "As a matter of fact,
  my husband took a room for her at the Palace Hotel, and all her trunks were
  sent there this afternoon."</p>

  <p>This statement Bickerson confirmed. The trunks and bags had arrived and
  had been sent up to Miss Marlowe's room, but she herself had not arrived.</p>

  <p>"You're sure?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the reception clerk. "Miss Marlowe hasn't taken her key
  yet," and he lifted it down from the hook behind him.</p>

  <p>To make absolutely certain, a page was sent to the room and returned with
  the news that it was not occupied.</p>

  <p>"She couldn't very well come in without our knowledge," said the
  clerk.</p>

  <p>Bickerson was more disturbed than Superintendent Wille would have
  imagined. He remembered there was a night watchman at Amery's office, and got
  connected up with him at once.</p>

  <p>"Miss Marlowe left the office rather late, sir&mdash;nearly seven o'clock,
  I think."</p>

  <p>"Did she go alone?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, Dr. Hallam was with her. He had been waiting outside the door
  for the best part of two hours."</p>

  <p>He did not call up Ralph, preferring to make a personal visit. It was a
  long time before his knock procured attention. He saw a light appear in the
  passage, and Ralph opened the door to him.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! What do you want this time?" he asked cheerfully. "Are you taking
  me for knifing the Chinaman?"</p>

  <p>"We'll discuss the Chinaman at another time," said Bickerson coldly, "and
  then I shall ask you to explain why you lied to me about finding him and
  taking him to the hospital. At the moment, I want to know something about
  Miss Elsa Marlowe, with whom, I understand, you were seen at seven o'clock
  this evening."</p>

  <p>"Which is perfectly true," admitted Ralph. "I called for her at the
  office; in fact, I waited there some time for her."</p>

  <p>"And then?" asked Bickerson.</p>

  <p>"Then I drove her to Notting Hill. She was going to call on the girl
  Dame."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you didn't bring her here?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly sure," said Ralph coolly. "Miss Marlowe hasn't been in this
  house in weeks. My servant is out, or he would support my statement that I
  returned alone."</p>

  <p>His eyes did not waver under the detective's gaze.</p>

  <p>"She was seen coming in here," he bluffed.</p>

  <p>"Then whoever saw her suffers from illusions," replied Ralph. "I tell you
  she has not been inside this house. She is probably at the Palace Hotel,
  where I took a room on her behalf."</p>

  <p>With this story Bickerson had to return to his chief.</p>

  <p>"She's not at Dame's house," said Wille decisively. "The police are in
  possession, and Miss Dame has been taken to the home of a distant
  relative."</p>

  <p>They looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"I don't like it," said the Superintendent. "Whoever was responsible for
  getting the girl away last night is taking care of her to-night. Warn all
  stations, with a full description; patrolmen to be notified that the girl
  must be detained wherever and whenever she is found. At nine o'clock
  to-morrow morning all officers concerned in the case will meet me at Dame's
  house. I am going through that establishment with a fine comb!"</p>

  <p>Bickerson went back to his office, leaving the shrewd old Superintendent
  to make another examination of the papers and money that had been found on
  Dame's body. He was so engaged when the door was pushed open and Bickerson
  came in.</p>

  <p>"Can I have a warrant to search Hallam's house?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, you can't," grunted the Superintendent, without looking up, and
  Inspector Bickerson stared at him.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>It was not the fact that he almost pushed her into the house, but the
  quickness with which Ralph turned, locked the front door and put the key in
  his pocket, which brought the girl round in alarm.</p>

  <p>"Why did you do that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have my reasons," smiled the man.</p>

  <p>He was deadly cool. Remembering how easy it had been to arouse his anger
  or reduce him to a condition of helpless embarrassment, she could only wonder
  what had produced the change of attitude.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mrs. Hallam?"</p>

  <p>"At Herbert Mansions, so far as I know," said Hallam, without shame. "In
  fact, Elsa, I've deceived you. I wanted you here for another purpose than to
  discuss my iniquities. The night isn't long enough, anyway, to give you a
  detailed account of my numerous falls from grace."</p>

  <p>The dining-table was laid for two, but she did not attempt to sit
  down.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I'll stay," she said.</p>

  <p>"I, on the other hand, am certain that you will," he replied, "and I will
  tell you why."</p>

  <p>He beckoned her out of the room and pushed open the door of the library.
  The writing-table had been cleared of the paraphernalia which ordinarily
  littered the cloth. Instead was a typewriter, a thick pad of paper, and a
  cardboard package of carbons.</p>

  <p>"You will spend the rest of the evening in making a very detailed
  statement about my connection with the amateurs, my knowledge of Soyoka, and
  a few other particulars with which I will not bother you for the moment.
  After&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"After?" she repeated, when he paused.</p>

  <p>"You shall please yourself whether you stay or whether you go. Elsa, there
  are certain things in this house that no man or woman has ever seen,
  important actualities that Bickerson, at any rate, would give his head to see
  with his own eyes. In a few days I am leaving England and starting
  afresh&mdash;under another name, of course"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"in spite
  of the failure of Stebbing's Bank. My friend Mr. Tupperwill has disappeared,
  as you probably know. His present whereabouts are a mystery. I can assure
  you, my dear Elsa, that his disappearance has made no difference to me."</p>

  <p>The smile faded from his face and he looked at her moodily for a long
  time, and then:</p>

  <p>"Elsa, I wanted you once&mdash;wanted you very badly. And maybe it's going
  to take a long time for you to forgive me&mdash;wanting. But somebody wants
  you more than I&mdash;somebody who will not be denied."</p>

  <p>He waited for her to speak, but her lips were closed firmly. "Come," he
  said suddenly, and took her by the arm.</p>

  <p>She struggled to free herself, "Let me go&mdash;for God's sake let me go,
  Ralph!"</p>

  <p>"I can't. I swear that you shall not be hurt!" Weakened as she was, the
  grip about her arm was too powerful to to be shaken off, and she went with
  him up the stairs, scarcely knowing what she was doing.</p>

  <p>"This is your room," he pointed. "And this&mdash;" he turned the handle of
  the second door which led, as she knew, to his small drawing-room, "is the
  hiding place of a gentleman who, I regret to say, is for the moment master of
  the situation."</p>

  <p>She shrank back as he opened the door, but he pushed her in, "Here is your
  lady," he said, and pulled the door tight.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap55"
     id="chap55">LV. THE PIT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT nine o'clock in the morning a small knot of plain-
  clothes police passed into the Dames' house and filed into the dining-room.
  Superintendent Wille was the last to arrive, and with him were two men in
  labourers' clothing, carrying spades.</p>

  <p>Bickerson, who had been in the place half an hour and had already
  completed his search of the upper rooms, came down at the sound of voices and
  joined the party.</p>

  <p>"You have found nothing?" asked Wille.</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever, except a number of old clothes, and evidence that the
  place has been used as a sort of headquarters by Dame's crowd."</p>

  <p>Wille led the way down into the kitchen. The dark stains of Dame's blood
  still showed on the floor, but he had a less morbid interest in the
  place.</p>

  <p>"There is the pantry, exactly as the girl described it," he said, and
  pulled open the door. "And there is the bed."</p>

  <p>He examined the door again, tried the hasp and picked up from the floor a
  padlock in which was a key; from the key hung a ring with many others.</p>

  <p>"I agree that Miss Marlowe's story has plenty of corroboration," said
  Bickerson, a little crestfallen. "In fact, I don't think I've handled this
  case as well as I might."</p>

  <p>"As you had other matters on hand you couldn't be expected to," said the
  Superintendent gruffly. "I'm not pretending that the case was easy. It
  wasn't. From the first it has been a Chinese puzzle." He opened the door
  leading into the garden and stepped out. "There is the shed at the bottom of
  the garden; have you got the key?"</p>

  <p>Bickerson nodded and pulled out two keys tied with red tape. Wille, taking
  them from his band, walked down the path and, swinging open the heavy door,
  stepped inside.</p>

  <p>He looked down at the earth-filled break in the concrete floor and then at
  the walls.</p>

  <p>"And there is the ring bolt," he said. "You saw that? You remember how
  Miss Marlowe in her statemeat described the bolt through which a chain was
  drawn&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly and touched the wall above the place where the ring
  protruded.</p>

  <p>"Do you see those?"</p>

  <p>There were four pear-shaped stains on the brick wall. "They may be blood
  or they may not. Look, there are others on the floor!"</p>

  <p>He went to the door and called in the labourers.</p>

  <p>"Open that hole," he said, "and dig down until you can dig no deeper."</p>

  <p>They strolled out into the garden whilst the men began their work.</p>

  <p>"Do you think Amery is dead?" asked Bickerson.</p>

  <p>"I thought so yesterday; I'm not so sure today," was the Superintendent's
  reply, and then: "Did you have this pit thoroughly cleared?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. I went down as far as the pipes; beyond that it was
  unnecessary to go."</p>

  <p>"What time did you do this?"</p>

  <p>"Early yesterday morning, about eight o'clock."</p>

  <p>"And you found nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all."</p>

  <p>"Did you fill in the pit afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Bickerson. "Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"And you locked both doors? Are there any other keys?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I know there aren't, but probably there are."</p>

  <p>"You should have sealed the doors," grumbled Wille. He walked up the
  garden path, stopping now and again to look at one of the flower-beds, or to
  poke with his stick a heap of loose earth, and he was so engaged when the
  voice of one of the labourers called him, and he hurried back.</p>

  <p>"There is a body here, sir," said the man.</p>

  <p>They were crowding round the doorway to look in at the dreadful sight,
  when Bickerson, turning his head, saw a man coming out of the kitchen&mdash;a
  tall, lean man, with a white bandage about his dark forehead, and a queer,
  cynical smile on his thin lips.</p>

  <p>"Amery!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>Amery did not answer, until he came up to the staring group, and then:
  "Have you found the body?"</p>

  <p>Wille nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid you had," said Amery. "It is Tupperwill&mdash;I killed him!
  It was an accident. He had me chained up to the wall, and had given me one
  blow, when I managed to get my hands clear of the handcuffs and struck back
  at him. Again, by a lucky chance, his infernal stick caught me and almost
  knocked me out. If I had fallen then it would not have been Tupperwill's s
  body you would be finding! By the greatest good luck I caught him on the
  point and knocked him backward. His head caught the edge of the pit and he
  crumpled up and fell."</p>

  <p>A long and a painful pause.</p>

  <p>"I hope he was dead," he said softly. "I hope he was dead!" And they knew
  he was thinking of another dreadful possibility.</p>

  <p>"You have made a very serious statement, Major Amery," said Bickerson.
  "You may be able to explain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm making another. Put up your hands, Stillman. Put 'em up!"</p>

  <p>Bickerson's hands went up; his face had the pallor of death.</p>

  <p>"You'll find in his inside waistcoat pocket a most perfectly constructed
  beard. At the European Bank in Threadneedle Street, Superintendent, you will
  discover a balance in his name that will stagger you. Crook from the day he
  put on uniform, to the culmination of his career, when he succeeded in
  joining the Soyoka gang, there isn't a straight place in his life."</p>

  <p>A pair of handcuffs snapped about the detective's wrists, and two of his
  former comrades hurried him through the house into the car that was
  waiting.</p>

  <p>Wille took the arm of the sinister man, and together they walked out of
  earshot.</p>

  <p>"I got your message last night. How did you finally escape?"</p>

  <p>"I mightn't have got away at all, for Bickerson was somewhere in the
  garden, and I was as weak as a rat from loss of blood. Fortunately, I managed
  to get the door open that led into the lane, but even here Stillman might
  have finished what the other devil began, only there was somebody waiting for
  me&mdash;the last person in the world I expected to find."</p>

  <p>"Not Hallam?" gasped Wille.</p>

  <p>"Hallam it was," nodded the Major with a little wince of pain. "There is
  another kind of crook. God makes them in many ways. He got me out of the
  lane, took me home, put me to bed and dressed the injury. There's this excuse
  for his being a crook, that he's a pretty bad surgeon! But he was good to me,
  and did it all without any hope that he would escape the consequence of his
  own misdoings."</p>

  <p>"Then Bickerson killed Tarn?" said Wille.</p>

  <p>"Who else? It could only be Bickerson or Hallam. Tarn had got a telegram,
  which came to my office in error. It was from a man who used to be one of
  Tarn's agents. In the course of that wire the sender was indiscreet enough to
  mention the name of Tupperwill. Now, here is the curious thing about the Tarn
  murder. Hallam was scared to death that Tarn intended betraying his crowd,
  and he got to know that the old man had an appointment that night with
  Bickerson. In order to stop him talking, knowing something of his habits, he
  doped the old man's brandy, thinking that that would carry him over till the
  next morning and make his confession impossible.</p>

  <p>"To make absolutely sure, he called on Bickerson, and found that the
  inspector was on the point of going to his appointment. Now, Bickerson knew
  that Maurice Tarn was engaged in the dope trade, but I doubt then if he had
  any intention of injuring him, until he learnt by telephone that Tarn knew
  the head of the Soyoka gang. He allowed Hallam to go with him so that, in the
  event of any trouble, the blame could be shifted. By an extraordinary
  coincidence, my man Feng Ho had gone into the house that night to make an
  examination, and switched out the lights in order to test the old man's
  wakefulness, so that, when they went into the study, all the circumstances
  were favourable to the commission of the crime. In the darkness Bickerson
  leant down, felt for the heart and drove the knife home. The blood on his
  hands could easily be accounted for&mdash;he was the only man who had handled
  the body.</p>

  <p>"Two factors occurred to frighten him. The first was the presence in the
  room of Miss Marlowe, and the second the intrusion of Feng Ho."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said the police chief. "It's a pity Dame committed
  suicide&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dame was murdered," was the calm reply. "He was shot down by Bickerson as
  he entered the kitchen, and for an excellent reason! Dame, at a critical
  moment, broke down, showed weakness which decided his fate."</p>

  <p>"Did Bickerson know that Tupperwill was dead?"</p>

  <p>The Major shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said quietly, "that was the one shock that Mr. Bickerson
  had&mdash;that Tupperwill and not I lay in the grave that he had so carefully
  dug. But he knew that Tupperwill had disappeared, and was scared. That was
  why he invented the story of having seen the banker.</p>

  <p>"There is one favour I have to ask: it is that a suitcase, which you will
  find in Bickerson's lodgings, should be handed to me intact. I tell you
  frankly that it contains money earned by Tarn and Hallam in the course of
  their nefarious practice, and I suggest that the money be passed along,
  because, if it comes to a matter of law, there are going to be a whole lot of
  complications which would be best avoided."</p>

  <p>"What will you do with Hallam? There's a warrant out for him."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I should execute the warrant if I were you," said Amery
  quietly. "I learnt last night one curious thing. Tupperwill, who must have
  known that Maurice Tarn's money had disappeared, tried to work on Hallam's
  feelings by telling him that I had the money in a box at Stebbing's Bank. He
  hoped to induce the doctor to go after me&mdash;for Tupperwill and Bickerson
  knew me for what I was. As to Hallam&mdash;the two gangs are broken, and
  unless I am mistaken, by this time Bickerson is dead."</p>

  <p>"Dead!" said the startled Superintendent.</p>

  <p>"He carried cyanide tablets loose in his waistcoat pocket," said Amery,
  "and if he is an intelligent man he will find them before he is
  searched."</p>

  <p>"And now," he said, looking at his watch, "I am going back to my neglected
  business. I am out of police work for good. From henceforward, point to me as
  a rising City merchant with aspirations to the Common Council."</p>

  <p>It was a glorious morning, and as his cab carried him back slowly through
  the tangle of City traffic, his thoughts were far away from death and danger,
  from that hideous night in the Dame's garage, from the pit and the Thing that
  went down to it. His work was done, the labour of years finished. There might
  be a trial; there would certainly be an inquest, and he would figure as part
  of a nine days' wonder. But after that there was work, and a serene future,
  and a girl into whose soul he had looked.</p>

  <p>Ralph Hallam was waiting for him when he arrived.</p>

  <p>"Well, was it as you thought?"</p>

  <p>Amery nodded.</p>

  <p>"Now what of me?"</p>

  <p>"Come to my house to-night," said Amery. "I will give you part of the
  contents of the suitcase, unless friend Wille changes his mind. The remainder
  I purpose sending to a charity. Miss Marlowe did not come with you?"</p>

  <p>"No, Lou told me she was asleep."</p>

  <p>Amery bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"It was good of your wife to stay with Elsa last night. By the way, are
  you going to your unknown destination&mdash;alone?"</p>

  <p>Ralph scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"N-no," he said. "I think I shall make a desperate attempt to be
  respectable. Lou isn't exactly an inspiration, but she's a warning!"</p>

  <p>He was scarcely out of Wood Street, and had crossed Cheapside, when he saw
  the girl go up the street and pass between the ancient portals.</p>

  <p>Of a truth this was a day of wonder and magic to Elsa Marlowe; for in the
  darkness of the night, in a room where she had expected terror, she had met
  the face of her dreams, and heard a voice beloved over all, and had felt the
  strength of the enfolding arms.</p>

  <p>The sky above was blue, flecked by clouds as fine and white as the veil of
  a bride. She came into her office, hung up her hat and prepared the
  typewriter for a joyous day. And then, before she could sit down, the bell
  rang.</p>

  <p>Her heart was beating at a tremendous rate as she turned the handle and
  went in.</p>

  <p>"Do you want anything&mdash;Major Amery?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I want you to kiss me," he said.</p>

  <p>She stooped over him and their lips met. Then: "Take this," he said, in
  that old, gruff tone of his, and with a little laugh she sat down, opened her
  book. The trembling pencil was making lines of its own, when he
  began:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"To the Manager of the Monte Rosa Hotel, Como, Italy.</p>

  <p class="letter">"In a month's time I am bringing my wife to Como, and I
  should be glad if you would reserve me a suite...!"</p>
