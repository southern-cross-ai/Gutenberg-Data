  <h2><a name="chap01"
     id="chap01">I. THE HEAD-HUNTER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CAPTAIN MIKE BRIXAN had certain mild and innocent
  superstitions. He believed, for example, that if he saw a green crow in a
  field he would certainly see another green crow before the day was out. And
  when, at the bookstand on Aix-la-Chapelle station, he saw and purchased a
  dime novel that was comprehensively entitled "Only an Extra, or the Pride of
  Hollywood", he was less concerned as to how this thrilling and dog-eared
  romance came to be on offer at half a million marks (this was in the days
  when marks were worth money) than as to the circumstances in which he would
  again hear or read the word "extras" in the sense of a supernumerary and
  unimportant screen actress.</p>

  <p>The novel did not interest him at all. He read one page of superlatives
  and turned for relief to the study of a Belgian time-table. He was bored, but
  not so bored that he could interest himself in the sensational rise of the
  fictitious Rosa Love from modest obscurity to a press agent and wealth.</p>

  <p>But "extra" was a new one on Michael, and he waited for the day to bring
  its inevitable companion.</p>

  <p>To say that he was uninterested in crime, that burglars were less
  thrilling than golf scores, and the record of murders hardly worth the
  reading, might convey a wrong impression to those who knew him as the
  cleverest agent in the Foreign Office Intelligence Department.</p>

  <p>His official life was spent in meeting queer Continentals in obscure
  restaurants and, in divers roles, to learn of the undercurrents that were
  drifting the barques of diplomacy to unsuspected ports. He had twice roamed
  through Europe in the guise of an open-mouthed tourist; had canoed many
  hundred miles through the gorges of the Danube to discover, in little
  riverside beer-houses, the inward meanings of secret mobilizations. These
  were tasks wholly to his liking.</p>

  <p>Therefore he was not unnaturally annoyed when he was withdrawn from Berlin
  at a moment when, as it seemed, the mystery of the Slovak Treaty was in a way
  to being solved, for he had secured, at a cost, a rough but accurate
  draft.</p>

  <p>"I should have had a photograph of the actual document if you had left me
  another twenty-four hours," he reproached his chief, Major George Staines,
  when he reported himself at Whitehall next morning.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," replied that unrepentant man, "but the truth is, we've had a
  heart-to-heart talk with the Slovakian Prime Minister, and he has promised to
  behave and practically given us the text of the treaty&mdash;it was only a
  commercial affair. Mike, did you know Elmer?"</p>

  <p>The Foreign Office detective sat down on the edge of the table.</p>

  <p>"Have you brought me from Berlin to ask me that?" he demanded bitterly.
  "Have you taken me from my favourite café on Unter den Linden&mdash;by the
  way, the Germans are making small-arm ammunition by the million at a
  converted pencil factory in Bavaria&mdash;to discuss Elmer? He's a clerk,
  isn't he?"</p>

  <p>Major Staines nodded.</p>

  <p>"He was," he said, "in the Accountancy Department. He disappeared from
  view three weeks ago, and an examination of his books showed that he had been
  systematically stealing funds which were under his control."</p>

  <p>Mike Brixan made a little face.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to hear that," he said. "He seemed to be a fairly quiet and
  inoffensive man. But surely you don't want me to go after him? That is a job
  for Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to go after him," said Staines slowly, "because
  &mdash;well, he has been found."</p>

  <p>There was something very significant and sinister in his tone, and, before
  he could take the little slip of paper from the portfolio on the desk,
  Michael Brixan knew what was coming.</p>

  <p>"Not the Head-Hunter?" he gasped. Even Michael knew about the
  Head-Hunter.</p>

  <p>Staines nodded. "Here's the note."</p>

  <p>He handed the typewritten slip across to his subordinate, and Michael
  read:</p>

  <p class="typewriter">"You will find a box in the hedge by the railway arch
  at Esher. The Head-Hunter."</p>

  <p>"The Head-Hunter!" repeated Michael mechanically, and whistled.</p>

  <p>"We found the box, and, of course, we found the unfortunate Elmer's head,
  sliced neatly from his body," said Staines. "This is the twelfth head in
  seven years," Staines went on, "and in almost every case&mdash;in fact, in
  every case except two&mdash;the victim has been a fugitive from justice. Even
  if the treaty question had not been settled, Mike, I should have brought you
  back."</p>

  <p>"But this is a police job," said the young man, troubled.</p>

  <p>"Technically you're a policeman," interrupted his chief, "and the Foreign
  Secretary wishes you to take this case in hand, and he does this with the
  full approval of the Secretary of State, who of course controls Scotland
  Yard. So far, the death of Francis Elmer and the discovery of his gruesome
  remains have not been given out to the Press. There was such a fuss last time
  that the police want to keep this quiet. They have had an inquest&mdash;I
  guess the jury was picked, but it would be high treason to say so&mdash;and
  the usual verdict has been returned. The only information I can give you is
  that Elmer was seen by his niece a week ago in Chichester. We discovered this
  before the man's fate was known. The girl, Adele Leamington, is working for
  the Knebworth Film Corporation, which has its studio in Chichester. Old
  Knebworth is an American and a very good sort. The girl is a sort of
  super-chorus-extra, that's the word&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Michael gasped.</p>

  <p>"Extra! I knew that infernal word would turn up again! Go on, sir
  &mdash;what do you wish me to do?"</p>

  <p>"Go along and see her," said the chief. "Here is the address."</p>

  <p>"Is there a Mrs. Elmer?" asked Michael as he put the slip into his pocket.
  The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but she can throw no light upon the murder. She, by the way, is the
  only person who knows he is dead. She had not seen her husband for a month,
  and apparently they had been more or less separated for years. She benefits
  considerably by his death, for he was well insured in her favour."</p>

  <p>Michael read again the gruesome note from the Head-Hunter.</p>

  <p>"What is your theory about this?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"The general idea is that he is a lunatic who feels called upon to mete
  out punishment to defaulters. But the two exceptions disturb that theory
  pretty considerably."</p>

  <p>Staines lay back in his chair, a puzzled frown on his face.</p>

  <p>"Take the case of Willitt. His head was found on Clapham Common two years
  ago. Willitt was a well off man, the soul of honesty; well liked, and he had
  a very big balance at his bank. Crewling, the second exception, who was one
  of the first of the Hunter's victims, was also above suspicion, though in his
  case there is no doubt he was mentally unbalanced a few weeks before his
  death.</p>

  <p>"The typewritten notification has invariably been typed out on the same
  machine. In every case you have the half-obliterated 'u', the faint 'g', and
  the extraordinary alignment which the experts are unanimous in ascribing to a
  very old and out-of-date Kost machine. Find the man who uses that typewriter
  and you have probably found the murderer. But it is very unlikely that he
  will ever be found that way, for the police have published photographs
  pointing out the peculiarities of type, and I should imagine that Mr. Hunter
  does not use this machine except to announce the demise of his victims."</p>

  <p>Michael Brixan went back to his flat, a little more puzzled and a little
  more worried by his unusual commission. He moved and had his being in the
  world of high politics. The finesses of diplomacy were his peculiar study,
  and the normal abnormalities of humanity, the thefts and murders and
  larcencies which occupied the attention of the constabulary, did not come
  into his purview.</p>

  <p>"Bill," said he, addressing the small terrier that lay on the hearth-rug
  before the fireless grate of his sitting-room, "this is where I fall down.
  But whether I do or not, I'm going to meet an extra&mdash;ain't that
  grand?"</p>

  <p>Bill wagged his tail agreeably.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02">II. MR. SAMPSON LONGVALE CALLS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ADELE LEAMINGTON waited till the studio was almost empty
  before she came to where the white-haired man sat crouched in his canvas
  chair, his hands thrust into his trousers pockets, a malignant scowl on his
  forehead. It was not a propitious moment to approach him: nobody knew that
  better than she.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Knebworth, may I speak to you?"</p>

  <p>He looked up slowly. Ordinarily he would have risen, for this middle-aged
  American in normal moments was the soul of courtesy. But just at that moment
  his respect for womanhood was something below zero.</p>

  <p>His look was blank, though the director in him instinctively approved her
  values. She was pretty, with regular features and a mop of brown hair in
  which the sunshine of childhood still lingered. Her mouth firm, delicately
  shaped, her figure slim&mdash;perfect in many ways.</p>

  <p>Jack had seen many beautiful extras in his career, and had passed through
  stages of enthusiasm and despair as he had seen them translated to the
  screen&mdash;pretty wooden figures without soul or expression, gauche of
  movement, hopeless. Too pretty to be clever, too conscious of their beauty to
  be natural. Dolls without intelligence or initiative &mdash;just "extras" who
  could wear clothes in a crowd, who could smile and dance mechanically; fit
  for extras and nothing else all the days of their lives.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked brusquely.</p>

  <p>"Is there a part I could play in this production, Mr. Knebworth?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>His shaven lips curled.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you playing a part, Miss&mdash;can't remember your name
  &mdash;Leamington, is it?"</p>

  <p>"I'm certainly playing&mdash;I'm one of the figures in the background,"
  she smiled. "I don't want a big part, but I'm sure I could do better than I
  have done."</p>

  <p>"I'm mighty sure you couldn't do worse than some people," he growled. "No,
  there's no part for you, friend. There'll be no story to shoot unless things
  alter. That's what!"</p>

  <p>She was going away when he recalled her.</p>

  <p>"Left a good home, I guess?" he said. "Thought picture-making meant a
  million dollars a year an' a new automobile every Thursday? Or maybe you were
  holding down a good job as a stenographer and got it under your toque that
  you'd make Hollywood feel small if you got your chance? Go back home, kid,
  and tell the old man that a typewriter's got a sunlight arc beaten to death
  as an instrument of commerce."</p>

  <p>The girl smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"I didn't come into pictures because I was stage-struck, if that is what
  you mean, Mr. Knebworth. I came in knowing just how hard a life it might be.
  I have no parents."</p>

  <p>He looked up at her curiously.</p>

  <p>"How do you live?" he asked. "There's no money in 'extra' work &mdash;not
  on this lot, anyway. Might be if I was one of those billion-dollar directors
  who did pictures with chariot races. But I don't. My ideal picture has got
  five characters."</p>

  <p>"I have a little income from my mother, and I write." said the girl.</p>

  <p>She stopped as she saw him looking, past her to the studio entrance, and,
  turning her head, saw a remarkable figure standing in the doorway. At first
  she thought it was an actor who had made up for a film test.</p>

  <p>The newcomer was an old man, but his great height and erect carriage would
  not have conveyed that impression at a distance. The tight-fitting tail-coat,
  the trousers strapped to his boots, the high collar and black satin stock
  belonged to a past age, though they were newly made. The white linen bands
  that showed at his wrists were goffered, his double-breasted waist coat of
  grey velvet was fastened by golden buttons.</p>

  <p>He might have stepped from a family portrait of one of those dandies of
  the 'fifties. He held a tall hat in a gloved hand, a hat with a curly brim,
  and in the other a gold-topped walking-stick. The face, deeply lined, was
  benevolent and kind, and he seemed unconscious of his complete baldness.</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth was out of his chair in a second and walked toward the
  stranger.</p>

  <p>"Why, Mr. Longvale, I am glad to see you&mdash;did you get my letter? I
  can't tell you how much obliged I am to you for the loan of your house."</p>

  <p>Sampson Longvale of the Dower House! She remembered now. He was known in
  Chichester as "the old-fashioned gentleman", and once, when she was out on
  location, somebody had pointed out the big, rambling house, with its
  weed-grown garden and crumbling walls, where he lived.</p>

  <p>"I thought I would come over and see you," said the big man.</p>

  <p>His voice was rich and beautifully modulated. She did not remember having
  heard a voice quite as sweet, and she looked at the eccentric figure with a
  new interest.</p>

  <p>"I can only hope that the house and grounds are suitable to your
  requirements. I am afraid they are in sad disorder, but I cannot afford to
  keep the estate in the same condition as my grandfather did."</p>

  <p>"Just what I want, Mr. Longvale. I was afraid you might be offended when I
  told you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The old gentleman interrupted him with a soft laugh.</p>

  <p>"No, no, I wasn't offended, I was amused. You needed a haunted house: I
  could even supply that quality, though I will not promise you that my family
  ghost will walk. The Dower House has been haunted for hundreds of years. A
  former occupant in a fit of frenzy murdered his daughter there, and the
  unhappy lady is supposed to walk. I have never seen her, though many years
  ago one of my servants did. Fortunately, I am relieved of that form of
  annoyance: I no longer keep servants in the house," he smiled, "though, if
  you care to stay the night, I shall be honoured to entertain five or six of
  your company."</p>

  <p>Knebworth heaved a sigh of relief. He had made diligent inquiries and
  found that it was almost impossible to secure lodgings in the neighbourhood,
  and he was most anxious to take night pictures, and for one scene he
  particularly desired the peculiar light value which he could only obtain in
  the early hours of the morning.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that would give you a lot of trouble, Mr. Longvale," he said.
  "And here and now I think we might discuss that delicate subject
  of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The old man stopped him with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"If you are going to speak of money, please don't," he said firmly. "I am
  interested in cinematography; in fact, I am interested in most modern things.
  We old men are usually prone to decry modernity, but I find my chiefest
  pleasure in the study of those scientific wonders which this new age has
  revealed to us."</p>

  <p>He looked at the director quizzically.</p>

  <p>"Some day you shall take a picture of me in the one role in which I think
  I should have no peer&mdash;a picture of me in the role of my illustrious
  ancestor."</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth stared, half amused, half startled. It was no unusual
  experience to find people who wished to see themselves on the screen, but he
  never expected that little piece of vanity from Mr. Sampson Longvale.</p>

  <p>"I should be glad," he said formally. "Your people were pretty well known,
  I guess?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Longvale sighed.</p>

  <p>"It is my regret that I do not come from the direct line that included
  Charles Henry, the most historic member of my family. He was my great-uncle.
  I come from the Bordeaux branch of Longvales, which has made history, sir."
  He shook his head regretfully.</p>

  <p>"Are you French, Mr. Longvale?" asked Jack.</p>

  <p>Apparently the old man did not hear him. He was staring into space. Then,
  with a start: "Yes, yes, we were French. My great-grandfather married an
  English lady whom he met in peculiar circumstances. We came to England in the
  days of the directorate."</p>

  <p>Then, for the first time, he seemed aware of Adele's presence, and bowed
  toward her.</p>

  <p>"I think I must go," he said, taking a huge gold watch from his fob
  pocket.</p>

  <p>The girl watched them as they passed out of the hall, and presently she
  saw the "old-fashioned gentleman" pass the window, driving the
  oldest-fashioned car she had ever seen. It must have been one of the first
  motor-cars ever introduced into the country&mdash;a great, upstanding,
  cumbersome machine, that passed with a thunderous sound and at no great speed
  down the gravel drive out of sight.</p>

  <p>Presently Jack Knebworth came slowly back.</p>

  <p>"This craze for being screened certainly gets 'em&mdash;old or young," he
  said. "Good night, Miss&mdash;forget your name&mdash;Leamington, ain't it?
  Good night."</p>

  <p>She was half-way home before she realized that the conversation that she
  had plucked up such courage to initiate had ended unsatisfactorily for her,
  and she was as far away from her small part as ever.</p>

  there were moments when she wished it were smaller, that she might be
  justified in plucking up her courage to ask from the stout and unbending Mrs.
  Watson, her landlady, a reduction of rent. The extras on Jack Knebworth's lot
  were well paid but infrequently employed; for Jack was one of those clever
  directors who specialized in domestic stories.</p>

  <p>She was dressing when Mrs. Watson brought in her morning cup of tea.</p>

  <p>"There's a young fellow been hanging round outside since I got up." said
  Mrs. Watson. "I saw him when I took in the milk. Very polite he was, but I
  told him you weren't awake."</p>

  <p>"Did he want to see me?" asked the astonished girl.</p>

  <p>"That's what he said," said Mrs. Watson grimly. "I asked him if he came
  from Knebworth, and he said no. If you want to see him, you can have the use
  of the parlour, though I don't like young men calling on young girls. I've
  never let theatrical lodgings before, and you can't be too careful. I've
  always had a name for respectability and I want to keep it."</p>

  <p>Adele smiled.</p>

  <p>"I cannot imagine anything more respectable than an early-morning caller,
  Mrs. Watson," she said. She went downstairs and opened the door. The young
  man was standing on the side-walk with his back to her, but at the sound of
  the door opening he turned. He was good-looking and well-dressed, and his
  smile was quick and appealing.</p>

  <p>"I hope your landlady did not bother to wake you up? I could have waited.
  You are Miss Adele Leamington, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Will you come in, please?" she asked, and took him into the stuffy little
  front parlour, and, closing the door behind her, waited.</p>

  <p>"I am a reporter," he said untruthfully, and her face fell.</p>

  <p>"You've come about Uncle Francis? Is anything really wrong? They sent a
  detective to see me a week ago. Have they found him?"</p>

  <p>"No, they haven't found him," he said carefully. "You knew him very well,
  of course, Miss Leamington?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I have only seen him twice in my life. My dear father and he
  quarrelled before I was born, and I only saw him once after daddy died, and
  once before mother was taken with her fatal illness."</p>

  <p>She heard him sigh, and sensed his relief, though why he should be
  relieved that her uncle was almost a stranger to her she could not
  fathom.</p>

  <p>"You saw him at Chichester, though?" he said.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw him. I was on my way to Goodwood Park&mdash;a whole party of
  us in a char-a-banc&mdash;and I saw him for a moment walking along the
  side-walk. He looked desperately ill and worried. He was just coming out of a
  stationer's shop when I saw him; he had a newspaper under his arm and a
  letter in his hand."</p>

  <p>"Where was the store?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>She gave him the address, and he jotted it down.</p>

  <p>"You didn't see him again?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Is anything really very badly wrong?" she asked anxiously. "I've often
  heard mother say that Uncle Francis was very extravagant, and a little
  unscrupulous. Has he been in trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," admitted Michael, "he has been in trouble, but nothing that you
  need worry about. You're a great film actress, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>In spite of her anxiety she laughed.</p>

  <p>"The only chance I have of being a great film actress is for you to say so
  in your paper."</p>

  <p>"My what?" he asked, momentarily puzzled. "Oh yes, my newspaper, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you're a reporter at all," she said with sudden
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Indeed I am," he said glibly, and dared to pronounce the name of that
  widely circulated sheet upon which the sun seldom sets.</p>

  <p>"Though I'm not a great actress, and fear I never shall be, I like to
  believe it is because I've never had a chance&mdash;I've a horrible suspicion
  that Mr. Knebworth knows instinctively that I am no good."</p>

  <p>Mike Brixan had found a new interest in the case, an interest which, he
  was honest enough to confess to himself, was not dissociated from the niece
  of Francis Elmer. He had never met anybody quite so pretty and quite so
  unsophisticated and natural.</p>

  <p>"You're going to the studio, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if Mr. Knebworth would mind my calling to see you?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Knebworth doesn't like callers."</p>

  <p>"Then maybe I'll call on him," said Michael, nodding. "It doesn't matter
  whom I call on, does it?'</p>

  <p>"It certainly doesn't matter to me," said the girl coldly.</p>

  <p>"In the vulgar language of the masses," thought Mike as he strode down the
  street, "I have had the bird!"</p>

  <p>His inquiries did not occupy very much of his time. He found the little
  news shop, and the proprietor, by good fortune, remembered the coming of Mr.
  Francis Elmer.</p>

  <p>"He called for a letter, though it wasn't addressed to Elmer," said the
  shopkeeper. "A lot of people have their letters addressed here. I make a
  little extra money that way."</p>

  <p>"Did he buy a newspaper?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he did not buy a newspaper; he had one under his arm &mdash;the
  Morning Telegram. I remember that, because I noticed that he'd put a blue
  pencil mark round one of the agony advertisements on the front page, and I
  was wondering what it was all about. I kept a copy of that day's Morning
  Telegram; I've got it now."</p>

  <p>He went into the little parlour at the back of the shop and returned with
  a dingy newspaper, which he laid on the counter.</p>

  <p>"There are six there, but I don't know which one it was."</p>

  <p>Michael examined the agony advertisements. There was one frantic message
  from a mother to her son, asking him to return and saying that "all would be
  forgiven". There was a cryptogram message, which he had not time to decipher.
  A third, which was obviously the notice of an assignation. The fourth was a
  thinly veiled advertisement for a new hair-waver, and at the fifth he
  stopped. It ran:</p>

  <p>"Troubled. Final directions at address I gave you. Courage.
  Benefactor."</p>

  <p>"Some 'benefactor'," said Mike Brixan. "What was he like&mdash;the man who
  called? Was he worried?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir: he looked upset&mdash;all distracted like. He seemed like a
  chap who'd lost his head."</p>

  <p>"That seems a fair description," said Mike.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap04"
     id="chap04">IV. THE LEADING LADY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the studio of the Knebworth Picture Corporation the
  company had been waiting in its street clothes for the greater part of an
  hour.</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth sat in his conventional attitude, huddled up in his canvas
  chair, fingering his long chin and glaring from time to time at the clock
  above the studio manager's office.</p>

  <p>It was eleven when Stella Mendoza flounced in, bringing with her the
  fragrance of wood violets and a small, unhappy Peke.</p>

  <p>"Do you work to summer-time?" asked Knebworth slowly. "Or maybe you
  thought the call was for afternoon? You've kept fifty people waiting,
  Stella."</p>

  <p>"I can't help their troubles," she said with a shrug of shoulder. "You
  told me you were going on location, and naturally I didn't expect there would
  be any hurry. I had to pack my things."</p>

  <p>"Naturally you didn't think there was any hurry!" Jack Knebworth reckoned
  to have three fights a year. This was the third. The first had been with
  Stella, and the second had been with Stella, and the third was certainly to
  be with Stella.</p>

  <p>"I wanted you to be here at ten. I've had these boys and girls waiting
  since a quarter of ten."</p>

  <p>"What do you want to shoot?" she asked with an impatient jerk of her
  head.</p>

  <p>"You mostly," said Jack slowly. "Get into No. 9 outfit and don't forget to
  leave your pearl ear-rings off. You're supposed to be a half-starved chorus
  girl. We're shooting at Griff Towers, and I told the gentleman who lent us
  the use of the house that I'd be through the day work by three. If you were
  Pauline Frederick or Norma Talmadge or Lilian Gish, you'd be worth waiting
  for, but Stella Mendoza has got to be on this lot by ten&mdash;and don't
  forget it!"</p>

  <p>Old Jack Knebworth got up from his canvas chair and began to put on his
  coat with ominous deliberation, the flushed and angry girl watching him, her
  dark eyes blazing with injured pride and hurt vanity.</p>

  <p>Stella had once been plain Maggie Stubbs, the daughter of a Midland
  grocer, and old Jack had talked to her as if she were still Maggie Stubbs and
  not the great film star of coruscating brilliance, idol (or her press agent
  lied) of the screen fans of all the world.</p>

  <p>"All right, if you want a fuss you can have it, Knebworth. I'm going to
  quit&mdash;now! I think I know what is due to my position. That part's got to
  be rewritten to give me a chance of putting my personality over. There's too
  much leading man in it, anyway. People don't pay real money to see men. You
  don't treat me fair, Knebworth: I'm temperamental, I admit it. You can't
  expect a woman of my kind to be a block of wood."</p>

  <p>"The only thing about you that's a block of wood is your head, Stella,"
  grunted the producer, and went on, oblivious to the rising fury expressed in
  the girl's face, "You've had two years playing small parts in Hollywood, and
  you've brought nothing back to England but a line of fresh talk, and you
  could have gotten that out of the Sunday supplements! Temperament! That's a
  word that means doctors' certificates when a picture's half taken, and long
  rest unless your salary's put up fifty per cent. Thank God this picture isn't
  a quarter taken or an eighth. Quit, you mean-spirited guttersnipe&mdash;and
  quit as soon as you darn please!"</p>

  <p>Boiling with rage, her lips quivering so that she could not articulate,
  the girl turned and flung out of the studio.</p>

  <p>White-haired Jack Knebworth glared round at the silent company.</p>

  <p>"This is where the miracle happens," he said sardonically. "This is where
  the extra girl who's left a sick mother and a mortgage at home leaps to fame
  in a night. If you don't know that kinder thing happens on every lot in
  Hollywood you're no students of fiction. Stand forth, Mary Pickford the
  second!"</p>

  <p>The extras smiled, some amused, some uncomfortable, but none spoke. Adele
  was frozen stiff, incapable of speech.</p>

  <p>"Modesty don't belong to this industry," old Jack sneered amiably. "Who
  thinks she can play 'Roselle' in this piece&mdash;because an extra's going to
  play the part, believe me! I'm going to show this pseudo-actress that there
  isn't an extra on this lot that couldn't play her head off. Somebody talked
  about playing a part yesterday&mdash;you!"</p>

  <p>His forefinger pointed to Adele, and with a heart that beat tumultuously
  she went toward him.</p>

  <p>"I had a camera test of you six months ago," said Jack suspiciously.
  "There was something wrong with her&mdash;what was it?"</p>

  <p>He turned to his assistant. That young man scratched his head in an effort
  of memory.</p>

  <p>"Ankles?" he hazarded a guess at random&mdash;a safe guess, for Knebworth
  had views about ankles.</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong with them&mdash;get out the print and let us see it."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later Adele sat by the old man's side in the little projection
  room and saw her "test" run through.</p>

  <p>"Hair!" said Knebworth triumphantly. "I knew there was something. Don't
  like bobbed hair. Makes a girl too pert and sophisticated. You've grown it?"
  he added as the lights were switched on.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Knebworth."</p>

  <p>He looked at her in dispassionate admiration.</p>

  <p>"You'll do," he said reluctantly. "See the wardrobe and get Miss Mendoza's
  costumes. There's one thing I'd like to tell you before you go," he said,
  stopping her. "You may be good and you may be bad, but, good or bad, there's
  no future for you&mdash;so don't get heated up. The only woman who's got any
  chance in England is the producer's wife, and I'll never marry you if you go
  down on your knees to me! That's the only kind of star they know in English
  films&mdash;the producer's wife; and unless you're that, you
  haven't&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>He snapped his finger.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you a word of advice, kid. If you make good in this picture,
  link yourself up with one of those cute English directors that set three
  flats and a pot of palms and call it a drawing-room! Give Miss
  What's-her-name the script, Harry. Say&mdash;go out somewhere quiet and study
  it, will you? Harry, you see the wardrobe. I give you half an hour to read
  that script!"</p>

  <p>Like one in a dream the girl walked out into the shady garden that ran the
  length of the studio building and sat down, trying to concentrate on the
  typewritten lines. It wasn't true&mdash;it could not be true! And then she
  heard the crunch of feet on gravel and looked up in alarm. It was the young
  man who had seen her that morning&mdash;Michael Brixan.</p>

  <p>"Oh, please&mdash;you mustn't interrupt me!" she begged in agitation.
  "I've got a part&mdash;a big part&mdash;to read."</p>

  <p>Her distress was so real that he hastened to take his departure.</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully sorry&mdash;" he began</p>

  <p>In her confusion she had dropped the loose sheets of the manuscript, and,
  stooping with her to pick them up, their heads bumped.</p>

  <p>"Sorry&mdash;that's an old comedy situation, isn't it?" he began.</p>

  <p>And then he saw the sheet of paper in his hand and began to read. It was a
  page of elaborate description of a scene.</p>

  <p>The cell is large, lighted by a swinging lamp. In centre is a steel gate
  through which a soldier on guard is seen pacing to and fro&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Michael, and went white. The 'u's in the the type were
  blurred, the 'g' was indistinct. The page had been typed on the machine from
  which the Head-Hunter sent forth his gruesome tales of death.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap05"
     id="chap05">V. MR. LAWLEY FOSS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WHAT is wrong?" asked Adele, seeing the young man's grave
  face.</p>

  <p>"Where did this come from?" He showed her the sheet of typewritten
  script.</p>

  <p>"I don't know: it was with the other sheets. I knew, of course, that it
  didn't belong to 'Roselle'."</p>

  <p>"Is that the play you're acting in?" he asked quickly. And then: "Who
  would know?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Knebworth."</p>

  <p>"Where shall I find him?"</p>

  <p>"You go through that door," she said, "and you will find him on the studio
  floor."</p>

  <p>Without a word, he walked quickly into the building. Instinctively he knew
  which of the party was the man he sought. Jack Knebworth looked up under
  lowering brows at the sight of the stranger, for he was a stickler for
  privacy in business hours; but before he could demand an explanation Michael
  was up to him.</p>

  <p>"Are you Mr. Knebworth?" Jack nodded.</p>

  <p>"I surely am," he said.</p>

  <p>"May I speak to you for two minutes?"</p>

  <p>"I can't speak to anybody for one minute," growled Jack. "Who are you,
  anyway, and who let you in?"</p>

  <p>"I am a detective from the Foreign Office," said Michael lowering his
  voice, and Jack's manner changed.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong?" he asked, as he accompanied the detective into his
  sanctum.</p>

  <p>Jack laid down the sheet of paper with its typed characters on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Who wrote that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth looked at the manuscript and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've never seen it before. What is it all about?"</p>

  <p>"You've never seen this manuscript at all?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'll swear to that, but I dare say my scenario-man will know all
  about it. I'll send for him."</p>

  <p>He touched a bell, and, to the clerk who came: "Mr. Lawley Foss to come
  quickly," he said.</p>

  <p>"The reading of books, plots and material for picture plays is entirely in
  the hands of my scenario manager," he said. "I never see a manuscript until
  he considers it's worth producing; and even then, of course, the picture
  isn't always made. If the story happens to be a bad one, I don't see it at
  all. I'm not so sure that I haven't lost some good stories, because Foss
  "&mdash;he hesitated a second&mdash;"well, he and I don't see exactly eye to
  eye. Now, Mr. Brixan, what is the trouble?"</p>

  <p>In a few words Michael explained the grave significance of the typewritten
  sheet.</p>

  <p>"The Head-Hunter!" Jack whistled.</p>

  <p>There came a knock at the door, and Lawley Foss slipped into the room. He
  was a thinnish man, dark and saturnine of face, shifty of eye. His face was
  heavily lined as though he suffered from some chronic disease. But the real
  disease which preyed on Lawley Foss was the bitterness of mind that comes to
  a man it war with the world. There had been a time in his early life when he
  thought that same world was at his feet. He had written two plays that had
  been produced and had run a few nights. Thereafter, he had trudged from
  theatre to theatre in vain, for the taint of failure was on him, and no
  manager would so much as open the brown-covered manuscripts he brought to
  them. Like many another man, he had sought easy ways to wealth, but the Stock
  Exchange and the race track had impoverished him still further.</p>

  <p>He glanced suspiciously at Michael as he entered.</p>

  <p>"I want to see you, Foss, about a sheet of script that's got amongst the
  'Roselle' script," said Jack Knebworth. "May I tell Mr. Foss what you have
  told me?"</p>

  <p>Michael hesitated for a second. Some cautioning voice warned him to keep
  the question of the Head Hunter a secret. Against his better judgment he
  nodded.</p>

  <p>Lawley Foss listened with an expressionless face whilst the old director
  explained the significance of the interpolated sheet; then he took the page
  from Jack Kenilworth's hand and examined it. Not by a twitch of his face or a
  droop of his eyelid did he betray his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"We get a lot of stuff in," he said, "and I can't immediately place this
  particular play; but if you'll let me take it to my office, I will look up my
  books."</p>

  <p>Again Michael considered. He did not wish that piece of evidence to pass
  out of his hands; and yet, without confirmation and examination, it was
  fairly valueless. He reluctantly agreed.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of that fellow?" asked Jack Knebworth when the door had
  dosed upon the writer.</p>

  <p>"I don't like him," said Michael bluntly. "In fact, my first impressions
  are distinctly unfavourable, though I am probably doing the poor gentleman a
  very great injustice."</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth sighed. Foss was one of his biggest troubles, sometimes
  bulking larger than the temperamental Mendoza.</p>

  <p>"He certainly is a queer chap," he said, "though he's diabolically clever.
  I never knew a man who could take a plot and twist it as Lawley Foss
  can&mdash;but he's&mdash;difficult."</p>

  <p>"I should imagine so," said Michael dryly.</p>

  <p>They passed out into the studio and Michael sought the troubled girl to
  explain his crudeness. There were tears of vexation in her eyes when he
  approached her for his startling disappearance with a page of the script had
  put all thoughts of the play from her mind.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said penitently. "I almost wish I hadn't come."</p>

  <p>"And I quite wish it," she said, smiling in spite of herself. "What was
  the matter with that page you took&mdash;you are a detective, aren't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I admit it," said Michael recklessly.</p>

  <p>"Did you speak the truth when you said that my uncle&mdash;" She stopped,
  at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>"No, I did not," replied Michael quietly. "Your uncle is dead, Miss
  Leamington."</p>

  <p>"Dead!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"He was murdered, in extraordinary circumstances."</p>

  <p>Suddenly her face went white.</p>

  <p>"He wasn't the man whose head was found at Esher?"</p>

  <p>"How did you know?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"It was in this morning's newspaper," she said, and inwardly he cursed the
  sleuth-hound of a reporter who had got on to the track of this latest
  tragedy.</p>

  <p>She had to know sooner or later: he satisfied himself with that
  thought.</p>

  <p>The return of Foss relieved him of further explanations. The man spoke for
  a while with Jack Knebworth in a low voice, and then the director beckoned
  Michael across.</p>

  <p>"Foss can't trace this manuscript." he said, handing back the sheet. "It
  may have been a sample page sent in by a contributor, or it may have been a
  legacy from our predecessors. I took over a whole lot of manuscript with the
  studio from a bankrupt production company."</p>

  <p>He looked impatiently at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Brixan, if it's possible I should be glad if you would excuse
  me. I've got some scenes to shoot ten miles away, with a leading lady from
  whose little head you've scared every idea that will be of the slightest
  value to me."</p>

  <p>Michael acted upon an impulse.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind my coming out with you to shoot&mdash;that means to
  photograph, doesn't it? I promise you I won't be in the way."</p>

  <p>Old Jack nodded curtly, and ten minutes later Michael Brixan was sitting
  side by side with the girl in a char-à-banc which was carrying them to the
  location. That he should be riding with the artistes at all was a tribute to
  his nerve rather than to his modesty.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap06"
     id="chap06">VI. THE MASTER OF GRIFF</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ADELE did not speak to him for a long time. Resentment that
  he should force his company upon her, and nervousness at the coming ordeal
  &mdash;a nervousness which became sheer panic as they drew nearer and nearer
  to their destination&mdash;made conversation impossible.</p>

  <p>"I see your Mr. Lawley Foss is with us," said Michael, glancing over his
  shoulder, and by way of making conversation.</p>

  <p>"He always goes on location," she said shortly. "A story has sometimes to
  be amended while it's being shot."</p>

  <p>"Where are we going now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Griff Towers first," she replied. She found it difficult to be uncivil to
  anybody. "It is a big place owned by Sir Gregory Penne."</p>

  <p>"But I thought we were going to the Dower House?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a little frown.</p>

  <p>"Why did you ask if you knew?" she demanded, almost in a tone of
  asperity.</p>

  <p>"Because I like to hear you speak," said the young man calmly. "Sir
  Gregory Penne? I seem to know the name."</p>

  <p>She did not answer.</p>

  <p>"He was in Borneo for many years, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"He's hateful," she said vehemently. "I detest him!" She did not explain
  the cause of her detestation, and Michael thought it discreet not to press
  the question, but presently she relieved him of responsibility.</p>

  <p>"I've been to his house twice. He has a very fine garden, which Mr.
  Knebworth has used before&mdash;of course, I only went as an extra and was
  very much in the background. I wish I had been more so. He has queer ideas
  about women, and especially actresses&mdash;not that I'm an actress," she
  added hastily, "but I mean people who play for a living. Thank heaven there's
  only one scene to be shot at Griff, and perhaps he will not be at home, but
  that's unlikely. He's always there when I go."</p>

  <p>Michael glanced at her out of the corner of his eye. His first impression
  of her beauty was more than confirmed. There was a certain wistfulness in her
  face which was very appealing; an honesty in the dark eyes that told him all
  he wanted to know about her attitude toward the admiration of the unknown Sir
  Gregory.</p>

  <p>"It's queer how all baronets are villains in stories," he said, "and
  queerer still that most of the baronets I've known have been men of singular
  morals. I'm bothering you, being here, aren't I?" he asked, dropping his tone
  of banter.</p>

  <p>She looked round at him.</p>

  <p>"You are a little," she said frankly. "You see, Mr. Brixan, this is my big
  chance. It's a chance that really never comes to an extra except in stories,
  and I'm frightened to death of what is going to happen. You make me nervous,
  but what makes me more panic-stricken is that the first scene is to be shot
  at Griff. I hate it! I hate it!" she said almost savagely. "That big,
  hard-looking house, with its hideous stuffed tigers and its awful-looking
  swords&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Swords?" he asked quickly. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"The walls are covered with them&mdash;Eastern swords. They make me shiver
  to see them. But Sir Gregory takes a delight in them. He told Mr. Knebworth,
  the last time we were there, that the swords were as sharp now as they were
  when they came from the hands of their makers, and some of them were three
  hundred years old. He's an extraordinary man: he can cut an apple in half on
  your hand and never so much as scratch you. That is one of his favourite
  stunts&mdash;do you know what 'stunt' means?"</p>

  <p>"I seem to have heard the expression," said Michael absently.</p>

  <p>"There is the house," she pointed. "Ugh! It makes me shiver."</p>

  <p>Griff Towers was one of those bleak-looking buildings that it had been the
  delight of the early Victorian architects to erect. Its one grey tower,
  placed on the left wing, gave it a lop-sided appearance, but even this
  distortion did not distract attention from its rectangular unloveliness. The
  place seemed all the more bare since the walls were innocent of greenery and
  it stood starkly in the midst of a yellow expanse of gravel.</p>

  <p>"Looks almost like a barracks," said Michael, "with a parade ground in
  front!"</p>

  <p>They passed through the lodge gates, and the char-à-banc stopped half-way
  up the drive. The gardens apparently were in the rear of the building, and
  certainly there was nothing that would attract the most careless of directors
  in its uninteresting façade.</p>

  <p>Michael got down from his seat and found Jack Knebworth already
  superintending the unloading of a camera and reflectors. Behind the
  char-a-banc came the big dynamo lorry, with three sun arcs that were to
  enhance the value of daylight.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're here, are you?" growled Jack. "Now you'll oblige me, Mr.
  Brixan, by not getting in the way. I've got a hard morning's work ahead of
  me."</p>

  <p>"I want you to take me on as a&mdash;what is the word?&mdash;extra," said
  Michael.</p>

  <p>The old man frowned at him.</p>

  <p>"Say, what's the great idea?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I have an excellent reason, and I promise you that nothing I do will in
  any way embarrass you. The truth is, Mr. Knebworth, I want to be around for
  the remainder of the day, and I need an excuse."</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth bit his lip, scratched his long chin, scowled, and
  then:</p>

  <p>"All right," he said gruffly. "Maybe you'll come in handy, though I'll
  have quite enough bother directing one amateur, and if you get into the
  pictures on this trip you're going to be lucky!"</p>

  <p>There was a man of the party, a tall young man whose hair was brushed back
  from his forehead, and was so tidy and well arranged that it seemed as if it
  had originally been stuck by glue and varnished over. A tall, somewhat
  good-looking boy, who had sat on Adele's left throughout the journey and had
  not spoken once. He raised his eyebrows at the appearance of Michael, and,
  strolling across to the harassed Knebworth, his hands in his pockets, he
  asked with a hurt air:</p>

  <p>"I say, Mr. Knebworth, who is this johnny?"</p>

  <p>"Which johnny?" growled old Jack. "You mean Brixan? He's an extra."</p>

  <p>"Oh, an extra, is he?" said the young man. "I say, it's pretty desperately
  awful when extras hobnob with principals! And this Leamington
  girl&mdash;she's simply going to mess up the pictures. She is, by Jove!"</p>

  <p>"Is she, by Jove?" snarled Knebworth. "Now see here, Mr. Connolly, I ain't
  so much in love with your work that I'm willing to admit in advance that even
  an extra is going to mess up this picture."</p>

  <p>"I've never played opposite to an extra in my life, dash it all!"</p>

  <p>"Then you must have felt lonely," grunted Jack, busy with his packing.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mendoza is an artiste&mdash;" began the youthful leading man, and
  Jack Knebworth straightened his back.</p>

  <p>"Get over there till you're wanted, you!" he roared. "When I need advice
  from pretty boys, I'll come to you&mdash;see? For the moment you're de trop,
  which is a French expression meaning that you're standing on ground there's a
  better use for."</p>

  <p>The disgruntled Reggie Connolly strolled away with a shrug of his thin
  shoulders, which indicated not only his conviction that the picture would
  fail, but that the responsibility was everywhere but under his hat.</p>

  <p>From the big doorway of Grill Towers, Sir Gregory Penne was watching the
  assembly of the company. He was a thick-set man, and the sun of Borneo and an
  unrestricted appetite had dyed his skin a colour which was between purple and
  brown. His face was covered with innumerable ridges, his eyes looked forth
  upon the world through two narrow slits. The rounded feminine chin seemed to
  be the only part of his face that sunshine and stronger stimulants had left
  in its natural condition.</p>

  <p>Michael watched him as he strolled down the slope to where they were
  standing, guessing his identity. He wore a golf suit of a loud check in which
  red predominated, and a big cap of the same material was pulled down over his
  eyes. Taking the stub of a cigar from his teeth, with a quick and
  characteristic gesture he wiped his scanty moustache on his knuckles.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Knebworth," he called.</p>

  <p>His voice was harsh and cruel: a voice that had never been mellowed by
  laughter or made soft by the tendernesses of humanity.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Sir Gregory."</p>

  <p>Old Knebworth disentangled himself from his company.</p>

  <p>"Sorry I'm late."</p>

  <p>"Don't apologize," said the other. "Only I thought you were going to shoot
  earlier. Brought my little girl, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Your little girl?" Jack looked at him, frankly nonplussed. "You mean
  Mendoza? No, she's not coming."</p>

  <p>"I don't mean Mendoza, if that's the dark girl. Never mind: I was only
  joking."</p>

  <p>Who the blazes was his little girl? thought Jack, who was ignorant of two
  unhappy experiences which an unconsidered extra girl had had on previous
  visits. The mystery, however, was soon cleared up, for the baronet walked
  slowly to where Adele Leamington was making a pretence of studying her
  script.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, little lady," he said, lifting his cap an eighth of an inch
  from his head.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Sir Gregory," she said coldly.</p>

  <p>"You didn't keep your promise." He shook his head waggishly. "Oh, woman,
  woman!"</p>

  <p>"I don't remember having made a promise," said the girl quietly. "You
  asked me to come to dinner with you, and I told you that that was
  impossible."</p>

  <p>"I promised to send my car for you. Don't say it was too far away. Never
  mind, never mind." And, to Michael's wrath, he squeezed the girl's arm in a
  manner which was intended to be paternal, but which filled the girl with
  indignant loathing.</p>

  <p>She wrenched her arm free, and, turning her back upon her tormentor,
  almost flew to Jack Knebworth with an incoherent demand for information on
  the reading of a line which was perfectly simple.</p>

  <p>Old Jack was no fool. He watched the play from under his eyelids,
  recognizing all the symptoms.</p>

  <p>"This is the last time we shall shoot at Griff Towers," he told
  himself.</p>

  <p>For Jack Knebworth was something of a stickler on behaviour, and had views
  on women which were diametrically opposite to those held by Sir Gregory
  Penne.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap07"
     id="chap07">VII. THE SWORDS AND BHAG</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE little party moved away, leaving Michael alone with the
  baronet. For a period, Gregory Penne watched the girl, his eyes glittering;
  then he became aware of Michael's presence and turned a cold, insolent stare
  upon the other.</p>

  <p>"What are you?" he asked, looking the detective up and down.</p>

  <p>"I'm an extra," said Michael.</p>

  <p>"An extra, eh? Sort of chorus boy? Put paint and powder on your face and
  all that sort of thing? What a life for a man!"</p>

  <p>"There are worse," said Michael, holding his antagonism in check.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that little girl&mdash;what's her name. Leamington?" asked
  the baronet suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I know her extremely well," said Michael untruthfully.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you do, eh?" said the master of Griff Towers with sudden amiability.
  "She's a nice little thing. Quite a cut above the ordinary chorus girl. You
  might bring her along to dinner one night. She'd come with you, eh?"</p>

  <p>The contortions of the puffy eyelids suggested to Michael that the man had
  winked. There was some thing about this gross figure that interested the
  scientist in Michael Brixan. He was elemental; an animal invested with a
  brain; and yet he must be something more than that if he had held a high
  administrative position under Government.</p>

  <p>"Are you acting? If you're not, you can come up and have a look at my
  swords," said the man suddenly.</p>

  <p>Michael guessed that, for a reason of his own, probably because of his
  claim to be Adele's friend, the man wished to cultivate the acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not acting," replied Michael.</p>

  <p>And no invitation could have given him greater pleasure. Did their owner
  realize the fact, Michael Brixan had already made up his mind not to leave
  Griff Towers until he had inspected that peculiar collection.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she's a nice little girl."</p>

  <p>Penne returned to the subject immediately as they paced up the slope
  toward the house.</p>

  <p>"As I say, a cut above chorus girls. Young, unsophisticated, virginal! You
  can have your sophisticated girls: there is no mystery to 'em! They revolt
  me. A girl should be like a spring flower. Give me the violet and the
  snowdrop: you can have a bushel of cabbage roses for one petal of the shy
  dears of the forest."</p>

  <p>Michael listened with a keen sense of nausea, and yet with an unusual
  interest, as the man rambled on. He said things which were sickening,
  monstrous. There were moments when Brixan found it difficult to keep his
  hands off the obscene figure that paced at his side; and only by adopting
  toward him the attitude with which the enthusiastic naturalist employs in his
  dealings with snakes was he able to get a grip of himself.</p>

  <p>The big entrance hall into which he was ushered was paved with earthen
  tiles, and, looking up at the stone walls, Michael had his first glimpse of
  the famous swords.</p>

  <p>There were hundreds of them&mdash;poniards, scimitars, ancient swords of
  Japan, basket-hilted hangers, two-handed swords that had felt the grip of
  long-dead Crusaders.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of 'em, eh?" Sir Gregory Penne spoke with the pride of
  an enthusiastic collector. "There isn't one of them that could be duplicated,
  my boy; and they're only the rag, tag and bobtail of my collection."</p>

  <p>He led his visitor along a broad corridor, lighted by square windows set
  at intervals, and here again the walls were covered with shining weapons.
  Throwing open a door, Sir Gregory ushered the other into a large room which
  was evidently his library, though the books were few, and, so far as Michael
  could see at first glance, the conventional volumes that are to be found in
  the houses of the country gentry.</p>

  <p>Over the mantelshelf were two great swords of a pattern which Michael did
  not remember having seen before.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of those?"</p>

  <p>Penne lifted one from the silver hook which supported it, and drew it from
  its scabbard.</p>

  <p>"Don't feel the edge unless you want to cut yourself. This would split a
  hair, but it would also cut you in two, and you would never know what had
  happened till you fell apart!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly his manner changed, and he almost snatched the sword from
  Michael's hand, and, putting it back in its sheath, he hung it up.</p>

  <p>"That is a Sumatran sword, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It comes from Borneo," said the baronet shortly.</p>

  <p>"The home of the head-hunters."</p>

  <p>Sir Gregory looked round, his brows lowered.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "it comes from Dutch Borneo."</p>

  <p>Evidently there was something about this weapon which aroused unpleasant
  memories. He glowered for a long time in silence into the little fire that
  was burning on the hearth.</p>

  <p>"I killed the man who owned that," he said at last, and it struck Michael
  that he was speaking more to himself than to his visitor. "At least, I hope I
  killed him. I hope so!"</p>

  <p>He glanced round, and Michael Brixan could have sworn there was
  apprehension in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, What's-your-name," he commanded, pointing to a low settee.
  "We'll have a drink."</p>

  <p>He pushed a bell, and, to Michael's astonishment, the summons was answered
  by an undersized native, a little copper-coloured man, naked to the waist.
  Gregory gave an order in a language which was unintelligible to
  Michael&mdash;he guessed, by its sibilants, it was Malayan&mdash;and the
  servant, with a quick salaam, disappeared, and came back almost instantly
  with a tray containing a large decanter and two thin glasses.</p>

  <p>"I have no white servants&mdash;can't stand 'em," said Penne, taking the
  contents of his glass at a gulp. "I like servants who don't steal and don't
  gossip. You can lick 'em if they misbehave, and there's no trouble. I got
  this fellow last year in Sumatra, and he's the best butler I've had."</p>

  <p>"Do you go to Borneo every year?" asked Michael.</p>

  <p>"I go almost every year," said the other. "I've got a yacht: she's lying
  at Southampton now. If I didn't get out of this cursed country once a year
  I'd go mad. There's nothing here, nothing! Have you ever met that dithering
  old fool Longvale? Knebworth said you were going on to him &mdash;pompous old
  ass, who lives in the past and dresses like an advertisement for somebody's
  whisky. Have another?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't finished this yet," said Michael with a smile, and his eyes
  went up to the sword above the mantelpiece. "Have you had that very long? It
  looks modern."</p>

  <p>"It isn't," snapped the other. "Modern! It's three hundred years old if
  it's a day, I've only had it a year." Again he changed the subject abruptly.
  "I like you, What's-your-name. I like people or I dislike them instantly.
  You're the sort of fellow who'd do well in the East. I've made two millions
  there. The East is full of wonder, full of unbelievable things." He screwed
  his head round and fixed Michael with a glittering eye. "Full of good
  servants," he said slowly. "Would you like to meet the perfect servant?"</p>

  <p>There was something peculiar in his tone, and Michael nodded.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to see the slave who never asks questions and never
  disobeys, who has no love but love of me"&mdash;he thumped himself on the
  chest&mdash;"no hate but for the people I hate&mdash;my trusty
  &mdash;Bhag?"</p>

  <p>He rose, and, crossing to his table, turned a little switch that Michael
  had noticed attached to the side of the desk. As he did so, a part of the
  panelled wall at the farther end of the room swung open. For a second Michael
  saw nothing, and then there emerged, blinking into the daylight, a most
  sinister, a most terrifying figure. And Michael Brixan had need for all his
  self-control to check the exclamation that rose to his lips.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap08"
     id="chap08">VIII. BHAG</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a great orang-outang. Crouched as it was, gazing
  malignantly upon the visitor with its bead-like eyes, it stood over six feet
  in height. The hairy chest was enormous; the arms that almost touched the
  floor were as thick as an average man's thigh. It wore a pair of workman's
  dark-blue overalls, held in place by two straps that crossed the broad
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Bhag." called Sir Gregory in a voice so soft that Michael could not
  believe it was the man's own, "come here."</p>

  <p>The gigantic figure waddled across the room to where they stood before the
  fireplace.</p>

  <p>"This is a friend of mine, Bhag."</p>

  <p>The great ape held out his hand, and for a second Michael's was held in
  its velvet palm. This done, he lifted his paw to his nose and sniffed loudly,
  the only sound he made.</p>

  <p>"Get me some cigars," said Penne.</p>

  <p>Immediately the ape walked to a cabinet, pulled open a drawer, and brought
  out a box.</p>

  <p>"Not those," said Gregory. "The small ones."</p>

  <p>He spoke distinctly, as if he were articulating to somebody who was deaf,
  and, without a moment's hesitation, the hideous Bhag replaced the box and
  brought out another.</p>

  <p>"Pour me out a whisky-and-soda."</p>

  <p>The ape obeyed. He did not spill a drop, and when his owner said "Enough",
  replaced the stopper in the decanter and put it back.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, that will do, Bhag."</p>

  <p>Without a sound the ape waddled back to the open panelling and
  disappeared, and the door closed behind him.</p>

  <p>"Why, the thing is human!" said Michael in an awe-stricken whisper.</p>

  <p>Sir Gregory Penne chuckled.</p>

  <p>"More than human," he said. "Bhag is my shield against all trouble."</p>

  <p>His eyes seemed to go instantly to the sword above the mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"Where does he live?"</p>

  <p>"He's got a little apartment of his own, and he keeps it clean. He feeds
  with the servants."</p>

  <p>"Good lord!" gasped Michael, and the other chuckled again at the surprise
  he had aroused.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he feeds with the servants. They're afraid of him, but they worship
  him: he's a sort of god to them, but they're afraid of him. Do you know what
  would have happened if I'd said, 'This man is my enemy'?" He pointed his
  stubby finger at Michael's chest. "He would have torn you limb from limb. You
  wouldn't have had a chance, Mr. What's-your-name, not a dog's chance. And yet
  he can be gentle&mdash;yes, he can be gentle." He nodded. "And cunning! He
  goes out almost every night, and I've had no complaints from the villagers.
  No sheep stolen, nobody frightened. He just goes out and loafs around in the
  woods, and doesn't kill as much as a hen partridge."</p>

  <p>"How long have you had him?"</p>

  <p>"Eight or nine years," said the baronet carelessly, swallowing the whisky
  that the ape had poured for him. "Now let's go out and see the actors and
  actresses. She's a nice girl, eh? You're not forgetting you're going to bring
  her to dinner, are you? What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"Brixan," said Michael. "Michael Brixan."</p>

  <p>Sir Gregory grunted something.</p>

  <p>"I'll remember that&mdash;Brixan. I ought to have told Bhag. He likes to
  know."</p>

  <p>"Would he have known me again, suppose you had?" asked Michael,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"Known you?" said the baronet contemptuously. "He will not only know you,
  but he'll be able to trail you down. Notice him smelling his hand? He was
  filing you for reference, my boy. If I told him, 'Go along and take this
  message to Brixan', he'd find you."</p>

  <p>When they reached the lovely gardens at the back of the house the first
  scene had been shot, and there was a smile on Jack Knebworth's face which
  suggested that Adele's misgivings had not been justified. And so it
  proved.</p>

  <p>"That girl's a peach," Jack unbent to say. "A natural-born actress, built
  for this scene&mdash;it's almost too good to be true. What do you want?"</p>

  <p>It was Mr. Reggie Connolly, and he had the obsession which is perpetual in
  every leading man. He felt that sufficient opportunities had not been offered
  to him.</p>

  <p>"I say, Mr. Knebworth," he said in a grieved tone, "I'm not getting much
  of the fat in this story! So far, there's about thirty feet of me in this
  picture. I say, that's not right, you know! If a johnny is being
  featured&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're not being featured," said Jack shortly, "And Mendoza's chief
  complaint was that there was too much of you in it."</p>

  <p>Michael looked round. Sir Gregory Penne had strolled toward where the girl
  was standing, and, in her state of elation, she had no room in her heart even
  for resentment against the man she so cordially detested.</p>

  <p>"Little girl, I want to speak to you before you go," he said, dropping his
  voice, and for once she smiled at him.</p>

  <p>"Well, you have a good opportunity now, Sir Gregory," she said.</p>

  <p>"I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened the other day, and I
  respect you for what you said, for a girl's entitled to keep her kisses for
  men she likes. Aren't I right?"</p>

  <p>"Of course you're right," she said. "Please don't think any more about it,
  Sir Gregory."</p>

  <p>"I'd no right to kiss you against your will, especially when you're in my
  house. Are you going to forgive me?"</p>

  <p>"I do forgive you," she said, and would have left him, but he caught her
  arm.</p>

  <p>"You're coming to dinner, aren't you?" He jerked his head toward the
  watchful Michael. "Your friend said he'd bring you along."</p>

  <p>"Which friend?" she asked, her eyebrows raised. "You mean Mr. Brixan?"</p>

  <p>"That's the fellow. Why do you make friends with that kind of man? Not
  that he isn't a decent fellow. I like him personally. Will you come along to
  dinner?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't," she said, her old aversion gaining ground.</p>

  <p>"Little girl," he said earnestly, "there's nothing you couldn't have from
  me. Why do you want to trouble your pretty head about this cheap play-acting?
  I'll give you a company of your own if you want it, and the best car that
  money can buy."</p>

  <p>His eyes were like points of fire, and she shivered.</p>

  <p>"I have all I want, Sir Gregory," she said.</p>

  <p>She was furious with Michael Brixan. How dared he presume to accept an
  invitation on her behalf? How dare he call himself her friend? Her anger
  almost smothered her dislike for her persecutor.</p>

  <p>"You come over tonight&mdash;let him bring you," said Penne huskily. "I
  want you tonight&mdash;do you hear? You're staying at old Longvale's. You can
  easily slip out."</p>

  <p>"I'll do nothing of the kind. I don't think you know what you're asking,
  Sir Gregory," she said quietly. "Whatever you mean, it is an insult to
  me."</p>

  <p>Turning abruptly, she left him. Michael would have spoken to her, but she
  passed, her head in the air, a look on her face which dismayed him, though,
  after a moment's consideration, he could guess the cause.</p>

  <p>When the various apparatus was packed, and the company had taken their
  seats in the char-à-banc, Michael observed that she had very carefully placed
  herself between Jack Knebworth and the sulking leading man, and wisely
  himself chose a seat some distance from her.</p>

  <p>The car was about to start when Sir Gregory came up to him, and, stepping
  on the running-board:</p>

  <p>"You said you'd get her over&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"If I said that," said Michael, "I must have been drunk, and it takes more
  than one glass of whisky to reduce me to that disgusting condition. Miss
  Leamington is a free agent, and she would be singularly ill-advised to dine
  alone with you or any other man."</p>

  <p>He expected an angry outburst, but, to his surprise, the squat man only
  laughed and waved him a pleasant farewell. Looking round as the car turned
  from the lodge gates, Michael saw him standing on the lawn, talking to a man,
  and recognized Foss, who, for some reason, had stayed behind.</p>

  <p>And then his eyes strayed past the two men to the window of the library,
  where the monstrous Bhag sat in his darkened room, waiting for instructions
  which he would carry into effect without reason or pity. Michael Brixan,
  hardened as he was to danger of every variety, found himself shuddering.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap09"
     id="chap09">IX. THE ANCESTOR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Dower House was away from the main road. A sprawling
  mass of low buildings, it stood behind untidy hedges and crumbling walls.
  Once the place had enjoyed the services of a lodge-keeper, but the tiny lodge
  was deserted, the windows broken, and there were gaps in the tiled roof. The
  gates had not been closed for generations; they were broken, and leant
  crazily against the walls to which they had been thrust by the last person
  who had employed them to guard the entrance to the Dower House.</p>

  <p>What had once been a fair lawn was now a tangle of weeds. Thistle and
  mayweed grew knee-deep where the gallants of old had played their bowls; and
  it was clear to Michael, from his one glance, that only a portion of the
  house was used. In only one of the wings were the windows whole; the others
  were broken or so grimed with dirt that they appeared to have been
  painted.</p>

  <p>His amusement blended with curiosity, Michael saw for the first time the
  picturesque Mr. Sampson Longvale. He came out to meet them, his bald head
  glistening in the afternoon sunlight, his strapped fawn-coloured trousers,
  velvet waistcoat and old-fashioned stock completely supporting Gregory
  Penne's description of him.</p>

  <p>"Delighted to see you, Mr. Knebworth. I've a very poor house, but I offer
  you a very rich welcome! I have had tea served in my little dining-room. Will
  you please introduce me to the members of your company?"</p>

  <p>The courtesy, the old-world spirit of dignity, were very charming, and
  Michael felt a warm glow toward this fine old man who brought to this modern
  atmosphere the love and the fragrance of a past age.</p>

  <p>"I should like to shoot a scene before we lose the light, Mr. Longvale,"
  said Knebworth, "so, if you don't mind the meal being a scrambling one, I can
  give the company a quarter of an hour." He looked round. "Where is Foss?" he
  asked. "I want to change a scene."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Foss said he was walking from Griff Towers," said one of the company.
  "He stopped behind to speak to Sir Gregory."</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth cursed his dilatory scenario-man with vigour and
  originality.</p>

  <p>"I hope he hasn't stopped to borrow money," he said savagely. "That
  fellow's going to ruin my credit if I'm not careful."</p>

  <p>He had overcome his objection to his new extra; possibly he felt that
  there was nobody else in the party whom he could take into his confidence
  without hurt to discipline.</p>

  <p>"Is he that way inclined?"</p>

  <p>"He's always short of money and always trying to make it by some fool
  trick which leaves him shorter than he was before. When a man gets that kind
  of bug in his head he's only a block away from prison. Are you going to stay
  the night? I don't think you'll be able to sleep here," he said, changing the
  subject, "but I suppose you'll be going back to London?"</p>

  <p>"Not tonight," said Michael quickly. "Don't worry about me. I particularly
  do not wish to give you any trouble."</p>

  <p>"Come and meet the old man," said Knebworth under his breath. "He's a
  queer old devil with the heart of a child."</p>

  <p>"I like what I've seen of him," said Michael.</p>

  <p>Mr. Longvale accepted the introduction all over again.</p>

  <p>"I fear there will not be sufficient room in my dining-room for the whole
  Company. I have had a little table laid in my study. Perhaps you and your
  friends would like to have your tea there?"</p>

  <p>"Why, that's very kind of you, Mr. Longvale. You have met Mr. Brixan?"</p>

  <p>The old man smiled and nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have met him without realizing that I've met him. I never remember
  names&mdash;a curious failing which was shared by my great-great-uncle
  Charles, with the result that he fell into extraordinary confusion when he
  wrote his memoirs, and in consequence many of the incidents he relates have
  been regarded as apocryphal."</p>

  <p>He showed them into a narrow room that ran from the front to the back of
  the house. Its ceilings were supported by black rafters: the open
  wainscoting, polished and worn by generations of hands, must have been at
  least five hundred years old. There were no swords over this mantelpiece,
  thought Michael with an inward smile. Instead, there was a portrait of a
  handsome old gentleman, the dignity of whose face was arresting. There was
  only one word with an adequate description: it was majestic.</p>

  <p>He made no comment on the picture, nor did the old man speak of it till
  later. The meal was hastily disposed of, and, sitting on the wall, Michael
  watched the last daylight scene shot, and was struck by the plastic genius of
  the girl. He knew enough of motion pictures and their construction to realize
  what it meant to the director to have in his hands one who could so
  faithfully reproduce the movements and the emotions which the old man
  dictated.</p>

  <p>In other circumstances he might have thought it grotesque to see Jack
  Knebworth pretending to be a young girl, resting his elderly cheek coyly upon
  the back of his clasped hand, and walking with mincing steps from one side of
  the picture to the other. But he knew that the American was a mason who was
  cutting roughly the shape of the sculpture and leaving it to the finer
  artiste to express in her personality the delicate contours that would
  delight the eye of the picture-loving world. She was no longer Adele
  Leamington: she was Roselle, the heiress to an estate of which her wicked
  cousin was trying to deprive her. The story itself he recognized: a
  half-and-half plagiarism of "The Cat and the Canary", with which were blended
  certain situations from "The Miracle Man". He mentioned this fact when the
  scene was finished.</p>

  <p>"I guess it's a steal," said Jack Knebworth philosophically, "and I didn't
  inquire too closely into it. It's Foss's story, and I should be pained to
  discover there was anything original in it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Foss had made a tardy reappearance, and Michael found himself
  wondering what was the nature of that confidential interview which the writer
  had had with Sir Gregory.</p>

  <p>Going back to the long sitting-room, he stood watching the daylight fade
  and speculating upon the one mystery within a mystery&mdash;the extraordinary
  effect which Adele had produced upon him.</p>

  <p>Mike Brixan had known many beautiful women&mdash;women in every class of
  society. He had known the best and the worst, he had gaoled a few, and had
  watched one face a French firing-squad one grey wintry morning at Vincennes.
  He had liked many, nearly loved one, and it seemed, cold-bloodedly analysing
  his emotions, that he was in danger of actually loving a girl whom he had
  never met before that morning.</p>

  <p>"Which is absurd," he said aloud.</p>

  <p>"What is absurd?" asked Knebworth, who had come into the room
  unnoticed.</p>

  <p>"I also wondered what you were thinking," smiled old Mr. Longvale, who had
  been watching the young man in silence.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;well, I was thinking of the portrait." Michael turned
  and indicated the picture above the fireplace, and in a sense he spoke the
  truth, for the thread of that thought had run through all others. "The face
  seemed familiar," he said, "which is absurd, because it is obviously an old
  painting."</p>

  <p>Mr. Longvale lit two candles and carried one to the portrait. Again
  Michael looked, and again the majesty of the face impressed him.</p>

  <p>"That is my great-great-uncle, Charles Henry," said old Mr. Longvale with
  pride; "or, as we call him affectionately in our family, the Great
  Monsieur."</p>

  <p>Michael's face was half turned toward the window as the old man spoke...
  Suddenly the room seemed to spin before his eyes. Jack Knebworth saw his face
  go white and caught him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Michael unsteadily.</p>

  <p>Knebworth was staring past him at the window.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" he said.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the illumination from the two candles and the faint
  dusk light that came from the garden, the room was in darkness.</p>

  <p>"Did you see it?" he asked, and ran to the window, staring out.</p>

  <p>"What was it?" asked old Mr. Longvale, joining him.</p>

  <p>"I could have sworn I saw a head in the window. Did you see it,
  Brixan?"</p>

  <p>"I saw something," said Michael unsteadily. "Do you mind if I go out into
  the garden?"</p>

  <p>"I hoped you saw it. It looked like a monkey's head to me."</p>

  <p>Michael nodded. He walked down the flagged passage into the garden, and,
  as he did so, slipped a Browning from his hip, pressed down the safety-catch,
  and dropped the pistol into his jacket pocket.</p>

  <p>He disappeared, and five minutes later Knebworth saw him pacing the garden
  path, and went out to him.</p>

  <p>"Did you see anything?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing in the garden. You must have been mistaken."</p>

  <p>"But didn't you see him?"</p>

  <p>Michael hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I thought I saw something," he said with an assumption of carelessness.
  "When are you going to shoot those night pictures of yours?"</p>

  <p>"You saw something, Brixan&mdash;was it a face?"</p>

  <p>Mike Brixan nodded.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">X. THE OPEN WINDOW</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE dynamo Wagon was humming as he walked down the garden
  path, and with a hiss and a splutter from the arcs, the front of the cottage
  was suddenly illuminated by their fierce light. Outside on the road a
  motorist had pulled up to look upon the unusual spectacle.</p>

  <p>"What is happening?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"They're taking a picture," said Michael.</p>

  <p>"Oh, is that what it is? I suppose it is one of Knebworth's outfits?"</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" demanded Michael suddenly. "Forgive my asking you,
  but if you're heading for Chichester you can render me a very great service
  if you give me a lift."</p>

  <p>"Jump in," said the man. "I'm going to Petworth, but it will not be much
  out of my way to take you into the city."</p>

  <p>Until they came to the town he plied Michael with questions betraying that
  universal inquisitiveness which picture-making invariably incites amongst the
  uninitiated.</p>

  <p>Michael got down near the market-place and made his way to the house of a
  man he knew, a former master at his old school, now settled down in
  Chichester, who had, amongst other possessions, an excellent library.
  Declining his host's pressing invitation to dinner, Michael stated his needs,
  and the old master laughed.</p>

  <p>"I can't remember that you were much of a student in my days, Michael," he
  said, "but you may have the run of the library. Is it some line of Virgil
  that escapes you? I may be able to save you a hunt."</p>

  <p>"It's not Virgil, maestro," smiled Michael. "Some thing infinitely more
  full-blooded!"</p>

  <p>He was in the library for twenty minutes, and when he emerged there was a
  light of triumph in his eye.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to use your telephone, if I may," he said, and he got London
  without delay.</p>

  <p>For ten minutes he was speaking with Scotland Yard, and, when he had
  finished, he went into the dining-room, where the master, who was a bachelor,
  was eating his solitary dinner.</p>

  <p>"You can render me one more service, mentor of my youth," he said. "Have
  you in this abode of peace an automatic pistol that throws a heavier shell
  than this?" and he put his own on the table.</p>

  <p>Michael knew Mr. Scott had been an officer of the Territorial Army, and
  incidentally an instructor of the Officers' Training Corps, so that his
  request was not as impossible of fulfilment as it appeared.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can give you a heavier one than that. What are you shooting
  &mdash;elephants?"</p>

  <p>"Something a trifle more dangerous," said Michael.</p>

  <p>"Curiosity was never a weakness of mine," said the master, and went out to
  return with a Browning of heavy calibre and a box of cartridges.</p>

  <p>They spent five minutes cleaning the pistol, which had not been in use for
  some time, and, with his new weapon weighing down his jacket pocket, Mike
  took his leave, carrying a lighter heart and a clearer understanding than he
  had enjoyed when he had arrived at the house.</p>

  <p>He hired a car from a local garage and drove back to the Dower House,
  dismissing the car just short of his destination. Jack Knebworth had not even
  noticed that he had disappeared. But old Mr. Longvale, wearing a coat with
  many capes, and a soft silk cap from which dangled a long tassel, came to him
  almost as soon as he entered the garden.</p>

  <p>"May I speak to you, Mr. Brixan?" he said in a low voice, and they went
  into the house together. "Do you remember Mr. Knebworth was very perturbed
  because he thought he saw somebody peering in at the window &mdash;something
  with a monkey's head?"</p>

  <p>Michael nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, it is a most curious fact," said the old gentleman impressively,
  "that a quarter of an hour ago I happened to be walking in the far end of my
  garden, and, looking across the hedge toward the field, I suddenly saw a
  gigantic form rise, apparently from the ground, and move toward these
  bushes"&mdash;he pointed through the window to a clump in a field on the
  opposite side of the road. "He seemed to be crouching forward and moving
  furtively."</p>

  <p>"Will you show me the place?" said Michael quickly. He followed the other
  across the road to the bushes, a little dump which was empty when they
  reached it. Kneeling down to make a new skyline, Michael scanned the limited
  horizon, but there was no sign of Bhag. For that it was Bhag he had no doubt.
  There might be nothing in it. Penne told him that the animal was in the habit
  of taking nightly strolls, and that he was perfectly harmless. Suppose...</p>

  <p>The thought was absurd, fantastically absurd. And yet the animal had been
  so extraordinarily human that no speculation in connection with it was quite
  absurd.</p>

  <p>When he returned to the garden, he went in search of the girl. She had
  finished her scene and was watching the stealthy movements of two screen
  burglars, who were creeping along the wall in the subdued light of the
  arcs.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Miss Leamington, I'm going to ask you an impertinent question.
  Have you brought a complete change of clothes with you?"</p>

  <p>"Why ever do you ask that?" she demanded, her eyes wide open. "Of course I
  did! I always bring a complete change in case the weather breaks."</p>

  <p>"That's one question. Did you lose anything when you were at Griff
  Towers?"</p>

  <p>"I lost my gloves," she said quickly. "Did you find them?"</p>

  <p>"No. When did you miss them?"</p>

  <p>"I missed them immediately. I thought for a moment&mdash;" She stopped.
  "It was a foolish idea."</p>

  <p>"What did you think?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather not tell you. It is a purely personal matter."</p>

  <p>"You thought that Sir Gregory had taken them as a souvenir?"</p>

  <p>Even in the half-darkness he saw her colour come and go.</p>

  <p>"I did think that," she said, a little stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Then it doesn't matter very much&mdash;about your change of clothing," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Whatever are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him suspiciously. He guessed she thought that he had been
  drinking, but the last thing in the world he wanted to do at that moment was
  to explain his somewhat disjointed questions.</p>

  <p>"Now everybody is going to bed!"</p>

  <p>It was old Jack Knebworth talking.</p>

  <p>"Everybody! Off you go! Mr. Foss has shown you your rooms. I want you up
  at four o'clock to-morrow morning, so get as much sleep as you can. Foss,
  you've marked the rooms?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the man. "I've put the names on every door. I've given this
  young lady a room to herself&mdash;is that right?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is," said Knebworth dubiously, "Anyway, she won't be there
  long enough to get used to it."</p>

  <p>The girl said good night to the detective and went straight up to her
  apartment. It was a tiny room, smelling somewhat musty, and was simply
  furnished. A truckle bed, a chest of drawers with a swinging glass on top,
  and a small table and chair was all that the apartment contained. By the
  light of her candle the floor showed signs of having been recently scrubbed,
  and the centre was covered by a threadbare square of carpet.</p>

  <p>She locked the door, blew out the candle, and, undressing in the dark,
  went to the window and threw open the casement. And then, for the first time,
  she saw, on the centre of one of the small panes, a circular disc of paper.
  It was pasted on the outside of the window, and at first she was about to
  pull it off when she guessed that it might be some indicator placed by
  Knebworth to mark an exact position that he required for the morning
  picture-taking.</p>

  <p>She did not immediately fall asleep, her mind, for some curious reason,
  being occupied unprofitably with a tumultuous sense of annoyance directed
  toward Michael Brixan. For a long time a strong sense of justice fought with
  a sense of humour equally powerful. He was a nice man, she told herself; the
  sixth sense of woman had already delivered that information, heavily
  underlined. He certainly had nerve. In the end humour brought sleep. She was
  smiling when her eyelids closed.</p>

  <p>She had been sleeping two hours, though it did not seem two seconds. A
  sense of impending danger wakened her, and she sat up in bed, her heart
  thumping wildly. She looked round the room. In the pale moon light she could
  see almost every corner, and it was empty. Was it somebody outside the door
  that had wakened her? She tried the door-handle: it was locked, as she had
  left it. The window? It was very near to the ground, she remembered. Stepping
  to the window, she pulled one casement close. She was closing the other when,
  out of the darkness below, reached a great hairy arm and a hand closed like a
  vice on her wrist.</p>

  <p>She did not scream. She stood breathless, dying of terror, she felt. Her
  heart ceased beating, and she was conscious of a deadly cold. What was it?
  What could it be? Summoning up her courage, she looked out of the window down
  into a hideous, bestial face and two round green eyes that stared into
  hers.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">XI. THE MARK ON THE WINDOW</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE thing was twittering at her, soft, bird-like noises, and
  she saw the flash of its white teeth in the darkness. It was not pulling, it
  was simply holding, one hand gripping the tendrils of the ivy up which it had
  climbed, the other hand firmly about her wrist. Again it twittered and
  pulled. She drew back, but she might as well have tried to draw back from a
  moving piston-rod. A great, hairy leg was suddenly flung over the sill; the
  second hand came up and covered her face.</p>

  <p>The sound of her scream was deadened in the hairy paw, but somebody heard
  it. From the ground below tame a flash of fire and the deafening "tang!" of a
  pistol exploding. A bullet zipped and crashed amongst the ivy, striking the
  brickwork, and she heard the whirr of the ricochet. Instantly the great
  monkey released his hold and dropped down out of sight. Half swooning, she
  dropped upon the window-sill, incapable of movement. And then the saw a
  figure come out of the shadow of the laurel bush, and instantly recognized
  the midnight prowler. It was Michael Brixan.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt?" he asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>She could only shake her head, for speech was denied her.</p>

  <p>"I didn't hit him, did I?"</p>

  <p>With an effort she found a husk of a voice in her dry throat. "No, I don't
  think so. He dropped."</p>

  <p>Michael had pulled an electric torch from his pocket and was searching the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"No sign of blood. He was rather difficult to hit&mdash;I was afraid of
  hurting you, too."</p>

  <p>A window had been thrown up and Jack Knebworth's voice bawled into the
  night: "What's the shooting? Is that you, Brixan?"</p>

  <p>"It is I. Come down, and I'll tell you all about it."</p>

  <p>The noise did not seem to have aroused Mr. Longvale, or, for the matter of
  that, any other member of the party; and when Knebworth reached the garden he
  found no other audience than Mike Brixan.</p>

  <p>In a few words Michael told him what he had seen.</p>

  <p>"The monkey belongs to friend Penne," he said. "I saw it this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"What do you think&mdash;that he was prowling round and saw the open
  window?"</p>

  <p>Michael shook his head. "No," he said quietly, "he came with one intention
  and purpose, which was to carry off your leading lady. That sounds highly
  dramatic and improbable, but that is the opinion I have formed. This ape, I
  tell you, is nearly human."</p>

  <p>"But he wouldn't know the girl. He has never seen her."</p>

  <p>"He could smell her," said Mike instantly. "She lost a pair of gloves at
  the Towers today, and it's any odds that they were stolen by the noble
  Gregory Penne, so that he might introduce to Bhag an unfailing scent."</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it; it is incredible! Though I'll admit," said Jack
  Knebworth thoughtfully, "that these big apes do some amazing things. Did you
  shoot him?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I didn't shoot him, but I can tell you this, that he's an animal
  that's been gunned before, or he'd have come for me, in which case he would
  have been now fairly dead."</p>

  <p>"What were you doing round here, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"Just watching out," said the other carelessly. "The earnest detective has
  so many things on his conscience that he can't sleep like ordinary people.
  Speaking for myself, I never intended leaving the garden, because I expected
  Brer Bhag. Who is that?"</p>

  <p>The door opened, and a slim figure, wrapped in a dressing-gown, came out
  into the open.</p>

  <p>"Young lady, you're going to catch a very fine cold," warned Knebworth.
  "What happened to you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know." She was feeling her wrist tenderly. "I heard something and
  went to the window, and then this horrible thing caught hold of me. What was
  it, Mr. Brixan?"</p>

  <p>"It was nothing more alarming than a monkey," said he with affected
  unconcern. "I'm sorry you were so scared. I guess the shooting worried you
  more?"</p>

  <p>"You don't guess anything of the kind. You know it didn't! Oh, it was
  horrible, horrible!" She covered her face with her trembling hands.</p>

  <p>Old Jack grunted.</p>

  <p>"I think she's right, too. You owe something to our friend here, young
  lady. Apparently he was expecting this visit and watched in the garden."</p>

  <p>"You expected it?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Knebworth has made rather more of the part I played than can be
  justified," said Mike. "And if you think that this is a hero's natural
  modesty, you're mistaken. I did expect this gentleman, because he'd been seen
  in the fields by Mr. Longvale. And you thought you saw him yourself, didn't
  you, Knebworth?"</p>

  <p>Jack nodded.</p>

  <p>"In fact, we all saw him," Mike went on, "and as I didn't like the idea of
  a coming star (if I may express that pious hope) being subjected to the
  annoyance of visiting monkeys, I sat up in the garden."</p>

  <p>With a sudden impulsive gesture she put out her little hand, and Michael
  took it.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mr. Brixan," she said. "I have been wrong about you."</p>

  <p>"Who isn't?" asked Mike with an extravagant shrug.</p>

  <p>She returned to her room, and this time she closed her window. Once,
  before she went finally to sleep, she rose and, peeping through the curtains,
  saw the little glowing point of the watcher's cigar, and went back to bed
  comforted, to sleep if it were only for a few minutes before Foss began
  knocking on the doors to waken the company.</p>

  <p>The literary man himself was the first down. The garden was beginning to
  show palely in the dawn light, and he bade Michael Brixan a gruff good
  morning.</p>

  <p>"Good morning to you," said Michael. "By the way, Mr. Foss, you stayed
  behind at Griff Towers yesterday to see our friend Penne?"</p>

  <p>"That's no business of yours," growled the man, and would have passed on,
  but Michael stood squarely in his path.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing which is a business of mine, and that is to ask you
  why that little white disc appears on Miss Leamington's window?"</p>

  <p>He pointed up to the white circle that the girl had seen the night
  before.</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about it," said Foss with rising anger, but there
  was also a note of fear in his voice.</p>

  <p>"If you don't know, who will? Because I saw you put it there, just before
  it got dark last night."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you must know," said the man, "it was to mark a vision boundary
  for the camera-man."</p>

  <p>That sounded a plausible excuse. Michael had seen Jack Knebworth marking
  out boundaries in the garden to ensure the actors being in the picture. At
  the first opportunity, when Knebworth appeared he questioned him on the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"No, I gave no instructions to put up marks. Where is it?"</p>

  <p>Michael showed him.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't have a mark up there, anyway, should I? Right in the middle of
  a window! What do you make of it?"</p>

  <p>"I think Foss put it there with one object. The window was marked at
  Gregory's request."</p>

  <p>"But why?" asked Knebworth, staring.</p>

  <p>"To show Bhag Adele Leamington's room. That's why," said Michael, and he
  was confident that his view was an accurate one.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12">XII. A CRY FROM A TOWER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MICHAEL did not wait to see the early-morning scenes shot.
  He had decided upon a course of action, and as soon as he conveniently could
  he made his escape from the Dower House, and, crossing a field, reached the
  road which led to Griff Towers. Possessing a good eye for country, he had
  duly noted the field-path which ran along the boundary of Sir Gregory Penne's
  estate, and was, he guessed, a short cut to Griff; and ten minutes' walk
  brought him to the stile where the path joined the road. He walked quickly,
  his eyes on the ground, looking for some trace of the beast; but there had
  been no rain, and, unless he had wounded the animal, there was little hope
  that he would pick up the track.</p>

  <p>Presently he came to the high flint wall which marked the southern end of
  the baronet's grounds, and this he followed until he came to a postern let in
  the wall, a door that appeared to have been recently in use, for it was ajar,
  he noted with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Pushing it open, he found himself in a large field which evidently served
  as kitchen garden for the house. There was nobody in sight. The grey tower
  looked even more forbidding and ugly in the early-morning light. No smoke
  came from the chimneys. Griff was a house of the dead. Nevertheless, he
  proceeded cautiously, and, instead of crossing the field, moved back into the
  shadow of the wall until he reached the high boxwood fence that ran at right
  angles and separated the kitchen garden from that beautiful pleasance which
  Jack Knebworth had used the previous morning as a background for his
  scenes.</p>

  <p>And all the time he kept his eyes roving, expecting at any moment to see
  the hideous figure of Bhag appear from the ground. At last he reached the end
  of the hedge. He was now within a few paces of the gravelled front, and less
  than half a dozen yards from the high, square grey tower which gave the house
  its name.</p>

  <p>From where he stood he could see the whole front of the house. The drawn
  white blinds, the general lifelessness of Griff, might have convinced a less
  sceptical man than Mike Brixan that his suspicions were unfounded.</p>

  <p>He was hesitating as to whether he should go to the house or not when he
  heard a crash of glass, and looked up in time to see fragments falling from
  the topmost room of the tower. The sun had not yet risen, the earth was still
  wrapped in the illusory dawn light, and the hedge made an admirable
  hiding-place.</p>

  <p>Who was breaking windows at this hour of the morning? Surely not the
  careful Bhag&mdash;so far he had reached in his speculations, when the
  morning air was rent by a shrill scream, of such fear that his flesh went
  cold. It came from the upper room and ended abruptly, as though somebody had
  put his hand over the mouth of the unfortunate from whom that cry of terror
  had been wrung.</p>

  <p>Hesitating no longer, Michael stepped from his place of concealment, ran
  quickly across the gravel, and pulled at the bell before the great entrance,
  which was immediately under the tower. He heard the clang of the bell and
  looked quickly round, to make absolutely sure that Bhag or some of the
  copper-coloured retainers of Griff Towers were not trailing him.</p>

  <p>A minute passed&mdash;two&mdash;and his hand was again raised to the iron
  bell-pull, when he heard heavy feet in the corridor, a shuffle of slippers on
  the tiled floor of the hall, and a gruff voice demanded: "Who's there?"</p>

  <p>"Michael Brixan."</p>

  <p>There was a grunt, a rattle of chains, a snapping of locks, and the big
  door opened a few inches.</p>

  <p>Gregory Penne was wearing a pair of grey flannel trousers and a shirt, the
  wristbands of which were unfastened. His malignant glare changed to wonder at
  the sight of the detective.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he demanded, and opened the door a few more
  inches.</p>

  <p>"I want to see you," said Michael.</p>

  <p>"Usually call at daybreak?" growled the man as he closed the door on his
  visitor.</p>

  <p>Michael made no answer, but followed Gregory Penne to his room. The
  library had evidently been occupied throughout the night. The windows were
  shuttered, the electroliers were burning, and before the fire was a table and
  two whisky bottles, one of which was empty.</p>

  <p>"Have a drink?" said Penne mechanically, and poured himself out a portion
  with an unsteady hand.</p>

  <p>"Is your ape in?" asked Michael, refusing the proffered drink with a
  gesture.</p>

  <p>"What, Bhag? I suppose so. He goes and comes as he likes. Do you want to
  see him?"</p>

  <p>"Not particularly," said Michael. "I've seen him once tonight."</p>

  <p>Penne was lighting the stub of a cigar from the fire as he spoke, and he
  looked round quickly.</p>

  <p>"You've seen him before? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him at the Dower House, trying to get into Miss Leamington's room,
  and he was as near to being a dead orang-outang as he has ever been."</p>

  <p>The man dropped the lighted spill on the hearth and stood up.</p>

  <p>"Did you shoot him?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I shot at him."</p>

  <p>Gregory nodded.</p>

  <p>"You shot at him," he said softly. "That accounts for it. Why did you
  shoot him? He's perfectly harmless."</p>

  <p>"He didn't strike me that way," said Michael coolly. "He was trying to
  pull Miss Leamington from her room."</p>

  <p>The man's eyes opened. "He got so far, did he? Well?" There was a
  pause.</p>

  <p>"You sent him to get the girl." said Michael. "You also bribed Foss to put
  a mark on the window so that Bhag should know where the girl was
  sleeping."</p>

  <p>He paused, but the other made no reply.</p>

  <p>"The cave-man method is fairly beastly, even when the cave-man does his
  own kidnapping. When he sends an anthropoid ape to do his dirty work, it
  passes into another category."</p>

  <p>The man's eyes were invisible now his face had grown a deeper hue.</p>

  <p>"So that's your line, is it?" he said. "I thought you were a pal."</p>

  <p>"I'm not responsible for your illusions," said Michael. "Only I tell you
  this"&mdash;he tapped the man's chest with his finger&mdash;"if any harm
  comes to Adele Leamington that is traceable to you or your infernal agent, I
  shan't be contented with shooting Mr. Bhag; I will come here and shoot you!
  Do you understand? And now you can tell me what is the meaning of that scream
  I heard from your tower."</p>

  <p>"Who the hell do you imagine you're cross-questioning?" spluttered Penne,
  livid with fury. "You dirty, miserable little actor!"</p>

  <p>Michael slipped a card from his pocket and put it in the man's hand.</p>

  <p>"You'll find my title to question you legibly inscribed," he said,</p>

  <p>The man brought the card to the table-lamp and read it. The effect was
  electrical. His big jaw dropped, and the hand that held the card trembled so
  violently that it dropped to the floor.</p>

  <p>"A detective?" he croaked. "A&mdash;a detective! What do you want
  here?"</p>

  <p>"I heard somebody scream." said Michael.</p>

  <p>"One of the servants maybe. We've got a Papuan woman here who's ill: in
  fact, she's a little mad, and we're moving her tomorrow. I'll go and see if
  you like?"</p>

  <p>He looked toward Michael as though seeking permission. His whole attitude
  was one of humility, and Michael required no more than the sight of that
  pallid face and those chattering teeth to turn his suspicion to certainty.
  Something was happening in this house that he must get to the bottom of.</p>

  <p>"May I go and see?" asked Penne.</p>

  <p>Michael nodded. The stout man shuffled out of the room as though he were
  in a hurry to be gone, and the lock clicked. Instantly Michael was at the
  door, turned the handle and pulled. It was locked!</p>

  <p>He looked round the room quickly, and, running to one of the windows,
  flung back the curtain and pulled at the shutter. But this too was locked. It
  was, to all intents and purposes, a door with a little keyhole at the bottom.
  He was examining this when all the lights in the room went out, the only
  illumination being a faint red glow from the fire.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">XIII. THE TRAP THAT FAILED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AND then Michael heard a faint creak in one corner of the
  room. It was followed by the almost imperceptible sound of bare feet on the
  thick pile carpet and the noise of quick breathing.</p>

  <p>He did not hesitate. Feeling again for the keyhole of the shutter, he
  pulled out his pistol and fired twice at the lock. The sound of the explosion
  was deafening in the confined space of the room. It must have had an
  electrical effect upon the intruder, for when, with a wrench, the shutter
  opened, and at a touch the white blind sprang up, flooding with light the
  big, ornate room, it was empty.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately afterwards the door opened through which the baronet
  had passed. If he had been panic-stricken before, his condition was now
  pitiable.</p>

  <p>"What's that? What's that?" he whimpered. "Did somebody shoot?"</p>

  <p>"Somebody shot," said Michael calmly, "and I was the somebody. And the
  gentlemen you sent into the room to settle accounts with me are very lucky
  that I confined my firing-practice to the lock of your shutter, Penne."</p>

  <p>He saw something white on the ground, and, crossing the room with quick
  strides, picked it up. It was a scarf of coarse silk, and he smelt it.</p>

  <p>"Somebody dropped this in their hurry," he said. "I guess it was to be
  used."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, I assure you I didn't know."</p>

  <p>"How is the interesting invalid?" asked Michael with a curl of his lip.
  "The lunatic lady who screams?"</p>

  <p>The man fingered his trembling lips for a moment as though he were trying
  to control them.</p>

  <p>"She's all right. It was as I&mdash;as I thought," he said; "she had some
  sort of fit."</p>

  <p>Michael eyed him pensively.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see her, if I may," he said.</p>

  <p>"You can't." Penne's voice was loud, defiant. "You can't see anybody! What
  the hell do you mean by coming into my house at this hour of the morning and
  damaging my property? I'll have this matter reported to Scotland Yard, and
  I'll get the coat off your back, my man! Some of you detectives think you own
  the earth, but I'll show you you don't!"</p>

  <p>The blustering voice rose to a roar. He was smothering his fear in weak
  anger. Michael thought, and looked up at the swords above the mantelpiece.
  Following the direction of his eyes, Sir Gregory wilted, and again his manner
  changed.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, why exasperate me? I'm the nicest man in the world if you
  only treat me right. You've got crazy ideas about me, you have indeed!"</p>

  <p>Michael did not argue. He walked slowly down the passage and out to meet
  the first sector of a blazing sun. As he reached the door he turned to the
  man.</p>

  <p>"I cannot insist upon searching your house because I have not a warrant,
  as you know, and by the time I'd got a warrant there would be nothing to
  find. But you look out, my friend!" He waved a warning finger at the man. "I
  hate dragging in classical allusions, but I should advise you to look up a
  lady in mythology who was known to the Greeks as Adrastia!"</p>

  <p>And with this he left, walking down the drive, watched with eyes of
  despair by a pale-faced girl from the upper window of the tower, whilst Sir
  Gregory went back to his library and, by much diligent searching, discovered
  that Adrastia was another name for Nemesis.</p>

  <p>Michael was back at the Dower House in time for breakfast. It was no great
  tribute to his charm that his absence had passed unnoticed&mdash;or so it
  appeared, though Adele had marked his disappearance and had been the first to
  note his return.</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth was in his most cheery mood. The scenes had been, he
  thought, most successful.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell, of course, until I get back to the laboratory and develop
  the pictures; but so far as young Leamington is concerned, she's wonderful. I
  hate predicting at this early stage, but I believe that she's going to be a
  great artiste."</p>

  <p>"You didn't expect her to be?" said Michael in surprise.</p>

  <p>Jack laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"I was very annoyed with Mendoza, and when I took this outfit on location
  I did so quite expecting that I should have to return and retake the picture
  with Mendoza in the cast. Film stars aren't born, they're made: they're made
  by bitter experience, patience, and suffering. They have got to pass through
  stages of stark inefficiency, during which they're liable to be discarded,
  before they win out. Your girl has skipped all the intervening phases and has
  won at the first time of asking."</p>

  <p>"When you talk about 'my girl'," said Michael carefully, "will you be good
  enough to remember that I have the merest and most casual interest in the
  lady?"</p>

  <p>"If you're not a liar," said Jack Knebworth, "you're a piece of
  cheese!"</p>

  <p>"What chance has she as a film artiste?" asked Michael, anxious to turn
  the subject.</p>

  <p>Knebworth ruffled his white hair.</p>

  <p>"Precious little," he said. "There isn't a chance for a girl in England.
  That's a horrible thing to say, but it's true. You can count the so-called
  English stars on the fingers of one hand; they've only a local reputation and
  they're generally married to the producer. What chance has an outsider got of
  breaking into the movies? And even if they break in, it's not much good to
  them. Production in this country is streets behind production either in
  America or in Germany. It is even behind the French, though the French films
  are nearly the dullest in the world. The British producer has no ideas of his
  own; he can adopt and adapt the stunts, the tricks of acting, the methods of
  lighting, that he sees in foreign films at trade shows; and with the aid of
  an American camera-man he can produce something which might have been
  produced a couple of years ago at Hollywood. It's queer, because England has
  never been left behind as she has been in the cinema industry. France started
  the motor-car industry: today, England makes the finest motor-car in the
  world. America started aviation: today, the British aeroplanes have no
  superior. And yet, with all the example before them, with all the immense
  profits which are waiting to be made, in the past twenty years England has
  not produced one film star of international note, one film picture with an
  international reputation."</p>

  <p>It was a subject upon which he was prepared to enlarge, and did enlarge,
  throughout the journey back to Chichester.</p>

  <p>"The cinema industry is in the hands of showmen all the world over, but in
  England it is in the hands of peep-showmen, as against the Barnums of the
  States. No, there's no chance for your little friend, not in this country. If
  the picture I'm taking makes a hit in America&mdash;yes. She'll be playing at
  Hollywood in twelve months' time in an English story &mdash;directed by
  Americans!"</p>

  <p>In the outer lobby of his office he found a visitor waiting for him, and
  gave her a curt and steely good morning.</p>

  <p>"I want to see you, Mr. Knebworth," said Stella Mendoza, with a smile at
  the leading-man, who had followed Knebworth into his office.</p>

  <p>"You want to see me, do you? Why, you can see me now. What do you
  want?"</p>

  <p>She was pulling at a lace handkerchief with a pretty air of penitence and
  confusion. Jack was not impressed. He himself had taught her all that
  handkerchief stuff.</p>

  <p>"I've been very silly, Mr. Knebworth, and I've come to ask your pardon. Of
  course, it was wrong to keep the boys and girls waiting, and I really am
  sorry. Shall I come in the morning? Or can I start today?"</p>

  <p>A faint smile trembled at the corners of the director's big mouth.</p>

  <p>"You needn't come in the morning and you needn't stay today, Stella," he
  said. "Your substitute has done remarkably well, and I don't feel inclined to
  retake the picture."</p>

  <p>She flashed an angry glance at him, a glance at total variance with her
  softer attitude.</p>

  <p>"I've got a contract: I suppose you know that, Mr. Knebworth?" she said
  shrilly.</p>

  <p>"I'd ever so much rather play opposite Miss Mendoza," murmured a gentle
  voice. It was the youthful Reggie Connolly, he of the sleek hair. "It's not
  easy to play opposite Miss&mdash;I don't even know her name. She's
  so&mdash;well, she lacks the artistry, Mr. Knebworth."</p>

  <p>Old Jack didn't speak. His gloomy eyes were fixed upon the youth.</p>

  <p>"What's more; I don't feel I can do myself justice with Miss Mendoza out
  of the cast," said Reggie. "I really don't! I feel most awfully, terribly
  nervous, and it's difficult to express one's personality when one's awfully,
  terribly nervous. In fact," he said recklessly, "I'm not inclined to go on
  with the picture unless Miss Mendoza returns."</p>

  <p>She shot a grateful glance at him, and then turned with a slow smile to
  the silent Jack.</p>

  <p>"Would you like me to start today?"</p>

  <p>"Not today, or any other day," roared the old director, his eyes flaming.
  "As for you, you nut-fed chorus-boy, if you try to let me down I'll blacklist
  you at every studio in this country, and every time I meet you I'll kick you
  from hell to Halifax!"</p>

  <p>He came stamping into the office, where Michael had preceded him, a raging
  fury of a man.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of that?" he asked when he had calmed down. "That's the
  sort of stuff they try to get past you! He's going to quit in the middle of a
  picture! Did you hear him? That cissy-boy! That mouse! Say, Brixan, would you
  like to play opposite this girl of mine? You can't be worse than Connolly,
  and it would fill in your time whilst you're looking for the
  Head-Hunter."</p>

  <p>Michael shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," he said. "That is not my job. And as for the
  Head-Hunter,"&mdash;he lit a cigarette and sent a ring of smoke to the
  ceiling&mdash;"I know who he is and I can lay my hands on him just when I
  want."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">XIV. MENDOZA MAKES A FIGHT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JACK stared at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"You're joking!" he said.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I am very much in earnest," said Michael quietly. "But
  to know the Head-Hunter, and to bring his crimes home to him, are quite
  different matters."</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth sat at his desk, his hands thrust into his trousers
  pockets, a look of blank incredulity on the face turned to the detective.</p>

  <p>"Is it one of my company?" he asked, troubled, and Michael laughed.</p>

  <p>"I haven't the pleasure of knowing all your company," he said
  diplomatically, "but, at any rate, don't let the Head-Hunter worry you. What
  are you going to do about Mr. Reggie Connolly?"</p>

  <p>The director shrugged.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't mean it, and I was a fool to get wild," he said. "That kind of
  ninny never means anything. You wouldn't dream, to see him on the screen,
  full of tenderness and love and manliness, that he's the poor little
  jellyfish he is! As for Mendoza&mdash;" He swept his hands before him, and
  the gesture was significant.</p>

  <p>Miss Stella Mendoza, however, was not accepting her dismissal so readily.
  She had fought her way up from nothing, and was not prepared to forfeit her
  position without a struggle. Moreover, her position was a serious one. She
  had money&mdash;so much money that she need never work again; for, in
  addition to her big salary, she enjoyed an income from a source which need
  not be too closely inquired into. But there was a danger that Knebworth might
  carry the war into a wider field.</p>

  <p>Her first move was to go in search of Adele Leamington, who, she learnt
  that morning for the first time, had taken her place. Though she went in a
  spirit of conciliation, she choked with anger to discover that the girl was
  occupying the star's dressing-room, the room which had always been sacred to
  Stella Mendoza's use. Infuriated, yet preserving an outward calm, she knocked
  at the door. (That she, Stella Mendoza, should knock at a door rightfully
  hers was maddening enough!)</p>

  <p>Adele was sitting at the bare dressing-table, gazing, a little
  awe-stricken, at the array of mirrors, lights and the vista of dresses down
  the long alley-way which served as a wardrobe. At the sight of Mendoza she
  went red.</p>

  <p>"Miss Leamington, isn't it?" asked Stella sweetly. "May I come in?"</p>

  <p>"Do, please," said Adele, hastily rising.</p>

  <p>"Please do sit down," said Stella. "It's a very uncomfortable chair, but
  most of the chairs here are uncomfortable. They tell me you have been
  'doubling' for me."</p>

  <p>"'Doubling'?" said Adele, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Knebworth said he was 'doubling' you. You know what I mean: when
  an artiste can't appear, they sometimes put in an understudy in scenes where
  she's not very distinctly shown&mdash;long shots&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But Mr. Knebworth took me close up," said the girl quietly. "I was only
  in one long shot."</p>

  <p>Miss Mendoza masked her anger and sighed.</p>

  <p>"Poor old chap! He's very angry with me and really I oughtn't to annoy
  him. I'm coming back tomorrow, you know."</p>

  <p>The girl went pale.</p>

  <p>"It's fearfully humiliating for you, I realize, but, my dear, we've all
  had to go through that experience. And people in the studio will be very nice
  to you."</p>

  <p>"But it's impossible," said Adele. "Mr. Knebworth told me I was to be in
  the picture from start to finish."</p>

  <p>Mendoza shook her head smilingly.</p>

  <p>"You can never believe what these fellows tell you," she said. "He's just
  told me to be ready to shoot tomorrow morning on the South Downs."</p>

  <p>Adele's heart sank. She knew that was the rendezvous, though she was not
  aware of the fact that Stella Mendoza had procured her information from the
  disgruntled Mr. Connolly.</p>

  <p>"It is humiliating," Stella went on thoughtfully. "If I were you, I would
  go up to town and stay away for a couple of weeks till the whole thing has
  blown over. I feel very much to blame for your disappointment, my dear, and
  if money is any compensation&mdash;" She opened her bag and, taking out a wad
  of notes, detached four and put them on the table.</p>

  <p>"What is this for?" asked Adele coldly.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear, you'll want money for expenses&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you imagine I'm going to London without seeing Mr. Knebworth and
  finding out for myself whether you're speaking the truth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mendoza's face flamed.</p>

  <p>"Do you suggest I'm lying?"</p>

  <p>She had dropped all pretence of friendliness, and stood, a veritable
  virago, her hands on her hips, her dark face thrust down into Adele's.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you're a liar or whether you are mistaken," said
  Adele, who was less afraid of this termagant than she had been at the news
  she had brought. "The only thing I'm perfectly certain about is that for the
  moment this is my room, and I will ask you to leave it!"</p>

  <p>She opened the door, and for a moment was afraid that the girl would
  strike her; but the broad-shouldered Irish dresser, a silent but passionately
  interested spectator and audience, interposed her huge bulk and
  good-humouredly pushed the raging star into the corridor.</p>

  <p>"I'll have you out of there!" she screamed across the woman's shoulder.
  "Jack Knebworth isn't everything in this company! I've got influence enough
  to fire Knebworth!"</p>

  <p>The unrepeatable innuendoes that followed were not good to hear, but Adele
  Leamington listened in scornful silence. She was only too relieved (for the
  girl's fury was eloquent) to know that she had not been speaking the truth.
  For one horrible moment Adele had believed her, knowing that Knebworth would
  not hesitate to sacrifice her or any other member of the company if by so
  doing the values of the picture could be strengthened.</p>

  <p>Knebworth was alone when his ex-star was announced, and his first instinct
  was not to see her. Whatever his intentions might have been, she determined
  his action by appearing in the doorway just as he was making up his mind what
  line to take. He fixed her with his gimlet eyes for a second, and then, with
  a jerk of his head, called her in. When they were alone:</p>

  <p>"There are many things I admire about you, Stella, and not the least of
  them is your nerve. But it is no good coming to me with any of that
  let-bygones-be-bygones stuff. You're not appearing in this picture, and maybe
  you'll never appear in another picture of mine."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" she drawled, sitting down uninvited, and taking from her bag
  a little gold cigarette-case.</p>

  <p>"You've come in to tell me that you've got influence with a number of
  people who are financially interested in this corporation," said Jack, to her
  dismay. She wondered if there were telephone communications between the
  dressing-room and the office, then remembered there weren't.</p>

  <p>"I've handled a good many women in my time," he went on, "and I've never
  had to fire one but she didn't produce the President, Vice-President or
  Treasurer and hold them over my head with their feet ready to kick out my
  brains! And, Stella, none of those hold ups have ever got past. People who
  are financially interested in a company may love you to death, but they've
  got to have the money to love you with; and if I don't make pictures that
  sell, somebody is short of a perfectly good diamond necklace."</p>

  <p>"We'll see if Sir Gregory thinks the same way," she said defiantly, and
  Jack Knebworth whistled.</p>

  <p>"Gregory Penne, eh? I didn't know you had friends in that quarter. Yes, he
  is a stockholder in the company, but he doesn't hold enough to make any
  difference. I guess he told you that he did. And if he held ninety-nine per
  cent of it, Stella, it wouldn't make any difference to old Jack Knebworth,
  because old Jack Knebworth's got a contract which gives him carte blanche,
  and the only getting-out clause is the one that gets me out. You couldn't
  touch me, Stella, no, ma'am!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're going to blacklist me?" she said sulkily.</p>

  <p>This was the one punishment she most feared&mdash;that Jack Knebworth
  should circulate the story of her unforgivable sin of letting down a picture
  when it was half-shot.</p>

  <p>"I thought about that," he nodded, "but I guess I'm not vindictive. I'll
  let you go and say the part didn't suit you, and that you resigned, which is
  as near the truth as any story I'll have to crack. Go with God, Stella. I
  guess you won't, because you're not that way, but&mdash;behave!"</p>

  <p>He waved her out of the office and she went somewhat chastened. Outside
  the studio she met Lawley Foss, and told him the result of the interview.</p>

  <p>"If it's like that you can do nothing," he said. "I'd speak for you,
  Stella, but I've got to speak for myself," he added bitterly. "The idea of a
  man of my genius truckling hat in hand to this damned old Yankee is very
  humiliating."</p>

  <p>"You ought to have your own company, Lawley," she said, as she had said a
  dozen times before. "You write the stuff and I'll be the leading-woman and
  put it over for you. Why, you could direct Kneb's head off. I know, Lawley!
  I've been to the only place on God Almighty's earth where art is appreciated,
  and I tell you that a four-flusher like Jack Knebworth wouldn't last a
  light-mile at Hollywood!"</p>

  <p>"Light-mile" was a term she had acquired from a scientific admirer. It had
  the double advantage of sounding grand and creating the demand for an
  explanation. To her annoyance, Foss was sufficiently acquainted with
  elementary physics to know that she meant the period of time that a ray of
  light would take to traverse a mile.</p>

  <p>"Is he in his office now?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and without any further word Lawley Foss, in some trepidation,
  knocked at his chief's door.</p>

  <p>"The truth is, Mr. Knebworth, I want to ask a favour of you."</p>

  <p>"Is it money?" demanded Jack, looking up from under his bushy brows.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was money, as a matter of fact. There have been one or two
  little bills I've overlooked, and the bailiffs have been after me. I've got
  to raise fifty pounds by two o'clock this afternoon."</p>

  <p>Jack pulled open a drawer, took out a book and wrote a cheque, not for
  fifty pounds, but for eighty.</p>

  <p>"That's a month's salary in advance," he said. "You've drawn your pay up
  to today, and by the terms of your contract you're entitled to one month's
  notice or pay therefore. You've got it."</p>

  <p>Foss went an ugly red.</p>

  <p>"Does that mean I'm fired?" he asked loudly.</p>

  <p>Jack nodded.</p>

  <p>"You're fired, not because you want money, not because you're one of the
  most difficult men on the lot to deal with, but for what you did last night,
  Foss."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean I am taking Mr. Brixan's view, that you fastened a white label to
  the window of Miss Leamington's room in order to guide an agent of Sir
  Gregory Penne. That agent came and nearly kidnapped my leading lady."</p>

  <p>The man's lip curled in a sneer.</p>

  <p>"You've got melodrama in your blood, Knebworth," he said. "Kidnap your
  leading lady! Those sort of things may happen in the United States, but they
  don't happen in England."</p>

  <p>"Close the door as you go out," said Jack preparing for his work.</p>

  <p>"Let me say this&mdash;" began Foss.</p>

  <p>"I'll let you say nothing," snarled Knebworth. "I won't even let you say
  'good-bye'. Get!"</p>

  <p>And, when the door slammed behind his visitor, the old director pushed a
  bell on his table, and, to his assistant who came:</p>

  <p>"Get Miss Leamington down here," he said. "I'd like contact with something
  that's wholesome."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15">XV. TWO FROM THE YARD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CHICHESTER is not famous for its restaurants, but the
  dining-room of a little hotel, where three people foregathered that
  afternoon, had the advantage of privacy.</p>

  <p>When Mike Brixan got back to his hotel he found two men waiting to see
  him, and after a brief introduction he took them upstairs to his
  sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you've come," he said, when the inspector had closed the door
  behind him. "The fact is that sheerly criminal work is a novelty to me, and
  I'm afraid that I'm going to make it a mystery to you," he smiled. "At the
  moment I'm not prepared to give expression to all my suspicions."</p>

  <p>Detective Inspector Lyle, the chief of the two, laughed.</p>

  <p>"We have been placed entirely under your orders, Captain Brixan," he said,
  "and neither of us are very curious. The information you asked for, Sergeant
  Walters has brought." He indicated his tall companion.</p>

  <p>"Which information&mdash;about Penne? Is he known to the police?" asked
  Michael, interested.</p>

  <p>Sergeant Walters nodded. "He was convicted and fined a few years ago for
  assaulting a servant&mdash;a woman. Apparently he took a whip to the girl,
  and he very narrowly escaped going to prison. That was the first time our
  attention was attracted to him, and we made inquiries both in London and in
  the Malay States and found out all about him. He's a very rich man, and,
  being a distant cousin of the late baronet, you may say he fluked his title.
  In Borneo he lived up-country, practically in the bush, for fifteen or twenty
  years, and the stories we have about him aren't particularly savoury. There
  are a few of them which you might read at your leisure, Mr.
  Brixan&mdash;they're in the record."</p>

  <p>Michael nodded.</p>

  <p>"Is anything known of an educated orang-outang which is his
  companion?"</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the officer answered:</p>

  <p>"Bhag? Oh yes, we know all about him. He was captured when he was quite a
  baby by Penne, and was brought up in captivity. It has been rather difficult
  to trace the man, because he never returns to England by the usual steamship
  line, so that it's almost impossible to have a tag on him. He has a yacht, a
  fine sea-going boat, the Kipi, which is practically officered and manned by
  Papuans. What comes and goes with him I don't know. There was a complaint
  came through to us that the last time he was abroad Penne nearly lost his
  life as the result of some quarrel he had with a local tribesman. Now, Mr.
  Brixan, what would you like us to do?"</p>

  <p>Michael's instructions were few and brief. That evening, when Adele walked
  home to her lodgings, she was conscious that a man was following her, and
  after her previous night's adventure this fact would have played havoc with
  her nerves but for the note she found waiting when she got indoors. It was
  from Michael.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Would you mind if I put a Scotland Yard man to watch you,
  to see that you do not get into mischief? I don't think there's any danger
  that you will, but I shall feel ever so much easier in my mind if you will
  endure this annoyance.</p><br>

  <p>She read the letter and her brows knit. So she was being shadowed! It was
  an uncomfortable experience, and yet she could not very well object
  &mdash;could not indeed feel anything but a sense of warm gratitude toward
  this ubiquitous and pushful young man, who seemed determined not to let her
  out of his sight.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap16"
     id="chap16">XVI. THE BROWN MAN PROM NOWHERE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">With a brand-new grievance against life, Lawley Foss
  gathered his forces to avenge himself upon the world that had treated him so
  harshly. And first and most powerful of his forces was Stella Mendoza. There
  was a council of war held in the drawing-room of the pretty little house that
  Stella had taken when she joined the Knebworth Corporation. The third of the
  party was Mr. Reggie Connolly. And as they were mutually sympathetic, so were
  they mutually unselfish&mdash;characteristically so.</p>

  <p>"We've been treated disgracefully by Knebworth, Mr. Foss, especially you.
  I think, compared with your case, mine is nothing."</p>

  <p>"It is the way he has handled you that makes me sore," said Foss
  energetically. "An artiste of your standing!"</p>

  <p>"The work you've done for him! And Reggie&mdash;he treated him like a
  dog!"</p>

  <p>"Personally, it doesn't matter to me," said Reggie. "I can always find a
  contract&mdash;it's you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For the matter of that, we can all find contracts," interrupted Stella
  with a taste of acid in her voice. "I can have my own company when I please,
  and I've got two directors mad to direct me, and two men I know would put up
  every cent of money to give me my own company&mdash;at least, they'd put up a
  lot. And Chauncey Seller is raving to play opposite me, and you know what a
  star he is: and he'd let me be featured and go into small type himself. He's
  a lovely man, and the best juvenile in this country or any other."</p>

  <p>Mr. Connolly coughed.</p>

  <p>"The point is, can we get the money now?" asked Foss, practical for
  once.</p>

  <p>There was no immediate and enthusiastic assurance from the girl.</p>

  <p>"Because, if not, I think I can get all I want," said Foss surprisingly.
  "I won't say from whom, or how I'm going to get it. But I'm certain I can get
  big money, and it will be easier to get it for some specific object than to
  ask for it for myself."</p>

  <p>"Less risky?" suggested Connolly, with a desire to be in the
  conversation.</p>

  <p>It was an unfortunate remark, the more so since by chance he had hit the
  nail on the head. Foss went a dull red.</p>

  <p>"What the hell do you mean by 'less risky'?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Poor Reggie had meant nothing, and admitted as much in some haste. He had
  meant to be helpful, and was ready to sulk at the storm he had aroused. More
  ready because, as the conversation had progressed, he had faded more and more
  into the background as an inconsiderable factor. There is nothing quite so
  disheartening to a conspirator as to find the conspiring taken out of his
  hands, and Reggie Connolly felt it was the moment to make a complete volte
  face, and incidentally assert what he was pleased to call his
  "personality".</p>

  <p>"This is all very well, Stella," he said, "but it looks to me as if I'm
  going to be left out in the cold. What with your thinking about Chauncey
  Seller&mdash;he's let down more pictures than any two men I know&mdash;and
  all that sort of thing, I don't see that I'm going to be much use to you. I
  don't really. I know you'll think I'm a fearful, awful rotter, but I feel
  that we owe something to old Jack Kneb, I do really. I've jeopardized my
  position for your sake, and I'm prepared to do anything in reason, but what
  with pulling Chauncey Seller&mdash;who is a bounder of the worst
  kind&mdash;into your cast, and what with Foss jumping down my throat, well,
  really&mdash;really!"</p>

  <p>They were not inclined to mollify him, having rather an eye to the future
  than to the present, and he had retired in a huff before the girl realized
  that the holding of Reggie would at least have embarrassed Knebworth to the
  extent of forcing a retake of those parts of the picture in which he
  appeared.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about Connolly. The picture is certain to fail with that
  extra: she's bad. I have a friend in London," explained Foss, after the
  discussion returned to the question of ways and means, "who can put up the
  money. I've got a sort of pull with him. In fact&mdash;well, anyhow, I've got
  a pull. I'll go up tonight and see him."</p>

  <p>"And I'll see mine," said Stella. "We'll call the company The Stella
  Mendoza Picture Corporation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lawley Foss demurred. He was inclined to another title, and was prepared
  to accept as a compromise the Foss-Mendoza or F.M. Company, a compromise
  agreeable to Stella provided the initials were reversed.</p>

  <p>"Who is Brixan?" she asked as Foss was leaving.</p>

  <p>"He is a detective."</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes wide.</p>

  <p>"A detective? Whatever is he doing here?"</p>

  <p>Lawley Foss smiled contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"He is trying to discover what no man of his mental calibre will ever
  discover, the Head-Hunter. I am the one man in the world who could help him.
  Instead of which"&mdash;he smiled again&mdash;"I am helping myself."</p>

  <p>With which cryptic and mystifying statement he left her.</p>

  <p>Stella Mendoza was an ambitious woman, and when ambition is directed
  toward wealth and fame it is not attended by scruple. Her private life and
  her standard of values were no better and no worse than thousands of other
  women, and no more belonged to her profession than did her passion for good
  food and luxurious environment. The sins of any particular class or
  profession are not peculiar to their status or calling, but to their
  self-education in the matter of the permissible. As one woman would die
  rather than surrender her self-respect, so another would lose her
  self-respect rather than suffer poverty and hardship, and think little or
  nothing of the act or the deceit she practises to gain her ends.</p>

  <p>Alter Foss had gone, she went up to her room to change. It was too early
  to make the call she intended, for Sir Gregory did not like to see her during
  the day time. He who had not hesitated to send Bhag on a fantastic mission
  was a stickler for the proprieties.</p>

  <p>Having some letters to post, she drove into Chichester late in the
  afternoon, and saw Mike Brixan in peculiar circumstances. He was the centre
  of a little crowd near the market cross, a head above the surrounding people.
  There was a policeman present, she saw his helmet, and for a moment was
  inclined to satisfy her curiosity. She changed her mind, and when she
  returned the crowd had dispersed and Michael had disappeared, and, driving
  home, she wondered whether the detective had been engaged professionally.</p>

  <p>Mike himself had been attracted by the crowd which was watching the
  ineffectual efforts of a Sussex police man to make himself intelligible to a
  shock-haired brown-faced native, an incongruous figure in an ill-fitting suit
  of store clothes and a derby hat which was a little too large for him. In his
  hand he carried a bundle tied up in a bright green handkerchief, and under
  his arm a long object wrapped in linen and fastened with innumerable strings.
  At the first sight of him Michael thought it was one of Penne's Malayan
  servants, but on second thoughts he realized that Sir Gregory would not allow
  any of his slaves to run loose about the countryside.</p>

  <p>Pushing his way through the crowd, he came up to the policeman, who
  touched his helmet rim and grinned.</p>

  <p>"Can't make head or tail of this fellow's lingo, sir," he said. "He wants
  to know something, but I can't make out what. He has just come into the
  city."</p>

  <p>The brown man turned his big dark eyes upon Mike and said something which
  was Greek to the detective. There was a curious dignity about the native that
  even his ludicrous garments could not wholly dissipate, an erectness of body,
  a carriage of head, an imponderable air of greatness that instantly claimed
  Michael Brixan's attention.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly he had an inspiration, and addressed the man in Dutch.
  Immediately the native's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>"Jet, mynheer, I speak Dutch."</p>

  <p>Mike had guessed that he came from Malaya, where Dutch and Portuguese are
  spoken by the better-class natives.</p>

  <p>"I am from Borneo, and I seek a man who is called Truji, an Englishman.
  No, mynheer, I wish to see his house, for he is a great man in my country.
  When I have seen his house I will go back to Borneo."</p>

  <p>Mike was watching him as he talked. It was a particularly good-looking
  face, except for the long and ugly scar that ran from his forehead to the
  point of his jaw.</p>

  <p>A new servant for Gregory Penne, thought the detective, and gave him
  directions. Standing by the policeman's side, he watched the queer figure
  with its bundles till it disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Queer language, that, sir," said the officer. "It was Dutch to me."</p>

  <p>"And to me!" chuckled Mike, and continued his way to the hotel.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap17"
     id="chap17">XVII. MR. FOSS MAKES A SUGGESTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IMMERSED in her beloved script, Adele Leamington sat on her
  bed, a box of <i>marrons glacés</i> by her side, her knees tucked up, and a
  prodigious frown on her forehead. Try as hard as she would, she found it
  impossible to concentrate upon the intricate directions with which Foss
  invariably tortured the pages of his scenarios. Ordinarily she could have
  mastered this handicap, but, for some reason or other, individual thoughts
  which belonged wholly to her and had no association with her art came flowing
  forth in such volume that the lines were meaningless and the page, for all
  the instruction it gave to her, might as well have been blank.</p>

  <p>What was Michael Brixan? He was not her idea of a detective, and why was
  he staying in Chichester? Could it be... ? She flushed at the thought and was
  angry with herself. It was hardly likely that a man who was engaged in
  unravelling a terrible crime would linger for the sake of being near to her.
  Was the Head Hunter, the murderer, living near Chichester? She dropped her
  manuscript to her knees at the appalling thought.</p>

  <p>The voice of her landlady aroused her.</p>

  <p>"Will you see Mr. Foss miss?"</p>

  <p>She jumped up from the bed and opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"I've put him in the parlour," said the woman, who had grown a little more
  respectful of late. Possibly the rise of the extra to stardom was generally
  known in that small town, which took an interest in the fortunes of its one
  ewe lamb of a production company.</p>

  <p>Lawley Foss was standing by the window, looking out, when she came into
  the room.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, Adele," he said genially. (He had never called her by her
  Christian name before, even if he had known it.)</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Foss," she said with a smile. "I'm sorry to hear that
  you have left us."</p>

  <p>Foss lifted his shoulders in a gesture of indifference. "The scope was a
  little too limited for my kind of work," he said.</p>

  <p>He was wondering if Mike had told her about the disc of paper on her
  window, and surmised rightly that he had not. Foss himself did not attach any
  significance to the white disc, accepting Gregory's explanation, which was
  that, liking the girl, he wished to toss some flowers and a present, by way
  of a peace-offering, through a window which he guessed would be open. Foss
  had thought him a love-sick fool, and had obliged him. The story that
  Knebworth had told he dismissed as sheer melodrama.</p>

  <p>"Adele, you're a foolish little girl to turn down a man like Gregory
  Penne," he said, and saw by her face that he was on dangerous ground.
  "There's no sense in getting up in the air; after all, we're human beings,
  and it isn't unnatural that Penne should have a crush on you. There's nothing
  wrong in that. Hundreds of girls have dinner with men without there being
  anything sinister in it. I'm a friend of Penne's, in a way, and I'm seeing
  him tonight on a very important and personal matter&mdash;will you come
  along?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"There may be no harm in it," she said, "but there is no pleasure in it
  either."</p>

  <p>"He's a rich man and a powerful man," said Foss impressively. "He could be
  of service to you."</p>

  <p>Again she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I want no other help than my own ability," she said. "I nearly said
  'genius', but that would have sounded like conceit. I do not need the
  patronage of any rich man. If I cannot succeed without that, then I am a
  hopeless failure and am content to be one!"</p>

  <p>Still Foss lingered.</p>

  <p>"I think I can manage without you," he said, "but I'd have been glad of
  your co-operation. He's crazy about you. If Mendoza knew that, she'd kill
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Miss Mendoza?" gasped the girl. "But why? Does she&mdash;she know
  him?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes; very few people are aware of the fact. There was a time when he'd
  have done anything for her, and she was a wise girl&mdash;she let him help!
  Mendoza has money to burn and diamonds to fill the Jewel House!"</p>

  <p>Adele listened, horror-stricken, incredulous, and he hastened to insure
  himself against Stella's wrath.</p>

  <p>"You needn't tell her I told you&mdash;this is in strict confidence. I
  don't want to get on the wrong side of Penne either," he shivered. "That
  man's a devil."</p>

  <p>Her lips twitched.</p>

  <p>"And yet you calmly ask me to dine with him, and hold out the bait of Miss
  Mendoza's diamonds!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think she's awful?" he sneered.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry for her," said the girl quietly, "and I am determined not
  to be sorry for myself!"</p>

  <p>She opened the door to him in silence, and in silence he took his
  departure. After all, he thought, there was no need for any outside help. In
  his breast-pocket was a sheet of manuscript written on the Head Hunter's
  typewriter. That ought to be worth thousands when he made his revelation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap18"
     id="chap18">XVIII. THE FACE IN THE PICTURE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR SAMPSON LONGVALE was taking a gentle constitutional on
  the strip of path before his untidy house. He wore, as usual&mdash;for he was
  a creature of habit&mdash;a long, grey silk dressing-gown, fastened by a
  scarlet sash. On his head was his silk nightcap, and between his teeth a Clay
  churchwarden pipe, which he puffed solemnly as he walked.</p>

  <p>He had just bidden a courteous good night to the help who came in daily to
  tidy his living-rooms and prepare his meals, when he heard the sound of feet
  coming up the drive. He thought at first it was the woman returning (she had
  a habit of forgetting things); but when he turned, he saw the unprepossessing
  figure of a neighbour with whom he was acquainted in the sense that Sir
  Gregory Penne had twice been abominably rude to him.</p>

  <p>The old man watched with immobile countenance the coming of his unwelcome
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"Evening!" growled Penne. "Can I speak to you privately?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Longvale inclined his head courteously.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Sir Gregory. Will you come in?"</p>

  <p>He ushered the owner of Griff Towers into the long sitting-room and lit
  the candles. Sir Gregory glanced round, his lips curled in disgust at the
  worn poverty of the apartment, and when the old man had pushed up a chair for
  him, it was some time before he accepted the offer.</p>

  <p>"Now, sir," said Mr. Longvale courteously, "to what circumstances do I owe
  the pleasure of this visit?"</p>

  <p>"You had some actors staying here the other day?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Longvale inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"There was some fool talk about a monkey of mine trying to get into the
  house."</p>

  <p>"A monkey?" said Mr. Longvale in gentle surprise. "That is the first I
  have heard of monkeys."</p>

  <p>Which was true. The other looked at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" he asked. "You're not going to persuade me you didn't
  hear?"</p>

  <p>The old man stood up, a picture of dignity.</p>

  <p>"Do you suggest that I am lying, sir?" he said. "Because if you do, there
  is the door! And though it hurts me to be in the least degree discourteous to
  a guest of mine, I am afraid I have no other course than to ask you to leave
  my house."</p>

  <p>"All right, all right!" said Sir Gregory Penne impatiently. "Don't lose
  your temper, my friend. I didn't come to see you about that anyway. You're a
  doctor, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Longvale was obviously startled. "I practised medicine when I was
  younger," he said.</p>

  <p>"Poor, too?" Gregory looked round. "You haven't a shilling in the world,
  I'll bet."</p>

  <p>"There you are wrong," said old Mr. Longvale quietly. "I am an extremely
  wealthy man, and the fact that I do not keep my house in repair is due to the
  curious penchant of mine for decaying things. That is an unhealthy, probably
  a morbid, predilection of mine. How did you know I was a doctor?"</p>

  <p>"I heard through one of my servants. You set the broken finger of a
  carter."</p>

  <p>"I haven't practised for years," said Mr. Longvale. "I almost wish I had,"
  he added wistfully. "It is a noble science&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Anyway," interrupted Penne, "even if you can't be bought, you're a
  secretive old devil, and that suits me. There's a girl up at my house who is
  very ill. I don't want any of these prying country doctors nosing around my
  private affairs. Would you come along and see her?"</p>

  <p>The old man pursed his lips thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I should be most happy," he said, "but I am afraid my medical science is
  a little rusty. Is she a servant?"</p>

  <p>"In a way," said the other shortly. "When can you come?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come at once," said Mr. Longvale gravely, and went out, to return in
  his great-coat.</p>

  <p>The baronet looked at the ancient garment with a smile of derision.</p>

  <p>"Why the devil do you wear such old-fashioned clothes?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"To me they are very new," said the old man gently. "The garments of today
  are without romance, without the thrill which these bring to me." He patted
  the overlapping cape and smiled. "An old man is entitled to his fancies: let
  me be humoured, Sir Gregory."</p>

  <p>At the moment Mr. Sampson Longvale was driving to Grill Towers, Mike
  Brixan, summoned by messenger, was facing Jack Knebworth in his office.</p>

  <p>"I hope you didn't mind my sending for you, though it was a fool thing to
  do," said the director. "You remember that we shot some scenes at Griff
  Towers?"</p>

  <p>Michael nodded.</p>

  <p>"I want you to see one that we took, with the tower in the background, and
  tell me what you think of&mdash;something."</p>

  <p>Wonderingly, Michael accompanied the director to the projection-room.</p>

  <p>"My laboratory manager pointed it out to me in the negative," explained
  Jack as they seated themselves and the room went dark. "Of course, I should
  have seen it in the print."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Michael curiously.</p>

  <p>"That's just what I don't know," said the other, scratching his head, "but
  you'll see for yourself."</p>

  <p>There was a flicker and a furious clicking, and there appeared on the
  small screen which was used for projection purposes a picture of two people.
  Adele was one and Reggie Connolly the other, and Michael gazed stolidly,
  though with rising annoyance, at a love scene which was being enacted between
  the two.</p>

  <p>In the immediate background was the wall of the tower, and Michael saw for
  the first time that there was a little window which he did not remember
  having seen from the interior of the hall; it was particularly dark, and was
  lighted, even in daytime, by electric lamps.</p>

  <p>"I never noticed that window before," he said.</p>

  <p>"It's the window I want you to watch," said Jack Knebworth, and, even as
  he spoke, there came stealthily into view a face.</p>

  <p>At first it was indistinct and blurred, but later it came into focus. It
  was the oval face of a girl, dark-eyed, her hair in disorder, a look of
  unspeakable terror on her face. She raised her hand as if to beckon
  somebody&mdash;probably Jack himself, who was directing the picture. That, at
  least, was Jack's view. They had hardly time to get accustomed to the
  presence of the mystery girl when she disappeared, with such rapidity as to
  suggest that she had been dragged violently back.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of that?" asked Knebworth.</p>

  <p>Michael bit his lip thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Looks almost as though friend Penne had a prisoner in his dark tower. Of
  course, the woman whose scream I heard, and who he said was a servant! But
  the window puzzles me. There's no sign of it inside. The stairway leads out
  of the hall, but in such a position that it is impossible that the girl could
  have been standing either on the stairs or the landing. Therefore there must
  be a fifth wall inside, containing a separate staircase. Does this mean you
  will have to retake?"</p>

  <p>Jack shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, we can black her out: she's only on fifty feet of the film; but I
  thought you'd like to see it."</p>

  <p>The lights came on again, and they went back to the director's office.</p>

  <p>"I don't like Penne, for more reasons than one," said Jack Knebworth. "I
  like him less since I've found that he's better friends with Mendoza than I
  thought he was."</p>

  <p>"Who is Mendoza&mdash;the deposed star?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"Stella Mendoza&mdash;not a bad girl and not a good girl," he said. "I've
  been wondering why Penne always gave us permission to use his grounds for
  shooting, and now I know. I tell you that that house holds a few
  secrets."</p>

  <p>Michael smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"One, at least, of them will be revealed tonight," he said. "I am going to
  explore Griff Towers, and I do not intend asking permission of Sir Gregory
  Penne. And if I can discover what I believe is there to be discovered,
  Gregory Penne will sleep under lock and key this night!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap19"
     id="chap19">XIX. THE MIDNIGHT VISIT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MICHAEL BRIXAN had had sent down to him from town a heavy
  suit-case, which contained precious little clothing. He was busy with its
  contents for half an hour, when the boots of the hotel announced the arrival
  of the motor-cycle that had been hired for him.</p>

  <p>With a canvas bag strapped to his back, he mounted the machine, and was
  soon clear of the town, swerving through the twisting lanes of Sussex until
  he arrived at the Dower House, behind which he concealed his machine.</p>

  <p>It was eleven o'clock when he crossed the fields to the postern gate, on
  the alert all the time for the soft-footed Bhag. The postern was closed and
  locked&mdash;a contingency for which he was prepared. Unstrapping his bag, he
  took therefrom a bundle of rods and screwed three together. To the top he
  fastened a big, blunt hook, and, replacing the remainder of the rods, he
  lifted the hook till it rested on the top of the high wall, tested its
  stability, and in a few seconds had climbed his "ladder" and had jumped to
  the other side.</p>

  <p>He followed the path that he had taken before, keeping close to the
  bushes, and all the time watching left and right for Penne's monstrous
  servant. As he came to the end of the hedge, the hall door opened and two men
  came out. One was Penne, and for a moment he did not recognize the tall man
  by his side, until he heard his voice. Mr. Sampson Longvale!</p>

  <p>"I think she will be all right. The wounds are very peculiar. It looks
  almost as if she had been scratched by some huge claw," said Longvale. "I
  hope I have been of assistance, Sir Gregory, though, as I told you, it is
  nearly fifty years since I engaged in medical work."</p>

  <p>So old Longvale had been a doctor? Somehow this news did not surprise
  Michael. There was something in the old man's benevolence of countenance and
  easy manner which would have suggested a training in that profession to one
  less analytical than Michael Brixan.</p>

  <p>"My car will take you down," he heard Sir Gregory say.</p>

  <p>"No, no, thank you; I will walk. It is not very far. Good night, Sir
  Gregory."</p>

  <p>The baronet growled a good night and went back into the dimly lit hall,
  and Michael heard the rattle of chains as the door was fastened.</p>

  <p>There was no time to be lost. Almost before Mr. Sampson Longvale had
  disappeared into the darkness Michael had opened his canvas bag and had
  screwed on three more links to his ladder. From each rod projected a short,
  light, steel bracket. It was the type of hook ladder that firemen use, and
  Michael had employed this method of gaining entrance to a forbidden house
  many times in his chequered career.</p>

  <p>He judged the distance accurately, for when he lifted the rod and dropped
  the hook upon the sill of the little window the ladder hung only a few inches
  short of the ground. With a tug to test the hook, he went up hand over hand,
  and in a few seconds was prying at the window-sash. It needed little opening,
  for the catch was of elementary simplicity, and in another instant he was
  standing on the step of a dark and narrow stairway.</p>

  <p>He had provided himself with an electric torch, and he flashed a beam up
  and down. Below, he saw a small door which apparently led into the hall, and,
  by an effort of memory, he remembered that in the corner of the hall he had
  seen a curtain hanging, without attaching any importance to the fact. Going
  down, he tried the door and found it locked. Putting down his lantern, he
  took out a leather case of tools and began to manipulate the lock. In an
  incredibly short space of time the key turned. When he had assured himself
  that the door would open, he was satisfied. For the moment his work lay
  upstairs, and he climbed the steps again, coming to a narrow landing, but no
  door.</p>

  <p>A second, a third and a fourth flight brought him, as near as he could
  guess, to the top of the tower, and here he found a narrow exit. Listening,
  after a while he heard somebody moving about the room, and by the sound they
  made he supposed they wore slippers.</p>

  <p>Presently a door closed with a thud, and he tried the handle of the
  wicket. It was unlocked, and he opened it gently a fraction of an inch at a
  time, until he secured a view of the greater part of the chamber.</p>

  <p>It was a small, lofty room, unfurnished with the exception of a low bed in
  one corner, on which a woman lay. Her back was toward him, fortunately; but
  the black hair and the ivory yellow of the bare arm that lay on the coverlet
  told him that she was not European.</p>

  <p>Presently she turned and he saw her face, recognizing her immediately as
  the woman whose face he had seen in the picture. She was pretty in her wild
  way, and young. Her eyes were closed, and presently she began crying softly
  in her sleep.</p>

  <p>Michael was half-way in the room when he saw the handle of the other door
  turn, and, quick as a flash, stepped back into the darkness of the
  landing.</p>

  <p>It was Bhag, in his old blue overall, a tray of food in his great hands.
  He reached out his foot and pulled the table toward him, placing the viands
  by the side of the bed. The girl opened her eyes and sank back with a little
  cry of disgust; and Bhag, who was evidently used to these demonstrations of
  her loathing, shuffled out of the room.</p>

  <p>Again Michael pushed the door and crossed the room, unnoticed by the girl
  looking out into the passage; not six feet away from him Bhag was squatting,
  glaring in his direction.</p>

  <p>Michael closed the door quickly and flew back to the secret staircase,
  pulling the door behind him. He felt for a key, but there was none, and,
  without wasting another second, he ran down the stairs. The one thing he
  wished to avoid was an encounter which would betray his presence in the
  house.</p>

  <p>He made no attempt to get out of the window, but continued his way to the
  foot of the stairs, and passed through into the hall. This time he was able
  to close the door, for there were two large bolts at the top and the bottom.
  Pulling aside the curtain, he stepped gingerly into the hall. For a while he
  waited, and presently heard the shuffle of feet on the stairs and a sniff
  beneath the door.</p>

  <p>His first act was to ensure his retreat. Noiselessly he drew the bolts
  from the front door, slipped off the chain and turned the key. Then, as
  noiselessly, he made his way along the corridor toward Sir Gregory's
  room.</p>

  <p>The danger was that one of the native servants would see him, but this he
  must risk. He had observed on each of his previous visits that, short of the
  library, a door opened into what he knew must be an anteroom of some kind. It
  was unlocked, and he stepped into complete darkness. Groping along the wall,
  he found a row of switches, and pulled down the first. This lit two
  wall-brackets, sufficient to give him a general view of the apartment.</p>

  <p>It was a small drawing-room, apparently unused, for the furniture was
  sheeted with holland, and the fire-grate was empty. From here it was possible
  to gain access to the library through a door near the window. He switched off
  the light, locked the door on the inside, and tried the shutters. These were
  fastened by iron bars and were not, as in the case of the library, locked. He
  pulled them back, let the blind up, and gingerly raised a window. His second
  line of retreat was now prepared, and he could afford to take risks.</p>

  <p>Kneeling down, he looked through the key-hole. The library was
  illuminated, and somebody was talking. A woman! Turning the handle, he opened
  the door the fraction of an inch, and had a view of the interior.</p>

  <p>Gregory Penne was standing in his favourite attitude, with his back to the
  fire, and before him was a tray of those refreshments without which life was
  apparently insupportable. Seated on the low settee, drawn up at one side of
  the fireplace, was Stella Mendoza. She was wearing a fur coat, for the night
  was chilly, and about her neck was such a sparkle of gems as Michael had
  never seen before on a woman.</p>

  <p>Evidently the discussion was not a pleasant one, for there was a heavy
  scowl on Gregory's face, and Stella did not seem too pleased.</p>

  <p>"I left you because I had to leave you," growled the man, answering some
  complaint she had made. "One of my servants is ill and I brought in the
  doctor. And if I had stayed it would have been the same. It's no good, my
  girl," he said harshly. "The goose doesn't lay golden eggs more than
  once&mdash;this goose doesn't, at any rate. You were a fool to quarrel with
  Knebworth."</p>

  <p>She said something which did not reach Michael's ears. "I dare say your
  own company would be fine," said Penne sarcastically. "It would be fine for
  me, who footed the bill, and finer for you, who spent the money! No, Stella,
  that cat doesn't jump. I've been very good to you, and you've no right to
  expect me to bankrupt myself to humour your whims."</p>

  <p>"It's not a whim," she said vehemently, "it's a necessity. You don't want
  to see me going round the studios taking any kind of job I can get, do you,
  Gregory?" she pleaded.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to see you work at all, and there's no reason why you
  should. You've enough to live on. Anyway, you've got nothing against
  Knebworth. If it hadn't been for him you wouldn't have met me, and if you
  hadn't met me you'd have been poorer by thousands. You want a change."</p>

  <p>There was a silence. Her head was drooped, and Michael could not see the
  girl's face, but when she spoke there was that note of viciousness in her
  voice which told him her state of mind.</p>

  <p>"You want a change too, perhaps! I could tell things about you that
  wouldn't look good in print, and you'd have a change too! Get that in your
  mind, Gregory Penne! I'm not a fool&mdash;I've seen things and heard things,
  and I can put two and two together. You think I want a change, do you&mdash;I
  do! I want friends who aren't murderers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He sprang at her, his big hand covering her mouth.</p>

  <p>"You little devil!" he hissed, and at that instant somebody must have
  knocked, for he turned to the door and said something in the native
  dialect.</p>

  <p>The answer was inaudible to Mike.</p>

  <p>"Listen." Gregory was speaking to the girl in a calmer tone. "Foss is
  waiting to see me, and I'll discuss this little matter with you
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>He released her, and, going to his desk, touched the spring that operated
  the mechanism of the secret door that led to Bhag's quarters.</p>

  <p>"Go in there and wait," he said. "I'll not keep you longer than five
  minutes."</p>

  <p>She looked suspiciously at the door which had suddenly opened in the
  panelling.</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "I'll go home. Tomorrow will do. I'm sorry I got rough,
  Gregory, but you madden me sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Go in there!"</p>

  <p>He pointed to the den, his face working.</p>

  <p>"I'll not!" Her face was white. "You beast, don't you think I know? That
  is Bhag's den! Oh, you beast!"</p>

  <p>His face was horrible to see. It was as though all the foulness in his
  mind found expression in the demoniacal grimace.</p>

  <p>Breathless, terrified, the girl stared at him, shrinking back against the
  wall. Presently Gregory mastered himself.</p>

  <p>"Then go into the little drawing-room," he said huskily.</p>

  <p>Mike had time to switch out the lights and flatten himself against the
  wall, when the door of the room was flung open and the girl thrust in.</p>

  <p>"It is dark!" she wailed.</p>

  <p>"You'll find the switches!"</p>

  <p>The door banged.</p>

  <p>Michael Brixan was in a dilemma. He could see her figure groping along the
  wall, and stealthily he moved to avoid her. In doing so he stumbled over a
  stool.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" she screamed. "Gregory! Don't let him touch me,
  Gregory!"</p>

  <p>Again the piercing scream.</p>

  <p>Mike leapt past her and through the open window, and, the sound of her
  shrill agony in his ears, fled along the hedge. Swift as he was, something
  sped more quickly in pursuit&mdash;a great twittering something that ran bent
  double on hands and feet. The detective heard and guessed. From what secret
  hiding-place Bhag had appeared, whether he was in the grounds at the moment
  Mike jumped, he had no time even to guess. He felt a curious lightness of
  pocket at that moment and thrust in his hand. His pistol was gone. It must
  have fallen when he jumped.</p>

  <p>He could hear the pad of feet behind him as he darted at a tangent across
  field, blundering over the cabbage rows, slipping in furrows, the great beast
  growing closer and closer with every check. Ahead of him the postern. But it
  was locked, and, even if it had not been, the wall would have proved no
  obstacle to the ape. The barrier of the wall held Michael. Breathless,
  turning to face his pursuer, in the darkness he saw the green eyes shining
  like two evil stars.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap20"
     id="chap20">XX. A NARROW ESCAPE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MICHAEL BRIXAN braced himself for the supreme and futile
  struggle. And then, to his amazement, the ape stopped, and his bird noise
  became a harsh chatter. Raising himself erect, he beat quickly on his great
  hairy chest, and the sound of the hollow drumming was awful.</p>

  <p>Yet through that sound and above it Michael heard a curious hiss &mdash;it
  was the faint note of escaping steam, and he looked round. On the top of the
  wall squatted a man, and Michael knew him at once. It was the brown-faced
  stranger he had seen that day in Chichester.</p>

  <p>The drumming and the hissing grew louder, and then Michael saw a bright
  curved thing in the brown man's hand. It was a sword, the replica of that
  which hung above Sir Gregory's fireplace.</p>

  <p>He was still wondering when the brown man dropped lightly to the ground,
  and Bhag, with a squeal that was almost human, turned and fled. Michael
  watched the Thing, fascinated, until it disappeared into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"My friend," said Michael in Dutch, "you came at a good moment."</p>

  <p>He turned, but the brown man had vanished as though the earth had
  swallowed him. Shading his eyes against the starlight, he presently discerned
  a dark shape moving swiftly in the shadow of the wall. For a second he was
  inclined to follow and question the brown man, but decided upon another
  course. With some difficulty he surmounted the wall and dropped to the other
  side. Then, tidying himself as well as he could, he made the long circuit to
  the gate of Griff Towers, and boldly walked up to the house, whistling as he
  went.</p>

  <p>There was nobody in sight as he crossed the "parade ground", and his first
  step was to search for and find his pistol.</p>

  <p>He must know that the girl was safe before he left the place. He had seen
  her car waiting on the road outside. His hand was raised to the bell when he
  heard footsteps in the hall, and listened intently: there was no doubt that
  one of the voices was Stella Mendoza's, and he drew back again to cover.</p>

  <p>The girl came out, followed by Sir Gregory, and from their tone, a
  stranger unacquainted with the circumstances of their meeting might have
  imagined that the visit had been a very ordinary one, in spite of the
  lateness of the hour.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Sir Gregory," said the girl, almost sweetly. "I will see you
  tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Come to lunch," said Gregory's voice, "and bring your friend. Shall I
  walk with you to the car?"</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," she said hastily.</p>

  <p>Michael watched her till she was out of sight, but long before then the
  big door of Griff Towers had closed, and the familiar rattle of chains told
  him that it was closed finally.</p>

  <p>Where was Foss? He must have gone earlier, if Foss it was. Michael waited
  till all was quiet, and then, tip-toeing across the gravel, followed the
  girl. He looked about for the little brown man, but he was not in sight. And
  then he remembered that he had left the hook ladder hanging to the window on
  the stairs, and went back to retrieve it. He found the ladder as it had been
  left, unscrewed and packed it in the canvas bag, and five minutes later he
  was taking his motor-cycle from its place of concealment.</p>

  <p>A yellow light showed in the window of Mr. Longvale's dining-room, and
  Michael had half a mind to call upon him. He could tell him, at any rate,
  something of that oval-faced girl in the upper room of the tower. Instead, he
  decided to go home. He was tired with the night's work, a little
  disappointed. The tower had not revealed as tremendous a secret as he had
  hoped. The girl was a prisoner, obviously; had been kidnapped for Sir
  Gregory's pleasure, and brought to England on his yacht. Such things had
  happened; there had been a case in the courts on curiously parallel lines
  only a few months before. At any rate, it did not seem worth while to put off
  his bed-time.</p>

  <p>He had a hot bath, made himself some chocolate and, before retiring, sat
  down to sum up his day's experience. And in the light of recent happenings he
  was less confident that his first solution of the Head-Hunter mystery was the
  correct one. And the more he thought, the less satisfied he was, till at
  last, in sheer disgust at his own vacillation of mind, he turned out the
  light and went to bed.</p>

  <p>He was sleeping peacefully and late the next morning when an unexpected
  visitor arrived, and Michael sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I've either got nightmare or it's Staines," he said.</p>

  <p>Major Staines smiled cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"You're awake and normal," he said.</p>

  <p>"Has anything happened?" asked Michael, springing out of bed.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, only there was a late dance last night, and an early train this
  morning, and I decided to atone for my frivolity by coming down and seeing
  how far you had got in the Elmer case."</p>

  <p>"Elmer case?" Michael frowned. "Good lord! I'd almost forgotten poor
  Elmer!"</p>

  <p>"Here's something to remind you," said Staines.</p>

  <p>He fished from his pocket a newspaper cutting. Michael took it and
  read</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">"Is your trouble of mind or body incurable? Do you
  hesitate on the brink of the abyss? Does courage fail you? Write to
  Benefactor, Box&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>"What is this?" asked Michael, frowning.</p>

  <p>"It was found in the pocket of an old waistcoat that Elmer was wearing a
  few days before he disappeared. Mrs. Elmer was going through his clothes with
  the idea of selling them, when she found this. It appeared in the Morning
  Telegram of the fourteenth&mdash;that is to say, three or four days before
  Elmer vanished. The box number at the end, of course, is the box number of
  the newspaper to which replies were sent. There is a record that four letters
  reached the 'Benefactor', who, so far as we have been able to discover, had
  these particular letters readdressed to a little shop in Stibbington Street,
  London. Here they were collected by a woman, evidently of the working-class,
  and probably a charlady from the appearance which has been circulated. Beyond
  that, no further trace has been obtainable. Similar advertisements have been
  found by search in other newspapers, but in these cases the letters were sent
  to an accommodation address in South London where apparently the same woman
  collected them. With every new advertisement the advertiser changes his
  address. She was a stranger to each neighbourhood, by the way; and from what
  shopkeepers have told Scotland Yard, she seemed to be a little off her head,
  for she was in the habit of mumbling and talking to herself. Her name is
  Stivins&mdash;at least, that is the name she always gave. And the notes she
  brought were usually signed 'Mark'&mdash;that is to say, the notes
  authorizing the shopkeepers to hand the letters to her. That she is a native
  of London there is no doubt, but so far the police have not trailed her."</p>

  <p>"And suppose they do?" asked Michael. "Do you connect the advertisement
  with the murders?"</p>

  <p>"We do and we do not," replied the other. "I merely point out that this
  advertisement is a peculiar one, and in all the circumstances a little
  suspicious. Now, what is the theory you wanted to give me?"</p>

  <p>For an hour Michael spoke, interrupted at intervals by questions which
  Staines put to him.</p>

  <p>"It is a queer idea, almost a fantastical one," said Staines gravely, "but
  if you feel that you've got so much as one thread in your hands, go right
  ahead. To tell you the truth," in a burst of confidence, "I had a horrible
  feeling that you had fallen down; and since I do not want our department to
  be a source of amusement to Scotland Yard, I thought I'd come along and give
  you the result of my own private investigations. I agree with you," he said
  later, as they sat at breakfast, "that you want to go very, very carefully.
  It is a delicate business. You haven't told the Scotland Yard men your
  suspicions?"</p>

  <p>Michael shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Then don't," said the other emphatically. "They'd be certain to go along
  and put the person you suspect under arrest, and probably that would destroy
  the evidence that would convict. You say you have made a search of the
  house?"</p>

  <p>"Not a search: I've made a rough inspection."</p>

  <p>"Are there cellars?"</p>

  <p>"I should imagine so," said Michael. "That type of house usually has."</p>

  <p>"Outhouses where... "</p>

  <p>Michael shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There are none, so far as I have been able to see."</p>

  <p>Michael walked down to the railway station with his chief, who told him he
  was leaving in a much more cheerful frame of mind than he had been in when he
  arrived.</p>

  <p>"There's one warning I'll give to you, Mike," said Staines as the train
  was about to pull out of the station, "and it is to watch out for yourself!
  You're dealing with a ruthless and ingenious man. For heaven's sake do not
  underrate his intelligence. I don't want to wake up one morning to learn that
  you have vanished from the ken of man."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap21"
     id="chap21">XXI. THE ERASURE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MIKE'S way back did not lead through the little street where
  Adele Leamington lived&mdash;at least, not his nearest road. Yet he found
  himself knocking at the door, and learnt, with a sense of disappointment,
  that the girl had been out since seven o'clock in the morning. Knebworth was
  shooting on the South Downs, and the studio, when he arrived, was empty,
  except for Knebworth's secretary and the new scenario editor, who had arrived
  late on the previous evening.</p>

  <p>"I don't know the location, Mr. Brixan," said Dicker, the secretary, "but
  it's somewhere above Arundel. Miss Mendoza was here this morning, asking the
  same question. She wanted Miss Leamington to go out to lunch with her."</p>

  <p>"Oh, she did, did she?" said Michael softly. "Well, if she comes again,
  you can tell her from me that Miss Leamington has another engagement."</p>

  <p>The other nodded wisely.</p>

  <p>"I hope she won't keep you waiting," he said, "You never know, when Jack's
  on location&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I did not say she had an engagement with me," said Michael loudly.</p>

  <p>"That reminds me, Mr. Brixan," said the secretary suddenly. "Do you
  remember the fuss you made&mdash;I mean there was&mdash;about a sheet of
  manuscript that by some accident had got into Miss Leamington's script?"</p>

  <p>Michael nodded.</p>

  <p>"Has the manuscript been found?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, but the new scenario editor tells me that he was looking through the
  book where Foss kept a record of all the manuscripts that came in, and he
  found one entry had been blacked out with Indian ink."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see that book," said the interested Michael, and it was
  brought to him, a large foolscap ledger, ruled to show the name of the
  submitted scenario, the author, his address, the date received, and the date
  returned. Mike put it down on the table in Knebworth's private office and
  went carefully through the list of authors.</p>

  <p>"If he sent one he has probably sent more," he said. "There are no other
  erasures?"</p>

  <p>The secretary shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That is the only one we've seen," he said. "You'll find lots of names of
  local people&mdash;there isn't a tradesman in the place who hasn't written a
  scenario or submitted an idea since we've been operating."</p>

  <p>Slowly Michael's finger went up the column of names. Page after page was
  turned back. And then his finger stopped at an entry.</p>

  <p>"The Power of Fear: Sir Gregory Penne," he read, and looked round at
  Dicker.</p>

  <p>"Did Sir Gregory submit scenarios, Mr. Dicker?"</p>

  <p>Dicker nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he sent in one or two," he said. "You'll find his name farther back
  in the book. He used to write scenarios which he thought were suitable for
  Miss Mendoza. He's not the man you're looking for?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Michael quickly. "Have you any of his manuscript?"</p>

  <p>"They were all sent back," said Dicker regretfully. "He wrote awful mush!
  I read one of them. I remember Foss trying to persuade old Jack to produce
  it. Foss made quite a lot of money on the side, we've discovered. He used to
  take fees from authors, and Mr. Knebworth discovered this morning that he
  once took two hundred pounds from a lady on the promise that he'd get her
  into the pictures. He wrote Foss a stinging letter this morning about
  it."</p>

  <p>Presently Michael found Sir Gregory's name again. It was not remarkable
  that the owner of Griff Towers should have submitted a manuscript. There was
  hardly a thinking man or woman in the world who did not believe he or she was
  capable of writing for the films.</p>

  <p>He closed the book and handed it back to Dicker.</p>

  <p>"It is certainly queer, that erased entry. I'll speak to Foss about it as
  soon as I can find him," he said.</p>

  <p>He went immediately to the little hotel where Foss was staying, but he was
  out.</p>

  <p>"I don't think he came home last night," said the manager. "If he did, he
  didn't sleep in his bed. He said he was going to London," he added.</p>

  <p>Michael went back to the studio, for it had begun to rain, and he knew
  that that would drive the company from location. His surmise was correct: the
  big yellow char-a-banc came rumbling into the yard a few minutes after he got
  there. Adele saw him, and was passing with a nod when he called her to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mr. Brixan, but we lunched on location, and I have two big
  scenes to read for tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Her refusal was uncompromising, but Michael was not the type who readily
  accepted a "No".</p>

  <p>"What about tea? You've got to drink tea, my good lady, though you have
  fifty scenes to study. And you can't read and eat too. If you do, you'll get
  indigestion, and if you get indigestion&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"If my landlady will loan me her parlour, you may come to tea at half past
  four," she said; "and if you have another engagement at five o'clock, you'll
  be able to meet it."</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth was waiting for him when he went into the studio.</p>

  <p>"Heard about that entry in the scenario book?" he asked. "I see you have.
  What do you think of it?" Without waiting for a reply: "It looks queer to me.
  Foss was an unmitigated liar. That fellow couldn't see straight. I've got a
  little bone to pick with him on the matter of a fee he accepted from a
  screen-struck lady who wished to be featured in one of my productions."</p>

  <p>"How's the girl?" asked Michael.</p>

  <p>"You mean Adele? Really, she's wonderful, Brixan! I'm touching wood all
  the time"&mdash;he put his hand on the table piously&mdash;"because I know
  that there's a big shock coming to me somewhere and somehow. Those things do
  not happen in real life. The only stars that are born in a night are the
  fireworks produced by crazy vice-presidents who have promised to do something
  for Mamie and can't break their word. And Mamie, supported by six hundred
  extras and half a million dollars' worth of sets, two chariot races and the
  fall of Babylon, all produced regardless of expense, manages to get over by
  giving a fine imitation of what the Queen of Persia would look like if she'd
  been born a chorus-girl and trained as a mannequin. And she's either got so
  few clothes that you don't look at her face or so many clothes that you don't
  notice her acting.</p>

  <p>"Those kind of stars are like the dust of the Milky Way: there is so much
  splendour all round them that it wouldn't matter if they weren't there at
  all. But this girl Leamington, she's getting over entirely and absolutely by
  sheer, unadulterated grey matter. I tell you, Brixan, it's not right. These
  things do not happen except in the imagination of press agents. There's
  something wrong with that kid."</p>

  <p>"Wrong?" said Michael, startled.</p>

  <p>Knebworth nodded.</p>

  <p>"Something radically wrong. There's a snag somewhere. She's either going
  to let me down by vanishing before the picture's through, or else she's going
  to be arrested for driving a car along Regent Street in a highly intoxicated
  condition!"</p>

  <p>Michael laughed.</p>

  <p>"I think she'll do neither," he said.</p>

  <p>"Heard about Mendoza's new company?" asked old Jack, filling his pipe.</p>

  <p>Michael pulled up a chair and sat down.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't."</p>

  <p>"She's starting a new production company. There's never a star I've fired
  that hasn't! It gets all written out on paper, capital in big type, star in
  bigger! It's generally due to the friends of the star, who tell her that a
  hundred thousand a year is a cruel starvation wage for a woman of her genius,
  and she ought to get it all. Generally there's a sucker in the background who
  puts up the money. As a rule, he puts up all but enough, and then she selects
  a story where she is never off the screen, and wears a new dress every fifty
  feet of fillum. If she can't find that sort of story, why, she gets somebody
  to write her one. The only time you ever see the other members of the company
  is in the long shots. Half-way through the picture the money dries up, the
  company goes bust, and all the poor little star gets out of it is the
  Rolls-Royce she bought to take her on location, the new bungalow she built to
  be nearer the lot, and about twenty-five per cent of the capital that she's
  taken on account of royalties."</p>

  <p>"Mendoza will not get a good producer in England?"</p>

  <p>"She may," nodded Jack. "There are producers in this country, but
  unfortunately they're not the men on top. They've been brought down by the
  craze for greatness. A man who produces with a lot of capital behind him can
  get easy money. He doesn't go after the domestic stories, where he'd be found
  out first time; he says to the money-bags: 'Let's produce the "Fall of
  Jerusalem". I've got a cute idea for building Ezekiel's temple that's never
  been taken before. It'll only cost a mere trifle of two hundred thousand
  dollars, and we'll have five thousand extras in one scene, and we'll rebuild
  the Colosseum and have a hundred real lions in the arena! Story? What do you
  want a story for? The public love crowds.' Or maybe he wants to build a new
  Vesuvius and an eruption at the rate of fifty dollars a foot. There's many a
  big reputation been built up on sets and extras. Come in, Mr. Longvale."</p>

  <p>Michael turned. The cheery old man was at the door, hat in hand.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I am rather a nuisance," he said in his beautiful voice. "But
  I came in to see my lawyer, and I could not deny myself the satisfaction of
  calling to see how your picture is progressing."</p>

  <p>"It is going on well, Mr. Longvale, thank you," said Jack. "You know Mr.
  Brixan?"</p>

  <p>The old man nodded and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I came in to see my lawyer on what to you will seem to be a curious
  errand. Many years ago I was a medical student and took my final examination,
  so that I am, to all intents and purposes, a doctor, though I've not
  practised to any extent. It is not generally known that I have a medical
  degree, and I was surprised last night to be called out by&mdash;er&mdash;a
  neighbour, who wished me to attend a servant of his. Now, I am so hazy on the
  subject that I wasn't quite sure whether or not I'd broken the law by
  practising without registration."</p>

  <p>"I can relieve your mind there, Mr. Longvale," said Michael. "Once you are
  registered, you are always registered, and you acted quite within your
  rights."</p>

  <p>"So my lawyer informed me," said Longvale gravely.</p>

  <p>"Was it a bad case?" asked Michael, who guessed who the patient was.</p>

  <p>"No, it was not a bad case. I thought there was blood-poisoning, but I
  think perhaps I may have been mistaken. Medical science has made such great
  advance since I was a young man that I almost feared to prescribe. Whilst I
  am only too happy to render any service that humanity demands, I must confess
  that it was rather a disturbing experience, and I scarcely slept all night.
  In fact, it was a very disturbing evening and night. Somebody, for some
  extraordinary reason, put a motor-bicycle in my garden."</p>

  <p>Michael smiled to himself.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand why. It had gone this morning. And then I saw our
  friend Foss, who seemed very much perturbed about something."</p>

  <p>"Where did you see him?" asked Michael quickly.</p>

  <p>"He was passing my house. I was standing at the gate, smoking my pipe, and
  bade him good night without knowing who he was. When he turned back, I saw it
  was Mr. Foss. He told me he had been to make a call, and that he had another
  appointment in an hour."</p>

  <p>"What time was this?" asked Michael.</p>

  <p>"I think it must have been eleven o'clock." The old man hesitated. "I'm
  not sure. It was just before I went to bed."</p>

  <p>Michael could easily account for Foss's conduct. Sir Gregory had hurried
  him off and told him to come back after the girl had gone.</p>

  <p>"My little place used to be remarkable for its quietness," said Mr.
  Longvale, and shook his head, "Perhaps," turning to Knebworth, "when your
  picture is finished you will be so good as to allow me to see it?'</p>

  <p>"Why, surely, Mr. Longvale."</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I'm taking this tremendous interest," chuckled the old
  man. "I must confess that, until a few weeks ago, film-making was a mystery
  to me. And even today it belongs to the esoteric sciences."</p>

  <p>Dicker thrust his head in at the door.</p>

  <p>"Will you see Miss Mendoza?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth's expression was one of utter weariness.</p>

  <p>"No," he said curtly.</p>

  <p>"She says&mdash;" began Dicker.</p>

  <p>Only the presence of the venerable Mr. Longvale prevented Jack from
  expressing his views on Stella Mendoza and all that she could say.</p>

  <p>"There's another person I saw last night," nodded Mr. Longvale. "I thought
  at first you must be shooting&mdash;is that the expression? &mdash;in the
  neighbourhood, but Mr. Foss told me that I was mistaken. She's rather a
  charming girl, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"Very," said Jack dryly.</p>

  <p>"A very sweet disposition," Longvale went on, unconscious of the utter
  lack of sympathy in the atmosphere. "Nowadays, the confusion and hurry which
  modernity brings in its trail do not make for sweetness of temper, and one is
  glad to meet an exception. Not that I am an enemy of modernity. To me, this
  is the most delightful phase of my long life."</p>

  <p>"Sweet disposition!" almost howled Jack Knebworth when the old man had
  taken a dignified farewell. "Did you get that, Brixan? Say, if that woman's
  disposition is sweet, the devil's made of chocolate!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap22"
     id="chap22">XXII. THE HEAD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Mike went out, he found Stella at the gate of the
  studio, and remembered, seeing her, that she had been invited to lunch at
  Griff Towers. To his surprise she crossed the road to him.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to see you, Mr. Brixan," she said. "I sent in word to find if
  you were there."</p>

  <p>"Then your message was wrongly delivered to Mr. Knebworth," smiled
  Mike.</p>

  <p>She lifted one of her shoulders in demonstration of her contempt for Jack
  Knebworth and all his works.</p>

  <p>"No, it was you I wanted to see. You're a detective, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"I am," said Michael, wondering what was coming next.</p>

  <p>"My car is round the corner. Will you come to my house?"</p>

  <p>Michael hesitated. He was anxious, more than anxious, to speak to Adele
  though he had nothing special to tell her, beyond the thing which he himself
  did not know and she could never guess.</p>

  <p>"With pleasure," he said.</p>

  <p>She was a skilful motorist, and apparently so much engrossed in her
  driving that she did not speak throughout the journey. In the pretty little
  drawing-room from which he had a view of the lovely South Downs, he waited
  expectantly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brixan, I am going to tell you something which I think you ought to
  know."</p>

  <p>Her face was pale, her manner curiously nervous.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you will think of me when I have told you, but I've got
  to risk that. I can't keep silence any longer."</p>

  <p>A shrill bell sounded in the hall.</p>

  <p>"The telephone. Will you excuse me one moment?" She hurled out, leaving
  the door slightly ajar. Michael heard her quick, angry reply to somebody at
  the other end of the wire, and then a long interregnum of silence, when
  apparently she listened without comment. It was nearly ten minutes before she
  returned, and her eyes were bright and her cheeks flushed.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind if I told you what I was going to tell you a little
  later?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She had been on the telephone to Sir Gregory: of that Michael was sure,
  though she had not mentioned his name.</p>

  <p>"There's no time like the present, Miss Mendoza," he said encouragingly,
  and she licked her dry lips.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know, but there are reasons why I can't speak now. Would you see
  me tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>"Why, certainly," said Michael, secretly glad of his release.</p>

  <p>"Shall I drive you back?"</p>

  <p>"No, thank you; I can walk."</p>

  <p>"Let me take you to the edge of the town, I'm going that way," she
  begged.</p>

  <p>Of course she was going that way, thought Michael. She was going to Griff
  Towers. He was so satisfied on this matter that he did not even trouble to
  inquire, and when she dropped him at his hotel she hardly waited for him to
  step to the sidewalk before the car leapt forward on its way.</p>

  <p>"There's a telegram for you, sir," said the porter. He went into the
  manager's office and returned with a buff envelope, which Michael tore
  open.</p>

  <p>For a time he could not comprehend the fateful message the telegram
  conveyed. And then slowly he read it to himself.</p>

  <p>A head found on Chobham Common early this morning. Come to Leatherhead
  Police Station at once.</p>

  <p>Staines.</p>

  <p>An hour later a fast car dropped him before the station. Staines was
  waiting on the step.</p>

  <p>"Found at daybreak this morning," he said. "The man is so far
  unknown."</p>

  <p>He led the way to an outhouse. On a table in the centre of the room was a
  box, and he lifted the lid.</p>

  <p>Mike took one glance at the waxen face and turned white.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he breathed.</p>

  <p>It was the head of Lawley Foss.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap23"
     id="chap23">XXIII. CLUES AT THE TOWER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MICHAEL gazed in fascinated horror at the tragic spectacle.
  Then reverently he covered the box with a cloth and walked out into the paved
  courtyard.</p>

  <p>"You know him?" asked Staines.</p>

  <p>Michael nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is Lawley Foss, lately scenario editor of the Knebworth Picture
  Corporation. He was seen alive last night at eleven o'clock. I myself heard,
  if I did not see, him somewhere about that time. He was visiting Griff
  Towers, Sir Gregory Penne's place in Sussex. Was there the usual note?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"There was a note, but it was quite unusual."</p>

  <p>He showed the typewritten slip; it was in the station inspector's office.
  One characteristic line, with its ill-aligned letters.</p>

  <p class="typewriter"
     style="text-align:center">"This is the head of a traitor."</p>

  <p>That and no more.</p>

  <p>"I've had the Dorking police on the 'phone. It was a wet night, and
  although several cars passed none of them could be identified."</p>

  <p>"Has the advertisement appeared?" asked Michael.</p>

  <p>Staines shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, that was the first thing we thought of. The newspapers have been
  carefully observed, and every newspaper manager in the country has promised
  to notify us the moment such an advertisement is inserted. But there has been
  no ad. of any suspicious character."</p>

  <p>"I shall have to follow the line of probability here." said Michael. "It
  is clear that this man was murdered between eleven o'clock and three in the
  morning&mdash;probably nearer eleven than three; for if the murderer is
  located in Sussex, he would have to bring the head to Chobham, leave in it
  the dark and return before it was light."</p>

  <p>His car took Michael back to Chichester at racing pace. Short of the city
  he turned off the main road, his objective being Griff Towers. It was late
  when he arrived, and the Towers presented its usual lifeless appearance. He
  rang the bell, but there was no immediate reply. He rang again, and then the
  voice of Sir Gregory hailed him from one of the upper windows.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?"</p>

  <p>He went out of the porch and looked up. Sir Gregory Penne did not
  recognize him in the darkness, and called again: "Who's there?" and followed
  this with a phrase which Michael guessed was Malayan.</p>

  <p>"It is I, Michael Brixan. I want to see you, Penne."</p>

  <p>"What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Come down and I will tell you."</p>

  <p>"I've gone to bed for the night. See me in the morning."</p>

  <p>"I'll see you now," said Michael firmly. "I have a warrant to search this
  house."</p>

  <p>He had no such warrant, but only because he had not asked for one.</p>

  <p>The man's head was hastily withdrawn, the window slammed down, and such a
  long interval passed that Michael thought that the baronet intended denying
  him admission. This view, however, was wrong. At the end of a dreary period
  of waiting the door was opened, and, in the light of the hall lamp, Sir
  Gregory Penne presented an extraordinary appearance.</p>

  <p>He was fully dressed; around his waist were belted two heavy revolvers,
  but this fact Michael did not immediately notice. The man's head was swathed
  in bandages; only one eye was visible; his left arm was stiff with a surgical
  dressing, and he limped as he walked.</p>

  <p>"I've had an accident," he said gruffly.</p>

  <p>"It looks a pretty bad one," said Michael, observing him narrowly.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to talk here: come into my room," growled the man.</p>

  <p>In Sir Gregory's library there were signs of a struggle. A long mirror
  which hung on one of the walls was shattered to pieces; and, looking up,
  Michael saw that one of the two swords was missing..</p>

  <p>"You've lost something," he said. "Did that occur in the course of the
  'accident'?"</p>

  <p>Sir Gregory nodded.</p>

  <p>Something in the hang of the second sword attracted Michael's attention,
  and, without asking permission, he lifted it down from its hook and drew the
  blade from the scabbard. It was brown with blood.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this?" he asked sternly.</p>

  <p>Sir Gregory swallowed something.</p>

  <p>"A fellow broke into the house last night," he said slowly, "a Malayan
  fellow. He had some cock and bull story about my having carried off his wife.
  He attacked me, and naturally I defended myself."</p>

  <p>"And had you carried off his wife?" asked Michael.</p>

  <p>The baronet shrugged.</p>

  <p>"The idea is absurd. Most of these Borneo folk are mad, and they'll run
  amok on the slightest provocation. I did my best to pacify him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Michael looked at the stained sword.</p>

  <p>"So I see," he said dryly. "And did you&mdash;pacify him?"</p>

  <p>"I defended myself, if that's what you mean. I returned him almost as good
  as he gave. You don't expect me to sit down and be murdered in my own house,
  do you? I can use a sword as well as any man."</p>

  <p>"And apparently you used it," said Michael. "What happened to Foss?"</p>

  <p>Not a muscle of Penne's face moved.</p>

  <p>"Whom do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean Lawley Foss, who was in your house last night."</p>

  <p>"You mean the scenario writer? I haven't seen him for weeks."</p>

  <p>"You're a liar," said Michael calmly. "He was in here last night. I can
  assure you on this point, because I was in the next room."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it was you, was it?" said the baronet, and seemed relieved. "Yes, he
  came to borrow money. I let him have fifty pounds, and he went away, and
  that's the last I saw of him."</p>

  <p>Michael looked at the sword again.</p>

  <p>"Would you be surprised to learn that Foss's head has been picked up on
  Chobham Common?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The other turned a pair of cold, searching eyes upon his interrogator.</p>

  <p>"I should be very much surprised," he said coolly. "If necessary, I have a
  witness to prove that Foss went, though I don't like bringing in a lady's
  name. Miss Stella Mendoza was here, having a bit of supper, as you probably
  know, if it was you in the next room. He left before she did."</p>

  <p>"And he returned," said Michael.</p>

  <p>"I never saw him again, I tell you," said the baronet violently. "If you
  can find anybody who saw him come into this house after his first visit you
  can arrest me. Do you think I killed him?"</p>

  <p>Michael did not answer.</p>

  <p>"There was a woman upstairs in the tower. What has become of her?"</p>

  <p>The other wetted his lips before he replied.</p>

  <p>"The only woman in the tower was a sick servant: she has gone."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see for myself," said Michael.</p>

  <p>Only for a second did the man cast his eyes in the direction of Bhag's
  den, and then:</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "Follow me."</p>

  <p>He went out into the corridor and turned not toward the hall but in the
  opposite direction. Ten paces farther down he stopped and opened a door, so
  cunningly set in the panelling, and so placed between the two shaded lights
  that illuminated the corridor, that it was difficult to detect its presence.
  He put in his hand, turned on a light, and Michael saw a long flight of
  stairs leading back toward the hall.</p>

  <p>As he followed the baronet, he realized that the "tower" was something of
  an illusion. It was only a tower if viewed from the front of the house.
  Otherwise it was an additional two narrow storeys built on one wing of the
  building.</p>

  <p>They passed through a door, up a circular staircase, and came to the
  corridor where Michael had seen Bhag squatting on the previous night.</p>

  <p>"This is the room," said Penne, opening a door.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap24"
     id="chap24">XXIV. THE MARKS OF THE BEAST</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"ON the contrary, it is not the room," said Michael quietly.
  "The room is at the end of the passage."</p>

  <p>The man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Can't you believe me?" he asked in an almost affable tone of voice. "What
  a sceptical chap you are! Now come, Brixan! I don't want to be bad friends
  with you. Let's go down and have a drink and forget our past animosities. I'm
  feeling rotten&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I want to see that room," said Michael.</p>

  <p>"I haven't the key."</p>

  <p>"Then get it," said Michael sharply.</p>

  <p>Eventually the baronet found a pass-key in his pocket, and, with every
  sign of reluctance, he opened the door.</p>

  <p>"She went away in a bit of a hurry," he said. "She was taken so ill that I
  had to get rid of her."</p>

  <p>"If she left here because she was ill she went into an institution of some
  kind, the name of which you will be able to give me," said Michael, as he
  turned on the light.</p>

  <p>One glance at the room told him that the story of her hasty departure may
  have been accurate. But that the circumstances were normal the appearance of
  the room denied. The bed was in confusion; there was blood on the pillow, and
  a dark-brown stain on the wall. A chair was broken; the carpet had odd and
  curious stains, one like the print of a bare foot. On a sheet was an
  indubitable hand-print, but such a hand as no human being had ever
  possessed.</p>

  <p>"The mark of the beast," said Michael, pointing. "That's Bhag!"</p>

  <p>Again the baronet licked his lips.</p>

  <p>"There was a bit of a fight here," he said. "The man came up and pretended
  to identify the servant as his wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What happened to him?"</p>

  <p>There was no reply.</p>

  <p>"What happened to him?" asked Michael with ominous patience.</p>

  <p>"I let him go, and let him take the woman with him. It was
  easier&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With a sudden exclamation, Michael stooped and picked up from behind the
  bed a bright steel object. It was the half of a sword, snapped clean in the
  middle, and unstained. He looked along the blade, and presently found the
  slightest indent. Picking up the chair, he examined the leg and found two
  deeper dents in one of the legs.</p>

  <p>"I'll reconstruct the scene. You and your Bhag caught the man after he had
  got into this room. The chair was broken in the struggle, probably by Bhag,
  who used the chair. The man escaped from the room, ran downstairs into the
  library and got the sword from the wall, then came up after you. That's when
  the real fighting started. I guess some of this blood is yours, Penne."</p>

  <p>"Some of it!" snarled the other. "All of it, damn him!"</p>

  <p>There was a long silence.</p>

  <p>"Did the woman leave this room&mdash;alive?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so," said the other sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Did her husband leave your library&mdash;alive?"</p>

  <p>"You'd better find that out. So far as I know&mdash;I was unconscious for
  half an hour. Bhag can use a sword&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Michael did not leave the house till he had searched it from attic to
  basement. He had every servant assembled and began his interrogation. Each of
  them except one spoke Dutch, but none spoke the language to such purpose that
  they made him any wiser than he had been.</p>

  <p>Going back to the library, he put on all the lights.</p>

  <p>"I'll see Bhag," he said.</p>

  <p>"He's out, I tell you. If you don't believe me&mdash;" Penne went to the
  desk and turned the switch. The door opened and nothing came out.</p>

  <p>A moment's hesitation and Michael had penetrated into the den, a revolver
  in one hand, his lamp in the other. The two rooms were scrupulously clean,
  though a strange animal smell pervaded everything. There was a small bed,
  with sheets and blankets and feather pillow, where the beast slept; a small
  larder full of nuts; a running-water tap (he found afterwards that, in spite
  of his cleverness, Bhag was incapable of turning on or off a faucet); a deep,
  well-worn settee, where the dumb servitor took his rest; and three cricket
  balls, which were apparently the play things of this hideous animal.</p>

  <p>Bhag's method of entering and leaving the house was now apparent. His exit
  was a square opening in the wall, with neither window nor curtain, which was
  situated about seven feet from the ground; and two projecting steel rungs,
  set at intervals between the window and the floor, made a sort of ladder.
  Michael found corresponding rungs on the garden side of the wall.</p>

  <p>There was no sign of blood, no evidence that Bhag had taken any part in
  the terrible scene which must have been enacted the night before.</p>

  <p>Going back to the library, he made a diligent search, but found nothing
  until he went into the little drawing-room where he had hidden the night
  before. Here on the window-sill he found traces enough: the mark of a bare
  foot, and another which suggested that a heavy body had been dragged through
  the window.</p>

  <p>By this time his chauffeur, who, after dropping him at Griff Towers, went
  on to Chichester, had returned with the two police officers, and they
  assisted him in a further search of the grounds. The trail of the fugitive
  was easy to follow: there were bloodstains across the gravel, broken plants
  in a circular flower-bed, the soft loam of which had received the impression
  of those small bare feet. In the vegetable-field the trail was lost.</p>

  <p>"The question is, who carried whom?" said Inspector Lyle, after Michael,
  in a few words, had told him all that he had learnt at the Towers. "It looks
  to me as if these people were killed in the house and, their bodies carried
  away by Bhag. There's no trace of blood in his room, which means no more than
  that in all probability he hasn't been there since the killing," said
  Inspector Lyle. "If we find the monkey we'll solve this little mystery. Penne
  is the Head-Hunter, of course," the inspector went on. "I had a talk with him
  the other day, and there's something fanatical about the man."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure," said Michael slowly, "that you're right. Perhaps my
  ideas are just a little bizarre; but if Sir Gregory Penne is the actual
  murderer, I shall be a very surprised man. I admit," he confessed, "that the
  absence of any footprints in Bhag's quarters staggered me, and probably your
  theory is correct.. There is nothing to be done but to keep the house under
  observation until I communicate with headquarters."</p>

  <p>At this moment the second detective, who had been searching the field to
  its farthermost boundary, came back to say that he had picked up the trail
  again near the postern gate, which was open. They hurried across the field
  and found proof of his discovery. There was a trail both inside and outside
  the gate. Near the postern was a big heap of leaves, which had been left by
  the gardener to rot, and on this they found the impression of a body, as
  though whoever was the carrier had put his burden down for a little while to
  rest. In the field beyond the gate, however, the trail was definitely
  lost.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap25"
     id="chap25">XXV. THE MAN IN THE CAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LIFE is largely made up of little things, but perspective in
  human affairs is not a gift common to youth. It had required a great effort
  on the part of Adele Leamington to ask a man to tea, but once that effort was
  made she had looked forward with a curious pleasure to the function.</p>

  <p>At the moment Michael was speeding to London she interviewed Jack
  Knebworth in his holy of holies.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, my dear: you may take the afternoon off. I am not quite sure
  what the schedule was."</p>

  <p>He reached out his hand for the written time-table, but she supplied the
  information.</p>

  <p>"You wanted some studio portraits of me&mdash;'stills'," she said.</p>

  <p>"So I did! Well, that can wait. Are you feeling pretty confident about the
  picture, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I? No, I'm not confident, Mr. Knebworth; I'm in a state of nerves about
  it. You see, it doesn't seem possible that I should make good at the first
  attempt. One dreams about such things, but in dreams it is easy to jump
  obstacles and get round dangerous corners and slur over difficulties. Every
  time you call 'Camera!' I am in a state of panic, and I am so self-conscious
  that I am watching every movement I take, and saying to myself, 'You're
  raising your hands awkwardly; you're turning your head with a jerk.'"</p>

  <p>"But that doesn't last?" he said sharply, so sharply that she smiled.</p>

  <p>"No: the moment I hear the camera turning, I feel that I am the character
  I'm supposed to be."</p>

  <p>He patted her on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"That is how you should feel," he said, and went on: "Seen nothing of
  Mendoza, have you? She isn't annoying you? Or Foss?"</p>

  <p>"I've not seen Miss Mendoza for days&mdash;but I saw Mr. Foss last
  night."</p>

  <p>She did not explain the curious circumstances, and John Knebworth was so
  incurious that he did not ask. So that he learnt nothing of Lawley Foss's
  mysterious interview with the man in the closed car at the corner of Arundel
  Road, an incident she had witnessed on the previous night. Nor of the white
  and womanly hand that had waved him farewell, nor of the great diamond which
  had sparkled lustrously on the little finger of the unknown motorist.</p>

  <p>Going home, Adele stopped at a confectioner's and a florist's, collecting
  the cakes and flowers that were to adorn the table of Mrs. Watson's parlour.
  She wondered more than a little just what attraction she offered to this man
  of affairs. She had a trick of getting outside and examining herself with an
  impartial eye, and she knew that, by self-repression and almost
  self-obliteration, she had succeeded in making of Adele Leamington a very
  colourless, characterless young lady. That she was pretty she knew, but
  prettiness in itself attracts only the superficial. Men who are worth knowing
  require something more than beauty. And Michael was not philandering&mdash;he
  was not that kind. He wanted her for a friend at least: she had no thought
  that he desired amusement during his enforced stay in a very dull town.</p>

  <p>Half past four came and found the girl waiting. At a quarter to five she
  was at the door, scanning the street. At five, angry but philosophical, she
  had her tea and ordered the little maid-of-all-work to clear the table.</p>

  <p>Michael had forgotten!</p>

  <p>Of course, she made excuses for him, only to demolish them and build
  again. She was hurt, amused and hurt again. Going upstairs to her room, she
  lit the gas, took the script from her bag and tried to study the scenes that
  were to be shot on the following day, but all manner of distractions
  interposed between her receptive mind and the typewritten paper. Michael
  bulked largely, and the closed car, and Lawley Foss, and that waving white
  hand as the car drove off. Curiously enough, her speculations came back again
  and again to the car. It was new, and its woodwork was highly polished, and
  it moved so noiselessly.</p>

  <p>At last she threw the manuscript down and rose, with a doubtful eye on the
  bed. She was not tired; the hour was nine. Chichester offered few attractions
  by night. There were two cinemas, but she was not in the mood for cinemas.
  She put on her hat and went down, calling en route at the kitchen door.</p>

  <p>"I am going out for a quarter of an hour," she told her landlady, who was
  in an approving mood.</p>

  <p>The house was situate in a street of small villas. It was economically
  illuminated, and there were dark patches where the light of the street lamps
  scarcely reached. In one of these a motor-car was standing&mdash;she saw the
  bulk of it before she identified its character. She wondered if the owner
  knew that its tail-light was extinguished. As she came up to the machine she
  identified the car she had seen on the previous night&mdash;Foss had spoken
  to its occupant.</p>

  <p>Glancing to the left, she could see nothing of its interior. The blinds on
  the road side were drawn, and she thought it was empty, and then...</p>

  <p>"Pretty lady&mdash;come with me!"</p>

  <p>The voice was a whisper: she caught the flash and sparkle of a precious
  stone; saw the white hand on the edge of the half-closed window, and, in a
  fit of unreasoning terror, hurried forward.</p>

  <p>She heard a whirr of electric starter and the purring of engines. The
  machine was following her, and she broke into a run. At the corner of the
  street she saw a man and flew toward him as she made out the helmet of a
  policeman.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, miss?"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the car flashed past, spun round the corner and was out of
  sight instantly.</p>

  <p>"A man spoke to me&mdash;in that car!" she said breathlessly.</p>

  <p>The stolid constable gazed vacantly at the place where the car had
  been.</p>

  <p>"He didn't have lights," he said stupidly. "I ought to have taken his
  number. Did he insult you, miss?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, for she was already ashamed of her fears.</p>

  <p>"I'm nervy, officer," she said with a smile. "I don't think I will go any
  farther."</p>

  <p>She tuned back and hurried to her lodgings. There were disadvantages in
  starring&mdash;even on Jack Knebworth's modest lot, it was nervous work, she
  thought.</p>

  <p>She went to sleep that night and dreamt that the man in the car was
  Michael Brixan and he wanted her to come in to tea.</p>

  <p>It was past midnight when Michael rang up Jack Knebworth with the
  news.</p>

  <p>"Foss!" he gasped. "Good God! You don't mean that, Brixan? Shall I come
  round and see you?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come to you," said Michael. "There are one or two things I want to
  know about the man, and it will create less of a fuss than if I have to admit
  you to the hotel."</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth rented a house on the Arundel Road, and he was waiting at
  the garden door to admit his visitor when Michael arrived.</p>

  <p>Michael told the story of the discovery of the head, and felt that he
  might so far take the director into his confidence as to retail his visit to
  Sir Gregory Penne.</p>

  <p>"That beats everything." said Jack in a hushed tone. "Poor old Foss! You
  think that Penne did this? But why? You don't cut up a man because he wants
  to borrow money."</p>

  <p>"My views have been switching round a little," said Michael. "You remember
  a sheet of manuscript that was found amongst some of your script, and which I
  told you must have been written by the Head Hunter?"</p>

  <p>Jack nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm perfectly sure," Michael went on, "and particularly after seeing the
  erasure in the scenario book, that Foss knew who was the author of that
  manuscript, and I'm equally certain that he resolved upon the desperate
  expedient of blackmailing the writer. If that is the case, and if Sir Gregory
  is the man&mdash;again I am very uncertain on this point &mdash;there is a
  good reason why he should be put out of the way. There is one person who can
  help us, and that is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mendoza," said Jack, and the two men's eyes met.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap26"
     id="chap26">XXVI. THE HAND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JACK looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I guess she'll be in bed by now, but it's worthwhile trying. Would you
  like to see her?"</p>

  <p>Michael hesitated. Stella Mendoza was a friend of Penne's, and he was
  loath to commit himself irretrievably to the view that Penne was the
  murderer.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think we'll see her," he said. "After all, Penne knows that he is
  suspected."</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth was ten minutes on the telephone before he succeeded in
  getting a reply from Stella's cottage.</p>

  <p>"It's Knebworth speaking, Miss Mendoza," he said. "Is it possible to see
  you tonight? Mr. Brixan wants to speak to you."</p>

  <p>"At this hour of the night?" she said in sleepy surprise. "I was in bed
  when the bell rang. Won't it do in the morning?"</p>

  <p>"No, he wants to see you particularly tonight. I'll come along with him if
  you don't mind."</p>

  <p>"What is wrong?" she asked quickly. "Is it about Gregory?"</p>

  <p>Jack whispered a query to the man who stood at his side, and Michael
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is about Gregory," said Knebworth.</p>

  <p>"Will you come along? I'll have time to dress." Stella was dressed by the
  time they arrived, and too curious and too alarmed to make the hour of the
  call a matter of comment.</p>

  <p>"What is the trouble?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Foss is dead."</p>

  <p>"Dead?" She opened her eyes wide. "Why, I only saw him yesterday. But
  how?"</p>

  <p>"He has been murdered," said Michael quietly. "His head has been found on
  Chobham Common."</p>

  <p>She would have fallen to the floor had not Michael's arm been there to
  support her, and it was some time before she recovered sufficiently to answer
  coherently the questions which were put to her.</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't see Mr. Foss again after he left the Towers, and then I only
  saw him for a few seconds."</p>

  <p>"Did he suggest he was coming back again?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Did Sir Gregory tell you he was returning?"</p>

  <p>"No." She shook her head again. "He told me he was glad to see the last of
  him, and that he had borrowed fifty pounds until next week, when he expected
  to make a lot of money. Gregory is like that&mdash;he will tell you things
  about people, things which they ask him not to make public. He is rather
  proud of his wealth and what he calls his charity."</p>

  <p>"You had a luncheon engagement with him?" said Michael, watching her.</p>

  <p>She bit her lip.</p>

  <p>"You must have heard me talking when I left him," she said. "No, I had no
  luncheon engagement. That was camouflage, intended for anybody who was
  hanging around, and we knew somebody had been in the house that night. Was it
  you?"</p>

  <p>Michael nodded.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm so relieved!" She heaved a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>"Those few minutes in that dark room were terrible to me. I thought it
  was&mdash;" She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Bhag?" suggested Michael, and she nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You don't suspect Gregory of killing Foss?"</p>

  <p>"I suspect everybody in general and nobody in particular," said Michael.
  "Did you see Bhag?"</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>"No, not that time. I've seen him, of course. He gives me the creeps! I've
  never seen anything so human. Sometimes, when Gregory was a little&mdash;a
  little drunk, he used to bring Bhag out and make him do tricks. Do you know
  that Bhag could do all the Malayan exercises with the sword? Sir Gregory had
  a specially made wooden sword for him, and the way that that awful thing used
  to twirl it round his head was terrifying."</p>

  <p>Michael stared at her.</p>

  <p>"Bhag could use the sword, then? Penne told me he did, but I thought he
  was lying."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, he could use the sword. Gregory taught him everything."</p>

  <p>"What is Penne to you?" Michael asked the question bluntly, and she
  coloured.</p>

  <p>"He has been a friend," she said awkwardly, "a very good friend of
  mine&mdash;financially, I mean. He took a liking to me a long time ago, and
  we've been&mdash;very good friends."</p>

  <p>Michael nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you are still?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered shortly. "I've finished with Gregory, and am leaving
  Chichester tomorrow. I've put the house in an agent's hands to rent. Poor Mr.
  Foss!" she said, and there were tears in her eyes. "Poor soul! Gregory
  wouldn't have done it, Mr. Brixan, I'll swear that! There's a whole lot of
  Gregory that's sheer bluff. He's a coward at heart, and though he has done
  dreadful things, he has always had an agent to do the dirty work."</p>

  <p>"Dreadful things like what?"</p>

  <p>She seemed reluctant to explain, but he pressed her. "Well, he told me
  that he used to take expeditions in the bush and raid the villages, carrying
  off girls. There is one tribe that have very beautiful women. Perhaps he was
  lying about that too, but I have an idea that he spoke the truth. He told me
  that only a year ago, when he was in Borneo, he 'lifted' a girl from a wild
  village where it was death for a European to go. He always said
  'lifted'."</p>

  <p>"And didn't you mind these confessions?" asked Michael, his steely eye
  upon her.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"He was that kind of man," was all she said, and it spoke volumes for her
  understanding of her "very good friend".</p>

  <p>Michael walked back to Jack Knebworth's house.</p>

  <p>"The story Penne tells seems to fit together with the information Mendoza
  has given us. There is no doubt that the woman at the top of the tower was
  the lady he 'lifted', and less doubt that the little brown man was her
  husband. If they have escaped from the tower, then there should be no
  difficulty in finding them. I'll send out a message to all stations within a
  radius of twenty-five miles, and we ought to get news of them in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"It's morning, now," said Jack, looking towards the greying east. "Will
  you come in? I'll give you some coffee. This news has upset me. I was going
  to have a long day's work, but I guess we'll have to put it off for a day or
  so. The company is bound to be upset by this news. They all knew Foss,
  although he was not very popular with them. It only wants Adele to be off
  colour to complete our misery. By the way, Brixan, why don't you make this
  your headquarters? I'm a bachelor; there's a 'phone service here, and you'll
  get a privacy at this house which you don't get at your hotel."</p>

  <p>The idea appealed to the detective, and it was at Jack Knebworth's house
  that he slept that night, after an hour's conversation on the telephone with
  Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning he was again at the Towers, and now, with the
  assistance of daylight, he enlarged his search, without adding greatly to his
  knowledge. The position was a peculiar one, as Scotland Yard had emphasized.
  Sir Gregory Penne was a member of a good family, a rich man, a justice of the
  peace; and, whilst his eccentricities were of a lawless character, "You can't
  hang people for being queer," the Commissioner informed Michael on the
  telephone.</p>

  <p>It was a suspicious fact that Bhag had disappeared as completely as the
  brown man and his wife.</p>

  <p>"He hasn't been back all night: I've seen nothing of him," said Sir
  Gregory. "And that's not the first time he's gone off on his own. He finds
  hiding-places that you'd never suspect, and he's probably gone to earth
  somewhere. He'll turn up."</p>

  <p>Michael was passing through Chichester when he saw a figure that made him
  bring the car to a standstill with such a jerk that it was a wonder the tyres
  did not burst. In a second he was out of the machine and walking to meet
  Adele.</p>

  <p>"It seems ten thousand years since I saw you," he said with an
  extravagance which at any other time would have brought a smile to her
  face.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't stop. I'm on my way to the studio," she said, a little
  coldly, "and I promised Mr. Knebworth that I would be there early. You see, I
  got off yesterday afternoon by telling Mr. Knebworth that I had an
  engagement."</p>

  <p>"And had you?" asked the innocent Michael.</p>

  <p>"I asked somebody to take tea with me"; and his jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"Moses!" he gasped. "I am the villain!"</p>

  <p>She would have gone on, but he stopped her.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to shock you or hurt you, Adele," he said gently "but the
  explanation for my forgetfulness is that we've had another tragedy."</p>

  <p>She stopped and looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Another?" He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Foss has been murdered," he said. She went very white.</p>

  <p>"When?" Her voice was calm, almost emotionless.</p>

  <p>"Last night."</p>

  <p>"It was after nine," she said.</p>

  <p>His eyebrows went up in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Because, Mr. Brixan"&mdash;she spoke slowly&mdash;"at nine o'clock I saw
  the hand of the man who murdered him!</p>

  <p>"Two nights ago," she went on, "I went out to buy some wool I wanted. It
  was just before the shops closed&mdash;a quarter to eight, I think. In the
  town I saw Mr. Foss and spoke to him. He was very nervous and restless, and
  again made a suggestion to me which he had already made when he called on me.
  His manner was so strange that I asked him if he was in any trouble. He told
  me no, but he had had an awful premonition that something dreadful was going
  to happen, and he asked me if I'd lived in Chichester for any length of time,
  and if I knew about the caves."</p>

  <p>"The caves?" said Michael quickly.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was surprised. I'd never heard of the caves. He told me there was a
  reference to them in some old history of Chichester. He had looked in the
  guide books without finding anything about them, but apparently there were
  caves at some time or other near Chellerton, but there was a heavy subsidence
  of earth that closed the entrance. He was so rambling and so disjointed that
  I thought he must have been drinking, and I was glad to get away from him. I
  went on and did my shopping and met one of the extra girls I knew. She asked
  me to go home with her. I didn't want to go a bit, but I thought if I refused
  she would think I was giving myself airs, and so I went. As soon as I could,
  I came away and went straight home.</p>

  <p>"It was then nine o'clock and the streets were empty. They are not very
  well lit in Chichester, but I was able to recognize Mr. Foss. He was standing
  at the corner of the Arundel Road, and was evidently waiting for somebody. I
  stopped because I particularly did not wish to meet Mr. Foss, but I was on
  the point of turning round when a car drove into the road and stopped almost
  opposite him."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a car?" asked Michael.</p>

  <p>"It was a closed landaulette&mdash;I think they call them sedans. As it
  came round the corner its lights went out, which struck me as being curious.
  Mr. Foss was evidently waiting for this, for he went up and leant on the edge
  of the window and spoke to somebody inside. I don't know what made me do it,
  but I had an extraordinary impulse to see who was in the car, and I started
  walking toward them. I must have been five or six yards away when Mr. Foss
  stepped back and the sedan moved on. The driver put his hand out of the
  window as if he was waving good-bye. It was still out of the window and the
  only thing visible&mdash;the interior was quite dark &mdash;when it came
  abreast of me."</p>

  <p>"Was there anything peculiar about the hand?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except that it was small and white, and on the little finger was
  a large diamond ring. The fire in it was extraordinary, and I wondered why a
  man should wear a ring of that kind. You will think I am silly, but the sight
  of that hand gave me a terrible feeling of fear &mdash;I don't know why, even
  now. There was something unnatural and abnormal about it. When I looked round
  again, Mr. Foss was walking rapidly in the other direction, and I made no
  attempt to overtake him."</p>

  <p>"You saw no number on the car?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever." She shook her head. "I wasn't so curious."</p>

  <p>"You didn't even see the silhouette of the man inside?"</p>

  <p>"No, I saw nothing. His arm was raised."</p>

  <p>"What size was the diamond, do you think?"</p>

  <p>She pursed her lips dubiously.</p>

  <p>"He passed me in a flash, and I can't give you any very accurate
  information, Mr. Brixan. It may be a mistake on my part, but I thought it was
  as big as the tip of my finger. Naturally I couldn't see any details, even
  though I saw the car again last night."</p>

  <p>She went on to tell him of what happened on the previous night, and he
  listened intently.</p>

  <p>"The man spoke to you&mdash;did you recognize his voice?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;he spoke in a whisper. I did not see his face, though I have an
  idea that he was wearing a cap. The policeman said he should have taken the
  number of the car."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the policeman said that, did he?" remarked Michael sardonically.
  "Well, there's hope for him."</p>

  <p>For a minute he was immersed in thought, and then:</p>

  <p>"I'll take you to the studio, if you don't mind," said Michael.</p>

  <p>He left her to go to her dressing-room, there to learn that work had been
  suspended for the day, and went in search of Jack.</p>

  <p>"You've seen everybody of consequence in this neighbourhood," he said. "Do
  you know anyone who drives a sedan and wears a diamond ring on the little
  finger of the right hand?"</p>

  <p>"The only person I know who has that weakness is Mendoza," he said.</p>

  <p>Michael whistled.</p>

  <p>"I never thought of Mendoza," he said, "and Adele described the hand as
  'small and womanly'."</p>

  <p>"Mendoza's hand isn't particularly small, but it would look small on a
  man," said Jack thoughtfully. "And her car isn't a closed sedan, but that
  doesn't mean anything. By the way, I've just sent instructions to tell the
  company I'm working today. If we let these people stand around thinking,
  they'll get thoroughly upset."</p>

  <p>"I thought that too," said Michael with a smile, "but I didn't dare make
  the suggestion."</p>

  <p>An urgent message took him to London that afternoon, where he attended a
  conference of the Big Five at Scotland Yard. And at the end of the two-hour
  discussion the conclusion was reached that Sir Gregory Penne was to remain at
  large but under observation.</p>

  <p>"We verified the story about the lifting of this girl in Borneo," said the
  quiet-spoken Chief, "and all the facts dovetail. I haven't the slightest
  doubt in my mind that Penne is the culprit, but we've got to walk very
  warily. I dare say in your department, Captain Brixan, you can afford to take
  a few risks, but the police in this country never make an arrest for murder
  unless they are absolutely certain that a conviction will follow. There may
  be something in your other theory, and I'd be the last man in the world to
  turn it down, but you'll have to conduct parallel investigations."</p>

  <p>Michael ran down to Sussex in broad daylight. There was a long stretch of
  road about four miles north of Chichester, and he was pelting along this when
  he became suddenly aware of a figure standing in the middle of the roadway
  with its arms outstretched, and slowed down. It was Mr. Sampson Longvale, he
  saw to his amazement. Almost before the car had stopped, with an
  extraordinary display of agility Mr. Longvale jumped on the
  running-board.</p>

  <p>"I have been watching for you this last two hours, Mr. Brixan," he said.
  "Do you mind if I join you?"</p>

  <p>"Come right in," said Michael heartily.</p>

  <p>"You are going to Chichester, I know. Would you mind instead coming to the
  Dower House? I have something important to tell you."</p>

  <p>The place at which he had signalled the car to stop was exactly opposite
  the end of the road that led to the Dower House and Sir Gregory's domain. The
  old man told him that he had walked back from Chichester, and had been
  waiting for the passing of the car.</p>

  <p>"I learnt for the first time, Mr. Brixan, that you are an officer of the
  law," he said, with a stately inclination of his head. "I need hardly tell
  you how greatly I respect one whose duty it is to serve the cause of
  justice."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Knebworth told you, I presume?" said Michael, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"He told me," agreed the other gravely. "I went in really to seek you,
  having an intuition that you had some more important position in life than
  what I had first imagined. I confess I thought at first that you were one of
  those idle young men who have nothing to do but to amuse themselves. It was a
  great gratification to me to learn that I was mistaken. It is all the more
  gratifying"&mdash;Michael smiled inwardly at the verbosity of
  age&mdash;"because I need advice on a point of law which I imagine my lawyer
  would not offer to me. My position is a very peculiar one, in some ways
  embarrassing. I am a man who shrinks from the eye of the public and am averse
  from vulgar intermeddling in other people's affairs."</p>

  <p>What had he to tell? Michael wondered&mdash;this old man, with his habit
  of nocturnal strolls might have been a witness to something that had not yet
  come out.</p>

  <p>They stopped at the Dower House, and the old man got out and opened the
  gate, not closing it until Michael had passed through. Instead of going
  direct to his sitting-room, he went upstairs, beckoning Michael to come
  after, and stopped before the room which had been occupied by Adele on the
  night of her terrible experience.</p>

  <p>"I wish you to see these people," said Mr. Longvale earnestly, "and tell
  me whether I am acting in accordance with the law."</p>

  <p>He opened the door, and Mike saw that there were now two beds in the room.
  On one, heavily bandaged and apparently unconscious, was the brown-faced man;
  on the other, sleeping, was the woman Michael had seen in the tower. She too
  was badly wounded: her arm was bandaged and strapped into position. Michael
  drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"That is a mystery solved, anyway," he said. "Where did you find these
  people?"</p>

  <p>At the sound of his voice the woman opened her eyes and frowned at him
  fearfully, then looked across to the man.</p>

  <p>"You have been wounded?" said Michael in Dutch; but apparently her
  education had been neglected in respect of European languages, for she made
  no reply.</p>

  <p>She was so uncomfortable at the sight of him that Michael was glad to go
  out of the room. It was not until they were back in his sanctum that Mr.
  Longvale told his story.</p>

  <p>"I saw them last night about half past eleven," he said. "They were
  staggering down the road, and I thought at first that they were intoxicated,
  but fortunately the woman spoke, and as I have never forgotten a voice, even
  when it spoke in a language that was unfamiliar to me, I realized immediately
  that it was my patient, and went out to intercept her. I then saw the
  condition of her companion, and she, recognizing me, began to speak excitedly
  in a language which I could not understand, though I would have been
  singularly dense if I had had any doubt as to her meaning. The man was on the
  point of collapse, but, assisted by the woman, I managed to get him into the
  house and to the room where he now is. Fortunately, in the expectation of
  again being called to attend her, I had purchased a small stock of surgical
  dressing and was able to attend to the man."</p>

  <p>"Is he badly hurt?" asked Michael,</p>

  <p>"He has lost a considerable quantity of blood," said the other, "and,
  though there seem to be no arteries severed or bones broken, the wounds have
  an alarming appearance. Now, it has occurred to me," he went on, in his oddly
  profound manner, "that this unfortunate native could not have received his
  injury except as the result of some illegal act, and I thought the best thing
  to do was to notify the police that they were under my care. I called first
  upon my excellent friend Mr. Jack Knebworth, and opened my heart to him. He
  then told me your position, and I decided to await your return before I took
  any further steps."</p>

  <p>"You have solved a mystery that has puzzled me, and, incidentally, you
  have confirmed a story which I had received with considerable scepticism,"
  said Mike. "I think you were well advised in informing the police&mdash;I
  will make a report to headquarters and send an ambulance to take these two
  people to hospital. Is the man fit to be moved?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," nodded the old gentleman. "He is sleeping heavily now, and
  has the appearance of being in a state of coma, but that is not the case.
  They are quite welcome to stay here, though I have no convenience, and must
  do my own nursing, which is rather a bother, for I am not fitted for such a
  strain. Happily, the woman is able to do a great deal for him."</p>

  <p>"Did he have a sword when he arrived?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Longvale clicked his lips impatiently.</p>

  <p>"How stupid of me to forget that! Yes, it is in here."</p>

  <p>He went to a drawer in an old-fashioned bureau, pulled it open and took
  out the identical sword which Michael had seen hanging above the mantelpiece
  at Grill Towers. It was spotlessly clean, and had been so when Mr. Longvale
  took it from the brown man's hands. And yet he did not expect it to be in any
  other condition, for to the swordsman of the East his sword is his child, and
  probably the brown man's first care had been to wipe it clean.</p>

  <p>Michael was taking his leave when he suddenly asked:</p>

  <p>"I wonder if it would give you too much trouble, Mr. Longvale, to get me a
  glass of water? My throat is parched."</p>

  <p>With an exclamation of apology, the old man hurried away, leaving Michael
  in the hall.</p>

  <p>Hanging on pegs was the long overcoat of the master of Dower House, and
  beside it the curly-rimmed beaver and a very prosaic derby hat, which Michael
  took down the moment the old man's back was turned. It had been no ruse of
  his, this demand for a drink, for he was parched. Only Michael had the
  inquisitiveness of his profession.</p>

  <p>The old gentleman returned quickly, to find Michael examining the hat.</p>

  <p>"Where did this come from?" asked the detective.</p>

  <p>"That was the hat the native was wearing when he arrived," said Mr.
  Longvale.</p>

  <p>"I will take it with me, if you don't mind," said Michael after a long
  silence.</p>

  <p>"With all the pleasure in life. Our friend upstairs will not need a hat
  for a very long time," he said, with a whimsical little smile.</p>

  <p>Michael went back to his car, put the hat carefully beside him, and drove
  into Chichester; and all the way he was in a state of wonder. For inside the
  hat were the initials "L. F.". How came the hat of Lawley Foss on the head of
  the brown man from Borneo?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap27"
     id="chap27">XXVII. THE CAVES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. LONGVALE'S two patients were removed to hospital that
  night, and, with a favourable report on the man's condition from the doctors,
  Michael felt that one aspect of the mystery was a mystery no longer.</p>

  <p>His old schoolmaster received a visit that night.</p>

  <p>"More study?" he asked good-humouredly when Michael was announced.</p>

  <p>"Curiously enough, you're right, sir," said Michael, "though I doubt very
  much whether you can assist me. I'm looking for an old history of
  Chichester."</p>

  <p>"I have one published in 1600. You're the second man in the last fortnight
  who wanted to see it."</p>

  <p>"Who was the other?" asked Michael quickly.</p>

  <p>"A man named Foss&mdash;" began Mr. Scott, and Michael nodded as though he
  had known the identity of the seeker after knowledge. "He wanted to know
  about caves. I've never heard there were any local caves of any celebrity.
  Now, if this were Cheddar, I should be able to give you quite a lot of
  information. I am an authority on the Cheddar caves."</p>

  <p>He showed Michael into the library, and, taking down an ancient volume,
  laid it on the library table.</p>

  <p>"After Foss had gone I looked up the reference. I find it occurs only on
  one page&mdash;385. It deals with the disappearance of a troop of horsemen
  under Sir John Dudley, Earl of Newport, in some local trouble in the days of
  Stephen. Here is the passage." He pointed.</p>

  <p>Michael read, in the old-fashioned type:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0501081h-images/TheAvenger-1.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"Have the caves ever been located?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Scott shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There are local rumours that they were used a century and a half ago by
  brandy-smugglers, but then you find those traditions local to every
  district."</p>

  <p>Michael took a local map of Chichester from his pocket, measured off nine
  miles, and with a pair of compasses encircled the city. He noted that the
  line passed either through or near Sir Gregory's estate.</p>

  <p>"There are two Griff Towers," he suddenly said, examining the map.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is another besides Penne's place, which is named after a
  famous local landmark&mdash;the real Griffin Tower (as it was originally
  called). I have an idea it stands either within or about Penne's property
  &mdash;a very old, circular tower, about twenty feet high, and anything up to
  two thousand years old. I'm interested in antiquities, and I have made a very
  careful inspection of the place. The lower part of the wall is undoubtedly
  Roman work&mdash;the Romans had a big encampment here; in fact, Regnum was
  one of their headquarters. There are all sorts of explanations for the tower.
  Probably it was a keep or blockhouse. The idea I have is that the original
  Roman tower was not more than a few feet high and was not designed for
  defence at all. Successive ages added to its height, without exactly knowing
  why."</p>

  <p>Michael chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Now, if my theory is correct, I shall hear more about this Roman castle
  before the night is out," he said.</p>

  <p>He gathered his trunks from the hotel and took them off to his new home.
  He found that the dinner-table was laid for three.</p>

  <p>"Expecting company?" asked Michael, watching Jack Knebworth putting the
  finishing touches on the table&mdash;he had a bachelor's finicking sense of
  neatness which consists of placing everything at equal distance from
  everything else.</p>

  <p>"Yuh! Friend of yours."</p>

  <p>"Of mine?"</p>

  <p>Jack nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've asked young Leamington to come up. And when I see a man of your age
  turning pink at the mention of a girl's name, I feel sorry for him. She's
  coming partly on business, partly for the pleasure of meeting me in a human
  atmosphere. She didn't do so well today as I wanted, but I guess we were all
  a little short of our best."</p>

  <p>She came soon after and there was something about her that was very sweet
  and appealing&mdash;something that went straight to Michael's heart and
  consolidated the position she had taken there.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking as I came along," she said, as Jack Knebworth helped her
  off with her coat, "how very unreal everything is&mdash;I never dreamt I
  should be your guest to dinner, Mr. Knebworth."</p>

  <p>"And I never dreamt you'd be worthy of such a distinction," growled Jack.
  "And in five years' time you'll be saying, 'Why on earth did I make such a
  fuss about being asked to a skimpy meal by that punk director
  Knebworth?'"</p>

  <p>He put his hand on her shoulder and led her into the room, and then for
  the first time she saw Michael, and that young man had a momentary sense of
  dismay when he saw her face drop. It was only for a second, and, as if
  reading his thoughts, she explained her sudden change of mien.</p>

  <p>"I thought we were going to talk nothing but pictures and pictures!" she
  said.</p>

  <p>"So you shall," said Michael. "I'm the best listener on earth, and the
  first person to mention murder will be thrown out of the window."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll prepare for the flight!" she said good humouredly. "For I'm
  going to talk murder and mystery&mdash;later!"</p>

  <p>Under the expanding influence of a sympathetic environment the girl took
  on a new aspect, and all that Michael had suspected in her was amply proven.
  The shyness, the almost frigid reserve, melted in the company of two men, one
  of whom she guessed was fond of her, while the other&mdash;well, Michael was
  at least a friend.</p>

  <p>"I have been doing detective-work this afternoon," she said, after the
  coffee had been served, "and I've made amazing discoveries," she added
  solemnly. "It started by my trying to track the motor-car, which I guessed
  must have come into my street through a lane which runs across the far end.
  It is the only motor-car track I've found, and I don't think there is any
  doubt it was my white-handed man who drove it. You see, I noticed the back
  tyre, which had a sort of diamond-shaped design on it, and it was fairly easy
  to follow the marks. Hall-way up the lane I found a place where there was oil
  in the middle of the road and where the car must have stood for some time,
  and there&mdash;I found this!"</p>

  <p>She opened her little handbag and took out a small dark-green bottle. It
  bore no label and was unstoppered. Michael took it from her hand, examined it
  curiously and smelt. There was a distinctive odour, pungent and not
  unpleasing.</p>

  <p>"Do you recognize it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Let me try." Jack Knebworth took the bottle from Michael's hand and
  sniffed. "Butyl chloride," he said quickly, and the girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was that. Father was a pharmaceutical chemist, and once,
  when I was playing in his dispensary, I found a cupboard open and took down a
  pretty bottle and opened it. I don't know what would have happened to me,
  only daddy saw me. I was quite a child at the time, and I've always
  remembered that scent."</p>

  <p>"Butyl chloride?" Michael frowned.</p>

  <p>"It's known as the 'death drop' or the 'knock-out drop'," said Knebworth,
  "and it's a drug very much in favour with sharks who make a business of
  robbing sailors. A few drops of that in a glass of wine and you're out!"</p>

  <p>Michael took the bottle again. It was a commonplace bottle such as is used
  for dispensing poisons, and in fact the word "poison" was blown into the
  glass.</p>

  <p>"There is no trace of a label." he said.</p>

  <p>"And really there is no connection with the mysterious car," admitted the
  girl. "My surmise is merely guesswork&mdash;putting one sinister thing to
  another."</p>

  <p>"Where was it?"</p>

  <p>"In a ditch, which is very deep there and is flooded just now, but the
  bottle didn't roll down so far as the water. That is discovery number one.
  Here is number two."</p>

  <p>From her bag she took a curious-shaped piece of steel, both ends of which
  had the marks of a break.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what that is?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It beats me," said Jack, and handed the find to Michael.</p>

  <p>"I know what it is, because I've seen it at the studio," said the girl,
  "and you know too, don't you, Mr. Brixan?"</p>

  <p>Mike nodded.</p>

  <p>"It's the central link of a handcuff," he said&mdash;"the link that has
  the swivel."</p>

  <p>It was covered with spots of rust, which had been cleaned off &mdash;by
  the girl, as she told him.</p>

  <p>"Those are my two finds. I am not going to offer you my conclusions,
  because I have none."</p>

  <p>"They may not have been thrown from the car at all," said Michael, "but,
  as you say, there is a possibility that the owner of the car chose that
  peculiarly deserted spot to rid himself of two articles which he could not
  afford to have on the premises. It would have been safer to throw them into
  the sea, but this, I suppose, was the easier, and, to him, the safer, method.
  I will keep these."</p>

  <p>He wrapped them in paper, put them away in his pocket, and the
  conversation drifted back to picture-taking, and, as he had anticipated:</p>

  <p>"We're shooting at Griff Tower tomorrow&mdash;the real tower," said Jack
  Knebworth. "It is one of the landmarks&mdash;what is there amusing in Griff
  Tower?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing particularly amusing, except that you have fulfilled a prediction
  of mine," said Michael. "I knew I should hear of that darned old tower!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap28"
     id="chap28">XXVIII. THE TOWER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MICHAEL was a little perturbed in mind. He took a more
  serious view of the closed car than did the girl, and the invitation to the
  "pretty lady" to step inside was particularly disturbing. Since the events of
  the past few days it had been necessary to withdraw the detective who was
  watching the girl's house, and he decided to re-establish the guard,
  employing a local officer for the purpose.</p>

  <p>After he had driven Adele home, he went to the police station and made his
  wishes known; but it was too late to see the chief constable and the
  subordinate officer in charge did not wish to take the responsibility of
  detaching an officer for the purpose. It was only when Michael threatened to
  call the chief on the telephone that he reluctantly drew on his reserves and
  put a uniformed officer to patrol the street.</p>

  <p>Back again at Knebworth's house, Michael examined the two articles which
  the girl had found. Butyl chloride was a drug, and a particularly violent
  one. What use would the Head-Hunter have for that? he wondered.</p>

  <p>As for the handcuff, he examined it again. Terrific force must have been
  employed to snap the connecting-links. This was a mystery to him, and he gave
  it up with a sense of annoyance at his own incompetence.</p>

  <p>Before going to bed he received a 'phone message from Inspector Lyle, who
  was watching Griff Towers. There was nothing new to report, and apparently
  life was pursuing its normal round. The inspector had been invited into the
  house by Sir Gregory, who had told him that Bhag was still missing.</p>

  <p>"I'll keep you there tonight," said Michael. "Tomorrow we will lift the
  watch. Scotland Yard is satisfied that Sir Gregory had nothing to do with
  Foss's death."</p>

  <p>A grunt from the other end of the 'phone expressed the inspector's
  disagreement with that view.</p>

  <p>"He's in it somehow," he said. "By the way, I've found a blood-stained
  derby hat in the field outside the grounds. It has the name of Chi Li Stores,
  Tjandi, inside."</p>

  <p>This was news indeed.</p>

  <p>"Let me see it in the morning," said Michael after long cogitation.</p>

  <p>Soon after breakfast the next morning the hat came and was inspected.
  Knebworth, who had heard most of the story from Michael, examined the new
  clue curiously.</p>

  <p>"If the coon wore Lawley's hat when he arrived at Mr. Longvale's, where,
  in the name of fate, did the change take place? It must have been somewhere
  between the Towers and the old man's house, unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Unless what?" asked Michael. He had a great respect for Knebworth's
  shrewd judgment.</p>

  <p>"Unless the change took place at Sir Gregory's house. You see that,
  although it is blood-stained, there are no cuts in it. Which is rum."</p>

  <p>"Very rum," agreed Mike ruefully. "And yet, if my first theory was
  correct, the explanation is simple."</p>

  <p>He did not tell his host what his theory was.</p>

  <p>Accompanying Knebworth to the studio, he watched the char-à-banc drive
  off, wishing that he had some excuse and the leisure to accompany them on
  their expedition. It was a care-free, cheery throng, and its very association
  was a tonic to his spirits.</p>

  <p>He put through his usual call to London. There was no news. There was
  really no reason why he should not go, he decided recklessly, and as soon as
  his decision was taken his car was pounding on the trail of the joy
  wagon.</p>

  <p>He saw the tower a quarter of an hour before he came to it: a squat,
  ancient building, for all the world like an inordinately high sheep-fold.
  When he came up to them the char-à-banc had been drawn on to the grass, and
  the company was putting the finishing touches to its make-up. Adele he did
  not see at once&mdash;she was changing in a little canvas tent, whilst Jack
  Knebworth and the camera-man wrangled over light and position.</p>

  <p>Michael had too much intelligence to butt in at this moment, and strolled
  up to the tower, examining the curious courses which generation after
  generation had added to the original foundations. He knew very little of
  masonry, but he was able to detect the Roman portion of the wall, and thought
  he saw the place where Saxon builders had filled in a gap.</p>

  <p>One of the hands was fixing a ladder up which Roselle was to pass. The
  story which was being filmed was that of a girl who, starting life in the
  chorus, had become the wife of a nobleman with archaic ideas. The poor but
  honest young man who had loved her in her youth (Michael gathered that a
  disconsolate Reggie Connolly played this part) was ever at hand to help her;
  and now, when shut up in a stone room of the keep, it was he who was to
  rescue her.</p>

  <p>The actual castle tower had been shot in Arundel. Old Griff Tower was to
  serve for a close-up, showing the girl descending from her prison in the arms
  of her lover, by the aid of a rope of knotted sheets.</p>

  <p>"It's going to be deuced awkward getting down," said Reggie lugubriously.
  "Of course, they've got a rope inside the sheet, so there's no chance of it
  breaking. But Miss Leamington is really fearfully, awfully heavy! You try and
  lift her yourself, old thing, and see how you like it!"</p>

  <p>Nothing would have given Michael greater pleasure than to carry out the
  instructions literally.</p>

  <p>"It's too robust a part for me, it is really," bleated Reggie. "I'm not a
  cave-man, I'm not indeed! I've told Knebworth that it isn't the job for me.
  And besides, why do they want a close-up? Why don't they make a dummy that I
  could carry and sling about? And why doesn't she come down by herself?"</p>

  <p>"It's dead easy," said Knebworth, who had walked up and overheard the
  latter part of the conversation. "Miss Leamington will hold the rope and take
  the weight off you. All you've got to do is to look brave and pretty."</p>

  <p>"That's all very well," grumbled Reggie, "but climbing down ropes is not
  the job I was engaged for. We all have our likes and our dislikes, and that's
  one of my dislikes."</p>

  <p>"Try it," said Jack laconically.</p>

  <p>The property-man had fixed the rope to an iron staple which he had driven
  to the inside of the tower, the top of which would not be shown in the
  picture. The actual descent had been acted by "doubles" in Arundel on a long
  shot; it was only the close-up that Jack needed. The first rehearsal nearly
  ended in disaster. With a squeak, Connolly let go his burden, and the girl
  would have fallen but for her firm grip on the rope.</p>

  <p>"Try it again!" stormed Jack. "Remember you're playing a man's part. Young
  Coogan would hold her better than that!"</p>

  <p>They tried again, with greater success, and after the third rehearsal,
  when poor Reggie was in a state of exhaustion: "Camera!" said Knebworth
  shortly, and then began the actual taking of the picture.</p>

  <p>Whatever his other drawbacks were, and whatever his disadvantages, there
  was no doubt that Connolly was an artist. Racked with agony at this unusual
  exertion though he was, he could smile sweetly into the upturned face of the
  girl, whilst the camera, fixed upon a collapsible platform, clicked
  encouragingly as it was lowered to keep pace with the escaping Lovers. They
  touched ground, and with one last languishing look at the girl, Connolly
  posed for the final three seconds.</p>

  <p>"That'll do," said Jack.</p>

  <p>Reggie sat down heavily.</p>

  <p>"My heavens!" he wailed, feeling his arms painfully. "I'll never do that
  again, I won't really. I've had as much of that stuff as ever I'm going to
  have, Mr. Knebworth. It was terrible! I thought I should die!"</p>

  <p>"Well, you didn't." said Jack good-humouredly. "Now have a rest, you boys
  and girls, and then we'll shoot the escape."</p>

  <p>The camera was moved off twenty or thirty yards, and whilst Reggie
  Connolly writhed in agony on the ground, the girl walked over to Michael.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad that's over," she said thankfully. "Poor Mr. Connolly! The awful
  language he was using inside nearly made me laugh, and that would have meant
  that we should have had to take it all over again. But it wasn't easy," she
  added.</p>

  <p>Her own arm was bruised, and the rope had rubbed raw a little place on her
  wrist. Michael had an insane desire to kiss the raw skin, but restrained
  himself.</p>

  <p>"What did you think of me? Did I look anything approaching graceful? I
  felt like a bundle of straw!"</p>

  <p>"You looked&mdash;wonderful." he said fervently, and she shot a quick
  glance at him and dropped her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're prejudiced," she said demurely.</p>

  <p>"I have that feeling too," said Michael. "What is inside?" He pointed.</p>

  <p>"Inside the tower? Nothing, except a lot of rock and wild bush, and a
  pathetic dwarf tree. I loved it."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Just now you said you were glad it was over. I presume you were referring
  to the play and not to the interior of the tower?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, a twinkle in her eye.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Knebworth says he may have to take a night shot if he's not satisfied
  with the day picture. Poor Mr. Connolly! He'll throw up his part."</p>

  <p>At that moment Jack Knebworth's voice was heard.</p>

  <p>"Don't take the ladder, Collins!" he shouted. "Put it down on the grass
  behind the tower. I may have to come up here tonight, so you can leave
  anything that won't be hurt by the weather, and collect it again in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>Adele made a little face.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid he would," she said. "Not that I mind very much &mdash;it's
  rather fun. But Mr. Connolly's nervousness communicates itself in some way. I
  wish you were playing that part."</p>

  <p>"I wish to heaven I were!" said Michael, with such sincerity in his voice
  that she coloured. Jack Knebworth came toward them.</p>

  <p>"Did you leave anything up there, Adele?" he asked, pointing to the
  tower.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Knebworth." she said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Well, what's that?"</p>

  <p>He pointed to something round that showed above the edge of the tower
  top.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's moving!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>As he spoke a head came slowly into view. It was followed by a massive
  pair of hairy shoulders, and then a leg was thrown over the wall.</p>

  <p>It was Bhag!</p>

  <p>His tawny hair was white with dust, his face was powdered grotesquely. All
  these things Michael noticed. Then, as the creature put out his hand to
  steady himself, Michael saw that each wrist was encircled by the half of a
  broken pair of handcuffs!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap29"
     id="chap29">XXIX. BHAG'S RETURN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The girl screamed and gripped Michael's arm.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" she asked. "Is it the Thing that came to my&mdash;my
  room?"</p>

  <p>Michael put her aside gently and ran toward the tower. As he did so, Bhag
  took a leap and dropped on the ground. For a moment he stood, his knuckles on
  the ground, his malignant face turned in the direction of the man. And then
  he sniffed, and, with that queer twittering noise of his, went ambling across
  the downs and disappeared over a near-by crest.</p>

  <p>Michael raced in pursuit. By the time he came into view the great ape was
  a quarter of a mile away, running at top speed, and always keeping close to
  the hedges that divided the fields he had to cross. Pursuit was useless, and
  the detective went slowly back to the alarmed company.</p>

  <p>"It is only an orang-outang belonging to Sir Gregory, and perfectly
  harmless," he said. "He has been missing from the house for two or three
  days."</p>

  <p>"He must have been hiding in the tower," said Knebworth, and Michael
  nodded. "Well, I'm darned glad he didn't choose to come out at the moment I
  was shooting," said the director, mopping his forehead. "You didn't see
  anything of him, Adele?"</p>

  <p>Michael guessed that the girl was pale under her yellow make-up, and the
  hand she raised to her lips shook a little.</p>

  <p>"That explains the mystery of the handcuffs," said Knebworth.</p>

  <p>"Did you notice them?" asked Michael quickly. "Yes, that explains the
  broken link," he said, "but it doesn't exactly explain the butyl
  chloride."</p>

  <p>He held the girl's arm as he spoke, and in the warm strong pressure she
  felt something more than his sympathy.</p>

  <p>"Were you a little frightened?"</p>

  <p>"I was badly frightened," she confessed. "How terrible! Was that
  Bhag?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"That was Bhag," he said. "I suppose he's been hiding in the tower ever
  since his disappearance. You saw nothing when you were on the top of the
  wall?"</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to say I didn't, or I should have dropped. There are a large
  number of bushes where he might have been hidden."</p>

  <p>Michael decided to look for himself. They put up the ladder and he climbed
  to the broad top of the tower and looked down. At the base of the stonework
  the ground sloped away in a manner curiously reminiscent of the shell-holes
  he had seen during the war in France. The actual floor of the tower was not
  visible under the hawthorn bushes which grew thickly at the centre. He caught
  a glimpse of the jagged edges of rock, the distorted branches of an old tree,
  and that was all.</p>

  <p>There was ample opportunity for concealment. Possibly Bhag had hidden
  there most of the time, sleeping off the effects of his labour and his
  wounds; for Michael had seen something that nobody else had noticed
  &mdash;the gashed skin and the ear that had been slashed in half.</p>

  <p>He came down the ladder again and rejoined Knebworth.</p>

  <p>"I think that finishes our work for today," said Jack dubiously. "I smell
  hysteria, and it will be a long time before I can get the girls to come up
  for a night picture."</p>

  <p>Michael drove the director back in his car, and all the way home he was
  considering this strange appearance of the ape. Somebody had handcuffed Bhag:
  he ought to have guessed that when he saw the torn link. No human being could
  have broken those apart. And Bhag had escaped&mdash;from whom? How? And why
  had he not returned to Griff Towers and to his master?</p>

  <p>When he had dropped the director at the studio he went straight on to
  Gregory's house, and found the baronet playing clock-golf on a strip of lawn
  that ran by the side of the house. The man was still heavily bandaged, but he
  was making good recovery.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Bhag is back. He returned half an hour ago. Where he has been,
  heaven knows! I've often wished that chap could talk, but I've never wished
  it so much as I do at this moment. Somebody had put irons on him: I've just
  taken them off."</p>

  <p>"Can I see them?"</p>

  <p>"You knew it, did you?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him. He came out of the old tower on the hill." Michael pointed;
  from where they stood, the tower was in sight.</p>

  <p>"Is that so? And what the devil was he doing there?"</p>

  <p>Sir Gregory scratched his chin thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"He's been away before, but mostly he goes to a shoot of mine about three
  miles away, where there's plenty of cover and no intruders. I discovered that
  when a poacher saw him, and, like a fool, shot at him &mdash;that poacher was
  a lucky man to escape with his life. Have you found the body of Foss?"</p>

  <p>The baronet had resumed his playing, and was looking at the ball at his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"No," said Michael quietly.</p>

  <p>"Expect to find it?"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be surprised."</p>

  <p>Sir Gregory stood, his hands leaning on his club, looking across the
  wold.</p>

  <p>"What's the law in this country, suppose a man accidentally kills a
  servant who tried to knife him?"</p>

  <p>"He would have to stand his trial," said Michael, "and a verdict of
  'justifiable homicide' would be returned and he would be set free."</p>

  <p>"But suppose he didn't reveal it? Suppose he&mdash;well, did away with the
  body&mdash;buried it&mdash;and let the matter slide?"</p>

  <p>"Then he would place himself in a remarkably dangerous position," said
  Michael. "Particularly"&mdash;he watched the man closely&mdash;"if a woman,
  who is no longer a woman friend, happened to be a witness or had knowledge of
  the act."</p>

  <p>Gregory Penne's one visible eye blinked quickly, and he went that curious
  purple colour which Michael had seen before when he was agitated.</p>

  <p>"Suppose she tried to get money out of him by threatening to tell the
  police?"</p>

  <p>"Then," said the patient Michael, "she would go to prison for blackmail,
  and possibly as an accessory to or after the fact."</p>

  <p>"Would she?" Sir Gregory's voice was eager. "She would be an accessory if
  she saw&mdash;him cut the man down? Mind you, this happened years ago.
  There's a Statute of Limitations, isn't there?"</p>

  <p>"Not for murder," said Michael.</p>

  <p>"Murder! Would you call that murder?" asked the other in alarm. "In
  self-defence? Rot!"</p>

  <p>Things were gradually being made light to Michael. Once Stella Mendoza had
  called the man a murderer, and Michael's nimble mind, which could reconstruct
  the scene with almost unerring precision, began to grow active. A servant, a
  coloured man, probably one of his Malayan slaves, had run amok, and Penne had
  killed him&mdash;possibly in self-defence &mdash;and then had grown
  frightened of the consequences. He remembered Stella's
  description&mdash;"Penne is a bluffer and a coward at heart." That was the
  story in a nutshell.</p>

  <p>"Where did you bury your unfortunate victim?" he asked coolly, and the man
  started.</p>

  <p>"Bury? What do you mean?" he blustered. "I didn't murder or bury anybody.
  I was merely putting a hypothetical case to you."</p>

  <p>"It sounded more real than hypothesis," said Michael, "but I won't press
  the question."</p>

  <p>In truth, crimes of this question bored Michael Brixan; and, but for the
  unusual and curious circumstances of the Head-Hunter's villainies, he would
  have dropped the case almost as soon as he came on to it.</p>

  <p>There was yet another attraction, which he did not name, even to himself.
  As for Sir Gregory Penne, the grossness of the man and his hobbies, the
  sordid vulgarity of his amours, were more than a little sickening. He would
  gladly have cut Sir Gregory out of his life, only &mdash;he was not yet
  sure.</p>

  <p>"It is very curious how these questions crop up," Penne was saying, as he
  came out of his reverie. "A chap like myself, who doesn't have much to occupy
  his mind, gets on an abstract problem of that kind and never leaves it. So
  she'd be an accessory after the fact, would she? That would mean penal
  servitude."</p>

  <p>He seemed to derive a great deal of satisfaction from this thought, and
  was almost amiable by the time Michael parted from him, after an examination
  of the broken handcuffs. They were British and of an old pattern.</p>

  <p>"Is Bhag hurt very much?" asked Michael as he put them down,</p>

  <p>"Not very much; he's got a cut or two," said the other calmly. He made no
  attempt to disguise the happenings of that night. "He came to my assistance,
  poor brute! This fellow nearly got him. In fact, poor old Bhag was knocked
  out, but went after them like a brick."</p>

  <p>"What hat was that man wearing&mdash;the brown man?"</p>

  <p>"Keji? I don't know. I suppose he wore a hat, but I didn't notice it.
  Why?"</p>

  <p>"I was merely asking," said Michael carelessly. "Perhaps he lost it in the
  caves."</p>

  <p>He watched the other narrowly as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Caves? I've never heard about those. What are they? Are there any caves
  near by?" asked Sir Gregory innocently. "You've a wonderful grip of the
  topography of the county, Brixan. I've been living here off and on for twenty
  years and I lose myself every time I go into Chichester!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap30"
     id="chap30">XXX. THE ADVERTISEMENT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE question of the caves intrigued Michael more than any
  feature the case had presented. He bethought himself Mr. Longvale, whose
  knowledge of the country was encyclopaedic. That gentleman was out, but
  Michael met him driving his antique car from Chichester. To say that he saw
  him is to mistake facts. The sound of that old car was audible long before it
  came into sight around a bend of the road. Michael drew up, Longvale
  following his example, and parked his car behind that ancient bus.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is rather noisy," admitted the old man, rubbing his bald head
  with a brilliant bandana handkerchief. "I'm only beginning to realize the
  fact of late years. Personally, I do not think that a noiseless car could
  give me as much satisfaction. One feels that something is happening."</p>

  <p>"You ought to buy a&mdash;" said Michael with a smile, as he mentioned the
  name of a famous car.</p>

  <p>"I thought of doing so," said the other seriously, "but I love old
  things&mdash;that is my eccentricity."</p>

  <p>Michael questioned him about the caves, and, to his surprise, the old man
  immediately returned with an affirmative.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've heard of them frequently. When I was a boy my father told me
  that the country round was honeycombed with caves, and that, if anybody was
  lucky enough to find them, they would discover great stores of brandy. Nobody
  has found them, as far as I know. There used to be an entrance over
  there"&mdash;he pointed in the direction of Griff Tower&mdash;"but many years
  ago&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He retold the familiar story of the landslide and of the passing out of
  two companies of gallant knights and squires, which probably the old man had
  got from the same source of information as Michael had drawn upon.</p>

  <p>"The popular legend was that a subterranean river ran into the sea near
  Selsey Bill&mdash;of course, some distance beneath the surface of the water.
  But, as you know, country people live on such legends. In all probability it
  is nothing but a legend."</p>

  <p>Inspector Lyle was waiting for the detective when he arrived, with news of
  a startling character.</p>

  <p>"The advertisement appeared in this morning's Daily Star," he said.</p>

  <p>Michael took the slip of paper. It was identically worded with its
  predecessor.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">Is your trouble of mind or body incurable? Do you
  hesitate on the brink of the abyss? Does courage fail you? Write to
  Benefactor, Box&mdash;</p>

  <p>"There will be no reply till tomorrow morning. Letters are to be
  re-addressed to a shop in the Lambeth Road, and the chief wants you to be
  ready to pick up the trail."</p>

  <p>The trail indeed proved to be well laid. At four o'clock on the following
  afternoon a lame old woman limped into the newsagent's shop on the Lambeth
  Road and inquired for a letter addressed to Mr. Vole. There were three
  waiting for her. She paid the fee, put the letters into a rusty old handbag,
  and limped out of the shop, mumbling and talking to herself. Passing down the
  Lambeth Road, she boarded a tram-car en route for Clapham, and near the
  Common she alighted and, passing out of the region of middle-class houses,
  came to a jumble of tenements and ancient tumble-down dwellings.</p>

  <p>Every corner she turned brought her to a street meaner than the last, and
  finally to a low, arched alley way, the paving of which had not been renewed
  for years. It was a little cul-de-sac, its houses, built in the same pattern,
  joined wall to wall, and before the last of these site stopped, took out a
  key from her pocket, and opened the door. She was turning to close it when
  she was aware that a man stood in the entrance, a tall, good-looking
  gentleman, who must have been on her heels all the time.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, Mother," he said.</p>

  <p>The old woman peered at him suspiciously, grumbling under her breath. Only
  hospital doctors and workhouse folk, people connected with charity, called
  women "mother"; and sometimes the police got the habit. Her grimy old face
  wrinkled hideously at this last unpleasant thought.</p>

  <p>"I want to have a little talk with you."</p>

  <p>"Come in," she said shrilly.</p>

  <p>The boarding of the passage-way was broken in half a dozen places and was
  indescribably dirty, but it represented the spirit of pure hygiene compared
  with the stuffy horror which was her sitting-room and kitchen.</p>

  <p>"What are you, horspital or p'lice?"</p>

  <p>"Police," said Michael. "I want three letters you've collected."</p>

  <p>To his surprise the woman showed relief.</p>

  <p>"Oh, is that all?" she said. "Well, that's a job I do for a gentleman.
  I've done it for years. I've never had any complaint before."</p>

  <p>"What is his name?"</p>

  <p>"Don't know his name. Just whatever name happens to be on the letters. I
  send 'em on to him."</p>

  <p>From under a heap of rubbish she produced three envelopes, addressed in
  typewritten characters. The typewriting Michael recognized. They were
  addressed to a street in Guildford.</p>

  <p>Michael took the letters from her handbag. Two of them he read; the third
  was a dummy which he himself had written. The most direct cross-examination,
  however, revealed nothing. The woman did the work, receiving a pound for her
  trouble in a letter from the unknown, who told her where the letters were to
  be collected.</p>

  <p>"She was a little mad and indescribably beastly," said Michael in disgust
  when he reported, "and the Guildford inquiries don't help us forward. There's
  another agent there, who sends the letters back to London, which they never
  reach. That is the mystery of the proceeding. There simply isn't such an
  address at London, and I can only suggest that they are intercepted en route.
  The Guildford police have that matter in hand."</p>

  <p>Staines was very worried.</p>

  <p>"Michael, I oughtn't to have put you on this job," he said. "My first
  thoughts were best. Scotland Yard is kicking, and say that the meddling of
  outsiders is responsible for the Head-Hunter not being brought to justice.
  You know something of inter-departmental jealousy, and you don't need me to
  tell you that I'm getting more kicks than I'm entitled to."</p>

  <p>Michael looked down at his chief reflectively.</p>

  <p>"I can get the Head-Hunter; but more than ever I'm convinced that we
  cannot convict him until we know a little more about&mdash;the caves!"</p>

  <p>Staines frowned.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite get you, Mike. Which caves are these?"</p>

  <p>"There are some caves in the neighbourhood of Chichester. Foss knew about
  them and suspected their association with the Head-Hunter. Give me four days,
  Major, and I'll have them both. And if I fail,"&mdash;he paused&mdash;"if I
  fail, the next time you say good morning to me I shall be looking up to you
  from the interior of one of the Head-Hunter's boxes!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap31"
     id="chap31">XXXI. JOHN PERCIVAL LIGGITT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was the second day of Michael's visit to town, and, for a
  reason which she could not analyse, Adele felt "out" with the world. And yet
  the work was going splendidly, and Jack Knebworth, usually sparing of his
  praise, had almost rhapsodized over a little scene which she had acted with
  Connolly. So generous was he in his praise, and so comprehensive, that even
  Reggie came in for his share and was willing and ready to revise his earlier
  estimate of the leading lady's ability.</p>

  <p>"To be perfectly frank and honest, Mr. Knebworth," he said, in this moment
  of candour, "Leamington is good. Of course, I'm always on the spot to give
  her tips, and there's nothing quite so educative&mdash;if I may use the
  term&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You may," said Jack Knebworth.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Connolly, "&mdash;as having a finished artiste playing
  opposite to you. It doesn't do me much good, but it helps her a lot; it
  inspires courage and all that sort of thing. And though I've had a perfectly
  awful, dreadful time, I feel that she pays for the coaching."</p>

  <p>"Oh, do you?" growled the old man. "And I'd like to say the same about
  you, Reggie! But unfortunately, all the coaching you've had or ever will get
  is not going to improve you."</p>

  <p>Reggie's superior smile would have irritated one less equable than the
  director.</p>

  <p>"You're perfectly right, Mr. Knebworth," he said earnestly. "I can't
  improve! I've touched the zenith of my power, and I doubt whether you'll ever
  look upon the like of me again. I'm certainly the best juvenile lead in this,
  and possibly in any, country. I had three offers to go to Hollywood, and
  you'll never believe who is the lady who asked me to play against
  her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe any of it," said Jack even-temperedly, "but you're right
  to an extent about Miss Leamington. She's fine. And I agree that it doesn't
  do you much good playing against her, because she makes you look like a large
  glass of heavily diluted beer."</p>

  <p>Later in the day Adele herself asked her grey-haired chief whether it was
  true that Reggie would soon be leaving England for another and a more
  ambitious sphere.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think so," said Jack. "There never was an actor that hadn't a
  better contract up his sleeve and was ready to take it. But when it comes to
  a show down, you find that the contracts they're willing to tear up in order
  to take something better are locked away in a lawyer's office and can't be
  got out. In the picture business all over the world there are actors and
  actresses who are leaving by the first boat to show Hollywood how it's done.
  I guess these liners would sail empty if they waited for 'em! That's all
  bluff&mdash;part of the artificial life of make-believe in which actors and
  actresses have their being."</p>

  <p>"Has Mr. Brixan come back?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I've not heard from him. There was a tough-looking fellow called at
  the studio half an hour ago to ask whether he'd returned."</p>

  <p>"Rather an unpleasant-looking tramp?" she asked. "I spoke to him. He said
  he had a letter for Mr. Brixan which he would not deliver to anybody
  else."</p>

  <p>She looked through the window which commanded a view of the entrance drive
  to the studio. Standing outside on the edge of the pavement was the wreck of
  a man. Long, lank black hair, streaked with grey, fell from beneath the
  soiled and dilapidated golf cap; he was apparently shirtless, for the collar
  of his indescribable jacket was buttoned up to his throat; and his bare toes
  showed through one gaping boot.</p>

  <p>He might have been a man of sixty, but it was difficult to arrive at his
  age. It looked as though the grey, stubbled beard had not met a razor since
  he was in prison last. His eyes were red and inflamed, his nose that crimson
  which is almost blue. His hands were thrust into the pockets of his trousers,
  and seemed to be their only visible means of support, until you saw the
  string that was tied round his lean waist; and as he stood, he shuffled his
  feet rhythmically, whistling a doleful tune. From time to time he took one of
  his hands from his pockets and examined the somewhat soiled envelope it held,
  and then, as if satisfied with the scrutiny, put it back again and continued
  his jigging vigil.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you ought to see that letter?" asked the girl, troubled. "It
  may be very important."</p>

  <p>"I thought that too," said Jack Knebworth, "but when I asked him to let me
  see the note, he just grinned."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who it's from?"</p>

  <p>"No more than a crow, my dear," said Knebworth patiently. "And now let's
  get off the all-absorbing subject of Michael Brixan, and get back to the fair
  Roselle. That shot I took of the tower can't be bettered, so I'm going to cut
  out the night picture, and from now on we'll work on the lot."</p>

  <p>The production was a heavy one, unusually so for one of Knebworth's; the
  settings more elaborate, the crowd bigger than ever he had handled since he
  came to England. It was not an easy day for the girl, and she was utterly
  fagged when she started homeward that night.</p>

  <p>"Ain't seen Mr. Brixan, miss?" said a high-pitched voice as she reached
  the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>She turned with a start. She had forgotten the existence of the tramp.</p>

  <p>"No, he hasn't been," she said. "You had better see Mr. Knebworth again.
  Mr. Brixan lives with him."</p>

  <p>"Don't I know it? Ain't I got all the information possible about him? I
  should say I had!"</p>

  <p>"He is in London&mdash;I suppose you know that?"</p>

  <p>"He ain't in London," said the other disappointedly. "If he was in London,
  I shouldn't be hanging around here, should I? No, he left London yesterday,
  I'm going to wait till I see him."</p>

  <p>She was amused by his pertinacity, though it was difficult for her to be
  amused at anything in the state of utter weariness into which she had
  fallen.</p>

  <p>Crossing the market square, she had to jump quickly to avoid being knocked
  down by a car which she knew was Stella Mendoza's. Stella could be at times a
  little reckless, and the motto upon the golden mascot on her
  radiator&mdash;"Jump or Die"&mdash;held a touch of sincerity.</p>

  <p>She was in a desperate hurry now, and cursed fluently as she swung her car
  to avoid the girl, whom she recognized. Sir Gregory had come to his senses,
  and she wanted to get at him before he lost them again. She pulled up the car
  with a jerk at the gates of Griff Towers, flung open the door, and jumped
  out.</p>

  <p>"If I don't return in two hours, you can go into Chichester and fetch the
  police," she said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap32"
     id="chap32">XXXII. GREGORY'S WAY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">STELLA had left a note to the same effect on her table. If
  she did not return by a certain hour, the police were to read the letter they
  would find on her mantelpiece. She had not allowed for the fact that neither
  note nor letter would be seen until the next morning.</p>

  <p>To Stella Mendoza, the interview was one of the most important and vital
  in her life. She had purposely delayed her departure in the hope that Gregory
  Penne would take a more generous view of his obligations, though she had very
  little hope that he would change his mind on the all-important matter of
  money. And now, by some miracle, he had relented; had spoken to her in an
  almost friendly tone on the 'phone; had laughed at her reservations and the
  precautions which she had promised she would take; and in the end she had
  overcome her natural fears.</p>

  <p>He received her, not in his library, but in the big apartment immediately
  above. It was longer, for it embraced the space occupied on the lower floor
  by the small drawing-room; but in the matter of furnishing it differed
  materially. Stella had only once been in "The Splendid Hall", as he called
  it. Its vastness and darkness had frightened her, and the display which he
  had organized for her benefit was one of her unpleasant memories.</p>

  <p>The big room was covered with a thick black carpet, and the floor-space
  was unrelieved by any sign of furniture. Divans were set about, the walls
  covered with Eastern hangings; there was a row of scarlet pillars up both
  sides of the room, and such light as there was came from three heavily shaded
  black lanterns which cast pools of yellow light upon the carpet but did not
  contribute to the gaiety of the room.</p>

  <p>Penne was sitting cross-legged on a silken divan, his eyes watching the
  gyrations of a native girl as she twirled and twisted to the queer sound of
  native guitars played by three solemn-faced men in the darkened corner of the
  room. Gregory wore a suit of flaming red-coloured pyjamas, and his glassy
  stare and brute mouth told Stella all that she wanted to know about her evil
  friend.</p>

  <p>Sir Gregory Penne was no less and no more than a slave to his appetites.
  Born a rich man, he had never known denial of his desires. Money had grown to
  money in a sort of cellular progression, and when the normal pleasures of
  life grew stale, and he was satiated by the sweets of his possessions, he
  found his chiefest satisfaction in taking that which was forbidden. The raids
  which his agents had made from time to time in the jungles of his second home
  gave him trophies, human and material, that lost their value when they were
  under his hand.</p>

  <p>Stella, who had visions of becoming mistress of Griff Towers, became less
  attractive as she grew more complaisant. And at last her attraction had
  vanished, and she was no more to him than the table at which he sat.</p>

  <p>A doctor had told him that drink would kill him&mdash;he drank the more.
  Liquor brought him splendid visions, precious stories that wove themselves
  into dazzling fabrics of dreams. It pleased him to place, in the forefront of
  his fuddled mind, a slip of a girl who hated him. A gross bully, an equally
  gross coward, he could not, or would not, argue a theme to its logical and
  unpleasant conclusion. At the end there was always his money that could be
  paid in smaller or larger quantities to settle all grievances against
  him.</p>

  <p>The native who had conducted Stella Mendoza to the apartment had
  disappeared, and she waited at the end of the divan, looking at the man for a
  long time before he took any notice of her. Presently he turned his head and
  favoured her with a stupid, vacant stare.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Stella," he said thickly&mdash;"sit down. You couldn't dance
  like that, eh? None of you Europeans have got the grace, the suppleness. Look
  at her!"</p>

  <p>The dancing-girl was twirling at a furious rate, her scanty draperies
  enveloping her like a cloud.</p>

  <p>Presently, with a crash of the guitars, she sank, face downward, on the
  carpet. Gregory said something in Malayan, and the woman showed her white
  teeth in a smile. Stella had seen her before: there used to be two
  dancing-girls, but one had contracted scarlet fever and had been hurriedly
  deported. Gregory had a horror of disease.</p>

  <p>"Sit down here," he commanded, laying his hand on the divan.</p>

  <p>As if by magic, every servant in the room had disappeared, and she
  suddenly felt cold.</p>

  <p>"I've left my chauffeur outside, with instructions to go for the police if
  I'm not out in half an hour," she said loudly, and he laughed.</p>

  <p>"You ought to have brought your nurse, Stella. What's the matter with you
  nowadays? Can't you talk anything but police? I want to talk to you," he said
  in a milder tone.</p>

  <p>"And I want to talk to you, Gregory. I am leaving Chichester for good, and
  I don't want to see the place again."</p>

  <p>"That means you don't want to see me again, eh? Well. I'm pretty well
  through with you, and there's going to be no weeping and wailing and gnashing
  of teeth on my part."</p>

  <p>"My new company&mdash;" she began, and he stopped her with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"If your new company depends upon my putting up the money, you can forget
  it," he said roughly. "I've seen my lawyer&mdash;at least, I've seen somebody
  who knows&mdash;and he tells me that if you're trying to blackmail me about
  Tjarji, you're liable to get into trouble yourself. I'll put up money for
  you," he went on. "Not a lot but enough. I don't suppose you're a beggar, for
  I've given you sufficient already to start three companies. Stella, I'm crazy
  about that girl."</p>

  <p>She looked at him, her mouth open in surprise.</p>

  <p>"What girl?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Adele. Isn't that her name?&mdash;Adele Leamington."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean the extra girl that took my place?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>He nodded, his sleepy eyes fixed on hers.</p>

  <p>"That's it. She's my type&mdash;more than you ever were, Stella. And that
  isn't meant in any way disparaging to you."</p>

  <p>She was content to listen: his declaration had taken her breath away.</p>

  <p>"I'll go a long way to get her," he went on. "I'd marry her, if that meant
  anything to her&mdash;it's about time I married, anyway. Now you're a friend
  of hers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A friend!" scoffed Stella, finding her voice. "How could I be a friend of
  hers when she has taken my place? And what if I were? You don't suppose I
  should bring a girl to this hell upon earth?"</p>

  <p>He brought his eyes round to hers&mdash;cold, malignant, menacing.</p>

  <p>"This hell upon earth has been heaven for you. It has given you wings,
  anyway! Don't go back to London, Stella, not for a week or two. Get to know
  this girl. You've got opportunities that nobody else has. Kid her
  along&mdash;you're not going to lose anything by it. Speak about me; tell her
  what a good fellow I am; and tell her what a chance she has. You needn't
  mention marriage, but you can if it helps any. Show her some of your
  jewels&mdash;that big pendant I gave you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He rambled on, and she listened, her bewilderment giving place to an
  uncontrollable fury.</p>

  <p>"You brute!" she said at last. "To dare suggest that I should bring this
  girl to Griff! I don't like her&mdash;naturally. But I'd go down on my knees
  to her to beg her not to come. You think I'm jealous?" Her lips curled at the
  sight of the smile on his face. "That's where you're wrong, Gregory. I'm
  jealous of the position she's taken at the studio, but, so far as you're
  concerned"&mdash;she shrugged her shoulders&mdash;"you mean nothing to me. I
  doubt very much if you've ever meant more than a steady source of income.
  That's candid, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>She got up from the divan and began putting on her gloves.</p>

  <p>"As you don't seem to want to help me," she said, "I'll have to find a way
  of making you keep your promise. And you did promise me a company, Gregory; I
  suppose you've forgotten that?"</p>

  <p>"I was more interested in you then," he said. "Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going back to my cottage, and tomorrow I'm returning to town," she
  said.</p>

  <p>He looked first at one end of the room and then at the other, and then at
  her.</p>

  <p>"You're not going back to your cottage; you're staying here, my dear," he
  said.</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"You told your chauffeur to go for the police, did you? I'll tell you
  something! Your chauffeur is in my kitchen at this moment, having his supper.
  If you think that he's likely to leave before you, you don't know me,
  Stella!"</p>

  <p>He gathered up the dressing-gown that was spread on the divan and slipped
  his arms into the hanging sleeves. A terrible figure he was in the girl's
  eyes&mdash;something unclean, obscene. The scarlet pyjama jacket gave his
  face a demoniacal value, and she felt herself cringing from him.</p>

  <p>He was quick to notice the action, and his eyes glowed with the light of
  triumph.</p>

  <p>"Bhag is downstairs," he said significantly. "He handles people rough. He
  handled one girl so that I had to call in a doctor. You'll come with me
  without&mdash;assistance?"</p>

  <p>She nodded dumbly; her knees gave way under her as she walked. She had
  bearded the beast in his den once too often.</p>

  <p>Half-way along the corridor he unlocked a door of a room and pushed it
  open.</p>

  <p>"Go in there and stay there," he said. "I'll talk to you tomorrow, when
  I'm sober. I'm drunk now. Maybe I'll send you someone to keep you
  company&mdash;I don't know yet." He ruffled his scanty hair in drunken
  perplexity. "But I've got to be sober before I deal with you."</p>

  <p>The door slammed on her and a key turned. She was in complete darkness, in
  a room she did not know. For one wild, terrified moment she wondered if she
  was alone.</p>

  <p>It was a long time before her palm touched the little button projecting
  from the wall. She pressed it. A lamp enclosed in a crystal globe set in the
  ceiling flashed into sparkling light. She was in what had evidently been a
  small bedroom. The bedstead had been removed, but a mattress and a pillow
  were folded up in one corner. There was a window, heavily barred, but no
  other exit. She examined the door: the handle turned in her grasp; there was
  not even a keyhole in which she could try her own key.</p>

  <p>Going to the window, she pulled up the sash, for the room was stuffy and
  airless. She found herself looking out from the back of the house, across the
  lawn to a belt of trees which she could just discern. The road ran parallel
  with the front of the house, and the shrillest scream would not be heard by
  anybody on the road.</p>

  <p>Sitting down in one of the chairs, she considered her position. Having
  overcome her fear, she had that in her possession which would overcome
  Gregory if it came to a fight. Pulling up her skirt, she unbuckled the soft
  leather belt about her waist, and from the Russian-leather holster it
  supported she took a diminutive Browning&mdash;a toy of a weapon but wholly
  businesslike in action. Sliding back the jacket, she threw a cartridge into
  the chamber and pulled up the safety-catch; then she examined the magazine
  and pressed it back again.</p>

  <p>"Now, Gregory," she said aloud, and at that moment her face went round to
  the window, and she started up with a scream.</p>

  <p>Two grimy hands gripped the bars; glaring in at her was the horrible face
  of a tramp. Her trembling hand shot out for the pistol, but before it could
  close on the butt, the face had disappeared; and though she went round to the
  window and looked out, the bars prevented her from getting a clear view of
  the parapet along which the uncouth figure was creeping.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap33"
     id="chap33">XXXIII. THE TRAP THAT FAILED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Ten o'clock was striking from Chichester Cathedral when the
  tramp, who half an hour ago had been peering and prying into the secrets of
  Griff Towers, made his appearance in the market-place. His clothes were even
  more dusty and soiled, and a policeman who saw him stood squarely in his
  path.</p>

  <p>"On the road?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," whined the man.</p>

  <p>"You can get out of Chichester as quick as you like," said the officer.
  "Are you looking for a bed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you try the casual ward at the work house?"</p>

  <p>"They're full up, sir."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie," said the officer. "Now understand, if I see you again I'll
  arrest you!"</p>

  <p>Muttering something to himself, the squalid figure moved on toward the
  Arundel Road, his shoulders hunched, his hands hidden in the depths of his
  pockets.</p>

  <p>Out of sight of the policeman, he turned abruptly to the right and
  accelerated his pace. He was making for Jack Knebworth's house. The director
  heard the knock, opened the door, and stood aghast at the unexpected
  character of the caller.</p>

  <p>"What do you want, bo'?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brixan come back?"</p>

  <p>"No, he hasn't come back. You'd better give me that letter. I'll get in
  touch with him by 'phone."</p>

  <p>The tramp grinned and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, you don't. I want to see Brixan."</p>

  <p>"Well, you won't see him here tonight," said Jack. And then, suspiciously:
  "My idea is that you don't want to see him at all, and that you're hanging
  around for some other purpose."</p>

  <p>The tramp did not reply. He was whistling softly a distorted passage from
  the "Indian Love Lyrics", and all the time his right foot was beating the
  time.</p>

  <p>"He's in a bad way, is old Brixan," he said, and there was a certain
  amount of pleasure in his voice that annoyed Knebworth.</p>

  <p>"What do you know about him?"</p>

  <p>"I know he's in bad with headquarters&mdash;that's what I know," said the
  tramp. "He couldn't find where the letters went to: that's the trouble with
  him. But I know."</p>

  <p>"Is that what you want to see him about?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded vigorously.</p>

  <p>"I know," he said again. "I could tell him something if he was here, but
  he ain't here."</p>

  <p>"If you know he isn't here," asked the exasperated Jack, "why in blazes do
  you come?"</p>

  <p>"Because the police are chivvying me, that's why. A copper down on the
  market-place is going to pinch me the next time he sees me. So I thought I'd
  come up to fill in the time, that's what!"</p>

  <p>Jack stared at him.</p>

  <p>"You've got a nerve!" he said in awe-stricken tones. "And now you've
  filled in your time and I've entertained you, you can get! Do you want
  anything to eat?"</p>

  <p>"Not me," said the tramp. "I live on the fat of the land, I do!"</p>

  <p>His shrill Cockney voice was getting on Jack's nerves.</p>

  <p>"Well, good night," he said shortly, and closed the door on his
  unprepossessing visitor.</p>

  <p>The tramp waited for quite a long time before he made any move. Then from
  the interior of his cap he took a cigarette and lit it before he shuffled
  back the way he had come, making a long detour to avoid the centre of the
  town where the unfriendly policeman was on duty. A church clock was striking
  a quarter past ten when he reached the corner of the Arundel Road, and,
  throwing away his cigarette, moved into the shadow of the fence and
  waited.</p>

  <p>Five minutes, ten minutes passed, and his keen eyes caught sight of a man
  walking rapidly the way he had come, and he grinned in the darkness. It was
  Knebworth. Jack had been perturbed by the visitor, and was on his way to the
  police-station to make inquiries about Michael. This the tramp guessed,
  though he had little time to consider the director's movements, for a car
  came noiselessly around the corner and stopped immediately opposite him.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, my friend?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the tramp in a sulky voice.</p>

  <p>"Come inside."</p>

  <p>The tramp lurched forward, peering into the dark interior of the car.
  Then, with a turn of his wrist, he jerked open the door, put one foot on the
  running-board, and suddenly flung himself upon the driver.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Head-Hunter, I want you!" he hissed.</p>

  <p>The words were hardly out of his mouth before something soft and wet
  struck him in the face&mdash;something that blinded and choked him, so that
  he let go his grip and fought and clawed like a dying man at the air. A push
  of the driver's foot, and he was flung, breathless, to the sidewalk, and the
  car sped on.</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth had witnessed the scene as far as it could be witnessed in
  the half-darkness, and came running across. A policeman appeared from
  nowhere, and together they lifted the tramp into a sitting position.</p>

  <p>"I've seen this fellow before tonight," said the policeman. "I warned
  him."</p>

  <p>And then the prostrate man drew a long, sighing breath, and his hands went
  up to his eyes.</p>

  <p>"This is where I hand in my resignation," he said, and Knebworth's jaw
  dropped.</p>

  <p>It was the voice of Michael Brixan!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap34"
     id="chap34">XXXIV. THE SEARCH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"YES, it's me," said Michael bitterly. "All right, officer,
  you needn't wait. Jack, I'll come up to the house and get this make-up
  off."</p>

  <p>"For the Lord's sake!" breathed Knebworth, staring at the detective. "I've
  never seen a man made up so well that he deceived me."</p>

  <p>"I've deceived everybody, including myself," said Michael savagely. "I
  thought I'd caught him with a dummy letter, instead of which the devil caught
  me."</p>

  <p>"What was it?"</p>

  <p>"Ammonia, I think&mdash;a concentrated solution thereof." said
  Michael.</p>

  <p>It was twenty minutes before he emerged from the bathroom, his eyes
  inflamed but otherwise his old self.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to trap him in my own way, but he was too smart for me."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who he is?"</p>

  <p>Michael nodded.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I know," he said. "I've got a special force of men here, waiting
  to effect the arrest, but I didn't want a fuss, and I certainly did not want
  blood shed. And bloodshed there will be, unless I am mistaken."</p>

  <p>"I didn't seem to recognize the car, and I know most of the machines in
  this city," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"It is a new one, used only for these midnight adventures of the
  Head-Hunter. He probably garages it away from his house. You asked me if I'd
  have something to eat just now, and I lied and told you I was living on the
  fat of the land. Give me some food, for the love of heaven!"</p>

  <p>Jack went into the larder and brought out some cold meat, brewed a pot of
  coffee, and sat in silence, watching the famished detective dispose of the
  viands.</p>

  <p>"I feel a man now," said Michael as he finished, "for I'd had nothing to
  eat except a biscuit since eleven this morning. By the way, our friend Stella
  Mendoza is staying at Griff Towers, and I'm afraid I rather scared her. I
  happened to be nosing round there an hour ago, to make absolutely sure of my
  bird, and I looked in upon her&mdash;to her alarm!"</p>

  <p>There came a sharp rap at the door, and Jack Knebworth looked up.</p>

  <p>"Who's that at this time of night?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Probably the policeman." said Michael.</p>

  <p>Knebworth opened the door and found a short, stout, middle-aged woman
  standing on the door step with a roll of paper in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Is this Mr. Knebworth's?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"I've brought the play that Miss Leamington left behind. She asked me to
  bring it to you."</p>

  <p>Knebworth took the roll of paper and slipped off the elastic band which
  encircled it. It was the manuscript of "Roselle".</p>

  <p>"Why have you brought this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"She told me to bring it up if I found it."</p>

  <p>"Very good," said Jack, mystified. "Thank you very much."</p>

  <p>He closed the door on the woman and went back to the dining-room.</p>

  <p>"Adele has sent up her script. What's wrong, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>"Who brought it?" asked Michael, interested.</p>

  <p>"Her landlady, I suppose," said Jack, describing the woman.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's she. Adele is not turning in her part?"</p>

  <p>Jack shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't be likely."</p>

  <p>Michael was puzzled.</p>

  <p>"What the dickens does it mean? What did the woman say?"</p>

  <p>"She said that Miss Leamington wanted her to bring up the manuscript if
  she found it."</p>

  <p>Michael was out of the house in a second, and, racing down the street,
  overtook the woman.</p>

  <p>"Will you come back, please?" he said, and escorted her to the house
  again. "Just tell Mr. Knebworth why Miss Leamington sent this manuscript, and
  what you mean by having 'forgotten' it."</p>

  <p>"Why, when she came up to you&mdash;" began the woman.</p>

  <p>"Came up to me?" cried Knebworth quickly.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman from the studio called for her, and said you wanted to see
  her," said the landlady. "Miss Leamington was just going to bed, but I took
  up the message. He said you wanted to see her about the play and asked her to
  bring the manuscript. She had mislaid it somewhere and was in a great state
  about it, so I told her to go on, as you were in a hurry, and I'd bring it
  up. At least, she asked me to do that."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a gentleman was it who called?"</p>

  <p>"A rather stout gentleman. He wasn't exactly a gentleman, he was a
  chauffeur. As a matter of fact, I thought he'd been drinking, though I didn't
  want to alarm Miss Leamington by telling her so."</p>

  <p>"And then what happened?" asked Michael quickly.</p>

  <p>"She came down and got into the car. The chauffeur was already in."</p>

  <p>"A closed car, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>The woman nodded.</p>

  <p>"And then they drove off? What time was this?"</p>

  <p>"Just after half past ten. I remember, because I heard the church clock
  strike just before the car drove up."</p>

  <p>Michael was cool now. His voice scarcely rose above a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-five past eleven," he said, looking at his watch. "You've been a
  long time coming."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't find the paper, sir. It was under Miss Leamington's pillow.
  Isn't she here?"</p>

  <p>"No, she's not here," said Michael quietly. "Thank you very much; I won't
  keep you. Will you wait for me at the police-station?"</p>

  <p>He went upstairs and put on his coat.</p>

  <p>"Where do you think she is?" asked Jack.</p>

  <p>"She is at Griff Towers," replied the other, "and whether Gregory Penne
  lives or dies this night depends entirely upon the treatment that Adele has
  received at his hands."</p>

  <p>At the police-station he found the landlady, a little frightened, more
  than a little tearful.</p>

  <p>"What was Miss Leamington wearing when she went out?"</p>

  <p>"Her blue cloak, sir," whimpered the woman&mdash;"that pretty blue cloak
  she always wore."</p>

  <p>Scotland Yard men were at the station, and it was a heavily loaded car
  that ran out to Chichester&mdash;too heavy for Michael in a fever of
  impatience, for the weight of its human cargo checked its speed, and every
  second was precious. At last, after an eternity of time, the big car swung
  into the drive. Michael did not stop to waken the lodge-keeper, but smashed
  the frail gates open with the buffers of his machine, mounted the slope,
  crossed the gravel parade, and halted.</p>

  <p>There was no need to ring the bell: the door was wide open, and, at the
  head of his party, Mike Brixan dashed through the deserted hall, along the
  corridor into Gregory's library. One light burnt, offering a feeble
  illumination, but the room was empty. With rapid strides he crossed to the
  desk and turned the switch. Bhag's den opened; but Bhag too was an
  absentee.</p>

  <p>He pressed the bell by the side of the fireplace, and almost immediately
  the brown-faced servitor whom he had seen before came, trembling, into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Where is your master?" asked Michael in Dutch.</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he replied, but instinctively he looked up to the
  ceiling.</p>

  <p>"Show me the way."</p>

  <p>They went back to the hall, up the broad stairway on to the first floor.
  Along a corridor, hung with swords, as was its fellow below, he reached
  another open door&mdash;the great dance hall where Gregory Penne had held
  revel that evening. There was nobody in sight, and Michael came out into the
  hall. As he did so, he was aware of a frantic tapping at one of the doors in
  the corridor. The key was in the lock: he turned it and flung the door wide
  open; and Stella Mendoza, white as death, staggered out.</p>

  <p>"Where is Adele?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"I want to ask you that," said Michael sternly. "Where is she?"</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head helplessly, strove to speak, and then collapsed in
  a swoon.</p>

  <p>He did not wait for her to recover, but continued his search. From room to
  room he went, but there was no sign of Adele or the brutal owner of Griff
  Towers. He searched the library again, and passed through into the little
  drawing-room, where a table was laid for two. The cloth was wet with spilt
  wine; one glass was half empty&mdash;but the two for whom the table was laid
  had vanished. They must have gone out of the front door &mdash;whither?</p>

  <p>He was standing tense, his mind concentrated upon a problem that was more
  vital to him than life itself, when he heard a sound that came from the
  direction of Bhag's den. And then there appeared in the door way the
  monstrous ape himself. He was bleeding from a wound in the shoulder; the
  blood fell drip-drip-drip as he stood clutching in his two great hands
  something that seemed like a bundle of rags. As Michael looked, the room
  rocked before his eyes.</p>

  <p>The tattered, stained garment that Bhag held was the cloak that Adele
  Leamington had worn!</p>

  <p>For a second Bhag glared at the man who he knew was his enemy, and then,
  dropping the cloak, he shrank back toward his quarters, his teeth bared.</p>

  <p>Three times Michael's automatic spat, and the great, man-like thing
  disappeared in a flash&mdash;and the door closed with a click.</p>

  <p>Knebworth had been a witness of the scene. It was he who ran forward and
  picked up the cloak that the ape had dropped.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was hers,", he said huskily, and a horrible thought chilled
  him.</p>

  <p>Michael had opened the door of the den, and, pistol in hand, dashed
  through the opening. Knebworth dared not follow. He stood petrified, waiting,
  and then Michael reappeared.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing here," he said.</p>

  <p>"Nothing?" asked Jack Knebworth in a whisper. "Thank God!"</p>

  <p>"Bhag has gone&mdash;I think I may have hit him; there is a trail of
  blood, but I may not be responsible for that. He had been shot recently." He
  pointed to stains on the floor. "He wasn't shot when I saw him last."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen him before tonight?"</p>

  <p>Michael nodded.</p>

  <p>"For three nights he has been haunting Longvale's house."</p>

  <p>"Longvale's!"</p>

  <p>Where was Adele? That was the one dominant one thought uppermost in
  Michael Brixan's mind. And where was the baronet? What was the meaning of
  that open door? None of the servants could tell him, and for some reason he
  saw that they were speaking the truth. Only Penne and the girl&mdash;and this
  great ape&mdash;knew, unless&mdash;</p>

  <p>He hurried back to where he had left a detective trying to revive the
  unconscious Stella Mendoza.</p>

  <p>"She has passed from one fainting-fit to another," said the officer. "I
  can get nothing out of her except that once she said, 'Kill him, Adele!'</p>

  <p>"Then she has seen her!" said Michael.</p>

  <p>One of the officers he had left outside to watch the building had a report
  to make. He had seen a dark figure climb the wall and disappear apparently
  through the solid brickwork. A few minutes later it had come out again.</p>

  <p>"That was Bhag," said Michael. "I knew he was not here when we arrived. He
  must have come in through the opening while we were upstairs."</p>

  <p>The car that had carried Adele had been found. It was Stella's, and at
  first Michael suspected that the girl was a party to the abduction. He learnt
  afterwards that, whilst the woman's chauffeur had been in the kitchen,
  virtually a prisoner, Penne himself had driven the car to the girl's house,
  and it was the sight of the machine, which she knew belonged to Stella, that
  had lulled any suspicions she may have had.</p>

  <p>Michael was in a condition bordering upon frenzy. The Head-Hunter and his
  capture was insignificant compared with the safety of the girl.</p>

  <p>"If I don't find her I shall go mad!" he said.</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth had opened his lips to answer when there came a startling
  interruption. Borne on the still night air came a scream of agony which
  turned the director's blood to ice.</p>

  <p>"Help, help!"</p>

  <p>Shrill as was the cry, Michael knew that it was the voice of a man, and
  knew that that man was Gregory Penne!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap35"
     id="chap35">XXXV. WHAT HAPPENED TO ADELE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE were moments when Adele Leamington had doubts as to
  her fitness for the profession she had entered; and never were those periods
  of doubt more poignant than when she tried to fix her mind upon the written
  directions of the scenario. She blamed Michael, and was immediately
  repentant. She blamed herself more freely; and at last she gave up the
  struggle, rolled up the manuscript book, and, putting an elastic band about
  it, thrust it under her pillow and prepared for bed. She had rid herself of
  skirt and blouse when the summons came.</p>

  <p>"From Mr. Knebworth?" she said in surprise. "At this time of night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss. He's going to make a big alteration tomorrow and he wants to
  see you at once. He has sent his car. Miss Mendoza is coming into the
  cast."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she said faintly.</p>

  <p>Then she had been a failure after all, and had lived in a fool's paradise
  for these past days.</p>

  <p>"I'll come at once," she said.</p>

  <p>Her fingers trembled as she fastened her dress, and she hated herself for
  such a display of weakness. Perhaps Stella was not coming into the cast in
  her old part; perhaps some new character had been written in; perhaps it was
  not for "Roselle" at all that she had been re-engaged. These and other
  speculations rioted in her mind; and she was in the passage and the door was
  opened when she remembered that Jack Knebworth would want the manuscript. She
  ran upstairs, and, by an aberration of memory, forgot entirely where the
  script had been left. At last, in despair, she went down to the landlady.</p>

  <p>"I have left some manuscripts which are rather important. Would you bring
  them up to Mr. Knebworth's house when you find them? They're in a little
  brown jacket&mdash;" She described the appearance as well as she could.</p>

  <p>It was Stella Mendoza's car; she recognized the machine with a pang. So
  Jack and she were reconciled!</p>

  <p>In a minute she was inside the machine, the door closed behind her, and
  was sitting by the driver, who did not speak.</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Brixan with Mr. Knebworth?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He did not reply. She thought he had not heard her, until he turned with a
  wide sweep and set the car going in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>"This is not the way to Mr. Knebworth's," she said in alarm. "Don't you
  know the way?"</p>

  <p>Still he made no reply. The machine gathered speed, passed down a long,
  dark street, and turned into a country lane.</p>

  <p>"Stop the car at once!" she said, terrified, and put her hand on the
  handle of the door.</p>

  <p>Instantly her arm was gripped.</p>

  <p>"My dear, you're going to injure your pretty little body, and probably
  spoil your beautiful face, if you attempt to get out while the car is in
  motion," he said.</p>

  <p>"Sir Gregory!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Now don't make a fuss," said Gregory. There was no mistaking the elation
  in his voice. "You're coming up to have a little bit of supper with me. I've
  asked you often enough, and now you're going willy-nilly! Stella's there, so
  there's nothing to be afraid of."</p>

  <p>She held down her fears with an effort.</p>

  <p>"Sir Gregory, you will take me back at once to my lodgings," she said.
  "This is disgraceful of you!"</p>

  <p>He chuckled loudly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing's going to happen to you; nobody's going to hurt you, and you'll
  be delivered safe and sound; but you're going to have supper with me first,
  little darling. And if you make a fuss, I'm going to turn the car into the
  first tree I see and smash us all up!"</p>

  <p>He was drunk&mdash;drunk not only with wine, but with the lust of power.
  Gregory had achieved his object, and would stop at nothing now.</p>

  <p>Was Stella there? She did not believe him. And yet it might be true. She
  grasped at the straw which Stella's presence offered.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," grunted Gregory, as he stopped the car before the Towers
  door and slipped out on to the gravel.</p>

  <p>Before she realized what he was doing, he had lifted her in his arms,
  though she struggled desperately.</p>

  <p>"If you scream I'll kiss you," growled his voice in her ear, and she lay
  passive.</p>

  <p>The door opened instantly. She looked down at the servant standing
  stolidly in the hall as Gregory carried her up the wide stairway, and
  wondered what help might come from him. Presently Penne set her down on her
  feet and, opening a door, thrust her in.</p>

  <p>"Here's your friend, Stella," he said. "Say the good word for me! Knock
  some sense into her head if you can. I'll come back in ten minutes, and we'll
  have the grandest little wedding-supper that any bridegroom ever had."</p>

  <p>The door was banged and locked upon her before she realized there was
  another woman in the room. It was Stella. Her heart rose at the sight of the
  girl's white face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Miss Mendoza," she said breathlessly, "thank God you're here!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap36"
     id="chap36">XXXVI. THE ESCAPE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"DON'T start thanking God too soon," said Stella with
  ominous calm. "Oh, you little fool, why did you come here?"</p>

  <p>"He brought me. I didn't want to come," said Adele.</p>

  <p>She was half hysterical in her fright. She tried hard to imitate the calm
  of her companion, biting her quivering lips to keep them still, and after a
  while she was calm enough to tell what had happened. Stella's face
  clouded.</p>

  <p>"Of course, he took my car," she said, speaking to herself, "and he has
  caught the chauffeur, as he said he would. Oh, my God!"</p>

  <p>"What will he do?" asked Adele in a whisper.</p>

  <p>Stella's fine eyes turned on the girl.</p>

  <p>"What do you think he will do?" she asked significantly. "He's a
  beast&mdash;the kind of beast you seldom meet except in books&mdash;and
  locked rooms. He'll have no more mercy on you than Bhag would have on
  you."</p>

  <p>"If Michael knows, he will kill him."</p>

  <p>"Michael? Oh, Brixan, you mean?" said Stella with newly awakened interest.
  "Is he fond of you? Is that why he hangs around the lot? That never struck me
  before. But what does he care about Michael or any other, man? He can
  run&mdash;his yacht is at Southampton, and he depends a lot upon his wealth
  to get him out of these kind of scrapes. And he knows that decent women
  shrink from appearance in a police-court. Oh, he's got all sorts of defences.
  He's a worm, but a scaly worm!"</p>

  <p>"What shall I do?"</p>

  <p>Stella was walking up and down the narrow apartment, her hands clasped
  before her, her eyes sunk to the ground.</p>

  <p>"I don't think he'll hurt me." And then, inconsequently, she went off at a
  tangent: "I saw a tramp at that window two hours ago."</p>

  <p>"A tramp?" said the bewildered girl.</p>

  <p>Stella nodded.</p>

  <p>"It scared me terribly, until I remembered his eyes. They were Brixan's
  eyes, though you'd never guess it, the make-up was so wonderful."</p>

  <p>"Michael? Is he here?" asked the girl eagerly.</p>

  <p>"He's somewhere around. That is your salvation, and there's another." She
  took down from a shelf a small Browning. "Did you ever fire a pistol?"</p>

  <p>The girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have to, in one scene," she said, a little awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"Of course! Well, this is loaded. That"&mdash;she pointed&mdash;"is the
  safety-catch. Push it down with your thumb before you start to use it. You
  had better kill Penne&mdash;better for you, and better for him, I think."</p>

  <p>The girl shrank back in horror.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, no!"</p>

  <p>"Put it in your pocket&mdash;have you a pocket?" There was one inside the
  blue cloak the girl was wearing, and into this Stella dropped the pistol.
  "You don't know what sort of sacrifice I'm making," she said frankly; "and it
  isn't as though I'm doing it for somebody I'm fond of, because I'm not
  particularly fond of you, Adele Leamington. But I wouldn't be fit to live if
  I let that brute get you without a struggle."</p>

  <p>And then impulsively she stooped forward and kissed the girl, and Adele
  put her arms about her neck and clung to her for a second.</p>

  <p>"He's coming," whispered Stella Mendoza, and stepped back with a
  gesture.</p>

  <p>It was Gregory&mdash;Gregory in his scarlet pyjama jacket and purple
  dressing-gown, his face aflame, his eyes fired with excitement.</p>

  <p>"Come on, you!" He crooked his finger. "Not you, Mendoza: you stay here,
  eh? You can see her after, perhaps&mdash;after supper."</p>

  <p>He leered down at the shrinking girl.</p>

  <p>"Nobody's going to hurt you. Leave your cloak here."</p>

  <p>"No, I'll wear it," she said.</p>

  <p>Her hand went instinctively to the butt of the pistol and closed upon
  it.</p>

  <p>"All right, come as you are. It makes no difference to me."</p>

  <p>He held her tightly by the hand and marched by her side, surprised and
  pleased that she offered so little resistance. Down into the hall they went,
  and then to the little drawing-room adjoining his study. He flung open the
  door and showed her the gaily decorated table, pushing her into the room
  before him.</p>

  <p>"Wine and a kiss!" he roared, as he pulled the cork from a
  champagne-bottle and sent the amber fluid splashing upon the spotless
  tablecloth. "Wine and a kiss!" He splashed the glass out to her so that it
  spilt and trickled down her cloak.</p>

  <p>She shook her head mutely.</p>

  <p>"Drink!" he snarled, and she touched the glass with her lips.</p>

  <p>Then, before she could realize what had happened, she was in his arms, his
  great face pressed down to hers. She tried to escape from the encirclement of
  his embrace, successfully averted her mouth and felt his hot lips pressing
  against her cheek.</p>

  <p>Presently he let her go, and, staggering to the door, kicked it shut. His
  fingers were closing on the key handle when: "If you turn that key I'll kill
  you!"</p>

  <p>He looked up in ludicrous surprise, and, at the sight of the pistol in the
  girl's hand, his big hands waved before his face in a gesture of fear.</p>

  <p>"Put it down, you fool!" he squealed. "Put it down! Don't you know what
  you're doing? The damned thing may go off by accident!"</p>

  <p>"It will not go off by accident," she said. "Open that door."</p>

  <p>He hesitated for a moment, and then her thumb tightened on the
  safety-catch, and he must have seen the movement.</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot, don't shoot!" he screamed, and flung the door wide open
  "Wait, you fool! Don't go out. Bhag is there. Bhag will get you. Stay with
  me. I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But she was flying down the corridor. She slipped on a loose rug in the
  hall but recovered herself. Her trembling hands were working at the bolts and
  chains; the door swung open and in another instant she was in the
  open&mdash;free.</p>

  <p>Sir Gregory followed her. The shock of her escape had sobered him, and all
  the tragic consequences which might follow came crowding in upon him, until
  his very soul writhed in fear. Dashing back to his study, he opened his safe,
  took out a bundle of notes. These he thrust into the pocket of a fur-lined
  overcoat that was hanging in a cupboard and put it on. He changed his
  slippers for thick shoes, and then bethought him of Bhag. He opened the den,
  but Bhag was not there, and he raised his shaking fingers to his lips. If
  Bhag caught her!</p>

  <p>Some glimmering of a lost manhood stirred dully in his mind. He must first
  be sure of Bhag. He went out into the darkness in search of his strange and
  horrible servant. Putting both hands to his mouth, he emitted a long and
  painful howl, the call that Bhag had never yet disobeyed, and then waited.
  There was no answer. Again he sent forth the melancholy sound, but, if Bhag
  heard him, for the first time in his life he did not obey.</p>

  <p>Gregory Penne stood in a sweat of fear, but, so standing, recovered some
  of his balance. There was time to change. He went up to his ornate bedroom,
  flung off his pyjamas, and in a short space of time was down again in the
  dark grounds, seeking for the ape.</p>

  <p>Dressed, he felt more of a man. A long glass of whisky restored some of
  his confidence. He rang for the servant who was in charge of his car.</p>

  <p>"Have the machine by the postern gate," he said. "Get it there at once.
  See that the gate is open: I may have to leave tonight."</p>

  <p>That he would be arrested he did not doubt. Not all his wealth, his
  position, the pull he had in the county, could save him. This latest deed of
  his was something more than eccentricity.</p>

  <p>Then he remembered that Stella Mendoza was still in the house, and went up
  to see her. A glance at his face told her that something unusual had
  happened.</p>

  <p>"Where is Adele?" she asked instantly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. She escaped&mdash;she had a pistol. Bhag went after her.
  God knows what will happen if he finds her. He'll tear her limb from limb.
  What's that?"</p>

  <p>It was the faint sound of a pistol-shot at a distance, and it came from
  the back of the house.</p>

  <p>"Poachers," said Gregory uneasily. "Listen, I'm going."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"That's no damned business of yours," he snarled. "Here's some money." He
  thrust some notes into her hand.</p>

  <p>"What have you done?" she whispered in horror.</p>

  <p>"I've done nothing, I tell you!" he stormed. "But they'll take me for it.
  I'm going to get to the yacht. You'd better clear before they come."</p>

  <p>She was collecting her hat and gloves when she heard the door close and
  the key turn. Mechanically he had locked her in, and mechanically took no
  heed of her beating hand upon the panel of the door.</p>

  <p>Griff Towers stood on high ground and commanded a view of the by-road from
  Chichester. As he stood in front of the house, hoping against hope that he
  would see the ape, he saw instead two lights come rapidly along the road.</p>

  <p>"The police!" he croaked, and went blundering across the kitchen garden to
  the gate.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap37"
     id="chap37">XXXVII. AT THE TOWER AGAIN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ADELE went flying down the drive, intent only upon one
  object &mdash;to escape from this horrible house. The gates were closed, the
  lodge was in darkness, and she strove desperately to unfasten the iron catch,
  but it held.</p>

  <p>Looking back toward the oblong of light which represented the tower door,
  she was dimly aware of a figure moving stealthily along the grass that
  bordered each side of the roadway. For a moment she thought it was Gregory
  Penne, and then the true explanation of that skulking shape came to her, and
  she nearly dropped. It was Bhag!</p>

  <p>She moved as quietly as she could along the side of the wall, creeping
  from bush to bush; but he had seen her, and came in pursuit, moving slowly,
  cautiously, as though he was not quite sure that she was legitimate prey.
  Perhaps there was another gate, she thought, and continued, glancing over her
  shoulder from time to time, and gripping the little pistol in her hand with
  such intensity that it was slippery with perspiration before she had gone a
  hundred yards.</p>

  <p>Now she left the cover of the wall and came across a meadow, and at first
  she thought that she had slipped her pursuer. But Bhag seldom went into the
  open, and presently she saw him again. He was parallel with her, walking
  under the wall, and showing no sign of hurry. Perhaps, she thought, if she
  continued he would drop his pursuit and go off. It might be curiosity that
  kept him on her trail. But this hope was disappointed. She crossed a stile
  and followed a path until she realized it was bringing her nearer and nearer
  to the wall where her watcher was keeping pace with her. As soon as she
  realized this, she turned abruptly from the path, and found herself walking
  through dew-laden grasses. She was wet to the knees before she had gone far,
  but she did not even know this&mdash;Bhag had left cover and was following
  her into the open!</p>

  <p>She wondered if the grounds were entirely enclosed by a wall, and was
  relieved when she came to a low fence. Stumbling down a bank on to a road
  which was evidently the eastern boundary of the property, she ran at full
  speed, though where the road led she could not guess. Glancing back, she saw,
  to her horror, that Bhag was following, yet making no attempt to decrease the
  distance which separated them.</p>

  <p>And then, far away, she saw the lights of a cottage. They seemed close at
  hand, but were in reality more than two miles distant. With a sob of
  thankfulness she turned from the road and ran up a gentle slope, only to
  discover, to her dismay, when she reached the crest, that the lights seemed
  as far away as ever. Looking back, she saw Bhag, his green eyes gleaming in
  the darkness.</p>

  <p>Where was she? Glancing round, she found an answer. Ahead and to the left
  was the squat outline of old Griff Tower.</p>

  <p>And then, for some reason, Bhag dropped his role of interested watcher,
  and, with a dog-like growl, leapt at her. She flew upward toward the tower,
  her breath coming in sobs, her heart thumping so that she felt every moment
  she would drop from sheer exhaustion. A hand clutched at her cloak and tore
  it from her. That gave her a moment's respite. She must face her enemy, or
  she herself must perish.</p>

  <p>Spinning round, her shaking pistol raised, she confronted the monster, who
  was growling and tearing at the clothing in his hand. Again he crouched to
  spring, and she pressed the trigger. The unexpected loudness of the explosion
  so startled her that she nearly dropped the pistol. With a howl of anguish he
  fell, gripping at his wounded shoulder, but rose again immediately. And then
  he began to move backward, watching her all the time.</p>

  <p>What should she do? In her present position he might creep from bush to
  bush and pounce upon her at any moment. She looked up at the tower. If she
  could reach the top! And then she remembered the ladder that Jack Knebworth
  had left behind. But that would have been collected.</p>

  <p>She moved stealthily, keeping her eye upon the ape, and though he was
  motionless, she knew he was watching her. Then, groping in the grass, her
  fingers touched the light ladder, and she lifted it without difficulty and
  placed it against the wall. She had heard Jack say that the ape could not
  have climbed the tower from the outside without assistance, though it had
  been an easy matter, with the aid of the trees growing against the wall
  inside, for him to get out.</p>

  <p>Bhag was still visible; the dull glow of his eyes was dreadful to see.
  With a wild run she reached the top of the ladder and began pulling it up
  after her. Bhag crept nearer and nearer till he came to the foot of the
  tower, made three ineffectual efforts to scale the wall and failed. She heard
  his twitter of rage, and guided the ladder to the inside of the tower.</p>

  <p>For a long time they sat looking at each other, the orang-outang and the
  girl. And then Bhag crept away. She followed him as far as her keen eyes
  could distinguish his ungainly shape, waiting until she was certain he had
  gone, and then reached for the ladder. The lower rung must have caught in one
  of the bushes below. She tugged, tugged again, tugged for the third time, and
  it came away so smoothly that she lost her balance. For a second she was
  holding the top of the wall with one hand, the ladder with the other; then,
  half sliding, half tumbling, she came down with a run, and picked herself up
  breathless. She could have laughed at the mishap but for the eerie loneliness
  of her new surroundings. She tried to erect the ladder again, but in the dark
  it was impossible to get a firm foundation.</p>

  <p>There must be small stones somewhere about, and she began to look out for
  them. She reached the bottom of the circular depression, and, pushing aside a
  bush to make further progress, feeling all the time with her feet for a
  suitable prop, suddenly she slipped. She was dropping down a sloping shaft
  into the depths of the earth!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap38"
     id="chap38">XXXVIII. THE CAVERN OF BONES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DOWN, down, down she fell, one hand clawing wildly at the
  soft earth, the other clenching unconsciously at the tiny pistol. She was
  rolling down a steep slope. Once her feet came violently and painfully into
  contact with an out-jutting rock, and the shock and the pain of it turned her
  sick and faint. Whither she was going she dared not think. It seemed an
  eternity before, at last, she struck a level floor and, rolling over and
  over, was brought up against a rocky wall with a jolt that shook the breath
  from her body.</p>

  <p>Eternity it seemed, yet it could not have been more than a few seconds.
  For five minutes she lay, recovering, on the rock floor. She got up with a
  grimace of pain, felt her hurt ankle, and worked her foot to discover if
  anything was broken. Looking up, she saw a pale star above, and, guessing
  that it was the opening through which she had fallen, attempted to climb
  back; but with every step she took the soft earth gave under her feet and she
  slipped back again.</p>

  <p>She had lost a shoe: that was the first tangible truth that asserted
  itself. She groped round in the darkness and found it after a while, half
  embedded in the earth. She shook it empty, dusted her stockinged foot, and
  put it on. Then she sat down to wonder what she should do next. She guessed
  that, with the coming of day, she would be able to examine her surroundings,
  and she must wait, with what philosophy she could summon, for the morning to
  break.</p>

  <p>It was then that she became conscious that she was still gripping the
  earth-caked Browning, and, with a half-smile, she cleaned it as best she
  could, pressed down the safety-catch, and, putting the weapon inside her
  blouse, thrust its blunt nose into the waistband of her skirt.</p>

  <p>The mystery of Bhag's reappearance was no a mystery no longer. He had been
  hiding in the cave, though it was her imagination that supplied the queer
  animal scent which was peculiarly his.</p>

  <p>How far did the cave extend? She peered left and right, but could see
  nothing; then, groping cautiously, feeling every inch of her way, her hand
  struck a stone pillar, and she withdrew it quickly, for it was wet and
  clammy.</p>

  <p>And then she made a discovery of the greatest importance to her. She was
  feeling along the wall when her hand went into a niche, and by the surface of
  its shelf she knew it was man-fashioned. She put her hand farther along, and
  her heart leapt as she touched something which had a familiar and homely
  feel. It was a lantern. Her other hand went up, and presently she opened its
  glass door and felt a length of candle, and, at the bottom of the lantern, a
  small box of matches.</p>

  <p>It was no miracle, as she was to learn; but for the moment it seemed that
  that possibility of light had come in answer to her unspoken prayers.
  Striking a match with a hand that shook so that the light went out
  immediately, she at last succeeded in kindling the wick. The candle was new,
  and at first its light was feeble; but presently the wax began to burn, and,
  closing the lantern door, her surroundings came into view.</p>

  <p>She was in a narrow cave, from the roof of which hung innumerable
  stalactites; but the dripping water which is inseparable from this queer
  formation was absent at the foot of the opening where she had tumbled.
  Farther along the floor was wet, and a tiny stream of water ran in a sort of
  naturally carved tunnel on one side of the path. Here, where the cave
  broadened, the stalactites were many, and left and right, at such regular
  intervals and of such even shape that they seemed almost to have been
  sculptured by human agency, were little caves within caves, narrow openings
  that revealed, in the light of her lantern, the splendour of nature's
  treasures. Fairylike grottoes, rich with delicate stone traceries; tiny lakes
  that sparkled in the light of the lantern. Broader and broader grew the cave,
  until she stood in a huge chamber that appeared to be festooned with frozen
  lace. And here the floor was littered with queer white sticks. There were
  thousands of them, of every conceivable shape and size. They showed whitely
  in the gleam of her lantern, in the crevices of the rocks. She stooped and
  picked one up, dropping it quickly with a cry of horror. They were human
  bones!</p>

  <p>With a shuddering gasp she half walked, half ran across the great cavern,
  which began to narrow again and assumed the appearance of that portion of the
  cave into which she had fallen. And here she saw, in another niche, a second
  lantern, with new candle and matches. Who had placed them here? The first
  lantern she had not dared to think about: it belonged to the miraculous
  category. But the second brought her up with a jerk. Who had placed these
  lanterns at intervals along the wall of the cave, as if in preparation for an
  expected emergency? There must be somebody who lived down here. She breathed
  a little more quickly at the thought.</p>

  <p>Going on slowly, she examined every foot of the way, the second lantern,
  unlighted, slung on her arm. At one part, the floor was flooded with running
  water; at another, she had to wade through a little subterranean ford, where
  the water came over her ankles. And now the cave was curving imperceptibly to
  the right. From time to time she stopped and listened, hoping to hear the
  sound of a human voice, and yet fearing. The roof of the cave came lower.
  There were signs in the roof that the stalactites had been knocked off to
  afford head room for the mysterious person who haunted these underground
  chambers.</p>

  <p>Once she stopped, her heart thumping painfully at the sound of footsteps.
  They passed over her head, and then came a curious humming sound that grew in
  intensity, passed and faded. A motor-car! She was under the road! Of course,
  old Griff Tower stood upon the hillside. She was now near the road level, and
  possibly eight or nine feet above her the stars were shining. She looked
  wistfully at the ragged surface of the roof, and, steeling herself against
  the terrors that rose within her, she went on. She had need of nerve, need of
  courage beyond the ordinary.</p>

  <p>The cave passage turned abruptly; the little grotto openings in the wall
  occurred again. Suddenly she stopped dead. The light of the lantern showed
  into one of the grottos. Two men lay side by side.</p>

  <p>She stifled the scream that rose to her lips, pressing her hands tight
  upon her mouth, her eyes shut tightly to hide the sight. They were
  dead&mdash;headless! Lying in a shallow pool, the petrifying water came
  dripping down upon them, as it would drip down for everlasting until these
  pitiful things were stone.</p>

  <p>For a long time she dared not move, dared not open her eyes, but at last
  her will conquered, and she looked with outward calm upon a sight that froze
  her very marrow. The next grotto was similarly tenanted, only this time there
  was one man. And, then, when she was on the point of sinking under the shock,
  a tiny point of light appeared in the gloom ahead. It moved and swayed, and
  there came to her the sound of a fearful laugh.</p>

  <p>She acted instantly. Pulling open the door of the lantern, she stooped and
  blew it out, and stood, leaning against the wall of the cave, oblivious to
  the grisly relics that surrounded her, conscious only of the danger which lay
  ahead. Then a brighter light blazed up, and another, till the distant spaces
  wherein they burnt were as bright as day. As she stood wondering, there came
  to her a squeal of mortal agony and a whining voice that cried:</p>

  <p>"Help! Oh God! Help! Brixan, I am not fit to die!"</p>

  <p>It was the voice of Sir Gregory Penne.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap39"
     id="chap39">XXXIX. MICHAEL KNOWS FOR SURE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was that same voice that had brought Michael Brixan
  racing across the garden to the postern gate. A car stood outside, its lights
  dimmed. Standing by its bonnet was a frightened little brown man who had
  brought the machine to the place.</p>

  <p>"Where is your master?" asked Michael quickly.</p>

  <p>The man pointed.</p>

  <p>"He went that way," he quavered. "There was a devil in the big
  machine&mdash;it would not move when he stamped on the little pedal."</p>

  <p>Michael guessed what had happened. At the last moment, by one of those
  queer mischances which haunt the just and the unjust, the engine had failed
  him and he had fled on foot.</p>

  <p>"Which way did he go?"</p>

  <p>Again the man pointed.</p>

  <p>"He ran," he said simply.</p>

  <p>Michael turned to the detective who was with him. "Stay here: he may
  return. Arrest him immediately and put the irons on him. He's probably armed,
  and he may be suicidal; we can't afford to take any risks."</p>

  <p>He had been so often across what he had named the "Back Field" that he
  could find his way blindfolded, and he ran at top speed till he came to the
  stile and to the road. Sir Gregory was nowhere in sight. Fifty yards along
  the road the lights gleamed cheerily from an upper window in Mr. Longvale's
  house, and Michael bent his footsteps in that direction.</p>

  <p>Still no sight of the man, and he turned through the gate and knocked at
  the door, which was almost immediately opened by the old gentleman himself.
  He wore a silken gown, tied with a sash about the middle, a picture of
  comfort, Michael thought.</p>

  <p>"Who's that?" asked Mr. Sampson Longvale, peering out into the darkness.
  "Why, bless my life, it's Mr. Brixan, the officer of the law! Come in, come
  in, sir."</p>

  <p>He opened the door wide and Michael passed into the sitting-room, with its
  inevitable two candles, augmented now by a small silver reading-lamp that
  burnt some sort of petrol vapour.</p>

  <p>"No trouble at the Towers, I trust?" said Mr. Longvale anxiously.</p>

  <p>"There was a little trouble," said Michael carefully. "Have you by any
  chance seen Sir Gregory Penne?"</p>

  <p>The old man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I found the night rather too chilly for my usual garden ramble," he said,
  "so I have seen none of the exciting events which seem inevitably to
  accompany the hours of darkness in these times. Has anything happened to
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I hope not," said Michael quietly. "I hope, for everybody's sake,
  that&mdash;nothing has happened to him."</p>

  <p>He walked across and leant his elbows on the mantelpiece, looking up at
  the painting above his head.</p>

  <p>"Do you admire my relative?" beamed Mr. Longvale.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I admire him. He was certainly a wonderfully handsome
  old gentleman."</p>

  <p>Mr. Longvale inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"You have read his memoirs!"</p>

  <p>Michael nodded, and the old man did not seem in any way surprised.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have read what purport to be his memoirs," said Michael quietly,
  "but latter-day opinion is that they are not authentic."</p>

  <p>Mr. Longvale shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Personally, I believe every word of them," he said. "My uncle was a man
  of considerable education."</p>

  <p>It would have amazed Jack Knebworth to know that the man who had rushed
  hotfoot from the tower in search of a possible murderer was at that moment
  calmly discussing biography; yet such was the incongruous, unbelievable
  fact.</p>

  <p>"I sometimes feel that you think too much about your uncle, Mr. Longvale,"
  said Michael gently.</p>

  <p>The old gentleman frowned.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;?</p>

  <p>"I mean that such a subject may become an obsession, and a very unhealthy
  obsession, and such hero-worship may lead a man to do things which no sane
  man would do."</p>

  <p>"Can one do better than imitate the deeds of the great?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not if your sense of values hasn't got all tangled up, and you ascribe to
  him virtues which are not virtues&mdash;unless duty is a virtue&mdash;and
  confuse that which is great with that which is terrible."</p>

  <p>Michael turned and, resting his palms on the table, looked across to the
  old man who confronted him.</p>

  <p>"I want you to come with me into Chichester this evening."</p>

  <p>"Why?" The question was asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Because I think you're a sick man, that you ought to have care."</p>

  <p>The old man laughed and drew himself even more erect.</p>

  <p>"Sick? I was never better in my life, my dear sir, never fitter, never
  stronger!"</p>

  <p>And he looked all that he said. His height, the breadth of his shoulders,
  the healthy glow of his cheeks, all spoke of physical fitness.</p>

  <p>A long pause, and then:</p>

  <p>"Where is Gregory Penne?" asked Michael, emphasizing every word.</p>

  <p>"I haven't the slightest idea." The old man's eyes met his without
  wavering. "We were talking about my great-uncle. You know him, of course?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I knew him the first time I saw his picture, and I thought I had betrayed
  my knowledge, but apparently I did not. Your great-uncle"&mdash;Michael spoke
  deliberately&mdash;"was Sanson, otherwise Longval, hereditary executioner of
  France!"</p>

  <p>Longvale looked at him in genuine astonishment. Such a silence followed
  that the ticking of a distant clock sounded distinctly.</p>

  <p>"Your uncle has many achievements to his credit. He hanged three men on a
  gallows sixty feet high, unless my memory is at fault. His hand struck off
  the head of Louis of France and his consort Marie-Antoinette."</p>

  <p>The look of pride in the old man's face was startling. His eyes kindled,
  he seemed to grow in height.</p>

  <p>"By what fantastic freak of fate you come to have settled in England, what
  queer kink of mind decided you secretly to carry on the profession of Sanson
  and seek far and wide for poor, helpless wretches to destroy, I do not
  know."</p>

  <p>Michael did not raise his voice, he spoke in a calm, conversational tone;
  and in the same way did Longvale reply.</p>

  <p>"Is it not better," he said gently, "that a man should pass out of life
  through no act of his own than that he should commit the unpardonable crime
  of self-murder? Have I not been a benefactor to men who dared not take their
  own lives?"</p>

  <p>"To Lawley Foss?" suggested Michael, his grave eyes fixed on the
  other.</p>

  <p>"He was a traitor, a vulgar blackmailer, a man who sought to use the
  knowledge which had accidentally come to him to extract money from me."</p>

  <p>"Where is Gregory Penne?"</p>

  <p>A slow smile dawned on the man's face.</p>

  <p>"You will not believe me? That is ungentle, sir! I have not seen Sir
  Gregory."</p>

  <p>Michael pointed to the hearth, where a cigarette was still
  smouldering.</p>

  <p>"There is that," he said. "There are his muddy footprints on the carpet of
  this room. There is the cry I heard. Where is he?"</p>

  <p>Within reach of his hand was his heavy-calibred Browning. A move on the
  old man's part and he would lie maimed on the ground. Michael was dealing
  with a homicidal lunatic of the most dangerous type, and would not hesitate
  to shoot.</p>

  <p>But the old man showed no sign of antagonism. His voice was gentleness
  itself. He seemed to feel and express a pride in crimes which, to his brain,
  were not crimes at all.</p>

  <p>"If you really wish me to go into Chichester with you tonight, of course I
  will go," he said. "You may be right in your own estimation, even in the
  estimation of your superiors, but in ending my work you are rendering a cruel
  disservice to miserable humanity, to serve which I have spent thousands of
  pounds. But I bear no malice."</p>

  <p>He took a bottle from the long oaken buffet against the wall, selected two
  glasses with scrupulous care, and filled them from the bottle.</p>

  <p>"We will drink our mutual good health," he said with his old courtesy,
  and, lifting his glass to his lips, drank it with that show of enjoyment with
  which the old-time lovers of wine marked their approval of rare vintages.</p>

  <p>"You're not drinking!" he said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Somebody else has drunk."</p>

  <p>There was a glass half empty on the buffet: Michael saw it for the first
  time.</p>

  <p>"He did not seem to enjoy the wine."</p>

  <p>Mr. Longvale sighed.</p>

  <p>"Very few people understand wine," he said, dusting a speck from his coat.
  Then, drawing a silk handkerchief from his pocket, he stooped and dusted his
  boots daintily.</p>

  <p>Michael was standing on a strip of hearthrug in front of the fireplace,
  his hand on his gun, tense but prepared for the moment of trial. Whence the
  danger would come, what form it would take, he could not guess. But danger
  was there&mdash;danger terrible and ruthless, emphasized rather than relieved
  by the suavity of the old man's tone &mdash;he felt in the creep of his
  flesh.</p>

  <p>"You see, my dear sir," Longvale went on, still dusting his boots.</p>

  <p>And then, before Michael could realize what had happened, he had grasped
  the end of the rug on which the detective was standing and pulled it with a
  quick jerk towards him. Before he could balance himself, Michael had fallen
  with a crash to the floor, his head striking the oaken panelling, his pistol
  sliding along the polished floor. In a flash, the old man was on him, had
  flung him over on his face and dragged his hands behind him. Michael tried to
  struggle, but he was as a child in that powerful grip, placed at such a
  disadvantage as he was. He felt the touch of cold steel on his wrists, there
  was a click, and, exerting all his strength, he tried to pull his other hand
  away. But gradually, slowly, it was forced back, and the second cuff
  snapped.</p>

  <p>There were footsteps on the path outside the cottage. The old man
  straightened himself to pull off his silken gown and wrapped it round and
  round the detective's head, and then a knock came at the door. One glance to
  see that his prisoner was safe, and Longvale extinguished the lamp, blew out
  one of the candles, and carried the other into the passage. He was in his
  shirt-sleeves, and the Scotland Yard officer, who was the caller, apologized
  for disturbing a man who had apparently been brought down from his bedroom to
  answer the knock.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Mr. Brixan?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brixan? Yes, he was here a few minutes ago. He went on to
  Chichester."</p>

  <p>Michael heard the voices, but could not distinguish what was being said.
  The silken wrapper about his head was suffocating him, and he was losing his
  senses when the old man came back alone, unfastened the gown, and put it on
  himself.</p>

  <p>"If you make a noise I will sew your lips together," he said, so naturally
  and good-naturedly that it seemed impossible he would carry his threat into
  execution. But Michael knew that he was giving chapter and verse; he was
  threatening that which his ancestor had often performed. That beautiful old
  man, nicknamed by the gallants of Louis' Court "Monsieur de Paris", had
  broken and hanged and beheaded, and he had also tortured, men. There were
  smoke-blackened rooms in the old Bastille where that venerable old headsman
  had performed nameless duties without blenching.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry in many ways that you must go on," said the old man, with
  genuine regret in his voice, "You are a young man for whom I have a great
  deal of respect. The law to me is sacred, and its officers have an especially
  privileged place in my affections."</p>

  <p>He pulled open a drawer of the buffet and took out a large serviette,
  folded it with great care and fixed it tightly about Michael's mouth. Then he
  raised him up and sat him on a chair.</p>

  <p>"If I were a young and agile man, I would have a jest which would have
  pleased my uncle Charles Henry. I would fix your head the top of the gates of
  Scotland Yard! I've often examined the gates with that idea in my mind. Not
  that I thought of you, but that some day providence might send me a very high
  official, a Minister, even a Prime Minister. My uncle, as you know, was
  privileged to destroy kings and leaders of parties&mdash;Danton, Robespierre,
  every great leader save Marat. Danton was the greatest of them all."</p>

  <p>There was an excellent reason why Michael should not answer. But he was
  his own cool self again, and though his head was aching from the violent
  knock it had received, his mind was clear. He was waiting now for the next
  move, and suspected he would not be kept waiting long. What scenes had this
  long dining-room witnessed! What moments of agony, mental and physical! It
  was the very antechamber to death.</p>

  <p>Here, then, Bhag must have been rendered momentarily unconscious. Michael
  guessed the lure of drugged wine, that butyl chloride which was part of the
  murderer's equipment. But for once Longvale had misjudged the strength of his
  prey. Bhag must have followed the brown folk to Dower House&mdash;the man and
  woman whom the old man in his cunning had spared.</p>

  <p>Michael was soon to discover what was going to happen. The old man opened
  the door of the buffet and took out a great steel hook, at the end of which
  was a pulley. Reaching up, he slipped the end of the hook into a steel bolt
  fastened in one of the overhead beams. Michael had noticed it before and
  wondered what purpose it served. He was now to learn.</p>

  <p>From the cupboard came a long coil of rope, one end of which was threaded
  through the pulley and fastened dexterously under the detective's armpits.
  Stooping, Longvale lifted the carpet and rolled it up, and then Michael saw
  that there was a small trap-door, which he raised and laid back. Below he
  could see nothing, but there came to him the sound of a man's groaning.</p>

  <p>"Now I think we can dispense with that, sir," said Mr. Longvale, and
  untied the serviette that covered the detective's mouth.</p>

  <p>This done, he pulled on the rope, seemingly without an effort, and Michael
  swung in mid-air. It was uncomfortable; he had an absurd notion that he
  looked a little ridiculous. The old man guided his feet through the opening
  and gradually paid out the rope.</p>

  <p>"Will you be good enough to tell me when you touch ground," he asked, "and
  I will come down to you?"</p>

  <p>Looking up, Michael saw the square in the floor grow smaller and smaller,
  and for an unconscionable time he swung and swayed and turned in mid-air. He
  thought he was not moving, and then, without warning, his feet touched ground
  and he called out.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right?" said Mr. Longvale pleasantly. "Do you mind stepping a
  few paces to one side? I am dropping the rope, and it may hurt you."</p>

  <p>Michael gasped, but carried out instructions, and presently he heard the
  swish of the falling line and the smack of it as it struck the ground. Then
  the trap-door closed, and there was no other sound but the groaning near at
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Penne?"</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" asked the other in a frightened voice. "Is it you, Brixan?
  Where are we? What has happened? How did I get here? That old devil gave me a
  drink. I ran out&mdash;and that's all I remember. I went to borrow his car.
  My God, I'm scared! The magneto of mine went wrong."</p>

  <p>"Did you shout when you ran from the house?"</p>

  <p>"I think I did. I felt this infernal poison taking effect and dashed
  out&mdash;I don't remember. Where are you, Brixan? The police will get us out
  of this, won't they?"</p>

  <p>"Alive, I hope," said Michael grimly, and he heard the man's frightened
  sob, and was sorry he had spoken.</p>

  <p>"What is he? Who is he? Are these the caves? I've heard about them. It
  smells horribly earthy, doesn't it? Can you see anything?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I saw a light just then," said Michael, "but my eyes are
  playing tricks." And then: "Where is Adele Leamington?"</p>

  <p>"God knows!" said the other. He was shivering, and Michael heard the sound
  of his chattering teeth. "I never saw her again. I was afraid Bhag would go
  after her. But he wouldn't hurt her&mdash;he is a queer devil. I wish he was
  here now."</p>

  <p>"I wish somebody was here," said Michael sincerely. He was trying to work
  his wrists loose of the hand cuffs, though he knew that bare-handed he stood
  very little chance against the old man. He had lost his pistol, and although,
  in the inside of his waistcoat, there remained intact the long, razor-sharp
  knife that had cleared him out of many a Continental scrape, the one
  infallible weapon when firearms failed, he knew that he would have no
  opportunity for its employment.</p>

  <p>Sitting down, he tried to perform a trick that he had seen on a stage in
  Berlin&mdash;the trick of bringing his legs through his manacled hands and so
  getting his hands in front of him, but he struggled without avail. There came
  the sound of a door opening, and Mr. Longvale's voice.</p>

  <p>"I won't keep you a moment," he said. He carried a lantern in his hand
  that swung as he walked and seemed to intensify the gloom. "I don't like my
  patients to catch cold."</p>

  <p>His laughter came echoing back from the vaulted roof of the cave,
  intensified hideously. Stopping, he struck a match and a brilliant light
  appeared. It was a vapour lamp fixed on a shelf of rock. Presently he lit
  another, and then a third and a fourth, and, in the white, unwinking light,
  every object in the cave stood out with startling distinctness. Michael saw
  the scarlet thing that stood in the cave's centre, and, hardened as he was,
  and prepared for that fearsome sight, he shuddered.</p>

  <p>It was a guillotine!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap40"
     id="chap40">XL. "THE WIDOW"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A GUILLOTINE!</p>

  <p>Standing in the middle of the cave, its high frame work lifted starkly. It
  was painted blood-red, and its very simplicity had a horror of its own.</p>

  <p>Michael looked, fascinated. The basket, the bright, triangular knife
  suspended at the top of the frame, the tilted platform with its dangling
  straps, the black-painted lunette, shaped to receive the head of the victim
  and hold it in position till the knife fell in its oiled groove. He knew the
  machine bolt by bolt, had seen it in operation on grey mornings before French
  prisons, with soldiers holding back the crowd and a little group of officials
  in the centre of the cleared space. He knew the sound of it, the "clop!" as
  it fell, sweeping to eternity the man beneath.</p>

  <p>"The Widow'!" said Longvale humorously. He touched the frame lovingly.</p>

  <p>"Oh God! I'm not fit to die!" It was Penne's agonized wail that went
  echoing through the hollow spaces of the cavern.</p>

  <p>"'The Widow'," murmured the old man again.</p>

  <p>He was without a hat; his bald head shone in the light, yet there was
  nothing ludicrous in his appearance. His attitude toward this thing he loved
  was in a sense pathetic.</p>

  <p>"Who shall be her first bridegroom?"</p>

  <p>"Not me, not me!" squealed Penne, wriggling back against the wall, his
  face ashen, his mouth working convulsively. "I'm not fit to die&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Longvale walked slowly over to him, stooped and raised him to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Courage!" he murmured. "It is the hour!"</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth was pacing the road when the police car came flying back
  from Chichester.</p>

  <p>"He's not there, hasn't been to the station at all," said the driver
  breathlessly as he flung out of the car.</p>

  <p>"He may have gone into Longvale's house."</p>

  <p>"I've seen Mr. Longvale: it was he who told me that the Captain had gone
  into Chichester. He must have made a mistake."</p>

  <p>Knebworth's jaw dropped. A great light suddenly flashed upon his mind.
  Longvale! There was something queer about him. Was it possible &mdash;?</p>

  <p>He remembered now that he had been puzzled by a contradictory statement
  the old man had made; remembered that, not once but many times, Sampson
  Longvale had expressed a desire to be filmed in a favourite part of his own,
  one that he had presented, an episode in the life of his famous ancestor.</p>

  <p>"We'll go and knock him up. I'll talk to him." They hammered at the door
  without eliciting a response.</p>

  <p>"That's his bedroom." Jack Knebworth pointed to a latticed window where a
  light shone, and Inspector Lyle threw up a pebble with such violence that the
  glass was broken. Still there was no response.</p>

  <p>"I don't like that," said Knebworth suddenly.</p>

  <p>"You don't like it any better than I do," growled the officer. "Try that
  window, Smith."</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to open it, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, without delay."</p>

  <p>A second later, the window of the long dining-room was prized open; and
  then they came upon an obstacle which could not be so readily forced.</p>

  <p>"The shutter is steel-lined," reported the detective. "I think I'd better
  try one of the upper rooms. Give me a leg up, somebody."</p>

  <p>With the assistance of a fellow, he reached up and caught the sill of an
  open window, the very window from which Adele had looked down into the
  grinning face of Bhag. In another second he was in the room and was reaching
  down to help up a second officer. A few minutes' delay, and the front door
  was unbarred and opened.</p>

  <p>"There's nobody in the house, so far as I can find out," said the
  officer.</p>

  <p>"Put a light on," ordered the inspector shortly.</p>

  <p>They found the little vapour lamp and lit it.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" The detective officer pointed to the hook that still hung
  in the beam with the pulley beneath, and his eyes narrowed. "I can't
  understand that," he said slowly. "What was that for?"</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth uttered an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Here's Brixan's gun!" he said, and picked it up from the floor.</p>

  <p>One glance the inspector gave, and then his eyes went back to the hook and
  the pulley.</p>

  <p>"That beats me," he said. "See if you fellows can find anything anywhere.
  Open every cupboard, every drawer. Sound the walls&mdash;there may be secret
  doors; there are in all these old Tudor houses."</p>

  <p>The search was futile, and Inspector Lyle came back to a worried
  contemplation of the hook and pulley. Then one of his men came in to say that
  he had located the garage.</p>

  <p>It was an unusually long building, and when it was opened it revealed no
  more than the old-fashioned car which was a familiar object in that part of
  the country. But obviously this was only half the accommodation. The
  seemingly solid whitewashed wall behind the machine hid another apartment,
  though it had no door, and an inspection of the outside showed a solid wall
  at the far end of the garage.</p>

  <p>Jack Knebworth tapped the interior wall.</p>

  <p>"This isn't brickwork at all, it's wood," he said.</p>

  <p>Hanging in a corner was a chain. Apparently it had no particular function,
  but a careful scrutiny led to the discovery that the links ran through a hole
  in the roughly plastered ceiling. The inspector caught the chain and pulled,
  and as he did so the "wall" opened inwards, showing the contents of the
  second chamber, which was a second car, so sheeted that only its radiator was
  visible. Knebworth pulled off the cover, and:</p>

  <p>"That's the car."</p>

  <p>"What car?" asked the inspector.</p>

  <p>"The car driven by the Head-Hunter," said Knebworth quickly. "He was in
  that machine when Brixan tried to arrest him. I'd know it anywhere! Brixan is
  in the Dower House somewhere, and if he's in the hands of the Head-Hunter,
  God help him!"</p>

  <p>They ran back to the house, and again the hook and pulley drew them as a
  magnet. Suddenly the police officer bent down and jerked back the carpet. The
  trap-door beneath the pulley was plainly visible. Pulling it open, he knelt
  down and gazed through. Knebworth saw his face grow haggard.</p>

  <p>"Too late, too late!" he muttered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap41"
     id="chap41">XLI. THE DEATH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE shriek of a man half crazy with fear is not nice to
  hear. Michael's nerves were tough, but he had need to drive the nails into
  the palms of his manacled hands to keep his self-control.</p>

  <p>"I warn you," he found voice to say, as the shrieking died to an
  unintelligible babble of sound, "Longvale, if you do this, you are
  everlastingly damned!"</p>

  <p>The old man turned his quiet smile upon his second prisoner, but did not
  make any answer. Lifting the half-conscious man in his arms as easily as
  though he were a child, he carried him to the terrible machine, and laid him,
  face downwards, on the tilted platform. There was no hurry. Michael saw, in
  Longvale's leisure, an enjoyment that was unbelievable. He stepped to the
  front of the machine and pulled up one half of the lunette; there was a
  click, and it remained stationary.</p>

  <p>"An invention of mine," he said with pride, speaking over his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>Michael looked away for a second, past the grim executioner, to the
  farther end of the cave. And then he saw a sight that brought the blood to
  his cheeks. At first he thought he was dreaming, and that the strain of his
  ordeal was responsible for some grotesque vision.</p>

  <p>Adele!</p>

  <p>She stood clear in the white light, so grimed with earth and dust that she
  seemed to be wearing a grey robe.</p>

  <p>"If you move I will kill you."</p>

  <p>It was she! He twisted over on to his knees and staggered upright.
  Longvale heard the voice and turned slowly.</p>

  <p>"My little lady," he said pleasantly. "How providential! I've always
  thought that the culminating point in my career would be, as was the sainted
  Charles Henry's, that moment when a queen came under his hand. How very
  singular!"</p>

  <p>He walked slowly toward her, oblivious of the pointed pistol, to the
  danger in which he stood, a radiant smile on his face, his small white hands
  extended as to an honoured guest.</p>

  <p>"Shoot!" cried Michael hoarsely. "For God's sake, shoot!"</p>

  <p>She hesitated for a second and pressed the trigger. There was no
  sound&mdash;clogged with earth, the delicate mechanism did not act.</p>

  <p>She turned to flee, but his arm was round her, and his disengaged hand
  threw her head to his breast.</p>

  <p>"You shall see, my dear," he said. "The Widow shall become the Widower,
  and you shall be his first bride!"</p>

  <p>She was limp in his arms now, incapable of resistance. A strange sense of
  inertia overcame her; and, though she was conscious, she could neither of her
  own volition move nor speak. Michael, struggling madly to release his hands,
  prayed that she might faint&mdash;that, whatever happened, she should be
  spared a consciousness of the terror.</p>

  <p>"Now, who shall be first?" murmured the old man, stroking his shiny head.
  "It would be fitting that my lady should show the way and be spared the agony
  of mind. And yet&mdash;" He looked thoughtfully at the prostrate figure
  strapped to the board, and, tilting the platform, dropped the lunette about
  the head of Gregory Penne. The hand went up to the lever that controlled the
  knife. He paused again, evidently puzzling something out in his crazy
  mind.</p>

  <p>"No, you shall be first," he said, unbuckled the strap and pushed the
  half-demented man to the ground.</p>

  <p>Michael saw him lift his head, listening. There were hollow sounds above,
  as of people walking. Again he changed his mind, stooped and dragged Gregory
  Penne to his feet. Michael wondered why he held him so long, standing so
  rigidly; wondered why he dropped him suddenly to the ground; and then
  wondered no longer. Something was crossing the floor of the cave&mdash;a
  great, hairy something, whose malignant eyes were turned upon the old
  man.</p>

  <p>It was Bhag! His hair was matted with blood; his face wore the powder mask
  which Michael had seen when he emerged from Griff Towers. He stopped and
  sniffed at the groaning man on the floor, and his big paw touched the face
  tenderly. Then, without preliminary, he leapt at Longvale, and the old man
  went down with a crash to the ground, his arms whirling in futile defence.
  For a second Bhag stood over him, looking down, twittering and chattering;
  and then he raised the man and laid him in the place where his master had
  been, tilting the board and pushing it forward.</p>

  <p>Michael gazed with fascinated horror. The great ape had witnessed an
  execution! It was from this cave that he had escaped the night that Foss was
  killed! His half-human mind was remembering the details. Michael could almost
  see his mind working to recall the procedure.</p>

  <p>Bhag fumbled with the frame, touched the spring that released the lunette,
  and it fell over the neck of the Head-Hunter. And at that moment, attracted
  by a sound, Michael looked up, saw the trap above pulled back. Bhag heard it
  also, but was too intent upon his business to be interrupted. Longvale had
  recovered consciousness and was fighting to draw his head from the lunette.
  Presently he spoke. It was as though he realized the imminence of his fate
  and was struggling to find an appropriate phrase, for he lay quiescent now,
  his hands gripping the edge of the narrow platform on which he lay.</p>

  <p>"Son of St. Louis, ascend to heaven!" he said, and at that moment Bhag
  jerked the handle that controlled the knife.</p>

  <p>Inspector Lyle from above saw the blade fall, heard the indescribable
  sound of the thud that followed, and almost swooned. Then, from below:</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Inspector. You may find a rope in the buffet. Get down as
  quickly as you can and bring a gun."</p>

  <p>The buffet cupboard contained another rope, and a minute later the
  detective was going down hand over hand.</p>

  <p>"There's no danger from the monkey," said Michael. Bhag was crooning over
  his senseless master as a mother over her child.</p>

  <p>"Get Miss Leamington away," said Michael in a low voice, as the detective
  began to unlock the handcuffs.</p>

  <p>The girl lay, an inanimate and silent figure, by the side of the
  guillotine, happily oblivious of the tragedy which had been enacted in her
  presence. Another detective had descended the rope, and old Jack Knebworth,
  despite his years, was the third to enter the cave. It was he who found the
  door and aided the detective to carry the girl to safety.</p>

  <p>Unlocking the handcuffs from the baronet's wrists, Michael tuned him over
  on his back. One glance at the face told the detective that the man was in a
  fit, and that his case, if not hopeless, was at least desperate. As though
  understanding that the man had no ill intent toward his master, Bhag watched
  passively, and then Michael remembered how, the first time he had seen the
  great ape, Bhag had smelt his hands.</p>

  <p>"He's filing you for future reference as a friend," Gregory had said at
  the time.</p>

  <p>"Pick him up," said Michael, speaking distinctly in the manner that
  Gregory had addressed the ape.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Bhag stooped and lifted the limp man in his arms, and
  Michael guided him to the stairway and led him up the stairs.</p>

  <p>The house was full of police, who gaped at the sight of the great ape and
  his burden.</p>

  <p>"Take him upstairs and put him on the bed," ordered Michael.</p>

  <p>Knebworth had already taken the girl off in his car to Chichester, for she
  had shown signs of reviving and he wanted to get her away from that house of
  the dead before she fully recovered.</p>

  <p>Michael went down into the cave again and joined the inspector. Together
  they made a brief tour. The headless figures in the niches told their own
  story. Farther on, Michael came to the bigger cavern, with its floor littered
  with bones.</p>

  <p>"Here is confirmation of the old legend," he said in a hushed voice, and
  pointed. "These are the bones of those warriors and squires who were trapped
  in the cave by a landslide. You can see the horses' skeletons quite
  plainly."</p>

  <p>How had Adele got into the cave? He was not long before he found the slide
  down which she had stumbled.</p>

  <p>"Another mystery is explained," he said. "Griff Tower was obviously built
  by the Romans to prevent cattle and men from falling through into the cave.
  Incidentally, it has served as an excellent ventilator, and I have no doubt
  the old man had this way prepared, both as a hiding-place for the people he
  had killed and as a way of escape."</p>

  <p>He saw the candle-lantern and matches that the girl had missed, and this
  he regarded as conclusive proof that his view was right.</p>

  <p>They came back to the guillotine with its ghastly burden, and Michael
  stood in silence for a long time, looking at the still figure stretched on
  the platform, its hands still clutching the sides.</p>

  <p>"How did he persuade these people to come to their death?" asked the
  inspector in a voice a little above a whisper.</p>

  <p>"That is a question for the psychologist," said Michael at last. "There is
  no doubt that he got into touch with many men who were contemplating suicide
  but shrank from the act, and performed this service for them. I should
  imagine his practice of leaving around their heads for identification arose
  out of some poor wretch's desire that his wife and family should secure his
  insurance.</p>

  <p>"He worked with extraordinary cunning. The letters, as you know, went to a
  house of call and were collected by an old woman, who posted them to a second
  address, whence they were put in prepared envelopes and posted, ostensibly to
  London. I discovered that the envelopes were kept in a specially light-proof
  box, and that the unknown advertiser had stipulated that they should not be
  taken out of that box until they were ready for posting. An hour after those
  letters were put in the mail the address faded and became invisible, and
  another appeared."</p>

  <p>"Vanishing-ink?"</p>

  <p>Mike nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is a trick that criminals frequently employ. The new address, of
  course, was Dower House. Put out the lights and let us go up."</p>

  <p>Three lamps were extinguished, and the detective looked round fearfully at
  the shadows.</p>

  <p>"I think we'll leave this down here," he said.</p>

  <p>"I think we will," said Michael, in complete agreement.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap42"
     id="chap42">XLII. CAMERA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THREE months had passed since the Dower House had yielded up
  its grisly secrets. A long enough time for Gregory Penne to recover
  completely and to have served one of the six months' imprisonment to which he
  was sentenced on a technical charge. The guillotine had been re-erected in a
  certain Black Museum on the Thames Embankment, where young policemen come to
  look upon the equipment of criminality. People had ceased to talk about the
  Head-Hunter.</p>

  <p>It seemed a million years ago to Michael as he sat, perched on a table,
  watching Jack Knebworth, in the last stages of despair, directing a ruffled
  Reggie Connolly in the business of love-making. Nearby stood Adele
  Leamington, a star by virtue of the success that had attended a certain trade
  show.</p>

  <p>Out of range of the camera, a cigarette between her fingers, Stella
  Mendoza, gorgeously attired, watched her sometime friend and prospective
  leading-man with good-natured contempt.</p>

  <p>"There's nobody can tell me, Mr. Knebworth," said Reggie testily, "how to
  hold a girl! Good gracious, heavens alive, have I been asleep all my life?
  Don't you think I know as much about girls as you, Mr. Knebworth?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care a darn how you hold your girl!" howled Jack. "I'm telling
  you how to hold my girl! There's only one way of making love, and that's my
  way. I've got the patent rights! Your arm round her waist again, Connolly.
  Hold your head up, will you? Now turn it this way. Now drop your chin a
  little. Smile, darn you, smile! Not a prop smile!" he shrieked. "Smile as if
  you liked her. Try to imagine that she loves you! I'll apologize to you
  afterwards, Adele, but try to imagine it, Connolly. That's better. You look
  as if you'd swallowed a liqueur of broken glass! Look down into her
  eyes&mdash;look, I said, not glare! That's better. Now do that
  again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He watched, writhing, gesticulating, and at last, in cold resignation:
  "Rotten, but it'll have to do. Lights!"</p>

  <p>The big Kreisler lights flared, the banked mercury lamps burnt bluely, and
  the flood-lamps became blank expanses of diffused light. Again the rehearsal
  went through, and then: "Camera!" wailed Jack, and the handle began to
  turn.</p>

  <p>"That's all for you today, Connolly," said Jack. "Now, Miss
  Mendoza&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Adele came across to where Michael was sitting and jumped up on to the
  table beside him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Knebworth is quite right," she said, shaking her head. "Reggie
  Connolly doesn't know how to make love."</p>

  <p>"Who does?" demanded Michael. "Except the right man?"</p>

  <p>"He's supposed to be the right man," she insisted. "And, what's more, he's
  supposed to be the best lover on the English screen."</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha!" said Michael sardonically.</p>

  <p>She was silent for a time, and then:</p>

  <p>"Why are you still here? I thought your work was finished in this part of
  the world."</p>

  <p>"Not all," he said cheerfully. "I've still an arrest to make."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him quickly.</p>

  <p>"Another?" she said. "I thought, when you took poor Sir
  Gregory&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Poor Sir Gregory!" he scoffed. "He ought to be a very happy man. Six
  months' hard labour was just what he wanted, and he was lucky to be charged,
  not with the killing of his unfortunate servant, but with the concealment of
  his death."</p>

  <p>"Whom are you arresting now?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure," said Michael, "whether I shall arrest her."</p>

  <p>"Is it a woman?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"What has she done?"</p>

  <p>"The charge isn't definitely settled," he said evasively, "but I think
  there will be several counts. Creating a disturbance will be one;
  deliberately endangering public health&mdash;at any rate, the health of one
  of the public&mdash;will be another; maliciously wounding the
  feelings&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you, you mean."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"I thought that was part of your delirium that night at the hospital, or
  part of mine. But as other people saw you kiss me, it must have been yours. I
  don't think I want to marry," she said thoughtfully. "I am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't say that you are wedded to your art," he groaned. "They all say
  that!"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not wedded to anything, except a desire to prevent my best friend
  from making a great mistake. You've a very big career in front of you,
  Michael, and marrying me is not going to help you. People will think you're
  just infatuated, and when the inevitable divorce comes along&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They both laughed together.</p>

  <p>"If you have finished being like a maiden aunt, I want to tell you
  something," said Michael, "I've loved you from the moment I first saw
  you."</p>

  <p>"Of course you have," she said calmly. "That's the only possible way you
  can love a girl. If it takes three days to make up your mind it can't be
  love. That's why I know I don't love you. I was annoyed with you the first
  time I met you; I was furious with you the second time; and I've just
  tolerated you ever since. Wait till I get my make-up off."</p>

  <p>She got down and ran to her dressing-room. Michael strolled across to
  comfort an exhausted Jack Knebworth.</p>

  <p>"Adele? Oh, she's all right. She really has had an offer from
  America&mdash;not Hollywood, but a studio in the East. I've advised her not
  to take it until she's a little more proficient, but I don't think she wanted
  any advice. That girl isn't going to stay in the picture business."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that, Knebworth?"</p>

  <p>"She's going to get married," said Jack glumly, "I can recognize the
  signs. I told you all along that there was something queer about her. She's
  going to get married and leave the screen for good&mdash;that's her
  eccentricity."</p>

  <p>"And whom do you think she will marry?" asked Michael.</p>

  <p>Old Jack snorted.</p>

  <p>"It won't be Reggie Connolly&mdash;that I can promise you."</p>

  <p>"I should jolly well say not!" said that indignant young man, who had
  remarkably keen ears. "I'm not a marrying chap. It spoils an artist. A wife
  is like a millstone round his neck. He has no chance of expressing his
  individuality. And whilst we are on the subject, Mr. Knebworth, are you
  perfectly sure that I'm to blame? Doesn't it strike you&mdash;mind you, I
  wouldn't say a word against the dear girl&mdash;doesn't it strike you that
  Miss Leamington isn't quite&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;seasoned in
  love&mdash;that's the expression?"</p>

  <p>Stella Mendoza had strolled up. She had returned to the scene of her
  former labours, and it looked very much as if she were coming back to her
  former position.</p>

  <p>"When you say 'seasoned' you mean 'smoked', Reggie," she said. "I think
  you're wrong."</p>

  <p>"I can't be wrong," said Reggie complacently. "I've made love to more
  girls in this country than any other five leading-men, and I tell you that
  Miss Leamington is distinctly and fearfully immature."</p>

  <p>The object of their discussion appeared at the end of the studio, nodded a
  cheery good night to the company and went out, Michael on her heels.</p>

  <p>"You're fearfully immature," he said, as he guided her across the
  road.</p>

  <p>"Who said so? It sounds like Reggie: that is a favourite word of his."</p>

  <p>"He says you know nothing whatever about love making."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I don't," she said shortly, and so baffling was her tone that he
  was not prepared to continue the subject until they reached the long, dark
  road in which she lived.</p>

  <p>"The proper way to make love," he said, more than a little appalled at his
  own boldness, "is to put one hand on the waist&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly she was in his arms, her cool face against his.</p>

  <p>"There isn't any way," she murmured. "One just does!"</p>
