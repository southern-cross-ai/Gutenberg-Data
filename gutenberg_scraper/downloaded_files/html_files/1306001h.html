  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE MEN OF THE MOOR</h2>

  <p class="first">A GALE of wind and rain swept across the barren face of
  Dartmoor, that ancient desolation. The howl and shriek of it came to Betty
  Carew above the rattle and roar of the motor engine as the old car grunted
  and groaned up the steep hill.</p>

  <p>The lights of Tavistock had long since disappeared. Princetown was three
  miles beyond the crest of the hill. About them was an infinite loneliness,
  and the sobbing of wind that drove the needle-sharp sleet into their faces.
  The yellow-faced old man who drove did not speak&mdash;he had not spoken
  since they left Tavistock; would not willingly break his silence before they
  reached Exeter&mdash;or after.</p>

  <p>The car laboured up the twisting road, skidding and sliding from left to
  right, and with every lurch the girl's heart came into her mouth.</p>

  <p>At the top of the hill the full force of the gale caught them and all but
  brought the car to a stand-still. Rain smacked viciously against the screen,
  whipped under the lowered brim of her hat, thrashing her face till it smarted
  intolerably.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think we'd be wise if we went back to Tavistock?"</p>

  <p>She had to raise her voice to a scream before he heard her.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>The answer came like a pistol shot, and she said no more. Dr. Laffin had
  bought the car cheap at a sale of Army derelicts&mdash;it had been old before
  the requisitions of war had called it for military service. It served him
  well enough; gave him the illusion of economy at a moment when economy was
  necessary. He had a small starveling property on the edge of the moor, a farm
  where a ploughshare touched rock every rood or so. His tenant was a man who
  complained regularly and paid his rent occasionally. The further illusion of
  proprietorship almost compensated Dr. Laffin for other deficiencies.</p>

  <p>West of Princetown the wind slackened and normal speech was possible.</p>

  <p>"You won't try to get beyond Exeter to-night?" asked the girl nervously.
  It was not beyond the bounds of possibility that he would continue the
  journey to London.</p>

  <p>"I don't know." His tone was uncompromising.</p>

  <p>Betty could have said something unpleasant, but wisely held her tongue.
  They skirted the prison fields; the lights of the car showed momentarily the
  ugly arch before the jail, and a muffled figure leaning upon a rifle beyond
  the gate; and in another minute they had passed through Princetown and were
  facing the winds of the open moor.</p>

  <p>In spite of her oilskin coat, the girl was soaked through; she was cold
  and stiff and hungry, and for the first time in her life thought longingly of
  the grim house in Camden Road. Then, to her surprise, the man spoke.</p>

  <p>"This is better than play-acting... living reality... there are spirits in
  this place I can feel them. Hail thou!"</p>

  <p>His hand came off the driving wheel and was raised in stiff salute. Betty,
  shivering with terror, shut her eyes tight.</p>

  <p>Play-acting! If that wretched road engagement hadn't come to an abrupt
  end&mdash;at Tavistock of all places in the world, and, by a hideous
  coincidence, at the very moment Joshua Laffin was making a half-yearly visit
  to his "property"!</p>

  <p>"There are evil things chained to the dark!" His voice prim, emotionless,
  pierced the whine and flurry of gale and engine. "Terrors undreamt of by
  shallow minds... what of the forty million spirits of Atlantis?"</p>

  <p>She put her hands to her ears, and the next moment could have shrieked her
  fears. Ahead of them gleamed a red spot of light in the very centre of the
  road. It was like a fiery eye glowering from some cyclopean socket.</p>

  <p>The car jangled and shuddered to a standstill before she saw the figure
  with the red lantern.</p>

  <p>The lights of the car were poor, aged oil-burning lamps, and the man who
  had swung the lantern showed dimly. He seemed to be dressed in a long,
  close-fitting gown like the habit of a monk.... Her mouth opened wide in
  wonder and fear&mdash;the head was shrouded in a cowl that covered the
  face&mdash;and she saw only a gleam of eyes behind narrow slits cut in the
  cloth.</p>

  <p>"May I speak to you, please?" said the cowled man, and now she saw that he
  had a companion, a sombre companion similarly attired.</p>

  <p>"What is it? What is the meaning of this foolery?" grated Joshua
  Laffin.</p>

  <p>The man walked to his side and said something in a tone so low that Betty
  could not hear a word.</p>

  <p>"Huh... well, I am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Laffin's voice sank to a rumble, and for a minute or two they carried on a
  conversation in an undertone. Presently:</p>

  <p>"I'll draw the car up by the side of the road," said Dr. Laffin, and,
  twisting his head toward the girl: "You'll wait here."</p>

  <p>"Here!" she said, aghast. "In the middle of Dartmoor... alone!"</p>

  <p>"This gentleman will look after you&mdash;there is no occasion for panic.
  I would not leave you if there were."</p>

  <p>He indicated the shadowy form of the second "monk" standing just outside
  the spread of the lamp's rays.</p>

  <p>Betty made no answer, but watched Laffin and his sinister companion till
  they disappeared in the darkness.</p>

  <p>The second man did not stir. Vainly she tried to keep her eyes away from
  the cowled face.</p>

  <p>Laffin had been gone a quarter of an hour, when there came a sound that
  added to the fearfulness of the night. The deep boom of a bell... She tried
  to locate it and failed.</p>

  <p><i>Dong!</i></p>

  <p>Again, and then...</p>

  <p>The faint sound of voices&mdash;deep-chested voices of men chanting.</p>

  <p><i>Dong!</i></p>

  <p>She was trembling in every limb. What did all this portend? She looked
  round nervously. The man still stood where he had been, watching&mdash;what?
  She had a feeling that he was listening too, his ears strained&mdash;for
  what?</p>

  <p>An hour passed before she heard feet on the hard road and somebody saying
  "Good-night." It was the doctor and he was returning alone: he must have left
  his guide somewhere in the darkness. When she looked, the second man had
  disappeared as if he had vanished into the earth.</p>

  <p>Laffin cranked up his car and climbed in.</p>

  <p>"Who were they?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He did not reply, and the car jerked on its way. She had added one more to
  the many questions he never answered.</p>

  <p>Fifteen months later he offered a solution to the riddle of the moor: but
  this she did not know.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; DR. LAFFIN COMMANDS</h2>

  <p class="first">BETTY CAREW listened, aghast. In that gloomy, dusty room,
  ill-lit, badly ventilated, redolent of musty paper and ancient leather
  bindings, she had heard many fantastic views and commands expressed by Dr.
  Joshua Laffin, but never one so bizarre as this.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand." She was speaking no more than the truth. "Why
  do you wish me to do this?"</p>

  <p>He took a pinch of snuff from a tortoiseshell box, replaced the box on the
  table and leant back in his high-backed chair, his dark eyes fixed on hers.
  He wore his customary black, and in the candle-light and against the dark
  background he was just a long, yellow face and a pair of lined, thin hands
  that moved restlessly.</p>

  <p>"I give you neither 'why' nor 'wherefore'," he said, in a queer voice that
  had something of the softer notes of an owl in it; the whoo-ing of a man who
  habitually spoke through lips that were pursed as if to whistle. "I command.
  You know me, Elizabeth. I will have my way. Especially now. One has had
  disappointments; certain plans have miscarried. In this last matter there
  must be no hitch. As you know, I am but the servant of others&mdash;not of
  this plane."</p>

  <p>He waved his hand to the shadowy corners of the room, and the girl
  experienced all the old terror that this gloomy house had inspired in her
  during the fourteen years she had been an inmate.</p>

  <p>"Here is Kama, the tamed Nemesis, vitalised by my genius. Here the great
  Manasuputra, divine force of beneficence," he said. "You, who might have
  become acquainted with these mysteries, preferred the transient pleasure of
  sense."</p>

  <p>An old story and an old reproach that left her unperturbed.</p>

  <p>"My immeasurable superiority to the world," he went on, "and, therefore,
  to its opinions, should have helped you to overcome any stupid qualms. You
  are vain, you are conceited, just as all girls with a title to prettiness are
  vain and conceited. Your ego is distorted. Contact with me, which would have
  humbled most people, has merely puffed you up with pride. I am not even
  flattered. I would wish that my greatness abashed you. But no! Charity child,
  workhouse child, though no decent man or woman could know the truth about you
  without shrinking in horror, you persist in opposing your wishes, your 'whys'
  to my instructions. Gutter brat, gallows child, scum of the very dregs, I
  cannot teach you humility!"</p>

  <p>He did not raise his voice in anger; the epithets fell in his cold,
  finicking tones, like the tappings of cold rain upon glass.</p>

  <p>She was neither distressed nor amused. The candlelight played upon the
  mouldings of a spiritual face, singularly lovely. Another mystery than that
  he spoke about was in the shadowed eyes, mystery in the dusky shadings of her
  throat. Only the glory of her hair persisted, as superior to the meagre
  illumination as Dr. Laffin was to the world.</p>

  <p>Dr. Laffin saw nothing of beauty in her through his hard, brown eyes, that
  glared without winking, vulture-like in their dispassionate intensity.</p>

  <p>"I may be all these things," said Betty calmly, "and yet feel a natural
  diffidence at sitting in a shop window for people to gape at me. I see no
  sense in it. I don't profess to be a great actress&mdash;I know I'm
  not&mdash;but I love my profession too much to let it down in the way you
  suggest. What am I supposed to advertise?"</p>

  <p>A gesture answered her.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't matter, I suppose? Well, I'll not do it."</p>

  <p>She got up slowly from the side of the worn writing-table, resolution in
  the poise of her head, the set of her fine mouth.</p>

  <p>"Good night," said Laffin, not rising. "You will find your way out. I am
  going to take my ten. Close the door carefully."</p>

  <p>She never expected him to say any more than this. For a second she looked
  down at him, her lips curled, a bitter loathing in her heart for the man who
  had tortured her childhood with fear, and had blasted her future to humour
  his whim. His head was drooping&mdash;the "ten" had overtaken him&mdash;that
  ten minutes of sleep so profound that nothing had ever awakened him. How
  helpless he was now! For one wild, mad moment she stood over him, her hands
  clenched, trembling in her impotent anger, and then, wrenching herself free
  from the hate that gripped her, she ran out of the room, down the uncarpeted
  stairs and into the street. The door boomed behind her.</p>

  <p>"I hope he heard it in his dreams," she said.</p>

  <p>The tall man who had been waiting for her at the garden gate laughed
  softly.</p>

  <p>"That sounds vicious," he said.</p>

  <p>"You like him, Clive?"</p>

  <p>Clive Lowbridge chuckled as he helped her into the little coupé that had
  been waiting outside during the interview.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;in a way. His pomposity doesn't annoy me, because he is
  sincere. He really does think he is the greatest man in the world. And in
  many ways he has been helpful to me."</p>

  <p>"How did you come to know him?"</p>

  <p>Clive did not answer until he had brought the car on to the main road and
  had dodged a fast-moving tramcar.</p>

  <p>"That fellow is exceeding all road-car limits," he growled savagely. "What
  were you saying? I've known him all my life. He was the family physician. The
  home of our illustrious family used to be in Bath, and the Laffins have been
  our doctors for hundreds of years. It is a sort of tradition. He was my
  tutor&mdash;did you know that? Laffin's clever. Most of these weird birds
  are. You're glad to be away from that <i>ménage</i>, aren't you, Betty?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>In her attitude there was no encouragement to continue his
  questioning.</p>

  <p>"He's a queer devil. My uncle used to swear by him, and so did my
  great-uncle, the seventh baron"</p>

  <p>She interrupted him, obviously anxious to turn the subject.</p>

  <p>"How do your new honours sit upon you, Clive&mdash;heavily?"</p>

  <p>The ninth Lord Lowbridge was mildly amused.</p>

  <p>"The honours are a featherweight, but the mortgages&mdash;phew! How Uncle
  Ferrers got rid of his money, heaven knows! At least, heaven and the
  accountants! We always thought he was immensely wealthy. I fear it is art or
  nothing with me, but I shall be obliged to paint one masterpiece a year to
  pay the interest on the mortgages." She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Your celebration party was premature."</p>

  <p>He grinned again as he sent the car whizzing through the gates of Regent's
  Park, narrowly avoiding a sedate limousine "La Florette," he said tersely, as
  he glimpsed the woman in its blazing interior. "That woman just hates being
  unnoticed! Why she doesn't have her name in lights on the top of the car is a
  standing wonder to me. You know her, of course?"</p>

  <p>Betty Carew made a little face in the dark. She knew La Florette very
  well, only too well!</p>

  <p>"Poor Clive!" she said. "A lord without money is a pathetic creature! Not
  so pathetic, perhaps, as an ambitious actress who is doomed to be a
  showgirl&mdash;at least, that is what I'm going to be if Robespierre has his
  way."</p>

  <p>"Robespierre&mdash;oh, you mean the doctor? He <i>does</i> look like the
  sea-green incorruptible now that you mention the fact. What does he want you
  to do?"</p>

  <p>Betty fetched a long sigh. She had returned of her own volition to a
  subject that was hateful to discuss, and yet impossible to dismiss from her
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>"He has one of his mad schemes&mdash;I am to accept an engagement from a
  man who wishes to advertise a desk. He mentioned a desk early in the
  conversation, so I suppose that is what it is."</p>

  <p>"But how?"</p>

  <p>"I am to sit in a store window for four hours a day&mdash;the window is to
  be built furnished like a study&mdash;wearing a green dress, and writing, or
  pretending to write, at the desk, on which"&mdash;she laughed in spite of her
  anger&mdash;"will be a jade vase with one red rose. Can you imagine it?"
  Clive Lowbridge did not answer for a long time.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he's mad?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure&mdash;there is no question about it&mdash;and oh! there is
  another thing! A man will one day come to me and ask me for 'the message' and
  I am to give him a letter which will be kept in the top right-hand drawer of
  the desk."</p>

  <p>"He <i>is</i> mad," said Lowbridge emphatically, "and of course you'll do
  nothing of the kind, Betty."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I may be obliged&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He snorted contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Obliged! Jumping cats! I'll talk to him if he starts anything of that
  kind. The future Lady Lowbridge isn't going to figure in a puppet show."</p>

  <p>She squeezed his arm affectionately.</p>

  <p>"Clive, you've other things to think about than marriage&mdash;and so have
  I, my dear. Do you know Pips?"</p>

  <p>The car had pulled up before her lodging in Park Road.</p>

  <p>"Orange or lemon?" he asked, as he helped her alight.</p>

  <p>"Pips&mdash;Pawter's Intensive Publicity Service? They are advertisers and
  press agents. And they have the further handicap of employing the most
  insufferable young man in London. Clive, that youth haunts me! I'm sure the
  doctor has engaged him to shadow me."</p>

  <p>"What is his name&mdash;I mean the objectionable young man?"</p>

  <p>"Holbrook&mdash;W. Holbrook. I suppose that the 'W' stands for William.
  Mr. van Campe calls him 'Bill,' and so do most people round the theatre. If
  you ever have the chance will you squash him for me, Clive, dear?"</p>

  <p>"He's squashed," said Clive solemnly, and brushed her cheek with his
  lips.</p>

  <p>An hour later he was standing before his mirror, fastening his dress tie
  with great care, a frown on his pink face. A good-looking young man, with the
  classic features that the old Greek sculptors gave to the heroes of
  mythology, he had the clear eyes and the frame of a trained athlete. A series
  of accidents had brought him from the obscurity and poverty of a Chelsea
  apartment, where he won a precarious livelihood from painting landscapes of
  dubious originality, to the lordship of Lowbridge and the attenuated income
  of estates so heavily encumbered that it was difficult to find a labourer's
  tumbledown cottage that did not represent collateral security against an
  overdraft negotiated by his improvident uncle.</p>

  <p>His mind alternated between Betty and the eccentric doctor, in whose house
  he had first met her five years before&mdash;slim, a gaunt-eyed child,
  watchful, suspicious, pitiably ready to shrink at a word, all too willing to
  humour the tyrant who was both parent and guardian to her.</p>

  <p>Finishing his dressing, he rang the bell for his servant.</p>

  <p>"Benson, you used to work in a club before you misguidedly accepted
  service with me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

  <p>"Then you ought to know everybody. I want you to discover who Holbrook
  is&mdash;Mr. W. Holbrook of Pawter's Publicity Service. You'll find their
  names in the telephone directory."</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

  <p>Benson, stocky and broad of shoulder, needed no further instructions. Half
  his attraction to Clive was his taciturnity.</p>

  <p>"And, Benson," as the man was leaving the room, "my cigars have been
  evaporating at an alarming rate. Will you order a hundred of the cheaper
  brand? They need not be bad cigars&mdash;get some that suit your palate."</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

  <p>Benson was unmoved, neither apologetic nor confused. He had seen Dr.
  Laffin slip a bundle into his pocket the last time the doctor had called, but
  it was not his place to report the delinquencies of a guest.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; PAWTER'S SERVICES</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the bright lexicon of Pawter, President, Chairman and
  Treasurer of the Pawter Intensive Publicity Services (familiarly called Pips)
  there was no such word as modesty.</p>

  <p>"What most people call modesty is merely the wish that the authorship of
  anything nice which may be said about them in the Press, shall not be traced
  to them. Modesty is only a fear of ridicule. The very term, used in a
  newspaper interview, is evidence of blatant conceit. When a man says: 'I
  would rather not talk about myself' he just means that he'd rather somebody
  else did it; all the same, he'd like to have the proofs to correct so that,
  if the reporter wrote how he killed five lions, he could make it six.
  Modesty...!"</p>

  <p>"Is this one of those extension lectures I read about, or merely an
  exposition of your philosophy?" asked the patient young man who was Pawter's
  solitary audience. "If it is a lecture, I am bored; if it is a mere
  acriomatic..."</p>

  <p>"A which?" Pawter was startled.</p>

  <p>"Acriomatic. Work that into the Memory ads you're doing. Drag in
  Aristotle&mdash;what right has he to be left out anyway? As I was saying, if
  you are practising for a Rotarian dinner speech, go to it. I'm your
  assistant, underpaid and overworked, but loyal despite. This argument started
  about Miss Betty Carew's association with this yer agency. I remind you in
  case you have forgotten."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pawter spun round in his chair and looked over his glasses. So doing,
  he lowered and exposed the crown of a very bald head.</p>

  <p>"Are you mad?" he asked gently&mdash;so gently that it might be supposed
  that he rather thought it likely, and that it would be best not to arouse
  such homicidal tendencies as lay dormant in the bosom of his hearer.</p>

  <p>"I'm not mad, but I'm getting mighty close to the borderline," said Bill
  Holbrook. "What's all this to do with modesty? And by the way, how can you
  bring yourself to write copy for Gro-Kwik&mdash;Nature's Natural Hair
  Restorer, with a nut like that? Rejuvenates Tired Follicles! And you're a
  churchman!"</p>

  <p>"Never in my life," said Pawter tremulously, "has a subordinate dared to
  speak to me as you have spoken to-day! I would be well within my rights if I
  fired you into the street! Why I refrain I don't know."</p>

  <p>Bill Holbrook took a chair, fished from his pockets a pair of horn-rimmed
  spectacles, and adjusting them to his face, looked owlishly at his employer.
  Bill was twenty-three and pleasantly featured, except for a nose that was
  slightly bent. He played football, and once a great international had used
  his features as a jumping-off place.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tell you, Father Pips," he said solemnly. "I feel you ought
  to know. Yesterday you fired me, to-day you fire me&mdash;you have been
  firing me every day for months. But I do not go. Why? Because I'm the only
  man in England who understands publicity. Yes, sir. The only man. You think
  you do, but you don't. In me you have a genius, a man who Thinks Forward. I'm
  the only member of the staff who is related to you, therefore I'm the only
  member of the staff that has the true interest of the business at heart. When
  you die I shall await the reading of the last will with equanimity. You
  <i>can't</i> leave me out of a controlling interest."</p>

  <p>Pawter sighed again and swung back to his original position. Bill was his
  first cousin, and there were times when he wished that his aunt had never
  married.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, Betty Carew is not a business proposition. I've been sitting on
  her doorstep waiting for a chance to speak to her, but so far she has given
  me the genial reception that is offered to a case of mumps in a ladies'
  college. When I tried to speak to her, she looked round for a policeman.
  Where does she come into this stunt?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pawter looked unutterable weariness.</p>

  <p>"You'll discover in course of time," he said. "I can only assure you that
  the lady will come in."</p>

  <p>Holbrook went back to his little office, and in his mind was a great
  perplexity. What had induced the girl to take this extraordinary decision?
  Advertising schemes and the inducements which brought well-known actresses
  into the advertisement columns were no mysteries to him; but this girl was
  not being asked to put her name to a testimonial of some excellent remedy or
  popular article of furniture: if she fell in with the idea, she was
  deliberately going out to make herself cheap.</p>

  <p>He sat, staring with unseeing eyes at the litter on his desk, his busy
  mind occupied with the problem which Betty Carew's strange conduct had
  raised. Holbrook had no illusions about the theatrical profession; he knew
  something of their lives, knew something of the terrific struggle for
  existence which went on all the time, except among a few favourites of the
  public; he knew, too, how permissible it was to obtain publicity at almost
  any cost, but he was well aware that there was a line over which no
  self-respecting actor or actress would pass, and that line was far behind the
  place that Betty had decided to overstep in this new undertaking of hers.</p>

  <p>And underneath and behind the grotesqueness of the scheme was a something
  which filled him with a vague sense of uneasiness. Somewhere, he had heard a
  theory expounded that life runs backward, from the end to the beginning of
  things; he had the sense of remembering to-morrow, and it was not a pleasant
  memory.</p>

  <p>Twice before he had had the queer experience of recalling events that had
  not occurred. Once, when he was a reporter, he had been sent to a little
  Welsh village to interview a Cabinet Minister whose estate was near by. And
  on the Sunday morning he had gone to church to fill the dreary hours of
  waiting for the one train that could take him back to London. The service was
  over and he was strolling through the churchyard, when he stopped suddenly by
  the grave of a murdered woman whose husband, a lawyer, had been hanged for
  the crime... He knew this, though the husband was pointed out to him later in
  the day as a man of great respectability, whose wife had died a natural
  death. A year later the lawyer was arrested and died the death in Gloucester
  jail.</p>

  <p>And the desk and the red-haired actress suggested
  something&mdash;something terrible.</p>

  <p>"Darn my crazy brain!" muttered Bill.</p>

  <p>He had an appointment with Laffin that evening&mdash;he hated Saturday
  evening appointments, but was anxious to keep this. He wanted his Sunday
  free, for he had planned a trip to Thames head&mdash;Bill was something of an
  explorer.</p>

  <p>Clearing up some urgent work that awaited him, he was surprised by the
  arrival of his chief, Mr. Pawter's weakness being a hatred of all physical
  exercise, and Holbrook wondered why he had made the perilous journey from his
  palatial office to the mean abode of genius.</p>

  <p>"I was going to tell you, Holbrook, that I wanted you to call on Mr.
  Lambert Stone, the lumber millionaire, on Monday before you come to the
  office. Stone arrives in London to-day, and I've got the rough draft of a
  scheme which I think might attract him. Will you fix up an appointment?"</p>

  <p>"Lumber?" Bill Holbrook looked dubious. "I don't see there's a selling
  value in that."</p>

  <p>"There's a selling value in anything, you poor, slow-witted oaf," said
  Pawter, mildly offensive. "Get the appointment, and then come back to me for
  the scheme. You're seeing the doctor, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>Bill nodded.</p>

  <p>"And I wish you'd find out to-night what's behind this desk stunt," said
  Pawter, staring out of the window and scratching his head irritably. "The
  desk is nothing&mdash;I think I've said that before&mdash;and I can't imagine
  people spending money on the proposition in the hope of getting it back. I
  hate to knock a client's goods, but this old desk has all the disadvantages
  of most and none of the attractions of some. Get Miss Carew's views on the
  subject."</p>

  <p>Bill Holbrook sneered.</p>

  <p>"Show me an actress with real views on anything, and I'll show you a
  professional misfit," he said cryptically, and then: "Pips, I'll tell you
  what is behind that desk. Murder! I smell blood! Wilful murder... maybe the
  crime of the century!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pawter's round eyes were wide open.</p>

  <p>"It is curious that you should say that," he said. "That desk was invented
  by a butler who was hanged in Oxford jail for killing his wife&mdash;Laffin
  told me so."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; CAPTAIN HARVEY HALE</h2>

  <p class="first">OUTSIDE the East India Dock Gates lies an area of squalor
  and meanness which has no exact parallel in any other part of London. It is a
  district of poor, jerry-built streets, wherein every house is exactly like
  every other house, save that it is difficult to distinguish which is the
  grimier.</p>

  <p>Lyme Street, which lies midway between Silvertown and Canning Town, was
  once distinguished by the existence within its narrow length of five distinct
  public-houses, all of which did a noisy trade. Temperance reformers cited
  Lyme Street as an object lesson and a terrible example. Visiting social
  reformers from other lands were led fearfully to its dingy purlieus, and
  novelists and playwrights sought, amidst its foul approaches, the <i>mise en
  scène</i> for such deeds of depravity as were necessary to the development of
  their creations.</p>

  <p>Of all the saloons that disgraced a civilised city, The Full Rigged Ship
  was the worst, and when this infamous house of the crimp and the harpy was
  purchased by The Christian Society and converted into a Temperance Home for
  Sailors, there was rejoicing amongst the enemies of drink.</p>

  <p>For fourteen years the directors of "Theyome" (as it was called locally)
  fought a desperate fight to establish an attractive oasis in a desert of sin.
  All that mortal men could do, they did. There were lectures on Booze, and
  lectures on Gardens and how to cultivate them; there were most innocuous
  concerts that began with a hymn and ended with a benediction, and addresses
  on The Child: What Will He Become? And in spite of all these
  counter-attractions to the sinful saloons, the heavy trade and the bulk of
  patronage went to The Five Bells and The Dog Watch and similar alcoholic
  institutions, where nobody lectured except on the miserable pay of sailormen,
  and all concerts ended in a free-for-all fight which brought out the police
  reserves.</p>

  <p>Eventually the uplift society "farmed" the home to a knowledgeable
  ex-purser, who ran it on lines that more nearly approached the seaman's
  ideal, in spite of his bonded undertaking that no intoxicating liquid should
  pass the threshold. A club license enabled him to serve surreptitious drink,
  and, human nature being what it is, the whisper, well circulated, that you
  could get a drop of good stuff at "Theyome" brought a new patronage, and in
  the little doorway through which innocent children had tripped to recite to
  the dazed marine, you could take your secret potion from sin-stained
  hands.</p>

  <p>Chief of the new patrons of the establishment was Captain Harvey Hale,
  seventy-five by fifty coarse inches of muscle and bone; a red-faced,
  fishy-eyed, heavy-jawed skipper, without either ship or ticket, for he it was
  who piled the S.S. <i>Gravalla</i> on to the Dame rocks and stood in
  thirty-seventy for insurance which the underwriters refused to pay.</p>

  <p>It was a grievance which Captain Hale ventilated in moments of
  insobriety.</p>

  <p>"Twelve months' hard labour&mdash;for what?" he bellowed. "For losing a
  ship that was a floating wreck. And me that thought first of my men and had
  every boat overhauled before we left Sunderland! And lifebelts all in good
  order and everything! 'Wilfully casting away my ship'! Not a life lost, mind
  you, and me the last to go over the side in accordance with regulations!"</p>

  <p>He did not refer to certain earlier exploits that had come before the
  court which tried him: of a trial in Calcutta for manslaughter, of a court of
  inquiry at Seattle for cargo-broaching, and similar irregularities which had
  been investigated in other latitudes.</p>

  <p>"Maybe they'll engage you as a rum-runner," suggested Taylor, the new host
  of The Home.</p>

  <p>Captain Harvey Hale pondered that possibility. "Maybe that's it," he said,
  "and I'll do it!"</p>

  <p>He glanced up at the clock.</p>

  <p>"Expecting anybody?" asked the other, and Captain Hale looked at his
  companion suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," he said.</p>

  <p>He took a letter from his pocket and read, and was in the act of replacing
  it when he changed his mind, and passed it across to Taylor.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Taylor fixed his glasses and read the typewritten note.</p>

  <p>"I can give you a good job with plenty of money, if you're willing to take
  on an unusual task, that will involve you in personal danger. Will you come
  out of the Sailors' Home in Lyme Street at 10.30? My agent, Mr. Smith, will
  be waiting for you."</p>

  <p>"What do you make of that?" asked Hale. "Rum-running," said the other
  promptly. "There's a syndicate in London that is making a fortune out of
  shipping booze to the States."</p>

  <p>Captain Hale pursed his thick lips.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't sound like rum-running to me, though you may be right. A poor
  sailor has got to take what he can get nowadays. Why, I remember the time
  when I was offered&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was boastfully reminiscent and talkative, till, looking up, he saw the
  hands of the clock at the half-hour, and, rising, threw some money on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Don't go following me, Taylor," he said ominously, and Mr. Taylor, whose
  curiosity had been aroused, and who had already made up his mind that he
  would judge for himself the character and appearance of Hale's visitor, very
  wisely changed his mind.</p>

  <p>There was nobody outside the club when Captain Harvey Hale went on to the
  street, but opposite he saw a man walking slowly up and down, and the red
  glow of his cigar suggested that he was the promised agent, for cigars are
  uncommon, except among American and Scandinavian seamen. After a moment's
  hesitation he crossed the road in the direction of the stranger, who turned
  and walked to meet him.</p>

  <p>"You're Captain Hale? I am the man you are expecting. Will you walk with
  me?"</p>

  <p>Hale glanced at him curiously. There was nothing in the appearance of the
  man to suggest that he was engaged in any sinister project.</p>

  <p>"Where shall we go?" he grunted.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Smith," who evidently knew the neighbourhood, said tersely:</p>

  <p>"Across the railroad, toward North Woolwich."</p>

  <p>It was he who decided the route, and they reached the stretch of road that
  led past the sugar factory without encountering more than half-a-dozen
  people, who were too engrossed in their own business to notice the tall sea
  captain and his companion.</p>

  <p>"This place will do," said the man, and stopped midway between two light
  standards. "Hale, you're broke; you're just out of prison, and you look like
  going back again unless you can find a ship. I'll be frank, Captain, and I
  expect the same from you. You were tried in Calcutta for' killing a young
  apprentice, and it was suggested in evidence that you had two hundred pounds
  from the boy's stepfather to finish him. The jury disagreed and you escaped.
  If you did that for two hundred, how far would you go for five thousand
  pounds?"</p>

  <p>"To hell&mdash;and through," said Harvey Hale promptly. "Who do you want
  killed?"</p>

  <p>The stranger laughed.</p>

  <p>"My friend, that is a big question, easy enough to ask, but hard to
  answer."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going back to prison again if I can help it," growled the big
  man. "That's not my life. Give me any kind of job&mdash;rum-running&mdash;"
  he paused, inviting confirmation, but the stranger shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm not interested in rum-running," he said, and Hale was momentarily
  taken aback.</p>

  <p>"I don't care what it is," he said at last. "Give me a job with five
  thousand in it, and there's nothing I'll stop at. I mean what I say. I've
  never gone back on my promise. Look what they did to me over the sinking of
  that ship. I could have got the owner twenty years, but I didn't blab; and
  when I went in to see him this morning to get a look at the money, he
  threatened to call the police."</p>

  <p>"You went to him this morning to work a little blackmail," said the other
  coolly. "You got a thousand to keep your mouth shut at the trial, and, like a
  fool, you handed it over to the lady you called your wife."</p>

  <p>"If ever I get hold of her&mdash;" began Hale, with an oath.</p>

  <p>"I daresay you'll treat her rough. But you won't: she's skipped to
  Canada&mdash;I know all about you, Hale; I've been studying you for the past
  month or two. Now the question is, are you going to work for me?"</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"Anything and everything. Can you drive a car?"</p>

  <p>"There isn't a car that was ever built&mdash;" began Hale.</p>

  <p>"You may be useful in that respect. And here is another point: you
  suggested just now that you'd commit murder for five thousand. If that's a
  bluff, I may call it. You'll get five thousand, and you will be asked to do
  things which will mean a sentence of penal servitude if you're caught. But it
  isn't five thousand that you're getting, Hale, if the scheme for which we
  want you goes through; it is fifty thousand, and a free transportation to a
  country where you'll never be recognised, and from which you will not be
  extradited."</p>

  <p>Harvey Hale was sober now.</p>

  <p>"Fifty thousand!" he said hoarsely. "You don't mean that?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that and nothing less. Five thousand certain; you can touch the
  money at the rate of a thousand a week. And fifty thousand if we can pull off
  our big job. Are you game?"</p>

  <p>Hale held out his big paw.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything worse than murder?" he asked. "Because, if there is,
  I'll do it!"</p>

  <p>There was a silence, then:</p>

  <p>"Walk with me," said the stranger abruptly, and turned his footsteps
  towards North Woolwich. "I suppose you know few people in town&mdash;few
  well-known people, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"I know a judge and a lawyer or two," said Hale bitterly, "but I don't
  know any of the swells."</p>

  <p>"You will probably be brought into contact with a few," his new employer
  continued, "and I will give you the names of some you must avoid like the
  plague. Do you know Lord Lowbridge? Of course you don't. He is a particularly
  dangerous man, who had better be left alone."</p>

  <p>"I'm not likely to meet any lords," growled the other.</p>

  <p>"You never know, but keep out of the sight of him. He is never to know
  that you're employed by me&mdash;is that understood? Now here are your
  instructions. You will leave the house where you're staying, buy some clothes
  and make yourself presentable, and then take the first train for Newton
  Abbot&mdash;that is in Devonshire. You will put up at a small hotel, giving
  out that you are a sea captain who is thinking of buying a farm. You will be
  able to buy a second-hand car somewhere in the neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"What am I supposed to do with that?" asked Hale, thoroughly interested
  now.</p>

  <p>"You'll get acquainted with all the roads out of Newton Abbot and across
  the moor; work your way to Exeter, and possibly we shall ask you to purchase
  a moor cottage, but it is too early to talk of that. When we want you, you
  will know."</p>

  <p>He stopped under the light of a street lamp, took something wrapped in
  tissue paper from his waistcoat pocket, opened it carefully and displayed a
  small, five-pointed star. It was enamelled green, and in the centre was a
  golden inscription.</p>

  <p>"Keep that," he said. "Show it to nobody&mdash;do you understand? In due
  course you will find a very good use for it. There is one other thing, Hale:
  in Plymouth there is a branch of a society called The Proud Sons of Ragusa."
  "I've heard about that; lots of seafaring men go in for it. They run a
  lottery scheme&mdash;" began Hale, but the other interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"Join up, either in your own or any other name. If you're too well known
  in Plymouth, go to Penzance and join the lodge there. You will find plenty of
  men who will propose you."</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?" asked Hale, peering down suspiciously into the man's
  face.</p>

  <p>"The first idea is that you do as you're told," was the sharp answer.
  "That seems a pretty good idea to me; how does it strike you?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; BENSON</h2>

  <p class="first">BENSON gave a final and an approving glance at the
  tea-table, filled a silver cigarette box from a carton he took from the
  sideboard cupboard, lit a tiny spirit lamp and drew back the velvet hangings
  a little farther so that the scarlet geraniums in the window-boxes could be
  seen with better effect. One casement window was open and a soft breeze
  played with the silken curtains.</p>

  <p>Clive Lowbridge strolled in as his valet-butler was at the window.</p>

  <p>"That will do very nicely, Benson."</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Miss Carew is coming immediately after the matinee. You will see that the
  car is ready to take her home?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord." He paused by the door. "With reference to the young man
  Holbrook, of whom your lordship spoke: he is an American, born in Dayton,
  Ohio, and he was for some years on the staff of the London Dispatch-Herald.
  He is now a junior partner in Pawter's Publicity Agency, being a relative of
  the principal shareholder. He lives in Paddington and is unmarried. So far as
  I can ascertain, he has written two books which were published by a firm in
  Boston, but he has no other peculiarities."</p>

  <p>Lowbridge looked hard at his servitor, but Benson's face betrayed not so
  much as a trace of a smile.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Benson. You have settled down to your new job?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

  <p>"You like this a little better than working in a club?"</p>

  <p>"Much better, my lord&mdash;" he hesitated.</p>

  <p>"But it isn't such a good job as you thought, eh? Well, mine isn't either,
  Benson. I thought I should be spreading myself in Park Lane. My uncle left
  very little money." Benson inclined his head respectfully.</p>

  <p>"I am not surprised, my lord. The late Lord Lowbridge was known to
  me&mdash;I have never ventured to inform your lordship before. I used to work
  at his club in the West End, and I saw a whole lot of him. He spent money
  like water, and I've known him to lose as much as twenty thousand pounds in
  one night at baccarat. The Glebe Club is noted for high play. A very affable
  gentleman. So was his son, who died so suddenly."</p>

  <p>"You knew my cousin too, did you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord. Without wishing to alarm your lordship, there seems
  something constitutionally wrong about the family. The Honourable John died
  of heart failure, and you could have taken a lease of his life; Lord
  Lowbridge a good-living gentleman and as hard as nails, went off in exactly
  the same way a year after&mdash;nobody would have dreamt that his lordship
  was so near to death. And both were under the care of a clever
  doctor&mdash;Dr. Laffin."</p>

  <p>He dusted an invisible speck from the back of a chair. "You know Dr.
  Laffin&mdash;was he a member of the Glebe?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

  <p>A buzzer sounded in the hall, and he went, without unseemly hurry, to
  admit Betty.</p>

  <p>"How serious you look, Clive! Has anything happened?" she asked after the
  greetings were over.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no! Benson is a queer chap."</p>

  <p>"Benson&mdash;your servant?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I find that he knew my uncle, and I guess he knew Laffin too; they
  were both members of the Glebe. That is where my relative dissipated the
  family guilders. I shouldn't be surprised if the doctor hadn't lost a
  considerable portion of his assets under the same roof."</p>

  <p>She sighed as she settled down to pour the tea.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Laffin has always been poor," she said, "and yet he owns things that
  are worth thousands of pounds. One day I went into the study without
  knocking, and he had on his desk a most beautiful piece of jewellery&mdash;a
  great golden clasp studded with diamonds. He was very angry that I had seen
  it, and told me that it was only a worthless replica of the Buckle of Isis.
  But I am sure it was real." Clive bit his lip, and in his fine eyes was the
  shadow of trouble.</p>

  <p>"When did you see this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Over a year ago&mdash;about a fortnight after we had had the strangest
  adventure in Devon. Do you remember my telling you about the monks who
  stopped the car?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"At least, I suppose they were monks," she went on. "I don't know why, but
  I associated the gold clasp&mdash;and it was gold, Clive, in spite of what
  the doctor said&mdash;with that meeting."</p>

  <p>"On the moor?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes: we were very poor at the time, and the doctor was short of ready
  money, though he used to hint of a huge fortune which was coming to him. I'm
  certain he could not have had the buckle before. I think they gave it to
  him." Clive Lowbridge looked at her thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand him," he said. "But he was good to me as a boy, and I
  cannot quite share your dislike for him. For all the years of tutorial work
  he gave me, he did not charge a penny."</p>

  <p>Betty could have pursued the subject, but refrained, understanding his
  reluctance to speak against the man she hated. And she remembered, on the way
  to the theatre, the circumstances that had made it necessary for Clive's
  mother to enlist the services of the family doctor as an unpaid tutor. She
  had been left a widow with a microscopic income; three lives had stood
  between her boy and the title, and the prospect of his inheriting the
  mythical wealth of the Lowbridge estates was a remote one. Laffin had come to
  the rescue&mdash;which was not like him.</p>

  <p>She could never associate the doctor with generosity; there must have been
  some <i>quid pro quo</i>. She wondered what it was.</p>

  <p>When, that night, Betty Carew strolled on to the stage of the Orpheum,
  only the pilot lights were glowing in the battens, for Van Campe was an
  economist, and there was urgent need for economy, as she was to learn.</p>

  <p>From behind the heavy tableau curtains came the sound of tuning fiddles.
  Three shivering chorus girls, wrapped in light shawls, stood in the wings,
  looking dejectedly at the worn scene that, in the bright lights, would be the
  Terrace at Monte Carlo. A stage hand was propping up a flimsy balustrade, and
  the property man, with a clothes basket full of toy balloons, was waiting
  patiently, smoking a surreptitious cigarette.</p>

  <p>It was very cold and very miserable, and Betty wandered disconsolately to
  the little peep-hole in the curtain and stared into the deserted auditorium.
  There were seven people in the stalls, obviously "paper." The pit held a
  fringe of audience&mdash;the first two rows were hardly filled, though the
  doors had been open for half an hour. The young assistant stage-manager
  joined her.</p>

  <p>"Looks lively, doesn't it?" he asked bitterly. "I've seen a bigger
  audience for a troupe of performing fleas!"</p>

  <p>"It isn't very hopeful," she said, and he laughed sardonically.</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> hopeful," he said. "That is all we've got left&mdash;hope! A
  musical comedy that hasn't any music worth whistling, and not enough comedy
  to raise a ha-ha from start to finish, naturally starts handicapped. The
  notice goes up to-night&mdash;you've seen it?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p><i>The Girl from Fez</i> had run for a fortnight. There had been seven
  weeks' rehearsal, and on the notice-board had appeared a typewritten slip.
  She had seen "the notice" before, but at the end of a long and successful
  run. Now this intimation that the play would be taken off in two weeks' time
  brought a little heartache. The last lines of the notice were even more
  alarming:</p>

  <p>"The provisional notice given to artistes on the first night will operate
  as stated."</p>

  <p>"Does that include me, Mr. Tillett?" she asked, recalling this ominous
  warning.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it does, Miss Carew," said the manager. "The governor knew he
  had a flivver before he read the criticisms in the morning papers&mdash;he
  dashed in and got himself on the safe side. La Florette isn't a friend of
  yours, is she?"</p>

  <p>Betty shook her head. La Florette, the thin-lipped French dancer, was not
  in the cast. Van Campe seldom played her, but she sat by his side at
  rehearsals, and in her strange French criticised and sneered and laughed
  derisively, and told Van Campe how much better these things were done in
  France; and Van Campe, who was her slave, cut and pruned, until authors were
  in despair, and the cast in a state of mutiny.</p>

  <p>"Well"</p>

  <p>The manager opened his mouth to speak, when the pass door connecting the
  stage with the front of the house opened, and a fluffy figure floated
  through; from the crown of her waved and henna'd hair to the tips of her
  jewelled shoes she was a triumph of the human dollmaker's art.</p>

  <p>She picked a dainty way through the debris of the stage, and stood before
  the girl, surveying her through a pair of unnecessary lorgnettes. Under her
  make-up Betty grew red at the insolent scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are Carew, yes? I wanted to speak to you. 'Ow do you do your
  'air? It is not peroxide, no? I 'ave admire it. You are a bad actress, and
  your voice, <i>mon Dieu!</i> it is awful, but your 'air is lovely! You 'ave
  puzzle me, so I promised Charles I would ask."</p>

  <p>"And now you have kept your promise, Miss Florette," said Betty, striving
  to tune out the anger from her voice.</p>

  <p>"You tell me&mdash;no?"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to tell you. My hair is as the Lord made it." Betty
  smiled in spite of her annoyance. "I thought I had told you that before."</p>

  <p>La Florette shrugged her thin shoulders.</p>

  <p>"But that is what you would call&mdash;a lie, eh? A little story?"</p>

  <p>Betty's eyes snapped fire.</p>

  <p>"It is what you would call a lie too, I think," she said, with ominous
  calm; "for if you are not pure unadulterated Limehouse, I have never met a
  lady from that district! Your broken English may sound pretty to a Dutchman
  or a Greek, but, unfortunately, I speak the language rather well, and I know
  that, beyond a smattering of Montmarte argot, you are as ignorant of French
  as I am of Chinese!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am, ami?"</p>

  <p>La Florette, shocked out of her pose, dropped her hands to her hips, and
  her shrill voice rose to a scream.</p>

  <p>"I'll teach you to insult an artiste of my standing, you&mdash;you chorus
  girl! Limehouse, am I...?"</p>

  <p>The flow of expletive which followed supplied the answer to her
  question.</p>

  <p>"... and I'll have you fired out of this theatre, Miss, before you're a
  minute older. I've got an international reputation to keep up, I have! I
  don't allow no gutter-bred&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Van Campe appeared, an agitated and rotund man whose hands flashed gay
  lights as he waved them in expostulation and protest.</p>

  <p>"Put her understudy on," he roared. "Pay her salary and throw her
  out!"</p>

  <p>Betty went up to her dressing-room, hot, angry, but triumphant. She had
  prayed for the courage to say all that she had said to Florette. She would go
  to De Fell&mdash;the urbane young manager, who had offered her a part in his
  new production. She grew cheerful at the thought. It was at that moment that
  her dresser knocked at the door "Dr. Laffin, Miss," she said.</p>

  <p>Betty sighed heavily. Here was a shadow not so easily dispelled.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; BETTY CONSENTS</h2>

  <p class="first">DR. LAFFIN, in the brighter light of the dressing-room, was
  revealed as being a little above middle height, but he was so very thin that
  he appeared taller. He was dressed in a funereal black; all the bitter years
  Betty had known him he had worn nothing else. A black, unrelieved except by
  the thin edge of white collar that showed above his high cravat, and the
  occasional appearance of a rim of white cuff at his wrists.</p>

  <p>"Good-evening, child. Why are you not playing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because Van Campe has discharged me," she said recklessly.</p>

  <p>To her surprise his face did not change.</p>

  <p>"Discharged you? Well, well!" And then, remembering the opportunity which
  this piece of news gave to him: "I took a great deal of trouble to find this
  position for you. Still it may be for the best. You will return home
  now?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I shall find other work."</p>

  <p>Sitting down at her dressing-table, he subjected her to a long scrutiny,
  his fingers drumming absent-mindedly on the table-cover.</p>

  <p>"I shall not be able to make you an allowance this time," he said.</p>

  <p>Betty did not expect that he would.</p>

  <p>"I have a little money&mdash;" she began, when he interrupted her.</p>

  <p>"Happily, I can save you trouble. I seem to have spent my
  life&mdash;saving you trouble. It would be wiser if you came home. The house
  in Camden Town has not been quite the same since you left. And the other
  matter is definitely settled."</p>

  <p>He took from his pocket a printed leaflet, and laid it on the table before
  her. She braced herself for the coming struggle. Vulture! He was all that.
  Disaster brought him unerringly to the spot; it was as though her dismissal
  had been arranged by him for that night.</p>

  <p>She read the pamphlet and looked up.</p>

  <p>"This is an advertisement of a desk," she said innocently.</p>

  <p>"Mortimer's Multiple Desk," he murmured. "There is no desk on the market
  like it. But to the outward eye, and at first glance, it appears to be no
  different from other desks. Suppose, however, a beautiful young lady is seen
  in a shop window sitting at that desk. Can you picture the hurrying crowd to
  whom shop-windows are such familiar&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"You mean that you still have that absurd scheme&mdash;that you want me to
  sit in a store window to exhibit myself?"</p>

  <p>And, when he nodded:</p>

  <p>"It may sound a revolting suggestion to one who is a great actress." He
  mouthed the words with a certain satisfaction. "It may seem almost a
  desecration of her art to lower herself to the level of an exhibition. And
  yet, what are you but an exhibitor, Elizabeth?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, I'll do nothing of the kind," she said. Her face was flushed,
  her eyes unusually bright. "I told you on Monday night&mdash;I will not do
  this."</p>

  <p>"The pay is amazingly attractive." Dr. Laffin was apparently oblivious to
  her rising anger. "It is no less than fifteen pounds a week. Your duties
  begin at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and end at four o'clock in the
  afternoon. You need not look at the gaping crowds which will, very naturally,
  gather to witness so remarkable a spectacle."</p>

  <p>"I'll not do it!"</p>

  <p>He looked at her.</p>

  <p>"I fear you have no choice. I wish it. I, who took you from the workhouse,
  where you were supported by charity, and gave you a house, an education, and
  the illusion of parenthood."</p>

  <p>She mastered her anger with an effort.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Laffin, I will do anything in reason. It isn't necessary to go over
  the old ground and tell you that, in spite of the material advantages you
  gave me, my life has been wretchedly miserable. I won't ask for your help,
  and I can get a part in De Fell's new play&mdash;he has half promised
  me."</p>

  <p>He seated himself, carefully dusting the chair with a dark-coloured silk
  handkerchief, that he drew from his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"By the most fortunate chance I have become acquainted with a young man,
  who will be of the greatest assistance to you when your engagement is
  concluded&mdash;he is an authority on the subject of publicity"</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>In a flash she remembered the objectionable youth who had haunted the
  stage door for weeks, and, if she had any doubt at all, it was to be
  dispelled immediately.</p>

  <p>"My young friend is waiting outside; I will take the liberty of bringing
  him in."</p>

  <p>He moved in his furtive, noiseless way to the door, opened it, and looked
  out.</p>

  <p>"Come in, please," he said.</p>

  <p>It was the young man; she recognised him immediately. He was not in
  evening dress; she would have been surprised if he wore anything so
  civilised. His tweed waistcoat was untidy with cigarette ash, his tie had
  slipped down, exposing the brass head of a stud, and his hair needed the
  attention of a brush. To these was added an inkstain at the corner of his
  mouth.</p>

  <p>"I think I've met you before, Miss Carew," he said briskly. "The doctor
  asked me to see you about this desk they're booming. I understand that your
  name hasn't to appear. That is good publicity wasted"</p>

  <p>"Mr?" She paused inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Holbrook&mdash;William. Bill to my friends," he said promptly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Holbrook, I want you to understand clearly that I shall do nothing so
  utterly humiliating as you have suggested."</p>

  <p>"I didn't&mdash;" he began, but she signalled him to be silent.</p>

  <p>"I have no illusions about my work," she said. "I am not a brilliant
  actress, and I never dreamt that I was. But I have enough respect for myself
  and my&mdash;my art to reject this suggestion. I have no intention of sitting
  in a shop window"</p>

  <p>"Furnished in the semblance of a handsome library," murmured the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"I don't care how it is furnished. I will not do anything so&mdash;so
  undignified. It would ruin whatever chance I had in this profession, and
  advertise my incompetence."</p>

  <p>Mr. William Holbrook passed his fingers through his untidy hair in
  perplexity.</p>

  <p>"I am rather surprised," he said. "I thought the matter was settled, Miss
  Carew. 'Pips' have only got the publicity end of the desk. We are the
  advertising agents, and this stunt is a new one on me."</p>

  <p>She looked at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Isn't this your idea?"</p>

  <p>"No, my love." It was the doctor. "It is not Mr. Holbrook's idea. It is
  mine. Will you excuse me, Mr. Holbrook?&mdash;I will see you in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>When they were alone, he took up his silk hat, and smoothed the glossy nap
  meditatively.</p>

  <p>"The window will be set on Tuesday," he said. "It is in a side street
  leading from Piccadilly. A very select neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I will not do it," she said. "I am seeing Mr. De Fell on Monday, and I
  hope to open with his new piece."</p>

  <p>The doctor lifted his shoulders in a slow shrug.</p>

  <p>"Open by all means," he said, "and the night you appear there will be men
  outside the theatre distributing handbills telling the world that you are the
  daughter of a man who was hanged at Oxford Prison for the murder of your
  mother." The girl turned white.</p>

  <p>"You would not dare it would be cowardly, brutal... you would not
  dare!"</p>

  <p>Dr. Laffin never smiled. When he was amused, the skin about his eyes
  wrinkled for a second, as it wrinkled now. With that slow deliberation, which
  marked his every movement, he put his hand in his breast pocket and took out
  a leather case.</p>

  <p>"I have never shown you this," he said, and unfolded a newspaper cutting.
  "Listen!"</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">"'This morning at nine o'clock, James Setherby Caren, a
  butler, of Nash Terrace, Bath, suffered the extreme penalty of the law at
  Oxford jail, to which he had been transferred after his sentence at the Bath
  Assizes. It will be remembered that Caren, who had been drinking heavily,
  shot his wife in a moment of drunken frenzy. The child, Elizabeth, who was
  such a pathetic figure at the trial, is now an inmate of Bath Workhouse.
  Caren, who expressed his penitence for his crime, walked firmly to the
  scaffold, and death was instantaneous. The man, who seems to have been above
  the average order of intelligence, enjoyed some local fame as an
  inventor.'"</p><br>

  <p>Dr. Laffin folded the paper, and replaced it in the case. "You were rather
  young to remember the trial," he said, "but I dare assert that you remember
  how a disinterested physician rescued you from a pauper home, and gave you
  the advantages of an education?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer. Young as she had been, she remembered that vividly.
  Remembered the pallid man in the dock, the red-robed judge, the bustle of the
  little courthouse. She recalled a chill morning when the workhouse matron had
  come to her and patted her head kindly and given her an apple. There was a
  little gutter child in the same dormitory, who, when the matron had gone,
  pointed a skinny finger at her, and shrieked with elfin laughter:</p>

  <p>"Her father got hung this morning!"</p>

  <p>She did not know what "getting hung" meant at the time&mdash;she knew it
  was something very final, because the matron told her, to her relief, that
  she would never see the big, wicked man who beat her mother any more. For
  this she was glad, but she wanted to see her mother, and cried and cried at
  nights because there was no rough hand to hold hers, and no thin, weary voice
  to tell her fairy stories.</p>

  <p>"I will dispel any mistaken ideas you may have as to my motive," the
  doctor went on. "You were an experiment: I wanted to see how impressionable
  was the plastic mind of childhood. As an experiment you were a failure. You
  have now an opportunity of repaying me for the care I have shown and the
  expense I have incurred on your behalf. The desk you will advertise was one
  of your late father's precious inventions. It is valueless."</p>

  <p>She shuddered, in spite of herself, and in that moment she hated him with
  a hatred that overmastered all other emotions.</p>

  <p>"You will do as I wish?"</p>

  <p>Controlling her voice, she said:</p>

  <p>"If I do this, it will be the last service I will render you." Again the
  skin about his eyes wrinkled.</p>

  <p>"Not the last. There is yet one more&mdash;a negative service. Now and for
  ever you will forget that I was ever stopped on Dartmoor one stormy night.
  You understand? You will forget also about a certain gold buckle you saw. If
  you ever speak to a living soul about that, you will speak no more!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; AT THAMES HEAD</h2>

  <p class="first">BETTY CAREW might have prayed, and did pray, for deliverance
  from many evils, great and small. That she had failed to include a
  supplication for quittance of an untidy young American, who spent his work
  days in the office of Pawter's Intensive Publicity Agency, and his Sundays in
  inexpensive exploration, was brought home to her with force on the sunny
  Sabbath that followed her interview with Dr. Laffin.</p>

  <p>Betty was on one side of the Thames, Bill Holbrook on the other, and Betty
  was surrounded by a large wasp. Betty hated wasps, and apparently this
  particular wasp hated Betty, for its "z-u-u-u!" held a ferocity of purpose
  which was terrifying.</p>

  <p><i>"Vespa vulgaris!"</i> murmured Bill with satisfaction "A hymenopterous
  insect of the family <i>vespidae</i>."</p>

  <p>It pleased him immensely that from the lumber room of his mind he could
  withdraw that stick of superior nomenclature.</p>

  <p>And then Betty gave a scream. To her, <i>vespa vulgaris</i> was just plain
  wasp, and it had made an angry dart toward her face. She shrank back, one
  foot went into the water, but by an effort she recovered her balance. In
  another second Bill had leapt across the Thames to her side, and with one
  sweep of his soft hat had sent the vulgar vespa to destruction.</p>

  <p>"Saved," he said, made a false step and went calf-deep into very cold
  water.</p>

  <p>"You might have come before," she said tartly. "You saw the horrid thing
  attacking me."</p>

  <p>His eyes looked a reproach.</p>

  <p>"Not every man would leap across the Thames&mdash;that river which carries
  the commerce of the world upon her broad bosom"</p>

  <p>Betty Carew was not amused. They were perched precariously on the rocky
  edge of a little pool that flowed through a grating to a mill pond. Above the
  grating, a grey-green stone announced in stately Latin:</p>

  <p>"Here, Father Thames, are Thy sevenfold springs."</p>

  <p>For this was the source of the historic river, and about them were the
  rolling hills of Gloucestershire.</p>

  <p>"Anybody could jump the Thames here," she said scornfully. "A rabbit could
  jump it!"</p>

  <p>"Put me down as being no better than a rabbit," he said with a quiet
  dignity. "And as to your ingratitude, we will overlook that. One doesn't
  expect it nowadays. The war has changed people's manners and cut away much of
  the silk linings of behaviour. Fortunately I was here. People have been
  killed by wasps. I know a man who never passes a wasp-hive, or whatever they
  live in, without turning pale. Personally, the wasp was never hatched that
  could scare me. May I see you home?"</p>

  <p>Betty at the moment was accepting the temporary use of his arm to reach
  the edge of the pool,</p>

  <p>"No, you may not see me home. I don't live here&mdash;as you well know,"
  she said a little breathlessly. "I am greatly obliged to you, but I don't
  think you ran much risk."</p>

  <p>He looked down at the soaked trouser leg and lifted his eyebrows
  significantly.</p>

  <p>"Any man who saves a popular actress from the malignant pursuit of a wasp
  deserves well of his country, Miss Carew," he said, and she went pink with
  annoyance. "I should have recognised you, even if I hadn't met you last
  night," said Bill, wagging his head. "There's nobody in the world with hair
  like yours. Think better of it, Miss Carew. Place yourself in the hands of
  Pips, or, better still, in mine, and I would make you famous in a month. I'm
  the man that put Stop-Leak Waxoline on the top of the market. You know
  Waxoline&mdash;the Putty with a Punch?"</p>

  <p>She had disliked him instinctively before; she hated him now. He was so
  young, so horribly self-satisfied and so terribly common. Nor did his frank
  admiration of her hair soothe her. Betty's hair was admittedly wonderful. It
  had the colour and bloom of sunset corn, a red through which the gold shone
  so insistently that the redness did not appear until it was caught by a ray
  of light. And under the hair were features that could not be faulted, and a
  skin of delicate texture&mdash;such skins as that colour of hair so often
  favour.</p>

  <p>"I think you should know that I can find my way back to the&mdash;the car
  without assistance," she said coldly, as, against her will, he helped her up
  the steep slope to the road.</p>

  <p>She was a little out of breath from the stiff climb, uncomfortably warm
  and feeling something at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>"I'll come round and talk this over with you, Miss Carew," he said
  gravely. "Pips can give you fame. A corporation like ours that can make
  people look for the label on a paint can, wouldn't have much trouble in
  placing your name in half-watt blinders&mdash;and Pips are reasonable. So far
  as I am concerned, it will be a labour of love&mdash;and for fear I raise
  your hopes, I will add that 'love' is only used in a Pickwickian sense. What
  I mean is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But she was walking rapidly down the road to the little village where the
  joy wagons were parked, and her fury was only discernible by the vigour and
  length of her stride.</p>

  <p>Stillwell's Select Charabanc Tours had brought her that Sunday the hundred
  miles which separated the head of the Thames from the City of the Eighteen
  Bridges&mdash;which is London. These same tours, but a different car, were
  also responsible for the presence of Bill Holbrook. They ran from Trafalgar
  Square on Sunday mornings, and for a ridiculously small sum one might be
  insured of a day in the country and the association of a superior
  company&mdash;for these were select tours. The employment of that qualifying
  adjective suggested that Mr. Stillwell spent his time between tours examining
  the social credentials of his clients.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Mr. Stillwell must have been ill during the week preceding
  this particular Sunday, and handed over this selective function to a careless
  subordinate, since the people who rode in Betty's coach were members of no
  exclusive social set. There were stout women who brought luncheon baskets and
  ate throughout the journey, riotous young men who carried refreshments in
  bottles, mothers of families who brought their responsibilities with them, a
  vinegary spinster or two who complained about the hardness of the seats and
  the dustiness of the roads and their bitter humiliation at finding themselves
  in such low company; but there was no social leader of any standing.</p>

  <p>Happily, Mr. Holbrook was accommodated in another coach. Or he had been
  until the tour began its homeward journey. Then she saw him, wedged between
  two voluble ladies who shouted at one another across him; he was on the front
  seat of the wagon, and far enough removed from her to make conversation
  impossible.</p>

  <p>The great, lumbering coach rolled across the dreary plain which separates
  Cheltenham from Oxford. Clouds had come heaping from the west; ahead the
  skies were a coppery grey. Somebody in the front seats began to sing a
  doleful song about mother. Betty shivered and drew her wrap a little closer,
  though the afternoon was warm to the point of discomfort. Once she saw the
  annoying young publicity agent glance round at her a little anxiously. He was
  wondering whether thunderstorms scared her&mdash;and that a storm was
  gathering he knew long before the first growl of thunder insisted above the
  noise of the coach, and the big spots came splashing down.</p>

  <p>On the outskirts of Oxford the three coaches stopped, and, as usual, at a
  place of refreshment. Most of Mr. Stillwell's select company descended to
  fortify their nerves for the coming ordeal. The remainder of the journey
  would be even more musical thought Betty in dismay.</p>

  <p>They were not alone in the caravan sense. Drawn up on the broad gravel
  campus before the Five Stars Inn were three huge joy wagons, but whereas Mr.
  Stillwell's select conveyances bore no more than his name in letters of
  modest size and irreproachable character, these charabancs wore sheets that
  covered the backs of each car and were lettered conspicuously:</p><br>

  <p class="sign">The Proud Sons of Ragusa<br>
  (Pride of the Medway Lodge 95)<br>
  Annual Picnic</p><br>

  <p>As Stillwell's wagons came to a halt, the inn was disgorging the proud
  children of Ragusa, and one wagon was already filled ready for departure.</p>

  <p>A quiet, yet cheery crowd of men, women and children in their Sunday best,
  were these Ragusans, even if their green and gold rosettes lent them an air
  of hilarious gaiety.</p>

  <p>Betty, who had got down to stretch her cramped limbs, watched them,
  puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Who on earth are the Proud Sons of Ragusa?" she asked, and could have
  bitten her tongue when she discovered that, unconsciously, she was putting
  the question to the objectionable young American.</p>

  <p>"You've asked me one too many," said Bill. "I only know that it is a
  society of some kind. Cute little name, isn't it? Sons of Ragusa! Name seems
  kind of familiar. Say, Miss Carew, what's the idea of this desk stunt? I
  meant to ask you before, but you were so mad at me that I hadn't a
  chance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Betty was already moving away. Of all the things she did not wish to
  do, she placed an exchange of confidence between herself and Mr. William
  Holbrook in the forefront.</p>

  <p>Along the road she had seen a bush pink with dog-roses, and although
  dog-roses are notoriously without vitality, the plucking of them would occupy
  time.</p>

  <p>Out of the corner of her eye she saw the offensive young man hesitating;
  some remnant of decent feeling restrained him, she noted with satisfaction.
  Perhaps she had penetrated beneath his thick skin, or, what was more likely,
  he had not the gift of perseverance.</p>

  <p>She picked her roses undisturbed, save by the swift rush of a little car
  that came flying past in a cloud of dust which the thunder drops had not as
  yet laid. Then, to her surprise, the car came to a violent halt twenty yards
  beyond her, and began to move backward. Though it was hardly likely that the
  driver wanted information about his route, there seemed no other reason,
  until the machine was abreast of her, and a man leaned out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that Betty?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She gave a little gasp of astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Clive!" She took the extended hand with a sense of deepest relief.</p>

  <p>"Charabanc? Oh, Lord! Whatever made you do it? And I asked you to let me
  take you out! You don't want to go with that lot, do you?" he asked. "Jump
  in."</p>

  <p>He opened the door for her, and she was by his side in an instant.</p>

  <p>"I <i>don't!"</i> she said emphatically. "Providence is working for me!
  They are terrible!"</p>

  <p>As the car, gathering speed, flew past the stationary coaches, she saw the
  young man standing in the portico of the inn, his straw hat on the back of
  his head, a look of utter weariness on his face.</p>

  <p>"I've been to Witney, to my noble house," said her companion bitterly.
  "You've never seen it? You're lucky! It is a horror!"</p>

  <p>She glanced round at him, inclined to be amused, but a deep frown furrowed
  his smooth brow, and the good-looking face was puckered in a grimace of utter
  disgust.</p>

  <p><i>Flick... flick!</i></p>

  <p>A blue ribbon of lightning quivered for the fraction of a second ahead of
  the car, a tree by the roadside burst into white flame&mdash;she smelt
  burning wood as the car spun past, and instinctively nestled nearer to
  Clive.</p>

  <p>"That was a beauty," he said calmly. "We'll run out of this before we
  reach Oxford&mdash;I think we're on the edge of the storm. You're a bad girl
  to go charabanc-ing around," he said. (She thought he was trying to keep her
  mind off the storm, and was not far wrong.)</p>

  <p>"I like them&mdash;the excursions, I mean. One gets into a new atmosphere
  and meets types. Only to-day... well, they were rather awful!"</p>

  <p>Clive laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"What about this show-girl idea of the doctor's?" he asked. "Do you intend
  humouring him?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"You do? Moses!"</p>

  <p>"I must&mdash;for reasons. And Clive, dear, you are to promise me that you
  will not come anywhere near the wretched shop when I am installed. I'd not
  survive your seeing me."</p>

  <p>"Not me. I never go shopping. Benson does all that. Were you in one of
  those decorated barouches&mdash;poor dear!"</p>

  <p>"Where&mdash;oh, you mean the big wagons with their banners? No, that was
  an excursion party. The Sons of Ragusa&mdash;Clive!"</p>

  <p>She uttered a little scream. Twice, three times the lightning stabbed
  down, so close that Betty was for the moment blinded; above the purr of the
  engines, drowning all sound, the crash and boom of the thunder. For a second
  the car swerved&mdash;then straightened.</p>

  <p>She looked at her companion. His face was a shade paler, his wide-opened
  eyes held a something she could not read.</p>

  <p>"Sons of Ragusa!" he said jerkily. "My God... How funny!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE PROUD SONS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Proud Sons of Ragusa were celebrating the inauguration
  of a new lodge, and the opening of a new lodge-room, and Bill Holbrook,
  standing on the edge of the sidewalk, watched with wonder and amusement the
  passing of a procession, which contained six brass bands and some fifty
  silken banners, each representative of a branch lodge except for one, heavily
  embroidered with bullion, and bearing the inevitable golden argosy that
  marked in the parade the symbol of the officers of the district lodge.</p>

  <p>Behind each great banner, borne by two men, marched the members of the
  lodge it stood for, respectable, important, and wearing purple scarves about
  their shoulders.</p>

  <p>Fifty lodges were represented&mdash;Bill Holbrook counted the
  banners&mdash;the Pride of Kent, the Pride of Hampshire, the Pride of the
  Five Ports, the Pride of Limehouse...</p>

  <p>It was a procession of ordinary people&mdash;artisans, factory folk, small
  shopkeepers, a sprinkling of office men, honest, self-conscious individuals,
  some wearing that hang-dog expression which comes to the Englishman when he
  is feeling foolish, a few beaming at the joke of appearing in public wearing
  purple plush regalia, not a few immensely serious, transfigured by the
  unaccustomed publicity.</p>

  <p>The spectacle was not altogether unexpected by Bill Holbrook. He knew that
  odd experiences have a trick of duplicating themselves. If he saw an
  unaccustomed word in a book to-day, he would meet the same word in a
  newspaper to-morrow. On the Sunday he had met the Ragusans in the
  flesh&mdash;he had been waiting all week to meet them again.</p>

  <p>"What have they got to be proud about, anyway?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The policeman, by whose side he stood, smiled slowly, but had no very
  lucid explanation.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you've seen these societies before... Good Templars and
  Buffaloes and Sons of the Phoenix and Knights of the Round Table, haven't
  you? They like it. I'm a member of one myself&mdash;as a matter of fact, I'm
  chief noble of my lodge&mdash;Sons of the Phoenix. But these chaps aren't
  temperance. At the same time it's not a boozing crowd. I thought of joining
  myself. It's worth while. Costs a pound a year, but there's two Argosies, one
  in June and one in December, and they're worth fifty thousand pounds each.
  That's why the order has caught on."</p>

  <p>"Fan me or I'll faint!" said Bill. "What is all this stuff about Argosies?
  I see now! There's a golden ship on every banner. But what do you mean by
  fifty thousand pounds&mdash;a quarter of a million dollars!"</p>

  <p>The policeman looked at him suspiciously. He saw a tall, thinnish young
  man, rather good-looking and untidily dressed. When, later, he moved, he was
  to discover that the youth wore odd socks. Bill was a careless dresser.</p>

  <p>"You're American, aren't you? I thought you was from the bad way you talk
  English. About these Argosies. You pay one pound a year, and you're insured
  for a hundred&mdash;if you join young enough. Then every half-year there's a
  drawing. In June there's a first prize of ten thousand and hundreds of
  others&mdash;at Christmas there's a big bonus and only one prize&mdash;fifty
  thousand."</p>

  <p>Bill watched the tail of the procession, with its little crowd of small
  boys bringing up the rear, until it passed from sight, and the delayed
  crossways traffic was allowed to move.</p>

  <p>"That's a new one on me," he said. "I'll have to consult my police
  adviser."</p>

  <p>Again the officer grinned.</p>

  <p>"You lodge with Mr. Bullott, don't you, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Holbrook was surprised that his fame extended to the Edgware
  Road.</p>

  <p>"I've seen you go in and out; I used to be on that beat. As a matter of
  fact, I didn't recognise you till that bird asked me if you had rooms at the
  inspector's house."</p>

  <p>Bill followed the constable's quick sidelong glance. A few feet away from
  them, gazing after the procession, was a man, who, in ordinary circumstances,
  would not have attracted his attention. Bill had a practice of dividing
  people he met casually into classes; one of these he called "the adequately
  paid," and it was in the last category that he placed the interested
  spectator.</p>

  <p>He was dressed in a well-made tweed suit. He wore a spotless wide-winged
  collar; his cravat was black, his shoes sensible and solid. The face was
  thin, almost intellectual. He had a slight red moustache, and on the bridge
  of his bony nose rested a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles.</p>

  <p>"What do you think he is?" asked the policeman, with a superior smile.</p>

  <p>"I'll guess," said Bill. "He's a floor manager."</p>

  <p>The constable shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," said Bill, "I haven't got him high enough. He's a
  storekeeper&mdash;one of the synthetic intelligentsia. He has socialistic
  tendencies, believes in the land theories of Henry George"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the policeman triumphantly; "not that I know anything
  about his the'ries."</p>

  <p>"I'll try again," said Bill. "He's a clerk in a Government office,
  probably holds some good position"</p>

  <p>"You're wrong, sir," said the officer, enjoying his mystery.</p>

  <p>"Then what is he?"</p>

  <p>"He's a burglar."</p>

  <p>The policeman made the startling statement with great calm.</p>

  <p>"That is Toby Marsh," he went on, before Bill could recover from his
  shock, "one of the cleverest cracksmen in London&mdash;he's only been caught
  once, and that was by accident."</p>

  <p>At that moment the spectacled eyes turned and surveyed the two men in a
  scrutinising, unabashed stare. In another instant he had resumed his
  inspection of the procession.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to talk to him. Bring him over."</p>

  <p>"Me?" said the officer, aghast. "Good heavens! I couldn't do that! Why,
  he'd tie me up in knots! Ordinary kind of police don't deal with people like
  that," he explained. "You see, we've got nothing on him, and the plain
  clothes branch doesn't thank you for interfering with that kind of
  feller."</p>

  <p>At this moment, "that kind of feller" walked away from them, and
  disappeared in the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Besides, you never know whether chaps like that are working for our
  people or not. Though I wouldn't say Toby was a 'nark'."</p>

  <p>"Nark?" said the puzzled Bill. "Oh, you mean a stool pigeon. I get
  you!"</p>

  <p>"All the same," the policeman went on, "a high-class burglar can be very
  useful to Scotland Yard, and if I started getting fresh with him, the chances
  are I'd get a rap over the knuckles to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>There was a time when Bill Holbrook would have followed the exclusive Mr.
  Marsh, and wrung from him a crisp column for the <i>Dispatch-Herald;</i> but
  journalism belonged to the past. Bill was now a business man, an expert on
  matters pertaining to publicity; and although his connection with Fleet
  Street was necessarily unbroken, it was rather as a supplicant for free
  advertisement than a contributor of news that he appeared.</p>

  <p>The initiative in the matter, however, was taken out of his hands. He had
  said good-night to the policeman, and had turned into Cambridge Terrace, when
  he saw Toby Marsh a little ahead of him. He was standing with his back to the
  railings, in the attitude of one who was waiting for somebody, and Bill would
  have passed him, but suddenly the man moved across the path to intercept
  him.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir."</p>

  <p>His tone was that peculiar falsetto, which a certain class regard as an
  easy advertisement of good-breeding.</p>

  <p>"I observed you regarding the rabble, or, as one would put it, the <i>hoi
  polloi</i>, and possibly you, as a newspaper reporter, are interested in the
  psychology of the lower orders which makes such exhibitions possible."</p>

  <p>Bill was taken aback, both by the elegance of the diction, and the unusual
  nature of the man's opening.</p>

  <p>"The lower orders," Mr. Marsh went on, evidently enjoying the sound of his
  own voice most thoroughly, "have the instinct of imitation. And when the
  instinct of imitation coincides with the desire for aggrandisement, the
  natural consequence is something foolish. Hence the Sons of Ragusa, with
  their pathetic mysteries, their grips, their password&mdash;which, by the
  way, is 'Drake'&mdash;their robes, their cowls, their blue fire initiations,
  their priors, their grand priors, captains of lodges and orders of the day."
  Bill grinned.</p>

  <p>"You seem to have a close acquaintance with the order."</p>

  <p>"All orders are familiar to me," said Mr. Marsh, with a modest and
  self-deprecating gesture. "But the Twenty-Third Degree of the Sons of Ragusa
  more especially."</p>

  <p>He saw the look of mystification in the other's face, and was smugly
  gratified.</p>

  <p>"With the Twenty-Third Degree of the Proud Sons of Ragusa," he repeated
  with relish; "and more especially with the Golden Voice of the Absolute!"</p>

  <p>For a moment Bill stared at him suspiciously. Was he drunk? Apparently Mr.
  Marsh read his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"I am an abstainer, and a believer in prohibition. When I speak of the
  Golden Voice of the Absolute, I speak of a tangible, material being,
  beautiful to the eye, pleasant to the ear&mdash;her terrestrial name is Miss
  Elizabeth Carew!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; NO-ARREST BULLOTT</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL gaped at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Miss Elizabeth Carew? Miss Betty Carew, you mean&mdash;the actress?"</p>

  <p>"As an actress she has never impressed me," said Mr. Marsh.</p>

  <p>He pulled a very ornate gold case from his pocket, opened it and took out
  a cigarette, snapped the case and handed it for Bill's inspection.</p>

  <p>"It cost me twenty-five pounds," he said laconically. "Every time the
  police pinch me, they try to find an owner for it, and after I've kept them
  walking about London till their feet ache, I introduce them to the jeweller
  from whom it was purchased. It is one of my recreations. Yes, sir, Miss Betty
  Carew is the lady to whom I refer."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear, good man, what the devil are you talking about?" asked the
  irritated Bill. "Voice of the Absolute... Twenty-Third Degree do you suggest
  that Miss Carew is a member of this amiable order?"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head. His eyes were alight with a mischievous
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"I saw you talking to the 'flattie'*&mdash;daresay he described me, and
  with perfect accuracy, as a burglar. To such clods as P.C. Simmonds and his
  kind, I am nothing more. With their lack of imagination it is almost
  impossible that they should see below the surface, and discover an intellect.
  The police have no mysteries&mdash;the introduction of the finger-print
  system destroyed whatever romance remained in the business of thief-catching.
  But when you see Bullott&mdash;a pleasant, but somewhat inexperienced
  officer&mdash;will you be good enough to mention to him my few remarks in
  regard to the Twenty-Third Degree?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ * London thieves' <i>argot</i> for uniformed
  policeman.]</p>

  <p>And, lifting his hat, he stalked away, leaving Bill with that baffled
  feeling, which came to the old-time heroes of fairy stories, who heard cows
  speak and fish proclaim their royal origin.</p>

  <p>It was Bill Holbrook's fortune to be the sole boarder of a Sub-Inspector
  of Police, a quiet, uncommunicative man, young looking, considering his rank,
  and interested (outside of his own work, about which he never spoke) in the
  breeding of canaries.</p>

  <p>Bill had two excellent rooms, a view of a garden, which in summer was a
  joyous vision, and a large share of liquid melody, which the song birds
  provided. That night, when he was puzzling out the strange words of his
  newest acquaintance, there came a tap at his door, and in response to his
  invitation, his landlord appeared in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! Come in, Mr. Bullott. Do you want me? Don't put your pipe
  out."</p>

  <p>"I was wondering if you'd let me have one of your papers."</p>

  <p>There was a pile of newspapers on a shelf, and Bill pointed.</p>

  <p>"Help yourself&mdash;they're all there. Did you wish any particular
  one?"</p>

  <p>"<i>The Times</i>&mdash;I wanted to see if that agony was in again. I
  didn't have time at the Yard; the Deptford murder kept me busy."</p>

  <p>Getting up, Holbrook found the newspaper.</p>

  <p>"Which agony?" he asked. He had all the reporter's curiosity, and Bill
  Holbrook might label himself publicity expert and advertising genius, but he
  was newspaper man all through.</p>

  <p>"Here it is."</p>

  <p>Bullott folded the paper and pointed.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><i>"Sylvia. I'm calling. Be ready to pung. Green
  Dragon."</i></p><br>

  <p>"What the dickens does that mean?" asked Bill.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bullott puffed his pipe vigorously&mdash;it was evidence of his
  enjoyment of the mystification.</p>

  <p>"It is a <i>mah-jongg</i> term&mdash;the Chinese game that has caught on.
  Green Dragon is one of the tiles, and when a player says 'I'm calling' it
  means that he only wants one piece for game. To 'pung' is to complete a three
  or a pair. Two days ago the same kind of ad appeared, only this time it said,
  'East Wind. Hurry.'"</p>

  <p>"East wind?"</p>

  <p>"The four players at <i>mah-jongg</i> are called after the four winds.
  East is the chief player. It may be an advertisement for the game. On the
  other hand, it may be a code message between two silly young people. Thank
  you."</p>

  <p>He handed the paper back, and, having acquired for the time being a habit
  of loquacity, seemed loth to leave. And then Bill remembered Mr. Toby Marsh
  and his remarkable behaviour.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you've had a few queer folks through your hands at times?"
  asked Bill, by way of opening.</p>

  <p>The inspector shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've never had a real case&mdash;never arrested a man in my
  life&mdash;never been in a witness-box in my life."</p>

  <p>Sub-Inspector Bullott made the confession with the melancholy pride that a
  penitent confesses his sins.</p>

  <p>Bill could only stare at him.</p>

  <p>"You've never&mdash;oh, Lord! Why are you in the police? Wherefore the
  badge and insignia of your exalted rank? A <i>policeman</i>!&mdash;I don't
  believe you."</p>

  <p>The inspector sighed.</p>

  <p>"It's a fact. A perfectly terrible memory has been my ruin," he said.
  "They took me off my beat when I was constable before I'd ever seen a man
  kick a dog&mdash;why, I never so much as pinched a Percy for speeding! I was
  on a dull beat where nothing happened except when it rained."</p>

  <p>"What happened then?" asked the unsuspecting Mr. Holbrook.</p>

  <p>"It rained," said the other laconically. "It was just a good-class
  residential district, where they believe in hell and look forward to the
  annual flower show. You know the kind. The worst crime that was ever
  committed on my territory was wearing last year's hat to a wedding. But I'd
  got a trick of memorising motor-car numbers&mdash;you can learn it. I could
  hold in my head four hundred numbers and tell you who drove, man or woman,
  and how many passengers the flivver carried. And one day the flying squad was
  out looking for Joe Stortling, the hold-up man, and they sent round to know
  if anybody had seen his car. I remembered the number, and where I had seen
  it. When the inspector in charge discovered my gift, they turned me out of
  Brockley and put me in Records. I know every habitual criminal that ever went
  inside. I could recognise three hundred American crooks and nearly as many
  French; I can read at a glance any finger-print you put in front of me, but
  if I was called upon to pinch a man, I'd be more embarrassed than the
  prisoner."</p>

  <p>Bill was regarding him in awe.</p>

  <p>"You poor soul!" he said in a hushed voice. "I've met the type, but in
  other spheres. You're the Child that Never Went to a Party! Gosh! Don't you
  ever want a real honest cop, Bullott?"</p>

  <p>To the mild blue eyes of his landlord came a strange gleam.</p>

  <p>"Don't I! And I'll never get promotion any other way. But when I ask them
  for a 'street,' they smile, and say: 'Things have changed since you were
  outside, Bullott.' They've got a notion that I sleep in the office, and have
  never seen a motor-car. They think if they let me loose in London, I'd be run
  over by a motor bus."</p>

  <p>Bill cogitated profoundly, his eye upon the inspector's face.</p>

  <p>"Can't you break into a case&mdash;sort of get on to it before any of the
  divisional police come on the spot? They wouldn't send you away. You're a
  Yard man."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," said Mr. Bullott vaguely, as he filled his pipe. "No, I
  guess they wouldn't. As a matter of fact, the
  chief&mdash;McPherson&mdash;said to me only the other day: 'Get into any good
  case, and you can have it&mdash;pick anything that comes up to your
  department for identification and grab on to it,' but, Holbrook, I haven't
  seen a case worth changing my slippers for."</p>

  <p>"Oh, by the way"&mdash;Bill suddenly remembered&mdash;"do you know a man
  named Toby Marsh?"</p>

  <p>"Burglar," said the other promptly; "twice charged and once convicted.
  Height sixty-five inches spare build, light blue eyes, wears glasses, two
  incisor teeth missing. Lives in Robbs Road&mdash;which is a well-named
  thoroughfare for a man of his profession&mdash;Maida Vale; uses very long
  words, and has a hobby for prying into other people's affairs. Yes, I know
  him."</p>

  <p>"So I gather," said Bill drily. "I met him to-day. He's a mysterious kind
  of person."</p>

  <p>Bullott nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's his hobby, mystifying people. When he was caught some years
  ago breaking into a City office, the only thing he said to the officer who
  arrested him was: 'Mrs. Collitt is going to get married again; you'd better
  tell Collitt.'"</p>

  <p>"And did she?" asked Bill.</p>

  <p>"She did," said the other grimly. "Don't you remember the case, Mr.
  Holbrook? You were on the <i>Dispatch-Herald</i> at the time. Mrs. Collitt
  ran a milliner's business in Oxford Street&mdash;a youngish looking
  woman."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, yes!" gasped Bill. "Her husband disappeared, and they found
  him buried under the centre flower-bed in his garden. She got a lifer. Did
  Toby Marsh know all about that?"</p>

  <p>"Months before it happened," said Bullott. "I remember that so well,
  because it was the first time I had been in a prison. I went down to Dartmoor
  to interview him, but he was mum as a mummy. Why, what has he been
  saying?"</p>

  <p>He had been on the point of leaving. Now he closed the door which he had
  half opened, pulled up a chair, and, under the stimulus of interest, was
  galvanised into a new being.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't tell you what he said or what he meant, except that he
  mentioned a lady's name, and said that she was the Golden Voice of the
  Absolute."</p>

  <p>"Golden Voice of the Absolute?" repeated Mr. Bullott slowly. "In what
  connection?"</p>

  <p>"He was talking about the Proud Sons of Ragusa&mdash;you've heard of
  them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I've heard of them," said the other, almost impatiently.
  "They're a society which run a lottery; they have yearly and half-yearly
  drawings. The society was founded by a man named Leiff Stone, a crazy
  American who believes in theosophy and ghosts&mdash;Absolute!" He smacked his
  knee. "Why, of course, the Golden Voice of the Absolute would mean somebody
  inspired by the supreme spirit of the universe! Now, tell me that all over
  again." He listened tensely, whilst Bill described the Ragusans' procession
  and his subsequent conversation with the burglar.</p>

  <p>"Betty Carew&mdash;that's the actress, isn't it? Yes, I know her. But has
  she anything to do with the Ragusans?"</p>

  <p>"She's never heard of them, I'll bet," said Bill, emphatically.</p>

  <p>Bullott scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-Third Degree? What the dickens is the Twenty-Third Degree? I'm
  going to inquire into this. I'll tell you that this man, Marsh, gets
  information which never comes the way of the police. I don't know how he gets
  it&mdash;probably while he's burgling, for he's working all the time, though
  we've never been able to catch him. Toby 'smashes' queer places. Ordinary
  jewel shops and office safes are beneath him. It's when you hear that the
  Headquarters of the Sunday School Union has been broken into that you begin
  to suspect Toby. Lawyers' offices used to be his long suit. They say he
  learnt enough in twelve months' work to keep him in luxury for the rest of
  his life if he'd been a blackmailer. But Toby never 'put the black' on
  anybody, as far as I've heard. He's just burglar, talkative burglar, if you
  like&mdash;" He drew a long breath. "I'd give a lot of money to know Toby's
  last job!" he said, and Bill saw the fanatical light of the statistician in
  his eyes.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE DESK STORE</h2>

  <p class="first">DR. LAFFIN lived in a large and gloomy house in Camden Town.
  It was a property he had bought when he came to London, and had furnished
  according to his own bizarre tastes. In this house Betty Carew had spent most
  of the years of her conscious childhood. She had a dim recollection of having
  been brought from Bath, and of the terror that this establishment had
  inspired in her youthful heart. It was a very home of shadows and strange
  apparitions. You came upon great bronze Buddhas in unexpected alcoves;
  hideous masks, collected from the witch doctors of Central Africa, hung on
  the walls; uncouth wooden figures of ju-jus appeared in odd corners; whilst
  the furnishing of the doctor's own sanctum might have been the habitation of
  some ancient sorcerer.</p>

  <p>On the day appointed she called at Camden Road, and found Laffin in a
  condition of cold rage. And standing with him in the centre of his strange
  room was a very' interested man, notebook in hand&mdash;his attention equally
  divided between his queer surroundings and the narrative that the doctor was
  pouring out in a stream of malignant eloquence.</p>

  <p>"If I had seen him, there would have been one burglar less in this world,
  Sergeant. Such men should be marked that they can be recognised. I would have
  them blinded as the stealers of deer were blinded in the old days; or so
  maimed that they carried the proof of their villainy through eternity. Let
  the thieving hands be shorn from the body... that is justice."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, Doctor." The detectives of the Metropolitan Police are famous
  alike for their patience and politeness. "I daresay that would be an
  excellent idea, though the finger-print department would kick. When did you
  first discover your loss?"</p>

  <p>"Last night&mdash;late," snapped Laffin. "But the notes might have been
  taken three nights ago&mdash;I locked them in my safe at five o'clock on that
  evening."</p>

  <p>"But something besides the notes are missing?" suggested the
  detective.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a gold statuette of Set, the Egyptian God, a cabalistic ring
  reputedly worn by Darius the Great, a silver chalice used in one of the first
  Eastern churches... but the notes are important."</p>

  <p>"What are they about?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Laffin's basilisk eyes seemed to burn.</p>

  <p>"They were just notes on four sheets of paper," he said evenly, "notes for
  my play."</p>

  <p>Betty smothered an exclamation. His play! Joshua Laffin, who hated the
  theatre and all that pertained thereto&mdash;to whom Shakespeare's only merit
  was that he belonged to the past!</p>

  <p>"Little is to be gained by discussing the matter," said the doctor coldly.
  "The theft of those papers was a freak which shall cost this man dear."</p>

  <p>"If there was nothing of value in 'em, I'm afraid that you may consider
  them as destroyed," said the detective.</p>

  <p>His sympathy was unconvincing, thought Betty.</p>

  <p>She stood aloof from the discussion, for, though Laffin had seen her, he
  took no notice of her presence. At last the detective made his escape, and
  then the old man condescended to favour her with his attention. He made no
  reference to the robbery. She would have been surprised if he had, knowing
  him.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready?" he asked harshly, and without any further preliminary put
  on his hat and led the way into the street.</p>

  <p>The store had been newly furnished and reeked with the smell of drying
  varnish. With the exception of the big window, which had been carefully
  furnished, as he promised, to resemble a small study, the room behind the big
  window was practically empty. At the back of the shop was a smaller
  apartment; into this, Dr. Laffin, who had evidently been here before,
  conducted her. Opening the door, she found, to her surprise, that it was a
  dressing-room, furnished with mirror and unshaded lights, whilst over the
  back of a chair lay a handsome dark-green dress.</p>

  <p>"But I can't possibly wear that," she said, aghast. "It is an evening
  dress."</p>

  <p>As usual, Dr. Laffin made no reply.</p>

  <p>"You'll find a string of pearls on the dressing-table. Be careful with
  them; they are real," he said, in his precise way. "There is another matter
  on which I have already instructed you, Elizabeth; you will find on the desk
  in the shop window a small jade vase, with one red rose. No more than one red
  rose must ever appear in that vase, which must always be on your desk. Do you
  understand?
  It&mdash;must&mdash;always&mdash;be&mdash;on&mdash;your&mdash;desk."</p>

  <p>The position or permanence of the rose did not for the moment interest
  her.</p>

  <p>"But I cannot wear this dress," she said, determinedly. "I refuse to wear
  it."</p>

  <p>He picked up the gown, looked at it disparagingly.</p>

  <p>"We will get you another," he said.</p>

  <p>And then, as he was going out of the room, she stood before the door and
  blocked the way.</p>

  <p>"I am going to know what this all means," she said; "why you are so
  insistent upon my taking this position, why this store is new, and why I am
  to appear in a shop window for the amusement of a Cockney crowd. There is
  something in this which you have not told me."</p>

  <p>"There is a fortune in it; I think I have told you that," he said.
  "Further, I can make no statement. It is my whim, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then it <i>is</i> your store?" She took the point instantly.</p>

  <p>"And if it is?" he asked, his black eyebrows rising.</p>

  <p>"If it is, it is not your money," she said quietly. "You are almost
  penniless. Tradesmen who know my association with you have been to see me at
  the theatre. There are sheriffs' writs against you; one of the tradespeople
  told me this."</p>

  <p>He frowned at her.</p>

  <p>"Who has been talking about me?" he asked sharply, forgetting for the
  moment his precision of speech. "I demand his name! I will punish
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why pretend?" she asked bitterly. "You forget that I have been through
  this before, Dr. Laffin. You haven't forgotten one week when we were almost
  starving, because you had come back from Monte Carlo with every penny of your
  credit pledged?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer her, but stood looking down at the floor, his hands
  tightly clasped behind him, his unpleasing face further disfigured by a
  scowl.</p>

  <p>"You know a great deal too much, my friend," he said.</p>

  <p>He went out, and returned with a weedy little man, whom he introduced as
  the manager of the store.</p>

  <p>"You'll take no orders from him," he said, in that gentleman's presence.
  "You're practically your own mistress. You will come on duty at eleven and go
  off at four o'clock in the afternoon. If the crowd stares at you, there is no
  occasion for you to stare back. I will see that nobody speaks to you when you
  leave the store at night, and a car will be waiting for you to take you
  home."</p>

  <p>It was useless to question him any further. She knew him too well, had
  lived under the same roof too long, to hope that he would be any more
  communicative.</p>

  <p>The first hour of her ordeal was an agony. She had been given account
  books, paper, and began to write aimless letters to nobody in particular,
  trying to forget the existence of the crowd which was gathering, and which,
  from time to time, was moved on by a disapproving policeman.</p>

  <p>She tried hard to concentrate her mind upon some tremendous matter; to
  make up stories, pleasant and unpleasant, which would grip her attention and
  make her forget the grinning faces that stared through the glass. About Dr.
  Laffin and his burglary. Who had been the unlucky thief, she wondered, or
  tried to wonder. It was no use. Try as she did, most desperately hard, she
  could not bring her thoughts from her humiliation. It pleased Mr. William
  Holbrook that morning to make a visit of inspection.</p>

  <p>The store that had been taken for the New Desk Company had a thirty foot
  frontage on one of the most expensive thoroughfares in the West End of
  London. Yet, though it was expensive, it was not, from a shopper's point of
  view, the most desirable site. The headquarters of those corporations and
  houses which would be most likely to patronise this brand-new establishment
  were very remote from Duke Street; and as he came abreast of the house
  agent's office, Holbrook remembered that he had a friend at court in this
  establishment, and went in.</p>

  <p>The junior partner, a man of his own age, expressed all the surprise that
  Holbrook had felt.</p>

  <p>"Why, they've hired that shop front, heaven only knows," he said. "As a
  matter of fact, we rented it to them, and I told them at the time that it
  wasn't the best position for a concern of that kind, but they insisted."</p>

  <p>"For how long have they taken the store?" asked the interested Holbrook.
  "And who are 'they'?"</p>

  <p>"'They' is Dr. Laffin," replied the agent, "and he has taken the place for
  three months certain, and the right to renew for a further period. The store,
  as you may guess, was already let when they applied, and Laffin is merely the
  sub-tenant. The real occupiers are not moving to Duke Street until the
  beginning of next year, so that they were quite glad to rent it to these
  crazy people. By the way, I'm not so sure that they are as crazy as we think;
  they've got a most amazing display in the window&mdash;probably you saw the
  crowd on the sidewalk?"</p>

  <p>"I saw the crowd," said Bill, "and guessed the reason. A lady is working
  in the store window?"</p>

  <p>The house agent nodded.</p>

  <p>"They say she is a very well-known actress," he said. "I went down and had
  a peep at her, and whether she can act, or whether she's merely a musical
  comedy artiste, she is most decidedly a beauty."</p>

  <p>Bill Holbrook grunted. Betty Carew's beauty did not interest him as much
  as the novelty of her position, and the peculiarly unsatisfactory nature of
  his own&mdash;in so far as he represented Pips.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later he stood on the outskirts of the crowd and looked into
  the shop front. In the centre of the "room," at a small and very
  ordinary-looking writing-table, sat Betty Carew, and it was not necessary for
  him to make personal inquiries to see that she was intensely distressed under
  the stares of a London crowd. Her face was averted from the street, but the
  heightened colour of her cheeks, the nervousness of every gesture, told its
  own tale.</p>

  <p>To Betty every moment of that day had been an agony; the clock scarcely
  seemed to move. She felt as if she could die of shame, and once she half
  rose, determining to run away, anywhere, rather than submit for another
  moment to the humiliation which had been put upon her. Her one fear was that
  Clive Lowbridge should see her, and she found her only (and dismal) amusement
  in the thought of what he would do when he made the discovery.</p>

  <p>"Miss Carew!"</p>

  <p>She looked round. The sham door of the study was ajar, and she saw the
  concerned face of William Holbrook. It needed but this last trial to turn her
  misery to madness.</p>

  <p>"Lay off, won't you?" he begged. "I want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>"Please go away." Her voice vibrated with anger. "How dare you come and
  gloat over your wretched work!" Bill glared at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Woman, you're mad!" he said. "Me&mdash;or I, as the case may be? Come
  out!"</p>

  <p>His voice was authoritative, his gesture almost imperious. Without knowing
  exactly why, she obeyed him, and could have sobbed in her relief to be out of
  the range of the eyes.</p>

  <p>"Now, what's this stuff about this being my idea?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Laffin said so."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Laffin is a lying crow," said Bill calmly. "He's a prevaricating
  ghoul! He called us in to run the stunt, and then did it himself. The only
  thing we've got to do is to send out a par to the papers&mdash;he even wrote
  that."</p>

  <p>"What is the paragraph?" she asked quickly. "About me&mdash;oh no, not
  about me?"</p>

  <p>Bill fished out a dozen envelopes from his pocket, and tore open one.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't mention your name," he said, unfolding the contents.
  "Listen:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">"The Red-Haired Girl.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Passers-by in Duke Street are afforded an unusual
  spectacle. A window of one of the stores in the thoroughfare has been fitted
  up like a study, and at a table-desk sits an extraordinarily pretty girl with
  hair of a most amazing red. On the desk at which she sits is a green jade
  vase containing one red rose. The lady is apparently, advertising the desk at
  which she writes, but the effect is a singularly striking one."</p><br>

  <p>"And what good that is, except to bring a crowd, I don't know. Not a word
  about the desk. I think that doctor is&mdash;" he tapped his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Must this go in?" she asked, with a sinking heart, as she realised the
  new crowds which that notice would bring.</p>

  <p>"I hope so," said Bill, "but the 'must' is a matter for a number of city
  editors of divers temperamentalities. Excuse me talking like a burglar."</p>

  <p>She thought that this was some catch phrase, but he went on:</p>

  <p>"Met a regular burglar professor the other day&mdash;he talked like
  Roget's <i>Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She hoped that this hateful young man, at any rate, would go on talking.
  Every second was a second's respite from the dreadful ordeal of the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Half of 'em won't take the par because there's a business end to it.
  Nowadays, the only way you can get free publicity about almost anything is to
  kill somebody with it. But I'm going to tell&mdash;good-morning, Doctor."</p>

  <p>It was Laffin, who had strode through the door, and his lips were
  quivering with fury.</p>

  <p>"Why aren't you at your post?" he asked, quietly enough.</p>

  <p>"Because I asked Miss Carew to come out&mdash;that's why," said Bill
  coolly. "See here, Doctor, you've got me guessing.
  What&mdash;is&mdash;the&mdash;grand&mdash;idea?"</p>

  <p>"Your business&mdash;" began Laffin.</p>

  <p>"Don't do it, doc," implored Bill. "I know what my business is, and I'm
  attending to it; but there's something behind this window show that isn't
  straight publicity."</p>

  <p>He prodded the old man's waistcoat with an inkstained finger.</p>

  <p>"If I wasn't publicity, Laffin, and I was just a low-down reporter, like I
  am at heart, I'd be down at Central Office at this very minute, saying
  'Captain, I've got a good story&mdash;but it's too good for newspapers; send
  a sleuth, or inspector, or whatever you call your high-class cops down to
  question old man Laffin, and maybe he won't come back alone."</p>

  <p>Slowly the colour was leaving Joshua Laffin's cheeks; from yellow to grey,
  from grey to dirty white. By the time Bill had finished, the old man's lips
  were the colour of lead.</p>

  <p>An hour later, Bill Holbrook walked unannounced into the office of Mr.
  Pawter.</p>

  <p>"Your wish has come true, Uncle Pips," he said.</p>

  <p>"Are you resigning?" asked Mr. Pawter, hopefully.</p>

  <p>Bill nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've signed on with the <i>Dispatch-Herald.</i> I'm crime reporter, and
  you'll be wise not to start anything, for you're practically at my mercy; if
  it wasn't a crime for a bald head to market Gro-Kwik Rejuvenates Tired
  Follicles, I don't know what was."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pawter lay back in his chair, aghast.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious? Don't be a fool&mdash;I'm not referring to your cheap
  jest about one of the best hair preparations ever put into the hands of the
  public&mdash;but about this crime reporting. Why? You're getting a good
  salary...."</p>

  <p>"Little, but good," corrected Bill. "No, salary doesn't matter. Pips, I'm
  on the trail of the biggest story I've ever smelt. And, Pips, I'm going to do
  a good turn to the only policeman that has ever stepped to the witness stand
  and perjured himself in a good cause."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pawter glanced up at the clock.</p>

  <p>"The saloons do not open until twelve," he said offensively. "You've been
  drinking out of hours!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; MR. LAMBERT STONE</h2>

  <p class="first">"NO, I'm not drunk, if that is what you mean," said Bill
  without resentment. "I'm talking about a real policeman, though I admit that
  there is something very unreal about him. I've seen Lowther of the
  <i>Dispatch-Herald</i>, and he's agreed to give me the job."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pawter leant back with an air of patient resignation.</p>

  <p>"There are such things as contracts," he said gently, "such words as
  obligations, which probably do not appear in your bright lexicon. You are
  perfectly serious?"</p>

  <p>Bill nodded.</p>

  <p>"Then there is nothing more to be said. It is such a novel experience to
  find you serious about anything that I am enjoying an unusual sensation. I
  shall miss you, in the same sense that a flagellant misses a whip that is
  mislaid. You're a queer, unscrupulous lad, and I like you for it. You keep me
  from being respectable."</p>

  <p>"Let us skip the badinage and come to cases," said Bill. "You owe me a
  month's salary."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pawter sighed, took a cheque-book from his drawer, and wrote
  laboriously.</p>

  <p>"Your job is open when you like to come back to it," he said casually,
  "though the thought of the way you handle this business keeps me awake at
  night. What is the game, William&mdash;seriously?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," said Bill, and sat down.</p>

  <p>For a quarter of an hour Mr. Pawter listened to a series of suspicions,
  and, when his assistant had finished:</p>

  <p>"Very sensational," he said, disparagingly. "It's queer how the merest
  hint of crime arouses your imagination, which, in the operations of this
  business is so conspicuously dormant. By the way, did you see Mr. Stone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've got another interview with him to-day. I like his majesty
  rather much. He's a good, straight, honest citizen, deficient in only one
  respect&mdash;he seemed to think there was something in your advertising
  proposition."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," murmured Mr. Pawter. "Fix that before you leave us, William,
  and, for the first time since you have been working with me, I shall feel
  that your salary hasn't been wrung from the firm by a confidence trick."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stone was not living at an hotel; he had taken a furnished flat in
  Albermarle Street for the season, and it was there that Bill had found him on
  the Monday morning. He was a tall, slight man, with the face of one who lived
  in the open. His hair was almost white; the thin face heavily lined; but
  there was a sparkle of humour which Bill had noticed was almost inseparable
  from the eyes of those giants of industry, who are sometimes labelled
  "captains," and more often "kings."</p>

  <p>His English valet admitted the visitor, and took him straight into the
  drawing-room, which had been converted into something which was half office
  and half lounge.</p>

  <p>"Come along in, Mr. Holbrook," said Stone. "You're staying to lunch?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I have invited my brother, but I very much doubt if he'll come." He
  laughed softly. "You're a newspaper man, aren't you? Or you were before you
  took up advertising?" and, when Bill nodded: "I was certain of that. One
  can't mistake men of your profession; there is something about them that is
  characteristic. English or American, they're all the same. But you're
  American?"</p>

  <p>"I have that distinction," said Bill. "Yes, Mr. Stone, I was a newspaper
  man, and, what is more, I am a newspaper man again. In fact, you're the last
  client of Pawter's I shall see for a very long time."</p>

  <p>"Going back, eh?" The keen-eyed man nodded. "You fellows can never keep
  away from ink. I suppose you're just aching for somebody to discover a
  dismembered body in the river, or maybe you'd prefer something with poison in
  it?" He went on abruptly to the business in hand.</p>

  <p>"This proposition of Pawter's appeals to me. There has never been a
  selling campaign for lumber in this country, and yet you're using it all the
  time. Most of it comes from Norway and Scandinavia. I don't see why we
  shouldn't have a bigger share of the market."</p>

  <p>He talked wood for the best part of an hour, kept his listener working on
  his amendments to Pawter's scheme, and as suddenly as he began, he stopped
  and looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"That fellow won't be here," he said. "It is ten minutes after one, and
  though he has many drawbacks, he has one virtue&mdash;punctuality."</p>

  <p>"Does your brother live here?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he lives here," he said shortly. "I haven't seen him in ten years,
  though I hear from him occasionally."</p>

  <p>"You have been in London before, Mr. Stone?" asked Bill, as he unfolded
  his serviette.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know the country rather well, though I haven't been here
  since&mdash;well, since the last time I met my brother, and then I was only
  in England from Wednesday to Saturday."</p>

  <p>"Do you like London?"</p>

  <p>"No," was the immediate answer. "That is hardly a fair thing to say,
  because as a capital I like it immensely. It is a city of comfort and
  kindness; although the English people are a little thick-headed and a little
  priggish, behind all the disagreeable facets of their nature there is a large
  charity and a courtesy beyond the understanding of most folks who have only a
  superficial acquaintance with them. Leiff would be an Englishman&mdash;I am
  talking about my brother&mdash;if he were anything!" He smiled faintly.
  "There you have an instance of a genius on the wrong track. As a newspaper
  man you must have met them a score of times in the criminal courts&mdash;oh
  no, Leiff isn't a criminal! He has great gifts, but he uses them queerly. His
  life is rather like one of those rivers that run into the desert and are
  swallowed up in the unproductive sand. He would have made a good churchman;
  equally he would have been a great historian. He has just that touch of
  romantic medievalism, which produces fascinating and inaccurate
  histories!"</p>

  <p>He stared out of the window absently, and bit his lip. "Yes, I know
  England," he said, speaking half to himself. "I sometimes wish I'd never seen
  the country, never put my foot upon its shores, and sometimes I'm on my knees
  in gratitude that fate led me to this land."</p>

  <p>He caught Bill's fascinated eyes and laughed.</p>

  <p>"You would like Leiff&mdash;he is one of those charming idealists that
  newspaper men find so refreshing and so rare. If he has any mean qualities,
  it is that touch of the theatrical, which you see in the Sons of Ragusa"</p>

  <p>"The Sons of Ragusa!" gasped Bill. "What has your brother to do with
  that?"</p>

  <p>"He founded the order," said Mr. Stone, his eyes twinkling at the effect
  he had produced upon his guest.</p>

  <p>"Fifteen to twenty years ago Leiff had his great uplift scheme, and laid
  down the plans for his society. I tell you, that man is a natural born
  organiser. In a business man's office he wouldn't be worth two cents a month.
  But give him something bizarre, something fantastical, something that gives
  him an opportunity of introducing the atmosphere of the middle ages, and
  Leiff will work twenty-three hours out of the twenty-four, and spend the
  other hour thinking. He tried to start a branch of the society on the other
  side, but it didn't work. Maybe our people aren't gamblers, for a gamble is
  at the bottom of the Ragusans' popularity. That annual, or semi-annual, bonus
  of his was the inspiration of a genius. It got people interested in his
  society who never would have dreamt of joining. He brought in every class
  from the highest to the lowest, and, incidentally, got round the
  anti-gambling laws of England so effectively that your Government&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not my Government," protested Bill.</p>

  <p>"Well, the Government of England have never been able to take action
  against him. Nobody knows how the fortunate recipients of the argosies are
  chosen. If there is a lottery, nobody has seen the lottery drawn, and no
  announcement has ever been made that it has been drawn. Twice a year some
  lucky people receive a bald intimation that their number has received a huge
  prize. The process of selection is not known, and by the rules of the Proud
  Sons of Ragusa (I'm not so sure it isn't part of their oath) the method of
  choice is not even discussed. There is no doubt about the <i>bona fides</i>
  of the members who have benefited. But how or why the luck should come to
  them is not explained."</p>

  <p>Again he was looking out of the window, deep in thought. "A membership of
  four hundred thousand," he said, and his lips clicked impatiently. "What a
  selling organisation!" After that the talk turned to home politics, to the
  depredations of the cotton boll, and to other matters of peculiar interest to
  a Southerner. Lambert Stone was a Virginian, and although the greater part of
  his life had been spent in the western states, his heart was on the right
  side of the Potomac, and Roanoke was home to him.</p>

  <p>Bill Holbrook went back to his office, delivered the fruits of his
  discussion (with a great deal of self-commendation, coldly received) and
  hurried back to his lodgings to square up some work that he had taken home to
  finish. He had forgotten his key, and when he knocked the door was opened by
  Inspector Bullott, and on the police officer's face was an expression which
  Bill had never seen before. "Hullo!" he said in surprise. "You're home
  early?"</p>

  <p>"I've left the office for good, I hope," said Bullott solemnly. "The chief
  has given me a roving commission, and I'm not going back to that darned
  bureau until I can wear a police uniform without blushing."</p>

  <p>Bill held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Brother," he said, "a new life has dawned for both of us. Bring up a
  bottle of beer, and let's talk murder!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE MAN FROM NOWHERE</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was the third day of Betty Carew's ordeal, and she
  groaned as she turned into Duke Street, and saw the little knot of curious
  sightseers waiting before the store window with its drawn blinds. That
  morning, almost every newspaper had published the "red-haired girl"
  paragraph, with or without variations. The previous afternoon, a string of
  reporters had arrived, and she had dreaded to look at the morning newspapers.
  For the worst had happened; she was identified. One newspaper had made a
  column story headed:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">Actress Finds More Lucrative Occupation Than Stage
  Life</p>

  <p class="headline"><small>Distress among mummers induces Miss Carew to take
  show-girl's job in desk store.</small></p><br>

  <p>Another journal carried a three-column photograph of her at work.
  Mercifully her back was turned, and the intervention of a plate-glass window
  had made recognition impossible. She found one result of the publicity; when
  she arrived there were three letters, all delivered by hand, from theatrical
  managers, offering her engagements. One undertook to produce a sketch for the
  road entitled "The Girl in the Window," with herself as the central figure.
  She tore up the letters in disgust, and, bracing herself, stepped into the
  window and turned her back to the crowd.</p>

  <p>She could not go on; this thing was unendurable. Pulling open one of the
  drawers of the desk (the difficulty she had in opening it was no kind of
  advertisement for the merits of this marvellous piece of furniture) she took
  out a letter. It was the "message" that was to be delivered to the unknown
  caller. What would happen when he came? Would her trial be at an end? She had
  asked Laffin the night before, when he had come for her, but he had made no
  reply.</p>

  <p>It was towards noon, when, out of the tail of her eye, she saw a car come
  slowly up the street and stop just short of the crowd. This was not unusual,
  for curiosity was not confined to the masses. She was conscious that somebody
  was pushing a way through the crowd, but did not turn her head, until
  somebody rapped at the window gently with the head of an umbrella, and,
  turning, her face went crimson. She was looking into the eyes of La Florette,
  and the smile on the dancer's face was maddening. Quickly she brought her
  attention back to the desk, trying to forget the woman, malignantly
  triumphant. And then the door of the shop opened, and there came to her the
  faint fragrance of La Florette's favourite perfume.</p>

  <p>"How very sweet!"</p>

  <p>The little door of the window front had been opened. La Florette, bubbling
  with malicious laughter, was watching her.</p>

  <p>Betty sprang up from her chair, and in two strides had crossed the window
  floor and slammed the door behind her.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to buy a desk?" she asked, her flaming eyes fixed on the
  woman.</p>

  <p>La Florette shrugged her thin shoulders.</p>

  <p>"My dear, what should I do with a desk?" she asked sweetly.</p>

  <p>"That occurred to me, but even the illiterate must have some place to
  scrawl," said Betty.</p>

  <p>Under the rouged cheeks the colour came and went.</p>

  <p>"You insolent little beast!" she spat. "You&mdash;you shop-girl!"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you what you are," said Betty calmly, "because the only
  words I could use are forbidden in decent society. Do you want to buy a
  desk?" she asked again. "If you do not, there's the door!"</p>

  <p>"I shall report you to your employers&mdash;" began La Florette.</p>

  <p>"I'd almost forgive you if you would," said Betty, so earnestly that the
  woman stared. "Have you any business here at all? Because, if you haven't, go
  with the crowd, where you belong, Miss Florette, or Simkins or Snooper, or
  whatever your real name may be. All Limehouse is outside; you can see the
  marks of their unpleasant fingers on the glass. One more or less doesn't
  matter to me."</p>

  <p>It was a long time before La Florette could articulate. Queer little
  sounds of rage and venom came from her thin lips, and she glared
  murderously.</p>

  <p>"You're in your proper place now, Carew," she said shrilly, "where
  <i>you</i> belong&mdash;a show-girl&mdash;an exhibition, a common advertising
  woman." She choked with rage. "I'm going outside," she went on, "I'm going to
  stand and tell people who you are, and what a rotten actress you were. Even
  the newspapers say that you were such a bad actress that you had to take this
  job!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly Betty jerked open the door, caught the woman by the arm with a
  grip that surprised the pseudo-French dancer, and thrust her into the street,
  slamming the door behind her. And then, with no fear, no apprehension, no
  qualms, Betty Carew stepped back into the window and smiled down into the
  distorted face of this exotic, rooted in the slums, and drawing her
  sustenance from the refuse of a Dutch ghetto.</p>

  <p>For fully a second they looked at one another, and then La Florette darted
  into the crowd, pursued by the cheers of the quick-witted gamins who had
  noted her hasty exit and had divined the cause. For the next hour Betty had a
  sympathetic audience.</p>

  <p>The second of the visitors, less welcome, came while she was eating a
  hasty luncheon in the deserted showroom. She heard the quick step and looked
  up into the troubled eyes of the best-looking man in London.</p>

  <p>"Why, Clive," she faltered, "I thought you promised me you would not
  come?"</p>

  <p>"I had to come. Did you see the papers this morning?" he asked savagely,
  and, without waiting for her to reply: "This is monstrous, Betty! I'm not
  going to allow it! I'll see that old scoundrel to-day"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It's perfectly useless seeing 'the old scoundrel'!" she said, with a
  little smile. "Clive, I've got to go through with it."</p>

  <p>He was stalking up and down the room, his hands tragically clasped behind
  him, a frown upon his face.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen anything of that brute from Pawters?"</p>

  <p>"Holbrook?" Again her lips twitched. "I'm beginning to think he's not such
  a brute as I believed," she said, and told him of the little scene that had
  occurred between Joshua Laffin and the man from Pawter's. "I am sure he was
  speaking the truth when he said that he had no responsibility for this freak
  of Dr. Laffin's."</p>

  <p>"He was responsible for the paragraphs in the newspapers," growled Lord
  Lowbridge.</p>

  <p>"He told me about them, and I believe that, if I had insisted, he would
  not have circulated the story," she said. "Clive, have you the slightest idea
  why the doctor is doing this? I think I could bear the indignity if I were
  performing some useful service, but we haven't had so much as an inquiry
  about the desk," she said ruefully.</p>

  <p>His moody eyes were surveying her.</p>

  <p>"How long are you allowed for lunch?"</p>

  <p>"Just as long as it takes to eat. The doctor says I mustn't be out of the
  window for more than ten minutes at a time, and that means that by the time
  my engagement is through I shall have a red nose from indigestion!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'd better stick it," he said, after a while, "though I just
  hate the thought of your being turned into a puppet show. Has anybody come
  for the precious message?"</p>

  <p>He laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"No, and I don't think they will. I sometimes think that the doctor is
  mad&mdash;for the past year he has become obsessed with his theosophical
  ideas. He was always a difficult man to live with, delighting in horrors and
  gloom, but since he has taken up his study of the unknown he has become
  simply awful. I'm afraid I must go now, Clive," she said, rising. "You won't
  stay and stare at me, will you? No, of course you won't!" She squeezed his
  arm affectionately. "Now go. I want you to be well out of sight before I
  assume my great role of Diana at the Desk!"</p>

  <p>She could treat the matter flippantly in his presence, but when he had
  gone there came a return of her despair, and it was with a heart as heavy as
  lead that she dragged herself into the public gaze, and resumed the
  soul-destroying occupation of doing nothing.</p>

  <p>She had put her watch on the desk, and there were times when she thought
  that it had stopped, the hands moved so slowly. Two o'clock came, and three.
  She kept her thoughts upon La Florette, the most occupying subject of any.
  What a day of joy for the dancer, despite her unceremonious exit from the
  scene! Betty did not doubt that the woman would collect every friend, every
  acquaintance that she had, and bring them to swell the curious throng before
  the window. And in this she was not far wrong, for at that very moment La
  Florette was telephoning to Van Campe, busy with the final rehearsal of the
  <i>Girl from Morocco</i>, which he was sending on the road.</p>

  <p>"I want every principal and every chorus boy and girl to go round and take
  a good look at Carew," she said. "I don't care what you're doing; they've got
  to break off some time. Give them an extra half-hour"</p>

  <p>But before the first of the theatrical contingent arrived, the crisis had
  occurred.</p>

  <p>It was nearing four o'clock, the hour at which she left her post, and the
  manager had sent her in a cup of tea. She had almost become hardened, she
  thought, as she sipped the hot, refreshing liquid, to the entertainment of
  her audience. Drinking tea was easier than doing nothing.</p>

  <p>She put the cup away, and had gone back to her aimless scrawlings, when,
  looking round, she saw that for the moment attention had been diverted from
  her to the newest and strangest of spectators.</p>

  <p>He was a gaunt man of middle height; his white face would have attracted
  notice, even had he not chosen to appear in a black cassock buttoned from
  neck to feet. His head was bare, and his hair hung over his collar, a cascade
  of iron-grey. Leaning on a long staff almost his own height, he was gazing,
  spellbound, and it seemed to Betty that he was taking in every detail of her
  face, her dress, her hair, the simple ornamentation of the desk.</p>

  <p>So startled was she by this unexpected apparition that she half-turned to
  face the street, and met his gaze full. Slowly he moved toward the door, and,
  looking down, she saw that his feet were bare, protected only from the road
  by thin sandals that were strapped across the instep and fastened with a
  leather thong about the ankle. The door opened, and, with a thumping of
  heart, Betty realised that the crucial moment was at hand&mdash;that it was
  the man who Dr. Laffin had promised would call, the man to whom the message
  was to be delivered.</p>

  <p>With trembling fingers she took the envelope from the drawer, and, without
  waiting, stepped out of the window in time to confront him. He stared at her
  in silence.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>Twice the heavy eyelids blinked.</p>

  <p>"O wondrous day for me!" he said in a hushed tone. "Speak Golden Voice of
  the Absolute, speak and tell me the hour of my death!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE MESSAGE</h2>

  <p class="first">BETTY was mute. A cold sensation ran down her spine; her
  knees trembled beneath her. Again the old man spoke.</p>

  <p>"O Golden Voice of Supreme Justice, what word have you from the planes
  beyond?"</p>

  <p>She could only thrust forward the letter. It was unaddressed. In the top
  left-hand comer was a queer sign which had excited her curiosity before, and
  which was now to have an extraordinary effect upon her strange visitor. No
  sooner did his eyes fall upon the scrawl than he fell on his knees, and,
  stooping, kissed the hem of her dress.</p>

  <p>"I have your leave to go, O Long Desired?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and, incapable of speech, stood, frozen to the spot, long
  after the door had closed behind him.</p>

  <p>Within ten minutes of his departure the door was flung open, and Dr.
  Laffin came in. He was pale, unusually excited, betraying an agitation which
  was foreign to him.</p>

  <p>"Well, girl, what happened?" he asked, the affectation eliminated from his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said, dully. "What does it mean... that man in the
  strange dress, with the long white hair he kissed my dress. Oh, doctor, what
  does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"You gave him the letter? You're sure&mdash;you gave him the message?"</p>

  <p>Laffin's eagerness was like nothing she had ever seen in him.</p>

  <p>"Change and come home," he said, speaking rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Doctor, I can't come here any more," she said, desperately. "I don't care
  what you do, I can't come!"</p>

  <p>To her amazement, he nodded.</p>

  <p>"No, I do not want you to come again. Your work is not finished, but it
  does not lie here."</p>

  <p>He turned to the little manager, and paralysed him with his next
  announcement.</p>

  <p>"Close this store to-morrow morning; get everything cleared out. I engaged
  you for a month, and I'll give you a month's salary."</p>

  <p>"But what about selling the desks?" stammered the little man.</p>

  <p>Dr. Laffin did not vouchsafe an answer.</p>

  <p>The crowd had dispersed with the drawing of the window shades, and there
  was no person in Duke Street curious enough to glance at her when she came
  out with the doctor. His hired car was waiting a little way up the
  street.</p>

  <p>"I'll go home on top of a bus, Doctor," she said. "I have a headache, and
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're coming home with me, my friend," said Laffin, who hid regained his
  old imperturbability. "I have something to say to you."</p>

  <p>"But I promised I would go to tea with Clive&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're coming home with me. Clive can wait&mdash;if by Clive yon mean
  that impecunious young man, Lord Lowbridge."</p>

  <p>She could not make a scene in the street, and nothing was to be gained by
  further argument. She preceded him into the car, resolved to make the
  forthcoming interview short. One good thing had happened, and she sighed
  thankfully as she remembered that Duke Street and that horrible window would
  know her no more.</p>

  <p>The car drew up before the house in Camden Road; the doctor jumped out and
  offered his hand to her; and at that moment came a horrible sense of danger,
  a premonition of peril beyond her understanding.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I'll go in with you, Doctor," she said. "Can't you get the
  chauffeur to drive us round the park and say what you have to say then? I
  must be home before dinner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will come inside for a few moments no longer. I promise you I will
  not keep you more than five minutes." Fear of making a scene induced her to
  yield. Without a glance to left or right, she followed him through the badly
  fitting gate, and did not so much as notice that there had been one
  interested spectator. Mr. William Holbrook had both seen and heard.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE LOCKED ROOM</h2>

  <p class="first">THE doctor opened the door of his study, and again she
  hesitated. There was no reason in the world why she should fear him any more
  at that moment than she had in the past; but somehow the very atmosphere of
  this house was fearful, and a thrill lurked in every shadow.</p>

  <p>"You will not return to the shop, Elizabeth," were his first words, "and I
  do not doubt that you will be very pleased to know this."</p>

  <p>He motioned her to a chair, and with a lifetime's habit of obedience, she
  sat down.</p>

  <p>"You will remember that a year ago, as a result of the desire expressed by
  you for the privacy which, in this age of prurience and hypocrisy, every
  woman regards as her due, I went to the great expense of creating what was
  virtually a house within a house, a dwelling-place in but not of my own
  home."</p>

  <p>In such magniloquent language did the doctor describe the very simple
  process of fixing a door to the top landing of the house, which gave her the
  floor to herself. The cost had been infinitesimal, and Laffin had disputed
  every item of the carpenters' bill. The "dwelling-place" she had thus
  acquired, had been a bedroom, a bathroom, which had been intended for the
  servants, two other rooms, one of which was empty, and one containing
  sufficient furniture to emphasise its bareness.</p>

  <p>"Your suite is as you left it. I have been at some pains to collect for
  you the linen necessary to your comfort; there is a gas fire and a gas ring,
  at which you may cook"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you, Doctor. You know that I am not returning to the
  house," she interrupted. "I am very comfortable in my own little apartments.
  I thought we had settled that matter definitely?"</p>

  <p>As usual, Laffin made no direct response.</p>

  <p>"Before you reject an offer conceived in the very spirit of charity,
  before you strike at the hand which has fed you and clothed you, which has
  rescued you from the ignominy of a pauper school and the humiliation of
  domestic service, child of infamous parentage, be so good as to inspect my
  work of devotion and kindness, and tell me if I have fallen short in my duty
  to one in whose veins runs the foul blood of a besotted murderer."</p>

  <p>All this in the old mincing, precious way, that clothed the language of
  transpontine drama with a certain serious importance. If he observed Betty's
  impatient sigh, he made no comment, but, rising, took down a key that hung on
  a nail above the fireplace.</p>

  <p>"Oblige me by leading the way," he said, with overelaborate courtesy, and,
  with a shrug of her shoulders, she went before him up the stairs, determined
  that nothing he could say would induce her to remain a minute longer in that
  house than was absolutely necessary.</p>

  <p>Her "suite," as he was pleased to call it, was on the third floor. The
  door at the top of the landing was locked, and, in addition, she saw a staple
  and bolt which seemed to have been newly fixed.</p>

  <p>"Do you padlock this door?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"If you do not return, it shall be padlocked and never opened again."</p>

  <p>"I hope you will also throw away the key," she said coolly, "for these are
  the most dismal rooms in the house."</p>

  <p>There was little change in her apartment; the bed had been made up, a fire
  was laid in the grate, and two or three books were on the table, but</p>

  <p>"When did you have these bars put up?" She pointed to four steel rods that
  barred the window.</p>

  <p>"Quite recently," he said.</p>

  <p>Bedroom and bathroom were at the back of the house, overlooking a
  parallelogram of disorderly gardens. She walked out of the room, intending to
  go into what had been planned as her sitting-room, but the door was
  locked.</p>

  <p>"It is not my intention that you should use the rooms at the front of the
  house," said Dr. Laffin.</p>

  <p>"It is not my intention to use any," she answered with spirit.</p>

  <p>To this he gave no reply, and she was so inured to his bad manners that
  she did not realise that he had passed through the landing-door until she
  heard it slam, and the snap of the lock as it turned.</p>

  <p>"Let me out!" Her fists were Hammering on the panel.</p>

  <p>"You will stay until I am ready for you, my little friend."</p>

  <p>His voice was muffled, and only now she realised the thickness of the
  door. He was fitting a padlock on the new bolt; she heard the grating of iron
  against iron, and then two bolts were shot.</p>

  <p>The first wave of her anger passed, leaving her deadly cool. The little
  warning which her unconscious self had whispered, was something more than an
  unreasonable fear; there was another and a more sinister explanation for
  Joshua Laffin's conduct.</p>

  <p>The door was impossible. She went into the bedroom, opened the window and
  tried to look out. The steel rods were an effective barrier to escape, even
  were it possible to scale the sheer wall that dropped fifty feet to a
  stone-flagged courtyard.</p>

  <p>And then a wild hope surged in her heart, and she sprang up from the bed
  on which she was sitting, and ran to the landing door. She had heard a
  familiar voice below. It was Clive Lowbridge!</p>

  <p>"Clive, Clive!" she called, and hammered with all her might on the door.
  "Clive, help me!"</p>

  <p>She listened; there came the thud of a door, and a dead silence reigned.
  The old man had taken him out of the house.</p>

  <p>To give way to hysterical fear now would be madness, she thought, and
  strove to calm herself. It was not long before she had her reminder that she
  had not eaten since her frugal luncheon, and she went into the little
  kitchenette, where she had so often cooked surreptitious meals in the old
  days, when her sole source of heat supply was one gas burner. At the sight of
  the provisions on the table she grew thoughtful. Dr. Laffin had made such
  preparations that she could not doubt he expected her imprisonment to be a
  long one. There was time enough to consider the future; for the moment her
  need was both urgent and insistent.</p>

  <p>She finished her dinner, washed the plates and strolled back to her room
  to sit down and think...</p>

  <p>As the church bells clanged the tenth hour, Mr. William Holbrook threw
  away the last of his cigarette supply and groaned. She had said in his
  hearing that she would only stay a few minutes. Five hours had passed, and
  the girl had not come out.</p>

  <p>The doctor's house stood on a comer lot, and for the third time in an hour
  he walked along the side street and looked up at the lighted window, and this
  time he was rewarded, for the figure of the girl appeared for a second and
  vanished. And there were bars on the window&mdash;new bars; he had seen them
  by daylight, and had remarked upon their amateurish placing.</p>

  <p>What should he do? Following the departure of the doctor, he had knocked
  at the door, but his knock had gone unheeded. If Dr. Laffin kept servants,
  they were beyond the sound of the summons.</p>

  <p>Again he looked up at the window, and then:</p>

  <p>"Pretty easy house that&mdash;to a professional, I mean," said a voice in
  his ear, and he jerked round, startled.</p>

  <p>Toby Marsh was at his elbow&mdash;even without his thick rubber-soled
  shoes, Toby had the habit of noiseless walking.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; GETTING IN</h2>

  <p class="first">"ONE of the lower orders, by which I mean the common or
  criminal classes, would hesitate to approach a gentleman with the plain and
  straightforward statement that any burglar, who had taken a lesson from a
  correspondence school, would find that house as easy as opening a box of
  matches," said Mr. Marsh. "It is so simple that a specialist, being naturally
  suspicious, would say 'There's a trap.'"</p>

  <p>"Where the devil did you come from?" asked Bill, recovering from his
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"I've been watching you for the last three hours," said Mr. Marsh calmly,
  "and you've been watching the house. There is a certain Latin saying, which I
  haven't got at my finger-tips, about who shall watch the watcher? The answer
  is&mdash;Hubert Francis Marsh&mdash;Toby, for short, though I am averse to
  nicknames."</p>

  <p>Bill's eyes had strayed to the window.</p>

  <p>"Could you get into that room if you wanted?"</p>

  <p>"Could I get into that room if I wanted?" Toby Marsh was amused. "I could
  fall into that room from the street&mdash;if I wanted! The question is, do I
  want? There is another question." He ticked it off on the second of his long,
  delicate fingers. "Why does Laffin fix bars to his window with his own
  hands&mdash;being in such a hurry that he couldn't wait for a workman, but
  bought the iron himself, at Colbord &amp; Willing's in Finsbury Road, and
  darned nearly broke his neck trying to screw 'em in? I ask you again, why?
  And my answer is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A lemon," said the irritated Bill. Suddenly: "I want to talk to that
  young lady. Now, how am I going to do it?"</p>

  <p>"In other words, you want to get into that house. The only suggestion I
  can make to you is that I open the door for you."</p>

  <p>"Could you?" asked Bill, incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything easier?" asked the other, with an air of weariness.
  "Will you resume your post of observation? And have no fear for me; in five
  minutes you will see the door open. Walk right in&mdash;I shall not be there;
  I am discreet. And without discretion, as Jeremy Collier says, people may be
  overlaid with unreasonable affection and choked with too much nourishment.
  The overfeeding of the prisoners in Pentonville jail is a national
  scandal."</p>

  <p>He dismissed his awe-stricken audience with a nod, and Bill went back to
  his vigil and his doubts. One at least was set at rest four minutes after he
  had returned to his post. The front door moved slightly, and, walking across
  the road, he ran up the garden path, entered the hall and closed the door
  behind him. There was no sign of Toby Marsh. True to his promise in every
  respect, he had both opened the door and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Bill did not stop to consider the consequences. He waited only to get his
  bearings, and then he went up the dark stairs, holding a lighted match. Two
  flights he traversed, and then his further progress was held up by a door
  which was heavily padlocked.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" said a voice on the other side.</p>

  <p>"Holbrook," was the answer, and she uttered a cry of thankfulness that
  made the next question unnecessary.</p>

  <p>"Why are you staying here? Has the old man locked you in?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; can you open the door, please?"</p>

  <p>Bill felt at the padlock.</p>

  <p>"I can't open it legitimately, but if you'll wait, I'll go down below and
  see what there is."</p>

  <p>He was halfway down the second flight when, in an alcove, he saw in the
  light of his match a hideous face glaring at him from the gloom. It was a
  squat African idol, and, dropping his match, he lifted it with some
  difficulty to the floor, for it was made of ironwood and was exceptionally
  heavy. Nevertheless, if it could be handled from the precarious foothold of
  the stairs, he guessed it would be sufficient.</p>

  <p>With considerable difficulty he shouldered his heavy burden, and
  reascended the stairs. As he had guessed, he had set himself an almost
  impossible task, for the idol was heavier and more unwieldy than he had
  imagined.</p>

  <p>"Stand away from the door," he said. "I'm going to try to break it in, but
  I'm not sure that I'll be successful."</p>

  <p>Exerting all his strength, he swung back the <i>bête</i>, and brought it
  with a crash against the door at the place where the padlock was fastened.
  Such was the weight of his battering-ram that the hasp snapped, but the door
  stood firm. He waited awhile till he had recovered his breath, and then
  repeated the blow, driving the feet of the idol at a place level with the
  keyhole. To his gratification, the door burst open with a crash, and the
  weight of the wooden figure overbalanced him, so that he fell almost at the
  girl's feet.</p>

  <p>"Is this housebreaking or burglary, I wonder?" he said, as he rolled the
  hideous figure out of sight. "Now, young lady, if you're ready"</p>

  <p>"Hurry, please hurry!" she said.</p>

  <p>They had reached the hall, when they heard a key in the lock.</p>

  <p>"In the study," whispered the girl, and almost dragged him through the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>It was the doctor; she heard and recognised his little affected cough.</p>

  <p>Would he go straight upstairs or make for the study? Invariably he went to
  his room first. Footsteps passed the door, and she listened intently. Was he
  going up the stairs? The stair carpet was so thick that she could not hear,
  but after a while he coughed again, and this time the sound came from above.
  Instantly they were in the passage, and she had opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Who is there!"</p>

  <p>It was Laffin's voice calling them from the first landing.</p>

  <p>Bill swung the front door close after him with a crash, and they raced
  down the path together, turned into Camden Road, and did not slacken pace
  until they saw the shadowy figure of a policeman ahead of them, and deemed it
  expedient not to excite his suspicions.</p>

  <p>"Now where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going back to my lodgings," she said. "I can't tell you how grateful
  I am to you, Mr. Holbrook. But how did you get in?"</p>

  <p>Bill coughed.</p>

  <p>"A friend of mine opened the door. When I say a friend of mine," he
  explained. "I mean that he's a&mdash;er&mdash;a professional door-opener with
  whom I am acquainted. Why did he lock you up? I suppose it was Laffin?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was Dr. Laffin," she said quietly, "but that is all I can tell
  you. His conduct is as much of a mystery to me as it is to you. I only know
  that I was terribly frightened, and that when you came through that door I
  could have fallen on your neck."</p>

  <p>"That wasn't at all necessary," said Bill, and the primness of the reply
  brought her to the verge of hysterical laughter.</p>

  <p>"But why did you come in? How did you know I was there?"</p>

  <p>"I had been watching the house; in fact, I saw you arrive, and heard you
  remark that you would not be longer than five minutes. At the end of five
  hours I began to think that you had changed your mind."</p>

  <p>They walked along in silence for five minutes.</p>

  <p>"You're a queer man," she said. "I think I may have been mistaken in
  you."</p>

  <p>Bill looked at her quickly.</p>

  <p>"Until I know what your first impressions were, I am not able to enlighten
  you," he said.</p>

  <p>"Well, I thought you were bumptious, pushful, and&mdash;rather thick-
  skinned," she said frankly.</p>

  <p>"That's right," nodded Bill, "I'm all those. If you were William K.
  Holbrook you would also be bumptious and self-satisfied."</p>

  <p>"Did you see Lord Lowbridge?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Lord Lowbridge? Is that the Apollo Belvedere person. Yes, he came out at
  the same time as friend Laffin. I'll bet he isn't laffin' now."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"A low jest, which doesn't bear repetition," he said guiltily. "Yes, I saw
  Lord Lowbridge. He's the only lord I've ever seen that looks like one; most
  of the peerage of this country are such miserable devils that I want to pat
  them on the back, and say 'Never mind.' But I can imagine that
  guy&mdash;gentleman, in a suit of armour, chasing dragons and rescuing
  maidens and appropriating other people's castles. Now, Miss Carew," he
  stopped, "I won't go any farther with you, or I shall lose my reputation. No
  man has ever associated my name with a lady, and I don't want any of these
  snooping reporters to go spreading reports in Fleet Street about my
  forthcoming nuptials." She laughed.</p>

  <p>"If I didn't know you were joking, I'd be very angry with you. As it is, I
  can't tell you how grateful I am."</p>

  <p>"Then don't try. You'll be doing your window-dressing act to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said quietly, "that is finished."</p>

  <p>"Finished to-day?" His head was thrust toward her, his voice was eager.
  "Finished this afternoon? Did the old man tell you that? And he pinched you
  to-night&mdash;gosh!" She was a little bewildered.</p>

  <p>"I don't see the connection, but it is a fact that I'm not going to Duke
  Street any more."</p>

  <p>Bill Holbrook was silent. His nimble mind was turning over an accumulated
  experience, seeking for the inevitable parallel.</p>

  <p>"Where are you staying to-night, Miss Carew?" he asked. There was no
  flippancy in his tone now. Bill Holbrook was serious, and was incapable of a
  jest.</p>

  <p>She gave him her address, and he jotted it down on the back of an old
  envelope.</p>

  <p>"You have money, I suppose?" he asked, and, though she smiled, she
  appreciated the thought. "Now, hurry home," he said paternally.</p>

  <p>"Where will you go? You're not going back?" she asked in alarm.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm curious to see what happens."</p>

  <p>He waited until she was gone, and then retraced his footsteps. Evidently
  something remarkable had occurred, for there was a small crowd before the
  gate of Dr. Laffin's house. The front door was open, and in the hall lights
  he saw two policemen talking to a dishevelled Laffin. Pushing through the
  crowd, he made his way up the steps into the hall, and at sight of him the
  old man's brows met.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he demanded sharply.</p>

  <p>"I've just come along to see what was the trouble," said Bill.</p>

  <p>All the habitual calm of Dr. Joshua Laffin had vanished; he was a
  quivering, raging fury.</p>

  <p>"What has happened!" he screamed. "I'll tell you what has happened! Some
  thief has stolen a golden buckle... worth a fortune... the diamond and golden
  buckle of Isis." He was frothing at the mouth.</p>

  <p>Bill's heart nearly stopped beating. Toby Marsh! The obliging burglar had
  not been so disinterested as he thought,</p>

  <p>"You get out!" The doctor yelled the words. "Officer, put that man out; I
  will not have him here. What right have you...?"</p>

  <p>One of the policemen stooped his head significantly, and Bill, who knew
  the way of the blue custodians, went out meekly. He wondered whether he
  should tell Bullott. Fortunately for him, Mr. Bullott was not at home.</p>

  <p>As he approached his house, he saw a man sitting on the doorstep, and his
  figure seemed familiar.</p>

  <p>"Why, Marsh!" he said. "How on earth did you get here?"</p>

  <p>"Walked," was the laconic reply. "Bullott's out. Was there any trouble
  down Camden Road?"</p>

  <p>"I should say there was," said Bill drily. "Marsh, I didn't expect you to
  do that sort of thing. Burglary is a serious offence."</p>

  <p>"So is receiving," said Toby Marsh blandly, "if you're talking about that
  diamond buckle. It's in your right-hand coat pocket, Mr. Holbrook."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE NOVITIATES</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL thrust his hand into his pocket, felt something hard
  and sharp, as his fingers closed over an uneven surface. When he brought his
  hand forth he uttered a cry of amazement and consternation. In his hand was a
  curiously shaped object, almost as big as his palm. It bore no resemblance to
  a buckle, looking more like a large baggage tag, and it was alive with
  flashing fires, where the street lamp caught the diamond-encrusted
  surface.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he gasped. "How did that come there?"</p>

  <p>"I put it there," said Mr. Marsh calmly. "I was in the study, and it
  struck me that, if I walked out and ran into the hands of the coppers, the
  presence of that incriminating evidence in my pocket might lead to disastrous
  results, especially as I only went into the house to do you a turn."</p>

  <p>"You seem to have been doing yourself a little good," said Bill grimly.
  "What would have happened to me if they'd found it in my pocket?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. You're an honest man, and if the worst had come to the worst I
  should have appeared at the local police station, and made a statement,
  exculpating&mdash;remember that word, which is both correct and
  classy&mdash;exculpating you from any complicity. The lower orders would
  describe my action as lunacy, but I not only know that I am an altruist, but
  can pronounce the word. Can I see you in private?"</p>

  <p>Bill hesitated. His duty was to communicate with the nearest police
  station, but to do this might lead to an embarrassing situation for himself,
  and, what was more important, for the girl.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he said curtly, and took the visitor up to his
  sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"Never been in Bullott's house before," said Marsh, eyeing the furnishings
  with a critical and approving eye. "For a man who has been doing office work
  all his life, and has had none of the opportunities for bribery and
  corruption which his brethren have, it is a little remarkable that he's got
  such a nice place. He's a bachelor, of course? If he were married he couldn't
  afford this house. Personally, I prefer the woman's touch; and though Mrs.
  Hamshaw, my respected landlady, lacks the essentials of refinement, she has
  connections with the superior order, and her daughter, being one of the
  wealthy classes, supplies many of her deficiencies."</p>

  <p>"I hate to interrupt your crackajack oration," said Bill quietly, "but,
  Marsh, what are you going to do about this interesting jewel?"</p>

  <p>He had laid it on the table, and in the better light could admire the
  exquisite workmanship of the old Egyptian craftsman who had fashioned the
  lucky buckle of the goddess.</p>

  <p>"It is exactly that matter I want to speak about," said Mr. Marsh. "May I
  smoke?"</p>

  <p>He produced his gold cigarette case with a flourish, and, with another
  flourish, opened it. Bill selected the cigarette he was offered, and waited
  until the case went back to the burglar's pocket.</p>

  <p>"Now my suggestion is, that you take that buckle"&mdash;he spoke very
  slowly and deliberately, punctuating every other word with a puff of
  smoke&mdash;"and you place it in the vaults of your bank. If you have no
  bank, or if, perchance, your bank has no vault, then I suggest you should
  hand it to the Public Trustee."</p>

  <p>Bill frowned at him.</p>

  <p>"When you have finished being comic&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not being comic at all, Mr. Holbrook," said the other innocently. "I
  am merely offering a suggestion as to the best way of safeguarding Miss
  Elizabeth Carew's property."</p>

  <p>"Miss Carew?"</p>

  <p>Toby Marsh nodded.</p>

  <p>"She isn't aware of the fact that it is her property, and at the same time
  Dr. Josh. Laffin isn't aware that I'm aware that it is her property. In fact,
  he believes that nobody in the wide world except himself and one who shall be
  nameless&mdash;forgive my mysteriousness, but that is my vice&mdash;has the
  least knowledge of that buckle's existence. Having settled that matter to
  everybody's satisfaction," he added more briskly, "may I suggest that you, at
  the earliest opportunity, become initiated as a Proud Son of Ragusa?" Bullott
  had come in; Bill heard him moving about alone. "Marsh, do you mind if I
  discuss this matter with Bullott?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I very much mind," was the prompt reply. "Bullott is a policeman, a man
  whose mental qualities have never been completely tested. I appreciate your
  difficulty, Mr. Holbrook, but Bullott isn't going to get you out."</p>

  <p>Bill weighed the buckle in his hand, and then, opening a drawer of his
  desk, locked it away.</p>

  <p>"What did you do with the paper?" asked the amazing burglar. "The paper it
  was wrapped in when I put it in your pocket? I tore it from a book in the
  safe, and I'd like to see it."</p>

  <p>Bill put his hand into his pocket, and felt a crumpled paper, which he
  drew to the light. It was from an old, fine-lined exercise book, and the
  writing was bold and irregular.</p>

  <p>"Money is life. Without money life is misery. We have only one life to
  live&mdash;every second should be consciously enjoyed. This is only possible
  if you have money. Death is untroubled sleep. Life without money is full of
  pain and irritation. There is no excuse for poverty. Aim at millions. A man
  with a million can buy a new conscience. Moral codes are made by monied
  people to keep us poor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is the author of this thoroughly immoral philosophy?" asked Bill, in
  surprise. "It doesn't look like Laffin's writing."</p>

  <p>Mr. Toby Marsh did not often smile, but his face was puckered now in a
  grin of sheer enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"To me it is as clear as the dome of St. Paul's on a sunny day," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Bullott was coming up the stairs, and would presently knock at the
  door.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you don't want to see the inspector? I ask you this because
  he's liable to come up at any minute," said Bill.</p>

  <p>Toby shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I want to dwell in harmony with all men," he said. "If he comes, I shall
  treat him with respect.</p>

  <p>"I've got nothing on Bullott. I'll take that paper, if you don't mind." He
  folded the torn page carefully, and put it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"The question is whether Bullott has anything on you," chuckled Bill, as
  he heard the landlord's knock, and opened the door to him.</p>

  <p>Bullott comprehended the visitor in one glance.</p>

  <p>"Good evening&mdash;brother," he said, and there was such significance in
  the word that Bill looked from one to the other.</p>

  <p>There was a twinkle in Toby Marsh's eye.</p>

  <p>"We're Sons of Ragusa, him and me," he said. "Take my tip, Mr.
  Holbrook&mdash;get in whilst the getting is cheap."</p>

  <p>"You've joined the Sons of Ragusa?"</p>

  <p>"Proud Sons," corrected Mr. Marsh soberly. "Yes, and the inspector joined
  the same night."</p>

  <p>Bill looked from one to the other.</p>

  <p>"But why?" he asked at last. "What is there about the Ragusas that is so
  fascinating that it brings you two boys into the same camp?"</p>

  <p>"The Proud Sons of Ragusa," explained Toby, "started off with more degrees
  than they had members. I believe there were forty in all. But the ritual was
  a little bit too complicated, and the members difficult to handle. To-day
  there are only five. There is the ordinary degree, into which you'll be
  initiated if you're wise; there's the High Degree, which is a sort of
  district lodge; there's the Grand Lodge Degree; there's the Twenty-Third; and
  over and above these, the priors of the order&mdash;they're the real swells,
  who give the law, fix the ritual, distribute the argosies, and administer the
  order from top to bottom. Now, you've got to remember this about the
  Ragusas&mdash;that, when you're clear of the Grand Lodge, you're unknown! The
  Grand Lodge doesn't hold elections and say that this guy or that guy shall be
  a member of the Twenty-Third Degree, or shall be promoted to a prior; the men
  up above just notify the man they want, and automatically he becomes one of
  themselves."</p>

  <p>"But surely," interrupted Bill, "the Grand Lodge miss a familiar
  face?"</p>

  <p>Toby grinned mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"Wait and see about that face stuff," he said. "But you've put your finger
  on the real mystery of the Ragusas. When you're initiated at the little lodge
  in Edgware Road, you may be in the presence of the priors, you may be
  hobnobbing with members of the Twenty-Third Degree, you may be meeting the
  Grand Prior himself and never know it. And the worshipful master of the lodge
  wouldn't know either. The Ragusas accept discipline from above; there are no
  elections outside the lower lodge, which chooses its own officers; and a
  fellow who's been through the chair passes back to the rank and file without
  any further promotion, unless he receives a letter telling him he has been
  appointed to one of the higher degrees, and giving instructions as to where
  he must go and what he must do. If a man kicks, or wants some other way of
  running the society, they throw him out. If he kicks again, they get at him
  in such a way that they can't be traced. He'll lose his job, or his landlord
  will throw him into the street without notice. They've been known to buy a
  house over a man's head in order to get him out of his business. The
  discipline is fine! The kick comes from the Twenty-Third Degree&mdash;and the
  Grand Master of the Twenty-Third Degree is Joshua Laffin, Doctor of
  Medicines!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; BROTHER JOHN</h2>

  <p class="first">BETTY CAREW felt something more than a mental relief in the
  knowledge that her nightmare experience was at an end. She woke from a deep,
  refreshing sleep, and it was significant that her first thought was one of
  heartfelt gratitude that she had not to appear in that horrible shop window.
  Later came the memory of her unpleasant experience at the hands of her
  guardian, to be briefly considered and dismissed.</p>

  <p>She was so inured to the eccentricities of Dr. Laffin that, beyond
  speculating as to his purpose, she was not greatly perturbed by his attempt
  to hold her a prisoner in that gloomy house. He was different from other men;
  his methods, his standard of behaviour, his principles, did not attune with
  those of normal humanity. For a very long time he had been urging her to
  return to Camden Road, and she supposed that his latest exploit was merely a
  sequel to wishes that she had so persistently flouted.</p>

  <p>She had hardly finished her breakfast before her landlady came into the
  dining-room and announced a visitor.</p>

  <p>Clive! She looked at the clock; it was half-past nine. Then he must have
  heard what had happened.</p>

  <p>One glance at his face confirmed this opinion.</p>

  <p>"I've just come from that old devil," he said vigorously, "and I don't
  think he'll forget my visit! The brute! If I'd only guessed what he had done
  I thought it was strange that he hurried me out of the house so quickly." She
  arrested an explosive view of the doctor's conduct with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"But why did he do it?" insisted Clive, his brow wrinkled in perplexity.
  "He grows more and more incomprehensible every day."</p>

  <p>"I hope you haven't quarrelled with him?" she smiled. "You cannot judge
  him by normal standards."</p>

  <p>"Maybe one of these days he will be judged by standards that will be too
  normal for his health," said Clive Lowbridge. "Betty, it terrifies me to
  think that this man could have been so outrageous. You're not going back to
  the shop again? I came to insist upon that."</p>

  <p>"I am not going back, anyway," she said. "The doctor has finished with me
  as a show-girl. Apparently, having made me a public exhibition, he desired to
  keep me for private view!"</p>

  <p>At his request she told him what had happened since she left Duke Street,
  and gave him a brief account of the rescue.</p>

  <p>"Holbrook?" he said thoughtfully. "That is our advertising gentleman. He
  doesn't seem to be so objectionable as I thought. I owe him one for that.
  Where is he to be found?" She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"He not only did not give me his address, but he was most chary of being
  seen in public with me," she said whimsically. "Poor man! I fear he thought I
  had matrimonial designs&mdash;he really is funny, Clive."</p>

  <p>"I should say he was," said the indignant Clive. "Matrimonial designs
  indeed! He couldn't even help you without being offensive. What are you going
  to do, Betty?"</p>

  <p>She told him of such plans as she had formed. She was seeing De Fell, the
  theatrical manager, that day, and hoped to get a part in his new play. He
  agreed, but with no enthusiasm. He was leaving, when a thought occurred to
  him.</p>

  <p>"By the way, I don't think I should tell anybody else about Holbrook. You
  know that the doctor claims he lost a very valuable buckle&mdash;worth a
  fortune apparently?"</p>

  <p>"Not the buckle of Isis?" she said in amazement.</p>

  <p>"You knew about it, did you?" he asked quickly. "Yes, that is the thing
  which has been lost. Apparently the old man has had it for some time, and the
  loss is a very considerable one to him."</p>

  <p>"But when was it stolen?"</p>

  <p>"Last night. He went into his study, found his safe open and the buckle
  gone. That is the second burglary he has had in a week. Obviously, if
  Holbrook was on the premises, he would be suspected."</p>

  <p>"Then whoever suspected him would be wrong," she said promptly. "Mr.
  Holbrook did not know where the study was until I pushed him in to hide from
  Dr. Laffin. He may be many things, but he is not a burglar."</p>

  <p>He thought a while.</p>

  <p>"Then how on earth did he get into the house?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>It was a question she had asked herself, for she knew something of the
  precautions which Laffin had taken to avoid a repetition of a previous
  visitation.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, she had not much time to think about things that morning. She
  telephoned to De Fell at his house, and was given an appointment, and at
  half-past eleven she was on the deserted stage at the Pallodrome Theatre,
  waiting an opportunity to speak to the busy young man, who was deep in
  conversation with a good-looking, white-haired man, oblivious to the
  rehearsal which was proceeding, and which involved a considerable amount of
  noise and movement, for the producer was licking his "pony" chorus into
  shape. Presently he saw her, lifted his hat and smiled, and beckoned her
  across to him.</p>

  <p>De Fell was a young American who had taken London by storm with the beauty
  of his productions.</p>

  <p>"This is one of the most promising of our younger actresses," he said, to
  her surprise and pleasure. "Meet Miss Carew. Mr. Stone is an American, who
  has nothing to do with the theatrical business, Miss Carew. Also he is a
  confirmed bachelor, one of the richest men in California, and a very good
  friend of mine."</p>

  <p>Betty took the proffered hand with a little smile. De Fell's "biographical
  introductions" were famous; it was said that he could not introduce a stage
  hand without supplying historical details.</p>

  <p>"You're not even interested in this production, Mr. Stone?" said Betty, a
  little awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"No, Miss Carew." Lambert Stone shook his head. "This world is one apart.
  And, frankly, its only merit in my eyes is its association with De Fell."</p>

  <p>He was looking at her with quiet admiration.</p>

  <p>"That is bad news for a fortune-hunting actress," she said with mock
  solemnity. "'Confirmed bachelor' is a challenge to every self-respecting
  woman!"</p>

  <p>He laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think so," he said. "I was confirmed in my bachelordom many
  years ago, but if I were shaken at all from my fixed determination to go
  through life without adding to the natural miseries of any woman, now would
  be the moment."</p>

  <p>They both laughed together, and for the time being Betty was so absorbed
  in the personality of her new acquaintance that she forgot her errand. It was
  De Fell who reminded her.</p>

  <p>"I hope you haven't come for that part, Miss Carew?" he said. "I kept it
  open until last Saturday, but now it is filled."</p>

  <p>Seeing her crestfallen face, he asked quickly:</p>

  <p>"Is it a matter of vital importance to you?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said, with a smile, "if you mean, am I without money!"</p>

  <p>"I'm opening in eight weeks' time at the Grand," he said. "If you can last
  till then, I will give you a really good part." The news was disappointing,
  but in a way she was glad. She had worked without a break for seven
  months&mdash;she had come into <i>The Girl from Fez</i> from a road
  tour&mdash;and the month of idleness was welcome. On her way home she decided
  to call at the Orpheum to collect a few of her belongings. Happily, the
  theatre was empty, the rehearsals for the new play not having started, and
  she packed her bag at her leisure, and carried it downstairs to the little
  hall where the stage doorkeeper kept his vigil.</p>

  <p>"I forgot to tell you, Miss," said the janitor, "there's been a man here
  making inquiries about you."</p>

  <p>It was no new experience for strangers to "make inquiries" about
  actresses, and she had had in full the experience, which comes to every girl
  on the stage, of being pestered by unknown admirers.</p>

  <p>"He wanted to know where you lived, but, of course, I couldn't tell him
  that. And then he asked me if you were any relation to Dr. Laffin."</p>

  <p>This was surprising, for her association with Dr. Laffin was not generally
  known in the theatrical world.</p>

  <p>"Who was he, Jones?"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Miss, but he's a very nice-spoken gentleman&mdash;a
  clergyman; at least, he looks like a clergyman," he added cautiously.</p>

  <p>He went out to find a taxi for her, and returned with news.</p>

  <p>"He's waiting on the other side of the road, Miss. Do you want to see
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;the clergyman?" she asked, startled. "Let me see him."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; A SHOT IN THE STREET</h2>

  <p class="first">SHE went to the door and looked out. Walking slowly along
  the opposite sidewalk was a short, stout man, with a long black beard. If he
  were not a clergyman, the janitor's mistake was pardonable, for his clothes
  were of the severest black, and on his head was a low-crowned hat such as
  ministers wear. She thought a moment, then:</p>

  <p>"Will you ask him to come over, Jones?" she said.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later the stage doorkeeper returned, ushering in the bearded
  stranger. His hat was off now, and his tonsured head lent support to the view
  Jones had taken of his calling.</p>

  <p>"Are you Miss Carew?" he asked. His voice was very gentle and soft, and
  there was a kindliness in his brown eyes which was very likeable.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm Miss Carew. You wished to see me?"</p>

  <p>His voice was strangely familiar. She had heard it before somewhere, but,
  racking her brains, she could not recall a meeting.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I wished to see you." He hesitated. "My name is&mdash;" again he
  paused&mdash;"Brother John. At least, I'm called Brother John by my
  friends."</p>

  <p>He had the slightest trace of an American accent, she thought. And she
  knew him! She was certain they had met somewhere, but for the life of her she
  could not remember.</p>

  <p>The janitor had discreetly retired to his box.</p>

  <p>"You are Dr. Laffin's ward, are you not?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you are an actress, too, Miss Carew?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am an actress," she said, wondering what was coming next.</p>

  <p>"Am I wrong in believing that you were the lady who appeared as lately as
  yesterday in the window of a store on Duke Street?"</p>

  <p>He spoke very slowly, seemed to be measuring every word before he gave it
  expression.</p>

  <p>Betty flushed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am that unfortunate individual," she said, with a little smile. "I
  hope you haven't come to buy a desk?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, Miss Carew, I have come on no such mission; but I would like to ask
  you, if it is permissible&mdash;and I realise that I may be going beyond the
  bounds of pertinence&mdash;why you undertook that extraordinary work?"</p>

  <p>Her first inclination was to return a discouraging reply, but there was
  such a queer anxiety in his face that she changed her mind.</p>

  <p>"I went there at the request of Dr. Laffin," sue said.</p>

  <p>"Did Dr. Laffin take you into his confidence?" he asked. And then,
  hastily: "I mean, do you know why you were so employed?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't the slightest idea," she answered shortly. "The only thing I am
  certain about is, that in no circumstances would I again endure such misery
  as I suffered during the very short time I was on exhibition."</p>

  <p>He bit his lip, his eyes never leaving her face.</p>

  <p>"Was there... was it part of your duties to give a message to somebody who
  called?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation she nodded.</p>

  <p>"I fear you think that I am an impertinent man," said Brother John, "but
  this matter touches me very nearly, and involves the peace and happiness of
  one for whom I have a very deep affection, and I am sure that, when you
  realise this, you will forgive what may seem the unpardonable liberty I am
  taking."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will tell me something?" she replied. "What was in Dr.
  Laffin's mind when he asked me to undertake that work?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I can't tell you that," he said.</p>

  <p>And then:</p>

  <p>"You are a priest, aren't you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"No, Madam, I am not a priest. I was an ordained priest of the Episcopal
  Church, but I was&mdash;unfrocked, for holding views which met with the
  disapproval of my bishop."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand, and she took it.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad that you knew nothing," he said simply, and before she
  could frame another question he was gone.</p>

  <p>When she came out into the street she saw his broad shoulders vanish round
  the corner of the block. The mystery of the desk-selling proposition had
  become so intensified, that to think about it any more was sheer madness. So
  she was telling herself, when a voice hailed her, and she turned to meet Mr.
  William Holbrook, miraculously tidy and presentable, and somewhat out of
  breath.</p>

  <p>"I have been chasing you along from De Fell's," he said. "I wanted to see
  you before that old doctor man starts asking you questions."</p>

  <p>"About the burglary?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>Bill's face fell.</p>

  <p>"You've seen him, then?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen him," she smiled, "but I've seen Lord Lowbridge, and he
  told me what had happened. Of course, it is too ridiculous for words! You
  hadn't an opportunity."</p>

  <p>"Did you mention the fact that I was in the house?" he asked anxiously,
  and, when she told him she had, he whistled.</p>

  <p>"I can see myself getting pinched," he said, "and that is certainly tough
  on me."</p>

  <p>She interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Holbrook," she said, acting on a sudden impulse, "have you any idea
  why I was put into that wretched window to sell desks?" And, before he could
  answer, she told him of the interview she had just had with Brother John.</p>

  <p>Bill listened, and scratched his head with a puzzled expression.</p>

  <p>"That is a new one," he said. "But just tell me about that message?"</p>

  <p>She wished now that she had not taken him into her confidence, but it was
  futile to leave half the story untold, and briefly she described the
  mysterious individual in sandals and cassock, who had come from the crowd,
  and who had received a very commonplace letter with such marks of
  reverence.</p>

  <p>"And I'm sure I know Brother John. I've heard his voice before, but,
  however hard I try, I cannot place him."</p>

  <p>Bill Holbrook thought quickly. The new complication disturbed more than
  one of his pet theories.</p>

  <p>"Which way did Brother John go?" he asked, and, when she indicated the
  direction: "Do you mind if I walk with you?"</p>

  <p>"I can survive the contamination of your company if you can survive mine,"
  said Betty drily. "Unless my memory is at fault, you objected to my
  compromising society last night."</p>

  <p>"I was known in that neighbourhood," said Bill, unabashed. "Here I am a
  comparative stranger. Gee! I'd like to lay hands on that bearded padre. There
  <i>is</i> a big story in this stunt of the doctor's. I always thought there
  was."</p>

  <p>He was so interested in the new development that he forgot the
  consequences which might come to him from the revelation that he was the man
  in Laffin's house when the diamond buckle was stolen.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to get this story right," he went on, and stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>Ahead of him a small crowd had congregated on the sidewalk. Over the heads
  of the people he saw the helmets of two policemen.</p>

  <p>"Just one moment," he said, and ran on ahead of her.</p>

  <p>Pushing his way through the crowd, he came to a clear space, where a man
  lay on his back, his arms outstretched, a look of peace upon his white
  face.</p>

  <p>"Shot!" said an excited voice in his ear. "Shot dead... and in the street,
  too! Just a <i>plop!</i> Shot fired from a car... used a silencer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>One glance he gave, and then, elbowing back to the girl, he caught her by
  the arm, and dragged her back to the space in the centre where the dead man
  lay.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" he asked softly.</p>

  <p>She looked and screamed. It was Brother Johnl!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE MAN IN CHARGE</h2>

  <p class="first">"DO you know this man, Miss?" One of the policemen was
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;no," she stammered. "I saw him a few minutes ago. He came to
  the stage door of the Orpheum to see me, but I had never met him before. Is
  he&mdash;is he dead?"</p>

  <p>The officer looked down at the figure.</p>

  <p>"I think so, Miss&mdash;the doctor will be here in a moment. Do you mind
  giving me your name and address?"</p>

  <p>Betty, obeyed like one in a dream, and then, when the officer's
  interrogation was finished, Bill Holbrook's hand tightened about her arm, and
  he led her out of sight of the pitiable object that lay so silent upon the
  sidewalk. Bill's face was tense, his eyes bright.</p>

  <p>"I told you so, I told you so!" he almost croaked. "They shot him down as
  he was walking away from you! They must have been watching him all the
  time."</p>

  <p>"But who&mdash;who?" she asked, bewildered.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you that one day, and it's a day that is not very far ahead,
  Betty Carew."</p>

  <p>He whistled a taxi, bundled her in, and joined her, after giving
  directions which revealed to her, though she was too numbed to be astonished,
  that he knew where she lived, and he left her at the door of her
  lodgings.</p>

  <p>"You'll stay in your house until I come for you, and you won't move out
  otherwise. You can take that as an order, a prayer or a polite request,
  whichever you like best."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said meekly, beyond resentment at his peremptory manner.</p>

  <p>"There's going to be trouble&mdash;a whole lot&mdash;for somebody, and I
  don't want you to be in it." He was speaking rapidly. "When the police come
  to question you, you're to tell them that Brother John called to ask you to
  take part in some charity entertainment&mdash;you understand?"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"Don't 'but'," he said savagely. "Do as I tell you. You've got to keep out
  of this, and you'll only keep out if you can lie a little. Will you promise
  me?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, incapable of speech.</p>

  <p>Holbrook's first act, after leaving the girl, was to make his way to the
  nearest telephone booth, and to call Bullott's house. The inspector, who had
  never made an arrest, must be in this case by hook or by crook. Bullott was
  out, his housekeeper told him.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you'll find him at the Welcome Club."</p>

  <p>Bill tried the Welcome Club, a little rendezvous less than a mile from the
  scene of the murder, and, to his amazement it was Bullott who answered his
  call.</p>

  <p>"Get down to Horsham Street as quickly as you can. There's been a murder
  committed there," said Bill rapidly, "a real daylight shooting&mdash;your
  chance! I'll wait for you at the corner of the street; be there in a quarter
  of an hour. In the meantime, I'm going along to see the police in charge of
  the case, and to bluff them that you're already on it. Do you hear?" he asked
  impatiently, when Bullott did not reply.</p>

  <p>"I'll be there," said Bullott's voice, and there was a click.</p>

  <p>By the time he got back to the street where the murder was committed the
  body had been moved and the street wore its normal appearance. He made an
  inquiry of the first constable he met, and then hurried on to the hospital
  where the mortal remains of Brother John had been taken. As he ran up the
  steps, an inspector of police came out. He was known to Bill Holbrook, and
  his cheery greeting encouraged him in his purpose.</p>

  <p>"Are you after that street murder?" he asked. "If you are, I'm not in the
  case. I've just telephoned the Yard, and the Chief tells me he is sending a
  man down."</p>

  <p>"You can telephone up and tell them that the man is here on the spot,"
  said Bill rapidly. "Inspector Bullott has already begun his
  investigations."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean Bullott, of the Record Department?"</p>

  <p>"That's the guy I'm advertising&mdash;the greatest sleuth we've had on the
  Thames Embankment in years," said Bill glibly. "He practically saw the murder
  committed, and went after the car. You'll save a whole lot of trouble,
  Staines, if you tip off headquarters that he's on the spot." The inspector
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether I can do that on your authority&mdash;" he
  began.</p>

  <p>"If you don't do it now, you'll have no chance of avoiding trouble," said
  Bill urgently. "You can't have two men in charge of the case, and you know
  what the Yard people are&mdash;as jealous as cats&mdash;and you'll be the
  goat."</p>

  <p>Reluctantly the inspector went back to the telephone, and, to his relief,
  learnt that the officer who was to have been put in charge of the case had
  not yet been notified. He was more surprised when he learnt that, with
  extraordinary promptitude, the Chief accepted the presence of Bullott as a
  normal circumstance.</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later, Bill, standing at the corner of Horsham
  Street, saw a taxi drive up, and Bullott jumped out to greet him.</p>

  <p>"I've founded your reputation, Bullott," said the reporter breathlessly.
  "You're in charge of this street murder case. Now, remember this: you've been
  here ever since the shot was fired, and if you haven't got the number of the
  car, why, you ought to have!"</p>

  <p>"The number of the car," said Bullott, calmly, "was XQ.9743, and it will
  interest you to know that I not only saw the car, but I saw the shot fired,
  and if a traffic cop hadn't held me at Holborn, I'd have had the murderer
  under lock and key at this very minute."</p>

  <p>Bill looked at him and gasped.</p>

  <p>"You saw the murder?" said Bill, incredulously. "You're not pulling one on
  me?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm telling the truth. I saw the car&mdash;a big
  limousine&mdash;though I didn't notice the parson until he was down. In fact,
  the shot was fired, and the man had fallen before I guessed what had
  happened. It was then that I sprinted after the machine, saw its number, and
  jumping on the first taxi I overtook, chased it as far as Holborn. Here,
  there was a block, and the car managed to get through just before the east
  and west traffic was released by the traffic cop. It is a hired machine from
  Stanbury's, of Notting Hill, and the driver has already reported. He says he
  dropped his fare near the new Bush Building; doesn't know him from a crow;
  hasn't any idea of his name, his address or his business. What is certain is
  that the car was specially engaged to shadow the priest. It was ordered by
  telephone, and the fare was picked up in Trafalgar Square&mdash;a tall man
  with a long black moustache and horn-rimmed glasses&mdash;the chauffeur
  thinks that he was an American. The chauffeur found the empty case of an
  automatic shell between the matting and the floor of the car&mdash;we've
  something to go on, but lordy! I'm scared, Holbrook! If I'd only overtaken
  that machine, in the heat of the moment, I guess I could have arrested the
  fellow without any qualms. But now...!" His panic was not apparent to the
  officials who assisted him in a search of the body. No papers of any kind
  were discovered; beyond a little money and a worn copy of <i>Spiritual
  Reflections</i>, bearing on the flyleaf the words "To John, from his mother,"
  and dated 1883, there was nothing to identify the murdered man.</p>

  <p>After the examination he joined Bill, who had been waiting patiently
  outside the hospital, and told him the result of the search.</p>

  <p>The young man thought it was a propitious moment to tell him of the
  strange interview that Betty had had that morning with the bearded man.</p>

  <p>"This hasn't got to go into your report, Bullott, because I wish that
  young woman's name kept out of the newspapers. And what she has to tell will
  not help any."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bullott was filling his pipe, and his mild eyes fixed upon his
  lodger.</p>

  <p>"What's she to you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Bill Holbrook was annoyed to the point of incoherence.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; THE INITIATION</h2>

  <p class="first">LODGE No. 1107 of the Proud Sons of Ragusa was housed in a
  hall that had been an unsuccessful cinema theatre, and, having been purchased
  by the Proud Sons, had, at no inconsiderable cost, been converted to the use
  of the order.</p>

  <p>As in the case of most Ragusa lodges, the outer lobby was fitted up as a
  reception office. In many ways it resembled the lobby of a small hotel, with
  its desks at which, under shaded lights, three men sat writing when Bill
  Holbrook arrived that evening. The whole proceedings were most businesslike,
  he thought, as he sat down to read and fill in the blank that was given
  him.</p>

  <p>It was a most innocuous document, in which he had to write his name,
  address and profession, and to sign a declaration that he would abide by the
  rules of the Order, and agreed to accept dismissal from its membership if he
  transgressed the governing laws.</p>

  <p>"That will cost you two pounds," said the official briskly, when he
  returned the blank, "one pound half-yearly subscription and one pound for
  your robe. Your number is H.74&mdash;remember to tell the worshipful keeper
  of the robes that. Now, sir, if you will knock at that door, two of the
  brethren will prepare you for the initiation&mdash;yours is the only one
  to-night."</p>

  <p>At the far end of the vestibule was a double door of polished wood, and on
  this Holbrook knocked. The doors opened instantly, and for a second he was so
  startled by what he saw that he made no move. Two men were standing in the
  inner hall, which was in darkness except for two lamps hanging from the
  ceiling, which gave so faint a light that they only served to emphasise the
  gloom. The men were dressed from head to foot in black; their heads were
  covered by cowls, and over each face was a loose black covering. Only the
  eyes showed through long slits.</p>

  <p>"Enter, Brother-to-be," said one in a shrill, Cockney voice, and the door
  closed behind him.</p>

  <p>The man who had spoken was carrying something over his arm.</p>

  <p>"Put this on," he said, and Bill saw that it was a robe similar to those
  they wore.</p>

  <p>In a minute he was covered, the cowl drawn over his head, and the eye
  apertures adjusted.</p>

  <p>"Speak now, stranger, on the threshold of our mysteries: by land and
  water, by the air and the spaces beneath the earth, do you seek the
  brotherhood of our noble order with a pure heart and a desire to serve
  humanity? Answer 'I do.'"</p>

  <p>The second man gabbled the question mechanically.</p>

  <p>"I do," said Bill.</p>

  <p>The man struck three times upon an inner door, and it was opened.</p>

  <p>"Who comes?" asked a deep voice.</p>

  <p>"A strange mariner for our argosies," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Enter, Son-to-be," said the voice.</p>

  <p>The big hall into which Bill walked between his guardians was as dimly
  illuminated as the outer room. Ranged round the walls on chairs he saw line
  after line of cowled figures. At one end of the room was a raised dais, where
  three figures sat behind a table. Facing them, and at the opposite end of the
  room, sat a solitary man. Except for the robes and the cowls, Holbrook had
  anticipated the layout of the lodge. On the table before the three was a
  small silver ship of ancient design. It evidently stood upon a sheet of glass
  beneath which was a concealed light, for its sails glittered brilliantly.</p>

  <p>Bill was led to the solitary figure, and there began the initiation
  service. He was charged to be a true Son of Ragusa, "fearless in danger, keen
  in enterprise, thrifty in prosperity," and, prompted by his conductors, he
  made the conventional replies. From the Captain of the Lodge, as he
  discovered this officer to be, he was taken to the three, and there received
  what was obviously the key instruction&mdash;the order of obedience. At last
  it was over, and he was shown to a chair that had been left vacant on one
  side of the hall, and became thereafter an interested audience to the
  discussion of lodge business. Who were his right or left hand neighbours, he
  could not guess.</p>

  <p>The discussion that followed bored him; an exchange between the chair and
  one of the orators of the lodge on what was and what was not true
  philanthropy. The arguments were feeble, the speeches poor in the extreme,
  and he was relieved when, rising in his place, the Captain of the Lodge
  lifted his hands in benediction, and chanted:</p>

  <p>"To all Proud Sons of Ragusa, to all officers of lodges, to the noble
  members of the High Degree, to the exalted brethren of the Grand Lodge, to
  the most reverend and puissant Priors, and to the most exalted, noble and
  holy Grand Prior, dedicate we our lives and faiths, our hopes and
  services."</p>

  <p>There was no mention of the Twenty-Third Degree, Bill noticed, and
  wondered what was the explanation for so notable an omission.</p>

  <p>The members filed out in silence, not the way by which he had come, but to
  a disrobing room. This was in complete darkness. As every man stepped into
  the little lobby, he slipped off his coat and cowl and handed it to some
  hidden person, giving his number. The process was a slow one, because there
  was an interval of a few seconds between each member's disappearance, and
  Bill guessed that this method was employed to maintain the illusion of
  secrecy, though the members of the order must have been well known to one
  another, since they met, unmasked and unrobed, in public.</p>

  <p>He took his place at the end of the slow-moving queue, and had nearly
  reached the door, when somebody tapped him on the shoulder, and he turned to
  look into a cowled face.</p>

  <p>"In the name of the Prior," said the figure in a low voice. "The Grand
  Lodge has need of you. You will be at the third milestone on the Epping Road
  at eleven o'clock on Sunday night."</p>

  <p>He pressed a paper into the hand of the astonished reporter, and without
  another word walked swiftly past the waiting queue into the dark room.</p>

  <p>When Bill came out through the side entrance of the lodge, he found Toby
  Marsh pacing the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of it&mdash;brother?"</p>

  <p>"I have attended hangings that have been more cheerful," said Bill.</p>

  <p>Toby chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Hear anything about the Twenty-Third Degree?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, it was not mentioned. Why is that?"</p>

  <p>Again the burglar laughed.</p>

  <p>"The Twenty-Third is <i>tabu</i> amongst the Sons&mdash;it is the
  punishing degree, and is never mentioned. And yet there were at least two men
  there to-night who were Twenty-Thirders until last week&mdash;fired,
  boy!"</p>

  <p>"Fired?"</p>

  <p>"Reduced from the Twenty-Third to the First. That's the way of the
  Ragusas; you never know whether you're up or whether you're down."</p>

  <p>"My own promotion has been so rapid that I'm dizzy," said Bill, and told
  him of his appointment to the Grand Lodge.</p>

  <p>Toby's face was serious.</p>

  <p>"That's quick!" he said. "Where are they to pick you up?"</p>

  <p>"At the third milestone on the Epping Road, wherever that may be," said
  Bill, "but probably there are more instructions here."</p>

  <p>He stopped under a street-lamp, and unrolled the little scrap of paper he
  still held in his hand. He looked and uttered an exclamation. The paper was a
  banknote for a hundred pounds!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; JENNY HAMSHAW</h2>

  <p class="first">"NOBODY knows anything. Who are the members of the Grand
  Lodge, where it holds its meetings, who are the Twenty-Thirders, and why. The
  only thing the poor simps are sure about is that twice a year there is money
  for nothing for somebody. And for the rest, they're satisfied to go on
  gripping and passwording and secret-signing, and singing their silly songs,
  and rooting for their silly lodges," said Toby Marsh, lolling at ease in the
  only comfortable chair that Bill possessed.</p>

  <p>"Who does know?" asked Inspector Bullott, taking his pipe from his
  mouth.</p>

  <p>"The Grand Prior, and nobody else," said Toby promptly. "I've been into
  this because I thought it was good graft. I've nosed and I've pried, and I've
  brought the Sons of Ragusa down to the Book of the Law."</p>

  <p>"What the devil is the Book of the Law?" asked the astonished police
  officer.</p>

  <p>"It's a book that has the ritual and system of the Ragusas written down to
  the last dot. The Grand Prior wrote it, and the Grand Prior has it. When the
  Grand Prior dies, it will be handed over to the new Grand Prior. That is the
  story I've heard, and it sounds true."</p>

  <p>"Is there any graft in it at all?" asked Bill.</p>

  <p>Toby Marsh shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No; that is the surprising thing about the Ragusas. It's an
  honest-to-heaven society; does a whole lot of good, builds cottage hospitals
  for seamen, donates lifeboats&mdash;most of its lodges are in maritime towns,
  and, I suppose, a third of its membership is made up of sailors&mdash;it runs
  an orphanage at Newcastle, and a home for old sailors at Gosport. They're
  certainly tough with members who get fresh or who defy their rules, but so
  far as I know, even in this they have never broken a law. There have been no
  whippings or burnings, and I haven't been able to trace an old Ragusa that
  has been ridden out of town on a rail. Oh yes, they're all right, only...."
  he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Only what?" asked Bill.</p>

  <p>"Only I don't understand old man Laffin being chief of the Twenty-Third
  Degree. That isn't right to me."</p>

  <p>Inspector Bullott was thoughtfully puffing at his pipe.</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking over this murder," he said. "Does it strike you that
  Brother John may have offended the Ragusas?"</p>

  <p>Toby Marsh did not scoff at the idea, as Bill expected.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said, rising; "it's a queer... 'Scuse me, folks, I've
  got an appointment on the right side of the law. Know Jenny Hamshaw? You've
  missed sump'n...!"</p>

  <p>There were two subjects very dear to the heart of Mrs. Caroline Hamshaw.
  The first of these, the super-excellent qualities of heart and brain in her
  only child; the second, Murder as a Fine Art.</p>

  <p>When she was not extolling the virtues of her daughter and her social
  triumphs, her generosity, her sweetness of disposition and her amazing
  exclusiveness, she was supplying her audience with details of crimes which
  had evidently been objects of intensive study. The story of Mrs. Dyer and the
  hundred babies she did to death; the cunning of Smith, the artist, who
  drowned his wives in their baths, having first insured their lives for
  respectable sums; the cold-bloodedness of Deeming, a famous cutter of throats
  who buried his victims under cement: Mrs. Hamshaw knew them all, and spoke of
  them with a certain melancholy pride, as though they owed not a little of
  their notoriety to the fact that she had taken upon herself the burden of
  keeping their memories alive.</p>

  <p>It had been Mrs. Hamshaw's fortune as a girl to give evidence in a
  veritable murder trial, and this experience was probably responsible for the
  interest she took in crime thereafter.</p>

  <p>She had one paying guest, to the presence of whom her high-class daughter
  offered no objection; for, despite her mother's encomiums, Miss Hamshaw was
  by nature mean, and had exact ideas about the value of money, and Mr. Toby
  Marsh paid regularly and never grumbled about extras.</p>

  <p>Miss Hamshaw's rigid view on economy was, if the truth be told, the
  skeleton in her mother's cupboard, and on the evening Bill Holbrook was
  initiated into the full membership of the Proud Sons of Ragusa, the elder
  lady, a stout, morose woman with a strong facial resemblance to the late
  Queen Victoria, sat with her plump hands folded and a tear trickling down her
  large nose, listening with proper humility to the admonitions of her
  child.</p>

  <p>"I'm not made of money, Mother; and really, I think I'm doing enough for
  you. I've given you this house&mdash;at least, I let you live rent
  free&mdash;and I've spent hundreds on furniture, <i>and</i> I'm allowing you
  three pounds a week."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hamshaw murmured something about the high cost of living, and was
  snapped to silence.</p>

  <p>"I haven't had an engagement this past six months&mdash;where do you think
  I get the money from? Why don't you get another boarder? I suppose, because
  you see 'La Florette' in big letters on the billboards, you think I'm a
  millionaire&mdash;but salaries are not what they were, and what with my flat
  and my car and what not, I have a struggle to make both ends meet."</p>

  <p>Thus, La Florette, the thin-faced dancer (Betty had not been far wrong
  when she guessed she was English, for in real life she was plain Jenny
  Hamshaw).</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I do my best to make the money go round," said Mrs. Hamshaw
  gloomily. "There are times when I wonder whether I wouldn't be better off if
  I was dead and in my grave."</p>

  <p>To which suggestion Florette made no very helpful reply. "Mr. Marsh
  wouldn't like another boarder," the old woman went on, "and I don't know that
  I could be bothered. I'm not so young as I was. When I was a girl in Bath
  working for the Carens&mdash;him that murdered his wife, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't give us any horrors," begged Florette, well acquainted with her
  mother's weakness. "I know all about Caren."</p>

  <p>"The child went to the workhouse, and a doctor adopted
  her&mdash;Dr.&mdash;now, what was his name? He called her Carew&mdash;Laffin,
  that was it!&mdash;What's wrong, my love?"</p>

  <p>La Florette was staring at her mother.</p>

  <p>"Carew&mdash;what was her first name?"</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth; a pretty little thing with red hair. It's a funny thing about
  her, that she wasn't Caren's child at all. I knew everything about
  it...."</p>

  <p>The girl was listening, open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"A middle-aged man, Mr. Leiff Something&mdash;I remember the 'Leiff'
  because it was unusual. He married a young girl, and left her with the
  Carens, when he went back to America he was American. He got ill and couldn't
  come back, and a week after the baby was born her mother died. Mrs. Caren
  never had a child, and she got so fond of the little mite that, when Mr.
  Leiff... Stone! That's the name! When he cabled to ask what had happened,
  Mrs. Caren said that they were both dead, mother and child. She used to cry
  about the lie she told, and robbing the baby out of a good home. Mr. Leiff
  What's-his-name... Stone, that's it... well, he was rich&mdash;they say the
  news turned him crazy"</p>

  <p>La Florette, started up, her eyes blazing.</p>

  <p>"Mother, you're not to tell this to anybody in the world, do you hear?
  Betty Carew has got to stay the daughter of a murderer, and that's what
  everybody has got to know."</p>

  <p>A gentle cough behind her made her turn her head.</p>

  <p>Mr. Toby Marsh, hat in hand, stood in the doorway, an apologetic smile on
  his face.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; DR. LAFFIN'S OFFER</h2>

  <p class="first">"I HOPE," said Mr. Marsh, unconsciously paraphrasing the
  remarks of a great literary character, "I hope I don't intrude?"</p>

  <p>There was an awkward silence.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Mr. Marsh," said La Florette, reacting instantly to the admiring
  glance of the newcomer. "My mater and I were having a little pow-wow."</p>

  <p>"If it's a family conference&mdash;" began Toby, with gentlemanly
  delicacy.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;come in. Mother and I were discussing ways and means. You'll
  quite understand my position; naturally I don't wish mater to take boarders,
  not ordinary boarders; I shouldn't like people in my set to know that she
  took boarders at all."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," murmured the lodger.</p>

  <p>"But this is what they call in the newspapers the age of&mdash;what is the
  word? It begins with D?"</p>

  <p>"Democracy?" suggested Toby correctly.</p>

  <p>"That's the word; we've got to do something to keep the wolf from the
  door. The mater says that you wouldn't like to see another boarder here?"</p>

  <p>His face fell.</p>

  <p>"Well, to tell you the truth, I shouldn't," he said. "Being in the
  Government service" (this was Toby Marsh's favourite piece of fiction) "a
  sort of secret service, if you understand, I couldn't afford to have anybody
  prying and spying around my documents. And another thing, Miss Florette, you
  can trust me, being a man of discretion, if I may use the expression, but
  could you trust some stranger...? I shouldn't like to know that anybody went
  round saying that he was boarding with the great La Florette's mother."</p>

  <p>Florette bit her lip thoughtfully. She was interested in other matters,
  yet gave the impression of being wholly absorbed in this domestic problem. In
  truth, her mind was far away, and was almost wholly taken up with the news
  which her mother had given to her.</p>

  <p>"I think you're right, Mr. Marsh," she said at last, with a dazzling
  smile. "It wouldn't be a good thing. Please think no more about it."</p>

  <p>As soon as she could get away from the house she hurried back to Van
  Campe, her confidant in most matters, though she had decided in the present
  case to keep her own counsel. Still, he might help.</p>

  <p>She got back to the theatre where he had his office, and, opening the door
  without knocking, walked in&mdash;and stopped. Mr. Van Campe had a visitor. A
  funereal figure rose slowly from the table and turned his dark eyes upon her,
  and for a second she was nonplussed.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why, Dr. Laffin!" she stammered. "I didn't expect to find you
  here."</p>

  <p>The doctor's face twisted into something which was intended to be a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"I have been talking to Mr. Van Campe," he said, "and, curiously enough,
  young lady, about your good self."</p>

  <p>"About me?"</p>

  <p>In her surprise she forgot her tremendous discovery. She knew the visitor
  slightly, had met him during the period of Betty Carew's engagement, and had
  made no disguise of her hostility toward him. The mere fact that he was
  related to Betty was quite sufficient to prejudice him hopelessly in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Is zat so?" she lisped, returning to her public role of exiled
  Frenchwoman. "Zat is extraordinaire!"</p>

  <p>Laffin was looking at her thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You may think that the suggestion I have made to Mr. Van Campe is
  fantastical, bizarre, but I beg that you will not too lightly dismiss the
  scheme I have put before our friend."</p>

  <p>Before she realised that he was on the point of departure, with a little
  nod he was gone.</p>

  <p>"What was he doing here?" she asked, when the door had closed upon the
  visitor. "And what is this scheme of his?"</p>

  <p>Van Campe rubbed his bald head in perplexity.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand that guy," he said. "He came in to see me about
  getting an engagement for Carew, and I told him frankly that I was thinking
  of putting you into the cast&mdash;which of course I'm not&mdash;and that
  there wasn't room in the same theatre for you and the girl. I bragged a bit
  about your Continental reputation, and told him you mixed with the best
  people in town. In fact, I happened to mention that you dined last night with
  those two men from the Treasury. And then, before I knew what was happening,
  he had asked me whether I thought you would help him in a scheme of his."</p>

  <p>"A scheme?" she said, frowning. "What is it&mdash;a theatrical
  scheme?"</p>

  <p>"No, that's the funny thing about it," said Van Campe, shaking his head.
  "He wants to take a furnished house in the West End&mdash;he suggested
  Portman Place&mdash;put you into it, make you an unlimited allowance, the
  idea being that you give parties."</p>

  <p>"To which he shall be invited, I suppose?" said La Florette sarcastically.
  "Nothing doing, Campe!"</p>

  <p>"No, he didn't even ask that," said Van Campe. "In fact, he told me he
  would not ask to be received. He said all that he wanted was a little
  information about the stock market which might come to you."</p>

  <p>La Florette laughed.</p>

  <p>"He's crazy, if that's all he wants," she said. "I can give him a whole
  lot of information that I got out of this morning's papers!"</p>

  <p>Van Campe was looking thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"I didn't like it at first," he said, "but the more I think of it, the
  bigger opportunity it seems. You are badly in need of boost, and that kind of
  social boost is the best thing that can come to you. Besides which, there's
  nothing unusual in his suggestion. I know a family, and a good class family,
  too, that is supported by a stockbroker for the information they can collect
  from their parties. Think it over." And then: "What brought you here so late
  at night?"</p>

  <p>She immediately recalled the object of her visit.</p>

  <p>"Campe, you know everybody in town&mdash;who is Leiff Stone?"</p>

  <p>He frowned.</p>

  <p>"Leiff Stone? The name seems familiar. There's a Lambert Stone, an
  American millionaire who is a friend of De Fell's. But Leiff is a new one on
  me. Why?"</p>

  <p>She was not prepared to enlighten him apparently.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you ask De Fell? He knows the American crowd very well, and if
  he's a friend of Lambert Stone, he'd get to find out. Maybe it is some
  relation?"</p>

  <p>Van Campe jotted down the name on his blotting-pad, and nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'll see him in the morning," he said; "and now, if you don't mind, I've
  got an hour's work to do before I can leave this darned office. I've had the
  police here all day, making inquiries about that street murder."</p>

  <p>"Here?" she said, in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Yes; it appears that the murdered man called at the stage door this
  morning to see Carew, and found her. She'd come to the theatre for her
  make-up box. I was telling Laffin about it, but that didn't mean anything to
  him. I guess he wouldn't really worry if the girl was pinched."</p>

  <p>"I know somebody else who feels exactly the same way," said La Florette
  grimly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>XXIII . &mdash; GONE!</h2>

  <p class="first">LA FLORETTE was hardly out of the house before Toby Marsh
  had followed her. He saw the lights of her car turn the corner, and regretted
  that he had not the same form of transportation, for he was in a desperate
  hurry.</p>

  <p>There was no light in Bullott's parlour, but his continuous knocking
  brought Bill Holbrook, clad sketchily in a dressing-gown and his pyjamas.</p>

  <p>"Come right in. Bullott's not at home. What's the hurry? Have they found
  the murderer? Bullott is a pathetic spectacle&mdash;did I tell you that this
  was his first case?" he asked, as he preceded the visitor up the stairs.</p>

  <p>So naturally had events followed one another that it did not seem strange
  to Bill, even at that moment, that he should be entertaining a notable member
  of the criminal classes. Toby Marsh more than interested him. The mysteries
  of the man were fascinating. His unusual outlook, his queer angle of thought,
  tended to make this incongruous friendship something remarkable, and yet
  something very real.</p>

  <p>"Who is Betty Carew?" asked Toby, when they had reached the sitting-room,
  and Bill had turned on the lights and drawn down the window shades.</p>

  <p>"Who is Betty Carew?" said the astonished reporter. "The last time I heard
  of her, she was Betty Carew!"</p>

  <p>"You told me to-day that old man Laffin had a hold on her, and I've
  discovered what it is," said Toby Marsh, speaking rapidly. "She is supposed
  to be the daughter of a man named Caren, who was executed for the murder of
  his wife. I didn't know that till to-night."</p>

  <p>Bill gaped at him, but Toby did not pause.</p>

  <p>"Laffin adopted her when she was a kid, and I'll bet he's never stopped
  telling her about her grisly past."</p>

  <p>"But is it true?"</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd known all about it before," said Mr. Marsh regretfully, "and
  then I'd have created a bigger sensation when I told you it wasn't true!
  She's the daughter of an American who came to this country, married and was
  called back home, leaving his wife in the care of Mrs. Caren. The American
  was taken ill, and, for some reason or other, did not communicate with his
  young wife until after the baby was born, when he learnt that wife and child
  had both died. Apparently the woman in whose care she had been left had grown
  to like the baby, and did not want to be parted from her. That is only the
  skeleton of the story, but the man's name was Leiff Stone."</p>

  <p>Bill leapt up from his chair.</p>

  <p>"Leiff? Why, that's Lambert Stone's brother! Then Betty Carew is his
  niece! Moses!"</p>

  <p>"Leiff doesn't mean anything to me, and Lambert means less," said Toby
  Marsh, but the other interrupted him with a demand for his source of
  information.</p>

  <p>"They say that listeners hear no good of themselves," began Toby, "which
  may or may not be true. They certainly hear a whole lot that's bad about
  other people; and though eavesdropping is repugnant to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Presently Bill had the story as far as his informant could tell him.</p>

  <p>"Wait here. We'll go round and see Stone right away," he said, and dashed
  off to his room to dress.</p>

  <p>He returned in a miraculously short space of time, although his clothing
  was slightly mixed in the process of dressing. He wore a pair of evening
  dress trousers with a sports coat, and a waistcoat belonging to another suit.
  Toby felt it was not the moment to be critical.</p>

  <p>They found Lambert Stone, who had just returned from the theatre, and in a
  few brief words Bill told him all that they had learnt; the face of the
  millionaire grew grave.</p>

  <p>"It sounds true," he said. "All the circumstances fit. I know Leiff did
  marry a girl here, and that he came back to America at about the time of his
  daughter's birth. I also know that he left her in Bath."</p>

  <p>"Was he ill in America?" asked Bill, and Stone nodded. "It happened at
  sea," he said. "The ship ran into a gale, and Leiff was thrown down a
  companionway on to his head; there was a bad concussion, and practically he
  did not regain consciousness until after he arrived in New York, and then his
  condition was so serious that we thought he had lost his mind. It was six
  months before he became normal. He never told me the name of the people with
  whom he left his wife, but I know that a letter came saying that she was
  dead, and I can well remember the terrible time we had. I've hated myself
  ever since, because it was I who brought him to England, and through my
  instrumentality that he was introduced to the woman, who eventually became
  his wife. Betty Carew! Why, I met her only to-day! The story is true&mdash;I
  feel it. And verification is fairly easy; she would have been registered in
  her father's name within a few days of her birth, before Mrs. Caren could
  have ever dreamt of her scheme of deception. Poor soul! Do you know where
  my&mdash;my niece lives?"</p>

  <p>Bill nodded.</p>

  <p>"I must see her to-night."</p>

  <p>"I thought you might want that," said Bill quietly, "and I've kept the
  taxi waiting."</p>

  <p>It was near midnight when they stopped before the house where Betty lived,
  and Bill rang the bell, expecting that it would be some time before he
  received an answer. To his surprise, the landlady opened the door almost
  immediately.</p>

  <p>"Is that Miss Carew?" she asked, peering out into the dark.</p>

  <p>A premonition of danger quickened the reporter's pulse.</p>

  <p>"Isn't she at home?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I can't understand it. I came home about half an hour ago, and
  found the table in the hall broke&mdash;look!" She pointed to the wreckage of
  a small table. "Miss Carew's room was empty. She'd been to bed, too."</p>

  <p>Bill flew up the stairs, and into the room, which instinct told him was
  the girl's. The bedclothes were thrown on the floor, and here too a small
  table had been overturned. There was no other sign of a struggle.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps somebody came for her?" suggested the landlady.</p>

  <p>"I think they did," said Bill, speaking slowly.</p>

  <p>He looked round at the serious face of Lambert Stone.</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" asked the American in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"I think the mystery of the desk-selling campaign and the locked room on
  the top floor of Laffin's house, has been continued for yet another chapter,"
  he said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; THE DREAM</h2>

  <p class="first">DESPITE all the precautions that Bill had taken, Betty Carew
  had been interviewed twice by the police that afternoon&mdash;interviews
  which, however, were completely unsatisfactory as she had not seen Brother
  John before, and (in response to an urgent note that had come to her from
  Bill when he discovered that he could not prevent a police visit) she had
  said nothing about Laffin or the message.</p>

  <p>In the evening Clive Lowbridge called for her with his big car, and drove
  her into the country. Clear of London the failing sun shone in an unclouded
  sky.</p>

  <p>Clive was remarkably taciturn during the trip, and she was not sorry,
  though she found herself ruminating upon his silence and seeking a cause, for
  he had come to her that evening in his most cheerful mood.</p>

  <p>"Yes... it is this infernal murder," he said, when on the way home she
  suggested a cause. "I hate your being even remotely mixed up in it. What time
  did this happen?"</p>

  <p>"About noon."</p>

  <p>He drew a quick breath.</p>

  <p>"Thank heaven!&mdash;don't look so shocked. I'm not thanking heaven for
  this poor creature's death, but for&mdash;well, I was with the doctor from
  eleven till one o'clock."</p>

  <p>"But what has the doctor to do with it?" she demanded, aghast.</p>

  <p>"Nothing; only he's such a queer fellow, and the fact that Father
  John&mdash;Brother John, was it?&mdash;mentioned him, set my mind working all
  ways. I don't understand Laffin, never did. Perhaps he's mad. You haven't
  seen him to-day?"</p>

  <p>"No, Clive."</p>

  <p>"I've had a long talk with him. He said nothing when I roasted him about
  locking you up. You know his masterly silences? When he did condescend to
  talk, it was to suggest that I should go to America and look for a rich
  bride! He has the queerest ideas about American people; thinks that heiresses
  line the quay waiting for eligible lords! I tried to get it into his head
  that the modern American father, unless he's a hopelessly vulgar brute,
  thinks first of his daughter's happiness, and then looks round for a decent
  American boy. Laffin has never lost the tutorial pose&mdash;his superiority
  is most offensive."</p>

  <p>"Are you very poor, Clive?" she asked sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Miserably," said he. "I keep a valet to tell creditors that I'm not at
  home!" He laughed softly. "And I thought all my troubles were over when I
  succeeded to this wretched title!"</p>

  <p>He sent the car whizzing between two heavy lorries, and made it, with a
  few inches to spare&mdash;Betty jumped in alarm.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind not carrying your annoyance to extremes?" she begged. "I'm
  not especially cheerful, but suicide is outside my plans for the moment!"</p>

  <p>They returned to town as the last light of day was lingering palely in the
  sky, and stopped before the little house where she had her lodging. The place
  was in darkness, and, after a brief tour of the house, she returned to the
  sidewalk, where Clive sat at the wheel of his machine.</p>

  <p>"I can't ask you to come in," she said; "my landlady is not at home.
  Good-night, and thank you, Clive."</p>

  <p>She had a splitting headache, and was glad to carry the glass of milk she
  found waiting for her in the hall to her room; doubly glad to swallow the
  aspirin they had bought at a chemist on the outskirts of London, gladdest of
  all to snuggle her head into the pillow and feel herself sinking, sinking,
  into that delicious languor, which precedes the oblivion of sleep.</p>

  <p>She had dreams, fitful, aching dreams that changed with every throb of
  head. Dreams of Clive and Dr. Laffin, and the still figure stretched on the
  sidewalk. Fantastic dreams of an untidy reporter stroking her face tenderly.
  She struggled to move her head... wondered if his fingers were still
  ink-stained... felt hot lips pressing hers, and fought somebody back. And
  over and through all her unhappy imaginings was a low drone of sound and a
  queer vibration of movement.</p>

  <p>Now she was back on Dartmoor and a cowled face was looking down into hers.
  She saw it loom from the darkness, black against black, and the glint of
  eyes.</p>

  <p>She moaned in her sleep and tried to turn, but the bed had grown
  unaccountably narrow and hard and sagged in the middle so that she was
  imprisoned within its sides.</p>

  <p>It was the queerest dream, for once she heard a long discussion about what
  was and what was not the right road, and she saw the flash of a lantern and
  heard a man cursing softly.</p>

  <p>"The reporter and a man... came half an hour after...."</p>

  <p>Somebody had telephoned&mdash;she could not catch the name.</p>

  <p>After that she felt a cold hand touch hers, and the sharp prick of a
  needle above her wrist. She struggled desperately to rouse herself from her
  sleep, but the scream died in her throat, and then she slept dreamlessly.</p>

  <p>Her room was still pitch dark when she came to consciousness, but the bed
  was bigger&mdash;wider than her own. Putting out her hand toward the table
  where the candle was, she found nothing.</p>

  <p>"I'm still dreaming," she murmured, and lay for a long time debating
  whether she should make an effort to wake or continue her sleep.</p>

  <p>By the time she had decided, she was sitting in a high-backed chair,
  looking stupidly from left to right.</p>

  <p>She was in a chapel, high-roofed, dimly lit. Facing her was a white altar.
  Two large candles glowed in golden sconces, and that, it seemed, was all the
  light there was.</p>

  <p>Flanking the altar were two lines of stalls, massively carved, and above
  each stall was a banner, heavily embroidered with gold. She caught the dull
  glitter of the bullion in the faint golden light of the candle, and saw that
  the stalls were occupied. In each there sat a black cowled figure, motionless
  but not silent.</p>

  <p>She looked down; she was dressed in white&mdash;her feet were bare, and
  across her knees was a crimson stole.</p>

  <p>The cowled figures were chanting something, a drone of sound that seemed
  to be tuneless, until she remembered. Years before she had attended a recital
  of old English music, and had heard a quaint dirge that the lecturer had told
  her was the Song of Triumph, composed in honour of Henry's victory at
  Agincourt. It was that they were singing... the words were
  indistinguishable.</p>

  <p>"O revealed!"</p>

  <p>Midway between her and the altar was a man in a long violet gown, his head
  and face covered, as were the others, by a hood. But she knew the voice,
  could have sworn to it&mdash;the voice of the old man who had come to her at
  the store. The Man of the Message! What strange shapes a dream takes, she
  thought.</p>

  <p>"Into your hands I deliver The Law, divine Messenger of the Absolute!
  Write, that the law shall be complete and the gap of the circle filled!"</p>

  <p>She heard a murmur by her side, and turned her throbbing head. Left and
  right of her stood two black-gowned men.</p>

  <p>Something heavy was laid on her knees. It was a thick brown book, and
  instinctively she grasped it. Why, she did not know. Perhaps it was slipping
  from her.</p>

  <p>"Hold it... hold it to your breast!" hissed a voice in her ear, and
  mechanically she obeyed.</p>

  <p>The cowled men were filing out. She heard the swish and shuffle of sandals
  on the stone floor and the deep-throated discordances of the ancient hymn...
  And now she was alone&mdash;alone save for the two cowled figures.</p>

  <p>"Rise!" The order came sharply, and again she obeyed.</p>

  <p>They took her by the arm, and slowly paced by her side. Through a narrow
  doorway, along a cold passage. Rattle and clang of bars and bolts, and
  another door opened.</p>

  <p>They were in the open... the fresh night winds played against her
  cheek.</p>

  <p>"I want to wake up!" she cried wildly, and remembered no more.</p>

  <p>When she opened her eyes the first thing she saw was the drawn face of
  Bill Holbrook. He was standing at the foot of her bed, and she noticed that
  his waistcoat was buttoned in the wrong holes, giving him a grotesquely
  lopsided appearance.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're in it, too, are you?" she asked faintly. "But you mustn't kiss
  me. I don't like people kissing me, Mr. Holbrook!"</p>

  <p>A second man was bending over her, a grey-haired man who wore large
  horn-rimmed spectacles.</p>

  <p>"Headache?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"A little&mdash;not much. Where am I now?"</p>

  <p>"You're in hospital now," he said. "Do you feel strong enough to tell us
  how you got to Clapham Common in the middle of last night?"</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes wide. She was awake&mdash;her mind was very clear.</p>

  <p>"What day is it?"</p>

  <p>"Thursday," was the reply.</p>

  <p>It was on Tuesday night that she had gone to bed!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; BETTY DOES NOT REMEMBER</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was not till a day later that Betty learnt of the
  extraordinary circumstances under which she was found. A police patrol, who
  crossed Clapham Common just before daybreak, saw a figure stretched on the
  grass, and, thinking it was a sleeping vagrant, stepped over the low rails
  that separated the path from the grass-land, and walked toward it, flashing
  his lamp upon what appeared to be a big bundle of rugs.</p>

  <p>Not the least remarkable feature of the discovery was that, not only was
  the girl, as it proved to be, swathed in blankets and lying upon a hospital
  stretcher, but in order to ensure her safety, the rugs enclosed rubber water
  bottles, which were still hot when she was found. The policeman had called up
  an ambulance, and Betty had been transferred to the nearest hospital.</p>

  <p>"I suppose my disappearance is in all the papers?" she said ruefully. "I
  am beginning to suspect you of an intensive publicity campaign, Mr.
  Holbrook!"</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That isn't the kind of publicity you'd get from me, Miss Carew," he said
  quietly. "You are sure you remember nothing?"</p>

  <p>"No, nothing." She was emphatic on that point. "I had some queer dreams,
  but I remember nothing after lying down in my bed, until I woke yesterday in
  the hospital."</p>

  <p>This time Bullott was present at the interview.</p>

  <p>"Did you drink anything before you lay down?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Some milk," she said. "My landlady generally leaves me a glass in the
  hall."</p>

  <p>"That, of course, could have been got at if the people were waiting for
  you in the house, as I suspect they were." He had found that the landlady was
  got out of the way by the simple process of sending her a reserved stall for
  the Lyceum. A messenger boy had brought it in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Does Dr. Laffin know?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"He has been told, but he is not very much interested," said Bill. "He
  said that he thought you would turn up sooner or later."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Holbrook," she said, just before he went, "was I dreaming last night,
  or did Mr. Lambert Stone see me?"</p>

  <p>"You weren't dreaming this time. And, Miss Carew, you're going to tell me
  something about those dreams of yours, aren't you, when you're well
  enough?"</p>

  <p>"I'll try; they were extraordinary. I don't even know now whether they
  were real or imaginary."</p>

  <p>"If there was any about my kissing you," said William Holbrook coldly,
  "you can put that down to imagination right away," and grinned to see her
  flush. "No, it was Lambert Stone you saw all right. He's got some news for
  you when he comes to see you this evening."</p>

  <p>"For me?" she said in surprise. "What kind of news?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;" awkwardly&mdash;"it's pretty good for you, that's all!"</p>

  <p>"This," said Bullott, when they walked out through the shady grounds of
  the hospital, "is the craziest crime that has ever been committed. The girl
  is unharmed; she has obviously been kept under the influence of drugs; the
  doctor suggests scopolamin, which would keep her in a state of coma for two
  days, provided she were kept in the dark; and when she is found, she is
  wearing a white silk robe over her nightdress&mdash;a robe which her landlady
  has never seen before, and which I don't suppose Miss Carew would recognise
  if she saw it. Another point; when she is picked up by the officer, she is
  lying on a stretcher&mdash;an ordinary Army stretcher that you can buy at any
  war depot for a pound. That means that she's been wherever she has been in an
  ambulance, or some car that was originally used as an ambulance. I've had all
  the hire depots investigated, and I've had reports from the country
  constabulary around London, but no ambulance has been reported, which cannot
  be accounted for, though, if it carried no distinguishing marks, and
  travelled in the night, I should not expect a report."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to suggest that she was two days and two nights unconscious?"
  asked Bill incredulously.</p>

  <p>"From her point of view, yes," said Bullott. "If you were to see a person
  under its influence you would not imagine that he or she was drugged. Its
  effect is to destroy the recollection of what passed a few seconds before,
  and our only hope is that there were moments when the effects of the dope
  wore off and she can recall to us some incident which will put us on the
  track. What does this bird wish?"</p>

  <p>"'This bird' was a shabby man who had been waiting for them on the street
  outside, and now moved as though to intercept them. The face was that of a
  weakling; his irregular features, the small, unshaven chin, the furtive look
  in his small, pale eyes, said to Holbrook, something of a physiognomist,
  'criminal.' To Mr. Bullott, with his amazing memory for faces, it said two
  words.</p>

  <p>"Well, Tinker, how long have you been out?"</p>

  <p>Tinker's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"Tinker Lane," introduced Bullott with embarrassing frankness, "a ladder
  larcenist between voyages, eh, Tinker? He's called Tinker because he's a
  sailor&mdash;that is a peculiar form of English humour which will not appeal
  to you, Holbrook. What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want nothing from you, sir," whined the man, recognising
  authority in the inspector's tone. "I wanted to see this gent. Somebody told
  me he was a reporter."</p>

  <p>"Me?" said Bill in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>Bullott drew off discreetly, leaving them alone.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir,"&mdash;the man's hoarse confidence was flavoured with a
  strong smell of liquor&mdash;"but when I was on a voyage to Orstralia, there
  was a fellow serving with me who told me he got a lot of money out of
  newspapers by telling 'em something about a sea serpent that he'd seen with
  his own eyes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you're trying to tell me a sea serpent story, you're letting all that
  good vinous breath run to waste," said Bill, good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, it ain't that."</p>

  <p>Bill was looking at him curiously. He wore a pair of corduroy trousers, a
  ragged blue jersey up to his neck, and the greasy cap on his head had once
  adorned the head of a ship's officer.</p>

  <p>"I've got a story that's worth pots of money!" said Tinker. "I'll bet it's
  worth thousands! Here, look at this, mate!"</p>

  <p>With elaborate caution he looked round to see if he was observed, and
  then, diving deep into his trousers pocket, he produced a little green and
  gold star, with an inscription in the centre, which Bill saw was in Greek,
  though he was insufficiently acquainted with that ancient tongue to translate
  or even read it.</p>

  <p>"Five points," said Tinker Lane impressively. "Pain, Sorrow "&mdash;he
  ticked them off with a grimy forefinger&mdash;"Hunger, Thirst and Death.
  How's that?"</p>

  <p>"Sounds pretty good to me," said Bill. "What is it supposed to be? A
  patent medicine ad?"</p>

  <p>"No, it ain't, it's a story."</p>

  <p>For the third time he looked nervously around.</p>

  <p>"What did they ask me to come in for&mdash;me, that never had any
  education and never wanted it; me that has been in bird"</p>

  <p>"'Bird.'?" said the puzzled William.</p>

  <p>"Quod&mdash;you know, prison&mdash;over the Alps&mdash;anything you like.
  I've been in four times. You wouldn't think they'd want a man like me, would
  you? As a matter of fact, I didn't understand what they were jabbering about.
  It made me laugh to hear this big guy in a black cloak talking about duty and
  responsibility and all that hunk. But I had to go through with the first
  degree, and when it was over they come for me&mdash;tapped me on the shoulder
  as I was going out of the lodge."</p>

  <p>"The Proud Sons of Ragusa?" gasped Bill.</p>

  <p>"Got it first time. The fellow that tapped me was an old shipmate of mine,
  a chap that got five years in Singapore for knifing the mate of a ship he was
  sailing with. He told me they picked him up in the East India Dock Road when
  he was down and out."</p>

  <p>Bill turned and beckoned Bullott to him.</p>

  <p>"Listen to this," he said. "Our friend is telling me a little story about
  the Proud Sons that will make your ears prick!"</p>

  <p>"I haven't given you the story yet. You've only got the beginning of it,"
  the dilapidated Tinker made haste to assure them.</p>

  <p>"Wait," said Bill, and told his friend what had already passed between
  them.</p>

  <p>"When this man tapped you on the shoulder&mdash;this old shipmate of
  yours&mdash;what did he want you to do?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know it was him, to tell you the truth. He had one of those
  bed-gowns on. But he told me to wait for him outside, and we went off to the
  White Hart to have a drink, and he spilled the rest of the yarn. He said
  they'd picked him up in the East India Dock Road, down and out, took him up
  to the lodge and made him a member&mdash;the Limehouse Lodge,
  Number&mdash;well, I don't know what the number is, anyway, it was Limehouse.
  The biggest lodge in London. After that they made him into the Twenty-Third
  Degree. That's what I am&mdash;the Twenty-Third Degree," he said
  impressively. "You'd never guess it, would you? But I am; I can go down to
  any of these Ragusa fellows and make 'em do what I like&mdash;in a sense! I
  couldn't make 'em give me money without putting 'em out: I know that because
  I've tried. But it's one of the swell lodges."</p>

  <p>"You're a member of the Twenty-Third Degree, and that star&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah! That star!" said the other, with grinning triumph. "That's what I'm
  going to tell you about. What's going to be done in July&mdash;the twenty-
  ninth of July? Do you know what I am?" He pointed to himself. "I'm second
  engine-room guard. It's worth ten thousand quid to me. You wouldn't believe
  it&mdash;ten thousand quid, and I haven't got the price of a doss!"</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Bill, "it doesn't seem that it's worth while your
  telling the story for a few paltry pounds."</p>

  <p>The man shook his head vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand wouldn't buy my neck: I love myself too much. Besides, how
  do you know they're not going to double-cross me? It would be the easiest
  thing in the world. I know something better. You slip me five hundred of the
  brightest and best, and I'll give you a story that'll make your hair stand on
  end, and all your newspaper readers go blue with fright. You think I am
  bluffing, but I'm not. It's the bird in the hand I want, and I've been
  following you about London all day trying to get a word with you, though I
  didn't know this gentleman was a busy, or may be I wouldn't have come up and
  talked to you now. I can get a ship next week for the River Plate, and with
  five hundred in my pocket I could have a peach of a time in Buenos Aires. Do
  I get the money?"</p>

  <p>Bill thought a while quickly.</p>

  <p>"I can't give you the money myself, but I'll speak to my editor," he said.
  "Will you come to my house to-night at nine o'clock?"</p>

  <p>The man accepted the offer eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Make it ten," he said. "I've got to meet my friend at nine. And have the
  money ready&mdash;this is a sensation I And say&mdash;why ship flour to
  America? And canned meat to America, and rifles and booze&mdash;openly?
  That's funny, ain't it? So long!"</p>

  <p>And with no other word of explanation he slouched off.</p>

  <p>"Toby couldn't have been more mysterious," said Inspector Bullott.</p>

  <p>Inspector Bullott knew much more about the Proud Sons of Ragusa than Bill
  Holbrook imagined. It was not for amusement that he had spent half the
  previous night in the newly furnished house of one who, by an act of fortune,
  had suddenly found himself a comparatively rich man. But Bullott's craving
  for information was insatiable.</p>

  <p>There was a Government department which dealt with "friendly societies,"
  and he made a call on the chief of the bureau, to discover that he might have
  saved himself a journey.</p>

  <p>"The Ragusas do not come under my observation," said the official. "We
  deal solely with benefit societies, that is to say, with societies the
  members of which pay a certain sum a week and receive sick pay, insurance and
  similar benefits. The Ragusas come into the category of social clubs, and
  make no returns of their membership."</p>

  <p>He cited another famous order similarly circumstanced.</p>

  <p>"All that I know of them is that they are a perfectly innocuous
  association with an extremely large membership. There has been a suggestion
  that their method of dispensing big prizes comes under the Lottery Act, but
  you, as a police officer, will know more about that than I. As a matter of
  fact," he confessed, "quite a number of men I know are members, and they are
  eminently respectable persons. You will never eradicate from human nature the
  desire to dress up."</p>

  <p>There was little in this unsatisfactory interview to add to the sum of
  Bullott's knowledge. More interesting were the confidential reports which he
  was receiving from the coast towns. Some of these were a little
  disquieting.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand what has come over the Ragusas lately," wrote the
  Chief Constable of Northport. "They seem to be gathering the worst elements
  in the town; and if they had somebody recruiting members at the prison door,
  I should not be surprised. I have had one or two complaints from men who have
  been members of the order for years, and who say that the class of membership
  is falling very considerably. I knew at least three new Ragusas who have
  convictions behind them, and one of these is a man who has been twice tried
  for attempted murder, and escaped through a disagreement of the jury!"</p>

  <p>Bullott filed the report and read another, similarly couched. The Tinker,
  then, was not the only hard case recently initiated into the mysteries of the
  Proud Sons.</p>

  <p>Later in the evening he made another call at the hospital. The girl was up
  and anxious to return to her lodgings.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to ask you a question, Miss Carew, and I'd like you to give a
  lot of thought before you reply. You have some confused recollection of what
  happened to you after you were taken from your house?"</p>

  <p>"Very confused," she smiled, "so confused that even now I am perfectly
  certain I saw you and Mr. Holbrook."</p>

  <p>"Did you by any chance see Dr. Laffin, or hear his voice?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I have no recollection whatever, though one of the voices I heard was
  familiar. Do you think Dr. Laffin was responsible?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't like to mention any names," said the diplomatic Bullott.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember." She shook her head again. "I certainly have no
  impression of the doctor. The only thing I am certain about is that I was on
  a stretcher. I was found lying on a stretcher, wasn't I? Well, I must have
  been on that most of the time. I have a distinct recollection of my bed
  sagging in the middle, and I'm sure I must have been in a car, for I remember
  distinctly the buzzing and vibration, and somebody saying that we had lost
  the way." She laughed softly. "Perhaps Mr. Holbrook was not in it, but that
  part of my dream was very vivid."</p>

  <p>"About his kissing you?" asked the unemotional Bullott, and she gasped and
  went red.</p>

  <p>"How did you know?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"You mentioned something about his kissing you when you woke up."</p>

  <p>She was silent for a little while.</p>

  <p>"If you ever discuss this with Mr. Holbrook, I wish you would emphasise
  the fact that the experience from beginning to end was a nightmare. Please
  remember to say that."</p>

  <p>Bullott smiled to himself as he went out. That little conversation would
  bear repeating, he thought, but unfortunately, when he reached his house Bill
  Holbrook was out.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; A TALK WITH DR. LAFFIN</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL had not seen Laffin since the night the doctor had lost
  his golden buckle. He had very wisely left the police to interview him
  concerning Betty Carew's strange disappearance, with what was, to a reporter,
  the utterly unsatisfactory result of exonerating that gentleman from any
  complicity in her abduction.</p>

  <p>When he arrived at Camden Road, the door was opened to him by a strange
  servant&mdash;strange also to the doctor, it would seem, for she hesitated
  when, as Bill suspected, she should have told him that Dr. Laffin was not to
  be seen.</p>

  <p>"Come in, sir," she said, closing the door behind him. "If you'll sit down
  in the hall for a minute, I'll find out whether the doctor will see you."</p>

  <p>There came from the study the sound of voices raised in altercation, and
  she had to knock twice before a sharp voice bade her come in. She heard the
  doctor's smothered exclamation of annoyance, heard his snarl and the flow of
  cold-blooded vituperation at the mistake which the unfortunate servant had
  called forth. Then a man came out of the room, flushed and angry, but with a
  ready smile for Bill.</p>

  <p>"You're Holbrook, aren't you? I'm Lord Lowbridge. I think we've met
  before. Are you seeing this old devil to find out his responsibility for the
  outrageous treatment of Miss Carew? You can save yourself a lot of trouble;
  I've been trying for the past hour. Nevertheless, he's in it up to his neck,"
  he said, lowering his voice, and then, seeing the frightened servant in the
  doorway, he nodded and went out.</p>

  <p>Whatever fury Bill's arrival had evoked in the bosom of Dr. Laffin, all
  trace of emotion had vanished when the visitor stumbled into the dark room
  and groped his way towards a chair which he would never have known was there
  to receive him, but for a gleam of light upon its polished back.</p>

  <p>"I understand that you wish to see me, Mr. Holbrook?" The doctor was his
  old, mincing self, soft-voiced, superior, imperturbable. "It is fair that you
  should know that I have little sympathy with the methods of the modern
  Pressman. Even the highest and the most intellectual newspapers in the land
  seem to have adopted the objectionable hustle of the cheaper Press.
  Fortunately, newspapers are not necessary to me, and publicity is my <i>bête
  noir</i>."</p>

  <p>Thank you for those encouraging words," said Bill cheerfully, "but I
  haven't come to interview you about Miss Carew's disappearance. I understand
  the police have already seen you, and that you knew nothing whatever of the
  matter until you were informed?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Carew and I are not on terms of confidence." The doctor put his long
  finger-tips together, and was leaning back in his chair, looking down at the
  table. "The opportunities which I have offered to her have been so often
  flouted, my authority so continuously despised, my charity&mdash;for I have
  been charitable&mdash;so ungraciously rewarded, that I have almost ceased to
  take an interest in her future."</p>

  <p>"By charity, I presume you mean your adoption of her when she was a baby?
  I've been wondering, Doctor," said Bill quietly, "whether you knew, when you
  took that child from the poorhouse, that her father was Leiff Stone"</p>

  <p>The doctor's hands were palm to palm beneath his chin. He was ridiculously
  like some mediaeval saint in the act of devotion. But at Bill Holbrook's
  words, both hands dropped with a thud upon the table, and the hard, black
  eyes met his.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he said harshly.</p>

  <p>"You didn't know, then, that the Carens were not the parents of the girl
  who calls herself Elizabeth Carew? That she was the daughter of Leiff Stone,
  who left his wife in the care of the Carens when he returned to America?"</p>

  <p>In the silence that followed, Bill could hear the man's quick breathing,
  but not a muscle of the yellow face twitched, the eyes did not waver.</p>

  <p>"It seems almost like an extract from some popular work of fiction," said
  Dr. Laffin at last. "When did you learn this?"</p>

  <p>Holbrook told him, in a few words, without, however, revealing Toby Marsh
  as the source of the information.</p>

  <p>"I confess that I did not trouble to search the register," said Laffin,
  after a pause. "You say that Mr. Lambert Stone is perfectly satisfied that
  the girl is his niece, and that Mr. Leiff Stone was her father?"</p>

  <p>"'Was'?" repeated Bill sharply. "Is he dead?" Laffin's face was a
  mask.</p>

  <p>"How am I to know, if I do not number this gentleman amongst my
  acquaintances?" he said smoothly. "'Was' or 'is'&mdash;does it matter? All
  things are, for the spirit essence is indestructible."</p>

  <p>"We will keep away from the occult, if you don't mind, doctor," begged
  Holbrook. "I am a little out of my depths when I lift my mind from the Camden
  Road, and the is-ness of things."</p>

  <p>The doctor rose.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for coming, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Holbrook, I think your name is?
  I must write to my little Elizabeth and congratulate her. She will, I have no
  doubt, remember with gratitude the care that I lavished upon her."</p>

  <p>"I guess she won't have much chance of forgetting," said Bill coolly. "But
  that wasn't all I came to see you about, Doctor. Your Twenty-Third Degree has
  got me guessing."</p>

  <p>Laffin raised his hand in protest, and in so doing made the almost
  imperceptible sign of the Ragusas.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't mean anything to me," said the calm Bill, "and if you're
  going to pull any of that stuff about the oath of the Proud Sons and the
  responsibilities of brotherhood, I shall say things to you which I may
  regret. What is this Twenty-Third Degree? How do you come to be the head of
  it? I'm asking you "&mdash;he spoke slowly, leaning over the table, his palms
  on its edge, his face within a few inches of the doctor's&mdash;"because
  there's something behind the Ragusas, something you know, something that is
  sinister and outside of the law. The Ragusas are decent men, with decent
  men's childish delight in passwords and signs and grips, and the fool play
  that is part of the joy of secret societies. But the Twenty-Third Degree
  doesn't belong to the plumbers and bakers and icemen who get thrilled every
  time they mask their faces and think they're being conspirators. How came you
  there, right on top?"</p>

  <p>"The Twenty-Third Degree," began the doctor, "as you ought to know as a
  Ragusa&mdash;I dislike most intensely discussing the mysteries of that noble
  order&mdash;has ever been a degree of honour"</p>

  <p>"Forget it," said Bill. "The Twenty-Third Degree was moribund till you
  went into it. It consisted of about fifty ancients who dabbled in occultism,
  acting as a buffer between the lower degrees and the swell fellows on top,
  the Priors. But those old guys are out of the Twenty-Third; they've been
  returned, one by one, to their various lodges, and other men have taken their
  places&mdash;men you've selected yourself. What's the idea, Laffin?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Laffin's lips tightened, so that they were scarcely visible.</p>

  <p>"I refuse, utterly refuse, to discuss the secrets of the Ragusas," he
  said. "If you were not entirely lost to shame, to all sense of decency, you
  would not press such an indelicate question upon one who has the honour"</p>

  <p>"Leiff Stone&mdash;where is he?"</p>

  <p>Laffin's eyes blinked at his questioner, but he did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Where is Leiff Stone?" asked Bill Holbrook slowly and deliberately. "The
  man who called at the store in Duke Street, the man in the black cassock and
  the sandals, who came to Betty Carew and asked for 'the message'? The man who
  expected to see her there, sitting in a green dress at a desk on which was a
  jade vase and one red rose? Where is Leiff Stone?"</p>

  <p>Laffin licked his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, I don't understand you. You're mad to ask such questions,"
  he said, and for the first time since Bill had known him there was a tremor
  of anxiety in his voice. "And if I knew I would not tell you. How dare you
  come to me&mdash;to me, of all people in the world? You shallow-brained,
  material&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rough talk doesn't worry me," said Bill. "I'm acquainted with a news
  editor who can give you a pretty long start in the matter of offensive
  invention. Now I'm going to tell you something." He tapped with his knuckles
  on the desk to emphasise every word. "Leiff Stone is, or was, the Grand Prior
  of the Ragusas."</p>

  <p>Dr. Laffin walked across to the door and opened it slowly. "Good-night,"
  he said, with extravagant politeness. "I have thoroughly enjoyed our
  conversation."</p>

  <p>Bill nodded. There was nothing more to be said, no profit in any further
  interview. He walked out into Camden Road with a sense of triumph. He had got
  under the doctor's skin, and he had hurt.</p>

  <p>He drove to the Press Club, for he had a column to write on the latest
  developments of the Brother John murder, and it was nearly eleven o'clock
  before he joined Lambert Stone. Mr. Stone had spent the greater part of the
  evening at the hospital, for, although Betty had recovered, the doctors had
  thought it wise to detain her for another day.</p>

  <p>"You told her about your relationship?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, she was dazed, but pathetically glad," said Stone. "I don't think
  she quite realised how her supposed parentage has clouded her life. She told
  me that Laffin never ceased to taunt her with the fact that she had a
  murderer's blood in her veins."</p>

  <p>"What difference will it make to her position? Your brother is a rich
  man?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," smiled Stone. "He was very rich once; our father left us
  each two million dollars, and probably Leiff is still a wealthy man. But that
  doesn't matter very much, does it? I'm a bachelor; Betty is my only relative,
  and I'm not exactly a poor man."</p>

  <p>Bill scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said, without enthusiasm. "Miss Carew&mdash;I'll still call
  her that, if you don't mind&mdash;goes into the desirable heiress class?"</p>

  <p>"With a lordly lover ready made," laughed Stone. "The first person she
  asked for was Clive Lowbridge."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" said Bill coldly. "Isn't that grand!"</p>

  <p>Stone was eyeing him keenly.</p>

  <p>"You don't like Lowbridge?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I like him very much." Holbrook roused himself with an
  effort to cheerfulness. "Oh no, I've nothing on Lowbridge,
  only&mdash;somehow&mdash;I don't like these international marriages."</p>

  <p>He was astonished at himself; his voice was husky, he had a queer
  sensation of pain, for which he could find no adequate cause.</p>

  <p>"I'll be getting along," he said, after an awkward pause. "I'm glad you
  told her. She's rather... sweet, that niece of yours."</p>

  <p>He walked down the stairs, passed the night porter with a nod, and stepped
  out into the cool night air, curiously shaken. As he stood, a little numb
  with the realisation of his folly, a car came slowly past. He looked at it
  dully, seeing yet not seeing. Then, from the place where the driver sat,
  leapt a red pencil of flame, and Bill Holbrook crumpled in a heap on the
  sidewalk.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; RAGUSA TALK</h2>

  <p class="first">LAMBERT STONE was halfway down the stairs with Holbrook's
  coat on his arm, when he heard the shot. The night porter had also heard the
  <i>plock!</i> of a pistol fired with a silencer, and reached the huddled
  figure before Stone came running up. Together they lifted the unconscious
  reporter and carried him into the elevator.</p>

  <p>"'Phone a doctor," said Stone quickly, when they had laid him on the sofa
  in his sitting-room. "If that is the only wound, there is no serious
  injury."</p>

  <p>The bullet had struck above Bill Holbrook's right eyebrow, and followed
  the eccentric course which bullets sometimes take, for it had emerged from
  the skin at a point above the ear, having completed a half-circuit of his
  head, without, so far as Stone could discover, penetrating the bone at any
  place. The wound was ugly enough, and the night porter had no doubt that the
  victim was dead, but Lambert Stone, who had passed his youth in a community
  where gun-play was a normal circumstance of life, diagnosed the injury with
  greater accuracy.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, there was a doctor in the building, and his brief examination
  confirmed Lambert's view.</p>

  <p>"There is no fracture," he said, busy with his needle, "and the longer
  this young man remains unconscious, the easier it will be to fix him."</p>

  <p>The dressing of the wound was nearly completed, when Bill opened his eyes
  and stared up into the face of his host.</p>

  <p>"Nearly got me, I guess," he said faintly.</p>

  <p>"You didn't see the shooter?"</p>

  <p>"No... same as Brother John... got me from the car."</p>

  <p>Save for a racking headache, he was his normal self when Bullott came.</p>

  <p>"I called at Laffin's on my way," he said. "He hasn't left the house all
  evening&mdash;I know this because I've got a shadow watching him. You were
  there to-night&mdash;you told him something?" he challenged.</p>

  <p>"Yuh," said Bill.</p>

  <p>"What was it&mdash;Ragusa talk?" asked Bullott, with a pretence at
  carelessness.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-Third Degree, mostly. Why I did it, I don't know; I should have
  been kicked&mdash;it was my weakness for sensation made me so darned
  talkative. I know why I was shot all right. What's the time?"</p>

  <p>"A quarter to twelve."</p>

  <p>Bill made a little grimace of pain.</p>

  <p>"I've got to see that man," he said. "I can go, can't I, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Unless it is very important," hesitated the doctor, "I don't think you
  should be moved."</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> important," said Bill emphatically, and sat up with a
  groan.</p>

  <p>It was only when he swore that he would go to bed the moment he arrived
  home, and that he would get a nurse and a surgeon on the following morning to
  dress the wound, that the doctor agreed.</p>

  <p>Midnight was chiming from a church clock when Bullott and Lambert Stone
  helped him out of the cab, and up to his room. A man was standing in the
  shadow of the doorway; Bill saw him the moment he reached the sidewalk; but
  it was not the Tinker.</p>

  <p>"Got you, did they?" said a cheerful voice. "I somehow thought they'd go
  gunning for you when I heard you spilling your trouble to the doctor."</p>

  <p>It was Toby Marsh, and Bill stared at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>"You heard? You weren't in the doctor's study."</p>

  <p>"I'm there every night," said Toby Marsh, with a smirk. "You couldn't keep
  me away from Laffin; we're like brothers!"</p>

  <p>Toby sat on the edge of the bed, the stub of an unlighted cigar between
  his white teeth, his dancing eyes fixed upon the patient.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have been a reporter," he said. "I've got more newsgetting
  ideas than any of the cubs I've met in my professional life. Lord! when I
  think of the scoops I could have got," he said reminiscently. "I'll tell you
  something, Bullott, as a guarantee of good faith, as the newspapers say. I
  did a two years' course of deed-box work. That's a new one on you? In that
  two years I broke into a hundred and twenty-three lawyers' offices. It was a
  hobby, you understand; just an in-something-able curiosity&mdash;what's the
  word? Thank you&mdash;insatiable. There's no money in lawyers, but a whole
  fortune if I'd been 'putting the black'.* I did other work, because a man's
  got to live, and hobbies are expensive. But the documents I've read! The
  bundles of letters, tied up with red tape, what wives have said to their
  husbands and what husbands have said to their wives, the confessions and
  deeds of assignment&mdash;there's a Cabinet Minister who's been paying three
  thousand a year blackmail for the last twelve years; did you know it?" He
  mentioned a great name. "I'm a reporter, I tell you&mdash;I want to know. A
  lot of people think that a born reporter is a fellow who wants to write, but
  that's not so, and Holbrook will tell you the same. A born reporter just
  wants to know, and he doesn't care a darn whether he writes or whether he
  doesn't."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Blackmail.]</p>

  <p>"I'll swear you were not in that room," said Bill vigorously. "It was
  fairly dark, but you couldn't have been concealed"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't within a mile of that room," confessed Toby. "Nevertheless, I
  was there, if you understand, in the spirit. My ego was projected upon an
  astral plane&mdash;I don't know whether that's right, but it sounds like some
  of the stuff I've heard in Laffin's office&mdash;and, oh gosh! it's
  easy!"</p>

  <p>He was intensely amused, convulsed with internal laughter. Presently he
  took off his gold-rimmed spectacles and wiped them dry.</p>

  <p>"When the weather goes cold, I'm finished as a source of information. But,
  barring this accident, I'm your special correspondent at headquarters."</p>

  <p>"You'd make a lot of money if you went straight," said Bullott with
  reluctant admiration.</p>

  <p>Toby Marsh's nose wrinkled.</p>

  <p>"You're talking like a judge. 'If your energies had been directed into
  proper and legitimate channels, you might have made an honest living, instead
  of which you are going down for nine moons with hard labour.' No, sir,
  burglary is my long suit, and all the rest are recreations. I'd sooner open a
  burglar-proof safe, or burn out a fire-resisting lock, than I'd see my name
  over the finest story that was ever printed."</p>

  <p>"You're a bad man, and will come to a bad end," said Bullott.</p>

  <p>"I shall end up as a churchwarden," said the other calmly, "highly
  respected by the folk of a cathedral city, and admired by my neighbours.
  Maybe I'll take dinner with a bishop every other Thursday&mdash;you never can
  tell. Or perhaps I'll get a knighthood. The Prime Minister's daughter will
  get locked up in a safe, and nobody can open it; somebody thinks of Toby
  Marsh; he arrives in the nick of time and saves the daughter amid loud
  applause. I saw a play like that. I have my dreams."</p>

  <p>Bill glanced at Bullott, who looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"You can save yourself a lot of trouble&mdash;he won't come."</p>

  <p>"Who?" asked the startled inspector.</p>

  <p>"Tinker," was the reply, "the gentleman who was calling to spill the
  beans. I've been looking for him all night, and if I can't find him, there
  isn't a busy that ever strolled out of Scotland Yard disguised as a gentleman
  who could succeed. I've searched every dive from the Edgware Road to
  Whitfield Street. I've asked the nearest approach he's got to a friend. I've
  been to his lodgings in Seven Dials&mdash;where all the coon-jazzers
  live&mdash;and there's no sign or sight of him&mdash;hasn't been seen since
  four o'clock this afternoon, when he had a cup of tea at Bony's coffee-shop.
  Is it likely he'll come?"</p>

  <p>As though in answer to his question, came one heavy knock at the street
  door, and Bullott went down the stairs two at a time.</p>

  <p>A shabby looking man stood on the doorstep, but it was not the Tinker.</p>

  <p>"Name of Bullott?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"That's my name." The detective took a letter from the man's hand. "Here,
  wait!" he called, as the messenger was making a rapid retreat, but he took no
  notice of Bullott's instruction.</p>

  <p>The letter contained one word&mdash;"Detained." No signature, date, place
  or address. He went out into the street, but by this time the man who had
  brought the note was running, and it seemed that no useful purpose could be
  served by bringing him back.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of this?" he asked, returning to his party. "Take it by
  the edge; I'm going to bring out the finger-prints."</p>

  <p>Bill took the note from his hand, and read the word.</p>

  <p>"I suppose there's no doubt that this is from the Tinker?"</p>

  <p>"'Detained' is a word that the Tinker wouldn't use," said the
  irrepressible Marsh. "It doesn't belong to the three thousand six hundred and
  twelve words that make up the lowbrow's vocabulary. If you think the number
  is less, take any page in a dictionary and count the words that everybody
  knows."</p>

  <p>"That isn't the Tinker's writing, anyway&mdash;for the simple reason that
  he can't write," said Bullott, looking at the letter again.</p>

  <p>He went downstairs and returned with a small phial half-filled with a fine
  violet powder, and shook a little on to the paper. This he worked round
  dexterously until the note-paper was covered with a violet film of dust. When
  he blew the residue into the fireplace, a thumb-print was visible in one
  comer.</p>

  <p>"And that's yours," grunted Bullott, nodding at Bill. "The man who wrote
  this wore gloves."</p>

  <p>He treated the envelope in the same way, and here, as he expected, the
  prints were many, and, to his practised eye, the majority of them were
  thumbmarks made by the same individual.</p>

  <p>"We may be able to trace the messenger, but the writer has left no
  sign."</p>

  <p>Bill sat up in bed, and reached for the cigarette box.</p>

  <p>"The twenty-ninth of July, things are going to happen. That date intrigues
  me. And what did he mean by saying that somebody was shipping canned beef and
  flour to America&mdash;and rifles, too, if I remember rightly? Bullott, I'm
  keeping that appointment on Sunday night, and I'm going alone."</p>

  <p>"In which case you'll return in company," interrupted Toby promptly.
  "There'll be an ambulance man, two doctors, a bunch of policemen, and may be
  the mortuary keeper. You're referring to your appointment on the Epping
  Road... third milestone, if I remember? I thought so! Son, I admire your
  courage, but your intelligence is beneath contempt. There's only one place
  for you in the course of the next week or two, and that is behind a steel
  wall, eating food that you've prepared yourself."</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean that?" asked Bullot seriously.</p>

  <p>Toby nodded.</p>

  <p>"You bet I mean it," he said, "you bet I mean it!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; THE SEEN PRIOR</h2>

  <p class="first">THAT a man should be shot dead in broad daylight, on one of
  the most crowded streets of London, and that the murderer should have
  escaped, offered to the leader-writer of every metropolitan newspaper an
  opportunity and an excuse for calling into question the prescience and genius
  of the detective force.</p>

  <p>The Chief sent for Bullott, and, without a word, handed him a thick bunch
  of newspaper cuttings, and the first thing that caught the inspector's eye
  was a paragraph:</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">"In the circumstances it is rather remarkable that the
  officer in charge of the case should be Inspector Bullott, who, we
  understand, is in this way making his acquaintance with the procedure of
  criminal detection. Hitherto, Mr. Bullott has occupied an important position
  in the Records Department of Scotland Yard, where he has rendered admirable
  service to the State, but which can hardly have fitted him for the duty he is
  now called upon to perform."</p><br>

  <p>Bullott's heart went down with a thump. The rosy dreams of success,
  already dim, faded greyly.</p>

  <p>"Read the next one," suggested the police chief.</p>

  <p>The second of the leaders was even more ruthless.</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">"Mr. Bullott, who is in charge of the case, is certainly
  pursuing methods which are, to say the least, unorthodox. Despising the
  assistance which trained and efficient police officers, accustomed to such
  cases, could give to him, he seems to be satisfied with the help of a man of
  doubtful antecedents and a reporter attached to the staff of one of our
  contemporaries. Admirable as this combination may appear to the inexperienced
  Mr. Bullott, an anxious public will not be impressed&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>"The third one is almost as bad," said the Chief, and the troubled
  Inspector Bullott took up the third cutting reluctantly.</p>

  <p>It was from the <i>Post-News</i>, a journal, which carried considerable
  influence in Government circles.</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">"... frankly, we must ask Scotland Yard to consider
  seriously whether they are taking all the steps possible to bring to justice
  this unknown assassin. As frankly, we state that it is, in our opinion, a
  grave error of judgment to place so important a case in the hands of an
  inexperienced police officer, a gentleman who has never before handled so
  much as a minor prosecution&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I suppose that means you want me to go back to my office, sir?" said
  Bullott.</p>

  <p>The old chief chuckled.</p>

  <p>"It means nothing of the kind," he said. "I've been on to the
  newspapers&mdash;I know the editors of most&mdash;and I've found that those
  leaders were written on information supplied yesterday afternoon from a
  source which they, of course, refuse to reveal. The information was couched
  in the same terms, all having one object, which is to clear you out of this
  case. And they wouldn't be worrying about you and your peculiar friends if
  there wasn't a reason&mdash;it is quite enough for me, Bullott, that they
  wish you replaced. I'll take the unpopular course of confirming you in that
  appointment. The police force that is popular isn't doing its duty! Now, what
  about this shooting of Holbrook? How is he, by the way?"</p>

  <p>"Practically well," said Bullott. "The Press knows nothing about this last
  attempt, and I propose to keep it quiet for a day or two."</p>

  <p>The chief nodded.</p>

  <p>"Marsh may be a difficult proposition for you to handle, but there's
  nothing new in making use of a man of his questionable past. And he's a
  character&mdash;I wouldn't be surprised if he knew much more about this
  business than you give him credit for."</p>

  <p>The conference lasted an hour, and when Bullott issued into the street the
  first thing he saw was an early newspaper bill:</p>

  <p class="headline">"Murder Witness Kidnapped."</p><br>

  <p>Betty's story was now public property. Bill Holbrook's column had been the
  big news of the morning, and although he had dealt as sketchily as possible
  with the girl and her experience, he had left no doubt in the reader's mind
  that her disappearance from London for three days was directly associated
  with the murder of Brother John.</p>

  <p>"Not that I'm sure about that," he said, when Bullott had returned and
  showed him the paper. "When we can persuade this young lady to tell us her
  dreams, we shall probably form another opinion&mdash;you got a good roasting
  from the morning papers, Bullott. What do they say at headquarters?"</p>

  <p>Bullott turned up his thumbs suggestively.</p>

  <p>"The opposition is organised, of course," said Bill, laying down the
  paper, "and that brings me down to Laffin. There is a Laffin touch in that
  stuff that can't be mistaken. And, if you want news, here's an item that'll
  tickle you to death; La Florette has taken Lord Towcester's house in Portman
  Place for the season, and is entertaining on a large scale, prior to her
  departure to winter in South America. You don't see anything funny about it?
  I do! Florette is nearly broke, so is Van Campe. The failure of his last show
  has brought more creditors to his doorstep than he can accommodate. In fact,
  Florette&mdash;whose other name is Hamshaw&mdash;has started economising.
  Toby Marsh lodges with her mother and knows. A year's rent of that Portman
  Place house is about two thousand pounds; it will cost five thousand a year
  to run&mdash;and that is without etceteras." Bullott was only mildly
  interested.</p>

  <p>"That's her trouble," he said.</p>

  <p>"And yours too," said Bill, and before he could explain what he meant,
  Bullott's housekeeper announced a visitor.</p>

  <p>It was Mr. Pawter, and in the quiet eyes that gleamed behind his thick,
  horn-rimmed glasses was a ghoulish satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"This comes of leaving the innocent pursuits of commerce, William," he
  said, glancing approvingly at the white-bandaged head. "If you had remained
  at Pips, you would not have been shot up."</p>

  <p>"How the devil did you know I was shot up?" asked Bill in
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"It has just come on the street, in the later editions," said Mr. Pawter.
  "That is why I called."</p>

  <p>By this time Bullott was halfway down the stairs to his telephone. He had
  many friends on the Press, and his first call was at the <i>Evening
  Gazette</i>.</p>

  <p>"It came through on the tape," said the news editor reproachfully. "You
  might have tipped us off, Bullott."</p>

  <p>"What agency sent it out?" demanded the inspector.</p>

  <p>"The Central Association."</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Bullott had friends at this court also, but they could give
  him little satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"We had a 'phone call this morning saying Holbrook was shot, and one of
  our reporters saw the hall-keeper in Albermarle Street, and interviewed the
  doctor who attended him."</p>

  <p>"There's a very busy newsgiver wandering round," he said, when he returned
  to Bill and told him the result of his investigations.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter, except to you," said Bill. "I presume the idea of
  spreading the report is to discredit you still further as a sleuth."</p>

  <p>"They can go right on discrediting," said Bullott, with quiet
  satisfaction. "I don't suppose that it matters. The Chief has given me a new
  assistant&mdash;" he glanced at Mr. Pawter, listening open-mouthed, and
  decided that it was not a moment for confidences.</p>

  <p>"To me the whole thing is inexplicable," Mr. Pawter felt called upon to
  utter a few platitudes. "In fact, everything that has happened to me in the
  past few weeks has been inexplicable. Take Laffin and his desk and the
  red-haired girl in the window. Isn't that remarkable? And, what is more
  extraordinary than the terrible murder we read about in the newspapers a few
  days ago? The newspapers seem to think that the officer in charge of the
  case"</p>

  <p>"Let me introduce you to him," smiled Bill Holbrook, "and for heaven's
  sake, think for yourself, Pips. As long as I've known you, your mind has been
  a distorted reflection of your favourite leader-writer."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said Mr. Pawter, obviously embarrassed. "I&mdash;er&mdash;of
  course did not know that this was Mr. Bullott. I always thought his name was
  Bullock."</p>

  <p>His <i>faux pas</i> had the effect of hastening his departure. "Remember,
  William, there is a desk for you at Pips whenever you wish to return. Mr.
  Lambert Stone has very kindly placed his selling campaign in our hands, and I
  shall be glad to arrange your return on a new salary basis."</p>

  <p>"That is Father Pips," explained Holbrook, when his relative had gone.
  "Pawter's Publicity Agency, my respected cousin, a bachelor, has no criminal
  tendencies so far as I know, except a passion for gramophone music, and is
  not even remotely connected with the Proud Sons of Ragusa"</p>

  <p>"That's where you're wrong," said Bullott. "He's the Seen Prior of that
  exalted order."</p>

  <p>"The Seen Prior? What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"I've been going into this Ragusa question rather thoroughly," said
  Bullott, "and I have collected more information in the past few days than I
  ever hoped to get. It is part of the scheme of the Proud Sons that no brother
  shall know another, though, of course, so far as the lower ranks are
  concerned, this idea doesn't work, and isn't expected to work. But, higher
  up, amongst the Grand Lodge folk and the Twenty-Third Degree, and higher
  still, amongst the Priors of the Order, the system of secrecy is a rigid one.
  There are fourteen Priors: the Grand Prior, twelve others in residence, and
  the fourteenth, who comes occasionally and acts for the Grand Prior in
  certain matters. He's the only man whose face is never covered. That man is
  Pawter!"</p>

  <p>"You're crazy!" said Bill.</p>

  <p>"I tell you I'm speaking by the book. I've had a man down in Dartmoor, and
  we've trailed the Priors to their home. Twelve years ago, an old monastery on
  the edge of Dartmoor came into the market as the result of a branch of a
  religious order returning to Italy, where it belonged. The property was
  purchased on behalf of the Ragusas by Pawter himself. It is a queer, ancient
  building, surrounded by a high wall in the most desolate part of Dartmoor,
  and thousands of pounds were spent in renovation before the Grand Priors came
  into residence. The Priors do not know one another. They live fairly well;
  each has his own suite, and is waited upon by a lower order Ragusa, specially
  chosen for the purpose, and well paid for the job. Pawter goes down to the
  Priory every six months, and when you think the matter over you'll realise
  the wisdom of having one of the Priors unmasked. Twice a year the lottery
  occurs, which has made the Proud Sons of Ragusa so popular with the
  speculating public. The man who does the drawing is Pawter. It is carried
  out, of course, in the presence of the others, and every precaution is taken
  to ensure the draw being a fair one. Hundreds of thousands of metal-rimmed
  tickets, on each of which is written the official number of a member, are
  placed in a barrel and turned. The Seen Prior puts his hand through an
  aperture, takes out a ticket, and that is the first prize-winner. I should
  not have known this but for the discovery I made last night, that every man
  who draws a big argosy is present at the next drawing, under a vow of
  secrecy, of course. I interviewed four of the lucky ones before I could get
  one to talk, and by an odd chance it happened that he knew Pawter personally,
  and had worked in his office. Now I'm going to tell you something else; the
  head of the order is Leiff Stone. My informant told me something I did not
  know; that there was a Chaplain of the Priors, a short, stout man, whose face
  naturally he did not see, but whom he heard addressed as 'Brother John'."</p>

  <p>Bill whistled.</p>

  <p>"Here's a problem for you"&mdash;Bullott spoke slowly&mdash;"Brother John
  is the confidant of the Grand Prior, the most trusted member of the order.
  Why was he shot? I am taking the strongest party of police that ever went to
  Dartmoor, and raiding the Grand Priory, and when I come out, the murderer of
  Brother John will be in my hands!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29"></a>XXIX. &mdash; A STRANGE OCCURRENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">CLIVE'S flat was indeed a restful spot. At his suggestion,
  Betty Carew, newly released from hospital, had broken her journey to have tea
  with him. She lay in a deep armchair, soothed by the greys and blues of the
  appointments. The geraniums in the window-boxes were a mass of scarlet
  blooms, relieved by the pale gold of the calceolarias. Through the open
  casement a gentle breeze stirred the curtains and brought a faint fragrance
  of heliotrope from the little garden below. Benson was setting the tea-table,
  a capable figure of a man. Clive had gone down to get an evening newspaper
  with the account of the attack upon Bill Holbrook.</p>

  <p>"This is a very peaceful place, Benson."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss, it is remarkably well situated, and very close to the
  tubes."</p>

  <p>She smiled to herself at this utilitarian view.</p>

  <p>"His lordship finds the flat small," Benson went on, "and I have no doubt
  it is for a gentleman who would, I am sure, wish to entertain on a larger
  scale. If his lordship married, it would be impossible," he added as an
  afterthought, and she laughed.</p>

  <p>"I don't think his lordship contemplates matrimony, does he?"</p>

  <p>"I have not his lordship's confidence in the matter," said Benson primly,
  and at that moment Clive returned.</p>

  <p>"Here's the account. Your friend seems to be in the wars."</p>

  <p>"He thrives on trouble," she said.</p>

  <p>"What were those dreams of yours, Betty? I've got an idea that, when we're
  able to disentangle reality from the dream, we'll have a pretty good notion
  of what happened to you." She dismissed the subject with a weary gesture, and
  wisely he turned the conversation into more pleasant channels.</p>

  <p>"So you're a rich woman now, Betty? That is most embarrassing to me."</p>

  <p>"Why to you especially?" She laughed. "I'm not rich. I've discovered some
  amazing relations, but I don't think it will make a great deal of difference
  to me. But why are you embarrassed, Clive?"</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;I think you know without my telling you. I want to marry
  you badly, Betty; I wanted to marry you when you were broke and I was broke,
  and marriage seemed so very, very possible. And then you refused because you
  thought you would be a drag on me. Now that you are rich, I can't ask you
  because "&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"I hate the idea of marrying
  money."</p>

  <p>She laughed again.</p>

  <p>"Poor Clive! I think the old objection stands. Mr. Lambert Stone is rich,
  but in all probability my father is a very poor man&mdash;and not only poor,
  but crazy! It isn't nice to talk about one's father, but I can't think of him
  except as I think of any other stranger."</p>

  <p>"Craziness is due to an accident which might have happened to you or to
  me," interrupted Clive.</p>

  <p>"I don't offer that as a serious objection," she said. "The question as to
  whether I am rich or poor really makes no difference at all, Clive. I'm going
  on with my career&mdash;I've told Mr. Lambert Stone as much&mdash;and please
  don't think that the discovery of long-lost relations means that I'm going to
  make my home with Mr. Lambert Stone, and that the world is going to witness
  the meteoric rise of Betty Carew!"</p>

  <p>He was sitting opposite to her, his elbows on his knees, a strange look in
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Betty!" he said in a low voice, "you're going to marry me next week!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You're going to marry me next week," he repeated doggedly. "Nothing in
  God's world will stop that."</p>

  <p>"There is something that will stop it." She had taken a sudden resolve. "I
  can't marry you."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated, summoning all her reserves of courage. Then:</p>

  <p>"Because I'm Joshua Laffin's wife&mdash;I married him three years
  ago!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30"></a>XXX. &mdash; DOPE</h2>

  <p class="first">BETTY was Joshua Laffin's wife! He was stunned by the
  news.</p>

  <p>"It happened on my seventeenth birthday," she went on in a lifeless voice.
  "I had discovered something about the doctor; he had been guilty of a most
  heartless fraud. I was acting as his secretary at the time, and I detected
  him in the act of forging a document which transferred property to him of an
  old man who was his patient. I didn't know then why he did it, but he
  insisted that I should marry him right away. I was terrified, until he had
  promised me that, if I agreed, he would let me live by myself somewhere. Like
  a fool, the chance of gaining my liberty at the expense of such a bondage was
  so alluring that I agreed, and we were married before the registrar. The same
  day I moved into the rooms which I have occupied off and on ever since."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't love you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He made that clear on the day of our wedding, and he has taunted me many
  times since that I trapped him into the marriage. The truth was that he
  feared a criminal prosecution would follow the discovery of the forgery, and
  he married me to keep my mouth shut, knowing that a wife may not give
  evidence against her husband."</p>

  <p>Clive Lowbridge sat motionless, his eyes fixed upon her face.</p>

  <p>"I never guessed," he said simply.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I can divorce him, and I should do that if"&mdash;she shrugged
  her shoulders&mdash;"if there were any excuse. But, Clive, he has given me
  nothing; his life is austere; he has never been really cruel to me&mdash;not
  cruel enough to secure a divorce in England. I'm just shelved until he
  dies."</p>

  <p>"The old devil!" he whispered. "The wicked old devil!"</p>

  <p>A soft knock on the panel of the door. He turned with a start as Benson
  came in, carrying a silver tray.</p>

  <p>"Mr. William Holbrook is below, sir." He passed the information casually,
  in the way of a well-bred servant.</p>

  <p>"Here? What does he want?" said Clive in surprise. "Ask him up, Benson,
  and put another cup for him."</p>

  <p>Bill looked white and drawn, and though the bandage about his head had
  been reduced to minimum proportions, she saw at a glance that the injury had
  been more serious than was reported.</p>

  <p>"You been in the wars, too, Holbrook?" asked Clive good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"Somewhat," was the laconic reply. "How do you do, Miss Stone? I didn't
  expect to find you here."</p>

  <p>Her lips twitched at the "Miss Stone."</p>

  <p>"You ought to be in hospital."</p>

  <p>"I really ought to be in an insane asylum," said Holbrook as he sat down.
  "Have you seen your respected relative?"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't deigned to call upon me," she said, "and I am not very
  sorry."</p>

  <p>Bill grunted something.</p>

  <p>"The doctor is&mdash;strange," he said aloud, and she felt that he was
  showing admirable restraint.</p>

  <p>Clive was wondering what was the object of the reporter's call, until Bill
  Holbrook caught his eye, then, taking advantage of Betty's discreet
  retirement to admire the window-boxes, he walked out of the room and Bill
  followed.</p>

  <p>"I want to put a question to you, Lord Lowbridge. Do you know anything
  about the Sons of Ragusa?"</p>

  <p>Clive looked at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I know something, yes, as much as most people know. It is a friendly
  society, is it not?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly that," said Bill, grimly. "But are you aware that Laffin holds a
  very high position in the order?"</p>

  <p>"No, that is news to me," said the other frankly. "In fact, it is so
  incredible that I take leave to doubt"</p>

  <p>"It's a fact," interrupted Bill. "He is the head of the Twenty-Third
  Degree."</p>

  <p>"The news is surprising, and yet not surprising," said Lowbridge, after a
  pause. "His eccentricities are proverbial. Was it to tell me this that you
  called?"</p>

  <p>"Partly," said Bill, "and partly to ask you whether you saw anything of
  him the night Miss Carew disappeared?" Lowbridge shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He could not possibly have had anything to do with the abduction," he
  said. "He was on the telephone to me at midnight, and asked me to go round to
  his place to see him about an impoverished property of mine in which he is
  interested. Of course, I did not go."</p>

  <p>"He was establishing an alibi?" suggested Holbrook, and Clive shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I hardly think so. It was not remarkable in him to call me up at that
  hour, for the doctor has no idea of time. As you are probably aware, he does
  not sleep like a normal man, but has those queer ten-minute intervals of
  unconsciousness which seem to satisfy all his needs. I saw him the following
  day; he called here on the same matter, and I'll swear that he was in town
  that same night, for I went to his place and stayed with him for the greater
  part of an hour..." he hesitated. "I ought to tell you that his great scheme
  of transferring my land had the elements of trickery in it that annoyed me
  most intensely. I only discovered it last night. You probably noticed, when
  you came to Camden Road, that I was rather heated? The man has no conscience
  and no scruples. He puzzles me sometimes, at other times he fills me with
  despair. For under his eccentricities, there is something about him that I
  like, and I shall not, of course, forget our earlier association, when he
  gave me his time and his genius to educate me. But what do you mean about the
  Sons of Ragusa? That seems a fairly inoffensive association. Do you think
  they were concerned in the kidnapping of Miss Carew?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so, I am certain," said Bill vigorously. "Laffin may not
  have been a member of the party, but I'll swear he directed operations."</p>

  <p>Clive came back alone, to Betty Carew's surprise. "Where is the tireless
  Mr. Holbrook?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Gone. He's on Laffin's track, and is obsessed with the idea that the old
  man was responsible for your kidnapping, and, upon my word, he's almost
  convinced me! Betty, do you remember&mdash;can you concentrate your mind upon
  the forty-eight hours you disappeared? Can you recall any single incident
  which would help us to get at the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I can," she said quietly. "The incidents are beginning to
  sort themselves out, and whilst I recognise that most of them are absurd and
  fantastical, the chapel and the masked men"</p>

  <p>"Chapel?" he said quickly. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"In a day or two I shall probably realise that these are fantasies also.
  But I have a recollection of being taken into a chapel&mdash;a tiny little
  place, with men who looked like monks, sitting in the stalls on each side of
  the altar; and I'm sure I heard the voice of the man who came to me at the
  store for the message. He gave me something, a book&mdash;I am certain it was
  a book&mdash;and called me the 'Long-Desired.' Before and after that, my
  memory is a confusion of impossible happenings. But of that time I am
  certain. I am going to write it down to-night for Mr. Bullott."</p>

  <p>He strode up and down the room, his hands behind him, his brow knit in
  thought. Then he rang the bell, and, to Benson, who appeared immediately:</p>

  <p>"Get me all the evening newspapers that are on the streets," he said. "You
  may have to go to Piccadilly for the <i>Globe-News</i>, but get it."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked in surprise, after Benson had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"I have a theory. It is only a theory, and I think it can be tested by the
  information that has already been published." And then, unexpectedly: "What
  do you find fascinating about my geraniums?" he asked, half good-humouredly,
  half-irritated.</p>

  <p>"Fascinating?"</p>

  <p>"You were staring at them."</p>

  <p>"I suppose they hold my eye," she said, looking round at the window-box
  with its flaming petals. "Clive, you're a bundle of nerves!"</p>

  <p>"Have I reason?" he asked. "I've had the misery of your abduction, and on
  top of it all, the terrific news you have given me about Laffin. You'll get
  the marriage annulled, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir."</p>

  <p>It was Benson, who had come in noiselessly.</p>

  <p>"When you said all the newspapers, did your lordship mean the Socialistic
  journals?" he asked. "Your lordship has forbidden those newspapers to be
  brought into the house."</p>

  <p>"Of course, I mean them all," said Clive, with a touch of asperity.</p>

  <p>When the man had bowed himself out:</p>

  <p>"Why the dickens did he come back?"</p>

  <p>"Nerves again!" she laughed. She took up her cup. "Is it cigarettes or
  this insidious little cup?"</p>

  <p>"Both," he said, and swallowed the hot tea with a wry face.</p>

  <p>In a much shorter time than he had expected, Benson returned and laid the
  newspapers at his master's elbow.</p>

  <p>Clive opened one at random, skimmed the news, opened another and a third,
  and finally threw the journals on the floor in disgust.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing new here at all," he said.</p>

  <p>He spoke a little thickly. She looked at him in alarm; his face had gone
  white, his eyes had a queer, glazed appearance, and when he rose to his feet
  he stumbled, and would have fallen if she had not put her arm to assist
  him.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, Clive?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know." He passed his hand across his forehead. "Something queer,"
  he muttered.</p>

  <p>She pressed the bell, and Benson came in almost immediately, and together
  they laid Lowbridge upon a sofa. His eyes were closed, his breathing was
  heavy, and when she spoke to him he did not answer.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, Benson?" she asked in alarm.</p>

  <p>Benson stooped, lifted the eyelids of the unconscious man.</p>

  <p>"I think he has been drugged, Madam," he said blandly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31"></a>XXXI. &mdash; IN EPPING FOREST</h2>

  <p class="first">"I THINK, if you will leave him with me, he will be all
  right," said Benson. He was feeling Clive's pulse with a professional touch.
  "The heart action is normal, and there is nothing to be alarmed about. If you
  would prefer that I called a doctor"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I would," she said emphatically.</p>

  <p>He bowed, and presently she heard his voice at the telephone. Until a
  neighbouring doctor arrived she did not leave the unconscious Clive.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," said the medical man. "He hasn't been smoking opium?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Has he been smoking at all?" The doctor looked down at the cigarette ends
  in the hearth. "Egyptian cigarettes, I see? It often happens that these
  cigarettes contain opium in large or small quantities, introduced, in my
  opinion, by the makers, to give them flavour... sometimes through the
  carelessness of the workpeople an additional quantity gets into the
  tobacco...."</p>

  <p>He expounded his theory at length. When Clive was showing some sign of
  returning consciousness she left him in the doctor's charge and drove home,
  and, about an hour later, he himself telephoned to say that he had quite
  recovered.</p>

  <p>"That fool of a doctor thought it was dope in the cigarettes," he said,
  "but I'm perfectly satisfied that my cigarettes are as harmless as candy;
  and, what is more, if they're Egyptian, they're made in England."</p>

  <p>"You're not ill, are you, Clive?" she asked anxiously, and he laughingly
  reassured her.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not ill, but I'm infernally suspicious!"</p>

  <p>He did not elucidate this cryptic remark, and when she called him again
  later in the evening, he was his old, cheerful self, and did not discuss the
  queer happening of the afternoon.</p>

  <p>"I have Mr. Bullott with me now," he said, lowering his voice. "You
  haven't seen him, by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"No," she replied.</p>

  <p>"I've been telling him about the dream you can remember. He doesn't seem
  to be as impressed as he might be." She cared very little whether Mr. Bullott
  was impressed or not. Her main grievance against the detective was that there
  had come a new lodger to the house that afternoon, and her landlady, in a
  flutter, had informed her that the ground floor room, so long empty because
  of the extortionate price demanded (the landlady dreamt dreams of
  entertaining a wealthy American family) had been let to a man she knew,
  through some obscure source of family information,&mdash;a detective.</p>

  <p>She did not think it necessary to tell Clive this, but a great deal of her
  resentment at being treated as somebody who needed watching disappeared
  toward bedtime, for when she locked her room door it was with a feeling of
  satisfaction that on the floor below slept Muscular Authority.</p>

  <p>Although she was very tired, she did not fall asleep readily, turning from
  side to side, her mind a confusion of thoughts and recollections. And there
  began to take shape an uncomfortable feeling that an identical object was to
  be found in the abduction and in her experience as a showgirl. She could find
  no other common denominator for the two unpleasant incidents&mdash;except Dr.
  Laffin.</p>

  <p>Towards one o'clock she remembered, with a sense of dismay, that she had
  accepted an invitation to breakfast with her new-found uncle in Albemarle
  Street, and by sheer force of will she drove herself into sleep.</p>

  <p>And then she felt the dreams beginning all over again. The movement, the
  sensation that somebody had his arm about her shoulder, and that horrid,
  burning pain in her right forearm. She struggled more desperately to regain
  consciousness than she had on the previous occasion, flung out her arms
  wildly, and felt her knuckles bruise against something hard. Then the creak
  of a door, footsteps on the stairs, and the sound of struggle in the hall.
  Somebody screamed; it was the landlady. Then there was a sound like a violent
  explosion, which she guessed was the street door slamming, and with trembling
  hands she switched on the light.</p>

  <p>Her room door was open, and as she stepped out unsteadily on to the
  landing the light came on in the hall, and she saw a man in violently striped
  pyjamas, struggling into his overcoat.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Miss," he called up, and she guessed, rather than knew,
  that this was the detective that Bullott had put into the house.</p>

  <p>She went back to her room, and after ten minutes there was a gentle tap.
  She opened the door to find the detective.</p>

  <p>"Did they come into your room? There were two of them," he said. "I don't
  know what made me sleep. They must have been as silent as cats."</p>

  <p>"Who was it?" she asked tremulously.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Miss. There were two of them." He rubbed his head, and
  under his hand she saw a lump like a pigeon's egg. "They coshed me," he said
  tersely. "Do you mind if I come into your room and have a look round?"</p>

  <p>The shivering landlady had joined the party by now, and stood with Betty
  watching the detective conduct his search. He stooped to pick something from
  the floor.</p>

  <p>"Here's a hypodermic, half filled with something," he said, shaking it.
  "No, there's nothing else, as far as I can see. Gosh, that fellow was a big
  'un&mdash;the man that hit me! I guess his heart was pure all right."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked innocently.</p>

  <p>"Because he had the strength of ten," said Officer Brown, and evidently
  this was a stock jest with him, for he shook with laughter. "There's no other
  trouble? You'll have to get some bolts on that door and a chain."</p>

  <p>"Do you think they came after me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I ought to be kicked for letting them get past me. Bullott told
  me to shoot, but I've got an Englishman's constitutional objection to using a
  gun."</p>

  <p>Apparently he telephoned to Bullott, for later, as she was dropping to
  sleep, she heard that officer's voice in the hall, and, looking at the
  phosphorescent dial of her watch, saw that it was a quarter to three. She
  heard no more, for she slept steadily till her landlady wakened her at
  half-past eight.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brown says you're not to go by 'bus or train; he has a car waiting
  for you," was her remarkable news, and Betty found that this was the case.
  Looking out of the window, she saw a handsome saloon, obviously hired, and it
  was in state that she drove up to Albemarle Court, and Lambert Stone, waiting
  for her on the tiny balcony of his study-drawing-room, chuckled to
  himself.</p>

  <p>"You are sensible, after all," he said, as he took her wrap. "I told you
  to spend money"</p>

  <p>"That car doesn't belong to me," she interrupted solemnly. "I wouldn't
  have been guilty of such a piece of extravagance I But Mr. Bullott thinks
  that, having been abducted once, and a second attempt having been made, the
  third time may pay for all."</p>

  <p>He listened with a grave face while she tried to make light of her second
  adventure of the night.</p>

  <p>"That's bad," he said. "Young lady, I'm going to take you off to
  America."</p>

  <p>Her mouth opened.</p>

  <p>"Not really?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he nodded. "We're sailing on the <i>Escorial;</i> on Saturday
  week&mdash;I booked the tickets provisionally last night. You needn't stay in
  America," he went on hastily, "I promise you that I will not attempt to make
  an heiress of you. But you ought to see our great country, and somehow I
  think you'll come often when you've seen it once! And I'm making up a party;
  I've just been on to Lowbridge, and he has promised to be my guest. I'll even
  invite your favourite reporter"</p>

  <p>"Please don't," she asked hastily, "if by 'favourite reporter' you mean
  Mr. Holbrook."</p>

  <p>He laughed again.</p>

  <p>"Why, that's unkind," he said, "considering William discovered
  you&mdash;William and his questionable friend. Anyway, you'll come?"</p>

  <p>"It will be fun. Where do we go&mdash;to New York?"</p>

  <p>"New York will hardly suit you in July," he said, with a twinkle in his
  eye. "No, we're going up to my camp in the Adirondacks. That will be an
  experience for you, young lady, and I shall be able to look after you there,
  with Laffin three thousand five hundred miles away."</p>

  <p>"You still believe Dr. Laffin is the villain of the piece?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"We all believe that&mdash;Holbrook, Bullott and I. I haven't asked
  Lowbridge; I guess he's too loyal to say what he thinks!"</p>

  <p>On the following Sunday afternoon Bill Holbrook awoke from his afternoon
  doze, struggled sleepily to his feet and filled his pipe before he went out
  and filled his bath. His unfinished notes for Monday's newspaper lay on his
  table, and he read them over, his lip curling at the thought of his own
  inadequacy.</p>

  <p>"Padding," he growled, "padding and stalling!"</p>

  <p>And he was not far from the truth. The Brother John murder had ceased to
  fill the important columns of the newspapers, and had been relegated to
  ten-line paragraphs on inside pages. Newer matters of public interest usurped
  the leading columns, and Bill Holbrook's <i>raison d'être</i> was
  disappearing.</p>

  <p>When he had come out of his bath and returned to his room, he found
  Bullott in his shirt-sleeves, a black pipe between his teeth, a scowl of
  utter misery on his unshaven face. He stood glaring out of the window at his
  garden, a patchwork quilt of living colour.</p>

  <p>"Cheer up, misery," grunted Bill. "It is I who am going to be killed
  to-night!"</p>

  <p>Bullott took out his pipe, and turned his head slowly. "You're not going
  on the Epping Road."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Bill. "It will be broad daylight at nine o'clock; the
  road will be alive with cyclists and motorcars; nobody is going to kidnap
  me."</p>

  <p>Bullott resumed his pipe and his unhappiness.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand this affair. I'm well out of my depth," he said. "I
  suppose I ought really to hand over my job to a real policeman."</p>

  <p>"Real nothing!" snarled Bill. "What's the matter with you, Cuthbert? Do
  you expect things to unfold themselves as quickly as they would in a short
  story? You're nutty! Besides, you're finding out something new every
  day."</p>

  <p>"But is it worth finding out?" demanded the other, in a tone of complete
  weariness. "I seem to spend my time discovering the roots of other trees! Do
  you remember some time ago telling me about an immense sea captain you'd
  met&mdash;a big man with a voice like a foghorn?"</p>

  <p>Bill nodded.</p>

  <p>"I saw him to-day," Bullott went on, "and trailed him&mdash;to where do
  you think? To a respectable lodging in Bloomsbury, where he goes to bed at
  ten every night and gets up at six every morning, and doesn't do anything
  more criminal than smoke cigarettes. So they tell me&mdash;yet if Harvey Hale
  wasn't one of the people who tried to lift Miss Carew last night I'm a
  lunatic. I told Marsh this, and the poor mysterious hound got so excited, you
  might have thought I'd given him information that the murderer of Brother
  John was under lock and key!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe his excitement was justified," said Bill. "When are you making your
  raid?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow night&mdash;unless I get fired from this job before," said
  Bullott.</p>

  <p>"You have had no word from Tinker Lane?"</p>

  <p>Bullott's grimace was the answer.</p>

  <p>"He has got cold feet," he said; "possibly one of the Twenty-Third Degree
  folk tipped him off that he was running risks&mdash;you can easily scare that
  kind of fellow. Or, what is more likely, if there is any sort of illegality
  in the degree they have paid him to skip."</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Did they pay Brother John to skip?" he asked, and Bullott did not
  reply.</p>

  <p>When Bill Holbrook reached the third milestone on the Epping Road, he
  found that his prediction was more than fulfilled. As far as he could see,
  the long forest road was covered with cyclists and motor-cars, and the chance
  of a repetition of the attempt which had been made upon him was even more
  remote than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>The third milestone was a little difficult to discover; it stood back from
  the roadway and was half-covered with undergrowth, but what had an especial
  interest for him was the white envelope which must have been placed there
  very recently, for the wood was filled with strolling couples and it was
  hardly likely that the letter would have escaped observation had it been in
  its place any considerable time.</p>

  <p>Never doubting that it was for him, he pulled it from the thorny briars
  which held it in its place, and, as he had expected, he found his name
  written on the cover.</p>

  <p>"Follow the red confetti," was all that it said.</p>

  <p>He looked round; there was no sign of confetti, red or otherwise. And
  then, peering into the cool depths of a wood, he thought he saw something red
  on the ground, and went nearer. Yes, that was it, a sprinkle of tiny red
  paper discs beneath a tree. He went a little distance farther on, and now the
  trail was clear.</p>

  <p>It led him along a well-worn path, and was so carefully laid that Bill
  guessed that the average pleasure-seeker (and he interrupted a dozen
  indignant couples in their more tender moments of confidence) would not
  notice its presence. After a while it left the path, branching off to the
  right, and threading a way between the trees. And now he met fewer and fewer
  strollers. A quarter of an hour's quick walking brought him up with two
  children who were lost in the forest, and the red trail seemed to show them a
  way to the road.</p>

  <p>It was clear to him that the part of the wood through which he was now
  moving was one which was very seldom visited by picnic parties. Every few
  steps he took startled some wild creature in the underbush. He had a glimpse
  of a hare flying to his burrow; he saw a lithe black shape darting through
  the grasses in pursuit of his quarry; and once he disturbed a vixen with her
  prick-eared litter. And the red confetti led on and on, until it crossed a
  small stream on the farther banks of which his unknown guide had left the
  paper more thickly strewn that it might not escape his attention.</p>

  <p>He had to climb the bank before he came to a plantation of young trees, so
  thick that it was with some difficulty that he made his way into the depths.
  He stood and listened; no sound broke the stillness of the quiet forest; the
  dusk was coming, the light in the sky had deepened to a richer and darker
  blue; the dying sun's rays shot slantwise, and when he reached an open space
  his shadow ran at incredible length along the grass before him.</p>

  <p>The sun gave him his direction; he was travelling southeast, and had been
  travelling south-east all the time, but suddenly the trail shot off at right
  angles, and he followed cautiously, his hand upon the round, hard object in
  his pocket, every sense alert.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes' walking brought him within view of a small lodge hut, the
  kind which he knew was employed by the park rangers for the storage of their
  tools. It lay in a clearance at the foot of the slope down which he was
  moving when he first sighted the building. Again he stopped, looked and
  listened, but saw and heard nothing. Down the gentle hill the trail led to
  the rough door of the hut, and there stopped.</p>

  <p>His heart was beating a little faster as he walked quickly to the door,
  gripped the handle and pulled it wide open. The interior was in darkness; he
  heard neither the breathing of men nor movement, and looked round
  suspiciously at the darkening forest. He looked again into the hut; his eyes
  were now accustomed to the gloom, and he saw something moving, something that
  swayed left and right rhythmically.</p>

  <p>He struck a match, and stepped back with a gasp of horror.</p>

  <p>Hanging from a beam in the roof was the body of a man, and, as he looked,
  the distorted face turned towards him. It was the face of the Tinker!</p>

  <p>Alone in that valley of death for a second, his courage deserted him, and
  he felt his hands trembling.</p>

  <p>"No weakness, Danton," he quoted mockingly at himself, and, running across
  the floor of the vale, mounted the slope, his eyes still searching for the
  confetti trail, and went at a jogtrot back the way he had come.</p>

  <p>He had reached the plantation when he felt, rather than saw, the ambush
  into which he was falling. Hampered as he was by the closely growing trees,
  his progress was slow.</p>

  <p><i>Plop!</i></p>

  <p>He had heard that sound before, but this time the bullet missed, and
  snicked the bark of a growing beech, and went, whining and humming, into the
  wood.</p>

  <p>The second shot went even wider, and then he came to a place where the
  trees were less thickly planted, where he had had elbow room and a clear
  throw. He stopped and took a Mills bomb from his pocket, pulled out the pin,
  and as he saw the flash of a third shot, flung it with all his might in the
  direction of the hidden assassin. In another second he was flying like a man
  demented. He judged his time perfectly, and flung himself on the ground only
  the fraction of a moment before the bomb exploded. From somewhere behind he
  heard a shriek, and, rising to his feet, ran swiftly.</p>

  <p>He had missed the trail, but he had a rough idea of direction. Once he
  stopped to take breath, listening intently, but there was no sign of pursuit.
  Ten minutes later he heard voices and footsteps ahead of him, saw a figure
  come into view, and was challenged by a familiar voice.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Bullott&mdash;Holbrook speaking."</p>

  <p>"What was that explosion?" asked Bullott.</p>

  <p>Bill saw that there were three men with him. It was not necessary to ask
  what had brought him here, but the detective volunteered the information.</p>

  <p>"I followed you, of course," he said, "but I lost you in the wood, and I
  didn't realise that they'd laid a trail for you, until one of my men showed
  me the confetti. What was the explosion?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>Bill explained briefly, and together they went back the way he had come.
  They got back to the plantation, and began their search.</p>

  <p>That somebody had been wounded was clear from the bloodstains. Some of the
  dried undergrowth was burning, and this they put out with little difficulty.
  But of the assailant there was no sign.</p>

  <p>Sending one of his men back for an ambulance, the inspector accompanied
  Bill to the hut in the vale. To Bill's surprise the door of the hut was
  locked, and it was an hour before they succeeded, with the help of a ranger,
  in getting the door open. Bullott flashed his lamp inside: it fell upon a
  loose, hanging rope, newly severed. The body of Tinker Lane had
  disappeared!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32"></a>XXXII. &mdash; TOBY MARSH GOES TO A PARTY</h2>

  <p class="first">"IT would take a week's search to find the body," said
  Bullott, as they were driving home together. "There are dozens of pits and
  caves into which they could have thrown him. It was an act of lunacy for you
  to go there at all."</p>

  <p>"You'll pinch Laffin, of course?" said Bill.</p>

  <p>Bullott shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," he answered quietly. "I've no evidence upon which I can arrest
  the doctor. I haven't even got the body. But this I can tell you, that Laffin
  is being watched closer than a fire! There is nothing to do but to wait until
  the rangers discover the body, and that may take weeks. We have one chance of
  connecting Laffin with these crimes. I am taking that chance to-morrow
  night."</p>

  <p>"You mean the raid on the Priory?"</p>

  <p>Bullott nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is no better time. Do you know what happens next week?"</p>

  <p>"The only thing I know that happens next week is that the mysterious
  twenty-ninth of July occurs on Saturday."</p>

  <p>"Next week they declare the Midsummer argosies of the Sons of Ragusa,"
  said Bullott. "That means that the draw takes place either Monday, Tuesday or
  Wednesday.. I guess it is Monday, because your cousin, Mr. Pawter, is
  arranging to leave London for Plymouth by the 10.30 train to-morrow
  morning."</p>

  <p>Bullott was not visible for the rest of the evening. He locked himself up
  in his room and gave himself entirely to the problem of the Sons of Ragusa.
  It was a problem seemingly insoluble. What importance should he give to the
  mysterious hints of Toby Marsh? What could Marsh tell him? His passion for
  secrecy had allowed him only to give the most tantalising glimpses of his
  mind, and toward eleven o'clock Bullott took a sudden decision. He kicked off
  his slippers, pulled on his shoes, and, without saying a word to his lodger,
  who, he knew, was working in his room, went out.</p>

  <p>Soon after midnight a taxi brought him to Robbs Road, and to the house
  which he knew was occupied by the burglar, "Your luck's in," said Toby Marsh,
  who opened the door to him. "Five minutes later, and you'd have missed
  me."</p>

  <p>"Are you going out?" asked Bullott, regarding him with professional
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>"I'm going out, but on a perfectly childlike errand," said Toby Marsh. "In
  fact, I'm going to a party, and if you're a wise man you'll go home, get into
  your glad clothes and join me."</p>

  <p>Toby was wearing an old-fashioned tuxedo, and showed an immense expanse of
  white shirt-front.</p>

  <p>"You look good enough to eat," said Bullott admiringly. "Where are you
  going?"</p>

  <p>"To Madame La Florette, at her palatial home on Portman Place," said Toby.
  "I've had an invitation by card, and I guess Jennie won't object if I bring a
  friend&mdash;Jennie is good English for La Florette. She's a nice girl, but
  somewhat mercenary. Will you come?"</p>

  <p>Bullott's first thought was to decline the invitation.</p>

  <p>"I'll go with you if you'll tell me something I want to know."</p>

  <p>"Make no conditions, my busy friend," said Toby, "I'm offering you the
  experience of a lifetime. What do you want to know?"</p>

  <p>"I want a little more information about Laffin."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you a whole lot," said the other. "Laffin is at this
  moment"&mdash;he looked at his watch&mdash;"interviewing Captain Harvey Hale,
  that queer man of the sea. If you were sitting in his study you'd learn no
  more than I already know, and which I'll tell you in course of time. By the
  way did the impetuous and inexperienced Mr. Holbrook keep his
  appointment?"</p>

  <p>"He did," said the other grimly.</p>

  <p>"And he got back alive. I guessed that because you're not very agitated.
  And did he find Tinker?"</p>

  <p>His keen eyes were fixed on the detective's face.</p>

  <p>"Yes; how did you know?"</p>

  <p>"I guessed. Alive or dead?"</p>

  <p>"Dead," said Bullott, and the other man nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid that was how it would be. It occurred to me this afternoon
  what an excellent opportunity there was for drama in that wood, and there can
  be no doubt about the dramatic instincts of the Ragusas."</p>

  <p>"Marsh, you know a little too much about this business," said Bullott, his
  old suspicions aroused.</p>

  <p>"I'm beginning to think you're right," said Toby, with a sigh. "I found
  myself dreaming about them last night&mdash;the Ragusas, I mean." He looked
  thoughtfully at the detective. "Are you pretty strong?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Fairly," said Bullott.</p>

  <p>"Could you work four hours at a stretch in an atmosphere of a hundred and
  four degrees?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the astounded Bullott.</p>

  <p>"I'm asking you," said the imperturbable burglar. "Would your constitution
  stand up to it?"</p>

  <p>"I think so; I am a fairly healthy man," said Bullott. "But what's the
  mystery? Do you ever speak straight out and say what you mean, Marsh?"</p>

  <p>"Only when I plead not guilty," said Mr. Marsh.</p>

  <p>As Bullott opened the door of his house, Bill Holbrook came to the head of
  the stairs, and was promptly invited to join the party; and, guessing more
  from Marsh's manner than from what he said, Bill, whose inclinations were
  towards bed, changed quickly and joined the little man in Bullott's
  sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"Here's a strange thing, Holbrook," said Toby. "Florette's been in that
  new house of hers about ten minutes. Well, say a couple of days. You wouldn't
  think she'd have got the invitations out so quick, would you, as she has? And
  some swell performers have been engaged. Half the stars at the opera have had
  a hurry-up call, and Bazley's are doing the refreshments. Can you beat
  it?"</p>

  <p>"She asked you, but she didn't ask me; do I get thrown out?"</p>

  <p>"You stick to me, boy," said Toby, "and you'll see something.</p>

  <p>There was very little to see when they reached Portman Place, except
  masses of people. The ballroom was so crowded that dancing was impossible. In
  the big drawing-room, the throng who had gathered to listen to a great
  coloratura bulged out through the doorway into the hall. And the harassed
  servants, newly engaged, challenged neither Toby nor the two people who
  accompanied him.</p>

  <p>Of La Florette there was no sign, but by judicious inquiry Marsh
  discovered that there was a card-room on the ground floor, and it was here
  that he met his hostess and introduced his friends. La Florette favoured him
  with a mechanical smile, and shot a quick, surprised glance from Holbrook to
  the detective.</p>

  <p>"I've seen you somewhere, young man?" she said.</p>

  <p>"A reporter on the <i>Post-Herald</i>," said Toby in a stage whisper. "I
  thought I'd bring him along in case you wanted any publicity."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't," snapped Florette. "I'm very glad to see you, Mr.
  What's-your-name, but I don't want anything about this party to go in the
  newspapers.</p>

  <p>With a nod she passed on to join a grey-haired man, whose eyes had never
  left hen</p>

  <p>"That is Sir Richard Paxton, of the Treasury," said Bill, recognising him.
  "What is he doing in this galley?"</p>

  <p>The superiority of Toby's smile was offensive to a well-informed
  reporter.</p>

  <p>"Paxton has been a front-row lizard at all La Florette's productions for
  the past two years," he said.</p>

  <p>"I've heard that Treasury officials go mad at fifty-five," said Bill.
  "This is one of those cases. I wonder who is paying the bill?"</p>

  <p>Somebody else in the party was pondering that question. Mr. Charles Van
  Campe was amazed, but also alarmed, at the prodigality of the entertainment.
  He waited an opportunity, which was long in coming, to take his friend to the
  little study at the back of the hall which she had reserved for her own use
  that night.</p>

  <p>"Kid, this is fine, but I hope you've so fixed it with Laffin, that
  there's no come-back. Did he give you any money?" She mentioned a sum and he
  whistled.</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't pay the breakage bill," he said. "You want to see him right
  away and get this scheme of his on a proper business basis. A man told me
  yesterday that he's near broke, and I know for a fact that he's only paid a
  deposit on the rent of this house."</p>

  <p>"He will not let me down," she said, but she was a little uneasy. "I'm
  'phoning him to-night&mdash;I was hoping he would come, but he told me he was
  too busy."</p>

  <p>"'Phone him now," urged Van Campe, troubled.</p>

  <p>She locked the door and called Laffin's number.</p>

  <p>"He's probably in bed," she said. "Those kind of men do not keep late
  hours"</p>

  <p>Even as she spoke she heard Laffin's gentle voice.</p>

  <p>"It is La Florette speaking, Doctor," she said in a low voice. "I have the
  information you wanted." And in two sentences she told him all he wished to
  know, though she did not realise this until a long time afterwards. "And
  Doctor, don't you think it would be wise if you let me have some money? The
  five hundred you sent me will not go very far. The band has cost a hundred,
  and the people who supply the refreshments want a cheque to-morrow
  morning."</p>

  <p>"That will be quite in order, Miss Florette," said the soothing voice of
  the doctor. "You need have no apprehension. I will send you a cheque by the
  early morning delivery."</p>

  <p>Before she could urge this need still further, he had switched off.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's that," she said with a sigh of relief. "I don't think you
  need worry, Charles. Now come and meet some of my friends."</p>

  <p>"Who is that queer-looking man in glasses, and the old-fashioned
  suit?"</p>

  <p>"He's a friend of mother's," she said, bitterly regretting that, in a
  moment of expansiveness, induced by Toby Marsh's unblushing flattery, she had
  sent him an invitation at all.</p>

  <p>"I know the reporter who is with him; he ought to be able to get some good
  publicity for you."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Laffin doesn't want a word in the newspapers. Can you beat it?" she
  said, with pardonable exasperation. "I'm supposed to be getting publicity out
  of this stunt of his, and yet not a line must be published!"</p>

  <p>She saw the three standing in the hall together as she went back to the
  ballroom, and observed with satisfaction that Mr. Marsh was being helped into
  his coat.</p>

  <p>Toby was the first to leave, and stood waiting for the other two whilst
  the footman found their belongings. Bill had walked out on to the street, and
  Bullott was following, when he heard the footman say:</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir," and felt in his pocket for a tip. "Can I have a word
  with you?"</p>

  <p>The detective looked at the servant in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes, certainly," he said.</p>

  <p>The footman came with him to the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>"You don't know me, sir, but I know you. You're Mr. Bullott of
  Headquarters, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"That is so," said Bullott, as the man made a sign. "You're a Ragusa?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted to talk to you about that," the man went on. "I was at the lodge
  when you were initiated. You wouldn't know me, because I was one of the two
  men who put on your robes."</p>

  <p>Bullott remembered the two attendants in the ante-room who had assisted
  himself and Bill Holbrook to don the livery of the Proud Sons.</p>

  <p>"What I wanted to ask you, sir, was this," said the man, lowering his
  voice and glancing back at the open door. "Do you think everything is all
  square and above-board with the Ragusas? It used to be," he went on quickly.
  "When I joined the order, about ten years ago, it was one of the most
  brotherly societies you could wish for. And don't think, sir, that I'm trying
  to knock the order because they put me down from the Twenty-Third and made me
  a small lodge member. We don't mind that, because it has happened to so many
  of us, and, after all, it's an honour to have been up above at all."</p>

  <p>"You were a Twenty-Third Degree-er, were you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I was a member of the Twenty-Third Degree for five years, until
  I got the order from the Worshipful Master that I was to return to the lower
  lodge. As I say, there's nothing in that, but what I can't understand is the
  queer birds who are taking our place."</p>

  <p>"Where does the Twenty-Third Degree meet?"</p>

  <p>The man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"That's a thing I'm not supposed to tell you, sir, but as I've said so
  much, I might as well say a little more. They work the degree at the Deptford
  Lodge. As a matter of fact, there isn't a Deptford Lodge at all, for although
  it is supposed to be just an ordinary lodge, only Twenty-Third Degree men are
  members."</p>

  <p>"What kind of fellows are being initiated into the Twenty-Third?"</p>

  <p>"The scum of the earth," said the man emphatically. "If they'd raked the
  mud of the Thames, they couldn't have got up worse specimens! There isn't a
  riverside thief that hasn't been initiated. The proper number for the
  Twenty-Third is fifty members, but now there must be a hundred."</p>

  <p>"Give me the address of the lodge-room," said Bullott, and scribbled it
  down on his shirt-cuff.</p>

  <p>"You don't mind me telling you this?" asked the footman anxiously. "I feel
  I'm betraying the Order, and the Ragusas do queer things to people who talk
  too much."</p>

  <p>"You can trust me," said Bullott. "If it is any satisfaction to you, I
  will tell you that the Twenty-Third Degree is very much under suspicion."</p>

  <p>He said good-night to the footman and walked quickly after his two
  companions, who were slowly pacing towards Oxford Circus.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Yellowplush is one of your men, I suppose?" said Toby Marsh, and
  Bullott did not correct that mistaken impression.</p>

  <p>Mr. Toby Marsh did not return to his lodgings, but pursued his way to the
  Camden Road. Not a hundred yards from Dr. Laffin's house was a group of small
  shops huddled together as though in fear of the encroachments of their more
  pretentious neighbours. Each had its narrow front, its small side door which
  led to the regions above, and in the lock of one of these, Mr. Marsh inserted
  a key and passed through.</p>

  <p>At the end of the cramped passage a flight of stairs led to the upper
  floors. He did not stop until he reached the poorly furnished attic room
  which he had rented a few weeks before. Lighting the gas, he pulled down the
  window shade carefully, and care was needed, for through the open window top
  trailed a wire which ran to a small box and a pair of headphones that stood
  on the wash-stand.</p>

  <p>When he had excluded himself from chance observation, he pulled up a
  chair, and, fixing the receivers to his ear, sat down to listen. What he
  heard was apparently all-engrossing, for he did not stir for an hour except
  to jot down a note or two on the writing-pad which lay convenient to his
  hand. At the end of the hour, he took off his 'phones and, rising, stretched
  himself.</p>

  <p>From the bottom of a cupboard he took out a small, leather case, opened it
  and removed one by one the instruments of his craft, delicate little tools,
  larger ones, ingeniously devised and fitting together by clamps and screws,
  keys of unusual pattern, saws of strange shape&mdash;he laid them on the bed
  and surveyed them with a speculative eye.</p>

  <p>Looking out of the window, he saw, to his surprise, that the sky was going
  grey, and this fact apparently brought about an alteration of his plans, for
  he replaced the tools one by one, and five minutes later was walking briskly
  down Camden Road. A plain-clothes patrol saw his gleaming spectacles, noted
  the handbag he carried, and turned toward him.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Toby."</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Sergeant."</p>

  <p>Toby stopped.</p>

  <p>"Early to rise, wealthy and wise," said the detective. "Got a crop of
  early worms in that little bag of yours?" Without a word Toby handed over the
  bag, and without a word the officer opened and searched. He found nothing but
  a dozen folders dealing with the joys and comforts of Atlantic travel.</p>

  <p>"Thinking of going abroad, Toby?" he smiled, as he snapped the bag close
  and handed it back.</p>

  <p>"Yep. My doctor has recommended a sea voyage."</p>

  <p>"You've found a nice boat&mdash;the <i>Escorial.</i> I almost thought
  you'd been smashing a shipping office when I saw those folders." The
  detective was still in doubt, and, putting down his bag, Toby Marsh extended
  his arms.</p>

  <p>"Run me over, son&mdash;you're itching to do it, and I'm in a hurry."</p>

  <p>The officer's palms ran lightly over Toby Marsh from shoulder to knee.</p>

  <p>"Clean bill," he said. "Sorry to pull you up, but there's something very
  sinister about early rising. Good morning."</p>

  <p>"Good morning."</p>

  <p>Toby passed on without annoyance. The officer had not searched his hat, in
  the lining of which were three small keys, two of which gave him the entrance
  to Dr. Laffin's house, and the other to the last place in the world that even
  Bullott would have imagined.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33"></a>XXXIII. &mdash; THE LISTENER IN THE CHIMNEY</h2>

  <p class="first">DR. LAFFIN had spent the greater part of the evening with a
  companion who, aesthetically, was repugnant to him, but in other ways was a
  wholly desirable associate. He finished his short conversation with La
  Florette, pushed aside the telephone and, leaning back in his chair, watched
  his guest pull the cork from a second large bottle and pour the yellow,
  bubbling fluid into a large wine-glass that stood on the edge of the writing
  desk.</p>

  <p>Captain Harvey Hale was a man of no particular reticence, and not even the
  somewhat chilling atmosphere of that dark study, nor the eerie references
  which the doctor made to unseen presences, dulled his geniality in such
  moments as these.</p>

  <p>"Land work," he said, smacking his lips, "or sea work, it's all one to
  Harvey Hale. You can't help accidents, or, as we call them at sea, the acts
  of God, and you can't stop men like this blooming Holbrook wriggling out of a
  trap, it doesn't matter how clever you are. Personally, I think it's a waste
  of time bothering with a whippersnapper like that&mdash;a man I could break
  in two across my knee." He lifted his glass. "To the sunny islands and
  lashings of money!"</p>

  <p>He drained its contents at a gulp without taking the vessel from his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't have come to a better man than me, Commodore," he said,
  nodding his head slowly. "If you'd searched the wide world you couldn't have
  found a better man! On land or on sea, by flood and by field"</p>

  <p>"You have spoken to the men?"</p>

  <p>"Spoken to them?" The room shook with the sea captain's laughter. "You
  don't want to speak to that kind of cattle; you just give them an order and
  that's enough. They know me; there isn't a sailorman that's shipped before
  the mast who doesn't know Harvey 'Ale."</p>

  <p>In his cups the captain was inclined to take liberties with the English
  language.</p>

  <p>"They're ripe and willing. They know there's a big job ahead, and they're
  ready to do it. What is it, Doctor?" His voice assumed a wheedling tone.
  "You're going to tell old Skipper Hale all about it?"</p>

  <p>"You'll know in good time," said Laffin. "It may not be necessary:
  everything depends upon to-morrow, my good friend. In my life I have had one
  very grave disappointment, the gravest that any man could face. That a second
  should await me seems incredible, and yet there is that possibility."</p>

  <p>His visitor growled something under his breath.</p>

  <p>"I hope you're disappointed, that's all," he said.</p>

  <p>"That is, if it gives a chance to Harvey Hale to do something big. What
  are you going to do about that girl?" Dr. Laffin's lips pressed tightly
  together, but he did not answer.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't my fault that we didn't get her the second time. I got her
  first time all right, didn't I? Why didn't you keep her? That was your fault?
  How was I to know that they'd got a 'busy' downstairs sleeping on the
  premises?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not blaming you," said the doctor in his mincing way. "Believe me, I
  do not blame you. The fates were not propitious. My supreme genius, the
  mighty Kemelsina, master of my destiny"&mdash;he waved an airy hand to the
  cornice, and instinctively Hale looked up as though he expected to find a
  material manifestation&mdash;"my great exemplar was not in sympathy with the
  movement." Before him was spread a double sheet of foolscap, and once more he
  adjusted his horn-rimmed glasses, and with his finger moving down each line
  of writing, he perused the document from beginning to end in silence, whilst
  Hale watched him impatiently.</p>

  <p>"You have sent the first party away?" asked Laffin, looking up.</p>

  <p>"They've arrived. I had a cable from them this morning," said Hale, "ready
  and willing and hearty."</p>

  <p>"Who has the sealed envelope?"</p>

  <p>"Collinson's in charge," said Harvey Hale. "He's a good seaman and knows
  all about sealed orders. You can trust him, Commodore. I've told him if he
  breaks the seal I'll break his head! He knows me&mdash;sailed with me a dozen
  times. When Harvey Hale says he'll break a man's head, by God, it's as good
  as broken! I'm that way, Commodore. My word's as good as a lawyer's
  agreement, stamped and sealed. There ain't a man from Shanghai to Valp'riso
  that doesn't know that when I say a thing I mean it. I tell you, you've got a
  big man on your side when you've got Harvey Hale. And remember this
  "&mdash;he leant across the table, his bloated face within a few inches of
  the doctor's&mdash;"when it comes out, when the news goes all over the world
  what has happened, people will say, 'Harvey Hale! Nobody else could have done
  it but that big guy!' And I'm a dead man if they catch me!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said Laffin testily. "I suppose in your brutal way you have
  the elements of greatness. I am large enough to recognise your claims. But
  behind this scheme is a mentality beyond your understanding, a genius outside
  the range of your comprehension. You are an instrument, Captain, please
  remember that; merely the instrument, that is wielded by my gigantic
  intellect."</p>

  <p>"We are two big men together," said Captain Hale comfortably. "Put it
  there, Commodore!"</p>

  <p>Dr. Laffin ignored the extended hand.</p>

  <p>"Now go home, my friend. I think you have drunk enough. From now on you
  keep sober&mdash;you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Drink has never meant anything to me," said the captain, rising, and
  considering the quantity he had consumed that evening, both his speech and
  his poise were extraordinarily steady. "I could drink a distillery dry and
  walk a chalk line. Ask any man you've ever met who knows the sea, has he ever
  seen Harvey Hale drunk? What will they answer?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Laffin did not trouble to inquire. He walked suggestively into the
  passage, opened the front door, and cut short a further panegyric on the
  merits and qualities of Harvey Hale by closing the door gently in the face of
  that worthy man.</p>

  <p>He did not return to his study, but went upstairs to the top floor, where
  he had imprisoned Betty Carew. The door which Holbrook had broken had been
  repaired, and fastened even more securely. He was in the "suite" for ten
  minutes before he came back to the study. A somewhat tidy minded man, he
  gathered together a number of notes he had made, examined them one by one,
  and finally, after half an hour's memorising, carried the scraps of paper to
  the fireplace, struck a match and lit them. As they blazed up, a puff of
  smoke came out into the room; it was as though the chimney was blocked. He
  stooped and looked up. Concealed from view by the edge of the fireplace, and
  half-resting on a brick projection, was a small black box.</p>

  <p>He stamped out the paper fire, reached up and tried to pull it down, but
  it was fastened to something. He pulled with all his strength; there was a
  snap, and the box came away in his hand.</p>

  <p>Now he saw what had held it in place: a long strand of wire, which he had
  snapped. The box, which was black with soot and had evidently been lowered
  down the chimney, was about six inches square, and roughly made. He put it on
  his table and examined it curiously; then, with the aid of a pair of
  scissors, he ripped off one side, and had no need to look further to discover
  the significance of his find. It was a sensitive microphone.</p>

  <p>For a second his face went grey. Who had placed it there? What had been
  heard?</p>

  <p>He passed out of the room, up the stairs, and through the locked door of
  the top floor suite. In a locked lumber-room at the back of the house was a
  small trap-door that led to the roof, which served as an emergency fire
  escape. In five minutes he was walking along the flat roof until he was
  brought up by a high chimney stack.</p>

  <p>Yes, there it was&mdash;from one of the chimney pots a length of wire led
  across the root and down one side of the house. To make any further search
  that night was impracticable. The mischief was done. What should he do?</p>

  <p>He sat until dawn showed, his malignant eyes fixed upon the telltale
  instrument, and then, with some labour, he replaced the box where he had
  found it and made a rough splice of the broken wire. Whoever was listening
  should hear something a little more puzzling than they had heard before.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34"></a>XXXIV. &mdash; MR. PAWTER EXPLAINS</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. PAWTER was in his office when Bill called. He was
  reading a newspaper, whistling softly the while, a practice peculiar to men
  of an equable temperament.</p>

  <p>"The return of the wanderer," he murmured. "Please tell the cashier to
  have the fatted calf slaughtered with appropriate ceremony. You will find
  your room in order, and your desk so innocent of muddle that you will hardly
  feel at home for a day or two. And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pips, I want a story out of you," said Bill, seating himself on the other
  side of the table.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pawter laid down his newspaper and sighed.</p>

  <p>"You are still engaged in the profession from which I rescued you?" he
  asked wearily. "And you want a story? I should be false to the traditions of
  my agency if I missed a chance of getting good publicity. What is the story?
  Does it pay to advertise? Yes, it does."</p>

  <p>"Pips," interrupted Bill again, "the story I want is about a priory and a
  Seen Prior."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pawter eyed him steadily.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly the kind of story I can't give you," he said, "not for
  publication anyway."</p>

  <p>"I don't want it for publication. I want to know what you are in this
  outfit."</p>

  <p>"You seem to know already," Mr. Pawter smiled faintly. "I am a
  Prior&mdash;in other words, I am the accountant of the Proud Sons of Ragusa.
  You didn't know that I was an accountant? Accountancy was my long suit, and I
  am a member of the Chartered Society. There is nothing mysterious about me,
  William. I am surprised you should have imagined there was."</p>

  <p>"Did you know Brother John?"</p>

  <p>Pawter's face became instantly grave.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I knew him," he said quietly. And then, after long reflection: "I'd
  better tell you the story of my connection with this society. The head of the
  Ragusas, as you probably know, is Mr. Leiff Stone. Ragusa, as you will know
  if any of your school learning remains, was at one time the richest town in
  Dalmatia, the port from which the argosies sailed&mdash;'argosy' means
  literally 'a vessel of Ragusa.' Many years ago I was associated with Stone in
  business, and when he had got the Order running, and his prize scheme had
  caught on to such an extent that members were flocking into the Order, he
  sent for me and asked if I would put it upon a proper business basis.
  Naturally, it was not the kind of thing which greatly interested
  me&mdash;secret societies and all that sort of stuff&mdash;but there were
  very many reasons why I should take up the work. In the first place, two
  thousand a year"</p>

  <p>"Dollars?" asked Bill.</p>

  <p>"I am speaking of our own depleted currency," said Mr. Pawter. "No, two
  thousand pounds was the salary offered to me, and a very acceptable sum it
  was. I did not like the lottery idea very much; as a business man it had no
  appeal for me, and, moreover, it struck me that it erred on the side of
  illegality. However, the police seemed satisfied that the Ragusas should have
  their argosies, and who am I to oppose my opinion to the law officers of the
  Crown? I undertook the work, but on the understanding that I should not be
  one of the masks. I drew the line at hiding a countenance which in my youth
  was not without its admirers."</p>

  <p>"That must have been a hell of a long time ago," said the irritated Bill.
  "Can't you make the story short?"</p>

  <p>"It's going to be just as short as I can make it," replied Mr. Pawter
  complacently. "As I say, I stipulated that I should not be masked, and I
  pointed out to Leiff Stone the extraordinary opportunities that existed in
  the Order for impersonation and fraud, unless there was one man whom
  everybody knew by sight, and who could be distinguished from the rest of the
  crowd. He fell in with my views, and ever since it has been my duty to draw
  the numbers which bring fortune to members of the Order."</p>

  <p>"Just a minute," interrupted Bill. "The revenue of the Ragusas is a pretty
  heavy one, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It has a turnover of something between six hundred and seven hundred
  thousand pounds a year," was the staggering reply, "and half of that goes in
  argosies&mdash;nearly half."</p>

  <p>"Now is it possible," said Bill, "for a swindler to obtain admission to
  the Priory, and, by impersonating one or the other officers, secure a hold of
  that money?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely impossible," said Pawter emphatically, and Bill showed his
  surprise. "The grafter who tried that would get the shock of his life.
  Nobody, not even the Grand Prior himself, can touch any of the money, and
  certainly cannot touch the prize money. I will explain the system. When a man
  is initiated into the Proud Sons of Ragusa, he pays ten dollars; he pays
  another ten dollars every year. Half of that money is banked by the local
  lodge in what is known as 'A' account, with the London, Southern &amp;
  Northern Bank. That is, in fact, the prize fund, which is only released to
  the men who win the argosies, on a cheque signed by me and initialled by the
  Grand Prior. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>Bill nodded.</p>

  <p>"Of the other pound&mdash;the other half of your subscription that is to
  say&mdash;a proportion is retained for working expenses of the lodge, and the
  remainder, a definite sum, is remitted to the Grand Priory. It is, I might
  tell you, a very insignificant amount&mdash;I refer to the amount that goes
  to headquarters&mdash;just sufficient to keep the Priory running, with very
  little surplus, and it is known as the Prior's Tax. So obviously there is
  nothing to be gained from getting control of the Priory. The only big stuff
  that is handled is the Argosy Fund, which is never really in the Prior's
  hands."</p>

  <p>"What about the Twenty-Third Degree?"</p>

  <p>"That also has a small income," nodded Pawter, "and the Grand Lodge is in
  the same case&mdash;there are no surpluses."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it possible to fake the draw?"</p>

  <p>Pawter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I draw the numbers, bare-armed. There are really five draws," he
  explained, "and the Priors, who sit in council beforehand, decide which of
  the five shall be the 'true draw.' So I am absolutely in ignorance as to
  which they will decide upon, and I could not fake if I wanted to. The five
  numbers, or the five groups of numbers, are written down, and then the Priors
  tell me which of the groups is the 'true draw,' and there is nothing more for
  me to do but to turn up the names that correspond with the numbers and
  forward the cheques."</p>

  <p>Bill sat with a puzzled frown on his face.</p>

  <p>"The more businesslike the Ragusas become, the more mysterious they are!"
  he, said. "There doesn't seem to be a foothold for a crook, unless the crook
  happens to be you."</p>

  <p>He looked suspiciously at his relative, but Mr. Pawter, who was inured to
  such veiled insults, was more amused than annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Even I haven't much of a chance," he began.</p>

  <p>"Tell me one thing: have you ever seen Leiff Stone's face since he became
  a Prior?"</p>

  <p>Pawter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I know him only by his purple gown. If I met him to-day in the street I
  should not recognise him."</p>

  <p>"Who was Brother John?"</p>

  <p>"Brother John was the Grand Prior's assistant, and was the only parson in
  the bunch."</p>

  <p>"What is there concealed at the Priory?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Pawter emphatically. "I know the Priory from gate to
  cellar. I know every cell in it, every inch of it, and I tell you that if
  there's anything more innocent than a Prior of the Proud Sons of Ragusa, why,
  it ought to wear a halo!"</p>

  <p>Poor Bullott, thought Bill! The raid was abortive before it was made. But
  he could not tell the inspector this or take the responsibility for checking
  his plans.</p>

  <p>"Have you the least suspicion of an idea in your mind why Brother John was
  murdered?"</p>

  <p>Pawter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not the least. He was a man without enemies, a man who had no private
  feuds; beyond his devotion to Stone, I know of no very great friendship of
  his. The murder is inexplicable, and I can only suppose that the shot fired
  at Brother John was either intended for somebody else, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't say it was an accident," said Bill, "because that kind of accident
  hardly happens twice in twenty-four hours. The man who shot Brother John took
  one good crack at me, and nearly got me."</p>

  <p>"There are certain advantages in having a small head," murmured Mr. Pawter
  as he closed the door upon his sometime assistant.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35"></a>XXXV. &mdash; THE PRIORY</h2>

  <p class="first">AT six o'clock that summer evening a station taxi dropped
  Mr. Pawter at the Two Bridges Hotel, an ancient hostelry set in the heart of
  Dartmoor. He paid the driver and watched the machine grow smaller and smaller
  on the long road that led to Newton Abbot, and then he went into the hotel,
  engaged a room and ordered his meal. He was evidently no stranger to the
  place, for the old waiter greeted him as a friend.</p>

  <p>"Going up to see them Priors to-night, sir?" he asked the identical
  question that he had asked some twenty times before, and Mr. Pawter gave him
  the conventional answer. "They've been busy up at the Priory lately," said
  the old man as he laid the cloth. "I don't remember when we've seen so many
  people going and coming. Motor cars all hours of the day and night. And
  somebody's been sick there, too: I saw an ambulance going up&mdash;when was
  it? Must have been last week sometime. I've got a cottage right on the road,"
  said the garrulous old gentleman, pausing with his hands full of knives and
  forks and tableware. "You can't go to the Priory without passing me. And what
  with my rheumatics, I haven't been sleeping as well as I might. As you might
  say, my cottage is a sort of a lodge for the Priory. Monks, ain't they,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>"Sort of monks," said Pawter.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what good they get out of shutting themselves up all their
  lives, but they're as close as oysters. You never see any of them down here,
  not even the lay brothers. That seems queer to me!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pawter listened with the amused air of one who was indulging a child,
  and after he had been served with his meal, changed into a golf suit, and,
  with a walking stick in his hand, strolled out on to the moor, striking
  across the gaunt countryside towards a smaller road which he knew ran
  parallel with the post-road.</p>

  <p>It was his wont on such excursions to delight his mind with thoughts upon
  the strange men who in past days had traversed this bleak moorland; the tin
  merchants of Phoenicia, the adventurers of Rome, whose feet had worn the
  paths which were now the broad arteries of traffic. But on this occasion his
  mind was too greatly occupied by other matters to find room for historical
  reflection.</p>

  <p>He was a mile from his objective when he saw the waiting car, a small
  American machine that was invariably employed to take him to the Priory. The
  elderly man at the wheel touched his cap as Pawter came up. He wore the blue
  serge suit which was the livery of all the workers at the Priory, and Pawter
  knew him by name.</p>

  <p>"All well at the Priory?" he asked, as he stepped into the machine by the
  driver's side.</p>

  <p>"All well, sir," said the old man.</p>

  <p>"Nobody been ill?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the other in surprise, "not that I know."</p>

  <p>They proceeded for a mile in silence, and then Pawter asked:</p>

  <p>"How is the Grand Prior?"</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir, so far as I know. We never see much of him. He doesn't
  come through the main gates."</p>

  <p>Pawter nodded. He was the only prior that ever went through the main
  gates. There was, in one corner of the wall, a small portal which was known
  as the Prior's Door, and had been used for hundreds of years for the
  convenience of the superior of that order which the Proud Sons of Ragusa had
  replaced.</p>

  <p>"He comes and goes by night, as you know, sir," said the driver. "As a
  matter of fact, all the brethren do but you. I hope there's going to be a bit
  of luck for my lodge this drawing," he added. "We haven't had an argosy come
  to Plymouth so long as I can remember. Little prizes, but none of the big
  ones. And it's curious that we never get them at the Priory&mdash;none of the
  lay brothers, I mean."</p>

  <p>"Your number goes in with the rest," said Pawter good-humouredly. He had
  listened to this complaint ever since he had been associated with the
  order.</p>

  <p>Every lodge had a mild grievance that the argosies came a little too
  infrequently in their direction. The provincial branches were certain that
  London got more than its share;</p>

  <p>London pointed dolefully to the scarcity of prizes awarded to Metropolitan
  lodges.</p>

  <p>The car dipped into a valley, turned abruptly round a great stone tor,
  through another valley, and then on the left, between the secondary and the
  main road, Pawter saw the familiar lines of the Priory, squat, unlovely, so
  much a part of the moor in colour and cheerlessness that a stranger might
  pass it by without knowing that the Priory existed. The walls were high and
  grey, overgrown with ivy and other creeping plants. The great gates, which
  swung open at their approach, always reminded him of a prison. But inside he
  came upon peace. A great garden, beautiful to the eye, and, in the cool of
  the evening, fragrant beyond description. Pillared cloisters, dark and cool,
  stone-flagged paths, patiently tended. A very haven of peace and
  quietude.</p>

  <p>Pawter got down and followed the silent attendant through a small doorway
  and along a stone passage, at the end of which the man opened an uninviting
  door that looked more like the door of a cell than of the handsome suite it
  was. The open grate was banked high with flowers; the floor was covered with
  a thick carpet, and the furnishing of the apartment, though severe, was
  luxurious.</p>

  <p>From this room there was an opening, unfurnished with door, into the
  bedroom. It was a typical suite of the silent Priors of Ragusa. The
  bookshelves which half-covered one stone wall were well-filled.</p>

  <p>"Hall is at eight, sir," said the attendant.</p>

  <p>He wore the conventional garb of the Sons of Ragusa, save that his head
  was not covered, his hood hanging at his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You will dine?"</p>

  <p>"I have dined," said Pawter. "Is the Prior well?"</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir. He has been away, but he came back this morning."</p>

  <p>He opened a cupboard, took out a decanter, a glass and a large siphon of
  soda, and placed on the table a big box of cigars.</p>

  <p>"You will ring if you require me, sir?" he said, and went out.</p>

  <p>Pawter chose a cigar with care, lit it, and, after smoking thoughtfully
  for a while, he strolled across to the barred window that looked out upon a
  smaller courtyard. Beyond this, through a big gateway, he saw a flower-grown
  expanse, with little mounds set at regular intervals, each surmounted by a
  black cross. Here lay the ancient monks who had died in the service of their
  order, before the Proud Sons of Ragusa had taken over their sacred plot.
  Almost in the centre of his vision, above one large grave, was a large
  Calvary, and Pawter fixed his eyes on this and stared for a long time.</p>

  <p>He was trying to analyse the feeling of uneasiness which clouded his mind.
  It was novel; never before had he felt quite the same as he did to-day. There
  was something... what was it? Could it be William Holbrook's inquisitiveness
  of the morning? Or was his conscience pricking him, that he had revealed so
  much that had never been told before about the internal economy of the Proud
  Sons of Ragusa? Or was it that, stalking in that quiet place was the ghost of
  Brother John, stricken down in his prime in the crowded streets of
  London?</p>

  <p>"I think I must be getting old," he said to himself as he came back and,
  pulling up a chair to the table, took from his pocket a number of papers
  which he had brought with him.</p>

  <p>He had hardly begun their examination when there was a gentle knock at the
  door and a lay brother came in, a redfaced, good-looking man, almost as bald
  as Pawter. He crossed the "cell" and shook hands with the publicity man.</p>

  <p>"They told me you were here," he said, in that low voice which was
  habitual amongst the people of the Priory. "I thought I'd see you and tell
  you the news. You know poor Brother John is dead?"</p>

  <p>Pawter nodded.</p>

  <p>"We only heard to-day, but the Prior has known for some time."</p>

  <p>He was the seneschal of the Priory, a man named Blackwood, whom Pawter had
  known for many years as the head of the laymen. The Ragusas paid their
  permanent officials well, and Blackwood, who occupied something of the
  position of housekeeper to the Priors, found the life so much to his liking
  that he, who had come to what he thought would be a temporary appointment,
  had held his position for fifteen years. Most of the laymen had been
  recruited in exactly the same way. Blackwood had been an hotel manager, who
  had fallen on evil times when the Grand Prior had discovered him. All the
  gardeners and cooks were chosen from the lodges after a careful inquiry into
  their qualifications. These laymen were the veritable masters of the Priory,
  since the Priors themselves had no permanent habitation. Some stayed less
  than a year and were replaced by fresh appointments. Nobody except Brother
  John had remained since the Priors' Degree had been founded.</p>

  <p>"Who has taken the place of Brother John?" asked Pawter.</p>

  <p>"Brother James, a very quiet and pious man," was the reply. "You've come,
  of course, for the drawing?"</p>

  <p>Pawter nodded.</p>

  <p>"I often wonder they haven't made you a Prior, Blackwood?"</p>

  <p>The seneschal smiled.</p>

  <p>"I prefer my position," he said promptly. "To live apart, to let no man
  see your face, to speak to none, spend one's time in contemplation&mdash;no,
  thank you!"</p>

  <p>"You're a mixed lot," said the irreverent Pawter, pulling at his cigar,
  and Blackwood smiled.</p>

  <p>"There are a few not as great gentlemen as the others," he said
  diplomatically. "Some of them cannot stand the life, and want to leave at the
  end of the first week. But they're scared of the Grand Prior. Some would stay
  for years, and are quite upset when they're turned out to make room for
  newcomers. Do you know, Mr. Pawter, that I haven't seen a Prior's face all
  the time I've been here, except one who died?"</p>

  <p>"What do you do for a doctor, in case anybody gets ill?" asked Pawter
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"If a man gets ill he's sent home," said the other. "The only real case of
  illness we've had was a year ago, when the Grand Prior was seized with a
  heart attack. Unfortunately, the only man here who can drive a car was ill,
  and two of the brethren had to go out on to the road in the hope of stopping
  a car bound for Newton Abbot. By great good luck, they managed to hold a car
  that was carrying a doctor to Exeter."</p>

  <p>Pawter blinked quickly.</p>

  <p>"How long ago was this?"</p>

  <p>"A year ago."</p>

  <p>"You don't happen to know the doctor?"</p>

  <p>Blackwood shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, he was admitted by the Prior's Postern. At that time the Grand Prior
  was very ill indeed, and on the verge of delirium. It was Brother John who
  went out to find him. Brother John was beside himself."</p>

  <p>"A year ago"&mdash;Pawter pinched his lower lip&mdash;"and you found a
  doctor, eh?" He drew a long breath. "That explains a lot&mdash;a whole
  lot."</p>

  <p>The seneschal tugged a watch from under his long robe.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to get ready, sir," he said, opening the cupboard, and took
  out a silken gown, as Pawter stripped his coat. "You ought to be thankful
  that you don't have to hide your face either. It must be stifling on a hot
  night like this. Now I must go. You have everything you want?"</p>

  <p>Pawter walked to the door and watched him go down the passage out of
  sight, and came back into the room with a new problem to ponder.</p>

  <p>It was five minutes to eight o'clock when the summons came. He heard the
  shuffle of sandalled feet on the stone flooring of the passage, and there
  came a peculiar knock at his door.</p>

  <p>"Who knocks?" he asked loudly.</p>

  <p>"Two Priors of this Proud Order," came the deep reply.</p>

  <p>"Enter," he said, and the door opened slowly.</p>

  <p>Standing in the opening was a masked and cowled figure, its hands
  concealed in the deep openings of its sleeves. Beyond him was another,
  similarly attired, and without a word the two men turned and paced leisurely
  down the corridor, and Pawter followed. When they reached the courtyard where
  he had got out of the car there was no sign of any layman. They processed
  along a broad garden path, nodding flowers to left and right, through an
  archway, up a short flight of steps, and along another path, until they came
  to the carved door of a building. Here his conductors stood, one on each
  side, and allowed him to pass.</p>

  <p>He was in a small chapel familiar to him. Only the choir was occupied, and
  in the space where ordinarily worshippers would have knelt or sat, was a big
  barrel with a handle attached to one end, and a large table piled high with
  small white, metal-edged discs. His guides passed him, one walking to the
  right and one to the left, and sat down at the end of the choir stalls.</p>

  <p>The mellow light of sunset, streaming through the stained-glass windows,
  brought a new glory to the banners above the choir, gave a newer dignity to
  the slim, violet-clad figure which moved down the chancel steps towards
  him.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, O Seen Prior!" said a muffled voice behind the cowl. "All
  matters being in order, let the illusion of fortune come to whomsoever chance
  shall will."</p>

  <p>There was a silver gilt shovel like a sugar scoop on the table, and with
  the aid of this Pawter shovelled the discs into the barrel until every one
  was inside. Then he clamped tight the lid, and, rolling his sleeve to his
  right shoulder, held up his bare arm, his fingers outstretched. Then, without
  a word, he spun the barrel, and, when it stopped, opened a little trap-door
  in its side, put in his hand and took out a disc, laying it on the table. Ten
  times he did this, and then the Grand Prior pointed to two of the masked
  figures in the stalls and they came down to the table, and as one called the
  numbers the other wrote them down.</p>

  <p>When they had finished, Pawter swept the little discs into the palm of his
  hand and dropped them into the barrel. Again the barrel spun, again he drew
  forth, one by one, ten numbers, and laid them on the table. The two men who
  examined the first had returned to their stalls, and now the Prior pointed to
  two others, who moved forward, called and checked the numbers, and returned
  to their places.</p>

  <p>Five times this happened, and when it was finished, the Grand Prior
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"The fourth drawing is the true drawing, by order of the Priors."</p>

  <p>Pawter checked the numbers carefully, and as he was doing so, the Priors
  rose, a deep voice began the chant of victory, and they filed out one by
  one.</p>

  <p>He frowned. What did that mean? Never before had the Priors left their
  stalls until the names of the winners had been announced.</p>

  <p>As though divining his thoughts, the man in purple spoke:</p>

  <p>"It is not seemly that names should be given, for who knows what envy they
  may excite? And is not envy the very foulest of all human vices? Come with
  me, my brother, to the registry."</p>

  <p>Pawter followed, alert, suspicious.</p>

  <p>The registry was a small, lofty room, where, behind steel doors, were the
  records of the Order. The only light admitted was through a narrow window
  placed near the ceiling and heavily barred, and a swinging kerosene lamp
  supplied the illumination of the apartment. It seemed to Pawter that the lamp
  was turned unusually low.</p>

  <p>"Will you sit on the other side of the table, Mr. Pawter?" said the voice
  of the masked man courteously.</p>

  <p>He turned, opened the safe, and took out, not the books that Pawter
  expected, the register of names and numbers. Instead, he opened a thin
  blotter and exposed to the astonished eyes of the auditor five cheques,
  already filled.</p>

  <p>"You will sign these."</p>

  <p>"But, Grand Prior," protested Pawter, "I have not checked the names with
  the numbers. How did you know that those men would win the argosy?"</p>

  <p>"You will sign those cheques&mdash;please," said the voice again.</p>

  <p>"I'll do nothing of the sort," said Pawter, jumping to his feet. "What
  possesses you, Mr. Stone?"</p>

  <p>The figure raised his hand.</p>

  <p>"There is no name here for me but Grand Prior," he said. "Sign!"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I cannot." Pawter threw down the pen he had taken up and was
  moving away from the table, when:</p>

  <p>"If you value your life, sign!"</p>

  <p>He turned his head: he was looking into the muzzle of an automatic pistol,
  and the fire in the eyes that showed through the cowl blazed balefully.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36"></a>XXXVI. &mdash; THE GRAND PRIOR SHOWS HIS HAND</h2>

  <p class="first">"WHAT does this mean?"</p>

  <p>"It means that you are going to sign five cheques," was the suave reply.
  "Or that you will not leave the Priory alive."</p>

  <p>Slowly Pawter took off his robe, dropped it on the ground, and thrust his
  hands into his pockets. Bald, middle-aged, a creature of commerce, he had in
  him a something which brought a clearer light to his eye and a more
  determined thrust to his jaw.</p>

  <p>"I'll sign nothing," he said. "You are not Leiff Stone!"</p>

  <p>Then, before the other realised what he was doing, Pawter had leapt at the
  man with the pistol. One hand had gripped the wrist, the other was clawing at
  the mask on the face, when something struck him and he went down in a
  heap.</p>

  <p>When he came to himself, he was sitting in a smaller and even darker room,
  on a stone bench. Whatever ventilation there was came through a small grating
  which showed no light. His wrists were fastened with handcuffs, his ankles
  were strapped, and somebody was holding him in the angle of the wall.</p>

  <p>"Wake up."</p>

  <p>He looked stupidly at the purple cowl.</p>

  <p>"You're not Leiff Stone," he said drowsily.</p>

  <p>"You will be a sensible man and sign the cheques," was the reply.</p>

  <p>The Grand Prior was alone, but the heavy door was ajar, and Pawter saw the
  shadow of a second man in the adjoining room.</p>

  <p>"We may have to keep you here for a few days, but I swear that you'll come
  to no harm if you'll do as you're told."</p>

  <p>"I'll sign no cheques," said the other doggedly, "and I warn you that, if
  you attempt to forge my name, you will be instantly detected. The Prior and I
  agreed upon a secret marking to every cheque that the bank manager knows. If
  you're the Prior, you will know what that is."</p>

  <p>For a second the man was taken aback.</p>

  <p>"I know everything," he said, and then unexpectedly left the room,
  slamming the door behind him, leaving his prisoner in darkness.</p>

  <p>It must have been two hours before he returned. He brought back with him a
  jug of water, poured out a glassful, and the prisoner drank eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Pawter, you will be a wise man if you will do as I ask. I know
  the secret mark&mdash;a dot under the vowel of every recipent's name. You are
  mistaken in thinking that I am not Stone. There is a special reason, which is
  no business of yours, why I wish to reward these brethren of the Order for
  their services. There has been a great deal of unrest amongst the brethren,
  complaints that certain lodges have been favoured at the expense of others. I
  am merely distributing the argosies over a wider area."</p>

  <p>"You do not need a gun for that purpose. Anyway, Prior, I would not have
  done this thing. You employed me as an auditor for my honesty, and I will not
  be a party to any crooked practice that you suggest. Bring me the discs and
  the books, and I will sign the cheques."</p>

  <p>Again the purple man went out and came back with ten discs, which he laid
  on the bench by the side of Pawter.</p>

  <p>"Here they are," he said. "I will bring you the books"</p>

  <p>"Save yourself the trouble," said Pawter coldly. "These are not the discs
  I drew. I have a pretty good head for figures, and I could not possibly have
  made a mistake. I presume that these discs correspond with the names of the
  people you wish me to draw the cheques for, and I flatly refuse."</p>

  <p>"We will try another method," said the purple man softly. "There is such a
  thing as pain. If you were a member of the Twenty-Third Degree, you would
  realise that pain, hunger and thirst are three of the most potent factors in
  determining human comfort. I will not put you on the rack, or introduce you
  to The Maiden, Mr. Pawter. A pair of mundane curling tongs such as a wench
  may use to fringe her hair, heated by a spirit lamp, are quite as painful as
  any hot iron that might be drawn from a brazier and applied to your eyes!
  That makes you quiver, my friend! Believe me, I shall not hesitate to go to
  extreme lengths. Now what do you say?"</p>

  <p>"I refuse."</p>

  <p>"Very well." The voice came almost in a whisper. "You have brought this
  upon your own head!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37"></a>XXXVII. &mdash; A TRIP TO DEVON</h2>

  <p class="first">BETTY CAREW made a call on the residence of De Fell, the
  manager, and that young man was not too busy to see the girl to whom he had
  written on the previous night.</p>

  <p>"You've come to accept that part, have you? Well, you can start
  rehearsals"</p>

  <p>She shook her head with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I never dreamt I'd be in a position to do it, Mr. De Fell, but I've got
  to decline your engagement. I am going with my uncle to America."</p>

  <p>"The dickens you are!" said De Fell, swinging round and looking at the
  girl admiringly. "Does that mean you're out of the theatrical business for
  good?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I hope so in many ways, in others I should be very
  sorry."</p>

  <p>"Who is your uncle, by the way?" and, when she told him, he whistled.
  "Suffering cats! Why, I introduced him to you! Well, now, isn't that
  fine!"</p>

  <p>He had something to say about an old acquaintance of hers. "You weren't at
  La Florette's great jamboree last night? Well, you missed nothing except the
  exhibition of lavish expenditure, for no particular reason so far as I can
  discover, since Van Campe and I were the only theatrical people present. They
  say that she has been financed&mdash;by the way, what relation is Dr. Laffin
  to you&mdash;uncle?"</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"He is not my uncle," she said shortly.</p>

  <p>"Then you ought to be thankful. I can't understand that bird. Somebody
  told me that Laffin was behind this grand display of La Florette's, but I
  can't believe that. Is he a rich man?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He's very poor."</p>

  <p>She was loth to discuss the doctor at all, and took the earliest
  opportunity of bringing the interview to an end. There was another she would
  gladly have avoided, but Bullott had insisted upon seeing her that afternoon,
  and though he had made the environment for the appointment as pleasant as
  possible&mdash;he had chosen Mr. Stone's fiat&mdash;she went in some
  apprehension.</p>

  <p>Once again she told him of her dreams, of the chapel, the book upon her
  knees, the monk-like figures sitting beneath their banners, and the
  purple-robed man who had addressed her.</p>

  <p>"That is what I wanted to know," said Bullott at the finish. "You don't
  remember what happened to the book?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Would you know the place again if you saw it?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I should. Why&mdash;do you know where it is? Wasn't it a
  dream after all?"</p>

  <p>"You bet it wasn't!" said Bill Holbrook, an interested audience,
  energetically. "Miss Carew, the inspector wants you to go down with us
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"Where?" she said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Into Devonshire."</p>

  <p>"But I couldn't. Why into Devonshire?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, I think you'd better go," said Lambert Stone. "I have heard
  enough from these gentlemen to be convinced that there is some danger to your
  father."</p>

  <p>"My father!" she gasped. "Whom do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean the man in purple."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You're not jesting?"</p>

  <p>"No, that was your father. Mr. Bullott has made inquiries and has
  discovered that the Grand Priors of Ragusa have their headquarters on
  Dartmoor."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" Suddenly she remembered the adventure that had overtaken her and the
  doctor nearly two years before. "Now I remember. It was on Dartmoor that we
  saw those dreadful masked faces, and the voice&mdash;the voice of the man who
  stopped us&mdash;it was Brother John!"</p>

  <p>Incoherently she related the events of that wild night: the rain, the
  storm-swept moor, the red lantern in the road that had brought the car to a
  standstill, and the long absence of the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Yes," nodded Bullott, "you were near the Priory. Someone must have been
  taken ill there, and the doctor went to see him. It was after that that he
  got his idea for dressing you up in green and putting you in a shop
  window&mdash;I've got it!" His eyes were blazing with excitement.
  "Listen&mdash;this is what happened. It must have been Leiff Stone who was
  taken ill, and when the doctor saw him he must have gained his confidence.
  Your brother is something of a mystic, isn't he, sir?"</p>

  <p>Lambert nodded.</p>

  <p>"Given to strange dreams?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he always had his visions," said the other quietly. "Old man Laffin
  must have heard from him about some dream in which he saw a Messenger from
  the Absolute&mdash;that is the word&mdash;in the form of a red-haired girl in
  a green dress. Perhaps Leiff Stone's dream was that he would meet this girl
  sitting in a shop window, with a green jade vase and a red rose&mdash;can't
  you imagine what fantastic things he may have dreamt in his delirium? And
  Laffin thought it over, saw the immense opportunity which this knowledge gave
  to him, and gradually worked up to the grand climax! Do you remember the
  advertisement, Holbrook, the advertisement I showed you&mdash;'Punging the
  Green Dragon?' That was Laffin's signal to some confederate, probably in the
  Priory; somebody who informed him of all Mr. Leiff Stone's movements&mdash;he
  may have got at one of the laymen. At any rate, he induced the Prior to come
  to London, and pass the store where Miss Carew was working. When Stone had
  called that part of your work was finished. Laffin had evidently a role
  assigned to you, something referred to in the message which you had given to
  your father. He intended taking you to the Priory and detaining you in the
  house for the purpose, and then, when he failed, carried you off from your
  lodging. Try hard to remember, Miss Carew," he said earnestly, "what did
  Brother John say to you when he called at the theatre?"</p>

  <p>"He asked me if I was the lady who had been in the shop window," she said,
  "whether I was related to Dr. Laffin."</p>

  <p>"Then Brother John knew, or guessed, and he had come to London to protect
  his friend. And because he was seen speaking to you, they killed
  him&mdash;Laffin or his agent."</p>

  <p>He took a sheet of blue paper from his pocket, read it with some
  satisfaction and put it back.</p>

  <p>"I'm taking Laffin to-night," he said.</p>

  <p>"On a charge of killing Brother John?" asked Bill in surprise, for this
  was the first news he had had that a warrant had been issued for the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I am taking him on a charge of wilfully murdering the late Lord
  Lowbridge by the administration of poison. We've had the body up, and found
  enough aconite to kill a regiment of soldiers!</p>

  <p>"Don't you see," he said, when they had recovered a little from their
  surprise, "Laffin was the family doctor of the late Lord Lowbridge. Clive
  Lowbridge had been his pupil, and you might suppose that, with the property
  in the hands of his friend, it would be an easy matter to get the money he
  wanted and to hide the fact that, two years before Lord Lowbridge died,
  Laffin had got transferred, by means of a false deed, a considerable slice of
  Lord Lowbridge's property. The present holder of the title does not know
  this, but it is nevertheless a fact that the impoverished condition of his
  estate is due very considerably to the systematic forgeries of Laffin. The
  son of Lowbridge died in exactly the same manner&mdash;it may be the subject
  of another charge. Laffin is an expert poisoner, and the sooner we get him
  the better."</p>

  <p>"He is not at his house?" asked Bill in a hushed voice, for this
  revelation of his friend's prescience almost shocked him.</p>

  <p>Bullott shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I have been there. He left very early this morning. I think I know
  where he is to be found. Now, Miss Carew, will you come?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think I ought to go&mdash;for Clive's sake," she said, and Bill
  Holbrook was instantly and unaccountably depressed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch38"
     name="ch38"></a>XXXVIII. &mdash; A MAN AND A MAID</h2>

  <p class="first">The five o'clock west-bound mail carried a saloon in which
  were fifteen men and one woman, who did not usually undertake a journey to
  the West of England. Bullott was taking no chances. He had been allowed to
  select his own posse, and when, at eight o'clock that night, they reached
  Newton Abbot, he was confident that, whatever the search of the Priory might
  produce, he would not fail through lack of able assistance.</p>

  <p>Four big cars left at intervals for Two Bridges, partly because this made
  a convenient halting-place, and partly by reason of Bullott's knowledge that
  Pawter usually spent the night at the hotel when his duties brought him to
  the Priory.</p>

  <p>The first car carried Betty and her uncle, with Bill Holbrook, Inspector
  Bullott, and a detective at the driver's side.</p>

  <p>"I'm beginning to get thrilled," she said in a low voice, as the car came
  down to Buckfastleigh-in-the-Moor, and the severe splendour of the new Abbey
  showed for a second in the paling light. "And you are also, Mr.
  Holbrook&mdash;you've spoken hardly a word since we left town."</p>

  <p>"No." Bill roused himself with an effort. "I've got a thinking fit to-day.
  When are you leaving?"</p>

  <p>"On Saturday," she said. "I'm looking forward to that trip tremendously.
  The <i>Escorial</i> is the biggest ship in the new American line, isn't it,
  Mr. Stone?"</p>

  <p>"The biggest and the best," he said stoutly. "We're going to show these
  Europeans that we can run ships as well as the best organisations in England
  or Germany. The <i>Escorial</i> is the biggest ship in the world. Why, if
  you've never been on a mammoth liner, it is going to be an experience for
  you, Betty."</p>

  <p>He spoke of the great social halls, of the swimming-pool, the wonderful
  suites, the Florentine restaurant and the palm court, and Bill grew more
  dismal in inverse ratio to his companion's enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you come along? I'm making up a party for my camp in the
  Adirondacks?"</p>

  <p>Bill sighed heavily.</p>

  <p>"Get thee behind me, Lambert Stone," he groaned. "Such relaxations are for
  the idle rich. Battersea Park for mine, with the little boys fishing for
  sticklebacks, and the nursemaids and the howling children&mdash;oh gosh! you
  make me feel homesick!"</p>

  <p>"Why don't you come, Mr. Holbrook?" asked Betty, to her uncle's surprise.
  "You were one of the first people Mr. Stone suggested, but I&mdash;I thought
  you wouldn't like to join us."</p>

  <p>"Who's going?" asked Bill, and the first name damped any enthusiasm that
  was developing. "You'll enjoy it, anyway," he said. "We're getting near Two
  Bridges," with this he abruptly turned the subject.</p>

  <p>The car pulled up before the hotel and Bullott went to see Pawter. He came
  out very shortly afterwards, and in his voice was a note of concern.</p>

  <p>"Pawter hasn't returned," he said. "They say he is usually back by
  half-past nine, and it's past ten now."</p>

  <p>"He isn't that much behind his time that you need worry," said Stone.
  "What do you intend doing&mdash;I mean, what is the object of raiding the
  Priory?"</p>

  <p>"Primarily to take a good look at the gentlemen who are in control," said
  Bullott. "I wish to satisfy myself that Mr. Leiff Stone is what he appears to
  be&mdash;the head of a perfectly harmless organisation."</p>

  <p>Lambert Stone was looking at him intently.</p>

  <p>"That isn't your object, Mr. Bullott," he said quietly, "there is some
  other reason. My brother would not be a party to any illegal practices. Do
  you think that the Order has got into the hands of lawless men and that he is
  there too?"</p>

  <p>Bullott did not answer immediately, and then:</p>

  <p>"I think a good many things. I am scared about more," he said.</p>

  <p>The half-hour that followed afforded two members of the party an
  opportunity which one at least desired. Bill had strolled a little way along
  the dark road when he heard footsteps behind him, and, turning, discerned the
  figure of the girl.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Holbrook," she called, "I want to speak to you. Have I offended
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Offended me?" said Bill in amazement. "Why, no, Miss Carew."</p>

  <p>"Or is it your natural repugnance to compromise?"</p>

  <p>He did not see her smile, but he heard the laughter in her voice.</p>

  <p>"You aren't very friendly, are you? I remember not so long ago, when I
  walked a long way to avoid you. I am more shameless now. Are you very angry
  with me?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I be?"</p>

  <p>"Why won't you come to America? My uncle would have really liked to ask
  you; it was I who stopped him writing you an invitation. You see, Mr.
  Holbrook," she said as she walked by his side, "I was rather scared of you; I
  couldn't understand what part you were playing in that horrible scheme to put
  me in a shop window, and I told Clive&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shall we leave Lord Lowbridge out of account?" he said, with inexplicable
  exasperation.</p>

  <p>She was silent for a while.</p>

  <p>"You don't like Lord Lowbridge?"</p>

  <p>"I like him all right," said Bill. "I'm sorry I was so irritable."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you like him?" she insisted.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Does anybody like the perfect man&mdash;any other man, I
  mean?"</p>

  <p>He heard her soft laughter and grinned a little sheepishly.</p>

  <p>"You're jealous!"</p>

  <p>The astounding charge took his breath away.</p>

  <p>"Jealous?" he stammered. "What do you mean? How can I be jealous?"</p>

  <p>"You're jealous," she said again, "that is, if you're human."</p>

  <p>He had no words to answer her.</p>

  <p>"I've been on the stage&mdash;lived in an atmosphere where love and
  infatuation and the other pleasant mysteries of life are discussed so
  naturally and so persistently that even I can discuss them
  without&mdash;without embarrassment. A woman loses a great deal when she
  becomes sophisticated, but she gains in knowledge. Mr. Holbrook, you're
  falling in love, and you mustn't!"</p>

  <p>Never before in his life had he felt at such a disadvantage, so incapable
  of pert rejoinder. She was telling him something that consciously he had not
  known.</p>

  <p>"Why mustn't I?" he said. His voice was husky as he went on quickly, "Of
  course, I know you're frantically rich, and you're in love with another man,
  but they're the merest items, and anyway, there's nothing to prevent my
  loving you&mdash;if I want."</p>

  <p>"Except that I'm married," she said.</p>

  <p>He stopped dead.</p>

  <p>"To Lowbridge?" he asked, scarcely recognising his own voice.</p>

  <p>"No, to Dr. Laffin. I think you ought to know this. I am married in the
  sense that I have been through a ceremony before the registrar. I don't know
  why he did it, but&mdash;yes, I do."</p>

  <p>"Does Mr. Stone know?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said in a low voice, "I do not wish him to know&mdash;yet."</p>

  <p>They were nearing the hotel again when he halted. "Suppose you weren't
  married?" he asked, and it required all his courage to put the question.
  "Would that make a whole lot of difference to&mdash;to me, or to
  Lowbridge"</p>

  <p>"Let us go in," she said, turning. "I thought I heard the inspector
  call."</p>

  <p>But he would not move.</p>

  <p>"To whom would this make most difference?"</p>

  <p>"To both of you, I think," she said lightly, and then her arm was in his.
  "I shall never marry Clive," she said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch39"
     name="ch39"></a>XXXIX. &mdash; THE TEST</h2>

  <p class="first">PAWTER looked at the phosphorescent dial of his watch and
  with some difficulty returned it to his pocket, for the handcuffs about his
  wrists were of a type that he had never seen before. He suspected that they
  had been found in the monastery, and remembered the Grand Prior telling him,
  many years before, that he had discovered a cell evidently used to
  incarcerate monks who had lost their reason. He was probably in that prison
  house now.</p>

  <p>What would they do with him? Would the purple-veiled Prior carry his
  threat into execution? It was more than an hour since the man had taken his
  departure, and there had been no sign or sound of him.</p>

  <p>There were two doors in the small stone room in which he was held
  prisoner, and in spite of his bound ankles he had succeeded in hopping to
  both, to find, as he had expected, that they were locked. He had scarcely put
  away his watch before he heard the shooting of bolts, the door opened and the
  purple man came in, carrying a candle lantern, which he placed on the floor.
  By its side he put a flat metal case, which he opened, and Pawter saw, with
  some astonishment, that his captor literally intended to fulfil his threat,
  for he took out a diminutive spirit stove and a pair of steel tongs.</p>

  <p>He struck a match, and the stove burnt bluely. Then laying the tongs on
  two projecting brackets, he watched the steady flame curl about the
  steel.</p>

  <p>"It will take a little time before they are hot enough," said the muffled
  voice, "time for you to reflect, my friend." He went out of the room and
  returned with the coat which Pawter had taken off when he had put on his
  robe.</p>

  <p>"Our good friend Blackwood was curious as to where you had gone." He
  mentioned the fact casually.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" There was no tremor in Pawter's voice when he
  put the question. And then:</p>

  <p>"Hurt you," was the calm reply, "hurt you so badly that you will do as I
  wish."</p>

  <p>"In other words, you're going to revert to the practice of the Middle
  Ages, eh?" Pawter was calm, almost bland. "It has been a wonder to me how
  these ancient folk endured torture, and now I'm going to discover for
  myself!"</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what will happen," said the mask. "You have lived a
  fairly comfortable life, Mr. Pawter, maintained yourself free from aches and
  pains, and I doubt very much whether you can imagine what will happen when
  real pain, exquisite and terrible, comes to you."</p>

  <p>"I can imagine a whole lot of things," said Pawter, watching the blue
  flame of the spirit lamp, "but I can't imagine making myself a party to your
  fraud by signing those cheques."</p>

  <p>The Prior lifted the tongs, held them near to his face, and put them back
  again in the flames.</p>

  <p>"Not hot enough yet," he said pleasantly. "Pawter, you're a fool. I am
  willing to pay you a very considerable sum for your services, and to continue
  that payment every half-year. You would be a rich man in five years'
  time."</p>

  <p>"I'm a rich man now," said the other easily, "and if I did what you ask
  me, my riches would weight me down and crush me."</p>

  <p>At the end of five minutes, during which time neither man spoke, the Prior
  lifted the tongs.</p>

  <p>"They are hot," he said, and brought them near to Pawter's face, but the
  bald man did not shrink.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer, until the heat was intolerable, and yet, with an
  unbelievable stoicism, he sat rigid, unmoving.</p>

  <p>"Not pleasant, eh? Imagine them held to your eyelids&mdash;that makes you
  feel bad? Listen." The spurious amiability left his voice. "There's nothing I
  will not do to make you carry out my wishes. I'll blind you&mdash;do you
  understand that? I'll shut off from you the chief joy of life&mdash;your
  vision! Am I to be checked at the moment of my success by a dog of a
  tradesman?"</p>

  <p>His voice rose shrilly, the hands that held the tongs were trembling.</p>

  <p>"At the very edge of fortune, shall I hesitate&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>Rap, rap, rap.</i></p>

  <p>Somebody was knocking at the door. He half turned.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" he called.</p>

  <p><i>Rap, rap, rap.</i></p>

  <p>"Who is it?" The man in purple almost screamed the question.</p>

  <p>"Open, in the name of the King!" said a voice on the other side of the
  door&mdash;the voice of Inspector Bullott!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch40"
     name="ch40"></a>XL. &mdash; THE WOMAN WITH THE JUG</h2>

  <p class="first">THE door shook under a heavy blow, and the Prior stood
  momentarily paralysed with terror and consternation.</p>

  <p>"Open!"</p>

  <p>Pawter too had recognised the voice of Inspector Bullott, and he drew a
  long sigh. In another second the Prior had lifted the lantern and blown out
  the light; there was the rattle of a key in a door, and a sound of creaking
  hinges; then followed a thud, as the door closed.</p>

  <p>He was escaping through the smaller door, and he had hardly left the room
  before Pawter heard the sound of voices outside, the snap of a lock, and in
  another instant Bullott had dashed into the room, an electric torch in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Pawter nodded towards the small postern.</p>

  <p>"Is there a key to this?" cried Bullott sharply.</p>

  <p>Blackwood came into the cell, bearing a bunch of keys, his red face
  unusually pale. Five minutes were lost before the key was discovered. Bullott
  then found himself in a smaller stone lobby. From this led a door, which when
  it was opened, he discovered to be the postern gate through which the Grand
  Prior was admitted to the building. There was no sign of the man, nor was a
  search possible, for it opened on to the wild moor, now in complete darkness,
  and it would have required a battalion to have continued the search.</p>

  <p>The inspector returned to the Priory and conducted a close examination of
  the priors. He came to the room into which Pawter had been ushered, with a
  story of failure.</p>

  <p>"The Grand Prior and Brother James have gone," he said, "and whoever the
  Prior may be, he is not Leiff Stone!" Seeing that a search that night would
  be wasted labour, Bullott returned to the room which had been allotted to
  Pawter. Here he interrupted the publicity man in the midst of his recital. A
  further and more systematic search of the Priory led to no discovery of
  value, and at one o'clock in the morning the search party was withdrawn, to
  the relief of the ruffled Priors.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what action the Secretary of State will take now that this
  matter of the draw has been brought to his notice," said Bullott, "but I
  suggest, Mr. Pawter, that until you learn the wishes of the members of your
  Order, you had better take up the duties of the Chief Prior."</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Pawter offered no objection to adopting this course, for
  apparently he had already decided what action he would take.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose for one moment that our friend will return," he said,
  "but if he does, I can promise you that I will place him immediately in your
  hands. As to taking control of the Order, that has already been provided for.
  I have a deed signed by Mr. Stone, authorising me to take charge if anything
  happened to him."</p>

  <p>"Did you recognise his voice?"</p>

  <p>Pawter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, though I'll swear it was not Mr. Stone." Blackwood, the seneschal,
  was closely questioned, and added something to the detective's knowledge. He
  remembered the night that Betty had been brought to the Priory, though he
  swore that she had not come through the main gates. The other Priors were
  unanimous that she had come there of her own free will, a pardonable error,
  for she had, apparently, walked to her chair unassisted; they had not been
  informed as to the meaning of the strange scene they had witnessed. All they
  knew was that the Grand Prior had addressed them an hour before the girl was
  brought in, and had told them that he was receiving a "divine visitor." Nor
  did they know who were the two brethren who had stood on either side of her
  when the book was placed upon her knees. As to the book, that was as much of
  a mystery to them as it had been to the girl.</p>

  <p>The Grand Prior was in the building the next morning. He seldom journeyed
  by day, left as a rule just before midnight, and drove his own car, which was
  kept in a small garage that had been built on the north side of the Priory
  wall.</p>

  <p>Bullott went to inspect this building, and found, as he had expected, that
  it was empty. Further, the seneschal could not assist them, for he seldom saw
  the Prior himself except on extraordinary occasions, and he did not know how
  many days the head of the Order had been at the Priory before the startling
  events of that night.</p>

  <p>The party drove back the way they had come, and nearing two Bridges,
  Pawter, who accompanied them, remembered the old waiter who had a cottage on
  the moor.</p>

  <p>"That must be the place," he said, pointing to the little dwelling,
  visible in the light of the motor lamps.</p>

  <p>As the car stopped before the door, it opened and Pawter saw the servant.
  He was a little tremulous at sight of so many people at such an hour of the
  night, but he had a tale to tell of a machine that had dashed past an hour
  before.</p>

  <p>"A big black car with three men, and going at such a rate that I thought
  they'd turn over at the curve. I think they must have had an accident,
  because I heard the brakes go on, and a bump."</p>

  <p>Beyond the cottage the road turned abruptly, and here there was a wall
  which showed marks of collision.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't serious enough to stop them," said Bullott after making his
  inspection. "Those were our men undoubtedly."</p>

  <p>A police patrol whom they met near Two Bridges had the same story to tell
  of a car that was thundering along the road in defiance of all speed
  regulations.</p>

  <p>"I signalled them to stop, but they took no more notice of me than if I'd
  been a fly on the wall," he said.</p>

  <p>"Any number on the car?" asked Bullott hopefully.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, they had no back light so far as I could see. They took the
  Exeter road."</p>

  <p>"I'll get on the 'phone to the Exeter police," said Bullott, after they
  had gained admission to the hotel, but in this project he was not successful.
  The wires which followed the Exeter road had been cut, and there was no other
  telephonic communication.</p>

  <p>In point of fact the big black car did not take the risk of being observed
  in a fairly populous city where it must go at a slow pace. Five miles from
  the suburbs of Exeter, Joshua Laffin leant across to the driver and bawled in
  his ear:</p>

  <p>"Keep away from Exeter. There's a by-road to the left that takes you past
  Taunton."</p>

  <p>Captain Harvey Hale waved his hand, not taking his eyes from the road
  ahead.</p>

  <p>At eight o'clock that morning Dr. Laffin arrived at Bath Station, caught
  the early train, and was in his home before eleven o'clock. Detectives
  watching the house saw him come, and duly reported his arrival to Bullott,
  but long before the inspector was on the spot, Mr. William Holbrook was
  knocking at the front door, which was opened by Laffin's servant.</p>

  <p>"The master is busy," she said, remembering the trouble which had been
  caused to her through admitting him on his last visit.</p>

  <p>"I'm busy too," said Bill, and pushed past her into the hall.</p>

  <p>Without a word he turned the handle of the study door, threw it open and
  walked inside. The room was, as usual, heavily curtained, and the only light
  was a candle upon the table. Joshua Laffin was nowhere to be seen.</p>

  <p>"I thought he was there, sir," said the girl, aghast. "He must be in his
  room. I'll run up."</p>

  <p>She came down in a few minutes with the news that the doctor was not in
  the house.</p>

  <p>As he stood there, the area door below opened and an elderly woman in an
  old mantle, and carrying a big milk jug and a key in her hand, came out,
  shuffled down the path and turned towards the station. It was apparently
  Laffin's cook. He saw the two detectives watching on the opposite side of the
  road, and knew there was no chance of the man escaping. Turning to the girl,
  who was standing aimlessly in the passage, he asked:</p>

  <p>"What time did the doctor come back?"</p>

  <p>"About ten o'clock, sir. I told him the police were coming
  here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You told him that, did you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, sir, they quite frightened me. There have been two men watching
  this house all the morning and all last night. I got so nervous that I nearly
  went home to my mother."</p>

  <p>"But why do that?" said Bill good-humouredly. "Surely the cook is some
  sort of protection, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"Cook, sir?" said the girl in surprise. "We haven't got a cook. I do all
  the cooking there is."</p>

  <p>"But who's the elderly woman in the kitchen downstairs?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"There isn't any elderly woman, sir. We have a charwoman in once a week,
  but this is not her day."</p>

  <p>A sudden suspicion shot through Holbrook's mind, and he ran out of the
  front door, down into the street, and gazed the way the old woman had gone.
  It was at that moment that Bullott arrived, and the reporter told him what he
  had seen.</p>

  <p>"That was Laffin all right," said Bullott bitterly. "He walked into the
  trap, and we hadn't sufficient intelligence to close it on him."</p>

  <p>He called the two watchers and gave them instructions. In ten minutes all
  West London was looking for an elderly woman carrying a milk jug and a
  key.</p>

  <p>Lord Lowbridge heard the news with a grave face.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" he said when they told him that Laffin was wanted for murder
  by poisoning. "My uncle died a natural death."</p>

  <p>"Who gave the certificate?" asked Bullott significantly, and Clive
  Lowbridge stared.</p>

  <p>"I never thought of that. Of course, Dr. Laffin gave the certificate. But
  it is too preposterous&mdash;what could he hope to gain?"</p>

  <p>"He could hope to make you a very rich man and trust that your generosity
  would reward him. He hoped also to hide the fact, which would have been
  discovered by Lord Lowbridge, and certainly should have been discovered by
  his lawyers, that a large parcel of land had been transferred to Laffin by
  means of forged deeds. In other words, my lord, Dr. Laffin is partly
  responsible for the poverty of your estate!" Clive's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"It is incredible," he muttered. And then, aloud, "I have never cared very
  much for Laffin, although I thought I owed him something, and probably your
  view as to what would have happened if I had inherited a large fortune is
  nearly accurate. As a matter of fact, I had decided in my mind to give the
  doctor a very substantial sum. He was always in debt, and generally in the
  worst kind of other trouble; it would have been a real pleasure to me to have
  relieved that state of affairs for him. And my cousin, too, you say?" He
  whistled. "It sounds like a page of an exciting novel, but I must believe
  you. Laffin is not like other men; his virtues and vices are equally
  bizarre."</p>

  <p>"Did he ever introduce you to the Proud Sons of Ragusa?"</p>

  <p>Clive Lowbridge laughed.</p>

  <p>"No, he never succeeded in shooting me into that crowd," he said, "but it
  was not for want of trying. But that sort of mummery does not appeal to me,
  and my luck is so diabolical that I could never hope to have gained one of
  their big prizes. They give some prizes, don't they? In fact"&mdash;there was
  a note of unhappiness in his laughter&mdash;"the biggest prize in all the
  world, which most men would have thought was easiest to gain, has so far
  escaped me&mdash;and it isn't money."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch41"
     name="ch41"></a>XLI. &mdash; FLORETTE COMPLAINS</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL was in his room shaving late in the morning, when
  Bullott rushed in.</p>

  <p>"I've got a bit of news that will interest you, Holbrook," he said. "There
  were three people in that car that left Exeter; I've been able to trace them.
  The driver was a tall man, who will be difficult to identify because his face
  was covered with goggles, but he is, I believe, Captain Harvey Hale, a man
  who has been in prison, and a pretty bad character. The second man was, of
  course, Joshua Laffin."</p>

  <p>"And the third?" asked Bill.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you three guesses."</p>

  <p>"Not Toby Marsh?" said Holbrook.</p>

  <p>"Toby Marsh and no other," said Bullott. "I've been to his lodgings to
  make absolutely sure, but he hasn't been there since last night. He was
  riding with Laffin, and the two were seen talking very confidentially by a
  policeman as they came into Bath, where the car was garaged at the Hudson
  Hotel. This confirms the story of the Taunton police and the waiter at Two
  Bridges, who say there were two men beside the driver."</p>

  <p>"Toby Marsh!" Holbrook was bewildered.</p>

  <p>"If I have failed it is my own fault," said Bullott despondently. "Those
  gay writers in the newspapers said I was a fool to take this little thief
  into my confidence&mdash;and they are more than justified. Now that it is too
  late, I have discovered that Laffin and Marsh were old acquaintances. The
  only conviction that the police have against Marsh is for breaking and
  entering Laffin's place in Bath. I've been looking at the records of the
  case, and the story is a simple one. Laffin was, as usual, in a state of
  poverty, but had some valuable books and old Egyptian manuscripts, which he
  had insured heavily. The story Marsh told was that he was an acquaintance of
  Laffin's, and had been employed by him to commit the burglary with the object
  of getting the insurance, though the Egyptian papyri were subsequently proved
  to be practically valueless. Naturally, nobody believed the burglar against a
  respected local doctor, and Toby was sent down, swearing he would get even
  with the man who double-crossed him."</p>

  <p>"But why should Marsh have given us all this information about
  Laffin?"</p>

  <p>"Partly for revenge," said Bullott, "partly, and in the latter stages of
  the case, to pull the wool over our eyes, or, to put it vulgarly, to kid us
  along. No, we've been sold. There's no sense in squealing. Are you going with
  the Stones to America?" he asked, changing the subject abruptly.</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," he said, without heartiness. "In fact, I know I
  shan't. You seem to forget that I'm on this story of Laffin"</p>

  <p>"I should go if I were you "&mdash;Bullott interrupted him&mdash;"because
  I am!"</p>

  <p>"You?"</p>

  <p>The detective nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've seen the Chief this morning, and he has decided that I ought to
  join the party. Do you know what relation Betty Carew is to the doctor?"</p>

  <p>Bill was silent.</p>

  <p>"That young lady is going to be the candle to the moth. She is the one
  assistant Laffin can depend upon, unwilling though she may be; for by the law
  she cannot give evidence against her husband. He married her to silence her;
  there is an excellent reason&mdash;two excellent reasons, in fact&mdash;why
  he should follow her to America."</p>

  <p>"They may be excellent," said Bill, "but they don't appear that way to me.
  Besides, I've got another anchor in London. Pips has taken on the
  reconstruction of the Proud Sons of Ragusa. Maybe there'll be no Proud Sons
  to reconstruct after the Secretary of State has taken action. If it isn't
  reconstructed it will be wound up, and Pips will be busy. I cannot let his
  business go to ruin."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, you will be well advised to come along with me," said
  Bullott.</p>

  <p>"Where is Leiff Stone?" asked Bill.</p>

  <p>"God knows," was the grave reply. "I haven't dared to tell Miss Stone all
  that I suspect."</p>

  <p>Bill Holbrook did not see him for the rest of the day; he himself was
  fully occupied with putting into writing the story of the raid on the Priory,
  and in consultation with Pawter. That worthy man had lost no time in seeing
  the high officers of state, and had exposed to them all that he knew of the
  workings of the Order.</p>

  <p>"They have no objection to our carrying on, but they insist that the
  Priors shall not be masked, and that the annual distribution of argosies must
  be determined by merit and not by chance."</p>

  <p>"That sounds as though most of the money will come to me," said Bill.</p>

  <p>For some reason the depression which had laid on his mind like a cloud
  during the past few weeks had vanished, and he could trace his sense of
  relief and cheerfulness to that little talk he had had with the girl on the
  Dartmoor road. It was not a thing to think about, even to dream about, but he
  was filled with a sense of awed amazement that she had condescended to speak
  to him on such tremendous matters. It was that sense of wonder and humility
  that comes to every man at some time in his life, when a goddess has stepped
  down to him from her pedestal and has been as a human woman.</p>

  <p>Toward the evening, when he was working at the newspaper office, the City
  Editor brought him news that the body of Tinker Lane had been found, and
  later came a prosaic reminder of his own responsibility in the matter, in the
  shape of a policeman bearing an order to appear before the coroner's
  inquest.</p>

  <p>Every tape message that reached the office concerning Laffin was brought
  to him, for now the news that the man was wanted for murder was common
  property. A reward had been offered for his arrest; every station and port
  was being watched; but Laffin had disappeared, and though a taxicab driver
  had been found who had picked up the old woman with the milk jug and the key
  and had set her down near a City hospital, he was not able to contribute any
  helpful clue.</p>

  <p>It was eleven o'clock at night, and he had handed in his last copy and
  risen stiffly from his desk, when the bell of the inter-telephone rang and
  the hall porter told him that there was a lady to see him. His heart
  jumped.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Miss Florette, sir."</p>

  <p>Florette! He had forgotten that unfortunate woman, saddled, as he guessed,
  with the responsibilities of a large West End house.</p>

  <p>"Show her up."</p>

  <p>To say that La Florette was in a state of agitation is mildly to describe
  the half-hysterical, half-furious woman who was shown into his little office.
  Florette spent a considerable time every day in hiding the traces by which
  ruthless nature scores the passage of the years, but to-night she had made no
  attempt to doll up, Bill noticed. Her face was haggard, and the dark lines
  about her eyes revealed the state of mind into which Laffin's perfidy had
  thrown her.</p>

  <p>"Has that devil been found?" she asked immediately she came into the room.
  "Oh, Mr. Holbrook, isn't it dreadful! All I've had from him was five hundred,
  though he promised faithfully he'd send me a cheque the next morning! I
  haven't seen the colour of his money, and the tradesmen's bills are coming
  in; it will cost me over two thousand to settle! And it was Van Campe's
  fault; he said I'd get publicity out of it, and I haven't got so much as a
  line! Whatever am I to do?"</p>

  <p>"If you'll sit down quietly and tell me all about it," said Bill, "maybe I
  can help you&mdash;as far as publicity goes."</p>

  <p>"Not that kind of publicity," she said shrilly. "I don't want anybody to
  know that it wasn't my house, or that somebody else was paying the bills! It
  would ruin me professionally, Mr. Holbrook. I've got to think of my career.
  And Charles says that he won't pay a penny. I'm ruined, absolutely
  ruined!"</p>

  <p>Bill looked at the ten thousand dollar wristlet she wore, was dazzled by
  the scintillations of a great, pear-shaped diamond that hung on her breast,
  and even observed that the hands that gesticulated in despair sent forth
  strange and beautiful, flashes of colour, and in the face of this evidence of
  "ruin" was not as sympathetic as he might have been.</p>

  <p>"It's not my house at all," she said; "of course you knew that? Laffin
  took it because he wanted to find out something about Sir Richard Paxton, who
  is one of the heads of the Treasury. I don't understand very much about it,
  because Stock Exchange business makes my head ache. But it was all about the
  war that he wanted to know. It seems that we owe America a lot of money."</p>

  <p>"Have you only just discovered that?" asked Bill with gentle irony.</p>

  <p>"How was I to know?" she asked impatiently. "Anyway, we <i>do</i> owe
  America a lot of money, and we have to pay them every year or half-
  year&mdash;I forget which. And he wanted me to find out when the next
  interest&mdash;that was the word, 'interest'&mdash;was to be paid. He said
  that the British Government had been buying dollars, and he wanted to make
  sure whether the money was going to America in paper currency or in gold, and
  I had an awful job to find out, Mr. Holbrook. You've no idea how mean these
  Government people are. And Sir Richard likes me very much indeed&mdash;in
  fact, he's perfectly dippy about me." She could not resist the simper and the
  downcast eyes that accompanies this immodest claim.</p>

  <p>Bill was listening with all ears now. The mystery of the house in Portman
  Place was less of a mystery to him.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it was because I had this grand house that he was more open and
  frank with me. It's curious what snobs people are&mdash;but they are, Mr.
  Holbrook! Anyway, he told me that the money was being sent in paper
  currency&mdash;that's the term, isn't it? paper currency?"</p>

  <p>"That's the term," said Bill, with an assumption of carelessness. "And
  when is it to be shipped?"</p>

  <p>"On the twenty-ninth of July&mdash;that's next week&mdash;by the&mdash;"
  she frowned in an effort of memory. "I can never keep ships in my
  head&mdash;it was a curious name"</p>

  <p><i>"Escorial?"</i> asked Bill, his heart beating a little faster. "That's
  it&mdash;the <i>Escorial</i>. Fifty million dollars! Isn't it wicked to send
  all that money to America? They'll probably spend it on cinemas, which are
  ruining our profession. Fifty million dollars!" She literally groaned. "And
  I've got twenty tradesmen waiting on my doorstep, and heaven knows where the
  money's coming from! I've never been so deceived in my life, Mr. Holbrook. He
  ought to get twenty years for what he did for me. Is there any chance of
  finding him?" she asked, with pathetic anxiety.</p>

  <p>"The police are trying very hard to find him."</p>

  <p>"Has he any money? I mean, would it be possible, if he is captured, for
  him to give me a cheque?" she whimpered. "I'm sure the police would think all
  the better of him if he paid his obligations. I don't know which way to turn,
  and mother's so upset because her paying guest has gone away, and the police
  have been to the house looking for him. Really, Mr. Holbrook, I think I shall
  go mad unless something happens."</p>

  <p>"One moment," said Bill. "Did you tell Dr. Laffin all that Sir Richard
  Paxton told you&mdash;I mean, about the money going on the
  <i>Escorial</i>?</p>

  <p>She nodded vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Of course I did; I told him on Sunday night, just as soon as Sir Richard
  told me. There wasn't anything wrong in that, was there?" she asked in sudden
  alarm.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what view the police will take of it," said Bill gravely,
  and La Florette went white.</p>

  <p>"Has he been doing something very wrong?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think he could do anything much worse than murder, and you know
  they want him for that," said Bill, a little irritably.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know, but has he been stealing money?" asked Florette, to whom the
  first letter of sin was "$."</p>

  <p>He got rid of her as soon as he possibly could, promising to give her the
  first news of Laffin's capture, and to inform her at the earliest possible
  date as to the doctor's financial position. He himself left the office a few
  minutes after La Florette, and, since his mind needed the sedative of
  exercise, he decided to walk home.</p>

  <p>He strolled leisurely up Fleet Street, along the Strand, still bright and
  populated, for the great hotels had not yet discharged their supper parties;
  crossed Trafalgar Square, and, acting upon the whim of the moment, turned
  under the Admiralty Arch and walked along the Mall. At this hour of the
  night, even the courting couples had disappeared, and beyond the cars and
  cabs that take a short cut to Victoria, there was little to be seen.</p>

  <p>He saw no pedestrians until he overtook a man who was walking slowly
  towards Buckingham Palace. Something in his gait seemed familiar, and yet he
  would not have troubled to look into the face, but just as he was abreast of
  the solitary walker the man gave a short, dry cough, and Bill spun round. For
  a second only he was in doubt: the sallow face and the short-clipped, black
  beard were wholly unfamiliar to him. The horn-rimmed spectacles that
  surmounted the thin nose were equally strange. He hesitated, facing the man,
  whose eyes glared balefully in the semi-darkness.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" said the voice, and that was his mistake.</p>

  <p>In an instant Bill Holbrook had gripped him.</p>

  <p>"I want you, Dr. Laffin!" he said.</p>

  <p>His free hand tore away the beard that hid the cruel mouth. The doctor
  winced with the pain of it; then without a word, he struck out. His blow
  caught Holbrook unprepared, and he stumbled backwards, but before Laffin
  could run, Bill had reached out and caught his coat. For a second they
  struggled desperately, and then over the man's shoulder he saw a policeman
  approaching from the direction of St. James's.</p>

  <p>Laffin's strength was extraordinary, he fought like a cat, striking out
  wildly, and wherever his blow fell Bill grunted with the shock of it. And
  then, as the policeman came up, occurred a maddening accident which was to
  have such remarkable consequences.</p>

  <p>Laffin's fist had struck Bill full in the mouth. Savagely he hit back; the
  doctor dodged, and the blow, going across his shoulder, caught the policeman
  under the jaw and sent him sprawling. In a second he was on his feet, had
  torn the men apart, flinging the doctor against the railings of the Park and
  holding Bill in a grip from which there was no escape.</p>

  <p>"Take that man, quick! He's Laffin!" gasped the reporter.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you," said the officer savagely, and swung him round. "Come a
  little walk with me!"</p>

  <p>"Take him, take him!" yelled Bill, as he saw Laffin, turning on his heel,
  run like the wind. "He's wanted for murder!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch42"
     name="ch42"></a>XLII. &mdash; AN ADDITIONAL PASSENGER</h2>

  <p class="first">THE grip on collar and arm did not relax.</p>

  <p>"I'll teach you to hit me!" breathed the officer.</p>

  <p>"It was an accident, you fool!" stormed Bill, making the situation worse.
  "Take that man&mdash;he's Laffin, I tell you. They'll have the coat off your
  back if you let him escape!"</p>

  <p>"Never mind about Laffin; I've heard that fairy tale before," said the
  policeman, as he walked briskly, Bill's arm in his, past the sentry at St.
  James's Palace.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to do but to submit, and Bill Holbrook found himself
  thrust into a steel pen, answering the conventional questions of the station
  sergeant. When they had been put:</p>

  <p>"I want you to communicate with Inspector Bullott," said Bill, giving the
  address. "He's a personal friend of mine. I tell you, the man that this
  officer allowed to escape was Joshua Laffin, who is wanted on a charge of
  murder."</p>

  <p>The sergeant looked across his spectacles.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" he said, with polite sarcasm. "And is there anybody else
  you'd like to communicate with? The King or anybody?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mind telephoning my newspaper?" said Bill, who knew that it would
  be a waste of time trying to match his wits with the officer. "Perhaps you'll
  not be so comic to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>A claim of association with a newspaper was more effective than his
  statement that he was a friend of Bullott.</p>

  <p>But, by extraordinary bad luck, there was no member of the night staff who
  knew him. The City Editor had gone home, and the men on duty were strangers
  to him; and when he had at last persuaded the sergeant to communicate with
  Bullott, it was to discover that that officer also was not at home.</p>

  <p>He spent the night in a police cell, and at ten o'clock the next morning
  was brought before the magistrate, charged with disorderly conduct and
  striking Police Constable Higgins in the execution of his duty. It was so
  ludicrous so amazingly grotesque an experience, that he did not know whether
  to laugh or cry when the magistrate inflicted a small fine, and he almost ran
  out of the court.</p>

  <p>A taxi took him to his lodgings, and he found the inspector's housekeeper
  scrubbing the front passage.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bullott, sir? Didn't you know that he was leaving?"</p>

  <p>"Leaving&mdash;for where?"</p>

  <p>"For America, sir, he went this morning."</p>

  <p>"Is it Saturday?" said Bill in horror.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is, sir." She looked at him suspiciously; she had never
  before seen this untidy young man under the influence of drink. "Mr. Bullott
  was very worried about your not coming home last night; he wanted to see you
  and left a note in your room."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, I was locked up," said Bill recklessly, and dashed up
  the stairs to find the letter.</p>

  <p>It was a very short note, but significant.</p>

  <p>"If it is humanly possible for you to join the <i>Escorial</i>, do so.
  Something very queer is happening."</p>

  <p>That was all&mdash;it was a message without introduction, date or
  signature, scribbled hastily in pencil. Did Bullott know about the Treasury
  official's indiscretion? Did he realise that the <i>Escorial</i> was carrying
  fifty million dollars in paper currency to New York? Bill's head was in a
  whirl. He sat down and tried hard to think consecutively. The thought
  uppermost in his mind was that some extraordinary danger threatened Betty
  Carew. But the basis for this fear he could not define.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch; it was eleven o'clock. On Saturday there would be
  nobody in the office, but he knew where to find the editor, and in a few
  minutes was on the 'phone to him, telling him what he had learnt on the
  previous night. The editor made a quick decision.</p>

  <p>"I'll fix the police," he said. "Go along to the American Consul, explain
  the position to him, and get your passport visaed. I'll have reservations
  made for you on the ship by wireless. What time does the <i>Escorial</i>
  sail?"</p>

  <p>"At midday; it will leave in an hour," said Bill.</p>

  <p>There was a silence at the other end of the wire.</p>

  <p>"I'll hire a car to take you to Southampton," came the instructions, "and
  will wire the seaplane company to have a machine waiting to carry you to
  Cherbourg. Fly over to France and pick up the <i>Escorial</i>; she'll not
  leave Cherbourg before six o'clock to-night. Have you got any money?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Bill promptly.</p>

  <p>"Very good, I'll send my butler along with the car and the cash; he'll
  meet you outside the Consulate."</p>

  <p>Bill slammed down the receiver on to the machine, flew into his room and
  packed all the clothes that were visible, whilst the housekeeper went in
  search of a taxi.</p>

  <p>The Consulate was closing when he arrived. The Consul, indeed, had already
  taken his departure, and it seemed impossible that the all-important visa
  could be obtained. Nevertheless, visa or no visa, Bill Holbrook was
  determined that he would make the trip. The most they could do would be to
  turn him back from New York, and he thought he had influences sufficiently
  strong in that city to find his way into his native land without making
  acquaintance with Ellis Island. Happily, this unsatisfactory course was not
  necessary, for, after a telephone consultation with his chief, the Assistant
  Consul was able to stamp his passport, and by the time this business was
  through, and Bill had emerged on to Bedford Square, he found the editor's
  servant waiting with a roll of money. And at the sidewalk was the car that
  the editor had hired.</p>

  <p>At half-past three that afternoon he arrived at Southampton, to learn that
  the <i>Escorial</i> had sailed promptly at midday, and would arrive at
  Cherbourg at six o'clock that night. It took him a longer time than he
  supposed to find the headquarters of the seaplane company, and it was nearly
  five before, with a thunderous roar of her tractors, the little plane rose
  steeply from the water, and, mounting higher and higher, headed for
  Cherbourg. Midway the engine began to misfire, and the pilot was forced to
  bring her down on to the water, which fortunately was smooth. Another
  half-hour was wasted whilst he corrected the error which had led to the
  forced landing.</p>

  <p>Bill was in that agony of fear and anger which is only experienced by
  those who find themselves held up when they are late for an appointment. But
  at last the repairs were completed and the seaplane buzzed up again, and as
  his watch pointed to half-past seven they sighted the French coast and
  presently the huge bulk of the <i>Escorial</i>, with her four funnels and her
  tremendous hull.</p>

  <p>Even as the ship came into sight, he saw a white feather of steam shoot
  out from her siren, and knew that she was signalling her departure. Down
  swept the plane, coming to rest within a fathom of the high hull, just as the
  gangway was being pulled up from the tender.</p>

  <p>Bill signalled frantically, and, at the imminent risk of his life, walked
  the somewhat precarious foothold of the seaplane's float, and, barely
  managing to reach the bulwarks of the tender, swung himself aboard. The
  gangway was up, but he was evidently expected, for a pilot ladder was dropped
  immediately, and, clinging desperately to the rope, he reached one of the
  lower decks and was hauled on board.</p>

  <p>It was not until then that he realised that he had left his bag on the
  seaplane, but somehow this did not worry him greatly. Within a few yards of
  him was, as he knew, Betty Carew, and that was compensation for any material
  loss.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch43"
     name="ch43"></a>XLIII. &mdash; ON BOARD THE "ESCORIAL"</h2>

  <p class="first">"YOU cut it rather fine."</p>

  <p>Bill looked round and gripped the hand of Bullott.</p>

  <p>"The purser told me he'd had your wire, but we'd given you up. Our stay at
  Cherbourg was shorter than usual, and you were lucky to make it."</p>

  <p>They went down to the purser's office together, and Bill received the
  steamship ticket, which had been ordered by wireless, and was shown to a
  small cabin on one of the upper decks.</p>

  <p>In greater detail than was usual with him, he told the story of La
  Florette's visit and his subsequent misadventure.</p>

  <p>"You're sure it was Laffin?"</p>

  <p>"Certain," said Bill emphatically. "I knew him even with his beard on.
  Once that was off, he made no disguise of his identity. If that blundering
  idiot of a policeman hadn't pinched me, I'd have had him under lock and
  key."</p>

  <p>Bullott pulled at his cigar and looked thoughtfully at the new
  passenger.</p>

  <p>"I don't think they'll make any attempt to get the money&mdash;which is on
  board, by the way&mdash;until they get to New York. At any rate, the captain
  and the ship's officers know that there is some possibility of the strongroom
  being forced, and they've put a couple of armed guards before the purser's
  safe."</p>

  <p>"Is it in an inaccessible place?" asked Bill.</p>

  <p>"No, as a matter of fact, it is behind the purser's cabin, and the only
  possible way in which it can be forced is through that apartment. This, of
  course, is not the strong-room in which the money would be stored if it were
  in bullion: there's a bigger vault down below. But as the payment is made in
  paper, the purser's own deposit is considered to be the best possible place
  for it. Day and night there is somebody on duty; the purser himself sleeps in
  a berth which covers the door; and in addition, as I have said, they have put
  two armed quartermasters on duty."</p>

  <p>"There are no suspicious characters amongst the passengers?"</p>

  <p>"It is too early to say that," said Bullott. "With eleven hundred
  fashionable and semi-fashionable folk in the first and second class, it is
  quite possible that we shall find a few who wouldn't be qualified if we were
  choosing archbishops. There are, for instance, eight known cardsharpers
  working the line, and probably as many more who are unknown. But the purser
  and the ship's police are certain that these men are not in any way
  dangerous. They specialise in their own particular graft and have no time for
  sidelines. Do you know the ship? She's wonderful!"</p>

  <p>"A newspaper man knows everything," said Bill.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch44"
     name="ch44"></a>XLIV. &mdash; BETTY'S FEAR</h2>

  <p class="first">LATER, he was to find that Mr. Bullott's enthusiastic
  description was by no means far-fetched. The United States liner
  <i>Escorial</i> was by far the most luxurious vessel that ever rode the
  Atlantic. Never had the easy description of "floating palace" been so
  truthful in its application. From the gymnasium on the upper deck to the
  pillared swimming pool on H deck, she was the last word in magnificent
  accommodation. Ten elevators carried her passengers from deck to deck: her
  huge social hall, with its priceless tapestries and its elegant furnishings,
  was without a peer. Bill paced the long promenade deck, his eyes seeking for
  Betty Stone, and marvelled at the hugeness of this leviathan.</p>

  <p>The spacious deck was crowded with loungers, for the dinner bugle had not
  yet sounded. He searched the rows upon rows of deck chairs that stood in the
  deep recesses, without, however, catching so much as a glimpse of the girl,
  and when he joined Bullott in the beautiful smoke-room, he casually mentioned
  the failure of his search.</p>

  <p>"Miss Stone is unpacking: I just saw her maid. There's Lowbridge." He
  pointed to a padded corner of the room where Clive Lowbridge sat at his ease,
  a cigarette between his lips, his eyes on the carved ceiling. Their eyes met,
  and with a lift of his eyebrows and a smile Clive sprang up and came towards
  him.</p>

  <p>"This is an unexpected pleasure, Holbrook. When did you come on board? I
  didn't see you at Southampton. You weren't by any chance the crazy man who
  arrived by aeroplane at Cherbourg?"</p>

  <p>"I was that lunatic?" said Bill.</p>

  <p>"I was watching you disembark and wondering whether you would be drowned.
  Well, what is the news from London? It seems ten years since we left. Have
  you heard anything of Laffin?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him last night," said Bill grimly, "and in consequence spent the
  night in a cold, cold prison cell, with a soused pickpocket for a
  companion."</p>

  <p>Clive's face was grave, and when Bill had finished his short
  narrative:</p>

  <p>"I find it difficult to believe that Laffin is such a blackguard," he
  said. "In many ways I'm glad to be out of it all&mdash;it doesn't bear
  thinking about. It seems that the only person left with any faith in the
  doctor is Benson."</p>

  <p>"Benson? Oh, you mean your butler?"</p>

  <p>"He is my valet here," said Lowbridge with a smile. "Yes, I brought him;
  he was unexpectedly loth to leave me&mdash;in fact, offered to pay his own
  fare. In many ways I am glad, because I am not the best of sailors."</p>

  <p>"Benson believes in him?"</p>

  <p>Clive shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Benson is a man filled with admirable sentiments," he said. "It is his
  faith that no man is as black as he is painted. My own view is that Benson
  never defended a man less worthy than the doctor."</p>

  <p>He glanced curiously at Bill's costume. As usual, the reporter was
  somewhat oddly arrayed, and, conscious of his scrutiny, Bill laughed.</p>

  <p>"You've got to get used to this kit, Lord Lowbridge," he said, "because
  I've brought no clothes, and unless I can dig something up from the barber, I
  will be a disgrace to your party&mdash;if I were a member of your party," he
  added hastily.</p>

  <p>Clive was amused.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I cannot help you in the matter of clothes: you and I are not
  sized alike," he said, and Bill looked enviously at the fine figure of Lord
  Lowbridge, and felt again that little twinge of jealousy that he had
  experienced before.</p>

  <p>Bullott, most surprisingly, came to his rescue in the matter of clothes.
  He had brought a dress suit, which he did not intend wearing, so he said, and
  Bill found that the suit fitted him perfectly. Moreover, Bullott had a larger
  supply of linen than the reporter would have thought possible.</p>

  <p>"I shall be just eating around," said Bullott, when Bill protested against
  robbing him of his clothes. "And anyway, regular meals interfere with my
  digestion."</p>

  <p>Whilst he was dressing, a steward brought a message from Mr. Stone, asking
  Holbrook if he would join their party at dinner, and he was all the more
  grateful that he was presentable when he came down the stairs into the
  wonderful white hall, that looked like anything but the dining-saloon of a
  ship, and was greeted by the smiling eyes of the most beautiful girl in the
  world. Bill had never seen her before in an evening gown, and at sight of her
  loveliness caught his breath. The Thames mouth and the receding coast seemed
  very far away, as she indicated the vacant chair by her side.</p>

  <p>"How wonderful that you have come after all, Mr. Holbrook!" she said. "And
  please, you're not going to talk of Dr. Laffin or of any of the horrors from
  which we've escaped! I want to talk about ships, and this dream ship in
  particular."</p>

  <p>She chatted throughout dinner about the people who were on board. There
  was a returning ambassador, three great literary geniuses, a star from
  Hollywood who scintillated so brightly that she could not come into dinner
  until nine o'clock at night, when her sparkling splendours might be the
  better observed.</p>

  <p>"And there are twenty-five millionaires," she said impressively. "Mr.
  Stone counted them on the passenger list. Think of it, Mr.
  Holbrook&mdash;twenty-five! Doesn't it make your mouth water?"</p>

  <p>"I've yet to meet the millionaire that ever impressed me," said Bill.
  "They're homely folk, and I guess they hate being what they are."</p>

  <p>He looked round the great saloon; from every table there came the shimmer
  and glint of jewels, for the sea was calm and all chairs in the restaurant
  were occupied. Even the chronic neurasthenics, who feel ill at the sight of a
  ship, had plucked up courage to appear on the first night at sea.</p>

  <p>To the girl it was a scene of enchantment, outside and beyond anything in
  her experience; and even Bill was so impressed that he began to regret that,
  in taking away Bullott's clothes, he had also deprived him of this vision of
  loveliness. He might have been in a great Parisian restaurant; there was no
  motion, not so much as a tremor, save that his practised ear heard, above the
  talk and the soft strains of the orchestra that were playing in a gallery at
  the far end of the saloon, the distant whirr of the turbines that were
  driving them through the smooth blue sea.</p>

  <p>When dinner was over he fell in naturally at Betty's side, and went up
  with her in the little elevator to the top deck. As they walked out into the
  cool night air, a point of white light splashed for a moment on the horizon
  and was gone.</p>

  <p>"That is St. Catherine's," said Bill, "about the only light you'll pick up
  from now until Fire Island."</p>

  <p>She was looking at him with a woman's critical eye.</p>

  <p>"You are better dressed than I've ever seen you before."</p>

  <p>"And for an excellent reason," replied Bill cheerfully. "I am wearing
  another man's suit! I came on board with nothing but what I stood upright in.
  But have no fear," he warned her solemnly, raising his hand, "the barber has
  been true to type and has found me some shirts and other garments which I
  will not particularise. I shall not disgrace you&mdash;that is, if Bullott is
  content to go what he calls 'eating around.'"</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen him since I came on board," said the girl, with sudden
  seriousness. "Why is he going to America?"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't he?" parried Bill. "The man that hasn't seen America isn't
  alive."</p>

  <p>"But why is he coming on this particular ship? I thought he was so busy
  with"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"with this horrible murder. Was that story
  you told at dinner true?" she asked suddenly. "I mean the story about your
  fighting with a man in the Park and being arrested?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly true."</p>

  <p>"Who was the man?"</p>

  <p>"An acquaintance of mine." Bill tried to pass the matter over.</p>

  <p>"But it must have been somebody very hateful to you," she insisted. "I
  can't imagine you fighting for the sake of fighting. Was it the doctor?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Thank God!"</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?" he asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Because, if he is in London, he isn't here, Mr. Holbrook!"</p>

  <p>They walked to the rails and leant over, watching the glow of the
  phosphorescent waters.</p>

  <p>"Ever since I've been on this ship," she said at last, "I've had a fearful
  sense of being&mdash;what is the word?&mdash;shadowed! I don't know why, but
  all the time I am looking round, expecting to find him at my elbow."</p>

  <p>"Here, on this ship?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"You don't know Laffin as I know him," she said. "You'll never plumb the
  deeps of his malignity, of his daring. I still believe he is on this
  ship."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, I can reassure you on that point," he said. "Bullott watched every
  passenger come on board, and the doctor was not one."</p>

  <p>She shook her head doubtingly.</p>

  <p>"You do not know the doctor," she said, and at that moment Clive Lowbridge
  joined them and the conversation became general.</p>

  <p>As soon as he could bring himself to leave her, Bill went down in search
  of Bullott, and found him in his cabin, studying the passenger list.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked, as Bill came in.</p>

  <p>"Miss Carew thinks that the doctor is on board?" Bullott put down the
  list, took off his glasses and replaced them carefully in his waistcoat
  pocket before he said anything.</p>

  <p>"Maybe she's right," he said calmly.</p>

  <p>"Here, on this ship? He wouldn't be such a fool!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."&lt;7P&lt;</p>

  <p>Bullott's attitude exactly reflected that of the girl.</p>

  <p>"It looks foolish, doesn't it? On the other hand, you may be safer on this
  ship than in London. I am really advancing what will seem to you to be a wild
  theory. For a man who has been dealing in theories for weeks, and who has
  exchanged the safe haven of the Record Department for the kind of existence
  that I'm dragging out now, theories are almost as tangible as facts."</p>

  <p>He ran his fingers through his scanty hair and sighed.</p>

  <p>"It was a bad day for me when I took up real police work, Holbrook," he
  said sadly, "I'm a failure&mdash;at least I'm a failure if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If what?" asked Bill, when he paused.</p>

  <p>"If I don't find old man Laffin on board this ship."</p>

  <p>Bill sat down suddenly on the settee and stared at his companion.</p>

  <p>"Do you seriously mean that Laffin is here?"</p>

  <p>Bullott nodded.</p>

  <p>"He may not be here now&mdash;but he will get here. How? I'm not even
  guessing. I've got less idea how he'll get off."</p>

  <p>"I hope he comes," said Bill grimly. "I paid seven and sixpence for
  punching a policeman's jaw: I guess I can stand a few extra thousand dollars
  for strangling Mr. Blooming Laffin."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stone's party were in the cafe when he found them, and in that
  sparkling atmosphere all thought of the doctor and his devilry was
  dissipated. Looking up at the clock when the girl rose, Bill saw, to his
  surprise, that it was eleven. He had never known an evening pass so
  quickly.</p>

  <p>Before he went to bed he took a stroll up and down the deck with Bullott,
  and in the main the conversation was confined to America and its
  institutions. As eight bells was striking, he went down the broad
  companionway to his cabin, turned on the light and began to undress, trying
  hard to believe that twenty-four hours earlier he had shared a small cell
  with a drunken cabman.</p>

  <p>Getting into bed, he took up a book and read for a quarter of an hour,
  without recognising a single word on the printed page, for his thoughts were
  in a queer confusion, made up of Laffin and Betty Carew, of police cells and
  dark priories and cowled monks.</p>

  <p>He turned out the light and lay for a long time in the darkness, and must
  have gone to sleep on his back, for he woke gasping, and sat up suddenly in
  his berth. There was a squeak which was distinguishable from the creak and
  shiver of the ship&mdash;the squeak of a door handle turning.</p>

  <p>Before he had retired for the night he had placed a small electric torch
  within reach of his hand. He stretched out and gripped it, and, as the squeak
  was repeated, flashed a light on the door.</p>

  <p>It was open, and the light focussed upon a yellow, malignant
  face&mdash;the face of Dr. Joshua Laffin!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch45"
     name="ch45"></a>XLV. &mdash; "SIR JOHN AND LADY WILFORD"</h2>

  <p class="first">IN a second Bill was out of bed. The little alleyway was
  empty, and when he reached the longer corridor there was nobody in sight. He
  came back to his room, turned on the light and took observations. Immediately
  facing his own door was another. Should he knock?</p>

  <p>At that moment he heard somebody in the corridor, and ran out, to find the
  night steward.</p>

  <p>"Who lives in that cabin?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Sir John and Lady Wilford," said the steward, and Bill experienced a
  heartfelt sense of thankfulness that he had not disturbed that aristocratic
  couple.</p>

  <p>"Did you see any man running along the corridor as you came down?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," replied the steward, and then: "Has anybody tried to get into
  your cabin?"</p>

  <p>"Somebody opened the door."</p>

  <p>The steward walked down and examined the catch.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you didn't close it, sir." There was something in his tone that
  suggested that he thought Bill had been dreaming, and at this the reporter
  could not reasonably protest.</p>

  <p>He got into his old suit and went in search of Bullott. Bullott's cabin
  was empty; the bed had not been slept in. A water-bottle and a glass of water
  stood on the table by his bed; his overcoat was hanging on a hook, as was
  also his hat. Bill made his way on to the promenade deck, where barefooted
  deck hands were washing down.</p>

  <p>The quartermaster in charge answered his question in the negative.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I haven't seen Mr. Bullott. Not that I should know him if I saw
  him, but the fact is, I haven't seen any passenger. Maybe he's up on the boat
  deck?"</p>

  <p>The skies were growing grey, and the morning air was cold and keen, when
  Bill Holbrook mounted the ladder to the upper deck. There was no sign of
  Bullott. Not hesitating, Bill invaded that holy of holies, the bridge, and
  was promptly, if courteously, ordered down by the officer of the watch.</p>

  <p>"I've not seen any passengers," said that official. "He is probably around
  somewhere; passengers get in queer places. Won't you look for him again, and
  then come along again, and, if necessary, I'll report it to the captain."</p>

  <p>Bill returned to Bullott's cabin, but he had not come back. He went along
  and woke Stone, and told him the news.</p>

  <p>"Bullott disappeared? Impossible! He'll turn up."</p>

  <p>But though the captain was aroused, and the ship searched from stem to
  stem, there was no sign or news of the missing inspector. Bill went down to
  breakfast with a heavy heart, and the girl, who had heard from her uncle what
  had occurred in the night, seemed as much concerned. He had begged Lambert
  Stone to say nothing of the doctor's presence on the ship, and apparently Mr.
  Stone had been discreet in this respect, for she did not associate Laffin's
  name with the disappearance.</p>

  <p>"What can have happened?" she said. "Could he have fallen overboard?"</p>

  <p>"Quite impossible, according to the captain," said Bill. "I don't know
  what to think."</p>

  <p>"He will be found," she suggested encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he is making some inquiries in the steerage?"</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He has not been seen in the steerage, which was the first place the
  captain sent the third officer to search," he said.</p>

  <p>After breakfast he had news which was disturbing and ominous. It came from
  the ship's doctor, who met him at the head of the gangway.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd come along with me, Mr. Holbrook," said the medical officer.
  "You're a friend of Mr. Bullott's, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, a very great friend," said Bill quickly. "Have you found him?"</p>

  <p>"No, we haven't found him, only&mdash;come along here."</p>

  <p>He opened the door of Bullott's cabin, and at first Bill saw nothing
  unusual, until the doctor pointed. On the floor under his feet was the shape
  of a cat, stiffly extended in death.</p>

  <p>"This cat belongs to the steward&mdash;or rather, it belongs to the
  stewards' mess," said the doctor. "It sometimes followed its favourite
  master, and apparently followed Gibbon, who is Mr. Bullott's bedroom steward,
  when he came up to tidy the cabin. The cat got on to the bed and drank from
  that water." He pointed to the glass of water that was on the bedside table,
  which seemed as full as it had been when Bill had seen it the night before.
  In the daylight, however, he noticed a bluish tinge to the liquid. "This
  unfortunate animal took two sips, and that is the result."</p>

  <p>"Poisoned?" asked Bill.</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what poison it is, but it is a pretty virulent one," he
  said. "I have smelt it for cyanide, but it is something much more
  powerful."</p>

  <p>At that moment his own steward brought a bottle, and into this he
  carefully poured the contents of the lass.</p>

  <p>"I can make a rough analysis, but I doubt whether I shall be able to
  detect the agent used until we get to New York," he said. "Mr. Bullott had no
  suicidal tendencies?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," said Bill emphatically; "he was the healthiest and sanest
  man I have met. If there is poison in that glass, and undoubtedly there is,
  then it was introduced by somebody who wished to do him a mischief. Why was
  the water put there, anyway?"</p>

  <p>The steward volunteered the information that Bullott had asked him to pour
  out a glass of water before he left for the night, and to place an apple in
  readiness on a plate, as he was an early riser. The apple was gone.</p>

  <p>"He may have eaten that last night," said Bill, "but if he did, he took it
  out of the cabin."</p>

  <p>Holbrook opened the inspector's trunk and made a brief examination,
  without discovering any clue to the man's disappearance.</p>

  <p>"The thing is so peculiar that I think it ought to be reported by wireless
  to the police of New York and London." Bill had had a consultation with
  Lambert Stone, and together they went to the captain and told him of the
  presence of Dr. Laffin.</p>

  <p>"He is not on the ship's list at all," said the captain incredulously, and
  then: "Are you sure you were not dreaming, Mr. Holbrook?"</p>

  <p>"I'm quite sure about that," said Bill.</p>

  <p>The captain caressed his chin meditatively.</p>

  <p>"This other business about Bullott is rather worrying. He is a Scotland
  Yard officer&mdash;I knew all about him before he came on board&mdash;and he
  is the last man I should have thought it would have been necessary to
  protect. My officers, who have searched the ship, say that there is no sign
  of him, and I am afraid we must return him as having fallen overboard."</p>

  <p>"Or having been thrown overboard," said Lambert Stone emphatically. "The
  doctor has told you about the water in the cabin, and the poisoned cat?"</p>

  <p>The captain nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I don't like it at all. I'll be glad when we're past Sandy
  Hook."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, as if he had remembered something, he went into the chart house
  and presently called them in.</p>

  <p>"There was one curious event happened in the night. I see the chief
  officer's logged it. A steam ketch obstructed the fairway&mdash;you probably
  heard our siren go in the night. We just missed her by a matter of feet, but
  she swung in and kept abreast of us, in fact, so confoundedly close that the
  chief officer had to yell to the skipper to haul off, or he'd report
  him."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that a man could have got from the deck of the
  <i>Escorial</i> to the deck of the ketch without mishap?"</p>

  <p>"Quite possible," said the captain; "that is a fact that we noted. She
  went under our stern eventually, but kept up so well with the ship that it
  would have been possible for an agile man to have transferred from one boat
  to the other."</p>

  <p>Bullott was unknown to the passengers, and his disappearance occasioned no
  remark. There was, of course, a possibility that he, for some extraordinary
  reason, had, in his secret way, arranged to be trans-shipped in the English
  Channel, but if that were so, there was no reason why he should not have
  notified the captain of the <i>Escorial</i> that that was his intention. In
  this possibility, however, was a grain of comfort.</p>

  <p>"I am going to think that he did get off," said the girl resolutely, when
  she was told. "I refuse to be worried on this trip. Everything is so gorgeous
  that it is wicked to be unhappy."</p>

  <p>For Bill's part, he was glad that Betty Carew (he still thought of her as
  Carew) took this course. But in his own mind he had doubts as to whether the
  ketch supplied a solution to the mystery.</p>

  <p>"She must have been a fast traveller to keep up with the <i>Escorial</i>,"
  suggested Lowbridge when he heard this theory propounded.</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily," was Bill's reply. "The ship had previously struck a
  bank of fog and was running at half speed."</p>

  <p>The girl's philosophical attitude was one to be imitated; this Bill
  realised before the Sunday was through. He tried to put Bullott's
  disappearance from his mind, tried to forget even the sinister possibility of
  Dr. Laffin's being on board, though he knew in his heart that with the coming
  of night there was a danger of this man's reappearance.</p>

  <p>Betty Stone and her uncle occupied suite H. on D. deck, and his first move
  that day was to locate this exactly. In the course of the day he had reason
  to go to the purser's office, and was again reminded of the absence of
  Bullott when he saw the burly figure of a sailor sitting with his back to the
  door of the safe, a large Navy revolver strapped to his side.</p>

  <p>"Your friend has not turned up, Mr. Holbrook?" asked the purser.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think we shall see him again this trip," said Bill.</p>

  <p>The purser made a little face.</p>

  <p>"We don't like these disappearances at sea; they have to be reported, and
  some ships get a bad name in consequence. I know one of the Transatlantic
  boats that has got so bad a reputation for suicides that they can never get
  their full complement of passengers, except in the tourist season."</p>

  <p>Bill saw that the suite on D. deck would be a fairly easy place to guard.
  It was the cabin nearest to the broad landing of the companionway, and there
  were two entrances, which could be observed by anybody who sat on one of the
  settees in which the landing abounded. The suite comprised three single
  cabins, a sitting-room and a bathroom. Lowbridge was housed on the same deck,
  but two "blocks" away.</p>

  <p>Without saying a word to anybody, he decided upon his course of action.
  That afternoon, when tea was served on the decks, he was missing, and
  Lowbridge, who went down to call him, returned with the report that he was
  fast asleep. It is not a difficult matter to slumber in the afternoon on a
  ship; the real task is to keep awake; and though, when Bill was roused at
  seven o'clock for dinner, he was feeling livery and irritable, he knew that
  sleeping was an act of wisdom in a man who expected to be awake all
  night.</p>

  <p>Betty rallied him when he came down to dinner, but Stone, with an uncanny
  instinct, guessed why he had spent that beautiful afternoon in his cabin.</p>

  <p>"Thinking of sitting up all night, Holbrook?" he asked, when they were
  smoking a cigar together on the deck after dinner.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am," said Bill.</p>

  <p>"Do you think there's any danger to the girl?"</p>

  <p>"I'm pretty certain there is danger to somebody," said Bill, "and I've a
  particular desire that it should not be to her."</p>

  <p>"I've told her to lock both her cabin doors, and I don't suppose she'll be
  disturbed, but if there is any trouble you'll call me? I shouldn't like to be
  far away if Laffin started anything."</p>

  <p>Before taking up his vigil that night, Bill went out of his cabin, had a
  cold bath and came back to his cabin to dress. He found his steward putting
  his bed ready for the night.</p>

  <p>"We've had a wireless from New York, sir&mdash;I don't know whether it
  will affect you. I was in the chief steward's office when it came, and you'll
  be the first to get one of these&mdash;the other passengers get theirs in the
  morning." He put a slip of typewritten paper in Bill's hand. "What is it?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"It's a notification to all passengers."</p>

  <p>Bill read the paper. It was headed:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">Extension of Sullivan Act</p>

  <p class="note">The following cablegram has been received from the District
  Attorney of New York City. "The Sullivan Act, prohibiting the carrying of
  concealed arms, has been amended as follows: No member of a crew or passenger
  of any ship shall enter New York Harbour having in his possession firearms of
  any description whatsoever. Passengers in possession of arms of any
  description must hand them to the purser or to some other officer nominated
  by the captain of the ship immediately. The question of issuing licences for
  these arms will be considered on the arrival of the ship at New York."</p>

  <p>Beneath was a note from the purser:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"It is important that all ladies and gentlemen in
  possession of firearms should hand them into my office by midday on Monday.
  Failure to carry out these instructions will be visited with the severest
  penalty, and the purser earnestly advises every passenger to comply with the
  wishes of the District Attorney."</p><br>

  <p>"What is the Sullivan Act?"</p>

  <p>The Sullivan Act Bill knew; the amendment was not a remarkable
  phenomenon.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't affect me," he said, "for I'm not carrying anything more
  deadly than a Marmoosa cigar."</p>

  <p>He finished dressing and went to his post of observation. The late
  stewards eyed him curiously; one reported his presence to the purser, and
  that gentleman came up with the tactful suggestion that he should go to
  bed.</p>

  <p>"I'm sitting here for the remainder of the night. If there's any law
  against it, or if I'm breaking any ship's regulations, why, you can bring me
  before the captain in the morning," said Bill. "Otherwise, this is my idea of
  comfort, with the cool sea breezes blowing through the portholes&mdash;I've
  paid for ozone and I'm getting it!"</p>

  <p>"Don't you get it by day, Mr. Holbrook?" said the purser
  good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"There are too many people using it in the daytime," said Bill, and the
  purser wisely left him alone.</p>

  <p>The night wore on, and there was no sign of the doctor. Though he had
  slept through the afternoon, his head began to nod towards dawn, and it
  required something of an effort to keep himself awake, until the arrival of
  the early stewards relieved him of any need for watching.</p>

  <p>Before turning in he walked the empty deck, and, having swallowed a hot
  cup of coffee, which, he admitted, was a mean preparation for slumber, he
  went down into his cabin, intending to sleep. That intention, however, was
  never carried into effect, for on his pillow he found a letter. It was
  addressed in pencil and he knew it instantly to be in Bullott's handwriting.
  With a hand that shook he tore it open, took out a plain sheet of paper, and
  read:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Don't worry about me. I <u>have</u> got a good
  constitution."</p><br>

  <p>There was no signature, but it was Bullott's writing.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch46"
     name="ch46"></a>XLVI. &mdash; THE BLUE BOTTLE</h2>

  <p class="first">WHAT did he mean? The mystery of his disappearance was more
  intensified than ever.</p>

  <p>His first act was to carry the note to the captain's cabin. That officer
  was awake and was standing at the door of his handsome quarters in pyjamas
  and slippers, a big pipe clenched between his teeth. He took the letter from
  Bill's hand and read it.</p>

  <p>"I'm very much relieved," he said, "but I wish your Scotland Yard men
  would choose some other place for their disappearing tricks than my
  ship!"</p>

  <p>"Not <i>my</i> Scotland Yard men," corrected Bill.</p>

  <p>When he took the news to Betty, which he did as soon as she was up on
  deck, she was undisguisedly delighted.</p>

  <p>"I only now realise how much I've worried about poor Mr. Bullott," she
  said. "But where is he, Billy?"</p>

  <p>Now, if there was one word in the language which Bill Holbrook hated worse
  than any other, it was Billy. To him it meant goats and tin cans and French
  railway tickets, but now there flashed upon him the realisation that that
  despised word was one of the sweetest in the English language, and, but for
  the girl's obvious embarrassment, he would have mentioned his conversion.</p>

  <p>Looking past her, he saw Clive Lowbridge reclining in a deck chair, his
  hands clasped together under his chin, his grave eyes fixed upon them, and
  his conscience smote him&mdash;but not very hard.</p>

  <p>Later, Bill thought it was typical of the young man that he should come so
  straight to a question which others might have gone about with greater
  circumspection. It happened after lunch (how definitely are shipboard days
  divided by the meal hours!) and he was in the library, changing a book for
  Betty, when Clive lounged lazily across to him, dropped his hand on his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Come and have a drink," he said, "a soft drink," he added unnecessarily,
  and when they were seated and the steward had taken the order: "Holbrook, you
  are very keen on Miss Stone, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>Bill flushed. Even then he did not know whether it was not sacrilege to
  admit his affection.</p>

  <p>"I like her very much," he said awkwardly. "I don't know
  whether&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're keen on her, and she's keen on you. I hope so, at any rate. I'll
  tell you something&mdash;" he bit off the end of a cigar and lit it before he
  continued&mdash;"you are going to get a prize which I should consider the
  highest guerdon that any man could take from the hands of fortune."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to get a prize! Why, Lord Lowbridge, I think you're going
  rather fast, aren't you? There is no question about Miss
  Carew&mdash;Stone&mdash;being fond of me. She likes me, I hope, but that is
  all."</p>

  <p>The grave eyes were surveying him steadily.</p>

  <p>"It is a hateful thing to say, but I hope you're right. She's
  wonderful&mdash;you don't know how wonderful! I've known her so many years
  longer than you. I knew her when she was a little girl, so high! And if
  things are as I&mdash;am afraid, then indeed you are a lucky man."</p>

  <p>Bill looked round guiltily, as though expecting to find the girl at his
  elbow, ready to deny with every manifestation of anger that she could have so
  far forgotten what was due to her beauty, her grace and all the holy
  femininity of her (femininity being particularly holy to Bill at that moment)
  that she had any thought of him except as she perhaps might think of the
  steward or some other insignificant person.</p>

  <p>"I guess I can't even listen to a provisional congratulation," he said,
  laughing. "Has this discovery about Laffin made any difference to your
  position, Lord Lowbridge? I mean, the transference of properties which he
  effected by his forgeries?"</p>

  <p>Lowbridge shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I knew I hadn't got them," he said tersely. "That they were stolen from
  me by friend Laffin doesn't make the case any worse than if they had been
  gambled from me by my poor uncle. Even now I cannot believe that he was
  poisoned. Bullott must have made a colossal blunder."</p>

  <p>"I hardly think so," said Bill quietly; "Bullott isn't that kind."</p>

  <p>Clive Lowbridge shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what kind he is," he said shortly. "I confess I'm not very
  much impressed by this theatrical disappearance of his."</p>

  <p>For the life of him Bill could not defend his friend, for Bullott's action
  had struck him in very much the same way as Clive Lowbridge was now
  describing.</p>

  <p>"Have you handed in your gun?" asked Lowbridge with a smile. "I have an
  antiquated revolver, which is now in the purser's care. It is surprising the
  number of pistols that were on board; almost everybody seems to have come on
  the ship prepared to repel invaders!"</p>

  <p>Bill explained that he had not been troubled by the order. The purser had
  shown him his new armoury in glee that morning. Row after row of automatics,
  revolvers and strange German pistols which had come to him. Each had a label
  with the owner's name and contemplated address in the United States.</p>

  <p>He slept that Monday afternoon, and woke to find that the weather had
  changed. Heavy rain was falling, and a moderate sea was running, without
  greatly affecting the comfort of the <i>Escorial's</i> passengers.</p>

  <p>He went down to dinner with a lighter heart than he had gone on the
  previous night. If, somewhere on the ship, was Dr. Laffin, somewhere else was
  the mysterious Bullott, watching and waiting.</p>

  <p>When he went below that night to change, his steward waylaid him.</p>

  <p>"I'm not much of a detective myself," said the man, a little
  self-consciously, "but I'm what you might describe as an observer, sir; and I
  want to ask you whether you took out the stopper of your water-bottle before
  you went down to dinner?"</p>

  <p>The water-bottles in the cabins were held in a bracket and protected from
  dust by a small wooden stopper attached to a chain which was fastened to the
  wash-stand.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm sure I didn't," said Bill.</p>

  <p>"And <i>I'm</i> sure you didn't," said the steward. "Before I left your
  cabin to-night and put everything tidy, I distinctly remember putting in the
  stopper. When I came back late to-night, the stopper was out."</p>

  <p>"I haven't been to the cabin between dinner and now," Bill assured him,
  and went back with him to view the mysterious carafe.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly the cork was out. Bill lifted the bottle to the light. He had
  a quality, which is well known to oculists, the gift of colour distinction.
  To most people, white and something which is nearly white are
  indistinguishable. To Bill the difference was very distinct. As he held the
  bottle to the light, he saw that it was no longer colourless. There was the
  faintest blue tint to it&mdash;so faint that the steward failed to see it,
  and practically suggested that Bill was imagining things.</p>

  <p>"Take that to the doctor as it is. I don't suppose you've got anything so
  old-fashioned as a rat on board, but if there is anything living that you can
  try this dope on, do so."</p>

  <p>It was the colour he had seen in the glass of water from which the cat had
  drunk.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch47"
     name="ch47"></a>XLVII. &mdash; AN ATTACK IN THE NIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE doctor was in his surgery when the bottle was brought
  in, and Bill told him of his suspicions.</p>

  <p>"We needn't experiment on anything living," said the officer, as he poured
  a little of the water into a test tube. "I pretty well know the contents of
  the glass in Bullott's cabin."</p>

  <p>He named a drug which was unknown to Holbrook. "And I hope it will remain
  unknown to the world," said the doctor. "It is aconitine, one of the swiftest
  and deadliest poisons known. The tiniest dose, the fraction of a grain,
  causes death in a few hours. In fact, it is so powerful and deadly a drug
  that no safe dose is given in the British Pharmacopoeia, while the nearest
  step that has been taken to mark its value as a poisoning agent is to name
  the dose that can be given with safety as the two-hundredth part of a
  grain."</p>

  <p>He lifted up the bottle.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's sugar," he pointed to a filmy substance at the bottom.
  "Aconitine can only be given when it is triturated with some gritty
  powder."</p>

  <p>Bill waited while he made the rough test.</p>

  <p>"Aconitine," said the doctor briefly, as he put the bubbling test tube
  into a stand. "Now, who on earth is distributing that poison?"</p>

  <p>"Is it difficult to come by?"</p>

  <p>"It would be humanly impossible for you to get as much as a grain from any
  chemist. In fact, few chemists stock it&mdash;in proof of which I have none
  on board this ship, though this is the best-equipped ocean-going surgery I've
  ever seen." The steward had been dismissed after the doctor had taken the
  test in hand, and was waiting hopefully in the alleyway for news of the
  experiment and for that praise which he had every reason to think was his
  due. Bill compromised by slipping him a couple of bills as he passed,
  refusing to satisfy his curiosity.</p>

  <p>"I'll take it kindly if you'll keep an eye on my cabin and see who goes in
  and comes out," he said. "There'll be fifty dollars for you at the end of the
  voyage, and another hundred if you catch the man who doped the water."</p>

  <p>He had only slept very fitfully that afternoon, and realised, after he had
  taken up his post on the landing that it would require all his resolution to
  remain awake until the early hours of the morning. In his watch of the night
  before he had learned a few things which he did not know; he had made friends
  with one of the stewards who were on duty all night, with the consequence
  that he was served at intervals with strong, almost nauseatingly strong
  coffee, and this kept him alert until he heard four bells strike and
  corrected his watch.</p>

  <p>Whether the bells had some somniferous effect, or whether the mere
  movement to examine his watch had set in motion those toxins which produce
  slumber, no sooner had the last vibration of the bell droned beyond his limit
  of hearing, than he found himself nodding. Twice he woke with a start, under
  the impression that somebody was coming down the stairs from the upper deck.
  He looked up and could have sworn he saw a head suddenly withdrawn from the
  rail of the upper landing. Should he go up and see for himself? If he did, he
  would be deserting his post.</p>

  <p>The port side doorway was open. D. deck corresponded with a lower
  promenade deck, and he would have loved to have gone out and freshened
  himself with the cold winds of the morning. But he had set himself a task
  from which he could not deviate, and stolidly he sat, his eyes glued to the
  door of Betty Carew's state-room.</p>

  <p>He heard a slight movement above and, looking up quickly, this time saw a
  face. A wild-looking brute of a man, with unkempt hair; a face which had not
  touched razor for weeks was glaring down at him, the hands clasping the
  polished rail were big and grimy. Even from where he stood, Bill could see
  the broken nails.</p>

  <p>For a second they looked eye to eye, and then the man's head vanished.
  Bill was on his feet and one foot on the stair when he was recalled to his
  self-imposed duty by the sound of a tapping noise. It seemed to come from
  Betty's cabin. He crept along and listened; the noise was not repeated for a
  while, and then:</p>

  <p><i>Tap, tap!</i></p>

  <p>It was farther along, near to Stone's door.</p>

  <p>He tried the handle; it was locked. Then he rapped on the panel; there was
  no answer.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right, Mr. Stone?" he called.</p>

  <p>He heard the sound of a crash inside the cabin, and a voice crying:</p>

  <p>"Help!"</p>

  <p>Bracing himself against the bulwarks, he put up his foot and kicked at the
  lock, but the door had been obviously bolted on the inside. And now hands
  were clawing at the panel. He heard the slow movement of a bolt being drawn,
  and as he pushed open the door, Stone fell into his arms. His face was
  covered with blood, his silk pyjama jacket was clawed into rags.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake what has happened?" asked Bill.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said the other dully. "See if Betty is all right."</p>

  <p>Bill turned on the lights and ran into the private saloon. On the opposite
  side was the door which opened into Betty's sleeping room, and this was
  unlocked. He flung open the door and she sat up in bed in alarm.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" she asked, her hand at her throat. "Oh, is it you,
  Billy? What is wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Will you come in to Mr. Stone?"</p>

  <p>She stopped only to pull on a dressing-gown and was with him almost as
  soon as he had reached the wounded man. Stone was lying on his bed,
  recovering his breath.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what happened," he said. "No, I'm not hurt very badly. I
  wakened with somebody's hands at my throat. They were jerking me down into
  the pillow, and I think I should have died if someone hadn't
  interrupted&mdash;I suppose it was you?"</p>

  <p>"Who attacked you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. There seemed to be two of them, but perhaps it was only
  one. I can't tell you; the cabin was in darkness."</p>

  <p>"That is the way they came," Bill pointed to the porthole, larger than was
  to be found in most cabins. It was wide open and swinging.</p>

  <p>He searched the floor, and presently uttered an exclamation. Underneath
  the bed was a short sheath-knife, the handle well worn, the edge stained red
  with newly shed blood.</p>

  <p>There was a roughly-scrawled monogram on the handle, evidently cut by an
  amateur who had wearied of his work before it was completed. Bill carried the
  knife to the light and examined the markings.</p>

  <p>"There is an 'H' here, and half of another 'H.' Who is H.H?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody I know," said Stone, shaking his head. "I thought you were being a
  little romantic when you decided to sit up all night, Holbrook. In future
  you'll sleep in the spare cabin; I'll have a bed made for you."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Betty, wide-eyed. "'Romantic to sit up'? Have
  you been sitting up at night, Mr. Holbrook?"</p>

  <p>"I've been just loafing around," he said uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"He's been sitting up on the landing outside, because he thought there was
  some danger to you from Laffin. There is no sense in pretending that he isn't
  on board." She uttered a cry.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Laffin here!" Her voice was hardly more than a whisper. "I knew it, I
  knew it!"</p>

  <p>"Holbrook saw him the first night out, and he's been keeping observation
  on the cabin ever since."</p>

  <p>"That is why you slept in the afternoon, of course?" She dropped her cool
  hand on Bill's. "You're a dear!" Had Bill suddenly found himself invested
  with the Congressional Medal and the Victoria Cross, he could not have
  experienced a more poignant emotion.</p>

  <p>"You are a dear," she nodded, "and I never dreamt&mdash;does Clive
  know?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't tell Clive," said Stone. "It was at Holbrook's suggestion.
  He thought that Clive would wish to share his watch."</p>

  <p>"And I wanted all the kudos myself," said Bill. "I'm strong for kudos. It
  is the only word of Greek I know." The steward, who had come at last to the
  repeated ringing of the bell, went in search of the doctor, and by the time
  the medico came, Betty was dressed.</p>

  <p>"I'm going on the deck, will you come with me?"</p>

  <p>Bill was almost used to the aspect of the dawn, but to Betty the first
  loveliness of daybreak came with a magic spell.</p>

  <p>"The deck chairs are not put out," he warned her, when she was looking
  around for somewhere to sit.</p>

  <p>He found a deck chair, opened it and spread his overcoat upon it, but she
  stopped him.</p>

  <p>"I want to know something," she said, "and you've got to tell me the
  truth, Billy&mdash;you don't mind my calling you Billy? I feel I know you
  ever so well, and I can't understand why I didn't call you Billy from the
  first."</p>

  <p>"You didn't want to call me Billy at first," said Holbrook grimly. "I
  don't know what variety of language a lady uses when she tries to describe
  somebody very objectionable, but I guess you wished to call me that!"</p>

  <p>"I'm calling you Billy now. Where is the doctor?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't the least idea. I'm certain that he is somewhere around."</p>

  <p>"Does the captain know that he's on the ship?"</p>

  <p>"The captain has been told, yes."</p>

  <p>"The ship has been searched?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;from keel to&mdash;whatever they search it to, I can't think of
  the word," said Bill. "Nauticalisms were never my speciality."</p>

  <p>She bit her lip thoughtfully and sat for a long time turning the matter
  over in her mind, whilst Bill could frankly look and as frankly admire the
  perfect profile that was turned to him. Presently she sighed.</p>

  <p>"I knew the doctor would be here. He is going to America, of course?"</p>

  <p>"I think so."</p>

  <p>"I told Clive he would come, but Clive wouldn't believe it. But perhaps he
  knew?"</p>

  <p>"He knew, but I don't think he wanted to tell you. You were the victim of
  a very small and very innocent conspiracy of silence."</p>

  <p>"I knew. He could not be on the same ship or in the same house and I
  wouldn't know."</p>

  <p>It was only by the clasp of her hands one in the other that he realised
  the intensity of her horror and hatred of the man she called husband.</p>

  <p>"I have lived all my life under his shadow," she said. "He has been an
  oppression to every joy, a cloud to every ray of sunlight that has made my
  path a little more pleasant. To escape him I have toured almost every town in
  England, playing in the worst kind of musical comedies, enduring you'll never
  guess how many insults, living in lodgings that I don't want to think about.
  They were hateful, but I preferred them to the house in Camden Road. Why is
  he on the ship?"</p>

  <p>"You've already suggested that he's going to America."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It isn't that. Whatever happens, will happen on board the
  <i>Escorial.</i> The climax is coming here"&mdash;she pointed to the deck.
  "When do we reach New York?"</p>

  <p>"On Friday?"</p>

  <p>She made a brief calculation.</p>

  <p>"Three more days," she said in despair, "almost four! Mr. Billy
  Holbrook"&mdash;she laid her hand on his&mdash;"it was wonderful of you to
  guard me. Will you&mdash;will you go on doing it?"</p>

  <p>He nodded, finding a difficulty in speaking.</p>

  <p>"Your uncle suggested I should use the spare room in your suite," he said,
  when he had recovered his voice, but she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to do that; I don't want anybody to sleep; I don't think
  I shall sleep either. Why have all the passengers been asked to hand their
  revolvers to the purser?"</p>

  <p>"It is a new America law," he said in surprise. "Our people are always
  jumping in quick with new laws. I suppose there's been an epidemic of
  hold-ups.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head again.</p>

  <p>"Billy," she said quietly, "there is no such law."</p>

  <p>"But the purser had a wireless"</p>

  <p>"I don't care what the purser has had, there is no such law compelling
  passengers to surrender their revolvers. If there was a wireless, it was a
  fake, and its object is to disarm the men on the ship."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch48"
     name="ch48"></a>XLVIII. &mdash; A RADIO FROM NEW YORK</h2>

  <p class="first">HE stared at her open-mouthed, and once she had voiced her
  suspicions, their feasibility was obvious.</p>

  <p>"Come up on to the boat deck." He gripped her arm, and together they ran
  up the companionway. Halfway along the deck, at a place just behind the
  fourth funnel, was a little cabin. Billy had already explored this part of
  the ship very thoroughly, and, opening the door, he ushered her into an
  interior dazzlingly lit with thermionic valve lamps. The spectacled young man
  who frowned at this rude intrusion grinned when he recognised Billy.</p>

  <p>"I want to get this radio off right away," said Bill, as he sat down and
  began to scribble. "This is to the District Attorney, New York. 'Have you
  sent any instructions to purser of <i>Escorial</i> ordering that all pistols
  on board shall be deposited in purser's office under pain of imprisonment and
  fine. This is very urgent. Have reason to suspect hold-up on <i>Escorial</i>.
  Radio me immediately. William Holbrook, staff reporter, <i>Globe
  Herald</i>.'"</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch; it was barely three.</p>

  <p>"Please God the District Attorney keeps late hours. It is just after
  midnight in New York," he said.</p>

  <p>They went down to the cabin, where the doctor had put on the last bandage
  and was on the point of departure.</p>

  <p>"This is a matter that must be reported to the captain," he said. "I take
  a very serious view of these attempts, first by poison and now by knife, to
  murder the members of your party."</p>

  <p>"You don't take half as serious a view as I take," said Bill grimly.</p>

  <p>The officer of the watch, to whom the circumstance had been reported, came
  off duty at four and Bill had a long and earnest talk with him.</p>

  <p>"It was easy to get into the cabin," he said. "Mr. Stone's suite is
  parallel with the lower promenade deck. The glass has been cut and the
  porthole was open that way. You've heard no more of your friend Bullott?"</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No. But he is on the ship somewhere."</p>

  <p>"In which case," said the officer, "he must be no bigger than a flea, for
  we can't do any more in the way of searching this ship unless we have the
  paint washed!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe you'll find him under that," laughed Bill.</p>

  <p>He could only marvel, as the days progressed, how perfectly a ship's
  company keeps a secret. Not one of the thousands that travelled on that great
  vessel knew how near they had been to tragedy, or guessed the startling
  events that had occurred whilst they slept.</p>

  <p>"It is uncanny," agreed Betty. She was stretched on her deck chair in the
  hour before lunch, and the weather, varying its mood, gave them a sky
  unflecked with cloud and a sea as smooth as a pond. Clad in white from her
  chin to the tips of her dainty feet, she held one young man entranced. "I can
  almost believe that I've been dreaming myself. A woman has just told me that
  she never as a rule travels by this line because they use preservatives in
  the milk! She has brought her own milk this voyage, and her only worry is
  whether she has laid down a sufficient supply to last out to New York!"</p>

  <p>Bill said nothing. He was wondering whether these complacent passengers,
  to whom ocean travel was a scarcely noticeable experience, would have a shock
  before the stem of the vessel ploughed the Hudson River.</p>

  <p>"Another one told me that she never liked travelling in July because it is
  too late for icebergs. She says that she loves icebergs because they thrill
  her," said Clive.</p>

  <p>A steward came up at that moment, searching the passenger's faces, and,
  coming to Bill, caught his eye, and hurried towards him.</p>

  <p>"A radio for you, sir."</p>

  <p>Bill Holbrook carried the message into the shelter of the social hall and
  read:</p><br>

  <p class="telehram">"NO SUCH ORDER HAS BEEN ISSUED BY MY DEPARTMENT. SULLIVAN
  ACT APPLIES WITHIN THE FRONTIERS OF THE UNITED STATES."</p><br>

  <p>It was signed by the District Attorney. Bill read the message again. What
  should he do? The first step was to interview the purser. He found that
  gentleman in his own cabin, very busy with the classification of those very
  weapons with which the message was concerned.</p>

  <p>"Read this," said Bill. "It is a reply to my wire to the District
  Attorney, asking him whether he had issued any order to the effect that
  passengers are not allowed to be in possession of pistols during the
  voyage."</p>

  <p>The purser, a stout, clean-shaven man, with the plump face which is
  peculiar to pursers, read the message and frowned.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand that," he said. "There is no doubt we had a radio from
  the District Attorney."</p>

  <p>"It was a fake," said Bill, "and I'm telling you something, Mr. Purser. It
  was faked by people who have a direct interest in disarming the passengers of
  this ship."</p>

  <p>The purser's jaw dropped, and then he laughed uproariously.</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" he said. "You're trying to get a story out of the ship,
  Holbrook. That won't do at all."</p>

  <p>"How do you account for this message?" asked Bill stubbornly.</p>

  <p>The purser read it again.</p>

  <p>"It certainly is strange," he said thoughtfully, "but naturally I can't
  act upon a private message. I had better see the captain."</p>

  <p>There was on the table, almost at Bill's hand, a long Browning pistol, and
  tied to the barrel was a small brown carton of shells. Bill looked at it
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I'll see the captain right away, Holbrook," said the purser. "You just
  wait here until I return."</p>

  <p>Bill strolled out of the cabin. The purser's office was empty. He saw that
  the position of the officer's bed practically covered one door, the chair in
  which sat the armed quartermaster effectively protected the other.</p>

  <p>"The purser is well guarded," he said to himself.</p>

  <p>There was a certain reminiscent ring about the words, and he repeated
  them. The purser's guard? What guard had he heard about, or talked about, in
  connection with ships? And then it came to him suddenly. "Second engine-room
  guard!" Tinker Lane, the betrayer of the Twenty-Third Degree of the Proud
  Sons of Ragusa, had talked about an engine-room guard! That was a matter
  which needed thinking out. He got back to the purser's cabin a little in
  advance of the officer himself.</p>

  <p>"I've seen the captain," said the purser. "He is sending another radio to
  New York, but in any case he thinks it is just as well if we keep these
  pistols until we reach port&mdash;what do passengers want guns for, anyway?"
  he demanded. "The captain thinks that, so long as we've got arms in the
  ship's store, there's no reason to worry about your hold-up suggestion."</p>

  <p>"Where is the ship's store?"</p>

  <p>"Back of the chart-room," said the purser. "We've got enough rifles and
  revolvers to run a war!"</p>

  <p>"I see," said Bill. "You may be sorry, Mr. Purser&mdash;darned
  sorry&mdash;before this trip is through, that you didn't take my advice."</p>

  <p>And then he strolled out to the deck, and did not tell the girl the
  contents of the radio message until they were alone.</p>

  <p>"They're so very satisfied that all things are for the best in the best of
  possible ships that I don't think it is possible we shall shake their faith.
  The thing is to leave them to it."</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>"It is quite a horrible idea&mdash;I mean that there are no arms on the
  ship except those in a store which may be rushed at any moment!" she said,
  and he could only agree.</p>

  <p>Going down to lunch, they joined the little group that stood before the
  bulletin board at the head of the companion way. It was covered with sheets
  of typewritten news that had been received during the night. There was the
  usual story of a Pittsburg heiress who was divorcing her husband, the
  inevitable rail accident in France, a speech by the Chancellor of the
  Exchequer&mdash;the news was English, and would remain English till the
  morrow, when Cape Cod would colour the bulletins with tales of
  chorus-girl-millionaire marriages, risings in Mexico and fluctuations in the
  price of cotton. One message interested Bill and he stayed behind to read
  it.</p>

  <p>"Spanish police report the disappearance from Bilboa, under suspicious
  circumstances, of oil-tanker <i>Thomas Inland</i>. During night, when captain
  and officers were ashore, vessel put out to sea without authority and has not
  been sighted since. The Spanish gunboat <i>Alfonso XIII</i> is searching for
  the ship, but the weather in the bay is foggy-"</p>

  <p>He was going down to ponder this matter, when a man from the purser's
  department pinned up two supplementary messages, and one of these was
  headed:</p>

  <p class="headline">"The Missing Ship"</p>

  <p class="note">"No further news has been heard of the oil-tanker. It is
  believed that some English sailors who have been living at Bilboa are
  responsible, and that the man who organised the theft was a Captain Harvey
  Hale, who is being sought for by the English police."</p><br>

  <p>"Harvey Hale"&mdash;H.H.! Bill gasped as the full understanding of those
  initials on the knife came to him. Was Harvey Hale on board the ship? If he
  were, what connection was there in this adventure of Laffin's, with the
  stolen tanker at Bilboa? The letter "H" was not an uncommon initial; there
  might be a dozen people on board who could lay claim to it. But the
  coincidence was very striking.</p>

  <p>Smooth as was the sea, there was just the hint of a swell, and this had
  been sufficient to send Clive Lowbridge to his cabin.</p>

  <p>"Clive thinks that his coffee was tampered with this morning," said Betty.
  They were alone at the table, for Lambert Stone was too shaken to appear that
  day.</p>

  <p>"I expect we shall all be hypochondriacs, or imitating the Sultan of
  Turkey, who has his food tasted by an official poison-proof varlet before he
  eats anything, before we reach New York," said Bill.</p>

  <p>She was very serious and a thought pale. He wondered whether she shared
  Clive Lowbridge's objection to the slight roll of the big vessel. But when he
  asked her tactfully if she would like to cut out two courses and go on to the
  deck, she declined.</p>

  <p>"You can cut out the course, if you want. But it is more comfortable here.
  Besides, I want to talk&mdash;I always want to talk when I meet you," she
  added, a little ruefully. "Billy, I'm going to be an heiress after all, and
  against my will." And then: "Mr. Stone thinks my father is dead."</p>

  <p>He was silent.</p>

  <p>"You think so, too, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Honesty compelled him to the answer. "I am afraid that it is true,"
  he said softly.</p>

  <p>"Poor father! And yet&mdash;he meant so little to me, Billy. He was as
  much a stranger as you were. Is there an instinct that makes children
  recognise their own parents?" Q</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," said Bill. "The only instinct to which children
  respond is that which makes them give love for love and care for care. That
  is how I have sized it up. If you give children affection and thought and
  sympathy, why, they return it to you, whether you're their father or their
  mother or their uncle or their cousin ninth removed. If you give them
  justice, they'll give you justice. A child is a mirror."</p>

  <p>"You talk almost like the President of an Orphan Home," she said with a
  faint smile.</p>

  <p>"Don't I just? Children have been a study of mine. I don't think you need
  grieve too much. Remember, your father thought you were dead, and had ceased
  to mourn you&mdash;and anyway, had never known you or given you the chance of
  loving him."</p>

  <p>"I think I'll come up to the deck after all," she said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>While she went in to see whether her uncle had had his lunch, he walked
  along to his own cabin. The steward was nowhere in sight, and his hand was on
  the knob of the door when, looking up, he saw on the white enamelled surface,
  the print of a large black hand. He looked at it in amazement. Was that a
  warning? Turning the handle, he opened the door and stepped in. He took one
  stride, then stood like a man petrified.</p>

  <p>Lying on his bed, his eyes half-shut, his clothes in rags, was a man.</p>

  <p>For a second Bill did not recognise the haggard, unshaven face, and
  then:</p>

  <p>"My God!" he said. "Bullott, where did you come from?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch49"
     name="ch49"></a>XLIX. &mdash; BULLOTT EXPLAINS</h2>

  <p class="first">"SHUT the door," said Bullott faintly, "and lock it. They
  got me last night. It was my own fault. He told me to be careful, and, like a
  fool, I came on to the deck and Laffin recognised me, and one of his men got
  a knife in before I could pull a gun."</p>

  <p>"Laffin? Is it he you are speaking about?"</p>

  <p>Bullott smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you later," he said. "Is that door locked?" Bill assured him it
  was.</p>

  <p>"Who lives opposite to you?"</p>

  <p>"Sir John and Lady Wilford," said Bill. "I was asking the purser about
  them. They came on board at Southampton. Sir John is an invalid and his wife
  nurses him."</p>

  <p>"Ever come down for meals?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Bill in surprise. "What do you suggest? Who are they?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you that later, too," grunted Bullott.</p>

  <p>There was no need to ask where the hand print had come from; both his
  hands were the colour of soot and greasy withal.</p>

  <p>"You've been working in the engine-room," accused Bill. Bullott's face
  twitched.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've been greasing," he said laconically. "It is not so nice a job
  as you'd think, but I've got the constitution. Anything happened?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except that they've taken all our guns away on a fake message
  from New York. The purser has them." The man moved uneasily on the bed and
  winced with the pain of it. Bill would have sent for the doctor, but he
  refused that help.</p>

  <p>"It is only a cut&mdash;snicked one of the ribs."</p>

  <p>He showed the wound, which was more serious than he had imagined. Bill
  dressed it as well as he could, and when he had made the man comfortable:</p>

  <p>"Now, tell me what in thunder this is all about. To where did you
  disappear?"</p>

  <p>"I disappeared the night Sir John and his lady went overboard and their
  places were taken by Harvey Hale and Dr. Laffin. I saw the ketch in the
  fog&mdash;we nearly collided with it. It came alongside, and I was one of the
  few who were looking overboard at that hour, certainly the only man who saw
  two people slide down a rope and two others take their place, helped by I
  don't know how many steerage passengers! Quick? You've no idea how quick they
  were. They were in my cabin before I could return."</p>

  <p>"Incidentally they doped the glass of water that had been put for you
  there."</p>

  <p>Bullott nodded.</p>

  <p>"I heard about that," he said. "I went down to the engine-room. I thought
  I had better clear. And I hoped that my disappearance would lead to a
  thorough search of the ship and the discovery that Laffin was on board. I
  suppose you wonder why I didn't tackle him single-handed? Well, I'll tell
  you. He isn't single-handed, not by eighty! You haven't looked at the
  steerage, have you? The toughest crowd that has ever sailed out of
  Southampton. There isn't one of them that would be admitted to the United
  States."</p>

  <p>"Then why on earth&mdash;" began Bill.</p>

  <p>"Because they're not going to be admitted to the United States," said
  Bullott with a mirthless smile. "No, I'd already arranged through the Yard
  where I should go to, and the captain knew all about it."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" said Bill incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely sure. He's a pretty good actor, that captain. Most of these
  Yankee seaman have faces that won't tell on 'em! I've been greasing down in
  the engine-room and it is hell! The only time I saw you near to was when I
  looked over the rails. I've seen you in the distance a dozen times."</p>

  <p>Does the captain know?"</p>

  <p>"The captain knows all that I know," said Bullott, "but he doesn't take
  the same view that I take. You see, we didn't know enough, before the ship
  sailed, for Scotland Yard to issue any more than the usual official warning.
  They knew that an attempt would be made on the strongroom, but then, they
  know that every voyage, and take the necessary precautions. Where are you
  going now?"</p>

  <p>Bill had remembered that he had promised to join the girl on deck.</p>

  <p>"Wait." Bullott raised a warning finger. "You've not to tell anybody I'm
  here. The right people will find out soon enough."</p>

  <p>With this observation, Bill went back to Betty Carew, and it only needed
  one glance at his face to tell her that something unusual had happened.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to lie to you," he said, "but it is true that there has been
  an extraordinary development, but I cannot tell you what it is."</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do&mdash;anything?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all."</p>

  <p>The swell was more pronounced now, but Clive Lowbridge had managed to drag
  himself on to the deck, and fell gracefully into a chair by her side.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing romantic about seasickness, is there?" he groaned. "I
  feel that even Benson despises me."</p>

  <p>Benson, who stood rigidly by, with a rug over his arm, showed neither
  contempt nor approval. He was in all respects a model of a well-behaved
  servant. But when he tucked the rug about his master's legs, he did so in the
  manner of one who was saving a life.</p>

  <p>"You're a good sailor, Benson?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Madam, a perfect sailor. I have served at sea."</p>

  <p>"As a steward?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Madam. I have travelled many thousands of miles. Is there anything
  more you require, my lord?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, thank you, Benson."</p>

  <p>Benson made as though he were going away, but stopped and looked
  hesitatingly at the girl.</p>

  <p>"Would Mr. Stone consider it an impertinence if I offered to help him a
  little? I understand that he is ill?"</p>

  <p>"He had a bad fall," said the girl, that being the fiction that they had
  agreed upon. "I'm sure he would be awfully pleased of any help you could give
  him, Benson."</p>

  <p>With a little nod, the tall man disappeared through the companion
  opening.</p>

  <p>"Funny devil, that. I never know quite what to make of him," said
  Lowbridge languidly. "He's the most perfect servant I've ever had; he gives
  me no trouble; never asks for his wages at inconvenient moments, though
  they're low enough, heaven knows, and never so much as hints at his
  dissatisfaction with my humble estate. There are times," he mused, "when I
  think that Benson is too good to be true."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, what does our young journalistic friend think of things? Does he
  believe we shall be murdered before we reach New York? Billy&mdash;is it
  Billy?" he laughed softly. "Forgive me," as he saw the colour rise in her
  face. "He's rather a nice boy, that&mdash;I speak from the eminence of
  thirty-one years, which is a very lofty plane indeed. He's a nice boy, and
  if&mdash;if it was hopeless for me, I'd be glad if&mdash;there's another
  if!"</p>

  <p>"Don't say any more, Clive." She laid her hand on his arm. "The 'if' is a
  very big one just at present, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Which?"</p>

  <p>"The Laffin 'if'."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe he's on board, and if he is, why, it ought to be an easy
  matter to arrest him, the brute! How long do we stay in New York?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"In New York? I&mdash;I have the queerest feeling at this moment that
  we'll never reach New York."</p>

  <p>Clive Lowbridge raised his languid eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, Betty, don't get such horrible ideas," he said
  petulantly. "You're an awfully depressing influence these days. It must be
  your association with our crime expert!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I said that, and I know less why I felt as I did, but
  the idea of going to New York at all seemed, in that second, such an
  impossible one; and yet we are not more than three or four days from that
  city, are we?"</p>

  <p>"Ninety-six hours, to be exact," said Clive. "And there are sixty minutes
  in every hour. And when you are feeling as I am feeling at this moment,
  considerably more than sixty seconds in every minute&mdash;it's a horrible
  prospect!"</p>

  <p>Billy had gone back to his wounded friend and found him half-dozing. He
  had locked him in the cabin and carried the key in his pocket. The sound of
  the turning lock woke the detective, and when Bill opened the door he saw his
  hand was underneath his pillow.</p>

  <p>"Bullott, I'm going to bring the captain down to see you."</p>

  <p>"Don't," said the other laconically; "I've already sent him a note. And I
  can tell you, the captain is absolutely fed up with me. He regards me as a
  sensationalist who is trying to work up a scare. People say that the sea
  makes a man imaginative&mdash;rubbish! There is nothing so unimaginative as a
  seaman&mdash;otherwise, he'd never go to sea! He may believe in ghosts, and
  he may be superstitious about unlucky ships, but he refuses to see more than
  the barometer can show him. He's a man who deals with hard facts, with the
  relative position of the sun and the horizon, with the pull of currents and
  the habits of icebergs, the unintelligence of pilots and the extortions of
  harbour customs."</p>

  <p>"You seem to know a lot about it," laughed Bill.</p>

  <p>"I guess I do. I've been classifying criminal minds for years, and I've
  come across a few seamen&mdash;they're all alike. Holbrook," he went on more
  seriously, "if what I think is going to happen does, then there's going to be
  hell on board this packet. You've got to get the purser to hand over those
  guns to the people who own 'em."</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've tried and failed. And I don't think it really matters. Not a half
  per cent, of the people who carry a gun can use one. Haven't you read the
  story of the terrified passengers on the train that was held up&mdash;more
  guns than money, and three men skinned nine cars and got away without a
  scratch?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," said the detective. "In the meantime, go along and
  pinch a gun for yourself."</p>

  <p>Bill smiled and touched his laden hip pocket. He had not been in the
  purser's cabin for nothing.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch50"
     name="ch50"></a>L. &mdash; THE EVENING OF THE BALL</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was nothing unusual in the appearance of U.S.S.
  <i>Escorial</i> to suggest the imminence of a tragedy. The bugles called
  regularly to luxurious meals, the pillared swimming-bath echoed with the
  laughter of young people and the splash and gurgle of water. The band played
  in the social hall, where the elderly and the middle-aged preferred to take
  their tea. The smoke-room was crowded from afternoon till night, and the
  eight, or more than eight, crooks who worked this particular ship went about
  their unlawful occasions with skill and modesty.</p>

  <p>A fancy dress ball had been announced for that night: the notice was up in
  the hall, with the further information that dresses, masks, wigs, etc., could
  be obtained from the amazing barber, who supplied everything from shoelaces
  to surreptitious roulette wheels, for the comfort and pleasure of the
  <i>Escorial's</i> guests. As he was shaving Bill he offered his
  assistance.</p>

  <p>"I could make you up so that nobody would know you," he said.</p>

  <p>"Thank you&mdash;I'm in the publicity business," interrupted Bill.</p>

  <p>That night, after dinner, the centre of the social hall was cleared, and
  carpets rolled up, exposing a well-sprung dancing floor, and when the hall
  began to fill, and the trap drummer of the band made his presence known, it
  was difficult for Betty to believe that they were on a ship in the middle of
  the ocean, more than a thousand miles from the nearest land.</p>

  <p>The perfect harmony of the surroundings, added to the steadiness of the
  ship, which had galvanised Lowbridge to vigorous life, destroyed the last
  illusion of ocean travel.</p>

  <p>"It's very wonderful!" she breathed. He had found a tapestried sofa for
  her, coffee had been served, and Mr. Stone, a little pale but otherwise
  cheerful, had been assisted into a corner seat, his wound hidden beneath a
  black silk bandage.</p>

  <p>The air held a medley of perfumes which, by some merciful dispensation of
  providence, merged into one faint, sweet fragrance.</p>

  <p>"Why do you go so often to your cabin? One would think you had a sick
  child!" she smiled, when Bill came back for the third time.</p>

  <p>There was an opportunity now, for the band was playing noisily and the
  sound of voices and laughter made it impossible that he could be
  overheard.</p>

  <p>"Bullott is in my cabin," he whispered. "Nobody must know."</p>

  <p>When the dance had finished, she rose.</p>

  <p>"Take me on to the deck," she commanded, and he led her to the forward
  part of the promenade, which at this hour was bare of people. "Now tell me,"
  she said. "Bullott is in your cabin? Why doesn't he come up?" She listened
  without interruption.</p>

  <p>"He thinks something is going to happen?"</p>

  <p>"I won't deceive you&mdash;he does. So do I."</p>

  <p>"It's in the air to-night. I couldn't help feeling, when I saw those
  dominoes and masks dancing on the floor, how easy it would be&mdash;oh no,
  that would be too absurd. I'm thinking in terms of melodrama."</p>

  <p>"Melodrama belongs to the world," said Bill. "There isn't a police station
  that isn't full of it; there isn't an insane asylum that doesn't have it all,
  from Act One to the final drop."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see Mr. Bullott," she said suddenly.</p>

  <p>Bill was in a dilemma; he was already regretting that he had broken faith
  with his friend, but since he had done so he might as well hear the truth
  from the girl's own lips.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you down," he said.</p>

  <p>To his relief, Bullott was rather amused than otherwise at the sight of
  the girl.</p>

  <p>"I thought he'd tell <i>you</i>," he said, and she flushed at the emphasis
  he laid on the last word. "Come right in, Miss Stone, and find a place to
  sit. It isn't my cabin, and where Holbrook is going to sleep to-night I don't
  know."</p>

  <p>"I've come to ask you to tell me something, Mr. Bullott," she said. "Is
  there really any serious danger?"</p>

  <p>"Here, on the <i>Escorial?</i> Yes, there is some sort of danger for a few
  people here."</p>

  <p>"For me?"</p>

  <p>He looked perplexed.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;yes, I guess there is," he said. "You want the
  truth?"</p>

  <p>She nodded her thanks.</p>

  <p>"Is there any way by which that danger can be avoided? Can't somebody be
  told?" There was a hint of impatience as well as anxiety in her voice.</p>

  <p>"Why, no," said Bullott, considering the matter. "If we were travelling by
  railroad, there'd be an alarm signal that we could pull, and the train would
  stop and a policeman would come along and inquire. But nothing stops an ocean
  liner except a rock or an iceberg, or maybe, a man overboard; and they don't
  stop so long for that. We've got to go through with it. I've told the
  officers and they just looked at me as though I were not quite right in the
  head. My only hope is that I get a reply to the radio I've sent to Scotland
  Yard. That's the only kind of reply that is worth while."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Do you know Halifax? There are two British cruisers there, the
  <i>Sussex</i> and the <i>Kent</i>, fast commerce destroyers. I've asked for a
  convoy."</p>

  <p>Bill looked at him awe-stricken.</p>

  <p>"You never have, Bullott! You've taken a risk."</p>

  <p>"I'm taking a worse one," said Bullott. "I thought it out one night, when
  I was working down in that hot place"&mdash;he pointed to the floor. "It
  seemed the only thing that I could do. I've got the codebook with me that we
  use on special occasions. Fortunately, there's a code word for Kent and one
  for Sussex, so I could send it without letting the operator know what I was
  getting at. It was the last thing I did before I came in here. I was hiding
  all this morning, down amongst the mailbags&mdash;you wouldn't think I could
  get there, but I did. I had to run the gauntlet to reach this cabin. A whole
  lot of people didn't think I'd get here, either," he added, with a chuckle,
  "and not only thought so, but made it pretty hard for me to take that short
  journey. I've hidden in every kind of place&mdash;ventilators, bulkheads,
  rope stores, and if I'd been seen for the fraction of a second I'd have been
  a dead man."</p>

  <p>"Not this morning in broad daylight?"</p>

  <p>"This morning in broad daylight. Where's Benson?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Whom do you mean&mdash;not Lord Lowbridge's servant?" said the girl.
  "He's with my father."</p>

  <p>Bullott grunted something.</p>

  <p>"It's going to be some job," he said at last. "No, Miss Stone, there's
  nothing you can do for me, except to keep it secret that I'm back. I'm not
  squealing because Holbrook told you; I expected he would."</p>

  <p>He put his hand under his pillow again and took out a small Browning.</p>

  <p>"Ever use a pistol?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"In dramas," she said.</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope you won't use it in this drama. That's loaded. Can you hide
  it somewhere&mdash;in your bag, maybe," he said, looking down at the little
  bag at her wrist. "That's good! Don't forget that it is loaded, and push down
  the safety catch with your thumb before you press the trigger. You've nine
  chances there."</p>

  <p>Her face was white.</p>

  <p>"Are you armed also?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But don't you think I ought to tell Mr. Stone?"</p>

  <p>He considered this, and decided against such a course.</p>

  <p>"The fewer people know, the better. It might have been wiser to have told
  the passengers in the first place, but I did not know in time&mdash;you can
  leave the key on the inside; I think I can lock and unlock it now. My wound
  is much easier."</p>

  <p>They heard the door locked as they turned into the alleyway.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think?" she asked, as they reached the deck.</p>

  <p>"I've been wondering rather what to think," said Bill.</p>

  <p>"You mean if I'm frightened? I was a little bit, but not now. If I only
  knew where the danger was coming from, and exactly how it threatens"</p>

  <p>"I feel that way myself," said Bill. "It's the uncertainty of it, the
  nervous expectation of attack from all sides that rattles me." He drew a long
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Why that sigh?" she asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm wondering about the <i>Sussex</i> and the <i>Kent.</i> Warships are a
  hobby of mine," he said.</p>

  <p>All that night Bill sat aloof, literally his back to the wall, watching
  every point, every move, ready keyed up to deal with the blow when it struck.
  Dancing went on until after midnight; it was one o'clock before the last
  reveller had departed from the palm court, nearly two before the doors of the
  smoke-room closed and the cleaners came to their work.</p>

  <p>He had declined Stone's offer to sleep in the suite.</p>

  <p>"I shall be much better outside," he said. "It's only a few paces to the
  lower promenade deck; I can watch both the doors and the windows," he
  added.</p>

  <p>The night steward saw him and grinned his respectful admiration of Bill
  Holbrook's eccentricity. At half-past two his coffee was served.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand why you always sit up all night, sir. You're not
  afraid of shipwreck, are you?" asked the steward.</p>

  <p>That explanation had never occurred to Bill.</p>

  <p>"Got it first time, son," he said solemnly. "I have a mad passion for
  dying well-dressed."</p>

  <p>The steward lingered to gossip, and Bill was not averse to his
  company.</p>

  <p>"I've never known a voyage like this; nothing's happened," said the
  steward. "Dead and alive voyage, I call it."</p>

  <p>"What do you want to happen?" asked Bill.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing," said the man vaguely; "only.... stewards like to see
  something doing. It doesn't seem natural for a voyage to be&mdash;well, just
  a voyage. You're an American, sir, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"I have that peculiarity," said Bill.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it strike you that things are very quiet on the <i>Escorial</i>.
  Of course, a fancy dress ball wakens them up a bit, but lord! nothing to what
  I have seen in my time. Why, I've known the smoke-room to be full from the
  beginning of the voyage to the end! That was in the days before the ships
  went dry," he said regretfully.</p>

  <p>After a while he made a reluctant retirement, and Bill was left alone.
  From time to time he walked down the promenade deck and glanced left and
  right. At least he expected some appearance of Laffin's men, and his nerves
  were on edge. But all that he could see was the empty sweep of the deck, and
  all he heard was the scrub&mdash;scrub&mdash;scrub overhead; the watch was
  making the decks presentable for the day that soon would dawn.</p>

  <p>Was he mistaken, after all? Had Laffin and his villainy so shaken him that
  he saw the doctor's hand in everything&mdash;he remembered the poisoned
  water, the midnight intruder to Stone's suite.... Bullott lying wounded in
  his cabin.... No, something was afoot&mdash;some diabolical mischief that he
  could not fathom.</p>

  <p>The second officer came down the stairs from the upper deck. He was
  wearing his heavy sea boots and had evidently come straight from duty on the
  bridge.</p>

  <p>"Can't sleep?" he said with a pleasant smile. "I'd like to change places
  with you!"</p>

  <p>Above him he heard the voices of the watch. The quartermaster was giving
  an order, and grumbling in lurid language at the inefficiency of one of his
  team. And then his heart leapt. He saw the door of Betty's room open slowly
  he saw her peeping round the edge of the door, and her smile reassured
  him.</p>

  <p>"I've just wakened up. Is it very late?"</p>

  <p>"Nearly four," he said.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I can sleep any more. Won't you go and lie down?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head, and, with a little nod, she closed the door, and he
  heard the lock snap. At any rate, he could walk on the deck for a few
  minutes, and he was glad of the respite.</p>

  <p>Yes, the watch were at their work, their long scrubbers moving leisurely;
  he heard the swish and swirl of water as it was thrown across the deck, the
  bubbling of the hosepipe&mdash;pleasant, homely sounds that filled him with a
  sense of security.</p>

  <p>He was wondering whether any reply had come to Bullott's radio, and
  mounting the companion he walked along the bridge deck and tapped at the door
  of the wireless hut. The operator on duty opened it for him.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! Any more messages?" he asked. "The old man properly turned you
  down! He sent a radio to New York to ask if you were batty. Haven't had a
  reply yet."</p>

  <p>"Have you got a message for Bullott?"</p>

  <p>"What's the good? He's not here, is he? He's the man that fell overboard
  in the Channel."</p>

  <p>"He's here all right," said Bill.</p>

  <p>He closed the door behind him and sat down on the operator's table.</p>

  <p>"There's no wire for you. There's one from Esyard, whoever that may be,
  and it is intended for the captain."</p>

  <p>"I think that is the one I'm waiting for," said Bill.</p>

  <p>"Can't give it to you, son," said the man briskly. "It belongs to the
  skipper. I'll give it to him as soon as he wakes. Yards of it!"</p>

  <p>"Do the words Kent and Sussex appear in the message?" asked Bill.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, you're a thought reader! Yes, they do! They're code though,
  aren't they? Otherwise it is a plain English message, I can tell you.
  Something about '<i>Kent</i> and <i>Sussex</i> proceeding immediately.'
  There's lashings of a code wire for the Captain&mdash;six pages of it."</p>

  <p>"My friend, you'll be wise if you wake the Captain and give him that
  message," said Bill earnestly. "You don't know what may depend upon it."</p>

  <p>The operator grinned.</p>

  <p>"I know what would happen if I woke him," he said; "life would lose its
  savour for three or four voyages. Hullo, who's that?"</p>

  <p>Somebody had knocked at the door. He unfastened the catch and threw it
  open. For a second he did not see anything, and then out of the darkness came
  a black shape, masked from head to foot; the two eyes glittered through an
  opening in the cowl, and the barrel of a pistol covered him.</p>

  <p>"Don't move, don't touch that instrument, or you're a dead man!" said a
  gruff voice. "In the name of the Proud Sons of Ragusa, I order you step out
  and step lively!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch51"
     name="ch51"></a>LI. &mdash; THE CONTROL</h2>

  <p class="first">THE curious mixture of pomp and argot would in any other
  circumstances have aroused Bill to merriment; but now, as something cold
  gripped his heart, he knew that the hour of crisis had arrived, and followed
  the operator to the dark deck.</p>

  <p>There were other cloaked forms there; Bill counted ten; there were
  probably more.</p>

  <p>"Get into that cabin," ordered the spokesman of the Proud Sons, and his
  companion obeyed. "Take off all messages that come, shoot anybody who
  attempts to open the door, and, if the worst comes to the worst, destroy the
  instruments and smash those valves."</p>

  <p>"All right," growled the other.</p>

  <p>"Where is your cabin?" demanded the chief spokesman.</p>

  <p>"Aft. What is the game?" began the radio man.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask questions. Take this man to his cabin and lock him in. What are
  you?" He was speaking to Bill, and Holbrook was happy in the thought that he
  had not been recognised.</p>

  <p>"I'm a passenger," he said.</p>

  <p>"Keep him here. Go forrard, you men."</p>

  <p>The mask who was evidently in command towered above his fellows, a
  veritable giant. Bill saw them moving forward towards the bridge, and
  presently they were lost to view. He heard nothing, till there was a cry and
  the muffled sound of a shot. One of the men who were guarding him said
  something in a low voice; what it was Bill could not hear.</p>

  <p>He guessed what had happened before two of the robed men came along the
  deck, supporting a limp figure, that in the growing light Bill recognised as
  the officer of the watch.</p>

  <p>"Put him in that second cabin."</p>

  <p>What had happened to the captain? His stateroom was immediately behind the
  bridge. Bill was to learn.</p>

  <p>"When the skipper comes to his senses, handcuff him and keep him locked in
  his cabin. Seventy-nine and eighty, go forrard and search his cabin for arms.
  The armoury is behind; I've got the key of that. Don't interfere with the
  stewards unless they get fresh&mdash;the passengers are to be kept
  quiet."</p>

  <p>A figure came running up the ladder and saluted.</p>

  <p>"Control established in the engine-room, sir," he reported.</p>

  <p>"Muster the deck hands aft," said the tall commander. "Go back to them,
  Sam, and say a few short words about what's going to happen if they give us
  any trouble. You know the line of talk that'll scare that trash."</p>

  <p>When they brought the injured officer along, they had pushed Bill back
  against the rail, and now their attention was directed to some happening
  elsewhere, he seized his opportunity. In a second he had slipped over the
  rail, and went down the stanchion hand over hand, and apparently his
  departure was not noticed.</p>

  <p>The watch had disappeared from the deck; evidently they had been
  shepherded aft. As he darted into the companionway, he caught sight of the
  night steward, and whistled to him softly. In a few words he told that
  startled man what had happened.</p>

  <p>"You people are safe," he said; "they may skin the passengers, but the
  stewards will carry on as usual. I want a steward's suit from you; can you
  fix me?"</p>

  <p>"Does the captain know?"</p>

  <p>"I guess he does know," said Bill, without troubling to explain. "This is
  a fact, steward, and there's no sense in asking questions. Can you get me a
  suit&mdash;if so, get it quick!"</p>

  <p>The steward led him down to an unused cabin, in which, as Bill suspected,
  he slept, contrary to ship's regulations. From a locker he produced a suit of
  white ducks, and Holbrook changed instanter. His scheme was a simple one. He
  guessed rightly that the pirates would take little notice of the ship's
  staff, so long as they carried out instructions. In this capacity he might
  have an opportunity of protecting the girl.</p>

  <p>He was no sooner dressed than he borrowed the steward's razor and
  lather-brush, and although he was clean-shaven, he made a marvellous
  transformation of his face, for he removed the rather heavy eyebrows that
  were a feature of his face. The change was so marked that the steward at
  first hardly recognised him.</p>

  <p>"I know a crook who used to walk past the man who was looking for him on
  the strength of shaved eyebrows," said Bill. "It is a little wheeze that I
  remembered in time. Now go forrard and see the purser, if they haven't
  already got him. Tell the chief steward&mdash;he knows me&mdash;what I'm
  doing, and ask the rest of the men to keep their mouths shut. This means
  money for them when we reach New York."</p>

  <p>"What are they going to do to us, sir?"</p>

  <p>The steward was less concerned with the fortune that might await him in
  New York City than with his personal safety. He was a man with three
  children, as he explained several times, and had a mother dependent on
  him.</p>

  <p>As soon as Bill got rid of him, he hastened to his own cabin, knocked at
  the door and Bullott opened to him, and stepped back in amazement at the
  appearance of this stranger. It took a few seconds for Bill to explain what
  had happened.</p>

  <p>"The ship is manned by the Sons of Ragusa&mdash;the Twenty-Third Degree is
  operating powerfully! I think I can keep myself hidden, but what of you,
  Bullott?"</p>

  <p>"They'll not hurt me," said Bullott. "They were chiefly anxious that their
  game should not be exposed before they came into action. I doubt if they will
  hurt anybody."</p>

  <p>He looked at Bill strangely.</p>

  <p>"Unless it is you," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"But why me?" asked Holbrook, genuinely surprised that he should be
  singled out of all the others for punishment.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," said the other, and then: "Your only chance is to keep
  out of sight and watch points. I don't think I should stay here if I were
  you."</p>

  <p>When Bill rejoined his steward friend, he found him talking with an
  agitated purser, and it said much for the efficacy of his disguise that he
  was not immediately recognised.</p>

  <p>"They have taken charge of my office," said the officer, when Holbrook
  made himself known. "So far there has been no bloodshed, although I've an
  idea that something happened on the bridge. I've had orders to keep the
  passengers in the dark, but to carry on the duties as though nothing had
  happened. There's going to be a panic amongst them if this gets known."</p>

  <p>"Where did the men come from?" asked Bill.</p>

  <p>"They were all in the steerage," said the purser. "I had my suspicions
  when we left Southampton that the crowd we carried forrard were a tough lot.
  What are you going to do, Mr. Holbrook?"</p>

  <p>"I've signed on as a steward for the rest of the trip." The purser shook
  his head doubtingly.</p>

  <p>"They will recognise you," he said, "that is, if they know you at all. You
  might pass muster here in artificial light, but the moment they see you by
  daylight&mdash;go along and see the barber: he may fix you up."</p>

  <p>The barber! Bill remembered the urgent importunity of that universal
  provider on the previous afternoon, and without another word went down to the
  deck where the barber's shop was situate, and found the worthy man in a
  condition of excitement, for the news had run like wildfire amongst the
  stewards that the ship was in the hands of a hold-up gang.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, but I can't be bothered now, Mr. Holbrook," he said irritably.
  "My God, what's going to happen to us if they scuttle the ship? And they'll
  think no more of scuttling the ship"</p>

  <p>Bill pushed him into his spacious cabin and shut the door. "If they
  scuttle the ship they'll drown themselves, and they've no intention of doing
  anything so stupid," he said. "Now listen to me! The only chance we have of
  beating this crowd is for one of the people on board who knows the gang to be
  free to move about. Produce your moustache, man, and make good your boast,
  that my own maiden aunt would not know me!"</p>

  <p>The barber was in no mood to assist the masquerade, but after a little
  persuasion, and the skinning of yet another note from the reporter's wad, he
  seated him in his chair, and for a quarter of an hour, with many fearful
  backward glances lest an apparition in black appeared suddenly in the
  doorway, worked on his subject. When he had finished, Bill gazed into the
  mirror, a truly astonished man.</p>

  <p>During the period he was in the chair, he had developed a pair of shaggy
  red eyebrows, and a short-clipped, red moustache; his hair was almost the
  colour of Betty Carew's, and was parted and curled in a manner repugnant to
  his finest feelings.</p>

  <p>"Gosh!" he said in wonder.</p>

  <p>The barber so far forgot his trepidation as to purr complacently.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't get that done better in London, sir," he said. "All you've
  got to do now is to come and see me every morning, and I'll keep your hair
  right."</p>

  <p>Bill eventually found the purser: he was deep in conversation with a
  masked figure that stood before his sometime office. Looking round, he saw
  the waiting steward and waved him away impatiently.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he snapped, when at last the parley was at an end. "I
  don't want to be bothered. Get your orders from the chief steward."</p>

  <p>"Come along with me to the chief steward, and tell him to do as I ask,"
  said Bill, and the purser's jaw dropped. "Who are you?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Bill grinned. It was then that he made himself known. "I want you to tell
  the chief steward to put me in charge of Suite H, Mr. Stone's cabin. Nobody
  is to know who I am, not even Mr. Stone or his niece, unless they find out
  for themselves."</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," said the purser; "I want to think this out! If you go
  down to the steward's quarters they'll spot you, and there's bound to be one
  of them in with this crowd and you'll be betrayed. You'd better use an empty
  cabin to sleep in at night, and keep as far away from the stewards' quarters
  as you can. Who is your own steward?" Bill told him.</p>

  <p>"Well, he can come on and help you. What do you think they're going to do
  with us, Mr. Holbrook?"</p>

  <p>"They'll clear the ship of valuables, and of course the fifty million
  dollars in your safe will be practically in their hands."</p>

  <p>"It is in their hands already," interrupted the purser bitterly. "They've
  got the boxes piled up in my office. But what can they do? They'll be
  caught."</p>

  <p>"Why should they be caught?" asked Bill. "You're arguing on unknown
  factors. This crime was inevitable. Sooner or later, it was certain that a
  ship would be held up in mid-ocean&mdash;it's the easiest thing in the world,
  easier than holding up a citizen on the East Side. A big ship, crowded with
  passengers, carrying millions and millions of dollars' worth of property, is
  as easy a prey as a hornless cow! Why, you do not even carry a
  policeman!"</p>

  <p>"They're working on the registered mail now." In spite of his stoicism the
  voice of the purser grew tremulous. "What a thing to happen!"</p>

  <p>"Do the passengers know?"</p>

  <p>"No, none of them, and they're not to know. Anyway, the passengers are
  only brought into contact with the stewards, the purser and the chief
  steward. You're an ocean traveller&mdash;what do the passengers know, anyway?
  They never meet the captain or the ship's officers; they'll go on and on,
  unconscious of anything wrong, until&mdash;" he stopped.</p>

  <p>"Were you going to say until the vessel reaches New York?"</p>

  <p>"That was what I was going to say," said the purser. "But shall we reach
  New York?"</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I doubt it. They'll know when the gang go after their jewels."</p>

  <p>"Why should they? The valuable jewels are kept in my safe; they're taken
  out every night. And the passengers' money is there, too," the purser
  groaned. "I've got orders to pay out any cash that the owners require, so
  that they shall not be suspicious, and the only change they've made is to
  prohibit the use of the boat deck. They've put a quartermaster at each
  gangway to stop people going up, and the elevator isn't allowed to work above
  B. deck." He wrung his hands in despair. "My God, what a horrible position!"
  he said. "Do you know what has happened to the captain?"</p>

  <p>"I can guess," said Bill curtly.</p>

  <p>"They've got four men in the engine-room. I don't know how many on the
  bridge. There are machine-guns covering the deck hands' quarters, guards on
  the provision store&mdash;everywhere, except where there's passengers to see
  them. The man who planned this was a genius."</p>

  <p>It happened providentially that the Stones' steward had been taken ill the
  night before, and the appearance of a new man excited no unusual interest.
  Stone, who was still far from recovered from the attack upon him, had his
  breakfast served in his own stateroom, and this morning Betty joined him. She
  asked sympathetically about the missing steward, and Bill replied in
  monosyllables. He was desperately anxious that the girl should not recognise
  him, and when Betty looked at his face and asked him to carry a message to
  himself, he blessed the ingenious barber who had so completely changed his
  appearance.</p>

  <p>The need for disguise was made apparent when he reached his own cabin and
  found two men making a very thorough search of the apartment. The bed had
  been thrown off, the wardrobe was open. One of the searchers turned to him as
  he came in&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Where's Holbrook?" he asked in a hoarse voice.</p>

  <p>Neither of them wore the conventional livery of the Proud Sons, and Bill
  guessed that those of the gang who it was absolutely necessary should be
  brought into contact with the passengers went undisguised so that the
  travellers should not be alarmed. Afterwards he discovered that the raiders
  had entirely dispensed with their robes after the first attack. Bill,
  watching the searchers, wondered whether they expected to find the missing
  Holbrook concealed underneath the mattress, but wisely decided that it was
  not a moment for facetiousness.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir; he hasn't been in his cabin all night."</p>

  <p>"Don't you go telling him we're looking for him," said the other
  threateningly. "You've had your orders, steward?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Bill humbly, and went back to Betty, with a note that he
  had scribbled between the cabins, and which she read with a puzzled
  expression.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Holbrook says we mustn't expect to see him for the next three days,"
  she said, as she tossed the letter across to her uncle.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stone read the note.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" he said. "What is he doing with himself? I'll go along to his
  cabin."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you'd better, sir," said Bill. He had cultivated a high
  falsetto voice that set Betty Carew's teeth on edge. "He said he didn't want
  to see anybody. I think he has had a radio from his office."</p>

  <p>The girl and her uncle looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he has some work to do," she said uneasily.</p>

  <p>Bill went on deck to carry up the girl's cushion and book, and the deck
  steward, whom he met, glanced at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, where have you come from?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Ask no questions," snapped Bill, "and attend to your own business."</p>

  <p>It was the only tone to adopt, and the steward fell into the natural error
  that the new man was one of the gang which he knew was in control of the
  <i>Escorial</i>. In the circumstances Bill could only marvel at the
  extraordinary discipline which such men as he displayed. By no secret
  confidence did they betray the danger in which these gaily clad men and women
  stood. It was no strange phenomenon, however. He had travelled in ships where
  suicides and murders had been committed under his nose, which he had known
  nothing about until he had read the report of the inquest.</p>

  <p>An idea occurred to him and he sought out the deck steward.</p>

  <p>"I shall be helping you up here," he said, trying to impart a world of
  meaning into his tone.</p>

  <p>The steward touched his cap.</p>

  <p>"All right, sir," he said. "Excuse me if I was a little short with you,
  but I didn't tumble to you."</p>

  <p>"None of the passengers knows?"</p>

  <p>The steward shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir; we've had strict orders to keep every bit of news from them. I
  must say," he said, with the reluctant admiration which the law-abiding have
  for the lawless, "you've managed the job very well!"</p>

  <p>Bill growled an acknowledgment of this unsubtle flattery, and busied
  himself with the requirements of the loungers.</p>

  <p>At eleven o'clock bouillon was served, and he helped the deck steward in
  its distribution. Clive Lowbridge refused the cup with a little grimace, and
  Bill smiled to himself when he saw, out of the tail of his eye, the
  ubiquitous Benson bearing a glass of seltzer water and a large biscuit to his
  master. The weather was not so warm as it had been. He saw the girl shiver
  and went down to her cabin and brought her furs.</p>

  <p>"How very nice of you, steward!" said the girl in surprise as he put the
  cloak about her shoulders. "Have you seen Mr. Holbrook again?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss, I just met him in the alleyway. I think he has been
  writing."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"You haven't to be a detective to discover that, have you?" she said.
  "Poor Mr. Holbrook carries the marks of his profession."</p>

  <p>"How?" asked Stone.</p>

  <p>"Have you never seen the ink on his fingers?" she asked, and Bill went a
  fiery red. Fortunately she did not observe his perturbation, and he hurried
  away, to examine in private his tell-tale fingers.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, there's no ink on them now," he said, as he scrubbed away the
  last blue stains viciously.</p>

  <p>When he returned, the deck steward called him aside and asked him to take
  up a tray to the bridge.</p>

  <p>"Your governor wants another bottle of whisky," he said confidentially,
  "and I'll be glad if you would take it. I'm not a nervous man,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Herein was to be the supreme test. If Laffin was in charge, the shrewd
  wits, no less than the keen vision, of that warped genius might reveal his
  identity. Apparently, stewards had no difficulty in reaching the boat deck,
  and he was not challenged when he carried the tray to the foot of the bridge
  ladder. A man whom he knew looked down at him.</p>

  <p>"Bring it up," he said curtly, and Bill obeyed.</p>

  <p>None of the three nondescripts who occupied the bridge wore either the
  robe of the Order or the uniform of officers. He in charge sported a brown
  Derby hat, and to add to the incongruity of his appearance he wore a pair of
  old golf breeches, thick woollen stockings and bright red slippers, which
  Bill remembered having seen in the captain's cabin. Any of the three might
  have walked out of a saloon on any sea front in the world. Sailormen
  undoubtedly; ex-officers probably, thought Bill, and toughs most
  certainly!</p>

  <p>He bore the tray into what had been the captain's cabin, which was now
  occupied by a big man, who turned his head as Bill entered. Harvey Hale!</p>

  <p>"Put it down, son," said the man gruffly. "All right below? None of the
  passengers squeaking, eh? What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"Smithers," said Bill immediately.</p>

  <p>"Well see here, Smithers, you can go tell your pals that they're all right
  unless they start any monkey business. You know me&mdash;you know my name,
  don't you? Never sailed with me, eh?" The new commander seemed piqued by the
  negative reply. "Harvey Hale&mdash;that's me. You'll remember my name?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Bill, saying what was required of him.</p>

  <p>"That's good. You can tell the world you've met Harvey Hale&mdash;one of
  these days. The big man with the big ideas. Get that right, son&mdash;the big
  man with the big ideas! When you're boasting about how you've met me, don't
  forget that! Harvey Hale, the Big Man with the Big Ideas!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch52"
     name="ch52"></a>LII. &mdash; CHANGED CONDITIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL looked at him curiously. The captain had changed for
  the worse since he had seen him last. He wore a pair of old khaki trousers
  and a golf coat buttoned up to his chin, over which he had a worn khaki
  overcoat which hung to his knees.</p>

  <p>Suddenly his tone changed, and he became severely practical.</p>

  <p>"Do you know a passenger named Holbrook? He was up here the other morning,
  but I missed him somehow."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I was looking after his cabin," said Bill. "I haven't seen him
  since morning&mdash;he's disappeared somewhere."</p>

  <p>The corner of Harvey Hale's mouth lifted.</p>

  <p>"And he'd better! That was a wise kid! Listen, boy, if you see him tell
  him to come right along to me. Just mention the fact that he's wanted by the
  captain."</p>

  <p>"If I see him I shall certainly tell him that," said Bill, emboldened by
  the success of his disguise. "Better take me for your steward, captain. You
  don't want all sorts of fellows coming up and down carrying stories. You
  never know what they will talk about."</p>

  <p>Hale seemed to take a favourable view of this, but, to Bill's surprise,
  would not come to a decision. From his attitude Holbrook was certain that,
  though this swaggering freebooter might boast of his position and his power,
  he was the subordinate of another, and had little or no real authority in his
  hands.</p>

  <p>That afternoon, Bill discovered that, if the secret of the morning's
  adventures had been well kept, there was a feeling of suspicion abroad. The
  careless gaiety of the passengers who thronged the deck was less marked. He
  saw grave faces, and one man, unknown to him, buttonholed him in the
  companion way and asked him if anything was wrong.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Bill; "what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Well, is there any trouble up above?" The passenger jerked his thumb in
  the direction of the heavens, but Bill guessed that he was referring to the
  bridge.</p>

  <p>"Not that I know, sir."</p>

  <p>"Somebody was hurt this morning," said the passenger, by no means
  reassured. "They say the captain's dead."</p>

  <p>"I've heard nothing about it," said Bill, and made his escape.</p>

  <p>The unobservant travellers could hardly fail to observe one peculiar fact.
  They came up as usual from dinner, to find a remarkable change in conditions.
  Betty, who did not leave the saloon until ten o'clock (she had waited on,
  hoping that Bill would put in an appearance) uttered a little gasp of wonder
  as she stepped out on to the deck.</p>

  <p>"We've dined very early," she said.</p>

  <p>It was quite light. Every horizon was visible under the grey skies. She
  looked at her watch.</p>

  <p>"Why," she said, "it is ten o'clock&mdash;ten o'clock at night and still
  light! And, my! how cold it is!"</p>

  <p>She woke the next morning shivering, and hastily pulled her fur coat on to
  the bed. There was a knock at the door, and the new steward came in.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to put on your radiator if you don't mind, Miss."</p>

  <p>"An electric radiator in July!" she said jerkily, for she was chilled to
  the bone.</p>

  <p>"It does seem queer," said the new steward. "I shouldn't get up, Miss,
  until this cabin is warm."</p>

  <p>"Whatever has happened? Why is it so cold?" asked the muffled voice of the
  girl from beneath the clothes.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Bill. "Probably because it snowed in the night.
  There's two inches of it on the upper deck!" He was one of the few who knew
  that for twenty-eight hours the <i>Escorial</i>, leaving her course, had been
  steaming at full speed northward into the frozen seas of the Artic!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch53"
     name="ch53"></a>LIII. &mdash; BILL HAS A PLAN</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was nobody on deck when, putting on all the thick
  clothes he could requisition, he went up and viewed the amazing scene.</p>

  <p>The <i>Escorial</i> had a maximum speed of thirty knots, and she had
  steamed considerably over seven hundred miles northward. He guessed that they
  were somewhere in the region of sixty degrees north. Every seat, every rope
  was coated with ice; the snow lay upon the rails, and gathered in little
  drifts in the well-deck forward. Far away, on the port bow, he thought he
  detected a small ice-berg. The weather was clear, entirely free from fog; the
  sea remained smooth, and except for the intensity of the cold, there was
  nothing to indicate that the ship was on an unusual course. Icebergs are seen
  in July down as far as latitude 50. They have been met with, in rare
  instances, as far south as 40 in midsummer.</p>

  <p>He had intended maintaining his disguise until something definite
  happened, but there was no longer any necessity for keeping his secret from
  Stone.</p>

  <p>Apparently the men in control of the ship had also realised that their
  presence had now become public property. Bill heard the rattle of winches,
  and, going forward, saw that the muffled hands were bringing up passengers'
  heavy baggage. Soon after, the purser sent for him, and ordered him to pass
  on the information that passengers might open their heavy baggage and take
  out what clothing they required.</p>

  <p>He had paid several visits to Bullott. The detective told him that so far
  he had not been molested, though the two men whom Bill had seen searching his
  own cabin had also made as thorough a search of Bullot's belongings.</p>

  <p>"This move certainly puzzles me," said Bullott. "I knew, of course, they
  were steering north last night."</p>

  <p>"There is a good reason," said Bill. "We shall be running into the fog
  belt later in the day, and whether we do or not, we are well off the regular
  track of shipping. Unless we happen to be seen by a chance whaler or one of
  the Greenland trading ships, we shall have disappeared from human
  knowledge."</p>

  <p>"But you can't steal a ship and hide it in the Arctic," protested
  Bullott.</p>

  <p>"They're doing it," was the laconic reply. "Here's another point,
  Inspector: the farther north we go the less danger there is to the gang. The
  only possibility of recovering this ship is by a surprise attack in the
  night&mdash;there will be no night from now onward!"</p>

  <p>"You mean it will be light all night, of course?"</p>

  <p>This contingency had not occurred to the detective.</p>

  <p>Bill's plan was already made. The key position was the wireless house.
  Once he was in possession, ten minutes at the keyboard, and all the well-laid
  plans of the Twenty-Third Degree would come to naught. But he had already
  noted that the wireless house was guarded; he had seen a man sitting in a
  deck chair near the door, and the operator was presumably armed. His only
  chance would come in one of those dense white fogs which are common in these
  seas.</p>

  <p>He hurried away to find Betty's baggage, and had singular good fortune,
  for the Stones' boxes were almost the first to come out of the hold. With the
  help of a steward, he got these down to D. deck and into the sitting-room, to
  Betty's joy, for she was shivering in her fur coat before the electric
  radiator, and Mr. Stone, with a blanket over his thin suit, was walking up
  and down the little stateroom, trying to get warm.</p>

  <p>"What is this, steward?" he asked in surprise, as Bill came in, dragging
  the first of the big trunks, and he could have fallen on his neck when he
  explained.</p>

  <p>The steward had something else to tell, and after he had finished, Betty
  took him by the shoulder and brought his face toward the light of the
  porthole, more interested in the change that the ingenious barber had brought
  about than in her own deadly peril.</p>

  <p>"It isn't you, Billy?" she said, in wonder. "Your hair"</p>

  <p>"It will take me years to get out the henna!" groaned Bill. "No man has
  ever made such a sacrifice for a girl as I have made for you."</p>

  <p>She dropped her hand from his shoulder, and for a moment was convulsed
  with silent laughter. Mr. Stone, however, was less amused.</p>

  <p>"Where do we finish&mdash;at the North Pole?" he asked. "Why, this is
  criminal! Half the wretched passengers will die of cold and starvation."</p>

  <p>"They will be all right so long as the oil lasts," said Bill, "but what
  will happen if we get frozen in, and the oil supply goes west, I shudder to
  think about."</p>

  <p>"But the food?"</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't think there's any immediate danger there. Did I ever tell you
  about Toby Marsh's mystery? He said that food and firearms were being shipped
  to New York. Well, that was part of the scheme. Somewhere in the hold is a
  big supply of canned food and flour. The arms, I presume, are rifles and
  munitions for the gang&mdash;it would have been pretty difficult for them to
  have brought these on board in any other way."</p>

  <p>"But, Billy, you're wonderful!" She was gazing spellbound into his face.
  "Where are your other eyebrows. And to think that you've been coming in and
  out of the cabin since yesterday morning, and I haven't recognised you!"</p>

  <p>He helped them to unpack, and Stone went off to find Lowbridge, whose one
  trunk the new steward had retrieved. All Clive's radiators were on; he was
  wearing a heavy, fur-lined coat.</p>

  <p>"Benson is providence!" he exclaimed. "I've been roasting him ever since
  we left town for bringing this incubus, but he had an idea that the nights in
  America were cold, and insisted upon taking it along. I didn't know I had it
  until I saw it hanging in the wardrobe."</p>

  <p>"One would almost think that Benson expected a visit to the Artie Circle,"
  said Stone drily.</p>

  <p>Clive scratched his chin thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"That didn't occur to me, but it certainly is a remarkable coincidence. I
  should never suspect anything of&mdash;by Jove, I wonder!"</p>

  <p>He looked at Stone, and Stone's eyes surveyed the providential fur-lined
  coat with a reflective eye. As he was going out he met Benson. The valet wore
  two heavy sweaters under his coat, and gave him, in his customary respectful
  way, a sedate good-morning.</p>

  <p>"You seem to have been prepared for this cold spell, Benson?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, it is rather remarkable that the weather should change. When do
  we reach New York, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to be able to tell you," said Stone.</p>

  <p>He went back to Bill, and behind the bolted door there was a council of
  war, the third member of which was the girl. Stone told the story of the fur
  coat.</p>

  <p>"Clive ought to know," she said, but here Bill was firm.</p>

  <p>"In ordinary circumstances I should say yes," he replied, "but Lord
  Lowbridge has a servant, whose foresight is a little disturbing. I don't
  think that he should know who I am. Why should Benson imagine that it would
  be cold in America? He has been there before."</p>

  <p>"That certainly looks fishy," said Stone thoughtfully. "Benson is a queer
  bird&mdash;those quiet, suave men are usually deep. What are we to do,
  Holbrook?"</p>

  <p>"I'll agree to another man being brought into our confidence. If you don't
  mind, I would like you to go along and see the ship's doctor, whose help will
  be necessary if my scheme is to be successful."</p>

  <p>When Stone had gone and he was alone with the girl. "Betty&mdash;I'm going
  to call you Betty&mdash;you don't mind?" She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You have that pistol which Bullott gave you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"And if necessary you will use it&mdash;on anybody who attempts to harm
  you... yes, there is that possibility. Laffin is aboard, and is in control of
  the ship. He hasn't interfered with you or your uncle yet because he has his
  hands full with other matters. You told me the other day that you were to be
  an heiress after all; what did you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"I mean uncle told me that I was his only living relative, and his money
  must come to me eventually&mdash;he made a will in my favour before we left
  England."</p>

  <p>Bill nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"That accounts for the attack made on him. Laffin knows!"</p>

  <p>"But that is impossible&mdash;how could he?"</p>

  <p>"Laffin knows," he insisted. "He has sources of information of which we do
  not dream. You're Laffin's wife&mdash;if you are an heiress, he is the
  husband of an heiress.</p>

  <p>"Betty, if anything happens to me...."</p>

  <p>The look that came to her face hurt and pleased him.</p>

  <p>"To you?" she said, in a frightened voice. "Oh, Billy, nothing will happen
  to you?"</p>

  <p>"Anything is possible. I'm not trying to scare you&mdash;and I don't
  think, anyway, that you're easily scared. I wish&mdash;you don't know how
  badly I wish&mdash;to give you courage. But you have to face every
  possibility, Betty, my dear."</p>

  <p>He took her face in his hands and looked hungrily into her eyes. "I never
  dreamt&mdash;I never hoped&mdash;" he said huskily, and then, before he
  realised what he was doing, he had kissed her.</p>

  <p>The sound of a handle turning checked the torrent of words that came to
  his lips, and Mr. Stone came in, to find a very breathless, rather pale young
  man, standing awkwardly and guiltily before his niece.</p>

  <p>"Here is the doctor. I've told him a little," said Stone as he bolted the
  door. "He probably thinks I am mad&mdash;maybe you will be able to convince
  him."</p>

  <p>The ship's doctor, a man of middle age, was not as sceptical as Bill had
  expected.</p>

  <p>"I knew, of course, that the ship's course had been altered," he said,
  "and, in common with the purser, I learnt that these blackguards were in
  control. Mr. Stone says that you want my assistance. What is your plan?"</p>

  <p>Holbrook's scheme had taken shape that morning.</p>

  <p>"I must get into the wireless house. I understand radio fairly well, and I
  used to be an expert telegraphist," said Bill. "That was part of my early
  training when I was working in America. But to get into that caboose means
  that we must overcome the guard, and the only way we can do that and escape a
  fuss is to dope him."</p>

  <p>Dr. Speer shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If you gave them a slow dope it would take too long to work&mdash;" he
  began.</p>

  <p>"I don't want a slow dope, I suggest something swift and sudden,"
  interrupted Bill. "I expect they will allow me to go on the bridge to take
  refreshments. At any rate, I have asked Hale for the job. They have no
  regular steward except the men who are looking after their cabins on the boat
  deck. Even if Hale doesn't agree, I can go up without being
  questioned&mdash;and that I intend doing the moment we strike a fog
  bank&mdash;I don't care what they discover after I've sent the message."</p>

  <p>Speer pursed his lips; it was a new experience for a respectable medical
  practitioner.</p>

  <p>"Butyl is the stuff you want," he said, "and I have a quantity of that in
  store&mdash;I'll make certain. You will be taking a big risk, young man."</p>

  <p>"We are taking risks as it is," said Bill impatiently. "You do not know
  the men we are dealing with."</p>

  <p>The doctor went away, and returned almost immediately with a fluted green
  flask, the stopper of which was sealed.</p>

  <p>"Here is the stuff," he said, and gave Holbrook a brief lecture on the
  dose and method of administration. "I have not used it for a nefarious
  purpose, but I believe it is a drug commonly used by thugs who wish to bring
  their victims to a state of immediate insensibility."</p>

  <p>Bill slipped the bottle in his pocket and went out. It was not advisable
  that he should be seen too much in the Stones' cabin; they, of all
  passengers, would be most closely watched, and he more than suspected that
  one of the stewards on this deck was associated with the pirates. The man had
  made a sudden appearance on this part of the ship, and, when ordered to
  return to the steerage, where he belonged, had flatly refused. Later, the
  purser received an intimation that the man was not to be disturbed.</p>

  <p>In one sense his strangeness to the saloon portion of the <i>Escorial</i>
  worked to the advantage of Holbrook, for the steerage stewards had special
  quarters, and he was not able to judge whether Bill was a stranger or one of
  the ship's company.</p>

  <p>In the course of the day he made two visits to the forbidden deck, once in
  company with another steward, when they took up and opened a case of whisky
  for the use of the new officers, and once he carried tea to the quartermaster
  of the watch.</p>

  <p>He could not but admire the perfect organisation which had made this coup
  possible. Duties were being carried out without a hitch. A new set of
  quartermasters had appeared, and though the man at the wheel was no longer a
  neatly uniformed sailor, but a nondescript figure dressed in a soiled leather
  jacket such as is used by motorists, and smoking a short clay pipe, the man
  was apparently as efficient as the sailor he had relieved.</p>

  <p>It was on his second visit that he was the witness of a spectacle which
  would remain with him to the end of his days. He had not seen Laffin since
  the night when the apparition had appeared in his cabin. For some reason the
  doctor was keeping out of sight. But that he was on board and in command, he
  knew, and the position he occupied was revealed when Hale, watching the
  opening of the whisky case, had ordered one of the men to take a bottle to
  "the Commodore's state-room." Bill grinned inwardly at this description of
  his enemy. But how seriously Laffin took his duties, he was to learn.</p>

  <p>On his second visit he had put down the tray and had filled the teacups
  with steaming liquid, when Hale's voice called him into the charthouse. The
  big man was leaning over an Admiralty chart on the table, a pair of compasses
  in his hand, and an open book by his side.</p>

  <p>"Steward, go down to the purser and tell him I want a full list of the
  provisions on board to the last ounce," he said. "And ask him to break Number
  Four hold and get out all cases consigned to the Westbury Corporation of New
  York."</p>

  <p>Bill touched his cap and, going down, passed the instructions to the
  purser. He had guessed right about the provisions. How curious it was that
  Toby Marsh, knowing so much of Laffin's plans, had not revealed a little
  more, he thought, until he remembered that scene of reconciliation which had
  been witnessed on the Bath Road.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch54"
     name="ch54"></a>LIV. &mdash; IN THE WIRELESS HOUSE</h2>

  <p class="first">HE returned to the bridge with the information that he had
  fulfilled his errand, and that the list could be placed in Hale's hands
  before the evening. It seemed an opportunity, he thought, when he reached the
  boat deck, to make a reconnaissance of the wireless house. The guard was
  still at the door as he walked past; he saw the glow of the valve lamp
  through the cabin window.</p>

  <p>The wireless cabin was steel built and was sited on a raised platform. On
  three sides and near the roof were long, narrow windows of toughened glass,
  that nearest and facing the bridge commanding an uninterrupted view of the
  bridge companionway. All this he noted and memorised.</p>

  <p>Bill was curious to see how the gang had disposed of their prisoners, the
  ship's officers. He guessed that the big gymnasium was their prison-house,
  and his view was confirmed when he saw the two sentries standing before the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" one called sharply.</p>

  <p>"To the aft gangway, sir," said Bill.</p>

  <p>The man jerked his thumb towards the bridge.</p>

  <p>"Go forrard," he ordered.</p>

  <p>Bill was about to turn, when the door of one of the aft cabins opened and
  a man came out. For a second Holbrook gaped at him, paralysed with amazement.
  It was the figure of a naval officer in full dress; a gold-laced cocked hat
  was on his head, and the tightly-fitting tail-coat blazed with decorations
  and orders. A broad strip of gold ran the length of his trouser seams, and a
  naval sword dangled at his waist.</p>

  <p>For a moment he thought that he was suffering from some extraordinary
  illusion, and then the strangely attired form moved towards him, and Bill's
  senses were so strained that he could hear the creak of the enamelled
  boots.</p>

  <p>Under the man's arm was a telescope&mdash;but for that he might have been
  walking across the yard of St. James's Palace after a levee.</p>

  <p>Laffin! But a transfigured Laffin. His breast was swollen, his chin held
  high.</p>

  <p>"What do you want, my man?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Bill recovered his shattered wits and touched his hat obsequiously.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he said, in his falsetto, "but I was going to
  the aft gangway; they tell me it's closed."</p>

  <p>"Go forrard, my man, go forrard," said the doctor, almost pleasantly, and
  then, as he was moving away: "What do those folks think downstairs?"</p>

  <p>Now, 'downstairs' is a term that is never used on board ship except by the
  veriest amateur, certainly never by the admiral whose uniform Laffin was
  wearing, and Bill had some difficulty in keeping a straight face.</p>

  <p>"They don't know very much, sir. They're wondering why it has turned so
  cold."</p>

  <p>Dr. Laffin smiled.</p>

  <p>"I suppose they are, I suppose they are," he mused. "Whom do you look
  after, my friend&mdash;you are a steward, are you not?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stone, sir."</p>

  <p>The doctor's eyebrows went up.</p>

  <p>"Indeed? Mr. Lambert Stone and his beautiful niece? That is very
  interesting. And how do Mr. Lambert Stone and his beautiful niece accommodate
  themselves to the change? An experience for that young lady, one thinks, a
  remarkable experience!"</p>

  <p>With a lordly wave of his hand he dismissed the steward, and Bill breathed
  more freely when he had reached the deserted promenade deck.</p>

  <p>The passengers were now thoroughly alarmed. There had been something of a
  mutiny in the second-class saloon, suppressed ruthlessly by three of the
  gangsters who had been hastily summoned at the first sign of disorder.</p>

  <p>With evening a cold wind sprang up that made the deck a most undesirable
  spot. Those who had to run the gauntlet to the crowded smoke-room came
  shivering to the big fires which burnt at either end, and told stories of icy
  alleyways and cabins where bed was the only warm place.</p>

  <p>At nine o'clock, when the passengers went to dinner that night, they
  discovered that the menu had been cut in half.</p>

  <p>There was yet another development, favourable to Holbrook's plan. He was
  tidying the Stones' cabin when he felt the speed of the <i>Escorial</i>
  slacken, and, going up on deck, found the ship enveloped in a clinging white
  mist. Now was his opportunity, and, as luck would have it, he saw the deck
  steward carrying a tray toward the boat deck.</p>

  <p>"I'll take that," he said. "Who is it for?"</p>

  <p>"It is for the bridge," said the man, apparently relieved that Bill had
  volunteered for the duty. "The officers are to have hot food every hour."</p>

  <p>Bill went up the companion and put the tray on the deck. The fog was so
  thick that from where he stood he could not see the bridge or the wireless
  house. There was no time to be lost. His numbed fingers detached two cups
  from the dozen with which the tray was laden, he splashed in the hot coffee,
  sugared and milked the decoction, and then, taking the bottle from his
  pocket, he dropped a liberal dose into each cup. Taking one in each hand, he
  groped his way to the wireless house. The men on duty saw him coming and
  challenged him.</p>

  <p>"The captain sent you a drink," said Bill.</p>

  <p>"It's about time he did!" growled the man. "What's the other cup
  for&mdash;the operator?"</p>

  <p>He opened the door of the room.</p>

  <p>"Here's a drink for you, Arthur," he said, and the muffled figure of the
  operator appeared in the doorway and took the cup from Bill's hand.</p>

  <p>Not waiting to see the effect of the drug, Holbrook hurried back to where
  he had left the tray and carried it on to the bridge and into the
  chart-house. The bridge was now alive with men; he heard Harvey Hale cursing
  loudly the change in the weather, and then:</p>

  <p>"...it is only a belt, and anyway, we're more than fifty miles from where
  we arranged to pick up the <i>Inland</i>...." They were making for a
  rendezvous. This possibility had not occurred to Bill. Even as he thought, he
  heard another of the men speak.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to wait for her, won't we, captain? She couldn't keep up with
  us; none of these tankers do more than ten knots."</p>

  <p>"She does twenty-five," said Hale. "The <i>Thomas Inland</i> is one of the
  new fast..." The voice rumbled down unintelligibly, until: "...told them to
  rig up a dummy funnel and paint her white..."</p>

  <p>The <i>Thomas Inland</i>!</p>

  <p>Where had he heard that name? And then in a flash he remembered the
  wireless news bulletin that had been posted. The <i>Escorial</i> was to be
  met by the stolen tanker! So that was why the gang were so inactive. The
  tanker would not carry enough oil to supply the needs of the <i>Escorial</i>
  unless.</p>

  <p>Bill almost stopped as the horrible possibility occurred to him. She would
  have enough oil to carry the gang and their loot to safety! The
  <i>Escorial</i> was to be abandoned&mdash;driven into the ice-fields, and the
  three thousand souls she carried left to starvation and death, whilst the
  <i>Thomas Inland</i> made her innocent way to a port with her booty.</p>

  <p>He flew down the ladder, stumbled through the fog towards the wireless
  house, and had only to come in sight of the guard to know that the dope had
  worked. The man lay, an inert figure, outside the open door of the
  caboose.</p>

  <p>Bill did not hesitate; lifting him, he dragged him to the side of the
  ship, and, balancing the man on the rail, flung him into the dark waters.
  This was not the moment to consider the value of human life. Three thousand
  people were heading straight for a hideous death. It mattered little whether
  one or the other of the gang were drowned or hanged.</p>

  <p>The second man lay sprawled across his desk, and, hoisting him on to his
  shoulders, Bill staggered to the rail, and, without one tremor of regret,
  flung him into the unseen sea. The cups and saucers followed. In another
  second he was in the caboose, his frozen fingers working at the keys, a
  headphone clamped to his ears.</p>

  <p>As he called his eyes wandered over the papers with which the table was
  littered. There were messages from the English Admiralty and from the
  American Naval Secretary, calling on all ships to report the movements of the
  <i>Escorial.</i> Tappity-tap went the key restlessly, and presently he heard
  a faint answer, in the code of Cape Cod. He tapped off the message:</p>

  <p>"<i>Escorial</i> in the hands of gangsters. Position roughly 64 north, 45
  west, heading north. Notify <i>Sussex</i> and <i>Kent.</i> S.O.S."</p>

  <p>There was a pause, and then the reply came through:</p>

  <p>"<i>Sussex</i>, <i>Kent</i> and three fast American cruisers looking for
  you. Their position 60 north, 46 west. Notifying them."</p>

  <p>Almost as soon as the message finished he picked up another signal. It was
  from the <i>Kent</i>, obviously addressed to the distant <i>Sussex</i>:</p>

  <p>"Have taken message from <i>Escorial.</i> She bears north-east by north
  from me. Give me her direction."</p>

  <p>He did not hear the <i>Sussex</i> reply, but after four or five minutes
  came the <i>Kent</i> again:</p>

  <p>"Proceeding with all speed. Notify nearest American cruiser."</p>

  <p>Bill took off his headphones with a sense of elation, and at that moment
  somebody tried the door of the caboose, and a rough voice demanded:</p>

  <p>"What are you doing in there?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch55"
     name="ch55"></a>LV. &mdash; THE "THOMAS INLAND"</h2>

  <p class="first">THE caboose had three windows, one port, one starboard, and
  the other facing the bridge. All, however, were so placed that it was
  difficult for anybody outside to look in&mdash;for which Bill was truly
  grateful.</p>

  <p>He climbed up to the port window opposite the door, fumbled for the
  fastening screw, and, using all his strength, forced it open. In another
  second he was on the deck and running lightly towards the aft part of the
  ship. He knew that the companionway was guarded&mdash;he could not afford to
  take a chance of escaping the vigilant sentinel. To go past the gymnasium
  must also lead to detection, for men were on duty there. Slipping over the
  rail, he swung himself to the deck below. It was an eerie experience, hanging
  suspended there in the mist, and it required all his courage to swing inward
  and release his hold, for the fog was so dense that he could not see where he
  was landing.</p>

  <p>Would Hale suspect the steward who had brought up the tray? He must risk
  that too. Making his way to D. deck, he saw Stone for a moment, and, going
  along to the cabin which had been allotted to him, he hid the bottle and went
  back to wait developments. They were not long in coming.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he heard four short blasts from the steamer's siren: it was the
  signal to muster all hands.</p>

  <p>"This is where I become a stowaway or something" said Bill.</p>

  <p>He fell in with the other stewards on the lower promenade deck, and after
  half-an-hour's wait, he saw the towering bulk of Harvey Hale coming along,
  scrutinising the line, man by man. He stopped before Bill.</p>

  <p>"You're the steward who came to the bridge with tea, ain't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Bill.</p>

  <p>"What were you doing on the boat deck?"</p>

  <p>The very question told Holbrook that the new captain did no more than
  suspect&mdash;if he had known, there would have been no question.</p>

  <p>"On the boat deck, sir?" said Bill. "I don't know what you mean; I had to
  go to the boat deck to reach the bridge."</p>

  <p>"Did you come back to the promenade straight away?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"The man on watch at the foot of the ladder said you didn't."</p>

  <p>It was the moment for a bold bluff.</p>

  <p>"There was no man at the foot of the ladder when I came down, sir," said
  Bill.</p>

  <p>It was a desperate lie, but it succeeded. Hale turned, with a curse, to
  his companion.</p>

  <p>"That comes of putting a dirty longshoreman on duty!" he swore. "I know he
  wasn't there. He wasn't there when I came down myself!"</p>

  <p>"He was cold," said the other, his voice trembling. It was evident that
  the "officers" were in terror of their brutal commander.</p>

  <p>"Cold!" yelled Hale. "He could freeze for an hour, couldn't he?"</p>

  <p>A few minutes after, the muster was dismissed, and Bill went back to his
  cabin, a greatly relieved young man. The absence of the wireless operator and
  his guard had been discovered.</p>

  <p>The ship was now moving dead slow, and once everybody on board felt a
  shiver and ajar, whilst at about eleven o'clock that night she must have
  touched an iceberg; for a moment the vessel heeled over and Bill thought that
  the worst had happened. But there was some justification for Harvey Hale's
  claim that he was the greatest seaman in the world, for all that happened
  apparently was the merest graze, and scarcely bent a plate, and an hour later
  the ship ran out of the fog.</p>

  <p>There was ice everywhere&mdash;great masses of hummock ice like floating
  islands; bigger bulks that stood up from the sea like white cathedrals.</p>

  <p>By this time Bill guessed, rather than knew, that a vigorous search had
  been undertaken to find the men he had thrown overboard. Evidently something
  even more serious had happened, for an order came that the promenade deck was
  closed to passengers.</p>

  <p>The <i>Escorial</i> was now going at full speed, and in the grey light of
  midnight Holbrook saw, through the porthole of the Stones' cabin, that the
  sea was now comparatively free from ice.</p>

  <p>He snatched a few hours' sleep, and at five o'clock he was in the "H"
  suite sitting-room. Here was the chief danger: Lambert Stone was a doomed
  man. Twice in his search for easy wealth had Joshua Laffin been baffled. The
  murder of his patron had not brought him the money that he had every right to
  expect would accrue to him. His scheme to gain control of the finances of the
  Proud Sons of Ragusa had been thwarted by Pawter. To-day, for the first time
  in his life, there were untold millions in his hands, and the insurance of a
  rich wife, if this, the most desperate of all his deeds, should fail.</p>

  <p>He took along Lord Lowbridge's coffee, but might have saved himself the
  trouble, for Benson had forestalled him, and Clive, wrapped in a heavy
  overcoat, was sitting up in bed when Bill went in.</p>

  <p>"Benson tells me that the ship is in the hands of a gang. Is that true,
  steward?"</p>

  <p>"Quite true, sir," said Bill.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" An expression of amazement was on Clive's handsome face. "It
  doesn't seem possible. How far are we from New York now?"</p>

  <p>"About three thousand miles," said Bill. "Is there anything you
  require?"</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, steward. Have you had any news of Mr. Holbrook?"</p>

  <p>Bill had ready a new explanation for his own absence.</p>

  <p>"He must have found a warmer cabin&mdash;he complained about the
  cold."</p>

  <p>"Can't understand what has happened to him." Clive ruffled his hair
  impatiently. "You don't think he has fallen overboard?"</p>

  <p>"That is unlikely, my lord," said Bill, and got away from the cabin as
  soon as he could.</p>

  <p>Early in the afternoon, the <i>Escorial's</i> engines stopped, and Bill
  saw that they were taking soundings from the bridge, and apparently these
  were satisfactory to Hale, for presently the big port anchor dropped with a
  roar.</p>

  <p>And now, when the noise of the engines ceased, the perfect stillness was
  bewildering. The slightest whisper sounded like the sound of shouting.
  Holbrook understood for the first time what explorers meant when they talked
  of the "Arctic hush."</p>

  <p>Ice had again appeared; huge bergs were visible on every side. Two white
  seals rested on a floe that came slowly past the ship as she lay at anchor,
  and one of the stewards told him that, a few hours before she stopped, the
  <i>Escorial</i> had passed an enormous iceberg, on which a bear had been
  seen.</p>

  <p>The cold was deadly, and it was accentuated by the wind that blew from the
  north, that presently brought something like a blizzard, which covered the
  ship from masts to deck in a coat of powdery snow.</p>

  <p>His duty carried him to the purser's cabin. The stout man was shivering
  over his little electric radiator, and cursing the day that he had left
  Southampton.</p>

  <p>"Another three days' steaming and we pretty well clear out our supply of
  fuel," he said in a low voice. "Our only chance is to stay anchored. At any
  rate, there's enough oil on board to keep the dynamos going for two
  months."</p>

  <p>"At the end of two months what will happen?"</p>

  <p>"We shall be frozen in," said the purser emphatically. "I shouldn't be
  surprised if we didn't get iced up in a month! I don't know what they're
  doing: they're simply cutting their own throats coming here."</p>

  <p>Bill told him of the supply ship and the message he had sent&mdash;news
  that brought the purser to life.</p>

  <p>"It was you, was it? I heard all about it. They lost two men; what
  happened to them?"</p>

  <p>"They committed suicide," said Bill coolly. "Mr. Jackson, suppose the gang
  abandons us? Would there be enough oil to get us back to the track of
  shipping?"</p>

  <p>The purser shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If there was we couldn't make it," he said. "They've been all morning
  examining the engines with the idea of putting the machinery out of order.
  Oh, they've been thorough! By the way, the passengers are rationed for
  to-morrow&mdash;tinned beef and mutton, dried peas and beans&mdash;all fresh
  meat has been taken for Hale's men."</p>

  <p>The two days which followed were a nightmare to Bill. On the first of
  those, three passengers in the steerage died of cold and exposure, and on the
  following day a man in the second class saloon went mad and attacked his
  fellow travellers. The shadow of tragedy lay on the ship, and, looking up at
  her huge funnels and towering masts, and visualising the enormous bulk of
  her, Bill could pinch himself in an effort to wake from the fearful dream.
  The thing was so fantastical, so utterly impossible. Here was a ship, the
  largest in the world, stolen more easily than a sneak-thief could take a
  watch on a race-track! It was unbelievable.</p>

  <p>On the evening of the second day the deck steward came to him in a state
  of excitement.</p>

  <p>"There's a ship in sight," he said.</p>

  <p>"A warship?" said Bill, his heart leaping.</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, she looks like a tanker to me."</p>

  <p>Bill's jaw dropped. He knew, before the ungainly craft came slowly within
  a few cables' length of the liner, that it was the <i>Thomas Inland</i>, and
  that the supreme hour of danger was at hand.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch56"
     name="ch56"></a>LVI. &mdash; HARVEY HALE AND LAFFIN</h2>

  <p class="first">FROM the lower promenade deck he saw the ship come to an
  anchor, watched the lowering of a boat and the skin-coated crew pull towards
  the liner. A gangway had been lowered, and presently a man staggered inboard
  and went clumping up the steps on to the deck, being received by Hale, who
  took him straight away to the bridge.</p>

  <p>The consultation was a long one, and it was nearly nine o'clock before the
  captain of the <i>Thomas Inland</i> went back to his ship, and such
  passengers whose portholes faced that way saw her get up her anchor and sidle
  in towards the liner. She was made fast by midnight, and Bill waited to see
  whether his fears were well-founded. If the tanker passed a pipe aboard to
  replenish the nearly empty tanks of the <i>Escorial</i>, then Laffin's plan
  was something different from that which he anticipated. But no attempt was
  made to oil the ship, and, watching them, Bill saw the forward derricks in
  action. They were lowering on to the deck of the tanker the boxes which had
  been taken from the purser's strong-room. Bill waited only long enough to see
  this, then went back to Stone.</p>

  <p>The American was sitting despondently on a settee, a rug over his legs,
  his hands thrust into his greatcoat pockets.</p>

  <p>"Where is Betty?" asked Bill. It was not the moment for
  conventionality.</p>

  <p>"She's in her cabin&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>"I want her to come with me."</p>

  <p>He knocked on the door and Betty came out.</p>

  <p>"Put on your coat," ordered Bill, and, when she had obeyed, he led her
  along the alleyway to his own cabin.</p>

  <p>He had spent the previous night with an axe and a screwdriver. The
  brackets which fastened the wash-stand to the wall had been removed. He
  pulled at the piece of furniture and dragged it aside, disclosing a small,
  irregularly shaped aperture, heading apparently into a large linen cupboard,
  though it was now empty and had not been used that voyage.</p>

  <p>"Stay in this cabin until I tell you to come out. I will lock the door on
  you and bring you food. It is absolutely vital that you should not make your
  presence known. Should anybody try the door, get into the linen cupboard and
  pull the wash-stand to you."</p>

  <p>Before Betty could reply, somebody in the alleyway called Bill by his
  assumed name. He hurried out, locking the door and putting the key in his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"Where's Mr. Stone?" It was the purser. "He is wanted at once on the
  bridge, and Miss Stone also."</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen him," lied Bill. "Maybe he's down in the saloon or the
  drawing-room."</p>

  <p>"Go find him," said the purser impatiently. "That devil up above is
  raising Cain."</p>

  <p>Bill remained in the library long enough to satisfy the purser, and
  returned with the message that neither Stone nor his niece could be seen.</p>

  <p>"Go up and tell him yourself," groaned the purser, and without the
  slightest trepidation Bill interviewed the raging Harvey Hale.</p>

  <p>He was dumbfounded to discover that at least one member of the party was a
  prisoner. Clive Lowbridge sat in the chart-house, a dejected man, his wrists
  fastened with a pair of ship's irons.</p>

  <p>"Go down and tell that purser of yours that if he doesn't produce the
  Stones I'll cut his heart out of him!" yelled Hale.</p>

  <p>He had been drinking heavily, and in spite of his boast that liquor had no
  effect upon him, his voice was thick and his step unsteady.</p>

  <p>"What is this, what is this?" asked a testy voice, and, looking round,
  Bill saw Laffin entering the chart-house. He still wore his gaudy uniform,
  and though it was mainly covered by a naval greatcoat he contrived to show
  the hilt of his sword through a slit in the side of the garment.</p>

  <p>"That is not the way, my friend. I will have these matters done in my own
  way, which is naturally the best way. You are speaking of my wife and her
  respected relation. Let me send a message to her, a polite message, and an
  escort befitting her dignity. You understand, Hale?"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand anything," growled the man, "except that I want those
  people on this bridge and I'm going to get 'em here!"</p>

  <p>Dr. Laffin waved a dignified hand.</p>

  <p>"You are no longer in control. I, your Commodore, your Grand Master, the
  supreme authority of the Twenty-Third Degree...."</p>

  <p>Bill saw Hale bend forward, as though in the act of bowing. Then came the
  quick, bright flash of a knife. Twice the man struck, and with a cough Joshua
  Laffin, doctor of medicine, fell on to his knees, swayed for a second, and
  Hale struck for the third time. The old man went down, and did not move
  again.</p>

  <p>Thus passed Joshua Laffin, in his sin and his madness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch57"
     name="ch57"></a>LVII. &mdash; WARSHIPS</h2>

  <p class="first">"THROW it overboard," said Hale curtly.</p>

  <p>The shock of the deed had sobered him; his face was the colour of
  putty.</p>

  <p>"Step lively, damn you!"</p>

  <p>The man leapt at his word. Bill, standing in the chart-house, heard the
  click of the sword as it dragged along the deck... there was a loud splash.
  It was so horribly matter-of-fact a proceeding that Bill could not believe
  that he had witnessed a murder.</p>

  <p>"Now, young fellow, get down and tell the purser to come himself, and to
  bring with him the Stones, do you hear?"</p>

  <p>"I hear," said Bill steadily.</p>

  <p>"You're the man that was up here the night my two fellows disappeared?"
  Hale was looking at him with a new interest through his half-closed eyes.
  "What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"Smithers," said Bill.</p>

  <p>"Well, go down, Mr. Blooming Smithers, and come back with the Stones. I'd
  like a word with you."</p>

  <p>Holbrook gave a quick glance round; every man of the party was armed. He
  could have killed Harvey Hale then and there, but there were too many for
  him. He might shoot down three, he calculated coldly, but the fourth or the
  fifth would get him.</p>

  <p>"Here!" Hale called him back. "I want a wireless operator. Do you
  understand radio?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Understand morse, though, don't you?"</p>

  <p>It dawned upon Bill at that moment that in all probability the captain of
  the <i>Thomas Inland</i> had also picked up his message.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I don't understand morse. Several of the stewards do,
  though."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said Hale, and jerked his head.</p>

  <p>He was apparently not satisfied to let Bill go alone, for, looking round,
  the reporter saw that he was closely followed by two of Hale's subordinates.
  Despite his apparent coolness, his head was in a whirl. Joshua Laffin was
  dead! He met the purser at the foot of the companion stairway, and gave his
  message.</p>

  <p>"It's no use, Holbrook," said the man in a low voice. "I know where the
  Stones are. I went into the linen store, looking for a place to hide, and saw
  them. They wouldn't last a minute there. They searched that place when you
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>Bill's heart sank. He ran along the alleyway, opened the door of his cabin
  and called the girl and her uncle out.</p>

  <p>"I agree with the purser&mdash;you'll be found in the cabin. The only
  chance we have is on the boat deck," he said.</p>

  <p>As they walked along the corridor he told the news of Joshua Laffin's
  murder.</p>

  <p>"How horrible!" she said in a low voice. "Yet&mdash;yet my first
  thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He nodded and gripped her arm.</p>

  <p>"A couple of Hale's men are at the companion," he said. "We shan't have
  another opportunity of talking. I want you to follow me wherever I go. Have
  you the pistol?" She showed him the bag in her hand.</p>

  <p>"It is certain to be necessary; I hope it will be effective," he said
  grimly.</p>

  <p>He led the way along the deck, Stone and the girl following him, and the
  two gangsters bringing up the rear.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," he said, when they came to the foot of the ladder that gave to
  the boat deck.</p>

  <p>Stone went first, the girl after, then came Bill, and following him his
  two custodians. He reached the head of the steps, and, turning suddenly,
  dashed his boot in the chest of the nearest man. He dropped with a yell,
  bringing down his companion.</p>

  <p>"This way!" shouted Holbrook, and flew across the deck towards the
  wireless caboose.</p>

  <p>The man on duty at the door whipped a revolver from his pocket, but before
  he could press the trigger Holbrook shot him down. In another instant he was
  in the cabin, and the new operator did not show fight; he dropped his gun and
  put up his hands at the moment of their entrance.</p>

  <p>"Outside," said Bill tersely, and kicked him on to the deck.</p>

  <p>He dragged Betty into the cover of the cabin, and when Stone had followed,
  the reporter shut the door and pushed the bolts. With the butt of his pistol
  he smashed the three glass windows. He had seen that, from the wireless room,
  and standing on the operator's table, he could cover both bridges&mdash;a
  fact which one of the gang was to discover, for incautiously coming into
  view, Bill dropped him with a bullet through his knee, and the yell of the
  wounded man was excellent propaganda as a deterrent to imitators.</p>

  <p>"They'll try to starve us out, but I don't think they'll make any direct
  attack. Thank God, there's no night in these regions&mdash;I never dreamt I
  should be thankful for that!"</p>

  <p>The operator had left behind him on the table two large naval revolvers,
  and they made a welcome addition to the armament of the party. He handed one
  to Stone.</p>

  <p>"Take that and cover the left ladder; I'll look after the right," said
  Bill. "Shoot anybody you see&mdash;you cannot make a mistake."</p>

  <p>"Can I do anything?" asked Betty quietly. "I'm not afraid&mdash;look!" She
  put out her hand, and to Bill's amazement it did not tremble.</p>

  <p>"For the moment you had better keep out of range. This caboose is made of
  steel and ought to resist an ordinary rifle bullet. Our danger is from the
  rear, where we cannot see an attack coming."</p>

  <p>The real danger, he discovered, was from the roof, for presently they
  heard a patter of feet overhead and the blow of an axe clanging against the
  iron roof.</p>

  <p>"It would require the skill of Mr. Toby Marsh to make an entrance that
  way," said Bill coolly.</p>

  <p>It was queer that he should think of Toby Marsh at that moment, yet
  several times that day the man had come to his mind. Was he, with Laffin, the
  mysterious force which directed the blow of Harvey Hale's knife? For this was
  clear, that the big man was acting under orders, and somehow he could not
  think of Laffin as leader.</p>

  <p>The blows on the roof ceased, the footsteps sounded no more; but presently
  they came again, dragging something heavy. Suddenly the nozzle of a hosepipe
  was thrust in through the broken window and paid out furiously. Before Bill
  could gather the pipe and fling it out of the window there was ample time for
  the cabin to have been flooded, but no water came, and he wondered if there
  had been a blunder somewhere.</p>

  <p>"The pipes are frozen." It was Stone who supplied the explanation.</p>

  <p>"They'll try smoke next," said Bill. "I can only pray that they haven't a
  Mills bomb on board."</p>

  <p>She shivered at his cold-bloodedness.</p>

  <p>"You said they had taken Clive? What will they do to him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. He is a prisoner in the chart-house," said Bill. "They will
  probably use him as either a lever or an ambassador."</p>

  <p>It was a shrewd guess. Some time later, after a long lull, the figure of
  Clive appeared at the top of the bridge steps. He was still handcuffed; the
  look of bewilderment which Bill had seen on his face had intensified, so that
  there was something almost comic in his embarrassment. Bill felt a little
  pang of pleasure, in spite of the seriousness of the situation, that his
  rival should appear at such a disadvantage and was instantlv ashamed of his
  meanness.</p>

  <p>"Don't come down. What do you want?" shouted Bill.</p>

  <p>From where he stood he could see not only the bridge, but had a good view
  beneath the bridge, across to the bow of the anchored <i>Escorial</i>, which
  was swinging idly in the tide.</p>

  <p>"I have a message for you," shouted Clive, with a dismal attempt at
  cheerfulness. "Don't plug me&mdash;I'm doing my best!"</p>

  <p>"Tell the others to keep back," warned Bill, and watched his lordship
  descend the ladder with painful slowness.</p>

  <p>Presently he stood under the broken window.</p>

  <p>"They say that if you'll surrender, there'll be no further trouble. Hale
  has killed the doctor&mdash;you know that? Now he talks about going back,
  turning State's evidence, and handing the ship over to the New York police
  authorities."</p>

  <p>"Loud cheers," said Bill sarcastically. "Do you believe that?"</p>

  <p>"I'm blest if I know what to think, Holbrook," said Clive. "They
  threatened to hang me at the yardarm or some other beastly place, unless I
  can induce you to do as they wish! They say you can go back to your cabin and
  that no further attempt will be made on you. Naturally they're anxious about
  their own skins."</p>

  <p>"I'll not do it!"</p>

  <p>Lowbridge looked round fearfully.</p>

  <p>"I'd ask you to let me in, only I'm afraid these devils would shoot me.
  They've got me covered. Honestly, I believe Hale is scared sick."</p>

  <p>"In which case he can get up his anchor and steam south," said Bill. "We
  can travel just as comfortably in this caboose as we can in the luxury of
  suite H." Then, with a gasp: "Who told you who I was?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"They know. Personally, I shouldn't have recognised you. Gosh! if I ever
  get out of this I'll never come to sea again, even if I have to settle down
  in America! What shall I tell them?" he asked after a pause.</p>

  <p>"What I said. If he turns the ship south, we go south too, whether we're
  here or in suite H. I don't trust him, and you'll be a fool if you do. Why
  does he threaten to hang you if he's square?"</p>

  <p>"Because apparently he wants your good word. He seems to have an
  inordinate faith in the power of the press"</p>

  <p>Bill's derisive laughter interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"Am I a child?" he said. "I'm sorry if you're running any risks&mdash;I
  don't think you are, Lowbridge, because he'll not put his threat into
  execution. But you must tell him that I'm staying here till we reach
  somewhere in the region of 45 degrees north. He has enough oil to strike the
  track of steamers."</p>

  <p>The disconsolated Clive returned to the bridge.</p>

  <p>"What will they do now? You don't think Clive is in any danger?" asked
  Stone anxiously.</p>

  <p>"If they're serious about hanging him I may change my mind, but for the
  moment we stay here."</p>

  <p>The vessel was still swinging. A big iceberg which had been in view
  through the port window had disappeared, and a newer and smaller berg was
  slowly coming into sight as the great vessel leisurely circled her anchor.
  Suddenly Bill, who had been watching the bridge, dropped to the floor, seized
  a pair of binoculars that he had seen on a shelf, and leapt up to the table
  again.</p>

  <p>Far away on that sector of the horizon which was now in view, were three
  blurs of smoke, and through the powerful glasses he distinguished them. He
  did not know the <i>Kent</i> from the <i>Sussex</i>, but the third vessel
  with a lattice mast was a United States warship, or he had never seen
  one!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch58"
     name="ch58"></a>LVIII. &mdash; TOWARD THE FOG</h2>

  <p class="first">"WHAT is it?" asked Stone.</p>

  <p>For answer, Bill beckoned him to the table and handed him the glasses.</p>

  <p>Somebody else had seen the ship. He heard Hale roar an order, and in a few
  minutes a rattle and quiver as the anchor of the <i>Escorial</i> was dragged
  from its bed. The telegraphs were clanging, and presently came the purr of
  the turbines as the <i>Escorial</i> went slowly astern.</p>

  <p>There were signs of activity also on the <i>Thomas Inland.</i> She had not
  been anchored, but was lashed fast to the side of her big companion. As the
  vessels drew away from one another, the <i>Thomas Inland</i> turned slowly
  westward, and, with a bubble of foam above her propeller, began to push a
  bigger distance between herself and the great liner.</p>

  <p>A stentorian voice hailed her from the bridge.</p>

  <p>"Keep close company, Hackett! I may want to oil."</p>

  <p>Incautiously Hale showed himself for a second at the head of the ladder.
  Bill fired, saw the man stagger for a moment, and thought he was hit. He
  turned a face grinning with rage to the caboose, shook his fist and dived
  suddenly out of sight.</p>

  <p>Nearly half-an-hour passed before the <i>Escorial</i> got under way. Bill
  was looking at the warships in an agony of apprehension. They did not seem to
  be moving, and yet he knew they were nearer than when he had first sighted
  them.</p>

  <p>As the <i>Escorial</i> turned, they came into view through the port
  window, and from the centre ship, which was in fact the <i>Kent</i>, a puff
  of white smoke crawled lazily. With startling distinctness in that silent
  Arctic sea came the boom of her gun. Something struck the water between the
  <i>Thomas Inland</i> and the <i>Escorial</i>, and sent up a great geyser of
  spray.</p>

  <p>"No, they're not firing at us," said Bill, in answer to the girl's
  whispered question. "They're ranging, and maybe their idea is to scare Hale
  into surrender."</p>

  <p>Gathering speed, the <i>Escorial</i> pounded on, until ahead of them Bill
  saw what he thought was land, but which proved to be a mass of hummocky ice,
  backed by an irregular formation of isolated bergs.</p>

  <p>"He'll not dare drive through that," thought Bill, and the next minute he
  saw the <i>Thomas Inland</i>, which was leading, turn to port.</p>

  <p>They were moving towards the warship; Bill wondered why, but now saw that
  northward there had appeared an almost impenetrable barrier of ice.</p>

  <p>"Wireless cabin ahoy!" It was Hale's megaphone roar. "Send a message to
  those warships that if they attempt to board the <i>Escorial</i> I will blow
  up the ship!"</p>

  <p>Bill had almost forgotten the function of the cabin, but this reminded
  him. Leaving the girl in his place, at her urgent request, he began to feel
  out in the ether for the ships of war, and presently he caught the signals of
  the American.</p>

  <p>"The captain says that if you approach too closely he will blow up the
  ship."</p>

  <p>"Who is that speaking?" came the answer, and Bill gave particulars about
  himself and his party. "Is the ship ahead of you the <i>Thomas Inland</i>?"
  was the next question, and he replied in the affirmative.</p>

  <p>"Am signalling tanker that if she does not stop shall destroy her," said
  the American.</p>

  <p>Bill, before all things, was a patriot.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake don't!" he rapped the message furiously. "She is
  carrying interest on America's loan to Europe!"</p>

  <p>The captain of the American, excellent patriot as he was, had evidently a
  soul above money. Again that lazy cloud of smoke from the warship's side, a
  droning whine that rose to a shriek, and the bridge of the tanker burst into
  sudden flame, and, when the smoke had cleared away, the ship was out of
  control, broadside on, and only Harvey Hale's supreme seamanship averted a
  collision.</p>

  <p>Bill rattled the transmitter key surely.</p>

  <p>"Tanker hit amidships. Bridge carried away. There may be fire on board.
  She is out of control."</p>

  <p>He received a "thank you" from the three warships almost simultaneously.
  And now one, which proved to be the <i>Sussex</i>, was moving ahead of her
  companions, smote bellowing from her stacks.</p>

  <p>"She's under forced draught," said Stone, and dodged just in time.</p>

  <p>A bullet ripped through the window and splattered against the iron casing.
  Bill snatched up his pistol and jumped on to the table, but the sniper was
  not visible, and had probably taken advantage of Stone's preoccupation.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer the warship approached, and, examining her through his
  glasses, Bill saw that there was no vestige of human life on her decks. She
  was cleared for action, four long guns swung menacingly towards the
  liner.</p>

  <p>Beneath them the deck of the <i>Escorial</i> quivered and trembled. She,
  too, was working up to her top speed, and the water curved in two high waves
  from her bows. The ticker was chattering furiously. Bill took up the receiver
  and listened.</p>

  <p>"Is there any danger that captain of the <i>Escorial</i> will carry out
  threat to sink vessel?"</p>

  <p>Bill thought for a moment, and tapped "Yes."</p>

  <p>"What fuel has she on board?"</p>

  <p>"Very little."</p>

  <p>A long silence, and then the <i>Sussex</i> spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Will keep you close order. If necessary shall hole <i>Escorial</i>
  forrard," was the cold-blooded suggestion.</p>

  <p>"And they'll enjoy doing it!" groaned Bill.</p>

  <p>The <i>Sussex</i> was running on a parallel course, edging closer and
  closer to the liner. Again the <i>Sussex</i> became inquisitive.</p>

  <p>"May I blow away bridge?"</p>

  <p>Bill did not wait for the message to finish before he tapped an emphatic
  "No." The bridge was dangerously near to the wireless cabin, and to him there
  was only one passenger on the <i>Escorial</i>, and that was Betty.</p>

  <p>"Lord Lowbridge prisoner in chart-house," he added, glad to find an
  excuse.</p>

  <p>There was a blur of grey on the horizon ahead&mdash;fog! Harvey Hale had
  seen that patch and was racing towards it with his heart in his mouth. They
  had long since left the <i>Thomas Inland</i> astern, and, looking back, he
  could see she was being boarded.</p>

  <p>"Keep her nose to that fog. Maybe it will be twenty miles thick and we'll
  dodge these brass-bound&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Whatever plans he had made were subjected to a slight alteration. He heard
  Bill's voice yelling from the radio house.</p>

  <p>"The captain of the <i>Sussex</i> orders you to take a southerly course.
  If you enter the fog-bank he will 'close' you."</p>

  <p>Harvey Hale looked round at the warship. Despite his own speed, she was
  keeping level with him, probably going a little faster, but he had to
  economise fuel. He could not hope to reach the fog before the "closing"
  occurred, which meant that she would be steaming within a dozen yards of him,
  and the one danger he feared at that moment was the advent of a boarding
  party.</p>

  <p>Nor was the <i>Sussex</i> the only danger; the American war vessel was
  also running under forced draught and was overhauling him on his starboard
  side. Sandwiched between those two grey devils of the sea, there was no hope
  of escape. If the Yankee "closed" there would be ungentle work.</p>

  <p>He made another calculation; the fog was five miles ahead, but less
  distant on his starboard side, for he had unconsciously dipped into a bay, or
  else the fog had formed whilst he was on the run.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the <i>Escorial</i> heeled over, and, turning sharp to port, ran
  across the bows of the American vessel, which was now so near that, to avoid
  the risk of a collision, her captain had to turn hard to port, incidentally
  masking, in the most effective manner, both the objective and the guns of the
  <i>Sussex.</i> Before the ship could straighten out, the <i>Escorial</i> had
  gained a mile. The fog had come out to meet them, a thin, tenuous mist, that
  thickened with every yard they travelled, until the bridge was no longer
  visible.</p>

  <p>"This is where trouble is coming," said Bill.</p>

  <p>It came in an unexpected fashion. He was in the midst of receiving a
  message from the warships when the instrument went dead.</p>

  <p>"They've sent a man up the mast to cut the aerial. I wonder they hadn't
  thought of it before," said Bill.</p>

  <p>It had been cold before, but now it became intense, and this sudden drop
  in the thermometer was a serious matter. The fog and the fall in temperature
  could only mean the proximity of an iceberg of unusual size; and when he
  heard the engine bell clang he knew that Harvey Hale had also recognised the
  danger, and was slowing down. What direction they were taking it was
  impossible to discover.</p>

  <p>Nothing was more certain than that the big man would try to double back on
  his pursuers. He had gauged the depth of the fog, and must know that there
  was less danger on the northward track than to the south or west, for he had
  seen the open sea where the fog now was.</p>

  <p>For the moment Holbrook was most concerned with the danger to his own
  little party. Harvey Hale would take full advantage of the fog-bank, and he
  was not left long in doubt as to this. The crash of a battering-ram on the
  door told him that the end was very near. The second blow gave the attackers
  their entry. Bill shot down the first and second men, but before he could
  fire again, he was borne down by the rush of unsavoury bodies, and fell,
  struggling, on the floor of the cabin.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch59"
     name="ch59"></a>LIX. &mdash; THE SIREN</h2>

  <p class="first">"DON'T hurt the girl!" Harvey's voice came from the deck
  outside. "Hurry it, you awkward swabs!"</p>

  <p>"Got him, Captain!" gasped somebody, and Bill, bleeding and bruised, was
  hauled out on to the deck.</p>

  <p>One of Hale's ears was covered with a dressing. Bill's shot had not gone
  so wide as he had feared.</p>

  <p>"Take him up to the chart-house, where I can see him," stormed Hale. "You
  Yankee swine, I'll teach you to play monkey tricks with me! Up with him!"</p>

  <p>Bill was dragged up to the bridge and flung into the empty
  chart-house.</p>

  <p>"Tie his hands," said Hale. "And, young lady, if you give me any trouble,
  you'll be sorry sooner than you expect. You'll be sorry enough, anyway," he
  grinned, and leered into her face. "You're one of the best pieces I've seen
  for a long time, and old Harvey ain't so old that he can't appreciate a
  pretty wench when he sees one!"</p>

  <p>Where was Clive? Almost as if Bill had spoken his thoughts aloud, Hale
  answered him.</p>

  <p>"There's your pal," he said, and pointed to the inner room, where the
  captain had had his quarters.</p>

  <p>He dragged open the door and they had a momentary vision of Clive
  Lowbridge, lying on a bed, trussed from head to foot, and his face distorted
  with anger. Another second and the door was closed.</p>

  <p>"You people are going to be useful to me&mdash;all of you," chuckled
  Harvey, and, pouring out half a glass of raw whisky, drank it down with
  gusto. "If you've got any idea that them naval men are going to help you, get
  it out of your nuts! There ain't anything in heaven or hell that can pull you
  through <i>this</i> trouble, believe me!"</p>

  <p>Soon after he swaggered out on the deck to consult the watch, and when he
  came back he was accompanied by three men, who carried bulging pillow-cases,
  which they emptied on the table. Bill looked in amazement. There were ropes
  of pearls, diamonds, brooches, magnificent wristlets, and mixed with these,
  bundle upon bundle of American currency, thick wads of French francs, and a
  miscellaneous collection of gold.</p>

  <p>"I guess we've lost the money that was on the <i>Thomas Inland</i>," he
  said, "but there's lashings on this ship to keep us all in luxury."</p>

  <p>He opened the captain's safe and thrust in the jewellery. The money he
  stuffed away in one of the pillow-slips.</p>

  <p>"And I can tell you this," he said, addressing Bill, "that there is
  another half a million that we got out of the post, and, what's more, only
  three-quarters of the Treasury money went on board the <i>Inland</i>. There's
  enough left to make this worth while when we scupper you, and leave you for
  these Navy men to pick up."</p>

  <p>There came at this second a dramatic interruption. An oil-covered man
  dashed into the cabin, his face streaked blackly.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Snell?" asked Hale sharply.</p>

  <p>"Captain, the juice has gone"</p>

  <p>Hale clapped his hand over the engineer's mouth and thrust him outside,
  pulling the door close behind him.</p>

  <p>"They're running short of oil," said Stone in an exultant whisper. "That
  means that he'll be forced to stop!"</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head.</p>

  <p>"They have I don't know how many hundreds of tons in the cargo," he said.
  "The purser told me yesterday. He wondered who was shipping heavy oil to the
  United States, and suggested it was a lunatic. It is only a question of hours
  before they'll tap enough to carry them clear of pursuit."</p>

  <p>"But where can they go now?" asked the girl. "Didn't you tell me that the
  little ship was intended as a sort of lifeboat for them?"</p>

  <p>Bill was silent. This fact had not occurred to him. The capture of the
  <i>Thomas Inland</i> changed the situation, and Hale's plans must undergo a
  radical transformation. He could no longer abandon the ship in the Arctic
  Sea; he must make some port, and make it under the escort of warships. His
  alternative was to reach some inhabited coastline and take to the boats in
  the night, trusting to reach land with his loot. Thinking the matter over,
  Bill decided this was the course that Hale would take, and that the signal
  for his leaving the ship would also be the signal for the destruction of the
  superfluous members of his party.</p>

  <p>The fog was thinning, but the vessel still went dead slow. An hour later,
  they emerged into a sea which to Harvey Hale's mind, was beautifully free
  from warships. The <i>Escorial</i> was now moving north-west. Hale believed
  that it was possible that, by circumnavigating the fog-bank, he could shake
  off his pursuers and lead them along enough to make the Canadian coast. His
  main plan was to fall in with some small trading vessel, and, on the excuse
  that he needed assistance, to board the smaller ship, take possession, and
  leaving the <i>Escorial</i> to its fate, make his getaway. That he
  contemplated without a qualm the destruction of three thousand lives was an
  incredible fact. The rope had been spun that would hang him; he had no
  illusions as to the outcome of the adventure if he faced an Old Bailey jury.
  No excuse he could offer, no proof that he acted under the instructions of
  others, would rescue him from that quick trap in Pentonville Prison where
  pirates are hanged, since Execution Dock is no longer a fashionable place for
  the dispatch of seafaring miscreants.</p>

  <p>For the time being he grasped at the straw of deliverance which his luck
  offered to him. With Stone and the reporter as hostages, he might yet avoid a
  conflict which could not fail to end unhappily for himself. Wholesale death
  bulked very small by the side of his own imminent peril.</p>

  <p>When Hale returned to his prisoners he was in high spirits, inclined even
  to take a good-humoured view of Bill's bad shooting. And, as usual, his
  elation was expressed in a very favourable view of his own extraordinary
  qualities.</p>

  <p>"There isn't another man in the world," he boasted, "who could have
  slipped that crowd of sleuths. Did you see what I did, Holbrook? Turned
  ninety degrees across their path? And mind you, even if that skipper hadn't
  had the sense to pull up, I'd have got away with it. Yes, sir, you could
  search the world for Harvey Hale's opposite number, and you'd have to admit
  that he doesn't live!"</p>

  <p>He pinched Bill's neck suggestively.</p>

  <p>"That's a good throat for cutting, young fellow. By God, it's going to be
  cut, unless you're lucky!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he broke into a fit of laughter.</p>

  <p>"All you boys and girls ought to be together," he said mockingly, and,
  unlocking the door of the captain's suite, he invited them into the room
  where Clive Lowbridge lay, inert and helpless.</p>

  <p>"Good looking fellow, ain't he? I'll tell the world he is! Member of the
  aristocracy, too!" he gibed. "You can sit here and keep him company, but I'll
  cut the throat of anybody who attempts to unlash him! Maybe I won't be so
  rough with you"&mdash;he was ogling Betty&mdash;"because you're going to be
  my sweetie!"</p>

  <p>He went out through the chart-house, laughing as at a good joke. Harvey
  Hale had found a new interest in life. Betty crossed to the bed and laid her
  cool hand on the prisoner's forehead.</p>

  <p>"Are you very badly hurt, Clive?" she asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm uncomfortable, and I doubt if it would be wise to loosen
  me&mdash;yet. Have you a knife, Holbrook?"</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head, and exposed his manacled hands.</p>

  <p>"He treated me very decently at first, until after he had murdered poor
  Laffin," Clive went on. "It was when I protested against that awful crime
  that he had me tied up and put in here. I suppose he's shaken off the
  warships?"</p>

  <p>"For the time being," said Bill, by nature an optimist.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it matters very much whether he has shaken them off or
  not," said Clive. "This devil will not think twice about blowing up the ship.
  He says he will burn it to the water's edge, and I believe he will."</p>

  <p>Bill was examining his bonds.</p>

  <p>"I could loose them for you," he said.</p>

  <p>Clive hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I don't wish you to take any additional risks, but I'd hate to stop you
  doing it!"</p>

  <p>Bill had an unusual knowledge of knots and hitches, and at the end of ten
  minutes' work he had left Clive's bonds to all appearance very much as they
  were when he had started on them, but with a difference.</p>

  <p>"You can practically shake yourself free when you feel like it," he
  said.</p>

  <p>He left Stone talking to the prisoner, and walked across to where Betty
  was sitting.</p>

  <p>"Are you dreadfully frightened?" he asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not very frightened. Billy, I have a plan&mdash;I wonder if I
  could get on to the bridge?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked, and then his eyes fell on her bag, which was still in her
  hand, and Bill uttered an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Didn't they take it away from you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No. Will you have it? I don't think I could possibly use it."</p>

  <p>She opened the bag and put the little Browning into his hand. Bill was
  still wearing his steward's uniform, though he had stripped the moustache
  from his lip at the first opportunity. He thrust the pistol between his shirt
  and trousers, and covered the hilt with the bottom of his brass-buttoned
  waistcoat. His own bonds were not easily got rid of. The handcuffs were too
  small to allow him to slip his hands free, but there was sufficient play to
  make the Browning a very practical assistant if the worst came to the
  worst.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a bit frightened, only I am surprised at myself," she went on.
  "Somehow, this blustering, murdering bully of a man isn't half as terrifying
  as the doctor. Billy, I can't be sorry he's dead. I know it's unnatural and
  unwomanly, but he was the real shadow over my life, and all others seem so
  insignificant by comparison."</p>

  <p>Turning her head, she saw Clive's eyes fixed upon hers.</p>

  <p>"What are you conspirators discussing?" he asked, and, without waiting to
  hear her reply: "I hope they haven't hurt poor old Benson. There's a good
  servant lost to somebody. Yet if he knew I was going to be executed by these
  brutes, he would have no other thought than as to the most suitable costume
  for the occasion!"</p>

  <p>They had run into the fog again; the speed of the ship had been reduced,
  and through the portholes that looked out on to the bridge, Bill could see
  the whiteness swirling over the ship's side.</p>

  <p>"Hale won't like this," he said. "There's a chance that he'll blunder into
  the warships."</p>

  <p>Apparently the captain was not greatly concerned, for he appeared soon
  after.</p>

  <p>"Come out and see the pretty fog, young lady," he mocked. "You and me have
  got to get acquainted!"</p>

  <p>He took her arm in his and led her through a doorway. Bill, following her,
  saw that she went willingly, and remembered that she had expressed a wish to
  go to the bridge. Looking over his shoulder, Hale saw him.</p>

  <p>"I don't want you!" he bellowed.</p>

  <p>"I'm interested in the pretty fog, too," said Bill coolly. For a moment
  the man drew back as though he were going to strike him, but evidently Hale
  detected some humour in his remark, and, without another word, he toot the
  girl's arm again and they walked out on to the broad bridge.</p>

  <p>"What is that, Captain Hale?" Her voice was surprisingly sweet and gentle.
  She pointed to one of the brass telegraphs, and he explained its
  function.</p>

  <p>"And that is the compass?"</p>

  <p>Bill could only listen, aghast, to the change in her tone. "That is the
  compass, young lady, by which we'll get away from the boys in blue."</p>

  <p>"And what is that?" She pointed to a loosely hanging line.</p>

  <p>"That's the siren&mdash;we call that a fog-horn. And"</p>

  <p>Suddenly she thrust him back and, leaping up, caught the line and held on
  to it. A terrific, thundering shriek of sound broke the stillness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch60"
     name="ch60"></a>LX. &mdash; THE MAN IN CONTROL</h2>

  <p class="first">WITH a roar of rage, Hale sprang at her and tried to wrench
  her loose, but she clung desperately, and the thunder of the siren drowned
  all sound until he pried her fingers away.</p>

  <p>"You little devil!" he hissed, his face white with fear.</p>

  <p>Bill's hand closed on the butt of his pistol. If that raised fist had half
  descended, Hale would have been a dead man. Instead, he flung her back
  against the reporter.</p>

  <p>"Go inside," he said, "and pray to your God that they do not find us! If
  they do, it will be hell for yours!"</p>

  <p>"I did it, I did it!" she gasped, as Bill led her back, trembling with
  excitement, to the inner cabin. "I made up my mind to do it. As soon as I
  came on to the bridge I saw the rope, and I guessed that it was the foghorn.
  Oh, Billy, they must have heard us if they're anywhere near."</p>

  <p><i>Zoo-oom!</i></p>

  <p>The faint sound of a distant siren came to them, and Bill held his
  breath.</p>

  <p><i>Zoo-oom!</i></p>

  <p>From another direction, and nearer. The warships were also in the fog.</p>

  <p>Hale came stamping in, livid with rage, inarticulate. He could only shake
  his fist at the calm girl and bubble hideous threats which she could not
  hear, even less understand. The ship was going full speed again. He was
  careless of bergs or of any other danger. The big man was forcing the liner
  through the fog-belt. They passed within a stone's throw of a huge white
  cliff of ice, so close that Bill could have tossed a ball amidst its
  fairy-like finials. Faster and faster, hour after hour, whilst the fog held,
  and the lookout at the bow bellowed warnings: "Ice on the left. Ice on the
  starboard bow." The mighty vessel, like a giant snake, slipped and slid
  amidst cold death. And then again the fog melted to the thinnest of mists and
  vanished altogether.</p>

  <p>"Out of it!" roared Hale exultantly. "Slipped 'em! Harvey Hale did
  it!"</p>

  <p>To the right of him was fog again. Into that he would penetrate and lie
  snug. The fog was a horizon away, but easy going for the <i>Escorial.</i> He
  calculated he had left his pursuers ten miles in the rear. They were
  commanded by naval officers, fearful of injuring their ships and the
  court-martial that would follow. They would crawl and creep from berg to
  berg, the quartermasters in the chains swinging their lead continuously. They
  would not take the risks taken by Harvey Hale, the finest seaman of all the
  world, who handled a fifty-thousand ton liner with the ease that another man
  might handle a motor-boat, and had sent her at top speed through ice and fog,
  with her three thousand passengers and hands quivering in dread below.</p>

  <p>"Harvey Hale did it!" He roared the words.</p>

  <p>He had done something that future generations of seamen would talk about;
  his great face went purple at the inward contemplation of his
  achievement.</p>

  <p>And then a voice of terror shouted his name, and he looked back. Three war
  vessels abreast were coming out of the fog, and steaming at full speed!</p>

  <p>"We've got to run for it," said Hale. The hand on the telegraph trembled
  slightly. "Don't turn her!" he yelled, as the helmsman brought the ship over
  to port. "Give them our stern, damn you! You saw what they did to the
  <i>Inland</i>&mdash;blew her bridge up! Let 'em blow the ship endways.
  There's safety there." He pointed to the fog ahead, but it was thin. He saw
  that long before he reached the first out-liers of mist, and, deep as he
  could penetrate, he could, looking back, see the smoke of the pursuing
  warships. To double now was impossible; he must keep straight on. "How's her
  head?"</p>

  <p>"Due south, Captain," said the individual at the wheel.</p>

  <p>He nodded. If he could only reach the night! This cursed, never-ending
  daylight, that showed a ship as plainly at midnight as it did at midday! If
  he could only reach night! But night lay twenty-four hours sailing south of
  the line he traversed. In half that time he might find a few hours of
  darkness, and, steaming without lights, evade his enemy, but half a day was
  twelve hours.</p>

  <p>Bill was right when he said that the man had a supply of fuel on
  board&mdash;not enough to carry out his new plan, which was to sail from pole
  to pole and seek the seclusion of the eternal night in the Antarctic&mdash;a
  bold scheme, worthy of a Harvey Hale. If that old fool Laffin had only
  thought of that! It would have been so simple. The trade routes of the South
  Atlantic are few and sparsely used. Clear of a point west of the Cape of Good
  Hope and he could strike the southern night that would give him three months'
  security. That idea was impossible now; he must make for the coast of Canada,
  and chance finding a ship that would take him and his party to safety.</p>

  <p>He looked back again; the ships were now at his heels, and were spreading,
  this time the <i>Kent</i> to his right and the American to his left. They
  would call his bluff and close him. He sent for the drunken mate who had
  sailed with him before and who was now his chief assistant.</p>

  <p>"Stand by to flood ship," he said.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" The mate frowned. "What do you mean, Harvey, 'flood ship?' You're
  not going to sink us, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Do as I tell you!" snarled Hale. "Is that aerial repaired?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Send a message to the skipper of the Yankee. 'If you come any nearer I
  will flood ship.'"</p>

  <p>"You can send any message you like," said the mate gruffly, "but you're
  not going to flood this damned ship! I'm not a ringleader in this hold-up,
  the most I'll get is five years, and you can bet"</p>

  <p>So far he got when Hale struck him down, and, lifting the the dazed figure
  from the deck, dashed him against the chart-house.</p>

  <p>"You swine!" he hissed. "Will you do as I tell you? He raised a fist
  threateningly.</p>

  <p>"All right," muttered the bruised and bleeding man and slunk away.</p>

  <p>Hale looked back at the <i>Kent</i>. From her mainmast floated a small
  Union Jack, an ominous sign. It was her battle-flag, flown only by a British
  cruiser when she is entering action. She was creeping up to him on his port.
  He roared down to the radio house.</p>

  <p>"Tell them we've got that girl Stone in the chart-house!" he shouted.</p>

  <p><i>Bang!</i></p>

  <p>He did not see the splash of the shot, but felt the vessel quiver and yaw
  involuntarily.</p>

  <p><i>Bang!</i></p>

  <p>The second gun was from the American, who was nearer, and this time the
  <i>Escorial</i> staggered.</p>

  <p>"Turn a few points starboard," cried Hale hoarsely.</p>

  <p>The quartermaster spun the wheel, but the ship did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Rudder's gone, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>The <i>Escorial</i> was yawing from left to right, and now, taking a
  definite course, circled to port, as though it were involuntarily trying to
  emulate the earlier manoeuvre of its captain. The rudder gone! Hale's jaw
  dropped. He flung open the door of the chart-house and strode in.</p>

  <p>"You people are within three minutes of hell," he said briefly. "Get down
  below, all of you boys."</p>

  <p>He bundled them out one by one, and Bill waited.</p>

  <p>"You'll stay here," said Hale, pointing his grimy finger at the girl.
  "Here you'll stay, my beauty. And you too," he looked down at Clive. "There's
  plenty of time yet. We're going round in a circle and we'll continue going
  round in a circle. They've shot away our rudder, but they can't get any
  nearer. If they think I'm going to ring the engines astern, they're going to
  have another guess coming! Get!"</p>

  <p>"I'm staying here," said Bill calmly.</p>

  <p>With a scream of anger the man's fury broke forth. As he leapt, Bill fired
  once, but the fury of the attack was such that he was thrown off his balance
  before he could pull the trigger for the second time. In another instant he
  was on the floor, with the man's knee on his chest and the huge hands about
  his throat. He struggled desperately, and might have been killed, had not the
  girl come to his assistance.</p>

  <p>"Clive, Clive!" she screamed.</p>

  <p>Clive rose to his feet and pulled at his bonds. As he reached the pistol
  that had fallen from Bill's hands, Hale turned and saw him, and, with a
  squeal of fear, flew out of the room, slamming the door behind him.</p>

  <p>Bill, manacled as he was, was the first to follow. A man on the bridge
  tried to intercept him, but, dodging, he dashed down the ladder to the boat
  deck as Hale disappeared from view in the opening of the companionway. He
  caught sight of him leaping into the main entrance of the saloon. A shivering
  steward saw him and stared aghast.</p>

  <p>"Where did he go&mdash;the captain?" asked Bill breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Down to D. deck," said the man.</p>

  <p>Before he could frame a question, Bill had jumped to the next landing. He
  saw Hale dart into the Stones' suite and followed. The private sitting-room
  was empty. He tried the door of Stone's room. It opened and he rushed in.
  There was nobody there. Betty's room was locked. He rattled at the door.</p>

  <p>"Open, Hale! The game's up&mdash;open!"</p>

  <p>There was no reply. Putting his shoulder to the door, he tried to burst it
  in... then suddenly everything went black....</p>

  <p>When he recovered he was laying on the floor. He guessed he was in Betty's
  room, because he smelt the perfume that she used, but the portholes were
  heavily covered with curtains, and the room was in complete darkness. There
  was another scent, a pungent, familiar odour that he recognised without being
  able to define. He put his hand to his head; it was wet and sticky, the hair
  matted. When he tried to move, the pain was excruciating. Somebody had
  roughly bound his ankles together and the manacles were still on his
  wrists.</p>

  <p>He was not alone. Though he could hear and see nothing in the darkness,
  instinctively he knew that there was somebody in the room with him. He
  stretched out his hand and touched a coat. Somebody was lying in a similar
  plight&mdash;worse perhaps, for when he pressed against the shoulder of the
  man with his hands, he did not move.</p>

  <p>The ship was still under way, still, he guessed, moving in circles. And
  yet, from time to time he could have sworn he heard the boom of distant guns.
  Perhaps it was only his imagination.</p>

  <p>He must have swooned with weakness and pain, but when he again recovered
  consciousness, his first thought was of the ship. The thud of the turbines
  came to his ears.</p>

  <p>"Still moving," he said drowsily, and then he heard the door open and
  looked up.</p>

  <p>The intruder had taken the precaution of masking all the portlights of the
  cabin and Holbrook saw nothing, but he knew, by the current of air that came
  to his face, that the door had opened.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" he called. "I am Holbrook."</p>

  <p>There was no answer. He heard quiet breathing, and presently a hand
  touched his arm, travelled up till it came to his shoulder, and then to his
  face. A thrill of horror turned him cold, and he struggled to throw himself
  clear, but the hand gripped him. Then he heard a faint click, the sound of a
  clasp-knife being opened, and shouted, striking at the arm of his unknown
  assailant with a handcuff. But in the position he was held, his blows had no
  force and were guarded by the forearm and the elbow of the assassin. He heard
  the quick intake of breath, and guessing that the knife was raised to strike,
  utilised all his strength to twist out of the grip.</p>

  <p>"Anybody there?"</p>

  <p>It was a voice outside.</p>

  <p>"Help!" yelled Holbrook.</p>

  <p>He heard a queer sound, and the hand dropped away from his throat.</p>

  <p>"Be careful, he's got a knife!" shouted Bill.</p>

  <p>"I want you!" It was Bullott's voice, stem with authority. Bill heard the
  sound of a scuffle, a thump of a body against the panelling of the cabin and
  the slam of a door.</p>

  <p>"Bullott, Bullott," he called.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, son, where are you?"</p>

  <p>"Here."</p>

  <p>The detective came into the cabin, and, stooping, pulled the
  half-conscious reporter to his feet.</p>

  <p>"There's somebody else here."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Bullott's voice. "At least, I guessed. Here's a
  settee&mdash;sit down."</p>

  <p>He pulled aside the heavy curtains, letting in the grey light to the
  cabin, and entered Betty's state-room. Bill heard the curtain rings drawn
  aside, and presently Bullott came out, shutting the door carefully behind
  him.</p>

  <p>"We're still moving?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, we're steering by the propellers. The warships are standing by, they
  think we've nearly reached the end of our oil, but they're wrong. Did you
  send them a radio that we were running short?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;where is Miss Stone?"</p>

  <p>"She's all right." There was something in the tone that sent a shiver down
  Bill's spine.</p>

  <p>"Where is she?" he asked. "Is she in any harm?"</p>

  <p>"She's in some danger, not very serious."</p>

  <p>"And Stone?"</p>

  <p>"They're together," was the reassuring reply. "My young friend, you've had
  a narrow escape."</p>

  <p>Bullott was guiding him along the alleyway to his own cabin. Bill's knees
  were curiously weak and as he walked he reeled from side to side as though
  the ship were in a heavy sea. When Bullott got him into the cabin:</p>

  <p>"I think I can take those handcuffs off for you. They're English pattern
  and I have a key somewhere."</p>

  <p>He was as good as his word, and they were not in the cabin a minute before
  Bill was free and rubbing his chafed wrists, whilst the detective bathed the
  wound.</p>

  <p>"Hale, then, is still in control of the ship?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," was the quiet reply. "Harvey Hale controls nothing just now. In
  fact, he's dead, just now, and if I had to mention&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dead!" said Bill in amazement.</p>

  <p>"He was the man lying dead in the cabin with you; didn't you know that? I
  thought you'd have guessed."</p>

  <p>"Then who is in control?"</p>

  <p>Inspector Bullott did not reply until he had carefully pinned the bandage
  he was putting about the reporter's head.</p>

  <p>"Tolerably thick nut, this of yours, my friend," he said. "You ought to
  have been dead. If I remember rightly, that is the second wound you have
  had."</p>

  <p>"Who is in control?" asked Bill again.'</p>

  <p>"The man in control of this ship at the moment," said the detective
  cheerfully, "is an old friend of yours, one Toby Marsh!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch61"
     name="ch61"></a>LXI. &mdash; BULLOTT MAKES AN ARREST</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL twisted his head up with an expression of pain. "Toby
  Marsh?" he said, not believing his ears.</p>

  <p>"That is the gentleman. Very few people are aware of the fact, but it is
  nevertheless true, that he is the top man in this ship at this identical
  moment."</p>

  <p>"But how&mdash;why?" asked Holbrook, his head swimming.</p>

  <p>"There are lots of hows, and a considerable number of whys, which I will
  explain to you a little later." He looked at Bill sharply. "I wonder if it is
  safe to take you up on the deck?"</p>

  <p>He slipped a long-barrelled pistol from his hip.</p>

  <p>"Put that in your pocket, and shoot anybody that doesn't look too
  friendly. I guess we'll risk it!"</p>

  <p>"But tell me, Bullott, what you mean by Toby Marsh being in control? Is he
  on board? Of course he is! That's a stupid question to ask, but I'm all in a
  maze. Is he with the gang?"</p>

  <p>The detective laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>"I should say he was!" he said. "Nobody knows as well as I how much on the
  inside of that gang Toby Marsh is!"</p>

  <p>"Have you seen him?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen him."</p>

  <p>"Have you spoken to him?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no, I haven't spoken to him," said Bullott, "but then, you see,
  there are very good reasons why I shouldn't. I got into a whole lot of
  trouble in London through consulting Toby and learnt my lesson."</p>

  <p>Bill was glad of the arm of his friend, for he was still dizzy and felt
  physically sick. The cold Arctic air revived him. They were alone on the
  promenade deck&mdash;the most daring of the passengers were those who at that
  moment were not at their prayers.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't advise you to go on the boat deck," said Bullott grimly. "In
  fact, you'll be wise if you stay near the entrance to the social hall, ready
  to jump. Somewhere in the bowels of this ship is a fire emergency control,"
  he went off at a tangent.</p>

  <p>Bill was looking aft. He could see no sign of the pursuing warships, and,
  guessing his thoughts, Bullott explained that they were only visible from the
  other side of the ship.</p>

  <p>"And a long way off, I can tell you, my friend," he said. "You see, this
  packet has more stamina than a battleship. They can, by running under forced
  draught, keep up with us for a time, but the farther we go, the bigger the
  distance between us."</p>

  <p>"What were you talking about&mdash;the fire emergency control?"</p>

  <p>"All these big ships are fitted with them. There is less danger from fire
  in oil-burning ships than in coal-burners, and an easier way of putting a
  fire under."</p>

  <p>Bill groaned.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're talking about. I want to know, is Miss Stone
  safe?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly safe, I think," said the detective.</p>

  <p>"How long can we go on like this?"</p>

  <p>"For another three days," was the surprising reply. "We've got that much
  oil."</p>

  <p>A man came flying along the deck and Bill recognised the acting engineer
  whom he had seen on the bridge earlier that day. He saw him fly up the ladder
  to the bridge, and even as he disappeared, the turbines thudded a little more
  slowly&mdash;slower&mdash;slower&mdash;and finally ceased.</p>

  <p>"We've stopped." said Bill.</p>

  <p>Bullott looked back in the sea and behaved insanely, for he chuckled and
  slapped his knee.</p>

  <p>"Cross to the other deck," he said, and led the way through the saloon
  opening.</p>

  <p>Now the warships were visible. They were coming up at top speed, and every
  minute brought them nearer. The <i>Escorial</i> was still under way and would
  continue under way for a quarter of an hour, such was the rate at which she
  had been travelling. But they were overtaking her at such a speed that, even
  as Bill watched, there came across the silent waters the faint clang of their
  telegraph. In ten minutes the warships were alongside, and up over the rails
  swarmed more sailors, British and American, than Bill had ever seen before.
  The first to reach the deck was a bronzed naval officer, revolver in
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Where's the skipper of this little ship?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Forrard, sir. I am Inspector Bullott, of Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>"Good! I had your lamp signal."</p>

  <p>He caught Bill's arm and hurried him after the officer.</p>

  <p>"But why did we stop?" whispered the reporter.</p>

  <p>"The juice went," was the laconic reply. "Remember that safety valve I
  told you about? Well, some guy turned it, and out into the ocean went three
  days' supply of excellent heavy oil."</p>

  <p>"Those are your men, sir," he broke off, as they reached the bridge
  deck.</p>

  <p>The tatterdemalion crowd that officered the ship made no resistance. Bill
  opened the door of the chart-house and went in. The inner door was locked,
  but two brawny naval ratings made short work of the barrier. The room was
  full of smoke&mdash;a bluish vapour curled up from a small oriental brazier
  placed on the floor in the middle of the room....</p>

  <p>Bill Holbrook staggered into the cabin to where, tied to a chair, lay
  Betty, unconscious. Stone lay, face downward, on a settee, and on the bed
  sprawled the figure of Clive.</p>

  <p>"Get them out into the air quick," said Bullott "I'm a fool&mdash;I ought
  to have known something like this would happen."</p>

  <p>The air in the room was unbreathable; the men choked as they carried the
  unconscious figures to the bridge. Bullott alone stayed behind to open the
  closed portholes and, lifting the brazier that burnt in the middle of the
  room carried it, holding his mouth and nose, to the bathroom and, flinging it
  into the bath, let the water run upon it. Only then did he fly to safety.</p>

  <p>"A close call," he said, "but if I am not mistaken in the dope, we are in
  time."</p>

  <p>The girl's eyelids fluttered, slowly they opened and she stared up into
  the strange faces of the naval officers who were overlooking her. Bullott
  walked to where the two men lay side by side, already showing signs of
  returning consciousness.</p>

  <p>"I want that man for murder," he said, pointing.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch62"
     name="ch62"></a>LXII . &mdash; BULLOTT'S STORY</h2>

  <p class="first">THEY dragged Clive Lowbridge to his feet, dazed and drunken
  with the drug. An ice-wet sponge applied to his face brought him at once to
  consciousness.</p>

  <p>"Your name is Clive George Lowbridge; you are the ninth Baron Lowbridge. I
  am taking you into custody on the charge of wilfully murdering your cousin,
  Cyril Francis Lowbridge, by administering poison."</p>

  <p>"I think you'll have some difficulty in proving that," said Lowbridge,
  pale as death.</p>

  <p>"Not so much as you would imagine. Sergeant Fanaby!"</p>

  <p>A man came forward and, seeing him, the face of Clive Lowbridge became
  distorted with rage. It was Benson!</p>

  <p>"You have been under suspicion since the death of your cousin, and under
  observation ever since you took this officer into your service," said
  Inspector Bullott. "He has all the information necessary to convict you, and
  I need hardly tell you that I am not relying only on that charge."</p>

  <p>Heavily ironed, Lowbridge was carried from the deck and transferred
  immediately to the British cruiser.</p>

  <p>"We have twelve hours to wait before the <i>Thomas Inland</i> comes up to
  us, and we can take in enough oil to reach New York," said Bullott, "and in
  the meantime, when it does arrive, the gentleman who spilt our own supply
  into the sea, and incidentally brought this ship to a halt, will not be found
  amongst the greasers."</p>

  <p>"You told me Toby Marsh was on board and in control of the ship?"</p>

  <p>Bullott nodded.</p>

  <p>"The man who knows where to find that safety valve, that could empty the
  oil tanks in ten minutes, may be said to be in control of any ship! He was so
  much in control that he stopped her!"</p>

  <p>"The whole credit for this discovery will naturally come to me. It should
  go to Toby Marsh," said Bullott, when they met that night in Stone's chilly
  cabin, for although they had sufficient oil to run the dynamos, there was not
  yet enough to give them heat. "It is perfectly true that Toby Marsh
  quarrelled with the doctor, over a fake burglary which the old man fixed, and
  which resulted in Toby being sent down to hard labour. And Toby, being
  naturally of a secretive and somewhat romantic disposition, has given up his
  spare time all these years to the discovery of the doctor's character. He
  knew he was a crook; he was anxious to know how much of a crook he was.</p>

  <p>"Clive Lowbridge was brought up by the doctor, and taught by him to
  worship money. Do you remember some copy-book maxims that we discovered
  wrapped round the clasp of Isis? Those had been torn haphazard from an
  exercise book in which Clive had written, from the dictation of his tutor,
  these sentiments, which, at any rate, actuated Dr. Laffin in his dealings
  with the world. There was no chance of Lowbridge succeeding to the title,
  until the doctor suggested the removal of the two men who stood in his way.
  They believed then that the late Lord Lowbridge was a very rich man; he had
  been left a million, but unfortunately he was something of a gambler. The
  doctor should have known this, for he had seen him at play, had watched him
  squander money at Monte Carlo, and thoroughly knew his weakness. Probably
  Laffin thought that he had so much money that there would still be enough
  left after his death. As you know, the death of Lord Lowbridge revealed the
  truth, which was that he was on the verge of bankruptcy when death removed
  him.</p>

  <p>"Then there was opened by accident a new prospect for the doctor. He was
  crossing Dartmoor one night, when he was held up by two of the Priors of the
  Sons of Ragusa, of whose existence he had never heard, though he was
  something of a mystic himself and dabbled in the occult. The news the Priors
  gave him was that their Head was ill, and he accompanied them to the Priory,
  where he found Mr. Leiff Stone, suffering from an attack of angina pectoris.
  In his delirium, or in a moment of confidence, poor Mr. Stone told him of a
  repeated vision he had had, that he had seen in a shop window a woman in a
  green dress with red hair, sitting before a desk on which was a green jade
  vase and one red rose. He must have then told Laffin that it had been
  revealed to him that this strange individual had a message for him. Laffin
  seized upon the idea and in this way worked round to make the greatest profit
  possible that came from his knowledge. The clasp of Isis, by-the-way, was
  given to him by Mr. Stone in payment of his services.</p>

  <p>"His first step was, through the Prior, to gain a high office in the
  Twenty-Third Degree; and here it seems that he had already formed in the
  rough the plan which if had carried out on the <i>Escorial</i>, namely, to
  seize a ship on its voyage. At any rate, he began to fill the Twenty-Third
  Degree with the scum of the seaport towns.</p>

  <p>"Remember this, that he had for Lowbridge a genuine affection. He told him
  everything, and Lowbridge knew, not only about his adventures at the Priory
  and the dream of Leiff Stone, but knew also that Laffin intended utilising
  the Twenty-Third Degree for his purpose Miss Carew&mdash;or as we know her,
  Miss Stone&mdash;was, with the approval of Lowbridge, chosen to act the part
  of the Messenger, Laffin's object being to obtain possession of the book
  which held all the secrets of the Order, the particulars of initiation
  services, passwords, but, more especially, the method by which the
  half-annual argosies were distributed. That he succeeded, we know. That
  night, after the book was in Laffin's possession, Mr. Stone was killed."</p>

  <p>Bill's hand tightened on the girl's, but she did not flinch.</p>

  <p>"The method I do not know. We shall probably discover that aconitine was
  the agent employed. Now there was one man in whom the Grand Prior reposed
  implicit confidence&mdash;that was Brother John Flanagan, and he was
  evidently worried over his friend's delusion about the woman in the green
  dress, for when he learnt from the Grand Prior that the messenger had been
  seen and the message received, he came to London to pursue his
  investigations. Lowbridge shadowed him, and shot him down in the street,
  because he thought that Miss Stone had told him much more than she really
  had. After the Grand Prior's death, Lowbridge took his place."</p>

  <p>"Not Laffin?" interrupted the astounded Holbrook.</p>

  <p>Bullott shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, the new Grand Prior was Lowbridge. The rest of that story you
  know. The unsuccessful attempt of these scoundrels to induce Mr. Pawter to
  make a fake draw was nearly followed by Clive Lowbridge's arrest. He escaped,
  however, with Laffin, his assistant, and was dropped by Laffin at
  Taunton.</p>

  <p>"Toby Marsh had followed Laffin to Bath, whence he took a car to
  Devonshire and missed him. He was out in morning early, watching the
  Bath-Bristol road, when he saw the doctor's car approaching, and with his
  customary impertinence, held it up. The doctor was furious; he would have
  made Harvey Hale, who was driving the machine, give our burglar friend a very
  unpleasant time, but Toby was well armed, and at last prevailed upon the
  doctor to let him travel with him to Bath, as he had something important to
  say.</p>

  <p>"Toby suspected Lowbridge. The discovery that Lowbridge was not in the car
  was something of a shock to him. His object in travelling at all was to trap
  the doctor into an admission that Lowbridge had just left him, and in this he
  succeeded, for, like most super-clever men, Laffin was childlike in some
  respects.</p>

  <p>"Toby already knew a great deal, having installed a microphone in Laffin's
  private room, and gradually there came into his possession an almost complete
  story of what was going to happen on the steamship <i>Escorial</i>. But he
  wasn't satisfied that he was right, and in his furtive way he decided upon
  securing a job in the engine-room of the ship. He told me about this
  later&mdash;in fact, a few days before I sailed he revealed as much of the
  story as he thought it was wise for me to know.</p>

  <p>"The point I would make is this, that the leader of the gang, the prime
  mover, the brain behind every new development, was Clive Lowbridge. He had
  doomed Laffin from the moment he learnt that the doctor had married his ward,
  and the fact that it was a mere act of precaution on the part of Laffin made
  no difference. It was humanly impossible that that vain, half-mad old man
  should ever come through this voyage alive.</p>

  <p>"Scotland Yard suspected Lowbridge, and at a very early stage had put one
  of their most capable officers in his service. The man called Benson, is, as
  you know, a detective, who will probably be promoted for the part he has
  played, before he reaches England.</p>

  <p>"After the book was secured, it became again necessary to remove Miss
  Stone. She had remembered her journey to Devonshire and the transference of
  the book to her, and that was fatal to their schemes. The mere possibility
  that she would tell the story to the detective filled them with apprehension,
  and they determined to remove her without delay. She called at Lowbridge's
  flat for tea. Lowbridge distracted her attention and put a very quickly
  acting dope into the cup and was observed by Benson, who changed the cups
  when his back was turned, with the result that it was Lowbridge who found
  himself under the influence of the drug.</p>

  <p>"I forget the circumstances now," said Bullott, "but I am under the
  impression that he sent Benson out to get some newspapers, believing that the
  action of the drug was so quick that the girl would be unconscious and
  smuggled away into his room before the servant returned, when he would find a
  further excuse for keeping him out of the way for the rest of the
  evening.</p>

  <p>"The greatest shock that Lowbridge had was to learn that a warrant had
  been issued for Laffin's arrest on a charge of murdering his uncle. Then,
  indeed, he knew that the game was nearly up, and that unless he silenced the
  doctor he could not escape arrest and the scaffold. Mr. Stone offered him the
  opportunity of going to America on the <i>Escorial</i>. I need hardly say
  that he would have been on the <i>Escorial</i> in any circumstances, for the
  gang had decided, after the narrow squeak which they had at the hands of
  Tinker Lane, that no time should be lost. They were, however, in some doubt
  as to when the British Treasury would ship the interest on the American debt,
  and this they learnt through La Florette, the dancer. Had it not been shipped
  by the <i>Escorial</i> you may be certain they would have found some reason
  for postponing, not only their own departure, but the departure of Mr. and
  Miss Stone.</p>

  <p>"I saw my chief at Scotland Yard, put as many facts before him as I knew,
  and received permission to sail on this ship, although he thought that in all
  probability a very credulous and inexperienced police officer had heard and
  believed a fairy story.</p>

  <p>"I don't think there is very much more to be told. Toby Marsh was on the
  ship. I saw him the first day, I spent forty-eight hot hours in his company,
  and when he Twenty-Third Degree showed their hand, he was a tower of strength
  not only to me but to the law. Toby rigged up a signal lamp aft, which kept
  us in touch with the warship after the wireless was in the hands of Lowbridge
  and his men."</p>

  <p>"Who killed Hale?"</p>

  <p>"Lowbridge. When Hale saw that the man he had double-crossed was free, he
  ran for his life. The taking prisoner of Lowbridge was camouflage to protect
  him if things went wrong. It was an excuse for his being on the bridge to
  direct operations at a critical moment, without appearing to be a member of
  the gang. But Hale, who was in fear of him, took advantage of his
  helplessness to secure him still further. The prisoner waited only long
  enough to give Hale a chance of settling with our young friend, then he
  chased both down to the cabin. It was he who struck down Holbrook.
  Afterwards, he decided that Holbrook alive was a danger and came down to
  finish him. His plan throughout had been in the event of failure, to end life
  pleasantly. The poison pastilles which were burning in the captain's cabin
  when we broke in, would ordinarily have killed everybody in the room in a few
  minutes&mdash;Lowbridge's luck was out to the last!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Eight days later, escorted by a fleet of small craft, the
  much-travelled U.S.S. <i>Escorial</i> came slowly into New York Harbour, and
  Betty Stone stood, a little overwhelmed by the most wonderful skyline in the
  world.</p>

  <p>Bullott had gone back to England on the <i>Kent</i>, and with him his
  chief witness, Toby Marsh. Bill had sworn many solemn oaths that he would
  follow by the first available mail steamer.</p>

  <p>"So this is America, Billy?" she said with a half-smile.</p>

  <p>"It is New York," said Bill, "which isn't exactly the same thing, though
  there are many who share your illusion. It is of it, but not it!"</p>

  <p>His arm was in hers as they leaned on the rail. Mr. Stone looked over his
  glasses at them for a moment and returned to a study of the early editions
  which had come out on the pilot boat.</p>

  <p>"You must show me the sights, Billy, before we go up to Mr. Stone's camp,
  and you must coach me in other things. What is the chief advantage of being
  an American citizen?"</p>

  <p>"There are so many I can't think of them," said Bill, "but the first that
  occurs to me is the facility for rapid marriage. And if you'll let me explain
  that system to you thoroughly, I'll surely be the proudest son that the ships
  of Ragusa ever sent forth in search of treasure!"</p>
