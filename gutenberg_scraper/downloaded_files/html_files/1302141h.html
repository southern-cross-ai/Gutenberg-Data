<h1>The Philistine: A Story</h1>
<h4>by</h4>
<h2>E M Delafield</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Published in <i>Harpers Magazine</i>, May 1926</h3>
<hr>
<p>He was rather a stolid little boy, but they did their very best
with him.</p>
<p>He had, of course, exactly the same treats as the other
children, the same pleasures, the same privileges. His toys and
presents were better than theirs, if anything, because his aunt, in
her heart of hearts, knew him to be less attractive than her own
Cynthia and Jeremy and Diana.</p>
<p>For one thing, Colin wasn't as good-looking as they were, and
for another, he was less intelligent. Cynthia, at nine years old,
had a vivid, original mind, and the few people&mdash;but they were
people who really knew&mdash;to whom Lady Verulam showed her little
poems had seen great promise in them.</p>
<p>Jeremy, a year younger, had thick, tight curls of brown hair all
over his head, beautiful, long-lashed brown eyes, and an adorable
smile. His manners were perfect. He said things&mdash;innocent,
naive, irresistible things&mdash;about God, and the fairies, and
how much he loved his mother.</p>
<p>Lady Verulam's youngest girl, Diana, was precociously
intelligent too, with a delightfully extensive and grown-up
vocabulary at five years old. She had straight, square-cut bobbed
brown hair like Cynthia, but she was lovelier than either of the
others, and her eyes were a pure, deep blue, fringed with long,
curled black lashes.</p>
<p>All Lady Verulam's artist friends wanted to paint Diana, but
only Sir Frederick Lorton, the best known portrait-painter in
England, was allowed to do so. The portrait was exhibited at the
Royal Academy.</p>
<p>Colin was the only child of Lady Verulam's widowed
brother-in-law, and he had been sent home to her from India when
his mother died. He had been five years old then, and now he was
eight.</p>
<p>He was a dear little boy, and Lady Verulam felt remorsefully
that he might have been a<i>darling</i> little boy if it hadn't
been that Cynthia and Jeremy and Diana unconsciously set such a
very high standard of charm and intelligence. Intelligence counted
for so very much, in that political-artistic section of society in
which the Verulams lived. Most children of wealthy parents could be
made tolerably pretty, after all, and if they weren't born with
brains and personality they stood little chance of individual
distinction.</p>
<p>Not that Colin hadn't got personality.</p>
<p>Lady Verulam, who was President of the Cult of the Children
Society, and had written a little book about child-psychology, had
studied Colin on his own merits, as it were. And she quite
recognized that he had character, and even imagination, of a sort,
although when the children were all taken to see "Peter Pan" and
told to clap their hands if they believed in fairies, he was the
only one of Lady Verulam's large party who didn't clap.</p>
<p>"But I<i>don't</i> believe in them, really," said Colin, rather
pale.</p>
<p>"But Tinker-Bell!" protested Jeremy, "She'd have died if we
hadn't clapped!"</p>
<p>"And we do believe in fairies," said Cynthia firmly.</p>
<p>"Then it was all right for you to clap," said Colin. "There were
enough of you without me."</p>
<p>But afterwards he was very silent for a long while and looked
worried.</p>
<p>Lady Verulam saw that and she changed her seat in one of the
intervals and came beside him.</p>
<p>"Do you like it, darling?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," he said, unusually emphatic. But his face hadn't
grown scarlet with excitement, like little Diana's, and he wasn't
delightfully, stammeringly enthusiastic, like Jeremy. Presently he
asked Lady Verulam in rather a troubled way:</p>
<p>"I wasn't unkind or naughty, was I, not to clap for Tinker
Bell?"</p>
<p>"Not at all," she was obliged to answer. "The children were only
asked to clap if they believed in fairies."</p>
<p>"I don't really believe in them," Colin said apologetically. "Do
you, Aunt Doreen?"</p>
<p>"Shall I tell you a secret?" she answered, bending her charming,
smiling face down to his. "I like to<i>pretend</i> that I believe
in fairies, little Colin."</p>
<p>Anyone of the others would have responded to her whimsical
fancy&mdash;they'd have understood. But Colin only looked up at her
with solemn gray eyes staring rather stupidly out of a puzzled
face.</p>
<p>"Do you?" was all he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, belovedest, isn't it marvelous!" said Cynthia, her eyes
shining and dancing with sheer rapture.</p>
<p>Well, Colin hadn't got the same capacity for enjoyment, that was
all. And even if he'd had it, he wouldn't have been able to express
it in words.</p>
<p>He was an<i>ordinary</i> child.</p>
<p>"He'll never suffer as much as I'm afraid my darlings will,
because he'll never feel as much," said Lady Verulam to the French
nursery governess, who had so many certificates of her training as
a teacher, and as a student of psychology, and as a hospital nurse,
that she was as expensive as a finishing-governess.</p>
<p>"Probably not, Lady Verulam. But I think they do one another
good. Cynthia's and Jeremy's enthusiastic ways will help Colin to
be less stolid in time. And in one way, of course, it's a relief
that he's not as excitable as they are."</p>
<p>The head-nurse said the same.</p>
<p>Diana before a party or a pantomime was positively ill with
excitement sometimes. They never dared to tell her of anything
until just before it was going to happen.</p>
<p>But Colin never looked forward to things like that. He lived in
the present.</p>
<p>"Such a relief," said Lady Verulam rather wistfully. She
couldn't help wondering sometimes what her brother-in-law, Vivian,
would think of his only child, when he came home...But Colin's
mother, whom she had known well as a girl, had been rather stolid,
too.</p>
<p>Every day the children went to play in Kensington Gardens. The
little procession came out at the front door of the house in
Lowndes Square, and Lady Verulam, who adored her children, watched
them from the window of the dining room where she was having
breakfast after her ride in the Park.</p>
<p>First the under-nurse and the footman, carefully lifting the
smart white perambulator down the steps, then Nurse, in stiff white
piqué, carrying the rose-colored silk bundle that was the
four-months-old baby, and depositing him carefully among his lacey
shawls and pillows, under the silk-fringed summer awning of the
pram. Then Diana, adorable in a tiny, skimpy frock of palest lemon
color, with lemon-colored streamers falling from her shade hat and
sandals on her beautiful little slim brown feet. She was carrying a
ridiculous little doll's parasol and walking by herself, just as
she always did. There was a certain dainty pride about Diana that
never allowed her to accept the nurse's hand. She walked by the
side of the pram, erect and exquisite.</p>
<p>After the nursery party, Mademoiselle and the elder children
came down the steps. In the gardens, they would all coalesce, but
the nursery party always started first.</p>
<p>Lady Verulam, peeping out between the window-boxes of scarlet
geraniums and white daisies and the edge of the red-striped sun
blind, watched them.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle was neat, efficient, French-looking&mdash;from the
top of her shiny black straw hat, tipped forward over her black
hair, to the black patent-leather belt placed very low down on her
short-sleeved black-and-white check frock, and the pointed tips of
her buttoned black boots. She was drawing on black kid gloves, that
came half-way up her arms.</p>
<p>One on each side of her, were the two little boys. They were
dressed alike, in white silk shirts and silk ties, and dark
knickerbockers. Neither wore a cap, and Jeremy's thick curls looked
burnished in the strong July sunlight. People always turned to look
at him and at those wonderful curls.</p>
<p>Colin's hair was quite straight, and it suited him best to have
it cut very short. It was of no particular color. Both little boys
held themselves very upright, but while Colin was stocky and rather
short, Jeremy was tall and slim and beautifully made, like a little
statue.</p>
<p>Then Cynthia came out of the house, quick and slender and
radiating vitality in every graceful gesture. Her frock and hat
were the replica of little Diana's, but instead of the minute,
absurd parasol, some heavenly instinct had caused her to take from
the big glass bowl in the hall a handful of great mauve sweet peas
that looked like butterflies against the pale, soft folds of her
frock.</p>
<p>Cynthia's strong, instinctive sense of beauty was a joy to her
mother.</p>
<p>She seemed to dance, rather than walk, along the hot pavement,
her long, slim brown legs bare to the sun. From the little vivid,
glancing gesture of her hands and head, Lady Verulam knew that she
was talking. She could even guess what Cynthia was talking
about&mdash;the party.</p>
<p>They were giving a party the next day on Colin's birthday, just
before going down into the country. It was, actually, three years
since the Verulams had given a children's party. One thing and
another had prevented it.</p>
<p>This was called Colin's party but, as usual, the other children
were far more excited about it than he was.</p>
<p>Lady Verulam herself was a tiny bit excited about it because for
the first time Royalty&mdash;very young Royalty&mdash;was to be her
guest.</p>
<p>She wanted the party to be a great success.</p>
<p>Smiling, she turned away from the window.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Cynthia's mother had been quite right. The children were talking
about the party.</p>
<p>"I'm looking forward to it more than I've ever looked forward to
anything in all my life," said Jeremy solemnly. "I think if
anything happened to prevent it now I'd die."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, you wouldn't," said Cynthia scornfully. "Besides,
nothing <i>could</i> happen to prevent it."</p>
<p>They knew little of disappointments, any of them. They were not
allowed to experience disappointments if their mother could
possibly prevent it because they were such terribly highly strung
children.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle, may Diana be told about the party yet?"</p>
<p>"She may be told, but she isn't to know which day it is till the
last minute," said Mademoiselle, who knew very well that it would
be impossible to keep sharp little Diana from the infectious
excitement and sense of preparation that had already begun to
pervade the house.</p>
<p>So they were able to talk about the party freely when they
joined Diana and the nurses.</p>
<p>Cynthia did not want to talk about anything else, and the others
always followed her lead. Except sometimes Colin, who was what
Nurse called "independent."</p>
<p>He was independent to-day, and when he grew tired of hearing
Cynthia and Jeremy discuss what games they would play at the party,
and Diana chatter about her new frock with the roses on it, he got
up and went away and bounced his ball on the Broad Walk.</p>
<p>He was pleased about the party, and Aunt Doreen had allowed him
to choose what the entertainment should be, and he had chosen a
conjuror, and she had said that<i>perhaps</i> he would have a cable
from Daddy, like last year, for his birthday&mdash;but Colin didn't
feel that he could think, and talk, and plan about nothing but the
party, like the others.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle often said that he had no imagination, and Colin
felt sure that she was right. He wasn't certain that he even wanted
to have an imagination, much. He knew that he was stupid, compared
with Jeremy and Cynthia, but at least he didn't have crying
fits&mdash;like a girl&mdash;as Jeremy occasionally had, and he
didn't stammer from pure eagerness as Cynthia did when she got
excited.</p>
<p>He did hope, very much, that there might be a cable from Daddy
on his birthday, because that would be something of his very own.
No one would be able to say that the others cared more than he did,
because it wouldn't have anything at all to do with the others.</p>
<p>Feeling rather mean but not able to help it, Colin secretly
wished that the others mightn't know anything at all about his
cable if it did come. Then they couldn't exclaim and be excited and
say things and make Colin feel&mdash;and look&mdash;stupider than
ever.</p>
<p>On the way home he was very silent, trying to think of a plan by
which he could prevent the other children from seeing his cable.
Perhaps they'd be so busy getting ready for the party that they
wouldn't remember about it.</p>
<p>When the next day came it really seemed as though it might be
so.</p>
<p>The children flew up and down stairs, even down into the kitchen
where the good-natured chef showed them the cakes, and the jellies
and the pink and white creams, and dishes of colored sweets, and an
amusing log made out of of chocolate with chopped-up green stuff
all over it and cream inside it.</p>
<p>They ran into the dining room, too, and saw the long, decorated
table and the rows of little gilt chairs.</p>
<p>"There are other chairs in the drawing-room&mdash;millions more
of them, for the conjuror," said Diana.</p>
<p>"Let's go up there."</p>
<p>"Let's," said Cynthia and Jeremy.</p>
<p>They dashed off.</p>
<p>Colin was just going to follow when he looked out of the window.
He had been looking out of the window at intervals all day
long.</p>
<p>But this time a telegraph boy really was crossing the square and
glancing up at the numbers. It must, surely, be Daddy's cable, and
he could take it himself and open it and there'd be nobody there to
say that he didn't seem to care half as much as Master Jeremy, not
if it <i>were</i> his own father...</p>
<p>Colin, for once moving quickly, ran out to the hall and opened
the front door before the boy could ring the bell.</p>
<p>"Is it a foreign telegram&mdash;a cable?" he asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>"Yes, addressed Verulam."</p>
<p>"Then it's mine," said Colin with decision. "There isn't any
answer."</p>
<p>He had often heard this said and felt sure it was right.</p>
<p>The telegraph boy, whistling, went away.</p>
<p>Colin retreated to the linen cupboard on the schoolroom landing
which was large and light, and to which people seldom came, and sat
down on the floor to decipher his birthday cable.</p>
<p><i>Regret inform you Major Vivian Verulam dangerously ill
cholera will cable progress.</i></p>
<p>Colin's face slowly became pink and then the color ebbed away
again and left him rather white. He sat on the floor of the linen
cupboard for a long while, not moving.</p>
<p>If Aunt Doreen knew about the cable, the party would have to be
stopped, surely. And Diana would cry herself ill, and everybody
would be in a dreadful state, and what would happen to all those
beautiful cakes? Probably they would be vexed with him, too, for
having opened the telegram.</p>
<p>Colin's mind, his slowly moving, tenacious mind, had not yet
begun to work on the exact meaning of "dangerously ill." For days
he had heard of nothing but the party, and the party had become the
alpha and omega of existence.</p>
<p>It was impossible that it should be stopped. "If no one knows
but me," thought Colin, "it'll be all right."</p>
<p>He had a horrible feeling that it would be naughty to say
nothing about the cable, and yet he felt that they would all blame
him if he told about it and stopped the party. Nothing mattered,
really, except the party. They had thought he didn't understand
what a great event it was because he couldn't get excited like the
others, but at least he could see how very important they all
thought it.</p>
<p>Presently he stuffed the cable into the pocket of his breeches,
rose slowly and carefully to his feet, and went into the schoolroom
again.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>The brilliant, successful party was over, the gilt chairs were
stacked together, seat upon seat, ready to be taken away again, and
the children&mdash;each one with a beautiful present&mdash;had all
long since gone home.</p>
<p>Cynthia and Jeremy and Colin and Diana had been put to bed.
Jeremy had said, "Thank you, you darling, beautiful Mummie, for
such a lovely, <i>glittering</i> party."</p>
<p>His choice of words was always fantastic and charming.</p>
<p>Even Colin had hugged his aunt with unusual enthusiasm and said
he'd never enjoyed any party so much.</p>
<p>"No wonder," said Mademoiselle to Nurse, with whom she was on
friendly terms.</p>
<p>"That conjuror was good, wasn't he?" said Nurse. "The best in
London, they say. I never saw anything like him, myself.
Why,<i>I</i> couldn't have told how he got those toys into the box
with the flags."</p>
<p>"If you please, Nurse," said the under-nurse, entering with her
hands full of little garments, "I found this in Master Colin's
pocket."</p>
<p>She put the crumpled telegram, in its torn envelope, into
Nurse's hands.</p>
<p>Nurse put on her spectacles and read it and said, "What in the
name of gracious&mdash;" and handed the telegram to
Mademoiselle.</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door and the housemaid came in.</p>
<p>"If you please, Nurse, her Ladyship wishes to see you in the
boudoir at once."</p>
<p>"Take this," said Mademoiselle, with presence of mind and gave
back the telegram.</p>
<p>In the boudoir Lady Verulam sat with another telegram open in
front of her. Her pretty face was pale and tearstained.</p>
<p>"Nurse, I'm afraid there's bad news from India. Master
Colin&mdash;poor little boy&mdash;his father is very ill, I'm
afraid. I don't quite understand, but we think&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, my lady. Is it anything to do with this?
Florence found it, opened like that, in the pocket of Master
Colin's every-day pair of knickerbockers."</p>
<p>Lady Verulam read the cable, read it again, compared it with the
one she held, and turned bewildered, almost frightened eyes upon
the nurse.</p>
<p>"But this one must have come before the other one&mdash;the one
I've got," she said. "Who opened it?"</p>
<p>"Master Colin must have done it, my lady. And never said a
word&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He couldn't have understood."</p>
<p>"Is the news in the second telegram worse, my lady?"</p>
<p>"It says that Major Verulam is getting weaker and we must
expect&mdash;" she chocked a little. "We didn't understand and Sir
Frederick is telephoning now to Whitehall, to see if they can give
us any further particulars. But I<i>can't</i>
understand&mdash;"</p>
<p>She looked at the crumpled telegram again and again.</p>
<p>"This must have come hours ago&mdash;before the party.
How<i>could</i> he have got hold of it?"</p>
<p>"The children were all over the place, my lady&mdash;up and down
stairs, watching the men getting things ready. Master Colin might
have got to the door and opened it just when the telegram was
delivered."</p>
<p>"But it was addressed&mdash;oh, oh, poor little boy! It was only
addressed to Verulam. He must have thought it was a cable for his
birthday&mdash;I see&mdash;that's what happened&mdash;that's why he
opened it."</p>
<p>"But, excuse me, my lady, why didn't he say anything to anybody?
He's quite old enough to understand."</p>
<p>Nurse was respectfully indignant, but Lady Verulam was only
tearful and unspeakably bewildered.</p>
<p>"I must go up to him&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, my lady, he's asleep. They all are now, even
Miss Diana, but Master Colin was asleep before any of them, though
not being so excitable as the others."</p>
<p>"Then I can't wake him," said Lady Verulam irresolutely. "It
would only upset him. And there may be news in the
morning&mdash;one way or the other."</p>
<p>There was no more news in the morning, however, and Lady Verulam
was obliged to send for Colin. She wasn't angry with him&mdash;even
if his father hadn't been dying, it was against her principles to
be angry with any child&mdash;but her gentleness met with very
little response.</p>
<p>He didn't seem to understand that his father, whom he scarcely
remembered, was very ill and might be going to die. His lack of
imagination was absolute.</p>
<p>"But why didn't you bring the telegram to me, darling? I quite
understand that you opened it by mistake, but you must have known
it was important and that you ought to tell about it."</p>
<p>Colin began to cry.</p>
<p>She reasoned with him, and petted him, and even spoke severely
to him, but he was sulky and frightened and would not say a word.
At last, in despair, she sent him upstairs again.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Cynthia came flying down to her mother's room,
her lovely mop of hair disordered, her brilliant little face
glowing. "Mummie, may I tell you what I think about Colin? Nurse
doesn't understand&mdash;nor Mademoiselle, nor any of
them&mdash;but I think I do."</p>
<p>"Tell me, precious," said Lady Verulam. She had great faith in
the intuition of this sensitive, intelligent little daughter of
hers.</p>
<p>Cynthia put her arms round her mother's neck and whispered
earnestly.</p>
<p>"I think Colin opened the telegram about poor Uncle Vivian just
before the party, and he did understand what it was, and he thought
it would spoil the party and p'raps&mdash;p'raps put it off
altogether, and that's why he wouldn't say anything. He didn't want
all of us to be unhappy&mdash;he knew we were looking forward so to
the party."</p>
<p>"My darling! What makes you think that?"</p>
<p>"It's what I'd have done," said Cynthia, her eyes shining. "I
would, truly, Mummie, if my heart had been breaking&mdash;I'd have
kept that dreadful telegram all to myself and let all the others
enjoy the party and even have pretended that I was enjoying it
too."</p>
<p>"My sweet&mdash;I believe you would. But if that was it, why
didn't poor little Colin come to me as soon as the party was
over?"</p>
<p>"Mummie, you know you were with the grown-ups who stayed after
we'd gone to bed, and I'm sure he was waiting till you came to say
good-night. And you never did."</p>
<p>"Nurse said you were all asleep&mdash;Colin must have gone
quickly off to sleep, after all."</p>
<p>"But, Mummie," said Cynthia quickly, "he's very little, and one
can't always keep awake, even if it's most important, and Colin
especially, he's always such a sleepy head&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know," said Lady Verulam.</p>
<p>She thought, although she did not say so, that Colin's
insensitiveness had always been rather remarkable, and that where
Cynthia might, as she had just said, have felt her heart to be
"breaking," Colin was quite capable of falling asleep in mere
reaction from an unwonted emotional strain.</p>
<p>She was touched at Cynthia's generous understanding and inclined
to accept her interpretation.</p>
<p>"Poor little Colin!" she said softly. "It was brave and
unselfish of him to want everyone else to enjoy the party
first...although it was a mistake, and I still don't understand why
he couldn't explain to me this morning."</p>
<p>"Mummie, you know Colin never can explain anything," said
Cynthia reproachfully.</p>
<p>That was perfectly true. How clever she was! Lady Verulam kissed
Cynthia in silence. In her heart of hearts she couldn't help
feeling that, dreadful though it was to have been entertaining on
such a scale while her brother-in-law was dying, it would have been
very, very difficult to know what to do if the bad news had reached
her when it should have reached her, just as the preparations for
the party were being completed.</p>
<p>"You do understand about Colin, don't you, Mummie? Because
Mademoiselle isn't being a bit nice to him, and she says he has no
heart and that he didn't show the telegram because he didn't want
the party to be stopped, and then afterwards he was afraid to
tell."</p>
<p>"I'll speak to her," said Lady Verulam. Mademoiselle was always
inclined to be hard on Colin. She couldn't bear what she called his
<i>phleqme britannique</i>. Lady Verulam did not for a moment
believe her interpretation to be the true one. She would sooner
trust to Cynthia's quick sympathies.</p>
<p>According to Cynthia, little Colin had really been rather
heroic. He must have had a dreadful weight on his little mind, all
through the festivities...</p>
<p>Tender-hearted Lady Verulam found the tears rising into her eyes
at the thought of it. She felt as though she had always been unjust
to Colin, who had so little imagination, and couldn't express
himself with fire and poetry and clearness like her own children.
And now perhaps she had alienated him by not understanding or
appreciating his self-sacrifice, and he would be less willing than
ever to talk to her.</p>
<p>Before she saw Colin again a third cable had arrived.</p>
<p>Major Vivian Verulam was not going to die. He had turned the
corner.</p>
<p>The joy and relief of the good news pervaded the house, and even
Mademoiselle kissed Colin&mdash;who rubbed his cheek vigorously
after the salute&mdash;and said nothing more about his having no
heart. But Lady Verulam, who, like her children, was highly strung,
had worked herself up on Colin's behalf, and she told Mademoiselle
and Nurse as well that they had all of them misunderstood Colin,
and that there were unsuspected depths of bravery and unselfishness
in his childish heart.</p>
<p>There came, gradually, to be a feeling throughout the big
household in Lowndes Square that this was so. Colin might be less
wonderful than were Cynthia and Jeremy and Diana, but he, too, had
had his moment&mdash;his exalted and inspired moment.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>Three months later Major Verulam came home on sick leave.</p>
<p>He made friends with his son&mdash;an enduring friendship. They
resembled each other in many ways, and he never seemed to expect or
to desire from Colin enthusiasms and demonstrations that would have
been equally alien to them both.</p>
<p>He was, indeed, the only person who ever heard Colin's own
version of his behavior on the day of the party.</p>
<p>"You see, Daddy, I opened the telegram because I thought it was
from you, for me on my birthday, like the year before, and when I
saw it said you were ill I did think it would mean stopping the
party, and that would have been dreadful."</p>
<p>"Were you so frightfully keen about the party?"</p>
<p>"It wasn't so much that, but there'd have been such a lot of
fuss about it, and they&mdash;all the others&mdash;had been so
excited&mdash;and everything was ready&mdash;men had come all on
purpose to bring the little gold chairs, Daddy, and to arrange the
flowers and things&mdash;It would have been so dreadful, to stop it
all."</p>
<p>"I see what you mean. And certainly it wouldn't have
done<i>me</i> any good, as far as that went. But why didn't you
tell them afterwards, old man? Aunt Doreen wouldn't have been angry
with you, would she?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, she's never angry."</p>
<p>"Well, then&mdash;"</p>
<p>Colin colored faintly.</p>
<p>"You see, Daddy, I didn't know you as well then as I do now, did
I? And the party was fun, and the conjuror such a very, very clever
one."</p>
<p>He gazed up at his father with solemn, trustful eyes.</p>
<p>"I quite and completely forgot all about the telegram till I
woke up next morning," said Colin.</p>
