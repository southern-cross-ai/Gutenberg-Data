</h2>

<p>The dingy little cart containing the clean linen of the Rectory,
was on its way by an unusually roundabout route. Neddy Mellin, the
washer woman's son, who disliked work as much as he liked play,
which was natural in a lad of thirteen, grumbled openly at the
uncongenial task of driving the large white donkey. The animal
herself, who answered to the name of Nelly, grumbled also in her
own way, as she objected to innovations. Hitherto she had been
allowed to take the short road to the parson's residence; now she
was compelled to go by the long one, which was particularly
annoying on this damp, misty November afternoon. With the obstinacy
of her race she refused to trot, and although Neddy whipped her,
coaxed her, and threatened her, Nelly still behaved as though she
were attending a funeral. Mrs. Mellin did not mind. Throned amidst
the bundles of linen, she peered through the fog for something she
particularly wished to see. Only when the cart arrived midway down
a melancholy, deserted thoroughfare, bordered by dripping
elm-trees, did she speak. Then the cart stopped as she fancied she
heard an order.</p>

<p>"There," said Mrs. Mellin, pointing with a fat, red finger at a
dreary mansion which stood in a disorderly garden. "Maranatha! I
never did 'ear of sich a queer name in all my born days."</p>

<p>"It's a scripter name, and has to do with cursing," explained
her son, who, being a choir-boy, knew something about the
Bible.</p>

<p>"Then don't let me 'ear you use sich a wicked word, or I'll take
the skin off your back," said his mother, wiping her large crimson
face with a corner of her tartan shawl. "Maranatha! it gives me the
shivers, it do."</p>

<p>"You're using it yourself," murmured Neddy, in an injured
tone.</p>

<p>"Me, being your elder and your ma, has a right to use words as
ain't fit for you," said Mrs. Mellin, tartly, "and as we've got the
washing of the new gent as has come to live there, I'll say the
name often enough. I'll be bound. But not you, Neddy. Say the
'Ouse, and I'll know what you mean. And for 'Eaven's sake, child
don't 'it the donkey. I want to look at the place."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mellin craned forward so as to get a better view, and
stared at the square, ugly building, the damp red bricks of which
were almost hidden by dark curtains of untrimmed ivy. Smoke came
from one chimney, which showed that the house was inhabited, but as
the shutters were up and the door closed, there was a sinister look
about the whole place which made the washerwoman shiver. In its
wilderness of shrubs and long grass, girdled by gigantic elms, all
sopping and dripping, the mansion loomed portentously through the
mists. It looked like a house with an evil history, and the queer
name on the gate suited it extraordinarily well. Mrs. Mellin was
not imaginative, yet she shivered again as she signed that Nelly
could proceed. Tired of standing and anxious to get her day's work
over, Nelly changed her funeral pace for a more active one.</p>

<p>"Maranatha!" murmured Mrs. Mellin, as the cart turned into the
Parade. "Well, baronet or no baronet, he won't get much good out of
Maranatha. Arter suicides you may paint a 'ouse, you may furnish a
'ouse, and you may advertise 'ouses till you're sick, but them as
comes to live in sich allays leaves afore the term's out. An' no
wonder 'ow long he'll stay?"</p>

<p>"Who'll stay?" asked Neddy curiously.</p>

<p>"I wasn't speaking to you, child. 'Old your tongue and drive on.
I do 'ope as Mrs. Craver ain't 'eard. This will be news for 'er.
And that Emily Pyne is sich a gossip, as never was."</p>

<p>All the way to the Rectory, Mrs. Mellin continued to talk in
this way to herself, while Neddy kept his ears open to drink in
every word. He was a slender boy with a wonderfully delicate
complexion, curly golden hair, and innocent blue eyes, looking, on
the whole, like a stray angel. And when in the choir he not only
looked like an angel but sang like one, as his voice was remarkably
beautiful.</p>

<p>But all Neddy's goods were in the shop-window, since he was as
naughty an urchin as ever existed, to worry a hard-working mother.
He told lies, he played truant, he associated with the worst boys
in the parish, smoked on the sly, and behaved like the unscrupulous
young rascal he truly was. Yet, when necessary, Neddy could play
the saint so perfectly that his conduct, taken in conjuncture with
his angelic looks, quite imposed upon the Rector, who believed him
to be a modern Samuel.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mellin had her doubts, as experience told her otherwise,
but naturally, she kept them to herself, and proclaimed on all and
every occasion that Neddy was too good to live. All the same she
was on her guard against his wiles, and rebuked him sharply when
she noticed that he was listening to her soliloquy. By the time she
had finished telling him where bad boys went and how they fared
when they died, the cart appeared at the Rectory and Mrs. Craver
appeared at the back door.</p>

<p>The parson's wife was a busy, little sharp-faced woman, arrayed
in a shabby black silk, with collar and cuffs of ragged white lace,
carefully mended. The stipend for looking after the souls of the
Hedgerton people was by no means large, and the Rev. George Craver
found it difficult to make both ends meet. Indeed, they would not
have met at all had not Mrs. Craver been a notable housewife, who
looked at both sides of a penny before parting with it, and who
made shillings do the work of pounds. She scraped and screwed and
pinched, and buzzed about the house from dawn till darkness like a
busy bee, keeping her eye on everything and on everyone. According
to custom she welcomed Mrs. Mellin into the kitchen and proceeded
to count the washing, while Neddy sat outside in the cart and
smoked a surreptitious cigarette. After the usual weekly wrangle
over missing articles, scanty starching, bad ironing, and excessive
charging, Mrs. Craver gave the woman a cup of tea and asked
questions.</p>

<p>It was her duty, as she conceived it as the Rector's wife, to
know all that went on in the dull, seaside parish, and Mrs. Mellin
could supply her with more information than most people. Therefore,
Mrs. Craver sent the general servant, who was her solitary
factotum, into the wood-shed to clean knives and brush boots while
she listened to the weekly report. Mrs. Mellin began by a reference
to her sister-gossip and rival spy.</p>

<p>"I do 'ope, ma'am, as that Emily Pyne ain't been tellin' you
things, as she ain't to be depended on, with her silly tongue and
blind eye." The washerwoman spoke as if the lady in question had
only one organ of vision, whereas she had two, and very sharp eyes
they were.</p>

<p>"No. I haven't seen Miss Pyne," said Mrs. Craver, briskly. "Has
she been doing anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"'Eaven forgive her, ma'am; she never does anything right,"
said Mrs. Mellin, piously. "Not that I've got anything against her,
for the time being, 'cept her gossiping constant when she should be
working, and dressing above her station to which she 'ave been
called. No, ma'am, never do I speak against Emily, though she did
try to catch Mellin, when we was gels, failing, nater'ly, when she
'ave a game leg, and remaining a spinster through 'Eaven's 'and
being 'eavy on 'er, may she be forgiven."</p>

<p>"Well, well; what's the news?" Mrs. Craver had heard all about
Miss Pyne's wickedness before, and spoke impatiently.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mellin wiped her face, sipped her tea, and shook her head.
"There ain't no news as is startling, ma'am, as bombs and bloodshed
don't come 'ere while we 'ave the King&mdash;long may he reign over
us. But that 'ouse in Ladysmith Road, as is so unlucky, is let at
last."</p>

<p>"Maranatha?"</p>

<p>"Which the very name do give me the shudders, ma'am. It's a
wicked name."</p>

<p>"It is an odd name," agreed the sharp little woman, "and I asked
the Rector about it. He says it is a Syriac word, meaning the Lord
comes, or has come."</p>

<p>"Neddy told me it was a cuss, ma'am."</p>

<p>"He shouldn't know anything about curses at his age, Mrs.
Mellin. Mr. Craver said that St. Paul used the word as expressing a
curse."</p>

<p>"There now&mdash;" Mrs. Mellin was admiringly
triumphant "&mdash;to think as how Neddy do pick up things. And a
curse is on that 'ouse, Mrs. Craver, ma'am, for never 'ave it been
lucky. The gent as built it fifty years back lost his arm, as my
mother told me; the family as come after him buried two children in
a year; a suicide was the nex' pusson as lived there, and it stayed
empty for years till Mrs. Splurge took it to be ruined by the
breaking of the bank her cash was in and 'ave her daughter run away
with a young man as wasn't what he ought to be. It's a cussed
'ouse, and looks like one."</p>

<p>"H'm! It has a bad history. Well, and who has taken it now?"</p>

<p>"A baronet."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Why should a baronet take a furnished house in this
dull town?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mellin set down her cup and folded her tartan shawl round
her in quite a tragic manner. "That's what I arsk myself, ma'am,"
she said, impressively. "Mrs. Splurge, 'oping to make money after
losing her all, advertised the 'ouse to be let furnished. But for
two years it hev been standing as empty as my 'usband's 'ead,
people fighting shy of its bad luck, as you might say, Mrs. Craver,
ma'am. And now Sir 'Ector Wyke hev come, bag and baggage, with a
'ousekeeper as I hevn't seen, though write me she did, saying as
she'd engaged me to do the washin'."</p>

<p>"Sir Hector Wyke?" Mrs. Craver searched her memory. "I seem to
have heard the name before."</p>

<p>"'Ave he done anything bad?" inquired the washerwoman, eagerly.
"Anything as would make 'im 'ide his guilty 'ead. Baronets is bad,
as we know."</p>

<p>"Rubbish! Baronets are no worse than other people. But I fancy I
have heard my son, Mr. Edwin, mention the name. I'll ask him about
Sir Hector when he comes down at the week end."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't be surprised if Mr. Edwin 'ad quite a gory story to
tell." said Mrs. Mellin, hopefully, for, like all her class, she
loved horrors. "Anyhow. I'll keep my eye on the 'ouse and the
'ousekeeper."</p>

<p>"What is her name?"</p>

<p>"Vence, she writes it. Jane Vence, and a heathen name it is,
ma'am. I haven't set eyes on her myself; but one as hev tole me ses
as she's an old witch in looks, with a tongue as wicked as that of
Emily Pyne's, and I can't say wuss nor that."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vence." The Rector's wife repeated the name so as to
remember it. "And what other servants?"</p>

<p>"None." burst out Mrs. Mellin, triumphantly, "And that's the
wust of it, ma'am. I do say as a baronet should be'ave as a
baronet, and not come to live in a musty, fusty old 'ouse with one
old woman."</p>

<p>"It is strange. When did Sir Hector come?"</p>

<p>"Two days ago, ma'am. I wonder you 'aven't 'eard."</p>

<p>"No. You bring the news to me."</p>

<p>"And proud I am to do so, me thinking as Emily Pyne would be
before'and. I s'pose the Rector will call, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"I suppose he will. We don't often have a baronet come to
Hedgerton."</p>

<p>"And the Rector 'ull find out all about Sir 'Ector, I
s'pose?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mellin, you are much too curious about your neighbours,"
said Mrs. Craver, severely, and quite overlooking the fact that she
was encouraging the woman to gossip. "Learn to mind your own
business, and don't pry into other people's concerns. Probably Sir
Hector has heard that the air is good here, and has come down for
the benefit of his health."</p>

<p>"Ho!" Mrs. Mellin rubbed her nose and took no notice of the
rebuke. "He's ill then, is he?"</p>

<p>"Now I come to think of it, Edwin did mention his name,"
murmured Mrs. Craver to herself, while the washerwoman strained her
ears to listen. "Sir Hector Wyke? Yes. He is a rich man, very
popular and fashionable in London. Not so young as he was, and
engaged to a young lady."</p>

<p>"She hev throwed him over." cried Mrs. Mellin, eagerly, "and his
'eart is broke, so he hev come down 'ere to pine away and die.
'Eaven, what grass we are, and 'ow soon we're cast inter the
oven!"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Mrs. Mellin. Sir Hector has probably come down
for his health, and wishing to be quiet has only brought his
housekeeper with him. There is no mystery about the matter."</p>

<p>"Baronets who live in style don't come to cussed 'ouses with one
old woman to look after them." said Mrs. Mellin doggedly. "Mark my
words, ma'am, there's going to be a tragity at Maranatha, and it
won't be the fust, ma'am."</p>

<p>"We don't have tragedies here, you foolish woman."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't we, ma'am?" Mrs. Mellin stood up to give her words
due effect. "Why, that 'ouse in Ladysmith Road is full of 'em. And,
if you remember, Richard Jones beat his wife to death only five
years back, and Mrs. Warner ran away with the purser of a ship as
went to Chiner; while the children as hev been scalded to death and
drownded is 'undreds, you might put it. No tragity!" Mrs. Mellin
snorted. "Why, ma'am, my own sister Laura was in one."</p>

<p>"She only ran away." said Mrs. Craver, also standing up to
intimate that the conference was ended.</p>

<p>"And 'oo did she run with?" inquired the washerwoman
mysteriously, "She was 'ere to-day and gone to-morrer, as you might
say. Twenty and more years ago she was as lovely a gel as you ever
see, but disappear she did, leaving nothing be'ind to tell her
whereabouts, and not a line hev I 'ad since. Why, you remember
Laura yourself, ma'am, as you was only a five year bride when you
come 'ere with Mr. Craver."</p>

<p>"I remember that your sister disappeared during the first year
of my husband becoming Rector of Hedgerton," said Mrs. Craver,
drily. "She was a pretty girl, but flighty and discontented. And as
she was always fond of the theatre, I daresay she went on the
stage. Of course, as she was twenty-five when she disappeared, she
was old enough to choose her own way, although I can't say that
either I or Mr. Craver approved of her choice."</p>

<p>"'Ow do you know, ma'am, that she made that choice?" questioned
Mrs. Mellin, with dignity. "Play-acting Laura loved, there's no
denying, but she mightn't have gone play-acting after all. No,
ma'am, some villain lured 'er away when she was parlourmaid in
Maranatha with the wife of the gent as cut 'is throat in the back
room. No wonder I shiver when I 'ears the name, ma'am, for that
'ouse was the ruin of my lovely, innercent sister."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mellin, you are allowing that house to get on your
nerves&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Me being a marter to 'em and taking 'og-'ead's of physic."
murmured Mrs. Mellin.</p>

<p>"So think no more about the matter. Take Sir Hector Wyke's
washing and be thankful. Meanwhile, tell me more news, and be as
quick as you can."</p>

<p>Mrs. Craver made this request so as to lure Mrs. Mellin from the
subject of the house in Ladysmith Road, as she saw plainly enough
that the woman was becoming quite hysterical over the place. The
laundress fell into the trap and talked of this person and of that
with great gusto, telling what he said and what they said and what
she said, with full details of what all said. Mrs. Craver examined
and cross-examined and re-examined the good lady, and there was
scarcely a person in the place who was not discussed thoroughly. At
the end of half-an-hour the Rector's wife was in full possession of
all that had taken place in the parish during the week, and
mentally arranged the facts so that she might report to her
husband. Not that he wished to hear, being something of a
book-worm. But Mrs. Craver always presented her seven-days' budget
regularly, because she thought that it assisted him in his clerical
work. Perhaps it did, as it certainly kept him advised of all that
went on. When the examination was concluded Mrs. Mellin retired
with many blessings on the head of her hostess and climbed back
into the dingy cart. Neddy, having tossed aside the fag-end of his
surreptitious cigarette, drove away meekly, while Mrs. Craver
witnessed the departure. The washerwoman, still haunted by the
memory of the newly-tenanted house, cried back a warning.</p>

<p>"You'll see, ma'am, as a tragity will 'appen at Maranatha. Mark
me, ma'am."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2" id=

</h2>

<p>When it became known&mdash;chiefly through the agency of Mrs.
Mellin&mdash;that a baronet was living at Maranatha the excitement
was very great. It appeared strange to one and all that a titled
and wealthy gentleman should leave the pleasures of London to take
up his residence in a dull place such as Hedgerton truly was.
Originally a rude fishing village, it had of late years been
exploited by the jerry-builder, so that it might be improved into a
watering-place and a play-ground for trippers. A huddle of quaint
houses was buried in a hollow by the shore and faced the estuary of
the Thames into which stretched for no great distance a rough stone
pier. Sometimes floating on water and sometimes stranded on mud
were many fishing-smacks, which went out regularly to the harvest
of the sea, while river steamers occasionally called to discharge
cargoes or to land passengers. Since Hedgerton had been dignified
by the name of a watering-place the steamers called more
frequently, especially in summer, and on the whole did fairly well.
But somehow they did not bring to Hedgerton the prosperity
anticipated by the jerry-builder.</p>

<p>The place did not thrive in spite of doctors' recommendations,
cheap fares, and lavish advertisement. Above the hollow wherein
nestled the original town stretched a flat, well-wooded country,
dotted sparsely with houses, and there was a railway station at
Redleigh, three miles away. New Hedgerton, as it was called,
consisted of many hastily-built bungalows extending in a lean line
along the cliffs, but those were occupied only in summer, and
therefore remained empty for the greater part of the year. There
was an asphalt esplanade running spaciously from east to west in
front of these bungalows, a small bandstand, and a crude hall for
public entertainments roofed with galvanised iron. At intervals
roads branched at right angles from the esplanade, passing between
houses old and new to run finally through woodlands or between the
hedges which divided vast meadows from the highway. In spring and
summer the country looked very picturesque with the foliage of
trees, the blossom of orchards, and the rainbow hue of
multitudinous flowers, but the change was marked in autumn and
winter. Then the balmy air grew raw and chill; there were damp
mists overlying the land morning and evening, while the lack of
life gave the place a melancholy aspect. At the fall of the year
the inhabitants of the district retired into their houses like
rabbits in burrows, as the climate of this particular part of
England did not tempt them to lead an out-of-door life. On the
whole, therefore, Hedgerton was not a desirable locality either for
a pleasure-seeker or for an invalid in summer.</p>

<p>This being the case, the Hedgerton gossips asked one another
daily why Sir Hector Wyke had come down to the place during the
season of mists and rain, of leafless boughs and ruined orchards.
No one was able to give an answer, although it was frequently
suggested that the baronet's health was bad. But a man in bad
health would scarcely come to so unhealthy a place at so unhealthy
a time.</p>

<p>Therefore, there must be some other reason. Everyone tried to
learn what it was, and everyone failed. No information was supplied
by the tenant of Maranatha, who lived a very secluded life and
appeared greatly desirous to be left to himself. He saw no one, and
when he took his solitary walks he spoke to no one. Even Mr. Craver
was denied admittance when he sought to welcome the stranger to his
parish and he returned home to tell his wife that Wyke was probably
a misanthropic creature, who disliked his fellow-men.</p>

<p>The description aroused Mrs. Craver's curiosity, and she was
even more particular than usual in examining Mrs. Mellin when that
spy came to report what had taken place in the parish during the
week. The washerwoman could only state, after three weeks watching,
that her bills and the bills of the tradespeople were paid
regularly, and she saw no one but Mrs. Vence, who was not inclined
to be communicative, and that the house appeared to be as neglected
now as it was when Sir Hector first went to live in it. It would
seem that the mysterious baronet did not so much live in Maranatha
as camp in it, since no attempt was made to brush up the residence
or improve the garden in any way. Sir Hector, save for occasional
walks, stayed indoors, like a snail in a shell, and Mrs. Mellin
augured ill from this suspicious retirement. She chiefly blamed the
house itself for the doings of its tenant.</p>

<p>"There's a cuss on it," she declared with relish, when Mrs.
Craver was speculating as to the meaning of the whole queer
business. "If Solomon hisself, as was 'appy with a thousand wives,
lived in that 'ouse he'd ha' been miserable within the week. Why,
the name tells you what it is, ma'am. What do Maranatha whisper to
you but ruin, which there 'as been, and suicide, which 'appened,
and bankruptcy, with the elopement of gels&mdash;which we know is
common there. No ma'am, say what you like, it'll be murder nex';
and 'Eaven be betwixt us and 'arm, save and bless us." Mrs. Mellin
always ended these dismal prognostications with the observation
that she hoped she would not be called upon to give evidence at the
inquest, as murders got on her nerves.</p>

<p>Mrs. Craver was little less fortunate with her son when she
asked questions, for all that Edwin could say amounted to nothing.
Sir Hector Wyke was a rich man, and a popular man, who had been in
the army, and was now a gentleman at large. Edwin had met him in
Society, and liked him fairly well although&mdash;as he put
it&mdash;Wyke was not a man he would care to make a chum of.</p>

<p>Mrs. Craver suggested that he should call on the baronet and
renew his acquaintance, but this Edwin refused to do. He said that
if Wyke wished to improve the acquaintance he could call at the
Rectory, and as the recluse showed no disposition to do this, it
would be best to leave him alone. The Rector agreed with his son,
and Mrs. Craver therefore found herself in the minority. All the
same, she remained intensely curious, and frequently wondered what
mystery lay behind the whole business. She even questioned, in a
delicate way, Hall the postman and Jervis the policeman, but was
unable to learn anything from either. Hall simply said that he
delivered very few letters, which were received by Mrs.
Vence&mdash;whom he described as an old hag, while Jervis declared
that he saw nothing and knew nothing and heard nothing likely to
say why the tenant of Maranatha lived so hermit-like. It was quite
painful for brisk little Mrs. Craver to learn that she could
discover nothing&mdash;she knew the history and daily doings of
every soul in Hedgerton.</p>

<p>"I'm sure, George." she said plaintively, to the Rector,
"one-half the world does not know how the other half lives."</p>

<p>"Then I'm sure it isn't your fault or Mrs. Mellin's or Miss
Pyne's either," retorted her husband, whereat she was offended, and
wondered more than ever if she would discover the truth.</p>

<p>To inflame her curiosity still more an event occurred at the end
of four weeks which startled her and startled everyone with its
far-reaching consequences. Sir Hector had been leading his secluded
life for quite a month when the event happened. It began in quite a
commonplace way with the delivery of a letter by Hall at Maranatha.
About seven o'clock on a foggy November evening Hall was travelling
along the esplanade on his red-painted Government bicycle when he
alighted to examine his bag. He knew that he had delivered all
letters save one, and searched his bag to find the last missive. By
the light of the lamp the postman looked at the address, and saw
that it was directed to Sir Hector Wyke at Maranatha. With a grunt
of satisfaction that his duties for the day would soon be over,
Hall was about to mount his machine again when Jervis appeared. The
bulky form of the constable loomed portentously through the mists,
and Hall guessed who he was.</p>

<p>"Jervis," said the postman, pausing for a moment.</p>

<p>"Hall," answered the officer, as if delivering a countersign,
and flashed his bull's-eye on the weather-beaten face of the first
speaker, "a shocking night, ain't it? Rain and fog, and bitter
cold."</p>

<p>"Why not? 'Tain't June roses as you'll smell in November,
Jervis."</p>

<p>"No, worse luck, and night dooty ain't no catch at this time of
the year. Now, I'll be bound, Hall, as you're nearly finished, and
can get home to your warm bed sharp."</p>

<p>"And to tripe and onions, as my old woman does do a turn,
Jervis," said Hall, licking his lips. "I've only got this one
letter to deliver to Sir Hector Wyke, as folks is talking about
so."</p>

<p>"Don't see why they should talk," said the officer bluffly. "Sir
Hector pays his way and keeps himself quiet. Ain't any of my
business, or of yours."</p>

<p>"But he never sees no one, and never comes out, and never has
any callers."</p>

<p>"He's got one to-night," said Jervis unexpectedly. "You know
Sankey?"</p>

<p>"Him as drives the trap to and fro this place and Redleigh?"</p>

<p>Jervis nodded and stuck his big thumbs in his belt. "Got a
rotten old fly on the job. Well, I saw it to-night with a fare in
it, when Sankey stopped to ask me where Maranatha was. I gave him
the tip as it was in Ladysmith Road, so Sankey drove off. I wonder
his blessed old nag did the three miles without falling a
corpse."</p>

<p>"Did you see who was the fare?" asked Hall, pondering.</p>

<p>"No. Wasn't any of my business. I see you're as curious as the
rest of 'em about that bar'nit. Why, Mrs. Craver herself has asked
questions by the dozen, as you might say. Anyhow, Sankey left his
passenger at Maranatha and drove back to Redleigh, for I see him
returning."</p>

<p>"Oh," remarked Hall, in guttural tones, "so his fare stops all
night with Sir Hector, I s'pose."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he or her, for whether the fare was a male or a
female I don't rightly know."</p>

<p>"Well, Sir Hector ain't 'ad no one to stay with him before."</p>

<p>"Dessay," returned the policeman, carelessly, "but he has to
make a start. I just tell you what, Hall, you're getting like the
rest of the folk hereabouts with their jaw."</p>

<p>"Sir Hector do live such a queer life, Jervis."</p>

<p>"He lives the life as pleases him, as I s'pose he's got the
right to."</p>

<p>"I tell you there's something strange in a baronet coming down
to this dull place when the weather's so bad," persisted the
postman, ominously. "Have you seen the gent?"</p>

<p>"Twice. A little gent with a waxed moustache and dressed up to
the nines with fine clothes. I touched my helmet but he only
nodded, and never stopped to pass the time o' day."</p>

<p>"Well, he wouldn't, he being a swell and you only a copper,
Jervis."</p>

<p>"That's a nasty way of talking, Hall. S'pose I was to report you
to your superior for idling when your letter should be
delivered."</p>

<p>"And s'pose I was to tell Sergeant Purse at Redleigh as you
stopped me on the esplanade to gossip about what ain't any business
of yours," retorted Hall, tartly. "Two can play at that game,
policeman."</p>

<p>"Go and earn your salary." said Jervis, loftily, and walked
away.</p>

<p>"You go and hang yourself," was the not very obvious reply of
the postman; and the two opponents were parted by the heavy fog
which dropped its curtain between them.</p>

<p>Chuckling over having had the last word, Hall mounted his
machine and pedalled slowly round the corner, only too anxious to
deliver the last letter and get home to his tripe and onions. He
knew that the next turning was in Ladysmith Road, and it was as
well that he did, for the mists were so thick that he proceeded
with some difficulty. The man could hear the noise of the waves
through the fog, and shivered in the chill, raw air. As there were
few lamps he found himself in complete darkness when he bicycled up
the road, and therefore had to ride cautiously. Finally, he was
compelled to dismount, and take his machine on to the pavement,
feeling for guidance along the fence on the right-hand side.
Shortly he came to the first gate, and the electric torch he
carried showed him in black-painted letters "The Firs," but he
passed that gate as not being the one he wanted. The second gate he
also passed, as it was inscribed "The Elms," and then he walked for
quite a long way in the dense gloom to find Maranatha which stood
by itself. Finally, he stumbled on the third gate, the inscription
of which told him that he had reached his goal when he flashed the
electric torch on to the black letters. Hall left his machine
leaning against the fence in the dim light of the street
lamp&mdash;for at this point there was one&mdash;and opened the
gate to walk slowly up the path between the tangled herbage and
under the dripping trees. It curved gradually&mdash;a cobble-stone
path overgrown with weeds&mdash;until it ended in an open space
before the house. Through the mists a light beamed from a fanlight
over the door, and Hall, anxious to get home, rapped loudly in the
approved style of the postman. There was no answer, although he
waited for quite a minute, and he searched with his torch for the
letterbox. Just as he found it and was about to slip in the letter
the door suddenly opened. A stream of radiance poured forth to
illuminate the untidy garden, and a man dashed out in a violent
hurry. In his exit, he drove Hall against one of the brick pillars
of the porch, and by the time the postman recovered his breath the
man had disappeared, running swiftly.</p>

<p>"Here's a rum go," said Hall, speaking to himself. "I wonder if
that's the blessed baronite, and what he's up to? Here!&mdash;" he
raised his voice as he faced the open door "&mdash;anyone in? I
can't wait here all night!"</p>

<p>There was no reply. The house preserved an ominous silence,
which made Hall shiver, as Mrs. Mellin had done. Fearing that there
was something wrong, and remembering the sinister chatter of the
neighbourhood, Hall stepped hastily into the hall. It was of no
great size, carpeted throughout, and furnished with a black oak
settle on one side and a small rosewood table on the other,
together with a hat-rack and an umbrella-stand. Doors were visible
right and left; while beyond were stairs and a narrow passage
beside them leading towards the back of the house. A swinging lamp
illuminated the hall, and in its light everything appeared to be
dusty and uncared for. Mrs. Vence certainly was not a particularly
good housekeeper, or she would not have neglected her work in this
fashion.</p>

<p>Astonished by the continued silence, the postman stood
hesitating in the hall, while the sea-fog poured in like smoke
through the open door. He did not know what to do. The sudden
opening of the door, and the violent exit of the unknown man, and
now this ominous silence disconcerted Hall. He had just opened his
mouth to call again, when there came the sound of a long, faint
sigh, and the door on the left opened slowly to reveal the
tottering figure of an old woman. She gasped when she saw the
postman, and suddenly appeared to gather strength as she moved
forward to seize his arm.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" she demanded, faintly, and with a gasp. "Did you
catch him?"</p>

<p>"Catch who, Mrs. Vence?" asked Hall, placing the letter on the
rosewood table, since Mrs. Vence did not seem capable of taking
it.</p>

<p>"The man who ran out."</p>

<p>"No. He opened the door and pushed past me, and bolted."</p>

<p>"Bolted!" Mrs. Vence screamed. "The villain!"</p>

<p>"Come!" With unnatural strength she dragged the startled postman
through the door on the left and into a comfortable study, cleaner
in looks than was the hall. On the hearthrug before the fire lay a
man in evening dress face upward with a knife in his heart. Hall
uttered a cry of horror, and his teeth chattered like castanets.
"Murder!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Murder!" echoed Mrs. Vence, with a shrill scream. "He did
it&mdash;the man who bolted. Catch him. Catch him!" She pushed the
postman fiercely out of the room in a tremendous hurry. "Get a
policeman. Catch him. Quick! Quick!"</p>

<p>Hall did not need much urging. With a pale face and dry lips he
ran out of the house, down the path, and through the gate,
intending to mount his bicycle and race for Jervis, who could not
be far away. Then he made a startling discovery. His bicycle was
gone. Not a sign of it remained.</p>

<p>"The murderer has gone off on it," said Hall, blankly.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_3" id=
"Chapter_3"></a>Chapter 3</b>
</h2>

<p>Hall was astonished to find that his bicycle had vanished. Taken
by surprise he could only stand at the gate and stare helplessly
about him. At last, thinking that something must be done, he
shouted wildly for Jervis. In his agitation it never occurred to
him that the policeman might be at the other end of the esplanade.
As it happened, however, Jervis was close at hand, and shortly his
voice boomed strangely out of the mists.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble? Is that you Hall?"</p>

<p>"He's dead! He's got a knife in his heart!" gasped the postman,
who was clinging to the fence and feeling sick.</p>

<p>Jervis suddenly loomed hugely out of the fog, and entered into
the circle of blurred light cast by the street-lamp. "Who is dead?"
he asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Sir Hector Wyke," babbled Hall, whose nerves were very much
shaken. "I saw him lying dead. Mrs. Vence showed me his corpse. My
bicycle is gone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gone!" Jervis shook the terrified man. "Why I saw your bicycle
slip along under the lamp nigh which we were talking on the
esplanade. I come here straight when I hear your voice, wondering
why you should be in the Ladysmith Road and your
bicycle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was the murderer, Jervis. He dashed past me when I stopped
at the door yonder to deliver the letter you saw. He has taken my
bicycle. Stop him. He ought to be hanged. Oh, oh, oh!" He broke
down, shivering and crying.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool. Pull yourself together," commanded Jervis,
gruffly. "How can I follow in this fog, and with no machine to
catch him up with? Go to the telegraph-office, and wire Sergeant
Purse at Redleigh that a murder has been committed at Maranatha,
and that the criminal has escaped on a Government machine. He can't
go far on a red-painted bicycle without being captured, though the
fog may help him to win clear. Off with you, Hall, and I'll go into
the house."</p>

<p>Hall nodded feebly, "I always thought that there was something
strange about the baronet."</p>

<p>"We ain't got time to talk about the bar'nit. You go and do what
I tell you."</p>

<p>Thus commanded, the postman, whose nerves were all unstrung by
the sight he had seen and the tragedy which had occurred, crawled
slowly down the road into the misty darkness, clinging to the fence
to aid his progress. Jervis listened for a minute or so until the
footfalls of his messenger had died away, then assumed an official
expression of stern determination, and strode up the weedy
path.</p>

<p>The door was still open, and Mrs. Vence stood upon the
threshold. From her first words it was very evident that she had
overheard the order. "Do you think Sergeant Purse will stop the
bicycle at Redleigh?" she asked, feverishly, and laid a trembling
old hand on the policeman's arm.</p>

<p>"I can't say. Don't seem to me as a likely thing to happen in
this fog, to say nothing of the fact that this criminal mayn't go
through Redleigh. I suppose the man who escaped is the
criminal?"</p>

<p>"If sticking knives in folks' hearts is murder, he is," retorted
Mrs. Vence, in a tart way, "and you oughter go after him at
once."</p>

<p>"I ought to see the body at once," was the gruff reply. "'Taint
much good my going on a wild goose chase in this fog. Don't you
tell me my dooty, ma'am, for I know it; none better. And be careful
what you say, as anything you do say will be used as evidence
against you."</p>

<p>"Against me?" cried the housekeeper, shrilly. "Me is as
innercent as an unborn babe. Well I never," and she looked furious
enough to claw the ruddy face of the gigantic constable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vence was a small and stout woman, with a brown, withered
face seamed with innumerable wrinkles. She had abundant white hair,
unbrushed and tangled, which added to her witchlike aspect as she
peered indignantly at Jervis through horn rimmed spectacles. A
stuff dress of faded blue, a dingy knitted shawl of red wool
tightened over rounded shoulders, and a pair of ragged slippers
formed her attire, so that she looked a perfect fright, maliciously
observant, and aggressively disagreeable. The constable paused for
a single moment to wonder why a gentleman should engage such a
dirty and disreputable female as a housekeeper.</p>

<p>"You haven't touched it?" queried the policeman, examining the
body of the dead man.</p>

<p>"Me?" Mrs. Vence began to thrill again. "Why, I haven't had time
to touch it, and I wouldn't have touched it if I had had time. I
just came in with a tray and let it fall when I saw him bending
over my poor master as he'd killed. I dropped myself and dropped
the tray when I fainted, more or less, but not quite. I heard as in
a dream," exclaimed the housekeeper, dramatically, "the postman's
knock. He waited for a minute until a second knock came, and then
ran out of the house for dear life."</p>

<p>"By him you mean the criminal. I s'pose?" said Jervis, stolidly.
"Why didn't you stop him?"</p>

<p>"How could I, drat you?" demanded Mrs. Vence, in querulous
tones. "I wasn't myself altogether, being in a faint, and yet not
in one, as you might say. Why, I gathered myself together us soon
as I could and tottered to the door. Then, seeing the post in the
hall, I knowed as I'd got a friend, and shoved him out to catch the
rascal, drat him, and drat you asking me why I didn't."</p>

<p>Jervis hastily noted this statement down in his book, still
kneeling, and would have asked questions, but there came an
interruption.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Vence who mentioned that a third person was present.
"Lawks!" said the old woman, wiping her face with her apron.
"Thought you was gone sir."</p>

<p>At the door stood a tall man, arrayed in a fashionable overcoat,
with a knitted white silk scarf round his neck and a silk hat in
his hand. He had large, powerful limbs, a large nose, a large face,
and was large altogether. His hair and beard and moustache were
iron-grey, and his eyes were as black as the night outside.</p>

<p>Wondering who he was, Jervis noted that he looked a truculent
kind of buccaneer, and rose to confront him, thereby revealing the
body on the hearthrug.</p>

<p>The newcomer at the door uttered a startled ejaculation,
scarcely scriptural, and strode forward in quite a masterful way.
He looked at the dead man aghast, then turned towards the policeman
with an indignant expression, as if he suspected him of being the
culprit. "What does this mean?" demanded the buccaneer, fiercely,
and pointed to the corpse with a silver-headed cane which he held
in his hand.</p>

<p>"Sir Hector Wyke has been stabbed, as you see, sir," said
Jervis, curtly.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" cried the stranger. "My poor friend."</p>

<p>"Was Sir Hector your friend, sir?" The gentleman nodded. "I came
here to see him, and hoped that he would give me a bed for the
night. Dead. Stabbed! Who killed him?"</p>

<p>"The other gent as come," chimed in Mrs. Vence, promptly; "and a
murdering villain he is, sir. Clever too; seeing as he's got away
on the postman's bike."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about him?" asked Jervis, sharply.</p>

<p>"Lawks! and how should I? I never set eyes on him afore this
blessed night."</p>

<p>"The other gent as come," said the stranger, repeating Mrs.
Vence's earlier remark, word for word. "Nonsense. I was the only
visitor Sir Hector had to-night."</p>

<p>"Makin' me out a liar, indeed," cried Mrs. Vence, much offended
by the imputation. "Well, I do say as you've got a face, sir.
Impudence and crime. Oh, little did I think as I'd come to sich a
situation, and me so respectable."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue," said Jervis, so ferociously that the old
creature started and trembled. "Let us get to the bottom of this.
Who are you, sir?"</p>

<p>The other man produced a card. "I am Oliver Lemby," he declared,
in his deep, rich voice. "And dash you, policeman, don't look at me
as I'd got anything to do with this infernal business. I came down
here to see my friend&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In a trap from Redleigh."</p>

<p>"Not all the way," said Lemby, drily. "I travelled by train from
London to Redleigh. Oh! I remember. The driver of the trap stopped
to ask a policeman the way to this house. And you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am the constable of Hedgerton&mdash;the only constable," said
Jervis, stiffly and a trifle imperiously. "Well, sir, and what do
you know of this?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, dash and confound you!" snarled the truculent Mr.
Lemby, who was as aggressive as Mrs. Vence. "I sent the trap away,
hoping that Sir Hector would put me up for the night. This old hag
showed me into the drawing room."</p>

<p>"Did you hear," said Jervis, "anything likely to make you think
that a crime was being committed?"</p>

<p>"Hang you officer! Would I have stayed quietly in the
drawing-room had I guessed for one moment that a murder was being
committed?" demanded Lemby fiercely, and clenching his fist as if
about to strike. "Wyke saw me in the drawing-room when he arrived,
and while we were talking there came a ring at the door. Excusing
himself, and asking me to stay where I was until he came back, he
went down the stairs. I waited and waited until I was tired. Then I
heard the woman shrieking, although I did not hear what she
said."</p>

<p>"I said 'murder,'" observed Mrs. Vence, "and said it loudly,
too."</p>

<p>"Not loud enough for me to hear, however," retorted Lemby, "or I
should have been down before. However, as Wyke did not return, I
suspected, from the voices and the shrieks of this old thing, that
something was wrong, so came down to investigate. Well?"</p>

<p>"Ho!" said Jervis, as he saw no reason to disbelieve the plain
statement. "You will have to wait, sir, until my superior officer
comes along. I have sent the postman to the telegraph office to
wire for him."</p>

<p>"Of course I'll wait, dash you! Do you think I am going to leave
this house without finding who has murdered my poor friend? Why are
you waiting here, officer? Why don't you catch the villain?"</p>

<p>"'Taint easy to catch a man as has gone off on a foggy night on
a bicycle, sir," said Jervis, drily. "I can't tell in which
direction he's gone."</p>

<p>"You could trace a Government bicycle because of the
colour."</p>

<p>"I have wired to my sergeant to watch Redleigh Station for a
red-painted bike, sir. The assassin may go to Redleigh to catch the
express to London."</p>

<p>"Not he, unless he's a born fool," retorted Lemby
contemptuously, "and his action in using the bike to escape shows
that he isn't a fool by any means. I don't think that you'll nab
him easily." He stopped, then looked at the corpse at his feet with
marked emotion. "I suppose poor Wyke is dead?"</p>

<p>"Stone dead. He's been stabbed to the heart, as you see. Look
for yourself."</p>

<p>"No." Lemby shrank back. "I don't meddle with corpses in charge
of the law. I think you should get a doctor."</p>

<p>"Go for a doctor, Mrs. Vence," said Jervis, quickly, and
thinking that this was good advice. "Bring him here
immediately."</p>

<p>"Me!" cried Mrs. Vence, in her usually shrill tones. "Why, I'm a
stranger in this place but a month. I don't know where the doctor's
to be found, 'specially on this misty night. Go yourself, or send
this gent."</p>

<p>"I can't go myself, and the gent doesn't leave this house until
my sergeant arrives," said Jervis, grimly.</p>

<p>Lemby drew himself up. "Officer, do you suspect me, dash
you?"</p>

<p>"I suspect no one, at present. I don't know enough."</p>

<p>"Know enough," echoed the housekeeper contemptuously. "Why,
ain't you heard all what I've told you? It was the beast as went
off on the bike as stabbed my poor master. I saw him bending over
the body when I dropped the tray and the glasses and the wine," and
Mrs. Vence pointed to the tray and the various fragments of glass
on the carpet.</p>

<p>"But who is he?"</p>

<p>"I dunno. I never saw him afore."</p>

<p>"Describe him?"</p>

<p>"He was a short man with red hair and rather stout, like me. I
couldn't see much of him, as he was muffled up in a long black
overcoat with a blue scarf round his mouth and a soft hat pulled
over his eyes. I took him to my master into this very room, and was
told to bring wine and cake in  of an hour. I was coming in with
the wine, having been waiting on the clock in the kitchen, when I
see my poor master dead and him bending over him afore I
faints."</p>

<p>"It's my opinion that we ought to have a doctor," said
Lemby.</p>

<p>Jervis agreed with Mr. Lemby; but as Mrs. Vence did not know
where any doctor lived, and as he was unable to go himself, and did
not intend to let the buccaneer leave the house, it was difficult
to know what to do. But here Providence stepped in to extricate the
trio from this dilemma. A light, quick step was heard in the hall,
and a high, silvery voice called on the housekeeper.</p>

<p>"It's that imp, Neddy Mellin, with the washing," said Mrs.
Vence, hurrying towards the door. "Don't let the child see the
corpse."</p>

<p>She was too late. Neddy suddenly shot into the room, smiling and
angelic in his looks. But the smile died away when he saw the body.
"Crikey!" breathed the lad, turning white, "is the cove a
deader?"</p>

<p>"You leave the washing in the hall and cut!" commanded the old
woman. "How dare you come in by the front door?"</p>

<p>"Neddy," said Jervis, who knew the lad well, as did everyone
else in Hedgerton, "go to Dr. Quin, and ask him to come here at
once."</p>

<p>"And I'll give you a shilling," said Lemby, sitting down.</p>

<p>"I'm fly," said Neddy, promptly, and reluctantly backed out of
the room. He was anxious to earn the shilling, but still more
anxious to gaze on the body. "Let me see the deader when I come
back," he called out.</p>

<p>"Get along with you; get along!" vociferated Mrs. Vence, and
chased him out of the front door into the mists. When she turned
back after closing the door she glanced at the rosewood table on
which Hall had placed the letter. It was gone. There was not a sign
of it to be seen. And the front door had been open from the time
the man had escaped until now. It was very strange.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_4" id=

</h2>

<p>Sergeant Purse, who had come over from Redleigh to take charge
of the matter, was a foxy-faced little man, lean and dried up in
appearance, with beady black eyes like those of a rat. He was
immensely interested in the matter, as he recognised that this was
no common crime, and hoped by tracing the assassin to make a big
reputation as a zealous officer and gain advancement. The
description of the murderer given by Mrs. Vence was largely
advertised, and pointed mention was made of the red-painted
bicycle. In the illustrated daily papers pictures of Hedgerton and
Maranatha appeared, both the inside and the outside of the house
being delineated. Mrs. Vence also shared the honour of this painful
publicity, and her portrait looked like that of an old witch. She
was very much annoyed by this caricature.</p>

<p>"Me like that," screamed the housekeeper, when Sergeant Purse
showed her the picture. "Why, 'taint me at all. 'Tisn't saucy, and
I always had a bit of sauciness about me."</p>

<p>The sergeant, laughed drily. "You were not as young as you
were."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm growing old, I don't deny," snapped Mrs. Vence,
crushing up the paper wrathfully. "Sixty's getting on, say what you
will. But I ain't so bad-looking when all's said and done, although
not so handsome as when a gel. I'm active, too, cooking like an
angel and celebrated for my tidiness."</p>

<p>Purse had his own opinion about this, and, staring at the
disreputable dirty old beldame, wondering for the hundredth time
why a fastidious gentleman had engaged her. "Did you know Sir
Hector before you came here?" he asked, wondering in his own mind
why he had not put the question before.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," retorted Mrs. Vence, alertly. "I saw an
advertisement in the paper as I picked up in a friend's house, and
applied for the situation, saying I could cook and hold my tongue,
so Sir Hector engaged me. I came down here a few days afore he did,
quite a month ago, to get the house ready, and dirty it was, with
that, old Peddler, the caretaker, as didn't half look after the
furniture."</p>

<p>"Why was it necessary for you to hold your tongue?" asked Purse,
seizing on the only phrase in the speech which seemed to be
important.</p>

<p>"Lawks! How should I know? Sir Hector, he says to me, he says,
'Hold your tongue and don't talk, for I wants to be secret and
quiet like for a bit.' Them were his words, and inquisitions won't
make me say otherwise."</p>

<p>"Did he explain why he wished to be secret and quiet like?"</p>

<p>"No, he didn't drat you!" grunted the old woman, who was in a
vile temper. "He just had his dinner about six, when Mr. Lemby
arrived, and I showed him into the drorin'-room. I don't think Sir
Hector, expected him, for he seemed surprised like when I took the
card of the gent into the dinin'-room. But he said nothing to me,
and went up to the drorin'-room to have a chat, s'pose. Afore seven
there was a ring at the door, and the other gent arrived. While I
was asking his business Sir Hector came flying down the stairs and
took him into the study, telling me to come with cake and wine in a
quarter of an hour. I went to the kitchen and watched the clock,
and about seven I walks in, happy-like, into the study, knowing as
I was doing my duty. There I saw Sir Hector a corpse, and the gent
bending over him, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You explained all that before," interrupted the sergeant, who
knew the sequel to the statement.</p>

<p>"Then why did you bother me to say it again?" demanded Mrs.
Vence, crabbedly.</p>

<p>"What was the exact time when the second gentleman arrived?"</p>

<p>"About twenty to seven; and a gent I call him, though I don't
see if he was one when he was muffled up like a Christmas-pudding.
It was twenty to seven, as I know from the kitchen clock, which I
had my eye on so's to bring in the wine and cake
punctual-like."</p>

<p>"Hall, the postman, says that he arrived at the door about
seven, or a trifle afterwards," said Purse, meditatively, "I expect
the murder took place about that time. You heard no noise?"</p>

<p>"Drat you, how could I when in the kitchen at the back of the
house, and me not expecting horrors and corpses. I came into the
study with the victuals and drinks, as I says, and the postman
knocked twice, as I more or, less fainted, while the gent cut like
the wind."</p>

<p>"Did Sir Hector appear to be afraid of his second visitor?"</p>

<p>"No. He seemed to expect him, for he says, 'Oh, you've come,' or
something like that, as he drawed him into the study and sent me
about my business."</p>

<p>"He expected him, then, and was quite friendly."</p>

<p>"You can put it like that if you likes," snarled Mrs. Vence,
hugging herself, and rocking to and fro, "but I'd like to know when
I'm to be let go?"</p>

<p>"After the inquest, which takes place to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And who's going to pay me for what I've had to put up with? I
didn't get no wages from Sir Hector, me having arranged for monthly
payments."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose Sir Hector's heir will pay you, Mrs.
Vence."</p>

<p>"Who's he?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'm off to see Mr. Lemby, who is a friend of Sir
Hector's. I may learn something about the heir from him."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Vence, rising with an ill-humoured look, "the
sooner you get information and them wages the better. I'm
travelling to London myself after the inquest to-morrer, and I do
hope as my next situation won't be police news and chamber of
horrors." She paused, then remarked significantly, "There's the
letter, you know, Mr. Purse."</p>

<p>"What letter?" asked the sergeant, alertly, and pricking up his
ears.</p>

<p>"That as the post delivered when he come. He put it on the table
in the hall when talking to me. I shoved him out, and the policeman
came. Afterwards, that imp, Neddy Mellin. When things was quieter,
I looked for the letter. Never a sign of it, Mr. Purse, though I
hunted careful."</p>

<p>"Who took it?"</p>

<p>"Ask me another," said Mrs. Vence, cunningly. "All I can say is
as the door was open from the time the post came to the time I
chased that imp out, me being too worried to shut it."</p>

<p>"Did the boy take it?" asked the sergeant, rather foolishly.</p>

<p>"Lawks! and why should he? It wasn't nothing to do with him. I
did ask him, and he said as he never saw no letter on the
table."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Lemby&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was in the study with the policeman, and with me and the
corpse," said Mrs. Vence, truculently. "I don't go for to tell
lies, do I? But the door was open all the time, and the fog was
pouring in like steam. If you ask me," added the old woman, slowly,
"I do say as the murderer came back for that letter."</p>

<p>Purse jumped. "Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"'Cause I don't see as anyone else could have taken it. 'Course
it ain't no business o' mine, but the murderer might have slipped
round the corner on the bicycle and waited his chance to
steal."</p>

<p>"He would have acted like a fool had he done that," said Purse,
incredulously.</p>

<p>"Well, well, it's only an idea, as you might say."</p>

<p>"Have you any reason to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I ain't got reasons. But the letter's gone, and as no one
we know took it, someone as we don't know did. And that's sense.
Well, I'm going to make myself some tea, and trim up my popping-out
bonnet, so as to look smart for the sitting on the corpse
to-morrow. This me?" Mrs. Vence glared at the crushed newspaper.
"I'll have the law on him as did it."</p>

<p>"Oh, go away and hold your tongue," said Purse, impatiently.</p>

<p>"I was engaged to hold my tongue," said Mrs. Vence, with great
dignity, and tottered out of the room along the passage and into
the kitchen.</p>

<p>Her repetition of the phrase dwelt in the sergeant's memory as
he walked to the inn where Mr. Lemby was staying pending the
inquest.</p>

<p>Purse entered the little dark and damp sitting-room, where the
buccaneer bulked largely in the twilight atmosphere. It was a
gloomy, grey day, by no means cheerful, and the sergeant was glad
to warm his hands at the fire which Lemby's desire for comfort had
provided. He also suggested a lamp.</p>

<p>"What the dickens should I do with a lamp at twelve o'clock,"
asked Lemby, bluffly. "It's darkish here I don't deny. But if you
think that I'm afraid to show my blamed face let's go outside."</p>

<p>"I never suggested such a thing."</p>

<p>"You hint at it because you think I have something to do with
this confounded murder, sergeant," roared the big man, garnishing
his speech with oaths after his usual fashion.</p>

<p>"Don't talk rubbish, sir," said the sergeant, imperiously, for
although a small man he had a great idea of his own importance.
"There's no evidence to implicate you. All the same, I'm bound to
say that anything you say will be used as evidence against you, if
suspicions are aroused."</p>

<p>"There, dash you! Didn't I say you suspect me?" growled Lemby.
"Well, you have stumbled on a mare's nest, hang you! No one was
more surprised than I was when I stumbled on that policeman and
that old hag dealing with a corpse."</p>

<p>"No one says otherwise," remarked Purse drily. "Undoubtedly the
man who stole the bicycle is the guilty person. Do you know who he
is?"</p>

<p>"No, dash you, I don't. Wyke said nothing to me about seeing
anyone."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you that he expected a visitor?"</p>

<p>"No. The ring came at the door about twenty or fifteen minutes
to seven, and he bolted away, asking me to wait."</p>

<p>"And he did not return?" said the officer, musingly.</p>

<p>"How the deuce could he, when the man had knifed him?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not," said the sergeant, soothingly, for Lemby
was a difficult witness to deal with. "You were a friend of Sir
Hector's?"</p>

<p>"Yes, great friend."</p>

<p>"What do you know about him?"</p>

<p>"What everybody else knows. Everything I know is in the
newspapers, as these infernal reporters have been smelling round
here."</p>

<p>"Was there anything in Sir Hector's past life to lead you to
suppose that he had some secret likely to bring about his violent
death?"</p>

<p>"No. What a dashed roundabout way you have of asking questions!
Why don't you trace that bicycle and catch the assassin?"</p>

<p>"All over the country I have people on the watch. They
may&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and they mayn't," interrupted the buccaneer. "And how long
am I to stay in this rotten hole?"</p>

<p>"Until the inquest is over. It will be held to-morrow. It's
strange," went on the sergeant, "that no relative of Sir Hector's
has appeared to look after his interests. Yet the case is set forth
in the newspapers."</p>

<p>"Wyke has no relatives," said Lemby, grimly plucking at his
beard. "The title becomes extinct. If you don't believe me ask Mr.
Sandal, of Lincoln's Inn Fields, sergeant. He is Sir Hector's
lawyer. I wrote and asked him to come down."</p>

<p>Purse nodded approvingly. "Very wise of you, sir. But why take
this trouble?"</p>

<p>"Because I wish to know where the property goes to. Sir Hector
should, by rights, leave it to my daughter. He was engaged to marry
her."</p>

<p>"Your daughter!" Purse started and stared.</p>

<p>"Yes, dash you! Why shouldn't I have a daughter? Here's the case
in a nutshell, and you can make what you can of it." Lemby paused,
cleared his throat, and continued. "Sir Hector was engaged to marry
my daughter Claudia, though she wasn't overfond of him, since she
loved a chap called Craver."</p>

<p>"That's the name of the Rector of this parish!" exclaimed Purse,
staring hard.</p>

<p>"It's the son I mean, not the father. Well, then, Edwin Craver
loved Claudia; but I refused to allow the marriage as I wanted my
daughter to become a lady of title. Sir Hector proposed, and the
marriage was to have taken place a month ago, as I insisted that
Claudia should become Lady Wyke. Then Sir Hector wrote postponing
the marriage, and came down here."</p>

<p>"What reason did he give?"</p>

<p>"Said his health was bad. I tried to see him and he refused. I
couldn't find out his address for a long time, as he wrote from his
London house. Finally I got it from Craver&mdash;Edwin, I
mean&mdash;and came down the other night to force Wyke to explain
his dashed impudence. While he was explaining the ring came at the
door and he bolted. The rest you know. Well?"</p>

<p>"Well," echoed Purse, vaguely and rather distraught. He did not
know very well what to say, as this new complication took him by
surprise. Edwin Craver loved the girl, Edwin Craver was the son of
the Rector in whose parish the crime had been committed. "Could it
be that Edwin Craver&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Lemby, reading suspicion in the sergeant's eyes.
"Edwin is innocent. I'll swear. In my opinion it was&mdash;" He
hesitated, faltered and broke down, while Purse waited for him to
complete the sentence.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_5" id=
"Chapter_5"></a>Chapter 5</b>
</h2>

<p>Lemby had some difficulty in speaking freely, and hesitated so
pointedly that Purse impatiently assisted him. "Are you going to
tell me who is the criminal?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lemby, promptly, and now speaking readily enough. "I
was about to say that I believe it was a case of suicide."</p>

<p>The sergeant expressed his surprise. "Suicide, when Mrs. Vence
saw the assassin bending over his victim? Ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"It may be ridiculous, or it may not be," replied the buccaneer,
doggedly; "but from what I know of Wyke, he was in no danger from
anyone. Who the man is that Mrs. Vence saw I don't know. But Wyke
might have killed himself and the man might have been bending over
his body to afford succour."</p>

<p>"Ridiculous," replied the sergeant. "If the strange man was
innocent he would scarcely have fled. His flight on the bicycle
proves his guilt. Besides, what reason had Wyke to commit
suicide?"</p>

<p>"What reason had he to postpone his marriage and come down to
this dismal place?" demanded Lemby, sourly. "You are asking me
questions which I cannot answer. Evidently, although I did not know
it, there was some secret in Wyke's life which made him act so
strangely and drove him to suicide."</p>

<p>"I don't believe for one moment that he committed suicide,"
persisted Purse, after a pause, and remembering how Mrs. Vence had
been engaged to hold her tongue; "but he evidently came down here
to escape the man who slew him."</p>

<p>"He might have done so, sergeant." Lemby made a gesture, as if
brushing aside the whole subject. "Anyhow it is a sore blow to me
and to my daughter."</p>

<p>"To you, no doubt, Mr. Lemby, as you lose the gratification of
seeing your daughter bearing a title. But, if she loves young
Craver, as you hint, I think she will be glad that Wyke is
gone."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. She's dashed obstinate. Anyhow, from what I have told
you, sergeant, you must see how absurd it is to suspect me."</p>

<p>"I don't suspect you at all," cried Purse, rising. "When you are
examined at the inquest you will no doubt be able to explain
more."</p>

<p>"I can't explain more than I have already done." growled Lemby,
sullenly. "Is not my explanation satisfactory?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I think it is. From the evidence given by Mrs. Vence, you
did not come down the stairs until the man was dead."</p>

<p>"That policeman of yours can back up that statement," said
Lemby, eagerly, "and, of course, Mrs. Vence saw the assassin."</p>

<p>"Hullo!" Purse turned sharply at the door, "I thought you
believed it was a case of suicide."</p>

<p>"It was merely an idea," protested the other.</p>

<p>"A very silly idea," retorted the sergeant, and took his
departure, leaving Mr. Lemby to his own thoughts, which were those
of disappointment, as he would never see his daughter Lady
Wyke.</p>

<p>During the twenty-four hours which elapsed before the inquest
the sergeant walked round Hedgerton, asking innumerable questions
and noting down innumerable answers. He learnt all about Sir
Hector's way of living, how he kept very much to himself, walked
out alone, spoke to no one, and remained indoors as a rule. He
inquired at the post-office, and discovered that the baronet had
received but few letters, newspapers, and parcels, which were
generally redirected from his town residence. Wyke evidently had
made no secret of his stay in Hedgerton, and in no way could Purse
find that he was in hiding. The man had come down, so it was
supposed, for the sake of the Hedgerton air, and had taken
Maranatha on the three months' lease. Therefore, it might be
supposed that, had he not been killed he would have returned to
London at the expiration of that period to resume his ordinary
life. From Mrs. Vence's hint that she had been engaged to hold her
tongue it would appear that there was some mystery in the baronet's
life; but no mystery could be discovered in spite the sergeant's
persistent questioning. He left off as wise as he was when he
began.</p>

<p>Purse also called to see the Rector and his wife, ostensibly to
ask if they knew anything about the gentleman who had come to
reside in the parish, but really to learn what he could of young
Craver. The intimation of Lemby that his daughter loved the young
man, and that he wished to marry her, gave Purse the idea that
rivalry might be the cause of the tragedy. But on inquiry the
sergeant learnt that Craver came down to see his parents only now
and then at a weeks'-end and had not been in Hedgerton at the time
that his rival in love was killed. Moreover, it appeared that the
young man had not spoken about Miss Lemby to his father or mother,
and they were quite surprised to hear that he had any intention of
marrying. In fact, Mrs. Craver, was indignant when she heard the
story told by Mr. Lemby, and said that Edwin would certainly have
told her had he been in love. She admitted, as did the Rector, that
Edwin knew Wyke, but insisted that he knew him merely as an
acquaintance. If he had been a rival, as the Rector's wife declared
her son would assuredly have spoken against him, whereas he only
mentioned him indifferently when questioned. But, as Purse pointed
out, if young Craver kept his wooing of Miss Lemby secret from his
parents, he would scarcely have talked about the man she was being
forced to marry. The sergeant left the rectory with a feeling of
disappointment. So far as he could gather from the frank speech of
Mr. and Mrs. Craver, their son had nothing to do with the
crime.</p>

<p>The inquest took place in the Entertainment Hall&mdash;that
shabby building with the roof of galvanised iron, which was on the
esplanade. Sergeant Purse stated all that he knew, which was little
enough, and terminated his evidence with the surprising information
that a telegram had arrived from the Waking police-office saying
that the bicycle had been found. The constable who had found it
would appear in due course to relate how it had been discovered.
But, as the sergeant added, there was no trace to be found of the
man who had stolen the same. This announcement caused some
excitement, as there appeared a chance of getting at the truth,
but, on the whole, Purse's statement caused prosaic, and his
evidence was anything but sensational.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vence was then questioned, and repeated her story much in
the same words as she had used when telling it to Jervis and his
superior officer.</p>

<p>From her evidence the jury gathered that she had been engaged by
Sir Hector, who told her to do her work and hold her tongue. She
had come down a few days before her master had taken over Maranatha
from Pedder, the caretaker, so as to put it in order. The Coroner,
weary of hearing nothings, pointedly asked her why Wyke had
requested her to hold her tongue.</p>

<p>"He didn't ask me to hold my tongue," said Mrs. Vence, tartly.
"He asked me if I could hold my tongue; and that's a different pair
of shoes."</p>

<p>"Well, and why did he?"</p>

<p>"How should I know? I never was one to chatter; and there wasn't
anything to chatter about, so far as I could see. I did my work,
and he read and walked and slept, seeing no one, and keeping
silent."</p>

<p>"He saw no one save Mr. Lemby and the man who escaped on the
bicycle?"</p>

<p>"You're right there, if ever you was right in your life," was
Mrs. Vence's reply.</p>

<p>"Did he expect Mr. Lemby?"</p>

<p>"No, he didn't. He was quite surprised when he came unexpected,
as you might say. But he told me to show him into the drorin'-room,
and went up himself to have a chat."</p>

<p>"And the second visitor?'</p>

<p>"Oh, he expected him," said the witness, with emphasis, "for I
heard him say, friendly-like: 'Oh, you've come!' or something like
that. He took him into the study when he came, flying down the
stairs at the ring. Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Vence went on to repeat how she had been sent to the
kitchen to return later with cake and wine. Afterwards she related
what had occurred until the arrival of Hall and the escape of the
presumed criminal.</p>

<p>"Did you hear any noise of quarrelling while you were in the
kitchen?"</p>

<p>"No. I didn't. The kitchen's too far off."</p>

<p>The Coroner asked other questions, and received more or less
satisfactory answers, as Mrs. Vence seemed anxiously eager to be
frank. But, curiously enough, no mention was made of the missing
letter left by Hall. Either Purse had not told the Coroner about
this, or it had slipped his memory. Finally Mrs. Vence left the
witness-box to give place to Mr. Oliver Lemby.</p>

<p>He stated that he was a colonial from Australia, and had come to
England with his daughter three years ago. Having money, he had
taken his daughter into society, and there she had met the
deceased, who had proposed marriage. Witness frankly said that he
approved of the marriage, as Wyke was titled and wealthy, and, his
daughter, on these advantages being pointed out to her, was willing
enough to do what she was told. The marriage day was duly fixed,
and then Sir Hector, for no apparent reason, postponed the same and
came down to live at Hedgerton. Lemby stated how he had procured
the address from Edwin Craver, who had heard from his parents that
Wyke was staying in the parish, and related how he had come down on
the night of the murder to force Sir Hector to give an explanation.
The rest of his evidence was much the same as he had told
Purse.</p>

<p>"So that's all I know," said the witness, fiercely. "My address
is Tenby Mansions, Earl's Court, and you can find me there any
dashed time you like. I am not afraid."</p>

<p>"There is no reason that I can see why you should be afraid,"
said the Coroner, rather coldly. "You have given your evidence
frankly enough. But I ask you if you heard any noise or quarrelling
while you were in the drawing-room?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not. Had I done so I should have come down at once,
as I never object to being in a row."</p>

<p>"Did Sir Hector ever tell you that he was in danger of
death?"</p>

<p>"Never. I should have dashed well protected him had he said
that. I wanted him to marry my daughter, and not to die in this
infernal silly way."</p>

<p>Afterwards the postman gave his evidence, saying he had knocked
twice at the door of Maranatha, and that at the second knock the
door had suddenly been opened, then a man had dashed out to
disappear on the bicycle into the fog. He also said that he had
left the letter on the hall table; but the Coroner did not take
much notice of this statement, little thinking how important it
was.</p>

<p>Jervis followed, and related all that he knew, which mainly was
a repetition of what Sergeant Purse had said.</p>

<p>Then the doctor stepped into the witness-box. In his evidence he
said that a post-mortem examination had revealed the fact that
deceased had suffered from cancer.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Coroner, quickly, "that is a disease impossible
to cure. Do you think. Dr. Quin, that deceased may have taken his
own life on that account?"</p>

<p>"No," said the doctor, positively, "such a weak old man could
not have delivered so violent a blow. The knife was buried up to
the hilt in his heart, and had to pierce through a starched
shirt-front and a quilted jacket, both of which would have broken
the force of the blow. The body was clothed in a smoking-suit, if
you remember, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you don't think that Sir Hector committed suicide?"</p>

<p>"No. I am quite certain that he did not."</p>

<p>The final witness was the police officer who had arrived from
Waking. It appeared that the red bicycle had been found in the
stable of Jonas Sorley, who had come to the police-office to
confess this. Sorley was a carrier, and saw the advertisement about
the bicycle in the newspapers. Therefore, he had communicated with
the police. Sorley, being ill, could not come to the inquest, but
the officer brought his sworn deposition.</p>

<p>From this it appeared that on the night when the crime was
committed at Hedgerton Sorley was jogging along in his cart from
Bethley to Waking, some twenty miles away. When he left Bethley
there was no bicycle in his cart, but when he arrived at Waking
there was.</p>

<p>"The bicycle of Hall, the postman?" asked the Coroner.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It's the same number. But Sorley cannot say how the
bicycle came to be in his cart. It was nearly midnight when he
arrived at Waking."</p>

<p>This unsatisfactory statement completed the evidence, and there
was nothing for it but that the jury should bring in an open
verdict, which they accordingly did. Everyone agreed with this but
the buccaneer, who insisted to Sergeant Purse, when the proceedings
were over, that the escaped man was the assassin, and should be
directly accused.</p>

<p>"But we don't know his name, so how can a verdict be given
against him?" was the sergeant's reply. "An open verdict is
sufficient. We can search for the man, and when we find him we can
hang him."</p>

<p>"Yes, when you find him," jeered Lemby, contemptuously. "You'll
never find him!"</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_6" id=
"Chapter_6"></a>Chapter 6</b>
</h2>

<p>With the open verdict, the red bicycle case, as it was called,
ended for the time being, as no new evidence was forthcoming likely
to elucidate the problem. Wyke's assassin had suddenly emerged out
of the mists to commit the crime, and had as suddenly vanished into
them again. In spite of all efforts it was impossible for the
police authorities to find him.</p>

<p>Some society papers gave many details regarding the life of the
dead baronet, but stated nothing of any moment. Sir Hector had a
good income and a good position, apparently being a harmless old
trifler, who idled luxuriously day after day. He had no relations,
therefore the title became extinct, while the property&mdash;so
said the newspapers&mdash;lapsed to the Crown. For a time the old
dandy was missed in certain circles, but, as usual, was speedily
forgotten. Even the hinted romance of Miss Lemby being engaged
against her will to Wyke ceased to interest people, and the girl
herself was very glad that this should be the case.</p>

<p>At Hedgerton the sensation lasted longer. But when Mrs. Vence
departed bag and baggage, when Sergeant Purse took his leave, and
Lemby returned to London, the excitement gradually died away.
Maranatha was again placed in the hands of old Pedder as caretaker,
and again was advertised to let furnished.</p>

<p>When Christmas was over and the New Year dawned, Oliver Lemby
proposed to his daughter that they should return to the Antipodes.
The buccaneer was now weary of the restraints of civilisation, and
having failed to marry Claudia to a titled husband, desired to go
back to his old free life. Father and daughter discussed the matter
in the drawing-room of their Tenby Mansion flat, and quarrelled
openly. This was scarcely to be wondered at, as Lemby had a violent
temper, while Claudia was not the girl likely to submit to being
bullied. The pirate was half annoyed and half pleased by her
opposition.</p>

<p>"You're a chip of the old block, my girl," he said, smoking
furiously, "and can hold your dashed own with anyone; but you ain't
going to hold it with me."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll listen to sense, dad," said Claudia, coolly.</p>

<p>"That's so," Lemby assured her, in quite a dry American style;
"but then you ain't talking sense. What's the use of staying longer
in this worn-out country when you can't get a husband."</p>

<p>"I've got a husband," declared the girl, equably.</p>

<p>"I take your meaning. But the husband you've spotted ain't got
no handle to his name. That Craver chap you mean, don't you? Not
much. Rank and riches for you, Claudia, and if you don't hook them,
back you go with me to the South Seas."</p>

<p>"I won't," said Claudia, firmly. "Go yourself, dad, and leave me
here."</p>

<p>Lemby, lounging in a deep chair with a pipe between his teeth
and a glass of whisky at his elbow, stared at her with half-closed
eyes. He privately decided that she was much too handsome to be
allowed to throw herself away in a hurry. Claudia had a fine
figure, hair like sunshine, and laughing azure eyes, together with
a perfect complexion, very red lips, and the whitest of teeth. She
was tall and largely made, most imposing in her looks, and carried
herself so haughtily that the stately Roman name suited her
exactly. If Lemby was not a gentleman, his daughter was
emphatically a lady, for race showed itself plainly in her slender
hands and feet, as in her finely-cut features. From her father she
inherited her large frame and shapely body, while her ripe beauty
came from her mother. The buccaneer had captured a gentlewoman, who
was lured into marriage by his dare-devil looks. But for many years
he had been a widower.</p>

<p>"It was a mighty pity Wyke died," said Lemby, regretfully, and
ignoring his daughter's defiance. "He had a title, five thousand a
year, and a fine house in Devonshire, besides a position in
society. I reckon you'd have fitted the position first-class,
Claudia. Blamed bad luck, I call it, his pegging out under the
knife."</p>

<p>"Well, dad, he's dead, so there's no more to be said," said the
girl, impatiently.</p>

<p>"There's a heap more to be said, my dear. No one gets the title,
I guess, as the old man had no relatives. But the cash,
Claudia?"</p>

<p>"I saw in some society paper that it goes to the Crown," said
Claudia, carelessly, for she was young enough to care little for
money, never having felt the need of it.</p>

<p>"I ain't so sure of that," muttered her father, slowly drinking
the whisky to inspire him; "the old man was so much in love with
you that he told me he intended to leave you the dibs."</p>

<p>"If I married him, I suppose&mdash;not otherwise."</p>

<p>"That ain't certain, my girl. You were willing to marry him,
so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wasn't!" she flashed out, sharply. "You forced me."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I force you? You are my daughter, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I'm not your slave. I didn't want to be Lady
Wyke."</p>

<p>"No. You wish to be Mrs. Edwin Craver, and I'll jolly well see
as you don't. Seems to me, Claudia, that it would be only fair for
him to leave you his pile."</p>

<p>"Didn't he give you an explanation when you called?"</p>

<p>"No. I told you before that he didn't. Said as he'd come back to
the drawing-room to clear things up, and naturally didn't when he
pegged out in the study below. Anyhow, it's on the cards as he
might have made a will in your favour. And," added the buccaneer,
emphatically, "I'm dashed well determined to see the sharp as
handles his business."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sandal, in Lincoln's Inn Fields?"</p>

<p>"That's him. Wyke told you as he told me about Sandal when he
mentioned that marriage settlements were to be drawn up. I guess
I'll look him up to see if the old man did the right thing by you.
It's dashed queer as he should have postponed the marriage when he
worshipped the blamed ground you walked on, Claudia, my girl."</p>

<p>"It is strange; it was strange," admitted Claudia, pondering. "I
can't understand it myself, although I am glad that he acted as he
did. Perhaps, knowing that I loved Edwin, he changed his mind about
making me his miserable wife."</p>

<p>"Miserable!" jeered the pirate, contemptuously. "Miserable with
a title and five thousand a year. Shucks! my girl, you're talking
through your hat. Well, I reckon I'll see Sandal, and learn if
there's a will in your favour."</p>

<p>"I don't want Sir Hector's money," said Claudia, setting her
mouth obstinately. "I don't accept a penny of his money, will or no
will."</p>

<p>"Then I'll accept it for you," said Lemby, coolly, and heaved
his big body out of the chair. "We can't live on nothing, can
we?"</p>

<p>Claudia turned sharply from the window, out of which she was
looking. "Live on nothing?" she repeated, blankly, for the words
conveyed no sense to her.</p>

<p>"That's it, my girl." Lemby stretched himself with a yawn. "My
pile never was a big one. It's time for us to get back to the Sunny
South and make dollars, failing the old man's cash dropping
in."</p>

<p>"But I thought we were rich," expostulated Claudia, in dismay.
"If not, why did we come to England to live in so expensive a
style?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I wanted to do the right thing by you, my girl," said the
pirate, truculently. "I saw as you were a high-stepper when I
looked you up at that blamed school in Sydney. I had enough to give
us a few years of luxury, so I yanked you home to snatch a husband
of the sort I wanted."</p>

<p>"In plain English," cried Claudia, turning very red, and
clenching her hands as she faced her father, "you took me into the
slave-market; to sell me to the highest bidder?"</p>

<p>"Shucks!" said Lemby, uneasily, for Claudia had a whirlwind
temper, which was rising rapidly.</p>

<p>"It's not shucks, or anything like shucks," she retorted,
stamping her foot. "I don't recognise your right to choose mv
husband. I am a human being as well as your daughter, and I intend
to arrange my life for myself."</p>

<p>"What about the ten commandments?" sneered Lemby, hedging.
"'Children, obey your parents,' ain't it?"</p>

<p>"'Parents, respect your children,'" counter-quoted the girl.
"And how can I respect you, dad, when you tried to force me into a
disagreeable marriage. Like a fool, I allowed you to bully me into
promising to marry Sir Hector. But now that he is dead and buried I
shall act as I please."</p>

<p>"I shan't let you."</p>

<p>"I shan't ask you to let me. See here, dad, it's time we
understood one another, as you are going the wrong way to work with
me. Have you any money?"</p>

<p>"Enough to get back first-class to Australia with a few dollars
to see the year out. And I guess I can raise enough in Sydney to
hire a schooner and to take up the copra business again. If I stay
here I can't get along anyhow. It depends if Wyke left you the
dibs."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he has left me any dibs, as you call it," said
Claudia, who was now very pale, for the revelation had startled her
considerably. "Can't you leave me enough to live on for six months?
I can get a situation as a governess until Edwin is rich enough to
marry me."</p>

<p>"He shan't marry you," declared Lemby, looking fierce. "Craver's
only a manager in that blamed motor-car factory. He ain't even a
partner."</p>

<p>"He will be a partner one day when he gets money to put into the
firm," said the girl in a low voice and keeping her temper well in
hand.</p>

<p>"And where's he going to get the cash? His father's just a
blamed sky-pilot in a dashed township, the place where Wyke handed
in his cheques. Craver will never be rich, and will never have a
title, so he don't marry you."</p>

<p>She clenched her hands, hardened her face, and stepped up to her
tyrannical parent looking just as fierce as he did. "I don't want a
title, and I don't want money," she said, passionately. "I want to
marry the man I love, and Edwin is that man. I intend to become his
wife, in spite of you."</p>

<p>"You just try it, that's all."</p>

<p>"I intend to try. I have begun to try."</p>

<p>"You'll obey me."</p>

<p>"I shan't. I'll obey my conscience."</p>

<p>"I'll twist your neck, dash you!" roared the buccaneer,
infuriated by this opposition, which he quite expected.</p>

<p>"Oh, no you won't!" Claudia slipped aside, as he lunged forward,
and placed the breadth of the room between them. "You were always a
bully father, and are just the kind of slave-driver who should be
in the forecastle of a tramp steamer. But you don't bully me. I'll
die first. So there," and she stamped.</p>

<p>"Dashed spitfire, you are," he growled. "Have it your own silly
way. But you don't marry that engineer bounder, mind."</p>

<p>"Edwin is not a bounder!" cried Claudia, indignantly. "He's a
bred-and-born gentleman. While I," she added, bitingly, "I am your
daughter."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;" Lemby began to laugh good-humouredly&mdash;"I see
what you're getting at, my girl. No, I ain't a gilded Lord, for
sure, and never pretended to be. I'm just plain Oliver Lemby, as
deals square by them as deals square with him. But your mother was
a lady, Claudia, so your blood ain't all mud, remember."</p>

<p>"Why don't you remember, dad," she retorted, angrily, "and treat
me with some sort of respect? I know you're kind-hearted, and mean
well: but your manners are awful. Be civil."</p>

<p>"I am civil&mdash;as civil as I need be to my own daughter."</p>

<p>"Because I am your daughter, that's no reason why I should be
bullied. But it's no use talking, dada," she ended wearily, "you'll
never understand."</p>

<p>"I understand this&mdash;that I'm going to move heaven and earth
to get that cash of Wyke's which ought to come to you," said Lemby,
sullenly; "and whether I get it or not, I've got to get out of this
country, and you too."</p>

<p>"Why have you to get out?" asked Claudia, stuck by the queer
expression on her father's florid face.</p>

<p>Lemby shuffled and twisted, evading a direct answer. "I ain't
got any dibs, for one thing. I told you so."</p>

<p>"But if you get this money of Sir Hector's?" asked the girl,
trying to arrive at his meaning, for she saw that there was
something behind his speech.</p>

<p>"I'll go, all the same." Lemby looked at the carpet and
scowled.</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Because I choose to. That's why," he burst out furiously.</p>

<p>"Now, dad&mdash;" Claudia held up a warning hand "&mdash;we have
had one scene, so don't let us have another. You won't succeed in
getting your way with me."</p>

<p>"You are an ungrateful minx!"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;" Claudia sat down with a careless shrug "&mdash;call me as
many names as you like. That matters little. But don't go too
far."</p>

<p>"What will you do if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you go too far," interrupted the girl, her breast heaving
with passion, and her eyes flashing, "I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll leave this flat and go out to find a situation."</p>

<p>"Nobody will take you," said Lemby, uneasily, for he knew, what
she was capable of when her temper was aroused, as it certainly was
at present.</p>

<p>"That's my business, dad."</p>

<p>The buccaneer walked towards the door, halted there
irresolutely, and then looked round the room cautiously. After a
long pause, he stole forward lightly to bend down and whisper in
his daughter's ear. "If you don't come with me and light out
straight, you'll see me in trouble."</p>

<p>"What kind of trouble asked Claudia, shrinking back.</p>

<p>"Trouble of the worst. I've risked a lot to get that cash of Sir
Hector's."</p>

<p>"Risked what?" Claudia shivered and faltered.</p>

<p>"My good name, my liberty, my life."</p>

<p>"Dad!" She sprang up with a cry.</p>

<p>"My life," repeated Lemby, emphatically, and walked out of the
room.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_7" id=
"Chapter_7"></a>Chapter 7</b>
</h2>

<p>When her father left the room after giving his ominous hint, the
girl threw herself full-length on the sofa and covered her
face.</p>

<p>In a frank manner Lemby had stated that he wanted money, and
that he had risked much to obtain the same. His reference to the
chance of losing good name, liberty, and life, could only mean that
he was in some way concerned in the Hedgerton crime. Claudia knew
that he had gone down to see Sir Hector and to demand an
explanation&mdash;she knew that he had actually been in the house
when the death took place. Certainly, on the face of it, he was
exonerated by the evidence of the policeman and the housekeeper;
yet it now appeared that he was less innocent than was supposed.
The girl did not dare to think that he was the guilty person, for,
rough as were his manners, she could not believe that he would so
callously slay an old and feeble man. Still, in a moment of
impatience he might have had something to do with the sinister
affair. His own words hinted as much, and he had said just enough
to make Claudia long for her own peace of mind to know more. The
girl, with her face buried in the sofa-cushion, raged silently and
strongly.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a touch on her shoulder brought her to her feet with a
loud scream, and she quite startled the person who had thus aroused
her. He was a tall and handsome young man, with closely-cropped,
brown hair, a clean-shaven face, and shrewd eyes of hazel, merry
and bright, but now he looked quite dismayed at the dishevelled
aspect of the girl. "My dearest Claudia, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Edwin!" At the sound if his kind voice she broke down
altogether, and in a moment she burst into tears. "Oh, Edwin!" That
was all she could gasp out as she threw herself into his arms.</p>

<p>"My dear! My dear!" Craver sat down on the sofa and gently drew
the girl on to his knee to soothe her. "What is the matter? There!
there! Don't speak. Let me get you a glass of water."</p>

<p>"No," sobbed Claudia, hastily drying her eyes. "I'm behaving
like a fool. I'll feel better in a few minutes. But hold me
tightly, Edwin. Let me feel that I have someone who loves me."</p>

<p>Without a word the young man petted her and calmed her, and
gradually restored her to reason. Claudia's sobs grew less violent,
her limbs ceased to tremble, and shortly she slipped out of her
lover's arms to stand up. "I am silly," she confessed, and walked
across the room to look at her disorder in a mirror over the
fireplace. "You beast!" said Claudia, staring at her red eyes and
tumbled hair. "Why can't you behave," and she stamped
viciously.</p>

<p>Craver rose and moved gently behind her to lay his arm across
her shoulder with a smile. Claudia appreciated the diplomatic way
in which he was dealing with her, and now that she was more
composed turned to face him squarely and take his two hands within
her own.</p>

<p>"My dear," cried Claudia, bending forward to kiss him, "you
always do me good."</p>

<p>"I'm glad." Edwin returned the kiss with interest. "But what is
the matter?"</p>

<p>"Dad's the matter. He always is the matter, I don't mind his
raging, I am quite used to that, and he really can't help it. But
when he says&mdash;" She hesitated.</p>

<p>"Says what?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you just now, as it upset me altogether. Wait for
a time, Edwin, and let us talk all round the shop. Then I can
gradually lead up to what he said. Oh, it's awful!"</p>

<p>"It must be," rejoined Craver, with a perplexed look, "to upset
you so much. I know you are not an hysterical girl, Claudia. Come
and sit down, so that we can talk at our ease, and, you can give me
some tea in half an hour. I'm dying of thirst."</p>

<p>"You shall have some tea now, or you may die," said Claudia in a
lively tone, and touching the bell. "Luckily father has gone out,
and will not be back for a long time. We'll be all alone."</p>

<p>"That will be Paradise," said Craver, gaily, and dropped into
the deep armchair, lately occupied by the pirate; while Claudia
gave orders to the neat maid-servant who appeared. "Come and sit
down, dear."</p>

<p>"In this chair," replied Claudia, seating herself opposite to
him, and placing a light bamboo table between them. "We must be
sensible."</p>

<p>"I get so much sense in business," sighed the young man, "that I
come here to indulge in a little delicious folly. Do you feel
better, darling?" and he leant his elbows on the table to touch her
hand.</p>

<p>"Much better. You have given me strength, which I needed. And
you are so very strong, Edwin. Much stronger than father, as you
don't waste your powers in boasting and swanking."</p>

<p>"My dearest girl, you must not talk of your father in that
way."</p>

<p>"What is the use of blinking at facts?" retorted Claudia, with a
pretty shrug. "I love dad, who is kind to me after his truculent
fashion. But he really does swank, as you know. Admit it at once,
sir."</p>

<p>"I admit it right enough. But he's a real good sort, you know,
Claudia."</p>

<p>"So long as he gets his own way he's a good sort," retorted the
girl, sharply; "but it never strikes him that I want my own way
sometimes."</p>

<p>"As how?"</p>

<p>"I want to marry you."</p>

<p>"Well, now that poor old Wyke is dead, that's all settled, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Not so far as dad is concerned. He wants me to marry money. I
was weak enough to give in to him over Sir Hector, but now I have
to fight, for my freedom, and you must help me."</p>

<p>Craver looked rather grim and very determined. "Oh, I'll do
that. No one marries you but me. You never would have become
engaged to Wyke had you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Had I really and truly loved you," finished Claudia swiftly. "I
know quite well what you mean, Edwin. But you have never lived with
my dad. He would wear out the Archangel Gabriel to get his own way.
I fought and fought till I could fight no longer. Then I gave in.
But fate has now cut the knot, and I'll see that it isn't tied
again."</p>

<p>"Your father will worry you, of course?"</p>

<p>"He's certain to. But I'll run away and become a governess. Oh,
here's Jane." She swept some papers off the bamboo table and helped
to lay the cloth and adjust the tea-things. "Thank you, Jane. I
shan't want anything more."</p>

<p>"I don't like the idea of your being a governess," said Edwin,
who had been carefully considering the proposition while the
parlourmaid was present, and argued about it now that she was gone.
"You are too handsome to be a governess."</p>

<p>"And not clever enough, you might add," retorted Claudia,
pouring out the tea; "but I must do something. Dad worries and
worries and worries. He wants to return to the South Seas to make
more money, and insists that I shall go with him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Claudia!" Craver dropped the piece of bread and butter he
had picked up. "Oh, Claudia!"</p>

<p>"It's all very well saying, 'Oh, Claudia'; but facts have to be
faced. And very uncomfortable facts, too, now that I am coming to
them."</p>

<p>"Coming to what?"</p>

<p>"To the facts which upset me," Claudia pushed back her chair,
and leant her elbow on her knee and her chin on her hand. "Edwin,
what do you know about this dreadful murder of Sir Hector?"</p>

<p>Craver started so violently that he spilt his tea and had to set
the cup down in a hurry. "Good heavens, Claudia, what do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"What I say. I speak plainly enough don't I?"</p>

<p>"What should I know about the murder except what I read in the
newspapers?" was Craver's reluctant reply. "Because it took place
in my father's parish that does not mean my having anything to do
with it."</p>

<p>"I never suggested your having," said Claudia, in a cross tone.
"How you do jump to conclusions. But dad was in the house when Sir
Hector was killed."</p>

<p>"Yes. Upstairs in the drawing-room. He came down
when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When the crime was committed. Mrs. Vence and the policeman said
that Sir Hector was dead before dad appeared in the study."</p>

<p>"Yes. So I read in the report of the inquest proceedings.
Well?"</p>

<p>"Well if that is the case dad is innocent."</p>

<p>Craver stared. When Claudia first broached the unpleasant
subject he had turned pale, but now the colour was slowly creeping
back into his sunburnt face. "Of course, Mr. Lemby is innocent," he
said, after a pause. "There never was any question of his having
anything to do with the death."</p>

<p>"Sir Hector was rich," said Claudia, in apparently an irrelevant
manner.</p>

<p>Craver nodded, wondering what she meant. "Five thousand a year
according to the gossip of the newspapers."</p>

<p>"Well," continued the girl, "dad is poor, and wants money. He
hoped to get it by making me marry Sir Hector. But as I did not
become Lady and as I never can be owing to the death, dad is in a
hole."</p>

<p>"My dear Claudia, I really don't know what you mean?"</p>

<p>"I'm just coming to the point now," said the girl, nervously,
and her lips quivered. "You know that dad went down to ask Sir
Hector why he had postponed the marriage?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Did he receive an explanation?"</p>

<p>"No. Sir Hector was about to give him one when the ring came at
the door, and Sir Hector went down to see the man who murdered
him."</p>

<p>"He might not have murdered him," murmured Craver looking down
at his cup.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Why should he have fled if he was innocent?" said
Claudia, hurriedly. "But let that pass, Edwin. The point is that
dad did not get an explanation; but somehow he has got it into his
head that Sir Hector may have left me the money by will."</p>

<p>"On what grounds does he believe that?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you. He did not say. But to-day he has gone to see
Mr. Sandal in Lincoln's Inn Field, who is Sir Hector's lawyer. And
when he left this very room." continued Claudia, sinking her voice
to a frightened whisper, "he said that he had risked his
reputation, his liberty, and his life to get money."</p>

<p>Craver looked hard at the girl, and seemed to be about as
nervous as she was herself. "Did he say that, he had risked so much
to get this particular money of Sir Hector's?"</p>

<p>"No. But he more or less implied it."</p>

<p>"And you took it to mean that he had killed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No." Claudia leapt to her feet with a look of positive terror
on her face, so greatly was she moved. "Don't say it. It's
impossible. Dad is rough and fierce but he would never kill a
feeble old man like Sir Hector. Besides, there was no reason why he
should, as when I married Sir Hector the money would have come to
me as the wife while he lived and afterwards the widow. And what I
had I should, of course, share with dad."</p>

<p>"You forget," remarked Craver politely, "that as the marriage
was postponed there was every chance that it might not take
place."</p>

<p>Claudia's nostrils dilated and her bosom heaved. "Are you
against dad?" she asked sharply. "If you are, I wish you had let me
know. Then I could have held my tongue."</p>

<p>"I am not against your father," said Craver, steadily; "but I
wish to place all points before you. I do not believe Mr. Lemby is
guilty, although his sayings are dark and ominous."</p>

<p>"They upset me altogether!" cried the girl, restlessly.
"Therefore, Edwin, until you find out who stabbed Sir Hector, we
cannot marry."</p>

<p>"Claudia!" He was dismayed by this speech.</p>

<p>"I mean it!" she declared, waving him back. "I shall never be
happy until the truth is known. Learn who murdered Sir Hector, and
exonerate my dad."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best, although you set me a hard task. But this
money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded the girl, seeing how nervous her lover was.</p>

<p>Craver moved slowly towards the door. "You will never get it.
Nor will your father. Sir Hector did not leave his fortune to
either of you."</p>

<p>Claudia stared when her lover disappeared. She wondered if he
knew more about the crime than he admitted. Her father, her
lover&mdash;was one or the other guilty?</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_8" id=
"Chapter_8"></a>Chapter 8</b>
</h2>

<p>When in the street, Craver turned over in his mind what the girl
had said relative to the hint given by her father. Undoubtedly
Lemby had a superlatively bad temper, and undoubtedly he had been
in the house when the crime was committed. Adding to this the fact
that Wyke disliked Claudia's father and had a bitter tongue, it did
not seem impossible that the pirate might have struck the blow in a
moment of anger. Before the arrival of the postman, and while Mrs.
Vence was in the kitchen, Lemby might have slipped down from the
upstairs drawing-room to commit the crime and then have slipped up
again. But against this was to be placed the fact that a second
visitor was not only in the house, but in the company of the
baronet. Lemby could scarcely have used the knife while the other
man was present. On the whole, Craver was perplexed by the
situation, and wondered what he should do. If Lemby took his
daughter to Australia, Craver felt sure that he would never see her
again, as he himself was unable to leave England. And Lemby, if
implicated in the death of his proposed son-in-law, would certainly
return to his native land to escape possible arrest. For quite ten
minutes Craver stood by the Underground Station at Earl's Court
considering how to act. Finally, he made up his mind as to his next
step, and took a ticket to Blackfriars.</p>

<p>When in the train the young man reflected on the conclusion he
had arrived at. This was to follow Lemby to Mr. Sandal's office,
and frankly offer his assistance in extricating the pirate from his
dilemma on condition that Claudia should be allowed to marry him.
It was difficult to see how he could help the pirate since he knew
so little. Two heads are always better than one, and Craver
believed that Lemby would consent to the marriage in order to gain
a friend while in trouble. Craver alighted on the Blackfriars
platform with the conviction that he was going on a wild-goose
chase. Nevertheless, failing all else, he believed it was worth
while to act as he intended.</p>

<p>Edwin knew where Mr. Sandal's office was situated, as Sir Hector
had mentioned on a momentous occasion the name and address of his
lawyer. So the young man walked up to the Strand, and soon found
himself in Lincoln's Inn Fields. In a few minutes he was at the
door of the building in which Mr. Sandal's office was situated, and
was mounting the stairs. On inquiry it appeared that Lemby had
arrived, and was awaiting the interview with Mr. Sandal, who was
engaged for the time being. Craver rejoiced that there was a chance
of seeing the pirate before he interviewed the lawyer, and
requested to be shown into the waiting-room. The clerk opened a
side door to admit him into the same, and then closed it again.
Seated near a table covered with magazines and newspapers for the
convenience of waiting clients was Lemby reading one of the
newspapers. He raised his eyes when the door opened, and rose to
his foot when he saw Craver. The astonishment of the buccaneer was
very apparent.</p>

<p>"What on earth are you doing here, Craver?" he asked in his
truculent way. "I did not know that Sandal was your lawyer?"</p>

<p>"Nor is he," replied Craver, taking a seat and thus forcing
Lemby to resume his former position. "I came here to see you."</p>

<p>"Oh, did you? And who told you that I was here?"</p>

<p>"Claudia."</p>

<p>"Miss Lemby to you, Craver," said the pirate, gruffly. "I
suppose you slipped in to see my daughter immediately my back was
turned. A nice way of behaving, I must say."</p>

<p>"I am behaving in a perfectly honourable way," retorted Craver,
much nettled.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think so, dash you! I refuse to allow you to make
love to Claudia, as I don't intend you shall marry her. I told you
so before."</p>

<p>"You did, while Sir Hector was alive. Now that he is dead there
is no reason why I should not marry your daughter."</p>

<p>"There is every reason, and one confoundedly strong one."
snarled Lemby, glaring furiously. "You have no money. When Wyke was
alive I told you to keep away from my flat, and now that he is dead
you might have had the decency to do what I asked you to do."</p>

<p>"See here, Mr. Lemby." said Craver, steadily. "I love Claudia,
and I intend to marry her. She yielded to your pressing wishes and
became engaged to marry Sir Hector. He is dead now, and I intend to
have my innings."</p>

<p>"Like your dashed impertinence to think so!"</p>

<p>"Speeches of that kind won't turn me from my resolution, Mr.
Lemby," said the young man, coldly.</p>

<p>Lemby appeared confused for the moment, and cast down his eyes.
"I won't have it," he declared with a growl. "Claudia's my
daughter, and she shall marry whom I choose."</p>

<p>"She won't. She shall marry me. It is about that matter I have
come to see you, Mr. Lemby."</p>

<p>"Oh, have you? And do you think that I am going to be spied upon
and followed and worried and chased? Well, you are mistaken. Clear
out, and mind your own dashed business."</p>

<p>Lemby was on the point of losing his temper, according to his
usual fashion; but Craver did not mind. The hotter Lemby got the
cooler was the young man, and the more composed was his speech. "I
have come to see after your business, Mr. Lemby," he said,
significantly.</p>

<p>"I shan't allow you to meddle with that," snapped the angry
pirate.</p>

<p>"It is better that I should meddle with it than that the
police&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;" Lemby jumped up in a violent hurry "&mdash;drop it!
You are going too far, Craver. What the deuce have the police to do
with me?"</p>

<p>"This much. They want to know exactly what took place at
Maranatha while you were in the house."</p>

<p>Lemby winced but still kept up his defiance. "I told all that I
knew at the inquest," he blustered, "and Sergeant Purse was quite
satisfied."</p>

<p>"Ah, so you think," hinted Craver, bluffing boldly; "but he may
have his suspicious of you. If he takes action&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Takes action." Lemby rose up, and sat down with a positive look
of terror on his face. "I don't know what you mean," he ended,
doggedly.</p>

<p>"I mean that you want money, and that you risked reputation,
liberty and life to, get it." Craver looked significantly at his
proposed father-in-law.</p>

<p>Lemby recognised his own speech to Claudia. "You have been
listening to the conversation between me and my daughter," he said,
fiercely.</p>

<p>"No, I have not. But after you left the flat I saw Claudia, and
she sought my counsel."</p>

<p>"It's none of your business, Craver, and Claudia is a minx for
talking to you about my affairs."</p>

<p>"It is my business," insisted the young man, firmly. "I hear
that you want Claudia to go with you to Australia, and I don't
intend her to go."</p>

<p>"Oh! don't you," sneered the other, "And how do you intend to
stop her going?"</p>

<p>"Ah! that remains to be seen."</p>

<p>"You're a confounded scoundrel!"</p>

<p>"Gently, Mr. Lemby," said Edwin, resolutely, keeping his temper.
"If I were what you call me, I could easily stop your projected
journey to Australia by informing Sergeant Purse what you said to
Claudia. But I don't intend to do that. I followed you here as your
friend to offer my services."</p>

<p>"I don't want them," vociferated the pirate, looking uneasy.</p>

<p>"Think again, Mr. Lemby. You are in a difficult position, and
notwithstanding your frankness at the inquest, Sergeant Purse may
have suspicions that you did not reveal all. You need a friend, and
I am willing to be that friend."</p>

<p>"At a price, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Naturally. I wish you to consent to my marriage with Claudia if
I succeed in getting you out of this trouble."</p>

<p>Lemby rose again, and began to walk up and down the room like a
caged beast. "I am in no trouble," he raged fiercely.</p>

<p>"No, not now; but you may be. And your words to Claudia hint
that you expect some sort of trouble."</p>

<p>"She had no right to speak to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think she had," rejoined Craver, equably. "Claudia knows
that I love her and am her true friend. You have caused her much
distress by your hints that you are in danger, so it is right that
she should seek comfort from me. And as you are her father, it is
not likely that I will jeopardise your freedom."</p>

<p>"I am in no danger of losing my freedom," was the angry
reply.</p>

<p>"Then why did you use those words to Claudia?"</p>

<p>"To make her do what I want."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Lemby&mdash;" Edwin rose with an air of
finality "&mdash;you know your own business best. I came here to
offer my services on condition that you allow me to marry your
daughter. But as you refuse to listen to sense you must be content
to risk the suspicions of Purse. I apologise for having troubled
you."</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;" Lemby stopped the young man as he moved towards the
door "&mdash;don't be in a hurry. I expect to see Mr. Sandal every
moment, but we can talk for a few minutes. Are you honest?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I, am, and you know that I am."</p>

<p>"Well, then, leave matters as they are for a day or so until we
can have a long and exhaustive talk. I have come here to see if
Wyke has left his money to Claudia, which he should do, considering
how badly he treated her. If he has acted fairly and squarely
Claudia and I will be in clover; if not, I may require your
assistance."</p>

<p>"I am willing to give it if you will promise to remain in
England."</p>

<p>"For the time being I shall remain," said the pirate,
grudgingly. "I have no reason to run away in spite of my speech to
my daughter of which you have made such clever use, dash you."</p>

<p>"Then I take it that you have nothing to do with the
murder?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you can take it that way; I am perfectly innocent."</p>

<p>"Then why do you accept my assistance?" asked Edwin, calmly.</p>

<p>"I shall explain that when we have our talk later. Meanwhile, as
I have to see Sandal and arrange about the money, perhaps you will
clear out. It is necessary for me to think over matters before
interviewing the sharp."</p>

<p>"I should have thought you would have arranged matters by this
time," commented Craver, sarcastically. "However. I will go.
Remember you have promised to remain in London for the time
being."</p>

<p>"Yes," growled Lemby, savagely, "you've got the whip-hand of
me."</p>

<p>"If you mean that I am likely to use the information supplied by
Claudia, to prevent your leaving, Mr. Lemby, I have not got the
whip-hand of you. I am not so mean as to employ tactics of a
dishonourable nature. All I say is that if you will stay in England
I am willing to help you in every way."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll leave it at that," said Lemby, ungraciously. "But,
mind, I don't say that you will marry Claudia."</p>

<p>"I am content to wait," replied Craver, coolly, and passed
through the door of the waiting-room at the same moment that a
clerk opened it to say that Mr. Sandal was ready to see Mr. Oliver
Lemby.</p>

<p>The lawyer was a tall, thin, dried-up man, with a clean-shaven
face and two shrewd, twinkling black eyes. He had met Lemby before
in connection with the marriage settlements of Claudia, and did not
like him. Therefore Sandal received him coldly, and, having seated
himself at his desk, waited to hear what he had called about.
Lemby, by no means disconcerted by this chilly reception, plunged
at once into the matter. And, being nervous, he was the more
truculent.</p>

<p>"This is a pretty kettle of fish," he said, in his gruff
way.</p>

<p>"If you are referring to the sad death of Sir Hector Wyke," said
Sandal, in his dry, precise style, "it is a very painful
matter."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come down to Hedgerton to look into the affair?"
asked Lemby. "Don't you know that I wrote to you?"</p>

<p>"I received your letter, Mr. Lemby; there was no need for me to
go down personally. I sent a representative, who saw Sergeant
Purse, and did what was required. My representative was at the
inquest, at the burial, and at the police-office in Redleigh, where
he learnt that no trace could be found of the assassin. But you,
Mr. Lemby," added the lawyer pointedly, "were in the house when my
late client was murdered. Have you come to tell me something likely
to lead to the detection of the criminal?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I haven't. I am as much in the dark as you are about
the matter."</p>

<p>"Then I fail to understand why you have come to see me," said
Sandal, coldly.</p>

<p>"Why?" Lemby grew angry. "I want to know what Sir Hector has
done for my daughter."</p>

<p>"Nothing." Sandal raised his eyebrows. "Why should he do
anything."</p>

<p>"My daughter was engaged to marry him, and the marriage
settlements were drawn up by you."</p>

<p>"But they were not signed by Sir Hector," Sandal reminded him:
"nor did the marriage take place. Well?"</p>

<p>"Well," echoed the pirate, viciously. "Surely Sir Hector has
provided for my daughter in his will."</p>

<p>"No, he has not. There is a will dated many years ago, before
Sir Hector met your daughter. That will leaves all the property,
real and personal, to quite another person."</p>

<p>"Who to?" asked Lemby, rather ungrammatically.</p>

<p>"To Sir Hector's wife."</p>

<p>"What!" Lemby rose with a dazed air, scarcely believing his
ears.</p>

<p>"To his wife. To Lady Wyke." The lawyer smiled grimly.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_9" id=
"Chapter_9"></a>Chapter 9</b>
</h2>

<p>Having in his adventurous life become accustomed to unexpected
surprises, Lemby was rarely startled, and frequently boasted that
nothing could astonish him. But on this occasion he was not only
astonished but enraged. At the outset he blankly refused to believe
the lawyer.</p>

<p>"You are talking nonsense," he declared, roughly. "How could
Wyke have a wife when he was engaged to be married to my
daughter?"</p>

<p>"That is a fair question, which I shall endeavour to answer
fairly," replied Mr. Sandal, ignoring the crudity of speech. "Sir
Hector, it appears, was married some twenty years ago to an
actress. They did not get on well together, and parted by mutual
consent. Lady Wyke, under her stage name of Miss Maisie Chain, went
to America, and, after a long silence, news came to Sir Hector that
she had perished in a theatre fire at Chicago. He quite believed
that he was a widower, and therefore felt himself at liberty to
propose to Miss Lemby."</p>

<p>"It's all nonsense," repeated the pirate, furiously.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't wonder at your saying so," said Sandal, calmly.
"I was surprised myself when Lady Wyke turned up again. She has
altered little."</p>

<p>"Oh! So you have seen her before!"</p>

<p>"Yes. I have been Sir Hector's lawyer for many years, as we were
at school together and have always been friends. When he wished to
marry Miss Chain I tried to persuade him not to, but he was wilful,
and persisted in doing so. As I foretold, the match turned out to
be an unhappy one. When Sir Hector came to me with the news that
Lady Wyke was dead, I congratulated him on his release. She was a
very determined and trying woman."</p>

<p>Lemby clutched his head with both hands, leant his elbows on his
knees, and stared at the carpet. "You are telling me the truth, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Why, should I tell you a lie?" demanded Sandal, drily. "I wish
myself that Sir Hector could have married your daughter, who is a
sweet girl. She would have made him happy."</p>

<p>"How dare he make love to Claudia when he was already a married
man!"</p>

<p>"Let me remind you, Mr. Lemby, that when Sir Hector asked your
daughter to be his wife he was a widower, or, at least, believed
himself to be so."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't he tell me so?"</p>

<p>"There was no need to tell you. Sir Hector very naturally wished
to forget the mistake he had made with regard to his marriage."</p>

<p>"It's a plot to rob my daughter of her rights!" shouted Lemby,
savagely.</p>

<p>"Lower your voice, if you please," said Sandal, sternly. "If you
cannot speak quietly I shall put an end to this interview. There is
no plot. I have the newspaper in which is the report of the fire at
the Chicago theatre and the death of Maisie Chain, who was really
Lady Wyke. Sir Hector left that with me, and it has remained in his
deed box ever since. As to your daughter's rights, she had none,
seeing that she was not married to my client."</p>

<p>"Are you sure, that this woman is Lady Wyke?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. I knew her well in the old days, when Sir Hector and
I were young men. I was present at the marriage, and there is a
certificate of that in the deed box also. I knew Lady Wyke
immediately she walked into this office some days after her husband
was buried."</p>

<p>"How did she escape from the fire?" asked Lemby, sullenly, for
he felt that a fortune was slipping away from him.</p>

<p>"She was rescued, but owing to being stifled more or loss by the
smoke, it was reported that she had died. But being nursed
carefully she recovered, and remained quiet. Owing to the shock she
did not resume her stage career, so that is why neither Sir Hector
nor myself saw her name again. Had we done so, we should have known
that she was still living, and then Sir Hector, being an honourable
man, would not have courted your daughter."</p>

<p>"An honourable man!" snarled Lemby, who made no attempt to
contain his wrath. "Oh, yes, very honourable to leave my daughter
without a penny!"</p>

<p>"He had no reason to leave her anything," expostulated the
lawyer, mildly.</p>

<p>"Yes, he had. She was engaged to him, and he dodged the
marriage."</p>

<p>"He did so because Lady Wyke in America saw a statement in an
English society paper which was sent to her that Sir Hector
contemplated a second marriage. She came over to England at once
and let him know that she was alive. For that reason Sir Hector
postponed the marriage."</p>

<p>"Then you knew why he did so?" foamed Lemby, clenching his hands
and looking dangerously savage.</p>

<p>"Not at the time. I was amazed to hear that the marriage was
postponed, as I knew how deeply my old friend was in love with Miss
Lemby. Only when Lady Wyke came here after his burial did I learn
that her letter to him, saying she was alive, made him put off the
day of his marriage with Miss Lemby."</p>

<p>"When he learnt that this woman was alive he should have made
over a good income to my daughter, so as to recompense her for the
disappointment."</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you," said Sandal, "for Sir Hector had no
call to do what you suggest. And I don't think that your daughter
is disappointed, seeing that she never cared for Sir Hector, and
only yielded to your wish that, the marriage should take
place."</p>

<p>"That's a lie."</p>

<p>"It is not a lie. And I beg that you will not speak to me in
that way. Sir Hector told me himself that Miss Lemby was in love
with a young engineer calling himself Edwin Craver, and that it was
you who were compelling her to marry him. I pointed out to my
friend that as he had made one mistake it was foolish for him to
make a second, since Miss Lemby did not love him. But he was so
infatuated with her that he insisted upon getting his own way."</p>

<p>"He made a fool of my girl," said the visitor, sullenly.</p>

<p>"Indeed, he did not. His intentions were strictly honourable,
and he would have fulfilled them had not Lady Wyke made her
appearance."</p>

<p>"Seeing how things stood, Wyke; should have told me all about
them."</p>

<p>"I agree with you there. But he told no one, not even me. I knew
nothing until Lady Wyke walked into this office and explained
matters."</p>

<p>Lemby rose and stamped about the room. "It's all a lie! I don't
believe a word of what you say."</p>

<p>"Well, it is natural that you should have your doubts," rejoined
Sandal, coolly, and glanced at his watch. "But Lady Wyke will be
here in a few minutes, as I have to see her to-day in regard to the
property. Then she can tell you herself that what I say is
true."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll wait," snapped Lemby, and sat down again with a
determination to have it out with this undesirable woman, who had
risen from the dead to upset his selfish plans. "She sees you with
regard to the property?"</p>

<p>"Yes. By a will made shortly after his marriage Sir Hector left
all his property to his wife. That will has never been changed,
and, therefore, holds good."</p>

<p>Lemby contradicted. "Wyke told me that when he married Claudia
he intended to make a will leaving all his property to her."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said the solicitor, suavely. "And he would have done
so when he was married. But as the marriage did not take place,
there was no new will made."</p>

<p>"Wyke should have made the will before marriage."</p>

<p>Sandal laughed. "You are very ignorant of English law, Mr.
Lemby," he observed drily. "A will made before marriage is waste
paper when that marriage takes place. Until your daughter was Lady
Wyke no disposition of the property on the lines of marriage, save
in settlements, could have been made. Those settlements were drawn
up, but not signed, therefore they are useless. And now that Sir
Hector is dead the property goes to Lady Wyke by the only will
which is in existence."</p>

<p>"Cannot it be upset?"</p>

<p>"No. The will is sound in law. I drew it up myself. And
remember, Mr. Lemby, that in justice the widow of Sir Hector should
inherit the five thousand a year which he died possessed of."</p>

<p>Lemby scowled at the carpet and revolved schemes. He wanted the
money badly, as he was worse off than Claudia knew, even though he
had given her a hint of coming poverty. But he saw no means of
securing again what he had lost unless Lady Wyke was disposed to be
gracious, and recompensed Claudia for her presumed disappointment.
He therefore determined to wait and see if Lady Wyke was a person
whom he could manage. Possibly he might coax or bully her into what
he called justice. And it was at this stage of his meditations that
the wife of Sir Hector entered the room.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Mr. Sandal," said Lady Wyke, in a high, shrill voice,
hard and rather rasping in its tone. "I fear that I am late."</p>

<p>Mr. Sandal assured the newcomer that she was not late, and
placed a chair for her near his desk. Lemby rose in a lumpish,
ungracious fashion and glared at the fashionable little woman as
though he could have slain her with a look. She cast a careless
glance at him, looked him over from head to foot, and then glanced
inquiringly at the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Is there any reason why this gentleman should wait?" asked Lady
Wyke, and raised a lorgnette to her fine dark eyes to criticise the
pirate.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lemby will explain himself why he is here, Lady Wyke."</p>

<p>Mr. Lemby was in no hurry to explain himself. He stared
wolfishly at the woman who had put an end to his greedy hopes, and
did not speak, for quite two minutes. He noted that Lady Wyke was a
smallish woman, by no means in her first youth, with a slender
figure and a very perfect pink-and-white complexion, which was
probably due to art. Her features were cleanly cut, her teeth were
white and regular, and she had a pair of large dark eyes, which
suggested those of an Andalusian beauty. Nothing could have been
more fashionable or accurate than mourning.</p>

<p>Lemby, being a big man, liked little women, and could not
conceal from himself that Lady Wyke was particularly attractive.
Yet he judged from the hardness of her bright eyes and the
unemotional tones of her shrill voice that she was a cat. So he
called her in his own mind, and decided that only personal violence
could reduce her to reason, and to get the money by personal
violence was quite, what the buccaneer would do. He loathed Lady
Wyke as a marplot, yet he could not deny her attractions. At one
and the same time he would have liked to kiss her and to strangle
her.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Lemby," said Lady Wyke, sharply, for she objected to
his insolent scrutiny, "and why are you here?"</p>

<p>"To stand up for Claudia's rights," growled Lemby, in a surly
manner.</p>

<p>"Claudia? And who is Claudia?" She stared impertinently through
the lorgnette.</p>

<p>"My daughter, who would have married Sir Hector had you not been
alive."</p>

<p>Lady Wyke dropped her glasses and burst into a shrill,
unpleasant laugh. "Oh, I remember&mdash;" she clapped her
elegantly-gloved hands&mdash;"I saw the announcement of the
proposed marriage in a society paper which I picked up in New York,
and it was that which brought me over, to tell Hector that he must
not commit bigamy. Well, I'm sorry for your daughter, Mr. Lemby,
but I am Sir Hector Wyke's wife."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," put in Sandal, "you are his widow."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Lady Wyke, contemptuously. "How precise you
are."</p>

<p>"It is just as well to call things by their proper names," said
Sandal, grimly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm a thing am I! Don't you think he is very ungallant, Mr.
Lemby?"</p>

<p>"I don't think anything about it," snarled the pirate,
crossly.</p>

<p>Lady Wyke put up her lorgnette again. "No? You look as though
you acted rather than thought. I wonder if your daughter is like
you."</p>

<p>"No, she dashed well ain't."</p>

<p>"I thought not. My late husband was a fool, but he was always a
gentleman, and would not have cared to marry a girl who used oaths
and bad grammar.</p>

<p>"Claudia speaks as well as you do, and is much handsomer and
younger," retorted Lemby, spitefully.</p>

<p>"Really! You make me long to see this paragon. What is your
address, Mr. Lemby, as I should like to call," and Lady Wyke took
out a set of ivory tablets.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to call, nor does Claudia," growled Lemby, who
was exasperated the way in which the woman spoke.</p>

<p>"If you don't want to see me, why are you here, then?"</p>

<p>"I want justice done to my daughter. Wyke intended to marry her,
and settle money on her; and he's done neither."</p>

<p>"You can't expect a dead man to perform impossibilities, Mr.
Lemby." rejoined the widow sarcastically. "I understand what you
mean. If you will give me your address, I should call and talk the
matter over."</p>

<p>Lemby shook his head. "There's not much to be got out of
you."</p>

<p>"Dear me! how accurately you judge my character in five minutes.
However, I leave the matter to your own discretion. Give me your
address, and I shall pay a visit to see my rival and adjust
matters."</p>

<p>Lemby, in a grudging tone, supplied the required information,
which the widow noted down swiftly.</p>

<p>"That is all I want," she said, with a nod, as she replaced the
tablets in her pocket. "I shall call to-morrow or the next day, Mr.
Lemby, Good-afternoon."</p>

<p>Lemby rose and stood, fingering his silk hat like a schoolboy.
He felt abashed in the presence of this domineering little
woman.</p>

<p>She became impatient. "Don't stand there gawking. Go away.
Good-afternoon, Mr. Lemby," And without a word, Lemby shambled from
the room, snubbed into silence for once, in his life.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_10" id=
"Chapter_10"></a>Chapter 10</b>
</h2>

<p>A week went by and things remained as they were. Claudia
attended to her household duties, went shopping, and visited
friends, while her father smoked and ate and slept in somewhat
animal fashion. All his restlessness seemed to have departed since
the failure of his scheme to marry Claudia to Sir Hector, and he
was content to live a listless existence devoid of excitement. She
had received a letter from Craver relating what had taken place in
the Lincoln's Inn Fields office, and quite expected that her father
would be angry with her for telling secrets. But as he held his
peace she avoided any further reference to the ominous words he had
uttered, and possessed her soul in patience until such time as
Edwin would be able to help her. Everything was as dull as
ditchwater, and Claudia disliked the whole position extremely. But
so far as she could see there was nothing to be done.</p>

<p>Lemby's real reason for staying so much at home was that he
hoped to be within doors to receive Lady Wyke. But as day after day
went by and she never put in an appearance, the buccaneer began to
believe in his own phrase, that she was "kidding him." Finally,
when the week was ended, he shaved and dressed to go out and enjoy
himself, for things were getting on his nerves, and he felt the
need of change and fresh air. Claudia suggested that she should go
with him, as she felt hipped herself. Lemby, however, roundly said
that he wished to be by himself, and therefore went off alone. But
he was punished for his selfishness, for during his absence Lady
Wyke paid her promised call. She sent in her card while Claudia was
enjoying her solitary afternoon tea, and the girl was very much
amazed when she read the name. As her father had not informed her
that Sir Hector had been previously married, and that his wife
still lived. Miss Lemby believed that someone was playing a game.
Out of sheer curiosity she told the parlourmaid to show in the
visitor.</p>

<p>"You did not expect me?" questioned Lady Wyke, on arrival.</p>

<p>"No," answered Miss Lemby. "I am surprised to read the name on
this card."</p>

<p>"Strange," said the newcomer, thoughtfully. "Yet I explained
everything to your father a week ago in Mr. Sandal's office, and
said that I would call."</p>

<p>"My father told me nothing about the matter, Lady&mdash;" She
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Lady Wyke," said the visitor, politely.</p>

<p>"Are you Lady Wyke?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"But I did not know there was any Lady Wyke."</p>

<p>"You know now."</p>

<p>"Had Sir Hector a brother, then? Has he come in for the title,
and are you his wife?" Claudia asked all these questions in one
breath.</p>

<p>"Oh dear me, no, Miss Lemby. I was Sir Hector's wife, and I am
his widow. I see that your father has kept you quite in the dark.
Why, I don't know." Lady Wyke laughed in an amused manner, and
selected a comfortable chair. "As you have sat down, Miss Lemby, I
presume that I may sit also."</p>

<p>Claudia had indeed sunk into a chair, as the announcement took
her so greatly by surprise that she was unable to stand. "Are you
in earnest?" she asked her visitor, and taking no notice of the
last remark.</p>

<p>"Of course I am in earnest. If you doubt me, you can see Mr.
Sandal, who will show you my marriage certificate, and will tell
you that, as Sir Hector's widow, I inherit all his property."</p>

<p>"But Sir Hector was engaged to marry me," stammered the girl,
feeling dazed.</p>

<p>Lady Wyke waved her daintily-gloved hands airily. "Ah, poor man.
He believed that I was dead, and that he was free to marry again. I
learnt from a society newspaper in America, that such was the case,
and came over to tell him not to commit bigamy. For that reason he
postponed the wedding, and retired to Hedgerton."</p>

<p>"But why did he not tell me?" asked Claudia, growing crimson
with anger.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear&mdash;" Lady Wyke shrugged her elegant
shoulders "&mdash;it might be that he hoped to gain time and think
matters over. Perhaps he would have divorced me, although without
cause he could not have done so. Perhaps he might have murdered
me."</p>

<p>"I think he has behaved very badly!" cried the girl, with great
indignation.</p>

<p>"All men behave badly, Miss Lemby; they can't help themselves.
But as Sir Hector is dead, suppose we say no more about the matter.
After all&mdash;" she raised her glasses "&mdash;you don't look very
broken-hearted."</p>

<p>"I am not," Claudia assured her. "I never loved your
husband."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Then the title and the money attracted you."</p>

<p>"No. I was worried by my father into the position."</p>

<p>"I see. You love another."</p>

<p>"Yes." Claudia's eyes, from habit, wandered to a side table, on
which stood a silver frame containing the photograph of Edwin.</p>

<p>With the swiftness and grace of a swallow Lady Wyke swooped to
the other end of the room and took up the photograph. Then her face
changed, and, a variety of emotions displayed themselves rapidly.
Love, jealousy, fear, astonishment, and suspicion were all written
plainly for Claudia to see. "Why, it's him!"</p>

<p>"It is Mr. Edwin Craver, to whom I am engaged."</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" cried Lady Wyke, and threw down the photograph
to face the girl with a flushed face and hard eyes.</p>

<p>"Seeing that you do not know Mr. Craver, I do not see why you
should speak in that way," was Claudia's dignified reply.</p>

<p>"I do know him. I say that the photograph is one of 'Him.' I
call him that to myself, although until now I never heard his
name," and she clenched her hands so tightly that one glove
split.</p>

<p>The more angry Lady Wyke grew the cooler Claudia became, she had
received two great shocks; one was when Lady Wyke announced who she
was, and the other on hearing about the recognition of the photo.
Danger was in the air and it was Claudia's nature to face danger
calmly. "Where did you meet him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear," Lady Wyke was now quite her self-possessed self,
"it is quite a romance. I went to a motor-factory to buy a car, and
there I saw Mr. Craver, although I did not know his name, as I
never asked it. It was another man who attended to me, and I only
saw Mr. Craver at a distance. But he was so very handsome that I
admired him exceedingly. Although I am not so young as you are,
Miss Lemby, I have the heart and fresh feelings of a girl. After I
left the factory I thought a great deal about Mr. Craver."</p>

<p>"Did you indeed?" said. Claudia, hardly relishing this frank
confession.</p>

<p>"Now you are jealous. Well, I don't wonder at it. If I was
engaged to such a splendid young lover I should be jealous of
everyone who looked at him. However, I was beginning to forget him
when I went to Hendon to see the flying, and there saw Mr. Craver
in an aeroplane."</p>

<p>"You never did," said Claudia, excitedly. "Edwin does not go in
for aviation."</p>

<p>"Indeed he does. He went up in an aeroplane and spun about the
place like a tee-to-tum, looping the loop, and soaring and all the
rest of it. It made me so giddy that I had to close my eyes. But
when he came down safely I went up to his machine and congratulated
him on his courage. Then, my dear&mdash;" Lady Wyke made a gesture
of despair "&mdash;my heart was wholly lost to him. His good looks,
his bravery, his charming manners&mdash;can you blame me?"</p>

<p>Claudia declined to say whether she blamed her or not. "You must
be making a mistake," she said, in a disturbed manner. "Edwin
certainly is in a motor factory, and you might have seen him in
one. But he does not go in for aviation. He would have told me had
he taken up that profession."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't say that he is a professional," said Lady Wyke,
readily. "He is only an amateur, I fancy, and perhaps he did not
tell you what he was doing, lest you should worry. I know it would
break my heart to think that the man I loved was up in the air
risking his darling neck."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you should talk of Mr. Craver in that way, Lady
Wyke. He is engaged to me."</p>

<p>"For the time being, that is."</p>

<p>"For ever. How dare you hint at our parting."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear girl," said the visitor, impertinently, "you took
my husband, so why should I not take your lover?"</p>

<p>Claudia rose indignantly, and her mien was that of a queen in a
truly royal rage. "I won't allow you to talk to me in that way,"
she declared, heatedly. "So far as I am concerned, I did not wish
to marry your husband, and I never knew that he had a wife already.
My father forced me to consent, but now that Sir Hector is dead I
am going to have my own way and marry Edwin. You have caused quite
enough mischief, Lady Wyke."</p>

<p>"Mischief, when I saved you from a marriage you disliked?"</p>

<p>"You did not save me. Sir Hector was murdered, and that saved
me."</p>

<p>"One moment," said Lady Wyke, in cool tones, "you forgot that it
was my interposition which sent Sir Hector down to Hedgerton to
consider matters. Had he not gone there he might not have been
murdered, so I have saved you, in spite of all you say."</p>

<p>"Did you send him to Hedgerton to get him murdered?" asked
Claudia, scornfully.</p>

<p>Lady Wyke lost her breath at this insinuation, and rose
indignantly. When she got it again it was to protest. "You go too
far. Miss Lemby."</p>

<p>"Not so far as you go, madam. How dare you come here and tell me
that you love the man I am going to marry?"</p>

<p>"And how dare you accuse me of murdering my husband?"</p>

<p>The two women faced one another and looked into one another's
eyes, each trying to bear the other down. The widow felt her
inferiority under the girl's indignant gaze, but managed to retreat
gracefully.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, there is no use our quarrelling like two
fishwives. Sit down and let us talk."</p>

<p>"We have nothing to talk about, said Claudia, refusing to obey,
for by this time she had taken a deep dislike to Lady Wyke.</p>

<p>"Oh, but we have. Let us leave Mr. Craver on one side for the
time being. I told your father that I would call and see you. I am
sorry for you."</p>

<p>"Really. And why?"</p>

<p>"Because, by my reappearance and my husband's death you have
lost a title and a good income. I wish to make amends."</p>

<p>"I refuse to allow you to make amends."</p>

<p>"Now that I see you&mdash;" Lady Wyke put up her lorgnette
again&mdash;"I am not surprised. But your father wants money to
compensate him for failure, and I came here to offer it.</p>

<p>"My father is not at home," said Miss Lemby, coldly. "If you
will make an appointment you and he can talk the matter over. With
my father's concerns I have nothing to do."</p>

<p>Lady Wyke silently acknowledged that she was beaten, for the
time being at all events. Nevertheless, she as silently determined
to get the whip hand of this haughty girl and make her pay for such
insolence. The little woman liked no one to be insolent but
herself. Still, for the moment she veiled her enmity with Judas
smiles. "We part friends, I hope?" she said, with her sweetest
expression.</p>

<p>"No," returned Claudia, uncompromisingly. "We part as we
met&mdash;merely as acquaintances."</p>

<p>"I am sorry." Lady Wyke became plaintive. "I like you, and I don
t see why you should not like me. And you know, Miss Lemby, we
shall meet often in Hedgerton when we go to live there.</p>

<p>"You may be going to live there, I am not."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you will. Now that you have mentioned Mr. Craver's
name, I remember that his father is the Rector of Hedgerton. Mr.
Sandal told me so, amongst other matters, when I made inquiries
about the death of Hector. And when you marry Mr. Craver, or course
you will take up your residence near his people.</p>

<p>"Will I?" said Claudia, unsmilingly.</p>

<p>"I think you should, so as to make friends with his parents. And
I shall be in the parish also, as I have taken that house my
husband died in."</p>

<p>"Maranatha?" Miss Lemby looked astonished.</p>

<p>"Yes." Lady Wyke shot a keen glance at her. "It is said to be
unlucky, but, of course, I think that is rubbish. I intend to stay
there on the spot, in order to search for the murderer of my late
husband. We were not particularly good friends; but I owe it to his
memory to avenge his death. And perhaps, when the truth is known to
me, it need not be known to others&mdash;if you give up the idea of
marrying Mr. Craver."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Claudia turned cold as Lady Wyke halted at
the door.</p>

<p>"I mean,", said the other, "that your father was in the house
when my husband was killed. Think it over," and with a significant
smile she disappeared quickly.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_11" id=
"Chapter_11"></a>Chapter 11</b>
</h2>

<p>The last words of Lady Wyke, taken in conjunction with the last
words of her father before he paid his visit to Sandal, alarmed
Claudia exceedingly.</p>

<p>The high-spirited girl spent a miserable time alone before her
father appeared on the scene. She employed a few minutes in wiring
to Craver, saying that she wished him to call. In one way or
another Claudia determined to have an explanation, so that she
might know where she was. At present she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. Lemby made his appearance shortly before seven o'clock, and
seemed to be in very good spirits. He asked for his dinner,
declared that he felt better, and treated himself to a sherry and
bitters so as to give zest to his meal. Then, the dinner having
been cleared away, the two sat down to talk. Claudia began
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Lady Wyke was here this afternoon," she said, hurling the
bombshell at her father in the hope of startling him.</p>

<p>She failed to do so. "Yes, I know," he said, coolly. "I was
wondering when you would tell me about the matter."</p>

<p>"I waited for you to speak first," said Claudia, rather annoyed.
"You should have explained things to me long ago."</p>

<p>"I didn't think it was necessary," protested the pirate.</p>

<p>"Not necessary? Why, dad. Sir Hector wanted to marry me while he
had a wife living, and for that reason postponed our marriage."</p>

<p>"I know, confound you," growled Lemby. "But Wyke didn't know
that his wife was alive. If he had he would not have proposed to
you. I suppose she told you all about the dashed thing?"</p>

<p>"She explained much, but not all. I think you might speak,
dad."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind," rejoined the old man, good-humouredly, and
then and there related the past of the dead man. He stated how Lady
Wyke had been the actress Maisie Chain, and how Sandal had
witnessed the ill-omened wedding. Then he told Claudia about the
separation, the journey to America, the presumed death in the fire
at the Chicago theatre, and finally described how Lady Wyke had
learnt her husband's determination to marry again. "So she came
over to prevent that," he concluded, "and so completely knocked the
old man off his perch that he ran away to hide from her at
Hedgerton."</p>

<p>"What did he intend to do?" asked Claudia, after she had
digested the story. Lemby shrugged his shoulders. "Ask me another,
my girl? I don't know. Whether he intended to lie low until he
could get rid of her and marry you, or whether he intended to stick
to her and chuck you I can't say. Seeing that she's a bit of a
tartar, I guess he wanted to divorce her if possible."</p>

<p>"Could he have done so?"</p>

<p>"Lady Wyke says he couldn't, as she has always kept herself
respectable."</p>

<p>"I don't think that Sir Hector was to blame," said Claudia,
after a pause "except in not telling me and you before he went to
Hedgerton."</p>

<p>"I should have squeezed the explanation out of him when I paid
him that visit, my girl, if he hadn't gone to see the man who
killed him."</p>

<p>"Do you know the man who killed him?" asked the girl in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," denied the pirate, roundly, but looking uneasy,
"and I wish you'd stop harping on that dashed murder, Claudia.
Wyke's dead and buried, and his widow has got the cash, so let the
whole shoot slide."</p>

<p>"How can I when you hinted that you were mixed up in the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I only said that to get you to come to Australia with me,"
said her father, rising with a yawn and stretching himself
lazily.</p>

<p>"But Lady Wyke says the same thing."</p>

<p>Lemby dropped his arms and his mouth shut like a steel trap.
"Tell me what that dashed woman said."</p>

<p>Claudia repeated Lady Wyke's last words verbatim. "And she said
that, although the truth was known to her, it need not be known to
others if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If what; if what? Don't stop," rapped out the buccaneer,
sharply.</p>

<p>"If I refused to marry Edwin."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Lemby's black eyes grew larger and rounder. "Why did she
say that? She doesn't know Craver."</p>

<p>"Yes, she does. She saw him at the factory and at Hendon."</p>

<p>"What was he doing at Hendon?"</p>

<p>"Flying," said Claudia, curtly.</p>

<p>"You don't say so. I never thought he'd have the pluck to go up
in an aeroplane, my girl. I wish he'd break his dashed neck."</p>

<p>"How dare you say that, dad! Edwin is the bravest man in the
world, and if he broke his neck I should die. I love him. I love
him and she shall never, never take him from me."</p>

<p>"She. Who?"</p>

<p>"Lady Wyke. She has fallen in love with Edwin."</p>

<p>Lemby's face grew evil and lowering. "Then I again say that I
wish he'd break his dashed neck," he cried with an oath. "Confound
the fellow, he comes up against me at every turn. First, he tried
to spoil my plans with regard to your marriage with Wyke, and now
he is my rival."</p>

<p>"Your rival?" Claudia looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes, hang him. I can't get the money for you by will, as
everything has been left to that woman. So I've got an idea that
she might marry me."</p>

<p>"Marry you?" Claudia started up from the chair she was seated
in. "I hope you won't be so silly as to marry at your age."</p>

<p>"Don't be insolent, my girl," retorted Lemby, for his vanity was
hurt. "I'm by no means an old man. There's many a kick left in me
yet. Why shouldn't I marry Lady Wyke? She isn't bad-looking, and
has the five thousand a year we want so badly."</p>

<p>"I don't want it!" cried Claudia, vehemently? "I wouldn't take a
penny of it, dad. She's a horrid and dangerous woman. I object to
having her for a stepmother, There!" and she stamped after her
usual fashion.</p>

<p>"Well, then," snarled Lemby, crossly, "you can prevent my having
my own way by letting her marry Craver, since it seems he is in
love with her."</p>

<p>"He isn't in love with her. I never said so. She is in love with
him. As to letting her marry him, she shan't! You are cruel to
suggest such a thing."</p>

<p>Lemby clutched his head. "Dash it, things are so crooked that I
must straighten them out somehow by suggesting," he said, angrily.
"And if this young jackaroo is trying to spoil my plans again, I'll
make it hot for him. Upon my word, Claudia, I think it best that
you should marry the fellow, so that I may be able to make Lady
Wyke my wife and collar the dibs."</p>

<p>"She won't have you, dad."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she will." Lemby glanced at the nearest mirror, and
admired his big body, his black hair, his stalwart looks and
general virility. "I may as well tell you that I met her when she
came downstairs after seeing you, and I took her to a teashop to
have a talk. We got on famously."</p>

<p>"Did she tell you that she suspected you of committing the
murder?" asked Claudia, acidly, and not approving of this
escapade.</p>

<p>"No, she didn't. If she had I'd have brought her to her
senses."</p>

<p>"You'll never do that. She's too clever for you, dad."</p>

<p>Claudia had just uttered this remark in a very positive way when
Jane, the parlourmaid, showed young Craver into the drawing-room.
Lemby was by no means so pleased to see him as Claudia was, and
looked at their greeting glumly. He was quite annoyed when he heard
that his daughter had summoned this inconvenient third by telegram.
Edwin, who looked smart and well-groomed in evening dress, nodded
coolly to his prospective father-in-law and sat down. Then Lemby
could contain himself no longer.</p>

<p>"What the deuce do you mean by treating me as nothing in my own
house?" he demanded, clenching his big fists with a truculent
air.</p>

<p>"I apologise if I have treated you impolitely," said Edwin,
raising his eyebrows; "but as you have never shaken hands with me,
or bid me welcome; I do not see what you expect me to do."</p>

<p>"Be civil," growled the buccaneer, and dropped into an armchair
to fill his pipe. "I'd have dropped you at sight with my little gun
had you behaved in this cheeky way to me in Australia."</p>

<p>"I'm not so easily dropped." retorted Craver, laughing, for the
man's childish behaviour was not worth noticing. "Two can play at
that game, Mr. Lemby. But as Claudia wants to tell me something,
don't you think you can treat me as your guest and with courtesy
for a few minutes?"</p>

<p>Turning towards her lover, Claudia rapidly told him all about
Lady Wyke and her visit. Craver was amazed by the story, and could
not believe that Wyke had been married.</p>

<p>"How do you know that this woman is not an impostor?" he asked
Mr. Lemby over Claudia's shoulder.</p>

<p>The pirate grunted. "She ain't," he declared, decisively.
"Sandal knows all about the marriage, and knows her and knows about
the will leaving the cash to her, hang her! She's not an impostor,
worse luck. And, what's more, she's a dashed pretty woman."</p>

<p>"Do you think so, Edwin?" asked Claudia, anxiously and
significantly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" The young man smiled broadly. "Then she told you that she
had met me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Both at Hendon and at your factory. Edwin, you did not
tell me that you went in for aviation."</p>

<p>"I was keeping it as a surprise for you. But I can explain all
about my reasons later. Meanwhile we have ample to talk about. Yes,
I did see Lady Wyke at the factory, where she came to buy a car.
Afterwards I saw her at Hendon, when she congratulated me on a
successful flight. She's a pretty woman created by her own
art."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" demanded Lemby, growling like a dog
over a bone.</p>

<p>"I mean that she is painted and powdered, and padded and
overdressed, and all the rest of it. She is mutton trying to look
like lamb."</p>

<p>"Then you don't love her?" said Claudia, with a sob of
relief.</p>

<p>"Darling," said the astonished young man, "are you mad? How
could I love a woman of that kind? And, remember, I have only seen
her twice."</p>

<p>"She loves you, however," said Lemby, grimly.</p>

<p>Edwin stared at him. "Is this a joke?" he asked, sternly. "If so
it is not a good one, and you display bad taste in making it, Mr.
Lemby."</p>

<p>"I am in earnest, as it happens," said the old man, drily, "and
don't tell me what's good taste or bad taste, dash you! Lady Wyke
saw your photograph over there, and recognised you, Claudia told
her your name, which she said she had never heard."</p>

<p>"Then she is telling lies," said Craver, calmly. "I was
introduced to her at the factory when I sold her the car."</p>

<p>"She said that another person attended to her," said Claudia,
quickly.</p>

<p>"I attended to her. Lady Wyke is evidently an accomplished liar.
As to being in love with a man she has only seen twice, she must be
joking."</p>

<p>"It didn't sound like joking," remarked the girl, wretchedly.
"She hinted that dad was concerned in the death of her husband, but
that she would say nothing if I refused to marry you."</p>

<p>"I'll twist her neck if she accuses me of a crime of which I am
innocent," was Lemby's observation; "and when I marry her I'll soon
bring her to heel."</p>

<p>"Are you going to marry her?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I, Craver? She's rich and dashed pretty, in my
opinion. I want money, and I can put up with her. Do you object?"
he asked, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Not at all," rejoined Edwin, promptly, "I don't want her. I
shall tell her so if she makes advances to me&mdash;on one
condition, that is."</p>

<p>Lemby scowled. "What condition?"</p>

<p>"That you allow Claudia to pay a month's visit to my parents at
Hedgerton Rectory. I have told them that I love her, and they are
anxious to see her."</p>

<p>Claudia, longing for peace and quietness, clapped her hands.
"Oh, I should like that above all things. Do say yes, dad."</p>

<p>To the surprise of both young people, the pirate agreed very
amicably. "The fact is, I haven't enough money to run this flat
much longer," he explained, coolly; "so if Claudia goes away for a
month, I can stay here on short commons. Mind, I don't say that I
agree to your marrying her, Craver. I let her go to Hedgerton for
my convenience, not for yours."</p>

<p>"Dad, how excessively rude," cried the girl, colouring.</p>

<p>"Rude or not, you can go. As to Lady Wyke, if Craver will sheer
off, I think I can bring her to reason. Wyke should have left the
five thousand a year to you, Claudia. So, as we can't get it by
will, we'll get it by marriage."</p>

<p>"I rather think you will find Lady Wyke a difficult woman to
manage," said Edwin, warningly. "She's an adventuress of the worst
type."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm an adventurer," retorted Lemby, "I know how to size
her up."</p>

<p>"What about her accusation, dad?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a wife can't give evidence against her husband," said
Lemby, coolly.</p>

<p>The young people, still mystified by the ambiguous way in which
Lemby spoke, glanced at one another.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_12" id=
"Chapter_12"></a>Chapter 12</b>
</h2>

<p>It was with a heavy heart that Claudia went to Hedgerton. She
could by no means understand the behaviour of her father, who
certainly talked, in a most contradictory manner. At one moment he
denied that he had anything to do with the death of his old friend,
yet the next hinted at mysterious risks undertaken to obtain
money.</p>

<p>Naturally, the change of scene, with new people to talk to, and
with new occupations, did her infinite good. To her the rectory was
a haven of peace, and Edwin a strong-armed man, who could and would
defend her. The welcome of Mr. and Mrs. Craver comforted her
exceedingly, as they were charmed with their visitor, and
thoroughly approved of her in every way, The Rector, who was a
white-haired, gentle-faced old gentleman, fonder of literature than
of humanity, admired her beauty greatly, while little Mrs. Craver
pronounced her to be an uncommonly sensible girl. Within the week,
Claudia was comfortably settled in her new surroundings, and was
happier than she had been since her arrival in England. On the plea
that Mrs. Craver could teach her housekeeping, she took her share
of the work and became quite a busy bee. Her prospective
mother-in-law found her quite an able assistant. Poor, weary Mrs.
Craver had toiled and struggled and scrimped and screwed for so
many years alone that it was quite a relief for her to see a
younger person attend to the work. And Claudia enjoyed this
domesticity, greatly.</p>

<p>Lemby displayed no desire to call at the Rectory and see the
parents of the young man whom his daughter desired to marry, He
remained in London, as a gentleman-at-large, and still continued to
live in Tenby Mansions&mdash;that is, he camped there, for his
hours were generally passed elsewhere, although he returned nightly
to sleep in the flat. When he did write to Claudia, which was
rarely, it was to congratulate her that she had free board and
lodging at the Hedgerton Rectory, since money was so scarce. These
letters made the girl work all the harder, as she was too proud to
live on strangers, and wished on all and every occasion to make
some return for bed and board and fire. Ardent as, Mrs. Craver was
about work, she took it upon herself to restrain Claudia's zeal,
and insisted that she should not do much.</p>

<p>"As a rule I have to drive people to work," said Mrs. Craver at
afternoon tea, "but you, my dear, require to be checked. I never
met anyone like you."</p>

<p>"So Edwin thinks," remarked the Rector, who had a book on his
knee and a cup of tea in his hand. "He says that Claudia is a pearl
and far above rubies in value. I quite agree with him."</p>

<p>"Oh, you must not think so highly, of me," said the girl with a
blush. "I am really a very ordinary kind of person. I love
work."</p>

<p>"Then you are not an ordinary person," said the Rev. George
Craver. "It is very rarely one meets with people who love work. If
Hedgerton was filled with such people my task would be easier than
it is."</p>

<p>Mrs. Craver shook her brisk little head, and her sharp face
looked sharper than ever. "The Hedgerton people are too
self-complacent, George. You can talk and talk and talk, but no
impression can be made."</p>

<p>"I think, that I am making an impression on Lady Wyke, Emma. She
attends the services regularly, and has done so since she came here
a month ago."</p>

<p>Mrs. Craver straightened her slim figure, which was clothed in
the shabby black silk, and looked severe. "Lady Wyke comes, to show
off her frocks. She is sinfully extravagant in dress."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Emma, you must not assign such a reason for her
attendance at church. She really is most attentive to the services,
and also she desires to help in the parish work. She told me
so."</p>

<p>"She would tell you anything, George, and you would believe her.
Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Sir Hector's widow," said Claudia, looking surprised, at this
unnecessary remark. "Everyone knows that."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," agreed Mrs. Craver, significantly. "She is the widow
of that poor man, sure enough. But who is she? Where does she come
from?"</p>

<p>"She comes from London, Emma," said the Rector, humorously, "and
she lives in Hedgerton."</p>

<p>"Why does she live here, George?"</p>

<p>"Well, she must live somewhere."</p>

<p>"But not in the very house in which her husband was murdered, To
my mind, it is a ghoulish idea for her to rent Maranatha, seeing,
what took place there."</p>

<p>"It is odd," admitted Claudia, musingly. "I wonder why?"</p>

<p>Mr. Craver reached forward to take another slice of bread. "It
may be that she wishes to learn who murdered Sir Hector, and,
therefore, thinks that she will be more successful if she remains
in the house where the crime was committed."</p>

<p>Claudia winced, and her thoughts flew to her father and his
mysterious remarks; to Lady Wyke and her ominous hints. "Has she
discovered anything yet?"</p>

<p>"No!" observed Mrs. Craver, sharply. "At least, she has said
nothing to us, although she has been here a month. And that reminds
me, George, that she has not called again since Claudia
arrived."</p>

<p>"Well, Emma, she called on you and you called on her. The
demands of courtesy have been satisfied. We are dull people, you
know, and she is a smart lady. It is not to be supposed that she
will find much enjoyment in our society."</p>

<p>"Indeed, George, she would find our society very instructive.
She may be smart, as you say, but she certainly is not a lady."</p>

<p>Claudia nodded. "I did not think so myself when I saw her in
Loudon."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes&mdash;" Mrs. Craver turned briskly "&mdash;of course, you
saw her. Considering how badly Sir Hector behaved to you, my dear,
I wonder she had the impudence to call. What courage she must
have."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, Mrs. Craver," Claudia shrugged, carelessly.
"Naturally Lady Wyke was anxious to see me, seeing that I was to
marry her husband. He was not to blame, poor man, as he quite
believed that she was dead."</p>

<p>"She had no business to come alive again," retorted Mrs. Craver.
"Yet I am glad, for Edwin's sake, that things have turned out as
they have done."</p>

<p>"My dear Emma, you couldn't expect Lady Wyke to allow her
husband to commit bigamy. Why shouldn't she come alive again, as
you put it?"</p>

<p>"She should have remained always with her husband, as a true and
faithful wife should," replied Mrs. Craver, drawing up her spare
figure.</p>

<p>"I don't think that the separation was Sir Hector's fault," said
Claudia, after a pause. "He was a very polite and amiable old man.
I certainly did not wish to marry him, as I always loved Edwin. But
my father made me accept."</p>

<p>"Strange, my dear, seeing how strong-minded you are."</p>

<p>"You have not met my father," rejoined the girl, briefly.</p>

<p>"I don't think I want to. Of course, when you marry Edwin, he
must come to the wedding, I suppose, and give you away. But he is
much too dashing a gentleman for quiet people such as we are."</p>

<p>"Why, Emma," said the Rector, surprised, "I did not know you had
seen him."</p>

<p>"I saw him outside the doors of the Entertainment Hall when the
inquest was taking place. I happened to be passing on that day.
Your father, my dear&mdash;" she addressed Claudia "&mdash;is a
handsome man; but I should think he has a temper."</p>

<p>"He has," said the man's daughter, significantly. "Perhaps, if
you knew my father you would not want me to marry Edwin."</p>

<p>"What nonsense. I love you for your own sweet sake. Your father
will go back to Australia, I hope, and then we need not be bothered
with him."</p>

<p>"Emma! Emma!"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't help it, George. After all, in trying to make
Claudia marry that old man who died, Mr. Lemby did not behave very
well."</p>

<p>"All the same, he is Claudia's father," said the Rector,
reprovingly.</p>

<p>The girl flushed, and then turned rather pale, as she felt a
trifle embarrassed during this discussion. If Mrs. Craver talked of
her father in this way when he was absent, what would she say when
he was present. The precise, refined little lady would never get on
with the pirate, who was all that she was not.</p>

<p>Mrs. Craver, less observant than the Rector, accepted the
reproof, although she did not notice Claudia's change of colour,
and went on to make other remarks dealing with another subject.</p>

<p>"I only hope that Lady Wyke's example will not ruin the parish,"
she observed. "She is an extravagant woman, and you wouldn't know
Maranatha now that she is living there. I'm sure when I called and
saw the quantity of new furniture she has, and the silk curtains,
and the fine pictures to say nothing of the many flowers and the
expensive china, I thought how rich she must be."</p>

<p>"She has five thousand a year," said Claudia. "That was the
amount of money left to her by her husband."</p>

<p>"Which would have been yours, my dear, had you married him.
However, it is just as well since you love Edwin."</p>

<p>"What is just as well, Emma?" asked Mr. Craver, who found his
wife's remarks a trifle confusing on occasions.</p>

<p>"That Lady Wyke should have come to life, and that Claudia
should be poor. I am sure that Edwin will become a partner in that
motor firm, and then he will be well able to support a wife. By the
way, Lady Wyke's motor-car was manufactured by Edwin's firm. Before
you came down, Claudia, she asked Edwin to show her how to
drive."</p>

<p>"And did he?" asked Claudia, wincing when she thought of Lady
Wyke's admiration for her lover.</p>

<p>"No. He said that he was too busy and had to get back to town.
And now that I come to think of it George, Edwin really went back
to London, as he had to fly. My heart sinks when I hear of these
aviation accidents. A man with a mother should not fly."</p>

<p>"Nor should, an engaged man," chimed in the Rector, "and Edwin
is engaged. Don't you think, Claudia, that you could persuade him
to give up aviation?"</p>

<p>"I'll try." said the girl, with a faint sigh. "I don't like the
idea myself, but Edwin is very determined when he likes."</p>

<p>"Just like me," said Mrs. Craver, complacently. "I am always
firm."</p>

<p>"Obstinate," said Mr. Craver, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Before his wife could argue that obstinacy and firmness were
entirely different, the parlourmaid entered with the information
that Mrs. Mellin wished to speak to her mistress. Mrs. Craver was
surprised, as this was not the day when washing arrived and the
report of various doings in the parish was made. Something unusual
must have caused Mrs. Mellin to come unexpectedly to the Rectory,
so the eager little woman hurried out to learn what was the matter.
Mr. Craver frankly laughed when alone with Claudia. His wife's
energy, always amused him.</p>

<p>"Emma should have been a detective," he remarked to Claudia.
"She is always on the look-out for information, and knows
everything that is going on in the parish. Depend upon it, Mrs.
Mellin, who is her assistant-detective, has come with startling
news, and Emma will return to startle us with some kind of a storm
in a tea-cup."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Craver is the dearest woman in the world," said Claudia,
with a sympathetic laugh, "and I like her mannerisms. To me she is
kindness itself."</p>

<p>"Who would not be kind to you, my dear."</p>

<p>Claudia was not emotional as a rule, but her eyes filled with
tears at the paternal tone of the Rector's speech. She leant
forward impetuously and took his hand. "You don't know how happy I
am here," she cried, impulsively. "This place is like heaven to me.
And yet perhaps it would be wiser for me to go away and forget
Edwin."</p>

<p>Mr. Craver patted her hand. "Why should you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my father and I are a kind of stormy petrel pair of birds.
Wherever we go there is sure to be trouble. I should not like to
bring trouble into this haven of peace."</p>

<p>"We'll take the risk, Claudia. We all love you, and now that you
are here, here you will remain until Edwin makes you his wife.
There is no reason why you should go away."</p>

<p>"I shall stay here willingly," she said, with a sigh of relief.
"I am only too glad to stay here."</p>

<p>Just as she made this speech the door opened, and Mrs. Craver
rushed into the room with flushed face and startled eyes. Evidently
Mrs. Mellin had told her something of moment. "Oh,
George&mdash;" she spoke while moving into the room "&mdash;do you
remember Laura Bright? I wonder I did not recognise her."</p>

<p>"Laura Bright, Mrs. Mellin's sister, who ran away twenty and
more years ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! The same. I wonder I did not recognise her. She is
Lady Wyke. I mean Lady Wyke is Laura. And I never recognised
her."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_13" id=
"Chapter_13"></a>Chapter 13</b>
</h2>

<p>Little Mrs. Craver was greatly excited over the discovery that
Lady Wyke was none other than flighty Laura Bright, the sister of
the humble washerwoman. It was not surprising that the Rector's
wife had not recognised her, as the brilliant woman of the world
was very different from the pretty, discontented, and unformed girl
who had gone away from Hedgerton some twenty and more years
previous. Indeed, Mrs. Mellin herself confessed that she would
never have recognised her sister, had not that sister called upon
her to proclaim her identity. Evidently Lady Wyke had no false
pride, for she calmly stated who she was, and talked over family
affairs with Mrs. Mellin. Old James Bright, who had been the father
of the two women, was dead, and so was the mother. The
washerwoman's husband had passed away, leaving her with one son,
and Lady Wyke was a widow, with no child at all. It was for this
reason that she had called on Mrs. Mellin.</p>

<p>"You could have knocked me down with a feather, ma'am, when that
grand lady come along, saying as she was my very own sister Laura.
Not a bit of pride about her, ma'am, for she sat down and took tea,
just as if she was no one in pertic'ler."</p>

<p>"It does her credit," said Mrs. Craver, approvingly. "I think
the better of Lady Wyke for not being ashamed of her humble origin.
She has greatly improved from the flighty girl she was."</p>

<p>"Clever, ma'am," interposed Mrs. Mellin, proudly, "never
flighty."</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh! She was a very feather, Mrs. Mellin. But we won't
discuss her weaknesses. I suppose she called in order to help
you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mellin rubbed her nose. "She did and she didn't, ma'am. So
far as I'm concerned, she said she didn't mind giving me a pound or
so when wanted. But she really called about Neddy."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed. And what about Neddy?"</p>

<p>"Laura ses," Pursued Mrs. Mellin, wiping her mouth with a corner
of her well-known tartan shawl, "as Neddy is the only one of our
family left, and is as bewtiful as a angel and 'ave a voice like a
bird. A skylark she called 'im, and wants to git 'im singing in
London."</p>

<p>"Ridiculous!" cried the Rector's wife, vigorously. "Let her give
him a good education and apprentice him to some trade."</p>

<p>"So I ses, ma'am, me bein' 'umble and Neddy my boy. But bless
you, ma'am, Laura wouldn't 'ear of it, sayin' as 'is voice was
wonnerful, and the gift of 'Eaven, which it 'ud be a shame not to
'ave 'eard. Had a long tork with 'her I did, ma'am, and Laura ses,
as she was on the music 'all stage 'erself, and didn't see no 'arm
in it, nohow. So she ses as she's goin' to send Neddy to London to
appear as the Skylark at the Tit-Bits Music 'All."</p>

<p>"Ridiculous! Ridiculous!" said Mrs. Craver, again. "A choir-boy
and a music-hall. The two things don't go together."</p>

<p>"They won't, ma'am." retorted Mrs. Mellin, rather defiantly.
"Neddy 'ull leave the choir when he becomes the Tit-Bits Skylark.
Laura's goin' to 'ave 'is voice trained with a pal of 'er's as
sings 'isself, and with 'im Neddy can stay, Laura payin' 'is board
and lodgin'. Week-ends he can come down 'ere for me to 'ave a look
at 'im and look arter 'is washing, never trustin' them London
laundresses as I don't no'ow. So there you are, ma'am. Fortune hev
come to me and Neddy at larst."</p>

<p>"I don't approve of it, Mrs. Mellin, and the Rector won't
approve of it either, you may be sure. I'll speak to him and to
Lady Wyke myself."</p>

<p>Mrs. Craver did so, but gained small satisfaction, for Lady Wyke
firmly held to her opinion and refused to listen to the little
woman's entreaties. As to the Rector, he also ventured on a mild
remonstrance, but Neddy's aunt quickly routed him. She declared
that it was better for Neddy to earn his bread by means of his
great gift than to remain in Hedgerton, loafing about and
consorting with bad boys. In the end Lady Wyke got her own way, as
such a hard and determined woman would, so Neddy arrayed in a new
suit of clothes, was packed off to London forthwith. He was more
than willing to go, as he looked forward to a life of excitement,
while his mother was willing that he should try his luck, as she
hoped that his voice would win sufficient money for him to support
her in her old age. And as the two sisters were thus agreed,
neither Mrs. Craver nor the Rector could do anything, although they
highly disapproved of the step taken. But they fought desperately
that Neddy should learn a trade, and the battle was prolonged for
quite a month. At the end of that exciting time, the young scamp
went to London, and the fight ended in the triumph of his mother
and aunt. Mrs. Craver was much grieved over her defeat.</p>

<p>During the month things went on very smoothly. Edwin came and
went, attended to his motor work, and between times essayed flying
with more or less success.</p>

<p>Lady Wyke never came near the rectory during the four weeks,
rather to Miss Lemby's surprise. Claudia quite expected that after
the visit paid to the flat and the hint given that Lady Wyke would
seek her out again and still pursue her object, which was to take
possession of young Craver. But Sir Hector's widow remained
ostentatiously away, and Claudia saw her only in church and
occasionally on the esplanade. Short as was the time which had
elapsed since her husband's death, the widow was already changing
her mourning for dresses less aggressively dismal. From black her
gowns turned into violet, and on some days she appeared in grey,
always looking smart and fashionable, well-turned-out, and
remarkably young.</p>

<p>With keen feminine instinct, Claudia guessed that Lady Wyke was
on the warpath, and still cherished a desire to marry Edwin. Seeing
that she had only met him once or twice, and that she knew he was
engaged to Claudia, it seemed ridiculous that she should hope to
win him. Yet her coming down to Hedgerton, her amelioration of
mourning-frocks, and her frequent attendance at church to win over
Edwin's parents, all suggested to Miss Lemby's clever and rather
jealous nature that the widow had not got over her infatuation.
Those superior residents of Hedgerton, who knew something of the
outside world, invariably spoke of her as "The Merry Widow."
Claudia frankly hated her.</p>

<p>This being the case, it was unpleasant that she should meet with
the schemer unexpectedly and be forced to have a conversation.</p>

<p>It was now March and there crept into the keen air a breath of
spring. The sky was intensely blue, the chestnut buds were glummy,
and the wayside hedges were greening over with tiny leaves. As the
village, with its ancient fish-like smells, was not inviting, the
girl often walked along the verge of the cliffs beyond the Rectory,
and watched the murmuring waves ebbing and flowing on the sandy
beach below. On the day she met Lady Wyke the sunshine was
unusually warm and brilliant, and the azure of the sky, the deep
blue of the sea, the reddish stretch of cliffs, and the delicate,
green budding of the trees made up an uncommonly pretty picture.
Claudia walked along for quite a mile and then sat down to rest
near a coastguard station. The winds brought colour to her cheeks,
sunshine light to her eyes, and the girl looked extremely young and
extremely pretty.</p>

<p>"A penny for your thoughts, Miss Lemby," said Lady Wyke, in her
shrill, sharp, and unpleasant voice.</p>

<p>Claudia started violently, as the newcomer had stolen up so
quietly behind that she was not aware, of her proximity until she
spoke. "Good-day, Lady Wyke," she answered, quietly, "I fear my
thoughts are not worth even the small sum you offer."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know so much about that." Lady Wyke, a brilliant
figure in black touched here and there with orange ribbons, leant
with both hands on the smart silver-headed cane which she carried.
"Young girls dream of satin frocks and orange-wreaths, of handsome
bridegrooms and the wedding march."</p>

<p>"You are not a good thought-reader," said Claudia, coldly.</p>

<p>"Ha! we all make mistakes. Then you were thinking of your
father, and of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of things which it is not necessary for you to know,"
interrupted the girl, with provoking calmness. "My thoughts are my
own."</p>

<p>"What an obvious remark." Lady Wyke put up her lorgnette and
surveyed Claudia, inquisitively. "Very obvious for so clever a
girl."</p>

<p>"How do you know that I am clever?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think a girl with a shady father, who does her best to
ingratiate herself with prejudiced people because she wants to
marry their son is clever."</p>

<p>"What right have you to say that my father is shady?" asked
Claudia, still composed, and mistress of herself.</p>

<p>Lady Wyke laughed. "Oh, your father and I have had quite a
correspondence," she said, airily. "He was a great friend of my
late husband's, you know, and professes anxiety to help me discover
who killed poor Hector. He writes suggesting theories, and I write
back to say that he is talking rubbish. But I rather think," added
the woman, shrewdly, "that there is more in your father's
attentions to me than zeal for revenge on the man who murdered
Hector."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" Claudia coloured as she knew very well what her
father's intentions were. "But all this does not warrant your
calling him shady."</p>

<p>"Well, no. All the same, I may have other reasons. Miss Lemby. I
think you are a nice honest girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but isn't this conversation rather personal?"</p>

<p>"I mean it to be," replied Lady Wyke, serenely. "You see, it is
just as well that you and I should understand one another."</p>

<p>"I see no reason why we should. We are strangers," retorted
Claudia, very much annoyed by the brazen impudence of the
speaker.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think we are strangers, Miss Lemby, seeing that you
were on the eve of marrying my husband."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't marry him, and what is more, I never wished to
marry him. It was my father's scheme to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To get money," interposed Lady Wyke, softly. "Didn't I say that
he was shady, Miss Lemby? You, in a way, admit as much
yourself."</p>

<p>"I admit nothing&mdash;" Claudia rose abruptly to her
feet "&mdash;and I really do not see, Lady Wyke, why you should
force your company on me in this way."</p>

<p>"There are many things you don't see, but will be made to see,
my dear," said the elder woman, insolently. "I saw you leave the
Rectory and followed you to this place so that I might talk to you
quietly."</p>

<p>"I see no reason why I should listen," chafed Claudia,
restlessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think you will when I say what I have come to say,"
answered Lady Wyke. "To tell, you the truth I quite expected you to
call and see me at Maranatha."</p>

<p>"I never had the least idea of continuing our acquaintance,"
retorted the girl, pointedly. "Our last meeting in London did not
make me long to meet you again, Lady Wyke. Your last words
hinted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall talk about my hints on another occasion," interrupted
the other in sharp tones. "Meanwhile I have sought you out to make
you an offer."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" Claudia was quite unmoved.</p>

<p>"Yes. You are poor."</p>

<p>"That is my own affair."</p>

<p>"And your father is poor," continued Lady 'Wyke, taking no
notice of the interruption. "You both want money. Your father, as I
can see very well, is paying attentions to me in the hope that I
may look favourably upon his advances."</p>

<p>Claudia was persistently blind. "What advances?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you will have it, my dear, your father has more than
hinted that he desires to marry me. He could not get Sir Hector's
money through you, so he is now trying to get it through me."</p>

<p>"Is he? Well, Lady Wyke, with what my father says or does or
thinks, I have nothing to do. If he wishes to marry you, and you
accept him, I have nothing to say. It is none of my business."</p>

<p>"But as your father's daughter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. I know all about that," flashed out the girl quickly, and
with flushed cheeks; "but there is no more to be said."</p>

<p>"There is this. That I do not intend to marry your father."</p>

<p>"That is his and your affair. It has nothing to do with me. What
have I to do with your intentions, Lady Wyke?"</p>

<p>"You may guess," rejoined the woman, in silky tones, "when I
tell you that I wish to marry Mr. Craver."</p>

<p>Claudia flushed still deeper, and looked indignant. Then the
humour of this insolence calmed her and made her laugh. And laugh
she did, right in the face of Lady Wyke's artificial beauty. "I am
not afraid," said Claudia, after looking her rival up and down with
all the contempt of youth for age.</p>

<p>The woman clenched her hands, grew a deep red, and quivered from
head to foot, as nothing could have been said, calculated to wound
her more. However, having an object to gain she kept her temper. "I
said before that you are poor, and so is your father. He can't get
money by marrying me, as I wish to marry Mr. Craver. But your
father can get money, and so can you, if you will stand on one side
and refuse to become Mr. Craver's wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! And how much do you propose to offer me as a
bribe?"</p>

<p>Lady Wyke, thinking from the soft tone that Claudia was willing
to consider her proposal, became eager. "I shall give you a
thousand a year," she said rapidly, and advancing a step. "Think
what you can do with that! It is quite a fortune in Australia. You
can return there with your father, and keep him in his old age.
Think, Miss Lemby&mdash;a thousand a year!"</p>

<p>Claudia laughed again, and again Lady Wyke winced. "I don't
think that there, is any need to say more. Good-day," and she moved
away.</p>

<p>"Stop, stop!" screamed Lady Wyke. "I want my answer."</p>

<p>Claudia looked over her shoulder laughing persistently. "There
is no answer."</p>

<p>"Very good." Lady Wyke quivered and turned pale under her rouge.
"I have made you a fair offer, and you have refused even to
consider it. Now look out for yourself and for your father."</p>

<p>Claudia laughed still louder, and continued to walk away.
"Good-day, Lady Wyke!"</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_14" id=
"Chapter_14"></a>Chapter 14</b>
</h2>

<p>Needless to say Claudia did not report the conversation with
Lady Wyke to the Rector or to his wife, as neither of them would
have understood, so shameless a chase of age after youth. But the
girl was anxious to disburden her mind, and looked forward
anxiously for the arrival of Edwin, who was expected down to spend
the usual week-end. After luncheon the Rector retired to write his
sermon, while Mrs. Craver found that she had household duties to
do. The young couple were left alone, and forthwith Claudia related
all that had taken place on the cliffs. Her lover was greatly
annoyed.</p>

<p>"But we can't talk over things quietly here," he said, taking
Claudia's arm and moving towards the dining-room door. "Mother is
sure to pop in and out when least expected, and I don't want her to
hear about Lady Wyke's vagaries."</p>

<p>"I have said nothing, Edwin."</p>

<p>He squeezed her arm. "That is wise of you, dearest. Let us go
into the garden and thresh the matter out. I have something to tell
you also."</p>

<p>They found a secluded arbour at the bottom of what was called
the Laurel Walk from its hedges, and there sat down comfortably. It
was quite a place for lovers, and being springtime, they should
have paid their devotions to Cupid. But matters were much too
serious for trifling of this sort, and the golden hour was filled
with the discussion of important matters. Edwin's very first remark
made Claudia angry&mdash;and with her lover.</p>

<p>"Lady Wyke has ben persecuting me with personal attentions and
with letters."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The girl's eyes flashed and her cheeks grew red. "Why
didn't you tell me, Edwin?"</p>

<p>"I didn't wish to worry you, dear."</p>

<p>"Your worries are my worries, Edwin. I wish to be your comrade
as well as your wife. I think it is very unkind of you to keep
silent."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, Claudia, a fellow does feel a bit of an ass in
talking about a woman running after him. Spare my blushes!"</p>

<p>"It's all very well turning it into a joke, Edwin," cried the
girl, indignantly, "but it is no joke. Lady Wyke is a most
dangerous woman."</p>

<p>"Why, what harm can she do?"</p>

<p>"She can hurt my father, if her last threat is to be
believed."</p>

<p>"Ah, but is it to be believed?" questioned the young man
shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Yes it is. Lady Wyke is growing old, and, as you know, there is
no fool like an old fool. She has fallen in love with you, and will
move heaven and earth to get you as her husband."</p>

<p>Edwin frowned. "That is quite true." Then he smiled. "She has
asked me to afternoon tea."</p>

<p>"Oh, what impertinence! You won't go."</p>

<p>"I leave the decision to you, Claudia," said Craver, drily.</p>

<p>"What does she wish to see you about?"</p>

<p>"I understand from her that she will explain when I call, not
before." There was silence for quite a minute. "You had better go,
Edwin," said, Claudia, becoming more her reasonable resolute self,
and speaking decisively. "I am quite sure that Lady Wyke suspects
my father with something in connection with the death of her
husband. She may even believe that he is guilty. Perhaps I was
foolish not to stay on the cliffs and hear what she had to say. But
I was in a rage. I only wanted to hurt her, and did so by
laughing."</p>

<p>"You cut off your nose to spite your face." said Edwin, with a
shrug. "That is not like you, Claudia."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," she answered penitently. "Usually I am calm and
self-possessed when there is trouble. But Lady Wyke makes me so
angry with her insolence that I lose control of myself. How has she
persecuted you, Edwin."</p>

<p>"I told you. Nearly every day she has written to me at the
factory, saying a great deal without making clear what she really
does mean. Three or four times she has been in town, and I have had
interviews with regard to the motor she bought. This was wrong, and
that was wrong, when, as a matter of fact, nothing was wrong. Then
she wrote inviting me to take her to the theatre; she asked me to
dinner; she sent me a box of cigarettes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" Claudia was furious. "You returned the cigarettes?"</p>

<p>"Well, dear; I couldn't do that without appearing to be
rude."</p>

<p>"Then you should have been rude, very rude. She deserves
rudeness."</p>

<p>"But I refused the dinners and the theatres on the plea that I
was busy. I did not intend to see her to-day, but after her
conversation with you, I think it is just as well that she should
understand things."</p>

<p>"I agree. Tell her you intend to marry me and not her. Oh, what
a cat she is! What a persistent, spiteful cat!"</p>

<p>"She is showing her claws at any rate," said Craver, with a
shrug. "It is puzzling to know why she has taken this mad fancy to
me."</p>

<p>"It's not puzzling at all," rejoined Claudia, promptly. "I took
a fancy to you myself. You are handsome and clever and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, spare my blushes!" interrupted Edwin again, and really did
grow crimson at these crude compliments. "You make me feel an ass.
But there is no doubt," he continued seriously, "that she means
mischief with regard to your father."</p>

<p>"You don't think that he is guilty, Edwin?" faltered the girl,
wincing.</p>

<p>"No, no! Certainly he is innocent. But he was in the house when
Wyke was murdered, and Lady Wyke may try to implicate him in the
matter. Sergeant Purse isn't very clever, you know, while she is;
so she may be able to twist him, round her finger. I'd better pay
the visit, Claudia."</p>

<p>"Yes. But don't&mdash;don't&mdash;kiss&mdash;her."</p>

<p>"Claudia!"</p>

<p>"I know I'm silly," said Miss Lemby, dismally; "but she's old
and desperately in love with you. I don't say that you'll kiss
her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which you did," interpolated Edwin.</p>

<p>"But she may kiss you."</p>

<p>Very much amused, Edwin jumped up and swung Claudia to her feet,
"You are a silly child," he said fondly. "You are the only woman I
ever loved, or ever shall love. Will you come with me and keep
guard?"</p>

<p>"No!" Claudia stamped viciously, "I couldn't keep my temper. She
certainly means mischief with regard to my father, Edwin, for she
is keeping him on the string."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I mean what I say. Dad wants to marry her and get the money. He
said so. She guesses that, and is allowing him to write her silly
letters so that she may keep in touch with him. For all I know she
may ask him to dinners and theatres, as she asks you. Dad is clever
in some ways but a fool in others."</p>

<p>Craver remembered the truculent manners of the buccaneer, and
recalled his dominating personality. "I don't think Lady Wyke will
find him such a fool as she imagines. He is quite capable of
twisting her neck."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Claudia turned pale. "That sounds as though dad was
capable of stabbing Sir Hector."</p>

<p>"He didn't do that," said Edwin decisively.</p>

<p>"How can you be sure?"</p>

<p>Craver hesitated in a most unaccountable manner. "Well, it might
be the other fellow who bolted on the bicycle, you know. If there
had been any evidence against your father he would have been
arrested after the inquest."</p>

<p>"That is true," sighed Claudia, with relief, "But what does Lady
Wyke mean by her hints?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to find out. Don't worry."</p>

<p>It was all very well for Craver to give this sound advice, but
hard for the girl to take it. Usually she was sensible, but the
long continued strain on her nerves was breaking her down. Also she
was jealous of her elderly rival, who was clever, rich, and
persistent. Of course, Edwin could be trusted, still he was only a
man, and men are wax in the hands of women.</p>

<p>Claudia would have liked to go also to Maranatha in order to
protect her man from the vile machinations of Lady Wyke, but she
could not trust herself. She would be sure to say something or do
something which would give her hostess the advantage, so it was
wiser to risk nothing. Edwin went alone, and then Claudia returned
to her room to spend an uncomfortable hour or so of suspense.</p>

<p>The young man walked briskly along the road and turned into
Ladysmith Road about four o'clock. He soon arrived at the square,
red bricked mansion and paused to stare at it. Maranatha had been
greatly improved by its present tenant. The lawns were trim and
clean-shaven; the elms were clipped, and looked more civilised,
while the house itself had a more inhabited and less dismal
look.</p>

<p>Edwin nodded to himself in approval of Lady Wyke's cleaning-up
and restoration, then walked up the neat path and rang the bell.
When a sedate-looking footman introduced him into the hall he
shivered a little, at the memory of the late tragedy, but recovered
himself when shown into the drawing-room. This, was upstairs, the
very room where Oliver Lemby had been waiting on that fatal night.
But it presented quite a different appearance now from what it did
then, although the visitor did not know this. Formerly dusty and
untidy when attended to by Mrs. Vence, it was now cheerful, bright,
and comfortable. A fire was burning in the grate, there was a new
and brilliant carpet, while the old-fashioned furniture had been
renovated and polished so as to look like new. Showy coloured rugs
and draperies made the vast apartment look gay, and everywhere
there were hothouse flowers of rainbow hues. The scent of pastilles
burning in bronze vases made the atmosphere languid, indisposing
those who breathed it to transformation from gloom to brightness as
had taken place in Maranatha.</p>

<p>And the author of the transformation rose from a sofa on which
she was reclining to greet her visitor. "I am so glad to see you,"
she said softly, and he noted that her shrill voice was now low and
gentle. "I feared you would not come."</p>

<p>But Edwin was not to be taken in by her wiles, and only lightly
touched her hand outstretched in greeting. "I certainly came, Lady
Wyke," he observed, coldly, "because your letter intimated that you
wished to speak to me about something connected with the death of
your late husband."</p>

<p>"Does that interest you?" she asked, indicating a seat and
sinking down on to the sofa.</p>

<p>"Surely. You hinted to Miss Lemby that her father had something
to do with the matter, and for Miss Lemby's sake I am
interested."</p>

<p>"Can't we leave the name of that girl out of the
conversation?"</p>

<p>"I think not," said Craver, still coldly. "You forget that it is
on behalf of her father that I have come. You threatened, both in
London and on the cliffs the other day to do him harm."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Lady Wyke's brows contracted in a frown, "so that girl
told you of our conversation on the cliffs?"</p>

<p>"Yes. About an hour or so ago. In fact, the moment I arrived as
you might say, she told me everything."</p>

<p>"Everything?" repeated the woman, with emphasis.</p>

<p>Edwin nodded. "Even to the offer of one thousand a year."</p>

<p>"She should have had more sense than to say that," snapped Lady
Wyke.</p>

<p>"Don't you think that we had better leave Miss Lemby's name out
of this conversation?" said Craver, tartly.</p>

<p>"I asked you to," she reminded him swiftly, "and you
refused."</p>

<p>Craver could not deny this, and looked uncomfortable. "I have
not much time to wait, Lady Wyke," he remarked, looking at his
watch with pointed rudeness. "I must ask you to come to the
point."</p>

<p>"Oh, there is plenty of time for that," she answered sweetly.
"You must have some tea first."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I am due back to tea at the Rectory."</p>

<p>"I think not. We have much to say to one another."</p>

<p>"About Mr. Lemby?"</p>

<p>"No." Lady Wyke looked at him so pointedly that he blushed.
"About yourself."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't," he exclaimed, just like an unformed
schoolboy.</p>

<p>"You wish I wouldn't what?"</p>

<p>"Talk like that."</p>

<p>"Talk like what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we are speaking in a circle. See here, Lady Wyke. You asked
me here to say something about Mr. Lemby. I understand from your
hints to Claudia that you accuse him of murdering your
husband."</p>

<p>"How crudely you put it." She raised her eyebrows. "I don't
accuse him."</p>

<p>"Then why I am here I don't know."</p>

<p>"You will know soon, Mr. Craver. I accuse someone else."</p>

<p>"Who is it?" The young man suddenly shivered, in spite of the
warm atmosphere.</p>

<p>"Who is he, you mean. Well; then, ask yourself who murdered my
husband."</p>

<p>"I don't know. How should I know?"</p>

<p>"Because you murdered him. It was you who escaped on that
bicycle, Mr. Craver, and it was you who stabbed Sir Hector in this
very house."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_15" id=
"Chapter_15"></a>Chapter 15</b>
</h2>

<p>Lady Wyke's sudden accusation of murder came like a bolt from
the blue, and so stunned Craver that he had not a word to say.
While he sat silent in the deep armchair, as white and cold and
motionless as any corpse, she touched the bell-button and ordered
the footman who appeared to bring in tea immediately, The footman
arranged the tea-table near the fire, and Lady Wyke sat down to
attend to her hospitable duties.</p>

<p>"Sugar, Mr. Craver?" she asked, when the tea was poured out.</p>

<p>If she could be composed so could he.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Two lumps," he said, and bent forward to accept the
cup.</p>

<p>"You take it very well," said Lady Wyke, approvingly. "But then
I know you have plenty of courage. All aviators must be courageous,
and you are very successful I hear. I wonder if you would take me
for a flight one day?"</p>

<p>"Would you risk one with me?" asked Craver.</p>

<p>Lady Wyke laughed, settled herself amongst the cushions of the
sofa, and stirred her tea. "Oh, you mean that you might be inclined
to tip me out of the machine," she observed, looking at him
straightly. "Very naturally you should, seeing what I know. Still,
I am willing to risk a flight."</p>

<p>"What do you know?"</p>

<p>"I told you. I know that you murdered Sir Hector."</p>

<p>"I did not murder him," said Craver, steadily.</p>

<p>Lady Wyke shrugged her elegant shoulders. "Of course you say
that. I don't very well see what else you can say if you want to
save your neck."</p>

<p>"My neck isn't in danger."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think it is, and at my discretion."</p>

<p>"So you think."</p>

<p>"And so I believe, with every reason to believe," she retorted,
and yet looked uneasy. This calm way of taking so heinous an
accusation surprised and irritated her greatly. "Well, what have
you to say?"</p>

<p>"A great deal."</p>

<p>"Hum! I told you that you would not get back to tea at the
Rectory. After all, we are very comfortable&mdash;at least I
am."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say that I am comfortable in the presence of a
woman who stoops so low to gain her ends; but let us get down to
business."</p>

<p>"Business? You mean you wish to know why I act in this way?"</p>

<p>"Well, I have a sort of idea of your motive. Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Still, you must be blind," she interrupted, "not to see that I
am in love with you and wish to marry you."</p>

<p>"You go the right way about getting me to be your husband, I
must say," said the young man, sarcastically. "I shall love you
immensely if you succeed in leading me to the altar against my
will. Get someone else to woo you," he ended.</p>

<p>"No; I want you."</p>

<p>"You can't have me."</p>

<p>"Edwin&mdash;" she leant forward and extended her arms
imploringly "&mdash;don't be so cruel. It is not my fault that I
have fallen in love with you. The moment I met you I wished you to
become my husband. After all, I am not so old and not so ugly that
you should scorn me. Also, I am rich; I have brains&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With regard to that last," he interrupted, "I don't think you
have. Otherwise, you would scarcely proceed with your love-making
in this way."</p>

<p>"It is the man who should make love;" she panted, fiercely.</p>

<p>"I agree with you. Why, then, do you usurp the privilege of the
male sex?"</p>

<p>"I hate you!" Lady Wyke clenched her fists, as if about to
strike him, and glared viciously. "I hate you!"</p>

<p>"I prefer that," said Craver, serenely, and kept a cool eye on
her doings.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;" Lady Wyke looked up to the ceiling "&mdash;has this
man any feeling? How can he sit there and see a loving woman tear
her heart to lay it at his feet for him to trample on."</p>

<p>"Silly! Silly!" was Edwin's comment.</p>

<p>"Take care." The woman bent over him and hissed the word into
his ear. "I can hang you!"</p>

<p>"So you say," he replied, unmoved.</p>

<p>"So I say, and so I know," she shouted. "I know that you came
down to this house on the night when Hector was murdered. You
stabbed him, so that he might not marry that Lemby girl. You
escaped on the bicycle. You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop. How can you prove all this?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can prove it right enough. But I don't want to
go&mdash;to&mdash;such lengths." Lady Wyke burst into tears and
took out her handkerchief. "I wish you wouldn't force me
to&mdash;to behave in this way. Oh, my darling, I love you with all
my heart and soul, I want to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Edwin sprang up as she stumbled forward, with the idea of
throwing her arms around his neck. "Don't go on acting like a
fool," he said, sternly. "If you must talk, talk sensibly.
Otherwise I shall leave immediately."</p>

<p>"I'll send the police after you," she threatened, furiously.</p>

<p>"Do so. You'll be no nearer to gaining your object."</p>

<p>Then Lady Wyke broke down. "Oh, Edwin! Edwin! Edwin!"</p>

<p>Purposely cool and pointedly rude Craver resumed his seat,
lighted a fresh cigarette and looked at her critically. "I wouldn't
cry if I were you, Lady Wyke. You can't afford to do so at your age
without spoiling your face."</p>

<p>"Oh, you brute!"</p>

<p>"Quite so; and, knowing that I am a brute, why, try to force me
to become your husband?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know." She dabbed her eyes carefully with her
handkerchief. "Perhaps to make you smart for having treated me so
insolently. I won't give you up to that girl."</p>

<p>"There is no question of giving up. I am hers; I never was
yours. Come, Lady Wyke, don't you think we had better discuss
matters calmly."</p>

<p>"What matters?" she asked, wilfully dense.</p>

<p>"Well; the accusation, for one thing."</p>

<p>Lady Wyke did not reply. She was thinking how best to get the
better of this iceberg. Threats did not move him; passion did not
appeal to him; tears had no effect. Strange to say, the more he
held out the more she admired him. However, if she wished to gain
him against his will, and that she intended to manage, being so
infatuated, the sole thing to do was to talk business. He must be
forced to see that she had the upper hand, and if he did grasp that
fact he might yield. But even then she was not very sure of
victory.</p>

<p>"Let us talk calmly," said Lady Wyke, lighting a fresh
cigarette. "I want to marry you, and I mean to have you. That is
not an easy thing for a woman to say to the man she loves."</p>

<p>Edwin admitted this, and suggested that she should lay her cards
on the table forthwith. "Then I shall show you my hand."</p>

<p>With an ironical smile she fumbled under the cushion and
produced a letter deliberately to pass over to him. "It's a copy,"
she observed, while he read it. "You see, I can't trust you with
the original."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it is as wise not to do so. H'm!" Edwin glanced
over the four or five lines and nodded. "This is my letter to Sir
Hector saying that I was coming down to see him that night at seven
o'clock. I wrote this letter&mdash;the original one, I
mean&mdash;in answer to one which your husband wrote me asking me
to call. How did you get the original of this?"</p>

<p>"From Neddy Mellin, my nephew. He took the letter from the hall
table, where it had been left by the postman on that night. He did
not show it to his mother, as he is clever, and hoped to get money
for it."</p>

<p>"He read it, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. The boy is far in advance of his years, and knows a
thing or two. He guessed that you were guilty, since the letter
said that you were calling to see Sir Hector. However, Neddy gave
the letter to me, thinking I could get some money for it for him. I
told him to hold his tongue, and, lest he should not, I sent him to
London. He is quite safe. Well, now, Mr. Craver, do you deny that
you were in his house on that night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Edwin, smoothly. "I came before my letter
arrived, it seems, as Hall brought it while I was in the house.
Wyke wished to see me with regard to his discovery that you were
alive. He told me that he could not marry Claudia, because you had
turned up. But he loved Claudia, and not being able to marry her
thought he would make her happy by giving her to me."</p>

<p>"He could, not help himself," said Lady Wyke, tartly.</p>

<p>"So he said. He heard my ring at the door, and came down to the
study, leaving Lemby in the drawing-room. Wyke told me that he
hated you, and did not intend that you should have his fortune. He
intended, so he said, to make a new will, leaving the five thousand
a year to me, on condition that I should marry Claudia. I agreed,
and he took me out of the study into the dining-room adjoining to
show me some notes he had made for a new will."</p>

<p>"Rather strange that he should keep those notes in the
dining-room," sneered Lady Wyke, who was listening intently.</p>

<p>"It was strange. But then Wyke was not quite himself that night.
Your unexpected reappearance gave him a shock, because he hated
you. Anyhow he took me into the dining-room and showed me some
papers. Afterwards he went back to the study for other papers, and
was away for some time. I heard a cry and a fall, and after waiting
for a moment or so I went back to the study. There I saw Wyke lying
dead on the hearthrug. While I was bending over him, to see if he
was really dead, Mrs. Vence came in, dropped the tray, and fainted.
Then came the postman's knock. I lost my head, for in a flash I saw
in what a dangerous position I stood if I were discovered with the
dead man."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Lady Wyke, deliberately, "that you kept
your head very cleverly, seeing how you saved yourself."</p>

<p>"I did that on the spur of the moment. I was very much afraid,
and ran into the hall, opened the front door, and dashed down the
path. All I wanted to do was to escape being recognised by Hall.
Then I saw his bicycle leaning against the fence, and immediately
the idea came to me of escaping. I used it as you know&mdash;and as
everyone else knows. Where I rode in the fog and the gloom, I
scarcely knew; all I wanted to do was to escape. Then I found
myself on the Bethley Road, and saw the carrier's cart joggling
along with the man half asleep while driving. I jumped off the
bicycle and hoisted it on to the back of the cart, so that no one
should know where I had dropped off the machine. Sorley, the
carrier, found it, as you know, when he reached home at Waking. I
then walked back to the Bethley railway station and took the train
to town. That is the whole story, so you see that I am
innocent."</p>

<p>"You make out a very good case for yourself," she said, coolly;
"but who will believe such a story? It is known that the Lemby girl
wished to marry you, and that you hated Hector for taking her from
you."</p>

<p>"That is quite true. But I did not hate him after our interview
in the study and the dining-room. Of course, I pitied him."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course you did," scoffed the woman, "Anyhow, you are
known to have hated him as your rival, and the original letter I
hold will prove that you came down to murder him."</p>

<p>"I don't see that?"</p>

<p>"Sergeant Purse may see it."</p>

<p>"Well, then, show it to Sergeant Purse," said Craver, in
desperation.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I shall give you time to reflect. Take a week or a
fortnight. If you agree then to marry me I shall destroy the
letter. If not&mdash;" She paused and smiled.</p>

<p>"I'll take the fortnight," said Craver, heavily. "You are top
dog this time."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_16" id=

</h2>

<p>At the Rectory, dinner was always placed on the table at seven
o'clock, it being a law of the Medes and Persians that everyone
should be in time. Yet, much to Claudia's distress, Edwin did not
put in an appearance until the meal was half over. His parents were
speculating as to what could be delaying him when he entered, cool
and calm, but somewhat pale. With an apology for his late arrival,
and for not having changed his dress, he sat down to cool soup and
lukewarm fish.</p>

<p>Mrs. Craver felt annoyed, and said that she was. "Why did Lady
Wyke keep you such a long time?" she asked, indignantly. "It was
most inconsiderate of her. But, there, you can't expect manners
from a person of that class."</p>

<p>"She did not keep me, mother," answered, Edwin, without raising
his eyes, "for I left Maranatha some time ago, and have been
walking about ever since thinking things over in detail."</p>

<p>"What things?" asked the Rector, curiously, and Claudia's eyes
mutely put the same question.</p>

<p>"Those concerned with the murder of her husband."</p>

<p>"Then she did wish to see you about that crime?" said Mrs.
Craver, sharply.</p>

<p>Edwin nodded. "She appears to have a good opinion of my
qualities as a detective and asked me to help her to discover the
truth."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure! And what next? As if you were in a position to
waste your time attending to that business."</p>

<p>"Well, mother, I nave promised to do so. After all, Lady Wyke is
a widow, and has no one to help her. Also, on behalf of the firm,
since she is a good customer, it is policy on my part to keep in
with her."</p>

<p>"I don't see that, Edwin," observed the Rector, shrewdly. "After
all, you are an engineer, and not a detective."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean to say that I am going to give up the
substance for the shadow," said Edwin, cheerfully; "that is, I
don't intend to leave my business to start on what may prove to be
a wild-goose chase. But, between times, and when I have an
unoccupied minute or so, it is easy for me to look round. And I
think you are rather hard on Lady Wyke, mother. She isn't at all a
bad sort."</p>

<p>Mrs. Craver sniffed and straightened her spare figure. "I don't
like the woman."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Edwin, with the air of a man closing a
discussion, "I have given her my promise to look into things, and I
must keep it. For that reason, I have not changed my clothes,
mother. I have to return to town to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, Edwin!" cried Claudia, with dismay and with some reproach.
"Can't you stay until Monday?"</p>

<p>"Not if I have to keep my promise to Lady Wyke."</p>

<p>"Well, Edwin&mdash;" Mrs. Craver stood up to go "&mdash;a promise
is a promise, and you must not break your word."</p>

<p>After the dinner was finished, the young couple were left alone,
and Edwin poured himself out a glass of port wine, which he felt
sadly in need of. Claudia said nothing, but watched her lover
carefully.</p>

<p>"I hate telling lies, in any case," said Craver, abruptly, "but
it is particularly difficult with regard to my own parents. Yet I
can do nothing else."</p>

<p>"You can tell the truth to me," suggested Claudia, quietly.</p>

<p>"I intend to. We won't be interrupted for at least fifteen
minutes, so we can talk without arousing the suspicions of father
and mother."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Can't you guess after what I have said, Claudia? I lulled my
mother's suspicions regarding a possible flirtation of Lady Wyke
with me by telling a lie; and I said that it was Christianity to
help the poor widow&mdash;hang her!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" Claudia started and winced. "So she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly. Her flirtation is more serious than ever. She wants to
marry me and asked me to tea so that she might put the case
plainly."</p>

<p>"She can't force you to marry her, Edwin?"</p>

<p>"She'll try to; and there is no doubt that she has me on
toast."</p>

<p>Claudia rose from her chair, and came round the table to sit
beside him. "Do you mean to say that she can implicate my father in
the crime, and demand your hand as a promise of silence?"</p>

<p>"No. I mean to say that she can drag me into the matter."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" Claudia stared aghast. "What have you to do with
the death?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; and Lady Wyke knows as much. All the same, she can
make things very unpleasant for me, and will, unless I give you up
and marry her."</p>

<p>Claudia looked puzzled. "But how can she?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, dear." He took her hand and drew her to him. "Do
you remember the letter which Hall, the postman, delivered that
night?"</p>

<p>"Yes. My father told me something about it, although it was not
mentioned at the inquest."</p>

<p>"Luckily for me it was not."</p>

<p>"Why? Oh, why?"</p>

<p>"Because I wrote it."</p>

<p>"You. And to Sir Hector?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Wyke wrote asking me to go down and see him at Maranatha
privately. I replied, saying that I would, and fixed the time. But,
owing to the lateness of the post, I arrived before my letter did.
Hall brought it, and left it on the table in the hall. It
disappeared, and Lady Wyke told me that Neddy Mellin took it when
he came with the washing just after the crime was committed. What
his object was, I can't say, although Lady Wyke hinted that he
desired to get money. However, the boy read the letter, and knew
that I was coming to the house. I can't say if he thought that I
had already arrived, and was the man who escaped on the bicycle.
Lady Wyke got that letter from Neddy, and made him promise to hold
his tongue. She sent him to London so as to get him out of the way.
She now holds my letter making the appointment, and threatens to
show it to Sergeant Purse if I don't throw you over."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Claudia stared straight in front of her, pale and
dismayed. "It is very terrible, and very complicated. Why did Sir
Hector write to you?" Craver told her rapidly and without further
preamble. Thus, Claudia learnt how the dead man intended to leave
his money to Edwin, and how he hated his wife. "It was to prevent
her finding out his intentions regarding the disposal of his
property that he asked me to come secretly to Maranatha," finished
Edwin, quietly. "I did so."</p>

<p>"No one saw you; no one recognised you?"</p>

<p>"No one. I was muffled up in a heavy top-coat when I got to
Redleigh Station, and pulled my cap over my eyes so that the
station-master and the porters should not recognise, me. They did
not, and then I walked to Hedgerton to enter that accursed house,
and&mdash;well you know the rest."</p>

<p>"But how did you escape?"</p>

<p>This also Craver told her, and shortly Claudia was in possession
of the whole terrible story. Of course, she immediately saw in what
peril her lover stood, and how easily Lady Wyke could have him
arrested. "Oh, what is to be done?" she wailed, clasping her
hands.</p>

<p>"The first thing to be done is for you and me to keep cool. The
second is to prevent father and mother knowing anything that we
know. For that reason I was obliged to tell lies, much as I dislike
doing so. The third thing, to be done is for me to go to London
to-night and see your father at Tenby Mansions the first thing in
the morning."</p>

<p>"What good will that do?"</p>

<p>"Your father was in the house, and may know something of
moment."</p>

<p>"You believe that he may be able to prove your innocence?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. He was in the drawing-room sure enough; but I
can't believe that a man of your father's restless disposition
would stay quietly there. I believe that he came down the stairs
and saw&mdash;saw&mdash;" Edwin hesitated.</p>

<p>"Saw what?" asked Claudia, faintly.</p>

<p>"Saw who murdered Wyke."</p>

<p>"But who could have done so. Surely you don't believe that dad
is guilty?"</p>

<p>"No. Certainly I don't."</p>

<p>"And you are innocent also?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"Then there was only Mrs. Vence in the house. Do you think that
she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Craver, decisively. "She had every reason to keep him
alive, and no reason at all to wish him dead. She didn't strike the
blow. Who did I can't say. I'm going to find out. Now you see,
Claudia, why I told my father and mother that I wished to assist
Lady Wyke. I must assist her, as otherwise I shall be put in gaol
on a charge of murder."</p>

<p>"She would never do that," exclaimed Claudia, flushing
angrily.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed she would. The woman is a perfect nuisance, and,
although I was as rude as possible to her, she would not sheer
off."</p>

<p>"If I gave you up would she let you have that letter and hold
her tongue?"</p>

<p>"She says she would," was Edwin's cautious reply, as he rose and
glanced at his watch. "Anyhow, I have a fortnight to think over
things. In order to get the better of Lady Wyke and clear my
character I'm off to-night to begin my search for the true
assassin. Come to the gate and see me off, Claudia."</p>

<p>Neither the Rector nor his wife really learnt why Edwin took so
abrupt a departure. He made his apologies anew, shook hands with
his father and kissed his mother. Mrs. Craver accorded him a rather
chilly forgiveness, and remarked that he could not be so very fond
of Claudia, seeing that he preferred to leave her and go about
Laura Bright's business. However, Edwin laughed her into a better
humour, and then went off to Redleigh, on his motorcycle, to catch
the nine o'clock train to town.</p>

<p>The Rectory was very dull after this untoward departure. Mrs.
Craver being upset, retired early to bed, and insisted that her
husband should come likewise. As he had to rise for an early
celebration next morning, he was not averse to doing what she
asked, and the old couple were safely tucked in by ten o'clock.
Claudia, left alone, read a book for a time, but was unable to fix
her attention on the story, as she was actually living a much more
exciting one. Then she saw that the servants were all in bed, and
retired herself in the hope of getting to sleep. Only in that way
could she forget her troubles. But she woo'd sleep in vain; she
tossed and turned restlessly for quite thirty minutes. At the end
of that time she took a sudden resolution, and rose to dress
herself. It was not yet so late but what Lady Wyke might still be
up and about, so Claudia decided to call and see her. Considering
the primitive habits of Hedgerton, the project was rather a mad
one. Still, strong diseases require strong remedies, and in a very
short time Claudia, with the latch-key in her pocket, had slipped
out of the dark Rectory, and was on her way to Maranatha.</p>

<p>It was a bright, star-lit night, although there was no moon, and
the girl walked swiftly along the Esplanade towards Ladysmith Road.
Luckily, she met no one, not even Jervis, the policeman, as his
attentions on Saturday night were always given to the village in
the hollow. Claudia boldly rang the bell, and when the footman
appeared, sent in her card. The man seemed rather astonished at so
late a visitor, but took up the card to his mistress, and shortly
returned with the information that Lady Wyke would be pleased to
see Miss Lemby.</p>

<p>Claudia followed the servant up the stairs; she was ushered into
the drawing-room, and the door was shut behind her. So here she was
in the lion's den, alone and unsupported.</p>

<p>"This is a pleasant surprise, Miss Lemby," said Lady Wyke,
moving forward with outstretched hands. "Do tell me why you have
come to see me at this hour?" Claudia rejected the outstretched
hands, and, folding her own, spoke sternly to the point. "I have
come to give up Edwin to you," she said, calmly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Lady Wyke laughed shrilly. "On what condition?"</p>

<p>"On condition that you save his life!"</p>

<p>"I accept!" said Lady Wyke. "His life is safe when he becomes my
husband."</p>

</h2>

<p>After the excitement of the evening and her swift walk in the
keen air at so late an hour, Claudia felt faint. Nor did the
languid atmosphere of the tropical drawing-room tend to restore
her. The heat of the large fire, the brilliance of the many lights,
the multiplicity of colours, and the odour of flowers mixed with
the scent of the burning pastilles, all made her sense reel and her
eye grow dim. With a violent effort she cleared her head of
vapours, and became as composed as formerly she had been agitated.
Lady Wyke was pleased.</p>

<p>"You are worth fighting, Miss Lemby." she said, approvingly.</p>

<p>"Thank you for the compliment," retorted Claudia, sitting bolt
upright with a stern white face and steady eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's no compliment," trilled Lady Wyke, like a bird, "it is
the truth. If you were a namby-pamby of the weeping kind I should
despise you. As it is, I respect you immensely. Few girls of your
age would act so sensibly."</p>

<p>"I am acting sensibly, as you call it, because I see no other
way in which to act. But although I have yielded for the moment,
Lady Wyke, don't think that I have given up all hope of regaining
Edwin. That Edwin will be my husband is a foregone conclusion.
Aren't you ashamed to get a husband on such terms?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said Lady Wyke, coolly. "He doesn't love me now,
but he will learn to love me. I suppose he is annoyed at you
throwing him over."</p>

<p>"I haven't told him," retorted Claudia, curtly. "He has gone to
town."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Lady Wyke started and looked suspiciously at her
visitor.</p>

<p>"I know that you can implicate Edwin in the murder by showing
that letter to Sergeant Purse," said Claudia, steadily. "All the
same you know that he is guiltless."</p>

<p>"Do I? Then who is guilty?"</p>

<p>"I can't say."</p>

<p>"Your father?" asked Lady Wyke, impertinently and with
meaning.</p>

<p>"No!" Claudia started to her feet. "My father would never stab
an old man."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think he would to get money," retorted the hostess,
leaning back in her chair and smiling. "He is very much the man who
would slay and stab in order to get money. And from all accounts he
needs money very badly."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think he does," said Claudia, coolly, "else he would
scarcely have thought of marrying you."</p>

<p>The shot told, and Lady Wyke grew angry. "Look here, Miss Lemby,
I am scrupulously polite to you, and I expect politeness in return.
If you have nothing more to say you had better go."</p>

<p>"Oh! I have ever so much more to say. I will go when it suits
me."</p>

<p>"You defy me," cried Lady Wyke.</p>

<p>"I do. I have given in over one thing because I can't help
myself. I am not going to give in over the question of staying or
going. After we have had an explanation, it is just on the cards
that I may rescind my surrender."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed. Well, Miss Lemby, as it seems we are to have a
talk, let me offer you some refreshment. There is wine on yonder
table."</p>

<p>"No, thanks."</p>

<p>"Well; then, go on; what have you to say?"</p>

<p>"This. That Edwin is innocent."</p>

<p>"Prove it," said Lady Wyke.</p>

<p>"Edwin has told me everything," pursued Claudia. "He came down
here in answer to a letter from your husband inviting him to an
interview."</p>

<p>"Quite correct. The letter I hold is written in answer to one
sent by Sir Hector."</p>

<p>"Very good," remarked Miss Lemby, "we are agreed so far. Well,
then, Edwin told you, I presume, why Sir Hector wished to see
him?"</p>

<p>Lady Wyke nodded. "Yes. I appeared and spoilt Hector's plan to
marry you. He knew that he had made a will years ago leaving his
property to me, and, as he hated me like poison he wished to make
another will. He would have done so after marriage, had you become
his wife, since he could not make it before the ceremony. But as I
prevented the marriage, and Hector did not wish to see me benefit
in any way, he proposed to make Edwin his heir on condition that he
married you."</p>

<p>"I take it, then, that the will was not made when Edwin came
here."</p>

<p>"No. What are you getting at? Do you mean to say that there is a
will, and that I have destroyed it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. But I merely point out that as no will was made Edwin
had no reason to murder Sir Hector."</p>

<p>"He murdered him because he did not wish Hector to marry
you."</p>

<p>"You forget," said Claudia, coolly. "Your reappearance prevented
Sir Hector from making me his wife. Edwin had no reason to fear the
prevention of his marriage with me from that quarter. And as Sir
Hector wished to make a will in Edwin's favour, Edwin would
scarcely have been such a fool as to murder the man and spoil the
chance of his getting five thousand a year."</p>

<p>"I think you should have been a lawyer, Miss Lemby; you argue so
well."</p>

<p>"Thank you. But I should like to know, what you think of the
case as I have put it? You must see that Edwin had no reason to
murder Sir Hector."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see that!" sneered Lady Wyke, crossly. "The question is,
would a jury see it?"</p>

<p>"I think so. Absence of motive for the commission of a crime
goes a long way towards proving the innocence or an accused person.
And remember all the evidence is purely circumstantial."</p>

<p>"Circumstantial or not, I have the whip hand, and I mean to use
the whip."</p>

<p>"And I mean to try and get my lover as you are trying to
do."</p>

<p>"As I have done," gasped Lady Wyke with fury. "He is mine! He is
mine!"</p>

<p>"Not yet! Oh, you thought I was in earnest when I surrendered
him to you." Claudia laughed insultingly. "What a fool you are. I
have been, bluffing you all along, you silly creature."</p>

<p>This series of insults made Lady Wyke lose her temper
altogether, and she became the fisherman's daughter straight away.
She rushed across the room to throw herself on Claudia and scratch
her eyes out; but Miss Lemby was prepared for the onset, and
immediately grabbed her hands so that she could not use them. Being
much the stronger of the two, she forced Lady Wyke over to the
chair she had risen from and made her sit down. Claudia was silent
herself, but Lady Wyke screamed so loudly that it was a wonder the
servants did not come up to see what was the matter. Lady Wyke bit
and twisted; and cried and writhed; but Claudia held her down
firmly in the chair until she was exhausted.</p>

<p>"I think you will be quiet now, said Claudia, suddenly, as Lady
Wyke became weak, ceased to kick, and began to sob.</p>

<p>"I'd like to kill you," wept the beaten woman, crying her heart
out.</p>

<p>"I daresay you would, if you had a knife or a pistol." jeered
Claudia, who was panting with her exertions; "but as you have only
your hands, and I am ever so much stronger than you are, it is just
as well that you have given in."</p>

<p>"I haven't given in, you common, vulgar creature," snarled Lady
Wyke. "I intend to marry Edwin in a month."</p>

<p>"You won't. He marries me."</p>

<p>"You have surrendered him to me to save his life."</p>

<p>"Oh no, I haven't. I have been bluffing you, as I said. Edwin's
life is quite safe from you, Lady Wyke."</p>

<p>"Is it, when I have that letter?"</p>

<p>"I defy you to produce that letter." retorted Claudia, arranging
the veil round her head, and looking in the mirror over the
fireplace. "If you do, there will be trouble. Edwin has a good
defence, as I have proved to you. No jury would convict him when no
reason can be shown for the commission of the crime of which you
accuse him."</p>

<p>"He ran away; he ran away," panted Lady Wyke, who felt her
defeat sorely and physically.</p>

<p>"I daresay he did, because he lost his head for the moment. But
he has found it now, remember."</p>

<p>"I shall see Sergeant Purse to-morrow and show him that letter,"
said the hostess, viciously, and stood up to smooth her ruffled
plumes at the mirror as her rival had done.</p>

<p>"Well, do so. You won't get Edwin in that way?"</p>

<p>"We'll see."</p>

<p>"Yes. We'll see. Good-bye, Lady Wyke, you'd better go to bed. I
shan't detain you any longer," and Claudia moved majestically
towards the door.</p>

<p>"Wait, I won't show that letter."</p>

<p>"That's your affair, and not mine."</p>

<p>"But," said Lady Wyke, with an evil smile, "I shall make it my
business to discover how your father murdered Hector."</p>

<p>"That will be difficult. He had no reason to murder him," so
Claudia said, but she winced for all that at the threat.</p>

<p>Lady Wyke saw her wincing, and regained a little of her former
dominance. "Yes, he had. Hector was going to leave the money to
Edwin, and your father knows that Edwin wouldn't have given him a
shilling."</p>

<p>"He would have given me a shilling, and I would have given it to
father. I know you are trying hard to make me surrender, Lady Wyke,
but it won't do. Edwin has gone to London to see my father and make
things straight."</p>

<p>"He can't, he can't!"</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen. I defy you."</p>

<p>"I hear you," Lady Wyke burst out into a shrill laughter. "You
defy me, do you. Well, then I shall hang your father and marry
Edwin and see you ruined."</p>

<p>"Oh, so you admit that Edwin is innocent," cried Claudia,
seizing this admission.</p>

<p>"I admit nothing, I shall act."</p>

<p>"Act as soon as you please." Claudia opened the door.
"Good-night, Lady Wyke."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_18" id=

</h2>

<p>Having, reduced her enemy to impotence, Claudia returned to the
Rectory, and slept the sleep of the just. But her slumber was due
rather to exhaustion than to placidity of mind; and on waking in
the morning, she began to realise that she had acted rather rashly.
Impulsively the girl had sought out her enemy, and impulsively, had
carried the war into the same enemy's camp. But had she been wise
in thus driving Lady Wyke into a corner? Sir Hector's widow was
clever, persistent, and dangerous, so that Claudia had no mean
antagonist to deal with. Enraged by an ignominious defeat, Lady
Wyke might see Purse and ruin Edwin without further delay. It was
possible, if not quite probable, that she would act in this way;
and Claudia went, down to breakfast, wishing fervently that the
record of the previous night could be obliterated. The girl
recognised that she had been in too much of a hurry to right the
wrong.</p>

<p>All Sunday Claudia was worried and anxious, both in church and
out of church, before meals, during meals, and after meals. Of
course, since the Rector and his wife were to be kept in the dark,
she had to feign a cheerfulness which she was a long way from
feeling. Even sharp Mrs. Craver noticed nothing in the girl's
manner likely to suggest questions, and privately thought that if
Claudia was quieter than usual it was because Edwin had gone back
to London so abruptly. Lady Wyke did not come either to the morning
or evening service, and the Rector's wife speculated as to why she
was absent.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Claudia found it impossible to remain at home,
so she went for a brisk walk along the cliffs. Emerging from the
Rectory grounds she passed through a small wood, which sheltered
the house from the sea breezes, and took the meandering path along
the verge of the cliffs. On arriving at the coastguard station she
paused for a quarter of an hour to remove her hat and let the air
breathe its cool kiss on her locks. She had a headache, caused by
her perplexity and the peace around did it good, soothing the
lingering pain and finally taking it away altogether. Claudia set
out on her return journey feeling much better, and began to think
that she was making a mountain out of a molehill. But before she
quite made up her mind to this course she suddenly came across
Neddy Mellin.</p>

<p>The boy was descending the zig-zag path which led to the beach
immediately below the Rectory, and, not being far distant, Claudia
recognised him at once. She then remembered, how Neddy had stolen
the fatal letter which implicated Edwin in the crime, and forthwith
resolved to ask questions. It required some diplomacy to ask the
right ones, so as to get right answers, for Master Mellin was a
clever brat, extraordinary sharp and suspicious. However, Claudia
thought that she could manage him, and, to attract his attention,
raised her voice in the Australian "Cooee!" Neddy turned his head
and halted when he saw her coming down the path. He liked Miss
Lemby, as she was a "very scrumptious gal&mdash;" his own
words&mdash;and, moreover, had given him a packet of cigarettes,
which was wrong of Claudia, considering the boy's tender years.
Neddy looked uncommonly smart in an Eton suit, which suited his
slim, well-knit figure perfectly. Decidedly, he was a handsome lad,
so angelic in appearance, that she wondered how he managed to keep
his shady character out of his face. Neddy was an unscrupulous
little wretch, he stopped at nothing to get his own way and his own
enjoyment, thereby greatly resembling his elders.</p>

<p>"You do look smart, Neddy," said Claudia, when she reached the
boy. "Why are you not in London?"</p>

<p>"I came down to see mother," said Neddy, whose diction, as the
listener noted, was much improved, even in the short time he had
been under tuition. "She always wants to see me every week, so that
she may know that I am safe. Coming down on to the beach,
miss?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I am out for a walk. I have not been down this way
before."</p>

<p>"It's just as well, miss," said Neddy, sagely, and led the way
down to the sands. "This place here is dangerous."</p>

<p>"Dangerous!" Claudia looked, at the billowy sand-mounds.</p>

<p>"Yes. See," and Neddy pointed to a distant patch of glistening
sand, which looked oozy and damp and treacherous. "Quicksands,
miss."</p>

<p>Claudia stared and shivered. "What a nasty-looking place."</p>

<p>"Aye, and it is nasty, too, miss. Folks have told me again and
again how other folk have been swallowed up yonder."</p>

<p>"There should be a sign that it is dangerous."</p>

<p>"There was a sign," chuckled Neddy, "but it was swallowed up
also, if you or me got in there," he added, fixing his innocent
blue eyes on the gleaming expanse, "we'd go down to hell."</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that, you horrid little boy."</p>

<p>"I'm not little, though I may be horrid, miss. I'm grown up, I
am, and next week I sing at the Tit-Bits, Music-Hall. 'Sally in our
Alley's' what I'm going to sing. The chap as teaches me says I'll
make a hit. It's good pay, too, miss, I do say. But
there&mdash;" Neddy's face fell&mdash;"I've got to hand over the
dibs to my blessed mother."</p>

<p>"Why do you speak of your mother in that way?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't call her my cussed mother, can I miss?"</p>

<p>Claudia laughed, and then became grave to rebuke him. "You are a
wicked boy to talk of your mother in that way. It is just as well
that she should get your salary. You are too young to know the
value of money."</p>

<p>"Oh, am I? Well, that's a good one. May I smoke?"</p>

<p>Claudia laughed again at this politeness, and sat down on a
convenient boulder. "You shouldn't smoke at your age."</p>

<p>"Who gave me cigarettes?" asked Neddy, shyly.</p>

<p>"I was very wrong to encourage you. I don't think," added
Claudia, with a view to arriving at the point she aimed at, "that
your aunt would give you tobacco."</p>

<p>Neddy sat down and lighted up with the impudent air of a robin.
"I take it," he remarked, coolly, "she smokes herself, and I sneak
what I want. Aunt Laura ain't bad. A dashing sort of woman, ain't
she?"</p>

<p>"She'd box your ears if she heard you say that, Neddy."</p>

<p>"She wouldn't. Aunt Laura daren't lay a finger on me."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Claudia became aware that there was a threat hidden
here.</p>

<p>"Because I know&mdash;" Neddy hesitated, and stole a cunning
glance at his companion. "Well, I know what I know."</p>

<p>"Lady Wyke has been very kind to you, Neddy."</p>

<p>"Kind? Oh, yes, very kind," Neddy sneered, and then smiled
blandly.</p>

<p>"You're a wicked little boy, you know, to steal letters."</p>

<p>Master Mellin dropped his cigarette and looked startled. "She
told you?"</p>

<p>Claudia nodded. "Yes. She wants&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You needn't talk." Neddy waved his hand grandly. "I know. Aunt
Laura wants to marry the nut you're sweet on. I twigged that ages
ago. She didn't know how to manage to nab him, so I helped
her."</p>

<p>"By giving her that letter?"</p>

<p>Neddy nodded in his turn. "I read it, you know miss," and he
leered so significantly that Claudia looked upon him as the leading
pupil in Mr. Fagin's evil Academy. "I'm rather sorry I did," went
on Neddy, "as the nut belongs to you, but only in that way could I
make the old gal help me."</p>

<p>"You unscrupulous little animal!" burst out Claudia, positively
afraid of the lad's shrewdness. "You have made a lot of
mischief."</p>

<p>"I could have made more, miss. 'Spose I'd given that letter to
old Purse?"</p>

<p>Claudia shivered, and saw the necessity of propitiating him.
"You didn't do that, I am glad to say."</p>

<p>"No. 'Cause I like Mr. Craver. He's a good sort, and has
promised to give me a ride in his aeroplane."</p>

<p>"Why did you steal the letter at all?" asked Claudia,
nervously.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I arrived just when that old cove was
slaughtered. Old Mrs. Vence, she wouldn't let me see the corpse as
much as I wanted to, so I nicked the letter lying on the hall table
just to punish her. You see, if the letter was missing I guessed
she'd get beans. When she did I intended to bring the letter
back."</p>

<p>"But she didn't get beans as you call it."</p>

<p>"No. Rum thing, as nothing was said about that letter, miss.
Well, then, when I saw that nothing was asked at the inquest, I
opened the letter and read it. I'm fly enough to know as it meant
Mr. Craver was in the house when the old cove died, seeing the
letter said as he was coming. But I didn't go for to say a thing,
knowing Mr. Craver ain't at all a bad sort, nor his pa and ma
either. I stowed away the letter, telling no one, not even mother,
and only showed it to Aunt Laura when she was sweet on Mr.
Craver."</p>

<p>"You might have thought of me, Neddy."</p>

<p>"Didn't know you then, though it was Hedgerton talk as you were
going to marry Mr. Craver. Aunt Laura she got the letter before you
came down. When you came and were nice to me and gave me
cigarettes. I was sorry. But don't you be afeared, miss. Mr. Craver
didn't do it."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Claudia, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's tellings." Master Mellin winked.</p>

<p>"I shall ask Sergeant Purse to make you say what you mean!"
cried Claudia.</p>

<p>Neddy laughed. "Then all about the letter will come out, and Mr.
Craver will be put in chokey. There ain't no sense, in that."</p>

<p>"Do you know the truth?"</p>

<p>"No." Neddy looked innocently surprised. "How should I know the
truth? I only come to Maranatha just after the old cove had been
murdered. But I'm uncommonly certain as Mr. Craver hadn't no hand
in the business."</p>

<p>"Can you help me to prove that?" pleaded Claudia, who saw very
well that the boy was a valuable witness if dealt with
diplomatically.</p>

<p>"I can give you a tip," said Neddy, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Give it to me, then."</p>

<p>"Go and ask Sergeant Purse to show you the knife as was
used."</p>

<p>"What good will that do?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Master Mellin, shrewdly, "it seems to me, though,
I'm only a boy, as Sergeant Purse ought to hunt for the cove as
owns that knife. It was sticking in the heart of the old cove you
know, and the sergeant has it. I saw it at the inquest, and it
don't seem to be the kind of knife Mr. Craver would use, nohow. Mr.
Craver, he cut on Hall's bike; but the cove as did the trick, miss,
cleared out in another way."</p>

<p>Claudia asked further questions, and received evasive answers.
Master Mellin evidently had said all that he intended to say at the
moment, so there was little use in prolonging the conversation.
Along with the boy, Claudia climbed up the path again, and left
Neddy again at the Rectory gate. In a most polite way, he lifted
his straw hat in farewell; but she detained him for a few minutes,
in the hope of getting him to say more. He smiled like an angel,
shook his head like an old man, and resolutely refused to open his
mouth. There was nothing for it but to let him go, which Claudia
did.</p>

<p>All the same, his hint about the knife dwelt in her memory. It
was indeed, strange, that the police authorities had not followed
up this important clue. Without doubt, if the knife was a peculiar
one, which Neddy hinted, its owner might be discovered; and once he
was found, then the truth would become known. Miss Lemby retired to
bed on that night resolved to see Sergeant Purse on the morrow and
learn what she could. Having been engaged to Sir Hector, there was
ample excuse for her to ask questions. In the anxiety and interest
caused by Neddy's conversation Claudia quite forgot her tussle with
Lady Wyke, and passed a better night in consequence.</p>

<p>By three o'clock next day she found herself standing with her
bicycle before the door of the Redleigh Police-office, and entered
to ask for the sergeant. Luck stood her friend, for the sergeant,
usually out on his rounds, happened to be in and disengaged.
Claudia was admitted into the sanctum of the official, and was
amiably received by the foxy-faced little man. As usual, he was as
dry as a mummy in his looks, and his eyes were more than ever like
those of a rat. He was uncommonly polite to Miss Lemby, since he
knew her story, and was sorry for her.</p>

<p>"I hope you've got over it, miss," said the sergeant, placing a
chair for his visitor. "It was a hot time for you, that same
murder."</p>

<p>"I am getting over it," Claudia assured him with a faint smile.
"And it was a very painful time as I respected Sir Hector."</p>

<p>"I don't think he behaved very well, Miss Lemby."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think he did. After all, sergeant, he did not know that
his wife was alive, you know. It was all a mistake. But I have
called to ask if you have a clue to the assassin?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Lemby. I quite understand why you should come and ask,
as naturally, you'd like to see the villain hanged. Lady Wyke would
like to see it also. I can't catch him, however. He went off on
that bicycle, and vanished into thin air, like those witches in the
play."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Purse. I have been thinking over the matter," said
Claudia, with diplomatic frankness, "and it occurred to me that you
should follow the clue of the knife. You have it, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Sergeant Purse rose and went to a shelf at the
further end of his office to fumble there, "but I don't see, how we
can follow that clue."</p>

<p>"Why not? Someone told me that the knife was a peculiar one.
Can't you trace it to the shop where it was bought?"</p>

<p>"It's an idea certainly, Miss Lemby," said Purse, returning with
a parcel in his hand. "Look at the knife yourself. It is a peculiar
one."</p>

<p>He untied a string and unrolled several sheets of paper. Then
Claudia saw a sailors clasp-knife with a handle of black bone
decorated with three broad stripes of inlaid silver. "This is the
knife, Miss Lemby." said the officer. Claudia gasped and felt
herself grow faint. The knife belonged to her father.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_19" id=
"Chapter_19"></a>Chapter 19</b>
</h2>

<p>How Claudia managed to leave the office of Sergeant Purse and
reach home she never clearly knew. In some extraordinary way she
contrived to keep from fainting and maintain her composure, so that
the officer suspected nothing. After a time she complained that the
room was close, and she felt that the fresh air would do her good.
Purse, quite ignorant of the true cause of this unexpected
nervousness, accompanied her outside and helped her to mount her
bicycle in a most amiable way. As she rode off he thanked her for
the suggestion she had made, and declared his intention of
following the clue of the knife. All the way to Hedgerton Claudia
thought over what she had done, and reached the Rectory in quite a
fainting condition. Little Mrs. Craver met her at the door and
ascribed her pale looks and nerveless limbs to the long ride.
Claudia gladly accepted the excuse and the scolding and the order
that she should lie down, as she wished to avert suspicion, and
also to be alone to think over matters. Never in after years did
the girl forget that next hour.</p>

<p>Lying on her bed, with her face pressed against the pillow,
Claudia kept assuring herself that she was mistaken. It was sinful
of her to suspect her father of such wickedness, and she deserved
to be punished for even thinking of such a thing. But the question
which agonised her was: What did this particular knife mean in
relation to Wyke's death? There was only one answer to the
question. The knife had been found sticking in Wyke's heart, and
the man who thrust it into that same heart was the criminal. Her
father was the man&mdash;her father was the criminal. Claudia
remained all that evening in bed, and again Mrs. Craver ascribed
the weakness to the exhausting ride on the bicycle to Redleigh.</p>

<p>All the long night she pondered and thought and reasoned, and
cried out against her reason. When the dawn came she rose and took
a cold bath, which refreshed her. There was no excuse for her to
remain in bed for the day, so Claudia, wan and haggard, went down
to breakfast. There she heard news which cheered her up.</p>

<p>"Edwin is coming here to-day in his aeroplane, my dear," said
Mr. Craver, who was reading his letters. "He will be here at two
o'clock this afternoon. What excitement this will cause in
Hedgerton."</p>

<p>"I only hope Edwin won't break his neck," cried Mrs. Craver,
wrathfully. "Oh, how foolish the rising generation is! There's
nothing to hold on by in one of these airships, and if he falls he
will be killed."</p>

<p>Naturally, the Rector, wishing to give the villagers pleasure,
did not keep the news to himself. He told his wife to tell the
servants, and the servants told everyone that came on that morning
to the Rectory. By noon the whole of Hedgerton knew that Master
Edwin was arriving in an airship, and great was the excitement.
From what the young man had said in his letter it was known that he
would alight on the cliffs, where there were vast spaces along
which the aeroplane could run when it settled down like a bird.
Consequently, long before two o'clock the coastguard station was
surrounded by crowds of people. In their anxiety to see the latest
invention of science and to witness the conquest of the air by man,
the whole population of the little village assembled on the cliffs.
Claudia came also with the Rector and Mrs. Craver, who were both
very anxious and very proud of the coming event. The girl glanced
round to see if Lady Wyke was present, but could not see her. She
did not even catch a glimpse of Neddy, and learnt later from his
mother that the boy had returned to town on the previous day.
Claudia drew a deep breath of relief at the news. She knew very
well that Neddy could be trusted to be silent; yet it was a comfort
to know that he was absent. Miss Lemby could not explain to herself
why it was a comfort; but somehow she felt more at ease without
this Puck in an Eton suit hovering round. And, as Lady Wyke was
also conspicuous by her absence, Claudia abandoned herself to the
general excitement of the coming arrival of Edwin from the
skies.</p>

<p>"I do wish Edwin would come," said Mrs. Craver again and again
as the hour drew near. "Do you think he has met with an accident,
George?"</p>

<p>"Let us hope he hasn't, my dear," answered the Rector, who was
likewise anxious. "But he is not due yet, so we have no reason to
think that anything sad has happened!"</p>

<p>"There he is! There he is!" shouted a keen-sighted coastguard,
who had a spyglass at his eye. "Yonder he comes."</p>

<p>"Where? Where? Where?" shouted everyone, much excited, and
looked north, south, east and west without seeing anything.</p>

<p>The coastguard ran with his spyglass to the Rector. "Look, sir!
Over yonder&mdash;over yonder!" and he pointed seaward.</p>

<p>With a trembling hand, the Rector adjusted the glass, then
uttered an ejaculation of thankfulness. "Yes. The aeroplane is
coming along like a great bird. Emma&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me to look, George. I am trembling all over."</p>

<p>But Claudia looked and saw a black speck growing larger as it
came nearer. In a few minutes the hum of the aeroplane was
distinctly heard, and with the naked eye everyone could see the
machine swinging towards the cliffs high in the blue. The
excitement was intense. Mrs. Craver had to be supported by Claudia,
so weak did she feel at her son soaring in space. Nearer and nearer
came the black dot, louder and louder became the burr of the
aeroplane, and finally, like a great dragonfly it swept in huge
circles over the land, and settled like a feather, running along
the ground swiftly in its impetus until willing hands laid hold of
it to bring it to a standstill. Then the crowd rushed to gather
round, to cheer, to ask questions, and to examine the first
aeroplane which had ever been in this out-of-the-way parish.</p>

<p>Mr. Craver, with his wife on his arm, pushed his way to the
front, with his usually dreamy eyes alight with excitement. "I
congratulate you, my son."</p>

<p>"Oh, Edwin! Edwin!" sobbed the usually unemotional mother, and
clasped him in her arms as he alighted from the machine. "It's
wonderful, but horrid. I know you'll be killed."</p>

<p>"I'm safe enough now, anyhow, mother," said Edwin,
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Where's Claudia?"</p>

<p>"Here," said the girl in a low voice, for she felt faint now
that the strain was over, and all her old fears began to reassert
themselves.</p>

<p>"Why, darling, what is the matter?" asked her lover,
hastily.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;that is, I'll tell you when you
come home."</p>

<p>It was not easy for the hero to reach home. He had to submit to
incessant handshaking; he had to get his aeroplane under shelter;
and it had to be attended to in other ways connected with the
engine and wide-spread wings. There was an old barn on the cliffs
which Edwin had arranged to use for his machine long ago, so it was
run into this, and the doors were closed, much to the regret of the
crowd anxious to contemplate the wonder. Edwin promised to give an
exhibition on the morrow, and then walked home with his parents and
Claudia.</p>

<p>As Mr. and Mrs. Craver were both asking questions concerning his
flight from Hendon all the way, Claudia had no opportunity of
speaking to her lover. But on arrival at the Rectory the watchful
mother gave the girl the opportunity of having a quiet moment with
Edwin. Mrs. Craver drew her husband away, saying that it was best
to leave the young people to themselves, and so the couple found
themselves in the drawing-room. Edwin at once demanded why Claudia
looked so ill, and she explained how she had bearded Lady Wyke, how
Neddy had advised her to search for the owner of the knife, and how
the sight of the knife in the Redleigh Police-office had informed
her that the owner was none other than her own father.</p>

<p>"Isn't it dreadful," Edwin? sobbed the girl, when she had
finished her breathless narrative; "but father can't have murdered
that poor old man."</p>

<p>"Of course he didn't," said Edwin, cheerfully, although he was
more startled by the news than Claudia guessed. "We shall ask for
an explanation. I am sure he will give one."</p>

<p>"You don't think he is guilty, Edwin?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't, dear. Appearances are rather against him, as they
are against me. But I am innocent, and so is your father."</p>

<p>"Did you see him in London? You went up to see him,
remember."</p>

<p>"No, I did not. He was absent when I called at Tenby
Mansions."</p>

<p>"Oh we must see him! We must see him!" cried Claudia, wringing
her hands.</p>

<p>"We shall see him together," said Craver, soothing her gently.
"Don't worry, my darling. I feel sure that everything will come out
right.</p>

<p>"But Lady Wyke?"</p>

<p>"She won't do anything. She is not sure of her ground. All the
same, Claudia, it was a risk going."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. But I wanted to hear what she knew."</p>

<p>"There is another person who knows more. We must see her,
Claudia. If anyone knows the truth of this crime, it is Mrs.
Vence."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_20" id=
"Chapter_20"></a>Chapter 20</b>
</h2>

<p>The company of Edwin was very welcome to Claudia, as she now had
an outlet for her grief. She could talk freely to him and receive
the comfort which she very greatly needed, although even his
consoling words did not entirely quieten her. Like the girl, Craver
could not bring himself to believe that the buccaneer was guilty.
There seemed nothing for it but to see the man and question him
closely.</p>

<p>Claudia therefore determined to journey to London, not only to
interview her father, but also to see Mrs. Vence. Edwin's
suggestion that the old housekeeper should be questioned struck the
girl as remarkably sensible. Mrs. Vence had been in the house when
the crime took place, and although she had given evidence with
apparent frankness at the inquest, it was just possible that she
might have withheld certain facts. If forced to speak she might say
something or suggest something likely to throw more light on the
darkness which environed the tragedy. She resolved to see the
housekeeper first and her father afterwards. What with Mrs. Vence's
story and the pirate's explanation the truth might come to
light.</p>

<p>The difficulty was to find Mrs. Vence, who had disappeared into
the unknown immediately after the inquest. Since leaving Hedgerton,
so far as was known, she had given no sign of her existence, and
Claudia wondered how the address of the old creature could be
found. Finally, she resolved to ask Mrs. Mellin when that good lady
came with the washing to the Rectory.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mellin had never seen Mrs. Vence, as Neddy had always taken
the clean linen to Maranatha and had conducted the business between
the housekeeper and the laundress. But Mrs. Mellin might have
learnt something from Neddy, who was always very inquisitive
regarding other people's affairs. It was possible that Mrs. Vence
had mentioned her destination to the boy in which case he would
certainly have repeated the information to his mother. Therefore
she waited for the coming of the washerwoman to carry out her
scheme.</p>

<p>For over a week Edwin remained in Hedgerton, and daily flew the
aeroplane over land and sea, much to the delight of the
parishioners. The spectacle attracted man, woman, and child so
greatly that there was little work done in the village during these
exciting days. They talked of northing else, and the faces were
always turned skyward to see the aeroplane skimming and rising and
sinking and falling, and generally disporting itself into space.
The Rector and his wife, seeing what command their son had over his
machine, lost much of their dread of an accident. It was mainly for
this reason that the young man brought tie aeroplane to Hedgerton,
and gave daily exhibitions of his skill. Once his parents became
used to aviation, he guessed that they would not worry over his
ascents at Hendon.</p>

<p>Claudia, of, course, never believed that any accident would
befall her lover and did not need any proof that he was a competent
pilot. It was firmly fixed in her mind that Edwin was destined to
save her father, to cut the claws of Lady Wyke, and to marry her.
Nothing would happen to him likely to prevent his carrying out this
programme, as she felt convinced. Therefore, she saw Edwin soar
without feeling the slightest anxiety, and even offered to
accompany him. But this her lover would not agree to. His nerves
were not strong enough to permit his carrying in the perilous
machine all that he valued on earth. So Claudia remained on the
ground and Edwin skimmed the clouds, both resting content in the
knowledge that everything was alright, or would be right in
future.</p>

<p>Lady Wyke had not come to see the arrival of Craver because
business had taken her to London. When she returned, a note
inviting the young man to Maranatha arrived at the Rectory, Claudia
did not wish Edwin to go, but the visit was paid all the same, as
Craver thought it was just as well to try and learn what Lady Wyke
intended to do. Claudia's interview must have enraged her, and it
was possible that she had gone to London to take steps likely to
make immediately public things best kept private. After some
discussion Miss Lemby saw that it was best Edwin should have the
interview, and accordingly, she gave him permission. So Edwin
sought Maranatha towards the end of the week; and Claudia, during
his absence, questioned Mrs. Mellin.</p>

<p>The washerwoman arrived on her usual day, and Claudia managed to
attend to the sorting of the clean linen herself. As there was no
time to be lost and the kitchen was empty for the time being,
Claudia put a point-blank question. "Do you know where Mrs. Vence
is to be found?" she-asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mellin stared. "Lor' bless my soul, miss, 'ow should I
know?"</p>

<p>"I thought Mrs. Vence might have told you where she was going
when she left Hedgerton."</p>

<p>"Well, she never did, miss. I didn't 'ave much truck with Mrs.
Vence, for Neddy took the washing to the 'ouse and brought it back
again. Never did I set eyes on that ole woman, 'cept I saw 'er in
the distance at the inquest. An' may I be so bold, miss, as to know
why you was so wishful to find 'er?"</p>

<p>Claudia was quite prepared for this leading question, and saw no
reason for making a secret of her intentions. "Well, you know, Mrs.
Mellin, I was engaged to marry Sir Hector, when it appeared that
his wife was already&mdash;I mean, still in existence."</p>

<p>"An' a good thing she turned up, miss," said Mrs. Mellin, with
dignity, "else a wicked case of bigamy would 'ave bin in the
papers, my sister Laura not bein' a lamb to lie down
quiet-like.</p>

<p>"Well, then," pursued Claudia, when she was allowed to speak, "I
naturally feel that the assassin of Sir Hector should be captured
and punished. It struck me that Mrs. Vence may know."</p>

<p>"Lor' bless me, miss, she said all she could say at the
inquest."</p>

<p>"Ah, but did she? That is what I wish to find out, Mrs. Mellin.
However if you don't know her address&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I really don't, miss," interrupted the washerwoman; "but Laura
might know."</p>

<p>"Lady Wyke?"</p>

<p>"My sister, miss. Lor to think as I should be connected with the
gentry. Long may they live in the land. Not as Laura's proud, she
'avin' proved otherwise by comin' to me, who am 'er own born
relative, an' taking Neddy in 'and. Yuss, miss. Laura might know,
as she 'unted up Mrs. Vence arter the inquest to 'ear what she'd to
say concernin' the tragidy. It ain't much use you seein' Mrs.
Vence, miss, if I may be so bold as to say so. Laura didn't find
nothin' to 'elp catch the gory villain who bolted on the bike, so I
don't expect as you'll git anythin' out of 'er."</p>

<p>"All the same if you can get the address I should be glad."</p>

<p>"I'll try my hardest, miss, Heaven bless, you," said Mrs.
Mellin, and this particular conversation ended with the entrance of
the Rector's wife, to whom the washerwoman dropped a curtsey.
Claudia, having done the best she could, went away to attend to
other work, leaving Mrs. Craver to count the washing and hear the
news. There was much to be done upstairs, as spring-cleaning was in
progress, so Claudia worked like a Trojan, both to help her
prospective mother-in-law and the aching of her own heart. While
working and giving her attention to every-day things, she could not
worry, and managed to pass the time profitably, and tolerably
easily until Edwin returned. She heard his step in the hall
immediately he opened the front door and flew down swiftly, all
agog for news.</p>

<p>"Well? Well?" she asked anxiously, and drawing him into the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>Edwin put his arm round her waist and looked at her queerly. "I
am coming in for a fortune," he observed, in an abrupt manner.</p>

<p>Claudia stared. "What do you mean? Sit down and explain."</p>

<p>Edwin sat down and did as he was told. "Lady Wyke is furious at
you, and wants to make you suffer for shaking her as you did. She
told me that she never did believe me guilty, and only said so to
annoy you and to trap me into marriage. She thought that I would
give in, and make her my wife rather than face the worst."</p>

<p>"Well, she found out when I saw her that she was mistaken," said
Claudia, tartly.</p>

<p>"Yes, she did, and now has gone on a new tack. She doesn't
intend to force me into marriage, because she cannot. But she went
to London the other day to make a will in my favour. Yes, you may
stare, Claudia, but Lady Wyke told me that if she dies I get five
thousand a year. The will is made, signed, and witnessed, and Mr.
Sandal holds it."</p>

<p>"Pouf!" said Claudia, contemptuously. "Mr. Sandal knows that the
will is wastepaper. I wonder Lady Wyke thinks you are such a fool
as to be taken in with that bluff."</p>

<p>"Is it bluff!" asked Edwin, looking puzzled. "How?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know that a will made before marriage is null
and void if the marriage takes place?"</p>

<p>"No. I never knew that. Few people do know it, I fancy."</p>

<p>"Lady Wyke believed that you were ignorant, and so has simply
been trying to bluff you into marriage with her. She has made the
will to bribe you; but she knows that if you marry her the will
becomes wastepaper. See?"</p>

<p>"I see. Anyhow, whether the will is destroyed by her or not, I
don't intend to marry her. Therefore, unless she alters the will,
it stands in my favour. Not that I want the money, Claudia."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said the girl. "However, you made Lady Wyke understand
that you would remain true to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And she made me understand that she was heartbroken, and
had done what she could to help me by making this ridiculous will.
And she won't proceed about my affair, as she sees that by so doing
she will be no closer to her goal. For the time being she intends
to remain quiet, in the hope that this business will soften
me."</p>

<p>"But you told her it wouldn't?"</p>

<p>"I did. Only she won't believe me. However, Lady Wyke is safe
for the time being, so meanwhile we can see your father and Mrs.
Vence, and get at the truth of the matter. As to the will, we
needn't think anything more about it."</p>

<p>Claudia agreed with this, and wondered that so clever a woman as
Lady Wyke was should act foolishly. Then she related the
conversation with Mrs. Mellin to Edwin, and hopefully said that the
address of Mrs. Vence would surely be forthcoming.</p>

<p>Edwin demurred. "Not if Lady Wyke has to give it," he said. "She
is not such a fool as to let you find out anything from Mrs. Vence
likely to spoil her game."</p>

<p>But the young man proved to be a false prophet, for Mrs. Mellin
arrived on that same evening with the address. It appeared that
Mrs. Vence was living in a Pimlico lodging-house, and for the time
being was out of work. Possessed of this information, Claudia
arranged to go to London next day with her lover.</p>

<p>Next morning Edwin fixed a sidecar to his motor-bicycle, and ran
Claudia into Redleigh in time to catch the ten-thirty London
express. In an hour and a-half they arrived in town. Then Edwin
went to Tenby Mansions at Earl's Court to prepare Lemby for his
daughter's visit, and Claudia took an Underground train for
Victoria, in order to seek Mrs. Vence in Pimlico. Craver wished to
come also, but Claudia insisted that he should look after her
father. It was necessary that she should see him as soon as
possible, and as the buccaneer was here, there, and everywhere, she
urged that Edwin would find him and watch him and hold him at home.
With this agreement the young people parted, Claudia promising to
be at the flat at three o clock, or a trifle later.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in finding the whereabouts of Mrs.
Vence, as the very dingy lodging-house she lived in was not far
from Victoria. A slatternly woman with a suspicious eye admitted
grudgingly that Mrs. Vence was indoors, and, after some arguing,
conducted the visitor into a dirty bedroom on the third floor. Here
sat Mrs. Vence near the window, coughing and sneezing and groaning
and moaning. Her ancient face was more withered and brown and
seamed with wrinkles than formerly, and on the whole she looked
very old and worn and disagreeable. With a shawl round her head,
and a little table covered with medicine bottles at her elbow, the
old woman sat with her back to the window, shivering with ague and
whimpering with pain. Claudia's stately beauty seemed to annoy her,
for she snarled when her visitor sat down, and they were left alone
by the slatternly landlady.</p>

<p>"I don't want fine ladies to come and see me, drat you,"
grumbled the old creature, crossly. "I'm ill with inflewinzy, I am,
and I do hope as you'll get it."</p>

<p>Claudia smiled at this amiable wish, and apologised. "I am sorry
you are ill, Mrs. Vence. But I have called&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About gitting me to look arter your house?" interrupted Mrs.
Vence. "Well, then, I can't, me being that ill as never was."</p>

<p>"No. Don't you know my name? I gave it to the landlady. Lemby
is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ho!" Mrs. Vence coughed and stared and grunted after her
scrutiny. "So you're his daughter, are you?"</p>

<p>"I am the daughter of Mr. Oliver Lemby, if you mean that," said
Claudia, with dignity, "and I have called to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ho!" Mrs. Vence coughed and for the third time. "I know why
you've called, my lady. And it 'ud hev been better if you didn't
hev called."</p>

<p>"Why?" Claudia was startled.</p>

<p>"'Cause I thought as every think was dead and done with about
that murder. I hev 'ad it on my nerves day and night, wondering if
I should speak or not."</p>

<p>"Speak?" The girl rose and turned white with emotion. "My
father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yuss," said Mrs. Vence with relish, "your dear par murdered him
sure enough."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_21" id=
"Chapter_21"></a>Chapter 21</b>
</h2>

<p>"That's a lie," said Claudia, calmly, and without rising.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vence spluttered and shook with wrath, in her rage it
seemed as though she were about to rise up and denounce her
visitor. But a fit of coughing prevented her, and by the time it
was over she felt too weak to scold. "It's the truth," she muttered
sulkily, and took a wineglassful of medicine.</p>

<p>"Prove it!"</p>

<p>Claudia, who had entered the room anxious and perturbed, was now
quite calm in asking questions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vence was patently surprised to see how quietly the girl
took the dreadful charge. "You don't seem much upset!" she croaked.
"I thought you loved that par of yours, as a gel should."</p>

<p>"I do love my father," was Miss Lemby's steady reply, "and for
that reason I decline to believe what you say."</p>

<p>"Then why come here to worrit me?" gasped the old woman,
crossly. "Ain't I got enuff to put up with at my age without silly
gels coming to tell me as I'm a liar. I can't say nothin'
else."</p>

<p>"You can; you must. My father explained his movements at the
inquest, and his testimony was accepted as exonerating him. And let
me remind you. Mrs. Vence, that at the inquest you brought no
charge against him."</p>

<p>"'Cause I warn't certain," retorted the old woman, promptly.
"'Twas a nasty case, and I didn't want to be mixed up in it more'n I
could help. I said as little as I could, and afterwards, when that
Lady Wyke come and see me&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did she come and see you?" interposed Claudia, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Don't I say she did, cuss you?" growled Mrs. Vence hoarsely.
"Of course she come and see me, to arsk if I know'd of anything
likely to show who killed her old man. I told her what I told you,
and she said as I'd better keep silent till she wanted me."</p>

<p>"She intended to accuse my father, then?"</p>

<p>"Yus. I s'pose so, when she was ready. And I thinks," added Mrs.
Vence, with a dry cough, "as she's gitting ready; for she's arsked
me down to Hedgerton at the end of the week&mdash;four days off,
that is, miss."</p>

<p>"Are you going?"</p>

<p>"How can I say. If the inflewenzy lets me. I may. It means money
in my pocket, and, not having a sitivation for months, I want
money."</p>

<p>"What have you to say?" demanded Claudia, sternly.</p>

<p>"Say? The truth!" snarled Mrs. Vence, crossly. "And don't arsk
me to say anything else, I beg, my mother having bin a Baptist and
perticler proper."</p>

<p>"What is the truth?"</p>

<p>"Well, your par was in the droring-room with the barnit when he
come, and I crep up to listen to what they was saying, as I don't
hold with folk heving secrets fro' me. I had my eye and my ear at
the keyhole time and time about."</p>

<p>"What did you hear? What did you see?"</p>

<p>"I heard my master explaining as he couldn't marry you 'cause he
was married already. Then your par guv a screech and swore awful. I
peeped in at the keyhole, and saw him take out a clasp-knife and
run at the old man. The barnit, he just laughed and waited, so your
par didn't know what to do. Then at that moment come the ring at
the door. I tumbled down the stairs and let in that gent as bolted
on the bike later."</p>

<p>"Do you know who he was?" asked Claudia, anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't, him being muffled up," growled Mrs. Vence.</p>

<p>"What happened then?" asked Claudia, quickly.</p>

<p>"What I said at the inquest. Sir Hector, he took the new gent
into his study, and told me to bring cake and wine in a quarter of
an hour. I said I was in the kitchen, but," said Mrs. Vence, with a
leer, "I wasn't there the whole time. Oh, no, bless you. I wanted
to see what it all meant!"</p>

<p>"And you listened?"</p>

<p>"I listened and looked," retorted the housekeeper, shamelessly.
"My master and the new gent talked about some will, and then the
barnit took the gent into the dining-room to show him some papers.
Then," said Mrs. Vence, earnestly, "I saw that par of yours coming
down the stairs; with the clasp-knife open in his hand, looking
savage-like. I was so feared that I ran back to the kitchen just as
I heard Sir Hector returning to the study. Then I comes in with the
cake and wine some time later, and found my master lying dead on
the rug, and the gent as bolted on the bike bending over him."</p>

<p>"And my father?" faltered Claudia, with a sinking heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, he got back up the stairs, and didn't come down until that
there postman and the police came. Clever, he was. But he didn't
know as I'd seen him coming down to stick the old man. You know,
miss, how the post come, and how the gent opened the door?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I know." Claudia rose with an effort. "All you say
sounds reasonable enough, from your point of view."</p>

<p>"It'll be the same fro' the jury's point of view," snapped Mrs.
Vence.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," cried Miss Lemby in despair. "Whatever you
may say, my father is innocent. You didn't see him strike the
blow."</p>

<p>"But he comed down the stairs with the knife," grinned the
housekeeper. "Oh, he did it right enuff&mdash;your par, I mean. I
believe that boy saw it, too."</p>

<p>"What boy? Do you mean Neddy Mellin?"</p>

<p>"Yus. He was in the house&mdash;in the kitchen with me."</p>

<p>"But he said he came with the washing later."</p>

<p>"Then he's a liar," said Mrs. Vence, morosely. "He come earlier,
and was keeping me company in the kitchen. An imp, he is; not as
you knows him, miss."</p>

<p>"I know him very well," said Claudia, secretly glad to hear that
the boy had been on the scene, as his evidence would be valuable.
"He is a great friend of mine. I shall see him and make him tell me
everything."</p>

<p>"He won't; he won't," said Mrs. Vence, hurriedly, and appeared
to be somewhat discomposed, as if she feared she had let out too
much.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he will, Mrs. Vence. I saw him the other day, and he
half-promised to tell me the truth. I'm going now."</p>

<p>"Pity you ever came," snarled the old woman, restlessly. "You're
only bringing your par to the gallers. If you speak to that imp,
he'll put a rope round the neck of your par for sure."</p>

<p>"Neddy will do nothing to harm me and mine, as he is fond of
me."</p>

<p>"Oh, is he? Then he'll hev to tell lies to save your par."</p>

<p>Claudia hesitated at the door. "I tell you what, Mrs. Vence,"
she said. "When you come to Maranatha I shall get my father and Mr.
Craver to meet you and Lady Wyke and Neddy. Then we can thresh the
matter out."</p>

<p>"You'd better bring that Sergeant Purse also," taunted Mrs.
Vence, "as he'll be on the spot to gaol that par of yours. Git on;
git out. You've worrited me with your cussed nonsense."</p>

<p>Claudia, having executed her purpose, left the woman still
coughing, and swiftly ran down the stairs. At the end of the narrow
street, and when she emerged into the main thoroughfare, she hailed
a taxi. Shortly she was driving towards Earl's Court, anxiously
considering what was best to be done. It was a very pale-faced girl
who entered the tiny drawing-room in the Tenby Mansions flat. Mr.
Oliver Lemby was there stretched at length in his favourite chair,
and smoking his big pipe. He looked unkempt and uncivilised, while
the room had a neglected look. Claudia felt as though she was
entering into the den of a bear, and the growl with which Lemby
received her aided the illusion. But that Edwin was sitting in an
adjacent chair and was ready to support her, Claudia would probably
have burst into tears over this reception. What with the wear and
tear of the last week, and the trying interview with Mrs. Vence,
her nerves were worn thin. She felt that she could not bear much
more strain on them.</p>

<p>"Well, my gal," roared The pirate, "you're making a nice hash of
things."</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that to Claudia, Lemby," said Edwin, sternly,
as the girl sank exhausted in a chair. "Don't you see she is worn
out."</p>

<p>"I shall talk to my own daughter as I please, hang you!"</p>

<p>"No you won't! Claudia is engaged to me, and I shall protect
her, let me tell you, Lemby, that your position is not so safe that
you can afford to go on in this way."</p>

<p>"My position is as safe as yours," growled the buccaneer.</p>

<p>"That isn't saying much," replied Craver, with a shrug. "I am in
a difficult position also. I have explained to you that I was in
the house."</p>

<p>"Yes; and I believe you scragged the old man."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vence says it was you, father," said Claudia, faintly.</p>

<p>Lemby rose and dashed his pipe to the ground, opening and
shutting his hands in ungovernable rage. "Where is the old wretch?"
he shouted. "Only let me get a grip of her and I'll send her to
kingdom come."</p>

<p>"Claudia, you are quite faint. Don't say another word for a few
minutes, and drink this glass of wine, it will revive you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Edwin." Claudia willingly accepted the offer and
sipped the port, while her father strode up and down the room like
a caged beast, cursing and storming, and generally conducting
himself like a wild man of the woods. Edwin sat beside Claudia and
attended to the girl, occasionally glancing at the buccaneer with a
contemptuous smile. The sight of this somewhat calmed Lemby, who
became ashamed of his want of self-control. With a final oath he
flung himself into his chair and sulkily demanded what was to be
done. Since his daughter was still too upset to speak, Edwin spoke
for her.</p>

<p>"Let us hear Claudia's report of her interview with Mrs. Vence,"
he suggested.</p>

<p>The wine did Claudia good, and shortly she felt much more like
her ordinary self. Without wasting further time she related tersely
what had passed between herself and the housekeeper, Edwin listened
attentively without making any remark; but Lemby growled and cursed
under his breath the whole time. "Before I left," concluded
Claudia, "I suggested that dad and Edwin and I should meet Lady
Wyke, Mrs. Vence, and Neddy at Maranatha to come to an
understanding. Mrs. Vence goes down to Hedgerton at the end of the
week."</p>

<p>"I'll go, too," cried the pirate, rising to again stalk up and
down the room. "Do you think that I'm going to have these lies told
about me?"</p>

<p>"Are they lies?" asked Edwin, quietly.</p>

<p>Lemby hesitated, "The most part are lies," he said, sulkily.</p>

<p>"And what part is the truth?"</p>

<p>"That about my drawing my knife on Wyke," admitted Lemby, after
a pause. "I did get in a rage when Wyke told me that he was already
married, and I did take out my knife to frighten him. But I didn't
mean a dashed thing, you know, as it ain't my way to kill silly old
buffers. 'Sides, he'd pluck, he had, as he stood quite still when I
made a run at him, and only laughed."</p>

<p>"So Mrs. Vence said, dad."</p>

<p>"Well, she told the truth for once. I was in a rage, but I
couldn't hit a man who stood up to me unarmed. I'm a white man, I
am."</p>

<p>"You said at the inquest that Wyke did not explain anything to
you in the drawing-room," said Edwin, refusing to endorse Lemby's
good opinion of himself. "Yes, I did&mdash;and for why? Wyke waited
till I cooled down and took the knife from me, still laughing. Then
came the ring at the door. He was in a hurry to see you, Craver, I
expect, for he blamed well bolted down the stairs and forgot to lay
down my knife."</p>

<p>"He took it with him?" gasped Claudia, leaning forward.</p>

<p>"Don't I say he did?" growled her amiable parent. "Yes, he took
the knife with him, being in such a hurry. I didn't leave the
drawing-room for ever so long, and Mrs. Vence is a liar in saying
that I did. I waited until I heard voices, then came down and found
that the old man had passed in his cheques. When I saw it was my
knife sticking in his blessed old heart I made up my mind to say as
little as I could. And that," ended Lemby, turning towards Edwin,
"was the reason as I lied about his making explanations in the
drawing-room. What else could I do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Craver, promptly; "being innocent, there was no
need for you to incriminate yourself. This is the truth, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes it is. Why should I tell lies."</p>

<p>"Well, you did, you know, at the inquest. Anyhow, we have your
story and the housekeeper's story. Now we must learn what Neddy
Mellin has to say."</p>

<p>"I am sure that the boy knows the truth," said Claudia,
positively. "Mrs. Vence admitted that he was in the kitchen all the
time. She seemed sorry that she told me so."</p>

<p>"I daresay," remarked Edwin, "she has said too much. Well,
Lemby?"</p>

<p>"I'll come down to Hedgerton with you," said the pirate,
promptly.</p>

<p>And in this practical way the matter was settled.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_22" id=

</h2>

<p>All this time Lady Wyke gave no sign of her intentions. After
her interview with Craver, when she assured him that a will had
been made in his favour the wily woman remained silent. Perhaps she
was waiting for the young man to take the bribe and marry her,
trusting to his ignorance of the law concerning wills being
rendered null and void by marriage. Perhaps she was waiting for the
arrival of Mrs. Vence, in order to collect evidence and send
Claudia's father to the gallows. No one could tell what she meant
to do.</p>

<p>In spite of the dark clouds by which she was surrounded, Claudia
felt happier when she returned to Hedgerton Rectory. Her father was
with her, and Edwin also; so, protected in this way, she somehow
felt safe. Assured by Lemby that he was guiltless, and believing
implicitly that he had spoken the truth, Claudia felt convinced
that Lady Wyke would not be able to ruin him. Doubtless her father
had his faults; and his foolish rage, which had led him to draw his
knife on Wyke, had placed him in an awkward position. All the same,
it was not to be thought of for one moment that he would be allowed
to suffer for a crime, of which he was wholly innocent. And,
indeed, as the girl reflected, Lady Wyke could not herself be
positive of his guilt, or she would long ago have had him arrested.
Much of the truth had come to light concerning the Hedgerton
tragedy; but more had to come before the assassin of Wyke could be
placed in the dock. Since her father was innocent and Edwin was
innocent, Claudia could not think who was guilty. In the railway
carriage, when on the way to Redleigh, she asked Edwin's
opinion.</p>

<p>"H'm!" said the young man when thus appealed to. "It is
difficult to say, my dear girl. The truth may be found in Lady
Wyke's past life."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Edwin?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Lady Wyke knew that her husband had made a will
in her favour, for when she called on Sandal to say that she was
alive, and to stop the marriage with you, she made sure that there
was no new will. Now let us suppose that she learnt Wyke's
intention of leaving the money to me, so that I could marry you, is
it not likely that she would try and stop him making the new
will?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lemby, from his corner of the compartment, "it
blamed well is. Do you mean to say, Craver, that Lady Wyke murdered
the man herself?"</p>

<p>"No. Because, so far as we know, she did not come down to
Hedgerton until after the murder. If she had, her sister, Mrs.
Mellin, would have recognised her. But Lady Wyke might have hired
someone to stab Sir Hector."</p>

<p>"Pigs might fly," said the pirate, disbelievingly and vulgarly.
"Why. beyond yourself and myself, there was no one in the house at
the time."</p>

<p>"Neddy was in the house," suggested Claudia.</p>

<p>"Pouf!" said her father, contemptuously. "You don't mean to say
that such a small boy struck so vigorous a blow."</p>

<p>"No, I don't. But Neddy might know if a third person came to
Maranatha on that night."</p>

<p>"I wonder if Mrs. Vence killed the man herself?" murmured Edwin,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Of course not!" cried Claudia, quickly. "She had every reason
to keep Sir Hector alive, seeing that she had lost a good situation
by his death."</p>

<p>"Well, I give it up in despair. What do you think, Lemby?"</p>

<p>"I don't think at all," growled the big man, truculently. "It's
a dashed mystery, it is. If your theory is correct, and Lady Wyke
hired someone to stab the old man so that he mightn't make a new
will, the cove must have sneaked in by the back door."</p>

<p>"If he did Neddy will know, because he was in the kitchen long
before the crime was committed," said Miss Lemby. "Mrs. Vence
admitted as much."</p>

<p>"If Neddy saw any third person enter in that way, Mrs. Vence saw
him too," declared Edwin, positively, "for she was in the kitchen
also."</p>

<p>"Not all the time, Edwin. She was running about the house
listening, and looking through keyholes, as I told you."</p>

<p>"It is a mystery," sighed the young man, after a pause. "All we
can do is to wait for the arrival of Neddy and Mrs. Vence."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vence will be down on Saturday and Neddy on Sunday," said
Claudia. "You know he sings at the Tit-Bits Music Hall this
week."</p>

<p>"He hasn't made his appearance yet," growled Lemby. "Since you
spoke of the brat I have looked at the newspapers for his
appearance. Anyhow, whether he comes or not I'm going to see Lady
Wyke."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To ask her to marry me," said Lemby, coolly.</p>

<p>"She won't," said Craver with a stare of astonishment. "You are
the most hopeful man in the world if you think so, Lemby."</p>

<p>"It's cheek as does it, Craver. Anyhow, I'm going to have a shot
at it. She can but say no."</p>

<p>"It strikes me, Lemby," said the young man, drily, "that she'll
say much more." By the time the conversation reached this point,
the train was slowing down alongside the Redleigh platform. Edwin
got his motorcycle out of the luggage-room where he had stowed it,
and, placing Claudia in the sidecar, whirled off to Hedgerton.
Lemby engaged the same trap as he had formerly taken when paying
his visit to Wyke, and hoisted his portmanteau on to the seat
beside Sankey. He did not intend to go to the rectory, as he knew
that he would feel uncomfortable in the company of two such precise
people as the Rector and his wife. Therefore he ordered Sankey to
drive to the Jack Ashore Inn, where he had talked with Sergeant
Purse.</p>

<p>Claudia and Edwin were welcomed back joyfully to the Rectory,
for the old couple had missed them sorely. Mrs. Craver, being the
soul of hospitality, was vexed to hear that the girl's father had
gone to the inn instead of coming to the Rectory. She was anxious
to make his acquaintance and see at close quarters what he was
like. Of course, she had beheld him afar off when the inquest was
taking place; but she naturally desired to talk to him and examine
him and learn all about him. She little guessed that Claudia was
relieved at her father's decision to go to the Jack Ashore. The
girl had an uneasy feeling that prim Mrs. Craver would not approve
of the tyrant. It was with some uneasiness that she waited for the
call Lemby proposed to pay, for the purpose of making acquaintance
with the Rector and his wife. But he never came, either to dinner
nor after dinner. Although Claudia was relieved in one way, she was
annoyed in another, as she did not wish Mrs. Craver to think that
her father was entirely devoid of manners.</p>

<p>The fact is that Lemby quite intended to go to the Rectory for
his meal and to meet his prospective relatives. But after he had
settled himself at the inn, he began to think that it would be just
as well to get the interview over. There was no doubt about it that
Lady Wyke was in a position to make things hot for him if she used
the evidence of Mrs. Vence, so that the buccaneer thought that he
would close her mouth by requesting her hand in marriage. It was
ridiculous to think for one moment that she would prefer a battered
old pirate such as he was to a smart and handsome young fellow like
Craver. But Lemby had always made his way by sheer audacity, and he
hoped to storm Lady Wyke into submission. In this truculent frame
of mind he set out for Maranatha shortly after six o'clock.</p>

<p>When he sent in his card Lady Wyke received him at once, and he
looked upon this reception as a good omen. He little knew that the
little woman wished to learn the plans of her enemies, and had
received him so blandly with the object of pumping him. For the
purpose of conquest, and to show that he knew what civilisation
was, Lemby had arrayed himself in evening dress. He looked a fine,
handsome man, when he entered the big drawing-room, and the mellow
light of the lamps took years off his life, as they did off the
life of Lady Wyke. She came forward with a smile to greet him,
looking remarkably attractive and well preserved in a gorgeous
dinner-gown of crimson and black.</p>

<p>"I am so glad to see you, Mr. Lemby," she said, graciously. "We
have not met for ever so long, although we have had much
correspondence."</p>

<p>"I reckon," said the pirate, coolly, "that the correspondence
wasn't over-satisfactory to me."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you must make allowances for a woman's whims," said
Lady Wyke, with equal coolness. "I read between the lines, you
know."</p>

<p>"Then you must guess why I have called."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do, and perhaps I don't. Anyhow, Mr. Lemby, as you
are here, you may as well have dinner with me."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd ask me," said the buccaneer, with has ineffable
audacity, "so I got tidied up on purpose."</p>

<p>"So clever of you," said his hostess, with a queer smile, and
rang the bell to order that another knife and fork should be placed
on the table.</p>

<p>The two chatted about this matter and that. They discussed the
news in the daily papers, they talked about various other
experiences in America and in the South Seas, and touched upon
every subject save on that which was nearest to their hearts. Both
wished to break the ice and converse about the murder, but neither
would speak first on so serious a subject. By the time the
dinner-gong thundered both were quite friendly yet got quite
watchful. It, seemed as though the good-fellowship of the meal was
necessary to break down the reserve between them. But the moment
had not yet come.</p>

<p>"Give me your arm, Mr. Lemby," said Lady Wyke, languidly
graceful, and showing nothing of the vicious cat who had fought
with the man's daughter. "I'm sure you must be hungry."</p>

<p>"I live on love," said the pirate, gruffly, and, as he thought,
gallantly.</p>

<p>"You must be hungry, then, as there is nothing for you to eat of
that nature."</p>

<p>Lemby turned aside the arrow with a laugh, and shortly found
himself seated at a beautifully-decorated table, to eat a
delicately-cooked dinner. He did full justice to the admirable
dishes and to the very excellent wine, while Lady Wyke ate little
and amused him with desultory conversation. All the time she was
watching him, wondering why he had called and what he was trying to
do. So far she could not fathom his motives; but when champagne had
loosened his tongue and tobacco had soothed his nerves&mdash;if he
had any&mdash;she hoped to learn all she desired to learn. But
during dinner she purposely kept off the subject of the murder, and
it was only when they returned to the scented drawing-room that she
spoke. Then the pirate, in a comfortable armchair, sipped his
coffee and smoked an excellent cigar, while his hostess trifled
with a cigarette and began to talk sense for the first time during
the evening.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Lemby," she said, resolutely, "let us get to
business."</p>

<p>"What business?" asked the buccaneer, wilfully dense.</p>

<p>"That about which we correspond," said Lady Wyke, promptly. "You
said that you would assist me to learn who murdered my husband so I
presume you have come to tell me something about your
discoveries."</p>

<p>"I haven't made any you don't know anything about," said Lemby,
incoherently.</p>

<p>"What do I know?"</p>

<p>"You dashed well know that Craver was the man who sloped on the
postman's bike on that night. You tried to rope him into the
business, but failed."</p>

<p>"For the time being I have failed, Mr. Lemby; but I may rope him
in, as you put it, later. Well, and what else do I know?"</p>

<p>"You know that Mrs. Vence is a liar."</p>

<p>"Oh, do I?" Lady Wyke raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Yes. Claudia saw Mrs. Vence the other day&mdash;yesterday, in
fact, and she said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vence or Claudia? Do be accurate."</p>

<p>"The old woman," growled Lemby, who did not like to be
interrupted. "She said as how I came down the stairs with my knife
and murdered Wyke."</p>

<p>"Well, the knife with which the crime was committed is yours,
you know."</p>

<p>"Who says so? How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vence says so. She told me."</p>

<p>"Then she's a liar."</p>

<p>Lady Wyke shrugged her shoulders. "You'll have to make a
stronger defence than that Mr. Lemby. We may as well be plain with
one another. I have asked Mrs. Vence to come down here, and she
will be in this house on Friday evening. I shan't be here to
receive her, unfortunately, as I have to go to London to get that
will of mine destroyed."</p>

<p>"What will?"</p>

<p>"One I made in favour of Mr. Craver."</p>

<p>"He told me," nodded Lemby. "Silly business, seeing that a
marriage makes it so much waste paper."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Craver has found that out, has he?" said Lady Wyke
calmly. "I thought he wasn't clever enough. Yes, it was a false
move on my part, and I'm going to tear up the will. It's of no use
now. I only made it to try and get Mr. Craver to marry me. Well,
then, I'm going up on Friday for that purpose, and will return on
Saturday evening. But you must not see Mrs. Vence in the meantime,
and I shall leave word that she is not to see you. When I return,
then, in my presence, you can meet her and defend yourself."</p>

<p>"It's all dashed rot!" cried Lemby, with disgust. "I never
killed the man, nor did Craver."</p>

<p>"Then who did?"</p>

<p>"Might have been Mrs. Vence."</p>

<p>"Rubbish! It was her interest to keep him alive. She lost a good
situation by my husband's death remember."</p>

<p>"It might have been Neddy. He was in the house all the
time."</p>

<p>"So Mrs. Vence says. But a boy like that&mdash;pooh!"</p>

<p>"Might have been yourself."</p>

<p>Lady Wyke laughed. "I was in London at the time, and can prove
that I was. I don't think, however, that I'll be called upon to
defend myself."</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Lemby, significantly. "I might suggest that to
Purse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you will unless I agree to marry you," finished the woman,
coolly.</p>

<p>"That's right smart of you," Lemby assured her. "I came here to
ask you to marry me. Craver won't have you; he's set on
Claudia."</p>

<p>"I haven't lost all hope yet of getting him," said Lady Wyke
through her clenched teeth, and looked at the man in a lowering
way.</p>

<p>"Shucks! There's no chance there. Marry me."</p>

<p>"No. But I'll make a bargain with you."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"If Edwin will not marry me he must be hanged. Help me to hang
him, and I'll become your wife."</p>

<p>Lemby was quite unmoved by this villainous proposal. "No, ma'am,
that wouldn't be dealing square. I must think of my gal, you know.
Try another man for the job. I'm no saint, but I draw the line at
your suggestion."</p>

<p>"I shall try no other man," cried Lady Wyke, standing up and
smiling strangely; "and, indeed, I need no assistance. I can prove
Mr. Craver's guilt. Mrs. Vence is coming down, Neddy is coming
down, and I have him in a trap. If Mr. Craver is not in gaol by
Monday afternoon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, ma'am?" Questioned the pirate, roughly, and bending
forward.</p>

<p>"I'll marry you when and where you like."</p>

<p>"It's a bargain," said Lemby, gruffly; "and I'll twist your neck
if you break it."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_23" id=
"Chapter_23"></a>Chapter 23</b>
</h2>

<p>Mr. Oliver Lemby did not trouble to see Lady Wyke again. The two
quite understood one another, and there was no need for further
conversation. Seeing what Claudia had learnt from Mrs. Vence, the
pirate was indeed surprised that Sir Hector's widow intended to
leave him alone and get Edwin arrested. Being so passionate and
vindictive a woman, it was natural enough that she desired rather
to see Craver in the dock than at the altar beside Claudia. Since
she could not get him herself&mdash;and she had tried every means
in her power to win him&mdash;it was plain that she intended to see
him hanged rather than permit him to marry her rival. Her motive
was easily guessed, but what puzzled Lemby was how she meant to
bring about her aim. The evidence of Mrs. Vence, as the pirate
knew, was against him, and involved him deeply in the crime.
Therefore it did not seem much good for the widow to bring the
housekeeper down to Hedgerton in order to implicate Edwin, which,
on the face of it, she could not do. The sole way in which Lemby
could conjecture Lady Wyke intended to act was that Neddy would be
used to accuse Craver. But then Neddy liked Craver, and was
friendly to Claudia, so he might not be inclined to the woman's
bidding. And, so far as could be seen. Lady Wyke had no means of
compelling the boy, or Mrs. Vence either, to give false evidence.
It was all a mystery.</p>

<p>It said a good deal for Lemby's nerves that he was able to enjoy
himself in Hedgerton with the sword of Damocles hanging over his
head. But enjoy himself he did, and made himself very agreeable to
the old people. Claudia's fears proved to be groundless, for her
father behaved with unusual meekness, and showed the best side of
his character. Lemby was not altogether bad, and had many good
points. Refined he assuredly was not, but he had the breezy, gay
air of a soldier of fortune, which fascinated the Rector and his
wife. They had never before met with such a one, and the novelty of
his conversation charmed them. The pirate talked of adventures in
the South Seas, of wanderings in Patagonia, Peru, and Brazil, and
of strange doings in Australia. A tendency to exaggeration and
boastfulness which characterised his speech made Mr. Craver dub him
Parolles, after the personage in Shakespeare's comedy. But Lemby,
ignorant of literature, took this as a compliment, which amused the
Rector greatly. On the whole, Claudia found that her father was a
greater success than might have been hoped for, and therefore
breathed more freely. He certainly behaved very well for a man of
his loose habits and loose upbringing.</p>

<p>The pirate did not tell his daughter how Lady Wyke had arranged
to marry him if Edwin was arrested. In the first place, he did not
see how she was going to bring about such a catastrophe, and in the
second he saw no reason to worry Claudia. If nothing happened
before Sunday, then Craver determined to force his way into
Maranatha, along with Claudia and Lemby, in order to face Mrs.
Vence in Lady Wyke's presence. Matters, as he said, must come to a
climax somehow and at some time. Things could not go on as they
were doing.</p>

<p>"Didn't Lady Wyke, say what she intended to do?" Edwin asked
Lemby for the fourth or fifth time on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>"No," said the buccaneer, with an unmoved face, and lying
glibly. "I called to see her. I had dinner with her, and after
dinner I asked her to marry me. She said that she would think about
it."</p>

<p>"Rather strange, Lemby, considering Lady Wyke must know how Mrs.
Vence accuses you of committing the crime."</p>

<p>"I told her that the woman was a liar, and she believed me,"
said Lemby.</p>

<p>"Hum!" replied Craver, doubtfully. "I don't think that Lady Wyke
is a woman to be so easily convinced. She'll have you arrested, my
friend."</p>

<p>"She may do the same to you, Craver."</p>

<p>"Well, she might. Going by circumstantial evidence, things look
very black against us both. Your use of the knife and my use of the
postman's bicycle both go to show that each had a finger in the
pie. If Sergeant Purse knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care whether he knows or not," broke in Lemby. "I'm
willing to stand my trial if you are."</p>

<p>"Well," said Craver, with a shrug, "we may both be placed in the
dock. It all depends upon Lady Wyke and Mrs. Vence. I suppose you
know that she arrived at Maranatha last night. Mrs. Mellin told
Mrs. Craver, and added that Lady Wyke had gone to town. It is
strange that Lady Wyke didn't wait to see her visitor."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can explain that," said Lemby, stolidly. "Lady Wyke told
me she was going to London to destroy that silly will she made in
your favour. She admitted that it didn't work since you refused to
marry her."</p>

<p>"I should think I did refuse," said Edwin, heatedly. "I marry
Claudia, or no one, Lemby. However, Lady Wyke went to London at
mid-day on Friday, and Mrs. Vence arrived at Maranatha late last
night. I wish you could see her."</p>

<p>"I can't. Lady Wyke said that she would give orders that Mrs.
Vence was not to see me except in her presence."</p>

<p>"She'll see the lot of us in her presence," said Edwin, grimly.
"To-morrow or on Monday we go to Maranatha and thresh the whole
matter out."</p>

<p>"I'm agreeable," said Lemby. "What are you going to do
to-day?"</p>

<p>"I have to see about some repairs to my aeroplane, and late in
the afternoon I intend to take a flight. Will you come with
me?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>Craver then left the buccaneer with the Rector, and walked along
the cliffs to the barn where his aeroplane was sheltered. The
building was a tithe barn standing on glebe land belonging to the
Rector of Hedgerton, but, being little used, had fallen into decay.
As it was a very large erection with brick walls and thatched roof,
Edwin had cleverly turned it into a shelter for his aeroplane by
breaking down the front and adding huge double doors. There was
ample room for the machine, notwithstanding the wide spread of its
wings, and it slipped in and out very easily. In the barn there was
a loft which nobody used, and the rude ladder from the ground to
the opening overhead had long since been taken away. Mr. Craver did
not trouble about the loft, but left it to the rats and owls, to
the nesting of starlings and swallows. He was content to have the
roof rainproof and the doors stout, so that the machine could be
kept dry and wholly safe from robbers. On the whole, it was a most
convenient place for the aeroplane, as the machine had plenty of
room outside when it emerged to run for the time before ascending.
Nothing could have suited Craver's purpose better.</p>

<p>To Edwin's surprise he found Neddy Mellin hovering round the
barn when he arrived, trying the doors and peeping in at various
points. The lad looked rather pale, but was as smart as ever in his
Eton suit. Craver wondered why he had come to Hedgerton,
considering that he was engaged to sing at the Tit-Bits Music Hall,
and might necessarily be supposed to have remained in town for the
Saturday matinee.</p>

<p>"What the dickens are you doing here, Neddy?" he asked,
sharply.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to get a squint at your aeroplane, sir," said Neddy,
smartly touching his hat. "There isn't any harm in that, is there,
sir?"</p>

<p>"No. I don't mean that. Neddy. But why aren't you singing?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I've got a touch of hoarseness, and the cove as
teaches me said I'd better wait until next week. I was going to
sing 'Sally in Our Alley' this week, but I didn't. I'm choky,
sir."</p>

<p>The boy certainly spoke in rather a hoarse manner, and Edwin
advised him to go home and surrender himself to his mother's care.
"The wind is rather keen, Neddy, and you might catch a fresh
cold."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm all right, sir," said the lad, indifferently. "Mother
only bothers me with her medicine and coddling. Do let me have a
look at the machine, sir, and do take me up with you this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"I can't do that unless your mother consents, Neddy." said
Craver, kindly. "But by all means you can look at the
aeroplane."</p>

<p>He unlocked the doors and conducted the delighted boy into the
vast interior of the barn. The next two hours were spent joyfully
by Neddy in assisting Craver to do the necessary repairs, and he
proved to be very useful in getting what was wanted. With the eager
curiosity of his age the lad examined every portion of the machine
and asked innumerable questions. All these Edwin answered
good-naturedly. Once or twice it was on the tip of his tongue to
question Neddy about the events of the night when Wyke met with his
death, but on swift reflection he decided to wait for a more
fitting occasion. As the boy was devoted to Claudia and very
grateful to himself for being allowed to help with the repairs,
Edwin believed that he would not side with Lady Wyke, however much
she wished it. Therefore he was quite content to wait. Later on,
when Claudia was with him, they could examine the boy together and
learn what he really knew likely to reveal the truth.</p>

<p>About twelve o'clock Edwin found that he had left a particular
screw at home, and went back for it. Neddy offered to go readily;
but Craver alone knew where the screw was to be found, and went
himself. He left Neddy in charge of the barn and the aeroplane,
warning him not to allow anyone to enter. With great pride the lad
took up his post as sentry, and Edwin ran back across the wide
spaces of land to the rectory, intending to return immediately. But
he was prevented from doing so.</p>

<p>"I saw Mrs. Vence on the esplanade," said Claudia, meeting her
lover at the gate. "I saw her when I went out for an errand for
your mother."</p>

<p>"Did you speak to her?"</p>

<p>"No. I was some distance away, and when she saw me she ran
off."</p>

<p>"Ran off! That old woman?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Edwin, she is very quick on her legs, and got out of the
way in a most surprising manner. Afterwards I met Mrs. Mellin down
in the village, and she told me that Mrs. Vence was looking for
Neddy."</p>

<p>"What does she want with him?" asked Craver, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Perhaps she wants to tell him to hold his tongue,
and is afraid lest we should question him."</p>

<p>"I haven't questioned him yet, Claudia; but now that I know Mrs.
Vence is on the warpath I shall ask him immediately I return to the
barn. It is just as well for us to learn what he knows before Mrs.
Vence gets hold of him. All the same, I don't see why she should
tell him to hold his tongue."</p>

<p>"We don't know if she intends to do so, Edwin. It is only a
guess on my part, dear. Is Neddy still with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He has been with me for the last two hours helping with
the repairs. I suppose his mother knows where he is."</p>

<p>"Yes. She said that Mrs. Vence sent a message from Maranatha
asking that Neddy should come to see her, and Mrs. Mellin replied
that he was at the barn on the cliffs with you. He told his mother
that he was going to try and see the aeroplane. Then, I suppose,
Mrs. Vence came out to look for him."</p>

<p>"She hasn't been near the barn, at any rate. Claudia, I am very
suspicious of that old woman. It seems to me that she wants to make
Neddy hold his tongue."</p>

<p>"Why should she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," Craver pondered, deeply. "After all, she may
have slipped the knife into Wyke herself. Remember, he brought it
down the stairs and may have laid it on the study table when
speaking to me. Now that I come to think of it." added Edwin with a
start, "he did. I remember distinctly."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so before?"</p>

<p>"I forgot. All this business is refreshing my memory. Remember,
Claudia, I was very upset at the moment, and my mind was somewhat
clouded. It's only coming back to me bit by bit. Yes, Wyke did have
the knife, and did throw it on the table before he took me into the
dining-room. He returned there, and perhaps Mrs. Vence met him with
the knife in her hand to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Edwin! Edwin! We can't be sure. She had no reason to murder Sir
Hector."</p>

<p>"Has she any reason to force Neddy to hold his tongue?"</p>

<p>"We don't know if she has any such intention, Edwin."</p>

<p>"Let us find out, Claudia. Wait for a minute. I want to find a
screw, and then we can both go back to question the boy. We must
examine him before Mrs. Vence puts her oar in."</p>

<p>Claudia consented, and Edwin ran into the rectory. He was a long
time away, as he could not find the screw. When he did return, he
set out at once for the barn with Claudia. By this time he had been
absent fully three-quarters of an hour. Never thinking of the shock
that was waiting for them, the young couple walked leisurely
towards the barn and along the cliffs, chatting easily. Shortly
they arrived at the building, but could see no sign of Neddy
outside, although Edwin expected to find him doing sentry-go. With
an exclamation of vexation at Neddy's negligence, he stepped
within, and then cried out; "Claudia! Come quick."</p>

<p>The girl, who was listening behind, ran in to see Craver
stooping over the insensible form of the lad. Neddy was lying face
downwards and bleeding from an ugly wound in the head, evidently
inflicted by some blunt instrument. To all appearances he was
dead.</p>

<p>"Oh, Edwin! who has done this?" cried Claudia, piteously, as she
knelt beside the poor boy's body.</p>

<p>"I suspect Mrs. Vence, although I have no reason to believe so.
We must carry him to the rectory, Claudia, as we can do nothing
with him here."</p>

<p>"Is he dead?"</p>

<p>"I think not. Only stunned. Wait a minute. Claudia, I'll ask one
of the coastguards to watch the barn and get another to help."</p>

<p>Edwin ran off, while Claudia tried to staunch the wound with her
handkerchief. Shortly the young man came back with the two men, and
while one remained to guard the machine, the other assisted Edwin
to carry the insensible hoy to the rectory. Mrs. Craver received
them at the door, and was loud in her expressions of regret. A
messenger was sent off for the doctor and for Mrs. Mellin, while
Neddy was attended to by the rector's wife and by Claudia.</p>

<p>The two did all they could to revive him. But the blow had been
so heavy that the boy was quite stunned. Nevertheless, after much
trouble with brandy, and bathing and smelling-salts, the boy
vaguely opened his blue eyes. At once his gaze fell on Claudia
bending over him. His lips moved.</p>

<p>"She did it."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vence."</p>

<p>"Why, Neddy?"</p>

<p>The boy's gaze wandered, and he showed signs of relapsing into
insensibility again. But Claudia, knowing what was at stake, asked
the question again.</p>

<p>"Mrs.&mdash;Vence&mdash;murdered&mdash;the&mdash;old 'un!" Then
Neddy's eyes closed and again he became insensible.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_24" id=
"Chapter_24"></a>Chapter 24</b>
</h2>

<p>After that momentary gleam of consciousness, Neddy relapsed into
insensibility, and became dead to the world for a long time. Mrs.
Mellin arrived in tears, and insisted that the boy should be
removed to her own poor home, so that he might be nursed and looked
after. But the doctor, who was by this time on the spot, urged that
the poor lad should be taken at once to the Redleigh Hospital, as
it was probable that an operation would be necessary. The rector
agreed with this suggestion, and after a lengthy argument Mrs.
Mellin was induced to consent to the arrangement. A motor-car
carried both Neddy and his mother to Redleigh, and everything
possible having thus been done for the victim, it now remained to
find the assailant. It was fortunate that the boy had been able to
give the name of the person who struck him down, as it made things
easier for the police. While Neddy was being attended to, Edwin
wired to Redleigh for Sergeant Purse, and he was expected to arrive
every moment. But before the officer came the injured boy was
removed to the hospital.</p>

<p>While the rector and his wife were talking over the untoward
event, Claudia managed to draw her lover into another room for a
private conversation. This privacy was necessary, as, knowing what
they did, the young couple could not converse freely in the
presence of Mr. and Mrs. Craver. Edwin still wished to keep them in
ignorance of what was going on, as things were not yet shipshape.
When Claudia had Edwin to herself, and bluntly asked what he was
going to do, he quite as bluntly answered her.</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell the whole story to Sergeant Purse," he said,
firmly.</p>

<p>"But you and dad may be arrested if you tell the truth,"
protested the girl uneasily.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. Remember, in your presence and in the
presence of my mother, Neddy has accused Mrs. Vence of the crime.
Until she is caught, and the truth of the statement is proved,
Purse may have us watched, but he certainly will not arrest
us."</p>

<p>"Do you think that Mrs. Vence is guilty, Edwin?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it. Otherwise, why should the boy say so."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vence was certainly uneasy when she let slip the fact that
Neddy was in the house all the time," said Miss Lemby,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I quite understand that," replied the young man, promptly. "In
the heat of the conversation she said too much. Like many another
clever criminal, she gave herself away."</p>

<p>"But why should she murder Sir Hector?"</p>

<p>"That is what we have to find out, and will learn when she is
arrested."</p>

<p>"Hiding somewhere, Claudia. From what Mrs. Mellin said, she knew
where the boy was to be found, and probably followed him. I daresay
she was lurking round the barn while Neddy was assisting me with
the repairs, but, owing to my presence, did not get a chance of
harming him. Then, when I came back for the screw, she took the
opportunity and, as she thought, killed the one witness who could
prove her guilt."</p>

<p>Claudia nodded. "It seems to be plain enough. But are you wise
in telling the sergeant what you and dad have had to do with the
crime? Would it not be better to wait until Mrs. Vence is arrested
and confesses her guilt?"</p>

<p>"No, Claudia," said Edwin, positively. "I must speak out now.
There has been quite enough of this hole-and-corner work. Your
father and I are both quite innocent, and for our own safety we
must put ourselves under the protection of the law; otherwise the
deuce, knows what will happen."</p>

<p>Claudia, after some consideration, agreed with this view, but
begged Edwin not to confess until her father was consulted. The
young man had no objection to taking this course, and in order to
lose no time he set out for the inn with the intention of bringing
Lemby back to the rectory. Then the three could wait for the
arrival of Purse and the statement could be made. So matters were
arranged; but, as Fate would have it, Claudia and her lover met the
sergeant driving along the esplanade while on their way to the
village. He stopped the trap when he saw them and made
inquiries.</p>

<p>"What's this about your having found out who murdered Sir Hector
Wyke?" asked the lean little man, abruptly. "I just received your
message, Mr. Craver, and came on at once. Three or four policemen
are following."</p>

<p>"You will need them all, and need Jervis, too, in order to catch
Mrs. Vence," said Craver, promptly. "She is the culprit."</p>

<p>"Who says so?"</p>

<p>"Neddy Mellin." And Edwin gave a hasty sketch of what had
happened, so as to put Purse in full possession of the facts.</p>

<p>When he had concluded, the sergeant whistled. "Fancy that, now.
I never should have suspected that old woman. She gave her evidence
very clearly at the inquest, and put me off the scent by her very
clearness. I should like to see the boy and question him."</p>

<p>"You can't," said Claudia, quickly. "He only became conscious
enough to tell, in my presence, and in the presence of Mrs. Craver,
who had struck him down. Now he is insensible again, and has been
taken to the Redleigh Hospital."</p>

<p>"Oh, has he? I wish I had seen him before he went. However, I
can call at the hospital when I return."</p>

<p>"That won't do much good, sergeant," said Craver, with a shrug.
"The boy is not able to recognise anyone or to talk at all. Better
come with me and with Miss Lemby, here, to see her father, who is
at the Jack Ashore."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Purse, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"We have something to tell you."</p>

<p>"In connection with the death of Sir Hector Wyke?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It won't take long to put you in possession of what we
know, and then you can search for Mrs. Vence." Purse drew out his
watch. "I'll give you half an hour," he said, pompously. "We can
then go back to the Rectory. I have told my men to meet me there.
In fact, Mr. Craver, I expected to find you there also."</p>

<p>"You would have," said Edwin drily, "but that the necessity
arose of my going to see Mr. Lemby about what we have to tell
you."</p>

<p>"And Miss Lemby?"</p>

<p>"She wishes to be present, although she has nothing to do with
the mater."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I have," chimed in Claudia. "I can tell the sergeant
what Mrs. Vence said to me the other day."</p>

<p>Purse grunted and looked suspiciously at the girl, then, with a
nod, agreed to do as he was asked. The Redleigh trap was dismissed,
and the trio walked on to the inn. There, in the very room wherein
the officer had seen Lemby prior to the inquest, he saw him again.
The pirate was startled and disturbed by this invasion of his
privacy, and when Edwin privately told him of the determination he
had arrived at, he hoarsely objected. But matters had gone too far
for these objections to have any weight, so in the end Mr. Lemby
was quite agreeable to say what he knew. Then the quartette took
their seats, and Purse produced his pocket-book.</p>

<p>"Anything you say will be used in evidence against you," he
recited, in quite a mechanical way. "Now, Mr. Craver."</p>

<p>Edwin related in what way he was connected in the matter, and
Purse started when he heard that the man before him was the hero of
the red bicycle escapade. But he did not interrupt, and speedily
noted down all details. Lemby followed immediately on Edwin's
heels, and recounted the episode of the knife, which he bluntly
acknowledged to be his. Then Claudia took up the tale, and put the
sergeant in possession of all facts connected with the hunt for the
assassin, including her visit to Mrs. Vence and the statement of
Neddy that the old woman was the culprit. All these things the
officer took down, and scribbled furiously. When he had finished,
and his book was replaced in his pocket, he looked steadily at the
three people before him.</p>

<p>"You have all acted wrongly," said the sergeant, in a harsh,
official voice. "I should have known of these things long ago."</p>

<p>"We were not bound to incriminate ourselves," said Edwin,
smartly.</p>

<p>"I could have helped you."</p>

<p>"Not you, confound it!" growled Lemby, aggressively. "If we had
owned up before the truth became known you would have run us in.
Come now, confess."</p>

<p>"Well, it is probable that I should," admitted the sergeant,
reluctantly. "After all, things look black against you and against
Mr. Craver here."</p>

<p>"Of course. And that is the dashed reason why we held our
tongues."</p>

<p>Purse, after reflection, made no answer to this, and rose to
intimate that the conference was at an end.</p>

<p>"The next thing to be done is to find this old woman," said the
sergeant.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said Lemby, rising. "How do we stand?"</p>

<p>"Where you were," said Purse, gruffly. "I don't intend to have
you arrested, if you mean that. But until this business is cleared
up by the arrest of Mrs. Vence, I'll keep an eye on you."</p>

<p>"That is only reasonable," said Edwin, readily. "However, I beg
one boon of you, sergeant. Don't let my father or my mother know
anything about what we have told you."</p>

<p>"If Mrs. Vence is arrested, the whole story must come out,
sir."</p>

<p>"Then wait until you do arrest the woman. But until Mr. Lemby
and I are free from danger, I don't wish my parents to know."</p>

<p>"Fair enough," growled the sergeant "I'll hold my tongue. Now
come along. She can't have gone far, and we'll soon lay hands on
her. The old wretch, to cheat me so! Hang her! She has pulled the
wool over my eyes."</p>

<p>There was no doubt of this. Mrs. Vence had proved too clever for
Purse at the inquest, and it seemed as though she would again
escape him. All that afternoon search was made throughout
Hedgerton, but without success. The servants at Maranatha stated
that Mrs. Vence had left the house hours ago and had not returned.
An inquiry at Mrs. Mellin's cottage showed that the old woman had
not been there. Various people, questioned by the police, stated
that they had seen the housekeeper wandering about the esplanade,
and a coastguard remembered to have noticed her on the cliffs.
These were searched, the beach was examined, the woods round
Hedgerton were explored, and the village itself was beaten for the
fugitive, but all unsuccessfully. It seemed as though Mrs. Vence
had taken wings to herself and had flown away. Yet it seemed
ridiculous to think that so old and so infirm a woman could escape
so easily. By the time it was four o'clock the sergeant was furious
at being made to look such a fool. But swearing did not help him.
Mrs. Vence had vanished, and was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>"Well," said Purse, when he came across Edwin and Claudia at the
barn, whither they had gone to look at the aeroplane, "what's to be
done now?"</p>

<p>"You can't find her?" said Miss Lemby, anxiously.</p>

<p>"No. You know the old wretch by sight. See here, take this
police whistle, and if you spot her, blow for all you are
worth."</p>

<p>"But I am not likely to see her," protested Claudia. "If a
clever man like you can't find her, how do you expect me to?"</p>

<p>"See here, young lady," broke in the irate officer. "Mrs. Vence
is hiding. While the police are about she'll not show. I intend to
collect my men at the rectory and then come along to have a talk
with the coastguard yonder. There is a man there I want to examine.
Now, when Mrs. Vence sees that the coast is clear she may venture
out, as she won't take any notice of you. Keep your eyes open and
blow the whistle if you see her. That's all I ask."</p>

<p>"You ask a great deal, sergeant," said Claudia, drily. "And my
father?"</p>

<p>"He will remain at the rectory with my men. Will you do what I
ask?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I warn you that I don't anticipate success," said
Claudia, slipping the whistle into her pocket.</p>

<p>"Neither do I. But I'm grasping at straws," growled the
sergeant, who was very hot and very angry.</p>

<p>He was turning away from the barn to go to the rectory and
collect his men, when Edwin stopped him for a moment. "Have you any
objection to my taking a flight, sergeant?" he asked. "I want to
try my machine now it is repaired?"</p>

<p>Edwin quite expected the man to object, but, to his surprise,
the sergeant at once assented. "Seeing you going away on the
aeroplane will make Mrs. Vence think that we have given up the
hunt, and she will venture out to escape. Go, by all means, Mr.
Craver. I'll come back to see you start."</p>

<p>Purse hurried away, and Edwin made ready his machine. He only
intended to take a short flight over the water and then return, as
he merely wished to see if the repairs were all right. To provide
against accidents he placed a coil of rope on the pilot's seat. It
might be wanted, and it might not. All the same, it was just as
well that it should be there. Shortly, and just when Purse returned
from the rectory, Edwin was ready, and called two or three
coastguards from their station to assist in the ascent. While they
ran the aeroplane along the ground to give it the impetus to rise,
Purse cast his eyes here, there, and everywhere, in the hope of
seeing Mrs. Vence. Why he expected her to remain in the vicinity of
her crime it is impossible to say. But he could not help thinking
that she was lurking about close at hand. However, his attention
was called from watching by the ascent of the great machine, which
rose majestically into the air, swept round in a great circle, and
then turned its nose seaward. Looking up and following its flight,
Purse walked along towards the coastguard station, leaving Claudia
seated in the shadow near the front of the barn. She was behind one
of the double doors, and could not be seen from within.</p>

<p>For a time Claudia watched the aeroplane swooping and soaring
and dipping and rising in the rainbow-coloured sunset sky. When it
dwindled to a mere black dot she let her eyes sink to the ground,
and blinked to get the dazzle out of them. Suddenly she heard a
stealthy noise, and looked through the aperture between the door
and the barn, where it swung on its hinges. To her surprise, she
saw someone climbing actively down the wall, having emerged from
the trapdoor leading to the loft. There was no ladder, as has been
explained, so the person in question had to descend like a monkey,
using feet and hands to cling to the rough wail, A glint of
sunshine showed Claudia a blue dress and a red knitted shawl, so
she was not long in doubt as to whom the individual was. Evidently
Mrs. Vence, after striking down the boy, had climbed up into the
loft in order to hide, and now that she believed the coast to be
clear was trying to escape into the open. No one had ever thought
of searching the loft, so the astute old woman had shown uncommon
sense in choosing her hiding-place.</p>

<p>With bated breath Claudia rose silently and waited patiently,
drawing the whistle from her pocket, Mrs. Vence, quite ignorant
that she was being watched, crept down like a huge bat, and then
made a run for the door. Just as she emerged, Claudia sprang at her
and the old woman uttered a shriek like the cry of a trapped
animal. Afterwards she became silent and fought viciously. But
Claudia, knowing what was at stake, held on tightly. In the
struggle the woman's spectacles fell off, then her bonnet and a
mass of false hair. She was unmasked.</p>

<p>"Lady Wyke!" gasped Claudia, "Lady Wyke!"</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_25" id=
"Chapter_25"></a>Chapter 25</b>
</h2>

<p>"Lady Wyke! Lady Wyke!" babbled Claudia, dazed by the amazing
discovery.</p>

<p>"You beast!" snarled the detected murderess, and wrenched
herself free, to run swiftly across the open space between the barn
and the zig-zag path which led down to the beach.</p>

<p>Claudia, seeing her quarry escaping, recovered her senses
promptly, and blew a shrill call on the police whistle. In a moment
Sergeant Purse, at the not too distant coastguard station, heard
the signal, and came running out. He saw in a moment the flying
figure of the woman, and sped towards her like a deer, in order to
intercept her before she reached the cliffs. At the same time
Claudia sprang forward also, and reached the fugitive almost at the
same time as the officer. Purse laid hands on his prey just as she
reached the opening of the path, and dexterously flung her on the
ground. Lady Wyke, seeing that she was lost, howled like a wild
beast, and swore like several troopers in her anger and baffled
rage. But the sergeant paid no attention to her curses. When he
rose she was lying on the ground with handcuffs on her wrists.
Claudia silently stood looking down on her captured enemy, not
knowing whether to laugh or cry, so unstrung did she feel. Unable
to say a word, she turned red and white alternately, and awaited
events.</p>

<p>"Get up, Mrs. Vence," said Purse, briefly.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;not&mdash;Mrs. Vence," quavered Claudia, in a shaky
voice. "It's Lady Wyke."</p>

<p>"Gosh!" gasped the sergeant, astonished for once in his official
life. "Do you mean to say that she murdered her husband?"</p>

<p>There was no answer from either woman. Lady Wyke rolled on the
dry grass cursing freely, while Claudia sat down on a convenient
rock to clasp her hands tightly and keep herself from
trembling&mdash;in fact, from breaking down altogether. No one else
was at hand, as the policemen at the rectory had not heard the
whistle, and Purse had waved back the coastguards who seemed
disposed to approach. He did not wish anyone should share the glory
of his capture, and desired then and there to hear Lady Wyke's
story, so that he could be sure he had arrested the right
person.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said Purse, shaking his finger at her sternly,
"what have you to say, madam? Remember, anything you do say will be
used in evidence against you."</p>

<p>"Oh," sneered Lady Wyke, looking very white and very vicious,
"and you think that I'll be fool enough to speak after that
warning. How dare you arrest an innocent person such as I am!"</p>

<p>"You are guilty," said Claudia, hoarsely. "You murdered Sir
Hector."</p>

<p>"It's a lie."</p>

<p>"Neddy Mellin can prove it."</p>

<p>"Then until he does, I am guiltless," raged the woman,
furiously. "Take these handcuffs off, man."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the sergeant, smoothly. "I have arrested you as
Mrs. Vence, who struck down that boy. Afterwards you can be
arrested for the murder of your husband as Lady Wyke."</p>

<p>"I didn't kill him, I tell you," she snarled viciously. "As to
the boy, I never saw him."</p>

<p>"Rats!" growled Purse inelegantly. "If you are innocent of
assault, why did you hide in that loft?"</p>

<p>Lady Wyke scowled, and saw that there was no escape from the
lesser crime. "I only hit the boy lightly to punish him for telling
lies."</p>

<p>"You stunned him. He is dangerously ill," said Claudia,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Then how can he accuse me if he hasn't his senses about
him?"</p>

<p>"He recovered for a moment to say that you had struck him, and
he gave the reason why you did so."</p>

<p>"And the reason?" demanded the woman, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"You murdered your husband."</p>

<p>"Did he say that in those exact words?"</p>

<p>"No. He said that Mrs. Vence had murdered Sir Hector."</p>

<p>"Well, I am not Mrs. Vence, I am Lady Wyke."</p>

<p>"Rot!" said the sergeant, angrily. "What the deuce are you
wasting my time for in telling lies? You are Lady Wyke sure enough,
but you have been masquerading for some purpose as an old woman
under the name of Mrs. Vence."</p>

<p>"You can prove nothing against me, said Lady Wyke, sullenly.</p>

<p>"Yes, we can. An operation will restore young Mellin to health,
and his evidence will hang you."</p>

<p>"Hang me?" Lady Wyke shivered.</p>

<p>"Yes. There is no escape, But you had better not say any more. I
don't want to trap you into a confession. Get up and come along
with me. I must take you to Redleigh Goal."</p>

<p>"Oh," groaned the woman, looking at her handcuffs and then
wrathfully at the white face of Miss Lemby, "and to think that the
girl should get the better of me! But I'm not beaten yet."</p>

<p>"Here, get up and come along," said Purse, harshly, and bent to
lift her.</p>

<p>"Wait!" shrieked Lady Wyke, who now saw that there was indeed no
escape, and that the time had come for her to pay in full for her
wickedness. "I have a word to say first."</p>

<p>"Say it then," growled the officer, sharply, "and be quick about
it."</p>

<p>The captured woman thought for a few moments, and then began
with a sigh to confess her wickedness, and continued with frequent
sobs. Bad as she was, Claudia was quite sorry for her apparent
misery.</p>

<p>"I'll tell the truth," said Lady Wyke, in a melancholy tone, but
it became sharper when Purse began to recite his formula. "Don't
bother me," she said, tartly, "but take out your pocket-book and
note down what I say."</p>

<p>"I'm ready," said the sergeant, stolidly, when her command was
complied with. Lady Wyke nodded, looked at her fettered hands, and
shivered. "I never thought that I'd live to have these on," she
said, sullenly. "However, the game's up, and that girl yonder has
won. It's no use beating about the bush any longer. I did murder my
husband."</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped Claudia, shrinking and wincing.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the woman plaintively. "I killed him, with the
knife of your father. To begin at the beginning&mdash;" her voice
shook, but she made an effort and continued slowly "&mdash;when I
saw in America that Hector was going to marry you. Miss Lemby, I
came back to stop him from committing bigamy."</p>

<p>"He thought that you were dead."</p>

<p>"Well, I wasn't. I returned and saw Sandal to prove my identity.
I also learnt that the will made by Hector shortly after our
marriage, which left his property to me, was still in existence.
Then I interviewed Hector, and we had an unpleasant scene, as you
may guess. He did not want to tell you the truth immediately, but
wished for time to think over matters. To do so he proposed to go
into hiding in the country, because he was afraid lest your father
should come and worry him."</p>

<p>"My father did find him out," said Claudia, while Purse went on
busily taking notes. "He learnt from Edwin where Sir Hector
was."</p>

<p>"Add Edwin knew because his father was Rector of Hedgerton.
Well, than, as you may guess, I was not going to let my husband
give me the slip, so I said that I would go with him. He objected,
as he had fixed upon Maranatha, in Hedgerton, as his hiding-place,
and knew that I came from there. He did not wish my sister, who was
only a washerwoman, to know that I was his wife. I therefore said
that I would make myself up as an old woman, and go as his
housekeeper."</p>

<p>"And your husband consented to this absurd idea?" I asked Purse,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>Lady Wyke smiled drily. "He couldn't very well object, could
he," she demanded, "seeing that I had the inside running? Since he
was anxious to hide the truth about his first marriage from that
girl yonder, he had to do what I wished, as he knew that I could
give the show away.</p>

<p>"Well, then, being an actress, I was quite able to turn myself
into an old hag. I was Lady Wyke in London, but I arrived at
Maranatha as Mrs. Vence. Afterwards, when the house was more or
less ready, Hector arrived, and we pigged it there for some time.
Hector could not make up his mind to tell you of my reappearance,
Miss Lemby, and so dilly-dallied day after day. I kept mostly
indoors, while occasionally Hector walked out, although he
discouraged people calling, which was natural, considering he did
not feel inclined for company. I particularly refused to see my
sister, Mrs. Mellin, lest she should recognise me through my
disguise. But I got Neddy to bring the washing, and my nephew and I
became very friendly."</p>

<p>"Did he know, then, that you were his aunt?" asked Claudia, and
Purse mutely put the same question.</p>

<p>"No. He never knew at all that Mrs. Vence and Lady Wyke were one
and the same person, which said a good deal for my cleverness in
making-up."</p>

<p>"I never guessed myself," said Miss Lemby, shaking her head.</p>

<p>"Another tribute to my talents," cried Lady Wyke, ironically.
"Well, then, the whole reason why I disguised myself at Hector's
request, and watched him, was to prevent him from making another
will. I fancied that he wanted to leave the money to you, Miss
Lemby, and naturally I hated you. I pigged it as my husband's
housekeeper for some time, as you know, and watched him carefully.
Then, on that particular night Mr. Oliver Lemby arrived, and saw my
husband in the drawing-room. I then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a bit," broke in Purse. "Was the boy Mellin in the house
then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He arrived early with the washing, and was eating some
bread and honey in the kitchen. I excused myself, and left him
there while I went up to spy at the drawing-room door keyhole. I
wished to find out if Hector was saying anything about leaving the
money to you, Miss Lemby. I saw what I told you in London, when you
truly believed that I was Mrs. Vence. Your father threatened Hector
with his knife, and then came the ring at the door. I ran down to
open it, but did not know that the newcomer was Mr. Craver. While
he asked for my husband, Hector came running downstairs with your
father's knife in his hand. He pushed me aside, told me to go to
the kitchen and bring refreshments in a quarter of an hour, and
then took the stranger into his study. I did not go to the kitchen,
but listened. Then I heard Hector say that he intended to leave the
money to Mr. Craver, and knew that the stranger was Edwin.
Afterwards Hector conducted Mr. Craver into the dining-room to show
him some papers. What they were I don't know, and why they should
be in the dining-room I don't know either. But then Hector's papers
and letters were always all over the place. He was a most untidy
man.</p>

<p>"I stole into the study, and saw Mr. Lemby's knife on the table,
where Hector had left it. I was furious at the thought of Hector
making a new will and leaving the money to another person. The
devil entered into me, for I swear that I had no idea of killing
him until then. Hector came back for a moment and faced me as I was
holding the knife. Without waiting, I sent the knife straight into
his false heart. He gave a cry and fell. Then I heard Mr. Craver
move in the next room&mdash;the dining-room. I turned to fly, and
saw Neddy Mellin looking at me. He had seen all. I dragged him into
the kitchen, and made him promise to hold his tongue. He was
scared, and did so. Then, while Mr. Craver was bending over the
body, I came in with the tray and dropped it. The postman's
knock&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes!" said Purse, closing his pocket-book; "we know
all the rest. Mr. Craver escaped on the bicycle. Hall and Jervis
and Lemby arrived, and you played the innocent goat."</p>

<p>"She did more than that," said Claudia, looking very sick and
white. "She tried to implicate my father and Edwin when she knew
they were innocent."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was a part of my game," said Lady Wyke, lightly. "But
you know now why I went to buy a motor. It was to make Edwin's
acquaintance. Then Neddy gave me the letter he had taken from the
hall table, and I knew that I had the upper hand of your lover. I
must say that, seeing how I could have ruined him, he was brave to
stick to you, Claudia. As to that pirate Lemby&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough," said Sergeant Purse, suddenly. "I have heard
all that I want to hear. Now come to Redleigh Gaol."</p>

<p>"One minute," said Lady Wyke, staring across the water. "There
is the aeroplane, sergeant. Won't you wait for its arrival, and let
me say good-bye to the man I love, and for whose sake I have ruined
myself?"</p>

<p>"No. Come along," and Purse laid his hand lightly on her arm,
never thinking but what she would obey, "come to Redleigh
Gaol."</p>

<p>"Death rather!" shrieked Lady Wyke and, handcuffed as she was,
sprang down the path in a moment. How she kept, her balance was a
wonder but keep it she did, and before the two on the cliffs could
gather their senses together she was down on the beach. The
aeroplane came nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>"She means to drown herself!" cried Claudia, and sprang in
pursuit, while Purse, wholly taken by surprise, blew his whistle
loudly.</p>

<p>At once three or four men came running from the coastguard
station, and followed the sergeant down the path. But Claudia,
determined to prevent her rival from escaping punishment, was
already in pursuit. She soon dropped to the level of the beach, and
scrambled over the boulders on to the smooth sands. Lady Wyke was
speeding ahead like a swallow, but lingered when she saw Claudia at
her heels. The girl got within touching distance of her, when the
woman, with an insulting laugh, darted off again. Claudia followed
unthinkingly, and almost before she knew what had happened, found
herself in the middle of the fatal quicksands, which had been
pointed out to her by Neddy.</p>

<p>Lady Wyke was already sinking fast, and laughing loudly. "I've
got you; you are trapped! No Redleigh Gaol for me, and no Edwin for
you! I'm not beaten yet, I'm not beaten yet!"</p>

<p>Claudia shrieked as she felt herself in the grip of the cruel
sands. Purse and the coastguards uttered shouts of dismay, for it
appeared to be impossible to save the two women. At once two of the
men scrambled back up the cliff to get ropes and boards for the
rescue. But all the time Claudia and the rival who had lured her to
destruction were sinking deeper and deeper, Lady Wyke, in
particular, going down swiftly, as she had ran on to the sands
first. Claudia was following quickly. All at once both women heard
the buzz of the machine, and looked up to see the aeroplane
directly overhead. Edwin dropped swiftly downwards as he recognised
the peril, and soon came near enough to recognise who were in
danger. With a white face, but perfectly calm, he dropped the rope
coiled on the pilot seat, and guided the aeroplane down a short
distance above the heads of the two. Lady Wyke uttered a cry of
rage as she saw Claudia grasp the rope, and cling to it for dear
life.</p>

<p>"It's not fair; it's not fair!" she screamed. "She shan't be
saved! Me too; me too!" and she shook her ironbound hands
impotently at the aeroplane. Purse and his men looked on aghast,
for Lady Wyke was now up to her middle in the sand.</p>

<p>There was no word, from Craver, and no cry from Claudia. The
rope had dropped truly, and one end was in her hands, while the
other was fastened to the seat of the machine. Edwin kept his
engine going at full speed, swung low, and then curved for the
ascent. The rope tightened, there came a steady pull, and Claudia
was plucked from peril, just as the sands had her in their grip up
to the knees. With an angry, despairing cry, Lady Wyke saw her
hated rival swinging in the air and borne out of danger as the
aeroplane slanted skywards with a rush. Then the pilot descended
lower and lower gradually, until the rescued girl, now on firm
ground, was able to let go her hold. With a faint moan she did so,
and sank insensible on the sands, while the aeroplane rose in the
air to sweep upward majestically, to skim over the cliffs, and
finally to alight with a run near the barn.</p>

<p>But Lady Wyke saw nothing of this. Swiftly and surely the greedy
sands sucked her down into their depths. Her waist, her shoulders,
her neck disappeared, while the sergeant and the coastguards looked
on helplessly. With ropes and board the rescuers scrambled down the
cliffs just as the miserable woman's black head vanished for ever.
Without a sound, she went down into the halls of death, by a far
more cruel road than the one she had forced her husband to travel.
And when Claudia awoke from her death-like trance she was lying in
the sheltering arms of her lover.</p>

<p>"Lady Wyke?" she murmured, feebly. Edwin silently pointed to the
quicksands, which gleamed and glittered, and appeared to smile in
the evening light. There was not a sign of the evil woman who had
been swallowed up by them. And the incoming tide began to break in
little waves over her nameless grave.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_26" id=
"Chapter_26"></a>Chapter 26</b>
</h2>

<p>With the death of Lady Wyke and the discovery of her wickedness
came the end of trouble. There certainly remained a little to be
endured by those connected with the tragedy, for the whole strange
story was made public. That led to an invasion of Hedgerton by
reporters, photographers, and many morbid-minded people in search
of sensation. The Rectory was besieged, and Edwin, to protect
Claudia from worry, was compelled to grant interviews. The girl
herself remained in her room for some days, as she had received a
severe shock. But that did not prevent her portrait from appearing
in the illustrated papers, since it was procured from Mr.
Lemby.</p>

<p>The pirate was in his element. Far from disliking such publicity
he gloried in it, and turned it, to good account. Money was what he
wanted, and money was what he intended to get&mdash;as much as he
could conveniently screw of this person and that. He charged for
interviews; he had his photograph sold in the streets and in shops;
he swanked and swaggered all over the place with a view to impress
everyone with his importance. And he succeeded; for the case caused
such a sensation that an enterprising music-hall manager offered
the buccaneer an engagement at a large weekly salary. Mr. Lemby,
therefore, appeared in a kind of Captain Kidd costume to relate
wild adventures in the South Seas and in Australia. Both Edwin and
Claudia were horribly ashamed. As for Mrs. Craver, her indignation
knew no bounds.</p>

<p>"What kind of a man is this," she wrathfully demanded, "to have
such a daughter as you, Claudia? People didn't do these things when
I was a girl."</p>

<p>"It won't last long," replied Claudia with a sigh. "Very soon
the novelty will wear off, and then father will go back to
Australia."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I shall be glad." said the little lady, drawing
herself up in a dignified way. "And I don't mean any disrespect to
you, my dear, when I say so. You are a sweet girl, and will make
Edwin an ideal wife. Your father is fascinating in some ways, and
has many good qualities. All the same, he should not try and make
capital out of this dreadful case."</p>

<p>Claudia quite agreed with this view. But it was impossible to
stop the pirate from taking every advantage of what had happened.
As he had entered upon this new career within a week from the death
of Lady Wyke, he was absent from Hedgerton and did not remain to
worry her. That was something gained, as she had Edwin to herself,
and in many ways was perfectly happy. After the storm had come the
sunshine, and now that there was no bar to their union the young
couple determined to get married as soon as possible. Only when she
was Mrs. Craver junior did Claudia feel that she would be safe from
the vagaries of her piratical father.</p>

<p>The Rector and his wife were both shocked when they learnt the
truth. In fact, the whole parish was shocked, as everyone knew
Laura Bright, although, as Lady Wyke, she was a comparative
stranger to the friends of her youth. Poor Mrs. Mellin wept at the
outset over her sister's terrible fate; but when she learnt that it
was Laura that had tried to kill Neddy she dried her tears and
refused to mourn. People talked to her and asked questions, but the
old washerwoman behaved with great dignity, and declined to say a
word about the dead. She could not say good and she did not wish to
say bad, so she wisely held her tongue, and was greatly commended
for her reticence by Mrs. Craver, who approved of her attitude.</p>

<p>As for Neddy, he gradually recovered his health. An operation
restored his senses, and careful nursing at Redleigh Hospital did
the rest. In a remarkably short space of time, considering the
nature of the injury, he was quite his old bright, clever self.
Then Mrs. Mellin took him home again with the intention of keeping
him under her eye for the rest of her life. But the lad, having
tasted the joys of London, refused to remain at Hedgerton. As soon
as he was well enough he returned to town and sought out the
music-teacher with whom he had been placed by his dead aunt. The
man gladly took him in charge, and in due time Neddy appeared at
the Tit-Bits Music Hall with immense success. Known as "The
Skylark" he became quite a favourite, and made a great deal of
money. To his honour, it must be said that he gave the greater
portion of his earnings to his mother, and these she placed in a
bank to his credit, refusing to touch a shilling herself. The shock
sustained by the boy did him much good, as it sobered his
character, and gave him experience. On the whole, he turned out
very well, and Mrs. Mellin never regretted letting him have his own
way; with regard to the singing. And, like his mother, Neddy never
spoke of Lady Wyke. She was dead and buried in the quicksand, so
there was no more to be said.</p>

<p>The quicksand had a wonderful fascination for morbid people.
Many came down to Hedgerton during the summer for the express
purpose of staring at the terrible grave of the miserable woman.
Consequently all the lodging houses in Hedgerton were full, and the
season was the best, ever known. In fact, the publicity given to
the quiet little place by the tragedy induced strangers to come
down and stay there. When they found what a charming resort it was,
and how good the air was for nerves, many remained, and building
operations on a large scale took place. Within a few years the
locality was quite populous, so Lady Wyke did good for her native
village by her death, although she had done nothing for it while
living. But in this connection it may be mentioned that Maranatha
was pulled down. No one would rent it owing to its ill-omened
history, so it was finally destroyed, which was the most sensible
thing to be done. Its site became tea-gardens, and the proprietors
of these did a large business, notwithstanding the fact that many
people shook their heads and declared that even the ground was
accursed.</p>

<p>But all this improvement of Hedgerton, which made it a thriving
seaside resort, took place long after Claudia and her lover were
happily married. After the first shock was over, and the greedy
desire of the public for further details was satisfied, Edwin
broached the subject of marriage with Claudia in the drawing-room
of the Rectory. Mr. and Mrs. Craver were present and thoroughly
approved of their son's wish that the ceremony should take place as
soon as possible. They loved Claudia, and, sympathising greatly
with what she had gone through, were anxious to make her happy. And
what better fortune could they wish her than to be the wife of the
man she loved?</p>

<p>"I shall never be quite satisfied until I call you my wife,
darling," said the young man, fondly. "There is no reason why we
should not marry at once."</p>

<p>"I have no money," faltered Claudia, "and my father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind your father, my dear," interrupted little Mrs.
Craver. "If I have said anything about him to wound you, I'm sure
I'm very sorry. Let him go his own way, for he has many good
qualities. We want you. As to money, Edwin earns enough to keep you
in tolerable luxury."</p>

<p>"I don't want that, I want Edwin."</p>

<p>"You shall have both, dear. And as a wedding-present," added the
young man with a smile. "I am going to give you a promise that I
shall not fly any more."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Mrs. Craver, clasping her hands tightly, "I am glad.
Of course, I am used to it now, but really, Edwin, my heart is in
my mouth every time you go up in that horrid aeroplane."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't call it horrid, Mrs. Craver," expostulated Claudia,
hurriedly. "Think of how it saved my life. Nothing but the
aeroplane could have rescued me."</p>

<p>"Along with Edwin's presence of mind, of course," said the
Rector, thoughtfully. "And it was providential Edwin, that you took
that coil of rope along with you, otherwise&mdash;" He shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Otherwise I should have gone down with Lady Wyke," said
Claudia, trembling.</p>

<p>"Don't talk of her dear," said Mrs. Craver, trembling also. "I
wish to forget Laura Bright entirely. To think of her wickedness in
luring you on to that quicksand! It was cruelly clever. She meant
to kill you."</p>

<p>Edwin nodded. "I suppose the sight of the quicksands from the
top of the path suggested that way of hurting Claudia," he
remarked. "Handcuffed as she was, Lady Wyke saw no other way of
getting even with us. And it was wonderful to think how she got
down that steep path without breaking her neck."</p>

<p>"Didn't you guess what she intended to do, Claudia?" asked the
Rector.</p>

<p>"No. I ran after her believing that she intended to throw
herself into the sea and escape punishment. But she waited until I
nearly reached her, and then ran fairly into the quicksand. I
followed unthinkingly, and then&mdash;" The girl shivered, for the
recollection of her escape was very dreadful.</p>

<p>"Don't let us talk any more about it," said Edwin,
soothingly.</p>

<p>They could not, for at that moment a visitor was announced. This
was none other than Mr. Sandal, who stalked into the drawing-room,
tall, thin, and dried up in his looks. Edwin and Claudia were
surprised to see him, and when he was introduced to the Rector and
Mrs. Craver they looked at him apprehensively. He saw their dismay,
and smiled in his dry way.</p>

<p>"I am not always a bird of ill-omen, Mr. Craver," he said to
Edwin; "and on this occasion I come as the dove of peace rather
than as the raven of misfortune."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the young man, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I mean," said the solicitor, taking an official-looking
document out of his pocket, "that I have here the will of Lady Wyke
made in your favour."</p>

<p>"Oh, but that was all nonsense," said Craver, quite taken aback.
"Lady Wyke only told me that she made a will in my favour to trick
me into marriage. I did not know, until Claudia here explained,
that marriage destroyed a will."</p>

<p>"It does, Mr. Craver; but, as no marriage took place, this will
holds good. It was none of my business to contradict my late
client; and, as she insisted on making you her heir, she did so. Of
course," added the lawyer quietly, "I did not know that she
intended to marry you, or I should have pointed out that the will
should be executed after the ceremony."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Sandal," asked Claudia, impatiently, "what does it
mean?"</p>

<p>"It means that Mr. Craver here inherits five thousand a year."
There were exclamations, and everyone looked startled. "I won't
take a penny of that miserable woman's money!" cried Edwin,
violently.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Edwin!" said Mrs. Craver, sensibly. "You will
do move good with the money than she ever did. Take what you can
get, and be thankful."</p>

<p>"What do you say, father?"</p>

<p>"I say accept, my son. Although she did not mean it. Providence,
in a wonderful way, has guided her to make reparation to you and to
Claudia for all the misery she has brought on you."</p>

<p>"Claudia?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say," said the girl, nervously. "I leave
it to you, Edwin."</p>

<p>"Be wise, my dear sir; be wise," warned Sandal, seeing the young
man still hesitate.</p>

<p>"I accept," said Edwin, after a few moments' thought. "After
all, I have acted honourably, and there is no reason why I should
be quixotic."</p>

<p>"None in the world," said Sandal, drily. "I congratulate you on
your good sense, Mr. Craver. Come up to town when you can, and I
shall place you in possession of the property." He rose to go.</p>

<p>"Stay to dinner," urged the Rector, hospitably.</p>

<p>"No, my dear sir, no. I have to return to London at once. The
trap which brought me from Redleigh is waiting to take me back
again. I hope to come down on another and still happier
occasion."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked little Mrs. Craver, sharply.</p>

<p>"When Miss Lemby and Mr. Craver are married," complimented the
old lawyer, with a courtly bow, and took his leave in his usual
stately fashion.</p>

<p>Amidst the loud congratulations of the Rector and his wife on
the great wealth which had come to them, the young couple saw the
friendly lawyer down to the gate.</p>

<p>Sandal refused to say a word about Lady Wyke, even though Edwin
gave him a hint. He stepped into Sanky's trap and drove off,
leaving two very happy people behind him.</p>

<p>"Five thousand a year!" said Claudia, drawing a deep breath. "I
can scarcely believe it. Why do you laugh, Edwin?"</p>

<p>"My darling, I was thinking how annoyed your father will be. He
schemed for this money, and has lost it. We have not schemed, and
it has come to us."</p>

<p>Claudia laughed also, "I really cannot sympathise with dad," she
observed. "I tell you what, Edwin. After dad gets over this
music-hall craze of his, let us allow him an income, on condition
that he goes to Australia. He will be much happier there, while he
will only worry us here. I hope," ended Claudia, remorsefully,
"that I am not a bad daughter in saying this?"</p>

<p>"'No, dear, no." Edwin petted her. "Your father is a trial, and
is one of those parents who make one wonder why the fifth
commandment was ever given."</p>

<p>"He means well, Edwin."</p>

<p>"To himself he does. No, Claudia, don't try to cry up your
father's virtues, for he has very, very few. I shall be glad to see
the last of him, and so will you."</p>

<p>Claudia could not deny this, and they leant comfortably over the
gate to talk of more agreeable subjects.</p>

<p>"What will you do with all this money?" said the girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is easily settled," said her lover, putting his arm
round her waist. "First we get married; second, we shall go a trip
round the world for a couple of years, so as to make us forget all
these terrible troubles. Then we shall return when your father is
safely settled in Australia, and build a house near this rectory. I
shall go back to the motor factory, and live the steady life of a
business man who has a charming wife to welcome him home."</p>

<p>"And you won't fly any more, Edwin."</p>

<p>"No; never again. The aeroplane will go back to town by rail.
Seeing what happiness has come to us, I shall not tempt Providence.
Hullo, here's the post!" It was indeed Hall, who came up the road
on his bicycle. Edwin took the letters, which were all for the
Rector. After a word or two, the postman got on his machine, and
moved swiftly away. Edwin watched the red bicycle pass out of
sight. "A machine like that saved my life," he said, gravely. "If I
hadn't got away on that night I should have been hanged by this
time."</p>

<p>Claudia threw her arms round his neck. "Don't Edwin! Let us try
and forget all about that terrible time. Come inside."</p>

<p>"All right. We can pass the evening along with father and
mother, building castles in the air."</p>

<p>"Come in, dear, come in. I never wish to see a red bicycle
again."</p>

<p>"Nor do I," said the young man, laughing; "but we can't abolish
postmen, you know, dearest. There, I shan't say another word. All
our trouble has gone down the road with the red bicycle. And
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now I have you, and you have me," said Claudia, with a kiss.
"Come inside."</p>
