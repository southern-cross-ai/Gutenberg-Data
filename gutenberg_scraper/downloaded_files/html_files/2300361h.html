<hr>

<p class="first">THIS is a tale that might be told in many ways
and from various points of view; it has to be gathered from here
and there&mdash;a letter, a report, a diary, a casual reference;
in its day the thing was more than a passing wonder, and it left
a mark of abiding horror on the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The house in which Mr. Orford lived has finally been
destroyed, the mural tablet in St. Paul's, Covent Garden, may be
sought for in vain by the curious, but little remains of the old
piazza where the quiet scholar passed on his daily walks, the
very records of what was once so real have become blurred, almost
incoherent in their pleadings with things forgotten; but this
thing happened to real people, in a real London, not so long ago
that the generation had not spoken with those who remembered some
of the actors in this terrible drama.</p>

<p>It is round the person of Humphrey Orford that this tale
turns, as, at the time, all the mystery and horror centered; yet
until his personality was brought thus tragically into fame, he
had not been an object of much interest to many; he had, perhaps,
a mild reputation for eccentricity, but this was founded merely
on the fact that he refused to partake of the amusements of his
neighbors, and showed a dislike for much company.</p>

<p>But this was excused on the ground of his scholarly
predilections; he was known to be translating, in a leisurely
fashion, as became a gentleman, Ariosto's great romance into
English couplets, and to be writing essays on recondite subjects
connected with grammar and language, which were not the less
esteemed because they had never been published.</p>

<p>His most authentic portrait, taken in 1733 and intended for a
frontispiece for the Ariosto when this should come to print,
shows a slender man with reddish hair, rather severely clubbed, a
brown coat, and a muslin cravat; he looks straight out of the
picture, and the face is long, finely shaped, and refined, with
eyebrows rather heavier than one would expect from such delicacy
of feature.</p>

<p>When this picture was painted Mr. Orford was living near
Covent Garden, close to the mansion once occupied by the famous
Dr. Radcliffe, a straight-fronted, dark house of obvious
gentility, with a little architrave portico over the door and a
few steps leading up to it; a house with neat windows and a
gloomy air, like every other residence in that street and most
other streets of the same status in London.</p>

<p>And if there was nothing remarkable about Mr. Orford's
dwelling place or person there was nothing, as far as his
neighbors knew, remarkable about his history.</p>

<p>He came from a good Suffolk family, in which county he was
believed to have considerable estates (though it was a known fact
that he never visited them), and he had no relations, being the
only child of an only child, and his parents dead; his father had
purchased this town house in the reign of King William, when the
neighborhood was very fashionable, and up to it he had come,
twenty years ago&mdash;nor had he left it since.</p>

<p>He had brought with him an ailing wife, a house-keeper, and a
man-servant, and to the few families of his acquaintance near,
who waited on him, he explained that he wished to give young Mrs.
Orford, who was of a mopish disposition, the diversion of a few
months in town.</p>

<p>But soon there was no longer this motive for remaining in
London, for the wife, hardly seen by anyone, fell into a short
illness and died&mdash;just a few weeks after her husband had
brought her up from Suffolk. She was buried very simply in St.
Paul's, and the mural tablet set up with a draped urn in marble,
and just her name and the date, ran thus:</p>

<br>

<p class="smcap" style="text-align:center">
Flora, Wife of Humphrey Orford, Esq.,<br>
of this Parish,<br>
Died November, 1713, Aged 27 Years.</p><br>

<br>

<p>Mr. Orford made no effort to leave the house; he remained,
people thought, rather stunned by his loss, kept himself close in
the house, and for a considerable time wore deep mourning.</p>

<p>But this was twenty years ago, and all had forgotten the
shadowy figure of the young wife, whom so few had seen and whom
no one had known anything about or been interested in, and all
trace of her seemed to have passed out of the quiet, regular, and
easy life of Mr. Orford, when an event that gave rise to some
gossip caused the one-time existence of Flora Orford to be
recalled and discussed among the curious. This event was none
other than the sudden betrothal of Mr. Orford and the
announcement of his almost immediate marriage.</p>

<p>The bride was one who had been a prattling child when the
groom had first come to London: one old lady who was forever at
her window watching the little humors of the street recollected
and related how she had seen Flora Orford, alighting from the
coach that had brought her from the country, turn to this child,
who was gazing from the railing of the neighboring house, and
touch her bare curls lovingly and yet with a sad gesture.</p>

<p>And that was about the only time anyone ever did see Flora
Orford, she so soon became ailing; and the next the inquisitive
old lady saw of her was the slender brown coffin being carried
through the dusk towards St. Paul's Church.</p>

<p>But that was twenty years ago, and here was the baby grown up
into Miss Elisa Minden, a very personable young woman, soon to be
the second Mrs. Humphrey Orford. Of course there was nothing very
remarkable about the match; Elisa's father, Dr. Minden, had been
Mr. Orford's best friend (as far as he could be said to have a
best friend, or indeed any friend at all) for many a long year,
both belonged to the same quiet set, both knew all about each
other. Mr. Orford was not much above forty-five or so, an
elegant, well-looking man, wealthy, with no vices and a calm,
equable temper; while Miss Elisa, though pretty and
well-mannered, had an insufficient dowry, no mother to fend for
her, and the younger sisters to share her slender advantages. So
what could anyone say save that the good doctor had done very
well for his daughter, and that Mr. Orford had been fortunate
enough to secure such a fresh, capable maiden for his wife?</p>

<p>It was said that the scholar intended giving up his bookish
ways&mdash;that he even spoke of going abroad a while, to Italy,
for preference; he was of course, anxious to see Italy, as all
his life had been devoted to preparing the translation of an
Italian classic.</p>

<p>The quiet betrothal was nearing its decorous conclusion when
one day Mr. Orford took Miss Minden for a walk and brought her
home round the piazza of Covent Garden, then took her across the
cobbled street, past the stalls banked up with the first spring
flowers (it was the end of March), under the portico built by the
great Inigo Jones, and so into the church.</p>

<p>"I want to show you where my wife Flora lies buried," said Mr.
Orford.</p>

<p>And that is really the beginning of the story.</p>

<p>Now, Miss Minden had been in this church every Sunday of her
life and many weekdays, and had been used since a child to see
that tablet to Flora Orford; but when she heard these words in
the quiet voice of her lover and felt him draw her out of the
sunlight into the darkness of the church, she experienced a great
distaste that was almost fear.</p>

<p>It seemed to her both a curious and a disagreeable thing for
him to do, and she slipped her arm out of his as she replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, please let us go home!" she said. "Father will be waiting
for us, and your good Mrs. Boyd vexed if the tea is
over-brewed."</p>

<p>"But first I must show this," he insisted, and took her arm
again and led her down the church, past his seat, until they
stood between his pew end and the marble tablet in the wall which
was just a hand's space above their heads.</p>

<p>"That is to her memory," said Mr. Orford. "And you see there
is nothing said as to her virtues."</p>

<p>Now, Elisa Minden knew absolutely nothing of her predecessor,
and could not tell if these words were spoken in reverence or
irony, so she said nothing but looked up rather timidly from
under the shade of her Leghorn straw at the tall figure of her
lover, who was staring sternly at the square of marble.</p>

<p>"And what have you to say to Flora Orford?" he asked sharply,
looking down at her quickly.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, she was a stranger to me," replied Miss Minden. Mr.
Orford pressed her arm.</p>

<p>"But to me she was a wife," he said. "She is buried under your
feet. Quite close to where you are standing. Why, think of that,
Lizzie, if she could stand up and put out her hand she could
catch hold of your dress&mdash;she is as near as that!"</p>

<p>The words and his manner of saying them filled Miss Minden
with shuddering terror, for she was a sensitive and fanciful
girl, and it seemed to her a dreadful thing to be thus standing
over the bones of the poor creature who had loved the man who was
now to be her husband, and horrible to think that the handful of
decay so near them had once clung to this man and loved him.</p>

<p>"Do not tremble, my dear girl," said Mr. Orford. "She is
dead."</p>

<p>Tears were in Elisa Minden's eyes, and she answered
coldly:</p>

<p>"Sir, how can you speak so?"</p>

<p>"She was a wicked woman," he replied, "a very wicked
woman."</p>

<p>The girl could not reply as to that; this sudden disclosing of
a painful secret abashed her simple mind.</p>

<p>"Need we talk of this?" she asked; then, under her
breath&mdash;"Need we be married in this church, sir?"</p>

<p>"Of course," he answered shortly, "everything is arranged.
Tomorrow week."</p>

<p>Miss Minden did not respond; hitherto she had been fond of the
church, now it seemed spoilt for her&mdash;tarnished by the
thought of Flora Orford.</p>

<p>Her companion seemed to divine what reflection lay behind her
silence.</p>

<p>"You need not be afraid," he said rather harshly. "She is
dead. Dead."</p>

<p>And he reached out the light cane he wore and tapped on the
stone above his wife's grave, and slowly smiled as the sound rang
hollow in the vaults beneath.</p>

<p>Then he allowed Elisa to draw him away, and they returned to
Mr. Orford's comfortable house, where in the upper parlor Dr.
Minden was awaiting them together with his sister and her son, a
soldier cousin whom the quick perceptions of youthful friends had
believed to be devoted to Elisa Minden. They made a pleasant
little party with the red curtains drawn, and the fire burning up
between the polished andirons and all the service for tea laid
out with scones and Naples cake, and Mrs. Boyd coming to and fro
with plates and dishes. And everyone was cheerful and friendly
and glad to be indoors together, with a snowstorm coming up and
people hurrying home with heads bent before a cutting wind.</p>

<p>But to Elisa's mind had come an unbidden thought:</p>

<p>"I do not like this house&mdash;it is where Flora Orford
died."</p>

<p>And she wondered in which room, and also why this had never
occurred to her before, and glanced rather thoughtfully at the
fresh young face of the soldier cousin as he stood by the fire in
his scarlet and white, with his glance on the flames.</p>

<p>But it was a cheerful party, and Elisa smiled and jested with
the rest as she reserved the dishes at tea.</p>

<p>There is a miniature of her painted about this time, and one
may see how she looked with her bright brown hair and bright
brown eyes, rosy complexion, pretty nose and mouth, and her best
gown of lavender blue tabinet with a lawn tucker and a lawn cap
fastened under the chin with frilled lappets, showing how the big
Leghorn hat with the velvet strings was put aside.</p>

<p>Mr. Orford also looked well tonight; he did not look his full
age in the ruddy candle glow, the grey did not show in his
abundant hair nor the lines in his fine face, but the elegance of
his figure, the grace of his bearing, the richness of his simple
clothes, were displayed to full advantage; Captain Hoare looked
stiff and almost clumsy by contrast.</p>

<p>But now and then Elisa Minden's eyes would rest rather
wistfully on the fresh face of this young man who had no dead
wife in his life. And something was roused in her meek youth and
passive innocence, and she wondered why she had so quietly
accepted her father's arrangement of a marriage with this elderly
scholar, and why Philip Hoare had let her do it. Her thoughts
were quite vague and amounted to no more than a confused sense
that something was wrong, but she lost her satisfaction in the
tea-drinking and the pleasant company, and the warm room with the
drawn curtains, and the bright fire, and rose up saying they must
be returning, as there was a great store of mending she had
promised to help her aunt with; but Mrs. Hoare would not help her
out, but protested, laughing, that there was time enough for
that, and the good doctor, who was in a fine humor and in no mood
to go out into the bleak streets even as far as his own door,
declared that now was the time they must be shown over the
house.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Humphrey," he said, "you have often promised us
this, but never done it, and, all the years that I have known
you, I have never seen but this room and the dining-room below;
and as to your own particular cabinet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Orford, interrupting in a leisurely fashion,
"no one has been in there, save Mrs. Boyd now and then, to
announce a visitor."</p>

<p>"Oh, you scholars!" smiled the doctor. "A secretive
tribe&mdash;and a fortunate one; why, in my poor room I have had
three girls running to and fro!"</p>

<p>The soldier spoke, not so pleasantly as his uncle.</p>

<p>"What have you so mysterious, sir, in this same cabinet, that
it must be so jealously guarded?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, nothing mysterious," smiled the scholar; "only my books,
and papers, and pictures."</p>

<p>"You will show them to me?" asked Elisa Minden, and her lover
gave graceful consent; there was further amiable talk, and then
the whole party, guided by Mr. Orford holding a candle, made a
tour of the house and looked over the fine rooms.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hoare took occasion to whisper to the bride-to-be that
there were many alterations needed before the place was ready for
a lady's use, and that it was time these were put in
hand&mdash;why, the wedding was less than a fortnight off!</p>

<p>And Elisa Minden, who had not had a mother to advise her in
these matters, suddenly felt that the house was dreary and
old-fashioned, and an impossible place to live in; the very rooms
that had so pleased her good father&mdash;a set of apartments for
a lady&mdash;were to her the most hateful in the house, for they,
her lover told her, had been furnished and prepared for Flora
Orford, twenty years ago.</p>

<p>She was telling herself that when she was married she must at
once go away and that the house must be altered before she could
return to it, when the party came crowding to the threshold of
the library or private cabinet, and Mr. Orford, holding the
candle aloft, led them in. Then as this illumination was not
sufficient, he went very quickly and lit the two candles on the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant apartment, lined with books from floor to
ceiling, old, valuable, and richly bound books, save only in the
space above the chimney piece, which was occupied by a portrait
of a lady and the panel behind the desk; this was situated in a
strange position, in the farthest corner of the room fronting the
wall, so that anyone seated there would be facing the door with
the space of the room between; the desk was quite close to the
wall, so that there was only just space for the chair at which
the writer would sit, and to accommodate this there were no
bookshelves behind it, but a smooth panel of wood on which hung a
small picture; this was a rough, dark painting, and represented a
man hanging on a gallows on a wild heath; it was a subject out of
keeping with the luxurious room with its air of ease and
learning, and while Mr. Orford was showing his first editions,
his Elzevirs and Aldines, Elisa Minden was staring at this ugly
little picture.</p>

<p>As she looked she was conscious of such a chill of horror and
dismay as nearly caused her to shriek aloud. The room seemed to
her to be full of an atmosphere of terror and evil beyond
expression. Never had such a thing happened to her before; her
visit to the tomb in the afternoon had been as nothing to this.
She moved away, barely able to disguise an open panic. As she
turned, she half-stumbled against a chair, caught at it, and
noticed, hanging over the back, a skirt of peach-colored silk.
Elisa, not being mistress of herself, caught at this garment.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," cried she hysterically, "what is this?"</p>

<p>All turned to look at her; her tone, her obvious fright, were
out of proportion to her discovery.</p>

<p>"Why, child," said Mrs. Hoare, "it is a silk petticoat, as all
can see."</p>

<p>"A gift for you, my dear," said the cheerful doctor.</p>

<p>"A gift for me?" cried Elisa. "Why, this has been scoured, and
turned, and mended, and patched a hundred times!"</p>

<p>And she held up the skirt, which had indeed become like tinder
and seemed ready to drop to pieces.</p>

<p>The scholar now spoke.</p>

<p>"It belongs to Mrs. Boyd," he said quietly. "I suppose she had
been in here to clean up, and has left some of her mending."</p>

<p>Now, two things about this speech made a strange impression on
everyone; first, it was manifestly impossible that the good
housekeeper would ever have owned such a garment as this, that
was a lady's dress and such as would be worn for a ball;
secondly, Mr. Orford had only a short while before declared that
Mrs. Boyd only entered his room when he was in it, and then of a
necessity and for a few minutes.</p>

<p>All had the same impression, that this was some garment
belonging to his dead wife and as such cherished by him; all,
that is, but Elisa, who had heard him call Flora Orford a wicked
woman.</p>

<p>She put the silk down quickly (there was a needle sticking
into it and a spool of cotton lying on the chair beneath) and
looked up at the portrait above the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"Is that Mrs. Orford?" she asked.</p>

<p>He gave her a queer look.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>In a strange silence all glanced up at the picture.</p>

<p>It showed a young woman in a white gown, holding a crystal
heart that hung round her neck; she had dark hair and a pretty
face; as Elisa looked at the pointed fingers holding the pretty
toy, she thought of the tablet in St. Paul's Church and Mr.
Orford's words&mdash;"She is so near to you that if she could
stretch out her hand she could touch you," and without any remark
about the portrait or the sitter, she advised her aunt that it
was time to go home. So the four of them left, and Mr. Orford saw
them out, standing framed in the warm light of the corridor and
watching them disappear into the grey darkness of the street.</p>

<p>It was a little more than an hour afterwards when Elisa Minden
came creeping down the stairway of her home and accosted her
cousin, who was just leaving the house.</p>

<p>"Oh, Philip," said she, clasping her hands, "if your errand be
not a very important one, I beg you to give me an hour of your
time. I have been watching for you to go out, that I might follow
and speak to you privately."</p>

<p>The young soldier looked at her keenly as she stood in the
light of the hall lamp, and he saw that she was very
agitated.</p>

<p>"Of course, Lizzie," he answered kindly, and led her into the
little parlor off the hall where there was neither candles or
fire, but leisure and quiet to talk.</p>

<p>Elisa, being a housekeeper, found a lamp and lit it, and
apologized for the cold, but she would not return upstairs, she
said, for Mrs. Hoare and the two girls and the doctor were all
quiet in the great parlor, and she had no mind to disturb
them.</p>

<p>"You are in trouble," said Captain Hoare quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied she in a frightened way, "I want you to come
with me now to Mr. Orford's house&mdash;I want to speak to his
housekeeper."</p>

<p>"Why, what is this, Lizzie?"</p>

<p>She had no very good explanation; there was only the visit to
the church that afternoon, her impression of horror in the
cabinet, the discovery of the scoured silk.</p>

<p>"But I must know something of his first wife, Philip," she
concluded. "I could never go on with it&mdash;if I did
not&mdash;something has happened today&mdash;I hate that house, I
almost hate&mdash;him."</p>

<p>"Why did you do it, Lizzie?" demanded the young soldier
sternly. "This was a nice homecoming for me...a man who might be
your father...a solitary...one who frightens you."</p>

<p>Miss Minden stared at her cousin; she did not know why she had
done it; the whole thing seemed suddenly impossible.</p>

<p>"Please, you must come with me now," she said.</p>

<p>So overwrought was she that he had no heart to refuse her, and
they took their warm cloaks from the hall and went out into the
dark streets.</p>

<p>It was snowing now and the ground slippery under foot, and
Elisa clung to her cousin's arm. She did not want to see Mr.
Orford or his house ever again, and by the time they reached the
doorstep she was in a tremble; but she rang the bell boldly.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Boyd herself who came to the door; she began
explaining that the master was shut up in his cabinet, but the
soldier cut her short.</p>

<p>"Miss Minden wishes to see you," he said, "and I will wait in
the hall till she is ready."</p>

<p>So Elisa followed the housekeeper down to her basement
sitting-room; the man-servant was out, and the two maids were
quickly dismissed to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyd, a placid soul, near seventy-years, waited for the
young lady to explain herself, and Elisa Minden, flushing and
paling by turns, and feeling foolish and timid, put forth the
object of her coming.</p>

<p>She wanted to hear the story of Flora Orford&mdash;there was
no one else whom she could ask&mdash;and she thought that she had
a right to know.</p>

<p>"And I suppose you have, my dear," said Mrs. Boyd, gazing into
the fire, "though it is not a pretty story for you to
hear&mdash;and I never thought I should be telling it to Mr.
Orford's second wife!"</p>

<p>"Not his wife yet." said Miss Minden.</p>

<p>"There, there, you had better ask the master yourself,"
replied Mrs. Boyd placidly; "not but that he would be fierce at
your speaking of it, for I do not think a mention of it has
passed his lips, and it's twenty years ago and best forgotten, my
dear."</p>

<p>"Tell it me and then I will forget," begged Miss Minden.</p>

<p>So then Mrs. Boyd, who was a quiet, harmless soul with no
dislike to telling a tale (though no gossip, as events had
proved, she having kept her tongue still on this matter for so
long), told her story of Humphrey Orford's wife; it was told in
very few words.</p>

<p>"She was the daughter of his gamekeeper, my dear, and he
married her out of hand, just for her pretty face. But they were
not very happy together that I could ever see; she was afraid of
him and that made her cringe, and he hated that, and she shamed
him with her ignorant ways. And then one day he found her with a
lover, saving your presence, mistress, one of her own people,
just a common man. And he was just like a creature possessed; he
shut up the house and sent away all the servants but me, and
brought his lady up to town, to this house here. And what passed
between her and him no one will know, but she ever looked like
one dying of terror. And then the doctor began to come, Dr.
Thursby, it was, that is dead now, and then she died, and no one
was able to see her even she was in her coffin, nor to send a
flower. 'Tis likely she died of grief, poor, fond wretch. But, of
course, she was a wicked woman, and there was nothing to do but
pity the master."</p>

<p>And this was the story of Flora Orford.</p>

<p>"And the man?" asked Miss Minden, after a little.</p>

<p>"The man she loved, my dear? Well, Mr. Orford had him arrested
as a thief for breaking into his house, he was wild, that fellow,
with not the best of characters&mdash;well, he would not say why
he was in the house, and Mr. Orford, being a Justice of the
Peace, had some power, so he was just condemned as a common
thief. And there are few to this day know the truth of the tale,
for he kept his counsel to the last, and no one knew from him why
he had been found in the Squire's house."</p>

<p>"What was his end?" asked Miss Minden in a still voice.</p>

<p>"Well, he was hanged," said Mrs. Boyd; "being caught
red-handed, what could he hope for?"</p>

<p>"Then that is a picture of him in the cabinet!" cried Elisa,
shivering for all the great fire; then she added desperately,
"Tell me, did Flora Orford die in that cabinet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my dear, but in a great room at the back of the house
that has been shut up ever since."</p>

<p>"But the cabinet is horrible," said Elisa; "perhaps it is her
portrait and that picture."</p>

<p>"I have hardly been in there," admitted Mrs. Boyd, "but the
master lives there&mdash;he has always had his supper there, and
he talks to that portrait my dear&mdash;'Flora, Flora' he says,
'how are you tonight?' and then he imitates her voice,
answering."</p>

<p>Elisa Minden clapped her hand to her heart.</p>

<p>"Do not tell me these things or I shall think that you are
hateful too, to have stayed in this dreadful house and endured
them!" Mrs. Boyd was surprised.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear, do not be put out," she protested.</p>

<p>"They were wicked people both of them and got their deserts,
and it is an old story best forgotten; and as for the master, he
has been just a good creature ever since we have been here, and
he will not go talking to any picture when he has a sweet young
wife to keep him company."</p>

<p>But Elisa Minden had risen and had her fingers on the handle
of the door.</p>

<p>"One thing more," said she breathlessly; "that scoured
silk&mdash;of a peach color&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, has he got that still? Mrs. Orford wore it the night he
found her with her sweetheart. I mind I was with her when she
bought it&mdash;fine silk at forty shillings the yard. If I were
you, my dear, I should burn that when I was mistress here."</p>

<p>But Miss Minden had run upstairs to the cold hall.</p>

<p>Her cousin was not there; she heard angry voices overhead and
saw the two maid-servants affrighted on the stairs; a disturbance
was unknown in this household.</p>

<p>While Elisa stood bewildered, a door banged, and Captain Hoare
came down red in the face and fuming; he caught his cousin's arm
and hurried her out of the house.</p>

<p>In an angry voice he told her of the unwarrantable behavior of
Mr. Orford, who had found him in the hall and called him
"intruder" and "spy" without waiting for an explanation; the
soldier had followed the scholar up to his cabinet and there had
been an angry scene about nothing at all, as Captain Hoare
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Philip," broke out poor Elisa as they hastened through
the cold darkness, "I can never, never marry him!"</p>

<p>And she told him the story of Flora Orford. The young man
pressed her arm through the heavy cloak.</p>

<p>"And how came such a one to entangle thee?" he asked tenderly.
"Nay, thou shalt not marry him."</p>

<p>They spoke no more, but Elisa, happy in the protecting and
wholesome presence of her kinsman, sobbed with a sense of relief
and gratitude. When they reached home they found they had been
missed and there had to be explanations; Elisa said there was
something that she had wished to say to Mrs. Boyd, and Philip
told of Mr. Orford's rudeness and the quarrel that had
followed.</p>

<p>The two elder people were disturbed and considered Elisa's
behavior strange, but her manifest agitation caused them to
forbear pressing her for an explanation; nor was it any use
addressing themselves to Philip, for he went out to his delayed
meeting with companions at a coffee-house.</p>

<p>That night Elisa Minden went to bed feeling more emotion than
she had ever done in her life; fear and disgust of the man whom
hitherto she had placidly regarded as her future husband, and a
yearning for the kindly presence of her childhood's companion
united in the resolute words she whispered into her pillow during
that bitter night.</p>

<p>"I can never marry him now!"</p>

<p>The next day it snowed heavily, yet a strange elation was in
Elisa's heart as she descended to the warm parlor, bright from
the fire and light from the glow of the snow without.</p>

<p>She was going to tell her father that she could not carry out
her engagement with Mr. Orford, and that she did not want ever to
go into his house again.</p>

<p>They were all gathered round the breakfast-table when Captain
Hoare came in late (he had been out to get a newsletter) and
brought the news that was the most unlooked for they could
conceive, and that was soon to startle all London.</p>

<p>Mr. Orford had been found murdered in his cabinet.</p>

<p>These tidings, though broken as carefully as possible, threw
the little household into the deepest consternation and
agitation; there were shrieks, and cryings, and running to and
fro.</p>

<p>Only Miss Minden, though of a ghastly color, made no especial
display of grief; she was thinking of Flora Orford.</p>

<p>When the doctor could get away from his agitated womenkind, he
went with his nephew to the house of Mr. Orford.</p>

<p>The story of the murder was a mystery. The scholar had been
found in his chair in front of his desk with one of his own
bread-knives sticking through his shoulders; and there was
nothing to throw any light as to how or through whom he had met
his death.</p>

<p>The story, sifted from the mazed incoherency of Mrs. Boyd, the
hysterics of the maids, the commentaries of the constables, and
the chatter of the neighbors, ran thus:</p>

<p>At half-past nine the night before, Mrs. Boyd had sent one of
the maids up with her master's supper; it was his whim to have it
always thus, served on a tray in the cabinet. There had been wine
and meat, bread and cheese, fruit and cakes&mdash;the usual
plates and silver&mdash;among these the knife that had killed Mr.
Orford.</p>

<p>When the servant left, the scholar had followed her to the
door and locked it after her; this was also a common practice of
his, a precaution against any possible interruption, for, he
said, he did the best part of his work in the evening.</p>

<p>It was found next morning that his bed had not been slept in,
and that the library door was still locked; as the alarmed Mrs.
Boyd could get no answer to her knocks, the man-servant had sent
for someone to force the lock, and Humphrey Orford had been found
in his chair, leaning forward over his papers with the knife
thrust up to the hilt between his shoulders; he must have died
instantly, for there was no sign of any struggle, nor any
disarrangement of his person or his papers. The first doctor to
see him, a passer-by, attracted by the commotion about the house,
said he must have been dead some hours&mdash;probably since the
night before; the candles had all burnt down to the socket, and
there were spillings of grease on the desk; the supper tray stood
at the other end of the room, most of the food had been eaten,
most of the wine drunk, the articles were all there in order
excepting only the knife sticking between Mr. Orford's
shoulder-blades.</p>

<p>When Captain Hoare had passed the house on his return from
buying the newsletter he had seen the crowd and gone in and been
able to say that he had been the last person to see the murdered
man alive, as he had had his sharp encounter with Mr. Orford
about ten o'clock, and he remembered seeing the supper things in
the room. The scholar had heard him below, unlocked the door, and
called out such impatient resentment of his presence that Philip
had come angrily up the stairs and followed him into the cabinet;
a few angry words had passed, when Mr. Orford had practically
pushed his visitor out, locking the door in his face and bidding
him take Miss Minden home.</p>

<p>This threw no light at all on the murder; it only went to
prove that at ten o'clock Mr. Orford had been alive in his
cabinet.</p>

<p>Now here was the mystery; in the morning the door was still
locked, on the inside, the window was, as it had been since early
evening, shuttered and fastened across with an iron bar, on the
inside, and, the room being on an upper floor, access would have
been in any case almost impossible by the window which gave on to
the smooth brickwork of the front of the house.</p>

<p>Neither was there any possible place in the room where anyone
might be hidden&mdash;it was just the square lined with the
shallow bookshelves, the two pictures (that sombre little one
looking strange now above the bent back of the dead man), the
desk, one or two chairs and side tables; there was not so much as
a cupboard or bureau&mdash;not a hiding-place for a cat.</p>

<p>How, then, had the murderer entered and left the room?</p>

<p>Suicide, of course, was out of the question, owing to the
nature of the wound&mdash;but murder seemed equally out of the
question; Mr. Orford sat so close to the wall that the handle of
the knife touched the panel behind him. For anyone to have stood
between him and the wall would have been impossible; behind the
back of his chair was not space enough to push a
walking-stick.</p>

<p>How, then, had the blow been delivered with such deadly
precision and force?</p>

<p>Not by anyone standing in front of Mr. Orford, first because
he must have seen him and sprung up; and secondly, because, even
had he been asleep with his head down, no one, not even a very
tall man, could have leaned over the top of the desk and driven
in the knife, for experiment was made, and it was found that no
arm could possibly reach such a distance.</p>

<p>The only theory that remained was that Mr. Orford had been
murdered in some other part of the room and afterwards dragged to
his present position.</p>

<p>But this seemed more than unlikely, as it would have meant
moving the desk, a heavy piece of furniture that did not look as
if it had been touched, and also because there was a paper under
the dead man's hand, a pen in his fingers, a splutter of ink
where it had fallen, and a sentence unfinished. The thing
remained a complete and horrid mystery, one that seized the
imagination of men; the thing was the talk of all the
coffee-houses and clubs.</p>

<p>The murder seemed absolutely motiveless, the dead man was not
known to have an enemy in the world, yet robbery was out of the
question, for nothing had been even touched.</p>

<p>The early tragedy was opened out. Mrs. Boyd told all she knew,
which was just what she had told Elisa Minden&mdash;the affair
was twenty years ago, and the gallows bird had no kith or kin
left.</p>

<p>Elisa Minden fell into a desperate state of agitation, a swift
change from her first stricken calm; she wanted Mr. Orford's
house pulled down&mdash;the library and all its contents burnt;
her own wedding-dress did she burn, in frenzied silence, and none
dare stop her; she resisted her father's entreaties that she
should go away directly after the inquest; she would stay on the
spot, she said, until the mystery was solved.</p>

<p>Nothing would content her but a visit to Mr. Orford's cabinet;
she was resolved, she said wildly, to come to the bottom of this
mystery and in that room, which she had entered once and which
had affected her so terribly, she believed she might find some
clue.</p>

<p>The doctor thought it best to allow her to go; he and her
cousin escorted her to the house that now no one passed without a
shudder and into the chamber that all dreaded to enter.</p>

<p>Good Mrs. Boyd was sobbing behind them; the poor soul was
quite mazed with this sudden and ghastly ending to her orderly
life; she spoke all incoherently, explaining, excusing, and
lamenting in a breath; yet through all her trouble she showed
plainly and artlessly that she had had no affection for her
master, and that it was custom and habit that had been wounded,
not love.</p>

<p>Indeed, it seemed that there was no one who did love Humphrey
Orford; the lawyers were already busy looking for a next-of-kin;
it seemed likely that this property and the estates in Suffolk
would go into Chancery.</p>

<p>"You should not go in, my dear, you should not go in," sobbed
the old woman, catching at Miss Minden's black gown (she was in
mourning for the murdered man) and yet peering with a fearful
curiosity into the cabinet.</p>

<p>Elisa looked ill and distraught but also resolute.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mrs. Boyd," said she, pausing on the threshold,
"what became of the scoured silk?"</p>

<p>The startled housekeeper protested that she had never seen it
again; and here was another touch of mystery&mdash;the old
peach-colored silk skirt that four persons had observed in Mr.
Orford's cabinet the night of his murder, had completely
disappeared.</p>

<p>"He must have burnt it," said Captain Hoare, and though it
seemed unlikely that he could have consumed so many yards of
stuff without leaving traces in the grate, still it was the only
possible solution.</p>

<p>"I cannot think why he kept it so long," murmured Mrs. Boyd,
"for it could have been no other than Mrs. Orford's best
gown."</p>

<p>"A ghastly relic," remarked the young soldier grimly.</p>

<p>Elisa Minden went into the middle of the room and stared about
her; nothing in the place was changed, nothing disordered; the
desk had been moved round to allow of the scholar being carried
away, his chair stood back, so that the long panel on which hung
the picture of the gallows, was fuller exposed to view.</p>

<p>To Elisa's agitated imagination this portion of the wall sunk
in the surrounding bookshelves, long and narrow, looked like the
lid of a coffin.</p>

<p>"It is time that picture came down," she said; "it cannot
interest anyone any longer."</p>

<p>"Lizzie, dear," suggested her father gently, "had you not
better come away?&mdash;this is a sad and awful place."</p>

<p>"No," replied she. "I must find out about it&mdash;we must
know."</p>

<p>And she turned about and stared at the portrait of Flora
Orford.</p>

<p>"He hated her, Mrs. Boyd, did he not? And she must have died
of fear&mdash;think of that!&mdash;died of fear, thinking all the
while of that poor body on the gallows. He was a wicked man and
whoever killed him must have done it to revenge Flora
Orford."</p>

<p>"My dear," said the doctor hastily, "all that was twenty years
ago, and the man was quite justified in what he did, though I
cannot say I should have been so pleased with the match if I had
known this story."</p>

<p>"How did we ever like him?" muttered Elisa Minden. "If I had
entered this room before I should never have been promised to
him&mdash;there is something terrible in it."</p>

<p>"And what else can you look for, my dear," snivelled Mrs.
Boyd, "in a room where a man has been murdered."</p>

<p>"But it was like this before," replied Miss Minden; "it
<i>frightened</i> me."</p>

<p>She looked round at her father and cousin, and her face quite
distorted.</p>

<p>"There is something here now," she said, "something in this
room."</p>

<p>They hastened towards her, thinking that her over-strained
nerves had given way; but she took a step forward.</p>

<p>Shriek after shriek left her lips.</p>

<p>With a quivering finger she pointed before her at the long
panel behind the desk.</p>

<p>At first they could not tell at what she pointed; then Captain
Hoare saw the cause of her desperate terror.</p>

<p>It was a small portion of faded, peach-colored silk showing
above the ribbed line of the wainscot, protruding from the wall,
like a garment of stuff shut in a door.</p>

<p>"She is in there!" cried Miss Minden. "In there!"</p>

<p>A certain frenzy fell on all of them; they were in a
confusion, hardly knowing what they said or did. Only Captain
Hoare kept some presence of mind and, going up to the panel,
discerned a fine crack all round.</p>

<p>"I believe it is a door," he said, "and that explains how the
murderer must have struck&mdash;from the wall."</p>

<p>He lifted the picture of the hanged man and found a small knob
or button, which, as he expected, on being pressed sent the panel
back into the wall, disclosing a secret chamber no larger than a
cupboard.</p>

<p>And directly inside this hidden room that was dark to the
sight and noisome to the nostrils, was the body of a woman,
leaning against the inner wall with a white kerchief knotted
tightly round her throat, showing how she had died; she wore the
scoured silk skirt, the end of which had been shut in the panel,
and an old ragged bodice of linen that was like a dirty
parchment; her hair was grey and scanty, her face past any
likeness to humanity, her body thin and dry.</p>

<p>The room, which was lit only by a window a few inches square
looking onto the garden, was furnished with a filthy bed of rags
and a stool with a few tattered clothes; a basket of broken bits
was on the floor.</p>

<p>Elisa Minden crept closer.</p>

<p>"It is Flora Orford," she said, speaking like one in a
dream.</p>

<p>They brought the poor body down into the room, and then it was
clear that this faded and terrible creature had a likeness to the
pictured girl who smiled from the canvas over the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>And another thing was clear and, for a moment, they did not
dare speak to each other.</p>

<p>For twenty years this woman had endured her punishment in the
wall chamber in that library that no one but her husband entered;
for twenty years he had kept her there, behind the picture of her
lover, feeding her on scraps, letting her out only when the
household was abed, amusing himself with her torture&mdash;she
mending the scoured silk she had worn for twenty years, sitting
there, cramped in the almost complete dark, a few feet from where
he wrote his elegant poetry.</p>

<p>"Of course she was crazy," said Captain Hoare at length, "but
why did she never cry out?"</p>

<p>"For a good reason," whispered Dr. Minden, when he had signed
to Mrs. Boyd to take his fainting daughter away. "He saw to
that&mdash;<i>she has got no tongue</i>."</p>

<p>The coffin bearing the nameplate <i>"Flora Orford"</i> was
exhumed, and found to contain only lead; it was substituted by
another containing the wasted body of a woman who died by her own
hand twenty years after the date on the mural tablet to her
memory.</p>

<p>Why or how this creature, certainly become idiotic and
dominated entirely by the man who kept her prisoner, had suddenly
found the resolution and skill to slay her tyrant and afterwards
take her own life (a thing she might have done any time before)
was a question never solved.</p>

<p>It was supposed that he had formed the hideous scheme to
complete his revenge by leaving her in the wall to die of
starvation while he left with his new bride for abroad, and that
she knew this and had forestalled him; or else that her poor,
lunatic brain had been roused by the sound of a woman's voice as
she handled the scoured silk which the captive was allowed to
creep out and mend when the library door was locked. But over
these matters and the details of her twenty years' suffering, it
is but decent to be silent.</p>

<p>Lizzie Minden married her cousin, but not at St. Paul's,
Covent Garden. Nor did they ever return to the neighborhood of
Humphrey Orford's house.</p>

THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURE<br>
OF MR. JOHN PROUDIE</h2>

<h3>Also published in <i>The Bishop of Hell and Other Stories</i>, Valancourt Books, 1949</h3>

<p class="first">MR. JOHN PROUDIE kept a chemist's shop in Soho
Fields, Monmouth Square; it was a very famous shop, situated at
the corner, so that there were two fine windows of leaded glass,
one looking on Dean Street and one on the Square, and at the
corner the door, with a wooden portico by which two steps
descended into the shop.</p>

<p>A wooden counter, polished and old, ran round this shop, and
was bare of everything save a pair of gleaming brass scales;
behind, the walls were covered from floor to ceiling by shelves
which held jars of Delft pottery, blue and white, and Italian
majolica, red and yellow, on which were painted the names of the
various drugs; in the centre the shelves were broken by a door
that led into an inner room.</p>

<p>On a certain night in November when the shop was shut, the old
housekeeper abed, and the fire burning brightly in the parlour,
Mr John Proudie was busy in his little laboratory compounding
some medicines, in particular a mixture of the milky juice of
blue flag root and pepper which he had found very popular for
indigestion.</p>

<p>He was beginning to feel cold, and, not being a young man (at
this time, the year 1690, Mr Proudie was nearly sixty), a little
tired, and to think with pleasure of his easy chair, his hot
drink of mulled wine on the hearth, his <i>Gazette</i> with its
exciting news of the war and the Commons and the plots, when a
loud peal at the bell caused him to drop the strainer he was
holding&mdash;not that it was so unusual for Mr Proudie's bell to
ring after dark, but his thoughts had been full of these same
troubles of plots and counter-plots of the late Revolution, and
the house seemed very lonely and quiet.</p>

<p>'Fine times,' thought Mr Proudie indignantly, 'when an honest
tradesman feels uneasy in his own home!'</p>

<p>The bell went again, impatiently, and the apothecary wiped his
hands, took up a candle, and went through to the dark shop. As he
passed through the parlour he glanced up at the clock and was
surprised to see that it was nearly midnight. He set the candle
in its great pewter stick on the counter, whence the light threw
glistening reflections on the rows of jars and their riches, and
opened the door. A gust of wind blew thin cold sleet across the,
polished floor, and the apothecary shivered as he cried out: 'Who
is there?'</p>

<p>Without replying a tall gentleman stepped down into the shop,
closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>'Well, sir?' asked Mr Proudie a little sharply.</p>

<p>'I want a doctor,' said the stranger, 'at once.'</p>

<p>He glanced round the shop impatiently, taking no more notice
of Mr Proudie than if he had been a servant.</p>

<p>'And why did you come here for a doctor?' demanded the
apothecary, not liking his manner and hurt at the insinuation
that his own professional services were not good enough.</p>

<p>'I was told,' replied the stranger, speaking in tolerable
English, but with a marked foreign accent, 'that a doctor lodged
over your shop.'</p>

<p>'So he does,' admitted Mr Proudie grudgingly; 'but he is
abed.'</p>

<p>The stranger approached the counter and leant against it in
the attitude of a man exhausted; the candlelight was now full on
him, but revealed nothing of his features, for he wore a black
mask such as was used for travelling on doubtful rendezvous; a
black lace fringe concealed the lower part of his face.</p>

<p>Mr Proudie did not like this; he scented mystery and underhand
intrigue, and he stared at the stranger very doubtfully.</p>

<p>He was a tall, graceful man, certainly young, wrapped in a
dark blue mantle lined with fur and wearing riding gloves and top
boots; the skirts of a blue velvet coat showed where the mantle
was drawn up by his sword, and there was a great deal of fine
lace and a diamond brooch at his throat.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said impatiently, and his black eyes flashed
through the mask holes, 'how long are you going to keep me
waiting? I want Dr Valletort at once.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you know his name?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I was told his name. Now, for God's sake, sir, fetch
him&mdash;tell him it is a woman who requires his services!'</p>

<p>Mr Proudie turned reluctantly away and picked up the candle,
leaving the gentleman in the dark, mounted the stairs to the two
rooms above the shop, and roused his lodger.</p>

<p>'You are wanted, Dr Valletort,' he said through the door;
'there is a man downstairs come to fetch you to a lady&mdash;a
bitter night and he a foreign creature in a mask,' finished the
old apothecary in a grumble.</p>

<p>Dr Francis Valletort at once opened the door; he was not in
bed, but had been reading by the light of a small lamp. Tall and
elegant, with the pallor of a scholar and the grace of a
gentleman, the young doctor stood as if startled, holding his
open book in his hand.</p>

<p>'Do not go,' said Mr Proudie on a sudden impulse; 'these are
troubled times and it is a bitter night to be abroad.'</p>

<p>The doctor smiled.</p>

<p>'I cannot afford to decline patients, Mr
Proudie&mdash;remember how much I am in your debt for food and
lodging,' he added with some bitterness.</p>

<p>'Tut, tut!' replied Mr Proudie, who had a real affection for
the young man. 'But no doubt I am an old fool&mdash;come down and
see this fellow.'</p>

<p>The doctor took up his shabby hat and cloak and followed the
apothecary down into the parlour and from there into the
shop.</p>

<p>'I hope you are ready,' said the voice of the stranger from
the dark; 'the patient may be dead through this delay.'</p>

<p>Mr Proudie again placed the candle on the counter; the red
flame of it illuminated the tall, dark figure of the stranger and
the shabby figure of the doctor against the background of the
dark shop and the jars&mdash;labelled 'Gum Camphor', 'Mandrake
Root', 'Dogwood Bark', 'Blue Vervain', 'Tansy', 'Hemlock', and
many other drugs, written in blue and red lettering under the
glazing.</p>

<p>'Where am I to go and what is the case?' asked Francis
Valletort, eyeing the stranger intently.</p>

<p>'Sir, I will tell you all these questions on the way; the
matter is urgent.'</p>

<p>'What must I take with me?'</p>

<p>The stranger hesitated.</p>

<p>'First, Dr Valletort,' he said, 'are you skilled in the
Italian?'</p>

<p>The young doctor looked at the stranger very steadily. 'I
studied medicine at the University of Padua,' he replied.</p>

<p>'Ah! Well, then, you will be able to talk to the patient, an
Italian lady who speaks no English. Bring your instruments and
some antidotes for poisoning, and make haste.'</p>

<p>The doctor caught the apothecary by the arm and drew him into
the parlour. He appeared in considerable agitation.</p>

<p>'Get me my sword and pistols,' he said swiftly, 'while I
prepare my case.'</p>

<p>He spoke in a whisper, for the door was open behind them into
the shop, and the apothecary, alarmed by his pale look, answered
in the same fashion: 'Why are you going? Do you know this
man?'</p>

<p>'I cannot tell if I know him or not&mdash;what shall I do? God
help me!'</p>

<p>He spoke in such a tone of despair and looked so white and ill
that Mr Proudie pushed him into a chair by the fire and bade him
drink some of the wine that was warming.</p>

<p>'You will not go out tonight,' he said firmly.</p>

<p>'No,' replied the doctor, wiping the damp from his brow, 'I
cannot go.'</p>

<p>John Proudie returned to the shop to take this message to the
stranger, who, on hearing it, broke into a passionate ejaculation
in a foreign language, then thrust his hand into his coat
pocket.</p>

<p>'Take this to Francis Valletort,' he answered, 'and then see
if he will come.'</p>

<p>He flung on the counter, between the scales and candle, a ring
of white enamel, curiously set with alternate pearls and diamonds
very close together, and having suspended from it a fine chain
from which hung a large and pure pearl.</p>

<p>Before the apothecary could reply Francis Valletort, who had
heard the stranger's words, came from the parlour and snatched at
the ring. While he was holding it under the candle flame and
gazing at the whiteness of diamond, pearl, and enamel, the masked
man repeated his words.</p>

<p>'Now will you come?'</p>

<p>The doctor straightened his thin shoulders, his hollow face
was flushed into a strange beauty.</p>

<p>'I will come,' he said; he pushed back the brown locks that
had slipped from the black ribbon on to his cheek and turned to
pick up his hat and cloak, while he asked Mr Proudie to go up to
his room and fetch his case of instruments.</p>

<p>The apothecary obeyed; there was something in the manner of
Francis Valletort that told him that he was now as resolute in
undertaking this errand as hitherto he had been anxious to avoid
it; but he did not care for the adventure. When the stranger had
thrust his hand into his pocket to find the ring that had
produced such an effect on the doctor, Mr Proudie had noticed
something that he considered very unpleasant. The soft doeskin
glove had fallen back, caught in the folds of the heavy mantle as
the hand was withdrawn, and Mr Proudie had observed a black wrist
through the lace ruffles: the masked cavalier was a negro. Mr
Proudie had seen few coloured men and regarded them with
suspicion and aversion; and what seemed to him so strange was
that what he styled a 'blackamoor' should be thus habited in
fashionable vestures and speaking with an air of authority.</p>

<p>However, evidently Francis Valletort knew the man or at least
his errand&mdash;doubtless from some days of student adventure in
Italy; and the apothecary did not feel called upon to interfere.
He returned with the case of instruments to find the stranger and
the doctor both gone, the parlour and the shop both empty, and
the candle on the counter guttering furiously in the fierce
draught from the half-open door.</p>

<p>Mr Proudie was angry; there had been no need to slip away like
that, sending him away by a trick, and still further no need to
leave the door open at the mercy of any passing vagabond.</p>

<p>The apothecary went and peered up and down the street; all was
wet darkness; a north wind flung the stinging rain in his face; a
distant street lamp cast a fluttering flame but no light on the
blackness.</p>

<p>Mr Proudie closed the door with a shudder and went back to his
fire and his <i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>'Let him,' he said to himself, still vexed, 'go on his fool's
errand.'</p>

<p>He knew very little of Francis Valletort, whose acquaintance
he had made a year ago when the young doctor had come to him to
buy drugs. The apothecary had found his customer earnest,
intelligent, and learned, and a friendship had sprung up between
the two men which had ended in the doctor renting the two rooms
above the shop, and, under the wing of the apothecary, picking up
what he could of the crumbs let fall by the fashionable
physicians of this fashionable neighbourhood.</p>

<p>'I hope he will get his fee tonight,' thought Mr Proudie, as
he stirred the fire into a blaze; then, to satisfy his curiosity
as to whether this were really a medical case or only an excuse,
he went to the dispensary to see if the doctor had taken any
drugs. He soon discovered that two bottles, one containing an
antidote against arsenic poisoning, composed of oxide of iron and
flax seed, the other a mixture for use against lead poisoning,
containing oak bark and green tea, were missing.</p>

<p>'So there <i>was</i> someone ill?' cried Mr Proudie aloud,
and at that moment the door bell rang again.</p>

<p>'He is soon back,' thought the apothecary, and hastened to
undo the door; 'perhaps he was really hurried away and forgot his
case.' He opened the door with some curiosity, being eager to
question the doctor, but it was another stranger who stumbled
down the two steps into the dark shop&mdash;a woman, whose head
was wrapped in a cloudy black shawl.</p>

<p>The wind had blown out the candle on the counter and the shop
was only lit by the illumination, faint and dull, from the
parlour; therefore, Mr Proudie could not see his second visitor
clearly, but only sufficiently to observe that she was richly
dressed and young; the door blew open, and wind and rain were
over both of them; Mr Proudie had to clap his hand to his wig to
keep it on his head.</p>

<p>'Heaven help us!' he exclaimed querulously. 'What do you want,
madam?'</p>

<p>For answer she clasped his free hand with fingers so chill
that they struck a shudder to the apothecary's heart, and broke
out into a torrent of words in what was to Mr Proudie an
incomprehensible language; she was obviously in the wildest
distress and grief, and perceiving that the apothecary did not
understand her, she flung herself on her knees, wringing her
hands and uttering exclamations of despair.</p>

<p>The disturbed Mr Proudie closed the door and drew the lady
into the parlour; she continued to speak, rapidly and with many
gestures, but all he could distinguish was the name of Francis
Valletort.</p>

<p>She was a pretty creature, fair and slight, with braids of
seed pearls in her blonde hair showing through the dark net of
her lace shawl, an apple-green silk gown embroidered with
multitudes of tiny roses, and over all a black Venetian velvet
mantle; long corals were in her ears, and a chain of amber round
her throat; her piteously gesticulating hands were weighted with
large and strange rings.</p>

<p>'If you cannot speak English, madam,' said Mr Proudie, who was
sorry for her distress, but disliked her for her outlandish
appearance and because he associated her with the blackamoor, 'I
am afraid I cannot help you.'</p>

<p>While he spoke she searched his face with eager haggard brown
eyes, and when he finished she sadly shook her head to show that
she did not understand. She glanced round the homely room
impatiently, then, with a little cry of despair and almost
stumbling in her long silken skirts, which she was too absorbed
in her secret passion to gather up, she turned back into the
shop, making a gesture that Mr Proudie took to mean she wished to
leave. The apothecary was not ill-pleased at this; since they
could not understand each other her presence was but an
embarrassment. He would have liked to have asked her to wait the
doctor's return, but saw that she understood no word of English;
he thought it was Italian she spoke, but he could not be even
sure of that.</p>

<p>As swiftly as she had come she had gone, unbolting the door
herself and disappearing into the dark; as far as Mr Proudie
could see, she had neither chair nor coach; in which case she
must have come from nearby, for there was but little wet on her
clothes.</p>

<p>Once more the apothecary returned to his fire, noticing the
faint perfume of iris the lady had left on the air to mingle with
the odours of Peruvian bark and camomile, rosemary and saffron,
beeswax and turpentine, myrrh and cinnamon that rendered heavy
the air of the chemist's shop.</p>

<p>'Well, she knows her own business, I have no doubt,' thought
Mr Proudie, 'and as I cannot help her I had better stay quietly
here till Francis Valletort returns and elucidates the
mystery.'</p>

<p>But he found that he could not fix his thoughts on the
<i>Gazette</i>, nor, indeed, on anything whatever but the
mysterious events of the evening.</p>

<p>He took up an old book of medicine and passed over the pages,
trying to interest himself in old prescriptions of blood root,
mandrake and valerian, gentian, flax seed and hyssop, alum, poke
root and black cherry, which he knew by heart, and which did not
now distract him at all from the thought of the woman in her rich
foreign finery, her distress and distraction, who had come so
swiftly out of the night.</p>

<p>Now she had gone, uneasiness assailed him&mdash;where had she
disappeared? Was she safe? Ought he not forcibly to have kept her
till the return of Francis Valletort, who spoke both French and
Italian? Certainly he had been the cause of the lady's visit; she
had said, again and again, 'Valletort&mdash;Francis Valletort.'
The apothecary drank his spiced wine, trimmed and snuffed his
candles, warmed his feet on the hearth and his hands over the
blaze, and listened for the bell that should tell of the doctor's
return.</p>

<p>He began to get sleepy, almost dozed off in his chair, and was
becoming angry with these adventures that kept him out of his bed
when the bell rang a third time, and he sat up with that start
that a bell rung suddenly in the silence of the night never fails
to give.</p>

<p>'Of course it will be Francis Valletort back again,' he said,
rising and taking up the candle that had now nearly burnt down to
the socket; it was half an hour since the doctor had left the
house.</p>

<p>Once again the apothecary opened the door on to the wet, windy
night; the candle was blown out in his hand.</p>

<p>'You&mdash;must come,' said a woman's voice out of the
darkness; he could just distinguish the figure of his former
visitor, standing in the doorway and looking down on him; she
spoke the three English words with care and difficulty, and with
such a foreign accent that the apothecary stared stupidly, not
understanding, at which she broke out into her foreign
ejaculations, caught at his coat, and dragged at him
passionately.</p>

<p>Mr Proudie, quite bewildered, stepped into the street, and
stood there hatless and cloakless, the candlestick in his
hand.</p>

<p>'If you could only explain yourself, madam!' he exclaimed in
despair.</p>

<p>While he was protesting she drew the door to behind him and,
seizing his arm, hurried along down Dean Street.</p>

<p>Mr Proudie did not wish to refuse to accompany her, but the
adventure was not pleasing to him; he shivered in the night air
and felt apprehensive of the darkness; he wished he had had time
to bring his hat and cloak.</p>

<p>'Madam,' he said, as he hurried along, 'unless you have
someone who can speak English, I fear I shall be no good at all,
whatever your plight.'</p>

<p>She made no answer; he could hear her teeth chattering and
feel her shivering; now and then she stumbled over the rough
stones of the roadway. They had not gone far up the street when
she stopped at the door of one of the mansions and pushed it
gently open, guiding Mr Proudie into a hall in absolute silence
and darkness. Mr Proudie thought that he knew all the houses in
Dean Street, but he could not place this; the darkness had
completely confused him.</p>

<p>The lady opened another door and pushed Mr Proudie into a
chamber where a faint light burned.</p>

<p>The room was unfurnished, covered with dust and in disrepair;
only in front of the shuttered windows hung long, dark blue silk
curtains. Against the wall was hung a silver lamp of beautiful
workmanship, which gave a gloomy glow over the desolate
chamber.</p>

<p>The apothecary was about to speak when the lady, who had been
standing in an attitude of listening, suddenly put her hand over
his mouth and pushed him desperately behind the curtains. Mr
Proudie would have protested, not liking this false position, but
there was no mistaking the terrified entreaty in the foreign
woman's blanched face, and the apothecary, altogether unnerved,
suffered himself to be concealed behind the flowing folds of the
voluminous curtains that showed so strangely in the unfurnished
room.</p>

<p>A firm step sounded outside and Mr Proudie, venturing in the
shadow to peer from behind the curtain, saw his first visitor of
the evening enter the room. He was now without mask, hat, or wig,
and his appearance caused Mr Proudie an inward shudder.</p>

<p>Tall and superb in carriage, graceful, and richly dressed, the
face and head were those of a full-blooded negro; his rolling
eyes, his twitching lips, and an extraordinary pallor that
rendered greenish his dusky skin showed him to be in some fierce
passion. His powerful black hands grasped a martingale of elegant
leather, ornamented with silver studs.</p>

<p>With a fierce gesture he pointed to the lady's draggled skirts
and wet shawl, and in the foreign language that she had used
questioned her with a flood of invective&mdash;or such it seemed
to the terrified ears of Mr Proudie.</p>

<p>She seemed to plead, weep, lament, and defy all at once,
sweeping up and down the room and wringing her hands, and now and
then, it seemed, calling on God and his saints to help her, for
she cast up her eyes and pressed her palms together. To the
amazed apothecary, to whom nothing exciting had ever happened
before, this was like a scene in a stage play; the two brilliant,
fantastic figures, the negro and the fair woman, going through
this scene of incomprehensible passion in the empty room, lit
only by the solitary lamp.</p>

<p>Mr Proudie hoped that there might be no violence in which he
would be called upon to interfere on behalf of the lady: neither
his age nor his strength would give him any chance with the
terrible blackamoor&mdash;he was, moreover, totally unarmed.</p>

<p>His anxieties on this score were ended; the drama being
enacted before his horrified yet fascinated gaze was suddenly cut
short. The negro seized the lady by the wrist and dragged her
from the room.</p>

<p>Complete silence fell; the shivering apothecary was staining
his ears for some sound, perhaps some call for help, some shriek
or cry.</p>

<p>But nothing broke the stillness of the mansion, and presently
Mr Proudie ventured forth from his hiding-place.</p>

<p>He left the room and proceeded cautiously to the foot of the
stairs. Such utter silence prevailed that he began to think he
was alone in the house and that anyhow he might now
return&mdash;the front door was ajar, as his conductress had left
it; the way of escape was easy.</p>

<p>To the end of his days Mr Proudie regretted that he had not
taken it; he never could tell what motives induced him to return
to the room, take down the lamp, and begin exploring the house.
He rather thought, he would say afterwards, that he wanted to
find Francis Valletort; he felt sure that he must be in the house
somewhere and he had a horrid premonition of foul play; he was
sure, in some way, that the house was empty and the lady and the
blackamoor had fled, and an intense curiosity got the better of
his fear, his bewilderment, and his fatigue.</p>

<p>He walked very softly, for he was startled by the creaking of
the boards beneath his feet; the lamp shook in his hand so that
the fitful light ran wavering over walls and ceiling; every
moment he paused and listened, fearful to hear the voice or step
of the blackamoor.</p>

<p>On the first floor all the doors were open, the rooms all
empty, shuttered, desolate, covered with dust and damp.</p>

<p>'There is certainly no-one in the house,' thought Mr Proudie,
with a certain measure of comfort. 'Perhaps Valletort has gone
home while I have been here on this fool's errand.'</p>

<p>He remembered with satisfaction his fire and his bed, the
safe, comfortable shop with the rows of jars, the shining
counter, and the gleaming scales, and the snug little parlour
beyond, with everything to his hand, just as he liked to find it.
Yet he went on up the stairs, continuing to explore the desolate,
empty house, the chill atmosphere of which caused him to shiver
as if he was cold to the marrow.</p>

<p>On the next landing he was brought up short by a gleam of
light from one of the back rooms. In a panic of terror he put out
his own lamp and stood silent and motionless, staring at the
long, faint ray of yellow that fell through the door that was
ajar.</p>

<p>'There is someone in the house, then,' thought Mr Proudie. 'I
wonder if it is the doctor.'</p>

<p>He crept close to the door, but dared not look in; yet could
not go away. The silence was complete; he could only hear the
thump of his own heart.</p>

<p>Curiosity, a horrible, fated curiosity, urged him nearer,
drove him to put his eye to the crack. His gaze fell on a man
leaning against the wall; he was dressed in a rich travelling
dress and wore neither peruke nor hat; his superb head was bare
to the throat, and he was so dark as to appear almost of African
blood; his features, however, were handsome and regular, though
pallid and distorted by an expression of despair and
ferocity.</p>

<p>A candle stuck into the neck of an empty bottle stood on the
bare floor beside him and illuminated his sombre and magnificent
figure, casting a grotesque shadow on the dark, panelled
wall.</p>

<p>At his feet lay a heap of white linen and saffron-coloured
brocade, with here and there the gleam of a red jewel. Mr Proudie
stared at this; as his sight became accustomed to the waving
lights and shades, he saw that he was gazing at a woman.</p>

<p>A dead woman.</p>

<p>She lay all dishevelled, her clothes torn and her black hair
fallen in a tangle&mdash;the man had his foot on the end of it;
her head was twisted to one side and there were dreadful marks on
her throat.</p>

<p>Mr John Proudie gave one sob and fled, with the swiftness and
silence of utter terror, down the stairs, out into the street,
and never ceased running until he reached home.</p>

<p>He had his key in his pocket, and let himself into his house,
panting and sighing, utterly spent. He lit every light in the
place and sat down over the dying fire, his teeth chattering and
his knees knocking together. Like a man bewitched he sat staring
into the fire, raking the embers together, rubbing his hands and
shivering, with his mind a blank for everything but that picture
he had seen through the crack of the door in the empty house in
Dean Street.</p>

<p>When his lamp and candles burnt out he drew the curtains and
let in the colourless light of the November dawn; he began to
move about the shop in a dazed, aimless way, staring at his jars
and scales and pestle and mortar as if they were strange things
he had never seen before.</p>

<p>Now came a young apprentice with a muffler round his neck,
whistling and red with the cold; and as he took down the shutters
and opened the dispensary, as the housekeeper came down and
bustled about the breakfast and there was a pleasant smell of
coffee and bacon in the place, Mr Proudie began to feel that the
happenings of last night were a nightmare indeed that had no
place in reality; he felt a cowardly and strong desire to say
nothing about any of it, but to try to forget the blackamoor, the
foreign lady, and that horrible scene in the upper chamber as
figments of his imagination.</p>

<p>It was, however, useless for him to take cover in the refuge
of silence&mdash;old Emily's first remark went to the root of the
matter. 'Why, where is the doctor? He has never been out so late
before.'</p>

<p>Where, indeed, was Francis Valletort?</p>

<p>With a groan Mr Proudie dragged himself together; his body was
stiff with fatigue, his mind amazed, and he wished that he could
have got into bed and slept off all memories of the previous
night.</p>

<p>Bur he knew the thing must be faced and, snatching up his hat
and coat, staggered out into the air, looking by ten years an
older man than the comfortable, quiet tradesman of last
night.</p>

<p>He went to the nearest magistrate and told his story; he could
see that he was scarcely believed, but a couple of watchmen were
sent with him to investigate the scene of last night's adventure,
which, remarked the magistrate, should be easily found, since
there was, it seemed, but one empty house in Dean Street.</p>

<p>The house was reached, the lock forced, and the place
searched, room by room.</p>

<p>To Mr Proudie's intense disappointment and amazement
absolutely nothing was found: the blue silk curtains had gone, as
had the silver lamp the apothecary had dropped on the stairs in
his headlong flight; in the upper chamber where he had stared
through the crack of the door nothing was to be found&mdash;not a
stain on the boards, not a mark on the wall. Dusty, neglected,
desolate, the place seemed as if it had not been entered for
years.</p>

<p>Mr Proudie began to think that he had been the victim of a
company of ghosts or truly bewitched. Then, inside the door, was
found the pewter candlestick he had held mechanically in his hand
when hurried from his shop and as mechanically let fall here as
he had afterwards let fall the lamp.</p>

<p>This proved nothing beyond the fact that he had been in the
house last night; but it a little reassured him that he was not
altogether losing his wits.</p>

<p>The fullest inquiries were made in the neighbourhood, but
without result. No-one had seen the foreigners, no-one had heard
any noise in the house, and it would have been generally believed
that Mr Proudie had really lost his senses but for one
fact&mdash;<i>Francis Valletort never returned!</i></p>

<p>There was, then, some mystery, but the solving of it seemed
hopeless, No search or inquiries led to the discovery of the
whereabouts of the young doctor, and as he was of very little
importance and had no friends but the old apothecary, his
disappearance was soon forgotten.</p>

<p>But Mr Proudie, who seemed very aged and, the neighbours said,
strange since that November night, was not satisfied with any
such reasoning. Day and night he brooded over the mystery, and
hardly ever out of his mind was the figure of the young scholar
in his shabby clothes, with the strange face of one doomed as he
stood putting his heavy hair back from his face and staring at
the little white ring on the old, polished counter.</p>

<p>As the years went by the rooms over the chemist's shop were
occupied by another lodger and Mr Proudie took possession of the
poor effects of Francis Valletort&mdash;a few shabby clothes, a
few shabby books; nothing of value or even of interest. But to
the apothecary these insignificant articles had an intense if
horrid fascination.</p>

<p>He locked them away in his cabinet and when he was alone he
would take them out and turn them over. In between the thick,
yellow leaves of a Latin book on medicine he found the thin
leaves of what seemed to be the remains of a
diary&mdash;fragments torn violently from the cover&mdash;mostly
half-effaced and one torn across and completely blotted with
ink.</p>

<p>There was no name, but Mr Proudie recognised the handwriting
of Francis Valletort. With pain and difficulty the dim old eyes
of the apothecary made out the following entries:</p>

<br>

<p>'July 15th, 1687&mdash;I saw her in the church
today&mdash;Santa Maria Maggiore. He is her husband, a
Calabrere.' Several lines were blotted out, then came these
words&mdash;'a man of great power; some mystery&mdash;his
half-brother is an African...children of a slave...that such a
woman...</p>

<p>'July 27th&mdash;I cannot see how this is going to end; her
sister is married to the brother&mdash;Vittoria, the
name&mdash;<i>hers</i> Elena della Cxxxxxx.'</p>

<p>'August 3rd&mdash;She showed me the ring today. I think she
has worn it since she was a child; it only fits her little
finger.'</p>

<br>

<p>Again the manuscript was indecipherable; then followed some
words scratched out, but readable&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p>'As if I would not come to her without this token! But she is
afraid of a trick. <i>He</i> is capable of anything&mdash;they, I
mean; the brother is as his shadow. I think she trusts her
sister. My little love!'</p>

<br>

<p>On another page were found further entries:</p>

<br>

<p>'October 10th&mdash;She says that if he discovered us he would
kill her&mdash;us together. He told her he would kill her if she
angered him; showed her a martingale and said they would strangle
her. My God, why do I not murder him? Carlo Fxxxxxx warned me
today.'</p>

<p>'October 29th&mdash;I must leave Padua. For her
sake&mdash;while she is safe&mdash;if she is in trouble she will
send me the ring. I wonder why we go on living&mdash;it is over,
the farewells.'</p>

<br>

<p>Mr Proudie could make out nothing more; he put down the pages
with a shudder. To what dark and secret tale of wrong and passion
did they not refer? Did they not hold the key to the events of
that awful night?</p>

<p>Mr Proudie believed that he had seen the husband and
brother-in-law of some woman Francis Valletort had loved, who had
followed him to England after the lapse of years; having wrung
the secret and the meaning of the white ring from the wretched
wife, the husband had used it to lure the lover to his fate; in
his other visitor the apothecary believed he had seen the sister
Vittoria, who, somehow, had escaped and endeavoured to gain help
from the house where she knew Francis Valletort lived, only to be
silenced again by her husband. And the other woman&mdash;and the
martingale?</p>

<p>'I saw her, too,' muttered Mr Proudie to himself, shivering
over the fire, '<i>but what did they do with Frank?</i>'</p>

<p>He never knew, and died a very old man with all the details of
this mystery unrevealed; the fragments of diary were burnt by
some careless hand for whom they had no interest; the adventure
of Mr Proudie passed into the realms of forgotten mystery, and
there was no-one to tell of them when, a century later, repairs
to the foundations of an old house in Dean Street revealed two
skeletons buried deep beneath the bricks. One was that of a man,
the other that of a woman, round whose bones still hung a few
shreds of saffron-coloured brocade; and between them was a little
ring of white enamel and white stones.</p>

<hr>

<p class="first">ABOUT eleven o'clock at night on the 28th of
August, 1696, the watchman on duty at the corner of Drury Lane
and Queen Street was startled by a woman brushing past him at a
run; he had the impression that she had come from the house just
behind him, a respectable mansion of some importance.</p>

<p>He raised his lantern and turned its beams on the figure
hastening away from him towards Lincoln's Inn Fields; it was a
young gentlewoman decently habited, such a one as he had never
seen alone after dark in this or any other neighbourhood of
London, and he was minded to follow her, but that she appeared in
no way discomposed or agitated; he thought that he had heard her
laugh, as she passed him, in a contented manner.</p>

<p>"Belike she knows her own business best," he said to himself,
thinking of elopements or clandestine meetings in the Fields, and
so returned to his box at the corner.</p>

<p>His laggardly conduct was further induced by the weather,
which was of a wildness seldom known at this time of year;
tearing clouds obscured the moon, now in its first quarter, gusts
of rain shook down the silent street, a wind fit to take a man
off his feet raged from the north; and there was no one abroad;
even the Lane was empty.</p>

<p>The watchman, with his thick cape about him, and withdrawn
into the shelter of his box, could not dismiss from his mind that
slender figure.</p>

<p>He began to recall certain details that had made little
impression at the time; first, she had had no cloak, or mantle,
or hat, or gloves, nothing but a muslin cap tied under the chin,
and a grey gown of some fine stuff, and a little apron of
silvered silk; secondly, she had worn at her heart a great bunch
of heartsease&mdash;purple, yellow, and white.</p>

<p>He turned his lantern on the house which he thought was the
one that the young woman had come from; but now he admitted
himself mistaken, for the house was closed and shuttered; he knew
that it belonged to Mr. James Fortis, Member of Parliament for
Guildford, and that the family had been away some time.</p>

<p>The watchman shivered back into his box, so that he could no
longer see the street, and, being warm and comfortable, presently
dozed a little.</p>

<p>It was but a short while before the violence of the wind
disturbed him and he sat up, almost expecting the box to be blown
about his head.</p>

<p>His lantern gleamed down an empty street; he raised it, and
saw, with an unaccountable start, the figure of a man standing on
the steps of Mr. Fortis' house.</p>

<p>The stranger, who had started violently when the lantern light
fell on his face, recovered himself and spoke.</p>

<p>"It is all right, fellow," he said quietly. "I am Mr. Stephen
Fortis."</p>

<p>He seemed in some considerable perturbation, and stood there
with the wind and rain blowing on him as if uncertain what to do,
which air of agitation and hesitancy was foreign to this
gentleman, who was a well-known lawyer and man of fashion.</p>

<p>"I thought the family was away, your honour," said the
watchman, raising his voice against the storm.</p>

<p>"Everyone <i>is</i> away," replied Mr. Fortis hastily. "I am
up from Guildford on business, and my brother lent me the
house."</p>

<p>"There will be a servant here, then, sir?"</p>

<p>"There is no one."</p>

<p>"I thought I saw a young woman come from your house, sir; not
that she could have been a servant&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Fortis, who was a singularly handsome man, turned a face
of such distress and alarm on the watchman that the latter was
suddenly both suspicious and frightened.</p>

<p>"She did not come from this house," said Mr. Fortis. "I am
alone and I have had no visitors; the creature you speak of was
some lost wretch from the Lane or St. Giles&mdash;there are many
about."</p>

<p>"Not on such a night as this, sir, and without a
cloak&mdash;and this was a gentlewoman&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Fortis interrupted.</p>

<p>"It has nothing to do with me," he said.</p>

<p>The watchman could say no more; before such a man as Mr.
Stephen Fortis he could only bow, and he was lumbering away when
a gust of wind blew aside Mr. Fortis' mantle and showed that he
grasped something in his bare hand, a cluster of purple and
yellow flowers.</p>

<p>"By God, sir," exclaimed the watchman, "that is what she wore
on her heart!"</p>

<p>Mr. Fortis gave a stifled exclamation and then controlled
himself.</p>

<p>"Come into the house," he said.</p>

<p>The man followed him into the hall, and then into the
dining-room, where a couple of candles burnt.</p>

<p>On the table, near the candles, were two little piles of gold,
an ink-horn, a quill, and some paper.</p>

<p>Mr. Fortis flung off his soaked beaver.</p>

<p>"I have good reasons," he said, "for keeping secret my
presence in town. No wrong has been done or is intended. Take a
couple of those gold pieces and hold your tongue."</p>

<p>The watchman saw no objection to this course; the intrigues of
gentlemen were not part of his duty; he was stretching out dirty
fingers for the money when he paused.</p>

<p>"There is blood on your left hand!" he exclaimed. Mr. Fortis
started.</p>

<p>"Throw down those flowers, sir, for God's sake!" cried the
watchman, trembling.</p>

<p>Mr. Fortis obeyed, mechanically it seemed, and cast the
crushed cluster of heartsease beside the gold pieces on the
table.</p>

<p>They were fastened by a length of grey ribbon, dark and stiff
with blood; Mr. Fortis' hand, wrist, ruffle, and shirt were alike
stained.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heavens!" he cried. "What is this?"</p>

<p>"What indeed," exclaimed the watchman, "but evidence of some
damnable crime against that poor creature&mdash;Sir, you must
help me look for the woman who wore that posy."</p>

<p>Mr. Fortis gave him a wild glance, then looked with loathing
at his stained hand; he tore away the lace and flung it down,
then wiped away the blood on palm and finger with an end of his
rain-wet cloak.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of your wayfarer," he said. He spoke rather
wildly, and as if to himself. "Was ever man so persecuted and on
the eve of the elections? My brother must not lose his seat
through this&mdash;" He turned again to the watchman. "Take this
money and begone."</p>

<p>But the fellow shook his head.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that posy, sir?"</p>

<p>"Faugh! A trick&mdash;a silly trick&mdash;it was thrust on me
by a passer by&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then that passer by knows something of that young woman,
sir."</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;but I do not&mdash;you cannot prove that I do or
that she was ever in this house&mdash;why, the whole thing may be
a trick of your imagination&mdash;likely you were half-asleep or
half-drunk&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Fortis now spoke more with the usual assurance of a
gentleman and the customary firmness of a man of law; but as he
finished he fetched a little groan and turned aside as one
pressed beyond bearing.</p>

<p>"It will show ill against you if you will not search with me,
sir," said the watchman with clumsy persistence; he did not like
the looks of the gentleman, and he put the cluster of heartsease
into his greatcoat pocket, and Mr. Fortis, noticing this, started
and muttered "Fool!" against himself for not destroying the
hideous posy.</p>

<p>"Very well, I will come with you," he said desperately, "but
it is near one o'clock now&mdash;where may she not have got in
two hours?"</p>

<p>"Who said it was two hours since I saw her, sir?" demanded the
watchman.</p>

<p>"Was ever a man so tormented?" cried Mr. Fortis
frantically.</p>

<p>The watchman was now convinced that there was some ugly
mystery behind all this, and resolved to gain some credit for
himself in the unravelling of it; the very position and fame of
Mr. Stephen Fortis added zest to the affair.</p>

<p>"'Tis a wild night to go abroad for nothing," remarked the
lawyer, as they closed the front door behind them.</p>

<p>"And you wet through once, sir," replied the watchman; "but
maybe you were not thinking of the weather when you last went
out."</p>

<p>Mr. Fortis cried out passionately at this insolence; but the
fellow answered him&mdash;shouting between the volleys of the
wind:</p>

<p>"Don't try&mdash;and slip away&mdash;Mr. Fortis&mdash;I know
your name&mdash;and your residence."</p>

<p>The gentleman made no answer, and together they battled
through the stormy night until they came to the corner of Wilde
House, and there they paused to get breath under the low
arcade.</p>

<p>"You are sure you would know her again?"</p>

<p>"Quite, sir; she had a very happy face."</p>

<p>"Happy? She looked happy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and she was hastening like one on a cheerful and
important errand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then it was not she!" cried Mr. Fortis.</p>

<p>"Not who, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;" Mr. Fortis checked himself. "If you had seen some
pale, mad woman with melancholy in her countenance I might have
known her&mdash;never mind, let us search for this happy
creature."</p>

<p>The wind had fallen a little, and the moon now setting, sent a
faint, vaporish light through the forlorn waste of clouds.</p>

<p>These singular companions faced the desolation of Lincoln's
Inn Fields and took an aimless road across the darkness.</p>

<p>The yellow splash of lantern light, moving uncertainly over
the rough cobbles was noticed by a man crouching against the
railings of one of the great mansions.</p>

<p>He came running forward.</p>

<p>"Watch, watch!" he cried. "Are you the watch?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fortis stepped back from the light and pulled his hat over
his eyes.</p>

<p>"I am looking for a young woman," said the newcomer, who
appeared to be an artisan of the better sort. "She is lodging
with my wife in Holborn; she went out this evening and never came
home. I thought she might be lost in the Fields, but there is
neither light nor peace abroad to-night, and I can find
nothing."</p>

<p>"We are on the same errand," said the watchman, "we are
looking for a young gentlewoman&mdash;had she a grey dress and
muslin cap?"</p>

<p>"That is she; have you seen her?"</p>

<p>"And had she," continued the watchman, "a bunch of heartsease
at her heart?"</p>

<p>"She had, sir; she had bought them at Covent Garden this
morning."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the watchman, "I have seen her, but that was a
matter of over two hours ago."</p>

<p>The storm was dying away; a gentler wind cleared the loose
clouds from the sky, here and there a star appeared; it no longer
rained.</p>

<p>"Let us continue our search," said Mr. Fortis in a faint
voice. He kept his face hidden.</p>

<p>Together the three traversed the great space of the open
square, past the empty hackney stand, the deserted theatre, in
and out the great trees whose branches still shook and quivered
with the violence of the tempest&mdash;until, on the farther side
of the fields, finally, they found her, washed, by the force of
wind and rain, against two of the posts of the footway, as a
broken branch of flowers might be driven by cruel weather against
the garden wall.</p>

<p>She was as wet as if she had been drowned, her skirts clinging
to her limbs and stuck with mud and small stones, snapped twigs,
and glistening leaves; her cap and hair together made one soaked
twist on the stones beneath her; on her bosom was a red-stained
rag; the same hue was washed over her rain-soaked clothes; her
eyes, blue as summer, gazed up from a wan and childish face that
the rain had washed free from every impurity, and that faced the
inscrutable heavens with an expression of wild question and
smiling agony for ever fixed there by the hand of Death.</p>

<p>The first to move was Mr. Fortis; he turned away with a
terrible shudder and put his hand over his eyes.</p>

<p>The watchman bent over her and raised the scrap of linen that
had been pressed to the welling wound on her heart.</p>

<p>"Just where she wore her posy," he muttered. "Who was she?" he
asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"A young lady from Guildford," answered the man hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the watchman slowly, "Mr. Stephen Fortis
will know her."</p>

<p>"Mr. Stephen Fortis!" cried the other. "Is he here? He is her
murderer&mdash;there is none other on God's earth had cause to
take her life!"</p>

<p>As with one impulse he and the watchman caught at the wretched
gentleman and dragged him near the body that lay in the beams of
the lantern now set on the ground.</p>

<p>He struggled to get at his sword, but they gripped him
firmly.</p>

<p>"As I live," he cried fiercely, in his desperation, "I am
innocent. This will ruin my brother. He has many enemies. And
I&mdash;I am but six weeks off my marriage day."</p>

<p>Before the day dawned the brother of the Member for Guildford
was lodged in prison under a charge of murder.</p>

<p>As soon as the ghastly news had got hot-foot through the town,
before even the brother or friends of the accused man could rally
to his defence, a lady attended only by her maid came to see the
unhappy gentleman in his prison. It was his betrothed, the
daughter of the Earl of Thanet, Lady Sarah Pryde; she had come
without the consent of her parents, nay, against their wishes,
but in the first confusion and horror of the news they had been
powerless to resist her passionate resolve to stand by her
lover.</p>

<p>She was not allowed to see the prisoner nor to send any letter
or message.</p>

<p>White-lipped and dry-eyed she hastened to the mansion of Mr.
James Fortis.</p>

<p>The Member for Guildford had just arrived in London and
received the lady in the parlour, where his brother had spoken
the night before with the watchman.</p>

<p>He was as pallid, as agitated as she, and had not so much
control.</p>

<p>"I am ruined," he burst out, "ruined! Those damned Tories will
make this cost me my seat!"</p>

<p>He saw her desperate look and was instantly remorseful.</p>

<p>"My lady, my lady, you had best keep out of this," he cried.
"It is no story for you."</p>

<p>Slight and fragile-looking in her blue muslin morning gown, a
dark cloak flung about her shoulders, and her black locks falling
in disorder about her agonized face, she fronted James Fortis,
more serene than he in her greater love and greater faith.</p>

<p>"Tell me all you know," she urged. "Who was&mdash;this most
unfortunate gentlewoman?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fortis commanded himself as best he could.</p>

<p>"So far there is no mystery, my lady," he answered. "She was a
Quakeress of Guildford&mdash;a quiet creature of uneventful
life&mdash;about twenty-seven years of age."</p>

<p>"Tell me what else you know&mdash;tell me quickly. Do you not
see that I must know everything&mdash;that I may discover the
truth and save him?"</p>

<p>She spoke with a dignity and power that overawed Mr. Fortis'
shaken soul.</p>

<p>"What do I know?" he answered. "Next to nothing! She was
missed the day before yesterday, did not return from her usual
walk&mdash;they found she had taken the mail coach from Guildford
to London&mdash;the guard remembers her in a grey cardinal. It
was found here last night."</p>

<p>At this Lady Sarah shuddered and took a step back from the
table.</p>

<p>"You must not say that," she exclaimed, "it could not be the
same&mdash;go on," she added, controlling herself. "What did this
poor creature do when she got to London?"</p>

<p>"Hannah Power&mdash;that is her name&mdash;went straight to
the lodgings of a Mrs. Garnet, in High Holborn, the wife of a
saddler, formerly of Guildford; she had stayed there before, with
her mother, when they had come to London to see the celebrations
for the fall of Namur."</p>

<p>"And these people," cried Lady Sarah, quickly, "seeing this
young woman alone and without luggage, did they not communicate
with Guildford?"</p>

<p>"Would to God they had! Instead, they let her mope in her
chamber; she only went out in the morning, when she returned with
a root of heartsease which she had bought at Covent Garden; in
the evening she went out, saying that she had an appointment at
Lincoln's Inn Fields, and that it was a matter of life and
death."</p>

<p>"And they let her go&mdash;alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The next thing is, the uncle appears, having come up
from Guildford after the runaway, who has been traced to London.
They went out to search for her&mdash;it was the saddler, Matthew
Garnet, who met Stephen and the watchman in the Fields&mdash;and
found her."</p>

<p>"Who are these Garnets?" cried Lady Sarah. "They play a
strange part, never telling anyone the girl is with them, letting
her out alone, after noticing she was distraught!"</p>

<p>"I do not trust them," replied Mr. Fortis. "At the last
election this fellow was the agent of Pryor, the Tory who tried
for my seat, an unscrupulous knave, deep in obligation to his
patron, who had saved him from a hanging, to my thinking."</p>

<p>"Why, then," cried the Iady eagerly, "that is something to go
upon."</p>

<p>The Member for Guildford answered almost sharply in his deep
distress:</p>

<p>"I fear it is nothing at all; they can prove the truth of
their tale, and the Pryors have nothing to do with Hannah
Power."</p>

<p>"Do you know the Powers?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nay, by name and repute only; they are not of our station,
and belong to the faction of the Pryors."</p>

<p>"Then Stephen did not know this poor soul?" cried the lady,
with a great hope beaming in her heart.</p>

<p>"He knew her," replied Mr. Fortis reluctantly. "A few years
ago she came into a little property from an aunt; the charge of
this was in Stephen's hands, he had to call at her house to
deliver her her moneys. I never heard that he saw her at any
other time, unless it was by chance in the streets."</p>

<p>"Then why should there be any suspicion whatever on Stephen?"
cried the brave-hearted girl.</p>

<p>"Why?" answered Mr. Fortis in despair. "What of the watchman's
tale&mdash;the bunch of heartsease in his hand, the grey cardinal
found here, and the handkerchief with 'S. F.' on it found on her
bosom?"</p>

<p>Lady Sarah had not heard this detail before; she turned faint
and could no longer stand, but sank into the nearest chair, her
hands clasped tightly in her lap.</p>

<p>Before either could speak the Earl of Thanet was ushered into
their presence.</p>

<p>He had come to claim his daughter&mdash;an angry and an
outraged man.</p>

<p>"Sarah, you must come home with me; matters are beyond your
meddling."</p>

<p>She rose but shook her head.</p>

<p>"You cannot keep me out of this, my lord. I am to be Stephen's
wife."</p>

<p>"That is yet to be seen," answered the wrathful Earl.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Fortis was roused to his brother's defence, and to
championing that honour which was as dear to him as his own.</p>

<p>"My lord, my lord!" he cried. "Beware how you are harsh or
unjust! You, who were willing to give your daughter to my
brother, ought to be the last to credit the foul aspersion cast
on him."</p>

<p>The Earl was something ashamed; he stood fumbling at his sword
hilt and staring at the floor.</p>

<p>"What is your brother's tale?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What should it be but the simple truth?" replied Mr. Fortis,
with an expression of great uneasiness that belied the confidence
of his words. "He denies everything. He had come up to town, as
you know, my lord, on business connected with his
marriage&mdash;and was lodging at the 'Black Bull,' Holborn."</p>

<p>"And what was he doing here last night?" demanded the Earl
sharply.</p>

<p>"He came to get some papers I had asked him to send me to
Guildford&mdash;the money on the table was some loose coin he had
found in my desk; he went out to buy some twine to do up the
parcel."</p>

<p>"At that hour of the night&mdash;in that weather?" asked my
lord sarcastically.</p>

<p>Mr. Fortis, pallid to the lips, stuck doggedly to his
story.</p>

<p>"The hour had escaped him&mdash;his mind was full of many
things."</p>

<p>"And the bunch of flowers?"</p>

<p>"They were thrust into his hand by a poor creature whom he met
in the Fields; he had given her a coin. Till the watchman called
out, he had not noticed what he was carrying."</p>

<p>"Ah! The grey cardinal?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fortis smiled sadly.</p>

<p>"I see, my lord, that you have made yourself master of all
points against my poor brother."</p>

<p>"I have spoken with the lawyer in whose hands the case is, and
gone through all the evidence."</p>

<p>"The grey cardinal," said Mr. Fortis, with a quivering lip,
"is not that worn by Hannah Power; it belongs to my wife."</p>

<p>At this lie Lady Sarah gave a shudder of anguish. The Earl
broke out into bitter anger.</p>

<p>"And is this the best tale you can put up between you? Good
God, if you get a jury of fools there is not one who will believe
you!"</p>

<p>Such was also the private opinion of Mr. Fortis, but he stood
gallantly to his weak defences.</p>

<p>"There has never been a breath against my brother, my Iord,"
he said proudly, "even a hint of scandal&mdash;even in his
college days; he has always been respected and admired. How
should anyone dare to suspect him of this monstrous crime?"</p>

<p>The Earl was not convinced.</p>

<p>"He will find great difficulty in clearing himself," he
remarked dryly. "Why, the truth is clear on the face of it! Had
he not seen her many times in private? Was not she a simple woman
and he a likely man?"</p>

<p>Quivering in every fibre Lady Sarah turned to her father.</p>

<p>"My lord, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Come, my dear," he said very kindly, "you must let me take
you home."</p>

<p>But she turned on him wildly.</p>

<p>"No! I belong to Stephen&mdash;I am going to Stephen&mdash;you
must take me to him. I must speak with him."</p>

<p>In the end her frantic insistence prevailed; the Earl and Mr.
Fortis conducted her to the prison and obtained permission for
her to see Stephen Fortis in private.</p>

<p>Inside the cell where the accused man was confined, the two
young people, each pale and haggard as death, clung desperately
together, each forgetful, in the first few moments, of everything
save the overwhelming emotion of love.</p>

<p>She was the first to regain her self-control; panting, pallid,
and quivering, she lay in his arms (alone she could hardly stand
on her feet), and begged him (for her sake!) to have strength and
courage.</p>

<p>"Tell me the truth," she entreated. "What are you
concealing?"</p>

<p>"Have you not heard what I told James?" he groaned.</p>

<p>"No one believes that, not even my father, Stephen." She drew
away from him, struggling for composure and courage.</p>

<p>"Child, are you so sure the truth will set me free?"</p>

<p>The glory of her great love and loyalty shone in her beautiful
eyes.</p>

<p>"Quite sure," she said.</p>

<p>He covered his face in his hands for a moment, then looked at
her straightly.</p>

<p>"The truth," he answered hoarsely, "would damn me in any eyes
but yours, Sarah. I did meet Hannah Power last night."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"She came to James' house; that was her cardinal they
found."</p>

<p>Lady Sarah went up to him and rested her head, with complete
trust and faith, against his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Tell me all," she whispered.</p>

<p>"I do not know that I have a right, Sarah. And yet I must, and
you will think meanly of me for this telling. God knows I had
never spoken but for this extremity!"</p>

<p>She clasped him closer, and he held to her as he spoke.</p>

<p>"This unhappy gentlewoman loved me," he said faintly. "I think
she was in a melancholy, not in her right mind to so pursue one
who cared not for her. I&mdash;I did what I could. It is a
position above all others intolerable for a man. I avoided her;
she filled me with much compassion and some repulsion. God
forgive me! She tormented me. Every time there was some excuse,
to fetch me into her presence and to argue with me her fond
delusion that we must love each other. I often thought this
passion was a madness, and that she might do some mischief, but I
was the person above all others who could not betray her
state."</p>

<p>"Alas, poor creature!" murmured Lady Sarah.</p>

<p>"I saw her as seldom as I could. I would not have seen her at
all but for fear she would commit some open folly. She used to
write to me when I was in town, letters no woman in her senses
would have written. When she heard of our betrothal she came at
once to town, and wrote to me asking me to see her for the last
time. She said it must be in the evening, near Holborn. I made
the appointment at my brother's house."</p>

<p>She pressed his arm, strengthening him with her courage.</p>

<p>"I decided this must be the end of everything," he resumed. "I
took with me some money due to her and all her papers&mdash;she
came, all distraught; I noticed that she wore a cluster of
pansies&mdash;heartsease, as the old women call them. Once I had
told her that I admired these flowers. She bade me look at them,
telling me that they stood for' penseroso,' or thought. I put her
off this theme, and told her that she must, for her own fair
fame, find another man of business. She became so stormy that I
doubted more than ever if she were in full possession of her
wits, and with all the force I was able to command I bade her
leave this folly that would be her ruin. Then she became so calm
that I had good hopes of her finally seeing reason."</p>

<p>"It was but the calm of despair," murmured Lady Sarah.</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;fool that I was, did not see it. I was
half-distracted myself. She made me one request, asking if I
would step out at midnight as far as Wilde House portico, where a
messenger of hers would meet me and tell me she was safely on her
way home. 'For I know,' she said, 'that you will have no peace of
mind while I am in town, and I intend to take the night mail to
Guildford.' She was so importunate that I agreed to this fantasy
of hers, and she broke from me and rushed out into the rain,
leaving behind her mantle, the money, and papers. At midnight I
went out and waited under the lamp at the corner of the Fields. A
woman wrapped in a heavy shawl accosted me and asked if I were
Mr. Stephen Fortis; as I said 'Yes' she thrust the flowers into
my hand, and disappeared into the dark. I half-saw, half-guessed
that this was the posy lately worn by Hannah Power, and that this
was her manner of saying farewell. As I returned to the house I
met the watchman, whom&mdash;God help me!&mdash;I had forgotten.
The rest you know."</p>

<p>"She slew herself," said Lady Sarah, in a low tone. "And the
Garnets are helping the Powers and the Pryors to fix a crime on
you. But tell me, my dear, my love, your handkerchief was found
on her breast."</p>

<p>He started.</p>

<p>"I did not know that! But she had one of mine I lent her to
tie up a wound on her dog's foot in Guildford once."</p>

<p>"And her letters&mdash;did you keep any of her letters?" asked
Lady Sarah.</p>

<p>"Nay, in compassion, I destroyed them all."</p>

<p>The girl shivered.</p>

<p>"Then there is nothing but your word for this?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," he answered with a sad smile. "And probably
you are the only person who will believe me."</p>

<p>So indeed it proved; the extraordinary tale of Stephen Fortis
was received with general incredulity; the Powers furiously
denied that Hannah was capable of the conduct imputed to her by
the prisoner, and even his friends held that his tale had further
damaged a weak cause.</p>

<p>No influence could stem the tide of popular feeling. The
verdict at the inquest was "Wilful Murder against Stephen
Fortis."</p>

<p>Three days before the date appointed for his execution,
Stephen Fortis asked his betrothed to bring him his little Bible
that he had left with his other effects in his chamber at the
"Black Bull."</p>

<p>These things, after having been searched by the lawyer's
agents, had been delivered to Mr. James Fortis; the Bible was
found in the open portable desk that had been on the table in the
bed-chamber.</p>

<p>The unfortunate lady was clasping it to her bosom with tears
of utter anguish, when a thick letter, twice sealed, fell out on
the floor at her feet.</p>

<p>This, which had never been opened, was addressed to:</p>

<p class="cp">"STEPHEN FORTIS, Esquire,"</p>

<p>at the Black Bull Inn, High Holborn, and had been sent by the
post.</p>

<p>The lady took this to Mr. James Fortis, who went with her to
the Black Bull Inn, and there the waiter was found who remembered
the arrival of the letter on the 29th of August and having taken
it upstairs and put it with the other papers on the gentleman's
little desk; the arrest not then having been heard of,
afterwards, in the excitement, he had forgotten all about it; it
must have got inside the shagreen case which held the Bible, and
been overlooked by the constables in their search.</p>

<p>The letter was opened before a magistrate.</p>

<p>It was from Hannah Power, dated from High Holborn, August
28th.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">My own dear love&mdash;I may call you that
now, and you will not frown, for when you read this I shall not
be able to vex you any more. You have been never kind to
me&mdash;always chiding, and I love you so! Why could you not
have loved me a little? I will not live to see another woman your
wife. When I leave you to-night I shall be happy, for I shall be
nearing the end of my sufferings. You will see me calm, I shall
tell you I am going home&mdash;'twill not be to Guildford.</p>

<p class="letter">
I have stolen one of Matthew Garnet's knives from his
shop&mdash;'tis wrapped in your handkerchief that you left behind
the day you dressed poor Roreo's foot. I bought some pansies this
morning&mdash;belike you have forgotten how you commended them
once?</p>

'<p class="letter">Twill be a wild night, and I must die in the
dark&mdash;but 'tis a sweet pain that ends a long agony. Oh,
heart, how I have suffered! I have loved you beyond reason and
beyond hope&mdash;and now beyond despair. When this reaches you I
shall be dead&mdash;perhaps they will have found me. Will you see
that they compose me decently for all I was a suicide? Do not
come to see me&mdash;you always hated me, but you will be sorry,
and I do not want your pity.</p>

<p class="letter">I wonder why I want to see
you again? I think it is because I should not have the courage
unless I came straight from your scorn. My head hurts to-day, and
I cannot remember things. Oh, God pity me!</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Hannah Power</span>.</p>

<p><br>
After the discovery of Hannah Power's letter, the Garnets were
frightened into a full confession.</p>

<p>The woman had been taken into the wretched girl's confidence
as regards her feelings towards Mr. Fortis, and had perfectly
understood from her wild behaviour and words she let fall, that
she was going to visit him that evening, and afterwards take her
life.</p>

<p>She had spoken to her husband, who had callously told her to
let things take their course; he was an agent of Mr. Pryor's, and
would be paid heavily for anything that would injure the Member
for Guildford.</p>

<p>Fate Payed into their hands; soon afterwards Hannah Power
returned, gave a letter to Mrs. Garnet and begged her to deliver
it to Mr. Stephen Fortis, who would be under the portico of Wilde
House at midnight, and then ran out again into the wet.</p>

<p>The miserable couple opened the letter, found it to contain
wild and almost incoherent farewells, and destroyed it; Matthew
Garnet now hurried out after Hannah Power, but too late; he
discovered her as she was afterwards found, only with the knife
in her hand; he soon ascertained that she was dead, and at once
conceived the villainous idea of serving the family who were his
patrons, and ruining that to which they were opposed by turning
the suicide into a murder; he cast the knife far away from the
corpse, and detached the pansies and ribbon that had become
stained from the wound; the handkerchief he had found near, and
had thrust it in place of the posy in sheer horror at the wound
disclosed; it was pure chance that it happened to be the
cherished bit of cambric once belonging to Stephen Fortis.</p>

<p>In pursuance of his devilish scheme, he returned to his house,
put on his wife's hood and cloak, returned to the portico, saw
Mr. Fortis, and thrust the pansies into his hand, the object
being to mark the gentleman's clothes with blood even if he threw
the flowers instantly away.</p>

<p>Neither of them knew of the letter which was the means of
discovering the whole conspiracy, and which might never have come
to light but for the condemned man's asking for his Bible.</p>

<p>Matthew Garnet and his wife were transported to Jamaica; the
Powers and Pryors, by utterly abandoning the wretched couple, and
completely denying their allegations, saved themselves a share in
their punishment, but remained hopelessly damaged in prestige and
reputation. Stephen Fortis, pardoned by the King for the crime he
had not committed, was happily married to the brave woman whose
faith in him had never been shaken.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>THE HOUSEKEEPER</h2>

<h3>Reprinted in<br>
<i>Twilight and Other Supernatural Romances by Marjorie Bowen</i>,<br>
Ash-Tree Press, 1998, as "The Confession of Beau Sekforde"</h3>

<p class="first">MR. ROBERT SEKFORDE, a rather damaged man of
fashion, entered, with a lurching step, his mansion near the
tavern of the "Black Bull," High Holborn. He was still known as
"Beau Sekforde," and was still dressed in the extreme of the
fashion of this year 1710, with wide brocade skirts, an immense
peruke, and a quantity of lace and paste ornaments that were
nearly as brilliant as diamonds.</p>

<p>About Mr. Sekforde himself was a good deal of this spurious
gorgeousness; from a little distance he still looked the
magnificent man he once had been, but a closer view showed him
ruddled with powder and rouge like a woman, heavy about the eyes
and jaw, livid in the cheeks; a handsome man yet, but one deeply
marked by years of idleness, good living, and the cheap
dissipations of a nature at once brutal and effeminate. In the
well-shaped features and dark eyes there was not a contour or a
shadow that did not help towards the presentment of a type
vicious and worthless; yet he had an air of breeding, of
gallantry and grace that had hitherto never failed to win him
facile admiration and help him over awkward places in his career.
This air was also spurious&mdash;spurious as the diamonds at his
throat and in his shoe-buckles; he was not even of gentle birth;
the obscurity that hung round his origin was proof of the shame
he felt at the dismal beginning of a career that had been so
brilliant.</p>

<p>He entered his mansion, that was modest but elegant, and
called for candles to be brought into his study.</p>

<p>Taking off slowly his white, scented gloves, he stared
thoughtfully at his plump, smooth hands, and then at the walnut
desk scattered with silver and ebony stand dishes, pens and
taper-holders, and a great number of little notes on gilt-edged
and perfumed papers.</p>

<p>There was a great many others, neither gilt-edged nor
perfumed; Mr. Sekforde knew that these last were bills as surely
as he knew the first were insipid invitations to rather
third-rate balls and routs.</p>

<p>Everything in Mr. Sekforde's world was becoming rather
third-rate now.</p>

<p>He looked round the room desperately with that ugly glance of
defiance which is not courage but cowardice brought to bay.</p>

<p>Nothing in the house was paid for; and his credit would not
last much longer; this had been a last venture to float his shaky
raft on the waters of London society; he could foresee himself
going very comfortably to the bottom.</p>

<p>Unless&mdash;</p>

<p>Unless he could again carry off some successful "coup" at
cards; and this was unlikely; he was too well known now.</p>

<p>Every resource that could, at any pinch, afford means of
livelihood to an unscrupulous rogue and yet permit him to move
among the people on whom he preyed, had already been played by
Mr. Sekforde.</p>

<p>The sound of the opening door caused him to look up; he
dreaded duns, and was not sure of the unpaid servants.</p>

<p>But it was his wife who entered; at sight of her, Beau
Sekforde cursed in a fashion that would have surprised his
genteel admirers, over whose tea-tables he languished so
prettily.</p>

<p>"Oh, pray keep civil," said the lady, in a mincing tone.</p>

<p>She trailed to the fireplace and looked discontentedly at the
logs that were falling into ashes.</p>

<p>"The upholsterer came," she added, "with a bill for near a
thousand guineas&mdash;I had difficulty in sending him away; is
nothing in the house paid for?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a contempt that was more for herself
than for him; she was quite callous and heartless; a sense of
humour, a nice appreciation of men and things alone prevented her
from being odious.</p>

<p>"Lord!" she smiled. "To live to be fooled by Beau
Sekforde!"</p>

<p>She was a Countess in her own right; her patent was from
Charles II. and explained her career; she still had the air of a
beauty, and wore the gowns usually affected by loveliness, but
she was old with the terrible old age of a wanton, soulless
woman.</p>

<p>Her reputation was bad even for her type; she had cheated at
everything from love to cards, and no tenderness or regrets had
ever softened her ugly actions. At the end of her career as
presiding goddess of a gambling saloon she had married Robert
Sekforde, thinking he had money or at least the wits to get it,
and a little betrayed by his glib tongue that had flattered her
into thinking her beauty not lost, her charm not dead, only to
find him an adventurer worse off than herself, who had not even
paid for the clothes in which he had come to woo her; her sole
satisfaction was that he had also been deceived.</p>

<p>He had thought her the prudent guardian of the spoils of a
lifetime; instead, selfishness had caused her to scatter what
greed had gained, and for her too this marriage had been seized
as a chance to avert ruin. Haggard and painted, a dark wig on her
head, false pearls round her throat, and a dirty satin gown
hanging gracefully round a figure still upright and elegant, she
stared at the fire.</p>

<p>"We shall have to disappear," she remarked dryly. He looked at
her with eyes of hate.</p>

<p>"You must have some money," he said bluntly.</p>

<p>Avarice, the vice of old age, flashed in her glance as
jealousy would have gleamed in that of a younger woman.</p>

<p>"What little I have I need," she retorted. "The man has turned
simple." She grinned at her reflection in the glass above the
fireplace.</p>

<p>"Well, leave me, then," he said bitterly; could he be rid of
her, he felt it would gild his misfortune.</p>

<p>But my lady had come to the end of all her admirers; she could
not even any longer dazzle boys with the wicked glory of her
past; she had no one save Mr. Sekforde, and she meant to cling to
him; he was a man, and twenty years younger than herself; he
ought, she thought, to be useful.</p>

<p>Besides, this woman who had never had a friend of her own sex,
shuddered to think of the last loneliness it would be to live
without a man attached to her&mdash;better the grave, and of that
she had all the horror of the true atheist.</p>

<p>"You talk folly," she said with a dreadful ogle. "I shall
remain."</p>

<p>"Then you will starve, my lady!" he flung out violently.</p>

<p>"Oh, fie, sir, one does not starve."</p>

<p>He could not endure to look at her, but staring at the desk,
began to tear up the notes before him.</p>

<p>"Will you not go to a mask to-night?" she asked
querulously.</p>

<p>"I have no money to pay for a chair," he sneered.</p>

<p>"We might win something at cards."</p>

<p>"People are very wary."</p>

<p>"You were very clever at tricking me," remarked the Countess,
"cannot you trick someone else, Mr. Sekforde?"</p>

<p>He wheeled round on her with concentrated venom.</p>

<p>"Ah, madam, if I were a bachelor&mdash;"</p>

<p>She quailed a little before his wrath, but rallied to reply
with the spirit of the woman who had been spoilt by a king:</p>

<p>"You think you are so charming? Wealthy matches are
particular. <i>Look in the glass, sir; your face is as ruined as
your reputation</i>."</p>

<p>He advanced on her and she began to shriek in a dreadful
fashion; the town woman showed through the airs of the great
lady.</p>

<p>"I'll call the watch!" she shrilled.</p>

<p>He fell back with a heavy step and stood glaring at her.</p>

<p>"A pair of fools," said my lady bitterly.</p>

<p>Then her cynical humour triumphed over her disgust.</p>

<p>"Your first wife would smile to see us now," she remarked.</p>

<p>Beau Sekforde turned to her a face suddenly livid.</p>

<p>"What do you know about my first wife?" he demanded
fiercely.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," replied my lady. "You kept her rather in the
background, did you not? But one can guess."</p>

<p>Mr. Sekforde raged; he loathed any reference to the woman whom
he had married in his obscurity, and who had been his drudge in
the background through all his shifting fortunes; her worn face,
her wagging tongue, her rude manners, had combined to make the
thorn in the rose-bed of his softest days.</p>

<p>He had hated her and believed that she had hated him; she was
a Scotchwoman, a shrew, thrifty, honest, plain, and a good
housekeeper; she had always made him very comfortable at home,
though she had shamed him on the rare occasions when she had
forced him to take her abroad.</p>

<p>She had died only a few months before his present
marriage.</p>

<p>"One can guess," repeated the Countess, showing teeth dark
behind her rouged lips in a ghastly grin, "that you made her life
very pleasant."</p>

<p>He sprang up and faced her, a big, heavy bully for all his
satins and French peruke.</p>

<p>"Oh," she shrilled, frightened but defiant, "you look like
murder."</p>

<p>He turned away sharply and muttered some hideous words under
his breath.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked my lady, with a quizzical
glance round the tawdry splendour that had been hired to lure her
into marriage, and that now would be so shortly rent away.</p>

<p>Beau Sekforde controlled his wrath against the terrible woman
who had deceived him into losing his last chance of retrieving
ruin.</p>

<p>"Where are the servants?" he asked.</p>

<p>"All gone. I think they have taken some of the plate and all
the wine. There is some food downstairs."</p>

<p>Mr. Sekforde had seen it as he came up; a hacked piece of fat
ham on a dirty dish, a stained cloth and a jagged loaf had been
laid out on the dining-room table.</p>

<p>"I have had my dinner," remarked the Countess.</p>

<p>Her husband rudely left the room; he was hungry and forced to
search for food, but the remembrance of the meal waiting
nauseated him; he was delicate in his habits, and as he descended
the stairs he thought of his late wife&mdash;she had been a
wonderful housekeeper&mdash;even in poverty she had never failed
to secure comfort.</p>

<p>As he opened the door of the dining-room he was agreeably
surprised.</p>

<p>Evidently one of the servants had remained after all.</p>

<p>The hearth had been swept and a neat fire burnt pleasantly; a
clean cloth was on the table, and the service was set out
exactly; a fresh loaf, butter, wine, fruit, a dish of hot meat,
of cheese, of eggs stood ready; there was wine and brightly
polished glasses.</p>

<p>"I did not know," Mr. Sekforde muttered, "that any of the
hussies in this house could work like this."</p>

<p>He admired the spotless linen, the brilliant china, the
gleaming glasses, the fresh and appetizing food, and ate and
drank with a pleasure that made him forget for the moment his
troubles.</p>

<p>One thing only slightly disturbed his meal; among the dishes
was a plate of goblin scones; they were of a peculiar shape and
taste, and he had never known anyone make them but the late Jane
Sekforde.</p>

<p>When he had finished he rang the bell for candles, for the
short November day was closing in.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Surprised and slightly curious to see the servant who had been
so deft, Mr. Sekforde went to the head of the basement stairs and
shouted lustily; still there was no reply.</p>

<p>He returned to the dining-room; the candles were lit and set
precisely on the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Sekforde ran upstairs to his wife.</p>

<p>"Who is in this house?" he asked in a tone of some
agitation.</p>

<p>The Countess was by the fire, seated on a low chair; before
her on the floor was a wheel of playing cards from which she was
telling her fortune.</p>

<p>"Who is in the house?" she sneered. "A drunken ruffian."</p>

<p>Misery was wearing thin the courtier-like manner from both of
them.</p>

<p>"You old, wicked jade," he replied, "there is someone hiding
in this house."</p>

<p>She rose, scattering the cards with the worn toe of her little
satin shoe.</p>

<p>"There is no one in the house," she said, "not a baggage of
them all would stay. I am going out. I want lights and amusement.
Your house is too dull, Mr. Sekforde."</p>

<p>With this speech and an air that was a caricature of the
graces of a young and beautiful woman she swept out of the
room.</p>

<p>Even her own maid, a disreputable Frenchwoman, had left her,
having moved out of the impending crash; but my lady had never
lacked spirit; she attired herself, put all the money she had in
her bosom, and left the house to pass the evening with one of her
cronies, who kept an establishment similar to that which she had
been forced to abandon.</p>

<p>Even the departure of her vindictive presence did not sweeten
for Beau Sekforde the house that was the temple of his
failure.</p>

<p>He glared at the furniture that should have been paid for by
bills on his wife's fortune, and went to his chamber.</p>

<p>He, too, knew haunts, dark and gleaming, where health and
money, wits and time might be steadily consumed, and where one
who was bankrupt in all these things might be for the time
tolerated if he had a flattering and servile tongue and an
appearance that lent some dignity to mean vices and ignoble
sins.</p>

<p>He found a fire in his bed-chamber, the curtains drawn, his
cloak, evening rapier, and gloves put ready for him, the candles
lit on his dressing-table.</p>

<p>He dressed himself rather soberly and went downstairs.</p>

<p>The meal was cleared away in the dining-room, the fire
covered, the chairs put back in their places.</p>

<p>Beau Sekforde swore.</p>

<p>"If I had not seen her fastened down in her coffin I should
have sworn that Jane was in this house," he muttered, and his
blood-shot eyes winced a little from the gloom of the empty
house.</p>

<p>Again he went to the head of the basement stairs and
listened.</p>

<p>He could hear faintly yet distinctly the sound of someone
moving about&mdash;the sound of dishes, of brisk footstep of
clattering irons.</p>

<p>"Some wench <i>has</i> remained," he said uneasily, but he did
not offer to investigate those concealed kitchen premises.</p>

<p>That evening his companions found him changed&mdash;a quiet,
sullen, dangerous mood was on him; they could easily understand
this, as tales of the disaster of his marriage had already leaked
abroad.</p>

<p>But something deeper and more terrible even than his almost
accomplished ruin was troubling Robert Sekforde.</p>

<p>He returned very late to the mansion in High Holborn; he had
drunk as much wine as his friends would pay for, and there was
little of the elegant gallant about the heavy figure in the
stained coat with wig awry and the flushed, swollen face, who
stumbled into the wretched place he named home with unconscious
sarcasm.</p>

<p>A light stood ready for him in the hall; he took this up and
staggered upstairs, spilling the candle-grease over his lace
ruffles.</p>

<p>Half-way up he paused, suddenly wondering who had thought to
leave the light.</p>

<p>"Not my lady wife&mdash;not my royal Countess," he
grinned.</p>

<p>Then a sudden pang of horror almost sobered him. Jane had
never forgotten to put a candle in the hall. He paused, as if
expecting to hear her shrill, nagging voice.</p>

<p>"You're drunk," he said to himself fiercely; "she is dead,
dead, <i>dead</i>."</p>

<p>He went upstairs.</p>

<p>The fire in his room was bright, the bed stood ready, his
slippers and bedgown were warming, a cup of posset stood steaming
on the side-table.</p>

<p>Mr. Sekforde snatched up his candle and hurried to the room of
the Countess.</p>

<p>He violently entered and stood confronting her great bed with
the red damask hangings.</p>

<p>With a shriek she sat up; her cheeks were still rouged, the
false pearls dangled in her ears, the laced gown was open on her
skinny throat; a cap with pink ribbons concealed her scant grey
hair.</p>

<p>She flung herself, with claw-like hands, on an embroidered
purse on the quilt, and thrust it under her pillow; it contained
her night's winnings at cards.</p>

<p>"Have you come to rob me?" she screamed.</p>

<p>Terror robbed her of all dignity; she crouched in the shadows
of the huge bed, away from the red light cast on her dreadful
face by the candle her husband held.</p>

<p>Beau Sekforde was not thinking of money now, and her words
passed unheeded.</p>

<p>"Who is in this house?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"You are mad," she said, a little recovering her composure,
but keeping her hands very firmly on the purse beneath the
pillow; "there is no one in this house."</p>

<p>"Did <i>you</i> put a candle for me and prepare my room and
light the fire and place the posset?"</p>

<p>He spoke thickly and leant against the bed-post; the candle,
now almost guttered away, sent a spill of grease on the heavy
quilt.</p>

<p>"You are drunk, you monstrous man!" screamed my lady. "If you
are not away instantly I'll put my head out of the window and
screech the neighbourhood up!"</p>

<p>Beau Sekforde, regarding her with dull eyes, remained at his
original point.</p>

<p>"There was someone in the kitchen this afternoon," he
insisted. "I heard sounds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rats," said my lady; "the house is full of 'em."</p>

<p>A look of relief passed over the man's sodden features.</p>

<p>"Of course, rats," he muttered.</p>

<p>"What else could it be?" asked the Countess, sufficiently
impressed by his strange manner momentarily to forget her
grievance against him.</p>

<p>"What else?" he repeated; then suddenly turned on her with
fury, lurching the candle into her face.</p>

<p>"Could rats have set <i>this</i> for me?" he shouted.</p>

<p>The Countess shrank back; when agitated her head trembled with
incipient palsy, and now it trembled so that the false pearls
rattled hollow against her bony neck.</p>

<p>"You will fire the bed-curtains!" she shrilled
desperately.</p>

<p>He trembled with a loathing of her that was like a panic fear
of fury.</p>

<p>"You time-foundered creature!" he cried. "You bitter horror!
And 'twas for you I did it!"</p>

<p>She sprang to her knees in the bed, her hands crooked as if
ready for his face; there was nothing left now of the fine dame
nurtured in courts, the beauty nursed in the laps of princes. She
had reverted to the wench of Drury Lane, screaming abuse from
alley to alley.</p>

<p>"If you are disappointed, what about me?" she shrieked. "Have
I not tied myself to a low, ugly fool?"</p>

<p>He stepped back from her as if he did not understand her, and,
muttering, staggered back into his own room.</p>

<p>There he lit all the candles, piled up the fire with more
fuel, glanced with horror at the bed, flung off his coat and wig,
and settled himself in the chair with arms before the fire to
sleep.</p>

<p>The Countess, roused and angered, could sleep no more.</p>

<p>She rose, flung on a chamber-robe of yellow satin lined with
marten's fur, that was a relic of her court days and threadbare
and moth-eaten in places, though giving the effect of much
splendour.</p>

<p>Without striking a light she went cautiously out into the
corridor, saw the door of her husband's room ajar, a bright glow
from it falling across the darkness, and crept steadily in.</p>

<p>He was, as she had supposed, in an intoxicated stupor of sleep
by the fire.</p>

<p>His head had sunk forward on the stained and untied lace
cravat on his breast; his wigless head showed fat and shaven and
grey over the temples, his face was a dull purple, and his mouth
hung open.</p>

<p>His great frame was almost as loose as that of a man newly
dead, his hands hung slack, and his chest heaved with his noisy
breathing. My lady was herself a horrid object, but that did not
prevent her giving hint a glance of genuine disgust.</p>

<p>"Beau Sekforde indeed!" she muttered.</p>

<p>She put out all the candles save two on the dressing-table,
found the coat her husband had flung off, and began going swiftly
through the pockets.</p>

<p>He had been, as she had hoped, fortunate at cards that night;
he was indeed, like herself, of a type who seldom was
unfortunate, since he only played with fools or honest men,
neither of whom had any chance against the peculiar talents of
the sharper.</p>

<p>The Countess found sundry pieces of gold and silver, which she
knotted up in her handkerchief with much satisfaction.</p>

<p>She knew that nothing but money would ever be able to be of
any service to her in this world.</p>

<p>Pleased with her success, she looked round to see if there
were anything else of which she could despoil her husband.</p>

<p>Keeping her cunning old eyes constantly on him, she crept to
the dressing-table and went over the drawers and boxes.</p>

<p>Most of the ornaments that she turned out glittered and
gleamed heavily in the candle-light. But she knew that they were
as false as the pearls trembling in her own ears; one or two
things, however, she added to the money in the handkerchief, and
she was about to investigate further when a little sound, like a
cough, caused her to look sharply round.</p>

<p>The room was full of warm shadows, the fire was sinking low
and only cast a dim light on the heavy, sleeping figure on the
hearth, while the candle-sticks on the dressing-table served only
to illuminate the bent figure of the Countess in her brilliant
wrap.</p>

<p>As she looked round she found herself staring straight at the
figure of a woman, who was observing her from the other side of
the bed.</p>

<p>This woman was dressed in a grey tabinet fashioned like the
dress of an upper servant. Her hair was smoothly banded, and her
features were pale and sharp; her hands, that she held rather
awkwardly in front of her, were rough and work-worn.</p>

<p>Across one cheek was a long scratch.</p>

<p>The Countess dropped her spoils; she remembered her husband's
words that she had taken for the babbling of a drunkard.</p>

<p>So there <i>was</i> someone in the house.</p>

<p>"How dare you?" she quavered, and in a low tone, for she did
not wish to rouse her husband. "How dare you come here?"</p>

<p>Without replying the woman moved across to the sleeping man
and looked down at him with an extraordinary expression of
mingled malice and protection, as if she would defend him from
any evil save that she chose to deal herself.</p>

<p>So sinister was this expression and the woman's whole attitude
that the Countess was frightened as she never had been in the
course of her wicked life.</p>

<p>She stood staring the handkerchief, full of money and
ornaments, dropped on the dressing-table unheeded.</p>

<p>Beau Sekforde moved in his sleep and fetched a deep groan.</p>

<p>"You impertinent creature!" whispered the Countess, taking
courage. "Will you not go before I wake my husband?"</p>

<p>At these last words the woman raised her head; she did not
seem to speak, yet, as if there were an echo in the room, the
Countess distinctly heard the words "My husband!" repeated after
her in a tone of bitter mockery.</p>

<p>A sense of unreality such as she had never known before
touched the Countess; she felt as if her sight were growing dim
and her hearing failing her; she made a movement as if to brush
something from before her eyes.</p>

<p>When she looked again at Beau Sekforde he was alone; no one
was beside him.</p>

<p>In dreaming, tortured sleep he groaned and tossed.</p>

<p>"The baggage has slipped off," muttered the Countess; "belike
it is some ancient dear of his own. I will send her away in the
morning."</p>

<p>She crept back to her own room, forgetting her spoils.</p>

<p>She did not sleep, and Mr. Sekforde did not wake till the pale
winter dawn showed between the curtains.</p>

<p>The Countess looked round on a chamber in disorder, but for
Beau Sekforde everything was arranged, shaving water ready, his
breakfast hot and tempting on a tray, his clothes laid out.</p>

<p>When he had dressed and come downstairs he found his wife
yawning over a copy of the <i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>She remembered last night quite clearly, and considerably
regretted what she had left behind in Beau Sekforde's room in her
confusion.</p>

<p>She gave him a glance, vicious with the sense of an
opportunity lost.</p>

<p>He flung at her the question he had shouted last night. "Who
is in this house?"</p>

<p>"Some woman has stayed," she answered. "I think it was Joanna
the housekeeper, but I did not see very clearly. She must be out
now, as I have rung the bell and there has been no answer."</p>

<p>"My breakfast was brought up to me," said Mr. Sekforde. "So it
is Joanna Mills, is it?"</p>

<p>The Countess was angry; she had had to go to the kitchen and
pick among yesterday's scraps for her own food.</p>

<p>"And who is she?"</p>

<p>"You said, madam, the housekeeper."</p>

<p>"She must be very fond of you," sneered my lady. He started at
that and turned on her a ghastly look. "Oh, don't think I am
jealous!" she grinned cynically.</p>

<p>"It was the word you used," he muttered. "I do not think
anyone has been <i>fond</i> of me save one&mdash;" He paused and
passed his hand over his weary, heavy eyes.</p>

<p>"I dreamt of her last night."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Jane, my wife."</p>

<p>The Countess remembered the ugly echo of her words last
night.</p>

<p>"Your wife&mdash;do you forget that I and no other am your
wife?"</p>

<p>"I do," he replied sullenly; "to me Jane is always my
wife."</p>

<p>"A pity," said my lady sarcastically, "that she did not live
longer."</p>

<p>He gave her a queer look.</p>

<p>"And now we have got to think of ourselves," he said abruptly.
"I cannot keep these things much longer&mdash;you had better
go."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"What do I care?" he answered cruelly.</p>

<p>"I stay here," she replied. "Is the rent paid?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, they will not disturb us till quarter-day," said my
lady calmly. "You do not want to be parted from your loving wife,
do you, dear?"</p>

<p>He stared at her as if her words had a double meaning.</p>

<p>"Cannot you be quiet about my wife?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"La! The man is off his head!" shrilled my lady. "Jane
Sekforde is dead!"</p>

<p>"That is why I think about her," he retorted grimly.</p>

<p>"A model husband," jeered the Countess, eyeing him viciously.
"I am sorry I never knew the sweet creature you regret so keenly
and so touchingly."</p>

<p>He raged at her like a man whose nerves are overwrought.</p>

<p>"Will you not let the matter be? Think of yourself, you
monstrous horror! You will soon be in the Fleet!"</p>

<p>This picture was sufficiently realistic to make the Countess
shiver.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" she asked with sudden
feebleness.</p>

<p>He did not know; brooding and black-browed, he withdrew to the
window-place and stared out at the leaden November sky that hung
so heavily over the London streets.</p>

<p>"I suppose if you were free of me you would take your handsome
face to market again?" added my lady, with a sudden flash of new
fury.</p>

<p>He gave her a red look, at which she shrank away.</p>

<p>"Well, still we do not decide on anything," she quavered.</p>

<p>He would not answer her, but flung out of the house.</p>

<p>His unsteady steps were directed to St. Andrew's Church.</p>

<p>It was a long time since Beau Sekforde had been near a
church.</p>

<p>Even when his wife had been buried here he had not attended
the service.</p>

<p>He stood now in the porch, biting his thumb; then presently he
entered.</p>

<p>Hesitating and furtive he went round the walls until he came
to the new, cheap tablet with the badly cut draped urn and the
florid Latin setting forth the virtues of Jane Sekforde.</p>

<p>"They don't say anything about her being a good housekeeper,"
he found himself saying aloud. "Why, she told me once she would
come back from the grave to set her house in order."</p>

<p>He looked round as if to seek the answer of some companion,
then laughed sullenly, drew his hat over his eyes, and left the
church.</p>

<p>Towards dusk he wandered home.</p>

<p>The dining-room was neat and clean, the fire attended to, the
dinner on the table. He managed to eat some of the food, but
without appetite. The Countess was out; there was no trace
anywhere of her slovenly splendour.</p>

<p>The whole house was as clean and precise as it had been when
that neglected drudge, Jane Sekforde, had ruled over it.</p>

<p>When the Countess returned he was almost glad to see
her&mdash;he had been thinking so much, too much, of Jane.</p>

<p>He had thought of her as he had seen her last, cold in her
bed, clothed in her best grey gown, and how he had stared at her
and hung over her and drawn suddenly away, so sharply that the
button of cut steel on his cuff had left a scratch on her dead
cheek.</p>

<p>"Where is Joanna Mills?" he abruptly asked his wife.</p>

<p>She stared at him; in such a moment as this could he think of
nothing but the housekeeper? Was he losing his wits?</p>

<p>But she did not now much care; she had found a crony willing
to shelter her and exploit her ancient glories.</p>

<p>"I am going away," she said. "I do not know who is in the
house&mdash;I have seen no one."</p>

<p>He seemed to pay no attention at all to her first remark.</p>

<p>"What was that woman you saw last night like?"</p>

<p>"A very plain, shrewish-looking creature," replied my lady,
with some bitterness, as she recalled how she had been startled
into dropping the filched money.</p>

<p>"Are you sure it was a woman?" asked Beau Sekforde with a
ghastly grin.</p>

<p>"Why, what else could it have been?" she replied
curiously.</p>

<p>"I do not think it has been a woman for&mdash;some months," he
said.</p>

<p>"Why, do you imagine there is a spectre in the place?"</p>

<p>He would not, could not answer; he left her, and went from
room to room throwing everything into disorder, taking a horrid
pleasure in making a confusion in the neatness of the house.</p>

<p>And then he flung himself away from the dreary mansion,
leaving the Countess, like an old, weary bird of prey, wandering
among the untidy rooms to see if there were anything worth taking
away.</p>

<p>When he returned in the dark hours before the dawn he found
the candle on the hall table.</p>

<p>"Curse you!" he screamed. "Cannot you let me alone?"</p>

<p>He hastened upstairs; everything was neat, his bed, his fire,
his posset ready, his shoes warming, his candles lit.</p>

<p>His terrified eyes cast a horrid glance round the room.</p>

<p>"The medicine cupboard&mdash;has she tidied that?" he
muttered.</p>

<p>He crossed to where it hung in one corner, opened the door,
and looked at the rows of pots and bottles.</p>

<p>One he knew well had been stained&mdash;had been left with a
broken stopper...a bottle of a peculiar, ugly look, holding a
yellow liquid that stained linen purple.</p>

<p>Such a stain, very tiny, had been on Jane Sekforde's
pillow.</p>

<p>As he stared into the cupboard he saw that the bottle had been
cleaned and set in its place, while a new, neat label had been
pasted on the front.</p>

<p>The writing was the writing of Jane Sekforde&mdash;it said in
clear letters, "<i>Poison</i>."</p>

<p>Beau Sekforde dropped the candle and ran into the Countess'
room.</p>

<p>"Wake up!" he shouted. "Wake up and hear me! She has come
back. I want to confess. I murdered her! Let them take me
away&mdash;somewhere where&mdash;where she cannot tidy for
me."</p>

<p>The room was empty of the Countess, who had fled; an unnatural
light came from the unshuttered windows and showed a woman
sitting up in the great bed.</p>

<p>She had a pale, shrewish face, a grey garment on, and a
scratch across her cheek.</p>

<p>As the shrieks of Beau Sekforde's confession echoed into the
night and drew the watch to thunder on the door, the woman
smiled.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">IT was a night so terrible that man's trust in
God might well be shaken.</p>

<p>For days the snow had lain frozen on the ground, and a dark
and bitter fog had overhung London. By three o'clock the day was
over, by four it was dark. Neither by day nor night was there any
lift in the heavy snow pall that covered the sky&mdash;there was
neither wind nor snow, only the intense, penetrating cold; even
in the country, miles away from the smoke of the city, it was not
possible to see farther than across the road; the hoary white,
frozen fog blotted out everything save the objects close at
hand.</p>

<p>All houses, trees, fields, the few passers-by, the sparse
traffic, seemed cast out of lead, colourless, hard, immobile even
in the busiest parts of the town. Here, now night had fallen, in
this lonely part of Hampstead, neither man nor beast was abroad
nor had been for several nights. Yet a man stood in the doorway
of a great solitary mansion on the Heath, obviously peering out
into the white, frozen obscurity and waiting for some
arrival.</p>

<p>The house stood black and shuttered within the bleak, barren,
and high-walled garden; only from behind the watcher at the door
showed a thin glow of light which faintly penetrated the fog. The
silence was complete and profound; the situation of the house was
in any case lonely, being well off the high road and on an
isolated portion of the Heath. Casual passers-by seldom came that
way even in the daytime and in fine weather; now it seemed as
divided from the world as if it were some outpost of the infernal
regions.</p>

<p>The watcher at the door, muffled to the chin in a fur-lined
greatcoat and with a beaver hat pulled over his eyes, took an
impatient step or two into the garden. The icy snow crunched
under his feet, the freezing air bit his face, he strained sight
and hearing, but all was veiled and silent; the cold made him
shudder to his heart.</p>

<p>He turned back to the house, leaving the hall door ajar behind
him, and entered one of the shuttered rooms at the back of the
house.</p>

<p>A large fire burnt on the hearth, but the chamber was neither
warm nor comfortable; it had no aspect of having ever been lived
in; the heavy tapestry furniture was in holland covers, the
massive chandelier was concealed by a bag of brown muslin; over
the mirror above the large mantelpiece was also drawn muslin, the
ormolu clock was not going, the polished floor, the painted
ceiling were alike dusty. The two sconces either side the hearth
had been filled with wax lights and lit; untended, they had
dripped over the silver gilt in drops of wax.</p>

<p>On the green marble-topped table stood several fine decanters
of wine and spirits and tankards and glass, also some delicate
china plates, and a large fruit cake on a gilt salver.</p>

<p>By the fire, in a deep easy-chair drawn close to the blaze,
sat a terrible-looking man of about sixty&mdash;fat, diseased,
bloated, in the garb of a clergyman. His worn peruke hung on the
back of his chair, his bald dirty head shone in the red
candle-light; he was drinking from a big mug of punch and staring
with bleared eyes into the fire, on which a great kettle was
boiling. Several bottles stood beside him on the floor; beside
them was a dog-eared Bible and soiled prayer-book.</p>

<p>The man who had been waiting at the door looked at him with
disgust and fury.</p>

<p>"You need not get drunk yet, Atkinson," he remarked
fiercely.</p>

<p>"I'm not drunk, my lord," returned the other thickly, "but we
must keep the cold out&mdash;a night like this." He looked round
at the young man with a very ugly leer. "So they have not come
yet?" he added. "Have a drink yourself, Lord Massingham."</p>

<p>My lord cursed forcibly; he flung his hat on to one of the
shrouded chairs and loosened his coat at the throat, showing the
close folds of his fine cambric cravat and revealing the features
so well known and so well hated, also sometimes so foolishly
loved.</p>

<p>He was handsome because he was young; when he should be as old
as the man by the fire he would probably be as hideous; vitality
and health were all there was to give charm and power to the
finely cast and vividly coloured face. He wore a plain riding
suit of dark blue silk and no jewels; his hair, of a dark, dull
brown colour, hung loosely in its own natural and becoming wave
and was tied by a narrow black ribbon; yet he was very plainly of
the great world, his movements were full of trained grace, his
manners of arrogance.</p>

<p>"Supposing they do not come?" asked the jackal by the
fire.</p>

<p>My lord paled at this insolence on the part of his creature.
At his look the other cringed.</p>

<p>"Such a night, I mean," he explained feebly, and swallowed a
great draught of punch.</p>

<p>My lord swung on him and shook his fat shoulder.</p>

<p>"If you are too drunk to read the service I'll run you
through," he snarled.</p>

<p>Before the terrified wretch could answer, a low clear whistle
sounded through the stillness. My lord hurried to the front door
and opened it wide on to the dreadful night.</p>

<p>A blurred and ghastly light shone through the cold fog; soon
this showed as two lanterns, which came nearer up the path; snow
and ice crackled beneath footsteps, hoarse whispering sounded,
black shadows appeared, detached from the surrounding gloom by
that nebulous light; Lord Massingham picked up the lanthorn that
stood ready in the hall and went out to meet an approaching group
of men, who came slowly as if staggering under some burden.</p>

<p>My lord no longer felt the cold; the blood burnt hot in his
cheeks. He swung up his light and seized the first figure by the
arm.</p>

<p>"Have you got her?" he asked with fierce eagerness.</p>

<p>The other, who was muffled to the eyes and limped in his walk,
answered with equally fierce brevity.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>Lord Massingham laughed.</p>

<p>"I knew you would. You are a good fellow after all, Jack," he
whispered.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," sneered the other. "A good fellow, Harry."</p>

<p>"How is it you are on foot?" questioned my lord.</p>

<p>"Confound you! The horses could not keep the road. I had to
leave the coach at the edge of the Heath."</p>

<p>"Well, you are here," answered Lord Massingham with that
scornful and impatient kindness he sometimes threw this chief of
all his jackals, "and you have got the girl."</p>

<p>"She did not come willingly, after all," said the jackal in an
ugly voice. "I hope you have provided the parson, for she is very
nice in her notions and will likely do a mischief to someone if
she is desperate." So the two, speaking in low tones, passed from
the bleak darkness into the bleak house. When they were in the
hall the newcomer pushed back his hat, and the beams of the
lantern that Lord Massingham held revealed the likeness between
the two men.</p>

<p>They were brothers, and the family resemblance was strong,
only the dark features of the younger were clouded by a double
bitterness: the sting of his deformed foot and the sting of his
subordinate position. With passions and tastes, pride and desires
equal to his brother, he had always had to cringe for his living
on his elder, who had everything.</p>

<p>They were known, in the evil world to which they belonged, by
hideous nicknames; a third brother who was in the Church being
called Bishopsgate, the Hon. Jack Mervyn was called Cripplegate,
and my lord the Earl designated by the ferocious title of
Hellgate.</p>

<p>The Earl returned to the lit room with a smile of satisfaction
on his triumphant face. The enterprise he had on hand was a
daring one, even for him; no less than the abduction, to be
followed by the mock marriage (then such a fashionable device
among the men of the fashionable world), of the most charming and
popular actress in London, Lavinia Bellamy, who had hitherto
withstood the pleas and devices of all her lovers, and had
maintained a discreet behaviour that had greatly enhanced her
value in the eyes of her admirers. The fact that it was reported
that her coldness was due to a secret attachment to a poor member
of her own profession had whetted Lord Massingham's zeal in his
present outrage, planned with a care he had given to few of his
intrigues.</p>

<p>There was, to him, an added and peculiar attraction in the
fact that, while he was taking such trouble to gain possession of
this poor actress partly by force, partly by deception, he was
betrothed to his cousin, the Lady Dorothy Fenton, a great match
and a Duke's daughter, whose considerable fortune was a necessity
for his exhausted estates.</p>

<p>This false secret marriage with one beautiful and famous
woman, to be followed so shortly by another marriage with a woman
also famous and beautiful and of his own rank and world, appealed
to many passions in the dark heart of Lord Massingham.</p>

<p>The mock parson cocked a bleary eye up at his master's haughty
and vindictive presence, fetched a groan and was about to take
another draught of punch.</p>

<p>Lord Massingham dashed the mug from his lips and it shivered
on the iron firedogs.</p>

<p>"The little fool is to think that you are a parson, Atkinson,
do you hear?" he commanded.</p>

<p>The tipsy wretch tried to pull himself together.</p>

<p>"So Cripplegate has got her, has he?" he stuttered,
straightening his clerical cravat with unsteady fingers. "I hope
there will be no scenes." He shook his head with stupid
gravity.</p>

<p>My lord smiled confidently.</p>

<p>"The wench will be very pleased to be made a Countess," he
replied, "especially as there is no other way out of it."</p>

<p>As he spoke the younger brother entered, bringing with him a
blast of bitter air and flinging aside his heavy cloak, on which
his breath lay frozen, from his neck and shoulders.</p>

<p>"I wonder what Dorothy would say to this night's work," he
remarked quietly.</p>

<p>The Earl turned on him with an impulsive movement as if he
would have flung himself at his throat, then restrained himself
contemptuously; he had other things to do besides punishing the
insolence of Cripplegate.</p>

<p>"If you mention that name in this place again I will thrash
you," he remarked. "Where is the woman?"</p>

<p>His brother smiled straight into his angry eyes.</p>

<p>"I told Griffiths and Savage to bring her in," he replied.</p>

<p>Almost as he spoke the door was pushed open and two stout,
masked men entered, dragging between them the wretched occupant
of the gilt sedan.</p>

<p>She wore a very full cardinal of quilted red sarcenet; beneath
showed the white and gold of her evening petticoats and her
high-heeled satin shoes covered with the slush of the trodden
ice. Her scarf of gold and blue striped gauze was wound round her
head and face, beneath could be seen the white of the
handkerchief with which she was tightly gagged. The elaborate
structure of her hair had been disarranged in her
struggles&mdash;pomaded curls, pink velvet roses, and a broken
braid of pearls showed on her bosom, falling from beneath her
hood.</p>

<p>She was either unconscious or utterly exhausted, for her limbs
fell slack and her head hung from side to side. There was nothing
left now of the beauty and charm that had provoked this vile
robbery; she looked merely helpless and piteous, broken and
humiliated in the grip of her captors.</p>

<p>Some vague stirrings of compassion touched the Earl's hard
heart as he looked at her; as usual he vented himself on his
brother.</p>

<p>"Was there any need to use her like this?" he frowned.</p>

<p>"She would have shrieked all the way&mdash;she fought like a
cat."</p>

<p>"I think it strange," said my lord sharply, "that she did not
come more easily."</p>

<p>He flattered himself that he had made an impression on the
heart of the fair actress, and that she would not have been so
unwilling as Cripplegate said he had found her. He swung round on
the lady with what tenderness he could muster and addressed her
in those terms of spurious gallantry in which he was so
practised.</p>

<p>"Madam, compose yourself; you know whom you are with and what
feelings hurried me to this seeming violence."</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice she seemed to start into life,
recoiled from him deeper into the arms of her captors, and flung
her shuddering hands up to her bound face.</p>

<p>"Madam, take heart; Lavinia, trust to me," continued the Earl
with his grand air. "Here is a clergyman present who will marry
us." He took the woman from her guards and set her on a chair by
the table; she still had her hands so tightly pressed against her
face that he could not remove the gag that held her silent.</p>

<p>Atkinson, the bogus parson, had now hustled the two ruffians
who had brought in the woman out of the room and sent them
downstairs to eat and sleep in the hall where the gilt sedan
chair had been placed.</p>

<p>"You will be needed presently," he said. "My lord will have
the lady sent into the country; you must take her to the
coach."</p>

<p>"'Tis lost on the Heath," replied one of the men with a grin,
and he began to describe the dangers and difficulties of this
dangerous abduction&mdash;how they had carried the wench away
from her escort in the fog and the crowd leaving the theatre, how
they had placed her in the gilt sedan, in the great coach and how
Cripplegate had gagged and bound her and driven the coach,
himself, with two of his fellows on the box beside him and one
clinging to the straps behind.</p>

<p>Atkinson stopped the tale.</p>

<p>"I hope Hellgate has not gone too far," he said with a
quivering mouth. "There will be a hue and cry over this
girl."</p>

<p>He returned up the bleak, unlit stairs to the cold splendour
of the great, shrouded room where he had left the two brothers
and their victim. Despite the wine he had drunk to give himself
courage, he would have liked to have washed his hands of the
whole business. He entered the room on tiptoe like one prepared
for an ugly sight.</p>

<p>My lord had unknotted the bandages from the woman's face, and
she was seated at the table by the wine and fruit, glasses and
dishes, her countenance hidden in her hands, her body crouched
into the recesses of the chair, her whole body still.</p>

<p>The Earl was bending over her, endeavouring to force on her a
glass of spirit; Cripplegate stood by the fire, which he had just
piled up with fresh logs, and smiled at both of them.</p>

<p>There was something very sinister about the appearance of this
lame young man. He wore the costume of wealth and elegance, pale
apricot coloured satins embroidered with gold and scarlet thread,
a muslin cravat with a paste buckle, hair pomaded and
powdered&mdash;all of which showed now that he had put aside his
heavy travelling coat and the slouch hat that had served to
disguise him.</p>

<p>His face was wide and fine, like his brother's, but a peculiar
length of eyes, nostrils, and lips, a sharpness in the
cheek-bones and chin, joined to his cold and sneering expression,
gave him a very unpleasant appearance. His lameness affected his
whole body, the shoulder of the left side dropped, and the
balance of his figure was thrown out from the waist; this,
however, the rich, heavy clothes partially concealed, and the
actual deformity of the foot and leg was hidden by the high
leather boots he wore, in strange contrast to his evening
attire.</p>

<p>The Earl's short patience with the wretched object of his
villainy came to an end.</p>

<p>"Lavinia, this is folly! Lift up your face&mdash;look at me! I
swear there is no harm intended&mdash;look up before you anger
me."</p>

<p>The woman suddenly dropped her cold stiff hands and looked at
him with utter horror in her disfigured face.</p>

<p>Surrounded by the fallen hair in which the broken braid of
pearls and the velvet flower showed as if in mockery, her
features, sharp with fear and anguish, showed pallid and bruised
in the candle-light. Her mouth was swollen and discoloured from
the gag, her cheeks marked, a little stain of dried blood on one
of her temples showed where she had wounded herself in her
frantic attempts to leave the coach; her throat was so dry, her
lips so numb, that she could hardly speak.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you!" she stammered. Her desperate eyes shuddered
away from the Earl and rested on the man in the clergyman's dress
with the prayer-book in his hand. He, staring at her, looked
swiftly at my lord, for he knew that this was not Lavinia
Bellamy.</p>

<p>My lord could not speak; in all his wicked manhood he had
never faced such a moment as this.</p>

<p>The victim of this foul attempt was not the poor actress,
whose fate would merely cause a smile or a shrug, but Lady
Dorothy, the daughter of a Duke, for whose defence all the
gentlemen of England would come forward&mdash;Dorothy the
heiress, the toast, the aristocrat&mdash;his own promised
bride.</p>

<p>He turned about and his glance fell on the face of
Cripplegate, distorted by a hideous sneer of triumph. With a
dreadful cry the elder brother flung himself on the younger, and
the two closed in a fierce embrace of hatred.</p>

<p>Lady Dorothy did not move; a little warmth and colour was
coming into her face, more life into her eyes; she gave a
shuddering sigh.</p>

<p>Atkinson hurled himself on the brothers, and being a stout man
and a desperate one, drove them apart.</p>

<p>"Why did you not let them kill each other?" asked Lady Dorothy
hysterically. "It would have been better so." She moved stiffly
towards the fire. "I am so cold," she added faintly.</p>

<p>Atkinson fetched her the glass of spirits the Earl had poured
out for her, and this time she put it to her lips and drank a
little.</p>

<p>In some way as she moved to the fire, she seemed to dominate
the three men, and they, so lately her arrogant captors, appeared
now but as her slaves. She was no silly damsel, but a woman of
wit and intellect, of pride and character. Her beauty was
eclipsed, bruised, and draggled as no one could ever have
believed that such a sheltered beauty could be; she stood in
strange surroundings, facing a strange company, but she was no
longer broken; now that her first physical pain and suffering was
eased, now that she was free and warm, her pride outweighed her
humiliation.</p>

<p>Her attitude was as if she held a whip in her taut hands.</p>

<p>"Madam," said the Earl, not looking at her, and in muffled
tones, "I will take you home."</p>

<p>"Like this?" she asked. "It will be dawn before we reach St.
James's Square. What tale shall we tell?"</p>

<p>My lord groaned in very anguish; his first wild thought was to
marry her instantly&mdash;if this ruffian had but been really in
holy orders!</p>

<p>"What can I offer&mdash;what can I say?" he muttered, then
stumbled over the word "marriage."</p>

<p>Her bitter contempt made him wince like a struck dog.</p>

<p>"There can be no talk of marriage between you and me, my
lord!" she said, and her voice was now strong and clear. "But, by
Heaven, there may be some talk of other things!"</p>

<p>He saw her lost&mdash;her and her money, and her beauty and
her rank; he tried not to think of Cripplegate until he had
adjusted this terrible situation with her, for if he had thought
of him he must have turned and slain him with his bare hands.
Lady Dorothy put her hands to her forehead; for a moment she
seemed bewildered by the enormity of what had happened; she cried
out to the younger brother with a note of feminine woe.</p>

<p>"Why did you do this thing?" she asked. "What harm did I ever
do to you that you should thus ruin me&mdash;all of us?"</p>

<p>Cripplegate gave her an evil look; he knew that her agony was
the sharper because she had nearly loved the Earl and might have
loved him had this never happened, for he was very attractive to
high-spirited women; it was this stifled, slain passion that she
lamented, all unconsciously, through all her despair.</p>

<p>"Both you and my lord thought me not worth
your&mdash;consideration," said Cripplegate. "It was foolish,
madam, very foolish."</p>

<p>"You did this for sheer malice, then&mdash;for sheer hatred of
him and me?"</p>

<p>"For hatred of the whole proud pack of you."</p>

<p>It was the scoundrel outcast, the despised black sheep, who
spoke, the man trodden on, spurned, who had at last stung, in the
fullness of his vengeance, those who had bruised him, heart and
soul, all his evil life.</p>

<p>Lady Dorothy made no attempt to answer flout with flout, nor
fury with fury; in the exaltation of her supreme misery she was
beyond all outward manifestations of passion.</p>

<p>"All hates may be satisfied now," she said quietly; "we are
ruined."</p>

<p>She spoke of herself and her kin who would never, any of them,
be able to recover from the disgrace of this night's work, but
the Earl took her words for himself. He certainly was ruined; in
no way could he reinstate himself in the eyes of his promised
wife nor in those of her family; before the world he was lost and
dishonoured, there was no means of expiation, there would be a
scandal that would mount to the heavens, not to be concealed,
avoided&mdash;blotted out.</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do?" she asked, staring at him.</p>

<p>He replied like one stupid and amazed:</p>

<p>"You believe I never meant this?"</p>

<p>But by these words he showed that his usual knowledge of women
had failed him, for he called to her mind the bitterest part of
his offence; she might have found possible to condone some
outrage inspired by love of herself, for she was a creature of
high passions and of a romantic temperament; but to have been the
victim of the insult designed for another woman was the
unforgivable sin.</p>

<p>"No," she answered. "You were expecting Lavinia Bellamy, the
actress...You meant to have married her&mdash;three weeks before
our wedding-day, my lord!"</p>

<p>Her wavering finger pointed scorn at the pair of them.</p>

<p>"The fair name you have tarnished demands that one of you
pays," she continued, "with life itself. Take up your weapons,
sir, if you have any manhood left."</p>

<p>"I would fight, but not in your presence, cousin Dorothy,"
returned the pallid Earl.</p>

<p>"Have I not seen enough to-night&mdash;do I not know enough
now that I shall be frightened with a little blood?"</p>

<p>My lord came a step towards her.</p>

<p>"Whatever my follies may be, I swear I hold you dearest of
women, and as for what this fiend has devised for our
undoing&mdash;I would have died sooner than it should have
happened!"</p>

<p>He spoke in all sincerity and she must have known it, but his
crime was beyond all palliative.</p>

<p>"You see," sneered Cripplegate, "he can turn even this
occasion into a pretty speech!"</p>

<p>My lord ignored this; he looked only at his cousin.</p>

<p>"What do you demand of me?" he asked. "I will do
anything."</p>

<p>"Kill your brother or be killed by him," she replied.</p>

<p>"By God, I will!" he replied. His spirit leapt to meet hers;
nearer had he so admired her as at that moment of utter loss and
anguish.</p>

<p>Cripplegate shrugged his uneven shoulders. This much of his
breed showed in him that he made no effort to shirk the
consequences of his action; he also stood to lose all by this
night's work, and must have known it when he first planned his
mad revenge.</p>

<p>"This is all that you can do for me," said Lady Dorothy to the
Earl. "Kill that man."</p>

<p>Both the brothers cried out so instantly, "I am ready!" that
it sounded like one voice; but Atkinson, moved by Heaven knows
what obscure impulses and dread, what long-forgotten horrors and
codes, again flung himself between the young men.</p>

<p>"Madam," he gasped, "you cannot permit this thing&mdash;this
cannot be settled here and now&mdash;have pity on these
unfortunate gentlemen!"</p>

<p>She interrupted him with such force that it seemed as if the
words were struck out of his mouth, and he cowered back into
silence as if he had received a blow over the heart.</p>

<p>"Come from between them, you more than vile!" she cried. Again
she spoke to the Earl.</p>

<p>"Why do you waste time?"</p>

<p>He swung his sword out, but she would not have this.</p>

<p>"That weapon is for honourable men," she said; she turned to
the younger brother's coat that was flung across a chair by the
fire and from the pocket of it took the case of pistols; these
arms had been used against her escort; she had heard one man fall
groaning.</p>

<p>She put the case on the table among the glasses and wine
bottles, the cake and fruit.</p>

<p>"Take these," she said.</p>

<p>The brothers moved as if there were no choice but to obey her;
they examined the weapons quietly.</p>

<p>"Load them!" she commanded.</p>

<p>The clock struck two; the sound a little shook her from her
bitter calm; she thought of those searching for her in the
ghastly cold and dark, of the grief and misery about to be
entailed on all those who loved her and whom she loved, and she,
faltering, recoiled from her fate.</p>

<p>The pistols were loaded now, and each had examined that of the
other, under the eyes of Lady Dorothy.</p>

<p>"It is plain murder&mdash;without seconds, without a surgeon,"
gibbered Atkinson, crouching against the wall.</p>

<p>The light was uncertain, the room full of leaping shadows, for
the fire was blazing in great flames and the candles had guttered
to their sockets. By this shuddering light the two men faced each
other.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;across the table," said the Earl.</p>

<p>He gave a wild look at the woman by the fire; her red and pink
clothes were gleaming in the lustrous folds of silk and satins,
her draggled pomaded hair showed colourless as her haggard face;
she no longer looked a young woman.</p>

<p>"Give the signal, Cousin Dorothy," added Lord Massingham.</p>

<p>She clasped her interlocked hands across her straining
heart.</p>

<p>"Fire!" she said.</p>

<p>The table was not more than three feet across.</p>

<p>"Murder, murder!" mumbled Atkinson, cringing away in the
corner with his hands to his ears.</p>

<p>One shot only broke the stillness of the great house; the
Earl, with his fingers still on the trigger, fell forward,
clutched at the table, swept the glasses to the ground with his
cuff, and dropped to the floor.</p>

<p>He lay on his back, twisting.</p>

<p>Cripplegate laughed; he made no attempt to go to his brother,
but stared at his smoking pistol as Lady Dorothy sped round the
table to the dying man. She went on her knees beside him swiftly,
as if expecting him to speak, but he turned over on his face
without any word, only a little half-fetched groan, and presently
lay dead.</p>

<p>Seeing him still she rose as swiftly as she had sunk to her
knees, only first drawing the pistol from my lord's slack
fingers. She was alone indeed, now, the one being to whom she
could have looked for protection was gone; she was in the power
of a merciless villain who had twice triumphed in this night of
horror.</p>

<p>She glanced at the evil face of Cripplegate.</p>

<p>"Do you regret my lord?" sneered he.</p>

<p>Before either of the men could cry out she had raised her
frail hand and emptied the second pistol into the bosom of the
younger brother.</p>

<p>Atkinson sprang forward and seized her, but it was too late;
as the smoke cleared Cripplegate was revealed prone between the
table and the hearth.</p>

<p>"What have you done?" chattered the wretched mock parson, bent
with terror and dragging at her rich skirts.</p>

<p>Lady Dorothy turned on him terrible eyes from which the light
of reason had for ever disappeared.</p>

<p>"Take up your book," she said. "You'll not want the marriage
service, but the prayers for the dead and damned. As for me, call
the gilt sedan chair. I will go home..."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">ON a May evening in the year 1785, when Vauxhall
Gardens had come to be accepted as the most fashionable place of
resort in London, having completely eclipsed Ranelagh, a little
scene took place in one of the alleys of the Gardens which was
the beginning of this story of crime.</p>

<p>In a summer-house surrounded with plants of laurel and box,
and away from the places of entertainment, dancing, and music, a
man and a woman were engaged in a conversation out of place with
their frivolous surroundings. She was bitterly frightened and he
was bitterly angry, and both were in the grip of a passion not
conquered but subdued, that caused them to be almost beside
themselves despite their forced calm.</p>

<p>They had purposely chosen a spot far from any lanterns or
illumination, but the moonlight was strong on the white
summer-house, and fell in through the narrow window on to the two
who stood within facing each other.</p>

<p>The woman in her agitation and distress was leaning against
the wall, holding in both hands her velvet mask. Her type was
delicate, and she looked tired if not ill; the graces of her
extreme youth were concealed by paint, powder, pomade, and an
over-gorgeous dress, for she was arrayed in the extreme of an
artificial fashion. Her tight bodice and full, hooped skirt of
gold and claret-coloured striped silk were adorned with frills
and furbelows of gold lace, her blue velvet mantle was lined with
costly black fur, and hung in great folds that made her
slenderness appear fantastic by contrast. The hood had fallen
back from curls elaborately dressed and twisted with a gold gauze
scarf, the front was unclasped on a white bosom where diamonds
showed amid lace and ribbons. All this splendour appeared but
piteous in contrast with her haggard, unhappy youthfulness.</p>

<p>The man stood more in the shade, a fine young figure, precise
in a soldier's uniform, with stiff side-curls and a sullen
face.</p>

<p>"So this is what love ends in," said the girl, moistening her
dry, rouged lips.</p>

<p>"You admit then that it was love?" he asked bitterly.</p>

<p>"You said so," she replied dully. "You said you would
live&mdash;die&mdash;suffer for me&mdash;and yet you cannot show
ordinary kindness."</p>

<p>"You," he returned fiercely, "said you would be faithful."</p>

<p>She moved her head against the wall in speechless distress;
she was sick with trying to explain&mdash;to put into words the
desperate emotions that controlled her actions.</p>

<p>The man gave a short laugh, suddenly contemptuous of the whole
situation.</p>

<p>"Faithful!" he echoed. "I suppose women do not know what the
thing is!"</p>

<p>She was tortured into a reply.</p>

<p>"Perhaps men do not know what it is to be afraid. I do not
think they can, or they would not be so cruel."</p>

<p>He moved to the door, suddenly as weary as she of the terrible
discussion in which the happiness of both was going to stormy
wreck. But the thing that she was fighting for had not been
achieved, and she urged herself in her desperation to fresh
strength, as she flung herself before him, clutching at the
lapels of his coat.</p>

<p>"You have not given me my letters," she stammered. He flushed
with a sense of shame for her, for this anxiety of hers for her
own safety seemed to him a terrible baseness; he was entirely
convinced that he had never been her lover, but only her fool,
and that caprice, not passion, had moved her in the past; her
prudence, as he thought it, appeared to him an ugly thing.</p>

<p>"I brought you the letters to return them to you," he said
grimly, "but I have changed my mind now I see your humour,
madam&mdash;you have not been so kind to me that I should forbear
being cruel to you."</p>

<p>He loosened her hands roughly and pushed her away from him;
she caught at the door and still stood facing him, her great hoop
barring his path.</p>

<p>They were both in the full moonlight now, conspicuous against
the white summer-house, which stood in tolerable imitation of a
classic temple against the dark, still laurels. They were now
forgetful of anything save each other, they did not seek to hush
their voices, nor did they perceive a man coming along the
shadowed alley towards them. He, however, saw them, recognized
the blue mantle and striped gown, heard the voices raised in
accents of anger and fear and stepped quickly into the
bushes.</p>

<p>Under the cover of the thick leaves he moved quickly and
quietly towards the summer-house; he used the skill of one not
unused to furtive, secret work, and was soon in safe ambush
behind the close laurel, from which he could observe the
distracted young creatures and hear their agonized accents.</p>

<p>"Oh, Robert," gasped the girl, "you know I must return, or I
shall be missed."</p>

<p>"Why, go!" he said, "I do not keep you."</p>

<p>"My letters."</p>

<p>"Are they not safe with me?"</p>

<p>"But if they should fall into the hands of another&mdash;will
you not understand the ruin it would be for me?"</p>

<p>"I understand," he replied, "but too well. I admire your great
prudence."</p>

<p>"For God's sake do not talk so bitterly! You know how I am
placed amid it all. I wish I were dead."</p>

<p>He answered with dreadful coldness.</p>

<p>"Indeed, madam, you had better be dead if you have not the
courage to live."</p>

<p>So saying, he put her from him resolutely and in a manner that
she could not resist, and turning away, left her on the moonlit
steps.</p>

<p>The watcher noted his regimentals, his bearing, his face, with
a keen and practised eye, then turned his keen gaze on the
wretched girl, who was making a fierce effort to control and
contain her passion. The fear that had driven her to this secret
interview now nerved her to escape from her present situation;
she went back into the summer-house for her mask and pulled her
hood over her face.</p>

<p>As she was flying away with trembling steps she found the
new-comer, who had come now from behind the bushes, directly in
her path.</p>

<p>So unlooked for was this that she almost stumbled into his
arms and could not repress a cry of utter dismay. He, cool and
easy, took off his hat and showed in the moonlight a fine and
cynical face.</p>

<p>She knew him instantly for M. le Duc de Rohault, the French
Ambassador, and he had known her, from the moment he had first
heard her voice, for Lady Arabella Ware, the daughter of the man
who was the foremost statesman in the English Ministry.</p>

<p>With an effort that he could not but admire, the girl
commanded herself.</p>

<p>"Sir, you are in time to take me back to my party. I vow I
shall be missed. I came but a few steps down an alley with Lady
Sylvia Tremaine."</p>

<p>She stopped short, conscious that her explanation, forced and
hurried, was but a betrayal.</p>

<p>"And lost your way," finished the Frenchman suavely. "It is so
easy, mademoiselle&mdash;permit me to escort you back to madame
the Duchess, your mother, before the <i>fte</i> completely loses
its brightness from your absence."</p>

<p>She was staring at him with eyes more full of terror than she
knew; his artificial gallantry contrasted bitterly with the crude
words that Captain Robert Tame had just spoken to her. M. de
Rohault was a man almost old enough to be her father, charming,
witty, polished, lively&mdash;it did not seem possible that even
if she were in his power he would betray her. Yet she no longer
felt secure of any man's chivalry.</p>

<p>As she stepped again among her own people she felt, strangely,
a throb of relief, as if the interview in the lonely summer-house
belonged to some evil dream which could now be forgotten, and she
looked at the great Earl who was to be her husband with a sense
of protection even in his mere serene presence.</p>

<p>She would not have enjoyed even this passing relief from her
trouble if she could have seen the further actions of M. de
Rohault. As soon as he had left her he sought for his secretary,
M. de Nivelle, and asked him if they had many lackeys present. He
seldom went anywhere without being unobtrusively accompanied by
reliable men from the Embassy, and to-night there were four
waiting by the gates for the departure of His Excellency.</p>

<p>M. de Rohault dispatched the secretary to fetch these, and
drawing him apart from the company, gave him his instructions in
a quick low tone.</p>

<p>An hour later Captain Robert Tarne was walking away from the
Gardens in a mood that reeked not of earth nor sky. His love, his
pride, his dignity, his very manhood had been struck at most
cruelly. For a year he had indulged the dream that he, the poor
soldier, would win openly, as he had won secretly, the great
man's daughter. She had fostered this delusion by her passionate
letters, her oft-repeated vows&mdash;all the bitter sweetness of
their stolen meetings. And he had been confident with the supreme
confidence of youth&mdash;the world was before him, why should he
not achieve everything? She had but to wait. Then had come the
rude awakening; the girl was betrothed under his eyes to one of
the greatest names in the land&mdash;a man of such repute and
position that Robert Tame felt himself a boy, a fool in
comparison.</p>

<p>Yet, all the more because of this, he hotly pressed his claim
on the terrified girl who had so repeatedly sworn fidelity to
him, only to find that she was not capable of sacrificing
anything for him, and that her sole thought was to hush up her
rash love-affair&mdash;and to obtain the return of her
letters.</p>

<p>Her last frantic appeal had moved him to accede to her
request, and he had promised to bring these poor mementoes of
their unhappy love to Vauxhall and there to return them to her;
but when he had seen her in her splendour, when he saw his rival
magnificent in his unconscious triumph, when he considered his
own sincere love and genuine trust, the unhappy young man could
not rise to any generosity.</p>

<p>Now, as he walked along the fresh country road, surrounded by
the fragrant dark of the May night, this packet of letters seemed
like a weight of fire in the pocket above his heart. She should
not have them back to turn over and perhaps laugh at, to profane
with hasty destruction (he now saw her as wholly evil), neither
would he keep them to torture himself with&mdash;he would weight
them and sink them in the river and let the swift running waters
of the Thames obliterate the words of false love.</p>

<p>So absorbed was he in these gloomy reflections that it was
with utter surprise that he felt a firm hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Turning swiftly he found a group of men behind him, who had
come up noiselessly out of the dark. He saw at once that they had
some sinister intent and took them for footpads.</p>

<p>"Fellows," he said, "I have nothing of any value&mdash;you may
take my watch and buckles if you will let me go at once. I am in
no humour to be delayed."</p>

<p>"Nor am I," replied the man who had him by the arm, "but when
you say you have nothing of an value, you are mistaken&mdash;you
have now in your pocket, sir, something very valuable
indeed."</p>

<p>At this voice, so cultured and cool, speaking English with a
slight foreign accent, Captain Tarne became uncomfortable, for he
saw that he was in the hands of no ordinary highwayman. He made
an angry movement, but one of the other strangers instantly
seized his free arm, and the two held him helpless in a powerful
grip. They were all cloaked and masked, and it was impossible to
guess at their quality.</p>

<p>"Something," continued the spokesman, "very valuable to the
peace of a noble lady, my dear sir."</p>

<p>Robert Tame started, set his teeth, and listened in fierce
silence.</p>

<p>"Please give me those letters," added his captor.</p>

<p>"Who sent you?" demanded Captain Tarne roughly.</p>

<p>It was the most intolerable of all his intolerable thoughts
that she should have told someone her story, and set another man
to gain from him by force what he had refused to her
entreaties.</p>

<p>He groaned in his rage and struggled fiercely with his
captors.</p>

<p>It was but a useless display of passion. They held him
securely pinioned, and, being six against one, it took them but a
little while to render him powerless and effect their purpose,
which was easily done by a quick search through his pockets.</p>

<p>Having found the piteous packet, which was tied by a cherished
black ribbon that had at one time been worn round the neck of the
writer of them, they set free the struggling and despairing young
man, and disappeared as silently and as swiftly as they had
come.</p>

<p>Lady Arabella Ware was enlightened as to the terrible position
in which she stood, when M. de Rohault called at her father's
mansion in St. James's Square and requested to see her alone.</p>

<p>She came into the great, ornate drawing-room looking so ill,
so young, and so different from what she had done a few days
previously at Vauxhall, that the cold Frenchman was almost moved
to pity for his victim.</p>

<p>She wore a white muslin dress, plain and even untidy, her
fair, but not bright hair was free of powder and hung like a
child's about her slender shoulders. She looked sullen and so
without charm that M. de Rohault wondered how the parents had
secured her so magnificent a match; she was certainly a great
heiress, but the Earl was so wealthy as to be indifferent to
pecuniary advantages.</p>

<p>No ornaments relieved her careless attire; a small spaniel was
fastened to her waist by a broad blue ribbon; she seated herself
and the dog jumped on to her knee; she kept her glance on the
ground, and her small, nervous hands closed over the dog.</p>

<p>"I am in a position to do you a service," began M. de
Rohault&mdash;"a very considerable service, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>She did not answer nor look up.</p>

<p>"And you," continued the cool, pleasant voice, "are in a
position to do me a considerable service."</p>

<p>Now she gave a furtive look at the handsome man with his rich
appointments who leaned so easily against the chimney-piece and
so completely dominated the situation.</p>

<p>"You have been very foolish, mademoiselle," said M. de
Rohault; "if your folly were known it would be more than death
for you."</p>

<p>"You were spying then in Vauxhall," she muttered sullenly.</p>

<p>He shrugged his elegant shoulders.</p>

<p>"I know what passed between you and Captain Tarne."</p>

<p>She glanced at him with vivid hate in her childish eyes.</p>

<p>"What is that to you?" she demanded roughly.</p>

<p>He laughed effectively.</p>

<p>"The Earl is my very good friend&mdash;why should I allow him
to marry you&mdash;on false pretences?"</p>

<p>She blazed at that.</p>

<p>"There was never any wrong in what I did, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Could you prove that?"</p>

<p>The wretched girl was silent.</p>

<p>"Is your lover so chivalrous that you can trust to him,
mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>Her hands pressed so tightly on the dog on her lap that the
little animal turned and whined up at her.</p>

<p>"I have no longer faith in the chivalry of any man," she
answered heavily.</p>

<p>Her glance roved from side to side, and she bit her lower lip;
he, well used to read human kind, was more alarmed by this
restraint of hers than he would have been for the outburst he had
expected. He wished to reassure her, and spoke softly and with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Understand that I would not frighten you&mdash;I did not come
for that."</p>

<p>She interrupted him.</p>

<p>"You have a price to put upon your silence, my lord," she said
then, with a pride that he had not looked for in her. "Tell me
what it is, and let us end a scene so shameful to both of
us."</p>

<p>M. de Rohault was angered into cold harshness again.</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;your father has papers which are of
importance to France. I know where they are&mdash;in the
left-hand drawer of the ebony bureau in his cabinet. You must
get these for me."</p>

<p>She stared at him stupidly.</p>

<p>"You could easily do this, mademoiselle; you could get the
keys from your father or his secretary, you could enter the
cabinet without suspicion."</p>

<p>"I'm to betray my father and my country?" she muttered.</p>

<p>"There is no need for heroics, mademoiselle," he said sharply.
He proceeded to tell her the size and shape of the packet, the
number of seals upon it, and what these were.</p>

<p>"It would be missed at once," she said dully.</p>

<p>"No, because I should return it to you immediately. I only
want to take a copy."</p>

<p>"I will not do it," replied the girl stubbornly and fiercely.
Her distorted face flamed with rage and bitter loathing. "Why
should I be afraid? It is but your word against mine, and I know
the Earl is of too noble a mind to listen to one who wantonly
defames a woman."</p>

<p>"If you are in this humour," replied M. de Rohault, "I must
tell you that I have proofs."</p>

<p>And from the bosom of his waistcoat he took out the parcel of
letters that he had robbed from Captain Tarne and held them out
towards her; at the sight of this object, which had lately been
the cause of her unceasing uneasiness and torment, in the hands
of the man who had just proved himself her ruthless enemy, a
convulsion shook her thin body; she covered her face with her
hands and some strangled words died in her throat.</p>

<p>The most cruel of her emotions was the wrath against the man
she had loved, for she made no doubt that Robert Tarne had,
animated by a spirit of revenge against her for her infidelity,
taken this vile means to torture and humiliate the creature whom
he had once vowed he would give his life to please.</p>

<p>The keen voice of M. de Rohault broke in on her desparate
reflections; the sound of it was like the note of doom on her
distracted heart.</p>

<p>"I can give you two days, mademoiselle, no more."</p>

<p>With that, and a bow of freezing coldness, he left her, a prey
to the most utter terror, bewilderment, and remorse.</p>

<p>Lady Arabella had neither experience nor friend to turn to in
her extremity. She was a stranger, both to her parents and to the
man to whom she was betrothed. A childhood of cold splendour had
enclosed her soul within itself, no one had ever troubled to
understand her or in any way to invite her confidence; she
regarded those who were her masters with awe, with respect, with
fear, not with trust or tenderness.</p>

<p>As the discovery of her pitiful, harmless, childish
love-affair seemed to her to spell a woe worse than damnation, so
the theft of her father's papers appeared to her as a crime
without parallel. She foresaw unheard of disasters befalling her
house and her nation through this possible action of hers, and
her lack of knowledge of the world of politics made her
overcharge with horror the likely consequences of her compliance
with M. de Rohault's request.</p>

<p>She hurried up to her room, the little dog attached to her
waist trotting by her side, and she flung herself on her great
bed with her arms clasped round the spaniel, who seemed to her
the only creature that loved her or had the least interest in her
fate.</p>

<p>Her being was absorbed by one terrible idea: she was morally
and physically incapable of getting M. de Rohault his papers, and
he would expose her to her parents and the Earl.</p>

<p>She could not rise again that day; towards evening she fell
into slight convulsions, followed by an excess of fever. During
the night she was so ill that her governess and her maids would
have sent for assistance, but it was not the custom to disturb
the Duchess for any but the most serious matters, and as their
mistress forbade them to leave her and appeared to make an effort
for strength and calm, they forbode a duty that might have proved
harmful for themselves.</p>

<p>Towards the dawn this unhappy creature did indeed regain some
tranquillity, but it was the quiet of a fixed and terrible
purpose conceived by a feeble brain tormented to the point of
insanity. Feigning to have completely recovered her strength and
spirit she found some excuse for sending her women out of the
room and evading the vigilance of her governess, and, once alone,
secured about her person a paper of arsenic that was kept in the
drawer of her dressing-table for making washes for whitening the
skin.</p>

<p>She knew of the deadly properties of this drug, for the
fashionable world was yet talking of the famous young beauty who
had lately died from too great a use of this same complexion
paint. Her only doubt was if the quantity in her possession was
sufficient to effect her purpose.</p>

<p>That day no one observed anything unusual in her behaviour, no
one suspected the alternate shiverings and burnings of fever that
coursed through her blood, no one noticed her dry lips, her
blazing eyes, the lightheadedness of her empty laugh, for she was
of no especial object of interest to any; nothing remarkable was
expected from her, and she was accepted as the very ordinary
creature that she had always appeared to be.</p>

<p>At a big reception given that evening at her father's house in
honour of her approaching marriage, she seemed as happy as her
good fortune entitled her to be; most of the women envied her;
she seemed so young, so wealthy, so placed above all hurt. The
eclat of her great match lent a charm to her presence, she moved
about her father's noble rooms the belle of the evening, followed
by admiring and jealous glances.</p>

<p>M. de Rohault was present and found occasion to speak to her
amid the gay press.</p>

<p>"Have you the papers, mademoiselle?" he asked.</p>

<p>He had stopped her in a half-curtained alcove set with
card-tables; she retreated into this and stood against one of the
gilt mirrors.</p>

<p>She was again powdered, pomaded, patched, attired in pale
rose-coloured silk and white gauze, wreaths of artificial flowers
all over her hoop, and pearls round her neck; the paint that was
such an outrage to her youth could not disguise the fever that
showed on her lips and cheeks and in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, I will get the papers," she answered hastily. She began
to laugh, and pressed her handkerchief to her mouth.</p>

<p>M. de Rohault was vexed that his victim had not yet begun to
put in motion the execution of his wishes. The matter was really
important to him; the possession of the documents in question
would enable him to perform a signal service to his country and
to establish himself for ever as a skilful diplomat. He had long
been crossing wits with the statesman who was this girl's father,
and it had cost him infinite patience and skill even to discover
the whereabouts of these papers.</p>

<p>Lady Arabella ceased laughing.</p>

<p>"I will do what you wish," she said in a dead tone.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," he returned, eyeing her keenly. "I shall want
them to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Or&mdash;" she muttered, eyeing him furtively.</p>

<p>"Or the Earl and your father shall know everything," he
finished her broken sentence. She moistened her lips and sat
down. And rose up again, fumbling at her bosom.</p>

<p>"I will certainly get those papers for you, sir," she said in
a thick voice, and speaking very fast, "so let us be good
friends, eh?"</p>

<p>He was pleased that she showed such sense, for he had been
prepared for a scene; he bowed over the hand she offered.</p>

<p>"I have been foolish," she continued in a voice now perfectly
controlled, "and you have been skilful&mdash;well, I must accept
the situation."</p>

<p>She paused, looked round, and then added:</p>

<p>"I wish to discuss with you how we shall meet
tomorrow&mdash;it will be difficult, as I am engaged all
day&mdash;fetch some coffee, sir, that it may seem we talk
naturally."</p>

<p>M. de Rohault admired the good sense of his accomplice. He
left her a moment to tell a page to bring refreshments into the
alcove; when he returned she was playing with a paper of comfits
that she held on her rose-wreathed lap.</p>

<p>She offered him one on the palm of her hand.</p>

<p>"The Earl's gift," she smiled.</p>

<p>He took and ate the sweetmeat; she gave him another; when the
coffee was brought she sent him after the page to ask for some
Baples cake and, while his back was turned, she put two more of
the comfits in his cup.</p>

<p>Handsome and stately in his velvets and diamonds, with his
graceful manner of courts and his cold air of power, the man at
whose mercy she lay leant towards her with the air of a friend,
and discussed the details of their meeting on the morrow.</p>

<p>The girl was not listening to what he said; her glance was on
the fragile little cup he held; her features became rigid, and
her eyes glazed with an intense horror.</p>

<p>"You are paying no attention, mademoiselle," said M. de
Rohault at length.</p>

<p>He had now finished his coffee, and set the cup down on the
card-table.</p>

<p>"I do not feel well," mumbled the Lady Arabella.</p>

<p>Her appearance was ghastly and indeed alarmed him. She rose,
swaying in her hoop. He sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Keep your wits, girl," he commanded, gripping her arm.</p>

<p>She stared at him.</p>

<p>"Keep my wits," she repeated. "Yes, but my head hurts me. I
will go to my room."</p>

<p>M. de Rohault was deeply angered.</p>

<p>"You will not," he said, "in this way escape the obligations
that you are under to me."</p>

<p>She gave him a look full of an apprehension and terror that
almost amounted to the stare of insanity.</p>

<p>With some incoherent words she escaped from his presence and
staggered into the splendid ballroom, only to fall with an
hysterical cry at the feet of her betrothed husband as he came to
lead her out for the gavotte.</p>

<p>The <i>fte</i> was broken up, and she was carried unconscious
to her chamber.</p>

<p>That night she fell into convulsions so terrible and so
frequent that her life was despaired of; in the morning London
rang with the news of the death of the French ambassador, who had
fallen on the threshold of his chamber, and in a short time
succumbed to a swift agony that his doctors declared must be due
to poison.</p>

<p>The uncontrolled ravings of the unhappy Lady Arabella and the
discovery among the dead man's papers of her foolish love-letters
soon threw a tragic light on the author and motive of this
useless crime.</p>

<p>The betrothal was hastily broken off, the scandal hushed up by
the great ones of the land, whom it so nearly concerned, and the
wretched girl, who had planned a crime that she had not the
strength to profit by, was hurried into obscurity in the
country.</p>

<p>Her life, but not her reason, survived her dreadful illness;
she never remembered her guilt nor those circumstances which had
been the cause of it, but became a fond, witless creature, gentle
and harmless, but with a blank mind and childish ways.</p>

<p>Now that she was insane, sick, and utterly disgraced, her
parents were glad to cover her miserable existence by any
marriage they could find, and accepted the sole offer that came
for the once courted heiress&mdash;that of Captain Robert
Tarne.</p>

<p>She knew him, and displayed the only joy she ever manifested
when in his presence; he took her abroad, and it was said that
this extraordinary marriage was more than commonly happy, and
that the man, who felt himself guilty of the act that had first
caused the tragedy, found a secret atonement in the care of a
fair, loving creaure as gentle and innocent as a child.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>BRENT'S FOLLY</h2>

<h3>Reprinted in:<br>
<i>Twilight and Other Supernatural Romances by Marjorie Bowen</i>, Ash-Tree Press, 1998<br>

<br>

<p class="first">THEY said each Brent had his folly, a horse, a
woman, a building, an idea, but the present Brent outshone his
ancestors by the blatant coarseness of his particular
caprice.</p>

<p>When his father had seriously encumbered the estates to build
on another wing with a massive ballroom that accorded ill with
the Tudor Manor house, the county had remarked that the historic
folly of the Brents had passed the limits of the picturesque and
romantic and become very like stupidity.</p>

<p>The next Brent, however, excelled the foolish action of his
father, for his folly took the form of flesh and blood; to make a
mistake about a woman, said the county, was worse than to make a
mistake about a building, though there were some cynics who
declared that the latter error was worse because the woman passed
with her generation and was easily forgotten, whereas the stone
and brick remained a lasting annoyance till someone had the
courage, time, and money to remove it.</p>

<p>But while she was there, certainly the woman was the greater
cause for marvel, the greater shame to the good taste and
intelligence of the Brents.</p>

<p>If she had been outrageous, impossible, an actress, a
foreigner, a milkmaid, it might have been a folly forgiven and
even admired.</p>

<p>If she had been ugly and very rich, or beautiful and very
poor, it would have been a thing condoned&mdash;an action with at
least a motive, some reason to explain the extravagance, the
departure from the usual which was more or less expected of the
Brents.</p>

<p>But here there was nothing of wonderful, nothing of romantic&mdash;
nothing to make people startle and stare.</p>

<p>She was the younger daughter of a dull, middle-class family of
correct education and morals, neither plain nor pretty, with bad
health and a lethargic temperament, and most dismal dull in
company.</p>

<p>She excelled in nothing, her taste was of the worst, she could
not manage her servants nor her acquaintances, she was jealous
and sullen and entirely indifferent to all that makes the fire
and colour of life.</p>

<p>And she was five years older than her husband, and after many
years of marriage was still childless.</p>

<p>And this was the folly of the last Brent, Sir Roger, handsome,
accomplished, brilliant, wealthy.</p>

<p>People asked each other what hidden motive had induced him to
offer all to this woman who could not even appreciate what he
gave.</p>

<p>Of all the follies of the Brents this was the most
inexplicable.</p>

<p>If she had been only wicked, the thing might have been
understood, if she had shown the least sign of any of the arts
and graces of an enchantress he would have stood excused.</p>

<p>But she was neutral, she was nothing, she had not a single
charm that would have induced an ordinary man to choose her for
the love of a season, and instead Roger Brent had chosen her for
his wife&mdash;this was what was neither understood nor forgiven.</p>

<p>The county disapproved and showed its disapproval; Sir Roger
lost many friends; he became a gloomy self-absorbed man,
withdrawn slightly from his fellows.</p>

<p>He rarely left Brent Manor; he was a good landlord, a good
neighbour, a fine figure among the country gentry&mdash;if it had not
been for his marriage.</p>

<p>But that had ruined all; Sir Roger at forty was considered as
a man with no longer any possibilities before him; he would live
and die the squire of Brent Manor, nothing more.</p>

<p>For, like damp ashes on fire, his wife seemed to have choked
and stifled all that was eager, ambitious and ardent in Sir
Roger; he had sacrificed to this nullity all that a man could
sacrifice to beauty and worth.</p>

<p>When Charles Denton, who had known and envied Sir Roger in the
days of their common youth, returned to England from Spain, where
he had been fulfilling honourable and profitable duties for His
Majesty's Government, he heard from several the story of the
folly of the last of the Brents.</p>

<p>The last of the Brents and the last of the follies it
appeared, since there was no one of the name to carry on the
family and the family traditions.</p>

<p>Denton was sorry; he had almost loved Sir Roger, they had been
constantly together until Denton's foreign appointment had
separated them.</p>

<p>He wrote to Sir Roger and asked if he might spend some of his
leave at Brent Manor; Sir Roger responded cordially, and Denton
went down to Brent with a little ache of regret at his heart for
the fate of his friend.</p>

<p>He found him as much changed as the reports in London had led
him to believe he would be, and despite his preparation he was
shocked, almost startled.</p>

<p>Sir Roger, for whom 'brilliant' had always seemed the most
fitting epithet, had become almost dull; he was silent, almost
shy, even with the old friend whom he had seemed so glad to
welcome.</p>

<p>His clothes were of an ancient pattern, he was listless in his
manner, the unpowdered hair was plentifully sprinkled with grey,
the handsome face hard and lined.</p>

<p>The Manor house, too, seemed ill-kept and gloomy.</p>

<p>Denton had an impression of gloom from all his
surroundings.</p>

<p>At supper he saw the lady of the house. She was neatly dressed
in a gay sacque; her manner was dull and civil.</p>

<p>Denton eyed her in vain for a single merit; her figure was
ill-shaped and slightly stooping, her hands and feet were large,
her complexion was of an ugly pallor, her features soft and
heavy, eyes and hair of a colourless brown, her movements without
meaning, her words without grace.</p>

<p>Denton inwardly sighed and the supper hour passed heavily.</p>

<p>She left them early and Denton, spurred by a deep impulse,
turned swiftly to his host and asked:</p>

<p>'Why did you marry her?'</p>

<p>Sir Roger was sitting in a dejected attitude with his head a
little lowered.</p>

<p>As his friend spoke he looked up, and a smile touched his
sombre features.</p>

<p>'You are the first who has had the courage to demand that
question,' he responded.</p>

<p>'Or the bad taste,' apologized Denton.</p>

<p>Sir Roger shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'The others were silent and stayed away, you speak and come,'
he said.</p>

<p>Denton was indignant for his friend.</p>

<p>'Why should they stay away? The lady is well enough.'</p>

<p>'She blights,' said Sir Roger decisively.</p>

<p>Denton wondered that such a mediocrity should have that
power&mdash;but it was what he had heard in London.</p>

<p>'A woman,' he replied, 'can keep in a woman's place&mdash;why
should she interfere with your friends?'</p>

<p>Sir Roger smiled again.</p>

<p>'She is so dull, she deadens, so stupid she frightens, so
unlovely she depresses.'</p>

<p>'And yet you married her!'</p>

<p>'Yes, I married her.'</p>

<p>'Why, Roger, why?'</p>

<p>'You wonder?'</p>

<p>'Who would not wonder, you who had everything, might have
married a Princess, you might have had the best of life&mdash;instead&mdash;'</p>

<p>'This!' finished Sir Roger.</p>

<p>'There must be a reason.'</p>

<p>'You think so?'</p>

<p>'Assuredly.'</p>

<p>'Would you like to hear it?'</p>

<p>'Certainly&mdash;I came here to hear it,' smiled Denton.</p>

<p>Sir Roger for a while was silent; he was turning over the
incidents of his past as one turns the leaves of a long closed
book, with wonder and a little sadness at ancient things that
once meant so much and now mean so little.</p>

<p>'Is it worth while?' he asked at length.</p>

<p>He rested his elbows on the table and looked rather drearily
at his friend.</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'To tell you&mdash;to tell anyone how it happened,' replied Sir
Roger.</p>

<p>Denton looked with profound compassion at his lined face, his
bowed figure, his gray sprinkled hair, his careless dress.</p>

<p>And Brent looked with a dull envy at the neat elegance of his
friend, who, powdered, fashionable, alert, seemed indeed to come
from another world than that duty circle which comprised the life
of Brent Manor.</p>

<p>'Tell me,' said Denton quietly.</p>

<p>Sir Roger laughed.</p>

<p>'Tell you why I married Lily Walters?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>Sir Roger shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'Why not?' he answered.</p>

<p>He turned his eyes, still handsome but lustreless, towards the
log fire which flickered in the sculptured chimney place, and his
fine hands dropped and clasped slackly on the dark surface of the
sombre oak table, where stood the glasses and the fruit and the
bottles of old wine.</p>

<p>Then, like one who reads aloud slowly, and with a certain
difficulty, he began his strange relation.</p>

<p>'I greatly loved my life. I had everything to make existence
pleasant. Health, name, money&mdash;wits&mdash;you know what I had, my
friend.'</p>

<p>'Everything.'</p>

<p>'Everything. But I wished for more. I had a lust for
knowledge, for power, for experience&mdash;I wished to reach the
limits of every sensation.</p>

<p>'For me there was no wine powerful enough, no woman beautiful
enough, no gold bright enough&mdash;</p>

<p>'I wished to prove everything&mdash;to see everything&mdash;to know everything.</p>

<p>'For five years I travelled from one country to another; I had
enough money to obtain all my desires.</p>

<p>'I had friends, lovers, horses, houses, ships, I travelled
sometimes in a coach and six, sometimes on foot, sometimes I
lodged in palaces, sometimes I slept in a ditch. I kissed
princesses by the light of a hundred candles, and peasant girls
by the dewy light of dawn, I stayed at the most dissolute courts
in Italy, and I shut myself for months in the austerity of a
Spanish convent.</p>

<p>'I experienced poverty, luxury, every day I gained
knowledge.</p>

<p>'I practised in music, poetry, botany, medicine, painting,
sculpture, astronomy&mdash;I sat at the feet of wise men and drew
crude knowledge from the unlettered of all countries.</p>

<p>'Still I was not satisfied.</p>

<p>'My health remained vigorous and my mind restless.</p>

<p>'So far I had not found one woman whom I could not replace,
one friend whose company was a necessity, one art or science to
which I wished to devote my life.</p>

<p>'Then at The Hague I met a certain Doctor Strass, and under
his guidance I began to seriously study alchemy and
occultism.</p>

<p>'In this I found at last something that absorbed my whole
being.</p>

<p>'Here was the love, the passion that should absorb my
life.</p>

<p>'For three years I lived for nothing else. I resolved to find
the elixir of life.'</p>

<p>Denton moved back out of the candlelight, so that he might
more clearly see his friend's face, but Sir Roger was absolutely
grave.</p>

<p>He spoke as a man who, with quiet deliberation, relates sober
sense.</p>

<p>'The elixir of life,' he repeated. 'The magic powder that
should confer on me eternal youth and eternal enjoyment.'</p>

<p>'A strange whim,' said Denton quietly. 'You who had
everything.'</p>

<p>'I wished to keep everything,' responded Sir Roger, 'but more
than that even, I wished for power.'</p>

<p>'The last temptation of the Devil!' smiled his friend.</p>

<p>'I wished for power,' repeated Brent, 'but I cannot explain.
Enough that the thing took hold of me.</p>

<p>'I lived for that alone. Occult studies absorbed my time and
largely my fortune and my health.</p>

<p>'I seemed ever on the verge of a discovery; but I attained
nothing.'</p>

<p>He paused, and a bitter sadness darkened his sensitive
face.</p>

<p>'Nothing,' he repeated. 'I but underlined the failures of
others, but repeated once more the tale of delusion and
disappointment.</p>

<p>'But in this I had more strength than some, in that I resolved
to cease the fruitless and perilous study that had fascinated my
entire soul.</p>

<p>'I determined to free myself from what was becoming an
incubus.</p>

<p>'I was frightened by the fate of others whom I saw as half
mad, half idiotic old men fumbling with their philtres and
muttering over their furnaces; in short, I vowed to free myself
from what I at last saw as but a net or device of the devil to
draw me away from a useful and enjoyable life.</p>

<p>'With this resolve strong within me I returned to England, and
my desire for the normal desires of my former life was increased
by the sight of familiar faces and sights.</p>

<p>'I made up my mind to enter politics, and was on the point of
taking steps in this direction, when an event occurred which
again altered everything.'</p>

<p>He paused and pressed the palms of his hands to his brows.
Denton was regarding him curiously.</p>

<p>'One day a sober-looking person came to see me. He seemed a
doctor or a lawyer of the better sort.</p>

<p>'He was not English; I took him to be a Dutchman or of the Low
German nationality&mdash;he was habited very neatly and very precise
in his speech.</p>

<p>'"I hear," said he without preamble, "that you have studied
alchemy."</p>

<p>'"For a while," said I, "but I have left that business."</p>

<p>'Whereat he smiled quietly and drew from his pocket a little
box of tortoiseshell like a gentleman's box for snuff, and
opening it, he drew out, wrapped in two foldings of scarlet silk,
a piece of stone the size of a walnut and the colour of amber.
"This is what you have been looking for," he said calmly; "this
is what the vulgar called the Philosopher's Stone."</p>

<p>'At these words all the blood went back on my heart, and I
begged for a portion with tears in my eyes.</p>

<p>'Whereupon he very comfortably took off a paring with his
nail, for the stone was soft like soap, and laid it in the palm
of my hand.</p>

<p>'And while I was yet too amazed to speak he left me.</p>

<p>'I had yet with me my retorts and crucibles, and that night I
very eagerly tested the portion of the stone on a piece of lead,
and when in the morning I poured it forth it was pure rich gold.
When this was set I took it round to the jeweller who worked for
the court, and asked him what it was, and he told me that it was
indeed gold of a finer quality than he had ever handled
before.</p>

<p>'I was like a madman, for I had no means of finding my
stranger, but that day he came again, and without preamble asked
me if I was satisfied, and what I would do to possess the secret
which, he declared, had become indifferent to him, as he had
passed on to higher studies.</p>

<p>'And he told me about the wonders of this stone, how a few
drops of it dissolved in water, if allowed to stand, would leave
great rubies and pearls at the bottom, and if taken would confer
youth and beauty on him who drank.</p>

<p>'And presently he showed me this experiment, and we sat up all
night talking, and in the morning there were the jewels hard and
glistening in our hands.</p>

<p>'And then he propounded to me what he would have me
do&mdash;take some poor mean creature to wife, and with the
elixir make her into a goddess.'</p>

<p>Brent paused thoughtfully; Denton was still looking at him
with intent eyes.</p>

<p>Sir Roger continued:</p>

<p>'I was to marry her first, to show my trust. I was to present
her to the town, and afterwards transform her. The idea pleased
me beyond words; it was what no man had ever done before.</p>

<p>'I agreed.</p>

<p>'My stranger presented me to Lily Walters. I easily obtained
the consent of her family&mdash;in brief, I made a match that
confounded all my friends.</p>

<p>'My Dutchman was at the church, and afterwards presented me
with a packet, which he said contained the recipe for the famous
stone.</p>

<p>'Such was my impatience that I opened it in the coach ere we
had reached home.</p>

<p>'It was blank paper.</p>

<p>'I left my bride to run to the stranger's lodging, but he had
left.</p>

<p>'I never saw him again.'</p>

<p>Sir Roger ended abruptly and turned his straight gaze on his
friend's serious face.</p>

<p>'And that is why I married Lily Walters,' he concluded.</p>

<p>'And the rubies?' asked Denton, quietly.</p>

<p>'She wears them now and then, set in the gold I made with the
paring of stone.'</p>

<p>Denton was silent.</p>

<p>'I have searched Europe for that man,' continued Sir Roger
sullenly. 'I hope yet to kill him before I die.'</p>

<p>'You would be justified,' said Denton, easily. He rose and
crossed to the fire, still looking covertly and intently at his
friend.</p>

<p>Sir Roger muttered to himself a little, and presently fell
asleep with his head bowed on his heart.</p>

<p>Denton softly left the room.</p>

<p>He was startled to see Lady Brent waiting in the shadows of
the great hall.</p>

<p>'I don't think Sir Roger is very well,' said Denton,
quietly.</p>

<p>Her plain face quivered and her short-sighted eyes
narrowed.</p>

<p>'I always wait up when there is anyone here,' she said simply.
'I never know what he will do.'</p>

<p>They looked at each other.</p>

<p>'He had a strange life before I married him,' continued Lady
Brent. 'He brought me a ruby necklace, and told me it had been
made by the Philosopher's Stone.'</p>

<p>'Those studies turn a man's brain,' said Denton.</p>

<p>'Oh!' answered Lady Brent in her thin ugly voice. 'Roger has
been mad a long time; no one knows the life I lead with him.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>A QUIET WOMAN</h2>

<h3>Reprinted in <i>The 20-Story Magazine</i>, #134, August 1933</h3>

<br>

<p class="first">HE walked slowly through a day of complete and
perfect winter; the trees were bare of even the curled leaves
that had remained to them but twenty-four hours before, for a
high and bitter wind had been abroad the previous night.</p>

<p>Now it was quite still, the early afternoon was drawing to a
close, and the sun was sinking in a red haze behind the uplands
of Vyse Park.</p>

<p>Overhead the sky was colourless and chill, the landscape lay
veiled by indefinite shadows; everything had a bleak look of
greyness, the frost stiffened the road, and the water in the ruts
was filmed with ice.</p>

<p>Mathew Attenbury knew Vyse Park well, but he had never seen it
in winter.</p>

<p>Vivid, poignant memories of these roads and fields in summer
and in spring haunted his way as he approached the house.</p>

<p>Slowly and reluctantly, for his errand was terrible to
him&mdash;yet one that could not be refused. The husband of the
woman who had loved him, and who was also his own cousin and
friend, had written after a year's silence:</p>

<p>"Come and help me burn her letters; I cannot face the deed
alone."</p>

<p>This message had not roused in him any fear that their secret
had been discovered; their friendship, their relationship had
covered their love; their open fondness had disguised their
hidden passion.</p>

<p>And she had not been an ordinary woman, but a creature of
intelligence, of wit, of learning, and it had been natural for
her to move amid men who admired and, perhaps, loved her.
Attenbury could remember one who had certainly loved her&mdash;a
young man who carried a pair of colours in the Guards; a
handsome, stupid creature&mdash;they had laughed at him, quite
tenderly, together.</p>

<p>And George Vyse had never suspected anything. Attenbury was
their oldest and dearest friend, and she was the last woman
anyone would have thought of as light or deceptive, she was so
open and frank, so simple and natural&mdash;a quiet woman, for
all her brilliancy.</p>

<p>To Mathew Attenbury, for five years her lover, she appeared
wholly good; in his eyes she was not smirched in the very least
by their relationship, they belonged to each other, and their
consciences had always been at rest since they disturbed no
conventions and hurt no one.</p>

<p>Utter secrecy had kept their love undegraded and veiled it
with romance.</p>

<p>They had always been kind to George, and he had been happy in
their affection; they had become so used to him that they hardly
wished him out of the way.</p>

<p>A year ago she had died, very suddenly, in London, of the
small-pox.</p>

<p>She had been brave and gay till the end; her hair, bright and
tangled on the pillow, seemed like a joyous wreath even when her
disfigured face was blind and cold.</p>

<p>Two men at least had broken hearts for this death; Mathew
Attenbury went abroad, and wandered aimlessly through the decayed
cities of Italy; George Vyse shut himself up in his country
house, the scene of all the happy summers of his wedded life.</p>

<p>Soon after Attenbury returned he had received the summons of
his cousin.</p>

<p>He was immensely sorry for George, who had no memories such as
his own to illumine the bleak desolation of grievous loss.</p>

<p>Because of this pity he came now&mdash;and because the thing
had been asked in her name.</p>

<p>"You were her dearest friend," George Vyse had written; "there
is no one has the right to be here but you."</p>

<p>Poor George! How he loved her still!</p>

<p>Mathew Attenbury smiled from the riches of his storied
treasures of remembrances&mdash;his life could never be
completely dull or empty as long as he had these precious
recollections of the glorious love of a woman like Anne Vyse.</p>

<p>She had been so utterly his; such a comrade, such a friend,
such a lover!</p>

<p>He wondered if his cousin guessed what he had missed when he
had missed the heart of Anne.</p>

<p>As for these letters that he had been asked to help read and
destroy or preserve, he knew what they would be&mdash;the witty,
gay, and charming letters she wrote to her friends, things worth
preserving for their human quality of humour and sympathy, their
wide culture, their keen tact.</p>

<p>He had read some of them, and found all her hidden graces in
the frank words. Of his to her, and hers to him, he did not even
think&mdash;on his side they had been instantly destroyed; and
she told him that she had not preserved a line that he had ever
written.</p>

<p>There had never been very many, for their separation had been
of brief duration and infrequent, but there had been enough to
tell everything. Her perfect discretion had been amply justified
by the tragedy of her sudden death.</p>

<p>Had she left anything behind that could have betrayed the
secret of her life, how fair an edifice of faith and belief and
kind friendship had she not ruined, how much bitter pain had she
not inflicted!</p>

<p>But there had been nothing among what had to be burnt after
her death in London, nothing among the things she had at Vyse
Park to mar her husband's memory of her; her memory remained
equally unspotted to both Mathew Attenbury and George Vyse.</p>

<p>His delicate discretion that kept inviolate their perfect love
made Attenbury absolutely confident that George would never
discover anything that was not pleasing to him among what Anne,
taken so swiftly, so unprepared, had left behind.</p>

<p>As he neared the house, and looked across the beautiful lawns
where the foreign trees still showed richly dark with foliage in
the English bareness of winter, at the plain, red-brick building
with the stone portico and flat windows, where he had spent such
jewelled hours of almost unearthly happiness, his heart
contracted with a pain nearly unendurable.</p>

<p>He came to a stand&mdash;a tall, cloaked, and muffled figure
in the fading light, graceful and powerful, with that air of
suppressed strength that must ever belong to healthy youth,
however quiescent it may be.</p>

<p>He forced back the rising agony and went slowly on.</p>

<p>It would be pleasant to see George again, after all; he was
fond of George.</p>

<p>The two men met in the library, a place brown and gold and red
in hue, old, worn, and pleasant, with the dim-coloured pictures
above the mantelpiece and dim-coloured books on the plain
shelves, desks and floors polished, and chairs in faded crimson
leather, and dull-hued carpets on the floor.</p>

<p>All was lit by the living hues of the firelight, which was
tinting everything with a glow of gold and pink, like wine and
roses mingled.</p>

<p>There was no other light save one thick candle, which stood on
the desk by which Sir George Vyse awaited his guest.</p>

<p>He was still in complete mourning, without a sword, and looked
ill, almost old; but his handsome features retained their kindly
expression, his manner an air of pleasant composure.</p>

<p>The two men, both typical, leisured gentlemen of fine breed
and comeliness&mdash;though there was a touch of wildness in
Mathew Attenbury's dark good looks that, however subdued by
quietness in dress, was unusual in one of his nationality and
station&mdash;met and greeted each other without reference to the
occasion of their coming together.</p>

<p>Mathew, whose senses were in general exquisite, and to-night
even more than usually alert, noticed at once that George had
changed; there was something about him dull and sombre, something
neither happy nor cordial.</p>

<p>The lover, glancing at the husband out of softened eyes, more
than pitied this man who had such meagre memories with which to
brighten his bleak life.</p>

<p>He himself felt at that moment such a rush of passionate joy
at the thought of what his own past held that the room seemed as
bright to him as if it had held her actual presence.</p>

<p>"We both loved her, and she loved only me&mdash;only me!"</p>

<p>Exulting in this thought, a glow came into his cheek and his
fine eyes shone tenderly; he was able to speak of her with that
calm sorrow that was allowed him.</p>

<p>"You have found some of Anne's things?" he remarked.</p>

<p>On the heavy desk that held the one candle was a light
writing-case in blue velvet, adorned with seed pearls and tied
with ivory ribbon.</p>

<p>Mathew Attenbury smiled at this with great love and
understanding, it was redolent of Anne; everything she had owned
was rich and beautiful.</p>

<p>"Letters," said George Vyse&mdash;"a few letters."</p>

<p>Mathew seated himself by the great fire; he did not trouble
much about what the other man was saying or doing&mdash;it was
such a wonderful sensation to be here, under her roof, among her
possessions, that she was dead hardly seemed to matter.</p>

<p>"I do not know what to do," said Sir George, "that is why I
sent for you. I do not know what I feel even. I suppose I must be
a fool."</p>

<p>Mathew glanced at him. So poor George was just finding that
out.</p>

<p>"How can I help you, cousin?" he asked gently. The other still
stood by the desk, irresolutely fingering the blue velvet
portfolio.</p>

<p>"You knew her so well, Mathew, you were such friends; you were
akin in so many matters that I knew nothing about."</p>

<p>"So you noticed that, did you?" thought Mathew beneath his
silence.</p>

<p>"So perhaps," continued George Vyse, "you could advise me what
to do."</p>

<p>"Surely," returned the younger man, "you need no advice as to
what to do in any matter that concerns Anne?"</p>

<p>"If she had been what I thought," said the widower, "I should
have been in no difficulty, cousin."</p>

<p>Mathew Attenbury had been about to move; he now remained
motionless, slightly leaning forwards.</p>

<p>"These are love-letters," added George Vyse in the same flat
tone, "not written by me."</p>

<p>Mathew tried to laugh, to speak, to do something to ward off
this monstrous thing that had suddenly crashed on him; he could
only make a silly sound of horror.</p>

<p>"Wonderful letters," said Sir George; he untied the strings of
the portfolio and laid bare on the white lining about twelve
letters, bound with a gold cord. "They loved very much, these
two. I did not know "&mdash;his lip curled with a smile dreadful
to see&mdash;"that there was love like this outside of
story-books."</p>

<p>Mathew Attenbury rose. He had a confused sense that something
was expected of him, that there was something he could do to
redeem this hideous moment; but all his faculties were occupied
by the horror of what had happened&mdash;their secret betrayed,
their love profaned, her memory spoilt, George struck to the
heart, and he&mdash;and he&mdash;</p>

<p>Why, they must try to kill each other. It all seemed more
grotesque than tragic; he dully put his hand to his sword.</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought of that," said George Vyse. "The obvious
way&mdash;the only way, I suppose, you will say. I have been
thinking about it a great deal&mdash;when I have been sitting
here alone with her letters."</p>

<p>"You have known then&mdash;some time?"</p>

<p>"Several weeks."</p>

<p>"And you never sent for me before?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;to what end? I do not know quite why I sent for you
now after all, it is between me and her. I am almost sorry that I
have told you what I have found."</p>

<p>"But I should have guessed," replied Mathew Attenbury. "You do
not seem angry," he added curiously.</p>

<p>"Angry?" Sir George smiled. "I wonder if anyone was ever angry
with Anne? You know, I really thought she loved me. She said
so&mdash;so often&mdash;in many ways."</p>

<p>Fury touched Attenbury. He had never cared to glance at Anne's
relations with her husband, it was a subject he had never allowed
himself to think of. It was ugly to think that she had persuaded
George that she cared for him. Yet&mdash;he strove to be
reasonable&mdash;what else could she do?</p>

<p>"What was she?" broke out George, after a bitter pause of
silence. "What am I? A quiet woman&mdash;these letters&mdash;why,
'tis as if they were written to a&mdash;why, I never thought she
even knew of such love."</p>

<p>Attenbury interrupted.</p>

<p>"Cousin, words are so silly. There is only the sword."</p>

<p>"Why should I give her that?" replied the husband. "She had
everything&mdash;her own way always&mdash;and always the laugh of
me."</p>

<p>His body was convulsed with a long sigh; he covered his face
with his hands for an instant.</p>

<p>"Burn the letters, Mathew, burn them!" he muttered. "They
seemed to me&mdash;<i>alive</i>. I could not throw them in the
flames. Do that for me."</p>

<p>With a bent head he left the room.</p>

<p>Mathew felt sick to the soul. He accused Anne of having
betrayed him by this strange carelessness with regard to his
letters. Why should she, in face of all her promises to him, have
kept what would ruin all their love?</p>

<p>Then his tenderness overcame his reproach. How she had loved
him to have so treasured, in the face of all prudence, his words
of adoration! Poor George!</p>

<p>He went to the little portfolio, and a sense of exultation
touched him. How they belonged to each other for all
time&mdash;his Anne!</p>

<p>He took up the letters, meaning to destroy them before
George's mood changed.</p>

<p>He dragged open the cord, he took out the letters, he stared
at the passionate sentences addressed to "Anne&mdash;my Anne!"
The period of the letters covered many months. They were clearly
in answer to equally passionate letters from the woman.</p>

<p>The signature was that of the stupid young soldier at whom
both he and she had laughed.</p>

<p class="first">RIDE is the first of the deadly sins and painted
in the likeness of a peacock; there are few without this sin in
great or small degree, and there is no sin so likely to catch a
man by the heels and trip him into Hell's Mouth."</p>

<p class="first">So spake the old monk, sitting by the fire,
talking to the young novices on the long winter's evening; they
liked to listen to the holy stories the old monk told them, for
there was always a good comforting moral and some matter of
interest too, for he had been in the world once, and remembered
it well enough, though he was now so far on the path to
heaven.</p>

<p>"A man without pride," he continued, "is a saint, and a man
all pride is a devil, and a dangerous devil especially if he be
not a man at all, but a woman."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the novices wisely, and they looked into the fire
and shook their heads and pursed their lips.</p>

<p>"The monk finished his glass of Hippocras, wiped his lips and
proceeded to tell the story of pride, the first deadly sin.</p>

<p>"When I was in Paris." he said, "learning theology at the
Sorbonne, I often saw riding in a gilt chariot&mdash;the
Queen."</p>

<p>"The Queen!"</p>

<p>"As you may have heard, her name was Isabeau, and she came
from the East; her clothes were a wonder, her life was a scandal;
she was quite the proudest creature any man had ever seen or
heard of; she boasted that she had never set her foot in the
public street nor in the house of one who was of less than blood
royal; there was always a body of the Scottish Archers about her
car to prevent the mud from touching her wheels, and the foul
breath of the baser sort from reaching her.</p>

<p>"But she did not mind their eyes; indeed, she was always
raised high on her cushions that they might see her, and if she
was in a litter, the curtains were drawn, and her beauty was
displayed as freely, nay, as wantonly, as that of any common
creature who goes about seeking her price.</p>

<p>"The treasury was empty because of her vesture and her
servants and her dainty meats, her silk sheets, her baths of
rose-water; the soldiers were few and so were the ships; the
peasants were rioting in the country; the nobles pawned their
plate, but the Queen went in cloth-of-gold and wore the keep of a
regiment in a single ring.</p>

<p>"You will have heard of the king...He was foolish in his mind,
and played with clocks and cards all day long in his closet; his
only company was his jester, and they were both in frayed robes
and ill-nourished. He neither saw the Queen nor asked after her;
they said that she had broken his heart and shattered his wits
long ago.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

<br>

<p>"There were, of course, many cavaliers in her train&mdash;I
have told you she was beautiful; her eyes and her hair were
tawny, like a dark tiger-skin, her complexion was clear yet
golden, the carnation deep in the cheeks. The whole effect of her
face was golden; she sparkled and glowed without the aid of
jewels.</p>

<p>"It was said she put dye upon her lips and cheeks, the juice
of scarlet geranium petals; I do not know, nor did it matter; she
was beautiful as only a proud, shameless woman can
be&mdash;beautiful to strike the eye and hold the heart, to
excite, to subdue, to awe, to lure...</p>

<p>"I often saw her ride past the Sorbonne; her head-dress three
or four feet high, scarlet, sparkling with gems, and hung with a
thin white gauze veil, that now floated away from her face and
now obscured it...Across her shoulders the fine ermine robe,
flecked here and there with black, would fall apart, disclosing
the loveliness of her bosom beneath the thin cambric sewn with
pearls that edged her purple velvet bodice, and then it would be
drawn together by the fairest hand in all the world, aye, and on
this hand there glittered the royal gems of France.</p>

<p>"She was always alone, always drawn by white horses, eight of
them without a speck or flaw, and always followed by the most
brilliant knights and nobles in the kingdom&mdash;her humble
servants all of them, her lovers, some; Duke Franois or another
of her favourites close behind her, almost as magnificent as she
herself, and almost as proud. She ruled France in those
days&mdash;ruled it hideously, without justice, without sense,
without pity, her sole object the making of money for her own
magnificence.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;there was no one to gainsay her, and her splendour
and her licence pleased the great nobles, I suppose&mdash;at
least they supported her; in the streets and the country-side she
was cursed with many oaths, for a foreign wanton, a tyrant, a
creature who sucked the blood of the nation. What did she
care?</p>

<p>"She never heard them, or, if she did, if any occasional
murmur did penetrate the scented atmosphere she breathed, it made
no impression on her gilded charm. She was cruel.</p>

<p>"She was also very like the peacock in this; there was little
else but pride in that small head beneath the high crown.</p>

<p>"So it happened that she let her ruling vice destroy the only
thing she cared for&mdash;if indeed it was possible for her to
care; who knows?</p>

<p>"One day when she rode abroad she saw a young man looking from
an upper window; his arms were folded on the sill and the
sunlight was on his face.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2300361h-images/SDS-1-002.gif"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>"This was no unusual sight, nor was the admiration in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"But the Queen looked at him a second longer than her usual
wont.</p>

<p>"And the next time she rode that way (it was near the <i>'Prs
aux cleves'</i> and May, and very sunny weather) he was there
again, and yet again until in all it was seven times she had seen
him leaning from the window in the full sunlight looking down at
her. The Duke Franois saw him; he saw the Queen look up and the
young man look down, but he thought naught of it, so serene was
he in his pride; could he imagine Isabeau would ever smile on one
not of royal blood, or the greatest among nobles?</p>

<p>"So the Duke went his way, swaggering through Paris, and there
came a day, about the beginning of June, the court being then at
Vincennes, when the young man climbed the palace wall and dropped
right at the feet of the Queen where she sat alone in the
orchard, in the daisied grass, with her psalter on her knee.</p>

<p>"What followed was a miracle&mdash;you may believe what I say,
though, for I had it from the young man himself: she rose to her
feet&mdash;she was in silk from head to foot, with gold on her
hair, and he in his ordinary garb, for he was no more than a
student at the Sorbonne&mdash;and she held out her arms and came
to him and they kissed without a word.</p>

<p>"They loved each other; from the first instant their eyes had
crossed they loved each other. She had never loved
before&mdash;not even Duke Franois; yet her pride was still the
stronger, for although she was a woman utterly without shame she
kept this love secret&mdash;had she loved a Prince she would have
flaunted it, but this was only a poor clerk and all her wit and
her power were turned to conceal her passion.</p>

<p>"For a while she contrived it&mdash;for she had all France at
her service. and who was there to spy on her, or to dare to speak
if they did, and of whom should she be afraid?</p>

<p>"There was one&mdash;Duke Franois&mdash;but in her pride and
her absorption in her new love, and her great haughtiness, she
disdained hint.</p>

<p>"She had dismissed him from her favour as lightly as she would
have blown a feather from her sleeve, and <i>his</i> pride was
sorely his and his ambition also. I do not know what they had
ever been, the one to the other, but she had given him her
confidence, and made him virtually King of France, from which he
had soaring hopes and delighted in the power her favour left in
his hands. But there came a time when she must needs consult him
on some affairs of State that she was too idle to attend to or
too ignorant to understand, and the Duke perceived in her the
effect of advice not his own, and this angered him. For her
personal coldness to himself he cared little enough, I think. He
was as proud as she and as cruel, but neither so reckless nor so
foolish. It was said he schemed to take the place of the poor
silly King and would have stopped at nothing to this end, if he
could have cloaked his design beyond discovery.</p>

<p>"He made no complaint now of the Queen's waning favour, nor of
the daily humiliations she put on him&mdash;for she was not a
prudent woman, and too proud to conceal a changed feeling; he
served her ever with the same graceful readiness, but his
courtesies only masked the fact that he was employing all his wit
and skill in findings out his rival, so that he might be
revenged.</p>

<p>"At first he suspected the princes of the blood, the court
gallants&mdash;yet he wondered at her secrecy, and his careful
watching and spying convinced him that it was not one of these
who had taken his place.</p>

<p>"For a while he was baffled, for she was most
careful&mdash;cautious and secretive for the first time in her
foolish life&mdash;and she had not a single confidante...</p>

<p>"But the young clerk was also ambitious, and the excessive
fears of discovery of the Queen had began to gall him; he thought
that she might have brought him to court, and let him ride openly
beside her in cloth-of-gold through the streets of Paris. Yet he
dared not even suggest such a thing; for when once he hinted to
the Queen that she might gild his obscurity she told him that did
he once lift his head out of the crowd, Duke Franois would set
his heel on that head and crush it into the dust. So he had to
content himself with his secret influence on the affairs of
France&mdash;he wrought diligently and skilfully on the evil
little Queen, and she trusted him with the secrets of the
statecraft of France, and he advised her and gave her long
scrolls of parchment covered with what she must do, and she
meekly obeyed him; it seemed in those days as it she would do all
to please him&mdash;all and anything save own him.</p>

<p>"You might think that he would have been content, yet he was
not, for she had made him take a great oath that never, no matter
at what pass, would he disclose that the Queen had loved him.</p>

<p>"This oath rankled within him day and night, till he began to
irk and fret at the concealment and to consider what he might
have achieved had she set him beside her on the throne of
France&mdash;of how he might have been bowed down to and
worshipped by those people who now took him as naught and never
turned their heads to look at him.</p>

<p>"So in all these three pride became the one thing burning up
all other passions: in Duke Franois, angry pride had been
supplanted, killing all lingering tenderness for the Queen,
humbled pride in her began to dim her true ardour for her
plebeian lover, and baffled pride in the clerk began to stifle
the passion he felt for Isabeau.</p>

<p>"As the months rolled round to another summer this conflict of
pride with the softer emotions of their bosoms became a thing
unbearable to all three.</p>

<p>"The Queen had a secret door in her apartments in the Louvre,
and when the nights were moonless, and her women dismissed, she
would take her lantern and in some cunning disguise or other go
forth, let herself out of the Palace with her own keys, hurry
along the dark streets of Paris and meet her lover either at the
<i>'Prs aux cleves'</i> where his house stood, or in the
cemetery of the Couvent des Innocents, which stood open day and
night. In this ghastly place they met not only for love, for the
young clerk, in defiance of God and eaten up and maddened by
pride, was seeking to raise the Devil or one of his emissaries,
who, as he hoped, might help him to thwart the Queen and gain the
place he longed for in the councils of France.</p>

<p>"And Isabeau helped in these experiments&mdash;her design,
which she kept as secret as her lover kept his, being to obtain
the aid of the Devil in safely removing Duke Franois, whom at
last she was growing to fear.</p>

<p>"Perhaps a woman's instinct warned her that under his serene
air of homage he might be working her fatal mischief.</p>

<p>"She was only afraid of one thing in the world, and that was
the discovery of her common lover, and she knew that this very
weak spot was that which Duke Franois would not like to
strike.</p>

<p>"About the very heat and height of summer, when the war was
faring badly (the English burning and slaying close within a
hundred miles of Paris), the people bent beneath taxes heavier
than any taxes had been yet even in the bad Queen's time, the
harvest poor and rotting on the stalk, the air filled often with
storms and the echoes of riots and rebellions and fierce
punishments in Picardy and Normandy and Provence, Duke Franois,
after six months of spying and watching, saw, with his own eyes,
Isabeau go forth and meet a common clerk in the graveyard of the
Couvent des Innocents.</p>

<p>"And then Duke Franois began to raise the Devil, too, after
his own fashion.</p>

<p>"The nest day he was the Queen's courtier as usual, bowing and
humble at her side, and she was more than ever haughty and cold
with him, for his quiet presence and soft manners were becoming
daily more intolerable to her and an affront to her
pride&mdash;yes, an affront to her pride to look at him and
imagine his laughter did he know her secret&mdash;his laughter at
her, the Queen!</p>

<p>"But that evening she was relieved of him; he went to
Acquitaine, where his estates were, on the excuse of a rebellion
among his vassals, and that he must go to punish with sword and
fire those who murmured against his iron government.</p>

<p>"But he left behind him strange rumours&mdash;it was said that
Devil-worship and Devil-raising were going on in Paris, and that
to these unholy dabblings in the black arts were to be traced the
misfortunes and disasters overtaking France.</p>

<p>"The priests, who had been made desperate by the silence of
the Blessed God to whom they prayed, and somewhat discomposed
besides by the temper of the people, who began to complain of a
scant return for all their ollerings in the churches, were eager
enough to catch at these rumours and to encourage and inflame
with Holy zeal the miserable citizens of Paris, who, in truth,
between Queen Isabeau and the English required no Devil to plague
them.</p>

<p>"In a short while the rage against Devil-worshippers and the
search for them became so fierce in France, and especially in
Paris, that Isabeau's lover was frightened and begged her to
desist.</p>

<p>"But she was the Queen&mdash;she could not imagine danger and
herself in the same company; she was infatuate in her study of
black magic, and mad to raise the Devil and learn from him how to
be rid of Duke Franois&mdash;and how to get money&mdash;for she
had wrung almost the last mavaredi out of France and she was one
who needed to be gorged on gold to live.</p>

<p>"She would not turn back, and so it came about that on one
night in August&mdash;the fourteenth day of August&mdash;in the
year '20, this scene took place in the cemetery of the
Innocents.</p>

<p>"You may believe what I say, for I was there.</p>

<p>"It was a hot night, but thick, loose black clouds raced
across the full yellow midsummer moon and the two figures
crouched behind a gaunt tomb were sometimes in silver light and
sometimes in complete darkness. One was the Queen and one the
young student of the Sorbonne...</p>

<p>"That night she looked most beautiful; she wore a red
<i>'coteardie'</i> and black hose (she was habited like a man)
and a short purple cloak and a purple hood drawn over her ebony
hair&mdash;but no poor sentence of mine could describe the flash
and sparkle of her face, the delicate carnation of her cheeks and
lips, the velvet sweep of her brows, the shade and softness of
her throat: she was a beautiful woman&mdash;beauty itself, sirs,
the pure beauty of the flesh.</p>

<p>"They had made a horrid brew in an iron cauldron. There were
loathsome ingredients in it, that the youth shuddered to handle,
but Isabeau cared not; the cauldron stood against the tomb and
round it were traced pentacles and mystic signs in white
chalk.</p>

<p>"The Queen's white hands were busy in setting fire to the
sulphurous mass that she had piled beneath the cauldron, when the
moon sailed languidly free of the clouds into the clear dark
ocean of heaven, and glancing up, she saw she had raised the
Devil indeed; he stood beside the dark wall of the tomb in the
guise of Duke Franois.</p>

<p>"She raised her hand to shield her face&mdash;she thought of
that even before she turned to flee; but he seized her upflung
arm and dragged it down and held her fast. 'Majesty!' he said,
and in that one word she heard her degradation and realised, for
the first time perhaps, the utter depths of her fall.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2300361h-images/SDS-1-003.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</div>

<p>"For the moment sheer terror was uppermost; she appealed to
his manhood the weaker to the stronger&mdash;an ancient instinct
that had long lain dormant in her imperious soul, but it did not
soften him to see her abasement; his pride was mounting as hers
sank, he remembered how she had flouted him, and that this was
his vengeance.</p>

<p>"He called up his men; they came hurrying across the
graveyard.</p>

<p>"Here mark his devilry&mdash;<i>they were all fellows he had
brought from Acquitaine&mdash;who had never seen the
Queen</i>&mdash;and who beheld now nothing more than a couple of
youths caught in the infamous and deadly practices of black
magic.</p>

<p>"After them came a whole pack of the baser sort, carrying
torches and lanterns and accompanied by several of those fierce
dogs of the kind men take with them when they hunt highwaymen and
night ruffians, and these, with the enthusiasm of the chase, and
the delight of seeing the quarry cornered, and the hope that now
the Devil-worshippers were caught the misfortune of France would
cease, were beside themselves, leaping, shouting and pushing
forward across the gravestones, and only held in check by the
pikes of the Duke's men from Aquitaine.</p>

<p>"It may he imagined that though some of them may have glimpsed
her golden chariot in the distance, none knew the Queen.</p>

<p>"And she stood with her back against the wall, facing them in
the moonshine, so pale now compared with the angry red dancing
light of the coarse resin torches of the crowd.</p>

<p>"As for the other youth, the student I mean, he stood numb and
bewildered and frightened to death, yet (with the instinct to
stand by the woman) staying where he was, though none held him.
Isabeau looked up at Franois.</p>

<p>"'You must save me,' she said haughtily, and she signed
furiously to her lover to leave her&mdash;but he, poor fool! did
not understand and instead drew nearer to her, clapping his hand
to his outmatched sword.</p>

<p>"Why should I save you, little witch?' cried the Duke in a
loud voice, and he beckoned his followers nearer. 'See justice
done to these two,' he said, 'who were so manifestly raising the
Devil! What shall their punishment be?'</p>

<p>"And they shouted violently, 'Death'&mdash;and Isabeau cowered
a little, and then looked at Franois again and saw what revenge
he had prepared for her&mdash;she must declare herself before
these churls or be done to death by them; there was no pity in
Duke Franois&mdash;she knew it in an instant.</p>

<p>"I think that in that instant, too, she had taken her resolve.
Pride is a deadly sin, but always a brave one.</p>

<p>"She folded her arms on her bosom and looked sideways at the
mob, who ever pressed nearer with shouts of hatred.</p>

<p>"'Tell them who you are,' said the Duke. 'Give then, sweet,
your name and quality.'</p>

<p>"She shot a glance up at him and hell-fire flashed in her
eyes; she said nothing. He swung her round to face her
persecutors. At that the student sprang forward, hardly knowing
what he did&mdash;or what had happened. 'Whom do you
touch&mdash;do you know who this is?' he cried, himself not
knowing who Duke Franois was. But the Queen turned on him with
all she knew of royalty in her looks and gesture.</p>

<p>"'Silence!' she commanded, 'or I curse you!'</p>

<p>"He fell back at that and was seized by the Duke's guard. He
hung his head, he had no great desire to speak, nor for anything
on the earth, for he saw that her love had vanished in a
flash&mdash;that she thought no longer of him...that she was the
Queen now, and no longer his lover...</p>

<p>"'Speak!' cried Franois. 'Will you not speak?'</p>

<p>"Surely he had never believed she would carry it so far...but
her sole answer was to laugh.</p>

<p>"She stood full in the moonlight, a small figure, but
dauntless; she slipped the royal signet from her finger and
dropped it into the rank grass&mdash;she had only to show it to
gain instant safety, remember.</p>

<p>"But she set her foot on it instead, and laughed at
Franois.</p>

<p>"He had cone to shame her and he saw she was minded to baulk
him, and in his rage and his fury at the sight of pride carrying
her so far he stepped aside and with a gesture offered her to the
rage of the crowd.</p>

<p>"His men lowered their pikes and the people surged
forward&mdash;little knowing on whom they were wreaking vengeance
at last.</p>

<p>"And she slid not speak...she put her cloak before her face
and set her back against the tomb.</p>

<p>"And so died the Queen of France; when the crowd had finished
with her she need not have feared recognition.</p>

<p>"Her tattered corpse was flung into a ditch&mdash;and the Duke
rode over it when he left the graveyard; maybe some of her blood
was on his horse's hoofs.</p>

<p>"At least he respected her pride; it was given out that she
was dead of sudden fever, and there was a gorgeous
funeral&mdash;with a gorgeous doll in her place, while her bones
were nosed by swine.</p>

<p>"The student escaped," added the monk, "or how should I be
telling you this?</p>

<p class="first">HE monks were in the garden gathering the herbs
for the distillery where their sweet wines, potent spirits and
fragrant perfumes were made.</p>

<p>The four arcades of the cloister encompassed them, slender
red-brick arches with the head of an angel in white glazed
pottery above each group of clustered pillars.</p>

<p>Overhead the sky was summer blue, against which rose the
graceful height of the campanile; the monastery stood on a hill
covered with fruit gardens, vineyards and cornfields, and was
reached by a toilsome, winding road, so that it seemed very far
from the world indeed, more than half-way to heaven, if heaven
was as near as the monks believed.</p>

<p>The square garden in the midst of the cloisters was on the
very summit of the hill and in the very centre of the buildings;
it was divided into four parts&mdash;the herb garden, the flower
garden, the fruit garden and God's garden, which was the
graveyard, and grew neither herbs nor fruit nor flowers, but only
little rusty iron crosses above the roughly turned sod.</p>

<p>The four divisions were marked by broad, low box edges
bordering pleasant paths, and in the centre was a white alabaster
well on four white alabaster steps; the ropes and buckets hung
from a light iron framework, and round about, in the crevices of
the slabs, grew maiden-hair fern and the small, odourless Italian
violet.</p>

<p>In the flower garden were roses, carnations, syringa, freesia,
stocks, wallflowers, lilies in bloom, and jasmine, magnolia,
gardenias, oleanders and myrtles still only covered with green;
in the herb garden grew bushes of lavender as high as a man,
tufts of sweet basil, thyme, pepper, mint, clove, citron,
mustard, camomile, ginger, fennel and iris.</p>

<p>The fruit garden was shaded by fig and pear trees; beneath
them grew currant and gooseberry bushes, orange and lemon trees,
raspberry canes and strawberry beds.</p>

<p>There the novices were walking with Father Aloysius.</p>

<p>In one corner of the fruit garden was the fish-pond, and some
of the novices sat on the brick rim and ate figs.</p>

<p>They ate one for the Eternal Father, three for the Holy
Trinity, one for the Virgin and seven for her seven sorrows.</p>

<p>Father Aloysius ate ten for the ten Commandments as well, and
then twelve for the twelve Apostles, for the figs were just ripe,
soft and green and gold and purple, creamy white and deep rose-
pink inside, with a perfume, faint indeed and evasive, but
delicate and seductive enough, as Father Aloysius said, to tempt
Saint Anthony.</p>

<p>And he ate seven for the seven active virtues, and seven for
the seven theological virtues.</p>

<p>Then he began to talk of the sin of Gluttony or Greed, as it
is called in the rude tongue, but in the classical
<i>Gula</i>.</p>

<p>Now Gluttony, or <i>Gula</i>, is the second deadly sin, said
the monk, and is unlimited indulgence of the body, as Pride or
<i>Superbia</i> is indulgence of the mind; and whereas from Pride
spring many minor sins, as Disobedience, Hypocrisy, Impudence,
Arrogance, Impatience, Irreverence, Strife, Vainglory, Spite and
Swelling of Heart&mdash;for indeed Pride is the very root of all
the sins&mdash;so out of Gluttony come various other sins, as
Sloth, Selfishness, Sourness, Discourtesy and
Witlessness&mdash;it is, in fact, a very ugly and horrid sin, and
directly against the commandment of God. He who is a slave to
Gluttony may not well withstand any other sin, and certain it is
that no glutton was ever vet a saint.</p>

<p>The novices continued to eat figs as they drew round the fish-
pond to listen; they sighed at the wickedness of the world and
smiled to think how safe they were from it.</p>

<p>Now as Pride, continued Father Aloysius, is shown in the
figure of a peacock with a crown and a beautiful coat, who thinks
of nothing but how he may display himself, so is Gluttony shown
in the resemblance of a pig, which is a very unpleasing beast,
bare of adornment, composed of naught but flesh, with a great
nose and mouth always searching for food, and a body so fat his
legs can scarcely support it. When he can find nothing to eat he
sleeps, and he has no wits at all, and no disdain of dirt or
filth, but rather delights in it; his voice is rough and harsh,
and he hath an unlovely odour. As this beast is, so is the
glutton, for ever followed by contempt and laughter, the pointing
of fingers and the shooting of lips.</p>

<p>Indeed it is doubtful if there be any sin which is so
disdained as this, for a man may not be a glutton and keep his
dignity, nay, he may not be a glutton and save his soul alive,
though of most other sins this is possible&mdash;with submission
to Holy Church. Now how this second deadly sin, which is the ugly
sin of Gluttony or <i>Gula</i>, may directly lead to a miserable
end in this world (to say nothing of what punishment is in store
in the next world, the which is only known to the wrath of God
and the ingenuity of the devil), is shown in the story of Denis
D'Espagnet, who was a merchant of Marseilles in France, and at
first a very personable young man, albeit always given to this
sin of Gluttony, though it must be admitted that he had no
others, at least none that were noticeable: but, as I have said,
this sin sufficeth.</p>

<p>He had a very noble and princely fortune, a fine mansion in
the town, and many ships in the port; but it must not be supposed
that it was a fortune of his making, for what glutton was ever
industrious? It is against nature.</p>

<p>It was his father who had made and left all this wealth, for
he was a very thrifty and wise merchant, and generous and
courteous withal.</p>

<p>He dealt with the East, with Algiers, with Barbary, with
Turkey, India and China, and he brought gold and silver, ivory
and spices, silks and jewels, perfumes and porcelain, strange
birds and animals and cases of fruits and sweetmeats; and his
fame for his fair bargaining, his great wealth and his high
connections, was great. He lent money to Princes, to the King of
Cyprus, the Doge of Venice and the Pope of Rome.</p>

<p>The King of France was in his debt, and, being willing to
favour him, stayed under his roof before he sailed from
Marseilles to fight the heathen.</p>

<p>It was winter weather, and in the royal guest's chamber burnt
a great fire perfumed with cascarilla, and while the King stood
before it, warming his hands, D'Espagnet cast into the flames all
the King's bonds for the money he owed him, thereby setting him
free from the burden of his debts; so that this fire cost many
thousands of gold pieces.</p>

<p>Now it is manifest he would have done better to have made the
King pay his just debts and have given the money to Holy Church,
but this was the action of Hilaire D'Espagnet, and fine and
princely it was considered.</p>

<p>But his son was a different man: he thought nothing of gaining
money nor of spending it, but only of this ungodly sin of
Gluttony.</p>

<p>His feasts were famous in Marseilles, nay in all France, for
at no other table could such delicacies be found as at his.</p>

<p>From all over the world came the meat, the game, the fish, the
fruit, the vegetables on which he fed, the rare and costly wines
which he drank.</p>

<p>A hundred cooks were kept busy day and night devising new
dishes, and the master cook had the wage of a king's general, and
wore round his neck a gold chain, one link of which would have
ransomed a lord.</p>

<p>There were brown cooks from India who looked to the making of
spices and sauces, yellow cooks from China who held the secret of
many strange recipes unknown in Europe, French cooks for the
pastries, Italian cooks for the creams and jellies, German cooks
for the baked meats and the mulled beers, Spanish cooks for the
chocolate and the game, Persians to mix the sherbet and the fruit
drinks, and two English cooks to make what they call in that
country "rosbiffe," "biffstek" and "plumpouding."</p>

<p>In his garden were great tanks full of trout and crabs and
lobsters, trees laden with fruit&mdash;and many growing under
glass and kept warm with fires in the winter, that he might never
lack all the year round.</p>

<p>There were huge beds of lettuces, asparagus, tomatoes, onions,
radishes, artichokes, fennel and marrows in the places where his
father had had roses and carnations; these were all uprooted now,
for nothing might remain in the garden which was not good to
eat.</p>

<p>He had two hundred men looking after these things, a vast yard
where he kept fat fowls and ducks and pheasants and herons and
peacocks, and a plot of cabbages on which great white snails were
fed; the Chinese cooks could make wonderful soups out of
snails.</p>

<p>He neglected his business, he had no liking for the company of
ladies nor for the converse of friends, he went from his bed to
his table, and when one meal was ended he sat on cushions and
thought of the next, or, to get an appetite, he walked round the
garden and admired the juicy fruits and the succulent vegetables,
and the fat birds waddling up and down.</p>

<p>And there was one dainty he loved more than another, and that
was citron pie. A plain and an ordinary thing, said Father
Aloysius, it may sound to you, but you must not think of citron
pies as you may have seen them, with a sodden crust and pulpy
fruit within&mdash;nay, these pies, as made by the master cook
himself, were very different.</p>

<p>They were no bigger than a lady's palm, the crust was so
delicate you could blow it away. The centre was a perfect ripe
peach, and over that a jelly of strained strawberries, over that
whipped cream mixed with violets, and round about all a circle of
snow flavoured with slices of citron, the whole enclosed in a
silver filigree basket, frozen and sprinkled with jasmine buds
preserved in sugar.</p>

<p>Such were the pies that Denis D'Espagnet prized above all
sweetmeats; he even began to write verses in their honour, but
was too lazy to do more than the first line.</p>

<p>He lived in this manner for several years after his father
died; his fortune diminished through neglect, but he did not
care, for he still had ample for his food, and his person became
fat and round so that a piece the shape of a half-moon had to be
cut out of the table at the place at which he sat; but he made no
trouble of that, and lamented not at all his lost comeliness, but
lived contentedly until one day (a fatal day for him!) a fellow-
merchant, who had been one of his father's friends, came to visit
him, and Denis made a feast, and the hundred cooks worked all day
and all night, for the other merchant was not wholly free from
the deadly sin of Gluttony. After the feast, which lasted three
hours, the master cook himself brought in the citron pies, and
Denis placed two of them on the plate of his friend and waited
with complaisance, for he knew well enough that there was no
excelling these dainties in the length and breadth of the
world.</p>

<p>The friend tasted them.</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>Denis still waited for the usual sigh of rapture; lie waited
so long that the master cook paled, thinking he had forgotten one
of the ingredients.</p>

<p>"Well enough," said the merchant at length. "But not like
those I have eaten at the Court of the Khan of Barbary."</p>

<p>Denis trembled like the quince jelly before him, and the
master cook burst into tears; it was the first time either of
them had heard such heresy.</p>

<p>"Something is lacking," continued the friend. "I know not
what&mdash;nay, I cannot fix the flavour&mdash;but something is
hopelessly wrong. If you were to taste those made for the
Khan&mdash;ah, then you would know the difference!"</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2300361h-images/SDS-2-001.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>So the feast ended dismally, and that night Denis could not
sleep for thinking of the citron pies made at the Court of the
Khan of Barbary.</p>

<p>And the next day, before his friend departed, Denis begged and
besought him by some means to procure for him the recipe of these
same tarts.</p>

<p>But the friend laughed and said that the only Christian who
had ever gone into the Khan's kitchen had come out as a pie
himself&mdash;a great pie which had been served at the supper of
the Prince's lampreys.</p>

<p>After this, life was spoiled for Denis; he could think of
nothing but those pies, more perfect than his own, being eaten
daily at the Court of the Khan.</p>

<p>The master cook, too, fell into a melancholy and became
careless, and once a pheasant came to table with the upper side
browner than the under, and a peach was served with a speck in
the skin.</p>

<p>Denis began to take no pleasure in his food, he lost flesh, he
brooded, and at last he resolved to go to Barbary himself, visit
the Khan, and taste the pies with his own lips and tongue.</p>

<p>Greatly he groaned at the exertion, for never yet had he left
Marseilles, but his ruling sin conquered; one of his galleons was
prepared; he took the master cook with five under him, great
store of food and wine, two friends, a skilful captain and a
sturdy crew, and set sail for Barbary.</p>

<p>Now he had hardly got to sea before his troubles began, for
the rolling of the ship begot in him a sickness so that he
groaned and cried for very unhappiness, and all the captain could
do with the telling of witty tales did not serve to cheer
him.</p>

<p>The cooks were ill, too, and there was nothing to eat save the
ordinary ship's rations which the sailors could prepare; but for
once (for the first time, indeed) Denis did not think of
food.</p>

<p>The captain told stories of the journey to Samarkand and of
the tomb of Timour Beg, built of stone green like water, of the
camels crossing the desert with nets hung with silver bells over
their packs, of the wild and curious beasts he had himself seen,
such as the manchora, whose teeth fit nto one another like combs
put together, who has a blue body, the feet of an ox, the face of
a man, and a trumpet-shaped tail whereon he blows, making a
fearsome noise; Denis, however, gave no heed to these marvels,
but lay and lamented.</p>

<p>But on the tenth day they sailed into smoother waters that
were clear as an emerald, and one leaning over the ship's side
could see the terrible sea-beasts at play, and the pearls and
coral and amber, ready for the gathering up.</p>

<p>Denis had no taste for these things, and begged the captain to
put back to Marseilles; but his friends overruled him, saying
that they might get to Barbary as soon as they might get to
France.</p>

<p>Yet it had been well for Denis if he had had his way, for on
the twelfth day up came a great sea-rover with black sails, and
quickly made captive the French galleon.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2300361h-images/SDS-2-002.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>Now it chanced that this rover was from Barbary, and the
Marseilles captain explained that they were peaceful people and
honest traders, and that his master was on a visit to the Khan
himself.</p>

<p>But this availed them nothing, for the Barbary captain told
them that his Prince was so vexed by the attacks of the King of
France upon various heathen Princes who were in league with him,
that he had himself declared war against all Christians.</p>

<p>Whereupon Denis proclaimed his name, which was a great name
and well respected in the East; and when he heard it the heathen
leapt for joy, for, said he, it is well known that that is the
name of the Christian who lent the King of France money that he
might war against the Mussulman, and the Khan will be greatly
rejoiced to have him as a prisoner.</p>

<p>Denis with many tears and cries declared that he was not
responsible for his father's work, and that he had never lent a
maravedi to a single soul&mdash;but what availed that?</p>

<p>He and his friends and the cooks, the captain and the crew,
were bound and put in the hold, and the rover made all haste to
Barbary, where he delivered his captives to the Khan.</p>

<p>The cooks (alas for the frailty of human nature!) turned
Mussulmans and so were taken as slaves into the houses of rich
heathens; but Denis and his friends and the captain were staunch
to the true faith, for they were never asked to forsake it; they
were lodged in the royal prison, and the crew were sent to the
royal galley; it is quite plain that the blessing of Heaven was
not on that voyage.</p>

<p>These unfortunate Christians were cast into a miserable
dungeon that looked into the Khan's garden: the window was no
bigger than two hands put together, the walls were rough and the
floor was clamp, and once a day bread and water were given to
them, so that they sat and bewailed themselves.</p>

<p>But his guardian angel had not forsaken Denis, and still
contrived to give him a chance to save his soul alive and die in
penitence.</p>

<p>The Khan's daughter was in the garden among the lilies when
the captives were taken to their prison, and she chanced to fall
in love with Denis, who had become comely again, his flesh having
shrunk from lack of food and misery.</p>

<p>Stout he still was, but fat is admired amongst these heathen,
and the maiden herself was named Full Moon, because she was round
and white, having been fed on butter to make her plump and
bleached to make her fair.</p>

<p>Now the Khan went away hunting, and on his return intended to
have the prisoners impaled to celebrate his birthday; but the
maid was cunning enough, and with tricks and bribes she got the
sentries away from the prison, and down she came one evening,
veiled, scented with geranium and wearing a petticoat of gold
silk, a petticoat of white satin, trousers of silver gauze, and
all manner of gems and chains of gold and silver, and she put her
face to the window and cried softly, "Denis!" (for she had found
out his name) "Denis!"</p>

<p>He, hearing the voice and fearing some heathenish trick,
desired the others to answer, but they would not; and presently
he went himself, trembling with fear.</p>

<p>But when he fixed his face in the window and saw the Khan's
daughter he smiled, and she lifted her veil and sighed.</p>

<p>Denis, being desperate, made love to the lady. He praised her
figure and her face and her kindness (it is true that she was
much to his taste)&mdash;and presently he asked for some
food.</p>

<p>She stood on tiptoe and kissed the end of his chin (she could
reach no further, neither could he get his head out of the
window), and promised to return with meat and drink.</p>

<p>And now the other prisoners clamoured to know who it was, for
they could see nothing; and Denis, willing to keep his good
fortune to himself (for what is food for one shared among four?),
said it was the sentry telling him the Khan was away, and that
when he returned they would all be impaled; then when they were
again asleep he went to the window and waited for the
Princess.</p>

<p>Faithfully she came, and brought with her a basket and handed
up to him baked meats and roast game and almond cakes, fruit and
iced sherbet, till the tears of joy ran down his face.</p>

<p>And while he ate she told him that she had a scheme for his
escape, that she would become a Christian for his sake and they
could fly away together to his country. Meanwhile she promised to
come every night and bring him food.</p>

<p>And so she did, and never a drop or a crumb did this glutton,
for lust of his sin, share among the others, though he got daily
fatter and fatter as they got thinner and thinner.</p>

<p>Strange looks they began to cast on him, for, they said, it is
strange that he on bread and water should become again fat and
round and soft, even as he was at Marseilles.</p>

<p>But he declared it was the grace of God sustaining him because
he said the Pater Noster every night, and as his guardian angel
saw to it that the Princess came only when they were asleep, they
were forced to believe this, though no flesh grew on their bones
even if they said their Pater Noster thrice over.</p>

<p>One day Denis recalled the whole aim and purport of his visit,
and, quivering with excitement, asked Full Moon to bring him some
citron pies such as were served at her father's table.</p>

<p>The next night she brought them, twelve of them on little
plates of saffron yellow porcelain...</p>

<p>And Denis admitted that they were indeed better than those
made by the master cook, and every day he ate them and became
fatter still, for the pies were full of cream and butter and egg.
So things went for a month, and then the Princess told Denis that
all was arranged. She had contrived to steal the keys of the
prison, and of the garden, she had swift horses prepared to carry
them to the sea, and she had his galleon, all manned with
Christians ready to take them to France.</p>

<p>To celebrate the news Denis ate five-and-thirty citron
pies.</p>

<p>Now the next night, while the others slept, he sat waiting for
the maiden to open the door, and never a thought did he give to
these unfortunates, who were in mortal danger of death through
him and his nasty greed&mdash;for why had the journey been
undertaken but for his gluttony?</p>

<p>The time passed, the ivory moonlight was pouring into the
cell, the <i>bulbul</i> was singing outside, the rustle of the
tamarisk and the pepper tree filled the air, and presently the
door was softly unlocked and the Khan's daughter stood before
him, wrapped in a black veil, and carrying such of her father's
jewels as she could find, tied in a scarlet cloth.</p>

<p>Up sprang Denis, and she whispered to him to Haste! haste! for
the Khan was returning that very night.</p>

<p>Haste he made indeed, but nothing did it avail him; for see
the horrid consequences of this ugly sin of Gluttony or
<i>Gula</i>, see the judgment of Heaven on this wretched
sinner!...</p>

<p><i>He could not pass the door.</i></p>

<p>Yea, so fat and large and gross and heavy had he become that
there was no getting him through that narrow door, either
sideways or frontways or backways&mdash;the Princess stepped into
the garden and pulled, he heaved and puked till the sweat ran
down his face, but it was useless: not even half of him would
pass.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2300361h-images/SDS-2-003.gif"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration"> </div>

<br>

<p>His groans and moans awoke the others, who quickly dragged him
back into the cell and stepped into liberty themselves.</p>

<p>The Princess, seeing this, began to shake with fear and would
have run back to the palace had not at that moment one of her
slaves come panting up, saying the Khan was home.</p>

<p>Then the maiden, realising how desperate the case was, and
being vexed with the great fatness of Denis, besought the three
other Christians to escape with her, telling them of all her
preparations.</p>

<p>Whereat they came right gladly: the captain and the Princess
mounted on one horse, and the two friends on the other, and they
thundered through the white town and the blue night down to the
sea, where they found the Christian vessel and so were saved,
together with the other poor souls, to the great glory of
God.</p>

<p>Full Moon married the captain, who came into all the
possessions of Denis, for he, in the great fear and terror of his
first days at sea, had made a will leaving all his money to the
captain if he brought him safe to land; and sure enough, the
captain said, "I did bring him safely, or would have done if the
heathen had not captured us."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Denis groaned and moaned in the prison and struggled
to get out of the door&mdash;but what was the use? His guardian
angel was tired of this sinner.</p>

<p>The Khan heard these cries and came to the prison...Ah, he was
a wrathful heathen when he found that his daughter had escaped
with all the Christians in his dominions.</p>

<p>No use were the cries and entreaties of Denis: the Khan's
master cook entered the cell and dispatched him, and in several
portions they conveyed him away to the kitchens; flavoured with
bamboo shoots and mustard he fed the Khan's lampreys for a
week.</p>

<p>So you see, added Father Aloysius, the result of this horrid
sin of Gluttony.</p>

<p>Clearly enough the novices saw it; they sighed and shook their
heads.</p>

<p>Then, as they had eaten all the ripe figs, they all went into
the refectory to supper.</p>

<p class="first">T was the middle of October; the chestnut trees
in the valleys, the olive trees on the hill-side were heavy with
fruit; on the sloping roofs of the cottages the figs were placed
to dry; the gold and scarlet leaves of the vines hung shrivelled,
and the grapes, purple, yellow, green and rose-coloured, were
revealed clustering to the bare poles; the oranges and lemons
hung green as jade amongst the fresh foliage; in the garden
scarlet flowers bloomed and tall spears of tuberoseloysiusay long
the sun shone warmly, but at night there were heavy rains, and
the winds were chilly in the shadows.</p>

<p>While the monks worked in the distillery the novices made the
wine, and Father Aaloysius directed their labours.</p>

<p>The big barns outside the convent were filled with vats into
which the novices trod and pressed the grapes. The brown fingers
and the brown feet of the novices were stained a dull red, red
also were the butts, and rivulets of red ran in and out between
the square paving-stones of the courtyard.</p>

<p>Hot and tired were the novices; the vintage was nearly over,
and the wooden taps began to yield the bright liquid of the fresh
wine, while the drained niasses of bloodless grapes were thrown
into the garden, where numbers of pale wasps devoured them.</p>

<p>The novices were discontented as well as tired; the Prior was
entertaining a certain Prince, on his travels through the
country, and all day long his knights and squires went to and fro
the gardens and courtyards, holding their noses because of the
smell of the fermenting wine, and raising their skirts and
mantles out of reach of the trickling lees.</p>

<p>The novices marked them, marked their air of contempt, their
scornful laughter, their sniffs and puckerings of brows and lips,
marked also their garments, the nets of gold and silver on their
heads, their hats with green and blue feathers, their mantles
embroidered with silk and woollen, their curious boots, tasselled
gloves and wonderful daggers; and because of all this, and
because they were labouring in rough brown habits, they became
vexed at their vocation and wishful that they, too, were in the
world.</p>

<p>And they were still further discontented when two of the
knights, seating themselves on a low pink stone wall over which
the last roses poured their yellow blossoms, began discoursing
lightly of holy things in a loud tone, so that the monks working
at the vintage could not fail to hear.</p>

<p>And one knight told the other a story of a certain sinner who
had gone to Rome to see the Pope.</p>

<p>His Holiness was in his palace of St. Giovanni in Saterno, and
he received the penitent in the garden.</p>

<p>It was springtime (said the knight), and the square of garden
between the white marble cloisters was planted with
violets&mdash;nothing but violets&mdash;and in the centre was a
small fountain of alabaster from which trickled water as clear
and sparkling as a diamond. Near this fountain the Pope was
walking, and so humble and pious was he that he wore the robe of
an ordinary monk and was telling over a string of white beads,
each caryed from the bone of a saint.</p>

<p>Now when the penitent entered the garden he felt afraid and
uneasy&mdash;he knew not why: afraid as if he were in the
presence of something horrible&mdash;uneasy as if in the presence
of something eyil.</p>

<p>The penitent thought it must lie with the violets; there were
so many of them, and the enclosed scent of them was so strong as
to make the head giddy.</p>

<p>Albeit, he told his sin to the Pope and was absolved.</p>

<p>But even as he was leaving he turned him back and said: "There
is one thing more, Holiness, I have often wondered at: how can
one know a damned soul?"</p>

<p>"A damned soul?" repeated the Pope slowly.</p>

<p>"Even so&mdash;is there no sign by which one can tell it? I
have asked many people, and they all have said, By a certain red
light in the eyes, a reflection of hell fire. Is this true,
Holiness?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell if it be true?" answered the Pope, and he
stooped for his rosary, which he had dropped.</p>

<p>So the other made his reverence and was for leaying, but as he
passed through the shade of the cloisters, he chanced to glance
back.</p>

<p>The Pope was looking in his direction, and the eyes of his
Holiness glowed red as a coal from the Pit&mdash;red, red and
shining with flame.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2300361h-images/SDS-3-001.gif"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>Then the penitent turned and fled, and ran, and ran, and ran,
because of the horror that was on him, until he came to the
Tiber, and there he threw himself in and was drowned, for no one
may see such a sight and live.</p>

<p>And when the knight had finished discussing this story, he and
the rest moved away laughing.</p>

<p>Now at this moment up came Father Aloysius to taste the wine,
and to him the novices recounted the tale they had heard told by
the knight.</p>

<p>Make no account of that (replied the Father); now is his time,
and he may levant and flourish in his impiety and wantonness: but
the time will come when the Devil and his imps will snatch him
away by the yellow hair of which he is so proud, and for all his
cries and lamentations the saints and angels will take no heed of
him.</p>

<p>I perceive (continued Father Aloysius, seating himself on the
pink wall) that ye are discontented on beholding all the
splendour of these knights.</p>

<p>But I tell you that Luxury&mdash;or Luxuria, in the classical
tongue&mdash;is the third of the deadly sins. I have already told
you of Pride or Superbia, Greed or Gula, and what comes of them;
and now I will tell you of Luxury or Luxuria, which is given
under the form of a goat, a creature of unbridled desires, as
deaf to the voice of man as the sinner is deaf to the voice of
God, and one of the symbols of the Evil One himself&mdash;he who
sees an ape riding on a goat has certainly seen the Devil riding
his favourite steed.</p>

<p>There was once (said Father Aloysius) a young man whose father
kept him very straitly: every day he Went in frieze, a suit of
four years' wear patched and darned, and for the winter a collar
of red fox from which all the hair had fallen.</p>

<p>No natural joyance or pleasure of youth was allowed him; when
the other young men went out to the games, or to see the horse-
racing, or the Morality in the public square, he had to remain at
the window of his father's great dark palace and watch them with
longing eyes.</p>

<p>When the young maidens went out to the fields beyond the city
to gather the first flowers of the spring, he was never among the
cavaliers who escorted them; when they returned with round
bunches of roses, red and white, and long boughs of hawthorn, it
was never to him that they offered favours taken from their
posies&mdash;no, for him there was nothing but the passing
glance, the light laugh or the smile of pity.</p>

<p>There was poor food in the palace, though it was served on
heavy silver; there was thin wine in the glasses, though they
were cut crystal; there were worn coverlets on the beds, and the
moth had eaten the damask hangings, and dust had tarnished the
gold thread of the armorial bearings in the tapestries.</p>

<p>For the father of Giulio (such being the name of this most
unfortunate young man) was held body and soul by another deadly
sin&mdash;that of avarice.</p>

<p>But when he was not very old he died, leaving behind him as
much wealth as would have bought twice over the city in which he
lived.</p>

<p>He left no heir but Giulio, and that youth now found himself,
from a position of humiliating poverty, the most wealthy person
in the land&mdash;which is to say, the most envied, the most
admired, the most courted.</p>

<p>Everything was now changed in the old palace. Sculptors,
painters and architects worked day and night to beautify it; the
ceilings were soon covered with pictures like glimpses of
Paradise; the walls were inlaid with precious marbles, yellow,
black, white and grey; in all the dusty corners, hitherto known
only to the spider, hung silken draperies of scarlet and crimson;
the gardens, so long lifeless and parched, bloomed with the
oleander, the palm, the orange, the camellia and the rose; the
dried basins of the fountains were replenished with crystal water
in which swam golden fish; the weeds were cleared from the lake,
which now bore on its pellucid surface swans white as spring
blossoms.</p>

<p>The worn, tattered furniture disappeared, and in place of it
the palace was set out with chairs and tables of rare scented
woods, inlaid with ivory and ebony; with couches covered with
satin cushions; with sideboards hearing dishes and goblets of
rock crystal, of agate, of sardonyx, painted lustre plates and
tall glasses coloured like milk and rubies; with carpets of
Persia, a thousand hues mingled in their silken woof; with
tapestry from Arras, stiff with thread and gold.</p>

<p>And the stairs that had been so silent now echoed the sound of
gilt shoes, the swish of trailing mantles, the clatter of swords,
the rustle of silk; and the rooms which had been so long empty
were filled with perfumee and sighs and laughter and gentle
breaths and the wind of fans.</p>

<p>Giulio was transformed; instead of a doleful youth shrinking
in worn homespun, he was a splendid young man, robed like an
Emperor's son; he was gay, he was witty, he was
generous&mdash;and, naturally, he was very much loved.</p>

<p>Never had the town known such gaiety. Every night there was a
festival; every day there was a hunt, a tourney, races, games or
some such diversion. It was as if a shower of gold had been
poured over the place: the miser's money was in everyone's
pocket, the praise of his son on everyone's lips.</p>

<p>Now this was a merry life for Giulio, and never did he pause
to think of aught save this world, nor did he bestow a single
penny on good works.</p>

<p>Nay, every holy monk who came to his door, begging the crumbs
for the poor, was sent rudely away. "When I was in misery," said
Giulio, "no man came to my aid, and now will I help no one, nor
will I haye about me these miserable fellows, but rather those
with bright looks who amuse me."</p>

<p>So his life went for a year or so, and during this time he had
not once entered a church, or given money to the poor, or even
laid a bunch of flowers before a wayside shrine&mdash;costly
lilies and roses he would throw beneath the feet of some foolish
woman, jasmine and camellias he would twine in her hair; but he
could not spare even a cluster of wild violets for the Mother of
God.</p>

<p>One day in full summer-tide, when Giulio felt suddenly and
strangely weary of all his joyous companions, he chanced to find
himself alone on the road some miles from the city gates; he was
separated by the chances of the chase from his fellows, and not
sorry to be alone. Nevertheless, he felt both hungry and
fatigued; and as he had lost his way to the meeting-place, it
seemed as if he had no chance of sharing the sumptuous collation
his servants had prepared.</p>

<p>A storm was coming up; the sun shed a strong gold light from
beneath a mass of purple cloud; the russet chestnut trees that
filled the valley were half in violet shadow; a little wind cast
the white dust up from the long road.</p>

<p>Turning a corner, Giulio suddenly saw before him a little
house which stood back from the road in a herb garden.</p>

<p>The road was familiar to Giulio, but he had no remembrance of
this house; indeed, so astonished was he at the sight that he
reined up his horse and rubbed his eyes. There it was, clear
enough&mdash;a square white house standing full in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>And in the garden a man in a dark-red robe was picking herbs.
He carried on his arm a flat basket of withes full of lavender,
basil, marjoram, saxifrage, vervain, citronella, clove, camomile
and rue, the mingled odour of which made the air peculiarly
heavy, fragrant vet sickly; and as Giulio looked, he wondered at
the great size and beauty to which these herbs attained. There
were no flowers in the garden, only these tall, blossomless green
plants.</p>

<p>"Friend, who art thou?" asked Giulio; and the man in the red
robe looked up from his work.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have all manner of names," he answered pleasantly. "We
are old acquaintances, Don Giulio, and presently shall know each
other better still."</p>

<p>The young man felt horribly afraid; he did not like the storm
which was blowing up across the valley, nor the sunny white
house, the long white road, the man who was working there; all
seemed to him as strange as some bad dream from which lie would
be indeed glad to awake.</p>

<p>"Will you dismount and rest a little?" asked the herb-
gatherer.</p>

<p>"Nay," said Giulio hastily. "I must endeavour to find my
companions."</p>

<p>"Will you take some fond and wine?" offered the other.</p>

<p>Giulio shook his head and made to ride on, but his horse would
not advance.</p>

<p>The man in the dark red habit came and leant on the fence; the
purple clouds had now overspread the whole sky. "You are very
anxious to leave me," he remarked. "Why in such a hurry to get
away now? One day soon you will begin to spend eternity with
me."</p>

<p>Giulio's heart knocked against his side, his face went white
as paper, and his hair rose on his head. "You must," he groaned,
"be the Devil."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the personage, leaning on the fence; "and
we shall meet again very soon, Don Giulio."</p>

<p>"No!" shrieked the young man. "I defy you, I defy your arts! I
am a Christ-born child. I defy you!"</p>

<p>"So they all say at first," returned the Devil. "But it is not
the least use. The next time you pass this little garden of mine
I shall have to ask you for the pleasure of your company."</p>

<p>With this he bowed very courteously and turned away, and the
storm broke, blotting out the landscape with rain and darkness,
and Giulio's horse bolted with him along the white road, nor
stopped until he reached home, covered with foam and shivering
with terror.</p>

<p>Giulio was also frightened. He tried to forget what he had
seen and heard, he tried to believe that it was all a dream or a
delusion, and more eagerly than before he filled his days with
riotous living and surrounded himself with noisy and extravagant
companions; but, as indeed Diabolus himself had warned him, it
was no use, and in his heart Giulio knew it was no use; in the
middle of the feast he would suddenly sec before him the sunny
house and the herb garden, in the middle of the night he would
wake up and see the figure of the personage in the red robe.</p>

<p>At length a day came when he could bear it no longer&mdash;he
confessed to a priest and prayed for his advice; but the holy man
shook his head and told him he could do nothing for him. Then a
deeper terror possessed the young man; he became gloomy and thin,
and careless of his former pleasures; and one day he mounted his
horse and rode to Rome and threw himself at the feet of the
Pope.</p>

<p>His Holiness was very, very old, and quite tired of life; he
sat in a little black chair near a sunny wall, and the little
lizards ran over his gilt shoes, so still he sat. His calm was
like medicine to the distraught soul of Giulio, and there,
kneeling among the daisies, he told his tale. When he had
finished the Pope remained still a long while, thinking.</p>

<p>Then he said, "My son, there is only one way in which you can
save your soul from the Father of Evil. You must build, to the
Glory of God, a complete church. Complete. Not a brick must be
lacking. Inside and out it must be inlaid with coloured marbles;
every altar must have a painting above it; every image a lamp
swinging before it. Adjoining must be a convent for the holy
monks, a baptistery and a campanile. There must be a great garden
for the comfort of the brothers, a fish-pond, an orchard, a
vineyard."</p>

<p>When the Holy Father had got thus far Giulio interrupted him.
"All this," he said dolefully, "cannot be accomplished in the
life of one man."</p>

<p>"But you, my son, have exceeding riches, and riches can do
more than life."</p>

<p>"But it would take all the riches I possess," complained the
young man.</p>

<p>The Pope smiled. "All the better for your soul, my son. You
will no longer be able to dissipate your days with riotous
companions, but must spend your time in contemplation of the Holy
Edifice you are erecting; and when it is finished and the last
stone is in place, and the lamps all lit and the incense burning
before the altar, then, then alone, you will know that your soul
is saved and that you can defy the Devil."</p>

<p>Giulio considered. "Is there no other way?" he asked at
length.</p>

<p>"No other way," nodded the Pope. Giulio turned to go, and
before he had left the garden His Holiness was asleep in the
sun.</p>

<p>The young man returned to his native city; he called together
artists, sculptors and architects; he bought a piece of land on a
high hill outside the town walls, and the church began to be
built, the gardens to be laid out, the orchards and vineyards
planted, the convent walls to rise up, brick by brick.</p>

<p>"So I defy the Devil," thought Giulio, and this prideful idea
that he was setting himself against the Evil One so possessed him
that he forsook his former extravagant ways and lived modestly,
and thought only of the church and how it night be finished
swiftly and worthily.</p>

<p>And whereas before he had been a mere object of wonder and
amazement, and the beloved of vain fools, now he was praised by
the good and the poor, for his church was becoming the wonder of
the country, and the building of it gave employment to hundreds
of artists and thousands of masons.</p>

<p>Ten years went by and the church was nearing completion, so
lavishly had Giulio spent his fortune and so diligently had the
workmen laboured.</p>

<p>One morning in spring Giulio rode out of the town to the sea-
coast, and, sitting idly on a grey rock, watched the sea.</p>

<p>It was early morning, and the sea was a dim colour betwixt
gold and silver, the misty blue of the heavens was veiled with
faint pink clouds, and on the horizon gleamed a great golden
argosy.</p>

<p>Now, while Giulio was idly gazing at this distant ship, which
looked like a flower fallen from heaven, and idly wondered what
port it had sailed from and to what port it was bound, he heard
the sound of gentle but very desperate sobbing.</p>

<p>All amazed he sprang up and gazed about the long, pale sands;
and presently, in the mouth of a cave of green marble, he saw a
beautiful woman seated and weeping dismally.</p>

<p>She wore a white velvet gown embroidered with roses made of
clustering rubies; her hair was unbound, and fell down either
side of her face on to the sand, where it looked like virgin
amber newly washed clear by the tide.</p>

<p>On her little feet were shoes that each seemed one red rose,
so sewn were they with rubies, and all her raiment was marked
with wet sand and stained by seaweed. When she heard Giulio's
footstep she looked up&mdash;and oh, but she was lovely! So
beautiful was she that if she had been seated in the desert the
unicorn would have come and put his head in her lap and the lion
would have licked her hand.</p>

<p>Now while Giulio was building his church he had not thought at
all of love and ladies; but when he saw this one as she sat
before him, with her knots of amber hair falling about her
shoulders, and the crystal tears shining in the violet eyes which
lit the loveliest face ever beheld, it was as if a fierce flame
brake out in his heart, consuming all thought of, and desire for,
anything but this woman.</p>

<p>As he stood staring at her, all bewildered by this new
passion, she rose up (just like a blossom she stood, straight,
with a drooping head), and, blushing and sighing and weeping,
with soft glances and sweet looks and sudden smiles, she told him
her story.</p>

<p>She was a Princess, she said, and her name was Blanchefleur,
and the golden argosy that Giulio had noticed was carrying her
from one of her father's kingdoms to another (for he was a mighty
Emperor), when her stepmother had bribed some creatures of hers
to throw her overboard; which they had done, first tying together
her hands and feet: yet by the help of the Madonna she had been
saved, for she remembered nothing after the blackness of the
water until she found herself, with the ropes gone from her
wrists and ankles, on this strange shore.</p>

<p>Such was the damsel's story. Few beside Giulio believed it;
rather was she accounted a witch or a fairy, or some such unholy
creature. Yet say what they would, Giulio married her&mdash;yea,
within three days of that meeting on the shore was she his
wife.</p>

<p>Now before long he began to find that to keep this lady cost
near as much as to build a church, there were so many things she
needed&mdash;gems, rich garments, chariots, feasts, palaces and
slaves; nor did she fail to remind him that she was an Emperor's
daughter, nor did he fail to give her all she asked for, for he
loved her with a deathless love.</p>

<p>Little by little he began to neglect the church; it was so
nearly finished, he was confident that he had defeated the
Deyil&mdash;and Blanchefleur cared naught for the building of the
holy edifice, but rather she led him gradually back to his old
life, su that soon he preferred to sit and hold her mirror while
she combed her amber hair, rather than to watch the painters at
work on the altar-pieces; and would sooner kneel on a cushion at
her feet while she sang a loye song than go and hear matins or
vespers in the new church.</p>

<p>And at last his great fortune began to yanish; he spent less
and less on the church, and more and more on Blanchefleur. He
borrowed money, he sold land and palaces, he pledged the merchant
ships be had at sea. The years went on, and still the church was
not complete; the tower remained bare bricks, unlaced with
marble, and the gilt angel with the sword which was to stand on
the summit remained in the porch.</p>

<p>Again and again the Prior sent to him and humbly begged him to
give orders to finish the tower, and the young man always
replied, "To-morrow."</p>

<p>Now when he had sold all he could sell, and pledged all he
could pledge, the day came when his creditors gathered round him
demanding payment, and Giulio found that of all his great
possessions there was hardly one white piece remaining that he
could call his own.</p>

<p>Then, like a man awakening from a deep dream of Eastern
delight to the cold grey of a winter morning, he remembered his
soul and he remembered the church; he ran to the tower where
Blanchefleur sat, and took her in his arms and kissed her again
and again.</p>

<p>"Blanchefleur." he said, "I have lost everything, and am like
to lose my soul too." He began to weep. "Give me the locket I
gave thee yesterday&mdash;for I have nothing left in the
world."</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

</div>

<br>

<p>Blanchefleur said nothing; with a smile she took the diamond
heart from the long chain by which it hung over her violet gown
and gave it him, and he went swiftly out and sold it for five
hundred ducats.</p>

<p>With the bag of gold in his hand he went sadly, sadly, humbly,
humbly, up the hill to the church, and a great number of people
ran after him, out from the city gates, cursing him and hooting
him, for he owed more than he could ever pay.</p>

<p>But he hid the gold in his mantle and escaped them, and, pale
and breathless, reached the convent and the Prior's room.</p>

<p>The Prior was painting a Book of Flowers; he sat in a black
chair at a black table which was covered with the little plants
he was copying.</p>

<p>"It is a long time since you have been here, Don Giulio," was
his greeting.</p>

<p>The young man bowed his head. "I wish to finish the church,"
he said, "but this is all the money that I have."</p>

<p>He untied the canvas bag and emptied the gold coins on to the
black table among the little plants.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the Prior, "that is not enough&mdash;the marble
alone will cost two thousand ducats&mdash;and to raise the
angel&mdash;"</p>

<p>Giulio stayed to hear no more; he knew that nowhere could he
get two thousand ducats...with a shriek which made the Prior
shiver to his heart he turned and fled.</p>

<p>Only one thing was left to him now, and this was
Blanchefleur.</p>

<p>More than ever did he love her in this moment of his utter
desolation; she was more to him than a mere woman, however
dear&mdash;she was the symbol of all his loves and lusts and
likings, and of that Deadly Sin for which he stood condemned to
hell. She was lost, too, he thought, one with him; and as if with
winged feet he ran to her through the hooting town.</p>

<p>She was still in her tower. The creditors were taking the
tapestries, the mirrors, the pictures from the walls; all was
howling confusion in the palace, the slaves had fled&mdash;but
she sat still in the seat of the arched window looking out on the
garden.</p>

<p>"Blanchefleur!" cried the wretched young man.
"Blanchefleur!"</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him and began to laugh; she laughed
and laughed&mdash;he sprang forward to seize her, and she broke
and vanished in his hands; then he knew her for what she
was&mdash;a doll, a puppet sent by the Evil One to lure him to
his ruin.</p>

<p>Then did this most unfortunate young man run out of his ruined
palace and aimlessly flee from the town hack towards his
church.</p>

<p>For even if it be unfinished, thought he, surely they will
give me an asylum where by great prayer and penitence I may save
my soul.</p>

<br>

<p>But he had not gone far on the long white road before he
turned a corner and saw a sunny house standing in a herb garden.
The personage in the dark red robe was leaning over the fence; he
smiled and held out his hand and caught Giulio's flying gown, and
drew him in through the narrow, open gate.</p>

<p>Nor was he ever seen again on the earth&mdash;but long
remained an example of the terrible end that comes to those who
follow this sin of Luxury.</p>

<p class="first">NE November day, when the novices were seated
round the fire in the kitchen roasting chestnuts, a dispute fell
out between two of them on some trifling matter, and Father
Aloysius, who had observed much quarrelling of late among them,
took the opportunity to talk to them of the fourth deadly sin,
which is Ira, or, in the vulgar tongue, Wrath, which is the very
sin, together with Pride, that caused Lucifer to be cast from
heaven.</p>

<p>And this story that Father Aloysius told was not one of his
own knowledge or his own country, but one that had been imparted
to him by a certain Magister, who came from the bitter and
barbarous North, and had for a few days been a guest at the
convent.</p>

<p>And he, having witnessed divers curious things in his own
land, had made a great book of them, together with paintings
clone to please his fancy, and the receipts for certain charms
and a credible relation of his journeyings in search of the
Philosopher's Stone, which, he declared, was in the hands of the
Jews.</p>

<p>And several of these tales he had copied out and left with
Father Aloysius for his instruction, declaring he knew them to be
true, and that they had all happened in his time, and to his
knowledge.</p>

<p>So this evening the monk brought down the manuscript of the
Magister and read aloud the tale entitled, "A very Faithful
Account of Some late Marvellous Happenings in the town of&mdash;"
(for prudence, the name of the town was omitted, but the Magister
had called it Alstein in Franconia). And this was the tale.</p>

<p>In a certain town there was a woman dwelling who was
universally held to be a witch.</p>

<p>She came of a great family, and had in her time been dowered
with lands and castles, but some mysterious disgrace had fallen
on her youth, and she had nothing left but a small farm where she
brewed beer and made sausages and kept a few herons, whose
feathers she sold in the moulting season, and by these, with the
revenue from the beer and the sausages, she made her living,
though she used all means to disguise this fact, and pretended
that she had wealth from her lands and forests which no longer
existed, as all knew well enough; but, as I have said, she was a
witch, and who dared offend her? The whole town was in awe of
her, from the Sheriff to the humblest peasant, and the tricks she
had played on those who offended her were enough to fill a volume
by themselves.</p>

<p>Her name was Ottilia Von Angers, and surely never did anyone
disgrace a proud old name as she disgraced hers! Woe to the town
that sheltered her! (For she was not a native of this place, but
came from long off somewhere in Swabia, I think; at least her
former history was not clearly known.)</p>

<p>Well, this fine morning in May she jumps out of bed, puts on
her worn old velvet kirtle and her old brass chain which she had
rubbed up to look like gold, and off she goes to the market to
buy the herbs for the beer and the meat for the sausages. To
right and left such bowing and salutations and lifting of caps!
You would have thought it was a fair young maiden going abroad
instead of an old hag with a face yellow as butter looking her
full seventy years (though she admitted to scarce fifty).</p>

<p>There she was in the market-place, bargaining and chaffering
and shrieking out on the impudent rogues that dared to cheat a
high-born lady like her, when she saw a little cart being driven
full speed through the buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>There was only one person in it, and she was an old woman
wrapped in a black cloak with her grey hair blowing out behind
her; every one stared at her, for she was a stranger. And Ottilia
was so interested that she stopped bargaining and hobbled after
the cart.</p>

<p>When she came up with it, it was stayed outside a stall and
the old woman had descended&mdash;and what was she buying but two
new brooms!</p>

<p>So Ottilia pushes up to her and the following conversation
began:</p>

<p>Who was she, what was she doing here, and why was she buying
brooms?</p>

<p>Her name was Trina Von Ebers; she was a poor woman, God help
her, and she made her living selling cheeses. As for the brooms,
she was buying them to sweep out the new house she had
taken&mdash;servants were such sluts, as the noble lady must
know.</p>

<p>These words pleased Ottilia, for she was proud as Diabolus
himself, and she answered, yes, indeed, well she knew it,
therefore she kept neither man nor maid; and now she remembered
she required a broom herself, and these seemed strong and cheap,
though God knew how these people cheated and lied.</p>

<p>So they fell bargaining over the brooms and the new-comer said
she had come here to live, and to open a dairy for butter and
cheeses, and she hoped the noble lady would accept the present of
a dish of her best butter (and good it was, she ventured to say)
and a fine round cheese.</p>

<p>This immensely flattered Ottilia, who at once asked if her
dear friend would come to dine with her. She had just brewed some
new beer&mdash;as to her name she was Ottilia Von Angers, and a
well-dowered maiden.</p>

<p>The other hag accepted, and Ottilia hurried home to prepare
the feast.</p>

<p>On the way she met a scullion of the sheriff's household, and,
stopping him, she asked him what his master had for dinner.</p>

<p>To which the boy replied&mdash;a great game pie, two side-
dishes of venison, an almond cream and a cake of cherries.</p>

<p>So home went Ottilia.</p>

<p>Now, though she had told old Trina she kept no servant, it was
not true, for she had an old porter whom she nearly worked to
death, and when she reached home, him she sent with a message to
the Sheriff saying she heard he had a pie, two dishes of venison,
an almond cream and a cake of cherries for his dinner, and she
begged he would send them to her, together with a cask of white
wine, for she desired to feed the poor of her neighbourhood, like
the pious woman she was.</p>

<p>And in case he felt disinclined to send, she reminded him of
what had befallen him the last time he would not help her
charities, viz. his mouth had been twisted up to his ear, and so
had remained for a week, which was doubtless God's judgment on
him.</p>

<p>Then the hag starts cleaning up the room and laying the table
and putting the furniture to the best advantage; then she goes
into the bedroom and fetches a small white monkey and she puts on
him a pair of green breeches and a blue coat, he crying the while
and preferring his nakedness; but my hag boxes his ears and
quiets him.</p>

<p>Then back comes the porter with the Sheriff's dinner following
him, borne by two cook-boys, for the Sheriff would as soon have
faced the whole army of the Margrave as deny anything to
Ottilia.</p>

<p>So the table was ready, and the wine broached and the beer
poured, and in came the other hag in a great cloak of catskin
dyed to look like sable.</p>

<p>And Ottilia's greeting was&mdash;where were the cheese and the
butter?</p>

<p>Well, could she carry them through the streets and she in her
fine clothes? No, indeed, but to-morrow the servant wench should
bring them.</p>

<p>This threw a cloud over their meeting, but they sat down to
the Sheriff's dinner and began to gossip and chatter and say how
wicked the world was, and how birth and blood met with no respect
now-a-days, whereas any fat churl with a gold piece in his pocket
got more deference than a belted baron.</p>

<p>And the monkey sat on the table eating from Ottilia's plate
and snatching the best morsels while she talked.</p>

<p>And Ottilia brought the conversation round to the cheese, and
Trina said she would send for it, and, ringing the bell, summons
the porter and bids him run down to her house and ask the maid
for one of her best cheeses.</p>

<p>Then the fellow answered: no, he would not run on any of her
errands, she was not his mistress.</p>

<p>What, did he dare speak to a lady with that rudeness?</p>

<p>Lady! She might well call herself a lady, for no one else ever
would. Why, she was no better born than he.</p>

<p>Then the hag started screaming; he had better take care, she
knew how to deal with churls like him! She was a high-born maiden
and could prove it!</p>

<p>The porter burst out laughing.</p>

<p>Why, she was seventy or more, and as for high-born, that she
was not, he could see; and not fit to sit at table with his noble
mistress.</p>

<p>At this Trina screams out to Ottilia to chastise her insolent
servant; but it chanced that Ottilia had been by no means
displeased by the fellow's rudeness: first, because Trina had not
brought the present; secondly, because of the show she had made
in the dyed catskin; thirdly, because the man had cunningly
flattered her in his last speech.</p>

<p>So she said: well, the boor was rude, but it was no fault of
hers, and her friend should have left him alone; after all it was
her place to send the cheese, as she had promised. At this Trina
crosses her thumbs under the table, and, making a grimace at the
porter, she hurries away.</p>

<p>Ottilia should have the cheese and might she enjoy it!</p>

<p>So my hags part coldly.</p>

<p>And Ottilia, looking after her guest, sees her dancing and
leaping about the entrance and making faces at the porter. So
down she comes running with a beer-mug in one hand and the monkey
on her shoulder; but when she had reached the gate Trina had
gone.</p>

<p>Now that night the porter was taken ill, so that his groans
and cries echoed through the street; his head swelled, needles
and pins ran out of his mouth, and something seemed to run up and
down inside his throat, so that it was very plain that he had a
devil.</p>

<p>So they carried him to the church and put him on a litter
before the altar, where he lay like a dead man.</p>

<p>And beside him sat Ottilia, sighing and groaning and declaring
the fellow was bewitched and she knew who had done it: it was
that wicked woman who had lately come into the town to sell
cheeses; it would be a charity to all good Christians to burn her
and her cheeses too.</p>

<p>After the fellow had lain there all night and never moved,
they sent for a holy priest from the neighbouring village who was
an adept in such cases.</p>

<p>So he comes with the Sheriff and the Council and the knights
and barons of the town and they all gather round the poor
porter.</p>

<p>The priest exhorts the devil, who will give no answer; but,
the holy man in his agitation making a mistake in his Latin, the
devil suddenly speaks, in a heavy bass voice, and corrects him.
Thereupon follows this conversation, which one present put down
for the benefit of the curious.</p>

<p><i>Priest:</i> Who was he, and why was he annoying the poor
porter?</p>

<p><i>Diabolus:</i> They knew well enough who he was, and as for
why he was there that was no concern of theirs. Let the holy man
mend his Latin. <i>Priest:</i> Insolent answers would not help
him; depart he must and should.</p>

<p><i>Diabolus:</i> That was a fine tale. Evidently the holy man
was stupid as well as ignorant.</p>

<p>Thereupon the priest recited certain prayers that caused the
devil to run in anger about the body of the poor porter till it
seemed that the flesh must be torn from the bones.</p>

<p><i>Priest:</i> Did these prayers annoy him?</p>

<p><i>Diabolus:</i> Yes, certainly they did.</p>

<p><i>Priest:</i> Well, would he answer a few questions and then
depart?</p>

<p><i>Diabolus:</i> What questions?</p>

<p><i>Priest:</i> Where did he come from?</p>

<p><i>Diabolus:</i> Where the lean priest and the fat Sheriff
were going.</p>

<p><i>Priest:</i> Let him be civil or the prayers would begin.
Were there any witches in this town?</p>

<p><i>Diabolus:</i> Yes, there was one in church now.</p>

<p>Then Ottilia began to weep and cry out how the ugly devil
belied even a poor pious woman like herself; but the Sheriff and
the knights and barons looked pale.</p>

<p><i>Priest:</i> Would he tell them the others?</p>

<p><i>Diabolus:</i> No.</p>

<p>He then proceeded to sing a love-song in Dutch, to the great
scandal of Georges Potsdammer, a worthy knight and the only one
who understood that language, and on the priest asking him what
he sang he answered: a hymn, and began to mock the holy man in a
horrid way.</p>

<br>

<br>

<p><i>Priest:</i> He had better depart, or they would begin the
prayers again.</p>

<p><i>Diabolus:</i> Well, let them give him something.</p>

<p><i>Priest:</i> What did he want?</p>

<p><i>Diabolus:</i> The great fat man with the red nose and the
diamond agrafe in his cap.</p>

<p><i>Priest:</i> That was the Sheriff, and why did he want
him?</p>

<p><i>Diabolus:</i> He annoyed him.</p>

<p><i>Priest:</i> How could he annoy him? He might have the
agrafe of jewels, but not the Sheriff.</p>

<p><i>Diabolus:</i> Very well, then, they might pray as they
liked, they would not move him.</p>

<p>Which proved to be true. For they might pray as much as they
liked, they could not pray the devil out of the porter.</p>

<p>So presently up gets Ottilia and away she goes out of the
church, so that everyone turns to look at her, she muttering the
while that this was a holy man indeed who was not able to pray
the devil out of her poor porter; but as for her she had never
thought that he could, not he&mdash;holy indeed! why, there were
those who could tell a different tale!</p>

<p>So off goes my hag straight to where old Trina is busy making
cheeses, and in she comes without as much as knocking.</p>

<p>And never a word she says at first, but looks round the room,
and, sure enough, there were the two new broom-sticks lying
crossed under the table and by the cupboard sits Master Cat
looking as demure as you please and daintily licking the drops of
grease off the ends of his fur!</p>

<p>Ottilia started shrieking.</p>

<p>She perceived that Trina was a witch and she had sent a devil
into her poor porter because the fellow had resented her rudeness
yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Trina:</i> Witch indeed! How dare she say so, and what did
she know of it?</p>

<p><i>Ottilia:</i> What of the broom-sticks and the cat?</p>

<p><i>Trina:</i> She had bought broom-sticks herself only
yesterday, and what of the monkey in his little coloured
hose?</p>

<p><i>Ottilia:</i> Was it not to her credit that she tried to
make a Christian of the poor animal? Everyone knew that she was a
god-fearing, pious lady. But she had not come here to quarrel;
let Trina take the devil out of the porter and give her the
cheese and the dish of butter, and they might be good friends
again.</p>

<br>


<div align="center">
<img src="2300361h-images/SDS-4-002.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p><i>Trina:</i> She wanted no such friends; as for the cheeses,
they were seven for a florin, and at that price she might have
them.</p>

<p><i>Ottilia:</i> Seven a florin! She must be mad to speak so to
a high-born maiden!</p>

<p><i>Trina:</i> That was a good joke! Did she think she deceived
anyone with her brass chain rubbed up to look like gold, and her
old velvet gown turned and scoured a dozen times?</p>

<p>At this Ottilia was so enraged she snatched up the broomsticks
from under the table and began beating Trina; then up jumped the
black cat and ran between her ankles and tripped her up, and
Trina seized the broomsticks and drove her out of doors.</p>

<p>Back Ottilia went, muttering to herself and dancing along the
street so that everyone turned aside out of pure fright, and the
Sheriff, meeting her as he returned from the church, trembled all
over at the sight of her, and begged her to accept a vase of his
new honey.</p>

<p>"See that it is good measure," says she, with a leer, and she
hobbles back and finds the monkey by the kitchen fire, dipping
his hand in the kettle and picking out the best bits of the
stew.</p>

<p>At this she, further enraged, falls on him and beats him
without mercy.</p>

<p><i>Ottilia:</i> He was a worthless spirit! Could he not save
her porter&mdash;could he do nothing but eat and thieve?</p>

<p><i>Pipkin</i> (which was the name of this creature): That was
a powerful spell laid on the porter, but if she would stop
beating him he would suggest how she might have her revenge.</p>

<p>Ottilia ceased her blows and they whispered together, and
presently they began to laugh and dance, and, my knave from the
Sheriff coming with the vase of honey, looked in at the window
and seeing, as he declared, three tall shadows leaping up and
down on the wall, back he ran, honey and all, and swears he will
deliver no more messages there, no, not if the Sheriff was to dip
him in the river.</p>

<p>Now Trina gets ready her cheeses and goes to the market with
them. Everyone is looking grim, and the bell of the big church is
tolling, for the porter is just dead and the devil, in flying out
of the corpse, snatched up the altar-cloth and whirled it away
through the window, and it may be seen at this moment stuck on
the weathercock on the steeple.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2300361h-images/SDS-4-003.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>But my hag cheerfully sets out her cheeses, and presently the
people gather round, for the cheeses are large, fine and soft,
and indeed better than any ever seen in that town before.</p>

<p>And, sure enough, she does a good trade, and it seems as if
every cheese on the cart would be sold, when&mdash;what
happens?</p>

<p>Just as she is taking up the cheeses to hand them to her
customers, up they all jump, like live things, and start running
down the street.</p>

<p>Everyone stares and shrieks and crosses himself, and off go my
cheeses, one after the other&mdash;jump, jump, jump!&mdash;and
after them the hag screaming and cursing.</p>

<p>But she might do as she liked; it was no use, the cheeses
hurry along and she cannot keep up with them.</p>

<p>In and out of the long streets they go, out of the gate and
past Ottilia's farm.</p>

<p>And there she is at the window laughing and clapping her
hands, with the monkey on her shoulder.</p>

<p><i>Ottilia</i> She was well paid now for bewitching the poor
porter! She might run till she burst, she would never get her
cheeses again! Ha! ha! How strange she looked, with her skirts
all gathered up and her skinny legs looking like two sticks dried
in the sun!</p>

<p>But Trina took no notice; she ran after the cheeses. Only what
was the use?</p>

<p>They made straight for the river-bank, and there they jumped
into the water, one after the other&mdash;plump! plump!
plump!</p>

<p>And that was the end of the cheeses.</p>

<p>Now Ottilia and Pipkin had a feast, and because the Sheriff
had not sent the honey as he had promised, they put a spell on
him and turned all the beer in his cellar sour, and all the fish
and meat in his pantry bad, so that the smell turned the
Sheriff's stomach.</p>

<p>So he in a fright sent another knave with a venison and a
salmon and a great pot of honey; and what a feast my hag made!
All the afternoon she was frying collops and sausages and making
soup and boiling salmon.</p>

<p>Now, there were some friends of hers living near, hags like
herself, but afraid of her, and to these she sent a message
asking them to supper&mdash;for when she had good food she liked
to make a show of it, so as to set all talking of her luxury and
magnificence.</p>

<p>In came the hags dressed like so many young beauties, and down
they sat to the feast, flattering and praising Ottilia and
smirking and smiling at each other as if they were the sweetest-
tempered creatures in the world.</p>

<p>Well, just as my witch had brought in the salmon and set it on
the table and all the guests were ready to plunge in their knives
and forks, down comes the ceiling, spoils the feast, and nearly
kills them all!</p>

<p>The table was broken beneath the wooden beams, the venison,
the sausages, the salmon, the beer, the wine, the honey, were
scattered right and left, so that there was not one crumb fit to
eat.</p>

<p>Now the old women thought that this was some trick on the part
of Ottilia (for she had served them not a few in the past), and
as soon as they could escape from the ruins of the table they
rose up and went for her, beating her black and blue and swinging
Pipkin round by his tail and dashing his head against the wall,
she crying out the while that she was innocent and would she have
spoilt her own good dinner herself?</p>

<p>They never heeded a word, but beat her till they were tired;
then they blew out in a cloud, scolding and quarrelling among
themselves.</p>

<p>When they had gone, Ottilia, as soon as she could recover
herself, beat Pipkin a little more for not having been able to
prevent the falling in of the roof, then put on her best gown and
the famous brass chain and went off to find a man to put the roof
on again, then, as quick as she could, hobble, hobble, to the
Sheriff's.</p>

<p>Shivering and trembling, he bids her come in, though he is in
full council discussing no less an important thing than putting a
penny a quart on the price of beer.</p>

<p>In comes Ottilia demurely, and, sighing and weeping, she
starts her story.</p>

<p><i>Ottilia:</i> With the venison and salmon his lordship had
been so good as to send she had made a little feast for some poor
women of her acquaintance, and they, after thanking Heaven for
its mercies, were just sitting to table when down came the roof
and spoilt everything. This, like the death of the poor porter,
was plainly witchcraft, and she accused the strange Trina Von
Ebers, and called on the Sheriff to obtain justice for her and
damages from that accursed witch. To wit; <i>item</i>, for the
value of the porter, 50 florins; <i>item</i>, for the cost of a
new roof, 10 florins; <i>item</i>, for the cost of the dinner 5
florins; <i>item</i>, for a new gown totally spoilt by some soup
falling over it, 10 florins; and for another feast to compensate
her friends for their disappointment, 15 florins.</p>

<p>The Sheriff did not know what to answer; he was as white as
the wall behind him. He bit his thumb and looked at the
councillors, and the councillors looked at him, and they all
coughed and scratched their heads, and did not know what to
answer.</p>

<p>Then Ottilia began to frown and scream: What, were they not
there to see justice done on a high-born maiden in distress?</p>

<p>And the Sheriff hastily replied, yea, they were there to see
justice done, but could she prove the witchcraft? Might it not
have been an accident? And, as to the damages she claimed, they
did not think this stranger woman could disburse them.</p>

<p>So spoke the Sheriff out of fear of both witches, but Ottilia
became more wrathful than ever. Let them search the stranger's
house and see if they did not find money enough to satisfy her
claims! And, if they found nothing, let them take her out and
burn her for the witch she undoubtedly was!</p>

<p>At these words in walks old Trina leaning on a crutch, and
goes stumping straight up to the Sheriff and tells her tale of
the bewitched cheeses and demands that Ottilia be sent to the
rack until she confess it was her doing.</p>

<p>Then the Sheriff and the councillors wished that they had
never been born, for, whichever hag they decided for, the other
would destroy them with her spells, and the Sheriff saw no escape
for it but to die miserably, as the poor porter had died. So he
sat there, trembling and biting his thumb, while my witches glare
at each other awaiting his answer.</p>

<p>Then presently he thinks of a solution, and declares them both
pious women and innocent of all witchcraft, and suggests that
perchance there is some evil person in the town who has played
these ugly tricks, or else that they were no tricks at all, but
mere accidents.</p>

<p>Accidents! screams Ottilia, when he himself had heard the
devil speak from the mouth of her porter!</p>

<p>Accidents! cries Trina, when the cheeses had risen up like
Christians and run down the street&mdash;hop; hop; hop; and the
whole town had seen them!</p>

<p>So the Sheriff sighs and says, well, no doubt there was
witchcraft in it, and he can propose nothing but a witch-hunt,
and pray Heaven they may find the evil-doer.</p>

<p>Now, this is not at all to the liking of my hags, and they
stretch out their lean throats and scream out a protest, each
shrieking that the other is the witch and no need to search
further.</p>

<p>But the councillors are pleased with the Sheriff's plan, for,
think they, the excitement of a witch-hunt will help to reconcile
the people to the rise in the price of beer.</p>

<p>So off they hurry and find swords and sticks and bunches of
hazel tied with scarlet thread and make a proclamation of a
witch-hunt, to which all the town folk respond, well pleased.</p>

<p>And the two hags see nothing for it but to join in the chase,
the one with her monkey, the other with her cat, though their
wrath against each other was by no means abated, and both yet
hoped to serve the other some shrewd trick or turn that would
send her to the stake.</p>

<p>Now, while this chase was taking place through the streets,
the altar-cloth that had been fluttering from the weathercock of
the steeple where it had been blown by the devil to the great
scandal of all good Christians, suddenly fluttered down, though
there was no wind, and fell on the roof of a house in the High
Street, which the crowd at this minute were passing.</p>

<p>And the woman who lived there came running out, shouting:</p>

<p>Had any one heard the like? All the apple-trees in her garden
had become suddenly covered with fruit, and this but the middle
of May!</p>

<p>Now, this greatly pleased my knaves, who thought that they had
found magic at last; so they bundled the woman back into the
house and rushed into the garden, and there, sure enough, were
three little apple-trees, covered with red and glossy fruit; but
when one struck his teeth into them he found his mouth full of
ashes.</p>

<p>So here they had it at last, and some were for taking the
woman and burning her at once, but there were two objections;
<i>item</i>, she had a very good character, and earned her living
by knitting gloves for the priests; <i>item</i>, there was no one
among them who knew how to burn a witch, and the fellow they had
sent for had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>In the midst of all the delay and confusion and bawling and
fighting, two of the knaves start searching through the house for
broom-sticks, cauldrons, or any signs or mark of the Evil
One.</p>

<p>And what do they find?</p>

<p>A fair lame maiden, seated on the floor in one of the dusty
garrets.</p>

<p>And she could give no account of herself; so they dragged her
down before the Sheriff, and the housewife declared that she had
never seen her before, and that it was she, sure enough, who had
bewitched the apple-trees.</p>

<p>And my hags join in out of jealousy, seeing the girl is young
and comely, albeit lame, and swear this is the witch and no
other, and now they can have their witch-burning.</p>

<p>So off they all go&mdash;hurry, hurry, hurry&mdash;to the
market-place, and, the witch-burner having arrived, the stake is
prepared, and a fine bundle of green wood brought, and everyone
pleased and content at the thought of the holy and pleasant
spectacle, when what must Ottilia and Trina do but start anew to
quarrel, each telling the other she should join the poor maiden
at the stake.</p>

<p>And Pipkin and the cat begin fighting until it is an awful
sight; for as they fight they grow larger until the monkey is the
size of a soldier, and the cat the size of a bear.</p>

<p>Then, while every one is shivering and trembling, and not
knowing what to do, there comes a clap of thunder, and who should
step into the market-square but the Devil himself?</p>

<p>Now, fiends, imps, evil spirits, familiars, ghosts and witches
were well known to the good citizens, but the Devil himself was
quite another matter, and they all began to roar with fright.</p>

<p>To begin with, he was as tall as the cathedral, he had a tail
that lashed over the house-tops, and his long hair shook in the
sky like banners. So he puts one hoof in the market-place and
glances down with his red eyes, then he takes up the two witches
as a man might take up two hens and tucks them one under each
arm, and off he goes over the houses&mdash;stride, stride,
stride&mdash;and disappears with another clap of thunder.</p>

<p>And that was the end of my hags.</p>

<p>Now when the crowd had recovered its senses, the cat and the
monkey had disappeared, and there was the poor maiden weeping at
the stake. So they gave her her liberty; it seemed she was a poor
orphan hired to do a day's spinning, and her mistress had denied
her for fear. She afterwards married George Potsdammer; so this
was a lucky day for her after all.</p>

<p>Now, everyone was satisfied, save the witch-burner, who said:
how was he to be paid?</p>

<p>But the Sheriff was so pleased to be rid of Ottilia that he
paid the fellow the same, and so all went to a feast in the town-
hall.</p>

<p>Alas, they might well feast! Soon it appeared that the devil
had let Ottilia loose again, and back she came in a new fur
tippet; but that is not in this tale.</p>

<p>Here ends the story of the Magister, and the next pages of
this manuscript deal with a plan for conversion of the Jews and
an account of Benedict D'Arles, who spent thirty years trying to
produce the Philosopher's Stone from decayed hen's-eggs, mercury
and seaweed, and died mad.</p>

<p class="first">HE winter sun, pale and clear as thrice-refined
gold, warmed the rich countryside which lay beneath the Convent;
the pine trees with fox-red cones, the thick olive trees with the
clustering grey fruit, the chest nuts heavy with tawny foliage,
covered the hill-slopes to where they joined the valleys, divided
by silver-stemmed larches and slender poplars, bearing a few last
leaves, flat and bright as a gipsy's sequins, into fields where
men, women and oxen worked, turning over the fresh brown
earth.</p>

<p>On the roofs of the farmhouses figs were drying in flat
baskets; from the doors and windows hung the red gold strings of
maize; and in the gardens, by the stone wells or the marble
shrines of the Madonna set in the wall, the orange trees showed
the dark glossy foliage and the brilliant fruit.</p>

<p>The wine harvest was over; in the stone courtyards sat girls
and children rapidly fashioning covers for the flasks from the
dried stems and leaves of the maize; the laurels were covered
with berries, scarlet, purple and green; and here and there in
some sheltered garden a white or crimson rose blossomed on the
same stem as the vivid yellow fruit.</p>

<p>Through this winter landscape rode a young lord with a sin on
his soul; he rode to the Convent. In his furred habit, with
tassels of scarlet, he went humbly through the cloisters where
the slanting sunlight lay, and confessed to Father Aloysius. And
though the good monk absolved him, he was still uneasy, for his
sin was a grievous one.</p>

<p>"How can it be?" he cried, "that I shall be forgiven?"</p>

<p>Then Father Aloysius took him by the hand and led him into the
garden.</p>

<p>It was very still; above the low line of the cloisters tine
insects crossed each other in the blue sky; there was just breeze
enough to rustle the shining leaves of the lemon trees that
drooped heavy fruit against the wall.</p>

<p>"There is no sin," said the monk, "too heinous to be forgiven,
if one truly repents. As witness the tale of the hangman of Pisa,
which is out of the book called <i>The Rosarie of Our Lady</i>,
wherein are other examples, there being one for each bead on the
rosary.</p>

<p>"Now this hangman was a wicked and bitter man, who had never
done a good action in his life, but had taken up his awful trade
for pleasure in it and would go to a hanging as merrily as a maid
to a dancing. There was no one who loved him or respected him or
pitied him; never was he seen in a church, nor any holy place,
and when some poor wretch, about to die under his hand, would
murmur a prayer for God's pity, my hangman would laugh and scoff
in a way horrid to hear.</p>

<p>"It happened one day that he was going forth to hang an
offender; he was clothed in the garments of the men he had
executed, and he carried a rope in his hand, for there was need
of a new one for the gallows.</p>

<p>"It was a sweet and lovely day in spring, the flowers were
blowing in the gardens and on the hillsides, and many people were
singing because of the pleasant season of the year.</p>

<p>"The hangman felt suddenly uneasy: for the first time in his
wicked life he noticed how the children and the young maidens ran
away when they saw him coming, how the men crossed to the other
footway, so that his path was always lonely.</p>

<p>"And for the first time since he had begun his present horrid
occupation, he thought of the poor prisoner whom he was going to
hang.</p>

<p>"When he came to Pisa bridge, where is the shrine of the
Virgin set into the wall, a child running from him dropped a
cluster of wood-violets. And the hangman, on the impulse, picked
up the flowers and placed them on the little shelf before the
Virgin, and at the same time commended his soul to Our Lady.</p>

<p>"Then he went on his way again, hurt, passing through a narrow
street, he was intercepted by some relations of the man he was
going to hang, and they slew him.</p>

<p>"Now there was then in Pisa a certain priest who nightly
walked about every church in the city, and that night he rose up
and went to the church of Our Lady.</p>

<p>"And as he passed through the churchyard, he saw a great many
dead men gathered together in a company.</p>

<p>"Some of these dead men he knew, and of them he asked what was
the matter.</p>

<p>"And one of them answered, 'The hangman is slain, and the
Devil challenges his soul from Our Lady, who says it is hers; and
the Judge is even at hand coming hither to hear the cause, and
therefore,' said they 'we are now come together.'</p>

<p>"Then the priest thought that he also would be at this
hearing, and so hid himself behind a thorn tree, and anon saw the
judicial seat prepared and furnished, whereon the judge, to wit,
St. Michael, sat, and near him was Our Lady.</p>

<p>"Soon after, the devils brought in the soul of the hangman
pinioned, and they proved by good evidence that he belonged to
them.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, Our Lady pleaded for this poor wretch,
contending that he at the hour of death commended his soul to
her, and laid a bunch of violets before her shrine on Pisa
bridge.</p>

<p>"St. Michael, hearing the matter so well debated on either
side, willing to obey Our Lady's desire, and yet loath to do the
devils any wrong, gave sentence that the hangman's soul should
return to his body, and by his future conduct should his fate be
decided; he further ordered that the Pope should set forth a
public form of prayer for the hangman's soul.</p>

<p>"Thereupon the devils demanded who should do this errand to
His Holiness?</p>

<p>"'Why,' said Our Lady, 'yonder priest who lurketh behind the
thorn tree.'</p>

<p>"So the priest was called forth, and the message given him,
which he did accept, saying however, 'By what token shall I
persuade His Holiness?'</p>

<p>"Then Our Lady took a rose from her girdle and delivered it
him, saying, 'This shall be the token whereby ye may desire the
Pope to take the pains to do as has been decreed.'</p>

<p>"So the soul of the hangman returned to his body, and the
priest went to Rome, and when the Pope saw the freshnessd
freshness of the rose after it had been three days in the
priest's wallet, he knew that the story was true, and he ordered
prayers to be sent up for the recovered hangman.</p>

<p>"And the hangman so lived in holiness that when he died those
about him very plainly heard the opening of heaven's door to
admit his soul.</p>

<p>"By which you see," added Father Aloysius, "that one simple
prayer and a handful of flowers were sufficient to save the soul
of a wicked man."</p>

<p>At which the young lord rejoiced, and went away comforted.</p>

<p>But a certain voting novice, seeing him depart in his finery,
envied him, saying, "Look at his furred boots and his tassels,
and the hat with the heron's feather, and the chain and the beryl
stone!"</p>

<p>Father Aloysius heard him and rebuked him:</p>

<p>"That man whom you envy," said he, "is fallen so low that he
considered himself lost until I comforted him with the tale of
the great mercy vouchsafed to the hangman of Pisa.</p>

<p>"He takes no pleasure in his hat or his feather, in his furred
boots, nor in his chain with the beryl stone: therefore be not
envious of this splendour of his. And I would further remind you
that Envy or <i>Invidia</i> is the fifth of the Deadly Sins."</p>

<p>Now several of the novices who were about under the lemon
trees, picking the fruit and piling it into deep wand baskets,
began to dispute and complain about the dictum.</p>

<p>For envy (said they) could by no means be called a deadly sin,
only a venial one, for what harm could come of it to
anyone&mdash;either to the object envied or to the person who
envied?</p>

<p>Neither could this sin be considered the beginning of other
sins, or the root of evil, as were Pride, Greed, Wrath.</p>

<p>Besides, it was a failing common to all, and by no means to be
subdued save by a saint or hermit, and even these had been known
to envy the angels in heaven.</p>

<p>Thereupon Father Aloysius seated himself on the edge of the
well, where he had the sun, and expounded the fifth deadly sin,
which some, he said, put second, as next to Pride and before
Greed and Wrath.</p>

<p>And after this manner he expounded:</p>

<p>St. Augustine saith, "Envy is sorrow of other men's weal, and
joy of other men's woe;" and that is a true definition.</p>

<p>It is a very horrible sin (said the Father), inasmuch as it
goes secretly and is very often undiscovered, so escaping among
the ignorant, such as ye, as a venial fault hardly to be noticed,
when instead it is the generator of more evil in the world than
three of the other sins put together.</p>

<p>And I tell ye this, though there may be many a good or brave
man, tinct in some way with the other sins, yet there was never
one that had a spark of virtue in him who was a prey to envy; for
it is properly a sin of mean, small, creeping souls who lack the
courage for lustier vice.</p>

<p>Envy is one and the same with Malice, which it is sometimes
called it is against all virtue and all goodness, and it is like
the Devil, inasmuch as it rejoices at the harm which befalls
mankind. It is the parent of backbiting, detraction, slander,
false witness, scandal, unkindness and cruelty.</p>

<p>So great a sin is it that it is mentioned in the Ten
Commandments, which say nothing of Pride, nor Greed, nor
Avarice.</p>

<p>It goes against God when it complains of God's orderings, as,
the pains of hell, or poverty, or loss of cattle, or rain, or
tempest, all of which ills man should suffer patiently, for they
come from God's own hand.</p>

<p>And Envy is cowardly, and dare not openly show its face, but
murmurs and grumbles and complains and detracts privately; and
these secret mutterings of Envy are termed the Devil's <i>Pater
Noster</i>, though the Devil never had a <i>Pater Noster</i>, but
lewd folk so call this sour whispering of Envy.</p>

<p>And from Envy come rancour, and grudging, and bitterness of
heart, and discord, and false witness, and malignity.</p>

<p>And it is the most difficult sin of all to fight, for it goes
generally cloaked in the semblance of some virtue.</p>

<p>And there is this tale to be told of Envy, though there are
many others more pointed and dreadful; but this I know to be
true:</p>

<p>It happened in a far country, where there is much snow and
little sun, many clouds and few flowers.</p>

<p>There the hills are so high that one may walk all day through
the valleys, and never see the sun, though it be never so
brightly shining. There are great waterfalls and ravines and
lonely stretches of rock; and the land is mostly barren, for they
find there neither gold nor silver mines, nor marble quarries nor
any natural riches; nor does any fruit flourish nor any grain
save that little they painfully grow on the shelves of rocks. But
in the lakes and bays are plenty of fish, and there are vast
forests of pine, of which they sell the wood.</p>

<p>In this country is a castle, the most considerable they have,
close to their largest town. They call it the Blue Tower because
it is built of wood and painted blue; they use neither brick nor
marble in their building, but of wood they can make anything, a
delicate toy for a child or a ship that will sail over the
world's seas.</p>

<p>They are a rude people, strong and fair, and still barbarous
in their ways; they have no arts save those of embroidery and
carving, and their sole poetry is a number of wild, fierce songs
they sing in the evenings round the fire; it is said that many of
them are not even Christians, but still devoted to heathen
idols.</p>

<p>However this may be, they are cruel and brave in war, and dart
out on their icy seas in their dragon-prowed galleys and seize
any luckless ship that may be in their waters.</p>

<p>And there is the excuse to be made for their godless conduct
that they have a hard and bitter life in their cold and barren
land.</p>

<p>In this Blue Tower lived a certain nobleman with his daughter.
They were very rich for that country, and would drive to and fro
the town in a sledge with scarlet cushions and silver bells,
drawn by four reindeer, with little gold tips to their horns; and
there was always plenty of meat on their table, even in the
scarce seasons, and plenty of mead in their horn goblets, a great
fire burning always on their hearth, hangings of gaily worked
woollens and coloured lamps in their chambers, and on the lady's
arms bracelets of rough gold, and in her ears pendants of
turquoise.</p>

<p>They were, besides, much loved by their people, for they were
open-handed and gay, and brave and just and kindly.</p>

<p>Among their peasants was one named Frithiof, who was good and
intelligent, and clever indeed at the wood-carving in which these
people excelled; he could take a little bit of rough wood and
turn it into the likeness of a flower, or a face, or a bird, or a
toad, or a witch, or a fairy, while he drove the reindeer to
their stables.</p>

<p>And his master encouraged him, buying his work and praising
it, and at last ordered him to carve him a chair to sit in on
feast-days, a chair deep and high, with the old heroes they sang
of after supper carved on the back, an inch deep in the good
thick wood.</p>

<p>Now when Frithiof heard this it was to him as if all the
little silver sledge-bells were ringing in his heart, for he was
in love with a maiden named Rieke, and she loved him, and the
price of the chair would he sufficient wherewith to build a house
and buy a piece of ground, and perhaps even a reindeer, and so
they could be married before the winter was over.</p>

<p>His lord knew of this ambition of his, and favoured it, and
showed him the piece of land waiting for him, and his daughter
declared she would give the bride a square of scarlet cloth for a
wedding present; and Frithiof heard the silver bells ring louder
in his heart, and saw the cold northern sky rosy with hope.</p>

<p>Now Rieke was a very lovely maiden, with thick pale yellow
hair, which hung to her knees, and blue eves like the little
flowers which grow up in the snow-hills, and are put there by the
angels to remind men of God in desolate places.</p>

<p>She was pious, too, and industrious; she could comb and card
wool, spin and dye cloth, fashion garments and embroider them,
milk the reindeer and harness them, make caps and purses and
gloves and bags out of fur.</p>

<p>But withal she was of a discontented and jealous mind, and
though she truly loved Frithiof, she never saw him in his good
rough garments but she was shamed in her heart and wished that
she had a finer lover.</p>

<p>And when he came and told her of his good fortune with the
chair he was to carve for his lord, she was not so pleased as he
had thought she would he, and she sighed to herself, saying,
"This is not a grand future: a few yards of ground and a hut."
And in secret she filled her heart with all the old legends and
tales in which maidens had come to marry great knights by reason
of their fair faces.</p>

<p>So the winter came, and the world was white and silent with
snow; it lay on the ground, on the boughs of the fir trees, on
the mountains and on the ice that covered the lakes and bays, on
the roof of the Blue Tower, and on the roofs of all the little
huts beneath.</p>

<p>And as Rieke sat at her door, spinning, wearing a red gown and
a blue apron and cross cloths of yellow and red on her head, she
saw the lord's daughter driving in her sledge through the
forest.</p>

<p>She was going to some feast, for it neared Christmastide, and
she wore, plainly visible beneath her fur mantle, a white
vesture.</p>

<p>Now she, being a gracious lady and seeing Rieke working at her
door, stopped her sledge and entered the hut and spoke kindly to
the girl about the wedding drawing so near.</p>

<p>And as she stood talking in the warm room, she put back her
mantle, and Rieke saw the white gown, pure as the snow, with
white fur on the bodice, buckled with rough pearls; and she
heeded nothing of what the lady said, but thought only of the
white gown; and when she had gone, tinkle, tinkle with her
reindeer over the snow, Rieke sat down and wept.</p>

<p>"I should look fairer than she in a white robe," she thought,
"for I have yellow hair and hers is dark&mdash;but no one will
ever give me such a gown."</p>

<p>So she lamented until the devils of discontent and envy and
malice and jealousy got hold of her, and when Frithiof came to
her that evening, flushed and happy from his work, she received
him sullenly.</p>

<p>As he sat by the fire and her old mother told them fairy
tales, he carved her a necklet of the blue mountain flowers, so
delicately done that at a breath they trembled like living
petals.</p>

<p>But Rieke put it about her white neck sadly, and thought of
the fine chains the lord's daughter had worn, of pure gold, seven
times round her throat, and then hanging to her knees.</p>

<p>And as the days went on she became more and more gloomy and
distracted, and took no pleasure in Frithiof's eager talk of the
home they would have, nor her mother's gossip of the wedding
feast, of the mead the good lord would send, and the piece of
scarlet cloth that was to be the gift from his daughter; for
every day she longed more and more for the white gown, and when
they spoke of the dancing there would be, she looked at her rough
shoes and thought, "How can I dance in these?"</p>

<p>Now there was a certain neighbour of hers, named Helva, who
owned a pair of shoes made of soft skin and laced with silk, and
on Rieke once telling her how she envied them she pleasantly
promised to lend them for the wedding.</p>

<p>"But what is the use," thought Rieke, "of fine shoes, if I
have to go in a coarse coloured gown?"</p>

<p>And she became so pale and ill and sad that Frithiof, full as
he was of his own joy, could not fail to notice it, and often
demanded of her what the grief was; but she put him off, since
she was ashamed to tell.</p>

<p>But one evening he came to her, happy and singing, with the
price of the chair in his pocket, and she could bear it no more,
but broke into tears and told him how she longed for a white
gown.</p>

<p>And Frithiof went out into the snow and looked up at the stars
above the pine trees and tried to understand.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

</div>
<br>

<p>He loved her, therefore he could give her no blame; he only
realised that he had gold in his pocket, and that she was weeping
for a white gown. So he sighed, and sighed, and presently went to
a neighbour and borrowed his sledge and drove to the town.</p>

<p>And there he went to a merchant's and bought a white gown with
fur and rough pearl buckles, and the price of it was the gold he
had got foci the chair, and his savings besides, so that all the
long labour of days and nights and months and years went in this
flimsy piece of finery.</p>

<p>But Frithiof did not care; they could wait for the wedding and
the house as long as he could make her gay and joyous with his
gift.</p>

<p>And gay and joyous she was when he brought it to her; she
kissed him, she danced and sang, and cared nothing when he told
her their wedding must be postponed, for he must go back to his
work again to earn the money for the house and the piece of land
and the reindeer.</p>

<p>So he went away and took a great block of wood and began
hopefully to carve a dragon for the prow of a ship, the which he
hoped to sell to the shipbuilders who were getting ready new
ships for the spring.</p>

<p>But Rieke thought of nothing save the white gown. She did not
like to show it to her mother, because she had a kind of shame in
the possession of anything so costly; but late one afternoon,
just before it came to the time of candle-lighting, she crept up
to her room, slipped out of her red and blue clothes, and put on
the white gown.</p>

<p>Alas, there was no mirror on the rough pine walls, so Rieke
could not admire herself; but she combed out her long yellow hair
and shook it over her shoulder, and fingered the texture of the
gown and admired the way the silver border rippled over the
floor.</p>

<p>But her coarse shoes spoilt all, and she thought that she
would go to Helva and borrow the fine slippers, at the same time
making a show of the white gown before her friend, to whom she
wanted to say, "See what a fine lover I have! He went into the
town and bought me this gown!"</p>

<p>So she stole softly downstairs and out into the snow. It was
very cold, and heavy grey clouds were coming up over the hills,
but Rieke thought she could get to Helva's and back before the
storm came, and she put on no cloak, for she had none worthy of
such a gown.</p>

<p>Hurrying she went over the snow. It was beginning to get dark,
shadows lay blue beneath the pines, and the girl's breath showed
frozen before her; shivering with cold and panting with running
she came to Helva's cottage.</p>

<p>Impatiently she knocked at the door, crying, "Come, Helva, and
see my new gown!"</p>

<p>But there was no answer, nor any light coming from the
window.</p>

<p>"Come quick," cried Rieke, "for the storm is hastening over
the trees. It is getting dark, and I have no mantle!"</p>

<p>Then, as there was still no answer, she raised the latch and
entered.</p>

<p>And she beheld Helva's mother and little sister weeping, and
they took no notice at all of her attire.</p>

<p>"Helva is dead," they said, and Rieke bowed her head and wept
with them.</p>

<p>Yet she could not help secretly wondering what had become of
the fine silk-sewn slippers.</p>

<p>And presently she went into the bedchamber to say farewell to
her friend.</p>

<p>And there lay Helva, smiling, on the clean sheets, and on her
feet were the shoes.</p>

<p>Now Rieke began to envy the dead.</p>

<p>"What are the shoes to her?" she thought. "She does not need
them in her grave; if she had been alive she would have given
then to me, and it is foolish for these shoes to be lost in the
corruption of the earth when I need them."</p>

<p>And so, from envy and jealousy of the dead, she came to a more
dreadful thing.</p>

<p>She slipped the shoes off Helva's feet and hid them in her
bosom, and ran out of the cottage.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2300361h-images/SDS-5-002.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>The sky was now dark and the twilight fast descending, but at
the edge of the wood Rieke stopped and took off her shoes and put
on the fine slippers, already cold from the cold flesh of the
dead; and as she put them on she shivered to her heart.</p>

<p>And she began to be afraid.</p>

<p>"Just for to-night," she said; "to-morrow I will give them
back."</p>

<p>Now she was dressed like the lord's daughter, but she was
cold&mdash;ah, cold!</p>

<p>She wrapped her hair round her shoulders to keep herself warm,
and she tried to hurry, but her limbs were too stiff to move
swiftly, and the storm came up, and the snow began to fall in
great flakes, softly, softly, softly.</p>

<p>When she reached home she saw the cottage lights fall
cheerfully across the night; eagerly she knocked and cried to
them to admit her, quick, quick! But her mother looked from the
window, and seeing the white figure crouching outside she said,
"This is not my daughter Rieke, this is a ghost or witch. My
daughter Rieke is up at the Blue Tower helping the maids card
wool;" and she closed the shutters and bolted the door.</p>

<p>And Rieke cried and lamented outside in the falling snow, and
darkness, and the keen wind which shook the pines.</p>

<p>And when she saw that her mother would not open she turned
away to Frithiof's cottage, and rapped with her frozen knuckles
on the lattice. Frithiof was seated gazing into the red roses of
the fire, and dreaming of the days when Rieke would sit beside
him during the long winter evenings.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2300361h-images/SDS-5-003.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>Then, while he carved, she would spin, and they would tell
each other tales of the long ago, of dragons, salamanders, elves,
witches and fairies, and great heroes in gold armour.</p>

<p>And he counted up once more on his fingers how long it would
take him to earn enough for their wedding, and while he counted
he heard the tap, tap, tap at the window, and presently a voice
crying, "Let me in, let me in!"</p>

<p>So he hurried to open the door and look out into the night,
and out of the snowstorm came Rieke, chilling the room with her
cold presence.</p>

<p>And she was all white, save for the long strands of her wet
yellow hair.</p>

<p>And Frithiof brought her to the fire, and besought her to
speak to him; but she could say never a word more, for she was
frozen to the heart.</p>

<p>Wet and chilly was the white gown, wet and chill the thin
shoes; the bitter snowflakes melted on her cheeks and clung like
a wreath about her hair; and though Frithiof kissed her and put
his warm cheeks next hers, he could bring no life into her; and
though he brought hot mead, he could not force it between her
blue lips.</p>

<p>So he wrapped her up in his fur coat, and set her before the
fire, and ran out to fetch her mother and the neighbours.</p>

<p>But what was the use of their hurrying with their possets and
their blankets?</p>

<p>Rieke was dead in her garments of ice, dead and cold, cold as
the flying snow outside.</p>

<p>And they found that her feet were bare, so believed she had
lost her shoes; and when they came to put Helva in her grave they
found the fine slippers on her feet as if they had never been
disturbed, which is a matter the good angels know of, surely.</p>

<p>So Frithiof never carved the dragon prow for the shipbuilders;
of the wood he made a coffin for Rieke, and she was laid in it in
the white gown, and on the day before Christmas buried in the
little church on the hill-side.</p>

<p>And Frithiof went away from there, no one knowing what he did
with his days, though it is believed he wandered much and died a
monk in Syria.</p>

<p>But the chair with the price of which he bought the white gown
may still be seen in the great hall of the Blue Tower, and though
it is a little eaten by the worms and the rats, you may still
discern the old heroes carved in the good black wood.</p>

<p>Now I might tell you many more stories of Envy&mdash;as that
of the man who envied his neighbour who had the ceiling of his
dining-hall covered with gold pieces, and at last did his own in
like fashion; but as he was not rich, he used gilded lead, and
one day as he was carving the meat, down fell a false piece of
eight and killed him; or the lady who envied her brother's wife
for her small waist, and drew in her own so tightly that she
died; or the man who out of malice bore witness to a forgotten
crime of his neighbour's, and so discovered one of his own for
which he ended his life in prison; or the thieves who envied each
other's share of the booty and quarrelled so loud they were all
apprehended and justly hanged; or the maid who swore evil things
of another, and was ducked as a witch for coming by such secret
knowledge of another's sins, which she could only have discovered
(they said) by the aid of the Devil; or the monk who envied the
abbot and spoke maliciously of him, and that day (being Friday)
was choked with a fish-bone; or the woman who envied the statue
of Our Lady for her jewelled crown, at which the lamp before the
shrine went out, and in the dark the woman fell and broke her
neck. But I have spoken enough of Envy and all the evil
consequences thereof, which I pray you heartily beware.</p>

<p>So the novices took up their baskets of lemons and carried
them into the Convent.</p>

<p class="first">&nbsp;CERTAIN Cardinal came to
stay at the Convent, and was entertained in a royal manner, as
befitted his rank; three weeks he lingered, putting the Convent
to great expense, and when he left he gave them no more than his
blessing, though they had expected at least a relic for the
Chapel and a pound of gold for themselves.</p>

<p>And this led Father Aloysius, who was sorely angered, to speak
of the sixth deadly sin, which is Avarice, or, in the classical
tongue, <i>Auaricia</i>, with which is included another sin, that
of <i>Coveitise</i>, of which Saint Paul saith: "The root of all
harm is <i>Coveitise</i>."</p>

<p>Which sin is different from Avarice in this, that
<i>Coveitise</i> is the unlawful longing for what one has not,
and Avarice is the longing to keep what one has without lawful
need and excuse.</p>

<p>And there is an Avarice of glory and science, as well as an
Avarice of cattle and treasure; an Avarice of things of the soul,
as well as of things of the body.</p>

<p>And he who is avaricious breaks the first commandment, which
is against false gods&mdash;as he who follows this sin makes many
false gods and worships them all, and never chances to lift his
eyes to where the only and one God sits enthroned; nay, he is
absorbed in his worldly good, and thinks of naught else until the
day the devil catches him by the neck, saving: "Ho, come you with
me!"</p>

<p>Neither shall it save him (said Father Aloysius) if he wear a
Cardinal's hat!</p>

<p>And further to impress over and above all these gathering
complaints (for all from the Abbot to the scullions were
murmuring against their visitor) the hideousness and evil
consequence of this sin, he brought out the book of the German
Magister, and read them this story:<br> <br></p>

<p>Further back in this book of mine I spoke of a certain
notorious witch named Ottilia,* who was carried off bodily by the
devil, and afterwards returned, wearing a new fur tippet, to the
great dismay of the townsfolk.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* See "Wrath," <a href="#ch12">Chapter IV.</a> in this e-book.]</p>

<p>But who dare say anything?</p>

<p>She had a very plausible story to tell; she said she had been
visiting an ancient aunt of hers, in a distant part of the
country, who had died recently, and who had left her (honest
woman that she was!) two cats, a bag of gold, and the fur
tippet.</p>

<p>As for that scene in the market square, when one ventured to
speak of it, she treated it all as a jest&mdash;that was a fine
tale indeed; it was quite clear that there were a good many
people with an evil conscience, when they imagined they saw
things like that!</p>

<p>So she went back to her beer-brewing and her sausage-making;
she had a new roof put on her house, and she bought some new
furniture and a blue velvet gown, and no one dared say aught,
though they all groaned and sighed at having her amongst them
again.</p>

<p>As for the cats, they were not like ordinary beasts, but had
large round heads and small bodies, and wore sad, dun-coloured
coats. One was called Guzzling Grizel, and the other Wait-on-
yourself; for the first was never happy save when eating, and the
second when asked a favour, however trifling, would always reply
'Wait on yourself.'</p>

<p>Now it was perfectly well known that these cats were nothing
better than imps who had taken the place of my Pipkin, who was
never seen again. Nor was Trina, the other witch, ever seen
again&mdash;and none dared ask after her.</p>

<p>So Ottilia lived quietly for a while, making her beer and her
sausages, and going to the market and selling them, sometimes
buying a broom and sometimes a bit of finery for herself or her
imps.</p>

<p>And one clay she was sitting by the fire after dinner when
there came a knock on the door.</p>

<p>So up she hobbled, ready with a sour word if it should he one
of my hags come to visit her; she sees instead a handsome young
man, very mournful and sad, so she begins smiling and saying all
the servants were abroad, and the porter asleep, as she also
would have been had she not stayed up to say her prayers. But
will he step inside and state his business?</p>

<p>My young man listens to all these lies very courteously, and
asks if she be the Lady Ottilia?</p>

<p>"Yes," says she, highly flattered; "come in, fair sir, and
taste my beer, which is better than any brewed around."</p>

<p>So he entered and sat by the fire and sighed and groaned.</p>

<p><i>She:</i> What was the matter with him that he seemed so
downcast? Let him taste her beer!</p>

<p><i>He:</i> He had not come for her beer, but for her advice;
for he was quite in despair, and he had heard she was very
wise.</p>

<p><i>She:</i> She believed she had as much sense as her
neighbours!</p>

<p><i>He:</i> Well, he was in trouble; let her help him, and she
should not back for her reward.</p>

<p><i>She:</i> She was willing to do her best as long as it was
not some silly love affair, for with such things she had no
patience!</p>

<p><i>He:</i> No, he had never been in love in his life, nor ever
seen a woman so pleasing to him as she was now, when she promised
to do her best for him!</p>

<p>At which Ottilia was mightily pleased, and told him he must
not think of trying to get round her with compliments, for she
was not a foolish girl, but a woman turned thirty, though she had
heard said she looked younger.</p>

<p>"Not a day more than twenty-five," said he; at which Guzzling
Grizel and Wait-on-yourself burst into laughter, and Ottilia
kicked them out of the room.</p>

<p><i>They:</i> She had some vigour in her still, though she was
seventy-seven yesterday!</p>

<p>At this Ottilia hoped he would excuse the poor beasts, who
were little better than heathen still, for all the trouble she
took with them.</p>

<p><i>He:</i> What did it matter? He was not such a good
Christian himself. If she would hear his trouble, it was
this:</p>

<p>He was a master mariner, and had made many sailing; in many
parts of the world, and seen many strange lands.</p>

<p>And ever since he was a little child one thought had tormented
him&mdash;why did the ships turn hack? Why not sail on and see if
there was not another land?</p>

<p>For his part, he believed there was, and that if they sailed
on through uncharted seas they would find this land: he had had
visions of it, he had dreamed of it, he believed it was very rich
and beautiful, with gold and silver mines; and the man who
discovered it could make himself king.</p>

<p>But for ten years he had wandered from one place to another,
to kings, to princes, to towns, to the Pope, to bishops and great
knights, and no one would believe in him sufficiently to give him
enough money to buy a boat and go in search of this New Country,
nay, not even if he offered half of what he found.</p>

<p>And worse than that, he had now lost his profession, for none
would trust him on their ship, for (said they) he was too crazed;
and he was now at his last penny, for he had spent all his
patrimony in his wanderings.</p>

<p>Therefore, finding himself in this town, and hearing of her
and her wisdom, he had come to ask her, first if there was such a
land as he dreamt of; second, if he should ever find it; third,
if she could help him to someone who would supply him with money
for the voyage.</p>

<p>On hearing this Ottilia took a long drink of beer, and then
sat staring into the fire.</p>

<p>At last she said she could do none of these things herself,
but if he would come with her to a friend of hers, she thought
that he might know everything, yea, and even get the help he
needed.</p>

<p>So he said, Yes, eagerly enough would he go with her, and
swear to give her a good share of whatever he got from this
venture.</p>

<p>So my hag takes a stout broomstick from the corner, and jumps
on it, and bids the young man mount behind, which he does; then
behind him climb the two imps (grumbling that they had scarcely
any room), and oft they go, up the chimney and over the town,
which lay dark below them, dotted with little twinkling
lights.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2300361h-images/SDS-6-001.gif"

<br>

<p>They flew over the houses and out into the open country, and
alighted on the top of a hill where a large company was already
gathered. A table was set in the middle, and on this stood a
great lantern, which gave forth an extraordinary light.</p>

<p>And all about were gathered men and women, or rather, as my
stranger soon perceived, witches and warlocks.</p>

<p>On a high chair in the centre sat a man in a black coat with a
blue band, and when he rose to welcome Ottilia, my stranger
noticed that he wore hoggers (<i>i.e.</i> high boots without
feet), and that he had goat's hoofs, so that now he had no doubt
at all about the character of the company.</p>

<p>The Devil (for it was no other) received him very civilly, and
took off the broad-lipped hat he wore (they were that year the
fashion), and saluted him and asked him his name.</p>

<p>Now my master mariner was in some doubts whether he should
speak to a person obviously excommunicated, but nevertheless
answers that his name was Felipe Lopez.</p>

<p>"Very well," says the fiend, "as it is the etiquette here to
call everyone by a different name from that they have been
baptised with, I will call you Goodman Tib;" and under this name
he was introduced to the company.</p>

<p>So they all took their seats; the feast was well enough, but
everything was eaten without salt, for that mineral, being an
emblem of eternity, is forbidden to lost souls.</p>

<p>Now, seated on the right hand of the Devil was a very well
favoured witch, and on his left one hardly less comely, and my
stranger, Don Lopez, perceived that Ottilia was not at all
pleased with this arrangement, but kept up an envious grumbling
that the best place should have been hers.</p>

<p>In the middle of the feast the Devil calls for all the
screaming and gossiping to cease, and asks Don Lopez what he
wants with him.</p>

<p>Whereupon the other musters his courage and tells his
story.</p>

<p>So the Devil reflects a little and presently he speaks.</p>

<p><i>Devil:</i> If he helped Goodman Tib to find this New
Country, would he promise him to deliver it over to his (Satan's)
worship, excluding all priests, monks, nuns and everything in the
shape of a cross, even to a pair of scissors?</p>

<p><i>Don Lopez:</i> That was an unreasonable condition to make,
for everyone knew that if he did any such thing he would be
seized and burnt outright!</p>

<p><i>Devil:</i> If he was tender in his conscience, why had he
come here for help?</p>

<p><i>Don Lopez:</i> It wasn't a question of conscience at all,
but of common sense; he was quite willing to serve the Devil
secretly.</p>

<p><i>Devil:</i> No, he was tired of secret worship; he wanted
churches and priests and everything like God had.</p>

<p><i>Don Lopez:</i> That was quite impossible, as he ought to
know by now.</p>

<p>And Ottilia leant across to him, and whispered to never mind
Old Nick. "Black Tom is in a bad humour," says she; "take no
notice of him!"</p>

<p>Upon which the Devil starts up in a fury, and seizing a leg of
meat comes flourishing it over his head.</p>

<p><i>Devil:</i> Had he not forbidden them to speak of him in
that way? Were they not always to call him Lord, Master, and
Majesty? And here was she referring to him as Old Nick and Old
Black Tom! Ah, he well knew the reason: it was because she had
not had the best place at table, which she never would have
again!</p>

<p>At this, seeing him so enraged, all the witches and warlocks
began to mumble and whimper in fright, save Ottilia, who answered
him roundly, and when he would have dashed out her brains with
the leg of meat, she gave him a blow with her broomstick that
sent him reeling, and then mounted her broomstick, pulled up Don
Lopez and the imps behind her, and sailed away haughtily, for
(said she), "These feasts are not what they used to be; now one
never knows who will be there, and Old Black Tom himself is
losing his manners."</p>

<p>On hearing her use this expression again, Don Lopez looked
back fearfully.</p>

<p>But the Devil seemed already to have forgotten them, and was
dancing on the table in the shape of fire-halls, a favourite
diversion of his, which he performed very elegantly.</p>

<p>Now Don Lopez felt naturally dismal, but Ottilia took a
cheerful view.</p>

<p>There was (she said) a certain king who was famed for his
great wealth, and though he was very close with it, there were
good hopes that he might part with a little of it in such an
investment as this, which promised him his money back a hundred-
fold; he ruled in an island in the West, about three days'
journey away.</p>

<p><i>Don Lopez:</i> It was all very well to talk, but how was he
to get the money for another three days' journey? He was already
at his last white piece.</p>

<p><i>Ottilia:</i> Let him have patience and she would help him;
she had taken a liking to him, and she believed in his ideas;
only let him promise her half of what he found, and all would be
well.</p>

<p>So he promised, and she set him down at his doorstep, and off
she flew home, whisk, whisk, whisk, through the air as if she
were trying to sweep up the stars.</p>

<p>And when she got home she made some hot supper, and when she
had fed my cats she asked them how they should find money to send
the young man on his way.</p>

<p>Wait-on-yourself was, as always, discouraging; said they had
better keep any money they could find for themselves instead of
wasting it on the first knave who asked for it; but Guzzling
Grizel suggested that they should ask the Sheriff to lend them
the amount, and Ottilia, who was quite ready to plague her old
victim, said it was a fine suggestion.</p>

<p>So the next morning off she goes to the Town Hall, arrayed in
her new blue gown and fur tippet, and pops in on the Sheriff, and
asks him to lend her five hundred thalers.</p>

<p>Now the Sheriff was as much afraid of her as ever, but he did
not know where to get five hundred thalers, as he had lately made
a purchase of some wine trees, which he was having planted in his
garden, and as these had cost a great deal he had no money to
spare.</p>

<p>Besides, he thought, if she was going to begin to demand
money, a stand might as well be made first as last.</p>

<p>So he refuses as politely as possible, and offers her sweet
wine and comfits, and sees her to the door in the most courtly
manner, and returns to the planting of his wine trees.</p>

<p>Now that night while he was in bed he heard a strange chanting
rising from beneath his window, and these were the words of
it:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">Perish, perish, soil and seed,<br>
Flower, leaf and fruit;<br>
Grow, grow, briar, weed,<br>
Nightshade and mandrake root.</p>

<br>

<p>So out he jumps from the bed, and there was an awful sight to
be seen in the moonlight! All the fair field where he had planted
his wine trees was being ploughed up, the little young trees lay
prone and dying, and up and down went the plough, which was drawn
by two hideous toads. The Devil himself was driving, while after
came a crowd of hags, led by Ottilia, leaping and capering, and
casting handfuls of seed into the deep ruts left by the plough
(by which it may be observed that my witch had made up her
quarrel with Satan).</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>My poor Sheriff groans and goes back to bed, and tries to
believe it is a dream; but no, next morning there are all the
wine trees withered, and the ground covered with great coarse,
rude weeds.</p>

<p>So he calls up the gardeners and tries to clear the ground;
but what was the use?</p>

<p>My weeds would by no means be moved, but put out their thorny
hands and flung down the gardeners, and used curses horrid to
hear; so my Sheriff, all in a tremble, runs off to Ottilia.</p>

<p><i>Sheriff:</i> He had changed his mind about the money; she
should have it as soon as he could find it. Meanwhile, she might
suggest something for his garden, which was clearly
bewitched!</p>

<p><i>Ottilia:</i> Let her have the money at once, and she would
see what she could do for his garden&mdash;though, let him mark,
she knew nothing about it!</p>

<p><i>Sheriff:</i> How was he to raise the money at once?</p>

<p><i>Ottilia:</i> He was very simple! Let him sell three links
of his great chain of office!</p>

<p><i>Sheriff:</i> But the chain did not belong to him, but to
the town!</p>

<p><i>Ottilia:</i> All the better for him; and he could put three
links of gilded lead in place of the others, and no one would be
any the wiser!</p>

<p><i>In summa</i>, the Sheriff sold the three links privately
for seven hundred thalers, five of which he sent to Ottilia, upon
which my weeds, who had been quarrelling and cursing like a
regiment of free lancers, disappeared in the night, and the
Sheriff put back the poor shivering wine trees.</p>

<p>Ottilia sent three hundred of the thalers to Don Felipe and
put the rest by for herself.</p>

<p>So Don Felipe hired a ship and sailed for that island in the
West.</p>

<p>And when he reached it he paid off his mariners, and put on
his silvered silk and went to the king.</p>

<p>He found him in a castle on a river, a quiet spot outside the
town; it was, in fact, a quiet country, where all things were of
a grey colour, and the people moved slowly.</p>

<p>There were no bright flowers and no rare fruits nor birds nor
beasts, hut there was plenty of good clothing and stout houses,
and everyone seemed to have a penny in his pocket.</p>

<p>But the king wore a cotton velvet gown, shabby and mean, a
little greasy hat, and shoes broken at the toes.</p>

<p>He sat under the apple trees, and by his side was the queen,
pale and homely, and darning hose.</p>

<p>And about the orchard played the seven princes in homespun
doublets and the seven princesses in linsey-woolsey kirtles; they
all had long noses and small eyes like the king, and red hair and
large mouths like the queen.</p>

<p>And though their father was the richest monarch in the world,
there was not one of them who had not a patch or a darn on his
garments or in his hose.</p>

<p>Now Don Felipe began to feel very dismal about the issue of
his mission, but he tried to disguise the lowness of his spirits,
and he gave the king an account of his project and his good hopes
of success.</p>

<p>His Majesty was intelligent, and he listened keenly, stroking
his long chin and closing his small eves; and when Don Felipe had
finished, he spoke thoughtfully, after this manner:</p>

<p><i>King:</i> It was a fine story, and if there was truth in
it, they might both be rich men; but he must think it over: it
would cost a great deal of money to send a ship, and supposing
after all it turned out a delusion? All the money would be lost,
and that was dreadful to think of.</p>

<p><i>Don Lopez:</i> His Majesty need not think of it, for it was
perfectly certain that the money would not be lost, but returned
a thousand-fold.</p>

<p><i>King:</i> Yes, he might <i>feel</i> certain, but where were
his proofs?</p>

<p><i>Don Lopez:</i> He had no proofs; let His Majesty risk the
money.</p>

<p><i>King:</i> He had never risked anything yet. However, let
him tell him what he would get if he gave the ship and the
expedition succeeded.</p>

<p><i>Don Lopez:</i> He would be king over the New Country, and a
quarter of the treasure found there.</p>

<p><i>King:</i> Those were miserable terms: he wanted all the
treasure.</p>

<p><i>Don Lopez:</i> That was impossible: half was promised
already to a certain lady who had helped him and was a very dear
friend of his.</p>

<p><i>King:</i> Well, he would think over it.</p>

<p>So he dismissed Don Lopez, giving him neither drop nor crust,
and began to talk over the matter with the queen.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was that he was on the verge of war
with another king who ruled a little island near his own, and a
bitter grief it had been to him to think of the gold he must
spend on this war, for though it was very certain he would
conquer his neighbour, still it was a poor little land, and would
not repay his expenditure: therefore how mighty convenient it
would be, could he but get this new land and the treasure! As for
Don Felipe demanding half of it, that was a mere jest; they could
easily find some way of disposing of <i>his</i> claims.</p>

<p><i>In summa</i>, they agreed that if they and the fourteen
princes and princesses went without butter and sugar and new
clothes for ten years, if they dismissed the Lord Chamberlain
(and Heaven knew how useless he was!) and did his work
themselves, they might make up for what they would have to expend
on the ship.</p>

<p>So the next day Don Felipe was sent for, and after much
bargaining he agreed to take five thousand pounds (as they call
the gold pieces in this country), wherewith to equip his
expedition, though he swore that it was not enough.</p>

<p>With many sighs and groans the king took up his keys and went
to his treasury, and unlocked one of the cases where his brave
gold was stored. But when he saw it there, fresh and bright and
smiling, and thought of counting out five thousand of these
darlings and handing them over to this stranger, his heart
utterly failed him; he hastily locked the casket and treasury and
hurried away, saying rudely that he had changed his mind.</p>

<p>Now Don Felipe was an angry man: he cursed the grey island and
the grey king with the long lip, and out he set for the little
country with whom my miser was going to war.</p>

<p>And when he reached the court of the neighbouring king he had
not a penny in his pocket, and he had sold his silvered silk for
his poke full of meal and a piece of flesh.</p>

<p>He found the king and all his courtiers roaring and shrieking
round a great table, and they all had jolly red faces, their
mouths full of meat and their hearts of kindness.</p>

<p>They made him welcome, they feasted him and toasted him, and
when he came to expound his theme, they all with one accord said
he should have the money.</p>

<p>So they went on drinking and singing until they could neither
drink nor sing, and so to bed, very contentedly.</p>

<p>But the next morning the monarch, being sober, sends for my
mariner.</p>

<p><i>King:</i> How were they to find the money? Himself he had
none. The very clothes he wore were not paid for.</p>

<p><i>Don Lopez:</i> He might borrow from the nobles.</p>

<p><i>King:</i> He had already; he had not left a white piece to
one of them. <i>Don Lopez:</i> There were always the Jews.</p>

<p><i>King:</i> He had squeezed them dry already.</p>

<p>So Don Lopez could think of nothing more to say, and they sat
staring at each other dismally.</p>

<p>Then in came the courtiers and turned their pockets out and
racked their brains, but could neither find any money nor think
of how to obtain any.</p>

<p>For, as the king remarked, all ordinary devices had been
exhausted long ago.</p>

<p>Then one of them remembered a certain fat priest who had an
image of Our Lady which worked miracles, and, as lie put a good
price on them, he was very rich.</p>

<p><i>King:</i> Why did he not mention this priest years ago?</p>

<p><i>Courtier:</i> Well, he was a holy man, and he (the speaker)
was afraid of the vengeance of Heaven.</p>

<p><i>King:</i> He was no holy man, or he would not charge for
his miracles, which were not his at all, but Our Lady's, and if
she was given a new gown probably she would say nothing.</p>

<p>So the soldiers were sent out to seize the priest and take
away his treasure, which they found was a mighty one.</p>

<p>They brought it away in two carts, and also the image of Our
Lady, who was wearing a very poor old smock, covered with
tattered lace.</p>

<p>So the king, who was a just man, gives her the queen's best
gown; and content she must have been, for nothing happened
because of their taking of the treasure.</p>

<p>In this way Don Felipe at last equipped his ship and set sail,
leaving the harbour at noon, driving before a southern gale, and
so into the distance and away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the king spent the money that remained wisely (which
made men marvel), and prepared his country for war.</p>

<p>And war began and raged for a year and a day, on the land and
on the sea.</p>

<p>And at the end of this time the miser had nearly crushed his
neighbour, for all the good fight that king made; for his country
was small, and he had few ships, and few soldiers, and very
little money.</p>

<p>But he maintained a high spirit and sang cheerfully over his
bottle at night, and fought bravely in the day with his fine
battle-axe, whack, whack, whack!</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2300361h-images/SDS-6-003.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>Still the time came when he could fight no more, for there was
nothing left to fight with; and the miser was preparing to
capture him and his subjects and make them all slaves for the
rest of their lives, when one fine day who should sail into the
harbour but Don Lopez, whom everyone had given up for lost long
ago!</p>

<p><i>In summa</i>, after many adventures which cannot here be
related, he had actually reached the New Country, and it was as
rich and wonderful as ever he had dreamed: there were gold and
silver, new birds, new beasts, new flowers, new fruits, and Don
Lopez drew after him four great boats he had built, filled with
ingots of gold and silver and strings of rubies and emeralds. You
may imagine the joy of my king, how he paid his soldiers and
bought them new arms, and finally fell on and defeated his enemy,
who was obliged to pay a heavy price for peace, and went mourning
for the rest of his days.</p>

<p>So my miser had not only lost the New Country because of his
avarice, but nearly his own as well; while the other king
speedily became one of the richest and most powerful monarchs in
the world.</p>

<p>And the first thing he did was to send for the priest and
offer to return him his treasure; but they found him with a new
image working miracles, and already as rich as he had been
before, so they gave him no money, but a silver bird, which shone
like a lit lamp, and had tail-feathers of crimson.</p>

<p>But Don Lopez was not so generous: he had become avaricious,
too, and the last thing he intended to do was to give half his
gains to Ottilia.</p>

<p>He hoped the hag was dead, and resolved never to go near that
country in case she was yet living, so put her out of his mind
and spent his days and nights counting his money.</p>

<p>But one evening while he was in his strong room, surrounded by
pearls and coral, and silver and amber, emeralds, rubies, lamps
of turkis, royal bone and gold&mdash;while, I say, he was
grinning and gloating over these treasures, down came my witch
through the chimney, and oh, but he was vexed to see her.</p>

<p>She said nothing at all; she just raised her broomstick and
brought it skilfully down on his head.</p>

<p><i>In summa</i>, the next morning they found Den Lopez lying,
a yellow corpse, on the ground, and all about him, instead of
gold and silver and jewels, were heaps of withered leaves.</p>

<p>So that was the end of my avaricious Don Lopez and his
treasure.</p>

<p><br>
AS Father Aloysius dosed the book a messenger came running in
with a mouth like the letter O.</p>

<p>"The Lord Cardinal," cried he, "is dead! He was crossing the
ferry when it upset and he fell in and was frozen stiff like a
winter radish!"</p>

<p>At the time Father Aloysius said nothing, but afterwards he
remarked that it was yet a third instance of the judgment
overtaking avarice.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">T was when the mountains were all veiled in
snow, the ground stiff with ice, and not one leaf left on the
vines, nor indeed on any tree save the fir and olive, that Father
Aloysius had occasion to speak again of the Deadly Sins; and this
time he spoke of SLOTH, the seventh sin, or, as it is better
expressed, <i>Accidie</i>, which means really more than Sloth,
also Melancholy and Gloom and Sourness, but is commonly
translated Sloth, and has been called by a great man "the rotten-
hearted sin of <i>Accidie</i>."</p>

<p>Now Father Aloysius had need to speak of this sin because it
was much abroad among the novices, who were very willing to lie
abed in the morning complaining of the cold, and very loth to do
any work, saving it was weather to sit by the fire and do nought
else, adding matter of complaints as to the snow, and their stiff
fingers and cold toes, and making wry faces over the meals, and
being generally dejected and miserable, huddling together and
shivering in corners of the Monastery.</p>

<p>So Father Aloysius got them all together in the great hall and
settled himself by the fire and made them sit in two rows before
him while he lectured them on the sin of <i>Accidie</i>, which he
could see (he said) by their blue faces and bunched shoulders had
a hold of them all.</p>

<br>


<div align="center">
<img src="2300361h-images/SDS-7-001.gif"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>For this seventh sin (said he) had an especial Devil, which
was of a blue colour, and it is credibly asserted by many that
when this particular blue devil commences plaguing a man (as he
does plague those who fall into this seventh sin), he is worse
than all the other devils and fiends and imps put together.</p>

<p>Now thus (he added) do I propound <i>Accidie</i>; what says
the Book? "Cursed be he who doeth the service of God
negligently," and he who follows this sin of <i>Accidie</i> doeth
all things negligently, yea, with heaviness and unlust and
carelessness and annoy.</p>

<p>Saint John too saith that this <i>Accidie</i> is an
abomination: it might be called the child of Wrath and Envy, for
they make great bitterness in the heart, and from this bitterness
is born <i>Accidie</i>; or it might be called the offspring of
Pride, which so puffs up a man that he thinks there is no need
for him to labour or follow goodness, and so sits him down
sourly, sucking his thumbs and growing dismal that the world is
passing him by without acknowledging his merits.</p>

<p>Then from this <i>Accidie</i> and Sloth comes a yet more
dreadful thing, nay, the most awful thing known to man, namely a
disdain and a despising of all the things of this world, and an
indifferency to all man has done, and may do, and an apathy
towards the great graces and beauties there are everywhere, and,
worst of all, a despair of God's mercy and a dread of Hell, which
last is that sin against the Holy Ghost which may not by any
means be forgiven, and which opens a man's heart to all the sins
and evils there are, for he is in despair and melancholy, and,
believing nothing, Both that which he lusts after and slips soon
to perdition. And this was the sin of Judas.</p>

<p>And he that is taken by <i>Accidie</i> is dull in mind and
body, given to Ignorance, who is the mother of all harm, and to
neglect and heavy slumbering, so that the days slip through his
fingers as sand through an open hand, and return whence they came
without bringing him any profit; neither in this world, nor the
next, for Heaven is only to be gained by much striving, and
Paradise is for them that labour and not for idle folk.</p>

<p>And sometimes it happens that a man may sink so deep in this
sin that he take his own life, which is very unnatural and
horrible to God; but more often they are like folk that fall into
a ditch and will not make the effort to rise out, nay, if one
help them, they fall back again and there they lie, while all
pass them.</p>

<p>Surely this is the most miserable and wretched of all the
Deadly sins, and so the Virtue that is set against it is the
highest and noblest of all the Virtues, namely Fortitude, or
Strength, of which there are several species, as Magnanimity and
Magnificence and Faith and Constancy. And these are very powerful
and princely virtues, and certainly to be put before the other
virtues, which may be set forward thus: Meekness or Humility, as
against <i>Superbia</i>, or Pride; against <i>Inuidie</i>, or
Envy, Love and Charity; against Ire or Wrath, Patience,
Obedience, and Gentleness; against Avarice, Generosity and Pity;
against <i>Gula</i>, or Gluttony, Temperance; against
<i>Luxuria</i>, or Lust, Chastity and Poverty; but the highest of
all these remains <i>Fortitudo</i>, which (as I have said) is set
against this wretched sin of <i>Accidie</i>.</p>

<p>And at this place I will give you the story of the young man
of Arles, which is memorable and well worthy to be preserved.</p>

<p>This young man was so sunk in this seventh sin that he had no
more pleasure in anything, but passed his days in bitter
discontent and melancholy self-communings.</p>

<p>He was young and healthy and well-favoured, but he utterly
slighted these blessings: he had a fine house, horses in his
stables, and good food on his board, but he despised all of them;
he had worthy friends whom he disdained, and he had certain
talents that he ignored and left uncultivated and rusty.</p>

<p>And there was all the world before him, and many things lie
might perform and see, but he would have none of them, but
remained always shut within his house, lazy, idle, melancholy,
and drifting towards despair.</p>

<p>He wondered why he was born just to grow old and die; the
world seemed to him very miserable, and he doubted very much of
Heaven.</p>

<p>For he was as one blind, yea, his soul was blind and dumb; he
crept about the town of Arles, and saw nothing but rows of houses
and commonplace people and dirt and sorrow; he went into the
country, and saw nothing but these same people labouring in the
fields and the poor huts in which they dwelt, all so dull and
ugly that he returned home gloomier than before. He did not see
the pretty maidens watering roses and carnations at their
casement windows, he did not see the little children playing
battledore and shuttlecock with little crowns of feathers (blue
and red) that mounted up into the sunshine, nor the beautiful
sleek cats on the doorsteps, nor the happy old women carding wool
and singing hymns in praise of the Virgin, nor the young masons
at work on the new church all flushed with pride, nor the
artisans going home in the evenings with eager feet.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2300361h-images/SDS-7-002.gif"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>Nor when he went into the country did he notice the fair
shapes and colours of the trees, the crystal stream churning
swiftly over the stones, the little flowers on the bank, the
smooth white sides of the oxen drawing the plough, the little
birds on the swaying boughs, the light and shadow of the
forest.</p>

<p>Nay, not for him was the magnificence of the hills, or the
beauty of the valleys, or the glory of the changeful heavens,
with the sun like red gold, the moon like a pearl, the stars like
frozen dewdrops; to him night and day were light and dark, and
each was more wearisome than the other.</p>

<p>And so tired of life did he become, that he resolved to make
an end of it; and one day took a piece of rope and went outside
the town walls, and wandered along till he found a quiet spot by
a little river, and there he put the rope round the bough of an
old thorn-tree, and hanged himself.</p>

<p>But the rope was too thin (he had been too lazy to search for
a more fitting one), and broke, and down he fell among the
alders, and sat there on the banks of the river looking up at the
rope, too slothful to mend it or return for another.</p>

<p>And when at last he took his eyes from the thorn-tree and the
rope he perceived an angel standing upon the other side of the
stream, regarding him keenly.</p>

<p>"Good day, Messire," said the angel courteously.</p>

<p>Now the young man blushed a little for shame at being seen in
this guise, for his hosen were all wrinkled, his doublet stained,
the buttons off his cuffs and the tags off his laces, besides
which his boots were broken, and he had not shaved for a week;
natheless he answered with his usual apathy&mdash;"Good day."</p>

<p>"Why are you so melancholy?" asked the angel. "And wherefore
is this rope?"</p>

<p>The young man made an effort and replied gloomily:</p>

<p>"That is a rope to hang myself wherewith."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the angel (he was very beautiful to look upon,
with bright shining clothes, and two great wings lying out
ruffled on his back, and a crown of coloured feathers, but to the
dull eyes of the young man he looked no more than a large kind of
bird).</p>

<p>Moreover, he did not wish to talk, but to roll himself up on
the bank and sleep, and, had it been a mortal speaking, he would
have been sullenly silent; it being, however, an angel who was
addressing him, he was impelled to some civility.</p>

<p>"Why, life is not worthy of being lived," he said.</p>

<p>"Nay," replied the angel, "yon are not worthy of living
it."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the young man. "I am a very good citizen. I
never annoy my neighbours, and I always pay the taxes. But it is
a miserable world, and I want to be out of it."</p>

<p>"Where do you mean to go?" asked the angel.</p>

<p>"Nowhere. I only want to be left in peace."</p>

<p>"Heaven is for those who labour, and there is no peace in
Hell, and very little in Purgatory," remarked the angel
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I do not believe," returned the other, "in any of the
three."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose that you do not believe in me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I see you are trying to make me think you are
an angel; but it is all a pretence."</p>

<p>"What do you think I am?" asked the angel; he put his head on
one side and looked at his reflection in the clear running
stream.</p>

<p>The young man yawned and replied very rudely: "I think that
you are nothing better than a kind of bird&mdash;a common bird,
but what your name is I have forgotten."</p>

<p>"You are, of course, quite blind," said the angel; "you are
also, I think, unhappy."</p>

<p>"Naturally," snapped the young man. "I was going to hang
myself when the rope broke."</p>

<p>"Would you not like to be happy?" asked the angel in a gentle
tone.</p>

<p>The young man began to sneer. "No one is happy."</p>

<p>"Then how does the world go on? Were every one like you it
would all stop to-morrow."</p>

<p>The young man thought over that; certainly he could vaguely
recall a vast number of people who seemed to be quite content; he
could recall laughter and songs, and kisses, and gay
dresses&mdash;he had always called these people fools and these
things follies; but now, by the great goodness of God and because
of the great joyousness radiating from the angel, he began to
wish suddenly that he too was a fool.</p>

<p>"Would you not like to be happy?" repeated the angel, and he
flew on to a bough of the thorn-tree, where the broken rope still
hung, and sunned himself, spreading his bright wings in a great
arc either side of him.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the young man suddenly. "I should. But it is a
miserable world, and I can find nothing to interest
me&mdash;nothing to do. Tell me how I may find happiness."</p>

<p>"You must search for it," replied the angel.</p>

<p>The young man was very much disappointed. "I have heard that
answer before," he said gloomily.</p>

<p>"Because it is the right and only one," said the angel.</p>

<p>The young man yawned. "You might as well set me to find the
Philosopher's Stone," he remarked.</p>

<p>"That is just what you should look for," said the angel; "it
means happiness and health and wealth and honour&mdash;it means
that you will see everything and understand everything."</p>

<p>For a moment the sluggard was roused, then he fell again into
his gloom: "for no one has ever found this stone," said he; "is
it likely I shall?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," smiled the angel.</p>

<p>Now this annoyed the other. "Oh, I do not know!" he grumbled.
"I suppose that, after all, I have as much chance as any one
else."</p>

<p>By which reply he showed that he was beginning to be a little
dispossessed of his sin of <i>Accidie</i>, for a few moments
previously nothing could have aroused him to anger.</p>

<p>"Well, try," suggested the angel; "it is better to be
searching for what you will never find than to be hanging
yourself on a May morning."</p>

<p>"Is it a May morning?" asked the young man stupidly; then he
added: "Why do you trouble to give me advice?"</p>

<p>"Because you have the most beautiful rose-tree in Aries in
your garden," was the reply. "And I and my friends have often
rested there on our way home in the evening, so I give you this
advice out of gratitude for your hospitality."</p>

<p>Now the young man had never noticed the rose-tree, so he said
nothing, but sat looking foolish, and the angel lifted his head
towards heaven and flew away and away until he was but a speck in
the springtide blue.</p>

<p>And the young man looked at the broken rope, and decided that
it would be just as much trouble to get another one as to begin
searching for the Philosopher's Stone, and, after all, if the
angel was an angel, perhaps he was right in what he said, and
there might be such a thing as happiness.</p>

<p>So he went home and made a few lazy experiments of his own,
but they were quite foolish, and he began anew to be weary of it
all, and to disbelieve in everything; but, on hearing some one
laughing in the street, he was inspired to continue his search
for happiness, and he went to a certain Alchemist who lived in
that town and hired himself out to him as an assistant, so that
he might learn the practical parts of this science.</p>

<p>Now this Alchemist had been searching for the Philosopher's
Stone for fifty years, and had spent many thousands of crowns on
his experiments; he had travelled in Persia, India, Arabia and
Palestine in search of the great secret, and spoken with many
learned and famous men, Magi, Jews and Magicians.</p>

<p>But none of them had the secret, or, if they had, would not
part with it; so the Alchemist returned to his native town and
worked by himself, and for his living he engraved gems and
silver, and sold perfumes and lotions, and painted pictures to be
set in rare and costly books.</p>

<p>Now he had lately lost his assistant, who had left him to go
on his travels, and he took my young sluggard because he offered
to serve without any wage.</p>

<p>And so they worked together at the furnaces and retorts,
mixing the metals, melting, refining, separating and combining,
and the young man became interested and almost glad to be
alive.</p>

<p>For the old Alchemist told him many strange things, and for
himself he began to notice the colour and flash of jewels, the
hardness and shape, the feel and sparkle of them, the scent and
sweetness of the clear green essences, the crystal-clear
perfumes, the white milk lotions all in their bottles, slender,
squat or oblong, standing in rows on the Alchemist's
shelf&mdash;he learnt to understand the excitement of the long
hours of waiting beside the furnace, burning deep-coloured like a
red rose or clear like a red diamond, and he began to know the
delights of poring over the great old books where the ancient
masters had hidden their learning.</p>

<p>But he was still a victim of <i>Accidie</i>; never could he
quite believe that there really was such a thing as the
Philosopher's Stone (though again and again the Alchemist had
told him that there was no use in even beginning to look for it
without <i>Faith</i>, fortified by <i>Contemplation</i> and
<i>Prayer</i>), and still he had his moments of gloom and
melancholy and despair, when he wished that he had hanged himself
as he had meant to.</p>

<p>And often his Master would find him asleep by the furnace with
the fire gone out, and many times he would refuse to get up in
the mornings, or sit idle all day sucking his thumbs.</p>

<p>But the Alchemist bore all this, because he paid him no
wage.</p>

<p>Now there was a certain book, the leaves of which were of
wood, and the covers of which were of pierced brass and within it
were most marvellous pictures made with a reed-pen, and coloured
with bright colours, and this book had been given to the
Alchemist by a certain Jew, to whom he had once done a service,
and this Jew had told him the book contained full directions for
making the Philosopher's Stone&mdash;but there was no writing in
it, only symbols and pictures, so that the meaning was mighty
difficult to unravel: yet the Alchemist thought that he had done
it, only was his labour made useless because certain pages of the
book were missing, and could by no means be found, though he had
searched all the world for them.</p>

<p>Now soon after the young man had begun to practise Alchemy
there came a stranger to the house of the Alchemist, and desired
to see the Master.</p>

<p>He was a very sober person, decently clad in green, and was
thought to be a customer for gems or perfumes; but proved to be
no such thing, for when he was alone with my Alchemist he says
very quietly: "Have you a certain fair book, very old and large
and gilded? And has it leaves of wood, on which are certain
pictures done with a reed-pen and admirably coloured?"</p>

<p>"Surely," replied the Alchemist, beginning to tremble with
excitement; "and these same pictures are no less than directions
for the <i>Magnum Opus</i>, if a man could unravel the meaning,
which, to wit, I think I have done, but alack, there are some
leaves missing."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the stranger, and he took from the breast of
his robe four leaves of wood, covered with fair and shining
figures. "Here are the remaining pages of that delicate and
precious book, and when you have the magistry of them, then you
will have discovered the great secret for which you have so
cheerfully and willingly laboured."</p>

<p>And at this the Alchemist began to weep and cry for joy, and
begged to know who his benefactor was&mdash;if he was some great
wizard such as Virgilius?</p>

<p>"I am," said the other, "no less," and with that left, while
the Alchemist, all in an amazement, went up to his laboratory and
set the missing pages in the book and began to study the problem
of them.</p>

<p>And this he now soon mastered, discovering the <i>prima
materia</i>, the agents he must use, the transmutations and the
projections he must proceed to.</p>

<p>Yet for a week he laboured, and there was no result in the
vessels; then he applied himself to <i>Prayer</i>, and again set
to work.</p>

<p>And presently he found in one of the vessels a strange stone,
no larger than a nut, transparent and of a pale brimstone colour,
and of smooth texture and a shining look, and this they wrapped
in a piece of wax, and put in a crucible with two pounds of lead,
and this crucible was set on the fire, and all night the
Alchemist and the young man worked the bellows and prayed.</p>

<p>And towards the morning the crucible made a hissing sound,
and, on taking it off the fire and looking in they found it was
full of a seething metal of the fairest colours possible, and
they poured out this aurified lead on to a slab of pure clean
alabaster, where it flashed into a green tint, then settled into
the hue of a lively red, the colour of fresh blood. With that
they poured it again into an ingot and left it to cool, and, on
presently looking at it, they found it to be a bar of the most
splendid shining gold.</p>

<p>So, after praising God, they ran off with this ingot (still
warm), and showed it to a goldsmith, who put it to all the tests
and pronounced it the finest gold in the world.</p>

<p>"We have found the Philosopher's Stone," said they to each
other, and they went home, and, again following the directions,
produced another piece of that excellent yellow and transparent
substance, half of which they projected on to a cup of base
metal, which changed to pure gold with a small ruby in the
bottom, made by the great strength and virtue of this wonderful
stone.</p>

<p>And the other half they dissolved with <i>aqua-fortis</i>, and
it turned into a medicine the colour of honey and exceedingly
sweet, and so strong that garnets, corals and silver-leaf being
put therein, did dissolve to their natural tinctures.</p>

<p>Now this medicine, being tasted, proved to be a most powerful
remedy, and cured them of all their pains and fatigues, and put
new life into them.</p>

<p>So they ran to a neighbour who was ill of a dropsy and gave
him to drink of the medicine, and he straight away recovered.</p>

<p>Now were they aware that they had really discovered that most
noble substance which was also the Elixir of youth as well as
capable of turning into the finest gold all baser metal.</p>

<p>This was a secret that must be very jealously kept, for it was
obvious that if they made their discovery publicly known the King
or some great one would seize them and keep them in durance,
where they would be forced to use their knowledge for his
benefit, as had indeed happened many times before to unfortunate
alchemists.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if they remained in Arles, practising and
saying nothing, the secret would surely get abroad through
gossip, and they were equally sure to be murdered and robbed by
some profane person who lusted for gold.</p>

<p>So they resolved to give out that their experiments had
failed, and that they were going on their travels in further
search of the great secret; and thus they would settle in some
foreign land, and enjoy their discovery, protecting themselves by
saying that their wealth was natural wealth. And the Alchemist,
who was a very pious, holy and charitable man (else he would
never have accomplished the Magnum Opus, for its achievement is
not given to carnal-minded or common people), intended to endow
seven hospitals, seven churches and seven schools, together with
a charnel-house, all built new from the ground, to the glory of
God.</p>

<p>And the ingot of gold and the gold cup with a ruby in the bowl
(as the pearl is within the shell of the oyster) he gave to a
poor little church that had no treasures.</p>

<p>Then did these two put their affairs in order and sell up
their goods and make their preparations for leaving their
country.</p>

<p>Now as the Alchemist had never been rich, and the young man's
estate had decayed through his sloth and neglect, or had been
dissipated by fools and stolen by knaves owing to his
indifferency and apathy, they found, on putting their resources
together, that they had but very little money with which to start
on their travels and to set up a new laboratory, so they resolved
once more to manufacture some portions of that noble and
excellent substance before they started; they calculated that, if
they obtained three pieces the size of a small apple, it would be
sufficient for twenty tons of gold.</p>

<p>So they again followed the directions of the book, and
produced the three stones; two of which they put by in a neat box
of cedar-wood, and the third they divided, and cast a portion of
it, the size of a coriander seed, into the crucible with
lead.</p>

<p>Now the Alchemist being on in years and fatigued, made a
medicine of the rest of this portion (as they had done before)
and drank it; soon after he fell into a sweet sleep, and they
young man was left alone to watch the furnace.</p>

<p>As he sat there, in the silence and loneliness, this miserable
sin of <i>Accidie</i>, from which he had never been quite free,
came upon him strongly; he wished he was in bed, instead of
tending the furnace; he wished he could lead his old lazy life,
instead of undertaking travels to a foreign country, where
doubtless there would be perils and fatigues to be endured.</p>

<p>As for the Philosopher's Stone, he began to doubt that they
had really discovered it&mdash;was it not all perhaps a delusion?
Had that really been gold?&mdash;and, if so, how were they sure
that they would ever find it again?</p>

<p>So he took down the book and the cedar-wood box containing the
portions of the stone, and seated himself by the furnace and
looked from one to another, struggling with his doubts and his
sloth.</p>

<p>Now at this moment there entered the room a person well known
to those who follow <i>Accidie</i>, and very familiar to my young
man, i.e. the Blue Devil, who is the captain of a band of smaller
blue devils very little better than himself.</p>

<p>The young man had not seen him for a long time, not since he
had met the angel by the thorn-tree, and he was very displeased
to sec him now.</p>

<p>He was certainly very ugly; his feet turned backwards, he had
a great hump on his back, his eyes were set crooked so that he
could never see things straight, and covered by thick black
glasses so that he could never see things clear.</p>

<p>He took the stool in the corner, he looked at the furnace, at
the book, and the cedar-wood box. "What a waste of time!" he
remarked.</p>

<p>"No," said the young man. "I am making gold."</p>

<p>The Blue Devil laughed. "You had better go to bed," he
replied.</p>

<p>The young man shook his head. "No," he said. "I have found the
Philosopher's Stone, and soon I shall find happiness&mdash;as the
angel told me."</p>

<p>"There are no angels," remarked the Blue Devil.</p>

<p>The young man continued, trying not to notice his visitor: "I
believe this book&mdash;and the evidences of these pieces of
stone."</p>

<p>"How silly!" said the Blue Devil. "The book is but a
collection of jargon, and the stone is just a compound of mercury
and sulphur."</p>

<p>The other doubtfully opened the book, and certainly the
pictures looked very dull and stupid; he opened the box, and
certainly the stones appeared very dull and ordinary. "But we
made gold and a ruby and a wonderful medicine," he objected.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind," said the Blue Devil. "You lost your
head, and did not know what you were looking at."</p>

<p>"But the goldsmith and the man with the dropsy?"</p>

<p>"They were fools like yourself," replied the Blue Devil; "and
remember the gold was <i>given</i> away (if you had tried to
<i>buy</i> something with it you would have soon seen if it was
good gold or not); and, as for the sick man, he was probably not
sick at all."</p>

<p>"Probably you are quite right," sighed the young man.
"Meanwhile, I ought to look to the fire; I see it is going out.
Would you put on some more coal?"</p>

<p>"Not I," said the Blue Devil with a sneer. "Why should I get
up from this chair where I am <i>moderately</i> comfortable to
stoke that furnace when I know there is no good coming from
it?"</p>

<p>The young man yawned seven times, and it is a well-known thing
that he who yawns seven times gives the Blue Devil great power
over him.</p>

<p>So that the fiend spoke again at once, and quite briskly: "Why
do you stay here enduring all this discomfort and misery, when
you might have been comfortably hanged long ago? You know that
there is nothing in any of it&mdash;there is no Philosopher's
Stone and no Elixir of youth and no happiness&mdash;why do you
give yourself all these fatigues?"</p>

<p>"But I promised the Alchemist," murmured the young man.</p>

<p>The Blue Devil soon disposed of that objection. "The Alchemist
either a fool who is cheating himself or a knave who is cheating
you&mdash;come, put an end to it. You know that you decided long
ago that life was not worth living."</p>

<p>So saying, he produced a nice long coil of rope and fixed it
to a strong nail on the wall, and up got my young man, overcome
by this dreadful sin of <i>Accidie</i>, and stuck his head in the
noose; but the Blue Devil had been too lazy to make the noose the
right length, and so the young man stood with his feet on the
ground, and, being too slothful to move, in that position went to
sleep.</p>

<p>Now he had placed on the edge of the furnace the book and the
cedar-wood box, and the Blue Devil, as he slouched away, gave
them a shove and both fell into the furnace, where they were
burnt to cinders, which furnace, soon after growing cold, the
transmutation in the crucible was spoilt.</p>

<p>And so what did my Alchemist find in the morning?</p>

<p>That this excellent secret was for ever lost!</p>

<p>The furnace out&mdash;the lead unchanged in the
vessel&mdash;and in the ashes the brass covers of the book and
the scorched remains of that precious substance.</p>

<p>And by the wall the young man standing asleep, his head
hanging in the noose.</p>

<p>Now the Alchemist was a good, holy and patient man (or, as I
have said, he could never have followed this profession); but,
once he had grasped what had happened, he did not hesitate a
moment.</p>

<p>He looked at the nail; he drove it farther in with a blow from
the heel of his shoe, then he lowered the knot and tightened up
the rope.</p>

<p>And so my sluggard was hanged in earnest.</p>

<p>After this the Alchemist gathered up the available crowns and
calmly went off to another country, where he recommenced his
labours without an assistant.</p>

<p>And after a few years Virgilius again came to his aid, and he
rediscovered that marvellous stone, and died a holy man.</p>

<p>This is the end of these stories of the Seven Deadly Sins;
there are others to be told of the Ten Commandments, which, said
Father Aloysius, are interesting, but greatly tax both power and
intelligence to deal with.</p>
