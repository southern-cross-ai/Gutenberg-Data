<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<p class="first">IT was the big central taproot which
baffled them. They had hewed easily through the great side
roots, large as branches, covered with soft brown bark;
they had dug down and cut through the forest of tender
small roots below; but when they had passed the main body
of the stump and worked under it, they found that their
hole around the trunk was not large enough in diameter to
enable them to reach to the taproot and cut through it.
They could only reach it feebly with the hatchet, fraying
it, but there was no chance for a free swing to sever the
tough wood. Instead of widening the hole at once, they kept
laboring at the root, working the stump back and forth, as
though they hoped to crystallize that stubborn taproot and
snap it like a wire. Still it held and defied them. They
laid hold of it together and tugged with a grunt; something
tore beneath that effort, but the stump held, and upward
progress ceased.</p>

<p>They stopped, too tired for profanity, and gazed down
the mountainside after the manner of baffled men, who look
far off from the thing that troubles them. They could tell
by the trees that it was a high altitude. There were no
cottonwoods, though the cottonwoods will follow a stream
for more than a mile above sea level. Far below them a
pale mist obscured the beautiful silver spruce which had
reached their upward limit. Around the cabin marched a
scattering of the balsam fir. They were nine thousand feet
above the sea, at least. Still higher up the sallow forest
of lodgepole pines began; and above these, beyond the
timberline, rose the bald summit itself.</p>

<p>They were big men, framed for such a country, defying
the roughness with a roughness of their own&mdash;these
stalwart sons of old Bill Campbell. Both Harry and Joe
Campbell were fully six feet tall, with mighty bones and
sinews and work-toughened muscles to justify their stature.
Behind them stood their home, a shack better suited for the
housing of cattle than of men. But such leather-skinned
men as these were more tender to their horses than to
themselves. They slept and ate in the shack, but they lived
in the wind and the sun.</p>

<p>Although they had looked down the stern slopes to the
lower Rockies, they did not see the girl who followed the
loosely winding trail. She was partly sheltered by the
firs and came out just above them. They began moiling at
the stump again, sweating, cursing, and the girl halted
her horse near by. The profanity did not distress her.
She was so accustomed to it that the words had lost all
edge and point for her; but her freckled face stirred to
a smile of pleasure at the sight of their strength, as
they alternately smote at the taproot and then strove in
creaking, grunting unison to work it loose.</p>

<p>They remained so long oblivious of her presence that
at length she called, "Why don't you dig a bigger hole,
boys?"</p>

<p>She laughed in delight as they jerked up their heads in
astonishment. Her laughter was young and sweet to the ear,
but there was not a great deal outside her laughter that
was attractive about her.</p>

<p>However, Joe and Harry gaped and grinned and blushed at
her in the time- old fashion, for she lived in a country
where to be a woman is sufficient, beauty is an unnecessary
luxury, soon taxed out of existence by the life. She
possessed the main essentials of social power; she could
dance unflaggingly from dark to dawn at the nearest
schoolhouse dance, chattering every minute; and she could
maintain a rugged silence from dawn to dark again, as she
rode her pony home.</p>

<p>Harry Campbell took off his hat, not in politeness, but
to scratch his head. "Say, Jessie, where'd you drop from?
Didn't see you coming no ways."</p>

<p>"Maybe I come down like rain," said Jessie.</p>

<p>All three laughed heartily at this jest.</p>

<p>Jessie swung sidewise in her saddle with the lithe grace
of a boy, dropped her elbow on the high pommel, and gave
advice. "You got a pretty bad taproot under yonder. Better
chop out a bigger hole, boys. But, say, what you clearing
this here land for? Ain't no good for nothing, is it?" She
looked around her. Here and there the clearing around the
shanty ate raggedly into the forest, but still the plowed
land was chopped up with a jutting of boulders.</p>

<p>"Sure it ain't no good for nothing," said Joe. "It's
just the old man's idea."</p>

<p>He jerked a grimy thumb over his shoulder to indicate
the controlling and absent power of the old man, somewhere
in the woods.</p>

<p>"Sure makes him glum when we ain't working. If they
ain't nothing worthwhile to do he always sets us to
grubbing up roots; and if we ain't diggin' up roots, we got
to get out old 'Maggie' mare and try to plow. Plow in rocks
like them! Nobody but Bull can do it."</p>

<p>"I didn't know Bull could do nothing," said the girl
with interest.</p>

<p>"Aw, he's a fool, right enough," said Harry, "but he
just has a sort of head for knowing where the rocks are
under the ground, and somehow he seems to make old Maggie
hoss know where they lie, too. Outside of that he sure
ain't no good. Everybody knows that."</p>

<p>"Kind of too bad he ain't got no brains," said the
girl. "All his strength is in his back, and none is in his
head, my dad says. If he had some part of sense he'd be a
powerful good hand."</p>

<p>"Sure would be," agreed Harry. "But he ain't no good
now. Give him an ax maybe, and he hits one or two wallopin'
licks with it and then stands and rests on the handle and
starts to dreaming like a fool. Same way with everything.
But, say, Joe, maybe he could start this stump out of the
hole."</p>

<p>"But I seen you both try to get the stump up," said the
girl in wonder.</p>

<p>"Get Bull mad and he can lift a pile," Joe assured her.
"Go find him, Harry."</p>

<p>Harry obediently shouted, "Bull! Oh, Bull!"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"Most like he's reading," observed Joe. "He don't never
hear nothing then. Go look for him, Harry."</p>

<p>Big Harry strode to the door of the hut.</p>

<p>"How come he understands books?" said the girl. "I
couldn't never make nothing out of 'em."</p>

<p>"Me neither," agreed Joe in sympathy. "But maybe Bull
don't understand. He just likes to read because he can sit
still and do it. Never was a lazier gent than Bull."</p>

<p>Harry turned at the door of the shack. "Yep, reading,"
he announced with disgust. He cupped his hands over his
mouth and bellowed through the doorway, "Hey!"</p>

<p>There was a startled grunt within, a deep, heavy voice
and a thick articulation. Presently a huge man came into
the doorway and leaned there, his figure filling it.
There was nothing freakish about his build. He was simply
over-normal in bulk, from the big head to the heavy feet.
He was no more than a youth in age, but the great size and
the bewildered puckering of his forehead made him seem
older. The book was still in his hand.</p>

<p>"Hey," returned Harry, "we didn't call you out here to
read to us. Leave the book behind!"</p>

<p>Bull looked down at the book in his hand, seemed to
waken from a trance, then, with a muffled sound of apology,
dropped the book behind him.</p>

<p>"Come here!"</p>

<p>He slumped out from the house. His gait was like his
body, his stride large and loose. The lack of nervous
energy which kept his mind from a high tension was shown
again in the heavy fall of his feet and the forward slump
of his head. His hands dangled aimlessly at his sides, as
though in need of occupation. A ragged thatch of blond hair
covered his head and it was sunburned to straw color at the
edges.</p>

<p>His costume was equally rough. He wore no belt, but one
strap, from his right hip, crossed behind his back, over
the bulging muscles of his shoulder to the front of his
left hip. The trousers, which this simple brace supported,
were patched overalls, frayed to loose threads halfway down
the calf where they were met by the tops of immense cowhide
boots. As for the shirt, the sleeves were inches too short,
and the unbuttoned cuffs flapped around the burly forearms.
If it had been fastened together at the throat he would
have choked. He seemed, in a word, to be bulging out of his
clothes. One expected a mighty rending if he made a strong
effort.</p>

<p>This bulk of a man slouched forward with steps both huge
and hesitant, pausing between them. When he saw the girl
he stopped short, and his brow puckered more than before.
One felt that, coming from the shadow, he was dazed and
startled by the brilliant mountain sunshine; and the eyes
were dull and alarmed. It was a handsome face in a way, but
a little too heavy with flesh, too inert, like the rest of
his body and his muscular movements.</p>

<p>"She ain't going to bite you," said Harry Campbell.
"Come on over here to the stump." He whispered to the girl,
"Laugh at him!"</p>

<p>She obeyed his command. It brought a flush to the face
of Bull Hunter and made his head bow. He shuffled to the
stump and stood aimlessly beside it.</p>

<p>"Get down into the hole, you fool!" ordered Joe.</p>

<p>He and Harry took a certain pride in ordering their
cousin around. It was like performing with a lion in the
presence of a lady; it was manipulating an elephant by
power of the unaided voice. Slowly Bull Hunter dropped his
great feet into the hole and then raised his head a little
and looked wistfully to the brothers for further orders.</p>

<p>But only half his mind was with them. The other half
was with the story in the book. There Quentin Durward had
been nodding at his guard in the castle, and the evil-faced
little king had just sprung out and wrenched the weapon
from the hands of the sleepy boy. Bull Hunter could see
the story clearly, very clearly. The scar on the face of
Le Balafré glistened for him; he had veritably tasted the
little round loaves of French bread that the adventurer had
eaten with the pseudo-merchant.</p>

<p>But to step out of that world of words into this keen
sunlight&mdash; ah, there was the difference! The minds
which one found in the pages of a book were understandable.
But the minds of living men&mdash;how terrible they were!
One could never tell what passed behind the bright eyes of
other human beings. They mocked one. When they seemed sad
they might be about to laugh. The minds of the two brothers
eluded him, mocked him, slipped from beneath the slow grasp
of his comprehension. They whipped him with their scorn.
They dodged him with their wits. They bewildered him with
their mockery.</p>

<p>But they were nothing compared with the laughter of the
girl. It went through him like the flash and point of Le
Balafré's long sword. He was helpless before that sound of
mirth. He wanted to hold up his hands and cower away from
her and from her dancing eyes. So he stood, ponderous,
tortured, and the three pairs of clear eyes watched him and
enjoyed his torture. Better, far better, that dark castle
in ancient France, and the wicked Oliver and the yet more
wicked Louis.</p>

<p>"Lay hold on that stump," shouted Harry.</p>

<p>He heard the directions through a haze. It was twice
repeated before he bowed and set his great hands upon the
ragged projections, where the side roots had been cut away.
He settled his grip and waited. He was glad because this
bowed position gave him a chance to look down to the ground
and avoid their cruel eyes. How bright those eyes were,
thought Bull, and how clearly they saw all things! He never
doubted the justice behind their judgments of him; all that
Bull asked from the world was a merciful silence&mdash;to
let him grub in his books now and then, or else to tell him
how to go about some simple work, such as digging with a
pick. Here one's muscles worked, and there was no problem
to disturb wits which were still gathering wool in the
pages of some old tale.</p>

<p>But they were shrilling new directions at him; perhaps
they had been calling to him several times.</p>

<p>"You blamed idiot, are you goin' to stand there all day?
We didn't give you that stump to rest on. Pull it up!"</p>

<p>He started with a sense of guilt and tugged up. His
fingers slipped off their separate grips, and the stump,
though it groaned against the taproot under the strain, did
not come out.</p>

<p>"It don't seem to budge, somehow," said Bull in his big,
soft, plaintive voice. Then he waited for the laughter.
There was always laughter, no matter what he did or said,
but he never grew calloused against it. It was the one pain
which ever pierced the mist of his brain and cut him to the
quick. And he was right. There was laughter again. He stood
suffering mutely under it.</p>

<p>The girl's face became grave. She murmured to Harry,
"Ever try praisin' to big stupid?"</p>

<p>"Him? Are you joshin' me, Jessie? What's he ever done to
be praised about?"</p>

<p>"You watch!" said the girl. Growing excited with her
idea, she called, "Say, Bull!"</p>

<p>He lifted his head, but not his eyes. Those eyes studied
the impatient feet of the girl's mustang; he waited for
another stroke of wit that would bring forth a fresh shower
of laughter at his expense.</p>

<p>"Bull, you're mighty big and strong. About the biggest
and strongest man I ever seen!"</p>

<p>Was this a new and subtle form of mockery? He waited
dully.</p>

<p>"I seen Harry and Joe both try to pull up that root, and
they couldn't so much as budge it. But I bet you could do
it all alone, Bull! You just try! I bet you could!"</p>

<p>It amazed him. He lifted his eyes at length; his face
suffused with a flush; his big, cloudy eyes were glistening
with moisture.</p>

<p>"D'you mean that?" he asked huskily.</p>

<p>For this terrible, clear-eyed creature, this mocking
mind, this alert, cruel wit was actually speaking words of
confidence. A great, dim joy welled up in the heart of Bull
Hunter. He shook the forelock out of his eyes.</p>

<p>"You just try, will you, Bull?"</p>

<p>"I'll try!"</p>

<p>He bowed. Again his thick fingers sought for a grip,
found places, worked down through the soft dirt and the
pulpy bark to solid wood, and then he began to lift. It
was a gradual process. His knees gave, sagging under the
strain from the arms. Then the back began to grow rigid,
and the legs in turn grew stiff, as every muscle fell into
play. The shoulders pushed forward and down. The forearms,
revealed by the short sleeves, showed a bewildering
tangle of corded muscle, and, at the wrists, the tendons
sprang out as distinct and white as the new strings of a
violin.</p>

<p>The three spectators were undergoing a change. The
suppressed grins of the two brothers faded. They glanced at
the girl to see if she were not laughing at the results of
her words to big Bull, but the girl was staring. She had
set that mighty power to work, and she was amazed by the
thing she saw. And they, looking back at Bull, were amazed
in turn. They had seen him lift great logs, wrench boulders
from the earth. But always it had been a proverb within the
Campbell family that Bull would make only one attempt and,
failing in the first effort, would try no more. They had
never seen the mysterious resources of his strength called
upon.</p>

<p>Now they watched first the settling and then the
expansion of the body of their big cousin. His shoulders
began to tremble; they heard deep, harsh panting like the
breathing of a horse as it tugs a ponderous load up a hill,
and still he had not reached the limit of his power. He
seemed to grow into the soil, and his feet ground deeper
into the soft dirt, and ever there was something in him
remaining to be tapped. It seemed to the brothers to be
merely vast, unexplored recesses of muscle, but even then
it was a prodigious thing to watch the strain on the stump
increase moment by moment. That something of the spirit was
being called upon to aid in the work was quite beyond their
comprehension.</p>

<p>There was something like a groan from Bull&mdash;a
queer, animal sound that made all three spectators shiver
where they stood. For it showed that the limit of that
apparently inexhaustible strength had been reached and
that now the anguish of last effort was going into the
work. They saw the head bowed lower; the shoulders were now
bunching and swelling up on either side.</p>

<p>Then came a faint rending sound, like cloth slowly torn.
It was answered by something strangely like a snarl from
the laborer. Something jerked through his body as though a
whip had been flicked across his back. With a great rending
and a loud snap the big stump came up. A little shower of
dirt spouted up with the parting of the taproot. The trunk
was flung high, but not out of the hands of Bull Hunter.
He whirled it around his head, laughing. There was a ring
and clearness in that laughter that they had never heard
before. He dashed the stump on the ground.</p>

<p>"It's out!" exclaimed Bull. "Look there!"</p>

<p>He strode upon them. As he straightened up he became
huger than ever. They shrank from him&mdash;from the veins
which still bulged on his forehead and from the sweat and
pallor of that vast effort. The very mustang winced from
this mountain of a man who came with a long, sweeping,
springing stride. On his face was a strange joy as of the
explorer who tops the mountains and sees the beauty of the
promised land beneath him. He held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Lady, I got to thank you. You&mdash;taught me how!"</p>

<p>But she shrank from his outstretched hand&mdash;as
though she had labored to a larger end than she dreamed and
was terrified by the thing she had made.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you got a red stain on your hands. Oh!"</p>

<p>He came to a stop sharply. The sharp edges, where the
roots had been cut away had worked through the skin and his
hands were literally caked with mud and stained red. Bull
looked down at his hands vaguely.</p>

<p>It came to Harry that Bull was taking up a trifle too
much of Jessie's attention. The next thing they knew she
would be inviting him to come to the next dance down her
way, and they would have the big hulk of a man shaming
himself and his uncle's family.</p>

<p>"Go on back to the house," he ordered sharply. "We don't
have no more need of you."</p>

<p>Bull obeyed, stumbling along and still looking down at
his wounded hands.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>

<p class="first">HE left the three behind him, bewildered
and frightened. Had lightning split a thick tree beside
them, or an unexpected landslide thundered past and swept
the ground away at their feet, they could have been hardly
more disturbed.</p>

<p>"Who'd of thought he could act like that!" remarked Joe.
"My gosh, Jessie!"</p>

<p>They went and looked at the hole where the stump had
stood. At the bottom was the white remnant of the taproot
where it had burst under the strain.</p>

<p>"It wasn't so much how he pulled up the stump," said the
girl faintly. "But&mdash;but did you see his face, boys,
after he heaved the stump up? I &mdash;just pick that stump
up, will you?"</p>

<p>They went to the misshapen, ragged monster and lifted
it, puffing under the weight.</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>They dropped it obediently.</p>

<p>"And he&mdash;he just swung it around his head like it
was nothing!" declared the girl. "Look how it smashed into
the gravel where he threw it down! Why&mdash;why&mdash;I
didn't know men was made like that. And his face &mdash;the
way he laughed&mdash;why he didn't look like no fool at
all, boys. But just as if he'd waked up!"</p>

<p>"You act so interested," said Harry Campbell dryly,
"that maybe you'd like to have us call him out again so's
you can talk to him?"</p>

<p>Apparently she did not hear, but stared down into the
mist of the late afternoon, warning her that she must
start home. She seemed puzzled and a little frightened.
When she left them it was with a wave of the hand and with
no words of farewell. They watched her go down the trail
that jerked back and forth across the pitch of the slope;
twice her pony stumbled, a sure sign that the rider was
absent-minded.</p>

<p>"Jessie didn't seem to know what to make of it," said
Harry.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," returned his brother.</p>

<p>Both of them spoke in subdued voices as if they were
afraid of being overheard.</p>

<p>"And think if he'd ever lay a hold on one of us like
that!" said Harry. He went to the stump and examined the
side of one of the roots. It was stained with crimson.</p>

<p>"Look where his finger tips worked through the dirt and
the bark, right down to the solid wood," murmured Joe.</p>

<p>They looked at each other uneasily. "My gosh," said
Joe, "think of the way I handled him the other night!
He&mdash;he let me trip him up and throw him!" He
shuddered. "Why, if he'd laid hold of me just once, he'd of
squashed my muscles like they was rotten fruit!"</p>

<p>Of one accord they turned back to the house. At the door
they paused and peered in, as into the den of a bear. There
sat Bull on the floor&mdash;he risked his weight to none of
the crazy chairs&mdash;still looking at his stained hands.
Then they drew back and again looked at each other with
scared eyes and spoke in undertones.</p>

<p>"After this maybe he won't want to follow orders. Maybe
he'll get sort of free and easy and independent."</p>

<p>"If he does, you watch Dad give him his marching orders.
Dad won't have no one lifting heads agin' him."</p>

<p>"Neither will I," snapped Joe. "I guess we own this
house. I guess we support that big hulk. I'm going to try
him right quick."</p>

<p>He went back to the door of the shack. "Bull, they ain't
any wood for the stove tonight. Go chop some quick."</p>

<p>The floor squeaked and groaned under Bull's weight as he
rose, and again the brothers looked to each other.</p>

<p>"All right," came cheerily from Bull Hunter.</p>

<p>He came through the door with his ax and went to the log
pile. The brothers watched him throw aside the top logs and
get at the heavier trunks underneath. He tore one of these
out, laid it in place, and the sun flashed on the swift
circle of the ax. Joe and Harry stepped back as though the
light had blinded them.</p>

<p>"He didn't never work like that before," declared
Joe.</p>

<p>The ax was buried almost to the haft in the tough wood,
and the steel was wrenching out with a squeak of the metal
against the resisting wood. Again the blinding circle and
the indescribable sound of the ax's impact, slicing through
the wood. A great chip snapped up high over the shoulder of
the chopper and dropped solidly to the ground at the feet
of the brothers. Again they exchanged glances and drew a
little closer together. The log divided under the shower of
eating blows, and Bull attacked the next section.</p>

<p>Presently he came to a pause, leaning on the handle of
the ax and staring into the distance. At this the brothers
sighed with relief.</p>

<p>"I guess he ain't changed so much," said Harry. "But it
was queer, eh? Kind of like a bear waking up after he'd
been sleeping all winter!"</p>

<p>They jarred Bull out of his dream with a shout and set
him to work again; then they started the preparations
for the evening meal. The simple preparations were soon
completed, but after the potatoes were boiled, they delayed
frying the bacon, for their father, old Bill Campbell, had
not yet returned from his hunting trip and he disliked
long-cooked food. Things had to be freshly served to suit
Bill, and his sons dared the wrath of heaven rather than
the biting reproaches of the old man.</p>

<p>It was strange that Bill delayed his coming so long. As
a rule he was always back before the coming of evening. An
old and practiced mountaineer, he had never been known to
lose sense of direction or sense of distance, and he was an
hour overdue when the sun went down and the soft, beautiful
mountain twilight began.</p>

<p>There were other reasons which would ordinarily have
disturbed Bill and brought him home even ahead of time.
Snow had fallen heavily above the timberline a few days
before, and now the keen whistling of the wind and the
swift curtaining of clouds, which was drawing across the
sky, threatened a new storm that might even reach down to
the shack.</p>

<p>And yet no Bill appeared.</p>

<p>The brothers waited in the shack, and the darkness
was increasing. Any one of a number of things might have
happened to their father, but they were not worried. For
one thing, they wasted no love on the stern old man. They
knew well enough that he had plenty of money, but he kept
them here to a dog's life in the shack, and they hated him
for it. Besides, they had a keen grievance which obscured
any worry about Bill&mdash;they were hungry, wildly hungry.
The darkness set in, and the feeble light wandered from the
smoked chimney of the lantern and made the window black.</p>

<p>Outside, the wind began to scream, sighing in the
distance among the firs, and then pouncing upon the cabin
and shaking it as though in rage. The fire would smoke
in the stove at every one of these blasts, and the flame
leaped in the lantern.</p>

<p>Bull Hunter had to lean closer to the light and frown
to make out the print of his book. The sight of his stolid
immobility merely sharpened their hunger, for there was
never any passion in this hulk of a man. When he relaxed
over a book the world went out like a snuffed candle for
him. He read slowly, lingering over every page, for now and
again his eyes drifted away from the print, and he dreamed
over what he had read. In reality he was not reading for
the plot, but for the pictures he found, and he dreaded
coming to the end of a book also, for books were rare in
his life. A scrap of a magazine was a treasure. A full
volume was a nameless delight.</p>

<p>And so he worked slowly through every paragraph and made
it his and dreamed over it until he knew every thought
and every picture by heart. Once slowly devoured in this
way, it was useless to reread a book. It was far better to
simply sit and let the slow memory of it trail through his
mind link by link, just as he had first read it and with
all the embroiderings which his own fancy had conjured
up.</p>

<p>Often this stupid pondering over a book would madden
the two brothers. It irritated them till they would move
the lantern away from him. But he always followed the
light with a sigh and uncomplainingly settled down again.
Sometimes they even snatched the book out of his hands.
In that case he sat looking down at his empty fingers,
dreaming over his own thoughts as contentedly as though
the living page were in his vision. There was small
satisfaction in tormenting him in these ways.</p>

<p>Tonight they dared not bother him. The stained hands
were still in their minds, and the tremendous, joyous
laughter as he whirled the stump over his head still rang
in their ears. But they watched him with a sullen envy of
his immobility. Just as a man without an overcoat envies
the woolly coat of a dog on a windy December day.</p>

<p>Only one sound roused the reader. It was a sudden
loud snorting from the shed behind the house and a dull
trampling that came to him through the noise of the rising
wind. It brought Bull lurching to his feet, and the stove
jingled as his weight struck the yielding center boards of
the floor. Out into the blackness he strode. The wind shut
around him at once and plastered his clothes against his
body as if he had been drenched to the skin in water. Then
he closed the door.</p>

<p>"What brung him to life?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Nothin', He just heard ol' Maggie snort. Always bothers
him when Maggie gets scared of something&mdash;the old
fool!"</p>

<p>Maggie was an ancient, broken-down draft horse. Strange
vicissitudes had brought her up into the mountains via the
logging camp. She was kept, not because there was any real
hauling to be done for Bill Campbell, but because, having
got her for nothing, she reminded him of the bargain she
had been. And Bull, apparently understanding the sluggish
nature of the old mare by sympathy of kind, use to work
her to the single plow among the rocks of their clearing.
Here, every autumn, they planted seed that never grew to
mature grain. But that was Bill Campbell's idea of making a
home.</p>

<p>Presently Bull came back and settled with a slump into
his old place.</p>

<p>"Going to snow?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"Feel it in the wind?"</p>

<p>It was an old joke among them, for Bull often declared
with ridiculous solemnity that he could foretell snow by
the change in the air.</p>

<p>"Yep," answered Bull, "I felt the wind."</p>

<p>He looked up at them, abashed, but they were too hungry
to waste breath with laughter. They merely sneered at him
as he settled back into his book. And, just as his head
bowed, a far shouting swept down at them as the wind veered
to a new point.</p>

<p>"Uncle Bill!" said Bull and rose again to open the
door.</p>

<p>The others wedged in behind his bulk and stared into the
blackness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>

<p class="first">THEY stood with the wind taking them with
its teeth and pressing them heavily back. They could hear
the fire flare and flutter in the stove; then the wind
screamed again, and the wail came down to them.</p>

<p>"Uncle Bill!" repeated Bull and, lowering his head,
strode into the storm.</p>

<p>The others exchanged frightened glances and then
followed, but not outside of the shaft of light from the
door. In the first place it was probably not their father.
Who could imagine Bill shouting for help? Such a thing had
never been dreamed of by his worst enemies, and they knew
that their father's were legion. Besides it was cold, and
this was a wild-goose chase which meant a chilled hide and
no gain.</p>

<p>But, presently, through the darkness they made out the
form of a horseman and the great bulk of Bull coming back
beside him. Then they ran out into the night.</p>

<p>They recognized the hatless, squat figure of their
father at once, even in the dark, with the wind twitching
his beard sideways. When they called to him he did not
speak. Then they saw that Bull was leading the horse.</p>

<p>Plainly something was wrong, and presently they
discovered that Bill Campbell was actually tied upon
his horse. He gave no orders, and they cut the ropes in
silence. Still he did not dismount.</p>

<p>"Bull," he commanded, "lift me off the hoss!"</p>

<p>The giant plucked him out of the saddle and placed him
on the ground, but his legs buckled under him, and he fell
forward on his face. Any of the three could have saved him,
but the spectacle of the terrible old man's helplessness
benumbed their senses and their muscles.</p>

<p>"Carry me in!" said Bill at last.</p>

<p>Bull lifted him and bore him gingerly through the door
and placed him on the bunk. The light revealed a grisly
spectacle. Crimson stains and dirt literally covered
him; his left leg was bandaged below the knee; his right
shoulder was roughly splinted with small twigs and swathed
in cloth.</p>

<p>The long ride, with his legs tied in place, had
apparently paralyzed his nerves below the hips. He remained
crushed against the wall, his legs falling in the odd
position in which they were put down by Bull. It was
illustrative of his character that, even in this crisis,
not one of the three dared venture an expression of
sympathy, a question, a suggestion.</p>

<p>Crumpled against the wall, his head bowed forward and
cramped, the stern old man still controlled them with the
upward glance of his eyes through the shag of eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Gimme my pipe," he commanded.</p>

<p>Three hands reached for it&mdash;pipe, tobacco, matches
were proffered to him. Before he accepted the articles he
swept their faces with a glance of satisfaction. Without
attempting to change the position which must have been
torturing him, he filled the pipe bowl, his fingers moving
as if he had partially lost control of them. He filled it
raggedly, shreds of tobacco hanging down around the bowl.
He bent his head to meet the left hand which he raised with
difficulty, then he tried to light a match. But he seemed
incapable of moving the sulphur head fast enough to bring
it to a light with friction. Match after match crumbled as
he continued his efforts.</p>

<p>"Here, lemme light a match for you, Dad!"</p>

<p>Harry's offer was received with a silent curling of the
lips and a glint of the yellow teeth beneath that made him
step back. The old man continued his work. There were a
dozen wrecked matches before the blood began to stir in his
numbed arm and he was able to light the match and the pipe.
He drew several breaths of the smoke deep into his lungs.
For the moment the savage, hungry satisfaction changed his
face; they could tell by that alteration what agonies he
had been suffering before.</p>

<p>Presently he frowned and set about changing his position
with infinite labor. The left leg was helpless, and so was
the right arm. Yet, after much labor, he managed to stuff
a roll of the blankets into the corner and then shift
himself until his back rested against this support. But his
strength deserted him again. His pipe was dropped down in
the left hand, his head sagged back.</p>

<p>Still they dared not approach him. His two sons stood
about, shifting from one foot to another, as if they
expected a blow to descend upon them at any moment, as if
each labored movement of terrible old Bill Campbell caused
them the agony which he must be suffering.</p>

<p>As for Bull Hunter, he sat again on the floor, his chin
dropped upon his great fist, and wondered for a time at
his uncle. It was the second great event to him, all in
one day. First he had discovered that by fighting a thing,
one can actually conquer. Second, he discovered that great
fighter, his uncle, had been beaten. The impossible had
happened twice between one sunrise and sunset.</p>

<p>But men and the affairs of men could not hold his eye
overlong. Presently he dropped his head again and was deep
in the pages of his book. At length Bill Campbell heaved
up his head. It was to glare into the scared faces of his
sons.</p>

<p>"How long are you goin' to keep me waiting for food?"</p>

<p>The order snapped them into action. They sprang here and
there, and presently the thick slices of bacon were hissing
on the pan, and the clouds of bacon smoke wafted through
the cabin. When they reached Bill Campbell he blinked. Pain
had given him a maddening appetite, yet he puffed steadily
on his pipe and said nothing.</p>

<p>The tin plate of potatoes and bacon was shoved before
him, and the big tin cup of coffee. The three younger men
sat in silence and devoured their own meal; the two sons
swiftly, but Bull Hunter fell into musings, and part of
his food remained uneaten. Then his glance wandered to his
uncle and saw a thing to wonder at&mdash;a horrible thing
in its own way.</p>

<p>The nerveless left hand of the mountaineer, which had
barely possessed steadiness to light a match, was far
too inaccurate to handle a fork; and Bull saw his uncle
stuffing his mouth with his fingers and daring the others
to watch him.</p>

<p>Something like pity came to Bull. It was so rare an
emotion to connect with human beings that he hardly
recognized it, for men and women, as he knew them, were
brilliant, clever creatures, perfectly at home in the midst
of difficulties that appalled him. But, as he watched the
old man feed himself like an animal, the emotion that rose
in Bull was the sadness he felt when he watched old Maggie
stumbling among the rocks. There was something wrong with
the forelegs of Maggie, and she was only half a horse when
it came to going downhill on broken ground. He had always
thought of the great strength that once must have been
hers, and he pitied her for the change. He found himself
pitying Uncle Bill Campbell in much the same way.</p>

<p>When Bill raised his tin cup he spilled scalding coffee
on his breast. The old man merely set his teeth and
continued to glare his challenge at the three. But not one
of the three dared speak a word, dared make an offer of
assistance.</p>

<p>What baffled the slow mind of Bull Hunter was the effort
to imagine a force so great that battle with it had reduced
the invincible Campbell to this shaken wreck of his old
self. Mere bullets could tear wounds in flesh and break
bones; but mere bullets could not wreck the nerves of a man
so that his hand trembled as if he were drunk or hysterical
with weariness.</p>

<p>He tried to work out this problem. He conceived a man
of gigantic size, vast muscles, inexhaustible strength.
The power of a bear and the swift cunning of a wild
cat&mdash;such must have been the man who struck down Uncle
Bill and sent him home a shattered remnant of his old
self.</p>

<p>There was another mystery. Why did the destroyer not
finish his task? Why did he take pity on Uncle Bill
Campbell and bind up the wounds he had himself made? Here
the mind of Bull Hunter paused. He could not pass the
mysterious idea of another than himself pitying Uncle Bill.
It was pitying a hawk in the sky.</p>

<p>Harry was taking away the dishes and throwing them in
the little tub of lukewarm water where the grease would be
carelessly soused off them.</p>

<p>"Did you get up that stump?" asked Uncle Bill
suddenly.</p>

<p>There was a familiar ring in his voice. Woe to them if
they had not carried out his orders! All three of the young
men quaked, and Bull laid aside his book.</p>

<p>"We done it," answered Joe in a quavering voice.</p>

<p>"You done it?" asked Bill.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we dug her pretty well clear, then Bull pulled
her up."</p>

<p>Some of the wrath ebbed out of the face of Bill as
he glanced at the huge form of Bull. "Stand up!" he
ordered.</p>

<p>Bull arose.</p>

<p>The keen eye of the old man went over him from head to
foot slowly. "Someday," he said slowly, speaking entirely
to himself. "Someday&mdash; maybe!"</p>

<p>What he expected from Bull "someday" remained unknown.
The dishwashing was swiftly finished. Then Uncle Bill made
a feeble effort to get off his boots, but his strength had
been ebbing for some time. His sons dared not interfere as
the old man leaned slowly over and strove to tug the boot
from his wounded leg; but Bull remembered, all in a flood
of tenderness, some half-dozen small, kind things that his
uncle had said to him.</p>

<p>That was long, long ago, when the orphan came into the
Campbell family. In those days his stupidity had been
attributed largely to the speed with which he had grown,
and he was expected to become normally bright later on;
and in those days Bill Campbell occasionally let fall some
gentle word to the great boy with his big, frightened eyes.
And the half-dozen instances came back to Bull in this
moment.</p>

<p>He stepped between his cousins and laid his hand on the
foot of his uncle. It brought a snarl from the old man, a
snarl that made Bull straighten and step back, but he came
again and put aside the shaking hand of Uncle Bill. His
cousins stood at one side, literally quaking. It was the
first time that they had actually seen their father defied.
They saw the huge hand of Bull settle around the leg of
their father, well below the wound and then the grip closed
to avoid the danger of opening the wound when the boot was
worked off. After this he pulled the tight riding boot
slowly from the swollen foot.</p>

<p>Uncle Bill was no longer silent. The moment the big hand
of his nephew closed over his leg he launched a stream
of curses that chilled the blood and drove his own sons
farther back into the shadow of the corner. He demanded
that they stand forth and tear Bull limb from limb. He
disinherited them for cowardice. He threatened Bull with
a vengeance compared with which the thunderbolt would be
a feeble flare of light. He swore that he was entirely
capable of taking care of himself, that he would step down
into his grave sooner than be nursed and petted by any
living human being.</p>

<p>All the while, the great Bull leaned impassively over
the wounded man and finally worked the boot free. That was
not all. Uncle Bill had slipped over until he could reach
a billet of wood beside his bunk. He struck at Bull's head
with it, but the stick was brushed out of his palsied
fingers with a single gesture, and, while Uncle Bill
groaned with fury and impotence, Bull continued the task of
preparing him for bed. He straightened the old body of the
terrible Campbell; he heated water in the tub and washed
away stains and dirt; he took off the stained bandages and
replaced them with clean ones.</p>

<p>His cousins helped in the latter part of this work.
Weakness had reduced Uncle Bill to speechlessness. Finally
the head of Bill Campbell was laid on a double fold of
blanket in lieu of a pillow. A pipe had been tamped full
and lighted by Bull and&mdash;crowning insult&mdash;set
between Bill's teeth. When all this was accomplished
Bull retired to his corner, picked up his book, and was
instantly absorbed.</p>

<p>In the hushed atmosphere it seemed that a terrible blow
had fallen, and that another was about to fall. Harry
and Joe were as men stunned, but they looked upon their
father with a gathering complacency. They had found it
demonstrated that it was possible to disobey their father
without being instantly destroyed. They were taking the
lesson to heart. And indeed old Bill Campbell himself
seemed to be slowly admitting that he was beaten.</p>

<p>The illusion of absolute self-sufficiency, which he had
built up through the years for the sake of imposing upon
his sons and Bull Hunter, was now destroyed. At a single
stroke he had been exposed as an old man, already beaten
in battle by a foeman and now requiring as much care as a
sick woman. The shame of it burned in him; but the comfort
of the smoothed bunk and the filled pipe between his teeth
was a blessing. He found to his own surprise that he was
not hating Bull with a tithe of his usual vigor. He began
to realize that he had come to the end of his period of
command. When he left that sickbed he could only advise.</p>

<p>As a king about to die he looked at his heirs and
found them strong and sufficient and pleasing to the eye.
Nowhere in the mountains were there two boys as tall, as
straight, as deadly with rifle and revolver, as fierce,
as relentless, as these two boys of his. He had sharpened
their tempers, and he rejoiced in the sullen ferocity with
which they looked at him now, unloving, cunning, biding
their time and finding that it had almost come. But he was
not yet done. His body was wrecked; there remained his
mind, and they would find it a great power. But he did not
talk until the lights had been put out and the three youths
were in their separate bunks. Then, without the light to
show them his helpless body, in the darkness, which would
give his mind a freer play, he began to tell his story.</p>

<p>It was a long narrative. Far back in the years he had
prospected with a youth named Pete Reeve. They had located
a claim and they had gone to town together to celebrate.
In the celebration he had drunk with Reeve till the boy
stupefied. Then he had induced Reeve to gamble for his
share of the claim and had won it. Afterward Pete swore to
be even with him. But the years had gone by without another
meeting of the men.</p>

<p>Only today, riding through the mountains, he had
come on a dried-up wisp of a man with long, iron-gray
hair, a sharp, withered face, and hands like the claws
of a bird. He rode a fine bay gelding, and had stopped
Bill to ask some questions about the region above the
timberline because he was drifting south and intended
to cross the summits. Bill had described the way, and
suddenly, out of their talk, came the revelation of their
identities&mdash;the one was Bill Campbell, the other was
Pete Reeve.</p>

<p>At this point in the story Bull heaved himself slowly,
softly up on one arm to listen. He was beginning to get the
full sense of the words for the first time. This narrative
was like a book done in a commoner language.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>

<p class="first">THE tale halted. To be defeated is one
thing; to be forced to confess defeat is another. Uncle
Bill determined on the bitterer alternative.</p>

<p>"He made a clean fight," declared Uncle Bill. "First
he cussed me out proper. Then he went for his gat and he
beat me to the draw. They ain't no disgrace to that. You'll
learn pretty soon that anybody might get beaten sooner or
later&mdash;if he fights enough men. And my gun hung in the
leather. Before I got it on him he'd shot me clean through
the right shoulder&mdash;a placed shot, boys. He wanted to
land me there. It tumbled me off my hoss. I rolled away and
tried to get to my gun that had fallen on the ground. He
shot me ag'in through the leg and stopped me.</p>

<p>"Then he got off his hoss and fixed up the wounds. He
done a good job, as you seen. 'Bill' says he, 'you ain't
dead; you're worse'n dead. That right arm of yours is going
to be stiff the rest of your days. You're a one-armed man
from now on, and that one arm is the worst you got.'</p>

<p>"That was why he sent me home alive. To make me live and
keep hating him, the same's he'd lived and hated me. But he
made a mistake. Pete Reeve is a wise fox, but he made one
mistake. He forgot that I might have somebody to send on
his trail. He didn't know that I had two boys I'd raised
so's they was each better with a gun nor me. He didn't
dream of that, curse him! But when you, Harry, or you, Joe,
pump the lead into him, shoot him so's he'll live long
enough to know who killed him and why!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, there was a quality in his voice that
seemed to find the boys in the darkness and point each of
them out. "Which of you takes the trail?"</p>

<p>A little silence followed. Bull wondered at it.</p>

<p>"He's gone by way of Johnstown," continued the wounded
man. "If one of you cuts across the summit toward Shantung
he's pretty sure to cut in across Pete's trail. Which is
goin' to start? Well, you can match for the chance! Because
him that comes back with Pete Reeve marked off the slate is
a man!"</p>

<p>That chilly little silence made Bull's heart beat.
To be called a man, to be praised by stern Bill
Campbell&mdash;surely these were things to make anyone risk
death!</p>

<p>"Is that the Pete Reeve," said Harry's voice, "that shot
up Mike Rivers over the hill to the Tompkins place, about
four year back?"</p>

<p>"That's him. Why?"</p>

<p>Again the silence. Then Bull heard the old man cursing
softly&mdash; meditatively, one might almost have said.</p>

<p>"Cut across for Johnstown," said Joe softly, "in a storm
like this? They won't be no trails left to find above the
timberline. It'd be sure death. Listen!"</p>

<p>There was a lull in the wind, and in the breeze that
was left, they could hear the whisper of the snow crushing
steadily against the window.</p>

<p>"It's heavy fall, right enough," declared Harry.</p>

<p>"And this Pete Reeve&mdash;why, he's a gunfighter,
Dad."</p>

<p>"And what are you?" asked the old man. "Ain't I labored
and slaved all my life to make you handy with guns? What
for d'you think I wasted all them hours showin' you how to
pull a trigger and where to shoot and how to get a gun out
of the leather?"</p>

<p>"To kill for meat," suggested Harry.</p>

<p>"Meat, nothing! The kind of meat I mean walks on two
feet and fights back."</p>

<p>"Maybe, if we started together&mdash;" ventured Joe.</p>

<p>His father broke in, "Boy, I ain't going to send out a
pack of men to run down Pete Reeve. He met me single and
he fought me clean, and he's going to be pulled down by no
pack of yaller dogs! Go one of you alone or else both of
you stay here."</p>

<p>He waited, but there was no response. "Is this the way
my blood is showin' up in my sons? Is this the result of
all my trainin'?"</p>

<p>After that there was no more talk. The long silence was
not broken by even the sound of breathing until someone
began to snore. Then Bull knew that the sleep of the night
had settled down.</p>

<p>He lay with his hands folded behind his head, thinking.
They were willing enough to go together to do this
difficult thing. But had they not lifted together at the
stump and failed to do the thing which he had done single-
handed? That thought stuck in his memory and would not
out. And suppose he, Bull, were to accomplish this great
feat and return to the shack? Would not Bill Campbell feel
doubly repaid for the living he had furnished for his
nephew? More than once the grim old man had cursed the luck
that saddled him with a stupid incubus. But the curses
would turn to compliments if Bull left this little man,
this catlike and dangerous fighter, this Pete Reeve, dead
on the trail.</p>

<p>Not that all this was clear in the mind of Bull, but he
felt something like a command pushing him on that difficult
south trail, through the storm and the snow that would now
be piling above the timberline. He waited until there was
no noise but the snoring of the sleepers and the rush and
roar of the wind which continually set something stirring
in the room. These sounds served to cover effectually any
noises he made as he felt about and made up his small
pack. His old canvas coat, his most treasured article of
apparel, he took down from the hook where it accumulated
dust from month to month. His ancient, secondhand cartridge
belt with the antiquated revolver he removed from another
hook&mdash;he had never been given enough ammunition to
become a shot of any quality&mdash;and he pushed quickly
into the night.</p>

<p>The moment he was through the door, the storm caught him
in the face a stinging blow, and the rush of snow chilled
his skin. That stinging blow steadied to a blast. It was
a tremendous, heavy fall. The wind had scoured the drifts
from the clearing and was already banking them around the
little house. In the morning, as like as not, the boys
would have to dig their way out.</p>

<p>He went straight to the horse shed for his snowshoes
that hung on the wall there. Ordinary snowshoes would not
endure his ponderous weight, and Uncle Bill Campbell had
fashioned these himself, heavy and uncomfortable articles,
but capable of enduring the strain.</p>

<p>Fumbling his way down behind the stalls, Bill's roan
lashed out at him with savage heels; but Maggie, the old
draft horse, whinnied softly, greeting that familiar heavy
step. He tied the snowshoes on his back and then stopped
for a last word to Maggie. She raised her head and dropped
it clumsily on his shoulder. She was among the little,
agile mountain ponies what he was among men, and their bulk
had rendered each of them more or less helpless. There
seemed to be a mute understanding between them, and it was
never more apparent than when Maggie whinnied gently in his
ear. He stroked her big, bony head, a lump forming in his
throat. If the bullets of little Pete Reeve dropped him in
some far-off trail, the old-broken-down horse would be the
only living creature that would mourn for him.</p>

<p>Outside, the night and the storm swallowed him at once.
Before he had gone fifty feet the house was out of sight.
Then, entering the forest of balsam firs, the force of
the wind was lessened, and he made good time up the first
part of the grade. There would probably be no use for the
snowshoes in this region of broken shrubbery before he came
to the timberline.</p>

<p>He swept on with a lengthening stride. He knew this
part of the country like a book, of course, and he seldom
stumbled, save when he came out into a clearing and the
wind smote at him from an unexpected angle. In one of
these clearings he stopped and took stock of his position.
Far away to the west and the south, the head of Scalped
Mountain was lost in dim, rushing clouds. He must make for
that goal.</p>

<p>Progress became less easy almost at once. The trees that
grew in this elevated region were not tall enough to act as
wind breaks; they were hardly more than shrubs a great deal
of the time, and merely served to force him into detours
around dense hedges. Sometimes, in a clearing, he found
himself staggering to the knees in a compacted drift of
snow; sometimes an immense sheet of snow was picked up by
the wind and flung in his face like a blanket.</p>

<p>Indeed the cold and the snow were nothing compared with
the wind. It was now reaching the proportions of a westerly
storm of the first magnitude. Off the towering slopes
above, it came with the chill of the snow and with flying
bits of sand, scooped up from around the base of trees, or
with a shower of twigs. Many a time he had to throw up his
arms across his face before he leaned and thrust on into
the teeth of the blast.</p>

<p>But he was growing accustomed to seeing through this
veil of snow and thick darkness. All things were dreamlike
in dimness, of course, but he could make out terrific cloud
effects, as the clouds gushed over the summit and down
the slope a little way like the smoke of enormous guns;
and again a pyramid of mist was like a false mountain
before him, a mountain that took on movement and rushed to
overwhelm him, only to melt away and become simply a shadow
among shadows above his head.</p>

<p>Once or twice before the dawn, he rested, not from
weariness perhaps, but from lack of breath, turning his
back to the west and bowing his head. Walking into the wind
it had become positively difficult to draw breath!</p>

<p>Still it gained power incredibly. Up the side of Scalped
Mountain it was a steady weight pressing against him rather
than a wind. And now and then, when the weight relaxed, he
stumbled forward on his knees. For there was now hardly
any shelter. He was approaching the timberline where trees
stand as high as a man and little higher.</p>

<p>Dawn found him at the edge of the tree line. He flung
himself on his face, his head on his arms, to rest and wait
until the treacherous time of dawn should have passed.
While the day grew steadily his heart sank. He needed the
rest, but the cold bit into him while he lay extended, and
the peril of the summit would be before him for his march
of the day. The wind mourned over him as if it anticipated
his defeat. Never had there been such wind, he thought.
It screamed above him. It dropped away in sudden lulls of
more appalling silence. Then, far off, he would hear a
wave of the storm begin, wash across a crest, thunder in a
canyon, and then break on the timberline with a prolonged
and mighty roaring. Those giant approaches made him hold
his breath, and when the wave of confusion passed, he found
himself often breathless.</p>

<p>Day came. He was on the very verge of the line with
a dense fence of stunted trees just before him and the
wilderness of snow beyond, sloping up to the crest,
outlined in white against the solid gray sky. The Spartans
of the forest were around him&mdash;fir, pine, spruce,
birch, and trembling little aspens up there among the
stoutest. All were of one height, clean-shaven by the
volleys of the wind-driven sand and pebbles that clipped
off any treetop that aspired above the mass. In solid
numbers was their salvation, and they grew dense as grass,
two feet high on the battlefront. They were carved by that
wind, for all storms came here out of the west, and the
storm face of every tree was denuded of branches. To the
east the foliage streamed away. Even in calm weather those
trees spoke of storm.</p>

<p>Bull Hunter sat up to put on his snowshoes. It was a
white world below him and above. Winter, which a day before
had vanished, now came back with a rush off the summits,
where its snows were still piled. Again the heart of the
big man quaked. Down in the hollow, over that ridge, was
the house of the Campbells. They would be getting up now.
Joe would be making the fire, and Harry slicing the bacon.
It made a cheerful picture to Bull. He could close his
eyes and hear the fire snap and see the stove steam with
smoke through every fissure before the draft caught in the
chimney. From the shed came the neigh of Maggie, calling
softly to him.</p>

<p>He shook his head with a groan, stood up, and strode out
of the timber into the summit lands. It was a great desert.
Never could it be construed as a place for life. Even
lichens were almost out of place here, and what folly could
lead a man across the shifting snows? But to be called a
man, to be admired in silence, to be asked for opinions,
to be deferred to&mdash;this was a treasure worth any
price! He bowed himself to the wind again and made for the
summit with the peculiar stride which a man must use with
snowshoes.</p>

<p>He dared not slacken his efforts now. The cold had
been increasing, and to pause meant peril of freezing. It
was a highly electrified air, and the result was a series
of maddening mirages. He stumbled over solid rocks where
nothing seemed to be in his way; and again what seemed
a rock of huge size was nothing at all. Bull discovered
that what seemed firm ground beneath him, as he started to
round a precipice, might after all be the effect of the
mirage.</p>

<p>Added to this was another difficulty. As he wound
slowly, about midday, up the last reach, with the summit
just above him, the wind carried masses of cloud over
the crest and into his face. He walked alternately in a
bewildering, driving fog and then in an air made crazy with
electricity. Again and again, from one side or the other,
he started when the storm boomed and cannonaded down a
ravine and then belched out into the open. All this time
the babel of the winds overhead never ceased, and the force
of the storm cut up under him with such violence that he
was almost raised from the earth.</p>

<p>Then an unexpected barrier obtruded&mdash;a literal
mountain of ice was before him. The snow of the recent fall
had been whipped away, and the surface of the mountain,
here perilously steep, was now sleek and solid with ice.
Bull looked gloomily toward the summit so close above him,
and the ice glimmered in the dull light. There was only one
way to make even the attempt. He sat down, took off his
snowshoes, strapped them to his back, and began to work his
way up the slope, battering out each foothold with the head
of his ax. It was possible to ascend in this manner, but it
would be practically impossible to descend.</p>

<p>Once committed to this way, he had either to go on to
the summit, or else perish. Working slowly, with little
possible muscular exercise to warm him, he began to grow
chilled and the wind-driven cold numbed his ears. But, more
than that, the wind was now a grim peril, for, from time
to time, it swerved and leaped on him heavily from the
side. Once, off balance, he looked back at the dazzling
slope below him. He would be a shapeless mass of flesh long
before he tumbled to the bottom.</p>

<p>Vaguely, as he hewed his footholds and worked his way
up, he yearned for the cleverness of Harry or the wit of
Joe. What an ally either of them would be! That he was
undertaking a task from which either of them would have
shrunk in horror never occurred to him. Yonder, beyond the
summit, lay his destiny &mdash;Johnstown&mdash;and this was
the way toward it; it was a simple thing to Bull. He could
no more vary from his course than a magnetic needle can
vary from its pole.</p>

<p>Suddenly he came on a break in the solid face of the
ice. Above him was a narrow rift through the ice to the
gravel beneath; how it was made, Bull could not guess.
But he took advantage of it. Presently he was striding
on toward the summit, beating his hands to restore the
circulation and gingerly rubbing his ears.</p>

<p>There was a magical change as he reached the summit and
sat down behind some rocks to regain his breath and quiet
his shaken nerves. The clouds split apart in the zenith;
the sun burst through; on both sides the broad mountain
billowed away to white lowlands; the air was alive with
little, brilliant spots of electricity.</p>

<p>It cheered Bull Hunter vastly. The gale, which was
tumbling the clouds down the arch of the sky and toward the
east, was more mighty than ever, but he put his head down
to it confidently and began the descent.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was more snow on this side, and to
travel through it he soon found that he must put on the
snowshoes again; but after that the descent was actually
restful compared with the labors of the climb. Yonder
was the dark streak of the timberline again. Far down
the valley he watched it curving in and out along the
mountainside like a water level. Below was the darkness
of the forest where other things lived, and where Bull
could live more easily, also. Never had trees seemed such
beautiful and friendly things to him.</p>

<p>Once a thought stopped him completely. He was in a
new world. He was seeing everything for the first time.
On other days he had gone out with others. Under their
guidance, not trusted to undertake an expedition by
himself, he looked at nothing until it was pointed out
to him, heard nothing that was not first called to his
attention. He had always wondered at the acuteness of the
senses of all other men. But now, looking on the mountains
for himself, he decided, with a start of the heart, that
they were beautiful &mdash;beautiful and terrible at once,
with the reality that he had never found in his books. What
leveled spear of a knight, in the pages of romance, could
equal the invisible thrust of this wind?</p>

<p>He reached the timberline. Looking back, he saw the
summit, a brilliant line of white against a blue sky. Again
the heart of Bull Hunter leaped. Here was a great treasure
that he had taken in with one grasp of the eyes and which
he could never lose!</p>

<p>He turned down the valley. Where it swerved out into the
lower plain, stood Johnstown, and there he was to cross the
flight of Pete Reeve, if Pete were indeed flying. But it
was incredible that the man who had struck down Uncle Bill
Campbell should flee from any man or number of men.</p>

<p>He had reached the bottom of the narrow valley. A dull
noise came down to him from the mountain in the lull of the
wind. He looked up.</p>

<p>Far away, miles and miles, near the summit of Scalped
Mountain, a snaky form of mist was twisting swiftly down.
He looked curiously. The thing grew, traveling with great
speed that increased with every moment. It increased
&mdash;it gained velocity&mdash;a snowslide!</p>

<p>He watched it in doubt. It was twisting like a snake
down the farther side of the mountain, but, in his
experience, slides were as treacherous as serpents. Bull
started hastily for a low cliff that stood up from the
floor of the valley, clear of the trees.</p>

<p>He had not gone far when the wind fell away to a
whisper, and a dull roaring caught his ear. He looked back
over his shoulder in alarm. A great wall of white was
shooting down the mountainside. The little slide of surface
snow, which had twisted across the surface of the old snows
of the winter, had been gaining in weight, in momentum,
picking up claws of shrubbery, teeth of stone, and eating
through layer after layer of the old snow, packed hard
as ice. Now it was a roaring mass with a front steadily
increasing in height, and far away in the rear it tossed
up a tail of snow dust, a flying mist that gave Bull an
impression of speed greater than the main wall of the snow
itself.</p>

<p>The noise grew amazingly, and coming in range of the
opposite wall of the valley, a low and steadily increasing
thunder poured into the ears of Bull. It was a fascinating
thing to watch, and at this distance to the side he was
quite safe. But at the very moment that he reached this
decision, the front of the slide smashed with a noise like
volleyed canyon against the side of a hill, tossed immense
arms of white in the air, floundered, and then veered with
the speed of an express train rounding a curve and rocked
away down the slope straight for Bull. Turned cold with
dread, he saw it hit the timberline with a great crashing,
and the dark forms of the trees were dashed up by the
running mass of stones and then swallowed in the boiling
front of the slide.</p>

<p>He waited to see no more, but dashed on for the saving
cliff. Once his back was turned it seemed that the slide
gained speed. The immense roaring literally leaped on him
from behind, and in the roar, his senses were drowned. He
could feel his knees weaken and buckle, but the cliff,
now just before him, gave him fresh strength. But was the
cliff high enough? He hurried up to higher ground and flung
himself prostrate. The front of the slide was cutting
down the heavily forested slope as though the trees were
blades of grass before a keen scythe. The noise passed all
description.</p>

<p>Once he thought the mass was changing direction. It put
out a massive arm to the left, licked down five hundred
trees at a gulp, and then, smashing its fist into a
hillside, flung back into the valley floor, tossing the
great trees in its top and poured straight at him. He
watched it in one of those dazes during which one sees
everything. The whole body came like water down a chute,
but one part of the front wall spilled out ahead and then
another, and then the top, overtaking the rest, toppled
crashing to the bottom. And so it rushed out of sight
beneath the cliff. But would it wash over the top?</p>

<p>The first answer was an impact that shook the ground
under him, and then he heard a noise like a huge ripping
explosion. A dozen lofty geysers of snow streamed up into
the air, dazzling against the sun, misty at the edges
of each column, whose center was solid tons and tons of
snow. Old pines and spruces, their branches shaved away in
the tumult of the slide, were picked up and hurled like
javelins over the cliff; a shower of fragments beat on the
body of Bull; and then the main mass of snow washed up over
the edge of the cliff in a great mound, and the slide was
ended.</p>

<p>He crawled slowly back to his feet. Far up the
mountainside, beginning in a point, the track of the slide
swept down in a broadening scar, black and raw, across
forest and snow. Far down the valley the last echoes of
thunder were passing away to a murmur, and the valley
floor, beneath the cliff, was a mass of snow and tree
trunks.</p>

<p>Bull took off the snowshoes and climbed along the valley
wall until he could descend to the clear floor beneath him.
Then he headed down toward Johnstown.</p>

<p>It was well past midday when he escaped the slide; it
was the beginning of night when, at the conclusion of that
first heroic march, he reached Johnstown. With hunger his
stomach cleaved to his back, and his knees were weak with
the labor.</p>

<p>Stamping through the snow to the hotel he asked the
idlers around the stove, "Has any of you gents seen a man
named Pete Reeve pass through this town?"</p>

<p>They looked at him in amazement. He had closed the door
behind him, and now, with his battered hat pushed high on
his head, he seemed taller than the entrance&mdash;taller
and as wide, a mountain of a man. The efforts of the march
had collected a continual frown on his forehead, and as he
peered about from face to face, no one for a moment was
able to answer, but each looked to his companion.</p>

<p>It was the proprietor who answered finally. Talk was
his commercial medium and staff of life. "What sort of a
looking man, captain?"</p>

<p>Bull blinked at him. He was not used to honorary
epithets such as this, and he searched the face of the
proprietor carefully to detect mockery. To his surprise the
other showed signs of what Bull dimly recognized as fear.
Fear of him&mdash;of Bull Hunter!</p>

<p>"The way you look at me," said the other and laughed
uneasily, "I figure it's pretty lucky that I ain't this
here Pete Reeve. That so, boys?"</p>

<p>The boys joined in the laughter, but they kept it
subdued, their eyes upon the giant at the door. He was
leaning against the wall, and the sight of his outspread
hand was far from reassuring.</p>

<p>But Bull went on to describe his man. "Not very big;
hands like the claws of a bird's; iron-gray hair; quick
ways." That was Uncle Bill's description.</p>

<p>"Sure he's been here," said the owner. "I recognized
him right off. He was through about dusk. He came over the
mountains and just got past the summit, he said, before
the storm hit. Lucky, eh?" He looked at the battered coat
of Bull. "Kind of appears like you mightn't of been so
lucky?"</p>

<p>"Me?" asked Bull gently. "Nope. I was at the timberline
on the other side about daybreak today."</p>

<p>There was a sudden and chilly silence; men looked at one
another. Obviously no man could have traveled that distance
between dawn and dark, but it was as well not to express
disbelief to a man who could tell a lie as big as his
body.</p>

<p>"I got to eat," said Bull.</p>

<p>The proprietor jumped out of his chair. "I can fix you
up, son."</p>

<p>He led the way, Bull following with his enormous
strides, and, as the floor creaked under him, the eyes
of the others jerked after him, stride by stride. It was
beginning to seem possible that this man had done what he
said he had done. When the door slammed behind him and his
steps went creaking through the room beyond, a mutter of a
hum arose around the stove.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it was the beginning of the great
legend that was finally to bulk around the name of the big
man. And it was fitting that the huge figure of Bull Hunter
should have come upon the attention of men in this way,
descending out of the storm and the mountains.</p>

<p>That he had done something historic was far from the
mind of Bull as he stalked into the dining room.</p>

<p>"You sit right down here," his host was saying, placing
a chair at the table.</p>

<p>Bull tried the chair with his hand. It groaned and
squeaked under the weight. "Chairs don't seem to be made
for me," he said simply. "Besides I'm more used to sitting
on the floor." He dropped to the floor accordingly, with
the effect of a small earthquake. The proprietor stared,
but he swallowed his astonishment. "What you'd like to eat
is something hearty, I figure."</p>

<p>"What you got?" said Bull.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Jarney come in this morning with a dozen
fresh eggs. Got some prime bacon, too, and some jerky
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That dozen eggs," said Bull thoughtfully, "will start
me, and then a platter of bacon, and you might mix up a
bowl of flapjacks. You ain't got a quart or so of canned
milk, partner?"</p>

<p>The proprietor could only nod, for he dared not
trust his voice. Fleeing to the kitchen he repeated the
prodigious order to his wife. Then he circled by a back
way and communicated the tidings to the "boys" around the
stove.</p>

<p>"A couple of dozen eggs, he says to me, and a few
pounds of beef and three or four quarts of milk and a bowl
of flapjacks and a platter of bacon," was the way the
second version of the historic order for food came to the
idlers.</p>

<p>Half a dozen of the men risked the cold and the wind to
steal around to the side of the house and peer through the
window at the huge, bunched figure that sat on the floor.
They found him with his chin dropped upon the burly fist
and a frown on his forehead, for Bull was thinking.</p>

<p>He would have been glad to have found Pete Reeve in
Johnstown and have the matter over with. But, after all, it
was beginning to occur to him that it might not be wise to
kill the man in the presence of other people. They might
attempt to correct him with the assistance of a rope and
a limb of a tree. Somewhere he must cut in ahead of this
Reeve and start out at him if possible. As for his ability
to keep pace with a horse he had no doubt that he could do
it fairly well. More than once he had gone out on foot,
while Harry and Joe rode, and he had pressed the little
ponies, bearing their riders slowly up and down the slopes,
to keep pace with him. On the level, of course, it was a
different matter, but in broken country he more than kept
up.</p>

<p>"Have you got a grudge agin' Reeve?" asked the host, as
he brought in the fried eggs.</p>

<p>"Maybe," admitted Bull, and instantly he began to attack
the food.</p>

<p>The proprietor watched with a growing awe. No chinook
ever ate snow as this hungry giant melted food to
nothingness. He came back with the first stack of flapjacks
and bacon and more questions. "But I'd think that a gent
like you'd be pretty careful about tangling with Pete
Reeve&mdash;him being so handy with a gun and you such a
tolerable big target."</p>

<p>"I've figured that all out," said Bull calmly. "But
they's so much of me to kill that I don't figure one bullet
could do the work. Do you?"</p>

<p>The eyes of the proprietor grew large. He swallowed, and
before he could answer Bull continued in the exposition of
his theory. "Before he shoots the next shot, maybe I can
get my hands on him."</p>

<p>"You going to fight him bare hands agin' a gun?"</p>

<p>"You see," said Bull apologetically, "I ain't much good
with a gun, but I feel sort of curious about what would
happen if I got my grip on a man."</p>

<p>And that was the foundation on which another section of
the Bull Hunter legend was built.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>

<p class="first">THE bed on which Bull Hunter reposed his
bulk that night was not the cot to which he was shown by
his host. One glance at the spindling wooden legs of the
canvas-bottomed cot was enough for Bull, and having wrapped
himself in the covers he lay down on the floor and was
instantly asleep.</p>

<p>While it was still dark, he wakened out of a dream in
which Pete Reeve seemed to be riding far&mdash;far away on
the rim of the world. Ten minutes later Bull was on the
trail out of Johnstown. There was only one trail for a
horseman south of Johnstown, and that trail followed the
windings of the valley. Bull planned to push across the
ragged peaks of the Little Cloudy Mountains and head off
the fugitive at Glenn Crossing.</p>

<p>Two days of stern labor went into the next burst. He
followed the cold stars by night and the easy landmarks by
day, and for food he had the stock of raisins he had bought
at Johnstown. He came out of the heights and dropped down
into Glenn Crossing in the gloom of the second evening. But
raisins are meager support for such a bulk as that of Bull
Hunter. It was a gaunt-faced giant who looked in at the
door of the shop where the blacksmith was working late. The
mechanic looked up with a start at the deep voice of the
stranger, but he managed to stammer forth his tidings. Such
a man as Pete Reeve had indeed been in Glenn Crossing, but
he had gone on at the very verge of day and night.</p>

<p>Bull Hunter set his teeth, for there was no longer a
possibility of cutting off Pete Reeve by crossing country.
The immense labors of the last three days had merely served
to put him on the heels of the horseman, and now he must
follow straight down country and attempt to match his long
legs against the speed of a fine horse. He drew a deep
breath and plunged into the night out of Glenn Crossing, on
the south trail. At least he would make one short, stiff
march before the weariness overtook him.</p>

<p>That weariness clouded his brain ten miles out. He built
a fire in a cover of pines and slept beside it. Before
dawn he was up and out again. In the first gray of the
daylight he reached a little store at a crossroad, and
here he paused for breakfast. A tousled girl, rubbing the
sleep out of her eyes, served him in the kitchen. The first
glimpse of the hollow cheeks and the unshaven face of Bull
Hunter quite awakened her. Bull could feel her watching
him, as she glided about the room. He sunk his head between
his shoulders and glared down at the table. No doubt she
would begin to gibe at him before long. Most women did.
He prepared himself to meet with patience that incredible
sting and penetrating hurt of a woman's mockery.</p>

<p>But there was no mockery forthcoming. The sun was
still not up when he paid his bill and hastened to the
door of the old building. Quick footsteps followed him,
a hand touched his shoulders, and he turned and looked
suspiciously down into the face of the girl. It was a
frightened face, he thought, and very pretty. At some
interval between the time when he first saw her and the
present, she had found time to rearrange her hair and make
it smooth. Color was pulsing in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Stranger," she said softly, "what are you running away
from?"</p>

<p>The question slowly penetrated the mind of Bull; he
was still bewildered by the change in her&mdash;something
electric, to be felt rather than noted with the eye.</p>

<p>"They ain't any reason for hurrying on," she urged.
"I&mdash;I can hide you, easy. Nobody could find where I'll
put you, and there you can rest up. You must be tolerable
tired."</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it. There was kindness as well
as anxiety in her voice. For the second time in his entire
life, Bull decided that a woman could be something more
than an annoyance. She was placing a value on him, just as
Jessie, three days before, had placed a value on him; and
it disturbed Bull. For so many years, he had been mocked
and scorned by his uncle and cousins that deep in his mind
was engraved the certainty that he was useless. He decided
to hurry on before the girl found out the truth.</p>

<p>"I can still walk," he said, "and, while I can walk,
I got to go south. But&mdash;you gimme heart, lady. You
gimme a pile of heart to keep going. Maybe"&mdash;he
paused, uncertain what to say next, and yet obviously she
expected something more&mdash;"I'll get a chance to come
back this way, and if I do, I'll see you! You can lay to
that&mdash;I'll see you!"</p>

<p>He was gone before she could answer, and he was
wondering why she had looked down with that sudden color
and that queer, pleased smile. It would be long before Bull
understood, but, even without understanding, he found that
his heart was lighter and an odd warmth suffused him.</p>

<p>The rising of the sun found him in the pale desert with
the magic of the hills growing distant behind him, and he
settled to a different step through the thin sand&mdash;a
short, choppy step. His weight was against him here, but
it would be even a greater disadvantage to a horseman, and
with this in mind, he pressed steadily south.</p>

<p>Every day on that south trail was like a year in the
life of Bull. Heat and thirst wasted him, the constant
labor of the march hardened his muscles, and he got that
forward look about his eyes, which comes with shadows under
the lids and a constant frown on the forehead. It was long
afterward that men checked up his march from date to date
and discovered that the distance between the shack of Bill
Campbell and Halstead in the South was one hundred and
fifty miles over bitter mountains and burning desert, and
that Bull Hunter had made the distance in five days.</p>

<p>All this was learned and verified later when Bull was a
legend. When he strode into Halstead on that late afternoon
no one had ever heard of the man out of the mountains. He
was simply an oddity in a country where oddities draw small
attention.</p>

<p>Yet a rumor advanced before Bull. A child, playing in
the incredible heat of the sun, saw the dusty giant heaving
in the distance and ran to its mother, frightened, and the
worn-faced mother came to the porch and shaded her eyes
to look. She passed on the word with a call that traveled
from house to house. So that, when Bull entered the long,
irregular street of Halstead, he found it lined on either
side by children, old men, women. It was almost as though
they had heard of the thing he had come to do and were
there to watch.</p>

<p>Bull shrank from their eyes. He would far rather have
slipped around the back of the village and gone toward its
center unobserved. A pair of staring eyes to Bull was like
the pointing of a loaded gun. He put unspoken sentences
upon every tongue, and the sentences were those he had
heard so often from his uncle and his uncle's sons.</p>

<p>"Too big to be any good."</p>

<p>"Bull's got the size of a hoss, and as a hoss he'd do
pretty well, but he ain't no account as a man."</p>

<p>His life had been paved with such burning remarks as
these. Many an evening had been long agony to him as the
three sat about and baited him. He hurried down the street,
the pulverized sand squirting up about his heavy boots and
drifting in a mist behind him. When he was gone an old man
came out and measured those great strides with his eye and
then stretched his legs vainly to cover the same marks. But
this, of course, Bull did not see, and he would not have
understood it, had he seen, except as a mockery.</p>

<p>He paused in front of the hotel veranda, an awful figure
to behold. His canvas coat was rolled and tied behind his
sweating shoulders; his too-short sleeves had bothered him
and they were now cut off at the elbow and exposed the
sun-blackened forearms; his overalls streamed in rags over
his scarred boots. He pushed the battered hat far back on
his head and looked at the silent, attentive line of idlers
who sat on the veranda.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, gents," he said mildly. "But maybe one of
you might know of a little gent with iron-gray hair and a
thin face and quick ways of acting and little, thin hands."
He illustrated his meaning by extending his own huge paws.
"His name is Pete Reeve."</p>

<p>That name caused a sharp shifting of glances, not at
Bull, but from man to man. A tall fellow rose. He advanced
with his thumbs hooked importantly in the arm holes of
his vest and braced his legs apart as he faced Bull. The
elevation of the veranda floor raised him so that he was
actually some inches above the head of his interlocutor,
and the tall man was deeply grateful for that advantage. He
was, in truth, a little vain of his own height, and to have
to look up to anyone irritated him beyond words. Having
established his own superior position, he looked the giant
over from head to foot. He kept one eye steadily on Bull,
as though afraid that the big man might dodge out of sight
and elude him.</p>

<p>"And what might you have to do with Pete Reeve?" he
asked. "Mightn't you be a partner of Pete's? Kind of looks
like you was following him sort of eager, friend."</p>

<p>While this question was being asked, Bull saw that the
line of idlers settled forward in their chairs to hear the
answer. It puzzled him. For some mysterious reason these
men disapproved of any one who was intimately acquainted
with Pete Reeve, it seemed. He looked blandly upon the tall
man.</p>

<p>"I never seen Pete Reeve," said Bull apologetically.</p>

<p>"Ah? Yet you're follerin' him hotfoot?"</p>

<p>"I was aiming to see him, you know," answered Bull.</p>

<p>The tall man regarded him with eyes that began to
twinkle beneath his frown. Then he jerked his head aside
and cast at his audience a prodigious wink. The cloudy eyes
of Bull had assured him that he had to do with a simpleton,
and he was inviting the others in on the game.</p>

<p>"You never seen him?" he asked gruffly, turning back to
Bull. "You expect me to believe talk like that? Young man,
d'you know who I am?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," murmured Bull, overawed and drawing back a
pace.</p>

<p>The action drew a chuckle from the crowd. Some of the
idlers even rose and sauntered to the edge of the veranda,
the better to see the baiting of the giant. His prodigious
size made his timidity the more amusing.</p>

<p>"You dunno, eh?" asked the other. "Well, son, I'm
Sheriff Bill Anderson!" He waited to see the effect of this
portentous announcement.</p>

<p>"I never heard tell of any Sheriff Bill Anderson," said
Bull in the same mild voice.</p>

<p>The sheriff gasped. The idlers hastily veiled their
mouths with much coughing and clearing of the throat. It
seemed that the tables had been subtly turned upon the
sheriff.</p>

<p>"You!" exclaimed the sheriff, extending a bony arm. "I
got to tell you, partner, that I'm a pile suspicious. I'm
suspicious of anybody that's a friend of Pete Reeve. How
long have you knowed him?"</p>

<p>Bull was very anxious to pacify the tall man. He shifted
his weight to the other foot. "Something less'n nothing,"
he hastened to explain. "I ain't never seen him."</p>

<p>"And why d'you want to see him? What d'you know about
him?"</p>

<p>It flashed through the mind of Bull that it would be
useless to tell what he knew of Pete. Obviously nobody
would believe what he could tell of how Reeve had met
and shot down Uncle Bill Campbell. For Bill Campbell was
a historic figure as a fighter in the mountain regions,
and surely his face must be bright even at this distance
from his home. That he could have walked beyond the sphere
of Campbell's fame in five days never occurred to Bull
Hunter.</p>

<p>"I dunno nothing good," he confessed.</p>

<p>There was a change in the sheriff. He descended from the
floor of the veranda with a stiff-legged hop and took Bull
by the arm, leading him down the street.</p>

<p>"Son," he said earnestly, walking down the street with
Bull, "d'you know anything agin' this Pete Reeve? I want to
know because I got Pete behind the bars for murder!"</p>

<p>"Murder?" asked Bull.</p>

<p>"Murder&mdash;regular murder&mdash;something he'll hang
for. And if you got any inside information that I can use
agin' him, why I'll use it and I'll be mighty grateful for
it! You see everybody knows Pete Reeve. Everybody knows
that, for all these years, he's been going around killing
and maiming men, and nobody has been able to bring him up
for anything worse'n self- defense. But now I think I got
him to rights, and I want to hang him for it, stranger,
partly because it'd be a feather in my cap, and partly
because it'd be doing a favor for every good, law-abiding
citizen in these parts. So do what you can to help me,
stranger, and I'll see that your time ain't wasted."</p>

<p>There was something very wheedling and insinuating about
all this talk. It troubled Bull. His strangely obscure life
had left him a child in many important respects, and he had
a child's instinctive knowledge of the mental processes of
others. In this case he felt a profound distrust. There
was something wrong about this sheriff, his instincts told
him&mdash;something gravely wrong. He disliked the man who
had started to ridicule him before many men and was now so
confidential, asking his help.</p>

<p>"Sheriff Anderson," he said, "may I see this Reeve?"</p>

<p>"Come right along with me, son. I ain't pressing you for
what you know. But it may be a thing that'll help me to
hang Reeve. And if it is, I'll need to know it. Understand?
Public benefit&mdash;that's what I'm after. Come along with
me and you can see if Reeve's the man you're after."</p>

<p>They crossed the street through a little maelstrom
of fine dust which a wind circle had picked up, and the
sheriff led Bull into the jail. They crossed the tawdry
little outer room with its warped floor creaking under the
tread of Bull Hunter. Next they came face to face with a
cage of steel bars, and behind it was a little gray man on
a bunk. He sat up and peered at them from beneath bushy
brows, a thin-faced man, extremely agile. Even in sitting
up, one caught many possibilities of catlike speed of
action.</p>

<p>Bull knew at once that this was the man he sought. He
stood close to the bars, grasping one in each great hand,
and with his face pressed against the steel, he peered at
Pete Reeve. The other was very calm.</p>

<p>"Howdy, sheriff," he said. "Bringing on another one to
look over your bear?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER 7</h2>

<p class="first">THE prisoner's good humor impressed Bull
immensely. Here was a man talking commonplaces in the
face of death. A greater man than Uncle Bill, he felt at
once&mdash;a far greater man. It was impossible to conceive
of that keen, sharp eye and that clawlike hand sending a
bullet far from the center of the target.</p>

<p>He gave his eyes long sight of that face, and then
turned from the bars and went out with the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Is that your man?" asked the sheriff.</p>

<p>"I dunno," said Bull, fencing for time as they stood in
front of the jail. "What'd he do?"</p>

<p>"You mean why he's in jail? I'll tell you that, son, but
first I want to know what you got agin' him&mdash;and your
proofs&mdash;mostly your proofs!"</p>

<p>The distaste which Bull had felt for the sheriff from
the first now became overpowering. That he should be the
means of bringing that terrible and active little man to an
end seemed, as a matter of fact, absurd. Guile must have
played a part in that capture.</p>

<p>Suppose he were to tell the sheriff about the shooting
of Uncle Bill? That would be enough to convince men that
Pete Reeve was capable of murder, for the shooting of
Uncle Bill had been worse than murder. It spared the life
and ruined it at the same time. But suppose he added his
evidence and allowed the law to take its course with Pete
Reeve? Where would be his own reward for his long march
south and all the pain of travel and the crossing of the
mountains at the peril of his life? There would be nothing
but scorn from Uncle Bill when he returned, and not that
moment of praise for which he yearned. To gain that great
end he must kill Pete Reeve, but not by the aid of the
law.</p>

<p>"I dunno," he said to the sheriff who waited
impatiently. "I figure that what I know wouldn't be no good
to you."</p>

<p>The sheriff snorted. "You been letting me waste all this
time on you?" he asked Bull. "Why didn't you tell me that
in the first place?"</p>

<p>Bull scratched his head in perplexity. But as he raised
the great arm and put his hand behind his head, the sheriff
winced back a little. "I'm sorry," said Bull.</p>

<p>The sheriff dismissed him with a grunt of disgust, and
strode off.</p>

<p>Bull started out to find information. This idea was
growing slowly in his mind. He must kill Pete Reeve, and to
accomplish that great end he must first free him from the
jail. He went back to the hotel and went into the kitchen
to find food. The proprietor himself came back to serve
him. He was a pudgy little man with a dignified pointed
beard of which he was inordinately proud.</p>

<p>"It's between times for meals," he declared, "but you
being the biggest man that ever come into the hotel, I'll
make an exception." And he began to hunt through the
cupboard for cold meat.</p>

<p>"I seen Pete Reeve," began Bull bluntly. "How come he's
in jail?"</p>

<p>"Him?" asked the other. "Ain't you heard?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The little man sighed with pleasure; he had given up
hope of finding a new listener for that oft-told tale.
"It happened last night," he confided. "Along late in the
afternoon in rides Johnny Strange. He tells us he was
out to Dan Armstrong's place when, about noon, a little
gray-headed man that give the name of Pete Reeve came in
and asked for chow. Of course Johnny Strange pricks up his
ears when he hears the name. We all heard about Pete Reeve,
off and on, as about the slickest gunman that the ranges
ever turned out. So he looks Pete over and wonders at
finding such a little man."</p>

<p>The proprietor drew himself up to his full height. "He
didn't know that size don't make the man! Well, Armstrong
trotted out some chuck for Reeve, and after Pete had eaten,
Johnny Strange suggested a game. They sat in at three-
handed stud poker.</p>

<p>"Things went along pretty good for Johnny. He made a
considerable winning. Then it come late in the afternoon,
and he seen he'd have to be getting back home. He offered
to bet everything he'd won, or double or nothing, and when
the boys didn't want to do that, it give him a clean hand
to stand up and get out. He got up and said good-bye and
hung around a while to see how the next hands went. So far
as he could make out, Pete Reeve was losing pretty steady.
Then he come on in.</p>

<p>"Well, when Johnny Strange told about Pete being out
there, Sheriff Anderson was in the room and he rises up.</p>

<p>"'Don't look good to me,' he says. 'If a gunfighter is
losing money, most like he'll fight to win it back. Maybe
I'll go out and look that game over.'</p>

<p>"And saying that he slopes out of the room.</p>

<p>"Well, none of us took much stock in the sheriff going
out to take care of Armstrong. You see Armstrong was the
old sheriff, and he give Anderson a pretty stiff run for
his money last election. They both been spending most
of their time and energy the last few years hating each
other. When one of 'em is in office the other goes around
saying that the gent that has the plum is a crook; and then
Anderson goes out, and Armstrong comes in, and Anderson
says the same thing about Armstrong. Take 'em general and
they always had the boys worried when they was together,
for fear of a gunfight and bullets flying. And so, when
Anderson stands up and says he's going out to see that
Reeve don't do no harm to Armstrong, we all sat back and
kind of laughed.</p>

<p>"But we laughed at the wrong thing. Long about an hour
or so after dark we hear two men come walking up on the
veranda, and one of 'em we knowed by the sound was the
sheriff."</p>

<p>"How could you tell by the sound?" asked Bull
innocently.</p>

<p>"Well, you see the sheriff always wears steel rims on
his heels like he was a horse. He's kind of close with his
money is old Anderson, I'll tell a man! We hear the ring
of them heels on the porch, and pretty soon in comes the
sheriff, herding a gent in ahead of him. And who d'you
think that gent was? It was Reeve! Yes, sir, the old
sheriff had stepped out and grabbed his man. He wasn't
there quick enough to stop the killing of Armstrong, but
he got there fast enough to nab Reeve. Seems that when he
was riding up to the house he heard a shot fired, and then
he seen a man run out of the house and jump on his hoss,
and the sheriff didn't stop to ask no questions. He just
out with his gat and drills the gent's hoss. And while
Reeve was struggling on the ground, with the hoss flopping
around and dying, the sheriff runs up and sticks the irons
on Reeve. Then he goes into the house and finds Armstrong
lying shot through the heart. Clear as day! Reeve loses a
lot of money, and when it comes to a pinch he hates to see
that money gone when he could get it back for the price of
one slug. So he outs with his gun and shoots Armstrong.
And the worst part of it was that Armstrong didn't have
no gun on at the time. The sheriff found Armstrong's gun
hanging on the wall along with his cartridge belt. Yep, it
was plain murder, and Pete Reeve'll hang as high as the
sky&mdash;and a good thing, too!"</p>

<p>This story was a shock to Bull for a reason that would
not have affected most men. That a man who had had the
courage to stand up and face Uncle Bill in a fair duel
should have been so cowardly, so venomous as to take a
mean advantage of a gambling companion seemed to Bull
altogether too strange to be reasonable. Certainly, if he
had had a difference with this fellow, thought Bull, Pete
Reeve was the man to let the other use his own weapons
before he fought. But to shoot him down across a table,
unwarned&mdash;this was too much to believe! And yet it was
the truth, and Pete Reeve was to hang for it.</p>

<p>The big man sat shaking his head. "And they found the
money on Pete Reeve?" he asked gloomily. "They found the
money he took off this Armstrong?"</p>

<p>"There's the funny part of the yarn," said the
proprietor glibly. "Pete had the nerve to shoot the gent
down in cold blood, but when he seen him fall he lost his
nerve. He didn't wait to grab the money, but ran out and
jumped on his hoss and tried to get away. So there you
are. But it pretty often happens that way! Take the oldest
gunfighter in the world, and, if his stomach ain't resting
just right, it sort of upsets him to see a crimson stain. I
seen it happen that way with the worst of 'em, and in the
old days they used to be a rough crowd in my barroom. They
don't turn out that style of gent no more!" He sighed as
his mind flickered back into the heroic past.</p>

<p>"And Reeve&mdash;he admits he done the killing?" Bull
asked hopelessly.</p>

<p>"Him? Nope, he's too foxy for that. But the only story
he told was so foolish that we laughed at him, and he
ain't had the nerve to try to bluff us ever since. He
says that he was sitting peaceable with Armstrong when
all at once without no warning they was a shot from the
window&mdash;the east window, I remember he was particular
to say&mdash;and Armstrong dropped forward on the table,
shot through the heart.</p>

<p>"Reeve says that he didn't wait to ask no questions. He
blew the candle out, and having got the darkness on his
side, he made a jump through the door and got onto his
hoss. He says that he wanted to break away to the trees
and try to get a shot at the murderer from cover, but the
minute he got onto his hoss, he had his hoss shot from
under him."</p>

<p>"Was they any shots fired then?"</p>

<p>"Yep. Reeve says that he fired a couple of times when
he fell. But the sheriff says that Reeve only fired once,
as his hoss was falling, and that the other shot that was
found fired out of Reeve's gun was fired into the heart of
Armstrong. Oh, they ain't any doubt about it. All Reeve
has got is a cock-and- bull yarn that would make a fool
laugh!"</p>

<p>Although Bull had been many times assured by his uncle
and his cousins that he was a fool of the first magnitude,
he was in no mood for laughter. Somewhere in the tale there
was something wrong, for his mind refused to conjure up the
picture of Reeve pulling his gun and shooting across the
table into the breast of a helpless, unwarned man. That
would not be the method of a man who could stand up to
Uncle Bill. That would not be the method of the man who had
sat up on his bunk and looked so calmly into the face of
the sheriff.</p>

<p>Bull stood up and dragged his hat firmly over his eyes.
"I'd kind of like to see the place where that shooting was
done," he declared.</p>

<p>"You got lots of time before night," said the
proprietor. "Ain't more'n a mile and a half out the north
trail. Take that path right out there, and you can ride out
inside of five minutes."</p>

<p>There was no horse for Bull Hunter to ride. But, having
thanked his host, he stepped out into the cooler sunshine
of the late afternoon.</p>

<p>The trail led through scattering groves of cottonwood
most of the way, for it was bottom land, partially flooded
in the winter season of rain, and, even in the driest and
hottest part of the summer, marshy in places. He followed
the twisting little trail through spots of shadow and
stretches of open sky until he reached the shack which was
obviously that of the dead Armstrong.</p>

<p>The moment he entered the little cabin he received proof
positive.</p>

<p>The furniture had not apparently been disturbed since
the shooting. The table still leaned crazily, as though it
had not recovered from a violent shock on one side. One
chair was overturned. A box had been smashed to splinters,
probably by having someone put a foot through it.</p>

<p>Bull examined the deal table. Across the center of it
there was a dark stain, and on the farther side, two hands
were printed distinctly into the wood, in the same dull
color. The whole scene rose revoltingly distinct in the
mind of Bull.</p>

<p>Here sat Dan Armstrong playing his cheerful game,
laughing and jesting, because forsooth he was the winner.
And there, on the opposite side of the table, sat Pete
Reeve, the guest in the house of his host, growing darker
and darker as the money was transferred from his pocket
to the pocket of the jovial Armstrong. Then, a sudden
taking of offense at some harmless jest, the cold flash of
steel as Reeve leaned and jumped to his feet, and then the
explosion of the revolver, with Armstrong settling slowly,
limply forward on the table. There he lay with a stream
pouring across the table from the death wound, his helpless
arms outstretched on the wood.</p>

<p>Then Reeve, panic-stricken, perhaps with a sudden
stirring of remorse, started for the door, struck the box
on his way, smashing it to bits, and as soon as he got
outside, leaped for his horse. Luckily retribution had
overtaken the murderer in the very moment of escape. Bull
Hunter sighed. Never had the strength of the arm of the law
been so vividly brought home to him as by this incident.
Suppose that he had fulfilled his purpose and killed Reeve?
Would not the law have reached for him in the same fashion
and taken and crushed him?</p>

<p>He shuddered, and looking up from his broodings, he
glanced through the opposite window and saw that the woods
were growing dark in that direction. Night was approaching,
and, with the feeling of night, there was a ghostly sense
of death, as though the spirit of the dead man were
returning to his old home. On the other side of the house,
however, the woods showed brighter. This was the east
window&mdash;the east window through which Reeve declared
that the shot had been fired.</p>

<p>Bull shook his head. He stepped out of the cabin and
looked about. It was a prosperous little stretch of meadow,
cleared into the cottonwoods and reclaiming part of the
marshland&mdash;all very rich soil, as one could see at a
glance. There was a field which had been recently upturned
by the plow, perhaps the work of yesterday. The furrows
were still black, still not dried out by the sun. Today
would have been the time for harrowing, but that work was
indefinitely postponed by the grim visitor. No doubt this
Armstrong was an industrious man. The sense of a wasted
life was brought home to Bull; a bullet had ended it
all!</p>

<p>Absent-mindedly he passed around the side of the house
and started for the east window through which Reeve had
said that the bullet was fired, but he shook his head at
once.</p>

<p>On the east side the house leaned against a mass of
white stone. It rose high, rough, ragged. Certainly a man
stalking a house to fire a shot would never come up to it
from this side! His own words were convicting Reeve of the
murder!</p>

<p>Still he continued to clamber over the stones until he
stood by the window. To be sure, if a man stood there,
he could easily have fired into the room and into the
breast of a man sitting on the far side of the table.
Armstrong was found there. Bull looked down to his feet
as a thoughtful man will do, and there, very clearly
marked against the white of the stone, he saw a dark
streak&mdash;two of them, side by side.</p>

<p>He bent and looked at them. Then he rubbed the places
with his fingertips and examined the skin. A stain had come
away from the rock. It was as if the rocks had been rubbed
with lead or a soft iron. And then, strangely, into the
mind of Bull came the memory of what the hotel man had said
of the sheriff's iron-shod heels.</p>

<p>The sheriff had gone for many a year hating Armstrong.
The truth rushed over the brain of the big man. What a
chance for a crafty mind! To kill his enemy and place the
blame on the shoulders of one already known to be a man-
killer! Bull Hunter leaped from the rocks and started back
for the town with long, ground-devouring strides.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>

<p class="first">THERE were two reasons for the happiness
which lightened the step of Bull Hunter as he strode
back for the town. In the first place he saw a hope of
liberating Reeve from jail and accomplishing his own
mission of killing the man. In the second place he felt a
peculiar joy at the thought of freeing such a man from the
imputation of a cowardly murder.</p>

<p>Yet he had small grounds for his hopes. Two little dark
marks on the white, friable stone, marks that the first
small shower of rain would wash away, marks that the first
keen sandstorm would rub off&mdash;this was his only proof.
And with this to free one man from danger of the rope and
place the head of another under the noose&mdash;it was a
task to try the resources of a cleverer man than Bull.</p>

<p>Indeed, the high spirits of Bull in some measure left
him as he drew nearer and nearer to the village. How could
he convict the sheriff? How, with his clumsy wits and his
clumsy tongue, could he bring the truth to light? Had he
possessed the keen eyes of his uncle he felt that a single
glance would have made the guilt stand up in the face of
Anderson. But his own eyes, alas, were dull and clouded.</p>

<p>Thoughtfully, with bowed head, he held his course. A
strange picture, surely, this man who so devoutly wished
to free another from the danger of the law in order that
he might take a life into his own hands. But the contrast
did not strike home to Bull. To him everything that he did
was as clear as day. But how to go to work? If the man were
like himself it would be an easy matter. More than once
he remembered how his cousins had shifted the blame for
their own boyish pranks upon him. In the presence of their
father they would accuse Bull with a well-planned lie, and
the very fact that he had been accused made Bull blush and
hang his head. Before he could be heard in his own behalf
the cruel eye of his uncle had grown stern, and Bull was
condemned as a culprit.</p>

<p>"The only time you show any sense," his uncle had said
more than once, "is when you want to do something you
hadn't ought to do!"</p>

<p>Steadily through the years he had served as a scapegoat
for his cousins. They set a certain value upon him for
his use in this respect. Ah, if only he had that keen,
embarrassing eye of Bill Campbell with which to pierce
to the guilty heart of the sheriff and make him speak!
The eye of his uncle was like the eye of a crowd. It was
an audience in itself and condemned or praised with the
strength of numbers.</p>

<p>It was this thought of numbers that brought the clue
to a possible solution to Bull Hunter. When it came to
him he stopped short in the road, threw back his head and
laughed.</p>

<p>"And what's all the celebration about?" asked a voice
behind him.</p>

<p>He turned and found Sheriff Anderson on his horse
directly behind him. The soft loam of the trail had covered
the sound of the sheriffs approach. Bull blushed with
a sudden sense of shame. Moreover, the sheriff seemed
unapproachably stern and dignified. He sat erect in the
saddle, a cavalier figure with his long, well-drilled
mustaches.</p>

<p>"I dunno," said Bull vaguely, pushing his hat back to
scratch his thatch of blond hair. "I didn't know I was
celebrating, particular."</p>

<p>The sheriff watched him with small, evil eyes. "You been
snooping around, son," he said coldly. "And we folks in
this part, we don't like snoopers. Understand?"</p>

<p>"No," said Bull frankly, "I don't exactly figure what
you mean." Then he dropped his hand to his hip.</p>

<p>"Git your hand off that gun!" said the sheriff, his own
weapon flashing instantly in the light.</p>

<p>It had been a move like lightning. Its speed stunned and
baffled Bull Hunter. Something cold formed in his throat,
choking him, and he obediently drew his hand away. He did
more. He threw both immense arms above his head and stood
gaping at the sheriff.</p>

<p>The latter eyed him for a moment with stern amusement,
and then he shoved the gun back into its holster. "I guess
they ain't much harm in you," he said more to himself than
to Bull. "But I hate a snooper worse than I do a rat. You
can take them arms down."</p>

<p>Bull lowered them cautiously.</p>

<p>"You hear me talk?" asked the sheriff.</p>

<p>"I hear," said Bull obediently.</p>

<p>"I don't like snoopers. Which means that I don't like
you none too well. Besides, who in thunder are you? A
wanderin' vagrant you look to me, and we got a law agin'
vagrants. You amble along on your trail pretty pronto,
and no harm'll come to you. But if you're around town
tomorrow&mdash;well, you've heard me talk!"</p>

<p>It was very familiar talk to Bull; not the words, but
the commanding and contemptuous tone in which they were
spoken. Crestfallen, he submitted. Of one thing he must
make sure: that no harm befell him before he faced Pete
Reeve and Pete Reeve's gun. Then he could only pray for
courage to attack. But the effect of the sheriff's little
gunplay entirely disheartened Bull at the prospect of
facing Pete.</p>

<p>With a noncommittal rejoinder he started down the road,
and the sheriff put the spurs to his horse and plunged by
at a full gallop, flinging the dust back into the face of
the big man. Bull wiped it out of his eyes and went on
gloomily. He had been trodden upon in spirit once more.
But, after all, that was so old a story that it made little
difference. It convinced him, however, of one thing; he
could never do anything with the sheriff man to man.
Certainly he would need the help of a crowd before he faced
the tall man and his cavalier mustaches.</p>

<p>He waited until after the supper at the hotel. It was
a miserable meal for Bull; he had already eaten, and he
could not find a way of refusing the invitation of the
proprietor to sit down again. Seated at the end of the long
table he looked miserably up and down it. Nobody had a look
for him except one of contempt. The sheriff, it seemed,
had spread a story around about his lack of spirit, and
if Bull remained long in the village, he would be treated
with little more respect than he had been in the house of
his uncle. Even now they held him in contempt. They could
not understand, for instance, why he sat so far forward.
He was resting most of his weight on his legs, for fear of
the weakness of the chair under his full bulk. But that
very bulk made them whisper their jokes and insults to one
another.</p>

<p>When the long nightmare of that meal was ended, Bull
began making his rounds. He had chosen his men. Every man
he picked was sharp-eyed like Uncle Bill Campbell. They
were the men whose inlooking eyes would baffle the sheriff;
they were the men capable of suspicions, and such men Bull
needed&mdash;not dull-glancing people like himself.</p>

<p>He went first to the proprietor of the hotel. "I got
something to say to the sheriff," he declared. "And I want
to have a few important gents around town to be there to
listen and hear what I got to say. I wonder, could you be
handy?"</p>

<p>He was surprised at the avidity with which his
invitation was accepted. It was a long time since the hotel
owner had been referred to as an "important man."</p>

<p>Then he went with the same talk to five others&mdash;the
blacksmith, the carpenter and odd-jobber, the storekeeper,
and two men whom he had marked when he first halted near
the hotel veranda. To his invitation each of them gave a
quick assent. There had been something mysterious in the
manner in which this timid-eyed giant had descended upon
the town from nowhere, and now they felt that they were
about to come to the heart of the reason of his visit.</p>

<p>The invitation to the sheriff was delivered by the
proprietor of the hotel, and he said just enough&mdash;and
no more&mdash;to bring the sheriff straight to the hotel.
Anderson arrived with his best pair of guns in his
holsters, for the sheriff was a two-gun man of the best
variety. He came with the aggressive manner of one ready
to beat down all opposition, but when he stepped into
the room, his manner changed. For he found sitting about
the table in the dining room, which was to be the scene
of the conference, the six most influential men of the
town&mdash;men strong enough to reelect him next year, or
to throw him permanently out of office.</p>

<p>At the lower end of the table stood Bull Hunter, his
arms folded, his face blank. Standing with the light from
the lamp shining upon his face, the others seated, he
seemed a man among pygmies.</p>

<p>"Shall I lock the door?" asked the proprietor, and
he turned to Bull, as if the latter had the right to
dictate.</p>

<p>Bull nodded.</p>

<p>"All right, sheriff," the proprietor went on to explain.
"Our young friend yonder says that he's got something to
say to you. He's asked each of us to hang around and be a
witness. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Jud," burst out the sheriff, "you're an idiot! This
overgrown booby needs a horsewhipping, and that's the sort
of an answer I'd like to make to him."</p>

<p>Having delivered this broadside he strode up and
confronted Bull. It was a very poor move. In the first
place, the sheriff had insulted one of the men who was
about to act as his official judge. In the second place, by
putting himself so close to Bull, he made himself appear a
trifle ludicrous. Also, if he expected to throw Bull out
of the poise with this blustering, he failed. It was not
that Bull did not feel fear, but he had seen a curious
thing&mdash; the sinewy, long neck of the sheriff&mdash;and
he was wondering what would happen if one of his hands
should grip that throat for a single instant. He grew so
fascinated by this study that he forgot his fear of the
sheriff's guns.</p>

<p>Anderson hastened to retreat from his false position.
"Gents," he said, "excuse me for getting edgy. But, if you
want me to listen to this fellow's talk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hunter is his name&mdash;Bull Hunter," said the
proprietor.</p>

<p>The sheriff took his place at the far end of the long
table. Like Bull, he preferred to stand. "Start in your
talk," he commanded.</p>

<p>"It looks to me," said Bull gently, "that they's only
one gent here that's wearing a gun." He had thrown his own
belt on a chair; and now he fixed his eyes on the weapons
of Anderson.</p>

<p>The sheriff glared. "You want me to take off my guns?
Son, I'd rather go naked!"</p>

<p>Jud, the hotel man, had already been insulted once by
the sheriff, and he had been biding his time. This seemed
an excellent opening. "Looks to me," he remarked, "like Mr.
Hunter was right. He's got something pretty serious to say,
and he don't want to take no chances on your cutting him
short with a bullet!"</p>

<p>The sheriff glared at Bull and then cast a swift glance
over the faces of the others. He read upon them only one
expression&mdash;a cold curiosity. Plainly they agreed
with Jud, and the sheriff gave way. He took off his belt
and tossed it upon a chair near him. Then he faced Bull
again, but he faced the big man with half his confidence
destroyed. As he had said, he felt worse than naked without
his revolvers under his touch, but now he attempted to
brave out the situation.</p>

<p>"Well," he said jocularly, "what you going to accuse me
of, Bull Hunter?"</p>

<p>"I'm just going to tell a little story that I been
thinking about," said Bull.</p>

<p>"Story&mdash;nothing!" exclaimed Anderson.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," broke in Jud. "Let him tell this his
own way&mdash;I think you'd best, sheriff!"</p>

<p>Bull was looking at the sheriff and through him into
the distance. After all, it was a story, as distinctly a
story as if he had it in a book. As he began to tell it, he
forgot Sheriff Anderson at the farther end of the table.
He talked slowly, bringing the words out one by one, as if
what he said were coming to him by inspiration&mdash;a kind
of second sight.</p>

<p>"It starts in," said Bull, "the other night when the
gent come in with word that Pete Reeve was out playing
cards with Armstrong and losing money. When the sheriff
heard that, he started to thinking. He was remembering
how he'd hated Armstrong for a good many years, and that
made him think that maybe Armstrong would get into trouble
with Reeve, because Reeve is a pretty good shot, and the
sheriff hoped that, if it come to a showdown, Reeve would
shoot Armstrong full of holes. And that started him wishing
pretty strong that Armstrong would get killed!"</p>

<p>"Do I have to stand here and listen to this fool talk?"
demanded the sheriff.</p>

<p>"I'm just supposing," said Bull. "Surely they ain't any
harm in just supposing?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," decided Jud, who had taken the position of
main arbiter.</p>

<p>"Well, the sheriff got to wishing Armstrong was dead
so strong that it didn't seem he could stand to have him
living much more. He told the folks that he was going out
to see that no harm come to Armstrong from Reeve. Then he
got on his hoss and went out. All the way he was thinking
hard. Armstrong was the gent that was sheriff before
Anderson; Armstrong was the gent that might get the job and
throw him out again. Ain't that clear? Well, the sheriff
gets close to the cabin and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused and slowly extended his long arm toward the
sheriff. "What'd you do then?"</p>

<p>"Me? I heard a shot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You left your hoss standing in the brush near the
house," interrupted Bull, "and you went along on foot."</p>

<p>"Does that sound reasonable, a gent going on foot when
he might ride?" demanded the sheriff.</p>

<p>"You didn't want to make no noise," said Bull, and his
great voice swallowed the protest of the sheriff.</p>

<p>Anderson cast another glance at the listeners. Plainly
they were fascinated by this tale, and they were following
it step by step with nods.</p>

<p>"You didn't make no noise, either," went on Bull Hunter.
"You slipped up to the cabin real soft, and you climbed up
on the east side of the house over some rocks."</p>

<p>"Why in reason should a man climb over rocks? Why
wouldn't he go right to the door?"</p>

<p>"Because you didn't want to be seen."</p>

<p>"Then why not the west window, fool!"</p>

<p>"You tried that window first, but they was some dry
brush lying in front of it, and you couldn't come close
enough to look in without making a noise stepping on the
dead wood. So then you went around to the other side and
climbed over the rocks until you could look into the cabin.
Am I right?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;no, curse you, no! Of course you ain't right!"
shouted Anderson.</p>

<p>"Looking right through that window," said Bull heavily,
"you seen Armstrong, the man you hated, facing you, and,
with his back turned, was Pete Reeve. You said to yourself,
'Drop Armstrong with a bullet, catch Reeve, and put the
blame on him!' Then you pulled your gun."</p>

<p>He pushed aside the ponderous armchair which stood
beside him at the head of the table.</p>

<p>"Say," shouted the sheriff, paler than ever now, "what
are you accusing me of?"</p>

<p>"Murder!" thundered Bull Hunter.</p>

<p>The roar of Bull's voice chained every one in his place,
the sheriff with staring eyes, and Jud in the act of
raising his hand.</p>

<p>"I'll jail you for slander!" said the sheriff, fighting
to assurance and knowing that he was betrayed by his
pallor and by the icy perspiration which he felt on his
forehead.</p>

<p>"Anderson," said Bull, "I seen the marks of them iron
heels of yours on the rock!"</p>

<p>That was a little thing, of course. As evidence it would
not have convinced the most prejudiced jury in the world,
but Sheriff Anderson was not weighing small points. Into
his mind leaped one image&mdash;the whiteness of those
rocks on which he had stood and the indelible mark his
heels must have made against that whiteness. He was lost,
he felt, and he acted on the impulse to fight for his
life.</p>

<p>One last glance he cast at the six listeners, and in
their wide-eyed interest he read his own damnation. Then
Anderson whirled and leaped for his belt with the guns.</p>

<p>Out of six throats came six yells of fear; there was a
noise of chairs being pushed back and a wild scramble to
find safety under the table. Jud, risking a moment's delay,
knocked the chimney off the lamp before he dived. The flame
leaped once and went out, but the pale moonshine poured
through the window and filled the room with a weird play of
shadows.</p>

<p>What Bull Hunter saw was not the escape of the sheriff,
but a sudden blind rage against everything and everybody.
It was a passion that set him trembling through all of his
great body. One touch of trust, one word of encouragement
had been enough to make him a giant to tear up the stump in
the presence of Jessie and his cousins; how far more mighty
he was in the grip of this new emotion, this rage.</p>

<p>His own gun was far away, but guns were not what he
wanted. They were uncongenial toys to his great hands.
Instead, he reached down and caught up that massive chair
of oak, built to resist time, built to bear even such a
bulk as that of Bull Hunter with ease. Yet he caught it
up in one hand, weighed it behind his head at the full
limit of his extended arm, and then, bending forward, he
catapulted the great missile down the length of the table.
It hit the lamp on the way and splintered it to small bits,
its momentum unimpeded. Hurtling on across the table it
shot at the sheriff as he whirled with his guns in his
hands.</p>

<p>Fast as the chair shot forward, the hand of the sheriff
was faster still. Bull saw the big guns twitch up, silver
in the moonshine. They exploded in one voice, as if the
flying mass of wood were an animate object. Then the
sheriff was struck and hurled crashing along the floor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER 9</h2>

<p class="first">AT that fall the six men scampered from
beneath the table to seize the downed man. There was no
need of their haste. Sheriff Anderson was a wreck rather
than a fighting man. One arm was horribly crumpled beneath
him; his ribs were shattered, there was a great gash
where the rung of the chair had cut into the bone like a
knife.</p>

<p>They stood chattering about the fallen man,
straightening him out, feeling his pulse, making sure
that he, who would soon hang at the will of the law, was
alive. Outside, voices were rushing toward them, doors
slamming.</p>

<p>Bull Hunter broke through the circle, bent over the limp
body, and drew a big bundle of keys from a pocket. Then,
without a word, he went back to the far end of the room,
buckled on his gun belt, and in silence left the room.</p>

<p>The others paid no heed. They and the newcomers who had
poured into the room were fascinated by the work of the
giant rather than the giant's self. They had a lantern,
swinging dull light and grotesque shadows across the place
now, and by the illumination, two of the men went to the
wall and picked up the great oaken chair. They raised it
slowly between them, a battered mass of disconnected wood.
Then they looked to the far end of the long table where he
who had thrown the missile had stood. Another line had been
written into the history of Bull Hunter&mdash;the first
line that was written in red.</p>

<p>Bull himself was on his way to the jail. He found it
unguarded. The deputy had gone to find the cause of the
commotion at the hotel. The steel bars, moreover, were
sufficient to retain the prisoner and keep out would-be
rescuers.</p>

<p>In the dim light of his lantern, Bull saw that Pete
Reeve was sitting cross-legged on his bunk, like a little,
dried-up idol, smoking a cigarette. His only greeting to
the big man was a lifting of the eyebrows. But, when the
big key was fitted into the lock and the lock turned, he
showed his first signs of interest. He was standing up when
Bull opened the door and strode in.</p>

<p>"Have you got your things?" said Bull curtly.</p>

<p>"What things, big fellow?"</p>

<p>"Why, guns and things&mdash;and your hat, of course."</p>

<p>Pete Reeve walked to the corner of the cell and took a
sombrero off the wall. "Here's that hat," he answered, "but
they ain't passing out guns to jailbirds&mdash;not in these
parts!"</p>

<p>"You ain't a jailbird," answered Bull, "so we'll get
that gun. Know where it is?"</p>

<p>Reeve followed without a question through the open door,
only stopping as he passed beyond the bars, to look back to
them with a shudder. It was the first sign of emotion he
had shown since his arrest. But his step was lighter and
quicker as he followed Bull into the front room.</p>

<p>"In that closet, yonder," said Reeve, pointing to a
door. "That's where they keep the guns."</p>

<p>Bull shook out his bundle of keys into the great palm of
his hand.</p>

<p>"Not those keys&mdash;the deputy has the key to the
closet," said Pete. "I saw Anderson give it to him."</p>

<p>Bull sighed. "I ain't got much time, partner," he said.
Approaching the door, he examined it wistfully. "But,
maybe, they's another way." He drew back a little, raised
his right leg, and smashed the heavy cowhide boot against
the door. The wood split from top to bottom, and Bull's
leg was driven on through the aperture. He paused to
wrench the fragments of the door from lock and hinges and
then beckoned to Pete Reeve. "Look for your gun in here,
Reeve."</p>

<p>The little man cast one twinkling glance at his
companion and then was instantly among the litter of the
closet floor. He emerged strapping a belt about him, the
holster tugging far down, so that the muzzle of the gun was
almost at his knee. Bull appreciated the diminutive size of
the man for the first time, seeing him in conjunction with
the big gun on his thigh.</p>

<p>There was an odd change in the little man also, the
moment his gun was in place. He tugged his broad-brimmed
hat a little lower across his eyes and poised himself, as
if on tiptoe; his glance was a constant flicker about the
room until it came to rest on Bull. "Suppose you lemme
in on the meaning of all this. Who are you and where do
you figure on letting me loose? What in thunder is it all
about?"</p>

<p>"We'll talk later. Now you got to get started."</p>

<p>Bull waved to the door. Pete Reeve darted past him with
noiseless steps and paused a moment at the threshold of the
jail. Plainly he was ready for fight or flight, and his
right hand was toying constantly with the holstered butt of
his gun. Bull followed to the outside.</p>

<p>"Hosses?" asked the little man curtly.</p>

<p>"On foot," answered Bull with equal brevity, and he led
the way straight across the street. There was no danger of
being seen. All the life of the town was drawn to a center
about the hotel. Lights were flashing behind its windows,
men were constantly pounding across the veranda, running in
and out. Bull led the way past the building and cut for the
cottonwoods.</p>

<p>"And now?" demanded Pete Reeve. "Now, partner?"</p>

<p>That word stung Bull. It had not been applied to him
more than a half a dozen times in his life, together with
its implications of free and equal brotherhood. To be
called partner by the great man who had conquered terrible
Uncle Bill Campbell!</p>

<p>"They's a mess in the hotel," said Bull, explaining
as shortly as he could. "Seems that Sheriff Anderson was
the gent that done the killing of Armstrong. It got found
out and the sheriff tried to get away. Lots of noise and
trouble."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Reeve, "it was him, then&mdash;the old hound!
I might have knowed! But I kep' on figuring that they was
two of 'em! Well, the sheriff was a handy boy with his
gun. Did he drop anybody before they got him? I heard two
guns go off like one. Them must of been the sheriff's
cannons."</p>

<p>"They was," said Bull, "but them bullets didn't hit
nothing but wood."</p>

<p>"Wild, eh? Shot into the wall?"</p>

<p>"Nope. Into a chair."</p>

<p>The little man was struggling and panting sometimes
breaking into a trot to keep up with the immense strides of
his companion. "A chair? You don't say so!"</p>

<p>Bull was silent.</p>

<p>"How come he shot at a chair? Drunk?"</p>

<p>"The chair was sailing through the air at him."</p>

<p>"H'm!" returned Pete Reeve. "Somebody throwed a chair at
him, and the sheriff got rattled and shot at it instead of
dodging? Well, I've seen a pile of funnier things than that
happen in gun play, off and on. Who threw the chair?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"You?" He squinted up at the lofty form of Bull Hunter.
"What name did you say?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>"Hunter is my name. Mostly they call me Bull."</p>

<p>"You got the size for that name, partner. So you cleaned
up the sheriff with a chair?" he sighed. "I wish I'd been
there to see it. But who got the inside on the sheriff?"</p>

<p>"I dunno what you mean?"</p>

<p>Pete Reeve looked closely at his companion. Plainly he
was bewildered, somewhere between a smile and a frown.</p>

<p>"I mean who found out that the sheriff done it?"</p>

<p>"He told it himself," said Bull.</p>

<p>"Drunk, en?"</p>

<p>"Nope. Not drunk. He was asked if he didn't do the
murder."</p>

<p>"Great guns! Who asked him?"</p>

<p>"I done it," said Bull as simply as ever.</p>

<p>Reeve bit his lip. He had just put Bull down as a
simple-minded hulk. He was forced to revise his opinion.</p>

<p>"You done that? You follered him up, eh?"</p>

<p>"I just done a little thinking. So I asked him."</p>

<p>Reeve shook his head. "Maybe you hypnotized him," he
suggested.</p>

<p>"Nope. I just asked him. I got a lot of folks sitting
around, and then I began telling the sheriff how he done
the shooting."</p>

<p>"And he admitted it?"</p>

<p>"Nope. He jumped for a gun."</p>

<p>"And then you heaved a chair at him." Pete Reeve drew in
a long breath. "But what reason did you have, son? I got
to ask you that before I thank you the way I want to thank
you. But, before you kick out, you'll find that Pete Reeve
is a friend."</p>

<p>"My reason was," said Bull, "that I had business to do
with you that couldn't be done in a jail. So I had to get
you out."</p>

<p>"And now where're we headed?"</p>

<p>"Where we can do that business."</p>

<p>They had reached a broad break in the cottonwoods; the
moonlight was falling so softly and brightly.</p>

<p>Bull paused and looked around him. "I guess this'll have
to do," he declared.</p>

<p>"All right, son. You can be as mysterious as you want.
Now what you got me here for?"</p>

<p>"To kill you," said Bull gently.</p>

<p>Pete Reeve flinched back. Then he tapped his holster,
made sure of the gun, became more easy. "That's
interesting," he announced. "You couldn't wait for the law
to hang me, eh?"</p>

<p>Bull began explaining laboriously. He pushed back his
hat and began to count off his points into the palm of one
hand. "You shot up Uncle Bill Campbell," he explained. "It
ain't that I got any grudge agin' you for that, but you
see, Uncle Bill took me in young and give me a home all
these years. I thought it would sort of pay him back if I
run you down. So I walked across the mountains and come
after you."</p>

<p>"Wait!" exclaimed Pete Reeve. "You walked?"</p>

<p>"Yep," he went on, heedless of the fact that Pete Reeve
was peering earnestly into the face of his companion, now
puckered with the earnest frown of thought. "I come down
hoping to get you and kill you. Besides, that wouldn't only
pay back Uncle Bill. It would make him think that I was a
man. You see, Reeve, I ain't quick thinking, and I ain't
bright. I ain't got a quick tongue and sharp eyes, and they
been treating me like I was a kid all my life. So I got to
do something. I got to! I ain't got anything agin' you, but
you just happen to be the one that I got to fight. Stand
over yonder by that stump. I'll stand here, and we'll fight
fair and square."</p>

<p>Pete Reeve obeyed, his movements slow, as if they were
the result of hypnotism. "Bull," he said rather faintly,
looking at the towering bulk of his opponent, "I dunno.
Maybe I'm going nutty. But I figure that you come down here
to kill me for the sake of getting your uncle to pat you on
the back once or twice. And you find you can't get at me
because I'm in jail, so you work out a murder mystery to
get me out, and then you tackle me. You say you ain't very
bright. I dunno. Maybe you ain't bright, but you're mighty
different!"</p>

<p>He paused and rubbed his forehead. "Son, I've seen
pretty good men in my day, but I ain't never seen one that
I cotton to like I do to you. You've saved my life. How can
you figure on me going out and taking yours, now?"</p>

<p>"You ain't going to, maybe," said Bull calmly. "Maybe
I'll get to you."</p>

<p>"Son," answered the other almost sadly, shaking his
head, "when I'm right, with a good, steady nerve, they
ain't any man in the world that can sling a gun with me.
And tonight I'm right. If it comes to a showdown&mdash; but
are you pretty good with a gun yourself, Bull?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Bull frankly. "I ain't any good compared
to an expert like you. But I'm good enough to take a
chance."</p>

<p>"Them sort of chances ain't taken twice, Bull!"</p>

<p>"You see," said Bull, "I'm going to make a rush as
I pull the gun, and if I get to you before I'm dead,
well&mdash;all I ask is to lay my hands on you, you
see?"</p>

<p>The little man shuddered and blinked. "I see," he said,
and swallowed with difficulty. "But, in the name of reason,
Bull, have sense! Lemme talk! I'll tell you what that uncle
of yours was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk!" exclaimed Bull Hunter. "I sort of like
you, partner, and it sort of breaks me down to hear you
talk. Don't talk, but listen. The next time that frog
croaks we go for our guns, eh? That frog off in the
marsh!"</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken before the ominous sound was heard,
and Bull reached for his gun. For all his bulk of hand
and unwieldy arms, the gun came smoothly, swiftly into
his hand. He would have had an ordinary man covered, long
before the latter had his gun muzzle-clear of the leather.
But Pete Reeve was no ordinary man. His arm jerked down;
his fingers flickered down and up. They went down empty;
they came up with the burden of a long revolver, shining in
the moonlight, and he fired before Bull's gun came to the
level for a shot.</p>

<p>Only Pete Reeve knew the marvel of his own shooting
this day. He had sworn a solemn and silent oath that he
would not kill this faithful, courageous fellow from the
mountains. He could have planted a bullet where the life
lay, at any instant of the fight. But he fired for another
purpose. The moment Bull reached for his weapon he had
lurched forward, aiming to shoot as he ran. Pete Reeve set
himself a double goal. His first intention was to disarm
the giant; the other was to stop his rush. For, once within
the grip of those big fingers, his life would be squeezed
out like the juice of an orange.</p>

<p>His task was doubly difficult in the moonlight. But
the first shot went home nicely, aimed as exactly as a
scientist finds a spot with his instruments. Where the
moon's rays splashed across the bare right forearm of Bull,
he sent a bullet that slashed through the great muscles.
The revolver dropped from the nerveless hand of the giant,
but Bull never paused. On he came, empty-handed, but with
power of death, as the little man well knew, in the fingers
of his extended left hand. He came with a snarl, a savage
intake of breath, as he felt the hot slash of Pete's
bullet. But Reeve, standing erect like some duelist of old,
his left hand tucked into the hollow of his back, took the
great gambling chance and refused to shoot to kill.</p>

<p>He placed his second shot more effectively, for this
time he must stop that tremendous body, advancing upon
him. He found one critical spot. Between the knee and the
thigh, halfway up on the inside of the left leg, he drove
that second bullet with the precision of a surgeon. The leg
crumpled under Bull and sent him pitching forward on his
face.</p>

<p>Perhaps the marsh ground was unstable, but it seemed to
Pete Reeve that the very earth quaked beneath his feet as
the big man fell. He swung his gun wide and leaned to see
how serious was the damage he had done. Bleeding would be
the greater danger.</p>

<p>But that fraction of a second brought him into another
peril. The giant heaved up on his sound right leg and
his sound left arm, and flung himself forward, two limbs
dangling uselessly. With a hideously contorted face, Bull
swung his left arm in a wide circle for a grip and scooped
in Pete Reeve, as the latter sprang back with a cry of
horror.</p>

<p>The action swept Pete in and crushed his gun hand and
arm against the body of his assailant, paralyzing his only
power of attack or defense. Reeve was carried down to the
ground as if beneath the bulk of a mountain. There was no
question of sparing life now. Pete Reeve began to fight
for life. He wrestled at his gun to tug it free, but found
it anchored. He pulled the trigger, and the gun spoke loud
and clear, but the bullet plunged into empty space. Then he
felt that left arm begin to move, and the hand worked up
behind his back like a great spider.</p>

<p>Higher it rose, and the huge, thick fingers reached up
and around his throat, fumbling to get at the windpipe.
Pete Reeve made his last effort; it was like striving to
free himself from a ton's weight. Hysteria of fear and
horror seized him, and his voice gave utterance to his
terror. As he screamed, the big fingers joined around his
throat. Any further pressure would end him!</p>

<p>He looked up into the glaring eyes and the contorted
face of the giant; the rasping, panting breathing paralyzed
his senses. There was a slight inward contraction of the
grip; then it ceased.</p>

<p>Miraculously he felt the great hand relax and fall away.
The bulk was heaved away from him, and staggering to his
own feet, he saw Bull Hunter supported against a tree, one
leg useless, one arm streaming.</p>

<p>"I couldn't seem to do it," said Bull Hunter thickly. "I
couldn't noways seem to do it, Reeve. You see, I sort of
like you, and I couldn't kill you, Pete."</p>

<p>When Pete Reeve recovered from his astonishment he said,
"You can do more. You can go home and tell that infernal
hound of an uncle of yours that you had the life of Pete
Reeve under your fingertips and that you didn't take it.
It's the second time I've owed my life, and both times in
one day, and both times to one man. You tell your uncle
that!"</p>

<p>The big man sagged still more against the tree. "I'll
never go home, Pete, unless ghosts walk; and I'll never
tell Uncle Bill anything, unless the ghosts talk. I'm dying
pretty pronto, I think, Pete."</p>

<p>"Dyin'? You ain't hurt bad, Bull!"</p>

<p>"It's the bleeding; all the senses is running out of my
head&mdash;like water&mdash;and the moon&mdash;is turning
black&mdash;and&mdash;" He slumped down at the foot of the
tree.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN old Farmer Morton and his son came
in their buckboard through the marshes, they heard the
screaming of Pete Reeve for help. Leaving their team, they
bolted across country to the open glade. There they found
Pete still shouting for help, kneeling above the body of
a man, and working desperately to arrange an effectual
tourniquet. They ran close and discovered the two men.</p>

<p>Old Morton knew enough rude surgery to stop the
bleeding. It was he who counted the pulse and listened to
the heart. "Low," he said, "very low&mdash; life is just
flickerin', stranger."</p>

<p>"If they's as much light of life in him," said Pete
Reeve, "as the flicker of a candle, I'll fan it up till
it's as big as a forest fire. Man, he's got to live."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Morton. "And how come the shooting?"</p>

<p>"Stop your fool questions," said Reeve. "Help me get him
to town and to a bed."</p>

<p>It was useless to attempt to carry that great,
loose-limbed body. They brought the buckboard perilously
through the shrubbery and then managed, with infinite
labor, to lift Bull Hunter into it. With Pete Reeve
supporting the head of the wounded man and cautioning them
to drive gently, they managed the journey to the town as
softly as possible. At the hotel a strong-armed cortege
bore Bull to a bed, and they carried him reverently. Had
his senses been with him he would have wondered greatly;
and had his uncle, or his uncle's sons, been there, they
would surely have laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>In the hotel room Pete Reeve took command at once. "He's
too big to die," he told the dubious doctor. "He's got
to live. And the minute you say he can't, out you go and
another doc comes in. Now do your work."</p>

<p>The doctor, haunted by the deep, fiery eyes of the
gunfighter, stepped into the room to minister to his
patient. He had a vague feeling that, if Bull Hunter died,
Pete Reeve would blame him for lack of care. In truth, Pete
seemed ready to blame everyone. He threatened to destroy
the whole village if a dog was allowed to howl in the
night, or if the baby next door were permitted to cry in
the day.</p>

<p>Silence settled over the little town&mdash;silence
and the fear of Pete Reeve. Pete himself never left the
sickroom. Wide-eyed, silent-footed, he was ever about. He
seemed never to sleep, and the doctor swore that the only
reason Bull Hunter did not die was because death feared to
enter the room while the awful Reeve was there.</p>

<p>But the long hours of unconsciousness and delirium wore
away. Then came the critical period when a relapse was
feared. Finally the time came when it could be confidently
stated that Bull was recovering his health and his
strength.</p>

<p>All this filled a matter of weeks. Bull was still unable
to leave his bed. He was dull and listless, bony of hand,
and liable to sleep many hours through the very heart of
the day. At this point of his recovery the door opened one
day, and, in the warmth of the afternoon, a big man came
into the room, shutting the door softly behind him.</p>

<p>Bull turned his head slowly and then blinked, for it
was the unshaven face of his cousin, Harry Campbell, that
he saw. With his eyes closed, Bull wondered why that face
was so distinctly unpleasant. When he opened them again,
Harry had drawn closer, his hat pushed on the back of his
head after the manner of a baffled man, and a faint smile
working at the corners of his lips. He took the limp hand
of Bull in his and squeezed it cautiously. Then he laid
the hand back on the sheet and grinned more confidently at
Bull.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be hanged, Bull, here you are as big as
life, pretty near, and you don't act like you knew me!"</p>

<p>"Sure I do. Sit down, Harry. What brung you all this
ways?"</p>

<p>"Why, anxious to see how you was doing."</p>

<p>Again Bull blinked. Such anxiety from Harry was a
mystery.</p>

<p>"They ain't talking about much else up our way," said
Harry, "but how you come across the mountains in the storm,
and how big you are, and how you got the sheriff, and how
you rushed Pete Reeve bare-handed. Sure is some story! All
the way down I just had to say that I was Bull Hunter's
cousin to get free meals!" He licked his lips and grinned
again. "So I come down to see how you was."</p>

<p>"I'm doing tolerable fair," said Bull slowly, "and
it was good of you to come this long ways to ask that
question. How's things to home?"</p>

<p>"Dad's bunged up for life; can't do nothing but cuss,
but at that he lays over anything you ever hear." Harry's
eyes flicked nervously about the room. "It was him that
sent me down! Where's Reeve?"</p>

<p>This was in a whisper. Bull gestured toward the next
room.</p>

<p>"Asleep? Can he hear if I talk?"</p>

<p>"Asleep," said Bull. "Been up with me two days. I took a
bad turn a while back. Pete's helping himself to a nap, and
he needs one!"</p>

<p>"Now, listen!" said Harry. "Dad figured this out, and
Dad's mostly never wrong. He says, 'Reeve shot up Bull.
Now he's hanging around trying to make up by nursing Bull,
according to reports, because he's afraid of what Bull'll
do when he gets back on his feet. But Bull has got to
know that, even when he's back on his feet, he can't beat
Reeve&mdash;not while Reeve can pull a gun. Nobody can beat
that devil. If he wants to beat Reeve, just take advantage
of him while Reeve ain't expecting anything&mdash;which
means while Bull is sick.' Do you get what Dad means?"</p>

<p>"Sort of," said Bull faintly. He shut out the eager,
dirty, unshaven face. "I'll just close my eyes against the
light. I can hear you pretty well. Go on."</p>

<p>"Here's the idea. Everybody knows you hate Reeve, and
Reeve fears you. Otherwise would he act like this, aside
from being afraid of a lynching, in case you should die?
No, he wouldn't. Well, one of these days you take this
gun"&mdash;here Harry shoved one under the pillow of
Bull&mdash;"and call Pete Reeve over to you, and when he
leans over your bed, blow his brains out! That's easy, and
it'll do what you'll want to do someday. You hear? Then you
can say that Reeve started something&mdash;that you shot in
self-defense. Everybody'll believe you, and you'll get one
big name for killing Reeve! You foller me?"</p>

<p>Bull opened his eyes, but they were squinting as though
he was in the severest pain. "Listen, Harry," he said at
last. "I been thinking things out. I owe a lot to your dad
for taking me in and keeping me. But all I owe him I can
pay back in cash&mdash;someday. I don't owe him no love.
Not you, neither."</p>

<p>Harry had risen to his feet with a snarl.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Bull, letting his great voice swell
ever so little. "I'm pretty near dead, but I'm still man
enough to wring the neck of a skunk! Sit down!"</p>

<p>Harry obeyed limply, and his giant cousin went on, his
voice softening again. "When you come in I closed my eyes,"
said Bull, "because it seemed to me like you was a dream.
I'd been awake. I'd been living among men that sort of
liked me and respected me and didn't laugh at me. And then
you come, and I saw your dirty face, and it made me think
of a bad nightmare I'd had when you and your brother and
your dad treated me worse'n a dog. Well, Harry, I'm through
with that dream. I'll never go back to it. I'm going to
stay awake the rest of my life. It was your dad that put
the wish to kill Reeve into my head with his talk. I met
Reeve, and Reeve pumped some bullets with sense into me. He
let out some of my life, but he let in a lot of knowledge.
Among other things he showed me what a friend might be.
He's stayed here and nursed me and talked to me &mdash;like
I was his equal, almost, instead of being sort of simple,
like I really am. And I've made up my mind that I'm going
to cut loose from remembering you folks in the mountains.
I ain't your kind. I don't want to be your kind. I want
to fight, like Pete Reeve. I don't want to murder like
a Campbell! All the way through, I want to be like Pete
Reeve. He don't know it. Maybe when I'm well he'll go off
by himself. But whether he's near or far, I've adopted
him. I'm going to pattern after him, and the happiest day
of my life will be when I earn the right to have this man,
that I tried to kill, come and take my hand and call me
'friend'! I guess that answers you, Harry. Now get out and
take my talk back to your dad, and don't trouble me no
more&mdash;you spoil my sleep!"</p>

<p>As he spoke the door of the next room opened softly.
Peter Reeve stood at the entrance. Harry, shaking with
fear, backed toward the other door, then leaped far out,
and whirled out of sight with a slam and clatter of feet on
the stairs. Pete Reeve came slowly to the bedside.</p>

<p>"I was awake, son," he said, "and I couldn't help
hearing."</p>

<p>Bull flushed heavily.</p>

<p>"It's the best thing I ever heard," said Pete. "The best
thing that's ever come to my ears&mdash;partner!"</p>

<p>With that word their hands joined. In reality, far more
than he dreamed, Bull had been born again.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER 11</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN they were together, they made a study
in contrasts. By seeing one it was possible to imagine the
other. For instance, seeing the high, narrow forehead,
peaked face, the gray-flecked hair of Pete Reeve, his
nervous step, his piercing and uneasy eyes&mdash;seeing
this man with his body from which all spare flesh was
wasted so that he remained only muscle and nerve, it was
easy to conjure up the figure of Bull Hunter by thinking of
opposites.</p>

<p>Their very voices held a world of difference. The
tone of Pete Reeve was pitched a little high, hard, and
somewhat nasal, and when he was angry his words came shrill
and ringing. The mere sound of his voice was irritating
&mdash;it put one on edge with expectancy of action.
Whereas the full, deep, slow, musical voice of Bull Hunter
was a veritable sleep producer. Men might fear Charlie
Bull Hunter because of his tremendous bulk; but children,
hearing his voice, were unafraid.</p>

<p>The motions of Pete Reeve were as fast and as deft as
the whiplash striking of a snake. The motions of Bull
Hunter were premeditated and cautious, as befitting one
whose hands might crush what they touched, and whose
footfall made a flooring groan.</p>

<p>He sat cross-legged on the floor, his back against the
wall. They had moved a ponderous stool into the room so
that Bull might have something on which to sit, but long
habit had made him uneasy in a chair, and he kept to the
floor by preference, with the great square chin resting on
his fist and his knee supporting his elbow. That position
pressed the forearm against the biceps and the big muscles
bulged out on either side, vast as the thigh of a strong
man.</p>

<p>With lionlike wrinkles of attention between his eyes, he
listened to the exposition of the little man, and followed
his movements with patient submission&mdash;like a pupil to
whom a great master has consented to unfold the secrets of
his brushwork; in such a manner did Bull Hunter drink in
the words and the acts of Pete Reeve. And, indeed, where
guns were the subject of conversation it would have been
hard to find a man more thoroughly equipped to pose as an
expert than Pete Reeve. That fleshless hand, all speed of
motion as it whipped out the gun from the nerve and sinew,
became an incredible ghost with the holster and the long,
heavy Colt danced and flashed at his fingertips as though
it were a gilded shadow.</p>

<p>As he worked he talked, and as he talked he strode
constantly back and forth through the room with his
light-falling, mincing steps. He grew excited. He flushed.
There came a thrill and a ring and a deepening of the
voice. For the master was indeed talking of the secrets of
his craft.</p>

<p>A thousand men of the mountains and the cattle ranges,
men who, for personal pride or for physical need, studied
accuracy and speed in gunplay, would have paid untold
prices to learn these secrets from the lips of the
little man. To Bull Hunter the mysteries were revealed
for nothing, freely, and drilled and drummed into him
through the weeks of his convalescence; and still the
lessons continued now that he was hale and hearty once
more&mdash;as the clean-swept platters from which he ate
three times a day gave evidence.</p>

<p>"I've practiced, you admit," said Bull in his slow
voice, as Pete Reeve came to a pause. "But I haven't got
your way with a gun, Pete. You've got a genius for it. I
don't blame you for laughing at me when I try to get out my
gun fast. I can shoot straight. That's because I haven't
any nerves, as you say, but I'll never be able to get out
a gun as fast as a thought&mdash;the way you do. Fact is,
Pete, I don't think fast, you know."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" exploded Pete Reeve, who had been inwardly
chafing with impatience during the whole length of this
speech. "Sometimes you talk like a fool, Bull, and this is
one time!"</p>

<p>Bull shook his head. "My arms are too big," he said
sadly. "The muscle gets in my way. I can feel it bind when
I try to jerk out the gun fast. Better give up the job,
Pete. I sure appreciate all the pains you've taken with me
&mdash;but I'll never be a gunfighter."</p>

<p>Pete Reeve shook his head with a sigh and then dropped
into a chair, growing suddenly inert.</p>

<p>"No use," he groaned. "All because you ain't got any
confidence, Bull." He leaned forward in his sudden way.
"Know something? I been keeping it back, but now I'll tell
you the straight of it. You're faster with a gun right now
than four men out of five!"</p>

<p>Bull gaped in amazement.</p>

<p>"Fact!" cried Reeve. "You get it out slicker than most;
and after it's out, you shoot as straight as any man I've
ever seen. Trouble is, you don't appreciate yourself.
You've had it drilled into you so long that you're stupid
that now you believe it. All nonsense! You got more than a
million have and you're fast right now on the draw. Once
get hold of how important it is, and you'll keep trying.
But you think it's only a game. You just play at it; you
don't work! I wish you could have seen me when I was first
practicing with a gun! I lived with it. Hours every day it
was my companion, and right up to now, there ain't a day
goes by that I don't spend some time keeping on edge with
my revolver. Bull, you'll have to do the same thing. You
hear?"</p>

<p>He sprang up again. It was impossible for him to remain
seated a long time.</p>

<p>"You think it don't mean much. Look here!"</p>

<p>The Colt flicked into his hand and lay trembling in his
palm, and as he talked, it shifted smoothly, as if of its
own volition, forward toward his fingertips, backward, to
the side, dropping out until it seemed about to fall, only
to be caught with one finger through the trigger-guard and
spun up again. Always the heavy weapon was in motion as
though some of the nervous spirit of Reeve had entered the
heavy metal. It responded to his thoughts rather than to
his muscles. Bull Hunter gazed enchanted. He was accustomed
to forgetting himself and admiring others.</p>

<p>"Look here!" went on the little man. "Look at me. I
weigh about a hundred and twenty. I'm skinny. I'm a runt.
And look at you. You weigh&mdash;heaven knows what! No
fat, but all muscle from your head to your feet. You're
the strongest man that I've ever seen. Take me, I'm not
a coward; but you, Bull, you don't know what fear means.
Well, there you are, without fear, and stronger than three
strong men. You're pretty fast with a gun, and you shoot
straight as a hawk looks. And still, if we stood face to
face and went for our guns, I'd live; and you with your
muscle would be dead, Bull."</p>

<p>"I know," Bull nodded.</p>

<p>"That's what this gun means," cried Pete. "This gun, and
the fact that I can get it out of the leather faster'n you
do. Not very much faster. But by just as much quicker as it
takes for an eyelid to wink. That ain't much time, but it's
enough time to mean life or death! That's all! I'm not the
only man that's faster'n you are. They's others. I've never
been beat to the draw, but they's some that's shot so close
to me that it sounded like one gun going off &mdash;with a
sort of a stammer. And any one of those men would of shot
you dead, Bull, if you'd fought 'em. Now, knowing that,
tell me, are you going to keep practicing?"</p>

<p>"I'll keep tryin', Pete. But I'll never get much faster.
You see, my arm &mdash;it's too big, too heavy. It gets in
my way, handling a little thing like a revolver!"</p>

<p>Pete spun the big Colt and shoved it back into the
holster so incredibly fast that the steel hissed against
the leather.</p>

<p>"There you go running yourself down," he muttered.</p>

<p>He began to pace the room again, biting his nether lip,
and now and then shooting side glances at Bull, glances
partly guilty and partly scornful. Presently he came to a
halt. He had also come to a new resolution, one that cost
him so much that beads of perspiration came out on his
forehead.</p>

<p>"Bull," he said gravely, "I'm going to tell you the
secret."</p>

<p>"You've told me a dozen already," Bull sighed. "You've
taught me how to swing the muzzle up, and not too far up,
and how to lean back instead of forward, and how to harden
the arm muscles just as I pull the trigger, and how to
squeeze with the whole hand and keep my wrist stiff, and
how&mdash;"</p>

<p>"None of them things counts," said Pete gravely, almost
sadly, "compared to what I'm going to tell you. Stand
up!"</p>

<p>It was plain that he was going to give something from
the depths of his mind. The cost and importance of it made
his eyes like steel and drew his mouth to a thin, straight
line.</p>

<p>Bull Hunter arose; and as the great body unfolded and
the legs straightened, it seemed that he would never reach
his full height. At length he stood, enormous, wide,
towering. He was not a freak, but simply a perfectly
proportioned man increased to a huge scale.</p>

<p>Pete Reeve canted his head back and looked into the
face of the giant. There was a momentary affectionate
appreciation in his eye. Then he hardened his
expression.</p>

<p>"Let your arm hang loose."</p>

<p>Bull Hunter obeyed. The hand came just above the holster
that was strapped on his thigh. All these weeks Pete Reeve
had kept him from going an instant without that gun except
when he slept. And even when he slept the gun had to be
under his pillow.</p>

<p>"Because it helps to have it near all the time," Pete
had explained. "It sort of soaks into your dreams. It's
never out of your mind. It haunts you, like the face of the
girl you love. You see!"</p>

<p>Bull Hunter did not see, but he had nodded humbly, after
his fashion, and obeyed. Now, with his arm fallen loose at
his side he peered studiously into the face of his master
gunman and waited for the next order.</p>

<p>"Draw!"</p>

<p>The command was snapped out; Bull's gun whipped from
the holster; and Pete Reeve drew in the same instant,
carelessly, his eyes watching the movement of Bull instead
of paying heed and put his gun up again, but Bull followed
the example almost reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Nearly beat you that time, Pete," he exclaimed happily.
"But maybe you weren't half trying?"</p>

<p>"Beat me?" sneered Pete. "I wasn't half trying, but you
didn't beat me. I shot you twice before you had your muzzle
in line. I shot you in the throat and through the teeth
before your gun was ready."</p>

<p>Bull, with a shrug of the massive shoulders, touched the
mentioned places and looked with awe at the little man.</p>

<p>"Now, listen!"</p>

<p>Bull grew tense.</p>

<p>"Watch my draw!"</p>

<p>Pete did not put his hand near the butt of his weapon.
He held his arm out before him, dangling in the air. There
was a convulsive moment. One could see the imaginary weapon
shoot from the holster and become level and rigid, pointed
at its mark.</p>

<p>"I've seen before&mdash;fast as my eye could go," Bull
sighed.</p>

<p>"Look again," said Pete, gritting his teeth with
impatience. "This time I'm going so slow a cow could see
and beat me."</p>

<p>He made the same motion, but to an ordinary eye it was
still as fast as light. Bull shook his head.</p>

<p>"Idiot!" cried Pete, his voice jumping up the scale,
flat and harsh and piercing. "It's the wrist! Not the arm,
but the&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped with an expression of dismay. Even now he
regretted revealing the mystery, it seemed. But then he
went on.</p>

<p>"I found out quick that I couldn't beat a good gunman
if I used the old methods. Practice makes perfect; they
practiced as much as I did. So I studied the methods and
the great idea come to me. They all use the whole arm. Look
at you! Your shoulder bulges up when you make the draw, and
you raise the whole arm. Matter of fact, you'd ought only
to use your fingers. Not stir a muscle above the wrist. Now
try!"</p>

<p>Bull tried&mdash;the gun did come clear of the
holster.</p>

<p>"No good," he said gravely. "It's magic when you do it,
Pete. It just makes a fool of me."</p>

<p>"Shut up and listen!" Pete said sharply. "I'm telling
you a thing that'll save your life some day!"</p>

<p>He drew a little closer. His emotion made him swell
to a greater stature, and he rose a little on tiptoe as
if partly to make up for the differences between their
bulks.</p>

<p>Bull obeyed.</p>

<p>"Now start thinking. Start concentrating on that right
hand. There's nothing else to your body. You see? You
forget you got a muscle. There's three things in the world.
You see? Just three things and no more. There's your gun
with a bullet in it; there's your hand that's going to get
the gun out; and there's your target&mdash;that doorknob,
say! Keep on thinking. They ain't any more to your body.
You're just a hand and an eye. All your nerves are down
there in that hand. They're all piled down there. That hand
is full of electricity. Don't let your eyes wander. Keep
on concentrating. You're stocking the electricity in that
hand. When your hand moves, it'll be as fast as the jump of
a spark! And when that hand moves, the gun is going to come
out clean in it. It's <i>got</i> to come out with it! You hear?
It's <i>got</i> to! Your fingertips catch under the butt; they
flick up. They don't draw the gun; they throw it out of the
holster; they pitch the muzzle up, and the butt comes smack
back against the palm of your hand. And in the same part of
a second you pull the trigger. You hear?"</p>

<p>He leaned forward, trembling from head to foot. The eyes
of the big man were beginning to narrow.</p>

<p>"I hear; I understand!" he said through his teeth.</p>

<p>"You don't pull the gun. You <i>think</i> it out of the
leather. And then the bullet hits the doorknob. You don't
move your arm. Your arm doesn't exist. You're just a hand
and a brain&mdash;thinking! And that thought sends a bullet
at the mark!" He leaped back. "Draw!"</p>

<p>There was a wink of light at the hip of Bull Hunter, and
the gun roared.</p>

<p>Instantly he cried out, alarmed, confused, ashamed.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to shoot, Pete. I'm a fool! I didn't mean
to! It&mdash;I sort of couldn't help it. The&mdash;the
trigger was just pulled without my wanting it to! Lord,
what'll people think!"</p>

<p>But Pete Reeve had flung his arms around the big man
as far as they would go, and he hugged him in a hysteria
of joy. Then he leaped back, dancing, throwing up his
hands.</p>

<p>"You done it!" he cried, his voice squeaking,
hysterical.</p>

<p>"I made a fool of myself, all right," said Bull,
bewildered by this exhibition of joy where he had expected
anger.</p>

<p>"Fool nothing! Look at that knob!"</p>

<p>The doorknob was a smashed wreck, driven into the
thick wood of the door by the heavy slug of the revolver.
Footsteps were running up the stairs of the hotel. Pete
Reeve ran to the door and flung it open.</p>

<p>"It's all right, boys," he called. "Cleaning a gun and
it went off. No harm done!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER 12</h2>

<p class="first">"AND now," said Pete Reeve, looking almost
ruefully at his pupil, "with a little practice on that,
they ain't a man in the world that could safely take a
chance with you. I couldn't myself."</p>

<p>"Pete!"</p>

<p>"I mean it, son. Not a man in the world. I was afraid
all the time. I was afraid you didn't have that there
electricity in you or whatever they call it. I was
afraid you had too much beef and not enough nerves.
But you haven't. And now that you have the knack, keep
practicing every day&mdash;thinking the gun out of the
leather&mdash;that's the trick!"</p>

<p>Bull Hunter looked down to the gun with great, staring
eyes, as though it was the first time in his life that he
had seen the weapon. Pete Reeve noted his expression and
abruptly became silent, grinning happily, for there was the
dawn of a great discovery in the eyes of the big man.</p>

<p>The gun was no longer a gun. It was a part of him. It
was flesh of his flesh. He had literally thought it out of
the holster, and the report of the weapon had startled him
more than it had frightened anyone else in the building.
He looked in amazement down to the broad expanse of his
right hand. It was trembling a little, as though, in fact,
that hand were filled with electric currents. He closed
his fingers about the butt of the gun. At once the hand
became steady as a rock. He toyed with the weapon in
loosely opened fingers again, and it slid deftly. It seemed
impossible for it to fall into an awkward position.</p>

<p>The voice of Pete Reeve came from a great distance. "And
they's only one thing lacking to make you perfect&mdash;and
that's to have to fight once for your life and drop the
other gent. After that happens&mdash;well, Pete Reeve will
have a successor!"</p>

<p>How much that meant Bull Hunter very well knew. The
terrible fame of Pete Reeve ran the length and the breadth
of the mountains. Of course Bull did not for a moment dream
that Pete meant what he said. It was all figurative. It was
said to fill him with self-confidence, but part of it was
true. He was no longer the clumsy-handed Bull Hunter of the
moment before.</p>

<p>A great change had taken place. From that moment his
very ways of thinking would be different. He would be
capable of less misty movements of the mind. He would be
capable of using his brain as fast as his hand acted. A
tingle of new life, new possibilities were opening before
him. He had always accepted himself as a stupidly hopeless
burden in the world, a burden on his friends, useless,
cloddish. Now he found that he had hopes. His own mind
and body was an undiscovered country which he was just
beginning to enter. What might be therein was worth a
dream or two, and Bull Hunter straightway began to dream,
happily. That was a talent which he had always possessed in
superabundance.</p>

<p>The brief remainder of the day passed quickly; and then
just before supper time a stranger came to call on Pete
Reeve. He was a tall, bony fellow with straight-looking
eyes and an imperious lift of his head when he addressed
anyone. Manners was his name&mdash;Hugh Manners. When he
was introduced he ran his eyes unabashedly over the great
bulk of Bull Hunter, and then promptly he turned his back
on the big man and excluded him from the heart of the
conversation. It irritated Bull unwontedly. He discovered
that he had changed a great deal from the old days at
his uncle's shack when he was used to the scorn and the
indifference of all men as a worthless and stupid hulk of
flesh, with no mind worth considering, but he said nothing.
Another great talent of Bull's was his ability to keep
silent.</p>

<p>Shortly after this they went down to the supper table.
All through the meal Hugh Manners engaged Pete Reeve in
soft, rapid-voiced conversation which was so nicely gauged
as to range that Bull Hunter heard no more than murmurs.
He seemed to have a great many important things to say to
Pete, and he kept Pete nodding and listening with a frown
of serious interest. At first Pete tried to make up for
the insolent neglect of his companion by drawing a word or
two from Bull from time to time, but it was easy for Bull
to see that Pete wished to hear his newfound friend hold
forth. It hurt Bull, but he resigned himself and drew out
of the talk.</p>

<p>After supper he went up to the room and found a book.
There had been little time for reading since he passed the
first stages of convalescence from his wounds. Pete Reeve
had kept him constantly occupied with gun work, and the
hunger for print had been accumulating in Bull. He started
to satisfy it now beside the smoking lamp. He hardly heard
Pete and Hugh Manners enter the room and go out again onto
the second story of the veranda on which their room opened.
From time to time the murmur of their voices came to him,
but he regarded it not.</p>

<p>It was only when he had lowered the book to muse over a
strange sentence that his wandering eye was caught beyond
the window by the flash of a falling star of unusual
brilliance. It was so bright, indeed, that he crossed the
room to look out at the sky, stepping very softly, for he
had grown accustomed to lightening his footfall, and now
unconsciously the murmuring voices of the talkers made him
move stealthily&mdash;not to steal upon them, but to keep
from breaking in on their talk. But when he came to the
door opening on the veranda the words he heard banished all
thought of falling stars. He listened, dazed.</p>

<p>Pete Reeve had just broken into the steady flow of the
newcomer's talk.</p>

<p>"It's no use, Hugh. I can't go, you see. I'm tied down
here with the big fellow."</p>

<p>"Tied down?" thought Bull Hunter, and he winced.</p>

<p>A curse, then, "Why don't you throw the big hulk
over?"</p>

<p>"He ain't a hulk," protested Pete somewhat sharply, and
the heart of Bull warmed again.</p>

<p>"Hush," said Hugh Manners. "He'll be hearing."</p>

<p>"No danger. He's at his books, and that means that he
wouldn't hear a cannon. That's his way."</p>

<p>"He don't look like a book-learned gent," said Hugh
Manners with more respect in his voice.</p>

<p>"He don't look like a lot of things that he is," said
Pete. "I don't know what he is myself&mdash;except that
he's the straightest, gentlest, kindest, simplest fellow
that ever walked."</p>

<p>Bull Hunter turned to escape from hearing this eulogy,
but he dared not move for fear his retreat might be
heard&mdash;and that would be immensely embarrassing.</p>

<p>"Just what he is I don't know," said Pete again. "He
doesn't know himself. He's had what you might call an
extra-long childhood&mdash;that's why he's got that misty
look in his eyes."</p>

<p>"That fool look," scoffed Hugh Manners.</p>

<p>"You think so? I tell you, Manners, he's just waking up,
and when he's clear waked up he'll be a world-beater! You
saw that doorknob?"</p>

<p>"Smashed? Yep. What of it?"</p>

<p>"He done it with a gun, standing clean across the room,
with a flash draw, shooting from the hip&mdash;and he made
a clean center hit of it."</p>

<p>Pete brought out these facts jerkily, one by one, piling
one extraordinary thing upon the other; and when he had
finished, Hugh Manners gasped.</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad," he said, "that you told me that,
I&mdash;I might of made some mistake."</p>

<p>"You'd sure've made an awful mistake if you tangle with
him, Manners. Don't forget it."</p>

<p>"Your work, I guess."</p>

<p>"Partly," said Pete modestly. "I speeded his draw up
a bit, but he had the straight eye and the steady hand
when I started with him. He didn't need much target
practice&mdash;just the draw."</p>

<p>"And he's really fast?"</p>

<p>"He's got my draw."</p>

<p>That told volumes to Manners.</p>

<p>"And why not take him in with us?" he asked, after a
reverent pause.</p>

<p>"Not that!" exclaimed Pete. "Besides, he couldn't ride
and keep up with us. He'd wear out three hosses a day with
his weight."</p>

<p>"Maybe we could find an extra-strong hoss. He ain't so
big as to kill a good strong hoss, Pete. I've seen a hoss
that carried&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No good," said Pete with decision. "I wouldn't even
talk to him about our business. He don't guess it. He
thinks that I'm&mdash;well, he don't have any idea about
how I make a living, that's all!"</p>

<p>"But how <i>will</i> you make a living if you stick with
him?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," Pete sighed. "But I'm not going to turn him
down."</p>

<p>"But ain't you about used up your money?"</p>

<p>"It's pretty low."</p>

<p>"And you're supporting him?"</p>

<p>"Sure. He ain't got a cent."</p>

<p>Bull started. He had not thought of that matter at all,
but it stood to reason that Pete had expended a large sum
on him.</p>

<p>"Sponging?" said Manners cynically.</p>

<p>"Don't talk about it that way," said Pete uneasily.
"He's like a big kid. He don't think about those things. If
I was broke, he'd give me his last cent."</p>

<p>"That's what you think."</p>

<p>"Shut up, Manners. Bull is like&mdash;a cross between a
son and a brother."</p>

<p>"Pretty big of bone for your son, Pete. You'll have a
hard time supporting him," and Manners chuckled. Then, more
seriously, "You're making a fool of yourself, pardner.
Throw this big hulk over and come back&mdash;with me!
They's loads of money staked out waiting for us!"</p>

<p>"Listen," said Pete solemnly. "I'm going to tell you
why I'll never turn Bull Hunter down if I live to be a
hundred! When I was a kid a dirty trick was done me by
old Bill Campbell. I waited all these years till a little
while ago to get back at him. Then I found him and fought
him. I didn't kill him, but I ruined him and sent him back
to his home tied on his hoss with a busted shoulder that
he'll never be able to use again. His right shoulder, at
that."</p>

<p>There was a subdued exclamation from Manners, but Pete
went on, "Seems he was the uncle of this Bull; took Bull in
when Bull was orphaned, because he had to, not because he
wanted to, and he raised Bull up to be a sort of general
slave around the place. Well, when he comes back home all
shot up he tries to get his sons to take my trail, but they
didn't have the nerve. But Bull that they'd always looked
down on for a big good-for-nothing hulk&mdash;Bull stepped
out and took my trail on foot and hit across the mountains
in a storm, above the timberline!</p>

<p>"And he followed till he come up with me here where he
found me in jail, accused of a murder. Did he turn back?
He didn't. He didn't want the law to hang me. He wanted to
kill me with his own hands so's he could go back home and
hear his uncle call him a man and praise him a little. That
shows how simple he is.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll cut a long story short. Bull scouted around,
found out that the sheriff had done the killing himself
and just saddled the blame on me, and then he makes the
sheriff confess, gets me out of jail, and takes me out in
the woods.</p>

<p>"'Now,' says he, 'you've got a gun, and I've got a gun,
and I'm going to kill you if I can.'</p>

<p>"No use arguing. He goes for his gun. I didn't want to
kill a man who'd saved my life. I tried to stop him with
bullets. I shot him through the right arm and made him drop
his gun. Then he charged me barehanded!"</p>

<p>There was a gasp from Manners.</p>

<p>"Barehanded," repeated Pete. "That's the stuff that's
in him! I shot him through the left leg. He pitched onto
his face, and then hanged if he didn't get up on one arm
and one leg and throw himself at me. He got that big arm of
his around me. I couldn't do a thing. My gun was squeezed
between him and me. He started fumbling. Pretty soon he
found my throat with them big gorilla fingers of his. I
thought my last minute had come. One squeeze would have
smashed my windpipe&mdash;and good-bye, Pete Reeve!</p>

<p>"But he wouldn't kill me. After I'd filled him full of
lead, he let me go. After he had the advantage he wouldn't
take it." Pete choked. He concluded briefly, "He mighty
near bled to death before I could get the wounds bandaged,
and then I stayed on here and nursed him. Matter of fact,
Manners, he saved my life twice and that's why I'm tied to
him for life. Besides, between you and me, he means more to
me than the rest of the world put together."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Manners, after a pause. "I see what
you mean and I'll tell you what you got to do. That big
boy will do anything you tell him. He follers you with
his eyes. Well, we'll find a hoss that will carry him. I
guarantee that. Then you put your game up to him, best foot
forward, and he'll come with us."</p>

<p>"Not in a thousand years," said Pete with emotion. "That
boy will never go crooked if I can keep him straight. Do
you know what he's done? Because his uncle and cousins
tried to get me, he's sworn never to see one of 'em again.
He's given them up&mdash;his own flesh and blood&mdash;to
follow me, and I'm going to stick to him. That's complete
and final."</p>

<p>"No, Pete, of all the fools&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bull waited to hear no more. He stole back to the table
on the far side of the room sick at heart and sat down to
think or try to think.</p>

<p>The truth came to him slowly. Pete Reeve, whom he had
taken as his ideal, was, as a matter of fact&mdash;he dared
not think what! The blow shook him to the center. But
he had been living on the charity of Reeve. He had been
draining the resources of the generous fellow. And how
would he ever be able to pay him back?</p>

<p>One thing was definite. He must put an end to any
increase of the obligations. He must leave.</p>

<p>The moment the thought came to him he tore a flyleaf out
of the book and wrote in his big, sprawling hand:</p>

<p>Dear Pete:</p>

<p>I have to tell you that it has just occurred to me that
you have been paying all the bills, and I've been paying
none. That has to stop, and the only way for me to stop it
is to go off all by myself. I hate to sneak away, but if
I stay to say good-bye I know you'll argue me out of it
because I'm no good at an argument. Good-bye and good luck,
and remember that I'm not forgetting anything that has
happened; that when I have enough money to pay you back I'm
coming to find you if I have to travel all the way around
the world.</p>

<p>Your pardner,</p>

<p>BULL</p>

<p>That done, he paused a moment, tempted to tear up the
little slip. But the original impulse prevailed. He put the
paper on the table, picked up his hat, and stole slowly
from the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER 13</h2>

<p class="first">HE went out the back door of the hotel so
that few people might mark his leaving, and cut for the
woods. Once in them, he changed his direction to the east,
heading for the lower, rolling hills in that direction. He
turned back when the lights of the town had drawn into one
small, glimmering ray. Then this, too, went out, and with
it the pain of leaving Pete Reeve became acute. He felt
lost and alone, that keen mind had guided him so long. As
he stalked along with the great swinging strides through
the darkness, the holster rubbed on his thigh and he
remembered Pete. Truly he had come into the hands of Pete
Reeve a child, and he was leaving him as a man.</p>

<p>The dawn found him forty miles away and still swinging
strongly down the winding road. It was better country
now. The desert sand had disappeared, and here the soil
supported a good growth of grass that would fatten the
cattle. It was a cheerful country in more ways than the
greenness of the grass, however. There were no high
mountains, but a continual smooth rolling of hills, so that
the landscape varied with every half-mile he traveled. And
every now and then he had to jump a runlet of water that
murmured across his trail.</p>

<p>A pleasant country, a clear sky, and a cool wind
touching at his face. The contentment of Bull Hunter
increased with every step he took. He had diminished the
sharpness of his hunger by taking up a few links of his
belt, but he was glad when he saw smoke twisting over a
hill and came, on the other side, in view of a crossroads
village. He fingered the few pieces of silver in his
pocket. That would be enough for breakfast, at least.</p>

<p>It was enough; barely that and no more, for the long
walk had made him ravenous, and the keenness of his spirits
served to put a razor edge on an appetite which was already
sharp. He began eating before the regular breakfast at the
little hotel was ready. He ate while the other men were
present. He was still eating when they left.</p>

<p>"How much?" he said when he was done.</p>

<p>His host scratched his head.</p>

<p>"I figure three times a regular meal ought to be about
it," he said. "Even then it don't cover everything; but
matter of fact, I'm ashamed to charge any more."</p>

<p>His ruefulness changed to a grin when he had the money
in his hand, and Bull Hunter rose from the table.</p>

<p>"But you got something to feed, son," he said. "You
certainly got something to feed. And&mdash;is what the boys
are saying right?"</p>

<p>It came to Bull that while he sat at the table there
had been many curious glances directed toward him, and a
humming whisper had passed around the table more than once.
But he was accustomed to these side glances and murmurs,
and he had paid no attention. Besides, food had been before
him.</p>

<p>"I don't know. What do they say?"</p>

<p>"That you're Dunbar from the South&mdash;Hal Dunbar."</p>

<p>"That's not my name," said Bull. "My name is Hunter."</p>

<p>"I guess they were wrong," said the other. "Trouble is,
every time anybody sees a big man they say, 'There goes Hal
Dunbar.' But you're too big even to be Dunbar I reckon."</p>

<p>He surveyed the bulk of Bull Hunter with admiring
respect. This personal survey embarrassed the big man.
He would have withdrawn, but his host followed with his
conversation.</p>

<p>"We know Dunbar is coming up this way, though. He sent
the word on up that he's going to come to ride Diablo. I
guess you've heard about Diablo?"</p>

<p>Bull averred that he had not, and his eyes went
restlessly down the road. It wove in long curves,
delightfully white with the bordering of green on either
side. He could see it almost tossing among the far-off
hills. Now was the time of all times for walking, and if
Pete Reeve started to trail him this morning, he would
need to put as much distance behind him by night as his
long legs could cover. But still the hotel proprietor hung
beside him. He wanted to make the big man talk. It was
possible that there might be in him a story as big as his
body.</p>

<p>"So you ain't heard of Diablo? Devil is the right name
for him. Black as night and meaner'n a mountain lion.
That's Diablo. He's big enough and strong enough to carry
even you. Account of him being so strong, that's why Dunbar
wants him."</p>

<p>"Big enough and strong enough to carry me?" repeated
Bull Hunter.</p>

<p>He had had unfortunate experiences trying to ride
horses. His weight crushed down their quarters and made
them walk with braced legs. To be sure, that was up in
the high mountains where the horses were little more than
ponies.</p>

<p>"Yep. Big enough. He's kind of a freak hoss, you see.
Runs to almost seventeen hands, I've heard tell, though I
ain't seen him. He's over to the Bridewell place yonder in
the hills&mdash;along about fifteen miles by the road, I
figure. He run till he was three without ever being taken
up, and he got wild as a mustang. They never was good on
managing on the Bridewell place, you see? And then when
they tried to break him he started doing some breaking on
his own account. They say he can jump about halfway to the
sky and come down stiff-legged in a way that snaps your
neck near off. I seen young Huniker along about a month
after he tried to ride Diablo. Huniker was a pretty good
rider, by all accounts, but he was sure a sick gent around
hosses after Diablo got through with him. Scared of a
ten-year-old mare, Huniker was, after Diablo finished with
him. Scott Porter tried him, too. That was a fight! Lasted
close onto an hour, they say, nip and tuck all the way.
Diablo wasn't bucking all the time. No, he ain't that way.
He waits in between spells till he's thought up something
new to do. And he's always thinking, they say. But if he
wasn't so mean he'd be a wonderful hoss. Got a stride as
long as from here to that shed, they say."</p>

<p>He rambled on with a growing enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"And think of a hoss like that being given away!"</p>

<p>"Given away?" said Bull with a sudden interest.</p>

<p>And then he remembered that horses were outside of his
education entirely.</p>

<p>He listened with gloomy attention while his host went
on. "Yes, sir. Given away is what I said and given away is
what I mean. Old Chick Bridewell has kept him long enough,
he says. He's tired of paying buckaroos for getting busted
up trying to ride that hoss. Man-eater, that's what he
calls Diablo, and he wants to give the hoss away to the
first man that can ride him. Hal Dunbar heard about it and
sent up word that he was coming up to ride him."</p>

<p>"He must be a brave man," said Bull innocently. He had
an immense capacity for admiring others.</p>

<p>"Brave?" The proprietor paused as though this had not
occurred to him before. "Why, they ain't such a thing as
fear in Hal Dunbar, I guess. But if he decides to ride
Diablo, he'll ride him, well enough. He has his way about
things, Hal Dunbar does."</p>

<p>The sketchy portrait impressed Bull Hunter greatly. "You
know him, then?"</p>

<p>"How'd I be mistaking you for him if I knowed him? No,
he lives way down south, but they's a pile heard about him
that's never seen him."</p>

<p>For some reason the words of his host remained in the
mind of Bull as he went down the road that day. Oddly
enough, he pictured man and horse as being somewhat
alike&mdash;Diablo vast and black and fierce, and Hal
Dunbar dark and huge and terrible of eye, also; which was
proof enough that Bull Hunter was a good deal of a child.
He cared less about the world as it was than for the world
as it might be, and as long as life gave him something to
dream about, he did not care in the least about the facts
of existence.</p>

<p>Another man would have been worried about the future;
but Bull Hunter went down the road with his swinging
stride, perfectly at peace with himself and with life. He
had not enough money in his pocket to buy a meal, but he
was not thinking so far ahead.</p>

<p>It was still well before noon when he came in sight of
the Bridewell place. It varied not a whit from the typical
ranch of that region, a low-built collection of sheds and
arms sprawling around the ranch house itself. About the
building was a far-flung network of corrals. Bull Hunter
found his way among them and followed a sound of hammering.
He was well among the sheds when a great black stallion
shot into view around a nearby corner, tossing his head and
mane. He was pursued by a shrill voice crying, "Diablo!
Hey! You old fool! Stand still it's me it's Tod!"</p>

<p>To the amazement of Bull Hunter, Diablo the Terrible,
Diablo the man- killer, paused and reluctantly turned
about, shaking his head as though he did not wish to obey
but was compelled by the force of conscience. At once a
bare- legged boy of ten came in sight, running and shaking
his fist angrily at the giant horse. Indeed, it was a
tremendous animal. Not the seventeen hands that the hotel
proprietor had described to Bull, but a full sixteen three,
and so proudly high-headed, so stout-muscled of body,
so magnificently long and tapering of leg, that a wiser
horseman than the hotelkeeper might have put Diablo down
for more than seventeen hands.</p>

<p>Most tall horses are like tall men&mdash;they are
freakish and malformed in some of their members; but
Diablo was as trim as a pony. He had the high withers, the
mightily sloped shoulders, and the short back of a weight
carrier. And although at first glance his underpinning
seemed too frail to bear the great mass of his weight or
withstand the effort of his driving power of shoulders and
deep, broad thighs, yet a closer reckoning made one aware
of the comfortable dimensions of the cannon bone with all
that this feature portended. Diablo carried his bulk with
the grace which comes of compacted power well in hand.</p>

<p>Not that Bull Hunter analyzed the stallion in any such
fashion. He was, literally, ignorant of horseflesh. But
in spite of his ignorance the long neck, not overfleshed,
suggested length of stride and the mighty girth meant wind
beyond exhaustion and told of the great heart within. The
points of an ordinary animal may be overlooked, but a great
horse speaks for himself in every language and to every
man. He was coal-black, this Diablo, except for the white
stocking of his off forefoot; he was night-black, and so
silken sleek that, as he turned and pranced, flashes of
light glimmered from shoulders to flanks.</p>

<p>Bull Hunter stared in amazement that changed to
appreciation, and appreciation that burst in one
overpowering instant to the full understanding of the
beauty of the horse. Joy entered the heart of the big
man. He had looked on horses hitherto as pretty pictures
perhaps, but useless to him. Here was an animal that could
bear him like the wind wherever he would go. Here was a
horse who could gallop tirelessly under him all day and
labor through the mountains, bearing him as lightly as the
cattle ponies bore ordinary men. The cumbersome feeling
of his own bulk, which usually weighed heavily on Bull,
disappeared. He felt light of heart and light of limb.</p>

<p>In the meantime the bare-legged boy had come to the
side of the big horse, still shrilling his anger. He stood
under the lofty head of the stallion and shook his small
fist into the face of Diablo the Terrible. And while Bull,
quaking, expected to see the head torn from the shoulders
of the child, Diablo pointed his ears and sniffed the fist
of the boy inquisitively.</p>

<p>In fact, this could not be the horse of which the
hotelkeeper had told him, or perhaps he had been recently
tamed and broken?</p>

<p>That, for some reason, made the heart of Bull Hunter
sink.</p>

<p>The boy now reached up and twisted his fingers into the
mane of the black.</p>

<p>"Come along now. And if you pull away ag'in, you old
fool, Diablo, I'll give you a thumping, I tell you. Git
along!"</p>

<p>Diablo meekly lowered his head and made his step mincing
to regulate his gait to that of his tiny master. He was
brought alongside a rail fence. There he waited patiently
while the boy climbed up to the top rail and then slid onto
his back. Again Bull Hunter caught his breath. He expected
to see the stallion leap into the air and snap the child
high above his head with a single arching of his back, but
there was no such violent reaction. Diablo, indeed, turned
his head with his ears flattened and bared his teeth, but
it was only to snort at the knee of the boy. Plainly he was
bluffing, if horses ever bluffed. The boy carelessly dug
his brown toes into the cheek of the great horse and shoved
his head about.</p>

<p>"Giddap," he called. "Git along, Diablo!"</p>

<p>Diablo walked gently forward.</p>

<p>"Hurry up! I ain't got all day!" And the boy thumped the
giant with his bare heels.</p>

<p>Diablo broke into a trot as soft, as smooth flowing, as
water passing over a smooth bed of sand. Bull ran to the
corner of the shed and gaped after them until the pair slid
around a corner and were gone. Instinctively he drew off
his hat and gaped.</p>

<p>He was startled back to himself by loud laughter nearby,
and, looking up, he saw an old fellow in overalls with a
handful of nails and a hammer. He stood among a scattering
of uprights which represented, apparently, the beginnings
of the skeleton of a barn. Now he leaned against one of
these uprights and indulged his mirth. Bull regarded him
mildly; he was used to being laughed at.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER 14</h2>

<p class="first">"THAT's the way they all do," said the old
man. "They all gape the same fool way when they see Diablo
the first time."</p>

<p>"Is that the wild horse?" asked Bull in his gentle
voice. "That's him. I s'pose after seeing Tod handle him,
you'll want to try to ride him right off?"</p>

<p>Bull looked in the direction in which the horse had
disappeared. He swallowed a lump that had risen in his
throat and shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"Nope. You see, I dunno nothing about horses,
really."</p>

<p>The old man regarded him with a new and sudden
interest.</p>

<p>"Takes a wise man to call himself a fool," he declared
axiomatically.</p>

<p>Bull took this dubious bit of praise as an invitation
and came slowly closer to the other. He had the child's
way of eyeing a stranger with embarrassing steadiness at
a first meeting and thereafter paying little attention to
the face. He wrote the features down in his memory and kept
them at hand for reference, as it were. As he drew nearer,
the old man grew distinctly serious, and when Bull was
directly before him he gazed up into the face of Bull with
distinct amazement. At a distance the big man did not seem
so large because of the grace of his proportions; when he
was directly confronted, however, he seemed a veritable
giant.</p>

<p>"By the Lord, you are big. And who might you be,
stranger?"</p>

<p>"My name's Charlie Hunter; though mostly folks call me
just plain Bull."</p>

<p>"That's queer," chuckled the other. "Well, glad to know
you. I'm Bridewell."</p>

<p>They shook hands, and Bridewell noted the gentleness of
the giant. As a rule strong men are tempted to show their
strength when they shake hands; Bridewell appreciated the
modesty of Charlie Hunter.</p>

<p>"And you didn't come to ride Diablo?"</p>

<p>"No. I just stopped in to see him. And&mdash;" Bull
sighed profoundly.</p>

<p>"I know. He gives even me a touch now and then, though I
know what a devil he is!"</p>

<p>"Devil?" repeated Bull, astonished. "Why, he's as gentle
as a kitten!"</p>

<p>"Because you seen Tod ride him?" Bridewell laughed.
"That don't mean nothing. Tod can bully him, sure. But just
let a grown man come near him &mdash;with a saddle! That'll
change things pretty pronto! You'll see the finest little
bit of boiled-down hell-raising that ever was! The jingle
of a pair of spurs is Diablo's idea of a drum&mdash;and he
makes his charge right off! Gentle? Huh!" The grunt was
expressive. "And what good's a hoss if he can't be rode
with a saddle?" He waved the subject of Diablo into the
distance. "They ain't any hope unless Hal Dunbar can ride
him. If he can't, I'll shoot the beast!"</p>

<p>"Shoot him?" echoed Bull Hunter. He took a pace back,
and his big, boyish face clouded to a frown. "Not that, I
guess!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Bridewell, curious at the change in the
big stranger. "Why not? What good is he?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;he's good just to look at. I'd keep him just
for that."</p>

<p>"And you can have him just for that&mdash;if you can
manage to handle him. Want to try?"</p>

<p>Bull shook his head. "I don't know nothing about
horses," he confessed again. He glanced at the skeleton of
standing beams. "Building a barn, eh?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't call it pitching hay or shoeing a hoss
that I'm doing, I guess," said the old fellow crossly. "I'm
fussing at building a barn, but a fine chance I got. I get
all my timber here&mdash;look at that!"</p>

<p>He indicated the stacks of beams and lumber around
him.</p>

<p>"And then I get some men out of town to work with me on
it. But they get lonely. Don't like working on a ranch.
Besides, they had a scrap with me. I wouldn't have 'em
loafing around the job. Rather have no help at all than
have a loafer helping me. So they quit. Then I tried to get
my cowhands to give me a lift, but they wouldn't touch a
hammer. Specialists in cows is what they say they are, ding
bust 'em! So here I am trying to do something and doing
nothing. How can I handle a beam that it takes three men to
lift?"</p>

<p>He illustrated by going to a stack of long and massive
timbers and tugging at the end of one of them. He was able
to raise that end only a few inches.</p>

<p>"You see?"</p>

<p>Bull nodded.</p>

<p>"Suppose you give me the job handling the timbers?" he
suggested. "I ain't much good with a hammer and nails, but
I might manage the lifting."</p>

<p>"All by yourself? One man?" he eyed the bulk of Bull
hopefully for a moment, then the light faded from his face.
"Nope, you couldn't raise 'em. Not them joists yonder!"</p>

<p>"I think I could," said Bull.</p>

<p>Old Bridewell thrust out his jaw. He had been a
combative man in his youth; and he still had the instinct
of a fighter.</p>

<p>"I got ten dollars," he said, "that says you can't lift
that beam and put her up on end! That one right there, that
I tried to lift a minute ago!"</p>

<p>"All right," Bull nodded.</p>

<p>"You're on for the bet?" the old man chuckled gayly.
"All right. Let's see you give a heave!"</p>

<p>Bull Hunter obediently stepped to the timber. It was
a twelve footer of bulky dimensions, heavy wood not
thoroughly seasoned. Yet he did not approach one end of
it. He laid his immense hands on the center of it. Old
Bridewell chuckled to himself softly as he watched; he
was beginning to feel that the big stranger was a little
simple-minded. His chuckling ceased when he saw the timber
cant over on one edge.</p>

<p>"Look out!" he called, for Bull had slipped his hand
under the lifted side. "You'll get your fingers smashed
plumb off that way."</p>

<p>"I have to get a hold under it, you see," explained Bull
calmly, and so saying his knees sagged a little and when
they straightened the timber rose lightly in his hands and
was placed on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Where'd you like to have it?" asked Bull.</p>

<p>Bridewell rubbed his eyes. "Yonder," he said faintly.</p>

<p>Bull walked to the designated place, the great timber
teetering up and down, quivering with the jar of each
stride. There he swung one end to the ground and thrust the
other up until it was erect.</p>

<p>"Is this the way you want it?" said Bull.</p>

<p>By this time Bridewell had recovered his self-possession
to some degree, yet his eyes were wide as he approached.</p>

<p>"Yep. Just let it lean agin' that corner piece, will
you, Hunter?"</p>

<p>Bull obeyed.</p>

<p>"That might make a fellow's shoulder sort of sore," he
remarked, "if he had to carry those timbers all day."</p>

<p>"All day?" gasped Bridewell, and then he saw that the
giant, indeed, was not even panting from his effort. He was
already turning his attention to the pile of timbers.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, reluctantly drawing out some money.
"Here's your ten."</p>

<p>But Bull refused it. "Can't take it," he explained.
"I just made the bet by way of talk. You see, I knew I
could lift it; and you didn't have any real idea about me.
Besides, if I'd lost I couldn't have paid. I haven't any
money."</p>

<p>He said this so gravely and simply that old Bridewell
watched him quizzically, half suspecting that there was a
touch of irony hidden somewhere. It gradually dawned on him
that a man who was flat broke was refusing money which he
had won fairly on a bet. The idea staggered Bridewell. He
was within an ace of putting Bull Hunter down as a fool.
Something held him back, through some underlying respect
for the physical might of the big man and a respect, also,
for the honesty which looked out of his eyes. He pocketed
the money slowly. He was never averse to saving.</p>

<p>"But I've been thinking," said Bull, as he sadly watched
the money disappear, "that you might be needing me to help
you put up the barn? Do you think you could hire me?"</p>

<p>"H'm," grumbled Bridewell. "You think you could handle
these big timbers all day?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bull, "if none of 'em are any bigger than
that last one. Yes, I could handle 'em all day easily."</p>

<p>It was impossible to doubt that he said this judiciously
and not with a desire to overstate his powers. In spite of
himself the old rancher believed.</p>

<p>"You see," explained Bull eagerly, "you said that you
needed three men for that work. That's why I ask."</p>

<p>"And I suppose you'd want the pay of three men?"</p>

<p>Bull shook his head. "Anything you want to pay me," he
declared.</p>

<p>The rancher frowned. This sounded like the beginning
of a shrewd bargain, and his respect and suspicion were
equally increased.</p>

<p>"Suppose you say what you want?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well," Bull said slowly, "I'd have to have a place to
sleep. And&mdash; I'm a pretty big eater."</p>

<p>"I guess you are," said Bridewell. "But if you do three
men's work you got a right to three men's food. What else
do you want?"</p>

<p>Bull considered, as though there were few other
wishes that he could express. "I haven't any money," he
apologized. "D'you think maybe you could pay me a little
something outside of food and a place to sleep?"</p>

<p>Bridewell blinked, and then prepared himself to become
angry, when it dawned on him that this was not intended for
sarcasm. He found that Bull was searching his face eagerly,
as though he feared that he were asking too much.</p>

<p>"What would do you?" suggested Bridewell tentatively.</p>

<p>"I dunno," said Bull, sighing with relief. "Anything you
think."</p>

<p>It was plain that the big man was half-witted&mdash;or
nearly so. Bridewell kept the sparkle of exultation out of
his eyes.</p>

<p>"You leave it to me, then, and I'll do what's more'n
right by you. When d'you want to start work?"</p>

<p>"Right now."</p>

<h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER 15</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Bull left the dining room that night
after supper, Mrs. Bridewell looked across the table at her
husband with horror in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Did you see?" she gasped. "He ate the <i>whole</i> pot of
beans!"</p>

<p>"Sure I seen him," and he grinned.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;he'll eat us out of house and home! Why, he's
like a wolf!"</p>

<p>Bridewell chuckled with superior knowledge. "He's ate
enough for three," he admitted, "but he's worked enough
for six&mdash;besides, most of his wages come in food.
But work? I never seen anything like it! He handled more
timbers than a dozen. When it come to spiking them in
place he seen me swinging that twelve-pound sledge and
near breaking my back. 'I think it's easier this way,' he
says. 'Besides you can hit a lot faster if you use just one
hand.' And he takes the hammer, and sends that big spike in
all the way to the head with one lick. And he wondered why
I didn't work the same way! Ain't got any idea how strong
he is."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridewell listened with wide eyes. "The idea," she
murmured. "The idea! Where's he now?"</p>

<p>Her husband went to the back door. "He's sitting over by
the pump talking to Tod. Sitting talking like they was one
age. I reckon he's sort of half- witted."</p>

<p>"How come?" sharply asked Mrs. Bridewell. "Ain't Tod got
more brains than most growed-up men?"</p>

<p>"I reckon he has," admitted the proud father.</p>

<p>And if they had put the same question to Bull Hunter,
the giant would have agreed with them emphatically. He
approached the child tamer of Diablo with a diffidence that
was almost reverence. The freckle-faced boy looked up from
his whittling when the shadow of Bull fell athwart him,
with an equal admiration; also with suspicion, for the
cowpunchers, on the whole, were apt to make game of the
youngster and his grave, grown-up ways. He was, therefore,
shrewdly suspicious of jests at his expense.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he had seen the big stranger heaving the
great timbers about and whirling the sledge with one hand;
he half suspected that the jokes might be pointed with the
weight of that heavy hand. His amazement was accordingly
great when he found the big man actually sitting down
beside him, cross-legged, and he was absolutely stupefied
when Bull Hunter said, "I've been aiming at this chance to
talk to you, Tod, all day."</p>

<p>"H'm," grunted Tod noncommittally, and examined the
other with a cautious side glance.</p>

<p>But the face of Bull Hunter was unutterably free from
guile. Tod instantly began to adjust himself. The men he
most worshiped were the lean, swift, profanely formidable
cowpunchers. But there was something in him that responded
with a thrill to this accepted equality with such a man as
Bull Hunter. Even his father he had seen stricken to an
awed silence at the sight of Bull's prowess.</p>

<p>"You see," explained Bull frankly, "I been wondering how
you managed to handle Diablo the way you do."</p>

<p>Tod chuckled. "It's just a trick. You watch me a while
with him, you'll soon catch on."</p>

<p>But Bull shook his head as he answered, "Maybe a mighty
bright man might figure it out, but I'm not good at
figuring things out, Tod."</p>

<p>The boy blinked. He was accustomed to the studied
understatement of the cowpunchers and he was accustomed,
also, to their real vanity which underlay the surface
shyness. But it was patent that Bull Hunter, in spite of
his size, was truly humble. This conception was new to Tod
and slowly grew in his brain. His active eyes ran over the
bulk beside him; he almost pitied the giant.</p>

<p>"Besides," pondered Bull heavily, "I guess there's a
whole lot of bright men that have seen you handle Diablo,
but they couldn't make out what you did. They tried to
ride Diablo and got their necks nearly broken. They were
good riders, but I'm not. You see, Diablo's the first
horse I've ever seen that could really carry me." He added
apologetically, "I'm so heavy."</p>

<p>No vanity, certainly. He gestured toward himself as
though he were ashamed of his brawn, and the heart of Tod
warmed and expanded. He himself would never be large,
and his heart had ached because of his smallness many a
time.</p>

<p>"Yep," he said judiciously, "you're pretty heavy. About
the heaviest I ever seen, I guess. Maybe Hal Dunbar is as
big, but I never seen Hal."</p>

<p>"I've heard a good deal about Hal, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short and stiffened. Tod saw that the eyes of
the big man had fixed on the corral in which stood Diablo.
A puff of wind had come, and the great black had thrown up
his head into it, an imposing picture with mane and tail
blown sidewise. Not until the stallion turned away from the
unseen thing which he had scented in the wind, did Bull
turn to his small companion with a sigh.</p>

<p>Tod nodded, his eyes glinting. "I know," he said. "I
used to feel that way&mdash;before I learned how to handle
Diablo." He interpreted, "You feel like it'd be pretty
fine to get onto Diablo's back and have him gallop under
you."</p>

<p>"About the finest thing in the world," sighed Bull
Hunter. He cast out his great hands before him as he tried
to explain the mysterious emotions which the horse had
excited in him. "You see, Tod, I'm pretty big and I'm
pretty slow. Most folks have horses, and they get about
pretty lively on 'em, but I've always had to walk."</p>

<p>The enormity of this lack made Tod stare, for travel and
horses were inseparably connected in his mind. He shuddered
a little at the thought of the big man stalking across the
burning and interminable sands of the desert or toiling
through the mountains. It seemed to him that he could see
the signs of that pain stamped in the face of Bull Hunter,
and his heart leaped again in sympathy.</p>

<p>"So when I saw Diablo&mdash;" Bull paused. But Tod had
understood. Suddenly the boy became excited.</p>

<p>"Suppose you was to learn to ride Diablo before Hal
Dunbar come to try him out? Suppose that?"</p>

<p>"Could you teach me?" the giant asked in an almost awed
whisper.</p>

<p>The child looked over his companion with a vague wonder.
It would be a tremendous responsibility, this teaching of
the giant, but what could be more spectacular than to have
such a man as his pupil? But to share his unique empire
over Diablo&mdash;that would be a great price to pay!</p>

<p>"No," he decided, "it wouldn't do. Besides, suppose even
I <i>could</i>teach you how to ride Diablo&mdash;with a saddle,
which I don't think I could&mdash;what would happen when
Hal Dunbar come up to these parts and found that the hoss
he wanted was somebody else's? He'd make an awful fuss
&mdash;and he's a fighting man, Bull."</p>

<p>He said this impressively, leaning a little toward the
giant, and he was rewarded infinitely by seeing the right
hand of the giant stir a little toward the holster at his
thigh.</p>

<p>"I guess I'd have to take my chance with him," was all
Bull answered in his mildest tone.</p>

<p>Tod was beginning to guess that there was a certain
amount of mental strength under this quiet exterior. He
had often noted that his father, who made by far the most
noise, was more easily placated than his mother, in spite
of her gentle silences. The strength of Bull Hunter had a
strain of the same thing about it.</p>

<p>"You'd take a chance with Hal Dunbar?" he repeated
wonderingly. He trembled a little, with a sort of nervous
ecstasy at the thought of that coming encounter. "That's
more'n anybody else in these parts would do. Why,
everybody's heard about Hal Dunbar. Everybody's scared of
him. He can ride anything that's big enough to carry him;
he can fight like a wildcat with his hands; and he can
shoot like"&mdash;his eye wandered toward a superlative
&mdash;"like Pete Reeve, almost," he concluded with a tone
of awe.</p>

<p>A spark of tenderness shone in the eye of Bull. "D'you
know Pete Reeve?"</p>

<p>"No, and I don't want to. Ma had a brother once, and he
met up with Pete Reeve."</p>

<p>A tragedy was inferred in that oblique reference. Bull
decided that this was a conversational topic on which he
must remain silent, and yet he yearned to speak of the
little withered catlike fellow with the wise brain who had
done so much for him.</p>

<p>"When I'm big enough," mused the boy with a quiet
savagery, "maybe I'll meet up with Pete Reeve."</p>

<p>Bull switched the talk to a more comfortable topic. "But
how'd you make a start with that man-eating Diablo?"</p>

<p>Tod studied, the question. "I got a way with hosses, you
see," he began modestly.</p>

<p>He played two brown fingers in his mouth and sent out
a shrilling whistle that was answered immediately by a
whinny, and a little chestnut gelding, sun- faded to a sand
color nearly, cantered into view around the corner of a
shed and approached them. He came to a pause nearby, and
having studied Bull Hunter with large, unafraid, curious
eyes for a moment, began to nibble impertinently at the
ragged hat brim of the child.</p>

<p>"Git away!" exclaimed Tod, and when the chestnut made
no move to go, the brown fist flashed up at the reaching
head. But the head was jerked away with a motion of catlike
deftness.</p>

<p>"He's a terrible bother, Crackajack is," said the boy
angrily, and from the corner of his eye he stole a glance
of unspeakable pride at the big man.</p>

<p>"He's a beauty," exclaimed Bull Hunter. "A regular
beauty!"</p>

<p>For Crackajack combined the toughness of a mustang
and the lean, strong running lines of a thoroughbred in
miniature. His legs were as delicately made as the legs of
a deer; his head was a little model of impish intelligence
and beauty.</p>

<p>"You and Crackajack are pals," said Bull. "I guess
that's what you are!"</p>

<p>"We get on tolerable well," admitted the boy, whose
heart was full with this praise of his pet.</p>

<p>Bull continued on the agreeable topic. "And I'll bet
he's fast, too. He looks like speed to me!"</p>

<p>"Maybe you don't know hosses, but you sure got hoss
sense." Tod chuckled. "Most folks take Crackajack for a toy
pony. He ain't. I've seen him carry a full-grown man all
day and keep up with the best of 'em. He don't mind the
weight of me no more'n if I was a feather. He's fast, he's
tough, and he knows more'n a hoss should know, you might
say!"</p>

<p>He changed his voice, and a brief command made
Crackajack give up his teasing and retreat. Bull watched
the exquisite little creature go, with a smile of pleasure.
He did not know it, but that smile unlocked the last door
to Tod's heart.</p>

<p>"He was pretty near as wild as Diablo when I first got
him," said the boy. "And mean&mdash;say, he'd been kicked
around all his life. But I fatted him up in the barn, and
he got so's he'd follow me around. And now he runs loose
like a dog and comes when I whistle. He knows more things
than you could shake a stick at, Crackajack does." "I'll
bet he does," said Bull with shining eyes.</p>

<p>"Say," said the boy suddenly, "I'm going to tell you
about the way I worked with Diablo."</p>

<p>"I'll take that mighty kind," said Bull gratefully.
"D'you think I'd have a chance with him even if you showed
me how?"</p>

<p>"You got to have a way with hosses," admitted the boy,
and he examined Bull again. "But I think you'll get on with
hossflesh pretty well. When Diablo first come, he used to
go plumb crazy when anybody come near his corral. He still
does if a growed man comes there. Well, they used to go out
and stand and watch him and laugh at him prancing around
and kicking up a fuss at the sight of 'em.</p>

<p>"And it made me mad. Made me plumb mad to see them
bother Diablo when he wasn't doing no harm, when they
wasn't gaining anything by it, either."</p>

<p>"I used to go out when nobody was around and stand by
the bars with a bit of hay and grain heads in my hand.
First off he'd prance around even at me, but pretty soon he
seen that I wasn't big enough to do him no harm, and then
he'd just stand still and snort and look at me. Along about
the third time he took notice of the grain heads and come
and smelled them, and the next day he ate 'em.</p>

<p>"Well, I kept at it that way. Pretty soon I went
inside the corral. Diablo just come up sort of excited
and trembling and didn't know whether to bash my head in
with his forehoofs or let me go. Then he seen the grain
heads and ate them while he was making up his mind what
to do about me. And he winded up by just having a little
talk with me. He was terribly dirty and dusty, and he
was shedding. Nobody dared to brush him, and so I took
a soft-haired brush and started to work on his neck. He
liked it, and so I dressed him down and left him pretty
near shining. And every day after that I went and had a
talk with him and brushed him. Then I rode Crackajack up
to the bars and let Diablo see me on him, with no bridle
or saddle. Pretty soon I found out that it was the saddle
and the bridle and the spurs that scared Diablo to death.
He didn't mind anything else so very much. So one day I
climbed up the fence and slid onto Diablo's back, and he
just turned his head and snorted at me. Just then Pa seen
me and let out a terrible yell, and Diablo pitched me right
off over his head and over the fence. But I got right up
and came back to him. He seen that he could get me off
whenever he wanted to and he seen that I didn't do him no
harm when I got on.</p>

<p>"After that everything was easy. I never bothered him
none with a saddle or a bridle. And there you are. D'you
think you can do the same?"</p>

<p>"But the saddle and the bridle?" said Bull. "What about
them?"</p>

<p>"That's up to you to figure out a way of getting him
used to 'em. I'll go introduce you now, if I can."</p>

<p>Bull rose, and the boy led the way.</p>

<p>"If he takes to you pretty kind," said the boy, "you may
have a chance. But if he begins acting up, it won't be no
use."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16" name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER 16</h2>

<p class="first">DIABLO greeted them with a throwing up of
his formidable head. He took his place in the very middle
of his corral, but when Bull Hunter and his small guide
reached the bars, the black stallion seemed to go suddenly
mad. He flung himself into the air and came down bucking.
Back and forth across the corral he threw himself in the
wildest swirl of pitching that Bull Hunter had ever seen or
ever dreamed of.</p>

<p>"He's an educated bucker, you see?" said the boy in
admiration. "They ain't any trick that he don't know.
Look!"</p>

<p>Diablo had begun to sunfish in the most approved method,
and swirled from this to some fence rowing as swift as the
jagged course of lightning. At every jump Bull could see an
imaginary rider snapped from the back of the black giant.
A cloud of dust was sent swishing up, and in the midst of
this fog, Diablo came to a pause as sudden as the beginning
of his strange struggle against an imaginary foeman; but it
seemed to Bull Hunter that the ground beneath his feet was
still quivering from the impacts of that mighty body.</p>

<p>"That's just his way of telling you what he'll do when
you try to saddle him," chuckled the boy.</p>

<p>As he spoke he slipped through the bars of the
corral.</p>

<p>"Look out!" exclaimed Bull in horror, for the stallion
had rushed at the small intruder with gaping mouth. Bull
reached for his gun&mdash;Diablo was already on the child,
but at the last minute he swerved, and flashed around Tod
in a circle.</p>

<p>"He's all right," Tod was shrilling through his
laughter, for the horrified face of Bull amused him.
"That's just his way of saying that he's glad to see
me!"</p>

<p>In fact, Diablo came to a sudden halt directly behind
the child, his head towering aloft above that of Tod while
he flashed his defiance at Bull Hunter, as though he
were making use of the small bulwark of Tod against the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Diablo, you old fool," the boy was saying, as he
reached up and managed to wind his fingers in the end of
Diablo's mane, "you come along and meet my friend, Bull
Hunter. I figure you're going to get to know him pretty
good before long. Hey, Bull, come up close to the bars so's
he can see you ain't got a rope or a whip or spurs, and
stick your hand out so's he can sniff at it. That's his way
of saying how d'ye do."</p>

<p>Bull obeyed, and to his amazement, Diablo responded to
the small forward urge of the child's hand and approached
the bars one trembling step at a time. Bull began to talk
to him softly. He had never talked like this to any living
creature. He did not know exactly what he said. The words
came of their own accord into his throat. He only knew that
he wanted to reassure the big, powerful, uncertain brute,
and though Diablo stopped short at the first sound of
Bull's voice and laid his ears back, he presently pricked
one of those ears again and allowed himself to be drawn
forward with long, crouching strides.</p>

<p>"That's the way!" said the child softly, as though he
feared that a loud voice might break in upon the spell.
"You know how to talk to him! And, outside of me, you're
the only one that does! I knew you'd have it in you!"</p>

<p>For Diablo had extended his long neck and actually
sniffed the hand of Bull Hunter. He immediately tossed his
head aloft, but he did not flinch away.</p>

<p>"That's half the fight won already," advised the boy in
the same soft voice. "D'you want to try the saddle on him
now?"</p>

<p>"The saddle? Now?" exclaimed Bull. "I should say not!
Why, he don't hardly know me; I'll have to get acquainted
before I try anything like that."</p>

<p>He discovered that Tod was nodding in hearty
approval.</p>

<p>"You do know," he said. "Don't tell me that you ain't
been around hosses a pile. Yep, you got to get acquainted.
What you want to do now?"</p>

<p>Bull considered. "I'd like to have something to show him
that it isn't unpleasant having me around. I'd like to have
him see some good results, you know? Is there anything I
could feed him?"</p>

<p>The boy chuckled. "Best thing is some dried prunes with
the pits taken out of 'em. I have some at the house. They
get stuck in Diablo's teeth and it's sure funny to see him
eat 'em. But he just nacherally plumb likes the taste of
the prunes."</p>

<p>He followed his own suggestion by scampering away to the
house and returned almost at once with a hat full of the
prunes.</p>

<p>"You want to feed him these now?"</p>

<p>"First," said Bull, "I'd like to have you leave us
alone. If I can't teach him to like me all by myself, then
I'd better give up right away."</p>

<p>The boy looked at him in surprise and then impulsively
stretched out his hand. They shook hands gravely.</p>

<p>"You got the right idea, pardner," said Tod. "Go
ahead&mdash;and good luck! And keep talking to him all the
time. That's the main thing!"</p>

<p>He retreated accordingly, but before the evening was
over, Bull regretted dismissing his little ally so quickly,
for although Diablo indulged in no more threatening
outbreaks of temper, he resolutely refused to eat the
prunes from Bull's hand. Several times he approached the
bars of the corral and the patiently extended hand, but
always he drew back, snorting, and sometimes he would run
around the corral, shaking his head and throwing up his
heels after the manner of a horse tempted but still afraid
of being overruled.</p>

<p>It was long after dark when Bull gave up the attempt.
He went back to the bunkhouse, rolled up the blankets
which had been assigned to him, and carried them out to
the corral. Close to the fence he laid them down, and a
few minutes later he was wrapped in them and sound asleep.
The last thing he remembered was the form of the great
stallion, standing watchfully in the exact middle of the
corral, the starlight glimmering very faintly in his big
eyes.</p>

<p>Bull Hunter fell asleep and had a nightmare of the
arrival of the famous Hal Dunbar the next day, a fierce
conquest of Diablo, and the battle ending with the
departure of Dunbar on the back of the stallion.</p>

<p>The dream waked him, nervous, and he turned and saw
Diablo standing huge and formidable in the darkness, as
though he had not moved from his first position.</p>

<p>In the morning the arduous labors of the building began
again, and though the prodigious appetite of Bull at the
breakfast table made even old Bridewell look askance,
Bull had not been at work an hour handling the ponderous
uprights and joists before his employer was smiling to
himself. His new hand was certainly worth his keep, and
more, for weariness seemed a stranger to that big body,
and no weight was too great to be cheerily assumed. And
always he worked with a sort of nervous anxiety as though
he feared that he might not be doing enough.</p>

<p>During the day Bridewell attempted to probe the past
history of his hired man, expecting a story as big as the
body of the man, but Bull was discreetly vague, for he had
no wish to reveal his connection with Pete Reeve; and if
he left out Reeve, he felt that there was nothing in his
life worth talking about. Many a time he wondered what the
little gunfighter was doing, and what trail he was riding
now. A dangerous trail, he doubted not, and a lawless
trail, he greatly feared. But someday he might be able to
find the terrible little man and bring him back to a truer
place in society.</p>

<p>That night he began again the long, quiet struggle with
Diablo; and before he ended, Diablo had gathered some of
the dried fruit from the palm of his hand with a sensitive,
trembling pair of lips. And he had come back for more,
and more. Yet it was not until the next night that Bull
ventured inside the bars of the corral and sat cross-legged
on the ground, with a vague feeling that Diablo would be
less alarmed if his visitor bulked less large.</p>

<p>Inside the bars he seemed an entirely new proposition
to the stallion. The big black kept discreetly on the far
side of the corral with much snorting and stamping, and it
was not until the next evening that he ventured to approach
the man. Still another day passed before Bull was allowed
to stand and touch the neck of the black; and that, it
seemed to him, was the greatest forward step toward the
conquest.</p>

<p>It was terribly slow work, and in the meantime the
skeleton frame of the barn was fast rising. Would he
accomplish his purpose by the time the barn was completed
and Bridewell no longer had a use for him? Or would Hal
Dunbar arrive before that appointed time? That night,
however, another portentous event happened. Waking in the
night, Bull heard a sound of deep, regular breathing close
to him, and, turning on his side, he saw that Diablo had
lain down as close to him as the corral fence would allow,
and there he slept, panther- black, sleek in the starlight.
Bull stretched out his hand. The head of the stallion
jerked up, but a moment later he carelessly sniffed the
extended fingers and resumed his position of repose. And
the heart of Bull Hunter swelled with triumph.</p>

<p>That event gave him a new idea, and the following
evening he made a groundwork of branches in the corner
of the corral itself, and put down his blankets on the
evergreens. Diablo was much concerned and walked about
examining the new work from every angle. There Bull slept,
and the next night he found that during the day the
stallion had torn the boughs to pieces and scattered them
about. He patiently laid a new foundation, and after this
the bed was left strictly alone.</p>

<p>In the meantime Bull had made a light, strong halter
of rawhide, and after several attempts he managed to slip
it onto the head of Diablo. Once in place, it was easy to
teach Diablo that he must follow when he felt a pull on
the halter&mdash;the first steps were rewarded with dried
prunes, and after that it was simple.</p>

<p>On that evening, also, Bull made his next step forward
toward the most difficult proposition of all&mdash;he
took a partly filled barley sack and put it on the back
of Diablo. The next moment the sack was shot into the air
as Diablo leaped up and arched his back like a cat at the
height of his leap. He came down trembling and snorting,
but Bull picked up the fallen sack and allowed him to
smell it. Diablo found that the smell was good and that
the hateful sack even contained things very good to eat.
The next time the sack was put on his back he quivered and
shrank, but he did not buck it off.</p>

<p>After that, Bull spent his evenings in gradually
increasing the weight of that sack until a full hundred
pounds caused Diablo no worry whatever, and when this point
had been attained, Bull decided that he might venture his
own bulk on the back of Diablo. He confided his purpose
to Tod, and the boy, greatly excited, hid himself at a
distance to watch.</p>

<p>In the beginning it was deceptively easy. Diablo stood
perfectly unconcerned as Bull raised himself on the bars of
the fence. And when the long legs of Bull were passed over
his back, Diablo merely turned his head and sniffed the
shoe tentatively. Slowly, very softly, steadying himself
on the top bar of the fence, Bull lowered his weight more
and more until the whole burden was on the back of the
stallion&mdash;and then he took his hands from the top
rail.</p>

<p>But the moment he released that grip there was a change
in Diablo, as though he realized that the man had suddenly
trusted himself entirely to his mount. Bull felt a sudden
wincing of all that great body; the quarters sank and
trembled. He thought at first that it was because the horse
was failing under the weight of this ponderous burden; but
instinct told him a moment later that it was fear, and a
mixture of suspicious anger.</p>

<p>Diablo took one of his long, catlike steps, and paused
without bringing up his other foot. In vain Bull spoke to
him, softly, steadily. Diablo took another step, quickened
to a soft trot, and stopped suddenly. That weight on his
back failed to leave him. He began to tremble violently.
Bull felt the sudden thundering of the great heart beneath
the pressure of his knee.</p>

<p>To the stallion, this man had been a friend, a
constant companion. The touch of his hand was pleasant.
Pleasanter still was the continual deep murmur of the
voice, reassuring, telling him of a superior and guardian
mind looking out for his interests. Now that hand was
stroking his sleek neck and that voice was steadily in
his ear. But the position was the most hated one. To be
sure, there was no saddle, no cutting, binding cinch, no
drag of cruel Spanish curb to control his head, no tearing
spurs to threaten him. But his flanks twitched where the
spurs had dug in many a time, and he panted, remembering
the cinches. Those memories built up a panic. He became
unsure. The voice reached him less distinctly. Moreover it
was a strange time of the evening. The light of the day was
nearly done; the moon was barely up, and all things were
ghostly and unreal in that slant light.</p>

<p>Something of all that went through the mind of Diablo
was understood by Bull Hunter. It was telegraphed to him
by the twitching and vibration of great muscles, by the
stiff arching of the neck, and the snorting breathing.
But he was beginning to forget fear. The stallion danced
lightly forward, and as the wind struck the face of Bull
Hunter he suddenly rejoiced. This was what he had dreamed
of, to be carried thus lightly, easily. The weight that had
crushed other horses was nothing to Diablo. It made him
feel buoyant. He became tinglingly alert. On the back of
Diablo not a horse of the mountains could overtake him if
he fled; and not a man of the mountains could escape him if
he pursued on the back of the stallion.</p>

<p>That thought had hardly formed in his excited mind when
Diablo sprang, cat-footed, to one side. It made Bull Hunter
sway, and he naturally sought to preserve his balance by
gripping the powerful barrel of the horse with his knees.
But at the first touch of the knee Diablo went suddenly
mad. Exactly what he did Bull Hunter never knew. Indeed,
it seemed that Diablo left his feet, shot a dizzy height
into the air, and at the crest of his rise did three or
four things at once. At any rate, as the stallion landed,
Bull pitched from the arched back and hurtled forward and
to the right side. He landed heavily against the ground,
his head striking a small rock; and he lay there a moment,
stunned.</p>

<p>Far off he heard Tod shrilling at him, "Bull! Are you
hurt?"</p>

<p>He gathered himself together and arose, "I'm all right.
Stay where you are!"</p>

<p>"Don't try him again. He'll kill you, Bull!"</p>

<p>"Maybe. But I'm going to try."</p>

<p>Diablo stood on the far side of the corral in the
moonlight, a splendid figure with haughty tail and head.
Inwardly he was trembling, enraged. He knew what would
come. He had thrown men before, and usually he had tried
to batter them to pieces after they fell. This man he
had no desire to batter. There had been no saddle, no
bridle, no spurs, no quirt&mdash;nevertheless, he must not
be controlled by the hand of any man! But having thrown
the fellow, now other men would run on him, swinging the
accursed ropes over their heads, shouting, cursing at him
in strident voices. Vitally he yearned to break through the
bars of the corral and flee, but the bars were there and he
must stay in the inclosure with this friendly enemy. It was
not the prostrate man he feared so much as vengeance from
other men, for that had always been the way.</p>

<p>But no one came. No shouts were heard except from the
small, thin, familiar voice of Tod. And presently the giant
arose from the ground where he had fallen and came toward
him. Diablo flattened his ears expectantly. At the first
throat-tearing curse he would charge. But no curse came.
The man approached, as always, with extended hand, and the
voice was the smooth, gentle murmur that carries peace into
the shadowy mind of a horse.</p>

<p>Something relaxed in Diablo. If the man did not resent
being thrown off &mdash;if that were a sort of game, as it
were&mdash;why should he, Diablo, resent having the man on
his back? The hand touched his nose gently; another hand
was stroking his neck.</p>

<p>Presently he was led to the fence and again that heavy
weight slid onto his back. He crouched again, with waves of
blind panic surging up in him, but the panic did not master
his sense this time, and as his brain cleared he began
to discover that there was no urging, no will of another
imposed upon him. He could walk where he pleased, following
his own sweet will, or else he could stand still. It made
no difference; but the soft-touching hand and the deep,
quiet voice were assuring him that the man was glad to be
up there on his back.</p>

<p>Diablo turned his head. One ear quivered and came
forward tentatively; then the other. He had accepted Bull
Hunter.</p>

<p>Afterward Bull found Tod. The boy wrung his hand
ecstatically.</p>

<p>"That's what I call game!" he said.</p>

<p>"Why, Tod," the big man smiled, "you did the same
thing."</p>

<p>"He knew I was nothing. But you're a growed man.
But&mdash;what's this, Bull? Your back's all wet."</p>

<p>"It's nothing much," said Bull calmly. "When I fell, my
head hit a stone. There's some things worth paying for, and
Diablo's one of them."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17" name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>

<p class="first">THE cut proved, as he had said, to be a
small thing; but it turned out that Diablo was far from
won. He was haltered and he would carry Bull bareback.
The saddle was quite another affair. So Bull returned to
the idea of the barley sack, with gradual additions. On
each side of the sack he attached hanging straps. Diablo
snorted at these and tried them with his teeth. They
reminded him vaguely of the swinging stirrups that had so
often battered his tender sides. He discovered that the
straps were not alive, however, and were not harmful. And
when their length was increased and an uncovered stirrup
was tied on each side, he gradually became accustomed to
these also. The next stage was passing the straps under
his belly. They were tied there loosely, the circle was
completed, and Diablo, examining them critically, found
nothing wrong. Then, a dozen times in a single evening,
the straps were drawn up, tighter and tighter, until they
touched him. At this he became excited, and it required
all the resourcefulness of Bull to quiet him. But in three
days the barley sack and its queer-looking additions had
been changed for a true saddle&mdash;with the cinches drawn
up tight enough for riding. And this without eliciting a
single bucking spasm from Diablo!</p>

<p>Not even to Tod did Bull Hunter impart his great
tidings. He had not yet climbed into that real saddle;
Diablo had not yet heard the creak of the stirrup leathers
under the weight of his rider. Indeed, there was still much
to be done before the happy day when he saddled the black
stallion and took down the bars of the corral gate and
rode him out. And rode him without a bit! For on the point
of steel in the mouth of Diablo, Bull Hunter knew that
the horse would be against it resolutely. So he confined
himself to a light hackamore alone. That was enough, for
Diablo had learned to rein over the neck and stop at the
slightest pull of the reins.</p>

<p>The next morning he went out to his work with a light
heart. They had had the help of several new men during the
past ten days and now the frame of the roof was almost
completed. It would not be long before Bull's services
could be dispensed with and he connected the idea of the
completion of the barn in a symbolic fashion with the
completion of his conquest of the stallion. The two would
be accomplished in the same moment, as it were. No wonder,
then, that as he climbed the ladder up the side of the
barn, with the ladder quaking beneath his weight, Bull
Hunter began to sing, his thundering bass ringing among the
ranch buildings until Mrs. Bridewell opened the kitchen
window to hear the better, and old Bridewell stopped his
ears in mock dismay at the thunder of Bull's voice.</p>

<p>But the work was not two hours old when little Tod
scampered up to his side.</p>

<p>"Bull," he whispered, "Hal Dunbar is down yonder with
a couple of men. He's come to ride Diablo. What'll we do,
Bull? What'll we do?"</p>

<p>"Diablo will throw him," said Bull with conviction.</p>

<p>"But he won't. He can't," stammered the boy in his
excitement. "Nothing could throw Hal Dunbar. Wait till you
see him! Just you wait till you see. Gee, Bull, he's as big
as you and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The other qualifications were apparently too amazing to
be adequately described by the vocabulary of Tod.</p>

<p>"If any other man can ride Diablo," said Bull at length,
"I don't think I care about him so much. I've been figuring
that I'm the only man who can get on his back. If somebody
else can handle him, they're welcome to the horse as far as
I'm concerned."</p>

<p>"Are you going to let him go like that?" Tod was bitter
with shame and anger. "After all our work, are you going to
give him up without a fight?"</p>

<p>"A fight would be a gunfight, and a gunfight ends up
in a death," said Bull gently. "I don't like bloodshed,
Tod!"</p>

<p>The boy writhed. Here was an idol smashed with a
vengeance!</p>

<p>"I might of knowed!" he groaned. "You ain't nothing
but&mdash;but a big hulk!"</p>

<p>And he turned on his heel and gave the exciting news to
his father.</p>

<p>For an event of this caliber, Bridewell called down all
his men from the building, and they started for the corral.
Hal Dunbar and his two men already were standing close to
the bars, and Diablo stood quivering, high-headed, in the
center of the inclosure. But, of the picture, the attention
of Bull Hunter centered mainly on Hal Dunbar.</p>

<p>His dreams of the man had been true. He was a huge
fellow, as tall as Bull, or taller, and nearly as bulky.
But about Bull Hunter there was a suggestion of ponderous
unwieldiness, and there was none of that suggestion about
Hal Dunbar. He was lithe and straight as a poplar, and as
supple in his movements. The poise of his head and the
alertness of his body and something of lightness in his
whole posture told of the trained athlete. Providence had
given the man a marvelous body, and he had improved it
to the uttermost. To crown all, there was a remarkably
handsome face, dark eyes and coal-black hair.</p>

<p>Yet, more than the imposing body of this hero of the
ranges, Bull was impressed by the spirit of the man. The
thing that Tod had felt, he felt in turn. It shone from
the eye, it spoke in the set of Dunbar's mouth, something
unconquerable. It was impossible, after a single glance, to
imagine this man failing. Diablo, it was true, had the same
invincible air. Indeed, they seemed meant for each other,
this horse and this man. They might have been picked from
a crowd and the one assigned to the other. Huge, lithe,
fleet, powerful, and fiercely free, surely Hal Dunbar was
intended by fate to sit in the saddle and govern Diablo
according to his will.</p>

<p>The heart of Charlie Hunter sank. Here was the end,
then, of all the love he had put into his work, of all the
feminine gentleness with which he had petted Diablo and
soothed him. And he discovered, in that bitter moment, that
he had not worked merely to gain control of the horse.
There would be no joy in making Diablo bend to his will.
His aim was, and from the first unconsciously had been, to
win Diablo so that the stallion would serve him joyously
and freely out of the love he bore him. As he thought of
this, his glance rested on the long, spoon-handled spurs of
big Hal Dunbar.</p>

<p>Dunbar was shaking hands with Bridewell, leaning a
trifle over the little old man.</p>

<p>"Here's one that'll be sorry to see you ride Diablo,"
said Bridewell. He pointed to Hunter. "He's been working
weeks, trying to make a pet out of the hoss."</p>

<p>"A pet out of him? A pet?" echoed Dunbar.</p>

<p>He measured Bull Hunter with a certain bright interest.
The sleeves of Bull were rolled up to the elbows and down
the forearms ran the tangling masses of muscle. But the
interest of Dunbar was only monetary. Presently his lip
curled slightly, and he turned his haughty head toward the
great stallion.</p>

<p>"I'll do something more than pet him. Ill make something
useful out of the big brute. Saddle him, boys!"</p>

<p>He gestured carelessly, and his two attendants started
toward the corral, one with a heavy saddle and one with
a rope. As he stood rolling his cigarette and watching
negligently, he impressed Bull as a veritable knight of the
ranges, a baron with baronial adherents. It came partly
from his splendid stature, and more from his flauntingly
rich costume. The heavy gold braid on the sombrero, the
gilded spurs, the brilliant silk shirt would have been
out of place on another man, but they fit in with Hal
Dunbar. They were adjuncts to the pride of his face. Bull's
attention wavered to Tod.</p>

<p>"Are&mdash;are they going to rope Diablo?"</p>

<p>Tod flashed a half-disgusted, half-despairing glance up
at his companion.</p>

<p>"What d'you think they're going to do? What do you
think?"</p>

<p>Bull turned away, sick hearted. He could not bear the
thought of the great stallion struggling helpless in the
snaky coils of the rope. But of course there was no other
way. Yet his muscles tightened, and the perspiration poured
out on his forehead as he heard a shout from one of the
men, then a brief drumming of Diablo's hoofs, and finally
the heavy thud as the stallion struck full length on the
ground.</p>

<p>That sound stunned Bull as though he had received a blow
himself. Every nerve in him was tingling, revolting against
the brutality. They were idiots, hopeless fools, to dream
of conquering Diablo by brute force. And if they succeeded,
they would have a broken-spirited horse on their hands,
worse than useless, or else a treacherous man-killer to the
end of his days.</p>

<p>He looked again. Diablo, saddled and blindfolded was
being driven out of the corral; a man held him on either
side, and his mouth, dragged out, was already bleeding from
the cruel Spanish bit. At that Bull Hunter saw red.</p>

<p>When his senses returned to him, he went hurriedly to
Dunbar.</p>

<p>"Friend," he said, earnestly pleading, "will you let me
make a suggestion?"</p>

<p>The insolent dark eyes ran over him mockingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're the fellow who tried to make a pet out of
Diablo? Well, what's the suggestion?"</p>

<p>"If you wear those spurs you'll drive him mad! Take 'em
off, Mr. Dunbar!"</p>

<p>Dunbar stared at him in amazement, and then looked to
the others. "Did you hear that? This wise one wants me to
try to ride without spurs. Who taught you to ride, eh?"</p>

<p>"I don't know much about it," confessed Bull humbly,
"but I know you're apt to cut him up badly with those big
spurs."</p>

<p>"And what the devil difference does that make to you?"
cried Dunbar with heat. "And what do you mean by all these
fool suggestions? I'm riding the horse!"</p>

<p>Bull drew back, downheaded. Hal Dunbar cast one
contemptuous glance toward him and then stepped to the side
of Diablo. The stallion was quivering and crouching with
fear and anger, and shaking his head from time to time to
get clear of the bandage which blinded him and made him
helpless. Now and then he reared a little and came down
on prancing forefeet, and Bull noted the spring and play
of the fetlock joints. The whole running mechanism of the
horse, indeed, seemed composed of coiled springs. Once
released, what would the result be? And the first hope
entered his mind, the first hope since he had seen the
proud form of Hal Dunbar.</p>

<p>Now the big man set his hand on the pommel and vaulted
into the saddle with a lightness that Bull admired hugely.
Under the impact of that descending bulk the stallion
crouched almost to the earth, but he came up again with a
snort and a strangled neigh of rage.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" called Dunbar, gathering the reins, and
giving the string of his quirt another twist around his
right hand.</p>

<p>One of his men had mounted his horse with a rope, the
noose end of which was around Diablo's neck. This would
serve as a pivot block to keep Diablo running in a circle.
If he tried to run in a straight line the running noose
would stop him and choke him down. He would have to gallop
in a circle for his bucking, and to help keep him in that
circle, the spectators now grouped themselves loosely in a
wide rim. But Bull Hunter did not move. From where he stood
he could see all that he wished.</p>

<p>"All ready!" called the man with the rope.</p>

<p>"Let her go, then!"</p>

<p>The bandage was torn from the eyes of the stallion by
Dunbar's second assistant, and the fellow leaped aside as
he did so. Even then he barely escaped. Diablo had launched
himself in pursuit, and his teeth snapped a fraction of an
inch from the shoulder of the fugitive as the rope came
taut and jerked him aside, and the full weight of Dunbar
was thrown back on the reins.</p>

<p>That mighty wrench of back and shoulder and arm would
have broken the jaw of an ordinary horse; it hardly
disturbed Diablo. His head was first tucked back until his
chin was against his breast, but a moment later he was head
down, bucking as never horse bucked before. One second
earlier Hal Dunbar had seemed almost as powerful as the
animal he rode; now he suddenly became small.</p>

<p>For one thing Diablo wasted no time running against the
rope. He followed the line of least resistance and bolted
around the wide circle with tremendous leaps, gathering
impetus as he ran&mdash;then stopping in mid-career by the
terrific process of hurling himself in the air and coming
down on four stiff legs and with his back humped so that
the rider sat at the uneasy apex of a pyramid. And this was
merely a beginning. That wild category of tricks which Bull
had seen partially unraveled the first time he visited the
horse was now brought forth again, enlarged, improved upon,
made more intricate, intensified. But well and nobly did
Hal Dunbar sustain his fame as a peerless rider. He rode
straight up, and a cheer came from the spectators when they
saw that he was not touching leather in the midst of the
fiercest contortions of Diablo. It seemed that the great
brute would snap the very saddle off his back, but still
the rider sat erect, swaying as though in a storm, but
still firmly glued to the saddle.</p>

<p>Even the heart of Bull Hunter warmed to the battle.
They were a brutally glorious pair as they struggled.
The wrenching hand of the rider and the Spanish bit had
bloodied the mouth of the stallion, the spurs were clinging
horribly at his sides, and he fought back like a mad thing.
He flung himself on the ground, Dunbar barely slipped from
the saddle in time, and whipped onto his feet again, but as
he lurched up, he carried the weight of the rider again,
for Dunbar had leaped into his seat, and as Diablo came up
on all fours, it could be seen that the big man had secured
both stirrups&mdash;the difficult thing in that feature of
the fight. Dunbar urged the stallion on with a yell; and
swinging the quirt over his head, he brought it down with a
stinging cut on the silky flanks of the great horse. Bull
Hunter crouched as though the lash had cut into his own
flesh. He became savage for the moment. He wanted to have
his hands on that rider!</p>

<p>But the cut of the quirt transformed Diablo. If he had
fought hard before, he now fell into a truly demoniacal
frenzy. The long flashing legs were springs indeed, and the
moment his hoofs struck the earth he was flung up again to
a greater height. He was sunfishing now in that most deadly
manner when the horse lands on one forehoof, the rider
receiving a double jar from the down- shock and then the
whiplash snap to the side. Hal Dunbar was no longer using
his quirt. It dangled idly at his side. The joy had gone
from his face. In its place, as shock after shock benumbed
his brain, there was an expression of fierce despair.
Neither was he riding straight up, but he was pulling
leather.</p>

<p>Otherwise, nothing human could have retained a seat in
the saddle for an instant. Diablo, squealing, snorting, and
grunting with effort, was dashing back and forth, flinging
himself aloft, coming down on one stiff leg, doubling back
with jackrabbit agility.</p>

<p>There was no longer applause from the onlookers. Old
Bridewell himself in all of his years had never seen riding
such as this, and it seemed that Diablo at last had met his
master. Never had he fought as he fought now; never had he
been stayed with as he was now. With foam and sweat the
great black was reeking, but never once were the efforts
relaxed. It was too terrible a sight to be applauded.</p>

<p>Then, at the end of a run, instead of hurling himself
into the air as he had usually done before, Diablo flung
himself down and rolled. It caught Dunbar by surprise,
but the yell of horror from the bystanders stimulated him
to sharp action, and he was out of the saddle in the last
hair's breadth of time.</p>

<p>Diablo had been carried on over to his feet by the
impetus of the fall, and he was already rising when
Dunbar leaped for the saddle. Fair and true he struck the
saddle and with marvelous skill his left foot caught the
stirrup and clung to it&mdash;but the right foot missed
its aim, and, before Dunbar could lodge his foot squarely,
the stirrup was dancing crazily as Diablo began a wild
combination of cross-bucking and sunfishing. The hat
snapped from the head of Dunbar and his long black hair
tossed; with both hands he was clinging. All joy of battle
was gone from him. In its place was staring fear, for his
right foot was still out of the stirrup.</p>

<p>"Choke him down! Choke him&mdash;" he shrieked.</p>

<p>Before he could be obeyed by his confused henchmen,
Diablo shot into the air and at the very crest of his rise,
bucked. Dunbar lurched to one side. There was a groan from
the bystanders; and the next instant the stallion, landing
on the one stiffened foreleg, had snapped his rider from
the saddle and hurled him to the ground.</p>

<p>He lay in a shapeless heap, and the stallion whirled to
finish his enemy.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18" name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER 18</h2>

<p class="first">EVERY second of the fight Bull Hunter
had followed the actions of the horse as though he were
directing them from the distance with some electric form of
communication and control. When Hal Dunbar with a yell of
despair was flung sidewise in the saddle as Diablo bucked
in mid-air, Bull Hunter knew what was coming and lurched
through the line of watchers. Straight across the open
space of the circle he raced as he had never run before,
and while the others stood frozen, while the man with the
rope tugged futilely, Bull came in front of the stallion
as Diablo whirled to smash his late rider to a pulp. There
was no question of Dunbar crawling out of the way. He had
rolled on his back with arms outstretched, helplessly
stunned. Even in the lightning speed of the action Bull
found time to wonder what would be the result if the hoof
of the wild horse crashed down into that upturned, handsome
face, now stained with crimson and black with dust.</p>

<p>He had no time to imagine further. Diablo, red-eyed with
anger, had whirled on him and reared, and swerving from
those terrible, pawing hoofs, Bull Hunter leaped in and up.
His goal was not the tossing bridle rein, but the stout
strap which circled the head just above the bit, and his
big right hand jarred home on this goal. All his weight was
behind his stiffened arm, and under the blow the stallion
lurched higher. A down-sweep of a forefoot gashed Bull's
shoulder and tore his shirt to shreds. But he pressed,
expecting every instant the finishing blow on his head. In
he went, with all his weight behind the effort, and felt
the stallion stagger on his hind legs, then topple, lose
balance, and fall with a crash on his side!</p>

<p>Bull followed him in the fall, for half a step, then
whirled, scooped the nerveless body of Hal Dunbar in his
arms, and rushed staggering under the burden to the edge of
the circle. Diablo had regained his footing instantly, but
as he strove to follow, the rope had drawn taut about his
throat, and he was checked.</p>

<p>As for Bull Hunter, he laid the senseless burden down in
safety, and turned toward the stallion. One haunting fear
was in his mind. Had Diablo been sufficiently blinded in
the excitement of the battle to fail to recognize him, or
had the great horse known the hand that toppled it back? In
the latter case Bull Hunter could never come near the black
without peril of his life.</p>

<p>In a gloomy quandary he stared at the trembling, shining
giant, who stood with his head high and his tail flaunting,
and all the fierce pride of victory in his eye. One knot
of people had gathered over the fallen Hal Dunbar, but
some remained, dazed and gaping, looking at the form of
the conqueror. A wild temptation came to Bull to test the
horse even in this crisis of excitement, with every evil
passion roused in him. He stepped out again, his right hand
extended, his voice soft.</p>

<p>"Diablo!"</p>

<p>The stallion jerked his head toward the voice, but the
head was twitched away as the man with the rope brought it
taut again.</p>

<p>"You fool!" he shouted. "Get back, or the hoss'll nail
you!"</p>

<p>Unreasoning rage poured thrilling through Bull Hunter.
He shook his great fist at the other.</p>

<p>"Slack away on that rope or I'll break you in two!"</p>

<p>There was a moment of amazed silence; then, with a
curse, the rider threw the rope on the ground.</p>

<p>"Get your head broke then!"</p>

<p>Bull Hunter had forgotten him already. He had resumed
that approach. At his voice the stallion turned that proud
and terrible head&mdash;with the ears flattened against his
neck. It gave him an ominous, snakelike appearance about
the head, but still Bull went steadily and slowly toward
him with his hand out, that ancient gesture of peace and
good will. There were shouts and warnings from the others.
Hal Dunbar, his senses returned, had staggered to his
feet; he had received no injury in the fall, and now he
gaped in amazement at this empty-handed man approaching
the stallion. And Diablo was no longer controlled by the
rope!</p>

<p>But all the outcries meant nothing to Bull Hunter. They
faded to a blur. All he saw was the head of the stallion.
Had he known and remembered that fall and the hand that
forced him to it? He could not tell. There might be any
murderous intent in that quivering, crouching form.</p>

<p>Just that name, over and over again, very softly,
"Diablo! Steady, Diablo!"</p>

<p>Now he was within two paces&mdash;within a
yard&mdash;his fingers were close to the terrible head and
the ears of Diablo pricked forward.</p>

<p>"Ah, Diablo! They'll never touch you with the spurs
again!"</p>

<p>The stallion made a long step, and with his head raised
he looked over the shoulder of Bull Hunter and snorted
his defiance at all other men in the world! And down
his neck the big, gentle hand was running, soothing his
quivering body, and the steady voice was bringing infinite
messages of reassurance to the troubled brain. That hand
was loosening now the rope which was burning into his
neck&mdash;loosening it, drawing it off. And now the bridle
followed; and Diablo's mouth was free from the cruel taint
of the steel. The head of the stallion turned&mdash;great,
soft eyes looked into the face of Bull Hunter and accepted
him as a friend forever.</p>

<p>Hal Dunbar, groggy from the shock of the fall, staggered
toward them.</p>

<p>"Get away from the horse!" he commanded. "Hey, Riley,
grab Diablo for me again. I'll ride him this time."</p>

<p>He was too unsteady to walk in a straight line, but the
fire of battle was in his eyes again. There was no doubting
the gameness of the big man. Old Bridewell caught his arm
and drew him back.</p>

<p>"If Diablo gets a sniff of you on the wind he'll come at
you like a wolf. Stand back here&mdash;and watch!"</p>

<p>Hal Dunbar was too dazed to resist. Besides, he began
to see that all eyes were focused on the black stallion
and the man beside him. That man was the huge, cloddish
stranger who had advised him to ride without spurs. Then
the full meaning came to Dunbar. The rope was no longer
around the neck of the stallion. The very bridle had been
taken from his head, and yet the stranger stood undaunted
beside him, and the stallion did not seem to be angered by
that nearness.</p>

<p>The next thing Dunbar heard was the voice of Bridewell
saying, "Nerviest thing I ever seen. I been putting this
Bull Hunter down for a half-wit, pretty near. All his
strength in his back and none in his head. But I changed my
mind today. When you hit the ground, Diablo whirled on you,
and he'd of smashed you to bits before they could choke him
down and pull him away, but Bull came out of the crowd on
the run, grabbed the bridle, made Diablo rear, took that
cut on his shoulder, and threw him fair and square. Finest,
coolest, headiest thing I ever seen done with a hoss in a
pinch. And he saved your skin, Dunbar. You'd be a mess this
minute, if it wasn't for Hunter! He threw Diablo and turned
around and picked you up as if you was a baby and packed
you over here. Then he went back&mdash;and you see what's
he's doing?"</p>

<p>"He saved my life?" muttered Dunbar. "That big&mdash;He
saved my life?"</p>

<p>Gratitude, for the moment at least, was obscured in his
mind. All he felt vividly was a burning shame. He, Hal
Dunbar, the invincible, had been beaten fairly and squarely
in the battle with the horse; not only this, he had been
saved from complete destruction only by the intervention of
this nonentity, this Bull Hunter whom he had scorned only
a few moments before. He looked about him in blind anger
at the bystanders. Worst of all, this was a new country
where he was only vaguely known, and whenever his name was
mentioned in these parts in the future, there would be
someone to tell of the superior prowess of Hunter, and how
the life of Dunbar was thrown away and saved by another. No
wonder that big Hal Dunbar writhed with the shame of it.</p>

<p>He forgot even that emotion now in wonder at what was
happening. Hunter had stepped to the side of the horse,
raised his foot, and put it in the stirrup. Did the fool
intend to climb into the saddle while that black devil was
not blindfolded, without even a bridle?</p>

<p>That, in fact, was what he was doing. The steady murmur
of the voice of Hunter reached him as the big man soothed
the horse. He saw the head of Diablo turn, saw him sniff
the shoulder of his companion, and then Hunter lifted
himself slowly into the saddle. There was a groan of
excitement from the spectators, and at the sound rather
than at the weight of his back, Diablo crouched. It was
only for a moment that he quivered, wild-eyed, irresolute.
Then he straightened and threw up his head. Bull Hunter,
his face white and drawn but his mouth resolute, had
touched the shining flank of the stallion, and Diablo moved
into a soft trot, gentle as the flowing of water.</p>

<p>Before him the circle split and rolled back. He glided
through, guided by a hand that touched lightly on his neck,
and in an utter silence he was seen to turn the corner
of the nearest shed and approach the corral. Hal Dunbar,
rubbing his eyes, was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"A trick horse!" he said. "By the Lord, a trick
horse!"</p>

<p>"The first time I ever seen him play that trick," gasped
old Bridewell, his eyes huge and round, "except when Tod
was up on him. I dunno what's happened. It's like a dream.
But there's a saddle on him now, and that was something
even Tod could never make him stand. I dunno what's
happened!"</p>

<p>The little crowd broke up into chattering groups. Here
had been a thing that would bear telling and retelling
for many a year. In the confusion Dunbar's man, Riley,
approached his employer.</p>

<p>Both gratitude and shame were forgotten by Dunbar now.
He gripped the shoulder of this man and groaned, "I've lost
him, Riley! The only horse ever foaled that could have
carried me the way a man should be carried. Now I'll have
to ride plow horses the rest of my life!"</p>

<p>He pointed to the cloddish, heavy-limbed gray which he
had ridden in his quest for the superhorse at the Bridewell
place.</p>

<p>"I been thinking," said Riley. "I been thinking a pile
the last few minutes."</p>

<p>"What you been thinking about? What good does thinking
do me? I've lost the horse, haven't I, and that half-wit
has him?"</p>

<p>"He has him&mdash;now," suggested Riley, watching the
face of the big man for fear that he might go too far.</p>

<p>"You mean by that?" queried the master.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Riley. "Because he has the black now,
it doesn't mean that he's going to have him forever, does
it?"</p>

<p>"Riley, you're a devil. That fellow saved my life, they
tell me."</p>

<p>"I don't mean you're going to bump him off. But suppose
you get him to come and work on your place? There might be
ways of getting the hoss&mdash; buying him or something.
Get him there, and we'll find a way. Besides, he can teach
you how to handle the hoss before you get him. I say it's
all turned out for the best."</p>

<p>Dunbar frowned. "Take him with me? And every place I go
I hear it said, 'There's the man who rode the horse that
threw Dunbar!' No, curse him, I'll see him in Hades before
I take him with me!"</p>

<p>"How else are you going to get the hoss? Tell me
that?"</p>

<p>"That's it," muttered Dunbar. "I've got to have him.
I've got to have him! Did you watch? I felt as if the big
black devil had wings."</p>

<p>"He had you in the air most of the time, all right," and
Riley grinned.</p>

<p>"Shut up," snapped his master. "But the chief thing is,
I want to show that big black fiend that I'm his master.
He&mdash;he's beaten me once. But one beating doesn't
finish me!"</p>

<p>"Then go get Hunter to come with us when we ride
back."</p>

<p>Dunbar hesitated another instant and then nodded. "It
has to be done."</p>

<p>He strode off in pursuit of Bull and presently found
the big man in the corral rubbing down the stallion; the
little bright-eyed Tod was close beside them. It had been a
great day for Tod. First he had felt that his giant pupil
was disgraced&mdash;a man without spirit. And then, in the
time of blackest doubt, Bull Hunter had become a hero and
accomplished the great feat&mdash; ridden Diablo, before
all the incredulous eyes of the watchers. All of Tod's
own efforts had been repaid a thousandfold when he heard
Bull say to one of those who followed with questions and
admiration, "It's not my work. Tod showed me how to go
about it. Tod deserves the credit."</p>

<p>That was the reason that Tod's eyes now were supernally
bright when big Hal Dunbar approached. Diablo showed signs
of excitement, but Charlie Hunter quieted him with a word
and went to the bars of the corral. The hand of Dunbar was
stretched out, and Bull took it with humble earnestness.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you weren't hurt bad," he said. "For a minute
or two I was scared that Diablo&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," cut in Dunbar, for he detested a new
description of the scene of his failure. Then he made
himself smile. "But I've come to thank you for what you
did, Hunter. Between you and me, I know that I talked
rather sharp to you a while back. I'm sorry for that. And
now&mdash;why, man, your side must be wounded!"</p>

<p>"It's just a little scratch," said Bull good-naturedly.
"It isn't the first time that Diablo has made me bleed but
now&mdash;well, isn't he worth a fight, Mr. Dunbar?"</p>

<p>And he gestured to the magnificent, watchful head of the
stallion. The heart of Hal Dunbar swelled in him. By fair
means or foul, he must have that horse, and on the spot he
made his proposition to Hunter. He had only to climb on
the back of Diablo and ride south with him; the pay would
be anything &mdash;double what he got from Bridewell, who,
besides, was almost through with him, Dunbar understood.</p>

<p>"But I'm not much good," and Bull sighed reluctantly. "I
can't use a rope, and I don't know cattle, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll find uses for you. Will you come?"</p>

<p>So it was settled. But before Bull climbed into the
saddle and started off after Dunbar, little Tod drew him to
one side.</p>

<p>"There ain't any good in Dunbar. Watch him
and&mdash;remember me, Bull."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19" name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER 19</h2>

<p class="first">THAT ride to the southern mountains seemed
to Bull Hunter to mark a great point of departure between
his old life and a new life.</p>

<p>He had not heard Riley, fox-faced and wicked of eye,
say to his master, "What this big fool needs is a little
kidding. Make him think that we figure him to be a big
gun." He had not seen Hal Dunbar make a wry face before he
nodded.</p>

<p>All that Bull Hunter could know was that the three
men&mdash;Riley, Dunbar, and Joe Castor&mdash;were all
exceedingly pleasant to him on the way. Of all the men in
the world, only Pete Reeve had treated him as these men
were now doing, and it was sweet beyond measure to Bull
Hunter to be treated with considerate respect, to have his
opinion asked, to be deferred to and flattered. As for the
thousand little asides with which they made a mock of him,
they were far above his head. It seemed only patent to Bull
Hunter that he had been accepted freely into the equal
society of men.</p>

<p>He drew a vague comparison between that success and
his mastery of Diablo. The big stallion was like a kitten
under his hand. It required much coaxing during the
first half-day of riding to bring Diablo within speaking
distance of the other men, but gradually he discovered that
they could do him no harm so long as the gentle voice of
Hunter was near him; thereafter he was entirely amenable
to reason. One could see that the stallion was learning
difficult lessons, but he was learning them fast. Eye and
ear and scent told him that these creatures were dangerous.
Old experience told him that they were dangerous, and only
a blind trust in Bull Hunter enabled him to conquer the
panic which surged up in his brain time and again. But he
kept on trying, and the constant struggle against men which
had featured his life made him astonishingly quick to pick
up new facts. The first step had been the hard one, and it
seemed to Bull Hunter that the close-knit, smooth-flowing
muscles beneath him were carrying him onward into the
esteem of all men. To Diablo he gave the praise, and after
Diablo to little freckled Tod, and to Pete Reeve, the
fighter. As for taking any credit for himself, that idea
never came to him for a moment.</p>

<p>The long trip took two days. They crossed the green,
rolling hills; they passed the foothills, and climbing
steadily they came onto a broad, high plateau&mdash;it was
a natural kingdom, this ranch of the Dunbars. The fence
around it was the continuous range of mountains skirting
the plateau on all sides, and in every direction up to
those blue summits as far as the eye carried, stretched
the land which owned Hal Dunbar as master. To Bull Hunter,
when they reached the crest, and the broad domain was
pointed out to him, this seemed a princely stretch indeed,
and Hal Dunbar was more like a king than ever. It was easy
to forgive pride in such a man and a certain asperity
of temper. How could so rich and powerful a man be like
others?</p>

<p>The ranch house was worthy of such a holding. A
heavy growth of beautiful silver spruce swept up the
slope of some hills, and riding through the forest, one
caught the first glimpse of the building. It was spread
out carelessly, the foundations laid deep to cover the
irregularities of the ground. It was a heterogeneous mass,
obviously not the work of any one builder. Here a one-story
wing rambled far to the side, built heavily, of logs rudely
squared, and there was a three-story frame section of the
house; and still again there was a tall tower effect of
rough stone. As for the barns and sheds which swept away
down the farther and lower slopes, the meanest of them
looked to Bull as though it might have made a home of more
than average comfort.</p>

<p>The three other riders noted the gaping astonishment of
Bull and passed the wink quietly around. To Hal Dunbar it
was growing more and more annoying that he had to trouble
himself with such a clod of a man and use diplomacy where
contemptuous force would have been so much more after his
heart. But he continued to follow the scheme first laid
down for his pursuit by clever Riley, and when they came to
the wide-ranging stable he assigned the black stallion to a
roomy box stall. Bull Hunter thanked him for the courtesy
as though it had been a direct personal favor; as a matter
of fact, Hal felt that he was merely taking care of a horse
which was already as good as his.</p>

<p>Coming back toward the house Bull walked slowly in the
rear of the little party. He wanted to take plenty of time
and drink in the astonishing details of what to him was
a palace. And about the weather-beaten old house he felt
that there was a touch of mystery of a more or less feudal
romance. Climbing the steps to the porch he turned; a broad
sweep of hills opened above the tops of the spruces, and
the blue mountains were piled beyond.</p>

<p>While he stood, a door slammed, and he heard a girl's
mellow voice calling, "Hello, Hal, what luck?"</p>

<p>"What luck? No luck!" grumbled young Dunbar. "All the
luck has gone the way of my friend here." He brought out
the last words jokingly. "This is Charlie Hunter, commonly
called Bull for reasons you may guess. Bull, this is Mary
Hood."</p>

<p>Bull had turned lumberingly, and he found himself
staring at a girl in a more formal riding outfit than he
had ever seen before, with tall boots of soft red leather,
and a little round black hat set on her hair, and a coat
fitted somewhat closely. The rather masculine outfit
only served to make her freer, more independent, more
delightfully herself, Bull Hunter thought. She looked him
up and down and reserved judgment, it seemed.</p>

<p>"He rode Diablo," Dunbar was explaining.</p>

<p>"And that's why you brought him?" she asked, flashing a
queer glance at Hal.</p>

<p>Then she came a pace down the steps and shook hands with
Bull. He took the small hand carefully, with a fear that
the bones would break unless he were excessively gentle.
At last she laughed so frankly that a tingle went through
his big body, and he peered closely at her. As a rule
the laughter of others made him hot with shame, but this
laughter was different; it seemed to invite him into a
pleasant secret.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to meet the man who conquered Diablo," she was
saying.</p>

<p>"I didn't beat Diablo," he hastened to explain. "We just
sort of reached an understanding. He saw that I didn't mean
him any harm&mdash;so he let me ride him. That's all there
was to it!"</p>

<p>He saw her eyes narrow a trifle as she looked down at
him, for she had drawn back to the level of the porch. Was
she despising him and condemning him merely because he had
told her the truth? He flushed at the thought, and then he
was called into the house by Dunbar and brought to a room.
The size of it inspired him with a profound awe, and he was
still gaping when Dunbar left him.</p>

<p>In the hall the master of the house met Riley, and the
fox-faced lieutenant drew him aside.</p>

<p>"I've got a plan," he said.</p>

<p>"You're full of plans," muttered Dunbar evilly.</p>

<p>All the way home he had been striving to find some way
of explaining his lack of success with the stallion to
Mary Hood. She had grown up on the ranch with him, for her
father had been the manager of the ranch for twenty years;
and she had grown up with the feeling that Hal Dunbar was
infallible and invincible.</p>

<p>"Did you see the big hulk look at Mary Hood?" Riley
asked.</p>

<p>The name came pat with the unpleasant part of Hal's
brooding, and his scowl grew blacker. "What about it?"</p>

<p>"Looked at her as though she was an angel&mdash;touched
her hand as though it was fire. I tell you, Hal, she
knocked Hunter clean off his balance."</p>

<p>"Not the first she's done that to," said Hal with
meaning.</p>

<p>"Maybe not. Maybe not," said Riley rather hastily. "But
I been thinking. Suppose you go to Mary and tell her that
you're dead set on keeping this Hunter with you. Tell her
that he's a hard fellow to handle, that he likes her, and
that the best way to make sure of him is for her to be
nice to him. She can do that easy. She takes nacheral to
flirting."</p>

<p>"Flirt with that thick-head? She'd laugh in my face."</p>

<p>"She'd do more than that for you, Hal."</p>

<p>"H'm," grunted Dunbar, greatly mollified. "I ask her
to make Hunter happy. What comes of it? If her father
sees Hunter make eyes at her he'll blow the head off the
clodhopper."</p>

<p>"I know." Riley nodded. "He's always afraid she'll
take a fancy to one of the hands and run off with him, or
something like that. He's dead set agin' her saying two
words to anybody like me, say!"</p>

<p>He gritted his teeth and flushed at the thought. Then he
continued. "But that's just what you want. You want to get
Hunter's head blown off, don't you?"</p>

<p>Dunbar caught the shoulder of Riley and whirled him
around.</p>

<p>"Are you talking murder to me, Riley?"</p>

<p>"I'm talking sense," said Riley.</p>

<p>"By the Lord," growled Dunbar, "you're a plain bad one,
Riley. You like deviltry for the sake of the deviltry
itself. You want me to get&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How much do you want the black hoss, chief?" Dunbar
sighed.</p>

<p>"You can't touch him, after him saving your life, and I
can't touch him, because everybody knows that I'm your man.
But suppose you get the girl and Hunter planted? Then when
Jack Hood rides in this afternoon, I'll take him where he
can see 'em together. Leave the rest to me. Will you? I'll
have Jack Hood scared she's going to elope before morning,
and Jack will do the rest. You know his way."</p>

<p>"Suppose Hood gets killed?"</p>

<p>"Killed&mdash;by that? Jack Hood? Why, you know he's
near as good as you with his gat!"</p>

<p>Dunbar nodded slowly. After all, the scheme was a simple
one.</p>

<p>"Well?" whispered Riley.</p>

<p>"You and the devil win," said Hal. "After all, what's
this Hunter amount to? Nothing. And I need the horse!"</p>

<p>He executed the first step of the scheme instantly. He
went downstairs and found the girl still on the veranda.
She began to mock him at once.</p>

<p>"You'll go to heaven, Hal, giving a home to the man who
beats you."</p>

<p>He managed to smile, although the words were poison
to him. He had loved her as long as he could remember,
and sooner or later she would be his wife, but the period
remained indefinitely in the future as the whims of the
girl changed. It was for that reason, as Hal very well
knew, that her father became furious when she smiled at
another man. The rich marriage was his goal; and when a
second man stepped onto the stage, old Jack Hood was ready
to fight. Hal saw a way of stopping her gibes and proving
his good intentions toward Hunter all in a breath.</p>

<p>"He saved my life, Mary. I lost a stirrup, and the devil
of a horse threw me."</p>

<p>Briefly he sketched in the story of the rescue, and how
Bull Hunter afterward had ridden the horse without spurs,
without a bridle. Before he ended her eyes were shining.</p>

<p>"That's what he meant when he said he hadn't beaten
Diablo. I understand now. At the time I thought he was a
little simple, Hal."</p>

<p>"He's not exceptionally clever, Mary," said Hal, "and
that's where the point comes in of what I want you to
do. Hunter is apt to take a fancy that he isn't wanted
here&mdash;that he's being kept out of charity because he
saved my life. Nothing I can say will convince him. I want
you to give him a better reason for staying around. Will
you do it&mdash;as a great favor?"</p>

<p>She dropped her chin into her hand and studied him.</p>

<p>"Just what are you driving at, Hal?"</p>

<p>"You know what I mean well enough. I want you to waste a
smile or two on him, Mary. Will you do that? Make him think
you like him a good deal, that you're glad to have him
around. Will you? Take him out for a walk this afternoon
and get him to tell you the story of his life. You can
always make a man talk and generally you turn them into
fools. You've done it with me, often enough," he added
gloomily.</p>

<p>"Flirt with that big, quiet fellow?" she said gravely.
"Hal, you're criminal. Besides, you know that I don't
flirt. It's just the opposite. When I like a man I'm simply
frank about it."</p>

<p>"But you have a way of being frank so that a poor devil
usually thinks you want to marry him, and then there's the
devil to pay. You know it perfectly well."</p>

<p>"That's not true, Hal!"</p>

<p>"I won't argue. But will you do it?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely not!"</p>

<p>"It might be quite a game. He may not be altogether a
fool. And suppose he were to wake up? Suppose he's simply
half-asleep?"</p>

<p>He saw a gleam of excitement come in her eyes and wisely
left her without another word. After things had reached a
certain point Mary could be generally trusted to carry the
action on.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch20" name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER 20</h2>

<p class="first">JACK HOOD had ridden out on his rounds
with a new horse that morning, and the new horse developed
the gait of a plow horse. The result was that grim old Jack
reached the house that night with a body racked by the
labor of the day and a disposition poisoned for the entire
evening. He was met at the stable by Riley, and the sight
of him brought a spark for the moment into the eye of the
foreman.</p>

<p>"You're back, then, and you got Diablo?"</p>

<p>"Look yonder."</p>

<p>Jack Hood went to the box stall and came back rubbing
his hands, but his exultation was cut short by Riley's
remark. "He doesn't belong to Hal. Hal was thrown and
another gent rode him."</p>

<p>The amazement of Jack Hood took the shape of a wild
torrent of profanity. He was proud of the ranch which
he had controlled for so long, and still prouder of his
young master. His creed included two main points&mdash;the
essential beauty of his daughter and the infallibility of
young Hal Dunbar; consequently his great ambition was to
unite the two.</p>

<p>"Mary took to Hunter pretty kindly," concluded Riley, as
they walked back toward the house at the conclusion of the
story.</p>

<p>The foreman took off his hat and shook back his long,
iron-gray hair.</p>

<p>"Trust her for that. Something new is always what she
wants."</p>

<p>"They've got the new well pretty near sunk," said Riley.
"Take a look at it?"</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>But before they had gone halfway down the path onto
which Riley had cunningly diverted the older man, he caught
Hood's arm and stopped him with a whisper.</p>

<p>"Look at that. <i>Already!</i> This Hunter ain't such a slow
worker, eh, Jack?"</p>

<p>They had come in view of the little terraced garden
which was Mary's particular property; it was screened from
the house by a rank or two of the spruce, and on a rustic
bench, seated with their backs to the witnesses, were Mary
and Bull Hunter. The girl was rapt in attention, and her
eyes never left the face of Hunter. As for Bull, he was
talking steadily, and it seemed to Jack Hood that as the
big stranger talked he leaned closer and closer to the
girl. The hint which Riley had already dropped was enough
to inflame the imagination of the suspicious foreman; what
he now saw was totally conclusive, he thought. Now, under
his very eyes, he saw the big man stretch out his hand, and
he saw the hand of Mary dropped into it.</p>

<p>It was more than Riley had dared to hope for. He caught
Jack Hood by the shoulders, and whirled him around, and
half dragged him back to the house.</p>

<p>"Not in front of your daughter, Jack," he pleaded. "I
don't blame you for being mad when a skunk like that starts
flirting with a girl the first day he's seen her. But if
you got anything to say to him, wait till Mary is out of
the way. There goes the supper bell. Hurry on in. Keep hold
on yourself."</p>

<p>"Do I have to sit through supper and look at that
hound?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," suggested the cunning Riley. "Have a bite
in the kitchen and go up to your room. I'll say that you
got some figures to run over. Afterward, you can come down
and jump him!"</p>

<p>He watched Jack Hood disappear, grinning faintly, and
then hunted for Hal Dunbar.</p>

<p>"It's started," he said. "I dropped a word in Jack's ear
and then showed him the two of 'em sitting together. It was
like a spark in the powder. The old boy exploded."</p>

<p>"How close were they sitting?" asked Hal
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Close enough." Riley grinned, for he was not averse to
making even Dunbar himself writhe.</p>

<p>The result was that Hal maneuvered to draw Mary Hood
aside when she came in with big Hunter for supper.
Something in Bull Hunter's face disturbed the owner of the
ranch, for the eyes of Bull were alight, and he was smiling
for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>"How did things go?" he asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"You were all wrong about him," said the girl earnestly.
"He's not a half- wit by any means, Hal. I had a hard time
of it at first, but then I got him talking about Diablo
and the trouble ended. Not a bit of sentiment in him; but
just like a great big, simple, honest boy, with a man's
strength. It would have done you good to hear him!"</p>

<p>"And he'll stay with us?" asked Hal dryly, for he was
far from enthusiastic.</p>

<p>"Of course he'll stay. Do you know what he did? He
promised to try to teach me to ride Diablo, and he even
shook hands on it! Hal, I like him immensely!"</p>

<p>All during the meal the glances of Hal Dunbar alternated
between the girl and the giant. He was more disturbed than
he dared to confess even to himself. It was not so much
that Bull Hunter sat with a faintly dreamy smile, staring
into the future and forgetting his food, but it was the
fact that Mary Hood was continually smiling across the
table into that big, calm face. Dunbar began to feel that
the devil was indeed behind the wit of Riley.</p>

<p>He began to wait nervously for the coming of the girl's
father and the explosion. As soon as supper was over,
following the time-honored custom which the first Dunbar
established on the ranch, Mary left the room, and the men
gathered in groups for cards or dice or talk, for they were
not ordinary hired hands, but picked men. Many of them had
grown gray in the Dunbar service. Now was the time for the
coming of Jack Hood, and Hal had not long to wait.</p>

<p>The door at the far side of the big room was thrown open
not five minutes after the disappearance of Mary Hood,
and her father entered. He came with a brow as black as
night, tossed a sharp word here and there in reply to the
greetings, and going to the fireplace leaned against the
mantel and rolled a cigarette. While he smoked, from under
his shaggy brows he looked over the company.</p>

<p>Hal Dunbar waited, holding his breath. One brilliant
picture was dawning on his mind&mdash;himself mounted
on great black Diablo and swinging over the hills at a
matchless gallop.</p>

<p>The picture vanished. Jack Hood had left the fireplace
and was crossing the room with his alert, quick step. His
nerves showed in that step; and it was nerve power that
made him a dreaded gunfighter. His gloom seemed to have
vanished now. He smiled here; he paused there for a cheery
word; and so he came to where Bull Hunter sat with his long
legs stretched before him and the unchanging, dreamy smile
on his face.</p>

<p>Over those long legs Jack Hood stumbled. When he whirled
on the seated man his cheer was gone and a devil was in his
face.</p>

<p>"You damned lummox," he said, "what d'ye mean by
tripping me?"</p>

<p>"Me?" gasped Bull, the smile gradually fading and blank
amazement taking its place.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that a man stepped out of the
shadow of the kitchen doorway, a very small withered man.
No doubt he was some late arrival asking hospitality for
the night; and having come after supper was over, he had
been fed in the kitchen and then sent in among the other
men; for no one was turned away hungry from the Dunbar
house. He was so small, so light-footed, that he would
hardly have been noticed at any time, and now that the roar
from Jack Hood had focused all eyes on Bull Hunter, the
newcomer was entirely overlooked. He seemed to make it a
point to withdraw himself farther, for now he stepped into
a dense shadow near the wall where he could see and remain
unseen.</p>

<p>Jack Hood had shaken his fist under the nose of the
seated giant.</p>

<p>"I meant it," he cried. "You tripped me, you skunk, and
Jack Hood ain't old enough to take that from no man!"</p>

<p>Bull Hunter cast out deprecatory hands. The words of
this fire-eyed fellow were bad enough, but the tigerish
tenseness of his muscles was still worse. It meant battle,
and the long, black, leather holster at the thigh of Hood
meant battle of only one kind. It had come so suddenly on
him that Bull Hunter was dazed.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said. "I sure didn't mean to trip
you&mdash;but maybe my foot might of slipped out a little
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Slipped out!" sneered Hood. He stopped, panting with
fury. That a comparative stranger should have dared to
speak familiarly with his daughter was bad enough; that a
blank-faced coward should have dared flirt with her, dared
take her hand, was maddening.</p>

<p>"You infernal sneak!" he growled. "Are you going to try
to get out of it, now that you've seen you can't bluff me
down&mdash;that I won't stand for your tricks?"</p>

<p>Bull Hunter rose, slowly, unfolding his great bulk until
he towered above the other; and yet the condensed activity
of Hood was fully as formidable. There were pantherlike
suggestions of speed about the arm that dangled beside his
holster.</p>

<p>The withered little man in the shadow by the kitchen
door took one noiseless step into the light&mdash;and then
shrank back as though he had changed his mind.</p>

<p>"It looks to me," said Bull Hunter mildly, "that you're
trying to force a fight on me. Stranger, I can't fight a
man as old as you are."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a tactless speech, but Bull was too dazed
to think of grace in words. It brought a murderous snarl
from the other.</p>

<p>"I'm old enough to be Jack Hood&mdash;maybe you've heard
of me? And I'm young enough to polish off every unlicked
cub in these parts. Now, curse you, what d'ye say to
that?"</p>

<p>"I can only say," said Bull miserably, feeling his way,
"that I don't want to fight."</p>

<p>With an oath Hood exclaimed, "A coward! They're all like
that&mdash; every one of the big fellers. A yaller-hearted
sneak!"</p>

<p>"Easy, Jack!" broke in one of the men.</p>

<p>"Let Jack alone," called the commanding voice of Hal
Dunbar. "I saw Hunter trip him!"</p>

<p>"But," pleaded Bull Hunter, "I give you my
word&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up! I've heard enough of your talk."</p>

<p>Bull Hunter obediently stopped his talk.</p>

<p>A sickening quiet drew through the room. Men bowed their
heads or turned them away, for such cowardice was not
pleasant to see. The little man in the shadow raised one
hand and brushed it across his face.</p>

<p>"I'll let you off one way," said Jack Hood. "Stand up
here, and face the crowd and tell 'em you're a liar, that
you're sorry for what you done!"</p>

<p>Bull faced the crowd. A shudder of expectancy went
through them, and then they saw that his face was working,
not with shame or fear but with a mental struggle, and then
he spoke.</p>

<p>"Gents, it seems like I may be wrong. I may have tripped
him which I didn't mean to. But not knowing that I tripped
him, I got to say that I can't call myself a liar. I can't
apologize."</p>

<p>They were shocked into a new attention; they saw him
turn and face the frown of Jack Hood.</p>

<p>"You're forcing this fight, stranger. And, if you keep
on, you'll drop, sir. I promise you that!"</p>

<p>The sudden change in affairs had astonished Jack Hood;
now his astonishment gave way to a sort of hungry joy.</p>

<p>"I never was strong on words. I got two ways of talking
and here's the one I like best!" As he uttered the last
word he reached for his gun.</p>

<p>The little man glided out of the shadow, crouched,
intense. It seemed to him that the hand of Bull Hunter
hung motionless at his side while the gun flashed out from
Hood's holster. He groaned at the thought, but in the last
second, there was a move of Hunter's hand that no eye could
follow, that singular convulsive twitch which Pete Reeve
had taught him so long before. Only one gun spoke. Jack
Hood spun sidewise and crashed to the floor, and his gun
rattled far away.</p>

<p>By the time the first man had rushed to the fallen
figure, the gun was back in Bull's holster.</p>

<p>The little man in the shadow heard him saying,
"Pardners, he's not dead. He's shot through the right
shoulder, low, beneath the joint. That bullet won't kill
him, but get him bandaged quick!"</p>

<p>A calm, clear voice, it rang through the room. The
little man slipped back into his shadow, and straightened
against the wall.</p>

<p>"He's right," said Hal Dunbar, stepping back from the
cluster. "Riley and Jerry, get him up to his room and
bandage him, quick! The rest of you stay here. We got a
job. Hood's gun hung in the holster, and this fellow shot
him down. A murdering, cowardly thing to do. You hear? A
murdering, cowardly thing to do!"</p>

<p>Obviously he was wrong, and obviously not one of his
henchmen would tell him so. For some reason the boss
intended to take up the lost battle of Jack Hood. Why, was
not theirs to reason, though plainly the fight had been
fair, and Hood had been in the wrong from the first. They
shifted swiftly, a man to each door, the others along the
wall with their hands on their weapons. There was a change
in Bull Hunter. One long leap backward carried him into a
corner of the room. He stood erect, and they could see his
eyes gleaming in the shadow.</p>

<p>"I think you got me here to trap me, Dunbar," he called
in such a voice that the little man in the shadow thrilled
at the sound of it, "but you'll find that you're trapped
first, my friend. Touch that gun of yours, and you're a
dead man, Dunbar. Curse you, I dare you to go for it!"</p>

<p>Could this be Bull Hunter speaking? The little man in
the shadow thrilled with joyous amazement.</p>

<p>Hal Dunbar evidently was going to fight the thing
through. He stood swaying a little from side to side. "No
guns out, boys, as yet. Wait till I take my crack at him,
and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>The little man in the shadow stepped out into the light
and walked calmly toward the center of the room.</p>

<p>"Just a little wee minute, Dunbar," he was saying. "Just
a little wee minute, Mr. Man-trapper Dunbar! I got a word
to say."</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you?" cried Hal Dunbar, turning on
this puny stranger.</p>

<p>A joyous shout from Bull Hunter drowned the answer of
the other.</p>

<p>"Pete! Pete Reeve!"</p>

<p>The little man waved his hand carelessly to the giant in
the corner.</p>

<p>"You give me a hard trail, Bull, old boy. But you didn't
think you could slip me, did you? Not much. And here I
am, pretty pronto on the dot, I figure." He took in with
a glance the men along the walls. "You know me, boys, and
I'm here to see fair play. They ain't going to be fair play
in this room with you boys lined up waiting to drop Bull
in case he plugs Dunbar. Dunbar, I know you. And between
you and me, I don't know no good of you. You're young, but
you're going to show later on. If you want to talk business
to Bull Hunter some other time, you're welcome to come
finding him, and he won't be hard to find. Bull, come along
with me. Just back up, if you don't mind, Bull. Because
they's murder in our friend Dunbar's face. And here we
are!"</p>

<p>Side by side they drew back to the outer door with big
Hal Dunbar watching them from under a scowl, with never a
word, and so through the door and into the night.</p>

<p>Two minutes later Diablo was rocking across the hills
with his mighty stride, and the cow pony of Pete Reeve was
pattering beside him.</p>

<p>As they drove through the great spruces the moon rose.
Bull Hunter greeted it with a thundering song and threw up
his hands to it.</p>

<p>Pete Reeve swore softly in amazement and drew his horse
to a walk.</p>

<p>"By the Lord," cried Bull, "and I haven't thanked you
yet for pulling me out of that mess. I'd be crow's food by
this time if it hadn't been for you, Pete!"</p>

<p>"That only wipes out one score. Let's talk about you,
Bull. Since I last seen you, you've got to be a man. Was it
dropping Hood that made you buck up like this?"</p>

<p>"That old man?"</p>

<p>"That old man," snorted Pete, "is Jack Hood, one of the
best of 'em with a gun. But if it wasn't the fight that
made you feel your oats, was it breaking Diablo?"</p>

<p>"No breaking to it. We just got acquainted."</p>

<p>"But what's happened? What's wakened you, Bull?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," said Bull and became thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Pete," he said, after a long time, "have you ever
noticed a sort of chill that gets inside you when the right
sort of a girl smiles and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The devil," murmured Pete Reeve, "it's the girl
that's happened to you, eh? You forget her, Bull. I'm
going to take you on the trail with me and keep you from
thinking. It's a new trail for me, Bull. It's a trail where
I'm going straight, I can't take you with me while I'm
playing against the law. So I'm going to stay inside the
law&mdash;with you."</p>

<p>"Maybe," and Bull Hunter sighed. "But no matter how far
the trail leads, I'm thinking that some day I'll ride in
a circle and come back to this place where we started out
together."</p>

<p>He turned in the saddle.</p>

<p>The outline of the Dunbar house was fading into the
night.</p>
