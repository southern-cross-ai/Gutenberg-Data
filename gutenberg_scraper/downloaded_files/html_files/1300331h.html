  <h2>CHAPTER ONE</h2>

  <p class="first">BOMBAY sweltered. The police commissioner's dim-lit library
  was stifling in spite of electric fans. The night's humidity, the length of a
  garden, and two streets deadened the clang of tramcars; but there was a
  rumbling undertone of indrawn rancor. There had been a three-day pause,
  brooding between riots; passion, momentarily exhausted, redistilled itself at
  ninety in the shade. But the watch kept. Police headquarters are where the
  commissioner is at the end of a telephone. He clicked back the phone on its
  rest and wiped his forehead; a gray man, with a rather close-clipped gray
  mustache and heavy eye-brows over his dark and deep-sunken eyes.</p>

  <p>Blair Warrender took the chair opposite and eased his long legs under the
  table. He was a much younger man, not scared of the commissioner but not
  quite at ease. The commissioner was an irritating enigma&mdash;he was
  sometimes genial, equally often sardonic. He expected his subordinates to
  work in the dark and take the blame for accidents. He had a better than usual
  record for blaming or praising the right man, but he trusted subordinates,
  according to their view of it, too much or not enough.</p>

  <p>He almost never trusted one individual with all the facts of a case. When
  he called a man by his first name, it might indicate confidence, or it might
  reveal familiarity that borders on contempt; there was no knowing which. But
  no one, least of all Blair Warrender, doubted his ability or dreamed of
  disobeying his orders.</p>

  <p>There was a rather new scar on his chin, but nothing very noticeable about
  Blair Warrender except his eyes. They smoldered. They made some women hate
  him at sight. Other, wiser women, recognized controlled and consequently
  deadly anger; some took sporting chances with it. Wiser women yet sought his
  friendship, dangerous in one sense though it might be. Men found him easy to
  work with, if rather exacting. He was very neat in a new uniform that he
  could ill afford: his other one had been torn off his back by Hindus. In the
  course of routine duty he had saved some of them from being scragged by
  Moslems, and they had therefore accused him of racial prejudices along with
  more unmentionable faults: but he was used to that and exasperatingly
  unresentful.</p>

  <p>The table was near one end of the room, where the shaded electric light
  made the Bokhara hanging look like a blood-stained arras. At the other end of
  the room, near the door, stood a turbaned servant who had rather Mongolian
  eyes: when the commissioner, with a cigar in one side of his mouth, grumbled
  indistinctly and in a low voice that it was the hottest night in ten years,
  the servant examined the switch of the electric fan. So the commissioner
  pitched his voice still lower.</p>

  <p>"Read this."</p>

  <p>He handed Blair Warrender a London daily paper ten days old, blue-penciled
  at a headline in heavy type:</p>

  <p>class="headline" INDIA: BRITISH OFFICER MYSTERIOUSLY MISSING. RUMORED
  VICTIM OF TERRORISTS. OFFICIAL SILENCE.</p>

  <p>Blair Warrender read the paragraph&mdash;frowned&mdash; passed the paper
  back.</p>

  <p>"Frensham," he said, "has been missing for months. According to the League
  of Nations report about a hundred thousand people vanish every year without
  trace. The mystery is that the papers didn't learn of this sooner. I suppose
  this means trouble."</p>

  <p>"For you, yes. You find Frensham." The commissioner folded the newspaper,
  laid it on some other documents and slipped an elastic band over the lot.
  Then he handed a file of reports across the table. "I need you like the devil
  here in Bombay, but"&mdash;he paused perceptibly, with his eyes on the
  servant over by the door&mdash;"you are to take this case and find Frensham
  dead or alive."</p>

  <p>Blair Warrender scowled over the file, turning the papers and idly
  refreshing memory.</p>

  <p>"Nothing new here, sir. We knew all this before Frensham was three days
  massing? On leave in Rajputana&mdash;vanished&mdash;trunk in his bedroom, at
  the Kaiser-i-Hind Hotel at Mount Abu found cut open and looted of unknown
  contents&mdash;one servant, said to be deaf-and dumb, also missing&mdash;the
  other servant paid off. sent home and knows nothing. Private affairs
  apparently in order&mdash;no money trouble&mdash;no debts&mdash;no known
  enemies&mdash;health good&mdash;no probable reason for suicide. Nothing new
  in that file."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice the date?"</p>

  <p>"The eleventh."</p>

  <p>The commissioner pushed a calendar across the table. "Notice anything
  else?"</p>

  <p>"No. The calendar says full moon on the fifteenth, but what of it?"</p>

  <p>"Bear that in mind. Leaving Mount Abu on horseback, tiding leisurely, a
  man might reach Gaglajung in three days. There is an unconfirmed and
  unreliable report that a man who might be David Frensham was seen on foot,
  not far from Gaglajung, on the late afternoon of the fourteenth."</p>

  <p>"Why should he go there?"</p>

  <p>"That's for you to find out. Frensham's friend at Doongar, which is near
  Gaglajung, is a Mohammedan named Abdurrahman Khan. He's a quite unimpeachable
  gentleman, aged seventy&mdash;ex-rissaldar of irregular horse &mdash;three
  medals&mdash;five bars&mdash;<i>persona grata</i>&mdash;old and innocuous. He
  might have supplied a horse or two; he has them. Night, near the full of the
  moon, in Rajputana, is the best time to travel, and horses that reached Mount
  Abu by night and left the same night might not be noticed.</p>

  <p>"Abdurrahman Khan may have liked Frensham as much as I did. He'd be
  capable of doing what he was asked, and saying nothing. Men of his type,
  expecting to die soon, have a way of letting secrets die with them. You won't
  get much out of him, but you may get something, if you're careful and don't
  ask questions."</p>

  <p>Warrender lit a cigarette and glanced in a mirror to see why the
  commissioner kept watching the servant, but the glance told him nothing.
  "Abdurrahman Khan may already have been questioned," he said.</p>

  <p>The commissioner nodded. "Yes. If so, he'll tell nothing at all." He took
  his eyes off the servant at last and looked straight at Blair. "But there are
  some scattered facts worth noting. For instance, Frensham had a photograph of
  Wu Tu among his private papers."</p>

  <p>Blair scowled at that. "Who hasn't? Wu Tu advertises herself like a
  film-star."</p>

  <p>"Know what her name means?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Chinese for 'Five Poisons.'"</p>

  <p>"Right. Wu Tu may have murdered Frensham."</p>

  <p>Blair Warrender held his tongue. He had suggested investigating Wu Tu
  months ago, but no one who was even half-wise reminded the commissioner about
  advice that he had seen fit not to take.</p>

  <p>"David Frensham," the commissioner continued, "has been my intimate
  personal friend for going on thirty years. His wife died more than twenty
  years ago. Aside from his personal kindliness, he was a charming lunatic or a
  great genius, either or perhaps both. An omnivorous reader&mdash;student of
  archaeology and ancient languages&mdash;mathematician&mdash; philosopher. He
  used to read Charles Fort's books. Nothing delighted him more than to prove
  Charles Fort right and everybody else wrong. Do you know Fort's books?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. His daughter Henrietta lent them to me."</p>

  <p>"That's another clue. Keep that also in mind. So far, you've the new moon
  on the fifteenth&mdash;Gaglajung, where a charcoal-burner said he saw a man
  who might be Frensham&mdash; Abdurrahman Khan, who may have provided
  horses&mdash;Wu Tu's photograph&mdash;Charles Fort's books and Frensham's
  known delight in Indian magic. That's stuff that no soldier should tackle,
  although soldiers are the ones who seem most interested. It gets them a 'rep'
  for being unreliable and shuts them off from promotion. Headquarters were
  always glad to let Frensham wander off investigating one thing or another. As
  an Engineer officer he had plenty of opportunities for that, and he did some
  decent Intelligence work. But he couldn't let magic alone. Secret Service
  File FF is half-choked with his reports on that stuff."</p>

  <p>Blair Warrender smiled. "Do you believe in magic?"</p>

  <p>"I am not saying what I believe. That file is raw material for scientific
  study, I don't mind telling you. It contains stories from men returned from
  Himalayan expeditions that would make your hair stand on end. Frensham
  believed magic is the crumbled remnants of an ancient science. That's a clue
  to his disappearance."</p>

  <p>"As you say, sir. I know nothing about magic."</p>

  <p>"Nor I, except what David Frensham told me." The commissioner dropped his
  voice even lower. "But don't forget that some people think they do know. I'm
  about to introduce you to a man who thinks he does; whether he does or
  doesn't is beside the point. Study him."</p>

  <p>His eyes were again on the servant, but his right hand went into a steel
  box on the table. He groped in it among docketed papers. Deliberately,
  slowly, he produced what looked like a block of gold, seven or eight inches
  long by about half that breadth and depth.</p>

  <p>"Look at it," he said. "Take hold of it." It was heavy. Blair weighed it
  in both hands &mdash;examined it narrowly, thumbing a corner where a very
  small piece had been sawn or chipped off.</p>

  <p>"I did that," said the commissioner. "Had it analyzed. Almost pure gold.
  Something less than one half of one per cent of an unknown alloy that makes
  it harder than cast iron. But it seems to become permanently soft, like
  ordinary gold, after being melted two or three times."</p>

  <p>Blair Warrender's eyes betrayed a vague excitement.</p>

  <p>"Pure gold?" he said. "No, not heavy enough."</p>

  <p>"Shake it."</p>

  <p>The thing was hollow. He could feel but not hear movement of something
  loose inside it.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he demanded. It made him angry to have traps set for his
  curiosity; he was not a baby being set conundrums. The commissioner noticed
  that. He seemed amused. He spoke almost absent-mindedly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what it is. The microscope reveals no joint, welding or
  anything like that." He was no longer looking at Blair. He got up, stared at
  the servant near the door, walked over to him and spoke in English.</p>

  <p>"You're a patient rogue. Come and look at it. Let me see you take it in
  your hands."</p>

  <p>The servant's ivory-yellow face revealed no other emotion than a slight
  and hardly visible alertness. He was a big, upstanding man with heavy neck
  and shoulders, handsomely ugly, broad-nosed, intelligent looking, and
  probably almost strong enough to fell an ox with his fist. But the humid heat
  of Bombay had rather slackened his stance. He was sweating.</p>

  <p>"What is it? Look at it. Hold it. Speak!" the commissioner ordered.</p>

  <p>The man's face grinned with sudden wrinkles, and each wrinkle seemed to
  hide a secret. He turned the block over and over in his hands. It appeared to
  excite him but to make him cautious. He conquered the excitement, let the
  wrinkles die, and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not knowing&mdash;knowing nothing about this," he said, in English that
  appeared intentionally mispronounced. Then he shut up&mdash;eyes, mouth,
  attitude. The commissioner seized his wrist and felt his pulse; then he
  ordered him out of the room. When he had gone he chose a fresh cigar, sat
  down and said:</p>

  <p>"Pulse normal. Calls himself Taron Ling&mdash;came to me from a place
  called Naga Kulu in the Northern Punjab. He had one of the most beautifully
  forged testimonials I have ever seen. I took him on to find out what his game
  is."</p>

  <p>"Do you know now?"</p>

  <p>"No more than I know how Frensham vanished. But I know Taron Ling is a
  crook, a hypnotist and a spy, for or against Wu Tu, I don't know which. I
  know he wants, but I don't know why he wants, this gold brick, He knows now
  that I know he wants it. So perhaps he'll chuck trying to steal it, and bolt.
  If he doesn't, I'll scare him properly. I want him to bolt. I want him
  followed." Blair Warrender nodded doubtfully. He knew the odds in favor of a
  fugitive through Indian crowds, with most men and&mdash;worse yet,
  women&mdash;aiding or benevolently neutral. Nobody aids the pursuing police
  except from the thoroughly unreliable motives of fear or revenge. But it was
  no use discussing that; the commissioner would do as he pleased; he always
  did.</p>

  <p>The commissioner put the gold block back into the steel box and locked it.
  "It's Frensham's, I think. It was found in the possession of a Punjabi
  Moslem, who was badly savaged in the riot last Thursday afternoon. He died
  the same night without giving his name or saying anything. But he was
  identified the following morning as the man who murdered Henrietta Frensham's
  ex-chauffeur, who had left her, rather more than two months ago, without
  giving notice. She reported the loss of this
  thing&mdash;woman-fashion&mdash;vaguely. She described it as a hollow block
  made of yellow metal, gave approximate dimensions and said it had been stolen
  from a suitcase in her bedroom. I have thought of opening it."</p>

  <p>"Why not, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Several reasons. It may belong to Frensham, and Frensham may still be
  alive. If it's Henrietta's, it should be opened in her presence; but she
  would then know we have it, and I don't want her to know, not just yet. It
  would be simple, of course, to pretend it was open when found, but&mdash;I've
  a notion the contents have nothing to do with the case, although the thing
  itself may be immensely important."</p>

  <p>"No idea what's in it?"</p>

  <p>"Not an idea. But I've taken two really expert opinions&mdash;E.O. Tate
  and Grish Mukerji. For a wonder they agree. It may be older than the hills.
  I'm not exaggerating. Unofficially&mdash;meaning I'm not to be quoted&mdash;
  I'm one of the naive few who agree with the Theosophists and David Frensham
  and some other cranks that our chronology is all wrong. Hindu chronology may
  be nearer right by millions of years. This gold block may be antediluvian, to
  use a convenient phrase. It was put together as mysteriously as a hen puts
  the shell on an egg.</p>

  <p>"It may be of enormous scientific interest, and my theory is that David
  Frensham found it and went looking for more. Whoever opens it should shave
  off one end by fractions of a millimeter at a time and examine each slice
  microscopically. That would take a long time, and there are very few who
  could do it. But let me tell you about the man I sent out of the room."</p>

  <p>He walked to the door, opened it suddenly, strode into the passage,
  returned and locked the door behind him. Then the phone rang, and for a few
  minutes he sat at his desk in conversation with the office at headquarters.
  Blair sat uncomfortably, smoked irritably, knocking the ash from his
  cigarette with jerks that sent it flying two or three feet accurately into
  the brass tray on the desk. The commissioner prolonged the phone
  conversation, watching him, judging him while he talked.</p>

  <p>At last he clicked the receiver in place and began:</p>

  <p>"Taron Ling is a Tai from somewhere near the Salween country, but he
  doesn't know I know that. His testimonial was forged, in the name of the
  Rajah of Kulu's chief minister, by Dur-i-Duran Singh of Naga Kulu. He is one
  of Wu Tu's intimates, another spy. It's always important to watch the bank
  accounts of such people. Dur-i-Duran Singh of Naga Kulu, Wu Tu of Bombay, and
  Zaman Ali the horse-dealer have been banking too much money.</p>

  <p>"It's usual at this time of year for Wu Tu to send money to Paris,
  Brussels, London and Shanghai; she is very wealthy, and she understands
  foreign exchange. But she has been dealing secretly in bullion. So has Zaman
  Ali. So has Dur-i-Duran Singh, who has.had the colossal impudence to send
  this fellow Taron Ling into my household to spy on me.</p>

  <p>"Taron Ling, mind you, is a hypnotist of more than ordinary skill."</p>

  <p>Blair grinned. "Did he hypnotise you?"</p>

  <p>"No. I'm putting you on guard against him. Wu Tu is another hypnotist.
  Dur-i-Duran Singh is a third. I warn you: if you're drunk, or drugged, or
  tired out, or if conditions are in other ways suitable, such people can make
  you imagine anything whatever that you ever saw, that made a deep impression
  on you. That's the secret of most of the ghosts people see; they're freaks of
  memory, exaggerated by emotion. Men like Taron Ling can make you see
  'em."</p>

  <p>"But why me, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Intuition is usually lazy thinking, eyewashed up to look like brain-work.
  However, intuition tells me you're the best man for this job, and I'm being
  guided by it. Weren't you once engaged to Henrietta Frensham?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir." Blair's eyes came as close to an explosive oath as eyes
  can.</p>

  <p>"Thought of it, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then why not?"</p>

  <p>"Private reasons."</p>

  <p>"Tell 'em."</p>

  <p>There was a pause. In Blair Warrender's eyes there was no surrender. His
  personal views and his personal conduct were not subjects for discussion
  unless they qualified or limited his behavior in the course of duty. Did
  they? The commissioner&mdash;observing, smiling, chewed an unlighted
  cigar&mdash;met him halfway.</p>

  <p>"I suspect her of being concerned in this. Now then. Go on. Tell me."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't in love."</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I wasn't."</p>

  <p>"Pretty close to it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then why not?"</p>

  <p>"Don't like mystery, for one thing. For another, I took exception to her
  warning me against Wu Tu. I don't know how it came to Henrietta's knowledge
  that I had to see Wu Tu in the course of duty. But she asked me about it. I
  showed her a sketch I'd made of Wu Tu, who posed for it, two or three hours.
  As a matter of general interest I told Henrietta about Wu Tu being a British
  subject, of mixed Chinese-Sikh-Portuguese-French parentage. I probably also
  told her that Wu Tu is one of the most intelligent and fascinating women in
  the world."</p>

  <p>The commissioner nodded. "That was no exaggeration. Go on. What
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing definite. But Henrietta warned me I was under Wu Tu's influence.
  I resented it, but that probably wouldn't have mattered. However, when I
  denied it, she didn't believe me, and that did matter."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. You've a temper. Go on."</p>

  <p>"That's all. I'm very fond of Henrietta. But I don't like mystery, and
  she's mysterious. I don't like being disbelieved. And I don't care to make
  love to a woman unless I love her. Possibly I funked it. Anyhow, I put in for
  leave, as you know."</p>

  <p>"And instead of getting it, you were sent to track Zaman Ali. Did it
  skilfully, too. Good God, if I'd given you leave you'd have moped and caught
  the plague or something! Tracking Zaman Ali from Peshawar kept your mind off
  love, I'll warrant! Did I ever mention to you that she's my god-child?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. What does that amount to?"</p>

  <p>The commissioner threw away his cigar and chose another. "Damned if I
  know. Ask the bishop. But I always believe what she tells me, especially when
  she doesn't tell, if you get my meaning. We had some conversation about
  you."</p>

  <p>"What did she say?" Blair's eyes were smoldering fires of governed
  anger.</p>

  <p>"She's in love with you." The commissioner struck a match and carefully
  applied it to the end of his cigar. He took his time about it. Then, "The
  last time David Frensham dined with me, he mentioned it. He said he'd like
  you for a son-in-law."</p>

  <p>"None of his damned business!"</p>

  <p>"So I told him. I volunteered the opinion that Henrietta should marry her
  equal, if there is one. I said you're not nearly good enough, and I'm still
  of the same opinion."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

  <p>"Don't mention it. I'm sending you to spy on Henrietta Frensham."</p>

  <p>Blair stiffened, but the furious light in his eyes grew suddenly subdued.
  He looked calm, as almost always when he sensed a crisis. He could govern
  himself with a will of iron.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, why me, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Because she's in love with you."</p>

  <p>"I call that a good reason for putting another man on the case. I can't in
  common decency&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The commissioner interrupted; "It's the nearest thing to decency at my
  disposal in the circumstances. She is my godchild and Frensham's daughter,
  under more than suspicion of knowing something which she is more likely to
  tell you than anyone else. David Frensham was a strange chap, and in some
  ways simpleminded. I don't entirely exclude the possibility of his having
  been tricked into some sort of criminal escapade. Henrietta may know that.
  Find out."</p>

  <p>"Damn!" Blair muttered.</p>

  <p>"All the same, go and do it. But I've another reason. I believe in
  offering fish the bait they fancy, and my information is that Wu Tu wants to
  see you."</p>

  <p>"Who said so?"</p>

  <p>"Chetusingh. I have had him on this case ever since Frensham vanished. For
  some reason that I can't guess, Wu Tu has a trap set ready for you; I'm
  almost as sure of that as that you're sitting here. I propose you shall walk
  straight into it. She's rather desperate, but I don't think
  dangerous&mdash;to you&mdash;at the moment."</p>

  <p>"In what way desperate?"</p>

  <p>The commissioner loved to parade a worldly wisdom cloaked in unexpected
  phrases. He smiled, knocked the ash from his cigar and sat back in his chair.
  "Did you ever hear of the law of diminishing returns? Wu Tu's profits have
  been prodigious. I don't mean merely cash, although she's very wealthy; she's
  a money-lender and a very skilful mistress of intrigue. She has used her
  money to get influence, and the influence to get more money.</p>

  <p>"She's an, artist at blackmail, and loves it. But the law of diminishing
  returns takes care of everything that overreaches itself, and Wu Tu sees the
  writing on the wall. Her kind of fortune crumbles very rapidly when rot sets
  in, and. she's wise enough to know it. But she's fool enough to squander her
  money on yogis, mediums, alchemists, astrologers&mdash;charlatans of all
  sorts. She is afraid of age, afraid to die; even more afraid of what her
  enemies will do to her when the reins of her intrigues get out of hand and
  the luck begins to flow backward. She can see that coming&mdash;knows she's
  losing her grip. She's a long way from being the first to scour the world for
  a.philosopher's stone, but she has carried it to greater extremes than most
  people can afford. That's how she first came to know Dur-i-Duran Singh of
  Naga Kulu, who claims to have studied alchemy in Tibet. She has sometimes as
  many as twenty agents scouring the Himalayas at her expense for occult
  secrets."</p>

  <p>"Suppose she knows any?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, for what they're worth. Most of them are not worth much. But I
  suspect that this time she is after something big, which Frensham may have
  discovered. And she may have murdered Frensham or, more likely, caused him to
  be murdered. There are rumors; I'm sick of hearing them. That gold block,
  that you saw just now, in some way is connected with it.</p>

  <p>"Henrietta, I think, must have had it from David Frensham. Taron Ling,
  instructed by Dur-i-Duran Singh, and in touch with Wu Tu and Zaman Ali,
  traced it into my possession and tried to steal it. That ties them all up
  together, but we won't bother about Dur-i-Duran Singh for the moment. Let's
  catch Wu Tu first, and a whole house of cards may come tumbling."</p>

  <p>Blair objected. "Henrietta might have had that gold block in her suitcase,
  and known nothing about it. The way she reported its loss suggests that."</p>

  <p>The commissioner laid his cigar down, set both clenched fists on the desk
  and leaned forward. "Henrietta," he said grimly, "knows more than she'll
  tell. To my certain knowledge she has talked with Wu Tu. That may sound
  unlikely, but I know it happened. Now she's in Rajputana, staying with the
  Graynes, in camp near Gaglajung. Do you know the Graynes?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Blair looked noncommittal. The commissioner continued:</p>

  <p>"Grayne's a decent fellow, but a bit slack. Writes ridiculous plays in his
  spare time. Has a Christian Science aunt in the United States, who sends him
  checks and pamphlets. His wife cashes the checks and burns the pamphlets.
  Between the two of them I'd say they'd let a brass band go by without knowing
  which way it went. Grayne being on long leave, is probably composing poetry
  and noticing less than usual. I'm sending you there to find out why Henrietta
  invited herself to stay in the Graynes' camp. Visit Wu Tu first."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"To-night. I will have her house surrounded in case of accident. But mind,
  no accidents! I want facts, not fireworks. I don't want her arrested. I want
  her to bolt. If there's a trap, walk straight into it and use your wits. I've
  a suspicion I know why Wu Tu wants you, and if I'm right you're in no
  immediate danger. You may be kidnaped. If not, make for Gaglajung by train
  to-morrow morning. I'll wire Mount Abu and have a proper bandobast all ready
  waiting for you at Abu Road Station. Take your time about reaching
  Gaglajung&mdash;camp close to villages each night and encourage
  gossip&mdash;learn all you can before you get there."</p>

  <p>Blair scowled. "I would rather go to hell than force myself on
  Henrietta."</p>

  <p>"Yes, hell may have its compensations. You'll be gazetted as on special
  leave, from tomorrow morning. Use the new code for telegrams. Keep me
  posted."</p>

  <p>"Do I work alone, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Howland of the C.I.D. will keep in close touch with you with two or three
  of his men, so look out for signals. I will have Y-Six and Y-Eighty-one on
  your heels; they won't let you out of sight for a minute, once you reach
  Gaglajung. And you're to work with Chetusingh."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather pick my own man."</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with Chetusingh? You trained him. He knows more about this
  than you do."</p>

  <p>"That's the trouble. He's a bit inclined to rush his fences. He and I work
  better when he knows less and listens to me."</p>

  <p>"He has orders to work with you, but to take his own line if he thinks
  that necessary. Pick him up at the Afghan <i>dera</i>; he'll go with you
  to-night. Better not go in uniform. Chetusingh is playing Pathan. You'd
  better do the same. Wu Tu will see through it at once, but it will make you
  less noticeable getting into the house, and once you're in it won't matter.
  Here are two special passes; I've a very special reason for your using them.
  They're bait for Zaman Ali. Don't get killed now. You're a valuable man. And
  don't forget: Facts not fireworks! Colonel&mdash;let's see, no, they'd just
  gazetted him a brigadier&mdash; Brigadier-General David Frensham alive or
  dead! What happened to him&mdash;how? When? where? Hold your tongue, learn
  all you can, and keep me posted. Good night, Blair my boy, and good
  luck."</p>

  <p>Blair Warrender shook hands and walked out, cursing his luck in silence.
  It was bad enough that the commissioner almost never told more than half what
  he knew; one had to work more or less in the dark and learn to like it. But
  to have to thrust himself on Henrietta Frensham and invade her
  privacy&mdash;extract her secrets&mdash;spy on her&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Good God! I supposed I'd never see her again. Well, orders are orders.
  Here goes."</p>

  <p>He sent to his quarters, tubbed, changed and went to the Byculla Club,
  where he dined with a bishop.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">CHAPTER TWO</a></h2>

  <p class="quote">Though the end of my fate be tears, saith the widow, shall I
  take the end for the beginning? Short though this life be, I will laugh while
  I may, and not know sorrow only.</p>

  <p class="quote">&mdash;From the Ninth (unfinished) Book of Noor Ali.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE bishop did his best to understand Blair Warrender. They
  sprawled in deep chairs in the starlight. The bishop wiped sweat from his
  face. Warrender ordered a drink from a soft-footed servant in ghost-white and
  did his utmost to explain himself.</p>

  <p>"I'm a policeman. I'm not in politics. It's my job to try to understand
  what's going on. I'm not permitted prejudices."</p>

  <p>"All the same, you have them," said the bishop. "Mind you, we're not
  discussing religion, or even conventions, least of all politics. But surely
  you are prejudiced against the type of woman represented by this Wu Tu?"</p>

  <p>"There is no worse public danger."</p>

  <p>Warrender signed the chit for the drink with his left hand; his right was
  feeling in his pocket. He pulled out a sketch done in crayon.</p>

  <p>"The woman you have in mind," he said, "looks something like this. Her
  place is a sort of vacation resort, a pleasure palace, if you wish to call it
  that, where she herself presides. Her real purpose is political intrigue,
  and, through it, power for herself. There was rather a long pause while the
  bishop examined the sketch. "If she's like that," he said, "one can imagine
  her hold over Chetusingh. But that only makes it more difficult. I am asking
  ,you to save him from her. What is that woman&mdash;Chinese?"</p>

  <p>"No. The sketch exaggerates the Chinese touch, although it's there. She is
  Portuguese; Chinese-Sikh-French&mdash;born in Hongkong. She's a British
  subject. Anything else you'd care to know about her? I could tell you her
  bank balance and the names of her correspondents in Berlin, New York, Paris.
  Or about the young Chinese widows who help her to entertain."</p>

  <p>The bishop stirred uneasily. "These racial mixtures almost baffle one's
  hope for humanity! If she looks like that she should be at Hollywood playing
  vampire parts. Beautiful, yes. But that's the pity of it. She suggests to me
  an octopus. She reached out one subtly mysterious tentacle and drew
  Chetusingh into her maw. May God have mercy on him."</p>

  <p>"What do you propose?" asked Warrender. "There's no law I know of against
  a woman being beautiful and witty." The bishop handed the sketch back. "Who
  drew that?"</p>

  <p>"I did."</p>

  <p>"Possibly you, too, admire her too much. You didn't do that from memory.
  She must have posed to you for it. Well, you have talent."</p>

  <p>"In my profession," said Warrender, "all a fellow's talents come in
  usefully. Besides, there's the inevitable retirement to bear in mind. When my
  day comes to draw a pension I mean to take up painting&mdash;and live. I'd
  rather be a duffer at that than die of boredom. However, what do you
  suggest?" He returned the sketch to his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Less reprehensible people than Wu Tu are in prison," the bishop answered
  at last. "Such women break laws when it suits them. By breaking down
  character they induce other people to break laws. Like you, I am not in
  politics. But she is. It happens I know that. I have been told so by
  perplexed Indian Christians, who come to me for advice on their personal
  problems. To be in her kind of politics, but out of prison, suggests to
  me&mdash; I can only say tolerance on the part of the police. That may be
  convenient for the moment. It probably is. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was another long pause. The anger in Blair's eyes became less
  latent, but he sat still. The bishop again mopped the sweat from his face;
  then he drew out a cigar case, opened it, snapped it shut and returned it to
  his pocket without taking a cigar. "You are Chetusingh's friend," he said,
  "and he yours. I know you are his hero. He has admitted that to me many times
  in my house, before this Jezebel got hold of him. You have your public duty
  to perform, of course. But you are one of the few men in India to whom a wide
  discretion in the course of duty is absolutely necessary and is therefore
  permitted.</p>

  <p>"It would be useless to deny that; I know it is true. What higher duty
  have you than you owe to a friend and comrade of an alien race, who has
  adopted our religion, in the teeth of a malignant opposition from his family
  and from his whole clan, simply because he admired our principles and our
  adherence to them? You can save Chetusingh from that woman by using your
  authority against her. Do it. Warrender, in the name of common decency, if
  for no other reason."</p>

  <p>"Have you spoken with Chetusingh?" Blair asked him.</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I haven't his confidence since he fell into that woman's
  clutches. He used to ask my advice. Now, on the rare occasions when I see
  him, he is either flippant or silent and, I think, resentful."</p>

  <p>"Rajput pride is touchy stuff," said Blair. "You may have flicked him on
  the raw." He passed his cigarette case to the bishop and their eyes met
  straight for a moment. His were baffling, although the bishop's were as easy
  to understand as plain print: he was hiding nothing. "I will do what I can,"
  he said after a moment, and there was nothing obscure about that remark. It
  was a full stop.</p>

  <p>"Bless you," said the bishop. He lighted the cigarette. The flame of the
  match revealed embarrassment as he snatched at thought after thought for a
  change of subject. "By the way," he asked off-handedly, "any news about
  Brigadier-General Frensham?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"They tell me it's in headlines in the London papers."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Three months missing, and no trace&mdash;no clues&mdash;is it another of
  these insoluble mysteries?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Blair. "Good night, sir."</p>

  <p>"Good night. You forgive my confidences?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing to, forgive. I won't discuss them."</p>

  <p>"Sphinx! Well&mdash;I enjoyed the dinner immensely. Good night."</p>

  <p>Blair walked to police headquarters, answering the salutes of constables
  on duty with a nod and a stare that seemed to act like a tonic. They
  stiffened. Responsibility in some way sat more valiantly on their shoulders
  for having seen him. At headquarters. Indian subordinates stirred as a
  tuning-fork answers a master-tone. He spoke to one dark-eyed veteran, who
  stood at ease with the familiarity of friendship, and who nodded&mdash;deep
  unto deep.</p>

  <p>"All has been ready," the Indian answered, "since the chief telephoned at
  eight-thirty." Later, at nearly eleven o'clock, a Pathan walked out,
  muttering, through the side-street entrance to the detention cells. It was an
  unusual hour, but he could hardly be anything else than a released, prisoner.
  He swaggered with the sulky-jaunty truculence, of a Pathan recovering lost
  dignity, but he looked rather lost and feckless without a weapon. He thrust
  his way between the passers-by, and took the street past the King Edward
  Memorial Hospital toward the <i>dera</i> of the Kabuli Afghans, where the
  horse-traders stay who come down from the North to sell fat-rumped ponies to
  inexperienced British subalterns, and to spread through teeming slums and
  credulous bazaars amazing tales of Northern Asia in arms. As he stood for a
  moment, etched and shadowed by the naked electric light outside the
  <i>dera</i> entrance, a bearded Afghan, on his way out of the <i>dera</i>,
  paused and stared.</p>

  <p>"By God, what wonders next?" the Afghan exclaimed. "O Ismail, what
  knife-feud brought thee hither? It was in Poona I last saw thee. Was the
  Poona hasheesh too strong? Or did the Sellers of Delights neglect thee when
  they had thy money? What now?"</p>

  <p>"Get thee back to Kabul, to thy wife!" Ismail retorted. He pushed past the
  Afghan, swaggering through into the shadowy saddle- and spice-smell of the
  <i>dera</i>, vanishing along a corridor, under a stairway. A key that creaked
  noisily turned behind him. Then the Afghan followed and stood listening, but
  all he heard was the thump of a mattress or something like it against the
  door on the inside. He could see nothing through the keyhole, so he went away
  about. h!s business with the slippered, awkward gait of a middle-aged man who
  has spent two thirds of his life on horse- or camel-back.</p>

  <p>Near midnight, he whom the Afghan had addressed as Ismail walked out of
  the <i>dera</i> with another Pathan and the two walked solemnly along the
  empty streets until they reached the dismal quarter where the mill-hands
  sleep like corpses in the gutter; thence, on through even narrower, shuttered
  and winding alley-ways toward a more prosperous section, where a Hindu temple
  loomed, its shadow lit by little lamps that looked choked by the hot
  dark.</p>

  <p>Near there a police patrol stopped them: it was only three days since some
  Moslems had butchered a sacred cow in that temple entrance, and there are
  more ways than that of defiling Hindu temple steps. But both men shelved
  passes, and the signature on them worked like magic. The police did not even
  wait to watch which way they went.</p>

  <p>They took a rather wider street, where tired trees loomed against the
  stars. Near the end of the street they made peculiar signals on the door of a
  balconied house. There were beggars lurking in the shadows, as always near
  such houses: some of them stirred like graveyard ghouls, observed for a
  moment and then dozed again: they wasted no importunity on Pathan
  night-errants. But there was one near the door, all eyes, amid smelly rags,
  in shadow. He might be a Bauriah&mdash;one of the criminal tribe that shams
  asceticism to impose on poetry. He spoke:</p>

  <p>"Protectors of the poor, nine who have entered this house gave me nothing.
  The Allknowing seeth. The Allseeing knoweth. Alms! Alms!"</p>

  <p>"Allah is all around thee! Allah protect thee! Await His pleasure!"
  answered the Pathan who had been addressed as Ismail. He gave him
  nothing.</p>

  <p>The heavy door opened inward cautiously. The two passed in, in silence,
  into darkness, standing still until the outer door was shut and bolted,at
  their backs. Then an inner door opened suddenly into an electric lighted
  hall, where a number of low-caste, well-dressed servants lurked around a
  heavy wooden stairway, and on the tiles, beside a heavy mat, was a row of
  slippers, some new, some old. but none of Bombay craftsmanship. Both Pathans
  kicked off their footgear: he knew as Ismail tripped on the mat, uncovering a
  pair of imported brown-and-white shoes that looked incongruous in that place,
  but he appeared not to notice them.</p>

  <p>"See that I get my own again," he ordered, scowling so fiercely that the
  custodian of slippers cringed. Then he led up the dark teak stairway without
  ceremony. But a drumstick, pulled by a cord from below, thumped on a gong up
  above to announce him, and a door at the stair-head opened before he reached
  it.</p>

  <p>A young Chinese girl, as insolent as fate, in a jacket and trousers of
  blue-and-amber flowered silk, confronted him beneath a gilded dragon. Behind
  her, down a long corridor, there was mandarin-palace
  loot&mdash;jade&mdash;crystal &mdash;lacquer&mdash;gossamer
  curtains&mdash;rose-hued light from hidden electric bulbs&mdash;a smell of
  sandalwood&mdash; a haze of incense&mdash;weird, dim music. She herself
  looked like an antique, sloe-eyed, with a black fringe straight across her
  forehead. She was smoking a cigarette in a long jade tube. Her intensely
  intelligent eyes &mdash;no other gesture&mdash;observant, indifferent,
  self-assured&mdash; directed both men toward a doorway twenty steps along the
  corridor on the left hand. She closed the stair-head door behind them and
  followed, blowing smoke-rings.</p>

  <p>The Pathans swaggered through a clattering curtain of metallic beads into
  a room part Indian, part Chinese, richly carpeted. There was a long, deep
  divan. On the floor were heaped cushions of gorgeous colors. Opposite the
  door a gilded dragon-screen concealed one corner: and beside that, on a
  mandarin's throne, sat the woman who owned the place. Her age might not be
  guessed. Good humor and the full flood of physical health obeyed
  intelligence, concealing all but what she chose should seem: and she was
  lovelier to the eye than any cream-and-honey quadroon who ever maddened
  Paris. Forbidden knowledge, that had not wearied her, laughed forth from dark
  eyes and carmined lips. Eurasian, slim, so marvelously formed and subtly
  strong that the ease of her poise suggested motion, she was dressed in
  jet-black silk. The jacket, open at the throat, revealed a daffodil-yellow
  lining and a throat that Rodin might have thumbed from creamy meerschaum.</p>

  <p>A big diamond flashed in her dark hair. Pearls on the lobes of her ears
  stole glow and color from her skin. She had jade bracelets that clashed when
  she moved, but no other jewelry: there were no rings on her strong hands, and
  her hands looked young. But even younger and more graceful were the naked
  feet that lazed below the black silk, which suggested rather than revealed
  impudently shapely legs. A hint, but no more than a hint of Chinese hovered
  near her eyes: they were the eyes of the devil, beautiful with love of
  dangerous living.</p>

  <p>"Hello. Warrender," she said.</p>

  <p>"Evening, Wu Tu," he retorted. He seemed undisturbed by being recognized,
  but her eyes darkened.</p>

  <p>"Don't you call me that&mdash;you!"</p>

  <p>"Very well, don't call me Warrender."</p>

  <p>"Blair&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"I am Ismail ben Alif Khan."</p>

  <p>"But why the masquerade? Why don't you come alone to see me? Why bring
  Chetusingh? Why do you choose to dress like Orakzai Pathans? They fight like
  dogs and love like pigs, except when they are drunk with hasheesh; then they
  sleep like stuffed pythons."</p>

  <p>"Let me see behind that screen," said Blair.</p>

  <p>But Chetusingh forestalled him&mdash;too late by a stride; as he reached
  it, a low door hidden by the screen thumped shut and a bolt clicked. She
  seemed indifferent. "You have at least the manners of Pathans."</p>

  <p>Chetusingh moved one wing of the screen away from the wall, so that he
  could watch the low door. Then he and Blair sat on the divan, drawing their
  feet up under them. Blair said something in a low voice and Chetusingh went
  to the curtained door, glancing into the passage both ways, returned and sat
  down again.</p>

  <p>"You are as stupid as Pathans," said Wu Tu. "You know well, Chetusingh,
  that men are not murdered in my house. I don't permit it. Otherwise, why do
  you think that a Rajput Chr-r-ristian" (she filled the words with venom) "was
  here night after night&mdash;and no knife in his liver? Tell me."</p>

  <p>There was no impatience in her voice&mdash;no anger in her eyes, even when
  Chetusingh smiled without answering. She was only making conversation while
  she eyed Blair Warrender. It was his smoldering gaze that amused her. She
  mocked him:</p>

  <p>"Take care! Beware of my merry widows!"</p>

  <p>Weirdly half-heard chords of eastern music from another room
  counter-pointed the inflection of her voice. "Ismail ben Alif Khan the
  Orakzai" (her voice and her smile were almost a caress) "is no concern of
  mine. But Blair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She lingered on the word. Her sinuous ease, giving scented heat and mellow
  light wove and again rewove imagined calm; but its weft and its woof were
  danger, beyond guessing.</p>

  <p>"My merry widows shed humility and meekness and all those vices when they
  left home. Do they care for a Pathan's dignity? What if one of them should
  pull that turban off and laugh at an Englishman's clipped head?"</p>

  <p>"There are nine men here to whom I wish to speak," said Blair
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Set a new spy at the outer door! There are ten men. I would not describe
  them as your bodyguard!" Then she added in the vernacular, <i>"Diwaza bund
  hai."</i></p>

  <p>The news that the outer door was locked made Chetusingh stir
  uncomfortably. Wu Tu drew some paper money from her bosom and without
  glancing at it tossed it into Chetusingh's lap.</p>

  <p>"Go and play with the little widows!"</p>

  <p>Chetusingh was well taught. He examined the money before he tossed it back
  to her. Then he glanced at Blair, who nodded. Chetusingh walked out into the
  corridor and turned left. The Chinese girl parted the curtains, making the
  beads jingle to attract attention; at the hardly noticeable movement of Wu
  Tu's hand she withdrew and followed Chetusingh.</p>

  <p>"Now you are not afraid to talk to me," said Wu Tu.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered.</p>

  <p>She drew her legs up under her and arranged a cushion so that she could
  loll back comfortably.</p>

  <p>"Would you like a drink? Smoke? No? Let us be frank with each other."</p>

  <p>He smiled. "Jenny, are you ever frank with anybody?"</p>

  <p>"Always! But don't you call me Jenny. I am that to the fools whom I
  entertain in my house, and who borrow money from me secretly, and who
  slip&mdash;slip&mdash;slip into my power&mdash;it would surprise you to
  know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't. You needn't brag about it. I could give you a partial list
  of your creditors."</p>

  <p>"To the Sikhs and the men from the North I am Soonia."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Soonia Singh in Berlin, Paris, New York, Brussels?"</p>

  <p>"You know too much. I am Wu Tu to my enemies. To you, Blair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Suit yourself. If you prefer it, I will call you Marie."</p>

  <p>"That is my true name&mdash;Marie d'Alenon. It is on my passport. Let us
  talk truth to each other. Why have you stayed away? And, why send Chetusingh?
  Do you think that nine-and-eighty nights ago I let you sketch me&mdash; sat
  to be stared at by your eyes, that torture because they see so much, and
  burn, and tell me little&mdash;do you think I did that for Chetusingh's
  sake?"</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose I came here to make love to you?" he retorted. "Chetusingh
  was spying on you. You know that."</p>

  <p>"Why him? That convert-puritan so careful of his soul that he draws in his
  breath when he tells unavoidable lies! I tortured him. He would have bored me
  to death if I had not made trouble for him. I let his bishop know that he has
  been dealing in unchristian plans."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because 'I know how he feels toward that bishop&mdash;as a <i>chela</i>
  toward his guru. Yet he might not explain to the bishop, who feels toward him
  as guru to his <i>chela</i>. Are there hotter hooks than that on which to
  draw a convert?"</p>

  <p>"Probably not. What I asked you is, why did you do it?"</p>

  <p>"To bring you here. Why else? I could have had him beaten to death in the
  streets, and none the wiser, but I wanted you here. It wasn't easy" (her eyes
  smiled reminiscently) "to reach the bishop's ear and make him think he
  thought of that. But why didn't you come alone? I want you!" She leaned back
  on the cushion, put her arms behind her head, smiled &mdash;and her smile
  seemed all surrender. "Don't I look good? Don't you like me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I can like without smashing and grabbing. There are ten men here.
  What are they doing?"</p>

  <p>"People come here for amusement."</p>

  <p>"Murder amuse them?"</p>

  <p>"Not in my house, if they murder one another,
  sometimes&mdash;elsewhere&mdash;that is not strange. When was murder anything
  but a natural consequence of"&mdash;she spoke slowly, almost
  purring&mdash;"intruding&mdash;unwisely&mdash;amid emotions not
  understood?"</p>

  <p>He got up. "You may as well come with me," he said. "I am going to
  interview those men."</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Her dark eyes suddenly grew liquid with excitement. There was a
  change in her voice. Beyond, or beneath, or around its luring, lazy
  sensuousness there was an unguarded overtone of danger, like a wolf's yelp
  very far off, coming nearer. "Three months ago, when you sketched me, I
  said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know what you said."</p>

  <p>"You savage! Blair, your cruel heart glows through your eyes! You love
  strength. You love nothing else. You are on the side of the law by accident.
  You have no morals&mdash;none, I tell you! You are only loyal. And to what
  are you loyal? England? You would dread to live in England. You would leave
  India unless it were a battle-ground for all your talents. You love battle,
  because it makes you feel your strength, and you are drunk with strength! So
  to what are you loyal?"</p>

  <p>"To the job," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Not you! You are loyal to your hunger, just like any other savage! Duty?
  That is nothing to you except that it means to be
  strong&mdash;stronger&mdash;strongest&mdash;and then stronger again beyond
  the dream of devils! That is why you love danger."</p>

  <p>"Do I? Well, what of it?"</p>

  <p>"Love me! I am danger!"</p>

  <p>"You love strength in order to corrupt it, Wu Tu."</p>

  <p>"Call me Marie! Are you incorruptible? You dare me? Think a minute! I can
  snap my fingers, Blair, and ruin you."</p>

  <p>"Try it," he answered.</p>

  <p>"You policeman!" She stood up and faced him, laughing. With a naked toot
  she kicked his shin, triumphant, daring him. She wasn't afraid of his
  strength; she craved it. "Love me, you savage! I will give you the keys of
  India&mdash;of Asia! You devil, love me!"</p>

  <p>"Savages don't love," he answered. "Give me a cigarette and don't be
  silly."</p>

  <p>He returned to the divan. She followed and sat beside him, curling up at
  one end with her naked feet toward him. She tossed him her platinum cigarette
  case.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">CHAPTER THREE</a></h2>

  <p class="quote">Abide thou the time and the tide of events, lest strength go
  wasted and thy skill, in vain exerted, fall in to the scales against thee.
  Silence is the arsenal of Wisdom.</p>

  <p class="quote">&mdash;From the First of the Nine Books of Noor Ali.</p><br>

  <p class="first">BLAIR examined the cigarette case, pressed the diamond
  catch, sniffed the cigarettes, selected one and gave the case back. He did
  not take the first, nor the last, nor the middle one; and before he touched
  it to his lips he tapped it on the little lacquered table, on which there
  were a jade vase and a small but monstrous figurine that looked like molded
  gold.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu promptly chose a cigarette at random, lighted it, blew a smoke-ring,
  laughed and leaned toward him, proffering the lighter. Their eyes met above
  it. The scent of her reached his nostrils. For a moment she looked older than
  he did, but that look vanished.</p>

  <p>"It is fear of me that poisons you." she murmured. "Not to trust me is as
  dangerous as not to trust yourself. Blair?"</p>

  <p>"Who was behind that screen?" he asked her.</p>

  <p>She shrugged indifference. "Probably someone. I have many servants."</p>

  <p>"Why did you call me Warrender so promptly when I came in?"</p>

  <p>"I was so glad to see you. I should have said Blair, shouldn't I?"</p>

  <p>"Somebody behind that screen was listening and passed the news to someone
  else," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Why were you scared when I started for the next room?"</p>

  <p>"Love me&mdash;and be safe," she said, smiling. "Don't I look good? I am
  even better than I look. Seize the nettle&mdash;strongly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And the cobra by the throat!" he added.</p>

  <p>"Blair, I warn you&mdash;you strong, leopard-eyed devil! India isn't safe
  for one whom&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He finished the sentence for her: "&mdash;Zaman Ali fears! Zaman Ali
  suspected me as Ismail ben Alif Khan. But now he knows I am Blair Warrender.
  He knows I am here, and the is outer door locked. He knows now who has been
  watching him. Nine of his accomplices are here to-night, and he knows that
  Chetusingh, and consequently I, know all their names. He is probably not such
  a fool as to murder me here, supposing he could do that. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't even know why he is in Bombay," she retorted calmly. "I could
  tell you. How else can you find out? I can give you Zaman Ali! That
  pig&mdash;" Her eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"Blair, you may have for the taking what he craves but is too much of a
  sot to imagine! Power! You understand me?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"There isn't a guilty secret worth knowing in all India that I can't tell
  you."</p>

  <p>He nodded again. His eyes did not reveal that he doubted her, if he
  did.</p>

  <p>"Do you understand, too, that you are alive because I wished it? Any crazy
  failure of a student with a cheap revolver could have shot you and not known
  who directed him or why he did it. Isn't life good?" She leaned toward him.
  "You don't guess how good it can be!"</p>

  <p>Her hand touched his. He let his lie still.</p>

  <p>"What can you do to Zaman Ali? Arrest him? What would that accomplish? You
  have no proofs against him that a court would look at.. He would soon be at
  liberty. But you? Death's arm is longer than life's desires! Nobody but I can
  save you now from Zaman Ali and his gang. But what if I give them to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"Love me."</p>

  <p>He knocked the ash from his cigarette into the jade vase on the lacquer
  table, using his left hand. She was fingering his right hand; on the divan.
  He stared at the golden figurine, whose monstrous, sub-human face seemed wise
  beyond all emotion; whoever had made it, knew neither love nor hate but only
  irony.</p>

  <p>"Look at me, not at that! You catch sprats, you policemen, but the sharks
  escape you, because of the laws of evidence, and because you seek peace, not
  power. I don't seek power. I already have it!"</p>

  <p>"And you're wealthy," he suggested, not withdrawing his hand when she
  raised it to her lap with both hers.</p>

  <p>Triumph stole into her eyes. "Blair, have you ever, even for a moment,
  felt the strength of money&mdash;the thrill of the strength of money that
  obeys you? I have money! Men and women&mdash;some of them so important that
  they dare not risk discovery&mdash;owe me more money than you have ever
  dreamed of having. It is secret, unpayable debts that crack the whips of
  power. But to you I would not lend. To you I give!"</p>

  <p>"Blair, why do you look at me in that way? Tell me."</p>

  <p>Suddenly his right hand that she fondled seized her wrist and she checked
  a scream, half terrified but half believing what she hoped. She tried to
  break his grip, but could not.</p>

  <p>"Chetusingh," he said, "should have been back before now. What has
  happened to him?"</p>

  <p>"How do I know? You hurt me! Do you hear, you hurt me! I didn't want that
  fool in here, so&mdash;you savage, let go of my wrist!" But his grip
  tightened. She writhed&mdash;kicked &mdash;and then struck at his face. His
  turban fell, revealing his crisp-curled gladiator head.</p>

  <p>"Scream, why don't you?"</p>

  <p>Venom stole into her eyes. Her right hand moved toward her bosom. Suddenly
  she snatched out a six-inch weapon like a bodkin, dagger-handled. "Damn
  you?"</p>

  <p>She struck. He caught her right wrist in his left hand&mdash;twisted it.
  She kicked with her naked feet. He twisted her wrist steadily until she
  groaned through set teeth and the loosed weapon thumped to the floor. He held
  both wrists in one hand then and leaned on her to prevent her from kicking
  his head as he reached down to recover the weapon. When he had it he let go
  of her.</p>

  <p>"How many poisons, Wu Tu? Five?" he asked her, but for the moment she had
  no breath to answer him. He pressed the point of the knife on the gilded wood
  behind the divan; the hollow bodkin-blade yielded a little against a spring
  within the golden handle. Through an almost invisible hole in the point of
  the blade there oozed a colorless fluid. He sniffed it; and as he did that,
  the hand of the Chinese girl in the corridor parted the doorway curtain. He
  could see her eyes behind the hand.</p>

  <p>"Send her for help," he suggested. "She might bring Zaman Ali."</p>

  <p>Without turning her head&mdash;fixedly watching his eyes&mdash;Wu Tu
  dismissed the girl with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"Damn you, Blair, what do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Truth," he said. "Tell it. Why are you afraid of Zaman Ali?"</p>

  <p>"I?" She was chafing her right wrist. "You think I fear him&mdash;or you?
  You shall learn what fear is!"</p>

  <p>Weird, wild music swelled and ceased, as if a door had been suddenly
  opened and swiftly closed. Her anger stole away behind new laughter in her
  dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"Now you have a very deadly weapon," she said. "Kill me if you dare, while
  you can. What are you waiting for?"</p>

  <p>"For Chetusingh," he answered. There was a carpet-deadened footfall in the
  corridor. Blair rose to his feet. Wu Tu watched him, fascinated. His eyes,
  unafraid but alert, were aware of peril, but the dagger in his right hand
  seemed to bother him. It was not his type of weapon. Suddenly he raised it
  shoulder high and plunged its point into the lacquered table-top between the
  jade vase and the golden figurine. He struck so deep that the dagger-handle
  scarcely quivered. Then the jangling curtains parted. Zaman Ali strode in.
  His were bold eyes, arrogant with triumph. But he looked wary. He was in no
  haste. Close, behind him. as he stood thrusting out his stomach, with his
  hands in a broad Bokhariot belt, the Chinese girl's ivory hand made a signal
  and vanished. The Afghan's beard, new-dyed, lent red to the glare of angered
  cunning in his wind-wild eyes. But his lips smiled, showing strong teeth
  stained with pan. His Bokhariot coat hung loosely and revealed a silk shirt
  that hinted at rubbery muscle beneath. His coned cap. turbaned in silk, sat
  jauntily. His curved, coarse nose, that spread until the curves went astray
  in the fierce mustache, twitched. He rubbed it&mdash;but that might have been
  to attract attention to the ruby in the ring on his middle finger.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mashallah</i>! God's wonders never cease!" he said in Pushtu. "Ismail
  ben Alif Khan is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Warrender of the police. What are you doing in Bombay, Zaman Ali?"</p>

  <p>"Praised be God, I sold my horses. Please God, I shall now learn why I was
  watched&mdash; from the Pass to Peshawar&mdash;to Delhi&mdash;to
  Umballa&mdash; to Nuklao&mdash;to Ahmedabad&mdash;to Cawnpore&mdash; to
  Poona&mdash;to Bombay. A Pathan I knew you were not. Had I known you are
  Warrender&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His fingers, stained and calloused, closed on an imaginary weapon.</p>

  <p>"Peace! Not in my house!" Wu Tu warned in a sharp voice. She. too, spoke
  in Pushtu. Blair answered in English, "Don't be a damned fool, Zaman Ali. The
  door's locked,, and you've nine men. But did Chetusingh tell you the house is
  surrounded? You didn't expect that, did you?"</p>

  <p>"What of it?" Zaman Ali shrugged his shoulders. Then he swaggered to the
  divan and sat beside Wu Tu, drawing his legs up under him. Almost
  imperceptibly she shrank away; and almost he contrived to look as if he owned
  the place. But there was something lacking. He was not quite at his ease.</p>

  <p>"Where did you come from to Peshawar?" Blair demanded. "You didn't bring
  your string of horses down the Khaiber. They were a blind. You picked them up
  in Peshawar. I know who sold them to you."</p>

  <p>The Afghan stared, not answering.</p>

  <p>"What did you do in Rajputana?"</p>

  <p>"Allah! Where I was not, what did I? That is a good conundrum!"</p>

  <p>"When did you last see Brigadier-General Frensham?"</p>

  <p>Insolently, Zaman Ali called to the Chinese girl in the corridor to fetch
  his water-pipe. Then: "I never heard of him." he answered.</p>

  <p>"Do you think in the jail you might remember?"</p>

  <p>"Allah!" Zaman Ali glanced at Wu Tu. but she avoided his eyes. She glanced
  at the door behind the screen. Blair strode to the door and kicked the panel.
  The door opened inward a few inches, struck something or someone and shut
  with a thud. A bolt clicked.</p>

  <p>"Where is Chetusingh?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Dead," said Zaman Ali. "Where did you suppose he is?"</p>

  <p>Wu Tu laughed at that. The wolf-yelp overtone was nearer than it had been.
  She lighted a cigarette and looked straight at Blair, then leaned back
  lazily, blowing smoke-rings.</p>

  <p>"Dead." she said. "Perhaps. But you prove it!"</p>

  <p>"Prove it, yes," said Zaman Ali. "That will be a piece of work for the
  police!"</p>

  <p>"You surround my house," said Wu Tu. "Don't you think I knew that?"</p>

  <p>"There's a secret passage from your cellar to the yard behind Grish Lal's
  godown. Did you know I knew it?" Blair retorted. "That's blocked."</p>

  <p>Wu Tu looked slightly startled, but the look in her eyes changed to
  clouded cunning. She shrugged a bit further away from Zaman Ali.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to look for Chetusingh," said Blair. He reached the doorway in
  three strides, turned facing them and backed through the curtain, colliding
  with the Chinese girl. He groped for her&mdash;he was watching for a move by
  Wu Tu or Zaman Ali. His hand closed on her neck and she offered no
  resistance. When he glanced at her she blew cigarette smoke in his face.</p>

  <p>He shoved her along in front of him and tried the door of the next room,
  twenty feet along giving passage. It appeared to be locked, but he could hear
  laughter and music. The Chinese girl suddenly thrust at his eyes with her
  lighted cigarette. He grabbed her wrist and then almost lost consciousness in
  a blaze of agony as something struck him on the back of the head from
  behind.</p>

  <p>"The commissioner was right. It's a trap, and I'm in it," was his first
  thought. "Now what?"</p>

  <p>The pain was welcome; he knew he could not have felt it if he had been -
  knocked out. He let his knees yield under him, and as he fell, amid the fire
  that flashed in his eyes he saw the Chinese girl!s face smoking the cigarette
  in the jade tube, calmly indifferent. He closed his eyes again and lay still.
  He felt himself being searched by experienced hands; the police pass that he
  had shown to the patrol crackled as someone took it from its envelope. He
  heard Wu Tu's voice:</p>

  <p>"You dog! If you killed him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then Zaman Ali's, speaking Pushtu: "Wah, wah&mdash;dogs' names on a
  woman's tongue&mdash;death in her heart! Nay, tie him. Tie his hands behind
  him. Bring him back here."</p>

  <p>Someone seized his arms. Some other man tied his wrists unmercifully
  tight. Then he was dragged by the feet, face downward. He contrived to raise
  his head an inch or two to save his face from being skinned, but the Chinese
  girl set her foot on it promptly, not pressing, however, as hard as she might
  have done. He took that for a hint and guessed she was obeying Wu Tu's
  order.</p>

  <p>Once in the room, they turned him on his back and he glimpsed that the
  door behind the screen was opened wide. He could feel blood on his face and
  he suspected he looked a pretty bad casualty, so he kept his eyes shut and
  lay still. He could hear Wu Tu's voice arguing in whispers, but could not
  distinguish words, until at last she said in English angrily:</p>

  <p>"You heard me say no! You have got what you wanted. Now go to the devil
  and I will take what I want!"</p>

  <p>Water was dashed in his face, again and again, so he opened his eyes. The
  Chinese girl was dipping water in a cup from a crystal bowl. She seemed quite
  uninterested and kept on splashing until he sat up. Then he almost betrayed
  astonishment, because Chetusingh stood staring at him, smiling and apparently
  awaiting orders.</p>

  <p>"Loose my hands!" he commanded. "Look sharp!"</p>

  <p>"There!" said Wu Tu's voice. Someone else exclaimed "Allah!" Wu Tu again:
  "Does that satisfy you?"</p>

  <p>Then he knew the man was not Chetusingh, but someone remarkably like him
  who was dressed in Chetusingh's clothes and had studied the Rajput's
  mannerisms.</p>

  <p>"He will do in the dark," said Wu Tu.</p>

  <p>She was on the divan beside Zaman Ali. Three men who might be Punjabis
  stood near them, but they were dressed in bazaar-made English suits, with
  brass watch-chains. They looked like deadly-respectable merchants on a night
  out.</p>

  <p>Near them was an Afghan in silver-rimmed spectacles, who looked like a
  teacher of the Koran. And there was another man who might be
  anything&mdash;Sikh, Dogra, Mahratta&mdash;in a well cut blue serge suit, who
  had an undefinable look of being well educated; but he looked silly in
  striped socks. His must be the brown-and-white shoes under the mat
  downstairs. He had a blackjack in his hand and the sight of that made Blair
  realize that his head ached. He could feel a big bruise swelling where the
  blackjack had hit him.</p>

  <p>"Why do you wait?" asked Wu Tu. It was a command. There was much more than
  a hint of a threat in her voice and the man who looked like Chetusingh made a
  gesture toward the curtained doorway, flourishing Chetusingh's police pass.
  All five men followed him through the curtain. Other men&mdash;Blair could
  not see how few or how many&mdash;joined them in the corridor. The Chinese
  girl went and let them out by the door at the stair-head, while Zaman Ali sat
  gloating over Blair's police pass.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mashallah</i>!" he remarked. "It is signed by the commissioner! The
  great&mdash;the wise commissioner, whom none mistrusts but all obey! 'Pass
  bearer on government duty!' <i>Wah! Wah</i>!"</p>

  <p>He produced a fat wallet and discovered, after groping in its crowded
  pockets, a photograph of himself, about passport size. The Chinese girl
  brought paste; he pasted the photograph on to the pass. She brought Chinese
  ink; he impressed his thumb-print on the photograph. The killer-grin hardened
  the rims of his eyes and the sides of his mouth.</p>

  <p>"May God reward thee!" he said, staring at Blair. "Soon!" he added. "If I
  give thee choice of knife or bullet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Blair's voice sounded strangely far off to himself, because his head
  throbbed and it was very difficult to keep the room from seeming to whirl
  around him.</p>

  <p>"Save yourself from the noose if you can, Zaman Ali!" he answered. "Why do
  you hesitate?"</p>

  <p>Wu Tu spoke up, "It is to me you owe that you are not dead."</p>

  <p>Zaman Ali stuck the pass into his wallet and rubbed the palms of his hands
  together.</p>

  <p>"Never a woman yet told more than half a truth," he said. "Ye hold each
  other's lives in trust. Let up oh me! If not, she and you shall learn
  together&mdash;the feel of the finger of death!" He said that slowly.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu, also speaking slowly, added, "Honorably&mdash;now&mdash;you have to
  save my life, too."</p>

  <p>Blair glanced at the knife he had stuck in the table-top, and noticed that
  the golden figurine was missing. "Rot!" he answered. "What are you afraid of,
  Zaman Ali?"</p>

  <p>The Afghan grinned. "If there is a truth under heaven," he said, "it is
  this, it is this: that a fish stinks from the head first. Like officer, like
  rank and file. Now that I know who tracked me from Peshawar, shall I doubt
  who should die first, if the police make any trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Tell where Frensham is. That's the only way to save trouble," Blair
  retorted. "That stolen pass may get you out of Bombay, but it won't save your
  neck in the long run."</p>

  <p>There was a north-wind look in Zaman Ali's eyes: it was weirdly out of
  place in that hot, exotic room.</p>

  <p>"Frensham?" he asked. "Who is he?"</p>

  <p>The door at the stair-head thudded shut and the Chinese girl spoke through
  the curtain in Chinese to Wu Tu, who translated tor Zaman Ali's benefit:</p>

  <p>"They have escaped the police, who thought it was Chetusingh and obeyed
  him. The police went away."</p>

  <p>"The police are fools, and their mothers were wild she-swine," said Zaman
  Ali. "I will go before they come back, furious to regain whatever pride such
  pigs have."</p>

  <p>He gave the Chinese girl some silver money, which she accepted without a
  murmur of thanks, although she glanced at the money. Then he stared at Wu Tu,
  and she nodded. Turning his back then, and without another glance at Blair,
  he swaggered through the jingling curtain. The Chinese girl let him out by
  the stair-head door. Wu Tu smiled.</p>

  <p>"Do you understand, Blair?" she asked. "You are to forget this. Zaman Ali
  needed passes. Now he has them it is all right."</p>

  <p>"Loose my wrists," he answered. With an effort that made his head surge
  with pain he struggled to his feet and waited for her. Wu Tu hesitated,
  listening. There was an opened window somewhere, perhaps on a higher floor.
  Muffled by intervening passages and curtains came the familiar riot-roar of
  Moslems pursuing Hindus.</p>

  <p><i>"Ya Allah! Din! Din!"</i></p>

  <p>It was like a squall of wind smiting the hot night&mdash;sudden&mdash;over
  in a moment&mdash;vanishing along a dark street in silence.</p>

  <p>"Thus," said Wu Tu, "if the oh-so-sly police did not really go away, Zaman
  Ali had been swept out of their clutches. He will keep the pass for later on.
  Will you sit still if I loose you?"</p>

  <p>"No. Where's Chetusingh? They'd have killed me it they'd killed him."</p>

  <p>"Murder," she answered, "isn't done in my house. Chetusingh isn't here any
  longer." She began to unfasten his wrists, picking at the tight knots,
  swearing at them, until the Chinese girl brought a knife. Warrender held out
  his freed wrists for the girl to chafe. Her hands were strong, but so small
  that he laughed and turned to Wu Tu.</p>

  <p>"You do it."</p>

  <p>He sat beside her on the divan, setting his teeth because movement brought
  surges of pain to his head. Wu Tu chafed his wrists and ordered ice, which
  the Chinese girl brought in the crystal bowl and applied skilfully. Then, at
  a glance from Wu Tu, the Chinese girl carried out the lacquered table, in
  which the poisoned dagger was sticking upright, and brought in a silvered
  brazier from which there oozed an erotic symphony of blended
  perfume&mdash;soundless music that lazed on the air, half-visible as green
  gray smoke. She washed the blood then from Warrender's forehead.</p>

  <p>"Better now?" Wu Tu asked him.</p>

  <p>He reached over her lap, took the knife that she had laid beside her on
  the divan and, without glancing at it, sent it spinning through the open door
  beyond the screen.</p>

  <p>"Much better," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Then listen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted. "Tell me what you know of Frensham."</p>

  <p>She looked straight in his eyes. "Blair&mdash;better make friends with me,
  hadn't you? You're a fool if you don't. You can't make trouble for me. All
  you have had from me is first aid, after coming here disguised and getting
  into a brawl. Line up all my little widows if you like and see what
  <i>they</i> say! Two or three of them might even lodge a claim against you,
  for hitting them when you were drunk. Could you deny it? What would you say
  to the magistrate?"</p>

  <p>Blair recalled instructions: "Walk straight into the trap and use your
  wits!" His wits suggested that it might be wise to walk in looking not too
  confident. He sat silent, letting his face express a medley of emotions. Wu
  Tu talked on:</p>

  <p>"People don't love the police. And I have influence. If you were publicly
  charged with a drunken assault in my house, could you keep it quiet? Half a
  million Indians would seize that opportunity to make a scandal and to be more
  bitter than ever against the British. Your commissioner would let you be a
  scapegoat. And then what?"</p>

  <p>"What do you suggest?" he asked after a moment.</p>

  <p>"Let us be friends, you and I. I will make you famous!"</p>

  <p>It went against the grain to nibble that bait, but he did it. "Will you
  tell me about Frensham?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! You think that perhaps I know. Perhaps I do know. Little widows
  learn big secrets&mdash;sometimes. That is why I have them."</p>

  <p>"Where's Chetusingh?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Hah! You saw him leave my house with a police pass! How should I know
  where he went? And what if Chetusingh is my man? Eh? What of it? Didn't he
  turn Christian? Can't he turn a coat again? I could afford to buy a thousand
  of him!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;what of Frensham?"</p>

  <p>"If I show you how to find him&mdash;if I give you that pig Zaman Ali to
  hang, and all his riff-raff with him&mdash;are we friends, you and I?"</p>

  <p>She lay back on the cushions, inbreathing the perfumed smoke. Her eyes
  were excited. Her limbs, that were really tensely still, stole movement from
  the fan-blown silk of her clothing. Even the whirring of the electric fan
  contributed something to the sensuous effect; and through the open door
  behind the screen came slow strains of half-smothered music. The trap was
  plain enough. And Blair's head ached. Wu Tu knew that, so he closed his
  eyes&mdash;lay back lazily, dreading a prick from a poisoned
  dagger&mdash;drugs&mdash;perhaps chloroform&mdash;glad that his head ached,
  since it helped him cling to consciousness.</p>

  <p>The Chinese girl approached in silence, watched him for interminable
  seconds, and then laid cunningly sensitive hands on his temples and over his
  eyes. If that was meant to hypnotise him, she was out of luck. It had the
  opposite effect; it stirred alertness; it was even rather difficult to sham
  sleep. Wu Tu leaned over him, perfumed, adding some kind of movement that did
  have a calming effect, but the Chinese girl's hands were an irritant. Between
  their united efforts he was as fully awake as he ever had been in his
  life.</p>

  <p>"Blair!" Wu Tu leaned over him, breath to breath. In a tiger's fangs a man
  might feel the same sensation of numbed dreaminess; but the Chinese girl's
  fingers kept stroking his eyes, and he wondered whether she knew she was
  keeping time to the pulse of his headache. She was undoing all the effect of
  Wu Tu's efforts. He lay still, breathing steadily, until at last she pinched
  the lobe of his ear&mdash;he supposed, to find out whether he was conscious.
  Getting no response, she pressed the bruise on the back of his head. He was
  not sure whether he winced at that or not; however, he thought not, because
  she stood by after that and did nothing, while Wu Tu spoke:</p>

  <p>"Blair! You are asleep&mdash;asleep&mdash;asleep. You hear me
  speaking&mdash;Wu Tu speaking, whom you know as Marie. You obey Marie because
  you trust her, and because she knows how to promote you to money and high
  position. You know the police are fools. You know the police will waste time
  following some unimportant people who are using Chetusingh's and your passes.
  But you will say nothing about that. You will let them do it, while you do
  real work. You know how to find where David Frensham is. You will go to
  Henrietta&mdash; straight from here to Henrietta. You love Henrietta and she
  loves you. You will make her tell you what she knows.</p>

  <p>"Blair, you are a man! You impose your will. You will have your own way
  with your woman. You are strong. You love with the strength of a savage. She
  shall tell you her secrets. Henrietta shall tell you her secrets&mdash;all
  her secrets. You will make her tell them. Henrietta is your woman."</p>

  <p>Nothing could be better calculated to make him shy of Henrietta. Blair's
  instincts were savagely decent. If he loathed one insolence more than
  another, it was to be told how to govern his private thoughts. Left to
  himself, he might have fallen utterly in love with Henrietta; he knew that.
  But her father had tactlessly tried to encourage him; he had almost never
  even to himself confessed that reason for shying off, but it was true, and he
  knew it was true.</p>

  <p>As a police officer he was perfectly willing to die blindly obeying
  official orders; as a private individual he would much rather die than have
  his private judgment interfered with, uninvited. That Henrietta's father and
  even Henrietta herself should have talked it over with the commissioner was
  their privilege, no doubt. Blair had his privilege too; he could go his own
  way.</p>

  <p>But what the devil did all this mean? How had Henrietta become involved
  with Wu Tu? They had Held some conversations, said the commissioner, to his
  certain knowledge; but one thing, at least, was unthinkable; he was no such
  cad as to imagine that Henrietta even guessed what Wu Tu was trying to do to
  him. To be told whom he should love, by a notorious quarter-caste, and to be
  instructed by her how to behave toward the object of his directed emotions,
  was only less abominable than Wu Tu's gall in daring even to mention
  Henrietta's name. He was enraged to the depths of his savage obstinacy. But
  he lay still.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu spoke to the Chinese girl. He cursed himself for not knowing more
  than ten words of the Chinese language. He heard the bead-curtain jingle as
  the girl left the room.</p>

  <p>"Sleep&mdash;sleep&mdash;you are asleep!" said Wu Tu.</p>

  <p>Shortly after that he heard a man's footsteps in the corridor, barefooted,
  rutching along the carpet with irregular
  steps&mdash;thump-shuffle-thump-thump-shuffle-thump-thump. He knew that
  signal&mdash;listened. It was repeated. It was in his and Chetusingh's code,
  known to nobody else and devised for emergencies. Twice repeated, it could
  hardly be coincidence. It meant:</p>

  <p>"Carry on independently of me for the time being."</p>

  <p>The stair-head door opened and shut, and the Chinese girl returned into
  the room. She resumed manipulations with her hands on Blair's temples and
  presently&mdash;he supposed, to find out whether he was
  conscious&mdash;pressed the bruise on his head. He winced perceptibly, but
  she appeared not to notice it. Wu Tu spoke with her lips so close to Blair's
  face that he breathed her perfumed breath.</p>

  <p>"Blair! You will go straight from here to the commissioner. You will say
  to the commissioner that Zaman Ali and his gang are escaping from Bombay with
  stolen passes and will probably scatter. Let the police pursue them. You will
  say that Wu Tu told you she is going to Lahore, with all her companions. You
  will tell him you yourself should go at once to Henrietta Frensham in order
  to question her, because Wu Tu says that Henrietta knows what happened to her
  father.</p>

  <p>"You will say that Wu Tu gave you good advice and is assisting the police.
  You will insist on seeing Henrietta. Should the commissioner refuse, you will
  be mutinous. You will put in for leave. If the leave is refused, you will go,
  nevertheless; you will depend on Wu Tu to protect you with secret
  influence.</p>

  <p>"You must see Henrietta&mdash;you must see her. You will see her. Nothing
  shall prevent it. She loves you and you love her. You will make her tell her
  secret. And to help you&mdash;to remind you&mdash;Wu Tu's eyes shall watch
  you&mdash; always&mdash;always. You shall see Wu Tu's eyes by day and night.
  They protect. They remind."</p>

  <p>The Chinese girl touched his hand with the end of a lighted cigarette. It
  was only the least touch. He endured it. Then some scented females came and
  peeped at him. They giggled and made silly jokes. Wu Tu sent them all out of
  the room but followed, and he heard her talking to them in the corridor in
  Hindustanee. He could not hear what was said, but he had no doubt she was
  instructing them what to say if questioned. He began to wonder when to wake
  up.</p>

  <p>Presently the stair-head door shook to the thump of policemen's cudgels.
  Wu Tu hurried in and shook him, slapping the backs of his hands and
  commanding him to wake. He let her grow half-hysterical before he opened his
  eyes, sat up and stared.. She faced about toward the curtained doorway, and
  there stood Govind Singh, a veteran from police head-quarters, with two
  constables at his back.</p>

  <p>"<i>Hokee mut</i>&mdash;drunk said Wu Tu and shrugged her shoulders. "You
  should teach your officers not to be quarrelsome when they are drunk. This
  one came to not much harm, but he was fortunate."</p>

  <p>Govind Singh, bearded, erect, official, with a row of medal-ribbons,
  strode into the room and picked Blair's turban off the floor. He put it on
  him, a bit clumsily, neither man saying a word; as Govind Singh helped him to
  his feet his eyes did not reveal that Blair's hand, clutching his arm, was
  making dot-dash signals. Looking sternly disapproving, and lending Blair the
  use of his left arm, the veteran started for the door; but his right hand
  clutched the paper money that Wu Tu let fall for the Chinese girl to pick up
  and give him as he shouldered his way through the curtain.</p>

  <p>Blair said nothing to Wu Tu, but smiled as he passed her. He seemed
  puzzled, as if searching memory. Her answering smile, as she put her fingers
  over her eyes and peered at him between them, was
  assured&mdash;contented&mdash;knowing. Outside, in the dark street, out of
  earshot of the darker shadows, as Blair marched beside Govind Singh at the
  head of six policemen two by two, the Sikh spoke:</p>

  <p>"Should I have come, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"I expected you sooner."</p>

  <p>"Idiots returned saying Chetusingh came forth from Wu Tu's house with many
  men and ordered them back to the <i>khana</i>. They said he showed them his
  pass. What does that mean?"</p>

  <p>"Report it to the commissioner."</p>

  <p>"And Wu Tu? What of Wu Tu, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"How much did she give you? I wasn't looking."</p>

  <p>They tramped all the rest of the way to police headquarters in
  silence.</p>

  <p class="quote">Under sun or stars there is no saying, of fool or wise man,
  that is nearer the truth than that now is the appointed time. But it may be
  the time for waiting. And it may be the time for patience. When I said to my
  Teacher: "Tell me what to do now, I will do it," he went fishing.</p>

  <p class="quote">&mdash;From the Seventh of the Nine Books of Noor
  Ali.</p><br>

  <p class="first">DAY dawned mystically as it always does in Indian hot
  weather. It is said that children born at daybreak bring with them into the
  world a mysticism and a great sense of beauty that they never lose.</p>

  <p>The driver was a Sikh who never heard of nerves, so the commissioner's car
  wove like a shuttle amid creaking bullock-carts and sleepy pedestrians.</p>

  <p>"Are you quite sure your head is all right?" the commissioner asked. It
  was the second time he had asked that since they, sped over the bridge that
  connects Bombay with the mainland.</p>

  <p>"Aches a bit. It'll be all right in the train."</p>

  <p>Blair Warrender sat relaxed and leaned his head back. Telling the
  commissioner&mdash;being cross-examined by him&mdash;had been hard work. He
  retorted with a question: "Did they describe the man who used my pass?"</p>

  <p>"Vaguely. He was seen by lamplight. The guard at the bridge-head took it
  for granted he was you. The pass said Ismail ben Alif Khan. There was a
  thumb-print on the attached photograph and everything appeared to be in
  order. He said the photo resembled the bearer. That, of course, is
  questionable. He probably didn't look carefully. As a matter of routine he
  phoned headquarters after the man was gone. Headquarters got me out of bed at
  once. Zaman Ali was not at the <i>dera</i>."</p>

  <p>"Was the man alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Chetusingh's pass was used by nine men?"</p>

  <p>"In a stolen Ford truck, at three forty-five a.m. There's nothing against
  the owner of the truck. The men are at large; they'll turn up somewhere,
  using the passes, and get arrested. The point is, Zaman Ali double-crossed
  himself. He is using the stolen passes to draw a red herring behind his own
  trail. He thinks he's thrown us off the scent. He hasn't."</p>

  <p>Blair scowled, keen on his job and yet dreading it. "I'm in the dark," he
  said. "I can't guess why I wasn't murdered last night&mdash; once by Wu Tu,
  once by Zaman Ali. They both had a chance. I obeyed orders and behaved like
  an imbecile&mdash;walked straight into an obvious trap, and took all
  chances."</p>

  <p>"I only know one other officer who could do that," said the commissioner
  in one of his bursts of generosity, "Most men would have been clever at the
  wrong time."</p>

  <p>Blair had an almost superstitious dread of being praised before a job was
  finished, so he talked for the sake of talking, using words as an umbrella
  against bad luck:</p>

  <p>"Wu Tu did her best to scare me&mdash;I mean inside-psychic-scare
  me&mdash;with a poisoned dagger. But it wasn't poisoned. The stuff looked to
  me like alcohol. I suppose she was no such fool as to take a chance with
  poison, knowing I might get a scratch with the thing. I laid odds she didn't
  want me murdered&mdash;not in her house. <i>They</i> wanted police passes.
  <i>She</i> wanted me knocked out. They won both bets. I suppose it's reckoned
  easier to hypnotise a man when he's out from a blow on the head. If I had
  questioned her about that golden figurine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"It was too obviously set to attract my attention, so I shied oft, hoping
  she would make a break about it. But it's difficult to make a woman lead
  trumps. I believe the thing was gold. If you know what I mean by
  pre-Egyptian, I should say it was all that. I never saw anything like it in
  any museum. It was exactly the same color as that box or whatever it is you
  showed me. It looked as if it had been smoothed by a million hands for a
  million years. Its face was&mdash;damned if I can tell you. Elemental is the
  only word I can think of. I've seen something rather like it in dreams.
  Pretty hair-raising. Nothing decent about it&mdash;except the skill; it was
  marvelous molding. It wasn't Indian, I'll swear that."</p>

  <p>"She said nothing at all about it?"</p>

  <p>"No. Sent it out of the room with the dagger, perhaps to increase my
  curiosity: she must have known I'd notice it. When I get in the train I'll
  try to draw a picture of the thing from memory and post it back to you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, do that. Are you absolutely sure Chetusingh walked out alone?"</p>

  <p>"No. I heard him pass along the corridor. He made a signal. It's a special
  one he and I invented. Wu Tu bragged about having corrupted him. She may have
  done it. Govind Singh took money from her."</p>

  <p>"You saw that?"</p>

  <p>"Two one-hundred rupee notes. And Govind Singh's one of our old
  reliables."</p>

  <p>The commissioner grinned. "Yes, I think I can depend on Govind Singh. Wu
  Tu doesn't tip for nothing, even in a tight place. But police secrets are
  like stable-secrets; you can't check 'em. Govind Singh will tell her the
  police are hot-foot after Zaman Ali and his friends&mdash;and that you've
  been hurried off to Rajputana. Give 'em what they want. I always do it. Your
  taking a train six stations up the line will make 'em think we're trying to
  keep your movements secret. Obvious secrecy is the best decoy in the world.
  You're a decoy. Remember it."</p>

  <p>The car's long shadow flitted monstrously through suburbs, where the dust
  lay thick on sunlit mango trees and the smoke of a million dung-cakes
  sharpened the scent of the stirring countryside. There was nearly a crash.
  The Sikh drove roaring between two bullock carts. A rising camel missed
  Nirvana by the width of a ray of sunshine on his mangy hide. But. all that
  vanished in a cloud of dust and neither the Sikh nor his passengers batted an
  eyelid. They sat in silence. It was the Sikh's job anyhow.</p>

  <p>"A crime that includes David Frensham and his daughter isn't ordinary,"
  the commissioner said at last. "Zaman Ali sold his string of horses at a
  loss&mdash;let 'em go for a song. That means something else pays him better
  than horses. Treasure? Remember, he has been dealing in bullion and spending
  money remarkably freely for him. So has Wu Tu dealt in bullion. Taron Ling
  has bolted as I hoped."</p>

  <p>"Lost him?" Blair asked.</p>

  <p>"For the moment. We'll catch him. And so Wu Tu wants you to make love to
  Henrietta? Always give 'em what they want, Blair!"</p>

  <p>"Damn her eyes. How does she know about me and Henrietta? Who told?"</p>

  <p>"It was pretty well bruited around, six months ago, that you and Henrietta
  were as good as engaged. Wu Tu gets all the gossip."</p>

  <p>Blair scowled. "It was my fault. I wish I'd pulled out sooner. Truth is.
  Henrietta acted damned well and it never dawned on me, until too late, that
  she was getting romantic. I treated her damned badly."</p>

  <p>The commissioner tried to smoke, but the wind spoiled the cigar so he
  threw it away.</p>

  <p>"Did I tell you she's my god-child?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you mentioned it." Blair spotted the sideways glance from under the
  gray eyebrows. He neither avoided nor met it. "Is that like vaccination? I
  mean&mdash;" Then he suddenly met the commissioner's eyes as straight and
  hard as point engages point in duel. "What does that protect her from?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. But it makes me sentimental. I suspect her. You're to make love
  if you have to. I hate it."</p>

  <p>"I won't do it," Blair answered. "I'd a lot rather go to hell."</p>

  <p>"That's why you're going. It's your privilege perhaps to save her from a
  bad mess. I suspect we're on the track of something more than ordinarily
  deadly, as well as mysterious, so don't go off half-cocked. Information, yes;
  proof, yes; fireworks, no! Take your time and get your evidence. I'll watch
  Wu Tu. If she doesn't bolt, I'll do something to scare her out. Nothing like
  getting 'em moving."</p>

  <p>They approached a wayside station. A short, special freight train, that
  had happened to be going north from that station with government stores, had
  been caught by telephone. It waited in the station siding with an
  old-fashioned passenger coach attached. Porters pounced on Blair's bedding,
  steel trunk, rifle-case and two or three small packages. The commissioner
  smiled:</p>

  <p>"Bear in mind that David Frensham, just before he disappeared, was
  curiously interested in the difference between sun- and moon-light. It was
  one of his crazes."</p>

  <p>Blair shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"And remember that the East has always dreaded moon-light. It's supposed
  not only to madden lovers. David Frensham seriously believed it has
  mysterious qualities that sunshine hasn't."</p>

  <p>"Damn all moonshine!" Blair climbed into the train and they shook hands
  through the window.</p>

  <p>"If my suspicions are right," said the commissioner, "File FF should get
  some interesting additions."</p>

  <p>"To hell with FF!"</p>

  <p>"Quite right. It's a bloody nuisance. It disturbs a fellow's trust in
  Hoyle and Culbertson. So keep your hair on. Walk into anything whatever that
  looks like a trap, and trust me to keep you in sight. We'll be close behind
  you. Good-by. Good luck!"</p>

  <p>The engine seethed and clamored. An impatient Eurasian station-master with
  his watch ill his hand kicked at a sleeping cur and made it yelp to call
  attention to himself; the commissioner nodded to him and he blew his
  whistle.</p>

  <p>The train started.</p>

  <p>There was no ice&mdash;no comfort. The engine grumbled along a track that
  resembled an aching steel nerve, toward a heat-haze bounded only by infinity.
  The commissioner's car sped away in a dust cloud of its own, toward the
  smoke-stacks which fringe the hot crucible of human emotions known on the
  maps as Bombay City.</p>

  <p>When Blair Warrender stepped from the train at Abu Road, it was into the
  dazzling glare of Rajasthan. He loved it. It was a land after his own
  heart&mdash;a land of anger and good manners. Conquered times out of number,
  its conquered, like the English Saxons, always forced new masters and new
  chivalry to bloom and live by glory or be damned.</p>

  <p>Warrender's great-grandfather had fought under Arthur Wellesley. He was
  the grandson of a gunner officer who died on the Ridge in '57. His uncle had
  led a squadron of Indian cavalry to Kabul and was mentioned in despatches by
  "Bobs" of Kandahar. So he was unlikely to lack what he needed in that land,
  where even a peasant usually, traces his descent from warriors who looted and
  fought ere history was written.</p>

  <p>A rajah, whose royal lineage was already ancient when the gods (so says
  the legend) walked on earth with men, provided too many ponies and too much
  camp equipment. A <i>zemindar</i> lent servants to whom such service is
  traditional privilege, a trifle arrogantly seized and quarrelsomely held, but
  rendered feudally and with alertness to observe all reasons why such duties
  are a source of pride.</p>

  <p>The encampments, night after night for five nights, were a rendezvous for
  veterans who had served before Blair Warrender saw daylight, under men whose
  graves had strewn the long length of the North-West Frontier. There were
  tales and songs by fire&mdash;and moonlight, and the days were a procession
  of wayside courtesies. Until one evening Blair pitched near Doongar, where
  the jungle heaves at the foot of Gaglajung, amid hills like the humps of
  camels.</p>

  <p>Abdurrahman Khan&mdash;Moslem <i>Zemindar</i> of Hindu acres, and as part
  and parcel of them as ever a Norman landlord was on Saxon soil &mdash;sat
  gray and dignified on a camp-stool under the awning of Blair's big tent. He
  reached out a hand such as El Greco painted, for the rifle that Blair's
  borrowed gun-bearer was cleaning. His own sabre, brought in honor of the
  occasion, lay bright and legendary-looking on the knees of a grandson
  squatting near him. He examined the rifle and then handed it back.</p>

  <p>"In my day," he remarked, "I have seen much that was new, which seemed
  good. But by Allah (blessings on His Prophet!) it was forth from a man that
  goodness came. And not always was it goodness! As a man's heart are his
  weapons."</p>

  <p>Blair merely nodded, watching the Indian night, dark, swift, splendid,
  deepen on jungle and hills. Such information as he sought lurks, shy of
  argument. It creeps forth like the jungle dwellers in the stillness. Royal
  Rajasthan drew on her starlit cloak, which is a conjurer of moods. He awaited
  a mood of indiscretion. In front, a mile away, the ruined keep of
  Gaglajung&mdash;shadowy fangs on a dark crag&mdash;told of the days when men
  of action struck such blows on time that the reverberations still make songs
  on the lips of minstrels. Such history lives in the night. It could be felt,
  like the smells in the dew that the animals observe and understand.</p>

  <p>"By God, we need more <i>chota sahibs</i>," the old Rangar grumbled. He
  had talked mere politics for an hour. "There were never enough of those young
  brass-gutted Britons. They rode hard and died laughing at mysteries. They
  understood not much except how to be men, but that was plenty. They served
  for us to form on and to follow, and by God, we did it. But to-day whom shall
  the men with stout hearts follow? Babus? Nowadays the sahibs have to wait on
  babu's orders. As for the police&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was coming. Blair did not betray that he was waiting for it. He watched
  the rise of the moon, almost full, beyond Gaglajung. It suffused night with
  amber mystery&mdash;that secret stuff of which songs are woven, and music,
  and tales of gods and men. The passionate beauty and silence of the scene
  would have been almost unendurable but for the old Rangar's croaking:</p>

  <p>"I am old. My day is done. But I know man from woman. He, camped yonder,
  is a woman. He is too much wifed. He looks up regulations in a book. He
  hesitates, instead of knowing what he knows and. by God, leaving what he does
  not know to give God exercise. He has another woman with him who could make
  two men of one husband. But he is married to a wife who makes two women of
  him."</p>

  <p>Blair said nothing. For a minute or two the old Rangar meditated, until
  out of the distant silences there came a cough, half roar, half grunt. The
  obscene voice of Kol-Bhalu, the jackal who follows tigers, answered. Then,
  for a sudden moment, even the insects were still, and Blair glanced at his
  rifle.</p>

  <p>"Time enough yet," said the Rangar. "Grayne sahib won't leave a book to
  spoil our sport. To-night is our night. Such as he is, put off danger until
  tomorrow, and then give the order to build a <i>machan</i> in a safe place
  such as books recommend. Wah! A father of tigers, this one. Some name him,
  saying also that Kol Bhalu. who dogs him, is the spirit of a money-lender
  whom he slew last year&mdash;aye, and devoured. Since then he has slain seven
  men. He has grown cunning: he is not to be taken in traps. But the watchers
  are out. The stops are well placed. He will slake his thirst at one of three
  pools, and then he will find all roads closed against him, except this one,
  by the charcoal-burners' <i>ghat</i>, toward us. He will come near midnight.
  . . . I was speaking of women."</p>

  <p>"Speak on."</p>

  <p>"Frennisham. her name is&mdash;daughter to the Brigadier Bahadur who they
  say is missing. What she does here is a mystery, save that she visits the
  Graynes; and them she uses as it suits her. She is without fear and she runs
  uncommon risks&mdash;wanders these hills all alone, on a pony or on foot as
  the spirit moves her &mdash;and by night, too. Hers is a restless spirit. She
  should be the mother of good fighting men. She knows the ancient songs of
  Rajasthan&mdash; aye, and the dances&mdash;teaches them to the children, who
  were better without such superstitious stuff. She has slept more than once in
  a villager's hut&mdash;forever questioning&mdash;forever seeking something,
  none unless it be the Bat-Brahmin, knows what. They tell strange tales about
  him and her."</p>

  <p>Blair met the old Rangar's gaze for a moment.</p>

  <p>"It is a land of strange tales." he answered. Then he stared again at the
  ruined keep of Gaglajung, now reddish amid soot-dark shadows. Where the moon
  shone through gaps of broken masonry imagination refused to believe there was
  not living flame. He spoke unexpectedly:</p>

  <p>"Tell me the story of that place." Old tales beget true confidences.
  Questions about Henrietta Frensham would have stanched the flow of truth by
  suggesting curiosity, which makes the eastern mind evasive.</p>

  <p>The Rangar, well pleased, cleared his throat. His grandson, with the sword
  across his knees, hitherto as motionless as a moonlit carving, leaned forward
  to listen. His eyes obeyed the gesture of the old man's right hand pointing
  toward Gaglajung.</p>

  <p>"Your honor knows the ballad about Ranjeet of the Ford? Yonder the ford
  lies&mdash;this side of Doongar Village, between us and Grayne sahib's camp.
  That castle commanded the ford in the old days. It was Ranjeet Singh's. None
  could burn him out of it, and lie was known as Ranjeet of the Ford&mdash;a
  wonder of a man, who swore to.have his will of life up yonder and not die at
  all but leave earth in a way more pleasing. It befell otherwise. She who died
  last in that place, is&mdash;men say so&mdash;there yet. Some say they have
  seen her."</p>

  <p>"Have <i>you</i> seen her?" Blair asked.</p>

  <p>The old man stared, but Blair was looking at the night. Only the grandson
  betrayed excitement; he leaned farther forward. The Rangar continued:</p>

  <p>"I have seen and heard strange things in my day. God's truth is what
  matters. She of whom I speak was known by a name, that means Queen of the
  Moon. It was not hers in the beginning. All astrologers are liars, saith the
  Prophet. I believe in none of their abominations. Nevertheless, they say that
  certain stars, when seen together near the moon, mean love and war in
  wondrous combinations, and an ill end.</p>

  <p>"Ranjeet Singh desired her. His will was law. He stole her from her
  father's hold by Abu, after three years' fighting. It is said that as he bore
  her home lie saw two stars beside the moon reflected in the ford, when he
  paused to water his horse. She, his prisoner, still hating him, he gazed into
  her eyes and renamed her Queen of the Moon, From that hour they two loved
  each other.</p>

  <p>"Great was her love for him. The minstrels sing of it. They say she
  learned secrets that only the Brahmins know. And some say she did what
  Ranjeet of the Ford did not escaped death. But such is the talk of idolaters,
  and may the curses of the Prophet rest on such abomination. So much Ranjeet
  loved her that he rode unwillingly when his plighted words compelled him to
  take up arms again. He was summoned afar off, to the aid of a Prince who had
  once befriended him. In such matters no Rajput is his own master. He obeys
  his oath, no matter to whom he pledged it. Ranjeet rode forth, vowing not to
  come back save with honor.</p>

  <p>"Her honor and his were one. She swore&mdash; for in those days they were
  <i>women</i>&mdash;she would hold that crag of his until he should return
  victorious, or unto death and forever. She and her women, and boys and old
  men were the garrison when Ranjeet led all his warriors away to aid a friend
  in need. More than one king slept ill at ease then, thinking how "she might
  be had for the taking. By Allah, she was worth a campaign if there is truth
  in a tenth of the tales of her! Queen of the Moon men called her, and they
  said she knew great secrets. Three kings laid siege to that fortress yonder.
  They agreed between them that the first to storm the battlements should,have
  her, and her secrets also, but the other plunder should be equally
  divided.</p>

  <p>"They plucked the uncaught eagle. She and her women held that height so
  stubbornly that on this countryside to-day we say of a vainglorious boaster
  'he taketh Gaglajung.' In armor, she led all sorties. She and her women held
  the breaches in the walls, while boys and old men toiled at the repairs. They
  said she knew the secrets of the Moon and that the Moon-god and the gods of
  day and night were all her servants. But there came a herald from the three
  kings, saying Ranjeet Singh, defeated, on his way home, had been taken
  prisoner. He was the prisoner of the three kings.</p>

  <p>"In a fetter to her, he bade her yield, as. the price of his freedom. The
  three kings were casting lots for her when the herald brought back her
  answer, saying she believed no word of it, well knowing that Ranjeet Singh,
  her lord, was a man to whom honor and life were one, whereas the writer of
  that letter was without honor, like unto themselves. But Ranjeet was unworthy
  of her.</p>

  <p>"The three kings set Ranjeet Singh arrayed in armor on a horse, and showed
  him to her. Then again they sent the herald. He returned again answering,
  'Nay, it is not he, because where is his honor?'</p>

  <p>"Then, it is said, they tortured Ranjeet Singh, and he betrayed a hidden
  passage. That night they assaulted&mdash;all three kings with all their
  strength, from three sides and by the secret passage also. By Allah, they had
  light to see by! She burned the place. She and her women died in that
  furnace. But some say&mdash;may the lie blister their throats!&mdash;that she
  died not at all. It was full moon."</p>

  <p>"What had that to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"I know not. But they say that at full moon she walks the battlements and
  waits there yet for Ranjeet Singh to come with honor. Some say they have seen
  her spirit. As for me, I am a Sufi, and I think a man may inquire about life
  and death. But not too idly&mdash;nay, nor listen to such tales as that.</p>

  <p>"The three kings slew Ranjeet Singh. Despising him, they put him in a
  tiger's cage. When he was devoured they let the tiger go, declaring the brute
  had done well. Thus sprang the legend that Ranjeet Singh incarnates in a
  tiger. A foolish legend, but men believe it. Look, sahib&mdash;nay, yonder,
  to the left a little."</p>

  <p>Far off, probably a mile away, or more, a little yellow light moved slowly
  up and down, then vanished.</p>

  <p>"He is coming," said the Rangar. "Ranjeet Singh, the superstitious call
  him. And they say. Slay him ever so often, ever he is reborn. They say he
  must prowl in that shape until she shall descend from Gaglajung and forgive
  him. Who knows? I am against all superstition. But I have heard wilder tales
  than that."</p>

  <p>Blair got up and examined the breach of his rifle. The Rangar was old and
  the boy young, so that neither had part in the hunt. Blair followed a lean,
  loose-limbed shikarri, along the dry bed of a watercourse for upward of a
  mile, until they reached a bend where moonlight formed an amber pool at the
  foot of a huge rock. The shadow of the rock struck forward into that pool of
  light. Beyond, the dry watercourse entered a dark gorge with jungle-clad
  walls. To the right, beyond the rock, a smaller, stone-strewn watercourse
  descended from Gaglajung in shadowy zigzags, reaching the dry pool amid
  boulders beside a gnarled tree.</p>

  <p>The shikarri whispered, "When he has killed, sahib, he goes by that way,
  up the flank of Gaglajung, where he dens in a cavern. But to-night he has not
  killed. He is angry."</p>

  <p>So was Blair angry. What the devil was Henrietta doing, wandering about
  that countryside? He took his stand with his back to the rock, in soot-black
  shadow, motionless. The shikarri crouched near him behind a boulder. There
  were sounds not far off. Twigs snapped. A jackal yelled homeless anguish.
  Silence returned, heavy and as solid as the darkness of the breathless
  jungle. For twenty minutes night, time, silence and suspense all brooded
  peril, forefelt, until human nature yielded to the strain and time dimmed
  imagination. A heavy, sullen sounding footfall came at last like a sound in a
  dream. The shikarri whispered:</p>

  <p><i>"Bagh hai!"</i></p>

  <p>Gray in the dimness, as sudden as if evolved out of eternity that moment,
  a tiger stood ghostly and vague in the throat of the gorge&mdash;motionless.
  The moonlight shone pale on his eyes. His head was flat with back-laid ears.
  He heard a sound behind him, wheeled and vanished.</p>

  <p>Two minutes passed&mdash;two eternities. then he stood there again, in the
  same spot, couching his weight between his shoulders. Murderous eyes that saw
  Blair Warrender could not interpret what they saw. They awaited motion; he
  made none; he and his rifle were one still shadow, within a darkness. On the
  flank of the gorge in the dark a twig snapped sharply. The tiger vanished
  like a shadow, nowither. He was simply not there. Three minutes, by Blair
  Warrender's pulse-beat. Then, out of the stillness behind the boulder on his
  right hand, the shikarri's tongue clucked on his cheek. That sound might mean
  anything, but certainly not nothing, from that shikarri. Warrender spared him
  a glance, but his eyes made only half the circuit; they were arrested midway
  by a shadow moving on the bed of the smaller watercourse. There was no
  sound.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the tiger muttered&mdash;coughed&mdash; roared&mdash;three sounds
  from three directions. He had made a circuit of the moonlight and lay
  crouching somewhere to the left, opposite the smaller watercourse. He could
  not be twenty paces away. His eyes became visible, nothing else. He appeared
  to be watching that new shadow that had set the shikarri's warning tongue in
  motion. There was sixty seconds' silence. Then he crept out into moonlight,
  tense, with his weight low, crouching for the rush that bears home spastic
  death on fang and claw.</p>

  <p>Blair Warrender and his rifle became one entity. Flash, crack, echo were
  inseparable from the roaring snarl of anger as the tiger tell biting the
  wound that stung him, rolled into the shadow of a rock, recovered and then
  rushed at the throat of the smaller watercourse.</p>

  <p>A shot followed&mdash;hit him&mdash;hit hard. He roared and turned to face
  the enemy. A third shot rolled him over and he lay still, except that his
  claws tore the sand, anger surviving death by fifty spasms.</p>

  <p>The shikarri began tossing pebbles, keeping the advantage of the boulder.
  There were sounds all around in the dark, but no one showed himself, not even
  when Blair reloaded and stepped out into the moonlight. A retreating jackal
  whimpered the tiger's requiem, obscene and ribald.</p>

  <p>"Three shots?" said a woman's voice. The shadow lengthened in the throat
  of the smaller watercourse. There was a sound of footsteps, rubbered, on
  smooth rock. "Is it Ranjeet Singh or just an ordinary tiger?"</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are!" Blair answered. He had seen too many dead tigers
  come to life to take unnecessary risks. He hurled a big stone at the carcass,
  then went close and prodded with the end of his rifle-barrel. "Yes," he said,
  "three shots. Is it Henrietta?"</p>

  <p>She sprang to a small boulder and stood in full moonlight with her hands
  behind her, wearing no hat. Wavy, blond hair that looked like spun gold hid
  her face in shadow. There was an edge, like an aura, of moonlight that,
  revealed her figure outlined under a smock of some flimsy material.</p>

  <p>"Is it Ranjeet Singh?" she repeated.</p>

  <p>Anger hardened Blair's voice. "What are you doing here at midnight?"</p>

  <p>She leaped to the ground and walked toward him. with her back to the moon,
  until her shadow fell on the tiger. Her face was still almost invisible. She
  was tall, and she stood with the natural grace of a well-bred Rajput woman of
  the hills. She might be one &mdash;almost.</p>

  <p>"Is he quite dead? Well, he deserved it. Poor old Ranjeet Singh! You know
  the legend?"</p>

  <p>She knelt. With strong weather-brown fingers she tried to close the
  tiger's staring eyes.</p>

  <p>"He's a man-eater." said Blair. "He might have got you.
  Tigers&mdash;snakes&mdash;leopards&mdash;don't you know better than&mdash;"
  She stood up. He could see her face
  now&mdash;good-humored&mdash;half-mocking. It made him hesitate.
  Pain&mdash;or it might be anger&mdash;underlay the humor. "&mdash;Any
  better," he repeated, "than to take such chances&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why should you care?" she answered. He could almost see the color of her
  eyes. "Blair, do you know what chance is?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, Henrietta?" he said stiffly.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't ask. I know the answer." She set her foot on the tiger's
  head. "If you knew, you wouldn't be on Wu Tu's list of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of what?"</p>

  <p>"Wu Tu's sucker-list!"</p>

  <p>She turned from him, knelt and with her fingers bared the tiger's
  fangs.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Ranjeet Singh," she said. "You were another bold and clever one
  who lost out, weren't you?"</p>

  <p>Then the Rangar came, leaning on his grandson's shoulder, and in a moment
  the pool of moonlight swarmed with men who emerged like ghosts from
  nowhere.</p>

  <p class="quote">Knowledge? Ye know nothing, save ye do it without thinking.
  Thought is the swamp of ignorance surrounding Knowledge. All must cross that.
  Build no stronghold on it, that will sink and become a hopeless dungeon,
  difficult to leave.</p>

  <p class="quote">&mdash;From the Ninth (unfinished) Book of Noor Ali.</p><br>

  <p class="first">SOMEONE who looked like a Bat-Brahmin, ragged, arrogating
  privilege but insolently careless of its obligations, spat pan-juice from a
  shadow and spoke oracularly. The old Rangar gave orders, appearing to ignore
  the Bat's existence, but his feudal dignity masked experienced respect for
  something older than feudalism, deeper than logic. He approached Blair:</p>

  <p>"If your honor permits, it is wise to observe a superstition if it does no
  harm. Trust me to see no whiskers are stolen. She"&mdash;he glanced at
  Henrietta Frensham&mdash;"need not watch, but she should stay near. Let them
  say the ghost of Ranjeet Singh is at rest."</p>

  <p>Blair nodded. He watched the lean shikarri pull an oiled rag through the
  rifle-barrel. Then he strode over to Henrietta Frensham and sat beside her on
  a rock in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>"Will you wait while they skin him?"he asked. "I'll send for ponies
  afterward and see you back to camp."</p>

  <p>"Why? Is that necessary?"</p>

  <p>"I intend to tell Grayne while I'm here about it&mdash;what I think of his
  letting you roam these hills at night."</p>

  <p>"Is it your business? What are you doing here?" she retorted.</p>

  <p>Blair looked straight in front of him. The men around the tiger's carcass,
  twenty feet away, resembled ghouls at a graveyard feast of flesh. He hardly
  saw them. He was aware of&mdash;could almost feel Henrietta's Frensham's eyes
  studying him. They were violet. Her hair was straw-gold. She held one knee
  clasped in her hands, and he knew her expression, brave but vaguely mystic,
  as if she expected events that she. would endure uncomplainingly for
  inscrutable ends.</p>

  <p>He knew all that without looking. Without even closing his own eyes he
  could see hers&mdash; much more clearly, in fact, than if he looked straight
  at her in moonlight dimness. 'But that was natural; he could have drawn her
  face" easily from memory. What irritated him was Wu Tu's eyes, behind hers,
  seeming to look through them. He decided he had to be brutal and get
  questions over with.</p>

  <p>"Where is your father?" he demanded. He looked suddenly straight at her.
  She betrayed no surprise, but said nothing. "That's why I'm here," he added,
  "to find out."</p>

  <p>"No other reason?"</p>

  <p>Silence. He hated what he had to do, and saw no reason to make a secret of
  that, but he had not come to answer questions. He ground his heel into the
  gravel, well aware she was as tense as he was, but was hiding it better. He
  governed his voice and spoke calmly:</p>

  <p>"I've been sent here to ask things, Henrietta. Please answer. What do you
  know about Wu Tu?"</p>

  <p>He did not look at her that time. He preferred to give her a chance to
  collect her thoughts. He could see Wu Tu's eyes in the dark, and that made
  him, and kept him, angry. He needed anger, and he was not in the least afraid
  of Wu Tu's influence. Any number of people can work that trick of impressing
  mental pictures. Wu Tu's would wear off. In the meantime it kept him alert
  and made cruelty easier. He added, "You're not accused of anything. I'll not
  humiliate you if I can help it."</p>

  <p>"No?" she answered. "All I actually know of Wu Tu is that you and she
  completed my humiliation. She turned you against me in less than a week. Then
  she offered you back to me &mdash;on her terms. Blair, I would have believed
  almost absolutely anything sooner than that you are like that."</p>

  <p>"Like what?"</p>

  <p>"Someone whom Wu Tu can take and can give."</p>

  <p>Their eyes met, and hers were truthful. She was saying what she believed,
  that she was ashamed to be forced to believe. It suddenly occurred to him to
  tell her the moonlight made her look nearly naked in that thin smock; but he
  did not say it, although he would have in other circumstances. She was the
  only woman who ever had almost seemed more desirable to him than his job. He
  wondered why, staring at her in silence; until he realized that the nakedness
  was not really physical but the effect of emotion, hers and his. She was not.
  even trying to hide hers.</p>

  <p>"You're entitled to know the truth about that," he said. "I'll explain, if
  you wish."</p>

  <p>"Officially? Or am I to believe it?"</p>

  <p>He tried, to take her hand, but she drew it away.</p>

  <p>"I will believe you, Blair. I can bear to hear anything. You needn't
  pretend what you don't feel."</p>

  <p>"Wu Tu had nothing to do with it, Henrietta. I left off, because I didn't
  dare to fall in love with you."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you dare? I was in love with you. I admit it."</p>

  <p>"I knew that."</p>

  <p>"I meant you should know it. You ran."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You behaved like Ranjeet Singh in the legend. In the beginning I hated
  you, so much that I had to think about you. So I did think, Blair, when we
  met in the dark that night in Bombay and you took my wrist&mdash;not my hand,
  my wrist&mdash;you remember?&mdash;and dragged me, unwillingly, to look at an
  almost naked fakir, who resembled a bas-relief against velvet darkness with
  the firelight dancing on him, then I knew I loved you. I don't know why. I
  couldn't reason that out. I just knew it. I was fool enough to think you
  loved me. When you went away so suddenly, you said on duty, I supposed your
  job made you silent. I thought it was the quietness of strength. I was
  impatient, but thoroughly happy to wait. Then Wu Tu came."</p>

  <p>"To the house?"</p>

  <p>"A police constable, of all people, brought a note from her, saying she
  had important information from you. If anyone but a policeman had brought it,
  I would probably have ignored it. I had heard of her of course; everyone has.
  Knowing you have to use all sorts of people in curious ways, I made an
  appointment to meet her in my tent at the end of the garden. She came by the
  back entrance, and I kept her waiting because I felt vaguely afraid. She made
  astonishing offers&mdash; money&mdash;then, that minute&mdash;quantities of
  money&mdash;showed it to me&mdash;tried to force it on me."</p>

  <p>"What did she want you to do?"</p>

  <p>"Betray my father. I refused and she threatened. I've no idea how she knew
  about you and me, but she said she would deprive me of you, just so that she
  and I might understand each other. That sounded so incredibly ridiculous that
  I laughed. But when she was gone&mdash;it was too hot to go indoors&mdash;I
  sat there all alone and felt ill with dread. And you only wrote once, you
  remember&mdash;curtly&mdash;formally."</p>

  <p>"I wrote twice."</p>

  <p>"I received one. letter."</p>

  <p>"Go on. I'm listening."</p>

  <p>"Wu Tu came again. It seemed cowardly to refuse to see her. And besides, I
  was wretched and wanted to know. She said she would give you back to me, if I
  would be sensible, as she expressed it. She seemed to know all about
  you&mdash;for instance, how you have nothing beyond your pay. She even knew
  where you were born, and where you went to school, and the name of.a girl in
  England who inherited a hundred thousand pounds and wrote you
  love-letters.</p>

  <p>"Then she named some important people whom she hinted she had put where
  they are through her secret influence. And she offered to show me how to make
  yours a real career, with orders and decorations and I don't know what else.
  She made politics and promotion and all that kind of thing sound like a
  filthy swindle, with a few innocent figureheads manipulated from behind the
  scenes by blackguards. And she said you know all that, but that you lack the
  sublety and need a woman to awaken something in you. I might have you back if
  I would promise to give her my confidence."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Blair said. "I'm listening."</p>

  <p>"I almost did promise. I thought I might save you from her."</p>

  <p>He waited. His eyes smoldered. But they changed, and he looked relieved
  when she laughed a bit bitterly at her own conceit and added, "But I saw you
  would have to save yourself. I couldn't do it. It was like this legend of
  Ranjeet Singh, although I didn't know the legend then. To yield myself would
  not have cleaned you."</p>

  <p>"Cleaned?" he said. He got up and strode to where they were skinning the
  tiger. It was a slow job. They were not particularly expert, and they were
  taking great pains not to damage the skin. The old Rangar was arguing with
  the Bat-Brahmin in a shadow, and the shikarri who, for some reason, had not
  been allowed to touch the carcass, was looking on, scornfully. Blair sent the
  shikarri hotfoot to his camp for cigarettes and then, himself in shadow,
  stared at Henrietta. She looked lovely in that moonlight. The sight of her
  made his arms tremble. He loathed his job more than ever. It would have been
  so simple to go and make love to her. She would tell him anything he asked,
  if&mdash;</p>

  <p>He strode back, feeling and looking ruthless. He stood in front of her
  with his face in moonlight. She said. "Don't look like that, Blair. You're
  not cynical. You feel as badly as I do, or you should."</p>

  <p>"I told you I'd explain," he answered. "Wu Tu had nothing to do with it,
  Henrietta. I wrote twice. The second one was a rotten letter to have to
  write, but you'd have understood. I said honestly that I wasn't in love. Wu
  Tu may have stolen that second letter. She's capable of it. If so, she simply
  took advantage of information. She's an opportunist, and she's rather clever.
  That's the truth&mdash;or as much as I can tell you; I can't betray official
  secrets."</p>

  <p>"But you question me like a culprit."</p>

  <p>"No, no, not a culprit. If you'd rather, I'll wait till daylight."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, let's not evade it," she objected. "I've been up there on
  Gaglajung, imagining myself waiting for Ranjeet Singh to return with
  honor&mdash;being silly and romantic&mdash;wallowing in sorrow. I knew you
  were here, so I came down. I'm in a mood for anything. Absolutely anything,"
  she added, "except&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Except what?"</p>

  <p>"Lies."</p>

  <p>"Will you answer three questions?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Where's your father?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Where did you get that gold box that was stolen from your bedroom?"</p>

  <p>"Father locked it in' my suitcase. I didn't know it was. missing until I
  noticed the lock of the suitcase was broken."</p>

  <p>"Where did <i>he</i> get it?"</p>

  <p>"He found it."</p>

  <p>"Have you heard from your father?"</p>

  <p>No answer. Suddenly: "Wu Tu told me you have been in love with her for
  ever so long."</p>

  <p>"You believe that?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I don't care."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a lie. Look here, Henrietta, you and I had better face this.
  You're under suspicion."</p>

  <p>"What of? You suspect me?"</p>

  <p>"To a certain extent, yes. I always did. You're a mystery, but it seemed
  like sacrilege to try to question you."</p>

  <p>"Sacrilege? You?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I couldn't fall in love and mistrust you at the same time. So I ran
  out. I'm not making love now, so don't be afraid. I'm friendly."</p>

  <p>"Is that quite true?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is. But you're as baffling as ever. You never once revealed your
  real thought."</p>

  <p>"Blair, I wanted to have no reserve from you. i wanted to be able to tell
  you anything you care to ask."</p>

  <p>"Tell me now."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>The monosyllable was like the thump of a; door shut quietly. He watched
  her, speaking: slowly: "Zaman Ali and a bad gang&mdash;Wu Tu and a worse
  gang&mdash;Dur-i-Duran Singh of Naga Kulu, and certain others are suspected
  of being concerned in your father's disappearance. Wu Tu possesses a golden
  figurine that may: come from the same source as the box you lost. We have
  your box. I've seen it. You're here, behaving curiously, to put it mildly. In
  plain words, you're here looking for something. And you've troubled yourself
  to charm Grayne and to.mystify him until he lets you do just as you
  please."</p>

  <p>"So you've been spying on me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered. "Who is the villager in whose house you slept?"</p>

  <p>"You can easily find him."</p>

  <p>"I will. What have you been doing up on Gaglajung, in addition to making
  villagers believe you're a ghost?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you think you're a bit ridiculous?" she retorted.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "I feel ridiculous, and I hate what I'm doing. But, you
  see, I want your answer."</p>

  <p>"There is none."</p>

  <p>"Take your time, Henrietta, and think. If you don't, you may force me
  to&mdash;well, I won't discuss that."</p>

  <p>"I have thought. There is no answer."</p>

  <p>"May I search your tent?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>In the darkness a man with a little bagpipe began blaring a tune. Several
  men lit torches. Two men took the tiger-skin and bore it between them toward
  Henrietta, thrusting the head forward for her fingers to touch. She
  understood what they wished. She stood up and laid her right hand between the
  pugnacious ears, speaking in Rajasthani:</p>

  <p>"Be this then the end of Ranjeet Singh. He is forgiven."</p>

  <p>The old Rangar, coughing to hide embarrassment, stood forward, bowing: "If
  the presence will&mdash;there is a little thing&mdash;it is not far&mdash;I
  am ashamed of these superstitious people, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" She stepped forward. The Bat-Brahmin seized a torch from a man
  and shook it. The bagpipe blared and the Bat led forward to the dark gorge,
  singing the ballad of Ranjeet of the Ford. And the crowd that had grown to
  forty or fifty people trailed along behind, excited, singing through their
  noses.</p>

  <p>It was nothing incomprehensible to them that Henrietta Frensham should be
  a brigadier-general's daughter, and a ghost, and a reincarnation of Ranjeet,
  Singh's self-immolated widow, all at the same time. There was a god in the
  jungle who knew all about it, so they did the pleasantly discreet thing, and
  walked in procession to put streaky paint, sweet oil and cow-pats on his
  image. It was magic, which has nothing to do with ascertainable or concrete
  fact, and does not call for explanation.</p>

  <p>Night in the throat of the gorge grew crimson with the torch-flare that
  glittered on frightened wild eyes amid rocks and undergrowth. They climbed a
  well-worn path, disturbing sleeping birds, until the trees ceased and
  they.were again in moonlight on the lap of a flank of Gaglajung. There the
  shrine nestled&mdash;a mere godlet's nest of white stone under one lone tree,
  where the bats wove tapestry for unseen powers of the night. A monstrous wall
  of rock, outleaning like a man's breast, loomed, pale in moonlight, and
  spread downward toward the jungle.</p>

  <p>Peace breathed fragrance. An old hermit, gray-haired and gray-bearded,
  mild-eyed, mad and friendly, came forth from the shrine and looked on. Two
  young women suddenly appeared where nothing except darkness had been. Night,
  it had seemed, created them with strings of heavy-scented garlands in their
  hands; they hung garlands around Henrietta's neck and then&mdash;impudently
  daring&mdash;around Blair's, standing on tiptoe to do it and then running
  away to hide and giggle in the darkness. Then the
  ceremony&mdash;short&mdash;casual with the smooth-worn accuracy of the
  countless years&mdash;simple, as all good ceremonies are. The hermit blessed
  the tiger-skin; the Bat-Brahmin ordered it and- then made irreverent sounds
  to disparage the hermit and call attention to himself. They all knew the
  moods of Bat-Brahmins and there was enough generous low laughter to flatter
  the man's self-esteem; the hermit's blessing was in no way qualified by that.
  The shikarri, sweating and heavy-breathing, brought the cigarettes and Blair
  gave one to Henrietta, studying her eyes by the light of the match as he held
  it in cupped hands.</p>

  <p>"My camp's not far," he said; "Suppose we walk there. After we've talked
  I'll have ponies saddled and see you back to the Graynes' camp."</p>

  <p>She nodded. Words leaped to his lips; he had hard work not to say them.
  Pagan emotion had hold of him. It moved him strangely. It was good, and he
  knew it was good. He threw away the match and lighted another as an excuse to
  turn his back. That way he regained self-control.</p>

  <p>"Come along," he said presently, forcing his voice. He did not trust
  himself to add one more word.</p>

  <p>Blair led. He was unaware that his back, and the poise of his head, and
  his shoulders, and the resolute swing of his stride in the smoky torchlight,
  pained Henrietta almost beyond endurance. The foot-track along the dry bed of
  the stream was narrow and winding; it was easier to walk one by one. To have
  followed her might have saved him the strain of imagination.</p>

  <p>To his mind's eye she seemed lovelier than she really was;, no woman could
  be quite as beautiful as he imagined her. And she seemed to him more
  defenseless than a woman of her high character possibly could be in his
  hands. He knew she loved him; she had said so. He was tremendously attracted
  to her and he was not sure he was not really in love with her.</p>

  <p>Was it true that he had behaved like Ranjeet Singh of the legend? Had he,
  even unintentionally, by his conduct, given her the right to believe he loved
  her? Probably. Had he played her false? Had he tried to buy his liberty with
  the price of her honor? He could not see how. He was going to have to be
  brutal to her now, at any rate, so he denied himself the luxury of even one
  backward glance at her. He strode like a Roman.</p>

  <p>The tent glowed with lamplight. There were two chairs under the awning,
  with a table between. He had forgotten the garlands on his shoulders; his
  servant removed those when he reached the tent. Then he turned deliberately,
  giving Henrietta time to control herself before their eyes met. Mellow
  moonlight&mdash; lamp glow&mdash;garlands, and the simple line of her
  frock&mdash;stillness and purple shadows&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Damn!" he said. "You look like a Madonna." But he used the word at
  random; she was pagan and looked like temptation itself.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, won't you? Drink? I've whisky and soda. Tea then?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>The servant put the cigarette box on the table and Blair dismissed him.
  Little groups of people standing in the shadows vanished. A pony, somewhere
  in darkness, snorted and strained at his picket; a <i>sais</i> reproved him,
  and after that there was no other noticeable sound. The stillness, that is
  made of infinitely tiny voices, waited, and the stars seemed to wait too.
  Blair's voice, when he forced himself to speak, was almost deadly
  restrained:</p>

  <p>"What's the use, Henrietta?"</p>

  <p>Her voice sounded hopeless. "Nothing's any use, Blair, not between
  us."</p>

  <p>"Anyhow, making a mystery isn't," he answered. "If you were worried about
  your father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am."</p>

  <p>"Are you? Either you know where he is, or you've heard from him, or he has
  told you not to worry and has given a reason. If not,, you'd behave
  differently. I've to find him. Is it sensible to put yourself to the damned
  indignity, and me to the indecency of having you watched? I can do that. I'd
  rather go to hell than do it."</p>

  <p>"You must do as you please."</p>

  <p>"I can't do as I please. Neither can you."</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "I know that.".</p>

  <p>"Do you realize that whatever you have in your tent, that you refused just
  now to let me see, would be known to me in detail before daylight,
  if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, why don't you? Oh, Blair, can't you understand? Are you the only
  person in the world who's loyal? And to what?" (He remembered that Wu Tu had
  said almost the same thing.) "Would you tell me any official secrets, that
  you nevertheless discuss with underlings? Would you even tell me Wu Tu's
  secrets? If you weren't a policeman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let's not <i>if</i> ourselves into a metaphysical maze," he interrupted.
  "I am a policeman. I've had easier duties than this, I don't mind telling
  you." Without changing his voice; without the slightest gesture to betray
  that he had chosen a new angle of attack, he went on:</p>

  <p>"Chetusingh"&mdash;he watched her, and her eyes revealed nothing, but the
  ends of her fingers flattened slightly on the chair-arm&mdash;"has also
  vanished."</p>

  <p>He had not even been sure that she knew Chetusingh, but he saw her guard
  go up. Her answering sarcastic smile was a moment too late: "Did you propose
  to search my tent for him?"</p>

  <p>"No," he answered; "I hadn't thought of it."</p>

  <p>She waited.</p>

  <p>He paused, very carefully selecting from the inquisition pincers.</p>

  <p>"You haven't told me," he said, "all that Wu Tu told you."</p>

  <p>"No, Blair, I haven't. Why not ask <i>her</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Why are you willing," he demanded, "to sit here and be questioned, when
  its obviously painful? You didn't have to come here with me. There were
  plenty of people up there on the hill who could have seen you safely back to
  Graynes' camp."</p>

  <p>She hesitated, thought a moment, and then answered with a smile that
  mocked her own torment:</p>

  <p>"It seemed a possible opportunity to fall out of love with you,
  Blair."</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked brutally.</p>

  <p>"I fell in."</p>

  <p>"Are you out now?"</p>

  <p>"Does it matter?"</p>

  <p>"You've no intention of telling me anything?"</p>

  <p>"Blair, it isn't you, it's the policeman I can't tell."</p>

  <p>"So you. do know."</p>

  <p>"I don't admit that."</p>

  <p>"Well, Henrietta, is isn't I, but the policeman who's asking questions.
  Personally I wouldn't probe your secrets. If I did dream of doing it because
  they're interesting and you're you, I wouldn't do it in this way. But I'm
  obliged to be impersonal and insist." "It's no use insisting&mdash;not the
  slightest use, Blair. But go on being impersonal."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"It helps me,"</p>

  <p>"You mean, if I were to put this on a personal basis you'd find it easier
  to tell me?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know? You haven't tried it. I might find it much more
  difficult to ask. I don't know what would happen."</p>

  <p>He got out of his chair and stood in front of her, holding his left wrist
  in his right hand behind his back, there being some emotions that demand more
  than mental restraint. He knew she would not resist if he should throw his
  arm around her. She was almost openly inviting him to do it. But he was one
  of those men whom temptation makes more obstinate the more it tortures. His
  shadow darkened her. Her gaze met his. Beyond or within her violet eyes he
  seemed to see Wu Tu's. He remembered what Wu Tu wanted him to do. If
  Henrietta had been any other woman&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Are there terms on which you would tell?" he demanded suddenly.</p>

  <p>"No. None." Her voice broke and he felt like a devil, so he spoke to her
  gently, not appreciating that the only merciful thing he could have done
  would have been to unleash anger and act like a cad. Then, perhaps, she might
  have ceased to love him.</p>

  <p>"You're tired," he said. "Perhaps in the morning you'll feel able to talk.
  I'll order the ponies saddled.</p>

  <p>"Not yet."</p>

  <p>He supposed she wanted time to recover self-control, so he walked to and
  fro in the moonlight, keeping his face averted each time he turned. When he
  stopped and stood in front of her again she was holding her hands before her
  eyes, but she was not sobbing.</p>

  <p>"I wish to God you weren't you," he said grimly. "If you were any other
  woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," she answered. She was dry-eyed. "If I were any other woman
  you would make love and coax me to tell what I know. I wish you had tried
  that, so that I could despise you. But you're an honorable brute. Why are you
  here, not some other man?"</p>

  <p>"Damned if I know."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you. You can no more help yourself than Pontius Pilate could.
  There are forces that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted with a gesture of anger.</p>

  <p>"See here, Henrietta. We had all that out a year ago. Your mysterious
  forces are not what I'm here to talk about. I don't believe in them. You may
  keep all those secrets. Tell me what has happened to your father."</p>

  <p>"But I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you think has happened to him."</p>

  <p>"No. You wouldn't understand me."</p>

  <p>Nothing enrages a man more than to be told that by a woman. But
  self-control was almost automatic with Blair; he answered quietly, in a
  gloved voice that had no resonance:</p>

  <p>"Very well. <i>You'll</i> have to take the consequences. You and I will
  both regret that. I'll order the ponies."</p>

  <p>She stood up: "Blair, I'd rather not ride, if you don't mind. Mayn't your
  servant see me home? I don't want to talk to you any longer. I couldn't bear
  it."</p>

  <p>"I won't talk."</p>

  <p>"I would rather go alone, but you may send as many servants as you
  please."</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right."</p>

  <p>All the servants were asleep, or pretending to sleep. None answered his
  shout. He strode savagely around the tent and awakened them&mdash;gave his
  orders&mdash;eight men and four lanterns.</p>

  <p>He did not return to Henrietta until they were all near the tent in a
  sleepy group, staring and silent.</p>

  <p>"Protection?" she asked. "So many? Or is it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They make the good-by less embarrassing." he said stiffly. "Good night.
  Henrietta. I am sorry I had to ask questions&mdash;much more sorry you didn't
  answer them."</p>

  <p>"Good night, Blair." They did not even shake hands. She walked away, two
  tall men with lanterns leading, two men on either side of her armed with
  ancient Rajput swords, and two more men with lanterns bringing up the rear.
  She looked like a prisoner, and the garlands hanging in long loops from her
  shoulders unexplainably increased the effect. Her hands, clasped behind her,
  might have been tied. Her fair hair, loose and untidy, shone where the
  moonlight sprayed its straying ends.</p>

  <p>Blair took hold of the pole of the tent awning, and his eyes followed her,
  even after she had vanished in the gloom beyond a veil of moonlit dust, until
  he realized that the pain in his hand came from squeezing the pole. Then he
  swore and sat down.</p>

  <p>He sat for two hours, almost without moving, trying to ponder the problem
  but thinking about her all the time, until the servants returned and reported
  her safe in her tent in the Graynes' camp.</p>

  <p>"Did she say anything?"</p>

  <p>"No, sahib."</p>

  <p>"No message for me? Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"No, sahib. She entered her tent and came out again to give each of us a
  little money. Then we asked permission to return hither and she nodded. It is
  your honor's pleasure that we return now to our beds?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Blair sat still, watching the purple shadows lengthen and grow darker as
  the, moon descended toward the high hills on his left hand. He felt lonely
  and weird. His anger, long ago evaporated, had left a sense of mental
  emptiness and futility. Gaglajung, on the right, became a soot-black, solemn
  fang upreared against the stars. After a while it resembled an enormous
  woman's face in profile&mdash;coarse nose pointed skyward&mdash;coarse,
  impudent lips.</p>

  <p>The stars grew brilliant on the darkening sky. Blackness crept into the
  shadows. The sparse trees grew one with the night. Then, in front of him,
  again he saw Wu Tu's eyes, but he marked a change. They seemed farther away
  than usual&mdash;less human&mdash;more real&mdash; larger&mdash;too large and
  too high from the ground to be hers or an animal's. They became pale green,
  moving against a background of impenetrable gloom. He had not before seen
  them move in that way, independently of the movement of his own eyes. They
  made him shudder.</p>

  <p>He felt for the bruise on the back of his head, suspecting that the blow
  received at Wu Tu's might have affected his vision: he had heard of that
  happening to a man. But the bruise had healed, and his eyes felt all right.
  Then he reached for a cigarette, but instead of lighting it he went into the
  tent and brought out a service revolver. He sat down again and examined the
  loading. Then he looked again for those eyes in the dark. They were
  there.</p>

  <p>They were enormous&mdash;no longer in the least like Wu Tu's. Their
  movement was irregular. It was stealthy. They were coming toward
  him&mdash;high up&mdash;twenty feet from the ground. He could see nothing
  beneath them&mdash;no head &mdash;merely eyes, of a luminous, disgusting,
  cruel green, like a light he had once seen in a cavern where a fakir wrought
  obscene miracles. They suggested a dank smell, but he knew that was
  imagination because he could smell the good earthy scent of the dew on the
  dust.</p>

  <p>He could hear nothing except ordinary night sounds, such as the wing-whirr
  of insects and the high, excited, almost inaudible squeak of bats. An owl
  hooted two or three times. The eyes came nearer. He began to feel deathly
  afraid and thought of summoning the servants, but dismissed that thought the
  moment it crossed his mind.</p>

  <p>The moon vanished beyond the hump of a hill and utter darkness swallowed
  the last shadows. Then the pale light of the monstrous eyes increased. He
  could see they were set in a man's head&mdash;or a head like a man's&mdash;a
  giant's, but too small for a man twenty feet high. It seemed to be suspended
  in air. Its movement was slow, elastic, partly from side to side with a
  swaying effect.</p>

  <p>The face was thin, mean, livid. It had a straggling beard. It resembled
  the face of a tortured and decapitated hillman he had seen near Quetta, its
  beard matted with blood; only this one was alive and moved haggard lips. It
  drew nearer. The eyes glared malign intelligence of unintelligible horrors;
  their loathsome irises looked dull blood-red; but it was difficult to tell
  their real color because the ghoulish green predominated. Presently the gloom
  beneath the head grew vaguely luminous, and then horror crept up Blair's
  spine until his short hair rose and he sat rigid, not breathing, with his
  heart thumping.</p>

  <p>He could see the thing's body. It resembled a slimy black bag, shaped like
  a stomach. The thing was an octopus. It walked on six snake-like tentacles of
  prodigious length. There were suckers on them that opened and closed with
  rhythmic movement, each one separately. The two foremost arms reached and
  writhed slimily green through the dark. He could feel one of them stirring
  the air within ten paces. He couldn't move. He couldn't take his eyes off the
  face. It seemed to see him and yet not to see him&mdash;to be conscious of
  him&mdash;to be feeling for him. Perhaps it was blinded by the light of the
  tent, but it stared like a ghoul in the depths of a dark sea.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he thought of Wu Tu&mdash;saw a mental picture of her coiled on
  her lounge in Bombay. He dismissed that with an almost panic-effort of will,
  he did not know why; but he felt urged to think of her and he rebelled
  against it. The face was coming nearer. One of the long arms almost touched
  him. The thing danced&mdash;as an octopus does&mdash;as big spiders
  do&mdash;with the pitiless, absolute rage of malice&mdash;slowly&mdash;on the
  tips of its outspread tentacles. He could see the thing's teeth.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he thought of Henrietta. He was instantly bathed in relief that
  she was not there. The relief relaxed him. He remembered the revolver then.
  He cocked it, rested it on his left elbow, aimed carefully and fired straight
  at the thing's face. It vanished. There was utter and instant darkness where
  it had been. The noise of the shot awoke his servants: he could hear them
  scurrying out of their tents. But Blair's attention was riveted on something
  else.</p>

  <p>Ten feet away, directly in front of him in the glow from the tent lamp, a
  man stood smiling. Blair, sweating, trying to control his muscles that wanted
  to tremble, covered the man with the revolver and held it fairly steady. It
  was several seconds before he could force himself to speak.</p>

  <p>"Come here," he commanded then. "<i>Idherao</i>."</p>

  <p>Then he recognized the man from the Salween country, Taron Ling, who took
  service with the police commissioner in Bombay on the strength of a forged
  testimonial.</p>

  <p>"You?" he said, getting command of his voice. "What are you doing
  here?"</p>

  <p>Taron Ling strode forward with quiet insolence, making no salaam or any
  gesture of respect. Two of Blair's servants, looking scared, with their
  turbans awry, approached the man from either side, and there were other
  servants peering around the tent, but he ignored them all.</p>

  <p>"Doing?" he answered. "Doing nothing. Am come seeking service."</p>

  <p>"What as?"</p>

  <p>"Guide. Without me, you not finding Henrietta."</p>

  <p>"Damn your impudence! Is that the way you speak of her? Where are your
  manners? Where's your chit from the commissioner?"</p>

  <p>"Not have any."</p>

  <p>"Ran, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No, not running. Seeing you shoot tiger&mdash;good shot&mdash;shooting
  me, no&mdash;bad shot. You like what you just now see?" The man's smile was
  that of a blackmailer; there was threat behind it.</p>

  <p>Blair's servants, observing the revolver, drew their own deductions and
  surrounded the man from behind. Nothing increases a man's panic like a weapon
  ready to be used. Blair uncocked the revolver and laid it on the table to
  calm his own nerves. He beckoned to the man to come closer and sat studying
  him in the lamp glow. He was dressed in a khaki tunic suit and a nondescript
  turban that offered no clue to his classification. His slightly Mongolian
  eyes were as bright as a snake's and alive with amused intelligence.</p>

  <p>"So you followed me, eh?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"How did you know where I went?"</p>

  <p>"Knowing also where Sahiba Henrietta went. Why not? Knowing Wu Tu. Knowing
  Zaman Ali. Knowing where to look for Frennisham Bahadur. Knowing too
  much."</p>

  <p>"Do you know Chetusingh?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded again. Somehow or other his nod suggested tragedy, but
  Blair was not quite trusting his imagination at the moment. He decided that
  he would follow that suspicion later.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by saying you will guide me to the Sahiba Henrietta? Do
  you mean to her tent?"</p>

  <p>"You knowing soon enough," he answered, insolent&mdash;confident.</p>

  <p>Blair decided to reduce that confidence. He needed time, too, to replenish
  his own. He gave orders to a Rajput retainer, whose mission in life was to
  clothe obedience with the cloak of courage and to adorn both with
  dignity:</p>

  <p>"Keep this man under close observation until I send for him again. Give
  him a tent to himself and don't let him speak to anyone."</p>

  <p>"Shall I tie him, sahib?"</p>

  <p>"Only if he makes trouble. Tell the cook I'll take <i>chota hazri</i>
  now."</p>

  <p>"<i>Hookum hai</i>." (It is an order.)</p>

  <p>Taron Ling offered no resistance.</p>

  <p>Tea came twenty minutes later. Blair drank it hot, grateful that it
  scalded his throat and made life real again, while he watched the false dawn
  glimmer on the broken fanged summit of Gaglajung.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">CHAPTER SIX</a></h2>

  <p class="quote">It is useless to try to descend into knowledge or to seek it
  except we ascend toward it. They who are reputed to know most and who demand
  to be honored accordingly, are gatherers of shadows. They who truly know,
  know this: the known is but the shadow of the Unknown. It is therefore
  nothing.</p>

  <p class="quote">&mdash;From the Eighth of the Nine Books of Noor
  Ali.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE Rangar came at dawn, his old eyes looking as if they
  lacked sleep. Beneath his formal courtesy there lurked a hint of foreboding.
  He nervously avoided Blair's gaze. He turned his back on Gaglajung. He sat on
  a camp-stool in the delicious cool light of early morning and watched Blair
  but pretended not to, croakily criticizing the camp servants.</p>

  <p>"By God, when I went soldiering we cleaned camp at cock-crow. By daybreak,
  if there was dung left in the horse-lines, someone heard about it."</p>

  <p>Other than the customary politeness about Blair's health, he asked no
  questions. His eyes did not rest for more than a moment on the tent where
  Taron Ling lay, but he sat where he could detect a movement of the tent-flap
  without turning his head. The Indian night that has a hundred thousand eyes
  had evidently kept him well informed. He awaited events. Thirty minutes after
  daybreak his young grandson arrived, on a lean pony from the direction of the
  ford, dismounted and squatted at the old man's feet. A servant led the pony
  away. The boy said nothing, but the old Rangar seemed to understand his
  silence, although he, too, made no remark.</p>

  <p>Grayne came a few minutes after that, cantering. His horse's legs and
  belly were wet from splashing through the ford, but he reined in as if in no
  hurry at all, when he drew near the camp. He looked peculiarly unofficial in
  polo helmet, shirt and riding-breeches. He wore smoked spectacles, but
  removed them before shaking hands, which he did rather diffidently, as if not
  quite sure it was expected of him. He merely nodded to the Rangar, who stood
  up and bowed.</p>

  <p>Blair received him with the smile of old acquaintance: "Having a good
  time? Enjoying your leave?"</p>

  <p>"So, so. Making the best of it. Couldn't afford England. Bought too many
  expensive books the last year or two."</p>

  <p>That looked probable. He had the eyes of a bookish man&mdash;searchers of
  others' opinions&mdash;friendly, sympathetic, intelligent, not dynamic
  &mdash;perhaps lazy in some ways.</p>

  <p>"Shooting?" Blair asked as they sat down together.</p>

  <p>"Not much. Reading and writing mostly. Hear you shot a tiger last
  night."</p>

  <p>"Yes. How's Henrietta Frensham?"</p>

  <p>"Apropos of tigers? I don't know how or where she is. I came to speak
  about her."</p>

  <p>"Isn't she in your camp?"</p>

  <p>"No. She should be, but she didn't sleep there. My servant told me your
  men brought her home, long after midnight. As a matter of fact, I heard her.
  It was so damned hot I was lying without a stitch on, so I couldn't come out
  to speak to her. My wife was' asleep in her own tent. I imagine I. fell
  asleep pretty soon afterwards.</p>

  <p>"I like to watch the sunrise, so the boy has orders to call me in plenty
  of time for it, and I take tea in pyjamas outside the tent. My wife usually
  joins me, and Henrietta sometimes does. This morning I wanted to talk to her,
  so I sent to see if she was awake. She wasn't there. Nobody has seen her
  leave camp. So I rode over to ask what you know."</p>

  <p>"Funny time to want to talk to her," Blair suggested.</p>

  <p>"Better time than any other. She sometimes actually talks at daybreak,
  instead of listening and saying nothing. Doris and I have respected her
  silence, of course. It's comprehensible. She probably feels much worse about
  her father's disappearance than she cares to reveal to anyone&mdash;even her
  friends. I've let her do pretty much as she pleases."</p>

  <p>"So I hear," Blair answered. "What did you have in mind to say to her at
  daybreak?" Grayne looked vaguely uncomfortable. He did his best to look
  judicious&mdash;leaned back. lighted a cigar, pursing his lips on the
  butt.</p>

  <p>"There's a limit," he said. "She's a damned nice girl, although unusual.
  To put it mildly, she's unconventional. But I'd trust her anywhere, in nearly
  any circumstances." He blew smoke through his nose. "I don't believe there's
  a soul on this countryside who'd harm her. But she overdoes it. I mean, for
  instance, where the hell is she now? Home in the early hours&mdash;off again
  before daybreak without a word to anyone&mdash;tigers, you know?
  snakes&mdash;besides, who'd bet there aren't dacoits in the hills? There
  probably aren't, but there might be. Doris and I don't mind her missing meals
  or anything like that, but&mdash;well, I ask you."</p>

  <p>Blair waited. He was not there to be asked, but to find out. Grayne
  continued:</p>

  <p>"Between you and me, I object to her going where I myself couldn't go
  without a special warrant and probably couldn't get that. To give you an idea
  of what I mean&mdash;when I put in for long leave and told 'em I meant to
  spend it here, I was cautioned&mdash;just as it I'd been a probationer fresh
  from home&mdash;on no account to poke my nose into places regarded as
  sacred.</p>

  <p>"They knew I'm interested in that kind of thing and they ticked me off
  like a recruit. I haven't even been up on Gaglajung. You know the legend? I'd
  intended to look for the secret passage that the three kings forced Ranjeet
  Singh to betray. Of course I couldn't in the circumstances. However, I've
  reason to believe that Henrietta goes into all sorts of places, Gaglajung
  included. Crypts. Caverns. God knows,where she goes."</p>

  <p>"You say you've reason to believe it?"</p>

  <p>"Good reason. One of my specials saw her, week before last, being led by a
  local priest into a place at the back of a shrine near here that only
  Brahmins are supposed to enter. What does that mean?"</p>

  <p>"What do you think it means?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'd say she's quite likely looking for her father. You know,
  there's a vague report of his having been seen hereabouts. I don't believe
  it. But perhaps she does. She seems to be on good terms with the local
  priests and peasantry. That's all very well, of course; but you know, I'd be
  in the devil of a mess if anything should happen to her. I'd be put on the
  mat, and no two ways about it. As her host, it would be a bit awkward for me
  to have to&mdash;dammit, you know what I mean&mdash;she's&mdash; Have you any
  influence with her?"</p>

  <p>Blair avoided the question:</p>

  <p>"Did you examine her tent?" he answered.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"It didn't occur to me. Why should I?"</p>

  <p>"So you don't know if anything's missing?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Would your wife know if there were anything missing?"</p>

  <p>"She might. She might know what to look for. I wouldn't."</p>

  <p>The Rangar was watching. Blair, to appear casual, struck a match on the
  heel of his boot and lighted a cigarette. He was almost sick with a sense of
  dread, so he contrived to look rather cheerful.</p>

  <p>"Don't look at me," he said. "Look at that kite over there on the dead
  tree, as if we were talking about that. Go back and get your wife to search
  Henrietta's tent. Take care that' your servants don't see what you're doing.
  Write me a full report at once; I'll endorse and forward it to the proper
  quarter."</p>

  <p>"Good God, man, do. you think?"</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking."</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know what you mean. She had a servant, I suppose. Where is
  he?"</p>

  <p>"In camp. It was he who first suggested that she might have returned here
  to talk to you, since she was here last night. Do you mean you
  think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did he see her leave camp?"</p>

  <p>"No. He was asleep under the fly of her tent when your men brought her
  home. I suppose they told him where she'd been. She told him he was not
  needed, so he went off to sleep in the servants' quarters. Their tents are
  about fifty yards from ours. He had no notion she was gone again until I sent
  for him."</p>

  <p>"Has Henrietta said anything to you about her father?"</p>

  <p>"We've discussed him, of course. The impression I got was that it hurt her
  to talk about him. Doris put a damper on that topic of conversation; she
  called me a tactless brute. Henrietta isn't what I'd call garrulous at any
  time; the only pointer I remember her giving was when she said, a few days
  ago, that her father might, have been a lieutenant-general by now if he
  wasn't such a student of Indian magic. But when I questioned her about that
  she shut up."</p>

  <p>"What was your line of interrogation?"</p>

  <p>"Stupid," I daresay. I asked if she thought it possible that Frensham
  might have fallen foul of some of those sorcerers who like to keep their
  tricks a deadly secret. They might have killed him for discovering a trick.
  She said Frensham had never been interested in faked miracles. Then she shut
  right up. You know her better than I do, You know how she shuts up."</p>

  <p>"Why do you call that a pointer?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it isn't. But it's full moon tomorrow night. It makes some women
  restless, you know. It makes her restless. I don't know whether she's
  superstitious about it or not. But she has it marked.on the calendar, and she
  told us not to worry if she should go out to study the full moon, and should
  be gone quite some time. If it's your business, I wish like the devil you'd
  put a kibosh on her wandering around the country. It 'ud be damned unpleasant
  for me to have to do it.. Can you?"</p>

  <p>"If it isn't too late." Blair answered. "Have you had breakfast?"</p>

  <p>"All i ever take, thanks."</p>

  <p>"Go and search her tent, then. Search it thoroughly, and send me a written
  report. Keep It secret. Say nothing whatever to her if she turns up. Can you
  trust your wife to hold her tongue?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"All right. See you later."</p>

  <p>Grayne rode away, looking gloomy. Blair studied the Rangar; he had the
  painter's trick of looking sideways at what he was observing carefully. A
  servant brought the camp-stool close and the Rangar sat down.</p>

  <p>"That was a good tale you were telling last night," Blair began. "Ranjeet
  of the Ford seems to have been a strange character."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but his ghost is quiet now, sahib."</p>

  <p>"You say he was a law to himself. In what way do you mean that?"</p>

  <p>"Hah! He used to override the Brahmins.. He respected them not at all. It
  is a pity there are none nowadays who have that courage. It was Ranjeet of
  the Ford who gave the Bats the Brahmin privileges that they claim to this
  day. He is said to have learned a Brahmin secret&mdash;some say by torture.
  It is known that he slew a Brahmin and put a Bat in his place. And it is said
  that because of that a Brahmin betrayed him to the,three kings, intending
  Ranjeet should be slain by them,, so that his stolen secret might die with
  him. But the Bats&mdash;or so men say&mdash;already knew it. The Bats are
  worse than pukka Brahmins. They have no sense of responsibility. But they
  know the Brahmin law. The people groan, but submit to extortion."</p>

  <p>"My father&mdash;" said Blair. He threw away his cigarette and looked
  straight in front of him. He had reached a decision. He spoke quietly, in a
  level voice. "I need your confidence.". The old man looked startled. He
  stared.</p>

  <p>"By Allah," he answered after a moment, "there is none to whom I give that
  more willingly."</p>

  <p>"Because I believe that, I asked it. Where is Miss Frensham?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, I know not. Before God, and by my beard, I know not."</p>

  <p>"But you knew she is missing?"</p>

  <p>"One said something pi the sort. So I came hither to learn more of the
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Who spoke of her?"</p>

  <p>"One in the dark, whose name I know not, nor w h o he is, nor any thing,at
  all about him. It happened I lay cursing the heat that frets these old bones.
  I bethought me of that tiger-skin, that is pegged in my yard awaiting alum.
  It might be sore temptation to someone desiring claws against the evil eye. I
  went out in the dark to be sure the watchman was awake. And as I spoke with
  the watchman a voice cried, 'Ranjeet's wife walks, seeking for her lover.
  Spirits of the dead are leading her from Gaglajung.'</p>

  <p>"Whoever had spoken stole away into the dark. But the watchman also had
  heard him, so he and I considered the matter. We knew, because such news
  travels fast, that the Frennisham sahiba had been taken to Grayne's camp by
  your honor's servants. And so I bethought me, should she then come thence
  toward Doongar she must use the footpath that leads over the shoulder of
  Gaglajung. Is it not my business to know what happens? I sent a messenger.
  He, going and returning swiftly, told me the sahiba is missing from her tent,
  wherein she had not slept. So I came hither."</p>

  <p>"Do you know a man from the Salween country by the name of Taron Ling?"
  Blair asked.</p>

  <p>"No." The Rangar looked uneasy. Morning mauve had vanished. The sharp,
  hot, golden sunlight limned him mercilessly; it revealed fear. The young
  grandson took the old man's hand and watched him&mdash;feeling, not
  comprehending. Blair lighted his pipe. "Let the child sit yonder under that
  tree," he said after a moment. Then he called to his servant, "Bring forth
  Taron Ling!"</p>

  <p>The Rangar shuddered. He had let down the bars of confidence in response
  to Blair's request. But he had not revealed all he knew&mdash; not by the
  width of the gulf between East and West, between youth and old age.</p>

  <p>Taron Ling came leering at the men who guarded him. Blair dismissed
  them.</p>

  <p>"Have you received food? Were you made comfortable?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You address me as sahib."</p>

  <p>"Smite him in the teeth!" said the Rangar. "By Allah&mdash;" His voice
  grumbled away into silence when Taron Ling looked straight at him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib," said Taron Ling.</p>

  <p>"Tell the <i>Zemindar</i> Abdurrahman Khan that which you told me before
  daybreak." The semi-Mongolian eyes conned the old man's face curiously. "I
  came seeking service,' he said slowly, "as a guide."</p>

  <p>"To find what?" Blair demanded.</p>

  <p>"Frennisham sahiba."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Frennisham bahadur."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Nothing else."</p>

  <p>"Beware of him!" warned the Rangar <i>sotto voce</i>. "This one is an
  <i>ibilis</i>&mdash;a <i>dugpa</i> they call such, where he learned magic. He
  is from hell. He should be sent back."</p>

  <p>"You spoke," said Blair, "of Wu Tu and of Zaman Ali."</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where they are?"</p>

  <p>He nodded again. Although he stood more or less at respectful attention he
  exuded the scorn of Olympian knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where Chetusingh is?"</p>

  <p>"You finding all that out," he answered. The Rangar spoke up, almost
  slobbering with nervous anger: "There is but one course &mdash;flog him!
  Allah! I have seen such as him flayed and pegged amid the flies before the
  devil left them! He and a Bat-Brahmin hereabouts are two of one liver. Flog
  him, sahib!"</p>

  <p>Blair stared at the Rangar. Such hysteria as that suggested either genuine
  information or else total ignorance. In either event interrogation was the
  wrong course; the old man needed strength to lean on.</p>

  <p>"True," he said, "he knows a trick or two. He does them rather well. He
  fooled me badly, shortly before daylight. He may even be able to do the rope
  trick that; we've heard about so often&mdash;you know&mdash;throw a rope in
  the air, climb it, vanish and pull the rope up after him. He's probably a
  particularly skilful hypnotist. At any rate, he knows how to trick
  imagination&mdash;once. What do you know about him?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the Rangar. "God forbid that I should know about him."</p>

  <p>Plainly he did know something, but would not tell. He had known about
  Brigadier-General Frensham's disappearance. How? Why? Perhaps Henrietta
  Frensham had told him. But he had also known, before Blair knew it, that
  Henrietta, too, had vanished; and his tale of a voice in the dark was
  unconvincing.</p>

  <p>"Send for the Bat-Brahmin," Blair commanded.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, he would not obey me."</p>

  <p>"Very well, I will go myself and find him."</p>

  <p>"Sahib?"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"That is unwise."</p>

  <p>"Wisdom isn't always commendable,", said Blair. "Patience isn't always a
  virtue, either. Care to come with me?"</p>

  <p>"Come alone!" advised Taron Ling in a voice like a bell. He had a quick
  understanding of English. He used it well enough when not deliberately
  misusing it.</p>

  <p>"He will deceive you," the Rangar warned. "He is a devil, that one."</p>

  <p>Blair stood up, eye to eye against Taron Ling. He had an impulse to punch
  him, but that was easy enough to restrain. A subtler impulse' almost made him
  hesitate to trespass where the Rangar feared to intrude. He saw Wu Tu's eyes
  again, behind Taron Ling's, fading and reappearing, fading again, as if two
  influences struggled for control.</p>

  <p>"Can you work your tricks by daylight?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>The Rangar objected. "No, no! In the name of God, no!"</p>

  <p>Taron Ling, looked haughty. "Tricks?" he answered "You will say I trick
  you if I show you Frennisham sahiba?"</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"Now."</p>

  <p>"Show me."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Blair saw Henrietta, although the vision was more distinct than
  natural eyesight. She looked unhappy and yet curiously excited. The strange
  thing was. that he could see everything else, including Taron Ling, quite
  normally; but whichever way he turned his head he could still see Henrietta.
  Her surroundings were shadowy, and in the shadow, to one side of her, was the
  Chinese girl who attended the upstairs door at Wu Tu's house in Bombay.</p>

  <p>There were other people in the shadows, but he could not distinguish them.
  The vision had the quality of a vivid dream. The color of Henrietta's frock
  changed as he watched&mdash; changed repeatedly. First she was wearing the
  loose sort of tennis-frock of the night before, then the rose-colored evening
  dress of that night in Bombay when he had dragged her to see the fakir, then
  the tennis frock again. The vision vanished. Taron Ling spoke:</p>

  <p>"Trick?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Anger stirred Blair strangely. There is no worse insolence on earth than
  interference with another's mental processes. He had asked for it, but he did
  not like it any better for that. Even though his reason told him this was
  only an extension of the art by which a story-teller conjures visions in an
  audience's mind, he hated the imposition&mdash;loathed it. He was about to
  speak savagely and act drastically.</p>

  <p>It crossed his mind to arrest Taron Ling&mdash;there was plenty of law to
  permit it&mdash; and to send him under close arrest to Bombay for the
  commissioner to deal with. But a messenger came.</p>

  <p>He saw the man running from the direction of Doongar village with a
  telegram in a cleft stick, so he waited and went into the tent for his pipe,
  cursing himself because his hand trembled while he filled it. He felt sick,
  and horribly scared on Henrietta's account. Through the tent opening he saw
  the Rangar walk away and sit down under the tree beside his grandson, leaving
  Taron Ling standing alone. He wondered, supposing he should arrest the man;
  who could be found to convey him to railhead. Perhaps Grayne would do it.</p>

  <p>He wished he had kept Grayne with him a little longer instead of packing
  him off to search Henrietta's tent.</p>

  <p>The sweating messenger panted to the tent. Blair signed for the telegram,
  told the man to wait and returned into the tent to read the message. It was
  in code from the commissioner, and it took him nearly ten minutes to work it
  out because the signaller had made., a mistake in one word, which obliged him
  to guess. It was a long message, but he worked it out finally:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>Wu Tu left Bombay two days ago with ticket for Lahore
  accompanied by twenty women and five men after closing her residence. Should
  she leave train en route she will be followed. Taron Ling on your track.
  Strongly advise you keep him under observation long as possible before arrest
  as he is probably a key man. He is well shadowed. Eleven</tt> [that meant
  Rowland of the C.I.D.] <tt>has sent three specials to watch and help if
  necessary. No news of Frensham or Chetusingh. Your stolen pass reported found
  in Calcutta probably intended to mislead investigation. Remember get facts
  not fireworks. Your reply will be forwarded. o. 9.</tt></p><br>

  <p>So the commissioner also had left Bombay. That indicated probably swift
  developments. Blair wrote out an answer in code. That took ten
  minutes:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>Henrietta vanished before daylight this morning after
  inconclusive interview with me. Taron Ling here apparently in league with
  Bat-Brahmin and producing mysterious phenomena of File FF type. No sign yet
  of Wu Tu or of specials. Taron Ling claims knowledge and offers to reveal
  whereabouts of Frensham and Henrietta. Shall accept offer. Recommend swift
  follow-up unless you hear from me within next twelve hours. Copy of this to
  Eleven. 088.</tt></p><br>

  <p>It was reassuring news that Howland had sent three men to lend a hand, in
  addition to the two who had been detailed by the commissioner to shadow Taron
  Ling. That there was no sign of them was nothing to worry about; such men
  were entirely capable of keeping their identity a secret until the last
  minute. Even the telegraph runner might be one of them.</p>

  <p>As he gave him the two messages and watched him tie them in the cleft
  stick, he observed him carefully, but there was no signal: he salaamed and
  trotted away toward Doongar with a corner of a cloth between his teeth. Blair
  stood staring after him, wondering whether lie had said enough in the
  telegram, and then looked for Taron Ling. The man had vanished.</p>

  <p>He called to the Rangar, "Where did Taron Ling go?"</p>

  <p>The Rangar got up and walked toward him, looking older than he did at
  daybreak. The rims of his eyes were red and watery. He was trembling.</p>

  <p>"Is it not enough that he has gone?" he answered. "Nay. I saw not which
  way he went."</p>

  <p>He could not have gone far. Blair walked around the tent and questioned
  the servants. None had seen him, or at any rate none admitted it; if they had
  seen, they refused to say. He sent them scattering in all directions to look
  for the man, noticing that they went unwillingly. Then he returned to the
  Rangar, who had sat down on the stool under the tent awning and was staring
  into vacancy.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "you promised confidence."</p>

  <p>"You have it, sahib. I have said, beware of that one! Unless he be flogged
  or slain no good can come of dealing with him. If he returns, I say, thrash
  him with a horsewhip. That is what I say, and I say it again. Now, if the
  presence permits, I will take my grandson to the village."</p>

  <p>Blair let him go. There was nothing to be gained by asking questions that
  would not be answered. Presently, one by one the servants drifted back and
  reported no sign of Taron Ling. They were not mutinous, but they had lost
  elan and had probably not searched far. An atmosphere of dread had invaded
  the camp. The monotonous bong-bong-bong of a coppersmith-bird sounded
  ominous. The cry of a peacock was like a scream of anguish. As the brassy sun
  grew higher in the heavens, and the hot wind rose, charm deserted the now
  dried-out countryside and its scorched, dust-covered skeleton glared naked
  amid tired trees. There was a greenish haze of dust and heat that veiled the
  view. And through that veil rode Grayne again, like an apparition. He
  dismounted, blinking behind smoked spectacles, and spoke in a hard, forced
  voice without preliminary:</p>

  <p>"Damned strange business in my opinion. Doris searched her tent, and so
  did I. Two suitcases gone&mdash;soap, towels, toothbrush&mdash;all that kind
  of thing. What's the earthly use of writing that in a report? She can't have
  carried 'em&mdash;must have had porters. No note&mdash;no message&mdash;but
  her money is all in the steel trunk, and the trunk was unlocked. What do you
  make of that?"</p>

  <p>"Why not write it?" Blair asked. He suddenly felt better. Suitcases? That
  looked like premeditation. He offered Grayne a cigarette. Grayne glanced
  keenly at him before answering.</p>

  <p>"Well, to tell you the plain truth, old man, you looked rattled first
  thing this morning. You still do. It occurred to me&mdash;she'd been here,
  hadn't she?&mdash;she might have cleared out on your account. She's a queer
  girl. Did you have a row with her?"</p>

  <p>Blair lighted his cigarette, turning his back to the hot wind, to avoid
  answering. Grayne continued:</p>

  <p>"None of my business&mdash;but&mdash;are you down here to see her? I mean,
  it might be damned unpleasant for you to have reports go in and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Blair interrupted: "Doris expects you back?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"She all right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Doris won't worry&mdash;or if she does she'll send a servant to find
  out."</p>

  <p>"Write her a note," said Blair. "I'll send a servant with it. Say you're
  staying for a few hours to oblige me. Write your report in my tent and put
  down every detail you can remember&mdash; conversations&mdash;minor
  incidents&mdash;omit nothing, no matter how unimportant, since Henrietta came
  to stay with you and Doris. If I'm not back by noon, or if I don't send a
  message, you'd better take charge and either move my camp over the ford to
  yours or bring yours over here, no matter which. And if anyone asks for me,
  say I've gone looking for the Bat-Brahmin of Gaglajung."</p>

  <p>"That swine?"</p>

  <p>"What do you know about him?" Blair asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's a swine, that's all. He'll tell you nothing. He's a saucy
  impostor, but he isn't dangerous"! He makes too fat a living off the peasants
  to risk it by taking a chance with the police."</p>

  <p>"Where will I find him?"</p>

  <p>"Lord knows. Anyone will tell you if you ride up to Doongar village. But
  you may find him at Ganesha's shrine near where you shot the tiger last
  night. I'll bet you one rupee to an anna a word that you get no information
  from him."</p>

  <p>Blair ordered his horse saddled and brought to the tent with a mounted
  <i>sais</i> to follow him. While he waited he searched his mind for something
  else to say to Grayne. But it seemed wiser to say nothing. He could hardly
  tell him about Taron Ling's phenomenal tricks, and what else was there to
  say? Suddenly he saw Taron Ling in the distance, on a rock by the track
  toward Doongar, apparently sitting waiting for him.</p>

  <p>"Help yourself to' anything you need," he said to Grayne. Then he mounted
  and rode away, into the scorching wind.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">CHAPTER SEVEN</a></h2>

  <p class="quote">Truth clothes herself in mystery. Wherever ye see a mystery,
  seek Truth; and ye shall find it as ye found Hope, which none might have
  known were it not for despair.</p>

  <p class="quote">&mdash;From the Ninth (unfinished) Book of Noor Ali</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE Rajput attendant who rode behind Blair sat splendidly,
  but his gray horse betrayed the condition of the man's mind, a weird
  nervousness passing from rider to beast. The gray horse was as frantic as if
  tigers were about. He frightened the bay that Blair rode. But that did Blair
  good: he had to get complete self-mastery in order to control the animal.</p>

  <p>A hundred yards before they reached the rock on which Taron Ling sat
  waiting the Rajput's gray went mad&mdash;plunged&mdash;reared&mdash; cannoned
  into Blair's horse&mdash;almost unseated him&mdash;broke a rein and bolted as
  if all the devils of hell were following. Taron Ling laughed. He was frugal
  of laughter: one scornful "Hah!" was all he needed to express his kind of
  amusement. Then he jumped from the rock and started walking rapidly, not
  toward Doongar village but along a winding track that led toward the dry
  river-bed, through sparse, hot jungle.</p>

  <p>Blair followed, riding slowly in a cloud of flies that were as persistent
  and disturbing as his thoughts. He had no other weapon than a light
  riding-whip, and he had an acute premonition of danger. It occurred to him
  several times to return to the camp for his revolver, but he dismissed that
  thought after considering it. Taron Ling appeared also unarmed, and might not
  wait for him. He was not afraid of the man's hypnotic tricks, extraordinary
  though they were. He felt fairly sure that, now he was on guard, such tricks
  would not succeed again. He had definite orders to walk straight into any
  trap he might see, and he felt equally sure he was being led into
  one&mdash;equally sure the Rajput on the gray had thought so too, and had
  welcomed his horse's panic as the lesser of two evils, even if he had not
  deliberately encouraged the horse to bolt.</p>

  <p>There was probably not much danger. He was under observation; he had a
  telegram in his pocket that said so; if anything should happen to him,
  somebody would soon know about it&mdash;follow up&mdash;rescue. He had a very
  small sense of his own personal importance in the scheme of things. He was a
  pawn in the game. The game was playing. He kept Taron Ling in sight until
  they came to the dry pool in the river-bed where he had shot the tiger the
  previous night.</p>

  <p>It looked different by day. Night's loveliness was a dream that had
  vanished. The sun was well up. Shortening shadows lay on quartz sand,
  bleached and drab, except where it sparkled in sunlight: there the glare was
  painful. There was some relief from the choking hot wind, because of the
  curve of the tree-lined gorge that formed the river-bed beyond. Where
  Henrietta had descended in the moonlight from the flank of Gaglajung was a
  raw, dry scar of glaring boulders; and the stone where he and she had sat was
  a sun scorched lump of ruin, tumbled from a dead hill. It resembled a
  tooth.</p>

  <p>The remains of the tiger were black with flies. A dozen vultures took wing
  clumsily&mdash; gorged, filthy scavengers that had stripped the dead brute's
  bones as clean of flesh as the daylight had stripped the scene of romance.
  Gaglajung, up aloft on the right, resembled dry bones breaking through the
  back of a decaying hill.</p>

  <p>Taron Ling, pausing in full sunlight and facing the gorge, shouted one
  bell-like monosyllable, as startling as a rifle-shot. It was. answered by
  another, like the bark of a wild dog.</p>

  <p>Out from the throat of the gorge a man came walking handsomely with a
  mountaineer's swing of the loins. He wore a loosely bound gray loin-cloth
  that revealed his right leg as high as the hip, bronzed and muscular. He
  looked like a dancer of heroic ballet parts, and carried a short stick like a
  marshal's baton in his right hand, using that to salute Taron Ling; but to
  Blair he made no gesture of respect, although he walked up close to the horse
  and peered at the rider's face. His eyes were as satyr-like as a
  he-goat's.</p>

  <p>"My <i>chela</i>," said Taron Ling. "He will take take the horse now. He
  does what I tell him."</p>

  <p>THE <i>chela</i> seized the horse's rein. Common riot-drill provided a
  very simple answer to that impudence. But to have kicked the man under the
  chin would not have revealed the whereabouts of Henrietta. Besides, it was of
  utmost importance to learn what Taron Ling, if followed, might be able to
  reveal. Blair was almost sure he saw a man's face peering between two rocks
  in deep shadow on the flank of the gorge; there was more than one chance in a
  hundred that that might be one of the commissioner's men. If not, it was at
  any rate a witness, who would report what lie had seen to someone and set
  rumor moving; rumor would provide a clue that might be followed; so that,
  whatever might happen, he would not disappear as Frensham, Henrietta and
  Chetusingh had done, leaving no clue at all. It seemed wise to ignore the
  <i>chela</i>'s action for the moment; and it might not be a bad idea to let
  Taron Ling think he had established hypnotic control.</p>

  <p>"You must come on foot now. He shall take the horse back with a message,"
  said Taron Ling.</p>

  <p>"Message from whom?"</p>

  <p>"From you."</p>

  <p>"To say where we're going&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He will know what to say."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"He already knows it." He had forgotten to mispronounce
  English&mdash;spoke it excellently.</p>

  <p>Two heads showed in the shadow's, quite distinctly, for a moment. With the
  corner of his eye Blair saw a hand steal like a snake's head into the
  sunlight, spread all five fingers three times and withdraw. He knew that
  signal&mdash; answered it, pushing his helmet to the back of his head and
  wiping his forehead three times with a handkerchief.</p>

  <p>It was safe to go forward: the Department was on the watch and would learn
  whatever happened. An involuntary shudder crept up his spine and along his
  shoulders, but he contrived to appear casual. He flicked flies off his face
  with his handkerchief, then treed his right foot from the stirrup.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I'm curious. I'll go with you."</p>

  <p>He dismounted. The <i>chela</i> led the horse away in the direction of the
  camp without waiting for further orders. Blair felt glad he had left Grayne
  in charge. Whatever verbal message the <i>chela</i> might deliver, even
  Grayne was hardly likely to accept it without suspicion if there was nothing
  in writing. Grayne might not be the kind of man who seizes responsibility and
  acts swiftly on suspicion, but he would either detain the <i>chela</i> or
  else send a servant or two to check up.</p>

  <p>"I am ready. Which way?"</p>

  <p>Taron Ling immediately turned his back and led up-gorge to the footpath
  that Blair had taken the night before with Henrietta toward the shrine where
  the mad hermit had blessed the tiger-skin. Taron Ling, too, had the stride of
  a mountaineer; he climbed fast. Blair took his own time about following, and
  let him wait at frequent intervals. He had a half-hope of getting word with
  one of the men whom he could distinctly hear following through the jungle on
  either flank, of the gorge. They were making too much noise, and there was no
  need, as he saw it, for more than one at the moment; he would have liked to
  send one of them back to the camp with a message to Grayne. He even sat down
  for a rest, several times, hoping one of the men would creep up close, but
  they kept their distance, waiting when he waited.</p>

  <p>Taron Ling showed no impatience and no inclination to talk, until at last
  Blair stepped out on the level ledge where the shrine nestled against an
  almost sheer cliff. There was no sign of the mad hermit, but the Bat-Brahmin
  in freshly laundered white turban and loincloth came forward to meet them. He
  seemed to have been waiting within the shrine, he appeared so suddenly. He
  greeted Taron Ling like an old acquaintance and eyed Blair curiously, as if
  appraising his clothes for their value. In his eyes was the insolent audacity
  of the professional blessing- and cursing-monger, hard with avarice and,with
  experience of human gullibility.</p>

  <p>He offered Blair no greeting but turned his back and led toward the
  shrine, Taron Ling tailing behind, so that Blair walked between the two men
  until they reached the shrine and the Bat-Brahmin faced about in the dim
  entrance.</p>

  <p>There was an argument then. The Bat wanted Blair to take his boots off. He
  lifted one bare foot repeatedly, smiting the sole with the flat of his hand;
  but Taron Ling ridiculed him and tor a minute or two they looked like coming
  to blows, paying each other such scurrilous compliments that at last Blair
  intervened to restore peace. The dispute had served his present purpose; he
  had waited in the dim shrine entrance long enough tor the commissioner's men
  to watch which way he took and who was with him. The Bat-Brahmin, as a
  notorious character, could hardly be improved on as a link in a chain of
  evidence. He had no objection to removing his boots. He had often done that
  in religious buildings. But it occurred to him to see what Taron Ling would
  do if he refused; so he ordered the Bat-Brahmin out of the way and told Taron
  Ling to lead on in. Taron Ling shoved the Bat aside roughly. The Bat screamed
  like a beast; his outraged eyes almost popped from his head, but he thought
  better of striking back although he raised his right hand. He entered last,
  muttering obscenities with lips that slobbered malice. He had mad eyes. He
  seemed to be on the verge of an epileptic fit. Taron Ling kept calling him
  names that might have made even a sane man mad with anger.</p>

  <p>The shrine was not nearly large enough to be called a temple but it had
  beautiful fluted columns and its, walls were covered with carvings of the
  Hindu pantheon, the greater part of them monstrously obscene to western eyes.
  There was an atmosphere of peace, a reek of faded flowers, a heavy silence
  and, in the gloom at the rear amid the dimness of smoky oil-lamps, the genial
  image of the god Ganesha, elephant-trunked, pot-bellied, competent of
  judgment. The old mad hermit sat beside the image, too mad. too meditative to
  notice anyone except the Bat, at whom his eyes smiled like a child's who sees
  his mother.</p>

  <p>The back wall of the shrine was the mountain rock that had been quarried
  perpendicular and carved like the rest of the walls. It was impossible to see
  into the soot-black shadow behind the image, but it seemed strange.that the
  image should be set forth from the wall. It stood three feet forward from it.
  Taron Ling's irreverence seemed more than casual: he even spat on the floor
  at the foot of Ganesha. But it was rather a serious matter for a police
  officer in uniform to invade such a place without definite orders to do it,
  and Blair hesitated, peering into the gloom, until he saw that behind the
  image the rock wall had been left uncarved.</p>

  <p>There was a smooth place, of lighter color, of the same size as the image.
  At the base of the wall there remained a projecting ledge of the same height
  and width as the built up base in front of it on which the image actually
  rested and looked like an afterthought. In the rock wall, curiously placed
  amid the carvings, there were two big forged iron rings of ancient make and
  no obvious purpose. Blair, as he followed Taron Ling into the gloom, stumbled
  and nearly fell over a coil of thick rope.</p>

  <p>Then there was another altercation with the Bat, who changed his mind
  about permitting sacrilege. He screamed at Taron Ling. He tried to get in his
  way. Taron Ling took him roughly by the singlet and tore it as he hurled him
  backward easily with one hand. According to Hindu religious law there is no
  worse crime than to strike a Brahmin, and Bats claim Brahmin privileges. But
  the old hermit took no notice, and there were no other witnesses. The bat
  stood aside, glaring and muttering, with the light from the entrance making
  him look half human and half shadow. Taron Ling sprang to the ledge behind
  Ganesha, placing a hand on the image to steady himself. He offered his other
  hand to help Blair. Blair thought he detected movement, but he was not sure.
  He accepted Taron Ling's hand, and as he hauled himself up to the ledge, he
  too placed his hand on the back of the image. It did move. It rocked, almost
  imperceptibly. It rested, evidently, on a roller, or rollers, of stone or
  iron. Those rings in the wall were for the rope. Ganesha's image could be
  hauled back flat against the wall and probably one man. or at any rate two,
  could do it.</p>

  <p>Then the reason why revealed itself. Taron Ling stood astride of a dark
  hole, oval shaped and smooth edged&mdash;an undiscoverable hole to whoever
  regards a sacred image as a thing not to be moved or too closely examined.
  Taron Ling thrust a leg in the hole to show that there were steps beneath it.
  He tugged Blair's arm and signed to him to go down.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead." Blair ordered.</p>

  <p>He obeyed. For a moment Blair hesitated. Why not return to the entrance
  and try to signal to the men. whose job it was to keep him under observation,
  to come out of the jungle and follow? He could have done that in less than a
  minute. Not to do it was to add to the risk he was running. However, he
  decided those men probably knew their business or they would not have been
  picked for the job. and Taron Ling, with an arm up through the hole, seized
  his right foot to guide it downward to the top step. As long as Taron Ling
  was in front, not behind him, the odds were enough in his favor to make the
  risk worth taking. So he went into the hole, not sgueezing through too
  easily, and he discovered by their feel that the steps were of rough-hewn
  rock, irregularly spaced, descending at a steep angle. He was thirsty. He
  wished he had had a drink before he started out.</p>

  <p>He could see backward up through the hole, but not downward. When he
  hesitated, Taron Ling from beneath took his foot and tried to guide it, but
  Blair kicked the hand away. Neither man spoke. The heat was suffocating. The
  dust of dry bat-dung rose with an acrid stench. Blair sat and groped downward
  one step at a time, beating his hands against the stone from time to time to
  get the bat-filth oft his fingers.</p>

  <p>Trying to judge how far he had gone, he glanced upward and saw the
  Bat-Brahmin's face&mdash;or he supposed it was his&mdash;a silhouette framed
  in the egg-shaped hole. After that it grew suddenly darker&mdash;then totally
  dark, and when he looked upward he could see nothing at all. The Bat had
  closed the opening. Taron Ling laughed, but the sound had no overtone: it was
  mirthless.</p>

  <p>Then darkness became full of dread. Blair struck a match. Excitement
  glared in Taron Ling's eyes. The match burned Blair's fingers. He struck
  another, trying to see upward.</p>

  <p>"Can you open that from below?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Is there another way out?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Any water?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>The fear of thirst strikes panic. Blair started to climb upward, but Taron
  Ling's hand clutched his ankle. He kicked hard. The man clung; he had the
  strength of a gorilla.</p>

  <p>"You obey," said his voice in the dark, "or you die."</p>

  <p>Blair sat on a step and struck another match. It showed him Taron Ling's
  face, sweat-wet, grinning with intention. Murder? What for? Money? He had
  none.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he demanded. Then the match went out. He struck
  another; there were eight or nine remaining.</p>

  <p>"I will have obedience." said Taron Ling.</p>

  <p>He let go of Blair's ankle and descended backwards on hands and knees into
  total darkness. When the match burned out he spoke:</p>

  <p>"Obey me and live. Disobey me and die. You think"&mdash;his voice throbbed
  and boomed&mdash; "that you were followed here, because you saw a signal. You
  believe those men will come for you. eh? They are Wu Tu's men and Zaman
  Ali's. I taught them the police signals. Is it likely I should take such
  pains to trap you. and neglect that? The commissioner's men and Howland's
  men&mdash;oh yes, yes, I know Howland&mdash;have been misled. That was a
  little silly easy matter. You are at my mercy."</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" Blair repeated. It was no use wishing he had not come.
  It was no use waiting until thirst should begin to torture him. He must use
  his wits while he had any left, and that necessity began to restore his
  self-control.</p>

  <p>"You obey me, not Wu Tu," said Taron Ling's voice.</p>

  <p>Thoughts raced through Blair's brain. Why had Taron Ling deliberately
  quarreled with the Bat-Brahmin? Had there been no other way of inducing the
  man to haul the image back over the hole and shut them in? As for
  thirst&mdash;his mouth was already dry from fear and the heat and the stench
  of bat-filth&mdash; Taron Ling, too, would feel that presently. Judgment, he
  knew, and logic are among the first of the human faculties that wilt and
  vanish under the strain of trespass amid psychic arts that deceive no one
  more than the practitioner. All competent policemen know that. But even a
  professed occultist, persuaded by his own hypnotic skill that he was almost
  superhuman, would be unlikely to defy thirst. Not even a madman would do
  that. Taron Ling did not seem to be quite mad&mdash;yet; the road where
  madness lies in wait is sometimes long and devious.</p>

  <p>He struck another match. Out of the darkness something fell into his lap.
  It was a human skull.</p>

  <p>"Dozens have died in here," said Taron Ling's voice. "This is the secret
  way to Gaglajung that Ranjeet betrayed to the three kings."</p>

  <p>He tossed up another skull, then another. Blair hurled one skull back into
  the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Damn your eyes," he answered, "get going. What's your game? You know a
  way out, that's obvious." He realized quite suddenly, and wondered why he had
  not realized before, that the quarrel had been deliberately timed to make the
  Bat close up the hole as an act of revenge. Possibly the Bat. did not know of
  another way out. Probably he resented the discovery of a secret that he and
  his antecedent impostors in office had kept for centuries. Whatever the
  secret might be, probably the Bat had welcomed an excuse to conceal it again,
  and let the intruders die parched in the dark. Conceivably the Bat had been
  induced to reveal the secret in the first instance? or perhaps the mad hermit
  had been induced to reveal it&mdash;by means of one of Taron Ling's, hypnotic
  tricks. Such tricks bring reaction in their wake. Anger sometimes breaks
  hypnotic spells; it might have stirred the Bat's evident madness to revolt
  and revenge. Taron Ling would surely not have run that risk unless he knew,
  or thought he knew, a way of escape.</p>

  <p>Blair's own competently governed anger began to come to his rescue. Why
  should he have been picked for this job&mdash;he of all people &mdash;he who
  hated all things that can not be stated in plain speech? The commissioner had
  chosen him, knowing his prejudice. Why? Wu Tu had dared to try to hypnotise
  him. Why him? Why had Henrietta treated him as if he were a disappointing
  fool without wit or understanding? What the devil did this beast Taron Ling
  mean by taking such pains to pursue and trap him? Why him? What did it all
  mean? He would find out. Forward, into the trap. Obey orders!</p>

  <p>"Go on!" he commanded. "Lead the way!" There was a sort of vertigo, as he
  resisted a mesmeric effort to make him see things in the dark. He threw that
  off. He went forward, downward, with a hand on either wall and his
  riding-whip ready for action.</p>

  <p>"Careful!" warned Taron Ling's voice. "Here is danger!"</p>

  <p>"Face it then!" he retorted, fighting-angry. He meant to hit the man if he
  could reach him.</p>

  <p>A fight in the dark would be better than views of invisible things that
  crowded the&mdash;darkness, as they do in dreams, memories&mdash;spaceless,
  void, intangible&mdash;the tiger, the shrine, the Bat's face, the hermit's,
  Wu Tu's eyes, the old Rangar and the god Ganesha, the commissioner's
  iron-gray smile&mdash;and then Henrietta.</p>

  <p>"Go on!" he commanded. He would not ask questions. He would make the man
  show him.</p>

  <p>He trod on a rolling bone and almost fell, striking his spur upon the last
  step. He sat down and removed his spurs, began to thrust them in his pocket
  but threw them away savagely. They fell a prodigious distance; it seemed a
  minute before he heard them strike on rock beneath him. Then he heard Taron
  Ling up above him in front, scrambling over loose stones, some of which fell
  and remeasured the depth of the darkness on his left hand.</p>

  <p>He thrust outward to the right with the riding-whip and touched nothing.
  Groping with his foot, he found the bone that had, tripped him. He picked it
  up. It felt like a human thigh-bone. He threw it away to the right. It fell
  what seemed an endless distance before he heard it strike bottom. Evidently
  he was on a ledge between two precipices, and he hated precipices. He got
  down on his hands and knees and crawled forward. The ledge was irregular. In
  one place it was less than a foot wide; but it was only about twenty feet
  long and he soon found a rough, sloping ramp at the end that led sharply
  upward.</p>

  <p>Remembering there were loose stones, he crawled up that carefully,
  pausing, whenever he was sure of his hold, to listen for Taron Ling. But he
  reached smooth, level rock without overtaking the man. Then he stood up and
  reached out his arms in all directions, touching nothing.</p>

  <p>There was no sound. He went forward,, feeling his way with the
  riding-whip. Within a minute he had lost sense of direction. Forward,
  backward, it was all the same fathomless, dark silence. Then he saw the
  monster coming toward him&mdash;the same green-eyed head and belly on eight
  writhing arms that had approached him in front of the tent. If it had been
  real&mdash;if he had thought it was real, he could have faced it with less
  horror. He groped for his matches, and struck one. The thing vanished. Taron
  Ling stood grinning at him, ten feet away.</p>

  <p>The match gave him a glimpse of cavern walls before it burned out and'
  Taron Ling spoke.</p>

  <p>"You are helpless!"</p>

  <p>"Am I?" He charged, striking out with his whip. He struck air twice, and
  with the third blow struck home, following that with his left fist. Then he
  felt himself clutched in frenzied fingers, so he kicked Taron Ling's heel out
  from under him. They fell together, and he heard Taron Ling's head strike the
  rock floor; then the clutch of his fingers relaxed and he lay still.</p>

  <p>Another match. There was blood on the rock. Taron Ling lay dead, with a
  broken skull, with one eye open. Six matches left. Silence. Dreadful
  darkness. Then a fluttering blow in the face. It stank. A bat had struck
  him.</p>

  <p>How do the bats get out of here? he wondered. He wiped the smell of the
  bat off his face and then stepped out with both hands stretched in front of
  him until he found the cavern wall. He felt he had slain a monster, not a
  human being. But what next, alone in all that darkness&mdash;</p>

  <p>Then he had found the cavern wall by groping. Blair counted his remaining
  matches. Six. He struck one. He could not afford enough light to search Taron
  Ling's clothing. The match revealed two dark openings, almost opposite each
  other. He had completely lost sense of direction; in the struggle Taron Ling
  had fallen sideways, not backwards, so that the position of his body afforded
  no clue. He chose the wrong direction and nearly fell down the ramp up which
  he had scrambled five minutes before. That increased his state, of panic, but
  he found the wall again and felt his way along it to the other opening,
  reserving his remaining matches for emergency. It was absolutely pitch-dark.
  He could see nothing&mdash;not even his hand before his eyes; There was not
  even an audible echo until he groped his way out of the cavern and into the
  tunnel. Then the echo, of his footfall began to rumble along ahead of him, as
  if the tunnel were crowded with hurrying men.</p>

  <p>Whistling is one of the ways by which a man can recover his self-control.
  He tried it, and his first effort was merely a Whisper, because his lips were
  dry. The whisper made a sound in the tunnel like a.soft wind. That suggested
  another thought. He wetted one finger as well as his lips, and held up the
  finger. There was a perceptible, although very slight current of air. There
  must be an opening somewhere. His second attempt to whistle was shrill and
  off-key; the sound went shrieking an immeasurable distance, that might be
  miles or might be an illusion due to the formation of the tunnel, the state
  of his own nerves, and the darkness.</p>

  <p>As the hollow shriek faded and died, it resembled a murmur of human voices
  very far off. It occurred to him then for the first time that very likely
  there were other people in the caverns. If so, they must certainly have heard
  him. Taron Ling's behavior was explainable on that supposition. It was
  incredible that he could have set his trap so well without some organized
  assistance. He had boasted that the watchers, whom Blair had mistaken for the
  commissioner's or Howland's undercover men. were Wu Tu's agents; and that was
  conceivably true. If so, others of Wu Tu's agents might be wafting at a
  rendezvous for Taron Ling and perhaps also for himself, for some reason not
  yet evident.</p>

  <p>Assuming that to be true, Taron Ling's motive could be guessed at. Both he
  and Wu Tu had used hypnotic methods. Taron Ling had used a kind of third
  degree, to create a mental condition quite familiar to psychologists, in
  which the victim does what he is told. He had then demanded obedience to
  himself, in place of Wu Tu. She. in Bombay, also had insisted on
  obedience.</p>

  <p>That might even mean, although it was improbable almost to the point of
  impossibility, that Wu Tu herself was somewhere in the caverns, and that she
  and Taron Ling were false allies, at secret cross-purposes. Anyhow, more than
  probably there was a very definite reason why Taron Ling had behaved as he
  did. Presumably he, Blair Warrender, in some way was important in the schemes
  of a number of people, who might be expecting him. In the circumstances that
  was an encouraging thought, and he whistled again, then shouted, <i>"Koi
  hai?"</i></p>

  <p>The shout went thundering along the tunnel like the voice of a multitude,
  until the words lost shape and died away at last in a hollow
  murmur&mdash;oi-ai&mdash;oi-ai&mdash;oi-ai. There was no answer. He waited
  until the ensuing silence, became as" terrifying. as the darkness and he knew
  he must go forward or lose all command of himself. The echo of his first
  footstep made him jump nearly out of skin. He knew then exactly how
  third-degree witnesses feel. He craved even Taron Ling's company.</p>

  <p>He spread his arms on the invisible wall and pressed his whole body
  against it because he felt there was a precipice behind him, although he knew
  there was not. He drove his toes against the wall, as if he stood on a narrow
  ledge with his heels on nothing. Frantically he fought against thought,
  fearing he might begin to see. things in the dark and go mad.</p>

  <p>But the thought of Henrietta intruded, insisted and won. Where was
  Henrietta? Had they brought her to these caverns? If so was she enduring this
  silent darkness? Could he find her? He must find her. There was no other
  picture than Henrietta in his mind after that&mdash;Henrietta on the rock in
  moonlight&mdash; Henrietta in Bombay amid the colored garden-party
  lanterns&mdash;Henrietta at Ganesha's shrine, garlanded amid the shadows,
  watching a mad hermit bless a tiger-skin&mdash;Henrietta with hands over her
  eyes (but he could see the eyes through the hands) in the chair in front of
  his tent&mdash;</p>

  <p>He did not think of himself any more. He thought only of her. Gradually
  the terror loosened its grip. It left him feeling weak-kneed but in command
  of his senses. He began to move forward very slowly, groping his way along
  the wall with his left hand, almost feeling he was not alone, because the
  picture of Henrietta in his thought was so clear and persistent. There was a
  weird, exciting, nervous but not too terrible sensation of following
  Henrietta into the heart of a mystery. The echoes of his own footsteps almost
  made him think he heard her. He remembered speculations such as all men make
  at one time or another. Death, and groping one's way into life after death,
  might be like this. But he stopped after fifty or sixty careful paces and
  leaned on the wall again. That mental image of Henrietta was becoming too
  real. He was beginning to imagine himself dead and in the next world. He was
  losing his mind. So he stood perfectly still, hardly breathing, to let the
  echoes die away in silence. He tried to force himself to think. Here he was,
  a policeman, with a definite job, in a bad predicament. What was the sane
  thing to do? Go back? Climb those steps and try to move Ganesha's image from,
  beneath? He could not imagine himself doing it; nor could he drive the
  picture of Henrietta from his mind. She was somewhere on ahead of him. She
  must be. Without knowledge or reason he knew that, and felt an irresistible
  impulse to go forward and find her.</p>

  <p>Those last echoes were a long time dying; They appeared even to grow
  stronger. There was something added to them&mdash;something with a slap in it
  that, he knew afterward, should have instantly informed him. It was probably
  more than a minute&mdash;an eternity foreshortened&mdash;before he suspected
  the sound of feet in loose slippers approaching. He nearly froze then, into
  immobility.</p>

  <p>When he forced himself to move, his hand trembled so that he could hardly
  get a match out of the box. However, he struck one at last. It gave him a
  glimpse of a tunnel that seemed partly natural and partly hewn through onyx
  or some similar formation. The sound of the approaching footsteps ceased
  before the match went out. He stood still, listening, with the picture of the
  weirdly colored tunnel gradually fading from his eyes.</p>

  <p>He could hear nothing. But after a minute, or perhaps two minutes, dim
  light crept toward him along the left-hand wall of the tunnel, at a point
  some distance off, where it curved to the right and sloped upward. The light
  was not quite steady. He felt reasonably sure it came from an electric torch
  in someone's hand. It grew no stronger, and moved no farther along the tunnel
  wall; and because of the curve of the wall it left a diagonal zone of total
  darkness. It might be possible to creep along that dark zone unseen, and to
  peer around the curve before showing himself. He decided to make the
  attempt.</p>

  <p>But his nerves were in no shape for still hunting; it was very difficult
  to move without making a noise. He tried to move on tiptoe, but his sinews
  trembled. At the first sound he made, the light was switched off suddenly. He
  made a dash for it then, awakening a thousand booming echoes and reaching the
  opposite wall while the distance to the right-hand curve was still sharply
  impressed on his mind.</p>

  <p>By groping his way along the wall he reached the bulge of the curve almost
  before the picture of it had faded from his eyes. There he waited, hardly
  breathing, flattened against the wall; and after a long wait the light came
  on again. There was a perceptible sound; he thought he recognized the faint
  click of the switch of an electric torch. But it might be a trigger.</p>

  <p>He lay down then, as close to the wall as he could crowd himself, and very
  gradually crawled until he could see around the corner. Someone was holding a
  powerful light at the top of a long slope. He appeared to be sitting and
  holding the light on his knees to keep it steady. Not improbably he had a
  firearm in the other hand, but it was impossible to see beyond the light; it
  had a big lens and might be electric, or, even an acetylene bicycle lamp. It
  revealed the floor and walls of the sharply rising tunnel in minute detail,
  including a huge zigzag shadow that crossed the floor from side to side and
  seemed to indicate a chasm. It looked like a split caused by an
  earthquake.</p>

  <p>He memorized its position carefully, estimating the number of steps he
  should take to reach it. He judged there would be a jump of about for or five
  feet to be made, up-hill, at the narrowest part of the chasm near where it
  touched and split the right-hand wall. It would be a desperate jump to have
  to take if the man should switch the' light off.</p>

  <p><i>"Koi hai!"</i> he shouted, and then hugged the floor, pressed flat,
  half expecting a bullet. He could not catch a word of the answer because it
  was all confused by echoes. He could not even tell what language it was
  spoken in, although it was certainly not English. It was a short
  answer&mdash;six or eight words; Then the light was switched off, and when it
  reappeared it had grown dim in the distance.</p>

  <p>He got to his feet in a hurry; he coy Id no longer see the chasm in the
  middle of the upward slope of the tunnel floor; there was merely an unsteady
  pale light up above and beyond, to show that someone who carried the light
  was moving away rapidly. If he was expected to follow, there was no time to
  waste.</p>

  <p>He started to climb up the slope on his hands and knees. It was quite dark
  when he reached the chasm; he had to feel for it. Groping for the far edge
  with his riding-whip he discovered that the gap was wider than he had
  estimated. He could just touch the edge with the end of the whip, and it was
  three or three-and-a-half feet higher than the place where he must jump off.
  Measuring again and feeling about in the dark for a narrower place, he
  dropped the riding-whip. It seemed like an eternity before the echo of its
  fall came cracking upward, and the very echo seemed to stink of death.</p>

  <p>To hesitate then would be fatal, he knew that. Thirst was beginning to
  torture him, and he knew his nerve would give way if he gave it half an
  opportunity. He set both feet on the brink of the chasm and sprang so
  violently that his feet slipped backward, reducing the impetus. He fell
  waist-high on the upper ledge with his fingers scrambling madly at smooth
  rock and his legs dangling in the chasm. He could touch nothing with his
  feet; they seemed to weigh a ton apiece and to be dragging him downward, but
  his fingers found a crack in the rock and he held on.</p>

  <p>Little by little he worked himself upward until he lay panting with his
  feet on solid rock. He lay there until pain in his fingers, knees and elbows
  grew more acute than the imagination of the danger he had just escaped. He
  had broken nothing but he was skinned and bruised. He crawled on upward,
  rising to his feet before he reached the summit, because near the top of the
  slope he could see the light again, very dim in the distance. It occurred to
  him then to wait there and see what happened. But the suffocating heat,
  emotion, and his own effort had dried his mouth and throat until the thirst
  was almost unendurable. Like all men who have had previous experience of
  thirst, he dreaded that more than any other form of torment.</p>

  <p>He caught himself wondering what he would pay for a drink&mdash;to what
  extent he would betray himself, his friends and his principles in order to
  get one. Had he any principles? He would sell his soul for a drink, and no
  bones about it. Could a man sell his own soul under torture? Would the
  bargain hold? He would have to find that out. And Henrietta? Damn all
  intuition! What had the commissioner called it&mdash;eye-washed lazy
  thinking! He had pursued a mirage of Henrietta.</p>

  <p>He was glad it was a mirage. He did not wish to find her&mdash;not now.
  Why not? Because what damned right had she to see him in this condition? She
  was only entitled to see him as he chose to show himself&mdash;Blair
  Warrender, determined, resolute, secretive, captain of his soul and master of
  his fate within the limits imposed by the Indian Penal Code, his oath of
  service and the various acts and decrees of the viceroy in council.</p>

  <p>He would much rather parade himself naked in the Byculla Club and take the
  consequences than let Henrietta see him lacking in self-control. Why? Damned
  if he knew why. Forward&mdash;feeling slightly, better, more angry, less
  bewildered, very angry indeed with Henrietta. Damn her, why couldn't she have
  told him what she knew, or what she guessed, when he gave her the
  opportunity?</p>

  <p class="quote">&mdash;From the Second of the Nine Books of Noor
  Ali.</p><br>

  <p class="first">BLAIR'S EYES began to grow accustomed to the dimness as he
  followed the man with the light, not attempting to overtake him. He did try
  to shout to him once, but his parched throat made only unintelligible sounds
  and it seemed stupid to repeat the effort, much wiser to reserve his
  remaining energy. His thirst was increased by a weird sensation of being
  under water at great depth. His clothes and riding-boots felt like a heavy
  diving-suit. There should be no sound under water, but the hollow echoes
  somehow or other increased the suggestion. Bats, occasionally glimpsed, were
  like swift fish swimming.</p>

  <p>The tunnel wound like a snake. It was certainly hewn out and widened in
  places, but it appeared to follow what originally was a watercourse in the
  heart of the mountain, although there was not a trace of dampness. There
  began to be a lot of stalagmite formation that took fantastic shapes like the
  faces of monstrous men and animals. The floor of the tunnel was filthy with
  bats' excreta. The dust was stifling; it made breathing difficult. The dust
  kicked up by the man ahead hung suspended in air, and the light appeared
  through that as dim as moonlight on the sea floor.</p>

  <p>He had lost all sense of time, distance and direction when the light at
  last began to grow stronger. It was still dim with dust, but more golden and
  suggested daylight. Presently he felt fresher air on his face. That revived
  him a little, although the air was dry and hot and if anything it increased
  his thirst. There was such a singing in his cars that he could hardly hear
  his own footsteps.</p>

  <p>When he stood still for a moment he could hear nothing ahead of him in the
  tunnel. When he went on again he discovered the tunnel made two sharp turns,
  which might account for his not hearing the other man's footsteps. The second
  turn brought him face to face with brilliant sunlight that poured through a
  huge fanged break in the mountain wall, like a monster's mouth, two or three
  hundred feet away and fifty feet above him.</p>

  <p>Dazzled by the glimpse of blue sky, he could see almost, nothing else tor
  a moment. There was a big boulder almost blocking the mouth of the tunnel; he
  stood in the shadow of that and leaned against it, protecting his eyes with
  both hands. The fierce light looked liquid where it met the floor&mdash;a
  layer of liquid silver on soot-black ink. Dust particles in the air increased
  the suggestion of sediment formed on the floor of a pond. After a while he
  traced a winding track across the soot-black floor; it led from the tunnel
  out of which he had come, toward what looked like blackened masonry on the
  far side. The track had evidently been made by human footsteps. But why did
  it curve?</p>

  <p>Some of the blackness changed to ash-gray as he stared at it. He began to
  be able to see the discolored walls of a cavern. Soon after that he
  discovered that his hands were blackened by something resembling soot. So was
  his clothing. The walls of the cavern took shadowy shape, and though he could
  not see the roof he could guess at the size of the place, it was not
  enormous&mdash;perhaps sixty or seventy feet long by a hundred wide.
  Something hung from the roof; apparently it was a blackened chain, with
  rust-red showing through a covering of soot; it suggested a trapdoor up
  there, or at any rate some kind of, opening.</p>

  <p>Almost suddenly it occurred to him that he might be beneath the keep of
  Gaglajung. This might be the place where munitions&mdash;more probably
  firewood&mdash;had been stored. Such a fortress would need enormous
  quantities of fuel in case of siege. If the legend were true; if Ranjeet's
  consort actually had immolated herself and her women rather than surrender
  the place, what easier way had she than to set fire to the store of fuel?
  That would have served a double purpose by preventing the three kings from
  forcing an entrance through the secret tunnel, supposing it were true that
  Ranjeet under torture had betrayed its secret.</p>

  <p>There were signs everywhere of the effects of tremendous heat. He took the
  winding track across the floor and his feet fell iii almost silence on a
  thick carpet of charcoal and ashes. He discovered then why the track was not
  straight; it avoided lumps of blackened wood, and other things. There was a
  skull, for instance, as black as charcoal, grinning upward with blackened
  teeth; It was a small skull and might be a woman's. There were blackened
  rib-bones. He detected about half of a human spine. In another place a
  forearm and part of a hand, as black as ebony, lay on something that looked
  like a half-burned stump of a sawn tree.</p>

  <p>Stepping incautiously as he stared about him, he trod on a thigh-bone that
  cracked and crumbled into dust. Acrid ash-dust rose from beneath his feet,
  however carefully he walked. It nearly choked him. He was half blinded by it
  before he reached the far side, but he could see that the discolored masonry
  had cracked as&mdash; the result of fire;, enough of it had fallen to leave a
  gap through which it was easy to pass without touching the sides. Until he
  approached it closely the gap looked like a fluke of sunlight on the
  blackened wall. Actually light shone through the gap. There was a sensation
  as of someone lurking in wait on the far side. But by that time he would have
  plunged through fire in the hope of finding water anywhere beyond it.</p>

  <p>He had passed a whole night without sleep. He had killed a man in gruesome
  circumstances and had suffered horrors of imagination. But his ravening
  thirst was worse than all that. If he had known for a fact that ten men
  lurked in ambush, and that they intended to tear him in pieces, he would
  nevertheless have gone forward.</p>

  <p>He stepped through and found himself in what was once a rock-hewn temple
  naturally, formed of stalactite and stalagmite, some of which had been
  fantastically carved into semi-human shapes. The place was quite small. At
  the far end was a huge lingam on an altar of stalagmite. Beside that was a
  wide doorway with remains of the decayed woodwork still wedged into slots in
  the smooth rock wall. Almost staggeringly unexpected, stock-still in the
  doorway, waiting for him, staring at him, stood Zaman Ali, in a thin cotton
  shirt, with, a knife at his waist. His face was filthy with sweat-streaked
  soot. He had a revolver in one hand, and in the other he carried an
  engineer's electric lantern that had an enormous lens. He flashed the light
  on, full in Blair's face.</p>

  <p>"So you come alone!" he said in Pushtu, rather indistinctly. He, too, had
  dust in a dry throat. "Mashallah, this world is full of wonders! Allah's will
  be done&mdash;but have you robbed me of the chance to be the agent of it?
  Where is Taron Ling?"</p>

  <p>Blair could not have forced himself to speak intelligibly. His throat was
  burning. But he would not have answered in any event. He was actually less
  conscious of thirst now that he had a concrete enemy to tackle. There was not
  much risk of Zaman Ali using the revolver&mdash;not if Zaman Ali, as seemed
  certain, wanted him there in the heart of a mountain alive, for some purpose
  or other. He craved water. Undoubtedly Zaman Ali knew where water could be
  found, and that was the first problem, but it might not be wise to let the
  Afghan know how serious it was. He tried to close his lips, breathe calmly
  and look like a man with information and resources in reserve as he strode
  toward him.</p>

  <p>Zaman Ali laughed. It was a snarl and a sneer combined, but there was
  humor in it cruel humor that anticipated triumph. "There are streams of cool
  water," he said, "in paradise. So it is written. There is water of secret
  springs in this grave of devils. Thirst is stronger than devils. It is
  stronger than fear or wisdom."</p>

  <p>He stood aside. Through the wide doorway at his back came three of the men
  whom Blair had seen at Wu Tu's in Bombay. One was the owner of the
  brown-and-white shoes and the blackjack, who had looked absurd in striped
  socks. He was wearing the shoes now; they were filthy and so was his shirt.
  He was wild-eyed with excitement.</p>

  <p>"Have you a weapon?" he asked in. English, snapping the words out, peering
  into Blair's face. "No," he said over his shoulder, "he has no weapon." Then
  he produced the little blackjack from inside his shirt. He slapped it on the
  palm of his left hand. "I have this," he said, showing his teeth. "You are
  acquainted with its efficacy. Are you thirsty?" He slapped the weapon on his
  hand a second time. "If you are already very thirsty, that is a
  simplification. We had thought we might be forced to wait until tomorrow.
  There is no water exactly here. Do you want any? I could get it."</p>

  <p>"Where is Taron Ling?" repeated Zaman Ali. Blair stood silent. The man
  with the blackjack was of a perfectly familiar type. He was capable of any
  cruelty; equally incapable of sympathy or real courage. There was nothing on
  earth to be gained by arguing with him. He was within reach. It might have
  been possible to knock him out with a sudden hook to the jaw, or to trip and
  fall on him; but to attempt to do either, and fail, was to invite intelligent
  but bestial revenge. Zaman Ali was the only real man,in sight. A rogue, yes.
  A ruthless, sly, not improbably treacherous, and certainly shameless
  scoundrel. But a man. Well hidden, but discoverable somewhere in his
  character were principles for which Zaman Ali would be willing to die in his
  boots. All the others were human jackals. Blair strode up to Zaman Ali and
  the Afghan understood that perfectly. He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Aye," he said, "this is an issue between thee and me." He turned fiercely
  on the others and ordered them back whence they came, using scurrilous words
  that, where he came from, would have set Death on tiptoe for the harvest. But
  he had a revolver and they had none. They retreated grinning, as if it were a
  good joke to hear their mothers' memory reviled. Then Zaman Ali shrugged his
  shoulders, with a sour look at the lingam on the ancient altar:</p>

  <p>"Curses on such a religion!" he muttered. Then, more loudly, "But there is
  a secret here worth plucking forth. I have sold drink dear in my day, but by
  God, Blair Warrender, today's price is the highest!"</p>

  <p>Somewhere beyond the doorway, someone began pouring water from one vessel
  into another. It splashed delightfully.</p>

  <p>"And there is salt," said Zaman Ali. "I have seen more than one man,
  trussed within sight and sound of water, given salt to eat. If I remember
  rightly, it was not too long before they chose between alternatives. There is
  the other Salt, of the oath one man makes to another. Choose thou between
  them, Blair Warrender!"</p>

  <p>The Afghan kept well out of arm's reach. The sight of knife and revolver
  was unlikely to restrain a man whom thirst had maddened, but Blair was not
  nearly maddened yet, and the Afghan knew it. He evidently did not wish to use
  his weapons; he wished to bargain. The splashing of water implied that his
  men were listening for a cue to rush in and very swiftly stop any fight that
  Blair might offer. Whatever Zaman Ali's motive might be, he evidently wanted
  Blair alive and uninjured for some definite purpose. But Blair had a good
  excuse for not trying to speak, and he made the most of it. He waited in
  silence for Zaman Ali to unmask motive. Zaman Ali stared into his smouldering
  eyes:</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you have the heart to die of thirst," he said after a long pause.
  "But by my beard I see no sense in it." He laughed curtly. "I have seen
  obstinate men die of torture."</p>

  <p>The windy look came into his eyes, as if he stared at a hard horizon.
  "Allah only knows what gain they won.of that. Die, if you like, Blair
  Warrender. I have the giving of death; I will give without flinching. Thou
  and I, it may be, are two of one wilfulness. But in the matter of a choice
  between betrayals, only Allah, who knoweth all things, knows what a tortured
  man will choose."</p>

  <p>He switched the light off. Dim daylight, through the openings at either
  end of the little temple, created gloom amid which the carved stalactite
  monsters on the walls grinned like gray ideas half-visioned in a waking
  dream. The splashing of water increased perceptibly. The sooty sweat on Zaman
  Ali's face exaggerated the seams of savagery, and the pupils of his eyes
  grew" large but lost no hardness.</p>

  <p>"Do you understand," he said, "that you were driven hither, as they drove
  that tiger to your gun in the night? That was a long task and expensive. God
  be my witness, I was against employing Taron Ling. But Wu Tu took the bit in
  her teeth and was worse to manage than a mad mare. <i>I</i> would have put
  the torture to you there in Bombay, but Wu Tu would have none of it: and by
  Allah, having some experience of women, and of Wu Tu, I perceived there was
  more than one blade to the knife of her argument. So I used your pass and
  Chetusingh's to draw the police off my trail; and I came hither.</p>

  <p>"Your trail&mdash;Wu Tu was right about that&mdash; was as easy to
  foretell as a colt's when the mares are up-wind. seeing how Wu Tu had forced
  an" issue by sending to the papers news that Frennisham is missing. There was
  none except you likely to be sent to question Frennisham's daughter. None
  other can bridle that filly, unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused. He appeared to wish to feel out prejudices and to find a
  compromise between them. He was telling too much, for a man who felt he held
  the whiphand. Blair gave him no
  help&mdash;waited&mdash;watched&mdash;betrayed no curiosity. But he perfectly
  understood that Zaman Ali meant to go the limit if argument failed. There was
  a stiff proposition coming. The alternative to torture was likely to be
  nothing easy. He began to see Wu Tu's eyes again, and that worried him
  because it might mean he was losing self-control. His only imaginable chance
  was that delay might bring some of the commissioner's or Howland's men to the
  rescue. But Zaman Ali guessed that thought was in his mind.</p>

  <p>"The police hunt for me in Calcutta," he said. "They who followed this
  trail have been dealt with. They are dead. Die thou of thirst here, and none
  will know it. But such a death will serve what purpose&mdash; Allah! I would
  rather watch thee dying than see the woman in the same case! Be that on your
  head! The sahiba's torment shall begin where yours ends! Some men say that
  women are less than dogs; but I am not of that number. I say women vary; and
  it may be one of them now and again is worth a man's life and everything else
  that he has."</p>

  <p>The water splashed again. Zaman Ali strode to the doorway and someone put
  a brass goblet of water into his outstretched hand. He swilled out his mouth,
  drank deep, shook the remaining drops on the dry floor, returned the empty
  goblet and again faced Blair.</p>

  <p>"Henrietta Frennisham sahiba," he said slowly, "is at your mercy&mdash;if
  you have any. As for me, I have none, "excepting at a high price."</p>

  <p>Blair took a step backward and leaned against the ancient altar, partly
  because his face was then in deeper shadow; but he also knew he needed
  physical support if he was not to show how scared he felt. If it was true
  that Henrietta was in danger of being tortured, he could not help her,
  himself or anyone by choosing death first rather than yield to the Afghan's
  demands.&mdash;But it was not yet time to admit that. The thirst that he
  already felt" was sufficiently fierce to tax will power, and he. knew from
  previous experience that it was nothing compared to what was coming unless he
  could get water soon. He might have the strength to endure it and die. But
  could he leave her to that fate?</p>

  <p>"There is a secret here," said Zaman Ali. "and she has it. If she has not,
  she can get it. If she will not, she will die. his thy task. Bee-lair
  Warrender, to break that filly to the rein and get the secret. Do it. and
  both of you have my leave to live. Fail, and you die. By Allah, that is the
  whole story."</p>

  <p>He came closer and stood watching Blair's face. Then he went to the
  doorway, demanded water, spilled half of the contents of the little goblet on
  the floor and offered the rest to Blair.</p>

  <p>"Drink," he said. "Then answer. That is your last drink, until you and I
  agree together."</p>

  <p>Blair moistened his mouth. Then he drank and set the empty goblet on the
  altar beside the lingam.</p>

  <p>"Where is Taron Ling?" Zaman Ali demanded. It was the third time he had
  asked that question. Blair decided not to answer it.</p>

  <p>"Wait and see," he said, testing his voice. It was very important to speak
  calmly if he possibly could. Nothing tells in the East more strongly in a
  man's favor than a level voice in poignant circumstances. Nothing gives a man
  better command of himself. His voice came hoarsely from his throat, but it
  still had some quality.</p>

  <p>Zaman Ali's eyes glanced anxiously at the gap in the broken masonry. He
  seemed afraid Taron Ling might enter. His hand closed tight on his revolver
  butt. He even stepped to the gap, peered through and paused to listen. Then
  he returned and stared at Blair's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Did you make a bargain with him?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Blair clung to his resolution not to answer. The Afghan's fear was
  probably more deadly than his greed, but there was a long chance, perhaps one
  in a thousand, that fear of Taron Ling might make him easier to manage.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;and that dog of a devil&mdash;agreed on&mdash; what?" Zaman Ali
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"No matter what."</p>

  <p>That was Wu Tu's voice&mdash;unmistakably hers. Something moved in the
  gloom behind Zaman Ali and the voice continued, "Trust an Afghan to flinch
  from a <i>dugpa</i>! Out of the way and let me handle him!" She was
  half-invisible against the stalagmite behind her. She peered through the
  folds of a sari that shrouded her head and shoulders, looking unexpectedly
  small beside Zaman Ali's bulk&mdash;small, frail, vital. Her eyes were a
  determined devil's. She kept out of Blair's reach. "Who cares what Taron Ling
  did? Watch what I do! If he disobeys me, tie him and bring the salt." She
  advanced a step closer. "Are you willing to obey me?"</p>

  <p>Blair's eyes smoldered and grew calm again. It was useless to defy her
  openly: Zaman Ali and his men could overwhelm him in a moment, and Wu Tu
  would have less compunction than a tigress. But could he deceive her? He
  avoided her stare for a moment and then met it suddenly, as if trying to read
  her mind. His own was made up.</p>

  <p>"I made you an offer," she said, "in Bombay. I repeat it for the last
  time. To the top of the tree&mdash;power&mdash;all you wish!&mdash;if you
  obey me. Otherwise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Why, if she had such secret power, did she need a mere policeman's will in
  submission to hers? He was no such fool as to believe she was in love with
  him, but she was doing tricks with her eyes now, making them look seductive,
  feline-fierce and feline-amorous, darkly purposeful and moody with
  anticipation. Zaman Ali clucked a disapproving tongue against his teeth. He
  disliked any sort of magic, even for his own ends. But he was either afraid
  of Wu Tu or else he feared to oppose her for some other reason.</p>

  <p>"In the name of the Nine-and-Ninety Names of the Almighty Lord of heaven
  and earth and all that is," he muttered. Wu Tu, shrouded in thin silk
  drapery, came one step nearer, radiating perfume. "You surrender?"</p>

  <p>There was a long pause, and then:</p>

  <p>"Yes," Blair answered. He felt better and knew he had acted wisely the
  moment he said it. It was mental ju-jitsu. The difficulty, now, would be to
  act that spoken lie and not to disillusion her too soon. The triumph in her
  eyes betrayed her. Zaman Ali muttered his doubt half-audibly. But she, in the
  heart of her vain heart, believed her hypnotic will had won.</p>

  <p>"No, no, no drink for him yet!" said Wu Tu.</p>

  <p>He of the blackjack had hurried in with a big brass jar of water, seeking
  to ingratiate himself by being first with it, believing Blair's star was how
  in the ascendant. Blair made a mental note of the man's craving to be
  important. Rebuked, he pretended he had only come to add to Blair's
  discomfort. He splashed water on the floor and grinned spitefully. Zaman Ali
  drove him out, cursing his mother's religion in terms of concrete
  imagery.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu promptly dismissed Zaman Ali, who resented it. He had no use for
  being ordered to-and-fro by women, and he also resented having had Blair
  snatched, as it were, from the fangs of his own intention. After a muttered
  altercation the Afghan swaggered out, slapping his slippers on the smooth
  stone as a soft of obligato to scurrilous thought. Outside, he kicked
  someone; there was an explosion of savage oaths followed by the snarl of a
  fight that died unborn. In spite of thirst and exhaustion Blair began to feel
  decidedly less discouraged. There was a rift in the enemy's ranks, but he
  masked his awareness of that.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu stood more than the length of a stride away, confident but careful.
  The suffocating heat provided a good excuse to throw open the dark silk saris
  that shrouded her figure. Beneath those was a mere film of gauzy material,
  that shone like opal. It limned her figure. She was almost naked. She shook
  the sari from her coiled, dark hair and, possibly because the light was dim
  and from two directions, she looked suddenly young, but curiously Chinese.
  Her perfume suggested lavender, but it was something much more subtly
  exciting;, it stirred imagination.</p>

  <p>"And now." she said, "we befriend each other&mdash; Eh, Blair?"</p>

  <p>He nodded. "You hold all the high cards."</p>

  <p>"But you are treacherous! You intend to learn my secret&mdash;afterwards
  to see me at the devil&mdash;is it not so? Eh, Blair?"</p>

  <p>He suspected he was in the deadliest danger he had ever been in. He did
  not know yet what the danger was, but he did know he had to deceive her and
  to gain her confidence by some means. Her accurate reading of his thought
  might not be entirely guesswork. She intended to control him. That was
  obvious. She certainly believe she had hypnotised him in her house in Bombay,
  and to a limited extent she was right; he had been unable to banish the
  mental image of her eyes.</p>

  <p>That trick was nothing wonderful. It was not nearly as wonderful as Taron
  Ling's. It was as easy to explain as ineradicable memories of scenes glimpsed
  in an explosion and photographed.on the brain. But it might be a key to a
  system of thought-reading; and if so, it should work both ways. If she could
  read his thought by that means, or in consequence of that, then perhaps he
  could read her. He deliberately recalled that vision of her eyes that had
  been so persistent. It was quite easy; he could see them without looking away
  from her. At once he thought he knew what she intended.</p>

  <p>His eyes searched her loosened sari. In one of its folds he saw the handle
  of a little dagger that resembled the one he had taken away from her in
  Bombay. It might even be the same dagger.</p>

  <p>Nothing is swifter than thought. Not for nothing did her name in Chinese
  mean Five Poisons. There crossed his mind a memory of certain wasps. They
  capture insects, sting them, paralyze them, and devour them later. It was a
  blood-curdling thought. That might not after all have been alcohol within the
  blade of Wu Tu's little dagger that night in Bombay. He had guessed it was
  alcohol, and he had told the commissioner it was, but he might have been
  wrong.</p>

  <p>He had heard&mdash;who has not?&mdash;of eastern poisons that are said to
  paralyze a victim's will but leave him otherwise in full possession of his
  senses. Everything has its opposite. Curare is a well known drug that
  paralyzes the motor centers, but leaves brain and nerves intensely sensitive.
  If Wu Tu should possess a drug that was the opposite of that? He decided to
  possess that dagger and he took a stride toward her, smiling. He remembered
  the name she had asked him to use. But his mouth was dry again. He found
  words difficult.</p>

  <p>"Let's forget what a bloody fool I was that night, Marie. I've thought it
  over. I'll play."</p>

  <p>"Yes." she answered. But she avoided his arms. She stepped back very
  quickly into shadow. When he followed her, he saw that Zaman Ali and three
  other men could now see him through the doorway. He was between two lights,
  whereas she was in opal gloom. He had missed.</p>

  <p>Had she read his intention? Probably. But she disguised her motive.</p>

  <p>"No, no, not now! You are filthy. Your face is sooty and. dusty.
  Besides&mdash;no, not in this place!"</p>

  <p>She moved like a leopard. Perfume passed between him and the monstrously
  figured wall. He hardly saw her until she beckoned to him from beside Zaman
  Ali. Far beyond her, at the end of a tunnel, daylight poured in a golden
  cascade, apparently into a huge circular pit: but that strong light and the
  weirdly colored gloom this side of it were so baffling that he could make out
  very little except her figure.</p>

  <p>He strode through the opening toward her, but turned aside suddenly and
  made for the brass water-jar. The owner of the blackjack crouched beside it.
  At a sign from Wu Tu he upset it and the water became mud on the lusty floor.
  With almost the greatest effort of self-control he had exerted yet, Blair
  retrained from kicking him. The man's capacity for treachery might prove
  valuable later on, and meanwhile he was not worth kicking.</p>

  <p>"Give him the other," Wu Tu commanded.</p>

  <p>He who had spilled the water produced a flask labelled <i>Fine Cognac</i>
  and unscrewed the stopper. Zaman Ali grumbled:</p>

  <p>"Wah! Wall! Do you want him frenzied? What if he has made terms with Taron
  Ling?"</p>

  <p>Blair accepted the flask. With his mind on Zaman Ali but his eyes on Wu
  Tu, he poured the contents on the rock floor, where they mingled with the
  mud. The stuff looked like cognac, but its smell was not quite familiar, or
  he thought not.</p>

  <p>"Damn you." he said to Wu Tu. "Zaman Ali plays a straight game. Yours is
  feline treachery."</p>

  <p>He seized the water-jar. There were a few drops unspilled. He drank. He
  could not see around the big jar while he held it to his mouth but no one
  took advantage of his being off-guard for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I say, risk it as he is," Zaman Ali grumbled. "He may be better as he is.
  If Taron Ling has taught him anything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Leave him to me," Wu Tu retorted.</p>

  <p>The Afghan clucked impatience: "To you! To you! He is a man, this fellow.
  He and I can understand each other. What did you do to the other? Spoiled
  him! Now spoil this one? Then what?"</p>

  <p>Vague though it was, that might be a hint of Chetusingh's fate. Spoiled
  him? What did that mean? Torture? Blair set down the water-jar and stared at
  Wu Tu. She was muttering at Zaman Ali, looking angrier than he had seen a
  human being. It was cold, malignant, calculating anger. He watched her right
  hand steal into the folds of her sari. Suddenly she struck with the speed of
  a snake at the Afghan's liver. He shrieked&mdash;fear, agony, hatred&mdash;a
  yell that wailed along the tunnel. Instinct made him try to draw his own
  knife instead of using the revolver, but the owner of the blackjack struck
  him a terrific blow on the back of the head. In a spasm he fired the revolver
  as he fell, and missed Wu Tu by the width of the film of light that edged her
  bare neck. Blair was swift then. He possessed that revolver before the echo
  of the shot had rattled into silence. He made a dive for it. Wu Tu's knife
  was in the Afghan's liver. She was helpless to do anything but gasp
  excitedly.</p>

  <p>The blackjack's owner swung for the back of Blair's head. Two other men
  rushed him. He dodged them all, kicked the revolver, dribbled it along the
  tunnel for a few yards and picked it up before they could overtake him. He
  had no need to threaten them then; they backed away, watching him like cats
  as he stood, now, with his back to the strong light. He examined the weapon.
  Its six chambers contained five cartridges, and of those, four had been used.
  Perhaps Wu Tu already knew that, but there was no need to inform her if she
  did not know. The obvious next thing to do was to search Zaman Ali's body tor
  cartridges; but Wu Tu had already recovered her thin-bladed dagger and was
  first at the spoils. She knelt beside the Afghan, listening to him, watching,
  glancing once or twice at Blair but seeming undisturbed by the fact that he
  now had a weapon. She searched the Afghan's clothing diligently while he
  stared at her with glazed eyes&mdash;groaned, gasped, made sounds that
  perhaps he thought were words. Apparently Wu Tu failed to find what she
  looked for. She glanced at Blair again and seemed about to speak. As her lips
  moved Zaman Ali died in a spasm of agony.</p>

  <p>There was a sound, and Blair faced about suddenly. Behind him&mdash;close
  to him&mdash;almost within reach&mdash;in shoes soled with thick
  felt&mdash;was the Chinese girl who had opened the door at the head of the
  stairs in the house in Bombay. He turned just in time to see the cigarette in
  its long tube return to her lips. It was a half finished cigarette and there
  was ash on the end. Her eyes were inscrutable, her face expressionless, but
  he was almost sure he had seen her right hand move; four fingers of it were
  now in the blue-and-daffodil pyjama jacket pocket, with the long-nailed thumb
  outside. She looked too innocent. She made as if to pass him without a
  greeting.</p>

  <p>He stood back against the wall as if to let her pass, but the moment she
  moved he stepped forward again, seized her left arm that was nearest to
  him&mdash;the one that held the cigarette. She tried to strike then, with a
  weapon exactly like Wu Tu's. But its blade passed through the bottom of the
  pocket inside her pyjamas. Its handle caught the pocket lining. It came out
  awkwardly. She missed. Before she could stab a second time she was on her
  back on the ground, Blair's foot was on the dagger and there was a little
  stream of liquid oozing from its broken blade.</p>

  <p>Then, for a fraction of a second, Wu Tu betrayed nervousness. She glanced
  about her swiftly and her own right hand crept to the folds of her sari. But
  there was Blair's revolver, and her eyes considered that. There were three
  men between her and Blair; she seemed to doubt them more than him. They were
  Zaman Ali's followers. True, one of them had blackjacked Zaman Ali, but her
  glance showed how little she trusted him. She rose slowly from her knees, and
  age seemed to have stolen a march on her; but she overcame that in a moment,
  and when she smiled the telltale years had already vanished like a shadow
  that had passed over a young face.</p>

  <p>"You and I befriend each other, eh, Blair? Let that girl up. What did you
  do with Taron Ling?"</p>

  <p>"You will find out." he answered. "Where's Henrietta Frensham?"</p>

  <p>The Chinese girl tried to wrench the broken dagger from under his foot.
  Failing to do it, she crawled away from him, then rose to her feet and walked
  toward Wu Tu with perfectly assumed indifference. She had not lost her
  cigarette tube; she stuck in a fresh cigarette and lighted it very slowly,
  walking past the owner of the blackjack, answering his leer with a stare that
  made him change it into a grin like a starved wolf's; he glanced from her to
  Blair and back again.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu gave her little dagger to the Chinese girl, who wiped it carefully
  on Zaman Ali's turban. Wu Tu took it back without glancing, at it and hid it
  away in, a fold of her sari.</p>

  <p>"Now you and I can be really friendly! Are you thirsty? You shall drink
  now. There is no need any longer to defer to a dog of an Afghan."</p>

  <p>Her slipper came off as she kicked dead Zaman Ali. The Chinese girl
  returned it to her.</p>

  <p class="quote">The test of strength is silence. Remember: I said strength,
  not goodness. I know not the measure of goodness. But the strong love
  silence, in which the weak reveal weakness by clamor and boast and lament.
  The test of character is mystery. Integrity, in presence of a mystery, awaits
  imagination's touch that, like the dawn upon the darkness, solves night's
  riddle. But the vain revile all mystery. And why not? For it challenges,
  their vanity, that might lie longer hidden if it could endure the strain of
  silence in the presence of truth dimly seen but not yet known or
  understood.</p>

  <p class="quote">&mdash;From the First of the Nine Books of Noor Ali.</p><br>

  <p class="first">BLAIR walked slowly toward Wu Tu, wondering whether she or
  any of the others knew there was only one shot left in the revolver. Midway
  toward her he confronted the owner of the blackjack who stepped forward
  smiling. He was not obsequious, but polite; he salaamed with one hand to his
  forehead, holding the blackjack in the other.</p>

  <p>"You appear to be master of the situation, sahib," he said in English.</p>

  <p>"Quite so. Give me your weapon."</p>

  <p>The man glanced at Wu Tu. She watched Blair.</p>

  <p>"Shoot him," she suggested.</p>

  <p>Two other men slunk away into the gloom where the wall projected and cast
  deep shadow. Suddenly they took to their heels. They scampered like scared
  rats through the temple and out through the gap in the broken wall into the
  ash-floored cavern where the bones of burned women lay. A third man went and
  stood near Wu Tu. He of the blackjack hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You should know me," he said. "I am well known to the police. I am from
  Dur-i-Duran Singh of Naga Kulu. I am Grish Singh. I am Dur-i-Duran sahib's
  agent. I know all about this, I assure you. I will tell everything. But you
  should shoot her."</p>

  <p>Blair kept his eyes on the man's face. He expected treachery and
  cobra-suddenness. He was ready for it. But if he could, he proposed to save
  that one bullet. He could deal with this beast with his fist if
  necessary.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear me? Hand over your weapon."</p>

  <p>Instead of obeying, the man took a step backward. Blair still hesitated to
  use that one remaining bullet. Grish Singh, as he called himself, began
  talking at top speed:</p>

  <p>"Don't be unwise&mdash;listen to me&mdash;let me show
  you&mdash;Dur-i-Duran Singh of Naga Kulu is my master&mdash;he
  will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he, too, tried to bolt for it, but he did not get far. As he
  turned he screamed and threw up both hands. With his back toward Blair he
  beat at someone's brains. In that weird, mixed light it was difficult to tell
  what happened. That other man. who had slunk away into the gloom, had
  evidently taken Zaman Ali's long knife. Perhaps Wu Tu gave it to him. He had
  crept up from behind and used it. Grish Singh tell writhing, with blood
  blubbering and foaming from his mouth. The other, with blackjacked brains on
  his face, lay still beneath him. It was all over in a moment. Grish Singh's
  life sobbed out of him as he wrenched at the knife that was into him almost
  hilt-deep.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu's voice came out of shadow. "So then, are they both dead? That means
  Dur-i-Duran Singh is out of it as well as Zaman Ali. Taron Ling next! Where
  is he?"</p>

  <p>The blackjack, blood-hideous, had fallen between Blair's feet and the
  tunnel wall. He kicked it into a deep crack in the floor. Then he set his
  foot on Grish Singh's body and pulled out the long knife; he sent that after
  the blackjack, out of further harm's way. Wu Tu watched him; he could hardly
  see more than her eyes and a faint film of light on one bare shoulder. The
  Chinese girl was invisible.</p>

  <p>"Come here and drop your dagger down that hole," he commanded.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu laughed tartly. "Oh, yes! For the use, I suppose, of the other two
  who ran away! They will come back. They won't care to meet Taron Ling in the
  tunnel! They will need water, too. Don't be foolish. You have only one
  bullet. There was a quarrel and Zaman Ali used the others. You can't shoot
  more than one of us. And if you shoot me, then what?"</p>

  <p>"Come out of that shadow," he answered. She obeyed, but the Chinese girl
  remained invisible. Standing again beside Zaman Ali's body, Wu Tu showed no
  fear, but excitement made her weirdly beautiful. She let one loose sari fall,
  and she was naked enough then for her body to gleam like old ivory&mdash;a
  carving done by a magician's hand&mdash;motion and sensuous intelligence
  revealed in pure line and balanced curve.</p>

  <p>"I will speak to you, Blair."</p>

  <p>"Where is Henrietta Frensham?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Rot! You or Zaman Ali, or some of your party decoyed her to this place.
  Zaman Ali admitted it to me. Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Zaman Ali hid her. Perhaps," she added, speaking slowly, "she
  needs water! You need more than water. You need me, if you will break the
  influence of Taron Ling! Where is he?"</p>

  <p>She stepped toward him. The Chinese girl came out of a shadow and calmly
  gathered up the fallen sari. Blair made a mental note of the probability that
  the hidden dagger had changed owners. Standing within six feet of him, like a
  slave for sale, Wu Tu delivered an ultimatum:</p>

  <p>"Blair, be as honest as I am! You don't want me, but you need me. I don't
  want you, but I need you! By the naked truth, I swear to be your friend. But
  you must swear by your honor to be my friend! You are a savage. Swear then by
  your honor and I will believe you! I will give you Henrietta Frensham&mdash;I
  will give her to you. She shall be yours. I am not a savage. I am cultured,
  so to me there is no such foolishness as honor. But I need you, and you need
  me, and that is naked truth, so r swear by that."</p>

  <p>"Where's Henrietta Frensham?" he repeated. She shrugged her shoulders,
  smiled, narrowing her eyes. She spoke slowly. "Taron Ling will be the one of
  whom to ask that, if you and I don't agree! He shall have her. Only you and I
  together can prevent that. And on my terms! As for you, you will die. As for
  me&mdash;I gamble. What I seek is worth the gamble." She came closer to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Keep your distance!"</p>

  <p>She obeyed. "Blair, see what I will show you. After that, answer."</p>

  <p>"I'll look. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Let me pass you."</p>

  <p>He stepped back to the wall. The Chinese girl came carrying the sari and
  the two women walked past him toward the fierce light at the end of the
  tunnel, speaking Chinese to each other. The Chinese girl stooped and picked
  up the hilt of her broken dagger that Blair had crushed underfoot.</p>

  <p>"Drop that!" he commanded. She looked at him over her shoulder as if he
  were too contemptible to deserve an answer. He was not sure she was not
  right. He funked the prospect of a fight with two women. He wondered whether
  funk, emotion, lack of sleep and thirst were combining to make him
  incompetent. He had found out practically nothing. He was more mystified now
  than ever.</p>

  <p>He decided to follow them, chiefly because he was thirsty. He needed a
  drink like the devil. The few drops of water he had had were only a little
  better than nothing; they had made him crave more. There was maddening
  irritation in the dust that every footstep stirred. Wu Tu probably needed
  drink, too, and almost certainly knew where to get it. He was sweating and
  grimy; he kept imagining pools of cool water in which to plunge, drink, bathe
  himself. He could not imagine Wu Tu remaining personally dirty a moment
  longer than she could help. She was probably heading for water now&mdash;lots
  of it. He quickened his pace. But what he saw, a moment later, almost drove
  the thought of water from his mind.</p>

  <p>The tunnel opened on a ledge that passed completely around the sheer wall
  of an almost oval chasm. Its sides glittered with quartz and micah. It was
  shaped like a womb&mdash;a retort. It narrowed upward to a curving neck,
  through which daylight poured like molten, white-hot metal; the light turned
  golden as it picked up color from the quartz on the flanks of the place.</p>

  <p>The ledge on which he found himself was about a hundred feet above 'a
  floor that seemed covered with stuff like wax from a guttered, candle, but
  the stuff glittered so that he could hardly see it. In the midst of that
  floor was a rock shaped roughly like an upturned bowl. Down toward that, from
  the curving roof, hung stalactites like icicles. Those were creamy, not
  dazzling white. Eyes rested on them with relief. The longest of them&mdash;it
  seemed to be forty or fifty feet long&mdash;pointed directly downward at an
  object that looked like crystal or flaming opal. It flashed so that eyesight
  refused to define it.</p>

  <p>From the mouth of the tunnel where he stood staring, to the smooth wall on
  the far side, the pit was not less than three hundred feet across. Its size
  dwarfed that glittering thing in the midst, but the thing monopolized
  attention. Eyes, that could not see it beneath puckered eyelids, hardly could
  be forced to look away from it. It was not clear crystal; at moments it
  looked like frosted glass or a colossal uncut diamond. A bird flew overhead
  and was reflected in it. Gradually something else appeared, apparently inside
  the thing&mdash;something that took human shape. It looked as if a human body
  was encased in a cone of glass or ice. But it was too big to be a human body.
  When Blair moved it vanished.</p>

  <p>There were a few birds up near the neck where the sunlight streamed in.
  There was such silence that their wing-beats were audible. It was a kind of
  cathedral silence, punctuated by another delicious sound, of dripping water.
  But there was no water anywhere to be seen. The stalactites were bone-dry;
  the water that oozed from the rock to create them had dried up centuries
  ago.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu was sitting on the brink of the ledge, to the right, in comparative
  shadow. She was staring at that central object. The Chinese girl, beside her,
  stood holding Wu Tu's sari over one arm and doing something to the broken
  dagger-handle. It was easy to keep them in full view. There appeared to be no
  way out except up that unclimbable curve toward daylight or else back through
  the tunnel. Blair turned left, away from them, in full sunlight, shading his
  eyes under his left hand, stopping at every third or fourth step to stare at
  that glittering central cone. But it was no use. That was. all he could see;
  it was cone-shaped, and even that discovery made his eyes ache. It seemed to
  gather all the rays of light into itself and then reflect them again outward.
  It would have been easier to stare at a sunlit mirror. There were momentary
  glimpses of the thing within; then eyes swam, tortured by the brilliance.</p>

  <p>He doubted the glimpses&mdash;thought they were imaginary, or the
  reflections of some other object. But there was no other object that could
  have caused them. He had to cover his eyes at last;, he was so blinded by the
  glare that he could hardly see Wu Tu any longer. But he just could see her,
  so he walked back around the ledge toward her, keeping close to the wall for
  fear his eyes might play tricks; and when he reached the tunnel he stared
  straight into it, resting his eyes On the weird gloom. Something moved
  against the dim light at the far end. Wu Tu was right: the two men who had
  fled toward the other tunnel had returned. They were making no noise. He
  could not detect a sound, although he listened for nearly a minute.</p>

  <p>When he approached Wu Tu the Chinese girl walked away and stood with her
  back to the wall of the chasm. He passed between them and stood beyond them,
  where he could watch them both and keep an eye, too, on the mouth of the
  tunnel, where two men might appear at any moment.</p>

  <p>"Where are we?" he demanded, pointing upward with the revolver. "Where's
  that opening?"</p>

  <p>Wu Tu shrugged her shoulders. "Gaglajung. There is a sheer cliff on this
  side of the summit; and there is a great crack in a fold of the cliff, but it
  can't be seen from above or below."</p>

  <p>"Where's the way out?"</p>

  <p>"The way you came in."</p>

  <p>"There's another. Where is it?"</p>

  <p>"Taron Ling knows."</p>

  <p>"You don't?"</p>

  <p>"No, and I don't care. It doesn't matter. Win or lose all. Look."</p>

  <p>He was watching the Chinese girl. She had filled one dagger with the
  little liquid that remained in the broken handle she had picked up. She
  screwed the dagger-handle tight and tossed the broken one over the ledge. His
  eyes followed it. It was only then that he saw clearly what he had hurt his
  eyes trying to see from other angles. The ledge where Wu Tu sat was broken.
  Carved stone-work, once erected there, had fallen and lay in ruins a hundred
  feet below. Directly opposite, within that cone-shaped thing that shone
  beneath the pointing stalactite, there stood&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The ancient secret of the Caves of Gaglajung!" said Wu Tu. "Do you
  understand it?"</p>

  <p>The thing was staggering. It was not a statue: that was evident at the
  first glance. It had no quality of sculpture, but an awful weirdness. Like Wu
  Tu in her own surroundings, it stirred in Blair an instantaneous and exciting
  impulse. He craved to interpret that thing unevasively, then, that moment,
  and to set down his opinion savagely in line and color. It challenged him. He
  was no longer, at that moment, a policeman, but an artist.</p>

  <p>Thirst became unimportant. Danger dismissed itself from consciousness.
  There remained one emotion&mdash;awe; one impulse, to create. Within that
  conical, smooth, crystalline formation stood a woman. She could be seen
  perfectly from where Wu Tu was seated. and from where Blair stood, exactly
  behind her. If he moved six feet to the right or left he could see nothing
  but dazzling stabs of light amid an opalescent cone.</p>

  <p>The woman was not less than nine feet tall. She stood erect in an attitude
  of mystic contemplation. She had been turned to stone within the stalagmitic
  ooze that once dripped from the rocks of the vaulted roof. But the appearance
  of life still remained, with all its color. She had light brown hair and she
  was broad shouldered, with large feet and hands, and was muscled like an
  athlete. Her legs looked capable of climbing mountains. Her skin was more
  butter- than ivory-color. It was definitely not a statue. That woman had once
  lived, moved, had her being.</p>

  <p>She appeared even to breathe as the sun passed higher than the slot-like
  opening in the cavern roof and the changing light touched flaws and wave-like
  irregularities on the surface of the stuff that enclosed her. At one instant
  it resembled mother-of-pearl&mdash;then opal&mdash;then clear glass. Gold and
  silver flame with red sparks appeared to leap and die away within, until the
  bright hair stole all the sunlight for a moment and the entire cone became
  pale sapphire that changed to amethyst and then flashed white again.</p>

  <p>"Strength!" said Wu Tu with her head between her hands. Her voice was
  startling. It awoke hollow echoes. "Do you see how strong she was? Such as
  she could crack rocks&mdash;by thinking!"</p>

  <p>Blair looked down at her. That might be a new line on Wu Tu. Was that her
  secret? Glutted with the loot of criminal intrigue and influence, was she
  seeking a more occult strength and new fields for its use? Typically
  oriental, that. Hundreds of thousands of orientals have abandoned material
  means in the quest for spiritual causes. But it calls for a different
  character than Wu Tu possessed&mdash; a different integrity. She looked
  bizarre, dwarfed, pretty and so feeble in comparison to the gigantic grandeur
  at which she stared, that Blair almost laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>The human habit of explaining everything at once assured him he was face
  to face with something older than Egypt&mdash;than history&mdash;older,
  perhaps, than legend. It filled him with awe and excitement. It revealed the
  essential littleness of Wu Tu. But intuition warned him not to. let her know
  he had seen that. He could feel his own littleness. In the presence of such
  fabulous antiquity he felt of no importance&mdash;an impertinence&mdash;a
  mere policeman&mdash; ignorant. But he hungered to draw and paint what he
  saw.</p>

  <p>Henrietta? Was this her secret, that she had said she could tell to a
  lover perhaps, but not to a policeman? Was Henrietta yearning too, to "crack
  rocks"&mdash;to steal some prehistoric scientific truth, of which this
  giantess within the stalagmite perhaps had been the sibyl? Did that account
  for Frensham's disappearance? Did it account for Taron Ling? Zaman Ali?
  Dur-i-Duran Singh of Naga Kulu? The golden box in the commissioner's office?
  Was there a discoverable secret? Or were they all mad? Within the transparent
  cone, glowing golden now, the monstrous woman smiled like an image of Kali,
  bride of the Destroyer&mdash;pondered like Rodin's Thinker. What had she
  known, that marked her with so much dignity?</p>

  <p>"Who built Gizeh, the Great Pyramid?" asked Wu Tu suddenly in a low,
  throaty voice that filled the cavern full of murmurs. "Who built Stonehenge
  and the temples of Peru? There were giants on the earth in those days
  &mdash;giants and magicians. They knew, but we don't know. What if we did
  know? Anyone who did know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Blair interrupted. "Where's that water that I hear dripping?"</p>

  <p>He had not noticed where the Chinese girl went. He had almost forgotten
  her. She came now along the ledge toward him, carrying water in a golden bowl
  that had the same smooth character and color as the ornament he had seen on
  Wu Tu's table in Bombay.</p>

  <p>The sudden memory made him stare again at the woman within the cone. There
  was a resemblance. Her features were less sphinx-like, more human, but
  vaguely like those on that figurine. He had drawn it in the train, from
  memory&mdash;had made forty or fifty efforts to catch with his pencil the
  strangely subhuman quality. Perhaps he had failed because he had thought it
  subhuman. Perhaps it was something else. Anyhow, he remembered it; it was
  much easier to remember than to set down in black and white.</p>

  <p>The Chinese girl gave him the bowl. It was large and heavy; he had to take
  it in both hands, so he held the revolver between his knees. Then he stood at
  the brink of the ledge and, conscious that both women watched him although
  they pretended not to, raised the bowl to the level of his lips and poured
  the contents to the floor a hundred feet below.</p>

  <p>"Hail&mdash;and libation and obeisance to whatever gods there be!" he
  shouted. Then he gave the bowl back. Echoes picked up his words and
  cannonaded them until they died in a whisper&mdash;"There be&mdash;there be!"
  He glanced at Wu Tu: "Damn you, not poison! I said water!"</p>

  <p>"Water! Water!" said the echoes.</p>

  <p>For a moment he thought the Chinese girl would try to push him off the
  ledge, but she had a less murderous motive. He was in time to prevent her
  snatching the revolver. Her hand went to the opening of her jacket then and
  he glimpsed the dagger-handle. But Wu Tu spoke to her in Chinese and she
  turned away, shaking the last drops of water out of the bowl with an air of
  calm indifference. Apparently quite unconcerned, she began to descend the
  sheer flank of the cavern. There seemed to be steps on the far side of a
  projection of the ledge about thirty feet from where Blair was standing. When
  her chin was level with the ledge she turned and waited, watching for a
  signal.</p>

  <p>"You shall have champagne," said Wu Tu.</p>

  <p>"Water. Where is it?"</p>

  <p>Wu Tu got up in silence and signed to him to follow the Chinese girl,
  whose head promptly disappeared below the ledge. Blair ignored that
  invitation. Those two men in the tunnel undoubtedly had heard the echoes.
  They were very likely lurking near the tunnel entrance. They might be in Wu
  Tu's confidence, although they had probably been Zaman Ali's dependents;
  Zaman Ali was notorious for having cutthroats on his payroll. Having lost
  their master they were probably willing to murder anyone, to betray or work
  for anyone&mdash;or all three. They were rats in a trap, dangerous
  opportunists. Wu Tu probably wished to have word with them. Blair took a
  stride along the ledge toward the tunnel.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Wu Tu.</p>

  <p>"Come, come, come!" said the echoes.</p>

  <p>She began to lead toward the steps, but Blair ignored her and went to the
  tunnel entrance. He heard someone with bare feet scampering away ahead of
  him. but when he peered along the tunnel there was no one visible. Wu Tu
  beckoned. He followed her, then, to the head of the steps and she went down
  them quickly with her face to the wall. But to Blair those steps were not
  more than just negotiable. They were irregularly spaced, some of them less
  than a foot wide, all of them more than eighteen inches deep, and there were
  gaps between. They overhung a hundred feet of air, with glaring rock beneath.
  There was nothing to cling to, not a crack in the smooth surface of the hot,
  hewn wall.</p>

  <p>He dreaded unfenced heights and precipices. He stared at the cone and
  retraced his steps until he could clearly see the face of the woman inside
  it. Curiosity then became stronger than dread of the dangerous stairway.
  There must be some way of getting closer to that mystery. He followed Wu Tu.
  She was out of sight already and he was glad she would not see him groping
  his way with his heart in his teeth.</p>

  <p>The eighth or ninth step was a big one. It projected nearly three feet and
  he rested there a moment, leaning his back against the wall and staring at
  the cone. From that angle he could only see the woman's face, magnified and
  distorted by a wave on the cone's surface. Her eyelids seemed to move when he
  moved. Fierce lips seemed to mumble unimaginable things. The ridge of her
  nose grew cynical and eaglish, cruel. Then, at the next step downward her
  head looked too small to be human, but the body bulged like a fat gorilla's.
  Lower again, she looked like someone swimming in reddish water amid deep-blue
  seaweed.</p>

  <p>After that there was a gap. A step was missing. There was a yard of
  glaring air to cross, to a square foot of step on the far side &mdash;not
  much&mdash;nothing to a man in good condition&mdash; hardly more than a
  stride. Wu Tu and the Chinese girl had done it. But Blair's head reeled. It
  was a stride so ghastly, on smooth stone in slippery boots, that he had to
  shut his eyes for sixty seconds before he could force himself to look, and
  make the effort. On the step below, his boot soils slipped, perhaps an inch
  that made his hair rise and his backbone tighten like a racked rope.</p>

  <p>When he recovered balance, his knees trembled and felt so unsteady that he
  had to kneel, then sprawl on two steps. After about a minute he looked
  downward to test his nerve. At the bottom, seventy or eighty feet below, in
  the shadow of the wall, very close to the edge of the glare, he saw a man's
  corpse that appeared to move in spasms.</p>

  <p>It was nearly a minute before he could see that the body lay still and was
  being torn by vultures. Two of the filthy brutes had scented carrion even in
  that pit. While he watched, a third one circled downward from the opening,
  around and around the cone, its shadow splurging black on the crystal and
  its. wings disturbing silence with a noise like wind in a forest. Two more of
  the death-watch from the broken fangs of Gaglajung followed, and cast their
  shadows on the cone. With his head on the step, Blair thought the woman in
  the cone suggested then, from that angle, a figure of Despair, frozen in
  self-contemplation.</p>

  <p>He crawled after that on hands and knees, hugging the wall as he groped
  his way downward one step at a time, until he reached a smooth, projecting
  stone about six feet wide that formed the threshold of an opening in the
  wall. But the opening was only half the width of the stone slab. It was
  smooth-hewn, shaped like an elongated horse-collar, with the narrowed part at
  the bottom. Wu Tu stood in the opening with her back to a passage that grew
  dim ten feet behind her.</p>

  <p>"Now you look less like a strong savage!" she observed with a mean smile
  that made her look ten years older.</p>

  <p>Blair thought of having to reclimb those steps. The thought sickened him.
  But it felt good to be standing on wide stone. It was good enough for the
  moment. Anger returned to his aid, along with primitive emotions that
  included a desire to kill Wu Tu and hurl her below to the vultures. She was
  watching his eyes and choosing words. She chose with peculiar skill, if she
  meant to enrage him further:</p>

  <p>"In uniform, Blair, with all the greatness of the government's authority,
  you're one thing. But now you're naked&mdash;and there's, no government! How
  does it feel to be mere Blair Warrender without a friend or a servant? Why
  not blow your whistle?"</p>

  <p>It was true, he did feel naked. Not nude, naked. His torn, soiled uniform
  had lost the quality which cloaks bewilderment beneath assumed official calm.
  He had lost self-assurance. He was nakedly scared. But the truth is a
  two-edged weapon. It stiffens some men, though it weakens others. He began to
  try to ride fear&mdash;to command it, compel it, change it into alertness. Wu
  Tu detected a change in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Look." She pointed. He turned. There was no room to stand beside her in
  the opening so he leaned against the curiously carved edge and stared again
  at the wonderful cone, with the sweat running out of his sleeve on to the
  revolver in his right hand. Seen from that point the cone took a different
  shape. It was crystal-clear, faintly golden colored, with ruby-red and
  emerald and sapphire points of sunlight dancing to the beat of the observer's
  pulse.</p>

  <p>The woman within the cone appeared to stand exactly on the level of that
  opening in the rock-wall. She faced exactly toward it&mdash;gazed straight
  into it. Her eyes seemed alive and deep blue. Human, huge, incredible,
  unlovely, splendid, ponderous but not coarse, clothed in mystery that numbed
  imagination, she imposed a silence that was silvered by the echo of running
  water. Even thought obeyed her. Millions of years of living silence brooded
  in the dead, who had once lived, who had perhaps loved.</p>

  <p>"Come and drink champagne," said Wu Tu suddenly. "I can't bear it. She
  makes me solemn. When I'm that way I want to smash things. That's why vandals
  break old monuments. They can't endure them. I'm a vandal in spite of myself.
  If I had some dynamite I would blow her to hell."</p>

  <p>She led the way into the tunnel&mdash;sharply
  up-hill&mdash;stifling&mdash;barely head-room. Blair pulled off his tunic.
  The sound of splashing water, that had emphasized the silence of the cavern,
  grew louder and made thirst almost maddening. There were hundreds of bats
  squeaking and swarming in dark fissures in the sides of the tunnel; the
  sloping floor had very recently been swept clean of their excreta, but its
  stench was in the hot air. The tunnel was shaped strangely.</p>

  <p>It rose sharply from the entrance. Down the midst. the floor was worn in a
  hollow trough that forced him to walk carefully; it resembled hollows he had
  seen that he knew had been made by bare feet century after century.</p>

  <p>At last a platform, pitch-dark, with a sensation, of an opening in the
  darkness beyond&mdash; perhaps, another tunnel. But on the left hand there
  was a low square opening; and light beyond it. Wu Tu ducked and passed
  through. The, sound of water splashed like music on his ears, so Blair
  followed, holding the revolver in front of him. He had to bend almost, double
  to avoid the low roof. It felt like, crawling into a nest of specters. Three
  candle-flames in red-glazed lanterns cast a blood-red glow and leaping
  shadows on the walls of a room, apparently a perfect cube of twenty-eight or
  thirty feet, hewn from the rock.</p>

  <p>All around, except at the low opening, was a ledge about eighteen inches
  high and two feet, deep, forming a shelf on which golden-looking objects
  stood. In one far corner was a big stone cistern like the one in the Great
  Pyramid of Gizeh. Above that was a gash in the wall, through which water,
  beautifully colored by the candlelight, poured into the cistern, overflowing
  through a deep slot in the brim to a hole in the floor, where it vanished.
  The Chinese girl was kneeling on the floor beside three hampers of
  provisions.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu, with her face blood-red in the lantern-light, pointed to Blair's
  revolver. "One shot left! Save it for Taron Ling! The fool who had Zaman
  Ali's extra cartridges lies below, where he can't be reached. Zaman Ali shot
  four fools. He would have shot those others, they had served their purpose
  and weren't to be trusted; but he had to husband ammunition after the fool he
  thought he could trust fell from the steps and smashed himself. It doesn't
  pay to trust fools&mdash;ever."</p>

  <p>Under cover of his tunic Blair opened the revolver, removed the one unused
  cartridge and put that in his pocket. Wu Tu started at the noise of the
  breech snapping shut, but she could not see what he had done.</p>

  <p>"The safety catch?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>"Yes." He strode toward the water, laid, his folded tunic on the ledge
  beside a golden-looking vessel, stuck the revolver into a crack in the wall,
  put his helmet on top of the tunic &mdash;all neatly and slowly to prove to
  himself that he was in no haste. Then, suddenly, he plunged his head info the
  cistern and let the descending water splash on the back of his neck. That was
  heaven, if a contrast of experience is heaven or hell, as some say.</p>

  <p>He drank very little but rinsed his mouth and throat. Then he raised his
  head, and pulled off his shirt. The girl on the floor beside the hampers
  cursed in Chinese because he had splashed her, but Wu Tu laughed and came
  beside him. In a moment she had dropped her sari and jumped into the cistern,
  ducking her head under, plunging and revelling in the cool, clean water.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Blair, in with you!" she gasped. He had a mind to go in boots
  and all but thought better of that, and took them off. In a moment he was in
  there with her, slipping against the slimy sides and, digging hot toes into
  the cool, soft sediment of centuries that lay inches deep on the bottom.</p>

  <p>"Chamber of initiation&mdash;font of baptism!" said Wu Tu, spluttering and
  laughing. "She got into this, I bet you! Could she get in? Was she too big?
  Have some champagne, it tastes good in a bath!"</p>

  <p>Blair glanced at the Chinese girl. Her back toward him, she was emptying
  one of the hampers, on the floor, almost straight between him and the low,
  dark entrance. It was velvet-dark there&mdash;a black square blot on a wall
  stained dark-red by the lantern-light. But something in the blackness moved.
  His eye: caught it. He watched. A man's face, spectral, almost darker than
  the darkness, gradually took form.</p>

  <p>For a moment he thought it was Taron Ling returned to life and his skin
  crept up his: spine, but he knew that was nonsense. He decided it must be
  one. of the men they had left behind in the other tunnel, so he looked for
  the revolver in the crack in the wall. It had vanished. But the man's face
  was still there, very low, near the edge of the dark, in the mouth of the
  low, square opening.</p>

  <p>He leaped suddenly out of the cistern, with the red light like blood on
  his wet skin, and sent the Chinese girl sprawling. He grabbed the revolver
  from the hamper, where she had half-hidden it under napkins. He had no
  cartridge now; it was in his pocket.</p>

  <p>He knew he was a perfect target in the lantern-light&mdash;knew, too, that
  the Chinese girl and Wu Tu were behind him and not likely to neglect an
  opportunity. So he was quick. He reached the opening in three leaps&mdash;
  stooped&mdash;stared, and froze motionless. There was a finger on the face's
  lips. There was a signal&mdash;a very low whisper. Chetusingh, haggard,
  wild-eyed. and corpse-like, but unmistakably Chetusingh, crawled backward
  until he became one with the darkness and vanished.</p>

  <p>"Taron Ling?" demanded Wu Tu from the cistern.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered. "Nerves. I thought I saw him.".</p>

  <p>"Why did you whisper then? I heard you."</p>

  <p>"If you want to know," he said, "I was praying. I'm chattering
  nervous."</p>

  <p>She climbed out. "Have some champagne."</p>

  <p>Red light glowed all over her.</p>

  <p>"You look like a devil in hell!" he said laughing. The laugh sounded
  nervous and seemed to convince her. He made a show of recovering
  self-control&mdash;pulled out serviettes from the hamper&mdash;tossed her
  several of them &mdash;rubbed himself dry with two others, and put his
  sweat-wet tunic on again. Even that disgusting anticlimax could not lower his
  spirits now. Chetusingh had told him Henrietta was not in immediate danger.
  He had time for what the commissioner called "facts, not fireworks." He
  dressed swiftly and reloaded the revolver.</p>

  <p>There was a sudden pop, then, like a cannon going off. The Chinese girl
  poured champagne into a big cut-glass tumbler. Wu Tu gulped half of it down.
  That at any rate was not poisoned. Blair took the tumbler from her hand and
  drank the other half. It was warm, but good dry wine; it found his nerves and
  seemed to pour along them.</p>

  <p>"What next?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Food," said Wu Tu, who was wrapping her sari around her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"

  <p class="quote">Good? Bad? Those are relative. I have not seen one without
  the other; they are two sides of the same thing, and the thing is integrity,
  which has no opposite. Treachery may have integrity and may do good, as when
  a traitor betrays a devil. Integrity may ruin thousands, as when nations go
  to war for a principle, which may be right or wrong. The wrong may have the
  more integrity! Integrity is a thing in itself. It is a middle way between
  good and evil. It serves best him who has it, but he has it not unless he use
  it. And he has it not if he should try to use it for a momentary profit.
  Good? Bad? Neither of those affects the balance of the Infinite. But
  Integrity? That is the length, breadth, depth, weight, essence and proof of
  Character, which is Quality. And Quality is the goal of evolution. Aim ye at
  that, and ye aim at eternal life.</p>

  <p class="quote">&mdash;From the Ninth (unfinished) Book of Noor Ali.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE food was warm, unappetizing tinned stuff, hard-boiled
  eggs, fruit, and some leathery looking chupatties. Eggs and fruit might have
  been drugged. That was even probable. Wu Tu tried to force them on him, so
  Blair chose a tin of sardines, which he could open for himself; they were
  unappetizing without bread, but the chupatties were a too obvious trick. He
  refused more champagne; there had been time for the Chinese girl to doctor
  what remained in the bottle. Wu Tu drank none and she did not order a second
  bottle to be opened. She ate seated on one of the hampers, looking like the
  devil in the red light, with her hair wet and the Chinese girl trying to
  rearrange it.</p>

  <p>Blair walked up and down examining the golden objects on the low hewn
  shelf. He was in no hurry now&mdash;none whatever. Impatience might slam the
  door on a secret that seemed on the verge of revealing itself. The next move
  should be Chetusingh's. But Wu Tu might have a card up her sleeve, and the
  thing to do was to discover that, if possible without letting her suspect its
  discovery. She was talkative, attempting to conceal excitement, and a bit too
  evidently eager to feel her way toward an exchange of confidences.</p>

  <p>"Guess the value of that gold, Blair. It is gold. Every bit of it's gold.
  But it's hard. It can't even be marked with a hammer."</p>

  <p>"How do you know it's gold?" he demanded. He tapped the barrel of the
  revolver against a molded, massive thing that his utmost strength could not
  move; it was in the form of two big pythons coiled on one another. It sounded
  solid.</p>

  <p>"When it's melted the bullion merchants buy it as gold," she answered.
  "Two or three times' melting takes away its hardness, but the difficulty is
  to get it out of here without people knowing. All the small stuff has gone,
  except that bowl that we use to carry water. Why did you spill the water? Did
  you think I'd poison you? I need you."</p>

  <p>"Who took all the small stuff?"</p>

  <p>"Zaman Ali. There were eighteen gold blocks and fifty figurines; he melted
  all but two gold blocks that General Frensham took, and one figurine that I
  have. I believe you saw it."</p>

  <p>"How do you know Frensham took them?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know lots of things. One of the two that he took found its way into
  the police commissioner's hands in Bombay. Taron Ling tried to get it. His
  magic wouldn't work because the commissioner hasn't the right sort of
  imagination. Two of Zaman Ali's men recovered the other block from Frensham's
  suitcase at the time when he disappeared. Zaman Ali shot those thieves last
  night. They swore it had been stolen from them and he knew that was a lie,
  but he was so afraid of magic that he couldn't wait for Taron Ling to make
  them tell where they'd hidden it. Now I suppose it's lost forever."</p>

  <p>To get her to talk, and to gain time was Blair's immediate problem. If he
  appeared not particularly interested, she might reveal more in an effort to
  get his attention. So he took one of the red-glazed lanterns and examined the
  golden objects on the hewn shelf. To become competent in his profession he
  had had to make himself familiar with Indian religions, but these things
  reminded him of no religion he had ever studied.</p>

  <p>There were forty-nine pieces. They might be idols or religious symbols.
  They excited imagination. But except for that one example of coiled serpents,
  they suggested nothing he had ever seen and no answer to the riddle they
  presented. They were not Hindu. They were not Buddhistic. They were as
  weirdly-shaped as the most fantastic designs of a Futurist sculptor in
  rebellion against three-dimensional limitations. They had a motive;, that
  much was obvious. They had rhythm. But neither rhythm nor motive was
  intelligible.</p>

  <p>"How long have you known of this place?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Two years." Wu Tu was watching him intently, but he behaved as if unaware
  of that. Her attitude and expression were lynx-like. She appeared to be
  judging his mood and her chance. She went on, "Frensham knew about it
  first&mdash;I don't know how. long ago. He was only a,major when he met that
  Bat-Brahmin who calls himself the Guardian of Gaglajung. Somehow he persuaded
  the Bat to talk. Most Bats are drunkards. Probably he gave him whisky. That
  Bat is a superstitious fool who only knows the legend. He has never dared to
  enter the caverns. He has never been into the tunnel. Generations of
  Bat-Brahmins have known of this place without ever daring, to enter it.</p>

  <p>"The hermit guided Frensham in&mdash;and went mad. Did you see him?
  Frensham took two of the blocks, which was all he could carry. He meant to
  return for the others, but the Bat-Brahmin threatened to have him broke out
  of the army for sacrilege. That was no joke either. He could have done it.
  Frensham didn't dare show those blocks to anyone. But I found out about
  them."</p>

  <p>She paused, weighing the effect of her words. Blair decided she needed
  some encouragement. He set the lantern down and walked slowly toward her.</p>

  <p>"You're a wonderful woman," he said with admiration in his voice.</p>

  <p>Her eyes betrayed a hesitating triumph. She was not quite sure of him. But
  she said something in Chinese, and the Chinese girl withdrew to a little
  distance, picking up the lantern he had set down and putting it back beside
  the two others. That produced a shadow into which she sidled, Blair almost
  lost sight of her; but with the corner of his eye he could just catch the
  color of her daffodil pyjamas. There was treachery coming.</p>

  <p>"You're a great woman," he repeated. He was standing almost over Wu Tu,
  looking down at her.</p>

  <p>"No, not great yet. I propose to be," she answered. "Will you help me to
  it?"</p>

  <p>"You need my help? Rot!" he retorted. "How about helping me? You said you
  would. You're unbeatable. How do you do it? How did you discover all
  this?"</p>

  <p>The Chinese girl had moved away from the lanterns. She was hovering behind
  him now, and he had to watch Wu Tu's eyes. The water pouring into and out of
  the cistern filled the place with sound; his ears had grown accustomed to it,
  but he had to depend on his ears and listen to Wu Tu at the same time,
  without betraying his alertness.</p>

  <p>"Frensham's wife died eighteen years ago," said Wu Tu.</p>

  <p>"Well? What of it?"</p>

  <p>"Men need women."</p>

  <p>"I get you."</p>

  <p>"Frensham is a learned simpleton," she went on. "He was learned and
  intelligent enough to know he had stumbled on a priceless secret if he could
  only interpret it. He was too reverent to play the vandal, and too afraid for
  his own reputation to admit he had trespassed into a forbidden sanctuary. But
  he was jealous, too. He didn't want to share the secret with
  anyone&mdash;jealous and simple-minded. He wanted somebody to open those
  blocks without injuring the contents. They're hollow and he suspected they
  contain tablets or something like that, with some kind of writing on them.
  Why he trusted Dur-i-Duran Singh of Naga Kulu I can't tell you; I would
  sooner trust a cobra. But I think Dur-i-Duran Singh had done him some
  financial favors. Unbusinesslike people such as Frensham are easily
  psychologised in that way.</p>

  <p>"He asked Dur-i-Duran Singh to find him an expert metallurgist who could
  be trusted to keep secrets. Dur-i-Duran Singh consulted me. I got a clever
  girl to entertain Frensham and find out the secret. Frensham is a fatherly
  old thing, and he liked to talk to her. He didn't say much, but he told her
  enough to make me more than interested."</p>

  <p>"Drunk?" Blair asked.</p>

  <p>"No. Couldn't make him drunk. He's abstemious. Besides, some men don't
  talk when they're drunk. That isn't the best way."</p>

  <p>Blair changed position until through the side of his eye he could see the
  Chinese girl standing ten feet away from him quite still; she appeared to be
  interested in the red light on the running water. Wu Tu continued:</p>

  <p>"It was then that Zaman Ali came in, because I needed someone capable of
  tracing Frensham's movements backward to all the places he had visited on
  leave or in the course of duty. Zaman Ali was a greedy thief and a bully, but
  there was no one better for the purpose. He back-tracked Frensham to
  Gaglajung.</p>

  <p>"With a nose for loot like Zaman Ali's it wasn't long before he suspected
  the Bat-Brahmin and guessed where to look. But the Bat-Brahmin proved
  difficult&mdash;denied everything&mdash; threatened to raise a riot and bring
  police on the scene if Zaman Ali dared to trespass. Bribery didn't work. So I
  consulted Dur-i-Duran Singh again, and he sent Taron Ling. Magic terrified
  the Bat. Taron Ling made him see elementals and hear voices. Then he
  hypnotised the hermit. But even Taron Ling couldn't get into the caverns. It
  was I who did that."</p>

  <p>Blair felt a prick on the back of his right hand. He bit and sucked it
  instantly. His left hand&mdash;his eyes were watching Wu Tu's and he had seen
  her signal&mdash;moved with the speed of a knock-out punch and seized the
  Chinese girl's right wrist, twisting, twisting. He did not dare to take his
  eyes off Wu Tu. He twisted the girl's wrist unmercifully, but she neither
  screamed nor let go the thin-bladed dagger. She writhed like a snake and
  tried to reach Wu Tu, who jumped up and snatched at the weapon. Blair sent Wu
  Tu sprawling. Then he rapped the girl's knuckles with the barrel of the
  revolver until she dropped the dagger. Kicking the dagger along the floor in
  front of him to keep it out of Wu Tu's reach, he picked up the girl then and
  dumped her into the cistern, where he held her head under so long that Wu Tu
  screamed at him:</p>

  <p>"A lakh of rupees! I pay a lakh! Let her up!"</p>

  <p>So he let her go, picked up the dagger and sniffed it after biting and
  sucking the back of his right hand again until it bled freely. Then he
  pointed to the hamper:</p>

  <p>"Go back there and sit down!"</p>

  <p>But the Chinese girl seemed all-important. Wu Tu hurried to the cistern
  and tried to comfort her, helping her out and talking to her rapidly in
  Chinese. The girl took it all quite stoically. When she had coughed water
  from her lungs she slipped away from Wu Tu, ignoring Blair as if he were
  nonexistent, and went and sat on the floor near the lanterns, where she
  continued coughing and retching for several minutes. The tone of Blair's
  voice changed perceptibly:</p>

  <p>"Is the drug in this dagger the stuff that made Frensham talk?" he
  demanded. "What is it? What does it do&mdash;paralyze the will or
  something?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Blair. There's no drug, and that was an accident. You
  startled her. She didn't mean to scratch you."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to scratch you and see if it makes you talk," he answered.
  "Come here."</p>

  <p>"No, Blair! No, no!" She retreated slowly. Her eyes were like a desperate
  animal's, her hands ready to scratch. She was like a cat at bay. "No, no, let
  me talk, Blair&mdash;let me tell you."</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said, "sit there. Go on talking or you'll feel the point
  of this thing. You were saying it was you, not Taron Ling or Zaman Ali, who
  found the way in here. How did you do it?"</p>

  <p>Wu Tu sat down on the hamper; full in the lantern glow. "Blair," she said,
  "I thought you were a fool policeman, but I see you're clever. I will trust
  you. I will tell you everything. What did you do to Taron Ling? You didn't
  kill him? Tell me&mdash;did you?"</p>

  <p>"Wait and see," he answered. "Go on with your story."</p>

  <p>"Let me tell in my own way, Blair. You terrify me&mdash;stand back. You
  promised&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I promised." He stood back from her two paces. As the
  friend I said I'd be, I give you one chance."</p>

  <p>"Are we friends if I tell?"</p>

  <p>"Policemen haven't friends," he answered. "Only enemies, protgs and
  allies. Which are you?"</p>

  <p>"Blair, I said I'd give you Henrietta. I can do it."</p>

  <p>"Where? When?"</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, or you'll regret it! Do you want to kill her?"</p>

  <p>"If a hair of her head's hurt, I'll make you suffer for it," he answered
  grimly.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu was equally grim. "You'll be the death of us all unless you listen
  to me! There is magic in this place! That woman out there inside the crystal
  was the queen or the priestess of a race of giants who emerged long
  ago&mdash; no one knows how long ago&mdash;and died out&mdash;vanished. How?
  Why?</p>

  <p>"Frensham found a tablet in here, but he couldn't read it, so he borrowed
  Taron Ling from Dur-i-Duran Singh of Naga Kulu. Taron Ling can put a person
  into trances. Frensham never let Taron Ling see the tablet. He didn't trust
  him. He knew too much about magic and trances to trust a practitioner. He
  kept the tablet hidden in a box, into which he put his hands through two
  holes. But what he understood in the trance he couldn't remember afterwards;
  it was like trying to remember a dream. So he had Henrietta to watch Taron
  Ling and to write down whatever he might say while in the trance.</p>

  <p>"To make extra sure of Taron Ling, he handcuffed him to the wall at the
  opposite side of the room. It was a very small room, but Taron Ling couldn't
  overhear much. However he managed to steal some of the notes Henrietta made.
  I've read them, but Dur-i-Duran Singh won't part with them. He thinks about
  nothing but money and laughs at magic, but all the same he's superstitious
  and he thinks those notes are&mdash;what was that noise?"</p>

  <p>Blair's ears felt as if they twitched. But he knew, if it were Chetusingh,
  he could count on a definite signal. That sound might have been made to
  attract his attention. "Nothing," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Yes it was!" Wu Tu looked thoroughly scared. "I heard a sound in the
  passage. Is it Taron Ling? If it is&mdash;you have one bullet&mdash;shoot
  him!"</p>

  <p>Blair was listening intently, but he went on talking. "Why?" he answered.
  "To oblige you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! Blair, kill that devil! If you don't, he'll kill me. There, I heard
  him again. Kill him, did you hear me! I tell you, kill him!"</p>

  <p>"What's your hurry?" The strange thing was that the Chinese girl seemed
  undisturbed. She had taken off most of her clothes and was wringing them dry.
  Between the red light and the shadows, against a background of unexplainable
  golden moldings and a dark wall, she looked like old ivory&mdash;a
  master-carving, done by a man who knew what motion is and how to suggest it.
  Wu Tu made a sudden grab at the revolver&mdash;missed it&mdash;tried to
  snatch the dagger, and then knelt. She seized Blair's knees. She was almost
  sobbing. Her voice was tragic:</p>

  <p>"Blair, do what I say or we're all damned! If you don't kill Taron Ling,
  he'll kill me and he'll either kill you or use you! What he wants is
  Henrietta. Do you hear me?"</p>

  <p>"And if I kill him?"</p>

  <p>"I will take you then to Henrietta. But I daren't&mdash;I daren't as long
  as Taron Ling is in the taverns!"</p>

  <p>"Silence!" he commanded. Wu Tu clung to him, trembling, holding her
  breath. He felt her fingers dig into the muscles of his leg. The water
  splashed and gurgled in the cistern. The Chinese girl stepped into wrinkled
  trousers and stood, calmly observant, unsmiling, unconcerned apparently;
  making almost no noise with her bare feet, she walked to the cistern and,
  plunging in her arms, groped for her lost cigarette tube.</p>

  <p>She found it almost at once and blew through it to get the water out; it
  made a sharp noise, like a toy trumpet. Then she walked back to the lanterns,
  found her cigarettes there somewhere, picked up a lantern, raised the colored
  glass and lighted her cigarette at the candle. She appeared uncertain where
  to set the lantern down; she moved it to and fro several times before putting
  it back where it was before. To whom could she be signaling? How many more
  than two of Wu Tu's or Zaman Ali's men were in the caverns? Did Wu Tu want
  that one shot actually used, or did she want to see it wasted? Should he tell
  her Taron Ling was dead? He decided not to&mdash;not yet.</p>

  <p>"There's no one there," he said in a distinct, level voice, but he felt
  certain someone lurked in the darkness of the low entrance to the chamber,
  watching, listening. "Why are you afraid of Taron Ling? He's only a
  charlatan. You know as many tricks as he does. You were boasting just now,
  that he couldn't even get in here until you led the way."</p>

  <p>She answered hoarsely, "Blair&mdash;I beg you&mdash; kill him! If I hadn't
  a soul I wouldn't care? I wouldn't be afraid to die&mdash;I'd fear nothing!
  But I have a soul! I wish I hadn't! So have you, and you'll wish you hadn't
  if you don't kill that devil!"</p>

  <p>Softly to himself Blair whistled three bars of a familiar tune that stole
  on memory. He saw no kindly light that led, but&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Soul?" he said. "Have you turned pious?" He was watching the Chinese
  girl's cigarette that moved in quite unnecessary lines and dots as she
  smoked&mdash;took the tube in her fingers&mdash;smoked again. She had the
  damp pyjama jacket in her left hand. There was no real need to shake it; in
  that stifling heat it would have dried in a few minutes. One of the candles
  dropped, forward and blackened the lantern glass. Another guttered and died.
  The remaining one faced Blair and Wu Tu, like a danger signal set in the
  throat of darkness. THE square entrance-hole was now a black blot on the dim
  red darkness of the end wall. Tired eyes strained in the reduced light and
  Blair began to wonder how long he could carry on without sleep. His eyelids
  became suddenly heavy. It was difficult to fix attention simultaneously on Wu
  Tu, the Chinese girl and the entrance-hole. Sensation&mdash;or lack of
  it&mdash;warned him his reserve of nervous energy was perilously near
  exhaustion. But his ears were alert.</p>

  <p>He detected a faint sound that might be a trigger&mdash;or a glass tube
  snapping. He glanced at Wu Tu. In that split second he felt consciousness
  slip from his grasp. He was blinded by an explosion of magnesium light that
  seared the scene into his memory. At the same time there was a sensation of
  being struck, he never knew by what; it was painless, heavy, deadening.</p>

  <p>He hit out blindly. He had dagger and revolver; he used both, not knowing
  what he struck at. Wu Tu clung to his knees. He
  kicked&mdash;swayed&mdash;felt his knees yield. Then, for what seemed endless
  time, he lay still with a roar in his ears, and a vision blazed on his retina
  of three men, of whom one looked like Chetusingh; of Wu Tu and the Chinese
  girl; and he thought the Chinese girl had done something to him, he didn't
  know what. Foreshortened memory was there, too, blended with it all&mdash;the
  giantess within the cone in the sunlit cavern&mdash;the tunnel where Zaman
  Ali and two others lay dead&mdash;the ash-floored sunlit
  charnel-house&mdash;the tunnel beyond it&mdash; Taron Ling, dead and alive at
  the same time&mdash; the shrine, the Bat, the hermit, and Ganesha's image
  inscrutably smiling. The giantess within the sunlit cone changed presently to
  Henrietta; she receded to a vast distance and looked terribly lonely; he felt
  responsible for her loneliness. He knew he loved her, and wished to say
  so.</p>

  <p>In a nightmare, he climbed up and down ghastly steps on the face of a
  precipice, trying to reach her before Wu Tu could prevent him. That effort
  led him gradually back to consciousness, until the roaring in his ears waned
  and changed to human voices. Then mortification and shame swept over him,
  that he should have been caught off-guard. He felt himself' an arrant
  failure.</p>

  <p>The first voice he recognized was Chetusingh's. He could not hear what
  Chetusingh said but the tone of the man's voice conveyed a sensation of
  horror. He was not speaking English. He addressed somebody as Soonia and then
  Jenny, which sounded off-key and incongruous, until he remembered that Soonia
  and Jenny were two of Wu Tu's names. Soon after that he recognized Wu Tu's
  voice, and then full consciousness returned, although he felt incapable of
  movement. He could not even move his eyelids. He lay as if paralyzed by a
  blow that had left his brain functioning.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu&mdash;angry&mdash;excited&mdash;vigorous&mdash;was speaking English.
  Her eyes stared at him out of the dark, through his own closed eyelids. He
  felt a sickening distrust of Chetusingh. Had Wu Tu told the truth? Had
  Chetusingh turned traitor? He kept on speaking Hindustanee in a monotonous
  voice that droned against the splash and gurgle of the water in the cistern.
  He was answering Wu Tu's questions:</p>

  <p>"I obeyed. I have not seen Taron Ling. I brought her here, did I not? I
  lied. She did not believe, but she came with me nevertheless. And I protected
  her from Zaman Ali and his men, who wanted to make her afraid.so that Taron
  Ling might control her more, easily. But I think she can not be controlled,
  unless this man does it. She has not spoken to me since I told her Bee-lair
  Warrender will come soon."</p>

  <p>"Idiot!" That was Wu Tu's voice again. "I ordered you to say I bring him.
  That without me he could not come to her. Why didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"I did. After that she was silent."</p>

  <p>"What else have you done?"</p>

  <p>"As bidden. I summoned these two. Here they are. That they are dead is not
  my doing. There were two of Zaman Ali's men on the ledge lip yonder. They
  came toward us three, very fearful, saying that Zaman Ali lies dead of a
  knife-wound and that two more of his men lie dead beside him.</p>

  <p>"Taron Ling, said they, is somewhere in the tunnel. They invited us three
  to go with them to Taron Ling. They said Taron Ling has put magic on Bee-lair
  Warrender, who will therefore obey Taron Ling whatever comes of it; and
  consequently there is nothing else to do but to take Taron Ling's part and to
  kill you, seeing that you can do nothing with Bee-lair Warrender now that
  Taron Ling is controlling him.</p>

  <p>"They said Dur-i-Duran Singh of Naga Kulu is your enemy, and you his,
  though you pretend friendship. And that Taron Ling is faithful unto death to
  Dur-i-Duran Singh, who will bestow great rewards when he possesses the secret
  of Gaglajung. Whereas, said they, Wu Tu is likelier to kill, as she killed
  Zaman Ali, in order to have all for herself. And they said you will kill her,
  and Bee-lair Warrender also, as soon as you have what you want, because you
  will wish to keep it secret. Taron Ling, said they, will be too clever for
  you; he will kill you. . . . Then there was a quarrel, because your men
  answered hotly.</p>

  <p>"There were blows and the end came swiftly; they two fell into the great
  pit, where vultures were already picking one of Zaman Ali's men. After that,
  we three came hither."</p>

  <p>"Slow! Late!" Wu Tu spoke savagely. But Chetusingh answered like a man in
  a dream, or as if broken by punishment until nothing remained but the will to
  obey.</p>

  <p>"Step by step as bidden&mdash;no haste&mdash;no delay&mdash; no excuse."
  That phrase sounded suspiciously like a formula impressed hypnotically on his
  mind. "I lay there in the dark and made a signal to Bee-lair Warrender, to
  betray him, to gain time while I summoned these two. Could I have done
  better? How should I know he had dagger and pistol? I did not know. I did as
  bidden."</p>

  <p>"Dog!" she retorted. "Two good servants dead, and worse!&mdash;no more
  drug for the dagger! Would to God I had not wasted stuff on you that cost a
  fortune! Who protects us now from Taron Ling? You? Who undoes Taron Ling's
  hold on him? You? Who shall manage Henrietta Frensham? You?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Chetusingh's voice wearily in English.</p>

  <p>"Go!" she commanded. "Find Taron Ling. Kill him!"</p>

  <p>"I have no weapon."</p>

  <p>"Find one, or else kill him with your hands! Don't dare to return to me
  while Taron Ling lives!"</p>

  <p>Blair felt the blood coursing again in his veins, but shame and contempt
  for Chetusingh were his chief sensations. He almost forgot his own
  predicament. Chetusingh had been his discovery&mdash;his comrade-in-arms. He
  felt his eyelids flutter. He got a glimpse of the shadowy chamber, but saw
  very little, closed his eyes again and lay still. It would be better to let
  Chetusingh get out of the way. Then, when he was gone, he would jump up
  suddenly and snatch the lantern; that would give him a slight advantage. He
  listened for the Rajput's footfall and almost disbelieved his ears
  when&mdash;thump and slither on the rock floor&mdash;he recognized a familiar
  spacing of sounds. None but he and Chetusingh knew that code. It was an
  almost similar signal to the one Chetusingh made with bare feet in the
  passage in Wu Tu's house in Bombay. It meant:</p>

  <p>"Am acting independently and can't communicate."</p>

  <p>Did Chetusingh know he was conscious? How did he know? Had he seen the
  momentary flutter of the eyelids? The Rajput's retreating footfall&mdash;he
  was evidently barefooted &mdash;rutched along the floor, paused at the
  opening, hesitated&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Go!" repeated Wu Tu.</p>

  <p>There were sounds as if Chetusingh groped in the dark for something. It
  appeared he found slippers or sandals which he slapped on the floor or the
  wall before putting them on&mdash;habit that&mdash;to get the dust out, or to
  avoid being stung by an insect&mdash;a perfectly natural action, almost
  automatic. Thousands of Indians do it. But the
  slap-slap&mdash;pause&mdash;slap&mdash;pause&mdash;slap-slap was a signal as
  plain as the other had been&mdash;meaningless to anyone but Blair and
  Chetusingh. To them it meant:</p>

  <p>"Give me time for necessary details and await my signal."</p>

  <p>After that he heard Chetusingh scramble clumsily, as if he were dog-tired
  and indifferent, along the ten or twelve feet of the low, square
  entrance-hole. He heard him get to his feet at the far end.j Then he heard
  him drop the little metal box in which he kept materials for preparing pan,
  stuff that he never chewed but never went without because an offer of pan is
  like a proffered cigarette; it serves sometimes to open intimacy with
  strangers.</p>

  <p>He could be heard groping in the dark for the fallen box. He fumbled it.
  Then he opened the box and snapped it shut. That signal meant: "No immediate
  danger."</p>

  <p>Did it? Their code was a system of norma] movements such as any one might
  make in almost any circumstances. The first and second signal might,
  conceivably, have been made by accident. But three signals running seemed
  beyond the pale of coincidence. On the other hand, Chetusingh had told Wu Tu
  he made a signal previously for the purpose of betrayal. Whom was he
  betraying now? Benefit of doubt is doubtful policy when death creeps uncoiled
  in the dark. Wu Tu boasted Chetusingh was her man. Was he? Wu Tu spoke
  suddenly in Chinese and Blair opened his eyes a fraction. He saw the Chinese
  girl, fully dressed now, bend to take up the one remaining lantern and follow
  Chetusingh. She paused at the far end of the low opening, seemed to listen to
  Chetusingh's retreating footsteps, and at last set down the lantern and
  remained beside it. It was safe to open his eyes wide then. It was pitch-dark
  except for one spot of reflected red light dancing on the water that poured
  into the cistern. At the far end of the low entrance was the lantern,
  ruby-red, like a point-light in an underground railway tunnel.</p>

  <p>But he closed his eyes after a moment. Wu Tu lifted his head to her
  lap&mdash;touched something to his nostrils. It had a faint smell, but
  whatever it was she shook it as if it was empty and he heard her set it down.
  After that her fingers caressed his temples and passed over his eyes.
  "Sleep!" she commanded in a low voice. "Sleep! Sleep" He found it difficult
  at first to stay awake. He had been exhausted and sleepy before this
  happened. Lassitude stole over him. The gurgling water harmonized with her
  voice. He could almost physically feel magnetic influence stealing over him
  and he began to see her eyes again through closed eyelids.</p>

  <p>He reminded himself that there is no such influence; that by suggestion
  mesmerists persuade a victim to impose obedience on himself. Nevertheless, he
  felt consciousness slipping. But her eyes, that he saw without seeing,
  aroused anger. He resented them&mdash; rebelled against the impudent trickery
  that compelled him to see them. Had she done something of the sort to
  Henrietta? The thought of Henrietta in Wu Tu's clutches stirred an impulse to
  kill. But the same impulse aroused caution. He must first, have Wu Tu's
  secret&mdash;Henrietta's&mdash;Frensham's. Secrecy is the key to secrets. He
  lay still.</p>

  <p>There was something hard between the back of his hand and his leg. He
  guessed it was the empty revolver. By pressing his hand against that he hurt
  it sharply where the Chinese girl had pricked him and he. had bitten the
  wound to make it bleed. He kept on doing it. The pain intensified alertness.
  By continually relaxing and increasing the pressure he avoided becoming used
  to it.</p>

  <p>"Sleep!" commanded Wu Tu. "Sleep! Sleep! Sleep and forget&mdash;and
  forget." Her hands moved rhythmically caressing his eyes and temples. Some or
  her sensuous perfume still clung to her clothing. Heat, the sensation of
  darkness, the.sound of flowing water aided her. Stab-stab went the pain in
  his right hand. He was awake, alert. But he breathed evenly, relaxing his
  neck-muscles so that his head lay heavy oh her lap. "Forget! Forget!"
  commanded Wu Tu. He remembered every detail of her previous attempt on him in
  Bombay. She pinched his ear but he was ready for it&mdash;lay still. She
  pinched until her nails almost met in the lobe of his ear, but he betrayed no
  sign of having felt it. The voltage of his anger increased with every stab of
  pain, but he welcomed the pain because it proved he was conscious.</p>

  <p>"You are asleep," she said, "but you know. Marie speaks to you. You are
  happy&mdash;oh, so happy, because Marie gives you Henrietta. You desire, and
  you love Henrietta with all your heart."</p>

  <p>The position of his neck across her thigh had become almost intolerable.
  He, moved slightly. She took his head in both hands and re-settled it in her
  lap. "Sleep! Sleep! You are asleep. But you can speak when I tell you to
  speak."</p>

  <p>The terrific difficulty was. to lie slack. If he had allowed alertness to
  make his muscles rigid she would have noticed it. Mesmerism very likely was
  her last card, if it was true that her supply of drug was exhausted. To
  defeat her, he must convince her she was winning. But it is easier to feign
  strength than weakness. He was afraid he might sneeze. Fear created the
  impulse. Not to sneeze, then, was his,height of attainment of self-control.
  He did not sneeze, and the effort of will left him more than ever master of
  himself. He no longer saw Wu Tu's eyes through closed eyelids. His
  imagination functioned normally; he could bring up any mental picture he
  wished; could see himself, for instance, unshaven, in a filthy uniform, on
  his back on the floor of a hewn rock chamber, with his head in the lap of the
  most dangerous woman in India.</p>

  <p>He did not enjoy the danger; but he admired that woman with a patient,
  merciless and deadly admiration that exceeded, by a thousand times, his
  regard for the tiger he, had shot dead the previous night. His admiration
  for. her was her greatest danger. She might spring surprises, but he Would be
  ready.</p>

  <p>"Sleep!" she commanded. "Sleep! You are in a deep sleep. But you can hear
  and you can answer. You think what I tell you to think. You have no other
  thought. It makes you happy&mdash;very happy&mdash;very, very happy to think
  what I tell you. You have no voice except to answer me. You are about to go
  to Henrietta. You love Henrietta. Answer me. Do you love Henrietta?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered, picking a tone of voice at random. It appeared to
  satisfy her.</p>

  <p>"And you trust me, Marie. Answer, do you trust me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Yes,, you trust me. I am Marie, who am more than a lover and more than a
  friend. Blair, Marie&mdash;Marie, Blair&mdash;we two trust and understand
  each other. When you awake you will forget Wu Tu; you will forget Jenny and
  Soonia Singh. You will remember Marie, who is your friend and guide. Answer.
  Whom do you remember?</p>

  <p>"Marie."</p>

  <p>"Marie has wisdom, experience, courage. Marie is the wisest woman in the
  world. Marie knows how rotten all the world is, with intrigues and treachery,
  and she despises it, so you also despise it. Like her, you despise the little
  official cowards with big names and authority. They call Marie Wu Tu, and
  they know she could ruin them, men and women. She knows their secrets. But
  you know why she doesn't ruin them. Marie is great and generous. Great and
  generous. Marie deserves to be great. Answer: what is Marie?"</p>

  <p>"Great," he answered. "Great and generous." He could feel her thrill to
  the answer.</p>

  <p>"Now you will go to Henrietta because Marie sends you. Henrietta loves
  you. You love Henrietta. But she is in danger because she has stolen the
  secret of the Woman of Gaglajung. She is in deadly danger. You will go to
  Henrietta. You will love her savagely&mdash; savagely&mdash;strong, sweet,
  overwhelming. You will make her tell the secret. Win it from her. Make her
  tell it to you. Henrietta may demand your promise not to tell the secret to
  Wu Tu. You will make that promise. Henrietta, does not know Marie. It will be
  Marie, not Wu Tu, to whom you will tell it. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What secret will you find out?"</p>

  <p>"Henrietta's."</p>

  <p>"What is it? Answer."</p>

  <p>"The secret of the Woman of Gaglajung."</p>

  <p>"Will you tell it to Wu Tu?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"But to whom will you tell it?"</p>

  <p>"Marie."</p>

  <p>"Nothing is important except Henrietta's secret. You will make her tell it
  to you. It is so important that you will rather die than not learn it. You
  will learn it from her. You will tell it to me. Answer. To whom will you tell
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Marie."</p>

  <p>"At once to Marie?"</p>

  <p>"At once to Marie."</p>

  <p>Her thigh muscle moved. He felt her leaning forward as if listening. Down
  at the far end of the low opening the Chinese girl coughed on a peculiar note
  and made noises by shifting the lantern. The sounds appeared to convey
  information. Wu Tu relaxed a little. Then she laid both hands on Blair's
  forehead and continued:</p>

  <p>"Taron Ling is the enemy. Are you afraid of Taron Ling?"</p>

  <p>Not knowing on the spur of the moment how to answer that question, Blair
  was silent. A principle of hypnotism is to tell the victim what to answer
  before asking a question. This one might be a trick, to discover whether he
  was really under hypnotic control. She repeated it. He continued silent. If
  it was a test, she appeared satisfied. She resumed:</p>

  <p>"Taron Ling is the enemy. Answer. Who is the enemy?"</p>

  <p>"Taron Ling."</p>

  <p>"You do not fear Taron Ling. You despise him. You do not fear him in the
  least. He has no power over you, no influence over you. You do not fear Taron
  Ling. He only knows a little silly magic such as works on superstitious
  fools. He may be able to control Bat-Brahmins and hermits, but not you and
  you don't fear him, because Marie protects you from him. Answer. Do you fear
  Taron Ling?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Who protects you from him? Answer."</p>

  <p>"Marie."</p>

  <p>"When you awake you will not remember Taron Ling. You will remember Marie,
  your friend. You will obey her because you understand' her, and she loves you
  and protects you. Answer. Whom will you obey when you awake?"</p>

  <p>"Marie."</p>

  <p>Again she appeared to be listening, for the space of forty or fifty
  heart-beats. Again the Chinese girl made noises that perhaps conveyed
  information. They ceased. Against the sound of splashing water Blair could
  hear Wu Tu's heartbeat and his own&mdash;out of time with each
  other&mdash;hers fluttering fast. It was nearly a minute before she
  continued:</p>

  <p>"Chetusingh is a treacherous swine and a liar. Chetusingh is Taron Ling's
  dupe. Certain women put some poison into him to make him sensible but Taron
  Ling deceived him, made him see things, and confused him. Now he is doubly
  treacherous, obeying first one and then the other. He will try to kill Taron
  Ling. But Taron Ling will kill him. It doesn't matter. Chetusingh has served
  his purpose, which was to go with a message to Henrietta before daybreak,
  saying you wished her to accompany him for secret reasons. Henrietta will ask
  you, was it a true message? You will say yes. Answer. Was it a true
  message?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Chetusingh is a traitor, but he gave a true message to Henrietta. But now
  he betrays her. He betrays you. He is a swine of a Christian convert. You
  hate Chetusingh. Answer."</p>

  <p>"I hate Chetusingh."</p>

  <p>"You love Marie because she guards you against Chetusingh and Taron Ling,
  who are a pair of devils. What are they? Answer."</p>

  <p>"Devils."</p>

  <p>"Let us hope they kill each, other. All men die who seek the secret of the
  Woman of Gaglajung. Frensham sought it. And where is he? What happened to
  Zaman Ali and those others? They are dead&mdash;dead&mdash;dead. But
  Henrietta is to be the mother of Blair's children, not a victim of the Woman
  of Gaglajung, whose curse is on all who violate her Secret. Save Henrietta
  from that! I, Marie; fear no curse. I violate no secret. I will take all
  consequences. I am Marie, rich in wisdom. I will know and preserve the secret
  in my heart of hearts I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused, trembling with excitement. Her hands pressed on Blair's
  forehead. Emotion poured along them, like a stream of will; it was
  contagious, but not as she meant it to be. It sharpened the intensity of
  Blair's resistance and revived his energy. His thought worked wholly
  independently of hers. He saw the logical conclusion of her purpose. Should
  she learn the secret she would try to kill both Henrietta and himself. She
  would share it with no one.</p>

  <p>But she feared Taron Ling, that was evident. Fear of Chetusingh, too,
  might explain why she had inveighed against him. That was a point in
  Chetusingh's favor. Almost super-humanly crafty in some, respects, Chetusingh
  might risk the chance of being killed for treachery, in order to gain an
  objective.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu's weakness was her belief in her own hypnotic power; but without
  drugs to assist her she was only an amateur. Chetusingh would appreciate
  that. He might have found some way of avoiding the effect of the drugs. If
  so, his obvious cue was to pretend to be hypnotised. He had always been the
  best actor on the police force. By convincing Wu Tu that he was thoroughly
  hypnotised, Chetusingh might overhear or worm his way into her secret plans.
  Supposing he had learned of her intention to hypnotise Blair, he would guess
  what Blair would do about it. They had worked together too often and
  successfully for him not to guess that Blair would pretend to fall into the
  trap. Chetusingh from that minute received benefit of doubt.</p>

  <p>"Wake!" commanded Wu Tu. "Wake and remember all I told you! Wake!"</p>

  <p>He lay still. If he came too quickly out of the trance she might suspect
  him. She began slapping his face. "Wake! Wake!"</p>

  <p>But he lay still.</p>

  <p>The Chinese girl returned with the lantern, and held it to his face, but
  that light was not strong enough to make him blink. So she produced an
  electric torch from one of the hampers and flashed that full in his eyes. The
  glare was unendurable. He let his eyelids flutter. The girl wet a cloth at
  the cistern and slapped his face with it. He came to then, sat up and looked
  bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Do you know who I am?"</p>

  <p>He looked into Wu Tu's eyes. He allowed recognition and pleasure to creep
  into his.</p>

  <p>"Marie," he answered. Then, as if he suddenly remembered why and what:
  "Where's Henrietta? I must ask her something." He got up, feeling stiff and a
  bit uneasy but alert and competent. He put his arm around Wu Tu and spoke
  caressingly: "Did I turn down your offer in Bombay? That was silly of me.
  You're the one to trust. A man can tell you anything. You keep secrets."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;yes&mdash;I keep them!" she said it with set teeth.</p>

  <p>He snatched the torch from the Chinese girl, flashed it around the walls
  as if he had forgotten where he was, and turned it at last on two dead
  bodies. He recognized both! Those men had stood at the foot of the stairs in
  Wu Tu's house in Bombay.</p>

  <p>"Who?" he demanded, putting a hand over his eyes as if trying to
  remember.</p>

  <p>"My servants, Blair. You killed them&mdash;shot one&mdash;stabbed one. But
  I won't tell who did it. Look."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't remember killing them," Blair said.</p>

  <p>"No wonder. They hit you hard. They and that swine Chetusingh attacked you
  suddenly. You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He bent down and examined the bodies. He remembered he had held the dagger
  in his left hand, the revolver in his right. One man was shot through the
  heart; he very likely had killed that one. But the dagger was between the
  other man's shoulder-blades in such a position that he could not possibly
  have done that left-handed. Someone else had used the dagger. Someone must
  have snatched it from his hand as he fell&mdash;must have driven it to the
  hilt into the man's back from behind. There could be no drug now remaining in
  the handle of that weapon! It was a blow of which neither Wu Tu nor the
  Chinese girl was capable. Wu Tu, he remembered, had been clinging to his
  knees; she could not possibly have done it. Chetusingh was the only
  alternative. It was just such a blow as Chetusingh would strike, if put to
  it&mdash;Rajput-fashion&mdash;no half-measures.</p>

  <p>"But I don't remember this," he said. "I don't remember it."</p>

  <p>"They hit you on the head," Wu Tu repeated.</p>

  <p>"Your face is wet, isn't it? We bathed it, to make you recover. What do
  you remember?"</p>

  <p>"Henrietta!" he said instantly. "Where is she?"</p>

  <p>Wu Tu nodded to herself. Blair looked away from her to hide the triumph
  that he knew was in his eyes. He had her beaten. Checkmate now in one or two
  moves.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch11"

  <p class="quote">I have had one hundred and one <i>chelas</i>, of whom one
  alone had too much wisdom in him to demand why I, his Teacher, had revealed
  to him no great hidden secrets. Are they not hidden? Are they not hidden in
  each one's consciousness? I am a Teacher. I am a gardener, awaiting sun,
  rain, growth; observant and perhaps, if diligent, preventing trespass. I can
  cultivate, prune, encourage. I protect. But the seed is within you. As the
  yearning of the lover to reveal true love to his beloved, is the hunger of
  the Teacher to reveal the Secrets to his <i>chela</i>. Unto love, and unto
  love alone, love shows herself, as a reflection in a pond at sunrise. Unto
  inward wisdom. Wisdom is revealed. Truth echoes Truth. All else, in the words
  of your Gospel, is pearls that the swine tread underfoot.</p>

  <p class="quote">&mdash;From the First of the Nine Books of Noor Ali.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT SEEMED probable that Wu Tu would behave herself for the
  time being. Murder might be in her mind, but what she wanted first was
  Henrietta's secret. Blair was as keen as Wu Tu on that. But what the devil
  should he say to Henrietta? Even supposing he should get rid of Wu Tu
  somehow, and then find Henrietta, there still might be one or two of Wu Tu's
  men to be dealt with. She was much more likely than Zaman Ali to have
  well-paid and therefore faithful adherents, who would probably have weapons.
  He had none. There was a weapon available, but to have pulled that dagger
  from the dead man's body would have alarmed Wu Tu. He was better without a
  weapon than with her suspicion aroused. Her over-confidence was
  all-important. In the dim chamber, with the red glow from the lantern on her
  face and the electric torch revealing a panorama o weirdly shaped golden
  figures as a setting, Wu Tu looked hardly human. Mystery had taken hold of
  her imagination. She looked hungry, determined, cruel.</p>

  <p>She undoubtedly believed she was using occult forces. There is nothing
  comparable to the obscene fury of the would-be magician whose mental
  treacheries are circumvented. She would be like a baffled cobra if
  disillusioned. She might kill Henrietta out of sheer spite.</p>

  <p>"Why do you wait?" Wu Tu demanded suddenly. He was not so sure then that
  he had her beaten. The dilemma was obvious. She was testing the control of
  her will over his, directing him mentally, using a form of telepathy that has
  sent many a weakling to the gallows. The difficulty was, her thought made no
  impression on him; he was unable to detect the slightest tremor of directing
  impulse. He had never been able to let his thought be directed by others,
  although he and Chetusingh had tried to practice it for the sake of better
  teamwork. However, he decided to pretend to receive directions and to take
  the chance of making a wrong turning.</p>

  <p>The Chinese girl snatched at the torch but he pushed her aside roughly,
  turned the light on the entrance-hole and started forward as if he had
  suddenly received an overpowering impulse. But he wondered whether that was
  the right thing to do. His confidence, that had been so strong a few minutes
  before, was waning. He would have preferred to have Wu Tu in front of him
  where he could see her.</p>

  <p>The Chinese girl followed him so closely, and so fast, that his spine
  tingled, as he hurried oil hands and knees through the low passage. True, he
  did not expect to be stabbed. He reassured himself that there was not the
  slightest fear of that until Wu Tu should have attained her objective. But
  there was no doubt about the crawling sensation it gave him to have the girl
  so close behind. At the far end of the opening he stood up instantly and
  flashed the light in her face. She only smiled. It was the friendliest smile
  she had given him yet, But she was quite possibly laughing at his discomfort
  or at the disreputable state of his clothing. It would be like a Chinese to
  do that, at that moment. She said nothing. Wu Tu came through the opening
  slowly, not on her hands and knees but bent double, pausing repeatedly,
  appearing to listen, either in deadly fear of Taron Ling, or possibly
  expecting reinforcements.</p>

  <p>Blair turned to the right and started down the tunnel, with the idea of
  reaching daylight before reinforcements could come. The prospect of some more
  enemies in the dark was even worse than the dread of the climb up those
  projecting steps on the flank of the pit. However, it seemed he had turned
  the wrong way. Wu Tu betrayed the strain she was under.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" she commanded, pointing tragically with her left arm toward black
  darkness. He turned the torch on the darkness beyond the low chamber
  entrance. It revealed an opening in the rock wall. He entered. It turned
  left, right, left again into the rock, not wide enough for two abreast, but
  high enough for that ancient giantess to. have used it without stooping.
  After three zigzag turns he found himself in a clean-cut, smooth, descending
  passage, in which there was bat-filth but plenty of air.</p>

  <p>He wet his finger. The draught of air came toward him. There were marks
  here and there in the filth that resembled human footprints, but it was very
  difficult to distinguish them by torchlight. Walking was not easy; the narrow
  floor was worn trough-shape and was nowhere more than three feet wide, but
  the walls sloped outward, so that at the height of his head the passage had a
  width of four or five feet. The roof was irregular and gave foot-hold to
  hundreds of bats that squirmed and squeaked as the light disturbed them.</p>

  <p>The passage curved and turned on itself without any evident reason. There
  was not a fault in the walls anywhere&mdash;no carvings, ornaments,
  inscriptions. Direction was very difficult to keep in mind, but his
  impression was that he had made almost a complete circuit and had descended
  fifty or sixty feet, if not more, when at last he saw indirect daylight that
  streamed across the passage fifty feet ahead, where there was a sharp
  right-hand turn. Facing the turn, on the left, there was a slot-like opening
  into which the light poured.</p>

  <p>The opening revealed a dim chamber with a shelf all around it, similar to
  the one from which he had just come. The wall was damp where water poured out
  of one hole and into another, but there was no cistern. The place had been'
  cleaned out recently. Facing the light was one huge, apparently golden figure
  that resembled nothing recognizable or comprehensible, unless it was an
  effort to suggest unknown dimensions. If it really was gold its weight and
  value beggared imagination. Near it was a plain camp-cot that had been
  recently used; the pillow bore the imprint of some one's head. The clean
  white overlying sheet was rumpled. Near the cot, on the floor, were a plain
  enamel wash-bowl, towels and a hamper that might contain food. Beside those,
  also on the floor, were two large suitcases, both marked H.F.</p>

  <p>Blair went straight to the cot and discovered a vanity case beneath the
  pillow. He recognized that instantly as Henrietta's. Wu Tu, as quiet as a
  mouse, came in behind him and stood by the suitcases. He scowled as he turned
  and faced her. The Chinese girl, dirty, disheveled, impudent, hovered behind
  Wu Tu, looking like her evil genius. She leered at the bags and vanity case
  as if her thought possessively explored their contents. That brought Blair's
  anger suddenly to the surface. Speech exploded from him:</p>

  <p>"Get out of here, both of you!"</p>

  <p>Wu Tu smiled. Her shoulders relaxed, as if his anger resolved a doubt. But
  her smile looked ghastly in the light that streamed through the opening. She
  looked fifty years old, with strained eyes and the suppleness gone from her
  limbs. Mentally as well as physically she seemed exhausted. She sat down on
  the cot.</p>

  <p>"No, you get out of here," she answered. "Find Henrietta." She reached for
  the vanity case and Blair snatched it away. The suitcases were closed but
  unlocked; he put the vanity case inside the nearest one and reclosed the
  catches. Then he pushed both suitcases under the cot.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Wu Tu, "you do love her. Find her. She is your woman."</p>

  <p>That enraged him. But Blair's anger never governed him for more than
  fractions of a second. Instead it stirred his self-control and set him
  calculating. If Wu Tu felt so sure she had him hypnotised that she was
  willing he should interview Henrietta lone, why disillusion her? Besides, he
  did not know yet how to get out of the caverns; Wu Tu very likely did know.
  It was important to get that information before challenging her
  vindictiveness. He, too, was weary in every fiber of his being; it was easy
  to look beaten.</p>

  <p>He strode to the water, drank from his cupped hands, bathed his eyes to
  take away the smart of sleeplessness, stared at Wu Tu as if he hardly
  recognized her, and walked out like a man in a dream. Behind him Wu Tu spoke
  in Chinese. When he glanced over his shoulder she already lay sprawled on the
  cot with her head on the pillow. She seemed to be failing under the strain.
  The girl was massaging her feet. Immediate interruption from that quarter
  appeared improbable.</p>

  <p>Blinking, he walked straight toward strong daylight. Twenty feet beyond
  where the passage turned it came to a sudden end at a strangely carved
  opening with a wide stone threshold, almost exactly like the one at "the foot
  of the projecting steps, the thought of which still made him shudder. But
  this opening was much closer to the bottom of the great pit.</p>

  <p>Looking up, he could see the other threshold, and some of the ghastly
  steps beyond it, like broken teeth stuck oh the smooth rock. The great cone
  in the midst of the pit was far above the level of his eyes and looked creamy
  white from that angle. It was no longer transparent and he could not see the
  woman. From the threshold where he stood a flight of irregular steps
  descended to the floor of the pit; they were like the steps higher up except
  that these were much less difficult. There was no other way to go.</p>

  <p>He went down, slowly, accustoming his eyes to the light and keeping close
  to the wall for safety; he was so tired that he could hardly trust his
  sinews.</p>

  <p>The light was not nearly as dazzling as it had been; His watch had
  stopped, no doubt broken, but he knew it must be long after, noon. From where
  he was, he could not see the sky, but it was obvious that the sun ho longer
  shone directly into the cavern. There was a wide shadow at the foot of the
  wall. The floor of the pit lay in waves of creamy stalagmite; almost like wax
  from a guttered candle; but farther away where the light was more direct and
  stronger it looked like mother-of-pearl. One gorged vulture was perched on a
  wave of the stuff to his left, and he could hear atrocious, echoed noises
  made by others that tore at dead men's bodies out of sight in some hollow
  beyond. Many of the waves of stalagmite were more than head-high, but a
  smooth, worn, narrow track wound among them snakewise in the general
  direction of the central mound, on which the great cone glowed with color
  that changed at each step he took. The cone fascinated; it was almost a
  physical impossibility not to stare at it.</p>

  <p>The echoes of his footsteps were awe-inspiring and like no sounds he had
  ever heard. There was an extraordinary sensation of commuting sacrilege. He
  felt like taking off his boots, to prevent the echoes from making his skin
  crawl; some of the echoes seemed to come creeping stealthily behind him. That
  sensation was so real that he glanced backward to see whether he was being
  followed. Then, in that second, he heard Henrietta's voice so close to him
  that he almost jumped out of his skin.</p>

  <p>"Blair, is there no getting away from you?"</p>

  <p>The training of a lifetime saved him from making an hysterical exhibition
  of himself. If nerves had voices, his would have shrieked. Between anger,
  surprise, relief, astonishment, his silence congealed like something
  solid.</p>

  <p>"Wu Tu sent you?"</p>

  <p>That stung him. Anger Overwhelmed all the other emotions. Like a man in
  the ring taking punishment, he hid the sting, banked anger, smiled
  mercilessly. The change in his expression frightened her. Words died on her
  parted lips.</p>

  <p>Behind her was a canvas camp-chair on which she had been sitting. She was
  wearing a frock like the one of the night before, that had made her look so
  beautiful by moonlight. The frock was quite clean. She was barefooted; her
  kicked-off sandals lay beside the chair. She was standing within a stone
  dome, like a soap-bubble, except that the film of stalagmite of which it was
  formed was at least a foot thick.</p>

  <p>He saw her through an opening, three or four feet wide, eight or nine feet
  high, hewn wider at the top than at the bottom. A rectangular pattern of
  light poured through that opening, and lay on the floor like a golden carpet.
  Other opalescent, dim light penetrated through the thin stone; it was like
  light through a stained glass window, subdued and mystic. It stirred in Blair
  a maddening sense of beauty&mdash;the emotion that some men shout about but
  others cherish in excited silence.</p>

  <p>He had never loved any girl as he did her in that moment. Never was he
  less inclined' to speak of it or to reveal it, or even to confess it to
  himself. His tired senses yearned to her. Mind, memory, intellect all blended
  in a sudden recognition of her as his woman, his and his only, adorable loot
  of the battle of life, to be seized, had, held and cherished. But resentment
  burned a no-man's land between them, and her eyes grew pained, brave,
  regretful as they met his, unflinching.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, forcing his voice at last. "Wu Tu did send me." He said it
  cruelly, through set teeth. It hurt him. He intended it should hurt her. How
  could he say he loved her? She believed he was Wu Tu's lover, or something
  like it. Could he deny Wu Tu had. sent him? He even perceived a ghastly
  possibility that Wu Tu's influence was stronger on him than he knew.</p>

  <p>Was he his own master? This flood of emotion&mdash; was it genuine? Was he
  reacting to Wu Tu's mental influence? That was no moment to speak, think or
  behave as a lover. If he should ever come to take Henrietta in his arms, that
  should be his own, not Wu Tu's doing. The more he loved Henrietta, the more
  savagely he cursed Wu Tu. His eyes glowered with indignation.</p>

  <p>"Why have you come?" Henrietta asked. "Blair, do you know what a state
  you're in? Are you hurt?" She shuddered. "I saw a vulture. Someone fell off
  the ledge, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His stare silenced her. She stepped backward, afraid of him. But he via.'s
  only wondering what the devil to say to her. Suddenly the obvious question
  forced its way through set teeth:</p>

  <p>"Are you all right? Not hurt?"</p>

  <p>"Quite all right, thanks. Blair, go away, please, for a while. Chetusingh
  said you would come, but I didn't believe him."</p>

  <p>The policeman surged to the surface. He retorted hoarsely:</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you believe him?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I? There was nothing to stop you yourself from telling me, was
  there? Why should you send Chetusingh with such a message less than twenty
  minutes after I had left your camp?"</p>

  <p>"Very well, why did you go with Chetusingh?"</p>

  <p>"Because I wished to come here. I didn't trust Chetusingh, but I would
  have gone with almost anyone who mentioned this place, even at the risk of
  meeting you again and being tortured with questions. But I was almost sure
  the message was a trap. I knew well what they wanted me for."</p>

  <p>"What who wanted you for?"</p>

  <p>"Wu Tu's agents. They had watched me in here. Wu Tu questioned me in
  Bombay as I told you, and her men have watched me ever since. They kept me
  out recently by making the Bat-Brahmin afraid to admit me."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they thought they might make me talk. But I didn't. I refused to
  bargain with them."</p>

  <p>Blair stepped in through the opening.&mdash;He sat down, on the floor with
  his back to the wall, too tired to stand any longer. He nodded to her to take
  the chair.</p>

  <p>"Blair, are you ill?" He dismissed the suggestion with a shake of the head
  that let him realize how much his head ached.</p>

  <p>"Look here. Henrietta, there's been hell to pay&mdash;men
  murdered&mdash;God knows what else. If you'd confided in me, in the first
  instance none of that might have happened! Tell now."</p>

  <p>"Blair, there are things I can't tell."</p>

  <p>"Will you answer questions?"</p>

  <p>"If I do, will you leave me alone afterwards?"</p>

  <p>She sat down, folding her hands in her lap. He stared at her in silence
  for about a minute. Leave her alone? Not likely! He and she were going to
  know less loneliness than she imagined, but it was no time to discuss that;
  He ignored her question.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Wu Tu?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Yes; Wu Tu was in the cavern when I came here, just before daylight. Up
  on that ledge she and I saw the dawn. come through the opening. There were
  two men and a rope ready to help me down those steps, but heights don't scare
  me. I've been up and down them alone at least a dozen times. I didn't need
  help. And I couldn't refuse to come down. They'd have forced me if I
  didn't.</p>

  <p>"Wu Tu was perfectly polite, but I knew what she meant. She came after
  me&mdash;she and her maid, and when we reached the lower cavern, there were
  my "suitcases, and food, and a cot. Wu Tu went away for a while then and left
  me alone with the Chinese maid. My frock was filthy, so I changed it, and the
  maid waited on me. After that I was sleepy, so I lay on the cot. I didn't
  sleep very long. Wu Tu came back and tried to hypnotise me."</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about that," Blair ordered.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing much to tell. I awoke and knew at once what she was
  trying to do. She couldn't possibly. I think she realized it."</p>

  <p>"What was she trying to get you to do?"</p>

  <p>"To tell her the secret of Gaglajung."</p>

  <p>"If you know that, you're going to tell it to me," he said grimly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head and made one of her exasperating answers: "When Wu Tu
  couldn't hypnotise me, she asked would I tell the secret to my sweetheart? I
  haven't one. I said so. Now she sends you."</p>

  <p>Blair's response was more like a snarl than a laugh. He hated to have his
  hand forced by Wu Tu's impudence, but there was nothing else for it, he must
  play his last card. He decided to do it, then, that instant. He got up and
  walked toward her, knowing he looked unprepossessing, to put it mildly,
  unshaven, in a filthy uniform.</p>

  <p>"Henrietta," he said. "Look me straight in the eyes. That secret's in the
  line of duty. I'm going to know it whatever it costs. Last, night you said,
  if I were your lover, you'd try to tell me. Go ahead then and try! Goddammit,
  I hate to admit, I love you when there's an obvious ulterior motive. Damn Wu
  Tu to hell for that! But I'm telling the truth. Don't interrupt. I'll not
  behave like a lover&mdash;not now&mdash;I'm all over bat-filth. Listen."</p>

  <p>There was nothing to do but listen to him. Blair, in that mood, was
  overwhelming, deaf to argument and blind to opposition. He stood over her.
  There was no avoiding his eyes.</p>

  <p>After one swift and searching gaze she closed hers. That veil, that he had
  sworn the night before would cover her if she were naked, seemed almost to
  materialize out of the weird light. It increased his vehemence. He set to
  work to tear the imagined veil to shreds, with ruthless down-strokes of
  self-revelation, the more violent because he restrained all actual
  gesture.</p>

  <p>"You want to fall out of love with me? Dammit, you can't. I won't let you.
  I'm in love with you up to the hilt. If that entitles me to know your secret,
  tell it. But I warn you, your lover is one thing; Blair Warrender the
  policeman is another, who'll listen&mdash;and do his duty."</p>

  <p>Her upward glance lingered a moment. Then she looked down at her naked
  feet until all signs of emotion had vanished, except from her eyes. He was
  about to speak when she looked up again and asked him:</p>

  <p>"Do you think the policeman would know what his duty is?"</p>

  <p>"Try me," he retorted.</p>

  <p>"To oblige Wu Tu?"</p>

  <p>He took hold of her shoulders and almost lifted her out of the chair. She
  stood up, facing him, and they were silent. He was furiously seeking right
  words. He rejected phrase after phrase as futile, unworthy, meaningless. He
  hated cant. Jargon at that moment would be blasphemy. But he could not make
  words obey him. It was she who spoke first:</p>

  <p>"Blair, it's the first time I've ever seen exactly that look in your
  eyes."</p>

  <p>"Well, what of it?" he exploded. "It's the first time I've said I love
  you. isn't it? You're looking straight at the truth. And by God, if you throw
  Wu Tu in my teeth again I'll go and kill her. She has been trying to
  hypnotise me, to make me do just what I am doing. She believes, if you'll
  tell me your secret, I'll tell it to her. I'm making love to you?"</p>

  <p>"With your thumbs? Blair, you're&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By God, I'm sorry. Did I hurt?" He took her in his arms, hugged her to
  him, kissed the red marks where his thumbs had pressed her shoulders.
  "Journey's end!" he said. "And only God knows why it didn't happen
  sooner!"</p>

  <p>"Blair, yours feel like everlasting arms!"</p>

  <p>"So they should. It's forever."</p>

  <p>"Blair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait. I've something else to say now. Keep your secret. Do you hear me?
  I'm not buying it. Until you're satisfied that Wu Tu hasn't put this over on
  me. I'd as soon you didn't tell me. You, and I&mdash;dammit, I won't spoil
  this. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered. "I understand you. Blair, there's nothing I won't
  tell you&mdash;nothing. But if you don't understand, you mustn't blame
  yourself or me. I love you. I believe you. And I will trust you to the end of
  the world, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was about to interrupt. Words were obeying him at last. Emotion, as he
  held her in his arms; broke down the dam that normally restrained his speech.
  Words that he had never used to any woman marched before his mind in splendid
  sequence. But she tried to push him away. She stiffened suddenly. He held her
  tight and glanced, from instinct, over-shoulder in the direction she was
  facing. Then he, too, stiffened.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu stood in the entrance. Her eyes glinted avarice. There was fight in
  her. Her smile was Borgian&mdash;sly, ingratiating, ruthless. She was
  stooping slightly forward, with a hand on each side of the narrow opening.
  She looked horribly old, as if Time, in the last hour, had overtaken her and
  stripped her of all but her determined will to live. It was several seconds
  before she spoke:</p>

  <p>"Tricked me, did you? Too full of Taron Ling for Marie to control you? Oh,
  yes?"</p>

  <p>Wu Tu came in. The Chinese girl appeared then, behind her, standing in the
  entrance. Wu Tu removed the electric torch from the chair-seat and sat down
  uninvited. The Chinese girl squatted in the entrance, lit a cigarette and
  smoked it insolently; she achieved a gesture with her cigarette-tube that
  almost shouted aloud of secret and insuperable resources.</p>

  <p>"Well? What?" Blair demanded.</p>

  <p>"She will tell you now," said Wu Tu. "She is your woman. Didn't I say it?"
  She nodded to herself, watching his eyes, and when she spoke again there was
  a hard, unfamiliar note in her voice: "But you won't tell me&mdash;eh? You
  thought you fooled me, did you? Well, I'll tell you something! Chetusingh is
  dead. Taron Ling killed him. I have spoken with Taron Ling. He killed him. He
  waits! There is no way. out except the way we came in, and the
  other&mdash;the Secret way! Let her tell it or take the consequences! Deal
  with me or Taron Ling! We four against Taron Ling, or you lose
  Henrietta!"</p>

  <p>She had something beneath a fold of her sari, but Blair could not see what
  it was. Henrietta nudged him to call his attention to it. He suspected a
  weapon; she might easily have had one cached somewhere and have fetched it as
  soon as his back was turned. There was no mistaking the glitter in her eyes.
  She was desperate, determined&mdash;quite probably mad. The Chinese girl
  looked over-confident but alertly on guard. The look of confidence changed to
  alarm when suddenly, through the opening, there came a sound that might be an
  echoing footfall. She stood up&mdash; stood on tiptoe, craning her neck.</p>

  <p>"Taron Ling!" said Wu Tu, and got out of the chair. Her expression became
  ghastly. Her voice, too, seemed to have grown old in a moment.</p>

  <p>"You or Taron Ling!" she exclaimed and whipped out a nickel-plated
  small-bore automatic.</p>

  <p>"Poisoned bullets! What now?"</p>

  <p>The Chinese girl produced another automatic and covered Blair with it. She
  handled the weapon nervously, but it was a range at which even a duffer could
  hardly miss, and the nervousness made her doubly dangerous. Blair stepped in
  front of Henrietta and stood still, listening. Wu Tu was too full of purpose
  to listen; she ground out words like a panther's snarls:</p>

  <p>"Show your hand, Blair! Which? I'm shooting you or Taron Ling! Which is
  it?"</p>

  <p>Henrietta whispered. Blair could not hear what, but he noticed she was
  frightened; until then, although she had detested Wu Tu she had not seemed in
  the least afraid of her. The worst of it was that he, too, felt afraid. Wu Tu
  was mad. He was sure of it. At one and the same moment he had to watch Wu Tu,
  speculating as to what her next move might be, and try to listen to that
  sound outside. It resembled a footfall, but it seemed to come no nearer. It
  might be a signal.</p>

  <p>]f it was Chetusingh, that only complicated matters. And who else could it
  be? Wu Tu might not have lied. It was quite possible that Chetusingh had
  discovered Taron Ling's dead body, and under cover of darkness, had whispered
  to her, making her believe he was Taron Ling. But if Wu Tu should learn that
  now, she would shoot for a certainty. She went on snarling:</p>

  <p>"Taron Ling gets Henrietta if I shoot you! Do you hear me? He'll make her
  talk. I'll shoot him afterwards. Speak now! Do you make her tell? Or do
  I?"</p>

  <p>The sound outside grew louder, but not nearer. It resembled a footfall on
  echoing rock, made by someone wearing slippers who rutched his feet.
  Tap-tap-tap-rutch&mdash;tap-rutch-tap-rutch&mdash;
  tap-tap-rutch-rutch-rutch-tap&mdash;"Carry on while I go for assistance,"
  that meant. Pause. Then again the tap-tap-tap-rutch&mdash;It was Chetusingh's
  signal.</p>

  <p>The problem was to answer it without informing Wu Tu. Unless it were
  answered, Chetusingh might come nearer. If Wu Tu should learn it was he, not
  Taron Ling, she would leap to conclusions and probably shoot Blair instantly.
  She looked desperate enough to tackle Chetusingh then; she and the Chinese
  girl might lie in ambush for him; or the Chinese girl might do it while Wu Tu
  stood guard over Henrietta. What she would do after that to Henrietta was
  something that Blair preferred not to guess. How to answer that signal?</p>

  <p>He had to be quick.</p>

  <p>"Half a minute," he said as calmly as he could, half-turning toward
  Henrietta but keeping his eyes on Wu Tu. "I don't know the secret yet. I will
  ask her to tell it to me. Let me talk to her alone a moment. You don't
  listen."</p>

  <p>With his right arm around Henrietta he passed behind the chair. It was the
  kind that can be taken apart and rolled up; the top piece came away easily
  when he grasped it in his left hand. Wu Tu thought he meant to use that as a
  weapon and said one word in Chinese; she and the Chinese girl crouched
  instantly, aiming their automatics like desperate amateurs.</p>

  <p>"Poisoned bullets!" said Wu Tu.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to make a noise with this," he answered. "You're not to hear
  what I say, that's all."</p>

  <p>The place was almost circular. He led Henrietta to the wall, exactly
  opposite the opening, wondering whether sound would travel out of the place
  more distinctly than it crept in. He struck the wall hard with the piece of
  wood&mdash;tap-pause-tap-tap, for attention. and whatever the effect might
  be, outside the din was deafening under that glass-like root. Wu Tu could not
  possibly hear what lie said. He changed his signal to tap-tap-long
  pause-tap-tap, and kept repeating it.</p>

  <p>"That means, 'your signal understood,'" he said to Henrietta. "We'll have
  help soon. We've got to gain time. Taron Ling is dead. Wu Tu doesn't know
  it." He kept on hammering the wall, with an eye on Wu Tu, estimating her
  impatience. "Will you temporise? Offer to tell? Pretend to tell, to gain
  time?"</p>

  <p>Henrietta nodded. "I would rather die than tell her. I will tell you. Then
  you do as you please."</p>

  <p>He ceased hammering and threw away the stick. "Miss Frensham is afraid of
  Taron Ling." he said to Wu Tu. "She will tell me the secret on condition that
  you keep Taron Ling at a distance. Can you do it?"</p>

  <p>"Taron Ling is afraid of poisoned bullets." Wu Tu answered. "That's why he
  daren't come near unless I summon him." But she herself looked wretchedly
  afraid&mdash;obsessed by the explosive fear that is the strength of
  madness.</p>

  <p>Blair spoke to her in an almost confidential tone: "Leave us alone while
  we talk. You and that girl keep Taron Ling away. Get outside there and
  watch." But he knew that was only 'a lame expedient. If help should come, Wu
  Tu would be aware of it first. She looked desperate enough to do instant
  murder then, and after that to shoot the girl and herself in baffled rage and
  disappointment. However, any expedient was better than none. Contempt and
  cunning showed on Wu Tu's face. She was about to answer when Henrietta
  interrupted. She stepped forward, freeing herself from Blair's arm, and faced
  Wu Tu with a restraint of gesture that revealed rather than disguised
  loathing. But she spoke gently:</p>

  <p>"You have worked for months to get this secret, Wu Tu, haven't you? I
  would never have told it to you. However, I can't let Mr. Warrender be shot,
  so I will tell him. He may tell you. But not in this place."</p>

  <p>"Where?" Wu Tu demanded. She growled like a dog; within a space of hours
  she had become a hag, with a voice like rasping metal.</p>

  <p>"You shall see where we go," said Henrietta. "You may follow, but you must
  not come near or interrupt until the moon shines through the opening up
  there."</p>

  <p>"Hours!" snarled Wu Tu.</p>

  <p>"Not many hours. You must keep Taron Ling at a distance. Otherwise I'm
  helpless. I'm afraid of him. I can do nothing with Taron Ling near me."</p>

  <p>Wu Tu grinned and glared: "Do you know what Taron Ling will do to you
  unless you&mdash;" Blair interrupted. Madness feeds on threats of that sort.
  There was one chance in a hundred that she might believe her hypnotic efforts
  had partially succeeded. It was worth trying.</p>

  <p>"Marie," he began, "I thought you&mdash;" He hesitated, putting a hand to
  his eyes as if perplexed by a haunting memory.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu glowered at him. "Yes," she said, "I'm Marie. You remember?"</p>

  <p>Henrietta spoke before Blair could answer:</p>

  <p>"Listen, Wu Tu. He and I have promised. But it isn't possible until
  moonlight. I need rest&mdash;sleep. So does Mr. Warrender. I can't sleep
  unless you protect us against Taron Ling; and unless I get some sleep I can't
  do what you ask."</p>

  <p>"Sleep here," said Wu Tu, glancing at the entrance. "Taron Ling can't
  enter." She flourished her automatic.</p>

  <p>"Even though I have to trust you to ]3rotect me, I don't like you,"
  Henrietta answered. "I must be in the right mood to reveal this secret. You
  make that impossible. I came here to be alone, to grow calm and collect my
  thoughts. I must begin again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now that you're happy?" Wu Tu interrupted, hag-leering, incredible. Evil
  had come and clothed her suddenly in Time's bark. She even looked wrinkled.
  "It is thanks to me you are happy&mdash;isn't it?"</p>

  <p>The argument was getting nowhere, and it was growing twilight dark. The
  danger increased with darkness. The electric torch lay on the floor. Blair
  made a sudden stride toward it. Wu Tu squeaked in Chinese and the Chinese
  girl, on hands and knees, was there ahead of him. She snatched the torch and
  covered Blair with her automatic. He took a deadly chance then&mdash;all or
  nothing. Henrietta gasped and distracted Wu Tu's attention for a second by
  springing forward in an agony of excitement. Blair kicked the pistol out of
  the girl's hand, made a dive for it, caught it before it fell and was back
  within six feet of Wu Tu before she could turn and face him.</p>

  <p>"Drop that pistol!" he commanded. She raised it slowly.</p>

  <p>"Damn you&mdash;I said&mdash;<i>drop</i> it!" He could not see the Chinese
  girl. He could see Henrietta. The Chinese girl sprang from
  behind&mdash;seized his wrist&mdash;clung like a cat with teeth and
  finger-nails. In that same fraction of a second Henrietta sprang at Wu Tu,
  seized her wrist and tried to snatcH the pistol. Wu Tu pulled the trigger.
  The shot was deafening. A lump of stalagmite fell from the roof with a crash.
  The Chinese girl clung to Blair's wrist; he dragged her until he could reach
  Wu Tu. She fired a second shot, wild as the first. Then in a second he had
  both weapons, and with Wu Tu's pistol he rapped the Chinese girl's knuckles
  until she let go and walked away to look for her cigarette tube.</p>

  <p>She was as suddenly indifferent as she had been recklessly determined.
  Except that she nursed her kicked wrist she seemed to have forgotten the
  incident. Wu Tu, also nursing a wrist, backed away until she reached the
  wall; then she called to the Chinese girl, who came and stood beside her.</p>

  <p>"Please shoot us both!" said Wu Tu.</p>

  <p>"Please shoot!" she repeated.</p>

  <p>Blair had no doubt what to do, but he was struggling with an almost
  hysterical impulse to laugh. He took both pistols in his left hand because
  Henrietta took his right hand and.used her frock to stanch the blood where
  the Chinese girl had torn and bitten it. It was bleeding badly. There was
  blood on the girl's face and she kept wiping her lips with the back of her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Any more hidden weapons?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"No," said Wu Tu.</p>

  <p>Henrietta tore a long strip from her frock that had been ripped in the
  struggle, and began to bandage his right hand.</p>

  <p>"Come here and be searched," he commanded.</p>

  <p>"No," said Wu Tu. "Shoot me."</p>

  <p>"That's bravado, old lady. You know damned well I won't shoot."</p>

  <p>"I would have shot you," she retorted. "They are poisoned bullets. You
  would have died if one had touched you."</p>

  <p>He grinned at the pain in his right hand. Henrietta bandaged it
  carefully.</p>

  <p>"Finished? Good. We're in for trouble now, so stand by!" He eyed Wu Tu
  again, emptied both automatics and pocketed the cartridges.</p>

  <p>"Strip off that sari and throw it to me!" he commanded.</p>

  <p>The answer was suddenly passionate: "No! Don't you dare to shoot? Are you
  too big a coward?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered. "But I don't mind kicking you unconscious! D'you hear
  me?"</p>

  <p>Wu Tu heard and evidently understood, but hesitated. Suddenly she began to
  plead:</p>

  <p>"Blair, shoot me! You can say that Zaman Ali, or Taron Ling or someone did
  it! I can't go to prison, Blair. I can't! I won't! If I can't have this
  secret, life's finished, for me. Lots of people will be grateful to you if
  you shoot me&mdash;all those who owe me money&mdash;all the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He took one step toward her. At that she pulled off the sari, bundled it
  and flung it on the floor between them, sneering:</p>

  <p>"You swine!"</p>

  <p>Henrietta laughed: "You little thief, Wu Tu! That's my underwear that you
  have on!"</p>

  <p>"Pick up her sari, please," said Blair. "Tear it into good long
  strips."</p>

  <p>Henrietta obeyed. She had to use her teeth to get the rending started.</p>

  <p>"Now hold both pistols and keep cool. I may have to be a bit rough."</p>

  <p>Blair took the long silken strips and walked toward Wu Tu, smiling.
  "Better take your medicine, old lady. I don't want to hurt you, but I will if
  I must. Turn your face to the wall and put your hands behind you." He was
  wondering just how hard to hit if she resisted, and what the effect of the
  blow would be on Henrietta. He did not care in the least about Wu Tu's
  feelings. He was rather surprised when she obeyed him and faced the
  wall&mdash;not quite agreeably surprised, because obedience might mean that
  she could still command unguessable resources.</p>

  <p>So he tied her wrists cunningly. Then, when he had helped her to the
  chair, he tied her ankles, and tied her into the chair, watched all the time
  by the Chinese girl as if he were a conjurer showing her some new trick.</p>

  <p>"No need to gag you," he said. "I'll bring you water by and by."</p>

  <p>Then, maliciously: "Shout for help if Taron Ling annoys you."</p>

  <p>After that he tied the Chinese girl hand and foot, apologizing because he
  could not leave her a hand free to smoke cigarettes. She offered no
  resistance, made no answer, lay at Wu Tu's feet and looked up at her without
  any apparent emotion.</p>

  <p>"You are no gentleman," said Wu Tu. "If you were, you would shoot."</p>

  <p>She repeated the remark to Henrietta:</p>

  <p>"Remember, I have warned you&mdash;he is not a gentleman!"</p>

  <p>Blair's interest in Wu Tu's judgment on that point amounted to less than a
  shrug of the shoulders, but he wondered why she said it.</p>

  <p>There was probably a motive.</p>

  <p>It was growing so dark that he had to take the electric torch to examine
  the knots he had tied. The bandaged right hand had made him a bit clumsy.
  However, the knots looked good. He turned the torch on Henrietta&mdash;
  framed her in a pool of light, her white skin glowing through the torn frock.
  His eyes appraised, enjoyed, approved. Then, suddenly:</p>

  <p>"Where's Frensham?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>All the answer Henrietta made was to put on her sandals and lead the way
  out.</p>

  unto eternity. And of eternity, where is the end?</p>

  <p class="quote">&mdash;From the Ninth (unfinished) Book of Noor Ali.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT WAS not yet sunset; the sky showed through the. gap in
  the roof. But the great pit was filled with gloom in which the cone-shaped
  sepulchre of Her of Gaglajung stood vaguely luminous. It seemed to stand on
  nothing, because of the darkness of the mound beneath it. The echoed gurgle
  and splash of water emphasized the stillness. Bats were awake; in thousands,
  like black particles in a whirlpool, they streamed in an ascending spiral
  toward the opening far overhead. Blair was almost out on his feet, from lack
  of sleep and physical exhaustion. The maddeningly mystic gloaming made his
  senses reel.</p>

  <p>He followed Henrietta slowly, fighting an almost overwhelming impulse to
  let everything go to hell and just make love to her. Habitual
  self-discipline&mdash;that, and the lingering suspicion of Wu Tu's methods,
  that might have unbalanced him more than enough to make him act
  unwisely&mdash;forced him to concentrate effort on getting and feeling
  control of himself. He did that savagely, not overtaking Henrietta until she
  waited for him, in a hollow between two walls of waxy stalagmite, where the
  shadow lay deep. Her first words shocked him:</p>

  <p>"There will be a full moon."</p>

  <p>What the hell had that to do with it? He was not there to talk about
  moonshine! The new-born sense of intimacy, sudden and delicious, that for the
  first time in his life had withdrawn the veil between him and any woman,
  produced a characteristic reaction. He was a trained and trusted public
  servant, whose personal delights came last, not first.</p>

  <p>"Where is your father?" he demanded in a quiet voice, cautious not to stir
  too many echoes. "Don't forget I came here looking for him."</p>

  <p>"Please, Blair, you must wait for moonlight."</p>

  <p>He turned the torchlight on her. Her hand trembled as she laid the empty
  automatics on a fold of the rock. But she was less tired than he was.
  Stockingless, lithe, athletic, in a torn frock that revealed most of one
  thigh, she looked gorgeous&mdash;like a Sabine woman, plundered and all the
  more precious for that.</p>

  <p>He strode nearer and she recognized the unsecret, possessive, and
  strong-willed light that glowed from his eyes. No word passed between them.
  He switched o(T the torchlight, took her in his arms, kissed and crushed her
  , breathless.</p>

  <p>There was no India, no job, nothing for a while except they
  two&mdash;until the night shut down solidly black, and away up near the ,
  summit of Gaglajung the Pleiades, like jewels, twinkled through, the gap.</p>

  <p>"No more secrets," he said then.</p>

  <p>"No more secrets!" said an echo. Every spoken word produced a hollow
  murmur, but some words came back unexpectedly in an exaggerated whisper.</p>

  <p>"No. Blair, from the day I first loved you, I never wanted to keep a
  secret from you."</p>

  <p>The policeman, that was the other half of Blair Warrender, resumed
  authority, suddenly, because that was his way.</p>

  <p>"And your father is where?" he asked her.</p>

  <p>"Where?" said the echo. "Where? Where?"</p>

  <p>She nestled closer, and laughed delightedly because she understood him. It
  was true they could have no secret from each other. That was his abrupt way
  of accepting intimacy, genuine and forever. But the echoes also laughed. They
  were derisive. She lowered her voice.</p>

  <p>"Blair, dear, please wait for the moon. Don't you&mdash;won't you
  understand I couldn't tell you simply and solely because I couldn't?"</p>

  <p>"You could have tried," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Blair, if you only knew, you wouldn't say that. While you didn't love me,
  but I did love you, there was one thing I couldn't even try to do. Would you
  try, now, to make me despise you? If I had tried, you would have thought me
  quite mad. Even if you hadn't said so, I would have known what you thought,
  and I couldn't have endured that. It was better you should think me venomous,
  or criminal&mdash;oh, anything was better. It isn't as if I could have made
  you believe. I couldn't.. If you hadn't come here, you would never have seen
  me again. You would never have known the secret; or I think not."</p>

  <p>That startled him. He spoke louder. "Do you mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean?" an echo whispered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, I would not have killed myself. There was no need. You will
  understand that presently. But you would never have seen me again."</p>

  <p>"Wu Tu would have killed you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. Wu Tu wants to learn the secret from me. If she has learned it,
  then it would have been too late to kill me."</p>

  <p>"I'm being awfully patient, sweetheart."</p>

  <p>"I know it. You will soon understand. You will see my difficulty. Father
  discovered this placed Do you know what his passionate interests were?"</p>

  <p>"Passionate interests!" said an echo. It was like a mocking
  commentary.</p>

  <p>"More or less. Fourth dimension&mdash;ancient magic&mdash;showers of fish
  in deserts&mdash;sudden appearance of plants and animals on desert
  islands&mdash;Charles Fort's books&mdash;disappearance without trace of about
  a hundred thousand people every
  year&mdash;telepathy&mdash;clairvoyance&mdash;pretty" nearly everything a
  soldier shouldn't care a damn about."</p>

  <p>"True, he should not have been a soldier."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Where is he? Where is he?" an echo whispered. "Wait, dear, for
  moonlight."</p>

  <p>"Do you know a way out of these caverns?"</p>

  <p>"No. And when Chetusingh brought me, I didn't care. It was good-by
  forever."</p>

  <p>"But you care now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You know it. We'll find a way out."</p>

  <p>"Let's hope Chetusingh will, somehow. He has gone for help. Better hurry
  if you want to show me secrets. Is your father dead?"</p>

  <p>"Wait, Blair&mdash;please wait. I'm doing my best. Wu Tu's obsession is to
  do what he did&mdash; and return and be wiser than anyone else in the world.
  Wu Tu knows the legends. She believes what very few people gave father credit
  for, that he really knew what he was doing. He investigated ancient legends
  about so-called lost races of giants, that once peopled the world but
  vanished before history, as we know it, began to be written. He wondered why
  and how they vanished.</p>

  <p>"He was quite familiar with the writings of Einstein, Jeans, Eddington,
  Whately Smith, Haldane and men like that. Mathematics was like music to him;
  he could think in terms of mathematics. It was one of his favorite sayings
  that matter is nothing but theoretical dimensions in motion. He believed
  there is truth underlying the legend about how the Atlanteans, whoever they
  were, destroyed themselves and vanished, from misuse of too much knowledge.
  Can you imagine then what it meant to him when he discovered this place? And
  that priestess! Is she not plainly a hierophant? Doesn't she guard, yet tell
  in silence, some tremendous secret that the ancients knew? Would he tell
  about this place? Would he have it plundered like Tut-ank-ahmen's tomb? Would
  he have tourists let in?"</p>

  <p>From where they sat on the rock, with her head on his shoulder, he could
  look straight up through the opening to the sky. He stared at the Pleiades.
  Then he glanced at the cone, ghostly luminous, that seemed able to steal and
  concentrate the starlight, like a tiger's eyes in darkness. "I can understand
  his keeping it secret," he answered. "But you?"</p>

  <p>"I can't remember the time when he and I weren't friends. He told me
  everything except about Wu Tu. I couldn't help him much about this, but I did
  what I could. You see, I don't understand mathematics. Symbology seems as
  difficult to me as Chinese. There were thin metal plates, that he found by
  opening a gold box. He had to smash the box to open it. The gold was as hard
  as iron, so the plates got damaged. I helped to photograph them and the
  photography revealed marks which father concluded were mathematical symbols,
  dealing with the fourth dimension. He and I came back for the other boxes,
  which he had left here because it seemed the safest place to leave them. But
  by that time Wu Tu's agents had terrorized the Bat-Brahmin and found their
  way in. They took the boxes. I suppose they melted them.</p>

  <p>"Father nearly went frantic with disappointment. He almost decided to fell
  the government about it there and then, to, prevent further looting. But it
  wouldn't have looked well, would it? He had kept it secret so long and he
  himself had taken three boxes, and smashed one. The mildest thing the
  government would be likely to do would be to transfer him and completely
  close the place, on the ground of religious prejudice. If they did admit
  anyone, it would be some orthodox expert, who would measure everything and
  understand nothing. You know the kind of man I mean&mdash;one of those mild,
  safe, unimaginative scientists&mdash;the kind of man who says the Great
  Pyramid of Egypt is a tomb built by Cheops.</p>

  <p>"It seemed better to run risks&mdash;take consequences, whatever they
  might be. It was obvious that the Woman within that cone had been immured,
  perhaps hundreds of thousands of years ago, by people who knew how to make
  liquid stone take shape and solidify and become transparent. Also they knew
  how to harden gold, and how to close up a gold box without leaving a seam. So
  they probably knew a great deal more than that. Blair, did you ever imagine
  the fourth dimension?"</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "Three give me trouble enough!"</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine a fourth. But I know the theory. Something like, this:
  One dimension is a straight line, without breadth or depth. If you move that
  at right angles to itself you get a place of two dimensions, don't you? You
  get three dimensions&mdash;that is to say a cube&mdash;if you move the, plane
  at right angles to itself. It has depth then, as well as length and breadth.
  An inhabitant of a two-dimensional plane, supposing there were one, couldn't
  see or understand three dimensions. The two-dimensional person couldn't see
  the depth, could he? He'd be unconscious of it. Anything lifted off his plane
  in the direction of the third dimension would go out of his consciousness. He
  would call that, magic, because he couldn't explain it. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Go on. I'm listening."</p>

  <p>"To arrive at the fourth dimension one must now try to imagine the cube
  moved at right angles to itself. We three-dimensional people find that
  difficult. Most of us can't imagine it at all, but mathematicians understand
  the theory, and they know what some of the properties of the fourth dimension
  are. The point is, that if anything were tilted, or in some way removed into
  the fourth dimension, we three dimensional people would no longer be
  conscious of it. It would look like magic, wouldn't it? Well&mdash;you have
  heard of the ancient rope trick?"</p>

  <p>"Never met a man who saw it done." Blair answered. But he glanced at the
  cone in the midst of the pit, loaded and aglow with starlight. The word
  impossible died on his lips.</p>

  <p>"Father saw it&mdash;twice," said Henrietta. "He photographed it both
  times. A man threw a rope in the air. climbed the rope, disappeared, and
  pulled the rope after him. It was the same man each time. The photographs
  showed the man climbing."</p>

  <p>"Where are the photographs?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhere in the Secret Service files. Father came to the conclusion that
  the man merely moved away into the fourth dimension&mdash; that he knew how
  to do that, and to return at will&mdash;or perhaps he couldn't help
  returning. Father developed a theory that perhaps a small percentage of the
  hundred thousand or more people who disappear unaccountably every year, have
  slipped or stumbled off into the fourth dimension by accident. It is a theory
  that can't be disproved, no matter who ridicules it. And by reversing it, one
  arrives at another theory, equally impossible to disprove; that
  vegetation&mdash;insects&mdash;animals &mdash;even human beings, when
  conditions are right, are sometimes perhaps expelled from the fourth
  dimension into our three-dimensional existence, by what Charles Fort called
  teleportation. The theory offers a not impossible explanation for all sorts
  of phenomena that can't be explained otherwise."</p>

  <p>"Dreams, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"Some dreams, not all. Some sorts of visions, too, that have been seen by
  people whose veracity isn't in doubt. People on battlefields see visions.
  There were the Angels of Lyons. Lots of people see, at times, into the fourth
  dimension. Very religious people sometimes do it. There must be a point or a
  plane at which dimensions merge or meet or extend into one another. According
  to father's theory, light, which nobody really understands, has something to
  do with it.</p>

  <p>"He made experiments, here, in this cavern, bearing in mind the legends,
  and wondering why there are no graves and only that one giantess immured in
  stone. There are skeletons in the crypt, it's true, where Ranjeet's queen
  burned herself and her woman to death; and there are a lew in the tunnel, but
  those are obviously modern; the Bat-Brahmin admits they are those of people
  who got in, and were sent in and never got out again.</p>

  <p>"Ever since Ranjeet's queen cremated herself, if she did, and the heat
  cracked the sealed wall of the crypt, the Bat-Brahmins have known of these
  caverns. People who were too persistently inquisitive were admitted, and shut
  in, to die of hunger or by falling into holes in the dark. That is how the
  secret has been kept. But father noticed there are no ancient skeletons,
  although the legend is that a whole race perished in here."</p>

  <p>"Perished in here!" said an echo.</p>

  <p>Blair glanced again at the opening, high up, inaccessible, through which
  the Pleiades were twinkling now less brightly in the light of the rising
  moon. He shuddered but reserved comment, hoping Chetusingh would solve the
  problem of escape from the caverns. Wu Tu had said she knew no way out.</p>

  <p>"Father decided," Henrietta went on, "that perhaps those ancients used
  this cavern as a means of escape into the fourth dimension. Perhaps they
  didn't like to die. Perhaps they saw there is no need to die. Perhaps that
  giantess was somebody who died before her time; she may have been immured, as
  she stands, as a warning or something like that. Or perhaps she was
  deliberately killed and set there as a monument to symbolize something or
  other; for instance, 'naked we came into the world, naked we leave it.' He
  thought of that. It was no use dismissing a thought unexamined; he had to use
  his imagination if he was to find out anything at all."</p>

  <p>"Did he discuss all this with you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I wasn't with him when he stumbled on the right solution. He was
  in here on a night of full moon, and he had with him a servant who, I think,
  was one of Wu Tu's spies, although the man pretended to be deaf and dumb: I
  always thought he was pretending, but father thought not; that was why he
  chose him. He and the servant went where I will take you presently. The
  deaf-and-dumb man&mdash;he was a Bombay boy&mdash;had hurt himself rather
  badly. He was only wearing a loin-cloth because of the heat; father always
  carried a pocket first-aid kit, with iodine and that kind of thing. He signed
  to him to take off his loin-cloth and show the injury. The servant obeyed. He
  vanished&mdash;instantly."</p>

  <p>"You mean into the fourth dimension?"</p>

  <p>"That was father's theory. He could imagine no other."</p>

  <p>"Did he report the disappearance?"</p>

  <p>"No. Who would have believed it? Wu Tu &mdash;I am sure it was
  she&mdash;introduced him to a woman who was in her service. I did not meet.
  her, but I knew about her. I believe the woman drugged him. I can't prove it,
  but I believe he used to tell her all he knew. Anyhow, Wu Tu learned what had
  happened to the deaf-and-dumb man, and from that time there was no shaking
  her off. She threatened to have father accused of murder unless he would take
  her into partnership and tell her all he knew. She threatened to have him
  accused of looting the caverns."</p>

  <p>"Why don't blackmailed people come to the police?" Blair wondered. "What a
  damned fool!"</p>

  <p>"Was he? I don't think he cared for the blackmail at all. He made no
  bargain with Wu Tu; He knew she would not dare to accuse him, because it was
  she and her agents who had looted the gold. What he decided to do was to come
  back and look for the servant, even if he had to follow him into the fourth
  dimension."</p>

  <p>"Did he think he could bring him back?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't know."</p>

  <p>"And you agreed?"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't asked. He went and did it. What would have been the use of my
  telling you, for instance, what I thought had happened? Would you have
  believed me? You believe me now. But would you have believed me then?"</p>

  <p>"If you weren't consulted, how do you know what he did?"</p>

  <p>"I will show you presently. But I should have been very stupid not to
  guess what, he had done. He left a note for me saying where he was going, and
  reminding me that he had already conveyed his property to me by deed of
  trust. He asked me to burn the note and say nothing. L did. We had often
  talked over what it might mean to step off into the fourth dimension, and
  perhaps meet each other there.</p>

  <p>"Neither of us ever had the least doubt of a life after death. But we
  agreed in not liking the prospect of death, it's such a messy and sometimes
  such a cruel business. I like life. I love it. But the thought of life in
  love with you. and you indifferent, was such a drab, unlovely prospect that I
  made up my mind to follow father if I could get into the caverns. I had been
  unable to get in lately. So when Chetusingh brought me a message, that I
  thought couldn't possibly be from you, I pretended to believe, and I came
  like a shot,"</p>

  <p>"Like a shot!" said a whispering echo.</p>

  <p>"Wu Tu wants to follow him?"</p>

  <p>"I think she wants to look into the fourth dimension. Wu Tu craves power.
  She believes she can learn black magic. She believes in it, and I believe
  she's afraid of it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, she does, and she is." said Blair. "Well, she's afraid of prison.
  She's afraid of death. She'll learn all about both, if we ever gel out of
  here alive. She'll have to swing tor killing Zaman Ali&mdash;not. that he
  didn't deserve it. I feel sorry for her. But when a woman like Wu Tu slips
  up, she has too many debtors and rivals and other sorts of deadly enemies to
  have a chance to escape the gallows. I know many a worse blackguard than Wu
  Tu who won't get hanged, but who will laugh with relief when it happens to
  her."</p>

  <p>"You're not vindictive?"</p>

  <p>"No. Vindictive people are all contemptible, and most of them are
  self-righteous swine. Wu Tu is about the opposite of my idea of a desirable,
  but if I could. I'd save her for the sake of what she has taught me, about
  crooks and half a hundred other things.".</p>

  <p>"Look!" said Henrietta.</p>

  <p>The rind of the moon rose golden in the gap, and the Pleiades vanished.
  The entire cavern became filled with dim light: but the great cone glittered
  in the midst as if cold fire burned within. The woman remained invisible, but
  there were swirling shapes, like opal clouds, inside the cone. They changed
  each second, with each fractional change of the moon's height.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" said Henrietta.</p>

  <p>"Wait! Wait!" echoes whispered.</p>

  <p>They stood up, hand in hand. Second by second the cone grew brighter,
  until its summit glowed like molten silver&mdash;changing&mdash;
  changing&mdash;the glow descending. Slowly, as the full moon stole upward
  past the brim of the gap, the entire cone grew suddenly silver&mdash;and then
  suddenly transparent. The silver vanished. It gleamed pure crystal. The
  giantess stared forth like a splendid statue, dead and yet strangely
  lifelike.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Henrietta.</p>

  <p>"Come!" an echo whispered in Blair's ear. But he stared and stood still.
  It was nearly a minute before he yielded to the tug of Henrietta's hand and
  followed her. Even the echoes of their footsteps were like sounds in a
  dream.</p>

  <p>There was no longer need for the electric torch. Moonlight filled the
  cavern: the cone diffused it, conquering all shadows except in the segment
  behind the mound: even there it was not totally dark. Henrietta led into the
  shadow until the cone stood straight between them and the moon, and they
  could see the Woman, weirdly radiant. She looked alive, in motion, walking
  forward; tired eyes refused to believe she was not moving. From beneath, at
  that angle, she seemed to be staring upward at the ledge that surrounded the
  pit.</p>

  <p>At the rear of the mound, illuminated dimly by the all-pervading glow, a
  flight of wide stone steps ascended fifty or sixty feet to a narrow
  egg-shaped opening. Steps and opening were probably invisible from the ledge:
  they curved on the face of the mound and were flanked by a natural balustrade
  of cream-hued stalagmite, worn soap-smooth where ancient hands, ascending and
  descending, had pressed on its upper surface. They were irregular steps: no
  two were alike: several of them were three feet higher than the step below.
  It was a stairway for a giant, worn on the surface by ages of use.</p>

  <p>They ascended together, laboring up hand-in-hand, until they stood
  exhausted before the egg-shaped opening. Its small end was downward, and
  around its edge were vaguely snake-like tracings on the stone. Within was
  darkness. Blair switched on the torch. They ascended a smooth-walled passage,
  ten feet high, four feet wide, that spiraled gradually upward, worn along its
  midst into a shallow trough by feet that must always have marched in Indian
  file.</p>

  <p>They could hardly hear themselves speak, hardly hear their own footfall;
  the sounds they made seemed to travel along in front of them, so that the
  sensation was of following other people into the home of all the booming
  noises in the world.</p>

  <p>It was a long climb; the passage apparently made two complete ascending
  spirals within the mound. But at last there began to be light &mdash;so much
  light that the torch was no longer needed. They came to another egg-shaped
  opening in a weirdly carved wall. Through that the light shone from an
  enormous chamber that except for two thirds of the floor contained not one
  flat surface. Its curved walls seemed to be built of frozen moonlight. There
  was nothing else to which to compare it.</p>

  <p>"It is only like this in full moonlight," Henrietta whispered. "When the
  sun shines nothing can live in this place." Even a whisper sighed like wind
  until its echo flowed back past them and down the tunnel.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the place, arranged in an elongated oval, there were
  eighteen crystalline, apparently unhewn, natural columns. They supported the
  roof and surrounded an oval hollow that suggested a pool, but there was no
  water in it. Its floor looked like molten metal in the light that streamed
  through the roof, between the columns. The mirror-like surface of the pool
  caught, suffused and spread the light outward between the columns toward the
  concave surface of the chamber wall, which reflected it back, confused but
  soft and tolerable. The shadowy reflections of the columns seemed to swim
  within the wall, in fantastic and innumerable curves that changed their shape
  as the observer moved.</p>

  <p>Sensation reeled. The slowly moving moonlight pouring through the gap on
  the summit of Gaglajung touched millions of microscopic prisms in the cone
  that contained the Woman. The light came through the cone into the chamber,
  magnified and broken into soundless, formless, spastic symphonies of chaos.
  The place swam in motion. Even the columns seemed to move, in an
  incomprehensible, measureless dance, like reeds in a whirlwind. But the air
  was stifling; there seemed to be no draught whatever, and that increased the
  weirdness.</p>

  <p>Up between and above the columns, seen through stone as clear as crystal,
  like an undead corpse in water moved by multitudes of currents, stood the
  Woman of Gaglajung: By some freak in the shape of the crystalline stone, she
  appeared now to be staring downward at her own reflection. It felt like
  looking up through deep, clear water at an unearthly bather&mdash;monstrous,
  meditative, silent. When they stood still and made no echoes, there was such
  silence that Blair's straining ears heard his own and Henrietta's
  heartbeats.</p>

  <p>Moment after moment the light increased. The oval hole through which they
  had entered was not at the chamber's wider end but about fifteen feet to one
  side of it. At the narrower, far end of the chamber, on the floor, against
  the wall, confusingly reflected amid tangled images of columns on the wall's
  curved surface, there was something not quite recognizable and yet familiar
  that caught Blair's eye. He walked toward it, treading as quietly as he could
  because his footsteps filled the place with noise as weirdly broken and
  confusing as the light.</p>

  <p>Henrietta shook off her sandals and followed, but even bare feet stirred a
  whispering, like wind amid reeds. They passed between the columns, skirting
  the curved surface of the egg-shaped pool. It had been swept; the dust of
  ages lay in a heap between two columns, except for a small oval space in the
  center.</p>

  <p>Seen close, that looked like polished, aluminum. But the part in the
  center, about six or seven feet long, defied imagination. It appeared to be
  neither solid nor liquid. It looked like a pool of pure moonlight. It was
  very difficult to look at steadily, 'but reflected within it, reversed,
  reduced in size and gazing upward, was the Woman. There was nothing else
  reflected in that central portion. Blair made a move to examine it more
  closely.</p>

  <p>"Don't!" Henrietta exclaimed&mdash;instant&mdash;sudden&mdash; clutching
  his arm. Her exclamation filled the place with rolling thunder. Blair saw the
  fear in her eyes. He sensed no danger, but saw that she did, so he took her
  hand and continued his way to the wall at the far end. The light, continually
  more confusing, changed every second. They were close to the
  wall&mdash;within six strides of it&mdash;before he saw that the curious
  object was some clothing.</p>

  <p>It was a coat, folded with military neatness, topped by a two-decker Terai
  hat of thin gray felt, such as Frensham always wore,when not in uniform.
  Slightly protruding from the jacket pocket was a flat metal first-aid
  kit-box. Beside the hat there was an empty cigarette case of thin, polished
  wood, a box of matches and a felt-covered water-bottle with a fitted metal
  cup. Beside those was a bit of black candle-wick amid the shapeless residue
  of a burned-out candle. Three dead matches and three closely burned cigarette
  ends lay in a neat little heap together, near the wall.</p>

  <p>"He must have sat here smoking, waiting for the moon," Henrietta
  whispered. "It was at full moon that the deaf-and-dumb man vanished."</p>

  <p>"Vanished&mdash;vanished!&mdash;" said the echo and went whispering down
  the tunnel&mdash;"Vanished &mdash;vanished!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Blair searched the jacket. There was nothing in the pockets. He stared at
  Henrietta&mdash;refolded the jacket:</p>

  <p>"Why the devil did he take his clothes off?"</p>

  <p>"The deaf-and-dumb man did," she answered. "And he found it&mdash;the
  fourth dimension. He disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Disappeared&mdash;disappeared&mdash;" said the echo. Blair glanced
  upward, but from that end of the chamber the giantess was invisible.</p>

  <p>Henrietta whispered again:</p>

  <p>"Father made experiments, remember."</p>

  <p>She moved the coat and the other things, signed to him, and they sat where
  it had been, side by side, with their backs to the wall, heads touching,
  clasped in each other's arms. A line drawn then between them would "have
  passed exactly down the center of the place between the columns and across
  the pool, to the middle of the broad end of the chamber. The oval opening by
  which they came in was on their left-front, hidden from them by the
  columns.</p>

  <p>The light kept growing stronger every second, and yet curiously soft:
  there was no perceptible strain on the eyes, although there was a feeling of
  confusion. Attention wandered. It was like staring in a dream at fascinating
  and convincing unreality. There appeared an exceedingly thin line, like a
  plane of light seen edgewise between the pool and the roof&mdash;almost like
  one filament of the Aurora Borealis. When Blair moved his head it
  vanished.</p>

  <p>When he resumed his position it reappeared. It refused to be placed. It
  was there and not there, but it seemed to pass upward, through the
  transparent roof toward the Woman. It shone, but it was less like a ray of
  light than like one of those slanting rays that Cubists paint, to lead
  imagination toward new frontiers of realism. It moved, but there was no
  describing its movements: its soundlessness suggested sound turned inside
  out, rather than silence.</p>

  <p>Henrietta whispered excitedly: "Do what he did!"</p>

  <p>Abruptly, she slipped off her clothes. Even so. Blair hesitated.
  Convention dies harder in a man. But Henrietta seemed perfectly
  unself-conscious. Chin on knees, she stared straight at the dreamlike line
  between the columns, not turning her head when she spoke again,
  low-voiced:</p>

  <p>"I don't know why&mdash;perhaps nobody can know why&mdash;this only
  happens in full moonlight. You can't see unless you're naked. Why, I don't
  know. But you'll have to resist. You must hang on."</p>

  <p>What she saw, he could not see. But he could feel the tenseness with which
  she set herself against almost irresistible force that he, could not feel.
  His jacket sleeve brushed her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Blair, don't Please don't! The least touch of clothing stops it!"</p>

  <p>Her rapt expression instantly returned.</p>

  <p>"Look! Look!"</p>

  <p>"Look! Look!&mdash;" echoes shouted down the tunnel.</p>

  <p>"What do you see?"</p>

  <p>"What don't I see! I can't tell you! I suppose it's four dimensions! It's
  the next world! it's indescribable! When the moon goes beyond the gap?"</p>

  <p>"Blair, come with me!" The mere touch of his sleeve on her shoulder
  brought her back to a world of three dimensions. She looked into his eyes.
  Hers pleaded. "Blair dear, do look! Then we'll both go, or we'll both
  stay!"</p>

  <p>"Go where?"</p>

  <p>"Through that! Into eternity! I want you to see it! Then choose. I won't
  go unless you come with me."</p>

  <p>The din was a tremendous tempest of sound &mdash;weird and unintelligible
  voices filled the chamber: some seemed human, but they used no words that
  Blair knew. For a moment he thought he was hearing instead of seeing four
  dimensions. Henrietta was in better possession of her senses than he was;
  even in that state of emotion sounds did not deceive her for a second. She
  spoke excitedly:</p>

  <p>"Someone's coming! Blair, there are only moments left! I won't go without
  you, but look&mdash;look! See! Quick, while there's moon-light!"</p>

  <p>Blair seized the electric torch as if it were a pistol and moved his head
  to see between the columns.</p>

  <p>Wu Tu stood there.</p>

  <p>Tragically, in a hurricane of noise, she stumbled, exhausted, toward the
  broad end of the chamber. There she stood staring between the columns, with
  the Chinese girl behind her. The Chinese girl was picking her front teeth
  with finger and thumb: she had evidently used them to worry loose the knots
  on Wu Tu's wrists.</p>

  <p>She looked young again with soft, confused light blending and re-blending
  on her ivory skin. Her eyes shone in that light. She said one word in Chinese
  and walked straight forward. But the Chinese girl stood still and continued
  to pick her teeth with her back to the wall.</p>

  <p>Henrietta's whispering voice was lost in din that thundered from the
  passage. It exploded. It suggested heavy footsteps magnified and multiplied
  by echoes. Chetusingh on the way with assistance&mdash;</p>

  <p>Blair groped for Henrietta's frock and threw it over her. Wu Tu's eyes
  seemed fixed on infinity. She stepped straight down into the hollow between
  the columns. There she raised her arms, smiled upward through the pouring
  light toward the Woman above her. She dropped her sari on the ground,
  and&mdash;like a bather entering water&mdash;touched with her toe the
  central, egg-shaped place that looked like pure light. Eyes could not follow
  what happened then. She laughed. Instantly, where she had stood there was
  nothing. Like a vanished shadow, she was not there. Her laugh survived her.
  It reverberated through the chamber until the roar from the passage drowned
  it.</p>

  <p>Then, before bewilderment had time to slacken its grip on imagination, the
  moon's rim passed beyond the gap on the shoulder o Gaglajung. The light
  waned as if turned down by someone unseen. Second by second, dim gray
  luminescence faded into darkness, soot-black, until Blair could not even see
  the outline of Henrietta's face. But the din grew greater; it was like the
  tramp of an invading host in ammunition boots. Henrietta was speaking, but he
  could not distinguish what she said.</p>

  <p>He was listening for the Chinese girl; she might be on the prowl in the
  dark, and he did not want to be murdered. Henrietta leaned on his shoulder to
  shout in his ear. Then the din ceased suddenly, as if a lid had shut tight,
  although the echoes mumbled away down the tunnel. Stifling heat and darkness
  blended into silence that bred terror, until a loud, gruff voice
  demanded:</p>

  <p>"Blair&mdash;where are you?"</p>

  <p>"Are you&mdash;are you&mdash;are you&mdash;?" asked the echoes.</p>

  <p>Three lights&mdash;an electric torch and two lanterns&mdash;suddenly shone
  in the entrance. They were not reflected by columns and walls as the
  moonlight had been. They were merely bright lights in darkness.</p>

  <p>"Where are you, Blair?"</p>

  <p>He kept the advantage of darkness, gripping his own torch. "Here, with
  Henrietta Frensham. Who are you?" he answered.</p>

  <p>There was a gruff laugh. The lights came forward. One&mdash;a screened
  lantern&mdash;turned and moved toward the far wall until it framed the
  Chinese girl like a cameo. She was still picking her front teeth. Blair
  flashed on his own torch then and light met light in glare through which it
  was impossible to see. He had an arm around Henrietta, with his back to the
  wall. She saw better than he did, because of the angle of light.</p>

  <p>"You?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Then Blair saw. "You sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" said the commissioner. "Where did you suppose I was?" He had a
  secret service man beside him&mdash;numbered anonymity, who moved like a
  shadow. "Where is Wu Tu?"</p>

  <p>He was standing on the spot where Wu Tu had vanished.</p>

  <p>"Damned if I know," Blair answered and the echoes multiplied his words
  into a roar' like mocking laughter.</p>

  <p>"Tell him!" urged Henrietta. The echoes tossed her words from wall to wall
  until the darkness shouted: "Tell him! Tell him!"</p>

  <p>The commissioner came closer&mdash;spoke in a lower voice: "Where's
  Frensham?"</p>

  <p>Blair turned his torch on the heap of clothing. The commissioner stooped
  and examined it:</p>

  <p>"That all? Dead? Then where's his body?"</p>

  <p>"Damned if I know." Blair spoke to Henrietta: "He said, in Bombay, you're
  his god-child, so he believes what you say. You tell him!"</p>

  <p>"Tell him!" the echoes cannonaded, until they died away in a whisper clown
  the tunnel. "Tell him&mdash;tell him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wu Tu went out of the world," said Henrietta. "You can see her sari; and
  here are father's clothes. They saw into another world and walked straight
  in."</p>

  <p>The commissioner said nothing.</p>

  <p>She continued: "The ancients, who set the Woman where she stands, went
  that way. Blair and I saw it. I saw what Wu Tu saw. Blair didn't."</p>

  <p>The commissioner stroked his stubbled chin.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "Blair wouldn't." He faced Blair. "Stick to that. You hear
  me? We can't have a tale like this told: India'd be a madhouse."</p>

  <p>"How could one tell? What could one say?" asked Henrietta. "Now you know
  why I told nothing."</p>

  <p>"There's been fighting, one can say that," the commissioner answered. "I
  passed Taron Ling's, Zaman Ali's and two other bodies. Chetusingh says all
  Zaman Ali's men are dead. That shuts their mouths. Frensham died by accident;
  we've found his clothes, so that's that. Who killed Wu Tu?"</p>

  <p>Blair laughed. "You did!"</p>

  <p>"You did&mdash;you did&mdash;!" said the echoes.</p>

  <p>"I did&mdash;! followed and tried to overtake her. Kill her? What the hell
  do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"You made a noise like the end of the world," Blair answered. "It scared
  her into the next one. She walked straight ahead into it to escape you!"</p>

  <p>"Can she come back? That's the problem!" The commissioner stroked his chin
  again.</p>

  <p>"Well, if she does, she'll wish she hadn't. She and Frensham are missing.
  I shall certify them dead on circumstantial evidence. You and I entered a
  cavern and found articles of their clothing. Stick to that. You understand
  me? Silence, barring a full report for File FF; you write and initial that;
  I'll sign it. The Bat-Brahmin won't talk. Who else might?"</p>

  <p>He turned his searchlight on the Chinese girl. At the far end of the
  chamber, in a pool of lantern light, she smiled serenely with her back to the
  wall. She was chewing something. Chetusingh was whispering to her.</p>

  <p>Blair felt the pain in his bandaged hand.</p>

  <p>"Bite, yes." he said. "Talk, no. But she's good with a dagger. Barring
  luck, she'd have killed me three times over."</p>

  <p>The commissioner's face was invisible in the dark, but his grin could be
  felt, heard; it was part of his voice: "Think so? She'd have had to answer to
  Chetusingh. He owns her. He'd kill her if she killed you. He swears you're
  the only officer he cares to work with, because he knows what you'll do. He
  and that girl between them substituted alcohol for Wu Tu's special drug. Did
  she stick you with it?"</p>

  <p>Blair bridled. He spoke abruptly: "Why wasn't I told? "</p>

  <p>"Told&mdash;told&mdash;told&mdash;" the echoes rumbled back and forth. The
  commissioner lowered his voice:</p>

  <p>"It you'd entirely trusted Chetusingh you'd have shown it and aroused Wu
  Tu's suspicion. Chetusingh agreed with me, there was no way to worm this
  secret out of Henrietta but by using you and letting Wu Tu force the issue.
  We were hard on your heels."</p>

  <p>The shadowy anonymity, with Wu Tu's sari on his arm. came and gathered up
  Frensham's effects by the light of the commissioner's torch. He had left his
  lantern in the entrance: With his arms full, he returned toward it.
  Chetusingh picked up both lanterns; the Chinese girl followed him. and they
  two led the way down the tunnel. The commissioner flashed his light in
  Henrietta's face, then in Blair's:</p>

  <p>"You're dead beat, both of you. Can you climb to the cave where the
  cistern is? I've blankets, a spot of whiskey and some grub in a haversack.
  Sleep a bit, and then both of you tell me all about it. When I've seen this
  place by daylight, you, Chetusingh and two more men will get cement and seal
  up the wall that leads out of that burned crypt. After that we'll plug
  Ganesha's image tight to the wall and break the rollers somehow. Then we'll
  see if that gap can be reached from outside."</p>

  <p>"It can't," said Henrietta. "I've tried. It can't even be seen."</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll look. Come along. Lean on me if you're tired. Blair, this
  can't be told. We've got to keep it secret. As soon as you're rested, you and
  Chetusingh go straight for Dur-i-Duran Singh of Nagu Kulu. He knows too much.
  If he doesn't talk, he'll be trying to get in here. I depend on you to scotch
  him. Now let's hurry."</p>

  <p>"Hurry! Hurry!" said the echoes.</p>

  <p>"Come on."</p>

  <p>"Come on! Come on!" They pursued titanic echoes into darkness, toward a
  world in which three dimensions make trouble enough.</p>

  <p>"Let's pray&mdash;" said the commissioner.</p>

  <p>"Let's pray&mdash; let's pray&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We can keep this secret!"</p>

  <p>"Secret!&mdash; Secret!&mdash;"</p>
