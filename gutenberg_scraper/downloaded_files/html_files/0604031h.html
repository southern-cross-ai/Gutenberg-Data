<p class="first"><i>'Until the nineteenth century, actors were
classed as Rogues &amp; Vagrants. They were outside of
respectable society&mdash;like Kings&mdash;and I am not sure but
that this was better for their art and their happiness than to be
classed as lecturers, tax-payers, tennis-players, suburban
householders, and lovers of dogs.'

<h2>NOTICE</h2>

<p class="first">No character in this novel is the portrait of an
actual person, and if there is any resemblance to the name of a
real person, it is accidental.</p>

<p>Such notices as this have become increasingly familiar because
of an increasing habit among readers of finding themselves
portrayed in every novel, and of being annoyed or unduly pleased.
It is particularly necessary in this book because in recent years
I have been acquainted with six summer theatres and with a
touring play. I declare vigorously that the Nutmeg Players of
Point Grampion, in my tale, are not drawn from the Stockbridge,
Cohasset, Ogunquit, Provincetown, Clinton, or Skowhegan
companies, and that the tour of a <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
company, here chronicled, is not the history of my <i>Angela Is
Twenty-Two.</i> And Sladesbury is not Hartford, but the county
seat of Cloud-Cuckoo-Land.</p>

<p>I hope that this signboard may have some effect. After the
appearance of <i>Arrowsmith</i> I was informed that at least half
my medical characters had been drawn from professors of whom I
had never heard. With <i>It Can't Happen Here,</i> adherents of
two editors, one in Vermont and one in Connecticut, gave rather
convincing proof that each of these gentlemen was the model for
Doremus Jessup. But the happy days were with <i>Elmer Gantry</i>
when, on the same Sunday morning, in the same Western city, each
of two clergymen announced from his pulpit that the Reverend
Elmer had been drawn solely from him, but that the portrait was
crooked.</p>

<p>I shall not explain to self-elected prototypes of my Bethel
Merriday or Roscoe Valentine just how I probed their own lives;
and if it shall prove that there really are persons so
unfortunate as to be named Zed Wintergeist or Mrs. Lumley Boyle
or Mrs. J. Goddard Deacon or Jerome Jordan O'Toole or Tudor
Blackwall, I shall merely point out that there is a tradition
that fiction characters have to be called <i>something.</i></p>

<p>Of course writers might call them X76 &mdash; 4 or Pi R
Square.</p>

<p>But if we did, all the persons with automobile licences
numbered X76 &mdash; 4 and all the coolies named Pi Lung Squong
would write to us, which heaven forbid.</p>

<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p class="first">THAT was the first time that anyone ever called
her an actress&mdash;June 1st, 1922, Bethel's sixth birthday.
There was no spotlight, no incidental music, and her only
audience were her mother and a small dog looking regretfully
through the window of a boarding-house. But she was
sensational.</p>

<p>Her mother and she were on their way to the A. &amp; P. Store,
and as usual Bethel had with the greatest violence been running
in circles. She was slight and small and entirely feminine, but
she was the best runner in her neighbourhood.</p>

<p>She stopped, then moved with a queer slow hitching. In front
of them an old lady was scraping along, sunk forward from her
shoulders as though she had given up all hope of ease and love.
Her whole life seemed to be in her painfully sliding feet. Bethel
tried to recreate that dejected walk, and she went at it so
earnestly that the back of her neck ached with the weight of
sagging shoulders, and every step was a frightened effort.</p>

<p>Her mother interrupted.</p>

<p>'Good gracious, don't copy folks that way, Bethel. You'll hurt
their feelings.'</p>

<p>The small, black-eyed child halted, in protest.</p>

<p>'Oh! I'm not copying her. I'm trying to be her. I can be a lot
of different people.'</p>

<p>'My, aren't we grown-up! I'm afraid that you like to show off,
dear&mdash;the way you always say your text so loud in Sunday
school.'</p>

<p>'I love to say texts! "I will praise thee, O Lord, with my
whole heart. I will show forth all thy marvellous works".'</p>

<p>'It all sounds like maybe you're going to be an actress. I
guess that wouldn't be a bad text for an actress.'</p>

<p>'Look how the poor old lady's heels are run down,' said
Bethel, too busy with her career for prophecies of glory.</p>

<p>Bethel was born in 1916, on the day after the Battle of
Jutland. Her father, kneeling by the bed, had prayed, <i>'Dear
Lord, please make this baby a child of peace and
justice&mdash;yes, and happiness, Lord'.</i></p>

<p>Five months after the six-year-old Bethel gave her imitation
of the old lady, the Black Shirts marched bravely into the maws
of the movie cameras in Rome; and five months after that, Hitler
bounded out of a Munich beer garden. But perhaps it was as
important that at this time John Barrymore was playing
<i>Hamlet</i> and Pauline Lord <i>Anna Christie</i> and the
Theatre Guild producing <i>Back to Methuselah.</i> They were so
much less stagy.</p>

<p><br>
Herbert Merriday, Bethel's father, was a dealer in furniture,
to which, later, he was importantly to add electric refrigerators
and radios. They lived in Sladesbury, a city of 127,000, in
central Connecticut, a fount of brassware, hardware, arms,
precision instruments, clocks. Here is the renowned establishment
of Lilydale &amp; Duck, makers of machine-guns for killing
policemen and revolvers for killing gangsters and the Duck
Typewriter for joyfully chronicling both brands of killing.</p>

<p>Sladesbury is Yankee, not Colonial, and it envies and scorns
the leisurely grace of Litchfield and Sharon. It proclaims itself
constantly as 'modern', and is beginning to boast of being
'streamlined'.</p>

<p>Even for Sladesbury, the Merriday family stood high in
modernity. They had been the first family to have a radio
installed in their car, and Mrs. Merriday, though she was a solid
Universalist, was so advanced as to belong to the Birth-Control
League.</p>

<p>In May of 1931 Bethel was almost fifteen, and finishing
sophomore year in high school. It was suitable to the
neighbourhood modernity that her brother Benny, now twenty-one,
should be working in the Dutton Aeroplane Works, and talking
about designs for transatlantic clippers, talking about (though
never actually reading) the Bible by Karl Marx, and that the
girls she knew should be talking about careers. They wanted homes
and babies as much as their mothers had, but none of them
expected to be entirely supported by husbands. Most of them were,
they asserted, going to be aeroplane hostesses, motion-picture
stars or radio artists, though certain of the less studious sort
confessed that they would not mind being 'hostesses' in the large
dance halls.</p>

<p>Bethel could not look upon serving cold consomm&eacute; at an
altitude of a mile, or dancing the rumba, as having much meaning.
She was learning touch typewriting in high school&mdash;that was
her father's one insistence about her studies&mdash;and she could
become a secretary, busy and important, receiving the boss's
magnificent callers. But privately, ever since her sixth
birthday, she had yearned to be an actress.</p>

<p>As she had never seen a play with professional actors, she was
shaky as to just what being an actress implied, and certainly she
never admitted to her companions so eccentric an ambition. She
was one of a whole generation of youngsters under twenty who
considered the London of Shakespeare and the Paris of
Moli&egrave;re as barbaric and rather comic, who were familiar
with radio broadcasts from Madrid and aeroplanes just landed from
Alaska and two-million-dollar film dramas and the theory of the
atom, but half of whom had never seen a real play or entered an
art gallery or heard an orchestra play anything but dance
music.</p>

<p>Bethel herself had seen only a high-school farce, in which a
football player in a red wig kept kicking a fat boy; a Republican
party pageant in Brewster Park, with Lawyer Wilkie as Lincoln,
heavily accented as to shawl and beard; and the melodramas about
gun-molls and sunken submarines which Alva Prindle and Bethel
herself performed on the workbench in the Prindle garage. So
altogether futile and babyish seemed the intention of acting that
probably she would not have confessed it to her friends Alva
Prindle and Charley Hatch on that evening in May 1931, had the
newspapers not been hinting that, for the first time in ten
years, Sladesbury was to have a professional stock company all
summer long.</p>

<p>And it was one of her queer, secret, sensitized days when she
saw everything with intolerable acuteness.</p>

<p>When she awoke, that Saturday in May, the morning was
bewitched with fog.</p>

<p>She had, proudly, a room of her own, with a candlewick cover
on a spool bed of 1860. Benny, the worshipper of new machinery,
laughed at the bed as old-fashioned, but she prized it as somehow
connected with Pilgrims who shot wild turkeys with blunderbusses
on Thanksgiving Day, and came home to drink hot toddies in the
company of grey ladies in poke bonnets.</p>

<p>She also had a shaky white-painted desk of her own, with a
bookshelf on which were a complete Shakespeare, an Edgar Wallace
novel, a Mary Roberts Rinehart novel, a ragged volume of Keats, a
manual of tennis, and No. 1567 in the Haldeman-Julius Little Blue
Books, namely, <i>Making Men Happy with Jams and Jellies.</i> The
wallpaper was canary yellow, with small scarlet birds; the rug
was blue. She loved her secure retreat and its friendly
brightness.</p>

<p>But this morning of mist was forlorn to her as she crawled
out, in her blue-and-white-striped pyjamas, her bobbed hair,
which was very black, flickering above her charming shoulders,
which were very white. She was afraid, or pretended that she was
afraid, to look out of the window&mdash;and then looked. The
Hatch house, next door, had alarmingly vanished in the fog. The
elms were hard pillars, their foliage unseen; the silver birch
was chilly as winter.</p>

<p>On such a day, even at her mature age of fourteen years and
eleven months, she could again convince herself that she was the
foundling child of wicked gipsies.</p>

<p>She knew that all this was quite insane. But there was a good,
efficient, earthy Bethel who always guarded the mad Bethel, and
who now insisted that being a gipsy was no crazier than her
father's love for assaulting golf balls, or her mother's stated
belief that anyone born in New Hampshire was handsomer and
healthier than any Vermonter.</p>

<p>As Bethel wriggled and rubbed herself under the shower
bath&mdash;oh yes, the Merridays were as modern as all
that&mdash;and drew on her bloomers, her rolled stockings, her
flowery cotton dress, she was prim and a little stern, that she
might not betray her Crazy Ideas.</p>

<p>Things were not right, downstairs.</p>

<p>The house was only ten years old, and the living-room was
still of suitable modernness, with interior decorations correct
by the highest standards of the women's magazines: a large,
frameless mirror over the white fireplace, reflecting two marble
vases; a glass-topped nickelled coffee table in front of the
convertible davenport; on the wall, a travel souvenir in the way
of a 'Ye Motor Mappe of Ye Quaint Olde Cape Codde', depicting
whales and Pilgrims; an enormous combination radio and
phonograph, shining like syrup; and no books whatever. But to the
revolutionary Bethel, this morning, the room was as oppressive as
too hot a bath.</p>

<p>She apologized to herself that her father and her mother and
her house were really very nice. But a little smug...?</p>

<p>Then she first really discovered ash trays; then she found
that ash trays can be fascinating but horrible. On the coffee
table was a still unemptied tray; a half-sphere of rock crystal,
which should have been spotless, shining as a handful of upper
air, but was smeared now with black ash stains and filled with
dead paper matches and cigarette stubs like the twisted dead
white arms of babies. The whole thing, she shuddered, was a shell
pit, only smaller.</p>

<p>But she seized herself and pushed herself on into the
dining-room, with a reproving, 'You're <i>imagining</i> things!'</p>

<p>'Good morning, Beth. That's doing pretty well. Only ten
minutes late. You look as if you slept pretty well,' said her
father.</p>

<p>'Foggy enough for you to-day?' said Gwendolyn, the hired
girl.</p>

<p>'Hya, Toots. Hya, handsome,' said her brother.</p>

<p>'Good morning, dear. You look cheerful, this morning,' said
her mother.</p>

<p>(She didn't feel cheerful, and she was hanged if she'd
<i>be</i> cheerful, not all day long, she reflected. But if they
thought she looked so, she must be doing some good acting.)</p>

<p>She studied her corn flakes, and found that corn flakes are as
fastastically [<i>sic</i>] improbable as ash trays, once your
eyes were open. They certainly didn't look like food. Food was
lamb chops and chop suey and corn on the cob and apple pie
<i>&agrave; la mode;</i> these things were twists of brown paper,
with minute bubbles on their speckled surfaces. What a thing to
eat!</p>

<p>She did eat them, and enjoyed them very much, but now she was
at the fascinated vexation of studying just how they all ate. Her
father sturdily opened his lips up and down like a pair of trap
doors, showing his teeth. Her mother nibbled like a rabbit, her
faded pink lips (she would not use her lipstick till she went to
the bridge club this afternoon) trembled a little and hid her
teeth. And Brother Ben twisted his mouth sidewise, with the right
corner of it scornfully elevated.</p>

<p>She tried to imitate them all.</p>

<p>'What are you daydreaming about, dear?' said her father.</p>

<p>'Eat your nice hot muffins, Beth,' said her mother.</p>

<p>'I hope you'll know me the next time you see me,' said her
brother.</p>

<p>'What makes it foggy to-day?' said Bethel.</p>

<p>'The fog,' said Ben.</p>

<p><br>
For two hours, that schoolless Saturday morning, she worked in
her father's store, polishing tables and radio cabinets. Her
hands were swift, and she liked seeing the sleek grain of the
wood emerge from dullness. But as this was, she luxuriously
sighed, one of her poetic days, she would spend all afternoon in
Brewster Park. It had a grove of thick Japanese walnuts with a
tiny stream, and there, on a small pad of the best linen
correspondence paper, she would write a poem about the Grecian
city hall... She was much given to writing poetry, except that
she never had been able to write more than a dozen lines of
it.</p>

<p>But into the store bounced her friend Alva Prindle, to demand
that she come to the North Side Tennis Club that afternoon.</p>

<p>Alva Prindle was a big, beautiful, bouncing blonde. She was
born that way; she was spiritually like that; she would have been
a big, beautiful, bouncing blonde even if she had been as dark
and delicately made as Bethel. It was Alva whom the high-school
girls had nominated as a future Queen of Hollywood.</p>

<p>Bethel did play tennis that afternoon, and she played well
enough, and she hated it. She felt that there must be something
complicated and wrong in herself, for while just that morning she
had been able to see herself as Lady Macbeth, satisfyingly
murderous and flamboyant before an audience of two thousand, this
afternoon, showing off her rapid, accurate, nervous little serve
before an audience of not more than a dozen musical young
gentlemen aged sixteen, she was terrified; she was embarrassed
every time Alva answered the gallery's 'Good work, beautiful',
with a merry: 'Go climb a tree'. (Alva varied it by retorting,
'Go lay an egg' or 'Go jump in the lake'.)</p>

<p>The North Side Tennis Club was founded by the
medium-successful retail merchants, the minor doctors and lawyers
and insurance agents and real-estate sellers of Sladesbury, to
give their children something of the social glory of the private
<i>en-tout-cas</i> courts of the bank vice-presidents and the
factory owners. Its club house was a one-room shack with a
counter at which were sold Coca-Cola, orangeade, cigarettes,
chewing-gum and stale sweet crackers, but this counter was to
Bethel what Twenty-One and El Morocco and the Stork Club and the
like New York exhibits of elegance and celebrity were some day to
seem.</p>

<p>Alva dragged her in there after the match. The young men
lounged on high stools, drinking soda from bottles through
straws, and singing 'She Didn't Say Yes, She Didn't Say No'.</p>

<p>The sanctities of Prohibition had more than two years to run,
and the young people still considered it a social duty to drink
raw gin. The oldest of their group&mdash;Morris Bass, the
handsome, the fast-driving, the generous, the loudly lecherous,
eighteen and the sole scion of a catsup factory&mdash;was urging
on them cheer from a gin bottle with a counterfeited Gordon
label. Alva had a shot of it in her root beer and began to
giggle.</p>

<p>Not till now had anyone like Morris Bass ever given heed to
Bethel, but this afternoon (she was flattered, so baronial was he
in his pink-and-apricot sweater, his white-linen plus fours, his
oiled chestnut hair) he dragged her by the arm to a bench outside
the club shack, poured half a glass of gin into her sarsaparilla,
and with heavily breathing satisfaction pushed his heavy arm
about her waist... In her life, she had tasted gin perhaps
twice; certainly no gallant had embraced her publicly. The Modern
Merridays did not hold with drunkenness and public
slobbering.</p>

<p>'Please!' she begged.</p>

<p>'What's a matter? Don't you like hootch?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, I think I do, but I've been playing tennis so
hard&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Go on! Bottoms up!'</p>

<p>A stir of pride and rebellion ran through her profound
shyness. She set the drink on the ground and drew his arm from
about her.</p>

<p>'Little Puritan, eh? Haw, haw, haw!'</p>

<p>'No! I'm not! Of course I'm not!'</p>

<p>It must be admitted that to Bethel, like most children in most
Sladesburys in the 1930's, it was worse to be prudish than to be
loose. She was sorry that she didn't like to have Morris's thick
red hand pawing her white linen blouse.</p>

<p>'No! Of course I'm not a Puritan!'</p>

<p>'Then what's a matter? First time I ever got a good eyeful of
you, this afternoon. You played pretty good tennis. And you got
nice legs. I guess you won't ever get thick ankles, and that's a
girl's best point, believe you me. So what's eating you? Not
afraid of a little necking, are you?'</p>

<p>He kissed her, greasily.</p>

<p>She was up and away from him, all in one compact movement. 'I
just don't like uncooked beefsteak!'</p>

<p>She ran like a leopard.</p>

<p>As she reached home, her only conclusion was that 'necking' in
itself seemed interesting but that, unfortunately, something in
her would always make her sick of the Morris Basses and all
persons who drank out of bottles and exploded in laughter. Were
actors ever like Morris? she wondered. Would it keep her from
being an actress?</p>

<p>'There won't be any people like that in <i>my</i> theatre,
when I'm running a show!' she snapped; and it is curious, not to
be explained, that she should have said that, because never in
her life had she heard of an actor-manager, of an
actress-producer.</p>

<p>She knew nothing beyond the names of Sarah Bernhardt and Duse
and Mrs. Fiske and Ethel Barrymore; nothing of the young Helen
Hayes, except as a movie actress, nor of the young Katharine
Cornell, who just then was appearing in <i>The Barretts of
Wimpole Street.</i> Like a child born to be a painter, she got
her ideas from the wind, the earth; and this moment she, who
couldn't possibly have known about anything of the kind, saw
herself in a star's dressing-room, halting her making-up to look
at a bill for new props, and then, ever so gently and
sympathetically, giving a drunken leading man his two weeks'
notice.</p>

<p>After such eminence, it was with a good deal of quiet dignity
that she went into the kitchen to help Gwendolyn, the youthful
cook, wash the vegetables for dinner. (For fifteen years now the
Modern Merridays had had evening dinner at seven instead of
evening supper at six.)</p>

<p>'Have a nice time playing tennis?' bubbled Gwendolyn, who was
the lady-love of a prominent bus driver.</p>

<p>'Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;pretty nice...'</p>

<p>(Silver lace and a tiara&mdash;the queen enthroned,
centre-stage. Dirt-crusted bars and the hateful teeth of grinning
guards&mdash;the queen waiting for the guillotine.)</p>

<p>'Still foggy near the river, Beth?'</p>

<p>'I don't&mdash;no, I don't guess it was quite so foggy.'</p>

<p>(A young farmwife who has hidden her murderer-husband in the
attic, and who faces expressionless the searching sheriffs.)</p>

<p>'What're you so quiet about? Guess you must be in love.'</p>

<p>'I am not!' And Bethel shuddered. Love did not, to her, seem a
mystery to be funny about.</p>

<p>With dignity and a degree of hunger for all the whipped cream
of culture, she paraded royally into the living-room and put an
aria from <i>Carmen</i> on the phonograph. She did not hear it
through. She was so suddenly and bewilderingly sleepy that she
dashed up to her little room and till dinnertime slept like a
kitten.</p>

<p>The star is sleeping, as only stars can sleep.</p>

<p>With the blonde goddess, Alva Prindle, and Charley Hatch, the
sturdy, soothing, rather stupid boy next door who was Bethel's
trustiest friend, she went to the Connecticut Palace Motion
Picture Theatre that evening, and breathlessly viewed <i>The
Heart of an Understudy.</i></p>

<p>There was, it seems, a woman star, beautiful but wicked, and
jealously devoted to ruining the fine young leading man by
scandal-hinting and cruel looks instead of by the simpler and
much more effective weapon of upstaging him. This lady fiend had
an understudy, a poor foundling girl, who had learned her
histrionic craft in a Seventh Day Adventist Home for Orphans. The
understudy hadn't a friend in the company except the kind young
leading man, who carried her bags on overnight jumps.</p>

<p>So the wicked star also persecuted the understudy, till the
glorious night when the star fell ill (with a particularly sudden
onset of author's disease) and the understudy went on, and played
so radiantly, so competently, that the critics and a lot of
reporters&mdash;who just happened to be in the theatre on that
ninety-third night of the New York run&mdash;wrote reports which
were given two-column heads in all the dailies: 'Miss Dolly
Daintree Greatest Theatrical Find of Years: Unknown Girl Thrills
Thousands at the Pantaloon Theatre.'</p>

<p>The star seemed distinctly annoyed by this until, dying, she
discovered that the unknown female genius was her own daughter,
by some marriage that she had forgotten, and handed her over to
the arms of the hero, along with a sizable
estate&mdash;presumably so that they wouldn't have to go on
acting.</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous movie, with shots of the Twentieth Century
train, supper with the producer at the Waldorf, and gilt cupids
on the star's pink bed. There was even a tricky shot in which a
minor movie actor acted as though he were a trained actor
acting.</p>

<p>When the screen had darkened, Bethel did not merely
hope&mdash;she joyously knew that she was going to be an
actress.</p>

<p>She confessed it to Alva and Charley Hatch at their
after-theatre supper at the Rex Pharmacy and Luncheonette.</p>

<p>The Rex, a drugstore which was less of a drugstore than a
bookstore, less of a bookstore than a cigar store, less of a
cigar store than a restaurant, was characteristic of a somewhat
confused purpose in American institutions, whereby the government
has been a producer of plays and motion pictures, movie producers
are owners of racing stables, churches are gymnasiums and dance
halls, telegraph offices are agencies for flowers and tickets,
authors are radio comedians, aviators are authors, and the
noblest purpose of newspapers is to publish photographs of
bathing girls.</p>

<p>The actual drug department at the Rex consisted of a short
counter laden with perfume bottles and of a small dark man who
looked angry; but along one whole side were magnificent booths
with ebonite tables shining like black glass. Here, cosily, the
three children, world-weary connoisseurs of radio programmes and
ventilation systems for motor-cars, supped on a jumbo malted
milk, a maple pecan sundae and a frosted coffee.</p>

<p>'That was a wonderful movie. That dress the star had on at the
dance must of cost a thousand dollars,' said Alva.</p>

<p>'Yuh, pretty good. That was swell where she bawled out the
fellow in an aeroplane and <i>he</i> said he'd chuck her
overboard if she didn't shut her trap,' said Charley.</p>

<p>'I'm going to be an actress,' said Bethel.</p>

<p>Alva gurgled noisily with a straw. 'Look who's here! You don't
think you're serious?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I am!'</p>

<p>'Honest, Beth, you aren't so bad, in a mousy kind of
way&mdash;you got nice big eyes and a kind of, oh, ivory skin,
but if you tackled Hollywood, the producers would laugh
themselves sick. Now I <i>am</i> going in the movies. Maybe I'm
dumb&mdash;I can't do Cicero like you can&mdash;but I got the
build.'</p>

<p>Alva made rather indelicate motions, denoting curves.</p>

<p>'I'm not going to Hollywood. I'm going to be a stage actress.
And be able to <i>act,</i> like that understudy.'</p>

<p>'Honest, Beth, you slay me!'</p>

<p>'I am! I'm going to study voice in college&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You better study mascara! Beth, there ain't any stage
actresses any more! All that old-fashioned junk has gone out.
Plays!'</p>

<p>'You've never seen one.'</p>

<p>'I read about 'em in <i>Movie and Mike Weekly.</i> What's a
stage play got? Couple scenes, maybe three, and six-eight actors,
where in the movies, lookit what they show you&mdash;a castle on
the Riveera and a submarine torpedo room and the Paris fashions
and a Chinese geisha girl and everything; and in a show you
wouldn't get but sixty dollars a week, but in the movies I'll get
a thousand! Hot dog! I'm going to have a sable coat!'</p>

<p>More sympathetic, Charley offered, 'No, you don't want to be
an actress, Beth. They all lead immoral lives. And you wouldn't
like it on the stage. You'd be scared. You're kind of shy. You
better be a nurse.'</p>

<p>'I will not! I'm going to act.'</p>

<p>'Maybe you could organize an amateur show in the
hospital.'</p>

<p>'I'm not going to be an amateur. I'm not going to play at
playing. No! <i>It isn't good enough!'</i></p>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<p class="first">ONCE upon a time Sladesbury, with its population
of more than a hundred thousand, had known a dozen touring
companies a year: Sothern and Marlowe, Maude Adams in <i>Peter
Pan,</i> Arnold Daly in <i>Candida;</i> and had supported a
permanent stock company, presenting fifty plays, from <i>As You
Like It</i> to <i>Charley's Aunt,</i> in fifty weeks of the
year.</p>

<p>Now in 1931 not one professional play had been presented in
Sladesbury for more than five years. The block of old-fashioned
spacious buildings which had contained the Twitchell
Theatre&mdash;opened by Edwin Booth&mdash;the Latin Academy, and
the Armoury of the Honourable Company of Foot had been replaced
by a gold-and-scarlet filling station, a Serv-Ur-Self food
market, and a Bar-B-Q Lunch which lent refinement to hamburger
sandwiches by cooking them with electricity.</p>

<p>The former stock-company theatre, the Crystal, had long been a
motion-picture establishment. But by Bethel's fifteenth birthday,
June 1st, 1931, it was certain that the Crystal would gamble
again with living actors. The Sladesbury that manufactured
aeroplane motors was going to become as modern as Athens in 500
B.C. The <i>Daily Advocate</i> announced that the 'Caryl McDermid
Stock Company of Broadway Actors' would take over the Crystal, on
June 15th, and play through the summer.</p>

<p>For Bethel, heaven had come to Charter Oak Avenue.</p>

<p>She cut out the daily notices and pictures of the company. She
pondered over the photographs of McDermid, the actor-manager,
with his handsome square face, his lively eyes, his thick hair
low on his forehead, his wide mouth. Proudly, as though he
belonged to her&mdash;was she not the greatest local patroness of
the drama?&mdash;Bethel noted that sometimes he looked like a
factory executive, sometimes like a soldier-explorer, once, in
rags, like a poet vagabond; proudly she learned that he had been
a star in the silent motion pictures and had toured with Otis
Skinner and Frank Craven.</p>

<p>She had always considered it shameless to be seen loitering on
Charter Oak Avenue, whistled at by the interested knots of young
loafers who at this period were called 'drug-store cowboys', but
now she went out of her way to stop in front of the Crystal and
study the pictures of the cast: McDermid bejewelled in
<i>Richelieu</i> and terrifying as the Emperor Jones; Miss Maggie
Sample comic as Mrs. Wiggs; and the pale glory of Irma Wheat as
St. Joan.</p>

<p>Dearest to Bethel of all these pictured gods was Elsie Krall,
a fragile girl who seemed, for all the stiffness of her
Shakespearian ruff and brocade, not much older than herself. If
she had one friend like Elsie, she would attack Broadway in
another year, and a year after that she would be a famous
actress!</p>

<p>When the large red-and-black show bills were plastered about
town, and the names of Mr. McDermid and Miss Wheat stared at her,
she felt as though it were her own name that was thus startlingly
discovered.</p>

<p>The first play of the McDermid season was <i>The Silver
Cord,</i> by Sidney Howard, of whom Bethel had never
heard&mdash;as she had never heard of Pinero or Somerset Maugham
or Clyde Fitch. The press notes said that the play was 'a story
of mother love fighting for itself'. Bethel pictured the mother
as a pioneer in a log cabin, doing exciting things with an
axe.</p>

<p>She wanted so feverishly to go to the opening night that she
did not let herself go till Wednesday. But it was a youthful
self-discipline in her (the kind that might some day take her
through all-night rehearsals), rather than a Connecticut
Puritanism whereby anything she wanted to do was wicked. By no
discipline, however, could she keep away longer than
Wednesday.</p>

<p>It was a part of the era and the country that it did not occur
to her parents, since it was known that she had no taste for
glossy young drunks, to prohibit her going out by herself in the
evening, provided she was back by eleven-thirty. And even in
these depression days, when the family were putting off buying a
new car and Mr. Merriday was worrying about having to cut the
staff in his store, it was sacred to them that Bethel should have
'her own income'&mdash;two dollars a week, theoretically her
salary for working in the store on Saturdays.</p>

<p>She could get no one to go with her to the theatre.</p>

<p>She knew that her father and mother and brother would no more
go to a play than to a chess tournament, and that neither Charley
Hatch nor Alva Prindle would pay a dollar to hear six actors,
when for half of that they could see six hundred. Bethel felt as
lone and venturous as a young-lady Christian martyr in a den of
Roman lions. She longed to wear her party dress of yellow
taffeta, but even as a Christian martyr she could not endure the
comments of her brother, and it was in the humility of skirt and
sweater that she went off to her first play.</p>

<p>'Give you a lift?' yelled Charley, as she passed the Hatch
cottage.</p>

<p>'No! I&mdash;I got to meet a friend,' said Bethel.</p>

<p>The crowd that was wavering into the Crystal Theatre was none
too large, but Bethel was a little frightened by it. She felt
herself the only greenhorn and hoped that she would not betray
herself. By the most acute figuring she had arrived at the
theatre exactly five minutes before the announced curtain time,
so she was a quarter of an hour early. She was in awe of the
veteran-looking doorman, who snatched her ticket and irreverently
tore it, of the young gentleman who was demanding hats to check,
of the supercilious girl ushers.</p>

<p>She climbed, panting, to the balcony, and came out under a
noble ceiling with frescoes of pink goddesses sitting on gilt
clouds and leering. She was shamed by having to crawl past the
rigid knees of four early-comers, and wanted to apologize to
them, and was afraid to. But when she had sunk down on the stony
leatherette seat in the front row of the balcony, she felt
secure, she felt at home.</p>

<p>She looked beatifically at the curtain, which appropriately
depicted the Bay of Naples. The orchestra members, handsomest and
most artistic of men, crawled from under the stage and scratched
themselves a little and whispered and looked up&mdash;not at her,
Bethel hoped&mdash;and then relented and sat down to play a
Wienerwalz.</p>

<p>Bethel's soul skipped with ecstasy. She read every word in the
slim programme, even the advertisement of The Mount Vernon
Funeral Home, Where Sympathy Is Our Watchword, Phone Night or
Day. She noted that Elsie Krall, the girl actress whose picture
she had loved, was playing a character called Hester. She primly
folded the programme, then bent over the rail and prayed for a
larger house. But the place was only half filled when her heart
turned over as the orchestra shivered and stopped. The house
lights were dimmed, and for the first time during the fifteen
years that she had waited for it, Bethel knew the magic pause,
the endless second of anticipation, with just a fringe of light
at the bottom of the curtain, before it went up.</p>

<p>She had never been so happy.</p>

<p>Instantly she was disappointed. Here was no battling mother in
a frontier cabin, no fetching young man in buckskins, but a girl
of to-day reading Sunday newspapers of to-day in a room that
might have been in any of the old 'mansions' on Bucks Hill,
Sladesbury. But she saw that the girl on the couch was Elsie
Krall, and that the pictures had not revealed Elsie's surprising
copper hair, or the eggshell texture of her skin, pale above
cheeks scarlet with make-up. She seemed frightened; and Bethel
loved her for it; felt herself up there on the stage, reassuring
Elsie.</p>

<p>But Bethel's affections, so bewilderingly fickle this evening,
instantly shifted to Caryl McDermid, as the star himself opened
the double doors and smiled his way on stage. He was Apollo in
single-breasted heather mixture. He couldn't be more than
twenty-eight, decided Bethel. Of course that was thirteen years
older than herself, but if she grew fast and caught up with him,
maybe she could some day know him and win his heart.</p>

<br>

<p>He was speaking, in a voice hearty and electric: 'Isn't mother
at home?'</p>

<p>She loved the lily-swaying Irma Wheat, as Christina; and with
a hate warmer than love, she hated Maggie Sample, the stage
mother; a handsome, authoritative, menacing Juno of fifty. And
all the while she forgot that she was at a play. This was life,
and she was in it.</p>

<p>She hadn't known that there were plays in which the characters
talked like real people, and in which you could live and struggle
and forget yourself.</p>

<p>The story was of a mother who, to hold her sons, was willing
to break up their marriages and reduce them to babyhood. Bethel
particularly loved the brave Hester&mdash;Elsie
Krall&mdash;fianc&eacute;e of the younger son; she bounced in her
seat with hope that Hester would leave the young pup.</p>

<p>In the intermissions, she did not go out, and she glanced
rather snippily at people so unimaginative that they could
chatter and walk about. And all the time she knew, beyond
argument, that she was going to be an actress.</p>

<p>She came out of the theatre as drunk as a bacchante; a
pitiable and happy sight. She wavered home under the summer elms,
and felt that she was shouting poetry, though she was not
thinking at all about moonlight and roses or swords and
barricades, but repeating over and over, rather queerly,
'Sterility&mdash;that's your professional mother's stock in
trade'. As she came up to the Merriday porch, where Charley Hatch
and her brother Ben were dangling their legs and discussing
gliders and Colonel Lindbergh, she stopped, staring at them,
swaying.</p>

<p>'What's the matter with you, Toots? You stay up too late.
Gwan, get to bed,' said her brother.</p>

<p>'All right.'</p>

<p>'Did you like the show?' demanded Charley.</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;I guess so&mdash;all right.'</p>

<p>'I knew you wouldn't like it!' crowed Ben.</p>

<p>'I did so! I thought it was the most wonderful thing I ever
saw.'</p>

<p>'Rats!'</p>

<p>'I did!'</p>

<p>She wanted to cry, but she mastered it and crept up to her
room, her refuge.</p>

<p>She paced, unable to stop and undress. She found herself
re-enacting the play and, curiously, it was not her own Elsie
Krall whom she mimicked, but the mother. Sitting on the edge of
the bed, crouched, obviously broken, yet with a hint that she
enjoyed showing off her woes, her elbows on her knees and her
hands dangling absurdly, she muttered,</p>

<p>'"I'm not asking you to be sorry. It's&mdash;" How did it go,
now? "It's Robin I'm thinking of. And now that I'm old and sick... dying&mdash;"'</p>

<p>Her memory ran out, but she could not sleep. She was acting a
thousand plays; she was an Arabian woman watching her son die of
hunger; she was a Russian princess and then she was a Russian
commissar accusing the princess; she was a 'bathing cutie', very
tough; and she was a ghost-pale abbess. She clawed her complete
Shakespeare down from the shelf and read a dozen speeches from
<i>The Merchant of Venice</i> aloud, sitting primly in a straight
chair by the window, where the net curtains whispered in the
night.</p>

<p>Portia's speech, of course; but more eagerly, Jessica and
Lorenzo.</p>

<p>She was on the avenue in Belmont; the trunks of the great
trees&mdash;lime trees, was that right?&mdash;were white-washed,
and visible in the silvered darkness.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse"> The moon shines bright: in such a night as
this,<br>

When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees<br>

And they did make no noise, in such a night<br>

Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls,<br>

And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents<br>

Where Cressid lay that night.'</p>

<br>

<p>Thus Lorenzo, round and manly. She laid the book down on the
edge of her small bureau, on the starched white cover embroidered
with violets; she held out unsteady hands; she leaped up (not in
the least knowing that she was doing so) and in the mirror
watched her face grow soft, her lips imploring. She hastily sat
down and read on. She was Jessica:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

'In such a night<br>

Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,<br>

Stealing her soul with many vows of faith<br>

And ne'er a true one.'</p>

<br>

<p>The audience was hushed. She had been so wistfully gay; so
tender yet so appealing. Then the applause, like a breaker! By
the window again, she was reading:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

'... Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow
sea; the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very dangerous
flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie
buried...'</p>

<br>

<p>Thus Salarino, on a street in Venice. She saw the street
perfectly; it ran by a canal, under archways. (She laid her head
on her arm on the window sill.) She herself&mdash;yes, she was
Salarino; masked and cloaked, hand on rapier hilt, slipping off
to a rendezvous. A gondola, in the canal below, was revealed in
the light from a lamp far up in a harsh wall, and Salarino
saw&mdash;Bethel saw&mdash;a girl in white satin, flower-crowned,
in the arms of a man young but bearded and angry-eyed...</p>

<p>She started out of her dream and it was dawn. She was
painfully stiff, but she was in ecstasy. Then she shook her head
vigorously, rubbed her shoulders, and snorted, 'Don't be so
silly, Bethel! Go to bed!'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<p class="first">HOWEVER much she tried to conceal her emotion
when she told him about having seen <i>The Silver Cord,</i>
Charley Hatch saw that it was going to be difficult to 'cure her
of this crazy notion that she was going to try and be an
actress'.</p>

<p>Charley was a friendly boy, rather like a kind old milk-wagon
horse. His hobby was collecting stamps. 'You learn a lot about
geography and foreign places and so on from stamps,' he stated.
He wanted to be a farmer; but to his father, who himself had come
from a farm, this would have been a shocking retrogression from
his urban position as superintendent of a bus line; so Charley
was planning to become an osteopath. He had soft tow hair on a
large, thick skull, and he whistled constantly.</p>

<p>'Lookit, Beth,' he implored, as they sat on a branch of a
maple, twenty feet up in the air. 'Of course a girl wouldn't know
about all such things&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I bet I would!'</p>

<p>'&mdash;but you got no idea what you'd be up against if you
tried to go and get to be an actress and went looking for a job
on Broadway. It's full of pitfalls.'</p>

<p>'Pitfalls?'</p>

<p>'Pitfalls.'</p>

<p>'What kind of pitfalls?'</p>

<p>'Awful pitfalls! Managers and all like that, that betray young
girls.'</p>

<p>'How do they betray them?'</p>

<p>'You wouldn't understand.'</p>

<p>'What do they do to 'em?'</p>

<p>'Beth! What language! It ain't ladylike. Golly! You're already
showing what awful influence the stage has got on you. You don't
want to be immoral and bohemian, do you?'</p>

<p>With the utmost sweetness, like an indignant wren, Bethel
explained, 'How do I know? I don't know what you have to do to be
immoral, but of course if I have to, to be a great actress, why
then I have to. Don't you see?'</p>

<p>'This is awful! I never heard anything like it! You don't know
what you're talking about!'</p>

<p>'I do so know what I'm talking about!'</p>

<p>'You do not know what you're talking about.'</p>

<p>'Oh, shut up!'</p>

<p>'Shut up yourself, telling me to shut up!'</p>

<p>'Oh, Charley, I'm sorry if I was rude.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that's okay. But I don't think you had ought to be
immoral, just the same.'</p>

<p>'Well, maybe I won't have to. And honestly I like loganberry
juice much better than beer. Gee!'</p>

<p><br>
Upon Bethel's solicitation, Alva Prindle did go to <i>The
Silver Cord</i> Wednesday matinee. And she hated it. Bethel met
her at the Rex Pharmacy for her report.</p>

<p>'It was so talky!' Alva complained into her cherry sundae.
'Maybe some folks might like it, but what I say is, it don't hold
your attention, like a movie.'</p>

<p>'Twice as much!'</p>

<p>'It did not! There wasn't anything happening. Not even a
penthouse or a machine-gun. All talk!'</p>

<p>'Alva, you just wait till I get to be an actress&mdash;'</p>

<p>'So you're still going to be an actress!'</p>

<p>'I certainly am. And I'm going to talk on the stage&mdash;oh,
about everything&mdash;about patriotism, and love&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why, Beth-el Mer-ri-day!'</p>

<p>'&mdash;and why a person feels religious&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It would be awfully improper to talk about religion, right up
there on the stage. They never do, in the movies. People hate
it.'</p>

<p>'But I will&mdash;honestly I will. And I'm going to get up a
dramatic society in high school next year.'</p>

<p>'That'd be kind of fun.'</p>

<p>'It'll be kind of hard work, too, let me tell you! There's not
going to be any fooling around when I get up a play!'</p>

<p>'Oh, there isn't, eh! You think you know so much! I bet you
don't even know what a stage door is!'</p>

<p>'I do so!'</p>

<p>'How do you know?' scoffed Alva.</p>

<p>'I read about it.'</p>

<p>'That's a heck of a way to learn about things&mdash;to read
about them! But I bet you didn't dare go to the stage door at the
Crystal.'</p>

<p><i>'You</i> didn't?'</p>

<p>'I certainly did!'</p>

<p>'Alva! And you saw the actors, close?'</p>

<p>'I certainly did. And I got old McDermid's autograph, and
Elsie's and Irma's.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you didn't bother them for their <i>autographs!'</i></p>

<p>'I certainly did! What would you talk to actors for, except to
get their autographs?'</p>

<p>'Tell me, Alva&mdash;oh, tell me! Is Mr. McDermid as handsome
as he is on the stage?'</p>

<p>'Him? Old Mac? No! He's maybe forty-five, and he wears a
wig.'</p>

<p>'Oh no! Oh, darling! It couldn't be! Oh, not forty-five!
Almost as old as my father! And a wig! But I don't care. I think
Mr. McDermid is just&mdash;uh&mdash;adorable.'</p>

<p>'You do, eh?' Alva had regained all her Hollywood superiority.
'Well, let me tell you, baby, Mac's married to that red-headed
little dumbbell, Elsie Krall. You better stay off.'</p>

<p>'Oh no! How do you know he is?'</p>

<p>'The stage doorman told me. And Mac treats Elsie terrible, the
poor kid.'</p>

<p>'Do you know what I think?' said Bethel. 'What?'</p>

<p>'I think you're a liar. You're like that mother in the play.
Good-bye!'</p>

<p>This from the meek Bethel who, year by year, had let Alva
snatch her lollypop, her scooter, her beaux.</p>

<p>She waited till no [<i>sic</i>] Wednesday, the second week of
the McDermid company's season, when they played <i>Dulcy</i> with
Elsie Krall as the <i>ing&eacute;nue</i> Angela. She had to know
about Alva's strictures on her favourite gods. She was there on
Monday evening, not embarrassed now, and when her last agitated
laugh was finished, she marched down the alley to the stage door,
rather wishing that Alva could see how professionally she went
about it.</p>

<p>The stage entrance was at the back of the theatre, on a
rotting balcony overhanging Swan Creek, now a sewerlike trickle
between muddy banks, but once, when Sladesbury was a country
town, a handsome stream. She was annoyed by the crowd of three
girls with autograph albums, but she wrapped herself in an
imaginary cloak&mdash;black lined with crimson&mdash;and waited,
mysterious under an arch in Venice.</p>

<p>The magic beings were coming out of fairyland, and Bethel knew
that she was right about them.</p>

<p>Caryl McDermid&mdash;yes, he must be forty-five or
more&mdash;quite an old man&mdash;but that certainly was no wig,
that lovely mane thick as horsehair, and he smiled so easily,
took in the autograph hunters with his gaily curved lips, his
innocent eyes. Elsie was on his arm, clinging, adoring. And there
were Irma Wheat, whose smiling made her more beautiful than on
the stage, and the terrible Maggie Sample, the overwhelming
character woman, who was a pillar of ice.</p>

<p>Bethel tried to resist, but as these four walked through the
alley, down Charter Oak Avenue, with its red neon lights over
bowling alleys and caf&eacute;s, she followed them, glad that
they really were so beautiful... even if she did notice that
Mr. McDermid's elbows were shiny, and Elsie's heels worn down. To
what glamorous party were they going? Would they meet professors
and newspapermen from great Hartford? Was Mrs. Beaseley Payne's
sixteen-cylinder Cadillac waiting to whisk them to splendours at
her pine Gothic castle on Bucks Hill?</p>

<p>Her idols were turning into Boze's Beanery... they were
casually sitting down at a long marble-topped table... they
were ordering hamburgers and flapjacks and coffee... and
Bethel heard Elsie addressing McDermid: 'Oh, darling, I think I'm
stinking in <i>Dulcy.</i> I wish to God I could act,' and heard
Maggie Sample's snappish, 'So do I&mdash;wish you could!'</p>

<p>Bethel was sitting at the other end of that Beanery table, too
scared to move, her voice breaking as she ordered, 'P-please, a
chocolate &eacute;clair and a g-glass of m-milk.'</p>

<p><br>
There was an elegance about Caryl McDermid that was hard to
define. His suit, of soft blue flannel, was glassy at the seams;
he wore a commonplace soft white shirt and solid blue tie; but
there was an unwrinkled firmness and smoothness about his cheeks
and chin; and the lapel of his coat curved as though he had
magnificent shoulders. His smile was consuming; it took in
everybody, as though he loved them yet realized all their
absurdities.</p>

<p>Elsie Krall, his wife&mdash;the child must have been thirty
years younger than he&mdash;was frail copper and ivory; the
statuette of a stilled dancer; but her eyes were not alive like
McDermid's. They rested always on him, gratefully; and
imploringly on the bitter Miss Maggie Sample.</p>

<p>They were real gods, as Bethel had known they must be.</p>

<p>She was not shocked by the undivinity of their chatter.
Probably she really had the professional stage virus in her
system.</p>

<p>'Maggie,' said McDermid, 'I wish you wouldn't wave your arms
so, when you make your cross in your scene with Forbes, in
two.'</p>

<p>'Elsie, listen darling, don't yell so when you say to me, "It
was just the most romantic thing that ever happened in the
world". Can't you underplay it a little? <i>Dulcy</i> is a
comedy, you know!'</p>

<p>'Say, did you see that Ramona Snyder has been cast for the
name part in <i>Stop It, Rosika?</i> They go into rehearsal in
August,' said Irma Wheat.</p>

<p>'And is she lousy! I bet they don't pay her a hundred and
fifty, and no run-of-the-play contract,' said Maggie Sample.</p>

<p>'Don't mention money. I don't know what we got a box office
for,' said McDermid.</p>

<p>It was the catsup bottle that introduced Bethel to them,
though this did not surprise her, since she loved the romantic
catsup label with its legend: 'Made only of fresh ripe tomatoes,
onion, salt, and rare and imported spices from the Orient.'</p>

<p>'Please pass us the catsup,' said McDermid to her.</p>

<p>'Oh&mdash;yes.' It was a convulsive effort, but Bethel got
out, 'I&mdash;I loved the play to-night.'</p>

<p>'Oh, did you, honest? Was I terrible? I just can't seem to do
these swell society girls,' wailed Elsie Krall.</p>

<p>For all her loyalty, Bethel had confusedly felt that Elsie
really had been fairly 'terrible' on the stage; awkward and
bouncing. But she lied like a gentleman. Then&mdash;oh, she
<i>had</i> to know; it was her whole life&mdash;Bethel
blurted:</p>

<p>'How can you get to be an actress?'</p>

<p>Elsie stared. She looked as though she were asking the same
question herself. McDermid smiled. Irma Wheat said, 'God only
knows! But what do you want to go on the stage for, anyway?'</p>

<p>Maggie Sample was like Lady Macbeth in one of her moments of
exasperation with her husband, as she protested to Bethel, 'Do
you want to starve? I've been on the stage thirty years, and here
I am in this flop of a stock company in the sticks&mdash;'</p>

<p>McDermid smiled. 'Hey, hey!' was all he said.</p>

<p>'&mdash;and next fall I'll be lucky if I get a job as a kosher
ham sandwich in a Number Two Company of <i>Abie's Irish Rose.</i>
When you grow up, child,' and she smiled at Bethel, 'you try to
squirm into prison, or get a nice job hustling hash, or even get
married, or anything to avoid going on the stage.'</p>

<p>'You know you'd rather act than eat, Maggie,' said
McDermid.</p>

<p>'That's only because I never get a chance to eat.'</p>

<p>'Now don't discourage this young lady. She has wide-awake
eyes. Maybe she's felt the call to the stage.</p>

<br>


<p class="verse">

'Shabby and crouched and shockingly fed,<br>

Whistling, he sits on his unmade bed<br>

In the airless bedroom down the hall,<br>

And smiles because he had heard the call<br>

(At Equity minimum!) back to the stage&mdash;<br>

Rusty beggar or golden page&mdash;<br>

Claudius, Hamlet, or Player King&mdash;<br>

The glory that flutters wing on wing&mdash;'</p>

<br>

<p>'Oh, you and your Lambs Club poetry!' Miss Wheat scolded at
McDermid, as she arose, with the sardonic Maggie Sample. 'You're
going to be telling this poor, deluded kid that it's better to
climb up on the steam pipes in a dressing room in order to keep
your feet out of the water when the toilet has busted, and to sit
up all night learning seventy-five sides, at sixty bucks a week,
closing on Saturday, than it is to work in a grocery store. Me,
that've got it on Gloria Swanson from ankles to consonants,
playing in a dump behind a factory in Connecticut. You can keep
it. Caryl, darling, if you weren't my boss, and if I didn't love
you distractedly, I'd tip you off that you're as screwy as a
Russian director.'</p>

<p>'No. He's not bright enough,' said Miss Sample.</p>

<p>Exeunt, Irma and Maggie.</p>

<p>'It isn't true, what she said. It is fun to be on the stage,
isn't it?' Bethel begged of Elsie.</p>

<p>'Yes, I guess it is. I don't know yet. I been acting such a
little time.' Elsie looked troubled. 'I was waiting on table in
Teneriffe Junction, in Iowa, when Mr. McDermid came along and
married me. He's been so sweet&mdash;yes, you have, too,
Caryl&mdash;but I guess he gets kind of impatient&mdash;oh, I
don't blame you, darling. It's so kind of hard for me to
understand why a lot of the characters act like they do. Take
like last week; why did Hester&mdash;Did you see me in <i>Silver
Cord</i> then?'</p>

<p>'Oh <i>yes!'</i></p>

<p>'Oh, I'm glad. But I don't guess I was very good. But why did
Hester fall for a softie like Robin? Honest, it's so kind of
hard, all this acting. But I love the travel. I collect
things&mdash;from department stores. We only been married a year,
and I got an Austrian peasant costume from Marshall Field's and a
pair of python shoes from Halle's, in Cleveland, and a brazeer
from Sicily, all hand-embroidered, in Columbus, and all kinds of
things. But I do get scared&mdash;all those hellhounds in the
audience coughing!'</p>

<p>McDermid said hastily, 'Elsie is about as new to it as you
are, my dear, but you'll both make good. And&mdash;How do you get
a chance to act? Well, first you get all the training you can.
<i>Training!</i> Act wherever you can&mdash;even if it's in the
barn. And then get God to pass you some good luck. That's all I
know. And it's worth it. Even if you aren't much good&mdash;and
me, I guess I'm probably just the run-of-the-mill ham&mdash;even
so, when you've been creating a human being, and living in him,
then the rest of the world outside the theatre, with all its
fussing about houses and motor cars and taxes, seems pretty
shabby. Acting&mdash;it's a heightening of life. I guess we're
all stage-struck, us old troupers, no matter how we kick.'</p>

<p>'And do you think maybe I could do it?'</p>

<p>McDermid studied Bethel, rubbed his nose, droned, 'Maybe
so&mdash;maybe so. Let's see. Get up and walk to the door and
back.' When she returned, his appraisal was warmer. 'You're
pretty graceful, and you have some spirit in you, and a rather
warm voice, for such a thin kid, and you watch things&mdash;you
see how things are done&mdash;I was watching you watch us. Yes, I
think you probably can act!'</p>

<p>It was her accolade.</p>

<p>As they went out, Elsie whispered to her, 'Come see me in my
dressing-room.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'd be pleased!'</p>

<p>'And we can play with my doll. I got such a funny
doll&mdash;so long-legged and so sweet. I've never told a soul
but you that I still play with it&mdash;not even Mac&mdash;Mr.
McDermid. I don't know anybody in Sladesbury&mdash;they all seem
so grownup and busy here. Will you come see me?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'd love to!'</p>

<p>'Come next week then.'</p>

<p>'Yes!'</p>

<p>Bethel was intoxicated with the friendship of this, her first
real actress. But she never saw Elsie's dressing-room. The
McDermid stock company closed, that Saturday night, and she did
not meet Caryl McDermid again till years afterward, when he told
her of Elsie Krall's dying of pneumonia in a hospital in
Hollywood, looking bewildered and a little frightened, and
clasping to the end a long-legged, armless doll.</p>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<p class="first">'YOU know Gale Amory&mdash;she's such a grand
girl, you'd never expect to find her in a hen college. Well, she
was to play the husband's part in <i>Doll's House,</i> you know,
Ibsen, it was the senior-class play, and she came to rehearsal
all made up like a man, I mean, double-breasted blue suit of her
brother's, and she's so feminine, everybody laughed their head
off. So, of course, they all began to cut up and laugh and kid
their lines, and the girl who played Dr. Rank, she ran out and
came back with a burnt-cork moustache, and of course, I mean that
simply convulsed them, and she said in a deep voice, I mean, it
was a serious line from the play, but she burlesqued it and she
said, "At the next masquerade, I shall be invisible", and
everybody simply howled! And then Gale goes out and puts on a
moustache, too!</p>

<p>'Why, even Miss Bickling&mdash;Professor Bickling, who teaches
Drama, Poetry, and the Novel and that coaches the plays&mdash;of
course I mean she's deadly serious about art and culture and
she's so fat and respectable and eyeglassy, but she got to
laughing as hard as anybody, and it was terribly hard to go on
with the rehearsal, but then it was such fun and after all,
wasn't that the real reason for doing the play&mdash;to have fun,
the last few weeks of those long four years of college?</p>

<p>'In fact the only person that beefed about it was Bethel
Merriday; she was playing Nora, so probably she felt like a star
or a prima donna or something. Beth is a sweet girl, even if she
does get so daydreamy, and she's not a grind, and she certainly
does share her candy and introduce her dates around. But for some
reason or other, she takes plays so doggone seriously. And she
turned on Gale and she had a regular fit of temperament and she
screamed, "Will you take off that fool moustache and quit trying
to play <i>Room Service?</i> You haven't got the slightest idea
yet whether, as the husband, you're supposed to be a stupid,
decent book-keeper, or a sadistic stuffed shirt, or what, and
here dress rehearsal is only a week away!"</p>

<p>'Well! You did have to admire Bethel, mostly so quiet, like a
sparrow, standing up to that big Gale Amory, but still&mdash;</p>

<p>'Poor Miss Bickling looked so uncomfortable. Of course she was
supposed to be coaching the play, but all she ever said to any of
the actors was, "I don't know&mdash;maybe if it feels awkward to
stand there so long, you better move around a little, and make
some gestures&mdash;that's it: try to think up some gestures that
will look interesting", or "Maybe you better speak a little
louder". So when Bethel butted in like this, Miss Bickling was
embarrassed as the dickens. She was kind of fond of Bethel,
because she always read poetry aloud so lovely, but of course she
couldn't stand a tantrum like this, and she said, "Bethel, dear,
I know you're very interested in drama, but after all, this is
college, and we want to act like ladies and not like paid
actresses, don't we!"</p>

<p>'"No, I don't," Bethel said.</p>

<p>'Imagine!'</p>

<p><br>
It was seven years&mdash;or seven excited moments&mdash;since
Bethel had talked to the Caryl McDermids. The time was May 19th,
1938; twelve days before she would become twenty-two, three and a
half weeks before she would graduate from Point Royal College for
Women, in Connecticut. To-night she would be starring in <i>A
Doll's House,</i> but this afternoon, at the panicky, hastily
called extra rehearsal, it did not look as though there would be
any senior-class play whatever.</p>

<p>The dress rehearsal, last night, had lasted till two a.m., and
it had been scandalous. Miss Gale Amory, as Torvald Helmer, did
not know her part, and whenever the prompt girl&mdash;a terrified
and outlawed freshman, crouched on a chair, almost hanging her
head inside the window in the right wall&mdash;was able to find
her place in the script and to throw the line to Miss Amory in an
edgy whisper, Miss Amory screamed, <i>'Please!</i> I can't
<i>hear</i> you'. Nils Krogstad did know her, or his, part, but
she wasn't sure whether she was a comic villain who ought to
close one eye and tap her nose, or a Russian victim of fate who
talked deep down and inaudibly. She tried it both ways.</p>

<p>The amateur stagehands had dropped one of the flats for the
rear wall and torn a gash, and not till the dress rehearsal had
anyone discovered that the music of the third-act tarantella,
conveyed by an aged phonograph, could not be heard in the second
row.</p>

<p>Bethel was better than that. She did know her part, and she
could be heard, and she had some notion that Nora was an amiable
little housewife who had never been trained by responsibility.
Whether she shouted too loud and wrung her hands too much is a
matter of opinion, but just now the appalled Professor Miss
Bickling looked on Bethel as a combination of Nazimova and Max
Reinhardt, and it may be that our Bethel, just for the day, felt
that way herself.</p>

<p>This afternoon, five hours before the performance, they were,
with glue and frenzy, repairing the irreparable. Six people were
cuing Miss Amory all at once. Miss Bickling was urging Krogstad
to take it easy, and Bethel was begging Krogstad to take it
hard.</p>

<p>The rest of the time, Bethel was standing absent-eyed in
corners, muttering
'Noyesterdayitwasparticularlynoticeableyouseepausehesuffersfromad
readfulillness'. The college engineer&mdash;a male, and no
artist&mdash;was patching the ripped canvas of the flat, and one
of the girl musicians was practising a Spanish dance on a hastily
imported piano, so placed behind scenes that no one could reach
the dressing-rooms without banging her legs on the keyboard. The
pianist, though she would not be seen by the audience at all,
already had such stage fright that her music sounded like
terrified teeth.</p>

<p>In the midst of this merriment Miss Bickling received a
message, beamed, and called Bethel aside, with 'What are your
plans for the summer, Beth?'</p>

<p>'I guess I'll just stay home.'</p>

<p>'But you still want to try and go on the stage, in the
fall?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Anyway, I'll tackle all the managers on Broadway. They
might give me a chance as walk-on.'</p>

<p>'What's a walk-on?'</p>

<p>'It's where you walk&mdash;<i>on.'</i></p>

<p>'I see. Well, of course I think being a librarian or getting
married or going to Switzerland is more educated than being an
actress, but still&mdash;You'd like to act in one of the summer
theatres, wouldn't you?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, but I wouldn't have a chance.'</p>

<p>'You know, I tell all my girls that I look after their careers
just as much as I do their conjunctions, and I've used all my
"pull", as you girls call it, and to-night, right in the
audience, will be two ve-ry celebrated proprietors of summer
theatres in southern Connecticut&mdash;Mr. Roscoe Valentine and
Mr. Jerome Jordan O'Toole.'</p>

<p>'Oh dear!' said Bethel.</p>

<p><br>
At dinner in Bemis Hall, before the play, it was dismaying to
Bethel that none of the girls were nervous and taut like herself;
six hundred hearty young women, gulping chicken hash, clattering
their forks, yawning, shrieking about biology and the boys, and
making up their lips; carefree and pink and scornful. How could
she make them believe in Nora to-night?</p>

<p>She ate her pudding (cornstarch pudding with canned
raspberries) as slowly as possible, to put off the terrifying
hour of going to Assembly Hall, their temporary theatre. She
tried to smile cordially while the girl beside her related with
vulgar cheerfulness her experiences with a canoe, a portable
radio and a C.C.N.Y. man. They were precisely such experiences as
the girl's mother had had with a canoe, a banjo and a Princeton
man, and to Bethel they seemed antiquated compared with the woes
of the Nora who had first slammed her door sixty years ago.</p>

<p>She wanted to escape from these chatterers, but as she slipped
out of Bemis Hall, a LaSalle drove up, and in it were her father
and mother and brother and Charley Hatch.</p>

<p>'We thought we'd drive down and surprise you and see you act!'
cried each of the four, in turn&mdash;so smiling, so sweet, so
devastating.</p>

<p>'Oh, that's dandy! I'll see you right after the show. Come
backstage!' she chirruped, while she was quaking that it was
going to be bad enough to forget her lines and make herself
ridiculous before the jeering students and two summer-theatre
managers, without giving herself away to her trusting family.</p>

<p>She cried for a good two minutes in her dressing-room, which
until one hour ago had been the consultation room of the
Professor of Pedagogy and Vocational Psychology; she rolled her
head on her dressing-table, which had been the professor's desk,
covered with graphs about the relationship of coffee drinking at
lunch to the three-p.m. sale of (a) automobile tyres, (b) Dopey
Dolls, (c) advertising-column-inches in trade journals. She did
not belong with graphs or anything else that was new and brisk
and important in A.D. 1938.</p>

<p>She was pale enough always; now she felt herself funereal; and
as she shakily started to make up, she plastered her cheeks with
a vermilion base and felt better and braver about it. She knew
nothing about make-up, but then, neither did the college
theatrical dictator, Miss Bickling, who would have felt it rather
low to let Ophelia associate with blue lining salve. The one
thing Bethel was convinced of was that you always use heavy
grease paint and always extend your eyebrows with burnt cork
(which you don't). She was proud of slapping her face with powder
and getting the powder all over a huge apron she had borrowed
from the Bemis Hall kitchen.</p>

<p>While she made up, she stared now and then, like a solemn
child, at the portrait of Professor Maria Martin Mitz being
vocationally psychological in cap and gown.</p>

<p>When Bethel was done, she looked like an extravagantly painted
doll, with very red cheeks, very long black brows, and a very
white little nose absurd in the middle of the sunset. Later
to-night, on the stage, the effect would not be improved by
lighting that was a ferocious illumination by spots, with no
gelatins to soften the glare. But nobody minded. The college
dramatic enthusiasts&mdash;if they were going to have make-up,
they wanted it made <i>up,</i> and no nonsense.</p>

<p>To Bethel and the other members of the cast, Professor Miss
Bickling was of the greatest help. She came in every two minutes
and patted their shoulders and cooed, 'I know you're going to be
just wonderful, dear, and be sure now and don't forget your
lines'. This was a mild form of what was known in Point Royal
College as a 'pep talk', and it had, on writhing amateur
actresses, the effect of so irritating them that they were sure
now and did forget their lines.</p>

<p>Despite this balk, Bethel was much clearer than at dress
rehearsal as to how she saw Nora's shrill little character. She
had asked Miss Bickling about it all, and the benevolent
professor, who kept culture as she would have kept a tearoom, had
purred, 'You mean you want to break down the character? Oh, leave
all that psychological fussing to the left-wing theatre. It
hasn't anything to do with Art. Just be careful to say the lines
as the author wrote them&mdash;only, you must say them
beautifully, of course&mdash;lines like "Never to see the
children again&mdash;oh, that black icy water"&mdash;and then you
can't go wrong.'</p>

<p>But, in rebellion, Bethel had tried to think out by herself
what Nora really was; what she herself was, as Nora; and having
heard the whole cast and Miss Bickling agree that Nora was a very
nice young married woman who suffered from an unimaginative
husband, Bethel was agitated to find that she considered Nora a
fool, in expecting a banker husband to regard forgery as just a
little joke between friends, and none too kindhearted a fool, in
boasting of her domestic security to the desolate Christina.</p>

<p>If this was true, fretted Bethel, wouldn't it be much more
explosive if, in the last act, Nora were more aware of her own
childishness than of her husband's stuffiness?</p>

<p>'I'll do her that way!' exulted Bethel. 'It'll be
tremendous.'</p>

<p>But she had the grace to jeer, 'Of course there is the little
matter of your being such an amateur that the audience won't know
whether you see Nora as a gun-moll or an abbess!'</p>

<p><br>
The cast took turns, feeling ever so professional, in peeping
out through a hole in the curtain at the audience, which was
brutally cheerful in not having to remember lines: cynical
fellow-students in bright sweaters, officially cheerful
professors, timid parents. Bethel could not find her own family,
and felt abandoned, and she could not make out any two men who
might be the fate-laden summer-theatre directors, Messrs.
Valentine and O'Toole... Oh, what of it, what of it, what
<i>of</i> it! They'd laugh at her feeble Nora anyway, and she'd
have to go home... maybe marry Charley Hatch... no, she
wouldn't... oh, why <i>not?</i></p>

<p>She stood outside the double-door entrance, ready to go on at
the beginning of the play. She was a small, resigned figure in a
bobtailed Victorian jacket, a small bustle, a skinny fur and a
prim little hat. For a moment, in panic, certain to be jeered by
the audience out there, the fiendish demanding Audience, the
AUDIENCE, she had been certain that she couldn't remember a
single line. Now she was too numb to care. If the curtain would
just go up, so she could get it over! Did the student orchestra
have to go on showing off all evening? She hated the sour and
trailing air of <i>'Weis' du wie gut'.</i> She concentrated on
the wheat-coloured canvas and the flimsy crossbar of the
backstage side of the double doors. She wondered in what previous
play they had been used; what the stencilled DL7 on the canvas
meant.</p>

<p>Then she was jarred almost into screaming by Miss Bickling's
loving and altogether devastating pat on her shoulder. Then
silence from in front&mdash;no music, no rustle of audience.
Something gone wrong? Then the stage manager's confident voice,
'Curtain's going up, Beth', and instantly, propelled by a power
not her own, Bethel-Nora was scampering on the stage and saying
cheerfully, her voice as steady as her hands were jittery, 'Hide
the Christmas tree carefully, Ellen'.</p>

<p>She was Nora; she was an actress; she was born.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<p class="first">BETHEL played the first two acts in a still and
competent fury. Gale Amory, her stage husband, was the creator of
the fury, and the cause was not Gale's incompetence, but her
extreme competence in faking.</p>

<p>Perceiving that she would never be able to remember her lines,
the bonny Gale decided to treat it as a joke and to share the
joke with the audience. So whenever she stopped to listen to the
prompter, she smiled at her friends down there like a tooth-brush
advertisement&mdash;if Gale wasn't strong in intellect, she was
extraordinary in whiteness of teeth&mdash;and her pals wriggled
with affectionate entertainment and muttered that this was the
first time that Ibsen had ever been amusing.</p>

<p>For the first time, when Gale burlesqued her line 'My little
bird must never do that again' and got almost as good a laugh as
if she had kicked a baby or fallen on her nose, Bethel had enough
wholesome ham in her to be tempted to join in the fun, but she
angrily rejected it, and fought through, making herself as much
the kindly, half-baked, tortured Nora as she could. She was too
busy keeping up pace to notice whether she herself was good or
not, while she was on the stage, but in her dressing-room between
acts she had time to decide that she hadn't been too bad.</p>

<p>She had felt authority. But not till her great last scene of
breaking with her husband did she feel inspired.</p>

<p>Then (she believed) a great new spirit filled her, and she was
Nora, she was all Noras, all women who are bewildered by the
brutal and incomprehensible whims of stranger-husbands. As though
she were hammering nails she pounded at Torvald&mdash;at the Gale
Amory now a little embarrassed and much less sportive&mdash;'I
believe that before all else I am a human being, just as much as
you are&mdash;or at least that I should try to become one.' She
raised her voice, raised her arms; a priestess before the altar;
the priestess of the new cult of the awakening women. 'Henceforth
I can't be satisfied with what most people say, and what is in
books. I must think things out for myself, and try to get clear
about them.'</p>

<p>The applause came crashing; and at the end, when she slammed
the door, she felt that she was not closing a door but opening
one on life... first nights on Broadway, velvet-hung first
nights in London, famous authors with scripts, and a terrace in
Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where she would sit being gaily
learned with Lunt and Fontanne and Noel Coward and Helen Hayes
and Katharine Cornell and Orson Welles.</p>

<p>She scampered to her dressing-room&mdash;a complete success,
after eight curtain calls.</p>

<p><br>
It was the first dressing-room reception she had ever held. It
was a whirlpool of beaming eyes, handshakes, voices saying that
she was 'wonderful', that she 'had a great future if she should
ever care to accept a position on the stage', that 'she had been
much the best thing in the play&mdash;much!' She wasn't deflated
even by the fact that from next door, from Gale Amory's
dressing-room&mdash;which tomorrow would again be the Domestic
Science and Dietetics Seminar&mdash;she could hear 'You were much
the best thing in the play, Gale&mdash;you were
wonderful&mdash;you were so <i>human!'</i></p>

<p>Bethel felt that she was acting an actress in the
dressing-room rather competently&mdash;the pleased modesty, the
clinging smile. In the midst of people she could make out her
family, and see Charley Hatch looking at her as wistfully as a
lost lone dog, Miss Bickling coming down from her synthetic ivory
tower to say firmly, 'You did splendidly, and I was very angry
with Gale for clowning, and I'm going in and tell her so', and a
whole puppy-rollick of classmates, mocking, 'You certainly showed
up the husbands, Beth!'</p>

<p>Miss Bickling cleared them all out. Mr. O'Toole of the Dory
Playhouse was waiting; Mr. O'Toole had to get back to New York
that night.</p>

<p>So, in glory, Bethel met her first producer.</p>

<p><br>
Mr. Jerome Jordan O'Toole, at forty-five, had directed seven
Broadway plays&mdash;two of them surprisingly
successful&mdash;and for twenty years before that had acted
chauffeurs, tramps, detectives and such other examples of what
playwrights, peering out of their clubs, regard as the Common
People. He was Yankee-Irish, from Bangor. He was tall and dry and
sunken-cheeked; hard and exact and honest. In summer he was
managing director of the Dory Playhouse, at Hardscrabble Beach,
Connecticut, which was classed as one of the dozen summer
theatres that were competent and professional.</p>

<p>Bethel, heart fluttering, didn't know whether to sit still, as
a confident actress, doing something or other with cold cream and
Kleenex, or to stand humbly in the presence of power, and before
she had time to figure out the interpretation of her role, Jerry
O'Toole was in the doorway, like Abraham Lincoln in tennis
costume, and she had popped to her feet and stood blushing.</p>

<p>Miss Bickling crowed, 'This is our lovely little heroine, Miss
Merriday.'</p>

<p>O'Toole shook Bethel's hand with a croaking 'The performance
was very interesting' that was more completely a nothing than
anything Bethel had ever heard.</p>

<p>'Was I as bad as that?' she begged.</p>

<p>'No. You weren't bad. Of course the others were all of them
excellent&mdash;splendid.'</p>

<p>'Oh-uh!' of bliss from Miss Bickling, and a diminutive 'Oh' of
chagrin from Bethel.</p>

<p>'They weren't trying to act at all, and they did that very
well. They managed to turn Ibsen into a farce, and I guess that
requires a college education&mdash;I never had one. But you, my
dear&mdash;' He held Bethel's hand in his long wide brown hand,
which felt comforting. 'You were trying to act, so I'll
compliment you by applying professional standards, and by them,
you were pretty bad. You showed that someday you may be able to
act, if you ever get any training. But you were pretty bad! You
overplayed everything. You made Nora sound like a kitchen
mechanic scrapping with the iceman. But you were alive.'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;' She did not know that she was copying his
hitching style. 'Then I guess there's no chance for me to get
into your summer theatre this season?'</p>

<p>He gave what seemed to her a curious answer: 'Not till you've
been lucky enough to fail a few times. Then come see me, my dear.
Good luck!'</p>

<p>He was gone; a broad-shouldered, gaunt man who moved
easily.</p>

<p>Miss Bickling had scarce got through protesting to Bethel that
she was disappointed, that Mr. O'Toole had proved to be nothing
but a Broadway Commercialist and a Heartless Algonquin Wit, when
they were interrupted by the pleasant exuberance of Mr. Roscoe
Valentine, who always carried his own private sun.</p>

<p><br>
Mr. Jerome O'Toole's summer stock company, the Dory Playhouse,
and the Nutmeg Players, conducted by Mr. Roscoe Valentine at
Point Grampion, Connecticut, were both on the shore between New
Haven and New London, twenty miles apart, and the feeling between
them was that of caviare for butterscotch sundae. Roscoe
Valentine, aged fifty, was a man composed, except for his brains
and his indignant red eyes, entirely of powder puffs. In winter
he was a Bostonian and a scholar, editor of a magazine of the
arts called <i>The Spiral,</i> and director of The Spiral
Theatre, where Back Bay met the backwoods in one-act
glorifications of a proletariat that they actually hated and
misunderstood.</p>

<p>Bethel had never seen a man like this: so squashy, so
giggling, so spiteful, yet so calmly understanding of everything
a woman thought before she finished thinking it. His hand felt
like a cold wet piece of oiled silk, as he held hers and
bubbled:</p>

<p>'Splendid, my dear! You gave an entirely new conception of the
role of Nora.'</p>

<p>'Do you hear that?' said Miss Bickling.</p>

<p>'Oh, thank you!' said Bethel.</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;oh, indeed yes,' said Mr. Valentine.</p>

<p>'Mr. Jerome O'Toole told Bethel that she overacted,' said Miss
Bickling.</p>

<p>'Jerry O'Toole must have been reading a book again. It always
takes him that way. One time, he was quite a good stage manager.
He knows all about carpentry, but don't you think, my dears, it's
just on the too-too side when he talks about the social drama?
No, my poppet, don't you worry. You did Nora with real
&eacute;clat. So beautifully fallible.'</p>

<p>Bethel didn't know what it was all about. She never would be
adept at doing word tricks. She looked at Valentine like a
shivering kitten, and Miss Bickling carried on for her.</p>

<p>'That's so kind of you. I'm sure Bethel and I appreciate it a
lot.' (Bethel wasn't at all sure.) 'Now she feels that she has a
calling to the stage, and after to-night I'm sure she has, and
we're wondering if you could make a place for her in your summer
theatre?'</p>

<p>'Why, I think perhaps I could.'</p>

<p>'Oh, how gorgeous!' said Miss Bickling.</p>

<p>'Oh!' said Bethel.</p>

<p>Valentine sat down facing the back of a wooden chair. And that
was the first time, outside of the movies, that Bethel had ever
seen this posture, and she noted and put away the fact that it
made his fat knees prominent and very silly.</p>

<p>He spoke youthfully:</p>

<p>'Now as we're just three girls together, let's let our hair
down and be frank. You know there's no box office at all in the
summer theatres. Even a roundneck like O'Toole can't make it
pay&mdash;in fact, if you want to know, I make more than he does!
But even so&mdash;And for the apprentices, such as you'll be,
Miss Merriday, I have simply splendid teachers, with practical
lessons in voice and eurythmics, and the chance to appear in my
plays with famous actors. So I'm compelled to charge each student
actor two hundred and seventy-five dollars for the ten-week
season, and fifteen dollars a week for room and
board&mdash;really below cost. Do you think you could dig up all
that fabulous wealth&mdash;four hundred and twenty-five
dollars?'</p>

<p>And to Bethel it <i>was</i> fabulous wealth. 'I don't know.
I'll try to. I'll try so hard.'</p>

<p>'When can you find out?'</p>

<p>'My family are waiting outside. I'll see them now.'</p>

<p><br>
The senior Merridays and Charley looked small and rustic in
the stretches of the Assembly Hall stage, gazing distrustfully at
a red-headed co-ed in shorts who was moving scenery. Bethel flew
up to them, her dress three-quarters buttoned, her hair
uncombed.</p>

<p>'What is it&mdash;what <i>is</i> it, dear?' urged her
mother.</p>

<p>'Anything gone wrong?' her brother demanded, rather gladly, as
though he were going to have a chance to hit someone and restore
his own superiority in this over-feminine maze.</p>

<p>'Oh no, it's just&mdash;Daddy, I can be in a summer theatre
this summer, with real actors, and then be ready for a job on the
stage this fall, in New York, if you can let me have four hundred
and twenty-five dollars for the lessons. But honestly, I'll pay
it all back, as soon as I get a job&mdash;'</p>

<p>Her father fretted, 'Well, finances are pretty tight, just
now, and I had hoped you'd begin bringing in a little before
long. And I guess I don't understand girls now. When I was young,
girls were glad to stay home and marry some nice fellow, but now
seems like they all want to go off some place and be actresses or
fly to Australia. No, I don't understand it but&mdash;Yes. We'll
fix it somehow. My girl's going to have her chance!'</p>

<p>'I don't <i>need</i> a new Chevvy this year,' said her
brother.</p>

<p>For years, Bethel was to be at a disadvantage when young
actresses explained that they had the most interesting excuses
for every lapse, because their parents and brothers had been so
unimaginative, unsympathetic and generally so American.</p>

<p><br>
As she went to bed, she exulted that she was a real employed
actress now; that in just a month she would be at the Point
Grampion school. But there was something irascible lurking behind
the bland joy, and she dared to drag it out:</p>

<p>'I <i>did</i> overdo Nora. It wasn't good enough. I wasn't
good enough!'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<p class="first">ALL those two days at home, June 15th and 16th,
1938, before she went off to the summer theatre at Grampion, she
earnestly enacted the role of a girl saying good-bye to childhood
and to every loved spot that her infancy knew: the cement garage,
the pergola on which the Concord grapevines were always rather
dry, the basement playroom with the tracks of the electric
railroad which she had inherited from Ben.</p>

<p>She also devoted herself to sound self-examination&mdash;she
tried to.</p>

<p>She felt, and quite guiltily, that she ought to be devoting
herself to worrying about the dispossessed Jews in Germany and
Poland, the share croppers in Oklahoma; and, if not doing
anything about them&mdash;for obviously she never would do
anything about them&mdash;at least showing herself a
right-thinking liberal by hourly agonizing, 'Oh, isn't there
something I <i>can</i> do?' But she had to admit that what she
wanted was much simpler: she just wanted to act.</p>

<p>She felt guilty because none of her life had been
conspicuously devoted to 'doing things for other people'. That
was Professor Miss Bickling's war cry and nursery ditty: 'The
greatest joy and privilege in life is doing things for other
people.' But Bethel found that she coveted dancing lessons,
fencing lessons, French lessons, piano and voice and make-up, for
herself.</p>

<p>'Well then, I guess I'm just that kind of a selfish pig,' she
lamented.</p>

<p>She was equally dissatisfied with her examination of the
status, to date, of the Heart of Bethel Merriday. She wasn't
quite sure that she had one.</p>

<p>Certainly, if the test was, as she often read, lying awake
longing for the smiles and caresses of some particular young man,
she had no heart, as yet. She liked the laughter of the young men
and their hard handshakes, but she wanted to jeer when she heard
Alva Prindle or Gale Amory yearn that some curly-headed,
pipe-flourishing young male was 'just wonderful'.</p>

<p>Alva had given up her claim to Hollywood. Already a little
stringy at twenty-three, she was devoted to the hope that one A.
Alexander Brown, a fat insurance agent with the optimism
characteristic of all insurance agents, would marry her and
provide a mink coat and a set of etched cocktail glasses. Not
toward Alva, not toward her father and mother and brother, did
Bethel feel guilty, but toward that shaggy house dog, Charley
Hatch, who had been compelled by family deficits to give up his
dreams of osteopathy for a job in the sales department of the
Flamolio Percolator Corporation.</p>

<p>'You don't think maybe you'd rather marry Charley, he'll be
making thirty-five dollars a week pretty soon, instead of going
off and taking such an awful chance on the stage, do you?' her
father had said.</p>

<p>'No!' said Bethel.</p>

<p>'Well,' said her father.</p>

<p>On her last night in Sladesbury, Charley came calling, and
they sat on the porch.</p>

<p>Americans making love have always sat on porches, except for
those who were too poor or too rich. In the house was
electricity; Mr. Merriday was reading about the tear-gas bombing
of strikers in the aeroplane industry, and Ben drawing television
diagrams; but Bethel and Charley sat on a porch in New England
and, despite all announcements that the whole world has changed
since 1920, no one could have told them from their
grandparents.</p>

<p>'Look, Bet, while we got the chance to be alone
together&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You must drive down to Grampion this summer. I'll bet it'll
be awfully cool on the shore.'</p>

<p>'I sure will, but look&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I hope there won't be a lot of mosquitoes.'</p>

<p>'I guess there won't be, but&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Isn't it funny how you can be awfully earnest and excited
about something like acting, and then some silly little thing
like mosquitoes will throw you right off!'</p>

<p>'Bet! I want to talk seriously&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Please don't.'</p>

<p>'You know how doggone fond I am of you.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I think I do, but&mdash;Oh, Charley, don't make me feel
guilty. Maybe I'm the bloodless kind of girl that can't ever
devote herself to any man. But I've got to go on. Honestly,
please believe me, I do envy the girls that can settle down to a
nice little home, but for me&mdash;prob'ly I'm crazy&mdash;it
doesn't seem good enough.'</p>

<p>'You'll never find folks that you can depend on like you can
on your home folks. In the world outside, they'll use you and
then throw you away like a worn glove.'</p>

<p>She studied Charley. His soft hair was babyish and pathetic,
yet his large, solid head seemed fatherly and protective. Was she
a fool to leave this eternal kindness?</p>

<p>She sprang up. She cried 'No, no, no, no!' and fled into the
house.</p>

<p>None of them could drive her down to Grampion that
day&mdash;Friday, June 17th&mdash;and she went by train, which
was, for one of the Modern Merridays, like travelling by
oxcart.</p>

<p>She was overwhelmed into complete guilt by Charley's farewell
present: a make-up box.</p>

<p>It was the most beautiful, most elaborate make-up box, with
every cosmetic she had ever heard of: two kinds of rouge, evening
and daytime lipstick, skin freshener, powder, mascara, nail
polish in two shades, 'Dawn Delight' and 'Faint Memory',
'nourishing cream' and the humble cold cream.</p>

<p>She cried over it. Not for three weeks did she discover that
the only things that were of the smallest use to her were the
cold cream and the empty tin box.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<p class="first">GRAMPION CENTRE was a picture-book village.
Red-fronted chain stores and crimson gasoline pumps had
enterprisingly tried to improve its quiet quality out of
existence, but Grampion was all gambrel roofs and elm trees and
white steeples and white cottages with small-paned windows, and
the quickening smell of salt marshes.</p>

<p>It was Bethel's new-found-land, and she was another pioneer of
the American tradition.</p>

<p>The only conveyance at the station was a sedan, at least ten
years old. The driver, a young man with a yellow sweater and a
blue denim shirt, thrilled her by clucking (and not laughing at
her, either), 'You one of the actresses, miss? Jump in. You'll
have a good time this summer.'</p>

<p>They drove through marshes, grey-green and still, crossed a
tidal creek, and came to a mile-long bay, with sun-clipped waves.
Twoscore sailboats were at anchor. On one of them, three handsome
burnt youngsters, in white ducks, white jerseys and white boating
hats, were getting up sail, and they waved at her hopefully. Then
the sedan skirted a private estate with bayberry hedges and came
abruptly into the Nutmeg Theatre grounds, which occupied a
quarter of the square-shaped Point Grampion and had Long Island
Sound to south and westward.</p>

<p>Born in the hill-circled city, going to a college on the
Housatonic River, Bethel little knew the sea. She looked across
the Sound some ten or twelve miles to the blurred shore of Long
Island, near Greenport. Fishing schooners were slanting
northward, the lofty sail of a yacht leaned perilously, and
through the middle distance slipped a freighter from foreign
lands. The flickering stretch of the Sound was to her bluer and
more fluid and ever-changing than the blue sky above her own
hills. She felt superstitiously glad. The Sound was a tributary
of open ocean, and she was a tributary of the great theatre.
Actresses, she assured herself, if God is good to them, come down
at last to the sea and to a ship which will bear them to the
lights and cheering in far-off lands.</p>

<p><br>
The grounds had a sand beach on one side, which promised
bathing, and rocks on the other, for loafing in the sun. The flat
top of the low bluff was a whole village in itself: the actual
theatre building, which had been a church; a one-room building as
office; the house of the old-time pastor-farmer, where splendidly
lived the director, Mr. Valentine, and most of the seven
permanent members of the stock company&mdash;all professional
actors&mdash;and such lordly 'guest stars' as might adorn the
casts from week to week; a shop for painting and carpentry; the
School of the Theatre&mdash;the old pastor's barn, with a small
stage and rows of doubtful chairs inserted; and at last, on the
sea edge, with tennis courts beside it, Bethel's new home, the
dormitory and dining quarters for the apprentices. She was too
excited to be critical; otherwise she might have noticed that the
dormitory was shakily knocked together of second-hand boards and
painted with pigment guaranteed to peel immediately. The windows
were narrow and low, their mosquito netting of cotton. But to
Bethel it was the Temple of the Muses, all cool marble and bright
gold.</p>

<p>'Good luck, miss! Hope you drag the crowds in!' said the
driver.</p>

<p>'Oh, thank you. It's wonderful to be here,' she crowed, and
her friend drove off, leaving her alone in the Temple.</p>

<p>Uncomfortably alone.</p>

<p>She ventured into the hallway, which was also the living-room,
of the apprentices' dormitory. With a scratched upright piano, a
long, bare table, a cushionless window seat and a litter of
third-hand chairs, rockers and wicker and canvas deck-chairs, the
room was a charity home. But Bethel was pleased. She was a worker
in the theatre and an insider, not one of the luxurious 'carriage
trade' who came in limousines and demanded upholstered seats but
were never (she innocently believed) welcomed in the holy places
backstage.</p>

<p>The room was still, there was no one on the uncarpeted stairs;
the only stir was from an outboard motor on the Sound.</p>

<p>'Oo-hoo!' she cried, timidly.</p>

<p>Through a door at the back resentfully emerged a lean man, in
overalls, with a stained white moustache.</p>

<p>'What d'you want? You one of the students?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I think so.'</p>

<p>'You <i>think</i> so? Don't y' know? My name is Johnny
Meddock. I run this place.'</p>

<p>'You <i>do!'</i></p>

<p>'Yes, I do! I'm the caretaker. And janitor. I'm responsible
for keeping the floors clean and the windows washed and chasing
the small boys off. Folks also think I'm a Quaint Local
Character. I let 'em think so. It's worth money to me. I even let
'em think I used to be a fisherman here, when this place was a
decent churchyard and a fish wharf and not no theayter, with a
lot of you young women chasing around and flirting and not enough
clothes to dress a pussycat in. I never was. I hate fish. I used
to be a janitor in the State Capitol, in Hartford. Well, what d'
you want?'</p>

<p>'I suppose I ought to see Mr. Roscoe Valentine, first. Do you
know if he's anywheres around?'</p>

<p>'He's in the office&mdash;that one-hen coop by the front of
the theatre. Yes, I guess you might's well see Roscoe, as Andy
Deacon ain't come yet.'</p>

<p>'Andy Deacon?' It was the first time that Bethel had ever
heard the name.</p>

<p>'Yuh, he's the real boss here. Andrew Deacon. He makes out
he's just one of the actors, but it's him puts up most of the
money for Roscoe to blow in. He went to college and everything.
Long about twenty-eight, Andy is. Acts on the stage
regular&mdash;God knows why, rich fellow like him&mdash;his dad
was J. Goddard Deacon; run the big gun factory up in Worcester.
Nice-spoken fellow, Andy is, too&mdash;like a Hartford man. But
you better see Roscoe. So long.'</p>

<p>Johnny Meddock vanished. He who often remarked that he 'hated
theayters and hated their guts' was the most theatrical object in
the place. He was Punch and Judy and Policeman and Devil all in
one.</p>

<p>Bethel, having decided that he was either very hateful or
lovable, went searching for the high priest, Roscoe
Valentine.</p>

<p>Mr. Valentine, in sandals, lilac trousers, a dark blue shirt,
a voluminous white tie and English eyeglasses, was at his desk in
his small cabinlike office, simultaneously writing an
advertisement for <i>The Petrified Forest</i> which, on June
27th, would open the season, dictating a letter to an agent in
New York complaining because he had not received another script,
scratching his left calf with his right foot and planning a
lecture on 'Relaxation, the Secret of Acting'. He looked up at
Bethel blankly.</p>

<p>'Yes? What do you want?'</p>

<p>'I just came to say I'm here, Mr. Valentine.'</p>

<p>'I'm so bright that I might have deduced you were here, but I
still don't know why you are here or who you are.' He looked for
applause from his secretary, a sensible, agreeable-looking young
woman, and didn't get it. He was irritated, and demanded, 'Are
you one of the apprentices?'</p>

<p>'Why yes, don't you remember? I'm Bethel Merriday. Point Royal
College?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes. Nora in <i>Doll's House.</i> You overacted it
atrociously.'</p>

<p>'That's what Mr. O'Toole said.'</p>

<p>'Oh, he did, eh? But even Mr. Jerry O'Toole can sometimes be
right. Well, you go and report to Cynthia Aleshire, my scene
designer. She'll put you to work. And begin to learn right now,
my pigeon, that if you're serious about your stage career, you've
got to do everything you can around here&mdash;learn everything
about the theatre&mdash;everything.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes sir.'</p>

<p>'Very well then. Marian, skip out and show this baby the shop,
and hustle back here.'</p>

<p>The girl secretary, outside, patted the dismayed Bethel
amiably. 'Don't worry about him. His bite is worse than his bark.
But he does know something about acting and producing... I
hope he does!... My name is Marian Croy.'</p>

<p>Miss Croy was twenty-six or -seven, and placid.</p>

<p>'You're his secretary?'</p>

<p>'No, I'm an apprentice, like yourself. I've been teaching
school for six years, out in Nebraska&mdash;I organized a town
dramatic club. I've saved up enough money to take one year off,
for a shot at this place and then Broadway. God knows why I want
to act! I always say it's because I like to read Maeterlinck
aloud (I hope <i>you</i> don't think he's too sentimental, too!),
but maybe it's to try and escape from the prairie winters. If I
don't make a go of it, I'll go back and marry Oscar
Heyden&mdash;he's a nice man, but he looks just the way his name
sounds... Am I babbling, Bethel?'</p>

<p>She loved this kind woman, as Marian went on:</p>

<p>'I am, but you know, I'm just as lonely and scared here as you
are. But busy! Roscoe found out I knew shorthand, so he put me to
work. That's how you learn to act here&mdash;doing everything
that Roscoe would have to pay to have done&mdash;scrubbing floors
or addressing envelopes to theatre subscribers or driving up town
to buy cigarettes. I do hope you don't know pedicuring, or
Roscoe'll probably have you doing his sweet, pink, plump toes.
Good luck, dear. Miss Cynthia Aleshire, scenery boss&mdash;Miss
Bethel Merriday, freshman.'</p>

<p>Cynthia was a trim, tall, Greek-coin lady of thirty-five.
Bethel did not believe that she would ever know Cynthia, but she
instantly felt herself one with the apprentices, sprawled inside
the work shed and in front of it, repainting last year's scenery
a flat grey. They were a joyful crew: two girls in shorts and
jerseys; three young men in overalls, or sweaters and grey
flannels.</p>

<p>There was the plump, jolly, hither-eyed Toni Titmus, who had
just finished freshman year in the University of Wisconsin, but
who at the moment thought that she preferred playing English
duchesses to playing basketball.</p>

<p>An almost anonymous, fresh-faced girl named Anita Hill.</p>

<p>Pete Chew, a round, stupid, wistful rich young man who had
taken to the drama only after having been dropped by Amherst,
Rollins College, and the Schenectady Flying School.</p>

<p>Walter Rolf, slim, competent, decent, twenty-three or -four
and a track runner. It was Walter Rolf's misfortune that, however
much you tried to avoid the word 'clean' in describing him, you
were sure, in the end, to pigeonhole him as a Clean Young
American. He looked like a Princeton Man, and by a coincidence he
was a Princeton Man, with a dash of Oxford.</p>

<p>Last of the crew, incredible as a student actor, was Harry
Mihick.</p>

<p>Like Marian Croy, Harry had come to the theatre late; unlike
her, he was that most portentous of bores, the yearner who knows
that he is much more artistic than he is. Harry was forty; and at
home, in Hannibal, Missouri, he was a bookkeeper. He was also an
actor, in the Y.M.C.A. Drama Guild; a poet, in the
<i>Southwestern Christian Advocate;</i> and a dramatist, in
nothing perceptible. The gang had concluded that Harry had come
to Grampion to find someone who would listen to his play plots.
He would stop swimming to discuss his psyche, and he wrote poetry
to all the girl students. It was pretty good poetry, too&mdash;by
Richard Lovelace.</p>

<p>Of these apprentices, Bethel guessed that only Toni Titmus and
Walter Rolf had talent. But that made two more young actors than
she had ever worked with before, and she was content, though
later she was to calculate that her estimate may have been too
high, by two.</p>

<p><br>
They all knew so very much about the theatre. As they painted
and glued and hammered, and constructed the lunch counter for
<i>The Petrified Forest,</i> they gave final verdicts:</p>

<p>'Claire Luce and Wally Ford were both of 'em too doggone
<i>sophisticated</i> in <i>Mice and Men.</i> I wouldn't of played
Claire's role that way at all. I'd of made her more awkward. You
know. Small-town.'</p>

<p>'I didn't think Cedric Hardwicke was so hot. He made the canon
so darn heartless. I felt he was showing off, all the while. Too
much technique. Now if I'd had that role, I'd of shown how deeply
he felt everything underneath. Of course Sir Cedric is nothing
but an Englishman. How could he play an Irishman? Of course, I'm
not Irish, either, but still...'</p>

<p>'I don't know how the Lunts could waste their time on
foolishness like <i>Amphitryon.</i> I like a play that's got some
social significance. Maybe if I'd been running their schedule,
I'd of stood for <i>The Sea Gull,</i> but these <i>French</i>
plays&mdash;Whatever you may think about the Russians, you
certainly got to admit they got <i>art!'</i></p>

<p><br>
The practically senile Harry Mihick (aged forty) had greeted
her. 'Well, Miss Merriday, I hope you're going to take advantage
of this intimately associating with artists and having a chance
to brush up on ideals this summer.' Nobody laughed much,
either.</p>

<p>Listening to their wisdom, peeping in awe at Toni Titmus as
she perkily revealed that she had once been introduced to Jo
Mielziner, the scene designer, at Sardi's, Bethel felt that she
was again a freshman.</p>

<p>How many more times would she find that she had graduated only
into new freshmanhood? Freshman as a baby, freshman in her first
year in grammar school, freshman in high school, freshman in
college, freshman in a summer theatre, freshman on the
professional stage&mdash;perhaps freshman in marriage and
freshman as a star&mdash;would it end only with death and her
awakening to freshmanhood in heaven?</p>

<p>But she was rescued from humility when she discovered that
these airy habitu&eacute;es of the Nutmeg Playhouse, these
blas&eacute; upper-classmen, had been here only twenty-four hours
longer than herself. By the end of an hour's painting she was
becoming one of them and was saying some pretty profound things
about gag lines. She had discovered that if she endured their
idiocies without laughing, they would stand for hers.</p>

<p>The sea wind ran across the rough wild grass, touching her
hair; and she was really painting a stencil on real scenery; and
she was in a world where she could talk about the theatre from
eight a.m. to two a.m.</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I&mdash;I think I'm going to like it!' she burst out
to the beautiful Walter Rolf.</p>

<p>'Sure,' he said convincingly.</p>

<p>It was more than good enough.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<p class="first">BETHEL'S dormitory room, a double room which she
was to share with Iris Pentire of the stock company, was as
utilitarian as a boxcar. It had two cots, two straight chairs,
two tilted bureaus, with blisters in the paint, and a row of
hooks. But to Bethel, washing up for dinner on her first evening
in Grampion, it was enchantment, for on the wall was a last
season's poster:</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">THE NUTMEG PLAYERS<br>

<i>Present</i><br>

MISS ETHEL BARRYMORE<br>

<i>in</i><br>

<big>THE CONSTANT WIFE</big></p>

<p><br>
This was no bedroom, but the anteroom to glory! Here her
friend Iris Pentire and she would be queens of the stage, along
with Ethel Barrymore.</p>

<p>Cynthia Aleshire, the scene designer, said that Iris, who
would arrive to-morrow, was a phenomenon: slim, lovely, only
twenty, but already a professional actress and one of the seven
Equity-member professionals of the Nutmeg permanent stock company
at Grampion. Iris had, reported Cynthia, been a chorus girl, a
photographer's model, played stock in Baltimore, and toured in a
minor part in <i>Teacher Mustn't Slap.</i> In fact, at only
twenty, Iris had as much grilling stage experience as, a
generation before, she would have had at the age of six. But as
the youngest of the professional stock company, at minimum
salary, Iris was to live not in the Bostonian luxury of The House
but with the submarginal citizens of the dormitory.</p>

<p>Bethel was going to love Iris even if she hated her.</p>

<p>She stripped off her sweater and slacks, sang in the shower,
and in the pride of blue skirt and clean white sweater she ran
down to dinner.</p>

<p>There were sixteen student-apprentices at Grampion. They were
unpaid, and classed as amateurs, but each of them was permitted
by Equity to appear in three plays during the summer. Higher in
the hierarchy were the permanent stock company, with Mr. Andrew
Deacon and Miss Mahala Vale as leads, and other visiting
professional actors and 'guest stars' who appeared in one or two
out of the schedule of ten plays presented during the summer of
1938.</p>

<p>To-night eleven out of the sixteen apprentices had come, and
were being dramatic over veal loaf, cottage-fried potatoes,
coleslaw, stuffed peppers, and huckleberry pie about a table
which was made of two retired barn doors resting on saw
horses.</p>

<p>Pete Chew, the rich and roundly young, of whom it was already
obvious that his best role in the theatre world would be donating
scholarships to the hat-check girls in night clubs, had
wondrously changed from overalls (by Abercrombie, Fitch) to
chequed grey trousers, black and white shoes, and a sweater from
the Isle of Uist. (But why Uist?) He had been buzzing about Toni
Titmus at the workshop; now, as Bethel ventured into the
dining-room, Pete looked brightly at her, approached her with a
festive waddle, seized her arm and cheered, 'Uncle Pete'll sit
beside you, pretty-pretty, and save you from the sharks.'</p>

<p>'So the poor little rich boy is going to tell another prospect
how unappreciated he is,' said Marian Croy, the
teacher-secretary-apprentice.</p>

<p>'Let him alone. Maybe he'll put money into a show for us
someday!' screamed Toni.</p>

<p>'I don't think it's nice of you to mock a fellow-traveller on
the gipsy trail of the arts,' said Harry Mihick.</p>

<p>Bethel listened doubtfully. But Cynthia Aleshire was talking
about things called 'functionalism' and 'formalism' in stage
settings, and how you can play <i>Macbeth</i> all up and down and
under a staircase.</p>

<p>The sea, filling the windows, was softening into apricot over
toward the horizon; and now Bethel met Fletcher Hewitt...
quite the nicest man, she decided, whom she had ever seen.</p>

<p>Fletcher Hewitt, though he could not have been over thirty,
was the traditional Yankee; Uncle Sam without his whiskers; tall,
thin, rusty-haired, speaking with calc'lation. His father had
been a Rhode Island carpenter, his mother an ambitious New Jersey
school teacher, caught in matrimony on an innocent summer
vacation. At eighteen, with his widowed mother, Fletcher had gone
direct to Broadway. He was a good stage manager. He had nursed
twoscore plays in New York and on the road. In the Nutmeg Players
it was his job not only to watch entrances and off-stage noises
and curtains and all the other housekeeping and kitchenwork of
the arts, but to carry on direction when Mr. Valentine was sick
after one of his nauseas of temperament, and to keep Cynthia from
making the scenery so functional that it wouldn't function.</p>

<p>Fletcher's pale blue eyes were serene as summer.</p>

<p>Looking at the Higher Thinkers&mdash;Marian Croy, Cynthia
Aleshire, Fletcher Hewitt, Walter Rolf&mdash;Bethel was certain
that she was going to have four solid friends. But still to
arrive were the real divinities: Andrew Deacon, Mahala Vale, the
young leading woman, and Iris Pentire, who would be Bethel's own
true twin.</p>

<p>The rocks looking on the Sound were their drawing-room after
dinner, and the twilit moment was complete as they lounged
there&mdash;Bethel, Fletcher, Walter, Toni Titmus; tired actors
(tired from scraping scenery), carelessly disposed in rest (but
pretty careful about their attitudes of carelessness; the
indolence of a knee, the angle of a face resting on a hand).</p>

<p>Toni screamed, 'I've got to go up and write the loving
parents. I wonder do we get any dancing lessons this summer? Oh,
to be a Bernhardt, now that my stage career is here, and me not
in the doghouse&mdash;not yet. See you soon.' Walter Rolf sighed,
'I've got to try and finish Stanislavski's <i>An Actor
Prepares,</i> before we get down to real work and I learn that
Stanislavski is all exhibitionistic nonsense. Good night.'</p>

<p>Fletcher Hewitt stretched and demanded, 'Your name's
Bethel?'</p>

<p>'Uh-huh.'</p>

<p>'Going to take acting seriously?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I am.'</p>

<p>'I guess most of the apprentices are. For instance, a nice
chap like Rolf&mdash;I'll bet anything he's got an uncle who's
head of some factory and would give him a job, but Walter will
gamble on earning fifty dollars a week twenty weeks a year, as an
actor. Or an old bird like me&mdash;I'm thirty and I didn't have
a job all last winter and I have to support my mother and prob'ly
I could make two hundred a week in Hollywood, but I'd rather get
sixty as assistant stage manager of a road show. Thousands of
youngsters ready to starve if they can just have a chance on the
stage, and no more permanent winter stock companies to train
them, and so few touring companies&mdash;and that's the fault of
the provincial audiences; they'd get the shows if they wanted 'em
enough, if they knew their business as audiences as well as we
know our jobs on the stage. So we flock to these theatrical Boy
Scout camps&mdash;and we're making 'em into good theatres, too!
Probably eighty-five summer theatres in the country solid enough
to last through the season&mdash;probably two thousand kids,
mostly from comfortable homes, that are willing to scrub floors
and usher and shift scenery, with the thermometer a hundred
backstage, to get a chance to act. If the theatre's dead, we're
going to revive it&mdash;we're reviving it right now! So! Well,
I've got to go and have a fight with our electrician.'</p>

<p>She was alone on the rocks when the oversize faun, Pete Chew,
found her and crouched by her and automatically seized her
hand.</p>

<p>'You like it here?' he said.</p>

<p>'Oh yes.'</p>

<p>'And we'll have a good time, too. You stick by Uncle Pete,
pretty-pretty. There's a lot of places where you can go dancing,
and take a drink, but I'm liberal; I never insist on a girl
taking a drink, unless she wants to. If we can maybe get hold of
another fellow when the rest get here&mdash;I thought Walter Rolf
would be a good sport, but he's a stuffed shirt&mdash;but if we
can round up some live wire, him and Toni and you and I can have
one swell summer. And swimming.'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I'm going to work most of the time.'</p>

<p>'Oh, don't be that way. That kind of junk is all right in
college, but we're artists&mdash;we can do anything we like and
get away with it. Don't you know that?'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I hadn't thought about it.'</p>

<p>'Well, I see where old Uncle Pete has got to start your brain
whirling. You come from a woman's college, don't you? And the
backwoods?'</p>

<p>'Just a small manufacturing city.'</p>

<p>'You see? How do you expect to be a high-class actress and act
in plays about Long Island society if you don't hustle up and see
the world? Why, I'll take you down to New Haven sometime, and
we'll do Savin Rock. I got my own car. A Lincoln!'</p>

<p>Bethel tried to be tactful and retreat. 'Do you want to act in
society plays?'</p>

<p>'Well, I'll tell you, Bethel. I'm not so much on the charm and
social stuff, though my family is one of the best in Bronxville.
I'm more you might say a comedian. I did Falstaff in prep
school&mdash;the Ypsilanti Military Academy. I had a row with a
crank in the dramatic club at Amherst, so I never got into
that&mdash;oh yes, I'm an Amherst man, I went there till I got
sick of the place, so darn <i>provincial&mdash;</i>but I'm a good
comedian. And I'm thinking about doing a lot with the financial
backing of plays. I can be the biggest influence on Broadway!
That's why I want all this training this summer. You'll see me
one of the hottest producers in town some day. What I could do
for a girl! I'd plan for her and make her the biggest actress in
America!'</p>

<p>'I see. Maybe you can do that for Toni Titmus.'</p>

<p>'Her? That little tramp? She thinks she knows everything. I
told her I was just interested in her artistically, and she
laughed at me. She claims she was a walk-on in <i>Our Town,</i>
and so she's a professional, is she! And when I asked her if she
liked presents, she says she only likes jewellery! Nothing doing!
No, no&mdash;but you and me would get along wonderfully. I had a
voice teacher in New York for a month, Miss Lazla
Lastigora&mdash;you know, the famous one that taught Mrs. Pat
Campbell and Clark Gable and everybody&mdash;and she said I was
very sensitive. Come on!'</p>

<p>He patted her shoulder enthusiastically.</p>

<p>She achieved in answer nothing more than,
'I&mdash;uh&mdash;'</p>

<p>'If you been stuck away in a girls' college, you probably
don't know anything about having a good time. And I certainly
hate to see as lovely a kid as you wasted on a lot of amateur
hams here. Maybe you think it's kind of sudden, but I swear, I'm
falling in love with you. Do you like me?'</p>

<p>She spoke feelingly:</p>

<p>'I hope it won't happen to you, what happened to the last boy
that fell in love with me.'</p>

<p>'What's that?'</p>

<p>'Yes. In Sladesbury. Oh, the handsomest, wildest, gayest
boy&mdash;Charlemagne Hatch. I <i>told</i> him I wouldn't be good
for him. I <i>warned</i> him. But oh, why, why, why did
he&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Did he <i>what?'</i></p>

<p>'Just when I'd got so I couldn't live without him. I was
always telephoning him when he wasn't there! Why did he do
it?'</p>

<p>'W-what did he do?'</p>

<p>'Leaped right off the top of the City Hall.'</p>

<p>'Gee!'</p>

<p>'Oh, ever so much worse than that old professor... Doctor
Bickling.'</p>

<p>'W-what happened to <i>him?'</i></p>

<p>'Oh, not so bad, but I remember he talked so much like you. He
was sensitive, too, the way you are. And just when I thought he
and I were going to be so happy he&mdash;I can't stand it!'</p>

<p>'What <i>did</i> he do?'</p>

<p>'He ran away.'</p>

<p>'Golly!'</p>

<p>'They say somebody saw him afterwards in a low grogshop in,
uh, Mexico!'</p>

<p>'No!'</p>

<p>'Why is it, Pete? You don't think I'm insane, do you&mdash;am
I a <i>femme fatale?'</i></p>

<p>'A <i>what?</i> No, no, I don't believe you are. Well,
I&mdash;gotta be getting along. I'll be seein' you!'</p>

<p>Bethel heard him shouting under Toni's window. 'Hey, come on
down and let's go summers and get a drink. I need one!'</p>

<p>She smiled, even as she sat among the ruins hearing her mother
say, 'Bethel Merriday, I'm sur<i>-prised!'</i></p>

<p>But in the darkness she remembered Fletcher Hewitt's sermon
about the children's crusade of the summer theatre. She thought
of the hundreds of other young people who were this moment
dreaming of the theatre, by the sea, in the cool hills, in the
rustling woods, under the stars&mdash;boys and girls from
factories and colleges and farms, from disapproving New England
mansions and flats in the East Side ghetto, exhibitionists and
sound workers, Communists and Tories and plain bored at
home&mdash;an army of Gay Contemptibles.</p>

<p>How absurd must once have seemed the butcher's son from
Stratford, piping on his penny whistle as he trudged to London,
under the stars.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<p class="first">ON Saturday, her second day at Grampion, Bethel
could not see what the tasks which Roscoe Valentine and Fletcher
Hewitt and Cynthia Aleshire gave her had to do with acting. She
helped the coloured maid set the table in the dormitory. She
answered the telephone in the box office for an hour. She sewed
at heavy red curtains for the courtroom scene in <i>Night of
January 16th</i> till her fingers trembled. She stitched and hung
a new chintz curtain in the star's dressing-room, to honour their
greatest guest star, the famous Nile Sanderac (she ranked almost
with Ina Claire in playing elegant young married women), who
would be coming in a week now, to enact <i>Candida.</i></p>

<p>Bethel's most theatrical duty was to drive the old Ford
station wagon into Grampion Centre and borrow, for the
<i>Petrified Forest</i> set, a cash register and a couple of
round tables from Mr. Butch Stevens, proprietor and
<i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> of the Lobster Pot Dance Hall
and Dinery. Mr. Valentine did not 'believe' in buying such
accessories or in renting them. It was a serious matter of
principle. He loved a nickel with the same spirited and devoted
passion that he devoted to God and Bernard Shaw.</p>

<p>'B-but suppose Mr. Butch doesn't want to lend them?' protested
Bethel.</p>

<p>Roscoe almost screamed: 'Don't take any nonsense from him! You
tell him I say he gets half his customers from my theatre, and he
won't need this stuff&mdash;second-hand junk; I know; I've used
'em before!&mdash;till mid-July, when the summer season's in full
swing. Don't let him bluff you!'</p>

<p>Across the lunch counter of the Lobster Pot, Bethel smiled on
the lumpish Butch Stevens and said briskly, 'Hello!'</p>

<p>'Hya.'</p>

<p>'I'm glad there's such a nice place to eat at in Grampion. I
suspect I'll be coming here a lot this summer, with my
bunch.'</p>

<p>'You one of the theatre girls?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Huh! None of you kids ever buy anything more than a malted
milk.'</p>

<p>'Oh, my bunch will. I'll see to it they do. Now Mr. Stevens, I
can see&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You can call me Butch.'</p>

<p>'&mdash;I can tell from the way you look at me that you know I
want to ask you a favour. You're the kind that can't be
fooled.'</p>

<p>'So what do you want to borrow for the theatre this time?
Summer 'fore last, they took all my Coca-Cola posters and brought
'em back torn. But last summer, one time I was away, damn' if
Valentine didn't send some of the kids in here to "borrow" four
ham sandwiches!&mdash;and the girl let 'em have 'em, and that's
the last time I ever see any of them sandwiches, and when I
tackled Valentine about paying for 'em, he said he didn't know
anything about it, and asked me which girls it was borrowed 'em,
and Lord, I can't tell none of you actresses apart&mdash;you all
look alike to me&mdash;all bare-nekkid legs and sweaters and a
lay-off-roe look. So what do I get stung for this time?...
Just some tables and a cash register? Does there have to be money
in the cash register? Because I suppose if Valentine wanted it,
I'd have to give it to him, or else these codfish-eating Yankees
here would say I didn't have any public spirit.'</p>

<p>'Aren't you a Yankee?'</p>

<p>'Me? No, thank God! I'm a foreigner... from New
Jersey.'</p>

<p><br>
She returned to the theatre, at noon, to find newly arrived
four members of the permanent stock company: Tudor Blackwall, the
second juvenile, sleek and doe-eyed and just faintly effeminate;
Clara Ribbons and George Keezer (incomprehensibly but always
known as Doc Keezer), who were both middle-aged veterans
technically classed as 'wise old troupers'; and, at last, the
baby of the stock company, Iris Pentire, who was to be Bethel's
own twin.</p>

<p>And she knew instantly that she would never know Iris.</p>

<p>That other twenty-year-old, Toni, the plump and pretty, had
been unhesitatingly friendly, but Iris, moving silkily about the
room she was to share with Bethel, putting away salmon-coloured
silk pyjamas and maribou-edged silver bed jacket and scarlet
pumps with gold heels high as obelisks, cautiously smiling and
musically murmuring, 'Thank you for letting me come in with you',
was hidden with cloudy veils. She was a Mystery.</p>

<p>And Miss Iris Pentire saw to it that she should continue to be
a Mystery.</p>

<p>The most nearly convincing stories about Iris that Bethel was
ever to hear were that she was the daughter of an Irish nobleman,
reared in a nunnery, still piously virginal and viewing her stage
career as a means of portraying the austere beauties of virtue;
and that she was shanty Irish, from Wheeling, West Virginia, and
had had only twelve words, headed by 'Okay', in her vocabulary
until, at the age of sixteen, she had become the sweetheart of
Clum Weslick, the distinguished director, who had provided her
with tutors and chiropodists.</p>

<p>Slender, fragile, with hair not golden but colour of sunset
gold reflected on a silver box, sweet eyes, and mouth that
appeared sweet unless you saw it twisted in anger; silent,
defenceless and slim as the child Elsie Krall; silent and sweet
and never quite saying what she meant; silent and soft-moving;
that was Iris Pentire; and one moment Bethel thought she was a
statuette of gold and ivory, a charm to wonder at; and the next,
a voodoo priestess.</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I don't suppose you care much for swimming?' said
Bethel.</p>

<p>'No, I'm afraid I don't care much for swimming,' smiled
Iris.</p>

<p>'I hope you'll like it here,' said Bethel&mdash;the Old
Resident at Grampion.</p>

<p><br>
Saturday noon, a young man who looked like a research
scientist, and who may actually have been so but was now employed
as one of the Deacon chauffeurs, flashed into the theatre grounds
and left Mr. Andrew Deacon's favourite car, an English
Rolls-Royce with a convertible coup&eacute; body, to await Mr.
Deacon's arrival as male lead in the Nutmeg company. It seemed
that Mr. Deacon's mother would be driving him down from Newport
in a day or two.</p>

<p>All the apprentices, whether they came from Fond du Lac or New
York's East Side, were expert and blas&eacute; about automobiles.
But even their youthful American cocksureness was shaken now.</p>

<p>'Gosh, this Andy Deacon must be some actor. I bet if he chased
Juliet in that buggy, he'd get her,' said Toni Titmus, in a tone
of vesper prayer.</p>

<p>Bethel wondered if Roscoe Valentine overmuch loved his
partner, for, looking at the car, Roscoe muttered&mdash;even to
her, the outsider, the raw recruit, 'Huh! Andy doesn't hide his
wealth much, does he&mdash;our theatrical playboy! But the fact
is, all the money is his mother's, not his at all&mdash;and does
the dear old dowager let him know it!'</p>

<p><br>
Roscoe interrupted her stippling of canvas flats, for the
adobe walls of the Black Mesa Bar-B-Q in <i>The Petrified
Forest,</i> Saturday afternoon, and sent her on the illustrious
mission of meeting Mahala Vale, the leading lady&mdash;she who
had done so well, the past two seasons on Broadway, as a featured
player in <i>Betty, Be Quick,</i> which lasted four months, and
the sensational share-cropper play <i>You Cannot Dispossess Our
Souls,</i> which had lasted four nights and one
matin&eacute;e&mdash;the second play having been a favourite of
labour-union publications and the first play of labour-union
members.</p>

<p>Mahala Vale descended from the dusty local train like a
leading woman determined to be pleasant, and with a high
handshake she caroled, 'It was so sweet of you to meet me, Miss
Merriday'.</p>

<p>Mahala could not have been over twenty-five or -six, but she
looked like a young woman who knew her job; carrying herself with
authority, on the tall side, wide-browed, chestnut-haired, the
true goddess; beautiful in a standard way where Iris was pretty
in an exciting, perplexing way, and Bethel was either
insignificant, or as tantalizing as music.</p>

<p>'A station wagon? How very exciting! Shall I sit up beside
you? It smells of fish, doesn't it!' said Mahala.</p>

<p>Bethel was hereafter to hear her say a great many things in
her 'cello voice, and never to know whether Mahala meant any of
them, or what she was thinking, or whether she was thinking at
all. If Iris Pentire was openly mysterious, Mahala Vale was
mysteriously open; if Iris bewildered the frank heart of Bethel
by her silence, Mahala baffled her by easy and indecipherable
chatter.</p>

<p><br>
All sixteen of the apprentices and most of the stock company
had arrived by Saturday evening, and they sat all over the rocks
by the shore, as vocal as a flock of blackbirds. Bethel again
felt like a freshman&mdash;like a freshbird. She was an
approachable fledgeling, but a lone one, never quite willing to
belong completely to the rule of any bevy.</p>

<p>She looked at the bumptious Pete Chew and the enterprising
Toni Titmus snickering together&mdash;and sometimes, she felt
uncomfortably, glancing over at her. She looked at Iris Pentire,
alone, posed as a lone sweet goddess (small-sized) awaiting the
mystery of the moon. She looked at Mahala Vale, being gracious
and countess-like on behalf of a circle composed of the handsome
Tudor Blackwall, Doc Keezer, the trouper, Walter Rolf, and the
rustic Harry Mihick; telling them what she had said to George
Jean Nathan&mdash;though with a considerable avoidance of what
George Jean Nathan had said to her. She looked at the honest
Fletcher Hewitt being respectful&mdash;God knows why!&mdash;to
Roscoe Valentine and to Cynthia Aleshire, the scene designer.
Suddenly she preferred the honest guttersnipes, Pete and Toni, to
all of them, and felt elated when she saw Pete (to-night
incomparable in a cream Palm Beach suit with a white silk shirt
and a crocus-yellow sash about his globular middle) rolling
toward her.</p>

<p>'Look, Beth,' Pete whispered hoarsely, 'don't worry about you
telling me about your Past.'</p>

<p>'What are you talking about? I haven't <i>got</i> a Past!'</p>

<p>'You can trust me, Beth. I'm like the grave. I haven't told a
soul.'</p>

<p>'Except Toni!'</p>

<p>'Huh? Oh. Her. Well. Yes. Maybe. She don't count. How about
you and me going to Clinton to the dance tonight?'</p>

<p>'Aren't you afraid to go with me?'</p>

<p>'Well, I think a fellow ought to have experience, if he's
going to be a star. In school I didn't hardly have a chance to
see any life.'</p>

<p>'How about that little waitress?'</p>

<p>Now Bethel knew nothing whatever regarding the relationship of
Pete Chew to any waitress. Something inside her had told her to
say that; and she was as astonished as Pete, who gasped like a
carp, and begged:</p>

<p>'How the dickens did you ever&mdash;Honestly, that didn't mean
anything at all. I fixed it all up. Oh, sure! I learned about
women from her. But Beth, you got to remember, you <i>got</i> to
remember that I've always been kept down by a whole slew of rich
relatives and profs. You got to teach me. Golly, you and me could
be such friends. Would you like a snake-skin belt?'</p>

<p>'I would not!'</p>

<p>'I know where I can get an elegant one for you, cheap. I mean
I want to give it to you. I mean a present. You know. I mean just
as a present.'</p>

<p>'No, thank you, Pete.'</p>

<p>'And you won't go to the dance with me?'</p>

<p>That intrusive inner voice was again speaking: 'Don't be such
a blasted prig to this poor Bronxville Casanova. He's an amateur
even at that. Even with the best tutors and the best champagne,
he'll never be a good flirt&mdash;not a real specialist.' Thus
warned, she said almost tenderly:</p>

<p>'Not now, Pete. Maybe some time.'</p>

<p>'And could I give you a box of candy? Two pounds!'</p>

<p>'If you'd like.'</p>

<p>'I'll drive right into the Centre and buy it.'</p>

<p>It was the first of the assaults on her virtue which, as an
actress, she had the right to expect, in tribute to her charm and
beauty, and she was alarmed to find that she felt rather proud of
it.</p>

<p>Pete gone, Bethel saw Toni Titmus scampering toward her. If
Toni was not as fat as Pete Chew, there was no reason why she
mightn't become so. Bethel could see them, forty years from now,
as an admirable old married couple, devoted to food, the theatre,
and the rights of immorality.</p>

<p>Toni said cautiously, 'Well, how do you like it here,
Beth?'</p>

<p>'Oh, fine.'</p>

<p>'Well... I guess you find it pretty tame, though.'</p>

<p>With huge gratification, Bethel saw that someone was in awe of
her. She felt beautiful, languorous, and a little weary of
strange sins. All of that she put into her line: 'Oh, it's good
to get away to the quiet country for a change.'</p>

<p>'Tell me, Beth&mdash;honestly, I've never had a chance to ask
any girl that knew: Do you think it's better, when you've had a
row with the boy friend and you're in wrong but of course you
don't want to admit it&mdash;should you call him up or wait for
him to phone?'</p>

<p>This fundamental social problem&mdash;one that Bethel had,
actually, never encountered&mdash;she solved airily: 'My
experience is, you better wait and keep him guessing. If he
doesn't phone, then you haven't really got him captured anyway,
and so you're safely out of it. These men! You have to be brutal
with 'em.'</p>

<p>'Are you brutal with 'em, Beth?'</p>

<p>'Oh, always!'</p>

<p>'Are you really, sure enough?'</p>

<p>'Certainly. Anyone with experience is.'</p>

<p>'How do you handle 'em if a boy comes home with you and makes
a pass at you&mdash;one that you don't <i>want</i> to have make a
pass at you, I mean.'</p>

<p>'Just look at 'em and smile sort of cynically.'</p>

<p>'Cynically?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sure&mdash;cynically.'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know. Of course I haven't been much persecuted
by really dangerous men yet.' She sighed. 'Oh, there's plenty of
boys that chase you in the university, and back home in Fond du
Lac, but that don't get far if you're living home or with a lot
of girls. Of course when I get to New York and take a job on the
stage, I guess I'll have a little apartment to myself&mdash;of
course just a little one, not very big&mdash;and then I guess
I'll have to cope with some pretty unscrupulous fellows,
producers and playwrights and like that, old unscrupulous ones,
forty or so, and I'll just have to cope with 'em!' She looked
much brighter.</p>

<p>Swept by Toni's narrative powers, seeing her own self facing a
vicious old seducer of forty or so in the stilly perils of a
one-room apartment, Bethel panted, forgot the theme of her own
role, and stated with indignant virtue, 'A man like that, you
just look him square in the eye and say, "Now don't be silly! I'm
not your sort and you better know it right now. Don't you
try&mdash;"'</p>

<p>She stopped, realizing that Toni was staring at her,
meditative, then derisive; and after a pause was jeering, 'Look
here now, Bethel Merriday! My Lord, and you fooled wise old
rounders like Pete and me! But I'll bet you're nothing at all but
a Good Girl!'</p>

<p>Bethel looked stricken.</p>

<p>'Isn't that true? Huh? Huh? Isn't it?'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid it is&mdash;more or less,' whimpered Bethel.</p>

<p>Toni was triumphant, then forgiving: 'Gee, I don't blame you
for fooling a dumbbell like Pete. He's asking for it. Oh, he's
had experience, all right, but just with waitresses and heiresses
and screwballs like that. He don't understand educated artists,
like you and I! And&mdash;God knows if this got known around it
would ruin me&mdash;but the truth is I'm still a Good Girl
myself! Ain't that the limit!'</p>

<p>But they agreed that Iris Pentire, still sitting by herself
and smiling mysteriously, couldn't be anything so commonplace as
a Good Girl.</p>

<p>They were the more certain of it as slowly Iris attracted Pete
Chew, Fletcher Hewitt, the blundering Harry Mihick, and two newly
come apprentices: Cy Fickerty, a curly-headed, screaming, village
clown, and Bruce Pasture, a too-sensitive-looking boy from St.
Stephen's College.</p>

<p>The elegant Iris (who was Toni's own age and two years younger
than Bethel), was quavering to her pages with faint, fragile
dignity, 'I said to him, "It's vulgar of you to remind me that I
was once a chorus girl. I would stoop to even that kind of work
to get the training necessary for my career, but now," I said, "I
won't consider anything but the poetic drama or a good part in a
George Abbott play," I said, "and it's about time that you agents
learned to appreciate sensitiveness," I told him.'</p>

<p>Toni whispered to Bethel, 'Oh, nuts!'</p>

<p>'You said it,' remarked an entirely new version of Bethel.</p>

<p>'Let's grab off Pete and Cy Fickerty and go to that dance.
That okay by you?'</p>

<p>'Okay,' said Bethel.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN Grampion Centre, Sabbath breakers had once
been exposed in the stocks, and householders had warmed their
cakes on Sunday only by their pastors' eloquence about hell-fire.
But the Nutmeg Players, once their season had started, recognized
Sunday only by the dress rehearsal of the coming week's play and
by permitting all the apprentices to sleep till noon... after
having spent all of Saturday night removing the scenery of last
week's bill and setting up the new.</p>

<p>But with the first play not yet on, Bethel and her
fellow-wights had on Sunday the one only day of leisure they were
ever to know at Grampion. She slept till after lunch, following
the rather aimless dance at Clinton, so unenterprising an event
that Pete Chew had tried to kiss her only twice. She was too late
to join the various motor expeditions and, after a sandwich and
coffee which the grumbling Johnny Meddock dug up for her, sat on
the sea-washed rocks, facing the sun.</p>

<p>She did not greatly mind being alone. She liked people, but
people noisy in a mass embarrassed her. No matter, she told
herself; no actress was ever called upon to play an entire
mob!</p>

<p>Here, in the Y.M.C.A. of the arts, she had hoped to find a
friend, a love, an idol to adore. But she regarded the youngsters
like Toni Titmus as babies&mdash;and the seniors like Fletcher
Hewitt considered <i>her</i> a baby. Well, she would just have to
be alone again and like it.</p>

<p>The theatre grounds, so like the campus of a rustic college,
were blankly peaceful; the water high coloured and the sails
flying. She was content, she was a grown-up and busy
actress&mdash;and suddenly she was an excited small girl again,
as the great car, a limousine with chauffeur, rolled up in front
of her, and a young god, sunburned and smiling, with cropped
brazen hair and strong bronze neck, a tweed-bearing god of
twenty-eight or -nine, slipped out of the car and addressed
her.</p>

<p>'Hello, hello! Anybody around? Roscoe been transported to
heaven yet?'</p>

<p>'I think he's only gone to New Haven.'</p>

<p>'Then God help Yale! And it was such a nice boys' school when
I used to attend it!'</p>

<p><br>
Andrew Deacon, the leading man and co-director and angel of
the Nutmeg Players, may have depended on his decorativeness as a
rather rich, rather handsome, very athletic young man, instead of
on flexible skill as an actor. Perhaps he was too aggressively
youthful and humorous, too relentlessly charming. He shouted his
adoration of the theatre and his determination to revive it in
every town in the land&mdash;shouted and chanted and smiled it,
at rehearsals and late suppers, so constantly as to cause older
workers in the vineyard to growl, 'Oh, curse the theatre! I'm
going to save my salary and buy a chicken farm'.</p>

<p>But Bethel thought him the most magic person she had ever
seen. She had found a diamond on the pavement. And
unquestionably, the moment Andy Deacon arrived, the Nutmeg
Players came alive and turned from a mob into a spirited
army.</p>

<p>Things began to happen. Things&mdash;not necessarily sensible
or commendable&mdash;would bountifully and rapidly happen
whenever Andy was around. Everybody miraculously appeared from
nowhere, greeting Andy the Sun God, the moment he stepped out of
his Olympian mother's sixteen-cylinder Cadillac chariot. The old
troupers, Doc Keezer and Clara Ribbons, arm in arm, rolled across
the horizon, murmuring, 'Glad you're with us, Mr. Deacon'.
Cynthia Aleshire popped out of a dormitory living-room that had
certainly been empty three minutes before, crying, 'Oh, Andy,
Roscoe won't let me try an expressionistic set for
<i>Candida,</i> and I know I can just get the quality of that
stuffy liberalism'. Tudor Blackwall and Bruce Pasture, the
violin-playing apprentice, came caroling, 'Welcome, boss'. Pete
Chew and Toni drove up with Pete's Lincoln practically rearing
and neighing, and looked approvingly at Andy's dark blue flannel
shirt with white tie.</p>

<p>In fact, the peasant chorus was entering, inaudibly
chanting:</p>

<br>


<p class="verse">

'Hurray, hurray, it's festival to-day,<br>

Our young prince is arriving, from his court so far away.'</p>

<br>

<p>Then out of the limousine stepped the heavies&mdash;but they
were too serious for so bright an operetta: Andy's mother, Mrs.
J. Goddard Deacon of Worcester and Newport, that white-haired
serenity who had done so well in keeping the late Mr. J. Goddard
Deacon's munition millions (and she was in her own right a
Pilchard of Plymouth, and as such entitled to sit on Plymouth
Rock), and Andy's fianc&eacute;e, the lovely Miss Joan
Hinterwald, of the Fall River and Gastonia woollen millions. And
suddenly appearing, facing these two women and not liking them in
the least, was Miss Mahala Vale.</p>

<p>Andy kissed Mahala, crying, 'Hello, darling, so glad we're
going to play together this summer. We'll show 'em love's young
dream!'</p>

<p>'You must have acted with Mr. Deacon,' said Miss Hinterwald to
Miss Vale, with a short sniff.</p>

<p>'Andy and I played opposite each other for four months in
<i>Grey Tide,'</i> said Miss Vale, with a fairly good imitation
of a sniff.</p>

<p>'I see,' said Miss Hinterwald.</p>

<p>Bethel perceived that the two young ladies, Joan and Mahala,
were enough alike to indicate that this was Andy's fated pattern
in the way of loves. Both were tall, broad-shouldered,
light-footed, chestnut-haired, wide between the eyes and politely
contemptuous. But while Miss Hinterwald was the real thing in the
way of Long Island and Newport plutocracy, pleasantly snobbish to
the entire world, including Andy, Miss Mahala Vale wasn't quite
certain whether there weren't a few people, including Andy and
Roscoe, to whom she'd better not be snobbish. Bethel had been
developing a quite healthy small hatred for Mahala, but now she
enlisted under her, hoped that she would take Andy away from the
Hinterwald girl and marry him immediately&mdash;though she saw
that this would mean that she herself would never have a chance
at the young Sun God.</p>

<p>She was startled. For the first time Bethel knew that she was
lorn and lost in love.</p>

<p><br>
When Andy's mother had said, 'Don't be an idiot and work too
hard at your playing, this summer' and had retired into the
silken wolf cave of her limousine; when Joan had kissed him as
though it were a habit and not a very good habit; when the
chauffeur had turned the great car, looking scornfully at the
grassy ruts, and it had slid away, in silence and disdain, then
Andy woke up, and the Nutmeg Players woke.</p>

<p>He put his arm about Toni and Clara Ribbons, he patted
Roscoe's back&mdash;Roscoe winced; he shook hands with Harry
Mihick and Pete Chew and remembered their names for almost two
minutes, and he shouted, 'To-morrow we go to work on <i>Petrified
Forest.</i> Roscoe and God being willing, we shall rehearse
twelve hours a day, and I expect to be a better Alan than Leslie
Howard, and I know Mahala will beat Peggy Conklin all hollow as
Gabby'.</p>

<p>'I don't suppose your Miss Hinterwald will be coming down from
Newport to see us, though,' sniffed Mahala.</p>

<p>'Her? She will not! What's Newport? Ha' done with the tents of
Shem, dear lass, we've seen the Newport seasons through, and it's
time to turn on the old trail, the repertory trail, the strictly
one-sixty-five-top trail, that is always new. Let's go!' And he
kissed Mahala again&mdash;but this time as though he took a
personal interest in it&mdash;and picked up his bags to carry
them to the House.</p>

<p>'He's kind of coy, don't you think?' said Marian Croy.</p>

<p>'Oh no, just young,' said old Bethel.</p>

<p>And later, passing the open windows of the House living-room,
Bethel heard Andy and Roscoe discussing the season's casting.
Andy was talking now without whimsy, quickly, firmly, cajoling
the querulous Roscoe but not bullying him&mdash;not quite
bullying him.</p>

<p>She was convinced that of all the people she had known, this
Andrew Deacon was the only one who was radiantly, unquestionably,
good enough for earth and heaven.</p>

<p><br>
Sitting alone on the rocks, brooding, that evening, and
telling herself that she mustn't sit alone brooding&mdash;it was
antisocial or something like that&mdash;she felt herself a small
child, and rather silly in wishing that some day Andy Deacon
would be interested in her, be able to identify her in the whole
mess of apprentices. She would never have a chance against the
luminous Mahala.</p>

<p>Oh, they were all pigs, these tall, demanding women like Joan
and Mahala!</p>

<p>She was relieved when Pete Chew came bumbling up and told her
that she was a remarkably intelligent woman, ever so much more
Intellectual and Sympathetic than Toni Titmus. When Pete tried to
kiss her good night at the dormitory door, she had no sensation
about it whatever, not even anger.</p>

<p>She was excited to find that someone, if only a Pete Chew,
considered her a woman. But was anyone ever going to consider her
an actress?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE first week of the Nutmeg Players, while they
rehearsed their first bill, <i>The Petrified Forest,</i> and
cleaned the theatre of its winter accumulation of dust and
cobwebs and the smell of mice, was not so wearing. It was merely
slightly hysterical.</p>

<p>There were so many characters in the <i>Forest</i> cast that
all the men apprentices had to be used, though their theatrical
experience may have been nothing more than singing 'I Love My
Little Christmas Lamb' at the Congregational Church at the age of
six. So it was that Bethel and Toni, themselves still uncast for
a play, had the derisive agony of seeing Pete Chew and the
lugubriously artistic Harry Mihick rehearsing as the two
telegraph linemen.</p>

<p>During the moments when they could escape from errands and
from the School, the two girls, looking owlish and chewing gum,
perched in the highest seats of the theatre and glowered at Pete,
trying to look lounging and easy at a caf&eacute; table
(represented, during rehearsals, by a broken stool), and
repeating the line, 'Oh, is God a Russian?' as though it were a
funeral speech.</p>

<p>Roscoe Valentine, directing, was still patient so early in the
season. He didn't do anything more temperamental than pull his
nose and flap his fingers like antennae as he begged, 'Chew.
Please! You're supposed to be derisive.'</p>

<p>'Derisive?... I see... <i>Derisive!'</i> whimpered
Pete.</p>

<p>'God <i>is</i> a Russian, or he wouldn't let that hot-water
bottle act! It's a plot!' snarled Toni.</p>

<p><br>
The theatre school was opened on Monday morning. It consisted
of a barn, a platform, some chairs, the sixteen apprentices (as
many of them, at any given time, as were not running errands or
rehearsing) and the teacher. The teacher had arrived that morning
and, sitting down in the barn, Bethel gasped to discover that she
was Miss Maggie Sample, that handsome and bitter character
actress whom she had seen seven years ago with the McDermids in
<i>The Silver Cord.</i> Miss Sample would be all of fifty-seven
now. The pickle had not sweetened in these years.</p>

<p>Bethel was not yet aware of the basic rule of the theatre that
if you ever act with anyone, you will act with him again; that if
you played St. Clair's daughter in <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> under
canvas on the Dakota circuit in 1893, you must not be surprised
to find yourself cast as St. Clair's mother in a Gotham Theatre
Alliance comedy by Molnar in 1940, with one of the original
walk-on bloodhounds now advanced to a Pekingese in the boudoir
scene.</p>

<p>Maggie Sample did not remember her; looked at her bleakly as
Bethel gave her name.</p>

<p>'Where from?' said Miss Sample.</p>

<p>'Sladesbury! And I saw you in <i>The Silver Cord</i> and
<i>Dulcy,</i> Miss Sample.'</p>

<p>'Sladesbury? Where's that? And what was <i>The Silver
Cord?</i> Oh yes. Was that the operetta about the Turkish harem?
Where I tried to sing the part of the Oldest Wife? And got
strangled with a silver cord? Was I lousy!'</p>

<p><br>
'Between my own cultural view of the drama and the practical
experience of my resident teacher and the numerous visiting
lecturers, I think I may say that every aspirant in our School of
the Theatre acquires a complete and at once emotional and
scholarly concept of acting as an art,' Roscoe Valentine was
saying, just then, to a reporter from the New Haven <i>Journal
&amp; Courier.</i></p>

<p>And he may have been right. Maggie Sample knew her craft as
thoroughly as she hated it. If only, Bethel sighed from time to
time throughout the summer, Miss Sample wouldn't find it a
consolation to assure all young actresses that they would soon be
as old and lonely and wretched as herself, with breath as short
and hearts that pounded with like terror.</p>

<p>Bethel was never going to be that old&mdash;not at ninety, she
swore.</p>

<p><br>
After a five-minute speech, which consisted entirely in
directing them not to be fools and particularly not to suppose
that, because they had been stars in little theatres or in
colleges, they could act, Miss Sample assigned to the students
detached portions of plays to present next Friday.</p>

<p>Bethel was to play Fanny in <i>Hindle Wakes.</i> She went off
to study, and Maggie Sample to sleep. Maggie had spent the night,
till five a.m., in sitting up with her mother, who was
eighty-three years old, in a gas-smelling one-room flat in
Harlem. She had supported her mother for forty years, and every
day for forty years her mother had told someone or other that
Maggie was a success and sent her so little money because she was
keeping two lovers. Maggie hated the stage. Maggie's mother loved
the stage. Maggie's mother hated Maggie. Maggie had always been
too busy to think about whether she hated her mother. She had
also been too busy to remember ever having played, in <i>The
Silver Cord,</i> a part about too much mother.</p>

<p><br>
The part of Second Lineman, to be enacted by Mr. Peter Chew in
<i>The Petrified Forest,</i> contained exactly eighty words. But
to Pete the part was longer than Hamlet's, and more confusing
than the Theory of Relativity. The one speech, 'Sure! Go ahead,
Pop. Change the subject', he could, without half trying and in
the space of not over five minutes, render as, 'You bet, Dad, go
on and change the subject', and 'Sure, Pop, go the subject', and
'That's right, pop the subject', and sixteen other versions, all
fascinating.</p>

<p>Naturally, he cried for a lot of cuing. He got Bethel, Toni
Titmus, Iris Pentire, Anita Hill, and four other girl
apprentices, all young, to cue him, and with each of them (so
they treacherously reported to one another, with details,
laughing as women do) he found that it strengthened his memory to
put his arm around her.</p>

<p>Between cuing Pete, avoiding Pete, going out to borrow chairs
for the set, going to the bank and to the station for Roscoe, and
learning her practice lines in <i>Hindle Wakes,</i> Bethel was
hurled forward to Friday. Only once did she feel that she was
getting something. She listened to a conference between the
company electrician and Cynthia Aleshire and Fletcher Hewitt on
the setting for <i>Petrified Forest.</i></p>

<p>'You got to give me a better light than that bastard amber,'
wailed Cynthia. 'I want more pink in it. I want to get the
feeling of the whole, lonesome desert through that window.'</p>

<p>'Window too big anyway. Whole right wall of a barbeque
lunch-room one big window. 'Tisn't realistic!' complained
Fletcher.</p>

<p>'I don't care if it isn't. I want to get the feeling.'</p>

<p>Bethel crept backstage and looked at the ground row of cut-out
cactus and mesas standing against the half-circle of the
cyclorama; at the bank of lights on the floor of the stage and
the border lights overhead. She peeped into Cynthia's
thumb-greased manual of lighting and read, as though they were
the names of the five sweet symphonies, about Opalescent Lamp
Dips, Sprayed Coatings, Glass Colour Caps, Gelatin Colour Media
and Sheets of Transolene. She looked up at the scenery hanging in
the fly loft&mdash;a ca&ntilde;on turned upside down. She
remembered, embarrassed, that she had been content in <i>A Doll's
House</i> with scenery that had served before that for the
interior of a Washington mansion in <i>The Witching Hour.</i></p>

<p>She hadn't even known just what lights Miss Bickling had used.
She remembered, guiltily, that she had thought then that the
actors were all that mattered in a play. Now she saw all the
people of the theatre&mdash;director, scene designer, actors,
electricians, stagehands, stage manager, musicians, author
(though she wasn't yet enlightened enough to include the audience
and the wicked producer)&mdash;as a fraternity, the sincerest
democracy in the world, united to create in a troubled world an
illusion of strength and beauty and hope and honour and noble
wrath that were more real than reality. In that mangy little
wooden theatre by a pebble-scattered beach she was confirmed in
her faith.</p>

<p><br>
On Friday afternoon was the school recital from <i>Hindle
Wakes,</i> with Bethel as the Lancashire mill girl, Fanny, who
has been off on an illicit week end, and with Harry Mihick as her
worried father, Marian as her shocked mother. Bethel had no
notion of the Lancashire intonation, but then neither had the
others, and they all played it in cockney, with overtones of
Kansas and a dash of dry Vermont.</p>

<p>The set consisted of five chairs&mdash;two of them
representing a table and a dresser&mdash;up on the barn platform;
the audience, of Maggie Sample and five apprentices, all looking
up with idiotic blankness, like six Supreme Court justices
rehearing a tax case. Bethel did not mind. She carried her own
fire and applause.</p>

<p>She had been devout in her study of the role; she had not
merely learned the lines, but had, she believed, come to know
Fanny and to love her. She had been surprised to encounter an
English girl so independent and forthright, loving her family but
directing her own life. Everyone said that only American girls
were like that, and Bethel wanted to let the world know about
this social discovery.</p>

<p>From the moment when she entered (from behind a chair) with a
cheerful 'Well, you didn't expect me as soon as this, I'll bet',
she was Fanny, not Bethel Merriday; and as Fanny she desperately
justified her right to hide her sweetheart's name. When Roscoe
Valentine and Fletcher Hewitt stumbled in and solemnly added
themselves to her audience, she was not above the vulgarity of
noticing them, but they made her only the more zealous to present
her case.</p>

<p>What threw her was Harry Mihick.</p>

<p>Marian Croy was good enough as the mother, but as the father,
Harry was King Lear played by a Marx brother in a red beard. He
moaned, he staggered, he slapped his forehead. Bethel was so
fascinated that she forgot to be earnest, toward the end, and
merely fed in her lines, and did not realize that she had let
down till it was over.</p>

<p>The three aspirants sat and prepared to be admired. Maggie
Sample sighed, put on eyeglasses, sighed again and spoke:</p>

<p>'Miss Croy, you weren't bad. But a little less elocution and
sweetness and melody. You're not a Y.W.C.A. secretary or a
lobbyist for free tariff on canary birds. You're a
Percheron-built housewife in an industrial town, and you worry
about the taxes and the price of beer, and your feet hurt.</p>

<p>'Mr. Mihick, I take it that you know you can never get on the
stage, anywhere, in anything?'</p>

<p>'Y-you think so,' groaned Harry.</p>

<p>'Don't you?'</p>

<p>'Well, maybe I can spread the gospel of the theatre through
Missouri and Kansas.'</p>

<p>'Yes, you stick to that... And now you, Miss&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Merriday.'</p>

<p>'Miss Merriday... Where were you born?'</p>

<p>'In Sladesbury.'</p>

<p>'Where's that?'</p>

<p>'Why, right here in Connecticut. I told you. Don't you
remember?'</p>

<p>'I do not remember! I'm surprised to find that you are a
Yankee. For all their faults, such as suspicion of everyone that
doesn't smell of wood mould and furniture polish, the Yankees do
have a nice reticence. But you played this like an up-and-coming
Middle Western girl who thinks the purpose of life is to yell at
men and poke them in the ribs and keep on getting everything she
can out of them&mdash;from Wrigley's gum and pineapple ice-cream
soda to marriage lines and a trip to Los Angeles.'</p>

<p>Bethel looked down at the unsmiling apprentices, the kind but
now expressionless Fletcher Hewitt, the rococo but now
expressionless Mr. Valentine. She couldn't believe that this was
happening to her. Her lifelong career as an actress was being
ended, and her old friend Miss Sample was going on:</p>

<p>'You were too pert. You thought too well of yourself. Here
you're supposed to be a North Country millhand who's independent
only because she had to earn her living, but you acted as if you
were a WPA investigator scolding a "case". Oh, Miss Bethel
Merriday, you were ba-a-a-a-d!'</p>

<p>Into the grey silence swam Roscoe.</p>

<p>'Bethel, let me give you a few practical hints. Your
voice&mdash;your projection. Don't try to do it all with your
throat; use your lungs; use your diaphragm for volume. Every day,
for ten minutes, I want you to do this exercise. Stand straight,
with your belly completely drawn in; take the deepest possible
breath, and exhale it, with a good loud hiss, between your closed
teeth, so it won't go too fast.</p>

<p>'And voice projection is just as much mental as it is
physical. Look up at the top balcony, way, way up there, and make
sure your voice reaches them, and forget the carriage trade down
in the pit.</p>

<p>'And when you sit, don't slouch. Let the gallery see your
face, not just the pretty top of your head. No matter how relaxed
you are, keep your spine firm, as an axis that you can revolve on
in any direction. Picture it as a flexible steel rod, going right
up through you and supporting you.</p>

<p>'But the biggest lesson in acting is never to do anything
except for a psychological purpose. Don't walk over and open the
door just because it's in the script. Why are you opening that
door? Are you sore at somebody and walking out on him? Are you
going uptown to buy some face powder? Are you afraid there's a
dead man lying out there in the hall? Never do anything unless
you understand <i>why.'</i></p>

<p>Roscoe had risen. He whirled now on the five apprentices in
the audience, who had all been staring at Bethel, half amused.
'And that goes for all the rest of you, d'you understand? Bethel
was terrible, but the rest of you are just as bad. You're all
terrible. If any of you want to go back to the soda counter, that
will be all right with Miss Sample and me. Good day, young ladies
and gentlemen!'</p>

<p><br>
Fletcher walked with her to the dormitory.</p>

<p>He was to her the man who would always be there when she
needed him, who would be always a little more understanding than
anybody else and sometimes more intelligent, who, as stage
manager, knew everybody's part and everybody's sorrows, whom she
could almost love, and whom she would always forget the moment
any more demanding male came in sight. She knew him deeply after
this one week; she could never know him any better after thirty
years.</p>

<p>'Well?' said Bethel to Fletcher.</p>

<p>'I thought you were going to be idiot enough to say "Here's
where I go home",' said Fletcher.</p>

<p>'I did say it! But then I decided that's what I was here
for&mdash;to get hell&mdash;to get training.'</p>

<p>'Good girl. Maybe some day you'll be an actress!'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<p class="first">SHE had quarter-hours when she was free to sneak
into the theatre and watch rehearsals of <i>The Petrified
Forest.</i> As Alan, the gentlemanly, the poetic, the rather
seedy hero, Andy Deacon doffed all his humorous briskness, and in
every word and twitchy movement of his hands was the wrecked
dreamer. As Gabrielle, the lunch-room waitress who believed in
Fran&ccedil;ois Villon, Mahala Vale was smaller than herself (but
that wasn't so hard; even Bethel knew about flat heels versus
high ones) and harder and quicker and more avid of love.</p>

<p>It was strange to Bethel, and a little embarrassing, that
while she pored on Andy, he really did not know that she existed.
She guessed that to him she was merely a smaller face than most
among nine blank faces of girl apprentices. He had never
addressed her by any more intimate form than, 'Oh,
darling&mdash;look here, sweetest', and in the world of the
theatre, that constitutes ignoring a person.</p>

<p>But Bethel could sit in the auditorium and hate Mahala and her
preenings toward Andy and her dove calls and her wrigglings and
her scarlet smiling lips, as large as a clown's, just as
comfortably as though Mahala&mdash;or Andy&mdash;knew it.</p>

<p><br>
Pete Chew had the persistence which, in the American credo,
must bring success. If for twenty times a girl shrank and bleated
when he tried to kiss her, it was his belief that on the
twenty-first she would seize him around the neck and faint in
beatitude.</p>

<p>So the Bethel who had never before learned the maturity of
making a snug bundle of her secret thoughts and throwing them at
somebody's face was driven into learning it quickly.</p>

<p>The precise time was at 7.25 p.m. on Sunday, June 26th,
between supper and the beginning of the Nutmeg Players' first
dress rehearsal, and the place was the workshop, whither Roscoe,
in panic, had sent Bethel to try and find a prop shotgun which
was, actually, still in the Grampion Centre Hardware Store &amp;
Undertaking.</p>

<p>On her shoulder she felt the familiar soft hot paw of Pete
Chew. She turned.</p>

<p>'Will you quit trying to manhandle me? I'm sick of it!'</p>

<p>'Why, Beth, I'm shocked at you! I always thought you were a
college woman and a lady, and here you bellyachin' like a Polack
hired girl.'</p>

<p>'I'm just learning it. You wait till I get it rehearsed!'</p>

<p>'But I thought you liked me.'</p>

<p>'Pete, I think you ought to be the first to know. You see, I'm
in love with&mdash;with&mdash;'</p>

<p><i>'Who?'</i></p>

<p>'With John Barrymore!'</p>

<p><br>
It was a very good dress rehearsal, promising a successful
showing of <i>The Petrified Forest.</i> Roscoe and Andy had for
cheer the facts that: (1) nobody knew any of his lines&mdash;any
whatsoever; (2) Mahala was, just now, discovered to believe that
Gabby was false and pretentious, whereas she should be simple and
real; (3) none of the property guns would go off; (4) the curtain
stuck; (5) the prop whisky bottle, Jason's Sam Browne belt, and
one shotgun were all missing; and (6) three times during the
rehearsal Roscoe screamed like a switch engine.</p>

<p>So the wise veterans like Doc Keezer knew that at the opening,
twenty-four hours from now, everything would be perfect; they so
assured the almost weeping Bethel; and on Monday night, so it
was.</p>

<p><br>
Along with Toni and Anita Hill, Bethel was drafted as an usher
that week and had her first chance to study an audience. All the
girl ushers discarded their shorts and slacks and wore their best
afternoon dresses. As ushers they did not feel servile, but like
hostesses and just a little superior to the superior summer
theatregoers who never really looked at them. Doubtless, hundreds
of readers of this history will have been shown to their seats at
Grampion by Bethel Merriday without their now remembering it.</p>

<p>There are only three classes in the audience in a city
theatre: those who can afford to go&mdash;of whom some really
like the play; those who want it thought that they can afford to
go&mdash;they are too engaged in hoping they look like regular
and expert theatregoers to have much attention left for the play
itself; and the students up in the gallery, who love the play
savagely or hate it volubly.</p>

<p>But at Grampion, in vacation time, the country audience was as
mixed as an aquarium: the young station taxi driver and his
beautiful wife, and old Mr. Chamberlain Brewster Boles, the
banker, from his castle on Crab Neck, tobacco growers and apple
growers and dairymen from up the river, the Cap'n who took
summerites out fishing in his motor dory, a flutter of young
married couples from New York, on vacation, the Grampion Centre
doctor, grey, and his young wife, pink and stage-struck, a garage
proprietor, and the Baroness Pont d'Ev&ecirc;que
<i>(n&eacute;e</i> Quimby). They all thought fairly well of
themselves as individual human beings, each with his prides and
secrets and sins; they felt patronizing in attending the little
theatre; and they did not notice the neat, quick, dark-eyed thin
girl who ushered them to their seats. But she was sorry for all
of them, that they should be such laymen, such pathetic
outsiders, and not allowed backstage.</p>

<p>She hoped, on behalf of the poor heathen souls of the
audience, that they were sufficiently advanced toward salvation
to be able to see that this was, approximately, the greatest
performance of the greatest play in the greatest&mdash;well,
anyway, the best-managed&mdash;playhouse in the history of the
theatre. She trembled with desire to tell somebody how privileged
she felt.</p>

<p>There had never been such a stage-set as Cynthia's: the whole
desert, thousands of shining miles of it, did come through the
right-wall window. There had never been so touchingly lost a
vagrant as Andy, so brave and mad a girl as Mahala (and if Bethel
could admit it, how exquisite Mahala must have been!), so coldly
terrifying a gang leader as Tudor Blackwall, so comic an old
Westerner as Doc Keezer, impersonating Gramp. Bethel proudly knew
that she mustn't disgrace her high office as theatre usher by
guffawing, and she stood at attention at the back of the little
hall, hands clenched with a mirth that scoured through her like
fever, as Doc cackled, 'Don't think he really meant to do me any
real harm. Just wanted to scare the pants off of me'.</p>

<p>This was life! At its highest!</p>

<p>So the ecstatic Bethel.</p>

<p><br>
The theatre audience, driving over a sandy side road and
parking in long grass which wet their delicate patent-leather
slippers or white buckskin shoes, saw an old brown wooden church,
not very well repainted. They might still have expected to find a
pious meeting except that on the broad stoop were box trees in
wine jars from Italy, and over the grained front door an arclight
illuminating the sign:</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">ANDREW DEACON<br>
MAHALA VALE<br>
TUDOR BLACKWALL<br>
in<br>
<big>THE PETRIFIED FOREST</big><br>
<i>A Desert Melodrama</i></p>

<p><br>
The entryway had been turned into a lobby by the installation
of a box office that was a bright blue coop, in which the
apprentices took their turns sweating and fidgeting and
misrepresenting the excellence of the tickets. In the country,
every ticket buyer felt it only neighbourly to explain, 'I didn't
know's we'd come to-night&mdash;looked like rain all this
week&mdash;but I said to Cousin Edie&mdash;from Elizabeth, New
Jersey&mdash;she's staying with us for a couple weeks&mdash;I
said to her, "Oh, let's go and see a real bang-up theatre show
for once," I said... Is a dollar sixty-five the lowest you got?
My! Just for a theatre ticket!'</p>

<p>The lobby walls were lined with grey celotex, on which Mr.
Valentine had hung prints of Degas ballet girls.</p>

<p>The inside of the theatre auditorium, all in slate-painted
pine, with a peaked ceiling, was frankly a wooden box; and the
seats were aged opera chairs, on steps. But from Bordeaux, Roscoe
had brought, as traveller-curtain, an impish, gay tapestry with
knights and dryads and long-necked greyhounds among intricate
blue-and-saffron boughs, and it proclaimed, 'Forget the drab box
of the auditorium, forget the drab boxes of your daily lives.
Here is the gate to imagination.'</p>

<p><br>
The metropolitan newspapers had for years found it a very
sound and inimitably novel joke to refer to the summer stock
theatres as 'the strawhats' and 'the barn theatres'. Well, if the
Grampion structure was not a barn but a decayed church, it did at
least have, backstage, something like a mess of old horse stalls.
The dressing-rooms, the toilets, the property room, the costume
room, the storage room, they were a honeycomb of thin coops, made
of old boards with dark nail holes dotting them, and repaired
with bits of old lath. They were in a crazy planless plan, so
that you could, even in this tiny theatre, get lost. And Bethel
loved those dark passages between rickety walls. They were the
alleyways of a crazy city of dreams.</p>

<p><br>
When the curtain had opened, to-night, the spectator (other
than Bethel) would have seen a fairly good stock-company
performance of <i>The Petrified Forest,</i> distinguished by the
facts that Mahala was beautiful, in a stately, benign way; that
she was so unsuited to the role of poetic desert rat that the
director must have done his casting in the cellar, by touch; and
that Doc Keezer, as Gramp, was a really good character actor. The
rest was silence.</p>

<p><br>
Bethel went backstage once during the show, for no other
reason than to assure herself that she could. All she said was
'Hello' to Iris Pentire&mdash;so successfully made up to look
thirty-five, as Mrs. Chisholm, that she looked fifty.</p>

<p>During the intermission she stood at attention, but she looked
out at the strolling audience and vigilantly listened for
comments. When a vacationing New York stockbroker said 'Not too
bad', Bethel wanted to bite him. When the taxi driver's wife
gurgled, 'It was lovely&mdash;I was so scared', then Bethel
almost kissed her.</p>

<p>In intermissions they walked blissfully not on a New York side
street, of coal chutes and high dusty stoops and Chinese
beaneries and thin evasive hotels and Greek bars and clammy
persistent packs of autograph hunters, but on the
dandelion-starred grass, under the elms, in sea breeze. It was
the linden trees of Weimar to Bethel, and Stratford in
Maytime.</p>

<p><br>
There were some seven reviews of the play in the New Haven and
New London papers. Bethel still has all of them in her scrap
album. Her prize among them was written by a red-faced man who,
under the name of Black Bart, did sports and harbour news for the
New London <i>Era,</i> and who wanted to write plays:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote"> If New York theatrical producers could
occasionally persuade themselves to give up going to Hollywood to
try to get jobs, or to London to try to meet a duke, in between
their spasms of actual producing of plays, and if they could be
persuaded to have a little interest in their own future careers,
they would take a few days off and look over the summer theatres,
at which they scoff but which, as a matter of fact, are about the
only source, outside of some dramatic schools, for the Eugene
O'Neills and Walter Hustons of to-morrow.</p>

<p class="quote">That was brilliantly seen last night at Point
Grampion, in <i>The Petrified Forest,</i> the opening gun in the
Nutmeg Players' theatrical barrage for this summer. If perhaps
some of the actors weren't yet as heavily loaded as the Broadway
big guns, a lot of them are going to be. The play had the speed
of a clipper, with humour and poetic qualities well emphasized.
Andrew Deacon, who last summer pleased all hands by his robust
characterization of Ethan Frome, is now winning as an English
poet in hard luck, and the new leading lady, Miss Mahala Vale, is
exquisite in the role of an Edna Millay in a dog-wagon.
Interviewed afterwards in his dressing-room, Mr. Deacon, who
hopes to find time even in his eighteen-hours-a-day in the
theatre to enter the New London Tennis Tournament this summer,
having been one of the best players for Old Eli some six years
ago...</p>

<br>

<p>But Bethel cared less for the end of the report, in which it
was stated that&mdash;</p>

<br>


<p class="quote">Young Miss Iris Pentire who, seen in her
dressing-room, was exquisite as a skein of corn-coloured silk, is
indeed a find, for so clever is she in make-up and impersonation
that this lovely child gave all the impression of a
stuffed-shirtwaist female in the dubious thirties. She is a
wow.</p>

<br>

<p>Bethel reflected:</p>

<p>'Maybe Iris is better than I am.</p>

<p>'Maybe she's better than I'll ever be.</p>

<p>'She is <i>not</i> a wow!'</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE apprentices were permitted each to appear in
three plays during the season. Not till the fourth play, <i>Stage
Door,</i> by Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman, which opened on
July 18th, did Bethel have her chance.</p>

<p>The sensation of the two weeks after <i>The Petrified
Forest</i> was the appearance, like a transitory comet&mdash;a
rather old and tired-out comet that had gone a long way&mdash;of
Miss Nile Sanderac as guest star in <i>Candida.</i></p>

<p>She was the first really distinguished actress that Bethel had
ever seen in the flesh&mdash;the exquisite flesh, shining,
ageless, more than human.</p>

<p>Everybody in the United States&mdash;'everybody' indicating
that 00.05 per cent of the population that cared a hang about the
theatre&mdash;knew that Nile Sanderac's real name was Nelly
Sanders; that she was half Irish, half Yankee. Her career had
been energetic. She had appeared in eleven witty plays about
London society, ten plays about Park Avenue society, nine plays
about Long Island society, and one play about the wrongs of lap
dogs. She had been married four times. She was a friend of Gene
Tunney, Grover Whalen, Dwight Fiske, the Duke of Westminster,
Heywood Broun, Professor Millikan and Representative Sol Bloom.
She was forty years old. At least. Her hair had, at various
epochs, been mouse, chestnut, black, gold, grey, platinum, and
gold again. She had given away, to various worthless but pleasant
males, over $42,000. She owed, to various jewellery shops,
dressmakers and hotels, over $48,000. She had a bad temper and a
kind heart. Her pure shoulders enabled her to wear low black
evening gowns to advantage. She spoke French absolutely, and she
had never read one book clear through.</p>

<p>Incidentally, she was a very good actress.</p>

<p>The Nutmeg Players did not see much of Miss Sanderac, outside
rehearsals. She didn't stay even in the exclusiveness of the
House, with Roscoe and Andy and Mahala and Tudor Blackwall, but
at the tapestry-brick mansion of the rich Jeddabys, in Grampion
Centre. Always, Miss Sanderac was half shabby, in grey suits or
spinsterish dresses of grey cr&ecirc;pe de Chine. She seemed to
Bethel to have no personal life whatever: she didn't even scold
her silent coloured maid or shriek at Roscoe for shrieking. Just
once did Miss Sanderac come alive for Bethel and betray that she
had private life in plenty&mdash;when Bethel saw a puffy man with
puffy eyes and a grey moustache pouring out champagne for Miss
Sanderac in her dressing-room, and, afterward, taking her off in
a limousine. It all dated 1906, sighed Bethel.</p>

<p>Yet every apprentice on the lot, particularly Bethel, loved
Nile Sanderac and hoped to be able to die for her. For she smiled
at them, a special smile reserved for actors, not the mock-humble
grimace she gave to barbarian outsiders; not a stingy smile, but
a large one, that showed all her excellent teeth. The smile said
that they were all comrades and fellow mummers, rogues and
vagabonds, and that laymen were pretty funny.</p>

<p>But that smile was a wall, too, that protected her. Day after
day, while the fledgelings expected her to go farther and say
something cheerful and intimate, like 'The rehearsals aren't
going as bad as you'd think', it became more evident that she had
a low opinion of Mr. Roscoe Valentine, a high and lively opinion
of Mr. Andrew Deacon, a fellow-workman liking for Doc Keezer, and
of the others, no opinion at all.</p>

<p>Poor Andy, blundering as bountifully as any other young
collegian, tried to persuade Miss Sanderac to like his Mahala,
who was not in the <i>Candida</i> cast and therefore sulkily
invisible for a while. Sitting in the grass before the porch of
The House, Bethel heard Miss Sanderac crying to Andy, 'Oh, Andy,
don't you want to drive me to Clinton for dinner? We can get back
here before you have to make up.' And heard Andy loyally trying
to drag in his pet gazelle, with:</p>

<p>'I'd love to go, Nile. How about taking Mahala with us?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I guess we won't have time, after all,' sniffed Miss
Sanderac. And still Andy did not learn. He cried to the great
lady, 'I do wish you could have seen Mahala in <i>You Cannot
Dispossess Our Souls.</i> She was swell&mdash;absolutely like a
young prophetess!'</p>

<p>'In <i>what?'</i></p>

<p>'In <i>You Cannot</i>&mdash;Oh, you heard me, I won't say it
again.'</p>

<p>'I should think not, darling. "You Can't Possess Us." What a
title! What is it?'</p>

<p>'It's a play about share croppers.'</p>

<p>'No. You're kidding.'</p>

<p>'Oh, quit it. And she <i>was</i> swell!'</p>

<p>'Who was swell?'</p>

<p>'Mahala Vale.'</p>

<p>'Who's Mahala Vale?'</p>

<p>'Oh, dry up.'</p>

<p>'That's right, darling. Go on. Use me as you will. Yell at me.
Beat me. Divorce me. You never did divorce me, did you?'</p>

<p>'I would, if I had you.'</p>

<p>'Oh course you would, my pie-lamb. Wait! Aren't you the young
man I just met this week? We haven't been married, not ever, have
we?'</p>

<p>'We have not, darling. Not yet.'</p>

<p>'And you've never even married some little number like Mahala?
Oh, dearie me, you <i>have</i> been busy with the Career!'</p>

<p><br>
Andy Deacon could not have known that the slight, pleasant
dark girl, sitting on the grass, chin in hand, her back to
them&mdash;Bess Meredith her name was, or something of the
sort&mdash;was not only devouring their words but scolding him
ferociously:</p>

<p>'Oh, Andy, my dear boy, what a fool you are... And so sweet...
 And so dumb!... I know, dear; this Sanderac woman is ten
or twelve years older than you are, and she's hard-boiled and
she's extravagant, and she doesn't care any more for the
spotlight than she does for heaven. But how much better it would
be if you could fall in love with someone like her, that is
honest and stands on her own feet and that can <i>act,</i>
instead of these camelia-scented sharks like Mahala or Joan,
that'll get everything they can out of you, that'll never stop
acting off stage or start acting on!... I'll bet Mahala has
never kissed you&mdash;or anyway, she held on to the kiss and
snatched it back. And of course you'd never know that a really
nice girl like me ever existed!'</p>

<p><br>
Since she was not rehearsing for <i>Candida,</i> Mahala had
the daytimes this week vacant, from her favourite rising
hour&mdash;noon&mdash;till early supper. Bethel innocently
wondered what this young actress, not without experience and
ambition, would do with her freedom.</p>

<p>Read? Exercise? Go and be noble about something?</p>

<p>Well, Mahala slept. And she also sat on the beach and looked
sorry for herself.</p>

<p>Bethel too was lonely&mdash;when she had time to think about
it. The offended Pete Chew had taken Toni away from her; she
could never get through the veil of sweet, shining nothing that
surrounded Iris Pentire; and Fletcher Hewitt and Walter Rolf were
as pleasant as the west wind and just as impersonal. But she
understood loneliness. She was used to being lonely; she always
had been, always would be, unless Fate flourished the one
miraculous lover... who would surely look extraordinarily like
Andy.</p>

<p>She watched Mahala looking for a confidante to share her free
week; poking a mental finger into the ribs of Iris, Toni, Marian
Croy, Anita Hill, and giving them up as too commonplace to
appreciate her. At last, rather obviously for a lady actress, she
decided that Bethel would have to do, as servant of her bosom.
Bethel told herself that she wasn't at all flattered&mdash;and
was thoroughly flattered and excited by the favour of this wise,
experienced old actress of twenty-six. They sat yawning or
laughing on the beach, Mahala in a bathing suit so tight, so
white, with such handsome long white legs, that she would have
seemed embarrassingly naked, had she not too much resembled an
unbreathing marble statue.</p>

<p>'Oh, this place is such a bore,' whined Mahala. 'I think I'd
of done better to go out to Southampton, on Long
Island&mdash;Mrs. Fribble invited me to go out and spend all
summer&mdash;you know, the Montgomery Fribbles, he's the banker;
they got scads of money and a yacht. Roscoe is too pixie&mdash;he
couldn't direct swatting a fly&mdash;and the stock company are
all such hams.'</p>

<p>'Oh, not Andy, Mahala!'</p>

<p>'No, he's a pretty fair actor&mdash;if he doesn't tackle any
parts that require subtlety. I had the most awful time carrying
him in <i>Petrified Forest.</i> He would play Alan, who ought to
be all delicacy, like a Yale basketball player. And he's not so
young&mdash;he's older than I am; not so young that you can
excuse him for falling for an old jalopy like Nile, who'll be
playing Irish grandmothers in Hollywood in another year.'</p>

<p>'Mm,' said Bethel.</p>

<p>'You're lucky, Beth. Of course it doesn't make any difference
to you what second-raters everybody here are, as long as they're
fun to play around with. I notice this Chew boy is interested in
you (oh, I never miss anything; that's my business, as an
actress!). He's a little dumb, but he ties his ties well, and I
know he's got lots of money. You better grab him and marry
him&mdash;or else you might have to go back to your home town,
wherever that is. You're lucky not having the kind of
irresistible leaning toward a stage career that I'm cursed
with.</p>

<p>'It's all very well for me to get a lot of silly flattery
about my talent and beauty&mdash;and honestly, I'm so honest with
myself, I don't think I'm especially beautiful&mdash;but they're
like chains&mdash;they bind me to the theatre&mdash;people just
won't let me go and retire and live a quiet life, the way I'd
like to.</p>

<p>'Still, I'll admit there are rewards, when&mdash;only it
doesn't happen very often&mdash;these playwrights are such
dopes!&mdash;when you can get a play that's really worth
interpreting. I wish I were back in <i>You Cannot Dispossess Our
Souls.</i> Maybe it didn't run so very long, but the praise we
got&mdash;you never heard anything like it! Oh, the professional
critics ganged up on us, of course; they always do; they're
jealous of all brave new experiment. Brooks Atkinson said in the
New York <i>Times</i> that it was "dull though doubtless worthy",
and Dick Watts said in the <i>Herald-Tribune</i> that it was
"worthy though doubtless dull", and the second-string critic on
the <i>Sun,</i> he wrote almost a whole column&mdash;he said it
wasn't a play at all, but just a Communist attack on the Governor
of Oklahoma, and the <i>New Masses&mdash;they</i> said it was a
Trotsky-ist attack on Communism and Abraham Lincoln! But they
<i>all</i> said <i>I</i> was all right, and Ward Morehouse, he
had a note in his column that said I looked like Joan
Crawford.'</p>

<p>Mahala stopped, scratched her knee, looked at the sea,
apparently decided that all this water was pretty useless, and
sighed:</p>

<p>'I loved my role. I had such a good costume change. Here in
the first act I was the wife of the local doctor and I wore a
cocktail gown from Bergdorf Goodman's&mdash;it cost two hundred
bucks! The director kicked like a steer&mdash;he said it wasn't
suitable to an Oklahoma small town, but the producer was kind of
sweet on me&mdash;he was a Communist and <i>awfully</i> rich, his
father's a New York banker, he was a sweet boy, only kind of a
screwball&mdash;and he let me have it. And even the director came
to admit I was right, because it made such a swell contrast when
my husband gets bumped off and I'm a poor widow and living in a
share cropper's shack and I'm all in rags and barefoot&mdash;and
thank God I've got feet that will stand showing&mdash;look; see
how regular the toes are and what a high arch&mdash;and I was
kind of the queen of the share croppers, you might say&mdash;you
know, with my hair loose and a spotlight on me&mdash;and I led
the revolt&mdash;wow, it was colossal! Oh dear!'</p>

<p>Bethel was a skilful listener; always had been; and until Nile
Sanderac was gone and Andy again delivered to the arms&mdash;or
at least, the conversation&mdash;of Mahala, she was Mahala's
heart's-ease and swimming companion.</p>

<p>Mahala Vale was neither a fool nor entirely vicious. She was a
handsome young woman whose mind was flexible enough to give her a
high stand in the stage army&mdash;she would certainly some day
be one of the best of the second-rate actresses. There was one
small trouble with her: she could not conceive that any person or
any play or any historical event or any dollar in legal minted
coin could have any importance except in its relationship to
her.</p>

<p>Bethel had to admit that Mahala taught her several bits of
stage craftsmanship&mdash;all of the lowest and trickiest. You
must always assume, even if unfairly, insisted Mahala, that
almost any old trouper was at any moment likely to do anything
short of creeping up behind you and clapping on a red nose, to
turn the audience's attention from you to him.</p>

<p>He would stand facing the audience, with his back to you,
during your long, tear-dripping confession, and you could see
that he wasn't moving, not doing anything to throw you&mdash;no,
he was merely looking comically lugubrious, and twisting a coat
button, or running his fingers along the edges of his lapels. And
the dear old lady, the mother of the company, seated way down
right-stage&mdash;it wasn't her fault that you always got a wrong
laugh when you were gazing into the hero's eyes; all the old
darling had done was to light a cigarette as though she had
never, never smoked one of the horrid things before, and give a
dear little pussy sneeze.</p>

<p>Mahala said righteously: 'People that do lousy tricks like
that, they ought to be kicked off the stage. They have no
appreciation of the fact that you all got to work together to
make a perfect performance; and there isn't any one actor, no
matter how perfect he is, that's got a right to grab any
spotlight off anybody else. So when you run into scene stealers
like that, you just do something to throw 'em, and maybe that'll
teach 'em something!</p>

<p>'I remember once&mdash;it wasn't so long ago, either!&mdash;I
was playing <i>There's Always Juliet</i> in stock with a born
kleptomaniac. His ducky little trick was to pause before the last
three-four words of a speech, so you didn't know whether he was
going to give you your cue or not, and then if you jumped it,
he'd give you the cue after all. I fixed him! Middle of a speech,
I'd start to powder my nose, and just held it and stared at him.
I got him so embarrassed he used to blow every night!</p>

<p>''N' of course&mdash;and here's something you'll never learn
from Roscoe or any of these dramatic schools or those amateurs:
the way to cure upstaging is, if a guy starts going upstage, on
account of he thinks you'll turn your back to the audience and
follow him, why, you just deliberately go right down to the
foots, giving your lines to him over your shoulder&mdash;and if
you think the producer ain't around to catch you, you can even
kind of half wink at the audience so's they'll know what's up.
That'll show 'm!'</p>

<p>'I see,' said Bethel.</p>

<p><br>
Mahala had often spoken of the wealth and other charms of a
young Mrs. Tzirka who in summer lived at East Haddam, ten miles
from Grampion. Her husband was a stockbroker&mdash;but artistic;
she was the daughter of a wholesale jute dealer&mdash;but a very
wholesale dealer in the best of jute; one of the men who had
given jute its social significance.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Mahala permitted Bethel to borrow Pete's car and
drive her to the Tzirka villa.</p>

<p>'They won't want to see me,' Bethel had hesitated.</p>

<p>'Betty Tzirka'll most especially want you. Her brother, Jock,
a grand kid, 'll be there, and he'll think you're manna from
heaven.'</p>

<p>This, felt Bethel, was going to be her first real 'society
party' (she called it that) and a foretaste of the refined
exuberance, the beautiful people, she was going to know. She
pressed out her best silk print dress in the dormitory kitchen
and dared try some flowers in her hair.</p>

<p>When she saw the Tzirka house, she suddenly knew what sort of
a retreat she would have when she had become a reigning actress.
It was simple enough, a white salt-box cottage at peace with a
landscape of river and small hills and apple orchards, but it had
been made frivolous with a green-and-white awning and a
crazy-paving terrace, with green wicker chairs and glass-topped
small tables, concealed by an old stone wall above the roadway.
Here the Famous Merriday would read, rest and talk with
friends... talk about the stage, of course.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tzirka, thirty and slim and quivering and chemically
blonde, met them at the flight of stone steps up from the
roadway. Bethel was conscious of being regarded without
favour.</p>

<p>Mahala bellowed, 'Betty! Darling! Priceless! I've brought you
a lovely date for your imbecile Jock. Beth Merriday.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Tzirka crooned at Mahala in answer, and doves at twilight
were as nothing beside her: 'Oh, Maggie! Duckie! Darling! I'm
too-too sorry. Jock, the monster, has gone up to Hartford to see
the polo. But I'm enchanted to see you, Miss Merriday.' She
glanced at Mahala over Bethel's shoulder, with a distinct lack of
enchantment.</p>

<p>And now did Bethel find herself on-stage in a play with a
charming set of sun-speckled awning and wicker couches and
glasses of gin rickey and maple trunks, expected to snap up her
cues and give her lines at fever tempo. But the cues were in some
foreign language and she didn't know any of her lines. She didn't
even know what the play was about.</p>

<p>There had been provided, for Mahala and Mrs. Tzirka, two
slightly rancid young-old men, aged some indistinguishable where
between twenty-five and forty-five, both with double-breasted
grey flannel suits, black moustaches, meaningless yelps at the
names of meaningless people, and a way of looking at her as
though she were a milkmaid. <i>('Two</i> villains in the damn
play,' sighed Bethel.)</p>

<p>The four Sophisticated People were amused rather than annoyed
when she carried her rusticity so far as to refuse a gin rickey,
and they plunged into a coloured pool of gossip, of which Bethel
understood not a word:</p>

<p>'Simmy's going to divorce Natalie&mdash;he ran into her with
Tom at El Morocco and&mdash;you know how quick on the trigger he
is&mdash;he said, "Sweetie-pie, if you want a round-trip Reno
ticket, I think Tom and I ought to split the cost".'</p>

<p>'I don't believe a word of what she says about Joe always
nipping outside the house. I know for a fact he's completely
domesticated. It's the parlourmaid at home he's interested
in.'</p>

<p>'Xavier isn't broke. He's still got his annuity. Why, he's got
a Scotch grouse moor. No&mdash;fact&mdash;he's laid it out in his
own back yard.'</p>

<p>At what time in this feast Mahala rose with the younger of the
two beaux&mdash;or maybe it was the older&mdash;muttered 'Be back
in a moment', and drifted off with him to the birch grove beyond
the house; at what time Mrs. Tzirka followed with the other
prize, Bethel was not quite sure; but presently she was entirely
alone on the terrace, and she was alone for half an hour.</p>

<p>It was a half-hour of growing and healthy anger. She suddenly
knew that these slick people, with their references to polo and
yachting and Meadowbrook, were fakes; that they hadn't much even
of the one thing they worshipped&mdash;money. It was good that
they had not buttered her; their rudeness had made her less
likely ever again to mistake insolence for good manners.</p>

<p>It didn't much help her temper that they would have to drive
wildly back to Grampion and have only a sandwich for dinner, if
Mahala was to be in her dressing-room on time.</p>

<p>Bethel spent part of her isolation in imitating Mrs. Tzirka's
tricks of chain-smoking&mdash;taking five puffs of a cigarette,
exactly five, lighting another from it, and crushing out the
first with a nervous sidewise brushing motion; of showing her
knees and nervously, constantly, pulling down her skirt; of
arching her right big toe in her half-sandals; of widening her
eyes with glad surprise every time she looked at a male.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Tzirka galloped back, gushing 'So sor-ry&mdash;we
were looking at my espaliered pears,' Bethel bowed quite amiably
and in silence.</p>

<p>In the car Mahala shrieked, 'You were very rude, not even
saying good-bye to your hostess.'</p>

<p>Bethel was pleased to hear herself saying nothing whatever,
and pleased that, whether Mahala knew it or not, there was war
between them now, and no sex loyalty need stop her if she should
ever be able to protect Andy Deacon, her god and reckless child,
from the man-eating Mahala.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<p class="first">DURING the week of July 11th, while Nile
Sanderac was playing <i>Candida</i> in the evenings, Bethel was
rehearsing for <i>Stage Door,</i> along with the whole stock
company, all the apprentices, and a few summerite outsiders from
Grampion Centre, so large was the cast.</p>

<p>It was the first time that she had ever played with
professional actors, the first time she had tried to play comedy,
the first time she had had, to devour and treasure, real
professional typed 'sides' instead of a book; and in all, the
first time she had been entirely away from the pleasing school of
extempore acting, as demonstrated in Russian schools, in Point
Royal College, and on the bench in the Prindles' garage in
Sladesbury.</p>

<p>Andy was David and Mahala was Terry in <i>Stage Door;</i> Iris
was the Kaye who committed suicide; Toni was Jean Maitland, who
went to Hollywood; Pete Chew was the Texas student of acting;
while Harry Mihick suffered clear down to the bottom of his
sensitive boots as the coloured houseman.</p>

<p>Bethel's own role was that of Bernice Niemeyer, the curiosity-
driven girl who was the pest of the theatrical boarding-house.
She was glad that it wasn't merely a pretty <i>ing&eacute;nue</i>
part. She would have to represent a person as alien to herself as
Cleopatra, and that was the training for which she longed.</p>

<p>She had heard from Doc Keezer an old stock-company belief that
an actor ought not to learn his part before rehearsals, but
during them, so that he might tie up lines and business. But two
days before the terrifying Tuesday morning when they ran through
<i>Stage Door,</i> in the orchestra pit, in front of the
<i>Candida</i> set that stared down superciliously at their
ragged beginnings, Bethel knew all of the Bernice part, and she
had studied such speeches as 'I'd rather go out with the handsome
one' as though they were the last words of Fanny Kemble... She
<i>was</i> Bernice, sharp-nosed and brassy and a little touching
in her predestined failure. When Toni demanded, 'Shove over the
box of shredded hay' at Monday-morning breakfast, Bethel looked
sleepily at her, sighed and murmured, 'With the handsome
one'.</p>

<p>Whatever she did, remembering the stripes and afflictions she
had borne over Nora, Bethel was not going to overplay the role.
Her chief concern was that she had the very first speech, opening
the play.</p>

<p>All Saturday night she worked with the other apprentices
removing the <i>Night of January</i> 16<i>th</i> set and erecting
that of <i>Candida&mdash;</i>good work, for all its weariness;
laughing and clattering on and off the stage together; the boys
in undershirts and belted trousers, their shoulders glittering
with sweat, the girls in slacks or babyish gingham rompers,
allowed to stay up till dawn, feeling that they were doing
something pioneering, something important for the drama; never
stopping their boasting about what great actors they were going
to be, and swapping faith for faith. Yet again on Monday night,
after the <i>Candida</i> opening, Bethel stayed up till three,
studying her part at the dormitory dining table, under one
economical light (Roscoe saw to that), her legs twisted around a
table leg, her small tongue poked out of the corner of her small
red mouth. She was, in fact, so thorough about it that when she
came to the first rehearsal of <i>Stage Door,</i> at ten on
Tuesday, she couldn't remember a word, and had to read her part,
like all the others.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the play, set in the jumbled living-room
of a boarding-house for girl aspirants, one Olga is at the piano.
The busily intrusive Bernice stops her letter-writing to ask
about the music. So, beginning the rehearsal, looking not at Olga
but at Mr. Roscoe Valentine, who sat in the front row of the
orchestra, scratching one fat calf, his usual resemblance to a
ripe olive heightened by a dark green hunting jacket, Bethel gave
her first line, 'What's that you're playing?' like a plunging
sparrow beholding a very small worm. All the while she sat rigid
at the writing desk... She wasn't overplaying <i>this!</i></p>

<p>Roscoe bellowed.</p>

<p>Usually, Roscoe would only squeak, pipe, pullulate, whine,
whimper, bleat, blat or blether, but this was a man-sized
bellow.</p>

<p>'Bethel, have you by any chance looked at the role you're
supposed to play? Have you taken one single moment from the
golden joys of swimming and amorous dalliance to read maybe a
couple of Bernice's speeches? Did anyone tell you that they can
be procured in manuscript, all nicely typed? Also in book form,
at all literary emporia? Have you looked at the play? Do you even
know which character you are, by the wisdom of Mr. Deacon and
Miss Sample and myself, elected to portray?'</p>

<p>'I know it by heart.' Bethel wasn't sure whether she sounded
dangerous or blubbering. She felt both.</p>

<p>'Then you have no excuse. Or maybe no heart. Now let's save a
lot of time at the beginning, by getting your concept of the part
right. Bernice is supposed to be an active, inquisitive
busybody&mdash;a sort of oversized blue jay. When you give your
line&mdash;what is it?&mdash;"What's that you're
playing?"&mdash;make it as fresh and irritating as you can. And
don't sit there lolling. Get up. Make a cross. Look at Olga's
music, over her shoulder. Breathe down her neck. Make yourself as
generally objectionable as you can. Understand?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir, I'll try to be very objectionable.'</p>

<p>'On-stage, I meant.'</p>

<p><br>
Roscoe Valentine was a skyrocket; heated-looking for a time,
but cooling with celerity. For the first three or four out of the
twelve half-day rehearsal periods (including dress rehearsal, on
Sunday evening) he was savagely on time, and fussy as a
watchmaker. He would spend ten minutes in discussing whether, in
view of the fact that she was later to commit suicide, it would
be more significant for Kaye Hamilton&mdash;that is, Iris
Pentire&mdash;to turn right or left, when she sat down.</p>

<p>But each day Roscoe was later at rehearsals, each day he was
angrier when actors were even later than himself. By the end of
the week, when an actor would ask, 'Don't you think I ought to
cross here?' or 'What about my standing up before I answer?'
Roscoe would clasp his breast and moan, 'Hasn't anybody told you
the news? We're not rehearsing ten weeks! We're playing stock,
with six days for rehearsal! I'm directing for tempo and mood,
not for business. Can't you work out <i>anything</i> for
yourself?'</p>

<p>At his best, Roscoe could take out enough time in explaining
that he hadn't enough time for directing to have directed a
mystery melodrama.</p>

<p>Yet, with it all, Bethel learned more about the drama than she
had in four years of college library and of Miss Bickling. The
week was an idyll. Whatever foam from Roscoe had to be wiped
away, she was working with professional actors: Andy, Mahala,
Clara Ribbons, Doc Keezer, Tudor Blackwall, Maggie Sample.
Whenever she was sent up to Grampion Centre on an errand, though
the bright waters and dancing boats in the harbour beckoned, and
the fresh watery odour, she hastened back to the dark interior of
the scrubby theatre&mdash;a sacred chamber more illuminated than
the sun-washed ocean. Through the open doors she could see one
gay little pine tree against blue open sky. She felt that it was
her friend, her totem, and for her, just now, it was forest
enough.</p>

<p>The whole business of rehearsal had an exasperated
fascination. She had early noted that the actors who had the
fewest lines were those who were least likely to be ready for
entrance, and that the less they had to memorize, the less likely
they were to know it. Clara Ribbons never fully knew her lines
till the Wednesday of actual playing&mdash;with the pleasant
result that she threw everybody who played with her.</p>

<p>Bethel had resolved not to be one of these slovenly work-men,
doomed to dreariness, and yet&mdash;you waited so long for your
line to come; you sat out on the step, sniffing the air; someone
came and spoke to you; or perhaps, alone, you were going over and
over, over and over just the line you were waiting to give, and
then, in horror, you heard Roscoe yelping, 'Bernice! Where the
hell is Bernice? She's on now!' And you bolted into the rehearsal
space so rattled that you forgot the line that you had been
repeating till you knew it better than your own name! And Roscoe
scowled, as you stammered and felt sick and could remember
nothing at all. And Fletcher's kind voice gave you the first
words, and you said, 'Oh, of course!' And afterward, you laid
your forehead on your elbow on the upright piano and looked as
though you were weeping, but you were again repeating the
line&mdash;over and over, over and over.</p>

<p>The acutest twinge of rehearsals, always, was to be going on
smoothly, feeling that you were giving a speech perfectly, really
becoming Bernice Niemeyer, and then to be jerked out of the
superreality of the actor's unreality by Roscoe's sharp, 'All
right! We'll go back to David's entrance again'. That was like
stubbing your toe when running. And you stumbled thus, and your
heart stopped, twenty times an hour.</p>

<p>But the moment came, the last day, when you weren't saying
lines, weren't rehearsing, but playing, lost, absorbed, and that
was the second when you left the earth and were flying.</p>

<p><br>
During rehearsals the democratic comradeship of the theatre
was at its surest. While they were awaiting their scenes, they
sat back together, young and old, veteran and raw apprentice;
Andy in white flannel trousers unelegantly extended over the top
of a seat; Doc Keezer, as the Dr. Randall of the play (he would
always be playing doctors and ministers), sitting back with
closed eyes, so indifferent to everything but his own lines that
it is doubtful whether he knew what any of the play was about;
Iris with a small, set, misty smile ignoring the fact that Pete
Chew was gaping wistfully at her from the circle of Toni, Tudor
Blackwall, Mahala and Cy Fickerty, who were squatting on the
stage and shooting craps, while Harry Mihick looked on them in
sorrow at such desecration.</p>

<p>At rehearsals they were given to fantastic clothes: Walter
Rolf to overalls, sneakers and a lumberman's green-and-yellow
flannel shirt; Tudor Blackwall to mauve or maroon lounging
pyjamas. But whatever they wore, almost every man carried his
brown-covered part in his back pocket.</p>

<p>They were all serious children; very childish, very serious,
and apparently the only people still existent, in a world of
Hitler and Buchmanism, who enjoyed life. At every mistake, at
every dropped line, they laughed, and laughed together. And
together they shared the one, profoundest misery that a
rehearsing actor could know: that in a wooden summer theatre you
were not permitted to smoke. Oh, you <i>did</i> smoke, of course,
and flattened the butts with your toe, and kicked them under
chairs, but it took away the relaxation.</p>

<p>All over the theatre grounds, as they lay studying lines or
reading Steinbeck and Hemingway and Noel Coward or plain sleeping
and acquiring a sun tan, and at rehearsals, when they sat
slouching on their shoulder blades, listening, there was a
flaunting of brown legs of girls in shorts, but they were very
nice legs, and so numerous that they became as modest as noses.
Some of the students were aloof and arty, but most times they
were a gay crew&mdash;shouting at each other when they met for
rehearsals, goading those who were late&mdash;Pete Chew had the
disease of chronic, inevitable lateness&mdash;smiling generously
when a speech had been said with spirit, and fiendishly when an
apprentice had earnestly given the line 'How do you justify your
terms?' as 'How do you tustify your germs?'</p>

<p>With the most beautiful, baby-like absence of self-
consciousness, they were to be seen standing in corners, glaring
at a wall, and to it addressing hysterical lines of love. At
rehearsals the actor tossed an entirely imaginary cloak about his
shoulders as though it were heavy brocade, courteously removed a
hat made of air, and seriously set out on a suppositious table a
non-existent dinner, after sedulously cooking it on a kitchen
range that was a chair. In everything was the spirit of
children's play&mdash;not the rule-ridden, time-killing play of
adults that is a preparation for death, but the busy and
credulous play of children that is a preparation for life.</p>

<p><br>
She was rehearsing with Andy! She had a scene with Andy
alone!</p>

<p>He came on as the young movie producer&mdash;not only handsome
and rich but the donor of jobs; and as the desperately
pretentious job hunter, she pretended not to see him, preened
herself, and babbled to an imaginary auditor offstage: 'Yes,
Mattie, an actress's life is such an interesting one.... For
example, an English actress came into the office to-day. "My dear
Harry, how definitely ripping to see you. Definitely
ripping!"'</p>

<p>She worked desperately at acting Bernice desperately misacting
an Englishwoman, and when (on the stage!) Andy looked at her with
irritated pity, she was content.</p>

<p>Their relationship had now progressed so far that Andy usually
remembered her name.</p>

<p>The company were beginning to pair off: Andy and Mahala, Doc
Keezer and Clara Ribbons. Walter Rolf and Marian Croy read plays
aloud; Roscoe Valentine and Tudor Blackwall and Bruce Pasture
were usually together; and Bethel and Fletcher Hewitt, who was as
busy with script at rehearsals as he was with off-stage noises
and curtains during performances, were accepted as uninspired
friends. The only active triangle was of Pete Chew and Toni
Titmus and Iris Pentire.</p>

<p>Mr. Chew was a fool and Mr. Chew was noisy, but Mr. Chew had a
kind heart and lots of money. And Toni seemed to have a good time
with him and to like his dancing. It is doubtful if Iris ever
thought of having a good time; in her spun-glass quietness she
cared for nothing more vulgar than being admired. With Pete, as
with Cy Fickerty and Walter Rolf and Fletcher and Bruce Pasture,
she was always delicately amused, waiting, unmoving.</p>

<p>Whenever Pete invited Iris to a dance&mdash;that must have
been, on an average, nine times a week&mdash;she refused with
pallid sweetness, 'Oh, not to-night, I think, but it's so kind of
you'. Whereas Toni always accepted, and always accepted with a
whoop of 'Oh boy, ask me, <i>ask</i> me!' So, naturally, Pete
fell out of love with Toni and into love with Iris, as
devastatingly as he had fallen in love with Bethel, long, long
ago&mdash;days and days ago. He gaped at Iris during rehearsals;
he lolled at her delicate feet on the shoreward rocks; and when
she fluted such revelations as 'I think committing suicide on the
stage is quite dramatic, don't you?' Pete rumbled, 'It certainly
is&mdash;you bet your life&mdash;it certainly is!'</p>

<p>What the feline Iris would do with her plump boy-mouse, Bethel
did not know. Perhaps Iris herself did not know. Perhaps Iris
merely enjoyed waiting and stretching her claws and feeling the
quickness in them.</p>

<p><br>
Gravely tearing a lobster claw to pieces, at the Lobster Pot,
where the Nutmeg apprentices swarmed after the evening show to
drink beer and coffee and to play that monstrous form of charades
called 'The Game', Fletcher Hewitt studied Bethel, and said
slowly:</p>

<p>'Pete&mdash;Iris&mdash;Mahala&mdash;all those
amateurs&mdash;they spend too much time working up an artificial
sex stimulation. It takes up the energy they ought to give to
acting. I think you're free of it.'</p>

<p>'So are you,' said Bethel.</p>

<p>'Me? Huh! I have to be. I have my mother to
support&mdash;bless her. Beth! Are you falling for Andy
Deacon?'</p>

<p>'How ridiculous!'</p>

<p>'Why are you?'</p>

<p>'Oh, you know. He's so lovely and childish and beaming.'</p>

<p>'He's a nice fellow, Andy, for a rich young man, and he might
be a fair actor if he ever got any training. But you better duck
under shelter when he turns on that golden smile of his. All you
kids fall for it. But it's no use.'</p>

<p>'I know, Fletcher.'</p>

<p>'In fact some day, Beth, when you and I have been sufficiently
licked in this insane gamble of the theatre, we'll retire and get
married and go keep a summer hotel. <i>That'll</i> give us enough
people to fool with. Okay?'</p>

<p>'Yes, okay, Fletcher.'</p>

<p>She wasn't sure but that both of them half meant it.</p>

<p><br>
Between them, Bethel and Cynthia Aleshire made much of the
Bernice Niemeyer costumes, and Bethel was so excited by them that
she forgot her meals... well, she forgot one meal. Bernice was
to flaunt sleazy satin frocks and to paint her face like a
gasoline pump.</p>

<p>When, at the dress rehearsal on Sunday evening, Bethel stood
up from the desk to reveal herself in an apricot-coloured tea
gown, with purple panels, slightly torn, with a chain of carved
imitation-ivory beads, a chain of crimson glass beads, a chain of
coins, a souvenir bracelet hung with small silver animals, and a
broad chased bracelet of plated silver, with her lips widened and
(under Cynthia's tutorship) her temples and cheeks hollowed, she
received a tiny hand of applause from the Grampion theatre
sponsors, and she heard Roscoe whimper to Cynthia, 'Why, she
looks the part pretty well'.</p>

<p>Ah, that was heavenly praise! Ah, that was praise enough for
Bernhardt! Dear youth!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<p class="first">BETHEL was shy enough; in any mob of more than
five people she was so uneasy that she chattered, and hated
herself for chattering. Yet exposed before the four hundred and
seventeen people at the first night of <i>Stage
Door&mdash;</i>and that was a large audience for the Nutmeg
Theatre&mdash;she was, after the agony and trembling of waiting
for the curtain to go up, as placid as a bishop. For she was not
Bethel Merriday at all; she was Bernice Niemeyer; and very
intrusive.</p>

<p>In her dressing-room, between scenes, she felt sure of
herself. It was a real dressing-room to which she had now
climbed. Though it was a large, jammed, low-ceiled den, which she
shared with three other apprentices, and with Iris, Clara Ribbons
and Maggie Sample, it had real dressing-room shelf-tables, narrow
enough so that she could study her make-up in a mirror
enchantingly rimmed with lights.</p>

<p>At the final curtain line-up, she got a reasonable share of
the hands, and knew that if she had not been brilliant, she had
not been bad. Fletcher Hewitt cried, afterward, 'You were
magnificent, baby'; Andy Deacon beamed, 'Nice work, Miss M-
Merriday'; Roscoe Valentine so far extended himself as to croak,
'You were all right, I guess'; Iris Pentire, as they undressed
(no elaborate task in the days of three-piece robing) caroled,
'Just be careful and don't jump cues, dear'; and Mr. Black Bart
wrote, in the New London <i>Era:</i></p>

<br>

<p class="quote">As it is probable that off-stage she is a very
charming sloe-eyed young woman, a new friend, Miss Bethel
Merriday, is all the more to be praised for having made Bernice
so objectionable and flashy that she made you itch, and yet so
pathetic when she busted down that you changed your mind and
decided to just shoot her instead of boiling her in hair oil.</p>

<br>

<p>That review is on page seven of Beth's scrapbook, just after
her dance programmes, the programme of a Universalist Church
cantata in which she sang two lines, the stub of her ticket to
her first basketball game at Point Royal College, and the
programme of <i>A Doll's House.</i> And just before it appears
the first opening-night telegram that she ever received; it came
from Charley Hatch, Alva Prindle and Ben Merriday, and read 'All
wish you thousand good wishes to-night good luck wish were
there'. That had made her homesick, on first night, for at least
two minutes.</p>

<p><br>
Through the week, all the evenings after the strained first
night, it was pleasant to slip out of doors between acts for one
of her few cigarettes.</p>

<p>You could do that, in a summer theatre, under the
trees&mdash;though also you had to endure the inquisitive
spectators, city brokers feeling superior on
vacation&mdash;millionaires for sixteen days a year&mdash;who
sneaked around back of the theatre to stare at the actors as at a
zoo. Some of them even had the bad manners to ask for autographs
between acts, but this did not annoy Bethel&mdash;she was not yet
notorious enough to be dunned, or to hate the whole tribe of
autograph hunters, the thick-skinned devotees of the one hobby in
the world which consists in turning into brazen beggars and
annoying innocent strangers, preferably by interrupting their
talk with friends just at the moment when they are most weary and
relaxed. To Bethel the theatre-goers were still heavenly visitors
who, out of pure benevolence, were permitting her to act.</p>

<p>Through the week while she was playing <i>Stage Door,</i>
Bethel was rehearsing all day long for her second role, that of
the maid in <i>George and Margaret.</i> Iris should have had this
lively bit, but Iris was to take part in a broadcast in New York
on an evening this next week&mdash;a fact which made Bethel, who
had come to consider Iris as a pink papier m&acirc;ch&eacute;
sphinx, to hold her again in awe. Was Iris not one of the
magicians who could make twenty million modern Americans listen
to such bodiless beauty, such skylark melody as the shoplifter in
a radio drama lilting to her mate, 'Grab your rod and
scram&mdash;it's de G-men'?</p>

<p>Now, first, Bethel knew something of the labour of the real
theatre&mdash;a toil which was already persuading Anita Hill and
Harry Mihick to talk of Roscoe Valentine as a slave driver and of
doing the stage an irreparable injury by renouncing it. She was
working violently, sixteen hours out of the twenty-four. All day
she rehearsed in <i>George and Margaret,</i> in the brown,
stuffy, spicy heat of the theatre, which she loved above the sea
foam and sea gulls and silver-channelled sea outside. All
evening, and at Wednesday matin&eacute;e, she played <i>Stage
Door.</i> Till two o'clock she sat up studying her new lines and
helping make her costume as maid. She was afraid of mixing up the
two plays, so that as the bounding Bernice from the
Bronx&mdash;standing out there, helpless, fanning the air for her
line&mdash;she would be able to say nothing to her fellow-job-
hunters beyond 'Very good, moddom'.</p>

<p>She was always a little dazed, always surprised to find that
she had, without having for a second heard her own voice, got
clear through an evening of <i>Stage Door</i> without making a
fool of herself. Roscoe was wearing down, and beginning to shriek
all through rehearsals, but Bethel was too numb now to resent
it.</p>

<p>Then, on Saturday morning, the spell was broken, and Roscoe
became her enemy.</p>

<p><br>
Roscoe had become edgier every day through the week, and last
night he had fully attended a Chianti party among the artists at
Old Lyme.</p>

<p>Gladys the maid, who was Bethel, was supposed to enter in the
third act of <i>George and Margaret</i> with a smartness
befitting her new God-given station as the fianc&eacute;e of the
oldest son of the family. It was morning, and Bethel had slept,
and she knew her lines, and at rehearsal she was one with the
gods as she blithely tripped in, chirping 'I'm going now, Mrs.
Garth-Bander'.</p>

<p>'Oh God, Bethel, don't you know anything about your part?'
yelled Roscoe. 'This wench is supposed to be scared to death of
the old hag. Try to act, even if God did make it impossible. Take
that entrance again.'</p>

<p>Bethel looked at him silently, unhappily. She thought that
Andy Deacon, perched on the back of a seat far back in the
auditorium, seemed annoyed and smoked rapidly.</p>

<p>Again she came on, through an imaginary door between two
chairs. She smiled wanly at Clara Ribbons, who was yawning as she
tried to wake up enough to impersonate Mrs. Garth-Bander, and she
said 'I'm going now' timidly.</p>

<p>Roscoe yelled again, and hysterically: 'I didn't tell you to
play it like a funeral, you fool! Get some life into it, d'you
hear me, <i>d'you hear me,</i> D'YOU HEAR ME?'</p>

<p>In the quiet after this shrieking, Andy came down the centre
aisle, blank as a sleepwalker, and spoke to Roscoe, flatly,
'Don't talk that way. I do not like it. I do not like your
screaming. Do not talk that way, Mr. Valentine!'</p>

<p>And clumped back to his seat.</p>

<p>Bethel had never before really seen anyone turn purple. Roscoe
turned purple. He glanced for a second at Andy's broad back, he
glanced at Fletcher and Doc Keezer and Clara, who had made their
faces expressionless, he glanced at the trembling Bethel, with
poison pouring out of his red eyes and loose mouth. He pushed
forward his neck like a turtle. He spoke calmly enough.</p>

<p>'I am sorry, Miss Merriday, if I have been too enthusiastic in
my directing, as Mr. Deacon seems to think. We will go on now.
Try your entrance again. You come in gaily, but your courage
begins to ooze when you see the old woman. All right.'</p>

<p>He never called her 'Bethel' again.</p>

<p>She appeared in one more play, in the tiny part of Eva Blake
in Noel Coward's <i>We Were Dancing,</i> and in that Roscoe
directed her with just as much interest as if he were winding a
watch.</p>

<p>When they had sifted out for lunch, after this fatal
rehearsal, Andy patted her back, grinned, said casually, 'I'm
afraid I just made you the more uncomfortable by blowing up and
bawling out poor old Roscoe. He'll forget it by to-night. You're
doing swell work&mdash;uh&mdash;Bethel.'</p>

<p>This voice from Eden did not console her. She took Fletcher
aside after lunch:</p>

<p>'What will I do? I've made an enemy of Mr. Valentine, and I
didn't mean too. Honestly, it isn't because I'm scared about his
keeping me from getting jobs and so on, but it makes me feel sick
to think of him looking at me that way... as if I were a
bedbug.'</p>

<p>Fletcher was cheerful. 'Beth, I'd be unhappy about your future
if I didn't think the spiteful people are going to dislike you.
That's one test of success. And&mdash;I'm afraid I know better
now why girls adore Andy. He didn't jump on Roscoe just because
he can afford to. He would have jumped just the same if he'd been
a walk-on with holes in his soles. While I sat back and didn't
say anything. Sorry.'</p>

<p>Fletcher turned away quickly.</p>

<p><br>
The Nutmeg Players were going to hold their first party this
Saturday evening, the end of the run of <i>Stage Door,</i> and
Bethel felt high.</p>

<p>Rain was threatening, and they would have the party in the
dormitory instead of on the beach. In the dining-room Japanese
lanterns were so blossoming by supper-time that the place looked
more like a Baptist lawn festival in Sladesbury than like a
temple of Chekhov.</p>

<p>As Bethel crossed to the theatre, before evening performance,
she was excited by the omens of the storm. It was unnaturally
dark, and incessant distant lightning revealed whitecaps and
shaken sailboats out on the Sound and turned the sedge grass to a
poison green, while the whole shifting air was filled with
uneasiness and the brave last fireflies were menacing points of
flame.</p>

<p>The audience was small, and it breathed hard at the occasional
thunder, yet it was a good audience, quick to laugh, quick to be
stilled in sympathy. Already Bethel had learned to be conscious
of audiences; not to fawn to them, but to feel them. To-night she
was playing well enough&mdash;or it may have been badly
enough&mdash;so that she didn't care whether anybody else thought
she was playing well or ill.</p>

<p>She was annoyed, from the wings, at Iris's mourning and
handclasping as the suicidal Kaye; she felt somehow responsible
for her room-mate. But at the end, when the audience stopped even
in reaching for raincoats and rubbers to applaud and scream
'Bravo' as the cast assembled for curtain call, Bethel felt ten
feet tall, in golden armour, and ran into the communal dressing-
room emitting happiness like a cloud of steam.</p>

<p>If Roscoe pettishly stayed away from them, Andy looked in to
shout, 'You were all on your toes to-night, kids. You're all
Margaret Sullavans, the whole lot of you.'</p>

<p>They were all stripped to dressing-gowns, rubbing cold-creamed
faces with wads of tissue, when an unknown voice, like that of a
young Scotti, rumbled at the door, 'May I come in?'</p>

<p>The owner of the voice ploughed in without waiting.</p>

<p>He was a belligerent-looking, square young man, with tousled
brown hair and a face, healthy and slightly rough of skin, that
turned instantly from impish impertinence to sorrow and back
again. He might have been a butcher, a Communist poet, a
fundamentalist evangelist, a prize fighter or a researcher in
physics. His bare head, his thick brown sweater, his khaki
trousers dripped rain.</p>

<p>'Hello, girls,' he said. He stopped beside Toni Titmus (she
had played the Hollywood hussy) and grunted, 'You weren't too
bad&mdash;you had some hint of oomph, sister.'</p>

<p>'Whadya mean "sister". I never saw you before,' bristled
Toni.</p>

<p>'You will. Plenty. On Broadway. With Maurice Evans <i>and</i>
the Theatre Group, some day. I'm Zed Wintergeist, of the Dory
Playhouse&mdash;Jerry O'Toole's select summer sisterhood down the
coast. Not playing this week. Took the night off to give your
masterpiece the once-over... God, most of you were bad! I
should come out in the rain to see <i>you,</i> sweetie!'</p>

<p>Young Mr. Zed Wintergeist had plodded over to Iris Pentire now
and was looking down at her, amused, apparently not overcome by
the sight of her delicate shoulders. 'It didn't look as though it
was economic inequality that made <i>you</i> bump yourself off in
the play, but just plain bellyache.'</p>

<p><i>'Really!'</i> said Iris.</p>

<p>He proceeded to Bethel, dripping all the way. His glance, bold
but good-humoured, impertinent yet honest, made her too uncertain
for any Sladesburian retorts of outraged ladyhood.</p>

<p>'You were pretty fair, Bethel&mdash;I take it from the
programme that that's your pious name. Lemme look at your
eyes.'</p>

<p>'Really!' said Iris again: and Toni, 'Of all the nerve!' But
in silence Bethel let the young bully jab his forefinger under
her chin, tilt her back head and stare at her eyes. 'Yeah. I
guess so. You got some perception. You got into Bernice's
hide&mdash;made me understand how much that poor gutter pup
longed for a chance to parade, and yet you didn't do much tear-
jerking&mdash;you made her as intrusive and offensive&mdash;'</p>

<p>'As you are!' yelped Marian Croy.</p>

<p>'Exactly. That's what I was going to say!'</p>

<p>'I suppose you're casting us all for the play you're going to
produce in 1968,' cried Iris. (It was the first time that Bethel
had ever seen Iris yanked out of her frail aloofness, and for
that she could have loved Zed Wintergeist.)</p>

<p>'Yes, sweetie, and maybe I am, at that. Be good, girls. See
you all at the party. Don't let Mahala Vale put anything over on
you. I saw her once, in an awful piece of tripe about share
croppers. She was lousy. She peeled potatoes with kid gloves on.
Andy Deacon doesn't know it yet, but he's going to invite me to
your party. See you there, Bethel! Be good.'</p>

<p>They all begged her not to take the monster's attentions
seriously.</p>

<p>She told them that she didn't intend to take them at
all&mdash;only Zed wasn't really a monster&mdash;not
really&mdash;just a 'fresh kid'&mdash;couldn't be over twenty-
two&mdash;just a baby&mdash;</p>

<p>'In sin and impertinence, he's ninety-two,' groaned Marian
Croy. 'His heart is black with vice. He thinks he can act! I know
he was the prize scholar in a progressive school, and got the
works of John Dewey bound in ooze calf for graduation.'</p>

<p>'That's just what I was going to say!' said Toni.</p>

<p>'Yes! So was I!' said Iris.</p>

<p>'Were you, darlings?' said Marian.</p>

<p><br>
As all of the apprentices had appeared in <i>Stage Door,</i>
Roscoe made only four of the more docile among them miss the
party and work all of Saturday night changing the sets. He even
hired two men to work with them; Doc Keezer alleged that this
must have cost Roscoe all of ten dollars, almost the only money
that he had been ever known to pay in wages without
compulsion.</p>

<p>Before the <i>Stage Door</i> set came down, Bethel went on to
stare at it with more nostalgic love than she had ever given her
wide-porched home in Sladesbury.</p>

<p>On a stage twenty-one feet wide between the proscenic pillars,
Cynthia had magicked a forty-foot apartment. That was Bethel's
real home, that canvas-walled, canvas-ceilinged, littered den,
with its fourth wall made of air: the handsome stairway out in
the hall, the fireplace with white wooden columns like a small-
sized edition of a national bank, the huddle of couch and piano,
the handsome double doors that led to a festive dining-room, off-
stage left, where she had eaten so many meals with her companions
of the Footlights Club.</p>

<p>She murmured to Doc Keezer&mdash;now changed from a frail
country doctor back to a short, grizzled, somehow unidentifiable
trouper. 'Oh, Doc, won't you miss this set? Don't you think it's
terrible it has to come down after only one week?'</p>

<p>Doc Keezer looked startled. He said mildly, 'Set? Don't know's
I noticed it much. Any set's all right, if you can get on it
without stooping through the doors and barking your shins, but
otherwise, they all seem alike, after thirty-five years of
it&mdash;I started at fifteen&mdash;my father and mother were in
burlyque. No, dear, I don't think I'll miss it!'</p>

<p><br>
She heard the bumptious invader, Zed Wintergeist, just off-
stage, greeting Andy Deacon.</p>

<p>'H're you, Andy? Remember me?'</p>

<p>'Why&mdash;oh, of course! Zed! See the show to-night?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Ran up from the Dory. I'm doing time there this
summer.'</p>

<p>'How did you like us?'</p>

<p>'Oh&mdash;well&mdash;you know. Can't expect much from
stock.'</p>

<p>'I see.'</p>

<p>'Look, Andy, what you going to do this fall? If I had your
money&mdash;and your patience&mdash;yes, and talent,
too&mdash;I'd produce something experimental.'</p>

<p>'Maybe I will, Zed. Look me up in the fall&mdash;if you're
interested.' But Andy did not sound too cordial.</p>

<p>'You bet your life I'm interested! I'll look you up. Say, uh,
understand your gang is having a spirited little gathering this
evening.'</p>

<p>'Yes. In the dorm. Come along, will you? And can I put you up
to-night? Rain's pretty bad.'</p>

<p>'Yes to both. See you later.'</p>

<p><br>
She stood with Andy at the stage door, awaiting a halt in the
rain before they should scurry over to the dormitory.</p>

<p>'I heard you talking to that Wintergeist boy, Andy. Is he a
good actor?'</p>

<p>'Excellent. I'm not sure but that Zed'll turn out to be
another Burgess Meredith or Van Heflin or Dean Jagger.'</p>

<p>'He seems so bumptious.'</p>

<p>'Young people of talent often are. I haven't had the chance to
get much acquainted with you yet, my dear&mdash;not my fault, I
assure you!&mdash;but I haven't a doubt that you're just as
cocksure of yourself&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, I am not!'</p>

<p>'&mdash;only you have more ladylike manners. You wouldn't want
Zed to be ladylike, would you?'</p>

<p>'Who <i>is</i> he?'</p>

<p>'Nobody&mdash;yet. He's conceited and destructive. He'd be
perfectly capable of telling Guthrie McClintic or Tony Miner that
their direction is rotten. But he's honest, and he's got ideas,
and he doesn't want to be an elegant connoisseur&mdash;like
me!'</p>

<p>'Oh, you're not!'</p>

<p>'I played with him on tour in that English mystery melodrama,
<i>The Light Goes Out.</i> He was the English captain who'd
murdered the Rector of Mittyford, and he made even that phony
part believable. You could almost smell the mess port and the
machine-gun grease. And I, my dear Beth, will have you understand
that I was a chief inspector of Scotland Yard&mdash;<i>chief</i>
inspector, not a plain one!&mdash;and I was so realistic that in
Pittsburgh, Harold Cohen wrote that I made him homesick for the
Camden, New Jersey, police station... Yes. I'm a better
organizer than Zed; I'm more punctual and I can keep expense
accounts more accurately; but I'll never be able to act as well,'
said the honest Andy.</p>

<p>'You just mean you'll never be able to act as noisily.'</p>

<p>The great man was looking grateful.</p>

<p>'Thank you, my public! Zed's a biological and biographical
sport. I'm afraid I'm too standardized. He's one half Virginia
gentry, and a quarter German and a quarter Irish, I suppose with
some good Jewish blood for flavour. I suspect his real Christian
name of being Ezekiel. He's about twenty-three, I guess. He came
from a Montana ranch to Broadway via a country newspaper in
Minnesota and a medicine show and a year in Dartmouth College and
a few months in the New York School for Design and six months
playing Shakespeare in the Old Vic in London. God knows how he
got into any of 'em, but it's easy to see how he got out of all
of 'em. Well, Iris, darling&mdash;oh, I'm sorry! Bethel darling,
I mean!&mdash;let's forgive him. Look! Rain's let up. Let's
scoot.'</p>

<p><br>
Somebody&mdash;Bethel suspected Andy&mdash;had for the party
provided cold chicken, lobster salad, English sweet biscuits and
champagne&mdash;oh, a very little champagne, of a very little
domestic brand, but it was the first Bethel had ever tasted, and
on tasting it she decided that it wasn't half as good as cider.
Nothing so obvious as alcohol or nicotine would be the downfall
of Bethel Merriday.</p>

<p>At the party they played The Game, inevitably, and Maggie
Sample astounded them by coming to life and riotously enacting
the advertising slogan, 'A skin you love to touch'.</p>

<p>Zed Wintergeist went around being superior to these
puerilities. In a corner he muttered again to Bethel that she
really hadn't been bad&mdash;that she might have a chance to
become a real actress, if she worked like a slave.</p>

<p>It was the warmest attention she had ever had from a fellow
priestling. 'They say my danger is overplaying,' she
confided.</p>

<p>'Nonsense! Bunch of amateurs! Overacting <i>did</i> used to be
the tradition. Then the Provincetown Players and the Theatre
Guild came along and made acting more natural. Now we're going
too far, underplaying too much. Can't you see from the words
themselves that <i>under</i>playing must be just as bad as
<i>over</i>playing. I'd rather be a scenery chewer than play so
far down that it ain't playing at all. <i>Playing,</i> that's
what you'll do!'</p>

<p>Maybe she was being taken seriously! breathed the ecstatic
Bethel.</p>

<p>Andy and Mahala were burlesquing their last scene in <i>Stage
Door.</i></p>

<p><br>
ANDY: By the way, you <i>are</i> my girl, aren't you, Maggie?
You know I'm co-director of the Nutmeg Players.</p>

<p>MAHALA: Okay. Here's where I kiss you&mdash;only I
don't&mdash;it's after eleven-thirty and it'd cost you time and a
half overtime, Equity ruling.</p>

<p>ANDY: Roscoe would never stand for that, so we'll just pay a
spiritual tribute to your great future on the stage.</p>

<p>MAHALA: No, 'tis something else I want, too&mdash;a room of my
own.</p>

<p>ANDY: And that's your curtain line? What kind of an ending is
that for a romantic play!</p>

<p><br>
Everybody laughed very much&mdash;except Bethel and Marian,
who felt embarrassed, and Roscoe, who glared at the reference to
his parsimony, and Zed, who snarled to Bethel, 'That's the worst
piece of irreligiousness I ever heard! To burlesque a part you've
just been playing, no matter what part, is my idea of a damn
blasphemous sacrilege!'</p>

<p>'Oh, dry up, angel,' said that seasoned woman of the world,
Miss Merriday.</p>

<p>He looked offended and stalked away, and she was certain that
he had none of Andy's warm humour. A quarter of an hour later she
beheld Zed squatted on the floor by Iris's chair and gazing at
her rapturously, while Iris dripped down upon him all her frail
sweetness.</p>

<p>'And to think that young man dared to criticize Andy! Mr.
Jerry O'Toole and the Dory Playhouse can keep him!' snorted
Bethel.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<p class="first">THAT Thursday afternoon, the fourth of the
<i>George and Margaret</i> run, Bethel had a letter from her
father:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"> <span class="smcap">Dear Daughter</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">It is fairly cool for July up here, I always
say the sea may be all right but you cant beat the hills for real
nice summer weather, we took out the car last evening &amp; had a
nice joy ride to Norfolk to see Cousin Mary, you wont remember
her she is the daughter of old Squire Patten, still has her teeth
@ eighty and eyesight as good as a girl's. Well, you have only 5
weeks after this week in summer theatre &amp; am sure you realize
none better that you must now give some solid thought to question
of what you will do in the fall.<br> <br> We have an idea you
will be wanting to fly off to N Y and look for a job in the
theatre but we have been talking a lot to Mr. Sampson you
remember him, though now in mercantile business he had a lot of
experience with the stage, vaudeville &amp; Shakespeare &amp; so
forth when a boy, he says N Y is a terribly dangerous place for a
young girl, gets more so every year with all these immoral shows
&amp; dance hall and so on.</p>

<p class="letter">Now Bethel we want you to do whatever you think
is right, we have every confidence in yr good sense &amp; if you
absolutely feel you must go on the stage, shall stand back of you
always. We have decided we can manage to let you have $25.00 a
week till you get a job, though as you probably know business is
bad &amp; collections simply terrible I swear they are almost as
bad as in 1930.<br> <br> But we beg of you to stop &amp; think if
you are not still pretty young to try &amp; cope with the
temptations in N Y &amp; if we couldn't persuade you to stay home
for a year &amp; then tackle the city. We are not getting any
younger though thank God we are both still hale &amp; hearty but
we are both at a time of life when we can never tell how much
longer we will have a chance to see our daughter &amp; visit with
her &amp; of course Ben has a girl friend, several of them I
guess, &amp; we don't hardly ever see him except at breakfast,
&amp; while we certainly do not complain &amp; enjoy the radio
&amp; occasional movie as much as anybody, it sometimes gets
lonely here &amp; it certainly would brighten up this household a
terrible lot if we could hear our bright girl chatting &amp;
entertaining her friends here in the evening, maybe our last
chance to see anything of her, but dear, you must decide, we
honestly don't want to put any pressure on you. The dog was sick
last week, too much whoopee, I guess. Well, I must close now
&amp; hope you are enjoying every second of your stay with all
those clever people.</p>

<p class="letter">With all our love,</p>

<p class="letter">Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="letter">Your loving,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Father and
Mother</span>.</p>

<br>

<p>She cried.</p>

<p>She saw them, alone in the evenings, waiting, talking about
her; she saw their eyes, so cautious yet so kind; timid dull eyes
that she could so easily brighten with her chatter. Surely the
least she could do for them was to give them a year of her
life&mdash;</p>

<p>But she had to hasten to the theatre.</p>

<p><br>
After the play, Fletcher stuck his head in to drawl, 'Gent to
see you, Beth. Looks to me like the boy friend from back home.
Charley Hatch.'</p>

<p>'Oh, dear!' wailed Bethel. 'Tell him to wait!'</p>

<p>Already it seemed to her natural that Fletcher, Andy, Roscoe
should see her in loose dressing-gown and bare feet. They
belonged to the sacred order of wandering vagabonds. But Charley
was an outsider&mdash;how dismayingly an outsider she perceived
now.</p>

<p>She flung on a skirt and sweater and sandals and scrabbled her
hair into some sort of a knot and crept out. Before she could
face him with the gaiety and poise suitable to an actress, she
had to halt inside the dressing-room door, her throat throbbing.
She was not insincere; nothing so masterful as that. She was
plain frightened by the kind demand that she return to babyhood
and the back streets and the evenings of loving vacuity.</p>

<p>'Why, Charley! This is too divine! Did you drive down to see
the show?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I guess so. Well, no, I drove down to see you, mostly, I
guess.'</p>

<p>'But you were out front?'</p>

<p>'Uh?'</p>

<p>'I mean, you saw our play?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes&mdash;yes, sure.'</p>

<p>'Why didn't you let me know and I'd've had a ticket for
you.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;Kind of thought I'd better buy my own. And I
wanted to surprise you.'</p>

<p>'And you certainly did! In such a lovely way, I mean.'</p>

<p>'Let's go somewhere and talk.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, Charley&mdash;oh yes, of course. Uh&mdash;have you
got your car with you?'</p>

<p>'Sure.'</p>

<p>'Then we might drive to the Lobster Pot. It's a ducky
place.'</p>

<p>'Is it?' Nothing more from Charley, as he escorted her to the
car. She felt as frothy as Mahala Vale. She became very
geographical about the neighbouring estates as they drove into
Grampion Centre.</p>

<p>At table in the Lobster Pot, Charley, very virile and
dominating, demanded, 'Want a drink, Bet?'</p>

<p>'No, I don't believe so.'</p>

<p>'You can have one if you want to. I'm getting wise to the
world. You got to, if you're a streamlined salesman. You don't
have to conceal any vices from me.'</p>

<p>'I haven't got any to conceal.'</p>

<p>'No? Well, that's all the better.'</p>

<p>'They have lovely waffles and chicken here.'</p>

<p>'Kind of late at night for waffles, isn't it? Well, all right.
You can only be young once!'</p>

<p>'Charley! Here's a funny coincidence. I heard from Mama and
Papa this afternoon. Did you know anything about it?'</p>

<p>'Why yes, in a way. I kind of got to talking with them,
yesterday. Listen: I don't know's you ought to go off and leave
'em all alone. You certainly owe them some gratitude for having
brought you into the world, and giving you such a swell
education.'</p>

<p>'I know. They've been wonderful.' She spoke wretchedly, in a
vision of returning home and, evening after evening, listening to
her father chuckling, 'Almost time to hear Amos and Andy on the
radio. Don't know how they ever think up all those comical
things'. But&mdash;yes, she must do it; she couldn't be
selfish.</p>

<p>After all, what was a mere year?</p>

<p>'You oughtn't to be so selfish and sacrifice them.'</p>

<p>'I know.'</p>

<p>'And they've been so patient with your notions about
acting&mdash;even let you come here to this crazy place.'</p>

<p>'What? What do you mean? "Crazy"?'</p>

<p>'Why sure. Isn't it? Lot of grown-up people kicking around on
the stage and kissing and Lord knows what-all instead of working
for a living.'</p>

<p>'So you don't call acting working?'</p>

<p>'Do you?'</p>

<p>'You don't think it's important like your work&mdash;like
selling coffee percolators!'</p>

<p>'I certainly do not! That's what you could call a real
Mission, and not kid yourself either&mdash;thousands of
households getting better coffee&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And quicker!'</p>

<p>'&mdash;yes, and quicker, every morning! And you got no idea
what sales resistance there is, these days. It takes guts and
scientific training to make folks change their brand of
percolator. It's a real man-sized job&mdash;not like painting
your face and putting on a lot of fancy clothes and pee-rading
around in front of a lot of women.'</p>

<p>'I see your idea.'</p>

<p>'Yes, and you'll adopt it, too, when you grow up and realize
your responsibilities. Now, Bet, I'm no poet or no actor, but I
guess you know I've always stuck to you like a limpet.'</p>

<p>'What's a limpet?'</p>

<p>'Huh? Oh, you know. It's just a kind of expression. And as I
say, you're never going to find any of these pretty boys that'll
be devoted to you, and forgive all your wild ideas, the way I do.
I watched 'em to-night! Bunch of acrobats!'</p>

<p>'Charley Hatch! You look at those two men at that table! Andy
Deacon, the big fellow, and Fletcher Hewitt&mdash;the
Yankee&mdash;he's our stage manager. Either one of 'em could lick
his weight in Joe Louises. Either one of 'em could build a set
out of cardboard, and tour it carrying the set on his shoulders,
and play with a fever in his bones. I suppose they're pretty
boys! I suppose they're acrobats!'</p>

<p>'I didn't mean to get you sore. I just mean&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And what did you just-mean, may I ask!'</p>

<p>'Ah, don't get sore! I just mean things are going fine with
me. I'll be making fifty, in less than two years, if you could
wait. We could get a dandy little three-room flat, looking right
out on the high-school grounds. And a convertible coop with a top
that it goes up automatically when you push a button. You've seen
'em? They're dandy.' Wistfully: 'We could have an awfully nice
time, driving around to Waterbury and Hartford and every place,
on Sunday, and take a picnic lunch along&mdash;I'd get a thermos
jug. We'd laugh a lot together. I don't laugh so much, now you're
gone, Bet.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm sorry, but&mdash;Oh no, no, no!'</p>

<p>'Not good enough for you, eh? I hear that Deacon fellow has
all kinds of dough. I suppose a fellow has to have a Park Avenue
apartment and a chauffeur to interest you in him!'</p>

<p>'You see here! I expect to have a hall bedroom, myself, in New
York&mdash;'</p>

<p>'So you <i>are</i> going there!'</p>

<p>'I certainly am... now! I expect to walk my feet off
looking for a job at minimum. I expect to model or wait on table
while I'm waiting for it. I'm going to act. You've made me see
that, no matter if it makes me feel wicked and ungrateful and
selfish, no matter even if I fail, I'm going to act. I know
now!'</p>

<p>'Well, it's kind of too bad. You and I might've had a good
time. Of course you aren't pretty, like Annie
McLaut&mdash;remember her?'</p>

<p>'In school? Lots of teeth?'</p>

<p>'She's got the finest set of teeth in Sladesbury, let me tell
you that! And she doesn't want to go helling around New York and
Hollywood. She'd be glad to stay home and keep house. She thinks
it's important to increase a sales quota. I think I'll see a lot
of her. I don't guess you'll be sore, will you?'</p>

<p>'I certainly won't!'</p>

<p>'Then I guess she and I'll be married in the fall.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that's splendid; that's perfectly splendid.'</p>

<p>She tried to make it enthusiastic, but she had dropped ten
thousand feet and landed on rock. She had discovered that she was
much worse than wicked; she was dispensable. As Charley babbled
about the wonders of Miss McLaut, apparently rather relieved at
his freedom to enter a new slavery, Bethel was a very little girl
whose family had forgotten to call her for Christmas dinner. It
was all of five minutes before she could get up a self-respecting
bad temper again.</p>

<p><br>
'You say this Andrew Deacon is quite a husky guy,' said
Charley.</p>

<p>'Oh yes. He got his football letter at Yale, and he was Skull
and Bones, too, and Phi Beta Kappa.'</p>

<p>'And rich? Don't some guys have all the luck! I don't think
he's good-looking like these fellows in the moom [<i>sic</i>]
pictures, though.'</p>

<p>'Oh course not, thank heaven!'</p>

<p>'He ever make a pass at you?'</p>

<p>'Don't be absurd! Mr. Deacon doesn't know I exist, except as
the dark-eyed kid among the apprentices. He isn't sure whether my
name is Bethel or Elizabeth&mdash;or Mehitabel.</p>

<p>'But your name isn't anything like Mehitabel.'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;no&mdash;is isn't.'</p>

<p>'Well, I guess it's all to the good he don't care for
you.'</p>

<p>'But he does!'</p>

<p>'But I thought you said&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, never <i>mind</i> what I said!'</p>

<p>'Gosh, Bet, this play-acting life is certainly getting you
hysterical. Well, never mind. I hear this Deacon fellow's mother
lives in a regular high-toned castle, in Newport. He's out of our
class entirely.'</p>

<p>'Ours? Charley, I never realized it: you're perfectly content
to go on living on a side street in a side-street town!'</p>

<p>'Aren't you?'</p>

<p>'I've never thought much about it. But I guess there's no
position in the world that I won't demand&mdash;if I can earn
it.'</p>

<p>'You're going to let yourself in for a lot of trouble.'</p>

<p>'I hope so!' She was exuberant. 'Yes. I hope so.'</p>

<p>Andy and Fletcher Hewitt were leaving; Fletcher stopped by
their table and spoke to Charley:</p>

<p>'I envy you for being an old friend of Bethel. We're very
proud of her. I don't believe she knows it herself&mdash;she'll
probably scratch me for calling her a good Puritanical
influence&mdash;but I assure you, Mr. Hatch, she's the kind that
keeps us all working harder and drinking less and going to bed
earlier.'</p>

<p>Charley&mdash;her Charley, who so recently had been nothing
but the scrubby little boy next door&mdash;answered
condescendingly: 'Glad to hear that. Guess it's pretty hard to go
straight and take care of your health when you associate with a
lot of crazy actors that stay up all night.'</p>

<p>'You make me sick!' said Bethel.</p>

<p>But Fletcher answered Charley with gravity: 'Yes, it is. The
stage is a good dream, but I long for a little reality sometimes.
Good night.'</p>

<p>'Any time you're in Sladesbury, just drop in and see
me&mdash;the Flamolio sales offices,' said Charley.</p>

<p>'Oh, thank you, that's very kind of you,' said Fletcher.</p>

<p>And what made Bethel glad to see the last of Charley, to feel
free when he had gone, was his patronizing summary afterward:</p>

<p>'Well now, that's not such a bad guy, that Mr. Fletcher. I
wouldn't hardly think he was connected with the stage. He looks
like a regular guy.'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;yes dear&mdash;I think he might be a regular guy.
Will you forgive me, Charley? I'm so sleepy.'</p>

<p>Only she felt that it was her youth, and everything she had
loved and trusted, that was driving away that night with Charley
Hatch.</p>

<p>Iris had not come in yet, at one in the morning&mdash;as Iris
was likely not to come in, these days, now that the auriferous
Pete Chew was fascinated by her. Bethel sat brooding:</p>

<p>'I would go home and stay&mdash;oh, not a year, but for months
and months. But they wouldn't like it. They wouldn't like it any
better than Charley did, when they find out how restless I really
am.</p>

<p>'So I'm "out of Andy's class!" Not good enough for him. I'm
slightly crazy about you, Mr. Deacon. I like your funny, bristly
hair. I like your solid jaw. I would very much like to pat
it&mdash;except that you would probably sock me. I think your
voice is like a whole flock of organs all playing Bach suites. I
like your childish grin. But a Merriday of Merriday Grange is as
good as any powder-making Deacon and any Mrs. J. Goddard Deacon
and your Aunt Victoria Cabot Lodge Sedgwick Lowell Brewster
Deacon, if there is one. I come from a very fine family, Mr.
Deacon, and my mother's brother is the best accordion player in
the state of New Hampshire.</p>

<p>'Anyway, I'm not one of these brats that want to go on the
stage just to escape from a beastly home, as Toni does, as Pete
Chew does... as maybe Andy does. Dear Andy.</p>

<p>'Dear Andy... I <i>am</i> so sleepy!... When I come in
crying, as Gladys the maid&mdash;if I just stopped and stood with
my mouth open, like an angry cat, not making any... I'll try
that to-morrow evening. That ought to go over big.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<p class="first">FIVE more weeks of summer theatre, and of school
for Bethel: voice projection; building up a laugh; answering cues
with not a tenth-of-a-second wait. In the last week, Miss Sample
unwillingly hurled at her a laurel wreath: 'Well, you may have a
chance. You better try New York once, before you give up. You
never can tell. I read the other day that the Shuberts are giving
tests to an Eskimo.'</p>

<p>And in odd hours she was sent back again to building scenery.
Now that she had had to act before it, scenery was no longer a
stupid mass of mechanism but a living part of the action.</p>

<p>Toni, Iris, Doc Keezer could not see why an actor should know
anything about scenery. Even Walter Rolf grumbled, 'No more need
of it than there is of an author's learning printing and
binding'. But Bethel saw that the scene designer could ruin the
actor&mdash;swamp him in flamboyant form and colours, or make a
whole scene dreary by too drab a background&mdash;or help him by
making it clear, as the curtain went up, just what sort of person
he was, how rich or poor, how precise or slatternly.</p>

<p>And the actor could use the scenery; he could really look out
of that window and see the Kentish downs there&mdash;though if he
was not actor, he would behold, through the paneless windows,
nothing but Toni Titmus, in dirty linen overalls, sitting on a
kitchen chair in front of a melancholy pile of furniture all on
end, humped up over the play script, and passionately attacking
gum.</p>

<p>The actor could, if the script demanded it and Roscoe had
screamed at him enough times, remember to shut the door when he
went out, so that it wouldn't be standing open when Lord
Blenkinsop was to be discovered standing behind it. And it made a
difference whether the door was so situated that the actor could
slip off the couch and out, or had to walk between the two
violent lovers. Even technical details mattered, perceived
Bethel. You couldn't be properly gloomy in a darkened room if a
streak of light was shooting in between two badly fastened flats.
And, useful or not, she was plain curious, like a squirrel, about
everything in the theatre.</p>

<p>She learned how to make an entire flat; laying out the thin
battens of white pine on the workbench (which, loving all
technical terms and loving to be able to annoy Iris and Toni by
using them, she was zealous to call a 'template'), fitting the
battens together&mdash;stiles on each side, top and bottom rail,
the enchantingly named 'toggle rail' in the centre, with butt
joints reinforced by corner blocks and corrugated fasteners;
turning it over, stretching canvas (which she had learned to
fireproof, with borax, sal-ammoniac and water) across the frame,
tacking it, gluing it, then on the back attaching the hardware,
brace cleats, and lash cleats for joining flat to flat to make a
complete wall.</p>

<p>She even learned to make mortise-and-tenon joints for the
shutter of a doorframe unit, and that is the jewel-work, the
higher metaphysics, of stage carpentry.</p>

<p>They did not make many new flats in a summer theatre, however;
and Bethel was expert at washing off the glue-mixed paint from
old flats and turning a section of a cottage wall into a satin
panel for a ch&acirc;teau drawing-room.</p>

<p>She liked the smell of new pine; the honest workshop floor,
rough, scurfy with dried paint in a hundred faded tones of red
and green and grey.</p>

<p>To citizens like Charley Hatch, who pictured all actresses as
lying, in scandalous neglig&eacute;es, on chaise-longues, to all
the girls of her own age whose bibles were magazines about
Hollywood, it would have been incomprehensible to see Bethel, in
vile old basketball bloomers and a cardigan, with blue paint on
the end of her nose, red paint on her knuckles, and a painful
clot of glue in her tangled hair, noisily sawing a mitre joint,
yet all the while whistling 'Old Man River', and looking up to
see the dusk grow soft on the eel grass, the golden pools of
water, at the edge of swamps across the bay.</p>

<p>Andy Deacon stopped by to wonder, 'Aren't you working
overtime?'</p>

<p>'I didn't know.'</p>

<p>'Like it?'</p>

<p>'Lots.'</p>

<p>'But why the passion for carpentry?'</p>

<p>She plumped down on the template, stared at him&mdash;the late
light shone through his coppery brush of hair&mdash;and thought
aloud:</p>

<p>'I honestly don't know. I just want to be able to do
<i>anything</i> in the theatre.'</p>

<p>'That's&mdash;that's swell!' said her poet hero. 'Maybe some
day, pretty soon, I'll have a theatrical unit of my own,
independent of the old-line producers, and if I do, you're the
kind of kid I'll want.'</p>

<p>And he looked at her as though he might actually know her
again a month from now.</p>

<p><br>
The season wound up on Saturday night, September 3rd, with a
gargantuan beach picnic: with hot dogs, roasted corn, tamales and
beer, and an enormous mulligan of beef and veal and chicken and
goose and oysters, that had been boiling on the shore all day
long, attended by Pete Chew&mdash;the best theatrical activity he
had found yet.</p>

<p>There was a quarter-moon, and quarter-music: Johnny Meddock,
the grounds custodian, on the accordion, and Butch Stevens, of
the Lobster Pot, on the mouth organ. They were, unfortunately,
more successful than that fair-faced young apprentice, Bruce
Pasture, with his violin. It was no night for Brahms. They
rioted, and sang 'Coming Round the Mountain', and danced in long,
wavering, hand-clasping lines along the sand, to conceal the
melancholy of parting. They all confessed, to-night.</p>

<p>Harry Mihick and Anita Hill and four other apprentices were
giving up the stage. (But they explained that it was only
temporary.) Pete Chew was giving up and going to work for an
uncle in Zanesville, Ohio, and Bruce Pasture was giving up and
going to Paris (left-bank) for practically the same reason: Bruce
because the Nutmeg Players spoke such primitive American that he
couldn't stand it; and Pete because they spoke such pedantic
Oxonian that he couldn't understand it. None of them, you
understand, were giving up because they hadn't proved to be very
good actors.</p>

<p>Marian was to try Broadway for one year, but in her eyes you
could see a vision of a summer theatre back in the Nebraska
cornfields. Toni Titmus was doubtful; she hinted that the Theatre
Guild was begging her to come in and see them for a part in the
Lunt-Fontanne tour, but also that an extremely rich aunt was
imploring her to spend the winter in Santa Barbara and that there
she would practically take charge of all the Little Theatre
groups.</p>

<p>Five apprentices were definitely going to plunge into
Broadway&mdash;they spoke, rather, as though they were enlisting
in a revolution&mdash;and one of them, Walter Rolf, actually had
a job... reading scripts in the office of a manager who had
almost produced a musical show in 1932 and who still had a
telephone number to prove that he was a manager.</p>

<p>As a surprise to them all&mdash;probably it was rather a
surprise to her&mdash;Andy had invited his more-or-less
fianc&eacute;e, Joan Hinterwald, down from Newport. She appeared
at a moment when they were particularly rackety. Three of the
men, who had been having a moonlight swim, wore coats and old
trousers over wet bathing suits; Anita Hill had dressed up as a
woman of the French Revolution, and Doc Keezer as a clown, with
red nose and flour cheeks; two girls were in evening clothes and
two in voluminous white slacks; and all of them were dancing in a
circle about Johnny Meddock, standing by the fire and playing
'Pop Goes the Weasel' on his accordion. The bonfire was painting
them into pirates and their molls.</p>

<p>They were aroused from their private frenzy by the hortatory
sound of a motor horn, and out of her pale green roadster, airy
in a pale green knitted suit, tripped Miss Hinterwald, waving
amiably; the princess amused by her peasants.</p>

<p>They froze. They all became, instantly, free strolling
players, the honourable company of rogues and vagrants, resentful
of secure and prosperous outsiders, whether nobility or dusty
shopkeepers. They could admit the cynical Johnny Meddock, worthy
journeyman of broom and dustpan, or Butch Stevens, oyster
huckster, but not the too-well-bathed young lady from Newport.
They forgot internal feuds; they became one harshly loyal
company: Roscoe with Bethel, Mahala with the scornful Cynthia,
Harry Mihick and Bruce Pasture, Iris Pentire and Maggie Sample.
Arm in arm, they froze and stared at Joan&mdash;for whom Bethel
was sorry, as she watched Joan freeze, too, and her white-kid
cheeks become stiff and her eyes turn hostile.</p>

<p>But instantly Bethel was sorrier for Andy, who stepped out
cheerily to greet the royal fair one, then felt around him the
hatred of his companions for her... It was <i>As You Like
It</i> rewritten by Strindberg.</p>

<p>They were silent enough to hear him hail her, 'Come join the
dance. This is a very special dance of triumph over all critics
and creditors.'</p>

<p>'Oh, thanks, but I think you can do it very nicely without me.
I'll just watch.'</p>

<p>Miss Hinterwald perched on a decayed boat and, while they
tried to resume the gaiety of the dance, she looked as though
there were no doubt in her mind that they were all, including
Andy, the loosest fools in Connecticut.</p>

<p>At supper-time, at one in the morning, sitting beside the
wretched Andy, Joan nibbled one hot dog, but refused the noble
mulligan, and immediately afterward walked toward her car and
sourly waved good-bye. But that was, for Andy, merely the
beginning of trouble. He came back to Mahala, perched on a
slightly wet rock, but Mahala did not welcome him.</p>

<p>'Hello, Maggie dear. Haven't had a chance to talk with you
this evening,' said Andy.</p>

<p>'Why should you, when you've had elegant Newport society
yearning over you?'</p>

<p>'Poor Joan! She felt out of it. I wish you knew her better.
She's really a good sport.'</p>

<p>'She wouldn't care to know <i>me</i> better. Don't kid
yourself, Andy, my bright young friend. I'm a poor working
girl&mdash;I don't act to show off, as Joanie would, but to make
a living. But you and that young woman are rich, so why do you
try and patronize me?'</p>

<p>'Oh, please, Maggie, don't you go and get complicated,
too.'</p>

<p>'No. Of course. So sorry. Working girls have no right to get
complicated. That's reserved for women that haven't anything else
to do.'</p>

<p><br>
It went on. But in concentrated venom, in off-stage staginess,
it was no better than the rival show that Bethel was watching
over to her left. And that was the spectacle of Toni Titmus
watching Pete Chew drawn by Iris Pentire's magnetic emptiness
into a fascinated circle: the rowdy Cy Fickerty, the bumbling
Harry Mihick, Doc Keezer, who was old enough to know better, the
morocco-bound Walter Rolf, who certainly did know better, and
even the aesthetic Bruce Pasture. They were all squatting on the
sand at Iris's feet as she throned it on a noble beer barrel.</p>

<p>Tudor Blackwall was looking on in delicate reproach, but in
Toni's watch over her straying Peter, there was nothing delicate
whatever. She stood, arms akimbo, like a plump model of a pioneer
woman facing a bear. She was unconscious of being observed, and
when she had stood enough, her yell of 'Pete! You come here!' was
the pioneer woman communicating across five miles of prairie.
Pete weaved over to her sheepishly. Whatever Toni said, it was
punctuated by pounding her hand with her fist.</p>

<p>'Oh dear,' sighed the lorn lone Bethel. 'I wish I had anybody
as much interested in me as Andy and Mahala are in each other, or
Pete and Toni, or Iris and the Seventh Regiment.'</p>

<p>Pete and Toni came to her arm in arm, and it was Pete who
looked proud, as though this had been his idea all along, Toni
who was shamed and halting.</p>

<p>'We want you to know&mdash;nobody else,' caroled Pete. 'The
kid and I are going to middle-aisle it. I convinced her that our
contribution to the stage will be to back shows and encourage
actors. As soon as I can get the rich uncle in Zanesville to let
us, we'll have a flat in New York and&mdash;wow!&mdash;will we
catch ourselves a Time. We'll have a lot of actors and writers
and bohemians. You must hang out there a lot.'</p>

<p>'That's fine,' said Bethel.</p>

<p><br>
Fletcher Hewitt had been stage-managing the picnic. While the
rest made suggestions and looked helpful, he stirred the
mulligan, kept the hot dogs hot, bribed Butch Stevens, with
forbidden whisky, to play his mouth organ, and soothed away five
several quarrels between Roscoe Valentine and Cynthia Aleshire.
But the food was gone now, at half past two, along with the moon,
and Fletcher had coaxed the apprentices to lug the plates and
pots up to the dormitory instead of waiting till dawn.</p>

<p>Mahala had gone off to bed. Sadly Bethel had seen Andy bid her
good night&mdash;he so pleading, Mahala so patronizing. Why
couldn't he pick someone more appreciative?</p>

<p>Fletcher wearily dropped on the sand beside Bethel, scratching
up a little pile for a pillow, looking up at the stars, holding
her hand casually, and speaking at his most casual and cool and
calm.</p>

<p>'So, Beth, it's Commencement. When do you go to New York?'</p>

<p>'After a week or ten days home. You'll be on Broadway before I
am.'</p>

<p>'No, I won't be there at all. Beth! I'm going to quit the
stage.'</p>

<p>'You're what?'</p>

<p>'I can't face another winter of tramping from office to
office, till the snow leaks in through the soles of your shoes,
looking for a job. I don't care for making much money, but I do
want to buy a few things for my mother&mdash;she's so little and
sweet and pretty&mdash;and for you.'</p>

<p>'Eh?'</p>

<p>'More and more, every day, watching you, I've decided you're
extraordinarily like her, and then I knew that someday you and I
would be married.'</p>

<p>'Eh?'</p>

<p>'Yes. You'll remember me when you're sick of hunting for
glory.'</p>

<p>'But I thought you felt the stage was sort of sacred to you
and me.'</p>

<p>'I do. And you're to have your shot at it. But I've done my
bit. And when you're tired, you'll come back to me. You see, I'm
really the hometown boy that every young actress has waiting for
her&mdash;I'm him, and not this Charley Hatch you had here.
Neighbourhoods don't matter, houses next door don't matter,
playing with the same air rifle as kids doesn't matter,
<i>time</i> doesn't matter. It's all imagination. In these ten
weeks I've become your old schoolmate, that lent you the bandanna
handkerchief when your nose bled at the party, haven't I?'</p>

<p>'Yes but.'</p>

<p>'Good. And I know what I'm going to do now. Mother and I have
been phoning. I'm going to lease a grand old inn up between
Millerton and Lakeville; swell summer business, and I think if
it's run right&mdash;and you know I <i>do</i> run that kind of
thing right?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes.'</p>

<p>'I think I can keep it full all winter. And some day I'm going
to try and turn the big old stable there into a first-rate summer
theatre. So you see? We won't be giving up the holy cause! And
anyway, Mammy and you and I will be there, and we'll have a good
serene life. Sound like fun?'</p>

<p>'Yes but.'</p>

<p>'But what?'</p>

<p>'Darling, it's hard to tell you.'</p>

<p>'But you do like me.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, Fletcher.'</p>

<p>'You know that I think you have the most beautiful
eyes&mdash;for a skinny chick&mdash;and the most graceful walk in
the world? And incidentally, if that interests you, a shining
soul. And you'd like me better and better. I think you could
depend on me.'</p>

<p>'Darling, I just can't.'</p>

<p>'Afraid of my mother complex?'</p>

<p>'I don't believe so.'</p>

<p>'In love with Andrew the Anvil King, Galahad the Grail
Hound?'</p>

<p>'Oh, what would be the use of <i>my</i> caring for him?'</p>

<p>'Plenty! He's not such a fool, even if he does let emotional
usurers like Mahala tie him up. He'll wake up someday to the fact
that you're solid&mdash;solid silver&mdash;solid gold. Mahala's
plated. He'll really see you. Would you be in love with him
then?'</p>

<p>'I might be. But I don't think it's Andy, at all. I've always
wanted the stage. I can't imagine myself without it.'</p>

<p>'But I told you, we'll try to make a summer theatre. Maybe
we'll even do some exciting experimental things. I know you and I
are the kind that could&mdash;and you'd be surprised how sound
Mammy's advice is&mdash;she's the best sport&mdash;of course you
are, too.'</p>

<p>'No! I want training. Professional training. The hardest kind.
I mustn't fool myself. In the theatre I'm of the mental age of
three. I want to have some real hard-boiled director give me the
devil. I want to do one-night stands. I want to act twenty
different roles in a year.'</p>

<p>'Well, judging from the number of shows that close in four
days, now, you'll have a chance to. And then maybe you'll be
willing to come back to hometown boy, that'll be waiting. I've
never once kissed you. I'm going to!'</p>

<p>He did. She was rather astonished.</p>

<p><br>
As the older actors began to make home-going motions of
yawning and kicking at the sand, Roscoe Valentine chased Iris off
her beer-barrel throne, climbed on it, and spoke:</p>

<p>'Boys and girls, this is our last feast of unreason together
till next summer. I now descend from my temporary grandeur as
director and become an eccentric old gentleman toying with an
arty magazine and gilded theateria in Boston. But I want to tell
all of you, <i>all</i> of you, that if I have ever seemed to ride
you, if I have ever been temperamental or unreasonable, it's only
been because I love you, and love the theatre, and have wanted to
wed these twain and&mdash;God bless you all!'</p>

<p>Maggie Sample, standing beside Bethel, muttered, 'Wouldn't you
know he'd manage to get the curtain? I wish I'd thought of that.
Anyway, Merriday, here's your chance at me. I'm no longer your
loving teacher, and you can get back at me for all my grouches.
Shoot.'</p>

<p>It is possibly a little sad, but Bethel didn't even hear her.
She was looking at the passing Andy, with firelight in his hair.
Andrew the Anvil King, Andy the Grail Hound, Andy the
Paladin.</p>

<p><br>
Everybody drifted away. Bethel, in her dormitory room, now
light with dawn, listened to Iris snorting that she was sure
<i>she</i> didn't want Pete Chew hanging around her and Toni
could <i>have</i> him, for all she cared.</p>

<p>Bethel decided that she couldn't sleep. She crept downstairs,
stole a horrible cold griddle cake and wolfed it, and slipped out
to the beach again. And there, solitary, looking out to the
dreary dishwater of morning sea, his back to her, squatted with
hands on knees, was Andy.</p>

<p>She came up to him cautiously. He looked up and snorted,
'Hello, kitten. What you doing up?'</p>

<p>'I couldn't get to sleep.'</p>

<p>'Neither could I.'</p>

<p>'Andy! What's trouble? You look unhappy.'</p>

<p>'Hell, I am! I'm sick of running around with garlands in my
hair yelping that I'm artistic and happy. It's all a mess.'</p>

<p>'People?'</p>

<p>'Eh? Oh, I don't mean my lady-loves. Mahala and Joan are good
girls&mdash;though I do sometimes wish that they could take out
their undoubted powers in work, as apparently you can, Beth,
instead of in getting their little feelings hurt. But it's not
that. It's career. Work. Art. Ambition. Purpose. Looking at the
apprentices to-night, I've been thinking: nice bunch of kids, but
what have they got out of this summer? Picnickers, that's what
they are&mdash;that's what I am. What have Roscoe and I done?
Good plays, but not one new one in try-out&mdash;not even one
unusual one, not one profound characterization in the acting,
mine or anybody's. I've been doing my parts on my head. That Zed
Wintergeist that came up here from Dory Playhouse said we were
Boy Scouts. He was right. The genial Mr. Andy Deacon! Why does he
waste his time so, Bethel? Why does he?'</p>

<p>She patted his hand, and together they looked out as a young
rosy light quivered on the slaty waves.</p>

<p>'Andy, I've learned to relax here, and feel at home on the
stage, and I learned it from watching you, so sure and so easy,
and not from listening to Roscoe shrieking.'</p>

<p>'Maybe both you and I need more shrieking at. But&mdash;You
really have enjoyed it?'</p>

<p>'Incredibly.'</p>

<p>'I'm glad.'</p>

<p>And already, with the rising flood of light, the spirits of
the mercurial Andy were rising. He rose, lifting her up, and
cried, 'We have left undone the things we ought to have done, but
this coming season, we'll be swell! On to New York, kitten! We'll
have our names in electric lights there before spring!
Absolutely!'</p>

<p>She wanted to wail, 'But I'll never see you, once you get to
New York.' Violently she kept herself from it, as he chanted
on:</p>

<p>'You saw <i>Our Town,</i> didn't you? Remember the end:</p>

<p>'"Everybody's resting in Grover's Corners. To-morrow's going
to be another day. You get a good rest, too. Good night."'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<p class="first">RED&mdash;the colour of revolution, the colour
of anger, of angry eyes, of vigorous dawn and wild sunsets, of
battle smoke, of rubies on the breast of courtesans&mdash;red,
acid red, carmine, crimson, scarlet, madder, vermilion, flaunting
rose.</p>

<p>From the window of her minute room, high in a hotel-for-women
in the East Fifties in Manhattan, Bethel saw the whole welter of
city turn red as the evening rain began. In the country the wet
lonely night would have dissolved in shifting grey, but New York,
in the late-October rain, was the pit of a volcano, and more
insistent, and more dreadful.</p>

<p>Atop the white mountainous cliff of the R.C.A. Building, in
Radio City, a crimson aeroplane-beacon was rotating, crossing a
white shaft of light that shot straight up to the illimitable
heavens, to be lost in the orbit of the farthest star. The
sloping top of the General Electric Building (not of the De
Medicis or Plantagenets or Barbarossas were these high castles,
but of the lords of radio and electric heating), like a jewel
casket of the giants, turned from alternate crimson to pallid
gold.</p>

<p>Backing these prickly towers, the light from Broadway was a
dome of writhing fire, until, unwarning, a menacing billow of fog
enveloped the burning sky, and the fantastic sanguine spire of
the distant Empire State Building was wiped clean out. In the
streets below her the red glare still pierced the melancholy
rain. On the wet pavement the motors whirred more loudly, the
tail-lights mimicked the scarlet of the stop lights, and when
Bethel looked to the left, to Lexington Avenue, she was uneasy at
the flaming neon signs aggressively thrust out above shop
windows.</p>

<p>Ten thousand cherry-lighted windows piled up in tier on tier
in office buildings, and behind them were a hundred thousand
windows unlit, and weary with memory of the day's toil. It was a
mighty, proud and terrifying city, an Orient city in red lacquer
lit with red lights, a crimson barbaric city, and it was all
hers&mdash;to conquer or be crushed.</p>

<p>It was after ten; she had napped for three hours of the
evening, and she was hungry in a thin, petulant way, and her head
ached, her legs felt shaky from want of food. But she sat on by
the window unmoving.</p>

<p>She couldn't rouse the energy to go all the long way down the
hotel corridor, down in the elevator, whose cheery young woman
pilot would with depressing inevitability remark, 'Pretty wet to-
night', out through a lobby explosive with young women being
emptily merry with dreary male visitors, down the soaking street
to a fish-stinking hole of a cheap restaurant. She was afraid to
go out. She couldn't, not again to-day, face the heartless,
anonymous, moving human detritus on the sidewalks. She was
lonely, up here in this bright coop, but she was less lonely than
scared.</p>

<p>Her little room was a miracle of compression. It must have
been planned by an architect trained in designing prison cells,
folding picnic baskets, and combination vanity sets and cigarette
cases. To enable it to offer what was known in the circle of girl
job seekers as 'a good respectable address on the East Side, just
off Park Avenue', at only ten dollars a week (without food;
jobless girls didn't need food; just addresses and silk stockings
and a kind word), the builders had imaginatively got the
furnishings of a two-room apartment into the space of a hall
bedroom.</p>

<p>Everything conceivable to the genius of American gadgetry was
here, but reduced below tolerable human size, and fitted together
without six square inches of the waste space that could be used
only for walking, relaxing, dreaming or any other merely human
need: bed, reading lamp and bedside table, upholstered arm-chair,
combination bookcase and desk and radio and bureau, and a
dressing-table so elegant that in the advertisements it would be
referred to as 'milady's'. And a bathroom. It was nearly possible
to sit in the tub and reach out and write a letter, open the hall
door, open the window or answer the telephone.</p>

<p>It was Modern enough for any Merriday. Only, daily, Bethel was
becoming less Modern and more insistent about getting an old-
fashioned job on some old-fashioned stage.</p>

<p>She was daily more timid about her dream, phonograph-
engendered, of appearing not in the bare, pine-platform
simplicity of Grampion, but on a great stage, jewel-lighted,
lofty as Canterbury, with Noel Coward and Yvonne Printempts. Now
she wanted any stage, with anyone.</p>

<p><br>
Her timidity and tiredness won over her undoubted common
sense, and for the third time in ten days she did not go out to
dinner at all but, after nibbling at a chocolate bar and drinking
a glass of water from the tap in the tile-and-nickel bathroom,
she sat down to type the script of Tudor Blackwall's
play&mdash;and that script typing was the nearest she had yet
come in New York to being associated with anything
theatrical.</p>

<p>At Grampion, Tudor Blackwall, second leading man, had never
paid her any attention beyond murmuring, 'How are you, blessed?'
and borrowing a match. But he was the first of the Nutmeg Players
that she encountered in New York. She ran into him at lunch at
the Olde Roanoke Drug Store, at Broadway and Forty-sixth Street,
which is the chief club, restaurant, news bureau and matrimonial
agency of all young actors looking for jobs.</p>

<p>He invited her to his flat for dinner. She had heard about the
horrors of going alone to a man's flat, but Tudor seemed to her
extraordinarily safe, and she took a chance.</p>

<p>He cooked dinner for her&mdash;a very good dinner, and very
well cooked: onion soup and kidney stew and profiterolles with
chocolate sauce. She discovered that he, who looked twenty-five
and prosperous, with his sleek waistcoats and shoes fitting like
gloves, was thirty-five and very hard up indeed, and that a part
of his lovely glass-smooth black hair was a toupee.</p>

<p>He laughed about it all, and told her how unsuccessful he was,
as though they were two girls together, and admitted that the
silky superciliousness with which he had treated the apprentices
at Grampion had been to keep these innocents from discovering
that he was sickeningly uncomfortable with all strangers, and
that his average yearly earning was two thousand dollars.</p>

<p>And he didn't borrow money.</p>

<p>She knew enough now to be prepared for that; she had even done
hasty calculations indicating that five dollars was all she could
afford. But he did read her a play he had just finished&mdash;he
finished it every year at about this time&mdash;and he begged her
to copy it for him.</p>

<p>It was a good play. It always has been, and when it is written
by Noel Coward, S. N. Behrman, Philip Barry, or Samson
Raphaelson, it even gets produced, to considerable glory. The
hero was Cecil Gisthorpe, and he was a playwright, and he was
witty, and he didn't really care a hoot when his girl was taken
from him by a flannel-mouthed radical&mdash;but also
witty&mdash;named Steve Grimston. There were cocktails and
cigarettes in it, and an eccentric maid&mdash;also witty.</p>

<p>Bethel thought it was 'simply lovely', and said so, and Tudor
said she was the nicest kid he had met for years and they would
be great friends, and she said yes, and he bowed over her hand,
and she took the script back to her hotel to copy it. That was a
week ago, and she had almost finished. One of the few things on
which her father had ever insisted in high school was that she
should learn typing, and by the touch system. She blessed him
now&mdash;though that was nothing sensational, for she usually
did bless him. She was aware, after these six weeks of job
hunting in New York, that she might not find any theatrical job
whatever this year; that if she did get one, it would be an
accident; and that she could not endure her family's going on
stinting themselves in order to send her twenty-five dollars a
week.</p>

<p>Probably she would have to be a stenographer till her dramatic
miracle happened... though by now she was beginning to see
that the employers of stenographers, too, were not excited by the
chance of hiring young ladies with B.A. degrees, nice ankles and
modest manners.</p>

<p>If she was going to get an office job, she told herself, she
had to be <i>good</i> (not meaning it, apparently, in any moral
sense, but only in reference to words-per-minute, a memory for
telephone numbers, and such unpoetic slave virtues). Very well,
she would be good!</p>

<p>Her typing was already tolerable, and her vocabulary was
unusual, she concluded, after talking in employment bureaus and
the anterooms of offices with candidates for stenography who
seemed rather proud of themselves as exhibits of the renowned
American free public school system if they could type anything so
flawless as 'We acknowledge yours of the 5th instant and wourd
asure you that we are shiping yours consinement at once to
Niajerrer Falls'.</p>

<p>An hour a week, she was taking shorthand lessons with her one
lone hometown acquaintance in urban wilds&mdash;her mother's
cousin, a spinster secretary from Sladesbury, who was always
parched with longing to hear from Bethel the details of the
glamorous, naughty parties to which, as an actress, she must be
going. And to practise the black art of shorthand, Bethel took
down the free lectures in the schools, and sermons and political
speeches on the radio.</p>

<p>Her back stung at last from typing, and she arose from the
aphorisms of Tudor Blackwall's script and achingly undressed and
crawled into the narrow sheath of her bed.</p>

<p>She was, normally, a cheerful person, and no hermit. She told
herself, as she twitched into shallow sleep, that she must look
up the other Grampionites here. She had not looked them up; she
didn't want to impose on them. She had had one letter from Pete
and Toni, now married in Zanesville and married to Zanesville.
Toni talked airily of 'hitting the Big Town in a big way this
winter', but she also wrote so familiarly of 'her' riding master
and of the country-club dances that Bethel felt that all of
Toni's dramatic genius, all that talent for dancing the rumba and
the Lambeth Walk (the favourite mumbo rite of late 1938), all
that ability to remain awake at three a.m. even after eight
highballs, all that emotion-coloured memory which enabled her to
recognize Franchot Tone and Loretta Young and Jessie Royce Landis
and W. C. Fields on the street and to recall at what hour Edgar
Bergen could be heard on WEAF, those uncommon glories of smooth
knees and rounded breast, were lost to the artistic world for
ever, and what was Broadway's tragedy was Zanesville's delighted
gain.</p>

<p>Once Bethel had talked to Marian Croy on the telephone and,
hesitatingly, had refused to share a room with her.</p>

<p>Bethel had a formless, confused notion that it would be better
to read plays (borrowed from the Fifty-seventh Street Branch
Library, the young actor's British Museum) than to listen to a
boiling of Marian's friends chattering all evening about: 'I got
it straight from a man that knows John Mason Brown personally,
and he says Jed Harris is going to put on a radical revue, and
they'll be hiring forty-two girls for bits and walk-ons right
away.'</p>

<p>Once, in the Olde Roanoke's mammoth basement restaurant,
Bethel had seen Iris Pentire, alone, delicately nibbling at Blue
Plate Luncheon No. 5 (chilled tomato stuffed with egg salad,
garnish of whole olives and radishes, rolls, butter, and
beverage, 45 c.), and waiting to ignore some young male as soon
as one should notice her enough for her to ignore him.</p>

<p>Of Mahala Vale and Doc Keezer and Maggie Sample, she had heard
nothing whatever; of Andrew Deacon, nothing beyond a note, in
Leonard Lyons's column in the New York <i>Post,</i> that Andy,
with his mother and Miss Joan Hinterwald, had been staying at a
Great Neck ch&acirc;teau, and telling some very funny stories
about summer theatres.</p>

<p>Flushing as she lay there trying to sleep, Bethel hoped that
none of the funny stories had been about her.</p>

<p><br>
She was out on her gaggingly familiar round of job hunting at
ten next morning, after the actress's toilet of bathing and
powdering and manicuring and hairdressing, and choosing between
the blue silk frock and the grey suit, and after saving ten cents
by having only orange juice, toast and nice refreshing hot water
for breakfast. (She was young rather than fundamentally
imbecile.)</p>

<p>She walked to the office of Equity, the actors' organization,
and, with a milling of other girl crusaders, studied the bulletin
board with its notices of who was casting, who was organizing a
road company.</p>

<p>She was not a member, and not supposed to intrude there, but
as she couldn't join Equity till she had a contract, and as she
probably never would get a contract till she was a member of
Equity, such trespass as hers was tolerated. The paradox which
ruled all young actresses was that you couldn't get a job if you
hadn't the experience, and you certainly could not get experience
till you had a job, and so you just weren't going to <i>get</i> a
job.</p>

<p>Bethel started another day of high artistic hopes with the
usual matutinal conclusion that there were no jobs left in the
world.</p>

<p>She walked&mdash;every dainty young flower of the stage walks
far enough every day to disable a hairy infantryman&mdash;to the
palatial offices of Hochwohlgeboren &amp; Schnitzel. In the outer
room was a sign 'No casting', and a twitter of young ladies who
were trying to ignore the sign. She walked to the offices of Sam
&amp; Rufus Kitz, and got no farther than a cold-hearted girl
reception clerk who gabbled, 'Wha's name any-experience
cnleaveyrtelephone number'. She walked to the offices of
Thorncroft, Inc., where a graceful young man murmured 'Cast's all
full for <i>California Cavalcade</i> except big rangy blondes,
and that let's you out, darling'. She walked to the office of
Cyril Sassoon Solobar, and found that Mr. Solobar was his own
secretary and office boy. A round man, bald in layers, he sat
hunched at a scarred desk, held her hand, pinched her side and
whined, 'No, I haven't got the script of <i>Towers of Teheran</i>
yet. The author's holding out on me. How's for lunch, babe?' She
walked to the office of a new agent of whom a girl waiting at
Kitz's had said that he took beginners and got them nice
jobs.</p>

<p>He didn't.</p>

<p>And now, at one-thirty, she walked for her one comparatively
substantial meal of the day to the Olde Roanoke Drug Store.</p>

<p><br>
Forty years ago, two bustling pharmacists from Maine named
Rowen and Oaks, opening a drugstore in the wilderness at Broadway
and Forty-sixth, were moved to be facetious, to pretend that they
were from the flower of what they called Ole Virginny, and to
combine their names in the designation Ole Roanoke.</p>

<p>It is an urban version of the Rex Pharmacy of Sladesbury, and,
even in alien New York, it is as American as flapjacks.</p>

<p>It still has a kingly trade in perfumes and soaps and face
powder, and a small rush of prescriptions, but its glories are
the lunch counter upstairs, where the least prosperous of would-
be actors deceive their miserable stomachs with sandwiches and
jumbo malted milks while they listen anxiously to the news over
the theatrical grapevine, and, downstairs, the vast restaurant,
which fills the basement floor, where, in daily hundreds, the
not-quite-so-impoverished actors meet to look at each other, to
show off their new costumes and makeups, to hear the labour-
market news and subordinately to eat.</p>

<p>The basement room itself is of battleship grey, and the
ceilings bristly with water pipes, but the proprietors have
craftily covered the walls with mirrors, so that, as they talk,
the young things can stare at their images, study their own
experiments in the Arch Smile, the Appealing Smile, the Wistful
Regret. They eat in booths along the wall, or at tables elbow to
elbow out on the floor. The waitresses, showy in white-and-cherry
uniforms with green berets, are hostesses, comforters,
reconcilers, and free employment agents.</p>

<p>Alone, rather alarmingly filling up on the 'Hot Spot Special:
Salisbury steak, julienne carrots, whipped potatoes, lemon
chiffon pie, coffee, 40 c.' Bethel watched and, since they were
at the next table and not at all shy about their humour, listened
to one 'Bunk', a young man with grey, double-breasted jacket,
green, purple, and brown chequed shirt, and red plaid
handkerchief, 'Ally', a girl with a wolf jacket and a tall, cone-
shaped lettuce-green hat with royal blue streamers setting off a
chartreuse-coloured dress that disdained her knees, and 'Peg', a
child of nineteen with yellow hair to her shoulders and a
cartwheel straw hat hung with a black ribbon on the back of her
neck.</p>

<p>Bethel, in grey suit and frilly jabot exquisitely ironed (by
Bethel, in her bathroom), felt a cool and collegian superiority
to these plush flowers until she remembered hearing a handsome
girl in black, at the Roanoke, snarl, 'I'm a B.A. of Vassar and
an M.A. of Columbia and I'd swap 'em both for a two-line bit in a
show that opened in Cain's Warehouse.'</p>

<p>'Gee, you got a lovely tan, Bunk,' said Ally. 'Where you been?
Steal somebody's Alpine lamp?'</p>

<p>'No, I'm an actor, b'God. Been stealing applause!'</p>

<p>'Quit it or I'll wake up.'</p>

<p>'Fact. I've been out on the Borsch circuit all summer.
Nineteen dollars a week and coffee and cakes and a nice bed over
the garage&mdash;three in the bed. We had a swell bill: the six
dirtiest scenes from the six dirtiest plays in the last six
years. Symbolism, heh? We played a seven-hotel circuit, one a
night. I can't kick. I come back engaged to the daughter of the
biggest kosher butcher in Schenectady&mdash;if I can find her
address&mdash;and I got a swim every day.'</p>

<p>Bunk studied Ally in a bright, sexless, beaming way and
jeered, 'I see you've got new lashes and a new mouth.'</p>

<p>'Yeah, my complexion's been bad, so I've been giving up make-
up for a while and concentrating on my eyes and mouth. Maybe some
producer will see me here and say, "I never knew Ally had a mouth
like that. We ought to be able to use a mouth like that for
something!"'</p>

<p>From Peggy, jeering, 'You know what he'll use the mouth for
now that you've gone coy and got your hat out of the way of
kissing.'</p>

<p>From Bunk to Peg, 'That'll be all from you, you heel. I swear
to God, you <i>like</i> appearing with the Y.W.C.A.
nonprofessional groups! Go on back home!'</p>

<p>From Peg, 'Not me! I was there all summer. In Elmira. God, was
I bored! The folks had a fit if I wanted to sleep after ten. They
wanted me to play tennis and marry a lawyer&mdash;calls hisself a
lawyer!&mdash;he's a clerk in a law factory with six partners! So
I come back looking for a job where I can prove what bums Kate
Hepburn and Tallulah are. But I dunno. My big trouble is I'm too
individual a type&mdash;a marked <i>ing&eacute;nue</i> and yet
sophisticated. My sister's got more sense than me. She's taken up
Physical Ed. She's already got a job. She's safer than I am, in
this lousy theatre racket. I dunno. Yesterday I got to see this
bum Mack Pzister that calls himself a producer. He's new to the
show business. I think he makes his dough out of some kind of
mine promotion.'</p>

<p>'He's a heel. He's an exhibitionist,' said Ally. 'It peps up
his dirty little snow-white personality to think he's a real the-
at-ri-cal producer. He just lu-loves the dray-ma, and seeing he
can't act and he can't direct and he can't write and he's too
lazy and dumb to shift scenery, that makes him a producer, the
sweet potato that puts up the money&mdash;only I understand Mack
ain't got any money either. I know for a fact, six times in the
last two years he's sent out a call for casting and interviewed
about a thousand bright young things and kept 'em coming back,
and nobody ever heard anything more about the show. Did he make a
pass at you, Peg?'</p>

<p>'Huh? Don't be silly. And I could almost like Mack. He's got
such a cute moustache. Of course he's got a wife and children.
Maybe she's cold. I dunno. You been in summer stock, haven't you,
Ally?'</p>

<p>'Yuh. Up at Whale Hollow, upstate, and did I get a raw deal! I
knew that director, Carv Bledaud, was a heel. Oh, last spring, I
was nuts about it. My first real job. Remember I came into the
Roanoke here yelling "To-day is a very big day. To-day is a day
that will go down in history. The history of the theatre will
star this date along with the death of Joe Jefferson and the
birth of Shirley Temple". But all the time my intuition told me
it was the bunk. When my intuition tells me something, I always
know it's right, but I'd do <i>anything&mdash;</i>except let a
lot of screwballs make love to me&mdash;to get on the stage.
Well, I got up there, and I found Bledaud was a washout. He never
read clear through a script before he started 'directing', and
there were only 278 seats in the house, and the stage is so small
that when they put on a chariot race, they use carpet sweepers.
Oh, I stuck it out, but I never had a part more'n six sides. I
was disgusted.... Where you living, Bunk?'</p>

<p>'Three of us got a furnished room with a kitchenette, in the
West Fifties.'</p>

<p>'I'm going to stick it out at the Y.W.C.A., though all the
bosses there try to persuade you to go back home to your
beautiful home in Scranton and marry the boy friend. <i>My</i>
beautiful home's next to the Adventist Church&mdash;you can hear
'em singing all Saturday morning, when you want to
sleep&mdash;and the boy friend is a grocer, but even if my folks
lived in a penthouse, I'd stick it out here. Nobody can keep me
from succeeding on the stage! If I get just a little more busted,
maybe I can get on the Federal Theatre Project. They don't take
you there for how well you can act but for had badly you can earn
a living. But anyway, I'll stick it if it takes ten years.'</p>

<p>Bunk half rose. 'I got to get out and chase a job. I'm an
actor. As beautiful as you two dolls are, I'll never make a dime
here.'</p>

<p>Said Peg, 'Don't take all the jobs to-day. Keep a few for
another day. You coming back from the Borsch circuit with all
that dough saved up! I knew you were in the chips the minute I
saw you. You had your face washed and your hair combed.'</p>

<p>Bunk settled down again and ordered a coffee. 'Saved up?
Listen! The minute my old man found I had a job, he started
panhandling...'</p>

<p><br>
Bethel knew that the three would stay here all afternoon,
talking of nothing but the stage&mdash;nothing but their
particular chances of positions on the stage; that they would be
back here at their caf&eacute; of futility to-morrow and the next
day, next year and the year after, till they vanished into that
undiscoverable limbo where, dead or still living, float all the
young actors and novelists and prize fighters and promoters of
billion-dollar sun-power plants whose exhibitionism was too great
for their talent and whose talent was too great for farming.</p>

<p><br>
Bethel had been reared to the solid American Protestant belief
in the glory and efficacy of human will power. If anyone wanted
enough to do anything, he would unquestionably do it, and his
resoluteness was somehow very beautiful, even if his ambition was
to devour the moon or become the Queen of Sheba.</p>

<p>Every minute, among the young things seated in rows in
managers' waiting-rooms, Bethel heard them bravely and just a bit
noisily vowing, 'I will make good on the stage, and nothing can
stop me'.</p>

<p>That was inspiring. That was how we built the Union
Pacific.</p>

<p>But she saw that a number of those who were most courageously
willing to give-up-everything for their careers believed that the
giving-up-everything automatically extended to their families and
friends, and that it was the natural duty of their fathers to go
on sending them funds and of their barest acquaintances to go on
'lending' them money, while, year on year, they sat in
restaurants and enjoyed their artistic martyrdom.</p>

<p>This was all very confusing to Bethel. Was she a real worker,
or just another soft little faker in a funny hat? Um. Well, she'd
prove herself. She wouldn't for ever let her father go on
supporting her. She'd type or wait on table or model or
<i>something.</i> Meanwhile it depressed her to see that there
were hundreds of authentic, nonboasting aspirants who seemed to
be as good as she. If she ever did have her chance on the stage,
it would be mostly by accident.</p>

<p>A horrible dislocation, this present theatrical situation. No
wonder the young Communists at the Olde Roanoke were able to be
eloquent! For every actual stage job, there were ten brilliant
young actors being considered, a hundred who ought to be
considered, and a thousand heartbroken youngsters, ranging from
good to atrocious, who thought they ought to be. And when someone
out of the thousand, anyone, finally was signed for the role, all
the other nine hundred and ninety-nine wailed that this was the
blackest example of favouritism, incompetence and sickening bad
taste in all the history of the arts.</p>

<p>Why, she sharply asked herself, did she go on being huddled in
this herd, as just one of the thousand?</p>

<p>As she paid her check and wearily climbed up from the
basement, Bethel decided that she would never go to the Olde
Roanoke again.</p>

<p><br>
There was a standard debate among the job hunters as to
whether it was better to try to see the producers in the morning
or in the afternoon. Bethel did both. This afternoon she knocked
at the granite portals of two more theatrical tombs, then turned
to that new heaven and high ambition, that putative new bed and
bread and butter of the young actor, the radio.</p>

<p>To apply for tests for broadcasting, that ethereal art whereby
the sweetness of the human voice is wafted to the listening
seraphim ten trillion light-years away, she went not to a star-
capped and venerable master of the air waves but to young men, in
advertising agency offices, who would&mdash;just
possibly&mdash;tell older men in the agency that, look, here's a
kid that prob'ly she's no good but we might let her have a
test.</p>

<p>She sat across a desk from a young man with eyeglasses and
premature baldness.</p>

<p>'Come back in about a week. There might be something doing on
the Cadgbury Health Salts Hour. How about coming out for a little
dinner with me some night, Miss Dairyvale?' said the young
man.</p>

<p>By now there was less pious horror than ritual boredom in her
refusal.</p>

<p>She could not afford to, but at six she stopped in at a chain
restaurant, where doughnuts were served on Medici tessellation,
to have tea and toast, and to ask her waitress about a restaurant
job.</p>

<p>'You got to have experience, and there's a long waiting list,
anyway,' said the young woman.</p>

<p>Back home in her hotel, Bethel asked of the girl elevator
runner, 'How do you go about getting a job like yours?'</p>

<p>'Busted, dearie? Then you better go home. No chance on the
elevators. There's only a few buildings in town use
girls&mdash;mostly hospitals and medical buildings&mdash;and when
a girl leaves, she usually gets the job handed on to her lady
friend. And of course you got to have experience before you can
run an elevator,' said the operator, as the floors slipped
downward past them.</p>

<p>'How do you get experience running an elevator if you don't
get a chance to <i>run</i> an elevator?' sighed Bethel.</p>

<p>The young woman looked at her with dark suspicion. 'I don't
know. But that's the rule.'</p>

<p><br>
She was safely home again. She wasn't sure what had happened
to her artistic integrity this day, but she did know that her
feet were sore.</p>

<p>Again she slept till after nine in the evening.</p>

<p>She woke up and sat waiting for the telephone to ring. She
imagined Walter Rolf, Marian Croy, even Iris Pentire calling her
up, inviting her to some vague, exciting theatrical party; she
imagined Pete and Toni, unexpectedly arrived in town, demanding
that she come to Twenty-One or Sardi's. She was so lonely that
she was frightened. The sound of the city blurred in one
relentless mumbling.</p>

<p>She forced herself to get up, pat her face with witch hazel,
go downstairs past the elevator girls, the pages, the clerks,
who, she fancied, were suspicious of her idleness, and walk ten
blocks to a Chinese restaurant, where for thirty cents you could
dine lavishly on chow mein and rice and tea and spicy fruits
floating in pale syrup. But she fled back to the refuge of her
bright lone room.</p>

<p><br>
Thrice a week she went to the Class in Acting conducted by
that lanky Polish demon, Sol Gadto; an echo of the Group Theatre
discipline, with memories of Stanislavski. The students had most
of them been inconspicuously on the stage already; they were
afire with the purpose of great acting; they looked down on the
Olde Roanoke loafers almost as much as the Olde Roanoke free
souls looked down on their father and brothers.</p>

<p>The class cost five dollars a week. Bethel could not have
afforded it, but Mr. Gadto, a theatrical fanatic who lived on
brandy, hope and rich widows, told her with jeers and
objurgations that she could pay him when she had her first
engagement.</p>

<p>Gadto had assigned to her the part of Laura, the girl in
<i>Men in White</i> who could not keep her lover. Bethel went
through the lines with spirit, trying to reveal
Laura&mdash;spoiled, a good sort, demanding, filled with a plain
decent honesty. Bethel was rather proud of the gestures she had
devised to illustrate the character: the airy circles with her
cigarette holder when at heart she was agonized; the mouth
upturned in luring.</p>

<p>That red-eyed buzzard Sol Gadto, as he listened to her, curled
in his chair in their bare rehearsal hall, with both elbows
against his belly, as though it ached, moving only to tap his
teeth with a lax right hand in which drooped a cigarette.</p>

<p>When she was finished, he droned:</p>

<p>'That's a little better. But you're getting into a lot of
fancy little movements that decorate action&mdash;oh yes, they
decorate it, all right, and make it interesting&mdash;if you tied
a pink ribbon on an archbishop's nose, it would make him
interesting enough.</p>

<p>'How often have I got to tell you that every single movement
of your whole body has got to grow out of your realization of
what the character is feeling and thinking at that moment, and
not for the sake of doing something? Now I want you to go and sit
down and do what's sometimes called "sense memory". Put yourself
back in some moment when you wanted to keep some boy and you felt
at once sore and like a fool. Quit trying to act for the next ten
minutes and put yourself in charge of that emotion. And sit still
while you do it.'</p>

<p><br>
Bethel could not recall any incident in which she had been a
lady left and lorn. She had been rather glad when Charley Hatch
had blithely turned her down for a girl with teeth. She thought
of Fletcher Hewitt; she realized that she had not answered, for a
week now, a letter in which Fletcher had told of painting their
dilapidated inn, building bookcases, putting in plumbing. It was
idiotic that she couldn't adore Fletcher, the while she
worshipped at the shining feet of an Andrew Deacon who considered
her merely a little chit to be kind to. In six weeks now he would
have forgotten her name.</p>

<p>Andy... His small-boy grin. His rigid, President Coolidge
insistence that Roscoe Valentine pay the theatre bills and answer
all the letters. His bellow as he swam out through the tide rips,
the sun-stroked hair on his arms like golden mail. His patience
with that gilded shrew, Mahala. His beautiful coarseness in
<i>Fumed Oak</i> and his beautiful gallantry in <i>Tovarich.</i>
And she had never heard from him&mdash;there was no reason why
she ever should hear from him&mdash;if she could just once see
him at a restaurant....</p>

<p>Gadto was calling her out of her trance, 'Let's try it
again.'</p>

<p>She trotted up on the small platform, and it was no stage
character, composed of paper and typewriter ink, that she was
playing this time, but a muted, suffering woman who would have
given anything to blow up in hysteria, to throw inkwells at the
admirable young doctor, to yell, to tear out somebody's eyes...
 maybe Mahala's.</p>

<p>The director said 'Good', and for Mr. Sol Gadto, that was
practically raving.</p>

<p><br>
Mr. Gadto lived in the 'Village', and she returned
uptown&mdash;to the Olympian groves of theatrical managers'
offices and bus stations and Italian restaurants and hand
laundries and grimy hotels&mdash;by subway. She was fascinated by
the medley of people in the car: old Negro women with bundles,
well-dressed, intelligent-looking young Negro women of the new
urban colonies, old men mumbling into beards, resentful boys.</p>

<p>It tormented her that she could never know them, find out what
they were like; that this young woman across the car, with her
shocked, staring eyes, would in three minutes be leaving the car
and be shut off from her for ever by the iron doors and the
relentless speed of the departing subway train. If she could
better understand that woman, she could act all unhappy women,
for ever.</p>

<p>Here was a whole maddening city of people that she wanted to
act&mdash;whom maybe she really could act&mdash;if she could ever
get up on any stage to act anybody at all.</p>

<p><br>
She lunched at a Coffee Pot Restaurant, where the only guest
suggesting the theatrical profession was a sandwich man. In
defiance of her budget she had bought an afternoon paper and,
having been deprived of stage gossip for an entire four hours
now, she turned feverishly to the 'News of the Theatres'
column.</p>

<p>Heading the column was the announcement, written with typical
New York contempt for all places outside Manhattan:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote"> Andrew Deacon, who last winter was the leading
man and co-director in <i>The Best of Times,</i> is organizing a
touring company to play <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> in modern dress.
This is believed to be the first time that the play has been thus
costumed. Mr. D. indicates that he is going to use a number of
his last summer's associates in the Grampion straw-hat
aggregation of which he was co-producer. He is uninformative as
to when he will attack Broadway, but he has definite bookings in
a score of culture depots in the mail-order territory.</p>

<br>

<p>With a comic vision of Iris Pentire losing her Mona Lisa calm
and Mahala her Ritz dignity and Tudor Blackwall his sleek
superiority as, like herself, they dashed for bus and taxi, to
reach Andy Deacon, Bethel left her steak sandwich unfinished and
galloped to her hotel and to her telephone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<p class="first">SHE telephoned to the small hotel of Marian
Croy. No answer. She scrabbled through memoranda, found Iris
Pentire's address, telephoned again, and again no answer. For
weeks she had kept from going near Walter Rolf and the small
office of the small producer for whom he was reading very small
playscripts, lest Walter think she was asking him to help her,
but now she threw away her delicacy.</p>

<p>Walter was very kind; on the telephone he even said
something&mdash;something you couldn't quite pin down&mdash;about
their having dinner together; but he didn't know where Andy
Deacon was. Reckless then, she telephoned to <i>Variety,</i> and
the telephone girl answered, as though she had given the same
answer many times that day, 'He's at the Hotel Picardy, Park
Avenue'.</p>

<p>She kept herself from the frenzy of taking a taxicab, but she
almost ran across to Park Avenue, skimming a block out of her way
to an old-book shop, where she primly bought a second-hand copy
of the Tudor <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i></p>

<p>She had realized that Andy represented wealth, but she was so
acquainted with him as a khaki-trousered beachcomber that she was
shy when she encountered him as a bustling Man of Affairs. In the
ducal Hotel Picardy he had two suites: his own duplex apartment
and a smaller extra one across the hall as a concentration camp
for inquiring actors. It was to this secondary, overflow suite
that Bethel was directed at the hotel desk.</p>

<p>She entered a plum-coloured drawing-room richly filled with
every sort of overstuffed furniture that a sensible person could
not possibly want. Facing the door, at an incongruous metal desk,
was a Miss Sally Carpet, a young woman made entirely of glass,
typing so rapidly that it looked vicious.</p>

<p>'Yes?' said the glass lady.</p>

<p>She had clipped some of the normal sounds out of even that
inextensive word, and pretty well got it down to 'ys'.</p>

<p>'I'd like to see Mr. Andrew Deacon, please.'</p>

<p>'Nappointment?'</p>

<p>'No, I'm a friend of his.'</p>

<p>'Snamepls?'</p>

<p>'Bethel Merriday.'</p>

<p>'Wastabout casting?'</p>

<p>'Yes, please.'</p>

<p>'Spearance?' (Bethel concluded that this meant 'Have you had
any experience?' but it may have signified 'Do you expect me to
approve of your appearance?' or 'Do you spear your aunts?')</p>

<p>'I was with Mr. Deacon at Grampion last summer.'</p>

<p>'Oh. Another one! Well, I suppose he'll want to see you.
Excuse me if I'm a crank, dearie, but nine-tenths of the babies
that come in here either were playing in <i>The Women</i> or
<i>Our Town</i> last year&mdash;under the stage name of Marlene
Dietrich, I guess&mdash;or they got soused once with one of
Andy's sisters.'</p>

<p>'Oh. Has he sisters?'</p>

<p><i>'Has</i> he? <i>Ask</i> me!' With which mystifying demand,
Miss Sally Carpet went across the hall to announce her. Days
later, Bethel found that Andy decidedly had no sisters.</p>

<p>Andy himself met her in the entryway of the main
apartment&mdash;yet was this Andy, this Hollywood creation in
double-breasted blue suit, light blue shirt, dark blue tie,
spats, sleeked hair, and a titanic seal ring with what she
supposed to be armorial bearings?</p>

<p>He shouted, 'This is wonderful that you've come, darling!
You're just the girl I've been looking for! I want you to meet
the greatest director in the world&mdash;Adrian Satori...
Adrian, this is one of my discoveries!
Bethel&mdash;Bethel&mdash;oh, damn it, sweet, what <i>is</i> your
last name?'</p>

<p>To meet Adrian Satori was, for Bethel, like being introduced
to the Archangel Uriel at a cocktail party; Satori who had
shepherded Molnar and Pirandello in New York, who had
reintroduced Chekhov, and who was reputed to have been so
impertinent to George Bernard Shaw that Shaw had respected him as
a fellow-dictator.</p>

<p>For no clear reason Bethel had expected the great Satori to be
either gaunt like Jerome O'Toole and Sol Gadto, or plump and
pixie like Roscoe Valentine. But, gaping at him, she was
overwhelmed to find that he looked like a pipe smoker, a golfer
and a commuter. He shook her hand with a paw like a boxer's.</p>

<p>'Come join us, Bethel,' he said, a dryly as though he were
ordering ginger ale. 'You may have some interesting new form of
insanity that hasn't occurred to us yet.'</p>

<p>He was looking at her with bold dark Mediterranean eyes. She
felt that he already knew her better than Andy did, and liked her
more.</p>

<p>The living-room of Andy's apartment was tall, it was very
tall, it was taller than the great hall of the Grand Central
Terminal, with a studio window on one side so tremendous that it
should have framed a view of the entire range of the Himalayas.
Across the room was a Gothic stone fireplace composed of an
entire castle transported from Normandy. On either side of the
fireplace were couches for giantesses, and somewhere far up in
the smoky heights hung a balcony, with a collection of all the
tapestries in the world dangling over the rail. Apparently there
were a bedroom or two up on this airy, healthful mesa, and a
kitchen and dining-room under it.</p>

<p>The living-room was full of practically everything: brocade-
covered couches, marble-topped tables, harewood glass-topped
tables, Spanish thrones, footstools, a grand piano, or it may
have been two grand pianos, a portable bar displaying whisky,
brandy, gin, Grand Marnier, Benedictine, vodka, arrack and
Chinese rice wine, vulgar typewriter desks, eddies of punched
playscript paper, delightful cardboard models of scenery, half-
unpacked suitcases, typed estimates, lost vanity cases, variorum
editions of <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i> phonograph records, copies
of <i>The Billboard</i> and <i>Variety</i> and <i>Theatre Arts
Monthly,</i> arm-chairs deep as bathtubs... and people. And
the telephone rang without ceasing, in the subsidiary suite
across the hall, and Miss Carpet could be heard being noisily
frigid in answer.</p>

<p>And people. They were plastered over the expensive
furnishings. Tudor Blackwall, wearing a checked grey flannel
vest, dashed up to Bethel glowing, 'Darling, don't worry about
finishing my script. I know where I could get it accepted, but
I'm going out with Andy in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> as Paris.'</p>

<p>Doc Keezer, of Grampion, was there, looking like a well-
contented chicken farmer. He was to play both Montague and Friar
Laurence. Seeing Doc was to Bethel like seeing Sladesbury. And,
considerably less soothingly and home-comingly, Iris Pentire was
on hand, being cryptic to a piano stool.</p>

<p>She was chastely clad in a black loose-woven wool skirt up to
her bosom, a Nile-green chiffon blouse with black sleeves down to
her knuckles, and a patent-leather hat like a newly polished
stove lid. She had already been chosen page to Paris and
understudy to the Nurse and to Lady Montague. She confided to
Bethel that she was so rare a hand at makeup that she could
conceal her extreme youth and beauty and be a hag of a nurse
like&mdash;as she herself put it&mdash;'like nobody's
business'.</p>

<p>The throng made exits and entrances with dizzying swiftness
and meaninglessness. Bethel would not have been surprised to see
Eddie Cantor and President Roosevelt enter, arm in arm, followed
by a milk-white antelope with a starry crown. But through all the
walk-ons persisted the voice of none other than Mahala Vale, very
handsome in a blue suit with a chinchilla fur and a hussar cap,
shrieking at Andy and Satori that <i>she</i> ought to be cast as
Juliet, instead of as Lady Capulet, and that for Mrs. Boyle to
play Juliet was as sensible as to cast Madame Flagstad as Little
Eva.</p>

<p>Boyle? Bethel wondered if this could be Mrs. Lumley Boyle, the
famous, beautiful and shockingly bad-tempered Aurelia Boyle. For
Juliet?</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyle was one of the highly competent English actors who,
after working up a hatred for everything British, including fish
and chips and the royal family, had come over to America chiefly
because they could hate everything in these gangster-infested
jungles even more. She was of the age called 'not so young now'.
Perhaps forty. And she was really distinguished... Bethel felt
that socially she was now going a step even higher than
Uriel.</p>

<p>She begged of Andy, 'You're so busy; when may I come back and
ask about a job&mdash;maybe understudy?' and he clamoured, 'No,
no, no, no&mdash;don't you go, kitten&mdash;you stay&mdash;I need
you', and she sneaked off to the security of a small pale arm-
chair.</p>

<p>While Mahala bravely went right on denouncing her civil
wrongs, and Andy cajoled, and Satori laughed and helped himself
to a Scotch and soda, hundreds of thousands of other people
popped in and, after having a free drink, sloughed away. Sally
Carpet flashed in with telephone messages from press agents and
company managers and juvenile actors who were 'at liberty', and
from agents who had complete assortments of Shakespearian casts
ready to deliver.</p>

<p>Seven feverishly competent young women came in to present the
merits of as many dressmakers and, as it had definitely been
announced that this <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> production was to be
in modern dress, they all brought drawings of Elizabethan
costumes in velvet. There was a rush of dealers in rapiers,
floodlights, cosmetics, printing. There was even a live process
server.</p>

<p>In the House of Merriday, in Sladesbury, to be served with a
summons for an unpaid bill ranked with divorce for adultery or
the use of cocaine. But when Miss Carpet quacked from the door,
'Process server here from Mintz, Dolce &amp; Carr, Mist' Deacon,'
the hero laughed: 'Shoot him in... How are you, comrade? This
the document? Thanks. Have a drink?'</p>

<p>'My... God! You bet I will!' yelled the tipstaff.</p>

<p>And all the while, through all charges and retreats, Mahala's
golden voice pealed on:</p>

<p>Boyle's too old and too conventional. She dates about Beerbohm
Tree. Are you going to have J. Wilkes Booth for Mercutio? Why,
this child Beth Merriday could play Juliet better than that
old&mdash;'</p>

<p>From the door, Miss Carpet jeered, 'Mrs. Lumley Boyle to see
Mr. Deacon.'</p>

<p>'&mdash;devil!' Mahala finished, and looked haughty.</p>

<p>A small, slight woman, all eyes, walked in. They were black
eyes, full of life and anger; like the eyes of Bethel and of
Adrian Satori, only more so. She wore a coat of which you could
never remember anything except that it was old but had once been
very expensive. She stood turning the eyes on Mahala, whose knees
grew feeble and her voice puling as she intoned, 'Oh, how do you
do, Mrs. Boyle? Raw day, isn't it? I've got to be running on,
Andy&mdash;Mr. Satori&mdash;Bethel. See you all soon. That's a
wonderful picture of you in <i>Stage,</i> Mrs. Boyle. Good-bye,
all&mdash;goo-oo-ood-bye!'</p>

<p>Bethel slipped up to Andy to whisper, 'Shall I go now?'</p>

<p>'No, no! Now least of all, dear. Adrian and I need somebody
with sense in these troublous times that are about to occur right
now.'</p>

<p>But Mrs. Boyle didn't really want many things&mdash;what she
did want, she wanted earnestly and eloquently, but they did not
go beyond:</p>

<p>A run-of-the-play contract, whereby she could not be
discharged except for barratry, treason or miscegenation.</p>

<p>Billing&mdash;not at all on her own behalf, but for dear
Andy's sake, to sell the play&mdash;as follows:</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">MRS. LUMLEY BOYLE<br>

The world's most distinguished tragedienne<br>
in<br>
<br>
"ROMEO AND JULIET"<br>
<br>
with Andrew Deacon, Mahala Vale,<br>

Mabel Staghorn, Hugh Challis, and cast<br>

of famous New York and London actors.</p>

<p><br>
Dressing rooms A and B, both, in all theatres&mdash;B for her
maid, her shoes and her dog.</p>

<p>Pullman drawing-room for herself and section for her maid, on
all overnight jumps.</p>

<p>And to be present at all interviews, to tell the
reporters&mdash;since her modesty prevented her doing it
herself&mdash;what Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson had said to
her.</p>

<p>No cuts in any of her speeches, no matter what cuts there
might be in the lines of the groundlings.</p>

<p>Johnnie Walker whisky&mdash;black label, not red, remember,
<i>black</i> label&mdash;provided and paid for by the management,
to be present in all her dressing-rooms, hotel suites and train
drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>But, as she was an old trouper, just an old trouper, just one
of the cast and as democratic as a streetwalker, that was all she
wanted.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Boyle was gone, Andy and Satori stretched in chairs,
their legs thrust out far before them, and were wan and
silent.</p>

<p>Bethel was inspired to bring them whisky-sodas. 'Poor
darling!' she murmured to Andy.</p>

<p>'Oh, bless you, of course I remember now, it's Merriday,' said
Andy.</p>

<p>But he said nothing about a job for her. And she would have
been so willing to go along on the tour, even without Johnnie
Walker, black label.</p>

<p><br>
The designer of sets and costumes was a Mr. William Schnable,
a businesslike person with a red moustache and eight-sided
spectacle lenses. He marched in with a portfolio of scene
drawings. The play was to have a unit set, with Romanesque mock-
plaster portals and a number of balcony, archway and window units
which could be shuffled for quick changes. Bethel wondered why,
in a modern-costume <i>Romeo,</i> they should use the old, bogus,
Shaftesbury Avenue-Italian for the sets, but, unbidden, feeling
that she belonged here now, she brought Mr. Schnable a drink and
handsomely sat back and shut up.</p>

<p>Andy, Satori and Schnable showed that there was life in this
stage venture by immediately falling into a derogatory argument
about costumes. Schnable was for having Romeo wear a contemporary
Italian army officer's uniform. Andy yelled that this would look
like Fascist propaganda. Schnable said that anything else would
look like Communist propaganda. Satori said, with what seemed
like considerable reasonableness, that they were both crazy, and
that Romeo should be the most elegant young clubman that could be
turned out by the best Fifth Avenue tailors, and wear a dinner
jacket and an opera hat for the balcony scene. Andy announced
that he would be double-damned if he'd recite 'Oh that I were a
glove upon that hand, that I might touch that cheek' in a boiled
shirt and a natty gent's bow tie. Romeo was so great an
aristocrat that he could wear whatever he liked. He was going to
wander through the play in grey flannel bags, with a tweed jacket
and a soft shirt; maybe he'd change his tie from act to act, but
he wasn't so sure about even that, and...</p>

<p>And weapons. The three stage maniacs came almost to the use of
weapons themselves as they debated what should be used in place
of rapiers, which would be absurd with modern costumes.
Revolvers&mdash;blackjacks&mdash;brass knuckles&mdash;stray
bottles and brickbats? And then stilettos; yes, Tybalt would kill
Mercutio with a stiletto. But the first fight between Tybalt and
Benvolio should be with plain hearty fists.</p>

<p><br>
They were still denouncing one another at seven o'clock, when
Miss Carpet indicated that she had to go home, that she had had
the telephone calls switched on to Mr. Deacon's suite, and that
there still were three young actors waiting across the hall, to
read for the role of Mercutio.</p>

<p>I've taken a look at them. No good. No good at all. Why don't
you chase 'em away?' said Satori.</p>

<p>'Oh, the poor devils, let's give 'em a chance, anyway,'
insisted Andy. 'Besides! How do you know they're no good, just
glancing at 'em? The psychic Satori! Come on, let's read 'em
now&mdash;Bill Schnable and Bethel and you and I.'</p>

<p>'Oh, please no! It wouldn't be fair for me to listen to them
reading,' Bethel protested.</p>

<p>'You'll have a good fresh point of view,' said Andy. 'You may
beat Adrian and me all hollow. And can't you stay and have dinner
with me?'</p>

<p>'I'd lovetobut,' said Bethel dutifully.</p>

<p>'So you think this batch are no good?' Andy sighed to Satori.
'Tempot, the agent, swore they were all three of 'em better than
Gielgud. We've got to have a Mercutio, right away. Look, Adrian!
I've got a brain wave. Let's see if Zed Wintergeist is engaged.
Know his work?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I directed him in a Shaw festival. He's a clever actor,
lots of power, intelligent, but he's a sea lawyer. He criticizes
everybody and everything. He's a mutineer.'</p>

<p>'I know. I played with him in <i>The Light Goes Out.</i> But
he's not effeminate, and he can act&mdash;anything from King Lear
to David, the Shepherd Boy. I'm going to give him a call, anyway.
Bethel, sweet! Will you please find Wintergeist's
address&mdash;remember him?&mdash;the angelic roughneck that came
out of the rain at Grampion and invited himself to our party? His
address is in my little red book there on the piano&mdash;no, I
guess it's upstairs on the bureau in my room&mdash;no, I think I
saw it last in the phonograph&mdash;well, anyway, darling, find
it and get him on the phone for me, while I bring in the boys for
the reading.'</p>

<p>She did&mdash;chasing the little red book to Miss Carpet's
desk across the hall, and then chasing Zed from his cheap-
sounding address far over in the West Forties to the Tavern
Restaurant to backstage at <i>Pins and Needles</i> to a small
select dinner party of two hundred people in Sol Gadto's one-
room-and-toilet apartment.</p>

<p>Yes. Zed would condescend to come and see Mr. Andrew Deacon.
When? Oh, nineish&mdash;if he was still sober.</p>

<p>Schnable had reasonably escaped, but Andy, Satori, and Bethel
dragged three deep chairs into line, as an audience, tried to
look profound, and listened to three several actors trying in
turn to read the most unreadable lines of Mercutio.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as you can tell nothing whatever about an actor by
looking at him, and still less by listening to his first reading
of lines, and inasmuch as these two are the only ways of choosing
an actor, it is probable that nobody has ever yet been chosen for
any role in any play.</p>

<p>Bethel and all the Olde Roanoke pilgrims had resented the fact
that so few managers would ever give an unknown the chance to
read, to be heard and seen. 'It's their duty to give every kid
that much chance, anyway,' they had raged. Now she wondered if it
wasn't less cruel to refuse even to see a job hunter than to let
him go on reading, out of courtesy, when you were certain from
the first sentence that he would not do.</p>

<p>She found the whole business of listening to the reading
horrible. Two of the young men were too soft&mdash;they made
Mercutio into a teashop proprietress; the third, though he looked
like a young white-browed angel, was too tough. He made Mercutio
into a battling longshoreman.</p>

<p>But to all three of them the three judges listened with glazed
politeness. They were arbiters of life and wages and
glory&mdash;and Bethel didn't like that at all. She suffered with
the defendants, and wanted to help them, and didn't know how.</p>

<p>Through the ordeal by fire, the telephone kept ringing,
relentlessly, contemptuously, and Bethel, cursing the name of
Alexander Graham Bell, took over the answering... Could Mr.
Deacon see a fourteen-year-old prodigy who would make the
greatest Juliet in history? Would Mr. Deacon be interested in
buying, for two hundred dollars, a playbill of Salvini in
<i>Macbeth</i> from a dear old lady with a mortgage? Would Mr.
Deacon see&mdash;right away, this minute&mdash;a dear old friend
of Mr. Deacon's, who hadn't ever exactly met him, but who had
been at Grampion for two weeks, three years ago, and who was now
generously waiting down in the lobby?</p>

<p>In all her life Bethel had never learned so much about
practical perjury.</p>

<p>The young men finished reading. To each of them, in turn, Andy
said with wretched politeness, 'We'll let you know in just a few
days. Will you please leave your name and telephone number with
my secretary, Miss Merriday, here?'</p>

<p>And with equally phony hopefulness and gratitude each of the
three young men bowed out&mdash;condemned again to a death of
dreary waiting.</p>

<p><br>
Satori had gone. Andy seemed not to remember anything about
the promised dinner, and Beth could have used a good dinner just
then. She had not had one for ten days.</p>

<p>Andy and she were going over and over the satin outrageousness
of Mrs. Boyle and the huge demerits and few virtues of the three
candidates, when Zed Wintergeist exploded into the room, without
ringing, except as he was in himself a clamorously ringing
bell.</p>

<p>But he was low to-night. Bethel had remembered him as a
combination of Jed Harris, Orson Welles, Richard Whorf, Jack
London, Tarzan, and Percy Bysshe Shelley, but to-night he was
just a strong young man, broad-shouldered but not very tall, in
need of a comb, sulky and rather pale; a plebeian who was
inconceivable as Mercutio, the cavalier.</p>

<p>'Hello, Andy,' he croaked. He stared at Bethel, scratched his
chin, then snapped his fingers at her, infuriatingly, and
shouted, 'Wait&mdash;-wait, I tell you! Don't prompt me!'</p>

<p>Indignantly, 'I don't intend to.'</p>

<p>'Hush! Oh, I've got it, Grampion. The nosy character in
<i>Stage Door.</i> Beth Merriday! Greetings, pet... What can I
do for you, Andy?'</p>

<p>'I'm organizing a <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> company&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why not <i>Uncle Tomeo's Cabin?'</i></p>

<p>'I wouldn't mind... We're going on the road for I don't
know how long, and then come into New York if we're any good. I
think you might possibly do Mercutio, if you're interested.'</p>

<p>'I'm not. <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> was a good play
once&mdash;hell-raising youth, cockeyed, funny, romantic, swell.
Now it belongs with these knitting shops you see in old fishing
shacks all along the New England coast. It's pure and noble and
phony.'</p>

<p>'But we're going to do it in modern dress&mdash;first time
Romeo's ever been done that way, far as we can find out. That
ought to be experimental enough for even you, Zed.'</p>

<p>'Look here. I don't think a play's necessarily good because
it's experimental. Maybe I did once&mdash;two years ago&mdash;two
thousand years ago. Not now. Any provincial Little Theatre that's
run as an adjunct to the golf club, and that plays <i>Liliom</i>
in front of a muslin cyc, does more experimentation in six months
than the whole Abbey Theatre in six years. Still... It
<i>could</i> be interesting. Who's directing?'</p>

<p>'Satori.'</p>

<p>'Mm. He knows his business. He's even heard of Lope de Vega
and of jackknife stages. Of course he's completely cynical and
dishonest.'</p>

<p>Bethel was foaming with indignation. This creature Zed, who
had crawled out of the woodpile, to pick and chatter at the Sun
God's proffered gift!</p>

<p>Andy was gentle as he hinted, 'There may be a lot to what you
say, Zed. What are you doing?'</p>

<p>'Starving.'</p>

<p>'No plans?'</p>

<p>'Same answer: starving! I was out on the road for two whole
weeks with that awful flop, <i>The Soul Clinic.</i> We didn't
even bring it into town. But I did well financially. Two hundred
and fifty a week! Two-fifty for two weeks makes five hundred
bucks, and five hundred bucks divided by fifty gives me ten
dollars a week for the whole year round, and you can live on
that&mdash;in fact you can live on even less than that, in jail,
I suppose&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Zed!'</p>

<p>'Huh?'</p>

<p>'You know you're coming with us! Make Mercutio contemporary.
He's a good deal like you, anyway&mdash;crazy, poetic and bad-
tempered.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You know you're going to do it, Zed, if you can get enough
salary out of me, so why waste time in all this unpaid
performing? Mercutio in uniform&mdash;no illusions about
immortality&mdash;sore because he's going to die. Heh?'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Zed.</p>

<p>Andy took him into the entryway to whisper about
salary&mdash;that was artistico-commercial etiquette, not to talk
openly about money&mdash;and Zed returned to shake Bethel's hand
and shout, 'Good! Let's go! Streamlined Shakespeare with
gyroscopic control! See you on the stage, pet.'</p>

<p>Bethel painfully did not tell him that she wasn't of the
company at all.</p>

<p>She was cross with Andy, though she felt petty in view of the
fact that she had seen him patting two or three banknotes into
Zed's gritty hand.</p>

<p><br>
It was ten by the rock-crystal electric clock on the balcony
railing. Andy, spreadeagled on a couch beside the fireplace,
wailed, 'I'm completely exhausted', and in a completely
unexhausted voice started what promised to be an hour's
commentary:</p>

<p>'I'm glad we've got Zed. If Adrian will just beat him to death
at the first rehearsal&mdash;'</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a very small voice.</p>

<p>'Please?'</p>

<p>'What is it, darling?'</p>

<p>'Dinner?'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'Please? Dinner?'</p>

<p>'My Lord, what a sarcophagus I am, what a zany, what a gaby,
what a doodle, what a dizzard, what a hoddy-doddy, what a tom-
noddy, what a dunderpate, what a jobber-nowl, what a gowk! I
didn't have lunch till four. I forgot people do get hungry. My
poor drowned kitten! You shall have champagne and caviare and the
sound of flutes.'</p>

<p>She did, too&mdash;the flutes provided by the electric
phonograph. He even cut off the telephone and, though once every
quarter-hour a page would knock with a sheaf of telephone
memoranda, they dined in almost matrimonial peace and
drowsiness.</p>

<p>With a script of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> by his plate, Andy
droned about cuts for their acting version. He seemed to take her
as his equal&mdash;his sister, his old trouping
companion&mdash;she who was wondering if by direct interposition
of Heaven she might get a chance to broadcast two lines four
weeks from now as an Apache squaw in the 'St. Clair of San
Antone' radio serial.</p>

<p>Andy was happily fussing. 'In his Globe Theatre version,
Thomas Wood Stevens cuts out Romeo's "They pray, grant thou lest
faith turn to despair". That spoils the sestet. That first duet
of Romeo and Juliet's a sonnet, you know.... Oh, you
<i>didn't?</i> Well, neither did I, till yesterday. Well, what do
you think, darling? I value your judgment so much&mdash;'</p>

<p>'So much that&mdash;Look, Andy, please! I guess I've got to be
a bold wench. You know&mdash;like Juliet. I want a job. Won't you
please give me a reading, too? For anything from the Prince to
the wardrobe mistress!'</p>

<p>'Darling! I'm so ashamed! As a matter of fact I was going to
talk with you about that, but it slipped my mind, what with the
telephone calls from classmates and creditors and cousins and all
the nasty words beginning with C. I thought last summer that you
were the only student that had much possibility. You need
training. But then, so do I, and we'll hope to get it, on one-
night stands with Romeo and friends. The play's mostly cast, now
that we've got Zed: there's only Benvolio, and a triple of the
Apothecary and Sampson and Second Watchman for some poor
overworked ham, and Juliet's understudy&mdash;who'll also play
Mercutio's page. I've read about a dozen ravishing young maidens
for that last part, but I haven't decided and&mdash;Yes. Read
Juliet. And you better be good!'</p>

<p>The waiter had taken out the table. The room, in the thirty-
seventh story of the Hotel Picardy Tower, was quiet. Andy thrust
the Romeo script into her nervous hands, switched on an electric
hearth fire vastly more real than clumsily burning wood, and
flopped out on the couch in beefy elegance.</p>

<p>She got herself a small coffee table and a straight chair,
laid out the script, leaned over it with her cheeks in her hands
and began to read. She became fairly calm. This was not a manager
considering her for a job; it was her friend, almost her
worshipped idol, Andy Deacon.</p>

<p>She was calm enough to forget him entirely as she read, 'O
gentle Romeo, if thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully'. Her
reading had no particular 'modernity', no discernible link with
Freud and Adler. It was as old as cypress groves and little
rivers and the young moon, and if there was anything contemporary
about it, for contribution to the Deacon Theatrical Experiment,
it was that to her, just now, Romeo was not smouldered in an
antique tomb, but alive and here, ducally lolling on the couch,
his eyes (she peeped to see) tight-closed in the closeness of his
attention&mdash;</p>

<p>And she realized that he had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>She was not angry long. Asleep, his face was so youthful, so
weary. She sighed for herself and her lost opportunity, and then
she sighed for him. 'Poor Andy! Poor dear!' She softly drew a
cover over him, tiptoed to find her hat and jacket, and tiptoed
out into the hotel corridor, crying.</p>

<p><br>
The telephone by her bed terrified her out of sleep. She was
entirely convinced that she had murdered someone and that this
was the police after her. Her breath coming harshly, she turned
on the light and saw her little old bedside clock. It was three
o'clock.</p>

<p>'Y-yes?' she said quaveringly, into the hateful black maw of
the telephone.</p>

<p>It was Andy&mdash;blast him! And he sounded as fresh and busy
as at noon.</p>

<p>'Beth? You thought I fell asleep?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I did sort of think so.'</p>

<p>('You know you fell asleep, you producer, you capitalist, you
face-grinder, you spats-wearer.')</p>

<p>'Maybe I did. I'd been going hard since seven in the
morning&mdash;or anyway since eight or eight-thirty. But I heard
enough of your reading before I popped off. If I remember
rightly, you have good legs, haven't you?'</p>

<p><i>'What?'</i></p>

<p>'You heard me! As Mercutio's page, you have to wear
tights.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I have!'</p>

<p>'All right. You're elected. You understudy Juliet and say the
prologue and play the page.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Andy!'</p>

<p>'You get forty a week, Equity minimum. Okay?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, quite okay!'</p>

<p>'You're not an Equity member yet.'</p>

<p>'No, I couldn't join till I had a producer's contract.'</p>

<p>'Come around to the Picardy sometime this afternoon and I'll
give you a contract. Rehearsals start Monday, October thirty-
first, five days from now. We open in Belluca, Indiana, for a
week's run, on November 28th. Look, Beth, what do you think of
keeping the two pages in tights, as I said? It don't jibe with
the modern costumes, but then, we haven't got anything
corresponding to a gent's private page to-day anyway. I've been
thinking about it&mdash;I tried to get Adrian and Bill Schnable
on the phone just now to talk it over, but the dirty dogs have
both cut off their telephones for the night, fine theatrical men
<i>they</i> are, sleeping like commuters, and&mdash;what do you
think?'</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later they were still talking, with Bethel
pleased to believe that she could keep her voice steady and
practical.</p>

<p>She did not go back to sleep. She read an act of <i>Romeo and
Juliet&mdash;</i>sitting up in bed, solemnly sucking a candy bar,
looking about ten years old in her pink-and-white knitted bed
jacket. At dawn she had a shower, dressed, slipped through the
hotel corridor, while the aged male night clerk frowned. She had
coffee and corn flakes at the counter&mdash;of pine scrubbed down
till the knots and the grain stood out like a relief map&mdash;of
an old, cheap restaurant that was lined with pressed tin, so that
she felt as if she were cooped in an old tin packing case.</p>

<p>As she sipped the coffee, which managed to be at once weak and
bitter, she was still hotly reading <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

<p class="first">FOR five days of waiting before rehearsals,
Andy's apartment was her home, her temple. He seemed to like
having her about; occasionally he kissed her cheek, though in an
entirely absent-minded way and usually during a discussion,
explosively carried on with from two to a dozen persons, as to
whether Romeo, the blighter, should ever carry a tennis
racket.</p>

<p>Regularly he insisted that she stay for lunch and dinner, at
which you met a cross section of New York, London and Central
Europe, none of them particularly invited to stay but none of
them ever disinvited.</p>

<p>With no very definite arrangement, she became assistant
secretary to Miss Sally Carpet, and by a judicious combination of
her small shorthand and her large memory, she was able to take
fifty letters a day&mdash;most of which began, 'Dear Joe, When I
arrive in Palace City with my show&mdash;oh hell, Beth, never
mind; I'll phone him, long-distance, this evening.'</p>

<p>Miss Carpet accompanied her when, with the grandeur of a real
theatrical contract in her pocket, she went to join the Actors'
Equity Association... The secretary at Equity seemed perfectly
calm about it.</p>

<p>The apartment became hourly more disordered and insane. On the
grand piano was a heap of scenery sketches, letters, script
pages, theatrical pages torn out of newspapers, and proofs of
advertisements. At any moment you saw Andy emerging from his
bedroom in a maroon dressing-gown over crimson silk pyjamas; Zed
Wintergeist sitting up on the rail of the balcony, legs dangling
over the abyss, eating two ice-cream cones in succession; a
completely strange man in morning coat and striped trousers,
sitting vacantly hour on hour, holding his derby hat and
seemingly having no purpose in life except to hold derbies; and
Adrian Satori asleep five feet away from a poker game conducted
by Andy, Zed, Tudor, Mahala and the stage manager&mdash;a
competent standard-sized person named Nathan Eldred.</p>

<p>There were long conferences with a professor from Swarthmore,
changing the names of Shakespeare's weapons, so that Benvolio's
'put up thy sword' became 'put down your fists', and old Capulet
cried not for his 'long sword' but for his 'oak stick'. During
these solemnities Bethel and her typewriter retreated farther and
farther, until one afternoon she quite happily put in two hours
typing with the machine resting on a chair up in Andy's bathroom,
while Iris Pentire was being helpful by sitting on the edge of
the bathtub and repowdering her nose.</p>

<p>Iris was not there so often, but her ways were simple and
pleasing; she rather hoped to lure Andy away from Mahala, and she
crisply intended to win Zed Wintergeist. And to Bethel's innocent
astonishment, that hard-minded image breaker was easily beguiled
by Iris's faint wise smile. Whenever Zed had denounced Andy for
producing merely another pretty-pretty version of Romeo, he
looked in relief to Iris's cool magic and invited her out for a
drink.</p>

<p>But on Andy, Iris's designs were idiotic. Mahala had claimed
him again. She paraded him, in chains of taffy, before all the
new audience&mdash;Satori and Schnable and Zed and Mrs.
Boyle&mdash;as her very own. So far as Bethel could tell, Andy
was never so incautious as to mutter anything to Mahala about the
gallows march to the altar. He merely said to Mahala that she was
a greater actress than Rejane, more beautiful than Diana Manners,
and that it was a shame for her to spoil such incomparably
beautiful slim hands with crimson nails like lobster claws. But
Mahala incessantly patted him, took his arm, smiled at him
apropos of his observation that the weather was colder to-day,
hummed at him, looked up at him, looked up at him&mdash;</p>

<p>Bethel sighed, 'That female floorwalker will capture Andy, and
Iris will seduce Zed&mdash;not such a complicated campaign, I'm
beginning to think&mdash;and even if Mrs. Boyle falls
dead&mdash;I hope it won't be serious, but I hope it will be
soon&mdash;and I play Juliet, I'll still be left with only Tudor
Blackwall and Doc Keezer for beaux. Oh, this going to be a
crusade of mud and glory.'</p>

<p><br>
She watched the end of the casting. The last stroke was an
error. Andy was so sick of rejecting applicants, of condemning
them to starvation again, that when Mr. Wyndham Nooks proved, in
reading the three parts of Apothecary, Sampson and First
Watchman, that at least he could pronounce the English language,
Andy sighed, ignored Adrian Satori's wildly frowning disapproval
and blurted, 'All right, Mr. Nooks, you can have the part, if
you'll take fifty a week. Okay? Go in and see my secretary, Miss
Carpet, about your contract.'</p>

<p>Before midnight, well berated by Satori, he was groaning, 'Oh,
I know it. I was tired. My foot slipped. I've gone and wished a
real ham on to the company. Well, that may be a good
thing&mdash;the rest of us saved souls will have somebody besides
Mrs. Boyle to hate.'</p>

<p>Mr. Wyndham Nooks was portly, basso, slow and sentimental, and
he quoted poetry&mdash;preferably Milton and Eddie Guest&mdash;in
answer to a request for a match. As a stripling, in Tennessee, he
had been a Fundamentalist Baptist preacher. There were two
schools of thought as to why he had suddenly left this high
calling.</p>

<p>He claimed to be sixty; he had acted, or enacted acting, for
thirty-five years. He had been in medicine shows, in Tom shows,
in pick-up companies playing Shakespeare and Dumas through the
Southwest; he had been drunk with some of the richest cowmen in
Oklahoma and in their homes had recited 'Gunga Din'. He had
starved after his first venture to New York, but then had fallen
into a good line of business doing congressmen and pompous
clergymen&mdash;though he never did quite understand why
audiences laughed so much when he delivered sentiments which he
felt to be elegant and noble.</p>

<p>There was a whole gallery of people new to Bethel, and now
very important to her, in the Romeo cast:</p>

<p>Young Douglas Fry, from the University of Pennsylvania; slim,
colourless, capable. He was assistant stage manager and played
Abraham, Friar John and the Second Watchman; he wanted eventually
to be a director.</p>

<p>Lyle Johnson, who was to play Balthasar in a chauffeur's
uniform, and any number of Torch-bearers and Citizens of Verona
in between. He was a good actor, he was a drunken rowdy after
eleven-thirty p.m., he looked like a loose farmhand off-stage,
but on-stage looked like precisely whatever character he was
ordered to portray. He would end in jail or in Hollywood.</p>

<p>Hugh Challis, that stately, kindly old Lambs' Club Englishman
who dealt generously in charm. He was Capulet, a role which he
had first played in the Nottingham at the age of twenty-two.</p>

<p>The Nurse was that sweetly sighing, tenderly patting and
poisonously gossiping old character woman, Miss Mabel
Staghorn.</p>

<p>Lady Montague was Charlotte Levison, who was Jewish and a
Communist, and who resembled all young eighteenth-century English
duchesses depicted against oaks in the deer park. Charlotte had
inherited Communism from her family, as she might have inherited
Catholicism or Quakerism, and she combined with her vague
Marxianism a pious fondness for furs and ruby bracelets and
guinea hen under glass.</p>

<p>Tybalt was Henry W. Purvis, PH.D. in English of the University
of Chicago. Harry Purvis was the hedge scholar, the Friar Tuck,
whom even card-catalogue universities cannot kill out of the
eternal human comedy. For a year (he was thirty now) he had been
master in that select academy for young gentlemen, Hotchkiss. He
was an excellent actor, fresh and vigorous and flexible; and on
holidays and after hours, he was a much worse drunk, more sodden
and suicidal, than Lyle Johnson. His real initials were H. W. L.,
but he was trying to lose the L.</p>

<p>Benvolio was the Canadian actor, Geoffrey Hoy&mdash;he was
mostly clothes and smile. Escalus, Prince of Verona, was Victor
Swenson, who, though he was broad-shouldered and Viking-maned,
had followed the too-common American transition from wheat farm
to decadence in one generation. Peter was Antonio Murphy, a
dolorous comedian surly about taking direction.</p>

<p>There were two youngsters: Vera Cross, who understudied Lady
Capulet, and Tom Wherry, who understudied all the younger men
principals; and both of whom appeared as Citizens of Verona,
along with almost everybody in the cast. There was so much
doubling that Doc Keezer (Montague-Laurence) said (and
frequently) 'when you came offstage, you met yourself just
leaving your dressing-room. Still, that's nothing. Why, when I
was playing with Lincoln J. Carter, I did six different
characters and an off-stage pistol shot.'</p>

<p>Of the permanent crew of three heads of mechanical
departments, carried with the company to direct local crews of
stagehands&mdash;carpenter, electrician and props&mdash;Bethel
did not know or think for weeks yet, but she was to come to know
them as a company of uncles, protective and wise. But Tertius
Tully, the company manager, who was as thin and salty and Yankee
as a dried codfish, was to be her Chief Uncle.</p>

<p><br>
This was her family, her tribe, her temple, her vagrant home.
In it she still loved but almost forgot her earlier homes: her
parents, Charley Hatch, Alva Prindle, college and Fletcher Hewitt
... that innkeeper. She was a nun now, a probationer nun, and
she was well content.</p>

<p>This was good enough!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

<p class="first">THEIR first rehearsal, when they read through
their parts aloud, was at the historic Gotham Theatre, but it was
not on the stage, which still shone from the presences of Mrs.
Fiske and Maude Adams and John Drew and Nat Goodwin. The bones of
a recent brief theatrical misfortune were being carted away from
the stage; in the lounge, the management was trying to make old
red-plush chairs into new red-plush chairs; and the lobby was
being painted. And so the auspicious first rehearsal of <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i> was held in the Ladies' Room.</p>

<p>It was quite a nice Ladies' Room, with a dressing-table, a
wide mirror edged with designs in frosted glass, six refined pink
washbowls and a dozen gilt chairs, which were taken by the older
troupers. Mrs. Boyle pre-empted two of them, one for her fur,
while the others sat on the floor.</p>

<p>As Mercutio's page and as understudy to Juliet, Bethel had
nothing to read, in among the organ notes of Romeo and Lord
Capulet and the Prince; but as Prologue, she had a whole sonnet,
at the beginning of the first act, and she sang it out in the
fresh voice of an eager young girl who loved 'the traffic of our
stage with the pair of star-crossed lovers'.</p>

<p>She thought that Adrian Satori, directing, nodded a blessing.
But afterwards it seemed to her that everyone else had read so
much more richly: Andy the soul of youthful love, Zed Wintergeist
so boldly gay a Mercutio, Harry Purvis a swift blade as Tybalt,
Hugh Challis sputtering pomp as Capulet, and Mrs. Boyle not
forty-four but an eternal twenty.</p>

<p>(Bethel was quarrelling with Shakespeare and the Nurse for
their lie that Juliet was fourteen. Why, she herself, was twenty-
two, and it looked as though that enterprising young sprout
Juliet had been around at least as much as she.)</p>

<p>When the reading was done, Mr. Wyndham Nooks encompassed
Bethel like a fog blowing from a distillery and boomed, 'It's a
shame to think of a lovely child like you having to open the play
with the prologue. It will be beyond your powers. You'll blow,
sure as hell! Of course I have almost more than I can carry
already, with three bits, but I'll inform our good friend Deacon
that for the good of the show, I can take on Prologue too.'</p>

<p>'You'll get those lines over my dead body!' snarled the young
actress who once had been our gentle little Bethel.</p>

<p><br>
The rehearsals wandered from the Ladies' Room up to the stage
of the Gotham, then to a hall where Romeo, supposed to be gazing
down the long tessellated ballroom at the distant beloved, was
actually looking into Satori's yawns, three feet away. But they
settled down for two weeks on the stage of that competent new
theatre, the Prince Regent, not occupied just now by a play.
Bethel felt happily that she had lived here all her days.</p>

<p>No first night, with chandeliers and Jerome Kern overture and
furs and white shirt fronts and sparkling applause, could be more
enchanting than the undressed stage, illuminated only by a work-
light on a standard, with shadowy hints of the tall brick back
wall, the bars of steam pipes, dusty stacks of old flats leaning
against the wall, the electric switchboard and, mysterious above
all, the upward-reaching darknesses of the fly loft. Against this
quiet obscurity the actors, in shirt sleeves or old sweaters or
too jaunty tweeds, moved back and forth, stammering their lines,
repeating them, stopping to read not-quite-learned lines from the
typed parts which they held up to their faces with one hand while
the other hand made vague wild blind motions of wielding a
club&mdash;or a girl.</p>

<p>Satori lounged over a kitchen table, making minute delicate
notes on his script, and Nathan Eldred, the stage manager, in
another chair discreetly drawn two feet farther back, prompted
from his own script... No audience, but darkness and
strangeness, and in the midst of it, the work-light, and the
moving actors beginning, gesture by gesture and word by beautiful
word, to evoke the passion in Verona.</p>

<p>That was the stage for Bethel Merriday.</p>

<p><br>
Only a few times did Satori run through with her the prologue
to the first act&mdash;the second-act prologue was cut out; and
as Mercutio's page, she was on but a few minutes. Her real task,
as understudy for Juliet, was to sit down in the auditorium,
unmoving, like a solemn little owl, concentrated on everything
that Mrs. Boyle did&mdash;every pronunciation of a musical line,
every slightest movement of intense eyes, tender lips, eagerly
graceful arms.</p>

<p>If she wanted to be up there with the others on the stage, she
comforted herself with the assurance that soon she would be. In
her next show <i>she</i> would have an understudy of her
own&mdash;yes, and she'd treat her in a lot friendlier way than
she was treated by Mrs. Boyle, whose most ardent attention was to
look at her as though she had got in here by mistake and mutter
'Oh!'</p>

<p>Bethel understood better now the improbable stories of
understudies who prayed that their principals would fall through
a trap door.</p>

<p>It was a strain, sitting paralysed and ignored from ten to one
and from two till six, particularly when the hour of six meant,
to Mr. Satori, in scorn of Equity rules, seven-thirty or nine-
thirty or eleven. Yet she rejoiced in this long, precise, four-
week rehearsal as against the panic sketchiness of five-day
rehearsals in summer stock.</p>

<p>And she was very cross with Iris Pentire&mdash;it didn't take
much to make her cross with Iris&mdash;for sneaking away from her
observation post as understudy to both the Nurse and Lady Capulet
for a smoke in the lobby, or backstage to whisper glisteningly to
Zed Wintergeist.</p>

<p><br>
Zed was mutinous and critical from the first. Bethel was a
little surprised when, after the five-day probation period before
contracts were made permanent, Andy and Satori still kept him in
the cast.</p>

<p>He wanted to make the articulation of the lines as prosaic and
contemporary as the costumes; he wanted, he said, to exchange the
gilt decorations of a fairy tale for the beauty of human
emotions. Andy read Romeo, he said, like an elocutionist at
Chautauqua.</p>

<p>In one of the hysterical blow-ups at rehearsal which are a
proof that the play is progressing healthily, Zed denounced Andy
and Andy denounced Satori, and in compromise Zed was allowed to
deliver his lines as though a laughing, aching human being were
talking, while Andy went on winging the empyrean.... Even
young Bethel could see that the contrast was shocking, but Satori
was dictator, as apparently a director must be.</p>

<p>After rehearsal hours, Andrew Deacon was the producer, with
all the privilege of coaxing his friends to put money into the
venture, and the imperial right to decide whether they should
presently be playing three nights in Bonanza City, or one night
each in Coyote Crossing, Cathay and Carlsbad. But during
rehearsals, Satori told Andy and Zed&mdash;and Mrs. Boyle and
Bethel&mdash;indiscriminately that they were stinking, and Andy
took it more gratefully than anybody else in the company.</p>

<p>If there were skirmishes and barricades, there were no feuds
or cliques in the company&mdash;yet. Everybody said that they
were going to have a 'hit'. These modern clothes were making the
play not an antique but a love story almost as good as one out of
Hollywood. The married men of the cast, Hugh Challis, Geoffrey
Hoy, Antonio Murphy, Wyndham Nooks, Nathan Eldred, the stage
manager, and Tertius Tully, the company manager, muttered to one
another that, after the last lean year, they would now be able to
'send home enough for the little woman and the dear little ones
to go out and get soused every Saturday night, like
gentlemen'.</p>

<p>Zed's nobly expanding grouch extended to Mr. Schnable's
scenery as much as to the speech.</p>

<p>Like Bethel, he did not see why a contemporary Romeo should be
played in a mock Lombard palace. With Douglas Fry, the small
industrious assistant stage manager, Zed sketched a permanent set
suggesting modern Italy; a huddle of yellow plaster walls with
red-tiled roofs and a medieval tower, the terrace of Lord
Capulet's modern villa, strung with coloured electric bulbs for
dancing, with the door of Laurence's cell below the terrace, and
behind all, the skeleton of a wireless tower.</p>

<p>They brought in their sketches&mdash;two enthusiastic young
men who loved the stage so much they were willing to be damned
for their impudence&mdash;and Mr. Schnable, the designer, a
middle-aged man who didn't love anything in particular, promptly
damned them. Andy said mildly, Yes, well, it certainly was an
interesting sketch, but afraid he'd spent all the money on
scenery he could afford to....</p>

<p>Zed returned this benignity with a glare.</p>

<p><br>
That newly fledged trouper, Bethel, was surprised that Mahala
took direction almost as humbly as Andy. She began to respect
Mahala as purely as she disliked her.</p>

<p>Mahala seemed mobilized now to capture Andy complete. The
border-incident came from Joan Hinterwald, and it was Bethel who
answered the call when Joan rang up.</p>

<p>Bethel summoned Andy to the telephone, and she couldn't help
overhearing him&mdash;well, she <i>didn't</i> help it. He
sputtered, 'No, honestly, Joan, it's impossible. I can't leave.
We're rehearsing... What?... Serious? Of course it's
serious! What do you think I'm doing? Playing at playing?...
All right; <i>be</i> sore then.'</p>

<p>Bethel saw him stalk back on the stage and ten minutes later
sit down with Mahala. He must have murmured to her something of
his troubles, for Mahala patted his arm sympathetically. Bethel
sighed.</p>

<p>After that day Mahala was cockier than ever. She tore through
the Lady Capulet role like a racing driver, and she had the cheek
to say to Mrs. Boyle (twenty-six being lofty to forty-four), 'I
wonder if any of the audiences will get the humour of my playing
your mother?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps it isn't humorous, my dear,' purred Mrs. Boyle.</p>

<p><br>
The two pages, Bethel and Iris, were not to wear tights and
ruffles, but dreary military-school-cadet uniforms. Bethel was
simultaneously glad that she would not have to be so immodest as
to show her pretty legs in public, and sorry that she was not
going to be more attractive. As to the conduct of their two
minutes parts, Iris and she fell out.</p>

<p>Iris intended to be as dainty and flirtatious in grey trousers
as in chiffon.</p>

<p>'Of course! You don't want to miss being feminine, not with
Zed and Douglas and Lyle and Tom Wherry around!' Bethel was
guilty of remarking.</p>

<p>'And you an Equity member less than two weeks,' sighed
Iris.</p>

<p>'I don't see what that's got to do with it!' But this
preposterous attack confused Bethel, and she ended, without much
conviction: 'I'm going to be as sturdy a young scrapper as I
can.'</p>

<p>'All right, dearie; don't tell me about it; tell Satori,'
mused Iris.</p>

<p>Never had Bethel been so put in the wrong, never had she so
inexcusably put herself in the wrong. It didn't comfort her much
to have Iris and Zed go off to lunch arm in arm. She was
privately deciding that since Andy was apparently lost forever in
the warm ardours of Mahala, like a bumblebee enveloped in the
vegetable horrors of the Venus flytrap, she would better think
seriously about Zed.</p>

<p>Then was horrified to discover that she could take Zed very
seriously indeed. She could admire his noisy courage; she could
be tickled by his ever-changing monkey face.</p>

<p>But this was treachery! she accused herself, and her spirit
sat down again before the kindly shrine of Andy.</p>

<p>Of the constant line changes compelled by the modern setting,
none produced a better battle than Romeo's order to Balthasar:
'And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.' Andy was all for
rendering it, 'Fill up the car with gas; I'll leave to-night'.
Zed (whom no one had consulted) agreed profanely. Satori insisted
that this was a trifle too post-Elizabethan. 'You don't
absolutely <i>have</i> to have the apothecary sell Romeo a drum
of carbon monoxide to kill himself with, you know. Let's make the
speech, "Have the car ready; I will hence to-night." That's good
enough&mdash;or bad enough.'</p>

<p>It was Bethel who most profited by all the violences done to
Shakespeare's words.</p>

<p>Iris had boasted though it might be Bethel who understudied
Juliet, she had no lines on the stage except the 'regular little
college-girl speech' of the prologue, while Iris, as Paris's
page, had four whole lines and a whistle.</p>

<p>But Satori and Andy condensed the end of the play. In the new
version, after Juliet's death, in a light that rose to earliest
dawn, cloaked figures that might have been ghosts moved slowly on
stage, and the curtain came down after a speech combined from the
last lines of Capulet, Montague and the Prince:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

Capulet! Montague!<br>

See what a scourge is laid upon your hate!<br>

But I will raise her statue in pure gold,<br>

That whiles Verona by that name is known,<br> There shall no
figure at such rate be set<br>

As that of true and faithful Juliet,<br>

And rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie,<br>

Poor sacrifices of this enmity.<br>

A glooming peace this morning with it brings;<br>

The sun for sorrow will not show his head.<br>

Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:<br>

For never was a story of more woe<br>

Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</p>

<br>

<p>This speech, Victor Swenson, as Prince Escalus, assumed would
be his own, while old Nooks pointed out that it would go very
nicely indeed with the role of First Watchman. But Andy and
Satori, to universal astonishment and considerably less than
universal rejoicing, gave it to Bethel, as newly created
Epilogue.</p>

<p>And she was to have a lovely new white silk robe and a gold
laurel-crown, a combination of Elizabethan and Contemporary, in
which to say both prologue and epilogue, and Iris was stunned and
despairing, until Zed remarked that the costume looked like
Memorial Day Services at the James A. Garfield High School.</p>

<p><br>
She had to cue Mabel Staghorn, as the Nurse. She had to cue
Mahala. Much worse, she had to get Iris to cue her, as Juliet.
She had her role comma perfect before Mahala had learned half of
hers. But that wasn't enough. Maggie Sample had told her that you
don't really know a role until it's so deep in your unconscious
that you aren't aware of saying the lines at all. So she chased
Iris from auditorium to hidden dressing-rooms to the prop room
and cornered her, and thrust the part at her, and demanded,
'Here, I want to be cued. You know I'm all ready to cue you,
whenever you say the word.'</p>

<p>'Oh, what's the hurry? We're only understudies. Wait till I
get a real role,' sighed Iris.</p>

<p><br>
Satori had a theory that present-day audiences find
Shakespeare dull because the productions are paced like a
funeral. He yielded to Andy and kept Romeo's high poetic lines in
a highfalutin elocution, but he drove the other actors to such
speed that they went off into the wings and wept. There must not
be a tenth of a second between cue and response; no gazing up to
the wings with an archepiscopal reverence. Yet he was precise
about every detail of action.</p>

<p>Every cross, every slight lifting of the hand, must be fitted
to every other movement like a micrometer gauge, and as to the
exact meanings of lines Satori and Andy were always diving into
the Variorum Shakespeare and coming up, philologically dripping,
with 'Look! Look! In the quartos there's no dash before the "no".
This is Ritsen's punctuation.'</p>

<p><br>
'I see they got some nice Irish variorum on the menu today.
Try some?' said Doc Keezer to Bethel at lunch. He had taken her
to Sardi's, where all the debutantes try to look like actresses,
and all the actresses try to look like&mdash;actresses. Normally
the cast's communal lunch, between spasms of rehearsal, was a
waxed-paper container of coffee and a ham sandwich from the
drugstore, but occasionally Doc Keezer rebelled, and demanded
time for real food.</p>

<p>'All that Shakespearian research stuff is the bunk,' he said.
'It's by no means proven that the best way to play Shakespeare
isn't to do a Marmaduke Montmorency de Booth, with all the dog
you can put on, tights and velvet hats and a lot of rapiers, and
chew the scenery and yell and give everybody a good
time&mdash;and you can get all the fittings second-hand then, and
pick out the most rheumatic old ham at Billy McMoriarty's saloon
for director. However, Beth, this is a theatrical engagement. We
might have to go to work if we didn't have it. How about some
cheese for dessert? When we get out on the road, you'll learn to
take cheese instead of all this ice cream. It keeps your belly
filled, and that's the chief purpose of a trouper, and not no
purple ecstasies, or big notices by the police reporter in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa.'</p>

<p>'I'm going to love trouping,' said Bethel.</p>

<p>'You are, eh? Wait till you have to catch a seven-a.m. train
in Minnesota in January, with the thermometer eighteen below, and
that old north-west wind scooting down the platform and the train
an hour and a half late, and then it comes in with ice on it like
armour, and the heating apparatus gone on the blink.'</p>

<p>'I'll love it, Doc.'</p>

<p>'Yes, you probably will, child. That'll be the one thing
that'll finally tear it&mdash;to have you chattering like a
canary bird at breakfast, when the rest of us have hang-overs and
don't want to be suddenly jarred. You're a nice kid. I couldn't
interest you in a goat farm in Vermont, could I? No? Okay, let's
go back and see how much more of a beating the Bard will
take.'</p>

<p><br>
She was still alone every evening&mdash;her companions of the
day vanished into nonexistence after rehearsals&mdash;but she was
not lonely. She curled on the bed in her room, repeating the
Juliet part aloud; she washed her hair; she went by herself to a
movie, humming such classic epodes as 'Tea for Two', gliding in a
warm, lilac-coloured mist that shut out the November drizzle and
cement pavements and iron gratings. For the first time in her
life she was completely happy.</p>

<p>And once Andy invited her to an evening party at the Picardy,
of which she recalled little except Mahala, in a black evening
frock with a panel of silver from bosom to hem, being maddeningly
gracious and proprietorial, and insisting on pouring out drinks
for large strong men like Harry Purvis and Tony Murphy and Victor
Swenson.</p>

<p>And once Andy took her to dinner at the Twenty-One Club, at
which he appeared at least twice a week for the purpose of
explaining to a circle of professional wits that he never went to
Twenty-One because there were too many professional wits
there.</p>

<p>'Here's the picture you and I have to get, as apprentice
actors, both of us. It's an allegory that Dorothy Gish told me,'
said Andy. 'There was an old vaudeville couple; they'd been on
the stage, mostly in the four-a-day, for thirty years, and they'd
never made over sixty dollars a week between them. They'd done
the same act&mdash;patter with a little Indian-club juggling, and
then go into their dance&mdash;for fifteen years.</p>

<p>'Well, vaudeville is out, for the time being. They're living
in a furnished housekeeping room, and Pop has been working in a
clothes-pressing shop, evenings, to keep going. But they've had
three days in a movie house in Altoona, and they land back in New
York twenty-five dollars to the good. To-night they'll have
chicken, and Pop will be able to buy a new pair of pants for
three-fifty, and that will keep the old coat going another
year.</p>

<p>'It's evening and it's raining, and they carry their own
suitcases from the ferryhouse, but they're cheerful until a
Rolls-Royce limousine comes flying by, near the kerb, and
splashes mud all over them. In the limousine is a handsome, husky
young couple&mdash;furs and top hat, staring straight ahead,
ignoring everybody.</p>

<p>'Pop pulls out his old handkerchief, and wipes the mud off his
wife's skirt, and he points after the expensive couple in the car
and crows, <i>"But they can't act!"</i> There's our gospel,
Beth.'</p>

<p><br>
And once, rather rudely, Zed invited her to dinner at an
Italian restaurant in the East Forties, so far over that it was
practically in Italy, and filled her with fetuccini, and lectured
her as eloquently as Andy.</p>

<p>'This last week, the rehearsals will get pretty hysterical.
Satori will work us all night. Nobody will know his lines.
Everybody will blow up. But that kind of strain you get over,'
said Zed. 'The thing you've got to have the character to
stand&mdash;good, old-fashioned, Scotch-Yankee-Montana word,
"character"; I like it&mdash;is after the show closes, and you go
plumb loco, because month after month you can't get a
job&mdash;you're in swell shape, all ready to go, and they won't
let you up on any stage.'</p>

<p>'I know. I've had just a month and half of it.'</p>

<p>'You've got to be prepared for a year and a half of
it&mdash;ten years. Sitting by a telephone all day, waiting for a
manager to call you.'</p>

<p>'Do you?'</p>

<p>'No, but then I've got a special method. I insult people, and
so they notice me. That takes too much pains and energy for most
people. And then, too, it gets around that I'm a really good
actor, and they need me.'</p>

<p>'Upon my word! What about&mdash;'</p>

<p>'How do you know whether you're a good actress yet or not? How
does anybody know? Don't be a lady. Don't look for insults.'</p>

<p>'Uh&mdash;well&mdash;yes&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The actor and the portrait painter are the only artists that
have to have people out in front. Writers are lucky! A writer can
write even if he's fallen out of an aeroplane on the Sahara
Desert.'</p>

<p>'Write on what?'</p>

<p>'On the sand!'</p>

<p>'That wouldn't last very permanently, would it?'</p>

<p>'What writing does? Even Homer's only lasted three thousand
years, and the human race's been going on for at least two
hundred thousand.'</p>

<p>'Zed! Do you think I'll be able to act?'</p>

<p>'My pet!' 'Pet' was Zed's standard word of endearment, as
'darling' and 'kitten' were Andy's and 'child' was Doc Keezer's.
He would do wonderful, histrionic things with 'pet'; he could
make it insulting, belligerent, comforting or amorous.</p>

<p>'But <i>do</i> you think so?' insisted Bethel.</p>

<p>'I don't know yet. You're certainly not a dumb faker like
Iris&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Then why do you go around with her so much?'</p>

<p>'Because she does what I tell her to, petty! You're not dumb
like her, or phony and pretentious like Mahala, or sweet and
pixie and dull like Mabel Staghorn. You belong more with
Charlotte Levison&mdash;she's a tract-passing evangelical
fundamentalist Marxian, but a tricky actress. Or maybe you even
belong with the big bad Boyle. Or you will, if you ever learn
anything.</p>

<p>'At present you can't even walk across the stage as though you
were really going somewhere and not being dangled on a string by
the director. But&mdash;yes, you have a kind of&mdash;a touch of
strangeness. God knows where you got it! A B.A. from a female
college! But maybe you'll be able to do some conjuring yet, if
you can ever learn to keep your hands from getting tangled up
with your feet when you're pulling the rabbit out of your silver
snood. <i>Bethel!'</i></p>

<p>'Yes?'</p>

<p><i>'Pet!'</i></p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'This show will flop, of course. It won't last ten weeks on
the road.'</p>

<p>'Oh! No! Zed! It will succeed! It's got to! I'll make it!
We'll all make it go. It's the world and all to Andy.'</p>

<p>'But unfortunately Andy isn't anything to the world and all.
He's a nice guy&mdash;and that's a lot of praise from me, because
mostly I don't like these kindhearted, open-faced, upstanding
young men from Yale and Princeton and Dale Carnegie's classes in
oratory. But we haven't got anything. Modern dress? Hell, pants
don't make a show&mdash;even the lack of 'em doesn't.</p>

<p>'It's the emotion, the philosophy, the <i>Stimmung,</i> and
the <i>Stimmung</i> of our production is as old-fashioned as Joe
Jefferson.</p>

<p>'Romeo is biology, that's what he is, not moonshine, and
Shakespeare knew it, the old devil&mdash;having been, like
myself, educated under a hedgerow. Romeo is a decent young snob
who's raving, fighting crazy about a girl who's the first one
he's ever been really in love with. But to Andy and even to Mrs.
Boyle our presentation is merely a prankish pageant to be played
in the glade, under the auspices of the Siddons Society of Sweet
Briar College, and it's all the more prankish to wear herringbone
tweed instead of velvet, so long as all the thoughts are in
velvet. So what have we got? Just another semi-professional road
company of "Abie's Italian Rose". No, pet, I'm sorry; I like to
eat, too, within reason; but we've got a flop on our hands.'</p>

<p>Bethel was desolate; she was full of eager, loyal, imbecile
plans for converting Andy to something which she didn't in the
least understand. She loved Andy for his pathetic plans of an
eager child; she hated Zed for his cynicism; she hated Andy for
his amateurishness; she loved Zed for his integrity; and in
excitement and bewilderment she lapped up spumoni like a cat
lapping cream.</p>

<p>'So,' Zed went on, 'if I'm right, you and I will be back here
in New York by about the end of February. We'll be just a couple
of kids, with no job. Let's get acquainted on this tour. Really
acquainted.'</p>

<p>'You seem to be sufficiently really-acquainted with Iris.'</p>

<p>'Yuh. Too well!'</p>

<p>'You're one of the gweat big men that all of the poor weak
women follow!'</p>

<p>'Pet! Would you mind stopping talking like a fool&mdash;like a
suburban wife flirting with the dentist? Let's get back to
work.'</p>

<p>She was angry and a little curious; not so much as to what his
intentions might be as to whether this bumptious young stroller
took enough trouble with women to have any intentions toward them
at all.</p>

<p><br>
It was a relief to ask cool, pleasant young Douglas Fry his
opinion of their fate.</p>

<p>'Of course the show will succeed!' asserted Douglas. 'Isn't
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> the greatest love story going? Aren't
Americans the most sentimental people in the world? And isn't
this the first time Romeo has been done so people to-day will
identify themselves with it? Why, of course! It'll be a wow!'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, I'm sure it will be a wow,' exulted Bethel.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

<p class="first">THERE were excursions that made Bethel feel
gratifyingly professional: the election of the company's Equity
deputy, when for a quarter-hour they ceased being artists and
vigorously became labour-union members who had jobs and wages to
protect. Wyndham Nooks diaconally offered to serve and to guard
them all like little lambs; so Doc Keezer was elected. As a
junior member of Equity, Bethel had no vote. She just prayed for
Doc's election.</p>

<p>And the first professional photographs: individual ones to be
exhibited in the frames in the theatre lobbies. They were
photographed in a rapid-fire theatrical studio in a shaky old
building over an orangeade stand on that shockingly decayed
Rialto, Broadway.</p>

<p>The photographer, a black-haired young Pole who wore a beret
and a checked business suit, glared at Bethel, announced, 'You've
got a nice, sensitive face for Hollywood, young lady, when you
can get out of this damn-fool stage business', and before she
could protest that she was an Artist, he was yelling at her,
'Look Up! Look down! Now look up here where I'd be saying "Look
at the canary", if you were about two years younger. Swell!
Scram! Next!'</p>

<p>She was rather unausterely pleased when the proofs of her
photographs made her seem alive and exciting, all living dark
eyes, while the pictures of the lovely lily Iris revealed her as
a little washed-out and plebeian. She told herself that she
oughtn't to think things like that... she <i>told</i>
herself.</p>

<p><br>
The last ten days out of the four weeks of rehearsals
accelerated like a car without brakes running down a mountain
road.</p>

<p>For days it did not seem probable that there ever would be a
performance. Half the time the old troupers like Doc Keezer and
Hugh Challis and Mabel Staghorn saved their voices and dismayed
Bethel by stingily talking only to themselves. Sometimes she was
impressed by the dignity and noble pity of the prosaic Doc Keezer
as Friar Laurence.</p>

<p>His whole face seemed larger; his forehead wider; his tranquil
gestures more priestly. Then he would shrink again into peddling
his gestures dully across a counter. Andy was always awake and
romantic. Mrs. Boyle was for an accidental moment, now and then,
transformed into the passionate girl. Her voice was living music,
and an inner glow seemed to make her whole body rosy as in divine
tenderness she cried:</p>

<br>


<p class="verse">'Be but sworn my love,<br>

And I'll no longer be a Capulet.'</p>

<br>

<p>And five minutes later Mrs. Boyle would be breaking the spell,
and infuriating Romeo, by sweetly crooning, 'Oh, Mr. Deacon, I am
so sorry to interrupt but, Mr. Satori, did you say you thought I
ought to lay my hand on the nurse's shoulder just before I say "O
what a beast was I to chide at him", or just afterwards?'</p>

<p>And when even the rock-bound Satori blew up with, 'Oh, for
God's sake, Aurelia, do it just the way you've been doing it ever
since you played it with Charles Kean in 1855!' then Mrs. Boyle
smiled demurely.</p>

<p>Zed Wintergeist referred to Mrs. Boyle as the 'six-minute
egg'.</p>

<p>By sheer torture Satori got old Wyndham Nooks not to say his
line as Sampson, 'I strike quickly, being moved', as though he
were about to be sick. Most of the time most of the cast
floundered and forgot their lines and spoke them like sulky
schoolboys and forgot fifty times over just when they were to
turn and when to walk; and to the anxious Bethel, the whole thing
was a straw pile.</p>

<p>It was on Tuesday afternoon, in the last week of rehearsals,
that the miracle happened, and suddenly they were
playing&mdash;they were not school children doing exercises but
trained actors playing, and then not actors at all, but real
people, suffering, loving, fighting. She cried a little, and she
saw Satori breathe deep, as line came smoothly after line like
water flowing.</p>

<p><br>
Incredibly, the rehearsal time was almost over, and they were
preparing for their journey that would take them out to Iowa,
Kansas, perhaps to Colorado and California, that might last a
year and might end up in New York or Australia&mdash;or in
Palooka Junction.</p>

<p>They were all buying wardrobes and baggage, and all talking
about it. Mahala was going to have a new evening frock of silver
lam&eacute;&mdash;she would be going to elegant parties with
Andy, she sniffed. Iris, at the celebrated 'little dressmaker on
a side street, so cheap, and just as good as Bergdorf', was
having made an evening frock that had a jet black front and tight
long sleeves but, economically, no back at all.</p>

<p>Bethel's father, always so amazingly understanding of things
that he couldn't possibly have understood or imagined, had sent
her a hundred dollars, with a note ending, 'I guess I can get
along without this for a while and you will want to buy trunk
&amp; etc. &amp; be as well dressed as all the other girls in
Show, guess to do that would cost three four hundred, afraid
can't quite afford that but hope enclosed will help a
little'.</p>

<p>She tenderly sent back ten dollars, and spent the rest on
underclothes and a sweater and a trunk. She was suddenly sharply
impatient with the swank of Mahala and Iris. If she bought
anything, it would be out of her savings along the road after she
had paid Sol Gadto for his lessons&mdash;and if the others
sniffed at her shabbiness, why, she'd just have to get along with
being as badly dressed, off-stage, as Mrs. Lumley Boyle!</p>

<p>But she excitedly shopped for a second-hand trunk. She calmly
drove a number of Third Avenue Jewish dealers in such baggage,
dealers esteemed in the profession for their shrewdness and
persistence, to frothing madness by picking at the corners of
wardrobe-trunk drawers and counting the number of clotheshangers
and refusing to be moved by broken-hinged coffers with lovely
flowery chintz lining.</p>

<p>No newly made knight had more satisfaction than did Bethel
when the new old trunk arrived in her room&mdash;necessitating
her standing on the bed when she was dressing&mdash;and she
beamed at its lordly inscription:</p>

<p class="sign">B.M.<br>
N.Y.C.<br>
THEATRE</p>

<p><br>
She read timetables. She looked at maps in the library. She
mugged up on such exotic knowledge as the origin of the names Des
Moines and Milwaukee. And she was somewhat terrified all the
while, because the longest journey she had ever made had been
from Sladesbury to Bar Harbour, by motor car, and she had never
spent a night on a Pullman car in her life&mdash;to her
generation, aeroplanes were more familiar than trains. And she
was sure, up to the moment when their train left for Belluca,
Indiana, that this grown-up company of real actors would never
actually pay her train fare and take her along.</p>

<p><br>
Andy Deacon had a rich cousin, one Romer Ingalls, in the
plumbing-supply-manufacture and Sons of the American Revolution
line in Belluca, and no professional play had opened there for
years. With these two advantages, they were bound to succeed, and
to all of the company, even Doc Keezer and Mrs. Boyle, Belluca
suddenly took on the aspect of Bethlehem.</p>

<p><br>
Rather numbly, as on the morning before execution, Bethel
realized that at seven p.m., this very Saturday, November 26th,
1938, she would be starting, with the company for Belluca. She
packed her trunk and three bags, made sure that her purple lining
pencil and mascara were in her makeup box, paid her final hotel
bill, sent down her baggage, and sat on her bed in the vacated,
horribly empty, horribly quiet and utterly strange room, in a
panic.</p>

<p>Volitionless, dream-walking, she coaxed herself downstairs and
into a taxicab to the Pennsylvania Station.</p>

<p>With a feeling that the flow of passengers would stop and rush
up to her, begging for her autograph, if they knew who she really
was&mdash;i.e., a woman explorer starting for Greenland&mdash;she
gave her suitcase to an unimpressed redcap.</p>

<p>The whole company were surging in circles or standing
patiently at the train gate. She did not know them, for they wore
not the familiar, rather back-attic clothes in which they had
rehearsed, but their best winter overcoats. How familiar she
would become with those overcoats in the next
months!&mdash;Andy's dark grey herringbone, Zed's loose and
cloaklike camel's-hair with the high collar, Iris's vain lilac
garment, with two huge purple buttons on the back of the waist
(and one tiny grease spot, later to spread by parthenogenesis, on
the front hem), Doc Keezer's gloomy, heavy grey worsted which (he
told you) he had bought in Wheeling, West Virginia, for thirty-
two dollars three years ago.</p>

<p>As she recognized them, her timidity was gone in the joy of
this, her family. They were so welcoming, so gay. Everyone's
smile said that they loved her and that they were going forth to
conquer.</p>

<p><br>
But Andy was edging away by himself, walking up and down the
shed, head bent, his hands behind him. Doubtfully she followed
him and begged, 'Anything the matter?'</p>

<p>He held her by both arms and burst out, 'Kitten, I suddenly
feel so responsible, taking all of you out on this gamble, and a
lot of you with dependants&mdash;kids and mothers. Real actors,
not semi-amateurs like me, trusting their whole lives to an
enterprise like this. It scares me! Darling, I want you to kneel
in your berth to-night and pray, "God make me a good actress and
help me to help Andy put this crazy adventure over"!'</p>

<p>For the first time, she was not shy with him. As he held her
shoulders, she put her light hands affectionately about his waist
and cried, 'You've been an angel to all of us. And we do
appreciate it, though I guess we've all been too stupid to thank
you. And we will succeed. We will!'</p>

<p>'Thanks, Beth.' He looked at her with a curious, bright
sensitiveness, unlike his complacent bulk, patted her shoulders
and hurried away to buy mounds of magazines.</p>

<p><br>
The train gate was open. The company were a ship's complement,
shouting farewell to land, anchors aweigh for Ultima Thule, where
summer and winter the golden globes shine on the trees and in the
street lie pieces of eight. Antonio Murphy, the solemnly comic
Peter, was kissing a surprisingly pretty young wife good-bye; so
was Geoffrey Hoy, the Benvolio; Mabel Staghorn was crying on the
shoulder of a thin, painfully reasonable little man; and Wyndham
Nooks kissing the hand of a faded and ageing wife, faded yellow
hair and faded pink cheeks and faded pink summery hat, who had
been his companion in rackety medicine-show days and who looked
at her lion-maned Henry Irving so adoringly, with such
loneliness, that Bethel pinched herself for having ever made fun
of Nooks.</p>

<p>And they all stamped down the stairs and on to the
Pullmans.</p>

<p>They had one and a half Pullmans reserved for them. In the
half-car, the Adults' Car, to which were assigned such nobles as
Hugh Challis, and Mabel Staghorn, Mrs. Boyle had the drawing-
room, which is the sign and privilege of a star; in the other,
the frivolous Young People's Caravan, the drawing-room was
Andy's, but to-night it was shared by Director Satori, who was
going out to Belluca to stay with the show the first week. And on
the whole journey it was jammed less with Andy than with blown
newspapers, the girls of the company, bridge games, Wyndham Nooks
rumbling, portable radios yawping, and everybody's excess
luggage, rubbers and troubles. It was as private and honorific as
the vestibule.</p>

<p>Before the train started, Andy summoned everybody into the
Young People's Car for an announcement. Beth long remembered
those twenty-eight people, plus Sally Carpet, come down to the
train with the final telegrams for Andy, standing thick in the
car aisle, their faces, carven in high planes and shadows by the
car lights, uplifted to Andy as he stood up on a pile of
suitcases and shouted:</p>

<p>'Ladies and gentlemen of the company! We are about to assault
and capture the West. West where the West begins. Where the
handclasps are a little warmer and we hope the box offices are a
little busier.'</p>

<p>Bethel sharply remembered that, however Andy might joke, she,
who had never been more than ten miles west of the Hudson, really
was Going West: California sands and yellow rivers and desert and
the peaks of Colorado; covered wagons, and John Brown riding, and
young men singing on ranches with the moon enormous across the
plains. She was almost dancing as he went on:</p>

<p>'So to start us off on our mission&mdash;of making a fairly
honest living&mdash;I want to tell you that I have just received
a wire from Belluca that we shall go clean on Monday night,
opening night, and that there is a very good chance of our being
sold out for all the rest of the week. We're a hit already, boys
and girls. Skip, Sally; the train's going.'</p>

<p>Everybody cheered. Miss Carpet darted off, to the tune of that
twilight wail, 'All-ll-ll abo-oo-ooard!' from the platform, and
the train was moving.</p>

<p><br>
The car was littered with baggage like the debris of a
hurricane. Bethel was to know the company's belongings as well as
she knew the owners: Doc Keezer's portable radio, canvas-covered
with a band of red and yellow, which he played very softly in his
berth on the long, train-shaking nights when he couldn't sleep;
Mahala's extravagant four bags, in blue morocco so expensive and
so easily scratched that she kept them protected by a variety of
little dog blankets, so that you never could see the fine leather
at all; the two-volume set of Karl Marx which Charlotte Levison
always had with her, in train seat and hotel and dressing-room,
and which she was never seen to read for more than five minutes
at a time; the whole series of plays and books on stage design
which Zed Wintergeist and Douglas Fry did read and trade back and
forth; Henry W. Purvis's private flask, and Henry W. Purvis's
folding pocket chessboard, which he shared with Douglas, Hugh
Challis and Mabel Staghorn; and, most conspicuous, most horrible
of all the impedimenta, Mrs. Lumley Boyle's hell-born and heaven-
hated Pekinese dog, named Pluto.</p>

<p>These objects Bethel came to know better than any piece of
furniture in the house in Sladesbury&mdash;even the ancient
folding card table on which she had done her homework and had
drawn hearts and flowers. At home things did get put away in
closets now and then, while here you stumbled over Mahala's
imperial blue bags, and cracked your shins on them, on the train,
in hotel corridors and in front of her dressing-room, all day
long.</p>

<p><br>
It was a travelling circus; it was an army with paper banners.
There seemed to be no end to the people Bethel met as her new
family. On the train she first really talked with the company
manager and wet nurse, the Yankee Tertius Tully, and first saw
the master carpenter, the electrician and the property man, who
would manage local theatre crews: Gene Doric, Wilson Kinloch, and
Phil Schoenberg. They were all middle-aged, all hopelessly
married, all given toblack sateen shirts. Gene and Phil became
her amiable and loyal friends; Bethel felt more at home with them
than ever with Victor Swenson or Tudor Blackwall.</p>

<p>But Wilson Kinloch proved that a man may be a member of a
labour union, in good standing, and still be rather less than a
saint. Kinloch hated, roughly in this order: Andy's wealth,
Andy's acting, Gene Doric's not altogether guileless habit of
dropping hammers on his (Wilson's) toes, William Green president
of the American Federation of Labour, J. Pierpont Morgan, Zed
Wintergeist's jeering, Iris Pentire's softness, and Pluto, the
dog of Boyle. And he hated them so heartily and industriously
that, before the tour was over, he became rather of a sympathetic
character to a Bethel getting fed up with balconies, moonlight
effects and genius.</p>

<p>She now met first the final members of the excursion: Hilda
Donnersberg, Mrs. Boyle's maid, a wild strained Austrian who was
convinced that everybody but Mrs. Boyle was a fool; and Ernie
Smith, the boy who came along to sell the illustrated programmes
in the lobbies and who loved nothing so much as giving Iris and
Bethel his opinion of the acting of Francine Larrimore and
Katharine Hepburn and Pauline Lord. It seems that all of these
ladies had frequently called him to their dressing-rooms for
technical advice, and had benefited gratifyingly. Miss Larrimore
had said to him&mdash;asserted Ernie&mdash;'I consider you the
smartest critic of acting in New York. You got it all over George
Jean Nathan, Ernie. It's an injustice, Ernie, that you aren't up
here on the stage yourself, instead of out in that lobby wasting
your voice selling programmes.'</p>

<p>'I see!' said Bethel.</p>

<p><br>
They would be much quieter later, but perhaps the company were
a little loud, this first evening in the diner. Lyle Johnson and
Charlotte Levison sang 'Frankie and Johnnie'. Zed and Douglas Fry
rehearsed <i>Waiting for Lefty.</i> Iris rather loudly told
Victor Swenson her theories of make-up. When they settled down in
the sleeper again, it was already beginning to be home.</p>

<p>Three bridge games started, with suitcases, supported on
knees, for tables. Miss Staghorn was knitting. Charlotte returned
to not reading some more Marx. Hugh Challis, who belonged in the
bleak correctitude of the other car, was telling Gene Doric, the
master carpenter, about the trick Larry Lewis, the music-hall
comedian, had played on Billy Bush, the expert on playing Mayfair
butlers, at the golf club in Little Pimple, Surrey, at or about
three in the afternoon on September 16th, though it may have been
the 17th, 1903.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room, their legs rather cramped with suitcases,
Andy and Satori and Tertius Tully and Eldred, the stage manager,
were wearily scribbling on papers&mdash;papers&mdash;papers. If
Andy was a Romeo belated, he had also heard about the need of
bookkeeping.</p>

<p>Only Zed and Douglas and Bethel were reading, and she was too
restless to keep her attention even on Noel Coward's <i>Present
Indicative.</i> She raised the blind, pressed her forehead
against the cold glass, stared out on the dark farm lands that
passed her. Oh, she was going to see and grasp every state in the
vast Union!</p>

<p>In each lone light that raced past her, she saw a farmhouse,
saw the family&mdash;the father, the old aunt, the ambitious son
with his manual of automotive engineering, the wild, dangerous
daughter listening. She wanted to know them; she wanted by
playing them to give them to the world.</p>

<p>She had never been so content.</p>

<p>And that night, unsleeping but happily drowsy in her berth,
she listened to the train whistle&mdash;that familiar magic
summons to be up and wandering&mdash;from the engine on her very
own train.</p>

<hr>

<p class="quote">BELLUCA, Indiana, pop. 277,000; on the Wabusha
River; site state aviation sch.; Belluca Univ., Littlefield Art
Museum cont. a Fra Angelico, an El Greco; mfrs. plumbing
supplies, sewer pipe, machine tools, watches, gloves, glass.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">AS they all peered out of the car widows, in
Belluca, at eleven in the morning, everything was as it should
be: reporters on the platform, photographers with flashlights,
and Andy's great rich cousin, Mr. Romer Ingalls, escorted by
cousinlets and a uniformed chauffeur.</p>

<p>Whether it was because of Mr. Ingals's patronage, or because
no Eastern professional play had opened in Belluca for twenty
years, or because, in ten years now, no play except WPA
productions had been announced for more than a three-night run,
or because of a pure love of the Bard and Mrs. Lumley Boyle, the
whole city of Belluca&mdash;that is, the section of it that
considered the drama as important as ice-cream sodas&mdash;was
prepared to take the Deacon Romeo &amp; Juliet Production to its
friendly Midwestern heart.</p>

<p>Each of the three newspapers had sent at least two
reporters&mdash;the drama editor and a society chronicler. Behind
them and the light-flashing photographers were a medley of
horrible little girls with autograph albums; little girls who
would delightedly have interrupted Romeo just as he was climbing
the balcony but who would much rather have had the sacred totem
of the gangster in the film <i>Stick 'Em Up.</i> But they made a
very pretty crush to excite Bethel and Iris.</p>

<p>All but one of the reporters packed in about Mrs. Boyle. That
one was a baby-faced, eager-faced young man, who grabbed the arms
of the two girls, crowing, 'You Iris Pentire and Beth Merriday?
I'm Carl Frazee of the <i>News.</i> Look at the sacred white
journalistic cows mooing at the Boyle woman&mdash;and see her
smile at them. Not very strong on smiling privately, is she?'</p>

<p>Bethel giggled. Iris said indignantly, 'She never smiles, in
rehearsal, except when she thinks it'll make somebody mad.'</p>

<p>'Lookit, kids. I'll be in and buy you a drink, soon as you get
settled in your hotel. I suppose you'll go to the Buckingham-
Bradley.'</p>

<p>With dignity, an actress listening to the nobler call, Bethel
stated, 'I'm sorry but we have to Be In The Theatre all day.
We're Rehearsing All Afternoon, and Dress Rehearsal This Evening.
Mr. Satori decided to hold it here instead of New York. But
perhaps we'll see you some time this week. You are a
reporter?'</p>

<p>'No. He's a college boy!' sniffed Iris. 'Aren't you now,
Carl?'</p>

<p>'Ye-es. Well. I was. University of Michigan B.A. Oxford M.A.
Licentiate of the Sorbonne. And I'll do the review of your show
for the <i>News</i> to-morrow night.'</p>

<p>But of the two girls, one did have sense enough to know how
much she had been put in her place, and, from twenty-nine
cheerful words, to learn a great deal about Indiana, about the
Middle West, about the whole sprawling United States.</p>

<p>'See you soon, kids. Don't take any wooden money,' said Carl
Frazee.</p>

<p>They heard Andy's cousin, Romer Ingalls&mdash;a thick man with
a cigar and an improbable Legion of Honour ribbon&mdash;shouting,
'Course you're going to stay with us, Andy, but do you think Mrs.
Boyle would like to come, too?'</p>

<p>Andy looked horrified. 'No! I'm going to stay with My
Company!'</p>

<p>And, loving him, Bethel knew that Andrew Deacon was as young
as she, and as armourless against a cynical world.</p>

<p><br>
Reluctantly, but agreeing because it would save money, Bethel
had promised to share hotel rooms with Iris on the tour, and they
drove off together in a taxicab.</p>

<p>Iris (before she had seen any of the city) sneered that
Belluca was a 'miserable little dump', compared with New York,
which was her native city only by very recent absorption, the
vital statistics accrediting her to a side street in Wheeling,
West Virginia. To Bethel this new city seemed huge and
surprising. She looked through the rear window of the taxi at the
white limestone fa&ccedil;ade of the Union Station, with its
white tower five hundred feet high; she looked around at the
station plaza, with its fountains and sycamore alleys; and she
felt that she had come, with her fellow-adventurers in cap and
bells, on festivity to Rome.</p>

<p>The taxi sped out of the plaza, round a corner, and she saw
their first playbills:</p>

AMERICAN THEATRE<br>
Nov. 28&mdash;Dec. 3</p>

<p><br>
Before they drove up to the Hotel Buckingham-Bradley (1000
rooms, 1000 baths, your home-town newspaper at your door in the
morning), Iris and the squealing Bethel had seen nine more
posters. The girls were innocent. They did not know the
benevolent deception of what is known as 'depot billing', whereby
the company's advance man and the local theatre manager make sure
that whether the local citizens ever learn that the show is
coming or not, at least the producer, arriving in town in a state
of exaltation, doubt and suspicion, will have plenty to gladden
him on the way to the hotel section.</p>

<p><br>
Their room in the Buckingham-Bradley seemed to Bethel ten
times as large as her den in New York and&mdash;she had known so
few towns: Sladesbury, Point Royal, Grampion, New York&mdash;it
looked out over enchantingly different streets: a very fine
structure in the way of a granite jail, and a circular park with
a statue of General Nelson A. Miles.</p>

<p>But Iris was wallowing in the local Sunday newspapers, the
<i>News,</i> the <i>American</i> and the <i>Daily Republican,</i>
bought on the way up.</p>

<p>'Look! Look! Beth, look! Here's both our pictures, and stories
about us.'</p>

<p>Bethel squatted on the floor with Iris and stared at a group
picture of herself, Iris, Charlotte and Vera Cross (Lady
Capulet's understudy), all adoringly surrounding Mrs. Boyle. The
advance man had done honour to his profession as press agent. In
the <i>News</i> Bethel read a spirited account of herself (some
inches below the rhetorical splendours devoted to Mrs. Boyle) and
learned that&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">in college, at a certain famous old institution
for women on the banks of the historic Hudson River, she was
president of the dramatic club, star in many elaborate college
productions. After college her ability was immediately
recognized, and she has had such an extensive training in stock
as falls to the lot of but few young actresses.</p>

<br>

<p>Bethel moaned, 'But they might have put in my studies in the
Alva Prindle School of Garage Acting.'</p>

<p>Radio Station WXXW, owned by the Belluca <i>Daily
Republican</i> and the most influential fount of wisdom and of
jazz in all that section of Indiana, was turning over a whole
half-hour of time&mdash;magic like to Jehovah's, that can own and
turn over Time!&mdash;to an interview with the Romeo Company by
no less a local prophet than the Indiana Walter Winchell, Mr. Ted
Gronitz, mention in whose daily column 'Hot on the Spot' was more
sought by Belluca debutantes, prize fighters and pulpit orators
than was sleep or raiment. Andy, Mahala and Mrs. Boyle were to
broadcast, of course. But at lunchtime&mdash;a dozen of the
youngsters of the company at three tables down in the Buckingham-
Bradley Coffee Shop, being very professional and stagy over Ham
and Eggs, Country Style&mdash;Bethel was summoned by a bell-boy
to report at Andy's suite, to be ready to broadcast.</p>

<p>'Me... broadcast?' squeaked Bethel.</p>

<p>'Sure, I done it once. I'm a swell crooner,' said the
bellboy.</p>

<p>In Andy's suite&mdash;a Louis Seize apartment with the useful
additions of a Dinette, and a purple-and-black-tiled Kitchenette,
with an electric refrigerator&mdash;Bethel found Mr. Ted Gronitz,
their broadcaster, pacing and shrieking. He was a squat, bristly
haired little man who had been a featherweight boxer, a county
fair spieler and a financial reporter. He was a dream in
brown&mdash;brown suit, brown handkerchief at his breast, autumn-
leaf-brown tie, cigar-brown shirt and cigar-brown cigar. He
yelled amiably at her:</p>

<p>'Bethel? Listen, kid, I got nidea. Of course I'm going to
interview these stuffed shirts here&mdash;Andy and Mahally and
the Boyle&mdash;but how about getting the impressions of an
understudy? How do you like having to sit back and listen to the
old champ play Juliet when you know you could wipe her out? Ever
want to bump her off?'</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyle, listening, looked pained.</p>

<p>Not waiting for Bethel's answer, Ted Gronitz exulted, 'That'll
be fine. That'll give the old girls sitting home by the radio
something to talk about. One in ten thousand might even go to
your show. Now, Andy, I want you to keep off dramatic
subjects&mdash;you're not so hot on those&mdash;and talk about
High Sassiety in Newport. Didn't your Old Lady entertain an
English Lord there last year? Swell! That's the stuff.'</p>

<p>In panic Bethel had fled to the sheltering side of Andy and
was whispering, 'Oh, do I have to do this? I've never talked on a
mike. And he seems so&mdash;crude.'</p>

<p>'No, kitten, of course you don't have to. But it would help me
a lot. We've got to put the show over in this one town, anyway.
Can you stand it?'</p>

<p>'Oh, of course, Andy!' she glowed... To be able to 'help a
lot', to help Andy Deacon! For that she had been born!</p>

<p><br>
The <i>Daily Republican</i> building was an aged pile of
pasty-faced yellow brick, and the corridors were inky and lathy,
but as the delegation of five from the Romeo Company, headed by
Ted Gronitz and Tertius Tully, stepped from the elevator into the
top story, devoted to Station WXXW, they were in a set from the
Follies. The vestibule, lined with fawn-coloured leather, was
filled with 'modernistic' chairs with scarlet-and-yellow leather
seats and nickel arms and legs and had, at the end, a tall desk,
beneath which stood the chorus: slim girls in uniforms as
military as Bethel's on stage, with cocky pill-box caps.</p>

<p>'Peg, go in and tell the old man the Shakespeare and Barnum
and Bailey Circus has arrived,' yelled Gronitz, and one seraph
darted away. She returned with Andy's cousin, Ingalls, and six
eyeglassed men, as portly and solemn as canons. Bethel never did
find out just who they all were, but they all looked like
observers at an execution as, in terror, seizing Andy's arm, she
marched down the cork-floored gallows walk to Studio No. 3.</p>

<p>The broadcasting room itself was cheery enough, and a little
on the littered side: a long room managing to contain two grand
pianos, a row of nickel-and-ebony folding
chairs&mdash;immediately occupied by the observers&mdash;a harp,
a bust of Beethoven, a plaster Tudor fireplace with electric
logs, and a directors' table. But in the centre was a thin
standard on which was a double-faced microphone, like a double-
ended wedge. From the side it resembled the stiffly upreared head
of a boa constrictor; from the front, an electric toaster.</p>

<p>Bethel quaked with the thought of the millions about to listen
to her, in city homes and automobiles and those farmhouses always
designated in radio accounts as 'far-flung'. Far-flung farmhouses
with gimlet-eyed, terrier-eared, far-flung farm wives listening
to Bethel Merriday!</p>

<p>In a coop shut off from the studio by a glass-window wall was
an engineer at a gigantic control board. Would he, maybe, cut her
off the air if she wasn't at once very reverent and very witty?
He was such a dry, stern, green-eyeshaded engineer, not likely to
be tender to dewy young actresses.</p>

<p>She was trembling.</p>

<p>Of course there was no proof whatever that millions were going
to listen to her, or ever did listen to her. In fact with the two
or three broadcasts every week which she was going to do on the
rest of the tour, she had no proof that anybody ever did hear
her. Perhaps no one did.</p>

<p>Mr. Ted Gronitz was capering with not the slightest awe. As
the red second hand on the clock on the wall reached the exact
half-hour, Ted pulled the microphone stand toward him as though
it were a lively sweetheart and chuckled, softly, rapidly:</p>

<p>'Hot spots on the air! Ted Gronitz speaking from the Belluca
<i>Daily Republican</i> offices. I've got a real hot culturureal
hot spot for you this afternoon, boys and girls, but I can't get
going before I whet my whistle with a bottle of Corn-Cola, the
new thirst quencher and taste tickler. Yum, yum, yum, maybe that
wasn't good.'</p>

<p>He didn't really have a bottle of Corn-Cola there, you know.
He was pretending. And Bethel was moaning inwardly, 'What has all
this got to do with playing Shakespeare?'</p>

<p>'YESSIR, folks, that goes right to the spot. Don't forget: at
your druggist's or grocer's, five cents the throw, CORN-COLA, and
you'll thank me for the tip.</p>

<p>'Now who do you think we've got with us this afternoon, folks?
None other than Romeo and Juliet themselves, the most famous
lovers in history, and you'd better look sharp, all you young
folks, and get on to how the professionals do their love-making.
YESSIR, for the first time in a quarter of a century, Belluca is
being honoured by the world premeer...'</p>

<p><br>
He said that Mrs. Lumley Boyle was too great an actress and
too good a sport to mind a little kidding, and so would Mrs.
Boyle tell them how many English counts and lords and kings and
barons and all those she had kissed?</p>

<p>A number, it seemed, by her modest account.</p>

<p>And now would Andrew Deacon&mdash;once known as Ole Andy
Deacon, the Pride of the Yale Gridiron&mdash;tell the boys and
girls how he would win a Juliet if he met her off-stage?</p>

<p>Bethel saw his Adam's apple bobbing and his eyes turning
inside out with fear as Andy tried to be witty and then,
earnestly, boyishly (sweetly, she thought, and pretty badly)
switched into an account of what he was trying to do: pour into
the immortal body of Shakespeare the life blood of to-day.</p>

<p>Suddenly Andy had drooped away from the microphone and had
sunk in one of the line of folding chairs, mopping his head,
while she wanted to run over and kiss him and tell him how good
he was. It was presumably Mahala's turn to be pixie. But,
horribly, it was at herself that Ted was grinning, while he
chatted to his audience:</p>

<p>'Now we'll get away from the big guns of the stage and turn
the mike over to a darling kid, Bethel Merriday, Mrs. Boyle's
understudy, who if you could see her, as I do now, all you
youngsters would rush in and try to date her up for the next ten
years. Here you are, Beth. Attagirl!'</p>

<p>Certainly by no volition of her own she had got from her chair
to the other side of the standard from Ted and was facing that
mocking small grid, her knees and stomach failing her, as Ted
piped, 'Now tell us, baby, what's your chief ambition?' And by no
will of her own, Bethel was answering&mdash;instantly, briskly,
'To be as good an actress as Mrs. Boyle some day'.</p>

<p>She smiled over at the star, who beamed back, eyes like black
glass. Bethel never had any trouble with Mrs. Boyle after that
day&mdash;no violent trouble.</p>

<p>'Why do you want to go on the stage, Belli, pretty kid like
you?'</p>

<p>'Because I believe that if an actress can do
it&mdash;<i>if</i> she can&mdash;she'll be something bigger than
her own self, when she's playing great roles.'</p>

<p>Bethel realized that she could snap back answers instantly;
that Andy and Tertius Tully were nodding to each other, as who
should say that she was good.</p>

<p>'The great tradition, eh? That's the stuff. But wouldn't you
rather marry a handsome fellow with lots of money?'</p>

<p>'I would not!'</p>

<p>'What's your advice to the girls that would like to get on the
stage?'</p>

<p>'Work and wait, I guess.'</p>

<p>As she went on&mdash;on&mdash;on&mdash;four prodigious
minutes, Bethel hated everything she was saying more and more.
She was being banal. She was being smirkingly good-natured. It
wasn't good enough!</p>

<p>And still she went on, while Ted smiled gratitude for her
quickness. What choked and stopped her at last was not disgust
with her own glibness but a panicky feeling that the blank
microphone before her was not connected. It never applauded. It
never changed. She was talking into a cold hole in the air, and
that contemptuous coldness defeated her.</p>

<p>At the end she heard them all praising her. Andy cried,
'Darling, you're going to be one of our biggest roper-
inners.'</p>

<p>Then she saw Zed Wintergeist&mdash;heaven knows when or why he
had got into the room&mdash;standing by the door, smiling
bitterly, and she was very sick.</p>

<p>And was Ted Gronitz, in the derisive secret refuges of his
heart, as vulgar and half literate as he seemed? He had used Hugh
Challis's favourite war cry, 'The great tradition'. She was
frightened.</p>

<p>But in the dress rehearsal she forgot all that.</p>

<p>They had held two scenery rehearsals in New York, but this,
their first complete dress rehearsal, began at five o'clock
Sunday afternoon and staggered to something like an ending at
five o'clock next morning.</p>

<p>As they walked from their hotel for the rehearsal, Iris
insisted that they enter by way of the theatre lobby, to see the
frames with their photographs. 'Nosir!' Bethel said stoutly. 'I'm
going back to the stage entrance. That's where an actor belongs,
and only an actor has any real right to enter there. Lobby?
Frames? The laity can have those. Huh! The carriage trade!'</p>

<p>(But it is true, however, that she had already seen a frame,
in the hotel lobby!)</p>

<p>Like a priestess, alone privileged to enter the sanctuary by
the low sacred door, Bethel skipped along a cobble-paved alley,
between the side of a steam laundry and the back of the old
American Theatre of Belluca. She chattered to Iris, but she
chattered to keep from crying, for she was remembering the
Crystal Theatre of Sladesbury, and Caryl McDermid and frail Elsie
Krall, and the first time she had dared go back to watch their
glory-trailing appearance at the stage door. The rough, dark red
brick side wall of the alley seemed to her beautiful; something
out of Dickens, or an enchantment that belonged to Garrick and
Mrs. Siddons and Eleonora Duse.</p>

<p>Except for Grampion and the temporary refuges for rehearsals
in New York, this was her first theatre; it really was hers; it
belonged to her, and she served it. Looking down from the ivory,
cloud-hung thrones of the seraphim, she listened to the
doorman&mdash;satisfactorily old and moustached and
wrinkled&mdash;when he snapped, 'You girls in the cast?' They
smiled at him, entered his narrow coop, and, having left New York
a whole twenty-two hours ago, both Iris and she looked carefully
through the letters in the box below the call-board.</p>

<p>Bethel stole away from Iris, to be alone in her first moment
of coming out on a professional stage.</p>

<p>Andy and Satori were yelling; Zed Wintergeist was yelling in
his dressing-room and simultaneously playing an unexplained
violin; the company stagehands were yelling at the local stage
crew; Douglas Fry was going quietly about with a floor plan in
front of his nose; pillars of plywood and stone walls of canvas
were leaning over threateningly as they were moved into place.
But the curtain was up, and as Bethel slipped through an entrance
and stood down on the apron of the stage, looking into the
enormous unpeopled auditorium, this, her cathedral, was quiet as
midnight, awesome as the still tombs in the cathedral crypt.</p>

<p>The American Theatre of Belluca, which remembered the chariot
race in <i>Ben Hur,</i> was a handsome, portly old house, with
three balconies, terminating in the perilous mountain shelf of
the old-fashioned 'nigger heaven'. The ceiling, in dark wooden
panels divided by smoke-darkened ridges of gold, was painted with
the twisted Richard III, with Lear raving to the breakers, with
soft-sighing Rosalind. The boxes were gilded sea shells. The
seats were in faded red plush upholstery; the sharply raked
aisles carpeted in maroon. It was in dolorous taste, but it was a
real theatre, not a movie shop with neat walls of tan-tinted
celotex.</p>

<p>All of the sixteen hundred seats that she could see climbing
up in front of her looked like flat-chested people, quiet,
polite-faced, waiting for her to begin to act. And she was not
afraid of them as she had been of the silent cynicism on the
porous face of the microphone. She wanted to begin.</p>

<p><br>
She was to share a dressing-room with Charlotte Levison, Vera
Gross and Mabel Staghorn, the character woman who belaboured the
part of the Nurse on stage and belaboured sweetness off. As they
dressed for this final rehearsal&mdash;Charlotte as Rue-de-la-
Paix Lady Montague&mdash;Bethel was envious of their make-ups.
Charlotte, that handsome countess of Communism, with touches of
blue-grey along the sides of her nose, became high-well-born, and
Miss Staghorn, in her own person a mirror of the Ladies' Foreign
Missionary Society of Augusta, Maine, became red-nosed and ribald
and toothless.</p>

<p>Proudly they took themselves out on the damp cement basement
floor, bordering which were the coops of their dressing-rooms.
All the company, so long familiar, were exclaiming over one
another's metamorphoses. Only Andy, in the tweed jacket and grey
bags which he intended to wear as a gay and easy-going Romeo,
seemed the same kind self.</p>

<p>Zed, Henry Purvis, Geoffrey Hoy and Tudor
Blackwall&mdash;Mercutio, Tybalt, Benvolio and Paris&mdash;they
were in the uniforms of Italian officers. No, worse than that:
they were suddenly professional actors, and our Bethel felt
herself entirely out of it, wanted to blow her little amateur
nose and run home crying.</p>

<p>It was Zed who most overwhelmed her. That tousled young rebel,
with the frayed ties and the wrinkled soft shirt collars, was an
incredibly elegant young nobleman now, a fencer and polo player
and aviator, with his oiled hair, his tall peaked uniform cap
cockily tilted, his wide shoulders, his thin knees in riding
breeches, his scornfully shining boots. Bethel would have told
you, earnestly and honestly, that she loathed war and hated
Fascism, but when Captain Zed Mercutio-Montague stalked toward
her with the gay hard grin of the warrior, when he shouted,
'Well, pet, how do you like your totalitarian hero?' when he
squeezed her shoulder&mdash;superior, reckless, probably
cruel&mdash;she was faint, and from no democratic ideology.</p>

<p>When Charlotte saw the uniforms, she clasped her hands like
Modjeska and wailed, 'But I hate everything Fascist! I can't stay
on in this show!' Harry Purvis (Ph.D., but sober now), flaunted,
'So do I hate it. But don't tie the party line around the end of
your nose, my comrade and my particular darling. Who's ever going
to connect Tybalt with the Duce? Let's go argue about it.'
Charlotte went.</p>

<p>Then the curtain was down, and in front of it Bethel was
quavering her prologue. As she came off, Satori grunted at her,
'Okay. Just remember three things: keep your head up, so the
gallery can see and hear you. Enunciate&mdash;let's hear your
<i>r</i>'s and <i>t</i>'s and <i>m</i>'s. And if your foot slips
in a line, don't ever go back and correct it. Okay. <i>Take her
up!'</i></p>

<p>They took her up&mdash;her being the curtain&mdash;and the
theory was that, on its rising, Sampson Nooks and Peter Antonio
Murphy would gaily be clumping out, ready for a street row. They
weren't. They had, that second, appallingly found that one of
them had gold buttons on his livery coat and the other
silver.</p>

<p><br>
That meant a conference of Satori, Andy, Nooks, Murphy and
Mrs. Golly, the wardrobe mistress, who finally relieved them all
by the inspired suggestion of keeping the buttons as they
were&mdash;the audience would think it was intentional. Once,
under canvas, Mrs. Golly had played moonshiners' beautiful
daughters, then moonshiners' loyal wives, and finally
moonshiners' comic grandmothers; and she had played Juliet for
two nights in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in 1906.</p>

<p><br>
For twelve blasphemous hours, when everybody slumped on chairs
and looked glassy-eyed above limp cigarettes, they carried on
what Satori afterward called a fine, satisfactory dress
rehearsal.</p>

<p>Over Act I, Scene V&mdash;Romeo's first glimpse of Juliet, at
Capulet's party&mdash;there was an hour of shrieking conference.
None of the walk-ons, which included all the young people in the
company, agreed with any other on just which cue they were to
come gambolling in as maskers. Half the batteries in their
electric torches would not work. There was a loud ideological and
commercial argument with the union musician who was running the
phonograph producing guaranteed genuine old Italian dance music,
off-stage, and at this moment of painful class struggle Zed
pleased everybody by piping up with what nobody had thought of
till now: they ought, with modern clothes, to have modern tango
music.</p>

<p>'Oh, shut up!' said Andy to Zed.</p>

<p>'Okay,' said Zed.</p>

<p>There was battle over the <i>ad libs</i> of the entering
Bacchantes at the Capulet party. Iris, in character, kept saying,
'Oh, isn't this a lovely party, I think it's just dandy' and Lyle
Johnson (as a Cinquescento Veronese) kept growling, 'What's the
idea we can't smoke in this show; it would be twice as natural;
modern costume&mdash;nuts!' And first they were too loud, then
Satori couldn't hear them at all, then they were too loud
again.</p>

<p>And a completely serious debate as to whether Tybalt-Purvis
ought to carry brass knuckles (benevolently replacing the wicked
ancient rapier) in the pocket of his white evening waistcoat...
.</p>

<p>And a half-hour's wait while Satori, Andy, Stage Manager
Eldred and Kinloch, the electrician, turned lights off and on,
and apparently got none of the effects they wanted, and
apparently didn't care much. Hoy and Lyle and Harry Purvis sat on
the floor meantime, lighting cigarettes and smearily crushing out
the butts, and yawned, 'What the hell's holding us up now? Why
the hell don't they get on with it? How the hell do they expect
us to give a show tomorrow night? Who the hell is running this
amateur benefit? The hell!'</p>

<p>But Zed was surprisingly patient. Given a rehearsal, he seemed
to have none of the nerves and muscles and stomach that in all
the others were quivering with shaky weariness. This was his
sport. He only grinned when, listening to Andy's fervent, 'Oh,
she doth teach the torches to burn bright... beauty too rich
for use, for earth too dear!' Tony Murphy snarled, 'Zed, I don't
know how long I can stand here and listen to that student
emote!'</p>

<p>All of Bethel's curiosity and her eagerness chilled as she
heard this. She did not know whether it was more for love of Andy
or her own pride as a judge of acting... She had been moved
again by Andy's warmth and richness and clear nobility... Was
she perhaps wrong&mdash;was he perhaps bad?...</p>

<p>Whatever went wrong&mdash;even Lyle Johnson's insertions of a
filling-station 'Yuh!' in emendation of the Bard, and the failure
of the stage manager's off-stage revolver, with which he had to
give voice to Romeo's and Tybalt's pistols, to make any sound but
a flat click&mdash;the immediate criminal invariably said, 'Oh,
that'll be all right to-morrow', and that seemed to repair
everything. It was all magic and madness.</p>

<p>Every two hours Andy had coffee and sandwiches brought in. The
rehearsal halted, and the comparative silence of homicidal
arguments about direction gave way to a crash of joyous babbling,
and they all, except perhaps Tony Murphy, loved one another. Hugh
Challis murmured, 'In forty-five years on the stage, Bethel, I've
occasionally known producers who served coffee once during a
dress rehearsal. And I've occasionally known producers who
borrowed the money from the actors to go out and get coffee for
themselves. But I've none too often heard of one who thought that
actors could take to eating as a regular accomplishment. This
Andy is a very sweet lad. You're fond of him, I take it.'</p>

<p>'W-why&mdash;y-yes&mdash;Yes, I am! Very!'</p>

<p>'Splendid. And I rather think, my good girl, that one of these
days he'll have time to take a look at our Mahala and see what a
tuppeny-ha'penny young woman she is, and turn to you.'</p>

<p>'Me? I don't think there is much of a Me yet, Mr.
Challis.'</p>

<p>'No? Perhaps not. Perhaps not. There will be, I fancy, when
our company is a great success. Oh yes, we shall be. Can't afford
not to be.'</p>

<p>'No!'</p>

<p>Toward three a.m., when even Satori and Zed and Andy were worn
down and Mrs. Boyle began to vanish backstage and to smell,
though faintly, of whisky, then that old Player King, that
Vincent Crummles of the purple sage, Wyndham Nooks, rose to his
own.</p>

<p>By the time they had reached the chief of Mr. Nooks's three
roles, that of the Apothecary, no one else cared what he did with
it. But Mr. Nooks cared. He was convinced that he could 'steal
the show' with his enactment of the meagre and inhibited
bootlegger, and now he gave his all. In New York he had read the
Apothecary's line, 'My poverty, but not my will, consents',
inoffensively. But he chose the dress rehearsal to pause after
'my poverty', to raise his chin, look up to God, hold it for
three agonizing seconds, then hurl 'but not my will' into the
teeth of destiny.</p>

<p>Satori, watching from the tenth row of the orchestra, held up
his hand. 'Mr. Nooks! What are you doing?'</p>

<p>'I don't understand, Mr. Director.'</p>

<p>'You are giving rather an exaggerated characterization to the
unfortunate Apothecary.'</p>

<p>'I've always thought he was a real cameo of a character
picture, and nobody has ever done enough with him. I'm trying to
show how the Apothecary is the victim of awful bad luck, and poor
fellow, he has to do this awful thing&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Quite, Mr. Nooks. Yes. A cameo. But I don't want it to be
such a big cameo and get dropped on Romeo's head. I think I'd
just play it down.'</p>

<p>Nooks breathed with the joy of being, for the first time, the
centre of a Kulturkampf. Ignoring Satori's impatient fingers on
the orchestra seat in front of him, Nooks droned, 'Well now, I'll
tell you, Mr. Director, I acted it that way when I was with Otto
Knippler's company, and Otto said it was real good; he said it
was different. And while we're discussing it, Mr. Director, if
you don't mind a suggestion from an old actor, I think when Romeo
enters, in this scene, and sees me&mdash;you know he says, "I see
that thou art poor"&mdash;he ought to pause and look me over more
carefully. I know you're trying to get tempo and all that modern
stuff, but when I was with Theodate Thuriber, in 1907, she
said&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Mr. Nooks!' Satori's voice was rather high. 'This is the
dress rehearsal! We'll dispense with all ancient
history&mdash;all of it!'</p>

<p>'But Mr. Director&mdash;'</p>

<p><i>'You heard what I said!'</i></p>

<p>Bethel was hurt by the drop of Nooks's seamed old jaw and the
glaze in his eyes.</p>

<p>But, an hour later, Nooks was trying to tell a testy Victor
Swenson, Prince of Verona, how to return the curtsy of his awed
subjects, and she perceived that not time nor tide nor fate's
unkindest slam can dull the smiling smugness of the ham.</p>

<p>The last skirmish across the barricades, at a quarter to five
on that icy November morning, was the schedule of curtain
calls.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyle suggested, brightly, 'Wouldn't this save a lot of
time, Mr. Satori? Not bring the minor members of the cast on at
all? I'm sure they'll all be very competent some day&mdash;if
they ever learn to act. But just now, I don't really see why the
Public should be interested in them. I think it would be an
interesting and quite original way to have me take my calls,
first with Romeo, then with Mercutio, then with the two Capulets,
then with the Nurse, then with Tybalt, then with Friar Laurence,
then with Paris, and just forget the others.'</p>

<p>Now Bethel knew why Satori was a good director. Debonair,
blithe&mdash;at 4.47 a.m. and 37<sup>0</sup> above&mdash;he
trilled, 'I think it would be original and sensible. But what can
you and I do against the selfishness and conceit of actors, Mrs.
Boyle? I'm afraid we'll have to let them be seen.'</p>

<p>And at the end he said to Andy, to the peppery-eyed Bethel's
admiration and dumbfounding, 'Let's go out and find a drink. It's
been a first-rate dress rehearsal&mdash;very easy and
satisfactory. Worked like a clock, didn't it?'</p>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN her energetic small life, Bethel had rarely
loafed and lolled and languished; and never, till this morning
between dress rehearsal and first night, had she revelled in it.
But to-day she slept till noon, and lay afterward on the bed,
gossiping yawningly with Iris, reading the newspapers down to the
real-estate transfers, and feeling like an actress in society
novels. But in her new plain camel's-hair dressing-gown and her
pale blue cotton pyjamas, she looked like a counsellor in a
girls' camp; while Iris's pale delicacy was set off by plum-
coloured silk pyjamas piped with white, and a dressing-gown of
green taffeta with a batik scarf for sash. On her milky feet were
mules of gilded alligator hide.</p>

<p>'Isn't that outfit all new?' said Bethel. Maybe just on the
sniffy side.</p>

<p>'And how!'</p>

<p>'Where'd you ever raise the money?'</p>

<p>Iris smiled, tender as a young cobra. 'A gentleman friend, he
asked me if I had anything to wear cold mornings on the tour, and
I said no&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But you have! You had a swell dressing-gown in Grampion.'</p>

<p>'Oh. That? I&mdash;lost it. And I said no, and he just
<i>dragged</i> me into Bonwit Teller's and bought this
layout&mdash;honestly, I had no <i>idea</i> he meant it for
<i>me,</i> I thought he just wanted my advice about colours, I
thought prob'ly he meant it for his sister or somebody, and then
when he shoved the parcels in my arms and said, "It's all yours,
baby", I was so surprised, and I said, "For <i>me?</i> Oh I can't
take presents from a man", and he said if I didn't take 'em, he'd
throw 'em down the subway, and I made it clear he couldn't buy my
affections, not with anything, and he said yes, sure, he
understood that. So what could I do?' The epithet 'gold digger'
dazzled Bethel's mind as crimson spheres dazzle the lidded eyes
when you close them in bed, but she managed to keep still, as she
made several notes about rooming by herself before the tour was
over. She recalled now Iris's new silver bracelet, her new silver
brush and comb; she remembered Iris coming out of a luggage shop,
in New York, with Zed Wintergeist&mdash;and Iris had a new hatbox
with that shop's label.</p>

<p>But she didn't want to be a prig. She did think the bumptious
Zed ought to have enough wit to protect himself. Perhaps, on that
page in Saint Peter's folio devoted to Bethel, there stands a
small gold star because she shut up.</p>

<p>With innocent outrageousness, young gentlemen also in
dressing-gowns&mdash;Andy, Douglas Fry, Lyle Johnson, Antonio
Murphy&mdash;banged at the door and came in and sat on the beds
and talked about the only subjects that could be of interest to
the world&mdash;how the dress rehearsal had gone, how Miss
Staghorn had blown, and the prospects for tonight. By evening
there were cigarette butts in every receptacle in the room except
Bethel's slippers. And in a growing, edgy tension, ten of them,
boiling with chatter, ate at a round table in the Coffee
Shop.</p>

<p>'Gosh, we've got to be good!' agonized Henry Purvis. 'I hear
the house is sold out.'</p>

<p>'And there's a reviewer come from <i>Chicago!'</i> quaked
Charlotte.</p>

<p>Mahala leered at Bethel, 'And the audience aren't good
neighbours here, like a summer theatre, that are pulling for you
to succeed. These are wolves. They want their two dollars and
eighty cents' worth.'</p>

<p>And so they shakily set out to walk to the theatre and the
opening.</p>

<p><br>
When, in her Goddess of Liberty gown for the role of Prologue,
Bethel stood way down right in the wings, listening to the
orchestra's slow murder of Tchaikovsky and waiting for the signal
to go on, when it was too late to do anything about it, she knew
that her first nights in <i>A Doll's House</i> and <i>Stage
Door</i> hadn't helped her in the least, and that if she played
for thirty years and endured fifty first nights, she would be
just as terrified and just as watery in the knees.</p>

<p>Terrified of what? she demanded.</p>

<p>Of making a fool of herself before that mob&mdash;friendly,
gay and cruel. Of forgetting her lines. Of standing out there a
bedlam fool.</p>

<p>Then Nathan Eldred, gently pushing, was muttering, 'On you go,
dear. Good luck!' and she was edging between the tormentor and
the backing flats, in front of the curtain, holding her small
hands out to the sudden-silenced audience and appealing: 'Two
households, both alike in dignity, in fair Verona, where we lay
our scene...'</p>

<p>Her voice was warm and young and so earnest. She was begging
them so to love the pair of star-crossed lovers.</p>

<p>As the voice went on, without her having much to do with it,
she found that she could, through the haze of beams from the
spotlights, make out, not individual faces, but the circling
front of the top balcony. She must have unknown friends up there,
among the students; all the young girls and boys who wanted to go
on the stage. They were with her&mdash;and all her terror was
gone.</p>

<p>Her voice came sure and urgent at the end of the prologue:</p>

<p>'If you with patient ears attend, what here shall miss, our
toil shall strive to mend.'</p>

<p>'Swell!' whispered Eldred, as she pushed back into the wings
again, and the pompous curtain set sail upward.</p>

<p><br>
As much as she could, she watched from the wings.</p>

<p>Andy maintained through the play the easy serenity he had
shown at dress rehearsal, but Zed Wintergeist ceased to be
himself; he was Mercutio, completely. His Mab speech was half
drunk with young fantasy; in his duel with Tybalt he was the
young nobleman, fierce, swift, haughty, one who could revel in
every sin save cowardice.</p>

<p>Doc Keezer&mdash;in frock coat and reversed collar, as Friar
Laurence&mdash;stood beside Bethel, his arm lightly through hers,
as they watched Zed's last scene: Mercutio blazingly angry with
Death, but not afraid.</p>

<p>Doc sighed: 'I certainly don't like that young Wintergeist. He
thinks he knows it all... and he whistles in his dressing-
room. I'm not superstitious, but everybody knows that's bad luck.
And he's the kind that'd treat women like cattle. But just the
same, <i>he</i> ought to be playing Romeo!'</p>

<p>'And what ought Andy to be playing?'</p>

<p>'My two parts, chick. He'd be a fine sun-ripened Montague and
a holy friar. And me, I ought to be playing animal noises on the
radio. Or playing checkers back in Vermont. I'll lure you up
there yet.'</p>

<p><br>
It seemed to roll. Andy was voluminously in love; Mrs. Boyle
sighed her softest sighs; Hugh Challis-Capulet was undiluted acid
of domestic petulance; and Mabel Staghorn the most lewdly winking
beldam that ever set a gallery giggling.</p>

<p>In the one long intermission the actors hugged one another,
not quite sure just whom they were hugging, and shook the powder
off their make-up aprons, and screamed, 'Oh, they're loving
it&mdash;they're eating it up&mdash;we've got a Success!'</p>

<p>And when, a little reluctant to end the sweet last chords,
Bethel appealed to them with her epilogue&mdash;'Go hence, to
have more talk of these sad things'&mdash;the applause was like
the roof falling.</p>

<p>There were sixteen curtain calls. And on one of them Andy led
out Bethel and Iris, and it seemed to Bethel that the pounding
hands were louder than for Mrs. Boyle and Mahala. At the end of
it all, Andy made a curtain speech, while Bethel stood in the
wings and worshipped. He was boyish and grateful and endearingly
awkward:</p>

<p>... They were all so grateful to this, the first audience to
greet their humble efforts, and if the audience had half the
pleasure that the company had felt...</p>

<p>Zed, beside Bethel, was grunting, 'What a lousy Mothers' Day
speech <i>that</i> is!'</p>

<p>Bethel actually swung about, her hand up like a cat's paw, to
slap him, and if she stayed her hand, it was because of Zed's
expectant leering and not for the sake of manners befitting a
little lady. Later she heard Iris confiding to Zed, 'Let's go out
and dance after the show; I've heard about a place with a hot
orchestra', and Zed agreeing. But it was over, and they were all
too tired to be anything but hysterically happy.</p>

<p><br>
She had seven opening-night telegrams. (Andy had sixty-three,
Mrs. Boyle had four, Hugh Challis had one hundred and sixteen,
and Zed had seventeen.) In one wire Fletcher Hewitt coaxed
her.</p>

<br>


<p class="telegram">THIS NIGHT DO ENVY YOU HOWEVER WE GOING HAVE
HOUSEFUL GUESTS CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS WISH WERE THERE TO-NIGHT TO
GIVE EARNEST WISHES IN PERSON DON'T FORGET FLETCHER.</>

<br>

<p>But most astounding was the wire from Professor Miss
Bickling:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">IN YOUR GREAT TRIUMPH DO NOT FORGET OLD
FRIENDS WHO WERE HAPPY EARLY TO PREDICT YOUR FUTURE SUCCESS.</p>

<br>

<p>Bethel laid that yellow telegram down in a mess of tan powder
and burnt-out paper matches and lining pencils and sat quiet,
almost weeping. She had forgotten Miss Bickling and Point Royal
College. They were antique and dated and a little absurd and
achingly kind.</p>

<p>It was six months and nine days since she had played Nora.</p>

<p><br>
The Belluca stage doorman had pretty liberal ideas about
admitting visitors without bothering himself by taking in their
cards.</p>

<p>Into their dressing-room&mdash;Charlotte's, Vera Cross's, Miss
Staghorn's and Bethel's&mdash;after the play, the visitors moved
like doubtful elephants blundering down to a new waterhole.
Charlotte had two Belluca residents who apparently knew and
detested each other: a tall woman, very diamond and sable and
positive, and a thin, shy, olive-coloured young man who was
certainly either a Communist or so guilty about not being one
that he was going to a psychoanalyst. There was no one for
Vera&mdash;who was at least as lost an orphan as Bethel&mdash;and
for Miss Staghorn only an overstuffed woman who sighed between
phrases and smiled as though it hurt her. She had apparently
given up the stage for matrimony, and didn't think it had been
much of an idea.</p>

<p>Then, with horror, Bethel saw oozing into the door a trial of
her own: a classmate in Point Royal whom she had always disliked.
She was, in fact, the kind of a girl who wasn't any kind of a
girl but solely a classmate. Bethel was yet to learn that there
is a separate breed, roughly to be classed among human beings,
called College Classmates. You can recognize the species on the
street ten buildings away, but never place any of its
individuals. 'That looks like a classmate,' you say, and
shudder.</p>

<p>This particular one had had the habit of leaning over Bethel's
shoulder at a table in the college library and smacking gum,
slowly and firmly, in her ear. She entered now remarking: 'And
you never even let me know you were coming! Getting the big head
already!'</p>

<p>'Why, Mary, I didn't know you lived here in Belluca!' gurgled
Bethel.</p>

<p>Of course she didn't know it! If she had, that would have been
the one secret, haunting horror in this otherwise benign and
imperial city.</p>

<p>'Oh yes, I'm married now!'</p>

<p>Already? Impossible! Bethel felt herself still a baby.</p>

<p>'Well, isn't that dandy?' said Bethel.</p>

<p>'Oh yes, I'm very happy. But my, who ever thought you'd be an
actress. You were so cranky to everybody about acting in college,
and talking about discipline and what have you, that I thought
you really hated it!'</p>

<p>Oh, a darling, just a Belluca darling.</p>

<p>The classmate was followed by a woman, stringy and chronically
indignant and to Bethel perfectly strange, who shrieked, 'Well,
Beth, guess you don't remember me.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm sorry&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well, 's matter of fact, I don't know how you could, because
you never saw me, not really, but I'm your cousin Lizzie.'</p>

<p>'Oh-uh.'</p>

<p>'Well, your second cousin, I guess it is, really. Lizzie
Porch&mdash;you know&mdash;Mrs. Reginald Porch. My husband is in
gents' outfitting, but he hasn't been so well lately. I'm your
mother's sister's husband's first wife's daughter, and I don't
know just what that makes us, but after all, relatives are
relatives, aren't they, and they can't very well be
strangers.'</p>

<p>'Yes, that's dandy!' said Bethel. Detestable word 'dandy' with
which she had not befouled her virginal tongue since she had left
Sladesbury but that she had used now&mdash;so corrupting and
hideous are unwanted visitors to dressing-rooms&mdash;twice in
five minutes. 'That's dandy. And did you enjoy our show?'</p>

<p>'That's what I came to see you about. Reggie and I can't
afford to buy theatre tickets, now that we're paying for the new
car and the new electric garbage disposer and Junior's tennis
lessons, but of course as you're my cousin, I did think it would
be nice to honour you while you're here by giving you a supper
party, with a theatre party beforehand, and I'd be delighted to
arrange it any time you say, any evening at all, except Wednesday
or Thursday, and if you'll choose the time that's most convenient
to you, and if you could get me eight tickets&mdash;they needn't
be in a box; the orchestra would be all right&mdash;I'll go right
ahead and arrange it.'</p>

<p>There had been time when Bethel's feeling for Mabel Staghorn
had been somewhat less than adoration. Mabel asked questions
about her feelings for Andy; Mabel looked at the notes on
Bethel's little pad; Mabel had a hot and puffy hand. But now did
Mabel arise and become a comrade at arms.</p>

<p>'Excuse my intruding, Mrs. Porch, but Beth is so shy she'd
never tell you&mdash;but you know she's cuing all of us every
evening&mdash;gracious, almost till dawn, sometimes&mdash;and of
course you know that she'd have to buy the tickets, and eight
times two-eighty&mdash;what does that make?&mdash;I never
<i>was</i> any good at figures, but it'd set her back somewhere
around twenty-five bucks, wouldn't it, and nobody asked me, but
it strikes me that's a whole lot to ask of a cousin you never
seen before!'</p>

<p>'Oh, if you feel <i>that</i> way about it, but I must say, it
strikes me as a pretty poor return for all my efforts to
introduce Bethel to some of the most influential people in town!'
said Mrs. Porch to Mabel, and to Bethel, 'But of course if you
prefer casual people you just met on the stage to your own flesh
and blood, well, all I can say is&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Good night,' suggested Charlotte.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Porch was stamping out, and Bethel was very happy and
a professional and a success beyond dreams... for ten minutes
more.</p>

<p><br>
She had assumed that the lot of them would go somewhere to
celebrate, that night. Andy would take care of it&mdash;trust old
Andy.</p>

<p>She came out into the waste of cement floor about the
dressing-rooms, to see Zed going off with Iris, Charlotte with
her two friends and with Henry Purvis, Vera Cross with young
Douglas Fry, and then a whole cavalcade. Andy's rich cousin and
his wife were leading it, and after them, laughing, shouting,
misquoting Shakespeare, came Andy, Mahala, Mrs. Boyle and Hugh
Challis, and they were all in evening clothes.</p>

<p>It was the first time that Bethel had ever seen Andy in the
unapproachable magnificence of tails, white tie, top hat and
ebony stick. Mahala was in an ivory frock, and Andy's cousin was
Raleighesquely hanging her cape about her.</p>

<p>They all went past Bethel, at her dressing-room door, with not
one look.</p>

<p>She felt not so much poor and dull-tongued and unbeautiful as
immature and brattish. How had she ever dared to think that she
could be really friendly with smiling, surefooted, older gods
like Andy?</p>

<p>She saw herself walking alone back to the hotel, into the
littered double room to which Iris would not return till dawn.
The glory of being Epilogue in a silk dress was gone. And the
small of her back hurt with weariness. She turned toward the
stairs up from the basement.</p>

<p>Then there was Andy, flying down to her, his Inverness cape
(so silly to her, and so darling!) agitated with his speed,
crying to her, 'Beth, it just occurred to me that some of you
kids won't be having a party to-night. How about you and Iris and
Vera?'</p>

<p>'They're&mdash;uh&mdash;going dancing.'</p>

<p>'You're alone?'</p>

<p>'It doesn't matter, I'd rather be. I'm so tired.'</p>

<p>'Darling! Poor sweet darling! Now you <i>do</i> look like a
half-drowned kitten&mdash;back all ruffled and paws all
wet&mdash;shaking 'em so ruefully! I'll tell you what. Come along
with us.'</p>

<p>'I couldn't.'</p>

<p>'You'd save my life! My cousin is <i>the</i> worst stuffed
shirt in a family renowned for stuffiness and shirtiness.'</p>

<p>From the stairs, the voice of Romer Ingalls, the cousin:
'Andy? Where are you? Come on! We're waiting.'</p>

<p>Andy urged her, 'Oh, come on. It'll be a favour to me. I'll
have somebody to talk to.'</p>

<p>'Huh! You'll have your Mahala.'</p>

<p>'Our Mahala is talented, but&mdash;well, she's too fond of
being coyly rebuking. No, honestly, I wouldn't go to the party at
all&mdash;champagne and the rumba and Corona-Coronas&mdash;except
to work up some carriage trade for the show.'</p>

<p>'I'm merely an understudy, Mr. Deacon!'</p>

<p>'Please don't be haughty.'</p>

<p>'But Andy, honestly, I haven't an evening dress. I will have,
as soon as I save up, and then&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Look, kitten, I'll take you out and buy you a frock tomorrow.
Shall we?'</p>

<p>'No, I'm afraid not.'</p>

<p>'I'd like to!'</p>

<p>'I couldn't wear anything I didn't earn. I'd feel&mdash;' She
didn't quite end up the sentence 'like an Iris.'</p>

<p>'I know, darling. And if this show goes over&mdash;as it
will!&mdash;maybe you'll have a big enough raise in salary to
earn twenty dresses, all gold and emeralds. Good night. I'll miss
you!' And he was gone with a kiss that&mdash;she wasn't quite
sure but that it had almost meant something.</p>

<p>She had a warm small happiness curled inside her then, and she
turned to find Doc Keezer looking on, friendly, only a little
sardonic. He said nothing about Andy's kiss; he merely yawned,
'Come on to the Yorkshire Grill and I'll buy you a bevy of
chops.'</p>

<p>It was consoling to walk the winter streets to the Grill with
Doc Keezer. He did not prance like Andy or Zed or Douglas Fry,
did not pour out plans to vanquish fairyland. He walked steadily,
held her arm steadily, knew exactly where he was going, waited
for the red light at street corners, and told her that on stage
she 'gargled her <i>l</i>'s too much', which was the most useful
thing anyone had said since Sol Gadto.</p>

<p>The Yorkshire Grill was an imitation of all the New York Chop
Houses that imitate Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, of London, which
imitates itself. Bethel was ashamed of her Lone Cinderella role
back at the theatre when she saw that there were plenty of other
members of the company who were not festive on first night.</p>

<p>At the Grill, Tudor Blackwall and Victor Swenson were sedately
eating Irish stew&mdash;'Oh, Bethel, <i>darling,</i> you were
too, too lovely to-night!' they chorused. Old Wyndham Nooks
(steak, rare) was telling Mrs. Golly, the wardrobe mistress
(deviled beef bone) of his early triumphs&mdash;early or not at
all. Bethel heard from him a trailing, 'So I said to Dave
Belasco, "Dave, I've got an idea that'll make a fortune for you",
and Dave said to me, "Wyndy, let's have it".' Douglas was
demonstrating to Vera Cross a ground plan for a new setting for
<i>Macbeth.</i></p>

<p>She was at home again, and comforted, and Doc Keezer ordered
chops, with bitter ale in pewter mugs, which, for the sake of her
well-loved Dickens and J. B. Priestley, she tried to enjoy, and
which for her own sake she thought was nasty.</p>

<p>'Get a wire from Fletch Hewitt to-night, Beth?' said Doc
Keezer.</p>

<p>'Yes. A nice one.'</p>

<p>'You're the kind of young woman, chick, neither too maternal
nor too grasping, with a career but not willing to step on
everybody to get it, that'll always have good, steady, dull dogs
like Hewitt and Charley Hatch hanging around you, claiming they
want to support you, but really wanting to be supported
mentally.'</p>

<p>'How did you ever know anything about Charley Hatch?'</p>

<p>'I watched him when he came to visit you at Grampion. An old
unmarried trouper like me&mdash;oh, I was married for about a
year one time, when I was a hoofer; but she liked Italian
orchestra leaders with moustaches&mdash;most of us get to be
great hermits, and as tightwad as a Yankee character
actor&mdash;walk twenty blocks out of the way to find a hotel
room that smells more of old carpets and costs fifty cents less a
night. And we sit off one side backstage and nurse our arms, and
prob'ly we only know our own parts, and never find out whether
Juliet marries the apothecary or Prince Escalus at the end of the
play.</p>

<p>'But we do get a kind of compensation: we study the people
around us, all the time, and get to know 'em. I know you better
than Andy does, or young Wintergeist or any of 'em. They think
you're a lively kid, pretty naive yet, but sweet. I know you're a
serious student&mdash;maybe you'll never be a great actress, but
you'll be a dependable one, if the luck runs with you. Ergal, you
ought to count a lot more on me than on those young
flibbertigibbets&mdash;who I also know them better than you do.
Andy is better'n ninety-five per cent of Rich Young Men. But if
he doesn't make a ten strike at play producing quick, it'll be a
wonder if he doesn't go back to his gardener and his butler.
Wintergeist has ability. <i>If</i> he stays clear of booze and
gold diggers. He's the kind that's born drunk, and born in love,
and just one extra drink or one more girl will send him
haywire.'</p>

<p>'But Doc, if you're disposing of 'em, what about the boys I
really like&mdash;Douglas Fry and Harry Purvis?'</p>

<p>'Two light-waisted, both of 'em. And too self-satisfied. But
there is a lot bigger threat.'</p>

<p>'Eh?'</p>

<p>'What you have to watch out for is your own friendly heart,
and it makes you feel responsible to the Steady Old
Dogs&mdash;the home-town boys&mdash;Fletcher and Hatch... and
me.'</p>

<p>'Oh!'</p>

<p>'Yes. Haven't you sort of noticed that in my methodical aged
way, I've been falling in love with you, Bethel?'</p>

<p>'Oh no. Oh, Doc&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I know, dear. I know all the lines. I've played 'em in Clyde
Fitch and Charles Klein: You just felt that we were good friends.
That you could depend on me. Can't it remain like that?... And
it can, dear. I hope it will. I'm too old and too lazy to go and
get lyric on you. I won't write you one single
triolet&mdash;that's its name, ain't it? I'll always be
here&mdash;holding the gloves and buying you hot dogs, and
sending you home to bed early&mdash;and alone. But if you ever
should get sick of these galloping young men, you might some day
get interested in an old ham that's gone through about all the
rough weather there is, and come out pretty cheerful, and even
reasonably kind and honest&mdash;which is all the flowers I'm
ever going to hand myself. Posi<i>tive</i>ly! And a fellow pro
that would nurse your career and guide you and cue you&mdash;and
of course the only reason any sensible actress ever gets married
is to have somebody cue her.</p>

<p>'And as to what you would do for me&mdash;well, it would give
me a youth I never really had.'</p>

<p>'How old are you, Doc? Please forgive me&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Sure. I'm fifty, last month. And you're twenty-two. I know
all the arguments about May versus December&mdash;the poor kid
sitting at home when she wants to go dancing, because Pop loves
his pipe and slippers&mdash;though nowadays, seems like it's just
the opposite: Pop wants to be out doing the rumba with the
cuties, the old fool, and his girl wants to stay home and study
her admiralty law. But when a couple are together, in the same
art, like acting, or the same profession, then maybe age don't
matter as much. You don't get along with Wintergeist just because
he's only a year or a couple years older, but because you're
playing his page. And that's all on the subject. Have a brandy?... No? I think I will, if you don't mind. Say, did you hear old
Nooks squawking to-night? The steam pipes in his dressing-room
were leaking....'</p>

<p>She looked over at Vera Cross and Douglas Fry, young and
credulous. Youth seemed to her not a quality, but an objective
thing, not rosy-cheeked, as they said, and robust, but fragile
and ardently to be protected and preserved.</p>

<p>And then the young Carl Frazee, of the <i>Evening News,</i>
came charging up.</p>

<p>'There you are, Beth&mdash;I've been looking in every joint in
town for you.'</p>

<p>And then she was young, too; a child escaped from the house on
Sunday afternoon when Aunty Bess and Gramma have come visiting,
and blessedly invited to a good, wholesome, violent game of cops
and robbers.</p>

<p>'Did you give us a good review?' begged Bethel.</p>

<p>'Not ethics to ask, young Juliet. But I don't think you'll
kick much, when you see it to-morrow.'</p>

<p>Carl had, instantly, Douglas, Vera, Tudor, Swenson about him,
as well as Bethel and Doc Keezer. He effervescently told them
that they were all (he included himself, and Tudor, who was
thirty-five) young and brave and missionaries of culture. (As
Carl shouted, Bethel was very pleased about it, and would have
gone on touring in Shakespeare if she had had to walk.) They were
more important than all the college presidents and bishops and
gross newspaper owners&mdash;God what a stinker <i>his</i> boss
was!&mdash;in the world. And Lord but did it save his (Carl's)
life, when a real theatrical troupe came to this jungle, where
you were expected to report the speeches of bathtub barons and
the Da Vincis of insulated piping.</p>

<p>Yawning, Doc Keezer arose.</p>

<p>'Well, I'll leave you infants to build a chain of theatres.
Just let me have a job. Will you see the baby here gets home
safe, Carl?'</p>

<p>When Doc was gone, Bethel said defensively, 'He's really
sweet. He's my Friar Laurence.'</p>

<p>'Look&mdash;look&mdash;something I want to ask
you&mdash;c'm'ere,' yelled Carl, and dragged her out to the
vestibule. He was only a little crazy. 'Don't you make any
mistake about Doc Keezer!'</p>

<p>'I don't. He's safe as houses.'</p>

<p>'You're telling me! He prob'ly thinks the whole gang of us are
a bunch of chicks who want to tell the old hens what a swell
place a barnyard is, and he's prob'ly right. He's a professional.
He'll put on a good show the night you play Arroyo City in a
blizzard, yes, and old Ma Boyle will, too, when your Andy blows
higher than a kite, and Mahala won't leave the hotel, and you, my
precious, are too scared to speak. My guess, from the way you
look at Andy, is that you're in love with him&mdash;or will be.
But I'll bet that before this tour is over&mdash;and it'll last
at least two years, no doubt of that&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You honestly think so?'</p>

<p>'I know it! You'll play clear out to L.A., and then prob'ly
Australia.'</p>

<p>'That would be glorious.'</p>

<p>'Yuh, and before it's over, you'll marry Doc Keezer&mdash;I've
see <i>him</i> look at <i>you.</i> You two will have an abandoned
farm house in Connecticut, you and Doc, and I'll come stay with
you, and Doc and I will write a play together&mdash;he'll supply
all stagecrafts&mdash;exits are the <i>damnedest</i> things, in
my experience!&mdash;and you'll star in it. But what a time I'm
going to have keeping myself from taking you away from him, when
the play is finished. What a wow the play's going to be&mdash;and
you too, I mean. Come on, come on, urchin, we can't keep those
people waiting all night, you know, and I want to tell Doug about
how to stage a Carlo van Loo comedy!'</p>

<p>And by this strident egotism of Youth, it is regretfully to be
reported that Bethel was not shocked at all.</p>

<p><br>
When Carl escorted her home&mdash;talking&mdash;he insisted on
peeping into the Pocahontas Room of the Buckingham-Bradley, an
affair of black-and-gold tiled walls, and lights that shifted
from rose to saffron to green, and the smart young things of
Belluca moving smoothly and slowly in what they thought to be a
dance. And instantly she saw Iris moving so with Zed; they were
cheek to cheek, and Iris's head was tilted back, her eyes closed,
her eyelids like little mounds of pale blue silk.</p>

<p>The wordly wise Carl Frazee followed her look, and
pontificated, 'And thank God, in marrying you Doc will keep you
from ever falling for that guy Wintergeist there, who's too
bumptious to live. Modesty is <i>so</i> important, don't you
think?'</p>

<p>'Oh <i>yes!</i>' said the young Bethel.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN the enterprising city of Belluca, the
'morning' papers appeared at ten-thirty the night before, the
'evening' papers at ten in the morning. The company had an
informal invitation to be in Andy's suite in the Buckingham at
ten on the morning after the opening, to see the reviews by Carl
Frazee and Ted Gronitz in the <i>Evening News</i> and <i>Daily
Republican,</i> and Tertius Tully had promised to wangle an
advance proof from the <i>Morning Herald,</i> which would be of
supreme importance (Tertius explained) because it would be by
Professor Stanley Thrush, of the English Department of the
University of Belluca.</p>

<p>Though of course (explained Tertius, to whom any company that
he was managing, whether it was Sally Rand or the Lunts, was more
important than the conquest of Europe and almost as important as
the circuses that were his real boyhood love), each of the others
was also of international importance, because Carl Frazee was a
young genius, and Ted Gronitz, with his radio audience,
remarkably like the President.</p>

<p>As she dressed, sleepily and by no means with a Sladesbury
neatness, Bethel cried to the dozing Iris, 'Come on; we're due in
Andy's apartment, to hear the death sentence.'</p>

<p>'E-uu-uu-uu-uu! I'm so sleepy. You skip along. I'm going to
Zed's room, to read the reviews with him and Jeff Hoy and Tony
Murphy,' yawned Iris.</p>

<p>In her voice there was to Bethel the sound of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Since when had Iris become so intimate with Geoffrey
Hoy&mdash;Benvolio&mdash;that glass-haired, courteous, competent
incognito-minded actor? With Antonio Murphy, that surly
comedian?</p>

<p>Bethel felt troubled and incompetent as she trailed up to
Andy's rooms, and to a litter of dressing-gowns, coffee, Mrs.
Boyle, brocade mules, shaving lather, marmalade, proofs of
advertisements, Wyndham Nooks talking about himself, Charlotte
Levison insisting on lending the latest copy of the <i>New
Masses</i> to Hugh Challis, sweaters and orange juice. Andy was,
rather astonishingly, already dressed, fresh-looking in grey
flannel; he beamed at her like one who rode the world, and began
reading from the papers that a bellboy was bringing in as she
arrived.</p>

<br>

<p>Mr Carl Frazee in the Belluca <i>Evening News</i>:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">Will Shakespeare, who is, I understand, a
country boy from Stratford, is the most promising young
playwright in the theatre to-day. More plays by him are being
seen on Broadway and out here, where the tall corn grows, than by
Clifford Odets or Sidney Kingsley. And to the most important of
Will's recent successes, to the Gielgud and Evans Hamlets, Orson
Welles's Julius Caesar, and the little Globe Theatre at the
Chicago World's Fair, and if you missed that you missed something
good, must now be distinctly added the highly meritorious Andrew
Deacon version of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> in modern clothes,
starring Mrs. Lumley Boyle, which honoured Belluca and honoured
the renascent theatre in America, last evening, by holding its
world premiere here, at our historic American Theatre, which in
past days has seen so much of beauty and eloquence.<br> <br>
Belluca may well be proud of this recognition of its position as
a first-class theatre town, and we welcome Mr. Deacon and Mrs.
Boyle not only because of the favour to our home town but because
they are putting out beyond any question an absolutely first-
class show and stirring entertainment.</p>

<p class="quote">... magic of Mrs. Boyle who must certainly be
only sixteen no matter what the reference books say... Deacon
a charming and romantic Romeo bringing the sad old tale to an
exciting rebirth and showing himself a fine actor... comedy
well stressed in the characters of Peter and the Nurse by...
first moment of shock you were glad to have them in recognizable
latter-day clothes instead of the conventional tights, and as for
the excellent scenery it is enough to say... in two girls
Bethel Merriday and Iris Pentire, found real treasures from whom
much will be heard in the future. Miss Merriday gave the prologue
and epilogue in such a fresh, winning young voice....</p>

<br>

<p>'That young man writes with a hoe,' said Mrs. Boyle.</p>

<p>'Ye'es, but he does like us,' said Andy.</p>

<p>'Means money in the box office,' said Tertius Tully, who had
come in with the advance proof from the <i>Herald.</i></p>

<p><br>
Mr. Ted Gronitz, in the <i>Daily Republican:</i></p>

<p class="quote">Mr. Shakespeare may not have turned over in his
cement coffin yestdy eveng, but he certainly didn't feel so
hot.<br> <br> We're supposed to be all hot &amp; bothered by gt
honour bestowed on our poor hick bible-belt bivouac by having
sure-nuff Bwy show open here, but your column reports we better
still count on our watch-export &amp; baseball record for
Belluca's rep.<br> <br> The bard's <i>Romeo &amp; Juliet</i> was
pulled off in soup &amp; fish last night, at the American
Theatre. Results: no hits, no runs, plenty errors.</p>

<p class="quote">Hokum in ice-cream pants looks just like hokum

<p class="quote">Mrs. Boyle, from dear ole Lunnon&mdash;quit now,
I didn't say anything about her having known Queen Liz
personally&mdash;is a pretty good Model T Juliet. Deacon, though
this column will report that personally and at the bar he is a
good guy, reads Romeo like he did back in freshman year in
Yale.</p>

<p class="quote">The other boys and girls will be happier when
they get back to the shoestore and the tea shoppe.</p>

<p class="quote">Except for a new Thesp named Zed Wintergeist,
who is a wiz, and plays Mercutio like Hellzapoppin instead of
like a Vassar daisy chain.</p>

<br>

<p>'Aurelia, with what sort of implement did you say the other
young gentleman wrote?' said Hugh Challis to Mrs. Boyle.</p>

<p>'Shut up,' said Mrs. Boyle.</p>

<p>'That hurt&mdash;that hurt plenty,' said Andy.</p>

<p>Charlotte looked as though she were crying inside her eyes.
Bethel was unable to be so restrained. Mahala and Lyle Johnson
simultaneously said, 'The son&mdash;of&mdash;a&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But here! This one is swell,' said Tertius Tully, as he
handed the proof sheet to Andy.</p>

<p><br>
Professor Stanley Thrush (B.A., St. Stephen's College, Ph.D.,
University of Michigan), in the <i>Morning Herald</i>:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">With an apprehension due less, perhaps, to
conservatism in belles-lettres than to past observations of a too
frequent confusion of artistic innovation with technical
slovenliness, the more literate acolytes of the drama edged into
the American Theatre, last evening, stoutly prepared for
catastrophe in the spectacle of a presentation&mdash;announced as
the first ever beheld&mdash;of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> in
contemporary costume. Their delight was, perhaps, the keener when
they encountered a sound and beautiful production of the great
romance... Mr. Deacon played Romeo not only as a gifted mime
but as a gentleman... Boyle a lovely Juliet in the tradition
of Julia Marlowe... studied naivety of Miss Merriday, our
Prologue, with her eagerness and charm, gave a promise of an
evening of youth and sentiment which was generously fulfilled.
The only player to be gently castigated is a Mr. Zed Wintergeist,
who doubtless means well but who depends less on subtlety than on
brawling and blather and who made it grossly evident that he felt
superior to the manly, graceful and sincere bearing of Mr. Andrew
Deacon. In a word, we shall certainly go to this show again this
week while we have the chance.</p>

<br>

<p>Andy kissed Mrs. Boyle, Mahala and Bethel.</p>

<p>Lyle Johnson kissed Charlotte and Vera Cross.</p>

<p>Doc Keezer kissed Bethel.</p>

<p>Bethel said, 'Shan't I phone down and order some waffles?' and
everybody, amazed, cried, 'Oh yes, that would be a wonderful
idea.'</p>

<p>Andy said, 'I hope Zed never sees Thrush's slam,' and Bethel
loved him for his generosity. But he exploded then: 'No, I hope
he does see it&mdash;plenty. It'll be good for that young man!'
And so Bethel loved him for his attacks of humanness.</p>

<p><br>
The house was nearly sold out every night that week, at both
matin&eacute;es there were 'standees', and the company felt
virtuous and powerful. They stayed for half an hour after the
play on Wednesday evening, sitting on prop trunks and segments of
stairways and on the floor, while Adrian Satori, who for two days
had been giving to all of them little copperplate last notes of
criticism, said good-bye:</p>

<p>'Ladies and gentlemen, I feel that my job as director is done;
I feel pretty well satisfied; I'm off for New York tonight; and I
turn you over to Andy&mdash;and to yourselves. You're most of you
pretty good&mdash;though there isn't one of you who can't improve
if he, and especially she, will just sit down and try to think
what the characters that you are playing are feeling and
thinking. That's all, boys and girls. You go forth into the great
world, standing with reluctant feet where the brook and river
meet, and God keep you from the critics and the room clerks and
the autograph fiends!'</p>

<p>Andy took over with a hearty and optimistic address to the
company.</p>

<p>It was, felt Bethel, a real Yale pep talk. It smelled of the
football-squad quarters, of sweat and childishness. He was so
very sweet about it, and so affectionate, and she was embarrassed
to the point of itching.</p>

<p>'Fellow troupers, I've really got nothing to say,' he
explained, and went ahead and said it for ten minutes... while
Bethel irritably watched Zed leer sidewise at Tony Murphy. 'Our
prospects for a smash-hit tour are better than good. My advices
from the next towns on our route, Treverton and Paddock and
Milwaukee and Madison, look swell, especially in party bookings.
Now all I want to say is that I'm here to help any of you any way
I can, twenty-four hours a day.</p>

<p>'I know you're all of you right on your toes, rarin' to go,
and while I won't say anything about what I think of the artistic
merits of our production&mdash;I guess you can guess how I feel
about that&mdash;I do want to say that I'm proud there's one
company where the manager isn't going off to Europe but is going
to stay right with the job and with you, and where we're all
working together, cards on the table, and there isn't one single
feud or clique....'</p>

<p>And all the while Zed was maliciously smiling.</p>

<p><br>
On Thursday morning, with Nathan Eldred, the stage manager,
directing, there was held in the lobby the first understudy
rehearsal. Bethel for the first time was Juliet; Iris was
alternately the Nurse and Lady Montague; Vera Cross was Lady
Capulet; Eldred himself was the older men, and Tom Wherry
demonstrated that he was equally unsure of his lines as Romeo,
Mercutio, Tybalt, Benvolio and Balthasar. It was, indeed, a
fairly complete mess, and Bethel thudded abruptly from pride in
herself as Prologue to terror about herself as Juliet.</p>

<p>She had been placidly sure that she knew every word, and
perhaps she did, but when Wherry-Romeo threw a line at her (after
agitatedly finding the right place in his typed part, and
coughing, and scraping his right foot, and beginning with 'Uh-hh-
hh'), she didn't know a word in answer.</p>

<p>There was nothing in her skull but a dun-coloured chaos. She
discovered that learning lines and keeping them learned have no
especial relationship. A long speech, like 'Thou know'st the mask
of night is on my face'&mdash;oh, she started it ever so
brightly, but the rest of the passage was blank.
'Else&mdash;else&mdash;' Oh, what <i>did</i> come after that? She
sat hunched and agonized till Eldred, a little bored, gave her
the line, grunting, 'Else would a maiden'. She rushed
triumphantly on with 'blush bepaint my cheek'&mdash;and all she
knew of the rest was a large dazzling nothing.</p>

<p>But when they had gone through the first act, it had all come
back to her.</p>

<p>'You kids know this stuff all right, if you'd just let
yourself. You're scared of being scared. Now relax,' mumbled
Eldred.</p>

<p>They, the juveniles, the future hopes of the stage, had come
into the lobby for the rehearsal high-stepping and babbling,
ready to show up poor old Mrs. Boyle and Challis and Hoy. Now
they hunched over on silly little gilt chairs and suffered.</p>

<p>It was all fine.</p>

<p>'Good first understudy rehearsal. Some of you know some of the
lines. Call for next Thursday, same hour&mdash;that'll be in
Paddock, Illinois.'</p>

<p><br>
On Tuesday evening, as Bethel and she walked to the theatre,
Iris stopped at a jeweller's window and pointed to an elaborate
mechanism to be carried by ladies for the repair of an evening's
ravages. It was in enamel, orange with streaks of black, and it
combined a vanity case, a cigarette case, a lighter and a
miniature clock, of which latter two it was improbable that they
would work.</p>

<p>'Isn't that cute?' moaned Iris. 'Gee, I wish I had it.'</p>

<p>'You've already got all that junk&mdash;three compacts and two
cigarette cases,' said the prosaic, provincial Bethel.</p>

<p>'But this is the newest thing there is.'</p>

<p>'Hm. Like Charlotte's newest thing in the Communist party
line. I'm just getting surrounded by novelties.'</p>

<p>'I don't know what you mean. But this combination
compact&mdash;' Iris chilled her elegant little nose against the
shop window. 'Lookit! They call it the "Demoiselle's D-e-l-i-t-
e"&mdash;"delight", I guess that must be. Oh, that's a cunning
name, isn't it! So amusing. I bet it comes right straight from
Paris. Think of finding it out here in the sticks!' marvelled the
daughter of Wheeling. 'Oh, travel and learn, I always say. I just
got to have this. It's so sweet and original. I noticed it
yesterday afternoon, and I dreamed about it last night. When we
were dancing last night, after the opening, oh, we had a swell
time, I told Zed Wintergeist about it&mdash;'</p>

<p>Bethel winced.</p>

<p>'&mdash;but he didn't seem interested. I don't know what I'm
going to do. And it only costs twenty-five dollars.'</p>

<p>'Well, buy it then, if you want it so much.'</p>

<p>'Me? I haven't a cent. And I've got to pay up <i>some</i> of
my debts back in New York&mdash;people do get so mean about
things like that. Oh dear. Well, come <i>on</i>! Do you want us
to be late?'</p>

<p>Wednesday, walking to the matin&eacute;e, Bethel saw Iris and
Zed stop at that jewellery window, and as she passed them, heard
Iris say indignantly to Zed, 'You know I've <i>told</i> you, I
don't allow <i>any</i> gentlemen to give me presents, not even
innocent ones like this&mdash;isn't it just too
<i>darling!'</i></p>

<p>After the matin&eacute;e, Bethel saw Andy, after certain
whisperings, hand over to Zed two bank notes.</p>

<p>That evening, when Iris and Bethel were dressing to go out to
dinner&mdash;cross and touchy after the between-performances
nap&mdash;a bellboy delivered a package for Iris. Anything
wrapped in tissue paper excited Iris. Squealing, she scrabbled
with the wrappings and took out the black-and-orange compact.</p>

<p>She hugged it to her breast, crooning, as though it were a
baby. She took out the card, read its inscription, blushed, and
looked at Bethel with sly triumph that changed&mdash;an excellent
performance before an audience of only one&mdash;into indignant
innocence.</p>

<p>And Bethel did not dare to speak.</p>

<p>Iris and Zed left the theatre together that evening, following
Satori's farewell, and Iris did not come home till after three.
Bethel awoke to cock an eye at her and, as Iris was obviously
waiting for a scene, she had a small solid pleasure in not giving
it to her. At breakfast, which Iris had tempted her into the
wasteful luxury of having in their room, Bethel was inspired to
attack.</p>

<p>'Iris!'</p>

<p>'Eh?'</p>

<p>'Why did you coax Zed into giving you that compact?'</p>

<p>'Who said he gave it to me?'</p>

<p>'Why did you coax him&mdash;tease him&mdash;gold-dig him, if
you like it that way!'</p>

<p>'Why, I never heard of such an outrageous accusation in all my
life! Me coax him? Me tease him? Me gold-dig anybody? Let me tell
you, Beth Merriday, I've had rich men, oh, very rich, beg for the
chance to give me&mdash;uh&mdash;jewels and French perfume and
hatboxes and everything, and I always said, certainly not, no one
can buy my favours, and they said, why no, of course not, they
just wanted to show their appreciation of me, but even so, no, I
told them, a beautiful girl in my position where you haven't got
a father or a brother or anybody to defend you, you've just got
to be beyond criticism, I told them, and my reputation was just
as dear to me as it was to Helen Hayes or a banker or
anybody&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why did you make Zed buy that junk for you? You didn't need
it!'</p>

<p>Iris was suddenly snarling. 'And why shouldn't he? He's the
damnedest tightwad in the company! Oh, he wants everything he can
get, all right, and when it's convenient to <i>him,</i> but you
have to throw a fit to even get him to buy you a champagne
cocktail!'</p>

<p>'Iris! Stop it! He hasn't much more money than we have. He
isn't much older than we are. He's a baby. He seems grown up
because he knows so much and is so conceited, but he's a mere
baby. You might save your wiles&mdash;'</p>

<p>'My what?'</p>

<p>'Your wiles.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean, <i>wiles?'</i></p>

<p>'I'll admit it's a bad word. It's rafained. Like you! Call it
your gutter tricks, then.'</p>

<p>'I never in my life&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It's none of my business. I hardly know whether I hate Zed or
love him. He's the measles. But he's good active measles, anyway.
He really loves the theatre. He'll do something with it. And it
makes me sick to see you hanging on to him&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I am not, and you know it!'</p>

<p>'&mdash;and to think that because I room with you, maybe
Zed'll think&mdash;and Andy'll think and Hugh Challis&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why don't you bring in your doddering boy friend Doc Keezer,
too, while you're about it!'</p>

<p>'I do! I certainly do! Doc is the squarest, kindest man in the
whole company, except maybe Andy! And I don't want him, or any of
'em, to think that I'm a sponge like you, just because I have to
be with you a lot.'</p>

<p>'You don't have to, you know.'</p>

<p>'Yes, that was the idea I was working around to myself!'</p>

<p><br>
She walked alone, that Thursday morning, to the understudy
rehearsal which has already been recorded, and it was no comfort
to her that Iris, trained in stock, should know her understudy
lines. That afternoon she moved to a single room at the
Buckingham. It was exhilarating to have her own clear,
uncluttered place in which she could breathe, and after she had
duly puzzled over whether she had been priggish with Iris, and
brawled like a market woman, she asserted, 'I don't care', and
felt lonely and happy.</p>

<p>She wanted to tell Zed of Iris's depths of calculated
depravity&mdash;and expensiveness&mdash;but she was no informer,
and she felt that that brash young man deserved what he got...
and she suspected that he wouldn't listen to her. She said
nothing about Iris when Zed and she were sent out to the Belluca
University Theatre, on Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>Andy Deacon, backed by his weighty local cousin, was doing in
Belluca all the brisk, desperate, publicity-cadging tricks which,
in the Age of Rotogravure, were supposed to lure disciples to the
sweets of the drama. Andy gave interviews, was photographed
holding a pipe, holding a copy of Shakespeare, holding Mrs.
Boyle; he talked daily on the radio&mdash;trying craftily to
insinuate into a discourse on the Globe Theatre the fact that we
may be seen right here in town to-night at the American Theatre,
top two-eighty.</p>

<p>He was manly and athletic at luncheons of the Rotary Club and
the Belluca Athletic Club; he was manly and boyish and romantic
at the Women's Drama League tea and, with Bethel, Mahala and
Charlotte supporting him, did not blench till the very end of a
receiving line of one hundred and seventy-six women with whom he
shook hands as they maternally murmured to him, 'I'm so glad
you're Doing Shakespeare. My husband and I do hope we'll have
time to run in and see you this week, though of course we're
awfully busy and there's a bridge tournament on'.</p>

<p>Hugh Challis entertained the Drama League, the Tomawattis Club
Monthly Literary Luncheon and the English-Speaking Union with
anecdotes of Henry Irving, Disraeli's favourite horse and the
Duke of Windsor. Lyle Johnson rushed over to the City Auditorium
during a scene in which he did not appear and presented a silver
cup to the winner of the Boy Scout Hurdle Contest&mdash;a stunt
which Andy had approved, though Tertius Tully, the procurer of
the other personal appearances, had fretted that the Boy Scouts
and their doggone hurdling were nothing but Competition for the
Show.</p>

<p>Henry Purvis resumed his Ph.D. and addressed the Geographic
Club of St. Aloysius College on 'The History and Significance of
the Oberammergau Passion Play', Jeff Hoy and Tony Murphy sang
duets at a smoker of the Bathtub Executives' Club, Tudor
Blackwall dedicated the new Swiss Knitwork Department in Burpling
&amp; Blum's Department Store, and Wyndham Nooks, entirely
without Tertius Tully's sanction, was found to have given
(gratis) a programme of 'Great Moments from Shakespeare' at a
six-o'clock Get Together Supper of the Wisconsin
Association&mdash;it was reported that, with a beard handy in his
pocket, he turned himself from a Prince in the Tower to King Lear
in ten seconds.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Boyle refused to go out soliciting at all. Between
shows she slept, and wrote letters home to England, and
encouraged Hilda Donnersberg, her maid, to tell her how bad Andy
and Mahala and Charlotte and Mabel Staghorn were.</p>

<p>As part of this campaign, Tertius Tully sent the reluctant Zed
and Bethel to represent Shakespeare at tea at the Belluca
University Theatre, at five on Friday.</p>

<p>As they rode out on the East Philadelphia Avenue &amp;
University Heights bus, they were annoyed.</p>

<p>'It makes me tired, having to go out and be arty with a bunch
of college actors that don't know a ground cloth from a grommet.
I wanted to go to the St. Louis Symphony concert this afternoon
and see the Chinese stuff in the Art Museum,' complained Zed, a
tireless explorer of new towns. 'It'll be awful. They'll all ask
us&mdash;they don't get a chance at real professional actors very
often, and they'll ask us how they can get on the stage on
Broadway, and Do we do our own make-up, and Don't we meet such
interesting people in our dressing-rooms! The theatre will be a
hall over the horse-doctoring laboratory, and we'll be expected
to admire an eighteen-foot stage with a hand roll drop. To ask
actors to do a thing like this! Artistic slumming! Andy Deacon is
a travelling salesman for the drama.'</p>

<p>'He is not&mdash;but it will be dreadful,' said Bethel. 'I
remember my own college plays. But maybe we'll meet some wide-
awake young professors. I hear these Middle Western colleges are
so progressive.'</p>

<p>'You think so, do you! You read our review in the
<i>Herald,</i> didn't you, by Professor Stanley Thrush, of the
university, the old songbird? There ought to be a law.'</p>

<p>'How old are you really, Zed?'</p>

<p>'Twenty-three. What's that got to do with it?'</p>

<p>'Baby!'</p>

<p>'I was more perceptive at six than old Thrush and the whole
gang of Belluca profs are at sixty-six, which is probably their
average age. Well, here we are at the business college. We'll
probably be greeted by twenty-one rah-rah-rahs and the chief
artistic nucleus of the university&mdash;the glee club, singing
"Down on the Bingo Farm". And Thrush will be swanking around,
looking benevolently amused. I hope I won't be rude to
him&mdash;I don't really <i>like</i> to be so rude to stuffed
shirts&mdash;not <i>too</i> rude.'</p>

<p><br>
She had never made a quantitative analysis of the relationship
of ivy to education, but from observation of Point Royal and
Yale, she had concluded that it was direct. The Point Royal
buildings were, perhaps, pretty ugly: of bumpy brown sandstone,
and given to arched windows with clotted glass, but they dripped
with ivy, and so that must be necessary. The Belluca University
buildings, ivyless and of a correct and uninspired No. 32A Tudor,
seemed to her like factories, and the trees were anaemic, the
turf was scraggly.</p>

<p>Before they had time to ask for the way to the theatre, they
came to a pillared, white-limestone structure with the
inscription 'McCoggins Memorial Theatre' on the pediment. (A Mr.
McCoggins, third-generation manufacturer of machinery, who had
loved Maude Adams and William Gillette more than cream
separators, had left to the new university a million
dollars.)</p>

<p>'Have they got a whole building to themselves?' said Zed,
uneasily.</p>

<p>In the formal, black-and-white marble lobby they asked for
Professor Mattocks, the Director of Productions. They were shown
into a too luxurious office, with tapestry chairs and a table of
magazines with diagrams and coloured photographs.</p>

<p>'Professor Mattocks. Sounds like a funeral. Worse than Stanley
Thrush,' grumbled Zed, turning his sodden brown felt hat.</p>

<p>In on them charged a man not over thirty, a man of Zed's own
rough, driving, intellectual type, with the same pretentious
simplicity, as exhibited in flannel shirt and wrinkled trousers,
paint-spattered. He was a flaming sun of welcome. 'Miss Merriday?
Mr. Wintergeist? We were terribly pleased when Mr. Tully said you
might come. Tickled to death! I'm Bill Mattocks.'</p>

<p>'Fine!' Zed swiftly looked him over, then grinned and
demanded, confidentially, as one alley pup to another, 'When do
we meet Prof Thrush?'</p>

<p>'Cheer up. You don't. They keep him on ice, over in the
English Department. His only connection with our theatre is to
lecture to all the women's clubs in the state about how crude and
subversive we are. We're all apologetic as hell to you for his
review of <i>Romeo.</i> We thought you were a brilliant Mercutio,
something fabulous, and we liked your prologue, Miss
Merriday&mdash;we'll be waiting for you when you get a real part.
Don't for God's sake blame Thrush on me! I've played and directed
summer and winter stock, and I toured with Miss Cornell in
<i>Romeo</i> and Miss Hayes in <i>Victoria.</i> We're theatre
workers, not academic phonographs.'</p>

<p><br>
They had coffee and cakes with a dozen university actors and
directors and scene designers, in the green room, which was
actually green, beneath the stage. Three of them were teachers,
the rest students, but they could not easily be told apart.</p>

<p>The whole group seemed to Bethel to have one sharp, common
characteristic: they were all akin to Zed and to Bill Mattocks
(who were already first-naming each other as though they had been
intimates for years) in being revolutionary and youthful.</p>

<p>Some of them, she thought, worked at their revolution a little
too hard and a little too obviously. They felt it a duty to have
their trousers and their khaki shirts very wrinkled and very
spotty, their ties either greasy or orange-coloured, and one even
displayed a horrid little canvas hat with autographs of his
fellow souls penned on it. In hatred of the staleness of their
homes, some of these children would jump into the hysterical,
pseudo-artistic half-world. But that had always been the chromo-
coloured fault of every Quartier Latin, and these
experimentalists, she felt, unlike some of the quack doctors of
dramaturgy whom she had met in left-wing theatrical circles in
New York, had enough gaiety and salutary cynicism to inoculate
them against cults.</p>

<p>And then they got beyond her entirely.</p>

<p>The proud professional Bethel, who had heard Sol Gadto talk
about Stanislavski, and Adrian Satori tell how Lunt and Fontanne
rehearsed, was stunned now by a babble about Meyerhold's
productions in Moscow, and Nimerovitch-Danchenko's, about Louis
Jouvet's pioneering in Paris, about the Gaston Baty version of
<i>Crime and Punishment</i> at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Montparnasse, about Piscator in the dead great days in
Berlin.</p>

<p>It was an almost respectful young Mr. Wintergeist who, with
Bethel, followed Mattocks on a tour of the theatre: huge stage,
auditorium and lounge with murals by Grant Wood and Tom Benton,
dressing-rooms with full-length mirrors surrounded with electric
globes in every colour that stage lights could give; workshop
with a paint frame, so that the scenic artist could stand up,
instead of, like Bethel at Grampion, sitting on the floor,
sitting on the canvas flat, or lying on it, while trying to do
feather strokes with a ponderous paintbrush.</p>

<p><br>
They sat, Zed and Bethel, on a bench on the campus.</p>

<p>Zed spoke with a curious meekness: 'Beth, do you realize that
that university theatre is probably better equipped than any on
Broadway? That it has a thirty-eight-foot revolving stage, and a
plaster horizont that's actually portable, and a Pre-Selective
Remote Control Board, the very latest Von Kleybourg model? You
saw that?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes,' said Bethel, who hadn't.</p>

<p>'I tell you, those boys give me a new faith in the theatre. I
do believe in Broadway. I don't believe the endowed stage is as
real as one that has to fight for its life. But let me tell you
that if Broadway closed up entirely, if the Fabulous Invalid
finally kicks the bucket, there'll be a new theatre coming out of
these universities. That's exciting. Universities actually
creating something, and not just teaching boys to write
advertising and sell bonds and hold patients' hands. But why not?
That's what Oxford and Cambridge did, when the monks kept
civilization alive. Oh, I've never been so hopeful of the living
theatre, never been so proud of my profession and so glad I
picked it out and stuck to it. Now I'm dead sure that not even
Hollywood and the radio and an education formed by the comic
strips can kill the drama&mdash;which is as old as religion.
But&mdash;'</p>

<p>He took her hand, he held it tight, almost as though he were
seeking protection, and he spoke humbly:</p>

<p>'But I certainly got mine. Beth. Pet. Do you mind kicking me,
to-night, after the show, when we'll have plenty of time for it?
I went in there feeling so superior. I thought those collitch
boys would just be another bunch of rah-rah Andys or, at best,
learned sots like Harry Purvis. But these kids really study.
Isn't that something&mdash;to find learning in an institution of
learning! Maybe America really is growing up... But it was
hard on me! I've read a lot about Piscator, but I didn't know
much about Baty and Jouvet. Not a thing. Was my face red!'</p>

<p>'I didn't know anything about 'em, either.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but you've never gone around being a bright new genius
of the theatre, like Comrade Wintergeist, pet! Forgive me. No.
There's no use. I'll be just as bumptious to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'You're never bumptious... really. You're just eager.'</p>

<p>'Am I? Well, maybe. Anyway, you were the perfect companion to
see that stuff with to-day. Now you take Iris&mdash;'</p>

<p>Bethel flinched. She did not want to take Iris, particularly
not just now.</p>

<p>'Don't jump so, darling,' he said. 'I know you think Iris is
dumb. She isn't really. She doesn't know anything, not with her
brains. But she has magic.'</p>

<p>'Has she?'</p>

<p>'Yes. She'd be ridiculous, with a bunch like that over there.
She'd probably tell Bill Mattocks that she went to swimming
classes with Jouvet, and taught Piscator how to play polo, and
showed Mordecai Gorelik how to paint light.'</p>

<p>'And that Meyerhold insisted on giving her that new vanity
case, because he admired her mastery of Russian!'</p>

<p>'Wait! Whoa! Let's look at you!' Zed dropped her hand, seized
her shoulders, swung her halfway around, so that he could pierce
her look. 'Iris was telling me you went and got pure on her, and
even moved out on her, because I insisted on giving her a little
token of affection.'</p>

<p>'Insisted?'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;practically. Look here, pet. When I first met you,
I told you I could get interested in you.'</p>

<p>She was adequately angry. 'Not really? Not the great Maestro
Wintergeist? In a poor apprentice?'</p>

<p>'Yes, and maybe he <i>is</i> the great Maestro, too! I'll
admit those university sharks know more than I do about the new
European technique. And a fifty-foot plaster horizont is
something handy to carry in your pocket. But I can act on a
check-room counter, and play my own mouth-organ for incidental
music.'</p>

<p>'You certainly can play your own&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That's not worthy of you! Listen, Beth. I know I'm conceited.
I used to be ashamed of it. But I guess I always will be. Won't
you try and stand it? It's too bad you let me get sidetracked on
to Iris. Because I'll admit, to <i>you,</i> that that young ten-
cent-store siren has got me. Magic, that's what she
had&mdash;black magic. But yours is white. Come on, pet. There's
our bus.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT seemed to Bethel that <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
was not merely a collection of amusing anachronisms, whereby
'modern' very sensibly meant 'commonplace', but also a vehemently
human report of vehement human love. She had heard Andy and
Satori argue as to what 'skains-mates' meant, and whether Quarto
4 with 'swashing' or Quarto 2 with 'washing' was correct, but she
couldn't be much interested. She was too absorbed in seeing
Juliet as a laughing, shattered girl of 1938&mdash;of 2038.</p>

<p>Let's see. She lived in a marble palace, with a prim garden
edged with stone pines, and the murmur of gay, quarrelsome Verona
was filtered through jasmine showering down before her window. Oh
yes. Down the corridor, paved with marble in squares of soft old
red and yellow, was an oriel window and beneath it an oak chest,
carved with passion flowers and crescents interlaced, that her
ancestor, the sailor-doge of Venice, had brought home from raids
of Tartary (where <i>was</i> Tartary?). And here her father,
testy old Lord Capulet, who could be so sweet to his little
daughter when no one was here to watch him, would come with
stories of boar hunting in the Apennines, come down the corridor,
his scarlet-braided robe of silver damask swinging, and his old
rapier hilt, crowned with polished agate&mdash;</p>

<p>Oh no! She was Juliet in modern dress!</p>

<p>No! It was not Verona and marble arches that she lived in,
but&mdash;oh, let's see, let's see&mdash;maybe Hartford,
Connecticut, and an old brick mansion out on Asylum Street. Her
father was old Governor Capulet, rather like that grand old
executive, Governor Wilbur Cross, who had become head of
Connecticut after being dean of the Yale Graduate School. Only
her father was not sweet-tempered like Dr. Cross.</p>

<p>Let's see. Yes, he'd have to be a Catholic&mdash;oh, maybe a
very High Church Episcopalian&mdash;who had sent her to a strict
church school, so that the only handsome young man she had ever
known well was her cousin, Tybalt Capulet&mdash;he'd played polo
in Yale and been chairman of the Prom. Her childhood intimates
(since her mother was a social busybody, much concerned with the
D.A.R. and the lecture committee of the Charter Oak Study Club)
had been a comic small kitten, and her
nurse&mdash;uh&mdash;uh&mdash;Mrs. O'Leary, widow of a bartender,
a woman given to winking and to placid bawdiness, so that Juliet
knew much more about the sound vulgarities than any of the
Sisters in her school. And the Sisters had innocently let the
girls read the Bible&mdash;apple-cheeked maidens beneath the
apple trees, all in gingham aprons and black hair ribbons and
disgusting cotton stockings, softly reading the Song of Solomon
aloud, and giggling.</p>

<p>The best heroine of Juliet-Bethel was Ruth. Yes, she would
gladly follow her lover and live with him amid the alien corn, if
he was true to her and young and strong... and ambitious...
and always true.</p>

<p>The girls in the school were often taken on long walks over
the hills West of Hartford. On the hilltop, under the great sky,
she had sat dreaming of a winged hero who</p>


<p class="verse">

... bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds<br>

And sails upon the bosom of the air.</p>


<p><br> Her little window, high up in the whitewashed wall of
Capulet Dormitory&mdash;her grandfather, the munitions maker,
partner of old Jeremiah Deacon, had given it to the
school&mdash;looked out on stars above and a valley filled with
moving stars below, and once she had thought of an imaginary
lover that, when he should die, the gods would</p>

<br>


<p class="verse">

Take him and cut him out in little stars,<br>

And he would make the face of heaven so fine<br>

That all the world would be in love with night,<br>

And pay no worship to the garish sun.</p>

<br>


<p>And she knew that even on her most finicking, fantastical
days, the young Juliet loved to scrape the crystallized orange
sugar from the inside of a marmalade jar, and lick the spoon.</p>

<p><br>
She was studying the Juliet part all over again, for the
second understudy rehearsal. But she would not let Iris cue her,
nor did Iris ask to be cued.</p>

<p>She went over her part, marking her every error till the typed
pages of the 'sides' looked like bird tracks. How Doc Keezer
knew, she did not learn, but between acts on Friday evening he
snorted, 'Studying Juliet hard? Want to come out and have a
hamburger to-night? And I'll cue you.'</p>

<p>So he did, patiently, demandingly, not letting her off on one
wrong 'a' or 'the'. They sat in a lunchroom, with hash and catsup
and coffee and sides mixed up together on the wide arms of their
chairs. Bethel, stooped and solemn, was staring down at a paper
napkin, while Doc persisted, 'No. You hesitated on that. Do it
again, dear,' and, to the mild horror of a refrigerator salesman
in the row of chairs facing them, Bethel lifted her head, glared
at him, blank-eyed, and yelled, 'Blister'd be thy tongue for such
a wish! He was not born to shame'. The salesman grabbed his neat
grey felt hat, picked up his check, dropped it, picked it up and
fled.</p>

<p>Bethel did not see him. But she did hear, from behind them, in
Iris's light jeering voice, 'Look, Zed. There's the happy young
couple, billing and cuing.'</p>

<p><br>
The ghost walked between the matin&eacute;e and evening, on
Saturday&mdash;Bethel's first ghost. Smiling like her father,
patting her shoulder, Tertius Tully laid on the shelf of her
dressing-table a fat little envelope with the first money she had
ever earned in the theatre.</p>

<p>It was the first money she had ever earned anywhere, except
for the suppositious pay for Saturday afternoons in her father's
store, and a few awe-bringing quarters earned by digging
dandelions for Mrs. Frank Ziffer, two doors down the block. She
slit the envelope with a nail file and reverently took out the
soiled bills and the silver.</p>

<p>It was a quaint sum&mdash;thirty-nine dollars and sixty
cents&mdash;her weekly forty minus one per cent Government social
security. She held it to her bosom. It was not money at all. It
was a new car for her mother and father. It was a journey to
Europe for herself, and the theatre in London and Paris and
Moscow. It was Chekhov and Shaw and Molnar and Somerset Maugham... And it was a dressing-gown like Iris's.</p>

<p><br>
Andy gave them another pep talk, just before that evening
performance; it was a brief pep talk, but&mdash;well, it was a
pep talk, and Tony Murphy snickered.</p>

<p>... The ladies and gentlemen of the company would be glad to
know that they had put it over, this first week in Belluca. The
reviews had been corking, and they had made money! Yes! Not very
much money. Not what they were bound to make on one-night stands.
But they had more than cleared expenses, and next week they would
un-<i>ques</i>-tionably begin to pay back production expenses and
be in the black&mdash;yes<i>sir</i>, in the black&mdash;and
pretty soon he would be able to think about raising everybody's
salary....</p>

<p>Everybody, thereupon, cheered. Including Hoy and Tony Murphy
and Zed Wintergeist.</p>

<p>At two in the morning, after the Saturday night performance,
they took Pullman for their three-night-stand in Treverton,
Illinois (pop. 195,000; brewing and silos). There was no
homeward-looking now, but gaiety and expectation and accustomed
friendliness, as they pattered down the long cement platform, in
the bowels of the Belluca station (celebrated murals of Lewis
&amp; Clark; portrait of James Whitcomb Riley in Italian mosaic)
to their car.</p>

<p>Bethel felt important when the redcap, carrying her bags,
asked, 'Do you belong to the Troupe?' and she came, in the lofty
train shed, in a glare of arclights on steel and cement, to their
own cars, with the sign:</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">Mrs. Lumley Boyle<br>
ROMEO &amp; JULIET IN MODERN DRESS</p>

<p><br>
She was again aware of the importance of Zed's loose camel's-
hair coat, of Doc Keezer's portable radio&mdash;from which he
evoked the far-off incantations of a jazz orchestra in Cincinnati
as soon as he had set it in his berth&mdash;of Mahala's snooty
blue suitcases, and Mrs. Boyle's damned dog.</p>

<p>The family loyalty of Andy's rich cousin was not strong enough
to bring him to the station at two a.m., but the faithful Carl
Frazee saw them off&mdash;and Carl alone. To Bethel and Doc
Keezer he mourned, 'Gee, I'm going to miss you people. The only
fun I get is when a troupe like you come to town and let me tag
along. Don't forget that even if the papers should pan you
sometimes, you are sure-enough missionaries to lonely cranks like
me. I love you both! And you <i>will</i> be married! Don't forget
to send me a bid to your wedding, you two!' And Carl hesitated,
sighed and bolted.</p>

<p><br>
The train was off, to a chorus of 'My Heart Belongs to Daddy'
in young voices, and one of 'Oh, shut up and go to bed' in older
ones, but Bethel, still dressed, sat in her berth, hands clasping
knees, rocking unhappily to the roll of the train. She would miss
Carl Frazee. She would probably forget him, after a dozen other
towns, a dozen other Carls, but she had never had such pure and
kindly affection, nor been so encouraged to believe in her own
career.</p>

<p>Could he be right? Was she anything but another girl to the
busy Andy, to Zed, to the Douglas Fry who had stage diagrams for
veins? She had so often been lonely; she could be lonely again in
this travelling village; only Doc Keezer was always
there&mdash;her Gibraltar.</p>

<p><br>
The singing stopped, and through the train's bumbling she was
conscious of Zed and Iris talking, not very discreetly, sitting
on the edge of Iris's berth just across the aisle.</p>

<p>'You were leering at him.' (That was Zed.)</p>

<p>'I was not leering at him.'</p>

<p>'I didn't mind even that so much, Iris. Lyle Johnson reaches
for a girl the way I do for a Camel. A girl like you, that's
simply all one fever of vanity&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I am not!'</p>

<p>'&mdash;<i>would</i> leer at him. But what I minded was your
fatuousness. So proud that you could win Lyle's
attentions&mdash;which is just about as difficult as winning the
influenza. I don't know's I'm much interested any longer, but I
hate to see even you acting like a comic strip.'</p>

<p>'You can't talk to me like that!'</p>

<p>'I am talking to you like that, ain't I?'</p>

<p>And silence, and Bethel peeped between the weighty green
curtains to see Iris alone, framed by the curtains, slowly
weeping. Bethel loved her then, and was her sister, and hated Zed
for his contempt of foolish, soft girls whom simpering men had
begged, all these years, to be feminine and foolish and soft.</p>

<p>She bounced out from her berth like a small, earnest
schoolma'am going after the local bully, and came on Zed,
standing alone, stoop-shouldered and unhappy, in the vestibule of
the fast train, with the thick canvas of the bellows pulsing, and
the grey steel plates, arching over to make a passageway from car
to car, lifting and dropping and clanking... a place of grime
and steel and snow-streaked glass and ceaseless clamour...
after midnight, pounding through the snow-smeared darkness of the
unknown prairie.</p>

<p>He glared at her and said, 'Women!'</p>

<p>'Yes?'</p>

<p>'I've always thought the most naive thing you could do was to
make generalizations about women, but it's true. Women are all
alike.'</p>

<p>'Zed! I've been listening to you and Iris&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Just couldn't help overhearing it, eh!'</p>

<p>'Certainly I could. I didn't want to. And you were beastly to
that poor, pretentious little guttersnipe.'</p>

<p>'You see? One girl praising another. "Guttersnipe".'</p>

<p>'You listen to me! She's vain, but she's gay and sweet. And
you talked to her like Lyle Johnson. Like a bartender. A cheap,
smirking bartender in a cheap hotel. Beating a butterfly, to show
how strong you are!'</p>

<p>'Oh, pet, I know it! She's a wild rose. I could kick myself. I
got sore at her because she was flirting with Lyle a little. And
here I'd gone and built up a real understanding with her. Poor
kid, she's got a tough nut of a brother that's in trouble, and
she's desperate about raising some money to send him, and here
she'd finally promised to let me lend her some&mdash;'</p>

<p>'How much?'</p>

<p>'Oh, fifty bucks or so.'</p>

<p>'Have you got it&mdash;if you pay any of your debts out of
this week's salary?'</p>

<p>'No, not exactly, but I can prob'ly get it from Andy.'</p>

<p>'And you had to coax her to let you "help" her?'</p>

<p>'How do you mean?'</p>

<p>'So that when she does take it, and plenty more after it, you
won't feel she's under any obligation to you&mdash;it'll be she
who's done the favour? I couldn't've believed it. Honestly, I
couldn't've believed it. You're so intelligent about scripts and
acting, so right, and then about girls, you're just another green
young man. Emotionally, you're aged thirteen.'</p>

<p>'Hey, what the&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Your Iris is a gold digger of the first water. You ought to
know. She trapped you into buying her that mangy new fur.'</p>

<p>'How did you know about&mdash;Look! It wasn't mangy! It was a
very nice fur... It ought to be! How did you know I bought
it?'</p>

<p>'I watched her leading you up to it. You child!'</p>

<p>'Imagine our little Beth trying to be superior!'</p>

<p>'I am. Though I didn't know it till now.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I know all about it. You've been panning me to Iris. You
told her I was crude. You said my acting technique was all ham.
And you even said I didn't make up my nose right!'</p>

<p>'I never said anything of the kind. Don't you know that Iris
is a congenital liar? Don't you? Don't you?'</p>

<p>'And you just defending her!'</p>

<p>'She never even talks honestly to herself. Don't you know
it?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I suppose I do, if I think about her with my brain,
instead of my heart. But why are you so keen about showing her
up, all of a sudden?'</p>

<p>She stumbled in replying; she could not answer his 'Why?'</p>

<p>'I'm not keen about it. I've kept myself from telling you
anything about her for days now, I just hate to see anybody in
this company getting hurt&mdash;oh, by his own generosity,' she
said.</p>

<p>'Well, I'm not going to be. I know Iris is a liar, all
right&mdash;though I'm not such a small boy that I needed to have
<i>you</i> tell me, pet! I'm going to cut her out. I'm going to
cut out all the women in this company. You're all a bunch of
spiritual grafters. You all want admiration. And you're the worst
of the lot.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Zed, please don't.'</p>

<p>'Yes! You wouldn't take presents from me, but you feel you're
the only true devoted actor in the whole bunch! You're the
saviour of the stage! You're the only one that's always on time
at rehearsals! You're the only one that's read clear through Gene
O'Neill! You think you're as devoted as Francine Larrimore. But
you're nothing but Andy Deacon's stooge!'</p>

<p>'I&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You're the Teacher's Pet in this company! The good little
girl that scrubs her face and tattles to teacher!'</p>

<p>At this point she left him, with rapidity.</p>

<p>As she passed the open slanting door of Andy's drawing-room,
he called out to her, 'Beth! Just who I was looking for! C'm in
here!'</p>

<p>He was slouched on the green divan, tucked in among the
impedimenta of the company&mdash;mostly, Mahala's blue bags. He
was wearing a vile tan sweater and discouraged grey trousers and
wrinkled Pullman slippers, like black gloves for his feet.</p>

<p>'What is it?' she worried.</p>

<p>'Here!' He absent-mindedly threw two of Mahala's bags out into
the aisle. 'Sit down. I just want to look at you. I'm all
in.'</p>

<p>'Oh, not after our grand week in Belluca!'</p>

<p>'It was swell, wasn't it! I knew we'd be a success. But
there's been a lot of work&mdash;broadcasting and luncheon
spiels, and you know, I don't act easily. I'm not a natural
actor. I can't relax. I'm always afraid that I'll go up higher
than a kite.'</p>

<p>'Honestly? I never knew that.' He had always seemed
exasperatingly confident on the stage.</p>

<p>'Yep. I'm the eternal amateur, as your friend Zed would
say.'</p>

<p>'Oh&mdash;<i>him!'</i></p>

<p>'So sometimes, to try and relax, I like to just sit down and
look at someone who's cool and sweet and good, like you.'</p>

<p>She hooted. 'And I've just this minute been engaged in pulling
hair.'</p>

<p>'With <i>who?</i> I'll fire her&mdash;or him.'</p>

<p>'Oh no. It's all over. It's just one of those silly self-
deceptions, I guess.'</p>

<p>'Kitten! You look tired, too. Skip to bed, then. Bless
you!'</p>

<p><br>
She was surprised. She had expected Zed to go childishly back
to Iris, but he kept his word, which is a noteworthy phenomenon
among young men who are professionally in love. He did, sharply,
'cut out all the women in this company'. He took dinner with none
of them, nor supper after the show; and on the train he talked to
none except Mrs. Boyle, whom he admired and hated. His chief
childishness was in being noticeably merry with cigar-stand girls
whenever members of the company were in an hotel lobby to watch
him.</p>

<p>He was always seen lunching with Jeff Hoy and Tony Murphy, the
three of them leaning over the table to mutter secretly, looking
about with supercilious brightness, and then stooping over the
table again to mutter humour and conspiracy.</p>

<p>Iris was aflutter at Zed's inattention. The good girl had
accepted his statement that he wasn't much interested in her any
longer in what she supposed to be the spirit in which it was
meant&mdash;that is, as meaning nothing at all. She hovered over
him, bleating, 'Ze-ed, aren't you going to take me out to supper
to-night?' He answered, 'I am not!' so bleakly, so emotionlessly,
that Iris quivered, and Bethel hated the young man for his
cruelty... and was afraid of him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

<p class="first">THREE nights each in Treverton, Paddock, and
Milwaukee; one-night stands in Madison and La Crosse
and&mdash;crossing the Mississippi, to the excitement of
Bethel&mdash;in Dubuque.</p>

<p>Six fluttering arrivals, with reporters on the station
platform and photographers' flashlights blasting the gloom. Six
dashes to get taxis away from her beloved companions in the
company. Six anxious inquiries of marble-fronted-hotel clerks
about rates; and twice when she angrily made it plain that she
couldn't afford it, and quit the caravanserai where Andy and
Mahala and Mrs. Boyle were to loll in kitchenette-bedizened
splendour and hunted up a smaller hotel that looked like a
private house with obesity.</p>

<p>Six broadcasts&mdash;in four of which Bethel had a
part&mdash;and six attempts on the radio to work in, among lively
observations on the art of acting and the joy of being in the
Middle West, the facts that they would be visible at the Blank
Theatre <i>that evening&mdash;</i>hurry, hurry, hurry&mdash;and
that they were a Real Troupe Just From Broadway, Appearing in
Person, and not a movie. Six interviews in which Andy and Mrs.
Boyle and Hugh Challis, with Mahala and Bethel and Iris and
Charlotte sitting in an uncomfortable grinning row on a hotel
settee for extra decoration, caroled that Shakespeare was a very
fine article for the Middle West and the Middle West was fine for
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Six new banging Coffee Shops in hotel basements, with six new
and ever fancier names for beef stew, and six and sixty
overworked waitresses who merely looked cross-eyed and fled, if a
Professional wailed, 'Look, honey, could you hustle my order? I
got to get to the theatre.'</p>

<p>Six new after-theatre restaurants with dancing: The Jeunesse
Dor&eacute;e, with Billy Bagshot's Sunny South Saxophonists; the
Hot Spot, with Tommy Trexler's Cowpuncher Chorus; the Covered
Wagon, with Teddy Taormina's Yankee Yodlers; the Shanghai Divan,
Chinese &amp; American Specialities, with Sven Svenson and His
Demon Accordion; the Petit Prunier, with Abe Garfinkle's Dress
Suit Boys; and Gus's Lunch, with a radio.</p>

<p>And in every one of these Iris went dancing, with Lyle Johnson
or Jeff Hoy or Douglas Fry, while Bethel solemnly sat at a table
way back, with Doc Keezer and Tertius Tully, and ate hash while
they went pretty thoroughly into the topic of comparative box-
office receipts during the past sixteen years.</p>

<p>Six new walks to the theatre, each of them passing a jewellery
shop and a beauty shop, into whose windows Iris looked
passionately, and a brand-new Bank Building, full of
architecture, up at which Douglas looked critically. Six
theatres, ranging from an ancient structure rather like a
Saratoga trunk to the Treverton auditorium.</p>

<p>This was so very new and mammoth and civically conscious an
institution that it could hold six thousand people, and a record
audience of twelve hundred people felt lost and forlorn in its
leatherette wastes. The actors could be heard, like the horns of
elfinland considerably out of tune, only through a Public Address
System, and the more intimate love passages between Romeo and
Juliet were played as from the balcony of the Grand Central
Terminal just after the arrival of the Twentieth Century. On that
vast stage, with an apron thirty feet deep, their sets looked
like toy houses of cardboard.</p>

<p>And six new dressing-rooms in six different towns, and the
speculation as to whether Bethel's next one would be a private
suite, or a stall, without running water or ventilation but with
a richness of steam pipes, which she would share with all the
other women except Mrs. Boyle... Not that she speculated much,
though. She was fairly sure which it would be.</p>

<p>And six first nights of terror in her stomach. But no matter
what changed, and what remained, once she saw the familiar sets,
she was at home&mdash;they were her home.</p>

<p>For a while she could remember the shifting cities by the
dressing-rooms, by the hotel-rooms&mdash;whether they looked out
on an alley or on a Motor Oil Building that was a reproduction of
the Palazzo Vecchio&mdash;by the criticisms, which, in the very
same town, might be either 'diverting, ingenious and brilliantly
acted' or 'this presumptuous but slipshod effort to improve Henry
Irving and E. H. Sothern', and by Andy's assurances that though
maybe to-night's receipts weren't quite all he'd been led to
expect, they would build by the end of the week, and anyway, they
couldn't fail to make a ten-strike in this next town&mdash;'why,
say, <i>Kiss the Boys Goodbye</i> just played it, and took ten
thousand bucks out of town, so if we can't do twelve, I'll shoot
myself'.</p>

<p>But presently she could remember the cities only by the banana
royal that had made her sick, or by being charged twenty cents
for coffee, or by the red rubber overshoes she had bought.</p>

<p>So went the second and third weeks of their gipsying, and
Bethel became a trouper.</p>

<p>And to her the sensation of those weeks was the genteel murder
of Wyndham Nooks.</p>

<p>In Belluca, with some awe of Adrian Satori still hanging
about, Mr. Nooks had merely overplayed&mdash;'hoked' is the
technical word&mdash;the role of the Apothecary, which is a
pretty easy role for anyone to hoke, if he has been born an
earnest, congenital ham.</p>

<p>But in Treverton, the next town, Nooks began to brighten up
the normally disregarded role of First Watchman, in the final
act. When he bounced on stage, in a New York policeman's uniform
not too well fitting at the neck, his speech was, 'Lead boy;
which way?' But for Nooks, Shakespeare unadorned was not enough.
He had to have a lot of Nooks in his Shakespeare. He stopped
after the word 'boy'; he peered about, long pale hand on the
visor of his cap; his knees and elbows quivered; and he yelled
out 'which way?' as one would yell a fire alarm.</p>

<p>As this all happened just before the death of Juliet, Mrs.
Boyle was not pleased.</p>

<p>Andy spoke to Nooks about it every night after the show, in
Treverton. But in the city of Paddock it was the resident manager
of the theatre who spoke about it&mdash;and to Andy.</p>

<p>This manager was named Sam Lee Regis, and he was quite a
pleasant old thug and loafer. The Paddock theatre was, in legal
theory, owned by the estate of a defunct tin-can manufacturer,
whose only chick, a spinster, lived in Vicenza and wasn't very
bright about investments, or anything else except Italian
primitives.</p>

<p>Mr. Regis's salary continued just the same, whether that
handsome old black-walnut-and-crimson-velvet theatre, the Sherman
Square, provided a new play every week or was dark the whole year
through. The local Carl Frazee jabbered to Andy that Mr. Regis
preferred the latter&mdash;it gave him less to do. He
particularly disliked any unusual attraction, like Romeo in grey
bags, that required attentive publicity, but his favourite phrase
about almost every star was, 'He don't mean a dime in the box
office'.</p>

<p>Thus, this season, Sir Cedric Hardwicke in <i>Shadow and
Substance,</i> Cornelia Otis Skinner in <i>Candida,</i> Frank
Craven in <i>Our Town,</i> they none of them to Sam Lee Regis
meant 'a dime in the box office'. That gave the serene old
gentleman&mdash;who had a large moustache, and yet chewed gum
during the moments when he was not slumbering in his old leather
chair in the theatre office&mdash;an excuse for spending almost
nothing on advertising, a topic which Andy was discussing with
him, warmly.</p>

<p>This expense the company and the theatre were supposed to
share equally, but as Mr. Regis looked at it, it wasn't an
expense at all, but just a bad idea.</p>

<p>Mr. Regis droned, 'Boyle don't mean a cent in the box office,
and that old ham you got playing the Watchman and Apothecary,
say, when he wriggled his nose&mdash;it's made of rubber, ain't
it?&mdash;I had the first good laugh I've had since George Cohan
was in town. Now there's a show that <i>is</i>
something&mdash;singin' and dancin'. Why don't you get a show
like that, Mr. Deacon? <i>Shakespeare!'</i></p>

<p>The less Andy thought of Sam Lee Regis, the more he was
irritated that Nooks should give Mr. Regis such an opening. But
nothing happened in Paddock; nothing till Dubuque.</p>

<p>There Bethel was called to Andy's dressing-room before the
evening performance.</p>

<p>Andy looked massive in his loose green silk dressing-gown
(slightly spotty with brown face powder and cold cream), but he
sounded feeble.</p>

<p>'Kitten, I need some advice bad. I've never been so scared.
I've got to fire old Nooks&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, you can't!'</p>

<p>'I'll have to, Beth.'</p>

<p>'But it'll kill him! He's so proud of his technique. He told
me you were thinking of him for Capulet, if Challis ever quit.
And he's showed me twice now the line in the Milwaukee
<i>Sentinel</i> that said he was "a stalwart actor of the old
school". And he's been sending money home&mdash;his wife has been
paying the rent for the first time in a year, he told me, and he
wants to start a rep theatre... and he bought me an ice-cream
soda!'</p>

<p>'Don't I know it, kitten! It's murder. He's probably five
years older than he claims to be. Maybe he'll never get another
job. But if I don't do it, he'll murder the whole company, and
our tour, and throw twenty-eight people out of work. Because he's
getting worse, and he just won't change. But I don't know how to
tell the poor gaffer. I wouldn't mind facing Lyle and Tony, but
this&mdash;Nooks is like an old man crazy in love with a young
girl.'</p>

<p>Then she knew.</p>

<p>Andy was inconceivably hoping that she would do his
slaughtering for him. Between contempt for his weakness and pride
in his sensitiveness and happiness in his turning to her not as
the star to a baby understudy but as one trusty friend to
another, she was dizzy.</p>

<p>She spoke anxiously. 'Can't you pension him off or something?
Maybe money will help to heal the pride.'</p>

<p>'My Beth that's growing up so! You'll be doing Juliet and
Boyle understudying you, before we hit Broadway, but&mdash;No, I
can't even pension Nooks. Sweet, I'm going to tell you something
that nobody knows except Tertius Tully and me. I'm nearly broke.
If our business don't get better, we'll have to close in three-
four more weeks.'</p>

<p>It was like telling a dancing passenger that the ship was
afire and sinking. 'Oh <i>no!'</i> was all she could do.</p>

<p>'Don't tell anybody&mdash;and I mean that. Ever since our
summer in Grampion, I've always sort of felt that you and I were
confidants, even if we have had a whole mess of Mahalas and Zeds
keeping us apart. And now&mdash;it's a comfort to confess to you.
I spent a lot on the sets and costumes in the first place, and
ever since we opened, I've spent more on advertising than usual,
and I'm paying big salaries&mdash;most of the company are getting
more than they ever did in their lives.</p>

<p>'About six thousand a week is the very least we can get along
on, with railroad fares, and trucking the scenery, and what the
union truck drivers and loaders charge us. Well, our first week,
in Belluca, we did make expenses&mdash;with exactly ten cents
over, which I sent to my mother, who's had it mounted in
diamonds. But these last two weeks we've been losing. I thought
that, with the one-night stands, we'd catch up. Everybody told me
that all the farmers for sixty miles around would leap in their
Fords and drive through blizzards to see Romeo Meets Juliet.
Well, either they got sand in their carburettors or they
preferred to stay home and listen to the radio, and maybe they're
right. I can stand it a little while yet, but&mdash;And one thing
you can help me with, darling. If we do pull through, I've got to
have the most unwavering loyalty from every member of the
company. Nobody can let down, on stage or off. I say this to you,
kitten, because I know you're always loyal, and maybe you can
influence the ones that aren't.'</p>

<p>And he looked at her. And she looked at him. And both waited.
And at last she got out, 'Andy, would you like me to fire Nooks
for you?'</p>

<p>'I don't think I could let you do that... I won't pretend
it wouldn't be a big relief. Could you really stand doing it,
chick?'</p>

<p>'Maybe it would be easier for me than for you, Andy. I'm not
so much involved.'</p>

<p>'Maybe it would. I certainly'd appreciate it. Take him out and
buy him a drink, before we go to the train to-night, and spring
it gently&mdash;but I know you would. And tell him that besides
his regular two weeks' notice, I'll give him two weeks' extra
pay. And agree with him that I'm a bum and don't appreciate good
acting when I see it.'</p>

<p><br>
The prologue was rather shaky that night, and the epilogue a
sob. She had invited Nooks out 'for a little supper'; he had
accepted with such grandiloquent gratitude that she felt like a
woman spy tempting a benign admiral.</p>

<p>With a hope that Andy would regard it as business expense and
repay the fabulous cost, she took Mr. Nooks to the Kungsholm
Swedish-American Restaurant, in Dubuque; which has coloured
tablecoths, sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord, and waitresses in that
colourful peasant costume which is apparently the same in Sweden,
Hungary, Albania and Iceland. They had glasses of piercing
aquavit and plates of sausages, and just as Bethel was trying to
bring out the noose tactfully, Wyndham beamed and cried
happily:</p>

<p>'I'm sorry that I've been too busy helping Andy get the
company launched into a sound interpretation of Shakespeare to
see much of you, my dear. I have noticed how pleasant you are to
everybody, even to pompous old hams like Challis and Miss
Staghorn, and I do hope that after this little fling at play-
acting, you'll be able to settle down with a nice husband.</p>

<p>'It's a hard life, the drayma, and now that it's in the hands
of the vicious commercial managers on the one hand, and on the
other, upstarts like the Group Theatre and Cheryl Crawford and
Antoinette Perry and Margaret Webster&mdash;women directing and
managing&mdash;! I've known periods of despondency when I didn't
think I would ever be appreciated again, and in a way I'm very
grateful to our young friend Andy Deacon&mdash;no actor, poor
lad, and a terrible interpreter of the wings of poetry, but he
means so well, and I'm delighted to help him out.</p>

<p>'And I won't pretend to you, with your fresh young face
looking at me, and I can't tell you how touched and gratified I
am to have you blow me to supper this way and to find there are
still a few young people who revere the technic and integrity of
a Professional, and I won't deny that I've been very glad of this
opportunity, however small, though perhaps it would have been
better for the show if they had cast <i>me</i> as Capulet,
instead of that Englishman, Challis, with his old-fashioned
delivery, and so&mdash;</p>

<p>'But what has been especially gratifying&mdash;It doesn't
matter about me. I'm a trouper. I can take it. I can put up with
malodorous bedrooms and chop sooey and the dreadful
embarrassment, to a man of my scholarly rearing, of having to
consort with subway conductors instead of taking taxis. But my
wife, Mrs. Nooks, is a woman of the utmost talent and delicacy.
She's not as young as she was, but that little woman's ambitions
recognize no bounds, as does her affection for my poor self.</p>

<p>'She has for years been longing to study French, but she has
lacked both the means and, when I have been in Gotham, the time,
since her chief preoccupation has been to give me the most
incessant and tender care. But now at last I have been able to
begin sending her enough, not only to begin paying up our debts,
but for her to enter upon the study of the sparkling native
tongue of the witty Gaels, or I suppose you would call them the
Franks.</p>

<p>'She has found the most sympathetic teacher, a French lady,
not so young any longer, but from a very high-placed aristocratic
Parisian family, and Mrs. Nooks has written me, on a postcard
which just arrived this morning, that after only one lesson she
can say, "Send the head-waiter, I wish to order dinner in this
restaurant".</p>

<p>'So I hope that to a dear child like you I shall not seem
ridiculous if I confide to you that a lifelong ambition of Mrs.
Nooks and myself has been to travel abroad and see with our own
eyes the treasures of ancient culture. And now at last we shall
be able to do so.</p>

<p>'Our Romeo tour and Broadway appearance are certain to
continue for two years at a minimum&mdash;I hope so for Andy's
sake as well as mine; he is an amateur at acting, but a very
generous and loyal young friend&mdash;and I am sedulously saving
my not over-excessive salary&mdash;which I trust that Andy will
increase&mdash;and at the end of our run&mdash;think of
it&mdash;our dream for years and years of boarding-houses and
local trains&mdash;our dream that we've talked of till far into
the night&mdash;Mimi and I will go to France!'</p>

<p><br>
She tried.</p>

<p>She hinted that Andy had vulgar conceptions of the classics;
that he was in the clutches of Mahala Vale, who wanted to turn
the play into her private bridge to Hollywood.</p>

<p>Nooks did not hear a word. He was talking about his Conception
of the Role of the Apothecary. There was a light of bliss upon
his tumbling soft white hair, his ever-changing thick red face,
and he felt himself a priest and a servant of mankind.</p>

<p>They were at the point where Nooks was booming, 'I know I'm
too old to tackle Romeo, but I have some ideas that will surprise
you about playing Macbeth', and Bethel was desperately wondering
whether her purse and her sobriety would stand another Swedish
punch, when she saw Andy fling into the restaurant, look about,
look relieved, and shoulder towards them.</p>

<p>His eyes asked what had happened. She shook her head. His lips
formed 'I'll do it', silently, and then aloud, very noisily and
collegiately aloud, Andy greeted them: 'Well, I'll be darned!
What're you two doing here? Buy you a drink? Do you mind if I sit
down with you a minute?'</p>

<p>'My dear boy, it's a pleasure,' said Nooks. 'I think of you
both as my children. I have just been telling little Bethel here
that she mustn't let it worry her if the interpretation of
Shakespeare is beyond her feminine powers. She is all the luckier
to be born to blush unseen as some good man's wife. I was telling
her...'</p>

<p>He did not stop for seven minutes.</p>

<p>Andy was able to convey to Bethel, 'Felt like a dog for asking
you. I'll do it.' But he got no farther than, 'I'm a little
disappointed in the critics' reception, Mr. Nooks. We may have to
make some changes', when Nooks was off on the interesting theory
that all critics are born of an especial brand of acrobats.</p>

<p>Bethel was less sorry now for him than for Andy, with twenty-
eight people's livings to protect&mdash;the forlorn big Andy who
looked beaten. She heard herself piping:</p>

<p>'Mr. Nooks! Please! Please <i>listen</i> a moment!
No&mdash;listen! I think that you ought to know that Andy has
been compelled to plan some changes. He may have to drop either
Iris Pentire or myself&mdash;he hasn't decided which, and I hope
it won't be me, but of course I'll submit without feeling a bit
hurt, if it's necessary for the good of the show&mdash;which is
what we're all after, <i>isn't</i> it?'</p>

<p>She got in a glance at Andy. He was astonished, he was
grateful, he was almost adoring. (Well, he ought to be!)</p>

<p>'And in the same way&mdash;I happen to know that he's not
satisfied with Zed Wintergeist, and may replace him with an actor
who has more suavity.'</p>

<p>At this thundering lie poor Nooks looked delighted.</p>

<p>'And&mdash;you can blame it all on me&mdash;I'm afraid I've
rather encouraged him to feel that just because you <i>do</i> so
wonderfully represent one great classic school of acting, Mr.
Nooks, you scarcely fit in with the crazy experimental way in
which Andy and Satori have done this show, and so&mdash;'</p>

<p>Nooks abruptly turned from her to Andy. His mouth, with its
wide loose pale lips, opened deeply. Bethel expected a roar. But
it was very quietly that he said, 'Andy, do you want to give me
my notice, sir?'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;in a way&mdash;not exactly&mdash;but still&mdash;'
said Andy.</p>

<p>Nooks slowly stood up, his great head back, his eyes closed
for a moment, and his face was the face of a dead man. 'All
right.' His eyes were wet. 'I have been very lonely for my wife,
anyway. She hasn't many friends in New York. She'll be glad of my
return. I'll leave as soon as my successor is ready to take over,
sir. Good night to you both, and the greatest of successes.'</p>

<p>He walked out of the restaurant slowly, his shoulders back and
his head up.</p>

<p>Bethel and Andy sat silently. Silently he pulled out a bank
note and left it on the table for the waiter. Silently he walked
with her to her hotel. Only at the door he said, 'I love you for
what you've done for me. Good night.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

<p class="first">TWO weeks more of one-night stands.</p>

<p>Station platforms and cues and shirred eggs with little farm
sausages and No. 17 purple lining salve and the 7.47 a.m. and the
rumba on a revolving floor under lights changing from green to
fog to crocus and handkerchiefs washed in the bowl and plastered
on the side of a bathtub and looking at the name of the newspaper
to recall in which town you were and the line 'See what a scourge
is laid upon your hate' and a Van Gogh print on a hotel bedroom
wall and brown powder that never quite got out of your ears and
Doc's organ voice as Friar Laurence and chewing gum and the white
mark your hand left on a dusty day-coach seat when you slapped it
and telegraph poles scurrying back and borrowing Kleenex from
Mabel and a world-long rim of pale scarlet along the horizon at
dusk beyond cold December prairies and pots and pots of coffee
and Zed's sad hazel eyes as he brooded over a volume of Rupert
Brooke by a frosted car window and Exit UR and moonlight lamps
staring down pale blue from the borderlights and giggling at a
film along with Vera and Charlotte and street crossings of packed
snow in corduroy rows glistening under the lights between you and
the theatre and here it was almost the half-hour call already and
across the way 'Romeo and Juliet' exciting in electric lights on
the theatre marquee and bath towels long as yourself and acting
beside Zed and small boxes of individual orders of corn flakes
and the cross-word puzzle in the morning paper with which you
tried to keep awake when your eyes looked red and felt red and
your lungs were tickling with train dust and unexpectedly kindly
applause and fried oyster sandwiches and Mrs. Boyle heartbreaking
in 'It was the nightingale and not the lark'.</p>

<p>Down and across the mighty prairies of the Mississippi Valley:
Iowa and South Dakota and Nebraska where, through to-day's
cornfields and cement roads, move the ghosts of Mormon
pioneers.</p>

<p>The fourth and fifth weeks of the tour. Waterloo and Mason
City and Sioux Falls and Sioux City and Des Moines, Cedar Rapids
and Davenport and Burlington and two nights in Omaha, and on New
Year's Eve, St. Joseph, only it's really 'St. Joe', with its
bright hills above the Missouri River that are shrines to Jesse
James, who was the Hitler of his day, with gold watches for his
Vienna and Prague and Warsaw.</p>

<p>When she reached Nebraska, the Bethel who had been coddled in
Connecticut as in cotton batting was certain that she was already
practically in California, and only a step more from Hawaii and
China and Australia&mdash;yes, and perhaps really going
there.</p>

<p>Andy was beginning to hint about their touring Australia. He
whispered to Bethel that she need worry no more about the tour's
closing; yes, he was still losing money, but not so much, and in
the metropolises of Kansas City and St. Louis, so justly proud of
their auditoriums, their Little Theatres, their symphony
orchestras, he would 'make a pile&mdash;enough to carry them till
the luck changed and they began to coin money'.</p>

<p>So they went on, descendants of the Covered Wagon, with
portable radios instead of the slim columns of signal smoke seen
across the sun-drowsing plains. And so she discovered
America.</p>

<p><br>
The stretch of plains was so unpunctuated. All morning long,
from the train window, the snow and sky had been confused in one
slope of empty grey, and Bethel was weighed down by the sky's
heaviness. She was homesick for the New England stone walls,
lively with squirrels and thrushes that had invited her girlhood
outings. But here the farmhouses, cruelly far from one another,
crouched with their barns and grim cement silos in little nests
of cottonwood trees; as alone and individual and strange as a
shepherd's cot in the Highlands.</p>

<p>An hour before they came to their next stand, the sun was
through, and the morning of creation was miraculously renewed.
Suddenly the sky was tremendous, glorious with unsoiled blue; the
snow was a silver mantle; and she saw how many of the houses,
along with lean and grey-streaked prairie poverty, were new-
painted bungalows, with solid, hip-roofed barns, jauntily bearing
bright galvanized-iron ventilating cowls. The silos were towers,
now, brave as the old, sea-facing watchtowers she had seen in
pictures of southern France.</p>

<p>Their city, when they came to it, was gay with sun, young and
eager. The station had miles of leather-and-chromium chairs in
the waiting-room, and the attendants were like collegians, very
friendly with young actresses. The hotel was new, and her room,
all in maple, with a Navajo bedspread, was on the thirtieth
floor. She looked out on the medley of Old West and New Pan-
America that is characteristic of all that land: skyscrapers and
a marble Art Institute and a luxurious-looking Georgian brick
Town Hall Club among a Shanghai sprawling of tin-roofed one-story
shacks plastered with signs advertising beer and candy bars.</p>

<p>Then her nap, curled snugly on that heavenly bed. (The
mattress was astonishingly named the Slumber Coaxie, and had, it
seems, been Scientifically Constructed in accordance with the
findings of a Conference of Forty Professors, Housewives and
Social Leaders. But it really was a good mattress, once you got
to sleep and forgot the lush poetry.)</p>

<p>She awoke to sunset.</p>

<p>She had not known such extravagant sunsets as these of the
plains. In Connecticut sunsets were usually frail, tranquil,
pretty affairs, that economically afforded you a couple of strips
of pale crimson, and one of old gold, with a good effort in the
way of an apple-green sky beneath. They were the crisp bacons of
sunsets. But these displays in Iowa and Nebraska were Ninth
Symphonies, battle pieces, insanities of flame and gold.</p>

<p>She discovered a curious rule: A truly great sunset will
always be in this form: it portrays a seabound land of burning
lava, through which winds a golden river to the bright bays and
inlets of a glowing sea.</p>

<p><br>
When they had crossed the Missouri River, she decided that she
was no longer in the prosperous Middle West but in the real West
that, with its myths and true memories of cow-punchers and John
Brown and the Santa Fe Trail and the Gold Rush and Indian braves,
of frontier saloons and railroad builders and two-gun sheriffs,
of mountains and ranches and deserts, is one of the five or six
romantic districts of the whole world.</p>

<p>She loved her tight New England as much as ever; she was not
parrot enough to echo, 'New York isn't America'. But she had had
a bath of greatness, and she came out of all this not a Yankee
but an American.</p>

<p>And an American who, born in 1916, might live to see the
fabulous Great Land of the year 2000.</p>

<p><br>
All the time that she was thus tasting greatness, she was
entirely surrounded by love, and none of it was hers, and she
didn't like the idea at all.</p>

<p>The corporation of Mahala and Andy Deacon, an institution
engaged in dancing together, expensively dining together, and
squabbling together, went on like tired matrimony, with none of
the advantages. Bethel suspected that Mahala would never give up
Andy so long as she rather thought he was a good actor and
decisively thought that he was a good athlete and very rich; and
that Andy stuck only because he was expected to. Bethel was
irritated by Andy's unimaginative humbleness. His good-night
kisses of Mahala in hotel lobbies were like porridge without
cream. And in the fifth week Mahala began writing many letters;
began receiving, from New York, many letters, air-mailed, all in
the same masculine script.</p>

<p>Bethel could tell exactly the day on which Mahala must have
learned that Andy was (if possibly still quite as athletic) not
so rich as he had been. It was on December 23rd, in Des Moines.
That evening she came gushing into Bethel's dressing-room, which
normally Mahala would as soon have thought of entering as she
would a lecture-room on foreign affairs. She was an angel in a
voluminous white linen dressing-gown with blue ribbons. She
gurgled, 'My, you've got such a sweet dressing-room! An arm-
chair! Well, you deserve it, Beth. I was just saying to Hugh
Challis last night that you have the real, sure-enough Old Vic
touch in your&mdash;what d'you call it?&mdash;prologue.'</p>

<p>'Did you?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes! And he agreed with me. Uh&mdash;Beth! Have you heard
rumours about Andy not being able to get any more backing, and
being busted? I know we're not making any money but&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I don't know a thing about it,' lied Bethel.</p>

<p>Afterward she wondered why, since she was going to lie anyway,
she hadn't done a really good, crooked, malicious lie and told
Mahala that Andy was sneaking off early mornings and pawning his
silver-backed brushes and his silver brandy flask and his
sapphire-studded (and rather pretentious) cigarette lighter. Then
Mahala might have chucked him; then Andy might have stooped
fondly down to her, the adoring peasant girl.</p>

<p>But would she have cared now?</p>

<p>Oh yes! Andy was so much kindlier than Zed, so much younger
than Doc Keezer, so much wilder and warmer than Doug Fry, so much
more desirous of a shining future than Fletcher Hewitt and so
much her own good tutelary god.</p>

<p>She saw Andy, now, taking Mahala to cheaper restaurants and
buying sherry instead of champagne cocktails; she saw that Mahala
was complaining; but seemingly it did not occur to Andy to
complain of her complaining.</p>

<p><br>
With all the fury that he gave to rehearsals, to learning a
part, or to being rude to people he considered bogus, Zed had
dived into books. He was as out of the arena of love as Bethel
herself. He was reading&mdash;really reading, and not talking
about it, like Challis or Mahala or Charlotte: marching through
the novels of Hemingway, Dos Passos, Steinbeck, James
Farrell.</p>

<p>And Iris had become intellectual&mdash;that is, for Iris. As
there seemed to be no one more lucrative available, she had
cleaved to Douglas Fry, and she listened to his talk about
cycloramas and gelatins with a sweet, sedate vacuousness...
and out of it she did at least have, as a pledge of Douglas's
low-pressure ardour, a new trinket bracelet, on which she hung
miniature elephants, locomotives, giant pandas, Charlie McCarthy
and orchids.</p>

<p>But the torch of the caravan was the somewhat argumentative
passion of Henry W. L. Purvis, Ph.D., and Charlotte Levison.</p>

<p>Harry Purvis could make dirty puns in Greek, Italian and
Chaucerian English. Even when they were in Greek, which naturally
you did not understand as well as you did Chaucer, you knew they
sounded dirty.</p>

<p>Harry was born in Gooversville, Georgia. Eight years ago he
had graduated from William and Mary College, where he had majored
in tennis and drinking and been the life of a small, rebellious
dramatic society that put on plays ridiculing the Old South. He
had taken his doctorate in English and Philosophy at Chicago,
just barely <i>cum laude;</i> had gone to teaching in Hotchkiss
School, and after six months of it, been enthusiastically
fired.</p>

<p>Various reasons have been alleged: that he had been too
obliging about lending Rabelais to students; that he had got
drunk at Torrington with three students and, on the way home, not
liking the diction of one of them, a young gentleman from
Brooklyn, had chased him out of the car, removed his trousers,
and left him beside the road; and that he knew more than all the
rest of the faculty put together and mocked their learning. Being
cheerful and handsome and completely penniless, he had been
accepted by the Federal Theatre, and had played a Rich Young Man
so pleasantly that the audiences cheered every night when he was
killed off by a sturdy striker.</p>

<p>He had been in the theatre for four years now, and he was the
most devoted trouper in the whole Romeo company. He even liked
one-night stands, except that fourteen hours seemed to him too
long to stay in any town that served highballs with the whisky in
one glass and soda in another. He was never drunk before eleven-
thirty p.m., and never sober between that hour and three a.m.,
and in all states of inebriety he quoted Ernest Dowson, Artemus
Ward and Albert Jay Nock.</p>

<p>He looked like a young Velasquez cavalier.</p>

<p>At just what crisis he had been married, no one was certain,
but his wife was tucked away on Morningside Heights. He did not
speak of her often, but apparently she had been the youthful
error of a lonely young man in a Chicago boarding-house, and
apparently she was named Amarette (with an <i>a</i>).</p>

<p>Rehearsals had not gone on four days, back in New York, before
the Don from Gooversville and the Gainsborough Duchess from Grand
Street, Charlotte Levison, had begun dining together, and before
the company left Belluca, the relationship seemed almost legal.
Purvis and Charlotte sat up till three a.m., drinking and talking
about stopping drinking, and arguing about the folly of arguing
about Communism.</p>

<p>No Bible-kiver-to-kiver Southern Fundamentalist Baptist could
have taken her Gospel, her Party Line, more seriously and more
credulously than Charlotte. Whenever the Moscow government was
shocked to discover that the highly placed and trusted Admiral
Asky group were traitors and saboteurs, and re-educated them with
pistols in the backs of their necks, and replaced them with the
long known and loyal set of General Bsky, and then, with naive
yelps, found that the Bsky scoundrels were even worse and had,
without Stalin's noticing it, been sending notes to the English
from his own back office when all the while he had thought they
were sitting there playing solitaire, and he defended the rights
of humanity by slaughtering them, too, and put in the
incorruptible cohorts of Commissar Csky&mdash;who turned pale and
hastily made their wills&mdash;then the kind Charlotte, who
secretly loved <i>Peter Pan</i> better than she did Gorky and who
wouldn't step on a backstage cockroach, not even a Trotskyist
cockroach, just smiled and carelessly explained to Purvis that it
was all for purity.</p>

<p>Sitting in a grill with Purvis, she liked to tell of her
father's escape from a burning Jewish village in Russia, after
seeing his father disembowelled before him, and then add brightly
that no immigrant to America and particularly no Jew has a chance
in this wickedest of all capitalisms, and that 78 per cent of
these immigrants are lying out under the Brooklyn Bridge and
rapidly starving to death&mdash;and have been for years.</p>

<p>Purvis, equally loving her and exasperated by her bland
dogmatism, always snarled back that if he were a Communist, he
would be out of this in five minutes and go live in a factory
tenement; certainly not use an airy Communism as a means of being
fashionable, and sit beside a tiled swimming pool, like the
famous and fashionable Hollywood fellow-travellers, and condone
slaughter over a mint julep. But it was the fate of this Tybalt
to play whirligig through all his romance.</p>

<p>The moment he had done a passionate job of denouncing
Charlotte, they would be joined by such reactionaries as Hugh
Challis or Tertius Tully, and instantly, ranging up beside
Charlotte, Purvis would be heard announcing that in Russia all
actors are cared for by the government like pet rabbits and that
any peasant just off the seat of a tractor can act with more
disciplined technique than Noel Coward and design scenery more
artfully than Oenslager or Bel Geddes.</p>

<p>Then, in Mason City, at a party given to the company by the
citizens, Harry Purvis announced that Charlotte and he were going
to be married.</p>

<p>The members of the company sat with dumb mouths. Purvis was
already married! What about poor Amarette (with an <i>a</i>)? Had
she gone to Reno?</p>

<p>In a pleased way he explained that there wasn't any Amarette.
Ever a cautious drunk, Harry had invented her because otherwise
he might never have known to whom he would find himself married
some morning.</p>

<p>Charlotte was one of the people who were surprised and
somewhat gratified by the announcements that Harry was unwed and
that she was going to marry him. Oh well, said her ducal and
matronly smile, you just never could tell what her bad boy would
be up to next.</p>

<p>They were married after the show, in Sioux Falls, South
Dakota, and the wedding party was held on the train. Andy had
provided champagne and canned alligator pears. But a few of the
merry rout drank nothing at all&mdash;Bethel, Vera Cross, Mabel
Staghorn, Douglas Fry and Dr. Henry W. L. Purvis.</p>

<p>In a long speech with footnotes Harry explained that he was
now a teetotaller and a working Communist, and that as soon as
the tour was ended, he was going to do something (vague but
powerful) for the Cause.</p>

<p>His wife smiled on him sleepily and murmured, 'That's swell.
But let's see if we can't save up for a month in Bermuda first,
Harry, and rent a cottage. I've always longed so for a house of
my own, where you can go up and downstairs.'</p>

<p>'Well, okay, then, dearie,' said that scholarly, that fierily
crusading, that passionately romantic Tybalt, Comrade Purvis.</p>

<p><br>
But the catastrophe to Bethel was the desertion of her heart's
guardian, Doc Keezer. And it was actually to Mabel Staghorn that
she lost him, and all along of Miss Staghorn's new kitten, a soft
but in no way remarkable kitten, vilely named Pippy.</p>

<p>Miss Staghorn, who off-stage was Mrs. Wallace Tibby, wife of
the esteemed taxidermist, was the kindliest and the friendliest
person in the company, and much the worst nuisance. Anyone who
did not dodge quickly, she would assault with loving greetings
just at the edgy moment before he made an entrance on stage. Not
for her the quick pat on the back and the cheery 'Good luck!' of
the ordinary trouper. Just when Doc Keezer was trying to remember
whether his entrance line, as Friar Laurence, was 'Romeo, come
forth; come forth, thou fearful man', or 'Come forth, thou
fearful man, come, Romeo', or 'Romeo, thou fearful man, come
forth, come forth', or what the devil it was that came forth,
Mabel Staghorn would maternally pat him, and gurgle, 'Now I just
know you're not going to slip again on that line'. And so he
would enter and slip.</p>

<p>On trains and at restaurants, Mabel took the trouble to go
from seat toseat, conveying what she frequently called 'little
bluebird greetings to keep everybody happy'. She always, on such
occasions, cried cheerily to the men, 'Now don't stand up', and,
if they didn't stand up, looked pained.</p>

<p>If the theories of scrambled time are correct, to this moment
there stand all over the Middle West annoyed groups of male
actors, holding their napkins and watching their minute steaks
grow cold, while Miss Staghorn vocally caresses them in liquids
like a brook at eventide:</p>

<p>'Now don't let me disturb you&mdash;I just wanted to see if
you were all comfortable&mdash;is there anything I can do for
anybody?&mdash;oh, did you <i>notice</i> how slow Andy was on his
cues to-night?&mdash;I'm sure he's worried&mdash;my, I do hope
we're making money this week....'</p>

<p>Mabel believed in all the stage superstitions. Stronger even
than her faith in a rabbit's foot for powder brush was her
certainty that you mustn't whistle in the dressing-
room&mdash;perhaps she wouldn't have asserted that the San
Francisco earthquake was due to some noodle's whistling in his
dressing-room, but she would have looked into it.</p>

<p>At a rehearsal you should never give the tag line&mdash;that
finished off the show, didn't it? You mustn't open an umbrella on
the stage (and this even after the cast had opened umbrellas all
over the stage in <i>Our Town),</i> or put shoes on your
dressing-table or pass anyone on the stairs on the way to your
dressing-room, or have yellow in the room, or sing 'Home, Sweet
Home' on the stage; and in your hotel room, to lay a hat on the
bed was to affront God himself.</p>

<p>Doc Keezer didn't exactly believe in any of these voodoos. He
just didn't take a chance on them. He grunted, 'Why the devil
does Zed <i>have</i> to whistle in his dressing-room? I'm not
superstitious about it. But it makes a such row. Why can't he
just sing?'</p>

<p>Mabel Staghorn had an infallible taste for banalities. Having
been on the stage since she was eleven, and reared on
Shakespeare, Moli&egrave;re, Sheridan and
<i>Variety&mdash;</i>whose renowned headline, 'Stix Nix Hix Pix',
is but an example of its contribution to a living American
Language&mdash;Mabel never said anything whatever that would have
been unexpected in Mrs. George F. Babbitt. When Jeff Hoy observed
that Mabel turned Shakespeare's Nurse into a Red Cross nurse,
Mabel sighed, 'I never pay any attention to him; I just consider
the source'.</p>

<p>She thought it all over and said profoundly to Zed, 'I do
think people ought to make some little effort and try and be on
time for rehearsals, don't you?' When he blandly answered, 'But
don't you think that might cramp their individualities?' she
fretted, 'Now I'm sure you don't mean that&mdash;a real, earnest
young man like you&mdash;my gracious, I thought <i>you</i> were
one of the young actors who realized that an actor's career is
just one long devotion to duty'.</p>

<p>Mabel's dressing-table, in the theatre, was as domestic as
Grover's Corners. She did not carry a steel make-up box, but a
litter of salves and pencils and powders and brushes in a pansy-
embroidered linen bag&mdash;once white, now stained with every
shade of faded carmine&mdash;which she spread out on the shelf,
with a little ivory Egyptian cat-god, her mascot, and a
photograph of her nephew, who was 'doing very well' as accountant
in the South Tallahassee Power and Lighting Corporation.</p>

<p>She had, to some degree, a husband, but she had no children.
She spoke well and often of children, to whom she invariably
referred as the 'dear little ones' or as the 'chickabiddies'. But
personally she had no children. She had cats.</p>

<p>She had, she explained to everyone, seven cats, reluctantly
left to the unfeeling care of her husband in the flat in New
York. The husband meant well but, it seems, he never could
remember that Frou-Frou had to have liver ground, not mashed, and
Kittenkatz (aged nine) required three drops of cod-liver oil in
her liquor, which had to be two-thirds milk and one-third
cream.</p>

<p>'That woman's got cat blood,' said Zed, as he heard Mabel
explain to Charlotte that 'kittens are just as knowing as
children&mdash;the way they look up at you with their sweet
little eyes&mdash;like forget-me-nots&mdash;and they're so much
more sympathetic. You can get just as fond of them as of
children.'</p>

<p>Said Zed, 'Yeah, but there's not much fun planning future
careers for cats, Mabel.'</p>

<p>Doc Keezer, tolerant as sunshine, had always been amused by
Mabel where the others were itched. And not even in Tertius Tully
did Doc find so much of the ardent recollection of unimportant
gossip that keeps the true trouper happy.</p>

<p>When he yawned at Mabel, 'Say, which of the Trout sisters was
it that played Agnes on tour with Ambrose Gillyflower in <i>The
Brave Die but Once,</i> in 1906?' she did not flee. She rubbed
her nose, and looked eager, and sighed, 'Now, isn't that
funny?&mdash;I guess I'm losing my memory&mdash;oh well, we all
grow old&mdash;I often say, "It don't matter what you forget if
you can still learn your parts"&mdash;but isn't it
funny?&mdash;oh yes&mdash;now I remember&mdash;it was Tacoma
Trout&mdash;Cheyenne Trout was in burlyque that season and Albany
Trout was singing the Duchess of Dantzig.'</p>

<p>In a caf&eacute;, between midnight and train time, Doc Keezer
noticed a kitten, a small highwayman kitten, white with a black
mask over one eye, sitting on the bar among the port and sherry
bottles, washing its nose. Having had three quick gin-and-
vermouths, Doc was certain that it winked at him with its masked
eye. He thought sentimentally of Mabel's loneliness, bought the
kitten for fifty cents, went, with the highly encouraging Tony
Murphy, to awaken an infuriated veterinary surgeon, bought a cat
basket, and on the train presented the treasure to Mabel
Staghorn.</p>

<p>He had been slightly mocking, but Doc was touched when Mabel
lifted the kitten out of the basket, curled it on her bosom,
looked up at him (she seemed so old and tired, in a cotton
nightgown, with gum of make-up still crusted on her weary
eyelids) and began to cry.</p>

<p>'No one's ever been so sweet to me, Doc,' she wept. 'I didn't
know I had any real, warm friends in this company. Now I know.
And that makes me even happier than this dear kitty... We'll
call it Pippy.' Very cheerfully: 'It'll make Mrs. Boyle and her
Pekinese sore as crabs. Oh, I could just kiss you for this,
Doc!'</p>

<p><br>
Mrs. Aurelia Boyle, the permanent Juliet of the Anglo-
American-Australian-South African stage, was reserved and County
English; she was well bred and bad-tempered; she often informed
Andy&mdash;one of the few people to whom she ever spoke, off-
stage&mdash;that she demanded nothing of life, and indeed she did
demand nothing much beyond top billing, a salary equal to half
that of all the other nineteen actors put together, the box-
office statement for every performance, delivered&mdash;without
fail&mdash;in her dressing-room before the third act, the bridal
suite in hotels (at half rates), a drawing-room on trains, a
combination of never being bothered by reporters or photographers
and of daily seeing extensive and reverent biographies of herself
in the press, a daily supply of whisky, and vice-regal precedence
for her snarly-faced Pekinese, Pluto.</p>

<p>Andy walked it, Hugh Challis fed it lamb chops, Charlotte,
slightly shuddering, petted it, and (though she declined) Bethel
was once invited to shelter it for the night in her upper berth,
when poor Aurelia could obtain nothing but a compartment. Aloof
though Mrs. Boyle might be, her mutt was full of a sinister
friendliness. Happy bridge players of the company, planning to
overbid in hearts, would feel a queer, ghostly presence about
their lower legs and look down to see Pluto grinning at them and
thinking about nipping their calves. Sleepers on daytime jumps
would dream of seven-headed serpents and start awake to find
Pluto dribbling on their bosoms.</p>

<p>Not a popular dog.</p>

<p>But to Mrs. Boyle, who often bemoaned her childlessness, in
some forgetfulness of a son by her first marriage, a son who now
lived in Maidstone Hill and had two children and played
badminton, the hound Pluto was her child and her soul.</p>

<p>When she saw the cat Pippy, in her miserable basket, being
carried on the train by Mabel Staghorn, she screamed. She really
screamed. She wailed at Andy, 'As if I hadn't suffered enough
having that Staghorn woman for Nurse! And now she has that mangy
animal. I won't endure it! You may laugh, my good man, but I tell
you Pluto is sensitive as Shelley. He'll be terrified by that
alley tiger.'</p>

<p>For once Andy stood up to the prima donna and said, soundly,
'Oh, don't be silly'. But it was worse than Aurelia had
expected.</p>

<p>Pluto was fascinated by Pippy at once, and then enamoured of
her. He showed all the antics of a small boy in love. He stalked
round and round the bored Pippy, while the company embarrassed
him by giggling. He feebly smiled at her and invitingly paddled
with his paws. He escaped from Mrs. Boyle's drawing-room on
trains at night and sat lovingly before the berth in which
reclined Miss Staghorn and Pippy, and from time to time he
awakened everybody with a thin celestial howl, and when they
popped out of berths and cursed him, he looked at them with an
evil, aged, oriental guile and howled again.</p>

<p>And he almost broke the granite heart of Mrs. Boyle by
desertion.</p>

<p>Meantime, Pippy brought those ageing innocents, Mabel Staghorn
and Doc Keezer, together.</p>

<p>Being responsible for the cat, Doc went on, in duty to it,
buying liver and catnip and cleaning its basket. He found
something homelike in caring for a rather helpless woman and her
feline child. Hour on hour the three of them, Doc, Mabel and
Pippy, sat together in the plush seat of a day coach, relaxed in
such warm and velvety communion as 'Well, I can remember when
Walter Huston first decided to play in <i>Desire Under the
Elms.</i> He says to me, "Doc," he says&mdash;of course him and
me were old friends...'</p>

<p>It occurred to Bethel, a little wretched that she had never
seen it, that Doc had overwhelmingly wanted someone who wanted
him. He was exhilarated by having a friend who depended on him
for small cold walks in unknown streets between matin&eacute;e
and evening, for getting a taxi, for finding the drugstore with
the best ten-cent coffee.</p>

<p>His fondness for Bethel had cooled into an amiable 'How's
tricks, child?'</p>

<p>Doc Keezer had come home, and she was the more homeless in it.
A little frightened, she reached tentative hands out to Zed and
Andy.</p>

<p>Zed invited her to attend the <i>Pygmalion</i> movie, and then
forgot the engagement.</p>

<p>Andy was too busy quarrelling with Mahala to notice anybody
else.</p>

<p>She was truly alone.</p>

<p><br>
She had never in any moment loved Doc or Fletcher Hewitt. But
had she ever loved Andy? Or had it been just gratitude and
dazzle? Had she ever been on the verge of falling in love with
Zed? Or had it just been stimulus and curiosity and the
compliment he paid in bullying her?</p>

<p>She had supposed that, whatever complications and dizziness
there might be once you were plunged into love, there was first a
divine certainty about knowing that you were in love. She felt
lost now, and insignificant. She felt like an understudy.</p>

<p>And understudies suffer not so much from cruelty as from
invisibility.</p>

<p>It has been recorded that Bethel was naturally of the lonely
type&mdash;of the loneliness that is the pain and penalty of
being individualistic. In the gregariousness of rehearsals and
the first credulity of the tour, she had seemed cured. But now
she settled down, apparently for the rest of her life, to Steak
Medium Rare with Tertius Tully, Hugh Challis, Jones Awkwright
(Wyndham Nooks's successor, a pool-playing man) and occasionally
Doc Keezer.</p>

<p>They never talked of anything but the stage.</p>

<p>Challis referred to 'the drama'. Doc Keezer said 'the
theatre'. To Tertius Tully, it was always 'show business'. To all
of them, it was all that was important and pleasant in life.</p>

<p>And so it was with Bethel Merriday as, lonely or no, she
became a trouper.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE telephone jeering beside her bed. Her whole
body trying to shut it out. Sliding instantly, when the bell
ceased, into a gulf of sleep. The bell again, ringing for hours
and hours, while for hours and hours she tried not to hear it.
The sick weakness with which she fumbled for the telephone
instrument. The voice, cool, wakeful, in the little black-rubber
magic cylinder, 'Six-thirty'. Her body collapsing again into
sleep, but her mind making her swing her legs over the edge of
the bed, so that she could not yield... To miss the train, the
performance? Horror!</p>

<p>She had got to bed at twelve-thirty; she had had six hours'
sleep; her body was wailing for eight hours&mdash;ten&mdash;the
clock round.</p>

<p>Feebly she picked up the telephone again. Room service. 'This
is 1679. I want a pot of coffee and some buttered toast, right
away. I've got to catch a train.' 'Yah, right away,' said the
Mid-European who, in all mannerly hotels, mis-answers the room-
service telephone.</p>

<p>Through a fog she tottered into the bathroom, still wobbly at
the stomach, and slapped her cheeks, her eyes, the back of her
neck, with cold water. No time for a cold bath&mdash;and no
energy, either, nor any warmth to spare, this December
morning.</p>

<p>She meditatively scratched her knees, and looked down at her
toes, reflected that Iris tinted her toenails, thought it would
be rather fun to do the same, also thought that it would be
intensely wicked, wriggled her toes&mdash;then yelled, 'Wake up,
<i>you!'</i></p>

<p>She stalked back to the telephone.</p>

<p>Now six months ago Bethel would have felt herself a fiend to
talk loudly to shut-ins down in the service department, and an
ingrate and a heathen to have doubted their zealous desire to
serve, but she was 'not going to have any more of this business
of having to catch a train with the room waiter coming in just as
she had to run for the elevator'. She yelled, 'This is 1679.
Where's that order of coffee and toast? I've been waiting half an
hour.'</p>

<p>''S on the way up,' said Room Service, as mendacious as
herself.</p>

<p>Dressed, she tried to stuff the mixture of stockings,
handkerchiefs, clippings of reviews, hairbrush, into a suitcase.
They were all growing in bulk, or else her bags were shrinking in
the winter cold.</p>

<p>The coffee had come. She tipped the waiter&mdash;resenting the
tip&mdash;and drank the coffee&mdash;resenting God. She called a
bellboy, thought that he looked at her admiringly, foggily forgot
it, and staggered after him to the desk, downstairs. The old, old
business of the girl cashier's mechanical, dehumanizing, slot-
machine demand 'Whacha room number?' of waiting for her bill,
looking it over (just to seem wise, not because she could ever
add it), making sure that she had left her room key, wavering
through the pillared lobby and down crimson-carpeted steps to the
sidewalk, to a taxi, counting her bags to make sure she had them
all... She would probably, in her continued state of
drowsiness, have counted two or even one as three, and been
wearily content.</p>

<p>Driving through the city in a dream. Half conscious that about
her were new buildings, new people. Take that cheery policeman
talking to the man opening up a cigar store, both of them
laughing, their words coming out in white steam; he was probably
important to himself, and worth knowing, but she must forget him
and keep going.</p>

<p>One-night stands!</p>

<p>Stiffly climbing out of the taxi at the huge wide sidewalk in
front of the railroad station's Corinthian pillars. The rest of
the company coming up in taxis behind her, but the loving
greetings pretty shy now and doubtful and hungry-sounding, even
Andy's affectionate 'Hello, kitten; still alive?'</p>

<p>A safari of silent actors following silent redcaps, luggage-
laden, through the vast sonority of the waiting-room, down a
gold-and-marble corridor, down stairs to a mysterious dark
underpass, like a corridor from the Bastille, with arches along
it labelled Track One, Track Two, Track Three, which gave on
cinder-smeared stairways. Then up again and into the open air, on
a long cement runway between sunken tracks, and, despite a
determination never to feel human again, fresher and gayer and
full of hope... hope of glory and more coffee. And the train
pushing in, with white smoke against a flashing winter morning
sky.</p>

<p>One-night stands!</p>

<p>At five in the afternoon, after her nap on a strange bed in a
strange room in a strange city, she awoke when the telephone
again called her. She stretched happily. She yawned with
unrefined noisiness. In her neglig&eacute;e she moved across the
dark room and raised the blind. Down there was an unknown main
street, the shuttle of an unknown corner, and head-lights and
tail-lights and neon signs dancing a dance of flame through
falling snow. She half remembered thus looking at a city inferno
in New York, when she had been hungry and depressed. Now it was
all hope and waiting eagerness, for in three hours she would be
made up and before an audience. She lifted the window; the wet
air was exciting.</p>

<p>A new city, and to-morrow another new city&mdash;on for ever
through the mighty land.</p>

<p>One-night stands! To Jeff Hoy and Mabel Staghorn, purgatory.
One-night stands! To Bethel, 'the very name was like a
bell&mdash;'</p>

<p>Even if at six-thirty a.m. it was like a telephone bell!</p>

<p><br>
Since it was the only permanent furniture in her wandering
home, Bethel became absurdly familiar with her own baggage and
every most trivial detail of her small possessions. The theatre
trunk, with her costumes, and the other suit, to which she
changed for the street at every other town. And maybe that wasn't
a proud thing to see: a trunk with her initials and the licensed
word 'THEATRE' painted on it. Her make-up box, severe and
professional, of olive-green light steel. Her dressing-room
slippers, mules of blue wool, and her dressing-gown for making
up, near-silk, its pattern of mignonette soon indecipherable
among red stains of powder.</p>

<p>In this neglig&eacute;e she was accustomed to run up and down
dressing-room corridors. All of them were used to popping into
one another's rooms half dressed, and they had all the innocence
of children. All the Mrs. Worthingtons who want to put their
daughters on the stage are advised that nowhere is the virtue of
maidenhood less likely to be assaulted than in the theatre. The
Zeds, themselves no celibates, are curiously fastidious, and the
Lyle Johnsons&mdash;who in the classic shades of country clubs
and campuses are such successes&mdash;become mere bores to wise
and travelled young ladies.</p>

<p>This trunk, with these working clothes, met her daily,
deposited in her dressing-room. She herself took care of her
three pieces of hotel baggage.</p>

<p>The Big Suitcase, canvas-covered, rickety from much closing by
standing on it: an inheritance from Sladesbury; ugly enough but,
once opened, a delight to Bethel with its fresh blouses and slips
and her two proud afternoon frocks.</p>

<p>The Middle-sized Bag, with stockings, handkerchiefs and doggy
copies of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>And the new, quite expensive Overnight Bag, with pyjamas,
dressing-gown, slippers, toilet things.</p>

<p>Night after night, on one-night jumps, this last was about the
only piece that ever got opened. To the trouper, packing and
unpacking are luxuries, like golf or families.</p>

<p>Each tiniest possession became familiar and important against
the changing backgrounds. When her canary-yellow-handled tooth-
brush, whose colour cheered her when she wearily brushed her
teeth, wore out, she felt as lost and guilty at throwing it away
as though it were an old companion.</p>

<p><br>
But nothing of her own could be more familiar than the sets of
the play, to whose comfortable greeting she kept returning in the
strangest places&mdash;once in a hall that was practically part
of a stockyard, chummily near the pigpens.</p>

<p>Watching Gene Doric, the master carpenter, mount and shift
these seats, watching him curse and pray over the resident stage
crews whom the local manager dug out of the Civil War Home,
Bethel loved Gene and admired his endurance (supported entirely
on coffee and chewing gum). He called her Beth and looked at her
as though she were his younger daughter, and advised her one by
one against the machinations of all the males, from Challis to
Ernie the Programme Boy.</p>

<p><br>
On long daylight jumps, some six or eight of the company would
always enter the car with books under their arms and with loud
protests of 'It makes me sore; I never get any time to read'. And
with that they would begin eight hours of play at bridge or
poker, on folding tables when they were favoured with Pullman
cars, on suitcases on their knees when they had only day
coaches.</p>

<p>Only Zed, Bethel, Douglas, Charlotte, Purvis, Andy, ever
really settled down to reading anything but tabloid newspapers or
picture magazines.</p>

<p>They who did not play cards talked (of the stage!) or slept,
fantastically curled in car seats. From time to time these
earnest sleepers were awakened by the cries of the bridge players
and the triumphant slap of cards, and turned and grunted and went
back to sleep.</p>

<p>Thus too they variously used their leisure in the hotels,
between shows. When they spent only one day in a town and left by
train at night, only Andy and Mrs. Boyle took hotel rooms. The
others roosted in Andy's place, and a whole series of young women
were to be heard, though not to be seen, innocently taking hot
baths in his bathroom.</p>

<p>But Bethel's true home was not in trains or hotels but in the
theatres themselves.</p>

<p><br>
She liked to be in her dressing-room early. It had the
security and the peace of a convent cell, and all its detachment
from the outer world. It was pleasant not to have to hurry; to
paddle about the room in her blue wool slippers, to sit before
her mirror, one bare foot swinging, carefully putting a red base
on her cheeks, and small touches of white along the side of her
nose&mdash;which otherwise would seem a bit too
small&mdash;patting it with a cool wet wad of cotton, smoothing
it, smoothing it; to sit and recall her lines as Epilogue; to run
over the Juliet part (some night, Mrs. Boyle <i>might</i> be
ill!) until the dressing-room changed, in Bethel's imagination,
from horse stall to palace.</p>

<p>She felt modestly and gratefully superior to all the dull
people at dinner outside&mdash;such serfs as bankers and
plumbers, school-teachers and clerks.</p>

<p>Outside, the voices of the arriving actors were cheery. Hilda
was ironing Mrs. Boyle's costumes and singing 'Kom' mit mir, du
kleine Prinzessin'. Zed was whistling the Brahms Fourth, down the
dressing-room alley. Mabel Staghorn was chirping, 'Come Pippy,
Pippy, Pippy'.</p>

<p>They were her family. She loved them all, for their gaiety,
their courage, their endurance, their devotion.</p>

<p>The odour called 'the smell of grease paint' grew thicker,
more enchanting. It was composed of face salves and powders,
eyebrow pencils, cold cream, cigarette smoke, silk, old dresses,
wigs, decayed flowers. Outside, the stage manager called 'Half-
hour', 'Fifteen minutes', 'Overture', then 'Places, please', like
an Old World watchman with his 'Two o'clock and all's
well'&mdash;a lingering, tender sound that made her nod in
security. Only the last, 'Places, please', startled her and
brought, for a moment, the familiar frightened sinking in the
stomach.</p>

<p>Then she was calmly, evenly as a cogwheel in a watch, moving
to the entrance. She was passing Doc Keezer, sitting on a
backless chair, nothing of him moving save his lips in smiling.
He could sit like that all through a performance, when he was not
on stage; waiting&mdash;for nothing. He whispered only 'Good
luck!'</p>

<p>Eldred, the stage manager, was waiting for her; he smiled;
with outstretched forefinger he gave her the signal; she slipped
through the draw curtain and stood between it and the drop
curtain; the drop rose, with its familiar low roar, like wind far
away; she was conscious of the golden glare of a spotlight
engulfing her eyes, and mysterious dimnesses beneath it where the
high lords of the audience were veiled from her, and she was
safely plunged, no more in panic, into the dear familiar
music:</p>

<br>


<p class="verse">

'Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>

In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>

From ancient grudge break to new mutiny...'</p>

<br>


<p>Then her first stint was done; she was sitting near Doc
Keezer, silent as he, till Romeo should come by&mdash;Romeo,
Andy, so handsomely swaggering in tweed jacket and grey bags and
careless cheery-coloured tie; and she went back to her dressing-
room, another evening begun safely.</p>

<p><br>
Once her dressing-room was on a balcony above the stage. As
she stood by the rail, looking down on the set, Hugh Challis
stopped beside her and reflected:</p>

<p>'Like a big sailing ship at sea, isn't it, down there? A ship
at night, good weather and clear stars. The cyclorama's like a
huge sail, so steady, going up into the darkness&mdash;you can't
see the top of it. And the set, with the light just dimly shining
through it, is the lighted cabin. The stage planks are the deck.
And we shall come safely to port&mdash;no fear!'</p>

<p>She could see it, though the nearest she had ever come to
ships was in the movies. Yes, the stage manager, sitting down
there behind the right tormentor, holding the script, their map,
and quietly following the lines as they ran smoothly on, was the
first officer or the pilot; the electrician, at his switchboard,
was an engineer. This must be a sailing ship with auxiliary
engines! The dialogue, coming distantly from on-stage, was a
steady, low sound, confident as a ship's soft throbbing...
and, like a ship, it all went on night on night on night...
the steady ship bearing her to glory... the voyage to
Verona.</p>

<p>That was the final quality of real actors, she saw; not so
much fantastic imagination, or neat imitation, or golden voices,
but the patience to go on, night on night, and never quite let
down. They never tired of the same play. They could always laugh
anew at the Nurse's jeering, at Capulet's tantrums, and when they
themselves slipped, when they 'fluffed', they came off-stage
grinning and with never-faded excitement whispered, 'Did you hear
me say "exiled" instead of "banished". Golly!'</p>

<p>Like all artists&mdash;all painters, all musicians, all poets,
even some of those plodding recorders, the novelists&mdash;actors
are glorious children, with a child's unwearied delight in the
same story over again, and the child's ability to make dragons
grow in a suburban garden, but with an adult magic of
crystallizing the daydreams into enduring life.</p>

<p><br>
Agreeably she waited each night for Doc Keezer's inevitable
curfew after the curtain call: 'Well, another day; another
dollar.' Agreeably she lost herself in the inevitable midnight
post-mortems which are the actor's chief reward.</p>

<p>Wherever they were, in cafeteria or Chinese restaurant, hotel
room or train, they went detail by detail over that night's
performance. 'Say, did you see the way Boyle pinched the
masquerade scene off Andy by standing back humming when he first
looks at her?' 'Was I sore at Harry Purvis! He was kidding all
through my duel with him!' 'What was wrong with Hugh to-night? He
was late on all his cues, and he almost blew in Thirty-five,
where he bawls Juliet out for weeping.'</p>

<p>It was the beloved repetition of lovers, of doctors; it was
the sweet, long, important talk of theologians in the monastery;
and like these other initiates, the actors resented laymen who
intruded on them at table with unlawful talk of the outside
world&mdash;laymen, non-professionals, whose heathen awfulness
could be realized only when they said 'practising' for
'rehearsing', or in deepest depravity asked, 'Does she <i>take
off</i> her part well?'</p>

<p>When the nightly details had been fully gone into, they could
always recall the time when Lyle was arrested by a traffic
policeman just before a performance, the time when Romeo's
trousers were stolen and he went on in gymnasium slacks, and
Mabel Staghorn's spraining of her ankle by stumbling over a stage
screw. She, equally the New Thoughter and the old trouper, played
with her ankle bandaged, and was heard to warble, when the ankle
was dressed, 'Oh no, dear, it doesn't hurt the teeniest, weeniest
bit, if you have faith in the Inner Resources&mdash;ouch, damn
it!'</p>

<p>Yes, thought Bethel, perhaps their shop talk was thinner than
the profundities of philosophers, but it was gayer, and more dear
to the frail human soul.</p>

<p><br>
For all their Pullmans and electric heaters in dressing-rooms,
they did not altogether lack the pioneering that the old-time
saints of trouping had known, when Hamlet rode atop the
stagecoach, through a snowstorm, in stovepipe hat and dogskin
coat.</p>

<p>They had snowstorms that delayed the curtain. They went
through the flu epidemic; Mrs. Boyle was almost carried on the
stage by her maid, and Andy played Romeo with a fever higher than
that of love.</p>

<p>All these emergencies Bethel found enchanting. But she noticed
that Andy was using them for what the business management of a
show calls 'the alibis'&mdash;the excuses to prove that a show is
not really a failure. The alibis for the Romeo company were
numerous. They had failed to have better houses not because
people didn't vastly like their play but because of:</p>

<p>The cold, which kept people home.</p>

<p>The thaw, which kept people home.</p>

<p>The flu epidemic.</p>

<p>The rival high-school basketball game in Waterloo.</p>

<p>The rival National Guard exhibition in Sioux Falls.</p>

<p>George Cohan's tour in <i>I'd Rather Be Right,</i> in which
the dean of American actors was, said Tertius Tully, taking away
all the show money there was in the country.</p>

<p>The fact that there hadn't been enough shows in this city
lately, so that people were out of the habit of theatre-
going.</p>

<p>The fact that there had been too many shows.</p>

<p>The fact that Andy was too chummy with reporters so that they
gave him no reverence.</p>

<p>The fact that Mrs. Boyle was too unfriendly with
reporters.</p>

<p>The fact that Mahala had worn red shoes at a Baptist church
supper.</p>

<p>The fact that Shakespeare was Shakespeare.</p>

<p><br>
The more the alibis, the more certain was Bethel that Andy was
continuing to lose money. But lose or not, she went sweeping
through her new America.</p>

<p>Waterloo and Des Moines and Cedar Rapids and Davenport and
Burlington and Omaha and Lincoln and Kansas City! Sedalia and
Columbia, Jefferson City and Springfield; Little Rock, in the
state of Arkansas that had seemed to her, from Connecticut, as
far away as Alaska; Memphis and the naive surprise that there
were more filling stations in the South than moonshiners, more
advertising men than colonels; the spacious and pleasant city of
St. Louis, royal city by the royal river; then into smaller and
smaller towns in Kansas.</p>

<p>From Omaha to Lincoln the company went in two buses. Mabel
Staghorn indicated that this was to save money, and she began to
worry about their future, but the bright young people loved it,
and as the huge green buses swayed through a land of small sturdy
cottages, lost in white vastness, they sang Noel Coward's ballad,
'Don't Put Your Daughter on the Stage, Mrs. Worthington'.</p>

<p><br>
The party started just after the performance on Christmas Eve,
in Cedar Rapids, and since Christmas was on a Sunday, continued
on the train and all the next day, in their hotel in Davenport.
On the train two days earlier, Andy had announced to the company
that he would be their host for Christmas, but he said, cheerily,
casually&mdash;only Bethel read anxiety underneath&mdash;'Let's
all be merry, but let's be economical, at least till the show
goes over. No presents from anybody to anybody, if you can help
it. And we'll stick to beer.'</p>

<p>Mahala flared up: 'Is that your idea of Christmas in Newport,
R.I.? Even in the chorus we'd get champagne. Romeo the
spendthrift!'</p>

<p>'The fool. That ends her!' quaked Bethel, and Charlotte and
Purvis exchanged glances. But Andy sounded bland:</p>

<p>'All right, if you feel that way, my dear. If it can be done.
Did you ever try to buy champagne in Cedar Rapids?'</p>

<p>He did. The train left for Davenport with Tudor Blackwall
waving a bottle of champagne and crying, 'Company, attention!
Corporals Swenson, Murphy and Keezer will distribute old Mother
Pullman's best paper champagne glasses! Fill 'em up, gents and
girls. You too, Comrade Purvis&mdash;to-night, at least. Now I'll
give you a toast! To Andy Deacon, the best boss and the best
friend an actor ever had! Skoal!'</p>

<p>They drank&mdash;none more cheerfully than Zed and Murphy and
Jeff Hoy, the rebels against Andy's style of producing.</p>

<p>From his drawing-room, Andy carried out a little silver tree.
Despite his own order, he had hung on it a tiny present for every
member of the cast and the stage crew: a gold pencil, engraved
'An old accustom'd feast, Xmas '38'. When the tree stood in the
aisle, on a porter's footstool, shaking and glittering in the
train's motion, when, holding high their paper cups dripping
champagne, the whole company chorused, 'Silent night, holy
night', then Bethel dropped inside her berth and wept, her eyes
against her arms.</p>

<p>It was her first Christmas away from Sladesbury and the big
tree in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>She loved her new family, though, and she forgot crying, sang
sentimental songs with all of them&mdash;till Tertius Tully,
usually the rock of discretion but now a little loose with
champagne, whispered to her, 'I hope Andy can pay for all this,
but we've been dropping a wad of money every night this last
week. Exeunt bearing corpses.'</p>

<p><br>
The loving-kindness of their Yuletide companionship had worn a
little thin and grey when they assembled for Christmas dinner
(donated by Mr. Andrew Deacon, the producer) in a private suite
in the hotel in Davenport.</p>

<p>They had none of them slept enough; they were homesick and
tired of pumping merriment; and Tony Murphy had started breakfast
with brandy in black coffee.</p>

<p>Bethel had been conscious of a waxing criticism of Andy and a
pessimism about the tour. The malcontents felt, variously, that
Andy was a shallow, unauthoritative actor, that the presentation
of the play was too contemporary, that it wasn't contemporary at
all, that Andy was paying Mrs. Boyle too much money&mdash;a
thousand a week against ten per cent of the gross, that he wasn't
paying the particular person then speaking (even if that person
happened to be Mrs. Boyle), anything like enough, that he was
losing so much money that he couldn't carry on, that Tertius and
he were falsifying the box-office statements and Andy hideously
expropriating them all and making money in car-loads.</p>

<p>But now, at this edgy Christmas dinner, Bethel was able
clearly to pick out the rebels.</p>

<p>Before the long Christmas afternoon was over, before the
Scotch and port had stopped circling, as everybody moved from
place to place about the huge table in the suite the malcontents
were tending to sit together and, thus emboldened, to be openly
doubtful of the weary charms of Andy. The sharpest conspirators
were, she saw, Zed, Antonio Murphy, Geoffrey Hoy and Lyle
Johnson, that Balthasar with the bark on.</p>

<p>Tony and Lyle could be discounted. They were the sea lawyers
of the company; the inevitable complainers; the kind of mutineers
who earnestly believed that this theatrical producer Andrew
Deacon, born in 1910, had deliberately designed the smothering
dressing-rooms of a theatre built in 1895.</p>

<p>But Jeff Hoy&mdash;Benvolio&mdash;was a man of competence, of
technique and reason. He was the grim comedian. He never gave
another actor a wrong cue, a kind word or a dollar. Acting was
his business, and he paid his spiritual debts and collected his
artistic bills with tight accuracy. He had never liked any other
member of any theatrical company in his seventeen years (ever
since he was twenty) on the stage, and had never been interested
enough in any of them to dislike them. He was as courteous as an
executioner, and in his handsome eyes there was no human feeling,
no human weakness, no human love. He was married to a stately
woman who was the daughter of a lieutenant governor of Ontario
and who despised all Americans, all Canadians, all Englishmen and
all actors. Jeff Hoy agreed with her in everything.</p>

<p>Not so resolutely mutinous as Jeff, but a little doubtful of
Andy and very doubtful of the tour's long continuance were
Douglas Fry, Iris, Harry Purvis, and Charlotte, Victor Swenson... and Mahala Vale.</p>

<p>Loyal to Andy in everything, never believing in him so much
and so adoringly as when they disbelieved, were only Hugh
Challis, Mabel and Doc, Tudor Blackwall, Nathan Eldred, Vera
Cross, Tom Wherry... and all the stagehands... and Tertius
Tully... and Bethel Merriday.</p>

<p>It shook Bethel enough, at this Christmas feast, to find that
the competent Mr. Jeff Hoy was allied with the plotters, but what
crushed her was the sudden evidence that the cloistered Mrs.
Lumley Boyle could have any opinion whatever on any matter
whatever aside from her salary and playing centre stage, and that
this new opinion of hers was that the tour was going to blow up,
and she didn't care much if the explosion came soon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyle had, at first, declined to come to the dinner. But
perhaps sitting alone with Hilda Donnersberg and with thoughts of
Devon mulled wine, in a mouldy hotel suite on Christmas Day, was
too much for her. She appeared just after the turkey came
on&mdash;and she was about one-quarter drunk.</p>

<p>'Sit by me,' said Andy. But Mrs. Boyle looked swiftly over the
assembly&mdash;far more men than women&mdash;and, as fluttery as
a girl on Saturday afternoon at a summer resort, she swished over
to young Lyle Johnson and youngish Jeff Hoy, gurgling to Andy,
'Oh, darling, let me take this wonderful opportunity of knowing
some of the boys I haven't played so much with.'</p>

<p>Lyle and Jeff set a chair for her between them.</p>

<p>Bethel, not far down the table, thought she heard Hoy growl at
Mrs. Boyle, 'Why didn't you say to him, "Wherefore the hell art
<i>thou</i> Romeo?"' She certainly heard Mrs. Boyle giggle, then
yelp at a waiter, 'Whisky-soda, and do be generous for once, Herr
Ober.'</p>

<p>It was a rather makeshift dining place. The large table was
made up of half a dozen tables of not quite the same height, so
that the topography was mountainous and you went uphill from
pumpkin pie to mince pie to plum pudding to candied orange peel.
The tables so crowded the suite that you had to squeeze between
the wall and the chairs, which varied from a saddle-back chair to
a piano bench. On the walls, green below and pink above, were
pictures of the various state governors who had graced the
suite.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyle, never more than one-half drunk and certainly never
less, was lavish. She told Hoy that he would give new life to the
London stage, if he would ever condescend to go there. She told
Tony Murphy that his humour was in the 'classic tradition'. She
told Purvis and Charlotte&mdash;now lovingly sitting in one
chair&mdash;that Andy had not had 'the imagination to comprehend
the aristocratic significance of <i>Romeo and Juliet'.</i> They
bubbled back at her, and Hoy told the 'raw one, but I'm sure you
can stand it', about the preacher and the woman missionary, and
Lyle whooped, and kissed Mrs. Boyle&mdash;which, on any day save
December 25th, was as improbable as his kissing Queen
Wilhelmina&mdash;and she kissed him back.</p>

<p><br>
Mrs. Boyle's relationship to the continuation of the run of
the play was different from that of any other member of the
company. She had a 'run-of-the-play contract', whereby she could
neither quit nor be discharged except by common agreement between
her and Andy, under penalty of the thunders of Equity. She might
dislike everything about the show&mdash;and in Aurelia Boyle
there were truly great powers of disliking&mdash;but she could
not, the lone, lorn, exiled Pluto could not, return to New York
without Andy's willingness. It was a horrid case of the
capitalistic oppression of the intellectual proletariat.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Boyle was surrounded by merriment at one end of the
table, at the other Andy and his palace guard grew momently more
grave and silent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyle began effervescently to take them all, the young
and provincial, into the sacred places of English stage life.
Laughing, friendly, making fun of herself, she told them how Sir
Johnston Forbes-Robertson had taught her that no one had learned
how to walk across a stage so long as any observer could recall
the way in which she had walked; how she had been reintroduced to
Mrs. Patrick Campbell seven times&mdash;five of them, Mrs.
Campbell had pretended not to remember her name, the sixth, she
had pretended that Mrs. Boyle was named Blievazatski, and on the
seventh had sighed, 'But you can't be Ellen Terry'.</p>

<p>By now, the temptress had everyone but Andy, Bethel, Hugh
Challis and Mahala.</p>

<p>She sighed along the table, and in the voice of the Lorelei
called, 'Dear Miss Vale, do come down here. I want to tell you
how very charming I think you have made Lady Capulet.'</p>

<p>Mahala went. She might have returned to the folds of
righteousness, but suddenly Zed Wintergeist, who had been
drinking, discovered Mahala as a new adventure. He put his arm
about her with infuriating casualness. He took enough interest in
her to be rude to her. He said that it was a shame that Mahala,
obviously the most beautiful and flexible of all actresses next
to Mrs. Boyle, was yet so lazy that she didn't settle down to
work and show up all the young leading women of her own
vintage.</p>

<p>Mahala simpered.</p>

<p>At the Boyle end of the table the chairs were now two deep and
the conversation tenfold. At the other, Andy and Bethel and
Challis and Tertius sat solemn among empty chairs. Andy tried to
look satisfied with his party, and he interrupted a long Challis
story to mutter, 'I suppose I ought to make some kind of a little
speech'.</p>

<p>Bethel wanted to beg, 'Oh, don't'. Before she could get
started on it, Andy was up and, while the heathen end of the
table looked embarrassed or derisive, he struggled, 'Before we
have a chance to break up, I want to tell you that this has been
the greatest Christmas of my life, and I'm sure that all of us
will say that, next to the chance of spending the day at our own
hearthsides, we have found this the best bunch of friends and co-
workers that has ever been known, so, with Tiny Tim&mdash;or was
it Alexander Woollcott?&mdash;let us say, "God bless us
everyone".'</p>

<p>Bethel was never quite certain whether Mrs. Boyle interrupted
him or just capped him, but their embarrassment glided away on
her voice, soft as across wide waters, singing 'D'ye ken John
Peel?' It was a hunting song and then a lullaby and then the
inexplicable magic of her homesickness for Devonshire
mornings.</p>

<p>When Bethel turned from the singer, she found that Andy was
gone. She sprang up, blundered away without tactfulness. She knew
where Andy's room was&mdash;who could have missed his laughter
that Christmas morning?</p>

<p>Perhaps to make up for the feast, Andy had taken the cheapest
room in the hotel. She tapped at his door and, unanswered, peeped
in. The room was primitive: a brass single bed, a bureau, one
chair, an unshaded electric bulb. Most of Andy's luggage was
piled outside in the hall, and his imperial black-and-gold
dressing-gown lay bunched on the gritty matting on the floor. She
saw all this only in pity; for Andy lay on the bed, face down on
the pillow.</p>

<p>She sat on the bedside; stroked his hair. He looked up
angrily. He looked fifty years old, and grey. Then he smiled. He
took her hand, tucked it under his cheek, and again buried his
face. For minutes they talked thus, without words,
comfortingly.</p>

<p>He sat up abruptly, his arm lightly about her. He said, 'Shall
I give up the tour?'</p>

<p>'Oh no-no!'</p>

<p>'Most of the gang are discouraged. They blame me for
everything. That's all right&mdash;that's my job as producer, I
guess. After all, if we went over big, it'd be me who'd get the
profit. They think the show is a flop.'</p>

<p>'I don't!'</p>

<p>'Well, I'll stick as long as just one person believes in
me&mdash; especially if that one person is you, because&mdash;Oh
well, I remember the case of firing Mr. Nooks! That is, I'll
stick it as long as I have one cent left, though&mdash;'</p>

<p>There was an astonishing change. He broke instantly, and his
round face was bewildered.</p>

<p>'Why do they all buck me so? I can stand audiences not being
so crazy about me, but when my own fellow-troupers let me
down&mdash;I'm going to chuck it!'</p>

<p>'Fight 'em!' She heard herself as strident and demanding as a
battling old woman. 'You've been too good to 'em. They all take
advantage of you. You're too apologetic to 'em. If <i>you</i>
keep saying you're an amateur, what do you expect <i>them</i> to
say?'</p>

<p>'I can't stand ill will around me.'</p>

<p>'Oh, are you a child? Have you got to be coddled? Have you
always got to stay in Newport, with the dear old loving nurse,
and in Yale, with the dear old loving senior society members?
You're out in the world now, Andy, and people aren't so awfully
sweet. I'm ashamed of you, my dear!'</p>

<p>She was astonished. To have talked thus to her Sun God!</p>

<p>He spoke, and he sounded confident again:</p>

<p>'Yes. You're right. Thanks! I just needed a shot in the arm.
I'll go on. But Beth, tell me&mdash;I haven't anybody except you
and Tertius that I can really talk to, on the level. Did you feel
this afternoon that there's a kind of organized conspiracy now to
crab the show?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'With Zed and Tony and Jeff the chief assassins?'</p>

<p>'Yes. You might try firing the whole lot of 'em.'</p>

<p>'Even Zed?'</p>

<p>'Sure.'</p>

<p>'I thought you were pretty strong for him.'</p>

<p>'I am. I think he's a fine actor. And honest. But he's so
young.' (Venerable, wan, world-weary Bethel!) 'He's a spoiled
brat. If he doesn't get his own way exactly, he has a tantrum and
lies on his back and kicks.'</p>

<p>Andy fretted. Yes, I wouldn't mind his being pretty rough on
me personally, if it didn't affect his acting, but of course his
work&mdash;the work of most of 'em&mdash;is going off. They're
just saying lines.'</p>

<p>'I doubt if Zed realizes that. Why don't you have a knockdown
talk with him, Andy?'</p>

<p>'He wouldn't listen to me. Why don't you?'</p>

<p>This time she was not astonished that he turned to her, and it
was with all gravity that she consoled him, 'I'll see if I can't.
But Andy, do you realize the real trouble we've got ahead? Mrs.
Boyle! She'll join the conspiracy.'</p>

<p>'Never. She's a conscientious artist.'</p>

<p>'Is she? She's also a woman, and she wants every advantage for
Pluto. If she thinks the tour won't succeed, she'll want to get
back to New York before it's too late to get another job this
season, and we can look for some pretty fine tour-ending and
play-busting tricks on Aurelia's part.'</p>

<p>'You really think so?'</p>

<p>And stoutly, very maturely, she said, 'I really do.'</p>

<p>Among all the celebrated crises of burgeoning youth, first
dancing, first powerful oration in school, first money earned,
first love that comes from another human being and not from
books, one triumph has gone unsung: the first time that an adult
takes your advice seriously. With a sageness at which neither of
them laughed, she theorized:</p>

<p>'Zed and Douglas just have vague feelings that they don't like
the method of production. Tony Murphy doesn't ever like anything.
But Boyle, and maybe Jeff Hoy, want to get home without having it
on record that they've been fired. Oh, you will fight them,
Andy?'</p>

<p>He was turning his head to the pillow again. 'Yes. Because
you're such a true woman. But&mdash;I am so tired.'</p>

<p>That Christmas night, in a strange town, she walked the
streets half the evening.</p>

<p>If this tour closed, would she ever have another
engagement&mdash;ever have the luck of finding another royal and
job-bearing Andy? Would she be just a girl back home in
Sladesbury, boasting to bored friends of having 'once been on the
stage myself', and hoping that a Charley Hatch&mdash;almost any
Charley Hatch&mdash;would marry her?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

<p class="first">DURING the holiday week, between Davenport and
Kansas City, Bethel was not certain whether Mrs. Boyle had
consciously joined the conspiracy of failure. But she was certain
enough that Mrs. Boyle was drinking too much. She arrived at the
theatre sober and soreheaded; by the beginning of the last act,
she was superb; but she left the theatre benign and domestic-
looking and quite drunk.</p>

<p>Night on night (Andy was frank enough with Bethel now) they
were losing money, and neither of them knew quite what to do
about it. If the malcontents were not acting so well, it showed
only in the slowness and lacklustre of the play.</p>

<p>Bethel's one blow was in Doc Keezer, Mabel, Purvis, and
Charlotte. Very mysterious, feeling herself a fixer and a
diplomat, practically a female Basil Zaharoff, she got these four
into the Purvises' room at Omaha, after their morning arrival.
She felt confident. When she had been waiting her turn for a
taxicab that morning, on arrival, the December day had been so
fresh and brave and sunlit; from the plaza before the Union
Station she had looked down on the tracks and on locomotives
casting up a coil of bright smoke into bright air.</p>

<p>She fussily got her four statesmen seated on the bed, gave
them cigarettes, and said enthusiastically, 'Look: this is a
public meeting. I want us all to do something big&mdash;get
together and see if we can't save the Romeo tour. I know we all
love Andy&mdash;'</p>

<p>Harry Purvis yawned, 'Not enough to work miracles for him, and
only a miracle will save this tour. I give it four more
weeks.'</p>

<p>'You honestly think so?' wailed Bethel.</p>

<p>'Well, maybe three,' said Charlotte happily.</p>

<p><i>'Or</i> two,' smiled Doc Keezer.</p>

<p>'But don't any of you <i>care?'</i> demanded Bethel.</p>

<p>'Why?' wondered Doc. 'It's just another flop. I've been in
dozens of 'em. Andy's a good guy, but why all the fuss? We'll
hustle back to New York and get busy looking for another
job&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And that's that,' said Mabel Staghorn, comfortably.</p>

<p>'You don't see something special about this
production&mdash;making <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> real and
important?' said Bethel.</p>

<p>'It's just another show,' said Doc.</p>

<p>'Just another show,' said Mabel.</p>

<p>'I'd like to hear Toscanini in New York,' said Purvis.</p>

<p>'My baby shall,' purred Charlotte.</p>

<p>And then did Bethel disgrace herself, and blow up with a wail
of 'Oh, I hate you, all of you! I hate you!'</p>

<p>What they said then, lengthily and affectionately, can be
summed up as There there, you're a dear child, never mind, we'll
all have dinner together when we blessedly get back to New
York.</p>

<p>She bounced off to her own room, flaming, but she didn't even
unpack, or wash her face. She telephoned down for the number of
Mr. Zed Wintergeist's room. She would go there, right now, and
keep her promise to Andy, and eloquently win Zed over to
righteousness.</p>

<p>But she stopped in front of the blank grained pine of his
door.</p>

<p>No. She couldn't do it: she was being a busybody, intrusively
busy about good works, and she hated women who were like that.
And you didn't go lightly into Zed's room. Mahala and Iris and
she popped innocently enough and frequently into Andy's
apartment, and no one thought anything of seeing him wandering
down every corridor in pyjamas. But the intense Zed was not like
that. No.</p>

<p>She turned away, and in her room she cried a little.</p>

<p>That afternoon Andy summoned her. 'Well, kit, you were right.
I've just had a talk with Mrs. Boyle. She'd like to break her
run-of-the-play contract. I wouldn't do it. She didn't say much,
but she was pretty bleak. So I saw Hoy and Murphy&mdash;I'm
leaving Zed to you, you know.'</p>

<p>'Uh-yes,' said Bethel, uncomfortably.</p>

<p>'And they both&mdash;they didn't exactly give me a two weeks'
notice, but they both admitted that they think the tour's going
to blow up and they don't much care, and I'm a parlour player.
Swine!</p>

<br>


<p class="verse">

"God's bread! it makes me mad.<br>

Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play<br>

Alone, in company, still my care hath been<br>

To&mdash;"</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em;">to keep their jobs going, to keep
the play going, and they won't even gamble with me for a few
weeks.'</p>

<p>'We'll beat them yet!' cried Bethel.</p>

<p>'Ye-es,' said Andy.</p>

<p>She marched now relentlessly to Zed's room. He was in. She
found him lying on his bed, like a jack-knife, his legs up
against the wall, reading <i>Coriolanus</i> aloud, gently waving
one foot in time to the beat of the lines. He went on a moment
after he had shouted 'C'm in' and she had entered. Then he looked
up at her, amused.</p>

<p>It was just a little odd, standing back of him, seeing his
face thus, upside down. Faces upside down are disconcerting and
not altogether endearing. She let him have it. It was Coriolanus
who spoke, as much as she:</p>

<p>'I just dropped in to tell you that you are a coward and a
traitor, and that you are willing to ruin an honest theatrical
experiment to butter your own vanity.'</p>

<p>He whirled around all in one piece, like a top, and came to,
sitting on the edge of the bed, glaring at her. 'I'm a
<i>what?'</i></p>

<p>'You're an amateur actor!'</p>

<p>'Whatever you can call me, that's the one thing I won't
stand!'</p>

<p>'You can't even endure discipline. You're the typical ham.
You're willing to ruin the whole play if you don't get what you
think you want.'</p>

<p>'My good Merriday, when you come out of this dramatic scene
you're throwing, I imagine I'll find you're referring to the fact
that I think our presentation of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> has been
atrociously misdirected and mismanaged from the beginning, and
that I'm quite willing to see it terminated, even to the
considerable disadvantage of my own pocket-book, and if you call
<i>that</i> being an amateur, why&mdash;why&mdash;you're
crazy!'</p>

<p>She didn't remember ever being asked to sit down, but she was
sitting on a straight chair, looking at him sitting on the side
of a reproduction mahogany colonial bed. The room was small,
tight, but neat as a candy box, and the wall was a temperate
grey. She felt that for years now she had been talking to people
who sat on the edges of brass beds, maple beds, mahogany beds,
iron beds, Pullman berths. Had the whole world turned to sitting
on the edges of beds and being querulous? Had chairs gone out?
Did anyone anywhere still lie under the shade of trees and seem
human?</p>

<p>'So you think it's all misdirected?' she was saying. 'And just
how would <i>you</i> direct it?'</p>

<p>'I'd make it really modern. What do the clothes matter, if
Andy keeps the whole feeling phony and bookish&mdash;the whole
reading of the lines? Youngsters to-day love just as passionately
as any blasted Elizabethans, but they have humour, and a
realization that everything in the world has double and triple
meanings, and that if you tell a gal her face is a lotus flower,
you'd better be wary about your metaphor or it may fly up and
trip you, for God knows what the lotus flower may mean to Freud!
I'd have Romeo throw away a line like "Yon grey is not the
morning's eye, 'tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's
brow"&mdash;say it lightly, and not croon it like the prayer-
book, the way Andy does. He reads like an elocutionist. Orson
Welles and Co. made <i>Julius Caesar</i> sound like human beings
really being sore and scared. And Maurice Evans's
<i>Hamlet&mdash;</i>remember what a glorious female fool Mady
Christians made of the Queen? No, of course you don't remember
it! The only real play you've ever seen in your life was some
tryout in Hartford. You're a pure little college girl from a fine
old farmhouse o'erlooking the Connecticut River, and you think
that a Saint Francis in tweed pants like Andy Deacon, that holds
the record for chinning himself in the Y.M.C.A., is the hope of a
newer and nobler drama with a moral lesson&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Zed! You've done a better job than you have any idea. You
started making fun of Andy. You've ended by ruining him.'</p>

<p>'He's ruined himself, by not having any dramatic sense.'</p>

<p>'He's done <i>something,</i> while you just sit back and
grouch.'</p>

<p>'You sound like the wife of a popular publicity-grabbing
clergyman, defending him.'</p>

<p>'Whatever you think of Andy, he's put every cent and every
ounce of energy he has into this tour, and now that you've made
him ridiculous, you've enabled Mrs. Boyle, that queen of the
cats&mdash;'</p>

<p>'She sure is!'</p>

<p>'&mdash;to show her proper contempt for all of us&mdash;poor
American amateurs&mdash;and kill her contract by ruining the
whole show. She won't have to do much. You and that great
comedian Tony Murphy have sneered at all of us so effectively
that everybody's self-conscious and afraid to cut loose and do
some vivid acting, and the show's flat as ditch-water, thanks to
you&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Thanks to <i>me?!</i>'</p>

<p>'&mdash;and so now your fellow-conspirator, Mrs. Boyle, has
only to step in and do a few sloppy performances and we're
finished. Yes, you didn't like Andy. So you betrayed him for the
great Mrs. Aurelia Lumley Boyle!'</p>

<p>'Now by God I won't stand your&mdash;Even if you are a
girl&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, I'll go back to the pure old homestead by the
Connecticut. You bet I will! I came on this tour terribly fond of
Andy, for his sweetness, as I still am, but feeling that it was
an opportunity to work with a really creative actor like you, and
you prove to be another smart amateur that hasn't the temperament
to be a serious actor, that's just playing at it before he goes
off to his proper hideaway in Hollywood.'</p>

<p>'I'm going to choke you&mdash;I really am going to choke you
to death, Merriday. Nobody can insult me like that and live.'</p>

<p>'To think that I once admired you more than anybody on
earth!'</p>

<p>'You certainly never showed any signs of it! I could have gone
for you big. I think maybe you have some of the real fire, under
your layers of women's college and butterscotch sundae.'</p>

<p>They were not sitting now; he had sprung up, lifted her to her
feet; and his soul was no longer lying on its back and waving its
spiritual feet. He was frantically earnest and young:</p>

<p>'I liked you, but you were such a baby, and I didn't want to
make a fool of myself&mdash;funny, isn't it?&mdash;much safer to
be naive and longing with a wise woman of forty than with an airy
brat of twenty! But you really did believe in me?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'And you really think I let you down?'</p>

<p>'Yes. You did let me down, Zed.'</p>

<p>He was, after all, only a year older than she, this embryo
dictator, and she realized, as he put his arm about her with an
embrace too trembling to be anything but sincere, that he was
near to bawling like a baby.</p>

<p>'Oh, I never thought I could do that, pet. Tell me, oh, tell
me honestly, darling, no kidding, do you really mean that the
Boyle is trying to bust the tour, and I was her stooge?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'That old witch! When I come to think of it, I hate her more
than anybody else I know, because she <i>can</i> act, and doesn't
care. She can simply lure your heart out, when she gives that
slow, scared half-turn and says, "Trust me, gentleman, I'll prove
more true than those that have more cunning to be
strange"&mdash;she's twice as young as you are, then! Yet she'd
give it up for a country-house comedy. She's a traitor. Oh, we'll
squash her! Come. Let's go see Andy. He and you and I will put
this tour over, Beth! Come on!'</p>

<p>'Now I love you, Zed!'</p>

<p>He stopped, on the way to the door. He said sharply, 'How
literally do you mean that?'</p>

<p>'W-why?' was her answer.</p>

<p>'You knew I began to fall for you, after I got over being a
fool about Iris?'</p>

<p>'I don't think you really fell.'</p>

<p>'Why do you hold back so with me?'</p>

<p>'You haven't one tiniest little bit of kindness for women. You
order them around like waiters.'</p>

<p>'Of course I do. Every epicure orders waiters around and bawls
'em out&mdash;just because he cares for his food. It's only the
thick-ear that'd just as soon have pork chop as grouse that calls
the waiter "George" and asks about his health instead of about
his sauces... Are you going to fall in love with me?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Not even to save this tour?'</p>

<p>'Don't be so conceited again! How do you know you can save
it?'</p>

<p>'I'll show you. I'll do it. And then I may discourse with thee
sweet numbers, pet, of love. Come on!'</p>

<p>They hastened, hand in hand, to Andy's room. Between his own
door and Andy's, three floors above, the nimble Zed had evolved a
plan.</p>

<p>Andy's room was, again, the cheapest in the house; cheaper
than Zed's, with an aspen instead of an iron bed. When they
knocked, he gave them 'Come in', but when they entered he was
telephoning... long-distance telephoning.</p>

<p>The worst vice of Mr. Andrew Deacon was telephoning,
preferably to as distant a spot at as expensive a rate as was
possible. When in doubt, he reached for a receiver. He was one of
a whole new race of executives who take out their escapism not in
liquor or South Seas or war, but by instantly transporting
themselves across the continent. They may economize on salaries
and socks, they may be stay-at-homes, but they will rise up at
three a.m. and leap at a telephone instrument and call up some
poor unfortunate girl downily asleep in her own decent bed in a
city a thousand miles away.</p>

<p>They will have no time to write letters, no, not so much as a
postcard with a picture of the Empire State Building, but they
will with complaisance spend three hours tracking some distant
quarry from home to office to restaurant to theatre to places
where he decidedly ought not to be.</p>

<p>And of these telephoniacs, Andy was a chronic case. He
telephoned greetings to actors on their opening nights, thereby
forcing them to go out to the box office and almost miss their
first entrances; he telephoned filial greetings to his mother
when she was at crises in bridge games; he telephoned to sick
friends in the hospital, just at the times in their lives when
they most wanted to be left alone. But to-day he had more
apparent reason for telephoning.</p>

<p>As Bethel unavoidably listened to the end of the call he was
making, she guessed that he was trying to get more backing for
the show from some friend in the East... and that he had been
making this effort often and recently.</p>

<p><i>'...</i> oh yes, it's picking up. I get reports of a
swell advance sale all through Kansas... Why of course, I
expect to run at a loss for some time yet, till the country gets
sold on a novelty... No, I can't guarantee a thing. I won't
fool you about that. But all I can say is, I'm putting in all I
got... Well, think it over and I'll phone you again to-
morrow.'</p>

<p>He looked up from the telephone as brightly as though he had
just heard that the Daughters of Israel had taken a block of two
hundred seats.</p>

<p>Zed struck quickly. He stalked to Andy holding out his
hand.</p>

<p>'Listen, boss; Bethel has been jumping my neck, and I guess
she's right. I'm opposed to you on some of your theories of
production. I've never concealed that. But I never realized that
my criticism had played into the hands of a gang like Tony and
Jeff, that are natural sourballs, and I certainly never realized
it could give aid and comfort to mankind's natural enemy, Aurelia
Boyle.'</p>

<p>(As Zed continues with his surrender to the beaming Andy, who
pats his sleeve in gratitude, it should be noted that Bethel is
so remarkable a linguist that she perfectly understands, though
she cannot fluently speak it, the astoning new language of Zed,
Andy and Lyle, whose vocabulary contains such words of unknown
etymology as phony, stooge, blow, flop, wow, bust, and okay.)</p>

<p>'So here's my idea, Andy,' Zed was finishing. 'You've worked
the radio and interviews and hens' luncheons pretty hard, and
some of the colleges, but we haven't touched the high schools and
normal schools, and there's where the cash customers for
Shakespeare ought to be. If you want, and if Bethel will back me
up and Tertius will get me the dates, I'll make some spirited
addresses in high-school auditoriums. God knows I'll hate it, but
I swear, I'll coo you as gently as I can, and maybe it'll
help.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that's swell, Zed. I certainly appreciate it. I think
it's a swell idea. It's too late for this and next week, but I'll
wire&mdash;no, I better telephone&mdash;and get you dates for our
seventh and eighth and ninth weeks&mdash;Missouri and Kansas and
Colorado. I can't tell you how this touches me, Zed.'</p>

<p>They made a family portrait&mdash;Andy with his arms about his
two children, Zed and Bethel.</p>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>

<p class="first">KANSAS CITY, which is in Missouri and not in
Kansas, and which was the terminus of the Santa Fe trail and the
arena of Yankee Abolitionists and Pro-slavery riders, is one of
the remarkable cities of the United States. But to Bethel
Merriday, on the gloomy first to the fourth of January 1939,
Kansas City was the Golgotha where the <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
company first met unconcealable disaster.</p>

<p>It was not only meagre, unconvinced audiences; it was Mrs.
Boyle.</p>

<p>On New Year's Day, on Sunday in Kansas City, Mrs. Boyle was
drinking by midmorning. Naturally, there was no one large feast,
if Andy did not give it, but there were a dozen small ones, with
Scotch and White Rock in tooth-mugs and paper cups in bedrooms.
Andy himself impressively dressed up in morning coat and striped
trousers and attended church with Mahala, who liked that sort of
thing once a year. Bethel sat and did a good deal of small
weeping, in between letters home. In Lyle Johnson's room, next to
hers with both hall doors open, she could hear Lyle and Mrs.
Boyle and Jeff Hoy and Harry Purvis and Tony Murphy and,
surprisingly, the new Apothecary, Jones Awkwright, telling
stories and singing 'The Old Man Came Rolling Home'. She heard
Zed join them, and distinctly heard him hold forth:</p>

<p>'No, I <i>won't</i> have a drink. I'm on the water wagon...
Eh? As of right now! Harry&mdash;Jeff&mdash;I want to run through
the Death of Tybalt scene. We're doing it too mechanically....
You won't, eh? Then to hell with you. You're getting so you play
like a stock company, all of you, including me.... What? Oh
no, Mrs. Boyle, I couldn't possibly mean <i>you&mdash;</i>how
could I!'</p>

<p>That's what Bethel heard.</p>

<p>He came into her room and sat down&mdash;by some amazing lapse
of direction not on the edge of the bed, but just on the floor,
in the corner, his knees up to his chin, looking twelve years old
and sulky. They stared at each other for some time. He grumbled,
'They've got the right idea. I think I'll go out and get
cockeyed. No, I haven't even got the spirit to do that. You're
certainly a hell of a girl to think about falling in love with.
You're so pink and white and black, so respectable, so milk-sick,
so fussy, so generally Yankee, I <i>mean</i> it.'</p>

<p>He bounced out. She could see his rough, quick-changing face,
his strong hands, after he had left the room. Oh, why couldn't he
have taken her to the movies, at least, this lonely New Year's
Day?</p>

<p>She did go to the movies, with Purvis and Charlotte, that
evening, and she told herself that she was homesick for the
Fletcher Hewitt who would have had surprises and kindness for her
on her holiday in exile.</p>

<p>But her mind's eye could see only Zed.</p>

<p><br>
Late that afternoon and all that evening, Mrs. Boyle was not
to be seen or heard, but there were rumours that she had gone to
a very wet party in the Country Club district, and been convoyed
home at four a.m.</p>

<p>Bethel was, as Mrs. Boyle's understudy, supposed to look in on
her dressing-room at seven-thirty, and when she did so on Monday
evening, the first of their three performances in Kansas City,
she found the star blank and doubtful, with a bottle of Scotch on
her dressing-table.</p>

<p>Ever since Zed had called her a 'tattler' and 'teacher's pet',
Bethel had hated going to Andy with reports. She had to, now.</p>

<p>Andy cursed&mdash;much better than he was wont to. He
penetrated the star's dressing-room with an awkward excuse about
props, and reported to Bethel, standing aquiver in the dressing-
room alley, that 'the old girl is certainly a little soused, but
she's so well trained, I think she'll get through'.</p>

<p>She did. The only remarkable thing about Mrs. Boyle's
performance that evening was its ponderous sobriety. She made
Juliet as dull as the minutes of a house committee. And after the
show, when Lyle Johnson ventured in to invite her for a drink,
she was to be heard demanding, in tones ministerial but fuzzy,
'Who may you be? I am a leading lady. I never shaw you before. I
am not cushomed to associate with minor members of my
company'.</p>

<p>At one in the morning, as Bethel lay on her bed, reading, Andy
telephoned:</p>

<p>'Beth? Come quick. No, not bad news <i>exactly&mdash;</i>maybe
not.'</p>

<p>She found him exalted with disaster.</p>

<p>'The Boyle is not only drunk but promises to go on all night.
She's down in the Old Canteen Room. When I saw her last, she was
dancing the tango, except that she was rendering it as the St.
Vitus Dance.'</p>

<p>'With who?'</p>

<p>'Lyle Johnson... He says she called him up at midnight and
bawled him out for not keeping some boozing date she seemed to
think they had made. I tried to get her to go to bed. She told
me&mdash;oh well, why remember that? I can't get her arrested. I
certainly would if I could. She'll never be able to play Juliet
to-morrow night. You'll have to, Beth darling. And it's your
great chance!'</p>

<p>The understudy who, by tradition, should have hurrahed at her
slow-coming 'great chance' was appalled.</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't know. I don't know if I can. The part is so long.
I'm scared to death!'</p>

<p>'You've got to. And you will. And well.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I will try, if I have to.'</p>

<p>'Of course you will. I'm going to cue you all night long. I've
taken a suite down the hall for it... Hm!' He laughed at
himself. 'I guess I was glad of an excuse to get out of this
hard-times room. Come on. We'll order up some coffee and
begin.'</p>

<p>Mahala's voice, just then, at the door:</p>

<p>'Andy, are you still awake? Come on down and buy me some
grub.'</p>

<p>And, when he opened the door, Mahala's presence, lovely in coy
blue organdie with white cuffs and collar.</p>

<p>But Bethel was suddenly thinking that when she had first seen
Mahala, descending from the train at Grampion Centre, only six
months ago, she had seemed a great lady, a fabulous actress,
while now she was just another girl in the touring company...
prettier than most, but not beautiful like Charlotte, not radiant
like Mrs. Boyle.</p>

<p>Mahala glided in, looked astounded at Bethel's presence,
said&mdash;oh, you know, just what Mahala Vale or Mabel Staghorn
would have said: 'I hope I'm not interrupting.' Significantly,
you know.</p>

<p>'Very pleasantly,' purred Andy. 'Keep this strictly under your
hat, but the Boyle is boiled and Beth may have to play Juliet to-
morrow night. And I've got an idea. Prob'ly be a good thing if
she got cued all night. You start in with it, and I'll get a
couple hours' sleep, and then I'll take over and give the third
degree to the poor darling the rest of the night.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you and the "poor darling" seem to be quite happy without
me. I wouldn't intrude, not for words, I mean, not for worlds. I
hope you have a happy night!'</p>

<p>Afterward, Andy said only, 'I agree with you! I don't know how
I got the Mahala habit. They're putting it in cigarettes now, you
know... Come on, to work, dear.'</p>

<p>Shaking, sick, while he kept hurling her cues at her and
making her go on steadily, without a recess, through the huge
long speeches, Bethel went over the Juliet part till
dawn&mdash;at first sitting in a large chair, cool and amused,
trying to look like a veteran actress, like Mahala; at the last,
leaning her cheek against Andy's sturdy shoulder and whimpering
while, more savage than Zed, Andy kept whipping her on.</p>

<p>She slept till noon and awoke too tired to wonder whether she
was really going to the gallows that night.</p>

<p>She was. Andy reported that Mrs. Boyle was in her room, abed
and yelling for cognac.</p>

<p>Before Bethel was out of bed, Andy and Hugh Challis and Mabel
and Charlotte and Harry Purvis and Iris&mdash;the last a delicate
green of incredulous envy&mdash;were all jammed into the room,
offering to help: 'Get out of here, all of you, and I'll order
the child some coffee and start a little slave-driving again,'
said Andy, affectionately.</p>

<p>For the first time in a week, he seemed his old, gay,
adventurous self.</p>

<p>The others had scarce gone, and Bethel was just sitting up, a
modest grey blanket thick about her shoulders, when Zed galloped
in.</p>

<p>'This is great! Now you'll have your chance, Beth,' he
exulted. 'To-night a new Star is born! You'll wow them. Maybe you
won't be as smooth as Mrs. Boyle&mdash;'</p>

<p>'She won't!' said Andy, sourly.</p>

<p>The two young men had instantly changed roles; Andy was hard
now, and demanding; Zed was all one sun of certainty.</p>

<p>'How do you know she won't? It's true that Mrs. Boyle has
talent and a technique that clicks like a&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Like a safety razor,' from Andy.</p>

<p>'Oh, shut up, boss. But what Beth has, I think, that the Boyle
can never buy, is a feeling for all the human emotions in the
world. I don't know how she does it; I wouldn't call her
sentimental, and yet she has a feeling for everything from a baby
bawling for its rattle&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Babies don't have rattles any more.'</p>

<p>'&mdash;to an old farmer who's going to have the mortgage
foreclosed. She has a real grandeur of emotions&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You haven't seemed to think I had any kind of emotions worth
paying attention to, these last few weeks, Zed,' snapped
Bethel.</p>

<p>'Huh? Me? Why drag that in?... Andy, don't cue her any
more. Mahala says you did all night&mdash;and oh, say, is our
Mahala sore that Beth is our new star. <i>Let her alone
now</i>.'</p>

<p>Andy turned on Zed with, 'I thought you believed in driving
'em! I seem to remember some powerful remarks about no rehearsal
being worth anything unless it lasted all night and the actors
dropped in the wings sobbing.'</p>

<p>'I think I have said something of that sort, but I'll bet the
poor kid's already done her sobbing. Let's take her to the
theatre, and just run through her crosses, and fix up her
costumes, and then I'll take her for a drive, and at four-thirty
there's a recital by the Schnoelberg Chamber Quartet&mdash;a
lovely lot of Brahms&mdash;and that'll rest her.'</p>

<p>Bethel looked brightly and beady eyed from one to the other of
the young men (sitting on the edge of her bed!) fighting over her
welfare. They had both pretty well managed to forget it till
now.</p>

<p>Andy complained, 'No, that'll just tire her out. <i>Let her
alone now</i>!'</p>

<p>It was, rather surprisingly, Zed who was discerning enough to
suggest, 'Of course we might ask Beth what she'd like to do?
Little drive, pet? Some nice, rich, chocolaty Brahms?'</p>

<p>'Yes! That's what I'd like.'</p>

<p>And Andy was generous, as only Andy could be. He broke out
smiling. 'Good! I just wanted&mdash;Now we're really getting some
action on our tour. Beth! Maybe you can go on playing Juliet. I
can drop Mrs. Boyle if I want to, now, on threat of charges filed
with Equity, and if I could just save on her salary, I think we
could afford to keep going. Bless you both, and happy afternoon.
See you at the theatre in an hour about costumes, Beth? I... I
... sort of wish I were going with you two!' He sounded wistful
but he looked content.</p>

<p>'And if you'll get out of here now, Zed&mdash;' said
Bethel.</p>

<p>'Eh? What? Oh, that's so. I suppose you do want to put on some
clothes.'</p>

<p><br>
As she dressed she thought how odd it was that Andy, reared to
a family which probably took an annual subscription to the
Worcester symphony concert series and gave its young a choice
between Piano, French, and Small Boat Sailing, would not have
thought of preparing for a crisis by going to a concert, while to
Zed, brought up on a Montana ranch, music was as daily and as
necessary as bread.</p>

<p><br>
There was a hectic hour at the theatre while Mrs. Golly, the
wardrobe mistress, made safety-pin alterations in Mrs. Boyle's
costumes. The star was not much taller, but vastly more expansive
at the waist, and Mrs. Golly kept admonishing Bethel, 'Listen,
dearie, I guess this will hold, but in your emotional scenes
don't emote too much or the Citizens of Verona are going to see
your maidenly dresses turning into Mother Hubbards right before
their eyes. My! I'll never forget one time when I was playing
bits with David Warfield, and...'</p>

<p><br>
Zed took her to a slow and expensive and beautiful lunch at
the Muehlebach. The talk was good. It dealt entirely with the
theatre.</p>

<p>In a taxi they drove out to the cliffs above the plain of the
Missouri River, looking on a valley whose wide snowfields not
long ago had known the Caw Indians and bearded men with rifles.
Shivering there, while in his seat the driver of the taxi
shivered also and looked annoyed, Zed was moved to remember his
own West: the first show he had ever seen, which was Old Dr.
Kippipoose's Navaho Elixir International and Oriental Al Fresco
Entertainments, with the Old Indian Doctor, who had a charming
sing-song Swedish accent, making a violent ventriloquist
melodrama with three puppets. And so, at sixteen, Zed had run
away from home and a widowed father of no particular sobriety and
had joined another Indian Doctor and himself become a
ventriloquist.</p>

<p>'No! You're <i>not!'</i> thrilled Bethel. 'You can't do
ventriloquism!'</p>

<p>Seemingly it was the taxi driver who answered her: 'Certainly
he can. And in this state Zed gallops night by night through
Bethel's brains, and then she dreams of love.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you're wonderful! Anybody can be a perfect Mercutio, but
to do ventriloquism&mdash;'</p>

<p>And she hugged him impulsively, and, arms about each other, in
great good spirits, the two children of the stage went back to
the taxi, and on to the melancholy sweetness of Johannes
Brahms.</p>

<p>He held her hand through the concert&mdash;not too tightly,
just comfortingly.</p>

<p>Zed was the excellent concert companion. He neither chattered,
nor yet frowned if she moved in her seat. And whenever she fell
down from the heights of the music into worrying, and was seized
with the fear and nausea of First Night Sickness, he seemed to
know it and pressed her hand, and she felt part of his angry
strength. And when, at the close, he said, 'Darn swell
concert&mdash;that 'cellist is one grand fiddler', she understood
that he had expressed it all with poetry and elegance.</p>

<p>Dinner was tea and toast, and it lasted four or five
years.</p>

<p>She had, for this week, a dressing-room of her own. No one
dared suggest that she take that of the star&mdash;who was now
reported to be smiling in her sleep&mdash;but for her changes she
did have Mrs. Boyle's maid, Hilda. She would gladly have lost
Hilda and Hilda's stare. Now Bethel knew what a basilisk looked
like. Trembling, she tried to make her eyes particularly large
and yielding. She didn't feel yielding at all. She felt sick.</p>

<p>When she was in her first costume, Juliet's tight youthful
house dress, Andy came in, looking weary.</p>

<p>'Darling, did you have a good afternoon with Zed?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes. He was sweet. I think he kept me from committing
suicide. Andy! He can do ventriloquism!'</p>

<p>'He wasn't rude? Didn't bawl you out?'</p>

<p>'Of course not! He knew what I've got ahead of me.'</p>

<p>'Yes. I'll hand it to Zed, he has a real devotion to the
stage. We all love you, and we're all rooting for your success.
And you're going to put it over to-night, and you'll be our
permanent Juliet, maybe, and with good old Zed and me and you
working together, this whole tour is going to take on a new life
and go over with a slam.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure of it!'</p>

<p><br>
Before the curtain, Andy announced that Mrs. Boyle was
suddenly 'indisposed with the flu, and though we have every hope
and expectation that to-morrow evening she will again be with us,
to-night I have a pleasant surprise for you, and the part of
Juliet will be played by one of the most brilliant and lovely of
the young modern actresses, Miss Bethel Merriday'. He said
nothing about the audience getting their money back, and only
five people did go out to get it, which was just as well,
considering that the audience was merely a fan-shaped darkening
of the middle of the theatre.</p>

<p>Nathan Eldred took Bethel's place and spoke the prologue,
wearing&mdash;after hasty consultation about it with
Andy&mdash;the morning coat and striped trousers which he had in
reserve as understudy for Capulet. Later, nobody could quite
remember just why he had worn this banker's uniform for a
prologue.</p>

<p>He did fairly well, though he had never rehearsed the speech.
He left out the line 'From ancient grudge break to new mutiny',
but apparently no one noticed. Certainly there was no sound of
new mutiny breaking, out there in the awesome dark majesty of the
audience.</p>

<p>Through the prologue, Bethel stood in the wings and listened
and suffered. She was too frightened to go back to her dressing-
room and relax.</p>

<p>She did not come on till fourteen minutes after the rise of
the curtain. During those fourteen centuries she tried to listen
to Andy, Zed, Challis, Charlotte and several thousand others
telling her that she was an admirable Juliet. She heard nothing
but her own misery and, having quietly determined that she
couldn't remember one line of the play, she saw that the
catastrophe was complete and there was no use in worrying about
it, and she sat stooped and steeped in misery, till Eldred's
signal, and her cue, Mahala's voice cheerily calling, 'Where's
this girl? What, Juliet!'</p>

<p>She ran on, her voice saying, 'How now! Who calls?' as gaily
and sweetly and naturally as though she had been doing this for a
thousand nights.</p>

<p>She even had presence enough to be able to look at Mahala, in
Lady Capulet's velvet house dress, and to react to the Nurse's
fond smile. She had dived. She was swimming. She was playing. She
was Juliet!</p>

<p><br>
She had her first agony in the first long colloquy between her
and Romeo.</p>

<p>She started off confidently enough and winningly enough on her
first tremendous speech:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

'Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,<br>

Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek.'</p>

<br>

<p>Yes, she had said that much, or that much had mechanically got
itself said, when she stopped with an incredible jolt. She hadn't
an idea how the speech went on. Utter blank. She could see the
long lines there before her, like a black wall, but she could not
climb them.</p>

<p>She had, by stage usage, 'blown'; she had 'blown higher than a
kite'.</p>

<p>And the blessed Andy was 'throwing her the line'&mdash;giving
her her own words, with variations; speaking as cheerfully as
though all was well:</p>

<br>


<p class="verse">

'Thou meanst for that which thou has spoke to-night?'</p>

<br>

<p>Glory! She almost had it again!</p>

<p>He was going on:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

'Fain would'st thou dwell on form, fain, fain deny<br>

What thou hast spoke?'</p>

<br>

<p>She had it! She snatched the speech from him, and capped his
interpolation triumphantly with:</p>

<br>


<p class="verse">

'Aye! Farewell compliment!<br>


Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say "Aye"!'</p>

<br>


<p>And then she was singing on, flawless, to the end of the
speech.</p>

<p>Only afterwards did she think that Eldred, holding the script
in the wings, must have prompted her and she, in her agitation,
not have heard him.</p>

<p><br>
She marched on well enough until the Nurse gave her Romeo's
summons to the friar's cell for marriage. Then suddenly she had
left in her no blood, no voice. She was not Juliet revealing love
and fear; she was a Miss Bethel Merriday reciting lines. When she
addressed the Nurse, 'O Lord, why look'st thou sad?' it sounded
as though she were speaking to a stranger named Mr. Lord. At the
end of the scene, when she made exit, to fly to Laurence's cell
with a joyous 'Hie to high fortune!' there was not a ripple from
the audience&mdash;and here the valiant Juliet of Mrs. Boyle had
invariably floated out on applause.</p>

<p>Before the intermission&mdash;they were playing <i>Romeo</i>
in two acts&mdash;she had only one more scene, and then, six
minutes before the act-end, she fled to her dressing-room and
while Hilda Donnersberg, gaunt and high, looked down at her with
Mid-European scorn, she wept on her arm on the dressing-
table.</p>

<p>She was finished for ever as an actress.</p>

<p><br>
'In Austria, where there is a really <i>great</i> theatre, a
real German theatre, we would never allow a young girl like you
to play Juliet, but always a woman with some sense and art, like
Frau Boyle.'</p>

<p>'But Juliet's only fourteen in the play.'</p>

<p>'Oh no. That's yoost a mistake in the English translation of
Shakesbur,' said Hilda.</p>

<p>'And I ought to be at the hotel with poor Mrs. Boyle. She is
sick of the stomach,' said Hilda.</p>

<p>In all that fifteen-minute intermission, the only persons who
came into her dressing-room were Andy and Zed and Tertius
Tully.</p>

<p>Tertius said, 'Good girl! We're all rooting for you. Well, got
to hustle out and count the cash.'</p>

<p>Andy said, 'Good girl! We all think you're swell. Well, I got
to hustle in and change.'</p>

<p>Zed, who was Mercutio, and was therefore now dead except for
the resurrection of the curtain call, said, 'Good girl. You've
got through the worst of it. Good luck!'</p>

<p><br>
She never remembered anything of the second act. She tried to
practise the stage art of listening, but she heard nothing the
other actors said to her. She was busy running over what her
answering speech would be.</p>

<p>While preparing to drink the sleeping potion, she
soliloquized:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

'I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,<br>

That almost freezes up the heat of life,'</p>

<br>


<p class="first">her inner thoughts were somewhat less lyric:</p>

<p>'Got to remember, lay down the dagger with the cue "Lie thou
there". Yes, this speech ends the scene; thank heaven I don't
have to give anybody a cue... That woman coughing in the front
row again. Why doesn't she take a lozenge?... Oh, dear, why
did I jump Mahala's cue?... Did I leave the cover off my
powder? I'm almost sure I did; I can see it lying there with the
cover off... She coughs all the time... To have a chance
like this and not be able to <i>do</i> it! I can just hear how
Katharine Cornell would be playing this; her voice so warm and
sure; I just squawk and move like a stick... Hey! Careful!
Don't hurry that line so much!... If I ever play this
again&mdash;fat chance!&mdash;I'd like to try giving most of this
speech with my back to the audience&mdash;dressing-table or
something, and they see me in the mirror?... Now there's
another cougher, centre.'</p>

<p>The speech was going on:</p>

<br>


<p class="verse">

'There's a fearful point,<br>

Shall I not then be stifled in the vault?'</p>

<br>

<p class="first">and her small girl's thoughts racing with
it:</p>

<p>'If I only had the training. I swear, maybe I could do it...
 Oh, I do think I'm getting some of the horror into it now...
Curious, I can say the lines, and really feel them&mdash;oh, but
<i>really&mdash;</i>and still have other thoughts...
Project&mdash;project&mdash;look up at the balcony&mdash;oh dear,
that spot simply blinds me.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

'Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,<br>

Lies fest'ring in his shroud.</p>

<br>

<p>'I am <i>so</i> tired; I feel dizzy; I hope I'm not going to
faint. That would be dreadful. Shall I fall on the bed now? No, I
guess I can get through. I've <i>got</i> to... That woman
coughing...'</p>

<p><br>
She existed to the end of the play.</p>

<p>All through the final scene her voice seemed to her more
quavery and more colourless with every word, and at last,
incredulously, she had the relief of stabbing herself and lying
motionless and silent.</p>

<p>When they took the curtain calls, when Andy pushed her on for
the star's call by herself, there was no spontaneous general
applause but only a scattering of hard mature hands, as of grown
men who had daughters like her and who were sorry for her.</p>

<p>Angrily, head up and proud, she made her way to her dressing-
room.</p>

<p>Her only remark to herself was, 'Well, I flopped!'</p>

<p>Six or seven of the company did come in to see her. None of
them said anything but a noncommittal 'Fine, you got through it
all right' that was worse than damning. Only Tudor Blackwall, who
had a gift for it, was able to gush: 'You were a perfect duck! I
think it's wonderful that you could have got clear through when
you've only been having understudy rehearsals, and not really
playing in the set. I thought you were so young and
sweet&mdash;the <i>real</i> Juliet!'</p>

<p>Not till after she was dressed for the street, in a
Sladesburian mustard-coloured suit now growing shabby, did her
real masters come in&mdash;Zed and Andy.</p>

<p><br>
They looked as if each resented the other's intrusion, and
then in chorus they made just the same vapid, hearty sound of
'<i>Well</i>!'</p>

<p>Andy opened up:</p>

<p>'You did really fine. I think it's remarkable, your being able
to get through at all, with so little time for rehearsal. You
didn't let us down one bit. Just&mdash;uh&mdash;swell. I haven't
one word of criticism. You've carried us through the most
dangerous spot of the tour. I'm sure Mrs. Boyle will be able to
carry on to-morrow night. I've got a doctor working on
her&mdash;I've just been talking to him on the phone. And you
did&mdash;uh&mdash;swell!'</p>

<p>He kissed her forehead&mdash;with all the passion of a box-
office treasurer. And, she noted, he said nothing more about her
going on playing Juliet, about dropping Mrs. Boyle.</p>

<p>Well, why should he! Dear Andy! If he hadn't been the kindest
person living, he would be flaying her for ruining the Great
Chance.</p>

<p>Zed was talking:</p>

<p>'No, you weren't so "swell". You were pretty wooden. In fact,
terrible. It's curious: talking to you, I feel as if you were at
least as mature as Mrs. Boyle. You have fundamental wisdom. You
know how things should be acted. Yet you have no application of
your knowledge yet. It's training that you need, of course. I'd
like to stick you in stock and make you play fifty roles in fifty
weeks. Just now and then to-night, you really were that naive,
lovely Italian kid, in love with real flesh and blood, and
<i>then</i> you had something that no old war horse like Boyle
could ever get. Boyle and her damn dog! But mostly you sounded
like the radio. Too bad.'</p>

<p>Bethel was reflecting, 'Andy says I was good, and didn't like
me. Zed says I was terrible, and liked me a lot.'</p>

<p>Andy boomed, 'Look, darling, I've got to hustle upstairs to
the office and check some bills with Tertius. Got to be paid to-
morrow. But can you wait half an hour&mdash;not more'n an hour,
anyway? I'd like to buy you some food. Of course I'd be delighted
to have you come, too, Zed.'</p>

<p>'Hang it, I can't. I promised Doug Fry, two days ago, to go
out to the house of a Kansas City University prof and look over
some plans with them for a <i>Coriolanus</i> production. Well,
good luck, pet. See you to-morrow, Andy.'</p>

<p>She sighed, 'Oh, I don't think I'll wait, Andy. I want to get
right to bed.'</p>

<p>On the first night of her playing Juliet, Bethel Merriday
walked to the hotel by herself, a small figure alone at night in
the empty business streets of a strange city.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>

<p class="first">'I'M more sensitive than you give me credit for.
I've noticed how you cock an eye at me every time you catch me
long-distance telephoning. Well now, I can't do much more phoning
even if I wanted to. I'm too busted,' said Andy to Beth, in the
presence of his palace guard: Mahala, Zed, Hugh Challis, Doc
Keezer and Tertius Tully.</p>

<p>'But at the same time, I've just really started my campaign to
get more backing. I'm going after every poor unfortunate that I
know or that my dear mother knows. Beth, you can type, can't
you?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Want to be my stenographer&mdash;unpaid&mdash;along with your
acting?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sure.'</p>

<p>'I can't afford even hotel stenographers any more&mdash;and I
don't want them to know too much about our difficulties, and
maybe let them out to the press. So we'll start in.'</p>

<p>Mahala had an icy explosion.</p>

<p>'My dear Andy, if you want to play around with Miss Merriday
all the time&mdash;'</p>

<p>'With <i>who?'</i></p>

<p>'Miss Merriday!&mdash;and if you can't endure being separated
from her, why don't you say so? Why all this pretence about her
being a secretary? I'm sure I don't care.'</p>

<p>Andy let her have it. 'Maggie, your sudden anaesthesia to my
charms couldn't have anything to do with the fact that now I'm
just another poor young man, could it?'</p>

<p>'Oh, you are vile! I knew you were phony&mdash;Andrew Deacon,
the great Yale amateur!&mdash;but I didn't think you could so
misjudge one who's been your best and truest friend!'</p>

<p>Mahala swept out of the room, at her most sweeping.</p>

<p>All this was at mid-afternoon, in Sedalia, Missouri, on
Thursday, January 5th, 1939.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boyle had re-arisen from her abyss of Scotch and cognac
on Wednesday, the third and last day in Kansas City, and had
played Juliet more wistfully, more movingly than ever before.
Watching the two parts of her, the sick and trembling woman and
the serene actress, move deftly on together, Bethel the
Understudy again savoured her own failure.</p>

<p>But Andy expected the spree to be repeated. And he had thus
called, in Sedalia, the meeting of his inner ring.</p>

<p>He went on, after Mahala had done her aristocratic out-
sweeping:</p>

<p>'The next thing is: I've got to ask for a fifty per cent cut
in all salaries over eighty dollars. I know that's like the
verdict of guilty and you just wait for sentence to be pronounced
and the tour ended, but I honestly believe that if the cast will
vote and take this cut, we can pull through. If they won't take
it, I'm finished. I'll have to put up our closing notice on next
Monday. So, Doc, as Equity deputy, I want you to call a meeting
of the cast after the show this evening.'</p>

<p>Doc hemmed, 'All right, Andy. But you know this cut will break
your run-of-the-play contract with Mrs. Boyle, if she wants to
take advantage of it, and she can give you her two weeks'
notice.'</p>

<p>'I know, and I don't care.'</p>

<p><br>
It is not festive for the cast of a touring company to meet
and vote on the choice between taking cut salaries and seeing the
closing notice put up on the call board. That notice, put up on
Monday, will, unless it be taken down by Thursday night, end the
tour the following Saturday night.</p>

<p>Andy, though he was actor and Equity member, was, as producer,
not permitted to attend. And Mahala murmured that Bethel ought
not to be&mdash;she was only a miserable junior member of Equity
and, as Andy's new and slightly irregular secretary, was
completely suspect.</p>

<p>Bethel glared at her and attended the meeting, in the littered
storage room beneath the stage where the musicians played
pinochle. They perched on a workbench, on broken chairs, on paint
buckets. A few minutes ago, they had been the gentry of Verona,
noble in their woes, above such sordidness as jobs and meal
tickets; now they were an anxious group of workers, with street
clothes not quite so fresh as when they had left New York six
weeks ago.</p>

<p>Doc Keezer made a speech voluminous and abstruse:</p>

<p>'Well, boys and girls, I guess you all know why we've got
together. Andy is asking for a fifty per cent cut above eighty.
He's a straight guy, and he wouldn't ask for it if he could help
it. Personally, I think that with the cut, the show has a chance.
All in favour sig'fy raisn' ri' hand.'</p>

<p>Oh no, none of that for Mrs. Boyle, with the Scotch still in
her, and a pretty good grievance.</p>

<p>She said that she was a very fine actress, and that she had
come on this tour for a miserable thousand dollars a week merely
to bring culture and...</p>

<p>She would not vote against the cut; but if it came, she would
give notice; and after two weeks more of such inexpressible
tortures as having to sleep in hotels and travel on trains, she
would return to decency.</p>

<p>Doc looked at her as he would look at a handsome specimen of
the three-toed sloth, and remarked, 'A'favour sig'fy
rice'and.'</p>

<p>The cut was accepted, and they all looked relieved.</p>

<p><br>
That night, from midnight till two in the morning, when their
train would leave, Bethel and Andy sat in a cold 'parlour' on the
hotel mezzanine getting out letters to be sent off by air mail;
letters to friends of Andy's family&mdash;Boston cotton brokers,
Harvard overseers, Worcester bankers; to classmates of his own
and to their parents&mdash;New York stockbrokers, Yale trustees,
Pittsburgh bankers. The letters all said the same thing: he
honestly believed that the troubles were over; he wanted them to
invest not less than one hundred and not more than a thousand
dollars in the show; he could give them no guarantees
whatever.</p>

<p>He dictated to her, on the machine. Her typing was rusty, but
as she began to regain speed, it had the exhilaration of
swimming. He worked unnervously, gently, but he was
disconcertingly swift. Once he smoothed her hair. Mostly he
seemed not to know that she was anything but part of her
typewriter. But never, not even in acting, had she had more joy
than out of this working, as a partner, mature, respected, with a
man she liked.</p>

<p>As they drove to the train, she inquired, 'But what are we
going to do for a Juliet, with Mrs. Boyle gone?'</p>

<p>'I'm going to give it to Mahala, if that elegant young woman
shows proper appreciation.'</p>

<p>'And who's going to take Mahala's place as Lady Capulet?'</p>

<p>'You are.'</p>

<p>'Me?'</p>

<p>'You!'</p>

<p>'After&mdash;oh, Andy, after my flop night before last?'</p>

<p>'As a matter of fact, I've talked this over with Zed, and it
was he who suggested you. I'm fond enough of you so I don't like
the queer fascination that young desperado apparently has for
you, but I guess I'm too dumb to lie, and truth is, Zed thinks
much more of your performance Tuesday night than I did. It's his
theory that you stumbled so just because you did have a big
conception of the part&mdash;weren't content to play it prettily,
but wanted to put more into it than the training you've had would
carry. Anyway, you're to play Lady Capulet, and we'll work out
your make-up, with the help of Mabel, and Zed and I both think
you'll make a small-size Lady Capulet, very cute. Kitten, I think
you may have quite an interesting life for the next two weeks.
You'll have to learn and rehearse the new part in that time,
<i>and</i> play your present parts as usual (we'll put Vera Cross
on the prologue, when you switch), <i>and</i> be my secretary two
or three hours a day, <i>and</i> travel, <i>and</i> merely give
up all sleep and eating. Can you stand it?'</p>

<p>'I'll love it,' she said drowsily.</p>

<p>She was too drowsy even to enjoy fully the comedy on the
Pullman, when Andy told Mahala that she could have the part of
Juliet if she behaved herself, and she told Andy that she might
consent to play the part of Juliet if he behaved <i>himself,</i>
but instantly gave herself away with an excited, <i>'Say! How
many sides is the Juliet part?'</i></p>

<p><br>
Sedalia and Columbia and Jefferson City and Springfield,
Missouri. Little Rock, Arkansas. Memphis, Tennessee. But Bethel
saw nothing but theatre, hotel rooms, her Lady Capulet part and
her typewriter.</p>

<p>One night in each of these cities, and then in St. Louis for a
three-night and matin&eacute;e run: the Thursday, Friday and
Saturday of the seventh week of the tour.</p>

<p>The learning by Bethel and Mahala of their new parts was
hectic. They were to assume them not in two weeks but in ten
days, in Topeka, Kansas, on the Monday night after the St. Louis
run, in order to keep the week's advertising consistent.</p>

<p>The moment of that nightmare that she best remembered was
playing Prologue and Page and Epilogue with a flu temperature of
99 1/2&deg;, and then being cued, for two hours, by Andy, whose
own temperature was 100 1/4&deg;, and who was succeeded, in a hot
little reception room upstairs in their old hotel in Little Rock,
by Zed, who disdainfully declined to have anything so popular as
the flu. All three of them were in rather disgraceful sweaters
and overcoats over pyjamas, and the cuing threatened to end for
ever when Andy was so foolish as to speculate to Zed:</p>

<p>'Do you know there's one way, perfectly legitimate, that we
could put this show over? I'm a better comedian than a romantic,
and Doc and Mabel are pretty good. Why not punch the comedy lines
a lot harder, even if we do sacrifice some of the poetry?'</p>

<p>Zed yelled:</p>

<p>'Every once in a while I realize that I was a traitor in going
against my better judgment and throwing in with you and helping
you put this show over&mdash;me actually starting in next Monday
trying to coax Kansas school kids to please come see the
monkeys&mdash;instead of letting it die painlessly. "Merely
sacrifice the poetry"!'</p>

<p>'But I thought you didn't care so much for that.'</p>

<p>'Andy, I don't suppose you ever can understand even the
simplest principles of the modern drama. I want to emphasize the
poetry a lot <i>more</i> than you do, but the real poetry, with
biology and individuality in it, and <i>use</i> the fine, juicy
words, not be used by them, not drool them out, long and
lingering, like a poetic congressman quoting Tennyson!'</p>

<p>'I see,' said Andy, placid. 'Well, keep up the cuing as long
as you can stand it.'</p>

<p>With Andy gone, Zed was still unpleasant. Bethel didn't like
him very much. But he didn't seem to care what she thought, for
in face of an Icy Stare&mdash;Bethel was sure that not Mrs. Boyle
herself could have done you a better Icy Stare&mdash;he went on
raging:</p>

<p>'I don't know why I take the trouble to cue you. Mahala was
right: you're still Teacher's Pet, and what's worse, you sat
there and listened to that half-back proposing to hoke
Shakespeare, and never raised an eyebrow.'</p>

<p>'Of course I did, you baby. I don't always show what I
think.'</p>

<p>'Don't you, pet? Do you ever think? Come on now&mdash;see if
you can make Her Ladyship sound like anything besides Sladesbury,
if that's its name. Oh, why do we go on with all this farce? Just
to enable me to address Sunday school maidens in Alhambra,
Kansas? Come on&mdash;come on. Start with:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

'Oh, daughter, are you up?'</p>

<br>

<p>St. Louis, in the three days there, was kind to them, and they
were kind to St. Louis. It was Mrs. Boyle's last days with the
company, and she was enough of a trouper, despite a weakness for
vicarages and cold toast which years of Old Fashioned cocktails
and America had only partly corrected, to play at her burning
top; and Andy desperate enough to throw himself into Romeo with
none of the proprieties of the gentleman amateur. And the critics
were benevolent. Writing in the <i>Star-Mail,</i> Ben Talerick
said:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">To confess a boredom with the average production
of Shakespeare is as dangerous as to admit a dislike for dogs,
and this column declines to state his general position. But he
will say that in Mr. Deacon's grand, boyish manner of playing
Romeo, and Mrs. Boyle's literally thrilling revelation of
youthful beauty in Juliet, he found the most cheering show of
this whole current season. By all means go and see it, and learn
how the theatre can be experimental without being freakish.</p>

<br>


<p>And they did go and see it, in considerable numbers... not
quite enough, Andy sighed to Bethel at her stenographic labours,
to pay the back debts of the company and still have an adequate
reserve for starting off across Kansas next week. But the company
was cheered up enough so that Andy received only one two weeks'
notice&mdash;from Jeff Hoy.</p>

<p>Zed had, presumably, been struggling in prayer with Mr. Hoy,
for he was almost human as he gave notice. He even went so far as
to hope that the tour would go on even when, he being gone, there
would be nobody left in the company.</p>

<p>And as producer, Andy gave only one two weeks' notice&mdash;to
Iris.</p>

<p>'You can't do that!' Bethel wailed, when Andy told her his
intention. 'The poor kid! She's just the proud kind that thinks
she never could be fired, and'll be all the more broken by
it.'</p>

<p>'She's the only one that's dispensable, and you know I've got
to save every penny, or go under. It's a choice between her and
Vera Cross, and Vera doesn't mind touring, while with Iris it's
just too painful for a humanitarian to have to watch her.'</p>

<p>This time Andy did not ask Bethel to do his slaughtering. When
she saw Iris on Saturday evening, saw the soreness of tears in
the corners of her eyes, Bethel herself wanted to cry, and swore
a great vow that she could never again hate any woman... not
even Mahala... much. And she saw Iris draw Doug Fry into the
prop room, argue with him, plead with him.</p>

<p>All of Iris's spun-glass superiority was gone then; she was
merely a frightened, anaemic girl. Douglas was casually listening
to her, indifferently patting her shoulder in comfort. Bethel
guessed that Iris was begging him to give his notice so that they
might depart together.</p>

<p>But when the company started off for Kansas, Sunday morning,
Douglas still had not quit, and all day long, across the snow-
blind plain, he sat cheerfully reading Adolphe Appia on scenery,
beside a silent Iris, suddenly ten years older and hungry.</p>

<p>As all women do think, now and then, Bethel thought, 'I hate
all men!'</p>

<p><br>
Andy was almost cured of extravagance. He gave no parties in
St. Louis except that, in exaltation at the good reviews, he did
invite all the cast in for drinks after the show on Friday
evening.</p>

<p>He had no suite of his own now to house them; for the party,
he borrowed one, with a noble kitchenette with electric stove and
icebox.</p>

<p>In gaiety, it was a children's party; they played The Game,
and Harry Purvis imitated Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Wallace Ford.
But it was not childish in the gallantry with which the company
put aside the fact that, two weeks from tomorrow evening, they
would either be safe for months, or be working people without
jobs in midwinter.</p>

<p>Andy was gayest of all.</p>

<p>Bethel and he were the bartenders. They were in the
kitchenette, mixing Cuba Libres, and he had just tweaked her ear,
with no particular frenzy, when they were aware of Mahala in the
doorway.</p>

<p>She stared at them, long, silently, enjoying her own nobility.
Her line, thrown at them as she turned away, was, 'So! I thought
so! You two are sweethearts!'</p>

<p>But Andy laughed, after Mahala's exit.</p>

<p>'Poor kitten! That settles you. I think her idea is a pretty
good one, at that. But anyway, I guess you're stuck with me now.
My mother has disowned me, and Joan Hinterwald has broken our
engagement about seven times now&mdash;she alternates letters,
telegrams and telephone calls&mdash;and the company, they're
casting dice for which gets first stab at Old Man Caesar. So
you're about all I've got, my darling!'</p>

<p>He sat, looking charmingly absurd on a small folding
stepladder in the kitchenette, to talk:</p>

<p>'This isn't apropos of anything, but I have a picture that
comes to me whenever I feel lonely and put-upon. Prob'ly I got it
out of some movie accompanied by tin-pan-alley music. It's of
flying across the continent, very eager to get back to my girl
and to my home, which is on an island, I think, or maybe it's a
peninsula. It's not an extravagant place, but there's a big
living-room lined with redwood, and from the porch you see the
Pacific beyond the pines. And my girl's standing out there when I
come home, after hustling from the aeroplane... Oh, well, come
on; let's take in the drinks.'</p>

<p><br>
On Saturday, after the evening performance, Mrs. Lumley Boyle
said farewell, or in a distinguished manner declined to say
farewell, before catching the midnight train for New York.</p>

<p>When they had arrived to make up, she had rather lingered in
the dressing-room alley, with little cries of 'Well, I'll have
breakfast in New York Monday morning!' Nobody said anything more
than 'That's so'. Even Lyle Johnson and Tony Murphy looked bored.
'Well, good luck,' they droned.</p>

<p>She caught their indifference. She slammed her dressing-room
door. And after the show, as Bethel waited for Andy, she saw a
procession: Mrs. Boyle, looking old and tired, a little shabby in
a three-year-old suit, carrying her jewel case and the dog Pluto;
Hilda Donnersberg carrying a suitcase and the make-up box. They
marched to the stage door. The doorman looked up benevolently,
with a look that spelled two dollars, and maybe five. Mrs. Boyle
halted, shrugged, dropped a fifty-cent piece into his hand and
marched out, unspeaking.</p>

<p>But after her galloped Mabel Staghorn, carrying her kitten,
Pippy, in its cage.</p>

<p>She came back weeping.</p>

<p>'What <i>is</i> it, Mabe?' said Doc.</p>

<p>Mabel wailed, 'I thought poor Pluto would be so lonely without
his little friend, so I offered Pippy to Mrs. Boyle and&mdash;the
sun of a gun, she <i>took</i> her!'</p>

<p>That was the star's farewell.</p>

<p><br>
Their long Sunday daytime ride in a day coach across Missouri,
from St. Louis to Topeka, Kansas, was a grey ride, and a
depressed ride. Even the bridge players were quiet.</p>

<p>When Bethel looked out of the train window, the farm-houses,
which had come to seem sturdy to her, seemed to crouch amid the
snow-waste.</p>

<p>All day Andy alternated cuing her with dictating letters. She
was tired. This didn't seem like great acting, like the creation
of fabulous queens. Zed stopped by them derisively. 'The Deacon
Theatrical Enterprises doing a big business?'</p>

<p>Andy muttered, afterward, 'Sometimes I could almost dislike
that brash young man.'</p>

<p>'Why only sometimes?'</p>

<p>'I agree.'</p>

<p>'Cheer up, Andy. To-morrow night you'll have a wondrous new
Juliet and a pretty good new Lady Capulet.'</p>

<p>'Yes. Actually, the show will be better knit, a better unit,
without that blasted star. And so it's a pity&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What? What?'</p>

<p>'I've got to put up the closing notice to-morrow night.'</p>

<p>'Got to?'</p>

<p>'Yes. We made money in St. Louis, but not enough. And I've
received only eleven hundred dollars from all our begging
letters. But don't worry. And don't tell anybody else. Let them
be happy till to-morrow night.'</p>

<p>'We'll be closing next Saturday night? It will all be
over?'</p>

<p>'No. Not necessarily. With this new streamlined set-up, we've
got the best chance in the world to put it over. I feel
thoroughly optimistic.' He didn't sound so. 'I'm sure as anything
that I'll be able to take down the closing notice next Thursday
evening and that we'll be able to go on for months
yet&mdash;weeks, anyway.'</p>

<p>She heard none of that; she knew only that to-morrow night,
the very night when she would first play a major role of her very
own on the professional stage, the closing notice would be put
up.</p>

<p>That wasn't at all good enough.</p>

<p>Yes, it had to be! she scolded herself. She would have one
week's chance, at least. And she mustn't load any more woes on
Andy's now unsteady shoulders.</p>

<p>She patted his hand, she chirped, 'I'm sure everything will go
fine. I'm going back and get you some coffee.'</p>

<p>'Good,' said Andy.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>

<p class="first">THIS time, in Topeka, she had been too busy all
day to let her imagination work up the sick suspense that had
broken her down as Juliet, back in Kansas City. She had just time
to make up and take her place; she went on and played Lady
Capulet with only a shaky qualm or two, a quiver or two as lines
came slowly to her. But they came.</p>

<p>She was a clove-sweet, slim little old lady, unexpectedly
comic, a husband-ridden aristocrat who was afraid of the babbling
old nurse who dominated the house, and awed, just a bit, by the
splendour of her daughter.</p>

<p>Mahala was too weighty and too stately for Juliet, but she was
not offensive. There was dignity in her role, and some skill.
Never had the company been more heartily applauded than at the
curtain calls, and Andy shouted, 'The miracle's happened! The
closing notice will come down on Thursday, and the tour will go
over!'</p>

<p><br>
To Mahala, this probably meant no more than the fact that she
was now nightly queen of Dressing Room 1&mdash;the star's
dressing-room. It is doubtful if it ever occurred to her that any
other star would ever have the impudence to come along and occupy
it later. If she had been so profoundly imaginative as to think
about it at all, she would have seen those few cubic feet of air
known sacredly forever after, through all history, as 'Miss
Mahala Vale's Dressing-room'. She really was wrong, though. Four
days later a celebrated lady strip-teaser who had never heard of
Mahala was treating the room as exclusively hers.</p>

<p>Monday morning, slightly sweating in the zero cold as they
drove up to the great high-school building, stage-frightened as
he had never been on the stage, Zed addressed a high school at
assembly hour.</p>

<p>Bethel sat in the very back of the auditorium and adored him,
and watched the teachers, in the row of seats beside her, being
astonished by him. That strong face, not ironed out by spiritual
massage like most Americans to-day, that face of a strong
workman, became the glowing face of a poet, the profound face of
a scholar, as he told them, with simple confession, that to him
the theatre was both scrupulous priesthood and eager
adventure.</p>

<p>And after the performance, Monday night, before they went to
the Pullman which they had engaged for the whole week, it was Zed
who gave them a party. A rather simple party: beer and tomato-
and-bacon sandwiches, at Mike's Le Bon Louvre Lunchroom, but
friendly.</p>

<p>Tony Murphy, the Trotsky of the party, arose with a toast:</p>

<p>'Andy, if we get many audiences as good as to-night, the tour
will go on. And if it does, I want to get in under the line, and
not have you think I'm turning decent just because I'm sure of
the cakes. I'm afraid I've done a little crabbing. I swear I
didn't mean to. I guess it's just a bad habit I've got. And now
that the Boyle&mdash;of whom I may say that I fell for her like a
ton of brick&mdash;has gone, and we're all a roughneck bunch of
American troupers&mdash;including you, Hugh, who have practically
lived down London and have gotten converted to liking ice
water&mdash;I think we'll do something. But of course the big
idea of this toast is that all of us now get up and tell Mahala
and Bethel they did a perfectly magnificent job to-night, and
they got a lot of swell poetry and a grand quick tempo into their
performances, and we're proud of them as hell. Skoal!'</p>

<p>And so they were all very happy, even if Bethel did hear
Mahala croak to Jeff Hoy, as they settled down on the train,
'Andy cheerful? He ought to be! He's saving a thousand bucks a
week on the Boyle's salary, and if maybe I'm not as good as she
is, I haven't played it for a quarter of a century!'</p>

<p>The tour had begun to drain Bethel's secure youthfulness, and,
for almost the first time in her life, she could not sleep. She
lay in her rocking berth, listening to the car wheels till the
strain rose to an intolerable wakefulness. She tried to read
herself to sleep, but she read herself awake. She turned off the
bed-head light in this tiny, low-ceiled rolling home of hers,
raised the curtain and watched the specks of light streak by.</p>

<p>Who were they out there, awake in isolated farmhouses so late,
cold wind in cottonwood groves and the cold timbers crackling?... She saw herself as the young farmwife, with her first baby
coming, lying in a spool bed&mdash;what memory was
that?&mdash;with the doctor watching. But he was not the doctor
of the chromos, whiskered and weighty; he was young and fiery, as
rough and scolding as Zed.</p>

<p>But the young husband who stood back in the shadows had the
solicitous kindness of Andy Deacon.</p>

<p>And Bethel was asleep, while the lone lights hurried by.</p>

<p><br>
She had been alive and competent as Lady Capulet; no
amateurishness and no languishing. She had merited the good hand
at the curtain call. But she never would know that the
'spontaneous applause' on her first exit had been about as
spontaneous as a department-store Santa Claus.</p>

<p>Doc Keezer, as he had done a hundred times on half a hundred
tours, had been kneeling way down left, just behind the
tormentor, and at her exit had given one mighty smack of his
hands. That had started the clapping of the innocent audience for
the innocent Bethel, and everybody had been very happy about it,
including Doc.</p>

<p><br>
The Andy who vowed to Bethel that he had become so economical
that he was washing his own socks in his hotel bathroom had had
the Topeka morning-paper review telegraphed ahead, and it greeted
them at their hotel in Wichita:</p>

<br>


<p class="quote">One of the most significant theatrical events
with which Topeka has been favoured in years, equal to seeing Our
Helen in <i>Victoria Regina,</i> was the performance last evening
of the 'Romeo and Juliet in Modern Dress' company, starring
Andrew Deacon and Mahala Vale. Their performance, brought up to
date, made the famous old love story seem as real as the boy and
girl next door. We understand that Miss Vale, who turned out a
first-rate performance full of beauty and wearing clothes that
made the hearts of all feminine auditors go pit-a-pat, and Miss
Bethel Merriday, who turned Mrs. Capulet from the ordinary
stuffed shirt of hackneyed theatrical tradition into a darling,
fussy old lady, are new to their roles. We wish them every
success, and predict for them a great future. Who can be
pessimistic about the Theatre of To-morrow when he sees lovely
young ladies like these give such skill and devotion?</p>

<br>

<p>'Swell! This tour's just begun!' said Andy.</p>

<p>'Maybe it was my being scared and not my skill at playing
fussiness,' said Bethel.</p>

<p>'What a lousy review! My first chance at Juliet, and all that
reporter could find to talk about was my <i>clothes&mdash;</i>and
they just some rags we picked up in St. Louis,' said Mahala.</p>

<p><br>
Andy had another rich cousin in Wichita&mdash;Andy had other
rich cousins almost everywhere, but the Wichita example was a
particularly luscious widow, with a Renaissance house containing
the interior of a beech-panelled room from a dismantled
ch&acirc;teau in Touraine. She invited the cast, entire, for an
after-theatre rout.</p>

<p>Zed descended on Bethel. 'Going to the party?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't know; I haven't anything to wear.'</p>

<p>Zed took a fifty-cent piece out of his left-hand lower vest
pocket and put it in the right.</p>

<p>'Eh?'</p>

<p>'I just bet myself on what you'd say. You know, pet, you're
just the opposite to Iris. You need bringing out. You need to be
pushed into grabbing your own kingdom. You'll probably become a
competent actress, and then a theatrical miser, like Doc or
Mabel; you'll save everything, including your ability, and so
land up in a two-room cottage and spend your declining years
reading your Iowa clippings. You could be beautiful, in a timid
sort of way, but you let yourself look like the housemaid. Come
on, I'm going to take you out now, before I make my high-school
speech, and make you buy a swell party dress. There's a good
department store here.'</p>

<p>'No, no, no!' wailed Bethel. 'I've paid all my debts, and now
I want something to make me secure while I find my next job.'</p>

<p>'I'll buy you one.'</p>

<p>'You will not!'</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>'I don't like you well enough.'</p>

<p>'"A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender, to
answer"&mdash;"I'll not let you be my friend, and blow me to a
single decent dress." Okay. Hell with you!'</p>

<p>Zed slammed on his disreputable hat and walked out of the
hotel lobby, and she could not tell whether his pickle-ish aspect
was from real dislike or a sour approbation of her remarkable
virtue.</p>

<p>So she went in her habitual blue taffeta to the noise and
milling and rum punch at the Rich Cousin's Ch&acirc;teau, but
Zed's jeering had given her what actors call a 'mental
hazard'&mdash;the blind spot in the mind whereby, for some reason
obscure and absurd, you never can remember one certain word in a
speech. Andy seemed desirous of bringing her out, of making his
cousin understand that here was his pride and his darling, but
Bethel flinched and turned silent, and the unquenchable
Mahala&mdash;that longer-legged Iris&mdash;stepped in.</p>

<p>Apparently, with the success at Topeka and a good house to-
night in Wichita and with this view of a new and richer cousin,
Mahala again saw Andy as a most estimable young artist. She
danced with him and wriggled at him... And the amiable Andy
fell, and Bethel stood back in an indecisive rage at Andy's
indecisiveness.</p>

<p>Before the party there had been the inevitable trunk-packing
in her dressing-room that had always been her worst chore, except
for dragging your own bags across the waiting-room and heaving
them up to a train platform, in towns where there were too few
redcaps and the train halted only three minutes. Now that she was
Lady Capulet, she had twice as much to pack, and this back-
breaking stooping, this fussy patting of frocks on hangers, this
trying to force shut a trunk that was too full, was enough to
soil the glory of acting.</p>

<p>She went so far as to yelp at Doc, in the next dressing-room,
'Oh, for one week when we could leave everything hung up in the
dressing-room!' Appalled at her own sharp voice, she went to
Doc's door and implored him, 'I'm sorry. I didn't think I'd ever
be the kind of actress that kicks all the time.'</p>

<p>He laughed at her.</p>

<p>'My dear, if you never kicked, I'd know that you were just
another amateur that only takes one tour, and finds everything
just lovely&mdash;even railway-stations, beans and no water in
the dressing-room&mdash;and raves so much about it that it makes
the rest of us low, beefing, vulgar troupers sick, and then goes
home and never tours again. Darned if I know which is the real
mark of the professional&mdash;not to kick at the right things or
always to kick at the wrong ones. You're a trouper now!'</p>

<p>It considerably increased Bethel's dislike of packing that
Mahala now had her own maid.</p>

<p>This was a pretty young coloured girl whom they had acquired
in St. Louis. Mahala, herself long a nightly kicker about the
horrors of packing, could now sit in ecstasy, before the after-
theatre party, and watch her dresser do the work. And into every
conversation she could, and did, lug a reference to 'her
dresser'.</p>

<p>And as she packed to-night, remembering Zed's admonition to be
gaudier, Bethel noticed how all her small sacred possessions were
becoming shabby. Her Lady Capulet gowns too, made over from
Mahala's, were shabby. She realized that all the costumes of the
company now shamelessly showed red stains at the neck from grease
paint, and two or three of the men were becoming slack about
make-up. Tony Murphy, who at the beginning had always been in his
dressing-room three-quarters of an hour before curtain rise, now
rushed in, smelling of beer, just at the fifteen-minute call, and
sometimes he went on still wearing his street shoes.</p>

<p>All this frightened her about the fate of the tour even more
than Andy's whisper that, for all the size and enthusiasm of the
audiences in Topeka and Wichita, they hadn't quite met
expenses.</p>

<p><br>
Topeka and Wichita were metropolises, with 66,000 and 115,000
population. But Dalesburg, Kansas, in which they awoke on
Wednesday morning, was not so mammoth. It had 27,000 population,
and the theatre was a motion-picture house, with too large an
auditorium, an almost total lack of acoustics, and an audience
trained to believe that seventy-five cents should be the top for
all theatre seats. Even Zed's passionate exposition, at the high
school in the afternoon, of the superior emotional orgies of the
living stage did not move Dalesburg.</p>

<p>Four hundred and twenty people huddled protectively together
in the centre of an auditorium meant for thirteen hundred. They
felt naked to the cold prairie winds, and were afraid to laugh or
to give that sighing shiver which tells the actors that a love
scene is 'going over'.</p>

<p>It is a fable that the 'fourth wall' of the stage is empty.
There, massed, are the most influential part of the cast: the
audience. On their acting, their timing, their professional
training, depends the contributory vividness of the rest of the
cast. And audiences differ, from night to night, at least as much
as individual actors. An untrained audience is as uncomfortable a
collaborator as an untrained surgeon or an untrained lover.</p>

<p>To-night's audience, at Dalesburg, was the clammiest the
company had ever encountered, and it was not entirely the fault
of Mr. Andrew Deacon &amp; Associates if they played <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i> like the last week of a lawsuit. It wasn't merely that
they dropped lines; they didn't know whether they dropped them or
not.</p>

<p>To-night, after the show, instead of his usual benedictory
'Another day, another dollar', Doc Keezer grunted, 'Well, got the
chores done again, and the cattle are all safe for the night.
Ain't this a hell of a way to earn a living!'</p>

<p><br>
With exasperating innocence Andy went on supposing that it was
a good notion to escort Bethel and Mahala to the train together.
To-night, at Dalesburg, the three of them came out of the theatre
into a world blind with snow, a half-gale that felt uneasy and
threatening, like the gasping pause before a thunderstorm.</p>

<p>Dalesburg was almost taxiless. The citizens felt as suspicious
about a stranger who wasn't driving his own private car as their
cattle-herding grandfathers had about a stranger with no visible
horse.</p>

<p>The three tired and unromantic workers, idle singers of an
idle day in a town where idleness was discreditable, wavered
through snow and blast, holding together, skidding across ice-
scurfed street crossings. They saw the lights of the bleak
station as heaven, and crawled silently into their berths on the
Pullman.</p>

<p>The journey from Dalesburg to their next stand, Alhambra, was
supposed to take two hours and a quarter&mdash;their Pullman to
be picked up by the three-a.m. Westbound, to arrive at a quarter
past five and lie in the yards till seven. But when Bethel
shivered awake at eight in the morning and pulled up her window
shade, she saw, through an unnatural grey night, that they were
somewhere out in the country, in a confusion of cruelly charging
snow. She dressed hastily... On tour, washing and powdering
become rapid and none too delicate... Andy, invariably the
first of the caravan to awaken and be disgustingly cheerful, was
typing at a portable machine in his drawing-room.</p>

<p>'Yump. Full blizzard. We may be stuck here all day, and late
for the show to-night,' he chanted. 'Sit down, darling. I've got
some coffee coming.'</p>

<p>And all day long everybody drank coffee from the diner on the
stranded train, and played cards, and tried to do charades, and
talked about exactly three things: the blizzard, 1 per cent;
Hitler and Stalin, 1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> per cent; and the
theatre, 97 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> per cent. They were gay,
they sang, but all of them except such veteran troupers as Doc
and Challis and Mabel felt apprehensively that they would starve
here, or here, in nameless frozen farm lands, they would freeze
to death. Every time they looked out of the windows the smother
of snow seemed, beyond all mathematics, to be twice as thick. And
though the train heating system, hitched to the great Western
locomotive, did its best, outside it was five above zero, and the
Pullman grew steadily colder, so that you beheld Juliet wearing
her pink bathrobe over her furs, and Lord Capulet with a blanket
around his shoulders.</p>

<p>The dining-car supplies were, by two in the afternoon, reduced
to coffee and griddle cakes.</p>

<p>The train moved now and then, perhaps a mile; and everybody
jumped up and laughed and said that in Alhambra they would have a
'lovely great, big, juicy steak, in a warm dining-room'. They now
saw Alhambra as a combination of Simpson's Chop House and a beach
in Samoa.</p>

<p>By five in the afternoon the storm had thinned to a nasty grey
fog. The train moved on, slowly, and at eight in the evening they
arrived in Alhambra.</p>

<p>The actors could have dined and been made up and have started
the show by eight-thirty, but the scenery had to be trucked to
the theatre, through the tail of the blizzard. Everybody hoped
that there would be no show, but Andy hurried to the theatre and
back and announced that a few hardy lovers of the Bard were
already seated, and he hoped to have the curtain up by nine-
thirty. They all sat down to dinner in the Alhambra House, which
still has vinegar cruets, and there was no question any longer
about the steak being lovely, great, big or juicy. There wasn't
any steak.</p>

<p>Now Alhambra was not so mammoth as Dalesburg. It had nine
thousand population, and the theatre wasn't a theatre&mdash;it
was the auditorium of the high school.</p>

<p>At eight-thirty, Andy commanded them, 'Take your time and eat.
I'm going to the shop and try to keep the customers amused. Zed,
I want you to come with me. You can talk better than I can. You
wouldn't do some ventriloquist tricks for them, would you?'</p>

<p>'I would not!' yelped the outraged Zed, but he went along.</p>

<p>At nine-fifteen, word came to them from Zed that they hoped to
have the curtain up at ten, that sixty-seven patrons were
waiting, and that his ventriloquism had gone over big.</p>

<p>Not even Tony Murphy or Jeff Hoy suggested that it was foolish
to give the play at all. Whatever lamentable crimes they might
conceal, they were troupers.</p>

<p>As they ran along the streets, the town, with its warm lights
shut away from them behind frost-glittering windows, seemed dug-
in and unfriendly to vagabonds.</p>

<p>The dressing-rooms were classrooms, and Bethel was so taken
back to Point Royal College and <i>A Doll's House</i> that she
giggled as she sat in a row with Mahala, Mabel, Charlotte, Iris
and Vera, their small mirrors on school desks and their rouge and
mascara staining the virgin maple slabs dedicated to Evangeline
and the square of X.</p>

<p>And that night, before sixty-seven patrons, they played
well.</p>

<p>For the sixty-seven, feeling as heroic as the actors
themselves, were a good audience who were willing to enjoy
themselves, and the whole show had the gay insanity of a
Christmas party in snowbound mountains.</p>

<p>But to-night was Thursday, and to-night the closing notice did
not come down.</p>

<p>The call board was hung in the school corridor, and the
closing notice was still on it. Bethel thought of <i>A Tale of
Two Cities</i> and the aristocrats awaiting the morning's list of
the condemned. The company sneaked to it, one by one, and stood
in a shaky group, re-re-reading it.</p>

<p>'It <i>would</i> come during a blizzard,' sighed Tudor
Blackwall.</p>

<p>'Say, Andy couldn't just possibly have forgotten to take it
down?' hoped Harry Purvis.</p>

<p>But Andy came by, glanced at the notice, regretfully patted
Hugh Challis's shoulder and passed on.</p>

<p><br>
Between acts Andy called Bethel into his star dressing-
room&mdash;which was the office of the high-school principal. Not
speaking, he held her to him. He was shaking; he seemed to be
weeping without tears.</p>

<p>'The tour's really over, then?' she said.</p>

<p>'Yes. Finish on Saturday. I wish I could say something in
excuse, Beth.'</p>

<p>'I wish I could say something in comfort!'</p>

<p>'Your being here comforts me. You're the only one, baby, that
I want to see... I think that the latest bulletin, as of five
minutes ago, is that Mahala again considers me a poor young
man.'</p>

<p>It was inconceivable that she should be so intimate with this
king whom she had seen red-gold on his red-gold throne six months
ago; but it was doubly and tragically inconceivable that she
shouldn't very much care, and that the touch of his hand should
be only the amiable contact of a passing friend.</p>

<p><br>
He explained to her the deadly financial aspect of the
closing&mdash;and after that not even all her fancy could give
her hope.</p>

<p>They needed about six thousand dollars a week barely to pay
expenses, and on one-night stands, with only six performances a
week, that meant a gross of a thousand dollars a performance. In
Topeka they had grossed $856.50; in Wichita, $922.70; in
Dalesburg, $368.75; but to-night, with the blizzard, they hadn't
done quite so well&mdash;they had just $99.65 in the box
office.</p>

<p>'And so,' said Andy, quite cheerful now that he had pencil in
hand, 'that means an average loss of about four hundred dollars a
day, spread over the past four days&mdash;and all I have in the
world is enough to finish up this week and take us back to New
York. I'll be paying these debts for the next ten years. Well,
it's been worth it. The Forty-niners never had so much fun as a
theatrical tour&mdash;with Hugh and Zed and Mabel and
<i>you!'</i></p>

<p><br>
After the play the younger members of the company left the two
available taxicabs, which were Ford sedans, to the seniors and
ran to the station, Zed and Lyle dragging Bethel through the cold
hell of wind that bit her nose, through the great sculptured
snowdrifts that were golden with purple shadows under the street
lights. And then, since their Pullman would not have heat till it
was connected with a locomotive, they waited for the train in a
small station waiting-room stinking with cheap tobacco,
overheated from a sheet-iron box stove whose sides turned cherry.
Douglas Fry brought out a Temple <i>Hamlet,</i> and they passed
it from hand to hand, reading aloud. Zed made the astonished
station agent, in his coop, seem to be saying, 'This is the
brightest night I've had since Edwin Booth was here when he was
out with <i>Tobacco Road'.</i></p>

<p>Doc Keezer forgot the sanctified, the basic rule of all
trouping, which is, 'I love you, dearie, but carry your own
suitcase', and dragged across the street to a decayed boarding-
house and brought back a gallon of coffee. The train came in, and
they panted to lift their bags aboard before it should
contemptuously pull off without them, and, half undressed, they
fell into a dense sleep, and awoke to tranquil sunshine on the
snow in the vastly greater town of New Prague... population
16,000!</p>

<p><br>
They still had to get through to the fatal Saturday night.</p>

<p>In New Prague, Friday night, they were so successful, their
take was so large, that Andy lost only about two hundred and
fifty dollars that beautiful starry evening.</p>

<p>And so they came to Pike City and to the end.</p>

<p>Pike City had seven thousand population; it was much the
smallest town in which they had played, and the most barren. The
New York booking office, which controlled their fate with all of
Providence's indifference to results, had sent them there because
in Pike City was the Santa Fe Trail Opera House, the grand old
theatre in which four thousand people, cowmen and gamblers and
ladies of a certain fashion, had once listened to Melba and
Patti. Pike City had been larger then and more famous than Dodge
City, and its saloons more crimson. There was still a reckless,
friendly, pioneer blood in the people, but the Romeo Company had
no chance to encounter this. All they saw was one long street,
open at either end to the hungry ferocity of the winter plains,
unprotected and most unprotective of the tender arts, and on
either side of it, streets that after a scattering of small
wooden houses wandered off discouraged and were lost on the
prairie.</p>

<p>'This,' said Andy, at the frame hotel where he would send his
final telegrams, make his final gay long-distance calls, 'is
really the jumping-off place'.</p>

<p>Before an audience next in smallness to the blizzard-blown
huddle at Alhambra, they gave, as their last performance, the
best they had ever done. They played like a May breeze; there was
a lightness to Mahala's pedestrian Juliet; Andy was so manly and
incurably young that Bethel, glowing from the wings, fell in love
with him all over again; Zed was a newly polished blade; and
Bethel, Lady Capulet, had an inner light.</p>

<p>She had youthfully imagined that at the end they would all
sing 'Auld Lang Syne', or else that all the feuds of Tony and Zed
and Jeff against Andy would break out in unconcealed brawling,
now that school was over. But everybody packed mechanically, as
on an ordinary night. Doc Keezer could be heard calmly arguing
that Raymond Massey had played Shakespeare, and the Tony who had
always planned to have a three-day drunk when the run was over
was gurgling bottled orangeade in his dressing-room.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrew Deacon was responsible for transporting all of them
back to New York. As far as Chicago they would occupy the Pullman
which, since St. Louis, had been their home. It would be hitched
on an eastbound train that left Pike City just after midnight, so
there was no time for parties, for regrets, and they hastened
direct from theatre to train.</p>

<p>Bethel saw that Andy was innocent of baggage. 'Where is your
stuff?' she wondered. Then he admitted it:</p>

<p>'I'm not going with you to New York. I'll follow in a few
days, but I have to stay here in Pike City, and, uh, finish up
some bills and things. I'll come soon, and then we'll talk about
our next theatrical venture, kitten.'</p>

<p>This story he told to half a dozen. They all accepted it; they
were busy admiring the bunch of roses for each of the women that
he had conjured out of Pike City. Mahala said that they must dine
together next week. But Bethel noted that Andy got out of the
Pullman, still on a siding, needlessly early, and as he stood on
the cinder-lined ground looking up at it, there was a youthful
desperation about him... It would not be impossible that, left
alone here, in a spasm of loneliness and depression and
humiliation, he might&mdash;</p>

<p>She busied herself with quietly moving her bags one by one to
the farther vestibule platform of the Pullman; then, in the
darkness, lifting them down to the ground and carrying them to
the station platform. She rejoined the bustling, home-going
exiles in the Pullman; she talked of the beauties of New York,
but as the Pullman was attached to the train, she slipped out to
the vestibule again.</p>

<p>She looked back, perhaps for the last time, at her beloved
family: kind Doc and Mabel, already playing pinochle, handsome
old Hugh Challis and&mdash;</p>

<p>She could not endure looking long at him, but her whole vision
was flooded with the sight of Zed Wintergeist as he wedged
himself in a seat between piles of books. His shoulders were
relaxing, strong shoulders on which she would never rest her
forehead. If she was to go, if for loyalty she was to give up
Zed, it must be quickly.</p>

<p>She scuttled down from the vestibule to the platform, on the
dark side of the train, just before the porter closed the
vestibule doors.</p>

<p>When the train moved away, with Andy running beside it and
waving... and crying... she was watching from the station
waiting-room.</p>

<p>Andy tramped away, up Main Street. She left her bags with the
friendly night operator at the station and followed him.</p>

<p>He entered Pete's Lunch&mdash;one of the scores of Pete's
Lunches they had known since New York. He sat at the end of a
long marble-topped table and ordered a hamburger and coffee...
Two nights ago she had been taken back to the memory of dressing
for <i>A Doll's House;</i> now, in the spiral of life, she was
taken back seven years further, to Caryl McDermid and Elsie Krall
at a beanery table in Sladesbury.</p>

<p>She sat two chairs away from him; she ordered coffee in a
half-whisper. Andy did not see her for two minutes. Then he
raised his head, stared at her, dropped his eyes, looked at her
again yes, a 'double take', right out of farce
technique&mdash;and said, as inevitably he must say, 'What are
<i>you</i> doing here? Did the train stop?'</p>

<p>'No. I did. I was worried about you.'</p>

<p>'I couldn't stand seeing any of them again, except you, and I
didn't see how I could detach you from the others. I'm glad you
did the detaching.'</p>

<p>'What are you going to do, Andy?'</p>

<p>'Before I finish this hamburger sandwich, I'm going to decide
whether I'll take my estimable place in Uncle Alex Pilchard's
bank, or start writing to the theatre managers&mdash;the real
managers!&mdash;for a job. And I suppose that decision will
govern the rest of my life.'</p>

<p>'But aren't you broke? You shouldn't have bought us roses. And
listen, Andy, if you are broke&mdash;please let me!&mdash;I've
saved up a little&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Darling! I can wire home for enough to get back to New
York&mdash;though as my faithful secretary you know that's all I
can get, now!'</p>

<p>'But you'll come back to the stage.'</p>

<p>'You bet I will!'</p>

<p>With one of the complete changes she had often seen in Andy,
he was suddenly confident.</p>

<p>'And I won't just go on acting, either. I'll be producing
again, in a couple of years. Maybe as early as this year, I'll
have a summer theatre again&mdash;and not with Roscoe
Valentine&mdash;I don't like the way he gyps the students. I know
where I can get one for almost nothing. And I have plans: A big
Shaw festival in summer, like the musical festival at
Stockbridge! A New York stock company! I can do it now. I've
learned my lesson on this tour. Better casting and stricter
discipline. Oh, a thousand things I want to do....'</p>

<p>He raved on, while Bethel was glad to hear the youth in his
assured voice. He ended abruptly with:</p>

<p>'And that's why I want you to marry me, kitten!'</p>

<p>'Eh?'</p>

<p>'Sort of funny, isn't it!&mdash;proposing to you at Pete's
Lunch, in Pike City, Kansas, with the counterman trying to hear
what we're saying! But it wasn't till I thought you'd gone off on
the train and I was left flat that I realized how for months I've
depended on your affection and loyalty and good sense&mdash;and
your eyes&mdash;always such a gay light in them. Oh, my Beth, I
do long to:</p>

<br>


<p class="verse">'... seize<br>

On the white wonder of dear&mdash;Bethel's&mdash;hand<br>

And steal immortal blessing from her lips.'</p>

<br>

<p>He was holding her hand so tenderly, his smile was so
expectant, that only by compulsion could she make herself
speak:</p>

<p>'Andy, you don't love me the least bit&mdash;really
love&mdash;just all out&mdash;nothing held back.'</p>

<p>'Why of course I do!'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'But anyway, Beth, you love <i>me</i> a little?'</p>

<p>'I don't think so. You're my dearest friend, but you don't
make me into any kind of a glorious fool!'</p>

<p>At that moment Zed Wintergeist walked into the lunchroom and
came up to them, observing without any punctuation:</p>

<p>'It's a damn good thing that train stops at a junction two
miles out I managed to get a fellow to drive me here he stung me
five dollars to drive me here the dirty hound Bethel come here
and stop this nonsense you know we love each other and stop this
nonsense hello Andy.'</p>

<p>Andy spoke. Bethel didn't hear too much of it because her face
was against Zed's coat, which seemed to have grown enormous and
enveloping. But the end of Andy's oration, presented with reason
and a good deal of manly indignation, was:</p>

<p>'... I've stood a lot of impertinence from you, Zed, but
when it comes to your trying to rush my girl off her feet by your
backwoods tactics, I'm&mdash;I'm not going to stand it!'</p>

<p>Zed answered cheerfully, 'Sorry, old man, I really am, but
this seems to have been settled for us.'</p>

<p>'Will you kindly sit down and give me a chance to talk?'</p>

<p>'Okay. I'm hungry.'</p>

<p>Zed casually dropped her into a chair, yanked out a chair for
himself, ordered Western sandwiches all around, and commanded
Andy, 'Shoot!'</p>

<p>But it was at Bethel that Andy scolded:</p>

<p>'I can understand your being fascinated by Zed. But he'll make
you horribly unhappy. He'll be cruel. And he'll never be true to
you.'</p>

<p>Zed cried, with none of his mockery, 'That's a lie! I
<i>will</i> be true to her. I've grown up that much, these last
few weeks. Beth, please believe that!'</p>

<p>Andy was going on&mdash;to Bethel:</p>

<p>'Never. And he'll ignore you. He'll scoff at your dearest
beliefs. He represents the return of barbarism to the theatre,
the revolt against civilization: lights and sound tracks and
trick stages instead of beauty and dignity. He belongs with a
Wild West Show. He's one of the young men who get credit for
genius by wearing flannel shirts and never getting their hair
cut. You can't see <i>him</i> in a gracious New England
farmhouse!'</p>

<p>Quite cheerfully this time, Zed interrupted again: 'I don't
know about that. The guy's a good actor. Maybe he could learn to
feed clover to a polo pony&mdash;is that what you feed polo
ponies?'</p>

<p>Zed had stopped gobbling his sandwich long enough to hold
Bethel's hand. The back of her hand felt cold against the marble
top of the table.</p>

<p>From Andy:</p>

<p>'I won't say anything about your rudeness, Zed. Or your letch
for power over everybody around you. Or your contempt for the
gentler drama, like Barrie. You <i>are</i> a good actor. You have
power and a love of life, and that's what we chiefly need in the
theatre. But I think it's time to speak of myself a little!
Before you charged in, I was telling Beth of some of my future
plans. I'm not sure that, without her help, I can tackle them. I
need her more than ever, now that I'm completely
broke&mdash;'</p>

<p>Zed snarled, 'What does a scion like you mean by "completely
broke"? Only got a hundred thousand dollars left?'</p>

<p>Andy counted the bills in his fold, the change in his
pockets.</p>

<p>'It means that I have, in the whole world, exactly seventeen
dollars and forty-three cents&mdash;plus a promise from my mother
that I shall not get one cent more from her, beyond car-fare to
New York, until she dies. Maybe I really do need a little
coddling.'</p>

<p>Zed stood up abruptly; he spoke earnestly; he looked worn.</p>

<p>'Yes. You do need her, Andy. And when you need her so much,
she won't desert you. This is the one thing that could lick me.
And so: good-bye and bless you both.'</p>

<p>He had started for the door. Bethel flew after him, tugged at
his sleeve. 'Don't! Zed! I won't give you up again! I won't!'</p>

<p>Zed turned with a smile like heaven.</p>

<p>'Not even for what you think is your duty? You love me enough
to give up your baby, your Andy?'</p>

<p>'Oh, Zed, I don't know how much I love you, but I love
you!'</p>

<p>That was late at night on Saturday, January 21st, in Pike
City, Kansas.</p>

<p>They were married in Pike City on Monday the 23rd, and Andy,
the best man, wasn't too insultingly cheerful about it, and Zed
lent him the money for his fare back to New York.</p>

<p><br>
On Thursday, February 16th, Bethel awoke in their 'one-room
apartment' in the Hotel Mountbatten, on West Forty-eighth Street,
and smiled at the sleeping Zed, who was sternly clutching his
pillow, with nothing much of him to be seen but his thick
hair.</p>

<p>In dressing-gown and mules, she cooked their breakfast of
fried eggs and toast and coffee. Their kitchen was a percolator,
a two-burner electric stove, and a pint-sized electric icebox in
the bathroom, and their dining-room did not for the moment exist,
since it was a folding card-table stowed under the bed.</p>

<p>She was singing, minutely, happily.</p>

<p>She went over to kiss his ear and cry, 'Breakfast! Wake up,
stupid, or we'll be late for rehearsal.'</p>

<p>She gave her lord and master the morning paper.</p>

<p>'Looks like war in Europe before 1939 is over,' he yawned. 'If
America gets into it, I'll be just right for cannon
fodder&mdash;strong young gent with no dependants but a smart
wife who can support herself by high-class refined work on the
stage.'</p>

<p>'Will you go in?' fretted Bethel.</p>

<p>'That's like asking somebody if he'll go into an earthquake if
it comes along, or just ignore it. My only propaganda is against
these apologetic actors who say that their work seems
insignificant compared with the big events abroad. Now's just the
time when every artist has got to take even his tiniest job more
seriously than ever, so that civilization may have a chance to go
on. Come on, pet. Let's get going.'</p>

<p>They trotted, arm in arm, two blocks over to the Acanthus
Theatre; entered it proudly not by the stage door but at the
front.</p>

<p>In that dark Mammoth Cave, Bethel sighed like one happily at
home. Only the stage was lighted. On it, Nathan Eldred the stage
manager and Jerome Jordan O'Toole the director were moving chairs
about, to outline an imaginary set that would represent a New
York penthouse.</p>

<p>It was the first rehearsal of <i>Alas in Arcady,</i> a comedy
about a world-weary New Yorker who was smug about his
cosmopolitan vices until he went for vacation to a New England
village and, among the young jitterbugs, discovered that he was
nothing but an old-fashioned Puritan.</p>

<p>Zed was to play a country beau, and Bethel his girl, whom the
alarmed urbanite tried to reform.</p>

<p>'We may not have another chance to play together till we
organize our own company&mdash;as we <i>will!</i>&mdash;so let's
enjoy it, my rabbit,' said Zed.</p>

<p>O'Toole shook hands. 'Glad to see you children. Here's your
parts. I'll give you an hour to look 'em over, and then we'll
start right in walking the play.'</p>

<p>A man with silver hair but a face round and youngish marched
out on the stage.</p>

<p>'Do you know Caryl McDermid?' said O'Toole. 'This is Mr. and
Mrs. Zed Wintergeist&mdash;Beth Merriday.'</p>

<p>'I've never had the pleasure of seeing them before,' said
McDermid, 'but I've heard a great deal about you, Zed. I hear
you're our future Sacha Guitry. It'll be a pleasure to play with
you.'</p>

<p>'Beth is to be your daughter, Caryl&mdash;on the stage, I
mean,' said O'Toole.</p>

<p>'Off-stage too, I hope, when we get into the terrors of
touring,' said McDermid. 'Have you done any touring, Miss
Merriday?'</p>

<p>'Oh, sure&mdash;she's a veteran trouper&mdash;she's a real
actress,' said Jerome Jordan O'Toole.</p>

<p>'You bet she is!' said Zed.</p>

<p>So Bethel had come home, and it was good.</p>
